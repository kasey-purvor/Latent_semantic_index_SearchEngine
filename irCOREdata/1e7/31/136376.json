On the macro front \nthere can be general agreement that large budget deficits and real exchange rates that are \nseriously out of line with competitive real rates will create major problems, but beyond \nthat in terms of a range of other policies there are many points of debate.1\n \n Paradoxically \nwhilst one consensus was breaking down in the late 1990\u2019s, another was forming within \nthe donor community on the overriding importance of poverty reduction and on the key \nmechanisms to achieve it. This paper examines the Aid paradigm that has emerged in \nrelation to poverty reduction. It sets out the shared assumptions of a selection of key \ninstitutions gleaned from their strategy statements and reports the empirical evidence on \nthe validity of these assumptions, drawn in particular from recent work on Asia that the \nauthor has been involved with. The conclusion is nuanced - the evidence broadly supports \nthe paradigm but simple interpretations can be misleading and care is required in its \napplication in specific circumstances.   \nPoverty Reduction: the overriding goal. \n \n  The Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) reflect the aspirations of the donor \ncommunity with the poverty target of halving extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015, \nno doubt symbolically, set as the first goal. The broad dimensions of the paradigm can be \nseen from the strategy statements circa the year 2000 of some of the central players of the \naid community - the World Bank, two key regional banks the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Department for \nInternational Development (DFID), the UK Development agency- on how to reduce \npoverty. The World Bank in World Bank (2000: 6-8) wrote of a three-pronged approach \nof promoting opportunity, (through economic growth, with an acknowledgement of the \nsignificance of the pattern of growth), facilitating empowerment (particularly through \ngreater participation and improvements in governance) and enhancing security \n(particularly through the strengthening of the assets and human capital of the poor).  The \nAsian Development Bank in its Long-Term Strategic Framework, ADB (2001) stressed \nthree core strategic areas of sustainable economic growth (that raised incomes, created \njobs and reversed environmental degradation), improvement in governance (including \ngreater participation as part of improved governance) and social development (in terms of \nimprovements in health and education and thus the human capital of the poor). The Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank in IDB (2003: 6-12) wrote of the need for sustainable \neconomic growth, democratic governance (that facilitates growth, empowers the poor and \nhelps ensure that growth is broad and participatory), human development (that \nstrengthens human capital), social protection (that reduces the vulnerability of the poor \nand enhances their economic security) and political and social inclusion (that improves \nthe governance structure). DFID (2000a: 25-43) identified the key elements of pro-poor \n                                                 \n1 Rodrik (2006) writes of Washington \u2018Confusion\u2019 replacing Consensus. \neconomic growth (specifically making markets work for the poor), effective government \n(particularly though combating corruption, respect for human right and reductions in \nconflicts) and investment in people (though better health and education and higher skills). \n \n  Although there is some difference in terminology the similarities are clear. The key \ncommon denominators are the focus on growth (with both pro-poor and sustainable \ndimensions identified), governance (and by implication greater empowerment for the \npoor) and social development (leading to improved human capital). The logic is one of \ncumulative progress where advance on one front reinforces that on another.2\n \n  Figure 1 \nsets out a schematic versions of the inter-relations with the bold lines showing the major \ndirections of causation and the dotted lines showing weaker feedback relations. Thus \nimproved governance will have a positive impact on growth (for example through a \nstrengthened legal system) and on social development (though more effective delivery of \nsocial programs). Growth will reduce poverty (for example through job creation) and \nimprove social development (for example through higher government revenue for social \nprogrammes). Poverty reduction in turn will have a positive (but weaker) impact on \ngrowth (for example by bringing the poor into productive activity) and on social \ndevelopment (for example by allowing children to attend school). Social development \nmay also have a positive (but weaker) impact on governance (for example as the poor can \nparticipate more fully) and on growth (for example through the productivity effect of \ntheir higher human capital). \n \n  Insert figure 1  \n \n \n \nNaturally this simplifies a complex reality and in the short-term at least it is clear there \nmay be trade-offs (for example between growth and social development and between \ngrowth and distribution). The growth versus social development trade-off is to be avoided \nby striving to protect the government social expenditures on health and education that \nserve the poor, so these are not sacrificed in favour of more growth-oriented programmes. \nThe growth versus distribution tension inherent in any poverty reduction strategy is \nresolved primarily in favour of growth, with little focus on re-distributional measures. \nThe references to \u2018pro-poor growth\u2019 that were common circa 2000 usually meant growth \nfrom which the poor can benefit rather than the more intuitive meaning of growth that \ndisproportionately benefits the poor.3\n                                                 \n2 This is explicit in World Bank (2000) and ADB (2001) \n More recent discussions (for example World Bank \n2006a) focus on \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 implying growth from which the poor have equal \n3 For example DFID (2000b) defines pro-poor growth as growth that \u201cincludes the poor by maximizing \ntheir opportunities and by utilizing their skills, time and physical resources\u201d (DFID 2000). A more rigorous \ndefinition based on welfare axioms is provided by Ravallion (2004) who defines pro-poor growth (p) as the \nmean growth rate of the incomes of the poor. Here p = g*d, where g is actual mean income growth and d is \na distributional term given by the ratio of actual decrease in poverty divided by the decrease in poverty if \nthere had been no distributional change over the growth period. Hence if distributional change favours the \npoor d will exceed 1.0 and pro-poor growth p will exceed mean growth. \n \nopportunity to benefit, as obstacles relating to either market imperfections, geography or \nethnic and social divisions are removed. In part this new focus reflects the evidence on \nrising inequality in a number of countries.4\n \n Growth in these discussions is typically \nreferred to as \u2018sustainable\u2019, in the broad sense of non-damaging to the environment. \nAgain there have been many discussions of what this actually means in practice. At a \nproject level it is now standard to conduct impact assessments and to build in appropriate \nmitigatory measures. Going beyond this to reverse degradation and address regional and \nglobal climatic impacts is much more difficult and requires interventions to meet explicit \nenvironmental goals. Progress here is much less clear.   \nIn terms of specific aid interventions donors have focused on four broad areas   \n \n- physical infrastructure projects in traditional infrastructure sectors where the \nprivate sector was not interested to invest;  \n- social development expenditures of either a hard type (for example construction \nof schools and clinics) or soft type (for example training, curricula, innoculation \nprograms);  \n- narrowly targeted interventions to reach the very poor (for example with credit, \nfood, roads, electrification, slum improvement); \n- institutional change to improve governance and the enabling environment for the \nprivate sector. \n \nThe first of these was to address the growth objective, with some possible direct effects \non poverty, the second and third to improve social development and the last to address \ngovernance and institutional issues.5\n \n \nThe above discussion is simplified but as a set of generalizations it should have enough \nvalidity to allow a check on the key assumptions and mechanisms of the paradigm against \nthe substantial body of empirical evidence.   \n \n \nWhat do we know of the causes of poverty reduction? \n \nDespite increasingly sophisticated estimation techniques and the apparent precision of the \nfirst MDG (on halving extreme poverty 1990-2015) global and national poverty remains \n                                                 \n4 For Asia, Ali and Zhuang (2007 table 2) report rising Gini coefficients in  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, \nIndia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam). These contrast with falls in \ninequality in Thailand, Malaysia and Mongolia and a virtually static position in Indonesia. However there is \nstill little evidence establishing a systematic relationship between growth and changes in equality; see  \nFields (2001) and Adams (2004).  \n5 There are similarities with the diagnosis of the Sachs report (UN 2005) on countries making poor progress \non achieving the MDGs. It stresses four broad explanations for failures to meet targets; poor governance, \n\u2018poverty traps\u2019 (where countries are too poor to make the necessary investments), \u2018pockets of poverty\u2019 \n(where there are major backward regions in a country) and policy neglect (particularly in relation to \nenvironmental management). The solution it proposes varies with the cause of non-achievement of targets. \nIn the first instance the key will be governance reform, and in the last instance a shift to more informed \npolicies. For the poverty trap and pockets of poverty cases a \u2018big push\u2019 financed by aid funds is \nrecommended. This is to be concentrated on physical and social infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. \ndifficult to quantify with accuracy. There has been substantial debate about poverty data \nand discrepancies have emerged between alternative measures based on household \nsurveys, or the national accounts. There is also the technical problem that for \ninternational comparisons, as what is to be measured is the poor\u2019s access to goods and \nservices the conversion must be at a purchasing power parity not the nominal exchange \nrate.. Poverty estimates have proved highly sensitive to errors and changes in purchasing \npower parity exchange rates. \n \nDespite these acknowledged difficulties very considerable empirical work has been \ncarried out and one of the key stylized facts of recent development experience is the \nrelationship between economic growth (the increase in mean income) and absolute \npoverty reduction (a decline in the population share below an agreed poverty line). Using \nthe $1\/day poverty line most cross country estimates derive an elasticity of about -2.0 for \nthe poverty headcount in response to an increase in per capita income, so a 1% increase \nin income per capita is associated with a 2% fall in the poverty measure (World Bank \n2000).6\n \n Such elasticities are merely an average relationship with the possibility for wide \ncountry variations with initial inequality and its change over a growth period influencing \nhow far the poor benefit.  The possibility for wide country variation in the response of \npoverty to growth is highlighted in the results of Warr (2000) who on the basis of time \nseries analyses in individual countries finds the elasticity of the headcount measure of \npoverty to growth ranging from a low of -0.7 in the Philippines to a high of -2.0 in \nThailand. This seems readily explicable by the fact that the Philippines experienced a rise \ninequality from the mid 1980\u2019s, whilst Thailand experienced a fall. Similarly China and \nIndia show strikingly different poverty-growth elasticities of -2.6 and -1.0, respectively, \nwith the hypothesized explanation greater access to land by the poor in China (Chaudhuri \nand Ravallion 2006: table 1).  \nThe growth-poverty-inequality nexus was examined in the well known paper by Dollar \nand Kraay (2002) looking at the relation between changes in the income of the poor \n(taken as the mean income of the bottom quintile) and growth (change in mean income). \nTheir widely cited result of on average a close to one to one relationship can be \ninterpreted as confirmation of the result noted above that on average there seems in the \npast to have been no systematic relation between growth and changes in income \ndistribution. With no change in distribution the poor will benefit proportionately to the \nsame extent as everyone else, although their absolute gain will be much less than those at \nthe higher end of the income distribution. However, once again this average relation has \nbeen shown not to apply in individual countries. In time series case studies Balisacan and \nPernia (2003) find an income poverty elasticity (ratio of the change in income of the poor \nto the change in mean income) of 0.54 for the Philippines and in a similar exercise for \nIndonesia Balisacan et al (2003) find an income poverty elasticity of 0.71. Hence rather \nthan the one to one relation, in the Philippines the poor received just over half the \nnational average proportionate gain and in the Indonesia roughly two-thirds. Again this is \nreadily explicable in terms of estimates of inequality and its change in the two countries.  \n \n                                                 \n6 In such exercises growth typically accounts for between half and two thirds of the variation in poverty \nwith the rest due to inequality and its change over time. \nGiven the significance of national variation in the growth-poverty links a critical question \nis what policy interventions have worked to reduce poverty, either directly or through \ntheir growth effect.  \n \nHow successful have direct poverty interventions been? \n \nVarious forms of targeting have been used in an attempt to transfer resources to poor \nhouseholds both as part of short-run responses to short-run crises or as apart of longer \nterm support. These include measures such as free or subsidized basic commodities, cash \ntransfers, employment creation schemes, infrastructure investments in backward areas \nand microfinance.7\n \n In addition to these \u2018narrow targeting\u2019 measures, there was also \n\u2018broad targeting\u2019 in the sense of a focus of public expenditure on programs like primary \nhealth care and primary education judged to benefit the poor disproportionately. By and \nlarge experience with these distribution-oriented interventions has been disappointing \nwith most measures suffering from the twin problems of under-coverage (so many of the \npoor were missed) and leakage (so a significant proportion of benefits went to the non-\npoor).  \nSubsidized foodstuffs often leaked to the market for sale at a commercial price; for \nexample for the subsidized rice program in Indonesia at the time of the Financial Crisis \nroughly one quarter of beneficiaries were not poor and only roughly half the target group \nwere reached (Maxwell and Perdana 2005). Even the zakat system of Islamic charity that \nprovides cash transfers to the poor and destitute has been found to have a significant \nleakage, although probably less so than for other cash transfer schemes; in urban areas \nroughly two-thirds of recipients in Pakistan are outside the bottom quintile (Arif 2006). \nEmployment guarantee programmes now have a major role in poverty alleviation in India \nalthough their past record is again disappointing with high costs per job and in places \nevidence that the level of wages set have encouraged those just above or around the \npoverty line to take up the schemes (Srivastava 2005). \n \n Location targeting giving priority to expenditure in backward areas has been an \nimportant policy tool, particularly in geographically large countries. However it has also \nproved a relatively imprecise measure missing the poor who live in non-backward areas \nand not excluding all of the non-poor in the target area. In PRC, for example, between \n30% and 40% of the poor were estimated to live in non-poor counties in the 1990\u2019s and \nalthough there was evidence that the poor county program raised county level income, \nhow much of this went to the poor was unclear (Wang 2005).  Regional policy in \nThailand has operated so that there is no clear negative association link between \nprovincial income per capita and receipts per capita under poverty reduction programmes, \nimplying a failure of targeting at the provincial level (Warr and Sarntisart 2005). There is \nno automatic guarantee that the poor will always benefit disproportionately from health \nand education expenditure, since this will depend on the nature of the programmes and \nhow they are funded. However there is the potential for such benefits from well designed \nprimary education and healthcare interventions. For example, there are estimates for \nIndonesia showing proportionately higher gains for the bottom quintile from primary \n                                                 \n7 Studies in Weiss (2005) examine the effectiveness of such measures in a number of countries.  \nhealth and education expenditure (Morrison 2002). None the less this is not an inevitable \noutcome. \n \nMicrofinance is widely regarded as an innovative and effective means of reaching the \npoor, although it is often viewed as a route out of poverty for those clustered around the \npoverty line rather than for the core or chronic poor. However work on Pakistan \ndemonstrates the effectiveness of micro credit in raising the living standards of very poor \nborrowers, whilst the bank concerned pursued its own commercial objectives \n(Montgomery 2006). The difficulties with targeting measures are a combination of \ngovernance and technical issues. Poor governance has no doubt contributed to much of \nthe leakage, however there have also been technical problems in identifying precisely \nwho the most needy are and where they are located. These operational difficulties must \npartly explain why high leakage rates are found in countries with diverse political \ntraditions and levels of corruption (such as India and Indonesia). For its advocates, the \nattraction of microfinance with its reliance on self-targeting and increasingly on the \ncommercial incentives of banks is that it avoids most of these problems. \n \nHow has trade reform impacted on poverty? \n \n \nTrade reform has been an important although still controversial aspect of reform \nprogrammes supported by donors. Theory suggests that if trade reform, in terms of lower \nbarriers, accompanied by exchange rate adjustment, can stimulate exports (principally of \nlabour-intensive goods) and raise growth it will be poverty reducing. This is the standard \nassumption in donor country programmes. However even if this favourable scenario \nworks out in the long-run, theory also allows for the possibility of short-run losses for \nsome, including the poor, out of the relative price effects, and the output and employment \nre-allocation generated by significant reform. In their authoritative survey of the impact \nof trade reform on poverty Winters et al (2004: 107) comment \u201c while there are many \ncauses of optimism that trade liberalization will contribute positively to poverty \nreduction, the ultimate outcome depends on many factors\u201d; however they also note that  \n\u201c\u2026.concerns that trade liberalization has generally adverse effects on the employment or \nwages of poor people or on government spending on the poor due to falling fiscal \nrevenues are not well founded, even though specific instances of each of these problems \ncan be identified.\u201d Modelling work by Khan (2006) supports the view of a lack of serious \nnegative effects on the poor in the short-run even for an archetype South Asia economy \nstarting with an average tariff of 40%. In so far as growth is raised through higher exports \nthere will be positive longer-run effects on poverty. \n \nApart from the general link between higher exports, growth and employment, some of the \nstrongest evidence of the positive effect of trade reform on poverty is where it leads to a \nrelative price rise for poor producers of internationally tradable crops. This has been \ndocumented for example in the case of rice growers in Vietnam and Indonesia (Winters et \nal 2004).  However care is still needed in interpreting these results since such price rises \nbenefit net producers of the crops and hurt net consumers. In a detailed study of these \nambiguous outcomes in the Philippines using a macro modelling approach Cororaton \n(2006) shows that while liberalization of import controls on rice is poverty reducing \noverall, some of the poorest groups lose since they will have to buy rice at higher prices \nthat have now risen to world market levels. He also simulates the effect of alternative \ncompensatory mechanisms necessary to offset these effects on the very poor. The \nimplication is that to fully address poverty concerns trade reform must be part of a policy \npackage that considers the range of possible poverty consequences, with compensatory \nmeasures built in where negative effects are identified. \n \nWhen it comes to inequality there is now mounting evidence that trade reform as part of \nthe globalization process may have exacerbated inequality by raising the returns to capital \nand skilled labour relative to unskilled labour. Causation is difficult to confirm but in \nmany cases increased openness to trade and capital flows has been accompanied by rising \ninequality (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007). Different mechanisms have been suggested to \naccount for this association including biases in technical change and a weakening in the \nbargaining power of organized labour. One persuasive argument links changes in equality \nto the spread of global production networks. This is on the grounds that it will be the \nlabour-intensive parts of such networks that are located in poorer countries with lower \nwages. However whilst the products that are outsourced in this way will have a low \nskilled to unskilled labour ratios in rich countries they will often be relatively skilled \nlabour intensive in the poorer countries to which production is outsourced. Hence it will \nbe the wages of skilled labour that rise relative to that of unskilled in the host country. \nThis argument has been used, for example, to explain distributional shifts in Mexico after \nits entry to NAFTA (Feenstra and Hanson 1996). The general point is that the evidence \nthat trade reform and globalization add to absolute poverty is fairly weak, however in \nrelative terms because of distributional shifts there is greater cause for concern. \n \nHow far do social improvements follow income growth? \n \n There is fairly conclusive evidence that social improvements do not follow automatically \nfrom economic growth in the fact that most of the monitoring exercises on progress \ntowards the MDGs suggest that income poverty targets are largely on track in most \ncountries outside sub-Saharan Africa (largely due to growth performance) but that social \nindicators, like infant mortality rates, some of the gender equality measures and access to \nclean water and sanitation lag behind (see for example UNESCAP et al 2006, and UN \n2005). More formal cross-country analyses confirm that pro-poor expenditure may itself \nhave little direct impact. \n \nA readily available welfare measure is the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) that \ncombines a measure of income (GDP per capita in purchasing power parity terms) with \nindicators for health (life expectancy) and education (enrolment ratios). Across countries \nthere is no correlation between change in the HDI and economic growth (although there \nis a correlation with change in growth). Detailed analysis of the impact of the most \npotentially \u2018pro-poor\u2019 public expenditures (water and sanitation, education and health) \nfinds no direct association between the HDI and an index of such expenditure for low \nincome countries, although there is a significant positive relation for middle income \ncountries. Infant mortality rates have also been used separately as an alternative welfare \nmeasure and here whilst income levels and aid are strongly and negatively associated \nwith infant mortality the public expenditure index is not a significant explanatory variable \n(Gomanee et al 2005). These results whilst reflecting no more than country averages \nillustrate the point that achieving social development through higher public expenditure is \nby no means a simple task, although there will no doubt have been cases where such \nexpenditures have contributed to social development and benefited the poor \ndisproportionately. In particular the links between expenditure on water and sanitation \nand improved health outcomes have been demonstrated and an improved transportation \nnetwork has been shown to improve school attendance (Fay et al 2003). The implication \nis that to achieve social development target public expenditure under a \u2018broad targeting\u2019 \nstrategy still needs to be well designed.  \n \n \n How do physical and social infrastructure impact on growth and poverty reduction? \n \nInfrastructure activity has conventionally been a central arm of donor activity in part \nbecause with the externality and public good characteristics of some infrastructure \nprojects they meet the market failure rationale for public sector involvement. \nInfrastructure is also expected to have a direct impact on growth. The case for physical \ninfrastructure impacting directly on growth is intuitively clear. Transport is needed to \nmove goods between producers and consumers, power provides the energy for \neconomically productive activity and telecommunications provides the information flows \nnecessary for trade and production. Similarly soft or social infrastructure provides the \ninstitutional base for productive activity and their improvement can impact significantly \non the incentive to invest.  \n \n \nThere have been many efforts to quantify the economic impact of infrastructure using a \nvariety of methodologies. Macro analyses using a production function approach have \ngenerally derived very high, perhaps implausibly high, rates of return, which are higher in \nlow income countries.8 An alternative approach is to link infrastructure with \u2018trade costs\u2019 \nand test for the sensitivity of trade flows to reductions in these non-tariff barriers on the \nassumption that higher trade flows create higher incomes.9\n \n  \nEmpirical analyses of the impact of infrastructure across countries based on a form of \ngrowth accounting, up to recently have suffered from problems of measurement (how to \nquantify infrastructure accurately in an index) and causation (how to be sure that \ncausation does not run from growth to infrastructure rather than the other way around). \nBoth obstacles have been largely overcome in recent years. Data compilation at the \n                                                 \n8 \u201cIn recent years these methods have suggested economic returns on investment projects averaging 30-40 \npercent for telecommunications, more than 40 percent for electricity generation and more than 200 percent \nfor roads (although when outliers are excluded the average is about 80 percent for roads\u201d (Estache 2004:4).  \n9 Macroeconomic modelling can simulate the impact of reductions in trade costs due to improvements in \ninfrastructure as well as any total factor productivity gains due to infrastructure improvements; see Roland \nHolst (2006). \n \nWorld Bank has now created a comprehensive infrastructure database that can be used to \nderive synthetic weighted indices of infrastructure stock both in terms of quantity and \nquality (Canning 1998). Such developments have allowed rigorous assessment of the \nimpact of infrastructure. For example, Calderon and Serven (2005) in a cross sectional \nanalysis covering 121 countries 1960 -2000 test for the impact of infrastructure stocks on \ngrowth and inequality. They find that infrastructure has a significant and positive impact \non growth (that is not due to any reverse impact from growth to infrastructure) and in a \nseparate model they find infrastructure to have a significant negative impact on \ninequality. These results are robust to changes in the infrastructure measures used. In \nsupport of the paradigm\u2019s reasoning the authors argue that \u201c the conclusion that \ninfrastructure both raises growth and lowers income inequality implies that infrastructure \ndevelopment may be a key win-win ingredient  for poverty reduction\u201d (p 27). \n \nInfrastructure,  poverty and welfare \n \nThe positive infrastructure-growth relation suggests that in turn infrastructure will lower \npoverty. This could be through its growth effect or it could be directly via distributional \nshifts that impact on the poor. Empirically in cross-country analyses it is difficult to \nestablish infrastructure-poverty links that do not run via growth. For example, in a \nregression analysis Jalilian and Weiss (2006) find that their synthetic infrastructure index \nhas no significant relation with poverty headcount measures when it is included \nseparately with growth, although the latter variable is always strongly significant.10\n \n  \n \nThe lack of a direct relationship between the infrastructure index and poverty measures is \nno doubt due to the fact that only certain types of infrastructure activity will have major \ndirect poverty consequences. To establish these requires a focus on country or sector case \nstudies and a variety of methodologies have been used for this purpose. Much of the \nevidence relates to infrastructure activities that serve the poor directly, principally rural \nroads and electrification. For example, Fan and others employ a simultaneous equation \nmodel to investigate the impact of different types of public expenditure on production \nand poverty through a variety of channels. The model was first applied to India (Fan et al \n1999) and subsequently to PRC (Fan et al 2002), with a later unpublished application to \nThailand on behalf of the Bank. In the model rural poverty will be affected through \nvarious channels such as changes in agricultural production, non\u2013agricultural \nemployment, wages and the internal terms of trade. For India government expenditure on \nrural roads dominated all other categories of expenditure in terms of its poverty reduction \nimpact with a much higher poverty impact per unit of expenditure. The impact of roads \non poverty consists of roughly 25% in terms of higher agricultural productivity, 55% in \nhigher non-agricultural employment and the remaining 30% due to higher rural wages. \n                                                 \n10 Only if the infrastructure index is interacted with an education variable (school enrolment ratio) does it \nbecome significant with the expected negative sign, implying that a better educated population is better \nplaced to take advantage of the opportunities for poverty reduction offered by infrastructure. Similarly in \ntheir country study of the Philippines, Balisacan and Pernia (2003) find that a variable for electricity has no \nsignificant relation with poverty and one for roads is significantly and positively related. The expected sign \nfor roads is only obtained by interacting the variable with a schooling measure. \nFor India however the results show very low and statistically insignificant poverty effects \nfrom the other infrastructure categories irrigation and power. The low return to irrigation \nis rationalised in that past investment had already allowed for higher yields as a part of \nthe Green Revolution and that given this adequate infrastructure stock marginal returns \nfrom additional investment would be very low. \n \nFor China a different pattern of results emerge. Here in terms of poverty reduction it is \ninvestment in social infrastructure (education and agricultural research and development) \nthat dominate all other expenditure categories, particularly in the poorer Western region. \nOf the three physical infrastructure categories considered there is consistency with the \nIndian results in that rural roads have a stronger poverty impact than telecommunications, \npower or irrigation. In China the impact of these infrastructure activities on poverty is \nlargely through their contribution to higher non-farm employment and increased rural \nwages. Again irrigation shows the lowest poverty effect, although it overall growth effect \nis positive and higher than for power.11\n \n  \nAn alternative approach is applied to rural roads in Lao PDR in Warr (2006). Lao has a \nvery difficult topography and many villages have no all-weather road access. Household \nexpenditure survey data is available at two points in time and this allows the specification \nof a regression model to explain household consumption expenditure. Consumption is \nexplained by household characteristics (like age and education of head of household and \nownership of assets like cattle), village characteristics (like access to electricity) and the \nstatus of road access. Predicted expenditure and implied poverty levels derived from this \nmodel can be compared with the expenditure and poverty predicted when village road \nstatus is varied from the actual to all-year access (or alternatively dry season access only). \nThe difference in poverty levels under the alternative road status scenarios gives an \nestimate of the overall poverty impact of a major road building programme. The results \nsuggest the poverty impact would be very substantial as granting all household all-\nweather access is estimated to lower the incidence of rural poverty by 7 percentage \npoints. Looking back over past investment the approach suggests roughly one sixth of the \npoverty reduction that actually took place between the two survey dates was due to road \nimprovements.  \n \nEvidence of the importance of rural electrification in poverty reduction is provided for \nthe Philippines by Balisacan and Edillon (2005). Using the coefficients from an earlier \nregression model and estimates of costs for different public projects they simulate \noutcomes from different expenditure packages. The proportion of households nationally \nwithout electricity is 30% and a programme to bring electricity to all of these shows high \n                                                 \n11 Similarly, evidence of the impact of rural infrastructure more generally is also found at the county level \nin China where infrastructure facilities are found to be a key determinant of household consumption growth \nin an analysis across counties (Jalan and Ravallion 2002). The \u2018spatial poverty trap\u2019 hypothesis (Jalan and \nRavallion 1998) was advanced initially in the context of China. It argues that the returns to household \nassets in a locality are depressed by the low stock of physical and social infrastructure and that through \nexternalities there are high returns to investing in a package of infrastructure measures to serve the \ndisadvantaged localities.  \n  \neconomic returns and a higher impact on the poor per unit of expenditure than any of the \nalternatives.  \n \n \nHence there is ample evidence from varying sources and countries that well designed \ninfrastructure schemes in rural areas can make a difference to poverty directly by \nproviding services and market opportunities to the poor; which type of infrastructure \nactivity will generate the highest poverty impact will vary with circumstances and the \nnature of the binding constraints on poverty reduction.  \n \n \nWhat are the links between governance, growth and poverty? \n \nThere is a growing literature that argues that establishing a favourable governance \nenvironment is the key to sustained economic growth. In addition there can be some \npositive direct impact from governance to both social development and poverty \nreduction. Hence in this view whilst there are feedbacks of various types it is the \ngovernance-growth link that provides the key relation (see Figure 1 above). \n \nAt one level this conclusion is virtually a tautology, since if governance is defined \nbroadly as the means of organizing and running a society and economy then clearly it is \nimportant for economic success for there to be \u2018good governance\u2019. There is scope for \nconfusion in policy discussion since there are various dimensions of governance. In their \nmajor empirical work on indices of governance Kaufmann et al (2003, 2005) use the \ngeneral definition of \u201cthe traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is \nexercised.\u201d They focus on three \u2018governance clusters\u2019 with various indicators involved in \neach cluster; \n \n- the political process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced \n(covering for example measures of civil liberties and political rights) \n- the capacity of a government to formulate and implement policy (covering for \nexample policy credibility, the quality of the bureaucracy and regulatory processes) \n- the respect of citizens and the state for national institutions (covering for example, \nthe rule of law, property rights and contract enforcement, judicial independence, \ncontrol of corruption). \n \nThis is a wide-ranging list with different dimensions likely to be of differing degrees of \nimportance for economic growth. Broadly speaking the three clusters correspond to the \nthree aspects of governance raised most frequently in popular discussion \u2013 \u2018democracy\u2019, \n\u2018government effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018the rule of law\/corruption\u2019.   \n \n \n Evidence on governance, growth and poverty \n \nIf institutions are the rules of a particular governance environment there is mounting \nevidence that they are the key fundamental determinant of growth. Proximate causes of \ngrowth may be factor accumulation and technical change, but the fundamental \ndeterminants will be the forces that drive these proximate causes. This evidence on the \nrole of institutions comes partly from disappointing country experiences with \nconventional economic reform programmes in the absence of significant institutional \nchange (the relative failure of \u2018first generation reform\u2019) and partly from increasingly \nsophisticated cross-country analyses that use measures institutional quality, along with \nother control variables, to explain cross country growth experience.  \n \nTechnically establishing the link between institutions and growth has been complex \nbecause of the endogenous nature of institutional change that evolves as part of the \ngrowth process and because of the difficulty of quantifying institutional quality.  \nHowever there is now a consistent body of studies that finds a strong positive correlation \nbetween various measures of institutional quality and economic growth with strong \nevidence that causation runs principally from institutions to growth, rather than in the \nopposite direction (Acemoglu et al 2001, Kaufmann and Kraay 2002, Kaufmann et al \n2005). In an important paper Rodrik et al (2004) contrast the impact of institutions with \nthat of the other candidate fundamental determinants of growth from the recent literature \n\u2013 openness to trade and geography. They find conclusively that \u201cthe quality of \ninstitutions \u2018trumps\u2019 everything else. Once institutions are controlled for measures of \ngeography have at best weak direct effects on incomes\u2026 similarly once institutions are \ncontrolled for trade is almost always insignificant..\u201d  \n \nRecent exercises along these lines rely heavily on the Kaufmann et al measures of \ninstitutions and their realism is heavily dependent on the accuracy these measures.12 \nWhilst countries with high or low quality institutions may be easy to identify quantifying \nthe range for the majority of countries in between is far from easy. The preferred measure \nfrom Kaufmann et al appears to be the rule of law index on the grounds that this covers \nintuitive notions of the role of contract enforcement and property rights (for example this \nis the index used in Rodrik et al 2004). Recently, however, Jalilian et al (2007) have \nexamined the impact on growth of the effectiveness of government administration and the \nquality of regulation using the indices from Kaufmann et al. They find these \nadministrative and regulatory variables to have a strong growth effect controlling for \nother factors. In addition they provide some suggestive evidence that the growth effect of \nthese variables is stronger than that of the other dimensions of governance as measured \nby Kaufmann et al. Hence from this evidence there is a suggestion that the rule of law per \nse is less important than an effective government administrative structure.13\n  \n  \n Corruption (typically defined as \u2018the use of public office for private gain\u2019) is the aspect \nof governance that has received the most attention in donor circles in recent years. This is \npartly because of its assumed impact on the use of resources destined initially for the \n                                                 \n12 The authors themselves caution that \u201cmargins of error remain substantial relative to the units in which \ngovernance is measured and these margins of error need to be taken seriously when comparing countries \nwith each other or over time. This is especially the case when attempting to classify countries into groups \naccording to their levels of governance..\u201d (Kaufmann et al 2003: 39). \n13 This result comes from the higher coefficient on a weighted variable combining the effectiveness and \nregulatory indices in comparison with weighted combinations of the other governance indices. The authors \nthemselves caution that they would not wish to overemphasise the result given the data limitation issues.  \npoor (so corruption leads to weak targeting) and partly because it is assumed to lead to \nlower overall growth, as rent-seeking associated with corruption diverts resources from \nproductive activity. The impact of this aspect of governance has also been incorporated in \ncross-country empirical analyses. Various measures of corruption are available but again \nthe Kaufmann et al series is often taken as the most rigorous.14\n \n The bulk of empirical \nstudies find that controlling for other factors corruption tends to have a significant \nnegative impact on both growth and investment, including FDI. This is substantiated by \nthe result of investor surveys from some countries (Cambodia, Indonesia and the \nPhilippines in East Asia) where corruption is identified as a serious constraint on business \n(World Bank 2006b: table 7.1).   \n However there is a more nuanced story when one considers that some of the present \n(Korea, China) and past (Indonesia) high-growth economies have been characterised by \nhigh degrees of corruption by international standards. This \u2018East Asian paradox\u2019 is \nsupported by a comprehensive cross-country study using four alternative indicators of \ncorruption (of which the Kaufmann et al Control of Corruption index is the most \nrigorous) (Rock and Bennett 2004). For the Kaufmann et al index (but not the others) as \nexpected higher corruption is associated with significantly lower economic growth and a \nlower investment share across all developing countries in the sample.  These results prove \nto be much stronger for small than for large countries (where the coefficient on the \ncorruption variable is of the expected sign but insignificant). The unexpected result \ncomes when developing countries are split into large East Asia NIEs (covering China, \nIndonesia, Korea, Thailand and Japan) and other developing countries. Now whilst \ncorruption as expected has a negative growth effect in the majority of countries, in the \nEast Asian group, controlling for other factors, higher levels of corruption are strongly \nassociated with higher economic growth. Hence corruption seems bad for growth, except \nparadoxically in most of the fast growing economies of recent years.15\n \n This analysis \nrevives the idea of the East Asian developmental state where corrupt practices and \ninformal payments coexisted with positive developmental interventions by governments. \nThere is a vast literature on the transferability of this experience to other countries and \npoints in time. Given the difficulties of transferring this experience to the present it is \ndifficult to use it as a justification for corruption.     \nThe growth impact of the political aspects of governance is much less clear. Relatively \nfast growing DMCs have had both autocratic systems (China), well established \ndemocracies (India) and unstable democracies (Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh). From \ncross-country studies of the democracy-growth link the prevailing consensus is that there \nis little direct relationship. However qualifications to the lack of relationship have been \n                                                 \n14 World Bank (2006b) chapter 7 has a comprehensive survey of the empirical and theoretical literature on \ncorruption with a focus on East Asia. \n15 There is an extensive theoretical literature that addresses the theory of corruption; for example Schleifer \nand Vishny (1993 stress that a centralized \u2018hard state\u2019 can set predictable channels for corruption and act as \na single monopolist channelling bribes through to the centre. This is in contrast with a weak state where \nnumerous officials extract bribes in a decentralized and disorganized fashion and act as independent \ncompeting monopolists.  Indonesia under the Suharto regime and Korea under the Park regime are obvious \nexamples. In contrast the Philippines post- Marcos can be taken as a decentralized regime with weak and \nfragmented government where officials behave as competing monopolists. \nthat democracy may have a non-linear impact, helping growth at lower levels of \ndemocracy but harming it at higher levels (Barro 1996) and that democracy may be \nassociated with more stable growth even when on average there is no tendency for \ndemocracies to have higher growth than non-democracies (Rodrik 1999). Democracy \nmay also help reduce corruption through the mechanisms of political accountability and \npress freedom and there is some cross-country empirical evidence that democracy works \nto reduce corruption , but only with a very substantial time lag (something like 40 years) \n(World Bank 2006a: 284-284).  Arguably measures of democracy are even more \nuncertain than other aspects of governance and hence not too much weight can be placed \non these cross-country results.16\n \n Probably the most that can be said is that the view that \nthe once common view that a strong authoritarian regime is necessary to take difficult \ndecisions on issues of reform finds no support from this strand of the empirical literature. \nHowever the East Asian experience highlighted in the discussion of corruption above \ntends to contradict this finding for a small number of successful cases of strong \ngovernment intervention. \nAs is now widely recognized political systems more than any other aspects of governance \nneed to evolve internally rather than be imposed externally. However there is also the \nexpectation that improvements in governance, for example through less corruption in the \nadministration of targeting initiatives and greater local participation in poor area \ndevelopment programs will have a direct effect on poverty.  Some support for this view is \nprovided by project case-studies. World Bank (2004) for example discusses how \nparticipation by the poor affected through governance reforms can lead to better \noutcomes in terms of service delivery. Implementing such changes will be a challenge \nhowever, since even with adequate funding, without community support and the \nnecessary balance of incentives, the local response to the opportunities for participation \nmay be weak. Equally when decisions are left to local communities there is no automatic \nguarantee that the most needy will benefit.17\n \n Furthermore greater local participation is \nnormally closely linked with decentralization of political authority from central to local \ngovernment bodies, a process which has gone much further in some countries than in \nothers.  \nCross-country analyses of the governance-poverty links controlling for other influences \nare relatively rare. A recent study Henderson et al (2007) explores the link between \nbureaucratic effectiveness and income of the poor across countries. To capture this \nversion of governance they use not the Kaufmann et al index, but an index of \n\u2018Weberianness\u2019 designed to capture the meritocratic and independent nature of the state \n                                                 \n16 The studies referred to here use the Freedom House index.   \n17 Balisacan and Edillon (2005) discuss the participatory programs introduced in the Philippines in the \n1990\u2019s.the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) program was the flagship of \nthe Ramos administration\u2019s efforts at poverty reduction. An official review found it to be a success, but a \nmore rigorous independent evaluation found no evidence that change in the targeted areas was statistically \ndifferent from that elsewhere. In a village level study from India Srivastava (2006) shows that the definition \nof the most needy by villagers themselves can differ substantially from those identified by reference to an \nincome poverty line. \nbureaucracy across countries.18 The authors use this index in an otherwise standard \nregression model to explain income of the poor (defined as the mean income of the \nbottom quintile). The index of bureaucratic quality is positively relatively to the income \nof the poor controlling for other factors and is statistically significant (but only weakly \nso). This is suggestive evidence that the quality of public bureaucracy is a factor in \nexplaining the effectiveness of poverty reduction activities.19\n \n  \nIs there a blueprint for a governance model?  \n \nSimplistic versions of governance reform are sometimes equated with the transplanting of \nthe Anglo-American model of developed country structures to lower income \nenvironments. However, the effectiveness of this governance model has been challenged \nstrongly. Rodrik, in a series of influential papers has argued that the empirical evidence \non the importance of institutions for growth, that he and others have generated, is an \nempty box as far as precise policies are concerned since \u201cinstitutional outcomes do not \nmap into unique institutional designs \u2026 what works will depend on local constraints and \nopportunities\u201d (Rodrik 2004:9).  \n \nThe argument is that advanced capitalism has developed based on differing institutional \narrangements in Japan, the UK, continental Europe and the US and that country \nexperimentation based on local situations has been critically important. Hence for \nexample while protection of property rights may be critical for the investment climate \nand growth this can be achieved in a variety of ways. Recent experience in East Asia is \nalluded to with Korea in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s and China in the reform period cited as \nillustrations of how successful institutional change can evolve gradually in the face of \nlocal constraints. Further it is suggested that comprehensive governance reform is rarely \nrequired to set off growth and that modest piecemeal institutional improvements may be \nadequate to stimulate a growth spurt that later becomes self-sustaining. \n \nIn the Introduction to a series of country case studies of institutions and growth Rodrik \n(2003:17) sets out the central lesson. \u201cThe onset of economic growth does not require \ndeep and extensive institutional reform. This is perhaps one of the most important (and \nencouraging) lessons to emerge from the country narratives.  It is also a lesson that is \nsharply at variance with conventional wisdom on institutional reform which holds that the \ncomplementary nature of institutional reforms requires a long list of such reforms to be \npursued simultaneously.\u201d  \n \n                                                 \n18 This index was developed by Evans and Rauch (1999) on the basis of questionnaire responses from \nexpert commentators in 35 countries. It is meant to reflect the degree to which state agencies in the \ncountries covered were characterized by meritocratic recruitment and long-term career prospects. The \nhypothesis is that meritocratic bureaucracies are less likely to be prone to corruption and will be driven by \nan \u2018esprit de corps\u2019 to act independently of vested interests.  \n19 The authors probably overstate the conclusions in arguing \u201cthe balance of presumption must be that \nbureaucratic effectiveness of public institutions, in a given country, is likely to be decisive for that \ncountry\u2019s ability to reduce poverty.\u201d This may well be the case but the nature of the index and its weak \nsignificance (at the 10% level) suggest that simply their prior presumption is being confirmed. \nFor example, change in India in the 1980\u2019s in terms of a more positive climate for private \ninvestors is cited as having a key role in stimulating an improved growth rate prior to the \nmain reforms of the early 1990\u2019s.20\n \n Further recent work along these lines that stresses the \ncontext-specific element of governance reform includes Grindle (2007) and Meisel and \nAoudia (2008). If this view of institutional reform is correct it suggests plenty of scope \nfor country level discussions between governments and donors on ways of introducing \nmodest but positive change. \n  \nConclusions \n \nThe Aid paradigm set out at the outset aims to be flexible and adaptable to allow \npriorities for projects and programs to be determined at the country level. This flexibility \nis critical since whilst the chain of reasoning underlying figure 1 is broadly confirmed by \nthe evidence nothing is inevitable and impacts will vary with circumstances. \n \nAs has been confirmed many times poverty responds to economic growth although the \nstrength of the response varies between countries and the type of growth and what \nhappens to inequality matter for the speed of poverty reduction. Social improvements do \nnot inevitably follow with growth although broadly there is an association between \nincome levels and measures of welfare. Direct narrowly targeted interventions have a \nfairly poor track record in terms of targeting efficiency and even broader social \nexpenditure need not be associated with progress on social indicators. The strong \nimplication is that policy and programme design is critical. \n \nIn recent years there has been a revival of interest in physical infrastructure activity \namongst donors and there is strong evidence that this type of investment is critical for \nsustained growth. Donors have also tried to link infrastructure projects with direct \npoverty impacts. Here the evidence is more nuanced and it is clear that in terms of direct \npoverty effects it matters greatly what type and location of infrastructure is involved, \nwith certain types having strong poverty-reducing effects in some circumstances. \n \nGood governance is sometimes discussed as if it were a simple panacea for development \nproblems. Governance is a multi-dimensional concept that it is tricky to measure in \ncross-country comparisons. There is evidence linking some governance indicators with \neconomic growth, but equally it seems the case that not all governance reform is critical \neither for growth or poverty-reduction. Further it is likely that simple blue-prints will \nnot work and that country experimentation in governance improvements will be \nimportant. \n \nThese conclusions may remove some of the certainty from donor discussions of policy \nchange but that presumably should be welcomed. \n \n                                                 \n20 \u201cUnder Rajiv Gandhi, the government made some tentative moves to encourage capital goods imports, \nrelax industrial regulations and rationalize the tax system. The consequence was an economic boom \nincommensurate with the modesty of the reforms\u201d (Rodrik 2003: 19). \nReferences \n \nAcemoglu, D.
