This \nwidespread endorsement of risk-based regulation, together with the experience of regulatory failure, prompts us \nto consider how risk-based regulators can attune the logics of risk analyses to the complex problems and the \ndynamics of regulation in practice. We argue first, that regulators have to regulate in a way that is responsive \nto five elements: regulated firms\u2019 behaviour, attitude and culture; regulation\u2019s institutional environments; \ninteractions of regulatory controls; regulatory performance; and change. Secondly, we argue that the challenges of \nregulation to which regulators have to respond vary across the different regulatory tasks of detection, response \ndevelopment, enforcement, assessment and modification.  Using the really responsive\u2019 framework we highlight \nsome of the strengths and limitations of using risk based regulation to manage risk and uncertainty within the \nconstraints that flow from practical  and indeed from the framework of risk based regulation itself. The need \nfor a revised, more nuanced conception of risk-based regulation is stressed. \n \nIntroduction \n \nRegulators usually find that they have more do to, and more issues to respond to, \nthan time or resources allow.  Partly as a result, many governments and regulators are now \ndeveloping risk-based regulatory strategies as frameworks for the management of their \nresources, and their reputations (Rothstein et al 2006; Black 2005).    These are collections of \nstrategies that at the very least involve the targeting of enforcement resources on the basis of \nassessments of the risks that a regulated person or firm poses to the regulator\u2019s objectives.1 \nThe key components of such assessments are evaluations of the risks of non-compliance and \ncalculations regarding the impact that the non-compliance will have on the regulatory body\u2019s \nability to achieve its objectives. In its idealised form, risk-based regulation offers an evidence-\nbased means of targeting the use of resources and of prioritising attention to the highest risks \nin accordance with a transparent, systematic and defensible framework.  \n The UK is a jurisdiction that has fully embraced risk-based regulation, at least at the \nlevel of exhortation. The Hampton Review of 2005 (Hampton 2005) endorsed the risk based \nframeworks developed by the Environment Agency, Food Standards Agency, Health and \nSafety Executive and the UK Financial Services Authority and recommended that all \nregulatory agencies should adopt a risk-based approach to enforcement.  The Government \nhas sought to implement that recommendation across UK regulatory affairs, and all UK \nregulators are now under a statutory duty to develop and use risk based frameworks for \norganising all aspects of their regulatory activities, including data collection, inspection, advice \nand support programmes and enforcement and sanctions (Statutory Code of Practice for  \nRegulators 2007: section 4).    The UK is not alone in this move, and regulators have been \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 2 \ndeveloping risk-based frameworks of supervision in a wide range of countries, particularly in \nthe areas of environment, food safety, occupational health and safety, financial services and \npensions regulation (Black 2008).   \n This widespread endorsement of risk-based regulation prompts us to consider how \nrisk-based regulators can attune the logics of risk analyses to the complex problems and the \ndynamics of real-life regulatory scenarios. Elsewhere we have argued that such attuning \nrequires regulators to be \u2018really responsive\u2019 to the ongoing challenges that confront regulators \non a daily basis (Baldwin and Black 2008). We, accordingly, look here at the fit between \u2018risk-\nbased\u2019 and \u2018really responsive\u2019 regulation. By \u2018really responsive\u2019 regulation we mean a strategy \nof applying a variety of regulatory instruments in a manner that is flexible and sensitive to a \nseries of key factors. These include, not merely, the behaviour, attitude and culture of the \nregulated firm or individual but also the institutional environments in which regulation takes \nplace; the ways in which different control instruments interact; the performance of the \ncontrol regime itself; and the changes that occur in regulatory priorities, challenges and \nobjectives (Baldwin and Black 2008). \nA further prompting to re-examine the implementation challenges of risk-based \nregulation comes in the wake of the 2007-9 credit crisis and stems from the widespread \nperception that risk-based regulation, at least in the UK, signally failed to protect consumers \nand the public from the catastrophic failure of the banking system.2 This decline in the \nreputation of the UK\u2019s risk-based approach to financial regulation, together with the \nexperiences of other regulators who have adopted risk based approaches, presses us to \nexamine whether there is a need to apply risk-based regulation in a newly reflective manner \nand to conceive of it in a more nuanced way. We will argue that a \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach \noffers a framework for re-conceiving risk-based regulation in such a fashion. \nThis article contends that there are considerable difficulties to be faced in seeking to \napply risk-based regulation really responsively but that the payoffs from doing so outweigh \nany such difficulties. One payoff, it will be seen, is that the \u2018really responsive\u2019 framework \nforces us to move away from the rather too easy vision of risk-based regulation  - as a \nmechanical\/quantitative means of  solving regulatory problems, as envisaged by the \nHampton Report, for example (Hampton Report 2005: Recommendation 1).  It thrusts us \ntowards a more complex vision of risk-based regulation - as a particular entry point into, and \nmeans of constructing and addressing a core set of regulatory issues. It also compels us to see \nrisk-based regulation not as a free-standing and discrete mode of control but as a strategy that \nis routinely and often necessarily deployed in harness with a host of other strategies for \naddressing the challenges of regulatory intervention.  \nA really responsive analysis also suggests that, once regulators have established their \nobjectives, they should consider how any given regulatory approach comes to grips with the \nfive fundamental tasks that are involved in implementing regulation so as to further those \nobjectives. The tasks are: detecting undesirable or non-compliant behaviour, responding to \nthat behaviour by developing tools and strategies, enforcing those tools and strategies on the \nground, assessing their success or failure and modifying approaches accordingly (Baldwin \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 3 \nand Black 2008, 2005). Part of our argument here is that risk-based regulation should be used \nin a way that takes on board not only the way that risk-based approaches offer a distinctive \napproach to discharging each of these tasks (with the strengths and weaknesses of that \napproach) but also the ways that risk-based and other regulatory strategies are likely to \ninteract in different ways across the various tasks. \n \n \nThe key elements of risk-based regulation  \n The development of risk-based frameworks follows the pattern of many \ninnovations (Black 2005).  There have been a few \u2018early adopters\u2019 and over recent years the \nnumber of regulators adopting some kind of risk-based approach has steadily increased. The \nlater adopters have been directly or indirectly helped by the early exponents. Regulators have \ncommunicated the detail of their frameworks and their experiences to other regulators \nthrough trans-national networks, such as IMPEL3 in the environmental context, or by \nbilateral interchanges (Black 2006). Models of risk-based systems are thus spread across \nregulators and modified each time. For example the risk-based model of the Australian \nPrudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was based on that of the Canadian banking \nregulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and the UK \nfinancial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  It has in turn been adopted in \nmodified form in a number of different countries, including the Netherlands (for banks and \npensions) and Indonesia (for pensions).  The Canadian prudential supervision model also \nformed the basis for the Singaporean financial regulator\u2019s risk-based system. The UK\u2019s risk-\nbased model of financial regulation has been adopted in countries as diverse as France and \nColumbia.  Regulators often \u2018mix\u2019 models \u2013 so the Portuguese environment regulator, \nIGAOT4, used a mixture of the Irish Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s framework, with \nthat of the Dutch environmental regulator, VROM5. The Irish Environment Protection \nAgency\u2019s framework itself drew on that of the Environment Agency for England and Wales \nand its food hygiene framework draws on that of the Food Standards Agency\u2019s Code of \nPractice for England (Black 2008).  \n The frameworks vary considerably in their complexity. However all have a \ncommon starting point, which is a focus on risks not rules. Risk-based frameworks require \nregulators to begin by identifying the risks that they are seeking to manage, not the rules they \nhave to enforce. Regulators are usually over-burdened by rules. They cannot enforce every \none of these rules in every firm at every point in time. Selections have to be made. These \nselections have always been made, but risk-based frameworks both render the fact of \nselection explicit and provide a framework of analysis in which they can be made.   \n The frameworks themselves have five common core elements. First, they require a \ndetermination by the organisation of its objectives \u2013 of the risks \u2018to what\u2019 that it is concerned \n                                                 \n \n \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 4 \nwith.   Secondly, they require a determination of the regulator\u2019s own risk appetite \u2013 what type \nof risks is it prepared to tolerate and at what level. This can be an extremely challenging task \nfor a regulator. In practice, a regulator\u2019s risk tolerance is often ultimately driven by political \nconsiderations. All regulators face political risk, the risk that what they consider to be an \nacceptable level of risk will be higher than that tolerated by politicians, the media and the \npublic, and that the uncertainties that they face will be unrecognised and \/ or intolerated. \nPolitical risk is in practice a critical element in any risk-based system, as discussed below.  \n Second, risk-based frameworks involve an assessment of the hazard or adverse \nevent and the likelihood of it occurring. Terminology varies: food and environmental \nregulators tend to talk in terms of hazards and risks; financial regulators talk in terms of \nimpact and probability. But in general, two broad categories of risk are identified: the inherent \nrisks arising from the nature of the business\u2019s activities and in environmental regulation, its \nlocation; and management and control risks, including compliance record. The methods by which \nmanagement and control risks are combined with or offset against inherent risk scores varies \nbut, broadly speaking, the regulators are concerned with the effect of management and \ncontrols in either exacerbating the inherent risk or mitigating it. Although the terminology of \nrisk is used throughout, in practice, regulators will operate in quite differing conditions of \nuncertainty. In some scenarios there will be high numbers of incidents from which data on \ntheir probabilities of occurrence in different situations can be assessed but, in other \ncircumstances, the regulators will be dealing with low frequency events, from which reliable \nprobabilistic calculations cannot easily be drawn or with conditions of uncertainty, where the \nrisk is inherently insusceptible to probabilistic assessment.   \n Risk assessments may be highly quantitative (as in environmental regulation) or \nmainly qualitative (as in food safety regulation in the UK, or financial supervision more \ngenerally). Quantitative assessments involve less individual judgement and in environmental \nregulation are often performed by the firm themselves (as in England and Ireland) or can be \ncontracted out by the regulator to a third party (as in Portugal).  Qualitative assessments allow \nfor more flexibility and judgement, but critically rely on the skill and experience of regulatory \nofficials who are making the subjective judgements.   Third, regulators assign scores \nand\/or ranks to firms or activities on the basis of these assessments. These scores may be \nbroadly framed into three categories or traffic lights (\u2018high\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019) or there may \nbe a more granular scoring system, with five or more categories (the UK Financial Services \nAuthority has fifteen different categories, for example).  Where numerical scores are used, \nthese will often operate as shorthand for more complex underlying judgements and they may \nconceal hesitancies and qualifications in the confident exposition of the number itself. (The \nexpression of subjective judgements in numerate form can also lead observers to misconstrue \nall risk based systems as purely quantitative, whereas in practice their character can vary quite \nconsiderably between regulators.) For the most part, assessors do not indicate whether they \nthink the risk score is likely to increase or decrease over time - though one notable exception \nis the Canadian banking regulator, OSFI, which requires its supervisors to indicate the \n\u2018direction of travel\u2019 of the risk, and the time period over which they think this will occur.   \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 5 \n Fourth, risk-based frameworks provide a means of linking the organisation and of \nsupervisory, inspection and often enforcement resources to the risk scores assigned to \nindividual firms or system-wide issues. In practice, resources do not always follow the risks in \nthe way that the framework would suggest, but resource allocation remains a key rationale for \ntheir development.   \n Despite these common elements, no two risk-based systems are identical in their \nform and they often differ significantly in their operation - even if they happen to have \ncertain similarities in form. Some of these formal and operational differences stem from the \nregulators\u2019 often widely differing remits and their locations within the institutional structures \nof their governments. But differences also reflect strategic choices and, as such, can be \nrevealing. Risk-based frameworks are not neutral, technical instruments. Each aspect of a \nrisk-based framework involves a complex set of choices. They require decisions by the \nregulator regarding such matters as: the risks it will identify as requiring attention; the \nindicators and methods it will use to assess those risks; where it will prioritise its attention, \nand where it will not, and, ultimately, of political risk: what level of risk or failure the \nregulator is prepared to accept - or at least thinks it can withstand. \n \nThe Elements of a Really Responsive Approach to Risk-Based Regulation \n \nThe \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach, to recap, carries two main messages. The first of \nthese is that, in designing, applying and developing regulatory systems, regulators should be \nattentive and responsive to five key factors: the behaviour, attitudes and cultures of regulatory \nactors; the institutional setting of the regulatory regime; the different logics of regulatory tools and \nstrategies (and how these interact); the regime\u2019s own performance over time; and finally, changes in each \nof these elements.  \nThese five factors are chosen because they encapsulate the central challenges that \nregulators face and which must be risen to if they are to achieve their objectives over time. \nThe behaviour, attitudes and cultures of regulatory actors are considerations that require \nresponsiveness because the motivational postures, conceptions of interests and cognitive \nframeworks of regulated firms (and regulators) heavily influence the regulatory relationship \nand the regulator\u2019s capacity to influence regulate behaviour (Oliver 1991).  The institutional \nsetting of the regulatory regime has to be taken into account because the position that each \norganization (regulator or regulatee) occupies with regard to other institutions can have a \ncritical effect on the actual and potential operation of regulation. The actions of a regulatory \nagency, for instance, are strongly shaped by the distribution of resources, powers and \nresponsibilities between that body and other organizations, including those who oversee it \n(Scott 1995; Powell and DiMaggio 1991).    \n The interactions of different regulatory tools and strategies have also to be responded \nto because they impact pivotally on regulatory performance. Most regulators use a wide \nvariety of control tools and strategies but these often have divergent logics \u2013 they embody \ndifferent regulator to regulatee relationships and assume different ways of interacting. Thus, \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 6 \ncommand and sanction-based instruments operate on very different understandings to \neducative or economic incentive systems of control. There may be harmony or dissonance \nbetween these tools and strategies \u2013 so that, for instance, applying sanctions on a deterrent \nbasis may undermine a concurrent strategy of \u2018educate and persuade\u2019 by killing regulator to \nregulate communications. It is, accordingly, essential for the really responsive regulator to \nmanage tool and strategy interactions (Gunningham and Grabosky 1998; Black 1997).  . \nBeing sensitive and responsive to the regime\u2019s performance is also of crucial \nimportance to any regulator. If regulators cannot assess the performance of their regimes, \nthey cannot know whether their efforts (and budgets) are having any positive effect in \nfurthering their objectives. Nor can they justify their operations to the outside world. If they \ncannot modify and adapt their operations and strategies in the light of performance \nassessments, they will be saddled with poor delivery and incapable of dealing with the new \nchallenges that all regulators are confronted by. \nFinally, the \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach holds that sensitivity to change lies at the \nheart of acceptable regulatory performance. In virtually all sectors, regulatory challenges are \nin a state of constant shift. Thus, for instance, new risks and risk creators emerge or are \nrecognized, and uncertainties can harden into risks, for example as events occur, knowledge \ndevelops, technologies and markets change, institutional structures are reformed, political \nand legal obligations alter, and public expectations and preferences mutate. If regulators \ncannot adapt to change, they will apply yesterday\u2019s controls to today\u2019s problems and, again, \nunder-performance will be inevitable. \nAs for the exhaustiveness of the five key factors of the \u2018really responsive\u2019 \napproach, it can be argued that regulators who attend to the above matters will have cause to \ncome to grips with all of the main challenges that are identified by the prevailing theories of \nregulatory development. Regulators are thus called on to take on board: the importance of \ndivergent interests (be these public, private\/economic or group); the significance of \nvariations in cultures, values, ideas, communications regimes and control systems; and the \nimpact of intra- and inter-institutional forces (Baldwin and Cave 1999; Morgan and Yeung \n2007). They will also be sensitive to the ways in which regulatory challenges and interactions \nvary across regulatory issues and tasks \u2013 as is the message of \u2018regulatory space\u2019 theory \n(Hancher and Moran 1989). \n The second message of \u2018really responsive regulation\u2019 is, as noted, that regulatory \ndesigns, developments and operations should take on board the way that regulatory \nchallenges vary across the core tasks that regulators have to carry out, both with respect to \nindividual firms and in developing strategies more generally \u2013 namely: detecting undesirable \nor non-compliant behaviour, responding to that behaviour by developing tools and \nstrategies, enforcing those tools and strategies on the ground, assessing their success or \nfailure and modifying them accordingly.  These tasks of implementation are central to any \nregulatory strategy.  In emphasizing them, we do not  suggest that the logically prior task of \ndetermining objectives is straightforward or irrelevant, nor, indeed,  that in practice the task \nof identifying objectives is wholly  separable from issues of implementation: regulators like \nother decision makers can in practice define their objectives with reference to what  they \nthink they can achieve rather than (or as well as) what  they would hope to achieve in an \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 7 \nideal world of infinite resources and no institutional constraints.  Further, we recognize that \nfew organizations have complete freedom of action and that, in introducing new strategies, \nthe organisation\u2019s embeddedness has to be recognised and taken on board, both by the \norganization itself and by prescribers of those strategies, be they academics or politicians.  \nHere, the case for focusing on and looking \u2018across tasks\u2019 is that there is good evidence that \nthe work to be done to achieve real responsiveness will vary significantly from task to task \nand that it would be a mistake to think that a strategy that works in relation to, say, the \ndetection of non-compliers will prove as effective in relation to the securing of compliance \nor the assessing of performance (Baldwin and Black 2008). \nThe special challenges of applying a risk-based regime in a \u2018really responsive\u2019 \nmanner should now be considered. \n \ni) Responsiveness to the  behaviour, attitude and culture  of firms \n \nRegulators generally need to take on board the organisational capacity, past behaviour \nand attitude of the regulated firm if they are to achieve their mandated objectives. For risk-\nbased regulators, such factors will routinely be considered by making reference to risk scoring \nformulae when targeting regulatory interventions at the highest risk creators.  These formulae \nare often only loosely based around the common risk model that risk equals probability times \nimpact. Impact analyses advert to the quantum of the adverse impact that the firm\u2019s \nbehaviour might have on the achievement of regulatory objectives \u2013 they will look, for \ninstance, to the size of the potential environmental, food safety or financial harms that might \nbe caused by the particular firm\u2019s type of operations. They can also refer to the nature of the \nharm to be suffered: for example the Office of Fair Trading ranks the impact of home debt \ncollection as high because of the nature of the harm that can be caused by abusive practices, \nrather than because of their systemic impact.  Probability calculations will look to the chances \nthat the firm will cause such a harm to occur. Such calculations, are often based, inter alia, on \nthe past and current behaviour of regulated firms or individuals. Thus, poor compliance \nhistories and underperforming risk control systems are often reflected in high risk scores.  \n   Risk-scoring accordingly appears highly compatible with the really responsive \napproach and its demanded advertence to the capacities, cultures and understandings that \noperate within regulated organisations. The quality and character of management and their \nrisk controls is often a key mitigator or exacerbator of inherent risks and there is, on the face \nof it, no reason why probability calculations cannot take on board motivational postures as \nreflected in such factors as commitment to or accommodation of the regulatory agenda (i.e. \nthe firm\u2019s degree of acceptance that it has to change its behaviour to suit some wider public \npolicy goal); amenability to supervision\/capitulation to the regulatory authority; resistance, \ngame playing and disengagement (e.g. FSA 2006; Oliver 1991).   \n Certain challenges do, however, arise when it is sought to incorporate behavioural \nand cultural matters into risk-based assessments. A first of these flows from a key difference \nbetween risk-based assessments and compliance-based assessments. Risk-based assessments \nare, at their heart, forward-looking. They attempt to assess the risks of the firm on a dynamic, \non-going and future basis rather than seek to capture the state of the firm at the particular \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 8 \npoint in time when the inspection or supervision visit occurs. Different types of risk-based \nsystems are better equipped to do this than others.  The system used by environmental \nregulators, for example, focuses only on past compliance records, assigning scores on the \nbasis of past infractions, or whether a particular management system is in place. More \nsubjectively- based systems are intended to incorporate a more responsive and dynamic \nassessment. Thus, in October 2009 Hector Sants, Chief Executive of the FSA looked back at \nthe credit crisis and stated: \u2018The key lesson learnt is that the FSA must be proactive and not \nreactive to the management of risk. This is primarily a matter of judgement.\u2019 (Masters 2009) \n     Such prospective subjectivity can be viewed as a strength of risk-based regulation but it \ncan present difficulties. Discretionary decision-making has to be incorporated within a risk \nregime in a manner that ensures consistency across evaluators and this can present managerial \nproblems for regulators. For many regulators it is hard  to strike the right balance between \nensuring that staff apply a healthy level of sophisticated and informed qualitative judgement in \ntheir risk assessments and controlling those judgements for the sake of consistency. Further \ndangers are that the processes of overseeing discretionary decision-making can prove \nexcessively costly in staff time and resources and that centrally-administered controls, checks \nand structuring procedures can render the agency slow to respond to changes in the \nregulatory challenges that they face. \n      The Hampton Report recommended that risk based approaches should not be used just \nfor assessing the risks that firms pose to the regulators\u2019 objectives but across all regulatory \ntasks (Hampton Report 2005).   Two central difficulties have to be faced, however,  in using \nrisk scoring as an organisationally-sensitive guide to the execution of all regulatory tasks.  \nFirst, the \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach reminds us that regulators and firms can interact quite \ndifferently across the various tasks of regulation and that assessments of cultures and attitudes \nmay vary within firms and across tasks.  Some parts of a firm may be more amenable to \nregulatory intervention than others.  Further, even where the firm\u2019s response is not internally \nfragmented, a firm may prove to be highly resistant and uncooperative in relation to the \nregulator\u2019s detection work but it may be very compliant once its behaviour is placed at issue \n(e.g. it is secretive and defiant on disclosure but \u2018comes quietly\u2019 when is errant ways are \ndiscovered). The challenge here is to develop risk analyses that are sufficiently fine-grained to \naccommodate such variations rather than to settle for using  a crude across the board mode of \nevaluation.  \nThe second complication that arises is a more general difficulty in using risk \nanalyses to guide all regulatory operations. It is that such analyses may prove far more helpful \nin relation to some tasks than others and it cannot be assumed that they will provide \nconsistent messages with regard to different tasks. Thus, risk scoring may provide a very ready \nbasis for detecting  high risk actors, but it may offer far less assistance in identifying the \nmodes of intervention that are best attuned to securing compliance. A firm may, for instance, \nbe given a high risk score because of the inherent risks it poses and because its management\u2019s \nslack attitudes are reflected in a failure to manage risks well. This risk score may indicate the \ndegree of urgency with which some regulatory intervention has to be made but the firm\u2019s high \nrisk score does not indicate, in itself, whether the best way to reduce the risks posed by the \nfirm is to use a command and control regime applied in, say, a deterrence fashion or whether \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 9 \nan incentive-based, educative, escalating sanctions or disclosure strategy would prove more \neffective. The kind of intervention required, may at best be loosely linked to the level of risk \nthat the firm presents.  \nThe major determinant of the optimal style of intervention is liable to be revealed \nby an analysis of the likely responsiveness of the firm to different stimuli \u2013 and this may \ninvolve a departure from an overly-rigid risk-based system and a drawing on other theories, \nsuch as \u2018compliance\u2019, \u2018deterrence\u2019, responsive regulation, problem-centred and other \napproaches to fit the context (see generally Baldwin and Cave 1999: Chapter 8).  Two firms \nwith similarly high risk scores may, for instance, be respectively well-intentioned and ill-\ninformed or ill-intentioned and ill-informed. The former may respond well to an educative \nprogramme and the latter is unlikely to. The former does not need to be met with a punitive \nthreat, the latter may have to be. How best to deal with these two firms is not readily \nidentified by reference to a risk assessment system.  \n     In practice, regulators vary in the extent to which their risk-based assessment systems are \nlinked to a particular policy of intervention.  Some, such as Australia\u2019s APRA or Canada\u2019s \nOSFI, have a close link.  An assessment that a firm poses a high risk to the regulators\u2019 \nobjectives will mean that a particular intervention policy is adopted.  More frequently, \nhowever, regulators have no particular link between the assessment and the nature of \nintervention or enforcement policies to be adopted.   \nAnother difficulty arises if the same risk-assessments are used as guides to the \nexecution of different regulatory tasks. Risk assessments may offer very ready bases for \nidentifying high risk actors but they will only serve to establish the foremost priorities for the \napplication of enforcement resources if risk-based regulation is used simply to attack the \nhighest risks \u2013 rather than to maximise the furtherance of statutory objectives.6 This point is \nmade by contrasting two hypothetical companies: Millco and Scatterco. Millco presents, let us \nsay, 80 units of risk but it is cheap to regulate because its managers are well organised and \namenable to instruction and it occupies one site. The risks it presents can be reduced to 20 \nunits by the application of \u00a35000 of enforcement resource. Scatterco presents 90 units of risk \nbut it is expensive to regulate because its managers are disorganised and not amenable to \ninstruction and it occupies a large number of sites. The risks Scatterco presents can be \nreduced to 70 units by the application of \u00a35000 of enforcement resource. The given resource \nof \u00a35000 buys a risk reduction of 60 units in the case of Millco but 20 units for Scatterco. \nHow should regulatory resources be applied to Millco and Scatterco? The example \nshows that simply targeting intervention at the highest risk presenter is a very inefficient way \nof reducing potential harms and that it is not possible to use risk scoring as a driver of action \nwithout misapplication of resource. What is arguably needed for a really responsive risk-based \nregime is a linking of the risk scoring system to an \u2018amenability analysis\u2019 that looks at the \nattitude, nature and organisation of the firm as this relates to: a) the mode of intervention \nlikely to prove most efficient in furthering statutory objectives and b) the anticipated benefits \nyielded per unit of regulatory expenditure. \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 10 \nA central issue here is whether a risk-based regulator should be responsive to \nattitudinal and cultural matters by taking levels of amenability on board  when risk scoring for \nthe purposes of identifying targets for intervention. There are alternative approaches. If it is \nthought advisable to separate the identification of highest risks from issues of enforceability, \nthen amenability - or its absence \u2013 could be treated as a risk to the agency\u2019s achieving its \nstatutory objectives \u2013 but as a different  kind of risk to the primary risk that is subject to risk \nscoring for the purposes of targeting. Thus, \u2018primary risk\u2019 would be the risk that, say, \nScatterco presents to the agency\u2019s objective to protect air quality \u2013 it would be scored in the \nnormal way by looking at the quantum of inherent risk and the likelihood of a harm\u2019s \noccurring \u2013 as mitigated by the firm\u2019s risk management regime. The secondary risk would be \nthe risk that the regulated concern\u2019s behaviour cannot be modified in a manner that renders \nthe primary risk acceptable. Another approach to these challenges would be to treat \namenability, again, as separate from \u2018primary risk\u2019 but to treat  amenability deficiencies not as \na secondary risks but as  challenges (to modify behaviour so as to render primary risk \nacceptable) that are seen in terms other than risk \u2013 as, for example,  issues of political or \npolicy judgement. \nFor the purposes of this article we are agnostic on whether amenability issues should \nbe seen as secondary risks or as policy challenges.7 On, however, the case for dealing with \nprimary risk in a way that separates it from secondary risk (or \u2018amenability challenges\u2019) this \ncan be evaluated by considering the argument for incorporating the assessment of \nsecondary\/amenability risk into the primary risk scoring system.  \nWhat can be restated here is that most existing risk based scoring systems do take on \nboard the quality of the firm\u2019s risk management system \u2013 at least where corporate \narrangements are sufficiently stable to allow evaluation. The weight that is attached to such \nmanagerial assessments within risk scoring does, however, vary across regulators and the \ndesigns of their particular risk-based systems. The England and Wales Environment Agency\u2019s \nframework gives such assessments relatively little weight, but the Portuguese environmental \nregulator\u2019s scheme applies a multiplier of three to the \u2018management and control\u2019 score as it \nwants to incentivise firms to improve their risk- management systems and thus lower their \nrisk scores. Management and control assessments also have a significant impact in the risk \nscoring systems of many financial regulators since these can lower or raise the \u2018net risk\u2019 of the \nfirm.  Whatever weighting is given to \u2018management and control\u2019 within a given regime, \nhowever, the general practice is to lower the risk score overall where the regulator has \nconfidence in the management team\u2019s ability to control relevant risks.   \nAssessments of firms\u2019 abilities to manage their risks are not, however, the same as \nevaluations of their amenability \u2013 their likely responsiveness to regulators\u2019 interventions. \nSome firms, for instance, may be competent and serious risk managers but highly resistant to \n\u2018interference\u2019 from regulators. Scoring systems can, nevertheless, be developed to incorporate \nsuch amenability assessments. The Portuguese environmental regulator, IGOAT, for example \nincludes in its assessment of management and control an assessment of the firms\u2019 interaction \nwith the regulators and uses this as an indicator for the firm\u2019s amenability to intervention \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 11 \n(Black 2008).  In the absence of such a focused assessment, however, it is dangerous to treat \nan evaluation of the firms\u2019 ability to manage its risks, or its attitude to risk management, as an \nindicator of amenability. \nWhere amenability assessments are undertaken, there is a strong argument for \nseparating the assessment of amenability from risk assessment.  If amenability is included in \nthe overall risk score, this will conflate the risk that the firm presents with the ease with \nwhich its behaviour can be influenced.  If amenability is assessed separately, regulators can \nchoose whether to prioritise high or low amenability firms for intervention. That choice \nwould be masked if the amenability assessment was bundled in with the primary risk score \nand an important policy dilemma would be side-stepped.  Thus, if firms with low amenability \nwere given a high risk score because of their lack of amenability, this would establish an \ninverse relationship between priorities for intervention and those areas where risk reductions \ncould be achieved at lowest cost.  It would  increase the intervention priority given to those \nfirms that would be the most difficult and expensive to bring into compliance.  If, \nalternatively, firms with low amenability were given a low risk score because of their lack of \namenability (de-prioritising firms who were unresponsive to influence) this could incentivise \nresistance to regulation and would reduce the intervention priority given to firms who might \notherwise score as high risk.  Separating the amenability analysis from the overall risk score \nthus avoids a problematic conflation and brings two advantages. First, it allows opportunities \nfor lower cost risk reductions to be identified and, second, it enables  regulators to make clear \ndecisions on the balance that they want to set between targeting resources at the highest risks \nand focussing attention on lowest cost risk reductions and efficiency of resource use. This \nlatter clarity of decision-making will be important in many contexts because the optimal \nbalance between \u2018highest risk\u2019 and \u2018highest risk reduction\u2019 targeting will vary from risk to risk \nand may be affected by such matters as the regulatory objectives and the political constraints \nwithin which a given set of intervention activities takes place. Striking that balance may, \nmoreover, involve political contention. \nSimilar arguments can be made for keeping the risk scoring of \u2018primary risk\u2019 separate \nfrom the risks and challenges that flow from the matters to be discussed in the following \nsections \u2013 namely from the institutional environments of regimes; the interactions of \nregulatory controls; the needs to assess regulatory performance; and the difficulties of coping \nwith change. The discussion of this point will not accordingly be rehearsed in those sections. \nBefore concluding on the challenges of an amenability-sensitive approach to \nregulation, however, it should be noted that information on amenability will not always be \nreadily available. It is not, for instance, routinely possible for a regulator to calculate the \namount of risk reduction that an intervention strategy will in fact produce in a regulatee.  In \nthe Millco and Scatterco example it was assumed that the regulator can calculate the potential \nrisk reduction that will be achieved from a given regulatory effort. In practice, however, this \nwill not always be the case. Such a calculation might be made if the regulatory task involves a \nwell-known regulatee and a high number of similar instances of risk reduction (as might be \nthe case in relation to, say, certain occupational health and safety risks) but it is unlikely to be \npossible where the risk is one that is low frequency and idiosyncratic and where contacts with \nthe regulatee are infrequent. In such circumstances, where a regulator is dealing with low \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 12 \nfrequency events, or indeed with uncertainty rather than risk, it will be extremely hard to \npredict the risk reducing return from the regulatory input.  \nTo summarise, what the \u2018really responsive\u2019 framework suggests is, first, that risk \nscoring, in relation to any task, should take attitudinal matters on board, second, that attitudes \n(and their impacts on the risk framework) may vary across regulatory tasks and, third, that \nastute regulators will be clear about the degree to which any particular regulatory task can and \nshould be guided by a risk scoring system. Further messages are  that risk assessments relating \nto different regulatory tasks may be best kept separate and that risk-based regulation cannot \nstand alone. Its methods will often require supplementing by additional strategies and \njudgements since risk analyses offer little assistance in relation to many of the familiar \nproblems that regulators face \u2013 such as how best to secure compliance, or whether it is best \nto regulate in a precautionary or intervention-averse manner. Even on a relatively simple \nmatter such as the identification of the largest risks, risk-based regulation per se tells us only a \nlimited amount about the costs of securing risk reductions or whether objectives are best \nfurthered by targeting analyses at individual risk-creators or particular types of risk or \nparticular industrial sectors or certain systemic risks or some other focus.    All of this is not \nto say that risk-based regulation is inevitably misguided, it is to argue that, although it is often \nconceived of as a straightforward approach, it is a complex and nuanced strategy that is often \ndealing in situations of uncertainty rather than risk, although uncertainty is often unhelpfully \nobscured by the dominant language of risk, and which has to be used with the awareness of \nits limitations that a \u2018really responsive\u2019 viewpoint offers. \n \nii) Responsiveness to institutional environments \nA really responsive approach to risk-based regulation emphasises the degree to which \nregulatory interactions, processes or outcomes are shaped by the institutional environments \nof both regulatee and regulator. These environments are constituted by the \norganisational\/regulatory, normative, cognitive and resource-distribution structures in which \nthese actors are situated (Scott 1995; Powell and DiMaggio 1991). The actions and decisions \nof organisations and individuals (both regulators and regulatees) are thus structured by the \nnorms regulating their conduct, by the senses of appropriateness of actions, of \nunderstandings of how the environment operates and by the distribution of resources \nbetween themselves and others with whom they interact. For regulatees, this includes the \nmarket and in particular its value chain.  For both regulatee and regulator, it includes other \nregulators within a decentred or polycentric regulatory regime.  A really responsive approach, \naccordingly, demands the recognition that when regulators apply risk-based approaches, they \ntake into account the challenges and limitations imposed by institutional environments which \nare both internal and external to regulatory organisations and regulatees and which involve \nthese actors in active as well as passive roles. Two key lessons of the financial crisis, for \nexample, are that risk assessments need to move from their micro-level, firm specific analyses \nof risk in two ways.  They need to incorporate assessments of the impact of macro-economic \nfactors on financial institutions (the \u2018outside-in\u2019 assessment) and, further, that they need to \ncouple their micro-level, firm specific analyses of risk with an analysis of risks arising across \nthe financial system as a whole.  Part of this requires regulators to incorporate assessments of \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 13 \nthe impact of the financial institution itself on the rest of the financial system (\u2018inside-out\u2019 \nimpacts).  Evidence to date suggests that financial regulators are getting to grips with the \nformer more quickly than they are the latter. \n Focussing on regulatory organisations, the norms and cultures of these bodies are \ncritical to their operations. This presents special challenges for risk-based approaches that \nseek to incorporate qualitative, and thus subjective, judgements by regulatory officials into \ntheir risk scoring regimes.  The formal design of the risk-based assessment system can \nstructure that judgement but it cannot ensure that valid subjective judgements are made in \npractice.  As some of its longest standing practitioners emphasise, risk assessments are an art, \nnot a science.   Qualitative risk assessment systems, as noted above, place significant reliance \non the quality of regulators\u2019 judgements - which may not be sufficient to the task \u2013 and the \ncontrol of such judgements raises resource and responsiveness issues.  In addition, regulators, \nlike others making risk assessments, are prey to cognitive biases and to over-confidence, \nwhich will affect their perceptions and judgement.  This can have a significant impact on the \nassessment. Some regulators have found, for example, that their supervisors are particularly \npoor at assessing the quality of management and controls.  Back-testing of assessments \nreveals that they routinely over-estimate the quality of these controls, by a factor of about \n30%, suggesting greater attention needs to be paid to how supervisors\u2019 exercise their \njudgements in assessing risks (Black, 2008). \nThe broader institutional, including political context, is also critical to the \nperformance of a risk-based regime yet such regimes may experience special difficulties in \ndealing with these matters. To return to the example of the failures of the UK\u2019s financial \nservices regulatory regime in the period up to the credit crisis, it could be argued that at least \nsome of these can be put down to key aspects of the institutional environment within which \nthe regulators worked \u2013 notably the way that the UK Government\u2019s \u2018light touch\u2019 regulatory \nphilosophy shaped regulatory interactions and understandings about the appropriateness of \nregulatory demands; the degree to which domestic regulators placed faith in controls by other \nnational regulators to control globally interconnected markets (a reliance which was itself in \npart mandated by the EEA passporting system for financial institutions which placed \nresponsibility for supervision of overseas branches on home state regulators and whose \nlimitations were evidenced by the impact of the collapse of the Icelandic banks on UK \ndeposit holders); and the extent to which domestic regulators considered themselves \nconstrained by regulatory competition  within the international institutional environment \n(HM Treasury 2009; Turner 2009; Tett 2009).  \n      A further difficulty for risk-based regulators can arise when their powers are fragmented \nor shared. Thus, another factor that may have reduced the effectiveness of the UK\u2019s financial \nservices risk-based regulatory regime in the lead up to the credit crisis was the way in which \nregulatory powers were distributed  between the Treasury, Bank of England and the Financial \nServices Authority. This arrangement exemplifies the common position in which many risks \nand social or economic problems are controlled by networks of regulators rather than bodies \nenjoying the luxury of a regulatory monopoly \u2013 networks in which  regulation is \u2018decentred\u2019 \nrather than simple and focussed (Black 2001).  If attention is paid to institutional \nenvironments, the challenges of working within networks have to be taken on board. For \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 14 \nrisk-based regulators these challenges may prove considerable and it may be necessary to \ncope with: divergence between the various networked regulators\u2019 aims, objectives and \ninstitutional environments; variations in regulatory cultures; differences in capacities, skills \nand resources; and varying capacities to modify their operations (Bardach 1998; Sparrow \n2000; Kickert,  Klijn and Koppenjan 1997;  Sullivan and  Skelcher  2002; Chisholm 1989) . \n     If, furthermore, we look across the different tasks of regulation, we can see that \ninstitutional environments arguably impact on the discharging of all of these \u2013 and not \nnecessarily in the same ways. This is a further challenge for risk-based regulators. To stay with \nthe example of UK financial regulation prior to the credit crisis, the detection work of the \nUK financial regulators was arguably impeded by institutional understandings \u2013 for instance \nthat the credit ratings agencies, the banks and the markets could be relied upon to ensure that \nthe sale of collateralised debt obligations and other securitisations produced benign risk-\nspreading rather than a deep-seated systemic threat to financial confidence. It has also been \nargued that the institutional environment impeded detection work because it created an \nexpertise imbalance whereby the \u2018rocket scientists\u2019 in the investment banks were able to \ndevise bundled products and models to assess their own financial risks (and those of the \nproducts they were dealing in) that the regulators were ill-equipped to evaluate in depth (Tett  \n2009; US General Accounting Office 2009: 6; Haldane 2009; Gerding 2009) . \n Response development by UK financial service regulators \u2013 the devising of new \npowers and control tools \u2013 was constrained by governmental concerns that domestic \nregulators did not reduce the UK\u2019s regulatory competitiveness and lower the UK\u2019s position in \ntables of good places to do business. These concerns have legal expression.  The Financial \nServices Authority\u2019s legal mandate requires it to take into consideration \u2018the international \ncharacter of financial services and markets and the desirability of maintaining the competitive \nposition of the United Kingdom\u2019 (Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, s.2(3)(e)).  The \nUK government repeatedly lauded the UK\u2019s \u2018light touch\u2019 approach to regulation, which was \nportrayed as a key weapon in the battle for business between New York and London.  It is \nnotable that in their evidence to the Treasury Select Committee that both the chairman of the \nFSA and the Governor of the Bank of England emphasised the political and market hostility \nthat they would have faced in \u2018stopping the party\u2019 and requiring banks to rein in their \nactivities (Lord Turner\u2019s evidence in response to Q 2145 HC Treasury Select Committee 25 \nFeb 2009; Mervyn King\u2019s evidence in response to Q 2354 HC Treasury Select Committee 26 \nFeb 2009). \nAnother institutional constraint on response development within risk-based systems \ncan occur when risks spread across jurisdictions or levels of government so that new rules \nrequire  levels of institutional co-operation that are difficult to bring about. Thus, it is widely \naccepted by the G20 governments, including the UK Treasury,   that a key contributing cause \nof the credit crisis of 2007-9 was the failure of national regulators to respond in coordination \nwith other national regulators and supra-national regulators not only to the excessive risks \nbeing taken by some individual firms, but to the problems of global system \u2013 wide risk and \nthe aggregate effect of individual risk positions being taken by firms whose cumulative effect \nwas to exponentially increase fragility of system by developing global monitoring systems and \nregulatory structures  (H M Treasury, 2009: para. 3.1; G20  2009). \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 15 \nAgain with reference to UK financial regulation prior to the credit crisis, enforcement \nactivities were arguably muted by a political and governmental context that was \nunsympathetic to interventions other than those consistent with light touch regulation. \nAssessments of regulatory performance were hindered by the regulators\u2019 confidence that few \nsystemic risks flowed from securitisation because the market institutions were managing these \nand modifications of regulation were held back not only because of incomplete performance \nassessments but because the regulators knew the Government to have no appetite for more \nrigorous controls  (Lord Turner\u2019s evidence in response to Q 2145 HC Treasury Select \nCommittee 25 Feb 2009).  \nSome commentators may take issue with some of the above points about regulatory \ndeficiencies and the credit crisis but, for the purposes of the current discussion, the above \naccount serves to demonstrate the value of a really responsive approach as a means of \nrevealing the special challenges that a risk-based regime faces. Noteworthy among these are, \nfirst, the need to recognise that regulators are often not dealing with risk, but uncertainty (see \nalso Gray 2009)  Second, whether they are dealing with risk or uncertainty, there is a  frequent \nneed to depart from the promise of a technical solution to regulatory issues and to  \nincorporate qualitative judgements within analyses. Third, risk based regulatory frameworks \nare inevitably subject to \u2013 and, perhaps, especially vulnerable to -  moulding by their \ninstitutional and political environments.   \nOn this last point, particularly, the credit crisis revealed a critical aspect of the risk-\nbased regulator\u2019s institutional environment: its political licence to operate.  Others have noted \nthat firms need a \u2018social licence\u2019 to operate  (Gunningham, Kagan and Thornton (2004).  We \nsuggest that regulators need a political licence.  They need political support if they are to act \naggressively against firms, and not just in financial markets (although in financial markets they \nneed considerable support to act against \u2018bubbles\u2019 as well). Moreover, risk-based systems \nthemselves carry significant political risk for regulators. Risk-based regulation requires \nregulators to prioritise, and thus to decide to commit fewer resources to fulfilling its legal \nmandate with respect to some firms, or risks, than others.  The regulatory reality of selection \nclashes with the political, and civil, expectation of universal protection and the transparency \nof the selection process can render the regulator politically vulnerable. Transparency has a \ndownside as well as an upside and that downside comes especially to the fore in two kinds of \ncircumstance. First, particularly high political and reputational risk  are run when things go \nwrong in firms or areas of the market which the regulator has decided are low risk and thus \nto which it has given little attention. Second, in times of crisis risk-based regulators can find \nthat they lose their autonomy to set their own levels of risk-appetite. \n \niii) Responsiveness to the logics of control instruments \nAs noted above, risk-based regulation usually operates in combination with other \nstrategies. Really responsive risk-based regulation accommodates this reality by paying \nattention to the ways in which the logics of different regulatory strategies and tools can \ninteract (Gunningham and Grabosky 1998; Black 1997). Different regulatory strategies can \nhave different logics (e.g. of punishment or restoration or rehabilitation or \u2019professional\u2019 or \n\u2018commercial\u2019 logics). Particular logics involve distinctive relationships and modes of \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 16 \nconversing with regulated parties \u2013 a punitive message, for instance, will be framed and \nreceived differently from a rehabilitative message. They involve different understandings \nregarding the nature of behaviour or of an institutional environment, and in turn have \ndifferent preconditions for effectiveness. These are based on different assumptions, value \nsystems, cultures and founding ideas so that mixing logics involves distortions and failures of \ncontact. \nReally responsive risk-based regulation would thus ideally  seek, first, to identify the \nregulatory logics engaged in different regulatory tasks and, second, to deal with interactions of \nlogics \u2013 as these may combine and interplay in varying ways across the five core tasks of \nregulation.  Risk-based regulation also has its own logic which may be incompatible with \nother prevailing logics, as discussed below.  Thus, for the purposes of detection, regulators \nmight use a risk-scoring system to identify certain firms as high priority risks and might \ndeploy a number of further strategies in order to amass the information that they need to \ncollect in order to produce risk assessments (Black 2008). They might, for instance, use a \nmixture of training and educational measures, co-operative discussions, advisory notes, \neconomic incentives and legal commands in order to produce data.  Being \u2018really responsive\u2019 \ndemands an awareness of the ways in which these different strategies both combine and \ncontribute to the broader  risk-based system \u2013 of, for instance the effect that using legal \ncommands plus criminal sanctions will have on the productivity of co-operative discussions. \nIn devising new responses to regulatory challenges, similar attention would be paid to \ncompatibilities of powers and tools.  Risk-based regulation, however, gives rise to numerous \nchallenges regarding such matters. It is a strategy that requires a significant amount of \ninformation, but some regulators simply do not have powers to require information from \nfirms (Black 2008; IOPS Report 2007). Others are restricted from adopting a risk-based \napproach by legal provisions which require them to inspect firms at legally specified \nintervals.8  Similar legal constraints can cut across regulators\u2019 ability to enforce a risk-based \nsystem and assess its success or failure.  Indeed, the performance criteria which are used to \nassess regulators themselves can inhibit them from adopting risk-based systems.  It was only \nwhen the Health and Safety Executive\u2019s (HSE\u2019s) sponsoring department moved away from \nusing the number of inspections carried out as a key performance indicator, for example, that \nthe HSE could move to a more risk-based approach.  A similar experience existed in the \ncontext of food safety, where European directives used to require inspections, and did not \nregard any other form of intervention as an adequate control (Black 2008). \nIn carrying out these different tasks, moreover, different strategies, powers and tools \nmight be used in different combinations. Thus, a regulator might employ a combination of \ndeterrence and educative strategies in order to encourage a firm to reduce risks but it might \napply a set of incentives together with a selection of disclosure rules in order to assess \nwhether regulation was reducing risks. One  consequent challenge would be to analyse how \nthe use of, say, a deterrence approach to compliance would impact on the firm\u2019s attitude to \nregulation and how the risk scoring system will take account of  such an effect. Another \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 17 \nchallenge would be to calculate whether an educative strategy adds or detracts from the use \nof a deterrence strategy. \n A further set of questions concerns the degree to which using certain strategies to \ndischarge some tasks will impact on the use of other strategies in relation to other tasks \u2013 for \nexample the extent to which applying deterrence\u2013based enforcement will impact on the \ndetection and information collection functions that are central to the risk-based regime.   This \ncan pose significant practical difficulties for risk-based regulators. Such regulators need \nconsiderable information from firms to sustain their oversight. They may, however, have to \nuse formal enforcement actions, such as fines, to change the behaviour of many firms.  In \nsuch circumstances responding to non-compliance with a deterrence approach may cut across \nthe ability to detect that non-compliance in the first place.  Firms know that any information \nthey give to the regulator may potentially be used against them in an enforcement action and \nthis can have a chilling effect on their cooperation with that regulator. A good, albeit \nanecdotal, example is the contrast in enforcement approaches of the two Australian financial \nregulators, APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  APRA \nhas a model of intensive supervision for its high risk financial institutions, but this does not \ninvolve using formal enforcement actions.  ASIC, on the other hand, has moved to a much \nmore deterrence-based approach. The consequence for their respective monitoring functions \nwas noted recently by an Australian lawyer, who quipped, \u2018When APRA asks for information, \nfirms give it to them; when ASIC asks, they call their lawyers.\u2019 (Note on file with author).   \nFinally, risk-based regulation has its own logic - that of risks and outcomes.  Risk-\nbased regulation starts with identifying risks to be managed, not rules to be complied with.  \nThe logic of risk and outcomes can cut across the logic of compliance. In a risk-based system \nof monitoring, officials are likely to find that non-compliance with certain rules does not in \nfact have an impact on the risk or outcome they are concerned with, suggesting of course that \nthe rule is otiose, or at least there is a mismatch between the rule-makers\u2019 perception of what \nis an appropriate conduct or process, and that of the supervisor, inspector or enforcer.  On \nthe other hand, an official monitoring a firm under a risk-based system may identify risks that \nshe thinks the firm should address, but which are not covered by any rule that would provide \na legal basis on which to require the firm to take action. The mismatching logics of risk and \ncompliance can thus produce significant lacunae in the regulatory regime at the point of \nimplementation and enforcement. \n \niv)  Responsiveness to regime performance \nReally responsive risk-based regulators will be performance sensitive \u2013 they will be \ncapable of measuring whether the enforcement tools and strategies in current use are proving \nsuccessful in achieving desired objectives. Such regulators will also operate systems that allow \nthem to justify their performance to the public and other interested parties. They will also be \nable to adjust their strategies in order to improve on the levels of performance that they have \nassessed. Many of those engaged in risk-based regulation are conscious of the need to ensure \nresponsiveness to regime performance, but finding appropriate ways to assess the outcomes \nof regulation can be extremely challenging.  The issues of performance sensitivity and \nperformance justification are discussed in this section and the question of performance \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 18 \nadjustment will be covered in the next section \u2013 which deals with adaptation to change more \ngenerally. \n \nPerformance sensitivity  \nPerformance sensitivity will demand a programme for assessing the performance of \nthe existing regime across the five core tasks of regulation. It will also require an \nunderstanding of those activities that detract from (or potentially detract from) the \nachievement of objectives but which are beyond the scope of the current regulatory regime or \nare \u2018off the screen\u2019 in the sense that they are going undetected.9 In order to set the basis for \nsuch sensitivity,  the regulator must, first, be clear regarding the objectives of the regulatory \nregime and the link between this and the risk-based system of control. For many UK \nregulators, the route to such clarity involves a translation of statutory objectives into a \nstatement of \u2018risks to objectives\u2019 and the construction of a risk-scoring system on the basis of \nthese risks (Black 2005).  \nFor risk-based regulators, however, performance sensitivity presents two particular \ndifficulties. First, risk-based regulation is by its nature orientated to the future, to what may \noccur.  If a risk does not crystallise, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to show that was the \nresult of the regulator\u2019s actions.  Proving counter-factuals is notoriously difficult.   Was the \nlack of an outbreak of salmonella in the last year, for example, due to the local authority\u2019s \nexcellent monitoring, or to improvements in food processing demanded by retailers, or to \nfood producers\u2019 own efforts independently of the supply chain, or simply luck?  Performance \nassessment is not impossible, however, it is just difficult.  Where a regulator is operating in an \nenvironment where there are numerous incidents occurring of a similar nature, and\/or where \ndata is easy to collect, then performance assessment is more straightforward.  Environmental \nregulators, for example, can use data on environmental quality to assess the effect of \nregulation, though establishing causal links between particular strategies and environmental \nquality can be difficult.  In the area of health and safety, there are particular types of recurrent \ninjuries at work, such as \u2018slips and trips\u2019, which occur with such regularity that together with \ndata obtained through firms\u2019 incident reporting obligations, the HSE is able not only to \ncollect data on their occurrence, but to identify from that where \u2018slips and trips\u2019 are likely to \noccur, and in what circumstances in different industry sectors.  It can then correlate changes \nin their incidence with changes in its own implementation policies to derive some indication \nof performance, albeit an imperfect one (e.g. HSE 2005). \nWhere regulators are regulating situations of uncertainty, rather than \u2018risk\u2019 as such, \nthen, by definition, there is no comparable set of data available on past incidences from \nwhich probabilities can be derived or against which regulatory strategies can be correlated.  \nEven in these situations, some regulators are starting to perform \u2018back-testing\u2019 assessments of \nindividual firms\u2019 risk assessments, however.  These are used to see a year later, for example, \nwhether the risks that the regulator thought may emerge have emerged, or whether \nmanagement and control systems were adequate to handle those which did emerge.  As noted \nabove, the results of such back-testing can be informative, and in that example, the regulator \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 19 \nadjusted the weighting of the assessments of management and control to allow for the \nrevealed bias.  \nThe second main difficulty that risk-based regulators have in dealing with \nperformance sensitivity is that the risk-based approach, like many other forms of regulation, \ninvolves delegation of many regulatory functions to the firms being regulated. It is a \nregulatory method that focuses attention on the quality of a firm's internal controls \u2013 in a \nprocess now commonly termed \u201cmeta-regulation\u201d- and is observable across a range of \nregulatory domains, and indeed countries (Braithwaite 2000; FSA 2000: Introduction; Parker \n2002; Coglianese and Nash 2001; Braithwaite, 2003; Walker 1969; Braithwaite and Drahos \n2000; Black 2005). The FSA, for example, is legally required to take into account the \nresponsibilities of senior management in performing its regulatory functions, and, to this end, \nit has devised a complex set of requirements for senior managers and other \u201capproved \npersons\u201d which go well beyond the normal bounds of directors' duties both in scope and \ncontent, and for which the individual may be sanctioned for non-compliance (Black 2005: \nnotes 185-6; Gray and Hamilton 2006).  \nReliance on, and hence assessment of, a firm's internal controls is, accordingly a \ncentral element of such risk-based frameworks \u2013 and is often seen as inevitable because \nregulators simply do not have the resources to do anything else. Such a layering of regulatory \ncontrols makes performance assessment particularly difficult though. A special problem is \nthat different actors \u2013 be they corporations, regulators, credit ratings agencies or other bodies \n\u2013 may use different models or \u2018codes\u2019 to evaluate risks. This means that in so far as regulators \nenrol such actors in the regulatory regime, this involves a substituting of these codes for the \njudgements and decisions of the regulators \u2013 and it does so in a manner that renders risk \nevaluations all the more opaque to regulators as well as to the broader community. When \nlayers of such codes are involved in the provision and evaluation of services \u2013 as when \ncorporations, credit ratings agencies, financial institutions and regulators are involved with a \nsecuritised product \u2013 there can be a worrying lack of connection between the regulator and \nthe risk evaluation (Gerding 2008; Gray 2009). \n Apart from the difficulties of modelling risks and amassing information in a \ntransparent and consistent manner, there are cultural divergencies that affect  regulators\u2019 \nabilities to assess performance by relying on firms\u2019 systems. Regulators think of objectives \nwith reference to statutory purposes but firms will see internal controls as properly directed at \nensuring that the firm achieves the objectives it sets for itself: namely profits and market \nshare. The risks that the regulator is concerned with will, indeed, not always be the same as \nthe risks the firms are focussed on.  Firms are ultimately concerned to ensure their own \nsurvival and growth, and if publicly listed, to maximise their returns to shareholders, despite \nthe inroads of corporate social responsibility initiatives. The firms\u2019 risk management systems \nmay be adequate for achieving the firms\u2019 own objectives but they may not be adequate for \nachieving the regulator's objectives. Such divergencies mean that regulators can never rely on \nthe firms\u2019 own systems either for implementation or for undistorted feedback or results.   \nA good example of the potential divergence   between managerial and regulatory \nsystems comes, again, from financial services. This is the UK FSA\u2019s \u2018Treating Customers \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 20 \nFairly\u2019 initiative. This was an intensive, principles-based monitoring system which required \nfirms to demonstrate that they were \u2018treating customers fairly\u2019 at every stage of the process of \nformulating, marketing and selling retail financial products.  The FSA also required firms to \nput in place various mechanisms to assess their own performance. One of the strategies the \nfirms used was a programme of customer satisfaction surveys. The FSA, however, disputed \nthe use of consumer satisfaction as an appropriate performance metric for demonstrating \ncompliance with the requirement that firms had sold customers products which were suitable \nto the financial objectives and risk appetite. The rationale for the suitability rule was that \ninvestment products are notoriously opaque and consumers have considerable difficulty \nunderstanding them.  (Consumers could be satisfied with the advice received, but their \nlimited ability to assess that advice might mean that such satisfaction was ill-founded.)   \nFirms, however, judged their performance on the likelihood that the customer would come \nback again, and could see no difference between suitability and satisfaction (FSA 2008). \n  The further complication to be noted by the really responsive regulator is that the \ndegree to which, and the way in which, assessment procedures can be \u2018delegated down\u2019 to \nfirm\u2019s internal control systems will vary across the tasks of regulation. Thus, relying on the \nfirm\u2019s risk management system to assess the detection of risks may involve quite different \nchallenges to those involved in relying on such systems to assess enforcement performance. \nAcross the tasks there may be quite different kinds of divergence between the regulators and \nthe firms with respect to such matters as the treating of evidence as relevant and how key \nconcepts such as \u2018compliance\u2019 are defined. For risk-based regulators, the special difficulty lies \nin assessing the complementarity or dissonance between the firms\u2019 evaluation systems and the \nrisk frameworks that reflect the regulator\u2019s objectives. Correlating the risk evaluation systems \nof the regulator with those of the firms may prove hugely demanding especially if variations \nacross firms are to be taken on board. \n \nPerformance Justification \n  As indicated above, really responsive regulators will be well-placed to justify their \nactions by making reference to assessments of performance and to undertakings on delivery. \nThe difficulty that flows from espousing risk-based regulation is that this is an approach that \nmakes lavish undertakings. Central to these is the promise that the challenges and \ncomplexities of regulation can be rationalised, systematised, ordered, managed, and \ncontrolled. As has been said of risk-based regulation: \u2019\u2026it suggests that the notoriously \ncomplex task of regulating can be rendered manageable, and that the contingencies of \nunpredictable events can be made controllable.\u2026hesitancies are lost in the confident \nexposition of risk identification, assessment and validation\u2019 (Black 2005).  The promise of \nrisk-based regulation is thus commonly seen as the delivery of a system that is not only more \nrational, cost-effective and controllable than other systems but more transparent and more \neasily deployed as a means of justifying regulatory actions and policies (Better Regulation \nTask Force 1999, 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Hampton 2004;  Gershon 2004: para.2.22;  O'Donnell \n2004: para.3.80; Hood et al  1999). At the political level, risk-based regulation was welcomed \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 21 \nin the UK as a way to curb what was seen as the insatiable appetite of politicians and the \nwider public for regulation ( Black 2005). \n       Delivery on these undertakings is extremely difficult, not least because there is often \nconsiderable dissonance between the regulator's understanding of risk priorities and those of \nthe firms, or indeed the wider public. Choosing which risks to focus on is a political, not a \ntechnical issue and judgements have to be made on such matters as: whether to target the \nlargest risks or the places where the largest risk reductions can be effected for a given level of \nresource input; whether to focus on individual risk creators or specific types of risk; the right \nbalance between acting on systemic risks and controlling individual risks; and ultimately what \nis an acceptable level of risk. A further issue of difficulty is whether to err on the side of over \nintervention (assuming that certain firms pose risks when they do not) or of under-\nintervention (assuming that they do not pose risks when they do). Each position on these \nissues brings contention and problems. One danger, for instance, of focusing only on firm-\nspecific risks is that regulators may pay too little attention to the potentially huge cumulative \neffect of particular types of compliance failures across firms (Black 2005: notes 141-151). \nAnother danger, as noted above, is that the regulators may also fail to pick up on trends of \nevents that are external to the firms and which might be relevant to their  risk assessments. \n       Nor does transparency always assist in legitimation. Regulating according to a \nrisk-based framework exposes the reality that there will be a limit on the resources that can be \nspent on controlling certain types of risk creators  (e.g. low impact firms), or on firms in \ncertain cases (for example, medium\/high impact but low risk). Such a framework also \nexposes the balance between individual and systemic risk controls. This means that officials \nare required to leave certain risks or types of risk uncontrolled or subject to limited \nsupervision. This can be difficult for regulatory managers to justify to the public and to \nregulatees. After a harmful event has occurred at a firm it may, for example, be difficult to \nexplain to the media that firms of that class are not regulated as a priority because they have \nrisk scores that are too low. Similarly, it may be difficult, after a systemic catastrophe such as \nthe credit crisis, to explain why systemic issues had not been given a higher priority.  \n   Risk-based systems may also be difficult to justify to staff who have to reconcile the \nadvertised technical neatness of those systems with the political messiness of the world that \nthey seek to control. An irony here is that risk-based regulation was sold within some \nregulatory bodies as a defence mechanism \u2013 on the basis that  if one followed the book, one \nwould be immune from criticism (Black 2005: notes 172-3).  The bureaucratic reality, \nhowever, has been that if senior management fail fully to articulate the extent to which they \nwill \u201cbuy in\u201d to the risk-based process so that they accept that mistakes will be made and that \nthings will be left undone, this will reduce the confidence of staff in the system and lead to \nthe taking of self-protective steps such as operating on the basis of factors other than risk \nanalyses (such as perceptions of political risks to themselves). This is liable to hamper the \nimplementation of the risk-based regime and reduce the rationality that lies at the heart of its \njustificatory claims.  \nA special justificatory challenge for risk-based regulation is to satisfy expectations \nregarding openness, transparency and accountability. Here again there are paradoxical \nelements. On the one hand, risk-based regulation holds out the prospect of transparency \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 22 \nthrough the exposure of its numerical\/analytic basis. On the other, a closer look at the \noperation of such systems reveals that they are not Richard Rogers edifices with the works on \nthe outside. Not only are they are built on high levels of discretion and politically contentious \njudgements but the important policies and decisions tend to be hidden away behind the \napparently neutral language of the risk assessment model (Black 2005). This point applies \nespecially to the definitions of thresholds for intervention, the risk assessments themselves, \nand the subsequent categorisations and scoring of firms. \n  All regulators have to prioritise the use of resources but the message of a really \nresponsive approach is that it is best to understand the implications of doing this through \nrisk-based processes. What can be seen is that framing the regulatory task in terms of risk \ninvolves buying into particular conceptions of the problem at hand, leads to the framing of a \nsolution in a particular way and produces special challenges of justification and legitimation. \nIn adopting risk-based frameworks, regulators attempt to define the acceptable limits of their \nresponsibility and hence accountability. It is also the case that matters of internal operation, \nnotably the construction of the risk-scoring system, are where the real choices are being made \nabout what matters to that regulatory agency and what does not: in particular about the \nselection of risks or levels of risk that the regulator is, or is not, going to take action on.10 In \nsuch processes risk-based regulation implicitly or explicitly defines what risks the regulator \nshould be expected to prevent, and those which it should not - those it should be blamed for \nnot preventing and those which it should not be blamed for not preventing. As Power has \nargued, attempting to manage risk requires a new \u2018politics of uncertainty\u2019, involving \nassessments not only of who should be responsible for dealing with its consequences but an \nappreciation that no-one is to blame for true uncertainty (Power 2005).  Risk-based regulation \nalso requires a new and related politics of accountability and a quite distinct mode of \nlegitimation. That politics involves new debates on who should be making decisions on the \nrisks that are important and those which are not. \n  Such issues of justification and legitimation, moreover, can be expected to vary \nacross the core tasks of regulation. The above discussion of risk-scoring, for instance relates \nto the task of discovery \u2013 of identifying targets for intervention. Quite different, but \nnevertheless risk-based-specific sets of issues will arise when looking at the processes of \nenforcement and compliance-seeking on the ground, or the processes of assessing \nperformance by means of risk analyses, or those of modifying regulatory strategy. The need \nto come to grips with all of these issues is the important message of the really responsive \napproach. \n \nv) Responsiveness to change \nA really responsive framework suggests that regulators and regulatory systems should \nbe dynamic, and capable of building on their performance sensitivity by learning from and \nimproving on their past performance. It also suggests that regulators should be able to adjust \nto the changes that constantly impact on regulation \u2013such as shifts in objectives, the advent \nof new risks and the emergence of new risk creators. These capacities to cope with change \n                                                 \n \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 23 \nshould, moreover, be reflected across all of the core regulatory tasks. Responsiveness, to \nchange, in addition, should involve a willingness and capacity to re-think regulatory strategies \nquite radically and to contemplate completely new forms of control mechanism if \nperformance assessments indicate that these are necessary. For risk-based regulators, \nhowever, such responsiveness involves quite particular challenges. \nWith regard to detection work, a central such challenge is the uncovering of new risks \nand risk-creators. In a risk-based regime, the inherent danger is that of \u2018model myopia\u2019 \u2013 that \nregulatory officials become committed to an historically-captured set of risk indicators and \nassessment criteria. Such commitment inhibits the regulator from responding to an \nunpredicted future. If the safest thing to do is to follow the risk framework, the way of least \nresistance is not to respond to any circumstances or events which are not anticipated by that \nframework. The irony is that risk-based frameworks are in danger of becoming \ninstitutionalised in a way that negates their capacity to deal with the very predictive inability \nthat they are intended to meet. \nThe credit crisis also showed that a further aspect of this danger of institutionalisation \nis that regulators may become committed to a risk model that is technically or intellectually \ndeficient in a manner that prevents adaptation to developing threats. Thus, an error of \nregulators in the period leading up to the credit crisis was the assumption that the \nsecuritisation process led  to greater risk spreading between institutions and individuals, and \nacross borders, and so produced safer, more risk resilient, as well as more efficient financial \nsystems. The shocking reality that the risk-based regulators had to come to terms with was \nthat they had failed to anticipate the way that institutional and trading interconnectivities \nwithin the global markets tended to lead to increasingly dangerous concentrations of risk and \nto higher, linked, vulnerabilities across the board. These developments eventually produced a \ncollapse in financial confidence that the regulators could not keep at bay (HM Treasury 2009: \npara. 3.30; US Government Accountability Office 2009). \nThe Hampton Review, indeed, endorsed the general strategy of risk-based regulation \nbut it was well aware of the danger that risk frameworks can prove too static. Hampton \nargued that regulation \u2018should always include a small element of random inspection\u2019 in order \nto check on the validity of the risk assessment system (Hampton 2005: para 2.38; Statutory \nCode of Practice for Regulators 2007: para. 6.2). A value of random inspection, on this view, \nis that it holds out the prospect of uncovering new risks and risk-creators in a way that is \nunlikely to flow from an inspection programme that is based on analyses of previously-\nidentified risks.  \nRandom inspections may also act as a useful deterrent to non-compliance, but as \ntechniques for combatting model myopia they are only consistent with a really responsive \napproach if the random inspections are performed in a way that breaks away from the normal \nrisk assessment framework. Only then will they pick up risks which may be systemic, or at \nleast which are not unique to that particular firm. Here again the institutional environment of \nthe risk-based system becomes important. Regulatory supervisors or inspectors need to feel \nable to communicate new or emerging risks to those in the policy or risk division in the \ncourse of their day to day monitoring and assessment activities. At best, there should be an \ninstitutionalisation of a dynamic process for identifying new or emerging risks.  Some \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 24 \nfinancial regulators, such as Canada\u2019s OSFI, initiated such an process during the financial \ncrisis, forming an \u2018emerging risks committee\u2019 comprised of supervisors and senior \nmanagement to systematise the identification and assessment of rapidly emerging risks, and \nanalyse their impact on the banks they regulated.   \n A second need for the really responsive risk-regulator is to react to change by \ndeveloping new rules and tools that will assist in detecting undesirable risk creation and in \nproducing compliance with relevant requirements. The institutional environment may inhibit \nthis, however, as the regulator may not have rule making powers, but has to rely on a \nlegislature, or in the EU context, the EU law making institutions to change the legal \nrequirements. Dynamism and reflexive responsiveness is hard to achieve in these situations.   \nA third need is closely related and that is to ensure that enforcement and compliance-\nseeking activities deal successfully with new risks and new risk-creators. On these fronts, \nhowever, there are problems that flow directly from adherence to risk-based regulation. One \nproblem is that if the regulators see the world through the lens of a given framework for risk \nanalysis (and delegates much of the application of this to firms), it is very difficult, as noted \nabove, for them to come to grips with new risks and risk creators by developing new control \nresponses. It may be especially difficult to move beyond the envelope of a risk framework if \nthose new risks and risk creators develop in another arena or on a different scale (e.g. global \nrather that national) \u2013 as in the credit crisis of 2007-9 when national regulators were slow to \nrespond to developing  problems of global system \u2013 wide risk (H M Treasury  2009). \nIn the case of new rules and tools to assist in compliance-seeking, the additional \ndifficulty is that a risk-based system may, as already indicated, focus more on identifying risks \nthan on ways to secure compliance or reduce those risks on the ground. The devising of new, \nadaptive, rules will, accordingly have to be guided by approaches and theories \u2013 such as \ncompliance, deterrence, or \u2018escalating response\u2019 strategies - that go beyond the remit of most \nrisk analyses. Here, though, there is a further problem. It is no simple matter to prescribe \nthat, for the purposes of compliance \u2013 seeking, risk-based systems should be combined with \nother systems. In the first instance, officials who are committed to a risk-based system (or \nwhose managers are so committed) may prove unresponsive to changes (either in legal \npowers or approaches to compliance-seeking) because they are reluctant to move away from \na \u2018pure\u2019 risk-based system. Second, where mixtures of risk-based and other approaches are \nused, these mixtures cannot be assumed to be free from tensions \u2013 a point suggested in \ndiscussing regulatory logics above. Where, for example a regulatory official allocates \nenforcement resources to deterrent activities in order to further compliance, this may involve \nprioritising the use of resources in a manner that departs from the prescriptions that would \nflow from the relevant risk analyses.  A similar effect is apparent when the regulator diverts \nattention to investigation activities prior to bringing enforcement actions.  The HSE, for \nexample, spends about 60% of its inspection resources on investigations after accidents prior \nto bringing prosecutions.  One reason for this is that firms now are more likely to contest \nprosecutions more vigorously, as a conviction for health and safety violation prejudices their \napplications for public procurement contracts.  This is a good example of the impact of the \nbroader institutional environment on the operation of a regulator\u2019s risk based approach.  The \nrisk based system, as a result, loses its purity and the risk analysis loses its power as a driver of \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 25 \nthe regime - which now operates as a hybrid risk-based\/deterrence\/incident-reactive system. \nThe same kinds of \u2018corruption\u2019 of the risk-based regime may occur where reference is made \nto other modes of compliance-seeking and would be likely to involve either or both \nresistance from those committed to the risk-based philosophy and a confusing hybridity. \nThe fourth and fifth core tasks of regulation involve the assessment and modification \nof performance. Risk- based regulation might be expected to cope well with these. After all, \nthe risk- based approach - at least the \u2018technical\u2019 vision of this \u2013 offers a ready means of \njudging performance. The risk scores of regulated firms and individuals can be compared year \non year (or month on month) and this will reveal whether overall levels of risk are increasing \nor decreasing.  This can provide some value, but as noted, more sophisticated systems of \nback-testing can be more useful.  Simply comparing risk scores year on year is prey to \n\u2018gaming\u2019 by officials, and even in its absence, it is limited as a method of performance \nassessment as it only tests the model within its existing parameters.   This poses a number of \ndifficulties.  First, such comparisons tend to focus on a given set of historically- established \nrisks and, if this is so, they will reveal little about the regulator\u2019s success or failure in coming \nto grips with new risks and new risk creators.  Second, a given framework for risk analysis will \npresuppose that there is a perfect fit between the risk framework and the regulator\u2019s \nobjectives \u2013 and it will accordingly give no indication of the extent to which undesirable risk \ncreation is escaping the regulatory net. There is liable to be no measure, for instance, of the \nprevalence of creative compliance or new types of risk creation or risk creators that are not \ncovered by the current rules. As a result, analyses of relative risk scores will not indicate \nwhether the regulatory regime is addressing a major portion of the challenges faced or only a \nsmall percentage of these.  \nA third problem that risk\u2013based systems may encounter in dealing with change is that \nsuch systems may make it difficult for regulators to adapt to shifts in preferences and \nobjectives. Risk- based regimes always have to contend with possible disjunctures between \nthe regulator\u2019s perceptions of risk and those of the public (or certain groups of interests) but \nthe additional problem to be noted here is that those disjunctures are not static. Preferences \nconcerning regulation often change \u2013 as seen in the post credit crisis period in the UK when \nsections of the  public, the Government, the regulators and the media  lost a good deal of \nfaith in \u2018light touch\u2019 regulation. The public may want different things of regulators at different \ntimes and so may governments, legislators, extra jurisdictional bodies and particular groups of \ninterests. The problem is that risk frameworks tend to lock regulators into a certain mode of \nanalysing risks, a certain position on identifying which risks are important and a particular \nposition on the thresholds for acting to control risks. If regulators are committed to the \nframework, they may be slow to respond to changes \u2013 especially when the processes of \nconstructing and developing that framework are positioned deep within the bureaucratic \nprocess and are, as a result, insulated from the public pressures that might be expected to \ngalvanise change.  \n A further problem is that if risk- based regulation involves a misalignment between \nthe institutional risks of the regulator (i.e. the risks to the regulator\u2019s reputation and \nobjectives) and risks to society (of harms such as  injuries or deaths), this may make the \nregulator unresponsive to changes in risks to society\u2019s interests. Thus, to cite Rothstein et al\u2019s \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 26 \nexample of rail safety (Rothstein et al 2006), a rail regulator may tend to focus on risks of \nmultiple fatality accidents to a degree that is not commensurate with the attention it devotes \nto the control of common minor accidents that cumulatively cause as many or more fatalities. \nIt may do so because it is aware that multiple fatality accidents may detract from the \nregulator\u2019s reputation in an especially negative and disproportionate manner. Controls of risks \nto the regulatory institution and risks to society are, for this reason, disjointed \u2013 but disjointed \nin a manner that may make the regulator less responsive to changes in risks to society (e.g. \nnew kinds of minor accident) than it might be if it operated a regulatory system other than \none that gives risks to the regulator\u2019s reputation and objectives a central place. \nSome regulators manage these challenges by incorporating public perceptions \nexplicitly into their risk-based frameworks.  For the UK Pensions Regulator, for example, a \nkey criterion for assessing risk is whether a failure in a particular area would lead to a loss of \npublic confidence in the regulator and in the pensions system.  Others manage it on a more \n\u2018fire-fighting\u2019 basis.  As the political salience of an issue increases, the regulator\u2019s risk \ntolerance decreases, or as one financial regulator commented during the crisis, \u2018events drive \nyou up the probability curve\u2019 (Black 2008). It may be argued that such responsiveness to \npolitical salience is appropriate, and a good example of \u2018spontaneous accountability\u2019: the \nregulator making itself accountable to political demands.  However, if a regulator is always \nresponsive to political assessments of risk, as amplified by the media and others, then risk \nbased regulation loses much of its identity as a systematised and rational way for regulators to \nmanage their resources. \nFinally, note should be taken of the special difficulties of contemplating radical \nchanges in regulatory strategy from \u2018within\u2019 a risk-based regulatory regime. The problem here \nis that a mindset  that centres on analysing and reacting to risks will not be readily attuned to \nthe consideration of ways in which risks can be \u2018designed out\u2019 of economic or social \nprocesses by  moving towards pre-emptive managerial strategies. Such shifts of approach may \ndemand a breadth of analysis that the \u2018process myopia\u2019 of the risk-based system does not \nencourage. The message of the \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach here is that the risk-based \nregulator should always be aware of the possible need to move beyond the merely responsive. \n \nConclusions \n  A \u2018really responsive\u2019 approach to risk regulation brings two central messages. The \nfirst is that it is best to regulate in a way that is responsive to: regulated firms\u2019 behaviour, \nattitude and culture; institutional environments; interactions of controls; regulatory \nperformance; and change. The second is that the challenges of regulation vary across the \ndifferent regulatory tasks and that astute regulators will deal with the variety of those \nchallenges. We have argued here that risk-based regulation has achieved broad acceptance \nwithin many governments and regulatory organisations but that there is a need to think in a \nmore structured manner about the ways in which risk-based regulation can come to terms \nwith the many hurdles to be overcome if it is to succeed on the ground. The \u2018really \nresponsive\u2019 framework, we suggest, offers a basis for such structured thinking. As shown \nabove, an application of the really responsive approach quickly exposes the kinds of question \nto which  risk-based regulators have to find answers  \u2013 but it also reveals that risk-based \nNon-copy edited version; forthcoming in 32(2) Law and Policy, spring 2010 \n 27 \nregulation imposes quite distinct structures on the challenges that have to be risen to if \nregulation is to succeed. In addition, the really responsive approach forces us to shift our \nconception of risk-based regulation so that it is seen not as a free-standing and technical \nguide to regulatory intervention but as a particular way to construct the regulatory agenda and \nas a control strategy that has to be combined with other control strategies in different (and \noften contentious) ways across different contexts and regulatory tasks. \n  Being really responsive involves coming to grips with numbers of issues in a manner \nthat might appear to be daunting and difficult to operationalise. Those difficulties are, \nhowever, vastly outweighed by the costs of regulatory failure. If there is one message to take \nfrom the credit crisis, it is that there is a colossal price to pay if regulators do not deal \nadequately with the challenges discussed here \u2013 notably, in the case of banking, those \nproduced by changes in the nature of risks or risk creators and by the constraints that flow \nfrom the institutional environments in which the regulators and regulated firms work. \n \n \n \n                                                               NOTES \n1. \u2018Risk-based regulation\u2019 has a range of meanings- see Black 2008. \n2. The evidence is mixed regarding the culpabilities of risk-based regulation, as banks in \nAustralia and Canada, whose regulators have well-developed systems of risk-based \nregulation, fared far better than those in other Western countries, suggesting that the causes \nof regulatory failure were more complex than are accounted for by the existence of a risk-\nbased system of supervision.   \n3.

In the UK the Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators 2007: para. 6.3 states that \nregulators \u2018should focus their greatest inspection effort\u2019 on regulated entities where a \nbreach would pose a serious risk to regulatory outcome and where there is a high likelihood \nof non-compliance by regulated entities.  \n7. There is a danger in  compounding  quantitative risk analyses with  quantitative \n'amenability analyses' so that a kind of 'quantitative ritualism' results.  Similar scepticism \napplies to seeing amenability issues in 'risk' terms - for a discussion of the diminishing \nreturns that can be achieved by seeing all issues as 'risk issues' see Rothstein et. al. (2006). \n8.
