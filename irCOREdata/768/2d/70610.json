This system is\nused as a model for the cardiorespiratory interaction in wakefulness and anaesthesia. We show that long-\nrange correlated noise produces transitions between epochs with different n:m synchronisation ratios, as\nobserved in the cardiovascular system.

The dependence of the synchronisation time on the couplings, in the presence of noise,\nis studied; such dependence is softened by low-frequency noise. We show that the coupling from the slow\noscillator to the fast one (respiration to heart) plays a more important role in synchronisation. Finally, we\nsee that the isolines with same synchronisation time seem to be a linear combination of the two couplings.\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Oscillators and synchronisation\nThere are innumerable examples in nature of self-sustained oscillators. Such systems exhibit an oscillatory\nbehaviour by themselves, i.e., even without any external action 1. When two or more oscillatory processes are\ncoupled, there exists the possibility of their becoming synchronised. Synchronisation entails an adjustment of\nrhythms of oscillating objects due to their interaction [1].\nFor instance, if we isolate a plant, an animal or a human volunteer and keep them at constant conditions\nof light and temperature, they still exhibit a rhythm with a period of approximately 24 hours. Therefore, this\nbiological clock is definitely self-sustained, because it exhibits an oscillatory nature without any other interactions.\nIn normal life, however, we are exposed to the variations in light, temperature, etc., as the day goes. That is\nhow our biological clock synchronises with the day\u2019s rhythm and, as a result, our internal rhythm repeats every\n24 hours.\nSynchronisation happens everywhere in nature. This entrainment can be either \u201cintended\u201d or \u201cmechanical\u201d.\nThe former occurs when intelligent individuals adjust their rhythms in order to achieve a goal, e.g., workers\nin an assembly line, or musicians playing in an orchestra. We call here \u201cmechanical\u201d synchronisation when it\nhappens in non-intelligent systems, e.g., two pendulum clocks placed on a common support. This \u201cmechanical\u201d\nsynchronisation is perfectly described by Strogatz: \u201cSync does not depend on intelligence, or life, or natural\nselection. It springs from the deepest source of all: the laws of mathematics and physics\u201d [2]. One might also\nthink of an intermediate stage, synchronisation in intelligent individuals arising spontaneously. One example\n1As dissipation almost always occurs, oscillators must have an internal source of energy that maintains their rhythm.\nPublished in Proc. SPIE vol. 6802, ed. Abbott et al, art. no. 68020U (2008).\nof this are the occasions when people inside a completely silent room unwittingly end up breathing exactly at\nonce. Another example is the claps by an audience: after a few seconds a main rhythm is heard, generated\nby spectators clapping synchronously, and also some \u201cnoise\u201d, generated by the not-so-synchronised spectators\n2. The borderline between \u201cintended\u201d and \u201cmechanical\u201d synchronisation may not be well-defined, as some\n\u201cmechanical\u201d couplings might play a role in order for the system to achieve a common goal (in the previous\nexample of the musicians, a violinist with tendency to slow down will unwittingly speed up as hearing his\/her\nneighbour colleagues).\nThe example of the spectators\u2019 claps above is an everyday example of high-order synchronisation. Although\nmost (of the synchronised) spectators applaud at the same rhythm, there are some enthusiasts who applaud at\nhigher rate, and some people more lazy (or dissatisfied with the performance) that clap more slowly. But, still,\nthey are synchronised with the main group: the enthusiasts clap, for example, twice when the bigger group claps\nonce, and the lazies clap, say, once every four claps of the big group. That is why this high-order synchronisation\nis also called n:m synchronisation. High-order synchronisation happens when the oscillatory processes operate\nin different timescales.\n1.2 Synchronisation in the cardiorespiratory interaction\nOne case of two oscillatory processes operating in different timescales is the cardiorespiratory interaction. The\nheart beats at rest at approximately once per second, and one respiratory cycle at rest may take around four\nseconds (both values depend on the individual). For this individual, the preferred synchronisation ratio, if any,\nwould be 4:1. In fact, episodes of synchronisation in the cardiorespiratory system are inferred from the data\nobtained from non-invasive measurements [3], and the probability of such synchronisation happening by chance\nis extremely small [4]. Moreover, cardiorespiratory synchronisation may have some outstanding applications in\nmedical assessment and monitoring. For example, athletes are observed to synchronise for periods up to 10\ntimes longer than non-athletes [5]. Also, in measurements on anaesthetised rats [6, 7], lengthy synchronisation\nepochs, and transitions from one synchronisation ratio to another, are observed. Such transitions may be useful\nin monitoring depth of anaesthesia.\nWhether cardiorespiratory synchronisation is just \u201cmechanical\u201d or it also has an \u201cintelligence component\u201d \u2013\nwe might speculate if the brain could smartly give orders to heart and respiration to synchronise to some extend,\nin case it would be more efficient for the body \u2013 is not clear. But the existence of couplings between heart and\nrespiration is known, some signs of that are the following:\n\u2022 Heart rate is slightly higher in inspiration than in expiration, phenomenon known as \u201crespiratory sinus\narrhythmia\u201d [8].\n\u2022 The respiratory function can modify the amplitude of cardiac oscillations (stroke volume) [9].\n\u2022 Traube in 1865 and Hering in 1869 independently observed waves in systemic blood pressure associated\n[10] with respiration.\nTherefore, and for the sake of simplicity, we can model cardiorespiratory interaction as two coupled oscillators\n(the heart and the respiration). As these oscillators operate in different timescales, we can expect episodes of\nhigh-order synchronisation, which is in accordance with what is observed [3]. It is known that the coupling from\nrespiration to heart is stronger than vice versa [11].\nThe existence of transitions between different n:m synchronisation ratios, and also to and from non-synchronised\nepochs, exhibits that the system is non-autonomous, i.e., it has an explicit time dependence. From the Physics\nviewpoint, explicit time dependence means that there is something from outside acting on the system. In the\ncase of the cardiorespiratory system, this action comes (at least) from the low-frequency oscillatory processes in\nthe cardiovascular system, known to be metabolic, neurogenic and myogenic [12].\n2 Cf. http:\/\/www.audionetworkplc.com\/sfx\/sfx list.asp?subcat id=8961 , that we found via google. On that webpage we\ncan listen to several demos for free, and purchase the tracks in full quality. On track with number S 402410 we hear a perfectly\nsynchronised clapping audience, phenomenon found in some countries of Eastern Europe. On the other hand, on track with number\nS 377155, for example, we hear a main rhythm plus some \u201cnoise\u201d.\n1.3 Anaesthesia versus awareness\nUsually in anaesthesia, the coupling from respiration to heart decreases, and the coupling from heart to respi-\nration increases, compared with awareness. However, the former interaction usually remains stronger than the\nlatter. Nevertheless, in some moments of anaesthesia, the direction may either reverse, or the cardiorespiratory\ninteraction may become insignificant [7].\nBoth heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration rate variability (RRV) dramatically decrease in anaesthesia\ncompared to awareness. Also, wavelet analysis reveals that low frequency components in blood flow are dramat-\nically lower in anaesthesia than in wakefulness. On the other hand, the ratio of synchronisation time over total\ntime is much bigger in anaesthesia.\nIn fact, analysis of experimental data [13] also reveals that synchronisation and modulation are competing\neffects: in short, the stronger the modulation, the lower the ratio of synchronisation time. In principle, intuition\nsays that this is consistent, because the bigger the system is disturbed, the more difficult it is for it to \u201csettle\u201d\n(synchronise); but a deeper analysis on how time variability interferes with synchronisation is still lacking.\nIn this paper, we use a simple model for the cardiorespiratory interaction. We obtain numerically several\nsynchronisation epochs and the transitions. We also analyse the effect of the noise \u2013 white and coloured \u2013, that\nacts on each oscillator, on the total synchronisation time; and the same with the values of the couplings from\none oscillator to the other. We will see that the results arising from the model reproduce the properties, inferred\nfrom the experimental observations, that we have stated.\n2 Model and analytical tools\n2.1 The model\nAssuming that the values of the couplings are small, we can make phase dynamics [14]. We use then two phase\noscillators, modelling respiration and heart. For simplicity, we consider the same function for the interaction on\nboth equations, although this function is multiplied by different values (the couplings) on each equation. A noise\nterm is added to the equations of both oscillators,\n\u03b8\u02d9 = \u03c91 + \u03b51 f(\u03b8, \u03c6) + \u03b71(t)\n\u03c6\u02d9 = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03b52 f(\u03b8, \u03c6) + \u03b72(t)\n(1)\nHere \u03c6 is the slow oscillator, modelling the respiration, and \u03b8 the fast oscillator, modelling the heart. The \u03c9\u2019s\nare the autonomous frequencies, the \u03b5\u2019s are the couplings, the function f is the interaction, and the \u03b7\u2019s are the\nnoise terms.\nThe function f must be 2pi-periodic in both arguments. For this work, we chose a very simple function,\nconsisting of a limited number of harmonics with the same weight:\nf(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n2\u2211\nj=1\n10\u2211\ni=1\nsin(j\u03b8 \u2212 i\u03c6) (2)\n2.2 High-order synchronisation\nWe describe briefly how interaction can induce synchronisation. Let us consider equations (1) without the\nnoise terms. In the zero approximation (neglecting the interaction) the phases rotate with their autonomous\nfrequencies:\n\u03b8 = \u03c91t, \u03c6 = \u03c92t\nWhen \u201cplugging in\u201d the interaction, all the terms in f correspond to fast rotations except for those satisfying\nthe resonance condition [1]:\nj\u03c91 \u2212 i\u03c92 \u2248 0 (3)\nIn the case that the two autonomous frequencies are nearly in resonance\n\u03c91\n\u03c92\n\u2248\nn\nm\n, n,m \u2208 N, (4)\nall the harmonics in f with j = mk, i = nk, k being an integer, are resonant and contribute to the equations\naveraged in time. That is how the interaction produces n:m synchronisation when \u03c91\/\u03c92 does not differ too\nmuch from n\/m. The maximum allowed detuning m\u03c91 \u2212n\u03c92 for which synchronisation is still induced is bigger\nfor higher values of the couplings (Cf. [1, 14] for details).\n2.3 Coloured noise\nSequences of long-range correlated values \u03b7i(t) are produced by the Fourier filtering method in [15]. This method\nis based on a transformation of the Fourier components {u(k)} of a random number sequence {u(t)} which are\nuncorrelated random numbers following a Gaussian distribution. A sequence of \u03b7i(k) is generated for a given \u03b1\nusing the formula:\n\u03b7i(k) = k\n\u2212(2\u03b1\u22121)\/2 u(k) = k\u2212\u03b2\/2 u(k).\nInverse Fourier transformation of the sequence \u03b7i(k) leads to the sequence of interest \u03b7i(t). The resulting sequence\nof random variables are spatially correlated with spectral density\nSk \u221d k\n\u2212(2\u03b1\u22121) = k\u2212\u03b2 ,\nand they have Gaussian distribution. The parameter \u03b1 is called the correlation exponent, and quantifies the\ndegree of correlations imposed in the sequence. The case \u03b1 = 0.5 (or \u03b2 = 0) corresponds to uncorrelated disorder\n(white noise), while the case \u03b1 > 0.5 (\u03b2 > 0) indicates positive correlations. The mean value of the sequences\nproduced by this method is set to zero.\n2.4 Synchronisation index\nTo characterise the strength of synchronisation we need a quantitative measure. We will use an index based on\nconditional probability introduced in [16]. First we must choose the n:m ratio in which we are interested.\nThe phase of the faster oscillator is observed at fixed values of the slower oscillator. In a situation of perfect\nn:m synchronisation, always that (\u03c6 mod 2pim) has a given fixed value, (\u03b8 mod 2pin) has always the same value\nas well. In noisy systems, of course, instead of saying \u201cthe same value\u201d for the latter, we must say \u201cthe same\nvalue up to some tolerance\u201d.\nFirst of all, the interval to which (\u03c6 mod 2pim) belongs, [0, 2pim), is divided into N bins. As we are calculating\nthe synchronisation index as a function of time, we use a time window, centred at tk, in which we analyse the\ndistribution of the phases. Let us think of the bin number l of the interval [0, 2pim), and let us call tj , with\nj = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Ml, the values of the time, inside the timewindow, for which (\u03c6 mod 2pim) falls into the l\nth bin 3.\nWe have, then, Ml values {\u03b8(tj) mod 2pin}. If there is no synchronisation at all, then a uniform distribution of\n{\u03b8(tj) mod 2pin} can be expected in the interval [0, 2pin). In the case of n:m synchronisation, these numbers\ncluster around a certain value. The strength of such clustering is quantified as\nrl(tk) =\n1\nMl\nMl(tk)\u2211\nj=1\nexp\n(\ni\n\u03b8(tj)\nn\n)\n(5)\nWhen the phases are completely locked, or completely unlocked, we get |rl(tk)| = 1 or |rl(tk)| = 0 respectively.\nTo improve reliability we also calculate the average over all bins and obtain the index of synchronisation as\n\u03bbnm(tk) =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nl=1\n|rl(tk)| (6)\nWe consider, then, that the system is n:m synchronised at time tk when \u03bbnm(tk) is bigger than a given\nthreshold. In practice we usually find, by trial and error, values for the threshold that may be regarded, at first\nsight, as too stringent. In this work, we set the threshold to 0.98.\nWe must test the synchronisation index for different values of n and m. According with what was explained\nin Subsection 2.2, we test the numbers over which the summation in (2) runs.\n3We are working, of course, with discrete values of time, because we are dealing with either experimental or numerical data.\nThat is why Ml makes sense (i.e., \u201cit is not infinite\u201d).\n 0.98\n 0.982\n 0.984\n 0.986\n 0.988\n 0.99\n 0.992\n 0.994\n 0.996\n 0.998\n 1\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900  1000\nSy\nnc\nhr\non\niza\ntio\nn \nin\nde\nx\nTime\n5:1\n3:2\n5:2\n9:2\n10:2\nFigure 1: Synchronisation epochs and transitions\n3 Simulations\n3.1 Synchronisation epochs and transitions\nWe simulated equations (1) with parameters \u03bd1 = 1.07, \u03bd2 = 0.23\n4, \u03b51 = 0.2, \u03b52 = 0.05. The intensity of the\nnoise is given by its variance \u03c32, that we will call D. Here we use D1=5 e\u20134, D2=5 e\u20135.\nFigure 1 shows the different synchronisation epochs. Transitions between different n:m synchronisation ratios\nare observed as well (strictly speaking: transitions from a synchronisation epoch to a non-synchronised epoch, and\nthen a transition from a non-synchronised epoch to a different synchronisation ratio). Note that the transitions\nare \u201ccontinuous\u201d, i.e., from a synchronisation ratio to another ratio similar to the former.\nLong-range correlated noise produces transitions between epochs with different n:m synchronisation ratios,\nwhich is consistent with the observations of the cardiovascular system (remember the low frequency components\nmentioned in Subsection 1.2). On the other hand, with white noise, there are very few transitions between\nsynchronisation indices [17].\nBasically, the trick is that we might absorb the noise term into the autonomous frequency:\n\u03c9 + \u03b7(t) \u2261 \u03c9\u02dc(t),\n4Of course, \u03bd = \u03c9\/2pi. Strictly speaking, dimensionless units are used throughout this paper. Nevertheless, if we consider the\ntime to be in seconds, these frequencies are chosen as two possible realistic values for the frequencies of heart and respiration.\n 0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\nSynchronization time\n 0  0.001  0.002  0.003  0.004  0.005\nD1\n 0\n 0.0001\n 0.0002\n 0.0003\n 0.0004\n 0.0005\nD\n2\nFigure 2: Synchronisation time as a function of the intensities of the two noises. The total simulation time is\n1,000\nthereby considering, in the case of long-range correlated noise, as though the \u03c9\u2019s had a slow trend in time. As a\nresult, the integers of the RHS of (4) change in time, and so does the synchronisation ratio. In the case of white\nnoise, however, the \u201ctime-dependent frequencies\u201d do not have any trend.\n3.2 Noise and synchronisation\nNow we analyse how the intensity of the noise influences the synchronisation time. We chose the parameters\n\u03bd1 = 1.07, \u03bd2 = 0.23, \u03b51 = 0.1, \u03b52 = 0.01, and varied the parameters D1 and D2 (the range of variation of\nD1 and D2 is not the same because \u03b71 and \u03b72 are summed to \u03c91 and \u03c92 respectively, and the frequencies are\nconsiderably different).\nFigure 2 shows the total synchronisation time as a function of the intensities of the two noises. This figure\nclearly shows that the bigger the noise, the smaller the synchronisation time. This result reproduces the ex-\nperimental result that, in anaesthesia, the low-frequency components are dramatically suppressed compared to\nwakefulness, and the synchronisation time is considerably bigger.\nIf we move vertically in Figure 2, the synchronisation time changes much more than moving horizontally. It\nmeans that the noise in the slower oscillator (the respiration) hinders synchronisation much more strongly than\nthe noise in the faster oscillator.\n3.3 Couplings and synchronisation\nFinally, we analyse how the values of the two couplings influence the synchronisation time, in the scenarios of\ncoloured and white noise, and with different intensities of such noise. The couplings \u03b51 and \u03b52 are varied (again,\nthe range of variation is not the same because \u03c91 and \u03c92 are considerably different). The results are plotted in\nFigure 3.\nFrom this figure, we can obtain several conclusions. The first one is that low-frequency noise \u201csoftens\u201d the\ndependence of the synchronisation time on the couplings: when the synchronisation time is big, it lowers in the\npresence of coloured noise; when the synchronisation time is small, it rises in the presence of coloured noise.\nSecondly, as expected, the synchronisation time is bigger for bigger values of the couplings. Furthermore, vi-\nsual inspection of Figure 3 reveals that the equations of the isolines, in the \u03b51\u2013\u03b52 plane, with same synchronisation\ntime, seem to be a linear combination of the couplings \u03b51 and \u03b52.\nFinally, we observe that \u03b51, the coupling from the slow oscillator to the fast one (respiration to heart) plays a\nmore important role in synchronisation than \u03b52 (for example, if we go to the right border in Figure 3, i.e., make\n\u03b51 big, the synchronisation time hardly varies with \u03b52).\nFor the white noise scenario, the results are plotted in Figure 4. Note that the intensity of the noise here is\nmuch bigger than in Figure 3, and unrealistic for most physical situations. The reason for making the intensity\nso big was to obtain some noticeable differences in the three plots in Figure 4.\nThe conclusions here are the same as in the former scenario with coloured noise, except that, although white\nnoise also \u201csoftens\u201d the dependence of the synchronisation time on the couplings, the effect is dramatically lower\nthan in the case of coloured noise (the intensities of the noise in Figure 4 are much bigger than in Figure 3 and,\nstill, the former is much less \u201csoftened\u201d than the latter).\n4 Conclusions\nWe have shown that long-range correlated noise produces transitions between epochs with different n:m syn-\nchronisation ratios, which is consistent with observations in the cardiovascular system.\nAlso, we have seen that, the bigger the noise, the smaller the synchronisation time. Furthermore, the noise\nin the slower oscillator (the respiration) hinders synchronisation much more strongly than the noise in the faster\noscillator. These results also reproduce the observed result that, in anaesthesia, the synchronisation time is\nbigger than in wakefulness.\nRegarding the dependence of the synchronisation time on the couplings, such dependence is softened by\nlow-frequency noise. White noise also softens the dependence, but much less than coloured noise.\nThe synchronisation time increases as any of the two couplings increases. Nevertheless, the coupling from\nthe slow oscillator to the fast one (respiration to heart) plays a more important role in synchronisation.\nThe isolines, in the plane \u03b51\u2013\u03b52 of the values of the couplings, with same synchronisation time, seem to be a\nlinear combination of the couplings \u03b51 and \u03b52. So if, in anaesthesia, \u03b51 (respiration to heart) lowers but \u03b52 (heart\nto respiration) rises, and noise drops, the synchronisation time is definitely bigger than in awareness, despite the\ndrop in \u03b51.\nReferences\n[1] A.
