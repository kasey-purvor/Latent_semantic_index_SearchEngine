Escape from a metastable potential is considered on time-scales less than\nare needed for the creation of quasi-equilibrium within the well. It is shown that the\nescape flux may then depend exponentially strongly, and in a complicated way, on\nfriction and time.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn his celebrated paper [1], Kramers considered the flux from a metastable po-\ntential well (Fig. l(a)) induced by weak noise. Over the last 60 years, there have\nbeen many developments and generalizations of the Kramers problem (see [2,3]\nfor major reviews). However both Kramers and most of those who followed him\nconsidered the quasi-stationary flux, i.e. the flux that occurs on a time-scale ex-\nceeding the time needed for the formation of a quasi-stationary distribution within\nthe metastable well. But what happens on shorter time-scales?\nThe process of formation of the quasi-equilibrium differs markedly depending on\nwhether there are, or are not, internal barriers within the metastable part of the\npotential: c.f. Figs. l(b) and (a) respectively. In the latter case, the formation time\nis of the order of an optimal fluctuation duration topt (equal to the characteristic\nrelaxation time) whereas, in the former case, the formation proceeds via two distinct\nstages: first, quasi-equilibrium is formed within the initial well, much as in the\nsingle-well case; secondly, equilibrium between different wells is established, which\nCP511, Unsolved Problems of Noise and Fluctuations, edited by D.

Correspondingly, escapes for these two cases\noccur quite differently.\nESCAPE ON DIFFERENT TIME-SCALES\nFig. 2 presents some typical results from a computer simulation of the escape\nflux from the potential shown in Fig. l(b). The system is put initially into the\nbottom of well-1, and then it follows the stochastic equation\n(i)\n=0,\nU(q) = |0-\n(f(t)f(t'))=2TT6(t-t'),\nat q<qi=4.5,\nat q>qt,\nuntil either the coordinate limit qi or a (rather arbitrary) time limit t\\ = 1000 is\nreached, after which the system is reset to the bottom of the well-1 and everything\nis repeated. Once the statistics are deemed adequate, the flux\n(2)Nte:\nis computed as a function of time. Here, A^reset is the overall number of resettings\nand AJV(t) is the number of escapes that occur in the interval [t,t + At] where\nAt is chosen to be much larger than the typical interval between two successive\nescapes, but much smaller than characteristic time-scales at which the flux may\nchange significantly.\nOne can resolve in Fig. 2 all the stages mentioned above: an initial rapid growth\nof J on a time-scale ~ topt; then a slow decay over a time ts (related to the formation\nof quasi-equilibrium between wells 1 and 2); and finally an even slower exponential\n(quasi-stationary) decay with a time-scale tqs ^> ts.\n504\ntFIGURE 2. Simulations of the escape flux J(t) (2) (thin jagged line) for the model (1) (see\nU(q) in Fig. l(b)) with F = 0.15, T = 0.4, compared with approximations of J(i) by Eq. (3) in\nwhich ai2, \u00ab2i and aqs are calculated by the Kramers-Melnikov formula [3]. The thick full line is\nfor arises = ags(l-|-(QiQ2~1 exp((C\/i \u2014 U2)\/T))\u00b1l)\/(l + (m~1 exp(Ar5's2^.Si\/^)):tl), where QI and\nf^2 are frequencies of eigenoscillation in the bottom of wells 1 and 2 respectively; k is equal to 1\nand -1 for ranges F providing noise-free trajectories 82 ^  2 and 82 ^ i 1 respectively; the action\nSs2->-Si f\u00b0r the transition 82 \u2014> Si is calculated from the theory [5]; m is the only adjustable\nparameter, related to the prefactor in (4) (here, m rc 0.9). For comparison, the dashed line is for:\nQfl3 = 0, C*23 = OtqsQ + Of21\/Of 12)-\nThe flux J(i) can be well-described in terms of kinetic equations for the well\npopulations, using the concept of inter-attractor1 transition rates a^ (c.f. [4]):\nJ(t) = (3)\n> ^opt-\nThe significance of the two terms in (3) is easily understood (c.f. Fig. 2). The first\none, corresponding to direct escapes (i.e. not via the bottom of well-2), dominates\nduring the first and second stages; whereas the second term, corresponding to\nindirect escapes, dominates in the third stage. The asymptotic part of this latter\nflux, a g 5 exp(\u2014 t \/ t q s ) , is called the quasi-stationary flux.\nAlthough the coefficients ai2, a2i, aqs can readily be obtained from the Kramers-\nMelnikov theory [3] 2, ai3,a23 cannot be found [3] in this way. One of us [5] has\ndeveloped a theory of ai3, a2s based on the concept of optimal fluctuation. The\nlatter suggests seeking the escape rate, e.g. ais, in the form\n(4)\nHere the action S does not depend on T, whereas the prefactor P depends relatively\nweakly both on T and on other parameters.\n-\n1) For the sake of brevity, we refer to region 3 as an \"attractor\" too.\n2) Note that they (as well as a quasi-stationary flux) depend on friction weakly.\n505\nFIGURE 3. Dependence of the action for the transition 82 \u2014>\u2022 Si on the damping constant F,\nat time-scales t ^> <opt, in the system (1) (see U(q) in Fig. l(b)). The solid line is calculated\nnumerically from the theory [5]. The horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicate respectively the\nupper limit for Ss2->-Si and the value of F at which the cutoff of direct transitions 82 \u2014> Si and\nescapes 1\u2014^82 occurs. The crosses and squares represent digital and analogue simulation data\nrespectively. The inset shows an expanded plot of the region of small damping.\nThe physics and theory of the direct escape process are essentially different on\ntime scales t ^> \u00a3opt, t ~ topi and t <C topi . We consider these in turn.\nLong time-scale: t ^> topt. On this time-scale, ai3 does not depend on time, but\nits dependence on friction is exponentially strong at sufficiently small temperatures\n(c.f. Fig. 3). Moreover, it undergoes oscillations3 in the underdamped range, and\ncan have a cutoff at certain friction F0 from the moderate-to-high friction range\n(i.e. ais = 0 at F > TO). The oscillations are related to an alternation between\nranges of friction in which a noise-free trajectory from the external saddle 82 goes\ninto either well-1 or well-2. The cutoff at large F is related to the absence of turning\npoints in the noise-free trajectories 82 ^4 2, Si ^4 2. Our experimental technique\nenables a 13 to be measured with sufficient accuracy to observe these interesting\nfeatures, and experiment and theory are (Fig. 3) in satisfactory agreement.\nMedium time-scale: t ~ topt. The escape flux then becomes non-stationary\nbecause the most probable escape path (MPEP) now depends on a given escape\ntime t which it should provide, so that action along the MPEP becomes dependant\non t, thus, leading to a strong (but smooth) drop of J(t) as t decreases. This is\nequally relevant both to single-well and multi-well metastable potentials, and to\ninter-attractor transition rates in multi-well stable potentials. In earlier studies, an\nanalytic solution was presented [6] for the overdamped regime in a piece-wise linear\npotential; and an asymptotic theory was developed [7] for an arbitrary single-well\npotential in the strongly underdamped and overdamped regimes.\nShort time-scales: t <C topi. Apart from its intrinsic interest and fundamen-\n3) Typically, the scale of oscillation of S is small in comparison with C\/s2 \u2014 U\\ (the latter corre-\nsponds to the Arrhenius dependence of a conventional quasi-stationary flux on T [1]- [3]) but, in\nsome cases, it can be equal or even greatly exceed U$2 \u2014 U\\ [5].\n506\nA U\nFIGURE 4. Calculated dependence (solid line) of the action S on the time t of escape from the\nbottom of the (inset) potential well U(q) = {q^ ^ q<^j (T = 0.05). The dashed line in the\nmain figure shows the large-time asymptote level, equal to the barrier height Af7.\ntal significance, this limit is also highly topical given the advent of experimental\ntechniques that allow one to study processes related to fluctuations on exceedingly\nshort time-scales: see e.g. [8] in which the dynamics of a chemical reaction is stud-\nied on a femtosecond time-scale. We have found explicitly the MPEP and action\nfor a particular model (see inset of Fig. 4). Fig. 4 shows how the action depends on\nthe escape time from the bottom of the well (i.e. from the stable stationary state of\nthe noise-free system) to beyond the barrier. It indicates that the flux should grow\nwith time in a step-wise manner (exponentially sharply) until a quasi-stationary\nvalue is reached at t ^> topi. The higher a step is, the larger the number of turning\npoints in the MPEP (at large \u00a3, the MPEP coincides with the noise-free trajectory\nrelaxing from the saddle into the well, but reversed in time). The physical origin\nof the steps lies in the oscillatory character of noise-free trajectories at small and\nmoderate friction. Thus, we expect it to be a general phenomenon, arising in both\nsingle-well and multi-well potentials. It is interesting to note also that, in the more\nformal problem of a transition for a given time between two given states, neither\nof which is stable, the transition flux J(i) generally undergoes exponentially strong\noscillations at t <C topt .\nCONCLUSIONS AND OPEN PROBLEMS\nEscape from a metastable potential differs markedly after and before the forma-\ntion of quasi-equilibrium within the metastable part of the potential. The formation\nprocess is essentially different for single-well and multi-well metastable potentials.\nIn the former case (Fig. l(a)), the formation time is relatively short, namely of the\norder of an optimal fluctuation duration, whereas it is exponentially longer in the\nlatter case (Fig. l(b)).\nEscape on this latter time-scale has been studied in our work for the first time,\nboth theoretically and experimentally: unlike the conventional quasi-stationary\n507\nflux, the escape flux on this time-scale depends on friction exponentially sharply,\nmoreover, it can undergo oscillations in the underdamped range and a cutoff in the\noverdamped range. (Fig. 3).\nFor t <C topt, we have demonstrated theoretically for the first time that the\nescape flux depends exponentially strongly on both friction and time; moreover, if\nthe friction is small or moderate, it grows with time in a step-wise manner (Fig. 4).\nOpen problems yet to be addressed include -\n\u2022 To study theoretically and experimentally the dependence of the pre-\nexponential factor in the escape probability from a multi-well metastable po-\ntential on F, T and U(q): it is as fundamental a problem as that for the\nsingle-well case [1]- [3], but more difficult.\n\u2022 To test experimentally the prediction that, for small to moderate friction, the\nescape flux may grow in a step-wise manner for t <C \u00a3opt, and to study the\nproblem in a more general context, including an arbitrary potential, a pre-\nexponential factor, inter-attractor transitions in multi-well stable potentials.\nAKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work has been supported by the INTAS and by the EPSRC (UK).\nREFERENCES\n1.
