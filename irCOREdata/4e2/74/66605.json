With growing frequency, these data-\nbases are built not from regular sources containing standardized\ndata but from multiple sources containing diverse information.\nBecause these databases often contain extensive amounts of infor-\nmation about particular populations or issues, they appear to offer\nthe promise of more rigorous quantitative examination of impor-\ntant historical questions. However, they usually cannot make any\nclaim to knowledge of a complete population or representative\nsample, nor permit much regularity in the information stored, thus\nmaking quantitative analysis dif\u00aacult. How can the apparent\npromise of speci\u00aac quantitative examinations be ful\u00aalled when the\ndata available to historians can be so problematical?\nEpidemiologists and others often try to discern the causal ef-\nfects of drugs or other treatments from the analysis of observational\ndatabases by using \u201cpropensity scores\u201d to create groups of treated\nand nontreated patients who are similar in other respects. Usually\nthe data comprise observational information collected under con-\nditions over which the investigators have no control. Broadly, the\nproblems faced by epidemiologists are, in many respects, similar to\nthose encountered in historical research. Although historians have\nnot as yet taken advantage of propensity-score methods, despite\ntheir potentially wide applicability, they might well \u00aand these ob-\nservational techniques immensely helpful in the study of a variety\nof historical issues.\nJournal of Interdisciplinary History, xxxvi:2 (Autumn, 2005), 209\u2013232.\nGidon Cohen is Senior Lecturer in Politics, University of Northumbria.

It deals\nwith many of the most challenging statistical issues concerning bias\nfrom unrepresentative samples and missing data. The results indi-\ncate that, in contrast to the more extended in\u00bauence of Lenin\nSchool students elsewhere, their in\u00bauence in Britain appears\nlargely to have been con\u00aaned to a period before 1945.\nobservational studies and matching on the propensity score\nRoughly speaking, in an ideal experiment, subjects are randomly\nassigned to treatment and control groups. When the samples are\nlarge enough, random assignment balances all of the disturbing\nfactors, and any difference in outcome between the groups pre-\nsumably stems from the treatment itself. \u201cObservational studies\u201d\nof causal relationships in human populations are attempts to main-\ntain an experimental logic even though direct experimentation is\neither impossible or undesirable. In such studies, a group that has\nreceived a \u201ctreatment\u201d of some kind is compared to a \u201ccontrol,\u201d\nor \u201ccomparison,\u201d group that has not received the treatment. In\nmany observational studies, it is not practical to obtain random\nsamples.1\nBecause investigators have no control over the behavior of\ntheir subjects in these situations, they must control for naturally\noccurring systematic differences in background characteristics,\nsuch as age or sex. For example, the now-famous observational\nstudies of the relationship between mortality rates and smoking\nhad to contend with such problems as the older average age of\npipe and cigar smokers. One important method of dealing with\nsuch biases is \u201ccase matching,\u201d in which each member of a treat-\nment group is matched with a similar member of the remaining\npopulation, In the case at hand, pipe smokers could be matched\nwith the observed non-smokers and cigarette smokers who were\nclosest to them in age to establish a matched sample permitting\n210 | GIDON COHEN\n1 William G. Cochran \u201cThe Planning of Observational Studies of Human Populations,\u201d\nJournal of the Royal Statistical Society, CXX (1965) 234\u2013255; Sonja McKinlay \u201cThe Design and\nAnalysis of the Observational Study: A Review,\u201d Journal of the American Statistical Association,\nLXX (1975), 503\u2013520.\ndifferences between the treatment and comparison groups to be\nminimized.2\nObservational studies usually contain many different back-\nground variables, or covariates, that may introduce bias. Straight-\nforward attempts at matching with many covariates would be im-\npractical even with large sets of data. However, Rosembaum and\nRubin showed that use of a propensity score could remove the\nbias arising from differences in many characteristics. Individuals\u2019\npropensity scores represent the probability of them being treated\nbased on their background characteristics. A propensity score re-\nduces the entire collection of background characteristics into a sin-\ngle summary characteristic. Matching the sample on the propen-\nsity score permits differences between treatment and comparison\ngroups to be estimated in a way that re\u00baects adjustment for differ-\nences in all of the observed background characteristics.3\nFor example, smokers and non-smokers do not only differ in\nterms of age; smokers also tend to be male, to drink more alcohol,\nto exercise less, to be less educated, and to be more likely to work\nin blue-collar occupations. A proper estimate of the increased\nlikelihood of death caused directly by smoking requires a compari-\nson between smokers and non-smokers in which the only differ-\nence concerns smoking. First, the propensity of each individual to\nsmoke must be calculated\u2014that is, the probability of a particular\nperson being a smoker, given his\/her age, education, occupation,\nand alcohol consumption. These propensity scores can be used to\ncreate a matched sample; each smoker is matched with a non-\nsmoker with a similar propensity to smoke. As already mentioned,\nthe propensity score reduces the entire collection of background\ncharacteristics to a single one. Thus does matching create a balance\non all the background variables, as can be veri\u00aaed by comparing\nthe distribution gender, education, alcohol consumption, and so\non of the matched smokers and non-smokers. With these matched\nsamples, directly comparing the mortality of smokers and non-\nsmokers allows a less biased estimate of the increased health risks of\nsmoking.4\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 211\n2 Cochran, \u201cObservational Studies.\u201d\n3 Paul Rosembaum and Donald Rubin, \u201cThe Central Role of the Propensity Score in Ob-\nservational Studies for Causal Effects,\u201d Biometrika, LXX (1983), 41\u201355.\n4 JoAnne Micale Foody et al., \u201cA Propensity Analysis of Cigarette Smoking and Mortality\nIn general, these methods should be seen as a supplement to,\nrather than a replacement of, existing techniques. However, so far\nas the analysis of observational data is concerned, propensity score\nmethods are often thought to have a number of advantages over\nsuch model-based statistical analyses as linear or logistic regression.\nMost important, matching methods directly reveal the suitability\nof any particular database for answering speci\u00aac questions by di-\nrectly exposing the overlap between treatment and comparison\ngroups. Although extrapolating characteristics between a group of\nforty-year-old non-smokers and a group of seventy-year-old\nsmokers would not seem to have much to teach about the effects\nof smoking, model-based approaches would do so without warn-\ning, even without suf\u00aacient overlap between the groups. Further-\nmore, the case-matching approach does not rely on the often-\nunwarranted assumptions about the linearity or log-linearity of the\nrelationship between the covariates (such as age) and outcomes\n(such as death) that underlie model-based methods.\nThe results of propensity-score analysis have the added ad-\nvantage of being relatively straightforward to communicate to\nthose unfamiliar with quantitative techniques, even though the\nmatching process itself may be statistically complex. That it can\ndeal with the most pressing statistical issues and effect a compari-\nson between two groups without the intervention of recondite\nterminology and calculation may recommend it to those historians\nwho are not conversant, or comfortable, with quantitative ap-\nproaches.5\nA number of articles provides tutorials for the propensity-\nscore methods for bias removal; they are now widely used in epi-\ndemiology. The techniques are also increasingly employed in a\nrange of social-science disciplines, including economics and soci-\nology. They commonly assist in the analysis of large data sets, even\nin cases where the data \u201care not based on the results of carefully\nconducted randomized trials, but rather represent data collected\nthrough the observations of systems as they operate in normal\npractice.\u201d However, the observation of systems in their normal\n212 | GIDON COHEN\nWith Consideration of the Effects of Alcohol,\u201d American Journal of Cardiology, LXXXVII\n(2001), 706\u2013711.\n5 Rubin, \u201cEstimating Causal Effects from Large Data Sets Using Propensity Scores,\u201d Annals\nof Internal Medicine, CXXVII (1997), 757\u2013763.\noperation rarely produces \u201cperfect\u201d results, missing data generally\nbeing the most acute problem.6\nestimating propensity scores with missing data The esti-\nmation of propensity scores and their use in matching when data\nare incomplete is based on well-developed statistical methods that\nstress the importance of determining patterns in what is missing.\nThe proper approach depends on whether the mechanism respon-\nsible for the missing data can be ignored without introducing bias.\nMissing-data mechanisms are expendable in two situations: The\n\u00aarst involves data missing completely at random (mcar). When\neach value of a variable is equally likely to be missing, then the\nmissing data mechanism can be ignored. In this unusual situation,\ndeletion of the missing data will introduce no bias. The second,\nmore plausible, assumption that enables the mechanism to be ig-\nnored involves a situation in which the values for data are missing\nat random (mar), given the observed data. For example, people\nwith particular characteristics\u2014say, belonging to a particular oc-\ncupational class or having a particular educational background\u2014\nmay be more reluctant than others to reveal their voting prefer-\nences. The telling variables in this case may well be intrinsically re-\nlated to the (sometimes hidden) voting preference. Under the\nassumption that the missing data are mar, complete analysis needs\nto take account of the relationships between the variables to en-\nsure that statistical inferences do not introduce bias and that they\nmake ef\u00aacient use of the information available (crucial for histori-\ncal research). The assumption that the values are mar, however, is\nnot always appropriate. When values are absent in a way that de-\npends on the actual values of the missing data, the mechanisms are\ndescribed as Non-Ignorable (ni).7\nOne way to take account of the relationship between differ-\nent variables in cases of mar is to use maximum likelihood ap-\nproaches, which estimate the model that gives the maximum like-\nlihood (ml) of generating the actually observed data, as well as the\n6 Ralph B. d\u2019Agostino \u201cPropensity Score Methods for Bias Reduction in the Comparison\nof a Treatment to a Non-Randomized Control Group,\u201d Statistics in Medicine, XVII (1998),\n2265\u20132281; Rubin \u201cEstimating Causal Effects,\u201d 757.\n7 Garry King et al., \u201cAnalysing Incomplete Political Science Data: An Alternative Algo-\nrithm for Multiple Imputation,\u201d American Political Science Review, XCV (2001), 49\u201369; Rubin,\n\u201cInference and Missing Data,\u201d Biometrika, LXIII (1976); Rubin, \u201cMultiple Imputation after\n18+ Years,\u201d Journal of the American Statistical Association, CXXIV (1996), 473\u2013489.\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 213\nml expectations of missing information for each individual case in\nthe observed data. Expectation Maximization (em) algorithms are\nthe most common means of estimating such maximum likelihood\nmodels. Sometimes creating a full em estimate is not practical,\nlargely because the algorithm may be extremely slow to converge,\nespecially in cases with many terms to be estimated relative to the\nsize of the data set. Placing constraints on the model to be esti-\nmated\u2014that is, reducing the number of terms to be estimated\u2014\ncan improve convergence properties. When constraints are placed\non the interactions between variables, an Expectation Constrained\nMaximization (ecm) algorithm can generate expectations. In Anal-\nysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data, Schafer provides a clear intro-\nduction to both em and ecm algorithms. His explanation of the\ncomputational details provided the basis for the missing-data mod-\nule of the S-Plus statistical software package, which has handled\nthe calculations in this article.8\nRecent work by d\u2019Agostino and Rubin, using such computa-\ntions, shows how to estimate and use propensity scores for a treat-\nment with partially missing data. They use either em or ecm algo-\nrithms to estimate a probability of treatment (Z=1) versus control\n(Z=0), given both the observed data and the patterns of missing\ndata. After the algorithm provides an estimate of the parameters\nfor an ml model, and convergence has been reached, the model is\nused to generate probabilities of treatment, given that Z is missing,\nby running one \u00aanal E(xpectation) step of the algorithm. As\nd\u2019Agostino and Rubin recently stressed, the problem of propen-\nsity-score estimation is different from most other missing-data\nproblems, since propensity scores serve only in intermediate calcu-\nlations to balance populations.9\nFollowing this estimation, matched samples can be chosen ac-\ncording to the nearest available propensity score. Hence, the \u00aarst\ntreatment case is selected and matched to the non-treatment case\nwith the closest propensity score, and both cases are removed from\n214 | GIDON COHEN\n8 A. P. Dempster, N. M.

The process repeats until all of the subjects\nhave matches. The success of this matching in removing bias can\nbe assessed by comparing the distribution of observed data for\nboth treatment and comparison groups.10\nthe international lenin school and the communist party of\ngreat britain Situated in Moscow, and shrouded in secrecy,\nthe International Lenin School (ils) was founded in 1926 as an in-\nstrument for the \u201cBolshevization\u201d of the Comintern and its na-\ntional sections. Roughly summarized from what may be the only\nauthorized public description of the school, the ils\u2019 aims were the\nformation of a revolutionary elite; the induction of this elite into\nthe disciplines of Marxism-Leninism; its indoctrination with the\nvigilance, discipline, and commitment of the Bolsheviks; and the\nmaking of a decisive break with any lingering social-democratic\ntraditions within the communist movement. This last goal also in-\nvolved the removal of an older leadership cohort tainted by \u201cpetty\nbourgeois\u201d in\u00bauences and its replacement with trained Leninist\ncadres drawn from the core sections of the working class.11\nBetween 1926 and 1938, the school graduated about 3,000\ncommunists, most of whom were from European and American\ncommunist parties. The Communist University of Toilers of the\nEast, another Comintern-af\u00aaliated institution, catered to the ma-\njority of students from colonial countries. Both sets of students\ntook courses in working-class history, the political economy of\nimperialism, Marxist theory, and the experience of proletarian dic-\ntatorship, complemented by practical work in a Soviet economic\nenterprise. In the early days of the Lenin school, students also be-\ncame members of the Soviet Communist Party. The signi\u00aacance\nof their training in clandestine practices, sometimes dramatized as\n\u201cRed Army training,\u201d is uncertain: No doubt, this training was of\nmore immediate relevance to students from countries other than\nBritain. Students\u2019 characterizations of, and correspondence with,\nthe Party in Britain suggest that they expected to be deployed sys-\ntematically by the Party in \u201cmass\u201d work and to become its leading\nfunctionaries at national and district levels. Historians of the school\nhave described it as \u201ca long-term investment\u201d by the Comintern,\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 215\n10 D\u2019Agostino and Rubin, \u201cEstimating and Using.\u201d\n11 J.T.

It is dif\u00aacult to\nthink of any comparable attempt to shape a generation of national\npolitical leaders from a single center.12\nDue to the secrecy surrounding the ils, standard histories of\nthe Comintern and its constituent parties could contain little real\ndiscussion of the role that it played in the contentious processes of\n\u201cBolshevization\u201d and \u201cStalinization.\u201d The Comintern archives in\nMoscow, accessible since 1991, provide reasonably comprehensive\nlists and, to a lesser extent, biographical pro\u00aales for a number of\ndifferent national cohorts. However, key questions regarding the\nschool\u2019s effectiveness have yet to be fully addressed. Given that the\nstudents were selected for their potential to serve in prominent\nParty cadres, how much difference did attendance at the school\nmake to their subsequent political careers and their functions\nwithin their respective parties? Did the Comintern\u2019s long-term in-\nvestment, which was certainly substantial in \u00aanancial and other\nterms, pay the intended dividends?13\n216 | GIDON COHEN\n12 See Irina Filatova, \u201cIndoctrination or Scholarship?

Lenin School students can be traced internationally well\ninto the 1960s, exercising signi\u00aacant responsibilities either as heads\nof communist governments\u2014like Yugoslavia\u2019s Marshal Tito, Po-\nland\u2019s Wladyslaw Gomulka, and the German Democratic Repub-\nlic\u2019s Erich Honecker\u2014or as leaders of signi\u00aacant oppositional par-\nties\u2014like the general secretaries of the French and South African\ncommunist parties, Waldeck Rochet and Moses Kotane. Finland\nshows a high correlation between key Party leadership positions\nand attendance at the school. However, given the often-polarized\nnature of the literature, impressionistic observations have been at\nbest inconclusive and at worst inconsistent, even within a single\naccount. For example, although Studer seemed to describe the\nschool as meeting its formal objectives, she also reported that the\nmajority of Swiss students resigned from the Party within a decade\nof returning from the school. Though Studer attributes this defec-\ntion to a lack of \u00aatting permanent positions, the implications of\nsuch a high number of resignations for an assessment of the\nschool\u2019s success are not discussed.14\nA number of severely con\u00baicting interpretations have\nemerged regarding the school\u2019s impact on the Communist Party\nof Great Britain, ranging from little to signi\u00aacant and long-term.\nThe research for this article discovered the possibility of a more\ndistinctive pattern; the in\u00bauence of the cohort from the school ap-\npeared to decline during World War II. The opening of the ar-\nchives in Moscow and Manchester permits an investigation of this\nmatter in a rigorous, quantitative fashion. The evidence about the\nLenin School\u2019s students used for this analysis derives from bio-\ngraphical information collected in the author\u2019s initial investigation\nof the Lenin School, extended and revised by data drawn from the\nbiographical list of Lenin School students presented in Labour His-\ntory Review, which is, in some respects, more complete. Subse-\nquent data and research supply even more detailed biographical\ninformation and a number of corrections to the lists. The com-\nbined and slightly amended data provide the basis for this article.15\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 217\n14 Studer, Un parti, 234\u2013249.\n15 For the view that attendance at the School made little impact, see Andrew Thorpe,\n\u201cComintern \u2018Control\u2019 of the Communist Party of Great Britain 1920\u20131943,\u201d English Historical\nReview, CXIII (1998) 637\u2013662; Barry McLoughlin, \u201cProletarian Academics or Party Func-\nThis study assesses the speci\u00aac impact of attendance at the Le-\nnin School by comparing the careers of its students with those of a\nsimilar group of communists of the 1920s and 1930s who did not\nattend the school. The comparison group comes from the cpgb\nBiographical Database\u2014initially constructed, and subsequently\nupdated, by a team of researchers at the University of Manchester\nbetween 1999 and 2001\u2014which includes records on more than\n4,300 British communists. The database provides excellent and ex-\ntensive information about many of these individuals, including\ntheir leisure pursuits, accents, and personal appearance in addition\nto more routine dates of birth, occupations, and political activities.\nThe project draws from a wide variety of sources, with differ-\ning levels and types of information: more than 150 life-history in-\nterviews with former Party members; short autobiographies col-\nlected by the cpgb, like other communist parties, starting from the\n1930s; nominations to positions within the Party; published and\nunpublished biographies and memoirs; information derived from\ncorrespondence between the cpgb and Moscow; and personal ar-\nchives\/correspondence. The sources used for each individual\u2019s en-\ntry were recorded systematically in the database in considerable\ndetail. All of the information discovered about every documented\nmember of the Communist Party entered the database. As a result,\nthe database contains an unparalleled collection of biographical in-\nformation about British political activists of this period, creating\nthe potential for quantitative investigation of many historical ques-\ntions relating to the cpgb.\nHowever, two discrete problems prevent a straightforward\nstatistical analysis of this data. First, the individuals about whom\nsubstantial information is available are extremely unlikely to have\nbeen representative of British communists. In general, the com-\nmunists described in any one source were probably from the upper\nechelons, or atypical in other ways. Furthermore, even though the\nuse of sources was systematic, the choice of sources was less so,\nre\u00baecting speci\u00aac areas of interest\u2014such as the ils. The sheer\n218 | GIDON COHEN\ntionaries? Irish Communists at the International Lenin School, Moscow, 1927\u20131937,\u201d Saothar,\nXXII (1997), 63\u201379. For the opposite view, see Alan Campbell et al., \u201cThe International Le-\nnin School: A Response to Cohen and Morgan,\u201d Twentieth Century British History, XV (2004),\n51\u201376; Cohen and Morgan (2002) \u201c\u2018Stalin\u2019s Sausage Machine\u201d; McIlroy et al., \u201cForging the\nFaithful,\u201d 121\u2013124. The most signi\u00aacant differences surround alternative de\u00aanitions of such\nterms as full-time party worker.\nnumber of these sources, with their vastly divergent orientations\nand emphases, only compounded the dif\u00aaculty of constructing an\nimage of a representative British communist. Second, substantial\nevidence is missing from the database. The information about a\nconsiderable number of British communists is fragmentary, and\nonly enough for a complete pro\u00aale in a small proportion of cases.\nFrom a statistical perspective, the drawback is that both unrepre-\nsentative samples and missing data create bias; quantitative esti-\nmates derived from the database could vary signi\u00aacantly from the\ntrue (unknown) values in the underlying population.16\ncreating matched samples for lenin school students De-\nspite the problematical nature of the available data, propensity-\nscore methods allow a quantitative investigation of the Lenin\nSchool\u2019s impact on the British Communist Party via a comparison\nof the achievements of its students with those of a similar compari-\nson group.\nThe assumption behind observational studies based on\nmatched populations is that if the treatment and comparison\ngroups are balanced in all of the relevant background covariates,\ntheir differences must stem from their respective treatments.\nHowever, the way in which historical sources de\u00aane the individu-\nals recorded in such documentary sources as the cpgb biographical\ndatabase normally renders this assumption invalid. For one thing,\nthe database includes many people who were ineligible to attend\nthe Lenin School. For obvious reasons, those known not to have\nbeen members of the cpgb in 1926 would not be suitable matches\nfor the students who attended the Lenin School in that year. Any\nindividual failing to meet this condition in any year was excluded\nfrom the analysis of that year. More signi\u00aacant, many sources will\nhave been constructed after the treatment has occurred, or even\nafter the outcome of interest has transpired. In this case, a relation-\nship between an outcome being measured and the likelihood of\nbeing included in a particular source will often exist. Since these\nsources affect the composition of the database and are related to\noutcomes, estimates of the prevalence of the outcome in both\ntreatment and comparison groups will be biased.\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 219\n16 For an overview of these issues, see Cohen, \u201cMissing, Biased and Unrepresentative: The\nQuantitative Analysis of Multi-Source Biographical Data,\u201d Historical Methods, XXXV (2002),\n166\u2013176.\nAs an example, imagine the database as constructed solely\nfrom a list of Britons who died \u00aaghting in the Spanish Civil War.\nIn this case, regardless of how closely the comparison group\nmatches the students in background characteristics, since the en-\ntire comparison group died before 1939, none will have been\nprominent in the Party after 1945. If, instead, the comparison\ngroup were to consist only of those known from lists of the post-\nwar cpgb Central Committee, every member would appear as\nprominent in the postwar party. The bias in these sources is glar-\ningly obvious. In most other sources compiled after the event,\nsimilar, although less extreme biases, will be present. For example,\nthe date at which a source was compiled may have implications for\nan individual\u2019s behavior. The extensive autobiographical \u00aales on\nBritish Communists stored at the Labour History Archive and\nStudy Centre, Manchester, complied since 1942, would include\nonly those communists of the 1920s and 1930s who chose to re-\nmain in the cpgb. Whatever the nature of these biases, and in\nwhatever different directions they point, simply adding the popu-\nlations found from such sources together gives no guarantee that\nthe biases will be eliminated.17\nThese problems can be mitigated by restricting the sources\nused to de\u00aane the population from which the comparison group\nderives to those predating the selection of students for the Lenin\nSchool. This proviso does not create a representative sample of\ncommunists from the period in question, but it testi\u00aaes to the im-\nportance of ensuring that the reasons why certain groups might be\nmentioned in a source has nothing to do with events that occurred\nafter the Lenin School students were selected. Thus, at least in\nprinciple, the ways in which the population is atypical can be cap-\ntured in a set of variables that relates solely to the period prior to\nenrollment in the school. That this population overrepresents\nthose who belonged to the cpgb Central Committee during the\n1940s is inescapable, because, for example, active communists of\nthe 1930s were both more likely to be recorded in contemporary\nsources and more likely to be prominent during the 1940s. How-\never, this study\u2019s \u00aandings assume that those who went onto the\ncpgb Central Committee during the 1940s are not overrepresen-\n220 | GIDON COHEN\n17 William Rust, Britons in Spain: The History of the British Battalion of the XVth International\nBrigade (London, 1939).\nted given the variables being measured, such as communist activity\nduring the 1930s.\nRestricting the population will lead to unbiased estimates of\noutcomes only if the comparison of the groups balances on an ap-\npropriate set of variables. This condition depends on a theoretical\nmodel of what factors distinguished Lenin School students from\nother communists or what factors were important in predicting\nthe attainment of leadership positions within the cpgb. As in most\nareas of historical research, previous attempts at statistical investi-\ngation are nonexistent; any such model must be based on a formal-\nization of qualitative evidence. Precise instructions from the\nComintern about who was worthy of being sent to the ils varied,\nand the loosely followed criteria frequently led to complaints that\n\u201calmost all parties fail[ed] to ful\u00aal completely ECCI\u2019s [Executive\nCommittee of the Comintern] directives on the requirements ex-\npected of everyone entering the school.\u201d However, the principles\nremained fairly constant, also providing a reasonable indication of\nwho might have been expected to form the next generation of\ncommunist leaders.\nAs Studer summarized the quali\u00aacations, the students were to\nbe of working-class or peasant origin, in perfect health, aged no\nmore than thirty-\u00aave, members of the Communist Party or\nYoung Communist League for at least a year, and proven in some\nform of class struggle. Other sources, such as the testimony of the\nstudents, state that factors, such as gender, also played a part in se-\nlection to both the Lenin School and leadership positions within\nthe Communist Party. Although selection on these factors may\nhave been imperfectly ful\u00aalled, the Lenin School students were\ncertainly not typical communists in these respects.18\nFor various technical reasons, a model that covers all of the\npotential dif\u00aaculties is impossible to create. Based on the Comin-\ntern criteria, this study gives priority to four factors that appear to\nhave been critical in the attainment of leadership positions within\nthe cpgb: level of previous communist activity, gender, class, and\ngeneration. Table 1 contains the full set of variables used to repre-\nsent these concepts and to estimate the propensity score.

Because what the students were\ndoing immediately before attending the Lenin school is signi-\n\u00aacant, the calculations take this date into account. In order to cre-\nate data suitable for matching students with non-students, separate\ncalculations on each of the variables were performed for every year\nin which students were sent to the Lenin School. Non-students\nwere considered as potential matches for students according to\nindividual data at the time when students were about to enter\nthe ils.19\n222 | GIDON COHEN\n19 Balancing all of the factors did not prove possible because no systematic information was\navailable about certain factors, such as state of health. For other factors, such as prior non-\ncommunist political activity or trade union activity, about which missing data was more likely\nto mask a negative response, the assumption that data were mar was unreasonable.\nTable 1 Covariates Contributing to the Estimation of the Propensity Score\nfactor variable description\ncoding (for\ncategorical data)\nGender Sex Sex 0-Female\n1-Male\nRecord of\ncommunist\nactivity\n(see also\nGeneration)\nCPAct Highest level of\nCPGB activity\nattained\n1-Local\n2-District\n3-National\n4-International\nCPActYear Highest level of\ncurrent CPGB\nactivity\n1-Local\n2-District\n3-National\n4-International\nGeneration JoinCP Date of Joining\nCPGB\nDecadeJoin Date of Joining\nCPGB\nIn decades\nDOB Date of Birth\nDecadeBirth Date of Birth In decades\nClass OccClass Occupational class\nEducation Highest level of\nformal education\n1-Elemenatry\/Primary\n2-Secondary\n3-Higher\/Further\nMuch of the data may be described as ordinal\u2014for example,\nthe hierarchy of positions within communist organizations from\nlocal, through district and national, to international levels. The\nmissing-data techniques used in this article make no provision for\nthe direct inclusion of ordinal data. However, as King et al. rec-\nommend for situations in which the data distribution is (or can be\ntransformed to be) approximately normal, \u201cordinal variables\nshould be coded to be as close to an interval scaling as information\nindicates.\u201d The occupational data in this article was coded in ac-\ncordance with ilo\u2019s International Standard Classi\u00aacation of Occu-\npations (ISCO-88). This occupational information was combined\nwith other evidence about employment status, roughly indicating\nwhether individuals were employees, supervisors, managers, or\nself-employed proprietors, to determine a standard measure of so-\ncial class\u2014one of the \u00aave groups (one subdivided) until recently\nused by the British government as an of\u00aacial classi\u00aacation. Indi-\nviduals were assigned to the occupational class in which they had\nspent the most time until the date under consideration. Since this\noccupational data is distributed in an approximately normal fash-\nion throughout the cpgb data, it merits treatment as continuous.\nThe other nominal data in the data set was distributed in such a\nway that it could not be considered approximately normal and had\nto be treated as categorical data.20\nAs previous studies have noted, one major problem with\nprosopographical data is its lack of precision, especially with re-\ngards to dates. On the cpgb Biographical Database, a date of birth\nmight be recorded exactly\u2014as, for example, 20\/10\/1892\u2014or\nmuch less precisely\u2014as, for example, 1901\u20133, early 1890s, 1890s,\nand so on. To restrict the study only to exact birth dates, or at least\nbirth years, would ignore the substantial amounts of \u201cfuzzy\u201d infor-\nmation in the database and suggest greater uncertainty than is actu-\nally the case. In order to overcome this problem about dates, the\nstudent and comparison groups are balanced on both exact dates as\na continuous variable and speci\u00aaed date ranges as a categorical\nvariable.21\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 223\n20 King et al., \u201cAnalysing Incomplete Political Science Data,\u201d 49.

Given the\nratio of cases to necessary parameters in a full model, the em algo-\nrithm was inappropriate. Instead, a constrained maximization us-\ning the ecm algorithm was speci\u00aaed. This model included all one-\nway and two-way interactions on the categorical variables, but did\nnot include three-way or higher-level interactions. Once the ecm\nalgorithm had converged, the expected value of the attendance at\nthe Lenin School was calculated from the parameters of the\nmodel. Separate estimates of the propensity score were obtained\nfor each intake to the ils. Each student was matched to the non-\nstudent with the nearest available propensity score from the un-\nmatched population in a particular year until the matched sample\nwas complete.\nassessing the bias reduction The relative success of an esti-\nmated propensity-score model can be assessed by comparing the\nbalance on the observed values of the covariates\u2013in this case, the\nbackground covariates for students and matched populations. For\ncontinuous covariates, the standardized difference in means was\nthe measure of success\u2014zero indicating a perfect balance\u2014\nwhereas for categorical covariates, it was the available case propor-\ntion for each value of the variable\u2014a value identical to the student\ngroup indicating a perfect match. The extent of the bias reduction\nachieved by the propensity-score matching is evident in a compar-\nison of these results to those involving a randomly selected sample\nof the database meeting the logical criteria for matching. The bal-\nance on continuous covariates is shown in Figure 1 and the bal-\nance for categorical covariates in Figure 2.22\nStudies in medical and epidemiological literatures often fea-\nture propensity-score methods alongside the results from random-\nized experimental studies. In such cases, the existence of alterna-\ntive quantitative methods of data collection and investigation,\nwhich may have demonstrably less bias, requires acceptance of\nonly small levels of bias. Both theoretical and applied studies tend\n224 | GIDON COHEN\n22 The standardized-percentage difference is de\u00aaned as the mean difference between\ngroups as a percentage of the standard deviation {100 22 2( ) \/ [( ) \/ ]x x s sp t p t\u2212 + }.\nto suggest that a standardized difference in continuous covariates\nof less than 10 percent can be considered small. However, any as-\nsessment of bias reduction is a matter of judgment, dependent on\nthe alternatives available. In historical studies based on multi-\nsource biographical data, two factors suggest the possible need for\ngreater toleration of bias: (1) the scarcity of much historical data,\nwhich has an inescapably negative effect on accuracy, and (2) the\nlimitation on the types of investigation that data collection may\nimpose. Whenever these conditions apply, particularly the \u00aarst,\nhistorical studies may well have to accept a greater toleration of\nbias. Both factors, however, suggest the need to consider the con-\ngruence of results with \u00aandings of other, perhaps more qualitative,\nforms of investigation.23\nFigures 1 and 2 show that bias reduction was most obviously\neffective with regard to dates of birth and dates of joining the\ncpgb, both of which showed the greatest initial bias. Bias on date\nof joining was reduced to below the 10 percent of the standardized\ndifference level considered small in epidemiological studies. Bias\nwas also largely eliminated in level of past cp activity, the variable\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 225\n23 D\u2019Agostino and Rubin, \u201cEstimating and Using,\u201d 756\u2013758; S-L.T.

Despite the overall success of\nthe propensity-score model in reducing bias in this study, and the\nconcession that different levels of residual bias may be acceptable\nin some historical studies, the areas where substantial bias remains\nare important to bear in mind. Any differences in outcome be-\ntween the student and matched sample may be explained by\nslightly different social origins.\nresults The creation of matched populations makes the presen-\ntation and analysis of the Lenin School\u2019s impact on the careers of\nBritish communists comparatively simple. By the 1930s, member-\nship in the executive committee was probably the best indicator of\nstatus within the Party, and it was consistently associated with\nleading positions at the Party newspaper and in the Party\u2019s largest\ndistricts. Tests were also run on the data to see whether any pat-\ntern involving Party organizers and secretaries was discernible in\nany of the districts, including the smaller ones without representa-\ntion on the executive committee.\nThe simplest way to examine the trajectories is through\ngraphical presentation. Figure 3 shows the numbers of ils and\n226 | GIDON COHEN\nFig. 2 Observed Proportions of Categorical Covariates for Students,\nMatched and Random Samples\nmatched groups on the executive committee over time. Figure 4\nshows the patterns in relation to the numbers of district organizers.\nDifferences are in evidence, both with respect to the clarity of the\npatterns and the years. However, in both cases, a possible trajec-\ntory is suggested \u00aarst in the 1930s when more Lenin School stu-\ndents seem to have occupied higher positions within the cpgb and\nlater in the postwar period when the trajectory for both students\nand the matched groups appear to have been approximately the\nsame.\nAlthough it provides a useful starting point, this graphical\nanalysis should be approached with considerable caution. First, al-\nthough the data are certainly informative, the imprecision with re-\nspect to dates, particularly relating to district secretaries, means that\n\u00aagures for particular years cannot be regarded as de\u00aanitive. Sec-\nond, the data set is not large enough to enable questions about dis-\ntinct periods to be addressed as neatly as the graphical presentation\nmight suggest. Third, the presentation of aggregate \u00aagures for\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 227\nFig. 3 ils and Matches on Executive Committee, 1929\u20131957\neach year masks a considerably faster turnover of ils students than\nof matched samples in both the executive committee and the posi-\ntion of district organizer\/secretary. Finally, any analysis dependent\non inspecting graphical differences is prone to dif\u00aaculty. Rarely\nwill two samples ever produce exactly the same results, and it can\nbe dif\u00aacult to determine whether different trajectories are due to\nexpected \u00bauctuations or whether the differences are greater than\nwould be expected by chance alone.\nA more rigorous alternative, which circumvents these dif-\n\u00aaculties, is to compare directly the number of the students and\nmatched samples who eventually achieved positions of promi-\nnence within the Communist Party. Table 2 shows the respective\nnumbers elected to the executive committee after graduation dur-\ning the period to 1945 and later during the postwar years. Table 3\nshows the number of matched samples who worked as district or-\nganizers or secretaries during the same periods. Whether atten-\ndance at the Lenin School was related to the attainment of a\nprominent position can be determined by testing the hypothesis\nthat no relationship existed.\nInspection of tables 2 and 3 would seem to indicate substantial\ndifferences between the student and matched populations during\n228 | GIDON COHEN\nFig. 4 ils and Matched Samples as District Secretaries\/Organizers,\n1926\u20131957\nthe early period but little difference during the postwar years. The\npatterns can be investigated more rigorously by using a chi-square\ntest. For example, the chi-square test for the executive committee\nduring the period to 1945 gives the probability that a difference as\ngreat as 20 of 159 students and 9 of 159 matched cases would have\noccurred if cases had been randomly assigned from 318 individuals\nwith 29 on the executive committee. The chi-square result of\n0.041 is statistically signi\u00aacant at the 0.05 level in the sense; that\nstudents\u2019 representation on the executive committee would ex-\nceed that of matched samples to this extent by chance alone has\nless than a 5 percent probability.\nThe results for the post-1945 period suggest that chance could\nwell explain the small difference between the two groups (eight\nstudents versus nine individuals from the matched population) in\nelection to the executive committee at that time. The results for\nservice by members of the two groups as district organizers and\nsecretaries show the same pattern, but in an even stronger fash-\nion\u2014the difference being signi\u00aacant at the 0.01 level (a less than\n1 percent likelihood that the differences are due only to chance).\nIn the post-1945 period, identical numbers of students and\nmatched samples were district secretaries. Hence, the \u00aandings\ngenerally present a consistent picture. During an initial period,\nlasting approximately until the end of World War II, attendance at\nPROPENSITY SCORES AND THE LENIN SCHOOL | 229\nTable 2 Number of Students and Matched Samples on the Executive Com-\nmittee during Two Time Periods\nstudent (n = 159) matched (n = 159) chi-square\n1926\u20131945 20 9 0.041\nPost-1945 8 9 0.808\nTable 3 Number of Student and Matched-Samples District Organizers\/\nSecretaries in Two Time Periods\nstudent (n = 159) matched (n = 159) chi-square\n1926\u20131945 23 7 0.003\nPost-1945 5 5 1\nthe Lenin School signi\u00aacantly increased an individual\u2019s chance of\nachieving a position of prominence within the cpgb. After this pe-\nriod, however, attendance at the ils appears to have had no\nsigni\u00aacant effect on the attainment of these positions.\nIn a context as controlled and politicized as the selection of\nCommunist Party leadership, these surprising results about the\nlimited duration of ils students\u2019 prominence have signi\u00aacant\nrami\u00aacations concerning the movement. At the most basic level,\nthey suggest that the training provided, with its heavy emphasis on\ntheory and \u201cconspiracy,\u201d was not well tailored to the more open\ncampaigning requirements of a legal communist organization like\nthe cpgb. Traditionally, however, the leadership of each Comin-\ntern section was seen as a \u201cself-perpetuating clique of obedient\nleaders\u201d whose prior political conditioning gradually superseded\nthe continuous direction of the Comintern as the instrument of\nRussian control: \u201cLike the Duke of Newcastle\u2019s bishops, they\ncould be expected to worship their maker.\u201d In reality, the decay of\nthe Comintern\u2019s formal structures after the mid-1930s left no al-\nternative mechanisms to secure the positions of these \u201ctested\nhenchmen\u201d within the Party apparatus. At a national level, con-\nsiderable powers of patronage devolved to general secretaries or\nsecretariats; they acquired the capacity to advance, block, or divert\ncareers without much interference from an external authority. In\nBritain, graduates of the Lenin School may have been identi\u00aaed\nwith what came to be regarded as the School\u2019s \u201csectarianism.\u201d\nOlder Party leaders lacking a formal Moscow training may\nhave regarded them as potential challengers. A \u201cself-perpetuating\nclique\u201d of British communists, formed prior to the Lenin School,\nmay have begun to promote its own recruits from the 1930s,\nseemingly at the expense of those whom the Communist Interna-\ntional had been formally grooming for leadership roles.24\nIn the past few years prosopography, the study of collective biog-\nraphy, has undergone a resurgence.

Relying en-\ntirely on qualitative judgment to gauge patterns within such large\ndata sets is an invitation to inaccuracy; collective biography\nbene\u00aats from some form of statistical analysis.25\nOne possible approach is to treat the collective-biographical\ndata as a regular, complete probability sample of the population as\na whole. At best, this strategy involves the explicit, and risky, as-\nsumptions that a large sample can substitute for a representative\nsample and that the patchy nature of the data can be ignored. The\nbiases found in the cpgb Biographical Database data\u2014concerning\nboth the individuals described in the sources and the varying types\nof information about them provided by the sources\u2014are the same\nas those in almost every other complex biographical database.\nGiven the obvious problems entailed, many scholars believe that\nthe only alternative to assuming regular, complete, and representa-\ntive samples is to reject the possibility of any systematic statistical\ninvestigation of collective biographical data. One aim of this arti-\ncle is to suggest that techniques taken from scienti\u00aac observational\nstudies, such as propensity-score case matching, can help historians\nto circumvent these unsatisfactory alternatives.26\nPropensity-score matching is not a magical technique for his-\ntorical databases; problems can arise at many stages. The method\nrequires a relatively large initial data set containing information\nabout a substantial group of individuals. In the case examined in\nthis article, the database had the requisite background information,\nsuch as prior political activity and educational history. The indi-\nviduals under examination could be identi\u00aaed as either \u201ctreated\u201d\nor \u201cuntreated\u2019 according to their having attended the Interna-\ntional Lenin School or not. They also could be recorded as having\nexperienced a measurable outcome, election (or non-election) to\nthe cpgb executive committee.

The step taken herein was to re-\nstrict the population to those individuals who appeared in sources\ncreated before a particular date or event during their lifetime. The\ngreatest limitation of this methodology is that bias can be removed\nonly from background factors that have been explicitly considered\nand measured. Furthermore, historians who use case-matching\nmethods, unlike scientists who use them, have no recourse to ran-\ndomized experimental methods. They will have to remain sensi-\ntive to the \u00aandings from other, often more qualitative, forms of\ninvestigation.\nDespite these issues, techniques borrowed from scienti\u00aac ob-\nservational studies have great potential for historical research. Pro-\npensity-score techniques have proven their worth. They can deal\nrigorously with such problems of central concern to historians as\nunrepresentative samples and missing data. Methods, based on the\ncomparison of matched samples, may also be statistically more ap-\npropriate to matters of causation than, say, regression, particularly\nbecause they directly ask questions about the suitability of the data.\nThe logic of comparing otherwise similar groups who have under-\ngone different \u201ctreatment\u201d is relatively easy to grasp, and the\nresults of the matching and the \u00aanal comparisons, and the opera-\ntional details of the methods, need not be prohibitively compli-\ncated to understand. Recent developments in prosopography and\nhistorical computing have suggested, but too infrequently deliv-\nered, a wider application of quantitative methods. The techniques\ndeveloped in scienti\u00aac observational studies provide one possible\nroute to realising this potential.\n232 | GIDON COHEN\n"}
