We propose a \nmove from a largely firm-centric focus; on profit maximization and shareholder value; to a broader \nsocietal and environmental view. We see the educational context as the locus for initiating such a shift. \nHowever, we see obstacles within the canon of mainstream IB textbooks, with their focus on \nexposition of normative models of managerial action, illustrated by case studies of successful \nmultinational enterprises (MNEs). Whilst we acknowledge their incorporation of critical issues, we \nview the lack of substantive critical reflection on the wider implications of IB activity as underpinned \nby an implicit assumption of the \u201egood\u201f of IB. We posit that the normative structure of mainstream \ntexts militates against students understanding the full range of possible futures for IB practice, and \nagainst developing the capability to cope with situations of uncertainty and ambiguity. Seeking to \npromote a critical pedagogy that accommodates consideration of both mainstream approaches and \ncritical responses to these, we propose one approach to teaching and learning about IB futures that is \nbased upon development of what we term \u201ecritical scenario method\u201f. This offers a basis for active \ninvestigation of complex problems in the \u201ereal\u201f world from a range of perspectives, beyond that of \nprofit maximization. We provide a worked, case example of our new method and demonstrate how it \nwill enhance perceptions\/understandings of involved and affected actors\u201f interests and their likely \n(re)actions as a particular scenario unfolds. The theoretical grounding for this approach is based upon \ncontemporary social science interpretation of the Aristotelian concept of phron\u0113sis, or \u201epractical \nwisdom\u201f. \n \nKeywords \nInternational business, critical pedagogy, phron\u0113sis, critical scenario method \n  \n1. Introduction  \n \nIn this paper, we look to the future of international business (IB) and call for a fundamental \nchange in how IB managers determine organisational objectives and what criteria they use in \naddressing complex organisational issues. Specifically, we see a need for them to consider the \nconsequences of their decision making in the context of broad society and environment, rather \nthan within a narrow firm-centric view. We propose that the foundations of such a \nfundamental shift must be laid at an early stage in managerial development. As such, we call \nfor challenge to what we see as a normative form of IB education underpinned by the canon \nof \u201emainstream\u201f1 IB textbooks. We consider that the content of these texts, even where \naddressing critical issues, is set within a \u201ebounded rationality\u201f [1] of profit maximization and \nshareholder value. Here, we present an alternative, discursive model of engagement with \nextant textbooks through application of scenario method. Scenario method enables an opening \nup of consideration of multiple possible and plausible futures. Extending the critical and \nreflective possibilities of the approach, in the context of a critical pedagogy of IB education, \nwe propose interrogation of the consequences of different courses of action that the scenarios \nmight elicit through application of contemporary social science interpretation of the \nAristotelian concept of phron\u0113sis, or practical wisdom. Specifically, we consider development \nof a \u201ecritical scenario method\u201f informed by phronetic social inquiry, as proposed by Flyvbjerg \n[2] in his text, Making Social Science Matter. \n In order to clarify our transition from a normative pedagogy to a critically reflective \nmodel that accommodates multiple perspectives, we first elaborate our problematization of \nthe normative model of IB education. Thereafter, we consider both the possibilities for a \ncritical pedagogy of IB, and the limitations and dangers of a purely critical approach in the \n 3 \nclassroom context. We then outline how we see the application of scenario method as opening \nup the possibility of considering multiple futures of IB, which are likely to provide both \nsupport for and challenge to the evinced certainties of normative models. Thereafter, we move \nto discuss application of the principles of phron\u0113sis in order to develop a critical analytic \nframework for interrogation of the scenario storylines from multiple perspectives. Here, we \nconsider the consequences of different courses of action in terms of winners and losers, and of \npower structures inherent in business and society. We illustrate the potential application of the \nproposed \u201ecritical scenario method\u201f by presentation of an illustrative example based upon a \ncase drawn from one of the mainstream texts [3]. Finally, we offer conclusions on the \nimplications of the proposed approach, both for IB education and for more critical thinking in \nthe contemporary business and social context \u2013 the kind of thinking which will enable change \nof the current paradigm towards building a sustainable model of IB practice in the future. \n \n2. Problematizing international business pedagogy \n \nThe present model of education underpinned by the canon of IB textbooks presents a world \nview in which certain \u201efactors make the pursuit of international business mandatory\u201f [4, \np.700]. These factors include attaining \u201ehigh profits\u201f, ensuring \u201esurvival of the firm\u201f and \n\u201ecompet(ing) more successfully with foreign firms\u201f (p. 700). How business should achieve \nthese ends is by and large explained by reference to examples and case studies of \u201esuccess\u201f of \nmultinational enterprises (MNEs). Whilst these case studies are accompanied by discussion \nquestions, which may be referred to as \u201ecritical\u201f [3], we posit that reflection by the student is \nlikely to be framed by the dominant assumptions outlined above, whereby the questions invite \ndichotomous choices between \u201eright\u201f and \u201ewrong\u201f, or \u201eyes\u201f and \u201eno\u201f. \nThe IB textbooks are not silent about critical issues, such as environmental pollution \nor corruption that are the subject of debate in contemporary society. Additionally, there is \nreference to losers from, and protests against forms of IB and globalization [3, pp. 4-5]. \nHowever, we argue that the emphasis of the texts is on how, \u201e(f)or business, \n(globalization\/internationalisation) has produced many opportunities. Firms can expand their \nrevenues by selling around the world and\/or reduce their costs by producing in nations where \nkey inputs, including labor, are cheap\u201f (p. 5). Where critical issues are discussed, they are \ngenerally seen as \u201eethical dilemmas\u201f to be addressed in management decision making [5], \nrather than as challenges to the very nature of IB. As a result, we consider that the mainstream \ndiscourse excludes consideration of people as individuals; rather, presenting them as either \n(aspiring) managers, or as (potential) customers of the international business organization. \nThe limitations of an approach to management education that seeks to deliver \ngeneralized models of managerial action have long been recognized [6, 7], and we concur \nwith those [8] who see the need for more innovative, trans-disciplinary and integrative forms \nof teaching and learning. We consider that the current predominant model of IB education \nmilitates against students\u201f and aspiring managers\u201f appreciation and understanding of the full \nrange of extra-organizational, social and environmental impacts of IB, and of the conflicts \ninherent in pursuing IB practices in accordance with the principles of profit maximisation and \nshareholder return. To us, the search for a different approach to IB pedagogy is necessitated, \nabove all, by the primary goal of reframing IB as a discipline of knowledge in order to \ninfluence the future of IB practice.  \nAt present, across the world, \u201ethere are many disempowered and marginalised groups \nwho are adversely affected by corporate activity yet unable to participate in any \u201cstakeholder \ndialogue\u201d\u201f [9, p.33]. The model of IB education promoted by mainstream textbooks does not \naim to equip (aspiring) managers in the ability to recognise the whole range of global and \nlocal consequences of IB practices; nor does it develop in them the will to formulate \n 4 \norganisational objectives so that the satisfaction of multiple stakeholder interests, rather than \nthe firm\u201fs financial criteria would become the \u201eultimate test of corporate performance\u201f [10, \np.80]. We see such a shift towards a different paradigm of IB education as necessary in the \ncontext of a range of contemporary phenomena in which IB plays an important part, such as: \nthe current global economic crisis, inequality and poverty within and between societies, \nclimate change, resource depletion and military conflicts. As academics and educators \nworking in the field of IB, we consider our role in creating an impact on IB through \ndeveloping a model of education that will conceptually move away from prioritising profit \nmaximisation and shareholder interests. Such a model will define the essential purpose of the \nfirm based on a preoccupation with the \u201esocial\u201f rather than the \u201ecorporate\u201f. We believe that \nthe emergence of a paradigm of IB practice rooted in the principles of ecological, economic \nand social sustainability is possible. However, it requires the kind of education that will \nprepare (aspiring) managers to engage in building an alternative future of IB. \nThe approach that we propose challenges the validity of both the content and process \nof a mainstream approach to teaching [11]. Through interrogating the day-to-day practices of \nfirms and managers, it problematizes the taken-for-granted assumptions of the IB canon, \nsurfaces issues of power and ideology, and of race, gender and class. In addition, it permits \nvoice to those who are normally excluded from the discourse of IB education, other than as \npossible objects of attention in attaining goals of profit maximization and shareholder value. \nHowever, it does not set out to deliberately undermine the mainstream and to supplant it with \nsome radical alternative vision. Rather, it facilitates students\u201f own elucidation of multiple \nperspectives on issues in IB, enabling them to understand their origins and impacts in relation \nto each other, and to develop awareness of their possible consequences for a range of involved \nand affected parties over time.  \n \n3. Applying scenario method as action learning on alternative IB futures  \n \nThe canon of IB textbooks draws heavily upon the strategic management approach for \nanalysis of the international business environment [3, 4, 12, 13]. However, as Burt et al. [14] \npoint out, the strategy textbooks themselves, generally, \u201eare not providing sufficient support \nand guidance for managers to help them analyze and understand their environment\u201f [14, p.74]. \nThey argue \u2013 as we do for IB texts \u2013 that most strategy texts are predicated upon a rationality \nthat advocates the application of generic models in order to gain an objective knowledge of \nthe business environment. The authors propose application of scenario method as a mode of \nstrategic thinking that moves the focus from retrospective sense-making, based upon analysis \nof past success or failure \u2013 as in case study analysis \u2013 to prospective sense-making through \ninvestigating a range of possible and plausible futures. \nThe approach of challenging unquestioning acceptance of the content of IB textbooks \nby facilitating alternative readings of the case studies and invoking critical reflection on their \nlimitations has previously been outlined [15]. Whilst this technique might be appropriate for \nundergraduate students with limited experience of business, we posit an alternative approach \nto IB teaching and learning for postgraduate, post-experience students through application of \nscenario method. This approach will engage students in investigating complex issues in IB, \nfirst, through engaging in alternative readings of the case studies as presented, then \ndeveloping scenarios for a range of possible and plausible futures that might emerge from \nthem. We suggest that development of these scenarios must take account of the full range of \n\u201edriving forces\u201f [16] that impact the core business issue, of all involved and affected actors \nwithin them, and, most importantly, of their global social and environmental impacts and \nconsequences. \n 5 \nThe scenario approach that we adopt as the basis for our methodological development \nis that proffered by van der Heijden et al. [16, 17, 18], which is widely reported in academic \nliterature, both in terms of its success in provoking organizational change [17] and in relation \nto the problems that can arise when powerful actors militate against change [18]. In addition, \nits employment as an educational resource in the MBA classroom has been evaluated [19]. In \nthe latter context, it is shown to be effective in moving the locus of thinking on the nature of \nthe present from the past to the future, and from a search for certainty to an acceptance of \nuncertainty and ambiguity. It also repositions learning from being primarily an individual \nactivity to being a group activity that can bring together individuals with a range of national, \ncultural, social and gender identities. Within a group learning context, it presents the \nopportunity for opening up dialogue between members in order to elicit understanding and \ninterchange between their different world-views as part of the learning process [19]. \nApplication of a scenario based approach to engagement with extant IB cases is likely \nto lead to development of at least one scenario that represents a continuation of the trajectory \nfrom past to present; the scenario that might derive from application of the tools for analysis \npresented within the IB texts in the classroom, or from \u201ebusiness as usual\u201f thinking in the \ncontext of practice. However, it is also likely to produce scenarios that present an \n\u201eorganizational jolt\u201f [20] through indicating possible, plausible and often radical \ndiscontinuities to this trajectory. Individual scenarios are not, in themselves, of value as \npredictions of some future.  Rather, as a set, they offer pointers to the directions in which it \nmight unfold, provide tools for testing the robustness of existing strategies and assessing \nproposed ones, and, most crucially, open up thinking on different ways of understanding the \npresent. \n \n4. The role of phronetic inquiry in critical scenario method \n \nOriginating in Aristotle\u201fs Nicomachean Ethics [21], the concept of phron\u0113sis has been \ndiscussed more recently in the fields of education [22], organization studies [23, 24] and \nbroader social science [2, 25]. Aristotle wrote of phron\u0113sis as the ability of \u201eman (sic) to be \nable to deliberate about what is good and advantageous for himself\u201f and to be \u201ecapable of \naction with regard to things that are good or bad for man\u201f [21, p.150]. Flyvbjerg [2] develops \na framework for phronetic social inquiry by interrogating different possible options for action \nthrough consideration of four \u201evalue rational\u201f questions, namely: \n \n Where are we going? \n Is this development desirable? \n What, if anything, should we do about it? \n Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? \n \nIn the context of problem identification and analysis in the world of IB, we argue that \nthe \u201ewe\u201f comprises not just the members of the IB firm and its customers, but all involved and \naffected parties. These include workers in home and host countries, within the MNE and its \nvarious sub-contractors and suppliers, families and friends who are dependent upon them for \ntheir own existence, and future generations who must bear the social, economic and \nenvironmental cost legacy of IB activity in the present. Building upon the philosophical \nframework of Flyvbjerg\u201fs questions within the classroom context, we offer the possibility of a \nprocess by which the voices, values and beliefs of multiple affected parties can be brought to \nbear on complex and ambiguous IB problems within a democratic conversation, through \napplication of scenario method. Our approach aims to take advantage of the rigour of scenario \n 6 \nthinking and, rather than using it in a seemingly value-free manner, to incorporate an ethical \ndimension into the scenario method. \nBy including an ethical dimension and consideration of a range of involved and \naffected parties, through interrogating our subject area using Flyvbjerg\u201fs framework for \nphronetic inquiry, we see development of the critical scenario method as commensurate with \napplication of critical stakeholder method. Such an approach incorporates a broad view of \nstakeholders, one that sees them \u201eas individuals, human beings\u2026 moral beings\u201f 26, p.411] \nand that includes \u201e(a)ny identifiable group or individual who can affect the achievement of an \norganization\u201fs objectives\u201f [27, p.91]. Conveying IB knowledge to students from a phronetic \nperspective implies that scenario method should be mobilised on critically reflexive rather \nthan on instrumental terms. Such an application of scenario method is one that triggers \ndecisions and actions directed at satisfying the interests of society, understood in the broadest \npossible sense, both at present and in relation to future generations. \nWhilst Flyvbjerg [2] does not explicitly mention scenario method in his chapter on \nmethodological guidelines for phronetic inquiry, he proffers one possible approach through \nconstruction of shared \u201enarratives (that) provide us a forward glance, helping us to anticipate \nsituations even before we encounter them, allowing us to envisage alternative futures\u201f (p. 137). \nScenario method offers just such possibilities. Engaging in a narrative-based deconstruction \nof the linear case studies in IB textbooks and in reconstruction of multiple scenarios enables \nconsideration of different possible and plausible courses of action and outcomes. Specifically, \ndevelopment of a \u201ecritical scenario method\u201f through incorporation of phronetic inquiry \nsurfaces the range of agendas, rationalities and power relationships of involved and affected \nactors. It supports critical reflection on the impacts of different courses of action upon \ndifferent groups in the context of multiple possible futures. We present the possibilities for \nsuch analysis through considering one illustrative example that takes as its starting point a \nrepresentative case study drawn from a major IB text book [3].  \n \n5. Illustrating possibilities for a critical scenario approach in the classroom context \n \nIn his text on International Business, Charles W.L. Hill offers as the opening \u201ecase\u201f, \u201eFlat \npanel televisions and the Global Economy\u2019 [3, pp.2-3]. In summary, the case outlines the \nnature of this global industry and how one particular MNE, Vizio, has achieved success \nthrough \u201escour(ing) the globe continually for the cheapest manufacturers of flat panel displays \nand electronic components\u201f, \u201etight management of (its) global logistics\u2026 turn over of its \ninventory\u2026 (and) cost saving in a business where prices are falling continually\u201f (p.3). This \ncontinual fall in price of such televisions \u201ebring(s) them within the reach of many more \nconsumers\u201f (p. 2). This example of how one MNE can become a \u201ewinner\u201f and achieve success \nthrough establishing the most efficient and effective global value chains is, to an extent, \nbalanced by reference to resultant \u201elosers\u201f. However, only one example is provided by Hill, \nthe \u201eemployees of manufacturers who make traditional cathode ray TVs in high-cost locations\u201f \n(p. 3). \n This case introduces the chapter on \u201eGlobalization\u2019, which covers such topics as: the \nglobalization of markets and production, \u201edeclining trade and investment barriers\u201f, \u201ethe role of \ntechnological change\u201f, and the changing nature of the MNE. In addition to these positive \naspects \u2013 from the MNE perspective \u2013 Hill introduces some critical issues that may negatively \nimpact the firm, such as: \u201ethe changing world order\u201f, \u201eantiglobalization protests\u201f and \n\u201eglobalization, jobs and income\u201f (p.vii). However, we posit that these topics are addressed at a \nfairly uncritical level. Specifically, we see that they are viewed, not as challenges to the \nfundamental nature of IB \u2013 profit maximization and shareholder value \u2013 but as obstacles to be \naddressed such that, once students \u201ecomplete this book, (they) should have a good grasp of the \n 7 \nissues that managers working within international business have to grapple with on a daily \nbasis, and\u2026 should be familiar with the range of strategies and operating policies available to \ncompete more effectively\u201f (p. 34). In relation to the particular case, any critical response that \nmight be invoked in students\u201f minds is likely defused by the statement that, whilst \u201ethe losers \nin this case are workers in high cost locations who have lost their jobs\u2026 most economists \nargue that the gains outweigh the losses by a wide margin, and that on balance globalization is \na very beneficial process\u201f (p.4). \n \n5.1 Opening up a critical discourse  \nOur starting point in seeking to expand students\u201f thinking might involve asking them to \nconsider issues beyond those of immediate interest to the firm; such as the design, \nmanufacture and distribution of flat panel televisions; and to consider the broader social and \nenvironmental impacts of cycles of production, consumption and disposal of consumer \nelectronics. With appropriate guidance, they might then access literature that raises questions \nabout, i) the nature and future environmental impact of the materials used in manufacture of \nflat panel televisions [28, p.ii] conflict and confusion over the amount of power consumed by \nthem [29, 30], and iii) the health and environmental consequences of the resultant unregulated \ndisposal of outdated cathode ray tube (CRT) screens \u2013 both redundant televisions [31] and \ncomputer monitors replaced by similar flat panel technology [32]. \n This discursive engagement with students and direction to further reading may lead \nthem to construct alternative understandings of the nature and impact of the flat panel \ntelevision industry. Whilst the published case addresses only those involved and affected \nactors who have a direct link to the company \u2013 as subcontractors, suppliers, workers, \nconsumers, competitors, etc. \u2013 a broader reading can introduce consideration of those who are \nindirectly affected \u2013 who suffer \u201ecollateral damage\u201f.  However, in presenting additional \nmaterial largely about the present, we may prompt \u201eso what?\u201f questions in relation to any \npossible future change of trajectory and, in particular, to how the aspiring IB manager may \ninfluence this trajectory. It is in seeking to engage future IB managers in contemplating \nalternative possibilities, and in considering how they might influence a change in direction, \nthat we invoke the use of a critical scenario method. \n \n5.2 Introducing scenario method: identifying \u2018driving forces\u2019 and \u2018higher level factors\u2019 \nScenario method is a group exercise that involves both broad and deep research on the issue \nto hand; here, \u201eThe future nature and impact of the flat panel television industry\u2019; and the \napplication of \u201eintuitive logics\u201f [33] in making sense of all of the material in relation to each \nother. The first stage is the identification of the full range of \u201edriving forces\u201f \u2013 those social, \ntechnological, economic, ecological, political and legal (STEEPL) factors \u2013 that will impact \nthe issue. In relation to the selected topic, these might be surfaced in relation to: \n Social \u2013 buying power, consumption patterns, conservation orientation, ethical disposition, \nFirst World consumer, Third World worker, self- vs. other- orientation, etc. \n Technological \u2013 reliability, redundancy, alternative technologies, recycling and \nreclamation, materials, etc. \n Economic \u2013 global economic (in)stability, costs of production and distribution, buying \nprice, running costs, transport and distribution costs, disposal costs, labour costs, etc. \n Ecological \u2013 toxicity, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. \n Political \u2013 free market\/protectionism, tariff and taxation regimes, employment vs. \nenvironment orientation, MNE vs. nation power dominance, environmental activist \nactivity, etc. \n Legal \u2013 international law, health and safety, union recognition, employment law, disposal \nof toxic materials legislation, etc. \n 8 \nEach driving force should be as detailed as possible in relation to subject area and location \u2013 \ndescribed in respect of its impact within a specific social, economic or geographic context. \nHaving set out as many driving forces as possible, students are then asked to contemplate the \n\u201elimits of possibility and plausibility\u201f for their outcome over the scenario period \u2013 say, 5 \nyears \u2013 by describing the \u201epolar outcomes\u201f for each \u2013 in simplistic terms, the \u201ebest\u201f and \u201eworst\u201f \noutcomes. For example, if a driving force was tabled that read \u201ePerformance factors impacting \nconsumer choice\u201f [30], the polar outcomes might be posited as a) \u201ePicture quality remains key \ncriterion\u201f, and b) \u201eEnergy rating becomes key criterion\u201f. \nOn the basis that the number of driving forces tabled will be substantial \u2013 often \nrunning into hundreds \u2013 the next stage involves \u201eclustering\u201f the driving forces according to \nlinkages of cause\/effect or chronology in order to identify a manageable number of \u201ehigher \nlevel factors\u201f that will be central to the issue at hand over the next 5 years. With regard to the \nissue of flat panel televisions, such factors might include; \u201eProduct performance and \nfunctionality\u201f, \u201eGlobal economic growth\/stagnation\u201f, \u201eLevels of environmental \nawareness\/action\u201f, and \u201eConvergence\/divergence of ICTs\u201f (information and communications \ntechnologies). \n \n5.3 \u2018Framing\u2019, \u2018scoping\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 the scenario storylines \nThrough discussion of the relationships between these factors, the two (termed Factor A and \nFactor B) that combine the greatest perceived impact on the issue with the highest level of \nuncertainty as to what that impact might be are selected in order to \u201eframe and scope\u201f four \nscenarios. The four scenario frames are, again in simplistic terms, constructed around the \ncombination of best\/best (A1\/B1), best\/worst (A1\/B2), worst\/best (A2\/B1), and worst\/worst \n(A2\/B2) possible and plausible outcomes from these two high impact\/uncertainty factors. In \nrelation to the problem considered here, it might be that the scenarios would be framed around \ncombinations of outcomes of: \u201eeconomic growth (A1)\u201f \u2013 \u201eeconomic stagnation (A2)\u201f; \u201egreen \nawareness (B1)\u201f \u2013 \u201elack of sensitivity to green issues (B2)\u201f. Such a choice of scenario \u201eframes\u201f \nmight then lead students to construct one scenario in which there was a combination of best \nstate economic growth in the West (A1) with green awareness (B1) \u2013 a scenario of \"Rise of \nthe Rich Green\". In contrast, within a \"Poor Greens\" (A2\/B1) scenario the less-well-off \nWestern consumer will still be sensitive to green issues but be less able to pay for green \ntechnology. \nHaving defined the broad scope of the four scenarios, the story lines are then \ndeveloped, bringing in the range of polar outcomes to all identified driving forces as \nappropriate. The stories together outline the limits of plausibility and possibility for the future, \nincorporating both \u201eknown\u201f events \u2013 e.g. there will be a US Presidential election in November \n2012 and, barring the unknowable, Barack Obama will be the Democratic candidate \u2013 and \nother speculations, based upon research and analysis, that indicate the logic of cause\/effect \nand\/or chronology in order to arrive at the time horizon outcomes. \nIn our example, within the \u201cRise of the Rich Green\u201d (A1\/B1) scenario, it is plausible \nthat Western consumers will be prompted by growing environmental concerns combined with \neconomic recovery. Here, they become sensitive to the environmental impact of the disposal \nof redundant consumer electronics and, also, are prepared to pay for safe disposal. At the \nsame time, however, the well-off consumer will buy the latest technology and choose, in part, \non the basis of energy-efficiency, environmentally-friendly production and safe future \ndisposal. Within a \"Poor Greens\" (A2\/B1) scenario, however, environmental concerns may be \nset within a world of continuing economic downturn and stagnation. Here, a concerned \nconsumer will buy green new technology when it can be afforded, but will keep and use older \ntechnology in the meantime. In a \"Rich Insensitive\" (A1\/B2) scenario, these Western \nconsumers enjoy a revitalised economy, but with environmental issues by and large \u201eoff the \n 9 \nagenda\u201f. They will pursue the latest technology and turn a blind eye to the detritus created in \nthis pursuit. In a \"Poor Insensitive\" (A2\/B2) scenario, the blind eye will be more tightly \nclosed as cheap-to-buy-and-operate technology is sought from across the world, in a future of \neconomic stagnation and lack of environmental concern. These vignettes of scenarios are, of \ncourse, initial sketches of the outcomes of a real scenario process, but they provide a skeleton \nfor us to engage in consideration of alternative possibilities for the unfolding of the flat panel \nTV case. \n \n5.4 Developing a critical scenario analysis \nScenario method, as conventionally practised, does not incorporate explicit consideration of \nthe full range of involved and affected actors, or stakeholders. The method we use as our \nfoundation [16] presents \u201estakeholder analysis\u201f as an optional addition to the 'mix' of \ningredients; as 'a tool to be used in parallel with the scenario process, as and when members \nof the scenario team find it useful' (p.219). As such, the values, beliefs, expectations and fears \nof \u201eperipheral\u201f actors might be read as being considered and managed instrumentally, as \nnecessary, in order to further the pursuit of shareholder value. In our development of critical \nscenario method, however, we place such considerations at the centre of analysis. In Hill\u201fs \nanalysis of the Vizio case, the actors presented are: (i) American consumers, (ii) South \nKorean panel manufacturers, (iii) Chinese electronic component manufacturers, (iv) Mexican \nassemblers, and (v) blue-collar workers in high-cost locations, of which only the last group is \nclassified as a \u201eloser\u201f. \nWe contend that a broader analysis, using critical scenario method, would surface \nfurther involved and affected actor groupings, such as: (vi) Indian and Chinese citizens who \nlive in village contexts and who process\/reclaim imported redundant CRT TVs by burning the \nplastic covered components on open fires to recover metals \u2013 these village-based reclaimers \nare potentially harmed by the 4-6 lbs of lead per CRT screen that is smashed [34] \u2013 (vii) \nworld citizens who are globally warmed by the increased CO2 output from the increased \npower generation to light up the plasma screens [35] (viii) governmentally recognised CRT \ndisposal outlets in the US and Singapore, (ix) the governments and regulators in the various \ncountries involved in the  manufacture, assembly, and consumption of plasma screens, (x) the \ngovernments of countries involved in the scrapping of outdated CRTs, (xi) non-governmental \nagencies (NGOs) and action groups (e.g. Greenpeace), and (xii) the media who present \ncoverage of related stories [32]. A detailed actor group analysis would, of course, involve a \nmuch wider range, with categories such as NGOs and the media being broken down into \nindividual organisations or media outlets, in specific geographical contexts and with particular \nagendas.  \nDeveloping this broader consideration of actor group involvement, we would then \nhave a resource for engaging in critical discussion with students across a broad societal and \nenvironmental agenda, rather than within a narrow firm-centric, value-oriented one. We \nwould be able to interrogate the scenario stories from the perspective of the full range of \ninvolved and affected actors through application of Flyvbjerg\u201fs question framework for \nphronetic inquiry. We might structure this analysis using a matrix (see Figure 1) that lists our \nfour, fully-developed, scenarios along the top row (Where are we going?) and the range of \nidentified actor groups down the left-hand column. Within each box that marks an intersection \nof a scenario and an actor group, we would consider two issues:  (i) impact of the unfolding \nfuture on the actor group's interests and values (Is this development desirable?) and (ii) likely \naction\/reaction of the group to the particular unfolding future (What, if anything, should we do \nabout it? where \u201ewe\u201f is the particular actor group). In a teaching\/education context, the \nstudents would be required to generate material under each of the two sub-headings for each \nbox. In this way, participants would become sensitised to the plight of each of the groups of \n 10 \nactors and become aware of the degree of power of action that each of them has to preserve or \nenhance their own interests as a particular scenario unfolds.  \n \nInsert Figure 1 here. \n  \nTo give an example of such analysis, we can consider the Asian village-based \nreclaimers. Under the \"Rich Greens\" scenario they lose out and are powerless, as the work of \ndisposal of redundant technology becomes controlled and directed towards new \u201egreen\u201f plants \nin developed economies. Under the \"Poor Greens\" scenario they also lose out, since there are \nless CRT screens sent for scrapping and, again, they tend to go to regulated disposal sites.  By \ncontrast, under the \"Rich Insensitive\" scenario the villagers do well, as there is a copious \nsupply of old technology and little support for less environmentally damaging disposal. \nFinally, under the \"Poor Insensitive\" scenario they get by, as there remains little or no control, \nbut the quantities of material disposed of are reduced.  \nNext, we might consider the US-based disposal sites. Under the \"Rich Green\" \nscenario, the US-government will be sensitive to the need for safe disposal of CRTs and \nwould, likely, keep disposal in the US, or in tightly-regulated Singapore. The US-government \nwould be able to tax new plasma screen purchasers for the disposal of out-dated CRTs. In the \n\"Poor Greens \" scenario,  the US government would, due to its sensitivity to the green values \nof the electorate,  be likely to support US disposal \u2013 which would have the secondary, \npositive,  impact of creating or retaining  jobs in the US.  By contrast, in both the \"Rich \nInsensitive\" and \"Poor Insensitive\" scenarios, nothing much would change from the current \nposition. \nA major point for consideration is that, with only 75 core employees [3] and a \nbusiness model of flexibility and adaptability, it is likely that Vizio will do well under all \nscenarios by, (a) being flexible in assembling any type of TV (green, non-green etc), (b) using \nthe most cost-effective location for manufacture and assembly, and (c) having the ability to \nscale up or down its sourcing of parts for assembly. Whilst it may currently be constrained by \na focus of selling its products only in the US, if it sells in markets beyond the US, then it may \nhave market flexibility as well. \nAssessment of the overall interaction of all groups of actors can be promoted in \nrelation to the scenarios, individually and as a set, through application of Flyvbjerg\u201fs final \nquestion \u2013 Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? Consideration of \nthe range of possible \u201ewinners\u201f and \u201elosers\u201f within the different scenarios, and of the issue of \nmechanisms of power, should give the students a greater understanding of the nature and \nimpact of IB activity and of the role of different actor groups in determining its direction and \nimpact. They should, for example, emerge from this exercise with a clear understanding of the \nnature of the health and environmental risks posed to the communities in which unregulated \nCRT disposal takes place, yet with an equally clear understanding of the lack of power that \nthis group has to affect its own future position within the overall international business of \ntelevision design, production, distribution, consumption and disposal. Finally, students might \nbe asked to project themselves forward to the role of managers in this international business \nand to ponder the question \u201eWhat, if anything, should we do about it?\u201f \n \n6. Concluding remarks \n \nIn this paper, we have posited that managers in IB need to develop a different mindset for the \nfuture, moving from a largely firm-centric view \u2013 grounded in consideration of profit \nmaximization and shareholder value \u2013 to a broader societal and environmental stance. We see \nthe foundations of such a shift as being laid in the education process. Here, we have pointed to \n 11 \nthe potential weakness of IB textbooks, in that they rely mainly upon normative models and \ncase study learning. In seeking to challenge the normative model, however, we have \nacknowledged possible dangers of a purely critical approach, in either being seen as irrelevant \nby or in alienating students. In proposing an interactive model that engages with the \ncomplexities of IB within a broad context, we have turned to scenario method as a vehicle for \ngroup learning. In order to provide a framework for critical reflection on different scenarios \nfor IB; in particular, on their consequences for different individuals and groups across social \nand geographic contexts over time; we have proposed development of a \u201ecritical scenario \nmethod\u201f. This incorporates the ethical dimension inferred in Flyvbjerg\u201fs \u201evalue rational \nquestion\u201f framework for phronetic inquiry, within a critical pedagogy of international \nbusiness education, moving it beyond serving the needs of the instrumental, means-end \noriented management we find advocated in many of the textbooks.  \nIn proposing the application of a critical scenario method; as a form of structured \nanalysis of the range of future possibility and plausibility in respect of how the complex and \nambiguous situation presented in the linear narrative of the textbook case might unfold; \nfollowed by similarly structured investigation of questions of \u201ehow?\u201f, \u201ewhy?\u201f and \u201ewith what \neffect?\u201f through application of Flyvbjerg\u201fs phronetic inquiry, we posit that students of IB will \ngain a greater understanding of the subject. They will be enabled to break free from the \ncontext of the interests of IB firms, customers and shareholders, in order to critically reflect \nupon the impacts and implications of IB activity for the widest range of involved and affected \nparties, both now and in future. \n Revisiting scenario method through application of phronetic inquiry sensitises \nscenario participants to issues of power, and promotes thinking on winner and loser \nperspectives arising from different possible courses of action. Development of a \u201ecritical \nscenario method\u201f prompts consideration of a wider range of options than those that might be \npromoted by a normative framework. Flyvbjerg\u201fs first question \u2013 Where are we going? \u2013 \noffers the potential for students to make explicit their own preconceptions and their \nacculturation to a particular way of thinking. Thereafter, consideration of the range of possible \nimpacts of IB activities upon the widest range of involved and affected parties, both now and \nin future, provides a vehicle for addressing Flyvberg\u201fs second question \u2013 Is this development \ndesirable?. Within the iterative and multiple perspective framework of scenario thinking, the \nthird question \u2013 What if anything should we do about it? \u2013 is addressed through development \nof alternative options for action, beyond those shown or implied in the cases. Finally, \nreflection on the degree to which different groups and individuals hold, or are excluded from, \npower over decision making leads us to consider the final question \u2013  Who gains and who \nloses, and by which mechanisms of power? \u2013  in relation to the trajectory predicated upon the \nnormative approach.  \nAs we propose it here, critical scenario method can be used as a vehicle for \nincorporation of both mainstream and alternative discourses, in support of a critical pedagogy \nthat enables discussion of ethical and moral issues in IB with thoughtful, postgraduate, post-\nexperience students. We also see the value of our approach in offering the potential for \nrealigning the application of scenario method in the realm of IB practice, in order to make \nsalient a broader range of issues than profit maximization and shareholder return. We \nrecognise that sceptics might doubt the possibilities of a move away from the current model \nof IB and might argue that the realities of business life make it unlikely that those dealing \nwith the day-to-day pressures of business-as-usual would be willing and able to engage in \nsuch in-depth critical analysis. However, we believe that the occurrence of such phenomena \nas the current global financial crisis, economic recession and climate change creates an \nimperative for building a different future of IB, whereby IB firms redefine their goals through \nputting the interests of the \u201esocial\u201f before those of the \u201ecorporate\u201f.  \n 12 \nPrimarily, we feel that critical scenario method, applied as outlined here, provides a \nmeans for allowing students to consider and reflect upon issues of resource depletion, \nenvironmental degradation, human exploitation and socio-economic fragmentation, through \ntheir own initiative and by and large in their own terms. It is in this approach that we see the \nseeds of future change in the practices of IB and international management. We hope that, like \nus, the readers of this paper \u2013 and of the whole Special Issue \u2013 are convinced that \u201eanother \nworld [of IB] is possible\u201f and that we, as academics, can shape the future of IB through our \neducational and research practice. \n \nNote \n \n1. Here, we clarify that we define \u201emainstream\u201f IB text books as those that are offered \ninternationally by major publishing houses, that are in their \u201enth\u201f edition, that are claimed to \nbe \u201eleading\u201f or \u201ebest selling\u201f, and that are supported by Internet learning resources. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] H.
