It was argued \nthat there was no fundamental basis for many of the stratigraphical subdivisions of the \nChalk Group shown on recent BGS maps, and that the traditional tripartite (Lower, \nMiddle & Upper Chalk) classification, based on the recognition of two indurated \nchalk horizons (the Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock), was preferable. Field evidence \nin support of the BGS methodology was demonstrated in a presentation by D. T. \nAldiss (BGS).  \n \nThis paper shows that borehole geophysical logs can be used in the subsurface \nrecognition and correlation of formations in the Chalk Group mapped by the BGS, \nand strongly supports the retention of this stratigraphy rather than its abandonment in \nfavour of the traditional scheme. The log signatures provide graphic evidence of the \nprimary lithological variation that some critics have disputed to exist, particularly in \nthe White Chalk Subgroup. \n \nDuring the last 20 years there has been renewed interest in the stratigraphy of the \nChalk Group, especially following the publication of new classifications for the Chalk \nGroup of Sussex (Mortimore, 1986) and Kent (Robinson, 1986). This work has been \ndriven by the need of the user community (predominantly civil engineers) for a \ngeological classification that more accurately reflects large-scale changes in the \nM A Woods \n 3\nphysical characteristics and engineering behaviour of chalk. A plethora of named \nmarker beds, cyclostratigraphical units, members and formations has arisen as a result \nof detailed work in different regions of the UK (Wood & Smith, 1978; Bailey et al., \n1983; Bromley & Gale, 1982; Jarvis & Woodroof, 1984; Jarvis & Tocher, 1987; Gale, \n1995, 1996; Whitham, 1991, 1993; Bristow et al., 1995, 1997, 1999 ; Wood, 1988; \nMortimore et al., 2001). A significant rationalisation of stratigraphical nomenclature \nwas achieved at a meeting of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society, \nconvened in November 1999 at the headquarters of the BGS at Keyworth, \nNottingham. Following discussions by all interested parties, a broadly agreed \nstratigraphical framework was decided upon for successions in northern and southern \nEngland (Rawson et al., 2001; Fig 1), and this is the basis for current BGS work on \nthe Chalk Group. \n \nRealisation that borehole geophysical logs could be used to identify and correlate \nsubsurface Chalk Group successions predates the recent work on the Group's \nstratigraphy. Gray (1958, 1965) identified marker-bands on resistivity logs of the \nBGS Leatherhead (Fetcham Mill) Borehole, Surrey [TQ 1581 5650], and these were \nused by Murray (1986) as a basis for correlating Cenomanian and Turonian \nsuccessions from the London Basin to east Yorkshire. Barker et al. (1984) showed the \nrelationship between  lithostratigraphy and borehole geophysical logs in the Chalk \nGroup of Lincolnshire and Humberside, and Mortimore (1986) and Mortimore & \nPomerol (1987) focused on the utility of borehole geophysics for tracing marker beds \nin the Chalk Group across the Anglo-Paris Basin. Unfortunately, many of these \nadvances were too late for incorporation in the Geological Society's Special Report on \nGeophysical logs in British Stratigraphy (Whittaker et al., 1985), which uses the \nM A Woods \n 4\ntraditional tripartite (Lower, Middle, Upper) subdivision of the Chalk Group, and does \nnot illustrate any resistivity log interpretations for this interval. Nevertheless, \nWhitaker et al. (1985) remains a fundamental introductory reference to the theory and \npractice of geophysical log interpretation in UK stratigraphy. \n \nWith such a wealth of data already published, the BGS realised that its archives of \ngeophysical log data could provide useful regional overviews of the subsurface Chalk \nGroup stratigraphy, and allow the development of three-dimensional digital \nstratigraphical models. Since 1995, the BGS has used geophysical logs to research the \nsubsurface Chalk Group successions across southern England, including London, \nKent, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and parts of East Anglia (Fig. 2).  \nAs well as being a valuable tool in support of mapping, the identification of the BGS \nChalk Group stratigraphy on geophysical logs from water-supply boreholes has \ngreatly benefited hydrogeological projects, providing insights into the relationship \nbetween subsurface water flows and lithostratigraphy (Jones & Robbins, 1999; \nBuckley et al., 2001; Sch\u00fcrch & Buckley, 2002). Significantly, the BGS work has \nfocused on the geophysical log characterisation of formations within the Chalk Group, \nas well as on marker-bed identifications. This approach builds on the work of Bristow \net al. (1997, fig. 9), who illustrated the formational geophysical log correlation of part \nof the Chalk Group across Dorset, Hampshire and Sussex.  In many cases the \ncorrelation of marker-beds can be problematic where geophysical logs are of poor \nresolution. This is particularly true of many older-style borehole logs based on single \npoint resistivity measurements at incremental depths, but even these are interpretable \nin the broader framework of formational stratigraphy. The details of resistivity log \ntypes shown on Figs 3-8 are given in Appendix 1. \nM A Woods \n 5\n \nStratigraphy \n \nThe results of the BGS work show that for Cenomanian to Santonian Chalk Group \nsuccessions, there are gross changes in borehole gamma and resistivity log signatures \nthat can be matched with formational boundaries in borehole core and at outcrop. \nThese features are described below with reference to the standard Cenomanian to \nSantonian Chalk Group stratigraphy for south-east England (Fig. 1). The geophysical \nlog characterisation of post-Santonian Chalk Group formations is still being \ndeveloped . Bristow et al. (1997, fig. 8) illustrated consistent borehole geophysical log \ntrends in Late Santonian and Early Campanian successions in parts of Hampshire and \nSussex, but lack of cored and geophysically logged boreholes through higher parts of \nthe Chalk Group means that interpretations for younger intervals are still too reliant \non tentative extrapolations of outcrop thicknesses. \n \n \nWest Melbury Marly Chalk Formation \n \nThe base of the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation is the base of the Chalk Group, \nmarked by the unconformable contact with the underlying Gault or Upper Greensand \nformations. Where Gault underlies the Chalk, the basal Chalk Group is generally \nmarked by a relative drop in gamma log values, and sometimes by a small resistivity \nlog spike, the latter representing the sandy and silty Glauconitic Marl Member at the \nbase of the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation. Where Upper Greensand underlies \nthe Chalk Group, then the most conspicuous change is usually seen on resistivity logs, \nM A Woods \n 6\nwith a fall in values in the basal Chalk Group (e.g. Leatherhead Borehole, Fig. 3) \nreflecting the presence of marl-rich chalk.  \n \nThe West Melbury Marly Chalk shows a general upward increase in resistivity and \ndecline in the gamma log profile (Fig. 4). This pattern reflects the upward reduction in \nthe amount of mudstone, usually present as rhythmic alternations ('marls') with \nlimestones. Some of the limestones are strongly indurated and stand out as sharp \nspikes on the resistivity log, producing a very serrated signature. \n \nZig Zag Chalk Formation \n \nThe Zig Zag Chalk Formation is characterised by higher resistivity than the \nunderlying West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation. On some resistivity logs the \noverall profile through the Zig Zag Chalk appears relatively flat, in others there is an \nupward increase in resistivity, but a much less pronounced change than that seen \nthrough the West Melbury Marly Chalk. The key to the geophysical interpretation of \nthe base of the Zig Zag Chalk is identification of the Cast Bed, the basal marker-\nhorizon. Woods & Aldiss (2004) showed that this horizon is often present as a small, \nbut distinct and laterally persistent spike on resistivity logs. Using lithological, \nmacrofossil and microfossil data from a cored borehole to identify the Cast Bed on a \nrelated resistivity log is the most accurate method for interpreting the logs of uncored \nboreholes. This is demonstrated by the Netheravon Borehole [SU 1690 4830] in \nWiltshire, the North Farm Borehole [SU 3321 7971] in Berkshire, and the Aycliff \nBorehole in Kent, in which the lithology and macrofossil data from the core clearly \nreveal the identity of the Cast Bed spike on the resistivity signature (Figs 3, 4 & 5). In \nM A Woods \n 7\nthe Berkshire Downs, continuous resistivity logs show a distinctive and consistent \npattern of inflections in the c. 8 m thick interval above the Cast Bed that is helpful to \nthe interpretation of uncored successions (Fig. 4). A somewhat expanded version of \nthe same inflection pattern can be seen in the interval above the Cast Bed on the \nresistivity log of the Fonthill Bishop Borehole in Wiltshire (Fig. 4).  In some regions \nthere are persistent trends in the resistivity pattern of the Zig Zag Chalk that are of \nvalue for detailed correlation (e.g. Berkshire Downs; Fig. 4). There is an upward trend \nof declining gamma log values through the Zig Zag Chalk, continuing the trend seen \nin the underlying West Melbury Marly Chalk. \n \nHolywell Nodular Chalk Formation \n \nWith the exception of the basal unit (Plenus Marls Member), the Holywell Nodular \nChalk is characterised by much higher resistivity log values than adjacent formations, \nand is usually one of the easiest stratigraphical intervals to identify. The mudstone-\nrich Plenus Marls, at the base of the formation, are marked by a dramatic fall in the \nresistivity log values, followed immediately by a sharp increase associated with the \nhighly indurated lithology of the Melbourn Rock (Figs 3, 5 to 8). Since the combined \nthickness of the Plenus Marls and Melbourn Rock is typically just a few metres, these \nresistivity changes are usually manifest as very sharp inflections on log signatures. \nGamma logs typically show a sharp high value spike in the clay-rich Plenus Marls, \nfollowed by a significant fall in values above. On high resolution resistivity logs, the \nlow resistivity inflection formed by the Plenus Marls sometimes has a small spike \nwithin it, probably representing the less clay-rich and more indurated central part of \nM A Woods \n 8\nthe Plenus Marls, equating with Bed 3 of Jefferies (1963) detailed Plenus Marls \nstratigraphy. \n \nThe high resistivity interval formed by the Holywell Nodular Chalk is punctuated by \nthin, sharply defined, low resistivity horizons, representing the thin marls that are \ncommonly developed through the formation. In some regions, the form of the \nresistivity signature through the Holywell Nodular Chalk can be broken down into \nthree broad high resistivity spikes that appear to be widely developed and of value for \ncorrelation (e.g. Netheravon Borehole, Fig. 4; Berkshire Downs, Fig. 7). The lowest \nof these spikes is usually the Melbourn Rock; influxes of shell-rich chalk appear to \nform the two higher spikes in the Berkshire Downs. \n \nNew Pit Chalk Formation \n \nOn borehole resistivity logs, the New Pit Chalk is represented by a broad interval of \nlowered resistivity log values between the higher values characterising the Holywell \nNodular Chalk (below) and the Lewes Nodular Chalk (above) (Figs. 3, 6 to 8). In the \nNetheravon Borehole (Fig. 3) and parts of the Berkshire Downs (Fig. 7), the New Pit \nChalk appears thin because of erosion and\/or non-deposition associated with a \nregionally developed hardground (Ogbourne Hardground) at the base of the \nimmediately overlying Lewes Nodular Chalk (Gale, 1996; Woods & Aldiss, 2004). \nThe base of the New Pit Chalk is within the interval of sharply declining resistivity \nlog values that marks the upward transition from relatively hard Holywell Nodular \nChalk to softer New Pit Chalk Formation. By reference to a cored and geophysically \nlogged borehole, the base of the New Pit Chalk can successfully be traced out on the \nM A Woods \n 9\ngeophysical logs of uncored boreholes. Often the boundary is coincident with a small \nbut prominent spike in the gamma log (e.g. Reculver Borehole, Fig. 6), representing \nthe Gun Gardens Main Marl of Mortimore (1986) (= Lulworth Marl of Gale, 1996), \nthe lithological marker-bed for the junction of the Holywell Nodular Chalk and New \nPit Chalk. \n \nResistivity logs through the New Pit Chalk generally show several consistently \ndeveloped markers that are of value for correlation. These markers are low resistivity \ninflections, representing major marl seams in the succession that correspond with \nsignificant spikes on the gamma log. Some of these markers were identified in the \nLeatherhead Borehole by R. N. Mortimore, C. J. Wood and K. Murray  as the New Pit \nMarl 1, New Pit Marl 2 and the Glynde Marl Complex (Wood,1986; Fig. 3). The New \nPit Marls form a conspicuous pair of low resistivity spikes near the top of the \nformation, and a broad low resistivity 'embayment' (often with small parasitic spikes) \nis the characteristic signature of the Glynde Marl Complex at the top of the New Pit \nChalk Formation. In the London, Berkshire Downs and Hertfordshire chalk \nsuccessions, there are consistently developed sets of inflections that allow detailed \ncorrelation of geophysical logs in the New Pit Chalk (Figs 3, 7 & 8). In the Berkshire \nDowns, a conspicuous pair of inflections in the New Pit Chalk  ('Marker Marls' of Fig. \n7) appear to equate with marl seams below the New Pit Marls (Woods & Aldiss, \n2004), possibly including the Round Down Marl of Gale (1996) (= Malling Street \nMarl of Mortimore, 1986).  \n \n \n \nM A Woods \n 10\nLewes Nodular Chalk Formation \n \nThe Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation is characterised by higher resistivity values than \nthe underlying New Pit Chalk. However, regional stratigraphical variation at the base \nof the Lewes Nodular Chalk produces regional change in the response of resistivity \nlogs through this interval. In some areas (e.g. Berkshire Downs, Chilterns), the base of \nthe Lewes Nodular Chalk is a hardground complex (traditionally named the 'Chalk \nRock') associated with the erosion and \/or condensation of stratigraphical intervals \n(Fig. 1). More complete successions occur elsewhere (e.g. North Downs; Fig. 3), \nwhere the Chalk Rock is absent or only weakly developed. \n \nIrrespective of whether or not the Chalk Rock is present, the incoming of hard, \nnodular chalk at the base of the Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation is signalled by a \nchange in the resistivity log profile. Where no Chalk Rock is present, the generalised \nprofile is from upwardly declining resistivity in the New Pit Chalk to gradually \nupwardly increasing resistivity. In some boreholes, the basal part of the Lewes \nNodular Chalk appears to have a rather flat resistivity profile (e.g. Leatherhead \nBorehole, Fig. 3), but containing spikes of greater resistivity than occur in the top of \nthe New Pit Chalk. A series of sharply defined low resistivity spikes, representing \nmajor marl seams in the base of the Lewes Nodular Chalk, punctuate the general trend \nin resistivity and are of great value for correlation (Fig. 3). These are the Southerham, \nCaburn and Bridgewick Marls of Mortimore (1986); the inflection in the resistivity \nlog profile that marks the base of the Lewes Nodular Chalk usually occurs at a small \nresistivity high, immediately below the prominent low resistivity inflection that \nrepresents Southerham Marl 1 of Mortimore (1986) (Figs 3, 6 to 8). \nM A Woods \n 11\n \nWhere the Chalk Rock is well developed, a sharp high resistivity spike marks the base \nof the Lewes Nodular Chalk, corresponding with the massive, indurated beds of chalk \nthat constitute the Chalk Rock. Concentrations of glauconite and phosphate at the \nconstituent hardground surfaces usually means that the Chalk Rock appears as a broad \nspike on gamma logs. On detailed resistivity logs, the component hardgrounds of the \nChalk Rock may be resolvable, and in some areas at least one strong low resistivity \nspike (in many cases corresponding to Southerham Marl 1) occurs within the broader \nhigh resistivity spike formed by the Chalk Rock (Fig. 5). \n \nAbove the basal part of the Lewes Nodular Chalk, the form of the resistivity signature \nthrough the remainder of the formation can be quite variable, although at least two \npersistent types of pattern are recognisable. The first is where the resistivity signature \nhas one or two major high resistivity spikes, separated by lower resistivity intervals \n(Fig. 8). Alternatively, the rise in resistivity seen at the base of the Lewes Nodular \nChalk may be followed by a gradual upward decline, sometimes with a spike just \nbelow the top of the formation (Fig. 7). The high resistivity spikes represent \nhardgrounds or major flint-bearing intervals in the Lewes Nodular Chalk. Broad \nintervals of lower resistivity represent less strongly indurated beds of nodular chalk. \nAlthough marls occur in the middle and higher parts of the Lewes Nodular Chalk, \nfew, with the local exception of the Lewes Marl and Shoreham Marl 2 (Table 1, Fig. \n3, Fig. 5), are consistently resolvable on resistivity and gamma logs. \n \n \n \nM A Woods \n 12\nSeaford Chalk Formation \n \nA variety of resistivity log patterns mark the boundary of the Lewes and Seaford \nChalk formations, but at least two patterns are discernible. In some cases there is a \nsharp change from the hard, nodular lithology of the Lewes Nodular Chalk to the \nsofter Seaford Chalk Formation, marked by a conspicuous decline in resistivity log \nvalues. This is shown by some boreholes in the London region (Fig. 3). In the \nBerkshire Downs the lithological change is more gradational, and the boundary is \nmarked by an inflection of the resistivity log profile, below which resistivity values \nprogressively increase in the upper part of the Lewes Nodular Chalk, and above which \nresistivity values remain relatively stable in the basal part of the Seaford Chalk (Fig. \n7). The lower part of the Seaford Chalk Formation typically contains common semi-\ntabular flints, up to 0.3 m thick, which may be represented as a series of sharp, high \nresistivity spikes (e.g. Chapel Wood Borehole, Fig. 7) and make interpretation of the \nformational base more problematic. In some cases, a small pair of low resistivity \ninflections, with corresponding spikes on the gamma log, occurs at the top of the \nLewes Nodular Chalk (e.g. Leatherhead Borehole, Fig. 3); they represent the \nShoreham Marls of Mortimore (1986), the upper of which (Shoreham Marl 2) is the \nmarker bed for the base of the Seaford Chalk Formation. \n \nThe lower third of the Seaford Chalk contains the Belle Tout Marls, usually \ndiscernible on good quality borehole geophysical logs (Mortimore & Pomerol, 1987, \nfig. 3), but sometimes masked by the strong responses produced by flint bands. \nConsistent resistivity log patterns are hard to determine in the remainder of the \nM A Woods \n 13\nSeaford Chalk, and the consistent characterisation of marker-beds has not been \nconvincingly demonstrated.  \n \nNewhaven Chalk Formation \n \nIn some parts of southern England the base of the Newhaven Chalk can be recognised \nby a conspicuous decline in resistivity log values. This is best exemplified by the \nsingle point resistivity logs of the Leatherhead Borehole (Fig. 3) and the Shalbourne \nBorehole (Fig. 7), and reflects the upward appearance of very soft, poorly flinty chalk \nin the lower part of the Newhaven Chalk Formation.  \n \nCase studies \n \nIn order to demonstrate the consistency of borehole geophysical log response to Chalk \nGroup lithostratigraphy, selections of borehole resistivity and gamma logs are \nillustrated and described from four regions of southern England: London, Kent, \nBerkshire Downs and Hertfordshire (Figs 2, 3, 6 to 8). \n \nLondon area (Fig. 3) \n \nThe two cored and geophysically logged boreholes at Leatherhead and Warlingham \nprovide the best means of interpreting the numerous borehole resistivity logs that \ntraverse the Chalk in the London area. Both Leatherhead and Warlingham contain an \nabnormally condensed West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation (Wood, 1996), between \n10 and 15 m thick, overlain by a much thicker interval (c. 50 m) of Zig Zag Chalk \nM A Woods \n 14\nFormation. The base of the Zig Zag Chalk is a very conspicuous high resistivity spike, \nreferred to as the Totternhoe Stone by Murray (1986) but perhaps more correctly \nregarded as the Cast Bed. The Totternhoe Stone is an erosive horizon that in some \nareas replaces the Cast Bed as the basal marker of the Zig Zag Chalk, but it is weakly \ndeveloped in the North Downs (Wood, 1996). \n \nThe Holywell Nodular Chalk is a consistently developed interval across the region, 15 \nto 20 m thick. The base and top of the overlying New Pit Chalk are also well defined \nin the London area, but the correlation of the internal stratigraphy is more \nproblematic. A pair of low resistivity inflections, identified as New Pit Marl 1 and \nNew Pit Marl 2 by Wood (1986) in the Leatherhead Borehole, and herein designated \n'A' and 'B' in the Winchester House Borehole (Fig. 3), appear to be correlative and \ntraceable across the region. However, upon detailed comparison of the Leatherhead \nand Winchester House resistivity logs, the interpretation is less straightforward; New \nPit Marl 1 is probably the upper ('A') of the two inflections in the Winchester House \nBorehole (Fig. 3), and inflection 'B' is more likely to equate with a level below the \nNew Pit Marls. It is also clear from the correlation that there is expansion of the New \nPit Chalk in the Cheam Borehole, close to a region of inferred Mesozoic \nsynsedimentary growth faulting (Ellison et al., 2004, fig. 42).  \n \nThe Lewes Nodular Chalk, and in particular a group of marls identified in the \nLeatherhead Borehole as the Southerham Marl, Caburn Marl , Bridgewick Marls and \nLewes Marl, is clearly traceable across the region. A high resistivity interval, just \nbelow the Lewes Marl, equates with hard, nodular chalks that elsewhere form part of \nthe 'Chalk Rock'. Comparison of the single point and continuous resistivity logs of the \nM A Woods \n 15\nLeatherhead Borehole shows that two or more closely spaced marls can be \nrepresented by a single low resistivity spike, and this needs to be borne in mind when \nattempting detailed marker-bed correlations. \n \nThe junction of the Lewes Nodular Chalk and Seaford Chalk formations shown on \nFigure 3 is modified from that shown in recently published resistivity log correlations \nof the London area (Ellison et al., 2004, fig. 6). The additional resistivity logs shown \non Figure 3, particularly that at Dagenham, demonstrate that the upper part of the \nLewes Nodular Chalk is not so greatly condensed in the Grays and Winchester House \nboreholes as suggested by Ellison et al. (2004), although condensation of the lower \npart of the formation is still evident in the Grays, Dagenham and Heath Farm \nsuccessions. The revised boundary is nevertheless coincident with a significant fall in \nresistivity, and with a significant low resistivity spike in the Heath Farm Borehole that \nperhaps represents Shoreham Marl 2. Outcrop data shows that there is considerable \nlateral variation in the thickness of the Seaford Chalk in the London area that cannot \nsimply be explained by differential erosion at the Palaeogene contact. For example, in \nthe Leatherhead Borehole, the total thickness of the formation is c. 40 m, which is low \ncompared to incomplete thicknesses derived from composite outcrop sections  \nelsewhere in the London region (e.g. Ellison et al., 2004, fig. 8), and much less than \nfor successions in the Berkshire Downs (Fig. 7; Woods & Aldiss, 2004).  \n \nIn the Leatherhead Borehole, the top of the Seaford Chalk and basal Newhaven Chalk \nare unequivocally proved by the presence of the Clandon Hardground (Wood, 1996) \noverlain by records of the index crinoid Uintacrinus socialis. The Newhaven Chalk \nFormation is the youngest part of the Chalk Group known in the London area. \nM A Woods \n 16\n \nKent (Fig. 6) \n \nMany of the borehole resistivity logs from Kent reproduce features already described \nin the London area. Interpretation of the Grey Chalk Subgroup is based on \ncorrelations shown on Figure 4 and discussed above. The remainder of the \ninterpretation is based on core from the Lower Venson Farm Borehole. The resistivity \nlog of the Lewes Nodular Chalk in the Reculver 1 Borehole is abnormal; the lower \nthan expected resistivity values probably result from the influence of saline ground \nwater at this coastal site. Nevertheless, the gamma log of the Reculver Borehole \nclearly shows a series of high gamma spikes that correspond to the marl seam \nsuccession seen in the lower part of the Lewes Nodular Chalk in the London area. The \nlowest and most conspicuous of these gamma spikes almost certainly represents \nSoutherham Marl 1.  \n \nIn the Lower Venson Farm Borehole, the top of the Lewes Nodular Chalk is placed at \na small low resistivity inflection. Although this is a short distance above the lowest \nmicrofossil evidence for the M. coranguinum Zone (Wilkinson, 2003; Fig. 6; the base \nof which is usually coincident with Shoreham Marl 2 and the base of the Seaford \nChalk Formation) in the borehole, it accords better with lithological and macrofossil \nevidence from the core. A similar inflection is presumed to mark the base of the \nSeaford Chalk in the Reculver Borehole, and a more general fall in resistivity log \nvalues, as elsewhere, marks the base of the formation in the Motney Hill and Oare \nCreek boreholes. A sharp increase in the gamma log, near the top of the Reculver \nBorehole, represents argillaceous strata that overlie the Chalk Group. \nM A Woods \n 17\n \nSeveral of the boreholes shown on Figure 6 were also interpreted by Mortimore and \nPomerol (1987, fig. 7), and their correlations broadly agree with the interpretation \nshown on Figure 6. These authors show that the series of sharp low resistivity \ninflections above the Southerham Marl 1 in the Oare Creek Borehole represent the \nCaburn Marl, Bridgewick Marls and Lewes Marl, and the Glynde Marls form the \nbroad low resistivity inflection seen in the top of the New Pit Chalk in the Oare \nCreek, Boughton and St. Margarets boreholes (Fig. 6). However, a key difference \nexists in the interpretation of the lower part of the Boughton Borehole, which \nMortimore & Pomerol (1987) show as condensed and in part use as evidence for a \nregion of sedimentary thinning named the 'Margate Axis'. The National Grid \nReference of Mortimore & Pomerol's Boughton log was not published, but the log has \nbeen digitised and compared with the log for Boughton shown on Figure 6. The \ncomparison shows that they are probably logs of the same borehole; individual \ninflections can be matched at similar depths between the logs, but the bottom of the \nMortimore & Pomerol log falls short of the distinct high resistivity interval formed by \nthe Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation on the Boughton log of Figure 6. This \ninterpretation is further confirmed by a nearby borehole at Boughton Street [TR 0529 \n5942], showing that there is no unusual condensation of the Holywell and New Pit \nChalk formations.  \n \nBerkshire Downs (Fig. 7) \n \nData from the Berkshire Downs has already been discussed in detail by Woods and \nAldiss (2004). A selection of the logs are reproduced herein to demonstrate the \nM A Woods \n 18\ngeneral continuity with the resistivity signatures already described in London and \nKent, and to show their value in determining lateral changes in formational \nthicknesses (highlighted by grey shading on Fig. 7). A pair of low resistivity markers \nin the New Pit Chalk ('Marker Marls') are analagous to the two prominent low \nresistivity markers in the New Pit Chalk of the London area ('A' and 'B' on Figure 3), \nbut are probably older (Woods & Aldiss, 2004, fig. 5). The Berkshire Downs region \nalso shows the development of the Chalk Rock. Consequently the junction of the New \nPit Chalk and Lewes Nodular Chalk is more conspicuously marked on resistivity logs \nthan in the London and Kent regions, and some marls from this interval in the London \nand Kent regions are absent in the Berkshire Downs. Data from the cored BGS \nBanterwick Barn Borehole suggests that the base of the Seaford Chalk, as marked by \nlithological change in the core and corresponding change in the pattern of the \nresistivity log, is at least locally below Shoreham Marl 2, the usual marker-bed for the \nbase of the formation (Woods & Aldiss, 2004). \n \nHertfordshire (Fig. 8) \n \nA superb series of resistivity logs from the Chalk of Hertfordshire clearly delimits the \nHolywell, New Pit, Lewes and Seaford Chalk formations in the subsurface. In \nparticular there is a very consistent development of a pair of  low resistivity spikes in \nthe New Pit Chalk, which undoubtedly represent marls, possibly correlative with  the \n'Marker Marls' of the Berkshire Downs area (see above). Southerham Marl 1 is \nconspicuously developed just above the base of the Lewes Nodular Chalk, and there \nare two very strong resistivity spikes in the overlying succession, representing the \n'Chalk Rock' and 'Top Rock' (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, there is no nearby cored and \nM A Woods \n 19\ngeophysically logged succession against which to confirm the geological \ninterpretation, but it is strongly supported by the published interpretation of the \nThundridge Borehole (Wood, 1986) and the interpretation of geophysical logs in the \nChalk of the Hitchin district (Hopson et al., 1996, fig. 8). Further afield, the resistivity \nlog of the cored Stowlangtoft Borehole, in the Bury St Edmunds district (Bristow, \n1990; Fig. 2), strongly suggests the northward extent of the Holywell, New Pit and \nLewes Nodular Chalk into southern East Anglia.   \n \nConclusions \n \nFor Cenomanian - Santonian Chalk Group successions, borehole geophysical logs \nprovide graphic supporting evidence for the validity of formational subdivisions \nmapped by the BGS. Cored and geophysically logged boreholes can be used to predict \nreliably the subsurface development of these formations in resistivity and gamma logs \nfrom uncored successions. These data may also reveal lateral changes in \nstratigraphical units that might not otherwise be seen or predicted. However, \ngeophysical logs alone are not always reliable for marker-bed correlations, as \nexemplified by the New Pit Marls of the London area (Fig. 3).  \n \n \nAcknowledgements: I thank Vin Robinson and Alan Waters of the Environment \nAgency (Thames Region) for generously allowing access to their borehole records.
