This growth in student\nnumbers has not been matched by an increase in academic staff devoted to teaching. In\naddition, higher education has in the 1990s suffered an approximate 20 per cent reduction\nin government funding if the effects of inflation and student numbers are taken into\naccount. At the same time there has been a demand for the investigation of teaching\nquality, leading to the Teaching Quality Assurance process (Ellis, 1993). Thus a number of\nconverging factors have stimulated the need to look for alternative and innovative methods\nof teaching in veterinary undergraduate education.\n75\nV.H.M. Dole et a\\ Computer-assisted learning as an alternative to didactic lectures\nIt is essential for veterinary students to understand the physical processes involved in\ndiagnostic imaging; for example the importance of radiation safety, and the recognition\nand elimination of artefacts which might mar clinical interpretation of radiographs.\nUnfortunately the physics of diagnostic imaging was a relatively unpopular part of the\nfourth-year course because the comprehension and retention of facts delivered during\npresenter-paced, didactic lectures were hampered by the disparate pre-existing knowledge\nof physics among veterinary students.\nThe Computer-assisted Learning in Veterinary Education (CLIVE) Phase 2 Teaching and\nLearning Technology Programme (TLTP) project has enabled the authors to change the\nway in which diagnostic imaging is taught at the University of Glasgow (see\nhttp:\/\/www.clive.ed.ac.uk\/ for more information). The diagnostic imaging course originally\ncomprised five lectures on the physics of diagnostic imaging complimented by lectures on\nradiological interpretation and film-reading practicals. The lectures on the physics of\ndiagnostic imaging have been replaced by the use of the.Physics of Diagnostic Imaging\nCAL package (Sullivan, Dale and May, 1998).\nThe pedagogical reason for replacing a component of the course with CAL was to\nintroduce a student-centred, self-paced, independent learning resource as a potentially\nmore enjoyable alternative to didactic lectures. The availability of the finished package\nprovided an opportunity to assess whether students would learn as effectively from CAL\nmaterial as they apparently do from lectures, and enabled the authors to record changing\nstudent attitudes towards computers in teaching over a three-year period. Although much\nof the course is theory-laden, ultimately it is in the clinical situation that veterinary\nstudents will apply their knowledge of the physics of diagnostic imaging, so many real-life\nexamples are used in the program.\nThe package was supported by image-based question and answer problems delivered using\nthe CLIVE QA template developed at the University of Edinburgh (Figure 1). Since its\nrelease in 1993, self-assessment materials created using this template have been used\nfrequently by students at all the UK veterinary schools and its role as an effective revision\nj Vrtat 3 (estates m the 5\u00bbtona.'y\u00bboseeid\nA\nt; A^cfcd ertodtf -> increased ii-g^t arve w\ne sman eSec&ve tecs* spot\nit) C&PP& anode condt-cfe he\u00abtwe!t\n\u00abij Oil svrfQfxlc& the tube\nfigure \/: The QA module\ndlowing students to test\nthdr knowledge of\nradiological physics\n76\nALT-] VWume 7 Number 3\ntool throughout the five-year veterinary degree has been documented (Holmes and\nNicholls, 1996).\nThe relevance of this study is highlighted by the anticipated need for veterinary students to\ndevelop the self-paced, independent learning skills they will need to avail themselves of the\nanticipated explosion in the provision of veterinary continuing professional development\n(Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, 1996,1997).\nMaterials and methods\nThe Physics of Diagnostic Imaging package consists of fifteen modules designed and\nwritten using Authorware (Macromedia), deliverable over a NetWare 3\/Netware 4 network\n(Novell) and able to run under MS Windows 3.1I95I98INT. The package is a multimedia\nCAL program which incorporates problem-solving activities and questions (Figures 2 and\n3) to test student understanding of the concepts introduced throughout the package.\nIndividual units in modules were designed to take students 15-30 minutes so that the entire\npackage could take 10 hours with the student being given 10 weeks to complete the package\nbefore the degree examination in week 14 of the semester. The components of the package\nare shown in Table 1. The package was intended for use by fourth-year undergraduates.\nThe revised CAL-based physics of diagnostic imaging course includes the following\nelements (five lectures having been replaced by courseware):\n\u2022 timetabled use of courseware (10 hours allocated), plus free access;\n\u2022 student notes;\n\u2022 standard textbooks in library;\n\u2022 tutorials;\n\u2022 film-reading tutorial;\n\u2022 clinical experience.\n\u00a3\u00bb l . l r Production of X-ravs\nFigure 2: A saeenshot\nillustrating interaction fa the\nPhysics of Diagnostic imaging\nGeneration of high speed electrons\nfa carers is passed\nthrough *e csSiode *e\nresistance in the f.temers\ncauses tte f.lamer* to heat:\nup and give off electrons that\nSSher round the wire as a\nspacecharge .\nTiy changing the current passing\nthrough the cathode by clicking on the\n:\n acrow buttons next to the ftmmete^\nPointslo note]\nThere are more electrons\nbecause of Use greater \u2022\ncurrent.\nExit\u2014\nClkt: on !1* words m bold lost* a* ciKuZ,\nthen the ammeter ccarois to observe titc Oilier\nmodules\n77\nV.

The first cohort to use the\npackage was the 1995-6 fourth-year intake, followed by fourth-year students in the 1996-7\nand 1997-8 sessions. In comparable studies control groups have been set up where one\ngroup of students continues to attend traditional classes, and their performance is\ncompared with that of the group using the new technology (e.g. Rogers, Regehr, Yeh and\nHowdieshell, 1998). However the validity of such control groups has been questioned\nbecause of the number and complexity of factors involved in learning (Gunn, 1996), and\ncontrol groups were not used in this study.\nEvaluation\nBefore development the storyboard for the Physics of Diagnostic Imaging was approved in\nall six UK veterinary schools by subject specialists and members of the CLIVE\nconsortium, to ensure compatibility with courses in all the schools.\nDesigner evaluation\nEvaluation of the navigation system and the interface design was undertaken by the Design\nManager for the CLIVE consortium, and other designers, who tested the program during\nits development. The designers expressed a common view that the navigation system was\nsimple and easy to follow, and that the interface was clear and aesthetically pleasing.\nPeer evaluation\nFive Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons holding the Diploma in Veterinary Radiology\nwith experience of teaching diagnostic imaging physics agreed to review the CAL package,\nas delivered to the students. There were no major criticisms of the package. Minor points\nmade related to spelling mistakes or minor points of factual inaccuracies. The consensus\nwas positive and that the material was well presented and easy to follow.\nExternal evaluation\nAn external evaluation group, commissioned by the CLIVE consortium, used the\ncourseware and provided a report of their findings. The group consisted of two\n78\nALT-] Vo\/ume 7 Number 3\nRadiological Physics\n1.1 The Nature and Production of X-rays\n1.2 Interaction of X-rays with Matter\n1.3 The Recording Medium\n1.4 Image Quality\n1.5 Positioning & Restraint\n1.6 Processing & Film Faults\n1.7 Radiobiology & Radiation Protection\nPhysics of Ultrasonography\n2.1 Production of Ultrasound Waves\n22 Interaction of Ultrasound with Tissues\n2.3 Ultrasound Image\n2A Processing the Signal\n25 Tissue Echogenicity\nOther imaging techniques\n3.1 Nuclear Medicine\n3.2 Computed Tomography\n3.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging\na.

The evaluation\nteam noted that the large corpus of information was presented in an engaging and clear\nway, using a variety of interactions to engage the student, rather than allowing the user to\nbe an entirely passive individual. Like the designers, they stated that the graphic design was\nextremely clear and easy to view. They did have queries about the appropriateness of some\ninteractions, and suggested putting some pop-up information in separate screens. Other\ncomments related to simplifying instructions and making some changes to animations. In\nresponse, a second version of the program was released which incorporated the changes\nand several other minor improvements. This was released to students in the 1996-7 session.\nStudent evaluation\nA post-task questionnaire was developed by the courseware designer, and approved by the\ncontent author. This was distributed to the first cohort of students (1995-6) and again to\nstudents in the 1996-7 and 1997-8 sessions. The questionnaire was not exhaustive, to avoid\ndiscouraging the students from providing feedback, but was considered sufficient to\nprovide an insight into students' expectations and experiences of the courseware.\n79\nV.H.M. Dak et al Computer-assisted learning as an alternative to didactic lectures\nObservation and informal discussions with students provided further information. For a\nmore accurate and objective measure of learning gains, fourth-year examination results\nbetween 1993 and 1998 were statistically compared.\nQuestionnaire-based evaluation\nFifty-five of the 78 students in the first cohort returned evaluation forms (71 per cent). In\nthe following year 48\/69 forms were returned (70 per cent). The response of the third\ncohort was much greater with 81\/85 forms returned (95 per cent).\nReasons quoted for using the program included:\n\u2022 'As a backup to the notes';\n\u2022 'To help me understand diagnostic imaging';\n\u2022 'Images can be looked at repeatedly';\n\u2022 'It was examinable';\n\u2022 'More interesting and informative than the lecture notes';\n\u2022 'Because we were told to'.\nThe latter response appeared more frequently in the returns of the first cohort of students.\nAnother noticeable difference between the first and second cohort of students was the\nstrong reluctance of the first cohort to accept the courseware as a replacement for lectures,\na typical comment being: 'The program should be used as a companion to lectures, not as a\nreplacement.' In the forms collected from the second cohort, this sentiment was not\nexpressed. Neither was it stated by any students in the third cohort, although two students\nexpressed a preference for textbooks over computers, stating that they could be used in the\ncomfort of their own homes 'with a coffee'.\nFor the first cohort of students, only 20.1 per cent of the students responding claimed to\nhave enjoyed using the program, however 80 per cent of these students found some or all of\nthe modules helpful. Some students even commented generally: 'I did not enjoy using the\nprogram but I found it helpful.' In the second cohort, 70.8 per cent of students claimed to\nhave enjoyed using the program, and 87.5 per cent of the responding students found some\nor all of the modules useful. In the third cohort 50 per cent of students enjoyed using the\nprogram and 84.8 per cent of students found some or all of the modules useful (Figure 4).\nThis reduced level of enjoyment may be explained by a network server crash disrupting the\navailability of Version 2 of the package, resulting in students accessing two slightly\ndifferent versions.\nOverall, 47 per cent of the modules accessed by the first cohort were thought to have\nhelped the students to understand the topics (315 'helpful' modules accessed \/ 667 modules\naccessed). For the following cohort of students this proportion was 62.3 per cent (364\/584),\nand in the third cohort the proportion was even higher at 67.3 per cent (641\/952)\n(Figure 4).\nSome students from the first cohort preferred short modules - the duration of longer\nmodules contributing to their lack of enthusiasm\/enjoyment - while others preferred a\nmore comprehensive and thorough account:\n80\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nBOO-\n70.0'\nI 60.0\n| 50.0-\n5\n2\ns 40:0\nS 30.0\nc\u00bb\n1 20.0\n* 10.0\n0 0\nnJ\n1\ni.i\nJl\nJ1\n111\n1.2\n1\n1\n1.3\n1I\n1.4\nn\nJ1I1\n1.5\nI\nI\n1I\n1.6\n-\njII\nLI\n1.7\nM<\nl1\nU\n2.1\ndul* mi\nJI\nl11Li\n2.2\nmb\u00abr\nJ\nI1\nI1JL\n2.3\n1\n1\nI\nlLI\n24\n1111\n2.5\nI\n11\n3.1\nij\nI\n1\n3.2\n1\n3.3\n\u2022 1999-96\n\u2022 199S-97\n\u2022 1997-98\nFigure 4: Analysis of the evaluation form responses\n\u2022 'The ultrasound section was better than the section on X-rays (shorter, faster to work\nthrough)';\n\u2022 'The ultrasound section was not as useful as the section on X-rays - it was not as\nexplanatory';\n\u2022 'Sometimes interactive screens are unnecessary - they slow the program down'.\nStudents in the second and third cohorts did not make comparable statements, although\none student in the third cohort requested more information on CT and MRI (the smallest\nmodules).\nAnalysis of the questionnaire responses also revealed that:\n\u2022 most students spent between IS and 20 minutes on each module;\n\u2022 students were divided about the usefulness of a bibliography;\n\u2022 some students thought that prior knowledge was assumed, but this response declined\nover the three years.\nNo significant and recurring problems were reported by the students relating to either\nscreen design or navigation in the courseware program (Figure 5).\nStatistical analysis of examination results\nStatistical analyses were performed to establish whether or not the change in course\nstructure would affect student performance in the 1996 degree examinations of the first\n81\nV.

The data from the 1993, 1994 and 1998\nprofessional degree examinations were also analysed. These examinations were chosen for\nanalysis because they included diagnostic imaging questions.\nA general one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to analyse each data set to\ndetermine whether there was a significant difference between student performance in each\ncategory\/subject (i.e. p < 0.05). Subjects included anaesthesia, diagnostic imaging, equine\nstudies, ophthalmology, orthopaedics and reproduction. To establish which subjects the\nstudents performed better in, it was necessary to carry out multiple-range tests (pairwise\ncomparisons).\nPrior to the incorporation of CAL into the course, analysis of the 1993 examination results\nshows a significant difference (p < 0.001) between performance in different subjects, with\ndiagnostic imaging appearing in the lowest of two groups of subjects. In 1994 the\nsignificantly different results (p < 0.001) fall into four performance groups. Diagnostic\nimaging falls into the lowest group of these subject groups. After the introduction of CAL\nthe performance in 1996 between subjects is significantly different (p < 0.001), with\ndiagnostic imaging appearing in the highest of two groups of subjects. In 1998\nperformance is again significantly different (p < 0.001) and performance in diagnostic\nimaging is significantly higher than in any other subject.

This enables us to draw the conclusion\nthat the examination results have improved as a result of lecture replacement with CAL.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the study are discussed in terms of module design, screen design, the role of\nCAL in the curriculum, attitudes to CAL and examination performance.\nModule design\nIn the diagnostic imaging course, core concepts must be understood to appreciate the clinical\nsignificance of radiographs and other images. The arrangement of the courseware modules\nwas such that students were encouraged to work through the modules sequentially on a first\nouting, although students could elect to omit the foundation modules. Each module had em-\nbedded problems that referred to previous modules, which the student was expected to solve.\nHooper, O'Conner and Cheesmar (1998) stress the importance of problem-solving exercises in\nmedical education, emphasizing that this is the process by which clinical diagnoses are made.\nThe reiteration of important concepts in different ways has been shown to help students\nintegrate information, constructing knowledge by linking new information to information\npreviously given (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1994). The use of the Edinburgh QA template to\nconstruct a self-assessment set of questions allowed the same knowledge to be tested, by\nproviding visual clues, helping to reinforce the key points illustrated in the CAL package.\nScreen design\nThe questionnaire analysis indicated that few students had problems using the interface.\nThe main navigation controls in the program included a paging model which enabled the\nuser to go backwards or forwards one screen, or to jump to the start or end of the current\nsection. It is also possible to jump to a list of modules; progress being indicated by 'ticks'\nbeside the title of each visited module, giving the student freedom to enter or exit the\npackage as they see fit.\nThe role of CAL in the curriculum\nOne of the most frequent responses in the student questionnaire from the first cohort was\nthat 'the program should be used as a companion to lectures, not as a replacement'. This\nresponse did not figure in the responses by the second cohort of students. This initial\nreaction to veterinary CAL has been observed previously in the United States (Weeks,\nSmith and Martin, 1992).\nWhere use has been monitored in the CLFVE institutions, it has been observed that\nstudents are motivated to use courseware if its use is timetabled, or recommended to\ncoincide with particular lectures, practicals, or resource-based learning, i.e. integrated into\nthe curriculum. Further scheduled CAL time, in addition to free access, was considered to\nbe beneficial to students, as it has been argued that access to courseware in timetabled\nclasses facilitates collaboration between students (Doughty et ah, 1995).\nHowever, an increasing number of students are running CLIVE programs on home\ncomputers; this is shown by the increasing number of requests for overnight borrowing of\nCDROMs from the University of Glasgow veterinary library. The Dearing Report has\nrecommended that all students should have access to their own portable computers by\n83\nV. H. M. Dale et a\\ Computer-assisted learning as an alternative t o didactic lectures\n2005\/6 (National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, 1997). This will make\nCAL more accessible to the small number of students who commented that they did not\nlike working in a 'noisy' computer cluster, and will satisfy more of those students who\nprefer to study at home.\nStudents generally prefer to use courseware for preparation and revision and the\nimportance of CAL as an additional learning resource at the University of Glasgow has\nbeen exemplified by repeated requests for additional courseware covering a range of\nveterinary topics. The initial preference for CAL as a supplementary aid to learning may be\nexplained by the feeling of deprivation induced by the lack of classical (didactic) lectures,\nand the novelty of CAL, where the onus is placed on the student rather than the teacher to\ndrive the learning process.\nAttitudes to CAL\nStudents were told at the start of the academic year that they would be examined on their\nknowledge of the subject. Assessment has long been recognized elsewhere as the sole\nmotivation for using a resource which might be regarded as optional, but this may also\nengender negative feelings towards it (Scanlon, Jones and O'Shea, 1987). It is relevant to\nnote that the initial negative opinions of the students in the first cohort diametrically\nopposed the responses from a peer review survey. Peers, compared to students, are likely to\nhave a clearer idea of the educational imperatives and the desired outcome. This view is\nsupported by Draper, Brown, Henderson and McAteer (1996) who noted that 'Students\nexpress quite strongly positive and negative views about a piece of courseware that often\nseem unrelated to their actual educational value'.\nOther factors which may have influenced how CAL was received by the first cohort of\nstudents as a replacement for lectures are (i) the students in the first cohort had no formal\ntraining in IT, (ii) the subject was examinable, and (iii) the previous group of fourth-year\nstudents were given lectures. For the following two cohorts, CAL had already replaced\nlectures and the majority of students had more experience of using computers, although\nthis was still variable.\nA higher proportion of the second cohort of students enjoyed using the program,\ncompared with the first cohort. This may be due to the fact that integration had been\nachieved and CAL was now accepted as part of the course. A smaller proportion of\nstudents in the third year claimed to have enjoyed the program than in the second year, but\nmore students found the courseware modules useful.\nExamination analysis\nThe investigation of the variance of scores indicates that in the pre-CAL years, student\nperformance in diagnostic imaging was either on a par with other subjects, or significantly\nbelow the other subjects. In the post-CAL examinations, student performance in diag-\nnostic imaging was significantly higher than in other topics, and exclusively the highest in\nthe most recent examination.\nThis would imply that the replacement of introductory lectures with CAL has improved\nstudent performance in this subject, despite initial reluctance by students to accept the\nchange in learning methods. There are a number of possible reasons for the high diagnostic\nimaging scores in the post-CAL examinations. The most pessimistic is that given the\n84\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nperceived adverse change in course structure students compensated by working harder\n(Draper et al., 1996), using other resources in a remedial fashion. This might assume that\nall students considered the change adverse; however, this was not borne out by the\nquestionnaire responses. The possibility that the questions were easier, or that the papers\ncould have been marked more leniently, in the three years post-CAL is unlikely since the\nsame person set and marked the examination papers each year. The most favourable\nexplanation would be that the change in learning resources did help the students to learn at\ntheir own pace and fostered deep learning. This enabled them to apply their knowledge of\nfacts derived from using the courseware to the rest of the course, e.g. radiopathology\ntutorials, and engage in collaborative dialogue with each other and the teacher during film-\nreading sessions.\nConclusion\nThe key issues to emerge for the future of CAL in the veterinary curriculum are\novercoming initial student resistance, clear full integration into the curriculum, and\nmaking courseware available outside traditional scheduled timetables. The fact that design\nand navigation were not an issue indicated that a well designed package could be extended\nto CPD use, where users may not be particularly IT literate. The results of this study are\nvery encouraging and indicate that CAL-based open-learning resources can provide an\neffective alternative to conventional lectures.\nAcknowledgements\nV. H. M.
