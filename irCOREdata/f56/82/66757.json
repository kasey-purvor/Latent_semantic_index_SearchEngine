Introduction\nThe widely studied Southern Uplands terrane in the\nCaledonian orogen of Scotland (Fig. 1a) forms part of\na broad belt of Palaeozoic deformation that resulted\nfrom the sinistral oblique closure of the Iapetus Ocean\n(Dewey & Shackleton, 1984; Soper & Hutton, 1984;\nSoper et al. 1992). Numerous studies have docu-\nmented the structures present in this terrane in some\ndetail, notably in Northern Ireland (e.g. Anderson &\nCameron, 1979; Anderson & Oliver, 1986; Anderson,\n1987), southwestern Scotland (e.g. Stringer & Treagus,\n1980, 1981; Anderson & Oliver, 1986; Kemp, 1986,\n1987; Barnes, Anderson & McCurry, 1987; Stone,\n1995, 1996; Lintern & Floyd, 2000) and inland regions\nof the Southern Uplands (e.g. Barnes, Phillips &\nBoland, 1995; Phillips et al. 1995; Stone, 1996).\nHowever, with the exception of the detailed BGS\nmemoir (Greig, 1988), there are few modern published\naccounts of the well-exposed section of deformed\nSilurian rocks exposed along the Berwickshire coast-\nline in southeastern Scotland (Fig. 1b). Holdsworth \net al. (2002) have recently published a detailed descrip-\ntion of the structural geology of the Eyemouth to\nBurnmouth section (Fig. 1b) where they document\nevidence for strain partitioning during bulk sinistral\ntranspression leading to a complex and highly\ndomainal style of deformation. The present paper\ngives an account of the structures in the northernmost\ncoastal section of Berwickshire between Fast Castle &\nPettico Wick. The relatively simple pattern of neutral-\nto slightly NW-verging, cylindroidal folding contrasts\nsharply with the more complex transpressional defor-\nmation seen in the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section that\nlies only 5 km to the south. These findings have impli-\ncations concerning the structural and tectonostrati-\ngraphic continuity of the Southern Uplands terrane \nand shed further light on the regional significance of\nNW-directed movements in this otherwise SE-directed\nzone of overthrusting.\n2.

The\nupward-facing, upright to NW-vergent folds and associated structures appear to record a single\nregional phase of subhorizontal NW\u2013SE contractional deformation, with a steeply dipping direction\nof bulk finite extension. These structures are markedly different from those developed in rocks corre-\nlated with the Upper Llandovery Hawick Group exposed some 5 km to the south in the\nEyemouth\u2013Burnmouth coastal section. Here a highly domainal system of sinistral transpressional\nstrain occurs, with zones of steeply plunging curvilinear folds, clockwise cleavage transection and \nbedding-parallel sinistral detachment faults. The markedly different bulk strain patterns in the\nBerwickshire coastal sections are thought to reflect the regionally diachronous nature of transpres-\nsional deformation in the Southern Uplands terrane. There are striking similarities in the structures\nrecognized in the Berwickshire coastal sections and those developed in stratigraphically equivalent\nunits along strike in southwestern Scotland and Northern Ireland. This confirms the lateral structural\ncontinuity and correlation of tracts and tract boundaries along the entire length of the Southern\nUplands terrane. The regional structure suggests that a phase of top-to-the-NW backthrusting and\nbackfolding associated with the southern margin of the Gala Group outcrop marks the transition\nfrom orthogonal contraction to sinistral transpression in the Southern Upland thrust wedge during\nlate Llandovery times.\nKeywords: Southern Uplands, Caledonides, folding, transpression, tectonic wedges.\n\u2021 Author for correspondence: R.E.Holdsworth@durham.ac.uk\nby steeply dipping faults that mostly originated as top-\nto-the-SE thrusts (Fig. 1a; McKerrow, Leggett &\nEales, 1977). In general, the younging direction of the\nsteeply dipping rocks entrained within each thrust\nslice is to the northwest, whilst the age range of strata\nwithin each fault-bounded tract becomes progressively\nyounger to the southeast. Thus the Northern Belt \nof the Southern Uplands comprises exclusively\nOrdovician rocks whilst the Central and Southern\nbelts are mainly or exclusively Silurian strata (Fig. 1a;\nPeach & Horne, 1899). Complex systems of mainly\nSE-verging folds and associated top-to-the-SE thrusts\nare recognized throughout much the Southern\nUplands (e.g. Knipe & Needham, 1986; Knipe et al.\n1988) and are thought to have formed at relatively\nshallow crustal depths (< 10 km) based on the rela-\ntively low metamorphic grade (diagenetic to prehnite\u2013\npumpellyite facies) (Oliver & Leggett, 1980; Kemp,\nOliver & Baldwin, 1985).\nTwo main regional tectonic models have been pro-\nposed to explain the development of the thrust wedge:\n(1) an accretionary prism hypothesis in which the\nimbricated fault tracts are progressively scraped off\nthe down-going plate at a long-lived subduction zone\non the northern margin of the Lower Palaeozoic\nIapetus Ocean (e.g. McKerrow, Leggett & Eales, 1977;\nLeggett, McKerrow & Eales, 1979; Leggett, 1987); and\n(2) a model in which the region forms part of a back-\narc to foreland basin thrust system related to early\nSilurian arc\u2013continent collision (e.g. Stone et al. 1987;\nHutton & Murphy, 1987). Both models require that\nthe thrust-related structures are regionally diachro-\nnous, with those in the northwest forming significantly\nearlier than those in the southeast. This is supported\nby existing biostratigraphic and radiometric data\nwhich suggest that the onset of thrusting ranges from\nthe Ashgill in the northwest through to the Wenlock in\nthe southeast (Barnes, Lintern & Stone, 1989). In addi-\ntion to the contractional deformation, a regional com-\nponent of sinistral shear becomes important during\ndeformation from the late Llandovery onwards\n(Anderson & Oliver, 1986; Anderson, 1987; Barnes,\nLintern & Stone, 1989).\n2.b. The Lower Palaeozoic rocks of southeastern Scotland\nIn southeastern Scotland, the mainly Silurian strata of\nthe Southern Uplands terrane crop out in three areas,\nall of which are exposed along the Berwickshire coast\n(Fig. 1b; Greig, 1988). The rocks are all typical tur-\nbidite deposits, predominantly comprising interlay-\nered sequences of greywacke sandstones, siltstones\nand mudstones. They form the regional basement in\nsoutheastern Scotland and are often bounded by later,\nsteeply dipping faults, although unconformable rela-\ntionships with overlying Devonian and younger sedi-\nmentary rocks and extrusive lavas are locally preserved\n(e.g. Hutton\u2019s unconformity at Siccar Point; Fig. 1b).\nThe turbidites exposed in the northernmost coastal\nsection from Siccar Point to Pettico Wick are thought\nto be of Llandovery age based upon preserved grapto-\nlite fauna (Greig, 1988). The present study focuses on\nthe best exposed part of this section between Fast\nCastle and Pettico Wick (Fig. 2). To the north and\nwest of Fast Castle, much of the coastal section is par-\nallel to strike, is poorly exposed or disrupted by later\nfaulting. All the Silurian rocks exposed along the\nnorthernmost coastal section are correlated by Greig\n(1988) with the Gala Group in the southwestern part\nof the Southern Uplands outcrop (Fig. 1a, b). Some\n5 km to the south, the coastal section from Eyemouth\nto Burnmouth preserves an apparently unfossiliferous\nturbidite sequence that is generally correlated with the\n708 R.E.

An intervening\ncentral coastal section centred around Linkim Shore\n(Fig. 1b) exposes greywackes and shales of the\nColdingham and Linkim beds which are thought to be\nof Wenlock age based on poorly preserved faunal and\nmicrofaunal evidence (e.g. see Molyneux, 1987). These\nrocks are highly disrupted by soft-sediment deforma-\ntion structures and are of significantly lower meta-\nmorphic grade compared to the Silurian rocks in the\nadjacent coastal sections (Oliver et al. 1984). This \nsuggests that these rocks may have formed in a very\nshallow part of the thrust wedge where the effects of\ndown-slope, gravity-induced deformation were domi-\nnant. They are not considered further in the present\nstudy.\nA major tract boundary must lie somewhere to the\nsouth of the Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section to sepa-\nrate these rocks correlated with the Gala Group from\nthose of the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section correlated\nwith the Hawick Group (e.g. Fig. 1b). This structure\npresumably corresponds to the along-strike projection\nof the Laurieston Fault which is recognized in south-\nwestern Scotland (Fig. 1a; Akhurst et al. 2001). The\nnormal fault that currently separates the Silurian base-\nment south of Eyemouth from the Devonian and\nCarboniferous rocks to the north (Fig. 1b) may well\nreactivate this tract-bounding structure.\nIn the following section, the geometric and kinematic\ncharacteristics of the well-exposed structures seen in\nthe Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section are summarized\nand interpreted. All the Silurian rocks are typical \nStructures in the Gala Group, Southern Uplands 709\nFigure 2.

They preserve abundant way-up cri-\nteria, including graded bedding, cross-laminations,\nsole markings (mainly flutes and grooves), load casts\nand ripple marks (Greig, 1988). This is significant as it\nallows a detailed analysis and comparison of fold and\ncleavage facing patterns to be carried out in addition\nto a standard orientation analysis using stereographic\nprojections. Facing is here defined (following\nShackleton, 1957; Holdsworth, 1988) as \u2018the direction,\nnormal to the fold axis\/cleavage\u2013bedding intersection\nlineation, along the fold axial\/cleavage plane and\ntowards the younger beds\u2019.

(2002).\n3. The Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section\n3.a.

All folds and the associ-\nated cleavage face steeply upwards (Fig. 4b). The rela-\ntive simplicity of the folding is illustrated by the clear\ngirdle distribution of poles to bedding (stereoplot i,\nFig. 4a) that defines a subhorizontal, NE\u2013SW regional\nb axis which corresponds closely with the mean fold\nhinge orientation. Associated axial surfaces have NE\nto ENE trends and dip steeply to the NW or SE (stereo-\nplot ii, Fig. 4a). The folds in the western\u2013northwestern\npart of the section are more upright and symmetric\n(Fig. 3a), whilst those to the east\u2013southeast are more\nasymmetric and overturned northwestwards (Figs 2b,\n3b; Sheills & Dearman, 1966). The structurally lowest\nand presumably oldest rocks are exposed in a major\nanticlinal closure near Souter (fold 4 in Fig. 2a, b),\nStructures in the Gala Group, Southern Uplands 711\nFigure 4.

In addition, the scarcity of NW-facing fold data reflects the relatively inaccessible nature of the south-\neastern part of the cliff section where most NW-verging folds occur (see Fig. 2b).\n712 R.E.

Viewed in fold profile plane. It is suggested that the cleavage is locally coaxially refolded due to\nmigration of the fold hinges to produce local downward facing relationships in S1; note also minor SE-vergent folding of cleav-\nage in regions of hinge migration.

On a\nregional scale, the folds verge slightly to the NW, with\napproximately 60 % of the exposed strata younging to\nthe SE. In the less accessible, southern part of the sec-\ntion (e.g. south of fold 10 in Fig. 2b), the proportion of\nsoutherly younging strata rises to near 75 % and\nalmost all of the folds verge markedly NW.\nA weakly developed slaty to spaced-solution cleav-\nage is present in many mudstone and siltstone hori-\nzons (Fig. 3c). No mineral lineations are visible in\nexposed cleavage surfaces. Over much of the outcrop,\nthe cleavage exhibits an axial planar or gently fanning\nrelationship to the folds. There are no clear examples\nof transection and cleavage\u2013bedding intersection lin-\neations are regionally and locally parallel to fold axes\n(Fig. 3d; stereoplot iii in Fig. 4a). The synclinal fold \nat Pettico Wick (fold 21 in Fig. 2) exhibits a more \ncomplex relationship to the cleavage in which the pre-\nsent fold hinge zone does not correspond to the loca-\ntion where the cleavage\u2013bedding relationship changes\n(Fig. 5a). As a result the cleavage is locally coaxially\nrefolded around SE-dipping parts of the fold hinge\nregion, hence spreading poles to cleavage planes along\na girdle normal to the regional fold axis (stereoplots i\nand ii, Fig. 5b). Thus, the cleavage locally faces side-\nways or downwards to the SE (Fig. 5a, c). These rela-\ntionships are attributed to hinge migration during fold\ntightening (as indicated in Fig. 5a). It is unclear why\nthis feature appears to be restricted entirely to the\nextreme east\u2013southeast of the coastal section.\nFaults are widespread, but are generally minor\nstructures in terms of displacement and are often asso-\nciated with minor amounts of carbonate mineraliza-\ntion. Conjugate thrust faults dipping NW and SE are\ncommon in some disrupted fold hinge regions (see\nGreig, 1988, pp. 11\u201313 for details). In all fold limb\nregions, bedding-parallel shears with well-defined \ncarbonate slickenfibres are ubiquitous and are distrib-\nuted along a girdle orthogonal to the regional fold axis\nand parallel to the fold profile plane (stereoplot iv, Fig.\n4a). Senses of shear deduced from slickenfibre steps\nand offsets of markers are reversed on opposite fold\nlimbs and are everywhere consistent with a flexural\nslip model (e.g. Ramsay & Huber, 1987, fig. 21.11).\nThe youngest group of structures are steeply dipping,\npossible conjugate, strike-slip faults that everywhere\ncross-cut the folded bedding. Sinistral faults trend\nmainly NNE\u2013SSW whilst dextral faults trend\nNW\u2013SE. Collectively, the faults appear to be consis-\ntent with NNW\u2013SSE bulk contractional strain (Greig,\n1988). The age of this faulting is uncertain and may be\nlate Caledonian (cf. Stone, 1995) or be related to\nyounger deformation episodes such as the Variscan\ninversion of the Northumberland basin that lies to the\nsouth (e.g. Roper, 1997).\n3.b. Interpretation of structures and comparison with regions\nalong strike\nThe upward-facing, upright to slightly NW-vergent\nfolds and associated structures of the Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section appear to be consistent with \nsubhorizontal NW\u2013SE contractional deformation. A\nsteeply dipping direction of bulk finite extension can\nbe inferred by bisecting the arc of the slightly curvilin-\near subhorizontal fold hinges. There is no evidence for\ncleavage transection of the folds that also exhibit bed-\nding-parallel shears with hinge-normal slickenfibre\nlineations thought to be related to flexural slip during\nfolding. Faults are relatively unimportant features\ncompared to folds and many small-scale conjugate\nthrust faults appear to have formed during flexural-\nslip folding of local multilayer sequences in which the\nthickness of individual competent sandstone units is\nvariable leading to strain compatibility problems \n(cf. Ramsay, 1974).\nThe slight NW vergence of the folds and predomi-\nnance of SE-younging directions in the Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section, particularly in its southern part\n(Figs 2b, 3b), is atypical of the general NW-younging\nand markedly SE structural vergence recognized\nthroughout much of the Southern Uplands terrane\n(e.g. McKerrow, Leggett & Eales, 1977; Knipe &\nNeedham, 1986). However, very similar structural\nassemblages, with significant areas of SE-younging\nstrata, are seen in units of the Gala Group rocks of the\nWigtown, Rhins of Galloway (southwestern Scotland)\nand Ards peninsula (Northern Ireland) areas (e.g.\nBarnes, Anderson & McCurry, 1987; McCurry &\nAnderson, 1989; Stone, 1995). Significantly, these\nregions lie directly along strike of the Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section, an observation that seems to \nconfirm the general along-strike structural continuity\nand correlation of tracts and tract boundaries along\nthis part of the Southern Uplands terrane (e.g. Fig. 1a).\n4. Discussion\n4.a. Comparison with the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section\nLying some 5 km to the south of the Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section, the 4 km long coastline to the\nsouth of Eyemouth harbour (Fig. 1b) preserves an\nStructures in the Gala Group, Southern Uplands 713\norientations also shown.

The rocks are apparently\ndevoid of fossils, but are generally assigned to the\nUpper Llandovery Hawick Group based on lithologi-\ncal similarities with these rocks in their type locality in\nsouthwestern Scotland (Greig, 1988).\nThe structure of the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section\nis described in some detail by Holdsworth et al. (2002).\nIn overview, this section differs from the Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section in several important respects:\n(1) Compared to the highly folded Fast Castle\u2013\nPettico Wick section (Fig. 2b; stereoplot i in Fig. 4a),\nthe Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth sequence is a more homo-\nclinal NW-dipping and -younging sequence with local\nregions of generally S-vergent folding (Sheills &\nDearman, 1966; Holdsworth et al. 2002).\n(2) In contrast to the subhorizontal NE\u2013SW whale-\nback-geometry folds of the Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick\nsection (stereoplot ii, Fig. 4a), fold hinges are\nmarkedly curvilinear, particularly in more northerly\nparts of the section close to Eyemouth, where they\nlocally exhibit in excess of 110\u00b0 of plunge variation\nwithin their axial surfaces (Dearman, Shiells &\nLarwood, 1962; Treagus, 1992; Holdsworth et al.\n2002).\n(3) The weakly developed, steeply dipping slaty to\nspaced solution cleavage is axial planar to the folds in\nthe Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section (stereoplots ii\nand iii, Fig. 4a). In the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth out-\ncrop, however, both bedding\u2013cleavage intersection \nlineations and poles to cleavage planes exhibit local\nclockwise transection in the northern parts of the \nsection near to Eyemouth harbour (Holdsworth et al.\n2002).\n(4) In stark contrast to the simple upward facing\npatterns of the Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section (Fig.\n4b), fold and cleavage facing directions in the\nEyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section collectively exhibit\napproximately 270\u00b0 of variation from sideways NE-,\nthrough upward- to SW sideways- and downward-\nfacing (Holdsworth et al. 2002). This is a direct conse-\nquence of the locally highly curvilinear character of\nthe folds (cf. Dearman, Sheills & Larwood, 1962).\n(5) Flexural-slip slickenlines associated with bed-\nding-parallel shears are parallel to the profile plane in\nthe Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section (stereoplot iv,\nFig. 4a), whilst those from folded regions in the\nEyemouth\u2013Burnmouth area lie in a common plane\nsignificantly anticlockwise of the profile plane (see\nHoldsworth et al. 2002, fig. 4). This seems to suggest\nthat oblique flexural-slip occurred during folding in\nmost, if not all of, that section.\n(6) Faults are more widespread in the Eyemouth\u2013\nBurnmouth section and include conjugate thrust\nfaults in disrupted fold hinge regions, bedding-parallel\nshears in fold limbs and interlinked networks of\ndetachment faults lying at low-angles or sub-parallel\nto bedding. Carbonate slickenfibres along all of these\nshears and faults exhibit variable and locally complex\nmovements, but those lying at low angles to strike\nalways display a sinistral sense of movement\n(Holdsworth et al. 2002).\n(7) Holdsworth et al. (2002) delimit a number of\nNE\u2013SW-trending fault-bounded domains in the\nnorthern part of the Eyemouth coastal section that\nexhibit very different assemblages of structures which\nappear to be broadly all of the same age. This pattern\ncontrasts markedly with the uniformly folded struc-\nture observed between Fast Castle and Pettico Wick.\nCollectively, all the features of the Eyemouth\u2013\nBurnmouth section are interpreted by Holdsworth et\nal. (2002) to indicate components of NW\u2013SE contrac-\ntion, top-to-the-SW sinistral shear and lesser amounts\nof top-to-the-SE thrusting, that is, bulk triclinic sinis-\ntral transpression. The domains exhibiting different\nstructural assemblages are thought to represent\nregions of contraction- and sinistral wrench-domi-\nnated strain. Such features are widely recognized in\ntranspression zones and are thought to form due to\nkinematic partitioning of strain into orogen-parallel\nand orogen-normal components (e.g. Dewey,\nHoldsworth & Strachan, 1998, and references therein).\nSimilar structural assemblages have been described\nalong-strike and to the southwest in the Southern\nUplands terrane, notably in the Hawick Group rocks\nof the Wigtown Peninsula and Kirkcudbright areas of\nsouthwestern Scotland (e.g. Kemp, 1987; Barnes,\nAnderson & McCurry, 1987; Stone, 1995, 1996;\nLintern & Floyd, 2000). Once again, this seems to con-\nfirm the structural continuity and correlation of tracts\nalong the entire length of the Southern Uplands ter-\nrane (e.g. Fig. 1a).\n4.b. Regional implications\nIn addition to the contractional deformation recog-\nnized throughout the Southern Uplands terrane, a\nregional component of sinistral shear becomes impor-\ntant during deformation from the late Llandovery\nonwards (Anderson & Oliver, 1986; Anderson, 1987;\nBarnes, Lintern & Stone, 1989). In the northwestern\nparts of the thrust wedge, sinistral fault- and shear-\nzones, often with associated, steeply plunging late\nfolds (\u2018F3\u2019) are superimposed upon pre-existing con-\ntractional structures (\u2018F1\u2013F2\u2019) including tract-bo\nunding early thrusts such as the Orlock Bridge Fault\n(Fig. 6; Anderson & Oliver, 1986). However, in the\nfrontal parts of the thrust wedge developed from the\nmid- to late Llandovery onwards (Hawick Group\nrocks and younger; Fig. 6), the sinistral shear becomes\nincreasingly synchronous with initial accretion as a\nresult of the diachronous nature of the deformation.\n714 R.E. H O L D S WO RT H, E.TAVA R N E L L I & P. C L E G G\nThus, rocks in the most southeasterly fault tracts in the\nSouthern Uplands, including those of the Eyemouth\u2013\nBurnmouth section in Berwickshire, are often charac-\nterized by sinistral transpressional primary (\u2018F1\u2019) fold\nbelts with clockwise cleavage transection and local\nsteeply plunging hinges with sinistral fold vergence\n(e.g. Stringer & Treagus, 1980; Anderson, 1987; Kemp,\n1987; Holdsworth et al. 2002).\nThe absence of any clear evidence for sinistral shear\nin the Fast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section has two possi-\nble explanations. Either these structures formed prior\nto the onset of regional sinistral transpression in the\nSouthern Uplands, or the transpressional strain was\nhighly partitioned so that the Gala Group rocks of the\nFast Castle\u2013Pettico Wick section lie in a large domain\nof contraction-dominated deformation. The latter\nexplanation requires that these structures have an\nequivalent history to those in the regions of contrac-\ntion-dominated deformation in the Hawick Group\nrocks of the Eyemouth\u2013Burnmouth section (e.g.\ndomain 2 of Holdsworth et al. 2002). Whilst the folds\nin the latter domains are upright NE\u2013SW structures\nwith gentle whaleback hinges, they are clearly clock-\nwise transected by the cleavage, and the bedding-\nparallel flexural slip slickenline lineations lie in a plane\nsignificantly anticlockwise of the profile plane. These\ncharacteristic features are not observed in the Fast\nCastle\u2013Pettico Wick section and we suggest, therefore,\nthat the main fold structures in the Gala Group rocks\nof Berwickshire formed prior to the onset of regional\nsinistral shear in the Southern Uplands.\nThe Southern Uplands terrane is dominated by\nstructures that verge towards the SE. However, NW-\nvergent folds have been recognized in several locations\nadjacent to the southern margin of the Gala Group in\nboth Northern Ireland and southwestern Scotland\n(Fig. 6; Barnes, Anderson & McCurry, 1987; McCurry\n& Anderson, 1989; Stone, 1995). Barnes, Anderson &\nMcCurry (1987) and Stone (1995) propose that the\ngeometry of these structures is consistent with a short-\nlived phase of backthrusting that may have occurred\ndue to changes in the rheology of the thrust wedge \nor its basal detachment. In contrast, McCurry &\nAnderson (1989) suggest that the onset of NW-\ndirected shearing reflects a switch from subduction\n(with SE-directed shear) to obduction, possibly in\nresponse to increased sedimentation rates in the late\nLlandovery. This explanation seems to be at odds with\nthe biostratigraphical relationships (see Stone, 1995,\npp. 52\u20133). Our findings do not resolve this controversy,\nalthough they seem to confirm the regional extent of\nthis NW-directed deformation event in rocks adjacent\nto the southern margin of the Gala Group (Fig. 6). We\nsuggest, however, that the timing of deformation\nevents may also be significant because the backthrust-\ning occurs in Gala Group rocks that were likely\ndeformed immediately prior to the onset of regional\nsinistral shear in the late Llandovery (Fig. 6; Stone \net al. 1987; Barnes, Lintern & Stone, 1989; Stone,\n1996; Holdsworth et al. 2002). Thus the phase of\nbackthrusting in the Southern Uplands thrust wedge\ncoincides with a change in kinematic boundary condi-\ntions from a regime of orthogonal contraction to one\nof sinistral transpression in a southward migrating\ndeformation system. This change is conceivably linked\nto the accretion of a microcontinental or arc fragment\nproposed by Rushton, Stone & Hughes (1996). Our\nfindings, taken together with those of Holdsworth et al.\n(2002), entirely support recent suggestions that the late\nLlandovery was a key period in the evolution of the\nSouthern Uplands terrane (e.g. Akhurst et al. 2001)\nand further highlight the regional importance of the\nLaurieston Fault (Fig. 6).\nAcknowledgements.
