Moreover, the probability of a correct majority judgment approaches certainty as \nthe jury size increases. This result is a consequence of the law of large numbers: From \nmany independent but noisy signals, majority voting can extract the information while \nfiltering out the noise.  \nThis insight, which has become known as \u201cCondorcet\u2019s jury theorem\u201d, has sparked a \nlarge body of social-scientific work on the reliability of various decision procedures in \njuries, committees, legislatures, electorates and other settings (e.g., Grofman et al. 1983, \nBorland 1989, Austen-Smith and Banks 1996, List and Goodin 2001, List 2004). While \nthe original theorem highlights the benefits of pooling independent information held by \nmultiple individuals, a complexity arises in collective decisions when voting is \nsupplemented by communication, as investigated by the theory of deliberative democracy \n(e.g., Elster 1986, Miller 1992, Knight and Johnson 1994, Dryzek and List 2003, Austen-\nSmith and Feddersen forthcoming). Communication can create interdependencies \nbetween decision-makers. On the one hand, these may facilitate information pooling and \nfiltering (e.g., Luskin et al. 2002, Farrar et al. forthcoming), but on the other, they may \nalso lead to the amplification of certain errors, such as in fads and informational \ncascades, as briefly discussed at the end of this paper (e.g., Bikhchandani et al. 1992, \nZuber et al. 1992, Sunstein 2002, 2006).  \nIn this paper, we consider an intriguing non-human case of information pooling \ncombined with communication: the case of nest-site choice by honey bee swarms. We \npresent a new theoretical model of the honey bees\u2019 collective decision process and \ninvestigate the role played by both information pooling and communication in it. \nIt is a long-standing empirical fact that, in late spring or early summer, a colony of honey \nbees that has reached a certain size tends to divide itself: the queen leaves with roughly \ntwo thirds of the worker bees, and a daughter queen stays behind in the parental nest with \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 3 \nthe rest of the worker bees. How does the swarm that has left the colony find a new \nhome? Empirical work by Lindauer (1955) and Seeley et al. (2006) has revealed a \nmechanism involving a \u201csearch committee\u201d of several hundred bees \u2013 the scouts \u2013 who \nfly out to inspect potential nest sites and then come back and perform waggle dances to \nadvertise any good sites they have discovered. Initially, the scouts visit and inspect sites \nrandomly, but once the dancing activity has built up, they are more likely to visit and \ninspect the sites advertised by others. Back at the swarm, each bee dances for the site she \nhas inspected, with the duration of the dance depending on her perception of the site\u2019s \nquality: the better the site, the longer the dance. Thus high-quality sites receive more \nadvertisement and are visited by more scout bees, which in turn generate even more \ndance activity for these sites. The process eventually leads to a \u201cconsensus\u201d: The dancing \nand visiting concentrates on one popular site, and the swarm moves there. (The bees\u2019 \nfinal decision to move appears to involve \u201cquorum sensing\u201d, as discussed by Seeley and \nVisscher 2003.) The striking empirical fact is that, when different possible nest sites vary \nin quality, the bees usually choose the best one (Seeley and Buhrman 2001).  \nWhile the empirical details of this process are well understood, the mechanisms \nunderlying its striking reliability still lack a full explanation. Our model of the bees\u2019 \ndecision making is innovative in combining two features: first, it is agent-based, in the \nsense that we explicitly model the individual behaviour of each scout as a simple \nstochastic process, and second and more importantly, it integrates insights from \nCondorcet\u2019s jury theorem with insights from the theory of deliberative democracy. Using \ncomputer simulations based on this model, we are able to predict that, under a wide range \nof parameter conditions, a consensus among the bees emerges for the best nest site with a \nhigh probability, even when the quality differences between sites are relatively small. \nFurthermore, we show that the remarkable reliability of the bees\u2019 decision process stems \nfrom a particular interplay of independence and interdependence between the bees, as \ndefined formally below. \nOther mathematical models of nest-site choice by honey bees are a differential-equation \nmodel by Britton et al. (2002), a matrix model by Myerscough (2003), another agent-\nbased model by Passino and Seeley (2006), and a density-dependent Markov process \nmodel by Perdriau and Myerscough (2007). While shedding light on several important \naspects of the bees\u2019 decision process, none of these models exhibits both main \ncharacteristics of ours, i.e., being agent-based and explicitly modelling the interplay \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 4 \nbetween independence and interdependence. Moreover, our model is particularly \nparsimonious and makes very robust predictions. Since our computational results appear \nto be consistent with existing empirical findings about the bees, we suggest that our \nmodel adequately captures some key elements of the bees\u2019 decision-making process. \nThe paper is structured as follows. After a formal exposition of our model, we state our \ntwo main hypotheses about the bees\u2019 decision process. The first is, roughly, that this \nprocess is robustly reliable for a large class of parameter conditions, and the second that \nthe presence of both independence and interdependence between individual bees is \nnecessary and sufficient for the overall reliability. Methodologically, both hypotheses are \nformulated as hypotheses about our model of the bees rather than as hypotheses about the \nreal-world bees themselves; but to the extent that the model behaviour is consistent with \nthe empirically observed behaviour of the bees, our hypotheses can be considered \nempirically adequate as well. To provide a computational test of our hypotheses, we \nfinally report our computer simulations, followed by a brief concluding discussion. \nMODEL \nBasic ingredients of the model \nThere are n scout bees, labelled 1, 2, \u2026, n, who participate in the decision-making \nprocess, and there are k potential nest sites, labelled 1, 2, \u2026, k, where each nest site j has \nan objective quality qj \u2265 0. We assume discrete time periods, labelled 1, 2, 3, \u2026, and \nexplicitly model the behaviour of all n individual scout bees in each period. \nAt each time, a scout bee can be in one of two states: either she dances for one of the k \npotential nest sites, or she does not dance for any site, which can mean that she has not \nyet found a site, she has flown out to search for sites, she is observing other bees, or she \nis resting. Formally, the state of bee i at time t is represented by a two-component vector \nxi,t = (si,t,di,t), where \n\u2022 si,t\u2208{0,1,2,\u2026,k} is the site for which bee i dances at time t, with si,t = 0 \nmeaning that she does not dance at time t, and  \n\u2022 di,t \u2265 0 is the remaining duration of bee i\u2019s dance at time t. \nWe initialize the model by assuming there is no dancing activity at time 1, i.e., for all i, \nxi,1 = (0,0). \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 5 \nHow each bee changes her state from one time period to the next \nAs in any agent-based model, the state of bee i at time t+1 depends on her own state at \ntime t and the state of other bees at time t. We need to distinguish between two cases: \nEither bee i does not dance for any site at time t, in which case she may or may not fly \nout and find a site to dance for at time t+1. Or she already dances for one of the sites at \ntime t, in which case she continues her dance at time t+1 unless its duration is over. We \nnow discuss each case in turn. \nCase 1: Bee i does not dance for any site at time t (i.e., si,t = 0).  \nIn this case, she has a certain probability of flying to one of the k sites and inspecting it. \nFor each site j, we write pj,t+1 to denote the probability that the bee finds site j and dances \nfor it at time t+1. Further, p0,t+1 denotes the probability that the bee remains at rest or \nfinds no site, so that she does not dance at time t+1. Thus the first component of the bee\u2019s \nstate at time t+1, namely si,t+1, takes the values 1, 2, \u2026, k (one of the sites) or 0 (no site) \nwith probabilities p1,t+1, p2,t+1, \u2026, pk,t+1 and p0,t+1, respectively. By definition, these \nprobabilities add up to 1. \nHow are the probabilities determined? The probability that a bee finds a given site \ndepends on two factors: first, an a priori probability of how likely she is to find that site \nwithout any advertisement by other bees (this may depend on the site\u2019s location, distance \nfrom the swarm etc.), and second, the proportion of bees dancing for it. Formally, for \neach j (including the case j = 0 of no site), we define \n,)1(\n,1, tjjtj fp \u03bbpi\u03bb +\u2212=+  \nwhere pi\n j is the a priori probability of the jth site, fj,t is the proportion of bees dancing for \nsite j at time t, and \u03bb is the relevant weight, ranging between 0 and 1. The weight \n\u03bb captures the amount of interdependence between the bees. If \u03bb = 0, each bee\u2019s \nprobabilities of finding the various sites remain the a priori probabilities, regardless of \nhow many bees dance for them: this is the limiting case in which the bees do not \ninfluence each other at all through communication. If \u03bb = 1, by contrast, each bee\u2019s \nprobabilities of finding the various sites are perfectly proportional to the numbers of bees \ndancing for them: this is the opposite limiting case in which the bees\u2019 dancing completely \ndetermines all bees\u2019 decisions to inspect the various sites.  \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 6 \nIt remains to define the second component of bee i\u2019s state at time t+1, her dance duration \ndi,t+1 if she has begun a dance for one of the k sites, say site j. (If she has found no site, \ndi,t+1 is set to zero.) Initially, we assume that di,t+1 is always stochastically determined by \nthe bee\u2019s independent assessment of site j\u2019s true quality qj. Later, we allow that there is a \nprobability \u00b5 \u2265 0 that di,t+1 is unrelated to qj, so as to capture the possibility that the bee\u2019s \ndance is prompted by mimicking other bees rather than by an inspection of site j. A value \nof \u00b5 = 0 represents the original case in which bees always independently assess a site\u2019s \nquality before dancing for it, while a value of \u00b5 = 1 represents the opposite case in which \nbees join dances solely based on the probability distribution (p1,t+1,p2,t+1,\u2026, pk,t+1) over \nthe k sites and thus \u2013 given a sufficiently large value of \u03bb \u2013 based on mimicking the \ndances of others, without paying attention to any site\u2019s quality.

Under our definition, the bee\u2019s dance duration for \nany given site fluctuates around the numerical value of the site\u2019s true quality (setting \naside the case of mimicking, where the dance duration fluctuates around the quality-\nindependent constant K). The bee\u2019s error is multiplicative, i.e., an overestimation of the \nsite\u2019s quality by a factor of c > 0 \u2013 i.e., the bee erroneously takes the site\u2019s quality to be c \ntimes its true quality \u2013 is as likely as an underestimation by the same factor \u2013 i.e., she \ntakes the site\u2019s quality to be 1\/c times its true quality. Our results are robust to changes in \nthe functional form of the error; e.g., we obtain similar results when the error takes an \nadditive rather than multiplicative form. \nCase 2: Bee i dances for one of the sites \u2013 say site j \u2013 at time t (i.e., si,t > 0).  \nIn this case, she continues to dance for the same site at time t+1 with the remaining dance \ntime reduced by one period, unless that dance time is over; in the latter case, her state is \nre-set to the state of no dancing.

From the states of the \nn bees at each time, we can determine the total number of bees dancing for each site at \nthat time. Specifically, for each j (including the case j = 0 of no site), the number of bees \ndancing for site j at time t is  \n.}:{\n,,\njsin titj ==  \nNow different criteria of \u201cconsensus\u201d are conceivable. Generally, a consensus criterion \ncan be understood as a mapping from the individual-level pattern of dance activity to a \nchosen nest site. According to one such criterion, a consensus for a site j at a given time t \nwould require that all the bees engaged in dance activity at time t support site j, i.e., nj,t > \n0 while nh,t = 0 for all h \u2260 j with h \u2260 0. However, as shown by Seeley and Visscher \n(2003), a consensus in this unanimitarian sense is not necessary, nor even generally \nsufficient, for the bees\u2019 selection of a nest site. Instead, the bees appear to make decisions \nby \u201cquorum\u201d, requiring merely \u201csufficient\u201d support for a site to be chosen.  \nThis can be modelled in a number of different ways. For the present purposes, we focus \non two illustrative criteria. According to the first and less demanding criterion \u2013 which is \narguably too weak to capture the \u201cquorum\u201d requirement fully \u2013 site j is the winner at time \nt if it receives more support than any other site at t, i.e., nj,t > nh,t for any h \u2260 j with h \u2260 0. \nAccording to the second and more demanding criterion, site j is the winner at time t if it \nmeets a two-part condition: (i) it receives more than twice the amount of support received \nby the second most popular site (i.e., nj,t > 2nh,t for any h \u2260 j with h \u2260 0), and (ii) more \nthan 20% of the scout bees are engaged in dance activity at t (i.e., n0,t < 0.8n). \nOur model would also allow the use of other consensus criteria, but these would yield \nbroadly similar results about the bees\u2019 overall reliability. Differences between such \ncriteria would become more significant in relation to speed-accuracy trade-offs, which \nare not the focus of this paper.  \nHYPOTHESES \nSince our model is designed to represent the bees\u2019 empirically observed decision-making \nbehaviour, the model should predict the reliability of the bees\u2019 decision-process under \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 8 \nempirically realistic assumptions. What do we mean by \u201crealistic\u201d? It is reasonable to \nassume, first, that individual bees are neither very reliable nor completely unreliable, and \nsecond, that the bees\u2019 waggle dances have a significant but not exclusive influence on \nother bees\u2019 decisions to investigate potential nest sites. The first assumption corresponds \nto a non-extremal value of the bees\u2019 reliability parameter \u03c3, and the second to a non-\nextremal value of the interdependence parameter \u03bb. Initially, we assume no mimicking \nbetween the bees (i.e., \u00b5 = 0).\u0001We expect the following: \nHypothesis 1: Under a wide range of non-extremal parameter values of \u03c3 and \n\u03bb (and \u00b5 = 0), the bees choose the best nest site. \nAssuming this hypothesis turns out to be true \u2013 which is consistent with Seeley\u2019s \nempirical observations \u2013 we are also interested in explaining why this is the case. As \nalready indicated in the introduction, we suggest that two characteristics of the bees\u2019 \ndecision process stand out. First, the bees are independent in that they individually \ninspect potential nest sites and dance to advertise them as a function of their individual \nquality assessments of these sites; they do not blindly join a dance for a nest site without \nhaving inspected the site themselves (i.e., \u00b5 is zero or low). We can express this in the \nlanguage of probability theory by saying that, conditional on having identified a \nparticular site, each bee\u2019s dance duration for that site is independent of other bees\u2019 dance \ndurations for it. Second, the bees are interdependent in that they are more likely to \ninspect nest sites advertised by others (i.e., \u03bb is high). Expressed in probability-theoretic \nterms, the identification of a particular site by one bee is correlated with the identification \nof that site by others. We hypothesize that the reliability of the bees\u2019 decision process is \ndriven by the interplay of these two characteristics: \nHypothesis 2: The bees\u2019 independence in assessing the various sites\u2019 quality and \ntheir interdependence through communication are both necessary and sufficient for \nthe reliability of the bees\u2019 decision process. \nBoth hypotheses are deliberately stated informally here, but their operationalization will \nbecome clearer in the context of our computer simulations. \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 9 \nCOMPUTER SIMULATIONS \nBasic description \nImplementing the model above as a Mathematica programme, we ran a number of \ncomputer simulations of the bees\u2019 nest-site choice under various parameter conditions. \nTo ensure comparability across simulations, we fixed the number of scout bees at n = 200 \nand the number of potential nest sites at k = 5. These assumptions are empirically \nmotivated: there are usually several hundred scouts in a swarm, and there were typically \nfive candidate nest sites in the experiments conducted by Seeley and others on Appledore \nIsland, off the coast of Maine.  \nWe also fixed the objective quality levels q1, \u2026, q5 of the five nest sites at 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, \nrespectively, thus making it intuitively difficult for the bees to distinguish the two or \nthree best nest sites. (Even when individual reliability is high, e.g., \u03c3 = 0.2, the intervals \nin which individual quality assessments of the two best sites are likely to fall, namely  \n[9exp(-0.2), 9exp(0.2)] = [7.37, 10.99] and [10exp(-0.2), 10exp(0.2)] = [8.19, 12.21], \noverlap significantly. When individual reliability is lower, e.g., \u03c3 = 1, the overlap \nbetween these intervals, now [3.31, 24.46] and [3.68, 27.18], grows further.)  \nWe further assumed that when a bee flies out randomly without following any other bees\u2019 \nadvertisement for a site, she has a 25% percent probability of finding some site, where \nthe probability is equally distributed over the five sites (i.e., pi1 =  \u2026 = pi5 = 5%, and pi0 = \n75%). In all simulations, we calculated the bees\u2019 behaviour for 300 time periods, though \na consensus, under both criteria introduced above, often emerged in less time. We \nverified that our findings are robust to changes in the choice of these fixed parameters. \nOur first set of simulations was run to test hypothesis 1 by investigating the reliability of \nthe bees\u2019 decision process under a range of empirically motivated, non-extremal \nassumptions about individual bees\u2019 reliability (\u03c3) and their interdependence through \nsignalling (\u03bb), in each case assuming no mimicking (\u00b5 = 0). As reported below, our \nsimulations broadly confirm hypothesis 1.  \nOur second set of simulations was designed to test hypothesis 2, focusing on the \nmechanisms underlying the reliability of the bees\u2019 decision process. To isolate the effects \nof independent assessments of the various sites\u2019 quality by the bees and communicative \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 10\ninterdependence between them, we varied the parameters \u00b5 and \u03c3 such that one of these \ntwo characteristics was completely or partially absent from the bees\u2019 decision making.  \nTo model the full or partial absence of independence, we considered non-zero values of \n\u00b5, thereby allowing that a bee may join a dance for a site not on the basis of her \nindependent assessment of its quality but merely as a result of mimicking other bees \ndancing for it (we set the relevant constant K equal to the maximal nest-site quality, but \nother values of K would yield similar results). Recall that our original case \u00b5 = 0 meant \nthat bees always independently assess a site\u2019s quality before dancing for it. By contrast, \nthe higher the value of \u00b5, the less likely it is that a bee independently assesses a site\u2019s \nquality before dancing for it. In the limiting case \u00b5 = 1, bees join dances randomly, based \nonly on the probability distribution over sites, without paying attention to any site\u2019s \nquality (i.e., the dance duration is determined by the site-quality-independent random \nvariable Kexp(T\u03c3), as defined above). Our simulation results reported below are \nconsistent with hypothesis 2, showing that high values of \u00b5 undermine the reliability of \nthe bees\u2019 decision process, while low values support it. \nTo model the full or partial absence of interdependence between the bees, we varied the \nparameter \u03bb. As already noted, a value of zero implies that each bee\u2019s probabilities of \nfinding the various nest sites remain the a priori probabilities, regardless of other bees\u2019 \ndancing activity; a value of one implies that each bee\u2019s probabilities of finding those sites \nare perfectly proportional to the numbers of bees dancing for them; no other factors lead \na bee to inspect any site. Here, too, our simulation results are consistent with hypothesis \n2; low values of \u03bb undermine the reliability of the bees\u2019 decision process while high \nvalues reinforce it. An exception arises for the limiting case \u03bb = 1, where the bees\u2019 \nprobabilities of finding the different sites are given by the existing dance proportions for \nthose sites. Here there is not enough noise in the system for bees to discover any new \nsites not advertised by others. Small noisy deviations from perfect proportionality (i.e., \u03bb \n< 1) are necessary to permit the discovery of new sites. \nResults on hypothesis 1 \nOur first simulations capture what may be described as a best-case scenario: the \nreliability of bees in assessing sites is good (\u03c3 = 0.2), and their interdependence through \ncommunication is high (\u03bb = 0.8). Figure 1 shows an illustrative simulation for these \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 11\nparameter values. The figure shows the number of bees engaged in dance activity for \neach of the five nest sites at each of the 300 time periods calculated. It is easy to see that \nafter some initial amount of dance activity for other sites, the dance activity concentrates \non the best site (site 5). To confirm that this pattern is not accidental, we repeated the \nsimulation with the same parameter values 250 times. In each case, we determined the \nconsensus winner using the two illustrative criteria introduced above, applied to the last \ntime period of the simulation. Recall that according to the first and weaker criterion, a \nsite wins if it receives more support than any other site; according to the second and \nstronger criterion, a site wins if it receives more than twice the amount of support \nreceived by the second most popular site and at least 20% of the scout bees are engaged \nin dance activity. For the present parameter values (\u03bb = 0.8 and \u03c3 = 0.2), the best nest site \nemerged as the winner in nearly all cases, regardless of which criterion for a consensus \nwas employed: Under the first criterion, the best site was chosen every time; under the \nsecond, it was chosen 246 times, while no site met the winner criterion in the remaining \nfour cases. \nIn our next simulations, the interdependence between bees is reduced to a lower level \n(\u03bb = 0.5), while the other parameter values remain as before. Figure 2 shows a \nrepresentative simulation. While the best site (site 5) continues to receive the most \nsupport, there is also considerable dance activity for other sites, particularly the second \nbest (site 4), throughout all time periods. The consensus is less strong here. Again we \nrepeated the simulation for the same parameter values 250 times. Under the less \ndemanding criterion of consensus, the best nest site emerged as the winner 226 times and \nthe second best 22 times, with no winner in the remaining two cases; under the more \ndemanding criterion, the best site won 104 times, with no winner in all other cases. \nA further reduction in the interdependence between bees (to \u03bb = 0.2) weakens the \nemergence of a consensus even more significantly, as shown in Figure 3. In 250 \nrepetitions, this effect is particularly evident when we employ the more demanding one \nof our two criteria for consensus. While under the weaker criterion the best site (site 5) \nstill won 176 times (and the second best 63 times, the third best once, and no winner ten \ntimes), under the stronger criterion the best site won only 11 times and the second best \nonce, with no consensus in the other 238 cases. \n \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 12\nFigure 1: High reliability, high interdependence \n \n \nFigure 4: Low reliability, high interdependence \n \nFigure 2: High reliability, medium interdependence \n \n \nFigure 5: Low reliability, medium interdependence \n \nFigure 3: High reliability, low interdependence \n \n \nFigure 6: Low reliability, low interdependence \n \nFigures 1-6: Illustrative simulations to test hypothesis 1 \nHaving focused so far on the case in which bees are highly reliable in assessing nest sites, \nlet us now introduce more noise into the bees\u2019 individual assessment of sites (setting \n\u03c3=1). Strikingly, if interdependence between bees is high (i.e., \u03bb = 0.8), the overall \npattern remains broadly the same as in the best-case scenario reported earlier. Figure 4 \nshows a sample calculation. In 250 repetitions of the simulation, the best site (site 5) \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 13\nemerged as the consensus choice, even under the stronger criterion, 199 times and the \nsecond best site five times (site 4), with no consensus in the remaining 46 cases. Under \nthe weaker criterion, the best site won 237 times, the second best 12 times, with no \nwinner once.  \nFigures 5 and 6 show similar calculations for medium and low levels of interdependence \n(i.e., \u03bb = 0.5 and \u03bb = 0.2, respectively) and essentially confirm the earlier results for \nhigher individual reliability. In 250 repetitions of the simulations for a medium level of \ninterdependence, the best site emerged as the winner under the strong criterion 94 times \nand the second best once, with no consensus in all other cases. (Under the weaker \ncriterion, the effect is less pronounced: the best site won 220 times and the second best 28 \ntimes, with no winner twice.) When the level of interdependence was low, the best site \nwon only 7 times under the strong criterion, with no consensus in the other 243 cases. \n(Under the weaker criterion, the best site won 190 times, the second best 58 times, and in \nthe remaining two cases, no consensus emerged.) \nTable 1 summarizes the frequencies of various consensus choices in 250 repetitions of \nthe simulations. \nHigh individual reliability \n(\u03c3 = 0.2) \nLow individual reliability \n(\u03c3 = 1) \n \n \n Strong \nconsensus \ncriterion \nWeak \nconsensus \ncriterion \nStrong \nconsensus \ncriterion \nWeak \nconsensus \ncriterion \nHigh \ninterdependence \n(\u03bb = 0.8) \n1st best site \n2nd best site \n3rd best site \nNone \n246  (98.4%) \n0  (0%) \n0  (0%) \n4  (1.6%) \n250  (100%) \n0  (0%) \n0  (0%) \n0  (0%) \n199  (79.6%) \n5  (2%) \n0  (0%) \n46  (18.4%) \n237  (94.8%) \n12  (4.8%) \n0  (0%) \n1  (0.4%) \nMedium \ninterdependence \n(\u03bb = 0.5) \n \n1st best site \n2nd best site \n3rd best site \nNone \n104  (41.6%) \n0  (0%) \n0  (0%) \n146  (58.4%) \n226  (90.4%) \n22  (8.8%) \n0  (0%) \n2  (0.8%) \n94  (37.6%) \n1  (0.4%) \n0  (0%) \n155  (62%) \n220  (88%) \n28  (11.2%) \n0  (0%) \n2  (0.8%) \nLow \ninterdependence \n(\u03bb = 0.2) \n1st best site \n2nd best site \n3rd best site \nNone \n11  (4.4%) \n1 (0.4%) \n0  (0%) \n238  (95.2%) \n176  (70.4%) \n63  (25.2%) \n1  (0.4%) \n10  (4%) \n7  (2.8%) \n0  (0%) \n0  (0%) \n243  (97.2%) \n190  (76%) \n58  (23.2%) \n0  (0%) \n2  (0.8%) \nTable 1 \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 14\nResults on hypothesis 2 \nAs indicated, we isolated the effects of independence and interdependence by running \nsimulations for the special cases in which one or the other of these two characteristics \nwas absent. Figure 7 shows the case in which bees independently assess sites and they are \nalso relatively reliable (\u03c3 = 0.2), but there is no longer any interdependence between bees \nthrough communication (\u03bb = 0). No clear consensus winner emerges. Figure 8 shows an \nillustrative case in which interdependence between bees is high (\u03bb = 0.8), but they are no \nlonger independent (\u00b5 = 1); they all mimic the dances of other bees without \nindependently verifying the sites\u2019 quality. In this example, after relatively little initial \ndance activity, a sudden cascade of support for site 2 emerges (the second worst site), \nwhich is reinforced by the bees\u2019 mimicking of others\u2019 dances. Equally, a cascade of \nsupport for another site could have randomly emerged. \nFigure 7: Independence without interdependence \n \nFigure 8: Interdependence without independence \n \nFigures 7, 8: Illustrative simulations to test hypothesis 2 \nMore generally, we ran a large number of simulations with the level of interdependence \nranging from low (\u03bb = 0) to high (\u03bb = 1), keeping a high individual reliability and \nindependence of bees (\u03c3 = 0.2 and \u00b5 = 0). Figure 9 shows the proportion of wins for each \nof the five sites (in 250 simulations for each set of parameter values), for different levels \nof interdependence, where the winner is calculated using the more demanding criterion. \nThe results are qualitatively similar under the less demanding criterion. The best site (site \n5) consistently emerges as the winner only when the level of interdependence is above a \ncertain threshold. (Recall our earlier remarks, in the basic description of the computer \nsimulations, about the exceptional limiting case \u03bb=1.)  \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 15\nFigure 9: Interdependence ranging from low to high \n \nFigure 10: Independence ranging from low to high \n \nFigures 9, 10: Sequences of simulations to test hypothesis 2 \nSimilarly, we ran a large number of simulations with the level of independence ranging \nfrom low (\u00b5 = 1) to high (\u00b5 = 0), keeping a high interdependence of bees and a high \nreliability in the event they do verify a site\u2019s quality (\u03bb = 0.8 and \u03c3 = 0.2). Figure 10 \nshows the proportion of wins for each site (again in 250 simulations for each set of \nparameter values), for different levels of independence (displayed as 1-\u00b5). Again, we use \nthe more demanding criterion of consensus; the results are qualitatively similar under the \nless demanding criterion. The best site (site 5) consistently emerges as the winner only \nwhen the level of independence is not too low. \nDISCUSSION \nWe have developed an agent-based model of nest-site choice among honey bees. The \nmodel not only explicitly represents the behaviour of each individual bee as a simple \nstochastic process, but it also allows us to simulate the bees\u2019 decision-making behaviour \nunder a wide variety of empirically motivated as well as hypothetical assumptions. The \nmodel predicts that, consistently with empirical observations by Seeley and Buhrman \n(2001), the bees manage to reach a consensus on the best nest site for a large range of \nparameter conditions, under both more and less demanding criteria of \u201cconsensus\u201d. \nMoreover, the model shows that the remarkable reliability of the bees\u2019 decision-making \nprocess stems from the particular interplay of independence and interdependence \nbetween them. The bees are independent in assessing the quality of different nest sites on \ntheir own, but interdependent in giving more attention to nest sites that are more strongly \nadvertised by others.  \nWithout interdependence, the rapid convergence of the bees\u2019 dances to a consensus \nwould be undermined; there would not be a \u201csnowballing\u201d of attention on the best nest \nList, Elsholtz, Seeley: Independence and interdependence 16\nsite. Without independence, a consensus would still emerge, but it would no longer \nrobustly be on the best nest site; instead, many bees would end up dancing for nest sites \nthat accidentally receive some initial support through random fluctuations. It is only \nwhen independence and interdependence are combined in the right way that the bees \nachieve their remarkable collective reliability. \nTo illustrate the importance of both independence and interdependence in collective \ndecision making more generally, consider the human example of restaurant choice. If we \nwalk into a street with many restaurants, knowing nothing about their quality, we may \nwell pick whichever restaurant has the most diners, assuming that these people have \nchosen it for its quality. But if their reasoning was the same, we may all end up in the \nworst restaurant; if we don\u2019t, this is entirely accidental. This phenomenon is called an \ninformational cascade (Bikhchandani et al. 1992). It is only if enough people choose a \nrestaurant based on independently gathered information that such cascades can be \navoided. Interdependence without independence can lead everyone to a bad decision. (Of \ncourse, in the restaurant case, additional complexities arise because differences in \nindividual choices are not only due to different information but also due to different \npreferences; in the case of the bees, we have made the simplifying assumption that \ndifferences in individual choices are solely due to informational differences, \npresupposing that there is an objective quality standard for nest sites.)  \nLikewise, independence without interdependence can be suboptimal too. Imagine a world \nwithout any restaurant reviews or recommendations, where people only ever gather \ninformation about restaurants by wandering around the streets alone and checking out the \nrestaurants they see. It can easily happen, then, that an outstanding but badly located \nrestaurant may fail to get many customers because too few people stumble across it. \nThe bees\u2019 ingenuity lies in their avoidance of both of these problems. Nature has given \nthem the right mix of independence and interdependence. \nREFERENCES \nAusten-Smith, D., Banks, J. S. (1996) Information aggregation, rationality, and the \nCondorcet Jury Theorem.
