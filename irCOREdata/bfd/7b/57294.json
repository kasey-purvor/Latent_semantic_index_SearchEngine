AFTA data in samples of Precambrian basement and 17 \nPermian-Cretaceous sediments from onshore and onshore reveal multiple phases of post-18 \nCaledonian cooling, viz: Triassic (beginning 245-225 Ma), Cretaceous (140-130 Ma; 110-90 19 \nMa) and Cenozoic (65-60 Ma; 40-25 Ma; 15-10 Ma), all of which are interpreted at least in 20 \npart as recording exhumation. Basement and sedimentary cover rocks display similar thermal 21 \nhistories, emphasising the regional nature of these episodes and implying that sedimentary 22 \noutliers represent the remnants of previously more extensive sequences.  Significant 23 \nthicknesses of Jurassic rocks may once have covered northwest Scotland. Palaeocene 24 \npalaeothermal effects are most pronounced in the vicinity of igneous centres, probably 25 \nreflecting combined effects of heating by elevated heat flow, deeper burial and hydrothermal 26 \nactivity. Most of the region underwent km-scale Neogene exhumation. Contrary to the 27 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  2 \ncommon assumption of monotonic cooling and denudation histories, integration of geological 28 \nevidence with AFTA data defines an episodic thermal history involving repeated cycles of 29 \nburial and exhumation. We suggest that onshore passive margins and continental interiors 30 \nmay also best be characterised by similar histories. 31 \n 32 \n 33 \n 34 \n 35 \nAbstract 36 \nThe origin and development of the high topography bordering the Atlantic margin of NW 37 \nEurope has long been the subject of debate (Geike, 1901; George, 1966; Dor\u00e9 et al., 2002). 38 \nThe mountains of Scotland and western Scandinavia are characterized by rugged topography 39 \nand elevations that exceed 1.3 km and 2.4 km respectively and largely comprise rocks that 40 \nwere formed and\/or deformed during the Caledonian Orogeny. Numerous lines of evidence 41 \nindicate that the present-day topography of both regions was initiated by tectonic uplift that 42 \nbegan during the Cenozoic or late Mesozoic and which also affected peripheral sedimentary 43 \nbasins (Dor\u00e9 et al., 2002). These include; the transition from deposition of shallow-marine 44 \ncarbonates in the late Cretaceous to rejuvenated clastic sedimentation in the early Palaeogene 45 \n(Dor\u00e9 et al., 2002)); the easterly tilt of Britain (Brodie & White, 1994); identification of 46 \nPalaeocene, Eocene and Pliocene-Pleistocene prograding and locally heavily incised shelf-47 \nslope wedges of clastic sediments offshore Scotland and Norway (Stoker et al., 1993, 2010; 48 \nUnderhill, 2001); apatite fission track, vitrinite reflectance and sonic velocity data which 49 \nrecord deeper burial of Cenozoic-Mesozoic sediments and Palaeozoic and older basement 50 \nrocks along the Atlantic margin prior to their uplift and erosion (Japsen et al., 2007; Hillis et 51 \nal., 2008); and, geomorphological evidence for elevation of low-relief erosion surfaces and 52 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  3 \nlandscape elements formed at or near sea level during the Mesozoic and Palaeogene and 53 \nsubsequently uplifted (Japsen et al., 2002).  54 \n 55 \nDespite this evidence for tectonically driven uplift of the Atlantic margin during the late 56 \nMesozoic and Cenozoic, it has been recently proposed  (Nielsen et al., 2009) that the present-57 \nday topography of western Scandinavia and the Scottish Highlands represents remnant 58 \ntopography from the Caledonian Orogeny that survived post-orogenic extensional collapse 59 \nand erosion. Nielsen et al. (2009) suggest that many of the observations listed above that have 60 \nbeen used to argue for Cenozoic tectonic uplift can instead be interpreted in terms of 61 \nprotracted exhumation maintained by climatically-controlled erosion rates. This hypothesis 62 \nimplies that the Scottish Highlands and western Scandinavia have been positive topographic 63 \nfeatures for the past ~400 million years, experiencing no significant burial and receiving little 64 \nor no Upper Palaeozoic-Cenozoic sediments (cf. Macdonald et al., 2007).  65 \n 66 \nRecent apatite fission track and (U-Th)\/He data from basement samples in the Scottish 67 \nHighlands have been interpreted in terms of thermal histories dominated by continuous, 68 \nmonotonic cooling and exhumation over the past ~400 Myr (Persano et al., 2007) and thus 69 \nsupport the idea of continuous, post-Caledonian emergence (cf. Watson, 1985). Such 70 \nmonotonic cooling of basement rocks is inconsistent with the local geological record 71 \nhowever, because outliers of Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian-Triassic, Jurassic and 72 \nCretaceous sediments overlying Neoproterozoic basement (e.g. Moine Supergroup, 73 \nTorridonian) are found along the coast of northwest Scotland (Fig. 1).  In addition,  thick 74 \nsequences of mainly Triassic-Jurassic age sediments are preserved in offshore basins of the 75 \nMalin-Hebrides sea area (Fyfe et al., 1993), whilst the overstep of Old Red Sandstone onto 76 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  4 \nlate Caledonian granites indicates that Caledonian topography had largely been worn down 77 \nby rapid uplift and erosion during the early Devonian (Hall, 1991).   78 \n 79 \nConversely, other workers have claimed that Scotland has experienced post-Caledonian 80 \ntectonically-driven uplift that was dominantly early Palaeogene in age and driven by 81 \nprocesses associated with the Iceland mantle plume, such as igneous underplating or 82 \nconvectively-supported dynamic uplift (White & Lovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002; Shaw 83 \nChampion et al., 2008). However, recent fission-track studies from the southern British Isles 84 \nhave revealed a more complex Mesozoic-Cenozoic uplift history, with major phases of km-85 \nscale uplift and exhumation occurring during the early Cretaceous and Neogene in addition to 86 \nthe early Palaeogene (Holford et al., 2005; Hillis et al., 2008; Holford et al., 2009a, b, c).  87 \n 88 \nThe aim of this study is to test these different models for the post-Caledonian tectonic 89 \nevolution of northwest Scotland using a new apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) database 90 \ncomprising onshore and offshore samples from basement (i.e. Lower Palaeozoic and older) 91 \nand from the Permian-Cretaceous sediments deposited in overlying sedimentary basins. The 92 \noffshore database includes samples collected over a range of depths from exploration wells 93 \nlocated in the Sea of the Hebrides (134\/5-1) and West Orkney (202\/19-1) basins that provide 94 \ndirect constraints on palaeogeothermal gradients and allow estimates of amounts of missing 95 \nsection removed during exhumation. Thermal history solutions extracted from our data show 96 \nconsistency between samples from basement and cover sequences and show that the 97 \nMesozoic sediments deposited around northwest Scotland have been heated to temperatures 98 \nexceeding 100\u00b0C during burial by additional sedimentary sequences. The preserved 99 \nsediments are thus interpreted as remnants of deposits that were originally far more extensive, 100 \nraising the possibility that the Highlands were buried beneath a Mesozoic sedimentary cover. 101 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  5 \nThe additional sedimentary sequences were removed during a series of Cretaceous-Cenozoic 102 \nexhumation episodes, whose timing is constrained by both AFTA data and unconformities 103 \nthat separate the sedimentary units. Our results indicate that interpretations involving 104 \ncontinual post-Caledonian emergence cannot be sustained, and that the post-400 Ma history 105 \nof northwest Scotland has been characterised by repeated cycles of sedimentation and 106 \nexhumation, suggesting that post-Caledonian events are largely responsible for the 107 \nphysiography of northwest Scotland.   108 \n 109 \nPost-Caledonian geological history of northwest Scotland 110 \nThe Caledonian orogeny in northwest Scotland culminated during the Lower Devonian (Fyfe 111 \net al., 1993). The onset of extensional tectonics in the Middle Devonian facilitated the 112 \ncollapse of the Caledonian mountain belt (Stoker et al., 1993). Thick sequences of Old Red 113 \nSandstone (ORS) continental sediments and lavas occur within the Midland Valley, southeast 114 \nof the Highland Boundary Fault (Fyfe et al., 1993) and large areas of Devonian sedimentary 115 \nrocks in northeast Scotland are remnants of the originally more extensive Orcadian Basin 116 \n(Hillier and Marshall, 1992) (Fig. 1). Limited ORS siliciclastic and volcanic outcrops of 117 \nLower Devonian age around Oban and in the Firth of Lorne are interpreted to be the 118 \npreserved remnants of a formerly more extensive ORS cover (Fyfe et al., 1993). 119 \nCarboniferous rocks are of limited exposure in the Scottish Highlands with the exception of 120 \n~100 m of Carboniferous sandstone preserved on Morvern (Fyfe et al., 1993), although 121 \nconsiderably thicker sequences (up to 3 km) of marine and nonmarine Carboniferous 122 \nsediments are preserved within the Midland Valley Basin (Underhill et al., 2008).  123 \n 124 \nPermian-Triassic continental redbeds are widely distributed in the basins offshore northwest 125 \nScotland (Fig. 1), reaching thicknesses of ~3 km in the North Minch Basin (Fyfe et al., 1993). 126 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  6 \nUpper Triassic sediments are exposed on Skye, Ardnamurchan, Mull, Morvern, Applecross, 127 \nGruinard Bay and on northeast Lewis where ~1.2 km of Permian-Triassic sandstones and 128 \nconglomerates rest with unconformable or faulted contact against Lewisian gneisses (Fyfe et 129 \nal., 1993). These basins also contain thick sequences of marine and nonmarine Jurassic 130 \ndeposits, and there are onshore outcrops along the northwestern coast of Scotland and on 131 \nSkye and Raasay where the Jurassic succession reaches 450 m (Fyfe et al., 1993). Based on 132 \ndetailed subsidence analyses of preserved Triassic-Jurassic rocks in the Inner Hebrides, 133 \nMorton (1987) proposed that the initial phase of crustal stretching responsible for the 134 \nHebridean basin system commenced during the late Triassic (~210 Ma). 135 \n 136 \nCretaceous rocks are less widely distributed (Fig. 1), but this is considered to be due 137 \nCenozoic uplift and erosion rather than non-deposition (Hallam, 1983). Upper Cretaceous 138 \nsediments are preserved on Morvern, including glauconitic and pure silica sandstones 139 \noverlain by silicified Chalk (Fyfe et al., 1993). The Cretaceous rocks on Morvern rest 140 \nunconformably on Triassic-Jurassic strata, implying an intervening period of erosion, 141 \nprobably during the early Cretaceous (Hallam, 1983). There are minor outcrops of Upper 142 \nCretaceous strata on Skye, Mull, Eigg and Arran but no rocks of this age have been proven 143 \nimmediately offshore (Fyfe et al., 1993).   144 \n 145 \nWidespread volcanicity accompanied continental breakup between Greenland and northwest 146 \nEurope in the late Palaeocene-early Eocene along the North Atlantic margins (Emeleus and 147 \nBell, 2005). Most volcanicity in the British Isles was concentrated in northwest Scotland, 148 \nwith major igneous centres at Mull, Ardnamurchan, Rum and Skye (Emeleus and Bell, 2005). 149 \nThis igneous activity has been attributed to the proto-Iceland mantle plume, and petrological 150 \ndata suggest that a significant proportion (up to 70%) of the melt generated around the British 151 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  7 \nIsles was trapped at depth, leading to underplating of the lower crust, which in turn would 152 \nhave resulted in surface uplift (Jones et al., 2002). However, the depth to the seismic 153 \nreflection Moho beneath northwest Scotland is low compared to southeast Scotland (varying 154 \nfrom 25 to 29 km beneath basins and basement) (Chadwick and Pharaoh, 1998) and is 155 \ninconsistent with the crust having been significantly thickened by igneous material. 156 \n 157 \nClimatic deterioration during the Quaternary profoundly affected the landscape of the 158 \nScottish Highlands, with decreasing temperatures permitting the growth of glaciers on 159 \nuplifted terrain which in turn promoted widespread erosion and deposition of glacial 160 \nglaciomarine sediments offshore northwest Scotland (Stoker et al., 1993). 161 \n 162 \nAFTA methodology and database 163 \nThe methodological and analytical aspects of AFTA are well established (e.g. Green et al., 164 \n2002). AFTA utilizes the radiation damage trails (fission tracks) created by spontaneous 165 \nfission of 238U within the crystal lattice of apatite, which is a common detrital mineral in most 166 \nsandstone and occurs as an accessory phase in plutonic and high grade metamorphic rocks. 167 \nBy counting the number tracks in a polished and etched grain surface and measuring the 168 \nuranium content, a fission track age can be calculated, which in the absence of other factors 169 \nwould provide a direct measure of the time over which tracks have accumulated. Fission 170 \ntrack lengths form within a narrow range (~16 \u03bcm), but are progressively shortened as 171 \nradiation damage is repaired at a rate that increases with temperature (annealing). Shortening 172 \nleads to a reduction in the number of tracks that can intersect a polished surface, and above 173 \n110\u00b0C all damage is repaired and no tracks are preserved. A measured fission track age thus 174 \nrepresents a balance between production of tracks and loss by annealing, and must be 175 \nassessed in tandem with track length data. 176 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  8 \nWe present AFTA data from 78 samples collected from onshore and offshore northwest 177 \nScotland (Fig. 1, Table 1). Our dataset includes 42 samples from onshore outcrops, 21 178 \nsamples from British Geological Survey (BGS) offshore shallow boreholes and drill cores, 179 \nand 15 samples from two wells (202\/19-1 in the West Orkney Basin (WOB) and 134\/5-1 in 180 \nthe Sea of Hebrides Basin (SOHB)). The samples cover a broad range of stratigraphic levels, 181 \nfrom Proterozoic (Torridonian and Moine) and Archean (Lewisian) basement to Phanerozoic 182 \nsedimentary cover rocks of Permian, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous age. Data quality is 183 \ngenerally excellent, with the majority of samples yielding 20 or more single grain ages and 184 \nmany samples yielding 100 track lengths (Table 1). 185 \n  186 \nThe majority of measured fission track ages are younger than the respective stratigraphic ages 187 \n(Table 1). Overall there is a consistent trend between fission track age and mean track length, 188 \nwith most fission track ages in the range of 150-300 Ma regardless of the depositional or 189 \nmetamorphic age of the host rock, and mean track lengths (MTLs) in the range 11-13 \u00b5m 190 \n(Fig. 2). Samples from Skye yield much younger fission track ages between 50 and 70 Ma, 191 \nwith mean track lengths around ~13-14 \u00b5m.  The main trend in Fig. 2 is very different from 192 \nthe simple \u201cboomerang trend\u201d shown by samples that have undergone a single heating event 193 \nin which different samples have undergone varying degrees of resetting (Green, 1986), and 194 \nsuggests that the region has undergone a relatively complex history involving a series of 195 \nresetting events.    196 \n 197 \nWith the exception of one sample (GC503-151), the fission track ages of all samples from 198 \nnorthwest Scotland are younger than 400 Ma and the overwhelming majority are younger 199 \nthan 300 Ma i.e. at least 100 Myr younger than the latest stages of Caledonian Orogeny. This 200 \nimmediately indicates that almost all basement and early Palaeozoic samples reached 201 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  9 \npalaeotemperatures sufficient to produce severe age reduction (i.e. ~100\u00b0C or above) during 202 \npost-Caledonian events. Moreover, Proterozoic and Achaean basement samples tend to yield 203 \nsimilar fission track ages and length distributions to nearby Phanerozoic cover samples 204 \n(Table 1 and Fig. 2), suggesting that basement and cover sequences in northwest Scotland 205 \nhave undergone similar thermal histories. 206 \n 207 \nThermal history interpretation of AFTA data 208 \nBasic principles 209 \nExtraction of thermal history information from AFTA data begins with construction of a 210 \nDefault Thermal History (DTH), derived from the burial history defined by the preserved 211 \nsedimentary section and the present-day thermal gradient.  For a sedimentary rock, this is the 212 \nhistory which would apply if the sample has never been any hotter than the present-day 213 \ntemperature at any time since deposition. For basement samples, a similar approach can be 214 \nadopted using the age of the oldest overlying sedimentary units, which in this study we have 215 \nassumed to be Devonian if no sedimentary units are present.  If the DTH can explain the 216 \nAFTA data, then it is not possible to extract further thermal history information.  If the AFTA 217 \ndata show a greater degree of annealing (i.e. fission track age and\/or track length reduction) 218 \nthan expected from the DTH, then the sample must have been hotter in the past and 219 \ninformation on the magnitude and timing of heating and cooling events can be extracted from 220 \nthe data.  All samples analysed in this study show a greater degree of annealing (i.e. fission 221 \ntrack age and\/or length reduction) than that expected from the DTH , and have therefore been 222 \nmuch hotter in the past. 223 \n 224 \nTo extract thermal history information from AFTA data, we use a kinetic model that makes 225 \nfull quantitative allowance for the effects of Cl content on fission-track annealing rates 226 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  10 \n(Green et al., 2002). Because maximum palaeotemperatures are the key factor that dominates 227 \nAFTA data, this technique reveals little information on the thermal history prior to the onset 228 \nof cooling. Therefore, we do not attempt to constrain the entire thermal history of each 229 \nsample but focus on the key aspects of the thermal history that control the fission track age 230 \nand length distribution i.e. the maximum palaeotemperature of each sample, and the time at 231 \nwhich cooling from that palaeotemperature began. 232 \n 233 \nBy modelling expected AFTA parameters resulting from a range of possible thermal 234 \nhistories, we use maximum likelihood theory similar to that described by Gallagher (1995) to 235 \ndefine the range of values of maximum palaeotemperature and the onset of cooling giving 236 \npredictions which match the measured data within 95% confidence limits. Palaeotemperature 237 \nestimates derived using this approach usually have an absolute uncertainty of better than 238 \n\u00b110\u00b0C. Many of the samples analysed in this study require at least two episodes of heating 239 \nand cooling to explain all facets of the data. AFTA can provide constraints on two episodes 240 \nprovided the magnitude and timing of the palaeothermal maximum and the subsequent 241 \n(lower) peak palaeotemperature are sufficiently separated. In some cases (e.g. Turner et al., 242 \n2008) it is possible to resolve three discrete episodes in data from a single sample. This is 243 \nmost likely when the first episode involves a maximum palaeotemperature sufficient to 244 \ntotally anneal all tracks (typically >110\u00b0C), followed by a subsequent peak around 90- 100\u00b0C 245 \nwhich leads to shortening of tracks formed after the initial cooling to a mean length of ~10 246 \n\u03bcm. Finally, cooling to a low temperature is followed by reheating to ~70\u00b0C, sufficient to 247 \nreduce track lengths formed after the second episode to ~12-13 \u03bcm.  248 \n 249 \nTable 2 summarises estimates of peak palaeotemperatures reached by each sample and the 250 \ntime at which cooling from these palaeotemperatures began.  251 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  11 \nWest Orkney Basin 252 \nOf six Permian-Lower Jurassic samples from offshore shallow boreholes in the WOB, most 253 \nrequire two discrete episodes of heating and cooling (Table 2); an early episode involving 254 \ncooling from palaeotemperatures typically >90\u00b0C beginning at some time during the mid-255 \nJurassic to late Cretaceous (180 to 85 Ma based on combined results from all samples; Fig. 256 \n3). These palaeotemperatures imply significant depths of burial for any reasonable 257 \npalaeogeothermal gradient. This was followed by reheating and a second cooling episode 258 \n(from palaeotemperatures typically between 50- 70\u00b0C; Table 2) that commenced during the 259 \nmid-late Cenozoic (between 30 and 15 Ma; Fig. 3). These results are interpreted in terms of 260 \nburial of the preserved WOB succession by late Triassic-Jurassic sediments that were 261 \nremoved by exhumation that occurred in two stages (mid-Jurassic to late Cretaceous, and 262 \nmid-late Cenozoic) 263 \n 264 \nExploration well 202\/19-1 265 \nWOB well 202\/19-1 was drilled in the hangingwall of the Solan Bank High Fault (Evans, 266 \n1997) and encountered ~3 km of Upper Permian-Lower Triassic sediments beneath a thin 267 \nveneer of Quaternary deposits (Stoker et al, 1993). AFTA results indicate that all nine 268 \nsamples reached temperatures of ~100\u00b0C or above prior to cooling that began during the late 269 \nJurassic to late Cretaceous (Table 2), similar to results from WOB boreholes. The consistent 270 \ntiming of cooling based on overlap for all samples is 110 to 90 Ma (Fig. 3). A later episode of 271 \ncooling beginning during the late Cretaceous-Cenozoic is also required for most samples, 272 \nwith the consistent overlap suggesting an onset beginning during the mid-late Cenozoic (55 273 \nto 10 Ma). 274 \n 275 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  12 \nThe variation of palaeotemperature with depth for the two separate episodes (Fig. 4b) 276 \nsuggests that both can be satisfied by linear palaeotemperature profiles, with gradients close 277 \nto the present-day gradient of ~25.3\u00b0C km-1. This indicates that these palaeotemperatures 278 \nrecord heating caused by deeper burial and subsequent cooling caused by exhumation (cf. 279 \nGreen et al., 2002). Assuming a palaeosurface temperature of 5\u00b0C and palaeogeothermal 280 \ngradients equivalent to the present-day gradient, early Cretaceous palaeotemperatures are 281 \nconsistent with deeper burial by 3.3-3.9 km of additional Triassic-Lower Cretaceous section, 282 \nwhilst the mid-late Cenozoic palaeotemperatures are consistent with an additional 1.2-1.7 km 283 \nof section (Fig. 4c).  Higher surface temperatures would require correspondingly lower 284 \namounts of additional section, while higher palaeogeothermal gradients (within the ranges 285 \nallowed by the constraints on each episode) would require lower amounts of additional 286 \nsection. 287 \n 288 \nEvans (1997) estimated the amount of deeper burial of the Permian-Triassic section at 289 \n202\/19-1 by comparing Triassic shale sonic velocities against published velocity-depth 290 \nrelationships for normally compacted shales. By comparison with the burial curves of Marie 291 \n(1975) and Magara (1976), Evans (1997) estimated gross exhumation of the Permian-Triassic 292 \nsection at 1.85 km. These velocity-depth relationships overestimate the increase of velocity 293 \nwith depth in comparison to more recent trends for Triassic shales from the British Isles (e.g. 294 \nJapsen 2000). The value reported by Evans (1997) may thus underestimate the amount of 295 \ngross exhumation by several hundred metres. The amount of exhumation indicated by sonic 296 \ndata is lower than that indicated by early Cretaceous AFTA palaeotemperatures assuming a 297 \ngeothermal gradient of 25.3\u00b0C km-1 (i.e. 3.3-3.9 km) but is reasonably close to the maximum 298 \nlikelihood value of additional section (2.31 km) (Fig. 4c).  The slightly lower values of 299 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  13 \nadditional section indicated by the sonic velocity data could also indicate elevated basal heat 300 \nflow during the early Cretaceous. 301 \n 302 \nBased on AFTA and sonic data from 202\/19-1 and AFTA data from shallow boreholes we 303 \nsuggest that up to 2-3 km of Upper Triassic-Lower Cretaceous sediments were deposited in 304 \nparts of the WOB prior to early Cretaceous (110-90 Ma) exhumation. Although some 305 \nsamples are from footwall blocks, many others (including those from 202\/19-1) are from 306 \nhangingwalls which implies a regional cause for exhumation as opposed to localized 307 \nexhumation of footwalls during Cretaceous normal faulting and extension. 308 \n 309 \nHebridean region 310 \nWe analysed 22 samples from the North Minch Basin (NMB), Outer Hebrides and outcrops 311 \nalong the northwest coast of Scotland. Most require two palaeothermal episodes, and thermal 312 \nhistory solutions for Permian and younger samples are generally similar to those resolved for 313 \nbasement samples (Table 2). When combined, results from this region reveal up to four 314 \nseparate cooling episodes during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic (Fig. 3). 315 \n 316 \nSeveral of the Archean and Proterozoic samples, notably those in the footwalls of the NMB 317 \nfrom Lewis and Harris and the northwest coast of Scotland, require Permian-Triassic cooling 318 \nfrom temperatures generally >100\u00b0C (Table 2). An onset of cooling beginning between 225 319 \nand 190 Ma satisfies all samples that show evidence for this episode (Fig. 3). 320 \n 321 \nMost samples from both basement and cover rocks in the Hebridean region show evidence 322 \nfor cooling from palaeotemperatures of up to ~105\u00b0C during the Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous 323 \n(Table 2). Precise constraints on the timing of this episode are often broad in individual 324 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  14 \nsamples suggesting that Jurassic-mid Cretaceous cooling could result from several unresolved 325 \nevents, but Permian-Lower Cretaceous sedimentary samples from shallow boreholes in the 326 \nHebrides Shelf (GC523-47 to 52) define consistent evidence for cooling from ~90-95\u00b0C 327 \nbeginning during the early Cretaceous (140 to 130 Ma) (Fig. 3). 328 \n 329 \nLikewise, most samples from the Hebridean region reveal evidence for elevated 330 \npalaeotemperatures during the late Cretaceous-Cenozoic. Timing constraints are quite broad 331 \nfor some samples, which is again suggestive of several distinct phases of cooling that are 332 \nclosely spaced in temperature and time. It is possible to identify discrete late Cretaceous-mid 333 \nCenozoic and late Cenozoic cooling episodes in data from Permian-Triassic sample GC523-334 \n11 from NMB borehole 71\/11. AFTA suggests that this sample cooled from 95-100\u00b0C 335 \nbetween 75 and 30 Ma, with further cooling from 55-80\u00b0C between 15 Ma and the present-336 \nday. In Table 2 we have  assigned late Cretaceous-Cenozoic cooling observed in individual 337 \nepisodes to discrete late Cretaceous-mid Cenozoic (75 to 40 Ma) and late Cenozoic (15 to 0 338 \nMa) episodes, with the former more prevalent in basement samples on the flanks of the NMB 339 \n(e.g. GC503-184) and the latter clearly resolved in samples from the Hebrides Shelf (e.g. 340 \nGC523-49, 56). However, we acknowledge that other interpretations of these results are 341 \npossible given the broad timing constraints for some samples. 342 \n 343 \nExploration well 134\/5-1 344 \nWe analysed eight AFTA samples from exploration well 134\/5-1, located in the SOHB ~50 345 \nkm southwest of Skye (Fig. 1). The well intersected ~2340 m of Upper Triassic-Lower 346 \nJurassic section intruded by numerous Palaeocene minor sills and dykes (i.e. <2 m thick). We 347 \nalso analysed 29 vitrinite reflectance (VR) samples (predominantly from the Jurassic section), 348 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  15 \nusing the kinetic model of Burnham and Sweeney (1989) to convert observed Romax values 349 \nto palaeotemperatures (using an assumed heating rate of 1\u00b0C Ma-1). 350 \n 351 \nBHT data indicate a present-day geothermal gradient of 47.5\u00b0C km-1, but the DTH calculated 352 \non this basis for sample GC369-6 predicts total annealing, whereas this sample contains 353 \ntracks and gives a finite (though very young) fission track age (Fig. 5a). In samples GC369-3 354 \nand 4 a similar comment applies to apatites containing <0.2 wt% Cl. In addition, GC369-4 355 \nand 5 show less length reduction than expected from the DTH. These aspects of the AFTA 356 \ndata suggest that present-day temperatures based on a gradient of 47.5\u00b0C km-1 are too high, 357 \nand are more consistent with a gradient of \u226443\u00b0C km-1. We have used this upper limit as the 358 \nbasis for construction of the DTH used to extract thermal histories from AFTA, and on this 359 \nbasis six samples show clear evidence of having been hotter in the past (Table 2).  360 \n 361 \nCombining timing constraints derived from AFTA samples with maximum 362 \npalaeotemperatures derived from VR data (Fig. 5b), indicates that two distinct Cenozoic 363 \ncooling episodes have affected the preserved section (Table 2). VR-derived 364 \npalaeotemperatures show fluctuations over narrow depth intervals around intrusions 365 \nsuperimposed on a \u201cbackground\u201d linear profile (Fig. 5b). The rapid fluctuations clearly 366 \nreflect contact heating around the igneous intrusions.  AFTA data in GC369-2 is also 367 \ninterpreted to reflect contact heating, and a similar conclusion applies to the 368 \npalaeotemperature constraint from GC369-1, as it plots above the main background trend 369 \ndefined by VR and other AFTA samples (Fig. 5b). AFTA data from the Triassic section 370 \n(>1.75 km depth) define mid-Cenozoic cooling that began between 45 and 20 Ma (Table 2). 371 \nLower limits to the maximum palaeotemperature in this episode are consistent with the linear 372 \nbackground trend defined by the VR data through this section and shallower units (Fig. 5b). 373 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  16 \nSimilarly, the range of palaeotemperatures indicated by AFTA data in Jurassic sample 374 \nGC523-58 is also consistent with this trend and palaeotemperatures indicated by VR data at 375 \nsimilar depths.  Therefore we interpret the \u201cbackground\u201d linear increase of palaeotemperature 376 \nwith depth indicated by the shallower and deeper VR data as defining a mid-Cenozoic 377 \npalaeothermal peak (Fig. 3) Palaeotemperatures characterising this episode are consistent 378 \nwith a range of palaeogeothermal gradients from ~30-50 \u00b0C km-1 (Fig. 5c). If the mid-379 \nCenozoic palaeogeothermal gradient was similar to the revised present-day gradient (43\u00b0C 380 \nkm-1), these data imply deeper burial by between 0.64 to 0.91 km of additional post-Lower 381 \nJurassic section, removed during mid-Cenozoic (45-20 Ma) exhumation (Fig. 5c). These 382 \nresults confirm km-scale deeper burial of preserved Jurassic and Triassic strata, but also 383 \nsuggest that early Palaeocene cooling in some parts of this region, often attributed solely to 384 \nexhumation, is dominantly a consequence of igneous activity. 385 \n  386 \nSkye, Mull and Morvern 387 \nWe analysed 31 onshore and two offshore samples collected on and around Skye, Mull and 388 \nthe Morvern peninsula, and one additional sample collected from central Scotland. Samples 389 \nencompass a broad range of ages, from Mesoproterozoic to Upper Cretaceous (Fig. 3). 390 \nThermal history interpretation indicates that most samples around Skye, irrespective of their 391 \nstratigraphic age (e.g. Moine sample GC523-6, near Glenancross and Jurassic sample 392 \nGC523-10, from BH71\/10) were totally annealed during early Palaeogene heating, reaching 393 \ntemperatures >110\u00b0C before cooling which began between 65 and 60 Ma (Fig. 3). Samples 394 \nthat were totally annealed during the early Palaeogene enable resolution of a late Cenozoic 395 \ncooling episode, also observed in samples from Applecross that were not totally annealed in 396 \nthe Palaeocene event. Combining timing constraints for all samples suggests that cooling 397 \nbegan between 20 and 10 Ma (Fig. 3). Results from around Mull are generally consistent with 398 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  17 \nthose from Skye, although the onset of Cenozoic cooling in Devonian sample GC523-77 399 \nfrom Iona and Moine sample GC523-78 from near Bunessan is slightly later (60 to 20 Ma) 400 \n(Fig. 3). This could represent the failure to resolve two distinct Cenozoic cooling episodes.  401 \n 402 \nAFTA results from Morvern are reported in more detail in a subsequent section of this paper, 403 \nbut generally define distinct cooling episodes beginning during the early-mid Triassic (245 to 404 \n225 Ma), early-mid Cenozoic (65 to 30 Ma) and late Cenozoic (20 to 10 Ma) (Table 2). 405 \n 406 \nIntegrating AFTA results with regional geological evidence 407 \nTriassic-early Jurassic cooling episodes (245-225 and 225-190 Ma) 408 \nPre-Mesozoic samples across northwest Scotland provide evidence for two phases of cooling 409 \nbeginning during the Triassic-Jurassic. Lewisian basement samples from the Outer Hebrides 410 \n(GC523-95, 97, 98) and Hebrides Shelf (GC523-55) reveal Triassic-early Jurassic cooling 411 \nfrom >105\u00b0C that began between 225 and 190 Ma (Figs. 3, 6, 7a). There is no strong 412 \nstratigraphic evidence for major Triassic-early Jurassic erosion in the Hebridean basins (Fyfe 413 \net al., 1993). Morton (1987) suggested that the first phase of crustal stretching responsible for 414 \nthe Hebridean basin system began ~210 Ma. Because these samples are located in the 415 \nfootwalls of major Triassic-Jurassic normal faults (e.g. the Minch Fault; Roberts & 416 \nHoldsworth, 1999) we interpret this cooling as due to localized exhumation driven by 417 \nfootwall uplift. Similar footwall uplift has been identified in the North Sea from seismic data 418 \n(Roberts & Yielding, 1991), although any palaeothermal effects there have been overprinted 419 \nby Jurassic burial, reflecting the greater degree of extension and post-rift subsidence. 420 \n 421 \nMesoproterozoic (Moine), Silurian (Strontian Granite) and Devonian sedimentary AFTA 422 \nsamples from around Skye, Mull and Morvern reveal evidence for early Triassic cooling that 423 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  18 \nbegan between 245 and 225 Ma (Figs. 3, 6, 7a). Sample RD17-41 also shows that cooling at 424 \nthis time also occurred in central Scotland, emphasising the regional extent of this episode 425 \n(Fig. 7a). Whilst the timing of cooling is similar to that observed in the footwall of the Minch 426 \nFault (e.g. samples GC523-95, 97, 98), the consistency of data and interpretations over much 427 \nof the study area (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3) suggests a more regional event. One possible 428 \nexplanation for this early Triassic cooling is that it represents the final stage of post-429 \nCaledonian unroofing that brought Precambrian and Lower Palaeozoic basement rocks to the 430 \nsurface prior to their reburial beneath Mesozoic sediments.  431 \n 432 \nEarly-mid Cretaceous cooling episodes (140-130 and 110-90 Ma) 433 \nA key finding of this study is that Permian-Lower Cretaceous sediments now exposed at or 434 \nnear surface levels around northwest Scotland have been heated to temperatures higher than 435 \n90-100\u00b0C which we interpret as reflecting regional Triassic-Jurassic burial. Particularly in 436 \nnorthern and central parts of the study area (e.g. the WOB), these maximum post-depositional 437 \ntemperatures were attained during the early to mid-Cretaceous (Figs. 3, 7b, c).  438 \n 439 \nOur results indicate two separate phases of early Cretaceous cooling, with the more recent 440 \nevent apparently restricted to the WOB (including well 202\/19-1) while the earlier event 441 \naffected a wider region, across the Hebrides and eastwards into central Scotland (Fig. 7b). 442 \nOur preferred interpretation is that these are distinct episodes based on consistencies in the 443 \ndata that characterise the different events (Tables 1  and 2). Early Cretaceous cooling is less 444 \nwell defined around Skye, Mull and Morvern (Fig. 7b), which we attribute to overprinting by 445 \nearly Palaeogene heating related to igneous activity. Results from well 202\/19-1 suggests that 446 \nheating to the early to mid-Cretaceous palaeotemperatures was dominantly due to deeper 447 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  19 \nburial, with subsequent cooling to exhumation, and this conclusion can be extended to 448 \ncooling at this time recorded in WOB shallow borehole samples (Table 2; Fig. 3). 449 \n 450 \nCretaceous rocks are largely absent around northwest Scotland, but where preserved their 451 \nstratigraphic relations often provide evidence for early-mid Cretaceous exhumation and 452 \ndeformation. Cenomanian sandstones at Morvern rest unconformably on Lower Jurassic and 453 \nolder rocks, indicating intervening uplift and erosion (Fyfe et al, 1993). In north Skye, NE-454 \ntrending anticlines within Jurassic strata are not observed in the thin Upper Cretaceous 455 \nsequences that underlie Paleocene lavas (England, 1994). The axes of these folds trend 456 \nparallel to the major basin-bounding faults (e.g. the Camasunary-Skerryvore Fault), and 457 \nindicate early Cretaceous deformation in the Hebridean region (Bell & Williamson, 2002). 458 \nFurther south, AFTA data from wells in the Irish Sea basin system and from samples onshore 459 \nIreland record widespread early Cretaceous (~120-115 Ma) exhumation (Holford et al., 460 \n2009a). AFTA and compaction data from the Lower Jurassic succession of the Mochras 461 \nborehole indicate ~2.5 km of early Cretaceous exhumation at that location (Holford et al., 462 \n2005). These observations confirm the regional nature of early Cretaceous cooling and 463 \nexhumation, although slight differences in the timing of cooling between individual areas 464 \nresults in some uncertainty with regards to identification of discrete episodes and their 465 \ncorrelations with events in the stratigraphic record. 466 \n 467 \nEarly Cenozoic (65-60 Ma) 468 \nEarly Cenozoic exhumation of northern Scotland is thought to be a source of Palaeocene 469 \nsediments in the Faroe-Shetland Basin (White & Lovell, 1997; Stoker et al., 2010), and a 470 \nnumber of previous studies have suggested regional Palaeocene uplift and exhumation across 471 \nnorthern Scotland based either on thermochronology (Persano et al., 2007) or geophysical 472 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  20 \nstudies (Jones et al., 2002). However, our AFTA data shows that early Cenozoic cooling is 473 \nrestricted dominantly to the vicinity of Palaeogene igneous centres (e.g. Skye, Mull) (Fig. 474 \n7c). Away from these intrusions, early Cenozoic palaeotemperatures decrease rapidly, whilst 475 \nsome regions such as the WOB show no obvious requirement for early Cenozoic cooling 476 \n(Fig. 7b), and earlier or later cooling episodes dominate the thermal histories.  477 \n 478 \nThe clearest evidence for elevated early Cenozoic palaeotemperatures is provided by Jurassic 479 \nAFTA samples from Skye, where all but one sample show evidence for palaeotemperatures 480 \n>110\u00b0C prior to cooling beginning between 65 and 60 Ma (Table 2). This is consistent with 481 \nprevious results from Skye that also reveal early Cenozoic palaeotemperatures >110\u00b0C 482 \n(Lewis et al., 1992). In contrast, VR data from onshore Middle Jurassic sediments in the 483 \nInner Hebrides signify localized elevated palaeotemperatures around contemporaneous 484 \nigneous intrusions, while away from intrusive bodies VR values are much lower (Hudson and 485 \nAndrews, 1987). The compaction and cementation state of these sandstones suggest 486 \nmaximum burial depths of only ~1 km (Hudson and Andrews, 1987), indicating that the early 487 \nCenozoic palaeotemperatures of >110\u00b0C revealed by AFTA most likely do not reflect solely 488 \ndeeper burial, but are more likely due to hydrothermal and\/or contact heating, similar to that 489 \nobserved in the 134\/5-1 well (Fig. 5c) Thus, whilst early Cenozoic cooling recorded by 490 \nAFTA data in some samples may in part record regional exhumation, over much of this 491 \nregion it is difficult to isolate this signal from thermal effects related to igneous activity. But 492 \nin other areas (e.g. WOB) early Cenozoic exhumation is clearly of lower magnitude than that 493 \nduring the early Cretaceous and mid-late Cenozoic. 494 \n 495 \n 496 \n 497 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  21 \nMid-Cenozoic (45-20 Ma)      498 \nData from 134\/5-1 and 202\/19-1 reveal evidence for mid-Cenozoic cooling. Samples from 499 \n134\/5-1 provide the most detailed definition of this episode, showing cooling beginning 500 \nbetween 45 and 20 Ma and indicating exhumation of Lower Jurassic and older rocks 501 \ninvolving removal of ~0.6-0.9 of additional section (Fig. 5). Results from 202\/19-1 are 502 \nconsistent with a similar timing, while requiring a larger amount of removed section. This 503 \ncooling and exhumation is contemporaneous with a regional Upper Eocene (~34\u00b13 Ma) 504 \nunconformity reported from the Atlantic margin (Praeg et al., 2005) and coeval with 505 \nprogradation of early Oligocene clastic wedges into the eastern North Sea, which is taken to 506 \nrecord the onset of Scandinavian uplift (Japsen et al., 2007). Jolivet (2007) provides evidence 507 \nfor similarly timed (40-25 Ma) cooling onshore Scotland recorded by apatite fission track 508 \ndata from Loch Ness and Strontian. Jolivet (2007) interpreted this data in terms of ~1.6 to 2 509 \nkm of post mid-Cenozoic denudation. 510 \n 511 \nThere are at least three outliers of late Oligocene terrestrial sediments within our study area 512 \n(Fig. 1). Sediments reach a maximum thickness of ~1 km in the Canna Basin, and in all areas 513 \nare variably tilted and folded, and overlain with marked unconformity by Quaternary deposits 514 \n(Fyfe et al., 1993). Lithologies (freshwater mudstones, sandstones and lignites) are similar to 515 \nother Oligocene terrestrial deposits in western Britain (e.g. Lough Neagh, Cardigan Bay 516 \nbasins). Compaction and palaeothermal data show that these sediments have been exhumed 517 \nby up to 1.5 km (Holford et al., 2005, 2009b). No such data exist for the Oligocene outliers 518 \noffshore Scotland, but their preservation and deformation point to complex local variations in 519 \nmid-Cenozoic vertical motions. 520 \n 521 \n 522 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  22 \nLate Cenozoic (15-10 Ma) 523 \nMost AFTA samples reveal major late Cenozoic cooling from palaeotemperatures of ~60-524 \n65\u00b0C to their present-day temperatures (Fig. 7d; Table 1). Data from most regions are 525 \nconsistent with a regionally synchronous onset between 15 and 10 Ma (Fig. 3, 6). AFTA 526 \nsamples from the WOB suggest an earlier (30-15 Ma) onset, although this could represent the 527 \ncombined effects of mid and late Cenozoic cooling. In contrast to earlier uplift episodes 528 \nwhere there is often uncertainty as to the amount of subsequent reburial, we can quantify the 529 \namount of reburial following late Cenozoic uplift because Quaternary sedimentary 530 \nthicknesses are well constrained (generally <100 m) (e.g. Fyfe et al., 1993; Stoker et al., 531 \n1993). We use late Cenozoic palaeotemperatures to estimate amounts of exhumation since 532 \nthe late Cenozoic. Gross exhumation estimates (i.e. uncorrected for reburial) have been 533 \ncalculated using minimum, maximum and mid-point palaeotemperature estimates, assuming 534 \na late Cenozoic palaeosurface temperature of 10\u00b0C and  late Cenozoic palaeogeothermal 535 \ngradients  that decrease linearly from 43\u00b0C km-1 at 134\/5-1 to 25.3\u00b0C km-1 at 202\/19-1 (i.e. 536 \nsimilar to the present-day gradients) (Fig. 8). Estimates based on mid-point 537 \npalaeotemperatures show a consistent northwards increase, with lowest values (>0.92 km) in 538 \nthe vicinity of Skye, and highest values (<1.94 km) in the WOB (Fig. 8). Estimates from the 539 \nWOB are similar to late Cenozoic exhumation estimates across the southern British Isles 540 \nfrom AFTA and sonic velocity data (Holford et al., 2005, 2009a). Around major igneous 541 \ncentres (e.g. Mull), a significant fraction of the section eroded during the late Cenozoic may 542 \nhave comprised lavas that accumulated during the Palaeocene (cf. Walker, 1971). 543 \n 544 \nIntegration of AFTA data with stratigraphic constraints on the Morvern peninsula 545 \nFourteen AFTA samples have been analysed from Morvern (Fig. 9), where sedimentary rocks 546 \nof Mesoproterozoic (Moine metasediments; samples GC523-2, RD17-43), Upper 547 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  23 \nCarboniferous (GC523-72 & 74), Triassic (GC523-1 & 3), Lower Jurassic and Upper 548 \nCretaceous (Cenomanian-?Santonian; GC523-4 & 5) ages crop out within an area of ~20 549 \nkm2. In addition there is a ~460 m thick succession of the Palaeocene Mull Lava Group, 550 \nwhilst the eastern part of the peninsula comprises Silurian Strontian granite (RD17-42, 44 to 551 \n48). This area provides a unique opportunity to integrate stratigraphic constraints with 552 \nthermal history information from AFTA to evaluate burial and uplift histories of basement 553 \nand cover rocks. In basement terrains without younger sedimentary cover, the only available 554 \nthermal history constraints for modelling of fission track data are the measured present-day 555 \ntemperature and an assumed depositional\/metamorphic\/crystallisation temperature. However, 556 \nMoine rocks on Morvern are variably overlain by Triassic, Lower Jurassic and Upper 557 \nCretaceous sediments, showing that the basement rocks now exposed across this region had 558 \nbeen exhumed to near-surface levels\/temperatures at these times.  559 \n 560 \nThe Upper Triassic sandstones from which samples GC523-1 and 3 were collected 561 \nunconformably overlie Moine Supergroup metasediments, while the Silurian Strontian 562 \nGranite outcrops nearby (Fig. 9a).  These pre-Caledonian rocks must therefore have been 563 \nexhumed to surface levels by the late Triassic, at which time a regional planation surface had 564 \nbeen created, now represented by the sub-Triassic unconformity. Samples of Moine and 565 \nStrontian Granite from Morvern consistently record cooling from >100\u00b0C that began between 566 \n245 and 225 Ma (Table 2).  In other words, samples now just below the level of the 567 \nunconformity were at paleotemperatures >100\u00b0C a few Myr prior to the time at which they 568 \nreached that position and the overlying Upper Triassic sedimentary units were deposited.  569 \nTherefore we interpret the early Triassic cooling episode as representing the period of 570 \nexhumation that led to formation of the unconformity underlying the Upper Triassic 571 \nsediments (Fig. 9c).  572 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  24 \n 573 \nThe Upper Triassic sandstones are conformably overlain by Lower Jurassic sandstones and 574 \nshales, in turn unconformably overlain by the ~20 m thick Cenomanian (possibly Turonian) 575 \nmarginal marine Loch Aline White Sandstone Formation, indicating the presence of a 576 \nCenomanian coastline (Lowden et al., 1992). The absence of Middle Jurassic to Early 577 \nCretaceous section indicates a period of erosion or non-deposition during this interval. AFTA 578 \ndata from Morvern provide no direct evidence for cooling associated with this unconformity 579 \n(Fig. 9c). But as Jurassic heating and burial and early Cretaceous cooling, exhumation and 580 \ndeformation is observed in northern parts of our study area we suggest it is also likely to have 581 \noccurred in Morvern, but palaeotemperatures associated with this episode were subsequently 582 \noverprinted by higher early Cenozoic paleotemperatures (below).  583 \n 584 \nMost samples of Moine and Strontian Granite, as well as the two samples of Upper Triassic 585 \nsandstone, record reheating to ~80-90\u00b0C or above in the early Cenozoic (Table 2).  This event 586 \nis also recorded in samples GC523-4 and 5 from the Loch Aline Sandstone (Table 2), which 587 \nshow that following deposition at ~95 Ma, it was heated to 90-105\u00b0C in the Early Cenozoic. 588 \nOver 100 m of Upper Carboniferous (Westphalian) sandstones and mudstones occur in a 589 \nfaulted inlier on the southern coast of Morvern.   While the relationship between this and 590 \nyounger units is not clear, thermal histories of AFTA samples GC523-72 and 74 are similar 591 \nto the Cenomanian samples, defining early Cenozoic palaeotemperatures of ~100\u00b0C (Fig. 9c).  592 \n 593 \nAs noted earlier, early Cenozoic paleotemperatures across the study region are interpreted as 594 \ndominantly reflecting processes related to igneous activity, chiefly contact and hydrothermal 595 \neffects as well as locally elevated heat flow and possibly deeper burial, and the effects of 596 \nthese competing processes cannot be resolved.  But if the early Cenozoic paleotemperatures 597 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  25 \nin these samples involved any degree of deeper burial, it is clear that the entire section must 598 \nhave been reburied following deposition of the Cenomanian sandstone, to achieve these early 599 \nCenozoic palaeotemperatures. Burial beneath a late Cretaceous Chalk cover seems plausible. 600 \nWhile Upper Cretaceous strata are poorly represented in this area, sediments of this age are 601 \nidentified in Skye, Raasay and Eigg, and Chalk Group fragments of possible Campanian age 602 \noccur in volcanic vents in Arran (Fyfe et al., 1993). If such burial occurred, early Palaeocene 603 \nexhumation must have occurred to produce the predominantly subaerial landsurface onto 604 \nwhich lavas and pyroclastic material were erupted (Emeleus & Bell, 2005). Alternatively, 605 \nearly Cenozoic palaeotemperatures could be related to hydrothermal and other effects 606 \nassociated with volcanic activity during or subsequent to extrusion of lavas, although in this 607 \ncase, reheating from near-surface temperatures is still required (Fig. 9c). 608 \n 609 \nLate Cenozoic (20-10 Ma) paleotemperatures around 60-70\u00b0C are also recorded in almost all 610 \nsamples from Morvern, as well as other areas in this study (although results in some samples 611 \nfrom Morvern may represent the unresolved effects of both early and late Cenozoic episodes; 612 \nTable 2). The presence of the volcanic sequence and the underlying sub-aerial surface shows 613 \nthat the section must have been re-buried.  The Mull Lava Group has a thickness of ~460 m 614 \non Morvern, and zeolite minerals (e.g. mesolite, laumonite) within the lavas indicate this area 615 \nmay have been buried by >1 km of additional lavas (Bell & Williamson, 2002). The depth-616 \nrelated zeolite zones are superimposed on hydrothermal mineral zones related to the Mull 617 \nCentral Complex (Bell & Williamson, 2002), and a zone of Carbonate minerals on western 618 \nMorvern is interpreted to have been deposited by circulating heated waters from the 619 \nArdnamurchan Central Complex (Walker, 1971).   620 \n 621 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  26 \nIntegration of AFTA data from various stratigraphic levels with geological evidence thus 622 \nreveal a complex history of post-Caledonian vertical motions across Morvern (Figure 9c). 623 \nMoine basement rocks have been repeatedly buried then exhumed to surface levels, and at 624 \nleast three major cycles of heating and cooling have been identified. This is in stark contrast 625 \nto the monotonic post-Caledonian cooling histories proposed for this region by 626 \nthermochronological studies that have focused on basement rocks rather than younger 627 \nsedimentary cover (e.g. Persano et al., 2007).  We suggest that such episodic histories are 628 \nunlikely to be restricted to this one location, and that such histories are likely to be the rule, 629 \nrather than the exception. 630 \n 631 \nDiscussion 632 \nNew AFTA data from northwest Scotland reveal a complex history of vertical motions 633 \ncharacterized by multiple cycles of Mesozoic-Cenozoic burial and exhumation (Fig. 10). Our 634 \ndata reveal regional cooling and uplift episodes that began during the early-mid Triassic 635 \n(245-225 Ma), early Cretaceous (140-120 Ma), early Cenozoic (65-60 Ma), mid Cenozoic 636 \n(45-20 Ma) and late Cenozoic (15-10 Ma) (Fig. 3, 6). AFTA data in Permian-Mesozoic units 637 \nfrom offshore wells allow evaluation of palaeogeothermal gradients and indicate that deeper 638 \nburial is the primary cause of heating, and that exhumation is the main cause of cooling in 639 \nthese episodes, except for early Cenozoic heating which appears in large part to be related to 640 \nigneous activity. The Cenozoic history of uplift and erosion is consistent with the offshore 641 \nsedimentary record to the north and west of our study area, with multiple tectonically-642 \ninfluenced sedimentation pulses of Palaeocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and Plio-643 \nPleistocene observed in the Rockall and Faroe-Shetland basins (Stoker et al, 2010). Our 644 \nresults, which indicate a major role for Cenozoic tectonics in the development of the Scottish 645 \nlandscape, are worth comparing with recent geomorphological studies of Ireland (Dewey, 646 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  27 \n2000), which indicate that many topographic features may owe their origin due to faults 647 \nactive during Palaeogene extension and Neogene compression. 648 \n 649 \nJurassic sedimentary cover over the Highlands? 650 \nA key aspect of our results is that many Permian-Triassic samples appear to have reached 651 \ntemperatures of 90-100\u00b0C or above in the early Cretaceous. Samples of basement and 652 \nPalaeozoic sediments give comparable results, implying similar geological histories for 653 \nbasement terrains and sedimentary basins over the past ~200 Myr. The sedimentary basins of 654 \nthe Hebrides contain thick successions of marine Jurassic rocks (e.g. ~2.5 km in the NMB; 655 \nFyfe et al., 1993), and our results imply that comparable successions were deposited where 656 \nJurassic rocks are now missing, including across the northern Highlands. Sequence-657 \nstratigraphic analyses of Middle-Upper Jurassic marine sediments in the Inner Moray Firth 658 \nand Hebridean basins reveal stratigraphic affinities that imply a marine connection (Underhill 659 \nand Partington, 1993). Underhill (1991) postulated that such a connection may have existed 660 \nalong the trace of the Great Glen Fault. Roberts & Holdsworth (1999) argued that the 661 \nHighlands were traversed by a component of Mesozoic extension along NNE-SSW trending 662 \nfaults, and that many structures that are traditionally held to be Caledonian may in fact be of 663 \nMesozoic age. Quartz-filled fractures within Cambrian rocks west of the Moine Thrust Zone 664 \nprovide independent evidence for Mesozoic extension (Laubach & Diaz-Tushman, 2009). 665 \nThese fractures strike N-NE and are associated with post-Caledonian faults, leading Laubach 666 \n& Diaz-Tushman (2009) to attribute their formation to Mesozoic extension. Fluid inclusion 667 \nhomogenization temperatures show these fractures formed at ~80\u00b0C, in good agreement with 668 \nearly Mesozoic palaeotemperatures predicted by thermal modelling of AFTA samples that 669 \nfrom the northwest coast (Fig. 7b). AFTA indicate that a maximum of 2-3 km of Jurassic 670 \nsediments have been removed from northern parts of the Hebridean basin system (e.g. the 671 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  28 \nWest Orkney Basin) during post-Jurassic exhumation. Lower exhumation is likely in 672 \nsouthern areas where thicker Mesozoic sequences are preserved (e.g. in the vicinity of Skye, 673 \nwhere a thick Jurassic succession is preserved, diagenetic evidence suggests deeper burial of 674 \nthese rocks by ~1 km (Hudson & Andrews, 1987) 675 \n 676 \nImplications for low-temperature thermal histories of basement regions 677 \nThe repeated cycles of heating and cooling revealed by our data and implied by the 678 \ngeological record are in marked contrast to the results of a recent study that presented apatite 679 \nfission-track and (U-Th)\/He (AHe) data from two locations in northwest Scotland; Clisham 680 \n(Achaean gneisses) and Sgorr Dhonuill (Silurian granites) (Persano et al., 2007). Persano et 681 \nal. (2007) interpreted their data as recording continuous, monotonic cooling over the past 400 682 \nMy (i.e. consistent with continuous post-Caledonian emergence), with an early Cenozoic 683 \nacceleration in cooling. Their approach was based on forward modelling of fission-track and 684 \nAHe data to indentify thermal histories that were consistent with the observed fission track 685 \nand AHe ages.  686 \n 687 \nPersano et al (2007) extracted thermal history constraints from their AHe data using the 688 \nsystematics of He diffusion in apatite defined for Durango apatite by Farley (2000). Although 689 \nthese systematics have been widely adopted, recent studies have shown that He diffusion in 690 \napatite is more complicated than originally supposed. Green at al. (2006) reported systematic 691 \ninconsistencies between measured AHe ages and values predicted on the basis of thermal 692 \nhistories derived from AFTA using the Farley (2000) systematics, with discrepancies 693 \nincreasing with U content of the apatite and the fission track age. Further empirical data 694 \nshowing similar effects (Flowers et al., 2007), combined with new experimental 695 \ninvestigations of AHe diffusion kinetics (Shuster et al., 2006) have shown that apatite 696 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  29 \nbecomes more retentive of He as radiation damage accumulates within the crystal lattice. 697 \nConsequently, apatites with high effective U (eU) concentrations and older fission track ages 698 \nretain He at much higher temperatures than young apatites with low eU concentrations such 699 \nas Durango apatite (Shuster et al., 2006). Because Persano et al. (2007) did not consider the 700 \neffects of radiation damage, the thermal history interpretations they derive from the AHe data 701 \ncannot be considered reliable. For all samples where Persano et al. (2007) report both AHe 702 \nand fission track ages, the latter are considerably older than 100 Ma (the youngest being a 703 \nvalue of 186\u00b16 Ma sample in SD9), and so the interpretation of the AHe data in these 704 \nsamples by Persano et al. (2007) using the Farley (2000) systematics in terms of an early 705 \nCenozoic acceleration in cooling is unlikely to be valid (Green et al., 2006). 706 \n 707 \nEven if this interpretation was accurate, it is far from straightforward to attribute early 708 \nCenozoic cooling solely to regional exhumation, given the results here which suggest a link 709 \nto contemporaneous igneous activity (Fig. 2, 5b). Whilst it remains possible that regional 710 \nPalaeocene exhumation may contribute to early Cenozoic cooling, further work is needed to 711 \nisolate this signal from cooling resulting from the cessation of hydrothermal heating, contact 712 \neffects and more localised exhumation caused by intrusion of central complexes (Brown et 713 \nal., 2009).  714 \n 715 \nLow-temperature thermochronological studies of basement rocks from onshore passive 716 \nmargins and continental interiors commonly assume monotonic cooling (e.g. Dempster & 717 \nPersano, 2006). However, our results, best demonstrated by samples from the Morvern 718 \npeninsula (Fig. 9), indicate that episodic histories dominated by repeated cycles of heating 719 \nand cooling (i.e. burial and exhumation) are more realistic. The common assumption of 720 \nmonotonic cooling histories for low temperature thermochronological studies is only possible 721 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  30 \noccurs because such studies traditionally focus on basement rocks and ignore the significance 722 \nof any sedimentary outliers that may be present (Green and Duddy, 2007). We suggest that 723 \nthis naive approach can lead to erroneous conclusions, and is no longer tenable. 724 \n 725 \nOrigin of uplift episodes 726 \nA synthesis of AFTA data from multiple wells and outcrops in the Irish Sea basins by 727 \nHolford et al. (2009a) identified regional (up to ~106 km2) exhumation-driven cooling 728 \nepisodes beginning during the early Cretaceous and the early, mid and late-Cenozoic that can 729 \nbe correlated with the episodes observed in northwest Scotland. These results suggest greater 730 \ncomplexity than previous studies that have suggested that exhumation across the western 731 \nBritish Isles is dominantly Palaeogene in age, driven by plume-related igneous underplating 732 \n(Brodie & White, 1994; White & Lovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002; Persano et al., 2007). 733 \nWhilst underplating may well have contributed to the localized early Palaeogene exhumation 734 \naround Hebridean igneous centres, underplating and dynamic uplift cannot explain the 735 \nTriassic and early Cretaceous exhumation of northwest Scotland, and we consider it unlikely 736 \nthat the mid and late Cenozoic exhumation episodes constrained by our AFTA data were 737 \nprimarily plume-driven. 738 \n 739 \nHolford et al. (2009a) noted close temporal relationships between the onset of Cretaceous-740 \nCenozoic exhumation episodes across the western British Isles and plate boundary 741 \nreorganizations associated with the North Atlantic oceanic ridge system, and increased 742 \nperiods of convergence and coupling between the Eurasian and African plates associated with 743 \nAlpine collision. These correlations suggest that increased levels of intraplate stress 744 \npropagated from plate boundary interactions may explain the exhumation episodes 745 \nconstrained by AFTA data. Present-day stress data from northwest Europe indicate a 746 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  31 \nnorthwest-southeast orientation of maximum horizontal stress in the upper crust consistent 747 \nwith control by plate boundary forces (Goelke & Coblentz, 1996). Cenozoic compressional 748 \nstress magnitudes in particular are likely to have been high (perhaps ~100 MPa) due to ridge 749 \npush forces enhanced by anomalously high temperature asthenosphere underlying the 750 \nelevated northeast Atlantic spreading axis, which is above sea level at Iceland (Bott, 1993; 751 \nDor\u00e9 et al., 2008). High magnitudes of intraplate stress can explain the large number of 752 \nCretaceous-Cenozoic compressional structures in post-Palaeozoic basins of the British Isles 753 \nand Atlantic Margin that contain weak sedimentary infills (Hillis et al., 2008). It may also 754 \nexplain uplift of \u2018uninverted\u2019 basement regions due to the distributed effects of relatively low 755 \nstrain rates (<10-16 s-1) operating over timescales of >1-10 Myr. The resultant cumulative 756 \ncrustal shortening, although relatively minor (<5-10%) may nonetheless be sufficient to 757 \ngenerate long-wavelength uplift and exhumation. Low degrees of crustal shortening have 758 \nbeen invoked to explain late Cenozoic uplift and deformation of other intraplate regions e.g. 759 \nthe West Siberian Basin (Allen & Davies, 2007) and the margins of the Australian continent 760 \n(Sandiford et al., 2004).  761 \n 762 \nConclusions 763 \nWe have constrained post-Caledonian vertical motions around northwest Scotland using 78 764 \nAFTA samples from onshore outcrops, and offshore shallow boreholes and deep exploration 765 \nwells. Samples came from both Proterozoic-Lower Palaeozoic basement and Mesozoic cover 766 \nsequences. Our results indicate multiple Mesozoic-Cenozoic cooling and exhumation 767 \nepisodes, several of which correlate with similar events recorded by AFTA data throughout 768 \nwestern Britain. Thermal histories of basement and cover samples are generally consistent, 769 \nand many Permian-Triassic samples cooled from temperatures of 90-100\u00b0C or above during 770 \nthe Cretaceous. These results require deposition of considerable additional thicknesses of 771 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  32 \nTriassic-Jurassic rocks in the Hebridean basins, and suggest deposition of Mesozoic 772 \nsediments across the Highlands. This additional cover was removed during regional early 773 \nCretaceous and mid-late Cenozoic exhumation. AFTA data record early Cenozoic heating 774 \nand cooling, but it is difficult to isolate the contribution by regional uplift from thermal 775 \neffects associated with igneous activity. Combined with preserved stratigraphy which records 776 \nintermittent Upper Palaeozoic-Mesozoic sedimentation across northwest Scotland, our data 777 \nare incompatible with a significant Caledonian component in the present-day topography. 778 \nInstead, tectonic processes have repeatedly uplifted northwest Scotland over the past ~140 779 \nMyr and erosion has stripped away a considerable thickness of cover. Our results emphasize 780 \nthe importance of integrating thermal history data from basement and overlying sedimentary 781 \nunits when reconstructing the uplift histories of onshore passive margins and intraplate 782 \nregions, and also demonstrate the importance of integrating observations from onshore and 783 \noffshore.     784 \n 785 \nAcknowledgements 786 \nThis work forms part of ARC Discovery Project DP0879612, and represents TRaX 787 \ncontribution #75.

Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  44 \nFig. 2 Mean fission track ages plotted against mean track lengths for apatite fission track data used in this study, 1067 \nalongside previously published data from northwest Scotland (Lewis et al., 1992 (margins of Sea of Hebrides 1068 \nBasin); Thomson et al., 1999 (northern Highlands); Jolivet, 2007 (Loch Ness, Strontian); Persano et al., 2007 1069 \n(Clisham, Sgorr Dhonuill)). All errors shown at \u00b11\u03c3. Most fission track ages are younger than 300 Ma, 1070 \nsuggesting these samples reached late Palaeozoic-Mesozoic palaeotemperatures sufficient to produce severe age 1071 \nreduction (i.e. >100\u00b0C). Ages from Skye and Mull mostly range between 50-70 Ma, similar to the timing of 1072 \nigneous activity in these regions, and suggesting that related thermal effects heavily influence fission track data 1073 \nfrom these regions. A typical \u2018boomerang trend\u2019 based on AFTA data from the Lake District (Green, 1986) is 1074 \nshown in the background. 1075 \n 1076 \nFig. 3 Comparison of the timing information derived from all AFTA data that show evidence for higher 1077 \npalaeotemperatures post-deposition\/intrusion\/metamorphism. Synthesis of results identifies a number of discrete 1078 \nphases of cooling, indicated by the vertical bands. Open boxes and arrow indicate the range of stratigraphic ages 1079 \nfor individual samples. Horizontal bands define range of timing for the onset of cooling derived from AFTA 1080 \ndata in each sample within a 95% confidence interval. Note that for several samples from 202\/19-1 the timing 1081 \nestimates for individual estimates show some overlap. Timing estimates have been shifted vertically where this 1082 \nis the case. 1083 \n 1084 \nFig. 4 AFTA results and thermal history reconstruction for exploration well 202\/19-1. a) Left, fission-track 1085 \nages; right, mean track lengths, both plotted against depth below kelly bushing. Black lines show increasing 1086 \nstratigraphic age with depth. Greyscale lines show the predicted patterns of fission-track age and mean track 1087 \nlength from the DTH for apatites containing 0.0-0.1, 0.4-0.5, 0.9-1.0 and1.5-1.6 wt% Cl. The DTH is based on 1088 \nthe burial history derived from the sedimentary section intersected by the well, combined with the present-day 1089 \ngeothermal gradient of 25.3\u00b0C km-1 determined from corrected BHT values in this well. The fission-track ages 1090 \ndecrease with depth and are much less than the values predicted from the DTH, indicating that the sampled 1091 \nsedimentary units have been hotter in the past. b) Palaeotemperature constraints from AFTA data plotted against 1092 \ndepth. AFTA data define two separate phases of cooling that have affected the preserved Permian-Triassic 1093 \nsuccession that began during the early Cretaceous (110 to 90 Ma) and Cenozoic (55 to 10 Ma).  c) Ranges of 1094 \namounts of removed section and palaeogeothermal gradients (hyperbolic ellipsoids) required to explain the early 1095 \nCretaceous and Cenozoic palaeotemperatures. The hyperbolic ellipsoids define the parameter ranges estimated 1096 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  45 \nfrom AFTA that are consistent with the respective palaeotemperature constraints within 95% confidence limits. 1097 \nBlack dots indicate the corresponding maximum likelihood solutions. Horizontal shaded band shows amount of 1098 \nremoved section independently estimated from sonic velocity data (Evans, 1997).  1099 \n 1100 \nFig. 5 AFTA results and thermal history reconstruction for exploration well 134\/5-1. a) Left, fission-track ages; 1101 \nright, mean track lengths, both plotted against depth below kelly bushing. Black lines show increasing 1102 \nstratigraphic age with depth. Greyscale lines show predicted patterns of fission-track age and mean track length 1103 \nfrom the DTH based on the preserved sedimentary section for apatites containing 0.0-0.1, 0.4-0.5, 0.9-1.0 1104 \nand1.5-1.6 wt% Cl. The DTH for this well has been determined using the revised geothermal gradient of 43\u00b0C 1105 \nkm-1 that is with AFTA data. b) Palaeotemperature constraints from AFTA and vitrinite reflectance (VR) data 1106 \nplotted against depth. AFTA and VR data define two episodes of Cenozoic cooling. Samples recording early 1107 \nCenozoic (~60 Ma) palaeotemperatures are closely associated with coeval igneous intrusions and define no 1108 \nlinear trend with depth, suggesting that cooling occurred following the cessation of contact and hydrothermal 1109 \nheating associated with igneous activity. Samples recording mid-Cenozoic (45 to 20 Ma) palaeotemperatures 1110 \ndefine a linear profile with depth which has a similar gradient to that of the present-day temperature profile. (c) 1111 \nMid-Cenozoic cooling in these samples is explained by removal of ~0.6 to 0.9 km of post-Lower Jurassic 1112 \nsection during a denudation episode which began between 45 and 20 Ma, for a palaeogeothermal gradient equal 1113 \nto the revised present-day value of 43\u00b0C km-1.  1114 \n 1115 \nFig. 6 Post-400 Ma event diagram for northwest Scotland, comparing generalized stratigraphy with AFTA-1116 \nconstrained cooling episodes defined in this study and in the western British Isles (Holford et al., 2009a). 1117 \n 1118 \nFig. 7 Palaeotemperatures across northwest Scotland in each of the regional palaeothermal episodes defined in 1119 \nthis study. a) Triassic (220-195 Ma in the Outer Hebrides and 245-225 Ma in Morvern and central Scotland). 1120 \nLighter shading shows surface\/seafloor outcrops of Permian-Triassic rocks, darker shading shows outcrops of 1121 \nJurassic rocks. b) Early Cretaceous (110-90 Ma in the West Orkney Basin and 140-130 Ma in the Hebridean 1122 \nregion). Lighter shading shows surface\/seafloor outcrops of Permian-Triassic rocks, darker shading shows 1123 \noutcrops of Jurassic rocks. c) Early Palaeogene (65-60 Ma in Skye, Mull and Morvern, 75-40 Ma in the 1124 \nHebridean region). Diagonal shading shows seafloor outcrops of Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, hatched shading 1125 \nshows surface\/seafloor outcrops of Palaeogene igneous extrusive rocks, grey shading shows surface\/seafloor 1126 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  46 \noutcrops of Palaeogene intrusive rocks. d) Mid-late Cenozoic (30-15 Ma in West Orkney Basin, 15-10 Ma in 1127 \nHebridean region, 40-25 Ma in 134\/5-1 and 20-10 Ma in Skye, Mull and Morvern). 1128 \n 1129 \nFig. 8 Mid-late Cenozoic exhumation estimates across northwest Scotland based on AFTA data. a) Estimates 1130 \nbased on mid-point temperature for each sample, assuming a surface temperature of 10\u00b0C and a geothermal 1131 \ngradient that decreases linearly from 43\u00b0C km-1 at 134\/5-1 to 25.3\u00b0C km-1 at 202\/19-1. b) Horizontal bars 1132 \nrepresent the range of gross exhumation for each sample location (reflecting the range of palaeotemperatures 1133 \nestimated from AFTA), and thickness of Quaternary deposits (i.e. post-exhumation reburial). Adding the 1134 \nthickness of Quaternary sediments to the gross estimates gives an estimate of net exhumation for each location. 1135 \nResults indicate that large areas of northwest Scotland and its offshore basins have had >0.5-1.0 km of section 1136 \nremoved during late Cenozoic exhumation.  1137 \n 1138 \nFig. 9 AFTA data from the Morvern peninsula. a) Geological map of the Morvern peninsula. b) Thermal 1139 \nhistories for AFTA samples from various stratigraphic levels. Results indicate exhumation of basement rocks to 1140 \nsurface levels by the late Triassic, following which they were reheated during late-Triassic-Jurassic burial, and 1141 \nthen cooled through several stages of Cretaceous-Cenozoic exhumation. c) Schematic post-400 Ma thermal 1142 \nhistory of the Morvern peninsula reconciling results from all AFTA samples.    1143 \n 1144 \nFig. 10 Schematic ~E-W cross-sections illustrating our preferred model for the post-Caledonian geological 1145 \nevolution of northwest Scotland. (a) Early Devonian post-orogenic uplift witnessed by the unroofing of the 1146 \nNewer Granites (Watson, 1985; Hall, 1991). (b) Devonian extensional collapse and subsidence permitting 1147 \ndeposition of >2-3 km  of Devonian and Lower Carboniferous rocks (Thomson et al., 1999). (c) Late 1148 \nCarboniferous deformation and uplift related to far-field Variscan compression  (Underhill et al., 2008) 1149 \nremoving Devonian and Carboniferous sediments. (d) Late Triassic-Jurassic extension and subsidence leading to 1150 \nformation of Hebridean basins (Fyfe et al., 1993) but also affecting pre-Caledonian basement rocks (Roberts & 1151 \nHoldsworth, 1999). Localised uplift in footwalls of major faults, and regional uplift of basement rocks in 1152 \nwestern and central Scotland. Maximum post-Caledonian burial depths across northwest Scotland are attained 1153 \nduring the late Jurassic-early Cretaceous with up to 2-3 km of subsequently eroded syn and post-rift Jurassic 1154 \nrocks deposited across this region. (e) Early Cretaceous regional uplift and exhumation beginning ~120 Ma 1155 \nfollowed by late Cretaceous sea level rises permitting Chalk deposition (f). (g) Localised early Cenozoic uplift 1156 \nHolford et al.                                                           Post-Caledonian exhumation of northwest Scotland \n  47 \n(beginning ~65-60 Ma) around Palaeogene igneous intrusive centres. Considerable thicknesses of lavas 1157 \naccumulate in some areas (e.g. around Mull), much of which are eroded during later exhumation. (h) Regional 1158 \nexhumation beginning during the mid-Cenozoic (40-25 Ma) and late Cenozoic (15-0 Ma) removing up to 1.9 1159 \nkm of overburden, followed by  Pliocene-Pleistocene uplift not directly constrained by our AFTA data but 1160 \nwitnessed by shelf-slope wedges of clastic sediment that prograde away from northwest Scotland (Stoker et al., 1161 \n1993). 1162 \n 1163 \nTable 1 Apatite fission track analysis sample details. 1164 \n 1165 \nTable 2 Summary of palaeotemperatures analysis and Default Thermal History interpretations. 1166 \n202\/19-1\n134\/5-1\n523-10\n523-83, 84\n523-88\n523-89\n523-91\n523-99\n523-102 523-105\n523-109\n523-108\n523-106\n523-6,8\n523-80\n523-110\n523-111\n523-112\n503-184\n523-93\n523-95 523-97\n523-98\n523-11\n523-13\n523-14\n523-15\n503-185\n523-24\n523-47\n503-146\n503-147\n503-148\n503-149\n503-150\n503-151\n523-23\n523-48523-51\n523-49\n523-52\n523-55\n523-56\nFig. 9\n523-77\n523-78\n523-79 523-71\n523-1,2,3\n523-72,74523-4,5\n523-9\nRD17-41\nRD17-42\nRD17-43\nRD17-44\nRD17-47,48\nRD17-45,46\n56\u00b0N\n58\u00b0N\n8\u00b0W 6\u00b0W 4\u00b0W 2\u00b0W\nMF\nNHNMB\nHS\nWSB\nWOB\nOH\nLMT\nSOHB\nIMF\nWF\nHF\nM\nF\nGG\nF\nCF\nSK\nF HB\nF\nST\nF\nWLB\nWFB\nk, j, pt\nk, j, pt\nS\nM\nCB\nSD\nCL\nk\ncz\ncz\ncz\nj\nj\npt\npt\npt\npt\npt\npt\npt\npt\nj\npt\ncz\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nj\nd\nd\nd\ndd\nd\nd\nd\nc c\npt\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nCarboniferous \nsediments\nDevonian sediments\nDevonian extrusives\nCretaceous sediments\nPalaeogene intrusives\nPalaeogene extrusives\nCenozoic sediments Jurassic sediments\nCarboniferous \nextrusives\nPermian-Triassic\nsediments\nk\ng\ncz\nc\npt\nj\nd\nd\nc\ng\nHolford et al Figure 1\nSB\nHF\n89\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\nWest Lewis\/West Orkney Basin\nHebrides\nSkye, Mull and Morvern \nLewis et al.
