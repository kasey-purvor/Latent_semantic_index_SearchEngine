These are labour market out-\ncomes that sit uneasily alongside the Commission\u2019s promotion of \u201cdecent work\u201d \n(European Commission, 2006) and which present a significant challenge for European \nsocieties as policy-makers continue to pursue employment flexibility. Recent cross-\nnational research has confirmed this association between \u201cbad jobs\u201d and numerical \nflexibility for many European workers in low-skilled, low-wage employment (Gauti\u00e9 \nand Schmitt, 2010). \nWithin the literature on the effects of labour market flexibility on job quality, \nthere has been an increasing interest in agency work. Whilst agency work still repre-\nsents a small proportion of employment across Europe, it has been the fastest grow-\ning form of numerical flexibility across EU15 countries and is beginning to expand in \nthe new member states (Arrowsmith, 2009). Some studies have challenged the as-\nsumption that this is a \u201cprecarious\u201d form of work, contending that the presence of \nhighly skilled occupations amongst agency workers reflects an aspiration for \u201cportfo-\nlio careers\u201d amongst professionals able to sell their skills in favourable labour market \nconditions (CIETT, 2000; Knell, 2000; Guest, 2004).  \nOther research reasserts the negative aspect of agency work (Campbell & Bur-\ngess, 2001; Silla et al., 2005). The presence of high-skilled agency workers who appear \nto have a preference for agency working over permanent contracts (Kirkpatrick & \nHoque, 2006, Torka & Shyns, 2007) should not obscure the continuing prevalence of \nlow-skilled, low-wage occupations within agency work (Arrowsmith, 2006; Bergstrom \n& Storrie, 2003). Subsequently there has been a renewed interest in low-skilled agency \nworkers, in part due to the emerging issue of migrant agency workers (May et al., \n2006; Mackay & Markova, 2010).  \nThe focus of research on agency work varies depending upon country context. In \nFrance, where agency work is overwhelmingly low skilled, research situates agency \nwork within the wider context of the degradation of work in general and debates \naround \u201cworkplace suffering\u201d following a number of workplace suicides (Sciences \nHumaines, 2005; Lefresne, 2006; Th\u00e9baud-Mony, 2007). Agency work is rarely per-\nceived by French researchers as a positive career choice (Barbier, 2005), though the \n\u2018temporary help\u2019 industry has endeavoured to present agency work as an attractive and \nacceptable form of work. \nA noticeable development in France is the significant proportion of agency work-\ners that make up the workforce of the automobile industry. Both anecdotal and statis-\ntical evidence suggest that car manufacturers are turning to agency work as a consis-\n                                                          \n1.  See Jacques Delors\u2019 (1993). White Paper on \u201cGrowth, Competitiveness, Employment: \nThe Challenges and Ways Forward into the 21st Century\u201d. \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  171 \ntent human resource strategy rather than a means of addressing cyclical peaks in activ-\nity (Larbi & Lecroux 2008). The car sector in France has provided the context for a \nrich body of literature on working conditions and labour relations. It has been an im-\nportant source of data for researchers investigating the nature and experience of work \nin advanced capitalist societies, due to its position as a benchmark for post-war labour \nstandards, and the leading role played by the car industry in the technological and or-\nganisational innovations across the wider economy. Whilst the growth of agency work \nin the sector has been recognised and the voices of agency workers have been in-\ncluded in qualitative research on car plants, they have not been a principal focus of \nstudy. Nor has there been a consistent engagement with the theoretical challenges \nposed by the presence of large proportions of agency workers in the sector. \nThis paper begins the work of addressing this gap, first by presenting a concep-\ntual framework, based upon Burawoy\u2019s (1985) approach to the labour process, which \ntries to capture the specificity of agency work; secondly, by applying this framework to \nan initial analysis of data collected as part of an exploratory study of agency workers in \nthe French car sector. In doing so, the paper presents a strong case for further re-\nsearch on the working lives of agency workers in order to generate both empirical and \ntheoretical advances in the sociology of work. \nThe first part of the paper gives an overview of the main features of agency work \nin France before briefly discussing its growing importance in the automobile sector in \nthe context of other changes that the sector has undergone. There then follows a dis-\ncussion of Burawoy\u2019s (1979, 1985) approach to the labour process which has in-\nformed much of the literature on work in car plants. Burawoy\u2019s understanding of the \nrole of factors external to the workplace is presented as a framework to examine the \nposition of agency work within the contemporary workplace. The final part of the pa-\nper presents a \u2018pilot\u2019 assessment of the adequacy of Burawoy\u2019s conceptual framework \nvia an initial study of agency workers and union representatives in three car assembly \nplants and one large supplier company in France.   \nAgency work in France \nFrance has one of the highest rates of agency work in the European Union and a well-\ndeveloped temporary agency work sector dominated by a small number of large mul-\ntinational temporary placement agencies. Between 2002 and 2006, 25% of jobs created \ninvolved agency contracts (INSEE, 2010). Due to the concentration of agency work  \nin manufacturing industry, agency workers were disproportionately affected by the \neconomic turmoil that engulfed Western economies in 2008. In France 130,000 tem-\nporary agency jobs were lost between 2008\/2009 (INSEE, 2010).  Latest figures put \nthe number of agency workers within the French workforce at 550,000 (Cl\u00e9ment et al., \n2010). Whilst this is lower than the pre-2008 figure of 637,000 (INSEE, 2010), there \nhas been a steady increase in numbers since the low point of the first quarter of 2009 \n(438,6002). Official figures show that during the second quarter of 2010, whilst the \noverall number of jobs fell, a rise in agency work partially offset the decline in overall \nemployment (DARES, 2010). This recovery so soon after such dramatic falls in \n                                                          \n2 INSEE s\u00e9rie longue int\u00e9rim diffusion 30\/06\/2010. \n172  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \nagency labour suggests that companies are using agency work to provide them with \nthe flexibility to rapidly adjust their workforce in response to immediate economic \nshocks and future uncertainty. Within manufacturing, which accounts for over 40% of \nthe volume of agency work (DARES, 2009), it is the automobile industry which is the \nmost prolific user in terms of the proportion of agency work in relation to total work-\nforce. In 2007, agency workers represented 282,000 full-time equivalent posts in the \nFrench automobile sector, making up just fewer than 10% of the total workforce, in \ncontrast to 3.6% for all economic sectors. This figure fell to 263,000 in 2008. Since \nthen, central government subventions to support the car industry, coupled with incen-\ntives to encourage consumers to buy French cars, have helped to produce an increase \nin agency work in the sector (DARES, 2009).  \nThe concentration of agency work in French manufacturing means there is an \nover-representation of low-skilled males amongst agency workers. In 2007, 71% of \nagency workers were men, decreasing to 64% in 2008 due to the loss of agency work \ncontracts in male-dominated industries (DARES, 2009). Three-quarters of agency \nworkers are employed in routine and lower technical occupations (ouvriers qualifi\u00e9s or \nnon-qualifi\u00e9s) in contrast to permanent jobs where these occupations represent a third \nof contracts (Caussain & Krief, 2007). Again the car sector comprises for a large part \nof these statistics with a number of French regions relying upon the automobile sector \nas a major source of employment for young men. Increasingly, access to employment \nin car assembly and equipment plants is through temporary work agencies.  \nLegislation governing agency worker in France is based upon the principle of par-\nity. Agency workers receive the same hourly pay as permanent workers carrying out \nequivalent jobs. In addition, agency workers receive an end of placement bonus to \ncompensate for their lack of job security. However, agency workers tend to be paid \naccording to the lowest hourly wage on the pay scale since they do not accumulate \nyears of seniority. This, coupled with the sporadic nature of placements, explains the \nhigh proportion of agency workers earning on average less than the minimum wage.3  \nThere exists no comprehensive data on the quality of work of agency workers. \nHowever, studies have shown that agency workers are more likely to be exposed to \nlower quality of work than workers with permanent contracts (Erhel et al., 2009). The \nlack of access to training means that low-skilled agency workers have a high probabili-\nty of remaining in precarious work.4 Despite formal rights to training specific to agen-\ncy workers since 1983 and the introduction of the \u201cdroit individuel \u00e0 la formation\u201d (em-\nployee access to training) in 2004, take-up rates are inferior to those of other workers, \ndue to a number of factors, including lack of information about rights (Perez & Tho-\nmas, 2005).  \n                                                          \n3  16.5% of agency workers earned less that 500 Euros per month and 14.8% earned be-\ntween 500 and 1000 Euros (Dares premi\u00e8res informations\/synth\u00e8ses, Septembre 2008). \n4  A study by the Minist\u00e8re du Travail in 2005 found that 70% of agency workers who had \nbeen in agency work the year before were still in temporary employment, while another \nstudy found that 39% of agency workers were still agency workers after a year and 23% \nhad joined the ranks of the unemployed (Erhel et al., 2009, p. 29). \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  173 \nThe promotion of a \u201cpermanent pool of agency workers\u201d in the car sector (Gor-\ngeu & Matthieu, 2009; Erhel et al., 2009) and the steady decline of permanent con-\ntracts makes difficult the transition to stable employment in regions dependent on the \nindustry, particularly for low-skilled workers. Local labour markets, which are depend-\nent on automobile clusters, are highly sensitive to trends in employment and human \nresource strategies of the major car manufacturers. In 2004, Renault and Peugeot-\nCitro\u00ebn PSA accounted for 64% of the 98,000 jobs5 directly linked to the automobile \nsector in the Ile-de-France (IAURIF, 2004). In the north east, where car plants domi-\nnate the economic landscape, between 2008 and 2009 employment declined by 5% \ncompared with 3.6% nationally (INSEE, 2010).  \nThe frequent and on-going use of agency work in jobs (posts) that are associated \nwith the regular business activity of large, locally-embedded manufacturing plants \n(Viprey, 2002) can extend young workers\u2019 period of transition from education to sta-\nble labour market integration. In a region like Franche-Comte, where 20% of agency \nworkers in the region work in the automobile sector (INSEE, 2009) and where 68,000 \njobs are linked to the Peugeot plant in Sochaux (Lemarre, 2009), economic shocks are \na reminder of how the growth of precarious work leaves significant sections of the lo-\ncal labour force exposed to the market. Indeed, those regions where the automobile \nindustry is a major employer suffered disproportionately from the recent economic \ncrisis. \nCar assembly plants, change and legislation \nTemporary agency work is highly regulated in France. Contracts are limited to 18 \nmonths and must be not be associated with the regular and on-going activity of the \nuser firm. However, a number of high profile court rulings in favour of agency work-\ners indicate that the automobile industry engages in human resource practices that ex-\nceed the boundaries of legislation (Viprey, 2002). There is evidence that it repeatedly \ntinkers with job descriptions to circumvent the 18-month limit on agency contracts; \nand recruits production line workers almost exclusively on agency contacts suggesting \nthis practice comprises a \u201cstandard human resource strategy\u201d (Viprey, 2002), to re-\nsolve labour force issues that go beyond those provided for in the legislation.  \nBeaud and Pialoux (1999), in an ethnographic study of the Peugeot factory at \nSochaux in the northeast of France, document the dramatic rise of agency work in the \nplant in the 1980s, where at its peak, agency workers constituted a third of unskilled \nworkers. In the group\u2019s Aulnay plant, north of Paris, agency workers have frequently \naccounted for over a third of the workforce, whilst there has been a steady decline in \nthe numbers of permanent workers (Viprey, 2002). Similar figures can be found \namongst suppliers. Sintax, a sub-contractor to Toyota in Valenciennes, was recently \nsanctioned due to its abusive use of agency work. A court ruled in favour of a group \nof young agency workers who had been working at the plant for periods ranging from \ntwo to five years. These young men had become accustomed to accepting their pre-\ncarious employment status since they felt confident that their contract would continue \n                                                          \n5  The automobile sector accounts for 11% of total employment in the Ile-de-France (IAU-\nIDF, 2004). \n174  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \nto be renewed, given the constantly high proportion of agency workers at the plant. At \none point there were 200 agency workers working alongside 49 employees.6  \nThese examples belie the iconic image that the automobile sector has traditionally \noccupied in European employment relations. Autoworkers have been a stronghold of \nEuropean unions, with levels of union density relatively high in comparison with na-\ntional averages. In addition, the sector is a historically important source of innovation \nin the organisation of work and industrial relations systems associated with Fordist \nproduction regimes. Collective bargaining, framed within the paradigm of the male \nmanufacturing worker and guaranteeing stable employment with clear grading struc-\ntures for job progression is strongly embedded in the labour relations of car plants \n(Pedersini, 2003). \nIn France, the sector has been a model for the social compromise of the Trente \nGlorieuse (post-war boom), a key element of which is the contract of indefinite dura-\ntion (Contrat \u00e0 Dur\u00e9e Indetermin\u00e9e or CDI). From the guarantee of stable employment \nflowed other guarantees enhanced by sector-level collective agreements; minimum \nwage levels, alleviation of social risk such as ill-health, workplace accidents and unem-\nployment, and a special retirement regime to account for the nature of \u201ctravail penible\u201d \n(arduous work).  \nHowever, the automobile industry has also been at the forefront of changes that \nhave challenged this industrial relations model. The externalization through outsourc-\ning of significant parts of the production process and the promotion of numerical \nflexibility driven by the demands of just-in-time and lean production, have under-\nmined trade union collectivism amongst the workforce. Internally, new management \ntechniques, framed by a discourse of participative management and empowerment, \nhave undermined the collective representation of labour upon which the post-war \nmodel is based (Beaud & Pialloux, 1999).  \nThe car sector has been the site of important ethnographic research both in the \n\u2018golden\u2019 period of Taylorist working practices and more recent restructuring of work \norganisation (Beaud & Pialoux, 1999; Danford, 1998, 2000; Durand & Hatzfeld, 2002; \nBouquin, 2006). Many of these studies have worked with labour process theory (see \nBraverman, 1974), in particular the work of Burawoy (1979), as a theoretical frame-\nwork that captures the different and dynamic configurations of management control \nand workers\u2019 consent\/resistance within the diverse range of contemporary work-\nplaces. However, peripheral workers have been largely marginal to this research, often \nreferred to in order to illustrate despotic workplace relations and\/or management at-\ntempts to undermine union organisation (Danford, 1998; Hatzfeld, 2004).  \nBeaud and Pialoux\u2019s (1999) study provides a glimpse into the world of the agency \nworkers at the Sochaux plant. However, this work is also based upon the assumption \nthat agency workers are subject to despotic labour relations due to their precarious \nemployment status. Bouquin (2006), on the other hand, presents a more multifaceted \nanalysis of agency work by identifying sources of consent to work which flow from \n                                                          \n6  See: http:\/\/www.lavoixdunord.fr\/Locales\/Valenciennes\/actualite\/Valenciennes\/2008\/11\/15\/ \narticle_neuf-anciens-interimaires-attaquent-un-s.shtml [Accessed 18th February 2010]. \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  175 \nthis specific form of employment status. It is here that Burawoy\u2019s theory of produc-\ntion politics, which situates workplace interaction within societal relations expressing \nthe degree of compromise and\/or struggle between capital and labour, provides an \nopportunity to explore further how the specific conditions underpinning the labour \nprocess can give rise to different configurations of consent and coercion.  \nWorkers and evolving workplace regimes \nBurawoy\u2019s (1979) seminal work, Manufacturing Consent, was part of a wider trend within \nworkplace sociology focusing upon localised and varied management control strate-\ngies and workers\u2019 responses.7 The conceptualisation of \u2018participation\u2019 and \u2018consent to \nwork\u2019 through the metaphors of \u201cgames\u201d and \u201cmaking out\u201d respectively  serve as a \nconvincing account of the shift from the \u201cdespotic regime\u201d of production, described \nby Marx and re-conceptualised by Braverman (1974), to a \u201chegemonic regime\u201d. In \ncontrast with the despotic regimes associated with primitive capitalist accumulation, a \nhegemonic regime is dependent on generating consent to work rather than relying on \nthe fear produced by the raw necessity of economical survival.   \nBurawoy\u2019s The Politics of Production (1985) went further in theorising how state, \nmarket and social conditions generate the factory regimes in which workplace dynam-\nics are embedded. By connecting the micro-dynamics of workplace relations to macro-\nlevel structures, the workplace is seen as the outcome of the \u201cpolitical apparatus of \nproduction\u201d, the most crucial elements of which are state support for the reproduc-\ntion of labour power and state protection against the arbitrary action of employers8. \nWhilst the latter play a direct role in regulating the employment relation, the former \nattenuates the social relationship upon which capital\u2019s ability to harness labour is \nbased (i.e. the inability of the worker to reproduce his or her labour power outside \nof the wage relationship). This dependency of the worker on the capitalist for sur-\nvival is one of the conditions described by Marx for capital\u2019s despotic control over \nlabour in early industrial capitalism since the worker is compelled to sell his\/her la-\nbour power in order to secure the means of survival. Thus, the replacement of des-\npotism by more subtle forms of control over the labour process in advanced capital-\nist economies is principally the product of negotiated compromises arising from the \nstructured antagonism between capital and labour within and outside the labour \nprocess, rather than a more \u201cenlightened\u201d approach to human resource management \nby employers.  \n                                                          \n7  Burawoy\u2019s contribution to labour process theory is important because he goes beyond \nBraverman\u2019s (1974) emphasis on labour degradation and the structural dynamics of the \ncapitalist labour process. Instead, he focuses on the complex processes that produce the \nvariety of forms of labour surplus extraction and the factors determining their emergence. \nIn particular, he is concerned to place centre stage the individual and collective agency of \nthe worker.  \n8  Burawoy identified two other elements of the political apparatus of production \u2013 compe-\ntition and technology \u2013 which he considered to be subordinate to the  role of the state in \nreproducing labour power and regulating the employment relationship (Burawoy, 1985, p. \n148). \n176  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \nInstitutional mechanisms, such as collective agreements, minimum wages, em-\nployment rights and protection undermine the ability of the employer to exercise un-\nrestrained control over the labour process. The \u201cdespotic regime\u201d gives way to the \n\u201chegemonic regime\u201d, in which employers engage in strategies to elicit consent from \nthe workforce. Different forms and degrees of state intervention generate different \ntypes of hegemonic regime, characterised by different parameters of control, consent \nand resistance. Thus, a new form of regime \u2013 \u2018hegemonic despotism\u2019 \u2013 emerged with \norganisational restructuring, deregulation, welfare state retrenchment and the return of \nmass unemployment in the 1980s. Hegemonic despotism is characterised by the way \nthat fear of \u2018capital flight\u2019 combines with new management techniques, such as per-\nformance related pay, to mobilise the consent of the workforce to the intensification \nof work. \nBurawoy provides a successful account of the dynamic evolution of workplace \nregimes over time and simultaneously identifies the emergence of a new form of re-\ngime within the context of what we now recognise as neo-liberal globalisation. He \ndoes this by first untying the \u201ccompartmentalisation of production and politics\u201d, \nthereby enabling him to argue that there is an interdependent relationship between the \norganisation of work and the state. Second, he insists on the importance of the \u201cpo-\nlitical apparatuses which reproduce those relations of the labour process through the \nregulation of struggles\u201d (1985, p. 122). \nAutoworkers under \u2018hegemonic despotism\u2019 \nThe car industry is seen as \u201can ideal typical example of hegemonic despotism\u201d (Sallaz, \n2004, p. 691). In an increasingly international competitive environment, auto-\nmanufacturers have insisted on the need to emulate forms of work organisation iden-\ntified as the most efficient in order to guarantee the survival of the firm. The risk of \nlosing competitive advantage provides a compelling rationale for the implementation \nof lean production, resulting in a consensus around the \u201cone best way\u201d to organise \nproduction. Workers are said to gain from potential and relative job security in the ex-\nternal context of increased risk, and from less monotonous and alienating work prac-\ntices. Team-based work organisation, quality circles that provide a space for active \nproblem solving and HRM practices, which promote high-commitment and \u201cshared \ndestiny\u201d (Oliver & Wilkinson, 1992), are all part of the package presented to the work-\nforce in the \u201cpost-Fordist\u201d automobile plant. According to this narrative, relations be-\ntween employer and employees are transformed, as workers buy into company goals \nand values of efficiency and quality. In return, workers benefit from skills gained from \nbeing flexible and polyvalent modern workers. The external environment of intense \nglobal competition, including encroachments on labour rights at the state and political \nlevel, provides the conditions for a shift towards market despotism, tempered inter-\nnally by \u2018employee participation\u2019 management practices and a discourse of partnership \nwith trade unions. \nResearch on the evolution of work in the car industry illustrates the varied out-\ncomes of this transformation of work. Whilst there is a strong bias towards negative \noutcomes for workers, the variety of workplace behaviours and responses points to \nthe influence of different layers of context. In particular, national institutional settings \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  177 \nestablish the broad parameters within a wider global context of capital mobility; sec-\ntoral competitive demands set the scene for the organisation of production; and local \nlabour markets and labour movements mediate the negotiations on the shop floor. \nFor example, total quality management and quality circles commonly produce contra-\ndictory outcomes for workers, as a significant proportion actively engage in these \nmanagement controlled forms of employee participation to enhance their work ex-\nperience and therefore prospects (see Danford, 1998). \nThese new configurations of control and consent, however, may not be relevant \nto agency workers. Bouquin (2006) suggests that agency workers are influenced by a \ndifferent type of management control, situated partly in market despotism but also in \naspirations for a permanent contract. This theme is taken further by another body of \nliterature, which focuses on the individual and collective consequences of the agency \nworkers\u2019 unique contractual status. \nTriangular relationships and dual control  \nGottfried (1992) takes as a starting point the triangular relationship between worker, \nagency and user-firm to develop an appropriate theory of control and consent. She \nconcludes that the agency worker is subject to a dualistic system of control \u2013 a con-\ncept that captures the two distinct structures of management \u2013 and the different roles \nof each in regulating and managing agency work. First, there is the self-disciplinary \npressure arising from the continuous need to gain access to paid employment via the \ntemporary employment agency. Once access is (temporarily) gained, control takes \nplace at the point of production. The agency worker must then acquiesce simultane-\nously to the direct supervision of their labour, and the requirements of employment \nagency in order to secure future opportunities. This suggests an intensification of as-\npects of despotic control \u2013 coupled with labour market vulnerability associated with \nthe lack of a permanent contract \u2013 compels agency workers to accept working condi-\ntions that they are unable to influence and likely to be inferior to those of permanent \nco-workers.  \nGottfried (1992) argues, however, that even in this disadvantageous context, con-\nsent can be relevant. Both employment agencies and user-firms tap into the future as-\npirations of agency workers to encourage workplace behaviours of consent and com-\npliance, engaging in discourses which correspond to aspirations, a theme that is taken \nup by Degiuli and Kollmeyer (2007), and which Bouquin (2006) alluded to. Similar \nthemes arise in other research on agency work. The path to secure employment de-\npends upon the ability of the agency worker to present her\/himself as \u201creliably con-\ntingent\u201d (Peck & Theodore, 2001, p. 486), resulting in a high discipline regime which \ngenerates the need for \u201cdeep self-discipline\u201d (Smith, 1998).  \n\u201cDuality of control\u201d gives a central position to the contractual status of agency \nworkers in shaping the specific micro-dynamic interactions of workplace and agency \nsettings. Given that the employment relationship, as an institution, plays a leading role \nin regulating and shaping struggles in the workplace (Burawoy, 1985, p. 123), it fol-\nlows that it is a core aspect of the organisation of work to which production regimes \nare sensitive (Nichols et al., 2004; Steinberg, 2003).  \n178  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \nModified hegemonic despotism?  \nThough hegemonic despotism emerged in the context of generalised employment in-\nsecurity, the permanent employment contract continues to be a key factor tying work-\ners to the company\u2019s survival (Burawoy, 1985, Stewart et al., 2004, Sallaz, 2004). On \nthe other hand, job insecurity is omnipresent for agency workers, regardless of the vi-\nability of the plant. Firm survival strategies frequently involve the shedding of the pe-\nripheral workforce, as recent developments in the auto sector have graphically illus-\ntrated. Therefore, management tend to perceive agency workers as a \u201cbuffer\u201d to pro-\ntect core workers, with the effect that they are principally treated as a part of man-\nagement\u2019s hegemonic armoury rather than subject to it.  \nSimilarly, organisational practices identified in the literature designed to align \nworkers to company goals may not elicit the same response from a section of the \nworkforce that has a time-delimited association with the firm. Agency work, transient \nby nature, may also undermine the development of autonomous teams (Pardi, 2007, \nLepadatu, 2007), whilst the core principles of lean production, centred as they are \naround the need for a skilled, well trained and motivated workforce (Stewart, 1998, \np.219), may not be relevant to those on agency contracts. \nIf these sources of \u2018consent\u2019 do not apply to agency work, is Gottfried\u2019s (1992) \napproach appropriate? Or does it make more sense to fall back on explanations that \nfocus on the increased exposure to the market? Degiuli and Kollmeyer\u2019s (2007) re-\nsearch combines both. Drawing upon Gottfried\u2019s analysis, they identify three practices \nthat combine external sources associated with economic vulnerability. The first two \nare features that have some correspondence to the ideological components of hege-\nmonic despotism: temporary work agencies engage in practices aimed at normalising \nlabour flexibility; agency work is re-branded so that work placements are perceived as \na trial period for permanent employment. All parties have a shared interest; a loyal re-\nlationship with the agency can lead to ongoing placements and an increased chance of \npermanent work. The third source of control is rooted in market despotism and com-\nbines with the former sources of control to generate acceptance coupled with aspira-\ntion, which motivate agency workers to \u201cplay the game\u201d (Burowoy, 1979).  \nWithin the automobile industry, acceptance of agency work may also be a func-\ntion of the demographic characteristics of agency workers, with younger workers be-\ning more accepting of agency contracts as a path into secure employment (Beaud & \nPialoux, 1999). However, where permanent contracts become increasingly illusory, \nand as placements are punctuated with frequent periods of unemployment, the per-\nceived benefits of \u201cplaying the game\u201d may be undermined.  \nData and evidence  \nIn order to establish the adequacy of the theoretical framework outlined above, ex-\nploratory fieldwork was carried out in 2010. Interviews were undertaken with plant-\nbased union representatives and temporary agency workers (TAW) in three car as-\nsembly plants and one large supplier company in France. Three of the union represen-\ntatives also had experience of agency work in the sector. In total, there were eleven in-\nterviewees, six of whom were currently or had previously been agency workers. Two \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  179 \nunions are represented in the sample, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Generale du Travail (CGT) and \nthe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats Solidaires, Unitaires et D\u00e9mocratiques (SUD). One interviewee is \na full-time, national SUD officer. A potentially significant limitation is the absence of \nthe other generally less militant union federations when compared with the more radi-\ncal political traditions of the CGT and SUD (Connolly, 2010).  \nInterviews were largely semi-structured with the aim of eliciting information and \nperceptions on the position of agency workers and their experience of work in the \nsector. The interview guide covered a range of issues pertinent to the working lives of \nagency workers: nature of jobs carried out by agency workers; control over pace of \nwork; relations with co-workers; support and constraints at work; role of temporary \nhelp agencies; attitudes to unions and management; and other themes as they arose \nnaturally from the interviews.  The agency workers interviewed were young, reflecting \nthe demography of agency workers in the sector.  In one case, an interview took place \noutside of a large factory complex on the outskirts of Paris during a change of shift, \nthus rendering the interview more fluid and unstructured. \nInterviews were conducted in French and translated into English. For the pur-\nposes of this exploratory study, the quality of the translations has not been subject to \nvalidation instruments (Brislin, 1980). This was not considered necessary since the aim \nof the data analysis is to identify common emerging themes through an initial analysis \nof the content.  \nOne factory, two workforces \nThe majority of posts are very hard, but there are posts that are even harder. It\u2019s true that \nthe posts which are the most difficult, the hardest physically, are occupied by agency \nworkers. Their salary is calculated at the lowest level, calculated on the basis of the lowest \nsalary. One of the benefits for the workers is the profit sharing bonus. Every three \nmonths we have between 500 and 600 Euros which allows us to breathe a little finan-\ncially. They don\u2019t have this, although they do harder work (Eddie, ex-TAW, union repre-\nsentative, car plant 1). \nAll car plant interviewees spoke of the physically hard nature of the work for all pro-\nduction workers. However, there was a general recognition that agency workers were \nassigned to the most demanding posts. This led to problems with supervisors for \nsome workers as they struggled to keep up with the pace of the work, and fears that \nthey would not be kept on. \nThey will end the contract, they won\u2019t renew the contract.  We signed a contract for two \nmonths, and after he [the supervisor] said to me \u201cyou haven\u2019t done all the operations, we \nare not going to renew the contract\u201d. So for two months we worked, as we say, like dogs \n(Amina, TAW, car plant 2). \nThe expectations of performance were higher for agency workers. For example, Leila \n(car plant 2) discovered after suffering a workplace accident that the task was normally \ncarried out by two permanent workers.  \nThat agency workers are assigned to the most difficult posts is not a revelation \n(Beaud & Pialoux, 1999; Bouquin, 2006). How this effects social relations within the \nworkplace is less known. For example, Bouquin\u2019s (2006) study looked more at the \ngenerational divide between permanent workers and younger agency workers.  Ac-\n180  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \ncording to union representatives, there was no tension in the workforce arising from \nan unequal division of labour, although two agency workers did feel highly aggrieved \nby their inferior work experience in comparison with permanent co-workers. For an-\nother, resentment was directed more towards the firm. Thus, in a context where the \nnumbers of permanent workers in the automobile sector have been steadily declining, \nthe practice of \u201cbuffering\u201d (Sallaz, 2004) permanent workers appears to be taking on a \ndifferent form, whereby they are protected against the harshest jobs but not job loss. \nIt was also suggested that the more intensive pace of work carried out by agency staff \ncould be used by managers as a tougher benchmark for the rest of the workforce.  \nConfining agency workers to the most physically strenuous and repetitive work \nbenefited the company in other ways. According to union representatives, the exten-\nsive use of agency work meant that there was a continuous supply of young and \nphysically fit workers. In assembly workshops, physical deterioration due to the fre-\nquency and rapidity of actions left workers with significant occupational health injuries \nin a short period. Thus, a large disposable workforce reduces the liability for the firm. \nWhilst in their discourse they guarantee a job for life, in reality they have a rapid turnover \nin order to manage the personnel. They overwork the young workers of twenty-five, they \nmake them work to the limit and then you see workers that are wrecked, who have to \nhave an operation on their wrists, who have their joints and back damaged (Eddie, ex-\nTAW, union representative, car plant 1). \nHaving large proportions of agency workers in the most difficult workshops allows \nmanufacturers to renew a workforce subject to rapid physical deterioration. Rather \nthan being marginal, agency work appears to be a key element of human resource \nstrategy.9 There is little incentive to take into account the long-term effects of physi-\ncally demanding work if a significant proportion of the workforce can be easily dis-\ncarded and replaced. This is illustrated by frequent attempts to conceal workplace ac-\ncidents, which may have long-term consequences for those involved. \nAgency workers will disappear from the figures. And what\u2019s more, they are more likely to \nhave accidents because they have less experience. It\u2019s difficult, there is a real fight around \nthis, because when there is a workplace accident, normally the boss must register it, but \nhe doesn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t want to fill out the forms, so he says to the worker \"don\u2019t \nworry about it, go home for a couple of days, when you come back we\u2019ll sort it out, if we \nhave to withdraw you from that post, we\u2019ll put you on a chair for a  few days and you \nwon\u2019t have to do anything\u201d (Pierre, ex-TAW, union representative, car plant 2). \nAnother interviewee reiterated this point: \nAn agency worker who has a work accident...  the agency will put pressure on him not to \ndeclare the accident so that they can make it look as if they\u2019re aren\u2019t accidents, What you \nshould know is there are, on average, 4 accidents a day. Some are registered, others not. \nThey conceal them (Rachid, union representative, car plant 2). \n                                                          \n9 Christian Courouge, a Peugeot worker who collaborated with Pialoux in the study of \nPeugeot\u2019s Sochaux plant, spoke in a radio broadcast on Patrick Jan\u2019s documentary, \u201cOu-\nvrier, c\u2019est pas la classe\u201d, of the fundamental role of agency workers in keeping the plant \ngoing. He claimed that the plant would not be able to function without agency workers \ngiven the high rates of workplace related injuries due to the nature of the work \n[http:\/\/www.la-bas.org\/article.php3?id_article=330]. \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  181 \nWhen agency workers experience accidents in the workplace, the accident is also regis-\ntered with the agency, which is the legal employer, so whilst all workers are subject to \npressure to keep quiet, agency workers are doubly pressurised. One worker, who was \ndue to leave the plant, spoke of the danger of being blacklisted by both the user firm \nand the agency because she had insisted on formally reporting her workplace accident, \ndespite knowing the possible severe, adverse consequences:  \nOnce you are \u201cclassified\u201d, you\u2019re finished. You can\u2019t work there any more, if you have \nhad a problem, for example an accident that has been registered. Even if you changed \n[the agency] you wouldn\u2019t be able to return\u2026  \n\u2026 I\u2019ve been \u201cclassified\u201d. Because I had a work accident, and was on sick leave (Leila, \nTAW, car plant 2). \nThe \u201cduality of control\u201d (Gottfried, 1992), therefore gives rise to different layers of \ncoercion, increasing the anxieties of agency workers with regard to both immediate \nand longer term consequences of accidents, and other \u201clapses\u201d in performance. These \nexamples point to the reinforcement of the despotic element of the factory regime \nflowing from the agency contract.  \n\u201cDependable\u201d and on \u201ctrial\u201d \nThe big car manufacturers and temporary work agencies supplying the industry have a \nlong-standing and close relationship, which involves large contracts that allow for \nlower rates for user-firms. The tight relationship between these two economically \npowerful actors inevitably gives rise to an unequal relationship with the agency worker \n(Ward, 2003). The fear of being blacklisted by both agency and user firm can have a \nconsiderable influence on the behaviour of workers, from the recruitment stage with \nthe agency, to the time spent working for the user firm, through to the next assign-\nment, resulting in an \u201cextended trial period\u201d (Gilles, national SUD official).  \nManagement can be very open in what it expects from agency staff, whilst the \nrole of the temporary work agency is to supply user-firms with \u201cdependable\u201d and \u201cgood \nworkers who don\u2019t question things\u201d (Thierry, car plant 3). Being a \u201cgood worker\u201d also \nmeans having the \u201cright\u201d attitude towards unions.  \nWhen we were agency workers, we kept quiet. We didn\u2019t show our union sympathies. We \nmade out as if we didn\u2019t think about those things. And when the boss asked us to do \novertime, we said yes. Because if we said no, we could be sacked. Even in the recruitment \ninterviews, they put questions to agency workers: \u201cwhat do you think of unions, strikes?\u201d \nAt that point you couldn\u2019t say what you thought (Thierry, ex-TAW, union representative, car \nplant 3). \nA young agency worker in the north of France was not sure that he would join a un-\nion if he had a permanent contract. However, he was unambiguous in his opinion that \neven associating with unions as an agency worker was out of the question: \nIf I was permanent I might have thought about joining a union  that could have been use-\nful perhaps to defend my interests. As an agency worker, I didn\u2019t give it a moment\u2019s \nthought. I discussed with X, who is the union representative, and sometimes we shared \nthe same opinion, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell everyone in the factory that I agreed with X. \nThat you didn\u2019t do. I kept it to myself (Daniel, TAW, car plant 1). \nSo agency workers are from the very start engaging in strategies to gain access to work \nand to guarantee continued access, yet this does not necessarily mean that they are en-\n182  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \ngaging in the types of games that Burawoy (1979) described. The consent that Bura-\nwoy described in the playing out of games and \u201cmaking out\u201d takes place in a context \nin which workers have some margin of power. The context in which agency workers \nproject an image of the \u201creliably contingent\u201d worker (Peck & Theodore, 2001) is one \nin which there is no space for negotiation. The construction of this image takes place \nunder constrained circumstances where there is an imperative to \u201ckeep your head down\u201d \nand \u201cnot complain\u201d. At the same time, there is also a desire to be noticed by those who \nmight influence recruitment decisions. \nWe have to give more than the others, as agency workers. A CDI, he finishes his work, he \ngoes home, it\u2019s fine. An agency worker will try to get himself noticed, to chat to everyone, \njust in order to make himself stand out. Why? Because he hopes that if he stands out, he\u2019ll \nget a permanent contract (Daniel, TAW, car plant 1). \nThis corresponds to those studies that have found that contingent workers are likely \nto be accommodating to management\u2019s demands (Gottfried, 1992; Smith, 1998). \nHodson (1995, cited in Padavic, 2005) referred to this form of behaviour as \u201centhusi-\nastic participation\u201d; whilst Smith (1998) revealed how temporary workers will regularly \ngo beyond what is expected of them in search of a future reward.  \nFrom aspiration to disillusion \nPolicy-makers, researchers and manufacturers commonly promote agency work as a \nmechanism for facilitating the labour market integration of young workers or other \ngroups with weak labour market attachment (Booth et al., 2002). However, there was \na perception amongst interviewees that large car manufacturers were exploiting unfa-\nvourable labour market conditions in areas around the plants to access flexible and \ncheap labour. One particular source of indignation was that these nationally impor-\ntant, profitable companies were not treating all their workers in a \u201cfair way\u201d and were \nable to get away with conditions and terms of work which were likened to \u201cmodern day \nslavery\u201d (Jean-Luc, union representative, car plant 2).  Young workers at one of the \nplants, employed by the company on state-subsidised training contracts, shared a simi-\nlar sentiment. These temporary contracts were to lead to a Certificat de Qualification \nParitaires de la M\u00e9tallurgie (CPQM), a vocational qualification recognised by employers. \nBy taking on young workers on these contracts, the company receives state funds and \nthe removal of social security charges. At the time of the interviews, there were over \none hundred of these young \u201capprentices\u201d, a small group of whom where seeking ad-\nvice from the union, since they had not received any of the training specified in their \ncontract. They expressed strong disillusionment due to the perception that the com-\npany recruited them specifically to minimise labour costs. Consequently, they per-\nceived their status as similar to agency workers rather than traditional apprentices.  \nDespite bad reputations, large national car manufacturers were considered impor-\ntant companies to work for. Though agency workers were not led to believe that \nagency contracts would lead to permanent work, there was at the beginning of as-\nsignments the aspiration of a permanent contract; there was always the chance that \nyou could stand out and be taken on. However, these aspirations can be quickly \nquashed. The frequent non-renewal of contracts for large groups of agency workers \nbrought home the precarious nature of their position, whilst the reality of the work \nmanagement revue, 22(2), 169-187 DOI 10.1688\/1861-9908_mrev_2011_02_Purcell  183 \nfrequently dampened aspirations for a permanent contract. For Leila (TAW, car plant \n2), everyone knew that the company \u201chas a bad reputation, but you hope you fall on one of the \neasier jobs\u201d. When her post proved too hard, she stuck it out until her contract was not \nrenewed (due to a workplace accident), then she left with the knowledge that she did \nnot want to work in such a \u201chorrible\u201d workplace.  \nIt appears, therefore, that the ability to elicit consent via aspirations for future \nwork (Bouquin, 2006) is time-limited. Experience can dampen any self-projection of \nmotivation or loyalty to the firm. Aspirations and a sense of being empowered to in-\nfluence career paths, which may exist at the beginning of the relationship between \nagency worker, employment agency and user-firm, can be rapidly replaced by the ex-\nperience of market coercion within labour markets unfavourable to low-skilled work-\ners.   \nConclusion: How different is the agency autoworker experience?  \nWhilst the sample is small, it does have the merit of highlighting new issues that can \ninform a framework for future research. As graphically shown in earlier studies, \nagency workers form part of a disadvantaged section of the workforce in comparison \nto permanent co-workers. This is hardly revelatory, as it reinforces the claim that the \nspecificity of the agency contract alters the nature of the production regime and makes \nproblematic the central assumption of contemporary labour process theory and analy-\nsis that management need to manufacture \u2018consent\u2019 amongst employees. There is little \nevidence, in the accounts presented above, of the ideological elements of a \u2018consent\u2019 \nbased management control strategy associated with hegemonic despotism. Similarly \nthere is little correspondence between the experience of agency workers and the forms \nof individual \u201cresistance\u201d to management control or survival strategies identified in \nmuch labour process literature (Ackroyd & Thompson, 1999).   \nOn the other hand, the \u201cduality of control\u201d identified by Gottfried (1992), arising \nfrom the dual pressures of agency and user-firm, may be tempered at the beginning of \nplacements by a willingness to conform to the ideal of a \u201cgood worker\u201d, even if that \nmeans a negation of the self, as beliefs, particularly with regards to unions, are con-\ncealed. In such circumstances, any form of \u201cconsent\u201d to perform \u201cwell\u201d depends on \nthe individual\u2019s aspirations for stable (and \u201cgood\u201d quality) employment (Gottfried, \n1992; Degiuli & Kollmeyer, 2007; Bouquin, 2006). Keeping one\u2019s \u201chead down\u201d whilst \ntrying to make an impact on supervisors is a strategy which suggests a modified ver-\nsion of \u201cmaking out\u201d and \u201cplaying the game\u201d, in a context where the prize is not in-\ncremental concessions, but a stable job. However, when reality does not correspond \nto aspirations, the experience of the labour process is transformed for the agency \nworker. The market coercion dimension of the labour process becomes more promi-\nnent as disillusion and hostility to the company sets in, the outcome of which will de-\npend upon individual options for other employment. Where agency workers continue \nto conform to management demands, this will be in the context of an altered relation-\nship to the labour process, where coercion plays a larger role. Others may choose to \nturn their back upon the demands of companies and agencies, such as the agency \nworker who declared her workplace accident, in the knowledge that this would cost \nher job and the possibility of future placements. As one of the union representatives \n184  Purcell, Brook, Lucas: Between Keeping Your Head Down and Trying to Get Noticed \nexplained, \u201cleaving becomes a form of resistance\u201d when there are few resources available to \noppose management\u2019s control. \nTo what extent, therefore, is there a qualitative difference in the managerial re-\ngime experienced by agency workers and that experienced by permanent workers? \nFrom the data presented above, there appears to be no incentive for management in \ncar plants to elicit consent from their agency workforce. Are agency workers, there-\nfore, subjected to a regime of market despotism as suggested by earlier studies (Beaud \n& Pialloux, 1999) or do the conceptual insights provided by Gottfried (1992) and \nDegiuli and Kollmeyer (2007) suggest a new type of regime specific to this growing \nform of employment relationship?  \nFurther research is required to reveal the extent to which the phenomenon of \nagency work represents a qualitatively different experience of the labour process. The \ndata presented here is limited and provides only an indication of the working lives of \nagency workers. To further reveal how consent and coercion evolve over time, it will \nbe necessary to gain access to a much larger sample of agency workers, including \nthose who may just be beginning on their journey as a precarious worker in French \ncar plants. It will be also necessary to gain a wider sample of union voices. For exam-\nple, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise Democratique du Travail (CFDT) has a much more ac-\ncommodating attitude to flexibility and adheres to the concept of \u201cflexicurity\u201d as a \nway of promoting employment growth and job quality. Nevertheless, Western \nEurope\u2019s post-1945 institutions of industrial relations were built upon the assump-\ntions and practices of the workplace hegemonic regime identified by Burawoy. Thus, \nthe \u2013 dismantling and reforming of \u2013 European industrial relations in the closing dec-\nades of the last century paralleled the transition to hegemonic despotism, as unions \nstrove to adapt to the changing circumstances of intensifying global competition, pe-\nriodic economic crises and increasing political fragmentation and instability. The \ngrowth in agency work has presented a similar challenge to unions across Europe as \ntheir strategies have evolved from hostility to recognition that union renewal cannot \nbypass agency workers, particularly in their traditional strongholds, such as the auto \nindustry. Further research needs to address both the evolution of production regimes \nthrough a more detailed analysis of how agency workers consent to inferior working \nconditions and the implications of this for plant-based labour relations and union or-\nganisation. The importance of comprehending the nature of the production regime \nfor agency workers, therefore, goes beyond theoretical considerations into strategic la-\nbour movement debates on union organising, mobilization and renewal.  \nReferences \nAckroyd, S.
