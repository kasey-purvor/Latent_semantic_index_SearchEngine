Since then there has been a steady accumulation of literature on the health \nrisks and formation of DBPs and how to minimise their presence in drinking 38 \nwater. Two classes of DBPs, the trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids \n(HAAs), are considered to be the dominant DBPs on a weight basis in potable 40 \nwater (Krasner et al., 2006). It is established that many DBPs are mutagens, \ncarcinogens or toxicants (Muellner et al., 2007). Some species are regulated to 42 \nlimit their exposure to humans, for example limits set by the US Environmental \nProtection Agency are 80 \u00b5g\/L for THMs and 60 \u00b5g\/L for HAA5; while the UK 44 \nlimit for THM4 is 100 \u00b5g\/L. It is anticipated that future regulations in the UK may \nbecome more stringent and include a wider range of DBPs, including the HAAs. 46 \nNatural organic matter (NOM) acts as a precursor to DBPs. NOM is a \ncomplex and variable mix of organic compounds of biological and terrestrial 48 \norigin, with a catchment-specific composition. It is often split into hydrophobic \nand hydrophilic fractions. There is conflicting literature regarding which NOM 50 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\ntypes are predominant as precursors of THMs and HAAs. Some researchers report \nthat hydrophilic\/polar NOM is more prevalent in the formation of HAAs than 52 \nTHMs (Hwang et al., 2001), whereas others implicate hydrophobic\/non-polar \nNOM (Liang and Singer, 2003). Knowledge of the identity of DBP precursors 54 \nwould allow the selection of appropriate process\/es for their removal. As large, \nhydrophobic NOM is more amenable to removal by conventional treatments than 56 \nsmall, hydrophilic NOM (Lee et al., 2003), where the latter has a higher HAA \nformation potential (HAAFP) than the former minimising HAA concentrations 58 \nwill be more difficult. \nThe advent of DBP regulations has motivated some water utilities to 60 \nreduce chlorine doses or use alternative disinfectants in an attempt to reduce DBP \nlevels (Singer, 1999). Of the other routes for controlling DBPs, removal of 62 \nprecursors before disinfection has received most attention (Singer, 1999). For \nexample, the following reductions in HAAFP following treatment have been 64 \nreported. Coagulation: 15-78% (Singer and Bilyk, 2002); biofiltration: -11-28% \n(Toor and Mohseni, 2007); nanofiltration: 67-97% (Allgeier and Summers, 1995) 66 \nand advanced oxidation processes (AOPs): -74-74% (Chin and B\u00e9rub\u00e9, 2005; \nToor and Mohseni, 2007). Levels of removal vary widely, while biofiltration and 68 \nAOPs can actually increase HAA formation. It follows that removal of DBP \nprecursors depends on their susceptibility to different types of treatment. 70 \nWhile most treatments are selective for certain NOM groups, AOPs are \ncomparatively non-discriminatory (Crittenden et al., 2005). NOM is oxidised 72 \nthrough a complex series of reactions initiated by the hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH). \nSince \u00b7OH is a very powerful oxidant it reacts with a wide spectrum of NOM of 74 \nboth hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Rate constants for reactions between \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\u00b7OH and NOM have recently been directly measured at 1-5 x 108 M-1 s-1 76 \n(Westerhoff et al., 2007), some three to four orders of magnitude higher than for \nother oxidants (Crittenden et al., 2005).  78 \nSince the precise identity of precursors in natural waters is largely \nunknown, the use of analogues is attractive as it enables the linking of explicit 80 \nchemical and physical properties to treatability and formation of DBPs. The aim \nof this study was to compare HAA formation from nine NOM surrogates (Table 82 \n1) before and after treatment. The NOM surrogates were chosen from the NOM \ngroups listed by Crou\u00e9 et al. (2000), especially low molecular weight (MW) and 84 \nhydrophilic NOM, which it was anticipated would be representative of a post-\ncoagulation organic residual. Specifically, amino acids are important components 86 \nof algae-rich waters (Scully et al., 1985).  The surrogates have been classified as \nneutral or anionic at ambient pH based on their pKa values and hydrophobic (log 88 \nKOW>0) or hydrophilic (log KOW<0).  \nTwo AOPs were used as treatments in comparison with UV-C oxidation 90 \nand biological oxidation. The first AOP was UV\/H2O2, where hydroxyl radicals \nare formed from the photolysis of H2O2 by UV light. The second was vacuum UV 92 \n(VUV), where radiation at 185 nm is able to produce \u00b7OH directly from water \n(Thomson et al., 2004). UV-C photo-oxidation is initiated when photons are 94 \nabsorbed by NOM, leading to direct and\/or indirect photo-transformation (Corin \net al., 1996). The final treatment was biologically-active sand, where microbial 96 \ndegradation and adsorption are the principal removal mechanisms. \n-Insert Table 1- 98 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nMaterials and Methods \nRepresentative molecules (Table 1) were obtained from Fisher Scientific 100 \nand Univar\/Ajax Firechem at analytical purity or above.    \nUV-C, UV\/H2O2 and VUV experiments were undertaken in the annular 102 \nreactor detailed by Thomson et al. (2004) and Buchanan et al. (2006). The N-lamp \nused for UV-C and UV\/H2O2 experiments emitted at 254 nm, while the H-lamp 104 \nused for VUV experiments emitted at both 254 nm and 185 nm and produced \u00b7OH \nfrom direct photolysis of water, without the need for chemical addition. Average 106 \nfluence values of 12.95 mJ s-1 cm-2 for the N-lamp and 17.8 mJ s-1 cm-2 for the H-\nlamp were obtained by hydrogen peroxide and methanol actinometry (B\u00e9ltran et 108 \nal., 1995; Heit et al., 1998). \nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined with a Sievers 820 TOC 110 \nanalyser. Initial concentration of representative molecules was 7.5 mg L-1 as \ncompound. Mass extinction coefficients of 10 mg C L-1 solutions were measured 112 \nwith a Jenway 6505 spectrophotometer and Shimadzu TOC-5000 A analyser. \nFor the UV\/H2O2 experiments H2O2 was added at 68 mg L-1 (2 mM). The 114 \nconcentration of hydrogen peroxide solution was determined by potassium \npermanganate titration, with potassium oxalate used to standardise the 116 \npermanganate solution, as described by Harris (1998).  \nThe method of Joret and Levi (1986) for biodegradable dissolved organic 118 \ncarbon (BDOC) was used to assess the susceptibility of samples to biological \ntreatment. Duplicate samples were contacted with biologically-active sand for 7-120 \n10 days, with sodium acetate as a positive control to verify biological activity. \nThe sand sample came from the Yarra River, Victoria, Australia. 122 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nHAAFP of untreated and treated representative molecules was determined at the \nAustralian Water Quality Centre, Adelaide, Australia, using gas chromatography 124 \nwith electron capture detection (GC-ECD). Treated samples were prepared so \ntheir DOC was approximately half the initial value, based on existing data. For the 126 \nUV\/H2O2 samples residual hydrogen peroxide was quenched with the enzyme \ncatalase obtained from Aspergillus niger, at a dose of 60 \u00b5L L-1 (317 units L-1) 128 \nsample. The samples were shaken at 75 oscillations min-1 until visible gas \ngeneration ceased (5-6 hours). The chlorination period was 4 hours at 35\u00b0C and 7 130 \nHAAs were quantified: monobromoacetic acid, bromochloroacetic acid, \nbromodichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, 132 \ndichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA). Samples were \nquenched with ammonium chloride and quantified with USEPA method 552.  For 134 \nDCAA and TCAA, the major HAAs recorded, the limit of detection was 0.054 \u00b5g \nL-1, the limit of reporting 1 \u00b5g L-1 and the precision of the method 3.4% and 3.5% 136 \nrelative standard deviations respectively. \nThe HAAFP of oxalic acid and L-aspartic acid were measured as a follow-138 \nup study at Cranfield University, UK by GC-ECD and an adapted version of \nUSEPA Method 552.3. The chlorination period was 24 hours at 20\u00b0C\u00b12\u00b0C with a 140 \nchlorine dose 35 M\/M of compound, duplicate samples were tested and all 9 \nHAAs were quantified: as above plus dibromochloroacetic acid and 142 \ntribromoacetic acid  \n 144 \nResults \nDegradation of model compounds by the two AOPs occurred far more 146 \nrapidly than by UV-C, with nearly complete removal possible for the majority of \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\ncompounds after 50 J cm-2 irradiation (Figure 1). To illustrate mean DOC removal 148 \nfor the nine compounds after the application of 47-48 J cm-2 was 97%, 91% and \n13%, for VUV, UV\/H2O2 and UV-C respectively (Table 2). Corresponding levels 150 \nat a lower dose of 21 J cm-2 were 58%, 78% and 6% respectively, indicating that \nUV-C has limited treatment capacity and differences exist between VUV and 152 \nUV\/H2O2. The removal by UV\/H2O2 compares well with Goslan et al. (2006), \nwho reported DOC reduction of 78% for a reservoir water at a similar UV-C dose 154 \nand identical H2O2 dose (UV-C 22 J cm-2, H2O2 2 mM). The UV-C data are \nconsistent with Thomson et al. (2002), who reported a DOC reduction of 16% for 156 \na raw water at  UV-C fluence of 26 J cm-2, thus underlining the similar treatability \nof the surrogates compared with a natural water. Overall these results illustrate the 158 \ntwo AOPs were approximately 8 times more effective than UV-C at removing \nthese compounds at a fluence of 47-48 J cm-2. Buchanan et al. (2004) previously 160 \nfound VUV to be approximately 6 times more effective than UV-C in treating a \nraw water. 162 \n-Insert Figure 1- \n-Insert Table 2- 164 \n \nRemoval by UV-C was linked to hydrophobicity. Tannic acid and 166 \nresorcinol were the most treatable compounds, with DOC removals of 95\u00b15% and \n98\u00b15% respectively after a dose of 186 J cm-2 (0.52 kWhm-2), compared with 168 \nremovals of 24-59\u00b15% for the other molecules (Table 2). This can be explained \nby the higher mass extinction coefficients of resorcinol and tannic acid: 0.006 and 170 \n0.045 cm-1 L mg C-1 respectively, compared with the other molecules, all 0.000 \ncm-1 L mg C-1. It is interesting that those compounds with very limited capacity 172 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nfor UV-C absorption were still removed to a moderate,extent, albeit at high UV-C \ndoses. UV photo-oxidation can proceed from direct photo-transformation or 174 \nindirect photo-transformation, where activated NOM can transfer energy to form \nexcited photo-reactants such as oxygen, which in turn can react with NOM (Corin 176 \net al., 1996). This indicates even the hydrophilic compounds were able to absorb \nenough energy to initiate these types of reactions. 178 \nThe biodegradability of  samples as measured by removal by biologically-\nactive sand in the BDOC test was grouped according to organic type, with the 180 \namino acids demonstrating high DOC reductions of 80-91% contrasting with 23-\n56% for the other samples (Figure 2, Table 2). Similarly high removal of amino 182 \nacids by biological activated carbon (BAC) has previously been reported by \nJadas-H\u00e9cart (1989), with an average removal of 70%. Supporting this view 184 \nHwang et al. (2001) stated biodegradation is effective for removing non UV-\nabsorbing low molecular weight acids. Given this information the aromatic 186 \ncharacter of tannic acid and resorcinol may explain their lower biodegradability; \nhowever the explanation for the two carbohydrates is less obvious. Charge does 188 \nnot seem to be a factor, since of the amino acids L-glutamic and L-aspartic acids \nwere charged under ambient pH conditions (Table 2), instead  differing chemical 190 \nfunctionality is a more likely reason. Nor does size correlate with \nbiodegradability. It has been stated that small compounds are expected to be more 192 \nbiodegradable as they are more easily transported across the cell membrane \n(Leisinger, 1981), however in this study there was no such relationship, even for 194 \ncompounds of the same chemical type (Table 2).  \nFor the two AOPs there was no direct link between hydrophobicity and 196 \nremoval, which accords with Crittenden et al. (2005) who reported AOPs were \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nnon-selective processes for removing a range of organic compounds. To illustrate, 198 \nalthough the hydrophilic compound glycine was the slowest compound to \ndegrade, as quantified by pseudo first-order rate constants, the hydrophobic tannic 200 \nacid was also initially slow to be mineralised (0-11 J cm-2), as evidenced by the \nconvex shapes of its VUV degradation plot (Figure 1b and Table 2). It is possible 202 \nthe initially slow degradation of tannic acid by UV-C and VUV can be explained \nby its larger size, which means multiple reactions were necessary before 204 \nmineralisation was attained.  \nAfter 48 J cm-2 of VUV irradiation, all compounds except for glycine and 206 \nL-leucine, which both recorded DOC reduction of 88\u00b15%, were degraded by over \n90%. For the UV\/H2O2 system three compounds had a DOC reduction of under 208 \n90% after 47 J cm-2 irradiation: L-aspartic acid in addition to L-leucine and \nglycine, the latter with the lowest removal of 55\u00b15%. Kinetic analysis of the 210 \nremoval data revealed similar trends. Glycine was the slowest compound to \ndegrade by VUV, with an initial pseudo first-order rate constant 0.043 J-1 cm-2; 212 \ncompared with 0.044-0.116 J-1 cm-2 for the other compounds, and also by \nUV\/H2O2: rate constants of 0.016 J-1 cm-2, compared with 0.045-0.14 J-1 cm-2 214 \nrespectively. The degradation of amino acids by AOPs has previously been \nstudied in some detail by Le Lacheur and Glaze (1996) who reported glycine to be 216 \nless reactive than the other amino acids, as shown by its lower rate constant for \nthe reaction with the hydroxyl radical of ~ 107 M-1 s-1 compared with serine at 3.2 218 \nx 108 M-1 s-1. The first step in these reactions is H-abstraction alpha to the amino \ngroup, while reactivity is explained in terms of the stability of the radical 220 \nintermediate thus formed. With the exception of glycine which forms a less stable \nsecondary radical, the other amino acids studied all form tertiary radicals. After 222 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n186 J cm-2 of UV-C exposure it was again glycine and L-leucine which were the \nmost recalcitrant, with removals of 24\u00b15% and 31\u00b15% respectively. The similar 224 \nranking for the amino acid kinetic constants across the three UV-based systems, \nwith glycine always the slowest to degrade, implies there may be common 226 \nmechanistic pathways between UV-C and the AOPs, i.e., that the same or similar \nintermediates were formed. Since degradation by UV-C relies upon absorption of 228 \nphotons rather than reaction with \u00b7OH, as is the case for AOPs, this is an \ninteresting observation. Alternatively it may be that the slower degradation of 230 \nglycine by UV-C was a result of its smaller size (Table 1). \nTannic acid was the only compound to have significantly high HAAFP at 232 \n155 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, with aspartic acid and resorcinol the next highest at 21 and 14 \n\u00b5g mgDOC-1 respectively (Figure 3). In contrast, HAAFP of all other compounds 234 \nwas 0-1 \u00b5g mgDOC-1. Resorcinol and tannic acid contain activated aromatic \nfunctionalities which react strongly with chlorine and can produce THM and 236 \nHAAs (Singer, 1999). \n 238 \n-Insert Figure 3- \n 240 \nReckhow and Kim (2008) found L-aspartic acid to be one of a small \nnumber of amino acids to produce high DBP levels, with DCAA formation of 387 242 \n\u00b5g mgDOC-1. To investigate whether differences in chlorination time, between 4 \nh in this study and 48 h (Reckhow and Kim, 2008), could account for this 244 \ndiscrepancy in HAA formation we measured the HAAs formed from L-aspartic \nacid after 1, 4 and 24 h chlorination. The respective values were 100\u00b168, 82\u00b12 246 \nand 671\u00b130 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, thus appearing to confirm that longer chlorination \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nperiods are necessary for L-aspartic acid to achieve maximum HAA formation. 248 \nThe high  DCAA formation of L-aspartic acid was explained by Hureiki et al. \n(1994), who proposed a mechanism where 3-oxopropanoic acid is the main 250 \nintermediate resulting from chlorination. In turn 3-oxopropanoic acid is a \u03b2-keto \nacid structure similar to those reported as being high DBP formers by Dickenson 252 \net al. (2008). The latter study proposes \u03b2-keto acid structures as possible slow-\nreacting DCAA precursors, where DCAA formation after 5 minutes is low 254 \nrelative to that after 24 h. Since it is likely DCAA formation from L-aspartic acid \nwill be slower still due to the extra steps required to form the \u03b2-keto acid 256 \nintermediate, this supports the idea that higher DCAA yields require longer \nchlorination times. 258 \nThe HAAFP of the hydrophilic compounds increases after treatment, \nespecially by the UV based systems. Partial biodegradation increased the HAAFP 260 \nof most of the representative molecules, although the increases were generally \nmore modest. L-glutamic acid illustrates this most strikingly, from an untreated 262 \nvalue of 1 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 (Figure 3) the HAAFP rises by 5, 50, 52 and 36 \u00b5g \nmgDOC-1 after biotreatment, UV-C VUV and UV\/H2O2 respectively (Figure 4). 264 \nThus the UV-based systems all caused a sharp increase in HAAFP. This shift to \nenhanced HAA levels post-treatment has  literature precedent .  In their study 266 \nusing UV-H2O2 and\/or biological activated carbon (BAC) to treat a raw surface \nwater, Toor and Mohseni (2007) found the AOP could increase DCAA formation 268 \npotential (DCAAFP). UV\/H2O2 treatment at UV fluence of 3000 mJ cm-2 and \nH2O2 concentration of 10-20 mg L-1 gave reductions in TCAA formation potential 270 \n(TCAAFP) of 69% and THMFP of 73%, but DCAAFP increased by 74%. Note \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nthat all values were reported in \u00b5g L-1 rather than \u00b5g mgDOC-1. BAC alone did 272 \nnot provide significant reduction in DCAAFP, TCAAFP or THMFP. \n-Insert Figure 4- 274 \n \nFor the two hydrophobic compounds the pattern was somewhat different 276 \ncompared with the hydrophilic compounds (Figures 3 and 4). Treatment of tannic \nacid  caused its HAAFP to decrease from an untreated value of 155 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 278 \n(Figure 3) by 7, 69, 101 and 110 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 after biotreatment, UV-C VUV and \nUV\/H2O2, respectively (Figure 4). Thus for tannic acid AOPs caused the greatest 280 \nfall in HAAFP. Resorcinol has an untreated HAAFP of 14 \u00b5g  mgDOC-1 (Figure \n3) which changes by 28, 81, 20 and -1 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 following biotreatment, UV-282 \nC VUV and UV\/H2O2 respectively (Figure 4). Thus for resorcinol UV-C effected \nthe greatest increase in HAAFP.  284 \nIt has been established that DCAA and  TCAA,, which were the dominant \nHAAs in this study, have disjunct formation mechanisms (Reckhow and Singer, 286 \n1986). Therefore it is interesting to observe the differing effects that treatment had \non formation of the two species. For the hydrophilic species DCAA was  largely 288 \nresponsible for the increase in HAAs after treatment. This was exemplified by L-\nglutamic acid (Figure 5). From an initial value of 1 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 DCAA rose to 3, 290 \n37, 20 and 29 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 following treatment  by biodegradation, VUV, \nUV\/H2O2 and UV-C, respectively. Again the behaviour of the hydrophobic 292 \nmolecules differs from that of the hydrophilics. For resorcinol TCAA was  most \ncommon before treatment: total HAAs 14 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, TCAA 10 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 294 \nand this dominance was maintained in the biotreated sample: total HAAs 42 \u00b5g \nmgDOC-1, TCAA 33 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 and UV-C treated sample: total HAAs 95 \u00b5g 296 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nmgDOC-1, TCAA 56 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, while in the VUV and UV\/H2O2 treated \nsamples DCAA was dominant: total HAAs 39 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, DCAA 16 \u00b5g 298 \nmgDOC-1 and total HAAs 13 \u00b5g mgDOC-1, DCAA 7 \u00b5g mgDOC-1 respectively. \nFor tannic acid DCAA was the commonest species in the untreated sample with 300 \nsignificant amounts of DCAA and TCAA in all treated samples.  \n 302 \n-Insert Figure 5- \nDiscussion 304 \nA notable aspect of the results was the increase in HAAFP of the \nrepresentative molecules following partial biological and chemical oxidation. In 306 \nparticular the untreated hydrophilic representative molecules did not form \nsignificant amounts of any HAAs, however AOP treatment increased their 308 \nDCAAFP. This trend was most marked for two amino acids: L-glutamic acid and \nL-leucine. Since DCAA was the most problematic HAA species, effort is required 310 \nto further elucidate the identity of DCAA precursors and confirm them as AOP \nproducts or intermediates. Meanwhile resorcinol, a known reactive THM 312 \nprecursor (Singer, 1999), behaved differently from the hydrophilic compounds by \nforming predominantly TCAA, both when untreated and after UV-C irradiation 314 \n(Figure 5). There is a support for such a distinction in natural water studies:  Liang \nand Singer (2003) also found DCAA precursors to be less hydrophobic than 316 \nTCAA precursors. Mechanistic studies have linked a rise in levels of DCAA to \ndiketone and then aldehyde formation after oxidation (Reckhow and Singer, 318 \n1986). Conversely, and in agreement with the resorcinol data, TCAA formation \nhas been likened to THM formation and may proceed through common 320 \nintermediates (Reckhow et al., 1990). This information all points towards the idea \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nthat post-coagulation\/hydrophilic waters can have the potential to form high levels 322 \nof DCAA.  \nModel compounds with a known high DCAA formation are \u03b2-dicarbonyl 324 \nacid species (Dickenson et al., 2008) and a small number of amino acids, notably \naspartic acid and asparagine (Reckhow and Kim, 2008), both of which are  326 \nprobably oxidised to a \u03b2-dicarbonyl acid species (Hureiki et al., 1994, Dickenson \net al., 2008). Since both mechanistic studies and model compound work suggest 328 \n\u03b2-dicarbonyl acid structures are important in DCAA formation, it is tempting to \nimplicate their formation through oxidation in the raised DCAA levels recorded.   330 \nSmall acidic compounds are those most commonly identified as oxidation \nproducts of NOM. A range of products including mono and dibasic acids and keto 332 \nacids were semi-quantitatively identified by Corin et al. (1996) following UV \nirradiation of reference humic and fulvic acids and a surface water. Amongst these 334 \nwere \u03b2-dicarbonyl acids, including 3-hydroxypropanoic and 3-oxobutanoic acids, \nas well as other dicarbonyl acids of unspecified isomer. The reactions of the 336 \nhydroxyl radical with glycine (Berger et al., 1999) and serine (Le Lacheur and \nGlaze, 1996) have been previously studied. Both propose a reaction scheme where 338 \nthe initial step is hydrogen abstraction alpha to the amine group. For serine this \nyields mixed functional keto acids retaining the amino acid backbone, such as 340 \nketomalonic acid, 3-hydroxyoxopropanoic acid and dioxopropanoic acid. \nHowever, while these three-carbon species contain the \u03b2-keto acid moiety they 342 \nalso have a carbonyl group in the alpha position, and thus no hydrogen available \nfor chlorine substitution as necessary in the mechanism of Reckhow and Singer 344 \n(1986). For glycine, which has a backbone of only two carbons, formation of \u03b2-\nketo acid species is not possible by this scheme. The observation that glycine only 346 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexperienced minimal HAAFP increases after AOP treatment (Figure 3) supports \nthe idea that \u03b2-keto acids are important. For serine the non-specific nature of 348 \nradical reactions means three-carbon intermediates are unlikely to accumulate, \nwhile smaller and more inert products such as oxalic acid may do so (Le Lacheur 350 \nand Glaze, 1996). Oxalic acid was also tentatively identified as the major product \nof the glycine reaction scheme. To determine whether oxalic acid might be 352 \nresponsible for the enhanced HAAFP we measured its HAAFP and found it to be \n0 \u00b5g mg DOC-1. Thus oxalic acid was not responsible for the enhanced HAAFP 354 \nreported here. More generally simple monobasic acids cited as oxidation products \nof NOM do not contain functionalities thought to be reactive DBP precursors 356 \n(Singer, 1999), which also indicates the involvement of other compounds. To \nsummarise, while \u03b2-dicarbonyl acid species have been identified as UV products 358 \nin natural waters, their occurrence as AOP products has still to be confirmed. \nThus further work is needed to establish which compounds are key for enhanced 360 \nDCAA formation and whether \u03b2-dicarbonyl acid species are involved.  \nIn water where hydrophilic species contain a significant HAA generating 362 \ncapacity additional treatment may be key to controlling final HAA formation. The \nsuccessful implementation of any treatment would depend on the specific 364 \ncomposition of NOM present, and not solely on the reactive DBP precursors. \nSince AOPs were found to be capable of degrading both hydrophilic and 366 \nhydrophobic surrogates, this makes them an attractive option for treatment of the \npost-coagulation residual, which is largely hydrophilic (Sharp et al., 2006).  368 \nHowever, based on these results AOPs carry the risk of increased HAAs, which \nwould need to be investigated in the relevant water under varying AOP doses. It 370 \ncan be inferred this risk will be greater in waters with high concentration of \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nhydrophilic species and especially amino acids. Such waters may well have a high 372 \nproportion of algal organic matter (AOM)  and\/or a wastewater influence.  Algae \nare known as an important source of amino acids, and it has been recorded that the 374 \nprotein concentration of different lake waters rose from an average of 0.1-1 mg L-\n1 during an algal bloom (Scully et al., 1985). Caution is advised in such cases. 376 \nUsing AOPs in combination with biotreatment may reduce the risk of increased \nDCAA. Toor and Mohseni (2007), reported a DCAAFP reduction of 63% from 378 \ncombined UV\/H2O2 and BAC treatment, contrasting with an increase of 74% for \nUV\/H2O2 alone. Such a combination is analogous to the combination of ozone-380 \nbiological activated carbon, where ozone is used to generate a higher proportion \nof biodegradable material for removal by the BAC.  382 \nIn hydrophilic-rich waters biotreatment alone is also a viable process \noption and has been found to be effective for amino acid removal. Since increases 384 \nin HAAFP of biologically treated samples were generally less than those caused \nby UV based oxidation, the risk of raised HAA levels in natural waters is less. 386 \nHowever the biologically available DOC content of untreated natural waters is \ntypically only around 15% (Tranvik, 1998: Buchanan et al., 2004), while amino 388 \nacids only comprise up to 5% of the DOC of raw surface waters (Thurman, 1985). \nTherefore biotreatment is only likely to reduce DBP formation in cases where 390 \nhighly reactive precursors belong to a readily biodegradable group such as the \namino acids and\/or pre-treatment has increased the bioavailable content.  392 \nThe necessity of a high energy input makes UV-C treatment inefficient \nand expensive for DOC removal at a larger scale. This is especially true where 394 \nNOM has a low UV-absorbing capacity, as the hydrophilic compounds studied \nhere. Typical UV disinfection practice is 40 mJ cm-2 (Thomson et al., 2002) so the 396 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nmaximum mineralisation observed here (at 186 J cm-2) would not occur during \nmicrobial disinfection. Interestingly, these results indicate that exposure of natural 398 \nwater to sunlight (and UV-C), which can involve high energy levels, has the \npotential to alter the composition of DBP precursors. For example UV-C 400 \nirradiation of resorcinol can increase levels of TCAA. This idea is given credence \nby Chow et al., (2008), who studied the impact of simulated sunlight on DBPs. 402 \nIrradiation of raw waters for 1403 and 5612 J cm-2 at 300-800 nm were equivalent \nto 1 and 4 days of clear summer weather respectively. Under these conditions 404 \nHAAFP decreased by up to 50%. \n 406 \nConclusions \n1. AOP treatment of L-glutamic acid and L-leucine leads to dramatically 408 \nincreased amounts of HAAs, specifically DCAA \n2. Biological treatment is particularly effective at removing amino acids but 410 \ncan also increase HAA formation of hydrophilic compounds \n3. UV-C irradiation also has the potential to increase the HAAFP of NOM 412 \nsurrogates \n4. Investigation is recommended before AOPs are implemented for HAA 414 \ncontrol in waters with relatively high amino acid concentrations \n 416 \nAcknowledgements \nAnglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Severn Trent Water, United Utilities and 418 \nYorkshire Water are all gratefully acknowledged for their financial support of this \nproject. 420 \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nReferences 422 \n Allgeier, S.C. and Summers, R.S.
