The essay seeks to disclaim two interrelated faults ascribed to \nSpielberg: a characteristic supplanting of narrative coherence by spectacle; and an \nindifference to subtlety and sophistication. \n \nKeywords: Spielberg; organic unity; storytelling; narration; film style \n \nFew films in Steven Spielberg\u201fs oeuvre are as enigmatic, troublesome, and \ntaxonomically slippery as Always (1989). The film uneasily straddles the twin \nflagpoles of Spielberg\u201fs output, refusing easy alignment with both the popular event \nmovie (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds) and the prestige \npicture (The Color Purple, Schindler\u2019s List, Saving Private Ryan). Moreover, Always \nconstitutes one of Spielberg\u201fs few critical and commercial failures. I explore the \nprincipal critical grievances below. Commercially, the film\u201fs box office gross fell \nconsiderably short of the Spielberg benchmark, amassing a modest $77.1 million \nworldwide (Freer 2001, 181).\n1\n The failure of Always has prompted some critics to \nreflect on the precise nature of its shortcomings. Nigel Morris has deftly shown that \n 3 \nthe film\u201fs commercial prospects were hampered by an ambiguous and confusing \nmarketing campaign (Morris 2007, 161-2). One critical refrain posits casting errors as \na central flaw (Maslin 1989; Travers 1990; McCabe 1999). My broad concern in this \nessay is to explore how far the failure of Always can be attributed not to extrafilmic \nfactors but to the constructional form and style of the film itself. Is the film \u2013 to \nborrow a phrase from Warren Buckland\u201fs study on Spielberg \u2013 a \u201ewell-told story\u201f? Is \nits failure traceable to some problematic compositional devices or effects?  \n I begin by limning the key premises upon which Always has been attacked. \nSome of the imputed misdemeanours with which Spielberg is charged are, we shall \nsee, defensible in terms of the canonic principles of storytelling. Mounted on this \ndefense is an attempt to demonstrate that Always withstands broad organicist scrutiny. \nI argue that Spielberg\u201fs film makes the organic fusion of narrative, style, and form a \nprivileged aesthetic principle. This argument is underpinned by a confutation of two \nfallacies consistently applied to Spielberg: first, that the filmmaker\u201fs work \nsubordinates narrative coherence to the corrosive demands of spectacle; and second, \nthat the corollary emphasis on attractions forecloses the possibility of ambiguity, \ncomplexity, and nuance. Lastly I identify ostensibly problematic aspects at the \ninternal level of Always. While certain of these aspects are recoverable as instances of \nfairly adventurous storytelling, others remain problematic if subjected to too rigid an \norganicist criterion. In any case, these troublesome internal elements are not \nsufficiently injurious to account for the film\u201fs disappointing reception. More broadly, \nthe essay\u201fs overarching contention echoes a verdict summarised succinctly by Morris: \n\u201eAlways\u2026is more interesting, complex and sophisticated, but also problematic, than \nmost reviews suggest\u201f (Morris 2007, 160). It is a film, in short, that warrants detailed \ncritical reappraisal.  \n It will be useful at this point to rehearse the film\u201fs plot. A remake of Victor \nFleming\u201fs World War II drama A Guy Named Joe (1943), Always is focalised around \nPete (Richard Dreyfuss), an aerial firefighter killed while rescuing his colleague Al \n(John Goodman) from a forest fire. Before he can proceed to Heaven, Pete must fulfil \ntwo cosmically decreed tasks: he must mentor an aspiring young pilot named Ted \n(Brad Johnson), and bring closure to his own romantic relationship with Dorinda \n(Holly Hunter). Pete\u201fs tasks are complicated by the fact that death has divested him of \ncorporeal materiality; now only the fellow deceased can see and hear him. By the \n 4 \nfilm\u201fs denouement, Pete comes to accept both Dorinda\u201fs ability to live without him \nand her burgeoning romance with Ted. \n \nCritical reproaches  \nMuch of the negative critical reaction to Always has centred upon Spielberg\u201fs decision \nto shear away his source material\u201fs World War II setting. Typifying a prevalent \nbroadside, Peter Travers argues: \n Spielberg makes several miscalculations, none more calamitous than updating \n the story for the Eighties. The screenplay\u2026removes the wartime setting and \n substitutes pilots battling forest fires for daredevils in combat. [A Guy Named \n Joe] spoke to a nation\u201fs sorrow; Always lacks a similar sense of scope or \n urgency. (Travers 1990) \nSimilarly Joseph McBride asserts that \u201eSpielberg\u201fs decision to transpose the story to \nthe present day\u2026robbed [the film] of the social context that had made its self-\nsacrificial fantasy acceptable and meaningful in 1943\u201f (McBride 1997: 407). In \nSpielberg\u201fs hands, Pete is a deheroicised incarnation of Spencer Tracy\u201fs courageous \nwar pilot in A Guy Named Joe. If Tracy\u201fs intrepid actions signify the courageousness \nof a soldier at war, Spielberg\u201fs protagonist puts his life at risk for no comparably \nworthwhile cause. Expunging the World War II context deprives Always of social \nsignificance and its male protagonist of heroic stature.  \n This reproach is not necessarily wrongheaded but it does obscure other \nnarrative effects. Spielberg\u201fs decision to discard the war-torn locale enables him to \nintensify the focus on the human drama: Always furnishes characters that are of \ncentral interest in their own right, not merely in relation to a wartime context. \nSpielberg\u201fs abdication of a wartime setting may result in a lack of contemporary \nsocial resonance, but it gives fulcrum to the narrative in other ways \u2013 serving, most \nexplicitly, to sharpen a character trait: Pete\u201fs recklessness. Spielberg can bring Pete\u201fs \ninherent irresponsibility into sharp focus by abandoning the wartime milieu. What \nSpielberg sacrifices in social resonance, then, he gains in terms of character \ndelineation. Moreover, this well-marked character trait is a wellspring of important \nnarrative effects, working upon character relationships (e.g. eliciting the disapproval \nof Dorinda and Al) and ratcheting up narrative suspense (we expect a tragic event to \nspring from Pete\u201fs strongly signposted recklessness). Shedding the World War II \nframework thus allows Spielberg to spotlight storytelling elements other than social \n 5 \ncommentary: psychological traits are crystallised which in turn pushes suspense to a \nhigher pitch of emphasis.  \n Another widely-expressed charge against the film may be contested. Several \nof the film\u201fs detractors complain that it relies prosaically on \u201ehackneyed\u201f and \nanachronistic dialogue. Phrases such as \u201eYou big lug\u201f and \u201eThat\u201fs my girl, pal\u201f \nevidently proved nettlesome for some reviewers. Several critics dismiss the film\u201fs use \nof period slang as a clumsy superimposition of 40s-style dialogue over contemporary \nidioms and argot. But to dismiss the obsolete dialogue as hackneyed and trite is to \nignore its fulfilment of certain variegated tasks. Always self-consciously memorialises \nan earlier era of filmmaking, not least in its respectful reworking of Victor Fleming\u201fs \nA Guy Named Joe. Hence Spielberg steeps his film in the iconography of the forties\u201f \nWorld War II drama: aviator uniforms, World War II airplanes, uniformed figures \nstranded amid blazing vegetation and so forth. Anachronistic dialogue of the sort that \ncritics find troubling is simply one more allusive device in Spielberg\u201fs wider program \nof memorialisation.  \n A second problem with criticising the film\u201fs archaic dialogue is that the critic \ndownplays the temporal ambiguity that characterises the film as a whole. In Always \nnarrative time is explicitly disarrayed. Thus Pete believes he\u201fs been dead for a matter \nof minutes, but de facto six months have passed; the film is set in the contemporary \n80s, but the characters invoke predominantly anachronistic cultural references (John \nWayne, James Cagney, James Stewart, Henry Fonda). Always evinces a studied \ntemporal slipperiness, as Spielberg indicates when he speaks of his desire to create  \n \u2026a timeless feeling. It\u201fs a contemporary movie. It feels like it\u201fs set in the \n forties, but in fact it is set today. (Quoted in Brode 1995, 190)  \nOverall, time in Always becomes labile and unfixed, as if Spielberg is overlapping and \ndissolving the boundaries between distinct decades. Against this background of \ntemporal ambiguity, anachronistic speech should not properly strike us as obtrusive \nand vaguely justified; on the contrary, it is conceptually integrated within a thematic \nof temporal displacement.  \n Lastly, portions of the film\u201fs antiquated dialogue are assigned motivic purpose. \nOne reviewer laments the inclusion of \u201eflip\u201f lines like \u201eThat\u201fs my girl, pal!\u201f (Ebert \n1989). But to complain about this line of dialogue in particular is to overlook its \nfunction as an important motivic element in the film. Here Spielberg takes a standard \nfilmic device \u2013 the recurring verbal motif \u2013 and demonstrates its capacity for range \n 6 \nand flexibility. Over the course of the film, Spielberg spins minor variations on the \nphrase. When Pete encounters Dorinda shortly after his death, he whispers to her \naffectionately: \u201eThat\u201fs my girl.\u201f Yet despite Pete\u201fs putatively affectionate tone, the \nviewer is encouraged to detect an undercurrent of possessiveness \u2013 Pete, we infer, is \nretentively laying claim to Dorinda\u201fs romantic affections. Spielberg corroborates this \ninference when Pete remarks, \u201eDon\u201ft forget, you\u201fre still my girl.\u201f What begins as a \ndeclaration of affection transmutes into a proprietorial statement (\u201eThat\u201fs my girl\u201f). \nThe motif assumes its more threatening permutation when Ted emerges as a \nlegitimate rival for Dorinda\u201fs romantic desires: now Pete growls, \u201eThat\u201fs my girl, \npal!\u201f  \n Rather than merely reviving old-fashioned movie talk, Spielberg deftly yokes \nthis motif to character goals and action. Pete must learn to relinquish his hold on \nDorinda; he must come to accept that Dorinda is no longer his girl. Once established, \nthe motivic phrase performs varied repetitions, enabling us to track Pete\u201fs changing \nattitudes as he develops greater self-knowledge. By the closing scene, Pete can intone \nthe phrase \u201eThat\u201fs my girl\u201f with unadulterated pride and affection: his negative traits \nof possessiveness and jealousy have finally been vanquished.  \n We might be sympathetic to the critics\u201f contention that the timeworn dialogue \nin Always seems oddly juxtaposed against the film\u201fs modern setting. The datedness of \nthe dialogue ironically undermines Spielberg\u201fs intention to create a \u201etimeless\u201f \natmosphere. Yet we should qualify these criticisms by acknowledging that Spielberg \nprovides internal and external justification for the dialogue\u201fs deployment. Ostensibly \nhoary phrases perform crucial motivic functions; they undergo minor rephrasings to \nindicate character change; and they assimilate into Spielberg\u201fs large-scale \nmemorialisation of a past era of film history. Far from a mere recycling of movie \nclich\u00e9s, Always anchors its evocative dialogue to the concerns of plot, theme, and \nauthorial commentary. Moreover, the motivic arrangement of \u201ehackneyed\u201f phrases is \none means by which the film unifies itself \u2013 and in this regard, as we shall see, \nSpielberg\u201fs verbal motif epitomizes a more general robustness of narrative integrity \nand coherence.  \n \nA well-told story: Spielberg\u2019s organicist aesthetic \nIn Directed By Steven Spielberg, Warren Buckland convincingly demonstrates that \nsuch films as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Jurassic Park (1993) and Minority \n 7 \nReport (2002) are skilfully crafted artworks exhibiting subtlety and sophistication. \nMore specifically, Buckland shows Spielberg\u201fs blockbusters to manifest organic unity, \nthe harmonious and irreducible integration of story and style. As Buckland states, \u201ean \norganic unity is a whole that is more than the sum of its parts, for the whole possesses \nan added value not contained in any of its parts\u201f (Buckland 2006, 31). The parts of the \nartwork are coalesced into a perfect synthesis. It is inconceivable that an organically \nunified sequence will function as effectively without one of its constituent elements, \nbecause \u201ethe parts [have reached] their highest degree or best possible level of \nintegration\u201f (Ibid.). Organic unity, Buckland suggests, is a rudimentary feature of the \n\u201ewell-told story.\u201f Style, story, and narrative form achieve a strong interdependency \n(an organic unity) in the well-made film, with significance resonating across each of \nthese interpenetrating levels.\n2\n  \n Buckland\u201fs insistence on Spielberg\u201fs organicity radically butts against the \npostmodern conception of high-concept cinema as piecemeal, fragmented, and \n\u201epurposefully incoherent\u201f (Schatz 1993, 34).3 This critical tradition situates Spielberg \nas the exemplar of spectacle-driven cinema, distinguished by a devaluation of \nnarrative unity (e.g. Dixon 2001). My analysis of Always will serve as a kind of \nnegative instance, for even Spielberg\u201fs critical and box-office failures can be shown \nto exemplify, to a large degree, classical norms of coherence and unity. A contiguous \naccusation pitted against Spielberg (and the blockbuster ethos in general) is \ncapsulized by one review of Always. Janet Maslin mounts her critique of the film on a \ntireless assumption: Spielberg, we often hear, sacrifices subtlety and nuance on the \naltar of excess, bombast, and handholding redundancy. Of Always, Maslin writes: \n\u201eGentle and moving as it means to be, there\u201fs barely a scene that wouldn\u201ft have \nworked better with less fanfare\u201f (quoted in Freer 2001, 189).4 In what follows, I aim \nto demonstrate that such assumptions scarcely do justice to a filmmaker whose \nflaunting of spectacle belies a discreet and intricately patterned synthesis of style, \ntheme, and narrative form.  \n Indeed, what the foregoing section has sought to indicate is that Always \ndisplays the organicity of characterisation and structure that is ingredient to a well-\nmade narrative. Narrative causality and long-range motifs function to unify the film. \nCharacter traits are sharply delineated (as in the case of Pete\u201fs well-marked \nrecklessness). Even the film\u201fs overt use of coincidence \u2013 a much maligned device for \nmotivating story events \u2013 can be justified at a diegetic level. One coincidence in \n 8 \nparticular is especially flagrant: at the airbase, Ted pursues a runaway vehicle which, \nafter tracing a mazy trajectory, ploughs into Dorinda\u201fs rented house \u2013 a deus ex \nmachina that improbably causes the paths of the eventual romantic couple to intersect. \nYet such brazenly acausal events find diegetic justification in the film\u201fs \nnarrativisation of fate and the hereafter: apparently random encounters are to be \nreconfigured as the purposeful manoeuvrings of destiny.  \n As a value of artistic excellence, organic unity mandates that the synthesis of \n\u201eform and content is natural and perfect\u201f (M\u00fcnsterberg 1970, 82).5 Accordingly, \nAlways organically unifies plot and character with stylistic techniques. At the level of \npictorial style, the film displays Spielberg\u201fs characteristic visual ingenuity. After Pete \nis killed partway through the story, Spielberg and screenwriter Jerry Belson employ \nvarious narrative tactics to foreground affinities between Pete and Ted. This explicit \ncomparison is dramatically motivated: Pete\u201fs tragic death has endowed him with \ncelestial powers; now he is able to channel his own thoughts and mannerisms through \nTed. Consequently the two characters are made to intone identical stretches of \ndialogue, perform rhyming gestures, and articulate common desires. Spielberg also \nfinds visual ways to hint at the characters\u201f similarities, although strikingly he puts \nthese strategies on display well in advance of both Pete\u201fs demise and subsequent \nmentoring of Ted.  \n An early sequence in Always yields a couple of exemplary instances. In the \nairbase barroom, Pete and Dorinda dance together to a (predictably anachronistic) \nromance ballad. They stray into the path of Ted, aligning for the first time the spatio-\ntemporal paths of the two male characters. A medium shot places us behind Ted as he \nfaces the couple dancing in the mid-ground; Pete is similarly turned away from \ncamera, while Dorinda, in Pete\u201fs arms, is framed frontally. Spielberg visually alludes \nto affinities between the two men by synchronising their movements. As Pete turns \nhis head to follow Dorinda\u201fs gaze, so Ted turns his head toward the camera. A reverse \nshot switches their positions in the frame, making them pictorially parallel and hinting \nat their similarities. Long before the two characters are brought into an explicit \ncomparison, Spielberg exploits standard resources of figure movement and framing to \ntacitly foreshadow their subsequent interchangeability.  \n Anticipating character relationships in this way not only augurs the echoic \nbehaviour that becomes so pronounced later in the film; more generally, it helps knit \ntogether distinct phases of story action, so that a generally tight cause-and-effect \n 9 \nnarrative is supplied still greater cohesion by a web of visual motifs, echoic gestures, \nand parallel actions. This is one mark of a well-told story: significant actions are \ndiscreetly anticipated by bits of foreshadowing which, in turn, lend coherence and \nunity to the overall architecture of the film. So much, then, for postclassical \n\u201eincoherence.\u201f Moreover, visual narration \u2013 such as the manipulation of figure \nmovement at work here \u2013 is assigned clear storytelling tasks, in this instance \nrehearsing character affinities not yet acknowledged in dialogue. \n  Other plot elements find imagistic expression. In the scenes preceding Pete\u201fs \ndemise, Spielberg furnishes visual images that announce self-consciously that the \nprotagonist is marked for death. As Dorinda warns Pete that his \u201etime is up,\u201f an open \nrefrigerator door issues diffuse blue light to lend Pete a spectral hue. Spielberg also \nhints at impending narrative action in more subtle ways. One portentous composition \nin the barroom sequence provides an instance. A densely populated long shot shows \nDorinda in a white dress, dancing near the center of the frame; to her right stands Ted; \nand Pete, overlooking the action from a flight of stairs, is positioned high in the left \ncorner of the frame. Pete\u201fs oblique position in the image sets up a pictorial tension, \nhis elevated position unbalancing the image, which places all the other partygoers at \nground level. Spielberg\u201fs creation of pictorial tension here is felicitous, intensifying \nthe narrative\u201fs sense of foreboding around the central couple.  \n Moreover the shot is graphically emblematic, anticipating the character \nrelationships as they will develop subsequently in the film. Pete is positioned apart \nfrom, and above, the partygoers (prefiguring his heavenly vantage point, and his \nsubsequent isolation from the sphere of human action); Dorinda represents the shot\u201fs \nfocal point, just as she will remain central to both Pete and Ted\u201fs concerns; and Ted \nobserves Dorinda with interest, waiting patiently for an opportunity to approach her. \nSpielberg here exceeds the scene\u201fs denotative requirements, orchestrating the pictorial \nfield to portend, diagrammatically, future interplay among the characters. The \ncriticism that Spielberg repudiates subtlety and nuance holds little water here. \nSubtlety derives not only from the delicate expressiveness of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, but \nalso from the shot\u201fs precise placement in the overall narrative. Through \u201eanticipatory\u201f \nshots such as this, Spielberg creates a visual texture dense with narrative echoes and \nforward-pointing connotations.  \n A comparable density and subtlety informs Spielberg\u201fs sonic techniques. \nAlways opens with diegetic sound laid over a black screen (a favourite opening \n 10 \ngesture in Spielberg, as Buckland has shown). Initially the sound is ambiguous: a \nseries of distended wails evokes the noise of a siren, but the fading in of the film\u201fs \nopening image forces us to revise our initial assumptions. A long shot shows two \nanglers boating on a lake: now the noise we hear must be denotatively understood as \nthe intermingled calls of loons on the water.  \n But the initial, less communicative use of sound ought not to be dismissed as \nirrelevant. Evoking siren noises lets Spielberg adumbrate later scenes at the airbase, in \nwhich alarms ring out to signal an aerial firefighter in distress. Just as Spielberg \nfreights his pictorial strategies with narrative significance, so his use of sound \nanticipates upcoming action. Moreover, this evocative and misleading sound effect \nserves an intertextual purpose. It summons to mind nothing so much as the air raid \nsirens sprinkled throughout A Guy Named Joe, thus constituting one more allusion to \nthe wartime setting that Spielberg\u201fs film jettisons. In all, Spielberg enriches his \nstylistic techniques by assigning them wide-ranging functions: his stylistic strategies \noutreach the role of narrative denotation to perform narrational tasks (such as \nforeshadowing), connote expressive or symbolic significance, and evoke extrafilmic \npoints of reference.   \n Spielberg\u201fs achievement of formal integrity comes into still sharper focus \nwhen we compare parallel scenes in Always and A Guy Named Joe. Both films furnish \na barroom sequence in which Pete presents Dorinda with the birthday gift of a \ndazzling white dress. A spectacle of feminine display provides the scene\u201fs apogee in \nboth films, as Dorinda emerges wearing the sparkling dress to command the gaze of \nthe (predominantly male) crowd of revellers. Spielberg\u201fs interpretation of the \nsequence in Always resulted in, as Lester Friedman notes, \u201ethe film\u201fs most \nconsistently criticised scene\u201f (Friedman 2006, 16), principally due to its old-fashioned, \nchauvinistic gender depictions.\n6\n But contemporary sensibilities checked at the door, \nSpielberg\u201fs sequence is, as we\u201fll see, a model of narrative and stylistic unity.   \n Partway through the barroom scene in A Guy Named Joe, Pete instructs \nDorinda (Irene Dunne) to put on the dress, at which point she dutifully leaves the field \nof action. Dorinda is seemingly forgotten as the scene develops. Dramatic conflict \ndiverts our attention to other matters, as Pete and Al (Ward Bond) lock horns with \ntheir superior officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nils (James Gleason). After Nils leaves, \nPete and Al sit down to discuss their futures. A medium shot frames Pete slightly off-\ncenter in three-quarter profile, with Ted at the left of frame turned away from camera. \n 11 \nAs Pete interacts with Al, his eyeline drifts into an area of offscreen space; his gaze \nfixes, and suddenly Pete is compelled to suspend his speech in mid-sentence. Fleming \nwithholds visual access to the object that mesmerises Pete. Al turns his head to follow \nthe direction of Pete\u201fs gaze; now both men are turned toward camera, gazes fixed into \noffscreen space. At this point, Fleming provides the communicative shot that reveals \nthe locus of their attention: Dorinda, framed in long shot to accent her attractive \u201egirl \nclothes,\u201f stands at the top of the barroom\u201fs flight of stairs. A tightened reverse shot \nemphasises Pete\u201fs breathless reaction. Once Dorinda reaches the bottom of the stairs, \nshe is framed once more in long shot. Finally, to indicate Dorinda\u201fs captivating effect \non the barroom\u201fs clientele, Fleming arrays a soldier or two, in back-to-camera \npositions, across the shot\u201fs foreground.  \n The parallel sequence in Always retains key stylistic gestures from A Guy \nNamed Joe, yet Fleming\u201fs setpiece looks quite pedestrian alongside Spielberg\u201fs \ntreatment of the scene. The latter is at once more elaborate and dramatically charged. \nAs in the earlier film, Always initially presents Pete and Al seated at a table in \nmedium shot. Throughout their conversation, Pete\u201fs eyes dart past the right edge of \nthe frame, anxiously surveying the offscreen space for Dorinda\u201fs return. Spielberg \nrivets his camera on Pete as the protagonist\u201fs speech breaks off abruptly and his gaze \nbecomes magnetised by an out-of-shot spectacle. Like Fleming, Spielberg defers the \ncommunicative shot of Dorinda, but whereas Fleming lingered on Pete and Al\u201fs \nsurprised faces, Spielberg pads out the sequence with reaction shots. A low-angled \ncomposition shows an assembly of rubbernecking firefighters, heads turned to face \nthe offscreen heroine. Ambient sounds dissolve into a chorus of jumbled gasps. In the \nfollowing shot, the lower frameline crops the bodies of other male firefighters, but \nthey move helpfully into a legible framing by uniformly rising from the floor in \namazement.  \n Next a long shot returns us to Pete and Al, Pete rising silently from his chair. \nA repressive close-up then juxtaposes the grubby boots of firefighters, retreating \nbackward down the stairs, with Dorinda\u201fs spotless white shoes which come elegantly \ninto frame. Spielberg introduces Dorinda into this phase of action gradually: a high-\nangled shot is slightly more communicative, but Dorinda is nevertheless framed from \nbehind and out of focus. Pete shuffles toward the camera (and hence toward Dorinda), \nfinally walking into a pronounced close up, the better to convey his facial expression \nof astonishment. In a new composition, the node of our visual attention is blocked by \n 12 \na circle of firefighters in back-to-camera positions. Now Spielberg provides the payoff: \nsuddenly the circle separates and the obstructing bodies retreat to the frame\u201fs margins. \nDorinda is revealed at the center of the shot, and as in A Guy Named Joe, a distant \nframing highlights her physical transformation. Spielberg provides us with another \nreaction shot of Pete, who now summons the appropriate (albeit anachronistic) word: \n\u201eGosh.\u201f  \n Spielberg\u201fs staging of the scene manages not only to achieve fidelity to its \nprimary intertext but also to turn the ingredient elements of Fleming\u201fs sequence to \ngreater artistic advantage. Most obviously, Spielberg mines the sequence for suspense. \nA string of successive reaction shots dilates the action, building suspense by delaying \nthe revelation of spectacle (Dorinda\u201fs glowing physical appearance). Pete\u201fs frequent \nglances offscreen as he awaits Dorinda\u201fs return similarly function to create \nanticipation. These suspense tactics are justified and reinforced at a narrative level. As \nthe anxious glances offscreen make clear, narrational suspense radiates from Pete\u201fs \nown anticipation and curiosity about an impending event. And just as Spielberg\u201fs \nmontage of reaction shots suspends the moment of Dorinda\u201fs \u201eunveiling,\u201f so does the \nplot postpone Dorinda\u201fs re-emergence, by interpolating Pete\u201fs protracted conversation \nwith Al. To attend to this scene\u201fs style (e.g. repressive compositions, distended \nmontage) and story (e.g. Pete\u201fs apprehension) is to discover how both are organically \nfused to engender a specific narrational effect: suspense.     \n Spielberg takes several cues from the Fleming sequence and intensifies them \nfor dramatic purpose. The deferment of Dorinda\u201fs entrance derives from A Guy \nNamed Joe, but whereas Fleming distils the revelation into two shots (Pete\u201fs offscreen \ngaze\/ the ensuing cut to Dorinda) Spielberg furnishes eight shots to amplify suspense. \nSpielberg also borrows Fleming\u201fs conceit of lining foreground planes of action with \nback-to-camera figures. Yet Spielberg makes more productive use of this technique \nthan does Fleming. As in A Guy Named Joe, the back-to-camera figures in Spielberg\u201fs \nsequence convey story information (e.g. that Dorinda occupies the center of attention \nin the bar); but Spielberg goes further by putting these laterally-arranged figures to \nnarrational use. Under Spielberg\u201fs aegis, the foreground bodies function as part of a \ngenerally repressive visual design, retarding our perceptual access to a crucial story \nelement (Dorinda). Spielberg thus adopts a compositional tactic from A Guy Named \nJoe and, without sacrificing its denotative story function, assimilates it into the \nnarration\u201fs wider mechanisms of suspense. In such ways, Spielberg\u201fs film swells \n 13 \nbeyond its classical counterpart, adapting and transcending Fleming\u201fs techniques to \ninvest the sequence with added value.\n7\n  \n In the process Spielberg sustains an internal norm. Dorinda\u201fs first appearance \nin Always is visually characterised by a similar principle of blockage and revelation. \nWe first see her in the watchtower. A foreground figure passes across the width of the \nframe, initially concealing her from view; as the obstructing character leaves the \nframe, we clearly see Dorinda sitting in a chair, though the narration is \ncharacteristically restricted: Dorinda is turned away from camera. Next, however, she \nspins on the chair and slides into a communicative close-up \u2013 an emphatic entrance \nthat, as Nigel Morris has noted (Morris 2007, 165), recalls a similar gesture performed \nby Orson Welles in Citizen Kane (1941). By reprising the principle of blockage and \nrevelation in the barroom sequence, Spielberg sustains the discursive pattern of \nintroducing Dorinda via a communicative shift from restricted to unrestricted \nnarration.\n8\n  \n Overall, Spielberg\u201fs barroom sequence plumbs and works fresh variations on \nits classical counterpart. Suspense is amplified and distended, narrational \nrestrictedness becomes more salient, and figure positioning is ascribed narrational \nfunctions. As we\u201fve suggested, moreover, Spielberg is not concerned only with \nintensifying Fleming\u201fs stylistic gestures. Rather his formal and stylistic choices are \ngoverned by the principle of organic unity: suspenseful narration is motivated by a \nprotagonist\u201fs psychological apprehension; figures in the diegesis adopt a nondiegetic \nnarrational function; and compositional tactics of blockage and revelation establish an \ninternal norm that coheres distinct phases of the plot. Controversy around its sexual \npolitics notwithstanding, the barroom sequence in Always serves as a small-scale \nparadigm of well-made storytelling.    \n \nFlaws, difficulties, ingenuities \nIf Always is generally well-told at the levels of style and story, are there more fine-\ngrained or small-scale passages of the film which seem potentially troubling or \nproblematic? In other words, can we point to internal qualities in the film to account \nfor its disappointing critical and audience reception? Lester Friedman (2006, 16) has \nnoted one striking idiosyncrasy in the film\u201fs narrative development. Always flouts \nHollywood convention by inverting the generic romance trope: contrary to the norms \nof the genre, Spielberg\u201fs romantic couple must learn to live apart from each other. It\u201fs \n 14 \nplausible that audiences found this plot trajectory unsatisfying \u2013 though as we\u201fve \nsuggested, the plot itself is tightly woven and demonstrates a careful imbrication of \nstory, style, and motivic elements.\n9\n \n Joseph McBride has pointed to the characterisation of Ted as an especially \nweak element (McBride 1997, 408). Spielberg\u201fs interest in the character indeed seems \nnegligible; it is Pete\u201fs posthumous relationship with Dorinda that is most central to \nthe director\u201fs concerns. Further, certain specific storytelling limitations and \ncomplications spring from the figure of Ted. As already noted, Pete\u201fs angelic abilities \ninclude that of funnelling thoughts, mood states, and physical gestures through his \npliable young ward. From one angle, this story conceit helps the plot cohere by \ngenerating parallelisms. For example, in the film\u201fs second reel Dorinda observes that \nPete laughs \u201elike a donkey\u201f; four reels later, Ted laughs in precisely the same way, \nattracting Dorinda\u201fs attention. In reel three Pete nervously tweaks his eyebrow; by \nreel eight Ted develops the same nervous tic. Spielberg\u201fs dramatic premise \u2013 that Pete \ncan manipulate Ted\u201fs behavioural patterns \u2013 is particularly apt to sprout proliferating \nechoes, parallels, and repetitions, all of which can lend cohesion to large-scale blocks \nof action.  \n From another angle, though, the cost of so much motivic play is a diminution \nof character individuation. Pete\u201fs and Ted\u201fs individualised personality traits, \nincluding their discrete goals and desires, are conflated. Most problematically, Ted \nbecomes less a discretely individuated character than a fuzzy manifestation of Pete. \nConsequently the film equivocates as to whose psychology governs Ted\u201fs actions at \ndifferent junctures: are Ted\u201fs actions and desires his own or those of his spiritual \nmentor? The difficulty here arises because a narrative conceit and a norm of the well-\ntold story are put into conflict. In Always, the uniqueness and singularity of living \nhuman beings is attenuated because mortals inherit personality traits (\u201einspiration\u201f) \nfrom the dead. This theme of ghostly inspiration thus generates a tension with the \nprinciple of character individuation \u2013 one of the most basic norms of a well-made \nstory.\n10\n  \n A further weakness may be found in Spielberg\u201fs maintenance of a verbal motif \nassigned to Pete: \u201eThat\u201fs my boy,\u201f invoked throughout the film in reference to Ted. \nSpielberg appropriates the phrase from the Victor Fleming film, though Always will \ndepart from its source in its handling of the motif. Again, a comparison of the two \nfilms is instructive. A Guy Named Joe has Spencer Tracy\u201fs wartime pilot eliciting \n 15 \neager admiration from a clique of local children. However, Spielberg excises these \nmoments of schoolboy adulation, partly, I would suggest, because such scenes run \ncounter to his aims to deheroicise Pete; also, the schoolboys\u201f reverence for Pete in A \nGuy Named Joe carries a propagandistic motive inappropriate for Spielberg\u201fs \ndepoliticized romance story. Spielberg also repudiates an ironic character trait seeded \nearly on in A Guy Named Joe: Pete\u201fs professed dislike of children. Across the Victor \nFleming film, Pete\u201fs ambivalence toward children becomes paralleled in his \nrelationship to Ted, his younger prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and love rival. By the end of A Guy Named \nJoe, Pete utters the verbal motif earnestly in regard to Ted \u2013 thus attesting to his \nnewfound acceptance of paternal responsibility.  \n From this standpoint A Guy Named Joe\u201fs early scenes, showing Pete\u201fs \nambivalence toward younger male characters, set up an arc of character development \nthat Pete will trace across the duration of the film. In Fleming\u201fs film, then, the \nrepeated phrase \u201eThat\u201fs my boy\u201f becomes a dramatically motivated and emotionally \ncharged motif. By contrast, Spielberg attenuates the motif\u201fs expressive power by \nremoving the scenes that elucidate its purpose and supply its dramatic impetus. As a \nresult, the \u201eThat\u201fs my boy\u201f motif, as intoned by Spielberg\u201fs protagonist, merely traces \na schematically expressive arc from mild sarcasm to a barely motivated paternal \npride.\n11\n  \n Further criticisms cluster around Ted\u201fs oafish personality traits. One critic \nargues that \u201e[Spielberg] imbalances the drama\u2026by making Ted a cartoonish oaf\u201f \n(McBride 1997, 408). Moreover, others have argued, if Ted is such a bumbling figure, \nhow can he plausibly rival Pete for Dorinda\u201fs affections? Yet this aspect of Ted\u201fs \ncharacterisation seems to me quite straightforwardly justified. Ted\u201fs buffoonery \nshould properly be seen as the initial phase of a long-range character arc. Spielberg \nconfines Ted\u201fs blundering actions to early phases of story action; as the film \nprogresses, and as Ted unknowingly falls under Pete\u201fs tutelage, his traits of ineptness \nrecede; finally, by the film\u201fs denouement, Ted\u201fs maladroit qualities are eradicated \naltogether. Spielberg shows Ted to have inherited Pete\u201fs attributes of competence and \nself-assurance. Furthermore, Ted\u201fs imperfections provide crucial motivation for the \nmentorship plotline: possessed of personality flaws, Ted requires Pete\u201fs tacit guidance \nto trace an arc of character improvement. A fixture of the well-made Hollywood \nnarrative \u2013 character change \u2013 thus underwrites Ted\u201fs lumbering qualities. By initially \n 16 \nforegrounding Ted\u201fs clumsiness, Spielberg establishes a baseline against which the \ncharacter\u201fs subsequent proficiency stands out in relief. \n Significantly, moreover, Dorinda\u201fs deepening affection for Ted coincides not \nwith the latter\u201fs inelegant behaviour in the story\u201fs early phase, but with his gradual \nassumption of more conventionally masculine traits. The turning point occurs when \nDorinda sees Ted resuscitate a stricken bus driver: now Ted\u201fs emerging traits of poise \nand composure (a marked reversal of his earlier awkwardness) persuade Dorinda of \nhis suitability as a romantic partner. Character development here helps facilitate a \ndesirable plot trope \u2013 Dorinda\u201fs romantic pairing with Ted \u2013 which comes to feel \nincreasingly apposite as the plot progresses.  \n We can isolate at least two other ostensibly problematic manoeuvres. \nCrucially the manoeuvres in question become problematic because they challenge the \norganicity of the text. Yet as I will argue presently, Spielberg\u201fs strategies here are by \nno means detrimental to storytelling concerns and, on the contrary, function to create \nimportant narrative effects. The first apparent difficulty arises from Spielberg\u201fs \noccasionally bold disdain of narrative redundancy. Hollywood films, as Kristin \nThompson states, \u201etend to convey information about\u2026character traits, and indeed any \nsort of story factors redundantly\u201f (Thompson 1999, 16). Yet Spielberg sometimes \nrefuses to underline significant story action, thus demanding that the viewer be \nespecially alert and attentive. Minimising redundancy, moreover, allows Spielberg to \nachieve certain narratively apposite effects. Consider Pete\u201fs first encounter with his \ncelestial cynosure, Hap (Audrey Hepburn). On a patch of hallowed earth, Hap \nsubjects Pete to a haircut \u2013 an apparently inexplicable and outr\u00e9 action devoid of plot \nsignificance. We shouldn\u201ft be surprised to find that, in fact, Spielberg foreshadows \nthe haircut motif in an earlier scene (Dorinda mutters the word \u201ehaircut\u201f in her sleep). \nWhat is surprising is the insufficient degree of redundancy with which Spielberg \nestablishes the motif. On the first occasion, \u201ehaircut\u201f is merely one item on a mumbled \nlitany of mundane tasks (along with shopping for cat food, green apples, and chicken \nwings). Given that the motif is underdetermined, it is likely that the viewer will fail to \nlink Pete\u201fs haircut with Dorinda\u201fs earlier enumeration of chores. Consequently, Hap\u201fs \nhairdressing activity is apt to appear both idiosyncratic and unmotivated.  \n Yet the bizarre and incongruous tenor of this scene is entirely appropriate for a \nfirst foray into the unknown and fantastic. Stressing the action\u201fs apparent randomness \nis one way in which Spielberg marks this fantastic scene off from the reality of \n 17 \npreceding action. More precisely, it is Spielberg\u201fs attenuation of redundancy and \ncausal motivation that generates the action\u201fs ambiguity \u2013 ambiguity that fully befits \nPete\u201fs disorienting situation. As often in Always, apparent inadequacies at one level of \nstorytelling turn out to buttress other dimensions of story and theme.  \n Spielberg also risks a putatively troubling play with character goals \u2013 the \nsecond of our apparently problematic manoeuvres. The first of Pete\u201fs seraphic \nobjectives is to provide Ted with divine inspiration. A second goal, as Hap explains, \nis \u201eto say goodbye\u201f to Dorinda. The difficulty here is twofold. Neither of Pete\u201fs goals \nis self-directed; rather, in contrast to the purposeful Hollywood protagonist, goals are \n\u201ethrust upon\u201f him by his omnipotent counsel (Thompson 1999, 14). More importantly, \nthe late-arriving second goal is antithetical to Pete\u201fs (autonomous) desire to \u201enever \nleave [Dorinda] again.\u201f It\u201fs not only that Pete\u201fs goals here undertake an abrupt volte-\nface, but also that the narration is revealed to have withheld a crucial character goal \nfrom us. As Spielberg has noted, \u201e\u2026now that [Pete has] gone, his mission \u2013 so to \nspeak, even though he doesn\u2019t know what his mission is \u2013 is to come back and say all \nthe things he was never able to say as a living human being\u201f (quoted in Friedman and \nNotbohm 2000, 146, my italics). In contrast to Hollywood convention, whereby \ncharacter goals are consciously pursued and redundantly underscored, a key character \nimperative is here kept latent until Spielberg\u201fs narration becomes more \ncommunicative. Moreover, the goal itself may frustrate audience expectations. If the \nplot has been pressing toward some kind of desirable reunion between Pete and \nDorinda, the instalment of the second goal effectively denies fulfilment of this \nanticipated trope.       \n Nevertheless the revelation of Pete\u201fs second goal resolves a narrative tension. \nHeretofore, the viewer\u201fs desire for Pete and Dorinda to be reconciled is paralleled by \na growing consciousness of Ted and Dorinda\u201fs compatibility as a romantic couple. \nUntil the second goal is disclosed, allegiance with Pete prevents the viewer from \nregarding Ted and Dorinda\u201fs courtship as a wholly desirable trope. Revealing the \nsecond goal thus dispels a central plot ambiguity and dissipates the spectator\u201fs \nconflicting desires.  \n Still another effect emerges from Spielberg\u201fs deferred revelation of the second \ngoal. Now the viewer is forced to re-evaluate previous action involving Ted. During \nthe early barroom sequence, for instance, Ted\u201fs attempts to dance with Dorinda are \nretarded, an eventuality that, on initial viewing, elicits the viewer\u201fs approval. For at \n 18 \nthis early narrative stage, Ted is perceived to threaten the central romance between \nPete and Dorinda, the figures with whom we are most closely allied. Retrospectively, \nhowever, we must reconfigure Ted\u201fs thwarted overtures as so many false starts in a \ncosmically destined romance. In all, Spielberg\u201fs purposive distribution of character \ngoals undercuts conventional goal-orientation, derails expectations, compels the \nviewer to retread prior action, and discloses the narration\u201fs restrictedness. Frustrating \nfor a mainstream audience this may be; but there is no denying the bold ingenuity of \nSpielberg\u201fs narrational tactics. \n These two apparently problematic aspects of Spielberg\u201fs film \u2013 partial \nredundancy and late-arriving, antithetical character goals \u2013 are perhaps not disruptive \nenough to qualify as disunities, but neither do they assimilate neatly into the film\u201fs \noverarching system of internal unity. Both tactics pose difficulties. Spielberg primes \nthe haircut motif (albeit in oblique fashion) during Dorinda\u201fs somnambulistic itinerary, \nbut the motif remains hermeneutically opaque. It is not perspicuous at the primary \nlevel of story denotation. Nor is the revelation of Pete\u201fs second goal seamlessly \nabsorbed as an increment of organic unity, since it seems not only to thrust against \nPete\u201fs goal-oriented trajectory but also to be tenuously primed by foregoing action. \nHowever, these problematic qualities perform effective narrative functions (e.g. \nfacilitating an appropriate level of defamiliarisation; resolving a central hesitation \nbetween prospective narrative pathways). The point is that such detours from organic \nunity can function nevertheless to advance, inflect, or deepen the narrative in \nimportant ways. Filmmakers may slacken the precepts of organic unity in order to \npursue other effects no less related to storytelling. (For example, while the haircut \nmotif is causally impoverished and enigmatic in hermeneutic terms, it nonetheless \ngenerates a narratively apt effect: strangeness.) Moreover the filmmaker may swerve \nfrom organic unity at a local level, without structurally destabilising the film as a \nwhole. Such small-scale \u201edigressions\u201f as we are describing in Always may be \nsubordinated to a wider structural framework in which compositional unity is the \nprimary organising principle.  \n Although we can accurately characterise Always as a generally well-told story \nthat on the whole manifests organic unity, we need to acknowledge that the film \noccasionally deviates from the lockstep rigour of organicity \u2013 and furthermore, that \nsuch deviations are not necessarily antithetical to the demands of story, character, and \ntheme. Does this admission render Always \u201eincoherent\u201f, as some postmodernist critics \n 19 \nwould have it? Not in the least \u2013 for these moments of \u201edisturbance\u201f take place within \na stable, overriding framework that privileges organic fusion, synthesizing its salient \nparts into a single expressive whole. Moreover, as we\u201fve said, such deviations \nultimately serve story functions, contributing circuitously to the narrative\u201fs overall \ncoherence. Even a well-told story governed by aesthetic unity permits a certain degree \nof structural looseness. The best way to grasp the film\u201fs organically tenuous elements \nis to recognise these elements as motivated by some other storytelling concern, i.e. \nsome motivation apart from the keynote principle of tight causal patterning. Spielberg \nmay generally be pledged to an organicist aesthetic, but he is not intractably beholden \nto it. A film such as Always can slacken its unifying principles yet still evince the \nhallmarks of a well-told story.  \n \nGiven that the problematic aspects of Always are contained within an overarching \nunifying structure, it is doubtful that they engendered the film\u201fs critical and \ncommercial failure. As inadequacies, difficulties, and latent ingenuities, they are \nhardly flagrant.\n12\n If contemporary critics worried that the creative vision that \ndistinguished such films as Duel (1971) and Jaws (1975) had deserted Spielberg, a \nmore careful inspection of Always would have assuaged their fears. As I have argued, \nSpielberg orients his formal and stylistic strategies to the requirements of storytelling: \nhis shots may exceed narrative denotation to serve symbolic purpose; he makes \nexpressive and portentous use of blocking and figure movement; and he achieves a \nstudied unity of style and narrative, harnessing aural and visual techniques to the \ndenotative and expressive demands of the story.  \n If some critical traditions have faulted Spielberg (and other so-called \npostclassical filmmakers) for elevating spectacle above narrative coherence, I have \ntried to show that Always carries forward an organic conception of filmic parameters, \nand moreover, instantiates its unifying strategies with considerable tact.\n13\n Spielberg \ndiscreetly packs Always with bits of foreshadowing, recurring motifs, and internal \nnorms, engendering the kind of intricately-wrought coherence that is endemic to the \nwell-made film. \n Apart from its internal coherence, Always exhibits a unifying engagement with \nSpielberg\u201fs authorial body of work. Favourite themes nest on the film\u201fs surface: the \nnarrative trope of separation and reunion\n14\n; a protagonist forced to reconcile juvenile \nimpulses with adult responsibility; and the recurrent commitment to fantastic \n 20 \nnarratives. Allusion calls forth pertinent precursors, as in the closing scene\u201fs visual \ncitation of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Evocations of World War II \nand an emphasis on flight recall most immediately Empire of the Sun (1987) and 1941 \n(1979). The symbiosis linking Pete and Ted evokes the somatic connection between \nElliott (Henry Thomas) and the alien in E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982). And both \nthe casting of Richard Dreyfuss and the orchestral score by John Williams inevitably \nsummon to mind Jaws, as well as Close Encounters. Just as Always internally \noverflows with organically unifying elements, so it abounds with authorial \ncontinuities that assimilate coherently into an ongoing body of work. \n As we have seen, Always is defensible against the most salient of its critical \nreproaches. Relinquishing the wartime context makes character flaws come forward \nwith a great deal of force. And Spielberg\u201fs apparently troubling use of dusty movie \ndialogue conforms to canonic principles of construction. Far from slavishly reviving \nhackneyed movie dialogue, Spielberg molds the film\u201fs anachronistic speech into \nmaterial apt to create organic unity. In Spielberg\u201fs hands, exhausted phrases become \nmeaningful motifs, unifying discrete blocks of action and expressively conveying \nchanges in character psychology. Thus even the manoeuvres that most trouble the \nfilm\u201fs critics can be seen to obey coherent compositional norms. In all, this enigmatic \nand intriguing film warrants revaluation within the Spielberg canon. At the very least, \nAlways demonstrates that a gifted filmmaker can handle standardized \u2013 one might \neven say \u201ehackneyed\u201f \u2013 storytelling devices in deft and inventive ways.  \n \n \n 21 \nNotes \n                                                 \n1\n Cf. Jaws (1975): $458m worldwide gross; E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982): \n$701m; Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989): $494.7m (McBride 1997; \nFriedman 2006; Nathan 1999). \n2\n Aristotle writes that a plot must represent \u201ea complete whole, with its several \nincidents so closely connected that the transposition or withdrawal of any one of them \nwill disjoin and dislocate the whole. For that which makes no perceptible difference \nby its presence or absence is no real part of the whole\u201f (Aristotle 1984, 2322). The \nimportance of organic unity as a criterion for film art dates back at least to Hugo \nM\u00fcnsterberg (see M\u00fcnsterberg 1970, especially Part II: \u201eThe Esthetics of the \nPhotoplay\u201f). \n3\n The contours of the incoherence argument have been well explicated elsewhere (see \nfor example Kr\u00e4mer 1999). Like Buckland, others have cogently rebuked this \nconventional wisdom. Counterarguments to the incoherence thesis are advanced in \nBordwell 2006, King 2000, and Thompson 1999. With respect to Spielberg, see \nBuckland 1998 and 2006. \n4\n A corresponding attack is set forth by Pauline Kael: \u201e[Spielberg] has caught the \nsurface mechanics of \u201f40s movies [but has] no grasp of the simplicity that made them \naffecting. He overcooks everything, in a fast, stressful style\u201f (Kael 1990). \n5\n For M\u00fcnsterberg, writing in the silent era and disdaining the prospect of talkies, \norganic unity involved the harmonious cooperation of \u201eplot and pictorial appearance\u201f, \nnot sound. (See M\u00fcnsterberg 1970, 82.) In contrast to the organicist perspective, \nDavid Bordwell has argued that an organic theory of film style ignores the decorative \nfunction that some filmmakers (such as Ozu Yasujiro) assign to stylistic devices. He \nwrites: \u201ewe need not adopt either an organic or an ornamental definition of style a \npriori. We need only say that in some cases, style may work \u201corganically\u201d to convey \nmeaning or expressive qualities, and that in other cases, it may seem \u201capplied,\u201d or laid \nover other components or structures\u201f (Bordwell 2008, 378). \n6\n This sequence markedly puts on display Dorinda\u201fs tomboyish traits and her \nambivalence toward conventional femininity \u2013 an amalgam of traits that recalls Holly \nHunter\u201fs earlier role in James L. Brooks\u201f Broadcast News (1987). It seems probable \nthat Spielberg\u201fs adroit casting of Hunter was inspired by the actor\u201fs role in Brooks\u201f \nromantic comedy. \n 22 \n                                                                                                                                            \n7\n My argument that Always intensifies Fleming\u201fs compositional and narrational tactics \nought not to be conflated with David Bordwell\u201fs concept of \u201eintensified continuity.\u201f \nAlthough Always can be shown to adopt the idiom of intensified continuity (e.g. \ncomparatively fast cutting, close framings, extreme lens lengths, and restless camera \nmovement), my main concern here is to suggest that Spielberg appropriates specific \ntactics of delay and revelation (e.g. character reactions, foreground figures) and \naccentuates them. For intensified continuity, see Bordwell 2002. \n8\n This norm seems to be applied in particular to major turning points involving \nDorinda. Spielberg repeats the pattern immediately after Pete\u201fs death. A close view of \nthe watchtower door announces a restricted narration; the shift to unrestricted \nnarration occurs when the door is opened, revealing Dorinda positioned obliquely in \nthe background. Recall also Pete\u201fs first posthumous glimpse of Dorinda. Here an \nairplane wing blocks Pete\u201fs view of the heroine; as Pete crouches to look beyond the \nwing tip, Spielberg\u201fs camera reframes and racks focus to present Dorinda more \nlegibly. \n9\n Radical as an inversion of Hollywood norms sounds, the film\u201fs story is in fact \nemphatically conservative in its ideological underpinnings. For instance, the film\u201fs \ninverted romance trope only serves to reinforce mainstream values: dispossessed of \none heterosexual romance, Dorinda simply forges a new heterosexual relationship \nwith Ted. Always also decisively circumvents a \u201esubversive\u201f physical romance \nbetween Dorinda and her deceased lover. \n10\n This conflation of traits also muddies a conventional romance trope: namely, that a \nromantic couple is destined to be together on the basis of fundamentally compatible \ntraits. Yet many of the personality traits that Dorinda finds attractive in Ted are those \nsomatically channelled by her late paramour. The romantic suitability of Dorinda and \nTed, so crucial to their union being a desirable outcome for the spectator, is not \ntherefore unequivocally established. \n11\n It is ironic that this theme in particular should be underdetermined in Always, given \nthe salience of father-son relations within Spielberg\u201fs oeuvre. \n12\n Nor can one fault the conception of the project itself. Spielberg\u201fs idea of remaking a \n1940s movie about the afterlife had a prestigious precedent in Heaven Can Wait \n(1978), a reworking of Here Comes Mr Jordan (1941). With Heaven Can Wait, \nWarren Beatty showed that modern filmmakers could remake a classical film with \n 23 \n                                                                                                                                            \nsubject matter strikingly similar to that of A Guy Named Joe, and achieve substantial \ncritical and commercial success. In the year following Always, moreover, Ghost (1990) \nemployed a similar story premise with outstanding box-office results \u2013 ironically and \nindirectly vindicating Spielberg\u201fs choice of story material, and confirming his savvy \nmarket awareness. \n13\n Consider the host of visual parallels in Always that yoke together distinct stretches \nof story action. The film\u201fs opening shot is evoked near the end of reel one, when two \nforeground figures (Pete and Al) are frozen in the path of an ominously descending \nplane (advancing through the background planes of space, now piloted by Dorinda). \nPete smears oil on Al\u201fs cheeks in the first reel, an action that is recapitulated (this \ntime thanks to the power of suggestion) in reel four \u2013 a slapstick routine that supplies \nboth comic relief and intertextual allusion. (Spielberg inherits and reworks the oil gag \nfrom A Guy Named Joe.) Yellow-outfitted firefighters clamber down the steps of the \nwatchtower to make way for Dorinda, furious at Pete\u201fs haphazard flying; during the \nensuing party sequence, they peel away in awe as Dorinda descends the staircase \ndressed in a shimmering white dress \u2013 a motivic juxtaposition that embodies the \ncontrasting facets of Dorinda\u201fs psychology. Character dialogue, as we\u201fve seen, \nprovides a further unifying element. In the bar, Dorinda implores Pete to articulate his \nlove for her, pleading: \u201ePlease, please, please\u201f; in the previous forward-cleaving \nsequence, she breathlessly utters the same phrase as Pete\u201fs plane begins its precarious \ndescent. \n14\n Peter Kr\u00e4mer argues that this trope, so central to Always, can be seen to thread \nthrough several of Spielberg\u201fs films since E.T. (Kr\u00e4mer, \u201eSteven Spielberg, Oskar \nSchindler, and the Holocaust\u201f, paper delivered at the Spielberg at Sixty International \nConference, 21 November 2007). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 24 \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nReferences \n \nAristotle. 1984.
