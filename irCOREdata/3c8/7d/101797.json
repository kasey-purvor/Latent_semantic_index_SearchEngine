C. Smith', J. D. Carey and S. R. P. Silva \nAdvanced Technology Institute, School of Electronics and Physical Sciences, \nUniversity of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom \nAbstract \nSimulations of electric field enhancement factor, p, for isolated metallic carbon nanotubes (CNT) are \nreported. We show that p is dependent not only on the geometry of the tubes, but also on the location of the \nanode electrode. We also highlight the effect of field screening due to boundary conditions of the simulation \npackage. Finally, we give an expression for p as a function of CNT height, radius, and anode to cathode \nseparation. \nIntroduction \nSince the identification of carbon nanotubes (CNT) [l] there has been considerable interest in their use \nin vacuum microelectronics and nanoelectronics [2]. This has been brought about by sustained research in the \nfield of carbon based cold cathodes coupled with the ability to alter the geometric field enhancement factor, p, by \ntailoring the physical dimensions (length and radius) of the tubes. The role of p is the enhancement of the applied \nmacroscopic field such that under the action of the local electric field efficient tunnelling of electrons can occur \nfrom the Fermi level through a potential banier. \nSimulation \nThe CNT were simulated, using the Silvaco TM \npackage, in two dimensions having height h, radius r, \nvertically aligned with a hemispherical cap on a grounded \nsubstrate separated by a distance D from a flat anode in a \nworkarea of width W as shown in Fig. 1. In this \nconfiguration the CNT and substrate represent an \nequipotential surface. \nFig. 1. Layout of simulation. \nResults and diseussion \nThe simulation package has inbuilt boundary conditions which mirrors to the left and right of the \nworkarea. Whilst this is important for device calculations, it means that when simulating a CNT in the centre of \nh e  workarea as shown in Fig. 1, there are mirrored CNTs to each side, screening the electric field. We show that \nthese effects become less important when the workarea width is greater than twice the height of the CNT. We \ninvestigate the role of the anode to cathode separation, D, on enhancement factors, which is calculated by local \nfield divided by applied field on both CNT and hemispheres. A frst test of a hemisphere with D=6, 20 and 36 \npm show a low threshold field at D=6 pm, but, higher and constant values for D=20 and 36 pm. Fig. 2. shows \nthe variation of enhancement factor which saturates at high D, but increases at low D for hemispheres of radius \n1,2, and 4pm. It can be seen that the saturated value of enhancement factor is 2 in all three cases, which we can \ntie in by solving a Laplace equation in two dimensions for a hemisphere. \nP i  \n4.. , . . . . . . . . , . . . . . . . . , . \n10 rm \n*rims. camma SeperaUan ($In) \nI \n0 - 7 8 0 3 - 8 3 @ & \/ 0 ~ . @ j I @ p ~ e n t  factor. 176 Fig. 3.

However in this case the saturated values of enhancement factors are \ndifferent for each CNT suggesting a relationship for p is based on just h and I. The saturated region in all \nsimulated hemispheres and CNTs becomes apparent when D is greater than three times the CNT height. \nThe widely used and accepted approximation that P=hir cis shown not to be applicable in al cases. \nCNTs of aspect ratios (h\/r) between 1 and 500 were simulated and the enhancement factor at high D was \nextracted to ensure no effects from the anode plane were observed. When log p was plotted against log hir a \nstraight-line relationship was found. For the expression of p h i r  to be true, this line had to have a gradient of 1. \nHowever in this case the gradient was 0.38. We fnrther went on to show that in the high D case the expression \nfor p, when a=2, is: \np= (1 + G)o.5 \nIn order to derive an expression for estimating the geometric enhancement factor for CNTs of given \nheight and radius, in a vacunm separated by anode and cathode electrode distance D apart, and correctly \nsimulated so any effects of screening due to simulation boundary conditions are at a minimum, there are two \ndistinct halves to consider. Firstly, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the role of D on p is high at low D, and negligible at \nhigh D. For the second half of the expression the values of the converged enhancement factors are a factor of \nCNT geometry alone and not D, as shown in equation 1. We conclude that the following expression is only valid \nfor low D and is given by: \nD \nD - h  \n__ \nThe equation above tends to 1 at high D, however, it is important that upon analysing the recorded data \nfor enhancement factors, the converged lines do not have a gradient of 0. They decrease slightly as D increases. \nWe can therefore say that equations 1 and 2 can be added together to obtain a realistic approximation for \nenhancement factors for all values of h, r and D, given by: \nConclusions \nWe have shown in this study the importance in understanding the simulation software when attempting \nto simulate isolated CNTs. The boundary conditions of the simulator mirror the workarea, which can cause \nproblems associated with adjacent tubes screening the field and reducing the emission cnrrent. \nIn examining the enhancement factor of first hemispheres and then CNTs we have shown that the ancde \nto cathode separation plays an important role and affects p greatly at low values of D. At high D we give an \nempirical relationship for p, based on the CNT h and r alone and is not dependant on D. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio Partnership and Carbon Based Electronics \nprogrammes for funding this research. \nReferences \n1 \n2 \nS.
