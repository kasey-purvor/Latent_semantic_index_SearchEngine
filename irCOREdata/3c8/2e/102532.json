INTRODUCTION\nThe Control Moment Gyro (CMG) offers high torque capa-\nbility and high power and mass efficiency and therefore plays\na key role in both satellite attitude stabilization and manoeu-\nvring [1]. In addition to the existence of singular modes, the\ncomplicated structure of the CMG actuator demands hardware\nredundancies. For some applications with limited resources,\nredundances might not be a suitable option. Therefore a\nconsiderable amount of effort has gone in the past decades\nin the area of underactuated attitude control. Underactuated\ncontrol is a scenario where fewer than three actuators are used\nto provide three axis control. Many results have been reported\nin cases of two pairs of thrusters and two reaction wheels [2]-\n[8]. The first application of underactuated attitude control was\ndone for a system with two pairs of thrusters. In this case,\nonly an asymmetric about the underactuated axis satellite can\nbe controllable as the coupling terms in the underactuated axis\ncan be used as a fictitious control input [5]-[7]. The attitude\nof the satellite can be globally stabilized by discontinuous\ntime-invariant feedback or time varying feedback control [2]-\n[7]. Considering momentum exchange devices, most of the\nresearch effort was concentrated to systems where the tota\nangular momentum is zero, i.e. the attitude can be globall,\nstabilized only if the initial angular velocity of the under\nactuated axis is zero and there is no disturbance about the\nunderactuated axis [9], [10]. From the results performed it\norbit using two reaction wheels, the effect of a small non-zer\nmomentum results in a rotation about the desired attitude [8]\nIn this paper, we study the underactuated control problem ot\na spacecraft equipped with two parallel CMGs. We seek for an\nefficient algorithm that is capable to deliver three axis attitude\nstabilization using two actuators under the influence of external\ndisturbances. We make the assumption that there also exist\nother means for damping the total angular momentum every\nAlexandre N.

In other words, the assumption is that although\nthe satellite is perturbed by external disturbances, the total an-\ngular momentum is still kept at low values. We first present the\nactuator configuration and then compare this with typical fully\nactuated CMG-based configurations. The system model is then\nderived. In Section 3, the stability and disturbance attenuation\nproperties are discussed. We demonstrate that there exists a\ncontrol law which can not only stabilize the attitude system but\nalso attenuate the disturbances leading to a dissipative system.\nSimulations are included to demonstrate the effectiveness in\nattenuating harmonic perturbations.\nII. UNDERACTUATED CMG ATTITUDE CONTROL\nA. Attitude Control with CMGs\nThe CMG produces torque by changing the direction of the\nangular momentum. With 6 representing the gimbal angle and\nh the angular momentum, the output torque T delivered by\nthe CMG can be written as T = h = J(6)6, where J(6)\nis the Jacobian matrix. A difficulty associated with CMGs\nin attitude control loops is the existence of singular states.\nAt a singularity, the CMG cannot generate a torque about a\nspecific direction i.e., the rank of the Jacobian matrix is less\nthan three. A special control algorithm, steering law, is used\nin conjunction with the attitude control loop to avoid or transit\nthrough the singularity. With the steering law in place, a typical\nattitude control loop with CMGs is presented in Fig 1. The\nsteering law guarantees that the output torque of the CMGs h\nequals the desired torque hdes\nFig. 1. Satellite attitude control loop with CMGs\nIn a system equipped with two CMGs, only two torque\ncomponents are independent. For a configuration of two par-\nallel CMGs, the torque about the third direction is zero. For a\n666\n1-4244-0818-0\/07\/$20.00 (\u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 06:54 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nsystem with two CMGs, the rank of the Jacobian matrix can\neven drop to one , which implies that the torque produced\nby two actuators is along one of satellite's principle body\naxes. Under this situation, singularity is considered as the\nscenario where only one torque output becomes available or\nequivalently the rank of J(c) is one. The problem of singular\navoidance for an underactuated system is then transformed\ninto a problem of how to manage the torque produced by two\nCMGs to be projected on the two axes.\nFor a system with two CMGs, in general only two torque\noutputs are independent and the third one is either zero or a\ncombination of the other two. Using hl, h2, h3 to represent\ntwo of the CMG's torque components, h3 can be written as\na function of the other two, i.e. h3 f (hl, h2). For a given\npair hl, h2, the linear function that depends on the physical\narrangements of the actuators allows computing h3. The idea\nis depicted in Fig. 2. The task of the steering law is to deliver\nthe identity h= hldes, h2 h2des5\nFig. 2. Satellite attitude control loop with two CMGs\nB. Modeling of Underactuated Attitude Control System with\nTwo CMGs\n1) Generic CMG pyramid configuration: Discarding the\ngimbal's inertia, the dynamic equation of a system with two\nCMGs can be written as\nChoosing Gibbs parameters (g1, g2,g3) to describe the at-\ntitude of the satellite and combining the kinematic equation\nwith the dynamic equation, the complete mathematical model\nis obtained as\nII =I -hI + T tI\n2&U2 -h2 + Te,t2\n-13&3 -f(hl, h2) + Text3\n1+g2 glg2-g3 glg3 +g2\na),+ 912 W2 +2 2 2\ng2gl+g3 1+ g g2g3 -gl2 2 2\n913-g2 gl +g2g3 12+g93\ng3 = (S+2 2 2\n(5)\n2) Configuration with two parallel CMGs: We now con-\nsider a case where two CMGs are installed in such a way that\ntheir gimbal axes are both aligned along the spacecraft's z-axis\n(Fig. 3).

STABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS\nDefining a state vector constructed by two angular velocities\nand three attitude parameters, the controller design task is to\nobtain a feedback law that renders a closed loop system around\na stable origin (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). This has to be also guaranteed\nunder the influence of external disturbances.\nFor the purpose of the controller design, we now construct\na state-space representation of (6)\nLI\n9)2\ngl\ng2\n3\nI\n0\n0\n0\n1\n- 0 01\n0 0\n-12\n+ 0 0 glg3 + g2\n2\n0 0 g9g3 g-\n2f+ 1 +B3\nf(x) +Biu+B2W\n[ Text1 1\nTezt2\nText3]\n(7)\nwhere Text3 f= 3 dt\nA. Problem statement\nFor the solution of the controller optimization task, a penalty\nfunction is defined as\ncl (w 1 -Wldd)\nC2(w2 W-J2d)\nq C3g1 (8)\nC4g2\nC5g3\nwhere wJld, WJ2d are designed trajectories yet to be defined.\nThe objective now is to find a state-feedback control law u\n[hl, h2]T and a positive definite and proper function V, such\nthat for a > 0, along the trajectories of the close-loop system,\none has [11]\nHJI (u, V) Vx (f (x) + Bu) + Vx B2BVXT + qTq < 0\n(9)\nThis guarantees that the energy of the penalty function is less\nthan or equal to the energy of the disturbance input.\nB. Main result\nProposition\nConsider (7) and the penalty function (8), there exists a pair\n(u, V) such that HJI(u, V) < 0.\nProof\nLet u =F h 1 F I, [ki (i -Wld))- ldl 1LL]h2 L 12 [k2 (&2 -2d) )- 2d]\nV (W - ld)2 + (W2 W2d)+ -+ +2 2 2 2 2\nwith\n2\nW+ld1g9+ 2 [(1+g)d\u00b1+(glg2 +g3)V2d]\n+ g 2 + g2+22( +gI)>d +(gIg-3)V\n+g2 +g93\n2\nW)2d 1g+ +g [(+g)V2d + ( g192 93)VId\/]\nV'ld -kg, + 2 292g + g2 + 0.001\n9193\nV2d =-kg2 - 2g1 + g2 + 0.001\nand k > 0, t > 0, k1 > 0, k2 > 0 [5], [8]. At that point we\nconclude that any positive gain parameters in the closed-loop\nabove will render to a stable closed-loop system.\nFurthermore, to analyze the disturbance attenuation proper-\nties, we use the Hamiltonian-Jacobian-Isaac inequality to pose\nsome constraints on the choice of the controller gains. After\nsimple but lengthy calculations this yields\nHJI(u, V) -(ki 42-11 C )W Wld)\n-(k2 42 - c ()w2 2d)\n-kg2 - kg2 _ Yg3 + C2g2 + C2g2 + C2g21 2g g3 g3 1 42 3\n22 93 + 2 + 2 +\n4-(y2 2I-2 )(2-2)2\n1 2 2\n(k2 - 421, cl)(w2i W2U)Id)\n[t 1 2)g~+ )2 c1g(k2 c (U)2 U)(20\nThis representation suggests that there exists a choice of the\ngains such that HJI becomes negative for state trajectories\nthat belong to a compact set such that (wld, W)2d, 0, 0, 0)\nbelongs to it. Therefore, selecting k, > 4j1 + cl, k2 >\n1al C2 2>2a(c,C), p > 41 (912 + 92 + 93 + )2 + 2\nresults in HJI(u, V) < 0.\nC. Discussion\n1) System Stability: Firstly, we set the disturbances to zero\nand consider only system stability.

Large values for k\nresult in fast convergence for (g1,g2). ,u, on another hand,\ndetermines the coupling ration and hence the convergence rate\nfor the underactuated axis.\n2) Disturbances attenuation: The proposition here is that\nthere exist a torque disturbance on the spacecraft such that\nall three axes are perturbed. Using the developments from the\nprevious section, we have demonstrated that three axis control\nand disturbance attenuation are possible. The control law can\nbring the system into a stable equilibrium point against worst-\ncase input. It can be shown that the attitude of the satellite\nwill convergent to the region g2 + g2 + gA < 47\/i - 1\nwhen k, > 4211 + cl, k2 > 47212 + c2, k > max(C3,C4). It\nis evident from this expression that the size of the region is\ncontrolled by M.\nIV. SIMULATION\nWe now present some simulation results. We recall to the\nfact that the following inequities need to be satisfied k, >\n1W + C2, k2 > I7 + C2 k > max(c3c2 ) H>412 92 +\n+ 2)2 + C5 in order to make all HJI(u,V) < 0 for all\n('J1 WSld, w1 W)2d, g1i 0, g2 + 0 and g3 + 0. The design\nparameters are set to cl c2 1, C3 C4 C5 2. For\nthe purpose of the analysis, kl, k2 and k are grouped together\nand At is separated. This allows us to study performance by\nsatisfying one or another group of parameters. We first set\nk= 10, k2 10, k At 5 and then to k= 0.8,\nk2 0.8, k At 1. In the first case both the stability\nand the disturbance attenuation properties are satisfied. For the\nsecond set we can only guarantee the stability of the control\nloop. In both cases, the disturbance on each axis is set to a\nsinusoidal signal of amplitude 0.01 and frequency one. Fig.\n4 and 5 display the attitude history from initial conditions\nset to (2, 1, 1). For the analysis of the disturbance attenuation\nproperties, we also display the value of the HJI function for\ndifferent gains.\nThe simulation results show that both combinations in the\ncontroller gains give a sable closed-loop system and a three\naxis stabilization using only two torque inputs. Figs. 4 and\n5, however, also show that by choosing the gains such that\nthe HJI is satisfied, better disturbance attenuation can be\nachieved. It has to be noted, however, that although higher\ncontroller gains might improve on the precision, care has to\nbe taken not to saturate the actuators.

CONCLUSIONS\nUnderactuated attitude control of satellites equipped with\ntwo parallel CMGs is investigated. A control law is derived and\na set of controller gains that guarantee stability and disturbance\nattenuation properties through a dissipation analysis. The con-\ntroller manages to deliver three axis attitude control with\nonly two torque inputs under the influence of disturbances.\nA compact set has been derived where all states would reside\nat the end of the transient and this set has been connected\nwith the controller gains. We also note that At is the only\nparameter that depends on the state vector. In our current\nresearch work we investigate the suitability for adapting it, for\nexample by taking ,u = I ( 92 + 92 + 92 + I )2+ C + , 6 > 0,\nHJI (9) can be rendered to be negative for all Wi 4 Wld,\nWJ1 W)2d, g1i 0, g2 + 0 and g3 + 0.
