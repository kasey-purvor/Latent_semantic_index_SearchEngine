Meindl in 2004, the leadership community lost a \npreeminent scholar, leader, and very dear mentor and friend. In the current paper we \nexplore key elements of Jim\u201fs legacy, with a particular focus on continuing research \nstreams and ongoing questions regarding the romance of leadership. In addition, in \nrecognition of the increased attention to follower-centered approaches to leadership that \nJim helped inspire, we offer a number of challenges to leadership researchers that in our \nview have yet to be met. We begin by briefly reviewing Jim\u201fs romance of leadership \nperspective and a selection of his seminal empirical work before exploring how the \nromance of leadership and his emphasis on followers and followers\u201f perceptions has been \nenacted in a multitude of ways and new research streams. For example, Meindl, Ehrlich, \nand Dukerich\u201fs (1985) paper alone has been cited over 160 times in other scientific \narticles. In addition, research streams referring to Meindl\u201fs work have emerged in at least \n11 different countries (e.g., USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Israel) and the \nromance of leadership perspective has been utilized across 16 different disciplines (most \nnotably in  management, psychology, and public administration). The current paper \nconcentrates on the impact the romance of leadership approach has had on leadership \nresearch in the past 20 years, giving rise to a number of ongoing questions and challenges \nthat remain open to future research to address. \n According to the romance of leadership view, people tend to overuse and glorify \nleadership as a causal category, due primarily to a psychological need to make sense of \ncomplex organizational phenomena. In addition, empirical research has demonstrated that \nthis tendency is strongest for more extreme situations, such as very high or low levels of \norganizational performance. Meindl et al.\u201fs (1985) empirical work confirmed that people \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 3 \ntend to over attribute organizational outcomes to leadership, and that this tendency \nincreases with the magnitude of such outcomes. More specifically, Meindl et al. (1985) \nfound that, when presented with extreme positive or negative outcomes of an \norganizational event, observers across three experiments were more likely to attribute \ncausality to the leader of the organization than to equally likely alternative sources (i.e., \nsubordinates and external causes). Using Meindl\u201fs (2004, p. 464) own words to describe \nthis approach, \u201cthe romance of leadership involves a psychology that highlights the \nbenefits of attributing outcomes to leadership. The faithful belief in leadership is itself \nbeneficial in providing a sense of comfort and security, in reducing feelings of \nuncertainty, and in providing a sense of human agency and control.\u201d   \nThis romanticized conception of leadership thus emphasizes the proactive \nefficacy of leadership, suggesting that leaders have the ability to control and influence the \nfates of the organizations in their charge, regardless of external forces or situational \nconditions. Ultimately, this assumption of control and responsibility can be a double-\nedged sword, for it not only implies that followers give leaders credit for positive \norganizational outcomes, but that they also attribute blame to leaders for negative results. \nThe romance of leadership thus points out that people commonly believe leaders are \ndirectly responsible for organizational outcomes (Meindl et al., 1985), and that through \nthis process of socially constructing organizational realities, the concept of leadership has \nbeen elevated or inflated to an often unwarranted status and significance. The \ncorresponding symbolism, imagery, mythology and stories associated with the concept of \nleadership are evidence of the mystery \u2013 or near mysticism \u2013 with which leadership has \nbeen imbued, and these socially constructed artifacts of leadership are worthy of study in \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 4 \ntheir own right, due to their potential insights into the followers\u201f needs, mindsets, and \nanxieties.  \nThis latter assertion about the research \u201cworthiness\u201d of the social construction of \nleadership has taken two primary forms within the leadership literature. First, a number \nof researchers have explored the implications of Meindl\u201fs (1995, p. 332) assertion that \n\u201creports made by followers regarding their leaders are treated as information regarding \nthe constructions of followers, not information about the qualities and activities of the \nleader as with more leader-centric approaches.\u201d  Thus, the romance of leadership \nperspective treats correlated perceptions or ratings of leadership as a revelation into the \nthought systems and ideologies of followers (Meindl, 1995), as well as evidence of social \ncontagion effects that focus attention on the ongoing interactions amongst followers and \nthe influence of these interactions on leadership ratings (Pastor & Mayo, 2006).  \nSecondly, at a more indirect and collective level, the romance of leadership \napproach has focused increased attention on the role of the media and social \nconstructions of leadership within a cultural group as worthy of study. Chen and Meindl \n(1991, p. 522) suggest that the media develop \u201cconstructions of leadership regularly and \nwidely for our consumption . . .These images feed and expand our appetites for \nleadership products, appealing not only to our collective commitments to the concept but \nfixating us in particular on the personas and characteristics of the leaders themselves.\u201d As \nJackson and Guthey (2006) point out, Chen and Meindl\u201fs work in this area was \ninfluential in highlighting the significance of the media in shaping and influencing ideas \nand beliefs about leadership, and for drawing attention to how visual images of CEOs and \ntop leaders deserve close scrutiny as an important window into how business celebrity, \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 5 \nfirm reputation, and corporate legitimacy are constructed and deconstructed in the media \n(Guthey & Jackson, 2005; Jackson & Guthey, 2006).   \n The current paper attempts to provide an overview for the reader of some of the \nresearch trends that have ensued since Meindl et al.\u201fs (1985) formulation of the romance \nof leadership theory. While we have not attempted to exhaustively review all of the \nresearch that has been linked to the romance of leadership perspective, we have attempted \nto distill some of the ongoing research streams that have carried on this perspective, and \nwe have organized each section by a \u201cleading question\u201d that various researchers have \nsought to address. In addition, we conclude with a number of questions that have yet to \nbe addressed by existing research, which we provide as suggestions and challenges to \nfuture scholars in this area. \nWhat is the role of followership vis-\u00e0-vis leadership?  \nIt has become almost a clich\u00e9 that \u201cwithout followers, there can be no leaders,\u201d \nand there have been various calls within the leadership literature dating at least back to \nthe 1930\u201fs suggesting that followers remain an overlooked variable in the leadership \nequation (Bjugstad, Thach, Thompson, & Morris, 2006). Despite periodic calls for \ngreater attention to followership, Collinson (2005) recently points out that mainstream \nleadership studies continue to privilege and separate leaders from followers. In his paper, \nCollinson (2005) argues for the value of rethinking leadership as a set of dialectical \nrelationships, in which leader-follower relations and practices are explicitly viewed as \nmutually constituting and co-produced. This approach serves to emphasize the inherent \ntensions, contradictions and ambiguities that often characterize leader-follower dynamics, \nand suggests that rather than replace a 'leader-centric' approach with a 'follower-centric\u201f \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 6 \napproach, we should move toward a more dialectical understanding of the complex, \ninteractional relationships between leaders and followers.  \nJim Meindl would have agreed. These arguments are consistent with Jim\u201fs own \nbeliefs that social constructionist processes do not negate or repudiate the often critical \nrole of leaders and leadership. Meindl did not advance the follower-centric approach as \n\u201canti-leadership,\u201d or an effort to compete with or to replace the dominant leader-centric \napproach (Jackson & Guthey, 2006). In contrast, Jim proposed the romance of leadership \nperspective as \u201can alternative to theories and perspectives that place great weight on \n\u201eleaders\u201f and on the substantive significance to their actions and activities\u201d (Meindl, \n1995, p. 330).  Thus, Jim\u201fs work did not reject the importance of leadership, but simply \nattempted to draw attention to the fact that \u201cit is easier to believe in leadership than to \nprove it\u201d (Meindl, 1990, p. 161), and suggested that as researchers and as organizational \nand societal members we seemed to be particularly susceptible to believing in it, even in \nthe absence of any scientific proof of its efficacy. However, Jim felt strongly that a \ncounter follower-centric emphasis was necessitated by the overwhelming dominance of \nleader-centric approaches in leadership research, pointing out that more radical follower-\ncentric perspectives were ultimately necessary to balance the equation. In sum, while Jim \nargued for the need to continually problematize the overarching emphasis on leaders to \nthe detriment of followers, we think he would have echoed Collinson\u201fs assertion that we \nneed more research to examine the \u201cmultiple, shifting, contradictory and ambiguous \nidentities of 'leaders' and 'followers'\u201d (Collinson, 2005, p. 1436).  \nAnother interesting area of theorizing and research surrounds the social \nconstruction of followership, and specifically the role that the dichotomization of \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 7 \nleadership and followership may play in romancing leaders. de Vries and van Gelder \n(2005) introduced the idea of implicit follower theories which can be linked to romance \nof leadership. Referring to Meindl\u201fs (1990, 1995) work, de Vries and van Gelder explain \nimplicit follower theories as a simplification of a complex world. They argue that \nfollowers will generally be perceived to have a high need for leaders and leadership (de \nVries, Roe, & Taillieu, 2002). This underlines Meindl\u201fs romance of leadership from an \nalternate perspective: In contrast to leaders, followers are seen as passive and dependent. \nThis way, the notion of the \u201ealmighty\u201f leader is supported and continually reinforced.   \nIn a similar vein, Uhl-Bien and Pillai (2006) suggest that a corollary to the \nromance of leadership may be the \u201esubordination of followership,\u201f and that this \nsubordination occurs through the social construction of what followership means. They \nexplore the meaning of followership relative to related concepts such as \u201csubordinate,\u201d \nimplicit theories of followership, and group-level social constructions, including social \ncontagion and emergent norms. Uhl-Bien and Pillai suggest that future research should \nexamine the ways in which individuals and groups enact followership, as well as the role \nof power distance in the social construction of followership. At the group level, for \nexample, the idea of followership may lead to the development of social norms of \nconformity and compliance with the leader and strong pressure to not speak up about \nissues. This construction of followership is based on fear, subordination, strong \nconceptions of hierarchy, and pressure to not take initiative or step outside the bounds of \nwhat it means to be a follower. Alternate constructions of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201ccourageous\u201d \nfollowership, in contrast, may focus more on the proactive role that followers may take in \nthe accomplishment of the group\u201fs or organization\u201fs goals. Clearly, future research is \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 8 \nnecessary to examine the implications of the social construction of followership, and how \nthis effect could potentially be amplified in cultures that are traditionally characterized as \nhaving high power distance. \nWhat are the factors associated with attributions of credit or blame to leaders in \norganizations? \nHierarchical status. Another interesting extension of the romance of leadership \nfocuses on attributions of causality relative to a hierarchical status and group \nmembership. Gibson and Schroeder\u201fs (2003) study on attributions of credit and blame \nprovides empirical and theoretical support for the notion that blame and credit are \nassigned differently depending on a leader\u201fs status in the organizational hierarchy, \nparticularly in conditions of causal ambiguity. Their results demonstrate that blame tends \nto rise in hierarchies: observers in their study tended to blame upper level management to \na greater degree than they blamed lower level employees for performance failures within \nthe organization. However, when assigning credit, observers made little differentiation \nbased on status. Contrary to the authors\u201f predictions, upper levels were not credited with \nsuccess to any greater degree than lower levels.  \nThe authors also found a significant interaction between blame and credit \nattributions and hierarchy, in that upper level positions receive higher blame than credit \nfor organizational events, while lower level positions receive higher credit than blame. \nGibson and Schroeder (2003) also found that observers attributed significantly lower \nlevels of credit and blame to groups than to individuals, although the manipulation of \ngroup versus individual attribution consisted solely of a change in labeling. This finding \nis consistent with social psychological research emphasizing that observers regard group \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 9 \nactions as less coherent, more diffuse, and less susceptible to internal attributions, \nresulting in lower attributions of responsibility than to individual leaders. Again, this \nresearch underlines the fact that the romance of leadership can be a double-edged sword \nfor leaders, with the potential to dichotomize leaders into heroes or villains based on \nrelatively little evidence beyond their position in the hierarchy, while equivalent \u201cgroups\u201d \nor \u201cteams\u201d remain less susceptible to this effect. \nLeader prototypicality and congeniality. Similarly, from Shamir\u201fs (1992) research \non the effect of prototypicality on the attribution of influence to a leader, we can conclude \nthat different types of leaders may be more susceptible to the romance of leadership. \nShamir found that participants attributed different degrees of influence to different types \nof leaders (one being more of a prototypical leader to his participants). It could be \ninteresting to expand this line of research: for example, is the romance of leadership more \npronounced when referring to certain types of leaders (e.g., sport coaches versus \nuniversity deans)? The underlying question that has yet to be addressed concerns what \nother variables or contextual factors may influence the different attributions of influence \nin the romance of leadership. For example, analogous to the findings of gender \ncongeniality of certain leadership roles (Eagly, Karau & Makhijani, 1995, p. 129), are \nthere certain leadership roles that are more congenial to the romance of leadership? Or \nare contextual factors, such as hierarchical role and leader-follower distance, equally or \nmore influential in shaping the attributions made? \nLeader-follower distance. Interestingly, we are unaware of any research that \nspecifically examines the role of leader-follower social distance (Shamir, 1995) on the \nromance of leadership. Given the evidence that the romance of leadership influences the \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 10 \nperception of an actual leader, the question arises, how might it influence the perception \nof a distant leader, a person most followers would hardly know? Collinson (2005) \nreviews a number of studies on leadership and distance that suggest the romance of \nleadership may be more likely in situations of greater distance. Specifically, Bogardus \n(1927) argued that social distance is fundamentally essential for leaders to maintain their \ninfluence and the respect of followers, and Katz and Kahn (1978) subsequently pointed \nout that top level leaders\u201f distance from followers allowed them to sustain a \u201esimplified \nand magical image\u201f more readily (cited in Collinson, 2005, p. 237).  \nThus, attributions of success or failure may be more likely in situations of greater \ndistance, where leaders can more readily maintain the persona of a \u201egreat\u201f leader with the \nability to control outcomes. Similarly, Shamir (2005) theorizes that the romance of \nleadership phenomenon may only apply to situations of high leader-follower distance, as \nleaders can more readily invoke attributions of success and failure through impression \nmanagement techniques, visionary rhetoric and behavior, and influencing organizational \nperformance cues. It is thus plausible that the tendency to romanticize leaders increases \nas the perceived social, interactional, physical, and geographical distance between leaders \nand followers increases (see Antonakis & Atwater, 2002). Followers with closer \nrelationships and interactions with their leaders are likely more privy to the situational \nand contextual constraints that leaders face, and may make more realistic attributions \nabout what leaders can and cannot influence. However, this proposition has yet to be \nempirically tested, suggesting an important question regarding the relationship between \nleadership romanticism and leader-follower distance. \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 11 \nThis assumption can be placed into the context of information processing as well. \nBasically, two sorts of information processing exist: automatic and controlled\/elaborated \ninformation processing (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). In \nautomatic information processing, individuals apply the information they have stored in \ntheir memory (e.g., stereotypes, implicit leadership theories) to a target (i.e., the \ninteraction partner; for the example of leadership see Lord, 1985; Medvedeff & Lord, \n2006). Although the application of stereotypes may lead to wrong conclusions about \nothers, it is a simple strategy to reduce cognitive load. Conversely, elaborate information \nprocessing, as it comprises gathering of information about a target, is more time \nconsuming but may lead to a more realistic picture of the respective target (i.e., the \nleader). We can expect that the more distant a leader and the less information about a \nleader available, the more implicit theories likely play a role in the perception of that \nleader. In addition, the motivation to gather information in order to gain an accurate \nimage of a leader may also be lower, as when a leader is distant little interaction is \nexpected. Consequently, distant leaders may be regarded with an even more romantic \nview than more proximal leaders. \n \nIs the tendency to attribute outcomes to leaders dispositional? What are the antecedents \nof the romance of leadership?  \nMeindl (1990) suggested that some individuals exhibit a dispositional tendency to \nattribute outcomes to leaders across situations; the Romance of Leadership Scale (RLS) \nwas developed to measure this tendency (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1988). According to Ehrlich, \nMeindl, and Viellieu (1990), persons with high scores on the RLS are more likely to \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 12 \nattribute responsibility for outcomes to leaders and perceive them as influential and \ncharismatic. Initial work on the scale found that dispositional factors such as locus of \ncontrol and age predicted RLS scores.  \nSurprisingly, very little research so far has focused on other personal antecedents \nof the romance of leadership. To our knowledge, only Felfe (2005) has examined \npersonality characteristics in their relationship to the romance of leadership. Assuming \nthat constructions of leadership may be similar or related to constructions of the self, \nFelfe examined the relationship between the Big-Five, as well as achievement, power and \naffiliation motives, self-efficacy, need for structure, and need for leadership and \nparticipants\u201f ratings on the Romance of Leadership Scale (RLS). He found that \noccupational self-efficacy, self-esteem, extraversion, conscientiousness and dominance \nare positively related to the romance of leadership, and neuroticism is negatively related \nto the romance of leadership. Participants\u201f tolerance for uncertainty, need for structure, \nand need for leadership were not related to the romance of leadership. This is, of course, \nonly a first step in examining the relationships among traditional personality variables \nand the romance of leadership.  \nWhile the romance of leadership has often been conceptualized as a dispositional \ntendency (see Awamleh & Gardner, 1999), Meindl (1995, p. 335) also emphasizes \npotential situational input factors for the romance of leadership, suggesting \u201cthe \nunderlying assumption is that certain contextual features, quite independently of the \npersonal attributes of followers, alter the nature of emergent leadership constructions.\u201d \nHe goes on to specify performance cues and perceptions of crisis as potentially relevant \nsituational factors. Therefore, additional research is necessary to uncover the extent to \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 13 \nwhich the romance of leadership represents a \u201cstate-like\u201d versus \u201ctrait-like\u201d tendency to \nattribute outcomes to leaders. Bligh, Kohles, and Pillai (2005) theorized that scores on the \nRLS could potentially be influenced by an individual\u201fs perceptions of a current state of \ncrisis. Their findings suggest that such a strong situational effect may override the \ndispositional tendencies (or lack thereof) to romanticize leadership. In other words, the \neffect of a situation may also strongly cue increased attributions of leadership, regardless \nof an individual\u201fs dispositional tendencies.  \nThus, additional research is necessary to explore whether or not the romance of \nleadership is more situationally influenced than Meindl originally theorized. In Awamleh \nand Gardner\u201fs (1999) study, as in the Bligh et al. (2005) study, situational performance \ncues were more influential in accounting for leadership outcomes than dispositional \nfactors measured by the RLS. Taken together, these results suggest that future research \nmay benefit from examining the extent to which scores on the RLS are impacted by \nvarious aspects of the situation. Specifically, situational and contextual influences might \nbe combined with longitudinal RLS measures to assess the extent to which different \nsituations create different degrees of follower tendencies to attribute positive and \nnegative performance outcomes to leadership. This line of research could increase our \nunderstanding of how aspects of the situation and followers\u201f dispositions potentially \ninteract to predict leadership attributions. \nIn terms of antecedents in general, other possible factors related to RLS scores \nmay be industry and occupational differences, cultural differences, and gender \ndifferences, to suggest a few examples. Similarly, the tendency to attribute outcomes to \nleadership may diminish over an individual\u201fs career tenure and as he or she reaches \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 14 \nhigher hierarchical levels within the organization, or gains accumulated experience with \nresource, role, and political constraints (see Stewart, 1976) that may temper or inhibit \ntheir belief in the personal efficacy of leaders. \nWhat effect does romanticizing leaders have on perceptions of actual leaders?  \nWhile few studies have examined antecedents of the romance of leadership, quite \na bit of research has focused on the question of how a romantic view of leadership \nimpacts the perception of actual leaders (e.g., Awamleh & Gardner, 1999). However, the \nresults of this research have so far been mixed. Meindl (1990) provides evidence that \nperceptions of charismatic leadership are likely to be greater in followers who attribute \noutcomes to leaders. Awamleh and Gardner (1999), however, found that the RLS was not \nsignificantly related to perceptions of leader charisma or effectiveness, providing no \nsupport for Meindl\u201fs (1990) assertion that generalized leadership beliefs account for \nvariance in perceptions of leadership. However, they state that \u201cMeindl\u201fs basic assertion \nthat people generally tend to romanticize leadership by overattributing organizational \noutcomes to leadership was supported\u201d (1999, p. 362). So, while some studies find a \npositive correlation between the romance of leadership and transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002; Awamleh, 2003; Meindl, 1990; Shamir, 1992), \nothers find no relationship at all (Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; Bligh et al., 2005; Schyns \n& Sanders, 2004). In addition, these same studies have reported varying results \nconcerning the relationship between the romance of leadership and leadership \neffectiveness. One prominent question therefore concerns whether or not we can more \nprecisely clarify why the results found across these various studies do not concur. In a \nrecent meta-analysis, Schyns, Felfe, and Blank (in press) found a positive relationship \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 15 \nbetween the romance of leadership and the perception of transformational \nleadership\/charisma. They examined whether the following variables could serve as \nmoderators of this relationship: Field\/employees vs. experimental\/student samples, region \nof origin, and type of assessment of transformational leadership. Region of origin proved \nto be a significant moderator in this study; however, due to outliers, there is need for \nfurther research to confirm this finding. A test of other potential moderators (such as the \ndispositional and situational variables discussed above) could help to shed light on when \nand under what circumstances there is a significant relationship between the romance of \nleadership and ratings of transformational\/charismatic leadership and leader \neffectiveness. \nIn addition, up until now, transformational\/charismatic leadership has been the \nprimary focus (perhaps in line with Meindl\u201fs (1990) assertion that the prevailing \nemphasis on transformational\/charismatic leadership represented a hyper-romanticization \nin itself). However, it would be interesting to examine how far the perception of other \nleadership styles could be affected by the romance of leadership as well. For example, \ncould there be a general tendency of individuals to regard leaders more positively on a \nwide variety of dimensions when they romanticize leaders? In other words, is there a \ngeneralized halo\/horns effect when individuals romanticize leadership, in that once \nleadership is established as the preferred explanation for either positive or negative \noutcomes, leaders are either anglicized or demonized accordingly? \nIn a similar vein, Gardner (2003) explored the following question: will individuals \nwho tend to romanticize leadership view a leader who is revealed to have a reputation for \nhonesty (deception) as more (less) morally worthy than other persons? In a test of this \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 16 \nmore \u201cfollower-driven\u201d perspective, the RLS was administered to ascertain the extent to \nwhich participants\u201f generalized leadership beliefs influenced their perceptions of \nleadership, including charisma and effectiveness. The findings suggest that high RLS \nindividuals perceived the leader to be most effective when delivery was strong and least \neffective when delivery was weak. As Meindl (1990) originally asserted, high RLS \nindividuals are inclined to infer strong leadership when exposed to evidence of high \nperformance and weak leadership when presented with evidence of low performance. In \ncontrast, the ratings of low RLS persons are not expected to vary as a function of \nperformance cues, as low RLS individuals (in general) assign less significance to \nleadership as a causal category. In Gardner\u201fs (2003) study, if strength of delivery is \nconsidered a performance cue, the reported interaction is consistent with Meindl's (1990) \npredictions. Thus, Gardner (2003) concludes the RLS is \u201ca potentially useful individual \ndifference variable that merits consideration when examining perceived \nleadership\u2026however, because the effects of RLS only emerged in combination with \nother factors, it is important for future researchers to search for meaningful RLS \ninteractions.\u201d \nHow does the romance of leadership influence attributions of charisma and augment the \nheroic status of leaders?   \nA number of important questions remain regarding the romance of leadership and \nthe phenomenon of charismatic or heroic leadership. Meindl et al. (1985, p. 78), \ndescribed the phenomenon of charisma as \u201celusive and enigmatic\u201d, suggesting that its \n\u201cdirect potency \u2026 on organizational outcomes has vastly outstripped reality.\u201d Meindl\u201fs \nperhaps healthy skepticism of charisma was rooted in his approach to charisma as a \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 17 \nsocially constructed, attributed phenomenon that had as much to do with the needs of \nfollowers to understand complex and ambiguous events as it had to do with actual \ncharismatic characteristics of the leader. Chen and Meindl (1991) pointed out that the \nromance of leadership was a powerful force in leading external observers, employees, \nand the media to create a romanticized and even heroic view of leaders. Tourigny, \nDougan, Washbush, and Clements (2003) subsequently suggest that the initial success of \nan organization can \u201cactually accelerate and empower efforts to construct a heroic image \nof a CEO.\u201d Performance cues are used to make attributions regarding the charismatic \nqualities of the CEO, and explanations that identify the leader as the cause of \norganizational outcomes serve to maintain a simplistic and idealistic perspective that \nhinders sound executive performance assessment (Chen & Meindl, 1991; Meindl et al., \n1985; Tourigny et al, 2003).  \nIn a similar vein, attributions of charisma increase the power of executives, as \nonce a CEO\u201fs image has been construed as positive, it can be resistant to change (Chen & \nMeindl, 1991), even if the leader is unlikely to be adaptive to changing environmental \nconditions (Conger & Kanungo, 1998). Consistent with the groupthink phenomenon \n(Janis, 1972), followers may subsequently filter cues accordingly, and leaders may \nmanipulate language and symbolism so as to maintain their power and manage political \nprocesses even in the face of evidence that contradicts their efficacy. Of course, there are \nalso numerous examples of highly positive leadership images that change quite \ndramatically (e.g., politicians Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, CEOs Bernie Ebbers of \nWorldCom, Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco International, and Richard Scrushy of \nHealthSouth). These quite drastic changes in the public\u201fs perception of the leader may \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 18 \noccur in part precisely because of the initial tendency for followers to romanticize them, \nleading to greater disappointment and disillusionment as the leader cannot possibly live \nup to followers\u201f expectations in the long term. According to Tourigny et al. (2003), \ndysfunctional behavior of leaders may be strongly influenced by and enabled by \npotentially dysfunctional behaviors on the part of followers as well (see also Clements & \nWashbush, 1999). In addition, from an ethical standpoint, the charismatic leader who can \nuse imagery to enhance his or her mystical status and engage in impression management \ntactics can shift attention away from controversial ethical issues toward more socially \ndesirable ends (such as profitability). Unless a major (and visible) ethical breach is \nuncovered, decisions made and the means used by leaders will not be investigated, \nthereby partially contributing to potentially unethical and illegitimate actions (Elsbach & \nSutton, 1992). However, when major ethical breaches are revealed, the public backlash is \noften immediate and decisive. \nOther researchers have explored the phenomena that charismatic leaders may be \nmore likely to rise to prominence during a crisis (Beyer, 1999, Pillai & Meindl, 1991; \nBligh, Kohles, & Meindl 2004). Charismatic leaders are often portrayed as prospective \nsaviors or \u201cwhite knights\u201d promising to extricate an organization, social group, or nation \nfrom disaster (Bligh et al., 2005; Shamir, House, & Arthur, 1993). As they take power, \nthey may express confidence and articulate a vision necessary for an organization\u201fs \nturnaround. Yet, charismatic leaders may also benefit from the romance of leadership: \nUnder pressure, followers\u201f need for causal explanations (with both explanatory and \npredictive power) increases in an attempt to reduce feelings of ambiguity and uncertainty \n(Tourish & Pinnington, 2002). As Gemmill and Oakley (1992, p. 115) point out, \u201cas \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 19 \nsocial despair and helplessness deepen, the search and wish for a Messiah (leader) or \nmagical rescue (leadership) also begins to accelerate.\u201d  \nFlynn and Staw (2004) suggest that followers\u201f attributions of charisma are often \nvalidated, at least in part, because an organization has successfully passed through a crisis \nperiod, even though there may be scant evidence that the change in organizational \noutcomes is due to the actions of the leader. Nonetheless, because of these overattribution \nprocesses, charismatic leaders may be perceived as \u201esuperhuman\u201f by followers (Deluga, \n1995), given credit for events and outcomes they have not originated or even materially \ninfluenced.  \nIn sum, Flynn and Staw (2004) argue that the power of charismatic leaders to \nguide and influence members of an organization during difficult times may be only \u201chalf \nthe story.\u201d Equally important may be external factors, such as the restoration of outsiders\u201f \nconfidence in the organization. Through the use of strategic accounts and persuasion \ntactics, charismatic leaders may manipulate negative impressions that outsiders hold of an \norganization. Further, the mere presence of a leader who is deemed \u201ccharismatic\u201d may \nremove collective doubts about the survival of a firm. Instead of critically evaluating the \nprospects of a firm, outside constituents may often simply accept the charismatic leader\u201fs \nhopes for the future (Willner, 1983). As a result, the promises of the charismatic leader \nmay be accepted \u201cnot because of [their] rational likelihood of success . . . but because of \nan effective belief in the extraordinary qualities of the leader\u201d (Dow, 1969: 315), \nproviding more evidence for the romance of leadership.  \nThrough two separate studies, Flynn and Harris (2004) provide empirical \nevidence that in its extreme, a charismatic appeal appears to be capable of converting \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 20 \nperceptions of an economically difficult situation into perceptions of a positive situation. \nThey suggest that although the majority of charismatic leadership research has focused on \nthe attitudes and behavior of followers inside the organization, the romance of leadership \nperspective may also be applied to the symbolic actions and consequences of charismatic \nleadership that may be equally powerful beyond the borders of the organization. In other \nwords, part of the effect of the charismatic leader may be due to that individual\u201fs ability \nto secure resources from outside of the firm, simply due to his or her charismatic \nreputation and the tendency for outsiders to (mis)attribute efficacy to the leader. \nHow does the romance of leadership affect followers\u2019 expectations and performance \nevaluations of leaders? \nA highly romanticized view of leaders may also affect the expectations an \nindividual has of his or her actual leader. Attributing all responsibility of company \nperformance to leaders and seeing them as \u201cpowerful and almighty\u201d may lead to \nexaggerated expectations when it comes to a leader using his or her influence for the \nbenefit of individual employees. As a result, disappointments may be inevitable. An \ninteresting study might focus on the effects of unrealistic expectations on the actual \nrelationship development and cooperation between leader and follower, combining \nresearch on the romance of leadership with the longstanding research stream examining \nleader-member exchange (LMX). As leader-follower relationships often develop over \ntime based on reciprocity and mutual trust (Sullivan, Mitchell, & Uhl-Bien, 2003; \nSanders & Schyns, 2006), followers with a high tendency to attribute outcomes to leaders \nmay \u2013 in response to their frustrated (and often unrealistic) expectations \u2013 refrain from \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 21 \ncooperating and may even in the end turn to destructive behaviors such as mockery, \nresistance, or outright sabotage.  \nWe do not mean to suggest, however, that such follower resistance is necessarily \ndestructive, or that all followers would necessary engage in negative resistance. In fact, \nfollower resistance and reactions to the romance of leadership may take highly \nconstructive forms as well, such as voice behaviors, upward influence tactics, or \nsportsmanship and helping behaviors. In fact, taking a broader view that appreciates the \npotential importance of follower resistance may suggest that follower romanticism might \nbe much less pervasive and automatic than the 'romance thesis' sometimes implies. For \nexample, leader impression management techniques may be much less effective in \nsecuring follower consent and commitment than is often assumed, an important area for \nfuture research. \nSchyns (2006) proposes an effect of mismatch between supervisors\u201f and \nfollowers\u201f implicit leadership theories and their perception of a leader; specifically, to the \nextent this mismatch occurs, evaluations of the leader\u201fs performance and promotion \nrecommendations are likely to be negatively impacted. Besides the negative effects that \nthe romance of leadership may have on cooperation with a leader or development of a \nhigh exchange relationship as outlined above, disappointed followers may also devaluate \ntheir leaders in 360 degree feedback, if they turn out not to be \u201ealmighty\u201f after all. As \nBradley, Allen, Hamilton, & Filgo (2006) point out, leadership ratings are based, at least \nin part, on followers\u201f perceptual processes and the match between a perceived leadership \nschema and the individual being rated (Lord & Maher, 1991), and are potentially strongly \ninfluenced by social contagion processes (Borman, 1974; Meindl, 1995). As a result, \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 22 \nfuture research should include the romance of leadership as a potential factor in \nleadership evaluations, particularly in the realm of charismatic and transformational \nleaders. \nHow does the romance of leadership relate to individual or team performance? \nRelated to the question of the effect of the romance of leadership on cooperation, \nleader-member exchange relationships, and ratings of leader performance is the question \nof how the romance of leadership influences the performance of individual followers or \ngroups of followers. Judge and Bono\u201fs (2001) meta-analysis shows that internal locus of \ncontrol is slightly positively related to performance. With respect to the romance of \nleadership, we might assume an even stronger effect if individuals not only attribute \nexternally but specifically to a leader and \u201cleadership.\u201d As highly romanticizing followers \nwith an external locus of control may expect that their performance has little or any \nimpact on overall company performance, their efforts to contribute may be limited. \nUltimately and in line with their own expectations, followers will then likely have lower \nindividual performance. This could suggest that the romance of leadership may be \nnegatively related to individual or group performance. On the other hand, the romance of \nleadership might also work as a positive self-fulfilling prophecy in organizations. \nSpecifically, highly romanticizing followers may exert high effort (consciously or \nunconsciously) in order to make the leaders successful in line with their own \nexpectations. This idea is similar to the so-called Pygmalion effect (Rosenthal & \nJacobson, 1968; for an application to leadership see Eden, 1990): High expectations may \nlead to high performance ratings of the leader and supportive behaviors that enhance \nperformance possibilities and, over time, may lead to higher performance. Given these \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 23 \ntwo contradictory assumptions and the lack of research in this area, the impact of the \nromance of leadership on performance is an interesting topic for future research. \nIs there a shared romance of leadership in highly cohesive teams?  \nPastor\u201fs (1998) study demonstrates that individuals working closely together \nconstruct leadership in social processes. He viewed \u201cindividuals\u201f representations of \nleadership [\u2026] as cognitive networks composed of leadership and organizational \nconcepts\u201d (p. ii). In his empirical study, he indeed found that social networks (informal \nrelationships between members) are positively related to the similarity in individuals\u201f \ncognitive structures. In other words, we can say that the more employees are informally \nrelated to each other, the more likely they are to share a common view on leadership. In \nhighly cohesive teams, for example, members may over time develop a shared or team-\nlevel approach to the romance of leadership.  \nAlthough there is very little existing empirical research on shared romance of \nleadership, we can draw on established theories, such as social identity theory (SIT) \n(Tajfel, 1982; see also Haslam, 2004) to outline some preliminary research questions and \nhypotheses. A key feature of social identity theory is that a person\u201fs identity consists \nlargely of his or her \u201cknowledge that he [or she] belongs to certain social groups, together \nwith some emotional and value significance to him [or her] of the group membership\u201d \n(Tajfel, 1982, p. 31). In order for individuals to identify themselves as a member of a \ngroup, the membership in that group has to be salient (Turner, Oakes, Haslam, & \nMcGarty, 1994). Belonging to a team at work is often salient in that sense that everybody \nreporting to the same leader is often by definition a member of a particular team. \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 24 \nHowever, in order for one\u201fs social identity to be drawn from this team membership, \nindividuals within the same group must perceive similarity to the other group members.  \nGiven the significance of the leader in often defining the group\u201fs function and \nmembership in the first place, we can assume that views towards leadership are one \nimportant criterion for perceived similarity. Every team member likely has an opinion \nabout leadership on an explicit level (concerning the specific leader of the group) and an \nimplicit level (concerning implicit leadership theories). Consequently, the extent to which \nthe group develops a shared social construction of leadership can become a significant \naspect of the group\u201fs identity, and facilitate increased communication and performance. \nAlternately, the direction of the relationship can also be reversed: The more salient the \ngroups\u201f social identity, the more likely a shared view on leadership may develop (see \nHaslam et al., 2001, for this argument). We might thus predict that the lower the variance \nin the romance of leadership in a team, or to the extent that the tendency to romanticize \nleadership is shared, the higher the cohesion and satisfaction of team members, possibly \nresulting in higher performance.  \nAre other organizational concepts susceptible to a \u201cromance\u201d effect?  \nThe 'romance of teams' concept. Borrowing the term from Meindl et al. (1985), \nAllen and Hecht (2004) introduced the \u201eromance of teams\u201f concept, arguing that people \ntend to assume teams are 'high performance' even despite evidence to the contrary. \nTherefore, they argued that there is also a 'romance of teams' in organizations, which they \ndefined as \u201ca faith in the effectiveness of team-based work that is not supported by, or is \neven inconsistent with, relevant empirical evidence.\u201d  Despite the semantic similarities, \nboth Meindl (2004) and West, Brodbeck, and Richter (2004) argue that this concept \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 25 \ndiffers significantly from the original romance of leadership concept. The romance of \nleadership builds on the social psychology of attribution theory to explain how \nindividuals make causal inferences, suggesting that leadership plays an important part in \nthe way people attempt to make sense out of organizationally relevant phenomena. \nThrough this sense-making process, leadership has assumed a romanticized, \u201elarger-than-\nlife\u201f role, in that people frequently overestimate the impact of leadership, and most \nstrongly when identifying potential causes for extraordinary high and low performance. \nIn contrast, West et al. (2004) suggest that Allen and Hecht's (2004) 'romance of teams' \nconcept refers solely to peoples\u201f general tendencies to have positive views about team \nperformance. However, it remains an open question as to whether leadership occupies a \nunique niche in followers\u201f attribution processes, or whether there are other organizational \nphenomena that may be subject to a \u201cromance\u201d effect as well. \nSummary and Directions for Future Research \n \nResearch into the romance of leadership now has an established history of over 20 \nyears. It is safe to say that the phenomenon itself is an important and pervasive aspect of \norganizations, as demonstrated by research programs in different areas, countries, and \ncontexts. However, this brief review of existing literature suggests that quite a few \nquestions remain unanswered. In the following section, we summarize some unanswered \nquestions that may serve to stimulate future research. \nContext and boundary conditions. A number of questions surrounding the \nromance of leadership refer to the influence of situation and context: For example, \nbeyond trait or personality characteristics, what are the situational and contextual \nvariables that influence our tendency to romanticize leaders and leadership? Which of \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 26 \nthese variables moderate the relationship between the romance of leadership and the \nperception of transformational leadership\/charisma? It appears likely that hierarchy and \nperceived social distance of leaders in question enhances the romance of leadership, but \nthese questions, as well as those concerning whether the romance of leadership is more \npronounced in certain areas or domains (e.g., politics, sports, types of industries) have yet \nto be addressed. It may well be that in some areas and cultures the romance of leadership \nis more prevalent as more importance is attributed to leadership than in other contexts \nand cultures.  \nThe romance of leadership and followership. In addition, although the romance of \nleadership is a follower-centered approach and recent research (de Vries & van Gelder, \n2005; Uhl-Bien & Pillai, 2006) has turned to the role of the social construction of \nfollowership, an interesting issue would be to examine the interaction between the two: \nDoes the social construction of followership follow the construction of leadership or \u2013 in \nother words \u2013 does the romance of leadership lead to a diminished attribution of influence \nto followers and decreased appreciation for their contributions? \nFinally, one of the largest remaining issues in romance of leadership research is \nthe lack of focus on outcomes. In this paper, we have identified numerous potential \noutcomes that warrant further research, such as: \na) Cooperation between leaders and followers; \nb) Leaders\u201f performance evaluations; \nc) Promotion of leaders; \nd) Team and individual performance; and \ne) Follower identity. \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 27 \nOverall, we argue that although research on the romance of leadership has \nestablished itself as an important and fruitful area of scholarship in its own right, it is \nclear that work in this area has only just begun. The continuing interest in this \nphenomenon underlines its importance, and the time is ripe for more romance of \nleadership research due to the wide acceptance of followers\u201f role in the leadership \nprocess in current scholarship. Therefore, we hope this paper will encourage future \nresearchers to continue to focus on this promising \u201calternative to contemporary wisdom\u201d \n(Meindl, 1990, p. 159), and further delineate the antecedents, contextual factors, and \noutcomes associated with our common desire as individuals and as collectives to \nsteadfastly believe in the power and efficacy of leadership. \nLeading questions: Romance of Leadership \n 28 \nReferences \n \nAl-Dmour, H., & Awamleh, R.
