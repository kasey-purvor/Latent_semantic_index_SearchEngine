Oxford \nUniversity Press, Oxford. (ISBN 0-19-924875-3) \n \nThis book presents (some of the) research undertaken as part of a \u00a33 million \nESRC funded programme: Virtual society? The social science of electronic technologies \n(http:\/\/virtualsociety.sbs.ox.ac.uk).  The programme took an avowedly sceptical \nview of the internet and other electronic technologies and drew on key ideas and \ninsights from the social sciences with the aim of moving beyond the hyperbole \nthat is often found in this area. \n \nIn many cases, a \u201cbook of a programme\u201d runs the risk that there is limited \ncoherence between the chapters.  To address this, in the opening chapter, \nWoolgar proposes five \u2018rules\u2019 of virtuality that arise from the many \u201ccounter-\nintuitive\u201d results reported by the programme: \n\u2022 The uptake and use of the new technologies depend crucially on local \nsocial context; \n\u2022 The fears and risks associated with new technologies are unevenly socially \ndistributed; \n\u2022 Virtual technologies supplement rather than substitute for real activities; \n\u2022 The more virtual the more real; \n\u2022 The more global the more local. \n \nThe remaining chapters of the book present summaries of the research \nundertaken by various projects and it is in this area that the book, as opposed to \nthe underlying programme, is at its weakest. \n \nAs a researcher interested in the social study of information technology, I failed \nto see that the many results were as \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d as claimed; indeed, they \ntypically provided further empirical support for fairly straightforward academic \nclaims (I find it a useful test to try negating such claims to see if they are realistic \npropositions: for example, is any social scientist likely to hypothesise that uptake \nand use of new technologies doesn\u2019t depend crucially on local factors?). \n \nAmongst the most interesting chapters for me were those that overlapped areas \nof concern in my own discipline (information systems), particularly the chapters \nby Knights et al., McGrail, Mason et al., Brown and Lightfoot and Hughes et al on \norganisational transformation , surveillance, e\u2013mail and standardisation.  It was \nalso very apparent from these chapters, however, that they were generally very \nmuch stuck in their own literatures on technology, society and organisations, \nrather than drawing on the many other perspectives that exist in these areas.  \nAgreed, the worst of this broader literature is uncritical management hype, but \nthere is also much well written material there.  To illustrate the extent of this \nproblem, I found fewer than 30 references, amongst the 26 pages of references, to \njournals in information systems and management that could have provided \nuseful insights onto the issues these projects were researching. \n \nThe programme was funded by a UK social science funding body and as a result, \nmost of the research is (understandably) UK based; nevertheless given the topic \nand the social science focus I was struck by a number of important missing \ntopics.  Thus whilst there is some discussion of globalisation, there is little talk of \ngender (one reference in the index) of race or of identity (not listed at all in the \nindex), despite these being topics that are widely acknowledged by social \nscientists as being affected by electronic technologies. \n  \nAnother conspicuous absence from the book is any consistent consideration of \ntheorising; what the reader is given is empirical data and countless reminders \nthat the data illustrate several of Woolgar\u2019s rules of virtuality.  There are few \nattempts to step up from the data to draw broader conclusions.  When theorising \ndoes occur, as in the superb chapter by Agar et al. and, to a lesser extent, in \nStrathern\u2019s closing piece, the difference in quality is immediately apparent. \n \nOverall, therefore, the book is quite useful for those looking into the social \nscience of electronic technologies, but for true insights and theoretical \ncontributions, unfortunately, it is best to look elsewhere. \n \n \nDr. Edgar A.
