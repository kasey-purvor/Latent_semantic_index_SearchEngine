An understanding of past magnitudes and\nrates of climate change is fundamental for putting the\npresent into context and making realistic predictions about\nthe future.\nHowever, to date there have been few attempts at\nreconstructing past climate change at Macquarie Island, and\nmore generally in the region between 40\u2013658S. This is\nsurprising as Macquarie Island is well placed to respond to\nchanges in rainfall, temperature and westerly wind patterns\nassociated with changes in the thermal gradient between\ntemperate and polar latitudes, the position of the Polar\nFrontal Zone and sea ice extent.\nMacquarie Island contains numerous lakes and ponds,\nmany of which accumulate sediments that archive a record\nof past environmental conditions. Unlocking this record\ncan be achieved through palaeolimnological studies.\nDiatoms are one of the key tools used in these studies as\nthey respond to a wide range of environmental variables\nincluding nutrients, pH, conductivity and temperature\n(Stoermer & Smol 1999). Quantitative methods have been\ndeveloped to relate diatom species assemblages to specific\nenvironmental variables (i.e. diatom-based transfer functions).\nWith these transfer functions, sub-fossil diatom assemblages\nin lake sediment cores can be used to reconstruct past\nenvironmental conditions and can be applied to investigations\nof recent climate change and human impacts (see Battarbee\net al. 2001).\nHigh-latitude diatom-based transfer functions have\npreviously been developed for inferring nutrients (e.g. Lim\net al. 2007), salinity (e.g. Verleyen et al. 2003, Sabbe et al.\n2004, Hodgson et al. 2006), pH (e.g. Jones & Birks 2004),\nchlorophyll a (e.g. Jones & Juggins 1995), temperature\n(e.g. Kumke et al. 2004, Gremmen et al. 2007) and soil\nmoisture content (e.g. Van de Vijver et al. 2002a). To date,\nwith the exception of Van de Vijver et al. (2002a) and\nGremmen et al. (2007), there are no diatom-based transfer\nfunctions from the sub-Antarctic despite good evidence\nthat the composition of diatom assemblages in this region\nis strongly influenced by environmental gradients (e.g. Van\nde Vijver et al. 2002b, 2004).\nThe relationships between diatom community\ncomposition and environmental variables on Macquarie\nIsland have not yet been fully explored. In this paper we\n35\nAntarctic Science 21 (1), 35\u201349 (2009) & Antarctic Science Ltd 2009 Printed in the UK doi:10.1017\/S0954102008001442\npresent new data from lakes and ponds on Macquarie Island\nand quantify the relationships between surface sediment\ndiatom assemblages and present day environmental\nconditions. These relationships are then used to develop\ndiatom-based transfer functions that will be applied to\nfuture studies of environmental change on the island.\nStudy area\nMacquarie Island (54830\u2019S, 158857\u2019E) is located just north of\nthe Polar Front, 1500 km south-east of Tasmania, 1200 km\nsouth-west of New Zealand and 1300 km from the\nAntarctic continent (Fig. 1). It is 34 km long, 5 km at its\nwidest and has an area of 120 km2.\nFig. 1. a. Location of Macquarie Island, situated south of New Zealand and Australia, and north of Antarctica, b. Location of sampling sites,\nc. looking north from the south-west coast of Macquarie Island, illustrating the coastal terrace and plateau that characterizes the island, and\nd. looking south down the western side of the plateau.

SAUNDERS et al.36\nThe island experiences a cool, wet and windy oceanic\nclimate with small annual and diurnal variations in\ntemperature. The weather is dominated by westerly to\nnorth-westerly winds, with a mean annual wind speed of\n~30 km hr-1, reaching gale forces of up to 170 km hr-1.\nMean annual precipitation is 920 mm and it rains . 300\ndays per year (BOM 2007, www.bom.gov.au\/weather\/tas\/\nmacquarie\/). Due to almost constant cloud cover, light\nlevels are generally low, with a mean annual average of 2.2\nhours of sunshine per day (BOM 2007). Mean temperature\nranges between 4.98C in winter and 8.88C in summer, with\na daily variation of ~3.58C (BOM 2007). Since continuous\nmeteorological observations began in 1949, mean surface\nair temperature has increased by 0.38C degrees (Tweedie &\nBergstrom 2000).\nGeologically, Macquarie Island is a rare example of\nuplifted oceanic crust that is part of the Macquarie Ridge\nComplex, which runs south from New Zealand (Davis\n1988). Faulting, uplift, sea level changes, erosion and\nperiglacial processes have been the major factors shaping\nMacquarie Island and its lakes. While the occurrence of\npast glacial activity has been debated, it is now believed\nthat glaciation did not play a significant role in shaping the\ncurrent landscape (Selkirk et al. 1990), although it is still\ndebatable if permanent snow and ice accumulated in some\nareas during the Last Glacial Maximum (McGlone 2002).\nThe island consists of a steep sided (generally 20\u2013408)\nnarrow plateau, rising directly from the coast or raised\nbeach terraces and averages 250\u2013300 m above sea level,\nwith its highest point at 433 m. Macquarie Island is\nextensively vegetated with tussock grasslands, herbs and\nsedges, areas of peat, mosses, liverworts and lichens, and\nthere are no trees (Fig. 1).\nThe island is also home to abundant wildlife, providing a\nvital refuge and important breeding ground in a region of\nsparse landmasses. In recognition of its geological and\nwildlife attributes, Macquarie Island has been designated as\na Sanctuary (1933), a Tasmanian State Reserve (1978),\nWorld Heritage Area (1997) and United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Biosphere\nReserve (the only Biosphere Reserve in the sub-Antarctic\nbiogeographic region). The adjacent seas are designated as a\nMarine Park and form the second largest Marine Protected\nArea in the world. Nevertheless, human impacts on the\nisland have been significant since its discovery in 1810.\nEarly interest in the island was purely commercial, based on\nexploitation of penguin and seal resources (Davis 1988).\nDuring this period a number of alien vertebrate species were\nintroduced including cats (Felis catus, 1820s), European\nrabbits (Orycolagus cuniculus, 1870s), weka (Galliralluss\naustralis scotti, 1870s), house mice (Mus musculus, 1890s)\nand ship rats (Rattus rattus, 1900) (Copson & Whinam\n2001). In 1919 the commercial exploitation of penguins\nand seals was terminated (Brothers & Copson 1988), but\nintroduced species continue to threaten its fragile habitats\nand conservation status. Cats and weka have recently been\neradicated (2000 and 1989 respectively, PWS 2007), but\nthis has intensified damage by rabbits, particularly through\nvegetation disturbance and erosion.\nThe island is characterized by abundant shallow and deep\nponds and lakes. Oceanic spray is the principal source of ions\nto the lakes, with geochemical weathering playing a minor\nrole (Buckney & Tyler 1974). The ion chemistry of the\nlakes is influenced by the prevailing westerly winds and\ndistance from the ocean, and seasonal variation in chemical\ncomposition is small (Buckney & Tyler 1974, Bryden 1988).\nMethods\nData collection\nFifty-eight sites in 50 ponds and lakes on the coastal terrace and\nplateauwere sampled during a sixweek period fromFebruary\u2013\nApril 2006. These sites include most ponds and lakes on\nMacquarie Island. The largest four lakes were sampled at two\nlocations (at the western and eastern sides) to try and account\nfor spatial variability in nutrients and conductivity. At each\nsite, surface sediment samples (top 1 cm) were collected from\nc. 1 m water depth using a hand-operated gravity corer (Glew\n1991). While there are a few deep lakes on Macquarie Island,\nmost are shallow and only 1\u20132 m deep. Consequently,\nsamples were collected from c. 1 m depth throughout the\nsampling campaign. At each site, surface water conductivity,\ndissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and turbidity were\nmeasured using a Hydrolab Datasonde 4a. Duplicate water\nsamples were collected for soluble reactive phosphate (SRP),\nnitrate\/nitrite and silicate analyses. Sample tubes were rinsed\nseveral times in lake water at each site prior to collection.\nSamples for nutrient analysis were frozen as soon as possible\nafter collection and analysed using an Alpkem Autoanalyzer\n(Continuous Flow Solution Analyzer) at the Commonwealth\nScientific and Industrial Research Organization Marine and\nAtmospheric Laboratories, Hobart, in May 2006. The\nautoanalyser uses the principles of colorimetric analysis in a\ncontinuous flow system with all manipulations of the samples\nautomated. Each analytical channel was calibrated using\nstandards of known concentration (Eriksen 1997).\nDiatom analysis\nDiatom samples were prepared using standard methods\n(Battarbee et al. 2001). At least 400 frustules were counted\nper sample, using phase contrast and oil immersion at 1000x\nmagnification on a Zeiss Z20 light microscope. The relative\nabundance of all species (including unidentified forms) was\nrecorded as a percentage of the total number of frustules\ncounted (Battarbee et al. 2001). Taxonomy was principally\nbased on sub-Antarctic (e.g. Van de Vijver et al. 2002b),\nAntarctic (i.e. Roberts & McMinn 1999) and Australian\ntaxonomic literature (e.g. Vyverman et al. 1995, Hodgson\nMACQUARIE ISLAND DIATOMS 37\net al. 1997). All taxa were photographed and are archived,\nincluding taxonomic data, with the first author. A final\nspecies list (of 129 species) was developed including only\nthose species occurring with \u0002 1% relative abundance.\nStatistical analyses\nMultivariate statistical analyses were used to identify major\nenvironmental gradients in the dataset, explore diatom-\nenvironment relationships and identify environmental\nvariables that explained independent portions of the\nvariance in the diatom data. Simple Weighted Averaging\n(WA) was used to determine species\u2019 ecological\npreferences (i.e. optima and tolerances) for these\nenvironmental variables and, together with Weighted\nAveraging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS), was used to\ndevelop transfer functions.\nPrior to statistical analyses, each environmental variable\nwas checked for skewness, and nutrients and turbidity were\nlog(x \u00fe 1) transformed. Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) was performed on the environmental data to\ndetermine the major environmental gradients. Detrended\nCorrespondence Analysis (DCA) with detrending by\nsegments and downweighting of rare species was\nperformed on the species data (untransformed) to establish\nwhether species distribution was unimodal or linear. As\ngradient lengths were greater than 2 standard deviation\nunits, unimodal ordination techniques were used. Species\ndata were log(x \u00fe 1) transformed for subsequent analyses.\nA series of Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA)\nwere performed with scaling focused on inter-species\ndistances, biplot scaling and downweighting of rare\nspecies. Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) were identified\nand any environmental variables with VIFs . 20 were\nremoved. CCAs with forward selection and Monte Carlo\nTable I.

(Continued)\nMACQUARIE ISLAND DIATOMS 43\nDiscussion\nThe aims of this study were to investigate diatom\nassemblages in surface sediment samples from lakes on\nMacquarie Island, relate them to present-day environmental\nconditions and develop transfer functions for selected\nenvironmental variables. This has revealed new insights\ninto the major limnological patterns on the island and the\necological preferences of diatoms on Macquarie Island\nacross a range of environmental variables.\nLimnology\nThe lakes analysed in this study are all freshwater. There is a\nwide range of nutrient concentrations ranging from mostly\noligotrophic lakes on the plateau to eutrophic lakes on the\ncoastal terrace. There are similar wide ranges in dissolved\noxygen, pH, temperature and turbidity. Eutrophic lakes and\nponds commonly occur along the coastlines of sub-\nAntarctic and maritime Antarctic islands (e.g. Jones et al.\n1993, Van de Vijver & Beyens 1999). These lakes and\nFig. 4.

Grey lines represent different zones within the\nenvironmental gradients. Species abundances are represented as % relative abundance. (Continued)\nKRYSTYNA M. SAUNDERS et al.44\nponds can be highly eutrophic, reaching greater than 1000 lg\nP L-1 and 1000 lg N L-1 (e.g. Ile de la Possession, Van de\nVijver & Beyens 1999, and this study, Table I). Seals,\npenguins and seabirds are considered to contribute\nsignificant amounts of nutrients and the highest SRP and\nnitrate\/nitrite values recorded in this study were near seal\nor penguin colonies.\nPCA of the environmental data shows that in addition to the\ninfluence of conductivity detected byBuckney&Tyler (1974),\nthe lakes are also organized along gradients of nutrients and\nturbidity, and to a lesser extent, pH and dissolved oxygen\n(Fig. 2). CCA with geographical and physical factors plotted\nas passive variables demonstrates the influence of distance\nfrom the west coast and the importance of the prevailing\nweather characteristics on conductivity, nutrients, pH and\ntemperature (Fig. 5). With increasing distance from the west\ncoast, these environmental variables decrease. All of the\npassive variables are highly correlated with each other,\nwhich is not surprising due to the westerly weather patterns\nthat dominate the climate of Macquarie Island and the\nabsence of lakes on the eastern coastal terrace.\nEcological preferences of diatom communities\non Macquarie Island\nThe frequency distribution of selected taxa in the dataset\nprovides examples of how individual species abundances\nrespond to selected environmental variables (Fig. 6). This,\ntogether with clear transitions in species abundance and\noccurrence (Fig. 4), highlights the large limnological\ngradients in the lakes on Macquarie Island and allows\npotential indicator species to be identified.\nDiatom taxa characteristic of higher nutrient and\nconductivity concentrations include Planothidium\ndelicatulum and Cyclotella meneghiniana (Figs 4, 5 & 7).\nThese are both cosmopolitan species and Planothidium\ndelicatulum has previously been found on the Antarctic\ncontinent, and Macquarie, Kerguelen, South Orkney and\nSouth Shetland islands (Van de Vijver et al. 2002b).\nCyclotella meneghiniana has previously been found on Ile\nde la Possession by Van de Vijver & Beyens (1999) when\nnutrient enrichment was sufficient and is common in\neutrophic systems elsewhere (Weckstro\u00a8m & Juggins 2006).\nThis appears to be the case in this study as well, as\nCyclotella meneghinina was most abundant at a coastal site\nwith high SRP and nitrate\/nitrite (i.e. SRP. 2000 lg P L-1,\nnitrate\/nitrite. 1900 lg N L-1, Table I). Planktonic species\nare generally absent from Antarctic diatom assemblages\n(Jones et al. 1993), apart from some brackish to marine\nlakes in the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, where the\ndiatom flora includes planktonic marine and sea ice\ndiatoms (Verleyen et al. 2003). The general absence of\nplanktonic diatom taxa in sub-Antarctic lakes is in contrast\nto lakes in temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere,\nFig. 4.

Species abundances are represented as % relative abundance.\nMACQUARIE ISLAND DIATOMS 45\nwhere planktonic diatoms often dominate (Van de Vijver &\nBeyens 1999).\nAulacoseira distans, like Cyclotella meneghiniana, is a\ntychoplanktonic species that featured widely in this dataset,\nbut only in inland lakes. It has also been identified on King\nGeorge Island, South Georgia, lles Kerguelen and Crozet,\nand Ile de la Possession (Van de Vijver et al. 2002b). This\nis a heavily silicified species that needs water turbulence\nand\/or high water levels to maintain suspension in the\nwater column. A high or increasing abundance of\nAulacoseira distans in diatom assemblages may indicate\nincreased mixing intensity or lake level (Ko\u00a8ster et al. 2004).\nPsammothidium abundans is a benthic diatom associated\nwith prostrate microbial mats (Verleyen et al. 2003).\nDiatom communities characteristic of low nutrient and\nconductivity conditions on Macquarie Island include\nEunotia paludosa, which is characteristic of freshwaters\nelsewhere and is acidophilous, and Navicula sp. 1 and\nUnknown sp. 1, which have both been found elsewhere in\nthe sub-Antarctic, but have yet to be fully identified and\ndescribed (Bart Van de Vijver personal communication\n2007).\nEvaluation of transfer functions\nBased on the dataset, statistically robust transfer functions for\nconductivity, SRP and silicate were developed (Table IX).\nThe best performing transfer function models used simple\nWA for conductivity and SRP, and WAPLS-2 components\nfor silicate. The WAPLS model for silicate may have\nFig. 5.

Frequency distribution of selected abundant diatom taxa in\nthe Macquarie Island reference dataset along the conductivity,\npH, silicate, soluble reactive phosphate and temperature\ngradients.\nKRYSTYNA M. SAUNDERS et al.46\nperformed better than simple WA due to a reduction in the\n\u2018edge effect\u2019 (i.e. the underestimation of optima at the high\nend and overestimation at the low end of the gradient,\nBirks 1998) and the presence of more than one important\nenvironmental variable in the dataset (Verleyen et al.\n2003). The distribution of species occurrence in the dataset\nillustrates the clear transitions in the dataset between species\nand changes in the concentration of each variable (Fig. 4).\nThe transfer functions for pH and temperature had relatively\npoor predictive performance (Table IX). This is surprising as\nthere is a long, relatively well-populated pH gradient in the\ndataset. However, the diatoms seem to be pre-adapted to\nwide pH gradients and do not show the limited tolerances\nthat are necessary to develop strong transfer functions. This\nis illustrated in the plot of diatom species occurrences along\nthe pH gradient in the dataset: while some species only\noccur at low and high pH, most occur throughout the pH\ngradient (Fig. 4). Similarly, the diatom-temperature transfer\nfunction performed poorly, probably due to the uneven\ndistribution of lakes along the temperature gradient, with\ngenerally higher temperatures recorded in lakes located on\nthe coastal terrace and lower temperatures recorded in lakes\non the plateau. The influence of temperature is confounded\nby the influence of distance from the west coast and the\nimportance of this in controlling the supply of nutrients and\nions (conductivity) to the lakes. As indicated by a plot of\nthe occurrence of dominant diatom species along the\ntemperature gradient, the diatoms do not show quite as clear\ntransitions as they do with other environmental variables,\nalthough some species appear to be more abundant at\neither end of the temperature gradient (Fig. 4). However,\ntemperature can still be an important driving factor and\ndiatom-temperature transfer functions have previously been\ndeveloped for high latitude locations (e.g. Pienitz et al.\n1995, Wolfe 2003, Gremmen et al. 2007).\nFurther sampling is planned to increase the number of\nsamples in the dataset over a more evenly distributed\naltitudinal gradient to try and improve the performance of the\ndiatom-temperature transfer function. Analyses of microfossil\ninvertebrates are also underway to investigate the potential\nfor developing an invertebrate-temperature transfer function.\nPotential applications of this dataset to climate\nchange studies\nUnderstanding past rates and magnitudes of climate changes\nprovides a fundamental basis for understanding recently\nobserved rates of global warming and assessing the\nimplications of this for the future.\nThe prevailing westerly winds are a dominant feature of\nMacquarie Island climate, and their latitudinal position\nshifts over time (Lamy et al. 2001). Toggweiler et al. (2006)\ndemonstrated that warm climates, like the present, tend to\nhave poleward-shifted westerlies, while cold climates like\nduring the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have\nequatorward-shifted westerlies. Recent observations tend to\nsupport this as recent increases in global temperatures have\ncoincided with poleward shifted westerlies (Shindell &\nSchmidt 2004) and Marshall & Connolly (2006) have\nshown that in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, the\ncurrent rising temperature trend is probably due to increased\nwesterly wind strength, driven by increased greenhouse gas\nconcentrations. Consequently, it is possible that poleward\ndisplacement of the southern westerlies could be involved in\npast periods of higher temperature and precipitation on both\nthe sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctic Peninsula, while\nduring periods where the westerlies move equatorward,\nthese regions can be expected to adopt a more cold, dry\nAntarctic-like climate regime.\nRecent examinations of global ocean temperature changes\nhave shown warming in the upper 1000 m since the 1950s\n(Gillie 2002). Warming in the Southern Ocean has been\nconcentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current\n(ACC) and has caused an average 8% increase in rainfall\nover the Southern Ocean and South Pacific since the late\n1970s (Wong et al. 1999).\nThese changes are likely to occur at greater magnitude on\nlonger glacial-interglacial timescales and involve movement\nof the fronts within the ACC, including the Polar Frontal\nZone (PFZ). Marine core records from the Southern Ocean\nshow that during the LGM the PFZ moved at least as far\nnorth as 528S, accompanied by a northward extension of sea\nice extent and a major reduction in biological production\n(Crosta et al. 1998). As Macquarie Island is located at 548S,\nit is ideally placed to respond to changes in the position of\nthe westerlies, provide information on migration of the PFZ\npoleward and equatorward, and respond to warming of the\nSouthern Ocean. These factors control the climate of\nMacquarie Island by influencing wind, precipitation and\ntemperature regimes, and this study shows that records of\nthese changes are likely to be preserved in lake sediments on\nthe island. The nutrient and conductivity transfer functions\ndeveloped in this study may be applied to sub-fossil diatom\nassemblages in lake sediments on Macquarie Island to\nreconstruct nutrient and conductivity trends. Increased wind\nand rainfall can be expected to result in an increase in\nnutrients (from surface runoff) and conductivity (from sea\nspray) of the lakes (see the close association between\nnutrients, conductivity and turbidity, Figs 2 & 4). These\ntransfer functions can be applied over long time periods (i.e.\nglacial-interglacial timescales) to investigate nutrient and\nconductivity changes as a consequence of poleward and\nequatorward shifts in the westerlies and PFZ. Over shorter\ntime periods, high resolution studies may allow sub-decadal\npatterns in wind and rainfall to be reconstructed. Applying\nquantitative reconstruction techniques to sediments from\nMacquarie Island lakes therefore has the potential to provide\nvaluable insights into long-term ecological change,\ncontributing to understanding changes in the Southern Ocean\nand climate change.\nMACQUARIE ISLAND DIATOMS 47\nPotential applications of this dataset to human\nimpact studies\nWhile Macquarie Island lakes respond to changes in climate,\nthey are also vulnerable to direct human impacts. The greatest\ncurrent threat is the rapidly expanding rabbit population.\nRabbits were introduced in 1878 and with the recent\nremoval of feral cats by 2001, the rabbit population has\nexperienced a rapid increase in numbers. The major impact\nof this has been an increase in grazing pressure and\nburrowing, resulting in large areas of vegetation being\ndestroyed, causing slope instability, erosion and loss of\nhabitat (PWS 2007).\nDiatom-inferred nutrient and conductivity trends will\nenable changes in lake water chemistry to be tracked and\ndiatom analyses will record any changes in biodiversity as\na result of these human impacts. With additional\ngeochemical analyses, it should be possible to track\nchanging feral animal populations. Similar work has been\nundertaken on Signy Island where seal hairs were used to\ntrack an expanding seal population following the decline\nand cessation of the whaling industry (Hodgson &\nJohnston 1997) and on King George Island and Hope Bay\nwhere faecally derived elements have been used to track\nchanges in penguin populations (Zale 1994, Sun et al.\n2000). In the northern high latitudes, changes in nutrient\ninputs to lakes have been used to track the impact of\nchanging seabird populations (Wagner & Melles 2001). A\nsimilar approach could be used to reconstruct past animal\npopulations on Macquarie Island.\nConclusions\nClimate changes, in particular increasing wind, temperature\nand rainfall, and problems associated with feral animals,\nmeans that establishing baseline conditions before human\narrival on Macquarie Island is a critical step in developing\nappropriate management strategies and targets to maintain\nthe island\u2019s conservation and World Heritage status. This\nstudy has demonstrated that diatom-based palaeolimnological\nmethods provide powerful tools to reconstruct past\nenvironments on Macquarie Island. Currently, the\nmanagement and conservation strategies of Macquarie Island\nare focused on the present and future. What palaeolimnology\ncan offer is an accurate reconstruction of past natural\nvariability, a definition of baseline environmental conditions\non the island prior to human contact and provides a way to\ntrack the nature and direction of subsequent environmental\nchange. The success of future management efforts (such as\nthe removal of non native species) can then be judged\nagainst these natural baselines.\nAcknowledgements\nThis studywas funded by anAustralianAntarctic Science grant\n(2663).
