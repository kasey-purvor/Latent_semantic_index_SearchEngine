All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nOn decadal to multidecadal time scales, thermal expansion of sea\nwaters and land ice loss are the main contributors to sea level\nvariations (Bindoff et al., 2007). However, modification of the\nterrestrial water cycle due to climate variability and direct anthropo-\ngenic forcing may also affect sea level (Milly et al., 2010). While in\nrecent years, thermal expansion and land ice melt were the object of\nnumerous investigations (Bindoff et al., 2007; see also Cazenave and\nLlovel, 2010 for a review), the terrestrial water contribution to sea\nlevel has been less studied (Milly et al., 2010). For the past decades,\nvariations in land water storage caused by climate change and\nvariability cannot be directly estimated from observations because\nthese are almost unexistent at global continental scale. However,global hydrological models (or land surface models) developed for\natmospheric and climatic studies can be used for estimating total\nwater storage (Milly et al., 2010). The models compute the mass and\nenergy balance at the Earth surface, as well as water storage change in\nsoil in response to prescribed variations of near-surface atmospheric\ndata (precipitation, temperature, humidity and wind) and radiation.\nUsing atmospheric re-analyses and the Orchidee land surface model\noutputs, Ngo-Duc et al. (2005a) estimated the terrestrial water\nstorage contribution to sea level over 1950\u20132000. They found no\nclimatic long-term trend but large interannual\/decadal fluctuations,\nof several millimetre amplitudes when translated into sea level\nequivalent. A similar result was also found by Milly et al. (2003) using\nthe Land Dynamics model over 1980\u20132000. Direct human interven-\ntion on land water storage and induced sea level changes have been\nestimated in several studies (e.g., Chao, 1995; Sahagian, 2000;\nGornitz, 2001; Chao et al., 2008). The largest contributions come\nfrom groundwater pumping (either for agriculture, industrial and\ndomestic use) and reservoir filling. Surface water depletion has a nonnterannual time scale, Glob. Planet. Change (2010),\n2 W. Llovel et al. \/ Global and Planetary Change xxx (2010) xxx\u2013xxxnegligible contribution. Although detailed information is lacking, and\nestimates vary significantly between authors, ground water depletion\nmay have contributed to past decades sea level rise by 0.55\u20130.64 mm\/\nyr (e.g., Gornitz, 2001). A recent update by Wada et al. (2010)\nsuggests an even larger contribution of groundwater depletion, of 0.8\n\u00b10.1 mm\/yr sea level rise over 1960\u20132000. During the past 50 years,\nseveral tens of thousands of dams have been constructed over world\nrivers, leading to water impoundment into artificial reservoirs, hence\nnegative contribution to sea level. Several attempts have been made\nto estimate the total volume of water stored in artificial reservoirs\nover the past half century (e.g., Chao, 1995; V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 1997;\nSahagian, 2000; Gornitz, 2001). Chao et al. (2008) reconstructed\nwater impoundment history of nearly 30,000 reservoirs constructed\nduring the 20th century and estimated a \u22120.55 mm\/yr contribution\nto sea level due to dams and artificial reservoirs during the past half\ncentury. Hence, for the last few decades, effects on sea level from\ngroundwater depletion and water impoundment behind dams are of\nthe same order of magnitude and opposite sign. However, a slight\npositive residual contribution to sea level, of ~0.25 mm\/yr, may be\nexpected if the groundwater depletion component dominates.\nFor the recent years, terrestrial water storage (TWS) change can\nalso be estimated from observations of the GRACE space gravimetry\nmission. The GRACE mission, launched in 2002, was developed by US\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the\nGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR), to measure spatio-temporal change\nof the Earth gravity field at a monthly interval (Tapley et al., 2004). On\ntime scales ranging from months to decades, these temporal gravity\nvariations mainly result from surface redistribution of water inside\nand among the outer fluid envelopes of the Earth (Wahr et al., 2004).\nThus, on land, GRACE provides measurements of TWS change in river\nbasins. Two recent studies (Ramillien et al., 2008; Llovel et al., 2010a)\nhave estimated the water volume trend in the ~30 largest river\nbasins worldwide using GRACE, and found small net water volume\nchange globally since 2003, with a \u00b10.2 mm\/yr sea level rise\ncontribution.\nIn the present study, we focus on the interannual variability of\nTWS rather than on the trend, and investigate its contribution tomean\nsea level variability. We consider three different periods which each\ndepends on data availability: (1) 2003\u20132009 (GRACE era), (2) 1993\u2013\n2003 and (3) 1955\u20131995. For the GRACE era (period 1), accordingly,\nwe use GRACE data to estimate TWS. For periods 2 and 3, we estimate\nTWS variations from outputs of the ISBA-TRIP (Interactions between\nSoil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere\u2014Total Runoff Integrating Pathways)\nglobal hydrological model (Alkama et al., 2010). For sea level, we used\ntide gauge-based values for period 3 and satellite altimetry for periods\n1 and 2 (see Section 3).\n2. Effect of land water storage change on sea level\nExcluding ice sheets and glaciers, fresh water on land is stored in\nvarious reservoirs: snow pack, rivers, lakes, man-made reservoirs,\nwetlands and inundated areas, root zone (upper few meters of the\nsoil) and aquifers (groundwater reservoirs). Terrestrial waters are\ncontinuously exchanged with atmosphere and oceans through\nvertical and horizontal mass fluxes (precipitation, evaporation,\ntranspiration of the vegetation, surface runoff and underground\nflow). This exchange is an integral part of the global climate system,\nwith important links and feedbacks generated through its influence\non surface energy and moisture fluxes between continental water,\natmosphere and oceans. Thus climate change and variability modify\nTWS. As briefly discussed earlier, human activities also directly affect\nTWS.\nTo estimate the contribution of TWS variations on sea level, we can\nsimply consider the conservation of water mass in the Earth's system\nas in previous studies (e.g., Chen et al., 1998). On time scales of years\nto decades, solid Earth stores can be neglected, so that only changes inPlease cite this article as: Llovel, W., et al., Terrestrial waters and sea lev\ndoi:10.1016\/j.gloplacha.2010.10.008terrestrial reservoirs, ocean and atmosphere can be considered, with\nthe mass conservation as follows:\n\u0394Mcont + \u0394Mocean + \u0394Matm = 0 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u0394M represents changes in water mass for the three reservoirs:\ncontinents, ocean and atmosphere.\nPrevious studies have shown that water vapour change in the\natmosphere cannot be neglected at the annual time scale (Chen et al.,\n1998; Minster et al., 1999). On multidecadal time scale, it is generally\nconsidered that change in atmospheric water storage is negligible\n(Trenberth and Smith, 2005), even if because of global warming, an\nincrease of atmospheric water vapour is expected. However, because\nof the water holding capacity of the atmosphere, even with higher\ntemperature, this contribution is expected to be small as far as sea\nlevel change is concerned. Trenberth and Smith (2005) showed that,\non interannual time scale, water vapour fluctuations are mostly\nassociated with ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) events and lead\nto up to ~0.5\u00d71015 kg variations of themass of the atmosphere.When\ntranslated into sea level equivalent, this corresponds to sea level\nfluctuations at the mm level. This is not negligible considering the\nrange of interannual fluctuations of the global mean sea level during\nENSO events (of about 8 mm; see later). However in the present\nstudy, we choose to ignore the water vapour contribution.\nThus Eq. (1) becomes:\n\u0394Mocean\u2248\u2212\u0394Mcont: \u00f02\u00de\n\u0394Mocean represents the change with time in mass of the ocean due\nto total fresh water input from continents (i.e., land waters plus land\nice melt). It can be further expressed in terms of equivalent sea level\nchange by simply dividing the total continental water volume change\nby the mean surface of the oceans (assumed equal to 360\u00d7106 km2)\nand changing its sign. In the following, we only consider the land\nwater contribution because it is the purpose of the present study\n(keeping in mind that global land ice fluctuations may eventually\nslightly contribute to the sea level interannual signal). The associated\n\u0394Mcont componentmay then be quantified in estimating the change in\nwater storage on land (with \u0394Mcont=\u0394TWS).\nAt a river basin scale, temporal change in water storage TWS is\nrelated to precipitation P, evapotranspiration E and river runoff R\nthrough the water balance equation:\ndTWS=dt \u00bc P\u0002 E\u0002 R \u00f03\u00de\nIf P, E and R, or TWS were known globally, it would be possible to\nuse these hydrological parameters to estimate the effect of land water\nstorage on sea level. GRACE space gravimetry provides direct\nmeasurements of TWS while hydrological models solve Eq. (3) to\nestimate TWS.\n3. Data used in this study\n3.1. Sea level data\nFor periods 1 (2003\u20132009) and 2 (1993\u20132003) GMSL is derived\nfrom satellite altimetry (Topex\/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2). Data\nfrom two different groups are considered (CLS \u2014 Collecte Localisation\nSatellites, update from Ablain et al., 2009 and NASA\/GSFC \u2014 Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Beckley et al., 2010).While altimetry-based GMSL\ntrends agree well whatever the data processing group, slight\ndifferences are noticed on interannual time scale, as we will see later.\nThe altimetry data are corrected for the standard geophysical and\nenvironmental corrections, including instrumental drifts and bias (see\nAblain et al., 2009; Beckley et al., 2010 for details).el variations on interannual time scale, Glob. Planet. Change (2010),\n3W. Llovel et al. \/ Global and Planetary Change xxx (2010) xxx\u2013xxxFor period 3 (1955\u20131995), we considered global mean sea level\n(GMSL) time series computed by Jevrejeva et al. (2006) from tide\ngauge records. These authors used 1023 RLR (Revised Local\nReference) tide gauge records (monthly data) from the Permanent\nService for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (Woodworth and Player, 2003).\nHowever, they excluded data from Japan due to lack of information\nabout vertical land motion during earthquake events, as well as data\nfrom the Baltic Sea because they may not be representative of the\nglobal ocean. This led to a total of about 800 stations usable for the\nglobal mean sea level reconstruction. The maximum number of tide\ngauges in a given year is 585. No inverted barometer correction was\napplied. Tide gauge records were corrected for glacial isostatic\nadjustment (GIA) of the solid Earth (Peltier, 2001). To overcome\ngeographical bias (sampling issue of station locations) a \u201cvirtual\nstation\u201d method has been used. In this method, stations close to each\nother are weighted much less than isolated ones and uncertainties\ndepend on how considered stations are locally representative of the\nestimated sea level. Global mean sea level (GMSL) data and their\nerrors (Jevrejeva et al., 2006) are available from http:\/\/www.psmsl.\norg\/products\/reconstructions\/jevrejevaetal2006.php.\n3.2. Terrestrial water storage\n3.2.1. The ISBA-TRIP global hydrological model\nISBA is a relatively simple land surface model (LSM) that uses the\nforce-restore method to calculate the time variation of the surface\nenergy and water budgets (Noilhan and Planton, 1989) including\nsnow pack evolution based on a simple one-layer scheme (Douville\net al., 1995). The soil hydrology is represented by three layers: a thin\nsurface layer (1 cm) included in the rooting layer and a third layer to\ndistinguish between the rooting depth and the total soil depth (Boone\net al., 1999). An exponential profile of the saturated hydraulic\nconductivity with soil depth is also assumed for the soil column. This\ntype of profile attempts to represent the fact that roots and organic\nmatter favor the development of macropores and enhance water\nmovement near the soil surface, and that soil compaction is an obstacle\nfor vertical water transport in the deep soil (Decharme et al., 2006).\nThe soil water content varieswith surface infiltration, soil evaporation,\nplant transpiration and deep drainage. The infiltration rate is\ncomputed as the difference between the through-fall rate and the\nsurface runoff. The through-fall rate is the sum of rainfall not\nintercepted by the canopy, dripping from the interception reservoir\nand snowmelt from the snow pack. ISBA also uses a comprehensive\nparameterization of sub-grid hydrology to account for the heteroge-\nneity of precipitation, topography and vegetation within each grid cell\n(Decharme and Douville, 2006).\nThe total runoff integrating pathways (TRIP) was developed at\nTokyo University by Oki and Sud (1998). It is a simple river routing\nmodel (RRM) used to convert the daily runoff simulated by ISBA into\nriver discharge on a global river channel network here defined at 1\u00b0 by\n1\u00b0 resolution. The runoff part of the simulated TWS can be validated\nusing direct comparison between simulated and observed discharge.\nTRIP is a simple linear model based on a single prognostic equation for\nthe water mass within each grid cell of the hydrologic network. In\nother words, TRIP only simulates a surface stream reservoir and the\nstream flow velocity is assumed constant and uniform at 0.5 m s\u22121.\nThe outputs of the ISBA-TRIP model cover the period January 1950\nto December 2006, with values given at monthly interval on a 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0\ngrid. They are based on a run in forcedmode. The globalmeteorological\nforcing was provided by the Princeton University (available online at\nhttp:\/\/hydrology.princeton.edu) on a 3-hourly time step and at a 1\u00b0\nresolution (see Alkama et al., 2010 for more details).\n3.2.2. GRACE data\nRawGRACE data are processed by different groups belonging to the\nGRACE project (Center for Space Research \u2014CSR, Jet PropulsionPlease cite this article as: Llovel, W., et al., Terrestrial waters and sea lev\ndoi:10.1016\/j.gloplacha.2010.10.008Laboratory \u2014JPL\u2014 in the USA and Geo-ForschungsZentrum \u2014GFZ\u2014\nin Germany). GRACE data are also processed by other groups (GSFC\/\nNASA in theUSA; GRGS\u2014Groupe de Recherche enG\u00e9od\u00e9sie Spatiale\u2014\nin France and DUT \u2014 Delft University of Technology\u2014 in The\nNetherlands). The GRACE products delivered over land by all groups\nare time series of equivalentwater height, expressed either in terms of\nspherical harmonic expansion or as gridded data. Several GRACE\nproduct releases have been available from the GRACE project, each\ntimewith substantial improvement. Herewe use different GRACE data\nsets: (1) the latest release (RL04) from the TELLUS website (http:\/\/\ngrace.jpl.nasa.gov\/data\/mass\/) for three solutions: the CSR, GFZ and\nJPL solutions (1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 global grids at monthly interval). The RL04\nrelease includes an implementation of the carefully calibrated\ncombination of destripping and smoothing, with a 300 km half-\nwidth Gaussian filter (Chambers, 2006). These GRACE products are\nalso corrected for post-glacial rebound (the solid Earth response to last\ndeglaciation, also sensed by GRACE) using the Paulson et al. (2007)\nmodel (but note that, as we focus here on interannual variability, we\ndo not need to take care of this purely secular effect). These time series\ncover the period from August 2002 through July 2009. We also\nanalysed GRGS solutions (updated from Biancale et al., 2007; data\navailable at http:\/\/bgi.cnes.fr:8110\/geoid-variations\/). Processing of\nthe GRGS GRACE data is described in detail in Bruinsma et al. (2010).\nThe data consist of 10-day 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 gridded solutions expressed in\nequivalent water height (their actual spatial resolution is about\n400 km; Bruinsma et al., 2010). They cover the period from July 2002\nto April 2009.\nAs in Llovel et al. (2010a), we computedwater storage change over\nthe 33 largest world river basins (see Fig. 1 for location). The river\nbasin contours are based on masks of 1\u00b0 resolution from Oki and Sud\n(1998). To estimate the water storage (i.e., water volume) contribu-\ntion of individual river basins at each time step, the spatial average of\nGRACE equivalent water height has been computed over the area\nincluded inside the basin contour, then multiplied by the basin area.\nThis analysis was repeated for each of the three CSR, GFZ and JPL\nGRACE products, from which an average TWS time series was\ndeduced. Similar calculations were performed with the GRGS\nsolutions.\n4. Results\nEach sea level and TWS time series has been detrended and\nthe seasonal cycles (annual plus semi-annual) have been removed\n(12-month and a 6-month period sinusoids have been adjusted to\neach time series and removed). Each residual time series had its mean\nvalue set to zero over the time span of interest. TWS from both GRACE\nand ISBA-TRIP outputs was further expressed in terms of equivalent\nsea level (ESL) as explained in Section 2. In the following, this quantity\nis called TWS-ESL.\n4.1. Period 1 (2003\u20132009)\nFor period 1 (2003\u20132009) GMSL is based on satellite altimetry\ndata (updated from Ablain et al., 2009). For this time span, we have\nremoved steric effects from the GMSL (i.e., the effects of ocean\ntemperature and salinity) before comparing sea level variations with\nGRACE-based TWS-ESL. In effect, sea level variations result from both\nsteric and mass effects. As we focus here on a mass component (the\nland water storage contribution), it is appropriate to remove the\nsteric effects to observed global mean sea level. This is done using\nArgo profiling floats data processed by Guinehut et al. (2009). The\nsteric sea level computation is described in another paper (Llovel\net al., 2010b). Fig. 2 compares interannual variability in GMSL\n(corrected for steric effects) and TWS-ESL from GRACE (sum of the\n33 river basin contributions). The two GRACE time series are shown\n(i.e., the mean CSR\/GFZ\/JPL solution and the GRGS solution). Fig. 2el variations on interannual time scale, Glob. Planet. Change (2010),\nFig. 1.

They also agree well with ISBA-TRIP TWS-ESL over their\noverlapping time span. Interannual fluctuations in GMSL (corrected\nfor steric effects) are positively correlated with TWS-ESL (correlation\ncoefficient of 0.5 and 0.7 with the mean CSR\/GFZ\/JPL and GRGS\nsolutions respectively at the 95% confidence level). We note that the\nagreement between sea level and TWS improves beyond 2004. As\ndiscussed in Llovel et al. (2010b), the poor Argo coverage in 2002\u2013\n2003 underestimates the steric sea level correction. For that reason,\nthe corrected sea level for 2002\u20132003 is shown by a dashed curve.\nHowever, the overall agreement over the 2003\u20132009 time span is\ngood. This result suggests that for the recent years, interannual\nvariability of GMSL is, at least partly, caused by year-to-year\nvariability of land water storage. Fig. 2 is suggestive of nearly annual\nfluctuations. However, as already mentioned, the annual cycle has\nbeen removed. A spectral analysis \u2013not shown\u2013 of the three TWS-ESL\ntime series (i.e., the two GRACE solutions and the ISBA-TRIP outputs,\nwith data at monthly interval) displays peaks in the 14\u201316 month and\n24\u201325 month wavebands. The origin of these signals is unclear and\nneeds further investigation.\nFollowing the conclusions of Ngo-Duc et al. (2005b), we investi-\ngated whether the tropical river basins mostly contribute to the TWS\ninterannual variability. For that purpose, we constructed the GRACE-\nbased TWS time series (data from GRGS only), considering only the\nfollowing basins: Amazon, Orinoco, Niger, Congo, Okavango, Indus,\nGanges and Mekong. The corresponding curve, expressed in water\nvolume is shown in Fig. 3. For comparison the curve for the 33 basins is\nsuperimposed. Fig. 3 clearly shows the dominant contribution of the\ntropical river basins. On Fig. 3 we also show the Amazon contribution.\nInterestingly, the Amazon basin alone is a major contribution to the\ntotal signal. Thuswe conclude that interannual variability in sea level is\nhighly associated with water fluctuations of the Amazon basin.el variations on interannual time scale, Glob. Planet.

Period 2 (1993\u20132003)\nFor this time span (1993\u20132003), we compared TWS-ESL from ISBA-\nTRIPwith the altimetry-based global mean sea level. Here we show two\naltimetry-based GMSL curves (from Ablain et al., 2009\u2014called CLS, and\nfrom Beckley et al., 2010 \u2014called GSFC). A 3-month running mean\nsmoothing was applied to the data. The CLS (Fig. 4a) and GSFC (Fig. 4b)\nsea level curves, superimposed to ISBA-TRIP TWS-ESL, are presented\nseparately for clarity. As for period 1, the two quantities can be directly\ncompared. However, unlike for period 1, we did not correct for steric\neffects here. For the pre-Argo period, steric effects are mostly based on\nXbT temperature data, subjects to significant uncertainties. A recent\nstudy by Lyman et al. (2010) compares different global ocean heat\ncontent curves computed by different teams for the period 1993\u20132008\nand shows large difference in interannual variability, especially for the\npre-Argo years (before 2002), revealing large uncertainties introduced\nby the XbTmeasurements (in particular the XbT depth bias correction).\nAs global heat content and thermal expansion follow similar time\nevolution, we choose to not correct sea level for steric effects, in order\nnot to introduce spurious noise on interannual time scale.\nFig. 4a,b shows significant correlation (~0.5 and ~0.7 with CLS and\nGSFC products respectively at the 95% confidence level) between\naltimetry-based sea level and TWS-ESL (from ISBA-TRIP), especially\nduring the 1997\u20131998 ENSO event, and also between 2002 and 2004\n(another ENSO period). During such events, positive sea level\nanomalies seem to essentially result from land water storage change\n(more specifically, from water deficit on land). The study by Ngo-Duc\net al. (2005b) analysed the cause for a higher\/smaller than normal\nannual cycle in GMSL (based on Topex\/Poseidon altimetry) in 1997\u2013\n1998, during the large 1997\u20131998 ENSO event. Using the Orchidee\nLSM, run in a coupled modewith the Atmospheric General Circulation\nModel of the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, they showed\nthat higher\/smaller annual amplitude in sea level (corrected for\nthermal expansion) in 1997\/1998 could be explained by higher\/\nsmaller TWS-ESL, as a result of particularly dry conditions on land due\nto important precipitation deficit over tropical land (inside the 20\u00b0N\u2013\n20\u00b0S domain) during this ENSO event. Year-to-year fluctuations in\nTWS annual amplitude translate into interannual variability. This is\nexactly what Fig. 4a,b shows during the 1997\u20131998 ENSO. Previous\nresults based on the Orchidee LSM are indeed confirmed when usingPlease cite this article as: Llovel, W., et al., Terrestrial waters and sea lev\ndoi:10.1016\/j.gloplacha.2010.10.008the ISBA-TRIP model. Thus, we can quantitatively explain GMSL\nanomaly in 1997\u20131998 by a net water deficit on land during this ENSO\nevent. The good correspondence seen between GMSL and TWS-ESL\naround 2002\u20132004 (another ENSO period) suggests that the same\nhydrological conditions produce similar effects.\nIn Fig. 4a,b, we note some discrepancy between sea level and\nTWS-ESL in 1995. We cannot exclude a steric origin (as steric effects\nare not corrected for). However, the two sea level curves do not\nperfectly coincide at this epoch, suggesting that some efforts should\nbe made to better estimate interannual variability in global mean sea\nlevel. Besides, these disagreements could be due to some other\nphenomena not considered or modelled in the ISBA-TRIP model.\n4.3. Period 3 (1955\u20131995)\nFig. 5 shows the interannual to decadal variability in sea level\n(based on tide gauge data from Jevrejeva et al., 2006) and TWS-ESL\n(from ISBA-TRIP) between 1955 and 1995. Here the two curves haveel variations on interannual time scale, Glob. Planet. Change (2010),\nFig. 5.

The time series\nare detrended, and the seasonal cycle is removed. The time series are smoothed with an\n11-month window.\nFig. 6. Amplitude spectra of the data shown in Fig. 5 (sea level data: solid curve; TWS-\nESL: dashed curve).\n6 W. Llovel et al. \/ Global and Planetary Change xxx (2010) xxx\u2013xxxbeen normalized (norm defined by the largest singular value of the\ntime series). In effect, as shown in Prandi et al. (2009), coastal mean\nsea level displays higher interannual variability than GMSL based on\nglobal data coverage (e.g. from satellite altimetry). This is a sampling\neffect due to sparse tide gauge records when compared to the \u2018true\u2019\nglobal mean computed with quasi global altimetry data. For\ncomparing with TWS-ESL (which represents a global signal), we\nthus decided to normalize both time series to not artificially enhance\nthe observed coastal sea level variability. As for period 2, steric effects\nhave not been corrected for. An 11-month running mean smoothing\nhas been applied to the data. From Fig. 5, we note that the two curves\nare positively correlated (correlation of ~0.5 at the 95% confidence\nlevel). The fluctuations are suggestive of ENSO (El Nino-Southern\nOscillation)-type variability (as observed in 1997\u20131998 during period\n2). For example, we note positive sea level and TWS-ESL anomalies in\n1982\u20131983 and 1986\u20131987, periods of strong ENSO events. We\nperformed a spectral analysis (based on data at monthly interval) of\nmean sea level and TWS-ESL (note that in this case mean sea level and\nTWS-ESL are not normalized). Amplitude spectra are shown in Fig. 6.\nDominant peaks in sea level and TWS-ESL are seen around 3\u20134 years\n6\u20137 years, as expected for a dominant ENSO forcing. Previous studies\n(e.g., Merrifield et al., 2009; Nerem et al., 2010) have reported high\ncorrelation between detrended global mean sea level (over the\naltimetry period) and ENSO proxies, in particular the Multivariate\nENSO Index \u2014MEI (MEI is computed with the six main observed\nvariables over the tropical Pacific which are sea level pressure, zonal\nand meridional components of the surface wind, sea surface\ntemperature, surface air temperature, and total cloudiness fraction\nof the sky, for more information see Wolter, 1987). Nerem et al.\n(2010) suggest that the observed correlation could result from either\na change in ocean heat content associated with ENSO or a change in\nland\/ocean precipitation patterns during ENSO. Our analysis of TWS\nsuggests that it is rather the second process that leads to the observed\ncorrelation, more specifically the change in land water storage during\nENSO events.5. Discussion\nThe results presented earlier for three different time frames\n(2003\u20132009, 1993\u20132003 and 1955\u20131995) reveal the importantPlease cite this article as: Llovel, W., et al., Terrestrial waters and sea lev\ndoi:10.1016\/j.gloplacha.2010.10.008contribution of global terrestrial water storage variations to the\ninterannual variability of the global mean sea level. For periods 2\n(1993\u20132003) and 3 (1955\u20131995) the results are based on the ISBA-\nTRIP model. Furthermore, for period 1 (2003\u20132009) we used GRACE\nspace gravimetry data. This study reports a dominant ENSO signature\nin interannual GMSL and TWS fluctuations. Quantitative comparison\nwith global terrestrial water storage variations shows that the process\ninvolved is water exchange between land river basins and oceans,\nwith drier than normal land during ENSO events. As suggested by\nNgo-Duc et al. (2005b), tropical basins are probably the regions\nmostly involved in this exchange. The Amazon basin in particular\nshows a dominant contribution (at least for period 1) in the exchange\nof water between land and oceans on interannual time scale. This\nstudy points towards a significant influence of the terrestrial water\ncycle on sea level. It provides an explanation of processes involved in\nthe correlation reported by Nerem et al. (2010) between GMSL and\nENSO proxies. It also provides a quantitative explanation of the origin\nof the interannual variability in sea level. This interannual variability\nin sea level has been noticed in many previous studies, but so far had\nremained unexplained. Besides, another potential contribution\nremains to be investigated: the atmospheric water vapour reservoir.\nVariability of water vapour may eventually explain part of the\ndifference between global mean sea level and land water storage at\ninterannual time scale.\nAcknowledgements\nW.
