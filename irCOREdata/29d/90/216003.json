This paper views these benefits through the lens of gift exchange and \ndiscusses the creation of exchange relationships between the employer and employee and between the \nvolunteer organization and employee. Hypotheses derived from the perspective of the employee are tested \nwith a nationally representative sample of volunteers (n = 3,658). Findings suggest ESV benefits are \npositively related to hours volunteered by the employee. Volunteer hours predict employee perceptions of \nskill acquisition. Perceptions of skill acquisition are positively related to perceptions of job success and \nemployer recognition. We discuss implications for business, employees, and volunteer organizations with \nan emphasis on human resources management policy and practice.  \nGift Exchange and ESV      2 \nIntroduction \nIn an April 2006 communication to Home Depot\u2019s employees, Bob Nardelli, former Chairman, \nPresident and CEO, showcased the efforts of the corporate volunteer program, Team Depot (Nardelli, \n2006). Nardelli discussed Team Depot\u2019s Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina and \ndescribed how such projects have not only benefited ravaged communities but have also developed new \nskills for employees and built relationships within the company and community. The Home Depot \nvolunteer program facilitates employees volunteering their time as well as provides equipment, supplies \nand financing for volunteer projects. To ensure it meets its mission to \u201cimprove everything [they] touch,\u201d \nHome Depot budgeted $15 million (not including salaries) in 2005 for volunteer activities and had a \ndedicated staff person at each site\/store to arrange community outreach, thereby facilitating 2 million \nemployee volunteer hours (Points of Light Foundation, 2005). \nHome Depot is just one example of employers supporting their employees\u2019 volunteer activities by \nproviding employer-supported volunteering (ESV) benefits. In a 2006 benefits survey conducted by the \nSociety for Human Resource Management, 20 percent of 368 human resources practitioners reported their \nemployer provides paid time off to volunteer (Gurchiek, 2007). In the 2007 Deloitte Volunteer IMPACT \nSurvey of 1,000 Gen Y individuals (ages 18-26), approximately 67 percent of participants indicated that \nan employer providing volunteer opportunities is a factor in selecting employers for whom to work; 39 \npercent replied that their current employer offers ESV benefits; and 28 percent reported that their current \nemployer uses volunteer programs for employee skill and professional development (Gurchiek, 2007). \nAccording to Hewitt Associates, the number of firms offering ESV benefits grows 25% annually (Koss-\nFeder, 2000). Thus, the practice of ESV programs is of importance for both HR practitioners and \norganizational members.  \nThis phenomenon is also global. In 2000, Business in the Community, a UK non-profit whose \n700 members are all international employers, reported that 89% of its members have an ESV policy and \n53% of its members provide time off (Volunteering England, 2005a). The 2000 National Survey of \nGiving, Volunteering and Participation (NSGVP), used in the current work, reported that the most \nGift Exchange and ESV      3 \ncommon ESV benefits provided by Canadian employers are the approval to take time off (28%), to \nchange work hours (28%), and to use equipment or facilities (26%). Employers in countries such as \nBrazil, India, Lebanon, and Russia have also implemented ESV benefits (Volunteering England, 2005c). \nDespite the increasing frequency of ESV benefits, management research is only beginning to \nexplore the theoretical, empirical, and practical issues regarding ESV benefits (Benjamin, 2001; \nTschirhart, 2005). Benjamin (2001) asserts that existing work has been based on how employers \nimplement ESV programs, and has not focused \u201con analyses of either data or theoretical questions\u201d (p. \n17). Tschirhart (2005) echoes these sentiments stating \u201cemployee volunteering is a research area \ndesperately in need of theory . . . a deeper, more theoretical understanding of employee volunteering can \nhelp guide policies and practices\u201d (p. 25). In a recent review of ESV programs, Cihlar (2004) summarizes \nthe state of the literature as one in which there are few rigorous studies and most information is based on \nanecdotal evidence \u2013 an idea suggested by others as well (Graff, 2004; Tuffrey, 2003). \nMuch of the volunteer literature investigates the dyadic relationship between the individual and \nthe volunteer organization and focuses on factors that predict a person volunteering (Clary, Snyder, \nRidge, Copeland, Stukas, Haugen, & Miene, 1998; Wilson, 2000); the employing organization is not \nconsidered. Conversely, corporate social performance research has focused on the employer and on how \nemployers benefit (Burlingame & Young, 1996; Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Turban & Greening, 1997; \nWalsh, Weber, & Margolis, 2003); however, there is little emphasis on theoretical grounding and rigorous \nempirical tests concerning the relationships and benefits to other audiences (e.g., employees, community \nwelfare, societal institutions, the public good; Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Tschirhart & St. Clair, 2005; \nWalsh, Weber, & Margolis, 2003). Knowledge about ESV benefits may enable organizations to make \ninformed decisions that \u201cavoid counterproductive investments in ineffective fads and fashions, \nsimultaneously becoming more productive and humane\u201d (Rynes & Shapiro, 2005, p. 925). Indeed, \n\u201crigorous scholarship is needed to enhance the growing, but currently, largely atheoretical literature on \nemployee volunteering\u201d (Tschirhart, 2005, p. 26). The current work begins to address this need.  \nGift Exchange and ESV      4 \nIn this paper, we apply gift exchange theory (rooted within social exchange theory) to investigate \nthe exchange relationship between the employer and employee that is established when the employer \noffers ESV benefits to employees, as well as the exchange relationship between the volunteer \norganization and the employee that is created and promoted by the utilization of ESV benefits. To \nillustrate these exchanges, we examine the employees\u2019 reports of their employing organization\u2019s \nprovision of ESV benefits to the employee, the employee\u2019s provision of hours to the volunteer \norganization, and the beneficial outcomes that accrue to the employee and, ultimately, the employing \norganization in the form of general human capital acquisitions and workplace socioeconomic achievement \nperceptions. Our empirical study uses a national, cross-sectional representative sample of \nemployee\/volunteer reports of ESV benefits, volunteer hours, human capital acquisition, volunteer \nrecognition, and job success outcomes. \n The contribution of this work should be evaluated in the context of the scarcity of empirical work \non this issue. Because ESV research is new and emerging, the use of large scale, cross-sectional, single-\ninformant data are appropriate. As suggested by Spector (1994), \u201ccross-sectional questionnaires can \nprovide a . . . first step in studying phenomena of interest. In many areas . . . this first step has been taken \nand it is time to move on\u201d (p. 390). We believe that this first step has not been previously taken in ESV \nresearch; thus, cross-sectional, self-report data are acceptable in this nascent research stage. We discuss \nour procedural and statistical remedies for common method bias and the implications for this research \nlater in this paper. \nESV Programs  \nESV programs, defined as \u201cthe formal and informal policies and practices that employers use to \nencourage and help employees volunteer in community service activities\u201d (Tschirhart, 2005, p. 14), come \nin a variety of forms and encompass many activities. Common activities include encouraging and \nenabling employees to volunteer by implementing benefits such as flextime, time off, reimbursements, \nmonetary gifts, donations, use of facilities, corporate transportation, and other tangible goods. \nPartnerships between employers and the volunteer organizations can be prearranged, formal agreements \nGift Exchange and ESV      5 \nor can be more flexible, informal types of relationships. Price (2002) used an example from the United \nWay to illustrate how some companies create formal partnerships with organizations. The employer \n\u201clends\u201d its top management to the United Way to fulfill leadership positions; the employer pays the \nexecutives\u2019 salaries while the executives are on temporary leave (Price, 2002). Many employers use \nexternal brokers or an internal staff person whose job is to develop relationships with specific volunteer \norganizations and jointly create volunteer programs that best align with the employer\u2019s mission \n(Volunteering England, 2005b). These formalized relationships illustrate what Meijs and Voort (2004) \nwould classify as employer initiated. Relationships can form in two ways: transactional (i.e., \norganizations create formal arrangements that are for their self-interest) and integrative (i.e., strategic \nrelationships facilitate working together to create value for all involved; Austin, 2000; Voort & Meijs, \n2004). \nIn other cases, the partnership is simply a more informal \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the employer has \nwith the employees and the community. An employer provides benefits that enable employees to make \ntheir volunteer decisions autonomously. These more flexible relationships typically do not necessitate \nformal communication, and there is no major commitment to just one volunteer organization. For \nexample, American Express allows employees to take a fully paid 6-month sabbatical to work for a \ncommunity non-profit if the employee has been involved with the volunteer organization for at least ten \nyears (Koss-Feder, 2000). Regardless of an ESV program\u2019s structure, one might posit that the employer, \nemployee, and volunteer organization benefit from the exchange as described below. \nApplying Gift Exchange to ESV Relationships \n Within the social sciences, social and economic exchange theories have often been used to \nexplain reciprocal relationships between individuals (e.g., Andersson & Pearson, 1999; Schieffelin, \n1980), between the organization and individual (e.g., Fuller & Hester, 2001; Eisenberger, Fasolo, & \nDavis-LaMastro, 1990), and between organizations or nations (e.g., Dillon, 1968). Economic exchange is \nfocused on transactional utility maximizing agreements regarding the exchange of valuable resources \n(goods, services, money) in fairly straightforward transactions (e.g., exchange money for a pair of shoes; \nGift Exchange and ESV      6 \nexchange hours worked for an hourly wage). Blau (1964) introduced social exchange to explain the socio-\nemotional reciprocal relationships between parties that go beyond economic exchange and are utilized to \nbuild and foster continued strong relationships. Within the management literature, it is often used to \nexplain relationships between individuals and organizations. Gift exchange is a derivation of social \nexchange. As Balkin and Richeb\u00e9 (2007) asserted in their paper proposing training investments as gift \nexchange, gift exchange is a \u201cspecial type\u201d of social exchange that is \u201cgoverned by a set of rules that \napply to how to exchange the gifts\u201d (p. 55).  \n In gift exchange theory, a gift is characterized as an intangible and\/or tangible \u201cgood or service \n(including the giver\u2019s time, activities, and ideas) voluntarily provided to another person or group\u201d while \nexchange involves \u201cgiving something in return for something received previously or simultaneously, or in \nanticipation of future returns\u201d (Belk & Coon, 1993, p. 394). Gift-giving can elicit a simple \u201cHere, this is \nfor you,\u201d and \u201cThanks\u201d or is composed of more complex components such as \u201cselection of certain times, \nplaces, and assemblages of people\u201d (Belk & Coon, 1993, p. 394) which are activities common to \nvolunteer interactions and programs (Wilson, 2000). Gifts also convey \u201cimportant symbolic messages;\u201d in \nessence, the gift is the \u201cmessage and channel for delivering the message to the recipient\u201d (Belk, 1979, p. \n95-96). For example, by providing ESV benefits employers communicate that it is a giving organization \nand cares about its employees and the community.  \nAs in the broader social exchange framework, gift-giving can allow for integration, fostering \nindividuals and\/or organizations to collectively work together and create and maintain close social ties \nthat ultimately lead to ongoing transactions (Sherry, 1983). As Sherry (1983) posited, \u201cattached strings \nare a connotative aspect of the gift;\u201d thus, \u201csocial bonds [are] forged and reciprocation encouraged\u201d (p. \n158). Gift exchanges between the parties occur and are sustained because each party values each other\u2019s \ngift and the bond created, and as one party supplies its gift to the other, the other feels a duty to \nreciprocate though not necessarily in an equivalent form (Blau, 1964; Gouldner, 1960). Duty or obligation \nis at the core of all formal and informal gift exchange relationships (Belk & Coon, 1993; Mauss, 1990). \nAs long as exchanges maintain equilibrium, parties involved perceive balanced relationships (Balkin & \nGift Exchange and ESV      7 \nRicheb\u00e9, 2007). The objective of gift exchange is to maintain successful and sustainable relationships; \nthus, as long as the gifts exchanged are valued and respected by the respective party, the relationships \ncontinue, and parties are not attentive to gifts being equitable in value (Blau, 1964; Mauss, 1990).  \n The nature of gift-giving and the tenets that guide gift exchange behavior have been examined by \nsociological and anthropological studies (e.g., Blau, 1964; Bourdieu, 1980; Cheal, 1988; Firth, 1972; \nGouldner, 1960; Leach & Leach, 1983; Mauss, 1990; Testart, 2001). Balkin and Richeb\u00e9 (2007) outlined \ntheir understanding of these rules of gift exchange. First, parties must understand the feelings and desires \nof the recipient and what the recipient really needs. In the case of ESV programs, in explaining the \nexchange between employers and employees, employers need skilled employees, and volunteer \nexperiences provide skills; however, employees need support in the form of time and resources to \nparticipate in volunteer activities. In the exchange between volunteer organizations and employees, \nvolunteer organizations need people to volunteer hours, yet employees need, for example, exposure to \nskill development through their volunteer experiences.  \nSecond, parties should demonstrate their appreciation when gifts are offered. In the exchange \nbetween employers and employees, employees should demonstrate their appreciation for ESV benefits by \nacquiring skills and utilizing them for the good of the employer, and employers should show appreciation \nto their employees by recognizing such skills. Volunteer organizations convey their appreciation to the \nemployees\u2019 hours volunteered and, ultimately, the employers\u2019 generosities of ESV gifts by providing \nvolunteer activities that develop human capital. \nThird, explicit contracts cannot exist between parties where the giver can place penalties upon the \nrecipient if the recipient does not offer a specified gift in return at a designated time and\/or value. Given \nthe very nature of the volunteer experience, parties involved in the exchanges are voluntarily gifting \nwhich is inherently not dictated by contract; thus, penalties are not enforced. An employer\u2019s ESV gifts \ntypically have few stipulations; the benefits exist to support the needs of the employee and community. \nTherefore, the anticipated gifts received in return should have no timestamp or contractual strings \nattached. Further, the parties are not necessarily cognizant of the gifts\u2019 monetary values and would not \nGift Exchange and ESV      8 \ncommunicate \u201cthe gift exchange balance sheet\u201d (Balkin & Richeb\u00e9, 2007, p.58). In these situations, the \ngifts exchanged are not appraised monetarily; they are appraised for their social value and mutual concern \nbetween parties. When the employee takes advantage of the ESV benefits, the \u201cemployer supports an \nemployee\u2019s request . . . and gives the employee some flexibility in making up the lost work productivity\u201d \ngiven the hours volunteered (Balkin & Richeb\u00e9, 2007, p. 57). The employee recognizes his\/her \nemployer\u2019s support, and the employee gives back by supporting the employer in achieving its missions or \nobjectives that are important to the employer (Balkin & Richeb\u00e9, 2007) \u2013 such as utilizing human capital \ngained that may improve performance on the job. \nFinally, though gift exchange is dynamic in order to sustain gift-giving relationships, delays in \nexchange of gifts are expected. Reciprocation of a gift too quickly may communicate that the receiver has \nnot thought clearly of what the giver truly needs and values or that the recipient is merely trying to pay off \na debt instead of trying to maintain a social and personal relationship (Balkin & Richeb\u00e9, 2007). In the \ncase of ESVs, the exchange of ESV benefits for skill utilization on the job or the exchange of volunteer \nhours for new skill acquisitions from volunteering is not immediate and plays out over time. Skill \ndevelopment takes time to accumulate from volunteer hours, as does the application of skills to the job \nand employer recognition from skill development and utilization. These rules that guide gift exchange \nresurface in our hypotheses development below.  \nUnderstanding Employee Perceptions of the Gift Exchange Relationships \nIn the existing volunteering literature, anecdotal research suggests myriad benefits from \nvolunteering relationships for those engaged in our proposed gift exchange relationships (Bussell & \nForbes, 2002; Graff, 2004; Tuffrey, 2003). For example, if an employee utilizes the employer\u2019s ESV \nbenefits, he\/she may gain social capital, in addition to human capital, that may provide networks which \nmay be a source for an employer of future hires, new business partners\/ventures, new suppliers, and\/or \nnew customers. Further, goodwill and increased consumer loyalty may be fostered by the community \nperceiving the employer positively for allowing its employees to volunteer and the subsequent volunteer \nactivities achieved. At the same time, employee morale may be increased by engaging in volunteer \nGift Exchange and ESV      9 \nactivities. Volunteer organizations benefit not only from the increased hours volunteered, but also because \nthey do not have to invest in selection mechanisms for qualified volunteers: employees utilizing ESV \nbenefits have already gone through a selection process when hired by the employer. Additionally, the \nvolunteer organizations may retain manpower or a steady supply of volunteers given the sustainability of \ngift exchange relationships. Understandably, not all volunteer activity leads to improved performance and \nbettered outcomes. Hence, we note that negative interaction ultimately violates trust, undermines duty and \nobligation, and does not abide by the gift exchange rules outlined above, thus ending continued gift \nexchanges (Blau, 1964; Cheal, 1988; Mauss, 1990).  \n We recognize that many gifts have potential to be exchanged in the volunteering relationships \nthat are facilitated by ESV benefits. However, following Balkin and Richeb\u00e9\u2019s (2007) assertions about \nemployer investments in a gift exchange framework and given the limits of our data, our hypotheses \ndevelopment focuses solely on employee perceptions of ESV benefit receipt, hours volunteered, human \ncapital acquisition, and workplace socioeconomic achievement. Abiding by Sutton and Staw\u2019s (1995) \nsuggestion regarding theoretical developments in new and emerging research areas, we are able to \nillustrate the existence of these gift exchange relationships between the employer and the employee and \nbetween the employee and the volunteer organization by utilizing these variables.  \nESV benefits and volunteer hours. In the literature on volunteering, many individual motivations \nhave been ascribed including the following: individual intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Clary et al., \n1998; Omoto & Snyder, 1995; Peloza & Hassay, 2006; Peterson, 2004); non-profit organizational support \n(Farmer & Fedor, 1999); cultural and social capital such as religion and informal social support (Wilson \n& Musick, 1997a); work and family influences (Freeman, 1997; Gomez & Gunderson, 2003); and human \ncapital influences such as education levels and income levels (Vaillancourt, 1994).  \nIn addition to the role of myriad individual motivations to volunteer, an employer\u2019s provision of \nESV benefits is likely to increase volunteering. ESV benefits provide an employee access to more time, \ndecreased cost, and options to assuage workplace constraints, thereby making it more likely for an \nemployee to provide a volunteer organization with more hours of volunteer work. Without ESV benefits, \nGift Exchange and ESV      10 \nemployees may be less inclined to volunteer especially given today\u2019s work-life conflicts (Volunteer \nCanada, 2001). Price (2002) suggested that employees find it easier to volunteer when the employer \nassists with volunteering and\/or handles the communication and logistics. Further, Peterson (2004) \ndetermined that employer recruitment strategies influence participation in corporate sponsored volunteer \nactivities. ESV provisions may also suggest normative information encouraging involvement in \nvolunteering. Overall, an employer sponsoring ESV benefits not only signals to employees that they are \nvalued but also that their volunteering is valued. ESV benefits provide assistance to overcome existing \nobstacles to participation in volunteer activities thereby increasing the likelihood and amount of \nvolunteering.  \nHypothesis 1. Employer-Supported Volunteering (ESV) benefits are positively related to \nemployees\u2019 hours of volunteering. \nVolunteer hours and skill acquisition. Although employer volunteer programs are generally \nbelieved to provide skill acquisition opportunities for employees (Points of Light Foundation & Center \nfor Corporate Citizenship, 2005), there is not extensive work testing explicitly this linkage. Some have \nlooked at this relationship, but findings have either been qualitative, descriptive, or anecdotal (Geroy, \nWright, & Jacoby, 2000; Graff, 2004; Hall, McKeown, & Roberts, 2001; Pancer, Baetz, & Rog, 2002). \nFor example, while participating in volunteer activities, volunteers reinforce their existing skills but also \nmay acquire new ones such as communication and interpersonal skills through interacting with other \nvolunteers, the community, and the volunteer organization staff. Volunteer organizations may train \nvolunteers to perform certain tasks; examples are fundraising, technical, managerial, and organizational \nskills. Further, a new appreciation and understanding of community and social issues, arising through \ninvolvement, may enable the volunteer to better understand his\/her employer\u2019s customer base.  \nDay and Devlin\u2019s (1998) study represents one exception to the absence of empirical work on \nemployers and volunteering. Day and Devlin proposed and tested the idea that wage premiums are \nawarded to volunteers; employers are willing to pay more to volunteers because volunteering may signal \nunobservable characteristics of their employees and\/or because skills acquired through volunteering are \nGift Exchange and ESV      11 \nvaluable to the employer. Results suggest a wage premium for volunteers. However, given data \nlimitations, they were unable to make any inferences regarding the reasons for these wage premiums, and, \nthus, questions about why an employer would provide ESV benefits and whether skills actually accrue to \nvolunteers remain. The current study investigates these issues theoretically and empirically by positing \nand testing the notion that skills accrue to volunteers that are valuable to and rewarded by the employer.  \nThe rationale for the linkage between volunteer hours and skill acquisition is straightforward: as \nemployees increase their volunteer hours, the employee spends more hours interacting with the volunteer \norganization. As a result, the volunteer organization in exchange for hours volunteered may assign the \nemployee more tasks to complete, more complex assignments, or larger scope projects that facilitate \ngreater opportunities for skill acquisition.  \nHypothesis 2. Employees\u2019 hours of volunteering are positively related to skills acquired \nfrom volunteering. \n Skill acquisition and socioeconomic achievement. Wilson (2000) emphasized that knowledge \nacquisition from volunteering can be a conduit to one\u2019s workplace socioeconomic achievement that later \nmay result in an individual\u2019s more positive reputation on the job, aid one in finding future work, or \nenhancement of \u201cthe quality of [the current] job\u201d (p. 232). As a result of skill acquisition, it is likely that \nthe employee will feel more equipped and capable on the job, and, thus, he\/she will perceive \nhimself\/herself as being more successful on the job. An employee\u2019s perception of his\/her success is \ninfluential in one\u2019s decision to continue the gift exchange cycle and volunteer activities.  \n In their study of predictors of job success, Wayne, Liden, Kraimer, and Graf (1999) determined \nthat skill acquisition is significantly related to career satisfaction. According to the authors, training \ncontributes to employee intrinsic career success. In their meta-analysis, Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman \n(2005) determined significant corrected correlations between organizational sponsored training and skill \ndevelopment opportunities and three measures of success on the job (i.e., salary, promotion, and \nsatisfaction). Similar to these studies, we hypothesize that human capital acquisition is a predictor of the \nemployee\u2019s job success perceptions. \nGift Exchange and ESV      12 \nHypothesis 3a. Skills acquired from volunteering are positively related to an employee\u2019s \njob success perceptions. \n Further, Akerlof (1982) suggests the likelihood of being rewarded or recognized on the job is \npartially a function of skill acquisition and successful application of those skills to the job; he considered \nthis a gift exchange between employer and employee. The same is likely to be true in the context of skills \nacquired via volunteer activities. Given that the employer understands the value of skill acquisition from \nvolunteering and application of those skills to the job, the employer is likely to acknowledge or recognize \nemployee skills gained from volunteering. Thus, employer recognition plays a role in sustaining the gift \nexchange relationships.  \nHypothesis 3b. Skills acquired from volunteering are positively related to the employers\u2019 \nrecognition of employees for volunteering.  \nAdditionally, the absence of recognition may play a role in failure to sustain the gift exchange \nrelationship. Previous literature has determined that individuals will continue to volunteer if they perceive \nthat their work is appreciated and are somehow rewarded (Farmer & Fedor, 1999; Field & Johnson, 1993; \nGora & Nemerowicz, 1985). Field and Johnson (1993) suggested that individuals are likely to discontinue \nservice to the volunteer organization if they are not receiving adequate rewards. Farmer and Fedor (1999) \ndetermined that a volunteer organization receives greater participation and longer service duration from \nits volunteers, as long as the volunteer perceives the volunteer organization as appreciating and valuing \nhis\/her service. Similarly, a lack of recognition from an employer for the volunteer hours and \ncorresponding skill development may result in lower rates of participation in volunteering. These findings \nare consistent with the reciprocity expectations evoked in gift exchange theory. Overall, given both that \nrecognition is a function of skill acquisition (Akerlof, 1982) and that the absence of recognition may \nreduce volunteering and skill acquisition, it is likely that skill acquisition is rewarded with recognition by \nthe employer.  \nGift Exchange and ESV      13 \nMethod \nData and Sample \nThe data are from the 2000 National Survey of Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (NSGVP). \nThe 2000 NSGVP is one of the most extensive assessments measuring giving, volunteering, and \nparticipating behaviors ever completed. Statistics Canada administered the 2000 NSGVP to five of the six \nrotation groups of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) during October through December 2000 (Statistics \nCanada, 2001). Of the 40,236 households who responded to the LFS, 28,173 NSGVP interviews were \ncompleted (70% response). Of the NSGVP respondents, 13,449 non-volunteers were screened out after \nbeing identified as non-volunteers, yielding a removal of 65% of non-volunteer respondents. The \nremaining NSGVP sample contains a nationally representative sample of 14,724 Canadians, ages 15-69, \nfrom all ten provinces. Due to our focus on the gift exchanges among the constituents (i.e., employers, \nemployees, and volunteer organization), we narrowed the initial NSGVP sample down to those that are \nemployees (and not self-employed or unemployed) and are volunteers. This reduced the sample to a total \nof 4,275 individuals (29%). \nBased on the sample of 4,275 individuals, we imposed two additional selection rules to the final \nsample. First, we decided to drop individuals (n = 429) that were required to volunteer by their employers \nor by the government. Several have questioned if mandated volunteering can be legitimately considered \nvolunteering (Meijs & Voort, 2004). Second, careful examination on the variables of interest suggested \noutliers associated with the number of volunteering hours. Thus, we decided to drop 37 individuals who \nwere located at the upper 1 percent of the sample in volunteering hours (discussed below). Therefore, the \nfinal sample was a total of 3,809 individuals. Due to missing values, the analysis is based on a final \nsample of 3,658 individuals.  \nMeasures \nAs recognized by the Podsakoff, Shen, and Podsakoff (2006) critique of measurement models \nwithin the literature, many measures are often inaccurately treated as reflective constructs when they are \nin fact formative measures. Unlike reflective measures in which items are assumed to be a manifestation \nGift Exchange and ESV      14 \nof an underlying construct, formative measures are composed of items presumed to be determinants of an \nemergent construct that define the construct rather than reflect it. Evaluating formative measures as \nreflective can influence one to incorrectly interpret a construct\u2019s effect on another (Jarvis, MacKenzie, & \nPodsakoff, 2003). Within the current study, ESV benefits, volunteer hours, and skill acquisition variables \nare considered formative measures.  \nPodsakoff et al. (2006) provide four criteria to consider when determining the nature of a \nmeasure: direction of causality, interchangeability, covariance, and similarity of the nomological network. \nFor illustrative purposes, we discuss these criteria as they relate to the ESV measures. First, the direction \nor causality for formative constructs suggests that formative constructs are conceptualized as being \ndetermined by their measures. We believe that each ESV construct is determined by the benefit items \nprovided (i.e., time off and flextime items determine time oriented ESV benefits); ESV items are not \nreflective of a larger ESV benefit latent construct. Second, items for formative constructs are not expected \nto be interchangeable, and we would argue that our ESV items are not interchangeable. For example, an \nitem on use of facilities is not interchangeable with an item on donations. Third, items for formative \nconstructs need not covary at a high level with one another; they may be positively, negatively, or \nunrelated to one another. One could argue that ESV benefit items may operate such that they substitute \nfor one another; presence of one does not mean that other benefit items are offered. Empirically, our ESV \nitems are positively correlated, but not highly correlated with one another. Fourth, the nomological \nnetwork for the antecedents and outcomes of the items need not be similar for formative measures. We \nsuggest that the antecedents and outcomes of different ESV items may indeed be different. Given this \nillustration and that volunteer hours and skill acquisition variables also meet the criteria above, the \nvariables discussed qualify as formative measures. \n Employer-supported volunteer (ESV) benefits: Time oriented & financial\/logistic oriented. Eight \nitems were asked about ESV benefits and are grouped into two categories as presented below along with \nthe number of participants endorsing the item. Time oriented ESV benefits were measured by summing \ntwo dichotomous items (1 for \u201cYes\u201d and 0 for \u201cNo\u201d) asking if in the past 12 months the employer offered \nGift Exchange and ESV      15 \nthe following: (1) approval to take time off or the opportunity to spend some time doing volunteer work \nwhile on the job (n=1042), and (2) approval to change work hours to spend time volunteering (n=1019). \nThe financial\/logistic oriented ESV benefits were measured by summing six items (1 for \u201cYes\u201d and 0 for \n\u201cNo\u201d) asking \u201cIn the past 12 months, did you get any of the following types of support from your \nemployer to help with your volunteer activities?\u201d The items included: (1) approval for use of facilities or \nequipment for your volunteer activities (n=967); (2) employer\u2019s donation of prizes, gift certificates, food, \netc. (n=91); (3) employer\u2019s donation of t-shirts, company goods, etc. (n=30); (4) employer\u2019s financial \ndonation to the organization (n=78); (5) employer\u2019s providing transportation (n=13); and (6) employer\u2019s \nsponsoring of an event, paid entry fee, membership fee, etc. (n=73). Given these are formative items, we \nsummed the indicators as this is one appropriate method to determine a formative construct\u2019s estimate \n(Nachum, 2003). The time oriented ESV benefit\u2019s mean was 0.55 and ranged from 0 to 2, while the \nfinancial\/logistic oriented ESV benefit\u2019s mean was 0.36 and ranged from 0 to 6. \nVolunteer hours. Prior to reporting hours volunteered, participants indicated the unpaid voluntary \nactivities or services they were involved in within the past year for a group or organization. These items \naided participants to clearly understand the comprehensive meaning of volunteering and what it includes. \nExamples are as follows: \u201cIn the past 12 months, as an unpaid volunteer for an organization, did you do \nany canvassing, campaigning, or fundraising; did you serve as an unpaid member of a board or \ncommittee; did you teach or coach for an organization; did you collect, serve, or deliver food or other \ngoods; did you help to maintain, repair or build facilities?\u201d  \nFollowing items about activities, participants reported the hours volunteered for twelve volunteer \norganization types during the previous 12 months (e.g., culture and recreation, education and research, \nreligion, business\/professional associations, and health). An additional item asked the individual to \nidentify remaining hours volunteered for volunteer organizations not specified. The volunteer hours \nGift Exchange and ESV      16 \nvariable was derived by aggregating participants\u2019 reports of hours. After removing 37 individuals with \nexcessive volunteer hours, the aggregated hours mean was 125.15 and ranged from 1 hour to 1248 hours.\n1\n  \nSkills acquired from volunteering. Skill acquisition from volunteering was measured by summing \nresponses to seven dichotomous (1 for \u201cYes\u201d and 0 for \u201cNo\u201d) questions asking \u201cHave your volunteer \nactivities provided you with: (1) fundraising skills (n=1706); (2) technical\/office skills (n=1158); (3) \norganizational\/managerial skills (n=2159); (4) increased knowledge, for example, about health, women\u2019s \nissues, political issues, etc. (n=2316); (5) communication skills (n=2465); (6) interpersonal skills \n(n=2886); and (7) some other skills (n=3)?\u201d The skills acquired mean was 3.47 and ranged form 0 to 7.  \nEmployer\u2019s recognition. The recognition variable was measured by an item asking \u201cDid your \nemployer give you recognition or a letter of thanks for your volunteer activities?\u201d within the last year. We \ncoded \u201cYes\u201d as 1 and \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d, \u201cNot Stated,\u201d or \u201cRefused to Respond\u201d as 0. \nJob success perception. The job success perception variable was measured by an item asking \u201cDo \nyou think your volunteer activities have helped your chances of success in your paid job [in the past 12 \nmonths]?\u201d We coded \u201cYes\u201d as 1 and \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d, \u201cNot Stated,\u201d or \u201cRefused to Respond\u201d as 0. \n Control variables. A rich set of control variables has been identified in the literature as key \nfactors affecting an individual\u2019s volunteer behavior (for a comprehensive review, see Knoke & Wright-\nIsak, 1982; Wilson, 2000; Wilson & Musick, 1997a). These comprehensive controls allow for more \nprecise, less biased estimates that strengthen analyses.  \n Background variables: Wilson (2000) reported that aging may have a negative effect on one\u2019s \ndecision to volunteer. In some societies gender may not have an effect; however, women in North \n                                                 \n1\n An unreasonable number of volunteer hours were reported by some of the participants. Unfortunately, \nthere is no well accepted recommendation to deal with this kind of measurement error, which demands a \njudgment call. We decided to drop observations in the 1 percent of the upper tail of the volunteer hour \ndistribution. A total of 37 individuals were dropped: their average number of volunteer hours was 1829 \nhours (equivalent to 229 eight hour days) and ranged from 1260 hours to 4800 hours. Although dropping \nthese individuals may eliminate individuals who are heavily involved in volunteer activities or executives \n\u201con loan\u201d to a volunteer organization, we were unable to determine the nature of the outlying response. \nTo ensure robustness of our results, we ran the same analyses without dropping the highest 1% and with \ndropping individuals with the highest 5% of volunteer hours. Results from these analyses were consistent \nwith those presented here. \nGift Exchange and ESV      17 \nAmerica have a tendency to volunteer more than men (Wilson, 2000). Potentially, one\u2019s national origin or \nbackground \u201cmakes a difference to what kind of volunteer work people do\u201d (Wilson, 2000, p. 228).  \n These variables were measured as follows: Gender, coded \u201cMale\u201d as 1 and \u201cFemale\u201d as 0; Age, \n\u201c15-24,\u201d \u201c25-34,\u201d \u201c35-44,\u201d \u201c45-54,\u201d \u201c55-64,\u201d and \u201c65 years and older\u201d; coded each category as 1, \notherwise 0 with \u201c15-24\u201d as a reference category; Immigration status, if a respondent was born in Canada, \ncoded \u201cYes\u201d as 1 and \u201cNo\u201d as 0. \n Human, social, and cultural capital: Wilson and Musick (1997a) hypothesized that human, social, \nand cultural capital are related to one\u2019s volunteer choices. For human capital, they reported that both \neducation and income are positively related to volunteering and also found that individuals working more \nhours typically volunteer less. Human capital variables were measured as follows: Education, \u201cless than \nhigh school,\u201d \u201cgraduated from high school,\u201d \u201csome post secondary,\u201d \u201cpost secondary diploma,\u201d \n\u201cuniversity degree\u201d; coded each category as 1, otherwise 0 with \u201cless than high school\u201d as a reference \ncategory; Household income, \u201cless than $20,000,\u201d \u201c$20,000 to $40,000,\u201d \u201c$40,000 to $60,000,\u201d \u201c$60,000 \nto $100,000,\u201d and \u201cgreater than $100,000\u201d; coded each category as 1, otherwise 0 with \u201cless than \n$20,000\u201d as a reference category; and Working hours per week, \u201c30 to less than 40 hours,\u201d \u201c40 to less \nthan 50 hours,\u201d and \u201c50 hours or more\u201d with \u201cless than 30 hours\u201d as a reference category.  \n For social capital variables, we followed Wilson and Musick\u2019s (1997a) operationalizations using \nchildren present at home and marital status. Each has been determined to provide social networks that \nfacilitate volunteering. Social capital variables were measured as follows: Children at home under 18, \ncoded \u201cYes\u201d as 1 and \u201cNo\u201d as 0; and Marital status, coded \u201cMarried\u201d as 1 and \u201cSingle\u201d as 0. \n Cultural capital was measured using church attendance. Wilson and Musick (1997a) determined \nthat one\u2019s religiosity has a direct effect on one\u2019s volunteering. The question, \u201cHow often have you \nattended religious services or meetings,\u201d was reverse-coded such that 1 indicates \u201cNot at all\u201d and 5 \nindicates \u201cAt least once a week.\u201d  \n Occupation and volunteer organization categories: Wilson and Musick (1997b) argued that a \nconnection may exist between an individual\u2019s occupational choice and volunteering; certain job \nGift Exchange and ESV      18 \ncharacteristics may encourage individuals to be more involved in certain social activity. Further, \nindividuals who volunteered for religious or educational organizations appeared to volunteer more.   \nOccupational type included ten occupational types, such as management, sales and services, and \nhealth and was captured by nine dummy variables (management as reference type). Volunteer \norganization type included twelve organization types, such as culture, education, and health, and was \ncaptured by eleven dummy variables (cultural organization as reference type).\n2\n  \n Motivation: We based our measures of motivation on Knoke and Wright-Isak\u2019s (1982) taxonomy \n(i.e., rational choice, normative conformity, and affective bonding); \u201ca \u2018predisposition\/opportunity\u2019 model \nof the relationship between individual motives to contribute resources to organizations and organizational \nincentives to induce commitments\u201d (Knoke & Wright-Isak, 1982, p. 209). Rational choice presupposes \nthat the individual\u2019s decision making is driven by his\/her desire for utility maximization (Knoke, 1988; \nKnoke & Wright-Isak, 1982). An individual invokes normative conformity when his\/her behavior is based \non moral and value laden precedent or standard that society or his\/her group values and deems acceptable \n(Knoke, 1988; Knoke & Wright-Isak, 1982). Affective bonding, rooted within social interaction, explains \none\u2019s motivation to act given his\/her emotional connectedness to another or a group (Knoke, 1988; Knoke \n& Wright-Isak, 1982). \n We operationalized the three motivation variables as follows: Rational choice was measured by \ncombining three items asking reasons for volunteering related to professional development: (1) to \nimprove job opportunities; (2) to explore strengths; and (3) to use skills and experience. We coded \u201cyes\u201d \nas 1 otherwise 0, and aggregated each dummy variable. The variable ranged from 0 to 3, yielding a \nreliability coefficient of 0.49. Normative conformity was measured by three items that asked participants \n                                                 \n2\n Due to the fact that 1,203 individuals volunteered at more than one organization type, their memberships \nto the organization type were not mutually exclusive. Thus, we assigned those individuals to an \norganization type where they volunteered the longest hours. This can lead to loss of estimate precision. \nHowever, a tradeoff exists. An alternative way is to create dummy variables to make all the multiple \nmemberships to the twelve organization types exhaustive, which would result in many dummy variables. \nIn this paper, we believe that the first option is desirable, not only because it is simple, but also because it \nis not important to interpret, for example, that an individual who volunteered at both healthcare and \nreligious organizations volunteered 25 hours longer than an individual who volunteered at a healthcare \norganization only. \nGift Exchange and ESV      19 \nabout their exposure to volunteering when they were younger. The items are as follows: (1) Did you \npersonally see someone you admired helping others? (2) Were you helped in the past by others? (3) Did \none or both of your parents do volunteer work in the community? We coded \u201cyes\u201d as 1 otherwise 0. The \nvariable ranged from 0 to 3, yielding a reliability coefficient of 0.51. Affective bonding is based on a four \nitem index: how often do you socialize (1) with parents or other relatives and (2) with friends who live \noutside the neighborhood; and how often do you spend time (3) with friends participating in sports or \nrecreation activities; and (4) watching family members participate in sports or recreation activities. Items \nranged from 1 to 4, where 1 indicates \u201cevery week\u201d and 4 indicates \u201cnot at all.\u201d We reverse coded the \nitems and constructed one continuous variable, yielding its reliability coefficient of 0.50. \nCommon Method Bias  \n Given that our independent and dependent measures were collected from a single informant using \na single survey instrument, we were aware of the potential for common method variance (Podsakoff & \nOrgan, 1986). Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) offer procedural and statistical \nremedies. We considered these in determining the extent that our data possess common method bias. \nProcedural Remedies. The data were captured confidentially and disseminated to researchers \nanonymously; no participant can be identified (survey anonymity). Given that Statistics Canada had no \nrelation to the employer or the volunteer organizations, the participant should not have had incentive to \nunderstate or embellish responses (decreased evaluation apprehension). Another important characteristic \nis that measures were not asked in the sequence similar to our model (predictor & criterion measurement \nseparation). Additionally, the majority of variables (e.g., ESV benefits and hours volunteered) are factual \nitems and not attitudinal or perceptual items. Further, items throughout the survey (a) had familiar terms; \n(b) avoided unfamiliar nomenclature or syntax and provided examples if needed; and (c) kept short, \nsuccinct, focused items while avoiding double-barreled items (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Tourangeau, Rips, \n& Rasinski, 2000). Thus, scale item quality has also helped to diminish common method variance. \nStatistical Remedies. Following techniques outlined in Podsakoff and Organ (1986) and \nPodsakoff et al. (2003) to statistically estimate the extent of common method bias, we conducted \nGift Exchange and ESV      20 \nHarman\u2019s single-factor test using indicators from only our main variables of interest. As a result of the \nunrotated principal component analysis, common method bias does not seem problematic given there was \nno general factor. The first factor accounted for 11.46% and does not account for the majority of the \nvariance. However, Podsakoff et al. (2003) have suggested that Harman\u2019s method is a weak detection tool.  \nThough detection tools are limited for formative measure models, another option is to conduct a \npartial correlation adjustment, where a marker variable that is theoretically unrelated to at least one other \nvariable in a study (preferably the dependent variable) can be used to control for common method \nvariance (Lindell & Whitney, 2001). We used the amount of financial giving that the respondent gave in \nthe past twelve months as the marker variable. Although donations can relate to volunteer hours, we \nbelieve that there is no theoretical reason for it to relate to the dependent variables, employer\u2019s \nrecognition and perception of job success. Our data showed a small positive correlation (r=0.10, p<0.001) \nbetween giving and hours. Given the positive correlations, partialling out the variance shared by them will \nresult in lower correlations among the variables of interest, therefore providing conservative correlation \nestimates. All significant zero-order correlations remained significant after the partial correlation \nadjustment, suggesting that common method bias is not a serious problem (Lindell & Whitney, 2001).  \nResults \nTable 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for the key variables. \nThe zero-order correlations suggest preliminary support for the hypotheses. Time oriented and \nfinancial\/logistic oriented benefits were positively associated with hours volunteered (r = .14, and r = .09, \nrespectively), hours volunteered was positively associated with skills acquired from volunteering (r = \n0.24), and skills acquired was positively associated with employer\u2019s recognition of employee volunteering \n(r = 0.16) and employee job success perceptions (r = 0.33). They were all significant at the 0.001 level. A \ncomprehensive correlation table with all control variables can be obtained from the authors upon request. \n Insert Table 1 about here  \n \nGift Exchange and ESV      21 \nTo examine how ESV benefits were associated with our key variables, we split the sample into \ntwo groups: those who received ESV benefits for the last 12 months and those who did not. Table 2 \ndisplays the results from the mean-difference test of these two groups. The results showed a remarkable \ndifference: all the key variables were significantly higher for employees who received ESV benefits than \nfor employees who did not receive ESV benefits. The effect sizes suggest that these differences are \nmoderate to large (Cohen, 1969; Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991); d = 0.23 (hours volunteered); d = 0.39 \n(skills acquired); d = 0.78 (employer\u2019s recognition); and d = 0.37 (job success). The effect size indicates \nthat 1.3% of the variance in hours volunteered; 3.7% of the variance in skills acquired; 13.2% of the \nvariance in employer\u2019s recognition; and 3.3% of the variance in job success is accounted for by \nemployees that receive ESV benefits versus employees that do not. \nFurther investigation by splitting the group with ESV benefits into three groups (i.e., those who \nreceived the time oriented ESV benefits only, and the financial\/logistic ESV benefits only, and both) \nconfirmed the additive effect of ESV benefits (available from authors upon request). That is, all the key \nvariables were significantly higher for employees who received both types of ESV benefits than for \nemployees who received either type of ESV benefits. \n Insert Table 2 about here  \n \nTable 3 reports the results from hierarchical regression analyses testing our hypotheses.\n3\n Model 1 \nand 2 show that in accordance with Hypothesis 1, employees who received time oriented and \nfinancial\/logistic oriented volunteering benefits from employers were more likely to engage in more hours \nof volunteering (b=24.23, p<0.001, and b=11.69, p<0.05, respectively), after other factors were accounted \n(\u0394F=31.18, p<0.001). More specifically, the ESV benefit coefficients in Model 2 indicate that for each \nadditional unit of time oriented ESV benefits, volunteer hours increase by 24 hours, and that for each \n                                                 \n3\n Since the dependent variable, volunteer hours, was left-censored, Tobit regression is a correct statistical \napproach for Model 1and 2. The results from the Tobit regressions were virtually identical to the OLS \nresults, and thus, we tabulated the OLS results for comparison purposes to Model 3 and 4. \nGift Exchange and ESV      22 \nadditional unit of financial\/logistic oriented ESV benefits, volunteer hours increase by 12 hours. Thus, \ntaken together, volunteer hours increase by 36 hours. \nModel 3 and 4 support Hypothesis 2. Hours for volunteering significantly increased the level of \nskill acquisition (b=0.0017, p<0.001) after the effect of time oriented and financial\/logistic oriented \nvolunteering benefits was partialled out (\u0394F=112.72, p<0.001). For every additional 100 volunteer hours, \nthe number of reported skills acquired increases by 0.17.  \nThe results from logistic regression show strong support for Hypotheses 3a and 3b. For example, \nemployees who acquire skills from volunteering increased the likelihood of feeling successful on the job \n(b=0.36, p<0.001) in Model 6, and the likelihood of being recognized by the employer (b=0.12, p<0.001) \nin Model 8. In other words, reports of acquiring one unit of skills increases the likelihood of reporting \nbeing recognized by the employer by 12 percent and the likelihood of reporting feeling successful on the \njob is increased by 43 percent. The \u03c72-difference test shows that skills acquired from volunteering have \nadditional explanatory power after other factors were controlled (p<0.001).  \n Insert Table 3 about here  \n \nRobustness checks for these results revealed that they were not driven by statistical artifacts. \nRepeating the analyses using the Huber-White estimator of variance that is valid under the presence of \nheteroskedasticity suggested nearly identical results. Finally, we checked robustness of our results by \nusing the logarithmic transformation of volunteer hours (Freeman, 1997). Results were highly consistent.  \nSupplemental Analyses \n From our hypotheses, one may infer a mediating process for hours volunteered and skills \nacquired. A priori, we did not hypothesize mediation; we solely hypothesized main effects. However, \npost-hoc, for exploratory purposes, we conducted path analysis to discern mediation. We ran structural \nequation modeling using the partial least squares (PLS) technique, PLS-Graph for Windows 3.0 beta \nversion (Chin, 2001, 2003). For models with formative measures, PLS is a suited approach for path \nmodeling given that other techniques have difficulty with identification of formative measures (Chin, \nGift Exchange and ESV      23 \n1998). The precision of the model\u2019s path coefficients are determined using a bootstrapping procedure that \nallows for t-statistic calculation (utilizing 500 resamples generated with 3,658 cases per sample). In our \nstudy, the path coefficients were significant and suggested the mediating nature of volunteer hours and \nskills acquired (Time Oriented ESV Benefits\u2192Volunteer Hours, path coefficient=0.14, p<0.001; \nFinancial\/Logistic Oriented ESV Benefits\u2192Volunteer Hours, path coefficient=0.08, p<0.01; Volunteer \nHours\u2192Skills Acquired, path coefficient=0.25, p<0.001; Skills Acquired\u2192Job Success, path \ncoefficient=0.34, p<0.001; Skills Acquired\u2192Recognition, path coefficient=0.15, p<0.001). Further, these \nresults also supported our hypotheses and were similar to our previous analyses.  \n In addition, one might posit that there are limits to the benefits accrued through volunteering. \nCertainly, if an employee spends excessive hours volunteering, skill acquisition may meet diminishing \nreturns. More hours volunteering may not always benefit the employer and employees. A supplemental \nanalysis tested this possibility with the inclusion of a curvilinear term for volunteer hours in Model 4 \npredicting skills. The squared term for hours volunteering was significantly negatively related to skill \nacquisition, indicating a curvilinear relationship and the existence of an optimal level of hours for \nvolunteering in skill acquisition. As seen in Figure 1, our computation of the critical point indicated that \nvolunteer hours exceeding 587 hours a year, which is equivalent to 73, 8-hour days of volunteering (1.4 \ndays per week), does not acquire additional skills. In interpreting this result, we must consider that this is \na relationship between number of volunteer hours and the number of skills acquired, not the overall depth \nof skill acquisition. Thus, it may be that those who volunteer more hours develop fewer skills at greater \ndepth. \n Insert Figure 1 about here  \n   \nDiscussion and Conclusion \n In contrast to the often studied dyadic relationship between the volunteer and the volunteer \norganization, we explored the exchange relationships between the employer and the employee and \nbetween the employee and the volunteer organization that are initiated by the employer offering ESV \nGift Exchange and ESV      24 \nbenefits to its employees. Gift exchange theory, a social exchange theory derivative, was used to describe \nthe nature of the relationships. This current research stands as one of the first theoretical treatments of the \noperation of ESV benefits in the literature.  \nFurther, we empirically tested these gift exchange relationships via the employee perceptions of \nESV receipt, hours volunteered, human capital acquisition, job success and volunteer recognition \nmeasures. Given our illustrative data, our empirical findings provided preliminary support that ESV \nbenefits facilitate exchange relationships as hypothesized. First, we found that ESV benefits positively \ninfluence an employee\u2019s volunteer hours. This result suggests that though providing ESV benefits is \ncostly to employers, an employer who provides more volunteer benefits helps its employees minimize \ncosts and challenges associated with volunteering, and, consequently, employees volunteer more hours. \nVolunteer organizations benefit indirectly from ESV benefits by receiving more volunteer hours and \npotentially achieve savings given the increased hours provided by employees from the employer.   \n Next, we found that volunteering more hours was associated with more perceived skills acquired \nfrom volunteering, after accounting for ESV benefits employees received. Though we are unable to \nprovide the exact cost-benefit calculi, the finding suggests that providing ESV benefits may be another, \nperhaps more efficient, route to skill acquisition. That is, the employer may reduce training costs by \nproviding ESV benefits that facilitate employees learning skills through their volunteer experiences. \nVolunteer experiences may result in additional positive byproducts such as employee retention and \ncommunity reputation. However, more hours of volunteering may not always be beneficial. Our \npreliminary analysis suggests that the relationship between hours volunteered and number of skills \nacquired may be curvilinear; increased volunteering leads to an increase in perceived number of skills \nacquired, but only up to a point.  \nOur results with regard to a volunteer\u2019s workplace socioeconomic achievement also support our \nhypotheses. Specifically, we found that individuals who report acquiring skills from volunteering are \nmore likely to report being recognized by their employer and ultimately report feeling more successful on \nthe job. Judge, Higgins, Thoreson, and Barrick (1999) suggested that it is imperative to an organization\u2019s \nGift Exchange and ESV      25 \nperformance for its employees to feel accomplished, rewarded, and successful. Similarly, for the \nvolunteer organization, a more satisfied volunteer workforce that experiences achievement and success \nmay likely continue its service and promote improved performance. Our results suggest that \naccomplishments resulting from volunteering may achieve such organizational goals.   \nLimitations and Future Directions \nOur study has several limitations stemming from both the data analyzed as well as the nature of \nour research question. First, though our theory posits causal relationships, the cross-sectional nature of the \n2000 NSGVP does not allow a test of causal hypotheses and raises the possibility of reverse causality. For \nexample, perceptions of skill acquisition and job success may have led participants to volunteer more \nhours. However, because ESVs and employer recognition are reported in a more objective fashion and not \nsubject to individual attempts to change them, proposals of reverse relationships are less likely. Future \nresearch can address these issues using a longitudinal data set. \nSecond, common method bias and social desirability are concerns. In a survey that is geared \ntoward volunteering, participating, and giving, one may feel that he\/she should reply in ways that is \nsocially desirable, and consequently, the observed correlations of the variables may be artificially inflated. \nAll the data are also collected from one source, raising common method bias concerns. However, given \nthe procedural and statistical approaches we used to evaluate this issue, we are confident that the extent of \ncommon method biases in these data is not extensive and not wholly responsible for these results. Future \nresearch examining these relationships should utilize data collected from all parties engaged in the \nexchanges. This would not only combat the issue of single source data, but also would represent a better \nmatch between gift exchange theory and empirical data.  \nThird, because we used an existing dataset, we were constrained to using the items available \nwhich were not specifically designed to test our theory. For example, many of the items were measured \ndichotomously and assessed only the presence of, rather than level of, ESV benefits and skills acquired. \nThe measure of hours of volunteering may not capture fully the nature and complexities of the volunteer \nexperience. Further, we were unable to examine if ESV benefits influence the individual\u2019s decision to \nGift Exchange and ESV      26 \nvolunteer, as individuals who were not volunteering were not asked to respond to questions about ESV \nbenefits. Future research can examine these issues by collecting more detailed information on ESV \nbenefits, the nature of the volunteer experience, skill development, and outcomes from both non-\nvolunteers and volunteers.  \n Finally, our findings may not be generalizable outside of Canada; volunteering and ESV benefits \nmay be influenced by cultural perspectives. Although surveys suggest an increase in the number of \nemployers providing ESV benefits globally, culture-specific factors may create dynamics that are \ndifferent from those exchanges we investigated in this paper. Future studies exploring the presence and \npatterns of volunteering and ESV benefits in different cultures would be valuable. \n Despite the limitations of the data, we feel the representativeness of the sample and the scarcity of \nempirical work on this topic suggest that use of this dataset is reasonable to develop preliminary findings \nin this emerging area. Schmitt (1994) supports this idea, proposing that the appropriateness of methods \nand measures should be based upon the particular body of research\u2019s stage of development. He states, \u201cI \nthink it is appropriate to use methods and research designs in a newly developing area that would be \nunacceptable in another area of research\u201d (p. 395). As stated earlier, ESV research is at a nascent stage.  \n In addition to the suggestions for future directions flowing from the limitations detailed above, \nwe also offer conceptual ideas for further work. Future research might examine the linkages between \nother gifts in this broader exchange such as personnel retention and improved customer and community \nperceptions for the employer, personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment for \nthe employee, and accomplishment of objectives for the volunteer organization. From a more practical \nperspective, future research might examine which skills are more effectively\/efficiently developed \nthrough volunteering versus traditional training and development. Thoughtful, empirically based \napproaches to matching employees with volunteer experiences to promote development would provide \ngreater benefit to employers and employees rather than skill acquisition as a byproduct of the volunteer \nexperience. \nGift Exchange and ESV      27 \n Future research might also investigate whether there is a dark side to ESV. Some have argued that \nemployer involvement in volunteering may change the nature of the volunteer motivations and non-profit \nmissions (Tschirhart & St. Clair, 2005). For example, is volunteering becoming non-voluntary as \norganizations increasingly encourage participation? If so, then are volunteers acting in the interest of the \nnon-profit or self-interest? Will non-profits modify their projects and objectives to make them more \npalatable to organizational participation? Will some causes be left behind as organizations play a larger \nrole in volunteer activities? These issues are important to consider as the work of non-profits and private \nsector employers become more tightly coupled.  \nPractical Implications \nOur paper has important implications for employers. Specifically, our results suggest that benefits \nfor the employer, in the form of skill acquisition, may result from the provision of ESV programs. Thus, \nemployers would be wise to direct their efforts strategically so they can enhance their benefits received \nthat result from their gifts of ESV benefits. For example, a skill-matching alliance would benefit \nemployers and volunteer organizations and crystallize the exchange predicted from our gift exchange \ntheory. The employer can create relationships with volunteer organizations that adequately train its \nemployees with appropriate skills (or other outcomes) instead of the employer directly providing human \ncapital investment to its employees. The employer may find it necessary to create alliances with multiple \nvolunteer organizations (i.e., a portfolio of multiple relationships) to adequately provide enriching \nexperiences for its diverse employee population that may have differing skill level needs and \nbackgrounds. Further, as mentioned earlier, recent surveys have established that new workforce entrants \n(e.g., Generation Y) may expect employers to provide ESV benefits, and, thus, these benefits may provide \na competitive advantage to employers in hiring new employees. Additionally, these programs and benefits \nmay be a tool for retention. This suggests the critical role of ESV benefits policy to create feasible \nprograms that satisfy the joint needs of the employer and employee. \nOur findings have implications for volunteer organizations as well. Specifically, the provisions of \nESV benefits by an employer are associated with increased volunteer hours. For the volunteer \nGift Exchange and ESV      28 \norganization, our findings provide an empirical justification for volunteer organizations to market the \ngains to employers from being involved in the community. Volunteer organizations should identify the \nskill(s) that can be delivered to employees and can market itself to employers who have interest in \nbuilding partnerships that value such skills.  \nIn addition to the volunteer hours received, the volunteer organization also benefits by receiving \nquality workers without significant recruitment, selection and retention expenses. Govekar and Govekar \n(2002) stated that \u201cvolunteer labor is not free, for the organization must train volunteers and supervise \nthem, which require the work of paid labor to run a volunteer program; given such costs, an organization \nis not likely to accept all of the volunteers who wish to work for it\u201d (p. 43). Thus, a volunteer organization \nrequires the best volunteers to meet its mission. One important advantage of partnerships with employers \nis that the volunteer organization receives workers from the employer that have already been through the \nemployer\u2019s recruitment and selection process; the \u201cbad apples\u201d have been weeded out by the employer. \nAdditionally, the employer\u2019s ability to retain its employees via ESV benefits may also be advantageous to \nthe volunteer organization as general and specific volunteer knowledge will not be lost and more \nintegrative relationships can be formed (Points of Light Foundation and the Center for Corporate \nCitizenship, 2005). \nConclusion \n To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind combining theoretical development and \nempirical investigation of ESV benefits. Based in gift exchange theory, we propose that reciprocal gift-\nexchange relationships are initiated via the offering of ESV benefits. In addition, using a large, nationally \nrepresentative sample, we empirically test an application of the theory. Results suggest the provision of \nESV benefits is positively associated with increased volunteer hours. Increased volunteer hours are \npositively associated with greater skill acquisition \u2013 a benefit to the individual and employer. Reports of \nskill acquisition are positively associated with reports of being recognized at work and perceptions of job \nsuccess. These theoretical and empirical contributions have management implications for both the \nemployer and the volunteer organization.\nGift Exchange and ESV      29 \nReferences \nAkerlof, G. A. (1982).
