Res. Lett., 37, L16102,\ndoi:10.1029\/2010GL043989.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The formation of the quiet\u2010time slot region between the\nEarth\u2019s inner (\u223c 1.3 < L <\u223c 2.5) and outer (\u223c 3 < L <\u223c 7)\nelectron radiation belts can be accounted for by a balance\nbetween Earthward radial transport and pitch\u2010angle scattering\nloss of energetic electrons to the atmosphere caused by\nplasmaspheric whistler\u2010mode hiss [Lyons and Thorne, 1973].\nIn the vicinity of the slot region and radiation belts, electrons\nare in the energy range 0.01\u201310 MeV [Boscher and Bourdarie,\n2001]. Protons of energy tens to hundreds of keV are dis-\ntributed more or less continuously from the inner to outer\nbelts and contribute to the ring current formation.\n[3] During the main and early recovery phases of a mag-\nnetic storm the slot region can be filled with energetic elec-\ntrons [Thorne et al., 2007]. Loto\u2019aniu et al. [2006] demon-\nstrated filling of the slot region by drift resonance between\nultra low\u2010frequency (ULF) waves and electrons, while Shprits\net al. [2006] showed that local acceleration by very low\u2010\nfrequency (VLF) waves can also contribute to slot\u2010region\nfilling.\n[4] Whistler\u2010mode chorus waves can accelerate electrons\nlocally outside the plasmapause [Summers et al., 1998;Horne\net al., 2003], which can be eroded during a storm down to\nthe nominal slot region (L \u223c 2) [Shprits et al., 2006]. Fluc-\ntuating substorm\u2010associated convection E\u2010fields are expected\nto transport \u223c100 keV electrons into the slot region [Liu et al.,\n2003]. Almost all previous studies have dealt only with the\nfilling of the slot\u2010region during geomagnetic storms.\n[5] In this study we report for the first time the injection of\nquasi\u2010trapped electrons (100\u223c400 keV) into the slot region\nduring a non\u2010stormtime substorm, which occurred well after\nthe recovery phase of a medium\u2010size (Dst \u223c \u2212100 nT) storm.\nThe results are discussed in detail in Section 3, and summa-\nrized in Section 4.\n2. Observations\n[6] STSAT\u20101 is a Korean satellite on a sun\u2010synchronous\n(1040\u20132240 LT) circular (altitude\u223c680 km) orbit [Lee et al.,\n2005]. It has two Solid\u2010State Telescopes (SST) directed\nparallel and perpendicular to the local geomagnetic field, with\nan acceptance angle of 34\u00b0. SST employs silicon detectors\n(300 m thick) to measure local electron fluxes in the energy\nrange between 100 and 400 keV. Aluminum\u2010coated LEXAN\nfoils (0.15 m thick) are placed at the apertures to stop protons,\nbut a certain degree of proton contamination is still expected\nas SST adopts a similar structure to that of Medium Energy\nProton and Electron Detector (MEPED) on board the NOAA\u2010\nPOES satellites. Nevertheless, we expect a substantial con-\ntribution to measured fluxes comes from the electrons (see\ndiscussions below) while the amount of proton contamination\ncannot be estimated in\u2010situ due to the lack of an independent\nproton telescope on STSAT\u20101.\n[7] Figure 1a shows observations of STSAT\u20101 on 24\nFebruary 2004. The day was in a nonstorm period with a\nminimum Dst (maximum Kp) value of \u221228 nT (3.3), and\ntemporally well\u2010separated from the main phase of the pre-\nvious storm on 11 February. In Figure 1 the abscissa is the\nuniversal time. Figures 1 (top) and 1 (bottom) are spectro-\ngrams of quasitrapped (pitch angle \u223c 90\u00b0) and precipitating\n(pitch angle \u223c 0\u00b0) radiation\u2010belt electrons (100\u223c400 keV),\nrespectively.\n1Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and\nTechnology, Daejeon, South Korea.\n2GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences, Potsdam,\nGermany.\n3Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Memorial University of\nNewfoundland, St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada.\n4School of Space Research, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South\nKorea.\n5Solar and Space Weather Research Group, Korea Astronomy and\nSpace Science Institute, Daejeon, South Korea.\n6British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n7Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Kyushu University,\nFukuoka, Japan.\n8Space Weather Prediction Center, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL043989\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L16102, doi:10.1029\/2010GL043989, 2010\nL16102 1 of 5\n[8] Figure 1 (top) shows quasi\u2010trapped electrons form\nthree distinct belts on the nightside. The flux peak of the\nequatorward belt seems to be located beyond the nightside\nobservation limit of STSAT\u20101 (at 11:44:58 UT, L \u223c 2.4),\ncorresponding to the location of the inner radiation belt. The\nL\u2010shell value calculated at the flux peak of the poleward belt\n(around 11:40:57 UT) is \u223c5.2, which is consistent with the\nknown location of the outer radiation belt. Between the two\nbelts, where a region devoid of energetic particles (the slot\nregion) is expected, appears a population of electrons (at\n11:42:57 UT, L \u223c 3.4), which we refer to as the \u201cinjection\u201d.\n[9] Figure 1 (bottom) shows the precipitating electron flux,\nwhose structure is quite different from that of the quasi\u2010\ntrapped electrons. Noticeable precipitation exists only around\n11:40:57UT at the outer belt of quasi\u2010trapped electrons. After\n1 minute, a much weaker precipitation was observed between\nthe outer belt and the injection.\n[10] Figures 1b and 1c show similar plots on the previous\nand following days. The observed longitudes and magnetic\nlocal times (MLTs) are nearly the same as those of Figure 1a.\nNo injection can be found in Figure 1a (top). STSAT\u20101\nconducted polar observations only for 3 passes per day in\nFebruary 2004. However, only the last pass on each day had\ngood field\u2010aligned attitude and full latitudinal coverage, and\nis shown in Figure 1.\n[11] In 2004 three NOAA\u2010POES satellites observed the\nradiation belt at an altitude of \u223c800 km. A 90o telescope of\nMEPED detects quasi\u2010trapped particles with an acceptance\nangle of 30\u00b0 [Rodger et al., 2010], similar to that of STSAT\u20101\/\nSST. In the inner belt and the slot region (L < 4) such low\u2010\naltitude instruments may encounter stably trapped particles\njust within a small longitude range around the South Atlantic\nAnomaly (SAA) (http:\/\/www.altfuels.org\/sampex). In the\nother regions they only observe particles in the drift loss\ncone (DLC); quasi\u2010trapped.\n[12] In Figure 2 quasi\u2010trapped electron (proton) flux in the\nenergy range >100 keV (80\u2013240 keV) is plotted in linear\nscale as solid (dashed) lines. Black (red) color corresponds to\nthe northern (southern) hemisphere. To avoid proton con-\ntamination [Rodger et al., 2010], proton flux between 240 and\n6900 keV has been subtracted from the raw electron flux.\nFigures 2 (left) and 2 (right) relate to the midnight\u2010dawn\u2010\nnoon and noon\u2010dusk\u2010midnight sectors, respectively. The\nslot region is located at L \u223c 3 \u2212 4. In the region POES 15, 16,\nand 17 observed injection at \u223c10:51 UT, \u223c11:01\u201314:23 UT,\nand \u223c10:47 UT, respectively. Each electron flux enhance-\nment was accompanied with that of proton flux. STSAT\u20101\nobserved injection at \u223c11:43 UT. Therefore, the injection\nseems to have lasted at least from 10:50 UT (POES 17)\nto 14:23 UT (POES 16). However, it was observed only\nfrom the noon to midnight sector. Dramatically, POES 16\nat \u223c11:30 UT (\u223c14:00 LT) and STSAT\u20101 at \u223c11:43 UT\n(\u223c22:30 LT) observed injection while POES 16 at \u223c11:51 UT\n(\u223c03:00 LT) barely observed it. After 11:44UT, faint electron\ninjection is observed only around the SAA, where POES can\nobserve electrons with larger equatorial pitch angle (more\nstably\u2010trapped electrons).\n3. Discussion\n[13] Energetic (\u223c100\u2013300 keV) electrons\/protons in DLC\nwere observed in the low\u2010altitude (680 \u223c 800 km altitude) slot\nregion for several hours. We are not sure that >300 keV\nelectrons also existed in the slot region because correspond-\ning MEPED data are contaminated by proton flux. One may\nsuppose that the particles are a remnant of the slot\u2010region\nfilling by the storm on 11 February, which filled the slot\nregion with energetic electrons as can be seen in the POES\nsummary plots (http:\/\/poes.ngdc.noaa.gov). However, the\nslot region slowly reforms in the POES data when the region\nFigure 1. STSAT\u20101 observations on (a) 24, (b) 23, and (c) 25 February 2004: spectrograms of (top) quasi\u2010trapped and\n(bottom) precipitating radiation\u2010belt electrons as observed by SST.\nPARK ET AL.: NON\u2010STORMTIME SLOT\u2010REGION INJECTION L16102L16102\n2 of 5\nis nearly devoid of energetic electrons around 24 February.\nThe slot region observed by STSAT\u20101 on 23 February\n(Figure 1b) was also empty. Therefore, we deduce that the\ninjection on 24 February cannot be a remnant of the previous\nstorm. Though whistler\u2010mode chorus waves can fill the\nslot region with energetic electrons [Shprits et al., 2006],\nwe should note that they can also induce scattering loss of\n<500 keV electrons [Summers et al., 2002, 2007]; they cannot\nexplain our observations.\n[14] A relatively strong substorm occurred at 09:40 and\n10:10 UT on 24 February (Figure 3a). Substorms are asso-\nciated with large zonal electric fields transporting plasma\ntoward the Earth [Liu et al., 2003]. If this process conserves\nthe first invariant, both electrons and protons transported\nfrom L = 10 to L = 3 can have substantial increase in energy.\nFor a dipole field, energy increases in proportion to L\u22123\nleading to an increase in energy by a factor of \u223c 40. Model-\ning work by Liu et al. [2003] suggests that locally enhanced\nE\u2010field (\u223c 2 mV\/m) in the inner magnetosphere can fill the\nslot region with \u223c100 keV electrons.\n[15] Sergeev et al. [1998] observed zonal E\u2010field of\n1.2mV\/m at L \u223c 5 around a substorm onset.Ganushkina et al.\n[2000] observed fast inward ion injection (2RE during 1 hour)\nand attributed it to local inductive E\u2010field exceeding 1 mV\/m.\nHence, substorm E\u2010field as the origin of injection seems\nplausible. Unfortunately, we have no observational profile\nof substorm E\u2010field during our event.\n[16] Liu et al. [2003] also suggested that fluctuating E\u2010field\ncan result in higher slot\u2010region electron flux than static\nE\u2010field. Loto\u2019aniu et al. [2006] reported ULF waves of\n\u223c200 nT p\u2010 p in the slot region during the 2003 Halloween\nstorm. They estimated the radial diffusion time to be 12\u2013\n24 hours at L \u223c3. We checked ULF activity observed by\nthe Circum\u2010pan Pacific Magnetometer Network (CPMN)\nobservatories: Zyryanka (ZYK, L \u223c 3.97) and Magadan\n(MGD, L \u223c 2.87). Amplitude of ULF waves were of the order\nof 10 nT p\u2010p (figure not shown). Though ULF waves on\n24 February 2004 were much weaker than those of the\nHalloween 2003 storm, high\u2010m (azimuthal wave number)\nULF waves, which cannot be observed on the ground, may\nhave contributed to electron acceleration. It is also possible\nthat electron flux just below the SST energy range (\u223c 70 keV)\nhad been high and that electrons were accelerated by the\nULF wave enhancements. More observations are needed to\nclarify this point.\n[17] The MLT dependence seen in POES warrants further\ndiscussion. In Figures 3b and 3c filled (blank) circles relate to\nfilled (empty) slot region, and black (red) color to northern\nFigure 2.

Filling of DLC is assumed to be\nactive in the yellow\u2010shaded region, which signifies a region\nof enhanced hiss during active times [Meredith et al., 2004].\nThe green\u2010shaded (hatched) region signifies the SAA (local\nnighttime). Injection was observed by POES and STSAT\u20101\nfrom noon to midnight, but not in the other sector. Outside the\nSAA, slot\u2010region electrons observed byMEPED are in DLC;\nthey are permanently lost in the SAA. In other words, wave\u2010\ninduced pitch\u2010angle scattering should fill DLC continuously\nto make electrons reach the POES altitude. We assume the\nfollowing scenario. Due to eastward (westward) drift during\ninward injection, stably trapped electrons (ions) enter the\nslot region mainly in the post\u2010 (pre\u2010)midnight sector. Elec-\ntrons keep drifting eastward and safely pass the SAA.\nPlasmaspheric hiss is generally active (inactive) on the\nday\u2010to\u2010evening (post\u2010midnight) sector for disturbed (quiet)\ngeomagnetic conditions [Meredith et al., 2004]. The electrons\nare scattered into DLC by such waves and reach the altitudes\nof POES or STSAT\u20101. Electron pitch angles keep decreas-\ning until local midnight so that the electrons are lost to the\natmosphere.\n[18] After 11:44 UT POES observed no injection outside\nthe SAA; e.g., POES 15 (17) at 12:04 (11:58) UT.Only POES\n16 near the SAA, where MEPED may reach stably trapped\nparticles, observed faint signatures of injected electrons until\n14:23 UT. Possibly, injected particle flux and pitch angle\nscattering became much weaker after 11:44 UT. Ions drift\nin the opposite direction to electrons. electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC) waves, which also exhibit maximum\nactivity from noon to midnight [Meredith et al., 2003], can\nscatter \u223c100 keV protons [Xiao et al., 2009] into DLC. Ions\nare finally lost around the SAA at noon. In all, the observed\ninjection seems to be intermittent imprints of equatorially\ntrapped particles onto DLC. However, it is not impossible\nthat the slot region had no equatorially trapped electrons\nand that injection originates from the radial drift of inner\u2010\/\nouter\u2010belt electrons already in DLC. Further observations of\nthe high\u2010\/low\u2010altitude slot region are needed to confirm our\nspeculation.\n[19] Visually inspecting the MEPED data in 2004 we\nfound several other occasions when all the three POES\nsatellites encountered injections during a non\u2010stormtime\nperiod: 05 June, 27 June and 04 October. Though all the\nevents occurred during\/after substorms, high AE does not\nalways guarantee injection. For example, on 05 June a sub-\nstorm occurred preceding to injection; the maximum AE\nindex was \u223c400 nT. On 04 June, though the maximum AE\nindex exceeded 600 nT, no injection was encountered by\nPOES. According to Ganushkina et al. [2000], even a mod-\nerate substorm (AE \u223c 150 \u2212 200 nT) can sometimes inject ions\ndeep into the inner magnetosphere. As extensive observations\nof substorm E\u2010field were unavailable for those occasions,\nthe exact mechanism of particle injection cannot as yet be\nfully determined. In our next study, we will extend the data\nset and search for conjugate observations of POES with\nhigh\u2010altitude satellite constellations such as THEMIS.\n4. Summary and Conclusions\n[20] From a coordinated, multi\u2010instrument case study\nof Earth\u2019s radiation\u2010belt slot region, we have found the\nfollowing:\n[21] 1. On 24 February 2004, STSAT\u20101 and POES\nobserved a population of quasi\u2010trapped protons and electrons\n(\u223c100 keV) between the inner and outer radiation belts. Its\nlifetime was shorter than a day. This appears to be the first\nobservation of an injection of \u223c100 keV electrons into the slot\nregion during a non\u2010stormtime substorm.\n[22] 2. Localized enhancement of substorm E\u2010field may\nexplain the particle injection, but more in\u2010situ observations\nare needed to verify it.\n[23] 3. CPMN stations observed small enhancements of\nULF waves, which seem insufficient to generate the particle\ninjection. However, it is possible that higher azimuthal modes\nFigure 3.

The green\u2010shaded (hatched) region\nsignifies the SAA (local nighttime).\nPARK ET AL.: NON\u2010STORMTIME SLOT\u2010REGION INJECTION L16102L16102\n4 of 5\nthat are not observed on the ground may have contributed to\nthe injection.\n[24] 4. The electron injection was observed by POES from\nnoon to midnight MLT, while it was not observed in the post\u2010\nmidnight sector. Weaker plasmaspheric hiss after midnight\nmay have prevented equatorially\u2010trapped electrons from\nreaching POES, which generally observes the drift loss cone.\n[25] Until now, slot\u2010region filling has been investigated\nonly for stormtime and MeV electrons. However, our\nobservations show that the slot region is not a safe zone in\nnon\u2010storm periods, but several\u2010hundred keV electrons can be\ninjected into the slot region. An important ramification of\nnon\u2010stormtime electron injection into the slot region is that\nthis reinforces the suggestion that substorm activity is more\nimportant than storm activity for inducing energetic electron\nevents [e.g., Hwang et al., 2004]. Further, the observa-\ntion poses an important challenge for modeling substorm\u2010\nassociated electrodynamics in the inner magnetosphere.\n[26] Acknowledgments.
