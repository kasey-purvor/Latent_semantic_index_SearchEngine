We do not, though, simply discover facts as \nlawyers nor do clients simply present narratives that require legal interpretation. \nRather, fact production is a co-authored and creative process whereby the facts of a \ndispute are socially constructed by the parties. This paper shows any interaction in a \nlegal setting that establishes facts is a complex phenomenon and is influenced by \nvarious factors such as the setting, role expectations of the parties, and the course of \nthe interaction. This is shown through an examination of one aspect of the fact \nproduction process, the act of complaining. \n \nThe data we explore on complaining originates from a study on the Licensing Act \n2003. Early data collection indicated that those who objected to licence applications \ndid so in a specific manner, often by denying that they were objecting. Intrigued by \nthis, we examined socio-linguistic literature on complaining to discover if this \nprovided any insights into how individuals frame complaints. The literature showed \nthat complaining is often effected through adoption of specific strategies, the uptake \nof which could be influenced by factors such as those mentioned in the preceding \nparagraph (setting etc), and, armed with this framework, we analysed the data \ncollected from those who objected to licence applications. We found that many of the \n \n3 \nstrategies highlighted in the literature were adopted by objectors. So, while making an \neffective complaint appears to be the main focus of objectors, we see how politeness \nmay mitigate, in certain circumstances, the effectiveness of a complaint. Furthermore, \nin different settings objectors frame their complaints in subtly different ways. \nComplaints in letters, for instance, appear to be different from complaints generated in \ninterviews and these were different again from those expressed in hearings before \nlicensing sub-committees. This has implications for how we understand the fact \nproduction process and what it means to gather \u2018evidence\u2019 from those engaged in a \nlegal dispute. \n \nIn setting out our findings, we will initially describe the wider project from which this \npaper originates, the methods adopted and our approach to data analysis. From here \nwe will examine the relevant literature explored to better understand the data. Rather \nthan providing an overly broad account of the literature, we have restricted our \nexposition to sources that offered fruitful lines of enquiry in the data. This is \nconsidered in section 4 below and takes in the work of Yaeger-Dror on the \u201cCognitive \nProminence Principle\u201d and the \u201cSocial Agreement Principle\u201d, [24] Brown and \nLevinson\u2019s seminal work on \u201cface,\u201d [2] Edwards\u2019 work on the \u201csubjective side of \ncomplaining\u201d[4] and Boxer\u2019s work on \u201cindirect complaints\u201d [1]. After this literature \nreview we present the data from our study. We have organised our findings into four \nmain categories: performing the act of complaining; the adoption of politeness \nstrategies; interaction and complaints; and the importance of context and setting. We \nshow how the act of complaining is the main focus of objectors, yet politeness \nstrategies are still adopted by them. Furthermore, we show how complaints are framed \nwithin an interaction, with the consequences that interactional dynamics may result in \n \n4 \nobjectors weakening their cases, and how complaints are framed differently when \nexpressed in different settings. We conclude by exploring a number of implications \nfrom the study e.g. consistency in testimony if complaints shift subtly in different \ncontexts. Finally we consider reasons why the data appears to show that the priority \nfor objectors is the framing of effective complaints rather than the adoption of \npoliteness strategies. At first glance, this may appear to be an obvious finding, but the \nliterature suggested that politeness strategies would be far more prevalent than we \nfound. \n \n2 Methodology \n \nThe data for this paper was taken from a wider study on the operation of the Licensing \nAct 2003. The purpose of this study was to explore how the Act regulates three forms \nof \u201clicensable activities\u201d: retail sale and supply of alcohol, provision of various forms \nof entertainment and provision of late night refreshment (i.e. hot food or hot drinks \nfrom 11.00 p.m. to 5.00 a.m.). The Act introduced a number of changes, \nimplementing a modernised and integrated scheme for the licensing of these activities, \nand, in the case of alcohol, moving responsibility for licensing from magistrates to \nlocal authorities. Applicants for premises licences (the main form of authorisation) \ndraw up an operating schedule indicating how they propose to carry out the licensable \nactivities and responsible authorities (e.g. police, trading standards and environmental \nhealth) and interested parties (e.g. members of the public living in the vicinity) can \nmake representations (objections) to the licensing authority. If any objections are \nreceived, the licensing authority must arrange for a hearing before a licensing sub-\n \n5 \ncommittee to determine the application but if no objections are received, the \napplication must be granted (see s 18(2)(3)). \n \nThe fieldwork for the project was undertaken in one licensing authority area, a semi-\nrural authority with a handful of towns. It was envisaged that data would be collected \non 30 applications from the year December 2005 to November 2006, with 10 from \neach of three \u2018classes\u2019 of case: where there were no objections; where objections were \nlodged, but no hearing took place;1 and where there was a hearing. Each class would \nbe randomly sampled from the year\u2019s applications but, in the event, data was collected \nonly for 27 applications, as only seven hearings took place in the year in question. A \nfile analysis was conducted on these cases and, utilising this data, semi-structured \ninterviews were conducted (both face to face and by telephone) with a range of \npersons involved in the decision-making process.2\n \n  For present purposes, telephone \ninterviews were conducted with local residents who objected to applications, both in \ncases where there was a hearing and where mediation removed the necessity for a \nhearing. \nAs the initial focus of the study was on the Act\u2019s operation rather than on how \nobjectors complained, the interviews were transcribed utilising orthographic \nconventions which did not capture phonological and other features of the utterances. \n                                                 \n1 This was largely because the objections were subject to negotiation and mediation. \n2 These included licensing officers, responsible authorities, sub-committee members, applicants, their \nlegal advisors and residents. An opportunity subsequently arose at a second authority, a medium-sized \nsuburban one, to conduct similar interviews with licensing officers, responsible authorities and sub-\ncommittee members but no other interviews or files analysis were undertaken here. \n \n6 \nThus the data is not presented in an ideal form for socio-linguistic analysis3\n \n but the \nthemes in the analysis below nevertheless offer insights into the act of complaining. \n3. Data Analysis \n \nThe data analysis undertaken was both inductive and deductive. The initial interest in \ncomplaining as a speech act emerged from the data, theoretical explanations for these \nfindings were then sought and then the relevant literature was subsequently re-\nexamined to check the results of this analysis. Data on complaining by objectors was \nobtained from three different sources: letters of objection; complaints by residents in \nhearings; and interviews with the researchers. 4\n \n Analysis was conducted on each \nsource in turn, as the literature review suggested that different contexts would \ninfluence the framing of objections. However, as the same complaint could be made \nin three different settings, analysis was also conducted to compare how each \ncomplaint was constructed in the differing contexts. \nThe transcripts were subjected to a close reading, with emerging themes identified in \nthe data.5\n                                                 \n3 Both researchers are additionally unversed in appropriate transcription conventions, being lawyers \nrather than linguists. \n The transcripts were then re-examined to build upon and check the insights \nthat were emerging. When necessary, the original audio recordings were accessed to \ncheck the impression given by the transcript. Once relevant themes were identified, \nexamples were compared with others to gain a picture of how residents objected. \n4  There were 37 letters of objection, although five were \u2018resubmissions\u2019 by residents who had \npreviously objected and wished to expand on the reasons for their objection, seven complaints in \nhearings and 10 residents interviewed. We were unable to interview all objectors due largely to \nresidents being non-contactable e.g. change of address. \n5  These themes were sometimes theoretically informed, and others emerged from reading the \ntranscripts. \n \n7 \n \n4. Performing the act of complaining: how to pitch a complaint \n \n(a) Cognitive Prominence and Social Agreement Principles \n \nWhen speakers wish to express disagreement, Yaeger-Dror, identifies a tension \nbetween what she describes as the \u201cCognitive Prominence Principle\u201d (CPP) and the \n\u201cSocial Agreement Principle\u201d (SAP) [24, p. 1333]. The CPP suggests that important \ninformation contained in any utterance should be clear and unambiguous; we should \nstate what we mean and make our complaints clear.6 The SAP, drawing on the work \nof Schegloff et al. [20], is based on a preference for agreement in informal \nconversations. 7 Within social interaction there is a preference to deliver expected \nresponses in turn; for instance, when asked a question we usually answer, when faced \nwith a greeting we reciprocate. Similarly, when subject to an invite, the preference is \nto accept, so that refusals are usually prefaced with apologies, delays and hedges (i.e. \ncaveats or qualifications). Thus, conversations are shaped by the expectations around \nhow we make appropriate statements and how we respond to the utterances of others. \nA complainer has, therefore, when complaining, to consider the appropriate balance \nbetween making oneself clear (CPP) and complying with expectations that we engage \nin \u2018socially agreeable\u2019 conversations (SAP). What is appropriate here depends upon a \nnumber of factors, such as role, setting and social distance between speakers; response \nof the other party; and social and conversational conventions.8\n \n \n(b) Preserving \u2018face\u2019 \n                                                 \n6 See also [8]. \n7 Also see [17]. \n8 See, for instance, [13 and 15]. \n \n8 \n \nIn understanding how we may pitch a complaint, and how this is influenced by the \nSAP, it is instructive to consider the work of Brown and Levinson on \u201cface\u201d [2].9\n  \n \nThey posit that speakers have face needs, both positive and negative, in any \ninteraction and these influence any interaction. Positive face concerns \u201cthe positive \nconsistent self-image or \u2018personality\u2019\u201d, while negative face consists of \u201cfreedom of \naction and freedom from imposition\u201d [2, p. 61]. So, when making a face threatening \nact (FTA), such as a complaint, face needs concern the projected self-image of the \ncomplainer (positive face) who also needs to take account of the face needs (negative \nface) of the recipient i.e. the desire not to be imposed upon. The recipient also has \npositive face needs and complainers need to be aware of how utterances may portray \nthe recipient. Finally, speakers also have negative face needs and should be aware that \ncertain speech acts, such as making offers, can impact upon their negative face. Given \nthe nature of complaining as a specific FTA, with a particular impact upon the \npositive face of the complainer, Edwards emphasises the importance of \u201cthe \nsubjective side of complaining\u201d [4, p. 5.] i.e. that complainants will make an effort to \nappear reasonable and objective to avoid the label \u2018whinger\u2019. \nBrown and Levinson address in detail the different \u201cstrategies\u201d 10\n                                                 \n9 See also [6 and 7]. \n that speakers \nemploy when making FTAs. These include going \u2018on record\u2019, going \u2018off record\u2019, and \nutilising \u2018positive politeness\u2019 or \u2018negative politeness\u2019. Going \u2018on record\u2019 is the making \nof an unambiguous statement and is an example of Yaeger-Dror\u2019s CPP; \u2018on record\u2019 \nFTAs are unambiguous acts where the intentions of the speaker are clear. Going \u2018off \nrecord\u2019 is the making of an ambiguous statement, thereby allowing the recipient to \n10  Brown and Levinson describe these as \u201cstrategies\u201d whilst acknowledging that they may not \nnecessarily be conscious choices. \n \n9 \navoid the FTA by interpreting it in a non-threatening manner. An example given by \nBrown and Levinson is \u201c[d]amn, I\u2019m out of cash, I forgot to go to the bank today\u201d [2, \np. 69]. This can be interpreted as a FTA, a request for a loan, but the recipient could \ninterpret this as a pure statement of fact and ignore the request. Brown and Levinson \nposit that the more a FTA is regarded as threatening, the more likely the ambiguous \nnature of the FTA. \u2018Off record\u2019 strategies are concerned with the face needs of the \nspeakers and are an example of the SAP overriding the CPP. Positive politeness is \n\u201corientated towards the positive face of [the hearer], the positive self-image that he \nclaims for himself\u201d [2, p. 70] and, in utilising positive politeness, speakers emphasise \nshared needs, interests and values. Speakers minimise FTAs by manufacturing \nsolidarity; FTAs are less threatening when performed between equals. Negative \npoliteness, on the other hand, \u201cis orientated mainly toward partially satisfying \n(redressing) [the hearer\u2019s] negative face\u201d [2, p. 70] through strategies such as \nformality, restraint, hedges and apologies. \n \nBrown and Levinson claim that there exists a hierarchy of strategies that may be \nadopted and uptake is influenced by a number of variables i.e. \u201csocial distance\u201d, \n\u201crelative power\u201d, \u201cthe absolute ranking of impositions in a particular culture\u201d, \n\u201cliking\u201d and \u201cformality\u201d [2, p. 16 and 74]. As intimates perform FTAs differently \nfrom strangers, so students, for example, will adopt FTA strategies depending upon \nwhether they are interacting with lecturers or fellow students and different FTAs are \nregarded as more burdensome that others in particular cultures.11\n \n \n                                                 \n11 House and Kasper similarly describe techniques that speakers can adopt as \u2018politeness markers\u2019, such \nas hedging, understating, down-toning, hesitating or forewarning [11]. \n \n10 \nThese insights provide useful tools for thinking about how legal complaints can be \nmade and the strategies that may be adopted. Strategies are influenced by factors such \nas social distance and relative power. Although complainers may or may not possess a \nhigh degree of social capital, there is inevitably an asymmetry of power because \nprofessionals in the legal process have specialised knowledge. Similarly, FTAs that \nclients take to legal processes are onerous as legal complaints impact upon the \nnegative face of the recipient because they are a request for action. These factors \nsuggest that complainers coming to the law, if Brown and Levinson\u2019s analysis is \ncorrect, are more likely to perform FTAs in manner that minimises their threat \nthrough use of politeness strategies. \n \n(c) Legal complaints as \u2018indirect complaints\u2019 \n \nComplainers coming to legal processes may well not be making a direct complaint i.e. \na complaint to a person whose conduct forms the basis for the complaint. Rather they \nmay be making an indirect complaint i.e. a complaint to a third person about another\u2019s \nconduct. It is instructive therefore to consider the work of Boxer on indirect \ncomplaints and its inter-relationship with social distance [1]. Boxer considers indirect \ncomplaints not to be FTAs in the same mould as direct complaints in that \u201cthey are \noften employed in an attempt to establish rapport or solidarity\u201d [1, p. 106]. Thus, for \nexample, complaints by neighbours about other neighbours, when engaging in \nneighbourly gossip, may be undertaken to reinforce social bonds. Boxer posits that the \ngreater the social distance, the more hesitant we are with indirect complaints; we are \nhesitant with strangers to maximise positive face, less hesitant with friends and more \n \n11 \ndirect with intimates.12\n \n In short, we do not want to appear as \u2018whingers\u2019 \u2013 a concern \nwith positive face \u2013 and we are therefore more likely to be guarded, all things being \nequal, as social distance increases. \n(d) Institutional expectations \n \nAn important aspect of the interaction we are examining is the institutional setting in \nwhich interaction takes place. Edwards, commenting on neighbourhood mediation, \nsuggests that complaints have \u201cto be made severe enough to be worth resorting to that \nkind of setting, requiring those kinds of resources\u201d [4, p. 25]. So, for legal settings, \ncomplaints have to satisfy an institutional threshold; they have to be sufficiently \nserious to justify the intervention of legal machinery. Complainants are therefore \nfaced with a tension; face needs suggest that complaints will be made tentatively \nwhile institutional requirements place a threshold on what is regarded as sufficiently \nserious. This takes us back to Yaeger-Dror and her conflict between the CPP and the \nSAP (see (a) above). Does one engage in politeness at the expense of furthering one\u2019s \nclaim? \n \n(e) Complaints as interaction \n \nSo far, we have considered strategies that a complainer may adopt when presenting a \ncomplaint, having regard to face needs and institutional expectations, but social \ninteraction is an on-going and dynamic process. Thus, in the course of a particular \ninteraction, as speakers become aware of the reaction of the recipient and how the \n                                                 \n12 Boxer regards indirect complaints as an exception to Wolfson\u2019s theory of social distance known as \n\u2018The Bulge\u2019 [23]. Under this theory, solidarity building talk is considered more prevalent between \nfriends and acquaintances when compared to either intimates or strangers. \n \n12 \nrecipient responds (both verbally and non-verbally), parties may adjust their position \naccordingly e.g. where a complaint is received less than enthusiastically, a complainer \nmay downgrade the complaint.13\n \n We could also expect, conversely, that a receptive \nrecipient may well lead a complainer to emphasise the nature and impact of the \ncomplaint. In short, facework is a dynamic and ongoing process to which speakers \nhave regard throughout the course of an interaction. All this suggests that the nature \nof complaining is not a straightforward process of simply presenting the facts, but is \nrather an elaborate interactional process between parties with different face needs. \n(f) Working up complaints \n \nA final factor that may affect the presentation of complaints is choice of tactics used \nby complainants to work up their complaints. This, as Edwards points out, can be \ndone through \u201cobjectification\u201d [4, p. 6], the presentation of the complaint as objective \nfact as opposed to subjective experience. This is achieved through a variety of means \nincluding: \n\u2022 \u201cscript formulation\u201d, where \u201cevents are offered as instances of generalised \nrecurrent patterns\u201d [4, p. 6] \n\u2022 \u201cextreme case formulations\u201d (ECFs) [18]  \n\u2022 the offering of corroboration by others, such as expressing concern about how \nothers have been affected \n\u2022 utilisation of \u201cverbatim quotes\u201d [4, p. 6] \n\u2022 employment of \u201cgraphic narrative descriptions\u201d [4, p. 6] and  \n\u2022 engagement of the recipient in a \u201cjoint production\u201d of the complaint [4, p. 6].  \n                                                 \n13See Edwards\u2019 example of a schoolteacher\u2019s complaint about lack of books [4, p. 10]. See also [3, 5 \nand 12]. \n \n13 \n \nSimilarly, Potter describes a number of means by which descriptions are \u201cworked up\u201d \nto make general claims [19, p. 108]. These include: \n\u2022 stake inoculations (denying that the speaker has a stake in the description) \n\u2022 category entitlements (the claim that a speaker is well placed to make the \ncomment) \n\u2022 consensus and corroboration (what we later describe as co-opting others), \nparticularly through \u2018active voicing\u2019 (using the quotes of others) and  \n\u2022 \u201cextrematisation\u201d [19, p. 187] (e.g. ECFs). \n \n5. Performing the act of complaining in licensing cases \n \nThe data from the letters, hearings and interviews displays a distinct pattern of how \nobjectors go about the act of complaining. In many respects, the data we are about to \nexamine shares a number of features that were identified in the earlier literature \nreview. When complaining, actors adopt a number of strategies 14\n                                                 \n14 Following Brown and Levinson (see n 10 above) we adopt the term \u201cstrategy\u201d while recognising that \nthis may not necessarily be a conscious choice of actors. \n in formulating \ncomplaints. First, particularly in the letters, but also elsewhere in the data, residents \nwill make a claim to standing. Secondly, we also see a number of examples of \npoliteness being used in the furtherance of complaints. Thirdly, to objectify \ncomplaints, residents may utilise various approaches, including co-opting others; \nadopting script formulations; expressing opinion as fact; and using verbatim quotes. \nFourthly, complainants seek to make out their case as special and deserving of \nattention. Fifthly, they adopt ECFs and intensifiers. Each of these strategies will be \nanalysed in turn. \n \n14 \n \n(a) Standing \n \nA number of objectors begin complaints, whether in letters, hearings or interviews, \nwith a claim to standing. This to some extent reflects the licensing regime\u2019s \nrequirement that, for \u2018interested parties\u2019 to make representations under s 13(4)(a) of \nthe 2003 Act, they have to live \u2018in the vicinity\u2019 of the applicant\u2019s premises. \nObjections, therefore, frequently address this point. To quote from one of the letters: \n \nAlthough our address is [\u2026] our cottage is situated in [a road] and, along with \n[two other properties], is the closest proximity to [the premises]. We have no \nback garden and are approximately 50 yards from the performance area\u2026 \n \nWe can see here, however, that claims to standing are not only limited to establishing \nthat the resident lives in the vicinity but also an intensifier is used (the resident lives in \n\u201cclosest proximity to [the premises]\u201d). The intensifier alerts the recipient of the letter \nto the fact that this is more than merely a claim to be heard; being immediately behind \nthe venue gives the complainer special cause to complain due to the \u2018extreme\u2019 \nproximity and the lack of a back garden further reinforces the closeness of their \nresidence to the venue. There is, therefore, a claim of category entitlement [19]. \n \n(b) Politeness in the furtherance of complaints \n \nThe use of one politeness strategy, attending to positive face through denial of a \ncomplaint, is a consistent feature of the data. In the extracts below, taken from an \n \n15 \ninterview with a local resident, we can see how the resident aims to create a positive \nself image; one does not object or complain, rather one makes reasonable requests and \ncomments. Such claims were made throughout the interview, from the first statement \nonwards. Rather than produce the whole text, a number of illustrative extracts are \nprovided where the resident attends to positive face through the claim of \u2018common \nsense\u2019 and reasonable standards of behaviour: \n \nIt wasn\u2019t an outright objection but we wanted some common sense with the \nhours for the licence\u2026 \n\u2026 So what we wanted to do was say we don\u2019t mind, we just want a reasonable \nlimit on amplified events and for people to be sensible when it comes to noise \nlevels. \n \nA similar technique was adopted by others who denied that they were complaining \nand being unreasonable. What follows is an extract from a letter of objection: \n \nIt is not my intention to be a killjoy. However, I do believe that my family has \na right to live peacefully in our home without an unreasonable level of \ndisturbance. \n \nWe can see here the claim that the resident does not want to stop others having fun; \nindeed, the implication is that a reasonable level of disturbance is acceptable. \nHowever, the activities proposed are seen as going beyond this, as unreasonable \nproposals, and therefore needing to be challenged.  \n \n \n16 \nWhile the residents above attend to positive face through the adoption of strategies \nthat are concerned with self, we can see that this strategy also questions the \nreasonableness or sincerity of applicants. Given that such attacks on applicants are \nserious FTAs, especially in hearings when applicants are present, this is done \u2018off \nrecord\u2019. In the extracts above we can see how the resident attempts to question \nwhether the applicant is reasonable or sensible e.g. the resident comments that \u201cwe \njust want \u2026 for people to be sensible when it comes to noise levels\u201d. This is \u2018off \nrecord\u2019 as the resident does not point directly to the applicant, and it could be read as \nasking for the licensing authority to be \u201csensible\u201d. However, given the reference to \nearlier problems and the manner in which these were presented, we can reasonably \nassume that this is a reference addressed to the applicant. In going \u2018off record\u2019, the \nresident is adopting a politeness strategy. Rather than aggressively questioning the \napplicant the complaint is modified so it is purely about what is reasonable. The \nadoption of a politeness strategy that emphasises the positive face of the complainer \nworks on two levels; it paints a picture of the complainer as reasonable and operates \nas an \u2018off record\u2019 criticism of the applicant. We can see, therefore, that adoption of \npoliteness strategies can also reinforce a complaint.  \n \nHowever, when politeness fails, complainers may choose to be more direct. In the \nfollowing extract, we can see how an \u2018off record\u2019 criticism of the applicant is \nreinforced when the criticism is not accepted by the applicant. This took place within \na hearing when the applicant was questioned by the resident on the failure of an \nearlier mediation process: \n \n \n17 \nResident: Is it true though that the onus is always on us to complain, therefore \nthe noise has happened before we can get anybody out? \nApplicant: It is not in my interest to receive any complaints. I don\u2019t want \nanybody to have to complain. I don\u2019t ever want it to get to that stage and in \nfour years there\u2019s been one concert that there was a problem with noise. It was \na local [\u2026] band who we all know called [\u2026] and they are quite a noisy band \nand on that particular day they [had] a very lively active audience and they \nwere responding to their audience. I wasn\u2019t there on that day but one of my \nofficers was. \nResident: The fact is that other bands, are they going to be controlled or not, \nincluding [the band named above]? \nApplicant: I believe other bands have always been controlled and the future \nwould be no different. Some bands use amplification, some don\u2019t; we try to \nhave a varied programme. \nResident: But why are we here if that is the case? \nApplicant: I don\u2019t know the answer to that. \n \nThe resident is implying that noise is a feature of the events organised and the onus is \non him to complain. While the applicant portays the problem as being minor and \nrestricted to one band, with the possible implication that the residents are \nunreasonable (\u201cthey [had] a very lively active audience and they were responding to \ntheir audience\u201d), the resident goes \u2018off record\u2019 to criticise this proposition by asking \nwhether other bands are \u201cgoing to be controlled or not\u201d. When the implicit criticism is \nrejected (\u201cother bands have always been controlled\u201d) the resident sarcastically asks \nwhy there is a need for a hearing. The criticism that the applicant does not control the \n \n18 \nactivities of the bands is therefore made explicit. The applicant\u2019s final statement is, in \nsome senses, a withdrawal from the interaction in the face of the FTA from the \nresident, but it could also be thought of as an \u2018off record\u2019 criticism of the residents \nalong the lines of \u2018I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here when there doesn\u2019t appear to be a \nproblem and others seem to enjoy the programme of events\u2019. In any event, the \napplicant clearly responds to the criticism that is directed at her. \n \n (c) Objectifying complaints \n \n(i) Co-opting others \n \nA first method by which residents attempt to objectify their complaints is through the \nco-opting of others. In doing so, the resident is either making the claim that others \nagree or, in some cases, that the application will impact disproportionately on \nvulnerable persons. This can be done with varying degrees of sophistication. The \nsimplest method is to either name specific persons or classes of persons affected: \n \nMusic was the worst of all. [It] was that bad it vibrated the floor boards and \nshook the houses. This had made my two children cry and scared, especially \nmy son. He thought it was an earthquake\u2026 \nMy children have definitely put up with enough loud noise to last them a \nlifetime. \n \nA very common method of co-opting others, and more implicit, is to refer to residents \nin the plural: \n \n19 \n \nDetail[ed] consideration has not been given to effects upon residents \nimmediately adjacent to the site and to a lesser degree to surrounding \nareas\u202615\n \n \nThis tactic co-opts unknown others into the complaint and, in so doing, objectors are \nclaiming to speak for others who share their concerns. Perhaps the most implicit \nmethod of co-opting others is through the use of the plural pronoun; rather than the \ncomplainer referring to \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d, we see instead references to \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d \nand \u201cour\u201d. The text below is a good example of this strategy, of which there are a \nlarge number of examples in the data: \n \nWhat I recall of it [mediation], we all sat, we had to go to the council office\u2026 \nand we all sat around a table and she [the applicant] wouldn\u2019t budge basically, \nshe wouldn\u2019t alter her application at all\u2026 \nShe didn\u2019t listen to our concerns in any way\u2026 \n\u2026our concern was she may move from her job and someone else may have a \ndifferent opinion\u2026 \nYes, we had to go to the council [for the hearing process], like a courtroom I \nsuppose\u2026 \n\u2026we were treated very courteously. We didn\u2019t have to wait very long. \nAnd we were all given our time, five minutes to speak and got our points \nover\u2026 \n                                                 \n15 Emphasis in original letter. Throughout the presentation of the data, any emphasis in the text can be \npresumed to be added for the purposes of illustration, unless, as here, otherwise indicated. \n \n20 \nAnd we had a fair hearing we thought. And then I think \u2026 we had the \nopportunity to ask the [licensing] officer\u2026 why she [the applicant] wasn\u2019t \nprepared to talk to us\u2026 \nIt was pretty well what I was expecting, but I am a magistrate so I\u2019m used to, I \nknew what to expect\u2026 \nIt might have been a little bit daunting, I guess, for anybody that was not used \nto that kind of scenario \u2026 but not for us at the time. \n \nWe can see throughout the extracts above a constant reference to a shared experience: \n\u201cwe all sat\u201d; \u201cShe didn\u2019t listen to our concerns\u201d; \u201cour concern\u201d; \u201cwe had to go to the \ncouncil\u201d; \u201cwe were treated very courteously\u201d; \u201cwe had a fair hearing\u201d. In the \ninterview above (and in others) we do see times when the respondent switches from \n\u201cwe\u201d to \u201cI\u201d, but this is largely done when using hedges (\u201cI think\u201d, \u201cI suppose\u201d) or \nwhen referring to experiences that are necessarily singular, such as the comment that \n\u201cI am a magistrate\u201d. Even this last claim to experience was switched in the next \nsentence to claim that the experience was not daunting \u201cfor us at the time\u201d. Adoption \nof the plural pronoun can be seen as a subtle strategy utilised to co-opt others in the \ncomplaint to speak on behalf of others and objectify the complaint. If a complainer is \nnot the only one complaining, they implicitly claim that they cannot be unreasonable \nas others share their views. Furthermore, the numbers relied upon and the extent to \nwhich others actually support the complainer\u2019s view remains unstated.16\n \n \n(ii) Script formulations \n \n                                                 \n16 See [19, p. 161-162]. \n \n21 \nA second method by which residents attempt to objectify their complaints is through \nscript formulation and we see instances of this in the data, with residents making \nreference to well known examples of social problems and comparing the complaint to \nthem. So, residents could call on imagery of large scale entertainment events with \nwhich disorder might be associated: \n \nThere will be allowed, unless the application is modified, the type of \nperformances that actively encourages public disorder. One only has to recall \nsome of the rock concerts around the country to visualise what could occur\u2026 \n \nWe see a similar, although more implicit, claim in one of our interviews: \u201cWell, I \nthink we all thought we were going to have a Glastonbury type thing\u201d. These are \nimages with which many are familiar and their adoption gives the audience a schema \ninto which the grounds of the complaint can be \u2018slotted\u2019. In making use of pre-\nexisting scripts the complaint is reinforced through juxtaposition of the application \nand the problems associated with large scale events. As a result, many may empathise \nwith the position of the residents and understand their objections. \n \n(iii) Expressing opinion as fact \n \nA third method by which residents attempt to objectify their complaints is to upgrade \nopinion to fact, as in the following two instances from the data: \n \n\u2026 the noise on one event was so tremendous, it came through my double \nglazing and everybody else\u2019s. It must have done. \n \n22 \n \n... I know there will be issues of noise \u2026 I know there will be problems. \n \nReference here to \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d indicate established fact rather than assertion of \nopinion, thereby reinforcing the complaint. \n \n(iv) Using verbatim quotes  \n \nA fourth method by which residents attempt to objectify their complaints is the use of \nverbatim quotes of others, described by Potter as \u201cactive voicing\u201d [19, p. 161-162]. In \nthe interview extract below the respondent calls on the support of environmental \nhealth to substantiate the complaint: \n \nI complained about it and they give me information about environmental \nhealth ... the man ... taped it, and he couldn\u2019t believe it himself, why I was \nliving there. Because he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe how you put up with it.\u201d \n \nAll these four methods above, using a variety of techniques, are aimed at objectifying \nthe complaint and asking us to see it as a real problem for residents.  \n \n(d) Making out a special case \n \nAs indicated (see 5 (a) above), when residents claim standing they will refer to the \nproximity of their residence to the applicant\u2019s premises and thereby seek to establish \nthat their case was special. Additionally, residents utilised other strategies to claim \n \n23 \nthat their case was worthy of extra consideration e.g. that, due to personal \ncircumstances, noise had particular impact on the household: \n \nMy two children had enough of it when we lived in the former matrimonial \nhome. Their dad used to come back drunk and smash everything. We had to \nleave our home there, to escape domestic violence from my ex-husband \u2026 My \nchildren have definitely put up with enough loud noise to last them a lifetime \nwithout any more. \n \nIn this claim, we see how objectors are attempting to create a difference between their \ncase and others. As a strategy, it reinforces their position as valid complainers and it is \na means thereby to attend to positive face. Implicit in these claims is a call that their \ncomplaint is justified due to their status, in this case the vulnerability of the objector\u2019s \nchildren, and they are not to be seen as \u2018whingers\u2019. \n \n(e) ECFs and intensifiers \n \nThe adoption of ECFs can be seen throughout the data sample. Their use reinforces \nthe impact of the proposed application upon the objector. ECFs portray the complaint \nin an extreme manner and are thereby employed as strategies to emphasize the impact \non the objector. For instance, one respondent in interview commented on the failure \nof mediation being due to the applicant\u2019s intransigence: \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t alter her \napplication at all\u201d; \u201cshe didn\u2019t listen to our concerns in any way\u201d; \u201cshe wasn\u2019t \nprepared to talk\u201d. Of course, as a mediation meeting did take place, the applicant was \nprepared to (and did) talk, listened, but did not agree with the residents\u2019 concerns and \n \n24 \nthought them unreasonable. A further example was that a neighbour \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear \nthe television\u2026 the neighbour went out because he couldn\u2019t do anything\u201d. \n \nThe utilisation of intensifiers performs a similar role to ECFs. In the words of \nresidents from the sample, odours are \u201cfoul\u201d, music is \u201cvery loud\u201d and is \u201cblasted over \nthe area\u201d. Again, the objective here is to reinforce the impact of the complaint. \n \n(f) Constructing an effective complaint \n \nAll the strategies considered in (a)-(e) above are concerned with effectively \npersuading some other person of the authenticity and strength of the complaint. This \nanalysis can also be extended to the work on attending to positive face explored above \n(see 5 (b)); while there are many politeness strategies at play here, as described by \nBrown and Levinson, we can see how in many respects the face work performed also \nserves the ulterior goal of complaining. If the resident is reasonable, not really \ncomplaining, and understands that people must have their fun, then the complaint is \nalso reasonable, it attends to the interests of others and is concerned with balance and \n\u2018sensible\u2019 solutions. In this context, only an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 audience could reject the \ncomplaint as groundless or a simple act of \u2018whinging\u2019. We can see, therefore, in this \npart of the data how the institutional expectations of the setting establish the \nboundaries for framing the complaint. Nevertheless, in contrast to this aspect of the \ndata, we also see the adoption of a number of politeness strategies and it is to these \nthat we now turn. \n \n6. The adoption of politeness strategies \n \n25 \n \nOur analysis above of the data suggests that effective communication and the \nconstruction of a persuasive case is the prime consideration of most objectors. \nNevertheless, we do see in the data, although to a lesser extent, examples of the \nadoption of politeness strategies when complaining. We see objectors attending to \npositive face; making complaints \u2018off record\u2019; utilising hedges and other politeness \nmarkers; expressing facts as opinions; engaging in joint production of (sections of) \ntalk; and directly attending to the face needs of applicants. The outcome of such \nstrategies, each of which is considered below, is that effectiveness is reduced when \nattending to the positive and negative face needs of all participants. \n \n(a) Attending to positive face \n \nWe explored above how objectors would in all three settings attend to positive face \nthrough portrayal of themselves as reasonable and sensible citizens with limited \ncomplaints. As we claim in the conclusion to the previous section on constructing \ncomplaints (see 5 (f) above), such strategies can be seen as an effective means of \nmaking a complaint; in characterising their actions as reasonable, especially if in so \ndoing the complainer makes an \u2018off record\u2019 criticism of the applicant. Nevertheless, \nthis strategy is also a means by which the objector attends to positive face to divert the \npotential criticism of being a whinger or a serial complainer who is not to be taken \nseriously. \n \n(b) Going \u2018off record\u2019 \n \n \n26 \nSimilarly, when exploring how objectors attend to positive face (see 5 (b) above), we \npresented data above that demonstrates how objectors may create a juxtaposition of \nthemselves as reasonable and the applicant as unreasonable and\/or obstructive. This \ncan be combined with going \u2018off record\u2019, as in the example below: \n \nTwo or three years ago, when the [venue] was first envisaged, the [applicant] \ndiscussed it at their well-attended open meeting. There were a number of\u2026 \nresidents in attendance, all concerned at what this would mean. At that time, I \nraised the point that so long as organisers were sensible over the number of \nevents and controlled the noise level, there should not be an issue. This point \nof view seemed to be accepted at the time. \n \nWe can see in this extract how the objector attends to his positive face needs. He \npoints out that he raised an issue and he was merely asking for others to be sensible. \nIn the last sentence the applicant co-opts others, including the applicant, in his \nassessment of this request as being reasonable as it was \u201caccepted at the time\u201d. \nHowever, this is more than simply the co-option of others; it is an \u2018off record\u2019 \ncriticism of the applicant in that he has reneged on the \u2018sensible agreement\u2019 \npreviously made. The claim here is a strong one; the objector is questioning the \nsincerity and honesty of the applicant and, given the nature of this as a FTA, an \u2018off \nrecord\u2019 strategy is adopted. Here effectiveness is compromised to attend to face needs. \n \n(c) Hedges and other politeness markers \n \n \n27 \nHedges and other politeness markers perform an important task in the preservation of \nface; they can be adopted to \u2018distance\u2019 the complainer from the substance of the \ncomplaint and suggest hesitation in making the complaint. As a socio-linguistic \nanalysis was not envisaged when undertaking the study, interviews and hearings were \nnaturally transcribed utilising a conventional orthographic technique and \u2018ums\u2019, \ndelays and other hedges were therefore not included in the transcriptions. Despite this, \nwe can make a tentative claim that there is limited uptake of hedges and other \npoliteness markers. In the interviews, for example, objectors utilise hedges largely \nwhen commenting on the process of objecting, rather than on the grounds of the \ncomplaint. So, in the text below the respondent is asked if he attended a mediation \nmeeting and, if so, his experiences of it: \n \nI think the informal meeting we had, I think the [applicant], didn\u2019t think it was \na problem at all. I think the other people, the licensing officers, did. \n \nOn process, the objector is very tentative, hedging his views with the marker \u201cI \nthink\u201d. However, when expressing the substance of his complaint there were few \npoliteness markers.17\n \n \n (d) Expressing facts as opinions \n \nIn the extract on hedges above, we see the respondent hedging comments on the \nprocess with \u201cI think\u201d. As well as being a hedge, this is a method whereby the \nrespondent downgrades a factual claim to one of opinion or experience. While this \n                                                 \n17 Shortage of space prevents inclusion of details but in the case, as in most of the extracts reproduced \nin this article, there were few politeness markers. \n \n28 \nwas a feature of the data in the study, it was one that was not adopted as much as \nmight have been expected when the data analysis was begun. This paucity in the data \nsuggests overall that effectiveness takes priority over politeness. \n \n(e) Joint productions \n \nWithin the hearings there are examples of joint production of talk, whereby the parties \ncollectively interact, e.g. through overlaps18\n \n and the completion of others\u2019 statements. \nSuch interactions, which build solidarity, include others in the production of talk and \nso we can regard them as being concerned with the positive face of the other in the \nencounter. The extract below is an example of joint production, where the applicant \nand an objector are establishing how the applicant controls those who provide \nentertainment events in the public space and are exploring whether the applicant has a \nsystem in place to ensure that those who fail to clean the space after the event will \nlose a booking deposit: \nObjector: And the [applicant or] someone from [your organisation] will go \ndown there and check before they get their deposit back? \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. \nObjector: So, what has happened in the past that there has been a problem \nthen? \nApplicant: But then if that had been the case, we\u2019ll have kept the deposit and \nthen the [organisation] would have cleaned the site up\u2026 \nObjector: And stop them from doing this again. \n                                                 \n18 These can be competitive or supportive depending upon whether the overlap reiterates the previous \nstatement or is an attempt to gain control of the interaction. \n \n29 \n \nWe can see here how the objector finishes the statement for the applicant; not only \nwill leaving the venue in an unsatisfactory state result in a loss of the deposit, but the \norganisers will not be allowed to use the space in future. This is damaging to the \nobjector\u2019s case as it creates an image of an applicant with systems in place to uncover \nproblems and employ effective sanctions in the event that these are found. The \nobjector jointly constructs this case by finishing the sentence of the applicant in a \ncollaborative manner. We see here positive politeness and the inclusion of the \napplicant in a joint endeavour trumping the effective making of a claim. \n \n(f) Attending to the face needs of applicants \n \nWithin hearings we see another feature of politeness strategies rarely seen elsewhere \ndue to the context, which is direct complaining, when objectors can put questions to \nthe applicant, rather than indirect complaining, where objectors complain to the \nlicensing authority. This can increase the likelihood of the uptake of politeness \nstrategies as objectors have to aim their FTA direct to the applicant. Earlier, when \nexploring \u2018off record\u2019 strategies of complainants, we provided an example of how the \nresident switched from an \u2018off record\u2019 to an \u2018on record\u2019 complaint when the implicit \ncomplaint was rejected (see 5 (b) above). Elsewhere we see objectors also attending to \nthe face needs of the applicant, as when one resident asks a question in a polite \nmanner:  \n \n \n30 \nOne thing does worry me, Mary,19\n \n may I ask you? Will you please make sure \nor can you make sure as a performance is going on, would you give a \nguarantee that your staff will walk round and listen to the volume? \nThe resident addresses the applicant by her first name, and requests an audience \n(\u201cmay I ask you?\u201d). There is a concern with the negative face needs of the applicant \nhere; asking a question is a burden imposed, so is performed politely and inclusively \nby the utilisation of a forename rather than a more formal address. Similarly, \u201c[w]ill \nyou please\u201d, a direct request, is repaired and \u2018softened\u2019 to \u201ccan you make sure\u201d, \nintimating that this (perhaps) should only take place if within the applicant\u2019s power. \nHowever, this is upgraded to a request to give a guarantee that effective procedures \nwill be implemented. Later, the objector states that \u201cI\u2019m afraid I insist that something \nis done\u201d. While a forceful request is eventually made, this is qualified with the use of \nnumerous politeness markers. In short, when faced with the applicant in the hearing, \nwe see the objector attending to the face needs of the applicant in a manner that is \nrarely repeated elsewhere. \n \n(g) Conclusion \n \nOverall, it appears that effectiveness takes priority over the adoption of politeness. \nAlthough objectors attend to the face needs of others and themselves, this is a limited \nfeature of the data. Indeed, when attending to their own positive face needs, this could \nbe explained as a strategy adopted by objectors to enhance the complaint. While we \nsaw the use of hedges, politeness markers, attending to the face needs of applicants \n                                                 \n19 To preserve anonymity, the applicant\u2019s real name has not been used. \n \n31 \nand some joint production of talk, these features in the data were less marked than the \nstrategies adopted to make an effective complaint and, in the case of attending to the \nface needs of applicants, could be explained as a result of the applicant being present \nat the hearing with the objector. \n \n7. Interaction and complaints \n \nIn this section we want to explore a feature of the data that was anticipated in the \nliterature review; the importance of the dynamics of the interaction for the \ndevelopment of the complaint (see 4 (e) above). It was posited there that complaints \ncould be effectively \u2018upgraded\u2019 or \u2018downgraded\u2019 depending on how the recipient \nresponds. There are features in the data that support the importance of recipient \nresponse in the framing of complaints. We have already explored how objectors may \nengage in co-operative behaviour in constructing the interaction to render less \neffective the claims that they are making e.g. by effectively endorsing an applicant\u2019s \nclaim that procedures were in place to deal with problems as they arise (see 6 (e) \nabove). The setting of the hearing, therefore, where applicants and objectors may \nengage in an interaction, can result in politeness being prioritised over effectiveness. \nOf course, as we also saw in the switching of an \u2018off record\u2019 complaint to one \u2018on \nrecord\u2019, objectors can equally engage in competitive \u2018points scoring\u2019 to build a case \n(see 5 (b) above). \n \nWithin the interviews we can see a different dynamic at work. The primary purpose of \nthe interviews was to elicit opinions on the licensing process, with questions focused \non how the procedure operated in practice and on how applicants, residents and others \n \n32 \nperceive the process. As a result, the two interviewers aimed at establishing rapport \nand allowing respondents the space to elaborate on their answers. Nevertheless, \nobjectors would still manage to express the substance of their complaints, frequently \neven when not prompted to do so. The effect of this focus was that interviewers rarely \nchallenged objectors on the substance of their complaints. We can see in the interview \ndata, therefore, a number of examples of supportive utterances from the interviewer \nbeing followed by a restatement of the problem from the objector. In the extract \nbelow the interviewer makes a number of supportive statements throughout the text \nand these co-operative utterances were taken as opportunities to repeat or upgrade the \ncomplaint. \n \nObjector: I weren\u2019t [sic] happy with it because they was [sic] doing it on days \nwhen the kids had to go to school the day after, you see, and it\u2019s affecting \nthem. So I had to get like a child psychologist involved and everybody. \nInterviewer: Oh, goodness. \nObjector: Yeah it was that bad, it was affecting especially my lad. It was \naffecting his sleep, he couldn\u2019t go to bed early to get up to go to school. He \nwas always going to school tired. I had a letter from the school saying he\u2019s \nalways tired at school, so I had that as well. Yeah, it was affecting him a lot so \nin the end I just gave up and just moved out myself because they weren\u2019t \nhelping... \n \nObjector: ...Well I couldn\u2019t really speak to the pub owners because they had \nthe attitude of they didn\u2019t want to know what I thought and, since they had a \nfire there, that was it. That put my kid\u2019s lives in danger. \n \n33 \nInterviewer: They had a fire there? \nObjector: That really put it to you for six that did, because we had to get out \nquick because [of] the smoke, the fumes of the fire. \n \nInterviewer: So in essence, to put it bluntly you were really unhappy with \nwhat happened and so unhappy you actually moved out. \nObjector: I was very unhappy \u2026 I don\u2019t think anybody sensible would put up \nwith it. \nInterviewer: That sounds really bad. \nObjector: It was very bad. It drove me to depression basically, so I had to get \nout. \n \nAfter initially describing the problem as serious, the respondent elaborates further \nwhen supported by the exclamation of the interviewer (\u201cgoodness\u201d); further details of \nthe problems at the school and with the children sleeping are provided with the use of \nintensifiers and ECFs (\u201che\u2019s always tired\u201d). Similarly, the restatement of the fire \nproblem by the interviewer elicited further comment on the details and the danger \ncreated. In the final exchange we see the interviewer drawing the interview to a close \nby summarising how the resident felt about the process. Being supportive, this gave \nthe resident further opportunity to describe the impact of the problems. Her final \ncomment concerned the impact upon her health: \u201cit drove me to depression basically, \nso I had to get out\u201d. Importantly, in her letter to the licensing authority the resident \nmade no reference to her position or to the fire at the premises, framing her objections \non how problems impacted on her children. Since these further details were revealed \n \n34 \nonly during an interview where the interviewer was supportive, this perhaps indicates \nthat it was the support that led to further disclosure. \n \n8. The importance of context and setting \n \nSo far, we have suggested that, when making complaints on applications, residents \nlargely adopt strategies that prioritise effectiveness over politeness. However, we have \nsuggested at appropriate points in the analysis that the framing of complaints is \ninfluenced by context. Subtle differences can be found in the data that suggest claims \nare moderated depending upon the context and setting in which they are made. First, \noral complaints (e.g. objections in interviews and hearings) appear to be constructed \ndifferently from written complaints (e.g. letters), with a greater emphasis on \npoliteness. Secondly, there is tentative evidence to suggest that women complain \ndifferently from men, again with greater emphasis on politeness. Each of these is \nexamined below. \n \n(a) Oral and written complaints  \n \n(i) Oral complaints \n \nAs interaction within the interview was a (largely) supportive environment leading \nobjectors to reinforce and upgrade their complaints (see 7 above), we can see the \nimportance of the recipient of a complaint to how it will be developed. The \n\u2018complaint\u2019 does not arrive \u2018fully formed\u2019, but is instead constructed by the actors \nwithin the particular setting in which they find themselves and this setting influences \n \n35 \nthe shape and content of the interaction. Similarly, politeness needs within hearings \ncan lead to joint construction of utterances alongside attending to the face needs of \napplicants by objectors (see 6 (e) and (f) above). What is important here is the \npresence of the applicant and the direct confrontation through questioning him. Again, \nthe setting influences the production of the complaint with greater use of politeness \nmarkers, although their use was still somewhat rare and objectors in hearings largely \nfocused on the effectiveness of the complaint. The presence of the applicant, perhaps \nnot surprisingly, leads to a greater emphasis upon politeness notwithstanding that the \nobjector needs to emphasise the complaint at the hearing since this is the setting in \nwhich a final decision will be made. \n \n(ii) Written complaints \n \nIn written complaints (primarily letters), there was an absence of politeness markers, \nsuch as joint production of talk and the use of hedges, that could be seen within \ninterviews and hearings. However, different politeness strategies were adopted e.g. \nuse formal language to emphasise the recipient\u2019s social standing. Letters are \naddressed to the licensing authority and are a FTA as they ask the authority to take \naction by refusing the licence application or granting it with limitations or conditions. \nThe adoption of a formal style is therefore a method by which the complainer attends \nto the negative face needs of the authority. We can see this strategy largely at the \nbeginning and end of letters. So, at the beginning we see adoption of a number of \nformulations, of which the following two are examples: \n \n \n36 \nPlease accept this letter as my objection to the application for any kind of \nlicence for alcohol and\/or entertainment to be allowed in [the particular \npremises]. \n \nOn behalf of the residents of [a place], we wish to formally record our \nobjection to the application on the grounds of public nuisance. \n \nBoth are formal, the second expressly acknowledged as such, and each attends to the \nface needs of the recipient e.g. \u201cplease accept this letter as my objection\u201d (first \nexample) and \u201cwe wish to formally record our objection\u201d (second example).  \nSimilarly, at the end of letters we see a number of formal requests and other politeness \nmarkers: \n \nThank you for listening to my worries. I hope you will take these on board \nwhen doing your planning. \n \nThanking you in anticipation for your careful consideration of our objections. \n \nBy thanking the licensing authority, the objector thereby recognises the face needs of \nthe recipient and, by asking that objections are taken into \u2018consideration\u2019, there is \nmerely a request and not a demand that these are taken into account. These extracts \ntherefore utilise negative politeness; there is recognition that a FTA is being \n \n37 \nperformed and appropriate strategies are adopted. This is a pattern we see throughout \nthe letters, albeit with a wide degree of variation.20\n \n \nIn contrast to these politeness strategies, the data suggests that the written form allows \nfor the most effective method of complaining. Politeness strategies are largely formal \nusages, understood as such by the participants, and once they have been completed, \nthe real business of complaining can begin. Within the letters we see some strong \ncomplaints combined with firm demands for action by the licensing authority. In the \nfollowing short letter, we see a concise and \u2018to the point\u2019 complaint where the \nobjector uses minimal politeness strategies: \n \nDear [licensing officer] \nRegarding the application for an entertainment licence on [the relevant \npremises]. \nI strongly urge you to reject the above application. We do not want or wish to \nhave extra noise pollution, traffic etc; in this quiet neighbourhood. \nOr any devaluation of our property because of this. I shall also be taking this \nmatter up with my local councillors. \nYours truly. \n[objector] \n \nUnlike the polite openings above, the objector does not simply ask for the application \nto be rejected, but is more forthright: \u201cI strongly urge you to reject the above \napplication\u201d. Although the objector could have demanded action, \u201cstrongly urge\u201d \n                                                 \n20 We could theorise that this variation is due, inter alia, to infrequent use of formal letters in an age of \ninstant communication technology. In short, formal letter writing is a dying art. \n \n38 \ncomes close and is a serious FTA. Effective communication is paramount here at the \nexpense of negative politeness and respecting the negative face needs of the recipient.  \n \n(b) Gender differences on complaining \n \nGender appears to be of importance in the framing of complaints, although our \nfindings are tentative, largely on account of the low sample size and the ambiguous \nnature of some of the evidence. That gender may be of significance accords with the \nfindings of some previous studies e.g. in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s study women were more likely \nto utilise negative politeness strategies, after accounting for context, role and social \ndifference [16]. Holmes similarly notes that when women engage in conversation they \ndo so in a manner that emphasises agreement and collaboration [10]. The extract in \njoint productions above (see 6 (e)), where an objector completed the sentence of the \napplicant in a supportive manner, provides a good example of co-operation and \nsolidarity in the performance of talk in interaction. In this instance the objector was \nfemale and the applicant male and this could be seen as an example of a female \nspeaker adopting a more polite style within the interaction.  \n \nWe see similar polite statements from other women in interviews e.g. where a female \nobjector responds to a question on the concerns raised in the objection: \n \nIt was [concern about] noise and \u2026 I think it was a little bit ambiguous [on] \nthe details that they point out about the hours that would be involved. It was \ngoing on until quite late at night; when in fact we had a meeting about it, they \nclarified the fact that they were just the latest hours that they could possibly be \n \n39 \nbut they weren\u2019t planning on having any events that would run as late as they \nsaid. I can\u2019t quite remember how long, I think it was probably 10 or 11 \no\u2019clock at night, but it didn\u2019t materialise actually. \n \nWe can see in the extract a number of hedges; \u201cI think\u201d, \u201ca little bit\u201d, \u201cquite late\u201d. \nSimilarly, there is no \u2018off record\u2019 criticism of the applicant; an assurance was made \nand the last sentence confirms that events were in accordance with this assurance. \nHowever, although there is evidence in the data of politeness in complaints from \nwomen, we also see within both letters and interviews forceful and strong complaints \nfrom women. \n \n9. Implications of the study \n \nInconsistencies in testimony and incoherence in narratives delivered by witnesses are \nusually regarded as evidence of unreliability [21]. The shifting story is viewed as a \nfalse story. We have seen, however, that the shifting story is not uncommon in \nmaking complaints. In the data analysis, there is evidence throughout of nuanced \ndifferences in the presentation of complaints depending upon the context, the method \nof production and the course that an interaction may take. For instance, the literature \nreview suggests that how a recipient reacts may well cause a different re-telling of the \ncomplaint to that initially offered and we saw evidence of this effect (see 4 (e), 5 (b) \nand 7 above). Similarly, as the researchers in telephone interviews with residents \nattempted to create rapport, the data set suggests that a supportive approach may well \nlead to more assertive (and sometimes new) complaints being made (see 7 above). \nFurther, although politeness strategies were utilised in letters through adoption of \n \n40 \nformal language, there was increased adoption of politeness strategies in hearings \nwhen the applicant was present in the room (see 8 above). This is notwithstanding that \nat this time complainants need to make the strongest case possible, since the decision \nwould be made following the hearing. This seems to run counter to the prevailing \nview that, when a witness changes a story, this is evidence of unreliability and it is \napparent that shifting stories are not necessarily indicative of a witnesses\u2019 credibility \n(or, rather, lack of it).21\n \n \nAs accounts differed subtly in response to recipient reaction, this has implications for \nlegal professionals and how they elicit complaints. This is not to say that professionals \nneed training in how to uncover more \u2018authentic\u2019 stories, but rather it requires an \nappreciation of the socially constructed nature of accounts. So, if professionals are too \nagreeable and approachable, witnesses may well provide accounts that will be \ndowngraded in formal contexts so that they will either be regarded as unreliable or \nthey may not come up to proof. Conversely, if professionals eliciting a story are too \nconfrontational, the events may be downgraded and witnesses may not provide \nimportant details that evidence a complaint.  \n \nWe need also to consider the appropriateness of hearsay restrictions, which may well \nimpact upon a common tactic utilised by complainers, that of complainers routinely \nco-opting others into their complaint to objectify it and demonstrate that the problem \nis real because of its effect on others (see 5 (c) (i) above). Hearsay restrictions \ntherefore appear to inhibit an everyday method of complaining, thereby resulting in \nconfusion for witnesses [22, p. 265-6]. However, the impact of hearsay restrictions \n                                                 \n21 See further [21]. \n \n41 \nmay be confined in scope, since hearsay restrictions do not apply in licensing \nhearings22 and are limited in civil cases more generally under the Civil Evidence Act \n1995.23\n \n  \nContextual differences noted in the data were subtle so should not be overplayed. The \nmajority of the data pointed towards effectiveness of communication as being \nparamount, with most objectors adopting strategies that reinforced complaints rather \nthan attending to face needs. This, as explained in the literature review, could simply \nbe a result of the institutional context of the complaints studied; making legal claims \nnecessitates clearing an institutional hurdle (see 4 (d) above). Alternatively, this could \nbe viewed as an area of \u2018conflict talk\u2019 when the usual politeness conventions do not \napply [9]. Given that complaints here are indirect, and do not necessarily concern the \nrecipient, this would be an extension of \u2018conflict talk\u2019 into an area where there is not \ndirect conflict between the parties. \n \nFinally, we want to express some thoughts that may well explain the emphasis on \nproducing effective complaints. It is regarded as a truism that we no longer live in a \ndeferential society; this closing of social distance, if we follow Brown and Levinson\u2019s \ntheory, could be expected to result in changes to the politeness strategies that speakers \nadopt. However, it could be said that we are now experiencing something different \n                                                 \n22 See Westminster City Council v Zestfair Ltd (1989) 153 JP 613 and Kavanagh v Chief Constable of \nDevon and Cornwall [1974] QB 624. \n23 Although s 1 of the 1995 Act abolishes the rule making hearsay evidence inadmissible in civil \nproceedings, this applies only in respect of hearsay as defined in the Act. The definition, in s 1(2), \nprovides that \u201chearsay\u201d means \u201ca statement made otherwise than by a person while giving oral \nevidence in the proceedings which is tendered as evidence of the matters stated\u201d. This may exclude \nhearsay which does not consist of statements made, but which comprises conduct about which a person \ngives evidence, e.g. as in R v Kearley [1992] 2 AC 228, where police evidence of calls by telephone \nand calls at the door of a person\u2019s flat inquiring about the purchase of drugs was tendered as evidence \nof that person being a supplier of drugs. Such evidence was held, by the House of Lords, to be \ninadmissible hearsay in that case and, as it would fall outside s 1(2), it would continue to be \ninadmissible after the 1995 Act. \n \n42 \nfrom the decline of deference and instead a movement towards a more emotive \nsociety. We need only think of the use of crime victims and their families in press \nconferences and appeals for information; emotional displays are fundamental to these \nevents. Similarly, Lorenzo-Dus outlines the centrality of emotional displays in US \ncourtroom television programmes and notes that \u201c[t]ogether with conflict talk shows, \ncourtroom shows offer one of the clearest examples of the ritual celebration of \n\u2018negative\u2019 emotions in contemporary broadcasting\u201d [14, p. 85]. We can also see this at \nplay within the UK, as in celebrities eating various animal parts in I\u2019m a Celebrity or \nthe contestants of Big Brother being subjected to degrading tasks. In short, we \nroutinely engage in the ritual humiliation of others in the name of entertainment. \nBrown and Levinson would regard this increase in emotional displays as a change in \n\u201cethos\u201d [2, p. 243]. We could hypothesise that our society is changing to one that is \nmore direct with comments increasingly made \u2018on record\u2019 with a premium placed on \neffectiveness rather than politeness. Indeed, Brown and Levinson suggest that social \ndistance and solidarity are loosened by \u201cmobility and ambition\u201d [2, p. 246]. A more \ncompetitive and individualistic society is more likely to perform FTAs directly and \n\u2018on record\u2019. So, perhaps the predominance in the data of attending to effectiveness \nrather than politeness is the result of an overall shift in ethos, rather than something \ninherent in the setting. If this is correct, what are the implications for positive and \nnegative face generally? Are we less likely to attend to the positive and negative face \nneeds of speakers in an emotionally charged society where assertiveness is valued and \ntherefore more likely to adhere to Yaeger-Dror\u2019s CPP principle (see 4 (a) above)? Or \nare the examples provided in this conclusion simply mere entertainment, an escape \nfrom the shackles of informal and formal expectations embedded within social \ninteraction? \n \n43 \nAcknowledgments \n \nWe are grateful to Professor Roy Light, Emeritus Professor of Law, University of \nWest of England, for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of the article; our \nresearch subjects for their willing co-operation, and, in particular, the principal \nlicensing officers in the two licensing authorities for providing access to files and \narranging interviews; Gemma Turton for help with transcribing interviews; and the \nSociety of Legal Scholars\u2019 for funding the research through its Academic Purposes \nFund. \n \nReferences \n \n1.
