Introduction\nDermatophytes are responsible for causing superficial infections in keratinised\ntissues of humans and animals. The predominant pathogens in humans being\nTrichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, while Microsporun canis, T.\nverrucosum are examples of animal pathogens [1]. Clinically it is important to\nidentify the species causing infections in order to enable appropriate treatment.\nHowever, conventional techniques comprising microscopy, culture and biochemical\ntests are tedious, time consuming and require skilled personel.\nMoreover, conventional strain typing of species is also difficult because of the lack\nof stable characteristics such as colony morphology or microscopic appearance. These\ncharacteristics are not easily noticeable when subcultured, or might be artifacts due to\ngrowth conditions or contaminating bacteria [2]. Thus hampering the identification of\nstrain-related differences, which could serve to be useful for answering certain\nepidemiological questions such as sources of infection or strains belonging to a\nspecific geographical area. It would also help in identifying the types of infection\ncaused (i.e. skin or nail) in addition to determining the cause of relapse (i.e. either\nbeing a failure in treatment or infection by a new strain) [3].\nMolecular approaches for species identification and strain typing have been studied\nsuch as PCR, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), restriction\nfragment length polymorphisim (RFLP) and restriction enzyme analysis [2,3,4].\nThese have shown promise, although tend not to be feasible for routine clinical\npurposes apart from being complex, laborious and expensive with respect to certain\nequipment and associated materials.\nSahgal et. al. [5] have previously reported that volatile fingerprint patterns by\nmeans of an electronic nose (e-nose), enabled differentiation between certain\nTrichophyton species. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the potential\nof using volatile production patterns for (a) strain differentiation of the two common\nTrichophyton species and for (b) identifying\/discriminating between species infecting\nhumans and animals using e-nose technology.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1 Fungal species and media\nIn order to investigate the discrimination between the dermatophyte species\ninfecting humans and animals, two Trichophyton type cultures (T. mentagrophytes,\nNCPF:224; T. rubrum, D12) and an isolated Microsporum culture from dogs (M.\ncanis, M177) were used.\nFor investigating the differentiation between strains of two individual species five\nstrains of T. mentagrophytes (including strains M61, M62, M63 and M64) and four\nstrains of T. rubrum (including strains R55, R57 and R59) were studied. The type\ncultures were obtained from the National Collection of Pathogenic Fungi (NCPF),\nBristol, U.K. and other cultures were kindly provided by Prof. F. J. Caba\u00f1es,\nAutonomous University of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.\nCultures were grown on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), prepared in house by\nmixing 10 g L-1 mycological peptone (Amersham, Little Chalfont, U.K.), 40 g L-1\nglucose (Acros Chemicals) and 15 g L-1 agar Technical No. 3 (Oxoid) with a small\namount of chloramphenicol (Sigma); and incubated at 25 \u00b0C.\n2.2 Sample preparation\nSpore suspensions were prepared by harvesting spores from three week old\ncultures with a loop and suspending them in 10 ml sterile RO water and Tween 80\n(Acros Chemicals). At least 25 replicate agar plates for each species and\/or strains\nwere inoculated with 250 \u00b5l of 106 spores ml-1 suspensions to make a spore lawn over\nthe agar surface. The inoculum range for inter-species discrimination was \u2248 4.6 x 106\nspores ml-1, while the inoculum for the strains discrimination ranged from \u2248 8.5 x 106\nand \u2248 2.9 x 106 spores ml-1 for the two Trichophyton species, T. mentagrophytes and\nT. rubrum respectively. Blank agar plates served as controls for the experiments. The\ntreatments were incubated at room temperature i.e. 25 \u00b0C for a period of 24 to 120\nhours.\n2.3 E-nose and data analysis\nEvery 24 hours five replicates for each fungal treatment were destructively\nsampled. Four 2 cm diameter discs of the treatments were placed in 25 ml glass vials\nand sealed with septa and screw caps. These were then set aside for one hour to\nequilibrate at room temperature for headspace generation above the sample. Samples\nwere then randomly placed in the NST 3320 Lab Emission Analyser (Applied\nSensors, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden), a 24 sensor hybrid e-nose comprising 12 MOS sensors,\n10 MOSFET sensors, a capacitance based humidity (relative humidity) sensor and an\nIR-based CO2 sensor, for headspace analysis. The data generated were analysed using\nthe built-in software package - NST Senstool and MATLAB 7.3 (The Mathworks\nInc., Natick, MA). Data interpretation was carried out by applying multivariate\nstatistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and heirarchical\ncluster analysis (HCA) on the obtained sensor responses.\n3. Results\n3.1 Inter-species discrimination\nT. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum and M. canis were studied in order to investigate the\npotential of discriminating between dermatophytes causing human and animal\ninfections using their volatile fingerprint production patterns. Initial experiments\nindicate possible differentiation between the fungal species. Figure 1 shows a PCA\nscores plot of the separation between the samples after 120 hours incubation at 25 \u00b0C.\nThe first two principal components accounted for approximately 94% of the variance\nin the data.\nCluster analysis performed on the same data set using just the first two principal\ncomponents also showed a similar result. The dendrogram (Figure 2) was constructed\nusing Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s linkage measure. Although, four distinct groups\ncan be visualised, one sample from C was clustered as belonging to R possibly an\noutlier.\n3.2 Differentiation between strains of T. mentagrophytes\nFive strains of T. mentagrophytes were examined to study the effects of their\nVOCs produced to facilitate discrimination\/similarity amongst strains. Results suggest\nthat the controls can be separated from the strains\/treatments after about 48 hours, but\nthis was more clearly evident over 72 hours. However, even after 96-120 hours\nstrains could not be differentiated from each other (Figure 3).\n3.3 Discrimination between T. rubrum strains\nTo investigate the potential of discriminating between strains of T. rubrum based\non their volatile profiles, four strains were examined. Initial experiments indicated\nthat within 120 hours it was possible to differentiate between controls and three of the\nstrains of this fungal species \u2013 R, R55 and R57. The PCA scores plot in Figure 4\ndepicts the separation between the samples after 120 hours incubation. The data\naccounted for approximately 86% of the variance in the first two principal\ncomponents.\nSubsequent cluster analysis on the data also showed that strains R, R55 and R57\ncould be clustered while the controls and R59 could not be effectively discriminated\n(Figure 5). However, a sample from R55 was shown to be clustered with R. The\ndendrogram was constructed as described previously.\n4. Discussion\nThe use of an electronic nose for identifying Trichophyton species has been\npreviously reported by Sahgal et. al.(2006), whereby successful discrimination was\nobtained within 96-120 hours [5]. Here a similar approach has been extended to\ninclude other dermatophyte species to broaden the detection and discriminating\npotential for both human and animal infecting species. Almost clear discrimination\nbetween the sample groups was observed after 120 hours, suggesting potential of\ndistinguishing human from animal pathogens. This could prove to be significant from\nthe clinician\u2019s perspective, in terms of prescribing drugs and starting the correct\ntreatment. Nevertheless, further studies are required to draw definite conclusions.\nIf species identification is important for administration of appropriate drugs, then\nstrain differentiation can serve to be essential for monitoring drug resistance,\nespecially in the event of treatment failure, in the strains of these species. A variety of\nmolecular typing methods have been employed for strain recognition of\ndermatophytes. For example, previous studies have reported either the inability to\ndistinguish between strains of T. rubrum, or some minor differences being shown for\na small number of strains [6, 7] using these techniques. However, Jackson et. al. [4]\nshowed that RFLP analysis of the nontranscribed spacer regions of the ribosomal-\nDNA enabled T. rubrum strain differentiation. Furthermore, no correlation was\nobserved for strain typing of T. mentagrophytes by restriction enzyme analysis on\ninternal transcribed spacer regions of DNA [2]. These techniques although useful, are\nnot suited for a clinical setting.\nVolatile production patterns of these two species have also indicated positive\noutcomes in terms of differentiation between strains. In case of T. rubrum slower\ngrowth rate of some the strains could explain the inability to distinguish it from the\ncontrols, suggesting greater strain variation in this species. This could also imply that\nthe volatile patterns of the strains pertaining to these species might be slightly\ndifferent from each other. On the other hand, no distinction between strains of T.\nmentagrophytes could be due to a great deal of similarity between the strains\nindicating that their volatile fingerprints hardly differ. However, further studies are\nneeded to fine-tune the use of the e-nose for such an application.\nPrevious reports have also shown the use of different kinds of e-noses for strain\ndifferentiation of fungi, especially those detrimental to the food industry owing to\ntoxin production, which then adversely affects consumers. In one study [8] it was\npossible to differentiate between mycotoxigenic and non-mycotoxigenic strains of\nfood spoilage fungi Fusarium moniliforme and F. proliferatum respectively, within 48\nhours using a conducting polymer sensor array. Falasconi et. al. [9] also demonstrated\nthat a MOS e-nose could classify the strains of F. verticillioides based on their\ntoxigenic behaviour on agar as well as on grain. Furthermore, Needham and Magan\n[10] examined Penicillium verrucosum strains for production of ochratoxin as\nopposed to those that did not produce the toxin using conducting polymer sensors.\n5. Conclusion\nThis study had demonstrated the ability of the electronic nose to efficiently\ndecreasing the time needed for identification of dermatophytes causing human and\nanimal infections including strains of certain species in a quick and reproducible\nmanner. We have also shown that there is little variation between strains of some\ndermatophyte species, while for others there are intra-strain differences. This study\nshows the capability of developing neural networks based on the data now available\nto examine and classify unknown clinical samples.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. B.
