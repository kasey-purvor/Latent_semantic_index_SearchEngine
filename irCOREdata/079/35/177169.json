In resource-limited\nconsultations, performing these other goal-directed behaviours may influence optimal performance of a particular\nevidence-based behaviour. This study aimed to investigate whether a multiple goal-directed behaviour perspective\nmight inform implementation research beyond single-behaviour approaches.\nMethods: We conducted theory-based semi-structured interviews with 12 general medical practitioners (GPs)\nin Scotland on their views regarding two focal clinical behaviours--providing physical activity (PA) advice and\nprescribing to reduce blood pressure (BP) to <140\/80 mmHg--in consultations with patients with diabetes and\npersistent hypertension. Theory-based constructs investigated were: intention and control beliefs from the\ntheory of planned behaviour, and perceived interfering and facilitating influence of other goal-directed behaviours\nperformed in a diabetes consultation. We coded interview content into pre-specified theory-based constructs\nand organised codes into themes within each construct using thematic analysis.\nResults: Most GPs reported strong intention to prescribe to reduce BP but expressed reasons why they would\nnot. Intention to provide PA advice was variable. Most GPs reported that time constraints and patient preference\ndetrimentally affected their control over providing PA advice and prescribing to reduce BP, respectively. Most\nGPs perceived many of their other goal-directed behaviours as interfering with providing PA advice, while fewer\nGPs reported goal-directed behaviours that interfere with prescribing to reduce BP. Providing PA advice and\nprescribing to reduce BP were perceived to be facilitated by similar diabetes-related behaviours (e.g., discussing\ncholesterol). While providing PA advice was perceived to be mainly facilitated by providing other lifestyle-related\nclinical advice (e.g., talking about weight), BP prescribing was reported as facilitated by pursuing ongoing standard\nconsultation-related goals (e.g., clearly structuring the consultation).\nConclusion: GPs readily relate their other goal-directed behaviours with having a facilitating and interfering\ninfluence on their performance of particular evidence-based behaviours. This may have implications for advancing\nthe theoretical development of behavioural approaches to implementation research beyond single-behaviour\nmodels.\nPublished: 26 November 2009\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 doi:10.1186\/1748-5908-4-77\nReceived: 24 May 2009\nAccepted: 26 November 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77\n\u00a9 2009 Presseau et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77Background\nTranslation of research evidence into clinical practice\nremains a challenge [1,2]. The behavioural sciences pro-\nvide a number of well-developed, operationalised, and\ntested models of human behaviour that generalise across\ncontexts that can inform implementation research [3].\nAmong models with the best predictive utility is the The-\nory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [4]. Applied to a health-\ncare professional context, the TPB has been used to predict\nbehaviour [5], evaluate change [6], develop behaviour\nchange interventions [3], and as a framework for qualita-\ntive investigation [7]. A core assumption of the TPB is that\nthe two most important determinants of whether a health\nprofessional will perform any particular behaviour are\nhow strongly they intend to (behavioural intention) and\nwhether they feel they can (i.e., their perceived behav-\nioural control). The model also specifies predictors whose\neffect on behaviour is mediated by the health profes-\nsional's intention: what they think about the conse-\nquences of performing the behaviour (their attitude),\ntheir perception of other influential people's views about\nthem performing it (their subjective norms), and, again,\ntheir perceived behavioural control. Underlying each of\nthese three constructs are associated specific beliefs:\nbehavioural (about the outcome of performing the behav-\niour), normative (about how important other people\nwant them to act), and control beliefs (about factors that\nmake it difficult or easy to perform the behaviour).\nReviews of predictive prospective studies suggest that this\nmodel accounts relatively well for the variation in health-\ncare professional behaviour [5,8]. However, the model is\nnot without its critics [9,10], and further theoretical devel-\nopment to inform implementation efforts seems war-\nranted. For instance, there is a recognised need for further\ndevelopment of behavioural theories to better understand\nand promote health professionals' efficient uptake of\nguideline recommendations [1].\nAs with most quality improvement research, most\n(though not all [11] [Presseau J, Sniehotta FF, Francis JJ,\nGebhardt WA: With a little help from my goals: Integrat-\ning intergoal facilitation with the theory of planned\nbehaviour to predict physical activity, Submitted]) appli-\ncations of the TPB isolate behaviours from the wider con-\ntext of multiple behaviours and multiple goals pursued.\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of the studies in sys-\ntematic reviews of tests of social cognition models with\nhealth professionals [5,8] considered whether performing\nmultiple goal-directed behaviours was perceived to influ-\nence a focal behaviour of interest. It seems unlikely that\nthe performance of one goal-directed behaviour is iso-\nlated from the performance of another, particularly in\nbusy clinical settings. This study therefore aimed to\nexplore whether and to what extent GPs attribute their\nperformance of a particular evidence-based behaviour to\nbeing influenced by other goal-directed behaviours they\nperform in a consultation.\nInterference and facilitation between healthcare delivery \ngoal-directed behaviours\nCompeting demands may affect the delivery of evidence-\nbased diabetes healthcare [12]. For instance, lack of time\ndue to competing demands is a frequently identified bar-\nrier to implementing guideline recommendations\n[13,14]. Duration of consultations with GPs in the UK is\nlimited to an average of 9.4 minutes [15]. This constraint\nmight result in a GP wanting and needing to perform a\nnumber of goal-directed behaviours in a consultation, but\nbeing unable to perform them all. Sources of competing\ndemands in clinical consultations often include patient,\nphysician, and contextual factors [16]. Each of these may\nlead the GP to perform a behaviour in order to pursue a\nparticular goal. For instance, elements on the patient's\nagenda (e.g., 'get advice for weight loss') can provide com-\npeting demands by first being perceived by the GP, and\nthen generating additional goal-directed behaviours for\nthe GP (e.g., 'give weight loss advice') to be performed\nduring the consultation. Furthermore, GPs have their own\nagenda for the consultation involving them performing\nmany goal-directed behaviours. Perceived competing\ndemands can thus be viewed as the behaviours performed\nby the GP to pursue the goals for the consultation--their\ngoal-directed behaviours--informed by what they want to\nand\/or need to do based on contextual and patient fac-\ntors. For instance, during a diabetes consultation the GP\nmay measure blood pressure (BP), increase dosage of\nACE-Inhibitor to reduce BP, prescribe a statin, measure\nfoot pulses, provide advice on diet and exercise, discuss\nrisks and also respond to issues that the patient brings up,\nand try to finish on time, amongst others. GPs' manage-\nment of diabetes in a clinical consultation can therefore\nbe conceptualised as a system of goal-directed behaviours\nthat they perform to provide optimal patient care, which\nall compete for the limited resources available.\nLimited resources lead to three potentially overlapping\nrelationships between goal-directed behaviours [17]. Pur-\nsuing one goal may: interfere with pursuing another,\neither by accounting for time available or due to an\nincompatibility (e.g., checking lipids and prescribing stat-\nins in response to test results are incompatible goals for a\nparticular consultation because blood tests are not instan-\ntaneous); facilitate pursuing another, either instrumen-\ntally (e.g., providing dietary advice for weight loss can lead\nto providing exercise advice) or due to overlapping means\n(e.g., prescribing an ACE-inhibitor pursues the goals of\nachieving a contract target and lowering BP); or be inde-\npendent of pursuing another (which is less likely in\nresource-constrained settings). Goal interference has been\nrelated to performance in professional contexts, includingPage 2 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77call-centres [18] and with university academics [19]. Some\nresearch has investigated the effect of goal interference on\nperformance of health behaviours such as exercise,\nthough this effect is not as clear [17,20]. Goal facilitation\nhas received comparatively less research attention, though\na prospective correlational study found that facilitating\ngoals predicted variance in health behaviour [17]. This\neffect has been subsequently shown to be partially medi-\nated by the TPB, indicating that perceived goal facilitation\nhas both a direct and indirect effect on health behaviour\n[Presseau J, Sniehotta FF, Francis JJ, Gebhardt WA: With a\nlittle help from my goals: Integrating intergoal facilitation\nwith the theory of planned behaviour to predict physical\nactivity, Submitted]. The effect of perceived goal interfer-\nence and facilitation may be increasingly relevant to more\nconstrained settings such as clinical consultations. Tools,\nsuch as personal projects analysis [21], provide a replica-\nble methodology for eliciting personally salient multiple\ngoal-directed behaviours and assessing their perceived\ninfluence on performance of a particular goal-directed\nbehaviour in a particular context [22]. Incorporating the\nrole of GPs' competing goal-directed behaviours in a dia-\nbetes consultation is a new approach which may inform\nsingle-behaviour operationalisations of behavioural mod-\nels such as the TPB used to investigate health professional\nbehaviour.\nPhysical activity and BP control in the diabetes \nconsultation\nTight BP control and physical activity can reduce the risk\nof developing diabetes-related complications [23,24].\nHowever, many people with diabetes do not meet recom-\nmended BP and physical activity levels. In Scotland, 74%\nof women and 58% of men with type 2 diabetes engage in\nless than 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity per week, compared to 41% of women and 36%\nof men without type 2 diabetes [25]. Primary care physi-\ncians are recognised as being at the front line of diabetes\nmanagement [26]. The role of the GP has been defined to\ninclude 'promoting health, preventing disease, and pro-\nviding cure, care, or palliation. This is done either directly\nor through the services of others according to health needs\nand the resources available within the community they\nserve, and assisting patients where necessary in accessing\nthese services. [27]'However patient surveys found that\nonly one-half of patients with diabetes received exercise\nadvice in their last visit to the GP [28], and three-quarters\nreported having ever received exercise advice from a\nhealthcare professional [29]. In the UK, an incentive struc-\nture is built into the contract of GPs that remunerates for\nachieving predefined quality targets [30], known as Qual-\nity and Outcomes Framework (QOF) points. For example,\nfor the management of diabetes, one of the targets\n(DM12) currently remunerates GPs when up to 60% of\ntheir patients with diabetes achieve a BP of \u2264145\/85\nmmHg at their last reading. Notably, this target level is\nhigher than the current UK and Scottish guideline recom-\nmendation of <140\/80 mmHg [31,32]. QOF data col-\nlected in primary care practices in the north-east of\nScotland showed that a mean of 77.8% (standard devia-\ntion 7.7%) of people with diabetes achieved a BP of \u2264145\/\n85 mmHg [33]. However, between-practice variation\nranged from 59.5% to 100% of patients. Thus, despite evi-\ndence-based guideline recommendations detailing effec-\ntive pharmacological means of reducing BP to evidenced\ntargets [31,32,34] and providing physical activity advice\nin primary care [35,36], implementation remains subop-\ntimal. Better implementation of the evidence in these\nguideline recommendations could have important impli-\ncations for risk reduction.\nDrawing upon existing theory and methods from the\nbehavioural sciences, this study represents a preliminary\nstage in a series of studies aiming to investigate how com-\npeting goal-directed behaviours influence health profes-\nsionals' evidence-based motivation and action.\nMethods\nSampling and recruitment procedures\nWe recruited a purposive heterogeneous sample of 12 GPs\nfrom ten practices in NHS Grampian (Scotland) to repre-\nsent variation in gender, age, and rural\/urban practice.\nPurposive heterogeneity sampling was used so that a vari-\nety of views could be studied. We targeted clinical col-\nleagues of one of the authors (NCC). Fourteen GPs were\ninformally contacted via email; twelve indicated their\ninterest in participating and were subsequently formally\ninvited via email or telephone within one week of the ini-\ntial approach to arrange a time and location for being\ninterviewed. Pragmatic sample size considerations were\nmade on the basis of advice from Guest, Bunce, and John-\nson, who found that they developed 92% of codes within\nthe first 12 (of 60) interviews conducted [37].\nData collection procedure\nSemi-structured one-to-one interviews investigated factors\nthat GP's perceived facilitate and hinder their perform-\nance of two particular behaviours within the diabetes con-\nsultation they are most involved in: provision of physical\nactivity advice and prescription of anti-hypertensive med-\nication to those with persistent high BP to control it to evi-\ndence-based guideline levels of <140\/80 mmHg.\nInterviews were preferred over other methods as they pro-\nvided the best fit with the theory-development research\nquestions, allowing us to prompt participants for further\nelaboration. The interview topic guide was piloted with\none GP, and amended subsequent to piloting and\nthroughout the study to maximise content and feasibility\nwithin the target time (30 minutes; see Additional File 1\nfor final topic guide). Interviews lasted on average 31 min-Page 3 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77utes (range = 21 to 53 minutes), and all (except one\nphone interview) were conducted face-to-face either in an\noffice at each general practice or else at a pre-arranged\nalternative location if requested. Upon obtaining signed\nconsent from participating GPs, interviews were digitally\nrecorded. All interviews were conducted by JP from 19\nMarch to 30 July 2008.\nAnalysis\nInterviews were transcribed verbatim and then content\nanalysed by JP using N-Vivo 7. We defined a coding\nscheme a priori based on the theory-based constructs of\ninterest (i.e., control beliefs, intention, goal facilitation,\nand goal interference). Self-reported past behaviour was\nincluded to identify the extent to which these behaviours\nwere performed. Construct definitions used for coding\nfollowed advice and examples from the literature\n[17,38,39]. Content relating to each theory-based con-\nstruct was identified and coded from each interview by JP,\nthen organised into representative themes for each theory-\nbased construct using thematic analysis [40]. Analysis of\nthe content within each theme was reviewed by a practis-\ning GP (NCC) who independently organised the coded\ncontent for each construct into representative themes. Dis-\nagreements were resolved by discussion. Coded content\nfor perceived intergoal facilitation and interference were\nfurther analysed along a temporal dimension to investi-\ngate the relative duration of perceived intergoal relation-\nships.\nInter-rater reliability\nThree independent researchers double-coded the tran-\nscripts to assess the inter-rater reliability of coding for con-\ntrol beliefs, goal interference, and goal facilitation. Each\ndouble-coder was assigned a random sample of interview\ntranscripts along with instruction materials and practice\ncoding. We used an iterative double-coding procedure. In\nstep one, JP developed instruction materials and a practice\nsheet that an independent coder then used to code a ran-\ndom set of three interview transcripts. Coding results were\ncompared and discussed in depth throughout this step of\nthe double-coding procedure to clarify ambiguities or dif-\nficulties in the coding material instructions. Inter-rater\nreliability indices were not calculated at this step, given\nthe extent of discussion between the coder and JP. In step\ntwo, we aimed to refine the instruction materials. A sec-\nond coder was presented with the modified instruction\nmaterials and independently coded another random sam-\nple of four transcripts (overlap between coders one and\ntwo on one transcript). The coder and JP then compared\ncoding and discussed discrepancies until a consensus was\nreached. Ambiguities in the instructions were discussed to\nfurther clarify the materials for the final double-coder.\nInter-rater reliability at step two was tested using Krippen-\ndorff's alpha [41] over all constructs was \u03b1 = 0.72 (95%CI\n0.58 to 0.84). In step three, we conducted a final double-\ncoding using the refined instructions. A third independent\ncoder was provided with another random set of four tran-\nscripts to code from the remaining transcripts not yet dou-\nble-coded, along with the finalised instructions.\nDiscrepancies were discussed until a consensus was\nreached. In this final step, all constructs met the criterion\nfor acceptable inter-rater reliability of Krippendorf's \u03b1 =\n0.80 [42]. Over all three constructs, \u03b1 = 0.84 (95%CI 0.68\nto 0.96). For control beliefs, \u03b1 = 0.86 (95%CI 0.68 to\n1.00), for goal interference, \u03b1 = 0.85 (95%CI 0.39 to 1.00)\nand for goal facilitation, \u03b1 = 0.82 (95%CI 0.64 to 0.96).\nConstruct-specific coding\nControl beliefs\nControl beliefs were identified as any belief about factors\nor circumstances reported to make it easier, or difficult or\nimpossible for GPs to perform the focal prescribing and\nadvising behaviours. This was explicitly distinguished\nfrom behavioural beliefs, which focus on beliefs about the\nconsequences of the behaviour, and normative beliefs,\nwhich focus on beliefs about which important other indi-\nviduals or groups might approve of performing the behav-\niour or not [39].\nIntention and past behaviour\nWe coded the strength of the GP's intention and the pro-\nportion of their next five patients with whom they\nintended to perform each focal behaviour, as well as the\nnumber of their last five patients with whom GPs self-\nreported performing each focal behaviour. We considered\nattributions for why GPs did not pursue each focal goal\nwith all of the last five patients, or intended to with all of\ntheir next five patients, as potential control beliefs, behav-\nioural beliefs, or normative beliefs, as well as potential\nsources of goal interference or goal facilitation.\nGoal facilitation and goal interference\nWe identified and coded all the goals and behaviours that\nGPs reported as facilitating and\/or interfering with per-\nforming the two target behaviours. Both explicit and\ncoder-inferred goal interference and facilitation were\ncoded. Goal facilitation was defined as any behaviour per-\nformed or goal pursued by the GP which either helpfully\nled to or had overlapping attainment strategies with the\ntwo target behaviours. Goal interference was defined as\nany behaviour performed or goal pursued by the GP that\nhindered or made it less likely that they would perform\nthe two target behaviours.\nResults\nParticipants\nThe 12 participating GPs' ages ranged from 29 to 50 years\n(mean = 40.3 years), and five were women. One-half of\nGPs had an affiliation with a university, and one-halfPage 4 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77practised in a rural setting. Graduation year ranged from\n1981 to 2003 (median = 1989.5). GP contract (QOF) data\nfrom 2007\/2008 for the percentage of patients with diabe-\ntes reaching a BP target of \u2264145\/85 mmHg indicated that\nparticipants' practices achieved this target with 75.60%\n(range greater than 20%) of their patients [33]. Six GPs\nreported aiming for a BP guideline target of \u2264140\/80\nmmHg, four reported aiming for the GP contract (QOF)\ntarget of \u2264145\/85 mmHg, two reported aiming for a range\nrather than a specific target, and one GP reported prescrib-\ning until the patient no longer took the medication or had\nside effects. There was thus adequate heterogeneity on the\nkey sample characteristics.\nPast behaviour\nThere was considerable variation in GP's self-reported\nprovision of physical activity (PA) advice with their last\nfive patients with diabetes with persistent hypertension,\nranging from 'Probably none' (ID1, male, 43, rural) to 'at\nleast three out of five I would say' (ID5, male, 41, urban)\nthrough to 'I would say all of them actually, in different\ndegrees' (ID4, female, 34, rural). GPs reported providing\nPA advice to a median of two out of their last five patients\nwith diabetes with persistent hypertension (range 0 to 5\npatients). GPs reported prescribing to reduce BP with a\nmedian of 2.25 of their last five patients (range 0 to 4).\nReports ranged from 'I think the last five patients, proba-\nbly none actually' (ID3, female, 29, rural), through to 'I\nwould say about four out of five' (ID11, male, 50, urban).\nIntention\nStrength of intention to provide PA advice ranged\nbetween GPs from strong 'I think it's quite a strong inten-\ntion' (ID2, female, 35, urban), 'it's relatively strong'\n(ID10, male, 47, rural) to weak 'fairly low I think, fairly\nlow'(ID11, male, 50, urban). GPs reported intending to\ngive PA advice to a median of 2.5 out of their next five\npatients (range 1.5 to 4), though one GP said 'almost\nnone' (ID1, male, 43, rural) and another indicated 'if they\nare all overweight I would say it to all of them' (ID12,\nfemale, 30, rural). Strength of intention to prescribe to\nreduce BP was generally strong, but also depended upon\nother factors: 'so your intention is quite strong but there\nare so many other things that have to come into play'\n(ID2, female, 35, urban), 'well, just that you would\n[intend]. ... I definitely couldn't blanket say what I do with\na group of patients as a whole' (ID3, female, 29, rural),\n'well it depends on the class of drug they are already on'\n(ID9, male, 42, urban). GPs reported intending to pre-\nscribe to a median of 4.5 of their next five patients (range\n= 1 to 5). One GP mentioned 'I think that's very difficult\nto say because it's totally on an individual basis' (ID12,\nfemale, 34, rural).\nControl beliefs\nWe grouped control-related factors that GPs reported as\nmaking it easier or difficult for them to provide PA advice\nand prescribe to reduce BP into categories representative\nof similar content (See Additional File 2). All 12 GPs men-\ntioned at least one control belief. Most reported that con-\nsultation factors and in particular that time-related\npressures (mentioned by eight GPs) impeded their con-\ntrol over providing physical activity advice. For prescrib-\ning to reduce BP however, time pressures were highlighted\nby only three GPs. Most GPs reported that patient factors,\nnamely patient preference for not wanting medication\n(mentioned by eight GPs), made it difficult for them to\nprescribe. We coded these as control beliefs because GPs\nbelieved that the patients' behaviour during the consulta-\ntion affected their opportunity to perform their consist-\nently strongly intended prescribing behaviour. This\ndecision was made on the basis of Ajzen's definition of\ncontrol beliefs, which suggests that it is a belief that 'deals\nwith the presence or absence of requisite resources and\nopportunities' [4]. Had this been a subjective norm influ-\nence, the observed strong intention would not be\nexpected. Thus, we viewed GPs' report of 'patient prefer-\nence for not wanting a prescription' as a behaviour that\nthe patient performs during the consultation that the GP\nbelieves affects their opportunity to prescribe in the con-\nsultation--i.e., a control belief. One-half reported that\npatient factors (i.e., patient interest and patient triggering\nthe GP) made it easier for them to provide physical activ-\nity advice, though consultation factors (in particular 'hav-\ning time'--three GPs) were also mentioned. For\nprescribing to reduce BP, patient factors were described as\nmaking it easier for GPs to prescribe, and in particular\nwhether the patient is informed\/understands the impor-\ntance of BP in their diabetes management (five GPs). Con-\nsultation factors such as having time to discuss BP (three\nGPs) and having continuity of care (three GPs) were also\nseen as making it easier to prescribe. Overall, while GPs\nhad relatively higher intention to prescribe than to give\nadvice, BP prescribing was associated with more control\nbeliefs.\nGoal interference\nTable 1 shows that ten participants mentioned goal-\ndirected behaviours that they perceived as interfering with\nproviding PA advice, and seven GPs mentioned goal-\ndirected behaviours perceived to interfere with prescribing\nto reduce BP. The majority of coded goal interference was\nelicited beyond control belief-related questions (92% of\ncodes for BP prescribing and 82% for PA advice). Three\nparticipants mentioned that pursuing contract targets (i.e.,\nrelated to the GP contract) interfered with providing PA\nadvice: 'it's the danger of targets and that they focus you\non the targets which is their point, but it focuses you away\nfrom the non-targeted activities' (ID11, male, 50, urban).Page 5 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77More GPs perceived that goal-directed behaviours related\nto the consultation in general interfered with providing\nPA advice than prescribing to reduce BP. Furthermore, the\ngoal-directed behaviours perceived to interfere with PA\nadvice had an enduring quality, e.g., other priorities 'I\nthink it's been squeezed out by everything else' (ID1,\nmale, 43, rural); 'the nature of the beast is that I've got\nthree things to cover here that need to be covered, and it\ntakes less priority' (ID2, female, 35, urban). Conversely,\nthe consultation goal-directed behaviours perceived as\ninterfering with prescribing to reduce BP were more tran-\nsient, e.g., 'we need to capture a certain core of informa-\ntion for contract, so if it was kind of much last time we're\ngoing to see this patient this year, we've got to do blood\nscreening, and BP treatment would probably be deferred\nuntil April or May' (ID6, male, 35, urban); 'I think the last\nfive patients, probably none of them actually because I\nthink it's all been patients with colds or I've seen them as\na one-off' (ID3, female, 29, rural).\nParticipants perceived goal-directed behaviours specifi-\ncally related to diabetes as interfering with both target\nbehaviours, though more participants mentioned this as\nan issue for providing PA advice. While idiosyncratic, the\ngoals of 'not wanting to be a broken record' (ID5, male,\n41, urban) and 'wanting to go home in time for dinner'\n(ID1, male, 43, rural) highlight that GPs' personal goals\ncan also potentially interfere with providing PA advice in\nthe consultation.\nGoal facilitation\nTable 2 shows that eleven of twelve participants men-\ntioned goal-directed behaviours perceived to facilitate\nproviding PA advice and prescribing to reduce BP in a con-\nsultation. Most coded goal facilitation was elicited beyond\ncontrol belief related questions (71% of codes for BP pre-\nscribing and 79% of codes for PA advice). The focal behav-\niours were mentioned by participants as facilitating each\nother to a certain extent: 'it's difficult to just look at BP\nwithout looking at physical activity, these sorts of things\n[happen] at the same time' (ID3, female, 29, rural). Pro-\nviding PA advice was perceived to be facilitated by discuss-\ning other lifestyle issues (particularly, 'weight discussions'\nwas mentioned by seven of 11 GPs) and addressing diabe-\ntes-related risks for future health. Prescribing to reduce BP\nwas perceived to be mainly facilitated by performing\nongoing consultation goal-directed behaviours (e.g.,\nclearly structuring the consultation, trying to reach QOF\ntargets, negotiating with the patient).\nProspective goal facilitation\nWhile this study focused on facilitating goal-directed\nbehaviours within a specific consultation, participants\nalso described goal-directed behaviours that prospectively\nfacilitated performance of the focal behaviours. Nine of\ntwelve GPs mentioned goal-directed behaviours that they\nperformed over many consultations that eventually facili-\ntated prescribing to reduce BP: building rapport, establish-\ning shared or GP-led nature of consultation, giving\nopportunity to try lifestyle options first, recommending a\nhome BP monitor, tailoring guidelines, using staged pre-\nscription of different drugs, providing written informa-\ntion, GP writing self reminders, inviting patients who are\nnot at maximum tolerated dosage in for a review, and tak-\ning multiple BP readings. For providing physical activity\nadvice, fewer GPs (four of twelve) mentioned compara-\nTable 1: Goal-directed behaviours perceived to interfere with focal behaviours during a consultation\nPhysical activity advice (N = 10 GPs) Blood pressure prescribing (N = 7 GPs)\nTheme Goal-directed behaviours Theme Goal-directed behaviours\nConsultation\n(n = 8)\n- fitting the patient agenda Consultation\n(n = 4)\n- capturing other GP contract information\n- focusing on GP contract-specific goals - dealing with pressing issues\n- treating acute illness - pursuing the contract BP targets\n- other clinical aspects (general) - too much else going on in the consultation\nDiabetes (n = 4) - addressing medication - treating acute illness\n- covering blood pressure and cholesterol Diabetes (n = 2) - addressing cholesterol\n- giving instruction for diabetic control - multiple drugs to prescribe\n- getting HbA1c down - talking about glycemic control\n- looking at blood sugar GP\/patient relationship\n(n = 3)\n- providing patient choice\nGP factors (n = 2) - not wanting to be a broken record - respecting patient preference\n- wanting to go homePage 6 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77tively less goal-directed behaviours that prospectively\nfacilitated providing PA advice. These included empower-\ning the patient, e.g., 'really empowering the patient them-\nselves to take a bit more responsibility for their own\nhealth and condition' (ID4, female, 34, rural), making\nanother appointment with the GP, and making an\nappointment with the nurse.\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nThis study used TPB-based constructs supplemented by a\nmultiple goals approach to investigate control beliefs and\nthe facilitating and interfering goal-directed behaviours\nthat GPs perceived as affecting their performance of two\nevidence-based behaviours in a diabetes consultation.\nResults showed that indeed GPs perceived other goal-\ndirected behaviours as interfering with and facilitating\nperforming the focal evidence-based behaviours, though\nto a different extent between behaviours. The majority of\nperceived goal facilitation and interference was elicited\nbeyond the standard control belief elicitation. Results\nwere in line with quantitative research conducted with\nother populations that found that the interfering [18-\n20,43] and facilitating (Presseau J, Sniehotta FF, Francis JJ,\nGebhardt WA: With a little help from my goals: Integrat-\ning intergoal facilitation with the theory of planned\nbehaviour to predict physical activity, Submitted) [17]\neffect of other goal pursuits were related to the perform-\nance of a particular behaviour. This study contributes to\nthis research by providing qualitative evidence that GPs\nperceive that goals they pursue when managing diabetes\ninterfere with and facilitate their performance of evidence-\nbased behaviours.

In doing so, this study suggests promising\nlines of development of behavioural theory to reflect phy-\nsicians' perceived competing demands in clinical practice.\nBehavioural approaches to implementation research may\nbenefit from further investigation of the perceived influ-\nences of pursuing multiple goals over and above inten-\ntions and PBC.\nContent of perceived goal interference and facilitation \nbetween focal behaviours\nWhile similar types of goal-directed behaviours were per-\nceived to interfere with both focal behaviours (though\nmore frequently for PA advice), BP prescribing was con-\nsistently described as strongly intended whereas intention\nto provide PA advice varied between GPs. This suggests an\nunderlying (and perhaps not surprising) potential differ-\nence in relative priority between the two focal behaviours\nfor some GPs. The implication is that when goals com-\npete, the less prioritised goal-directed behaviours may be\nsubject to a greater influence by other interfering goal-\ndirected behaviours.\nAs opposed to goal interference, as many participants\ndescribed goal-directed behaviours that facilitate giving\nPA advice as prescribing to reduce BP. Though some goal-\ndirected behaviours were perceived to facilitate both focal\nbehaviours (including each other), a key content-related\ndifference distinguishes the two: one-half described 'con-\nsultation' goal-directed behaviours as facilitating BP pre-\nscribing (compared to one GP for PA advice), whereas\neight described other 'lifestyle' goal-directed behaviours as\nfacilitating giving PA advice (compared to three GPs for\nBP prescribing). Performing 'consultation' goal-directed\nbehaviours may effectively provide a supportive context\nfor performing the highly intended behaviour. Con-\nversely, the behaviour with more variable levels of inten-\ntion was not described as being facilitated by such\nconsultation goal-directed behaviours, but rather by the\ncluster of other similar lifestyle goal-directed behaviours.\nThese differences between focal behaviours again suggest\nan underlying difference in relative priority. When time is\nlimited, we question whether facilitating similar (e.g.,\nother lifestyle) goal-directed behaviours would increase\nthe likelihood of a focal behaviour being performed,\nbecause that facilitating effect would depend on those\nsimilar behaviours also being performed. However, facili-\ntating goal-directed behaviours at the consultation level\nmay provide a context that favours the facilitated focal\nbehaviour despite time limitations. Certain types of goal-\ndirected behaviours may therefore be more useful for pro-\nmoting the performance of a focal evidence-based behav-\niour.\nGoal facilitation and interference along a temporal \ndimension\nDespite the interviews focusing on perceived intergoal\nrelations within a single consultation, the longitudinal\nand chronic nature of diabetes care was often reflected in\nGPs' responses when discussing facilitating goal-directed\nbehaviours. This suggests that goal facilitation may oper-\nate beyond the single consultation and that pursuing such\ngoals over a series of consultations eventually facilitates\nperforming the focal behaviour (i.e., prospective facilita-\ntion). While this lead-up prospective facilitation is remi-\nniscent of Bandura's 'proximal subgoals' [44] and\nBagozzi's 'instrumental acts' [45], the latter concepts are\nframed within a perspective that is explicitly focused on a\nsingle behaviour. Conversely, the concept of prospective\ngoal facilitation takes a systems-based perspective. The\nsystem can be considered as made up of multiple goal-\ndirected and valued behaviours that are performed in and\nof themselves, rather than expressly to facilitate a particu-\nlar behaviour. This temporal perspective of prospective\ngoal facilitation may help to account for the longitudinal\naspects of general practice often recognised as a main\nadvantage, such as continuity of care [46]. It also presents\nwith the possibility of developing strategies for promoting\nfacilitation based on planning (e.g., facilitation planning)\nthat extend over many consultations.\nWhile an equivalent temporal dimension for goal interfer-\nence was not overtly described by GPs, the perceived inter-\nfering relationship between goal-directed behaviours can\nnevertheless be considered along a temporal continuum.\nFor instance, some identified interfering goal-directed\nbehaviours can be considered as one-offs, representing a\nmore transient form of interference confined to a single\nconsultation (e.g., treating an acute illness, dealing with\npressing issues). Other goal-directed behaviours pre-\nsented a more enduring interference because they are\npotentially performed frequently and recurrently over\ntime (e.g., fitting in the patient agenda, capturing other\ninformation for the GP contract). The advantage of distin-\nguishing this temporal dimension lies in the possibility\nthat separate strategies may exist for dealing with such per-\nceived interfering goals. Transient interference can be\ndealt with using deferral strategies [47], whereas enduring\ninterference is by definition longitudinal in nature and\nthus continuous deferral would likely be detrimental.\nEnduringly interfering goal pursuits may also be an indi-\ncation of the relative priority of a goal-directed behaviour;\nif many goals interfere over a long period of time with per-\nforming a particular behaviour, the latter may not be seen\nas important or useful. Enduring interference may be par-\nticularly problematic for optimal performance of evi-\ndence-based behaviours, and future research could\nspecifically identify whether duration of perceived inter-\nference affects performance of particular focal clinicalPage 8 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77behaviours. That said, identifying and promoting facilitat-\ning goal-directed behaviours may circumvent these more\nenduring perceived interfering goal-directed behaviours,\nas could re-evaluating, modifying or disengaging from a\nparticularly interfering goal [47].\nRelative priority between goal-directed behaviours\nThe relative priority between the focal behaviours was an\nunderlying finding in this study. Despite more barriers\nexpressed for prescribing to reduce BP, it was also consist-\nently described as strongly intended whereas intention to\ngive PA advice was variable. Differences in relative priority\nare not surprising because PA advice can often also be pro-\nvided by other primary care staff (e.g., practice nurse),\nwhereas prescribing to reduce BP is primarily the GP's role\n(though increasing dosage can be nurse-led). While some\nGPs may indeed prioritise diagnosing and treating diabe-\ntes, the variation in described strength of intention to give\nPA advice suggests that this is not true of all GPs. Future\nresearch should investigate whether perceptions about\nprofessional role influence the priority of a particular evi-\ndence-based clinical behaviour relative to other goal-\ndirected behaviours performed in a consultation.\nIn a null-sum situation of limited time something must\ngive way, and this is likely determined by the perceived\npriority of each goal-directed behaviour. However, appli-\ncations of single behaviour models to health professional\nbehaviour [5,8] inherently do not consider this. A GP may\nintend to address cholesterol and BP with a patient, and\ndefer addressing BP to the next consultation in order to be\nable to pursue both. However, this still raises the question\nof which behaviour should take precedence and which\nshould be deferred. This may be less of an issue when fol-\nlow-up consultations or extra time slots [48] are readily\navailable. However, the follow-up consultation also\npresents with another set of goal-directed behaviours\nthemselves potentially interfering with the now deferred\nbehaviour. Whether or not the deferred behaviour's prior-\nity has changed may again be a function of what other\ngoal-directed behaviours the GP performs in the follow-\nup consultation. The effectiveness of strategies for dealing\nwith interference and promoting facilitation may also\nultimately depend on which goal-directed behaviours are\nprioritised at any given time. Given that BP prescribing for\npeople with diabetes is currently related to a GP contract-\nremunerated target in the UK, while PA advice is not\nseems a likely reason for differences in relative priority.\nIndeed, relative priority is likely to be influenced by a\nnumber of behavioural, normative, and control beliefs,\nand future research focusing on influences of priority\nseems justified.\nComparing control beliefs and perceived intergoal \nrelationships\nControl beliefs and perceived intergoal relationships have\nsimilarities; indeed both reflected similar themes in this\nstudy. In theory, one would expect intergoal conflict and\nfacilitation to be reflected in perceptions of perceived con-\ntrol. Regardless of whether they represent a more detailed\nfacet of control beliefs or are independent constructs,\nquestions and prompts of goal facilitation and interfer-\nence elicit content that might otherwise be missed in\nstandard belief elicitation studies. Indeed, while some of\nthe coded perceived intergoal relationships emerged fol-\nlowing control belief elicitation, the vast majority of\ncoded perceived goal facilitation and interference (71% to\n92% of codes) was elicited using questions and prompts\nfor these constructs or when discussing intention. In itself,\nthis argues that it may be important to further consider\nthe context within which focal clinical behaviours are per-\nformed, including competing goal-directed behaviours.\nFurther conceptual and empirical factors can also attest to\ntheir distinctiveness. Conceptually, control beliefs 'deal\nwith the presence or absence of requisite resources and\nopportunities' [4]. Conversely, goal-directed behaviours\ncompete for those resources and opportunities, are per-\nformed independently for their own sake, and are deter-\nmined by their own set of beliefs, perceptions, and\nintentions. Perceived intergoal facilitation and interfer-\nence are constructs that partly represent sources of\nresource competition, and thus may influence control\nbeliefs about a particular goal-directed behaviour. For\ninstance, 'focusing on GP contract goals' was described as\na goal-directed behaviour that interfered with giving PA\nadvice. Pursuing these perceived interfering contract goals\nmay then lead the GP to perceive a time constraint (i.e., a\ncontrol belief). Perceived intergoal relationships might\nalso influence other control-related beliefs. For instance,\n'engaging the patient' and 'negotiating with the patient'\nwere goal-directed behaviours described as facilitating\nprescribing to reduce BP, and their pursuit may influence\ncontrol beliefs described as making it easier to prescribe,\nsuch as 'knowing the patient'. These examples suggest that\nperceived intergoal relationships may contribute towards\ncontrol beliefs about a particular goal-directed behaviour,\nbut are conceptually separate.\nThat said, despite our focus on control beliefs, perceived\nintergoal relationships may also inform other types of\nbeliefs. For instance, the perceived facilitating effect of\n'talking about weight' might affect a behavioural belief\nthat it is good practice to talk about exercise, and the per-\nceived interference of 'pursuing other GP contract targets'\nmight affect normative beliefs about whether colleagues\nthink the GP should prescribe. Furthermore, these per-\nceived intergoal relationships may influence a behaviourPage 9 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77without necessarily informing specific beliefs about the\nbehaviour, leading to a independent influence on behav-\niour. While these effects require quantitative substantia-\ntion in a clinical sample, perceived intergoal facilitation\nhas been shown to be partially mediated by the TPB and\nalso additionally independently predict behaviour in a\nnon-clinical population [Presseau J, Sniehotta FF, Francis\nJJ, Gebhardt WA: With a little help from my goals: Inte-\ngrating intergoal facilitation with the theory of planned\nbehaviour to predict physical activity, Submitted]. This\nfurther attests to the distinction between control factors\nand perceived intergoal relationships.\nImplications for implementation science\nImplementation science is concerned with understanding\nand promoting the application of research into practice,\nwhich involves the behaviour of health professionals.\nTheory-based models of behaviour allow us to build a\ncumulative science to understand the factors that are per-\nceived to relate to performing according to the standards\nset by current evidence. Investigations of extensions to\nsuch models of behaviour allow us to maintain their\nfoundations while attempting to address identified short-\ncomings. This qualitative study contributes hypothesis-\ngenerating results towards the further development of\nbehavioural theory to better understand such variations in\nevidence-based health professional behaviour. This study\nsuggests that what GPs do and pursue during a consulta-\ntion are perceived to influence each other in a helpful or\nhindering way. Rather than solely focusing on a single\ninvestigator-identified behaviour, busy time-constrained\nconsultations may be more appropriately conceptualised\nby also explicitly considering the perceived influence of\nGPs' other goal-directed behaviours. Gaps between\nresearch evidence and the performance of a particular\nclinical behaviour might be addressed by focusing atten-\ntion upon what else the GP wants to do and does during\nthe consultation, and how they relate to the focal behav-\niour. In some instances, many of the other goal-directed\nbehaviours in the consultation are perceived to interfere\nwith its performance. For others, the extent of interference\nis lesser (perhaps due to a higher relative priority), though\nbehaviour may still be marred by a number of identified\ncontrol beliefs. The value of a multiple goal-directed\nbehaviour approach to implementation science may be as\na means of: assessing how higher-level policy driven goals\nsuch as 'provide patient centred care' and 'provide evi-\ndence-based care' are pursued (i.e., goal-directed behav-\niours) and how these pursuits may facilitate or interfere\nwith one another; identifying and promoting sustainable\nclinical goal pursuits that facilitate particular evidence-\nbased behaviours; and identifying and addressing com-\npeting goal pursuits that interfere with these evidence-\nbased behaviours.\nFor instance, eliciting the multiple goal-directed behav-\niours that professionals perform and assessing their per-\nceived interfering and facilitating influence on a focal\nbehaviour may raise the awareness and salience of other-\nwise habitually performed behaviours. This could provide\nthe opportunity to target interfering goal relations (that\nmay or may not be related to control belief-related barri-\ners). Once this interference is identified, and if appropri-\nate, strategies can be adopted to minimise its effects. In\nthis study GPs reported that respecting patient choice\ninterfered with prescribing to reduce BP (Table 1), and\nthat whether the patient 'understands and is informed'\nmade it easier to prescribe (Additional File 2). They also\nperceived that performing the goal-directed behaviour of\n'educating patients' facilitated prescribing to reduce BP\n(Table 2). Thus, a strategy of educating patients may both\nfacilitate performance of the target behaviour and pro-\nmote the factors seen as making it easier to prescribe to\nreduce BP, minimising the potential influence of the inter-\nfering goal. Promoting such facilitating sequences of goal-\ndirected behaviours uses the existing structure of goal pur-\nsuit, rather than necessarily introducing new goal-directed\nbehaviours. This could involve prospective facilitation\nwhereby facilitating goal-directed behaviours can be iden-\ntified and prospectively planned to be performed over\ntime, which may provide a theoretically-informed opera-\ntionalisation of continuity of care.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study used an explicit and a priori-specified theory-\nbased methodology as a foundation for thematic analysis.\nThis approach is a strength of this study because it allowed\nus to integrate knowledge and evidence from existing the-\nories to extend current ones, rather than (re)inventing a\nnew theory [49]. While further quantitative evidence is\nneeded to substantiate the qualitative findings in this\nstudy, by moving beyond single behaviours studied in iso-\nlation, this study attempted to bring some clarity to the\ncomplexity of clinical practice. The theory-based methods\nsupport the results in contributing to building a cumula-\ntive evidence base of the implementation of health profes-\nsional behaviour. Methodologically, the double coding\nand inter-rater reliability assessment are also a strength.\nWhile this study is limited by a small sample size, this is\nmitigated by the purposive heterogeneity sampling strat-\negy used to explore the breadth of responses. It became\nevident in the later interviews that the research questions\nhad been sufficiently answered, i.e., that GPs did perceive\ntheir goal-directed behaviours as facilitating and influenc-\ning performing the two focal behaviours. Though the\nstudy was not designed to necessarily achieve data satura-\ntion, evidence from the literature suggesting that a sample\nsize of 12 can provide as much information as a much\nlarger sample in qualitative studies [37].Page 10 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:77 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/77Unanswered Questions\nWhile the study design precludes us from drawing conclu-\nsions about whether perceived intergoal relationships\nmight augment the TPB, this study nevertheless allows us\nto generate hypotheses, particularly when also consider-\ning research in non-clinical populations. Future investiga-\ntions could test hypotheses regarding whether perceived\nintergoal relationships build independently on TPB con-\nstructs, or moderate the relationship between clinicians'\nintentions and their behaviour. Whether promoting facil-\nitating goal pursuits and reducing the effect of interfering\ngoals might affect performance of a focal behaviour also\nremains an open question. Another unanswered question\ninvolves GPs' reports of high intention to prescribe to\nreduce BP, but expressing conditions related to the situa-\ntional demands of the consultation that affect that high\nintention; future research should consider the implica-\ntions of these 'conditionalities'. Finally, it seems plausible\nto have a strong intention towards many behaviours while\nstill prioritising some over others, as priority implies\nurgency. Future investigations distinguishing 'priority'\nfrom alternative comparative measures, such as intention-\nchoice [11] or relative intention (e.g., rank or difference\nbetween intention to perform multiple goal-directed\nbehaviours) may contribute to understanding the effect\nthat multiple goal-directed behaviours have on perform-\ning a focal behaviour.\nSummary\nGPs perceive their other goal-directed behaviours as influ-\nencing the performance of particular focal behaviours.\nThis hypothesis-generating result suggests that behav-\nioural approaches to knowledge translation may benefit\nfrom further investigation of whether multiple goal-\ndirected behaviour approaches can predict and explain\nvariation in health professional behaviour beyond single-\nbehaviour models.\nEthical approval\nEthical approval for this study was obtained by the North\nof Scotland Research Ethics Committee.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJP, FFS, JJF and NCC conceived and designed the study.
