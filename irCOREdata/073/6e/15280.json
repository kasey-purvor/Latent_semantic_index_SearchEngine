The Ars \nOppositorum is a work of prose philosophy in Latin which offers a very \nunusual version of the Aristotelian square of opposites: it is a discussion of \nhow opposites can be used to produce knowledge.\n1\n By contrast, the D\u00e9lie is \na collection of love lyric influenced by Petrarchism. Despite these \ndifferences of genre, as I have shown elsewhere, the D\u00e9lie and the Ars share \nan interest in the function of various kinds of difference both within and \nbetween pairs of opposite terms;\n \nin particular, both texts undermine \nantithetical difference by confusing it with other kinds of difference, thus \n                                                 \n1\n On the Ars Oppositorum, see Maurice de Gandillac, \u2018L\u2019Art bovilien des oppos\u00e9s\u2019, in Charles de Bovelles \nen son cinqui\u00e8me centenaire 1479-1979: Actes du colloque international tenu \u00e0 Noyon les 14-15-16 \nseptembre 1979, ed. by Jean-Claude Margolin (Paris: Guy Tr\u00e9daniel, \u00c9ditions de la Maisnie, 1982), pp. \n157-70; Joseph M.

Both writers explore the role of \nthe human subject in establishing difference, and suggest that human \ncognition may be very powerful, so that it even seems to usurp the function \nof natural causality. However, ultimately Sc\u00e8ve and Bovelles diverge in their \nassessment of the value of difference, both in general and for the human \nsubject in particular. I shall focus in this essay upon Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s \u2018jealous sun\u2019 \ndizains in which, I have argued elsewhere, the beloved lady alters relations \nof difference within the cosmos.\n3\n \nMy aim in reading a poetic text alongside a theoretical one is not to \nconstruct a univocal account of Renaissance conceptions of difference, or to \n                                                 \n2\n See my article \u2018Opposites and Identities: Maurice Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s D\u00e9lie and Charles de Bovelles\u2019s Ars \nOppositorum\u2019.

Other discussions of Sc\u00e8ve in the context of Bovelles\u2019s \nthought are Jacqueline Risset, L\u2019Anagramme du d\u00e9sir: Sur la D\u00e9lie de Maurice Sc\u00e8ve (Paris, Fourbis, \n1995), pp. 91-100; Doranne Fenoaltea, \u201cSi haulte Architecture\u201d: The Design of Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s D\u00e9lie (Kentucky: \nFrench Forum, 1982), pp. 84-92. \n3\n \u2018Opposites and Identities\u2019. \n 3 \nconsider philosophy as a source for poetry;\n4\n instead, I will locate not only \nthe similarities but also the divergences between the D\u00e9lie and the Ars. \nIndeed the generic differences between the two texts mean that they may \nhave provided contrasting conceptual possibilities: thus they illuminate \ndifferent possible ways of thinking about opposition and sameness in early \nsixteenth-century France. Some differences arise from the simple fact that, \nwhile love lyric explores particular terms which it often places in opposition \nto one another, the Ars Oppositorum sets out to analyse the principle of \nopposition. More specifically for the concerns of this essay, Bovelles, in \ncommon with much sixteenth-century prose philosophy, tends to refer to \n\u2018man\u2019 \u0154 or the human intellectus (understanding \/ perception) \u0154 in the \nabstract singular; by contrast, love lyric depicts both the subjective \nexperience of a ie and also the desired tu or elle; as I will discuss, this \ndivergence between the Ars and the D\u00e9lie is central to their contrasting \nperceptions of difference in the human subject. \n \n \n                                                 \n4\n Cf Hans Staub\u2019s reading of the D\u00e9lie in the context of the thought of Nicholas of Cusa, an important \ninfluence upon Bovelles: Le Curieux D\u00e9sir: Sc\u00e8ve et Peletier du Mans, po\u00e8tes de la connaissance (Geneva: \nDroz, 1967). \n 4 \ni) Cognition and Causality: The Intellectus And Nature In The Ars \nOppositorum \n \nBoth Sc\u00e8ve and Bovelles are deeply interested in the role of the human in \nrelation to opposition. Two key questions emerge in relation to this. Firstly, \nwhat role does human perception or understanding play in opposition? That \nis, what effects does the human gaze or the human mind exert upon \nopposition? And, secondly, how are human subjects affected by opposition? \nIn other words, are human beings subject to opposition?  \n Bovelles states in his first chapter that oppositions can stem either \nfrom nature or reason: his first subheading states (using a spatial image \ntypical of Bovelles\u2019s writing) that \u2018we call opposites things placed facing \neach other, turned towards one another, separated by the distance of either a \nnatural or a rational line\u2019.5 Opposites include, for Bovelles, all things \nplaced in relation to one another \u2018either by nature or by \nunderstanding\/perception (the intellectus)\u2019 (p. 36). Oppositions of substance \n(substantia) and \/ or the thing (res) stem from nature, whereas oppositions of \n                                                 \n5\n \u2018Opposita dicuntur contra se posita, in alterutrum conversa, interstite aut naturali aut rationali dyametro \ndistantia\u2019: ed. by Pierre Magnard, (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1984), p. 36. I refer throughout to \nMagnard\u2019s edition; translations into English are my own, although I have consulted Magnard\u2019s French \ntranslation. All italics are my own. \n 5 \nreasoning (ratio) stem from the intellectus.\n6\n Bovelles\u2019s first chapter \nemphasises at some length that the intellectus cannot alter the nature or \nsubstance of things \u0154 it cannot divide them or put them together; the \nintellectus cannot \u2018create\u2019 or \u2018engender\u2019 anything. Instead the human \nintellectus adds rationes (\u2018reasonings\u2019) to things, producing conceptions \nwhich stem from the mind rather than simply from nature.\n7\n Therefore, the \nprocess of human reasoning embedded in Bovelles\u2019s square of opposites \u0154 \nwhile described as creative\n8\n \u0154 seems to be one of cognition rather than \ngenuine creation.  \n                                                 \n6\n Bovelles also discusses the intellectus in the Liber de Intellectu and the De Sapiente in particular (both \npublished together with the Ars in 1511). I restrict myself here to the Ars Oppositorum, where the \nintellectus is discussed in its relation to opposition.  \n7\n \u2018For the intellectus cannot change the nature or substance of things, nor can it divide them or put them \ntogether \u2026 the intellectus creates nothing and engenders nothing \u2026 The intellectus has, however, although \nsterile and infertile as far as substance is concerned, some force and fertility of its own, by which it can be \ncalled creator of rationes (reasonings); it adds, you see, to the things themselves its own rationes, which it \nderives, contains and grasps. The conception which is in the human intellectus is the fruit and offspring of \nthe human intellectus and the mind\u2019s own work, not the work of nature alone\u2019: \u2018Nam intellectus rerum \nnaturam et substantiam immutare non potest, neque enim illas dividit aut componit \u2026 intellectus \u2026 nil \ncreat gignitque nichil \u2026 Habet tamen intellectus licet substantia sterilis atque infecundus propriam aliquam \nvim et fecunditatem, qua rationum opifex dicitur; proprias quippe rebus ipsis addit rationes, illas haurit, \ncontinet et complectitur. Is enim conceptus qui humano inest intellectui fecunditas est et partus humani \nintellectus ac peculiare mentis opus, non opus simplicis nature\u2019 (pp. 44-6). \n8\n It produces \u2018a productive development of discourse\u2019: \u2018fecunda quedam orationis propagatio\u2019 (p. 32). \n 6 \nHowever, later in the Ars (especially in chapters 4 and 7), Bovelles \nsuggests that opposites are not natural. Although Bovelles stated in the first \nchapter that opposites can be \u2018rational\u2019 or natural, in the fourth chapter he \nsays that in nature all things are in relations of identity to themselves rather \nthan relations of opposition to other things; indeed the fourth chapter is \nentitled \u2018That all things have been made by nature in identity, and none in \nopposition\u2019.9 Furthermore, Bovelles tends to write as if the production of \noppositions might even affect nature. Whereas things in nature are \u2018in their \nown place\u2019 and never move from it, relations of opposition force things into \nplaces which are not their own (like earth into the place of fire and vice \nversa), and put different things into the same place (pp. 58-60).  \nChapter 7 aligns opposition with the intellectus by contradistinction to \nnature: all oppositions result from the intellectus rather than from nature, and \n\u2018the intellect is the opposition of the entirety of nature\u2019.10 The intellectus is \npresented as a domain in which all things are opposed, by contrast with the \n                                                 \n9\n \u2018Quod omnia a natura in identitate sint facta, in oppositione nulla\u2019 (p. 58). \n10\n \u2018Si a natura nulla est oppositio, superest ut omnis oppositio sit ab intellectu\u2019 (heading of first subsection, \np. 80); \u2018intellectus est totius nature oppositio, natura vero omnium identitas\u2019 (heading of second subsection, \np. 80). \n 7 \ndomain of nature in which all things are separated and identical.\n11\n The \nintellectus is a \u2018judge\u2019 (iudex) of all things and of their oppositions and \ndifferences. Moreover, the domains of the intellectus and nature are not \nentirely independent. The judging by the intellectus is necessary to nature.\n12\n \nThe intellectus is represented as a sun (p. 88) or a light which illuminates \nnature (p. 84);\n13\n without this \u2018light\u2019, nature would be in a state of \u2018chaos\u2019, \n\u2018confusion\u2019 and \u2018mixity\u2019 (p. 84).14 The introduction by the intellectus of \nopposition thus seems to affect nature.  \n                                                 \n11\n See in particular the subsection heading \u2018Omnia in mundo sunt separate et eadem, coniuncta vero sunt, et \nopposite in intellectu\u2019 (p. 82) \n12\n See also Bovelles\u2019s De Sapiente, as well as Pierre Magnard\u2019s \u2018L\u2019Id\u00e9al du sage dans le De Sapiente de \nCharles de Bovelles\u2019, in Charles de Bovelles en son cinqui\u00e8me centenaire 1479-1979: Actes du colloque \ninternational tenu \u00e0 Noyon les 14-15-16 septembre 1979, ed. by Jean-Claude Margolin (Paris: Guy \nTr\u00e9daniel, \u00c9ditions de la Maisnie, 1982), pp. 101-8. \n13\n On solar imagery in Bovelles\u2019s De Sapiente, see Cesare Vasoli, \u2018Th\u00e8mes solaires du De Sapiente\u2019, in \nCharles de Bovelles en son cinqui\u00e8me centenaire 1479-1979: Actes du colloque international tenu \u00e0 Noyon \nles 14-15-16 septembre 1979, ed. by Jean-Claude Margolin (Paris: Guy Tr\u00e9daniel, \u00c9ditions de la Maisnie, \n1982), pp. 109-28. \n14\n Bovelles does not explain clearly how this depiction of nature as confusion fits with his representation of \nopposition as a mixing of things which is be contrasted with the separation or non-mixing of things in \nnature: see in particular, pp. 80-1. Bovelles\u2019s spatial metaphors are often deeply complex. The notion of a \nlight dividing Chaos recalls God but Bovelles has earlier made it clear that he does not mean the divine \nintellectus, which in any case \u2018is nature itself\u2019 (p. 45).  \n 8 \nFurthermore, although Bovelles repeatedly says that opposition is \nimpossible in nature and exists only in the intellectus, the intellectus\u2019s \nopposition of things is repeatedly presented as if it had a strong and violent \neffect upon nature. Both chapters 4 and 7 emphasise that opposition is a \nviolence \u0154 or a force (vis) \u0154 inflicted upon things, and that it acts against \nnature (pp. 58-60, 80-2). The terms violentum \/ violenta and contra naturam \n\/ nature contraria are repeated. Nature does not permit opposition, and does \nnot permit earth and fire to swap places, and yet in some sense the intellectus \ndoes bring things into places other than their natural ones, as if it could \nreorder space and the cosmic hierarchy: \u2018with just as much rest and peace as \nfire remains high, with this much immobility and peace earth is at rest \nimmobile below. And with as much quarrel and difficulty fire is maintained \nbelow, as with force and discord the earth is at rest above. Identity, \ntherefore, and the peace of both elements, is that fire be high and earth be \nlow. On the other hand, the quarrel and discord of both is that fire be placed \nand positioned below and earth above.\u201915  \n                                                 \n15\n \u2018quanta quiete et pace ignis sursum immobilis perseverat, tanta immobilitate et pace terra deorsum \nquiescit immobilis. Et quanta lite atque difficultate ignis continetur in immo, tanta vi et discordia terra \nquiescit in summo. Identitas igitur est et utriusque pax elementi: ignem esse in summon et terram in immo. \nUtriusque vero lis et discordia ignem in immo et terram in summo sisti et collocari\u2019 (p. 58). \n 9 \nThere is a strong sense of the power exerted by the human intellectus \nupon the world: Bovelles tends to write as if cognition really could affect \nnature, as if cognition could almost be causality. Perhaps one might even \nread his emphasis that the intellectus \u2018creates nothing and engenders \nnothing\u2019 as betraying doubts concerning the absolute separation of cognition \nand causality.\n16\n There is a rather uncertain relation between cognition and \nchange, between the intellectus and nature; there is a sense that cognition \nand creativity might overlap in function.  \n \n \nii) Cognition And Causality: The Lady\u2019s Gaze And The Je In The D\u00e9lie \n \nBovelles presents human understanding or perception (the intellectus) as a \nlight which violently introduces difference into the world, which puts things \ninto unnatural places and different things into the same place, and which \nreverses the cosmic hierarchy. This provides some startling comparisons and \ncontrasts with Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s \u2018jealous sun\u2019 dizains. I have argued in a previous \narticle that Sc\u00e8ve represents his lady as a bright light who, through her \n                                                 \n16\n In the second \u2018circle\u2019 of Le F\u00e8vre de La Boderie\u2019s Encyclie, the teacher-Muse corrects the secr\u00e9taire\u2019s \nmistake in confusing cognition and natural change, and lists the differences between them.  \n 10 \nbrightness, first, introduces difference into the sun, making it different from \nitself, and, secondly, alters the relations of difference between the day and \nnight, so that both seem to co-exist in the same place, or to occupy the place \nof the other.\n17\n Importantly for my comparison with Bovelles\u2019s intellectus-\nlight, it is the lady\u2019s status as light which brings about this introduction and \nmodification of difference, and which thus alters nature. Indeed, although \nthe \u2018jealous sun\u2019 topos and related images are common in Petrarch\u2019s poetry \nand in sixteenth-century French love lyric, the D\u00e9lie places a particular \nemphasis upon light in this context, whereas, for example, Du Bellay \u0154 in his \nOlive, published five years after the D\u00e9lie \u0154 evokes the heat of the sun and \nits benefits for nature.\n18\n  \nFurthermore, the light of the lady can also be thought of as a site of \nperception or cognition. It may be her eyes which are suns: they are \u2018deux \nSoleils\u2019 (D269).19 Indeed there is a strong sense of similarity between the \neye and the sun both within the D\u00e9lie and in other contemporary texts.

The eye was widely believed to cast light during the \nprocess of vision.\n20\n In Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialoghi d\u2019amore, the \u2018grand br\u00e9viaire \ndu platonisme lyonnais\u2019 and an important intertext for the D\u00e9lie,21 Philon \nexplains at length that both the eye and the sun both illuminate and see (as \ndo the human intellect and the divine intellect): \n \nComme l\u2019entendement humain est compar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intellect divin, pource que l\u2019un et l\u2019autre \nvoid et illumine, et comme l\u2019\u0153il est compar\u00e9 au Soleil, \u00e0 voir et illuminer egalement, et \naussi comme l\u2019\u0153il se compare \u00e0 l\u2019entendement humain en deux choses (asavoir, illuminer \net voir): aussi le Soleil, pource qu\u2019il void et illumine les choses, ressemble le divin \nintellect.\n22\n  \n \n                                                 \n20\n See David C.

Moreover, the human \ngaze of the je is much less empowered than that of the lady. Like the sun,\n25\n \n                                                 \n23\n Les Trois Livres des meteores (Paris: J.

She obscures not only his gaze but also his \ncognition in the form of pens\u00e9e, sens, and congnoissance:\n27\n \n \nCe bas Soleil, qui au plus hault fait honte, \nNous a daingn\u00e9 de sa rare lumiere, \nQuand sa blancheur, qui l\u2019yvoire surmonte, \nA esclercy le brouillas de Fourviere: \nEt s\u2019arrestant l\u2019une, et l\u2019aultre riviere, \nSi grand\u2019 clart\u00e9 s\u2019est icy demonstr\u00e9e, \nQue quand mes yeulx l\u2019ont soubdain rencontr\u00e9e, \nIlz m\u2019ont perdu au bien, qui seul me nuict. \n   Car son cler iour serenant la Contr\u00e9e,  \nEn ma pens\u00e9e a mys l\u2019obscure nuit (D128) \n                                                 \n26\n Other contemporary poets also imply that the je and the sun are similarly challenged by their encounter \nwith the lady, but often suggest that the je survives his encounter with the lady where the sun failed to do \nso: see, for example, sonnet IX of Jacques Peletier Du Mans\u2019s Amour des Amours, ed. by Jean-Charles \nMonferran (Paris: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Textes Fran\u00e7ais Modernes, 1996), pp. 29-30; sonnet XI of the Premier Livre \ndes Sonnets pour H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, in Ronsard\u2019s Amours, ed. by Fran\u00e7oise Joukovsky (Paris: Gallimard, 1974), \np. 286. \n27\n See also D7, D51, D92, D269, D354 \n 14 \n \nAu recevoir l\u2019aigu de tes esclairs  \nTu m\u2019offuscas et sens, et congnoissance (D80) \n \nThus, while one \u2018human\u2019 light or gaze exerts an effect upon nature, another \nsite of human perception \u0154 the je \u0154 has his light or gaze undermined by the \nsame gaze which affects the natural world.\n28\n \n \n \niii) Difference And The Human Subject In The D\u00e9lie  \n \nFurthermore, the je also suffers a sort of \u2018confusion\u2019 or \u2018mixing\u2019 or \n\u2018division\u2019. Images of melting and burning are familiar from other Petrarchist \npoetry but Sc\u00e8ve is often particularly insistent upon developing these images \nof self-disintegration. For example, in D373, his eye dissolves and melts into \ntears, which become a river which freezes him and in so doing \u0154 somewhat \n                                                 \n28\n Other implications of this are discussed in my \u2018The Cosmic, the Human, and the Divine: The Role of \nPoetic Images in Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas\u2019s Sepmaine and Maurice Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s D\u00e9lie\u2019 (unpublished \ndoctoral thesis, University of Cambridge, 2005), Part II, and my book under preparation, Cosmos and \nImage in the French Renaissance. \n 15 \nparadoxically \u0154 \u2018me confond\u2019, that is to say, \u2018mixes\u2019 and metamorphoses \nhim.\n29\n \n \nA son aspect mon \u0153il reveremment \nS\u2019incline bas, tant le C\u0153ur la revere, \nEt l\u2019ayme, et craint trop perseveramment \nEn sa rigueur benignement severe. \n   Car en l\u2019ardeur si fort il persevere, \nQu\u2019il se dissoult, et tout en pleurs se fond, \nPleurs restagnantz en un grand lac profound, \nDont descent puis ce ruisseau argentin, \nQui me congele, et ainsi me confond \nTout transform\u00e9 en sel Agringentin (D373) \n \nHis eye also \u2018dissolves\u2019 in D200, and, in D13, his body is reduced to cinders \nwhich the wind threatens to scatter. In several dizains, the lady-sun \u2018melts\u2019 \nthe je:  \n \nComme gel\u00e9e au monter du Soleil, \nMon ame sens, qui toute se distille \nAu rencontrer le rayant de son \u0153il (D290) \n \nJe me deffis \u00e0 si belle rencontre, \nComme rouse au lever du Soleil (D223) \n                                                 \n29\n G\u00e9rard Defaux explains that this verb comes from the Latin confundo. He provides the following \npossible meanings for it: m\u00ealer, brouiller, render m\u00e9connaissable, m\u00e9tamorphoser (vol. II, p. 407). \n 16 \n \nComme neige au Soleil, je me fondz (D118) \n \n Thus, in the D\u00e9lie, the human subject is subjected by the lady-sun to a \nsort of fragmentation or division of the self, and a sort of mixing of himself. \nThis recalls some of the terms used to describe the effects of the intellectus-\nsun upon nature in Bovelles\u2019s Ars. Opposition brings about a divisio in \nnature. In addition, although paradoxically nature is presented in chapter 7 as \nmixed unless illuminated by the intellectus, elsewhere we are told that nature \ncan remain \u2018unmixed\u2019 only because it is involved in identity rather than \nopposition (which, as we have seen, is produced by the intellectus).\n30\n In \nother words, the opposition introduced by the intellectus-light brings with it \nboth mixing and division. Thus in both the D\u00e9lie and the Ars, a human light \n(the lady or the intellectus) inflict not only opposition but also, by the same \ntoken, mixing and division. However, in the Ars Oppositorum, terms like \n\u2018mixing\u2019 and \u2018division\u2019 apply to what occurs in some sense to nature: they \nare associated with the discussions of cosmic things being in their own place \nor an unnatural place. By contrast, in the D\u00e9lie, although the sun is subjected \nto complex relations of difference, terms suggesting division and mixing \nrefer to the effects of a perception or gaze not so much upon nature as upon \n                                                 \n30\n Pp. 66, 76. See n. 13.  \n 17 \nthe poetic subject. Furthermore, division and mixing describe the state of the \npoetic subject within himself rather than in his relations to other terms.  \n \niv) Difference in the Ars Oppositorum: Violence, the Trinity, and the \nHuman Subject \nThe \u2018division\u2019 and \u2018mixing\u2019 of the je may have its positive aspects (for \nexample, \u2018si belle rencontre\u2019, D223 quoted above), but it is often presented \nin quite anguished terms. Like the sun, the je has his light darkened, and is \nsubjected to difference. Furthermore, while the lady\u2019s infliction of difference \nmay make the sun \u2018jealous\u2019, she has a particularly negative impact upon the \nhuman subject, who melts and is burnt and so on.  By contrast, in the Ars \nOppositorum the human subject has a more privileged experience of \ndifference. The human soul does experience a sort of separation from itself \nbut this is expressed in very positive terms. Bovelles writes that the \nsubstance of the human soul \u0154 in common with divine and angelic \nsubstances alone \u0154 can experience true wisdom or sapientia.31 This sapientia \ninvolves separation (discretio) of the human soul from itself but this is \nthought of as multiplication or development (propagatio), which contrasts \nwith Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s trickling or blowing away. This process in the Ars is \n                                                 \n31\n pp. 46-8. See also De Sapiente and \u2018L\u2019Id\u00e9al du sage\u2019. \n 18 \nundeniably positive: not only is it something shared with the divine but it \nalso involves gaining knowledge of the self; by contrast, as we have seen, \nthe je in the D\u00e9lie laments the undermining of his gaze or understanding, in \nother words, of his ability to know. Furthermore, although the human \nintellectus is in some sense divided, Bovelles states that it is the only \nsublunary \u2018thing\u2019 which is indivisible and unitary: \u2018it is evident \u2026 that under \nthe heavens only the human intellectus is indivisible, truly one and \nimmortal.\u201932 The intellectus as described by Bovelles thus has a radically \ndifferent experience of selfhood and knowledge from that of the human \nsubject in the D\u00e9lie. \nFernand Hallyn, in his discussion of  Bovelles\u2019s De Sapiente (On the \nWise Man) \u0154 which was published with the Ars in 1511 and which further \nexplores Bovelles\u2019s notion of human sapientia \u0154, suggests that the \nmultiplication of Bovelles\u2019s human subject points to a gap inherent in \nrepresentation and resemblance, that is, to the gap of difference, which, \naccording to Hallyn, the metaphysics, the aesthetics, and the art of \nBovelles\u2019s period were all striving to suppress.33 Hallyn\u2019s analysis makes \n                                                 \n32\n \u2018Manifestum est \u2026 sub celis solus humanus intellectus esse impartibilis vere unus atque immortalis\u2019 \n(p. 82). \n33\n \u2018Le Microcosme ou l\u2019incompl\u00e9tude de la repr\u00e9sentation\u2019, in Romanica Gandensia XVII (1980), pp. 183-\n92. \n 19 \nuse of Freud, and is informed by modern theories of subjectivity. Indeed, for \nthe modern reader familiar with psychoanalysis, it may be easier to accept \nHallyn\u2019s notion of representation than Bovelles\u2019s alignment of self-\nknowledge with self-unity: in Lacan\u2019s famous mirror-stage, it is by \nperceiving oneself that one becomes subject to fragmentation and loses \none\u2019s infant wholeness. However, Bovelles\u2019s own writing does not point to \nthis psychoanalytic conception of the human subject: if this conception is \nindeed suppressed, then the suppression seems very effective. Hallyn \nobserves that Bovelles\u2019s multiplication of the human subject as \u2018homo-\nhomo-homo\u2019 constitutes a \u2018chain\u2019 which could be infinitely extended, like \nany chain of signifiers; its triple nature is, Hallyn suggests, arbitrary. \nHowever, as far as Bovelles is concerned, the human soul takes the form of a \ncircle rather than a chain (p. 185); moreover, the tripling of the \u2018homo\u2019 is far \nfrom arbitrary, since it bestows upon man the Trinitarian number and \ntherefore supports Bovelles\u2019s suggestion that difference within the human \nintellectus resembles that within the divine. \nFor Bovelles, then, the human subject \u0154 or rather the human soul \u0154 \ncan achieve a privileged sort of self-difference, a \u2018separation\u2019 from the self \nwhich is shared only with the divine, and which sounds rather different from \nthe divisio imposed upon nature by the intellectus and opposition. Indeed, \n 20 \nthe divisio of nature is, as we have seen, sometimes painted in implicitly \nnegative terms as a violence or force inflicted upon things. However, these \nnegative terms are not distributed evenly throughout the Ars, and ultimately \neven the opposition within nature \u0154 while it cannot constitute the privileged \nsapientia of the human subject \u0154 does not seem to be conceived as negative. \nIndeed it is often described using the language of the Trinity. Thus in the \nopening chapter, Bovelles explains that the two extremes of an opposition \u0154 \nthe monad and the dyad \u0154 \u2018engender\u2019 a third term, the triad; this \n\u2018engendering\u2019 of a third term clearly recalls the production of the Holy Spirit \nby the Father and the Son. This sort of language returns repeatedly. For \nexample, in the medium point there is a trace of the creativity of the divine \nTrinity (p.40), and in the three circles which represent the extremes and the \nmiddle term, one can perceive the mystery of the Trinity (p. 51). Although \nchapters 4, 6 and 7 in particular emphasise the violence of opposition, the \nfinal chapters return to emphasising the circles, the triad, and the middle \nterm, which can be described using Trinitarian language.  \nThus, while the dyad of opposites might imply violence, this violence \nis apparently redeemed by the triad which is much more positively \nconceived. As a result, while difference occasionally appears violent and \nnegative, in the case of the human soul it resembles Trinitarian difference, \n 21 \nand even in other cases it implicitly bears some resemblance to it. If all \nthings cannot be quite so definitively created \u2018in the image of God\u2019 (Genesis \n26-7) as man was, they nonetheless seem to bear some trace of his image.\n34\n   \n \n*** \n \nThus the argument that Bovelles suppresses negative conceptions of \ndifference is difficult to ground in Bovelles\u2019s own writing. However, another \nearly sixteenth-century text \u0154 the D\u00e9lie \u0154 shares some of Bovelles\u2019s \napprehensions of difference and yet ultimately construes them with more \nnegative implications. Like the Ars Oppositorum, the D\u00e9lie plays with non-\nbinary models of difference; however, ultimately these non-binary models \nimply a less positive experience of difference, particularly for the human \nsubject. Both the Ars and the D\u00e9lie suggest that a powerful light or gaze \nmight function to create differences. However, in Bovelles\u2019s Ars both the \ndivine and the human can have a privileged relation to difference and to \nknowledge. By contrast, this sapientia seems to be an impossibility for the je \nin the D\u00e9lie: he perceives the power of a cognitive and creative \u2018light\u2019 in the \n                                                 \n34\n This is a particular inflection of the notion that the cosmos and individual cosmic phenomena constitute \nimages of God, an idea which justified the project of natural theology, that is the attempt to know God by \nstudying the natural world.  \n 22 \nfigure of the lady, yet he suffers from this gaze rather than being similarly \nempowered. Sc\u00e8ve may lack Bovelles\u2019s confidence in the positive nature of \ndifference because of love lyric\u2019s depiction of the beloved with the traits of \nthe divine. Indeed, in his De Sapiente Bovelles makes it clear that the \nmovement of human cognition cannot be dissociated from the downward \nmovement of the divine, which is a gift from God to man.\n35\n The ie in the \nD\u00e9lie relates not to God but rather to a lady who, in accordance with love \nlyric\u2019s divinisation of the beloved, has usurped God\u2019s place and yet is \ncruel:\n36\n whereas the human subject in the Ars has a positive experience of \ndifference because of his relationship with the angelic and the divine, the \ndivinity of the D\u00e9lie inflicts difference rather than redeeming it.\n37\n  \n                                                 \n35\n \u2018Le mouvement anagogique de la raison ne saurait cependant \u00eatre disjoint du mouvement condescendant \nde la lumi\u00e8re divine\u2019 (\u2018L\u2019Id\u00e9al du sage\u2019, p. 108).  \n36\n In particular, whereas in the D\u00e9lie the lady is the desired sun, in the De Sapiente God is the sun \u2018vers \nlequel tend par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 tout d\u00e9sir ou savoir\u2019 (Vasoli, \u2018Th\u00e8mes solaires\u2019, p. 118).  \n37\n My doctoral thesis discusses, from a different angle, the relationship between Sc\u00e8ve\u2019s depiction of the \nlady in the D\u00e9lie and contemporary depictions of God; it also discusses the link between this and the \nsuffering of the je.
