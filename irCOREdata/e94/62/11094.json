Narratives are among the frequently taught written text types in general \nforeign language courses starting from the beginning level, and they are also included in the \ncurriculum of composition classes for higher level college learners. A large number of high-stakes \nlanguage proficiency tests also employ narrative tasks to assess FL learners\u2019 writing competence \n(such as most levels of Cambridge ESOL proficiency exams). Moreover, narrative accounts of \nevents are important in authentic written communication contexts, and narratives can be embedded \nin other text types such as supporting evidence in argumentative writing.  \n Another relatively under-researched area in the field of FL writing is the role of task \ncomplexity in writing performance. Whereas the effect of task-complexity on oral language \nproduction has been in the forefront of investigations in the past twenty years (for a recent summary \nsee Samuda and Bygate, 2008), considerably less research has been conducted on how different task \ntypes and the complexity of tasks influence written output produced by FL learners (see e.g. Ellis & \nYuan, 2004; Ishikawa, 2006; Kuiken & Vedder, 2008; Ong & Zhang, 2010). Gaining an insight into \nhow different task characteristics are associated with the linguistic and discourse feature of LFL \nwritten texts could assist both language teachers and testers in selecting tasks that have the potential \nto elicit the targeted features of writing competence.  \n The current study contributes to examining interfaces between second language acquisition \nresearch and the study of L2 writing by exploring the issue of task complexity in the domain of FL \n 2 \nwriting. The research presented in this paper aimed to investigate the linguistic and discourse \ncharacteristics of FL narratives produced by upper-intermediate foreign language learners in a \nbilingual secondary school. In our analyses we used a variety of linguistic and discourse variables \nand a recently developed computer tool (Coh-Metrix 2.0: McNamara, Louwerse, & Graesser, 2002) \nto describe the characteristics of narrative texts. Although our study is based on a relatively small \nsample of student performances and on data collected at one specific level of proficiency, the range \nof variables used for the analysis is considerably wider than in previous research investigating the \nlinguistic features of FL writing performance. Our analyses also exemplify how variables used to \nassess writing quality and measures of performance applied in task-based research can be combined \nto provide an insight into the nature of FL writing. This micro-analytic perspective, which is \ndemonstrated on a small data-base in this study, can provide an example on the basis of which \nfurther research using a larger corpus and a wider variety of text types can be conducted. As the \ncomputer analytic tools in this study are freely available and easy to use, they can be applied by \nwriting teachers to diagnose areas of weaknesses and strengths in students\u2019 linguistic repertoire and \nuse of discourse markers, by assessors of second language writing to generate automated measures \nof lexical and syntactic complexity and cohesion, and last but not least by student writers to assess \nthe quality of their own writing. \nAs a background for comparison, we also collected data from a small group of L1 writers in \norder to gain an insight into features of written task performance that is not hindered by difficulties \nin accessing linguistic knowledge required to execute a task.  The comparison between the \ncharacteristics of L1 and FL narrative performance can yield information on the lexical and \nsyntactic performance as well as on the frequency of cohesive markers that a particular narrative \nwriting task can be expected to elicit and can inform writing pedagogy and assessment about how \ntask demands shape language use. \nThe study also intended to answer the question how different types of narrative tasks that \nmake different cognitive demands on writers affect the linguistic and discourse features of output. \n 3 \nIn this research project, two types of task were administered to students: a cartoon description task \nin which students had to narrate a given content, and a picture story task, in which students had to \ninvent the plot of their narrative. Both in the assessment of FL writing and in writing pedagogy, it is \nan important question to what extent the fact that students are allowed to generate the content of \ntheir text and potentially tailor it to match their available linguistic resources influences \nperformance, especially the accuracy of writing. The fact that students can avoid certain syntactic \nand lexical structures when they generate their own content might hinder linguistic development \nand might provide only a partial view of students\u2019 linguistic competence in writing. Specifying the \ncontent of the written task, however, might necessitate the use of lexical and syntactic structures \ntargeted by teachers and language testers, and might make avoidance difficult. From this \nperspective, tasks with a predetermined content might be more reliable measures of linguistic \ncompetence in writing, but we have to note that the authenticity and motivating power of these tasks \nmight be questionable.  \nIn this paper, first the theoretical background of the study is reviewed, which is followed by \nthe description of the study and the methods of analysis. Next, the results are presented and \ndiscussed. The paper is concluded with a detailed discussion of the implications of the findings and \nan outline for future research directions. \n \nBackground \n \nOne of the important albeit neglected questions in second language writing pedagogy is how \ndifferent task characteristics influence the quality of students\u2019 writing.  Most models of the \nprocesses involved in writing focus on mechanisms of planning, the linguistic formulation of \nplanned content and revision (e.g. Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987; Flower & Hayes, 1980; Kellogg, \n1996) and have been developed for L1 and not second language (L2) and FL writers.  None of these \nmodels discuss how the particular features of different writing tasks influence these processes and \n 4 \nhow writers divide their attention among the various composing processes as a result of the \ndifferent task demands.  \nIn second language speech production research, where the role of task demands has been \nthoroughly researched, task characteristics are mostly discussed with reference to task complexity. \nIn Robinson\u2019s (2001) definition, \u201ctask complexity is the result of attentional, memory, and other \ninformation processing demands imposed by the structure of the task on the language learner\u201d (p. \n29). Robinson lists a number of task characteristics such as the number of elements to be considered \nin a decision-making task, availability of planning time and prior knowledge, which influence the \ncomplexity of the task. Although these task characteristics can be manipulated in task-design, it is \nnot a simple enterprise to establish a rank order of complexity for different types of pedagogic \ntasks.  \nIn order to define the construct of task complexity in writing tasks, it is important to \nconsider the demands that these tasks make at different stages of the writing process. In Kellogg\u2019s \n(1996) model, writing consists of three important interactive- and recursive processes: formulation, \nexecution and monitoring. Formulation involves planning the content of the writing and translating \nideas into words. During planning, writers retrieve ideas from their long term memory or from the \ninput provided in the task rubrics and organize them in a coherent order. In translating ideas into \nlinguistic form three processes can be distinguished: retrieval of the lexical items, syntactic \nencoding of clauses and sentences and expressing cohesive relationships in the text. In the \nexecution stage, writers use motor movements to create a hand-written or typed text. Finally, \nmonitoring ensures that the created text adequately expresses the writer\u2019s intention, and if \nmismatches are found, the text is revised.  \nThe cognitive complexity of L2 writing tasks that originates from the characteristics of the \ntask itself can be hypothesized to be inherent in the formulation stage and can be determined by the \ndemands tasks make on the planning of the content of the written text and\/or on the linguistic \nencoding of the content. Task complexity inherent in the task itself is generally considered to derive \n 5 \nfrom the conceptual demands a task makes in the planning stage. This view is based on the \nassumption that complex concepts require the use of complex syntactic structures, and hence \ncognitively complex tasks are complex both in terms of planning and linguistic formulation (see e.g. \nRobinson\u2019s (2001, 2003, 2005) Cognition Hypothesis). It is, however, possible that tasks make \nseparate complexity demands on the planning and formulation stages. If we consider two writing \ntasks such as the ones used in the current study \u2500 a cartoon description task, in which the story-line \nis given, and a picture narration task, in which students have to narrate their own story \u2500 we can see \nthat different aspects of task complexity might have a differential effect on the writing process. In a \ncartoon description task, students do not need to conceptualize the content of the story, which eases \nthe complexity demands in the phase of planning, that is, in selecting and ordering the relevant \nideas (Kellogg, 1996). Nevertheless, students have to express the content prescribed by the task in \nwhatever linguistic resources they have available in the L2, which increases the processing load in \nthe linguistic encoding (transcribing) phase. In a story narration task, however, learners need to \ndesign their own story, but they can tailor it to match their linguistic resources, which results in \nincreased conceptualization effort during planning and a potentially reduced load in the transcribing \nprocess.  \nA key factor in task-based language learning, which is also relevant in studying second \nlanguage writing, is that students need to the allocation of their attention in order to successfully \nmeet the linguistic demands of the task. There are two influential models of task complexity in this \nfield, which have attempted to  answer the question how attentional resources can be used, \ncoordinated and directed to different aspects of language production during task completion: \nSkehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) Limited Attentional Capacity Model and Robinson\u2019s (2001, 2003, \n2005) Cognition Hypothesis. These models make contrasting predictions as to the effect of \nincreasing task complexity along various dimensions on L2 performance.  \nSkehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) Limited Attentional Capacity Model views attention and \nmemory as limited in capacity; therefore, they suggest that increasing task complexity reduces the \n 6 \npool of available attention and memory resources. As a result, some aspects of performance will be \nattended to while others will not. Skehan and Foster also claim that cognitively more demanding \ntasks draw learners\u2019 attention away from linguistic forms so that enough attention can be paid to the \ncontent of the message (for a recent account of the model see Skehan, 2009).     \nCognition Hypothesis differs from the Limited Attentional Capacity Model in that it \nassumes that attention is subject to voluntary regulation. In the Cognition Hypothesis, two sets of \ndimensions of cognitive task complexity are distinguished: resource-directing and resource-\ndispersing dimensions. The resource-directing dimensions of task performance call learners\u2019 \nattention to the linguistic features which are needed to meet task demands (e.g., reference to events \nhappening here and now vs. to events taking place then and there), whereas the resource-dispersing \ndimensions of the task act as attentional limitations in determining what aspect of the task can be \nheeded (e.g., reducing the pre-task planning time). The Cognition Hypothesis states that sequencing \ntasks from cognitively simple to complex allows students to progress towards successfully \nperforming real-world target tasks. Robinson proposes that increasing task complexity along \nresource-directing dimensions can lead to greater accuracy and grammatical complexity of L2 \noutput because such demands can direct learners\u2019 attention to how the concepts and functions \nrequired by the task have to be grammaticized using specific linguistic forms. Increasing \ncomplexity along resource-dispersing dimensions, however, depletes learners\u2019 attention without \nhaving the beneficial effect of directing it to any specific linguistic aspect of L2 production.     \nThe hypotheses put forward by the Limited Attentional Capacity model and the Cognition \nHypothesis have received mixed support, which is probably due to the fact that in some tasks, \ncertain characteristics make resource-dispersing attentional demands on learners, whereas others \nsimultaneously draw their attention to certain linguistic aspects of performance. Few studies have \nexamined systematically the combined effects of resource-directing and resource-dispersing \nvariables on performance (but see Gilabert, 2005\uf03b Iwashita et al., 2001; R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, 2009), although in \n 7 \nreal-world communicative tasks these two dimensions simultaneously affect performance (for a \nrecent discussion of this issue see Pallotti, (2009)).  \nIt also needs to be considered that due to the fact that writing is often a less time-constrained \nactivity than speaking, the resource-dispersing dimension of task complexity might play a different \nrole than hypothesized for speaking tasks. Unlike in speech, students do not need to simultaneously \nplan and linguistically encode their message, and therefore L2 writers can focus on one stage of \nprocessing at a time. Nevertheless, the limitation of attentional resources might influence writing \nprocesses especially in an L2. L2 writers might need to pay more attention to lexical and syntactic \nencoding in the composing process, and consequently might not be able to devote sufficient \nresources to the global organization of the text (McCutchen, 1996). Moreover, despite the fact that \nin writing the monitoring of the output does not need to be carried out parallel with producing the \noutput, L2 writers might experience difficulties in heeding both linguistic accuracy and the \ndiscourse structure in the monitoring process. \n Research on the role of task-types and cognitive complexity in L2 and FL written task \nperformance has been scarce. One line of investigations in this field has concentrated on how the \nprovision of planning time affects the linguistic characteristics (fluency, accuracy and lexical and \nsyntactic complexity) of writing. Ellis and Yuan (2004) found that students in the pre-task planning \ncondition wrote longer narrative texts and used a wider variety of syntactic structures as opposed to \nlearners who were not allowed to make use of pre-task planning time. These results were also \nreplicated in a recent study by Ong and Zhang (2010) with regard to the fluency and lexical variety \nof argumentative tasks. Ong and Zhang also studied two further dimensions of task complexity \nparticularly relevant to the writing process: the availability of previous drafts, which was not found \nto have an effect on the fluency and lexical variety of writing, and the provision of ideas and \nmacrostructure, which influenced the lexical variety of students\u2019 output. Kuiken and Vedder\u2019s \n(2008) research addressed the question how the number of elements students had to take into \naccount in a letter writing task impacts on the linguistic characteristics of written tasks. Their results \n 8 \nindicated that students were more accurate in the cognitively more complex task in which they had \nto consider a higher number of elements, but in terms of the syntactic complexity and lexical variety \nno differences were observed. Ishikawa (2006) studied another dimension of task-complexity in \nnarrative writing: the +\/- Here and Now dimension. Students who had to write a narrative in the \npast tense (-Here and Now condition) were found to be more accurate and fluent and displayed \nhigher syntactic complexity than those whose essays had to be produced in the present tense (+Here \nand Now condition). Although these studies analyzed different aspects of task complexity and used \ndifferent measures to assess the linguistic quality of students, and thus their results are often \ncontradictory, they all seem to suggest that more complex writing tasks might have beneficial \neffects on writing quality. \nIn the field of the assessment of second language writing, researchers have also investigated \nhow different types of task affect test scores. Schoonen\u2019s (2005) study indicated that the type of text \nstudents had to produce in a test of writing had a greater effect on scores than the learners\u2019 writing \nability, which highlights the importance of examining particular features of the task that might \ncontribute to variance in writing performance. In another study, Hamp-Lyons and Mathias (1994) \nfound that in tasks which were judged as more difficult by expert raters, students achieved higher \nscores than in tasks which were deemed easier. They argued that cognitively complex writing tasks \nmight motivate learners to produce better performance than cognitively less complex tasks. \nIn order to understand how particular writing tasks affect the composing processes and \ntrigger particular language use, it is also important to consider how L1 writers perform under \nvarious task conditions as it gives an insight into which characteristics of the writing tasks are \ninherent in the task itself and which ones cause variation only among writers whose language \nproficiency is not fully developed. In a series of studies Kellogg (1988, 1990) investigated the effect \nof outlining on writing fluency and quality among L1 writers and found that planning influenced \nspecific qualities of the text but played a limited role in writing fluency.  \n 9 \nAnother important issue to consider when comparing task effects in L1 and L2 is the \ndifference between L1 and L2 composing processes. Despite the fact that writing is less constrained \nby time than speaking, working memory limitations still play an important role in the various stages \nof writing. Kellogg (2001) pointed out that specific components of working memory are involved in \nnearly every stage of writing from planning to editing. Studies examining the development of \nwriting skills among children also show that lower level writing skills such as hand-writing and \nspelling need to sufficiently automatic for children to be able to coherent texts (e.g. Bourdin & \nFayol 1996). Working memory limitations and the lack of automaticity in lower level writing skills \nare particularly relevant for L2 writers, whose attentional capacities are often depleted by struggling \nwith the linguistic encoding of their message. For most L2 students, except for the most advanced \nones, the execution and monitoring stage of writing requires considerably more effort than for L1 \nwriters. As Schoonen et al. (2009) argue, below a certain threshold of FL linguistic knowledge, the \nwriter will be fully absorbed in struggling with the language, inhibiting writing processes such as \nplanning or monitoring\u201d (p.81). In other words, adequate L2 competence is an important pre-\nrequisite for the improvement of higher level writing skills such as planning, formulation and \nrevision (Manch\u00f3n et al., 2009).  \nThe differences between L1 and L2 writers do not only manifest themselves in the \npsycholinguistic processes of composing, but also in the quality of the writing produced (for a \ncomprehensive review see Leki, Cumming & Silva, 2008). A number of indices of syntactic \ncomplexity, such as the length of T-units, the frequency of sub-ordinate clauses, noun-modification, \nindicated that L2 texts tend to be syntactically less complex than L1 texts (for a comprehensive \nstudy see Hinkel, 2002). Previous research also shows that texts produced by L1 writers are \ncharacterized by higher lexical variation and sophistication than essays produced by ESL learners \n(for a recent study see Crossley & McNamara, 2009). The cohesion of L1 and L2 writing was also \nfound to differ across a number of dimensions. Although the overall frequency of cohesive devices \nmight not be a reliable indicator of the general quality of the text (Connor, 1984), the under- and \n 10 \nover-use of specific cohesive markers by L2 writers might suggest that cohesive relations are not as \neffectively expressed by L2 learners as by L1 writers (for recent study on narratives see Kang, \n2005).  \n \nThe aims of the research  \n \nThe study reported in this paper intended to fill the apparent research niche concerning the \nlinguistic and discourse structure of narratives in L1 and FL writing. Another aim of the research \nwas to examine the role of task-complexity in second language writing. The research presented in \nthis paper is also novel in its selection of participants as it focuses on an under-represented group of \nFL writers: secondary school students (see Leki et al., 2008). In this project I collected narrative \ntask data from 44 upper-intermediate Hungarian learners of English as well as from 10 young native \nspeakers of British English. The main research question of the study was the following: \n1. What are the lexical, syntactic and cohesive differences between two types of written \nnarratives tasks: one in which the content of the narrative is given and another in which \nstudents need to plan the content of their stories? \nThe following subsidiary research question was also posed:  \n2. How does the performance of L1 and FL writers differ in terms of lexical, syntactic and \ncohesive characteristics in two narrative tasks which make different cognitive complexity \ndemands on the stages of writing? \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nThe study was conducted at two research cites: in a Hungarian-English bilingual secondary school \nin Budapest, Hungary and at a university in the UK.  The Hungarian participants were students \n(N=44) in the second academic year of a bilingual education program, which consists of a so-called \n 11 \nzero year and four years of bilingual secondary education. During the zero-year the students took \npart in an intensive English language training program, which aimed to prepare them for studying \nseveral school subjects in English in the following four years of secondary school. The teaching \nmethod used was predominantly communicative combined with focus-on-form instruction. The \nparticipants of our study completed the zero-year program in June 2006 before starting their \nsecondary studies in September 2006. At the time of the data-collection for the present research, \nthey had just begun the second academic year of their studies, and their age was between 17 and 18 \nyears (27 female and 17 male). The participants\u2019 level of proficiency was rated as slightly above \nintermediate (corresponding to B1\/B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference (Council \nof Europe, 2001) by their teachers on the basis of the language tests that they administer to the \nstudents. \n The participants in the UK were 10 under-graduate students (3 male and 7 female), who had \njust started their university studies at undergraduate level. They were between 18 and 20 years old \nand were studying Linguistics. At the time of the research, however, which was the beginning of the \nautumn term of the first year of their studies, they had limited experiences concerning academic \nwriting at university level. The students all passed an A-level exam in English Language. This \npopulation of students was selected to serve as a benchmark for writing performance expected from \nnative English speakers who, after finishing their secondary education, pursue studies at university \nlevel. \n \n \nInstruments \nThe cartoon description task involved the description of a comic strip consisting of six pictures, \nwhich had to be included in the story. The pictures were presented in the correct order and formed a \ncoherent story line. The input to the task was provided visually, with instructions in the first \nlanguage of the participants. The cartoon told a story of a car which  broke down in the middle of \n 12 \nthe desert. The car was transformed into a carriage without a horse by a wizard instead of being \nrepaired. This type of task did not require the conceptualization of the plot, and was consequently \nconsidered to place a relatively low cognitive load on the participants in terms of conceptualizing \ntheir message. This task, however, could potentially elicit the use of certain low-frequency words \nsuch as carriage and wizard. The picture narration task required students to tell a story based on six \nunrelated pictures, which all had to be included in the narrative. The picture clues consisted of a \nbook, a storm on sea, a boat, an island, a house in a town, and an open door.  In order to \nsuccessfully complete this task, the participants not only had to rely on their language skills, but \nthey also had to use their imagination and find a way to relate the pictures to one another and invent \na story around them. In terms of conceptualization, this task can be characterized as cognitively \nmore complex than the cartoon description task. The tasks were adapted from Albert\u2019s (2007) \ndissertation, in which these tasks were administered orally to a similar target population. \n  \nProcedures \nThe tasks were previously piloted on a similar sample, and proved to be solvable within the \navailable time-frame. In the pilot study students did not report any difficulties with understanding \nthe cartoons, and the stories produced did not reveal any misunderstandings of the plot either. \nParticipants in Hungary completed two written narrative tasks one after the other during a \nregular English class. The students were asked to work individually and were not allowed to use \nany dictionaries or thesauruses. They wrote their text in handwriting under the supervision of their \nclassroom teachers. Students in the UK wrote the two narratives in a separate room at the \nuniversity. They were supervised by the author of this article and were not allowed to use any \nassistive tools or devices. \nThe participants in both settings had 30 minutes to complete the two tasks. They were \ninstructed to write a minimum of 150 words for each task. The students could decide on the order in \n 13 \nwhich they completed the tasks. Approximately 55% of the students started with the cartoon \ndescription task, and 45% of the students chose to write the story narration task first. \n \nAnalysis \nA large number of variables were used to assess various aspects of written performance (for a \nsummary see Table 1).  \nLexical competence \nIn order to measure lexical diversity, we applied Malvern and Richards' (1997) D-formula. The \ncalculation of the D-value is based on a mathematical probabilistic model as operationalized in the \nVOCD software of the CHILDES database (http\/\/childes.psy.cmu.edu), which uses a random \nselection of tokens in plotting the curve of TTR against increasing token size for the text to be \ninvestigated (Malvern and Richards, 1997).  This measure has been used in a number of studies \n(e.g. Harris Wright, Silverman, & Newhoff, 2003; Malvern et al., 2004; Owen & Leonard, 2002; \nSilverman & Bernstein Ratner, 2000), and although some researchers argue that the D-value is \ndependent on text-length (e.g. McCarthy & Jarvis, 2007, 2010), it is still one of the most reliable \nmeasures of lexical diversity that can be calculated by available software programs. Alternative \nassessments of lexical diversity also show very high correlation with D-value (McCarthy & Jarvis, \n2010). \nVocabulary range was measured with the help of Nation\u2019s Range program (Heatley, Nation, \n& Coxhead, 2002). This program identifies what percentage of the words students used in their \nnarratives belongs to the most frequent 1000 words (Base-list 1) and 2000 words (Base-list 2) based \non \u201cA General Service List of English Words\u201d by West (1953). The program also assesses what \npercentage of words is frequent in upper secondary school and university texts from a wide range of \nsubjects (Base-list 3). This third frequency band is based on \u201cThe Academic Word List\u201d by \nCoxhead (1998, 2000).  \n 14 \nThe Coh-Metrix 2.0 program was used to analyze the concreteness of content words. Coh-\nMetrix provides concreteness ratings based on the MRC Psycholinguistics Database (Coltheart, \n1981). Concreteness values in this program can range from 100 to 700, where a high value indicates \nthat the words used tend to be highly concrete and a low value that the words are abstract. Coh-\nMetrix 2.0 also calculates the frequency of content words. From among the measures of the \nfrequency of content words, the log frequency of content words was selected because it was found \nto be a more reliable indicator of lexical complexity than the raw frequency of content words \n(Haberlandt & Graesser, 1985; Just & Carpenter, 1980).  \n \nSyntactic complexity and accuracy \nSyntactic complexity was operationalized as the ratio of subordinate clauses, which was expressed \nrelative to the total number of clauses and as the length of clauses, which was calculated as the \nnumber of words within a clause (Norris & Ortega, 2009). An additional measure of syntactic \ncomplexity was the mean number of modifiers per noun-phrase, which was calculated using the \nCoh-Metrix 2.0 program, and which gives information about the complexity of noun-phrases. Coh-\nMetrix 2.0 also provides a measure of the mean number of words before the main verb, which \nreflects clausal complexity. In the case of second language writers, accuracy of performance was \nmeasured with the ratio of error-free clauses, which was calculated relative to the total number of \nclauses. \n \nCohesion \nCohesion indices were also obtained with the use of the Coh-Metrix 2.0 program, which identifies \nthe frequency of different types of connectives and provides spatial, temporal, intentional and \ncausal cohesion indices. Connectives were selected because they are important devices to signal \nrelations in text and as such contribute to coherent discourse (Halliday & Hasan, 1976).  The skilful \nuse of connectives can provide an insight into the textual quality of writing (Cameron et al., 1995). \n 15 \nConnectives can be characterized as positive, when they extend the information provided in the text \n(e.g. and, because, after), and as negative, when they restrict and cease to elaborate information \n(e.g. but, until, although) (Louwerse, 2002; Sanders, Spooren & Noordman, 1992). Connectives can \nbe also classified as additive, temporal, causal and logical (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). Based on this \nclassification system, the incidence of positive and negative additive (e.g. and, however, but, also), \ntemporal (when, after, until), causal (because, therefore, although) and logical connectives (or, if, \nunless) was measured using the Coh-Metrix 2.0 program. \n Although there are other ways of analyzing cohesion such as coreference and argument \noverlap (Kintsch & Van Dijk, 1978) and latent semantic analysis (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, \nLanduaer & Harshman, 1990; Landauer & Dumais, 1997), these are difficult to measure reliably for \nshort texts. Therefore I decided to apply an analysis of the situational dimension of cohesion \n(Kintsch, 1998; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). Zwaan and Radvansky (1998) identified five situational \ndimensions of cohesion: causation, intentionality, time, space and protagonists. These dimensions \nof cohesion are expressed with the help of connectives, particles, nouns and verbs. Coh-Metrix 2.0 \ncan provide indices for causal, intentional, temporal and spatial cohesion, but due to the fact that the \nintentional cohesion measures were 0 for the majority of participants, the figures for intentional \ncohesion are not reported in this study. Causal cohesion is a measure of the extent to which explicit \ncausal links between sentences are expressed and is particularly relevant in narrating events. The \nindex of causal cohesion is calculated by dividing the total number of causal verbs with causal \nparticles. Temporal cohesion, which reflects the extent to which verb tenses and aspects assist in the \nformation of a cohesive text, is operationalized as the averaged repetition score for tense and aspect. \nSpatial cohesion, which is a measure of how spatial content and the sentences are related by spatial \nparticles or relations, is calculated by averaging the location and motion ratio scores, which is \nderived from the the incidence of location and prepositions,  location nouns and motion verbs. \nIn preparation for the computer analysis, all texts were parsed by the author for ambiguous \nsentence structure and punctuation that might have potentially affected the interpretation of the text \n 16 \nby Coh-Metrix. No instances of ambiguity were found and occasionally missing punctuation marks \nwere manually inserted. A small selection of texts was resubmitted for computer analysis to check if \nthe same values for the linguistic and cohesive values were obtained. In all cases, the computer \nanalysis produced the same result. In order to ensure the reliability of the coding of the variables \nthat were not rated by computer analysis, another rater was asked to code the data. The Cohen\u2019s \nkappa for inter-rater agreement was 0.85. For the statistical analysis SPSS 13.0 (Statistical Package \nfor Social Sciences) was used.  \nDue to the fact that the analyzed variables were normally distributed in both groups of \nparticipants, parametric statistics were used despite the differing number of students in the groups. \nThe main statistical analysis used was the factorial analysis of variance with the task constituting \nthe within subjects variable and native\/non-native status the between subjects variable. Main effects \nas well as interactions of these variables were computed. In order to assess the importance of \ndifferences caused by the task and native status variables, both effect sizes (eta squared) and \nstatistical power (P) were used. \n \nInsert Table 1 around here \n \nResults  \n \nThe factorial analysis of variance detected only a small number of task effects (see Tables 2 and 3). \nThe picture narration task elicited more abstract words in general as indicated by the concreteness \nindex F (52) =20.54,  eta squared =.30, P =.99).  The effect size can be regarded as large (Cohen, \n1988), and the statistical power is also high, which shows that the difference between these tasks \nwith regard to concreteness is indeed important. The other task effect was found in the frequency of \npositive temporal connectives F (52) =5.67, eta squared =.10, P =.64). The effect size for this \ndifference was, however only in the medium range, and the statistical power was also lower than \n 17 \nexpected, which suggests that the task condition had a limited effect on the use of temporal \nconnectives.  \n------------------------------------- \nInsert Tables 2 and 3 here \n------------------------------------- \n \n \nThe results reveal significant differences between L1 and FL writers in terms of lexical \nvariety and complexity (see Tables 2 and 3). FL writers seemed to have used significantly less \nvaried vocabulary in both tasks (F (52) =20.24, eta squared =.31, P =.99) and significantly more \nwords from the first 1000 word-range (F (52) =36.75, eta squared =.43, P =1.0) than their native \ncounterparts. The eta squared values indicate a large effect size and the statistical power for these \ndifferences is also high. Non-native writers also produced significantly shorter clauses than the \nnative speaking participants (F (52) =4.90, eta squared =.09, P =.58), but the effect size values and \nthe statistical power analysis suggests that this difference is not of high importance. Similarly, the \neffect of native speaker status on causal cohesion can also be regarded as of medium size (F (52) \n=3.63, eta squared =.07, P =.48).  \n  \nDiscussion \n \nAs regards the effect of task demands on narrative performance, we can conclude that the need to \nconceptualize the story-line did not seem to result in major linguistic and cohesive changes.  It can \nbe argued that the lack of substantial difference between the two types of tasks is due to the fact that \nboth tasks required learners to write in the same genre. Genre is one of the important factors that \naffects the use of cohesive devices in writing (Smith & Frawley, 1983), and it also influences the \n 18 \nlexical and syntactic range of expression as well the use of connectives (for a review see Biber & \nConrad, 2009).  \nThe results concerning accuracy and syntactic complexity indices reveal that at the upper-\nintermediate level writers in this study did not avoid the use of complex syntactic structures and \nconstructions that they have not yet fully mastered when given the opportunity to tailor a narrative \ntext to match their own linguistic resources. Therefore, it might be assumed that both types of tasks \nprovide similar opportunities for learners to display their linguistic competence in writing. The task  \nin which students had to narrate predetermined content, however, seems to have promoted the use \nof more abstract vocabulary and triggered the use of more explicit signaling of temporal relations. \nThese findings are particularly interesting because in the lack of significant interaction between task \nand native-speaker status, it can be inferred that the differences in language use were caused by the \ntask demands. Consequently, the results can be taken to suggest that the fact that students had to \nencode given content might have promoted the use of more abstract vocabulary in the cartoon \ndescription task irrespective of whether students wrote in their L1 or in a FL. Both L1 and FL \nparticipants also employed temporal connectives to indicate the sequence of events in the cartoon \ndescription task more frequently than in the picture narration task. If we examine the overall \nfrequency of connectives in the two tasks we can notice that L1 and FL writers used slightly fewer \nconnectives overall in the picture narration task. A tentative explanation might be that the fact that \nthe participants had to plan the content of the story might have taken away from the attentional \nresources available for the explicit signaling of cohesive relations. A possible implication of this \nboth for second language acquisition research in general and for the study of writing in particular \nmight be that in addition to the traditional three aspects of task-based performance that are \njuxtaposed task based research: fluency, accuracy and complexity, the competition of attentional \nresources in writing tasks should also be considered  with regard to cohesion, writing fluency, \naccuracy and complexity. \n 19 \nAs for the competing theories of the role of attention in task performance, which in the past \nhave mainly been investigated in the context of L2 speech production, our findings with regard to \nFL writing suggest that the most important resource-directing characteristic of the cartoon \ndescription task is pushing learners to use more sophisticated vocabulary and thereby increasing \nlexical complexity. If the task in which students need to plan the content of their narrative is \nconsidered to be cognitively more complex, the findings do not provide support for Robinson\u2019s  \n(2001, 2003, 2005) Cognition Hypothesis, as except for one measure of lexical complexity, \nstudents\u2019 performance in the two tasks was similar, and the difference in lexical complexity is in the \nopposite direction predicted by the Cognition Hypothesis. The results, however, are not in line with \nSkehan and Foster\u2019s (2001) Limited Attentional Capacity Model either, as the two tasks displayed \nhighly similar accuracy values. Nevertheless, it is also possible that certain differences in cognitive \ncomplexity demands such as the one in the current study have a limited effect on the overall quality \nof writing. On the one hand, the time given for producing the narrative texts in this research might \nhave allowed students to utilize their attentional resources efficiently regardless of the fact whether \nthey had to plan the content of the story or not. On the other hand, in these tasks the two types of \ncomplexity demands: having to plan the content vs. encoding given content with the available \nlinguistic resources might have extinguished each other\u2019s effect. In the cartoon description task the \nFL writers were required to express the storyline with whatever linguistic knowledge they had \navailable, but they did not need to plan the story. The picture narration task can be considered the \nopposite, as here students had to devise a plot, but they could potentially avoid the use of linguistic \nconstructions which are beyond their competence. The results concerning the accuracy and \nsyntactic measures, however, suggest that this was not the case. \nThe comparison of our study with previous investigations on written task complexity is \ndifficult due to the different types of tasks, complexity factors and analytic tools employed in them. \nIn the study, which can be considered the most similar to the present research, Ong and Zhang \n(2010) found that lexical complexity, as measured by type-taken ratio adjusted for text length, was \n 20 \nhigher in the task condition where students were provided with the least amount of help concerning \nthe content of essay than in the two other conditions in which less support was given with regard to \ncontent. Our findings in this respect seem to be different as the task with given content elicited \nhigher lexical complexity as measured by the frequency of abstract words, and no differences \nbetween tasks were found with regard to D-value, which is the variable that can be regarded similar \nto the type-token ratio used in Ong and Zhang\u2019s study. The reason for this difference might be \nrelated to the fact that in Ong and Zhang\u2019s research participants were required to produce an \nargumentative text, whereas in our project we investigated narratives. \n The findings indicate significant differences between L1 and FL narratives in terms of \nlexical variety, complexity and syntactic complexity, but the cohesive features of the narratives \nshow similarities in the two groups of participants. The findings concerning the lack of significant \ndifferences in cohesion seem to be contradictory to the results concerning expository and \nargumentative genres (e.g. Connor, 1984; Leki et al., 2008; Tapper, 2005), in which FL learners \nwere generally found to use a higher frequency of co-ordinating conjunctions than L1 writers. The \nreasons for the similar frequency of co-ordinating conjunctions in this study might be related to the \ncharacteristics of the narrative genre and to the fact that no differences between in L1 and FL \nstudents in the ratio of sub-ordinate clauses was found either. It seems that the upper-intermediate \nlearners participating in this study were aware of the syntactic and cohesive demands of narratives \nin terms of co-ordination and conjunction and had the linguistic means to express these relations. \nThe only difference that might indicate higher level of cohesion in L1 writing can be observed in \nthe figures of causal cohesion, the values of which are almost twice as high in the L1 narratives than \nin FL texts, but these differences only have a medium effect size. Interestingly, Crossley and \nMcNamara\u2019s (in press) recent study,  in which Coh-Metrix was used to compare the cohesion of \nhigh and low rated FL essays, also found that essays produced by highly proficient students did not \ndisplay significantly different spatial, causal and temporal cohesive markers  than those written  at \nlower level of FL competence. It is important to note, however, that both Crossley and McNamara\u2019s \n 21 \n(2010) and our analysis only investigated the frequency of explicit markers of cohesion and was not \nsuitable for detecting qualitative differences in the use of cohesive markers. The fact that the \nfrequency of cohesive links as assessed by the Coh-Metrix program is similar does not mean that L1 \nand FL writers used these markers with similar efficiency and variety.  \nOur findings reveal that FL writers seem to use lexically less varied language, as shown by \nthe D-value, and their writing is lexically less dense as indicated by the frequency of content words. \nIn addition, FL writers were found to use more words from the first most frequent 1000 words, \nwhich reflects smaller vocabulary range. Taken together, these results show that in several areas of \nlexical competence (Meara, 2002) such as lexical variety, density and range, FL writers at upper-\nintermediate level show a significantly different profile from native speakers. This finding adds \nanother piece of evidence for the conclusion of other studies in second language writing and \nassessment (e.g. Crossley & McNamara, 2009, in press; Crossley, Salsbury, McNamara & Jarvis, in \npress, Jarvis et al., 2003; Meara & Bell, 2001) that  lexical profiency is an important component of \nwriting competence and an area FL writers need to focus on if they want to improve their \ncomposition skills. \n FL writers were found to display lower levels of clausal complexity as indicated by the \nvariables of clause length, but in terms of the mean number of words before main verbs and sub-\nordination complexity no differences between L1 and FL narratives was observed. These results \nseem to be different from the findings of studies on expository texts, in which FL writers produced \nlonger clauses (Gates, 1978; Reid, 1992; Silva, 1993) and used fewer sub-ordinate clauses (Hu et \nal., 1982; Park, 1988; Silva, 1993).  The differences between previous investigations and our study \nmight be explained with the discourse characteristics of narratives. Sub-ordinate clauses in general \nand relative clauses in particular have several important discourse and linguistic functions in \nnarratives, namely to name, situate and identify old and new referents in the story, to present main \ncharacters, to motivate, enable and continue narrative actions, to set up expectations about narrative \nentities and events and to sum up past or upcoming events (Dasinger & Toupin, 1994). Therefore, it \n 22 \nis probably due to these unavoidable functions of subordinate clauses that both L1 and FL writers \nused them with similar frequency in their narratives. With regard to the length of main clauses, the \ndifferences between L1 and FL writers can be assumed to be caused by the fact that L1 writers used \na considerably higher number of prepositional phrases and adverbs to add detail and emphasis to \ntheir stories.  \n \nConclusion \n \nThis paper demonstrated how issues traditionally raised in task-based research with reference to \nspeaking tasks can be investigated in the case of FL writing and how methods of analyses from the \nfields of writing research and psycholinguistic investigations of speech production can be combined \nto gain an insight into the characteristics of FL writing processes. In this paper I proposed new ways \nin which the cognitive complexity of tasks can be understood and analyzed in FL writing with \nreference to the different stages of the composing process. I argued that in addition to assuming that \ncognitively complex concepts increase task complexity both in the planning and formulation stage \nof writing, tasks can also pose independent complexity demands in separate stages of the writing \nprocess depending on whether they require the expression of pre-determined content. The study also \nexplored how a wide range of linguistic variables and automated analyses can be used in \ninvestigations of writing performance. From a theoretical perspective, the indices measuring lexical \ncompetence, clausal complexity and causal cohesion proved to be the most useful in describing task \nand proficiency-related variation. With regard to writing assessment, the findings suggest that in \nautomated assessment, these variables have the potential to distinguish lower and higher levels of \nlanguage competence. The automated analysis exemplified in this study might not only be used in \nhigh-stakes testing contexts but also for self-assessment, which gives learners diagnostic \ninformation with regard to their strengths and weaknesses and can foster learner autonomy in the \nacquisition of FL writing skills. Moreover, several of the performance measures employed in this \n 23 \nstudy, which had previously only been used in the investigations of FL writing, could also be \napplied in the study of L2 speech and yield new insights into how task demands affect cohesion and \nlexical variety and complexity in speech production. \nIn the research reported here, I explored how specific linguistic and discourse characteristics \nof narrative tasks are influenced by aspects of task-complexity in L1 and FL writing. The variable \nwhether students had to narrate a story with a given content or whether they were free to plan the \nplot of the story exerted a major impact only on one measure of lexical sophistication and had a  \nminor effect on the overt expression of temporal cohesion. This indicates that allowing students to \ngenerate their own content in narrative writing tasks does not lead to the avoidance of linguistic \nconstructions that the students do not fully master yet. Given that tasks in which learners have \nfreedom over content might promote the development of textual organization skills and might be \nmore motivating and engaging, writing assessment and pedagogy might give preference to these \ntypes of tasks over those in which students have to narrate predetermined content. \n Our study has also shown that the major difference between L1 and FL writers can be found \nwith relation to lexical variety, sophistication and range. Therefore, our research provides further \nevidence that even at higher levels of L2 competence,  writing classes would not only need to focus \non the improvement of text-level composition skills, but should also include a lexical development \ncomponent. Furthermore, FL writers should be encouraged to use a wider range of complex words \nproductively in their writing through lexically focussed pre-writing and revision tasks.  \n Further research might be necessary to gain more insight into how different task-complexity \ndemands influence the linguistic quality of FL writing in other types of tasks and in additional \ngenres. It would also be important to investigate the interaction of FL proficiency with complexity \ndemands in different types of tasks. A larger and longer sample of writing might also allow for a \nmore detailed analysis of coherence relations in texts and for more sophisticated statistical analysis \nof the data. Further qualitative analyses of cohesive markers and of task-specific linguistic \n 24 \nconstructions that examine variety and accuracy of use could also provide more insight into task- \nand proficiency-related variation in FL writing performance. \n \nReferences \nAlbert, \u00c1.
