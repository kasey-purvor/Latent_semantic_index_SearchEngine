INTRODUCTION \nDetermining the effective electromagnetic (EM) properties of suspensions, dispersions, and \nother heterogeneous materials has been a goal in physics for over 150 years since the early \nstudies of Faraday, Maxwell, and Rayleigh.1,2,3  This goal is important for a fundamental \nunderstanding of wave propagation in random multiphase media, but has remained elusive due to \nstrong multiple scattering between phases with high property contrasts.  Spherical particle \nsuspensions have also been important as model systems for understanding the physics of \ngranular media, amorphous materials, percolation phenomena, and phase transitions,4,5  and a \nthorough understanding of spherical systems serves as a platform for developing more \nsophisticated models for more complex geometries. Additionally, how microstructural changes \nin materials influence their physical properties is a central question in condensed matter physics, \nas is the role of the wavelength of the incident field in resolving microstructural changes at vastly \nsmaller length scales. \nRelating effective properties to material microstructures at multiple scales has received less \nattention due to the complexities and computing power needed to model such systems, yet this \narea of research has many practical applications for remote and in situ material sensing methods, \nmaterials engineering, and bioengineering.  In particular, there is growing interest in the \ndielectric behavior of soils and sediments in the earth sciences.6  Dielectric methods have \nbecome a standard approach for determining soil water content from both in situ measurements \nand remote sensing.7,8  Recently, the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied to \ndetermining earth structure.9  However, researchers are increasingly recognizing that the soil or \nsediment microstructure plays an important role in determining the effective dielectric \nresponse.10,11  For example, particle aggregation has recently been shown to affect the dielectric \n4 \nresponse of soils, which is important as soils vary in their degree of aggregation. Consequently, \nstudies suggest aggregation affects the EM measurement of soil water content.12,13 \n In materials science, vigorous research is being pursued to design composites with new or \nenhanced properties.  Such composites include particle-, fiber-, and whisker-reinforced polymers \nand ceramics; photonic crystals; metamaterials; piezoelectric polymer foams and polymer-\nceramic composites; multifunctional materials combining structural, sensing, actuating, and self-\nrepair capabilities; and nanoscale electronic materials such as magnetoelectric nanocomposites, \ncarbon nanotube composites, and spintronic materials.14-16  Having accurate models for the \neffective permittivity of random media is also critical for the nondestructive evaluation or \nprocess monitoring of composites and mixtures using capacitance measurements, impedance \nspectroscopy, and microwave methods.17,18 \n In biological media, dielectric spectroscopy has been used to measure the effective \npermittivity of cell suspensions and tissues to characterize properties such as yeast cell \nmorphology and cell division.19,20  Modeling the EM field at both the cellular level and at the \nmacroscopic (effective field) level in tissues also has important applications in the assessment of \nthe biological safety of EM fields from sources such as cell phones and power lines, in the \ndetermination of enzyme reaction rates and gene expression in cells exposed to EM fields, in the \ndetection of breast and liver cancer with microwaves, and in radio-frequency and microwave \nablation therapies for tumors.21-24 \nParticle aggregation forms multiscale structures that include mesoscale aggregates or voids in \naddition to the microscale particles.  Thus far the effective properties of these types of materials \nhave yet to be modeled adequately, especially in terms of frequency domain response.  Many \nanalytical formulas have been developed to predict the effective properties of two-phase \n5 \nmixtures comprised of a discontinuous inclusion or particle phase embedded in a continuous \nmatrix phase.4,25-30  Formulas have been derived to model not only isotropically distributed, \nspherical particles but also ellipsoidal particles, layered particles, anisotropic mixtures, and chiral \nmixtures.28,29  These approximations may not adequately model the affects of aggregation and \nhierarchical microstructures in a material since the field interactions are statistically averaged.  In \ncontrast, a numerical approach can calculate the multiple scattering between particles for a \nspecific material microstructure, thereby providing effective properties based on a detailed \nmicroscopic description of the medium and EM field interactions. \n Conventional numerical approaches such as the finite element (FE) and finite-difference \ntime-domain (FDTD) methods have provided benchmark results for the modeling of random \nmedia.30  These methods are currently limited to simple heterogeneous materials, however, and \nare too computationally intensive for modeling large, complex systems such as aggregate and \nhierarchical microstructures.  Since FE and FDTD calculations are challenging even for \nuniformly dispersed mixtures, several methods have been devised to reduce the computational \nburden.  These include the use of small systems, periodic boundary conditions, and two-\ndimensional (2D) models in place of three-dimensional (3D) models.  Several FE models have \ncalculated the permittivity of composites and mixtures by applying periodic boundary conditions \nto a square or cubic unit cell containing a small number (1-134) of  circular,31-35 spherical,31 or \nprismatic inclusions.16   FE calculations have also been combined with the method of boundary-\nintegral equations (BIE) to simulate single inclusions of various shapes, including ellipsoids and \ncylinders, in 2D and 3D unit cells.14  Similarly, the FDTD method has been used to model 2D \nmixtures containing up to 265 inclusions (1.0 inclusion volume fraction),36,37 and to model the \nEM properties of biological tissues using periodic stacks of 30-100 spherical cells;21  Other \n6 \napproaches used to model the permittivity of random media include the transmission line matrix \n(TLM) method, which was applied to 2D simulations of 64-127 inclusions in a square periodic \nunit cell (0.5-1.0 inclusion volume fraction),38 and the lattice Boltzmann method, which used 2D \nsimulations to model fluid aggregation (wetting) in multiphase microporous materials.39 \n Multipole expansion methods are efficient tools for modeling field interactions in arbitrary \n3D configurations of spherical particles since the fields for a particle can be defined by a \nrelatively small number of expansion coefficients rather than a large number of grid values as \nrequired for approaches such as the FE method.  Multipole methods include the iterative \nmultipole approach, the fast multipole method, the T-matrix method, and other matrix methods.40  \nMatrix methods have been limited to the modeling of only a few hundred random particles,41 \nalthough one approach constructed larger quasi-random structures by incorporating these \nparticles into a periodic cell.42  Recently, an iterative multipole approach was developed that \nmodeled the permittivity of up to 3600 monodisperse glass spheres in air.43  The spheres were \nconfigured in either ordered lattices or random microstructures, and with particle volume \nfractions of 0.025-0.60.43 \n This article reports on the use of the iterative multipole approach to study the effects of \nparticle aggregation, multi-level porosity, and hierarchical microstructures on the dielectric \npermittivity of random two-phase mixtures containing monodisperse spheres.  Various levels of \naggregation were simulated where the aggregation formed either large spherical clusters or large \nspherical voids.  Additionally, for each level of aggregation five different microstructural \nvariations were modeled where the particle and cluster\/void locations were changed in order to \ndetermine the standard deviation of the results.  Finally, the numerical results were compared to \nanalytical approximations derived from effective-medium formulas. \n7 \nII. METHODS \nA.  Numerical algorithm \nThe numerical model used an iterative multipole approach that directly simulates multiple \nscattering and calculates the dielectric properties of 3D, arbitrary packings of spherical \nparticles.43  Simulations were performed on particle packs containing up to 2440 particles to \nassess the effects of aggregation (clustering) and foaming (void formation) on random \nmicrostructures.  The spherical particles were configured in a cylinder of fixed volume with the \nEM field propagating parallel to the cylinder\u2019s axis (z direction) and with the electric field vector \nperpendicular to the axis (x direction).  The particles were modeled with a diameter of 200 \u00b5m \nand a permittivity of 8.5 to represent a fine-grained calcareous sediment or soil.44  The matrix \nhad a permittivity of 1.0 to represent either air or vacuum.  The particle packs were constructed \nby Monte Carlo and reduced dimension algorithms for random particle packing.45-47  Aggregate \nmicrostructures with various levels of aggregation (local particle volume fractions) were \ngenerated by defining randomly distributed spherical regions in the pack and altering the particle \nvolume fraction within the region.  Five different structures were simulated for each level of \naggregation to determine the average and standard deviation of the effective permittivity values.  \nThe structures differed in specific particle and cluster\/void locations. \nThe details of the iterative multipole approach have been previously reported for both EM \nand elastic wave scattering.43,48  The EM fields of the spherical particles were modeled with \nvector multipole functions derived from the Maxwell equations for a macroscopic dielectric \nmedium with no free charges.  These functions are solutions to the vector Helmholtz equations in \nspherical coordinates, and are also known as vector spherical wave functions: \n8 \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n+\u2212\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n+=\n+\n+\n\u221e\n=\n+\n\u2212=\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2211 \u2211\n),()(\n12\n),()(\n12\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\u03d5\u03b8\n\u03d5\u03b8\nn\nnmn\nn\nn\nnm\nn\nnmn\nkrz\nn\nni\nkrz\nn\nni\nY\nYV\n,            (1) \n\u2211 \u2211\u221e\n=\n+\n\u2212=\n=\n0\n),()(\nn\nn\nnm\nn\nnmn krz \u03d5\u03b8YW .                (2) \n where ),( \u03d5\u03b8lnmY  is a pure-orbital vector spherical harmonic and )(krzn  is a radial function \nrepresenting a spherical Bessel function [ )(krjn ], a spherical Hankel function of the first kind \n[ )()1( krhn ], or a spherical Hankel function of the second kind [ )(\n)2( krhn ].  The V  and W  vector \nmultipoles are complete and orthogonal multipole expansions for transverse fields.  They are \nsimilar to the vector multipole functions and vector spherical harmonics of Stratton,49 Rose,50 \nEdmonds,51 Greiner and Maruhn,52 and Jackson.53  To be consistent with the Maxwell equations, \nthe conventional electric and magnetic fields ( E  and H , respectively) are related to V  and W  \nas follows: \n[ ]\u2211 \u2211\u221e\n=\n+\n\u2212=\n+=\n0\n)()()(\nn\nn\nnm\nnmnmnmnm BA rWrVrE ,             (3) \n[ ]\u2211 \u2211\u221e\n=\n+\n\u2212=\n+\u2212=\n0\n)()()(\nn\nn\nnm\nnmnmnmnm ABi rWrVrH \u03b7 ,            (4) \nwhere \u03b7  is the index of refraction ( \u00b5\u03b5\u03b7 = ) and nmA  and nmB  are arbitrary coefficients.  The \nvector multipole definitions of Greiner and Maruhn specify kAnm = , ikBnm = , and 1=\u03b7 .52  \nSince the electric and magnetic fields were given a time dependence of tie \u03c9\u2212  for the derivation of \nthe vector multipoles, the radial functions will be spherical Hankel functions of the second kind \nfor the incident waves, spherical Bessel functions for the interior waves, and spherical Hankel \nfunctions of the first kind for the scattered waves.43 \n9 \nIn the simulations, an EM field is imposed on the cylindrical particle pack and the resultant \nfield interactions within the pack calculated.  The imposed field is modeled as a plane wave that \nis expanded into vector multipole functions with the use of partial-wave expansions: \n[ ]1,1,1,1,)12( \u2212\u2212++ \u2212+++= \u2211 nnnn\nn\nnikz\nx nie VWVWe \u03c0 ,         (5) \n[ ]1,1,1,1,)12()( \u2212\u2212++ +\u2212++\u2212= \u2211 nnnn\nn\nnikz\ny niie VWVWe \u03c0 .        (6) \nNote that the partial-wave expansions for the incident plane waves use multipole functions with \nspherical Bessel functions for the radial dependence rather than spherical Hankel functions of the \nsecond kind. \nTo simulate multiple scattering in a suspension of spherical particles, the iterative multipole \napproach calculates the Mie scattering solutions for the individual spheres for an arbitrary \nincident wave field.  The scattered wave fields from each sphere are then transformed to the \ncoordinate systems of the other spheres using vector addition theorems for spherical wave \nfunctions.  The vector addition theorems expand the multipole moments of one sphere in terms \nof the multipole moments of another sphere, and have the following form: \n( )\u2211 \u2211\u221e\n= \u2212=\n+=\u2032\n0n\nn\nnm\nnm\nnm\nnm\nnm TS WVV \u03bd\u00b5\u03bd\u00b5\u03bd\u00b5 ,               (7) \n( )\u2211 \u2211\u221e\n= \u2212=\n+=\u2032\n0n\nn\nnm\nnm\nnm\nnm\nnm TS VWW \u03bd\u00b5\u03bd\u00b5\u03bd\u00b5 ,               (8) \nwhere nmV  and nmW  are wave fields scattered from the originating sphere (designated \u03b1  with \ncoordinates \u03b1r , \u03b1\u03b8 , and \u03b1\u03d5 ), and \u03bd\u00b5V\u2032  and \u03bd\u00b5W\u2032  are the same wave fields incident on a second \nsphere (designated \u03b2  with coordinates \u03b2r , \u03b2\u03b8 , and \u03b2\u03d5 ).  Since the scattered wave fields nmV  \nand nmW  are outgoing, their radial dependence is represented with a Hankel function of the first \n10 \nkind.  However, the incident wave fields \u03bd\u00b5V\u2032  and \u03bd\u00b5W\u2032  are represented by a spherical Bessel \nfunction in a manner similar to the partial wave expansions.  The translation coefficients nmS\u03bd\u00b5  \nand nmT\u03bd\u00b5  are the following: \nmnnnm ZS ,, ,, \u00b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bd\u00b5 = ,                    (9) \nmnnnm ZiT ,, ,,1\n12\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03bd\u00b5 \u03bd\n\u03bd\n+\n+= ,                 (10) \nwhere \n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\u00d7\n+\n++\u00d7\n\u03a6\u0398\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7=\n\u2211\n\u2211\n\u2212=\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212+\n\u2212=\n1\n1\n,\n,,,\n,\n,1,,\n,\n,1,,\n0,\n0,,0,\n,\n)1(,,\n,,\n12\n)12)(12(4\n),()()(\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u00b5\u03c4\u00b5\u03bb\n\u00b5\u03bd\n\u03c4\u03c4\u00b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03bb\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bb\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\n\u03bb\u03c0\nml\nmp\nmn\nml\nl\np\nmpp\npl\nl\nlp\nmnl\nCCC\nl\npC\nYkRhiZ R\n.        (11) \nHere, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 RRR \u2212= , where \u03b1R  and \u03b2R  are the position vectors for the two spheres with \nrespect to a common origin.  The C symbols are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.  The vector \naddition theorems and corresponding translation coefficients can be calculated using recurrence \nformulas that significantly reduce the number of operations for their computation.54,55  A more \nconcise form for Eq. (11) is found in Fuller and Mackowski.56 \nThe vector addition theorems couple the electromagnetic interactions between all of the \nspheres in the simulated sphere packing, and therefore form a set of linear equations linking the \ninteractions between all p particles.  Since a particular multipole moment from each sphere is \nexpanded in terms of a sum of multipole moments at each of the other spheres, all of the \nmultipole moments will be coupled as well and will require simultaneous solution.  This \ncoupling of multipole moments is in contrast to Mie scattering from a single spherical particle, \n11 \nwhere all of the multipole moments are decoupled and can be solved independently to obtain the \nscattered wave field amplitudes.  For multiple-scattering from p particles with maxn  multipole \nmoments, where maxn  is the maximum multipole expansion order computed, there will be \n2\nmax )1( +n  moments for each particle coupled to 2max )1( +n  moments for every other particle.  \nThe resulting set of linear equations therefore has 2max )1( +np  equations each with 2max )1( +np  \nterms, producing a matrix with 4max\n2 )1( +np  elements.  Even for modest values of p and maxn  \n(e.g., 100\u2248p  and 10max \u2248n ) this set of equations is numerically challenging.  This study \ntherefore employed an iteration process to solve the multiple-scattering matrix equations. \nMultiple scattering was simulated by updating the incident field on each particle with the \nscattered wave field contributions from the other particles.  The Mie scattering from each particle \nwas then recalculated and translated to the other particles to update the incident fields in an \niterative process.  This process was repeated until the wave fields converged to a user-specified \ntolerance.  Each iteration step therefore represented an order of scattering, with no iteration (no \nmultiple scattering) representing zero-order or single scattering, the first iteration representing \nfirst-order scattering, and so forth.  Most of the simulations converged by the second iteration \nstep with a convergence tolerance of 10-6 (i.e., a subsequent solution varied from the preceding \nsolution by less than 10-6).  Although the iterations are computed sequentially in time, the actual \nmultiple-scattering process itself is time independent.  This is equivalent to the direct, \nsimultaneous solution of the entire set of 2max )1( +np  linear equations.  The zero-order \nscattering, first-order scattering, and so forth therefore represent increasingly accurate degrees of \napproximation to the multiple scattering solution, and not a time-dependent process. \n12 \nAll of the simulations were computed to a maximum multipole expansion order of 7max =n , \nwhich has been shown to be necessary for convergence of the solutions by previous convergence \nstudies on random and ordered particle packs.43  The rapid convergence of the computations can \nbe attributed to the small (200 \u00b5m) diameter of the particles as compared to the wavelengths of \nthe 0.01-10.0 GHz EM fields.  These values correspond to size parameters of 2\u00d710-5 to 2\u00d710-2.  \nThe size parameter is defined as \u03bb\u03c0 a2 , where a is the particle radius and \u03bb is the EM field \nwavelength.  Although the size parameters are within the Rayleigh scattering approximation for \nsingle spheres and therefore suggest only small values (< 7) are required for maxn , previous \nstudies have demonstrated that higher maxn  values are necessary when multiple scattering is \ninvolved.43  Computer algorithms for the model were written and compiled in FORTRAN 90 \nwith double precision.  Simulations were performed on a personal desktop computer with 2.0 \ngigabytes random access memory and a 3.2-GHz processor. \nThe effective permittivity was calculated by averaging the E  and D  fields over a \nrepresentative volume containing the particles and matrix, and then taking the ratio of the \nvolume-averaged fields: \nE\nD=eff\u03b5  .                    (12) \nThe averaging was performed by evaluating the E  and D  fields on a uniformly spaced three-\ndimensional grid containing 653,50373 =  points.  For non-aggregated particle suspensions the \nevaluation grid comprised a cube containing approximately 70 particles (0.10 vol. fraction) to \n420 particles (0.60 vol. fraction).  Since the electric field was polarized in the x direction in the \nsimulations, only the x components of the electric field and electric displacement were used to \ncompute the effective permittivity.  This was equivalent to the use of a parallel-plate capacitor \n13 \nfor measuring the dielectric constant, and provided results physically comparable to experimental \nmethods.43 \nThe volume of the cubic evaluation grid comprised 2.5% of the volume of the cylindrical \npacking of spheres (cube edge length = 0.27 pack diameter).  The simulation results were not \nindependent of the cube volume or position.  Decreasing the cube volume increased the \nvariability of the results since local fields within and around the particles were sampled to an \nincreasing extent.  These local field effects were particularly strong for aggregated particle \npacks.  Increasing the cube volume increased edge effects due to the boundary of the particle \npack which introduced greater error into the computations.  Similarly, placing the cube near the \nsides of the particle pack also increased edge effects.  The volume and position of the evaluation \ngrid was therefore optimized in a previous study to minimize variation and maximize accuracy \nby comparing simulations of ordered particle packings to exact lattice models.43  The cube \nvolume was determined to simultaneously minimize local field effects and edge effects, whereas \nthe cube was positioned at the center of the particle pack to minimize edge effects and maximize \nthe electric field uniformity. \n \nB. Effective medium models \nAs a comparison for the simulation results, macroscopic permittivities for aggregate \nmicrostructures were also calculated using effective-medium models.  The effective-medium \nmodels were constructed from successive application of effective-medium formulas originally \nderived for microstructures with uniformly distributed particles [Fig. 1(a)].  For cluster \naggregation, the particle clusters were modeled as single, large quasi-particles comprised of the \nsmaller particles [Fig. 1(b)].  An effective permittivity was first calculated for the interior of the \n14 \nquasi-particle by treating it as a medium with uniformly distributed particles.  Since the particles \nwithin the quasi-particle had a higher volume fraction than the average volume fraction for the \nmaterial due to their aggregation, the permittivity for the quasi-particle was different than that for \nthe medium as a whole.  The macroscopic permittivity for the medium was then obtained by \napplying the effective-medium formula to the quasi-particles in the air matrix.  In this case, the \nquasi-particles were modeled as solid particles with the quasi-permittivity as calculated in the \nfirst step and with a quasi-volume fraction (volume fraction of clusters in medium). \nA similar approach was used to model the aggregation of particles to form large spherical \nvoids (foaming).  In this case, a quasi-matrix was modeled as a medium uniformly filled with the \nparticles [Fig. 1(c)].  The effective-medium formula was first applied to the interior of the quasi-\nmatrix to obtain its effective permittivity.  Again, the particles within the quasi-matrix displayed \na higher volume fraction than the average volume fraction for the material, yielding a \npermittivity different from that of the medium as a whole.  Finally, the quasi-matrix was \nmodeled as a solid matrix with a quasi-permittivity, a quasi-volume fraction, and large spherical \nvoids to obtain the macroscopic permittivity of the medium. \nThe first effective-medium model was generated from the Maxwell Garnett equation:25 \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\u2212+\n\u2212+=\n)(2\n3\n0101\n01\n00 \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\nf\nfeff  .            (13) \nThe inclusion (particle or void), matrix, and effective permittivities are 1\u03b5 , 0\u03b5 , and eff\u03b5 , \nrespectively.  The inclusion volume fraction is f .  Equation (13) has been characterized as a \nfirst-order approximation accounting for dipole-dipole interactions between particles in the \nsuspension, and is extensively used to this day for many scattering and effective medium \ncalculations across many fields of application.29  However, multipole computations of up to 3600 \n15 \nparticles have shown that the Maxwell Garnett equation provides results most consistent with a \nsingle-scattering model having no particle-particle interactions.43  Equation (13) can therefore be \nregarded as only a zero-order approximation. \nThe second effective-medium model was generated from an equation derived by Torquato.26  \nThis equation originates from a microstructure-dependent model based on a perturbation \nexpansion of the polarization that yields a set of microstructure-dependent parameters known as \npoint probability functions.  Truncation of the expansion provides the following approximate \nformula for three-dimensional microstructures: \n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212+= 2\n2\n0 )1(21\n)1(221\n\u03b6\u03b4\u03b4\n\u03b6\u03b4\u03b4\u03b5\u03b5\nff\nff\neff .              (14) \nThe microstructure-dependent three-point parameter \u03b6  is a function of f .  The parameter \u03b4  is \n01\n01\n2\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b4 +\n\u2212= .                    (15) \nTorquato provides three-point parameter values for f  = 0.10-0.60 for random microstructures of \nimpenetrable spheres.26  Note that the Maxwell-Garnett equation was originally formulated to \ncalculate the effective properties (conductivity, permittivity, etc.) of media containing uniformly \ndistributed inclusions [Fig. 1(a)], whereas the Torquato equation is capable of modeling higher-\norder microstructures [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] for properly calculated \u03b6 parameters.  For this study, \nthe \u03b6 parameters for uniformly random particle packs as calculated in Ref. 26 were used to \nconstruct the effective medium model.  Although \u03b6 parameters and corresponding Torquato \nmodels can be directly constructed for aggregated microstructures, this initial study did not \naddress these models. \n \n16 \nIII. RESULTS \nThe effects of the level of particle aggregation on effective permittivity were determined by \nkeeping the average particle volume fraction constant in the medium and modeling the \npermittivity as a function of local particle volume fraction in the cluster or foam wall.  For \nexample, Fig. 2 displays simulated foam-type microstructures of 1,212 particles.  The \nmicrostructure initially had a uniform distribution and average volume fraction of 0.30 [Fig. \n2(a)].  The level of particle aggregation was increased in subsequent microstructures by \nincreasing the void size and the corresponding local particle volume fraction to 40% [Fig. 2(b)], \n50% [Fig. 2(c)], and 60% [Fig. 2(d)].  Average particle volume fractions of 0.20 and 0.30 were \nused for this study, similar to highly dual porous media,12 with the local particle volume fractions \nhaving a maximum of 0.50 and 0.60, respectively.  For comparison, the volume fraction for a \nmaximally random jammed packing of hard monodisperse spheres is ~0.64-0.65.57 \nFigure 3 displays grayscale plots of the 10-MHz microscopic electric field amplitudes for the \nfoam-type microstructures shown in Fig. 2.  The plots reveal low field strengths within the \nparticles, intermediate field strengths in the large void regions, and high field strengths between \nclosely spaced particles.  The plots also reveal that the range of electric field amplitudes \nincreases with increasing aggregation.  Table 1 shows the range of electric field amplitudes as a \nfunction of local particle-volume fraction, with increasing volume fraction proportional to degree \nof aggregation (no aggregation for 0.30; maximum aggregation for 0.60).  The results indicate \nthat aggregation increases microscopic field amplitudes, probably due to the increased localized \npacking of particles. \nFigure 4 shows the effective permittivities at 10 MHz for cluster-type and foam-type \nmicrostructures constructed from a Monte Carlo algorithm45  and with an average particle \n17 \nvolume fraction of 0.30.  All three models predicted that foaming of the microstructure increases \nthe effective permittivity for 01 \u03b5\u03b5 > .  The model results disagreed, however, for cluster \naggregation.  While the Maxwell Garnett model showed no change in permittivity due to \nclustering, the Torquato model showed an increase in permittivity with local particle volume \nfraction.  In contrast, the multipole model showed a 3.1 \u00b1 1.4% decrease in effective permittivity \nfor clustering with a highly significant probability (R = -0.75 for 15 simulations).  R is the \ncoefficient of linear correlation defined by the covariance divided by the standard deviations: \n( )( )\n( ) ( )\u2211\u2211\n\u2211\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212==\n22 yyxx\nyyxx\nR\nii\nii\nyx\nxy\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n.             (16) \nThe multipole model also displayed a 3.0 \u00b1 1.6% increase for foaming, but with only a \nsignificant correlation (R = 0.53; 20 simulations). \nTo verify the 0.30 volume fraction results for the multipole model, cluster and foam \nsimulations were also performed for a constant average volume fraction of 0.20 and using \nparticle packs constructed from a different algorithm (reduced dimension).46,47  The results, Fig. \n5, show the same trends as in Fig. 4, but with much smaller standard deviations in the 10-MHz \npermittivity values.  For cluster-type aggregation the effective permittivity decreased by 3.2 \u00b1 \n0.2%, whereas for foam-type aggregation the effective permittivity increased by 1.3 \u00b1 0.4% \n(note that the foam simulations only went to 0.4 local particle volume fraction as compared to \n0.5 for the cluster simulations).  The smaller deviations can be attributed to a larger number of \nparticles used in the 0.20 simulations (\u223c2400) than for the 0.30 simulations (\u223c1200).  The smaller \ndeviations yield much higher correlation results for both aggregation (R = -0.98; 15 simulations) \nand foaming (R = 0.90; 15 simulations).  The results for the Maxwell Garnett model at 0.20 \nvolume fraction are also shown for comparison. \n18 \nFigure 6 shows the effects of aggregation on effective permittivity for a medium where the \ndielectric constants have been reversed between the particles and matrix ( 1\u03b5  = 1.0 and 0\u03b5  = 8.5, \nrespectively).  This \u201creverse-constant\u201d medium is essentially that of spherical voids in a solid \nmatrix, and the behavior of the effective permittivity is reversed as well when compared to the \nbehavior of a \u201cnormal\u201d medium (solid particles in air or vacuum).  Clustering of the voids \nincreased the permittivity by 2.2 \u00b1 0.07% with a highly significant correlation (R = 0.98; 15 \nsimulations).  Foaming of the voids decreased the permittivity by 0.84 \u00b1 0.33% with a significant \ncorrelation (R = -0.85; 15 simulations).  The Maxwell Garnett model for the reverse-constant \nmedium agrees well with the multipole simulations for foaming, but strongly disagrees with the \nsimulations for clustering. \nThe results from both the effective medium models and the multipole model were consistent \nin showing increases in the effective permittivity of particle aggregates with foam-type \nmicrostructures.  The results between the models were not consistent, however, for particle \naggregates with cluster-type microstructures.  Since the multipole model directly computes the \neffective permittivity from multiple-scattering interactions in the particle pack, its results are \nexpected to be more reliable than those from the effective-medium approximations that use the \nMaxwell Garnett and Torquato formulas that only provide an estimate of the multiple-scattering \neffects.  The high degree of statistical significance and correlation for the multipole simulation \nresults in Figs. 4-6 supports this conclusion. \nIn addition to the 10-MHz (0.01-GHz) simulations, simulations were also performed on the \n0.20-volume fraction particle packs at 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 GHz to determine the effect of \nfrequency on the aggregation-induced permittivity values.  The results, Fig. 7, show very little \nchange in the effective permittivity values as a function of frequency.  The only significant \n19 \nchange is a slight decrease between 1.0 and 10.0 GHz.  However, this decrease represents only a \n1% drop in permittivity, and is independent of the degree of aggregation.  Since the scattering \ninteractions are dependent on the product of the EM field wave vector and scatterer size [kr in \nEqs. (1) and (2)], an increase or decrease in the wavelength of the incident wave can be viewed \nas a decrease or increase in the scale of the scattering heterogeneities of a medium, respectively.  \nSince the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the EM wave field, Fig. 7 \ntherefore indicates a significant degree of scale invariance of the permittivity as a function of the \nsize of the aggregate (heterogeneity) length scale. \n \nIV. DISCUSSION \nA.  Comparison of results \nDeviations between the results for the Maxwell Garnett, Torquato, and iterative multipole \nmodels were expected since previous studies with ordered and random microstructures had \nshown large deviations as well.43  In the previous studies, the model predictions were compared \nto those from (1) exact lattice models that used symmetry and periodicity to provide exact \nsolutions for the permittivities and (2) experimental measurements of random glass sphere \npackings in air.  The results showed that the multipole simulations and Torquato model were in \ngreater agreement with the exact lattice models and experimental measurements than the \nMaxwell Garnett model.  The Maxwell Garnett model was more in agreement with single-\nscattering results (no multiple scattering), and was therefore concluded to be only a zero-order \napproximation since it did not account for particle-particle interactions or microstructure. \nThe results for the reverse-constant medium (voids in a solid matrix) are physically \nconsistent with those for a normal medium (solid particles in air or vacuum).  As the voids \n20 \naggregate, they form void clusters that are analogous to the large voids of a normal foam \nmicrostructure with solid particles.  Both clustering in the reverse-constant medium (Fig. 6) and \nfoaming in the normal medium (Fig. 5) therefore display an increase in the effective permittivity.  \nSimilarly, foaming in the reverse-constant medium creates large, spherical regions of solid \nmatrix material that are analogous to the clusters of solid particle in a normal medium.  \nTherefore, both foaming in the reverse-constant medium (Fig. 5) and clustering in the normal \nmedium (Fig. 6) exhibit a decrease in the effective permittivity. \nIn this study, the disagreement between the Torquato and multipole results can be attributed \nto the assumption used in the two-level effective-medium model developed from the Torquato \nequation.  This assumption was that the local permittivity of the quasi-particle or quasi-matrix \ncould be calculated using the local particle volume fraction within the quasi-particle or matrix \nand assuming it was a separate, infinite medium.  However, local geometric effects due to the \nfinite sizes of the quasi-particles or voids within the quasi-matrix would be neglected with this \napproximation.  In contrast, the multipole method directly calculated the field interactions from \nall of the particle locations in the medium, thus providing a more accurate simulation of \naggregation effects.  No effective-medium assumptions were used in the multipole method, so \nthe effects of the aggregation geometry (cluster and void sizes) were modeled more accurately.  \nValidation of the multipole results with experimental data will be required, however, to test the \naccuracy of the model and more fully understand the effects of aggregation on effective \npermittivity in particulate media. Given the sensitivity of current measurement methods, this \nremains a considerable challenge. \n \n21 \nB.  Multiscale or hierarchical porosity structures \nAggregation of monodisperse spheres creates microstructures with multiscale or hierarchical \nporosity structures.  In this study, dual-porosity structures were produced for cluster and foam \naggregation.  The large-scale level of porosity consisted of the regions between the particle \nclusters or within the large spherical voids of the particle foam.  The small-scale level of porosity \nconsisted of the interparticle regions within the clusters or foam walls.  The results of the \nnumerical model indicate that these multiscale or hierarchical microstructures affect the effective \npermittivity of heterogeneous materials.  This conclusion is relevant for measurements of media \nthat may undergo microstructural alterations such as soils (aggregation of soil grains), fluids in \nsedimentary rocks (differential wetting at different porosity scales), composites (particle \naggregation during manufacture), biological tissues (tissue remodeling due to neoplasms and \nother pathologies), and fluid suspensions (flocculation, etc.). \nCluster-type aggregation forms large quasi-particles with small-scale porosity within the \nquasi-particle.  This type of microstructure is comparable to a dual-porosity microstructure \ncomprised of random, uniformly distributed solid particles with small, internal, spherical voids.  \nBecause of this similarity, we would expect the effective permittivity of the particles with \ninternal voids to be similar to that of cluster aggregation and therefore lower than that of a simple \nrandom microstructure for an equal solid volume fraction [Fig. 1(a)].  To test this hypothesis, the \nnumerical model was applied to a random microstructure of particles containing internal voids.  \nUsing the multipole simulations, an effective permittivity for the particles was first calculated for \nspherical voids within the solid particle phase.  This permittivity was then used for the particles \nto calculate the effective permittivity of the total particle pack.  The computational results \nshowed a 1.4% decrease in overall effective permittivity with an increase in internal porosity of 0 \n22 \nto 0.60 volume fraction pores (constant 0.30 solid volume fraction).  The numerical results \ndisagreed with those from an effective-medium model based on the Maxwell Garnett equation, \nhowever, which showed an increase in effective permittivity of 11% for the same increase in \npore volume fraction. \n \nC.  Proposed mechanisms \nThree theories are proposed to explain the changes in permittivity with aggregation in this \nstudy.  The first theory involves a waveguide-like mechanism where the wave fields are \nconcentrated to a greater degree in specific regions of the heterogeneous structures.  The speed of \nEM wave propagation in a medium is inversely proportional to the square root of its permittivity.  \nOn a microscopic scale, spatial variations in the local permittivity of a complex medium will lead \nto spatial variations in the wave propagation behavior and produce phenomena such as wave \nguiding, wave trapping, and photonic band gaps.  These propagation anomalies will give rise to \nchanges in the effective permittivity.  Similarly, the microscopic propagation behavior of EM \nfields in an aggregated material will be a function of the level and type of particle aggregation, \nand will influence the material\u2019s effective permittivity. \nAggregation in random particle suspensions produces a quasi-continuous phase (e.g., the \nquasi-matrix in Fig. 1) of higher or lower particle density, thus higher or lower permittivity, in \nthe medium.  The simulations indicate that the effective permittivity changes in aggregated \nmicrostructures follow the same trends as the local permittivity changes in the quasi-continuous \nphase.  The quasi-continuous phase thus appears to function as a preferred path for wave field \npropagation due to its continuity through the microstructure.  The resultant macroscopic wave \n23 \nfield propagation and effective permittivity therefore reflects the wave guiding influence and \nlocal permittivity of the aggregation paths in the suspension. \nFor foam-type microstructures, the particles condense to form continuous paths where the \nparticle volume fractions are greater than in the rest of the suspension.  These paths therefore \nhave wave field velocities less than the uniform random structure due to the higher permittivities \nof the particles, and also function as waveguides for wave field propagation through the particle \nsuspension due to their continuity or connectivity.  Since the wave field velocities are less in the \npaths than in the non-aggregated microstructure, the effective permittivity for foam-type \naggregation increases. \nSimilarly for cluster-type microstructures, the interstitial voids condense to form continuous \npaths where the particle volume fractions are less than in the rest of the suspension.  These paths \ntherefore have wave field velocities greater than the uniform random structure due to the lower \npermittivity of the matrix (air or vacuum).  Again, the paths function as waveguides for wave \nfield propagation through the particle suspension due to their continuity or connectivity.  Since \nthe wave field velocities are greater in the paths than in the non-aggregated microstructure, the \neffective permittivity for cluster-type aggregation decreases. \nA second theory attributes the simulation results to a percolation-like mechanism.  This \nmechanism is also consistent with the simulation results for the aggregated suspensions, and is \nanalogous to electrical conduction in amorphous and granular systems resulting from tunneling \npercolation.  In this theory, higher permittivities are expected for foam microstructures because \nof the continuous paths of the closely spaced particles of high-permittivity (similar to a path of \nstepping stones), whereas lower permittivities are predicted for cluster microstructures because \nthe clusters isolate the high-permittivity particles and do not provide continuous paths.  The \n24 \ndifference between the proposed mechanism and percolation in conductive systems is the \nabsence of a percolation threshold.  This is because wave field propagation through a random \nparticle suspension relies on the local particle density (volume fraction), which is continuous, \nand not on particle-to-particle contacts, which are discrete.  Although percolation theory was \ndeveloped to model electrical conduction in conductor-insulator systems, it has been extended to \nother macroscopic properties including elasticity and viscous fluid flow.58  The application of \npercolation-like processes to the dielectric properties of complex media may therefore provide \nnew insights into the physics of these systems, and may offer new models for other physical \nsystems such as amorphous materials or elastic wave fields in heterogeneous materials. \nTunneling percolation is a particularly interesting analog for modeling the dielectric \npermittivity of aggregated microstructures.  In this approach, virtual charges are envisioned as \ntunneling from one particle to the next to emulate the multipole interactions and polarization \neffects in heterogeneous materials.  Like the probability of conduction tunneling in a particulate \nsystem, multipole fields also decrease with distance from the particle.  However, whereas \nconduction tunneling drops off exponentially, multipole fields exhibit a power-law drop.59-62  \nAlso, instead of electrons tunneling from one inclusion to the next as in standard percolation \nmodels, in the dielectric case polarization charges would appear to tunnel from one inclusion to \nthe next.  Therefore, polarization effects would propagate more strongly in microstructures with \nclosely spaced particles in quasi-continuous paths as in Fig. 1(c), and the effective permittivity \nwould be higher.  Conversely, the intercluster distances between the particles in cluster-type \naggregation, Fig. 1(b), would limit the tunneling of polarization charges and thus suppress the \nmultipole interactions.  The permittivity would therefore be more representative of the \nbackground matrix between the clusters. \n25 \nA third mechanism for the simulation results is that the second-order microstructures in the \naggregated suspensions\u2014the particle clusters or large voids\u2014give rise to collective polarization \neffects that enhance or diminish the background polarization field arising from the first-order \nmicrostructure (uniformly random suspension).  These polarization effects would be similar to \nthe asymmetry predicted by the Maxwell Garnett equation [Eq. (13)], where voids in a solid \nmatrix produce higher effective permittivities than solid particles in an air\/vacuum matrix for the \nsame solid volume fraction.  For the aggregated structures, collective polarization effects would \ncause the particle clusters to behave as quasi-particles and the large voids to behave as quasi-\nvoids (Fig. 1).  Collective polarization effects may also be responsible for the waveguide-like \nbehavior, where enhanced polarization on the boundaries between the second-order \nmicrostructures (quasi-particles and quasi-matrix) would concentrate the EM field in the quasi-\nmatrix. \nInterestingly, the changes in permittivity with aggregation observed in this study mirror those \nof ordered arrays of particles.  Exact theory and multipole simulations both show that simple-\ncubic (sc) lattices and random packings have higher permittivities than body-centered-cubic \n(bcc), face-centered-cubic (fcc), and hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) lattices for packings of equal \nvolume fraction.43  Since sc lattices and maximally random packings have a lower coordination \nnumber (6) than bcc (8), fcc (12), and hcp (12) lattices, the particles in these structures will be \n11% (compared to fcc and hcp) to 17% (compared to bcc) closer to their nearest neighbors for \nequal volume-fraction packings.  This creates a more open, foam-like structure for the sc and \nrandom structures, with larger interstices and void spaces than the bcc, fcc, or hcp lattices.  \nAdditionally, the closer particles create more defined pathways for a waveguide or percolation-\nlike mechanism.  The permittivities for the sc and random structures are therefore \n26 \ncorrespondingly higher.  The greatest difference in permittivity is between the sc and bcc lattices, \nwhich also show the greatest difference in nearest neighbor distances (17%).  More open lattice \nstructures are also possible such as the diamond lattice for particles with a coordination number \nof 4.  Note that several solid electrolytes such as cubic ZrO2 have a fluorite crystal structure, a \nderivative of the diamond structure.  These crystals have an open, foam-like structure that \nprovides channels for the diffusion of oxygen. \n \nD.  Applicability of the quasistatic limit \nThe simulation results showed that subtle changes in microstructure produced statistically \nsignificant changes in the effective permittivity for random suspensions of spheres, even though \nthe particle diameters and corresponding aggregation structures were 2-5 orders of magnitude \nsmaller than the incident field wavelength in free space (30 m for 10-MHz waves to 3 cm for 10-\nGHz waves).  This conclusion runs counter to a commonly accepted interpretation of the \nquasistatic limit.  This interpretation holds that a composite can be considered homogeneous if \nthe length scales of the heterogeneities are much smaller than the wavelength of EM field.31  \nThis interpretation is equivalent to the Rayleigh assumption of uniform field strength.  The \nquasistatic limit has also been used to argue that EM scattering will not be significant in \nheterogeneous media at long wavelengths, and thus the EM field will be insensitive to \nmicrostructural variations at the size scale of the inclusions.36,37  However, the aggregation \nresults in this study showed that small changes in microstructure affected macroscopic properties \nin the quasistatic limit, although the macroscopic composition (average particle volume fraction) \nremained constant.  Additionally, the simulation results were by and large insensitive to the scale \nof the heterogeneities with respect to the incident field wavelength. \n27 \nThe results of this study show that the uniform field strength assumption may not be valid for \nthe dielectric properties of many ordinary microstructures, and its use should be carefully \nscrutinized for future research in this area.  The effects of subtle microstructural changes such as \naggregation also indicate the importance of accounting for all of the collective interparticle \ninteractions (scattering) with a level of detail beyond that of conventional effective medium \ntheories [Eqs. (13) and (14)].  Multipole simulations of soot particle clusters in the electrostatic \nlimit have also shown that particle-particle interactions with multipole orders higher than the \nRayleigh-limit dipole are necessary to accurately predict the optical absorption properties of the \nclusters.63 \n \nE.  Applications \nInterest in wave propagation in heterogeneous media has grown over the past decades due to \nthe development of remote and in situ sensing methods for geophysics, medical physics, \nnondestructive evaluation, space exploration, and other fields of science and technology.  \nRelating effective properties such as the permittivity to the material microstructure is crucial to \nevaluating sensor data and extracting information about the interrogated medium.  Additionally, \nthe development of new composites with novel or enhanced properties has spurred efforts to \npredict the properties of heterogeneous media and engineer their microstructures to optimize \nthese new effects.14 \nThe iterative multipole approach used in this study is a very efficient and direct method for \nsimulating the multiple-scattering interactions of EM fields in suspensions of spherical particles. \nThe modeling permits analysis of material response that is difficult or impossible with current \nexperimental methods.  The approach is amenable to the simulation of particles with \n28 \npolydisperse sizes and properties, and in arbitrary microstructures including ordered, random, \nand hierarchical configurations.43,64,65  Simulations of materials with structured (layered or with \ninternal inclusions) and nonspherical (spheroidal) particles are also feasible with the iterative \nmultipole approach.56,64-66  The iterative multipole approach may therefore provide a crucial link \nbetween microscopic structure and macroscopic properties for model-based signal analysis tools. \nAlthough the changes in effective permittivity calculated by the simulation models appear \nsmall and bounded by \u00b13%, the ability to predict these variations in material properties due to \nmicrostructure may be helpful in establishing expected variances in measurements, in \ndetermining the accuracy of data interpretations, and in predicting material property variations in \ncomposites.  The largest permittivity differences are approximately 6% observed between \nmaximally aggregated foam and cluster microstructures.  Although not large when compared \nwith other factors that impact remote sensing or composite properties, it is expected that this \neffect will become more pronounced in suspensions with non-spherical particles.  The \nsimulations in this work therefore provide the fundamental groundwork for further study on \nmore complex geometries, especially in the frequency domain, and may lead to new applications \nof microwave measurement methods to determine material properties.  Additionally, \nunderstanding this source of variation in the data will contribute to our understanding of the \nsources of noise in remote sensing and geophysical data, as well as material property variability \nin composites  Finally, if complementary measurements are available that can provide \ninformation on a material\u2019s composition, density, and particle size distribution, multipole \nsimulations may be able to provide sufficient accuracy to predict the material\u2019s microstructure \nwith a high degree of confidence. \n \n29 \nV.  CONCLUSIONS \nAnalytical methods for approximating the material properties of particle-filled media, such as \nthe dielectric properties of soil, assume a uniform, random particle distribution.  To determine \nwhat effect microstructure, and specifically aggregation, has on the effective physical properties \nof a particle pack, a multipole computer model was used to simulate wave propagation and \nscattering in simulated non-uniform packings of monodisperse spheres.  Two types of \naggregation were examined, aggregates with a cluster-type microstructure and aggregates with a \nfoam-type microstructure.  The test packs contained approximately equal numbers of particles \nwith varying degrees of aggregation.  It was found that the foam-type microstructures had \nconsistently higher dielectric properties than uniform packings, while the cluster-type \nmicrostructures had properties that were consistently lower.  The effective permittivity changed \nby +3.0% (foam-type aggregation) and \u20133.1% (cluster-type aggregation) at maximum \naggregation (local particle volume fraction of 0.60 in aggregated regions).  The simulations \nadditionally showed that the ranges for the microscopic electric field values in the particle packs \nincreased with greater aggregation. \nTwo-stage effective-medium models were also developed for comparison to the multipole \nmodel results.  The effective-medium models displayed trends for foams that were consistent \nwith the multipole models, showing an increasing effective permittivity.  They were not \nconsistent for clusters, however, showing increasing or constant effective permittivities whereas \nthe multipole models displayed decreasing trends.  The disagreement between the models is due \nin part to the assumption in the first stage of the effective-medium models that calculates the \npermittivity of the aggregated region (cluster or foam matrix) by assuming it is an infinite \nmedium with the local particle volume fraction. \n30 \nThe effective permittivity changes in aggregated microstructures can be attributed to one of \nthree processes.  The first process is a waveguide-like mechanism of preferred wave field \npropagation through the quasi-continuous phase that forms paths of higher or lower particle \ndensity, thus higher or lower permittivity, through the medium.  The increase or decrease in \neffective permittivity therefore parallels the increase or decrease in local permittivity of the \ncontinuous matrix network, but is opposite to the local permittivity changes in the particle \nclusters (cluster-type aggregation) or large voids (foam-type aggregation).  The second process is \na percolation-type mechanism that views the multipole interactions as a type of tunneling \nphenomenon where polarization charges tunnel, in a virtual sense, from one particle to another in \nthe presence of an external electric field.  This process links the particle-to-particle multipole \ninteractions to the multiscale heterogeneity of the microstructure.  The percolation-like process is \nsimilar to tunneling percolation in conductor-insulator systems, but lacks a critical threshold \nsince it is a function of particle volume fraction, which is continuous.  The third mechanism \nascribes the permittivity results to collective polarization effects arising from the particle clusters \nor large voids.  These secondary polarization fields would modify the primary polarization field \ncaused by the underlying random particle distribution. \nThe simulation results displayed no change with frequency from 0.01 to 1.00 GHz, and only \na 1% drop in effective permittivity values for 10.0 GHz.  The results also showed that EM fields \nwith wavelengths 2-5 orders of magnitude greater than the scale of the microstructural features \ncan detect subtle microstructural changes that do not alter the overall density, composition, or \nrandom disorder of the material.  The quasistatic limit has to therefore be carefully interpreted \nfor the simulated microstructures and conditions. \n \n31 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors thank Brent L.
