The effectiveness of such systems, however,\nremains controversial. There are suggestions that such multimedia applications may hold\nno advantage over traditional formats (Barron and Atkins, 1994; Ellis, 1994; Laurillard,\n1995; Simms, 1997; Leibowitz, 1999). One area where multimedia CBL may still prove its\nvalue is in the simulation of activities where experiential learning is expensive, undesirable\nor even dangerous.\nSimulation\nThe aviation industry has successfully been using computer-based simulation to train pilots\nfor a number of years, and the military use computer-generated simulations for battlefield\n5\nBernard M. Garrett and David Calkar Designing intelligent computer-based simulations: a pragmatic approach\ntactical training (Fletcher, 1999). Computer-based simulation has also proved valuable in\nareas where experiential learning may not be possible due to time, cost or operational\nconstraints such as in the training of police to respond to bomb threats (Chung and Huda,\n1999).\nThe use of computer-based simulations as learning tools has been developed in many areas\nof health-care education: intensive care (Henry and Waltmire, 1992), child health (Lauri,\n1992; Krawczak and Bersky, 1995), physical assessment (White, 1995), and midwifery\n(Woodsbn, 1997; Lyons, Miller and Milton, 1998). Clinical decision-making skills are\nanother area where the value of simulation has been recognized. During the training of\nnurses clinical decision-making skills are generally acquired in the practice setting under\nthe guidance of a qualified clinical mentor. The practice of structured reflection is used to\nevaluate student performance (Benner, 1984), but considerations of public safety make this\nmethod.of acquiring skills in clinical decision-making fraught with difficulties. There is\nusually some consolidation of practical decision-making experience with theory taught\nduring management studies in the final year of training. This is designed to help students\ndevelop their deductive reasoning skills. Paper-based simulation exercises are often used\nbut these are complex, unwieldy and difficult to manage for large groups of students. The\nuse of multimedia simulations for developing clinical decision-making skills in nursing\nstudents is undoubtedly an area where a computer-based tool would be useful. At least\nthree systems are currently in development for teaching clinical decision-making skills to\nnurses (Hjelm-Karlson and Stenbeck, 1997; Oliver, 1999; Garrett, 1997). These focus on\ndifferent specific areas where clinical decision-making is applied and demonstrate the value\nof computers in modelling deductive processes.\nThe last of these systems has been developed using an integrated intelligent agent in its\ndesign. This approach was taken in order to create a rich, effective multimedia learning\ntool, capable of developing deductive reasoning skills by giving individualized formative\nadvice to the students. It is suggested that students learn most effectively with simulation\nwhen there is feedback immediately following an event (Johannson and Wertenberger,\n1996; Lyons et al, 1998; Laurillard, 1995, 1997). In this way it is seen as relevant and\nbecomes integrated into the learning experience. It also gives positive reinforcement by the\nimmediate correction of misinterpretations. Lester, Stelling and Stone (1999) suggest that\nfeedback should be presented during problem-solving activity in such a manner that\ncontributes to learning effectiveness and efficiency. The intelligent agent in the system\ndescribed here was developed using the basic elements from intelligent tutoring system\ndesign but without the rigid framework imposed by this architecture.\nIntelligent Tutoring Systems\nOne of the beliefs behind the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in the late\n1970s was that computers can provide effective individualized formative assessment\n(Sleeman and Brown, 1982; Elsom-Cook, 1987; Wenger, 1990; Nwana, 1990, 1993).\nComputer systems were designed to emulate intelligent human behaviour, assessing\nstudent performance and giving guidance, as would a tutor with expert knowledge of the\nsubject. This type of system was a radical departure from Computer-Assisted Instruction\n(CAT). Prior to this, CAI used programmed units of learning in computer programs to\n6\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nproduce what were in effect programmed text-books, or branching programs which\nallowed a degree of student interaction, but gave no individualized feedback.\nThe ITS developed from research into knowledge-based systems where knowledge is\nrepresented by a defined knowledge set, and a program that operates upon this knowledge-\nbase (Bench-Capon, 1990). The use of heuristic search techniques by the program is also a\nkey clement of its design. This allows a student to see the reasoning undertaken to reach\nthe solution, but adds to the complexity of the system, as it must demonstrate the result\nand the proof. Knowledge-based systems and expert systems (which use a knowledge base\nand inference engine to represent the knowledge of an expert in a particular domain) are\none branch of 'artificial intelligence' research (Jackson, 1999).\nThe underlying paradigm on which they are based is that knowledge and every aspect of\nlearning can be precisely described in some way. Intelligent tutoring systems use an expert\nsystem for the representation of an expert's knowledge. Therefore an ITS has the distilled\nknowledge from the experience of people who have years of expertise in one particular\ndomain encoded in it. The encoding of this knowledge into expert systems has proceeded\non the basis that computer-based problem-solvers should be built to operate within a\nspecific domain, that of an expert's knowledge base (Jackson, 1999). In this way the\nbreadth of knowledge can be minimized and the depth of specific knowledge maximized\nand encoded. How to encode this knowledge and represent it within an application was\noriginally identified as one of the major problems in developing intelligent tutoring\nsystems (Sleeman and Brown* 1982) and it remains so today. Encoding expert knowledge\nrequires significant development time and is one of the more problematic features in\nmoving intelligent tutoring systems from the laboratory into the practical world (Seidel\nand Park, 1994).\nIn general an ITS has four main elements (Nwana, 1993):\n\u2022 an expert knowledge module (the domain knowledge);\n\u2022 a student model module (assessment of the individual student's abilities and\nperformance);\n\u2022 a tutoring module (structuring the learning appropriately within the system); and\n\u2022 a user interface module (between the system and the student or teacher).\nAn ITS differs from traditional CBL applications in several ways:\n\u2022 it can provide a clear articulation of knowledge in a limited domain;\n\u2022 it uses a model of student performance to drive instruction;\n\u2022 knowledge and inference rules are derived from the designer whilst the tutoring\nsequence and content is derived from student performance;\n\u2022 it provides diagnosis of errors rather than drill and practice; and\n\u2022 students can pose questions to an ITS.\nOne of the first examples of an expert system was MYCIN, which defined many of the\nstandard characteristics of expert system design (Clancy, 1983). It used backward chaining\nrules. These rules tested if certain conditions were satisfied and then led to an action.\n7\nBernard M. Garrett and David Callear Designing intelligent computer-based simulations: a pragmatic approach\nMYCIN attempted to match the action rather than the conditions during its operation and\nin this way it worked from goals to facts, eliminating the need to solve every possible\noutcome for a given set of rules. A depth-first (rather than breadth-first) strategy was also\nused to search the knowledge base. Clancy used MYCIN as a basis for developing an ITS\n(GUIDON) and went to great lengths to disentangle the pedagogic aspects of the ITS from\nthe expert system. Clancy used the ability to question the MYCIN system with 'how?' and\n'why?' questions as a basis for developing his ITS. In this way GUIDON could\ndemonstrate the way in which it made its decisions. The system stimulated the development\nof other intelligent tutoring systems and successfully addressed many of the problems in\nITS design. Intelligent tutoring systems developed today such as Anatom-Tutor, an\nintelligent anatomy tutoring system (Beaumont, 1994) and Atlas-Tutor, a cerebral\nradiography tutor (Garlatti, 1998), although more refined in their implementation, exhibit\nmany of the basic design elements of GUIDON.\nThe difficulties in creating these highly complex systems and proving their value, however,\ngoes some way to explain why they have yet to be widely adopted in mainstream education.\nThe prototype clinical decision simulator\nIn nurse education and training there is a need to develop effective decision-making skills\nin students based upon nursing knowledge, in much the same way that medical staff take\ndiagnostic decisions based on medical knowledge. An intelligent computer-based\nsimulation was needed to facilitate the development of those skills in a safe environment\nallowing the student to explore various 'what if?' decisions and obtain appropriate advice.\nThe underlying assumptions on which the system was designed were that:\n\u2022 successful clinical decision-making is based upon a hypothetico-deductive process\ninvolving inductive and deductive reasoning skills (Gordon, 1980; Putzier, Padrick,\nWestfall and Tanner, 1985; Padrick, Tanner, Putzier and Westfall, 1987; Ellis, 1997);\n\u2022 nurses pass through stages of development to achieve safe and competent practice.\nThese have been described by Benner (1984) as novice, advanced beginner, competent,\nproficient and expert.\nTo realize this, a system was developed taking some elements from ITS design but using a\nsimplified structure to facilitate the rapid development of an intelligent agent. This agent\nexamines the results of students' decision-making processes at each stage in their\nprogression through a computer-based simulation and provides appropriate individualized\nadvice.\nDesigning a modular system\nAn architecture for the system was chosen to provide an intuitive multimedia interface and\nto fulfil the basic requirements of an ITS whilst being relatively quick to produce. A design\nusing three modules was developed. This consists of a multimedia simulation interface, an\nexpert-assessment system and a searchable nursing knowledge base (see Figure 1).\nThe student accesses the system as a familiar Microsoft Windows application and uses a\nsimple multimedia interface (with a Web browser-style navigation bar) to move through the\napplication (see Figure 2). The design of this multimedia module was based upon the\n8\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nExpert Assessment Module (Prolog)\nFormative Assessment\nExpert Rule-Based System\nGeneration\nof\nTutorial\nAdvice\nSummatJve Assessment\nGeneration System\nGeneration\nof\nFinal Tutorial Advice\nSummary\nMultimedia Nursing Knowledge Module\nDstabsse\nSearch\nEngine\nKnowledge Base (Help File)\nMultimedia Problem Based Learning\nSimulation\n\"*\"(,' Student^)\nMultimedia Module (Delphi)\nFigure I: The three-module design.\nfunctional need to create a realistic simulation experience and to provide a stimulating\ninterface that promoted interaction. Digitized video is used extensively to play out the\nscenarios for the student. Adding interactive video increases the realism of the simulations\nand provides a challenge to the student to solve the problems. The videos were filmed using\na local group of actors in a hospital setting to add realism. The video was filmed with a\ndigital video camera and edited into AVI Image format to retain quality, although this has\nthe disadvantage of producing a rather large file size. This did not present a problem, as the\nfinal medium for the application was CD-ROM, giving sufficient storage volume. Audio\nwas also used extensively with music and sound clips to accompany various elements of the\nprogram. The audio was used to give audible cues to certain system events, such as\nreceiving advice or entering a chosen simulation.\nThe student is introduced to the Clinical Decision Simulator (CDS) through the multi-\nmedia module and selects the appropriate simulation from this interface. An example of a\npathway in the simulation is outlined in Figure 1.\nThis module shows the digitized video sequences, controls all of the branching of the\nsimulation pathways and presents questions to the student following events in the\nsimulation. Simulation branching is dependent upon the decisions made by the student in\nanswering these questions. This module also controls the sequencing of tutorial\ninformation, sending and retrieving data from the expert assessment module as required.\nThe student can also access the help module directly via the multimedia interface and\n9\nBernard M. Garrett and David Collear Designing intelligent computer-based simulations: a pragmatic approach\nThe student is placed in the role of a nurse taking charge of a group of junior staff for a morning shift on a\nmedical ward.\n1. The student is asked to allocate patients to appropriate nursing staff.\n2. The student makes a selection and allocates the patients unfairly.\n3. Another senior nurse complains that the allocation is unfair:\n4. Advice is given stating which nurse had the unfair allocation and why this was not good practice. It\nalso suggests the nurse examine the section on managing workload in the help file, which becomes\naccessible at this point The solution is not given, however\n5. The student is given another opportunity to allocate patients to appropriate nursing staff.\n6. The student makes a selection and allocates the patients fairly and safely.\n7. The nurses go out on to the ward to see their patients\n8. Workmen arrive unexpectedly asking if they can have access to carry out repairs to the ward floor\n9. The student fails to make a decision in the allocated time for the question and is prompted to make\na decision.\n10. The student allows the workmen in.\n11. A patient falls over the workmen's tools and complains.\n12. The student is asked to decide which nurses are sent on a coffee break first\n13. The student sends too many staff off the ward at once.\n14. A patient develops symptoms of haemorrhage.\n15. The student fails to alert the doctor\n16. A doctor arrives to undertake a procedure and is annoyed no nurses are available.\n17. The doctor is annoyed no one had informed him of the patient with the symptoms of haemorrhage.\n18. Advice is given suggesting the student has made several unsafe decisions in not noticing the\nseriousness of the haemorrhage symptoms, sending too many staff off the ward at one time and\nallowing workmen access inappropriately. The advice explains why this is unsafe practice. It also\nsuggests the nurse examine the sections on signs and symptoms of haemorrhage, safe skill mix of\nstaff and multi-professional team work in the help file (which becomes accessible at this point).The\nsolutions to the questions are not directly given in the help file, but the students can determine the\nreason they have made clinical errors.The advice also notes that the student took too long to make\na decision in this situation (and also notes if this has occurred in other questions they have\nanswered).\nThe simulation continues until the shift has been completed and after the final question summative advice\nis offered to the student This lists all of the formative advice generated during the simulation and also\ngives advice categorizing the student's performance in each situation as unsafe (novice level), poor\npractice (beginners' level) or competent (competency expected for a qualified nurse). The student may\nprint off this advice.\nThe student has scored several unsafe and poor practice remarks so the advice suggests they examine the\nspecific sections of the help file involved. It also suggests that they discuss the advice generated with their\ntutor or mentor and then run the simulation again (if they had scored consistently competent practice\nthey would have been congratulated and offered an alternative simulation to try).\nFigure 2: Example of a simulation pathway.\n10\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nsearch for information about clinical decision-making or particular aspects of the\nsimulations. Once the student has engaged in a simulation, however, access to the help file\nis not available and the module commences timing the student's responses to questions\nposed. Help becomes available at each point the simulation is interrupted for the student to\nreceive advice. Information about the student's answers and the time taken to respond is\nrecorded by the multimedia module and is then passed to the expert assessment module\nwhich builds up a model of the student's performance as they progress.\nAn anthropomorphic representation of a human tutor is used to deliver advice from the\nexpert assessment module to the student. A simple animated talking figure with accom-\npanying text was produced to achieve this representation (see Figure 3). The expert\nassessment module generates the actual feedback given by this figure. The agent was\ndesigned to take the role of a mentor and is represented as such. This style of pedagogic\nagent was chosen to facilitate the learning process. The expert assessment module can be\nseen as analogous to a human tutor in this context. The anthropomorphic representation is\nuseful to contextualize the feedback from the system and enhance student interaction with\nthe system (Heitala and Niemirepo, 1998; Lester et ah, 1999).\nThe expert assessment module was developed to give appropriate tutorial advice for all the\npossible outcomes from decision-making pathways. Advice is generated in this module by a\nbackward chaining expert system. This module uses rules concerning the outcomes of\ndecisions, ways in which decisions are made during the simulation, and their relationship\nwith defined competent nursing practice in this context.\nThe student cannot directly access the expert assessment module but does so via the\nmultimedia module.\nThe advice itself clearly identifies why it was generated and makes reference to appropriate\nsections in a nursing knowledge base which the student can access and examine for further\ndetailed information on the particular issue involved. In this way, a heuristic tutorial\nstrategy is realized.\nThe advice is also designed to promote a hypothetico-deductive approach to solving the\nproblems in the simulation, rather than giving the student the complete answer. Rather\nthan attempt to codify the complete domain knowledge for the subject area and then\nmodel the student's performance on predetermined performance templates (as in a\ntraditional ITS design), an alternative strategy was used. The expert knowledge base was\nlimited to the domain knowledge essential for successful navigation through the\nsimulations.\nThe associated relevant clinical knowledge was simply represented in the third module\nusing text and graphical material. This third module contains a clinical nursing knowledge\nbase and was developed in the form of a Microsoft Windows help file. It also contains\ninformation on using the program and links to a Web site with further resources and\nupdates. Reference to appropriate parts of this module is made by the advice from the\nintelligent agent, or it can be directly accessed and searched by the student (see Figure 3).\nI I\nBernard M.

The initial stage of\ndevelopment consisted of identifying vignettes to use in the simulations. This was\neventually narrowed down to two scenarios, one based upon managing a patient with a\nspecific clinical condition (bronchial carcinoma), and the other upon the management of.\nthe clinical environment. These were chosen to illustrate the potential for different types of\nsimulation to be used. Two decision-tree pathways were developed, one for each of these\nscenarios. These were then discussed with professional nurse educators and expert\nclinicians to ensure that they represented realistic professional situations, and modifica-\ntions were made where necessary. Flow diagrams were then created to represent these\nscenarios and all the decision pathways mapped out. Simulation pathways are relatively\nquick to code from branching flow diagrams, and appropriate points for student feedback\nwere integrated into these pathways.\nMultiple-choice questions were used following events rather than open free-text questions\nas although this limits the realism of the simulation, it allows simulations to be developed\nand coded rapidly, and provides a simple way to assess student performance. Following the\ndevelopment of the simulation module an expert assessment module was coded using an\nadvice knowledge base, rules and an inference engine based upon all the possible decision-\nmaking outcomes for the scenarios.\n12\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nThe multimedia interface module and simulation pathways were coded using an object-\noriented language (Borland Delphi). This was chosen for ease of construction using\nevent-driven programming. It provided a rapid application development environment to\ntest the system as it was coded and gave the flexibility to link with an expert system created\nwith another language (LPA WinProlog). Developing an intelligent agent with an object-\noriented language, whilst feasible, would be cumbersome and time-consuming, so it was\ndeveloped using Prolog. This language is based upon the principles of logic, and use of\nrules is inherent in its structure; it is therefore well suited for the task of expert system\nconstruction. LPA WinProlog was chosen as this implementation of the language provides\nan interface to link the expert system as a dynamic library with an object-coded Microsoft\nWindows application.\nFinally the nursing knowledge-base module was written for each of the simulations and\ncoded using a Microsoft Windows help-file creation tool (HelpScribble).\nDiscussion\nIntelligent tutoring systems, whilst promising, remain time-consuming and complex to\ndevelop. At present there has been little uptake of these systems in mainstream educational\npractice and they tend to be restricted to experimental work. Justifying the development\ninvestment required for such systems is also difficult (Seidel and Park, 1994). There is little\ndoubt that they offer great potential to harness the power of computers to provide\nintelligent individualized assessment, but unless techniques for domain knowledge\nrepresentation become more accessible to the majority of teachers then it is difficult to see\nthis situation changing.\nUsing the approach outlined in this paper, it is possible to construct and code a relatively\nsimple model of student behaviour within the limited domain of the simulation. The\nadvantages of this design are that it retains many of the important elements of an ITS\nwithout the time required for a full ITS development. The main disadvantage is that the\nagent does not model the complete domain knowledge for the student. However, it can\nguide the student to find this knowledge. The design has been developed to provide\npersonalized formative and summative advice to the student with an intelligent agent,\nwhilst allowing reasonably rapid application development.\nThe clinical simulations offer greater realism than paper-based exercises and the system has\nthe advantage over a traditional multimedia system in that it offers the student\nindividualized advice, and promotes heuristic learning rather than didactic instruction. A\ncomparative evaluation of the system against a similar system without the intelligent agent\nis currently being undertaken to establish the value of this approach.\nThe modular design presents a more accessible method to create intelligent simulations by\nlimiting specific domain knowledge to a help system knowledge base and by separating the\ntutorial advice and rules into a separate expert assessment module. The system itself is\nadaptable and easily extended. Further simulations can be developed and added into the\nsystem and the expert assessment system can easily have advice added to its database, its\nrules modified or additional rules created. This is offered as a pragmatic approach to\ncreating intelligent simulations, whilst offering many of the advantages of an intelligent\ntutoring system. There are now third-party expert-system components available for several\n13\nBernard M. Gorrett and David Callear Designing intelligent computer-based simulations: a pragmatic approach\nobject-oriented languages, making the development of this type of intelligent system even\nmore straightforward.\nThe potential for future development for this approach is to provide a simulation\ndevelopment environment whereby less technically skilled users can model and build their\nown simulations in much the same way as existing multimedia design applications are used.\nReferences\nBarron, A.
