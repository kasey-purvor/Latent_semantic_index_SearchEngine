However, multiple linear \nregression models showed that few indicators of women\u2019s empowerment were \nsignificantly associated with mortality due to injury and poisoning for both women \nand men. When three Baltic states with considerably higher mortality rates (Latvia, \nLithuania and Estonia) were excluded from the analysis, however, only one indicator \n(female economic activitiy as a percentage of male economic activity) remained a \nsignificant predictor of men\u2019s death rates.  \nConclusion \nThese data suggest that some indicators of women\u2019s empowerment may be associated \nwith mortality due to injury and poisoning for men, although the association was \ndependent on which countries were included in the analysis. This highlights the \nimportance of examining in greater detail the influence of changing gender roles on \nthe health behaviours of women and men. \nKeywords Gender; empowerment; inequality; public health \n \nGender empowerment 3\nSex differences in mortality rates are found on a global scale. Numerous \nstudies have shown that men can expect shorter life expectancies than women, \nparticularly in socio-economically developed nations [1-4]. In Western Europe, for \ninstance, this sex difference is stable across the life course [5-6] and is most \nprominent for violent causes of death [1, 7-8]. Traditionally, this sex difference in \nmortality was explained as a function of biological differences between women and \nmen [9]. More recent work, however, has shifted the focus onto gender differences in \nhealth-related or risk behaviors, such as alcohol and cigarette consumption [10-11], \nhigh risk sports [12], dangerous driving and denial of vulnerability [13-15]. In most \nsettings, men\u2019s greater risk behaviours are thought to contribute to their higher rates \nof mortality compared with women [12-16]. \nIn addition, there is evidence that the structure of gender relations, or gender \norder, is an important determinant of sex differences in health [13, 17] and that some \ncountries may be less structured by gender than others [18-19]. Thus, research on \ngender inequality, whether measured by political participation, economic autonomy or \nreproductive rights [20-22], suggests that women\u2019s relative lack of power adversely \naffects their well-being [23]. Moreover, gender inequality is detrimental to the \ndominant or hegemonic male group. Recent studies have shown that patriarchy \u2013 the \n\u2018systematic domination of women by men and domination of men by other men\u2019 [24] \n\u2013 is detrimental for men\u2019s health and leads to their higher mortality [5, 15, 22, 25-26]. \nGiven the lower status accorded to women by comparison with men in most \nsocieties, it seems intuitive that as societies become more gender equal, there will be a \ncorresponding improvement in women\u2019s and men\u2019s health. From this perspective, a \nconsistent public policy aimed at reducing inequalities between men and women is a \n \nGender empowerment 4\nkey element in improving public health. However, when studies have examined this \npossibility, they have tended to report conflicting results.  \nOn the one hand are studies that report beneficial effects of gender equality on \nthe health of women [27-29] and men [13, 30]. For women, socioeconomic changes \nthat integrate women into the public sphere \u2013 the worlds of labour, politics and social \nlife \u2013 offer beneficial health effects accrued as a result of greater economic \nindependence, better familial negotiating power, increased opportunity for social \ninteraction, skill enhancement and personal growth [29, 31]. For men, on the other \nhand, improved gender equality may lead to a reduction in risky behaviours, as they \nno longer need to demonstrate their \u2018masculine\u2019 identities through cultural signifiers \n[14].  \nBy contrast, a number of studies have suggested that, although gender equality \nis an important and valuable goal in itself, the association between women\u2019s \nempowerment and improved health may not be so straightforward. Given that \nbehavioural factors play a large role in explaining men\u2019s disadvantage for many \nhealth outcomes [26, 30-31], it is possible that some men may feel threatened by \nfemale competition and their relative loss of power. In such a scenario, some men \nmay engage in compensatory masculinities that endanger the self and others [29, 32]. \nMoreover, given that men are overwhelmingly the main perpetrators of violence \nagainst women [32], male violence may also result in increased female death rates \nfrom violence.  \nAdditionally, as some women move into the public sphere, it is possible that \nthey may engage in risky masculine behaviour as a means of integration and \nattenuating threats to their identity [34], or as a result of increased life opportunities \n[35-36] or narrowing gender differences in patriarchal family patterns [37].  Thus, any \n \nGender empowerment 5\nchange towards gender equality may be detrimental for women\u2019s and men\u2019s health, \nunless it is accompanied by significant alterations in the way women and men relate \nto their changing roles. More generally, until such a time when societal institutions \nadapt to pressures for change, health benefits expected as a result of improvements in \ngender equality may be held in check [38]. \n In the present study, we examined the association between indicators of \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and mortality due to injury and poisoning (accidents, \nhomicide, suicide and deaths due to undetermined causes) in Europe. Empowerment \nis a complex and evolving term, but its most common current usage is as a reference \nto the extent of women\u2019s involvement in three related societal domains (see Box 1): \npolitical participation and decision-making, economic participation and decision-\nmaking power, and power over economic resources [39]. It is, therefore, possible to \nexamine country-level associations between measures of women\u2019s empowerment, and \nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s health-related behaviours.  \n------------------------ \nInsert Box 1 about here \n------------------------ \nWe further operationalised health-related behaviours using rates of death by \ninjury and poisoning (violent death), which provides a useful indicator of risk-taking \nand self-destructive behaviour leading to higher mortality. Moreover, violent death \ncan also be considered as an indicator of male behaviour on the basis that men are the \nmain perpetrators of violence, particularly domestic and sexual violence [33]. In short, \nthen, we sought to examine the association of a number of indicators of women\u2019s \nempowerment with violent death among women and men in 27 European countries.  \nMETHODS \n \nGender empowerment 6\n Data on age standardised male and female rates of death by injury and \npoisoning per 100,000 were obtained for 24 European Union countries, plus Norway, \nIceland and Switzerland. The ICD codes used for injury and poisoning were V01-\nY98, taken from Chapter 20 of ICD-10. The ages of injury covered all ages and were \ndirectly standardised using the European population as the standard population. \nMortality rates were taken from the World Health Organisation European Health for \nAll [40] database for the most recent available year (see Table 1). Nine indicators of \nwomen\u2019s empowerment were available for all the 24 countries and were, therefore, \nused in the present study. These were: (i) female unemployment in the female labour \nforce as a ratio of male unemployment in the male labour force [41]; (ii) ratio of male \nto female earned income [42]; (iii) female economic activity rate as a percentage of \nmale economic activity rate [42]; (iv) maternity leave benefits (percentage of wages \npaid in the first six weeks) [43]; (v) weeks of maternity leave [42]; (vi) female \nlegislators, senior officials and managers as a percentage of the total [42]; (vii) the \nfemale to male ratio for average years of schooling [41]; (viii) women in government \nat a ministerial level, as a percentage of the total, and [42]; (ix) seats in parliament \n(single or lower house) held by women as a percentage of the total [42]. Data used for \nall indicators was for the latest available year (see Table 1). Gross domestic product \n(GDP) was obtained from the 2003 Human Development Report [39].  \nTo investigate the relationship between age-standardised mortality rates and \nindicators of female empowerment, multiple linear regression models were used. \nIndicators of empowerment that were found to be correlated with death rates using \ncorrelation analysis were selected as independent variables to be included in separate \nregression models. Indicators of empowerment were not included in the same \nregression model due to the correlation between the variables and to investigate each \n \nGender empowerment 7\nempowerment indicator separately, given potential differential effects on health \nbehaviours. GDP was included in each model to adjust for any differences in \nsocioeconomic circumstances between the countries. Age-standardised death rate was \nassessed for normality using the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic prior to conducting the \nregression analyses.  \n------------------------ \nInsert Table 1 about here \n------------------------ \nRESULTS \n The distribution of data for male and female rates of death by injury and \npoisoning did not differ significantly from normality (Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic \nfor normality, age standardised female rate of violent death, p=.269; age standardised \nmale rate of violent death, p=.111). Each variable was, therefore, correlated \nunivariately using parametric methods with indicators of women\u2019s empowerment, and \nthe results are presented in Table 2. However, it was also noticeable that three Baltic \nstates (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) had mortality rates that were considerably \nhigher than the other European countries. We, therefore, conducted a sensitivity \nanalysis of the data by running separate regression models excluding these Baltic \nstates, to assess the influence on estimates of effect (see below). \n------------------------ \nInsert Table 2 about here \n------------------------ \nMale mortality from injury and poisoning  \nAge standardised death rates from injury and poisoning for men were found to \nbe strongly correlated with two indicators of female empowerment; female legislators, \n \nGender empowerment 8\nsenior officials and managers as a percentage of the total (r=0.664, p=0.001) and \nfemale economic activity as a percentage of male economic activity (r=0.375, \np=0.054). GDP was also found to be significantly correlated with death rates (r=-565, \np=0.002). Two regression models were, therefore, created  out to quantify the effect \nof each indicator of female empowerment on age standardised death rates from injury \nand poisoning in men, adjusting for GDP (Table 3).  \n------------------------ \nInsert Table 3 about here \n------------------------ \nThe first regression model (including all countries) identified a significant \nrelationship between the proportion of female legislators, senior officials and \nmanagers as a percentage of the total and age standardised mortality rates for injury \nand poisoning in men, after adjusting for GDP (\u03b2=5.954, t=3.439, p=.002. However, \nafter excluding the Baltic States, this relationship achieved borderline significance (\u03b2= \n2.079, t=-2.055, p=.054).  \nThe second regression model (including all countries) found female economic \nactivity to only have borderline significance in relation to age standardised mortality \nrates for injury and poisoning in men (\u03b2=1.487, t=2.020, p=.055). After excluding the \nBaltic States, this relationship was found to be statistically significant (\u03b2=0.821, t=-\n2.547, p=.019).  \nFemale mortality from injury and poisoning \n Age standardised rates of death from injury and poisoning for women were \nfound to be correlated with (i) the ratio of female to male unemployment (r=-0.382, \np=0.049); (ii) the ratio of male to female earned income (r=0.340, p=0.082); (iii) \nfemale economic activity as a percentage of male economic activity (r=0.393, \n \nGender empowerment 9\np=0.043), and ;(iv) female legislators, senior officials and managers as a percentage of \nthe total (r=0.542, p=0.005). These four indicators of female empowerment were \nincorporated in separate regression models adjusting for GDP (Table 4).  \n----------------------- \nInsert Table 4 about here \n----------------------- \n Only two of the four indicators of female empowerment (including all \ncountries) were found to be significantly associated with age standardised death rates \nby injury and poisoning in women: (i) the proportion of female legislators, senior \nofficials and managers (\u03b2=0.995, t=2.358, p=.028), and; (ii) female unemployment as \na ratio of male unemployment (\u03b2=-10.843, t=2.228, p=.035). After exclusion of the \nthree Baltic States none of the indicators of female empowerment were found to \nsignificantly predict age standardised death rates by injury and poisoning in women.  \nDISCUSSION \n The results of this study showed a significant association between some \nindicators of women\u2019s empowerment and violent death in 27 European countries. \nSpecifically, for all 27 countries, two indicators of women\u2019s empowerment (female \nlegislators, senior officials and managers as a percentage of the total, and; female \neconomic activity as a percentage of male economic activity) were significantly \nassociated (or had borderline significance) with male mortality from injury and \npoisoning. Of these indicators, female legislators, senior officials and managers was \nthe stronger predictor. When three Baltic states were excluded from the analysis, \nfemale economic activity remained strongly associated with male mortality. Thus, \neven after excluding the Baltic outliers, female economic activity was significantly \nassociated with male injury and poisoning mortality. \n \nGender empowerment 10\nIt would appear, therefore, that as the proportion of women who are \neconomically active compared to men increases, this has a detrimental effect on the \nhealth-related behaviours of men, particularly risk behaviours. These results are \nconsistent with the proposal that some men respond to improved gender equality by \nengaging in risky or self-destructive behaviours [14, 32, 34]. It may be that, as women \nincreasingly occupy traditionally masculine roles, thus challenging stereotypes of \nhegemonic masculinities, some men engage in compensatory risky behaviours [13]. \nThis may include such behaviours as drink driving and violence towards others, which \nendanger not only men as a whole but also women [14, 30, 32]. Furthermore, it is \nlikely that it is the most disadvantaged, powerless men who experience the greatest \nincrease in violent death as women begin to gain some power. Such men may be \nreluctant to change their behaviour, and engage in risky behaviour as a means of \nasserting what appears to be a diminishing masculine identity.  \nFor women, on the other hand, when all 27 countries were included in the \nanalysis, four indicators of empowerment (the ratio of female to male unemployment; \nthe ratio of male to female earned income; female economic activity as a percentage \nof male economic activity, and; female legislators, senior officials and managers as a \npercentage of the total) had a significant (or borderline significant) association with \nviolent death among women. The strongest association was with the proportion of \nwomen in high-ranking positions. However, when the three Baltic outliers were \nremoved from the analysis, none of these relationships remained significant. This \nsuggests that, in Europe, women\u2019s empowerment may not be associated with violent \ndeath.  \n In general, these findings do not support the suggestion that women\u2019s \nempowerment results in greater risk-taking or self-destructive behaviour among \n \nGender empowerment 11\nwomen. That is, the opportunities accrued as a result of improved gender equality do \nnot appear to adversely affect women in terms of their health-related behaviour. This \nis in contrast to previous single-nation [34, 36, 44-45] and cross-national studies [35], \nwhich have suggested that improved gender equality is associated with more \nmasculine behaviour among women, which in turn is associated with poorer life \noutcomes (although it is difficult to generalise findings from earlier studies, as they \nmay be dependent on cultural factors unique to a specific period of time or locality).  \n However, the present results also suggest that cultural factors may underscore \ncross-national differences in mortality rates due to injury and poisoning, particularly \nin relation to the difference between Baltic states and the rest of Europe for women\u2019s \nviolent death. That is, specific factors associated with violent death (e.g., rates of \nalcohol consumption) may differ between countries, which in turn influences the risk \nof injury  and poisoning deaths. Furthermore, the nature of women\u2019s empowerment \nand what it means for women \u2018on the ground\u2019 will vary by country and will need to be \nunderstood within the wider historical, cultural and welfare contexts specific to each \ncountry. In the present study, such cultural differences were not controlled for in view \nof the proposed mediating role of risk behaviours between empowerment and health. \nNevertheless, it would be useful for future research to measure independent \nassociations between different types of risk behaviour and women\u2019s empowerment.  \nThese results have implications for strategies aimed at reducing sex \ndifferences in mortality, which we believe is associated with gender equality. \nSpecifically, the effects of women\u2019s empowerment on women\u2019s and men\u2019s health \nbehaviours are unlikely to be straightforward or immediate. Rather, changes in the \nsocioeconomic and political roles of women may adversely affect men\u2019s health \nbehaviours, unless there is a corresponding change in the behaviour of men as they \n \nGender empowerment 12\nadapt to their changing roles [34, 46]. The available evidence suggests that, when men \ndo alter their behaviour, it has a beneficial effect on their health [13]. In short, the \nbeneficial effects of improved gender equality will likely only accrue when men no \nlonger feel a need to demonstrate their masculinity through cultural signifiers and \nwhen a more supportive environment emerges for the new roles of women in public \nspheres.  \nIn the present study, we attempted to identify all aspects of empowerment that \nwere available as routine data across countries. Other factors could have been \nincluded such as women\u2019s participation in local government, measures of \noccupational composition, and the division of labour in public and private spheres \n[47]. Nevertheless, the selection of multiple factors used in this study was consistent \nwith the definition of gender empowerment set out by the United Nations Human \nDevelopment Report [39] and covered the main dimensions of political participation, \neconomic decision-making power, and power over economic resources. In this way, \nwe increased the probability that these factors meaningfully captured dimensions of \ngender empowerment.  \n A more serious limitation concerns the cross-section ecological nature of the \nstudy, and the fact that we were not able to control for potential confounding variables \nsuch as income inequality, the proportion living in poverty and so on. Nevertheless, it \nis important to note that our results are, in outline, consistent with studies conducted \nwith individual-level data [34]. A further related difficulty concerns the \ngeneralisability of these findings. With population-level data it is not possible to make \npredictions at the level of the individual. In this sense, the definition of gender \nempowerment that we have relied upon may not be adequate, as it does not take into \naccount other diverse forms of oppression, such as class or race. Multi-dimensional \n \nGender empowerment 13\ndata and analyses would provide a better understanding of whether gender \nempowerment is associated with negative health effects at both individual and \nnational levels. In particular, it may be useful to examine the association between \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and sex differences in health across time, using time-series \nanalyses for example. \n These limitations notwithstanding, the findings of the present study suggest \nthat some indicators of women\u2019s empowerment are significantly associated with \nmortality from violence for men in 27 European countries. At a practical level, this \nstudy raises important questions about the partial nature of any move towards gender \nequality that does not also involve a change in individual, societal and institutional \nattitudes toward traditional gender roles. Alongside efforts at improving gender \nequality, which is a worthwhile end in itself, public policies are needed that challenge \nattitudes towards traditional gender roles, which, if left unchecked, adversely affect \nthe health of men.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe are grateful for the helpful comments of two anonymous reviewers on an earlier \nversion of this manuscript. \n \n \nGender empowerment 14\nREFERENCES \n1.

It is most usually \nassociated with two different literatures: the feminist literature and the international \ndevelopment literature.  \nThe contemporary conceptualisation of empowerment derives from the radical \npolitical movements of the 1960s, including the women\u2019s movement [48]. Women\u2019s \nempowerment has been used to \u2018describe a struggle for social justice and women\u2019s \nequality that involves transforming economic, social and political structures\u2019 [49]. In \nthis definition, it is stressed that women\u2019s empowerment \u2018should lead to the liberation \nof men from false value systems and ideologies of oppression. It should lead to a \nsituation where each one can become a whole being regardless of gender, and use their \nfullest potential to construct a more humane society for all\u2019 [49]. \nIn the international development literature, women\u2019s empowerment is used in \nmany different contexts (e.g., as an indicator of level of development) and by many \ndifferent organisations including the World Bank, United Nations, the UK Department \nfor International Development, Oxfam and various other international development \nagencies [50]. Here, women\u2019s empowerment is variously associated with challenging \noppression and inequality (Oxfam) or increasing women\u2019s participation, autonomy \nand decision making (UN).   \nEmpowerment is about opening up access to decision making, and also about \nthe ability to make choices, and be involved in shaping what choices are on offer.  \nEssentially then, empowerment corresponds to women challenging existing power \nstructures which subordinate women [50]. \nTable 1.
