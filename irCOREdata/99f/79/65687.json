By \u201cregulatory environment\u201d is meant the requirements that \nare either placed upon providers of Higher Education (in the U.K. through the Quality Assurance \nAgency for Higher Education \u2013 QAA1), or which such providers choose to adopt, usually for the \npurposes of a quality \u2018badge\u2019 (such as AMBA2, EQUIS3 or AACSB4 accreditation). \n \nThe purpose of this paper, then, is firstly to classify and secondly to compare and contrast the \nvarious requirements that these regulatory bodies make in relation to the teaching of business ethics. \nFrom this analysis the implications for Business Schools or equivalent departments (hereafter \n\u201cBusiness Schools\u201d) are developed and discussed. The focus of the paper is on the U.K. and the \nimplications for U.K. Business Schools, but by drawing on the EQUIS and AACSB accreditation \nstandards (which in themselves have relevance to the U.K.), a broader international perspective is \nalso offered. \n \n \nClassifying the regulatory environment \n \nWithin the U.K. the curriculum for all courses \/ programmes is increasingly being affected by a \nrequirement to conform to a \u201cSubject Benchmark Statement\u201d (SBS). Such statements \u201cprovide a \nmeans for the academic community to describe the nature and characteristics of programmes in a \nspecific subject\u201d (QAA, 2000, for example). Although these statements \u201care not a specification of a \ndetailed curriculum in the subject\u201d, they do, \u201cprovide general guidance for articulating the learning \noutcomes associated with the programme\u201d (ibid.) Such statements can be characterised as \nmandatory - providing a regulatory environment within which programmes of study in any \nparticular subject should operate. \n \nWithin Business and Management, there are currently three such statements which apply to General \nBusiness and Management programmes, Accounting programmes (both at undergraduate level) and \nMasters awards in Business and Management. Within these documents there are statements on \ncurriculum and skills, each containing a requirement relating in some way to business ethics. These \nmight be characterised as prescriptive statements in that the phrases that govern the coverage of \nparticular topics are typically prescriptive in nature \u2013 \u201cshould provide\u201d, \u201cshould have\u201d, \u201cwill \ntherefore be able\u201d. \n \nAn alternative, voluntary approach, is offered by accrediting agencies. Within the U.K., AMBA \noffers guidelines for MBA programmes. These guidelines are voluntary since the seeking of AMBA \naccreditation is at the discretion of the provider. Similarly, accreditation by agencies outside the \nU.K. \u2013 EQUIS in Europe and AACSB in the U.S.A. - is also voluntary5. \n 2\n \nThese agencies take a more broad-brush approach, focussing on staffing, research and student \ncomposition in ways that are beyond the subject-specific interests of the QAA. However, within the \nguidelines offered by these agencies there are similarly statements about curriculum and skills but \nwhile some of these are prescriptive, in the manner described above, some are permissive \u2013 \nindicating, for example, that business ethics might be included in the curriculum, but not \nprescribing that it should be. \n \nThis classification of the regulatory environment into mandatory versus voluntary and prescriptive \nversus permissive leads to a 2 x 2 matrix, with four different types, as shown in Figure 1 below6. \n \n \nFigure 1: Classification of the regulatory environment in the UK \n \n Mandatory Voluntary \n \nPrescriptive \n \nQAA \n \nAMBA \n \n \nPermissive \n  \nEQUIS \nAACSB \n \n \nThis classification shows QAA SBSs as imposing, in effect, a requirement to incorporate business \nethics into the curriculum of General Business and Management and Accounting programmes at \nundergraduate level and all Masters degrees in Business and Management. The nature of that \nrequirement is explored further below. \n \nThe AMBA guidelines, also explored below, are voluntary but prescriptive in nature. Of course, for \nthose Business Schools which choose to seek, or already have, AMBA accreditation, the \nrequirement becomes mandatory. \n \nEQUIS and AACSB accreditation is also voluntary but would similarly become mandatory for \nthose Business Schools which seek, or already have, it. However, in this case EQUIS\u2019 and \nAACSB\u2019s requirements can be classified as permissive. Again, this is explored further below. \nBefore doing so, however, it is worth pausing at this point to consider the recent debate engendered \nby this issue within the AACSB membership. \n \n \nThe AACSB debate \n \nAACSB was founded in 1916 and began its accreditation function in 1919. In the period to the \npresent day, several additions and revisions to its standards have taken place, the most recent of \nwhich were approved in April 2003. In the debate that preceded this approval, the business ethics \ncommunity voiced strong concerns about the lack of a mandatory course (\u201cmodule\u201d in U.K. \nparlance). This concern was expressed in an open letter to AACSB by Professor Duane Windsor7 \ndated 8 October 2002 and this letter was strongly endorsed by the U.S.-based Society for Business \n 3\nEthics (SBE, 2003) which encouraged members to write to AACSB in support of this position. \nProfessor Windsor\u2019s demand was that, \n \n\u201crather than emphasizing \u2026 that no particular courses are indicated, I would go further to \nstate that the one course AACSB expects to be required universally and essentially is \ncoverage of environments of business, ethical and responsible behavior, and diversity \u2026 I \nfavor an explicit statement that thou shalt have a business and society course in some form, \nthou shalt work that perspective in addition throughout the curriculum, and thou shalt be \nprepared to demonstrate to an accreditation committee that such standards have been met\u201d. \n \nVarious sides were taken in the debate, from those, like SBE, which were in support, to those who \nopposed on the grounds that such a requirement would endanger academic freedom and that general \nstandards (\u201clearning experiences\u201d in AACSB terminology), rather than particular courses were the \nappropriate way forward. A further perspective was that either way this amounted to public \neducation institutions abdicating their responsibility for curriculum and so should be opposed as a \nmatter of principle (see Business Ethics, 2003, p.20). \n \nDespite the pressure placed upon it, AACSB maintained its view that its \u201cstandard requires use of a \nsystematic process for curriculum management but does not require any specific courses in the \ncurriculum\u201d (AACSB, 2003, p.18). This confirmed a move away from requiring some kind of \ncourse in business and society that was implicit in the 1970 standards but moderated by the \nmission-driven standards adopted in the 1990s. The actual requirements of AACSB currently are \ndetailed below, but the fall-out from this gradual move away from a course requirement has led to \nconsiderable concern that business ethics is in the process of disappearing from curricula in the \nU.S., with evidence of courses being down-graded in size or eliminated altogether (Kelly, 2003). \nNor is the issue dead, with a continuing campaign being waged to have stronger ethics education \n(SBE, 2004). \n \nNonetheless, the AACSB approach is common to other accrediting agencies considered here, none \nof which require a course (module) or specify how learning outcomes should be incorporated into \nthe curriculum. In all cases, this is left to curriculum designers to decide how best to incorporate \nany requirements to include business ethics. \n \n \nThe requirements of the regulatory bodies \n \nEach of the six documents referred to above8 that specify learning outcomes in relation to the \nbusiness and management curriculum was analysed. The analysis was based on noting any parts of \nthe text that used any of the following terms: purpose; ethics; values; norms; social issues (where it \nwas at least conceivable that this might include ethical issues rather than a general reference to \nsocio-cultural factors); environment and sustainability (where it was at least reasonably clear, in \ncontext, that this referred to the natural rather than the business environment and to sustainability in \nterms of sustainable development rather than business survival); governance; responsibility; \naccountability.  \n \nThese documents generally specify learning outcomes, or the equivalent, in terms of both \nknowledge and skills. This, of course, conforms to a conventional distinction within education of \n 4\n\u201ccognition\u201d (knowledge, perception and thought) and \u201caffect\u201d (attitudes, emotions, motivation, \nvalues and interpersonal skills) (see, for example, Bligh et al., 1999, p.79). Consequently, it was \nnoted whether any statement was intended to produce a cognitive and \/ or affective learning \noutcome. The analysis is shown in Table 1 below, where the relevant section of each statement is \ngiven verbatim and the key words are highlighted for ease of reference.  \n \nTable 1: Analysis of regulatory statements \n \n \nStatement: QAA SBS General Business and Management (undergraduate) \nType: Mandatory \/ prescriptive \n \nCognitive learning outcomes Affective learning outcomes \nGraduates will be able to demonstrate relevant \nknowledge and understanding of organisations \n[and] the external environment \u2026 \n\u201cOrganisations\u201d \u2013 this encompasses the internal \naspects, functions and processes of organisations \nincluding their \u2026 purposes [and] governance. \n\u201cExternal environment\u201d \u2013 this encompasses a \nwide range of factors, including \u2026 \nenvironmental, ethical \u2026 \nWithin [this] framework, it is expected that \ngraduates will be able to demonstrate knowledge \nand understanding in \u2026 contemporary & \npervasive  issues [of which] the following are \nillustrative examples: \u2026 business ethics, values \nand norms. \nGraduates are expected to be able to \ndemonstrate a range of cognitive and \nintellectual skills [and] relevant personal and \ninterpersonal skills.

These include \n\u2026 the capability to \u2026 identify implicit values; \nethics and value management: recognising \nethical situations, applying ethical and \norganisational values to situations and \nchoices. \n  \n \nStatement: AMBA Accreditation of MBA programmes \nType: Voluntary \/ prescriptive \n \nCognitive learning outcomes Affective learning outcomes \nAll programmes should ensure that candidates \nacquire a firm understanding of the major areas \nof knowledge which underpin general \nmanagement, including \u2026 the impact of \nenvironmental forces on organisations, \nincluding: ethical \u2026 issues \u2026 \nNone \n  \n \nStatement: EQUIS European Quality Link (EQUAL) European MBA Guidelines \nType: Voluntary \/ permissive \n \nCognitive learning outcomes Affective learning outcomes \nNone None \n  \n \nStatement: AACSB Accreditation Standards \nType: Voluntary \/ permissive \n \nCognitive learning outcomes Affective learning outcomes \nNormally, the curriculum management processes \nwill result in an undergraduate degree program \nthat includes learning experiences in such \ngeneral knowledge and skills areas as: \u2026 ethical \nSee under cognitive learning outcomes \u2013 \nknowledge and skills are combined \n 6\nunderstanding and reasoning abilities. \nNormally, the curriculum management process \nwill result in undergraduate and master\u2019s level \ngeneral management degree programs that will \ninclude learning experiences in such \nmanagement-specific knowledge and skill areas \nas: ethical \u2026 responsibilities in organizations \nand society. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nGiven that the formulation of the two generalist QAA SBSs was undertaken under the auspices of \nthe Association of Business Schools (ABS)11, and the two groups that produced the SBSs had \noverlapping membership, it is not surprising that some of the language is identical and that there is \na general similarity between the two statements. Both statements give clear expectations of \ncognitive learning outcomes that encompass purpose, governance, environmental and ethical factors \nin the external environment and (as illustrative only) business ethics, values and norms. In terms of \naffective learning outcomes there is commonality in the ability to identify implicit values. But then \na difference emerges with undergraduate programmes expected to focus on diversity, while the \nMasters\u2019 level statement contains a comparatively detailed and forceful affective learning outcome \nconcerning the recognition of ethical issues, the application of ethics and values to situations and \nchoices and the management of ethics and values. This latter set of learning outcomes stands out in \ncomparison with the relatively bland (or absent) statements, not only at undergraduate level but in \nall the other statements. \n \nThe Accounting SBS is disappointing by comparison. It is not even clear that \u201csocial environment\u201d \nunder the cognitive learning outcomes necessarily has anything to do with business or accounting \nethics and there is nothing at all under the affective learning outcomes in the SBS relating to this \narea. Mention of \u201cthe accountancy profession\u201d and \u201cthe business entity\u201d, while not explicit in \nrelation to ethics, might provide an opportunity for relevant ethical issues to be raised, as \nMolyneaux (2004), elsewhere in this special issue, argues. This, however, seems to be left very \nmuch open to individual interpretation. Given events since the publication of this statement in 2000, \nit is possible that a review would lead to a significant change. However, given the then existing and \nsignificant work in social accounting and accountability (see Gray et al., 1996, for example), it is \nsurprising that almost no explicit mention of ethical issues is made. \n \nThe AMBA guidelines contain a very brief statement within the cognitive learning outcomes \nconcerning the impact of ethical issues as an environmental force, but do not give consideration to \nendogenous ethical issues. Nor is there any statement that relates to affective learning outcomes \ndespite reference to more applied learning outcomes, such as the development of transferable skills, \nin other parts of the guidelines. \n \nThe EQUIS guidelines are, in their entirety, less than one side of A4, so it is possible that within \nsuch an abbreviated statement no space could be allotted to a consideration of business ethics. \nNonetheless, their exclusion of both cognitive and affective learning outcomes is clearly out of step \nwith most of the other statements. The guidelines are permissive in the sense that, while generally \n 7\nprescriptive, the omission of any mention of business ethics leaves whether to include it or not \nentirely to the discretion of accredited Business Schools. \n \nFinally, within the AACSB accreditation standards, it is, of course, the inclusion of the word \n\u201cnormally\u201d that leads to their classification as permissive, although it should be noted that this \napplies to all aspects of the curriculum, not just to business ethics. There appears to be an \nassumption that Masters\u2019 level students will already possess general ethical understanding and \nreasoning abilities (presumably from their first degree) and that as a consequence it is only the \nmanagement-specific areas, relating to organisations and society, that require coverage. Otherwise \nthe standards are broadly comparable with the QAA business and management statements, if rather \nless specific. \n \n \nWhither business ethics in the curriculum? \n \nGiven this survey of the current regulatory environment for business ethics in the curriculum, what \nis its import and impact? \n \nFirst, it is worth noting that the content of these statements and guidelines in relation to business \nethics is fairly broad and unspecific. This is probably not surprising, given the nature of these \nstatements. Thus, even where a statement is prescriptive in nature, it leaves a good deal of \ndiscretion to the curriculum designer to interpret the intent and to decide how to implement such an \ninterpretation. As noted above, there are no prescriptions about courses or modules in business \nethics, nor any prescription or advice on the location of such requirements. Whether an integrated \napproach across the curriculum or a focussed approach within a particular module, or a combination \nof the two, is desirable, is left unspecified. Equally, the amount of time to be dedicated to achieving \nthe learning outcomes is not specified. Hence, even the prescriptive QAA SBSs are hardly \nprescriptive in terms of implementation. \n \nFrom an international perspective, therefore, compliance with AACSB standards, while requiring \nboth deliberation and deliberate action, would seem to be relatively straightforward. EQUIS, as \nnoted, has nothing with which to comply. \n \nSecond, from a U.K. perspective, it is probably reasonable to judge that any programme that met \neither of the two QAA SBSs for General Business and Management would meet AMBA and \nAACSB (and, of course, EQUIS) standards at the same time. Given, therefore, that it is the QAA \nSBSs that are mandatory in the U.K. it is appropriate to focus some further attention on these. The \nfact that, for General Business and Management programmes at both undergraduate and \npostgraduate level, there is a mandatory requirement to include something on business ethics within \nthe curriculum, and a requirement to meet both cognitive and affective learning outcomes, is clearly \nan important consideration for curriculum designers.  \n \nAccording to Cowton and Cummins (2003), only 58% of undergraduate and 44% of postgraduate \nU.K. Business Schools have some provision of business ethics12 and in only 16% of undergraduate \nand 17% of postgraduate business schools is it a core provision. This suggests that the introduction \nof SBSs has yet to make a significant impact, although this is not surprising given that they were \nintroduced only in 2000 (2002 for the Masters\u2019 SBS) and the Cummins survey, on which Cowton \n 8\nand Cummins (2003) was based, was conducted in 1999 (Cummins, 1999). Whether, therefore, \nthere will be a marked change as a result of the SBSs remains to be seen. The other option for \ncurriculum designers is not to change the curriculum to reflect the SBSs and rely upon weak \nenforcement from QAA. Given that the interim arrangements for Academic Review and the new \narrangements for Institutional Audit both make specific reference to SBSs as important documents \nagainst which programme specifications should be judged13, this would seem to be a risky strategy.  \n \nOf course, the undergraduate statement applies only to General Business and Management \nprogrammes \u2013 it was estimated within the SBS that it applied to around 50% of all students on \nbusiness and management programmes. Hence inclusion of business ethics in other programmes, \nsuch as marketing or human resource management degrees, is not guaranteed, though they might be \nexpected to look to the General Business and Management benchmark statement as the only \navailable and applicable statement to consider. Accounting programmes are the exception to this \nsince they have their own SBS which, as noted, is disappointing in respect of its overt coverage of \nbusiness ethics. The Masters awards statement, however, applies to all business and management \ndegrees though, as noted in Table 1 above, there is a greater requirement on generalist programmes \nin terms of cognitive learning outcomes. \n \nIt seems possible, therefore, that those who responded to the Cummins survey by suggesting that \nthe teaching of business ethics would increase or increase greatly (76% at undergraduate level and \n87% at postgraduate level), will be proven correct. Certainly, there should be no possibility of \nbusiness ethics withering on the vine. The regulatory environment is generally conducive to such an \nincrease (with Accountancy as the possible exception), led in the U.K. by the introduction of SBSs \nand reinforced by most, though not all, of the voluntary standards that Business Schools may \nchoose to adopt.  \n \nThis, surely, presents both a challenge to curriculum designers and, for those academics working in \nthis area, an opportunity not to be missed. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nComments from participants at the joint Institute of Business Ethics \u2013 EBEN-UK conference \n\u201cTeaching Business Ethics: business ethics in the curriculum\u201d held in November 2003, together \nwith the comments of two reviewers, are gratefully acknowledged. \n 9\nNotes \n \n1.

Other voluntary accreditation of individual programmes is, of course, also available, such as \nthose provided by Accounting, Banking, Personnel, Purchasing and Supply and Marketing \nprofessional bodies. The focus of this paper is generic rather than programme specific \n(excepting the MBA where its ubiquity justifies its inclusion), but where such professional \nbody accreditation is sought, any requirements to incorporate ethics into the curriculum \nwould clearly need to be considered. \n6. While 2 x 2 classification is a common technique in management thought, there are, of \ncourse, both benefits and dangers with any such approach. Cowton (2002) has drawn \nattention to these. The benefits are usually to do with the potential insight that can be \nachieved by simplifying what might otherwise be complex concepts. The dangers are to do \nwith over-simplification \u2013 both in reducing the number of dimensions of an issue to two and \nby then imposing a dichotomous representation rather than a trichotomy or beyond, up to a \ncontinuum. These dangers are acknowledged, and it is not claimed that the 2 x 2 matrix \npresented here represents a true \u201cCarroll diagram\u201d. In particular, the \u201cprescriptive\u201d versus \n\u201cpermissive\u201d dimension will be seen to be not quite so dichotomous as the matrix might \nsuggest, particularly in relation to the QAA SBS for General Business and Management at \nthe undergraduate level. \n7.

Bligh et al. (1999) add a third learning outcome, that of \u201cadaptable occupational skills\u201d \nwhich are developed \u201cby the application of cognition and affect\u201d (p. 7). As such, these \nlearning outcomes are derivative of the other two. Little is included in the documents under \nconsideration about adaptable occupational skills and hence it was deemed appropriate to \nfocus only on the two sets of learning outcomes. \n10.

The Masters awards in business and management SBS divides programmes into specialist \n(Type 1) and generalist, with generalist being further sub-divided into career entry (Type 2) \nand career development (Type 3). Type 3 are MBA-type programmes. \n 10\n12. These are minimum figures based on the assumption that all non-respondents did not teach \nbusiness ethics. Based only on respondents, the figures are as follows, but even with these \nslightly more optimistic figures there is a long way to go before core provision reaches \n100%: \nUndergraduate 22% core, 58% option, 80% total \nPostgraduate  29% core, 45% option, 74% total \n13. The QAA\u2019s Handbook for Academic Review, for example, in giving advice to Reviewers, \nstates, \u201cReviewers will wish to understand how any relevant subject benchmark statements \nhave been used to inform the specification of programmes. However, outcomes for a \nprogramme should be determined through a deliberative process by the institution, they \nshould not simply be copied from a subject benchmark statement. Rather, the benchmark \nstatement should act as a point of reference against which the institution\u2019s own outcomes \nand processes can be reviewed and justified. Benchmark statements should promote \nprofessional dialogue about the educational outcomes of programmes between those \nresponsible for designing, delivering, assessing and assuring programmes\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.qaa.ac.uk\/acrevhbook\/annexd.htm, 22 October 2003). \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAACSB: 2003, \u2018Eligibility procedures and standards for business accreditation\u2019, see \nhttp:\/\/www.aacsb.edu\/accreditation. \n \nAMBA: 2002, \u2018Accreditation of MBA programmes\u2019, see http:\/\/www.mbaworld.com. \n \nBligh, D., H.
