The main\naim of this study is to provide a background for\nunderstanding the hydrological cycle of the British Isles\n(Great Britain and Ireland) using the isotopic approach. Such\na background first requires a knowledge of the isotopic\ncomposition of the input, i.e. rainfall, and this is the subject\nof the present paper (surface waters and groundwater are\nconsidered in Darling et al., 2003). A wider justification is\nto contribute to the global mosaic of data which assists in\nthe modelling of climatic processes (e.g. Jouzel et al., 1997).\nAlthough the weather of the British Isles is often\nconsidered to be dominated by southwest to westerly\nairflows, these actually occur for only about one-third of\nthe average year (Mayes and Wheeler, 1997). While these\nairflows are responsible for the bulk of British Isles rainfall,\nthere is plenty of scope for airflows from other directions\nto contribute to the total rainfall. This makes the British\nW.G. Darling  and J.C. Talbot\n164\nIsles one of the more active areas in which to study the\nvariation of rainfall stable isotopes.\nWhile the monitoring of rainfall isotopes does not occur\non a large scale in the British Isles, sufficient data have now\nbeen amassed to attempt a view of the systematics. This is\nlargely based on data collected by the British Geological\nSurvey (BGS) and the IAEA-WMO GNIP (International\nAtomic Energy Agency \u2013 World Meteorological\nOrganisation Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation)\ndatabase, though results from published studies have also\nbeen included.\n\u0018\b\u000e\t\u000e\u000f\u0003\b\u0004\r\u0012\u0004\u0014\n\r\u0012\u0013\n\f\f\u0004\u001f\u0004\u000b\n\u0010 !\u0014\u000e\u001e\u0012\u001d\nStable isotope data are conventionally expressed in \u2030\n(permil) with respect to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water\n(VSMOW) on the delta scale:\n\u03b4 = [(R\nsample\/Rstandard)-1] x 103 (1)\nwhere R\nsample is the 18O\/16O or 2H\/1H ratio of the sample, and\nR\nstandard the corresponding ratio in VSMOW.\nStable O and H isotope ratios in rainfall are altered\nprimarily by the physical processes of evaporation and\ncondensation in the atmosphere (e.g. Gat, 1980). These result\nin fractionation, the preferential partitioning of isotopes into\nthe liquid and vapour phases. Fractionations may be at\nequilibrium or kinetic depending on circumstances.\nMost rainfall originates from evaporation of the ocean in\ntropical latitudes. Craig (1961) proposed that the relationship\nbetween O and H isotopes in rainfall over most of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface could be approximated by the equation\n\u03b42H = 8\u03b418O + 10 (2)\nThe validity of this \u2018world meteoric line\u2019 (WML) is\nsurprisingly widespread (Gat, 1980; Rozanski et al., 1993)\ngiven the great variations in climate world-wide. The\ncommonly-observed slope of ~8, particularly for temperate\nzone stations, is less than that predicted by the action of an\nequilibrium fractionating process during evaporation from\nthe ocean. This indicates that non-equilibrium (kinetic)\nfractionation and mixing are important factors in the\ndevelopment of the isotopic characteristics of atmospheric\nwater vapour. This is not unexpected given the amount of\natmospheric activity occurring during the creation of vapour\nmasses. The intercept value of 10 is an average figure and\nis related to humidity conditions above the ocean-\natmosphere boundary layer in the moisture source area. The\nvalue varies in theory from 0 at 100% humidity to about 35\nfor 50% humidity (Gonfiantini, 1986), with the value of 10\nrepresenting the global mean of approximately 85%\nhumidity.\nBy contrast, the condensation of atmospheric vapour is\nmuch more of an equilibrium process. Condensation occurs\nwhen the temperature of a particular air mass falls below\nthe dew point, where humidity reaches 100%, as a result of\nadiabatic expansion and\/or heat radiation. At this point rain\ndrops will form, enriched in the heavier isotopes 18O and 2H\nwhile the remaining vapour will be depleted by an amount\ndictated by the mass balance of the rainfall\u2013vapour system.\nAdditional rainfall can only be obtained from the remaining\nvapour if the temperature falls further to regain 100%\nhumidity. A similar split between enriched rain and depleted\nvapour results, but this time from a more depleted total\ncomposition. In reality this tends to be a continuous process\nof the Rayleigh distillation type (Clark and Fritz, 1997).\nThe consequence is that any process resulting in temperature\nloss in a moist air mass leads to progressively more\nisotopically-depleted rainfall. This can take the form of the\n\u2018continental effect\u2019 (movement of the air mass over land)\nor the \u2018altitude effect\u2019 (passage of the air mass over upland\nbarriers).\nIt is not possible to put an exact figure on the effect of\ncondensation temperature change on rainfall isotope ratios\nbecause of the variables involved. Since surface temperature\nchanges will at least to an extent reflect those in air masses,\nthere tends to be a significant degree of correlation between\nrainfall and surface air temperature for isotope collection\nstations (Rozanski et al., 1993; GNIP 2002): this is\ncommonly referred to as the \u2018temperature effect\u2019. In\ntemperate Europe this is normally within the range of  0.2\nto 0.45 \u2030 \u03b418O per \u00b0C, the value generally increasing with\nthe temperature range (\u2018continentality\u2019) of the site.\nAs cloud cooling proceeds precipitation increases and \u03b4\nvalues fall. Additionally, while raindrops tend towards some\nisotopic enrichment as they fall from cloud base to the\nground owing to evaporation and exchange processes, the\nscope for such modification is most limited at high rates of\nrainfall. Both these factors contribute to the so-called\n\u2018amount effect\u2019 observed for most GNIP stations, whereby\nthere is a significant correlation between rainfall amount\nand isotopic depletion.\nWhile for the most part \u03b418O and \u03b42H are highly correlated\nin rainfall, some variation can occur as a result of\natmospheric conditions. A useful index of this is the\ndeuterium excess or d-value (Dansgaard, 1964), defined as:\nd = \u03b42H - 8\u03b418O (3)\nThe d-value is considered to be largely controlled by\nconditions of atmospheric humidity during the vapour-\nThe O & H stable isotopic composition of fresh waters in the British Isles. 1. Rainfall\n165\nforming process, as outlined above. For the WML in Eqn.\n(2), d has a value of 10\u2030. Many temperate-zone collection\nstations have d-values around this figure (IAEA\/GNIP,\n2002), though they can fluctuate seasonally mainly owing\nto changes in humidity in the moisture source area (Merlivat\nand Jouzel, 1979; Johnsen et al., 1989). Under certain\nconditions however, particularly evaporation of seawater\ninto very low-humidity air, d-values exceeding 20\u2030 can be\nproduced (e.g. Gat, 1980). Such conditions are however\nlikely to be restricted to seas adjacent to arid zones such as\nin the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\n\u001b\u0003\b\u001e\f\t\b\u0004\n\u0012\u001d\u0004\u001d\r\b\u0010\u001e\b\b\r\u000e\u0012\nSamples of rainwater were collected in standard gauges.\nThese consist of five-inch (127 mm) brass-rimmed funnels\nwhich direct rainfall into a 1-litre glass bottle below ground\nlevel. Although the surrounding bottle container is otherwise\nwell-sealed, the possibility of evaporation from the bottle\nvia the stem cannot be wholly ruled out, though the stem\nlength (180 mm), internal diameter (7 mm) and the fact that\nthe tip is submerged when > 25 mm of rainfall has\naccumulated all tend to minimise this. Bottles were emptied\ndaily, weekly or monthly as appropriate. For monthly\nsampling extra collections were made if rainfall amounts\nwere high (above 75 mm) to prevent overflow. Samples were\nstored prior to analysis in glass bottles with rubber-lined\nmetal caps. These were of 7 ml and 28 ml capacity for daily\nand monthly rainfall respectively, providing adequate\nsample for the separate analysis of 18O\/16O and 2H\/1H.\nAnalysis was carried out using standard preparation\ntechniques followed by isotope ratio measurement on VG-\nMicromass 602E or Optima mass spectrometers. Analytical\nprecisions are better than \u00b1 0.2 \u2030  for \u03b418O and  \u00b1 2 \u2030  for\n\u03b42H.\n\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0003\u0007\u0007\b\t\n\u0007\u0007\u000b\t\f\u0004\n\u0005\b\r\f\u0003\f\u0004\n\u0005\r\nData from three long-term collection stations are considered:\nthe BGS stations in England at Wallingford, Oxfordshire\n(Appendixes A and B), and Keyworth, Nottinghamshire\n(Appendix C), and the IAEA-WMO station on Valentia\nIsland, Co Kerry, Ireland (GNIP, 2002). Data from short-\nterm stations set up for individual studies are available from\nFleam Dyke, Cambridgeshire (Darling and Bath, 1988),\nDriby, Lincolnshire (Heathcote and Lloyd, 1986), Malham,\nN Yorkshire (Lawler, 1987) and Altnabreac, Caithness (Kay\net al., 1984).

Conceivably, the isotopically\nenriched low-volume samples came from the leading edge\nof the frontal rainfall, while the bulk of the event was\nsampled within the next 24-hour period. This magnitude of\nwithin-event variation has been observed elsewhere in NW\nEurope (Bleeker et al., 1966), and would imply that the large\n\u03b418O differences found were to an extent the product of the\nrelatively coarse sampling interval. The most depleted value,\n\u201314.9\u2030, was obtained for a moderate one-day rainfall event\nin December 1979. While November and February each also\nprovided a day with values in the \u201313 to \u201314\u2030  range, in\nboth cases this was following at least a day with moderate\nrainfall. Therefore, while neither of these depleted rainfall\ndays is particularly large in amount, a basic rain-out effect\nmay be responsible. The most enriched samples had positive\nvalues, with a maximum of +1.4\u2030 in September 1980. The\nevents giving rise to these tended to be low in amount,\nthough not markedly so.\nSome of the most intense rainfall events occur in the\nsummer, probably as a result of discharge from cumulo-\nnimbus formations resulting from convection above a hot\nland surface. In such cases the amount effect might be\nexpected to operate, but there is little evidence that this was\nthe case during the summer of 1980.\nThe year under consideration seems to have been typical\ninsofar as the weighted average of \u20136.8\u2030  was fairly close\nto the long-term average for the site (\u20137.25\u2030, see below).\nThe average fell almost exactly halfway between the\nmaximum and minimum values for the year.\nWinter rainfall tends to be isotopically depleted compared\nto summer rainfall (e.g. Clark and Fritz, 1997). This was\nobserved for the Wallingford site, although the difference\nwas not profound: over the winter half-year September-\nFebruary the weighted average \u03b418O was \u20137.02\u2030 , while\nfrom March to August (summer half-year) it was \u20136.53\u2030.\nThe summer rainfall of 322 mm is virtually identical to the\nwinter of 319 mm.\nPlots of \u03b418O versus amount and mean daily temperature\n(Figs. 3a, b) reveal low correlations even when divided into\nseasonal categories; only the autumn and winter\ntemperatures give a significant relationship. To an extent\nthe data call into question the usefulness of daily sampling;\nthe effort involved could perhaps be devoted more\nbeneficially to (for example) detailed studies of individual\nThe O & H stable isotopic composition of fresh waters in the British Isles. 1.

In addition, the slope is compatible\nwith the 6.8 and 7.2 slopes yielded respectively by the\nValentia and Gr\u00f6ningen (Netherlands) long-term records\n(GNIP, 2002), so is clearly not anomalous for NW Europe.\nMonthly values extend over a maximum range of about 15\u2030\nfor \u03b418O and 100 \u2030 for \u03b42H, though compositions are mostly\nconfined to the ranges of \u20133 to \u201311\u2030  \u03b418O and \u201315 to\n\u201375\u2030 \u03b42H.

Isotopic values are\nrelatively enriched in summer and depleted in winter (Fig.\n7a, b). Despite the good correlation between \u03b418O and \u03b42H\napparent from Fig. 4, the relationship between the two does\nchange seasonally as Fig. 6 implies. This is demonstrated\nby plotting the average deuterium excess (d) value for each\nmonth (Fig. 7c). These dip in summer, which is a\nconsequence of higher relative humidity related to sea\nsurface temperatures in the moisture source areas (e.g.\nMerlivat and Jouzel, 1979; Gat, 1980; Johnsen et al., 1989).\nFurther scrutiny of Fig. 7(a) and (b) reveals that there can\nbe a very large variation in the isotopic composition of\nmonthly rainfall, doubtless due to the many factors\ninfluencing weather in the vicinity of the British Isles. In\nthis context it is perhaps surprising that the least variation\nis seen for April, proverbially a time of showers and the\nmonth least likely to have long continued runs of similar\nweather (Perry, 1976).\nIsotope-amount relationships   There is a low though\nsignificant (P < 0.001) correlation between rainfall amount\nand isotope value at the monthly scale (Fig. 8a), giving rise\nFig. 6.

Rainfall\n169\nat best to a crude version of the amount effect: the tendency\nfor higher amounts of rainfall to be more isotopically\ndepleted. This is not altogether surprising, since the amount\neffect is based at least partly on rainfall intensity rather than\noverall amount (Dansgaard, 1964). Therefore a month with\none or two intense rainfall episodes may have a more\ndepleted composition than a month with several lesser\nevents, even though the latter may have more total rainfall.\nOn the seasonal basis there is overall even worse agreement\n(Fig. 8b), but the months May-October are very well\ncorrelated in the typical amount-effect mode. This fits the\nconcept of summer rainfall being derived much more from\nconvective events than winter rainfall, which is usually\nfrontal in origin.\nYearly weighted means average \u20137.25\u2030  \u03b418O (standard\ndeviation of 0.57) and \u201350.0\u2030  \u03b42H (sd 3.7) for a rainfall of\n597 mm (sd 95).

On the seasonal basis such effects are greatly\nmitigated, resulting in the strong correlation of Fig. 9b. This\nFig. 8.

A smaller\ndataset (1982\u20131992) also exists in which meteorological data\nwere obtained from the Wallingford site automatic weather\nstation to quantify conditions during rainfall events only.\nThis dataset also includes wind direction and velocity. These\ndata are summarised in average monthly form in Table 2.\nA seasonal \u03b418O-T relationship of 0.32\u2030 per \u00b0C is\nobtained from the data in Table 2. This can be compared\nwith the seasonal temperature relationship based on the\nconventional mean monthly temperature over the same 11-\nyear period of 0.22\u2030 per \u00b0C. Thus the use of mean monthly\ntemperature may be leading to an underestimate of \u03b418O-T\nvalue, but with only twelve datapoints per correlation the\nuncertainties are relatively large and the slopes could be\nidentical within error.\nWhile it is apparent from records that most rainfall in the\nBritish Isles originates from a westerly quarter (Fig. 10\nshows a rainfall distribution map), 2-metre wind data suggest\nthat the direction from which Wallingford rainfall arrives\nhas a strong southerly bias (Fig. 11). However, northern\nhemisphere wind direction at ground level may be rotated\nanticlockwise by 10\u00b0 or more relative to winds hundreds of\nmetres above because of Ekman spiral effects (e.g.\nGedzelman, 1985), so the Wallingford results are probably\nnot anomalous. Only February shows a deviation from the\nS-SW segment; the easterly component present is consistent\nwith this month being on average the coldest of the year\n(Table 2). There is almost no correlation between \u03b418O and\nwind direction because the latter is so variable.

Although winds tend to be stronger in the winter when\ntemperatures are lower, the strength of the correlation is\nsomewhat surprising.\nLong-term stations, 1985-1996\nCo-isotopic relationships   The period under consideration\nis defined by the availability of data from the Keyworth\nstation (Appendix C). As varying amounts of data are\nmissing from the Keyworth and Valentia (GNIP, 2002)\nrecords, comparisons with yearly and monthly parameters\nas carried out for Wallingford (see previous section) cannot\nbe performed in an equivalently rigorous way. However\nthere are sufficient data to enable some broader conclusions\nto be drawn.\nFigure 13 shows monthly \u03b418O values for each station from\n1985 to 1996. The similar standard deviations for\nWallingford and Keyworth (2.20 and 2.31\u2030 respectively)\nare consistent with their similar continentality (Tout, 1976).\nThe much lower value of 1.54\u2030 for Valentia reflects its\nmaritime situation. While overall amplitude is greatest for\nWallingford, this is caused by a very few extreme months\n(including May 1990 which is missing from the Keyworth\nrecord), and therefore there is probably little difference\nbetween the  two sites in the long term.\nIn general, the isotopic values from all three stations mimic\neach other with time, though Fig. 13 shows a few occasions\nwhen either of the English stations show an exaggerated\nversion of the other stations\u2019 responses or is out of step\naltogether. Examples include April 1989, May 1990, June\n1995 and November 1996 for Wallingford, and June 1986,\nDecember 1989, March 1995 and April 1996 for Keyworth.\nAs might be expected from the more local nature of rain\nevents during the spring and summer, most of the anomalies\nare from such periods.\n \nr2 = 0.78\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n-10 -8 -6 -4\n\u03b418O \u2030\nW\nin\nd \nve\nlo\ncit\ny \nm\n s\n-\n1\nFig. 12.

Darling  and J.C. Talbot\n172\nYearly-weighted averages are also shown in Fig. 13. Like\nthe longer term Wallingford data considered earlier, these\nare very much damped in comparison with the monthly\ninputs. The differences between the long-term weighted\naverages (Wallingford \u20137.25\u2030 , Keyworth \u20137.78\u2030  and\nValentia         \u20135.70\u2030) can be attributed to a combination of\ntopographic and \u2018continental\u2019 rain-out effects acting on\nmoisture from predominantly west-to-southwesterly\nmoisture sources. The distance Valentia-Wallingford (about\n650 km) is almost identical to Valentia-Keyworth, so the\nextra 0.5\u2030 depletion between Wallingford and Keyworth\ncan plausibly be related to the greater distance travelled over\nland by the average moisture-bearing air mass reaching\nKeyworth, perhaps aided by topographic effects such as\npassage over the uplands of Wales. Since the distribution of\nwind directions is similar for both areas (data from the RAF\nBenson and Glenfield stations of the Meteorological Office),\nthe depletion does not appear to be due to, for example, a\ngreater proportion of wind off the North Sea at Keyworth.\nDelta-plots are shown for the three stations in Fig. 14. To\nmake these more directly comparable, only years where all\nthe stations have at least nine months\u2019 worth of data are\nincluded. This rules out 1985, 1993 and 1994. It is again\napparent that Valentia has a restricted range relative to the\nother stations. Wallingford exhibits a certain amount of\ntailing at the enriched end of its range; these are from\nsummer months mainly with very low rainfall. By contrast,\nKeyworth has one very negative value, April 1996, for which\nthere is no obvious cause from examination of the amount\nand temperature data in Appendix 3; however, unseasonable\nsnow on the 12th or thundery rain on the 20th (Met. Office,\n1996) are possible contenders.\nIsotope-amount relationships   Winter and summer half-\nyear weighted means for the period 1986\u201392 and 1995\u201396\nare given in Table 3. They show that the differences are\ngreatest at Wallingford and decline to almost zero at Valentia.\nThis tends to confirm the influence of continental effects at\nWallingford relative to Valentia suggested by the overall\nrange data in Fig. 13.

The Valentia \u03b418O record varies\nleast, presumably because of the station\u2019s \u2018upwind\u2019 location\nin the dominant southwesterly airflow.

In October all the\nstations gave isotopic results around their 12-month average,\nalthough unlike the other stations Altnabreac had above-\naverage rainfall. In November, rainfall was near-average\nfor all stations and resulted in a near-average isotopic\ncontent, except for Altnabreac which was somewhat\ndepleted.\nWinter   In December the three English stations showed\nvery marked isotopic depletion, while Valentia and\nAltnabreac had near-average compositions.

Darling  and J.C. Talbot\n174\nLog summarises this month as \u2018exceptionally cold and\nsnowy\u2019. Snow, although not usually very significant in\namount compared to winter rainfall in the British Isles,\ngenerally has a depleted isotopic composition because, being\nfrozen, there is much less scope for exchange or re-\nequilibration during its descent from the cloud base (e.g.\nGat, 1980). Much of the snow was associated with a\ndepression moving across northern France which resulted\nin heavy falls in central and southern Britain. This may be\nwhy Valentia and Altnabreac were little affected. In January\nthe stations gave isotopic results mostly close to the year\u2019s\naverage, although rainfall was somewhat higher than\naverage at Valentia and Malham. In February rainfall was\nlow at all stations except Valentia, where it was very high.\nDespite this, all stations gave near-average isotopic\ncompositions.\nSpring   In March, Valentia and the English stations\ncontinued to be isotopically similar to February, but\nAltnabreac showed a large depletion apparently unrelated\nto rainfall amount. This may have been due to the snowfall\nin the northern part of Britain around 10 March. In April,\nlow rainfalls for all stations were accompanied by above-\naverage isotopic values. This presumably resulted from the\ngeneral warming of the atmosphere after the winter period.\nIn May the isotopic situation for April continued similarly\nfor Valentia, Wallingford and Fleam Dyke, despite higher\nrainfall. However, depletions were noted for the more\nnortherly stations. This may have been due to a fairly deep\ndepression moving east near northern Scotland early in the\nmonth.\nSummer   In June rainfall amounts were near average except\nfor Altnabreac, which was well below normal. This situation\nwas mirrored by stable isotope contents, which remained\nsimilar to May\u2019s except for Altnabreac which was\nsignificantly enriched. In July all stations gave isotopic\nresults similar to June\u2019s, even though rainfall amounts\ndropped considerably at Malham and Valentia. Finally, in\nAugust the English stations and Valentia remained\nisotopically similar, despite sizeable increases in amount\nfor Valentia and Malham but not Wallingford and Fleam\nDyke. Altnabreac became significantly depleted in spite of\na relatively modest increase in rainfall. This may be\nattributable to the northerly-tracking depressions typical  the\nBritish summer.\nWhatever the causes for differences between the stations,\nit is clear that in this maritime area there are many factors\nwhich may influence the isotopic composition of rainfall.\nOn a monthly basis it is difficult to ascribe measured\ncompositions to individual weather events, at least without\nknowing much more about the pattern of rainfall during the\nmonth. Only four months provide isotope-amount\ncorrelations significant above the 85% level: Fig. 17 shows\nthat December and January are positive while May and June\nare negative. The gradient reversals may be explained in\nthe following terms: in winter, moisture-bearing fronts\ndeliver rainfall influenced by the continental effect, whereby\nfrontal rainfall becomes progressively depleted in 18O as it\nFig. 16.

Rainfall\n175\npasses across the British Isles while decreasing in amount.\nIn summer, by contrast, rainfall events of significant volume\nappear to be much more convective in origin, and the amount\neffect comes into play, with the higher-volume events being\nassociated with more 18O depletion. In the intervening\nseasons both types of rainfall occur, thus reducing the\namount of correlation.\nThese regional data broadly resemble the long-term\nmonthly data from Wallingford (Fig. 8b), particularly the\nstrong negative correlation (i.e. amount effect) for the\nsummer months. Since temperature data are not available\nfor one of the stations (Altnabreac), comparisons with\ntemperature would be of more limited value and have\ntherefore not been attempted.\n\u0003\u0007\f\u0004\f\u0010\u0011\u000b\b\u000b\u0006\u0006\u000b\t\f\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the so-called altitude effect is really a\nlocal form of the temperature effect and results from the\ncooling of air masses as they gain altitude. The measured\neffects of altitude on the stable isotopic composition of\nrainfall range from \u20130.15 to \u20135\u2030 for \u03b418O per 100 m increase\nin elevation, with \u03b42H varying in proportion (limited\nworldwide data summarised in Clark and Fritz, 1997). For\nthe lowland areas of Britain the effect is likely to be of little\nsignificance, and can be ruled out as a significant factor in\ndifferences between the collection stations considered above.\nIn upland areas, however, relief of hundreds of metres\nimplies significant isotopic effects on rainfall. To obtain an\nindication of the scale of the effect in the British Isles, a\nsmall study was carried out in the southern Highlands of\nScotland.\nThe Monachyle surface water catchment near\nBalquhidder, Tayside (Johnson and Whitehead, 1993)\nprovided sampling points at different elevations within the\napproximately 6 km2 catchment. Bulked monthly samples\nwere collected from raingauges over a 300 m altitude range\non four occasions over the course of approximately one year.\nThe data are plotted against altitude in Fig. 18. The\nregression lines show altitude effects of about \u20130.3\u2030 \u03b418O\nper 100 m in winter, and \u22120.2 \u2030 \u03b418O  per 100 m in summer.\nWhile the regressions are not particularly well correlated,\nprobably due in part to the varying positions of collectors\naround the catchments, these gradients are consistent with\nthose observed elsewhere in the world (an average of\n\u20130.28\u2030 for \u03b418O according to Poage and Chamberlin, 2001).\nThe poorer correlations in summer may reflect the\ndominance of local shower events compared to the large-\nscale frontal movements characteristic of winter.\n\t\u0007\u0004\u000e\u0003\f\u0004\t\b\u000b\u0006\u0006\u000b\t\f\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing discussion that the isotopic\ncontent of rainfall over the British Isles is strongly influenced\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nAu\ng-\n81\nSe\np-\n81\nO\nct\n-8\n1\nN\nov\n-8\n1\nD\nec\n-8\n1\nJa\nn-\n82\nFe\nb-\n82\nM\nar\n-8\n2\nAp\nr-8\n2\nM\nay\n-8\n2\nJu\nn-\n82\nJu\nl-8\n2\nAu\ng-\n82\nSe\np-\n82\nCo\nrr\ne\nla\ntio\nn \nco\nef\nft.\n r2\nFig. 17.

Darling  and J.C. Talbot\n176\nby short-term changes in factors such as temperature, rainfall\namount and air-mass movement \u2014 in other words, weather.\nHowever, these factors also affect the isotopic balance of\nrainfall over the longer term in the form of climate. For\ninstance, various studies of palaeo-groundwaters\n(\u2018palaeowaters\u2019) show that rainfall in the British Isles during\nthe late Pleistocene must have had more negative isotopic\ncompositions than at the present day (e.g. Darling et al.,\n1997).  The connection between stable isotope values and\ntemperature is only relative and may to some extent have\nchanged over time in the British Isles. However, the absolute\ntemperatures derived from the temperature-dependent\nsolubility relationships of the noble gases (neon, argon,\nkrypton and xenon) dissolved in the palaeowaters confirm\na significant drop in recharge temperature for the\npalaeowaters. While ice-core evidence indicates that some\ntemperature changes during the late-Pleistocene to early-\nHolocene climatic transition may have been rapid, they\nwould still probably have occurred over tens of years rather\nthan a shorter timescale (e.g. Taylor et al., 1993). This might\nhave been difficult enough to detect isotopically at the time;\nthe prevalence of more stable conditions at the present day\nmeans that the chances of detecting secular isotopic changes\non a decadal scale must now be even smaller.\nFor example, global warming in the late 20th century is\nestimated to be occurring on a scale of around 0.15\u00b0C per\ndecade in the northern hemisphere (UEA-CRU, 2002).\nGiven the current \u03b418O-T effect of around 0.25\u2030 per \u00b0C for\n\u03b418O for Wallingford, this would translate into a raising of\n\u2018baseline\u2019 \u03b418O by only 0.04\u2030 per decade, a figure rather\nbeyond the ability of present-day analytical precision to\ndetect convincingly even before the diverse meteorological\ninfluences are considered. Even if the magnitude of the \u03b418O-\nT effect were doubled to reflect the probable magnitude of\nthe secular relationship (Rozanski, 1993) the resulting\nincrease would still be obscured. Further, this assumes that\nthe temperature of the ocean source area remains constant;\nif this also rises any baseline increase will tend towards zero,\nbecause isotopic depletion depends on the difference in\ntemperature between moisture source area and sampling site.\nWhile detection of baseline changes can therefore be ruled\nout in the shorter term, one probable consequence of global\nwarming, the increased frequency of climatic extremes\n(Houghton et al., 1996), might be expected to have an\ninfluence on the isotopic composition of rainfall. Fig. 5\nshows that the annual weighted mean for \u03b418O at Wallingford\nhas become less stable since the mid-1990s, this period\nincluding the record-breaking rainfall in the autumn-winter\nof 2000\u201301. As with other indicators, prolonged observation\nwill be required to determine whether such fluctuations are\nother than random variation.\nIt is possible to seek more specific climatic links, for\nexample with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This is\na phenomenon indexed on the difference in barometric\npressure between Iceland and the Azores or Gibraltar, and\nis considered to have an important effect on European\nclimate (e.g. Rodwell et al., 1999). Positive values of the\nindex are associated with strong winter westerlies in northern\nEurope, bringing heavy rainfall and relatively warm\nconditions. By contrast, negative values result in more\ncontinental conditions with lower rainfall and colder\ntemperatures. While plots of annual NAO index against \u03b418O\nshow overall a poor correlation both for Wallingford and\nValentia (Fig. 19), for Wallingford the negative NAO values\nare well correlated. This correlation is consistent insofar as\n\u03b418O would be expected to be more depleted in colder\nconditions, i.e. those with the most negative NAO index.\nAlso, an inland station such as Wallingford might be\nexpected to demonstrate the effect more than a station on\nthe edge of the Atlantic like Valentia.

Rainfall\n177\ninterpretation is the fact that \u03b418O values can be often be\njust as depleted during positive NAO years.\nOn a more local scale but of potential relevance to this\nstudy, Kiely et al. (1998) carried out a study of the Valentia\nrainfall record that revealed a 10% increase in mean annual\nprecipitation commencing around 1975, with most of the\nincrease occurring in the months of March and to a lesser\nextent October. This might have been detectable in the\nisotopic record, but unfortunately while they extend back\nto 1960, the data for the years around 1975 are particularly\nfragmentary. This rules out any statistically meaningful\ncomparison of March weighted averages for the years before\nand after 1975.\n\u0012\u0002\n\u0013\u0014\b\u0002\u000b\t\n\u0002\u0011\r\nDirectly measured rainfall stable isotope records go back a\nmaximum of only 40 years or so (e.g. for Valentia). It is\nwell established that, under favourable circumstances, ice\ncores can preserve the isotopic content of rainfall at high\nlatitudes and\/or altitudes, but neither of these conditions\napplies in the British Isles at the present day. The \u03b418O values\nof biogenic carbonate and opal in lake sediments have been\nused to infer the isotopic content of rainfall (e.g. von\nGrafenstein et al., 1996; Shemesh and Peteet, 1998), but\naside from any difficult-to-quantify variables such as the\neffect of evaporation during drier spells, these techniques\nare usually difficult to apply at the annual scale. For example,\nvon Grafenstein et al. (ibid) claim a three- to five-year\nresolution.\nThe \u03b418O content of tree-ring cellulose has also been used\nto infer rainfall isotope values. Although this technique is\nalso affected by environmental variables, it does permit\nresolution at the annual scale. Robertson et al. (2001) found\na good correlation between the \u03b418O values of cellulose from\noak trees in East Anglia and rainfall of the previous\nDecember\/January period at Wallingford. Further work on\nthis topic seems the most likely way in which the rainfall\nrecord for the British Isles could be extended back on an\nannual basis, if only for selected months of the year.\n\"\u000e\u0012\u0010\f\u001e\b\r\u000e\u0012\b\nRainfall isotope data for the British Isles have been\ninvestigated over a variety of timescales and locations.\nOne year\u2019s worth of daily data from the Wallingford\ncollection station exhibits sometimes large fluctuations in\nisotope values over short periods of time. Correlations with\nmeteorological parameters are not straightforward to\ninterpret, but a detailed study at the synoptic scale (beyond\nthe scope of the present paper) remains to be made.\nLong-term monthly data, particularly from Wallingford\nbut also from Keyworth and Valentia, reveal the relative\nstability of bulk \u03b418O and \u03b42H on a year-to-year basis and\nalso seasonal relationships with temperature and rainfall\namount at the individual stations. While Valentia shows the\nleast monthly isotopic variation, generally isotopic changes\nfor each station mimic those of the other two. However the\nmonthly record of a larger number of collection stations\ncovering a greater area of the British Isles demonstrates\nrather more changeability but also shows a more consistent\nseasonal change in amount effect.\nMeasurements within the Monachyle upland catchment\nin the southern Highlands of Scotland show altitude effects\nvarying seasonally but remaining well within the range\nencountered elsewhere in the world.\nShort-to-medium term climatic effects on rainfall isotopes\nare difficult to demonstrate convincingly. There is no\nprospect of detecting the underlying influence of global\nwarming over the comparatively short datasets available,\nbut more rapid changes such as the North Atlantic\nOscillation may under certain conditions be reflected in\nisotopic compositions.\nAn indication of the isotopic composition of winter rainfall\nprior to direct measurement may be inferred from the\nisotopic content of tree ring cellulose.\n\u001c\u0010 \u0012\u000e\u0015\f\u0003\u001d!\u0011\u0003\u0012\t\b\nPast and present BGS colleagues Adrian Bath and Jerry\nHodgson are thanked for the collection of the Keyworth\nrainfall samples, as are Sam Boyle and Dick Johnson of the\nNERC Institute of Hydrology (now CEH Wallingford) for\nthe Fleam Dyke and Monachyle samples, respectively.
