Low frequency UDD\ncan be readily scaled up, allowing for the application\nof UDD not only in laboratory conditions but also on\nan industrial scale.\nINTRODUCTION\nTransferring DNA to cells is a fundamental technique of\nmolecular cloning, which has revolutionized molecular\nbiology. In clinical practice, gene therapy and RNAi rescue\nis dependent on the success of DNA\/RNA delivery (1).\nHowever, in environmental microbiology, the vast major-\nity of prokaryotes (>99%) in natural environments are\nunculturable (2), and therefore not amenable to DNA\ndelivery using traditional culture-dependent DNA deliv-\nery methods. Even when prokaryotes can be cultured\nin vitro, genetic manipulation is frequently impeded\nbecause of the lack of efficient, non-invasive and simple\nmethods for DNA delivery. Efficient transfer of DNA to\nnatural microbial communities, such as those found in\ngroundwater and soils, could be used to rapidly\nintroduce novel gene functions, and therefore change\nthe structure and functionality of microbial communities.\nDelivery of regulatory genes or small regulatory RNA\n(sRNA) could be used to silence bacterial genes and alter\nbacterial behaviour, and sRNA and regulatory genes\nhave the potential to be used as novel antibiotics against\nmultidrug-resistant bacteria, or to inhibit bacterial\nbiofilm formation (3). Therefore, a simple and efficient\nDNA\/RNA delivery system is essential for the successful\napplication of all of these technologies.\nBiological methods for bacterial DNA transfer include\nconjugation, gene transformation and transduction (4\u20138).\nBiological methods such as conjugation and transduction\nusually require a specific DNA donor or host strain to\nachieve bacterial DNA transfer (6), while gene transfor-\nmation is limited to a few naturally competent groups (8).\nPhysical methods for gene transfer include microinjection,\nparticle bombardment, electroporation, laser irradiation\nand sonoporation (9). Microinjection and particle bom-\nbardment are interference techniques: they directly pene-\ntrate the cell membrane to introduce nucleic acids into\ncells (9). Laser irradiation employs a laser to change cell\npermeability and allows DNA to be transferred (9,10),\nbut requires physical contact of laser and cells. Most of\nthese physical techniques are only applied to small- scale\nsamples of eukaryotic cells. In practice, the most\ncommonly used methods for bacterial gene transfer are\nPresent address:\nWei E.

The\nmechanism of UDD is primarily based upon a cavitational\neffect, which physically generates reversible porosity in the\ncell membrane (22\u201324). UDD has several advantages that\nmake it an attractive technique for DNA delivery. First,\nUDD can, in theory, deliver DNA or RNA to any type\nof cell including bacteria (25), fungi, plants (26) and\nmammalian cells (16,18,19,21,27,28). Second, UDD does\nnot require ion-free media, and therefore can be applied to\ncells growing in natural media or human body fluids.\nThird, UDD is a non-invasive method, which does not\nrequire direct physical contact. However, in all previous\nstudies, the ultrasound frequency used for transferring\nDNA was in the ranges of 1\u20133MHz (16\u201321). Such\nfrequencies have worked well with eukaryotic cells but\nthe efficiency of bacterial transformation at these frequen-\ncies is low compared to conventional methods for\nbacterial transformation (25).\nWe report here that a standard low frequency (40 kHz)\nultrasound clean bath can be used to successfully and\nefficiently deliver plasmid pBBR1MCS2 into Pseudomonas\nputida UWC1. Optimized conditions gave a delivery effici-\nency of 9.8\u0002 2.3\u0001 10\u00036 transformants per cell, which was\nsignificantly higher than the results of conjugation and\neven electroporation. We have also successfully trans-\nferred pBBR1MCS2 to Escherichia coli DH5a and\nPseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 with 1.16\u0002 0.13\u0001 10\u00036\nand 4.33\u0002 0.78\u0001 10\u00036 transformants per cell. Low\nfrequency UDD has several advantages over high\nfrequency UDD and other transformation methods for\nindustrial and environmental applications. Low frequency\nUDD can be used to transform bacteria at room\ntemperature and in a wide range of media. Furthermore,\nultrasonic apparatus operating in the frequency range of\n20\u201340 kHz can be readily scaled up, allowing for the\napplication of UDD on large scales, for example,\nintroducing DNA to natural microbial communities in\norder to promote enhanced biodegradation of pollutants\nin groundwater or wastewater treatment plants.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nChemicals and media\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co., UK\nand were analytical-grade reagents unless otherwise\nstated. Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium was used for the\ncultivation of bacteria. SOC medium (29) was used to\nrecover antibiotic-resistant cells after electroporation and\nUDD. Ampicillin and rifampicin were used at a final\nconcentration of 100 mg\/ml. Fifty microgram per millilitre\nof kanamycin was used with E. coli DH5a and P. putida\nUWC1 and 100 mg\/ml with P. fluorescens SBW25. LB agar\ncontaining 100mg\/ml rifampicin (LBR) was used to obtain\ntotal cell counts of P. putida UWC1. LB agar with 50 and\n100 mg\/ml kanamycin (LBK) was used to select for\ntransformants of E. coli DH5a and P. fluorescens\nSBW25. LBK supplemented with 100mg\/ml rifampicin\n(LBKR) was used to identify and count P. putida UWC1\ntransformants carrying pBBR1MCS2.\nBacteria and plasmids\nE. coli DH5a, P. putida UWC1 and P. fluorescens SBW25\nwere used as recipients of plasmid. P. putida UWC1 is a\nspontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant of P. putida\nKT2440 (30). The broad-host-range cloning vector\npBBR1MCS2 (5144 bp) (31,32), hosted in E. coli JM109\n(pBBR1MCS2) was employed as delivery DNA. Plasmid\nDNA was extracted and purified from overnight cultures\nof E. coli JM109, DH5a, P. putidaUWC1 or P. fluorescens\nSBW25 using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (QIAGEN,\nUK). DNA concentration was determined using a\nGeneQuant Pro RNA\/DNA calculator (Amersham\nPharmacia Biotech, USA).\nUltrasound apparatus\nTwo different ultrasound systems were used with a\nfrequency of either 40 or 850 kHz. The 40 kHz ultrasound\napparatus was a standard ultrasonic cleaning bath 375H\n(Langford Electronics Ltd., Coventry, UK) with a\nmaximal electrical energy output of 75W. The ultrasound\nwater bath dimension was 240\u0001 135\u0001 100 (mm,\nL\u0001W\u0001H). The higher frequency ultrasound apparatus\nwas an 850 kHz ultrasonic bath (Meinhart\nUltraschalltechnik, Germany, K80-5) connected to a\ntransducer. The K80-5 generator could generate ultra-\nsound at four intensities, with a maximal electrical energy\noutput of 140W.\nUltrasound may have a heating effect, so temperature\nwas monitored throughout the experiments using a Digital\nTest Thermometer (Brannan Thermometers, UK).\nTo determine the ultrasound power in the plasmid\ntransfer system, the temperature (T) was recorded against\ntime (t), at 15 s intervals, over a period of 4min using a\nthermocouple placed in the reaction itself. From the T\nversus t data, the temperature rise at zero time (dT\/dt),\ncan be estimated by either constructing a tangent to the\ncurve at time=0, or by curve fitting the data to a\npolynomial in t. The ultrasonic power actually entering\nthe system can be obtained from this by substituting the\nvalue of (dT\/dt), at time zero (obtained from either\nmethod) into the following equation (33):\nPower \u00bc dTcpM\ndt\n1\nwhere cp is heat capacity of the solvent (J\/kg\/K) andM the\nmass of solvent used (kg).\nPower measurements were achieved using the 1.75-ml\nflat-bottom glass vial (Richardsons of Leicester Ltd., UK).\ne129 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 19 PAGE 2 OF 9\nUltrasound plasmid transfer\nAll experiments were conducted with 5\u201324 replicates and\nmeans\u0002 SE are presented. Statistical tests were performed\nusing Excel (Microsoft, Inc.). Prior to transformation,\nsingle colonies of P. putida UWC1, E. coli DH5a or\nP. fluorescens SBW25 were inoculated and incubated in\n10ml LB broth for 13\u201315 h at 288C, washed three times in\n0.85% NaCl and then resuspended in 10-ml transforma-\ntion medium. One, three or five hundred microlitre\nsolutions of P. putida UWC1, 500ml of E. coli DH5a or\nP. fluorescens SBW25 cells and plasmid pBBR1MCS2\nwere mixed and transferred to 1.75-ml flat-bottom glass\nvials (Richardsons of Leicester Ltd., UK). The vials were\nplaced in the centre of the 375H ultrasound bath. The vials\nwere fully immersed in the ultrasound water bath, which\ncontained 1.6 l of tap water, and exposed to 40 kHz\nultrasound. Unless otherwise stated, cell concentrations\nwere 108\u20139 CFU (colony forming unit)\/ml, the final\nconcentration of plasmid applied to UDD was 0.8 ng\/ml\ncells, ultrasound exposure time was 10 s and UDD was\ncarried out at 21.5\u201322.98C throughout the experiments.\nAfter ultrasound treatment, 900 ml SOC medium were\nadded to 100 ml reaction mixture. Cells were incubated in a\n288C incubator with 150 r.p.m. shaking for 2 h. Cells were\ndiluted and plated onto appropriate media to obtain cell\ncounts.\nTo attempt plasmid transfer to P. putida UWC1at\n850 kHz K80-5, vials containing 100ml reaction mixture\n(108 CFU\/ml and 0.8 ng\/ml of plasmid pBBR1MCS2) were\nplaced at the centre of the ultrasound bath. The exposure\ntime of UDD was 5\u201330 s for each intensity of constant\nultrasound, and 30 s for ultrasound pulse. Temperature\nwas controlled and maintained at 208C by cycling cooling\nwater.\nThe effect of UDD on plasmid integrity. To examine the\neffect of ultrasound on plasmids, vials containing 80 ng of\npBBR1MCS2 DNA in 100 ml of 100mM CaCl2 solution\nwere separately exposed to 40 kHz ultrasound for 0, 5, 10,\n30, 30 and 60 s. After ultrasound treatment, each sample\nwas transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and added\nto 10 ml 3M sodium acetate, 200 ml absolute ethanol\nand 1 ml glycogen. Samples were incubated on ice for\n30min and then centrifuged at 163 000g for 10min.\nThe supernatant was removed and the DNA pellet was\ndried in an Eppendorf Concentrator 5301 (Hamburg,\nGermany) for 10min. The DNA pellet was then resus-\npended in 10 ml deionized water. The recovered plasmid\nDNA was examined by agarose-ethidium bromide gel\nelectrophoresis.\nMedium effect on UDD efficiencies. To assess medium\neffect on UDD, three times saline washed P. putida\nUWC1 cells were mixed with plasmid DNA and resus-\npended in four different types of media: LB medium,\nphosphate buffer solution (PBS), 100mM MgSO4 and\n100mM CaCl2.\nSince CaCl2 was found to enhance ultrasound plasmid\ntransfer, it was then further investigated by performing\nUDD in CaCl2 with final concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 50,\n100, 200, 300 or 500mM.\nTemperature effect on UDD efficiencies. To determine the\ntemperature effect, UDD was performed at 0, 22, 28 and\n428C.\nPlasmid concentration and UDD efficiencies. UDD was\ncarried out with plasmid DNA at final concentrations of 0,\n0.08, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 5 or 8 ng\/ml cells.\nCells concentration and UDD efficiencies. UDD was\ncarried out at cell concentrations of 107, 108 and\n109CFU\/ml.\nUDD of E. coli DH5\u0001 and P. fluorescens SBW25. The\nUDD conditions for E. coli DH5a and P. fluorescens\nSBW25 were: 10 s exposure time, 50mM CaCl2, 228C,\n1 ng\/ml plasmid DNA of pBBR1MCS2 and cell con-\ncentrations of E. coli DH5a 5.8\u0001 108CFU\/ml and\nP. fluorescens SBW25 1.1\u0001 109CFU\/ml. The total reac-\ntion volume was 500 ml.\nConjugation and electroporation\nElectroporation and conjugation were used as positive\ncontrols for plasmid transformation of P. putida UWC1.\nFor electroporation, an overnight culture of P. putida\nUWC1 was washed three times and resuspended in\n10% glycerol. Electroporation used similar conditions\nto the optimized conditions reported by Cho et al. (34).\nFifty microlitres of cell suspension and 1 ml plasmid\n(27 ng\/ml) were mixed in 0.2-cm electroporation cuvettes\nand electroporated under conditions of 12.5 kV\/cm\nand 25 mFD using a Bio-rad gene pulser (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, UK). Cells were mixed with 950 ml of SOC\nimmediately after electroporation and cells were incubated\nfor 2 h at 288C. For conjugation, 50 ml of an overnight\nculture of P. putida UWC1 (109 cells\/ml) and 50 ml of\nan overnight culture of E. coli JM109 (109 cells\/ml),\nharbouring pBBR1MCS2, were mixed by vortexing for\n10 s and loaded onto an 0.2-mm GTBP membrane filter\n(Millipore, UK) and then placed on a LB agar plate.\nCell were incubated for 16 h incubation at 288C, and\nthen washed from the filters and recovered. After\nelectroporation or conjugation, cells were plated on\nLBR and LBKR plates to obtain total cell and transfor-\nmant counts.\nDNAmanipulation and sequencing\nUltrasound transformants of P. putida UWC1, E. coli\nDH5a and P. fluorescens SBW25 (pBBR1MCS2) were\nverified by plasmid digestion, plasmid sequencing and 16S\nDNA sequencing of recipient cells. Ten transformants of\neach species were randomly selected from different batches\nof LBK plates and streaked on fresh LBK plates. Single\ncolonies were picked from each fresh LBK plate and\ninoculated into LBK liquid medium. Plasmid DNA\nextracted from P. putida UWC1, E. coli DH5a and\nP. fluorescens SBW25 (pBBR1MCS2) and from original\nhost E. coli JM109 was digested with NotI endonuclease\n(New England Biolabs, UK), and analysed using a 1%\nPAGE 3 OF 9 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 19 e129\nagarose-ethidium bromide gel. For further confirmation,\nplasmids were sequenced using primer BBR1_for (50-CCG\nAAG CCC AAC CTT TCA TAG AA-30).\n16S DNA of P. putida UWC1 transformants was\namplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cells\nfrom a single colony as a DNA template. The universal\n16S primers for PCR were forward 63f (50-CAG GCC\nTAA CAC ATG CAA GTC-30) and reverse 530r (50-GTA\nTTA CCG CGG CTG CTG-30). PCR amplifications were\nperformed with initial denaturation at 958C for 5min,\nfollowed by 35 cycles of 958C for 1min, 608C for 1min\nand 728C for 1min and a final additional 728C for 10min\nextension. PCR products were isolated from a 1% agarose\ngel and purified according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen\nCo., UK). 16S PCR products were sequenced using\nprimer 63f.\nNucleotide sequencing and sequence analysis\nAll DNA samples (PCR products or plasmids) were\nsequenced using dye terminator sequencing on an Applied\nBiosystems 3730 DNA analyzer, according to the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA sequence analysis was\ncarried out using Blastn for confirmation of sequence\nhomology and sequence data were aligned and edited\nusing BioEdit to confirm correct insertions (Tom Hall,\nDepartment of Microbiology, North Carolina State\nUniversity).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nLow frequency ultrasound treatment promotes DNA delivery\ninto bacterial cells\nAlthough high frequency (>200 kHz) ultrasound has been\nreported to promote DNA transfer into mammalian\ncells (9,16\u201321), we found that high frequency 850 kHz\nultrasound failed to deliver plasmid pBBR1MCS2 into\nP. putida UWC1 (data not shown). However, low\nfrequency 40 kHz ultrasound did promote the transfer of\nplasmid pBBR1MCS2 into P. putida UWC1 (Figure 1A).\nWe observed no transfer of plasmid DNA into P. putida\nUWC1 in the absence of exposure to ultrasound\n(Figure 1A), which excludes the possibility that transfor-\nmation was due to natural competence. In all UDD\nexperiments, we used flat-bottom glass vials. Plastic\nvessels can absorb ultrasound energy and round and\nsmooth bottom vials reflect ultrasound, making the\nefficiency of UDD low (data not shown). As the\nultrasound generator was set at the bottom of the 375H\nultrasonic cleaning bath, the alignment of glass vials and\ngenerator is critical. We tried nine different positions\nand found that the efficiency of UDD at the centre point\nof the 375H water bath was higher than other points.\nTherefore, all UDD experiments were carried out by\npositioning a single vial at the centre point of the 375H\nbath. The ultrasound power at the centre point of\nthe 375H bath was calculated using Equation (1), as\ndescribed in materials and methods, to be 240mW\/cm2 in\neach vial.\nUltrasound exposure time affects cell viability,\nplasmid integrity and UDD\nThe damage to cells which is generally associated with\nultrasonic energy was first recorded in 1929 in a study of\nBacillus fisheri in sea water (35).

Exposure time of 10 s gives the highest\ntransfer efficiency. No plasmid transfer occurred in the absence of\nultrasound treatment. (B) Ultrasound reduced P. putida UWC1 survival\nfollowing 60 s exposure time, but shorter treatments had little effect on\nbacterial survival (P< 0.05).

Indeed\nultrasound has been studied as a possible method for\nwater disinfection (36). Now evidence is emerging that\ncontrolling the power of sonication can lead to beneficial,\nnon-lethal, effects on biological activity e.g. the promotion\nof bioreactor efficiency (37,38). In our experiments\nprolonged exposure of P. putida UWC1 to 40 kHz for\nmore than 60 s efficiently killed bacterial cells (Figure 1B),\nwhich is to be expected as low frequency ultrasound has\nbeen used for cell lysis and disruption (39\u201341). Exposure\ntimes of less than 30 s did not significantly reduce cell\nviability (Figure 1B). Interestingly, exposure time of 10 s\nresulted in higher colony counts in viability assays, which\nmay be due to the short ultrasound treatment separating\nand dispersing clumped cells (Figure 1B).\nExposure of plasmids to ultrasound for 30 or 60 s\nsignificantly damaged plasmid integrity and sheared\nplasmids into fragments (Figure 1C), which is in good\nagreement with observations carried out by Grokhovsky\n(42). However, plasmid exposure times less than 10 s did\nnot affect plasmid integrity, as assessed by gel electro-\nphoresis (Figure 1C).\nOccasionally, plasmids with 30 and 60 s ultrasound\nexposures (Figure 1C, lanes 11 and 13) were not\ncompletely sheared; later examination indicated that in\nthose cases the bottoms of vials and 375H were not\nparallel, and some the ultrasound energies might be\nreflected. Therefore, in order to efficiently transport\nultrasound energy to the cell\u2013plasmid mixtures, the flat\nbottom of vials should be parallel with the bottom of\n375H ultrasonic cleaning bath.\nThe results of cell viability and plasmid integrity assays\nare in good agreement with UDD result (Figure 1), which\nshowed that plasmid transfer occurred at a high frequency\nfollowing ultrasound treatments of 5\u201330 s. Since 30 s\nultrasound exposure time damaged plasmid DNA\n(Figure 1C) and 5 s exposure time gave relatively variable\nresults (Figure 1A), all subsequent experiments were\nperformed with a 10 s ultrasound treatment.\nConfirmation of plasmid delivery toP. putidaUWC1,\nE. coliDH5a and P. fluorescens SBW25\nWe randomly picked 10 ultrasound-transformants of each\nspecies: P. putida UWC1, E. coli DH5a or P. fluorescens\nSBW25 to confirm that kanamycin resistance arose as a\nresult of UDD. Ten transformants of each species were\nconfirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing of each colony, which\nconfirmed that all 10 transformants had identical 16S\nrDNA to P. putida UWC1, E. coli DH5a or P. fluorescens\nSBW25. Plasmid DNA was extracted from each of the 10\ntransformants. The plasmids isolated from ultrasound\ntransformants P. putida UWC1 (Figure 2), E. coli DH5a\nand P. fluorescens SBW25 (data not shown) were digested\nwith NotI and compared with pBBR1MCS2 and con-\nfirmed they had identical structures. Finally, the plasmids\nwere partially sequenced and the results confirmed that\nthey were pBBR1MCS2.\nAddition of calcium chloride to DNA transfer media\nsignificantly enhances UDD\nWe tested the effect of four different media on UDD\nefficiency, with P. putida UWC1 as the recipient strain:\nLB, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), MgSO4 and CaCl2,\nrespectively. Only CaCl2 had a significant effect on UDD\n(data not shown). CaCl2 concentrations lower than\n10mM or greater than 500mM had no significant effect\non UDD (Figure 3). The optimal CaCl2 concentration for\nUDD was 50mM CaCl2 (Figure 3).\nLanger and colleagues suggested that the mechanism of\nsonophoresis with low frequency ultrasound, such as\n20 kHz, is primarily due to cavitational effects (43\u201345).\nWe propose a mechanism of ultrasound-mediated plasmid\ntransfer of bacteria in which plasmid transfer is enhanced\nin the presence of CaCl2 (Figure 4): Plasmid DNA and\nbacteria are initially well-mixed in an aqueous solution\n(Figure 4A).

When the ultrasound is\nswitched off the cell membrane repairs itself and the\ntransformed cell retains the plasmid DNA (Figure 4D).\nBacteria acquire new functions, such as growing on a\nselective medium, after taking up plasmid DNA\n(Figure 4E).\nTemperature affects UDD efficiency\nThe efficiency of UDD to P. putida UWC1at 228C was\nhigher than UDD efficiency at 0, 28 or 428C (Figure 5).\nHowever, the reason for this remains unclear. We\nmonitored the temperature of DNA transfer media\nduring 10 s ultrasound, and found that short-term ultra-\nsound treatment did not increase the temperature of cell\u2013\nplasmid reaction solutions (data not shown), which rules\nout the possibility that thermal effects associated with\nultrasound treatment affected UDD.\nThe effects of plasmid and cell concentration on UDD\nUDD efficiency was highest at plasmid concentrations\nof 0.8 ng\/ml with decreasing efficiency at lower and\nhigher values (Figure 6). Cell concentrations of\n6.0\u0002 0.9\u0001 107CFU\/ml or less did not give a significant\nnumber of transformants at a plasmid concentration of\n0.8 ng\/ml (Table 1). However, increasing concentration of\nplasmids up to 8 ng\/ml did generate a few transformants.\nSince UDD requires the interaction of cells and DNA,\nas cells concentration was low, the chance that plasmids\nmeet cells significantly decreased. This may suggest that\nthe number of collisions between cells and plasmids is\nimportant for UDD. Cell concentrations of 5.3\u0002 1.3\u0001 108\nand 3.2\u0002 0.3\u0001 109CFU\/ml gave UDD efficiencies of\n1.1\u0002 0.4\u0001 10\u00036 and 4.2\u0002 2.4\u0001 10\u00036 transformants per\n0.00E+00\n5.00E\u221207\n1.00E\u221206\n1.50E\u221206\n2.00E\u221206\n2.50E\u221206\n3.00E\u221206\n3.50E\u221206\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nPlasmid concentration (ng\/\u00b5l)\n \nP.\npu\ntid\na \nUW\nC1\nEf\nfic\nie\nnc\ny \nof\n u\nltr\nas\nou\nnd\n p\nla\nsm\nid\n tr\nan\nsf\ner\nFigure 6.

Using the optimal conditions based\non UDD experiments of P. putida UWC1, we have\nsuccessfully delivered pBBR1MCS2 to E. coli and\nP. fluorescens SBW25 with efficiencies of 1.16\u0002 0.13\u0001\n10\u00036 and 4.33\u0002 0.78\u0001 10\u00036 transformants per cell,\nrespectively (Figure 7A and B). To improve UDD\nefficiency of E. coli DH5a and P. fluorescens SBW25,\nmore work in the future is needed, since the optimal\nconditions for P. putida UWC1 may not necessarily be the\nbest for E. coli DH5a and P. fluorescens SBW25E.\nComparison of conjugation, electroporation and UDD of\nP. putidaUWC1\nUnder optimal conditions for P. putida UWC1: ultra-\nsound exposure time of 10 s, 50mM CaCl2, temperature of\n228C, plasmid concentration of 0.8 ng\/ml, P. putida UWC1\ncell concentration of 2.5\u0001 109CFU\/ml and reaction\nvolume of 500 ml, the efficiency of UDD was\n9.8\u0002 2.3\u0001 10\u00036 transformants per cell.
