Introduction  \nMunicipal waste landfills are large heterogeneous areas in which organic wastes undergo \ndegradation in anaerobic, acidic environments resulting in a high generation rate of landfill \ngas [1].  Emissions from municipal landfill sites can potentially be detrimental to both local \nand global air quality [2].  Landfill gas consists of up to 65% v\/v methane and 35% v\/v carbon \ndioxide, both of which are considered to be greenhouse gases contributing to global climate \nchange [2].  Trace volatile organic compounds represent less than 1% v\/v of landfill gas.  \nHowever these compounds are often odorous [3].  With increased levels of urbanisation and \nconsequent location of landfills in close proximity to highly populated areas, there has been \nan increasing level of intolerance to odour, which is now arguably the greatest nuisance \nassociated with landfill sites [3].  Consequently odour control has become an increasingly \nimportant aspect of regulation of landfills.  A reduction in odorous emissions is one of several \nobjectives associated with the use of daily cover material at landfill sites [4].  Conventionally, \nmaterial suitable for use as daily cover has been sourced from waste generated by the \nconstruction and demolition industry, however with a global decline of the industry, coupled \nwith the introduction of landfill tax, and increasing pressure to recycle and reuse resources, \nthe amount of suitable material for daily cover being sent to landfill is declining [5].  There is a \nneed to identity suitable alternatives to traditional daily cover materials.  Materials \ninvestigated to date include paper mill sludge, fly ash, mulched wood material and foams [3, \n6 to 8].  With the increasing drive towards sustainable waste management, use of a waste \nderived product such as compost, widely used in bio filters, appears favourable, and the \nability of compost to remove chlorinated hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds has been \npreviously reported [9]. \nInvestigating the capacity of alterative daily cover (ADC) materials to attenuate odorous \nemissions can be undertaken using olfactometry, or via the quantification of potentially \nodorous compounds using chemical analysis.  The latter provides quantitative on the \npresence of potentially odorous emissions.  In contrast, olfactometry provides information on \nthe odour threshold and thus potential sensory impact from the perception of the individual.  \nTherefore, ideally a combination of the two techniques would be required to assess the \nefficiency of a material to reduce the release of odorous compounds in to the atmosphere. \nThis study investigated the ability of compost to reduce both the sensory impact of \nthe odour concentration from the landfill gas and an understanding of the chemical \ncompounds and their reduction that can potentially contribute to that odour. \n \n2.  Materials and Methods \nTest Apparatus \nThe test apparatus comprised of an 800mm long, 120mm diameter, gas proof, acrylic \ncylinder, sealed at each end with acrylic plates and rubber seals (Fig. 1).  The effective \npacking height was 600mm, allowing entry and exit spaces of 100mm.  Six gas sampling \nports, with air tight valves, were located at 100mm intervals through out the packing height, \nallowing gas samples to be taken at different compost depths.  Air tight valves were also \nlocated at the gas inlet and outlet points.  The test material was supported on a perforated \nplastic plate. \n 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Test rig used to assess effectiveness of compost as a daily cover material for odour \nreduction \n \nDaily Cover Material \nMunicipal solid waste compost was used to represent daily cover material, however the \nexperimental methodology may be applied to other materials.   \nThree compost treatments were investigated as shown in Table 1.  The moisture content of \nthe compost as supplied was 35% w\/w.  To achieve a moisture content of 50% w\/w the \nappropriate volume was added.  Two compost densities were investigated to represent the \ncompaction likely to occur on site during the application process.  Compost was placed in the \ncolumn and compacted either by gently shaking to achieve a bulk density of 590 kg\/m3, or \nrammed in four layers by dropping a 3kg weight 50cm onto the compost surface to achieve a \nbulk density of 740 kg\/m3. \n \n100mm \nSample Ports800mm \nGas \noutlet \nGas \ninlet\nTable 1:  Compost and Gas treatments \nCompost Treatment Gas Treatment Treatment  \nNumber Density \n(kg\/m3) \nMoisture \nContent (%) \nLandfill Gas Standard Gas Ambient Air \n1 590 35 \u221a \u221a \u221a \n2 740 35 \u221a \u221a \u221a \n3 740 50  \u221a \u221a \n \nSample Gases \nThree sample gases were passed through the column in a series of experiments (Table 1).  \nTo test the robustness of the test column and sampling regime a certified standard gas (BOC \nGases, Manchester, UK) containing sulphurous compounds was used (Table 2). \n \nTable 2:  Certified standard gas supplied by BOC Gases (Manchester, UK) \nComponent Concentration \nDimethyl disulphide 0.25 ppm \nMethyl mercaptan 2.5 ppm \nHydrogen sulphide 70 ppm \nCarbon dioxide 35 % v\/v \nMethane Balance \n  \nExperiments using landfill gas were undertaken at a landfill site in Eastern England.  A single \ngas well, located in Stage 2 of the site was isolated from the main gas collection system. \nTo establish the background generated by the compost alone ambient air was passed \nthrough the column.  The emissions generated from the compost are shown in Table 3.  The \nheterogeneity of the compost material is indicated by the large standard deviations. \n \nOperating Conditions \nOnce the column had been filled with appropriate compost treatment, all sampling ports, \nexcept the inlet and outlet, were closed.  The column was operated in up-flow mode to \nsimulate the landfill surface emissions.  Gas flow rate through the column was measured and \nmaintained at 250ml\/min using a gas flow meter, providing an empty bed retention time \n(EBRT) of 36 min.  Time restrictions dictated a gas flow rate greater than surface emission \n 5 \nrates likely at landfill sites, and it was recognised that similar, previous studies has used a \nconsiderably lower flow rate of 10ml\/min [9, 10]. \nThe column was allowed to equilibrate and vent to the atmosphere for a one hour.  Gas \nsamples were taken from the inlet and outlet points of the column for olfactometry and \nTransportable Selective Ion Flow Tube (TSIFT) analysis.  Samples were also taken at \ndifferent compost depths (10, 30 and 50cm) for TSIFT analysis. \n \nTable 3: Emissions from compost when passing ambient air through a compost depth of \n60cm at 250ml\/min for 96 minutes.

Studies by \u0160pan\u011bl and Smith [12] have indicated the \nsuitability of the TSIFT technique for the detection and measurement of dimethyl sulphide \n(DMS), dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) and ethanethiol, with concentrations provided in parts \nper billion (ppb). \n3.  Results and Discussion \nOdour reduction \nOne of the objectives of daily cover material is to reduce odour emissions from the working \nsurface [4].  It is debated whether it is the newly deposited waste or rogue emissions of \nlandfill gas that cause the odours associated with landfill sites, though it is recognised that \nthe use of daily cover would be of an advantage when dealing with deposition of malodorous \nwastes [5]. \nTrials using landfill gas indicated a 69% reduction in the outlet odour concentration (OU\/m3) \nwhen compared with the inlet odour concentration 69% having passed through the column of \ncompost with a bulk density of 590kg\/m3, and a reduction of 97% when the bulk density of \nthe compost increased to 740kg\/m3, representing a significant (p \u2264 0.05) improvement in \nodour reduction with increased bulk density. \nTrials using the standard gas yielded a reduction in odour concentration ranging between \n97% and 99%, with no significant difference between treatments (Fig. 2). \nMean odour emission from the compost alone ranged between 78 and 1 510 OU\/m3, with an \naverage value of 709 OU\/m3.  No significant difference was found in the emissions from the \ndifferent treatments.  The large range of values may be a reflection of the heterogeneity of \nthe compost, with the additional error associated with olfactometry analysis of up to \u00b140% \n[13]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

Concentrations of DMS and ethanethiol were reduced by 38% \nv\/v, while concentrations of the DMDS, hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol were all reduced \nby more that 90% v\/v.  Increasing compost depth did not result in further significant reduction \nin compound concentration, with the exception of DMS and ethanethiol where concentrations \nwere reduced by a further 7% v\/v in the subsequent 20cm of compost. (Fig. 3). \nNo significant reduction in the concentration of any of the standard gas constituents was \nobserved when the compost bulk density was increased to 740kg\/m3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3.

Concentration reductions ranged from 28% for DMS and ethanethiol to \n100% for hydrogen sulphide.  When examining the depth profile for compound reduction, all \ngases showed a significant reduction in concentration after the first 10cm of compost.  \nReductions of 67% were observed for DMS and ethanethiol, 82% for DMDS and more than \n95% for hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol.

The first 10 cm of compost \nwas responsible for the most significant reduction in compound concentrations, removing \nbetween 63-100% v\/v of the original concentrations, with subsequent depth increments of \n10cm having no significant effect on the removal of the compounds.  Interestingly, significant \nincreases (p\u2264 0.05) in the levels of terpenes, DMS & ethanethiol and DMDS were found \nwhen comparing concentrations in compost at a depth of 50cm and the outlet samples.  \nConcentrations of ammonia did not differ significantly through the depth of the column. \nThe inconsistency of the results in the present study may be due a synergetic effect between \nadditional compounds present in landfill gas.  Odour and individual compound removal were \nboth accompanied by insignificant changes in moisture content and pH within the column for \nall gas and compost treatments suggesting minimal biological activity within the column. \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\nDimethyl sulphide +\nethanthiol\nDimethyl disulphide Hydrogen sulphide Methanethiol\nC\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \n(p\npb\n)\nIn 10 cm\n30 cm 50 cm\nOut\n1\n 9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5.

The analysis of odour \ncan be carried out either by olfactometry or chemical analysis.  In the present study the \nconcentrations of all the individual compounds analysed using the TSIFT, with the exception \nof ammonia, consistently exceeded the odour threshold values shown in Table 4.  An attempt \nwas made to identify any correlations between odour measurements and individual chemical \ncompound concentrations. \nNo significant correlation could be found between the concentration of individual compounds \nin the landfill gas and olfactometry results.  Previous studies have noted that there appeared \nto be a pronounced synergetic effect between compounds, as when considered individually, \nfew compounds produced a noticeably unpleasant odour, highlighting the difficulty in \npredicting emissions when several odours are combined [3]. \nThere were significant correlations (p\u2264 0.05) between the compound concentrations present \nin the standard gas with the exception of DMS. \nIn considering results from the ambient air samples, the inconsistent presence and low \nconcentration of low level of hydrogen sulphide may account for the insignificant correlation \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n5000\nTerpenes Dimethyl\nsulphide +\nethanthiol\nDimethyl\ndisulphide\nHydrogen\nsulphide\nAmmonia\nC\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \n(p\npb\n)\nIn\n10 cm\n30 cm\n50 cm\nOut\nbetween analytical and sensory measurement.  The high odour threshold of ammonia and \nmeasured concentrations not exceeding that threshold explains the absence of any \ncorrelation between TSIFT and olfactometry data in both the ambient air and landfill gas \nsamples. \n \nTable 4: Reported odour threshold ranges for the compounds analysed using TSIFT [14] \nCompound Reported Odour Threshold Ranges \n (mg\/m3) (ppb) \nTerpenes 0.0000018-0.0001  0.0003-0.0177 \nMethanethiol 0.000003-0.038 0.0015-19.0 \nEthanethiol 0.000043  0.0166 \nDimethyl sulphide 0.00034-0.0011 0.1316-0.4259 \nHydrogen sulphide 0.00076  0.536 \nDimethyl disulphide 0.0011-0.046  0.2809-11.75 \nAmmonia 0.1-11.6  140.67-1631 \n \nSeveral attempts have been made to relate odour concentrations with the concentrations of \nindividual odorants.  Hobbs et al. [15] were unable to find any correlation between \nolfactometry response and measurements of hydrogen sulphide when examining emissions \nfrom pig slurry.  In contrast, Noble et al. [16] found a close correlation between the combined \nconcentration of hydrogen sulphide and DMS and odour concentration for on-site emissions \nfrom mushroom compost, with the relationship unaffected by compost conditions, i.e. \nwhether it was aerated or unaerated, pre- or post-wetting.  The relationship was not as good \nwhen comparing hydrogen sulphide and DMS separately with odour measurements.  No \ncorrelation was found between ammonia and odour concentrations even though ammonia \nlevels exceeded odour threshold levels in 95% of the samples taken. \nThus the results from this and previous studies [1, 3, 15] appear to confirm that a definitive \nassessment of the sensory impact of odour can only truly be measured via olfactometry. \n \n4.  Conclusions \nThe suitability of the developed sampling technique for the testing of compost material was \nshown by good repeatability of results obtained by passing a standard gas through the test \ncolumn.  This sampling technique could therefore be applied to other cover materials, under \nvarying operating parameters to simulate different climatic conditions. \n 11 \nResults obtained by TSIFT analysis indicated the potential role of the technique in the study \nof landfill gas composition, while highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis \nsuite. \nField trials have shown that MSW compost has the ability to reduce odorous emissions from \nlandfill sites by up to 97%, with removal efficiency increasing with compost bulk density.  \nFrechen [17] estimated that the specific emission rates from an active depositing area \nranged between 4 000-30 000 OU\/m2\/h-1 and therefore based on the findings of this trial, \nemissions could be potentially reduced to 120-900 OU\/m2\/h-1 by the use of compost as a \ndaily cover material. \nField trials have also indicated the ability of MSW compost to reduce emissions of selected \nsulphurous compounds, with between 63-100% of the inlet concentration removed in the \ninitial 10cm of compost depth. Other studies support its ability to remove sulphur compounds \nand chlorinated hydrocarbons from landfill surface emissions [9].  Therefore the use of a \ncompost daily cover could potentially reduce the impact of emissions on the health of the \nsurrounding community, by reducing the release of individual compounds but by also \nreducing odour complaints, and thus facilitating better relations between the general public, \noperators and regulators. \nPoor correlation between individual compound and odour concentrations obtained from trials \nusing landfill gas, in comparison to those using standard gas, indicate the possibility of other \ncompounds present in landfill gas contributing to a synergetic effect to produce odorous \nemissions.  The potential synergy between compounds highlights the need for sensory \nmeasurement in the assessment of odorous emissions from landfill sites. \nReferences \n[1] Davoli, E., Gangai, M.L., Morselli, L., Tonelli, D.: Characterisation of odorants \nemissions from landfills by SPME and GC\/MS.
