In the joint statement that they gave at the end of the summit, they \ndeclared: \n \nWe envisage a unified Iraq with its territorial integrity respected. All the Iraqi \npeople \u2013 its rich mix of Sunni and Shiite, Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, \nChaldeans, and all others \u2013 should enjoy freedom, prosperity, and equality in a \nunited country. We will support the Iraqi people\u2018s aspirations for a representative \ngovernment that upholds human rights and the rule of law as cornerstones of \ndemocracy (Bush, Blair, Aznar, 2003) \n \nThe use of the term \u2017territorial integrity\u2018 is not isolated to this statement, but was repeatedly \ninvoked before the invasion and has been a constant refrain since. In February 2003 Bush had \ndeclared that the US would \u2017provide security against those who try to spread chaos, or settle \nscores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq\u2018 (Bush, 2003). General Tommy Franks\u2018 briefing \nto his commanders in August 2002 stated that \u2017the end state for this operation is regime change. \nSuccess is defined as regime leadership and power base destroyed; WMD capability destroyed or \ncontrolled; territorial integrity intact; ability to threaten neighbors eliminated; an acceptable \nprovisional\/permanent government in place\u2018 (quoted in Gordon and Trainor, 2006: 67). The \ndeclassified planning documents for the invasion (codenamed Polo Step), prepared by US \n 4 \nCentral Command (CentCom) planners for Franks in 2002, bear this out. In Phase IV of the \noperation, scheduled to begin after combat operations ceased, the following objectives to support \nthe establishment of a stable Iraqi government were set out: \n \n- Establish a secure environment and assist in recovery and reconstruction \n- Support the establishment of Iraqi Self-Defence forces \n- Ensure the territorial integrity of Iraq \n- Transition civil\/military activities to international organisations\/ non-\ngovernmental organisations\/ Iraqi Government (CentCom, 2002) \n \nDouglas Feith presented the \u2017US and Coalition Objectives\u2018 to Bush and the National Security \nCouncil on 4\nth\n March 2003, and of these the key objective was that \u2017Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity is \nmaintained and the quality of life in Iraq is improved visibly\u2018 (Woodward, 2004: 328). Blair\u2018s \nkey speech to the House of Commons on 18\nth\n March 2003 during the debate on the war, called \nfor a post-conflict UN resolution that would \u2017protect totally the territorial integrity of Iraq\u2018 \n(Blair, 2003; see Cater, 2003; Keohane, 2005). This term of \u2017territorial integrity\u2018 is the focus of \nthis article. How are we to understand this term, and how and why has it been so mobilised in the \ncontext of the Iraqi state? (see also Elden, 2005; Williams and Roach, 2006; El Ouali, 2006) \nIt would be instructive, in this general register, to broaden the inquiry beyond simply territorial \nintegrity to look at the question of territory itself. While crucial to the question of state power, \nterritory has received relatively little attention within political geography. By this we do not \nmean that there has not been extensive discussion of particular territorial arrangements, conflicts \nand settlements, but that the conceptual basis of the term has been under examined. While a \n 5 \nfuller discussion of the contemporary usage of this term, and its history are beyond the scope of \nthis essay, it is worth raising a few issues. Territory is traditionally understood as a bounded \nspace under the control or jurisdiction of a group of people, most commonly today a state. It is \noften blurred with understandings of territoriality \u2013 a strategy used by humans or groups of \nhumans to command or organise a space. Yet the historical and geographical specificity of the \nterm tends to be neglected in both of these literatures, and the basis for the crucial elements of \n\u2017space\u2018, \u2017boundedness\u2018 and control are neglected.1 \nIt is clear from the statements of Bush, Blair and others, made as troops were massing on the \nKuwaiti border and air strikes were being planned, that territorial integrity was understood to \nmean territorial preservation, by which we mean the maintenance of the existing borders and \nterritorial settlement of Iraq and the region more generally. This was being stressed in part \nbecause of the concerns of Iraq\u2018s neighbours, but also because of a wish to contain the impact of \nthe intervention, to simply effect regime change. There was a clear strategic need to reassure \nstates in the region that whatever actions were committed by the coalition in Iraq they would not \nsanction, nor were they in any way meant to facilitate, the breaking up of Iraq into smaller states. \nGiven the way in which ethnic and confessional identities do not straight-forwardly map onto \nterritorial division, it was clear that this could lead to an increase in ethnic and religious \ninstability throughout the region. Thus territorial integrity as territorial preservation was invoked \nspecifically to assure Iraq\u2018s neighbours that the coalition wanted to keep Iraq as a single state and \nto maintain stability within the wider region. In February 2004, nearly a year after the invasion, \nall of Iraq\u2018s neighbours \u2013 Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran \u2017declared their \nsupport for Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity\u2018 (McGoldrick, 2004: 174 n. 83). In interviews conducted \nduring the winter of 2006-07,\n2\n both the former Secretary of State for International Development, \n 6 \nClare Short and the former UK Ambassador to the UN, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who were closely \ninvolved in the discussions of the British government in the lead up to war, agreed that when \nIraq\u2018s territorial integrity was invoked in relation to Iraq that it was used only in connection with \nthe territorial preservation of the state but not its sovereignty. Greenstock insisted that these were \ntwo separate things; Short that it was interlinked to wider concerns, and that the usage of term \nhad to be understood in a wider context.\n3\n \nTo see territorial integrity simply as territorial preservation is a partial sense of the term. \nAlthough it has a longer heritage, extending back into the early twentieth century and efforts of \nthe international community to create and maintain a peaceable order, the key contemporary \nreference is the use of the term in the UN Charter (especially Article 2.4). There, as elsewhere, \nthe UN\u2018s invocation of the term \u2017territorial integrity\u2018 is partnered with a stress on sovereignty \nand political independence. One key instance of this was the crucial UN Security Council \nResolution (SCR) 1441 on \u2017the situation between Iraq and Kuwait\u2018 agreed on 8th November 2002 \n(for a discussion see Gordon and Shapiro, 2004: 112-3). With the situation becoming ever more \ntense in the region, this resolution sought to move towards an internationally agreed upon \nprogramme for the successful compliance of Iraq with existing resolutions concerning \ndisarmament. Crucially it reaffirmed \u2017the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Iraq, Kuwait and the neighbouring States\u2018 (UNSCR 1441). This was a \nkey issue, repeated verbatim in the \u2017second\u2018 resolution which the US and particularly the UK \ngovernment attempted, unsuccessfully, to get agreed by the UN (see Gordon and Shapiro, 2004: \n146-7; for the text see Sifry and Cerf, 2003: 499-500).\n4\n Territorial integrity, in its use within the \nUN Charter, requires both territorial preservation and territorial sovereignty. Recent work in \npolitical geography and international relations has sought to question the contemporary \n 7 \nutilisation of the term, in order to highlight the problems inherent in its partial invocation (see \nElden 2005, 2006; El Ouali, 2006; Williams and Roach, 2006). Many international lawyers \nwould agree that territorial integrity requires not simply the maintenance of existing territorial \nsettlements \u2013 what we here call \u2017territorial preservation\u2018 \u2013 but equally the ability of a state, \nwithin its boundaries, to have domestic jurisdiction without intervention or prevention from \noutside \u2013 the notion of \u2017territorial sovereignty\u2018 (see Akweenda, 1997; 1989; Zacher, 2001). \nIndeed, one of our interviewees stated that \u2017the whole issue is how you define territorial \nintegrity. Do you mean the unitary nature of the Iraqi state or do you mean the sovereignty of the \nIraqi state?\u20185 As Michael Byers argues, \u2017interpreted according to the 1969 Vienna Convention on \nthe Law of Treaties, the ordinary meaning of Article 2(4) is clear: the use of force across borders \nis categorically prohibited\u2018 (Byers, 2005: 15). Yet this was palpably not how the term was \nunderstood by the Bush-Blair coalition in early 2003. We see the Azores Summit statement and \nassociated pronouncements of the time as significant in showing how the US-led coalition \nrepeatedly invoked Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity in a specifically partial sense. The blindness to this \nmight be explained to some extent by Greenstock\u2018s suggestion that the meaning of territorial \nintegrity in UN resolutions and associated discussions had attained the status of a \u2017mantra\u2018, with \nthe meaning of the term little discussed within the Security Council. He suggested that its \ninclusion in resolutions was meant to reassure people that the UN was not trying to challenge the \nexisting tenets of international law that its resolutions were constructed upon.\n6\n  \nWhile the arguments about the relationship between sovereignty and territorial integrity seem to \nus to be worth further pursuing, and not simply in relation to Iraq, one thing seems clear. This is \nthat there has been a concerted argument in recent years against any absolute sense of territorial \nsovereignty, whether or not it is implied by territorial integrity. Greenstock, for instance, was \n 8 \nadamant that territorial integrity has no direct relation to sovereignty, yet he argued that the Iraqi \nstate in 2003 had lost any sense of legitimacy and therefore any right to the sovereign control of \nits territory. This contingency has been explicitly stated by numerous US officials, including \nStewart Patrick and Richard Haass of the State Department, and forms the basis of claims in the \nNational Security Strategy and other policy documents. This is the idea that \u2017sovereignty entails \nobligations\u2018. As the influential academic and government advisor Phillip Bobbitt has put it: \n \nThe United States has argued that because sovereignty arises from the people, \nstates that repudiate that popular basis \u2013 by denying democratic forms, or by \npracticing terror against their own populations \u2013 forfeit their claims of sovereignty \nand are therefore subject to lawful intervention by others. Both the Haitian and \nPanamanian interventions [and the NATO action in Yugoslavia over Kosovo] can \nbe legitimated on this basis. Yet the texts of the U.N. Charter, numerous treaties, \nand U.N. resolutions explicitly proclaim the territorial integrity of states and their \nright of independence without qualification (2003: 648, the phrase in brackets is \nfrom the note on that page). \n \nThus the legal basis of coalition claims is questionable, even if they make claims for legitimacy. \nThe celebration of Iraqi territorial integrity is, at the same time, its evisceration. This problem \nhas been accepted even by some of the advocates for war. As Richard Perle suggested, \n\u2017international law stood in the way of doing the right thing\u2018 (reported in Burkeman and Borger, \n2003; see Thornberry, 2005). Indeed, when told by the British Foreign Secretary that Foreign \nOffice lawyers had doubts about the legality of military action, the US Secretary of State replied \n 9 \nthat he should \u2017get new lawyers\u2018. Yet this was not Iraq, 2003 and Jack Straw and Colin Powell, \nbut Kosovo, 1999 and Robin Cook and Madeleine Albright (Albright, 2003: 384; see Mamdani, \n2005: 207). \nKosovo demonstrates an important point here, with even some of those that disagreed with the \nIraq war, such as Clare Short, agreeing with the general principle that sovereignty must have \nlimitations, with Kosovo as the key example. Yet it seems to us that this raises much more \ngeneral issues about the relation between ideas of humanitarian intervention\u2014as outlined, for \nexample, in the concept of the responsibility to protect (see International Commission on \nIntervention and State Sovereignty, 2001; United Nations, 2004)\u2014and notions of contingent \nsovereignty. This demonstrates one of the internal logics of the post-Cold War era that the \n\u2017global war on terror\u2018 has brought into stark focus. We have seen, on the one hand, the absolute \nnature of territorial preservation; yet on the other, the entirely contingent nature of territorial \nsovereignty. While the latter gave rise to justifications for intervention in Iraq for a range of \nreasons concerning supposed pursuit of weapons of mass destruction; its putative links to \nterrorist organisations; and the undeniable treatment of its civilian population, the former has led \nto maintenance of the existing territorial settlement being the essential framework within which \nall debates concerning the future of Iraq and its people have been held. Perhaps most \nsignificantly, this has led to any questions of territory being rendered extra-constitutional in the \nconstitutional negotiations.\n7\n \n It is upon this question of territory that this paper focuses. We wish to argue that it is precisely \nbecause territorial integrity was invoked in such a specifically partial fashion that Iraq\u2018s \nterritorial extent has been in question since the invasion of 2003. This is not to say that there \nwere no challenges before, but rather to stress that the strategy of seeking to minimise them has, \n 10 \nsomewhat paradoxically, meant that they have never been fully removed. This extends through \nthe increased factionalism, which some have described as a \u2017civil war\u2018, and the destabilising \neffects this is having on the wider region. What we wish to raise by this is a third meaning that \nterritorial integrity implies, albeit more informally. This can especially be seen in terms of \ndebates about the final status of the Palestinian territories and Kosovo. This is that territorial \nintegrity also has a sense of viability. In other words, is Iraq as it currently exists sustainable? \nWould sub-state or secessionist regions be realistic self-contained sovereign units?  \nIn order to answer these questions in this paper we consider a number of issues analysing several \nelite accounts of the invasion and its aftermath, interviews with selected \u2017experts\u2018, and numerous \ngovernment speeches and official documents. This provides us with significant primary and \nsecondary data with which to consider the extent to which Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity has been \ninvoked and violated during the period from 2003-2007, and the effect that those actions may \nhave on the future viability of the Iraqi state.  \n \nA History of Iraq\u2019s Territorial Integrity \nThe complicated historical geographies of the Iraqi state have been carefully examined in a range \nof studies, and so need not detain us here (see for example The Geographer, 1964, 1970; Sluglett, \n1976; Tripp, 2007). The key issue is the role they play in determining the contemporary \ngeographies of the Iraqi state. Dodge, for instance, contends that many of Iraq\u2018s present \nproblems can be traced back to the period of the British Mandate and concerns surrounding the \nsettlement of Iraq\u2018s boundaries.8 He argues that the mandate ideal was poorly suited to the region \nthat became Iraq, with its strong tribal traditions and lack of experience of, or desire for, state \ninstitutions (Dodge, 2003). In addition, these tribal affiliations were, especially in the north, cut \n 11 \nacross by the new international border. Thus, when Iraq gained full independence in 1932 a \nnumber of festering problems already existed, including the division of the Kurdish population \nbetween Iraq and Turkey.  \n \nMAP HERE \n \nThroughout Iraq\u2018s history attempts have been made to keep the country together, both through \nforce of arms and force of law. Iraq\u2018s various constitutions, for instance, have repeatedly stressed \nthe inviolability of its territorial settlement, invoking its own territorial integrity. The 1990 \nConstitution, for example, states in Article 3 that \u2017the sovereignty of Iraq is an indivisible entity\u2018, \nand that \u2017the territory of Iraq is an indivisible entity of which no part can be ceded\u2018. The \nimportance of the territorial preservation of the state is underlined with its specific prohibition of \nsecession. This is unsurprising given that, especially in the north, strong attachments to the tribal \nand ethnic distinctions of the three Ottoman vilayets (Mosul in the north and Basra in the south \nwith Baghdad between) had been a continual issue for Iraqi governments. The issue of the \nviability of the Iraqi state has been a continuous undercurrent which, as we will discuss later, has \nre-emerged in recent years. \nThis is particularly the case in terms of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Many Kurds argue \nthat this region is a part of a greater Kurdistan, comprising Kurdish populations in neighbouring \nIran, Turkey and Syria and that the boundary delimitation treaties of the 1920s artificially \ndivided the Kurdish homelands. Since 1991 the Kurdish region in Iraq has been operating under \nde facto autonomy (see Stansfield, 2003a, 2003b). Following the defeat of Iraq in the 1991 Gulf \nWar, Saddam forcibly put down uprisings in the north and south of the country. A huge \n 12 \nmovement of Iraq Kurds toward the Turkish border, attempting to escape the Ba'athist regime, \nled to Turkey formally closing its border with Iraq leaving thousands stranded in the \nmountainous border country inside northern Iraq (Laizer, 1996). The UNSC responded by \npassing resolution 688 on 3\nrd\n April 1991, in which it called on Iraq to allow immediate access to \nthese people by international humanitarian organisations. The US and UK governments used this \nas a basis for establishing and policing no-fly zones in the north and south of the country (see \nWilliams 2007).  \nSome commentators, such as Ahmed (2003: 194-7) have challenged the claim that the no-fly \nzones served a humanitarian purpose, on the somewhat tendentious grounds that the people were \npersecuted elsewhere and that a more genuine desire to protect the civilian population would \nhave been a more widespread measure. Ahmed also notes that the Turks were able to cross into \nthe north in their war with the PKK, and that the protection in the south prevented little due to \nmost of the persecution being through artillery or army. His claim is that these had more to do \nwith strategic interests. The impact of the sanctions regime undoubtedly caused many Iraqi \ndeaths, and it is often forgotten that the \u2017policing\u2018 of the no-fly zones caused causalities itself. \nOne other aspect that is worth noting is that these measures had absolutely no basis in UNSC \nresolutions. John Pilger notes an interview with the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali \nwho stated with regard to the framing of resolution 688 that \u2017the issue of no-fly zones was not \nraised and therefore not debated: not a word\u2026 they offer no legitimacy to countries sending their \naircraft to attack Iraq\u2018 (Pilger, 2002; see Fisk, 2006: 885). Yet this resolution unquestionably \nstressed the commitment of the UN to respecting the \u2017sovereignty, territorial integrity and \npolitical independence\u2018 of Iraq.  \n 13 \nMuch has been written on the efficacy and ethics of these zones (see McKelvey, 1997; Tart, \n2001; Yamashita, 2004; Benard, 2004). In terms of Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity they clearly \ninhibited the ability of the Iraqi government to exercise its sovereign powers across the full \nextent of its territory. This points towards understanding Iraq\u2018s sovereignty, and therefore its \nterritorial integrity more widely, as being contingent: dependent on its actions and policed by the \nUS and UK.  \nThis compromised sovereignty was further eroded in 1998 when the allies launched Operation \nDesert Fox. This operation, which involved the US launching a number of cruise missile and \nbombing attacks upon sites within Iraq, was carried out as a result of Iraq\u2018s perceived failure to \nadhere to the requirements of UN Security Council Resolutions and to comply with the UN \nweapons inspectors. With its stated remit to uphold UN directives, this attack met with relatively \nlittle resistance from the international community, though this clearly reinforced the continued \nerosion of Iraq\u2018s territorial sovereignty. \nThus while these resolutions did not de jure dismember Iraq, they profoundly limited the ability \nof Iraq to exercise its sovereignty across its entire territorial extent.\n9\n This is both in terms of the \nlimits on its projection of military power within its own boundaries \u2013 what Liberal Democrat \nForeign Affairs spokesman Michael Moore raised in terms of the vertical dimension of territorial \nintegrity\n10\n \u2013 but also in terms of the humanitarian agencies which were able to exercise the \nsovereign power over the lives of the inhabitants (see Duffield 2007). The governance of life \nitself thus moved from Iraq to these agencies, and in this, along with other registers Iraq\u2018s \nterritorial sovereignty was compromised. De facto, its territorial preservation was also affected. \nWith the inability of Saddam\u2018s forces to exercise power, the Kurdish region in northern Iraq \nfunctioned, during the 1990s, as effectively autonomous, under the control of the democratically \n 14 \nelected Kurdish Regional Government (Natali, 2005: 64). However, two rival factions - the PUK \nand the KDP- ensured that this self-rule was not ever fully delivered. In 1994 civil war broke out \nbetween these two parties and the region was effectively divided into two sections, each under \nthe control of one faction (Stansfield 2003b). This division continued throughout the 1990s, and \nthe region's autonomy was further eroded by the invitation in of Iraqi forces to quell some of the \ncivil conflict. \n \nPolitical Process and Constitution \nAs well as being a frame within which the invasion of Iraq was conceived, the invocation of \nterritorial integrity also functioned to contain the occupation and reconstitution of the state \nwithin established boundaries, directly linking the sovereignty of Iraq to a preconceived \ngeographical entity. Indeed, as Anderson and Stansfield point out succinctly, \u2017Iraq has \nmaintained its territorial integrity as a state. What it has never succeeded in becoming is a nation\u2018 \n(2004: 6).  The \u2017state\u2018 in this instance implies the legal basis, while the \u2017nation\u2018 suggests a less \nrigid sense of a shared community. Yet these notions are not necessarily entirely in tension. The \nIraqi Ambassador to the UK, Dr Salah al Shaikly, highlighted this phenomenon when he noted \nthat the Iraqi National Accord, of which he was a member when it planned for the future of Iraq \nafter the overthrow of Saddam, had also focused upon the preservation of the territorial state of \nIraq, rather than addressing or opening up the national identities of its constituent population. He \ncommented that: \u2017At no time in fact, at no time, then or now or ever, [had we] ever thought that \nIraq would be more than one country\u2018.11  On the one hand this stops short of a project of nation-\nbuilding, yet on the other it demonstrates that elite Iraqis did consider their country to be a \nsingle, unified, geographically fixed, state. Thus, for the Iraqi opposition it was a case of \n 15 \nreplacing the existing regime with a new one, within a given, largely unproblematised, territorial \nframe.  \nThe nature of that change (driven by Iraqis) would have given a strength to its claims for \nlegitimacy; something that the coalition was unwilling to immediately entertain. In May 2003 the \nUK and US Ambassadors to the UN published a joint statement in which they described the way \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority would operate as the sovereign power:  \n \nThe United States, the United Kingdom and Coalition partners working through \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority shall, inter alia, provide for security in and the \nprovisional administration of Iraq. Including by: deterring hostilities; maintaining \nthe territorial integrity of Iraq and securing Iraq\u2018s borders (Greenstock & \nNegroponte, 2003; see Chesterman, 2004: 93). \n \nWhat is telling about this programme is the way that it explicitly puts security first, seeing the \nadministration of the state as subsequent to it. Many would agree with this ordering, although it \nwas obviously much less effective in practice. Yet one of the reasons why security has been so \ndifficult to obtain may be precisely because of this obsession with a particular framing. As \nO\u2018Leary and Salih comment, \u2017the CPA was fixated on its public international commitment to the \nterritorial integrity of Iraq which pushed it toward favouring a recentralised Iraq\u2018 despite the \nparticular opposition of the Kurds (2005: 32). This focus can be further evidenced on the CPA\u2018s \nown record of its achievements. In setting out what it saw as the main objectives of Iraq\u2018s new \nforeign policy they stated that it must be to \u2017protect Iraq\u2018s security, stabilise the country and \npreserve Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity\u2018 (CPA, 2004: 46) \n 16 \nJust as with the invasion plans, it is clear that territorial integrity here is understood as territorial \npreservation. It must be so, since sovereignty over Iraq was held, at least temporarily, by an \noccupying force. Greenstock, who held a role in the CPA as British Special Representative, \nconceded that the coalition occupation was \u2017in effect a suspension of [Iraq\u2018s] sovereignty\u2018, but \nargued that this \u2017didn\u2018t affect the territorial integrity\u2018 because while it \u2017affected the sovereignty \nof [the] government\u2026 it didn\u2018t affect the sovereignty of the state and its people\u201812 On these \nterms sovereignty was held in abeyance, ready to be returned when a suitable Iraqi \nadministration could be put in place. \nThe peculiar performance of sovereignty that entailed the handover of power from the CPA to \nthe transitional government has been discussed elsewhere, so we will focus here only on the \nterritorial aspects. This stress on territorial preservation can be clearly illustrated through \nreference to the new Iraqi constitution. There is a clear tension inherent in this document. On the \none hand it sought to play off competing demands along ethnic divisions, as power given in one \ndirection had to be balanced with compromises in another; on the other it continually stressed the \nshared nature of the struggles and future challenges for an Iraqi state it was in the process of \nconstituting and reconstituting. Article 65, for example, states that the President shall be seen as \n\u2017the symbol of the nation\u2018s unity and represents the sovereignty of the country\u2018. They are further \ncharged with guaranteeing adherence to the constitution as well as \u2017the preservation of Iraq\u2018s \nindependence and unity and the security of its territory, in accordance to the law\u2018. Further, \nArticle 107 states that the role of the central federal authority will be to \u2017maintain the unity of \nIraq, its integrity, independence, sovereignty and its democratic system\u2018 (Iraq Constitution, \n2005).  \n 17 \nAt the same time however, the new Iraqi constitution itself creates a number of difficulties \nconcerning the future territorial integrity of Iraq. This occurs most obviously with regard to the \nwrangling over the form that the Iraqi state should take, the extent to which it is federated or \ndecentralised, and the place of the different groupings within the organs of the state. The \nconstitution provides a great deal of latitude in terms of the potential decentralisation of the state. \nArticle 113 clearly states that Iraq shall be a federal state \u2017made up of the capital, regions, \ndecentralised provinces, and local administrations\u2018. Yet the continued deferring of the most \ndifficult decisions concerning the federal nature of the new state threatens to challenge this. By \ndevolving substantial powers to the regions, especially the Kurdish north, the constitution strikes \nan uneasy balance between attempting to maintain Iraq as a territorial whole, whilst aiming to \ngive enough power to the regions to prevent secession. Thus the Iraqi constitution is still viewed \nas a document in transition, not yet a finished product. While leaving room for manoeuvre is an \nunderstandable tactic, this goes beyond this. Most crucially it means that the key questions of \nwhat Iraq is, both in terms of its people and its territorial extent, remain open. The Constitution \nof Iraq fails to address the very real question of the constitution of\u2014that is the elements which \nmake up\u2014Iraq. As Ambassador al Shaikly noted, it is impossible to write a constitution quickly, \nas it needs reflection, and it \u2017has to come out of the experience of the nation\u2018. He suggested that \nthe environment was not right, as \u2017it was very enflamed and violent when the constitution was \nwritten\u2018.13 Despite it being voted for, many believe it needs to be looked at again.14 \nIn terms of the international community there have been similar issues. Rather than the earlier \ninvocation of the \u2017sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2018 of Iraq, UNSCR 1546, passed on 8th June \n2004, stressed the \u2017independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Iraq\u2018, noting the \nframework of the international system that post-2003 Iraq must operate within. Thus sovereignty \n 18 \nis reinforced with independence, and territorial integrity linked to the idea of unity. These types \nof pronouncements serve again to centre the notion of territorial integrity, at once \nunproblematically and yet equally to stress tacitly the way in which it has been understood, and \nviolated.  \n \nViability \nImmediately after the 1991 Gulf War, a White House policy paper declared that \u2017in no way \nshould we associate ourselves with the 60-year-old rebellion in Iraq or oppose Iraq\u2018s legitimate \nattempts to suppress it\u2018 (quoted in Kaplan and Kristol, 2003: 41, emphasis added). We find here \nan interesting stress on the territorial sovereignty of Iraq, that matters of internal concern are for \nIraq alone. The justification for this war had been the invasion of Kuwait, legally coded as Iraq\u2018s \nviolation of Kuwait\u2018s territorial sovereignty, and the limits of intervention had been to redress \nthat wrong, rather than to overthrow the Saddam regime. Although this had been with UN \nauthorisation, the first President Bush\u2018s National Security Advisor has claimed this was not \nessential. \n \nWhile we had sought United Nations support from the outset of the crisis, it had \nbeen as part of our efforts to forge an international consensus, not because we \nthought we required its mandate. The UN provided an added cloak of political \ncover. Never did we think that without its blessing we could not or would not \nintervene (Scowcroft in Bush and Scowcroft, 1998: 416). \n \n 19 \nColin Powell, who had served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the 1991 war, similarly \njustified the way in which the military action did not continue to Baghdad, suggesting that \u2017it \nwould not contribute to the stability we want in the Middle East to have Iraq fragmented into \nseparate Sunni, Shia, and Kurd political entities\u2018 (Powell, 1995: 512). The reasons behind this \nare clearly outlined by McQueen: \n \nAlthough the US would have liked to see Saddam Hussein removed from power, \nperhaps through a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, it did not intend the disintegration of Iraq \nfor a number of reasons. It believed that the \u2017Lebanonisation of Iraq\u2018 would \n\u2017create a geopolitical nightmare\u2018 that might significantly destabilise the balance of \npower in the region. The US feared the rising influence of Iranian fundamentalism \nin the Middle East, as did its allies Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which were more \nconcerned about Shi\u2018ite domination of Iraq than about the continuation of a \nweakened Ba\u2018athist regime. In addition, the US feared that the disintegration of \nIraq into its ethnically homogenous parts might risk a power vacuum that would \nlead to instability and recurrent warfare in the region (2005: 31). \n \nA number of these concerns clearly relate to the situation the US, UK, and Iraq have found \nthemselves since 2003. Indeed, as Galbraith notes,  \n \nironically, it was Bush [Senior\u2018s] failure to help the uprising that produced the \nbreakup of Iraq. The Kurds created their de facto independent state when the \npresident was forced to establish the safe haven for them. America\u2018s indifference \n 20 \nto the slaughter of Iraq\u2018s Shiites drove them into the embrace of Iran\u2018 (Galbraith, \n2006: 60)  \n \nYet during the Clinton years, the long running problems and the regrets of some who had \npreviously advocated caution, as well as the increasingly influence of those who had wanted to \noverthrow Saddam then, led to a sustained call for a resolution of the situation. By the time \nGeorge W. Bush was elected, and especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11\nth\n 2001, \nthere was great momentum behind calls for intervention. What is interesting is that reasons \npreviously given about instability were no longer sufficient of a present danger to mitigate \nagainst intervention. In 2003 the neoconservatives Kaplan and Kristol, for example, declared that \n \nWe have long ago passed the threshold where the prospect of, say, a fragmented \nIraq is a greater evil than the persistence of Saddam Hussein. That things might be \nworse without him is of course a possibility. But given the status quo in Iraq, it is \ndifficult to imagine how (2003: 96).  \n \nFive years later, it is unfortunately all too obvious. Despite a number of events which have been \nhailed as important milestones \u2013 the end of \u2017major combat operations\u2018 (1st May 2003); the \ntransfer of sovereignty from Bremer to unelected Iraqi officials (28\nth\n June 2004); the acceptance \nof the constitution in a referendum (15\nth\n October 2005) and various elections \u2013 increased and \nsustained violence, ethnic divisions and political gridlock rendered this state almost untenable as \na viable political entity. Yet there would be very real problems for any sub-state entity seeking to \n 21 \nbreak away from Iraq. These include issues concerning the contiguity of territory within a state \nand its ability to function self-sufficiently.  \nSeveral issues, such as passage to the outside world, access to resources, the free movement of \npeople and goods and control of airspace and territorial waters are crucial to full sovereignty. \nThe continuing issues facing Palestine and Israel, and the viability of a two-state solution there, \nillustrate this point succinctly (see Farsakh, 2001). With specific relation to Iraq, questions of \nethnic divisions, access to the sea, oil reserves, fertile land and the location of marshes, \nmountains and deserts all raise a number of complications. For instance, Iraq\u2018s vast deposits of \noil are located in two relatively small geographic areas within the state. Therefore, it is \nunsurprising that some Iraqis are opposed to any fragmentation of Iraq, seeing this as a potential \nfor dispossession, whilst others living within these resource-rich regions are less concerned about \nIraq\u2018s future construction, and indeed at times are expressly pushing for its breakup. Such \nstrategic considerations help to explain some of the tactics of those holding positions of power \nwithin post-2003 governments. \nArguments about these sorts of problems are not new. In 2004 Michael Knights of The \nWashington Institute suggested that \n \nCurrent trends suggest that it will be governed by a very strong form of \nfederalism, with central government playing a minimal role. With the traditional \ncentral government role of security devolved to the regions, Iraq\u2018s oil revenues \ncould become the only real element of the Iraqi state holding the nation together \u2013 \nthe only feature with sufficient gravity to stop the centrifugal forces of \nsectarianism from pulling the country apart (2004: 238). \n 22 \n \nOthers have worried about the possibilities that this might produce. As a Professor of Strategic \nStudies at the U.S. Naval War College has noted, reporting the views of a Kurd interlocutor, \u2017the \nUS will fight for the last seat on the last helicopter; the Kurds will go up into the mountains and \n\u2015those who remain behind to fight over the rotting carcass of the Iraqi state will be the survivors \nof a process of political Darwinism\u2016\u2018 (Hashim, 2006: 361). In his study of the insurgency in the \ncountry, Hashim suggests two alternatives of a soft partition of confederation \u2017with ironclad \nagreements on territorial boundaries and resource-sharing\u2018, or a \u2017\u2015hard partition\u2016, which splits \nthe country into distinct and independent entities\u2018. He goes on to suggest that \u2017the mere mention \nof partition is viewed with distaste by the international community, genuine horror regionally, \nand wide variety of responses by Iraqis\u2018. His conclusion is that \u2017it would be best if the Iraqis \nwere to walk back from the abyss and find a way to coexist\u2018 (Hashim, 2006: 360). While this \nmay be true in terms of the impact the current situation is having, very real questions need to be \nasked about whether this is in the genuine long term interest of the people. \nIn 2006, then British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett was asked what sort of Iraq Britain \nwould leave, she replied: \u2017one that was democratic, which could \u2015cope\u2016 and that was \u2015back on its \nfeet\u2016\u2018. She was further questioned about whether she thought Iraq was sustainable or might \nfragment. Her reply was instructive: \u2017Everyone has been very keen to keep everyone together but \nin the longer term... it is not for us to say \u2017you will do this or you will do that\u2018.\u2018 Her interviewer \nthen asked if it would be a disaster to have this fragmented state: \u2017If that is what they want and \nthey feel it is workable that is another matter\u2018 (BBC News 2006a). It is of course difficult to \nargue with the claim that it is for the Iraqi people to decide.\n15\n However two key points need to be \nmade to nuance this argument: one is the question of who the Iraqi people are. Does it is include \n 23 \nthose currently present within the legal boundaries of the country, or those who are currently \nliving elsewhere? Where do those who lived in exile during the Saddam regime, those who \nformed the Iraqi National Accord and other key voices of dissent, fit into this picture? What \nabout those who have begun to return to Iraq since the overthrow of the former regime? This is \nparticularly important when the question of regions or key cities are discussed. Kirkuk, for \ninstance, witnessed significant population changes as a result of Ba\u2018athist policies, so any \nplebiscite on its future regional affiliation is necessarily problematic. It would be problematic \nboth in terms of political viability but also, and potentially more importantly, by reducing a \npolitical problem to a question of a technocratic, calculative solution. The continuation of census \npractices also invokes another register in which, as Derek Gregory has put it (2004), we live in \nthe \u2017colonial present\u2018. Another key issue is how the insistence on Iraqi choice fits with the deeply \ncompromised sovereignty of the existing government, constitution and population, all the time \nthe country continues to be occupied by US and UK forces? \n \nFactionalism in Iraq  \nOne of the issues that is often under examined is how the continual attempt to balance the \ncompeting interests of \u2017Kurds, Shi\u2018as and Sunnis\u2018 has not brought them closer together as Iraqis, \nbut rather helped to cement them as discrete identities. This was a point made many times by our \ninterviewees. In his book on the Bosnian conflict, Campbell, following Derrida, utilises the \nnotion of ontopology, linking \u2017territorial representation, population identification, and historical \ndetermination\u2018 to examine the roots and outcomes of the collapse of Yugoslavia (1998: 80). \nAdopting this approach gives a powerful lens with which to analyse the impact of invocations \nand violations of territorial integrity in the current factionalism within Iraq because it allows us \n 24 \nto consider the extent to which these problems are rooted in historically-grounded divisions that \nlink Iraqi notions of \u2017home\u2018 to either a specific ethnic or religious group, or to a bounded \nterritorial entity (see Bulley, 2006). These notions have become increasingly important since the \n2003 invasion, not only as a rallying point against the US-led coalition, but also as self-\nidentifiers utilised to heighten the significance of the different minorities, and the differences \nbetween them. \nThe militant factionalism within Iraq has all too often seen as the basis for the descent into what \nthe former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and former Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi have \nboth called a \u2017civil war\u2018 (see BBC News, 2006b; Cockburn, 2006: 208).16 The emergence of \ngroups such as the Mehdi Army, and the growth in obviously sectarian-motivated attacks in Iraq, \nclearly have ethnic and religious bases. Yet rendering them as purely ethnic conflicts fails to \nilluminate the complex nature of the post-2003 situation and does nothing to generate an \nunderstanding of its origins. The Western media has been all too happy to paint this infighting as \nsymptomatic of a country dogged by divisions that can be traced back to its inception as a state \n(see Packer, 2006: 336). However, this over-simplification overlooks the composition of pre-\n2003 Iraq and fails to analyse how events since then have shaped and embedded new \nfactionalisms across the country. Indeed, Ambassador Al Shaikly suggested that under Saddam \nthere was a strong sense of an Iraqi identity: \n \nWe have never quarrelled among ourselves since the British put together modern-\nday Iraq in the \u201820s. Iraqis didn\u2018t quarrel among themselves. In other words, \nArabs didn\u2018t fight Kurds; Shi\u2018a didn\u2018t fight Sunnis. Our quarrel was not lateral, \nour quarrel was vertical in a sense. We quarrelled with our government all the \n 25 \ntime. We accused them of being dictators, we accused them of not giving us \nsufficient freedom. But we haven\u2018t quarrelled with each other.17 \n \nAs Packer similarly suggests, \u2017the decades of living together wove innumerable personal ties and \ncreated a national consciousness that was badly damaged by Saddam, especially among the \nyoung, but was nonetheless real\u2018 (Packer, 2006: 337). Yet, of course, as al Shaikly himself \nadmitted, the situation is different today. It is too simplistic to argue that the presence of coalition \nforces in Iraq and the overthrow of the Saddam regime are completely to blame for this emergent \nfactionalism, yet the handling of the reconstruction and occupation has undoubtedly played a \nmajor role.\n18\n As Packer continues, \u2017there was nothing inevitable about Iraq\u2018s falling apart. If it \nfell apart, it would do so because of the folly of its leaders\u2018 (Packer, 2006: 337). The violence in \nthe country is not confined to one of the stated groups, and some of the worst Iraqi-on-Iraqi \nviolence has come from the Shi\u2018a community that, according to received wisdom, has benefited \nmost from the removal of the pro-Sunni Saddam regime. Instead we need to consider the extent \nto which the rise in factionalism was itself produced through the attempts to operate within a \nfixed sense of the territorial extent and the population composition of the country. \nAs al Shaikly\u2018s comments above suggest, the history of Iraq is not, as many would suggest, \nstraight-forwardly shot through with inter-ethnic animosities. To be sure, as in all multi-ethnic \nand multi-religious states, a degree of tension has been present but political movements within \nIraq have often tended to focus more explicitly upon the removal of the incumbent regime rather \nthan changing its ethnic composition. The question, therefore, arises as to what has happened in \nIraq to change this vertical quarrel into a lateral one.  \n 26 \nTo consider post-2003 factionalism in Iraq as simply a conflict between Shi\u2018a, Sunni, and Kurd, \nis to grossly simplify a complex situation. Inevitably though, as the Shi\u2018a, Sunni, and Kurd are \nthe three most populous groupings it is the actions from within these groups that receive the most \ncoverage. Second, these are not discreet groups. As well as intermarriage which inevitably \ncomplicates straightforward division \u2013 al Shaikly claimed that \u201750% of the Iraqi population are \nof mixed nationality\u201819 \u2013 the majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Third, popular conceptions of \nIraq commonly suggest that these three groupings are based in discreet geographical localities \nwhilst in reality this is only significantly true for the Kurds.\n20\n  \nAs noted above, the Kurdish population within Iraq is concentrated in the north of the country, \nalthough there are significant elements of other population groups in this area. Yet events have \nconspired to keep the Kurds concentrated within this geographical area, and their relationship to \nthe Iraqi state was altered inexorably by the imposition, by the US and UK, of the northern no-\nfly zone after the 1991 Gulf War, which effectively limited Iraq\u2018s ability to enforce and maintain \nits territorial integrity and allowed the Kurds to operate de facto autonomy over the region. Since \n2003, however, the Kurdish situation has become increasingly complex with prominent Kurds \nexplicitly advocating Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity through their participation in the CPA and the \nnew Iraqi government. Indeed the current President of Iraq is Jalal Talabani, former leader of one \nof the Kurdish factions, whilst his bitter enemy during the 1990s, Massoud Barzani, presently \nholds the position of President of the Kurdish autonomous government. Both these men have \nstated that they do not wish to see Iraq split into its original three provinces, but instead favour \nthe development of a federal Iraq (BBC News, 2005a; BBC News, 2005b). In terms of calls for \nfull Kurdish independence this is a step backwards. It remains unclear, however, whether these \nare their true strategies, or that they are merely tactically sensible actions given the current \n 27 \nclimate and in particular the US occupation. However, as Bremer notes, in the early stages of the \npost-Saddam period Talabani commented that \u2017you are asking us to join an Iraq in which we\u2018ll \nhave less freedom that we had while Saddam was in power\u2018 (2006: 297, emphasis added). \nIndeed, as Packer notes, \u2017a generation of Kurds grew up speaking no Arabic and feeling no \nconnection to Iraq, and the idea of rejoining a country that not long ago visited genocide and \nethnic cleansing on Kurds was a hard sell\u2018 (2006: 362).  \nThese comments reinforce a perception that Iraqi Kurdistan is territorially and culturally separate \nfrom the rest of Iraq, and that its potential bond with Kurds in neighbouring countries is greater \nthan its attachment to the rest of Iraq. However, whether Kurds want independence is not clear \ncut. Oxford Research International polls, in 2005, found that only 12% of Kurds polled were in \nfavour of Iraq being broken up into separate states (see Dodge, 2005: 55). Yet during the January \n2005 elections there were unofficial \u2017referendum booths just outside, or actually inside, every \npolling place. Two million Kurds voted in the referendum and 98 percent chose independence\u2018 \n(Galbraith, 2006: 171). In addition, while there is little argument that the Kurdish population \nwithin Iraq does have a distinct territorial extent, and has experience of controlling its own \nsovereign functions that would allow the creation of a separate state, such geographical readings \nof the other factional disputes within Iraq are less clear cut.  \nMuch of the post-2003 coverage of the rise of factionalism in Iraq has centred upon the supposed \nconflict between the Shi\u2018a and Sunni Arabs, and of the Sunni \u2017insurgency\u2018 against the coalition \n(on the occupation and insurgency see McCarthy, 2006; Napoleoni, 2005). Much of this has \nfocused upon the perceived geographical heart of the rebellion against the coalition and the new \ngovernment \u2013 the \u2017Sunni Triangle\u2018. This region, which has Baghdad at its eastern corner, and \nRamadi to the west and Tikrit to the north, has been consistently held up as the seat of the \n 28 \ninsurgency\n21\n, but as Packer comments this term is seen by many within Iraq as an \u2017insult \u2013 that \nthe term was an American invention\u2018 (2006: 335-6). A particular geographical imaginary is at \nplay here, suggesting that specific areas, and sites within them \u2013 Fallujah being the most obvious \nexample \u2013 can be targeted as part of the process of securitising Iraq. \nIn his study of Bosnia Campbell talks about the ways in which \u2017questions of history\u2018 can be \n\u2017violently deployed in the present for contemporary political goals\u2018 (1998: 86). This has certainly \nbeen seen in terms of Iraq\u2018s present. The coalition\u2018s invocation of Iraq\u2018s territorial integrity as \npreservation, and in particular the strategy of bargaining with the perceived key ethnic \ngroupings, actually helped bring the artificial nature of the Iraqi state to the fore. Rather crudely \nit suggested that Iraq was composed of three largely homogenous groups the Shi\u2018a, Sunni, and \nKurd, who populated almost exclusively three distinct geographical regions, mapping on to the \noriginal Ottoman vilayets of Baghdad, Basra, and Mosul. The strength of a defined Iraqi \nKurdistan and the emergence of more notional entities, such as the Sunni triangle, play into these \narguments, as the geographies of the pre-Iraqi populations within the Ottoman Empire are \nunproblematically mapped onto today\u2018s factionalism. This is yet another partial invocation, a \npartial understanding of Iraq\u2018s current problems and the crises they create for its continued \nterritorial viability.  \nAt the heart of sovereignty is the ability to secure the state, protect the population and to enforce \nsecurity within its borders. While many states are not able to achieve this, it is the inherent myth \nthat founds the international system; what Greenstock described as \u2017an important structural \nfiction\u2018.22 The failings of the CPA and the legacies of the occupation are, of course, multiple, but \nthe lack of an accountable sovereign and the failure to provide security and basic services \nundoubtedly led to a breakdown in trust. For some, this is productive of division rather than a \n 29 \nconsequence of it. Greenstock admitted failures of the CPA, and talked at length about the ways \nin which security and identity are linked \n \nYou can take risks in sharing territory and life and towns and shops and modes of \ntransport with people of other identities, if you trust the rule of law and you trust \nthe central government to provide services including security within which those \ndifferent identities can live without harming each other. If you take the security \naway, you take those government services away, and move into the politics of \ninsecurity. Then people of a particular identity are suspicious of any people of any \nother identity in case they are a danger to them, and when insecurity becomes \nalmost total in your daily life and in your perceptions of your society the most \ndangerous people to you are those who are geographically closest to you of a \ndifferent identity.\n23\n \n \nThis can clearly be seen in what has happened in Baghdad, but also in other parts of the country. \nAs two of our interviewees noted, the parallels with Hobbes are striking.\n24\n While the situation \nhas undeniably been exploited by those opposed to the US for other reasons, and by those who \nseek to use this as an opportunity to settle scores, there is a root problem which stems from the \nactions of the CPA and its successors. There are undoubtedly parallels to Bosnia, as these events \nreinforce the notion that representations of history, identity, and space are intrinsically linked in \nthe production of conflict. While al Shaikly suggested to us that these problems were in part the \nobsession of Western journalists and academics,\n25\n it seems more plausible that they were \nexacerbated by the outcome of the occupation. That they exist today is, it seems, undeniable. As \n 30 \nSimon Jenkins suggested, \u2017there is no self-delusion to which an Iraqi will not be subject if he \nreally wants to\u2026 To say we caused it, fine. To say that we are now talking it up, just flies in the \nface of reality\u2018.26  \nIn addition, such representations are not bounded by the territorial limits of states; the \nimplications of the assault on Iraq having sent significant ripples across the wider Middle East \nand beyond. Indeed, one of the few things all of our interviewees agreed upon was that only by \naddressing the place of Iraq within the wider region and allying its security and prosperity to that \nof its neighbours could any lasting progress be made.\n27\n To this end, gestures towards a regional \nsecurity conference for the Middle East have been recently made.\n28\n At such a conference Iraq\u2018s \nterritorial integrity would no doubt be addressed. For the coalition and elements within the \ngovernment there is a pressing need to remove the influence of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria \nfrom the internal politics of the country (see Samii, 2003). Yet such aspirations will ring hollow \nwhile the US and UK continue to occupy it, even if we believe the claim that this is merely at the \nrequest of the Iraqi government.\n29\n As Bremer recounts, in the 2004 handover Bush expressed a \nclear view about the new Iraqi Prime Minister: \n \nwhoever it is, I want to be sure that he won\u2018t start playing to the gallery by \nattacking the Coalition right after taking office\u2026 we\u2018ve got to be certain the new \nPM won\u2018t ask us to leave the day after sovereignty (Bremer, 2006: 360) \n \nThe Iraq Study Group and the Troop Surge \nThe stability of the Middle East as a whole was a key theme in the recently published report of \nthe Iraq Study Group. They suggest that \u2017no country in the region will benefit in the long term \n 31 \nfrom a chaotic Iraq\u2018 (2006: ix, see 27); yet the key issue here is the \u2017in the long term\u2018. Actually, \nfor a number of neighbours, Syria and Iran among them, having the US bogged down in Iraq \nsubstantially lessens the chance of a US military intervention in their own affairs.\n30\n Equally a \npro-US regime with US bases and preferential oil deals would hardly be in their own interest (see \nHashim, 2006: 136-7). Yet even in the long term these countries interests do not simply coincide. \nSaudi Arabia has reportedly stated that if the US withdraws they will consider arming Sunni \nmilitias in order to protect them from Shiite forces backed by Iran. Turkey has intervened in the \nnorth, partly claiming that this was a question of preserving its own territorial integrity. Indeed \nthe Iraq Study Group recognises this when it suggests that: \u2017Other countries in the region fear \nsignificant violence crossing their borders. Chaos in Iraq could lead those countries to intervene \nto protect their own interests, thereby perhaps sparking a broader regional war\u2018 (2006: 33; see \nGordon and Trainor, 2006: 339).\n31\n Increased tensions between the US and Iran, for a multitude \nof reasons, but in particular accusations by the Americans that Iran is arming Shi\u2018a militias have \ndone little to help the situation in the region (BBC News, 2007). Conversely, elements within \nSaudi Arabia and Syria have been accused by the coalition of aiding Sunni insurgents within \nIraq, both in terms of the supply of arms and funds. (BBC News, 2006c). For some this suggests \nthat Iraq has already become the location for a proxy war between regional powers. \nIn order to address these particular concerns, the report of the Iraq Study Group sets out a \nnumber of key aims. Indeed, its second recommendation, which is the first explicit policy, is that \n\u2017The goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates to regional players should be to: i. Support the \nunity and territorial integrity of Iraq\u2018 (2006: 45). This is explicitly noted in terms of putting \npressure on Iran and Syria in terms of their actions in the region. The report stresses that \u2017Iran \nshould stem the flow of arms and training to Iraq, respect Iraq\u2018s sovereignty and territorial \n 32 \nintegrity\u2018 (2006: xv); and that \u2017Iran should make clear its support for the territorial integrity of \nIraq as a unified state, as well as its respect for the sovereignty of Iraq and its government\u2018 \n(2006: 53). It suggests that the key incentive for these countries is that it will help to create \u2017an \nIraq that does not disintegrate and destabilize its neighbors and the region.\u2018 (2006: 51). \nYet the Iraq Study Group\u2018s call to engage with Iran and Syria may be counter-productive in \nterms of wider US strategy. For concessions from these countries regarding their involvement in \nIraq is likely to be conditional on US non-intervention in their own domestic affairs. As Dodge \nsuggests, \u2017the danger is that, if such an understanding is not brokered, and if Iran\u2018s confrontation \nwith the international community continues, Iraq will become an arena in which regional powers \nuse violence to further their own foreign-policy aims\u2018 (Dodge, 2005: 63). \nThe report is similarly explicit in suggesting that a division \u2013 either into separate states or \ndevolved regions \u2013 is impracticable and undesirable. \n \nThe costs associated with devolving Iraq into three semiautonomous regions with \nloose central control would be too high. Because Iraq\u2018s population is not neatly \nseparated, regional boundaries cannot be easily drawn. All eighteen Iraqi \nprovinces have mixed populations, as do Baghdad and most other major cities in \nIraq. A rapid devolution could result in mass population movements, collapse of \nthe Iraqi security forces, strengthening of militias, ethnic cleansing, \ndestabilization of neighboring states, or attempts by neighboring states to \ndominate Iraqi regions (Baker and Hamilton, 2006: 39). \n \n 33 \nThus, for all the supposed tensions between this report and the Bush administration, this is a \ndispute over tactics rather than strategy. Bush declared in a 2007 speech that \n \nSucceeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing \nthe region in the face of extremist challenges. This begins with addressing Iran \nand Syria. These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their \nterritory to move in and out of Iraq. Iran is providing material support for attacks \non American troops. We will disrupt the attacks on our forces. We'll interrupt the \nflow of support from Iran and Syria. And we will seek out and destroy the \nnetworks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq (Bush, \n2007). \n \nIn these terms it is unsurprising that the report states that  \n \nWe agree with the goal of U.S. policy in Iraq, as stated by the President: an Iraq \nthat can \u2017govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself.\u2018 In our view, this definition \nentails an Iraq with a broadly representative government that maintains its \nterritorial integrity, is at peace with its neighbors, denies terrorism a sanctuary, \nand doesn\u2018t brutalize its own people. Given the current situation in Iraq, achieving \nthis goal will require much time and will depend primarily on the actions of the \nIraqi people (2006: 40). \n \n 34 \nIndeed, the much trumpeted \u2017troop surge\u2018, hailed by some as a major success and by others as a \ncontinual denial of the reality of the situation, simply defers this situation, since it effectively \ndelays the shift to the \u2017actions of the Iraqi people\u2018 (see Dodge 2007). Longer term US plans, \nincluding the establishment of permanent bases and the largest US embassy in the world, and the \ncontinual meddling with government affairs reinforce this trend. \n \nConclusions \nThis puts us effectively back in 2003. For the US and its allies it is essential that the following \nstate of affairs is maintained. Iraq must remain together, but it must demonstrate appropriate \nbehaviour in terms of its neighbours and population. Territorial integrity is thus territorial \npreservation; unity; and the only possibly viability considered and supported is of the entire state. \nYet its sovereignty must remain entirely contingent, for three key reasons. These are exactly the \nsame as the reasons for invasion, and the broader arguments made for the contingency of \nterritorial sovereignty: the stability of the region, including weapons of mass destruction; the \nharbouring of terrorists; and the treatment of its people. While the latter is the basis of \n\u2017humanitarian intervention\u2018, recoded as the \u2017responsibility to protect\u2018; the first two are the key \naims of the \u2017global war on terror\u2018. \nWe thus have a renewed reinforcement of the breaking apart of territorial integrity \u2013 preservation \nof territorial extent but contingency of sovereignty within it. The viability of this remains off the \nofficial agenda, even as realities on the ground make the idea of a unified Iraqi state and territory \nan increasingly apparent fiction. Can the two halves of territorial integrity be put back together or \nis the split irrevocable? If territorial sovereignty is held to be contingent, can challenges to \nterritorial preservation be continually deferred? To put this way, why should the actions of a state \n 35 \nbe limited when the spatial extent of that power is precisely unquestioned? These issues of \ncourse exceed the particular case examined here, and are deeply worrying for many in the \ninternational community, but the relation between Iraq and the international community throws a \nnumber of these issues into stark focus. In terms of Iraq it is difficult to disagree with Galbraith\u2018s \njudgement that the constitution and the effective \u2017three-state solution\u2018 that it implicitly tends \ntoward \u2017could lead to the country\u2018s dissolution\u2018. He suggests that if it does, \u2017there will be no \nreason to mourn Iraq\u2018s passing\u2018 (Galbraith, 2006: 206). The question, of course, is what cost will \nbe incurred by the disintegration of its territorial integrity: invoked, violated, and increasingly \nunviable. \n \nReferences \nAhmed, N., 2003.

These interviewees were chosen either because of their \nknowledge of the situation in Iraq, or because of their views on it. The interviews were \ncompleted over a two-month period during the winter of 2006-07 in London. This \nmethodological approach was adopted to enable analysis to be conducted of how these \ninformed actors understood the notion of territorial integrity as it was being applied by \nthemselves and their peers to Iraq. It should be noted that other key actors\u2014notably \nserving government ministers\u2014were unwilling to be interviewed. \n3\n  Interview with Sir Jeremy Greenstock (former UK Ambassador to the UN and Her \nMajesty\u2018s former Special Representative in Iraq), conducted by Author A, 5th December \n2006; Interview with Clare Short MP (former Secretary of State for International \nDevelopment and Cabinet member), conducted by Author A, 5\nth\n December 2006.  \n4\n  The reference to Kuwait in these resolutions is in part an attempt to tie this crisis back to \nthe 1990-91 invasion of Kuwait, which began the long war against Iraq. For some, the \nauthority to invade was provided by resolution 688, a case which is known as the \u2017revival \nargument\u2018. Greenstock forcefully made this point in his interview with us. \n5\n  Interview with Simon Jenkins (British journalist at the Guardian newspaper), conducted \nby Author A, 6\nth\n December 2006. \n6\n  Interview with Greenstock. \n7\n  For a fuller discussion, see Elden 2008. \n8\n  The territory that the British ruled was composed of three vilayets \u2013 Baghdad, Basra, and \nMosul \u2013 which had been part of the Ottoman Empire. The British Army invaded Basra \nand moved north to Baghdad during the First World War, first to drive out the Ottomans \nand second to access the oil reserves around Basra (Sluglett, 1976). In 1916 the UK and \nFrance signed the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement to carve up the former Ottoman \nterritories in the Middle East (The Geographer, 1970). At the end of the First World War \nthe Treaty of S\u00e8vres was negotiated between the Ottoman government and the allies to \ndelimit Turkey\u2018s borders. Although never ratified due to the Turkish war of independence \nit stipulated that the Turkish\u2013Iraqi border should follow the northern border of Mosul \nvilayet (The Geographer, 1964). Two years later the League of Nations granted control of \nBaghdad, Basra, and Mosul to the UK, with France gaining control of Syria, and the state \nof Iraq was born. Its borders were still to be officially settled, especially those delimiting \nthe boundary with Turkey. The presence of Kurds in Turkey, Iraq and neighbouring \ncountries was problematic, and even though the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne set out plans \nfor the settlement of the Iraq-Turkey boundary within nine months of its ratification this \nnever occurred. The border was finally settled by the Council of the League of Nations is \nOctober 1924. They adopted the \u2017Brussels Line\u2018 which delimited the boundary along the \nMosul vilayet\u2018s boundary (The Geographer, 1964). \n9\n  Interview with Jenkins. \n10\n  Interview with Michael Moore MP (Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman), \nconducted by Author B, 30\nth\n January 2007. \n 42 \n \n11\n  Interview with Iraqi Ambassador to UK, Dr Salah al Shaikly, conducted by Author A, 4\nth\n \nDecember 2006. \n12\n  Interview with Greenstock. \n13\n  Interview with al Shaikly. \n14\n  Interview with al Shaikly. \n15\n  This was a point that was repeatedly made in the interviews, particularly by Labour MP, \nJohn McDonnell (conducted by Author A, 4\nth\n December 2006) and Plaid Cymru MP, \nAdam Price (conducted with Author B, 30\nth\n January 2007). \n16\n  The Iraqi Ambassador disputed this in his interview with us. The recent US troop surge \n can be seen as an acknowledgment that this labelling is not without some validity. \n17\n  Interview with al Shaikly. \n18\n  This opinion was also voiced by Keith Simpson MP (Conservative Foreign Affairs \nspokesman for Middle East affairs) in an interview with Author B, 30\nth\n January 2007 \n19\n  Interview with al Shaikly. \n20\n  See Anderson and Stansfield 2004 for an analysis of the complex, geographically \noverlapping, nature of the ethnic and religious composition of Iraq. Interestingly most of \nour interviewees reinforced this notion, talking about the Sunni Triangle, the Kurdish \nnorth, and referencing Iraq\u2018s geography by its ethnic groups. \n21\n  A view reinforced by Simpson. \n22\n  Interview with Greenstock. \n23\n  Interview with Greenstock. Similar points were made in the interview with Jenkins. \n24\n  Interview with Short; interview with Jenkins. \n25\n  Interview with al Shaikly. \n26\n  Interview with Jenkins. \n27\n  Especially noted by Simpson. \n28\n  Price suggested that such a conference would be significant, both in terms of dealing with \nIraq, but also to start moving towards solutions for conflicts right across the Middle East. \n29\n  This is generally made by the US and UK administrations, and stressed in the interview \nwith Greenstock. \n30\n  As well as many media reports, this point was made to us by al Shaikly. \n31\n  This is a point about the US putting pressure on the Kurds not to push toward Kirkuk and \ngive Turkey a casus belli.  \n"}
