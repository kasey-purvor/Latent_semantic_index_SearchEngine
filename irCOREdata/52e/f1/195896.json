The results of our study also imply that ESTR loci can be regarded as a class of \nexpanded microsatellites, with the mechanism of spontaneous mutation most probably \nattributed to replication slippage. \n  \n 3\nIntroduction \n \n\u00a0 Expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) DNA loci belong to the class of the most \nunstable loci in the mouse genome. They consist of long homogenous arrays of relatively \nshort repeats (4-9 bp) and show a very high spontaneous mutation rate of length changes both \nin germline and somatic cells (Bois et al. 1998). They were originally classified as \nhypervariable mouse minisatellites (Kelly et al. 1989; Gibbs at al. 1993), but have since been \ndistinguished from mini- and micro-satellite loci as they possess some unique characteristics \n(Bois et al. 1998). For example, the bulk of spontaneous mutations at GC-rich human \nminisatellites occur in the germline, with only very rare events taking place in somatic cells \n(Jeffreys at al. 1994). In contrast, ESTRs are equally unstable in the germline and somatic \ntissues (Kelly et al. 1989; Gibbs at al. 1993; Barber et al. 2006; 2009; Hatch et al. 2007). \nHowever, with repeat units of 4-9 base pairs and overall array lengths of up to 22 kb, ESTRs \nare too large for a conventional microsatellite (Ellegren 2004). \nThe mechanisms underlying the very high ESTR spontaneous mutation rate still \nremain poorly understood. The first insights into the mechanisms of ESTR mutation were \nobtained from studies on mutation induction at these loci in the germline of male mice \nexposed either to ionizing radiation (Fan et al. 1995; Dubrova et al. 1998; 2000) or chemical \nmutagens (Vilarino-Guell et al. 2003). The data generated by these studies clearly showed \nthat the observed increases in ESTR mutation rates cannot be attributed to direct targeting of \nthese relatively small genomic loci by mutagens. They also suggested that ESTR mutation \ninduction results from DNA damage occurring elsewhere in the genome and subsequent \nindirect mutation at the ESTR loci. Considering these results and the data on ESTR mutation \nrates in the germline of DNA-repair-deficient mice, we proposed that both spontaneous and \nradiation-induced ESTR mutation is a replication-driven process, and most probably \nattributed to replication slippage (Barber et al. 2004). According to our model, the very high \nspontaneous mutation rate at ESTR loci could be directly related to their very large size (up \nto 3500 repeats) and, probably, the presence of hairpin structures within the arrays which \ntogether may promote polymerase slippages. A comparison of spontaneous ESTR mutation \nfrequencies in flow-sorted fractions of the mouse male germ cells provided further support \nfor this model (Shanks et al. 2008). Our recent data on the effects of fetal irradiation on \nESTR mutation frequencies in the germline and somatic tissues of adult mice imply that \nESTR mutation induction occurs mostly, if not exclusively, in replication-proficient cells \n(Barber et al. 2009). \nThe results of these studies therefore suggest that ESTR loci may be regarded as a \nclass of expanded microsatellites, where the mechanisms underlying spontaneous mutation \nare replication-driven. It should however be noted that numerous studies have identified a \nunique class of the expanded disease-causing human microsatellites (Mirkin 2007), which \nshare a number of common features with mouse ESTR loci. First of all, the size of expanded \nalleles (100+ repeats) is approaching that for the most unstable ESTR loci in the mouse \ngenome, whereas for the majority of \u2018conventional\u2019 microsatellites it seldom exceeds 50 \nrepeats (Ellegren 2004). Most importantly, following the expansion, the disease-causing \nhuman microsatellites become extremely unstable and, in some cases, the frequency of \naccumulated mutations at these loci even exceeds that for ESTRs (Mirkin 2007). However, \nthe mechanisms underlying the very high instability at the expanded disease-causing human \nmicrosatellites are not entirely replication-related. It was shown that instability at these loci is \nattributed to the ability of the repeats to form stable secondary structures, such as hairpins, \ncruciforms, etc (Mirkin 2007). The presence of secondary structures can substantially \npromote replication-slippage events, and also provide the targets for some DNA repair \npathways, including the mismatch and base-excision pathways (Kovtun and McMurray \n 4\n2008). Thus, the mis-repair of secondary structures provides the most plausible explanation \nfor a dramatic age-related expansion of some disease-causing microsatellites in the non-\nreplicating brain (Mirkin 2007; Kovtun and McMurray 2008). Given that the repeats of some \nESTR loci form stable secondary structures (Weitzmann et al. 1998), the contribution of \nDNA repair to the mechanisms underlying spontaneous mutation at these loci can also be \nsuspected. \nGiven that replication errors, including DNA polymerase slippage events, should result in a \nsubstantial age-related accumulation of mutations (Vijg 2007), a detailed analysis of ESTR \nmutation frequencies in aging mice may provide further insights into the mechanisms of \nspontaneous mutation at these loci. Here, using single-molecule PCR (SM-PCR), we have \nstudied the effect of age on ESTR mutation accumulation in the mouse tissues with different \ncell-proliferative activity during adulthood. \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nF1 C57BL\/6 x CBA\/Ca F1 hybrid male mice were purchased from Harlan (Bicester, \nUK) and maintained up to 96 weeks of age at the Biomedical Services Unit of University of \nLeicester. The mice were maintained on a 12-hour light\/12-hours dark cycle at a standard \ntemperature of 19-23oC. Standard lab chow LabDiet 5LF2 and water were supplied ad \nlibitum. \nCaudal epidydimi, brain and bone marrow (BM) were collected from four groups of \nmice sacrificed at 12, 26, 48 and 96 weeks of age. DNA samples were prepared in a laminar \nflow hood as previously described (Barber et al. 2006). Approximately 5 \u03bcg of each DNA \nsample was digested with 20 U MseI for 2 h at 37oC; MseI cleaves outside the ESTR array \nand distal to the PCR primer sites used for PCR amplification and was used to render \ngenomic DNA fully soluble prior to dilution. Each digested DNA sample was diluted to \napproximately 10 ng ml\u22121 in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in the presence of 5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 carrier \nherring sperm DNA (Sigma, Dorset, UK) prior to mutation analysis. \n The frequency of ESTR mutation was evaluated using SM-PCR (Yauk et al. 2002; \nBarber et al. 2006). The Ms6-hm ESTR locus was amplified in 10 \u03bcl reactions using 0.4 \u03bcM \nflanking primers HM1.1F (5\u2032-AGA GTT TCT AGT TGC TGT GA-3\u2032) and HM1.1R (5\u2032-GAG \nAGT CAG TTC TAA GGC AT-3\u2032). The Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, \nMannheim, Germany) was used (0.035 U\/\u03bcl) with 1 M Betaine and 200 \u03bcM each dNTP. \nAmplification was carried out at 96oC (20 sec), 58oC (30 sec), 68oC (8 min) for 30 cycles on \na PTC-225 DNA Engine Tetrad (MJ Research, Waltham, Mass). To increase the robustness \nof the estimates of individual ESTR mutation frequencies, on average 150 amplifiable \nmolecules were analyzed for each tissue for each male mouse. \nPCR products were resolved on a 40 cm long agarose gel and detected by Southern \nblot hybridization as previously described (Dubrova et al. 1998). The frequencies of ESTR \nmutation and standard errors were estimated using a modified approach proposed by \nChakraborty (Zheng et al. 2000). DNA fragment sizes were estimated by the method of \nSouthern (Southern 1979), with a 200 bp DNA Step Ladder (Promega, Madison, WI) \nincluded on all gels. \n \nResults \nMutation Detection \n \nESTR mutations in the mouse tissues were detected using SM-PCR. This technique \ninvolves the dilution of bulk genomic DNA followed by the amplification of multiple \nsamples, each containing approximately one ESTR molecule (Yauk et al. 2002). The \n 5\nfrequency of ESTR mutation was analyzed at the Ms6-hm locus, which consists of a \nhomogeneous array of the pentanucleotide repeat GGGCA (Kelly et al. 1989). According to \nthe results of our previous studies, the frequency and spectra of somatic and germline \nmutation at this locus accumulated in young male mice (8-12 weeks old) do not substantially \ndiffer (Yauk et al. 2002; Barber et al. 2006; 2009; Hatch et al. 2007). \nAs in a number of our previous studies (Yauk et al. 2002; Glen et al. 2008), we have \nused F1 C57BL\/6 x CBA\/Ca F1 hybrid male mice. These mice possess two differently-sized \nMs6-hm alleles, derived from the C57BL\/6 (~4.6 kb) and CBA\/H (~3.3 kb) inbred strains, \nwhich substantially facilitates ESTR mutation scoring and provides the exact establishing of \nthe allelic origin of mutants (fig. 1A). As in a number of previous studies on mutation \ndetection at ESTR loci (Yauk et al. 2002; Dubrova 2005; Barber et al. 2006; 2009; Glen et al. \n2008), PCR products showing a shift of at least 1 mm relative to the progenitor allele were \nscored as mutant Ms6-hm molecules. Given the size of the Ms6-hm repeat unit of 5 bp (Kelly \net al. 1989), the 1 mm shift corresponded to the gain or loss of 3 and 8 repeats for the CBA \nand C57BL alleles, respectively. This difference was attributed to the resolution of agarose \ngel electrophoresis within the range of two progenitor alleles. \n \nESTR mutation frequencies \n \n A summary of ESTR mutation data is presented in Table 1. Within the group of \nyoung 12-week-old males, the frequencies of ESTR mutation across all tissues did not \nsignificantly differ (fig. 1B). However, in the later cohorts mutation frequency in sperm \nshowed a highly significant elevation, whereas in brain it remained unchanged. Within the \ngroup of old mice (48 and 96 weeks of age) significant increases were also detected in the \nBM tissue. The age-related changes in ESTR mutation frequency were equally evident \namong the mutants detected at the CBA and C57BL alleles in sperm (fig. 1C) and BM (data \nnot shown). \n A comparison of age-related changes in ESTR mutation frequencies revealed clear-\ncut differences in the pattern of mutation accumulation in the mouse tissues. The most \npronounced accumulation of ESTR mutation was observed in DNA samples extracted from \nsperm of old mice. Given that spermatogenesis in the adult mice is an ongoing process, \ncharacterized by a very high proliferation activity of stem cells (de Roou and Russell 2000), \nthe age-related increases in ESTR mutation frequency in this tissue can therefore be \nexplained by accumulation of replication-driven mutations. Indeed, the lack of any \nmeasurable accumulation of ESTR mutations in the brain of aging mice provides further \nsupport for this notion. It is well established that, although new neurons are added to the adult \nbrain, the overall proliferative activity of this tissue during adulthood is extremely low (Gross \n2000). At the first glance, our results showing a moderate age-related increase in the \nfrequency of ESTR mutation in the BM tissue are not entirely in line with the sperm data. \nIndeed, haemopoiesis is a dynamic process maintained by the constant proliferation of BM \nstem cells, and approximate cell cycle duration in adult mice of 3 days (Cheshier et al. 1999). \nGiven this, a considerable age-related accumulation of ESTR mutations in BM, similar to that \nin sperm, is also expected. However, it should be stressed that the percentage of stem cells in \nmouse BM is very low (~9\/105 cells, see M\u00fcller-Seiburg and Riblet 1996) and the samples \nextracted from this tissue are thus enriched with the genomes of non-dividing supporting \ncells. Our data on the age-related differences in the pattern of mutation accumulation are \ntherefore highly consistent with the proposed involvement of DNA replication in spontaneous \nESTR mutation. \n An analysis of the spectra of ESTR mutation accumulated in the aging mice provided \nfurther evidence for the hypothesized role of DNA replication as the main mechanism \n 6\nunderlying spontaneous ESTR mutation. As already mentioned, the presence of secondary \nstructures can substantially destabilize some human trinucleotide microsatellite loci in non-\nreplicating tissues, including brain (Mirkin 2007). The resulted age-related accumulation of \nmicrosatellite mutations at these loci is accompanied by a drastic shift in their spectrum, with \na disproportionally high representation of gains (Mirkin 2007). According to our data (fig. \n1D), this is not the case for ESTR mutations, as their spectra in young and old animals do not \nsignificantly differ. Besides, the spectra of ESTR mutations accumulated in the tissues with \ndifferent proliferation capacity during adulthood appear to be practically indistinguishable. \nConsidering the results of our current and previous studies (Shanks et al. 2008), we therefore \nconclude that spontaneous ESTR mutations occur almost exclusively in replication-proficient \ncells. \n \nRate and spectrum of ESTR mutation \n \n Here we developed a model that describes ESTR mutation accumulation and predicts \nthe distribution of mutant alleles in the tissues of aging mice. To model the ESTR mutation \nprocess, we assumed that it is symmetric, i.e. the probability of a mutation leading to the gain \nof k repeat units is equal to that for the loss of the same number of units. Using the approach \npreviously used to describe the mutational process at conventional microsatellite loci in \nhumans (Di Rienzo et al. 1994), we next approximated the distribution of ESTR mutations \noccurring during DNA replication by a symmetric geometric distribution, P{\u03be=k| \u03be \u22600} = \n2\n1  \np (1 \u2013 p)|k|-1, k\u22651, where p is the fraction of mutations involving the gain or loss of one repeat \nunit (see further details below). Here we assumed that this fraction is similar for the mutants \nderived from the CBA\/Ca and C57BL\/6 alleles. \nESTR mutation accumulation was modeled in brain and sperm; the two tissues \nshowing the most extreme patterns of the age-related changes in ESTR mutation frequencies. \nGiven that the adult mouse brain consists of ~108 cells (Williams 2000) and assuming the \ndichotomous pattern of cell proliferation, this number can be reached by at least 27 cell \ndivisions (227 \u2248 1.3 x 108). In the model we therefore set the number of cell divisions in this \ntissue to range between 27 and 33. \nThe total population of stem cells in the mouse testicles consists of 70x103 cells \n(Tegelenbosch and de Rooji 1993); this number can be reached by at least 16 cell divisions \noccurring from embryonic age to puberty. Male mice become sexually mature at the age of \n~35 days, and after this point then the undifferentiated As spermatogonia undergo one mitotic \ndivision per ~2.8 days (de Roou and Russell 2000). Besides, during spermatogenesis each \nspermatogonium goes through 8 rounds of DNA replication before differentiating into \nspermatocytes (de Roou and Russell 2000). Using these data, the total number of cell \ndivisions that have occurred from early embryonic development until the age of 12 weeks (84 \ndays) is 16 + (84 \u2013 35)\/2.8 + 8 = 43. For the later cohorts the number of cell divisions until \nthe age of 26, 48 and 96 weeks is 62, 117 and 237, respectively. \n \nModel \n \nWe assume that mutations in the two alleles happen independently and explain our \nmodel for one of the alleles. The model rests on simplified assumptions about growth of \ntissues and mutations but captures the main features of these processes. \nWe split the process of cell division into two stages. The first stage corresponds to the \nperiod when tissues grow and it lasts until an animal becomes mature, when the second stage \nbegins. \n 7\nThe first stage is modeled as follows. Consider a parent cell with the number of \nlost\/gained repeats x0. The parent cell, after some time, splits into 2 cells, which have the \nnumber of lost\/gained repeats x0 + \u03be1 and x0 + \u03be2 , respectively. The random variables \u03be1 and \n\u03be2 are independent; they are independent of x0 and have the identical distribution: \n \n    Prob( \u03be = 0 ) = 1 \u2013 \u03bc ,      (1) \n \nwhich is the probability that no mutation happens and \u03bc is the probability of mutation per \ndivision (mutation rate), and \n   Prob( \u03be = j ) = \n2\n\u03bc  p (1 \u2013 p)| j | -1, j = \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .,   (2) \nwhich are probabilities that j repeats are lost\/gained per division. The parameter 0 < p < 1 is \nthe fraction of mutations involved in the gain or loss of a single repeat unit. The distribution \n(1)-(2) is symmetric around 0, which corresponds to our experimental data as discussed \nabove. Variance of \u03be is equal to  \n    Var ( \u03be ) = \u03bc 2\n2\np\np\u2212  .      (3) \nWe note that the first stage is modeled via the branching tree. We also remark that it is \nassumed that the very initial cell at the animal birth has x0 = 0. \n Denoted by Zk(n| x0), a number of cells which after n divisions starting from the cell \nwith x0 have k lost\/gained repeats. It obviously depends on a realization \u03c9 of the branching \ntree, i.e. on an animal in the experiment, and its more detailed notation is Zk(n| x0) (\u03c9). The \ncollection Z(n| x0) (\u03c9) = { Zk(n| x0) (\u03c9), k = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .} gives us a population living on a \nset of whole numbers and \u2211\u221e\n\u2212\u221e=\n=\nk\nn\nk xnZ 2))(|( 0 \u03c9 . In the experiment we randomly (with the \nmeaning, each time independently from each other) take cells from an animal of a particular \nage (i.e. after a particular number of cell divisions n) which corresponds to a random draw \nfrom the population Z(n| x0) (\u03c9) and probability to select a cell with k lost\/gained repeats \nfrom this population is equal to Zk(n| x0)\/2n. Now we introduce an averaged characteristic \nused in the calibration of the model as explained below. Assume that we can put together all \npossible realizations of the branching trees Z(n| x0) (\u03c91), Z(n| x0) (\u03c92), . . . after n divisions \n(i.e., animals with all possible lost\/gained repeats combinations occurring during n divisions), \nthen the proportion of cells with k lost\/gained repeats in this total collection is equal to \n  ,)|(E\n2\n1)|(\n2\n)|( 00,\n2\n1\n0 xnZxnq\njxnQ knjk\nj\nnk\nn\n== \u2211\n=\n \nwhere \nqk,j(n| x0) = Prob( Zk(n| x0) = j ) \n \nand E(\u0387) stands for expectation. According to equations (1)-(2), we introduce the transition \nmatrix P={pij} such that pii =1 \u2013 \u03bc and pij = pji = \n2\n\u03bc  p (1 \u2013 p)|j-i| -1 for i \u2260 j . If the distribution of \nloss\/gained repeats x0 at the roots of the branching trees under consideration is \u03c00 then one \ncan show that the distribution of lost\/gained repeats after n divisions \u03c0n is equal to  \n \n    \u03c0n = \u03c00 Pn .       (4) \n \nIf the branching trees start at birth of animals then x0 = 0 for all the initial roots and, hence, \n\u03c00(0) = 1 and \u03c00(k) = 0 for all k \u2260 0. We also note that, e.g., Qk( n |x0 ) = \u03c0n(k). \nWe model the second stage of cell division in sperm (when an animal is mature and \nthe tissue is not growing) as follows. A parent stem cell with the number of lost\/gained \n 8\nrepeats x0 dies after some time and results in a new stem cell with the number of lost\/gained \nrepeats x0 + \u03be  (where \u03be is independent of x0 and distributed according to equations (1)-(2)). \nThus, the second stage is modeled via a Markov chain. If an initial distribution of x0 is \u03c00, \nthen after n divisions the distribution of loss\/gained repeats \u03c0n is given by equation (4) again. \n \nCalibration of the model  \n \n Our model has two parameters \u03bc (mutation rate) and p (the fraction of mutations \ninvolving the gain or loss of a single repeat unit), which we estimated based on the \nexperimental data for brain and sperm. It is assumed that for a particular allele the mutation \nrate \u03bc is the same for both brain and sperm and that the value of p is the same for both alleles \nand both tissues. \nAs discussed above, no measurable accumulation of ESTR mutation was detected in \nthe brain of aging mice. Then we assume that all the mutations in the brain happen during the \nfetal and early post-natal stages of development until maturity of animals, which consists of \n27-33 divisions. Consequently, we consider brain data from animals of all ages as \u201cfrozen\u201d \n(in terms of mutation accumulation) at the date of their maturity. This results in a larger set of \ndata available for calibrating the model in the case of the brain tissue than in the case of \nsperm, making the brain calibration more statistically reliable.  \nWe first calibrated the model on the brain data. The calibration was done via \nmatching the following characteristics of the experimental data with the model: (i) the \nvariance of the mutations (for the model it is equal to N \u03bc (2 \u2013 p) \/ p2 with N being the \nnumber of divisions; eq. (3)); (ii) the proportion of non-mutants (due to methodological limits \nin the resolving power of ESTR allelic size variants, we are restricted to measuring cells with \nno more than 2 and 7 lost\/gained repeats for the CBA\/Ca and C57BL\/6 alleles, respectively); \n(iii) the proportion of the main class of mutants (i.e. those with more than 2 and less than 8 \nlost\/gained repeats) among all mutants for the CBA\/Ca allele. An acceptable match was \nachieved for p = 0.4 and \u03bc being equal to 0.01 and 0.04 for the CBA\/Ca and C57BL\/6 alleles, \nrespectively. Then these calibrated values were verified on the sperm data using similar \ncharacteristics as described above. Finally, the distributions of mutants according to equation \n(4) with the calibrated values of \u03bc and p were obtained for brain and for sperm of animals of \nvarious ages. Fig 2A,B represent the observed and expected distribution of ESTR mutants \naccumulated in the sperm and brain of aging mice. For both tissues the best fit was obtained \nby assuming that the fraction of mutations involving the gain or loss of one repeat unit was \n0.4, and that the mutation rates per cell division were 0.01 and 0.04 for the CBA\/Ca and \nC57BL\/6 alleles, respectively. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe predicted rates of ESTR mutation obtained in this study are much higher than \nthose for mammalian protein coding genes and microsatellite loci. For example, the in vivo \nmutation rate at the human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosil transferase (hprt) locus is 5 \nx 10-7 per cell division (Morley 1996); for replication-driven mutation at conventional \nmammalian microsatellites it ranges between 10-6 to 10-4 per cell division (Seyfert et al. \n2008). It should be noted that our estimates are close to those for the class of highly unstable \nhuman GC-rich minisatellites, with the rate of spontaneous mutation in the paternal germline, \nranging from 0.5 up to 13% per gamete (Vergnaud and Denoeud F. 2000). However, as \nalready mentioned, mutations at human minisatellites almost exclusively occur during \nmeiosis and are attributed to complex gene-conversion like events, whereas in somatic tissues \nthese loci are quite stable (Jeffreys et al. 1994; 1998). In contrast, the obtained estimates of \n 9\nESTR mutation rate in the mouse germline and brain are remarkably similar. If correct, then \nthe observed differences in the frequencies of ESTR mutation accumulated in sperm and \nbrain are attributed to age-related differences in the number of cell divisions that occurred in \nthese tissues. Considering these data, we therefore conclude that the Ms6-hm locus can be \nregarded as the most unstable locus in the mouse genome. \nDespite the fact that in all tissues the observed frequency of ESTR mutation at the \nCBA\/Ca allele significantly exceeds that for the C57BL allele, the estimates of mutation rate \nfor this larger allele are at least 4-fold higher than those for the smaller CBA\/Ca allele. This \ndata is consistent with the results of a previous analysis of inter-strain variation in ESTR \nmutation frequencies in the mouse germline (Dubrova 2005). Our current and previous data \ntherefore point toward the presence of a positive correlation between the ESTR mutation rate \nand allele size. It should be noted that such a correlation was also reported for conventional \nmammalian microsatellites (Ellegren 2004). Given that the increased number of repeats can \nfurther promote polymerase slippage events, the difference in the estimates of mutation rates \nfor the large and smaller ESTR alleles provides more evidence for a replication-driven \nmechanism of spontaneous mutation at these loci. \nAlthough our study has revealed a number of striking similarities between \nconventional microsatellites and ESTR loci, the pattern of mutational processes at these loci \ndiffers. Using the most representative set of data on 3135 de novo paternal microsatellite \nmutations found in humans (Parentage Testing Standards Program Unit 2004), we compared \nthe observed spectrum of microsatellite mutations with the geometric distribution of ESTR \nmutations used in our model (fig. 2C). While the majority of microsatellite mutations (90%) \ninvolved the gain or loss of one repeat unit, the best approximation of the ESTR data was \nobtained by assuming that only 40% of ESTR mutations belonged to this class. The presence \nof a considerable number of mutants involved the gain or loss of a substantial number of \nrepeat units clearly differentiates the spectra of ESTR and microsatellite mutations. It should \nhowever be stressed that our data does not necessarily imply that these large mutational \nevents arise at one site within the array, as multiple single-step mutational events could also \noccur along the large number of repeats within ESTR loci. Unfortunately, given that the Ms6-\nhm locus consists of homogeneous array repeats (Kelly et al. 1989), even the direct \nsequencing of mutants cannot provide further information regarding their origin. \n According to our experimental data, the frequency of ESTR mutation accumulated in \nsperm reaches 0.35 and 0.20 for the CBA\/Ca and C57BL\/6 alleles, respectively (fig. 1D). As \na substantial number of ESTR mutants at these alleles cannot be detected by agarose \nelectrophoresis, for each allele we estimated the frequency of all mutations accumulated in \nthe proliferating tissues, as well as their \u201cobserved\u201d frequency, assuming that the mutant \nbands showing at least \u00b1 3 (CBA\/Ca allele) and \u00b1 8 repeats (C57BL\/6 allele) were scored as \nmutants. For both alleles, the total frequency of accumulated mutations substantially \nexceeded the \u201cobserved\u201d (fig. 2D). The gap between the two estimates was particularly \npronounced for the C57BL mutants, where the total frequency of ESTR mutation reached a \nhigh of 0.9 within the range of observed frequencies, and a low of 0.15. We therefore \nconclude that the observed frequencies of ESTR mutation, reported here and in all previous \nstudies, represent a substantial 2-4 fold underestimate of their total frequency. Given that the \nexpected frequency of ESTR mutation accumulation in old animals is ~0.6 and ~0.9 for the \nCBA\/Ca and C57BL\/6 alleles, respectively, our data therefore suggest that up to 95% of stem \ncells in the testicles of old mice should contain at least one ESTR mutation. The pattern of \nage-related accumulation of ESTR mutations in actively proliferating tissues therefore \nresembles that for the most unstable expanded disease-causing human microsatellites (Mirkin \n2007), thus indicating that these two classes of tandem repeat loci may be equally unstable. \n 10\n In conclusion, the results of our study provide strong evidence for replication-driven \nmechanisms underlying spontaneous mutation at ESTR loci. Considering these data and the \nresults of other publications, it therefore appears that spontaneous ESTR mutation is mostly \nattributed to replication slippage and these loci may therefore be regarded as a class of \nexpanded microsatellites. Our estimates of ESTR spontaneous mutation rate clearly show that \nsome of these loci belong to the most unstable loci in the mammalian genome. It should also \nbe noted that since 1993 these loci have extensively been used for the analysis of mutation \ninduction in the germline of male mice exposed to ionizing radiation, chemical mutagens and \nanticancer drugs (Dubrova et al. 1993; 1998; 2000; Fan et al. 1995; Vilarino-Guell et al. \n2003; Glen et al. 2008). The results of our study are therefore important in furthering our \nunderstanding of the mechanisms of mutation induction at these loci. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nWe thank the Division of Biomedical Services, University of Leicester for their expert animal \ncare.
