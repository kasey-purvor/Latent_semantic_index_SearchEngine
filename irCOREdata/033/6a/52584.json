We analyze a survey of soil arsenic, copper, lead, and tin at 372 lo-5\ncations around Swansea (Wales, UK). We use the approach of Hamon et al. (2004) to6\ndetermine the native metal concentrations in contaminated regions from the iron con-7\ntent. However we find that this indicator is not appropriate around Swansea because8\nthe iron content is elevated across the contaminated region. Therefore the natural9\nconcentration of each metal is approximated by the median concentration on nearby10\nuncontaminated rural soils on the same parent material. We divide the remaining vari-11\nation between diffuse pollution and point source pollution by the robust winsorizing12\nalgorithm of Hawkins & Cressie (1984). This leads to a plausible log-Gaussian model13\nwith a constant mean which represents the diffuse pollution and estimates of the con-14\ntribution of point-source pollution at each observation site. Point source pollution is15\nfound to occur at sites historically associated with production, transport and disposal16\nof industrial wastes. The pattern of diffuse pollution is consistent with emissions from17\nmultiple smelters located throughout urban Swansea and the effects of prevailing wind18\nand topography are evident.19\n2\nIntroduction20\nSoil contamination because of human activity has been identified as one of the ma-21\njor threats to soil function by the European Union in their thematic strategy for soil22\nprotection (Commission of the European Communities, 2006). National governments23\nacross the EU have separate legal frameworks for dealing with historic soil contamina-24\ntion. Local agencies with statutory responsibilities for the assessment and remediation25\nof soil contamination require effective methods to map the magnitude and extent of26\npollution. The spatial distribution of metal and metalloid contaminants in the soil is27\noften complex because the effects of natural sources of metals are combined with dif-28\nfuse and point-source pollution. Our understanding of the processes can be enhanced29\nby spatial predictions of the variations due to each of these three separate sources. In30\nareas of widespread soil contamination, knowledge of the relative proportions of metal31\narising from natural and anthropogenic sources could aid quantitative assessments of32\nrisk to human health since the bioaccessibility of a soil contaminant can be related to33\nthe chemical form in which it entered the soil (Smith et al., 2008).34\nGenerally, regional estimates of the contribution of natural sources to metal con-35\ncentrations in contaminated soil are made from the summary statistics of surveys made36\nin areas which are assumed to be unaffected by anthropogenic processes. It is possi-37\nble to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources of some elements such38\nas lead by the stable isotopes (Clark et al., 2006) but in other cases the metals may39\nonly have one stable isotope or analytical methods may not be widely available for the40\ndetermination of isotope fractions (e.g. copper and tin). Hamon et al. (2004) tested41\nwhether various soil properties could be used as indicators of the background or nat-42\nural metal content of contaminated soils. They found that the natural concentrations43\nof arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc could be approximated in44\nterms of the iron and manganese concentrations in the soil. Their tests were conducted45\nin south-east Asia but they suggest that these relationships may hold worldwide. This46\napproach assumes that the iron content of contaminated soils is not elevated by an-47\n3\nthropogenic processes. Such behaviour has been observed in previous surveys of urban48\nsoil contamination in the UK. For example, Figure 1 shows that metal processing in49\nSheffield has enriched the lead content of the soils in comparison with uncontaminated50\nrural soils, but the iron content is relatively unchanged.51\nConventional geostatistical methods are most efficient when the property being52\nmapped approximates, or may be transformed to approximate, a Gaussian distribution.53\nHowever point-sources of pollution lead to hotspots or outliers in the distribution of soil54\nmetals which are inconsistent with the Gaussian assumption. Therefore robust geosta-55\ntistical methods have been applied to surveys of soil metal pollution. Robust methods56\nestimate the statistics of the underlying variation of metal concentrations with mini-57\nmum effect of outliers. In geostatistical analysis we first estimate a variogram model58\nwhich describes the spatial variation of the property of interest based upon the obser-59\nvations. This model is then used to predict the property at unsampled locations. In60\nconventional geostatistics the variogram model is estimated by Matheron\u2019s method of61\nmoments estimator (Webster & Oliver, 2007). This estimator is sensitive to outlying62\nobservations. Therefore robust variogram estimators have been devised that model the63\nunderlying variation in the presence of outliers. Three such robust estimators were64\ncompared by Lark (2000). Lark (2002) suggested a statistic which may be used to65\nidentify outlying observations. This statistic was used to identify outliers in surveys of66\nheavy metal contamination in Sheffield, UK (Rawlins et al., 2005) and Zhangjiagang,67\nChina (Zhao et al., 2007). The outliers were removed from the datasets before the68\ndiffuse pollution was predicted across these study regions. However, although outliers69\nare likely to be dominated by point-source pollution they may still contain information70\nabout the diffuse pollution. Therefore Marchant et al. (2010) used a robust prediction71\nalgorithm (Hawkins & Cressie, 1984) to winsorize the observations. This winsorizing72\nprocess separated each observation into two components, one because of localized pro-73\ncesses and one because of diffuse processes. A similar approach was applied by Papritz74\n(2007) when mapping pollution around a Swiss smelter.75\n4\nAlthough the winsorizing algorithm of Hawkins & Cressie (1984) was devised76\nmore than 25 years ago it has not been widely applied. Instead Reimann et al. (2005)77\nindentified outliers in geochemical data by looking at properties of the empirical data78\ndistribution. This approach does not account for the dependence structure of the data79\nand therefore does not explore whether the outliers are extreme relative to their nearest80\nneighbours. The local Moran\u2019s I statistic used by Zhang et al. (2008) does compare each81\nobservation with its neighbours but the weight applied to each neighbour is selected82\narbitrarily. In contrast the winsorizing algorithm of Hawkins & Cressie (1984) ensures83\nthat the amount of influence each neighbour has is determined from a robust model of84\nthe underlying variation of the property.85\nIn this paper we are concerned with mapping the metal content of soils around86\nthe Swansea and Neath Valleys (Wales, UK) based upon a survey of 390 observations87\nmade at 372 sites. Swansea was the world-centre of copper-smelting in the late 18th88\nand early 19th centuries and there were other non-ferrous smelters processing arsenic,89\nlead, zinc, silver and tin. Our aim is to quantify the effects of diffuse pollution across90\nthe study region. We test whether the natural soil content of arsenic, copper, lead91\nand tin can be related to the concentrations of iron by conducting a second survey92\nin a rural area that is not contaminated. We subtract our estimate of natural metal93\nconcentrations from the urban observations and separate the anthropogenic metal con-94\ncentrations which remain into components due to diffuse and point-source pollution by95\nrobust geostatistical methods. This analysis yields a continuous map of diffuse metal96\npollution across the region and estimates of the point-source pollution at each obser-97\nvation site. We interpret the patterns of point-source and diffuse pollution in relation98\nto maps of current and historical land use, and two factors which dominate deposition99\nof airborne metals: prevailing wind and topography.100\nTheory101\nGeostatistical Prediction of Soil Properties102\nThe variation of a soil property may be described by the linear mixed model (LMM)103\n5\nwhich divides the spatial variation between fixed and random effects (Lark & Cullis,104\n2004) and accounts for variation between observations made at the same site which105\nwe may think of as measurement error. The fixed effects are a linear combination of q106\ncovariates and represent variation of the expectation of the property across the study107\nregion. The random effects describe the spatially correlated component of variation of108\nthe property. The LMM is written109\nz =M\u03b2 + Zu+ \u03b5, (1)\nwhere z is a length n vector of observations of the property of interest at ns \u2264 n110\ndistinct sites, the matrix M (n \u00d7 q) is the design matrix for the fixed effects and111\ncontains values of the covariate at each observation site, the vector \u03b2 of length q112\ncontains the fixed effects coefficients, the n\u00d7 ns matrix Z is the random effects design113\nmatrix, the vector u of length ns contains the random effects and the length n vector \u03b5114\ncontains measurement errors. The design matrix Z allows multiple observations from115\nthe same location to be included. If observation i is made at site j then element (i, j)116\nof Z is 1. The other elements of the jth column are 0. The random effects are assumed117\nto be a realization of a Gaussian random function U with expectation zero across118\nthe study region and covariance matrix V. If the assumption of Gaussian underlying119\nrandom effects is not plausible for a particular dataset then a transformation should120\nbe applied. The measurement errors are assumed to be independent realizations of a121\nGaussian function with expectation zero and variance \u03c32\u03b5 . The measurement errors can122\nbe distinguished from the nugget variation only if n > ns.123\nThe elements of V are obtained from a parametric function C(h) where h is the124\nlag vector separating two observations. It is common in the geostatistical literature for125\nthe spatial covariance of a random variable to be expressed in terms of the variogram126\n\u03b3 (h) =\n1\n2\nE\n[\n{U (x)\u2212 U (x+ h)}2\n]\n. (2)\nFor a second order stationary random variable127\nC (h) = C (0)\u2212 \u03b3 (h) . (3)\n6\nThe variogram may vary with both the length and direction of h. In this paper we128\nassume that the function is isotropic and varies only according to the length of h which129\nwe denote h.130\nA number of authorized variogram functions have been suggested which ensure131\nthat V is positive definite. One such example is the Mate\u00b4rn function (Mate\u00b4rn, 1960)132\n\u03b3 (h) = c0 + c1\n{\n1\u2212 1\n2\u03bd\u22121\n\u0393 (\u03bd)\n(\nh\na\n)\u03bd\nK\u03bd\n(\nh\na\n)}\nfor h > 0,\n\u03b3 (h) = 0 for h = 0, (4)\nwhere c0 is the nugget variance, c1 is the partial sill variance, a is a distance parameter,133\n\u03bd is a smoothness parameter, K\u03bd is a modified Bessel function of the second kind of134\norder \u03bd (Abramowitz & Stegun, 1972) and \u0393 is the gamma function.135\nConventionally the covariance parameters \u03b1 = [c0, c1, a, \u03bd, \u03c3\n2\n\u03b5 ] are fitted by Math-136\neron\u2019s method of moments (Webster & Oliver, 2007). A point estimate of the variogram137\nis made for several lag distances h based upon the mean squared difference between138\nobservations separated by lag h and a model is fitted to this point estimate by weighted139\nleast squares (Webster & Oliver, 2007). If the mean of the property varies over the140\nstudy region then an initial estimate of the fixed effects coefficient can be made by141\nleast squares and the variogram is fitted to the residuals rather than the observations.142\nOnce the covariance parameters of the LMM have been fitted they may be substituted143\ninto the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) to calculate \u03b2\u0302, an estimate of the fixed144\neffects parameters and Z\u0302(x0) a prediction of the soil property at unobserved site x0.145\nThe BLUP, which is often referred to as universal kriging or kriging with external drift146\nwhen fixed effects are included, also yields an estimate of the prediction variance \u03c32147\nat each unobserved site. The BLUP predictions are weighted sums of the observations148\nwith the weights \u03bb determined according to the LMM.149\nThe validity of the fitted LMM may be confirmed by leave-one-out cross vali-150\ndation. For each sampling location i = 1, . . . n, the value of the property at site xi151\nis predicted by the BLUP using z(\u2212i), the vector of observations excluding z (xi) to152\n7\ncalculate153\n\u03b8i =\n{\nz (xi)\u2212 Z\u02dc(\u2212i)\n}2\n\u03c32(\u2212i)\n, (5)\nwhere Z\u02dc(\u2212i) and \u03c32(\u2212i) denote the prediction and prediction variance at xi when z (xi)154\nis omitted from the transformed observation vector. If the fitted model is a valid155\nrepresentation of the spatial variation of the soil property and the prediction errors are156\nGaussian then \u03b8 = [\u03b81 . . . \u03b8n]\nT is a realization of a \u03c721 distribution with mean \u03b8\u00af = 1.0157\nand median \u03b8\u02d8 = 0.455. Quantile-quantile (QQ) plots of the (\u03b8i)\n1\n2 can be drawn to158\nconfirm that the assumption of Gaussian errors is reasonable.159\nRobust Geostatistical Methods160\nThe LMM representation of spatial properties assumes that the random effects can be161\ntransformed to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. However this assumption will not162\nbe plausible if the variation of a property due to an underlying process is contaminated163\nat a small proportion of sites by a secondary process which leads to the observations164\nat these sites being outliers. In a survey of soil metal pollution the underlying process165\nmay be the diffuse pollution and the secondary process the point-source pollution. The166\nMatheron method of moments estimator is sensitive to outliers which lead to inflated167\nestimates of the variance of the underlying process. Often these estimators ensure168\nthat upon cross-validation \u03b8\u00af \u2248 1.0 but the outliers cause \u03b8\u02d8 to be significantly less169\nthan 0.455. Outliers also have undue influence on BLUP predictions, leading to an170\nexaggeration of the spatial extent of hotspots around an outlier.171\nRobust method of moments variogram estimators have been devised by Cressie172\n& Hawkins (1980), Dowd (1984) and Genton (1998). The methods make robust point173\nestimates of the variogram of the underlying variation. Lark (2000) tested these esti-174\nmators by looking at validation statistics of variogram models fitted to simulated data.175\nHe suggested that \u03b8\u02d8 was a suitable robust statistic to assess the fitted variograms. Lark176\n(2000) found that Matheron\u2019s estimator outperformed the robust estimators when the177\nproperty was not contaminated. However when there was contamination each of the178\nrobust estimators outperformed Matheron\u2019s estimator. The relative performance of the179\n8\nrobust estimators varied with the form of contamination.180\nLark (2002) suggested that once a robust variogram model has been fitted, out-181\nliers could be identified by a threshold on the \u03b8i from cross-validation. Rawlins et al.182\n(2005) followed this approach and removed outliers before predicting soil metal con-183\ncentrations at unsampled sites. However the removal of entire observations discards184\ninformation about the underlying process. Therefore, when analysing a survey of soil185\nmetal contamination across France, Marchant et al. (2010) used a winsorizing algo-186\nrithm suggested by Hawkins & Cressie (1984) to divide each observation between a187\ncomponent from underlying processes and a component from the secondary processes.188\nThey then applied the BLUP to the underlying variation and mapped the observations189\nof the secondary process separately. The steps of this winsorizing algorithm are190\n1. Estimate a robust variogram of z.191\n2. Compute the BLUP weights \u03bbj(\u2212i), j = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1, i + 1, . . . , n required for192\nleave-one-out cross validation and the corresponding kriging variance \u03c32(\u2212i).193\n3. Compute the weighted median z\u02d8(\u2212i) for i = 1 . . . n. The weighted median solves194 \u2211n\nj=1,j 6=i \u03bbj(\u2212i)sign {z\u02d8 (xi)\u2212 z (xj)} = 0, where sign (y) = \u22121 for y < 0 and195\nsign (y) = 1 otherwise. This equation may have more than one solution but196\nHawkins & Cressie (1984) state that the number of solutions is always odd and197\ntherefore a unique solution can be defined by the median of these solutions.198\n4. Winsorize the data by replacing zi by\nzc (xi) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\nz\u02d8(\u2212i) + c\u03c3(\u2212i) if z (xi)\u2212 z\u02d8(\u2212i) > c\u03c3(\u2212i)\nz (xi) if |z (xi)\u2212 z\u02d8(\u2212i)| \u2264 c\u03c3(\u2212i)\nz\u02d8(\u2212i) \u2212 c\u03c3(\u2212i) if z (xi)\u2212 z\u02d8(\u2212i) < \u2212c\u03c3(\u2212i)\n(6)\nwhere c is a constant 1.5 < c < 3.0.199\n5. Predict the property at unsampled locations by application of the BLUP to zc200\nrather than z.201\nMarchant et al. (2010) repeated the above algorithm for different values of c and202\ncalculated cross-validation \u03b8 statistics for each zc. The use of a robust variogram203\n9\nestimator in stage 1 ensured that for large c, \u03b8\u02d8 \u2248 0.455 but in the presence of outliers204\n\u03b8\u00af > 1.0. The value of \u03b8\u00af decreased more rapidly than \u03b8\u02d8 as c was decreased and their205\nfinal prediction of the underlying variation was based upon the zc for which \u03b8\u00af was206\nclosest to 1.0. In the original formulation of the Hawkins & Cressie (1984) algorithm207\nthe mean of z was assumed to be constant and the BLUP in Step 2 was equivalent208\nto ordinary kriging. Papritz (2007) expanded the algorithm to include fixed effects.209\nThe fixed effect coefficients were estimated by a robust regression estimator and the210\nwinsorizing algorithm was applied to the residuals.211\nMethods212\nThe Study Area213\nThe study region encompasses an area of south Wales (UK) shown in Figure 2 with the214\nunderlying soil parent materials (British Geological Survey, 2006). Figure 3 shows the215\nurban area of Swansea and includes the topographic features such as the Swansea and216\nNeath Valleys which extend to the north and north-east from Swansea Bay. For the217\nwider study region, where bedrock is the parent material, it is dominated by medium218\nto coarse-grained sandstone of the Penant Sandstone Formation, which also comprises219\nclaystones, siltstones and minor fine-grained sandstones that contain coal seams. The220\nglacial tills are mostly associated with the Late Devensian glaciation including clasts221\nof Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone from the Brecon Beacons. In222\nthe Swansea Valley, the till deposits are overlain by glaciolacustrine deposits which223\ninclude clay and silt (Figure 3). Glaciolacustrine deposits also occupy the Neath Valley,224\nincluding sand and gravel deposits. During the Holocene, alluvium was deposited and225\npeat deposits formed in upland and lowland areas of restricted drainage. The dominant226\nsoils across the study region have been described as fine loamy soils, sometimes with227\nslight waterlogging (Soil Survey of England and Wales, 1983).228\nIn late 18th and early 19th century Swansea there were many smelters process-229\ning copper, arsenic, lead, zinc, silver and tin. The height of the chimney stacks was230\nincreased in the 19th century to disperse the toxic fumes from the copper smelters.231\n10\nThe lead-smelting industry was particularly significant in the 17th and 19th centuries,232\nalthough compared to copper a greater proportion of smelting was undertaken in the233\nore fields. A total of 250 000 tonnes of raw copper-ore was processed in the Swansea234\nValley annually in the mid 19th century yielding 22 000 tonnes of refined copper; the235\ndominant source of ore was Devon and Cornwall (Hughes, 2000). The copper industry236\nwas considered to be the principal contributor to Swansea\u2019s pollution problems. Newell237\n& Watts (1996) used a Gaussian plume model to estimate annual average suspended238\nairborne concentrations of arsenic, lead and tin during the mid-19th century in the239\nvicinity of the Llanelli copper company 12 miles north-west of Swansea. The estimates240\nwere between 10 and 15 \u00b5g m\u22123. By contrast, current EC regulations stipulate limits of241\n2 \u00b5g m\u22123. More recently remediation has been undertaken; the Lower Swansea Valley242\nproject of the 1960s and 1970s reclaimed slag heaps and large tracts of derelict land.243\nThe Urban Survey244\nSoil samples were collected in 1994 from 372 sites around Swansea on a regular grid245\nat a density of four sites per square kilometre (Figure 3). Marchant & Lark (2007a)246\nand Marchant & Lark (2007b) showed that the efficiency of regular grid surveys could247\nbe greatly improved if a few additional samples were collected from sites close to sites248\non the regular grid. These additional samples lead to a more accurate estimate of the249\nvariogram over small lag distances. Therefore additional samples were collected 20 m250\naway from six of the regular grid sites. At these six sites both the sample from the251\ngrid site and the additional sample 20 m away were split into two subsamples to allow252\nmeasurement errors to be explored. Thus a total of 390 samples were collected.253\nSamples were collected according to the protocols of the Geochemical Surveys of254\nUrban Environments (GSUE) project (Fordyce et al., 2005) across Swansea, Neath,255\nPort Talbot and the Mumbles area of the Gower Peninsula. Sample sites were selected256\nfrom open ground as close as possible to the centre of each of four 500-metre squares,257\nwithin each kilometre square of the British National Grid (BNG). Typical locations258\nfor sampling were gardens, parks, sports fields, road verges, allotments, open spaces,259\n11\nschoolyards and waste ground. Each composite sample was based on nine samples260\nof equal size from the corners, sides and centre of square of side-length 2 m. Each261\nsample was collected at a depth range of 0-15 cm from the soil surface using an auger262\nof diameter 35 mm. At each site, information was recorded on location using 1:10 000263\nscale Ordnance Survey maps, a description of any visible contamination (e.g. metallic,264\npottery, bricks, plastics etc.), Munsell colour, soil clast lithologies (e.g. sandstone,265\nlimestone, etc.) and land use. All soil samples were disaggregated following air-drying266\nand sieved to less than 2 mm. All samples were coned and quartered, and a 50-g267\nsubsample was ground in an agate planetary ball mill. The total concentrations of268\n18 major and trace elements were determined by wavelength and energy dispersive269\nX-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF-S). In this paper we only consider five elements270\n(detection limits in parentheses): arsenic (1 mg kg\u22121), copper (1 mg kg\u22121), total iron271\nexpressed as Fe2O3 (0.01 %), lead (2 mg kg\n\u22121), and tin (1 mg kg\u22121). For brevity we272\nrefer to these variables as metal concentrations although arsenic is a metalloid. Brief273\ndescriptions of the local land use at and around each site were tabulated for the years274\n1900 and 2007 from Ordnance Survey maps of the area.275\nThe Rural survey276\nThe sampling locations for the rural survey are shown in Figure 2. In selecting the277\narea in which to locate sampling sites we wished (i) to avoid the effects of atmospheric278\nmetal deposition in the vicinity of Swansea, giving consideration to the prevailing south279\nand south-westerly wind directions (ii) to avoid the influence of other smaller urban280\nareas around Swansea and (iii) to ensure the soils were derived from the same dominant281\nparent material types that are found around Swansea (the Penant Sandstone Formation282\nand glacial till).283\nWe selected an area approximately 25 km to the west of Swansea where these284\nconditions were met; this area is also 2 km downwind of the coast, ensuring minimal285\natmospheric sources of metal. We chose to sample the soil at 23 sites; 15 sites over286\nsandstone parent material and eight sites over areas where glacial till had been mapped287\n12\n(British Geological Survey, 2006). The precise sampling locations were randomly se-288\nlected although limitations in access to sites due to crops and livestock were taken into289\naccount. The soil samples were collected in January 2007. At each sampling site, five290\nincremental soil samples were collected using a Dutch auger at the corners and centre291\nof a square with a side of length 20 m and combined to form a composite sample of292\napproximately 0.5 kg. At each of these five points, any surface litter was removed and293\nthe soil sampled to a depth of 15 cm into the exposed soil. On return to the laboratory,294\nthe same preparation and analytical protocols were applied to each sample as those295\ndescribed above for the urban survey.296\nStatistical Analysis of Soil Metal Concentrations Around Swansea297\nWe assume that the spatial variation of soil metal concentrations in the urban soil is298\nthe sum of three factors, (i) natural sources of metals (ii) diffuse pollution (iii) point-299\nsource pollution. We attempted to separate these three components of variation. The300\nvariation due to natural sources was modelled from the rural observations. Regression301\nanalyses were conducted on the rural observations to evaluate the relationships between302\nthe four metals of interest and the total iron concentration as suggested by Hamon et303\nal. (2004). Also, the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the rural304\niron observations was compared with the corresponding CDF from the Swansea urban305\nsurvey to determine whether the soil iron concentration has been enriched in Swansea.306\nThe predicted contribution of natural sources to the observed soil metal concen-307\ntrations was subtracted from the total urban observation to leave the observed com-308\nponent due to anthropogenic processes. These anthropogenic observations were highly309\nskewed and therefore the data were log-transformed. The components due to diffuse310\npollution and point-source pollution were separated by robust geostatistical methods.311\nThe approach was broadly similar to that applied by Marchant et al. (2010) when312\nmapping metals across France. Mate\u00b4rn variograms were fitted to the anthropogenic313\nobservations of each metal by the method of moments in conjunction with Matheron\u2019s314\nestimator and the robust estimators suggested by Cressie & Hawkins (1980), Dowd315\n13\n(1984) and Genton (1998). Cross-validation was performed for each fitted variogram316\nand the estimator with \u03b8\u02d8 closest to 0.455 was selected. The observations were then317\nwinsorized according to the algorithm of Hawkins & Cressie (1984) for various values318\nof constant 1.5 < c < 3.0. This algorithm removes both positive and negative outliers.319\nHowever we expect that the majority of outliers will be positive and caused by point320\nsource pollution. Therefore we only remove these positive outliers.321\nThe mean of \u03b8 was calculated for each c and the winsorized observations zc for322\nwhich \u03b8\u00af was closest to 1.0 were assumed to be observations of the diffuse pollution.323\nThe zc observations were predicted across the study region by the BLUP with a global324\nsearch neighbourhood and these predictions were back-transformed to the original units325\nby the exponential transform. We note that this leads to an estimate of the median326\nrather than the mean in the original units. We consider the median to be the more327\nappropriate statistic for a contaminated dataset. The difference between the anthro-328\npogenic observations and the observations of the diffuse pollution were assumed to be329\nthe effect of point-source pollution.330\nWe note that the choice of robust variogram estimator was based upon non-robust331\ncross validation statistics. The \u03b8\u02d8 statistic could have been assessed after the observa-332\ntions had been winsorized but this would lead to an excessive number of computations333\nsince it would require that the winsorizing algorithm was applied for each of the four334\nrobust variograms and a range of c values.335\nResults336\nPrediction of Natural Metal Concentrations337\nTable 1 shows the summary statistics of the rural soil metal concentrations and the338\ncorrelations between these metals and total iron. In each case these correlations are339\nsmall and the p-values for the null hypothesis that the metal concentrations are in-340\ndependent of the total iron content are greater than 0.4. Additionally, the empirical341\nCDFs (Figure 4) demonstrate that iron concentrations are greater throughout the ur-342\nban survey than in the rural survey. Both of these findings indicate that the method of343\n14\nHamon et al. (2004) for determination of the component of the metal concentrations344\ndue to natural sources is not appropriate for this study. Therefore we approximate the345\nnatural concentration of each metal by its median in the rural survey (Table 1).346\nGeostatistical Prediction of Anthropogenic Metal Concentrations347\nThe Matheron and robust variograms fitted to each log-transformed metal are com-348\npared in Figure 5. For the anthropogenic component of each of the metals the cross-349\nvalidation statistics for the Matheron variogram had \u03b8\u02d8 < 0.455 (Table 2) and therefore350\nthe variogram was not valid. In each case \u03b8\u02d8 increased to a value closer to 0.455 when351\na robust estimator was used. The \u03b8\u00af value was greater than 1.0 for each of the robust352\nestimators. However it was possible to select a winsorizing constant 1.5 < c < 3.0 such353\nthat \u03b8\u00af for the winsorized component zc was approximately 1.0. The values of \u03b8\u02d8 for the354\nwinsorized component were in the range 0.4 \u2264 \u03b8\u02d8 \u2264 0.455. Our use of the \u03b8\u02d8 statistic to355\nassess the suitability of the models assumes that the prediction errors are Gaussian. We356\nconfirm that this assumption is reasonable with QQ plots (Figure 6). For the robust357\nvariogram fitted to the uncensored observations the majority of standardized errors lie358\nclose to the x = y line and indicate that it is reasonable to assume that the prediction359\nerrors for the underlying variation are Gaussian. A number of prediction errors deviate360\nfrom the x = y line at both extremes of the distribution. However by censoring only361\nthe positive outliers all these errors move closer to the x = y line. This indicates that362\nthe negative outliers are artefacts. They are located close to positive outliers and are363\nonly outliers relative to these observations. After winsoring all of the prediction errors364\nfor copper and arsenic are close to the x = y line. For lead and tin it appears that the365\nwinsorizing process has removed too much of the observation. The predicted maps of366\nthe metal concentrations because of diffuse pollution (the censored observations) and367\nthe observations of the point-source pollution (the difference between the observations368\nand the censored observations) are shown in Figure 7.369\nDistribution and magnitude of point and diffuse metal pollution370\n15\nThere are some common features in the maps of diffuse pollution of each metal. In each,371\nthe long-axis of the areas with elevated concentrations is consistent with the prevailing372\nwind direction (oriented approximately 225\u25e6 clockwise from north). Diffuse pollution373\nis elevated on the western side of the Swansea Valley and within the wider Neath374\nValley. Less pollution is evident on the western edge of the study region. The lead and375\ntin diffuse pollution is concentrated into a few localized regions whereas larger areas of376\nelevated copper and arsenic diffuse pollution are evident. The pattern of arsenic diffuse377\npollution is dominated by one large area to the south-east of the Swansea Valley.378\nOf the four metals, copper has the most sites at which point-source pollution is379\nevident. Local details from Ordnance Survey maps of recent (2007) and historic (1900)380\nland use at the sites affected by point-source pollution are presented in Table 3. Land381\nuse at or around the vast majority of these sites is associated with either production382\n(works), transport (railways and docks) or potential disposal (collieries and quarries) of383\nindustrial wastes. At two sites where large concentrations of lead were reported (2768384\nand 3942 mg kg \u22121) the land use information does not indicate any local source for385\nthe metal; the latter site was recorded as a domestic garden during the survey which386\ncould be of some concern given the potential implications for human health through387\nexposure to lead in the soil.388\nDiscussion389\nThe survey confirms that the soils around Swansea remain substantially contaminated390\nby historic metal and metalloid pollution. The soil metal concentrations cannot be391\nrepresented by conventional geostatistical methods because the combination of diffuse392\nand point-source pollution leads to complex patterns of variation. When conventional393\nmodels were fitted to the data they were found to be invalid. The estimated variances394\nwere inflated by a small number of large observations at former industrial sites and395\nthus it was not possible to accurately quantify the uncertainty of the predictions which396\nresult. However, plausible models did result when the diffuse and point-source pollution397\nwere mapped separately by robust geostatistical methods. In a previous survey, robust398\n16\nmethods were also required to map diffuse metal pollution around Sheffield (Rawlins399\net al., 2005) and it is likely that that similar methods will be required to assess metal400\ncontamination in other industrial regions.401\nIt was not possible to map the variation of the natural metal content of the402\nsoil. A relationship between natural metal concentrations and total iron in the soil403\nsuggested by Hamon et al. (2004) does not apply in this study region. However404\nsince the variation of metals from natural sources in this survey was dwarfed by the405\nanthropogenic contribution it was adequate to assume that the natural concentration406\nof each metal was constant across the study region and approximate it by the median407\nconcentration in a nearby uncontaminated rural area.408\nDocumentary evidence suggests that the majority of the diffuse metal pollution409\nacross Swansea was the result of atmospheric deposition of metals to the soil following410\ntheir dispersal from smelter stacks (Hughes, 2000). The patterns of diffuse pollution411\nare consistent with emissions from numerous smelters located throughout the urban412\nareas. The patterns are influenced by the topography of the region and the prevailing413\nwind direction. The spatial predictions could potentially be improved if these factors414\nare included in a process model of deposition following atmospheric dispersal from415\nspecific sources across the region.416\nThe model used in this study assumed a constant mean across the study region.417\nOnce the winsorizing had been completed a LMM including fixed effects could have418\nbeen fitted to the censored observations. We did test models where elevation and parent419\nmaterial were included as fixed effects. However modified likelihood tests (Marchant et420\nal., 2009) suggested that these did not lead to a significantly improved fit. We suggest421\nthat elevation is not a suitable fixed effect because the amount of contamination differs422\non each side of the valleys and that the proximity of a source of contamination is a more423\nimportant factor than the parent material. Anisotropy could also have been added to424\nthe model at this stage.425\nThe pattern of sites where point-source pollution was identified is consistent with426\n17\nmetal production, transport and disposal occurring at numerous sites across the urban427\narea. We note that the robust algorithm identifies local outliers as well as global428\noutliers. Local outliers are not necessarily extreme in comparison with the whole429\ndataset but are extreme in comparison to neighbouring observations. For example430\none copper observation has been identified as an outlier despite the concentration only431\nbeing 100 mg kg\u22121. This is because there was a second observation from the same432\nsite of 40 mg kg\u22121. Such outliers would not be found by algorithms based upon the433\nempirical data distribution (Reimann et al., 2005).434\nThere were some differences between the soil contamination observed in Swansea435\nand that previously observed in Sheffield (Rawlins et al. 2005). Elevated concentrations436\nof total iron were observed throughout urban Swansea but not urban Sheffield. We437\nhypothesise that the difference between the situations in Swansea and Sheffield are438\nbecause Sheffield was a centre of metal processing whereas Swansea was a centre of439\nmetal smelting. Therefore more ferrous waste was brought into Swansea within the440\nmetal ores. Also, the median concentration of lead in topsoil from diffuse pollution in441\nthe survey of Swansea (180 mg kg\u22121) was substantially larger than the value of 73 mg442\nkg\u22121 (urban median of 161 mg kg\u22121 minus rural median of 88 mg kg\u22121) reported by443\nRawlins et al. (2005) in Sheffield. These estimates are comparable because in each444\ncase statistical outliers or hotspots in the urban area were removed from the data.445\nWe believe that the substantially larger concentrations of lead across Swansea \u2013 in446\ncomparison to Sheffield \u2013 result from atmospherically deposited metal due to smelting447\nof metal ores within the urban area of Swansea.448\nIn England and Wales the first tier of a human health or ecological risk assess-449\nment is a comparison between observed total soil metal concentrations at a site and450\ntheir guideline values (Environment Agency, 2009) or screening values (Environment451\nAgency, 2008). In the case of human health risk assessment, the revised Soil Guideline452\nValues for arsenic concentrations in topsoil (32 mg kg \u22121 for residential land use) is453\nexceeded by the predicted sum of natural content and diffuse pollution for 89% of the454\n18\nstudy area. Ecological health risks are assessed according to the difference between455\nobserved concentrations and ambient background metal concentrations (ABC) in soil.456\nThe proposed screening values for lead (167 mg kg \u22121) and copper (88 mg kg \u22121) are457\nexceeded by the predictions of diffuse pollution for 44% and 58% of the study area458\nrespectively. When the ABCs are established it is important to ensure that they do459\nnot include any diffuse metal pollution.460\nExposure to soil Pb can also occur through inhalation of airborne particulates.461\nAverage monthly Pb concentrations (ng m\u22123) of fine (PM10), particulates measured462\nduring 2008 in air from sites in Swansea (Swansea Coedgwilym \u2013 8) and another in463\nPort Talbot (Port Talbot Margam \u2013 11.9) were below the average of 16 ng m\u22123 from464\nall 24 sites in the UK Heavy Metals Monitoring Network (see Brown et al., 2010).465\nAnother site in Swansea (Morriston) had annual average concentrations of particulate466\nPb in air of 20.5 ng m\u22123, somewhat greater than the national average. Although there467\nis some evidence that the enhanced concentrations of topsoil Pb concentrations across468\nSwansea may enhance its concentration in airborne particulates, the overall relationship469\nis complex and requires further study.470\nConclusions471\nThis study illustrates that when soil properties are mapped it is vital to validate the472\nstatistical model of the property to ensure that it is appropriate. Conventional geo-473\nstatistical models were not appropriate for the prediction of diffuse soil metal contam-474\nination across urban Swansea because the estimated variograms and predictions were475\noverly influenced by point source pollution. However these different components of con-476\ntamination were separated and mapped by robust geostatistical methods. The large477\nconcentrations of tin, lead, copper and arsenic in topsoil across the urban Swansea area478\nhave significant implications for human health and ecological risk assessments accord-479\ning to current guidance for England and Wales. The methods described in this paper480\nare likely to be required to map soil pollution around other industrial centres.481\n19\nAcknowledgements482\nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British483\nGeological Survey (Natural Environment Research Council).
