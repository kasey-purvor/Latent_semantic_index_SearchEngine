Glycerol- and olive oil-grown cells present\ndifferent macromolecular composition, particularly lipid and protein content.\nConclusions: Streptomyces clavuligerus uses olive oil as the sole carbon and\nenergy source for growth and clavulanic acid production. Yields and production\nrates in olive oil are comparable to those reported for oil-containing complex\nmedia. Differences in yields and in the macromolecular composition\nindicate that different metabolic pathways convert substrate into product.\nSignificance and impact of the study: This is the first report of oils being used\nas the sole carbon source by Strep. clavuligerus. Apart from economic benefits,\ninteresting questions are raised about Strep. clavuligerus physiology. Defined\nculture media allow physiological studies to be performed in the absence of\ninterference by other compounds. Understanding how Strep. clavuligerus catabolises\noils may have an economic impact in clavulanic acid production.\nKeywords:  Clavulanic acid; Olive oil; glycerol; Streptomyces clavuligerus; lipids; \nmacromolecular composition; carbon source\n3\n1. Introduction\nStreptomyces clavuligerus synthesises clavulanic acid, a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor that \nprevents the development of resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics by pathogenic \nbacteria.  Although the actinomycetes catabolise a wide variety of sugars, S. \nclavuligerus is not able to utilize simple carbohydrates such as glucose and other \nhexoses, pentoses, deoxysugars, sugaralcohols or disaccharides as a result of an \nimpaired glucose uptake mechanism (Garcia-Dominguez et al., 1989).  Thus, several \ntypical industrial culture medium components, such as starch and other \ncarbohydrates, are not viable for the synthesis of clavulanic acid in S. clavuligerus. \nApart from the evident commercial importance, this metabolic anomaly raises \ninteresting questions regarding the physiology of the species.  \nA commonly used carbon source for the synthesis of clavulanic acid in S. \nclavuligerus is glycerol, with arginine generally used as a nitrogen source \n(Aharonowitz and Demain, 1978; Mayer and Deckwer, 1996; Chen et al., 2003; \nTeodoro et al., 2006).  The utilization of glycerol by S. clavuligerus raises the \npossibility that these bacteria could also metabolize triglycerides, in the form of food-\nbased oils, as these can be broken down by lipases to their glycerol and fatty acid \ncomponents.  The utilization of oils is important for the microbial production of \nsecondary metabolites due to their stimulation of bacterial growth and product \nsynthesis, anti-foaming properties, and also to their higher energy content as \ncompared to carbohydrates on a weight by weight basis (Cavanagh et al., 1994; \nLarge et al., 1998), but only a few studies have focused on the use of oils as a \ncarbon and energy source for antibiotic production by S. clavuligerus.  In general, \nthese investigations have used oils in supplementation to other carbon sources, while \n4\nalso using complex culture media containing other substrates such as flour, peptones \nand protein hydrolysates (Lee and Ho, 1996; Large et al., 1998; Hamedi et al., 2002; \nPeacock et al., 2003; Choi and Cho, 2004; Maranesi et al., 2005; Ortiz et al., 2007).  \nThe use of simple, chemically defined media generally facilitates the \ninvestigation of the physiology and biochemistry of secondary metabolite production \nby a microorganism.  In this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the use of \ncommercially available food oils as sole carbon sources supporting clavulanic acid \nproduction and bacterial growth in S. clavuligerus cultures.  Our analysis shows that \nthe levels of clavulanic acid production reached with olive oil are as high as with \nglycerol, the most commonly used carbon source, and antibiotic yields are \ncomparable to those reported for complex culture media.  \n5\n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Strain. The strain used was S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064 NRRL 35851.  \n2.2 Culture media. Cultures were performed using the following media:\n- SV2 medium, containing (per l): Glycerol, 15 g; Glucose, 15 g; Soya peptone, 15 g; \nCaCO3, 1 g.  The pH was adjusted to 7 and the media autoclaved at 121\u00b0C for 15 \nmin. \n- Chemically defined P-limited medium, containing (per l): NH4Cl, 7 g; KH2PO4, 0.25 \ng; MOPS, 21 g. The pH was adjusted to pH 6.8 and the medium autoclaved at 121\u00b0C \nfor 15 min.  After sterilization, trace elements were added to the medium (10 ml l-1). \nThe trace elements stock solution contained (per l): MgSO4.7H20, 25 g; \nFeSO4.7H2O, 2.5 g; CoCl, 0.055 g; CuCl2 0.053 g, CaCl2.2H2O, 1.38 g; ZnCl2, 1.04 g; \nMnCl2, 0.62 g; Na2MoO4, 0.03 g (Bushell et al., 2006). \nGlycerol (0.6% v\/v) was added the P-limited medium before sterilization, while in the \noil-containing experiments 0.6% (v\/v) of oil was added to the autoclaved medium by \nsterile filtration through 0.2 \u03bcm hydrophobic Minisart SRP25 filters (Sartorius, U.K.).\n2.2. Inoculum preparation. A spore suspension (1 ml; stored at -80\u00b0C) was added \nto a 250 ml baffled flask containing 50 ml of SV2 medium and incubated at 135 rpm \nfor 24 h at 30\u00b0C.  500 \u03bcl of this culture were added to 25 ml P-limited medium, \ncontaining 0.6% glycerol, and incubated for 48 h under the same conditions.  This \ntwo-step pre-culture method ensured minimal carry over of rich nutrients in the \nproduction flasks.  The inoculum reached approximately OD600nm = 1.0.  All cultures \n6\nwere regularly examined by microscopy for disperse growth and contamination. \n2.3. Shake flask cultures. 2.5 ml of the pre-culture mentioned above were added to \nflasks with 50 ml P-limited medium containing either 0.6% glycerol or 0.6% oil (v\/v; \nsunflower, soybean, flaxseed, rapeseed or olive oil).  The flasks were incubated as \nabove for 216 h and 1 ml samples were taken every 24 h.  All cultures were \nperformed in triplicate.\n2.4. Bioreactor batch cultures. 1.6 l P-limited medium (containing 0.6% (v\/v) olive \noil or glycerol) was inoculated (5% v\/v) with medium from the shake flask cultures in \na 2 l bioreactor (Adaptive Biosystems, U.K.).  Temperature was maintained at 30\u00b0C, \npH at 6.8, agitation rate at 800 rpm and aeration rate at 0.23 l min-1.  Cultures were \nincubated for 96 h and samples were collected every 12 h.\n2.5. Analytical techniques\n2.5.1.  Biomass.  In  shake  flask  experiments,  1  ml  samples  were  placed  in  pre-\nweighted microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 16000xg for 10 min.  Pellets from the \noil-containing  cultures  were  washed  twice  with  distilled  water  to  remove  lipid \nremnant.  In  the  bioreactor  cultures,  the  biomass  dry  weight  was  determined  by \nfiltering  5  ml  samples  through  0.45  \u03bcm  pre-dried,  pre-weighed  nitrocellulose \nmembranes (Millipore, U.K.),  rinsing three times with  reverse osmosis water,  and \nmicrowaving twice at 650 W for 5 min (Bushell et al., 2006). The membranes were \nallowed to cool in a desiccator and the weight determined. In cases where a  rapid \nestimation of  growth  was required,  pellets  were  re-suspended in  1  ml  of  distilled \n7\nwater  and  the  optical  density  (600  nm)  of  the  suspension  recorded.  Due  to  the \nfilamentous growth showed by the microorganism, these measurements were used \nonly  as  rough  estimations,  and  were  always  followed  by  biomass  dry  weight \ndeterminations.\n2.5.2. Clavulanic acid. Clavulanic acid was measured according to the method of \nBird et al. (1982) that involves the reaction of clavulanic acid with imidazole (at 30\u00b0C \nfor 12 min) followed by spectrophotometric measurement of the resulting conjugate \nat 312 nm. \n2.5.3. Macromolecular composition of bacterial biomass. Biomass pellets were \nwashed twice with chilled distilled water and freeze-dried overnight.  Total protein \nwas measured following the method described by Hartree (1972); total lipids were \ndetermined as described by Izard and Limberger (2003); glycogen was determined \nfollowing the method described by Parrou and Francois (1997); total carbohydrate \nwas measured as described by Dubois et al. (1956). \n2.5.4. Triglycerides, glycerol and unesterified fatty acids. Triglycerides were \nmeasured after treatment of the culture supernatant samples with lipase and \nesterase (100 U ml-1; at 37\u00baC for 2 h) and measurement of the glycerol produced.  A \nglycerol assay kit (Megazyme, Ireland) was used for determining glycerol. \nUnesterified fatty acid levels were determined with a Free Fatty Acids Half-Micro Test \nKit (Roche, Germany). \n8\n9\n3. Results\n3.1. Oils support bacterial growth and clavulanic acid production. The ability of \nS. clavuligerus to grow and produce clavulanic acid in different oil-containing media \nwas tested in exploratory shake-flask cultures and compared to media with glycerol \nas the carbon source.  Only two out of five tested oils supported good production of \nclavulanic acid.  The highest clavulanic acid concentration was observed in medium \ncontaining olive oil, which yielded 47 mg l-1 of clavulanic acid, nearly 2-fold higher \nthan the clavulanic acid concentration measured in the glycerol medium, namely 25 \nmg l-1 (Fig. 1).  Culture medium containing sunflower oil produced 18 mg l-1, whereas \nmedia containing soybean, flaxseed or rapeseed oil did not support clavulanic acid \nproduction at any measurable level (data not shown).  Biomass reached an OD600nm \nof 0.6 in olive oil, sunflower oil and glycerol cultures, but the maximum values were \nreached at different time points with each substrate (at 72 h, 144 h and 48 h, \nrespectively) (Fig. 1).\n3.2. Bioreactor cultures. In bioreactors the kinetics of bacterial growth and \nclavulanic acid production showed similar profiles with glycerol- and olive oil-\ncontaining media (Fig. 2).  The maximum concentration of biomass was reached at \napproximately 80 h, although the maximum level of clavulanic acid production with \nolive oil was delayed by approximately 10 h as compared to glycerol.  Glycerol was \ndepleted by 96 h in the control culture, but in the olive oil culture only 2.4 g l-1 of \ntriglycerides (~25%) was consumed over 96 h, remaining constant thereafter (Fig. 2). \nBiomass and clavulanic acid yields (product per substrate, g.g-1) were 2.5- and \n2.6-fold higher, respectively, with olive oil than with glycerol (Table 1).  To account for \n10\nthe different carbon content of the substrates yields have also been expressed in \nterms of mol carbon used and produced, with similar trends observed (Table 1). The \nrates of production of biomass and clavulanic acid were calculated by curve fitting. \nThe maximum calculated biomass production rates were 61 \u00b1 0.3 mg l-1 h-1 for \nglycerol and 58 \u00b1 0.4 mg l-1 h-1 for olive oil, both observed at 60 h of culture. The \nmaximum specific growth rates calculated were 0.06 h-1 in both media. The \ncalculated clavulanic acid production rates were 3.7 \u00b1 0.47 mg l-1 h-1 for glycerol and \n1.4 \u00b1 0.20 mg l-1 h-1 for olive oil, observed at 73 h. The maximum specific production \nrates of the antibiotic were calculated as 1.5 mg g-1 h-1 and 0.7 mg g-1 h-1 for glycerol \nand olive oil, respectively.\n3.3. Changes in macromolecular composition of the bacteria. The \nmacromolecular composition of S. clavuligerus incubated with glycerol as the carbon \nsource differs from that of cells incubated with olive oil (Table 2).  At 48 h the \ncarbohydrate content was higher in the glycerol grown cells, but at 72 and 96 h \nsimilar values were observed in both media.  In contrast, cellular lipids show much \nhigher levels in olive oil-containing medium at 48 and 72 h, compared to the glycerol \nmedium.  Protein concentrations showed a steady increase between 48 and 96 h, \nwith the olive oil cultures showing slightly higher concentration than the glycerol \nculture.  Levels of glycogen remained relatively constant with glycerol, whereas a \nsmall increase is observed with olive oil.\n \n3.4. Unesterifed fatty acids. The changes in growth parameters, clavulanic acid \nproduction and macromolecular composition point to differences in the metabolic \npathways utilised when S. clavuligerus is cultured with either glycerol or olive oil. \n11\nDecreases in olive oil levels in the supernatant (Fig. 2), indicate that this substrate is \nprobably hydrolysed by extracellular lipases, releasing glycerol and unesterified fatty \nacids as potential carbon sources.  In the glycerol cultures no fatty acids were \ndetected, whereas in the olive oil cultures the levels of unesterified fatty acids were \nlow at less than 80 mg l-1, but still higher than levels in the medium of the glycerol \ngrown cells (Fig. 2).  \n12\n4. Discussion\n In this study we clearly demonstrate that  S. clavuligerus can utilise olive oil  as a \ncarbon source with  clavulanic acid yields and growth parameters similar  to those \nobtained with glycerol (Fig. 1; Table 1). To our knowledge this is the first study to use \na food-based oil as a sole carbon source for the production of clavulanic acid in S. \nclavuligerus and this  finding  is  potentially  of  major  economic  significance for  the \npharmaceutical  industry,  as  vegetable  oils  are  much  cheaper  than  carbohydrate \nsubstrates (Large et al., 1998). Though previous studies have demonstrated that oils, \nincluding olive oil,  can be used for antibiotic production in bacteria, these studies \nhave consistently used complex culture media containing other carbon sources (Lee \nand Ho, 1996; Large et al., 1998; Hamedi et al., 2002; Peacock et al., 2003; Choi and \nCho,  2004;  Maranesi  et  al., 2005; Ortiz  et  al.,  2007).  Even though the fatty acid \ncomposition of olive oil changes within a certain range, the oil can be considered a \nchemically defined component. \nOne of the most important parameters to assess the suitability of a culture \nmedium is the product yield.  As product yields are dependent on the metabolic \npathways involved in the conversion of substrate into product (Westerhof and \nKholodenko, 2004), different values are to be expected when diverse carbon sources \nare used. Interestingly, almost 75% of the olive oil initially added to the medium \nremained after 24 h, which is consistent with a medium not limited in the carbon \nsource.  The clavulanic acid yields in this study (Table 1) are in agreement with \nprevious work using oils in complex culture media (Large et al., 1998; Ortiz et al., \n2007), even though the yields due to oils in these studies are probably an over-\nestimation due to the presence of other carbon sources.  The high biomass yield \n13\nobserved with olive oil is in accordance with the yields observed in other studies \nusing substrates with a high degree of reduction, such as hydrocarbons (Roels, \n1983; von Stockar et al., 2006).  We hypothesize that the triglycerides in olive oil are \nhydrolyzed by lipases produced  by the bacteria (both extracellular and membrane \nbound lipases have been reported for Streptomyces; Large et al. 1999; Valdez et al. \n1999), to release glycerol and unesterified fatty acids into the culture medium that \ncan then be taken up by the bacteria.  The slight delay in growth observed with the \ncells grown in olive oil (Fig. 1) hints at an adaptive process, e.g. to increase lipase \nproduction.  \nGlycerol can be used as a substrate in the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis \npathways, whereas fatty acids, which are more energy-dense than glycerol (per gram \nof substrate), are utilised in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway.  Streptomyces have been \npreviously shown to use fatty acids as an energy source through intracellular \nhydrolysis by the \u03b2-oxidation pathway (Banchio and Gramajo, 1997).  Interestingly, \nthe observation that cells grown in olive oil have a higher lipid content than the \nglycerol grown cells (48 h) (Table 2), in combination with the decrease in triglyceride \nlevels in the culture medium (Fig. 2), indicate that the fatty acids from olive oil have \nbeen taken up by the bacteria, a suggestion also supported by the low levels of \nunesterified fatty acids measured in the culture medium (Fig.2).  The subsequent \ndecrease of the cellular lipid levels at 72 and 96 h of culture suggests that the fatty \nacids are metabolised by the cells.  The rapid initial increase in lipid content of \nbacteria grown in olive oil, as compared to glycerol (Table 2), implies that adaptation \nto lipid uptake is faster than for fatty acid utilization.  The lipid content of olive oil \ngrown cells (Table 2) is similar to that found in Streptomyces lividans grown in triolein \n14\n(Peacock et al., 2003), while the macromolecular composition values observed here \nare in accordance to those found in studies with S. clavuligerus and related genera \n(Davidson, 1992; Shabab et al., 1996; Roubos, 2002; Jacques, 2004). \nIn conclusion, our results show that S. clavuligerus is able to grow and produce \nclavulanic acid in media containing olive oil as the sole carbon and energy source. \nEven though the clavulanic acid concentrations reached were lower than those \nnormally desirable in industrial processes, the antibiotic yields and production rates \nare comparable to those observed previously in studies using oils in combination with \ncomplex media.  The use of oils has a potential economic benefit for production of \nantibiotics in large-scale bioprocesses, if media are supplemented with the adequate \nnitrogen sources. The use of defined media has the additional benefit that \nphysiological studies can be performed in the absence of interference by other \ncompounds.\nAcknowledgements.
