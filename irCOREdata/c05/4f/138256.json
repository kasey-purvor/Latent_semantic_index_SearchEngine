However, although a great deal of research has been\ncarried out on business consultancy, little has been written on business consultancy\nfrom the consultant\u2019s viewpoint. In order to gain a detailed view of the situation from\nan internal consultant\u2019s perspective, an investigation of how business consultants\nperceive their role and contribution within their clients\u2019 organisations was undertaken.\nDrawing on different perspectives, this study aims to demystify the role of business\nconsultants, and to ascertain how they perceive their role within their clients\u2019\norganisations.\nDesign\/Methodology\/Approach \u2013 A series of interviews were conducted, where\nbusiness consultants were asked to comment on issues related to the nature of the\nrelationship with their clients, the pros and cons of their role and also the amount of\ncontrol and discretion they exercise over the different projects that they are engaged\nin. Interview data from 17 business consultants from a variety of fields such as change\nmanagement, information technology, corporate finance and human resource are\nanalysed using an interpretive frame.\nFindings - The research findings reveal that differences exist between the rather\npejorative conclusions of previous research and the conclusions of this study.\nWhereas previous research highlighted the omnipotence and the more or less\ndeontological practice of consultants, the data analysis from this study concludes that\nbusiness consultants appear very humble in their approach to their relationship with\nclients, and believe that moving clients forward is their ultimate goal. The findings\nalso enable us to demonstrate that business consultants are conscious of the amount of\ncontrol and discretion that is passed on to them by clients, and do recognise that\ncriticisms of their role can be at times justified.\nOriginality\/Value - The monograph has value for both consultants and clients. The\nrole determinants model presented in the study highlights the main characteristics of\nthe role of business consultants and helps both clients and consultants to rethink their\napproach to the consulting process\n3Keywords - Management consultancy, organisational learning, skills transfer, role\ndeterminants, qualitative research\nPaper type - Monograph\n4INTRODUCTION\nThe publications of government spending on management consultancy has increased\nthe levels of mistrust and doubt about the efficiency and reliability of consultants\u2019\nexpertise (De Burgundy, 1998: 204). It appears that business consultants are a much\nmaligned group and their efficiency is regularly questioned by clients and academics\nalike. The appearance of anaphors and metaphors suggesting that business consultants\nare people \u2018who would borrow your watch to tell you what time it is\u2019 (Lindon, 1995:\n23) has incited consideration of several issues; are the criticisms of the role of\nconsultants justified?, do clients have to assume part of the responsibility in project\nfailures? An investigation of how business consultants perceive their role and\ncontribution within their clients organisations was undertook in order to gain a\ndetailed view of the situation from an internal consultant perspective.\nThe first section of this monograph consists of an overview of business consultancy\nwritings and most relevant studies. Results of studies investigating the role of\nbusiness consultants, the relationship between consultants and clients and the main\narguments against business consultancy are presented. The second section highlights\nthe approach and the motivations underpinning this study. The review of the\nliterature has led to the identification of a gap, this one will be presented. Prior to\npresenting the study results, the methodology section presents the study approach and\nhighlights the data collection and data analysis processes. Finally, the study results\nsection gives an insightful view on how business consultants perceive their role in\nterms of their relationship with clients, level of control and discretion, and pros and\ncons of their role. The conclusion discusses the study results in perspective of the\nliterature reviewed in the second section; a model on business consultants role\ndeterminants will be presented and recommendations aiming at assisting consultants\nto rethink their approach to the consulting process will be made.\n5CONSULTANCY: AN OVERVIEW\nFour different sections will compose this overview. The first part of our analysis deals\nwith exploring the role of business consultants. Secondly, an in-depth analysis of the\nliterature intends to provide a clear understanding of the relationship existing between\nconsultants and clients. It will be demonstrated in this particular section that business\nconsultants, if willing to deliver a satisfactory level of service, are required to use a\nwide range of skills corresponding to the different roles involved in the consultancy\nprocess. The third part aims to highlight the most virulent criticisms of business\nconsultants and contrast them with the main arguments in favour of the field. Finally,\na theoretical framework on the role theory will be used to ascertain how business\nconsultants may perceive their own role and contribution.\nDefinition\nThroughout this study, the notion of business consultancy will be referred to on a\nregular basis and it seems judicious at this point to define this concept and agree on\nwhat business consultancy actually is. The boundaries between business consultancy\nand other \u201ccustomer-related\u201d practices such as mentoring, counselling or coaching\nappear unclear. It will be demonstrated at a later point that consultants themselves\nagree on saying that sometimes their role within the client\u2019s organisation is unclear.\nWe argue that business consultancy has been hoisted with its own petard and that the\nconfusion towards the role of business consultants is actually the result of their own\nsuccess. As suggested by McLarty and Robinson (1998: 256), the past decade has\nseen \u2018an extraordinary expansion in management consultancy\u2019, but it is important\nthat business consultancy is distinguished from \u201cservice providers\u201d practices who\nproclaim themselves to be consultants.\nMentoring is often assimilated to consultancy. This concept is defined by Brown\n(1990: 18) as a process in which \u2018an experienced veteran helps to shape or guide a\nnewcomer\u2019. Other academics adopt a rather more pragmatic view of mentoring in\nassuming that a mentor is someone \u2018who helps another person become what the\nperson aspires to\u2019 (Gladstone, 1988: 1). The literature suggests that mentorship is the\nrelationship existing between a mentor and his \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9\u201d where the former, via\n6sharing his experiences, acts as a guide to the newcomer in the organisation. Although\nthere are similar characteristics between mentorship and business consultancy, the\nformer involves the idea of promotion and upward mobility that is lacking in the\nconcept of business consultancy (Appelbaum et al, 1994: 6).\nCounselling is another practice often misunderstood and likened to the process of\nconsultancy. Carroll, (1995: 26) confirms that both practices are different when noting\nthat \u2018counsellors are not usually management consultants, and not usually in a strong\nposition to assess the well-being of an organisation and its effects on its employees\u2019.\nOne could argue that the main differentiator between counselling and consulting\nstands in the fact that counselling involves a more interpretive rather than analytic\napproach. Hannabuss (1997) confirms this assumption and points out the\npsychological dimension underpinning the role of counsellors; \u2018counselling sets out to\ndiscover this inner world and help the client interpret unconscious thoughts, feelings\nand images\u2019 (Hannabuss, 1997: 375). Although, it will be demonstrated later on that\nbusiness consultants at some point do need to adopt a reflective approach, it can not\nbe considered as a core element of their role. The boundary between consulting and\ncoaching also appears blurred. Although it can be argued that coaching is in fact part\nof the consulting process, coaching involves a more emotional and relational approach\nthan consulting, which mainly deals with analysing and solving complex issues.\nLenhardt, (2004: xv) suggests that coaching aims at \u2018instigating in each individual an\nintuitive and relational aptitude to the development of self-esteem, ontological and\nrelational security, the capacity to listen and the capacity to take charge of oneself\u2019.\nIt is generally accepted that business consultancy first appeared at the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, when Frederic Tailor first published his treatise on Scientific\nManagement in 1911 (Massey, 2003: 304; Pellegrinelli, 2002: 343). Business\nconsultancy due to its numerous forms is a difficult process to define. However, the\nInstitute of Management Consultancy (IMC) tried to agree on an \u201cofficial\u201d definition\nof business\/management consultancy. According to this institution, \u2018management\nconsultancy is the service provided to business, public and the other undertakings by\nan independent and qualified person\u2019 (IMC cited in McLarty and Robinson, 1998:\n256). Although \u201cofficial\u201d, this definition does not refer to the role played by\nbusiness\/management consultants. Greiner and Metzger\u2019s definition (1983: 7) brings\n7us a step forward and allows us to clearly understand what business consultancy is\nabout. They define business consultancy as \u2018an advisory service contracted for and\nprovided to organisations by specially trained and qualified persons who assist, in an\nobjective and independent manner, the client organisation to identify management\nproblems, analyse such problems, recommend solutions to these problems and help\nwhen requested in the implementation of solutions\u2019. If we carefully study Greiner and\nMetzger\u2019s (1983) definition, a number of points are worth mentioning. According to\nthem, business consultancy requires specific skills and a specific level of knowledge\nin order to help clients identify the problems encountered.\nBusiness consultancy is about acquiring and sharing knowledge. Berry and Oakley\n(1993) share this view and refer to the \u201cknowledge industry\u201d when talking about\nbusiness consultancy. They introduced the notion of praxis, defined as the \u2018task of the\nfusion of theory and action in the continuing experience of working on serious\nproblems\u2019 (Berry and Oakley, 1993: 12). According to them, this function of praxis\ncharacterises the role of business consultants and acts as \u2018a bridge and a structure to\nknowledge creation and knowledge application\u2019 (Berry and Oakley, 1993: 13). Clark\nand Salaman (1998) suggest that business consultancy appears as an \u2018intangible and\ndifficult service to define\u2019 (Clark and Salaman, 1998 in Pellegrinelli, 2002: 347) and\nif one is willing to understand the role of business consultants, the entire consultancy\nprocess and not only bribes must be analysed.\nROLE OF BUSINESS CONSULTANTS\nThe role of business consultants and the nature of the services they offer is complex\nand indistinct. Throughout this section, the study intends to provide an answer to the\nquestion that has engendered such a polemic: what is the role of business consultants?\nThe Different Roles of Business Consultants\nThere is a profusion of information exploring the role of business consultants, but the\nquestion of why companies employ the services of external professionals must firstly\nbe tackled. Pellegrinelli (2002: 343) as well as Massey (2003) notes that it is\ncurrently common practice for top-level managers to employ the services of business\n8consultants to assist their organisations in selecting \u2018the appropriate strategies from\nthe plethora of available choices\u2019 (Massey, 2003: 304).\nOrganisational Uncertainty\nIt appears from the literature that managers\u2019 uncertainty towards the fast changing\nenvironment is a core element of the demand for consulting services. Arnaud (1998:\n469) suggests that consultancy begins when an organisation decider \u2018expresses a\n\u201cclient-request\u201d before a professional\u2019. According to Arnaud (1998), this request\n\u2018reveals an awareness, more or less vague, of the existence of an organisational\nsituation needing change\u2019 and justifying the intervention of a professional. This idea\nis supported by Wittreich (1966: 130) who notes that \u2018often a client who wishes to\npurchase a professional service senses that he has a problem, but is uncertain as to\nwhat the specific nature of his problem really is\u2019. This feeling of uncertainty is\nconsidered by Blunsdon (2002) to be the root of the demand for consulting services.\nHe suggests that \u2018the consultancy industry exists because of the presence of persistent\norganisational and management problems which creates an atmosphere of uncertainty\nand exerts pressure on managers to be seen to be acting both rationally and\ninnovatively\u2019 (Blunsdon, 2002: 5). Sturdy (1997) argues that the very first role of\nbusiness consultants is to provide clients with a reassuring sense of control aiming to\nreduce the uncertainty existing within the organisation. In that sense, one could\ncompare business consultants to therapists who would help managers to be relieved\nof the anxiety that prevents them from doing their job efficiently.\nMassey (2003: 307) provides us with a useful set of metaphors aiming to better\nunderstand the role of consultants. Three consultants were asked to describe their\nroles through the use of a metaphor; the first one chose to compare his role to that of a\npilot of a ship undertaking a voyage. The second one compared himself to a gardener\ntaking care of an eco-system whereas the third one opted for the role of a guide. This\nillustration demonstrates the subjectivity of the role of business consultants and in fact\nhelps us to realise how difficult it is to conceptualise and define their role.\n9Number of Roles\nThe literature suggests that there are different schools of thought regarding the role of\nbusiness consultants. Some argue that consultants fulfil mainly a single role whereas\nothers such as Lippitt and Lippitt (1986: 57) consider that the consultant \u2018fulfils a\nnumber of roles that he or she judges to be appropriate for the client, the situation, and\nhis or her own style\u2019. Chapman (1998), seems to agree with Lippitt and Lippitt\u2019s\nargument (1986). Indeed, when investigating the skills of business consultants\nworking with non-profit organisations, Chapman (1998: 212) concluded; \u2018consultants\ncan fill a variety of roles depending on the demands of the situation\u2019. Other perceive\nbusiness consultancy as a process in which both clients and consultants benefit and\nequally participate. Massey and Walker (1999: 38) assume that \u2018if the consultant\nselects appropriate roles that are aligned with client expectations, no matter how this\nprocess is managed, then the assignment is more likely to be successful in achieving\nthe agreed goal\u2019.\nSome academics who have been trying to identify the role of business consultants\nidentified a list of functions and roles played by consultants. Steele\u2019s study (1975) for\ninstance demonstrated how broad the role of consultants is. He identified nine roles\nthat a consultant may adopt when working on a project with a client; teacher, student,\ndetective, barbarian, clock, monitor, talisman, advocate and ritual pig. Others such as\nKubr (1996) identified two basic roles of business consultants, the \u201cresource role\u201d\nhelping clients with their problems by using consultants\u2019 experience and appropriated\nknowledge and the \u201cprocess role\u201d consisting of helping the organisation \u2018to solve its\nproblems by making it aware of organisational process\u2019 (Kubr, 1996: 58).\nThe \u201cProcess Consultation\u201d Model\nThe idea suggesting that consultancy must first been seen in terms of process is\nattributed to Schein (1988, 1999), who provides us with three different models putting\nforward assumptions on the role of business consultants. \u201cProcess consultation\u201d is\npragmatically defined by Schein (1999: 3) as \u2018what goes on between a helper and the\nperson or group being helped\u2019. The first model developed by Schein (1988) is the\nexpert one in which the consultant\u2019s role is to bring alongside with its experience a\n10\nparticular expertise or skill that is currently lacking in the organisation. Although that\nthere has been evidence that consultants see their role more as a coach than that of an\nexpert (Werr et al, 1997: 298), in Schein\u2019s expert model, the consultant acts as an\nexpert telling clients what has to be done to solve their problems. Schein (1988),\nadapted his second model from the relationship existing between a doctor and his\npatient. In this particular scenario the role of the consultant is to prescribe a solution\naiming to alleviate the pain experienced by the client. The process consultation model\nis actually much more than making a diagnosis or solving a problem by way of\nexpertise. Process consultation involves a series of different activities aiming to help\nclients to perceive and to understand their problems in order to solve them by\nthemselves.\nOrganisational Learning\nThe idea of transfer of skills underpins the process consultation model. Williams\n(2004: 184) commenting on Schein\u2019s contribution notes that \u2018the consultant\u2019s role is\ntherefore one of helping the client become a sufficiently competent diagnostician. A\nkey part of the process consultant is that the client must see (i.e. learn about) the\nproblems for themselves as well as generate any solution if they are to have\nownership and take responsibility\u2019. It appears regularly in the literature and it is\nconfirmed by Schein, that clients not only own the problems but also own the\nsolution. The role of the consultant is not the one of only solving problems but one of\nhelping the client to understand what the issues really are. Turner (1988: 12) notes\nthat the role of business consultants has changed over the years and argues that the\nnew role of business consultants is that of facilitating organisational learning; \u2018the\nemphasis of consulting has changed from \u201csolving problems\u201d to building clients\u2019\ncapacity for diagnosing situations on their own and thus managing more\neffectively\u2026increasingly, management consultants are worth their fees not only\nbecause of their ability to analyse client problems and provide sound\nrecommendations, but also because of their skills in conducting a human process that\nfacilitates needed learning and change\u2019. Argyris (1970) identified three pragmatic\nroles of business consultants. According to him, the first role of consultants when\nassigned to work on a project is to obtain valid and relevant information. Their second\nrole brings us back to the beginning of this section and the idea that business\n11\nconsultants must facilitate the choice of options available to managers. Finally, their\nlast role is to make sure that an internal commitment occurs and that everybody within\nthe organisation follow the course of action.\nBusiness consultants, when working on projects with clients, facilitate organisational\nlearning, which appears to be a core element of organisations\u2019 survival currently.\nMany writers stress the importance of learning during the consultation process, Steele\nfor instance (1975: 190) claims that \u2018learning is the essence of the consulting process\u2019.\nBurnes et al (2003: 453) argue that with the constantly changing environment that\nbusinesses operate in nowadays, an organisation would not survive if it failed to learn\nat least as fast as its environment changed. In this respect, one could argue that skills\ntransfer is actually a core element of the role of business consultants.\nOne cannot discuss the importance of organisational learning without mentioning the\ncontribution of Argyris and Sch\u00f6n (1978). These authors suggest that organisational\nlearning occurs when \u2018individuals within an organisation experience a problematic\nsituation and enquire into it on the organisation\u2019s behalf\u2026..that lead them to modify\ntheir images of organisational phenomena and to restructure their activities so as to\nbring outcomes and expectations\u2019 (Argyris and Sch\u00f6n, 1978: 16).\nWerr et al (1997: 298) support the idea that learning is a central element of the\nconsultancy process. Larwood and Gattiker (1986) go even further in suggesting that\nthe role of business consultants is actually to fill the gap between their own body of\nknowledge and that of their clients\u2019. It is argued that there is a link between changes\ntaking place within organisations and the learning capacity of them. This is confirmed\nby Nonaka and Takeouchi (1995) cited in O\u2019Keefe (2002: 132) who suggest that \u2018the\nessence of strategic change lies in developing organisational capability to acquire,\ncreate, accumulate and exploit the knowledge domain\u2019. Thus, if the role of business\nconsultants is actually to bring new skills and knowledge that will be disseminated\nwithin organisations; consultants can therefore be considered as agents of change.\n12\nConsultants as Agents of Change\nIt is argued that faster changes create weaker situations and therefore justify a need\nfor external help. In that sense, the consultant\u2019s role is more than simply reassuring\nmanagers and alleviating feelings of uncertainty, it is also to facilitate organisational\nchange. As noted by Brown and Eisenhard (1998), the best-performing companies,\nvia the domination of the industry, set the pace and rhythm of change, and one can\nargue that the role of consultants is not only to transfer their skills to clients but to\nhelp them to create the change or catch-up with it.\nMcKinley and Scherer (2000) investigated the unanticipated consequences of\nrestructuring in organisations. They hypothesised that there is a relationship between\nthe writings of consultants and organisational restructuring. According to them, the\nwritings of consultants on organisational change drives top-executives to restructure\norganisations, which leads consultants to write even more; thus giving the impression\nof an endless loop.\nTo conclude on this section defining the role of business consultants, the ambiguous\ncharacter of the role of business consultants should be stressed. It has thus far been\nnoted that consultants play different roles, some argue that they are agents of change\nin transferring some of their skills to clients, others argue that throughout the\nconsultation process their role evolves and changes to adapt to clients\u2019 requirements.\nIt will be proved in due course that the business consultant\u2019s role is highly\ncontroversial and subject to many criticisms, however the difficulty of the role played\nby consultants hinges in the fact that everything they do for their clients has to be\ndone in a creative and customised way. It is referred to as the \u201ctranslation process\u201d by\nCrucini and kipping (2001: 584) and consists of adapting the knowledge of business\nconsultants to specific client needs. The necessity of offering customised solutions to\nclients is perceived as a basic requirement by Fullerton and West (1996: 45) who\nsuggest that it is important that \u2018both clients and consultants must find a \u201ctailor-made\u201d\nsolution rather than the consultant simply giving an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d solution\u2019.\nBlunsdon (2002) argues that the problems experienced by managers are well known\nand that therefore the solutions offered by business consultants are always the same.\nOne could therefore argue that the role of business consultants is extremely\n13\nparadoxical, in the sense that business consultants must provide their clients with new\nand creative solutions to problems which are not new and to which solutions are\nknown by everyone.\nTable.1 Role of business consultants: Summary\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nAuthor Focus Relevance to the research\nArgyris and Sch\u00f6n\n(1996)\nConsultants as\nagent of change\nBusiness consultancy is a process through\nwhich organisations learn.

Managerial positions are characterised with a high level\nof stress and uncertainty. It was argued earlier on that the business consultant\u2019s role is\nto help managers to make decisions in transferring some of their skills. It is argued\nthat the role of business consultants is in fact much more than providing help and\nmore or less judicious advice. The relationship existing between consultants and\nclients is much more than professional, and involves a psychological dimension that\nmust be taken into account when exploring the relationship existing between both\nparties.\nEmotional Support Providers\nAccording to a study by Covin and Fisher (1991), investigating the key factors of the\nsuccess or failure of consultancy projects, it appears that the interpersonal fit between\nconsultants and clients is vitally important. Lundberg and Young (2001: 535) who\ninvestigated the role of emotions in the consultant\/client relationship argue that\nconsultants who are called in to provide expertise and solutions on pragmatic\nproblems i.e. organisational change, are in fact implicitly called in to provide\nemotional support.\nThe notion of emotional support comes back on a regular basis in the literature\nalthough Lundberg and Young (2001) noted that there is a feeling of taboo about\nemotions in consultancy, \u2018emotions are neither written nor talked about in\nmanagement and consulting\u2019 (Lundberg and Young, 2001: 535). Stapley (1996)\nshares this view and argues that organisational change is not only about dealing with\nthe change but also about dealing with feelings and emotions of the different members\ninvolved in the process. Schaffer (1997) argues that the fact that conventional\nconsulting ignores the cultural and psychological dimensions of the relationship\nbetween clients and consultants can lead some projects to failure.\n15\nEmotions are usually not associated with business consultancy. A plausible\nexplanation could be the fact that business consultants are seen by other members of\norganisations as the person in charge of the organisational change process and\ntherefore in order to be credible they need to remain professional and doubtless about\nthe solutions they prescribe. Lundberg and Young (2001: 536) observed that business\nconsultants themselves have doubts and uncertainties but \u2018successful consultants need\nto be in touch with and have ways of dealings with their own anxiety, their own\nmoods and affective reasons, so as to feel reasonably alert, secure, comfortable and\ncentred to interact with their clients\u2019. Beeby et al (1998: 61) suggest that \u2018consultancy\nis normally associated with professional and rational approaches; where \u201cobjectivity\u201d\nis the norm and in which content-oriented expertise is marketed to client\norganisations\u2019. It is believed that the way business consultants act and react is adapted\nto clients\u2019 expectations of consultants. Although the relationship between client\nexpectations and the role of business consultants will be explored in the role theory\nsection, it can be argued that the reason why there are so few notes on emotions and\nconsultancy is not because business consultants do not have any emotions but simply\nbecause their role does not allow them to show any.\nWhen defining the concepts and highlighting the differences between consultant and\ncounsellor, it was argued that the role of counsellor involve a much more interpretive\napproach than the role of consultants. One could argue that more than providing\nsolutions and emotional support, consultants have to sometimes adapt themselves to\nthe situation and act as therapists. Johanson, (2003: 347) when exploring the\nrelationship existing between consultants and clients, recalls an interview where the\nconsultant was playing the role of a therapist:\n\u201cConsultant: how do you manage these internal conflicts ? they must take a lot of\nenergy?\u201d\n\u201cClient: yes, but this is really why I want to have you as a sounding board,\nbecause I have no one in our organisation to sit down and talk with\nabout these things\u201d\nIn this particular situation we could argue that there has been a change in both the role\nplayed by the consultant and the purpose of his employment. More than simply being\nthe person in charge of helping the client, the consultant\u2019s role here is to listen to the\n16\nclient and in a way he acts as a container. Arnaud (1998) agrees with this view and\nhighlights the psychological aspect of the relationship between consultants and their\nclients and suggests that \u2018the consultant should make a special note of anything that\napparently has little importance to the actual technical needs expressed, just as the\npsychoanalyst listens to the alleged nonsense formulated by the patient on the couch\u2019\n(Arnaud, 1998: 477).\nAs it is possible to observe the relationship between clients and consultants is much\nmore than a simple professional relationship where the consultant acts as an expert\nand provides a solution to his client. One can argue that to reach a stage where the\nclient calls in the consultant simply to talk, a relationship based on trust must have\nfirst been developed. Chapman (1998: 211) argues that \u2018consultants are engaged in a\nhelping the relationship with the client, rather than simply being a provider of\nexpertise and little more. According to Pellegrinelli (2002: 353) the consultant\u2019s role\nis to firstly establish a sound relationship with the client and attempt to make him feel\n\u2018comfortable with the consultant and the process\u2019 before undertaking any changes\nwithin the client organisation. Lundberg and Young (2001: 537), go a step further and\nassume that \u2018turning emotional distress into positive organisational action, even\nexcitement, after all is what consultants really are all about\u2019.\nThe Importance of Building a Sound Relationship\nThe idea of building a sound relationship prior to any change appears to be generally\naccepted. Stumpf and Longman (2000) for instance observed that \u2018the lack of team\nand institutional relationship success is directly related to the failure of the consultants\nto develop their personal approach to create or connect with team and institutional\nmarketing efforts\u2019 (Stumpf and Longman, 2000: 125). They developed an interesting\nmodel aiming to understand the evolution of the relationship between consultants and\nclients. According to them, there are four different stages in the process of building\nthe relationship; the first one is the \u201cdevelopment stage\u201d aiming to create a \u2018\u201dready-\nreceiver\u201d who will be willing to invest time in conversation with the consultant\u2019. The\nsecond stage enlarges the scope of the relationship and suggests that through\nconversations, a common interest between the consultant and his client is developed.\nThis common interest allows the consultant to gain the respect of his client and\n17\nappears as even more credible. Stumpf and Longman (2000: 125) suggest that the\ncredibility of the client can be gained via a particularly good understanding of the\nclient\u2019s industry or company. The third stage consists of an identification of the real\nand relevant customer needs that will change client\u2019s perception of the consultant.\nStumpf and Longman (2000) implicitly highlight the difficulty of the role of business\nconsultants and note that the progression to the next stage requires a great deal of\npatience and persistence. Arnaud (1998: 472) also investigated the relationship\nexisting between consultants and clients and hypothesised, that in some extreme\ncases, clients feel so lonely and disarmed to face their problems, see their feelings\ntowards consultants change from trust to \u201ctrue love\u201d.\nAs previously demonstrated, one of the main tasks of business consultants is to gather\ndata in order to identify and solve problems. Stumpf and Longman (2000: 129) argue\nthat a client\u2019s willingness to share information depends on the consultant\u2019s ability to\nbuild trust and the emotional depth of the relationship. Since the process of gathering\ndata is the key point of the success of a consultancy project, one can argue that the\nability of a consultant to build trust and gain the credibility of the client is vital for a\nconsultancy project to succeed.\nStumpf and Longman (2000: 124) suggest that \u2018a long term relationship must produce\na mutually beneficial result\u2019. One can therefore argue that consultants in addition to\nonly being preoccupied with building a short term relationship, should be concerned\nwith building a long-term one. A business consultant interviewed by De Jong and Van\nEekelen (1999) confirms this assumption and declared: \u2018the most important thing in\nthe work of a management consultant is building and maintaining a relation with your\nclient. On that basis you get the trust you need\u2019 (De Jong and Van Eekelen, 1999:\n187). Since emotions are involved in every phase of the consultancy process,\nconsultants must learn to work smoothly. Consultants must be able to create a climate\nwhere clients feel that they can trust the consultant, however in order to reach a such\nstage, \u2018the consultant is to provide exclusive and sole attention to the client and his\nobjectives. Consultants should never serve more than one master. Consultants should\nplace the client\u2019s interest ahead of theirs\u2019 (Shenson, 1990: 19).\n18\nThe relationship existing between consultants and clients is a complex one, and we\ncan actually consider what kind of skills are needed to be an efficient consultant. The\nrole of a business consultant requires a wide range of skills. As mentioned above, the\nability to create a climate favourable to the establishment of a sound relationship is\nnecessary. A consultant interviewed by McLachlin (1999: 399) declared: \u201cclimate is\ncritically important\u2026if you find that your thinking and the client\u2019s are not on the\nsame wavelength, don\u2019t hang around\u201d. Stumpf and Tymon Jr. (2001: 49) suggest that\nthe relationship existing between consultants and clients is an \u201cemotional duet\u201d, in\nwhich the consultant if willing to be effective has to learn to \u2018recognise, deal with and\nrespond to the client\u2019s emotions\u2019.\nWerr et al (1997: 300) note that \u2018consultant and client must be expected to have quite\ndifferent schemas of the change process at the beginning of the project\u2019. This\ndivergence of opinions forces consultants to learn to deal smoothly with delicate\nsituations; \u2018one has to develop the skill of telling clients they are wrong in such a way\nthat they thank you for giving helpful advice. One has to learn how to disagree\nwithout being disagreeable\u2019 (Stumpf and Tymon Jr, 2001: 49). Kubr (1996: 489)\nargues that the key to a successful relationship between consultants and clients stands\nin the proactive behaviour of the consultant. According to him, \u2018being proactive in\nconsulting implies that the consultant thinks even of those needs and requirements of\nwhich a client has not been aware, and helps the clients to realize all his or her\npossibilities, and needs\u2019. Schein (1997: 206), suggests that business consultants must\nbe humble and honest and accept the fact that sometimes they do not know about the\nclient\u2019s situation. In behaving in such a way, the trust between the two parties will be\nincreased and enhance the quality of the relationship.\nManaging the Consultant \u2013 Client Relationship\nThe first contact between consultant and client appears to be the most important one.\nKaplan (1976) argues that the first contact should allow the consultant to assess the\ngap between client expectations of process consultation and what process consultation\nactually is. As mentioned earlier, client expectations of business consultancy can be\nfalse and if the consultant is willing to develop a long-term relationship, they must\n19\nassess the client\u2019s level of expectation at the entry stage of the process and correct it\naccordingly.\nA consultant interviewed by Crucini and Kipping (2001) stresses the importance of\nthe first approach and declared \u2018you have to be careful not to scare them with an\nuninterrupted flow of words and ideas but rather you have to listen and try to\nunderstand what is their main concern before offering anything, and when you do\nthat, always use the simplest way\u2019 (Crucini and Kipping, 2001: 583)\nTable.2 The Consultant \u2013 Client relationship: Summary\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nAuthor Focus Relevance to the research\nArnaud (1998)\nRole of consultants\n\/ Demand for\nconsulting services\nThere is an obscure demand for consulting\nservices ranging from the need for consolation\nto the search of sadistic pleasure.\nCrucini and\nKipping (2001)\nConsultants as\nagents of change\nTranslation process: Business consultants must\nadapt their knowledge to the specific needs of\ntheir clients.\nJohansson (2003) Consultant \/ clientrelationship\nConsultants and clients are collaborating to the\ndevelopment of a plot\nStumpf and\nLongman (2000)\nConsultant \/ client\nrelationship\nInvestigated business consultant\u2019s skills to\ndevelop a sound relationship with their clients\nWittreich (1966:\n130)\nDemand for\nconsulting services\n\u2018Often a client who wishes to purchase a\nprofessional service sense that he has a\nproblem, but is uncertain as to what the\nspecific nature of his problem really is\u2019\n(Wittreich, 1966: 130)\nLundberg and\nYoung (2001)\nEmotions in the\nconsultancy\nprocess\nThere is a feeling of taboo about emotions in\nconsultancy\nOjasalo (2001)\nClients\u2019\nexpectation\nmanagement\nDeveloped an approach aiming at managing\ncustomers\u2019 levels of expectation.\nThere are three types of clients expectations;\nfuzzy, implicit and unrealistic.\n20\nBUSINESS CONSULTANCY: A CRITIQUE\nWilliams (2001: 519) notes that, \u2018external consulting is never far from criticism\u2019. The\nrole and efficiency of business consultants is subject to numerous criticisms and one\ncannot write on business consultancy without mentioning the main criticisms\noverwhelming the role of business consultants. Before starting an exploration of the\ndifferent criticisms, this short \u201cpoem\u201d or \u201clampoon\u201d (depending on which side you\nstand) could be used as a way to introduce this section (Ramsbottom (1981) cited in\nDe Jong and Van Eekelen, 1999: 181).\nThe Consultant\nOf all the businesses, by far,\nConsultancy's the most bizarre.\nFor, to the penetrating eye,\nThere is no apparent reason why,\nWith no more assets than a pen,\nThis group of personable men,\nCan sell to a client more than twice,\nThe same ridiculous advice,\nOr find in such a rich profusion,\nProblems to fit their own solution.\nThis self-explanatory poem shows that business consultancy is subject to virulent\ncriticisms. Before starting the analysis of the different criticisms, one must draw a\ndistinction between the criticisms towards the role of business consultants and the\ncriticisms pointing out the more or less deontological practices of some consultancies.\nIn this particular section, we intend to provide a clear and concise review of the\ndifferent criticisms overwhelming the role of business consultants and the purpose of\nconsultancy projects.\nA Dominant Position\nOrmerod (1997) argues that business consultants operate in \u201copportunistic\u201d mode.\nBloch (1999) on the other hand is very sceptical about their efficiency. He suggests\nthat \u2018as soon as consultants secure one contract, they are thinking about the next one.\nThey want ongoing work from their clients and therefore need to please the people\nwho sign the contracts\u2019 (Bloch, 1999: 115). Bloch is actually not the only one to think\nthat consultants are abusing their dominant position, Shapiro et al (1993) suggest that\n21\nconsultants, once called in to work on a project with a client, always try to extend the\nlength of their assignment. It appears to the client that they are in fact reluctant to\nleave the company. The role of business consultant as outlined previously is a delicate\none. Consultants need to balance the scope and the length of their work between their\nown or company\u2019s needs and their clients\u2019 needs. As pointed out by Arnaud (1998:\n469), consultants are confronted with a perverse alternative, \u2018either the client\u2019s initial\nrequest is answered to the letter (in order to land the contract before the competitors),\nor an analysis prior to any operational work is proposed, along with an in-depth study\nof the request itself to open up or recentre the problem initially posed\u2019. Arnaud (1998)\nimplicitly refers to the notion of ethics and integrity in business consultancy; what are\nconsultants supposed to do when their loyalties are divided between their company\u2019s\nneeds and their clients\u2019 needs?\nOn the one hand, the consultant can simply answer the demands of the client, even\nthough they may be perfectly aware that the root of the problem does not stand in the\nclient\u2019s perceived problem but in fact lies much deeper within the organisation, or\nthey can choose to be truly honest and tell the client that an in-depth analysis of the\ninfrastructure is needed and risk losing the contract, because this would be interpreted\nas an excuse to extend the length of the contract.\nConsultancy: \u201cA Modern Folly\u201d\nOther criticisms are even more virulent than those expressed by Bloch (1999) or\nShapiro et al (1993). De Burgundy (1998) for instance, when reflecting on the growth\nof state spending on management consultancy services, refers to a \u2018modern folly\u2019 (De\nBurgundy, 1998: 204). He argues that the thinking and approach underpinning\nbusiness consultancy is flawed and that the projects given to business consultants\n\u2018perform no real practical role beyond keeping certain groups of men and women\nemployed\u2019 (De Burgundy, 1998: 205). In an early article, the same author was already\nexpressing his disagreement against consultant\u2019 \u201cself-help\u201d books for which he\ndeclared have done \u2018little to relieve management problems and may, in fact, have\ncompounded them\u2019 (De Burgundy, 1995: 51).\n22\nGilbert (1998: 340) developed the concept of \u2018consultancy fatigue\u2019 as a feeling of\nfrustration and weariness about the activities of Western consultants called in to help\nEastern European managers with the economic development of countries served by\nTacis programmes. The author highlighted the feeling of frustration of some clients\nwho felt that they did not gain anything from their collaboration with Western\nconsultants. Gilbert (1998: 341) relates the experience of a Belorussian manager who\ndeclared \u201cEU experts came to study our problems; they asked us many questions, we\nprovided many answers, then they reported back to us which problems we had and\nmade some half-baked recommendations in a report written in English only and the\nprojects were over\u201d. Stiglitz (2001) in his pamphlet against the new role of the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund, highlights the highly controversial\npractises of some consultants sent to developing countries to provide them with their\nexpertise. According to Stiglitz (2001), consultants and managers do not live on the\nsame planet. This assumption is supported by De Burgundy (1995: 54) who argues\nthat the main problem in the relationship between clients and consultants is that \u2018rich\nmen and rich women see the world differently from poor men and poor women\u2019.\nAccording to De Burgundy, the difference of incomes, living standards between\nclients and consultants is at the \u2018root of the problems which bedevil consultancy\u2019 (De\nBurgundy, 1995: 54). Schein (1997: 208) recognises the character arrogant and\nmegalomaniac of some consultants who sometimes \u2018not only make the\nrecommendations but stick by them even if the client rejects them\u2019. Schein (1997:\n208) suggests that this kind of behaviour reveals a great deal of \u2018ignorance and\nmisconception about human systems\u2019.\nBusiness Consultancy: Setting the Fashion?\nMetaphors and analogies are often used when criticising business consultants. Gilbert\n(1998: 340) for instance makes an analogy between consultants and doctors or\ntherapists. She suggests that consultants are called in to carry out a diagnosis and\nprescribe a \u2018more or less painful treatment\u2019 to their clients to then go away and deal\nwith their next patient. Kostera (1995), uses a religious metaphor to describe the role\nand attitude of business consultants. According to him, consultants could be compared\nto missionaries who would come along with their set of brand new techniques and\n23\nmethods not to transfer their knowledge but to convert the locals and convince them\nthat they have solutions to all their problems.\nAnother major criticism of the role of consultants was made by Abrahamson (1991).\nHe suggests that consultants are \u201cfashion setters\u201d in charge of setting the trends and\ndemonstrate the efficiency of their \u201cbrand new\u201d tools and techniques to managers\nperpetually seeking the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d that would allow them to gain a competitive\nadvantage over their competitors. Blunsdon (2002: 6), joins Abrahamson and claims\nthat most of the problems occurring within organisations are not new and that\nsolutions are well known. Business consultants\u2019 only role is to \u2018package and\nrepackage as fashionable the solutions\u2019 and sell those \u201cpre-conceived\u201d solutions as a\nremedy to managers in difficulties. According to Collin (2000:9), consultants do not\nsell anything but \u201cold wine in new bottles\u201d. Hilmer and Donaldson (1997:8-9) pointed\nout that \u2018management is a fertile field for fads or quick fixes because problems are\nintractable\u2019. This statement brings us back to the beginning of this section when\nmentioning the dilemma faced by consultants. The pressure from shareholders,\ncompetitors and the environment is such in organisations that managers have to be\nseen to be doing something. It does not matter what it is as long as something is done\nin order to get the organisation going. This was confirmed by Arnaud (1998: 472)\nwho concluded that sometimes the situation is such that a \u2018credulous or dependent\nclient may say to an idealised consultant: \u201cnever mind what service you provide, as\nlong as you provide it\u201d\u2019.\nBusiness Consultants\u2019 Tools\nUncertainty is one of the reasons why consultancy occurs and some writers such as\nO\u2019Shea and Madigan (1997) argue that it is actually the uncertainty during the\neconomic slowdown and the market deregulation in the 1980s that created such\ndemands for consulting services. They argue that consultants exploit this uncertainty\nin order to sell even more of their services and make themselves indispensable.\nMcKinley and Scherer (2000) argue that managers perceive their environment as\nbeing particularly turbulent and are in a state of cognitive disorder. According to\nthem, \u2018consultants will be biased toward portraying it [the environment] as turbulent\nbecause this increases their clients\u2019 demands for consultancy services with the\n24\nturbulence\u2019 (McKinley and Scherer, 2000: 739). It can therefore be argued that\nconsultants are aware of the turbulent environment of managers and that instead of\nrelieving them from that feeling of uncertainty, managers are kept in that state of\nmind in order to sell even more consulting services. Bloch (1999) in his pamphlet\nagainst business consultancy suggests that everything is done in order to keep clients\nunder strict control. He draws a comparison between psychobabble; the language used\nby psychologists and business consultants\u2019 esoteric language and develop the notion\nof \u201cconsultobabble\u201d. Bloch suggests that consultobabble is by far the most\n\u2018fascinating weapon in the consulting arsenal\u2019 (Bloch, 1999: 116). According to him,\nthe rhetoric used by business consultants serves only one purpose: mystifying the\nappearance and enhancing their presence; \u2018they may give you poor advice, but they\nwill look good while they do it\u2019 (Bloch, 1999: 116). Bloch (1999) draws a line upon\nthe light and gullible pep talk of business consultants which, mixed with colourful\npie-charts and graphics, helps to keep their clients in a golden jail.\nMcKinley and Scherer (2000) hypothesised that \u201cconsultobabble\u201d reinforces the\nfeelings of uncertainty and creates an even more turbulent environment for managers,\nand therefore influences them to restructure their organisations; \u2018once perceptions of\nenvironmental turbulence are created by actual environmental turbulence,\nconsultant\u2019s rhetoric, and business press accounts, these perceptions become a major\nfactor influencing executives to engage in organisational restructuring\u2019 (McKinley\nand Scherer, 2000: 739) [Italic added]. Bloch (1999: 117) claims that consultants are\nsuperfluous and that management can sort out their problems by themselves if they\nknow \u2018what they want and are competent\u2019. Massey (2003: 310) suggests that new\nbusiness consultants are \u2018not always aware of the main theoretical frameworks for\norganisational consulting\u2019 and the author argues that this can actually weaken the\npraxis characterising business consultancy. Bloch (1999: 115) supports the idea that\njunior consultants, due to their lack of experience, are completely unable to \u2018cater for\nthe specific needs and requirements of clients\u2019. He goes even further in suggesting\nthat both novice and \u2018redundant and superseded\u2019 consultants can do much damage\nwithin clients\u2019 organisations (Bloch, 1999: 115).\nNow that the main criticisms overwhelming the role of business consultants have been\nidentified, it would be judicious and interesting to contrast these criticisms with the\n25\narguments in favour of business consultancy. Business consultants are often criticised\nfor the fact that they are external to the company and therefore do not know anything\nabout the way business is done in a particular industry. Fullerton and West (1996: 40)\nargue that although internal consultants are very much aware of an organisation\u2019s\nculture, structure or norms, their positions lack objectivity and therefore creates part\nof the problem. Williams and Rattray (2004: 180), draw the attention on the irony of\nbusiness consultancy. They find it interesting to conclude that although the demand\nfor consulting services has spectacularly increased in the past decade, business\nconsultants remain to be perceived as a \u2018much-maligned group\u2019. Numerous articles\ncriticising the role of business consultants have been identified in the literature, most\nof them lack objectivity, and are backed up with clients testifying that their\ncollaboration with business consultants was a complete fiasco. One possibility could\nbe that business consultants are not the ones to blame in case of project failure.\nBusiness Consultants: \u201cVictims of Organisational Plots\u201d\nIn many articles, clients are seen as victims of a \u201cbig plot\u201d a \u201cbig con\u201d as Bloch\n(1999) would suggest but what if victims are actually the consultants.\nKaarst-Brown (1999) provides us with an insightful hypothesized. External\nconsultants, when called in to work on an assignment, are actually being manipulated\nby their client whose agenda has already been set in advance. Kaarst-Brown (1999)\nargues that there are five symbolic roles of the external consultant. The very first role\nunconsciously played by the consultant sets the atmosphere and activates the \u2018Fear \u2013\nUncertainty \u2013 Doubts\u2019 factors within the organisation (Williams, 2001: 521). The\nsecond role of the external consultants can be qualified as one of a scapegoat. Indeed,\nexternal consultants as previously demonstrated are agents of change and therefore\nmay be used by upper management to integrate a new set of values and norms within\nthe organisation. As noted by Williams (2001: 521), \u2018the outsider is likely to attract\nless anger than the internal who may be viewed as betraying established norms and\nvalues\u2019. According to Kaarst-Brown (1999: 553), the third role of the external\nconsultant is that of \u2018power redistribution\u2019, in which consultants are identified as the\npeople responsible for the redistribution of power. The fourth role is one of the\n\u2018wishing well\u2019 (Kaarst-Brown, 1999: 555) and consists of using the consultant to deal\nwith the frustrations, hopes and suggestions of members of the organisation left in\n26\nuncertainty and doubt. The final role of external consultants stands in the departure of\nthem and marks the \u2018freezing and stabilisation of changes\u2019 (Williams, 2001: 522). The\nframework developed by Kaarst-Brown (1999) allows us to see a different aspect of\nthe client\/consultant relationship in which consultants are manipulated and involved\nin an organisational change process in which they have no control.\nArnaud (1998) adopts a psychoanalytic approach of the consultant\/client relationship\nand comes up with an unusual but insightful demand for consultancy services. The\nauthor suggests that \u2018the request as demand does not always appear in a positive light\u2019\n(Arnaud, 1998: 472). According him, the client\u2019s motivations to employ the services\nof consultants are wide and unexpected; from the need for consolation to the search of\nsadistic pleasure. Arnaud (1998) illustrates the following statement in taking the\nexample of a client challenging a consultant to find a solution to a problem,\nmeanwhile doing everything to \u2018make the situation inextricable\u2019 (Arnaud, 1998: 472).\nThe author notes that the success of a project can be jeopardised by the masochistic\ntendencies of a client looking for some sort of reprimand and who would deliberately\nfail to comply with the instructions of the consultant.\nClients\u2019 Involvement in the consultancy Process\nThe idea of the client being at the centre of the success of a project appears on a\nregular basis in the literature. McLachlin (1999: 396) suggests that \u2018if a client is not\nactively involved and ready to change, a consulting engagement is very unlikely to be\nsuccessful\u2019. This argument is supported by Schein (1990) who notes that the client\nand only him owns the problem and the solution. If over the consultation process, the\nconsultant leaves the client to distance himself from the project and rejects in his\nresponsibilities, \u201cthe war is over\u201d. Thus, the client owns a part of the responsibility in\nthe success of a consultancy project. Business consultancy is a two-way process and it\nis all too simplistic and somewhat inappropriate to always blame the consultant in the\ncase of project failure. Lindon (1995: 21) notes that the process of consultancy is to\n\u2018assist clients to solve their problems whilst not being ultimately responsible for\nsolving them\u2019.\n27\nSuch as for consultants, there are a number of metaphors putting forward the\nresponsibility of the client, Steele (1975) for instance believes that the reciprocity of\nroles is a major element of the consultation process. Thus a consultant acting as a\nteacher implies a client willing to be a student and willing to learn and who gets\nprepared for his lessons (Shenson, 1990). Schank and Abelson (1977) agrees with this\nidea and assumes that the success of a consultancy project stands in the clients\u2019\nwillingness to learn. Schuyt and Schuijt (1998: 403), argue that everything hinges \u2018on\nthe manager\u2019s belief in the cure. The manager must be prepared to change\u2019.\nMassey and Walker (1999: 455) suggest that in some occasions, clients must first\n\u2018unlearn past behaviours and processes with which they have to become familiar, in\norder to change established patterns\u2019. Individuals are generally reluctant to unlearn\nand change their habits, this phase can therefore become critical if the level of\ncommunication and trust between consultants and clients is insufficient.\nMost criticisms come from a difference in the perceptions of the role of consultants.\nThis aspect will be analysed more in depth later when exploiting the \u201crole theory\nframework\u201d, but one can argue that clients are often blinded by their idea of business\nconsultants. Arnaud (1998: 478) judiciously notes that clients are sceptical at all times\nregarding the efficiency of consultants; \u2018the substantial fees charged prove that the\nconsultant is only interested in money, but if the fee is low, or if the consultant offers\nthe service free of charge, the only possible interpretation is that the consultant is\nusing the client as a guinea-pig\u2019.\nBusiness consultants are often compared to story-makers who \u201cwould borrow your\nwatch to tell you what time it is\u201d (Lindon, 1995: 23), but Johansson (2003: 341)\nargues that the consultancy process can metaphorically be compared to the\nconstruction of a plot where instead of having the consultant trying to sell its packages\nto the client, both participate in the elaboration of a plot. He also argues that \u2018the\nmaking of a story is seen as a mode of pondering management issues so as to\nstimulate reflection and prepare for action\u2019. Jabri and Pounder (2001: 682) cited in\nJohansson (2003: 344) on the other hand note that story-telling can have positive\nimpact and can be used to \u201cexpress the richness and diversity of human experience\n28\nand thus challenge simplistic analyses of management issues such as change that can\nresult from adherence to narrow, mechanical models of human nature\u201d.\nBusiness Consultants\u2019 Rhetoric\nConcerning the rhetoric used by business consultants, Williams (2004: 181) argues\nthat \u2018the idea of a consultant-speak, the so-called consultobabble, as a means of hiding\nthe consultant\u2019s inadequacy in terms of expertise is perhaps rather simplistic, albeit a\npopular view\u2019. Clark and Salaman (1998) unlike Bloch (1999) argue that the\nconsultants\u2019 rhetoric is actually a means through which consultants craft symbols\nhelping to alleviate uncertainty. They suggest that business consultants, as well as\ntheir clients, produce and consume this rhetoric when working closely together.\nWilliams (2001) agrees with Clark and Salaman (1998) in the idea that consultants\nthrough their rhetoric give meaning to concepts and actually help managers to gain a\nbetter understanding of the problems they are facing. Williams also adds that if the\nuse of a specific language can be criticised, the simple fact of being \u2018knowledgeable is\ncritical\u2019 (Williams, 2001:520).\nOne can argue, that the whole idea of business consultants manipulating clients via a\nspecified vocabulary has become a \u201ccheap fad\u201d and can actually be perceived as an\ninsult to the professionalism of clients who would not be able to defend themselves.\nIn addition, there has been evidence that \u201cconsultobabble\u201d does not always help\nconsultants. Crucini and Kipping (2001) found out that in Italy for instance, the use of\nspecific vocabulary related to business creates anxiety and mistrust. According to a\nsole practitioner interviewed, \u2018sometimes the use of foreign terms, even the names of\nthe best-know practices such as business process reengineering, or JIT, creates\nconfusion and diffidence\u2019 (Crucini and Kipping, 2001: 583)\nSchuyt and Schuijt\u2019s (1998) study comparing consultants to magicians demonstrates\nthat crafting symbols and using a specific vocabulary is not new and is not such a\npreoccupying practice. Via an anthropological comparison they argue that through\nrituals and symbols consultants such as magicians seek to make \u2018anxiety and\nuncertainty controllable\u2019. Where it was once argued that symbols and rhetoric are the\n\u201csecret weapons\u201d of business consultants allowing them to create disorder and\n29\nuncertainty. Kertzer (1988: 4) in Schuyt and Schuijt\u2019s (1998) suggests that \u2018through\nsymbols we confront the experiential chaos that envelops us and create order\u2019. This\nhypothesis is supported by McKinley and Scherer (2000: 738) who note that some\nconsultants and practitioners are convinced that \u2018chaos and cognitive disorder are\nactually productive for innovation and performance in corporate settings\u2019.\nThis section put forward both criticisms and arguments in favour of business\nconsultancy. It appears clear now that the consultant\u2019s role is ambiguous and\nKinsely\u2019s view of the service industry appears to be a valid one. Kinsely (1979)\nsuggests that in service businesses, mainly delivered by people, one must be aware\nthat people\u2019s performance and efficiency fluctuates on a day to day basis (Kinsely,\n1979) cited in Solomon et al (1985: 100,). It therefore appears that the quality of\noutcomes with knowledge can not be predicted. Whether or not justified, when\nworking on a project with a consultant one must be aware of this fluctuation, and\nconsultants are not machines and therefore can sometimes be subjected to a decrease\nin productivity and efficiency.\nTable 3 Criticisms of Business consultancy: Summary\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nAuthor Focus Relevance to the research\nAbrahamson\n(1991)\nRole of\nbusiness\nconsultants\nConsultants are \u201cfashion setters\u201d , setting the trends and\ndemonstrate the efficiency of their \u201cbrand new\u201d tools and\ntechniques to managers.\nBloch (1999) Lack ofobjectivity\nBusiness consultants are not objectives and only seek to\nsecure their next piece of work.\nBlunsdon\n(2002)\nLack of\ninnovation\nThere are four organisational problems, in which business\nconsultants \u2018expertise can be needed: Scarcity,\nUncertainty, Instability and Conflict.\nBusiness consultant\u2019s sell re-packaged solutions known by\neveryone.\nDe Burgundy\n(1995)\nUncertainty\nand Ambiguity\nin consulting\nThe difference in living standards between clients and\nconsultants is at the \u2018root of the problems which bedevil\nconsultancy\u2019 (De Burgundy, 1995: 54)\nFullerton and\nWest (1996)\nRelationship\nconsultant \/\nclient\nAlthough internal consultants are very much aware of the\norganisation\u2019s cultures, structure or norms, their positions\nlack objectivity and this is therefore part of the problem\nKostera (1995) Metaphor\nCompares consultants to missionary.

Literature Review Model\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nIt was demonstrated in the literature review that there are three issues that must be\naddressed when reflecting upon the consultancy process, and more particularly\nreflecting upon how business consultants might perceive their role and contribution\nwithin client organisations. As represented in figure 2, the relationship with clients\nhas a direct impact on how business consultants perceive their role. Indeed, as\nsuggested by Arnaud (1998) there is an obscure demand for consulting services,\nranging from the need for consolidation to the search of sarcastic pleasure. We\nhypothesised that the relationship and the degree of emotions between consultant and\nclient strongly influence the way that the consultant perceives his role. The role of the\nconsultant itself is believed to play an important part in consultants\u2019 self perception of\ntheir role. There is a confusion about the role of the business consultant. Lippitt and\nLippitt (1986: 57) share this view and suggest that a consultant \u2018fulfils a number of\nroles that he or she judges to be appropriate for the client, the situation, and his or her\nown style\u2019. We believe that the lack of clarity and lack of role definition surrounding\n31\nconsultants is an influencing factors in terms of role perception. Since the role of\nbusiness consultants is to be investigated, role expectations will be a core element.\nWe believe that clients\u2019 expectations and preconceived ideas about how consultants\nshould be can have a serious impact on business consultants perception of their own\nrole. The study results presented in this monograph confirm this assumption.\nBUSINESS CONSULTANTS ROLE: A SELF PERCEPTION ANALYSIS\nIt has been argued on several occasions throughout this review that identifying and\nmanaging client expectations is an important factor when working as a business\nconsultant. The first expectation that business consultants have to be aware of is the\nclient expectations of the outcomes of the collaboration. Ojasalo (2001) developed an\napproach to manage customer expectations in order to achieve long-term\nrelationships. This insightful study provides us with three types of expectations\ntypical of the \u201cknowledge industry\u201d. Ojasalo (2001) stresses the importance of\nefficiently managing client expectations. According to this later, \u2018service quality and\nsatisfaction result from how well the actual service performance, in other words the\nservice process and outcome, matches the expectations\u2019 (Ojasalo, 2001: 200).\nClients\u2019 Expectations\nOjasalo (2001), identified three types of client expectations; fuzzy, implicit and\nunrealistic. As discussed in the section dealing with the relationship between\nconsultants and clients, consultants must assess from the first meeting with their client\nthe level of expectation. Fuzzy expectations reflect a blurred idea about the outcome\nof the consultancy project, clients do not have a precise idea of what the change\nshould be. The confusion of clients regarding their expectations from a consultancy\nproject appears on a regular basis in the literature; Stumpf and Longman (2000: 128)\nnoted that \u2018unlike the customer, the client is not always right, what they say they want\nis not necessarily what they really want\u2019. They also pointed out that although clients\nare somewhat unclear about what they want, \u2018they are amazingly clear about what\nthey do not want\u2019. The second type of client expectation is referred to as \u201cimplicit\nexpectations\u201d. In this particular scenario, \u2018elements of the service are so self-evident\nthat customers do not actively or consciously even think about them, or about the\n32\npossibility that they will not materialise\u2019 (Ojasalo, 2000: 203). As suggested by Kubr\n(1996), consultants need therefore to adopt a proactive approach and think further\nahead than their clients. The last expectation is likely to be the most relevant to the\nrole of business consultants; unrealistic expectations. As it has been implicitly noted\nin this review, consultants are not magicians who can resolve all problems by waving\ntheir magic wands and on some occasions client expectations are so unrealistic that\nconsultants cannot be held responsible for the failure of the project. As noted by\nWinch and Schneider (1992) in Berry and Oakley (1993: 13) \u2018the knowledge industry\ndoes not sell a product; it sells a \u201ccapacity to produce\u201d\u2019.\nThe link between the level of expectation and the role of business consultants should\nbe considered. In certain cases, client expectations of business consultants lead them\nto generate an idea of consultants based on beliefs or assumptions that can potentially\ninfluence the outcome of the relationship. Solomon et al (1985: 102) suggests that\n\u2018people are often defined by the service role they play. When an individual is labelled\nnurse, clerk or cab driver, one is able to generate a profile of this person based on the\ncharacteristics which are believed to covary with this title\u2019. Solomon\u2019s practical\nillustration refers to the notion of \u201crole perception\u201d or \u201crole identification\u201d.\nClient\u2019 Identification\nIt is always assumed that the client is easily identifiable, but Schein (1997: 202)\nargues that \u2018the question of who actually is the client can be ambiguous and\nproblematical\u2019. Schein (1997) argues that not being able to identify who the client is\ncan potentially generate goals and role conflicts that might damage the relationship\nbetween the process consultant and the client, and therefore jeopardise the project.\nSchein (1997) identified six basic types of clients: contacts, intermediate, primary,\nunwitting, indirect and ultimate clients. According to him, the needs of clients and the\nrole that they play can evolve throughout the consultation process. This change can\ntherefore affect the consultant\u2019s perception of his client\u2019s needs and expectations. As\nnoted by Schein (1997: 203), \u2018the helper is always dealing with more than one part of\nthe client system, and some parts may not have the same needs or expectations as do\nothers\u2019. When talking about role perceptions, it is possible to adopt two different\nviews. The first one as previously demonstrated puts forward consultants\u2019 perceptions\n33\nof their direct environment regarding who the client is, however it is also interesting\nto investigate what the business consultants\u2019 perception of their own role is.\nAt this point, the use of a theoretical framework has become a necessity to explore\nsuch an issue. Since we are to investigate how business consultants perceive their role\nand contribution within their client\u2019s organisations, the role theory appears to be the\nmost relevant framework as it provides \u2018a potentially useful theoretical framework for\nadvancing research on managerial jobs\u2019 (Hale, 1986) cited in Fondas and Stewart\n(1994: 86). It was argued by Johansson (2003) in the previous section, that\nconsultants and clients were developing a plot together, the role theory allows us to\nmove a step forward in suggesting that both clients and consultants, in the same way\nas actors, are playing roles in which they interact with each other. Role theory is\nreferred to by Solomon et al (1985: 102) as a \u2018dramaturgical metaphor\u2019 in which each\nrole that one play is learned. Biddle (1986: 68) suggests that \u2018most versions of role\ntheory presume that expectations are the major generators of roles, that expectations\nare learned through experience, and that persons are aware of the expectations they\nhold. This means that the role theory presumes a thoughtful, socially aware human\nactor\u2019.\nFondas and Stewart\u2019s study (1994) investigating the expectations held by individuals\ntowards managers, demonstrated that \u2018managers face an environment of role senders\nwho hold expectations about appropriate behaviour, send signals to communicate\nthese expectations about appropriate behaviour, and react to the manager\u2019s behaviour\nwith rewards and punishments\u2019 (Fondas and Stewart, 1994: 87). A simplistic way of\nlinking the role theory to the role of consultants would be to assume that consultants\ninteract with different people in their environment (what Merton (1957) calls \u201crole\nset\u201d). Every person that the consultant is in contact with, holds an expectations from\nthis interaction. The role theory suggests that in this case, consultants react to people\u2019s\nexpectations and adapt their behaviours accordingly. Szilagyi (1997: 376) notes that\n\u2018individuals in organisations are continually exposed to a variety of expectations from\ntheir work environment that may affect the perceptions of their organisational roles\u2019.\nUsing the above theoretical framework, a deeper analysis into the role of consultants\nwill be conducted, in order to ascertain how they perceive their own role. As\n34\ndiscussed in the previous sections, the turbulent environment that managers operate in\nputs them in an uncertain state of mind, Arnaud (1998) even argues that managers\nabandon themselves completely to the fate of consultants. One could argue that\nbusiness consultants are characterised with a high level of control over not only their\nenvironment, but also over the people they interact with. Since no evidence of such\nresearch was found, previous research investigating the perceived locus of control of\nmanagers to consultancy has been adapted.\nLocus of Control\nRotter (1966) first introduced the notion of locus of control, and developed a\ntheoretical framework distinguishing two types of individuals. He hypotheses that\nindividuals differ in their perception of the way things happen. \u201cExternal\u201d individuals\ntend to think that outcomes are determined by fate, chance or destiny, they believe in\nsuch a way that their fate is beyond their control. \u201cInternal\u201d individuals on the other\nhand are convinced that they have total control over their environment, and therefore\nare the only ones responsible for the quality of the outcomes. Carpenter and Golden\n(1997) suggest that the perceived locus of control of individuals\u2019 environments is\ngenerally accompanied by a perceived sense of discretion over the role that they play.\nManagerial Discretion\nThe notion of managerial discretion was developed by Hambrick and Finkelsein\n(1987) and is defined as the \u2018executives\u2019 ability to affect important organisational\noutcomes\u2019 (Carpenter and Golden, 1997: 187). Magnan and St-Onge (1996: 573) on\nthe other hand argue that managerial discretion is characterised by \u2018four attributes of a\nfirm\u2019s strategic orientation and environmental uncertainty\u2019; the range of options\navailable to executives, the programmability of their behaviour, the ambiguity of the\nrelationship between cause and effect and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome.\nAn investigation to which extent business consultants are aware of the level of control\nand discretion that they have over their direct environment will be conducted.\n35\nManagerial Power\nCarpenter and Golden, (1997: 191) when exploring managers\u2019 perceived locus of\ncontrol, noted that \u2018while internals may tend to perceive more discretion in all settings\nthan do externals, they may be more likely to adjust their assessments according to\ndifferences among situations. In contrast, we expect externals to both exhibit\nconstancy in perceived managerial discretion and to perceive relatively little\ndiscretion regardless of context\u2019.\nCarpenter and Golden (1997: 192) have found evidence that individuals\u2019 perceived\npower results from their own ability to reduce or alleviate organisational uncertainty.\nIt was demonstrated in the previous sections of this review that consultants are called\nin to help managers to reduce uncertainty. We could therefore argue that business\nconsultants must be aware of the power and control that they hold over their\nenvironment. The following assumption must however be qualified. Indeed, when\nlinking managers\u2019 perceived control and discretion with role expectations, Carpenter\nand Golden (1997: 191) found out that \u2018managerial power is an interperson\nphenomenon, whereas perceived managerial discretion is an intraperson\nphenomenon\u2019. In other words, consultants may well be perceiving themselves as\nhaving lot of control or power, but if they are not perceived as so by others, they are\nnot powerful and do not have any control.\nThe role theory allowed us to consider the role of business consultants through\ndifferent angles. It was argued that not only clients but most generally individuals\nhold expectations from others. Those perceived expectations unconsciously force the\n\u201creceiver\u201d to adapt his behaviour to respond and act accordingly. The role theory on\nthe other hand was used as a tool enabling the researchers to probe deeper into the\nperceived role of business consultants. Through this interpretivist theoretical\nframework, it was hypothesized that business consultants are characterised by a high\nlevel of control, power and managerial discretion. Business consultants\u2019 perceived\nlocus of control and discretion combined with clients\u2019 perception of the role of\nbusiness consultants could well be a source of the criticisms faced by consultants.\n36\nThe relationship between consultants and clients can be compared to that between\nmanagers and practitioners. It is interesting to note that the criticisms overwhelming\nthe role of professionals [managers] in a managerial context are similar to the\ncriticisms of managers in a professional context [scientists]. McAuley et al (2000)\nwere curious to find out whether professionals could create a \u2018relationship with\nbusiness and management such as they felt they preserved their integrity as\nprofessionals\u2019 (McAuley et al, 2000: 90). In this particular study, the roles are\nreversed, that is to say it is no longer the professionals that work in a managerial\ncontext but the inverse. McAuley et al\u2019s study (2000) revealed that the relationship\nbetween professionals and business managers is hostile and characterised with a\ngeneral misunderstanding towards each others\u2019 roles. A senior manager interviewed\ndeclared : \u201cI see business people acting as advisors and the core business run by\nscientists. We need business people who can speak our language\u201d (McAuley et al,\n2000: 102). It is surprising that even in the field of science, language barriers occur.\nThere appears to be, generally speaking, a problem of language between professionals\nand business people and that the case of clients suffering from \u201cconsultobabble\u201d is not\nisolated.\nWilliams (2003) also used the role theory to explain to a certain extent some of the\ncriticisms overwhelming the role of business consultants. He based his study on the\nresearch of Goffman (1959). Williams (2003: 136) suggests that consultancy is about\n\u2018generating an impression of a sense of knowing\u2019. Adapting the role theory to the role\nplayed by both business consultants and clients, Williams (2003: 138) concluded that\n\u2018consultobabble is a part of the role played out that conforms to the expectations of\nthe audience (client)\u2026.Managers consume consulting and \u201cconsulto-speak\u201d because\nof its symbolic value, its aesthetic value, rather than its value in use presents another\n\u201cdefence\u201d against consulting rhetoric being empty rhetoric\u2019. The role theory and its\ndramaturgical dimension enables us to see the criticisms differently. In this case,\nconsultobabble is no longer used as a weapon but as the accessory of a play.\nRole Conflict and Role Ambiguity\nOne can argue that the criticisms of the role of business consultants do not come only\nfrom expectation discrepancies, but also from role conflicts and role ambiguities.\n37\nKahn et al (1961) developed the notion of role ambiguity and role conflict and suggest\nthat such a state occurs when the behaviours expected of an individual are\ninconsistent. Consequently, individuals can experience stress, dissatisfaction and to a\ncertain extent uncertainty towards one\u2019s direct environment. When discussing role\nconflicts or ambiguity, one assumes that the client is in the majority of cases the\nvictim of false expectations, but consultants can experience role conflicts too. This\ncould occur, for example, in the case of a discrepancy between business consultants\u2019\nexpected role on a particular project and the role that he is asked to play by the client.\nRole ambiguity could occur in cases when consultants realise that they are in fact\nbeing manipulated by their client. Fondas and Stewart (1994: 89) mention another\nsituation that could lead junior consultants to a situation of role ambiguity; \u2018the\nnewcomer experiences role ambiguity and conflict upon entering an organisation and\ndiscovering a discrepancy between his expectations about the job and work situation\nand those communicated to him by the role set, especially his boss\u2019. In this scenario, it\nis not the consultant\u2019s expectations of his assignment but the consultant\u2019s expectations\nof his own environment that creates the conflict.\nTable 4 Role Theory: Summary\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nAuthor Focus Relevance to the research\nCarpenter and\nGolden (1997)\nManagerial\ndiscretion\nBusiness consultancy is characterised by a\nhigh level of managerial discretion.

As\ndemonstrated throughout this review, there are various school of thought, each of\nthem having a different opinion on what the exact role of business consultants is.\nSome academics would say that consultants have various roles, ranging from helping\nclients in identifying their problems to facilitating the learning process by transferring\nnecessary skills to managers. On the other hand, there are numerous criticisms\nsuggesting that clients are conned by consultants who are only interested in billing\nhours and abuse of their power. At this point, the best way to gain an understanding of\nwhat the role of business consultants is really about would be to consult directly with\nconsultants themselves. This reflective approach is believed to enable people outside\nthe business consultancy \u201cworld\u201d to understand precisely how business consultants\nperceive their role and contribution.\nRESEARCH RATIONALE\nFrom the available literature it seems that most criticisms directed towards consultants\ncome from either disappointed clients or academics, and this particular field of\nexpertise has been at the centre of a heated polemic for some time now. Some writers\nsuch as Abrahamson (1991) or Blunsdon (2002) have used a number of anaphors .i.e.\nstory-tellers, fashion setters to describe the \u201cshameful\u201d job of business consultants,\nwhereas others see a bright collaboration between consultants and managers in the\nconsultancy process.\nIn order to provide an objective study, it is important that the research conducted\nremain neutral in this debate, and to remain somewhat distanced from the world of\nbusiness and management consultancy. The purpose of the research project is not to\nsupport either clients who feel that they have not received good levels of service or\nbusiness consultants who wish to defend their position, but rather to ascertain how\nbusiness consultants perceive their role and contribution within their clients\u2019\norganisations.\n39\nFigure 2 represents the research scope and shows the approach taken throughout this\nstudy. In previous studies, an external approach was often adopted. In other words,\nclients were given the opportunity to discuss their collaboration with business\nconsultants in terms of relationship management, efficiency, discretion and control.\nAs one can expect, clients who are deeply involved in the consulting process might\nfind difficult to step back and \u201ctake a fresh look\u201d at their collaboration with business\nconsultants. One can also argue that well before the consulting process has started,\nclients opinion has already been influenced by two factors: the perceived role and\nexpectations of the role of business consultants. The differentiator in this study stands\nin the approach adopted. As illustrated in figure 2, business consultants are requested\nto reflect on their collaboration with clients. In doing so, a new insight into the way\nbusiness consultants perceive their role and the consulting process is gained.\nFigure. 2 Research Scope\nSource: Compiled by the authors\n40\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES\nIt could be considered that this study is nothing more than asking a certain category of\npeople how they feel about their job role. However, the main differentiator of this\nstudy stands in the fact that more than simply asking people how they feel about their\njob, roles are actually reversed and business consultants are required to reflect upon\ntheir own perception of their role. As previously discussed, substantial research has\nbeen carried out on business consultancy, but little documentation has emerged on\nbusiness consultancy from an internal viewpoint. This reflective approach is believed\nto enhance our understanding of the role of business consultants; who can better\ncomment on the role of business consultants than the people concerned themselves?\nThe research study aims to analyse how business consultants perceive their\nrelationship with their clients and how important role expectations are in this\nrelationship. It is hypothesised in the review of the literature that business consultants\nhave a high level of discretion and control, not only over the relationship with their\nclient, but over the whole consultancy process. This study therefore aims at gauging\nto which extent business consultants are aware of this control and to which extent they\nare exercising it.\nINQUIRY QUESTION\nIn order to reach the objectives outlined above, the following inquiry question is\nposed:\nHow do business consultants perceive their role and contribution within clients\u2019\norganisations?\nIn order to draw the most accurate picture, the following issues will be examined:\n\uf076 How do business consultants perceive their role?\n\uf076 How do business consultants perceive their relationship with their\nclients?\n41\n\uf076 To which extent are business consultants aware of the control and\ndiscretion that they hold over consultancy projects?\n\uf076 Is role expectation a plausible explanation of the discrepancy existing\nbetween the perception of consultants and their clients?\nMETHODOLOGY\nBusiness consultants were requested to adopt a reflective approach throughout the\nresearch project, and the importance of the data gathering and analysis stages in the\nresearch cannot be stressed enough. This methodology section therefore deals with the\nmethods and procedures that have been put in place, and highlights the difficulties\nfaced when conducting this research project. Kaplan (1973: 93) in Clough and\nNutbrown (2002: 29) argues that the major aim of the methodology section of a\nresearch project is to \u2018describe and analyse methods, throwing light on their\nlimitations and resources, clarifying their suppositions and consequences, relating\ntheir potentialities to the twilight zone at the frontiers of knowledge\u2019.\nTherefore, the first part of the methodology section deals with the study design and\nresearch approach; the opportunity is taken to outline the type of research, the\ncharacteristics of the participants, in addition to the method used to collect the data.\nSecondly, ethical considerations are addressed. The importance of ethics and the\ndifferent techniques used in order to assure the anonymity of participants are outlined.\nIn the final section, the different methods used to analyse the data are discussed. The\nsubjectivity of the research will be acknowledged and an explanation is given on how\nthis was limited.\nResearch approach and study design\nResearch Philosophy\nSaunders et al (2003: 83) define the research philosophy as \u2018the way that you think\nabout the development of knowledge\u2019. When considering the research philosophy and\nresearch approach, a dilemma was faced. Since this research stands in the perception\n42\nof a particular group of people (business consultants) of their own contribution and\nimpact on a third party\u2019s environment (clients), a positivist approach was adopted.\nRemenyi et al (1998: 33) in Saunders et al (1998: 83) compare positivism to the role\nof natural scientists. According to them, researchers adopting a positivism approach\nprefer \u2018working with an observable social reality and that the end product of such\nresearch can be law-like generalisations similar to those produced by the physical and\nnatural scientists\u2019. Remenyi et al (1998: 33) also suggest that when using a positivist\napproach, \u2018the researcher is independent of and neither affects nor is affected by the\nsubject of the research\u2019. It appears that a positivist approach was adopted, however\ndue to the nature of the aim of the research project, it could be argued that an\ninterpretive\/reflective approach was requested from consultants. Saunders et al (2003:\n84) suggests that the role of the interpretivist is to \u2018seek to understand the subjective\nreality of those that they study in order to be able to make sense of and understand\ntheir motives, actions and intentions in a way that is meaningful for these research\nparticipants\u2019. To conclude on this section, on the one hand it is argued that the overall\nthinking and philosophy behind the research is positivist, but on the other hand the\napproach to the research question and participants\u2019 approach to the protocol is\ninterpretivist.\nResearch Approach and Strategy\nResearch Approach\nSaunders et al (2003 : 85) suggests that research can be qualified as inductive when\nthe researcher collects data and develops a theory as a result of the data analysis. The\nstudy results presents a model designed from the different data analyses conducted. In\nthis respect new knowledge about the role of business consultants was gained,\njustifying the inductive approach of the research.\nResearch Strategy\nSaunders et al (2003: 90) suggests that a research strategy is a \u2018general plan of how\nthe researcher will go about answering the research question that was set\u2019. It was\nagreed that a survey was the most appropriate research strategy. Although the data\ncollection method will be discussed further in this section, as judiciously pointed out\nby Saunders et al (2003: 90), a survey research strategy encompasses a wide range of\n43\ndata collection methods. In this particular case, semi-structured interviews were\nutilised.\nStudy Design\nWhen browsing the literature about business consultancy, it was noted that the vast\nmajority of criticisms were actually written by either academics or clients (articles\nwritten by consultants and practitioners deliver a more positive message) but very few\nstudies focus on how business consultants perceive their own role.\nSince this research project involves a reflective approach, it was felt that a qualitative\napproach would be the most appropriate. Strauss and Corbin (1990: 17) define\nqualitative research as \u2018any kind of research that produces findings not arrived at by\nmeans of statistical procedures or other means of quantification\u2019.\nTo successfully carry out such a study, a number of fundamental skills had to be\ndeveloped. Strauss and Corbin (1990) agree with this statement and suggest that the\nresearcher must be able to \u2018step back and critically analyse situations, to recognise\nand avoid bias, to obtain valid and reliable data, and to think abstractly\u2019 (Strauss and\nCorbin, 1990: 18)\nQualitative research can increase the level of interaction with respondents and\ntherefore can help in developing the trust needed to obtain valid information. This\nbelief is shared by Gummesson (1991: 2) who suggests that \u2018in using qualitative\nmethods the borderline between the academic researcher and the management\nconsultant becomes blurred, particularly as the role of the consultant provides\nopportunities for intensified inquiry into the behaviour of business firms and other\norganisation\u2019 [italic added].\nPrimary data was therefore collected largely via face-to-face interviews, whereas\nsecondary data (mainly journal articles of academics and professionals) was used in\nthe literature review. Secondary data appeared to be useful in the discussion and\nresearch results section as they enabled a comparison of business consultants\u2019 views\nand the views of academics and other practitioners to be conducted.\n44\nNegotiation of Access\nLetters and e-mails were sent to major consultancies in order to gain contacts, and to\narrange for meetings to take place. This method proved to be effective, although only\ntwo consultants out of the fifteen asked agreed to participate in the research.\nInterviews were also arranged via existing contacts within the industry. This method\nwas much more rapid, and it was noted that it was easier to build a relationship with\nthese consultants, since their level of mistrust was much lower. Having overcome the\nissue of gaining access to consultants willing to participate in the study, a new issue\nwas faced; finding a convenient time for the meetings. As previously discussed,\nbusiness consultancy is a highly challenging area where consultants are assigned\nprojects involving interviews, meetings, writing proposals, and the role is often\nconducted on client sites and therefore involves considerable amounts of travel.\nAlthough all the consultants interviewed seemed enthusiastic to help, it could often\ntake several weeks before consultants could find a convenient time to meet for the\ninterview. Interviews were conducted at either consultant\u2019s offices or homes, always\nat a time and a day agreed between both parties to ensure that the interviewees would\nbe able to fully concentrate on their answers.\nParticipant Selection\nRegarding the selection of the participants, the first thing that had to be done was to\nconsider which categories of jobs could actually be considered as business or\nmanagement consulting. As highlighted in the consultancy overview, the field of\nconsultancy has been hoisted with its own petard and the situation nowadays is such\nthat anyone who pretends to be able to give advice in a particular field may proclaim\nhimself to be a consultant. Therefore the inclusion of \u201cadvisors\u201d in the study was\navoided, as this would have biased the whole study and jeopardised the relevance of\nthe results. Consultancy is a very broad field and there are numerous types of\nconsultants each specialised in specific areas. It was agreed that the scope of\nconsultants had to be large and include a wide range of business consultants in order\nto validate the study and provide an unbiased set of results.\nInterviews of business consultants specialised in field as varied as Management,\nInformation Technology, Organisational Change and Corporate Finance were\nconducted. In addition, interviews with coaches involved in personal development\n45\nwere conducted. The sample also includes interviews of academics working as\nbusiness consultants and freelance consultants. In order to widen the scope of\nconsultants interviewed, it was decided that the sample should include business\nconsultants operating at different levels within organisations, and also those working\nfor different types of company. Therefore, the sample includes partners and senior\nconsultants, functional and operational consultants, freelance consultants as well as\npeople intervening in the strategic decision process at the upper management levels of\nmultinational corporations.\nRegarding the size of the sample, Strauss and Corbin (1990: 179) suggests that\n\u2018decisions regarding the number of sites and observations or interviews depend also\nupon access, available resources, research goals, plus time and energy. Later, these\ndecisions may be modified according to the evolving theory\u2019. Since a qualitative\nresearch approach was adopted, the quality rather than the quantity of interviews was\ntaken into consideration. After 17 in-depth interviews, data saturation was reached.\nWe firmly believe that this number is high enough to accurately reflect how business\nconsultants perceive their role. Guest et al (2006: 59) found that \u2018saturation occurred\nwithin the first twelve interviews, although basic elements for metathemes were\npresent as early as six interviews.\u2019\nMethods for Data Collection\nAs noted by Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 66), \u2018the respondent\u2019s answers constitute the\nraw data analysed at a later point in time by the researcher\u2019. Although face-to-face\ninterviews was the preferred method to collect data, in a number of cases, when\nconsultants were either living abroad or unavailable for face-to-face interviews, the\ninterview protocol was e-mailed. Although this method had its limitations, some\nrelevant primary data was collected in this way.\nMcCracken (1988: 65) suggests that a face to face interview allows the researcher \u2018to\ncapture how the respondent sees and experiences the world\u2019. As judiciously suggested\nby Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 72) \u2018each type of interview is designed to achieve a\nparticular research task\u2019. Thus, when talking to previous masters\u2019 students who have\nconducted similar research projects, it was suggested that semi-structured interviews\nallow more interactions between the researcher and the interviewee and allow the\n46\nresearcher to probe beyond specific questions. Although semi-structured, wherever\npossible questions were asked in the same order during the interviews, in order to gain\nsome level of consistency in the answers provided. Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 71)\njustify such a practice in assuming that it allows the researcher to get an effect of\n\u2018standardising stimuli\u2019.\nBeeby and al (1998) as well as Rodham (2000) opted for the same method when\nconducting interviews. Rodham (2000: 76) argues that \u2018a degree of structure and\ndirection can be given to the interview; while at the same time; this approach is\nsufficiently flexible to allow respondents to make contributions that they considered\nto be important\u2019. In order to facilitate the process and the transcript of the data, each\ninterview was recorded. This practice is said to allow the researcher to \u2018take part in\nthe conversation in a natural way\u2019 since they do not have to take notes. (Burns, 2000:\n429)\nProtocol Design\nDuring the design of the protocol, three major issues had to be borne in mind. As\nmentioned earlier, the research project involved different types of consultants\noperating at different levels within the organisation and dealing with different types of\ncustomers. The major difficulty in designing the protocol was to ensure it was feasible\nfor every kind of consultant. In other words, the protocol had to be designed in a way\nthat questions were applicable and could be answered by management, finance or\nfreelance consultants. The second issue concerned the quality and the level of\nrelevance of the protocol. The quality of the protocol of a qualitative research project\nis critical, but was even more so in this particular case, since business consultants\nwere requested to adopt a reflective approach and think in terms of their own role and\ncontribution. The final issue concerned the progressivism of the questionnaire. Since\nparticularly sensitive issues were tackled (i.e. the different criticisms of the role of\nbusiness consultants, and discussions regarding business ethics and business\nintegrity), it was agreed that the protocol had to be designed in a way that would not\nthreaten consultants.\nThe importance of setting up the atmosphere and taking the time to talk about the\nresearch project before asking questions to business consultants was stressed earlier.\nThis is the reason for the interview protocol (Appendix 1) to start with a few\n47\nbackground questions, which are aimed at setting up the atmosphere, before then\nmoving smoothly towards addressing real issues.\nEthical considerations\nConfidentiality and ethics is an important issue when conducting a research project.\nKallman and Grillo (1996: 3) provide a pragmatic definition of ethics in suggesting\nthat \u2018ethics has to do with making a principle-based choice between competing\nalternatives. In the simplest ethical dilemmas, this choice is between right and wrong\u2019.\nThis section aims to stress the importance of ethics in the research project. As pointed\nout by Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 77), \u2018the task of the interviewer is to obtain\ninformation, often of a highly personal and private nature, from a respondent who is a\nstranger and has a little time and effort answering questions\u2019. Business consultants are\nextremely busy people and it was felt that the least that could be done to express\ngratitude was to ensure that the anonymity of participants was guaranteed.\nAckroyd and Hughes (1981: 78), stressed out the importance of building a sound\nrelationship between the researcher and the interviewee, \u2018the interviewer must\ncommunicate trust, reassurance, and likeableness to the respondent in order to\nmaintain his or her interest and motivation in the continuance of the interview.\nInterviewer should never threaten respondents or destroy their confidence in the\nrelationship\u2019. It is firmly believed that this trust-based relationship can only exist if\nthe researcher adopts an irreproachable ethical behaviour. Fritzsche (1997: 22) shares\nthe same view and confirms that a correct ethical behaviour develops trust amongst\npeople. Therefore prior to commencing the interview, interviewees were asked for\ntheir permission to be recorded. The repercussions that a breach in confidentiality\ncould have on interviewees\u2019 careers was very clear, and therefore assurances to the\ninterviewees that their identity, the company they are working for or the names of\nclients would not be mentioned in the research. Consequently, it is possible to observe\nin the chapter dedicated to the research results and discussion that interviewees are\nreferred to as interviewee \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, etc. Burns (2000) when discussing the\nimportance of adopting an ethical behaviour made a point worth exploring. He\ndeveloped the notion of \u201cinformed content\u201d and suggested that \u2018participants must\nunderstand the nature and purpose of the research and must consent to participate\n48\nwithout coercion\u2019 (Burns, 2000: 18). Ethical behaviour goes further than simply\nassuring the confidentiality of the data and involves a mutual understanding of the\nreasons and the expected outcomes driving the research project. Therefore, at the time\nof contacting business consultants, a copy of the research proposal was included to\nensure that those who agreed to participate in the study were aware of the aims of the\nstudy and the expected outcome.\nAs pointed out by Burns (2000: 21), researchers are tied to interviewees by several\nimplicit contracts. Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 77) suggest that, \u2018a respondent is free\nto refuse to give an interview or break off at any moment\u2019. In order to try to minimise\nthe risk of this before commencing interviews, basic introductions and an explanation\nof the rationale behind the research project was given. At the end of the interview,\nrespondents were given the opportunity to obtain a copy of the transcript to assure\nthemselves that no names or organisations had been mentioned. In addition,\nrespondents were offered a copy of the results once the research project was\ncompleted.\nMethods for data analysis\nSapsford and Jupp (1996) suggests that the most difficult part of a qualitative research\nstudy stands in the analysis process; \u2018the most common question asked by researchers\ncarrying out qualitative data analysis for the first time, and the one that is the most\ndifficult to answer is: now I\u2019ve got the data, what do I do with it?\u2019 (Sapsford and\nJupp, 1996: 286)\nAlthough there are no sets of rules, there is almost universal agreement in the way that\nthe data must be analysed. It appeared from the relevant literature that the data\nanalysis in qualitative research is a two step process.\nInterview Transcription\nThe first task consists of transcribing the data recorded during the interviews. As\njudiciously mentioned earlier on by Ackroyd and Hughes (1981), respondents\u2019\nanswers constitute the raw material of the analysis. Therefore, researchers must\n49\ncarefully select those pieces of information that are relevant to their analysis. To do\nso, the interview transcribing appears to be a necessary process.\nBurns (2000: 429) suggests that \u2018transcribing the data from a tape recording is a\nlaborious and time-consuming task\u2019. Although highly time-consuming, the\ntranscription appeared to have facilitated the categorisation of information. As pointed\nout by Becker (1970) in Sapsford and Jupp (1996: 290), data analysis is a continuous\nprocess carried out by the researcher; \u2018analysis is carried out on sequentially,\nimportant parts of the analysis being made while the researcher is still gathering his\ndata\u2019 (Becker, 1970: 26-7). As soon as an interview had been conducted, it was\ntranscribed. This proved a successful method of working, because it was much more\nsimple to transcribe interviews whilst small details and reactions to particular\nquestions were still fresh in the memory.\nThe Categorisation Process\nBurns (2000: 414), argues that data categorisation is the first step in the analysis\nprocess; \u2018often there are \u201cnatural\u201d breaks in the material which can be used to break it\nup into chunks that can then be allocated to particular categories\u2019. Once transcribed,\nthe relevant information was put into categories and these categories were allocated\nnames. This method allowed a clear identification of which information had to be\nused and contrasted with the secondary data appearing in the literature review section.\nCategories were taken from the literature and from the collected data itself (Glaser\nand Strass, 1976). The categorisation process was done manually, following the\nguideline of Glaser and Strauss (1967).\nStrauss and Corbin (1990) argue that although researchers on some occasions may\ncome across \u2018prototypical cases that fits the pattern exactly\u2019, there is usually no\nperfect fit; \u2018one tries to place cases in the most appropriate context, using the criterion\nof best rather exact fit. But one doesn\u2019t force a match. There are cases that do not\nseem to belong anywhere. There are apparent reasons for that\u2019 (Strauss and Corbin,\n1990: 139)\n50\nResearch Validity\nOne cannot conduct qualitative research without acknowledging the potential bias of\nthe research project. As pointed out by Sapsford and Jupp (1996: 283), \u2018with\ninterviewing data, it is necessary to remember that the questions asked are likely to\nhave influenced the answers given\u2019. In the case of this research project, the adoption\nof a neutral position during interviews has been attempted as much as possible.\nPotential biases have also been limited by the fact that questions in the majority of\ncases have not been sent to respondents before interviews, thus enabling a degree of\nspontaneity in the answers given. This has only being possible when contact was\nestablished via a recommendation from another consultant, therefore there was an\nexisting established level of trust.\nAckroyd and Hughes (1981: 81) argue that it is known that people can lie or \u2018say\nthings intended to maximise their self-esteem\u2019, but as consultants did not perceive the\ninterviewer as a threat, the sincerity and honesty in the answers received were\nsurprising. As also suggested by Ackroyd and Hughes (1981: 80), \u2018the interviewer is\ngiving the respondent a chance to talk anonymously without fear of contradiction,\nsigns of boredom, disagreement, disapproval, and so on, often about deeply personal\nmatters; a temptation that few of us would not be able to resist\u2019. In that respect it was\nclear during the interviews that consultants were enjoying talking about their role and\nappreciated the fact that a neutral position in the debate had been adopted. The\nrewarding side of this research came from several consultants who thanked the\nresearchers for letting them express themselves freely.\nThe subjectivity of the research project constitutes a potential bias. As pointed out by\nBurns (2000: 414), \u2018it is too easy for the prejudices and attitudes of the researcher to\nbias the data. Particularly when the data must go through the researcher\u2019s mind before\nit is put on paper, the worry about subjectivity arises\u2019. This aspect is one of the most\nimportant downsides of qualitative research and although a neutral approach has been\nattempted, any personal influence on the findings can never be totally guaranteed.\n51\nSUMMARY\nThroughout this section, the importance of establishing a clear method when\nconducting qualitative research was discussed. It was observed that business ethics in\naddition to data confidentiality is a core element of any research. This section also\ngave the opportunity to discuss the different methods used to approach business\nconsultants. The complexity of the protocol led to the consideration of different\napproaches at the time of conducting the interviews and a two-way relationship with\nthe respondent was finally decided upon. It could be considered that only the\nresearchers stood to gain from the discussions with business consultants, but this\nresearch project was also an opportunity for business consultants to talk freely and\nanonymously about their role and their perceived impact on their clients\u2019\norganisations. This often appeared to provide some form of counselling and relief to\nconsultants, giving them an opportunity to discuss their job whereas the contrary is\nnormally the case.\nSTUDY RESULTS\nEmerging themes\nAs explained in the methodology section, data was collected via semi-structured\ninterviews with business consultants specialised in fields as varied as IT, Change\nManagement and Corporate Finance.\nThe data analysis process enabled us to identify four main themes that will be\naddressed individually throughout this section.\nThe four majors themes are as follows:\n- Consultants\u2019 Role and Contribution.\n- Consultant-Client Relationship.\n- Consultants\u2019 Skills and Responsibilities.\n- Pros and Cons of the Consultant\u2019s Role.\n52\nCONSULTANT ROLE AND CONTRIBUTION\nThis particular section constitutes the main body of this research results section. It\naims to understand how business consultants themselves perceive their role and their\ncontribution within client organisations.\nThree sub-themes emerged from the analysis regarding the business consultants role:\n- Contribution\n- Level of control\n- Level of discretion\nWhen business consultants were asked how they perceive their role, it was expected\nthat a wide variety of answers would be collected. Researchers such as Lippitt and\nLippitt (1986) have argued that business consultants adopt a variety of roles\ndepending on clients\u2019 specific situations. Interviewee \u201cA\u201d for instance declares that he\nnever really reflected upon how business consultants should behave. Interviewee \u201cA\u201d\nsuggests that he acts in a number of ways that help him to reach an expected outcome.\nIn this respect, business consultants fulfil mainly one role: Providing their client with\nexpertise and experience, but there are different ways to help clients.\n\u201c\u2026my role as a business consultant is to help to resolve an\norganisational issue and achieve objectives and in doing that one plays I\nthink a number of parts. There is a necessity to act in a number of\ndifferent ways depending on the circumstances\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\nContribution\nThe first sub-theme that will be analysed in this section deals with business\nconsultants\u2019 views of their contribution within client organisations. The data analysis\nprocess revealed that business consultants see their role in terms of two different\naspects:\n- Adding value for clients\n- Move clients forward\nAdding-Value for Clients\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d claims that business consultants have only one role: adding-value for\nthe clients. However, he agrees with interviewee \u201cA\u201d in saying that there is more than\n53\none way \u201cto skin a cat\u201d. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d provides us with a practical example\nillustrating this assumption.\n\u201c\u2026We only have one role: it\u2019s adding value for our clients, however,\nadding value could be taking cost out of business, identifying business\nopportunities through mergers and acquisitions, re-engineering supply\nchain. It is all about adding value\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nIt is fascinating that in the controversial role of business consultants, clients are\nactually placed above all else and helping them is perceived to be the ultimate\nobjective. It was argued in the section dealing with the criticisms in the literature\nreview that consultants take advantage of clients and abuse their dominant position.\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d for instance is particularly honest towards his role and admits that\nultimately his role is to earn money for the company that he is working for, but he\nalso stresses the importance of constantly being aware that consultants are working\nfor their clients. They must therefore be able to offer advice in the best interests of\nclients or, if it is the case, to admit that they do not have the answer.\n\u201c\u2026ultimately it would be to earn money for the company but you are\nworking with the customer, so it is a question of understanding what they\nare about, then being able to offer advice. Or, if it is appropriate to say\nthat you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\nMoving Clients Forward\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d, a niche consultant argues that he does not know what his role is\ngoing to be until he has met the client and identified the reasons why he is called in.\nHe also expresses the will to \u201chelp moving the client\u201d forward.\n\u201c\u2026it is an eclectic role. I don\u2019t know what help means for that client until\nI go in there\u2026my ambition is to help moving the client forward, they will\ndetermine what moving forward means but in a positive way\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nInterviewee \u201cO\u201d also feels that his role as a consultant is to help in moving the client\nforward. He suggests that the role of consultants is similar to that of a marketing\n54\ncampaign. Interviewee \u201cO\u201d argues that his role is to facilitate the movement of his\nclients from where they are to where they aim to be.\n\u201c\u2026As a facilitator, my role would be to move someone from where they\nare today to where they want to be tomorrow\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee O\nAs demonstrated in the literature review, metaphors and different anaphors are used\n(most of the time in a pejorative way, i.e. \u201cstory-tellers, fashion-setters\u201d) in order to\ndefine and characterise the role of business consultants. It was surprising that on two\noccasions, when asked to reflect upon their own role, business consultants came up\nwith their own set of metaphors. Thus, interviewee \u201cH\u201d would compare herself to a\ntrouble-shooter. Interviewee \u201cF\u201d on the other hand came up with a more \u201cextreme\u201d\nmetaphor. According to him, the role of business consultants is to explore the fear and\nuncertainty of managers, and in that respect they can be compared to parasites.\n\u201c\u2026To be honest, consultants are parasites who explore the fear and\ninability of management to make decisions\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee F\nIt appears that business consultants share a common goal: moving clients forward in\nhelping them to solve organisational issues. As argued earlier on, business consultants\nhave been criticised for taking advantage of clients, but in this research, business\nconsultants have shown an interesting degree of professionalism and humility.\nProject Control: Locus of Control\nMany complaints were directed towards the amount of control that business\nconsultants have over projects, but as suggested by Carpenter and Golden (1997),\nconsultants may well be thinking that they have lot of control, but if they are not\nperceived as so by others, their control is actually minimal. In this research project,\nbusiness consultants were asked whether they exercise this control or not. This\nexercise enabled us to assess whether the consultants interviewed had an internal or\nexternal locus of control (Rotter, 1966).\nThe Table 5 below illustrates the findings of this exercise. As explained in the\nliterature review, there are two types of personality: people having an internal locus of\ncontrol, or people having an external locus of control. The main differentiator\n55\nregarding these two perceptions stands in an individual\u2019s perceived level of control.\nWhereas externals would tend to think that outcomes are determined by fate, chance\nor destiny, internals see themselves as having full control over their direct\nenvironment. In the case of this research, it is interesting to note that most of the\nbusiness consultants interviewed feel that they have a good deal of control over their\ncollaboration with managers, and perceive themselves as being able to control and\ninfluence the outcome of the consulting process.\nThe reason underpinning such an exercise stands in the fact that much of the criticism\nhas been directed towards the level of control that some consultants have. Business\nconsultants were asked to rank on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being low external locus of\ncontrol, 10 being high internal locus of control), the amount of control they think they\nhave over projects. In table 5, we can see that the vast majority of consultants are\ninternals, with a level of control ranging from 7 to 10.\n56\nTable 5.

This is a graphic representation of table 5. There are several instances where\ndata is not presented. This is the case for interviewees \u201cI\u201d, \u201cJ\u201d, \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d where\ndata has either not been captured or when graphic representation was not possible.\nPersonal Internal Locus of Control\n\uf0b7 Control Given by the Client\nIt appears that the vast majority of consultants see themselves as having a fairly high\nlevel of control. Interviewee \u201cH\u201d justifies this assumption in suggesting that she is\ngiven the permission to take control of some aspects of the project by the client. She\nsuggests that some consultants have for instance, the control and the discretion of\ninterviewing, monitoring who they want, virtually whenever they want.\n\u201c\u2026the client is giving you permission to take control of certain\nthings\u2026some of the consultants because they have to go in to interview\npeople, to watch people have a level of control\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee H\nInterviewees \u201cK\u201d and \u201cL\u201d agree with the above statement, they both feel that they\nhave a good deal of control over the different projects. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d argues that he\nhas a high level of control and that some clients are actually quite happy with that\n58\nsituation. He suggests that clients want projects to be delivered on time and within a\nspecific budget, and as long as they understand what he does, the control is given to\nhim. He therefore becomes the person who decides who needs to be interviewed, what\nhas to be done, when meetings should take place and what will be discussed.\n\u201c\u2026as long as the client understands what you are doing, you actually\nhave a lot of control. It is in fact passed on to you by the client. I run it\nand I say to the guy who signs up, we\u2019ll have those meetings and we\u2019ll\nraise those issues\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\n\uf0b7 Control Due to Client\u2019s Uncertain Environment\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d suggests that the level of control given to him varies during the\nconsulting process. According to him there are times in the process when he can have\na large amount of control .i.e. when clients experience uncertainty\n\u201c\u2026It can also be higher when client are in a confusion or crisis stage,\nand need an external source to help them out, by structuring, providing\nsteps and control. However I try to make this not last, by providing\nfeedback to encourage, and push for autonomy\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee P\n\uf0b7 Control Due to Client\u2019s Lack of Expertise\nInterviewee \u201cM\u201d argues that the level of control over projects depends on two factors;\nthe client\u2019s level of experience in a particular field and the size of the organisation.\nAccording to him, with single country clients, his level of control is enormous\nbecause the organisation has little experience. On can argue that there is a link\nbetween the company\u2019s level of expertise and the amount of control given to\nconsultants. Interviewee \u201cM\u201d declared that in some situations, consultants have such a\nlevel of control that they can end up making decisions for clients. On the other hand,\nwhen working with larger organisations, interviewee \u201cM\u201d feels that it is much more\ndifficult to influence clients; his level of control can actually be down to nothing.\n\u201c\u2026with single country Clients, having a single corporate centre\/HQ, the\ndegree of influence can get past 10, to 11 and even 12, because the\nconsultant can be an expert in an area where the client has little or no\nexperience at all\u2026Clients with multiple operating units are very hard to\ninfluence, their internal competing agenda will prevent external influence.\nAt this point, you can get down to zero\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee M\n59\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d, although feeling like she has a good degree of control argues that it\nis not possible for consultants to have full control of projects nor should they.\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d justifies her high level of control by the fact that she is working in a\nmuch specialised area where not so many people have expertise, and in fact her level\nof expertise gives her some control. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d suggests that nobody ever has\n100% control, because having full control would mean that consultants do not have to\nanswer to anyone, not even clients.\n\u201c\u2026I do not think that anybody would ever get a full control and nor\nshould they\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d on the other hand argues that the level of control given to consultants\ndepends on clients\u2019 perception of which type of consultant is needed to solve the\nproblem. For example, interviewee \u201cE\u201d explains that if the client sees him only as a\ncontractor, he would have no control. Alternatively, if he is perceived as a \u201cprincipal\nknowledge engineer\u201d, the client would put his employees or the information team\nunder his control to assist him. In that scenario, the level of control held would be\nvery high. However, interviewee \u201cE\u201d fully agrees with interviewee \u201cD\u201d and suggests\nthat consultants can never have full control over projects simply because ultimately\nclients pay the bills.\n\u201c\u2026it is down to your role as they perceive it, not as you perceive it but as\nthey perceive it. That\u2019s the critical thing, it does not matter who you\nare\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\n\uf0b7 Control Due to Level of Involvement\nInterviewee \u201cN\u201d argues that her level of control fluctuates in accordance with her\nlevel of involvement. According to her, she has much more control when working as\nan independent consultant rather than when working on behalf of her current\norganisation.\n\u201c\u2026It depends to what degree I am involved because in an organisation\nlike this, someone else has usually talk to the organisation before I see the\nperson, I have got less control. If I am working in my own right as an\nindependent consultant I will have more control\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee N\n60\nPersonal External Locus of Control\nAccording to interviewee \u201cE\u201d, the level of control depends on the client\u2019s perception\nof the role of the consultant. In this case, it could be argued that the further up in the\norganisation the consultant operates, the more control is passed on to him. Interviewee\n\u201cI\u201d, a niche consultant operating at top management level does not feel as though he\nhas any control at all, but is very much aware of the amount of control that some\nconsultants do have. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d condemns the behaviour of some consultants\nworking with chief executives who act as \u201csoldiers\u201d. According to him, at times, some\nconsultants can become more powerful than the chief executives themselves.\n\u201c\u2026I have got no control\u2026 some consultants only work with clients like\nchief executive or general manager and in reality they do not act as\nconsultants at all. They act as the soldiers of the CE and that is for me not\nconsulting but dictating, bringing in, guns from outside to shoot\npeople\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nInterviewee \u201cO\u201d also possess an external locus of control. As a career management\nconsultant, interviewee \u201cO\u201d argues that his clients are in control of their career.\nAlthough his role is to help move them forward, they are ultimately responsible for\nthe outcome.\n\u201c\u2026No I don\u2019t think you can control it, individuals are going to do what\nthey are going to do, you are trying to know where those individuals are\nheading and can you go at least along side with them. Sometimes you feel\nthat you can nudge them on way or another but it has to come from within\nthem, they have to take on board the changes that there are\nexperiencing\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee O\nTo conclude on this section, it can be argued that consultants are very much aware of\nthe control that they have over their different assignments. Some consultants argue\nthat the control that is passed on to them is due to the client\u2019s lack of a particular skill\nin their organisation.\nAs highlighted in the criticisms section of the literature review and confirmed by\ninterviewee \u201cI\u201d, there is a potential danger for clients when they give out so much\npower and control to external consultants. Clients might not have the chance to\n61\ncollaborate with consultants who behave ethically and who do not see them as\npotential \u201ccash cows\u201d.\nLevel of Discretion\nIt was argued earlier on that business consultants, when working in a client\norganisation, are given to them by the client the discretion that they need to change\nthe way they approach problems, and the way in which they run the consulting\nprocess. In this research, Carpenter and Golden\u2019s (1997) definition of discretion was\nadopted. They define managerial discretion as \u2018executives\u2019 ability to affect important\norganisational outcomes\u2019 (Carpenter and Golden, 1997: 187)\nBusiness consultants for the purpose of this research project were asked to comment\non their level of discretion. Two majors sub-themes emerged from the data gathering\nstage.\n- Need for unlimited discretion\n- Balancing between needs\nUnlimited Discretion\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d has the feeling of exercising his discretion to a great length and feels\nthat he is left to run the project as he sees fit. He confirmed the link existing between\ndiscretion and the level at which the consultant operates. As a senior consultant,\ninterviewee \u201cL\u201d has the discretion to change the approach of a project, but not\neverybody in his team has this privilege. According to him the further down you go,\nthe more discretion is limited and the more people have to stick to rules.\n\u201c\u2026I am pretty much left to run the project as I want to run it, as long as I\nstick to certain rules, I can change the approach\u2026.the more you go down\nthe level, the more the amount of discretion is restricted\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nMore than having the feeling of exercising this discretion, interviewee \u201cI\u201d argues that\ndiscretion is essential in his role. He argues that if he senses that the client is limiting\nthe amount of discretion that is given to him, he leaves the project, as a limitation of\ndiscretion would damage the efficiency of his intervention. According to interviewee\n\u201cI\u201d the level of discretion given to consultants is critical since they must have the\n62\nfreedom to conduct initial research; and the only way to do so effectively is by having\nunlimited discretion.\n\u201c...When my discretion is limited I tend to say, I don\u2019t want to work\u2026it is\ncritical, I must be able to challenge the view points that I will gain. The\nonly way I can challenge them is by doing initial research, investigations\nand interviews. I need to have that discretion to roam about the\norganisation to actually do my job...\u201d\nInterviewee I\nUnlike the level of control that was clearly perceived by business consultants, the\nlevel of discretion and the extent to which it is exercised tends to differ according to\nthe field of expertise of the consultants and the level at which they operate. As\nmentioned by interviewee \u201cL\u201d, the further up consultants operate, the more discretion\nwill be given to them.\nBalancing Between Needs\nBusiness consultants have not only the discretion to change the way they operate, but\nalso have the discretion to balance their company\u2019s needs and the client needs. This\namount of discretion has raised an issue regarding the fee involved in the consulting\nprocess. Shapiro et al (1993) argued that business consultants always try to extend the\nlength of contracts in order to get extra income. Interviewees \u201cE\u201d and \u201cG\u201d stress the\nimportance of being open and behaving ethically. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d suggests that there\nmust be consultants out there who would not adopt this approach and condemn this\nbehaviour as it emphasis the image of bad-boys that business consultants already\nsuffer from.\n\u201c\u2026I know that there are some consultants that would take that deal as\nwell, it is simply wrong. We are invariably engaged in time basis, so we\nare engaged for an estimated for an X number of days, if it takes 8 days\ninstead of 10 we only charge 8 days\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee E\n\u201c\u2026a consultant must be able to lead a project with absolute openness\nand being very ethical in his job\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee G\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d compares consultancy projects with gambling, you always take a risk\nand balancing needs is always complicated. He suggests that consultants and clients\n63\nhave two different needs, clients want a solution that works within a budget, whereas\nconsultants want the client\u2019s business and to make profit for doing the job.\nConsultants have to balance between these two needs and it can go either way.\n\u201c\u2026so it is constantly trying to balance those two things and it is not\neasy, sometimes you get it wrong and you make loose on projects and\nsometimes you get it right and you make an enormous profit\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nBusiness consultants all stress the importance of behaving ethically and always put\ntheir clients first. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d admits that it is difficult to balance these needs but\nshe suggests that if the client is happy, her organisation will get repeated work. She\nalso made a important point, suggesting that if the project comes in under budget, the\nconsultant should make sure that the clients are made aware of this fact. As\ninterviewee \u201cD\u201d argues, it is not when the project is coming in under budget that\nproblem arise, but when it comes in over budget.\n\u201c\u2026it can be difficult, however the clients\u2019 needs would almost always\ncome on top. If your client is happy, you are more likely to get repeat\nwork, if your project come under budget, do not lie about it, but shout\nabout the fact that it is coming under budget\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee D\nInterviewee \u201cK\u201d fully agrees with interviewee \u201cD\u201d and also suggests that clients\u2019\ninterests must come first.\n\u201c\u2026I think you always have to remember who pays for your wages, but\nyou are there to do a job for a client\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee K\nFinally interviewee \u201cI\u201d, recognises that it is a difficult situation for business\nconsultants working for organisations driven by billing hours. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d stresses\nthe importance of balancing well between company needs and consultant needs\nbecause under-charging can be as damaging as over-charging.\n64\n\u201c\u2026I am not driven by billing hours, those organisations are driven by\nbilling hours, the consultants they have a hard time, they do\u2026.under-\ncharging client is almost as damaging as over-charging because if you\nunder-charge an expectation may arise that you are cheap and hence they\nwill not listen\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee I\nTo conclude on this section, it was demonstrated that consultants operating at top\nmanagement level have the perception that they are exercising a high level of\ndiscretion. Concerning the question of fees, all the consultants interviewed stressed\nthe importance of behaving ethically and always put clients\u2019 interests first.\nCONSULTANT - CLIENT RELATIONSHIP\nAs demonstrated, business consultants see their role differently but share a common\ngoal: moving the client forward. However, one can argue that in order to gain a better\nunderstanding and to draw a more accurate picture, business consultants\u2019 perceptions\nof their relationship with their clients must be taken into consideration.\nIt was argued that the relationship between the consultant and his client is a crucial\nelement of the consulting process and one can question how business consultants\nperceive this relationship. It was suggested in the literature review that business\nconsultants when called in by clients can adopt different approaches. Academics such\nas Schein (1988) have argued that the consultant\/client relationship is similar to the\none existing between a doctor and his patient or that the approach is the same one as\nthe relationship existing between a teacher and his students with transferring\nknowledge being at the centre of this relationship (Schein, 1988).\nFrom the different interviews, it appears that business consultants have different\nviews of the relationship they have with their clients.\nThe above six sub-themes have emerged from the research:\n- Consultants as service providers\n- Mentor\/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship\n- Consultants as partners and supports\n- Establishing a two-way relationship\n- Building-up trust\n- Dynamics of the consultant-client relationship\n65\nConsulting Service Provider\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d feels that the approach he has to his clients does not fall into any\nsingle category. He has never considered himself as a doctor being called to find a\ncure to \u201corganisational pains\u201d or a lecturer whose main role is to transfer some sort of\nknowledge. Interviewee \u201cA\u201d has always had a client\/provider relationship in mind,\nand simply sees himself as a provider of consulting services.\n\u201c\u2026I have always had a client\/provider in mind. There are the clients I am\nthe provider and I am just providing a consultancy service\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\nWhen asked to comment on the nature of his relationship with his client, interviewee\n\u201cK\u201d suggests that it often starts off with a sort of doctor\/patient relationship in which\nhe can feel the pain of the client. However interviewee \u201cK\u201d stresses the importance of\nhaving to transfer some skills during the consultancy process. According to him, if\nclients are only given solutions to their problems and not taught how to solve their\nproblems by themselves, they will desperately need consultant\u2019s help and could\nbecome \u201caddicted\u201d to consulting services. Interviewee \u201cK\u201d in fact suggests that the\nrelationship existing between consultants and clients stands somewhere in between\nthe doctor\/patient and the teacher\/student relationship.\n\u201c\u2026It is probably a little bit of both, it starts off with the doctor \/ patients\nscenario where you can feel the pain of the client and give them the tablet\nto save them but if you give them the tablets, they are just going to come\nback\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee K\nMentor\/Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Relationship\nSome consultants do not perceive their relationship with their clients as doctor\/patient\nor teacher\/student. Interviewee \u201cH\u201d for instance would see herself as a mentor more\nthan a doctor or a teacher. One must admit that the requirements analysis stage of any\nconsulting project is similar to the diagnostic approach of the doctor but as pointed\nout by interviewee \u201cH\u201d, the doctor\/patient relationship involves the consultant\nknowing better than the client and therefore not evolving on the same level. Although\nskills are supposed to be transferred in the teacher\/student relationship, it also\ninvolves a sort of imbalance between both parties. According to interviewee \u201cH\u201d, the\n66\nrelationship between the mentor and his \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9\u201d appears closer to the\nconsultant\/client relationship.\n\u201c\u2026you may start with that doctor\/patient relationship where you are\ndoing some diagnosis\u2026perhaps as the project emerges and you are\nworking together it can change to be a little bit more like a\nstudent\/teacher but it is more about taking an equal approach\u2026it is more\nlike a mentor relationship \u2026\u201d\nInterviewee H\nTo probe deeper on what was suggested by interviewees \u201cH\u201d and \u201cK\u201d, the\nrelationship existing between consultants and clients is ambiguous. On the one hand,\nconsultants hold a specific knowledge that lacks in the client\u2019s organisation and\nconsultants can in fact being assimilated to experts or doctors. On the other hand, if\nsome sort of relevant skills are not transferred during the consultancy process, as\nsuggested by interviewee \u201cK\u201d, clients will come back on a regular basis \u201cto get their\ndrug\u201d and will can left at the mercy of the consultant. It appears that business\nconsultants stress the importance of building an equal relationship with at the centre\nof this relationship: knowledge transfer.\nConsultants As Partners and Supports\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d sees himself as having support relationship with his clients. He\nhighlights the degree of hierarchy existing in both teacher\/student and doctor\/patient\nrelationships. Although, interviewee \u201cI\u201d recognises that he may possess skills lacking\nin the client\u2019s organisation, he confesses that the client has an understanding of the\nsituation that he does not have.\n\u201c\u2026I would see myself as support, advisor, facilitative but I would hope\nthe relationship is equal. I do not try to put myself as a status above\u2026.the\nclient has an understanding of their own problems that I do not have, so I\ndefinitely try to see myself as a partner\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nInterviewees \u201cD\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d, also share the same view and see themselves as partners or\nteam members. When asked to comment on her vision of this partnership, interviewee\n\u201cD\u201d made a point worth exploring in suggesting that depending on the project, the\nrelationship can go either way. According to her, during training programmes for\ninstance, the relationship is similar to that of a teacher\/student, because consultants\n67\nhold a specific knowledge. However, when consultants are requested to talk to clients\nduring the evaluation processes, clients hold specific knowledge in this case, or at\nleast an understanding of what is going on inside the organisation. The relationship is\nin fact reversed; consultants become students. Although interviewees \u201cD\u201d and \u201cI\u201d\nwork in completely different fields, they show an interesting degree of humility in\ntheir relationship with their clients that makes an unexpected change from the rather\npejorative description made in past research.\n\u201c\u2026I would say it is more of a partnership\u2026 certainly during training\nprograms, there is a lot of a teacher \/ student relationship, but during\nevaluation, it is almost the other way round, they are almost teaching\nus\u2026overall it is more a partnership; at times it is probably 70\/30, at other\ntimes 30\/70\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nTwo-way Relationship\nConsultants interviewed agreed in saying that the relationship has to be two-way. In\nfact, some consultants suggested that the success of any consultancy project stands on\nthe ability to create a climate of trust; a way to reach such a situation is to have for a\nstart a two-way relationship.\nInterviewee \u201cF\u201d, confirms that a two-way relationship is a core element of the success\nof a consultancy project, however he argues that in his experience, his relationship\nwas too often one-way. According to interviewee \u201cL\u201d any consulting project would\nfail if the relationship is only one way. Although the consultant possesses a certain\nexperience and certain level of expertise, the consultant and his client are working\ntogether to solve an issue that the client is facing. If the client does not make any\nsuggestions or does not express himself, two problems may arise. First, the consultant\nmight be in a position in which he is forced to make decisions instead of the client.\nAlternatively, consultants can get into a situation where the client agrees with the\nprocedure that is being put in place although he or she has not fully understood it;\nwhat interviewee \u201cL\u201d calls a \u201cnodding dog symptom\u201d.\n\u201c\u2026if it is not a two-way relationship, the project will fail\u2026if it\u2019s one-way\ntraffic, you get what we call a nodding dog symptom. You get meetings\nwith people who just nod and say yes and then you get to sign on and they\nsay, no that is not what we want at all !...\u201d\nInterviewee L\n68\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d suggests that if he senses that the relationship becomes one way, he\nwould advise his client to work with another consultant. According to him, feedback\nhelps him to understand the issues that the organisation is facing, it is therefore\ncompletely impossible to move the client forward if that one lays back and does not\nget involved in the process.\n\u201c\u2026I constantly need feedback about am I helping, am I making the right\nimpact on the assumption that I have made about the client\u2019s situation\n\u2026When I begin to sense that the relationship is one way, I often advise the\nclients that they may need a different kind of consultant\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d also suggests that to be successful the relationship must be two-way.\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d perceives the relationship between clients and consultants in terms of\na journey where both parties learn from each other.\n\u201c\u2026both client and business consultant should be in a kind of \u201cjourney\ntogether\u201d, and accepting to be in a co-learning mode (which is and\nshould be demanding and challenging for both)\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee P\nThe Notion of Trust\nTo complete the analysis of business consultants\u2019 perception of their\nrelationship with their clients, interviewee \u201cM\u201d suggests that the success of a\nproject stands in the consultant\u2019s ability to build a relationship based on trust\nwith his clients. According to him, the consultant must be perceived by his\nclients neither as a doctor nor a teacher but as a trusted advisor.\n\u201c\u2026the relationship required for success is that of trusted advisor. If the\nconsultant cannot build trust with his\/her Client, then all other\nrelationships adopted will fail to deliver appropriate results\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee M\nInterviewee \u201cK\u201d has a very pragmatic view of the reason underpinning the necessity\nto build a trusting relationship with his clients. According to him, especially when\nworking internationally, once the trust of his clients is gained, he can be less\npreoccupied with formalities. Interviewee \u201cK\u201d recalls a project with a client based in\nHong Kong that could have been jeopardised by the time difference, but because he\ngained the trust of the client, they were both able to smoothly run the project from\n69\nhome without having to be preoccupied with formalities. Interviewee \u201cK\u201d provides us\nwith a simple but practical example of how trust can enhance international\ncollaborations.\n\u201c\u2026.if I can get up in the morning at home, go downstairs and turn my PC\non and ring people up, they appreciate that my kids are running around\ngetting their breakfast\u2026.Yet I am home and I do not have to worry about\nformality\u2026.I have a client in Hong Kong, I was on the phone at 02.30pm\nand it is 09.30pm their time, so they went back home, they put the kids to\nbed and then they rung me back\u2026.\u201c.\nInterviewee K\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d for instance highlights the connection between trust and getting\nrepeated work. He relates a situation where a client insisted that he or a colleague of\nhis was put in charge of implementing a particular system in the client\u2019s organisation\nsimply because the client trusted them.\n\u201c\u2026P\u2026. and I worked with a client from the beginning of last year and we\nvirtually found out that they insisted that it was one of us who did it\nbecause they had a level of trust\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d agrees with interviewee \u201cE\u201d on the necessity for the consultant to\ngain the trust of clients. According to him client\u2019s trust is extremely hard to gain but\namazingly easy to lose. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d also argues that there is a link between the\nlevel of trust between the client and the consultant, and the level of control given to\nthe consultant. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d argues that the more the client trusts the consultant,\nthe more the consultant will be left in charge of the project and be able to run it the\nway he wants.\n\u201c\u2026if you have the client\u2019s trust, they will let you being in charge within\nboundaries. As long as you respect those, you pass on decisions when they\nneed to be passed on\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee L\nThis assumption is confirmed by interviewee \u201cA\u201d who argues that he has an\n\u201cenormous\u201d level of control over the assignment and in fact over the whole\nconsultancy project, once the trust of the client is gained.\n70\n\u201c\u2026.the client is in control of course but in my experience providing\nyou\u2019ve got their trust, they just want you to go there and do it, \u201ctell us\nwhat to do\u201d or \u201ctell us when it is done\u201d. So I think we have enormous\ncontrol\u201d\nInterviewee A\nDynamics of The Consultant \u2013 Client Relationship\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d made an interesting point. According to him, there are no right or\nwrong answers, the relationship existing between consultants and clients is deeply\ninfluenced by clients\u2019 organisational culture. He suggests that on some occasions, the\nclient only wants the consultant to tell him what has to be done. The consultant is\ntherefore pushed to take the role of a lecturer. On other occasions, interview \u201cL\u201d acts\nas the facilitator. In this scenario, the client is using the consultant to facilitate the\nchange. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d provides us with an insightful example aiming at assessing\nthe relationship existing between consultants and clients. He argues that in every\nsuccessful project he was involved in, his relationship with his client was so close that\na third party from outside would not have been able to distinguish the client from the\nconsultant.\n\u201c\u2026some clients just want you to come in and basically tell them what to\ndo, you are therefore taking the role of a lecturer\u2026.if somebody would\ncome from the outside, they would not know who the client is and who the\nconsultant is. It has to be that close\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nWhereas interviewee \u201cL\u201d suggests that the relationship between consultant and client\nis greatly influenced by the culture of the client\u2019s organisation, interviewee \u201cE\u201d\nargues that the relationship would tend to change in accordance with the clients\u2019\nneeds and the client\u2019s perception of the importance of the problem. Depending on the\nclient\u2019s situation, the relationship and the level of closeness between the consultant\nand the client would fluctuate. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d argues that on some occasions when\nthe client believes that the consultant possesses a certain level of expertise in a\nparticular field, they would be perceived almost as \u201ca respected professor\u201d. It could be\nargued that since there is a perceived level of expertise, the relationship is more likely\nto be not only unequally in favour of the consultant but also that the client\u2019s\nperception influences the consultant\/client relationship. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d introduces\nhere the notion of role expectations that will be discussed later. In other situations, as\n71\nargued by interviewee \u201cE\u201d, the consultant may possess a skill that the organisation\ndoes not have, but that he is simply perceived as another employee. The organisation\nrequests the help of a consultant as it would request the help of a plumber to fix a\npipe.\n\u201c\u2026where I was yesterday, I was there as the expert. So as a professor\nalmost respected they want my advice\u2026 For the customer I am working\nfor at the moment I am simply another employee, I am a consultant\ncontractor, I could be an electrician or a plumber...\u201d\nInterviewee E\nTo conclude on this section, the relationship existing between consultants and clients\nappears difficult to define, but it can be argued that business consultants urge the\nimportance of establishing an equal relationship with their clients. It was also\ndemonstrated that business consultants perceive themselves as partners or mentors\nand stress the importance of building a sound and trusting relationship with clients.\nCONSULTANTS SKILLS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nThis section aims at ascertaining the level of responsibility that business consultants\nthink that they have over the consultancy process. Business consultants also comment\non how much they believe their clients also have responsibilities. This section also\nprovides the opportunity to highlight what the most important skills to work in\nconsulting are according to business consultants.\nThe following four sub-themes emerged from the responses and will be discussed in\nmore detail below:\n- Consultant skills\n- Business consultant responsibilities\n- Client responsibilities\n- Managing client expectations\nConsultant Skills\nThe literature review suggests that the fundamental skill to be an efficient consultant\nis problem analysis. Although consultants do not undervalue the importance of\nanalytical skills, most of them suggest that possessing solid analytical skills is not\n72\nsufficient, experience as well as a certain ability to listen to and understand problems\nin their context is necessary.\nBusiness consultants suggest that the following five skills are necessary to become an\nefficient consultant:\n- Experience\n- Functional skills\n- Ability to listen and question\n- Objectivity\n- Self-Awareness\nExperience\nInterviewees \u201cD\u201d and \u201cL\u201d suggest that experience primes over technical skills. They\nboth stress the importance of having experience and expertise in a particular field.\nAccording to them, experience combined with a solid knowledge of a particular\nindustry is what gives credibility to the eyes of their clients.\n\u201c\u2026it is not so much technical knowledge, it is much more about business\nknowledge and actually being there and done it\u2026 you have to have a\nsound business grounding or technical grounding in your field of\nexpertise otherwise people say, why shall I believe you\u2026.\u201c\nInterviewee L\nInterviewee \u201cO\u201d, a career management consultant also believes that business\nconsultants should possess a combination of both soft and industry knowledge.\nSimilarly to interviewee \u201cL\u201d, interviewee \u201cO\u201d argues that industry knowledge gives\ncredibility to the consultant. He suggests that in order to be credible, consultants\nshould possess a solid understanding of the client\u2019s businesses and understand the\nlanguage that clients use.\n\u201c\u2026I think industry knowledge and function knowledge is very valuable\nto be credible\u2026.being credible in terms of understanding the business,\nyou certainly have to understand the language they use, what are the key\nissues, who are the key players, where these businesses are going, where\nthey come from\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee O\n73\nFunctional skills\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d fully agrees with interviewee \u201cL\u201d and confirms that technical skills\nare important but not crucial. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d stresses the importance of being aware\nof one\u2019s own functional skills. He provides us once again with an insightful\nperspective in suggesting that business consultants must have the ability to adapt\nthemselves to their client\u2019s situation and be able to understand problems in their\ncontext.\n\u201c\u2026the most important skill is not only your technical skills, it is your\nability to understand or appreciate what is happening in that context, in\nthat client\u2019s situation\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nListening and Questioning\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d and \u201cH\u201d have different opinions. According to them, questioning and\nlistening are the vital functions of the consultancy process. Since working in fields\nsuch as Change Management and Personal Development and having to interview\npeople to \u201cextract\u201d a specific knowledge from them, it appears logical that the ability\nto talk and listen to people is a core element of their role. Interviewee \u201cH\u201d relates an\nanecdote in which her lack of attention during an initial meeting led to a\nmisunderstanding.\n\u201c.. It is about listening and being able to answer right questions... I had\nan initial meeting with a client where I have gone away thinking that I\nhad a clear idea, so I did a presentation and gave some ideas and it was\ntotally wrong\u2026 Listening is really important... \u201d\nInterviewee H\nObjectivity\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d and \u201cP\u201d argue that the most important skill when working as a\nbusiness consultant would be the ability to remain objective, even if in some cases\nbeing objective means going against one\u2019s company interests. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d for\ninstance has had the opportunity to be involved in a wide range of projects and tends\nto criticise consultants who are focused on recommending solutions that fit into their\nfield of competence, or consultants who simply please clients in telling them exactly\nwhat they want to hear.\n74\n\u201c\u2026you need to be able to set aside your company, set aside their\ncompany, take in the information, process it and make the best\nrecommendations. I have recommended solutions that are not things that I\ndo, I have recommended solutions in the past that we as a company do not\ndo because it is the right thing to do for the customer\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\n\u201c\u2026I sometimes clearly state that I will not be able to match some\nnamed expectations, because I either feel that I am not the most competent\nfor these, in those cases I offer to link with other colleagues, or with\nexternal consultants I know\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee P\nInterviewee \u201cO\u201d on the other hand stresses the importance of knowing one\u2019s\nlimitation and remaining objective regarding one\u2019s scope of intervention.\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019ve got to have a good working knowledge but also to know what\nyour limitations are and you need to know when to pull up your hand; this\nis beyond my expertise\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee O\nSelf-awareness\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d suggests that being able to self-question is an important skill that\nbusiness consultants must possess in order to succeed. Interviewee \u201cN\u201d, an executive\ncoach fully agrees and argues that before asking clients to reflect upon their role,\nconsultants must have gone through a deep study of themselves.\n\u201c\u2026You also need a lot of self-awareness you need to study yourself at a\ndeeper level. If you ask people to look inside themselves and you have not,\nit\u2019s not going to work...\u201d\nInterviewee N\nThe following statements confirmed what was argued in the literature review,\nbusiness consultancy is a very complex role to define. Business consultancy is a wide\nfield and there are numerous different types of consultants. Although there are\nsimilarities across the different fields, one could argue that the skills needed might not\nbe the same when working as an IT consultant compared to a finance consultant. In\naddition, the level of expertise and the mastering of certain skills fluctuates in\ncomparison to the level at which consultants operate. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d mentioned an\nelement of information that is worth exploring. According to him, there are a variety\n75\nof skills that must be grasped in order to become an efficient consultant, but he goes\nas far as mentioning the existence of a specific skill, a sort of \u201cgift\u201d specific to the\nconsulting industry; a \u201cnatural consulting skill\u201d.\n\u201c...you have to have what I call natural consulting skills, natural selling\nskills almost like a theatrical post because you are selling all the time\u2026 it\nis like being a musician, most people can play badly but it is the people\nwho are good who can become excellent who are very interesting\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nBusiness Consultants\u2019 Responsibilities\nIt appears from our analysis that business consultants are very much aware of the\nlevel of control and discretion they have in their role. They have also been given the\nopportunity to comment on their vision of the relationship that they have with their\nclients. However, one cannot draw an accurate picture about how business consultants\nperceive their role if they are not asked to express their perception of the\nresponsibilities that they have towards their clients.\nConfidentiality\nBusiness consultants have different responsibilities towards their clients. First of all,\nthey have the responsibility to assure a total confidentiality during the data gathering\nstage. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d suggests that the consultant has a responsibility not to lie to\nclients when trying to acquire a particular piece of information. The consultant must\nassure that the anonymity of the interviewee is respected.\n\u201c\u2026we have a responsibility that if you tell your client that this\ninformation is not going to get back to their boss, then it does not get back\nto their boss\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d also suggests that a failure to do this would not only affect the\nrelationship existing between the consultant and his clients or clients\u2019 employees, but\nalso increase the \u201cbad guy\u201d image that consultants already suffer from. When asked\nthe same question, interviewee \u201cF\u201d made exactly the same comment and stressed the\nimportance of getting a message across to the employees of clients\u2019 organisations:\nconsultants are not axe men.\n76\n\u201c\u2026you are dealing with people, knowledge that they often think is their\nadvantage in the business, they do not always want to give you that\nknowledge because that is what keeping them in the job\u2026. \u201c\nInterviewee D\n\u201c\u2026from my experience, we always tried to show that we are not job-\nkillers, we are not the spin doctors, and we are not know-everything-the\nbest machines\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee F\nInterviewee \u201cH\u201d on the other hand suggests that consultants must be cautious about\nwhom they share information with. Business consultants have a responsibility to\nassure a total confidentiality to employees on the client site but also to their clients.\n\u201c\u2026.When you are working with senior people, they are talking about\nthings that can have an impact on people within the organisation and of\ncourse you can\u2019t divulge on that kind of information, so you have to be\ncautious about who you share the information with\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee H\nTransfer of Skills Consultants to Clients\nIt was argued in the literature review that one of the responsibilities when working as\na business consultant is to transfer skills to clients during the consultancy process. The\naim of this section is to ascertain whether business consultants believe that they\ntransfer some of their skills during the consultancy process.\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d suggests that when projects run smoothly, he can definitely feel that\nsome of his skills are transferred to his clients. This assumption is confirmed by\ninterviewee \u201cD\u201d, who argues that transferring skills is the major aim of the\nconsultancy process. She suggests that consulting is not \u201cdoing something to\nsomebody but with somebody\u201d, skills must be transferred throughout the project. It is\nnot good enough to implement or develop a new system if clients are not able to run it\nby themselves. Business consultants have in fact the responsibility to teach their\nclients how to get the best benefits from the system that have been put in place.\nHowever, interviewee \u201cD\u201d confesses that she obviously does not teach her clients\neverything she knows, for copyright reasons first of all but also because she would not\nget hired anymore by the client.\n77\n\u201c....transferring the skills is the major aim\u2026 It is not doing something to\nsomebody, it is doing it with them\u2026you need to show how to get the best\nbenefit from it\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d also feels that skills are transferred to clients especially when\ntechnical solutions are delivered, i.e. SAP type projects. As mentioned by interviewee\n\u201cL\u201d, it is crucial that clients are able to run the system, otherwise they will end-up\ncalling the consultant every week and become as argued earlier on \u201caddicted to\nconsulting services\u201d. In transferring skills clients also feel that they getting more\nvalue and in fact get to trust the consultant more easily.\n\u201c\u2026if you don\u2019t do that skill transfer they are going to come to you every\nweeks\u2026 you are giving them more value and because they have that trust\nin you, when they have a real problem, they are going to ask you about\nthe real problem\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d gives another perspective on the nature of the skills transfer.\nAccording to him, transferring skills is not only transferring technical skills, it can\nalso mean helping the client to adopt a different approach or rethink the way they\noperate. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d highlights the frustration of such a process in suggesting that\nit does not happen very quickly.\n\u201c\u2026the frustration is that it does not happen very quickly. It is a very slow\nprogressive process\u2026the transfer may be in skills, but also just in new\nways of thinking\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nManaging Clients\u2019 Expectations\nMeeting Clients\u2019 Expectations\nBusiness consultants feel that they are fulfilling client\u2019s expectations. Interviewee\n\u201cF\u201d, for instance insists on the fact that consulting companies are also brand names.\nTo survive within such a competitive environment consulting organisations have to\nretain their customers. Interviewee \u201cF\u201d who worked for a major consultancy company\nsuggests that the well established consultancies usually fulfil the expectations of their\nclients\n78\n\u201c\u2026Consulting companies are also brand names. That is why when a\nclient goes to xxx, or xxx he expects a good quality of advice. The well-\nestablished consultancies usually fulfil a client\u2019s expectations\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee F\nInterviewee \u201cN\u201d argues that it is her responsibility to set the expectations. If at the\nbeginning of the process, she senses that clients have completely unrealistic\nexpectations, she feels that it is her responsibility to re-assess those expectations.\nHowever, since working as an executive coach, interviewee \u201cN\u201d suggests that client\ndisappointment can occur when the expectations have not been set properly or are\ncompletely unrealistic.\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s my role to set the expectations, so If I set them properly there\nare no problems. There are times where organisations can be\ndisappointed, people often expect in coaching that you can create a new\npersonality\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee N\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d also feels that he fulfils his clients\u2019 expectations. According to him,\nthe consultant and the client go through a process of listening and talking during\nwhich they agree on what the expectations are and what the outcomes should be.\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d argues that in addition to doing a quality assurance survey with his\nclient, the fact that that he gets repeated business shows that he has fulfilled the\nexpectations. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d ironically suggests that consultants rapidly find out if\nthey have not fulfilled clients\u2019 expectations.\n\u201c\u2026you very quickly find out if things are not going right\u2026 the client\nwould tell you or the client would tell your boss and your boss will\ndefinitely tell you\u2026(laugh)\u201d\nInterviewee L\nOn a more serious tone, interviewee \u201cL\u201d explained that in order to fulfil clients\u2019\nexpectations and to successfully carry out assignments, consulting staff\u2019s objectives\nare aligned with the client\u2019s team objectives, in other words they share the same goals.\nBoth consulting team and client team are also appraised on the same basis to make\nsure that both teams are committed to success.\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d stresses the importance of trying to determine up front what exactly\nthe client wants to achieve and what they can realistically expect to achieve.\n79\nInterviewee \u201cJ\u201d argues that clients should always be happy with the outcome of a\nproject. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d recalls a particular project that did not run quite as smoothly\nas it could have done, the project ran over-budget and several employees have had to\njoin the consulting team to finish off the job. Although, the project did not go as well\nas planned, the client appreciated the fact that she and her team have worked hard to\nsuccessfully complete the project. The client called them several months later to do\nanother piece of work for the same organisation.\n\u201c\u2026 we finished off over-budget and we had to put some extra men in the\nend to finish the project\u2026.however the client came back to us to do a\nmajor piece of work. The fact to have managed the expectations, finished\noff the job and not stabbed them in the back for it, paid off \u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nAs demonstrated in the literature review, management of expectations is crucial in\nbusiness consultancy and consultants feel that sometimes clients can be responsible\nfor project failures because of their inability to articulate their expectations clearly.\n\uf0b7 Unrealistic Expectations\nInterviewees \u201cA\u201d and \u201cD\u201d both suggest that sometimes clients have completely\nunrealistic expectations and are not willing to accept that there is nothing that\nconsultants can do in this case. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d remembers a client who unhappy\nabout the system that was being put in place and was blaming her team. Interviewee\n\u201cD\u201d tried to get the client to understand that there was nothing wrong with the system\nbut with the data.\n\u201c\u2026I am working with a client at the minute, that had some really\nunrealistic expectations of a system that has just been implemented and is\nnot happy at all with the system, but there is nothing wrong with the\nsystem, it is their data which is wrong and we can\u2019t do anything about\nthat\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nInterviewees \u201cE\u201d and \u201cL\u201d both feel that it is their responsibility to make sure that\nclient expectations are always realistic. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d argues that poor expectations\nmanagement is what creates conflicts between consultants and clients. He suggests\nthat clients often have unrealistic expectations concerning time-scales, but it is the\n80\nconsultant\u2019s job to re-adjust those expectations even if the go-live date has to be\npushed back.\n\u201c\u2026What cause the discord between consultants and clients is that they\nexpect everything to be delivered in an unrealistic time scale and the\nworst thing you can do is not to push back \u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\n\uf0b7 Unclear idea of what is wanted\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d suggests that on some occasions, clients do not know what they want\nfrom the consultant and sometimes ask for something but finish wanting something\nelse. On some occasions, because the client\u2019s environment has changed or their\nstrategy has changed, their expectations have also changed but the consultant has not\nbeen advised.\n\u201c\u2026.the trouble arises when they ask for one thing and get a\nconfirmation that it was what they wanted and not only they end up\nwanting something else but claiming that they wanted something\nelse\u2026and the reason for this is that things have changed in their business\nbut they do not tell you\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\nBusiness consultants agree on saying that most of the time clients do not have a clear\nidea of what the role of business consultants is, or even why they need the help of a\nconsultant. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d suggests that on countless occasions, clients did not\nknow why they wanted that particular IT system, not even clear on what they wanted\nto achieve. It begs the question how someone can expect achieve a certain result if\nthey do not know precisely what they want.\n\u201c\u2026Often they do not even have a clear idea of what it is they are asking\nyou to implement for them, why they need it or what are the benefits\u2026.the\nnumber of people that have come to me and said, I want this !! Why do\nyou want it ? My boss told me or that company which is our competitor\nthey\u2019ve got it, so we should have it !!\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nInterviewees \u201cK\u201d and \u201cB\u201d confirmed the point made by interviewee \u201cD\u201d; clients often\ndo not have a clear idea of the role of business consultants. They both suggested that\nclients sometimes think that business consultants are \u201clittle fairies\u201d who can solve\norganisational issues simply by waving their magic wands.\n81\n\u201c\u2026half of them always suspect for you to walk in and wave your magic\nwand and everything will be OK\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee K\n\uf0b7 Clients\u2019 unclear idea: the first step of the consultancy process\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d on the other hand tends to disagree with the above statements and\nexpects clients to have different views of his role. He suggests that those different\nviews reflect the tensions in the organisation and actually help him to start his analysis\nand help in moving the client forward. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d sees that lack of clarity as a\nfirst step.\n\u201c\u2026I would tend to criticise many consultants who say that their clients do\nnot have a clear role of them, my view would be that your clients should\nnot have a clear role because all they want you to do is to help and what\nyou begin to do is identify the various tensions. .. I don\u2019t see that as a\nproblem, I simply see it as the first step to help\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nManaging Clients\u2019 Hidden Agendas\nBusiness consultants argue that clients\u2019 hidden agendas can serve various purposes.\nOn some occasions business consultants can be used or manipulated.\nThree sub-themes emerged from the data analysis.\n- Clients using business consultants as tools\n- Clients using business consultants as scapegoats\n- Client manipulation of consultants\n\uf0b7 Clients Using Consultants As \u201cTools\u201d\nInterviewee \u201cM\u201d suggests that sometimes consultants are the perfect scapegoats and\ncan be perceived by clients as \u201ctools\u201d.\n\u201c\u2026Consultants can be engaged as a tool for furthering inappropriate\naims, rather than objectively helping with an assignment\/initiative\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee M\nWhen interviewing interviewee \u201cP\u201d, he made a comment about the change of current\nassessment. According to him there is currently a tendency from managing directors\nor chief executives to use consultants as an alibi. Interviewee\u2019s \u201cA\u201d experiences\nconfirm this assumption.\n82\n\u201c\u2026there is a willingness of some CEOs and managing directors to\n\u201duse\u201d Business consultants as an alibi , as a cosmetic short term use\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee P\n\uf0b7 Clients Using Consultants As Scapegoats\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d recalls an assignment where he was hired by a Human Resources\nDepartment to produce a report stating that a particular employee had to be dismissed.\nIn this particular anecdote, the consultant was used to carry out the task which was\nrequired by some of the higher management of the organisation.\n\u201c\u2026in my experience and at least one occasion, a very significant reason\nwhy I was taking on to a job was so that they could get rid of somebody. I\ndo not think that was 100% of it, but it was clearly one of their objective\nof hiring any consultants\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\n\uf0b7 Manipulation: A Common Practice\nWhen talking about such practices with interviewee \u201cI\u201d, he suggested that it is in fact\ncommon practice. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d confessed that every situation he has gone into had\na political side. However, he argues that he does not see political agendas as a\nproblem but as a normal element of the consulting process. Since interviewee \u201cI\u201d\ndeals with strategic issues at top-management level, he always comes across political\nissues.\n\u201c\u2026every situation I\u2019ve gone into has a politic side. The CE brings you in,\nsays there is a team problem, actually he may have a problem with\nsomebody. It is my job to discover that. I don\u2019t see the political agenda as\na problem, I see it as a normal element of the way I operate\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\nWhen asked for the reasons underpinning such a phenomenon, no matter what their\nfield of competence and their level of experience, consultants have heard anecdotal\nstories about such practices or even found themselves in such a situation. Interviewee\n\u201cL\u201d confesses that he has already been in a situation where his client played him off\nagainst other departments in order to get him to solve their internal dispute. Even\nworse, some clients have tried to play him off against members of his own team in\norder to catch him out and check if the consulting team was working towards the\nsame goal.\n83\n\u201c\u2026clients sometimes are playing you off against each other\u2026they will\ncall maybe the project manager and express their opinion, they will then\ncall in the project team, ask them the same question, they might give a\ndifferent answer\u2026 So they are trying to catch you out\u2026 sometimes the\nclient\u2019s team play you off differently, so the IT director might play you off\nagainst the Finance director and you end-up managing their internal\ndispute\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee L\nTo conclude on consultants\u2019 views of clients\u2019 hidden agendas, interviewee \u201cE\u201d also\nhas several anecdotes. He was once asked to do some knowledge management\ninvestigations in a organisation, but later found out that he had actually been hired to\nintroduce the company\u2019s new knowledge management project. The organisation knew\nthat there would have been resistance from employees and that is the reason why they\nwanted someone external to do it for them.\n\u201c\u2026the whole purpose of why they wanted us to do the knowledge\ninvestigation was to introduce their knowledge management project, they\nalready knew what they wanted to do but they did not want to be\nseen\u2026.they simply knew that there would be resistance in the\norganisation\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\nAs demonstrated, clients can on some occasions try to manipulate business\nconsultants, but interviewee \u201cN\u201d mentioned an element of information that is worth\nexploring. Although she does not deny clients\u2019 manipulation attempts, her experience\nproved to her that it is not intended in the majority of cases. Interviewee \u201cN\u201d argues\nthat sometimes manipulation attempts are the result of group dynamics.\n\u201c\u2026Manipulation implies that it is conscious but in my experience it\nhappened that unconsciously, it\u2019s just group dynamic\u2026.a lot of it, it is not\nintended, it\u2019s not meant to cause harm\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee N\nClient Responsibilities\nThroughout this section, we have tried to determine what is, according to business\nconsultants, their part of responsibility over consultancy projects. It appears from the\ncriticisms that project failure is systematically attributed to business consultants but\none can question whether clients also play an important part in the success of\nconsultancy projects.\n84\nBusiness consultants suggest that clients do have at least one responsibility:\n- Complying with consultants\u2019 requirements\nCommon Sense Responsibilities\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d argues that of course business consultants have responsibilities\ntowards their clients, but clients also have responsibilities and must comply with the\ndifferent procedural requirements. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d suggests that if the procedure\nrequires interviews of key people within the organisation, it is their responsibility to\narrange the interviews and make sure that interviewees will willingly participate.\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d recalls several projects when time and money was wasted because of\nthe client\u2019s lack of organisation. On one particular occasion, interviewee \u201cE\u201d drove to\nhis client\u2019s site to find out that he did not have a desk or access to the IT system,\nalthough this meeting had been planned well in advance and the requirements made\nclear. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d also recalls a particular project where his morning meeting\nwith a manager had been cancelled a few days in advance but nobody in the client\u2019s\nsite had bothered telling him. The following day, he had a meeting with the plant\nmanager, who had not been briefed about the project and did not know that he was\nsupposed to be interviewed.\n\u201c\u2026.They have to make the team available for interviewing and they have\nto be made available in a willing sense\u2026I did not have a desk, I didn\u2019t\nhave an ID for the IT system and there was nothing I could do\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\nROLE PROS AND CONS\nRole Pros\nSince business consultants are perceived as a much maligned group of people, we\nwere keen to discover what business consultants like and dislike in such a polemical\nrole. As expected in any situation involving the expression of a preference or an\nopinion, consultants have different views on what they like and dislike about their\nrole.\n85\nWhen talking to business consultants about what makes their role interesting, the\nfollowing five sub-themes emerged from the discussion:\n- Lack of routine and boredom\n- Contact with clients\n- Contribution to organisational welfare\n- Intellectual challenge\n- Transfer of knowledge clients \/ consultants\nLack of Routine and Boredom\nInterviewees \u201cL\u201d and \u201cF\u201d agree on saying that it is the absence of routine that makes\nthe role of a business consultant interesting. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d expresses himself on this\nmatter and referred to his own experience. Prior to becoming a business consultant, he\nused to work as a line manager, a role that he left because of the \u201cday-to-day routine\u201d\nand repetitiveness. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d particularly enjoys the fact that since working as a\nbusiness consultant he gets to work on different projects, with different teams on a\nregular basis.\n\u201c...I got bored with the day-to-day routine\u2026.what I find in consulting is\nthat the longest you are with a client is at the maximum 2 years\u2026so you\nalways see different clients, different people and that is the exciting part\nof the role.... you are not chained to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu tasks\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee L\nContact With Clients\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d, an IT consultant has a different view on what she likes in her role\nand considers herself lucky. She suggests that in the kind of consultancy that she is\ndoing she gets to work with clients right from the beginning through to the finished\nproduct. Her role enables her to be in contact with different clients on different sites.\n\u201c\u2026I get to see people right from the pre-sale opportunity through to the\nfinished piece of work which is good. And I like to have contact with\ncustomers as well. I cannot imagine anything worse than being stuck in\nthe back office\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\nContribution to Organisation\u2019s Welfare\nHaving completed a major piece of work and having actually helped a client solving\nan organisational issue provides a certain feeling of satisfaction for consultants.\n86\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d for example suggests that what he likes the most is realising that he\nactually contributed to an organisation\u2019s welfare.\n\u201c...what turns me on is doing something that makes a difference and as a\nresult of doing that, the organisation is better\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\nIntellectual Challenge\nInterviewee \u201cE\u201d likes to feel that the consultancy had a positive impact on the client\u2019s\norganisation. He goes even as far as suggesting that he gets a slight feeling of pride\nwhen a project has run smoothly. Coming from a scientific background, interviewee\n\u201cE\u201d ultimately enjoys solving complicated issues, what interviewee \u201cJ\u201d calls the\n\u201cintellectual challenge\u201d. According to interviewee \u201cE\u201d, it is not so much about clients\nasking him to be part of the implementation process but the fact that his advice gets\nfollowed up that procures him with a feeling of satisfaction.\n\u201c\u2026I guess it is about problems solving ultimately\u2026it is about the analysis\nand then resolution of problems\u2026.I guess the good part of that being\nwhen people take your recommendations with you or not\u2026.it is nice to be\nable to say that you can say for certain that some benefits were done\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee E\nTransfer of Knowledge Clients to Consultants\nBusiness consultant recognise that transferring skills is an important factor in the\nconsultancy process. However, they all recognise that the consultancy process is not a\none way process where only the consultant brings in new skills to clients. Consultants\nhave the feeling of gaining not so much skills, but valuable knowledge from their\nclients.\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d argues that if he does not feel as though he is gaining any knowledge\nfrom his clients, he would be tempted to question the efficiency of intervention.\nAccording to him, not learning during the consulting process would simply mean that\nhe is not being challenged and becomes \u201cdisconnected\u201d from client\u2019s situation.\n\u201c\u2026not learning would mean that I am duplicating\/repeating things I\nhave already done in the past. If so, it would mean that I am getting\ndisconnected from the very specific reality of the client in front of me\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee P\n87\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d does not feel as though he gains specific skills from working with\nclients, on the other hand, clients enable him to increase his knowledge of a particular\nindustry and therefore contributes to his personal development.\n\u201c\u2026I think I get a lot of knowledge from working with some clients\u2026you\nmight pick up a bit, but I mainly get knowledge rather than skills\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\nInterviewee \u201cO\u201d, feels that he is constantly learning from his clients and suggests that\nthe knowledge he gains from working with clients is part of a \u2018recycling of knowledge\nand information\u2019. According to him, the gain can be of various types, it could well be\nin new techniques or new insights.\n\u201c\u2026All the time and in fact it is part of our recycling of knowledge and\ninformation. I am constantly extracting it from clients, the recycling can\ncome in different forms. It may be insights that we gain, techniques that\nthey use, literature that they read\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee O\n\uf0b7 Personal Development\nInterviewee \u201cH\u201d also argues that working with different people and projects not\nonly increases her knowledge of how organisations operate but also contributes\nto her personal development.\n\u201c\u2026you can\u2019t help to be slightly different at the end of a project because\nyou have been working with different people and there is something about\nlearning about yourself as well...\u201d\nInterviewee H\n\uf0b7 Technical Skills\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d, because of her role as an IT consultant, works mainly between\nmanagers and technical staff. This position allows her to improve both her\nmanagement and negotiation skills and also enables her to become familiar with\nsystems that she has not come across with in the past that she can potentially develop\nfor other clients.\n\u201c\u2026not every single project goes 100% smoothly and you learn how to do\nthings better\u2026because I am working for an IT consultancy, you are often\nlearning technical skills as well...\u201d\nInterviewee D\n88\nThe very pragmatic interviewee \u201cE\u201d suggests that consultants are called in, in the\nmajority of cases because clients discovered how not to do something. Therefore it\ncan be argued that consultants do not only learn how to do things better, but also learn\nhow not to do things. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d on the other hand suggests that learning about a\nparticular industry or sector is useful again to gain the credibility of other clients. He\nalso suggests that consultants can also learn best practices because not all clients do\nthings badly.\n\u201c\u2026and frequently you are in there because they have discovered how not\nto do it. there is always something that you are going to learn, even if it is\nhow not to do it\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\n\u201c\u2026not all of the clients do things badly actually, some clients do things\nvery well and you can take that and apply to other people\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\nRole Cons\nIt seems that there is a variety of aspects that makes the role of business consultant an\nexciting one. Variety in both projects and type of clients also in addition to personal\ndevelopment, however as one can expect, as in any role, business consultancy has its\ndownsides.\nSeven main downsides in the role of business consultants have been identified from\nthe data analysis process:\n- Long Hours\n- Uncertainty\n- Bureaucracy\n- Lack of top-management support\n- Current trend of \u201cassessment\u201d\n- Role ambiguity\n- Dealing with criticisms\nLong Hours\nThe role of business consultant appears to be extremely intense in terms of hours\nworked. Interviewee \u201cF\u201d, although enjoying certain aspect of the life of a business\nconsultant suggests that working between 60 and 70 hours per week does not leave\n89\nhim much time for his private life. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d dislikes being away from home\nmost of the time and not being able to spend more time with his young family. He\nalso suggests that being away from home so much prevents him from building a social\nlife. He frankly admits that most of his \u201csocial network\u201d is through work.\n\u201cMy job involves me being away from home probably most of the\ntime\u2026most of my social networks is through work\u2026.that\u2019s the bit you can\nsuffer when doing this job and you have to be prepared to do it, it is quite\na big thing\u201d\nInterviewee L\nUncertainty\nInterviewee \u201cJ\u201d on the other hand, does not mind so much working late but dislikes\nthe uncertainty of the role of a business consultant. According to him, consultants are\nconstantly judged by how busy they appear to be. Also the fact of working for a large\nmultinational organisation that can potentially make redundancies at any time creates\na climate of uncertainty. It was argued earlier on, that uncertainty is a major aspect of\nthe life of managers, but it seems that this feeling is also shared by business\nconsultants.\n\u201c\u2026I dislikes the fact that consultants are always judged by how busy\nthey are\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee J\nInterviewee \u201cB\u201d a freelance coach also particularly dislikes the uncertainty of her\nrole. She suggests that even after several years of experience, she is still uncertain\nregarding the demand for coaching services. She argues that her role does not enable\nher to plan her workload more than six months ahead since she does not know\nwhether the organisations that she is currently working with will still need her\nexpertise in the next few months.\n\u201c\u2026even after four years, I can\u2019t yet say, I\u2019ve got enough work to keep\nme going for the next three or four years. Within six months or one years,\neverything can change. Sometimes you\u2019ve got good contacts with some\norganisations and suddenly they might not be willing to work with you\nanymore, or the organisation stops its activity or simply they just don\u2019t\nneed you anymore\u2026.\u201d\nInterviewee B\n90\nBureaucracy\nBureaucracy, both within consultant and client organisations, as well as getting\napprovals from different lines of management is a particular aspect of the role of a\nbusiness consultant that is most disliked by interviewee \u201cD\u201d. She argues that\nbureaucracy acts as a barrier and slows processes down and can even sometimes stop\nprojects from going ahead.\n\u201c\u2026bureaucracy within organisations is always a barrier, both within\nyour own organisation and your client\u2019s organisation. It is the kind of\nthing that stops projects from going ahead, slows projects down. And I do\nthink that too many lines of management can be a real pain to both the\nconsultant and business people\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee D\nInterviewees \u201cD\u201d and \u201cK\u201d both converge to the same conclusion, bureaucracy slows\nprojects down, but Interviewee \u201cK\u201d adopts a more pragmatic approach to these\nbarriers and argues that bureaucracy is a phenomenon that is not particular to the\nconsulting industry. What he dislikes the most of all is to do with \u201cpeople not pulling\ntheir weight\u201d rather than things specific to the role of business consultant.\n\u201c\u2026I dislike the same things that you tend to get in any role, the kind of\nbureaucracy, people not pulling their weight. It is all the things that has to\ndo with people not especially with the role\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee K\nLack of Top Management Support\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d dislikes that on some occasions, he does not get the top-management\nsupport needed to address the real issues. According to him, clients are not willing to\nface up to their problems and address the real issues and as a result of this, his\nrecommendations are not taken into account.\n\u201c\u2026sometimes in my experience, the client does not want to address the\nreal issues, sometimes although they are addressing the real issues, you\ndon\u2019t really get top level support, that means whatever is proposed is not\ngoing to actually happen\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\n91\nCurrent Trend of Assessment\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d, particularly dislikes what he refers to as \u201cthe current trend of\nassessment\u201d. According to him, there are more and more requests of \u201cstandardization\u201d\nversus building on diversity from organisations. Interviewee \u201cP\u201d also dislikes the fact\nthat nowadays more and more organisations have too strong a concern to please\nmainly the shareholders versus considering creating value for multiple stakeholders.\nInterviewee \u201cP\u201d argues that nowadays the organisational environment changes so\nquickly that organisation are more preoccupied with better short term results rather\nthan developing people for long term gain.\n\u201c\u2026organisations want more and more to quickly assess their people,\ntheir teams, their organisations, to promote, select, downsize for better\nshort term results. Versus developing people, building with a longer term\nand sustainable approach, and focused to a broader set of results\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee P\nRole Ambiguity\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d, although adopting a relativistic approach to the consulting process\nagrees with interviewee \u201cA\u201d and has also experienced situations in which clients were\nafraid to face up to their problems. He also highlights the ambiguous character of the\nrole of business consultants, who when investigating a particular issue can discover\nanother one that clients might not be prepared to face. In addition, interviewee \u201cI\u201d\ndislikes being blamed for internal problems that are beyond his scope of intervention.\n\u201c\u2026The work is ambiguous because you can have a client who comes to\nyou with on need, then you discover another need and they may not want\nto face up to that\u2026.the only thing I do not like that much is when the\nclient blames for problems inside and it is not your fault\u2026.but again\nthat\u2019s relatively normal\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee I\nDealing With Criticisms\nBefore commencement of this research, it was assumed that having to deal with\ncriticisms and other pejorative ideas must be an important downside of the role of a\nbusiness consultant, but it appears that consultants are very much aware of these\ncriticisms and do not deny them at all. Business consultants recognise that some\npractices of some consultants are not very ethical and agree by saying that to a certain\nextent some criticisms can be justified.\n92\nThe following six sub-themes emerged from the interviews:\n- Lack of experience\n- Standardised solutions\n- Package\n- Arrogance\n- Lack of innovation\n- Esoteric language\nSince interviewee \u201cE\u201d worked on both client and consulting sides, his views are\nparticularly relevant to our analysis. Prior to become an IT consultant, interviewee\n\u201cE\u201d worked as a chemist in the laboratories of a large multinational. He recalls that\nwhen working as a scientist he had a very low opinion of some of the consultants he\nhad to deal with.\n\u201c\u2026I can certainly understand why some customers have a low opinion of\nconsultants. I have been on the customer\u2019s side and I had a very low\nopinion of some consultants\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee E\n\uf0b7 Lack of Experience\nOne of the main criticism concerns the lack of experience of some consultants who\nare thrown into the arena selling advice with relatively little experience. As most of\nthe consultants interviewed had been in the consulting business for several years and\nhad the opportunity to deal with big projects, it was interesting to hear their comments\nabout younger consultants.\nWhen talking about the fundamental skills to become an efficient business consultant,\ninterviewee \u201cD\u201d made a point about experience. She believes that experience is what\ngives credibility in the eyes of clients, but also is what makes a good consultant.\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d tends to slightly criticise young consultants who have just come out\nof university and never worked in industry.\n\u201c\u2026you can\u2019t really advise people what to do or understand how business\nworks unless you have worked in business\u2026 there are lots of consultants\nout there who have not actually carried out business roles and who get\ndirectly into business consultancy and it makes me wonder how they carry\nout their jobs\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee D\n93\nInterviewee \u201cA\u201d fully agrees with the point made by interviewee \u201cD\u201d. It was argued\nin the introduction section that there are more and more people who currently\nproclaim themselves as consultants. Interviewee \u201cA\u201d agrees with the idea that there\nhas been a tarnishing of the term consultant, but suggests that criticisms also arise\nfrom the fact that some consulting companies charge a great deal of money to send\npeople with relatively little experience.\n\u201c\u2026it is partly the expansion but a lot of people charge a lot of money for\nwhat they produce and send people with relatively little experience\u2026.you\nget basically kids who come out of University with a MBA telling people\nwhat to do at \u00a35,000 a day\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\n\uf0b7 Standardised Solutions\nThroughout this research, it was demonstrated that anaphors and metaphors are used\nto describe the role of business consultants. One of them reflects the scepticism about\nconsultants and what they do; business consultants are perceived as people who\n\u2018borrow your watch to tell you what time it is\u2019 (Lindon, 1995: 23). This famous\nanaphor reflects the frustration experienced by clients who have the impression that\nconsultants told them what their problems were, things that they already knew but did\nnot get any relevant answers or solutions.\n\u201c\u2026I think there is a lot of scepticism about consultants and what they do:\nA man who borrows your watch to tell you the time is widely held to be\ntrue\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee A\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d argues that this assumption is partly due to the fact that in most\nconsulting projects, the amount of time is limited and billing hours is a critical\nconsideration. In fact, consultants have a restricted amount of time (restricted by both\nconsulting companies and clients) to understand problems inside the organisation.\nInterviewee \u201cI\u201d argues that in any situation, the people who can talk better about the\nproblems are those who are at the heart of the problem. If a consultant is willing to\nunderstand organisational issues from the inside, he will have to spend a long time\ntalking to people before being able to objectively make recommendations, but because\nof time constraints, consultants only restrict their analysis to what they know.\n94\n\u201c\u2026If you look at the problems existing in your family, how come a doctor\nfrom outside understand a problem better than you? They will have to\nspend a lot of time with you to understand it\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\n\uf0b7 Package\nIt was argued in the literature review that business consultants are \u201cfashion-setters\u201d\nwho sell and re-sell the same packages (Abrahamson, 1991). Interviewee \u201cI\u201d agrees\nwith this criticism and argues that large consulting organisations are now\nexperiencing the pressure of competition that a mature market brings. In fact, large\norganisations cannot afford to be flexible in their income streams and must adopt a\nmore rigid structure in order to assure the same level of income. A way to become\nmore rigid is to offer \u201cpackaged solutions\u201d because it is faster to implement. The idea\nof the consultant who gave to the client what he was about to give in any case is in\nfact widely held to be true.\n\u201c\u2026You do not know when the client is going to come, you do not know\nhow the job is going to be, you can not afford to be more flexible and you\nmust have a more structured income stream\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee I\n\uf0b7 Arrogance\nInterviewee \u201cL\u201d confesses that sometimes, consultants can be perceived as arrogant,\nnot because their role made them arrogant, but because they are experts in their field\nand they know best practices and might have done similar things dozens of times. The\nidea of consultants being \u201cknow-it-all\u201d comes from the fact that experienced\nconsultants do know how to implement numerous systems and can sometimes not\nexplain clearly or simply why a particular methodology rather than another was\nadopted.\n\u201c\u2026.when you are bringing best practises, experience to the table, you are\nsaying we should do the deal this way and they say why do you do that;\nbecause it is the best way to do it and they thing you are arrogant. You\nare not arrogant; you are trying to convince them that it is the best way to\ndo it\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee L\n95\n\uf0b7 Lack of Innovation\nThe lack of innovation is another major criticism. Interviewee \u201cH\u201d for example\nsuggests that it can be relatively easy for consultants to be drowned in a client\u2019s\norganisation and become part of the problem. The consultant who has build up a good\nrelationship with his client can feel too comfortable and might not be willing to\nchallenge his client or even himself. In that situation, client expectations are not met\nbecause there is a lack of innovation and motivation.\n\u201c\u2026I heard anecdotal stories of where perhaps clients\u2019 expectations of the\nconsultants were not being made because the consultants are getting too\ncosy, the relationship is becoming too cosy, therefore the consultants are\nnot challenged\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee H\n\uf0b7 Esoteric Language\nBloch (1999) argued that consultant\u2019s esoteric language confuses clients and increases\nthe uncertainty in their environment. Interviewee \u201cC\u201d confessed that when he was\nyounger on one occasion, he and his managing director went to talk to people in steel\nfactories. After talking to them for a few minutes, the clients stopped them and told\nthem frankly that they did not understand a word of what they were saying.\nInterviewee \u201cC\u201d recognises that it is a difficult exercise to get rid of a particular piece\nof jargon since he is constantly surrounded with people who speak the same language\nas him. Interviewee \u201cC\u201d argues that it is easy for consultants to forget that clients are\nnot necessarily familiar with different concepts.\n\u201c\u2026we organised a conference with xxxx and we invited clients. So the\nmanaging director and I started talking to clients, for us it sounded so\nsimple, but clients did not understand a thing\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee C\nWhen discussing this matter with interviewee \u201cE\u201d, it was interesting to discover that\nthe esoteric language is also something that consultants suffer from, even amongst\nthemselves. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d recalls internal meetings with senior consultants where\nphrases were virtually made up on the spot.\n96\n\u201c\u2026the more senior business consultants I can recall virtually make up\nphrases on the spot. They do it in internal meetings as well and we know\nthey are talking rubbish\u2026\u201c\nInterviewee E\n\uf0b7 Established Methodologies\nBusiness consultants accept that some criticisms are justified i.e. esoteric language, a\ncertain form of arrogance. On the other hand, there are a couple of instances, when\ntalking to business consultants about a certain lack of innovation in the solutions\nproposed, some of them made an important point: not every client is willing to take\nrisks and develop brand new solutions. Interviewee \u201cJ\u201d suggests that having a set of\ntools or an established methodology can be useful because not all clients want to be\n\u201cguinea-pigs\u201d and test new solutions. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d agrees with interviewee \u201cJ\u201d and\nargues that using a certain methodology has two main advantages; it saves times and\nreduces risks for both clients and consultants.\n\u201c\u2026the benefit of having that sort of methodology is that it is well proven,\ntested and it definitely save time and costs. We guaranty delivering the\nprojects. The methodology will definitely deliver the project on time\nwithin the costs...\u201d\nInterviewee L\nInterviewee \u201cK\u201d also made a point worth mentioning. Business consultancy was\nmainly criticised for the fact that most of the consultancies offer the same advice, and\njust \u201cre-package\u201d them according to clients\u2019 needs. Interviewee \u201cK\u201d argues that it is\nnot because everybody provides the same solutions that there are not good and\nunreliable.\n\u201c\u2026you are bringing somebody who is an expert in business to give you\nsome consultancy; just because they are giving you the answer that\neverybody else gives you does mean that it is the wrong one\u2026\u201d\nInterviewee K\nFrom the different interviews of business consultants, it can be concluded that\nbusiness consultants enjoy several aspects of their role. The variety in the type of\nprojects and the intellectual challenge are two factors that came up on a regular basis.\nOn the other hand, it is interesting to note that answers fluctuates depending on the\nlevel at which consultants intervene in organisations. For instance, long hours and\nheavy workload is an aspect of the role of business consultants that is not really\n97\nenjoyed by senior consultants or partners, whereas more specialised consultants\nsolving mainly technical problems seem to be more annoyed by things like\nbureaucracy or people not committed to their function.\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nThroughout this research results section it was demonstrated that the business\nconsultant\u2019s perception of their own role is far from the pejorative description from\nprevious research. Business consultants appear very much focused on helping clients\nand moving them forward rather than taking advantage of a dominant position and\nincreasing uncertainty in managers\u2019 environments. The perception of business\nconsultants\u2019 relationship with their clients appears surprising. It was demonstrated\nthat business consultants stress the importance of always putting themselves on the\nsame level as managers and see this relationship in terms of a partnership where the\nmajor aim is to transfer essential skills to clients. In this respect, business consultants\nhave shown an amazing degree of humility.\nThe second issue concerns project control. Business consultants appear very\nconscious of the amount of control that they have over the consulting process. It was\nargued that this level of control must be put in perspective with two factors: the level\nof trust between consultants and clients and the level of expertise or experience of the\nclient in a particular field. The research results also suggest that there is a link\nbetween the level of control given to consultants and the perception of the role of the\nconsultant. It was argued at some point that the level of control given to business\nconsultants fluctuates whether clients think they need a \u201cconsultant\u2013expert\u201d or a\nsimple \u201cconsultant-contractor\u201d to solve the problems that the organisation is facing.\nDiscretion or the freedom to change the approach to the consulting process is a\nparticular aspect of the role that is much needed by business consultants. As argued,\nbusiness consultants believe that they are exercising a certain amount of discretion\nwhen working with clients. The research results shown that this discretion fluctuates\nin accordance with the level at which business consultants intervene within\norganisations. The further up the organisation consultants operate, the more likely\nthey are to exercise their discretion.\n98\nWhen asked to comment on delicate issues such as the criticisms overwhelming their\nrole, business consultants appeared very much aware of the different criticisms and\nagree on saying that to a certain extent they are justified. As suggested by interviewee\n\u201cD\u201d, business consultancy is no exception to the rule and as in any industry there are\npeople who do their job professionally, in a very ethical way, but there are also\ncharlatans, people who over-charge and who take advantage of clients. The research\nresults also highlighted the part of responsibility played by clients. Whereas project\nfailures are constantly attributed to business consultants, they strongly disagree and\nprove that on some occasions time and money was wasted because of the client\u2019s lack\nof organisation or inability to express clearly what has to be achieved.\nFinally, most consultants interviewed appear dubious about the reasons underpinning\nthe choice of hiring a consultant and it was proved that occasionally consultants are\nused as tools to do clients\u2019 \u201cdirty work\u201d.\nTable 6. below illustrates the research results. The four themes and sub-themes that\nemerged from the data analysis are presented.\n99\nTable 6. Research Result Summary\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nThemes Sub-Themes Summary\n- Contribution\n- ControlRole\nof business\nconsultants\n- Discretion\nBusiness consultants argued that their ultimate\nrole is to help the client moving forward and add\nvalue. They believe that they are exercising to a\ngreat extent their control.

On the\nother hand, they tend to dislike things such as the\nheavy workload, bureaucracy and a certain\nuncertainty.\n100\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nWith regards to the role of business consultants, it was argued on several occasions\nthat metaphors and other anaphors are often used to define the role of business\nconsultants. It is interesting to note that when Massey (2003: 307) asked three\nbusiness consultants to compare their role, they compared themselves to a gardener, a\npilot and a guide. In this study, business consultants came up with a more extreme\nview in comparing themselves to trouble-shooters and parasites. This little anecdote\nillustrates the subjectivity of business consultants\u2019 perception of their own role.\nRegarding the number of roles played by business consultants, Lippitt and Lippitt\n(1986: 57) argued that business consultants play a number of roles that they judge\nnecessary to reach an expected outcome. The research results confirmed this\nassumption. When discussing this matter with interviewee \u201cA\u201d, he stressed the\nimportance of adapting himself to the client\u2019s situation and therefore playing a\nnumber of different roles depending on the client\u2019s situation. As suggested by\ninterviewee \u201cI\u201d, the role of the business consultant is eclectic and one could argue that\nbusiness consultants play several roles but share one common goal: helping the client\nmoving forward. Business consultants are described in the literature review in a rather\npejorative way, authors such as Bloch (1999) or Shapiro et al (1993) argue that\nbusiness consultants abuse their dominant position and take advantage of their clients\nbut the research results draw a completely different picture. Thus, business\nconsultants see helping clients and moving them forward as the ultimate goal. They\nalso show a real degree of humility in their relationship with clients. As suggested by\nSchein (1997), business consultants must be humble and accept the fact that\nsometimes they cannot help clients because they do not know the answer to a\nparticular organisational issue. Interviewee \u201cE\u201d appeared extremely humble in\nconfessing that sometimes he does not have a solution to his clients\u2019 problems, \u2018that is\nanother thing about some consultants is how about they need to have an answer,\nsometimes there are no answers, sometimes there is no way of solving customers\u2019\nproblems\u2019 (interviewee \u201cE\u201d).\nWith regard to the level of control and discretion, it was demonstrated that the\nmajority of business consultants who have taken part in this research are very much\n101\naware of their level of control. Rotter (1966) developed a framework aiming to\ndistinguish people regarding their perceived locus of control. In this research, apart\nfrom a couple of interviewees, business consultants appear to have a internal locus of\ncontrol meaning that they believe they have a total control over their direct\nenvironment. It is interesting to note that although most of the business consultants\ninterviewed possess an internal locus of control they suggested that clients also share\na part of responsibility in the success of the collaboration between clients and\nconsultants.\nConcerning the level of discretion, it was argued by Carpenter and Golden (1997:\n191) that people having an external locus of control are more likely to perceive\nrelatively little discretion. In the case of interviewee \u201cI\u201d, he believes that he has no\ncontrol at all, but on the other hand feels that he needs a limitless amount of discretion\nfor his intervention to be efficient. In that respect, the role perception of interviewee\n\u201cI\u201d contradicts Carpenter and Golden\u2019s views.\nConcerning the nature of the client \u2013 consultant relationship, Werr et al (1997: 298)\nhad found evidence that consultants see their role more as coaches than experts. The\nresearch results have confirmed this view, most consultants interviewed would\nperceive themselves as support or partners rather than experts: \u2018I would see myself as\nsupport\u2019 (interviewee \u201cI\u201d). They also all stressed the importance of keeping the\nrelationship with their clients on the same equal footing. A study by Covin and Fisher\n(1991) revealed that interpersonal fit between consultants and clients is the key of a\nsuccessful collaboration. It was shown that all the consultants agreed in saying that\ntrust must be at the centre of the relationship. Interviewee \u201cM\u201d for instance argues\nthat \u2018the relationship required for success is that of trusted advisor\u2019. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d\ngoes as far as suggesting that the relationship between clients and consultants must be\nso close that someone external would not be able to differentiate the consultant from\nthe client. Once again, from the research it appears that business consultants do not try\nto put themselves in a superior position and stressed the importance of creating a two-\nway relationship were both parties gain from the collaboration.\nStumpf and Longman (2000) observed that the lack of team work and institutional\nrelationship is what leads projects to failure. This research demonstrated that creating\n102\na climate enabling both clients and consultants to express themselves and stating their\nopinions freely is the key element to the success of a collaboration. Stumpf and\nLongman (2000: 129) argued that clients\u2019 willingness to share information with\nexternal consultants depends a great deal on the consultant\u2019s ability to build trust.\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d confirmed this hypothesis. She suggested that trust is crucial in her\nrole since she deals with people who have a particular knowledge in organisations, to\nbe able to extract that knowledge she must first establish a climate of trust.\nArnaud (1998) argued that there is a psychological aspect in the client-consultant\nrelationship that consultants must not neglect. Interviewees \u201cH\u201d and \u201cD\u201d confirmed\nthis and declared that sometimes in order to get a particular answer to a question, they\nmust listen to half-hour complaints about the organisation and steer the discussion\ntowards issues that are relevant to their intervention; \u2018often to get an answer to a\nparticular question, we need to sit back and listen to half an hour complaining about\nthings within the organisation and you need to steer them in the right direction\u2019\n(interviewee \u201cD\u201d)\nLundberg and Young (2001) on the other hand have argued that consultants, when\ncalled in to provide their clients with expertise, or in reality implicitly called in to\nprovide emotional support. The research results and particularly interviewee \u201cH\u201d \u2019s\nexperience revealed that the role of a business consultant is about giving clients a\ncertain confidence and support with the decisions they make, \u2018So it is about giving the\nclient a certain confidence. \u201cActually yeah, that exactly what you have to do\u201d\u2019\n(interviewee \u201cH\u201d).\nTo conclude on the client-consultant relationship, it was demonstrated in the research\nresults that there is a connection between the client-consultant relationship and\norganisational culture. Schaffer (1997) shares the same view and confirmed what was\nsuggested by interviewee \u201cL\u201d, if business consultants ignore or neglect organisational\nculture, projects will automatically fail.\nRegarding the skills to be an efficient business consultant, Beeby et al (1998: 61)\nsuggested that objectivity is the norm in consulting. This was confirmed by\ninterviewees \u201cE\u201d and \u201cO\u201d who argue that the business must always remain objective\n103\nin their recommendations. It was argued in the research results that business\nconsultants must be able to set aside their company\u2019s as well as their clients\u2019\ncompanies aims and make recommendations in the best interests of clients. Stumpf\nand Longman (2000: 125) argued that the credibility of the client can be gained via a\nparticularly good understanding of the client\u2019s industry or company. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d\nand \u201cO\u201d agree with this assumptions; \u2018I think industry knowledge and function\nknowledge is very valuable to be credible\u2019 (interviewee \u201cO\u201d).\nSteele (1975: 190) claims that \u2018learning is the essence of the consulting process\u2019. The\nresearch demonstrated that business consultants are very much aware of this\nresponsibility and stress the importance of transferring some of their skills to clients.\nInterviewee \u201cD\u201d agrees with Steele (1975) and claims that \u2018transferring skills is the\nmajor aim in consulting\u2019. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d also feels that transferring skills gives more\nvalue to clients and helps developing trust. This approach confirmed Turner\u2019s\nassumption (1988: 12); there has been a change of the role of business consultants\nover the years; \u2018the emphasis of consulting has changed from \u201csolving problems\u201d to\nbuilding clients\u2019 capacity for diagnosing situations\u2019.\nThe research results also put forward the necessity of managing clients\u2019 expectations.\nOjasalo (2001) argued that sometimes in customer service, clients have unrealistic\nexpectations. Interviewee \u201cD\u201d confirms this in declaring that often clients do not have\na clear idea of what they want; \u2018Often they do not even have a clear idea of what it is\nthey are asking you to implement for them, why they need it or what are the benefits\u2019\n(interviewee \u201cD\u201d).\nSolomon et al (1985) suggested that individuals are identified by the role they play, in\nthat case, clients who perceive business consultants as individuals who solve\norganisational issues, might have a false or unrealistic expectation of the role of\nconsultants. This was confirmed by interviewee \u201cK\u201d who suggested that sometimes\nclients idealised the role and the competence of the consultants and are therefore\ndisappointed when they realise that business consultants are here to help clients to\nidentify and solve their problems, not being responsible for solving them. As argued\nby interviewees \u201cK\u201d and \u201cA\u201d, sometimes clients expect consultants to solve issues\nsimply by waving a magic wand.\n104\nAs discussed in the literature review consultants\u2019 poor management of client\nexpectations might well be the source of the criticisms. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d confirmed\nthis and stressed the importance of constantly re-assessing client expectations. Werr\net al (1997) had already argued that consultants and clients must expect to have\ndifferent schemas at the beginning of a project. Interviewee \u201cI\u201d agrees with this\ndifference of expectations and does not see that as a problem but as a first step to help.\nIn that respect, interviewee \u201cI\u201d tends to differentiate himself from other interviewees.\nArnaud (1998: 469) suggested that business consultants are confronted with a\nperverse alternative when balancing their organisations\u2019 and clients\u2019 needs. It\nappeared from the research results that as suggested by Shenson (1990: 19) business\nconsultants are very ethical in their behaviour and always put clients on top; \u2018the\nclients\u2019 needs would almost always come on top\u2019 (interviewee \u201cD\u201d)\nCollin (2000: 9) argued that consultants do not sell anything but \u201cold wine in new\nbottles\u201d. This idea of constantly innovating is also shared by Fullerton and West\n(1996: 45) who suggest that consultants and clients must find a tailor-made solution to\nclients\u2019 organisational issues. Although consultants agree with the idea of tailoring\nsolutions to clients\u2019 specific needs, the fact of having an established methodology\nhelps both clients and consultants to deliver the project on time and most importantly\nwithin a specific budget. As pointed out by interviewee \u201cJ\u201d, not every client is\nprepared to take risks, some of them much prefer it when consultants deliver a\nsolution that was previously tested; \u2018some clients do not want to be the \u201cguinea-pigs\u201d\nand feel more comfortable using a methodology that has already been used with other\ncompanies\u2019 (interviewee \u201cJ\u201d).\nIt seems that business consultants and clients have a common point: they can both\nface uncertainty in their environment. O\u2019Shea and Madigan (1997) as well as Shapiro\net al (1993) argued that consultants exploit manager\u2019s uncertainties in order to sell\neven more of their services and make themselves indispensable, but business\nconsultants also believe that they evolving within an uncertain environment. The\nfeeling of uncertainty is much more a characteristic of the size of the organisation\nrather than a characteristic of a particular role. Business consultants who work for\n105\nlarge consulting organisations also feel as though they are evolving in an insecure\nenvironment.\nAbrahamson (1991) and Blunsdon (2002) made a severe complaint about the use of\nestablished methodologies and the consistency in the solutions offered. Interviewee\n\u201cK\u201d tends to disagree with this criticism and suggests that the fact that business\nconsultants deliver the same solutions to everybody does not necessarily prove that\nthose solutions are the wrong ones. Another major criticism concerned the use of\nesoteric language; the consultobabble (Bloch, 1999). Crucini and Kipping (2001)\nstress the importance of making sure that consultants and clients are on the same\nwavelength when discussing issues together. Business consultants recognise that there\nis a necessity to bear in mind that clients are not experts and therefore not necessarily\naware of different concepts. Interviewee \u201cC\u201d confessed that it can be quite difficult\nfor business consultants to change the way that they express themselves. It was rather\ninteresting and unexpected to note that business consultants can also suffer from\nesoteric language, even amongst themselves. Bloch (1999) drew a line upon the light\nand gullible pep talk of business consultants; he suggests that although consultants\ngive poor advice; they look convincing when they do so. That particular aspect that is\nmuch criticised by Bloch (1999) is actually the \u201cnatural consulting skill\u201d mentioned\nby interviewee \u201cL\u201d in the research results section. Bloch (1999) also criticised the\nlack of experience of junior consultants. The research proved that business consultants\ntend to agree with Bloch (1999) on the fact that experience is what gives credibility to\nclients, and one can question how to advise people on what to do if one has never\ndone it before; \u2018there are lots of consultants out there that have not actually carried out\nbusiness role and who get directly in business consultancy and it makes me wonder\nhow they carry out their jobs, how can you advise somebody on how to run a business\nif you never worked in one\u2019 (interviewee \u201cD\u201d). Kaarst-Brown (1999) argued that on\nsome occasions business consultants can be the victims of clients who use them as\nscapegoats. Interviewees \u201cI\u201d, \u201cA\u201d and \u201cL\u201d confirmed that hidden political agendas\nmentioned by Kaarst-Brown (1999) are part of the consulting process.\nFinally regarding the fees charged to clients, interviewee \u201cI\u201d confirmed what was\nsuggested by Arnaud (1998: 478), clients are sceptical at all times. If the fee is too\nhigh, clients might think that the consultant is interested only in money, on the other\n106\nhand if the fee charged is too low, clients might not listen. Shapiro et al (1993)\nsuggested that once called in business consultants always try to extend the length of\nthe contract, but as pointed out by some consultants, there is a tendency nowadays in\nconsulting to sign on to \u201cfixed priced\u201d contracts. The consulting process become\ntherefore a gamble, where most of the risks are taken by consultants.\nROLE DETERMINANTS MODEL\nThe role determinants model presented in figure 4. illustrates the research findings of\nthis study. As previously demonstrated four major themes have emerged from the data\nanalysis:\nThis model represents a combination of different factors inextricably linked to each\nother; at the centre the role of business consultants. Three major elements constitute\nbusiness consultants\u2019 perception of their role; contribution, discretion and control.\nThese three core elements are themselves directly influenced by external factors such\nas client\u2013consultant relationship, the pros and cons of the role and consultant skills.\nThe particularity of the role determinants model presented in figure 4. is that the all\nthe factors are linked together and in fact, a change in any factor would have\nrepercussions on business consultants\u2019 perception of their role. The model will be\nnow decomposed and each of the three elements of the role of business consultants\nwill be addressed separately.\n107\nFigure 4.Role Determinants Model\nSource: Compiled by the authors\nFigure 5. Skills \/ Pros & Cons \/ Contribution Model\nSource: Compiled by the authors\n108\nFigure 5. shows that business consultants\u2019 contribution is directly influenced by the\npros & cons of their role and the skills they possess. As previously demonstrated there\nare a number of skills (i.e. objectivity, communication skills etc.) that business\nconsultants judge as fundamental for their contribution to have a positive impact on\nthe client\u2019s organisation. Consultant skills and the quality of the contribution are\ntherefore inextricably linked. On the other hand, business consultants\u2019 contribution is\nalso affected by the pros and cons of their role; it was suggested that one of the major\nadvantages of working as a business consultant is the possibility of gaining valuable\nknowledge from working closely with clients. An increase in consultants\u2019 knowledge\nor experience can potentially lead to an improvement of the contribution. The same\nprinciple applies to the cons of the role, a high level of bureaucracy prevents business\nconsultants from doing their job efficiently and in fact limits their contribution.\nFigure 6. illustrates the link between the client\u2013consultant relationship and the level of\ndiscretion of consultants. It was argued by interviewee \u201cL\u201d that the more the client\ntrusts the consultant, the more likely the consultant will be left to run the project the\nway he \/ she wants and therefore enables them to exercise a high level of discretion. It\nwas also demonstrated that one of the pros of working as a business consultant is the\nfact that they can work closely with clients. Pros and Cons of the role are in fact also\nlinked with the client-consultant relationship. Business consultants also suggested that\nthe fact of collaborating with a wide range of clients allows them to keep a high level\nof motivation and decreases the risk of getting bored.\nFigure 6. Relationship \/ Pros & Cons \/ Discretion Model\nSource: Compiled by the authors\n109\nFinally, figure 7. illustrates the link existing between control, skills and relationships.\nRegarding discretion, it was suggested by consultants that there is a strong link\nbetween the level of trust and the level of control; \u2018if you have the client\u2019s trust, they\nwill let you being in charge within boundaries\u2019 (interviewee \u201cL\u201d). Interviewee \u201cE\u201d\nalso pointed out the relationship between skills and control. He suggested that the\namount of control given to business consultants fluctuates depending on the client\u2019s\nperception of the type of skills that the business consultant should possess to solve\ntheir problem. It was suggested at some point that the more skilled the consultant is,\nthe more credible he appears to be in the eyes of his clients.\nFigure 7. Relationship \/ Skills \/ Control Model\nSource: Compiled by the authors\n110\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe research results enable us to gain a better understanding of how business\nconsultants perceive their role and contribution. This section contains several\nrecommendations which aim to assist consultants in rethinking their approach to the\nconsulting process.\nInvolvement Within Consulting Associations\nWhen talking to interviewee \u201cB\u201d, she mentioned a very interesting point in suggesting\nthat consultants should always work in teams. Since interviewee \u201cB\u201d has worked as a\ncoach, she has always tried to share her experiences with other colleagues working for\nother organisations via a French association for the practice of coaching. Interviewee\n\u201cB\u201d explained that it is necessary for consultants to challenge themselves, and ensure\nthat they are constantly re-training and broadening their skills set, otherwise they may\nend up narrowing their field of specialisation, giving the \u201cso controversial\u201d\nimpression of always giving the same advice. A way to overcome this over-\nspecialisation may be to get involved in associations where different types of\nconsultants can meet up in order to compare viewpoints and share experiences.\nBeing involved within these specialised associations, not only enables consultants to\nshare their views and benefit from the experiences of other consultants who might\nhave been through similar situations, but also enables them to share their feelings with\npeople who are able to give constructive advice. It was argued in the literature review\nand confirmed by interviewee \u201cH\u201d that on occasion, consultants adopt the role of\ncoach or therapist in providing clients with emotional support, but one must bear in\nmind that consultants, due to their role and responsibility, must have a different\napproach to dealing with emotions. We argue that consultants should consider getting\ninvolved with professional consulting associations mainly for three reasons:\n\uf071 It would broaden their skills set.\n\uf071 It would provide them with emotional support.\n\uf071 It would enable them to share experiences with their peers.\nSelf-awareness of One\u2019s Capabilities\nThe concept of self-awareness was highlighted by interviewee \u201cN\u201d. Interviewee \u201cN\u201d\nsuggested that before being able to understand client issues, the consultant must be\n111\naware of his own abilities and therefore assess his own strengths and weaknesses. As\ndemonstrated in the research results, objectivity is seen by business consultants as one\nof their fundamental skills, and it is argued that business consultants must identify\ntheir own strengths and weaknesses in order to define their scope of intervention. We\nbelieve that if consultants have not been through that stage of in-depth analysis of\ntheir own capabilities, there is a risk that they will be influenced by the culture of the\norganisation they are working for or by the dynamics of their team, and start working\non projects that they should never have been put on in the first place because of their\nlack of experience or simply their lack of skills. Numerous studies have demonstrated\nthe power of group dynamics and we believe that it takes a great deal of control and\nexperience to become a good consultant. One must be aware of one\u2019s own capabilities\nand be objective enough to admit that maybe the client needs someone else\u2019s\nexperience. It is interesting to note that this view is shared by a number of\nexperienced consultants that have taken part in this study. According to interviewee\n\u201cE\u201d for instance, consultants must be able to step back and admit that sometimes they\ndo not have the answer to a particular organisational issue.\nImportance of Managing Client Emotions\nThe vast majority of the consultants interviewed recognised the importance of\nmanaging client emotions. Interviewee \u201cM\u201d, describe his role as that of a trusted\nadvisor. Business consultants should always remember that when they are called in to\nsolve an organisational issue, the management environment is often chaotic and\nuncertain. Business consultants should not neglect this aspect and ensure that when\nleaving the organisations that they have been working for, managers feel relieved\nfrom this uncertainty. As demonstrated in the research results, there is a real need to\nmanage expectations and manage emotions. Business consultants, more particularly\nthe younger or more inexperienced ones, could find themselves in situations where,\nalthough a good piece of consultancy was delivered, because emotions and\nexpectations have not been managed carefully, clients end up disappointed.\nManaging the workload\nInterviewees \u201cL\u201d and \u201cF\u201d when asked about the downsides of the role of consultants,\nsuggested that the role of consultant is a very challenging one where often consultants\nhave to work late and can at times prioritise their career over their personal needs.\n112\nInterviewee \u201cJ\u201d argues that consultants are \u201coften judged by how busy they are\u201d.\nOnce again group dynamics can have a very negative influence on consultants and\none must be aware of one\u2019s own limits in terms of workload. We all have heard\nanecdotal stories about people who sacrificed their personal life in order to have a\nsuccessful career. We argue that the barrier between private life and personal\nachievement can at time be blurred, but it is important that the consultant\u2019s\ncommitment to their clients does not take over their whole life, and that the issue of\n\u201cwork-life balance\u201d is a very real one which needs to be given the necessary level of\nattention in organisations. Interviewee \u201cL\u201d, since being away from home most of the\ntime, admits that his role as a consultant does not enable him to create his own social\nnetwork, \u201cwhen you are away from home a lot, you don\u2019t tend to build a social\nenvironment. Most of my social network is through work, you don\u2019t tend to build a\nsocial network at home, outside your wife\u2019s network. That\u2019s the bit you can suffer\nwhen doing this job and you have to be prepared to do it, it is quite a big thing\u201d\n(interviewee \u201cL\u201d).\nWe recommend that business consultants should find an activity that they enjoy\npractising on a regular basis and attempt to maintain this even when the workload is\nheavy. We believe that meeting people from a different environment can help\nconsultants to improve the balance of their professional and private life.\nSUMMARY\nThe business consultant\u2019s role and contribution has been examined from different\nperspectives and it has been demonstrated in the concluding comments section that\nthere is an important gap between the conclusions drawn from previous research and\nthe conclusions of this research. The model compiled from the data analysis and\npresented in this chapter highlights the link existing between business consultants\u2019\nperception of their role and external factors. It is hoped that business consultants and\nclients alike will find this model useful to reflect upon their own role and their\napproach to the consulting process.\n113\nSIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH\nThroughout this research project, knowledge was gained on a number of different\nlevels. Firstly, it is firmly believed that potential clients of consulting services can\nbenefit from this research since it demystifies the controversial role of business\nconsultants.\nContribution to Knowledge\nThis research gives another perspective and enables us to understand the business\nconsultants approach to their relationship with clients, their views on the different\ncriticisms of their role as well as what is liked and disliked when working as a\nbusiness consultant. Although more and more organisations currently use business\nconsultants, there is still a strong skepticism about their efficiency and more\nimportantly, there is still a lack of clarity in what a business consultant\u2019s role is. As\nhighlighted, clients often do not have a clear idea of what the role of a consultant is.\nThroughout this study, the role theory was used to ascertain how business consultants\nperceive their role within clients\u2019 organisations. The research results contribute to the\ndevelopment of the role theory in putting forward consultants\u2019 perception of their own\nrole.\nContribution to Practice\nThe research also contributes to the development of the practice of business\nconsulting. Potential clients could find in this research not only the resources\nnecessary to develop a sound relationship with their consultants, but it may also\nprovide them with a clearer idea about how to make the most of their collaboration\nwith business consultants. Existing clients, on the other hand, can reflect upon the\nresults of this research and possibly rethink their approach to working with business\nconsultants.\nThe model built from the output of interviews with business consultants presented in\nthe research results enables clients of consulting services to better prepare their\ncollaboration with consultants.\n114\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\nThis research project and most specifically the research findings have opened the door\nto a number of interesting studies that could be undertaken within the field of business\nconsulting. As mentioned by consultants during interviews, there is a real necessity to\nconstantly review client expectations. The importance of effectively managing client\nexpectations in consulting is a particular aspect of the consultant-client relationship\nthat is thought to be worth exploring in more depth. Throughout this research we\nreferred to clients and business consultants\u2019 behaviour. It was demonstrated that both\nclients and consultants can behave in ways that are not ethical. The research findings\nconclude that the success of a collaboration between clients and business consultants\ndepends to a great extent on ethics and professionalism of both parties and one can\nassume that analysing ethical practices in consulting would be a challenging and\ninteresting study.\nThe research result models presented might also provide researchers with an\nopportunity to test and develop these models (i.e. in taking a different approach to the\nconsulting process). Indeed, one of the aspect that has not been touched in this study\nis the contract specification of a consultancy project. As, it was demonstrated, the role\nof business consultants appear blurred and one can argue that since clients do not have\na clear idea of the role of consultants, project could easily be doomed from the start.\nWe believe that a research project demonstrating the importance of contract\nspecification in consulting would benefit to both clients and business consultants.\nFinally, as suggested by Lundberg and Young (2001), little has been done to research\nemotion in consultancy, however when talking to Human Resources or Human\nCapital Investment consultants, they all highlighted the role that emotions play in the\nconsulting process. Analysing the importance that emotions play in the consultant-\nclient relationship and subsequent development of a model would assist consultants,\nmore particularly junior ones, to ensure that this important aspect of the consulting\nprocess is not neglected.\n115\nREFERENCES\nAbrahamson, E.

Interview Protocol\nThank you for agreeing to participate in this research. This interview is carried out in\norder to contribute to the MA research project of Eddy Louchart at the University \/\nCollege Northampton.\nThe aim of this research is to ascertain how business consultants in general perceive\ntheir role and contribution within their clients\u2019 organisations. It has been noted from\nthe literature that most of the research aiming to ascertain the efficiency of business\nconsultants was carried from an external point of view i.e. clients or academics. This\nresearch project aims to provide consultants with the opportunity to comment on their\nrole and contribution.\nThis interview will be semi-structured and you may feel free to give any additional\ndetails or examples to illustrate your answers.\nIn order to facilitate the data analysis, the interview will be recorded on cassette. You\ncan be assured that all interviews will remain confidential. Your name, the name of\nthe organisation you are working for or the name of clients you have been dealing\nwith will not revealed.\nIf however, you do not wish this interview to be recorded, with your permission, notes\nshall be taken.\nBackground details\nBefore proceeding, some background information is required.\n1.

Do you think that your role is clearly perceived by your clients?\n8. Do you think that you are fulfilling your client\u2019s expectations of business\nconsultants?\n9. How do you manage this expectation?\n10. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much control do you think you have when working\non a project with a client?\n11. When working on a project requiring interviewing different people of different\nlevels in the organisation, do you feel that sometimes you have problems\nidentifying who your client actually is?\n12. Would you say that there is a part of discretion in your role?\nIf Yes: To which extent?\n13. How do you balance your clients\u2019 needs and your company\u2019s needs?\n14. Do you think that some of the criticisms of the role and efficiency of business\nconsultants are to a certain extent justified?\n15.
