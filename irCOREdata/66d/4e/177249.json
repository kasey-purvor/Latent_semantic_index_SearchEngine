ID 116931); published November 30, 2009\nTime-resolved pure-rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy using picosecond-duration laser\npulses is investigated for gas thermometry. The use of picosecond laser pulses significantly reduces back-\nground caused by scattering of the probe beam, and delayed probing of the Raman coherence enables elimi-\nnation of interference from nonresonant four-wave mixing processes. Temperatures inferred from rotational\nspectra are sensitive to the probe delay because of the rotational-level dependence of collisional dephasing of\nRaman coherences. The sensitivity decreases, however, with increasing temperature, and accurate tempera-\nture measurements in a flame are demonstrated using a standard frequency-domain analysis of the spectra.\n\u00a9 2009 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 300.6230, 320.5390, 300.6290, 120.1740, 120.6780, 190.4380.Pure-rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spec-\ntroscopy (RCARS) using nanosecond-duration pulsed\nlaser systems has proven a useful tool for the mea-\nsurement of gas-phase temperatures. In RCARS,\nS-branch rotational Raman transitions are excited\nresonantly by the difference frequency of two pump\nlasers. A narrowband probe laser is scattered from\nthe excited Raman coherence, and the signal is emit-\nted as a coherent beam that is Raman shifted to the\nanti-Stokes side of the probe. Similarly, in rotational\ncoherent Stokes Raman spectroscopy (RCSRS), the\npump lasers excite O-branch Raman transitions, and\nthe signal is generated at the Stokes-shifted fre-\nquency. Temperature is encoded in the relative inten-\nsities of the rotational lines in the spectra. In the\ndual-broadband approach [1,2], a single broadband\ndye laser serves as both pump beams. Not only is the\ncomplete RCSRS\/RCARS spectrum generated on a\nsingle shot, but because each rotational Raman co-\nherence is driven by multiple pairs of laser photons\nfrom the same laser, the influence of dye laser mode\nfluctuations are reduced and a better temperature ac-\ncuracy and precision can be achieved [1\u20133]. In prin-\nciple the evaluation of pure-rotational spectra is\nmuch simpler than for vibrational CARS (VCARS)\nbecause of the large separation of pure-rotational\nlines and the negligible effect of coherent line mixing,\nwhich becomes increasingly important for VCARS at\nincreased pressure. Additionally, the interference\nfrom C2 that can hinder VCARS measurements in\nsooting flames [4] can be avoided using RCARS.\nNevertheless, background from scattering and non-\nresonant four-wave mixing can still pose technical\nchallenges for applied RCARS measurements. Be-\ncause the RCARS signal is spectrally close to the\nprobe laser, elastically scattered light often over-\nwhelms the RCARS signal when focused beams of\nhigh-energy Q-switched nanosecond lasers are used\n0146-9592\/09\/233755-3\/$15.00 \u00a9to produce adequate signal. The different approaches\nthat are commonly used to reduce the background,\ne.g., holographic notch filters [5] or polarization\nschemes [6], either reject part of the RCARS spec-\ntrum or significantly reduce the RCARS signal inten-\nsity. In diffusion flames, a strong, varying back-\nground from nonresonant four-wave mixing\ncoherently interferes with RCARS. The nonresonant\ninterference can be suppressed by selecting appropri-\nate polarizations for the incoming beams [7,8], but\npolarization scrambling from scattering and birefrin-\ngence in the sample and optical system can be a prob-\nlem for practical applications. Alternatively the non-\nresonant contribution can be suppressed by using\nultrashort laser pulses and delaying the probe pulse\n[9]. Roy et al. [10] recently used this approach to\neliminate nonresonant interference from broadband\nVCARS for gas-phase temperature measurements.\nThe current work investigates time-resolved\nRCARS for N2 thermometry. The probe and pump\npulses were produced by a regeneratively amplified\nmode-locked Nd:YAG laser and a broadband dye la-\nser [11] centered at 633 nm. The pulse widths were\napproximately 100 ps. The broadband output was\nsplit into two equal pump beams, and the relative de-\nlay between the pump pulses was zeroed using a me-\nchanical delay. A mechanical delay in the probe beam\npath varied the relative delay between the pump\npulses and the 532 nm probe pulse from \u2212280 ps to\n+660 ps. The RCARS probe volume was formed using\na folded BOXCARS geometry with a 750 mm focal\nlength lens. A 1 m spectrometer equipped with a\n1800 line\/mm grating dispersed the RCARS signal,\nand a backilluminated CCD camera recorded the\nspectra with a dispersion of 0.44 cm\u22121\/pixel.\nRCARS spectra from pure N2 at 294 K and 1 barand from N2 at 1100 K on the fuel-rich side of an\n2009 Optical Society of America\n3756 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 34, No. 23 \/ December 1, 2009atmospheric-pressure laminar CH4 diffusion flame\nwere acquired for a range of probe delays. Addition-\nally, nonresonant four-wave mixing signals from pure\nAr at 294 K and 5 bar were recorded. RCARS spectra\nwere normalized by the nonresonant spectrum with\nthe probe delay set to zero to account for the spectral\nprofile of the broadband dye laser. Even moderate\npulse energies of 500 \u0001J for the probe pulse and\n200 \u0001J for each broadband pump pulse produced\nspectrally integrated single-shot signals of 2\u0002106\ncounts from N2 at 294 K and 1 bar and 5\u0002103 counts\nin the flame. Figure 1 presents spectrally integrated\nRCARS signals as a function of delay. Because the\nnonresonant signal is generated only when two pump\nphotons and a probe photon simultaneously drive the\nfour-wave mixing process, the Ar signal represents\nthe temporal convolution of the probe intensity with\nthe square of the pump intensity. The FWHM of the\nnonresonant signal is approximately 125 ps, which is\nconsistent with Gaussian laser pulses with a FWHM\nof 100 ps. On the other hand, RCARS signals can be\ngenerated when the probe pulse does not temporally\noverlap the pump pulses. For delays greater than\n200 ps, the RCARS signals decay exponentially with\ntime constants of approximately 60 ps for N2 at\n294 K and 1 bar and 170 ps for N2 in the flame. The\nslower decay observed in the flame results from\nsmaller collisional dephasing rates in the flame.\nIt is possible to use a probe delay that reduces the\nnonresonant interference to a negligible level while\ncausing only a relatively small RCARS signal loss.\nFor example, a probe delay of 200 ps reduces the non-\nresonant Ar signal by 3 orders of magnitude from its\npeak value, but it reduces the RCARS signal from\npure N2 at 294 K and 1 bar only by a factor of 10. The\nRCARS signal loss is even less significant at higher\ntemperatures. Figure 2 displays spectra acquired in a\nmixture of 5% N2 in Ar at 294 K and 1 bar. At zero\ndelay [Fig. 2(a)], interference between the nonreso-\nnant and RCARS contributions causes the pro-\nnounced asymmetry in line shapes. Figure 2(b) shows\nthat a 200 ps delay effectively eliminates the inter-\nference.\nThe use of picosecond lasers can also reduce the\nrelative background caused by elastically scattered\nprobe photons. Because elastic scattering typically\noverwhelms the RCARS signal for measurements us-\nFig. 1. (Color online) Spectrally integrated RCARS signal\nplotted as a function of the pump\u2013probe delay.ing nanosecond-duration laser pulses, a double-\nspectrometer or a Raman filter is often used to sup-\npress the background. The use of a filter typically\nrejects data for Raman shifts of less than\n50\u2013100 cm\u22121. In the current work, a filter was not\nnecessary, enabling detection of the complete RCARS\nand RCSRS spectra. In Fig. 2(a), elastic scattering is\ncomparable with the RCARS signal for a N2 partial\npressure of only 0.05 bar; the scattering was negli-\ngible compared with the signal in room air. Increased\nsignal-to-background ratios are possible, because the\nRCARS signal power varies quadratically with the\npump intensity and linearly with the probe intensity,\nwhile the background from elastic scattering varies\nlinearly with the probe pulse energy. For example,\ntime-integrated RCARS signals using lasers with a\npulse duration of 10 ns and a pulse energy of 10 mJ\nshould be similar to those using lasers with a 100 ps\nduration and an energy of 0.5 mJ, but background\nfrom elastic scattering will be 20 times larger for the\nnanosecond-laser-based measurements.\nIt is important to consider the accuracy of tempera-\nture measurements based on delayed spectra. A\nstraightforward analysis employs a frequency-\ndomain contour-fitting procedure that has been used\nextensively for nanosecond-laser-based RCARS [12]\nbut does not explicitly account for J-dependent\ndephasing of coherences that is caused by collisions\noccurring in the time interval between the pump and\nprobe pulses. Figure 3(a) displays the room-\ntemperature N2 RCARS spectrum for zero delay, and\nFig. 3(b) shows the spectrum for a 360 ps delay.\nAlso shown are best-fit theoretical spectra. Although\nthe spectrum for zero delay produces an accurate\ntemperature measurement, the delayed spectrum is\nconsiderably hotter. Figure 3(c) demonstrates that\ntemperature evaluation is relatively accurate\n\u0001294\u00b113 K\u0002 for short delays of less than 150 ps, for\nwhich the probe pulse still overlaps the pump pulses.\nAt the longer delays required for significant suppres-\nsion of nonresonant interference, however, the evalu-\nated temperatures increase with increasing delay.\nThis trend is caused by the J dependence of dephas-\ning rates, which decrease significantly with increas-\ning rotation for N2\u2013N2 collisions at 294 K [13]. Be-\ncause collisions dephase low-J Raman coherences\nFig. 2. Spectra (corrected for dark counts) from 5% N2 in\nAr at 294 K and 1 bar for delays of (a) 0 ps and (b) 200 ps.faster than high-J coherences, the RCARS spectrum\nDecember 1, 2009 \/ Vol. 34, No. 23 \/ OPTICS LETTERS 3757becomes hotter with increasing probe delay, and the\nevaluated temperature is too large if this effect is not\nincluded in the calculation of the spectra.\nAt increased temperatures, the dephasing rates\nare not only smaller, but they also are much less de-\npendent on J [13]. For illustration, Fig. 4 presents\nRCARS spectra from the fuel-rich side of the diffu-\nsion flame. For zero delay, nonresonant interference\nis clearly evident, but a probe delay of 260 ps sup-\npresses the interfering background, producing a\nclean N2 spectrum. Similar spectra were obtained for\na range of probe delays greater than 150 ps to ensure\nadequate rejection of the background, and Fig. 4(c)\nplots the best-fit temperatures as a function of the\nprobe delay. In contrast to the 294 K measurements,\nthe evaluated temperatures in the flame show only a\nFig. 3.

To check the consistency of\nthe delayed-probe temperature measurement with a\nstandard RCARS measurement, the background was\ninstead eliminated using a polarization approach\nwith zero probe delay [8]. The evaluated temperature\nwas 1120 K, in excellent agreement with time-\ndelayed-probe measurements.\nIn summary, time-delayed picosecond RCARS is a\nuseful tool for suppression of nonresonant back-\nground. Because collisions that occur in the time in-\nterval between the pump and probe pulses can sig-\nnificantly change the relative shape of the recorded\nRCARS spectrum, a time-dependent model will be\ndeveloped for robust and accurate analysis of time-\ndelayed spectra. The effect of these collisions, how-\never, is mitigated at increased temperatures, and\ntemperature evaluation with accuracy comparable\nwith nanosecond RCARS was demonstrated using an\nestablished frequency-domain analysis at 1100 K in\na flame. The use of short pump pulses was also\nshown to reduce significantly the relative back-\nground caused by elastic scattering of the probe\npulse, enabling collection and analysis of the entire\nRCSRS and RCARS spectra without the use of a Ra-\nman filter or polarizers.\nFunding provided by the U.S. Department of En-\nergy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of\nChemical Sciences and the Bavaria California Tech-\nnology Center.
