INTRODUCTION\nSolitary waves may be found in solutions to nonlinear\nwave equations where the nonlinearity counteracts the dis-\npersion of a wave packet such that it retains its form as it\npropagates. Solitons are solitary waves that emerge un-\nscathed from collisions with each other, up to shifts in posi-\ntion and phase; this behavior is reminiscent of particle be-\nhavior, motivating the particle name soliton. This distinction\nis an important one, although in practice the names soliton\nand solitary wave are commonly interchanged. \u201cClassic\u201d\nsolitons, in this sense, are to be found in integrable nonlinear\nwave equations, such as the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation, the\nsine-Gordon equation, and the one-dimensional nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. The solitons\u2019 ability to reemerge after\ncollisions is due to the fact that their dynamics are strongly\nconstrained by conservation laws associated with the wave-\nequations\u2019 integrability \u00031\u0004.\nSolitons and solitary waves are topics of keen interest in\nthe atomic Bose-Einstein condensate \u0001BEC\u0002 community.\nThis is because low-temperature BEC dynamics are fre-\nquently described to a good approximation by the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation \u0001GPE\u0002 \u00032\u20134\u0004, a three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002\nnonlinear wave equation. For regimes where the atoms are\nconfined in the radial direction by a tight trapping potential,\nthe 3D GPE reduces approximately to a one-dimensional\n\u00011D\u0002 equation \u0001the so-called 1D GPE\u0002. The homogeneous 1D\nGPE is simply the 1D nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which\ncan be solved by the inverse scattering transform, and yields\nbright soliton solutions when the nonlinearity is attractive\n\u00031,5\u0004. At sufficiently low temperatures the interatomic scat-\ntering can be largely described through a single parameter,\nthe s-wave scattering length. In this context, an attractive\nnonlinearity arises from a negative s-wave scattering length,\nwhich may be intrinsic, or which may be induced by exploit-\ning a Feshbach resonance to tune the interatomic interactions\n\u00036,7\u0004. As well as describing BEC under tight transverse con-\nfinement, the 1D nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is also used\nto describe nonlinear optical systems \u00038,9\u0004. These systems\nprovide a useful analog of BEC under tight transverse con-\nfinement, and we will frequently refer to work on nonlinear\noptics in this paper.\nExperiments involving BECs composed of attractively in-\nteracting atoms have been performed in 1D geometries, re-\nsulting in the observation of single \u000310\u0004 and multiple bright\nsolitary waves \u000311\u201313\u0004. In the experiments with multiple\nsolitary waves, the BEC was trapped in the axial direction by\na \u0001relatively weak\u0002 harmonic confining potential in addition\nto the radial confinement. The addition of an axial harmonic\npotential acts to break the integrability of the 1D GPE, mean-\ning that we no longer have exact soliton solutions. In the\nexperiment by Strecker et al. \u000312,13\u0004, classic soliton behav-\nior \u0001where the solitary waves collide and reform up to shifts\nin phase and position\u0002 was not observed, but rather, trains of\nsolitary waves which are continuously repelled by each\nother. The dynamics of solitary-wave trains both in BEC and\nnonlinear optics have been the topic of extensive modeling\nusing a variational method \u000314\u0004, numerical simulations\n\u000315\u201320\u0004, a Toda lattice approach \u000321\u0004, a particle model \u000322\u0004\n\u0001quite distinct to that presented in this paper\u0002, analysis using\nthe inverse-scattering transform \u000323\u0004, and by using a pertur-\nbation approach \u000324\u201326\u0004. These treatments model regimes\nwhere the solitary waves are never well separated, where it\nhas been found that the solitary waves do not collide with\neach other and reform, but interact with each other by attrac-\ntive and repulsive forces, depending on their relative phase.\nMotivated by the observation of such soliton trains, a \u201csoli-\nton laser\u201d has been proposed \u000327\u0004. A review on BEC solitons\naddresses some of this work in more detail \u000328\u0004.\nAs opposed to solitary-wave trains, we investigate\nwhether classic solitonlike behavior, i.e., colliding and re-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 77, 013620 \u00012008\u0002\n1050-2947\/2008\/77\u00011\u0002\/013620\u000115\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society013620-1\nforming of distinct, localized wave packets up to shifts in\nphase and position, is possible in the 1D GPE with a har-\nmonic potential. In a previous work \u000329\u0004 we found regimes\nwhere such behavior is quite pronounced. This behavior was\nalso seen in work done in similar nonlinear optical settings\n\u000330\u201333\u0004. In this paper we further our investigation into soli-\nton behavior; in particular we explore the bounds within\nwhich the solitary waves can still be expected to behave as\nsolitons. To this end, we use a particle model introduced in\nour previous work \u000329\u0004, adapted from a model developed for\nuse in nonlinear optics \u000330\u201332\u0004 by using a potential and units\nappropriate for BEC. We show that soliton behavior is pos-\nsible in the 1D GPE with a harmonic potential, provided that\nthe solitary waves collide with large enough relative velocity\nsuch that the collisions occur during a short time scale com-\npared with the period of the axial trapping potential. This\ntype of behavior has recently been experimentally observed\n\u000311\u0004, and provides an exciting prospect for future experi-\nments to probe the dynamics in more detail.\nIn the case of three solitons, we find regimes of regular\nand chaotic dynamics. In particular, chaotic solutions to the\nGPE are expected to coincide with more rapid condensate\ndepletion than in otherwise similar regular solutions \u000334\u0004;\nindeed this has been seen in theoretical studies of several\nsystems \u000335\u201339\u0004. This provides an additional motivation to\nidentify regimes of regular and chaotic soliton dynamics in\nthe GPE.\nIn more realistic models for BECs, the integrability of the\nnonlinear wave equation is also broken by residual 3D ef-\nfects. These effects cause the soliton collisions to be inelas-\ntic; specifically, there is particle exchange between the soli-\ntons accompanied by changes in their outgoing velocities\n\u000340\u0004. A reduction from 3D to nonintegrable 1D equations\n\u000341,42\u0004, more sophisticated than the 1D GPE, confirms this\nresult \u000343\u0004. This type of behavior is common in other nonin-\ntegrable Schr\u00f6dinger-type equations \u000344\u201347\u0004. Bose-Einstein\ncondensates with attractive interatomic interactions are prone\nto collapse if the particle density becomes too high \u000311\u0004.\nFully 3D GPE simulations show that in-phase collisions be-\ntween solitons, during which the particle density becomes\nlarge, can cause collapse of the condensate \u000311,40,48\u0004. In this\npaper, as well as identifying regimes in which solitonlike\nbehavior can still occur despite the mild breaking of integra-\nbility by the harmonic potential, we also briefly discuss re-\ngimes where solitons are expected to survive 3D integrability\nbreaking.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows: in Sec. II we intro-\nduce the model equations and reiterate the soliton solution to\nthe homogeneous 1D GPE; in Sec. III we identify one, two,\nand three solitary-wave solutions to the 1D GPE with a har-\nmonic potential and introduce a particle model to test their\nsoliton nature; in Sec. IV we present our conclusions.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Model system\nFollowing, for example, the well-known number-\nconserving treatment of a BEC \u000349\u201351\u0004, we are free to par-\ntition the field operator into condensate and noncondensate\nparts,\n\u0002\u02c6 \u0001r\u0002 = a\u02c6\u0002\u0001r\u0002 + \u0003\u0002\u02c6 \u0001r\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere a\u02c6 annihilates a particle in mode \u0002\u0001r\u0002, and \u0003\u0002\u02c6 \u0001r\u0002 is\nthe field operator for modes orthogonal to the condensate. In\nthe case of a trapped, almost fully Bose-condensed dilute\natomic gas, the dynamics of the condensate mode \u0002\u0001r\u0002 are\nlargely governed by the following GPE \u000349,50\u0004:\ni\u0004\n\u0001\n\u0001t\n\u0002\u0001r,t\u0002 = \u0005\u2212 \u00042\u000222m + Vext\u0001r\u0002 + g3DN\u0006\u0002\u0001r,t\u0002\u00062\u0007\u0002\u0001r\u0002 ,\n\u00012\u0002\nwhere N is the total number of particles in the condensate\nand \u0002\u0001r\u0002 is normalized to one.\nWe now consider a cylindrically symmetric \u0001cigar-shaped\u0002\nharmonic trapping potential,\nVext\u0001r\u0002 =\nm\n2\n\u0003\u0005x\n2x2 + \u0005r\n2\u0001y2 + z2\u0002\u0004 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere \u0005x\u0001\u0005r. We also explicitly assume a\u00060 \u0001attractive\ninterparticle interactions\u0002, and determine that Eq. \u00012\u0002 reduces\nto the following 1D equation \u0001see Appendix A for a deriva-\ntion\u0002:\ni\n\u0001\n\u0001t\n\u0007\u0001x\u0002 = \u2212\n1\n2\n\u00012\n\u0001x2\n\u0007\u0001x\u0002 +\n\u00052x2\n2\n\u0007\u0001x\u0002 \u2212 \u0006\u0007\u0001x\u0002\u00062\u0007\u0001x\u0002 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere x is measured in units of \u00042 \/m\u0006g1D\u0006N and t in units of\n\u00043 \/m\u0006g1D\u00062N2, with g1D=2\u0004\u0005ra and \u0005 equal to the axial fre-\nquency \u0005x in our units of inverse time \u0001m\u0006g1D\u00062N2 \/\u00043\u0002.\nIt can be shown that linear instabilities in the GPE directly\nimply, in both Bogoliubov \u000352\u0004 and equivalent number-\nconserving linearized approaches \u000349\u0004, that the population of\nthe noncondensate component may rapidly become signifi-\ncant. For this reason we expect regimes where the GPE dy-\nnamics are chaotic to coincide with rapid depletion of the\ncondensate. The GPE is a norm-conserving equation, so the\ndepletion will not show up in the GPE dynamics; however,\nwe may use chaos in GPE dynamics as an indicator of deple-\ntion of the condensate mode in a realistic system. This mo-\ntivates the identification of chaotic trajectories in the GPE\ndynamics, as we discussed in the introduction \u0001Sec. I\u0002.\nB. Soliton solution to homogeneous GPE\nIn the case of no axial potential \u0003equivalent to setting \u0005\n=0 in Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0004, it is possible to find exact solutions of Eq. \u00014\u0002\n\u00035\u0004. A straightforward interpretation is in terms of a scatter-\ning problem \u00031\u0004; in the limit t\u2192\u2212\b, the solutions take the\nform of an arbitrary number of well-separated \u0001incoming\u0002\nsolitons:\n\t j\u0001x,t\u0002 = 2\n j sech\u00032\n j\u0001x \u2212 qj\u0002\u0004eivj\u0001x\u2212qj\u0002ei\u00012\nj\n2+vj\n2\/2\u0002tei\u000b0j .\n\u00015\u0002\nHere qj =v jt+x0j is the position of the peak of the jth soliton;\nx0j is the peak position at t=0; \u000b0j \u2212v jx0j is the phase for a\nMARTIN, ADAMS, AND GARDINER PHYSICAL REVIEW A 77, 013620 \u00012008\u0002\n013620-2\nsingle soliton \u0001i.e., in the absence of collisions with other\nsolitons\u0002 at x=0, t=0; v j is the soliton velocity and \n j gives\nthe relative size of the soliton.

SOLITON DYNAMICS WITH A HARMONIC\nEXTERNAL POTENTIAL\nA. Single soliton\nAs shown in Appendix B, for any solution to the 1D har-\nmonic GPE, there exist other solutions with the same density\nprofile, undergoing arbitrary amplitude harmonic oscillations\nat the trap frequency. In particular, for any stationary solu-\ntion, there exist corresponding solutions with the same den-\nsity profile, which oscillate with the trap frequency but re-\nmain otherwise unchanged. Hence, a single bright soliton in\na harmonic trap experiences an overall simple harmonic mo-\ntion without any manifestation of internal dynamics in the\nsoliton\u2019s density profile.\nThe density profile and phase behavior of a single soliton\ncan be found by first considering the form of a stationary\nsoliton, and then inferring the behavior of the oscillating ver-\nsion.

Overview\nIn this section, we present a simple model of multiple\ntrapped solitons, treating each of the solitons as a classical\nparticle. We explore the case of two harmonically trapped\nsolitons, and present results comparing the trajectories in the\nparticle model with simulations of the wave dynamics in the\nGPE. These results allow us to determine the range of initial\nconditions for which the particle model is a good description\nof the system.\n2. Particle model\nRecall from Sec. II that, in a homogeneous system, the\ntrajectories of solitons emerging from collisions with each\nother are independent of the relative phase of the incoming\nsolitons. The only effect of the relative phase of the solitons\nis on the form of the wave function \u0001peak or trough\u0002 during\nthe collision. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. The phase indepen-\ndence of the solitons\u2019 incoming and outgoing trajectories al-\nlows a model to be formulated that treats the solitons as\nclassical particles, each with only the positional degree of\nfreedom \u0001rather than position and phase degrees of freedom\nused, for example, in \u000322\u0004\u0002. This model was introduced by\nScharf and Bishop in the context of nonlinear optics \u000330\u201332\u0004,\nwhich we have adapted for the purpose of modeling a\nquasi-1D harmonically trapped BEC \u000329\u0004 by using a poten-\ntial and units appropriate for modeling BEC.\nTo construct the particle model, we first consider the ho-\nmogeneous solution before introducing the effects of the har-\nmonic trap. Following the approach in \u000358\u0004, one can derive\nan effective intersoliton potential \u0001see Appendix D\u0002,\nV\u0001qj \u2212 qk\u0002 = \u2212 2\n j\nk\u0001\n j + \nk\u0002sech2\u0005 2\n j\nk\n j + \nk \u0001qj \u2212 qk\u0002\u0007 ,\n\u000112\u0002\nwhich treats the solitons as particles of position qj and effec-\ntive mass \n j, the parameters used to describe the bright soli-\nton solutions of Eq. \u00015\u0002. This potential reproduces the\nasymptotic position shifts \u0003Eq. \u00016\u0002\u0004 in the homogeneous GPE\nfor the outgoing particle trajectories, i.e., the position shifts\nas the solitons become infinitely far apart. It yields accurate\nresults when 2\u0006\n1\u2212\n2\u0006\u0001 \u0006v1\u2212v2\u0006, where v1 and v2 are the\nsoliton velocities, and which gives a lower limit for the rela-\ntive velocity for which the particle model is applicable.\nFigure 2 shows the particle trajectories predicted by our\nmodel interaction potential \u0003Eq. \u000112\u0002\u0004 superimposed on the\ndensity profile dynamics predicted by solution of the homo-\ngeneous 1D GPE. When modeling BEC dynamics, an upper\nlimit to the solitons\u2019 relative velocity is also imposed, be-\ncause the contact-interaction potential between atoms, used\nto derive the GPE, assumes low-energy interatomic colli-\nsions, and may not be applicable to condensates with high\nrelative approach speeds \u000359\u0004. Fortunately, recent experi-\nments \u000311,13\u0004 show that solitons are generated with similar\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Two-soliton collision taking place when \u0001a\u0002 \u0011\fcol=0, \u0001b\u0002 \u0011\fcol=\u0012 \/2, \u0001c\u0002 \u0011\fcol=\u0012, and \u0001d\u0002 \u0011\fcol=3\u0012 \/2. x is\nmeasured in units of \u00042 \/m\u0006g1D\u0006N and t in units of \u00043 \/m\u0006g1D\u00062N2. The parameters of the system are taken to be similar to those of a recent\nexperiment \u000313\u0004. The axial trapping frequency is 1.59 Hz, the radial trap frequency is 127.32 Hz, atomic mass and scattering length of 7Li,\nand 5000 particles per soliton. The unit of x is then equal to 3.6 \u000fm, and a unit of t is equal to 1.4 ms.\nMARTIN, ADAMS, AND GARDINER PHYSICAL REVIEW A 77, 013620 \u00012008\u0002\n013620-4\nsizes, such that their velocities may easily fall within our\nmodel\u2019s range of validity.\nIn Sec. III A we showed that independent trapped solitons\noscillate harmonically. A more general method for deriving\nthe approximate motion of solitons in an external potential of\narbitrary form was found by Scharf and Bishop \u000332\u0004, and is\noutlined in Appendix C for completeness. To combine the\neffects of the external potential and the soliton collisions, we\nuse the homogeneous solution \u0003Eq. \u00015\u0002\u0004 as an ansatz, so that\nthe solitons are still characterized by the parameters qj and\n\n j. Figure 1 shows this to be a reasonable approximation.\nThe following Hamiltonian:\nH = \b\nj=1\nNs \u0005 pj22\n j + \n j\u0005\n2qj\n2\n2 \u0007 \u000113\u0002\nreproduces the harmonic motion of the solitons, keeping the\ninterpretation of \n j as effective masses \u0001see Appendix C\u0002. We\nassume that the soliton-soliton interactions are not affected\nby the introduction of the \u0001relatively loose\u0002 harmonic trap\nand construct the full Hamiltonian by adding in the contri-\nbutions from the interaction potentials,\nH = \b\nj=1\nNs \u0005 pj22\n j + \n j\u0005\n2qj\n2\n2 \u0007\n\u2212 \b\n1\u0013j\u0006k\u0013Ns\n2\n j\nk\u0001\n j + \nk\u0002sech2\u0005 2\n j\nk\n j + \nk \u0001qj \u2212 qk\u0002\u0007 ,\n\u000114\u0002\nwhere Ns is the number of solitons. This approach is ex-\npected to be valid for regimes when the time scale of the\nsoliton-soliton collisions is much less than the period of the\nharmonic trap, such that the effects of the harmonic trap are\nnegligible during the collisions. The limits of this approach\nare further explored in Sec. III B 3.\nIn the case of two solitons \u0001Ns=2\u0002, it is useful to define\nthe following independent coordinates: the center-of-mass\nposition Q : = \u0001\n1q1+\n2q2\u0002 \/ \u0001\n1+\n2\u0002 and the relative position\nq : =q1\u2212q2.

The Hamiltonian is now clearly separable into two\nparts: the center-of-mass energy E \u0001dependent on P and Q\nonly\u0002, and the interaction energy \u0014 \u0001dependent on p and q\nonly\u0002. There are thus two independent constants of the mo-\ntion, E and \u0014, as many as there are degrees of freedom.\nHence, the particle model for two solitons is integrable and\nthe dynamics must be completely regular \u000360,61\u0004.

These Poincar\u00e9 sections demonstrate the\nregular behavior of the integrable two-particle system, as all\ntrajectories lie on invariant tori in the phase space of the\nsystem. There are two distinct regimes observable in these\nPoincar\u00e9 sections. In the lower regions of the sections, the\ncenter-of-mass energy, E, is large and positive; in this case\nthe interaction energy, \u0014, has a large negative contribution\nfrom the interaction term, and the solitons interact strongly.\nIt is seen in Sec. III B 3 that in this regime, there is rapid\nenergy exchange between the solitons, such that the soliton\nwith lower amplitude oscillations is driven by the other soli-\nton, which itself becomes damped. In the upper regions of\nthe sections, E is less positive, and hence \u0014 is less negative,\nso the energy exchange between the solitons occurs over a\nlonger time period.\n3. Comparison between GPE and particle evolutions\nIn the Poincar\u00e9 sections of Fig. 3, we highlighted a num-\nber of trajectories in white. These trajectories are plotted in\nposition space as a function of time, overlaying density plots\nof corresponding 1D GPE solutions, in Figs. 4\u20137. Two soli-\ntons with equal norms in a harmonic trap have the same\ncollisional form for all subsequent collisions; i.e., two soli-\ntons initially colliding with a phase difference \fcoll, will have\nthis phase difference for all subsequent collisions \u0001see Ap-\npendix E\u0002. This property allows results of GPE simulations\nwith repeated in-phase and \u0012 out-of-phase collisions to be\ncompared for any trajectory in the two-particle model. Re-\ngimes with phase differences between zero and \u0012 are not\nconsidered here, but will generally be expected to display\nbehavior intermediate between that of the zero and \u0012 cases.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the phase difference between the\nsolitons has an observable effect on the solitons\u2019 form during\ncollisions, although as the solitons tend asymptotically apart,\nthe solitons\u2019 density dynamics are insensitive to this. Figure\n8 shows how rapidly the solitons\u2019 trajectories in the wave\nand particle model converge. The convergence is more rapid\nwhen the solitons collide in phase than when they collide \u0012\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Trajectories in the particle model \u0001lines\u0002 plotted over density distributions predicted by 1D GPE dynamics,\ncorresponding to the trajectory marked in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002.

When we formulated the particle model with a\nharmonic trap, we assumed the collision time to be much\nshorter than the period of the harmonic trap. We attribute the\ndiscrepancy between the particle and GPE dynamics in Figs.\n4\u20137 to the nonzero collision time.\nAs expected, the agreement is generally better for in-\nphase collisions than for \u0012 out-of-phase collisions. In a har-\nmonic trap, subsequent to a collision, two solitons can only\nmove a finite distance apart \u0001i.e., not asymptotically far\u0002 be-\nfore moving together and colliding once more. Because re-\npeated collisions preserve the collisional phase difference,\nthe resulting discrepancy between the particle and GPE dy-\nnamics rapidly builds up. However, when the solitons collide\nwith sufficient velocity \u0001Fig. 7\u0002, the collision time is short\nenough compared to the trap period for both zero and \u0012\ncases to give good agreement between the particle model and\nthe GPE dynamics.\nC.

It turns out to be convenient to con-\nsider slightly different coordinates, however, as this produces\na simpler final form for the Hamiltonian describing the\nstretch mode dynamics. We therefore define QT=\nZT=\n\u0001q1\n+q2+q3\u0002 \/3, qc=\nzc=\n\u0001q1\u2212q3\u0002 \/2, and qr=\nzr=\n\u0001q1+q3\n\u22122q2\u0002. We rescale the time to t\u02dc=\n2t, and then introduce the\nmomenta pc=wc \/\n2= \u0001p1\u2212 p3\u0002 \/\n2 and pr=wr \/\n2= \u0001p1\u22122p2\n+ p3\u0002 \/6\n2. Using these dynamical variables, the resultant\nHamiltonian \u0001the reduced system Hamiltonian\u0002, with the\ncenter-of-mass degrees of freedom removed, becomes\nH\u02dc = 3pr\n2 +\n\u00052\n2\n4\nqr\n2\n12\n+\npc\n2\n4\n+\n\u00052\n2\n4\nqc\n2\n\u2212 4 sech2\u00012qc\u0002\n\u2212 4 sech2\u0005qc + qr2 \u0007 \u2212 4 sech2\u0005qc \u2212 qr2 \u0007 . \u000121\u0002\nThis Hamiltonian, describing the two remaining degrees of\nfreedom, is not separable, and it is necessary to integrate the\ncorresponding Hamilton\u2019s equations of motion numerically\nto analyze the system\u2019s behavior. As they represent a slice\nthrough the phase space of a system, Poincar\u00e9 sections pro-\nvide a good illustration of regions of regular and chaotic\ndynamics. In regions of regular behavior, any trajectory will\nlie on a torus in phase space, and will thus trace a closed\ncurve in the Poincar\u00e9 section; in regions of chaotic behavior,\na trajectory will go through every point in that region of\nphase space, and thus fill an area on the Poincar\u00e9 section \u0001a\nso-called ergodic sea\u0002 \u000360,61\u0004. We choose to show sections\ncorresponding to the momentum pr and position qr of the\n\u201casymmetric stretch\u201d mode when the \u201cstretch\u201d mode coordi-\nnate takes the value qc=0, and when its canonically conju-\ngate momentum pc\u00060. Other sections can be expected to be\nequally illustrative of the qualitative behavior.\nFigure 9 shows six Poincar\u00e9 sections for three different\nreduced system energies H\u02dc . The behavior is regular at large\npositive values of H\u02dc \u0003Fig. 9\u0001a\u0002\u0004, but as H\u02dc is reduced, chaotic\nbehavior emerges, characterized by ergodic regions in be-\ntween regular tori. For small \u0001negative\u0002 H\u02dc the system is\nmostly an ergodic sea, with islands of stability \u0003Fig. 9\u0001c\u0002\u0004;\nbut as H\u02dc is made more negative, the chaotic regions begin to\nsubside, and the behavior becomes increasingly regular\nagain.\nConsideration of the form of the reduced-system Hamil-\ntonian \u0003Eq. \u000121\u0002\u0004 shows that without the interaction the sys-\ntem is integrable, as it becomes a decoupled pair of harmonic\noscillators. When H\u02dc is large and positive, the interaction part\nof the Hamiltonian \u0001which is always negative\u0002 should give a\nrelatively small contribution to the Hamiltonian, compared to\nthe integrable part of the Hamiltonian \u0001which is always posi-\ntive\u0002. When H\u02dc is reduced, this is no longer the case, and\nchaotic dynamics are manifest. However, in regimes where\nthe coordinates and momenta are close to zero, i.e., H\u02dc ap-\nproaches its lower bound of \u221212, the interaction potential\nbecomes approximately harmonic. The Hamiltonian H\u02dc takes\nthe following separable form:\nH\u02dc = 3pr\n2 + \u0005 \u0005224\n4 + 2\u0007qr2 + pc\n2\n4\n+ \u0005 \u000522\n4 + 24\u0007qc2, \u000122\u0002\ni.e., it again describes a pair of decoupled harmonic oscilla-\ntors. We consequently expect the phase-space structure to be\nqualitatively similar in the opposing limits of H\u02dc very large\nand positive, and H\u02dc large and negative. From Figs. 9\u0001a\u0002 and\n9\u0001f\u0002, we do indeed observe this to be the case.\n2. Comparison with GPE simulations\nFigure 10 shows a comparison of trajectories in the par-\nticle model with results from integrations of the 1D GPE\n\u0003Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0004 for the three-soliton system, where the solitons all\nhave equal effective masses. As with the two-soliton case\n\u0001Sec. III B\u0002, the trajectories in the particle model gradually\nacquire a shift with respect to the trajectories traced out by\nthe GPE wave-function peaks. In Figs. 10\u0001a\u0002 and 10\u0001b\u0002 the\noverall shift indicates that subsequent collisions tend to take\nplace sooner in the particle model than is predicted by the\nGPE evolution; interestingly, in Fig. 10\u0001c\u0002 we observe the\nopposite, however. As before, these shifts are caused by an\naccumulation of small errors, due to the fact that within a\nharmonic confining potential the individual solitons do not\nBRIGHT SOLITARY-MATTER-WAVE COLLISIONS IN A \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW A 77, 013620 \u00012008\u0002\n013620-9\nmove asymptotically far from each other subsequent to col-\nlisions. In Fig. 10\u0001c\u0002 there is the added complication that two\nof the solitons appear to have formed a \u201cbound state.\u201d\nThe comparisons illustrate the good agreement between\nthe particle model and the 1D GPE in the regimes in which\nthe particle model is valid, i.e., when solitons are well sepa-\nrated between collisions \u0003Figs. 10\u0001a\u0002 and 10\u0001b\u0002\u0004, even when\nthe motion is chaotic \u0003Fig. 10\u0001b\u0002\u0004. When two of the solitons\nare not well separated \u0003Fig. 10\u0001c\u0002\u0004, the 1D GPE simulation\nshows that a \u201cbound state\u201d is formed, which looks like a\nsingle \u201chigher-order\u201d soliton with an excited breathing mode\n\u000323\u0004. The particle model does not predict well the behavior\nwithin the \u201cbound state,\u201d but does give a good prediction of\nthe center-of-mass motion of the \u201cbound state\u201d and its inter-\nactions with the other soliton; it is likely that the behavior of\nthe density of the \u201cbound state\u201d is strongly coupled to the\nphase behavior within the \u201cbound state.\u201d As in the two-\nsoliton case \u0001Sec. III B\u0002, errors gradually accumulate in the\nparticle model which lead to an overall \u201ctime shift\u201d in the\noverall collision dynamics. It should be noted, however, that\napart from this shift qualitative agreement with the dynamics\npredicted by the GPE remains quite good right up until limits\nof our numerical calculations \u0001t=10 000 corresponding to 6 s\nfor the experimental parameters in \u000313\u0004\u0002.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have investigated the soliton nature of\ntwo and three bright solitary waves in harmonically trapped\n1D Bose-Einstein condensates. To this end we employed a\nmodel treating each soliton as a classical particle and com-\npared the particle trajectories with simulations of the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation. The results from the particle model and\nthe GPE display good agreement when the solitons collide\nwith large relative velocities, such that the collision time is\nsmall with respect to the trap period. When the solitons\u2019\nrelative velocities are reduced, the trajectories in the particle\nmodel \u201cget ahead\u201d of those in the GPE simulations, i.e.,\npoints on the particle trajectories can be identified with cor-\nresponding points in time during the GPE evolutions, but the\nGPE evolution is increasingly delayed by comparison; this\neffect is more pronounced when the solitons collide out of\nphase, and is due to the nonzero time in which the particle\ntrajectories asymptote to the wave trajectories after colli-\nsions.\nWe have shown that, when the external potential is har-\nmonic, for systems of two solitons of equal size, the phase\ndifference between the solitons is preserved for repeated col-\nlisions. In these systems, repeated out-of-phase collisions can\ncause the discrepancy between the dynamics in the particle\nmodel and the GPE to build up relatively rapidly. We note\nthat it is in this regime, i.e., solitons colliding \u0012 out of phase,\nthat the solitons are predicted to be stable against collapse\nwhen 3D effects are considered.\nFinally, we have extended the treatment to systems of\nthree harmonically trapped solitons. Using the particle model\nwe have shown that, unlike the two-soliton systems, systems\nof three solitons can display chaotic dynamics. Chaotic re-\ngimes rescind when the energy of the particle system \u0001with\nthe center-of-mass motion neglected\u0002 is very positive or very\nnegative. In these limits, the dynamics decouple to those of\ntwo separated simple harmonic oscillators. The agreement\nbetween the dynamics in the particle model and the GPE\nsimulations is good in both regular and chaotic regimes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank J. Brand, S. L. Cornish, K.-P.

This method has the advantage that it can\nbe used with other than harmonic potentials. Here we show\nthat for a harmonic potential it confirms the expected result\nof simple harmonic motion.\nIn the 1D GPE, the norm N, and energy E, are conserved\nquantities. The single soliton solution of the homogeneous\ncase \u0003Eq. \u00015\u0002 with j=1\u0004 is used as an ansatz for the harmonic\ncase.

This proof follows the method given in Ref. \u000358\u0004.\nThe position shifts given in Ref. \u00035\u0004 are equivalent to the\nasymptotic time shifts for two solitons of initial speeds v1\nand v2, and effective masses \n1 and \n2, given by\n\u0011t = \u2212\n1\n2\u0001v1 \u2212 v2\u0002\n\u0005 1\n\n1\n+\n1\n\n2\n\u0007ln\u0005 \u0001v1 \u2212 v2\u00022 + 4\u0001\n1 + \n2\u00022\u0001v1 \u2212 v2\u00022 + 4\u0001\n1 \u2212 \n2\u00022\u0007 .\n\u0001D1\u0002\nWe wish to produce these shifts in a system of two clas-\nsical particles described by the Hamiltonian\nBRIGHT SOLITARY-MATTER-WAVE COLLISIONS IN A \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW A 77, 013620 \u00012008\u0002\n013620-13\nH\u00aa p\n2\n2\u000fr\n+ V\u0001q\u0002 , \u0001D2\u0002\nwhere q\u00aaq1\u2212q2 is the relative coordinate, \u000fr\u00aa\n1\n2 \/ \u0001\n1\n+\n2\u0002 is the reduced effective mass, p= \u0001\n1p2\u2212\n2p1\u0002 \/ \u0001\n1\n+\n2\u0002 is the relative momentum, and the center of mass has\nbeen separated from the problem.

If we also choose an initial condition such that\n\u0007\u0001x , t0\u0002=\u0019\u0001x , t0\u0002, it must therefore follow that \u0019\u0001x , t\u0002\n=\u0007\u0001x , t\u0002 for all t. In other words, parity is conserved in the\nsense that an initially symmetric wave function will have that\nsymmetry preserved throughout its subsequent dynamical\nevolution.\nIn this paper, the most important consequence of this re-\nsult is that a system of two identical solitons with equal and\nopposite velocities will repeatedly collide with the exact\nsame collisional form \u0001e.g., in phase or \u0012 out of phase\u0002 at the\nexact center of the trapping potential.
