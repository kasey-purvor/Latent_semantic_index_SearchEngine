INTRODUCTION\nThe odd-odd deformed nuclide 18075Re105 is located in the high-Z part of the well deformed\nA\u223c160\u2212180 region of the Segre` chart. Nuclei in this region have high-K orbitals close\nto the Fermi surface (where K is the spin projection on the symmetry axis). Broken-pair\nstates at modest excitation energies can have high K values and are able to compete with\ncollective rotation in the formation of the yrast line (the locus of states with lowest energy\nas a function of spin) [1, 2]. The approximate conservation of the K quantum number\nthen leads to long-lived isomers, exemplified by the \u03c4 = 45-year mean-life of a Kpi = 16+, 4-\nquasiparticle isomer in 17872Hf106 [3]. However, for different nucleon numbers the mean-lives of\nmulti-quasiparticle states are seen to decrease rapidly, due to a combination of less-favorable\nenergetics and increased K mixing [2]. Considering quasiparticle numbers \u22654 in the Z=76\nosmium isotopes, for example, the longest-lived isomers have mean-lives in the ns range,\nwhile \u00b5s isomers are known in the Z=75 rhenium isotopes 179Re [4] and 181Re [5]. The\npresent work is concerned with the study of isomers and associated structures in their odd-\nodd neighbor 180Re, which could give additional information about the robustness of the K\nquantum number.\nLow-spin states in 180Re have been studied previously through the electron-capture decay\nof 180Os [6\u20139]. The 180Re ground state is unstable, with \u03c4 = 3.5 minutes and a tentative\nspin and parity of (1)\u2212. It decays by electron capture to the stable nuclide 180W. The\nhigh-spin states of 180Re have been investigated twice [10, 11] in the past two decades,\nbut the experiments failed to agree on common spin, parity and configuration assignments,\neven for the low-lying states. The first experiment [10] used the 176Yb(10B,6n) reaction and\nobtained a level scheme up to high spin in which five rotational bands were identified and\ninterpreted as being part of 180Re, even though there were no connections with the low-spin\npart of the level scheme [8, 9]. A 4-quasiparticle isomer was also reported, with associated\nrotational bands. The second high-spin experiment [11] used two different beam and target\ncombinations, 181Ta(\u03b1,5n) and 170Er(14N,4n), and established the existence of six strongly\ncoupled rotational bands and a seventh band which showed a significant energy splitting\nbetween the sequences of different signature. The 4-quasiparticle isomer was confirmed and\nhigher-lying isomers were reported but not characterised. Again, connections with the low-\nspin states were not identified, and spin assignments remained tentative. The interpretations\n2\nof the two data sets [10, 11] differed substantially.\nThe structures of the 2-quasiparticle bands have been reinterpreted by Jain et al. [12].\nThe present work builds on this, reports new connections between the known bands, extends\nthose bands to higher spin, and identifies two 6-quasiparticle bands for the first time. Despite\nthese successes, connections with the low-spin states, populated in electron-capture decay,\nremain unidentified. Nevertheless, a consistent understanding of the high-spin level structure\nis provided, up to spin values of almost 30 h\u00af. The highest-lying isomer, with \u03c4=13\u00b11 \u00b5s, is\nassigned an Ipi=Kpi=21\u2212 six-quasiparticle structure. Its K-forbidden decay provides insight\ninto the persistence of the K quantum number. The present work supersedes a preliminary\nreport [13] of the 4- and 6-quasiparticle results.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nThe nuclide 180Re was populated up to spin \u223c30 h\u00af with a 71 MeV beam of 11B ions\nincident on a self-supporting 174Yb target of thickness 5 mg\/cm2. The choice of beam energy\nwas based on calculations using the code PACE [14], and by inspection of the experimental \u03b3-\nray spectra at different beam energies. Although the evaporation of five neutrons constituted\nthe main channel at 71 MeV, \u03b3 rays from other nuclides were also observed, principally 181Re\nand 179Re, via the 4n and 6n channels, respectively. The \u03b3-ray measurements were made\nusing the CAESAR detector array [15], consisting of six Compton-suppressed n-type coaxial\nHPGe detectors (with a BGO shield surrounding each detector) mounted at angles of \u00b148o,\n\u00b197o and \u00b1145o with respect to the beam axis, and two small-volume unsuppressed planar\nGe detectors (LEPS) at \u00b145o used for enhanced sensitivity to low-energy \u03b3 rays and X-rays.\nThe array was operated in both singles and coincidence mode.\nFor measuring conversion electrons, the Super-e electron spectrometer [16] was used, con-\nsisting of a superconducting magnet transporter and a Si(Li) detector with an antipositron\nba\ufb04e. This was operated in lens mode, with the ba\ufb04e system restricting the momentum\nacceptance. In the current work, two electron-energy ranges were studied, 200\u2212900 keV,\nand 400\u2212600 keV. To measure the \u03b3-ray spectrum simultaneously with the conversion elec-\ntrons, a Compton-suppressed HPGe detector was installed at 135o to the beam direction.\nEfficiency and energy calibrations were performed for each of the two experimental arrange-\nments (CAESAR and Super-e) using a 152Eu radioactive source at the target position.\n3\nA. Gamma-ray Measurements\nGamma-gamma coincidence measurements were performed with 1 ns beam pulses, 1.7 \u00b5s\napart. A total of 3\u00d7108 coincidence events were sorted into a variety of 4096\u00d74096-channel\nmatrices. For example, one matrix had the requirement that the \u03b3 rays occur within \u00b1 40\nns of each other. Another had the time relationship relaxed to \u00b1 170 ns, thus including\nlow-energy \u03b3 rays and X-rays, which can experience considerable time walk. Additional\nconditions that the events occur during the beam pulses, or between beam pulses, have been\nused. To study across-isomer correlations early-delayed matrices were constructed in two\ntime-difference regimes, 40-170 ns and 170-800 ns. Projection of those events that precede\nan isomer was achieved by gating on transitions that follow it, and vice versa.\nTwo three-dimensional matrices (cubes) were sorted for detailed time analysis. For states\ndepopulated by low-energy \u03b3 rays, a \u03b3-X-\u2206t cube was constructed, with HPGe-detector\nevents on one axis, LEPS events on the second axis, and the time difference between them\non the third axis. A corresponding \u03b3-\u03b3-\u2206t cube was also constructed. The background-\nsubtracted spectra were then obtained by projecting onto the time axis with gates on the\n\u03b3-rays which populated and depopulated the levels of interest. This enabled lifetimes in the\nns\u2192 \u00b5s range to be associated with specific states.\nIn order to measure longer lifetimes, separate measurements were performed with two\ndifferent \u00b5s-pulsing ranges. One was with the beam on for 7 \u00b5s and off for 107 \u00b5s, and the\nother with the beam on for 53 \u00b5s and off for 802 \u00b5s. Gamma-ray energies and their times\nrelative to the beam pulses were recorded in event-by-event mode, and two-dimensional\n\u03b3-time matrices were created.\nThe DCO (Directional Correlation of Oriented states) technique was used to aid spin\ndeterminations. The DCO ratio may be defined as [17]:\nRDCO =\nI\u03b3\n2\n\u03b81\n(Gate\u03b3\n1\n\u03b82\n)\nI\u03b3\n2\n\u03b82\n(Gate\u03b3\n1\n\u03b81\n)\n(1)\nwhere I represents the \u03b3-ray intensity, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles between each detector\nand the beam axis. DCO ratios were extracted for the present geometry with \u03b81 = 145\n0, and\n\u03b82 = 97\n0. If the two transitions in the cascade have the same multipolarity, then gating on\neither of them gives RDCO\u22481. However, gating on a stretched quadrupole transition gives\nRDCO\u22480.56 for a stretched dipole transition, and values ranging from RDCO\u22480.3 to \u22481.2\n4\nfor mixed M1\/E2 transitions, depending on the spin change and the size and sign of the\nmixing ratio. Measured DCO ratios are included in table I.\nB. Conversion-electron Measurements\nThe conversion-electron experiment was carried out using a pulsed beam, with 7 \u00b5s pulses\nseparated by 107 \u00b5s. Data were collected only in the off-beam period with the Si(Li) and\nHPGe detectors, and sorted into two matrices, one with electron energy against the time of\narrival relative to the beam pulse, and the other with the \u03b3-ray energy against time.\nThe electron events were subjected to momentum-selection criteria [16]. After recording\nthe full electron spectrum from the Si(Li) detector, events were selected which satisfy the de-\nfined relationship between the electron energy and the solenoid field. The energy-dependent\ntime response of electrons and \u03b3 rays was corrected, and matched spectra were produced.\nConversion coefficients were obtained directly from the ratios of efficiency-corrected electron\nand \u03b3-ray intensities.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nEleven rotational bands have been identified in the present work, based on 2-, 4-, and\n6-quasiparticle configurations. The level scheme is presented in two parts. Figure 1 shows 2-\nquasiparticle bands 1, 2 and 3, and Figure 2 shows 2-quasiparticle bands 3, 4 and 11 together\nwith the 4- and 6-quasiparticle bands. For clarity, band 3 is reproduced in both figures. The\n\u03b3-ray energies and intensities for transitions assigned to 180Re are listed in Table I, while\nconversion coefficients are listed in Table II. Representative singles spectra for conversion\nelectrons and \u03b3-rays are shown in Figure 3. In addition to the conversion coefficients obtained\ndirectly from the ratio of the electron and \u03b3-ray intensities, for low-energy transitions the\ntotal conversion coefficients have been extracted from transition intensity balances. The\ncoefficients are compared with theoretical values [18] to distinguish between electric and\nmagnetic characters. According to the general behavior of \u03b3-ray transition probabilities, only\nE1, M1 and E2 multipolarities need to be considered, except for transitions depopulating\nbandheads where significant lifetimes are measured. Strongly populated bands are assumed\nto be closer to yrast than more weakly populated bands. The K value of a rotational band\n5\nis usually taken to be the spin of the bandhead. An exception to this rule arises for bands\n1 and 2, where the K value is taken to be lower than the bandhead spin by 2 h\u00af and 1 h\u00af,\nrespectively (see later).\nThe level scheme presented in Figures 1 and 2 takes as its starting point bands 4 and\n11, interpreted by Jain et al. [12] to have Kpi = 8+ and Kpi = 9\u2212, respectively. In ref. [12] a\nseries of arguments was used to modify assignments given previously [10, 11]. Jain et al. [12]\nconsidered signature splittings, g-factors, systematics from neighboring nuclei, bandhead\nenergies (including residual interactions) and quasiparticle alignments, to establish reliable\nand consistent configurations for these 2-quasiparticle bands. Our experimental and theo-\nretical results (see Section IV) for bands 4 and 11 are in good accord with the conclusions\nof Jain et al., and hence these two bands used as the foundation for constructing the rest\nof the level scheme. Although they do not have experimental spin assignments, their struc-\ntures and spins are considered to be on firm ground, and parentheses are not used for their\nspins and parities in the following presentation. Rather, parentheses are used to distinguish\nassignments that are tentative relative to bands 4 and 11.\nNilsson configuration assignments are suggested in the following sections for each of the\nobserved rotational bands. These are proposed with the aid of multi-quasiparticle calcu-\nlations (discussed later) and in each case care is taken that the configuration should be\nconsistent both with the degree of rotational alignment and with the experimental g-factors.\nPlots of alignment as a function of rotational frequency are shown in Figure 4. Configura-\ntions which involve i 13\n2\n, 9\/2+[624] neutrons and h 9\n2\n, 1\/2\u2212[541] protons are strongly affected\nby the Coriolis force and have relatively large alignments at low rotational frequency.\nThe in-band \u03b3-ray branching ratios have been used to determine gK values from the\nrotational-model expressions:\n\u03b42\n1 + \u03b42\n=\n2K2(2I \u2212 1)\n(I + 1)(I +K \u2212 1)(I \u2212K \u2212 1)\n(\nE1\nE2\n)5\n\u03bb, (2)\ngK \u2212 gR\nQ0\n=\n0.933E1\n\u03b4\n\u221a\nI2 \u2212 1 (3)\nwhere \u03b4 is the E2\/M1 mixing ratio, E is the transition energy in MeV, \u03bb is the (\u2206I =\n2)\/(\u2206I = 1) \u03b3-ray transition intensity ratio, and gR is the rotational g-factor.

The free nucleon values of g\u03a3=\u22123.83 for neutrons and +5.59\nfor protons are attenuated by a factor of 0.6 [19], and Nilsson-model wavefunctions are used\nto determine the expectation values of the intrinsic-spin projections. Equation 2 assumes\na well defined K value and only yields the magnitude of \u03b4 and not its sign. In this work\nthe sign of (gK \u2212 gR) has not been determined, though positive signs have been previously\nobtained [11] from \u03b3-ray angular distributions for bands 3, 4, 8 and 11 (with Kpi = 7+, 8+,\n16+ and 9\u2212, respectively). Nevertheless, it is not straightforward to make a quantitative\ncomparison with the resulting g-factors from ref. [11] on account of the different K values\nthat have been used.\nThe measured | gK \u2212 gR | values are listed in Table III and compared with corresponding\ntheoretical values. There is reasonable agreement for all assigned bands (though not the\nunassigned Kpi = 4\u2212 option) providing support for the suggested configurations. The last\ncolumn in Table III lists cases where gK = 0.08 is used for i 13\n2\nneutrons [19], and gK = \u22121.0\nis used for h 9\n2\nprotons [20]. These values allow for alignment effects, and typically lead to\nimproved agreement with experimental values. At least part of the remaining discrepancies\ncan be attributed to the assumption of fixed gR = 0.30. As observed for multi-quasiparticle\nbands in, for example, 178W [21] and 179W [19], there is evidence that the neutron-proton\n15\nTABLE II: Conversion coefficients for selected transitions in 180Re\nE\u03b3 Shell \u03b1exp \u03b1th Multipolarity\n42.4 TOT a) 13(4) M1: 11.5 M1\n54.8 TOT a) 7(2) M1: 5.40 M1\n77.5 TOT a) 8.3(3) M1: 11.3 M1\n102.2 TOT a) 2.5(9) E2: 3.84 E2\n120.5 TOT a) 0.6(3) E1: 0.24; M1: 3.17 E1\n141.4 TOT a) 1.9(2) M1: 2.01 M1\n245.9 K 0.231(50) M1: 0.355; E2: 0.0981 M1\/E2\n275.9 K 0.190(25) M1: 0.258; E2: 0.0725 M1\/E2\n285.7 K 0.077(12) E2: 0.0662 E2\n307.4 K 0.107(20) M1: 0.194; E2: 0.0547 M1\/E2\n416.6 K 0.054(6) M1: 0.0860; E2: 0.0256 M1\/E2\n447.3 K 0.023(10) E2: 0.0216 E2\n456.8 K 0.0084(10) E1: 0.00759 E1\n474.3 K 0.026(6) E2: 0.0188 E2\n507.4 K 0.020(3) M1: 0.0514; E2: 0.0161 E2\nL 0.005(2) M1: 0.00797; E2: 0.00394\n599.7 K 0.012(2) E2: 0.0112 E2\n678.1 K 0.008(1) E2: 0.00857 E2\n1175.8 K 0.003(1) E2: 0.00287 E2\n1192.9 K 0.005(2) M1: 0.00593; E2: 0.00280 M1 or E2\na) Total conversion coefficient obtained from intensity-balance considerations.\nbalance in the configuration has a significant influence on gR.

It is found, for example,\nthat the 180Re low-frequency alignments are systematically \u223c2 h\u00af greater than their 178Ta\ncounterparts, a difference which may be understood qualitatively as arising from the smaller\n\u03b22 deformation of\n180Re, which leads to stronger Coriolis mixing.

Two-quasiparticle Bands\n1. Band 4, Kpi=8+, based on the 205 keV level\nBand 4 was observed up to spin (19+) at 3234 keV. The corresponding bandhead reported\nin ref. [11] was given a spin assignment of 6\u2212, in contrast to the 7+ assignment of Kreiner\net al. [10] and the 8+ assignment of Jain et al. [12]. As indicated above, the Jain et al. 8+\n17\nassignment is adopted here. There are two possible configurations: \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514]\u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514],\nand \u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c07\/2+[404]. Of these quasiparticles, only the 9\/2+[624] neutron gives\nsubstantial alignment. Therefore, the low aligned angular momentum of the observed band\nat low frequency (ix = 2h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1 MeV, see Figure 4) favors the former configuration,\nwhich has no aligned quasiparticles. The adopted configuration is the same as for the\nKpi=8+ band in 178Ta, which has | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.47 \u00b1 0.05 [20], compared to the 180Re\nvalue of 0.45 \u00b1 0.05. The alignment shows an initial upbend below h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.3 MeV, which\nis typically observed in this mass region [22] for i 13\n2\nneutron pair breaking. However, a\ncomplete alignment was not observed due to the lack of data on higher-spin states for this\nband. Note that band 8 (Kpi=16+), which is discussed later, has a related neutron (i 13\n2\n)2\nalignment.\n2. Band 11, Kpi=9\u2212, based on the 284 keV level\nBand 11 is assigned a bandhead spin of 9\u2212, based on the discussion of Jain et al. [12], which\nis consistent with our results. (Kreiner et al. [10] gave an 8\u2212 assignment, and Venkova et\nal. [11] gave a 7+ assignment.) Note that there is a 79 keV transition, assigned E1 character\n[11], from the 9\u2212 bandhead of band 11 to the 8+ bandhead of band 4, and all authors agree\non the relative spin and parity assignments of bands 4 and 11. Band 11 is now extended to\nspin (25\u2212). The bandhead is isomeric with a measured mean-life of 109\u00b12 ns (see Figure\n5). This is consistent with previous results [10, 11], though the uncertainty is now reduced.\nJain et al. [12] gave a configuration assignment of \u03bd9\/2+[624]\u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514], which is\nsupported by the present work. The initial alignment (Figure 4) of ix = 3.5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1\nMeV is consistent with the presence of an i 13\n2\nneutron in the configuration. We note that\nthere is competition between the 9\/2+[624] and 7\/2+[633] i 13\n2\nneutron orbitals, which are\nmixed by the Coriolis interaction. However, it is evident from the odd-N isotones 179W\n[19, 23] and 181Os [24] that the 9\/2+[624] neutron is at slightly lower energy for N=105. The\nband in 178Ta with the same configuration has | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.29\u00b1 0.03 [20], similar to the\n180Re value of 0.25\u00b1 0.03.\nThe alignment (Figure 4) shows a backbend at h\u00af\u03c9 \u22480.3 MeV, which is presumably due\nto the alignment of a pair of i 13\n2\nneutrons. Due to blocking, this alignment should be delayed\nin frequency relative to bands without an i 13\n2\nneutron in the initial configuration. In 180Re,\n18\nthere is no good test of this behavior. However, it can be seen that the alignment gain in\nband 4 (Kpi = 8+) begins at a lower frequency, as would be expected. Furthermore, these\n8+ and 9\u2212 bands in 180Re have properties that are similar to the corresponding 8+ and 9\u2212\nbands in 178Ta [20].\nAdditional excited states, found to decay into lower members of band 11, are at 1403 keV\n(12\u2212) and 1670 keV (13\u2212), the latter being newly placed in this work. The 1670 keV state\ndecays via a 1074 keV transition to the 595 keV, Ipi=11\u2212 level. The Ipi=(13\u2212) assignment is\nimplied because, when gating on the 1074 keV transition in the \u03b3\u2212\u03b3 matrix, transitions are\nseen that feed the 1755 keV, Ipi=15\u2212 level, which suggests that there is an unobserved and\nhighly converted (E2) 85 keV transition between the Ipi=15\u2212 state and the state in question.\nThe quasiparticle structures of the 1403 and 1670 keV levels are considered in Section IV.\n3. Band 2, Kpi=(4+), based on the ground state, and Band 3, Kpi=(7+), based on the 71 keV\nlevel\nBands 2 and 3 were previously reported in ref. [11]. These two structures are connected\nby strong interband transitions which help in determining the energy and spin differences.\nAn unobserved 25 keV transition is implied [11], depopulating the bandhead of band 3. Non-\nobservation as a \u03b3-ray is not surprising since an M1, 25 keV transition has a large conversion\ncoefficient (\u03b1TOT=55). In the present work, a 45.8 keV transition has been established at\nthe bottom of band 2 (see Figure 6). This transition was reported in ref. [10] but not placed\nin their level scheme.\nBand 3 was assigned a 3\u2212 bandhead by Venkova et al. [11]. This clearly conflicts with\nour connection (see Figure 2) to band 4, which was not identified by Venkova et al. [11],\nalthough they inferred the existence of a 42 keV transition on the basis of \u03b3-ray coincidence\nrelationships. Intensity considerations for the 42.4 and 134.5 keV transitions from band 4\nto band 3 imply M1 multipolarities, and hence a 7+ bandhead for the latter. Furthermore,\nthe transitions between bands 2 and 3 can be explained as being due to a crossing of\nthe bands at \u2248700 keV excitation energy, characterised by chance near degeneracies and\nwavefunction mixings, as discussed in more detail in Section IV. The crossing requires equal\nspin and parity values for the 696 and 716 keV levels in the respective bands, and Ipi=11+\nis therefore specified for these two levels to give consistency with the band 3 assignment\n19\nalready discussed.\nBand 2 forms two separate signatures (E2 sequences) above spin 10+, in the sense that\nthe \u2206I=1 transitions are of too low intensity to be observed. In band 3 on the other\nhand, the mixed dipole-quadrupole transitions are more intense relative to the stretched E2\ntransitions. Several additional transitions have been observed in these bands, compared to\nprevious work [10, 11].\nBand 3 is assigned the Kpi=7+, \u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402] configuration in accord with\nref. [10]. The configuration for band 2 is suggested to be \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514] \u2297 \u03c01\/2\u2212[541] with a K\nvalue (4+), which is less than the bandhead spin (5+) on account of the aligned 1\/2\u2212[541]\nproton that is involved. The initial alignment value of 4 h\u00af (see Figure 4) supports the\npresence of this orbital.\nIn ref. [12], bands 2 and 3 were assigned different configurations, with Kpi = 3+ and\nKpi = 4+ respectively, but this was largely due to incomplete experimental information. It is\nfurther noted that for band 2 there is a corresponding structure in 178Ta, which was assigned\nKpi=4+ [20], with | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.18 \u00b1 0.02. This compares well with the 180Re value of\n0.14\u00b1 0.02.\nThe lowest level identified in band 2 forms the effective ground state of the high-spin\npart of the 180Re level structure, as elaborated in the present work. There is no connection\nfound with the level structure determined from \u03b2 decay [6\u20139]. Furthermore, the assigned\n5+ member of the band is not necessarily the bandhead, as there could be an additional\ntransition from the 5+ state with a low energy (\u223c30 keV) to which the present experiment\nis insensitive. Nevertheless, this would have no direct impact on the other spin, parity and\nconfiguration assignments discussed in this work, which use bands 4 and 11 as their basis.\n4. Band 1, Kpi=(5\u2212), based on the 178 keV level\nTwo linked sequences of \u03b3-ray transitions, corresponding to the present band 1, were\npreviously identified [11] up to the 582 keV (16 \u2192 14) and 748 keV (21 \u2192 19) transitions.\nThe bandhead de-excitation, however, was not established. In ref. [11], this band was\nassigned to 180Re on the basis that it could not be associated with either of the neighboring\nisotopes 181Re [24] and 179Re [25], although the strongest transitions from this band were\nunresolved from \u03b3 rays emitted from both isotopes. In the present work, band 1 is confirmed\n20\nas belonging to 180Re on the basis of coincidences observed with the 45.8 keV transition in\nband 2, and the lowest member of band 1 decays to band 2 through a tentatively identified\n132.0 keV transition. This transition was observed in prompt coincidence with the strong\ntransitions in band 1, see Figure 7. However, with five transitions assigned to 180Re in the\nenergy range 132.0-134.5 (see Table I) a firm placement of the 132.0 keV transition has\nnot been possible. (Figure 7 also shows the presence of a 324.1 keV transition which was\nreported in ref. [11], and is still unplaced in the present level scheme.)\nIt remains problematical to determine the spin for the lowest level, at 178 keV, identified\nin band 1, because it might not be the bandhead, i.e. there could be additional unobserved\ntransitions that are at low energy and highly converted. In this circumstance, transition\nintensity balancing cannot be used to determine the multipolarity of the 132 keV transition.\nNevertheless, a spin change of one unit is implied, giving band 1 spins that are consistent\nwith those of Venkova et al. [11]. However, we note that the systematics discussed more\nrecently by Venkova et al. [26] favor assignments that are one spin unit higher. This could\nbe made consistent with the present work by the insertion of a low-energy (unobserved)\nin-band transition at the bottom of the band, which would require the whole band to be\nshifted up by that transition energy.\nBand 1 in ref. [11] was given a \u03bdi 13\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0h 9\n2\nassignment, i.e. \u03bd9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c01\/2\u2212[541].\nThese two nucleons can couple to Kpi=4\u2212 or 5\u2212, the former being energetically favored by\nthe Gallagher-Moszkowski rules [27], although both nucleons are strongly affected by Coriolis\nmixing. Figure 4 shows that the alignment of this band is the largest of the 2-quasiparticle\nbands in 180Re, about 5 h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1 MeV. Due to the strong Coriolis mixing, the K value\nis not well defined. However, the label Kpi=(5\u2212) is adopted since the simple g-factor analysis\nfavors this value (see Table III). The K value is less than the apparent bandhead spin of 7\u2212,\na feature that may be associated in particular with the h 9\n2\n, 1\/2\u2212[541] proton, as with band\n2.\nB. Four-quasiparticle Bands\nFour rotational bands (numbers 5, 6, 7 and 8) built on 4-quasiparticle intrinsic states\nhave been observed in 180Re. These bands were also reported in ref. [11], but, with the\nexception of band 8, they were not extended to high spin, and there are differences in the\n21\nbandhead decays. Due also to the reassignments of bands 4 and 11 (discussed above) new\nspin, parity and configuration assignments for the 4-quasiparticle bands are proposed in the\npresent work. The four bands decay mainly via the 13+ isomeric level at 1566 keV, the\nbandhead of band 5, into both bands 4 and 11. In optimising the statistical accuracy for\nthe 13+ bandhead lifetime, double energy gates were set (see Figure 8) on \u03b3-ray transitions\nbelow the 13+ bandhead and above the 16+, 1876 keV bandhead. It was found that, in\naddition to the 107\u00b12 ns mean-life for the 13+ bandhead (see next section) it was necessary\nto include an additional component with a mean-life of 7\u00b11 ns. However, it was not possible\nto determine to which one or more of the three intermediate bandheads (14\u2212, 15\u2212 or 16+)\nthis should be ascribed. Accordingly, we consider that each intermediate bandhead has\n\u03c4 < 8 ns.\n1. Band 5, Kpi=13+, based on the 1566 keV level\nBand 5 has an isomeric bandhead with a mean-life of 107\u00b12 ns (see Figure 8). The\nisomer was previously identified in both refs. [10, 11], with consistent lifetimes, though the\npresent measurement has a smaller uncertainty. The multipolarities of some of the isomeric\ntransitions are listed in Table II. The conversion coefficient of the 678.1 keV transition\nis measured to be \u03b1K=0.008(1), which establishes its E2 character and leads to the I\npi =\nKpi = 13+ assignment for the isomer. At least four quasiparticles are needed to provide such\na high K value, and the excitation energy of 1566 keV is consistent with the energy required\nto break one additional nucleon pair relative to the 2-quasiparticle states. The associated\nrotational sequence (band 5) is very weakly populated and is tentatively placed in the level\nscheme (Figure 2).\nBand 5 is suggested to have the configuration \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297\n\u03c05\/2+[402]. The alignment value (Figure 4) ix = 3.5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV, is consistent\nwith the involvement of a single i 13\n2\nneutron. This relatively low alignment and non-yrast\nlocation, compared to the higher-K 4-quasiparticle bands, can explain its weak population.\n22\n2. Band 6, Kpi=14\u2212, based on the 1700 keV level\nBand 6 decays by a 134.1 keV transition to the 13+ bandhead, and by an 895.3 keV\ntransition to the 12\u2212 state of band 11. The total conversion coefficient for the 134.1 keV\ntransition indicates E1 character [11], hence Ipi=14\u2212 for the bandhead. The band is assigned\nthe configuration \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],7\/2+[633] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402]. The alignment of ix = 5.5h\u00af\nat h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV (Figure 4) is consistent with the involvement of two i 13\n2\nneutrons.\n3. Band 7, Kpi=15\u2212, based on the 1755 keV level\nThe assignment of Kpi=15\u2212 to band 7 is based on the new placement of the 54.8 keV\ntransition, which was reported in ref. [11] and tentatively identified as coming from an iso-\nlated isomeric level, though the lifetime was not measured and the band associated with it\nwas not seen. It is now established that band 7 is associated with the 54.8 keV transition\n(see Figure 9). It was not possible to establish a lifetime associated specifically with the 54.8\nkeV transition but an upper limit of \u03c4 < 8 ns can be set. The isomeric nature previously\nattributed to the corresponding level in ref. [11] is understood to be due to a higher-lying\nlong-lived isomer (see later for more details). From intensity balancing, the 54.8 keV tran-\nsition has \u03b1TOT=7\u00b12 which strongly suggests M1 (\u03b1TOT=5.4) rather than E2 (\u03b1TOT=59.4)\nor E1 (\u03b1TOT=0.38) character, thereby establishing a bandhead spin of 15\n\u2212.\nThe proposed configuration is \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514]. Another\nKpi=15\u2212 state is also possible, from the \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],7\/2+[633] \u2297 \u03c07\/2+[404] con-\nfiguration. In this case the relatively small alignment of ix = 4h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV favors\nthe former configuration, involving a single i 13\n2\nneutron. The relatively low alignment is\nconsistent also with the weak population of the band. A comparable Kpi=15\u2212 band has\nalso been observed in 178Ta [20] with a similar | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 (compared with\n0.18\u00b1 0.09 for 180Re). A different configuration mixing was discussed in that case, though\nwith the same dominant structure.\nIt is also notable that band 7 is crossed by band 6, and the unfavored members of band 7\nare not identified above the crossing. Further discussion of the crossing is given in Section IV.\nThis interpretation provides additional evidence in support of the proposed level structure\nand the relative spin and parity assignments. Indeed, in our preliminary report [13] bands\n23\n6 and 7 were swapped (relative to what is now presented) but the identification of the 319\nkeV \u03b3-ray as an interband transition now removes the ambiguity.\n4. Band 8, Kpi=16+, based on the 1876 keV level\nBand 8 decays to the 15\u2212 bandhead by a 120.5 keV transition with \u03b1TOT=0.6\u00b10.3 (see\nTable II) which implies an E1 assignment (\u03b1TOT=0.24) hence I\npi=16+ for the bandhead\nof band 8. A configuration assignment of \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],7\/2+[633] \u2297 \u03c09\/2\u2212[514] is\nsuggested. The presence of two i 13\n2\nneutrons is consistent with the high initial bandhead\nalignment of ix = 5.5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV (see Figure 4). The adopted configuration is the\nsame as for the Kpi=16+ band in 178Ta, which has | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.10\u00b1 0.01 [20], compared\nto the 180Re value of 0.16\u00b1 0.03.\nThe structure of band 8 is related to that of band 4 with the addition of a neutron\n(i 13\n2\n)2 excitation, where the 9\/2+[624] and 7\/2+[633] neutrons are coupled to K\u22488. This is\nthe so-called t-band structure, which was first identified in 179W [19], an isotone of 180Re.\nWhile in 179W the 3-quasiparticle t-band crosses its respective 1-quasiparticle g-band, in\n180Re the 4-quasiparticle, Kpi=16+ t-band is already energetically favored compared to its\ncorresponding 2-quasiparticle, Kpi=8+ \u201cg-band\u201d, so that no crossing can take place. In\nprinciple, given sufficient interaction between these two bands, a 164-keV, E2 transition\nmight be observable from the Kpi=16+ bandhead to the 14+ member of the Kpi=8+ band,\nbut this has not been identified in the present work. A remarkably similar situation exists\nin 178Ta [20], where the corresponding E2 interband transition would have an energy of 190\nkeV.\nThe energy differences between the t- and g-bands in the N=105 isotones 178Ta and 180Re,\ncompared to 179W, can be understood to arise from two factors. First, due to the higher\nspins in the odd-odd isotones from the additional quasiparticle, the rotational energies are\ngreater, favoring the \u2206K\u22488, t-band excitation. Second, the residual interactions with the\nodd proton give additional favoring to the t-band configuration. Hence, it may be concluded,\nthe g\u2212 t bandcrossing observed in 179W is absent in 178Ta and 180Re, because the respective\nt-bands are already energetically favored at their bandheads.\n24\nC. Six-quasiparticle Bands\nTwo new bands, numbers 9 and 10, are assigned to 180Re. These are associated with a\nhigh-lying isomer for which initial evidence was reported in ref. [11]. A mean-life of 13\u00b11\n\u00b5s has now been measured, as illustrated in Figure 10. The principal decay path of the\nisomer is by a 456.8 keV transition (see Figure 9) to band 8. The isomer decays through two\nother routes. One is to a state at 3408.4 keV via an unobserved 62.9 keV transition. (This\ntransition could not be separated from the intense 61.1 keV K\u03b11 X-rays of\n180Re.) The other\ndecay route is via a 102.2 keV transition, illustrated in Figure 11, to a state at 3369.1 keV\nwhich decays in turn via an 1164.1 keV transition to the Ipi=17\u2212 member of band 11.\n1. Band 9, Kpi=21\u2212, based on the 3471 keV level\nBand 9 is built on the 13 \u00b5s isomeric state and decays to the 20+ state of band 8 via a\n456.8 keV transition (see Figure 9) which is found to be of E1 character from its directly\nmeasured conversion coefficient of \u03b1K = 0.0084 \u00b1 0.0010. Deduction of this conversion\ncoefficient was complicated by the fact that 177Ta [28], which was significantly populated,\nhas a 456.7 keV transition below an isomeric level of comparable mean-life (8.6\u00b10.3 \u00b5s) to\nthat of the 456.8 keV transition in 180Re. However, the K binding energy differences result\nin conversion lines which are partially resolved, hence component electron intensities can be\nobtained, see Figure 12. The corresponding \u03b3-ray intensities can be determined with the aid\nof \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidences. With implied E1 character for the 456.8 keV transition, the bandhead\nof band 9 is assigned Ipi=Kpi=21\u2212.\nMulti-quasiparticle calculations (see Section IV) indicate that there are two competing\nconfigurations, with the required spin and parity, which could be assigned to the 21\u2212 state\nat 3471 keV:\n\u03bd 9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c0 5\/2+[402], 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404], 1\/2\u2212[541], 11\/2\u2212[505]; and\n\u03bd 7\/2\u2212[514], 9\/2+[624], 5\/2\u2212[512] \u2297 \u03c0 5\/2+[402], 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404].\nThe second of these involves only one aligning quasiparticle and is favored by the relatively\nlow alignment of the band, ix = 5h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV, as seen in Figure 4. The weak\npopulation of the band is also consistent with its low alignment.\n25\n2. Band 10, Kpi=(22+), based on the 3895 keV level\nBand 10 feeds into the 13\u00b11 \u00b5s isomer via a 424.0 keV transition (see Figure 13). In\nthe absence of a significant lifetime, the 424 keV transition is tentatively assigned dipole\ncharacter, and the bandhead of band 10 is assigned I=(22). Consequently, there is a crossing\nbetween bands 9 and 10 at I=25, with close-lying states of equal spin. The lack of interband\ntransitions or significantly perturbed energy levels suggests that the two bands have opposite\nparities, hence band 10 is tentatively assigned positive parity.\nMulti-quasiparticle calculations predict a low-lying 22+ state with the configuration\n\u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],7\/2+[633],9\/2+[624] \u2297 \u03c05\/2+[402],9\/2\u2212[514],7\/2+[404]. The involvement of two\ni 13\n2\nneutrons gives extra alignment compared to band 9 and is consistent with the observed\nvalue of ix = 6h\u00af at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.15 MeV (see Figure 4). This leads to the crossing with band 9,\ndespite band 10 being unfavored at its bandhead, and it furthermore explains the relatively\nstrong population of band 10. Indeed, band 10 extends to the highest spin, I=(29), identified\nin 180Re.\nA similar band has been found in 178Ta [20] with the same configuration assignment. As\nwith the other corresponding bands in these two isotones, the alignment in the 180Re band is\nabout 2 h\u00af higher than in the 178Ta band. However, the g-factors seem to differ significantly.\nThe 178Ta band has | gK \u2212 gR |= 0.25\u00b1 0.04, compared to 0.12\u00b1 0.06 for the 180Re band.\nThe latter value has a large percentage uncertainty arising from the band\u2019s weak population,\nand improved accuracy would clearly be needed for a more discriminating comparison.\nD. Other States\nThe ability to measure \u03b3-\u03b3 coincidences in between beam pulses gives great sensitivity\nto transitions that follow isomeric decays. Combined with the high spin, I=21, of the 6-\nquasiparticle isomer in 180Re, the method enables several non-yrast high-spin states to be\nidentified, as illustrated Figure 2. In the absence of rotational bands associated with these\nstates, the possible configuration assignments cannot be reliably determined.\nThe 62.9 keV transition from the 21\u2212 bandhead (band 9) and the 84.5 keV transition from\nthe 15\u2212 bandhead (band 7) are not themselves observed, but their existence is required by the\n\u03b3-ray coincidence relationships. The spins and parities of the various states are determined\n26\nthrough their connections to the bands already discussed, by intensity flow considerations\nwith corresponding conversion-coefficient constraints, and by directly measured conversion\ncoefficients.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe level scheme for 180Re is discussed in a selective way in the following sections. After\nan analysis of the low-spin bandcrossing, bandhead excitation energies are compared with\nmulti-quasiparticle calculations, and finally the hindrances of the K-forbidden decays are\nexamined.\nA. Bandcrossings\nIt has been established that there are several \u03b3-ray transitions between bands 2 and 3,\nindicating an interaction between the two bands. Figure 14 depicts the crossing in a plot of\nexcitation energy versus spin, including also the other 2-quasiparticle bands. The interaction\nmatrix element, V, is evaluated with the usual two-band-mixing approach (see, for example,\nref. [21]) making use of the in-band\/out-of-band B(E2) ratios. The intrinsic (unperturbed)\ntransition matrix elements are taken from the rotational model. The interaction has been\ncalculated for two cases, see Table IV, first with equal K for both bands, and second with\ndifferent K values. It is clear that the different-K assumption gives better consistency for\nthe calculated interaction strengths, with an average value of V=7.3\u00b10.4 keV. This is in\naccord with the assigned K values discussed earlier. Figure 15 illustrates the level energy\ndifferences \u2206E(I\u2192I\u22121)\/2I versus spin, showing both the perturbed (experimental) values\nand the unperturbed values (with the interaction removed). This representation is sensitive,\nin the form of odd-even staggering, to interactions between bands. It is seen that a constant\ninteraction matrix element of V=7.3 keV produces smooth curves for the unperturbed bands\nin the I=11 crossing region. This analysis thus provides a good description of the crossing\nbetween bands 2 and 3, including the interband transition strengths, and gives support to\nthe validity of the relative spin and parity assignments.\nThere is another bandcrossing. Band 6 crosses band 7, but the continuation of band 7\nis not observed. Mixing is indicated by the presence of the 319.2 keV transition from the\n27\nTABLE IV: Mixing matrix elements between bands 2 and 3 in 180Re.\nIpii E\u03b3 (keV) I\u03b3 V (keV)\na) V (keV) b)\n13+ 416.4 54(11) \u2212 c) \u2212 c)\n435.6 102(23)\n13+ 508.3 8(2) 7.23(5) 7.71(5)\n489.2 55(10)\n12+ 410.6 45(20) 6.59(12) 7.34(12)\n382.4 174(36)\n11+ 383.7 86(15) 9.08(14) 6.91(14)\n333.3 65(15)\n11+ 352.5 11(3) 4.90(12) 7.59(12)\n403.4 38(7)\na) Calculated with equal K for both bands.\nb) Calculated with K=7 for band 3 and K=4 for band 2.\nc) No solution found.\nIpi=19\u2212 member of band 6 to the Ipi=18\u2212 member of band 7 (see Figure 2). Figure 16 shows\nthe energy-versus-spin diagram for the 4- and 6-quasiparticle bands in 180Re, including bands\n6 and 7, for which the approach to bandcrossing is evident. However, the weak population\nof bands 6 and 7, and the non-observation of the unfavored states above the crossing, make\nthe mixing strength difficult to quantify.\nB. Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations\nThe proposed quasiparticle configurations for the bands in 180Re have been calculated\nusing two separate methods. The first method, discussed in this section, is that of K. Jain\net al. [32], based on the Nilsson model and BCS pairing with blocking by quasiparticle\nexcitations. A full set of near-yrast multi-quasiparticle states was calculated. In this process,\nempirical single-particle energies were used for states close to the Fermi surface, estimated\nfrom 1-quasiparticle energies, where available, in neighboring odd-mass nuclei (179Re, 181Re\n28\nfor protons, and 179W, 181Os for neutrons [33]). In order to produce the correct average\nparticle number the Fermi level was recalculated for each configuration. The monopole\npairing force was G\u03bd =\n21.5\nA\n= 0.119 MeV for neutrons and Gpi =\n22.5\nA\n= 0.125 MeV for\nprotons, and the deformation parameters were \u01eb2 = 0.232 and \u01eb4 = 0.047 [31]. The proton\nand neutron levels were treated separately to create their multi-quasiparticle states, and\nthen the two were combined. Residual interactions were also taken into account, using the\nempirical 2-quasiparticle Gallagher-Moszkowski splittings [27, 34] according to the method\nof K. Jain et al. [32]. The resultant multi-quasiparticle energies can then be compared with\nthe experimental values.\nGenerally good agreement is found between theoretical and experimental 2-, 4- and 6-\nquasiparticle energies as seen in Table V (compare the columns \u201cCalc.III\u201d and \u201cExpt.\u201d)\nwith the notable exception of the Kpi=21\u2212 state. The energy calculated for this level (resid-\nual interactions included) is higher than the experimental energy by 378 keV. (In the case\nof 178Ta, the corresponding calculated energy, with Lipkin-Nogami pairing, was in good\nagreement [20].) The reason for the discrepancy in 180Re may be partly due to the simple\nBCS treatment of pairing, and partly due to the fixed-deformation constraint in the calcu-\nlations. There is a significant discrepancy (>200 keV) also for the 2-quasiparticle Kpi=5\u2212\nbandhead. Both of these cases are predicted (see next section) to have large quadrupole\ndeformations. The Kpi=5\u2212 configuration could be a special case due to large Coriolis mixing\nand the proximity of the favored Kpi=4\u2212 coupling (see also Section III). The configurations\nare summarised in Table III.\nA graphical comparison between calculated and experimental energies is given in Figure\n17, including additional low-lying multi-quasiparticle states. The following observations can\nbe made:\n(i) Calculated Kpi = 13\u2212 and 12\u2212 states have reasonable correspondence with the experi-\nmental states at 1670 and 1403 keV, respectively (see Figure 2). These both have the config-\nuration \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],1\/2\u2212[521] \u2297\u03c09\/2\u2212[514], with maximal K=13 in one case, and\nK=12 from the opposed orientation of the 1\/2\u2212[521] neutron in the other.\n(ii) Additional calculated states with Kpi = 14+ and 15\u2212 are illustrated, with no correspond-\ning experimental states. These predictions appear to be reasonable, in that their higher\nexcitation energies are consistent with their non-observation experimentally.\n(iii) A Kpi = 19\u2212 state is calculated at 2704 keV, with the configuration\n29\n\u03bd7\/2\u2212[514],9\/2+[624],7\/2+[633] \u2297\u03c09\/2\u2212[514],5\/2+[402],1\/2\u2212[541]. This might possibly cor-\nrespond to the higher-energy experimental level at 3369 keV (see also next section).\nC. Potential Energy Surface Calculations\nPotential-energy-surface (PES) calculations using the configuration-constrained method\nof Xu et al. [35] have been used as a second approach for understanding the multi-\nquasiparticle states. In this approach, the Woods-Saxon potential (with no adjustment\nof single-particle energies) and Lipkin-Nogami pairing were used. For each quasiparticle\nconfiguration, the occupied orbitals were fixed and the quadrupole and hexadecapole defor-\nmations, \u03b22, \u03b3 and \u03b24, were varied in order to minimise the excitation energy. (Note that\n\u01eb2 \u2248 0.94\u03b22.) The neutron and proton monopole pairing strengths were determined by the\naverage gap method [36] with a 10% enhancement [35]. Due to the additional complexity\nof this method, only selected 180Re multi-quasiparticle states were calculated, with results\ngiven in Tables III and V. The calculated excitation energies agree satisfactorily with the\nexperimental results, and are broadly consistent with the Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations.\nThe variable-shape PES method gives substantially better agreement for the experimental\nKpi = 5\u2212 and 21\u2212 energies, with large calculated \u03b22 values. Furthermore, the K\npi = 19\u2212\nstate that has a low energy of 2704 keV from the Nilsson-plus-BCS calculations (discussed\nabove) has also been calculated with the PES method. It is predicted to lie at 3340 keV,\nwhich is close in energy to the observed (19\u2212) level at 3369 keV.\nOverall, the combination of a more realistic potential, a better treatment of pairing, and\nvariable shape, combine to make the PES calculations more reliable than the Nilsson-plus-\nBCS calculations.\nD. K-Forbidden Transitions\nThe projection, K, of the total angular momentum on the symmetry axis is approximately\na good quantum number for deformed axially symmetric nuclei. This defines the K-selection\nrule for electromagnetic transitions, \u2206K \u2264 l, for multipolarity l. In practice, transitions\nwhich violate this selection rule are hindered rather than forbidden, due to K-mixing mecha-\nnisms. A measure of the inhibition can be expressed by the hindrance factor, FW = \u03c4\n\u03b3\/\u03c4W ,\n30\nTABLE V: Properties of 180Re bandheads (see also Table III).\nBand Kpi Deformations a) Energy (keV)\n\u03b22 \u03b24 |\u03b3\u25e6| Calc.I a) Calc.II b) Calc.III c) Expt.d)\n1 5\u2212 0.246 \u22120.031 0.0 270 468 503 178\n2 4+ 0.215 \u22120.030 0.0 60 253 178 0\n3 7+ 0.224 \u22120.044 0.2 60 214 111 71\n4 8+ 0.240 \u22120.034 0.6 80 167 217 205\n11 9\u2212 0.224 \u22120.033 0.2 190 382 311 284\n5 13+ 0.242 \u22120.040 0.2 1560 1697 1558 1566\n6 14\u2212 0.229 \u22120.043 0.0 1600 1661 1567 1700\n7 15\u2212 0.239 \u22120.030 0.2 1670 1864 1722 1755\n8 16+ 0.224 \u22120.033 0.3 1710 1829 1751 1876\n9 21\u2212 0.247 \u22120.025 0.1 3350 4187 3849 3471\n10 22+ 0.267 \u22120.027 0.2 3740 4152 3890 3895\na) PES calculations using the method of Xu et al.

In refs [37, 38] it was found that f\u03bd\u2248100\nfor a range of \u03bd and l, so that for each additional unit of \u2206K, transitions are hindered by an\nadditional factor of about 100. This situation is well illustrated [39] by the decay of high-K\nisomers in 178Hf, which is arguably located at the center of the K-isomer region [2]. However,\nmany transitions have also been found in the same region with f\u03bd<<100, see for example\nrefs [19, 40\u201345], giving valuable information about the way that K mixing takes place. Since\n180Re is on the high-Z side of this K-isomer region, the reduced hindrance values may shed\nfurther light on the K-mixing mechanisms.\nOne transition of particular note with regard to K-forbidden transitions is the 1164 keV,\n31\n(19\u2212) to 17\u2212 transition from the 3369 keV level. Although of low intensity it is well estab-\nlished, as demonstrated in Figure 11. Considering, tentatively, the (19\u2212) level as an intrinsic\nstate with Kpi=19\u2212, the 1164 keV transition would have E2 character and change the K value\nby 10 units, i.e. it would be highly K forbidden, with \u03bd=8, bypassing the intermediate-K\nstructures. Due to the low population intensity and the feeding through the 13 \u00b5s isomer,\nthe lifetime of the 3369 keV level has a relatively poor constraint of \u03c4<100 ns, obtained\nfrom the observed coincidence between the 1164 keV transition and the 102 keV feeding\ntransition. Nevertheless, this limit indicates a significantly small reduced hindrance value,\nf\u03bd<4.4. Such a low value may be related to the location of the (19\n\u2212) level relatively far\nfrom the yrast line, which is broadly consistent with the systematic behavior discussed by\nWalker et al. [2, 46].\nMore definite information can be obtained for K-forbidden transitions with known (par-\ntial) half-lives. Table VI lists the transitions in 180Re from the 4- and 6-quasiparticle isomers\nwith Kpi=13+ and 21\u2212, respectively. Note that for E1 transitions two values are given, the\nsecond with \u03c4W multiplied by 104 before recalculating f\u03bd , to account for the generally strong\nE1 hindrance compared with other multipolarities [47, 48]. The final reduced-hindrance val-\nues vary between 17 and 66.\nThe E2 reduced-hindrance value for the 678 keV transition from the Kpi=13+ isomer,\nf\u03bd = 17, may now be compared with systematic behavior in the A\u2248180 region. In previous\nwork, K-forbidden E2 and E3 reduced hindrances from 4- and 5-quasiparticle isomers have\nbeen compared, through their inverse correlation with excitation energy relative to a rigid\nrotor, indicating a level-density dependence in the degree of K mixing [2, 46, 49]. The data\nare shown in Figure 18, with the odd-odd nuclides [20, 50\u201352] specifically indicated. It has\nbeen suggested [53] that the large reduced hindrance for 178Ta may be related to neutron-\nproton configuration mixing. In any case, the 180Re value is in relatively good agreement\nwith the trend of the other data. This supports the proposition that level density plays a\ncritical role in K mixing, though the sizeable scatter of the data also indicates the importance\nof other degrees of freedom [2].\nIn Figure 19, the yrast line is compared with the excitation energies of intrinsic states.\nFollowing from the above discussion, states which lie well above the yrast line are expected\nto have more K admixtures than the near-yrast states, and hence lower f\u03bd values. In\n180Re,\nboth the Kpi = 13+ and 21\u2212 isomers are not too far from yrast and the f\u03bd values are\n32\nTABLE VI: K-forbidden transitions in 180Re.\nKpii \u03c4 E\u03b3 l I\u03b3 \u03b1TOT B(\u03c3l) \u03bd f\u03bd\n(keV) a) (e2fm2l for El) b)\n(\u00b52\n\u25e6\nfm2l\u22122 for Ml)\n21\u2212 13(1) \u00b5s 62.9 E1 53(18)c) 0.260 3.6(15) \u00d710\u22128\n102.2 E2 21(10) 3.84 4.2(25) \u00d710\u22123\n456.8 E1 118(10) 0.009 2.1(6) \u00d710\u221210 4 315(19) 31.5(19)\n13+ 107(2) ns 141.4 M1 38(10) 2.01 2.0(6) \u00d710\u22125 4 20.5(14)\n163.1 E1 60(8) 0.109 1.15(17) \u00d710\u22126\n262.4 E1 38(7) 0.033 1.7(4) \u00d710\u22128 3 490(40) 22.7(15)\n416.6 M1 198(15) 0.103 2.1(2) \u00d710\u22126 4 30.5(8)\n523.5 E1 60(9) 0.007 3.5(6) \u00d710\u22129 3 840(50) 38.9(22)\n678.1 E2 169(23) 0.011 1.3(2) \u00d710\u22122 3 16.8(9)\n761.0 E1 38(5) 0.003 7.1(11) \u00d710\u221210 3 1420(70) 66(4)\naFrom Table I.\nbIncluding an additional factor of 104 in hindrance before the evaluation of f\u03bd\ncFrom 285.7 keV transition intensity.\nsubstantial.\nIt is notable that 180Re is the only odd-odd rhenium isotope known to display K isomerism\nfor a 6-quasiparticle state. Neighboring 179Re has recently been found to contain a 7-\nquasiparticle isomer [4]. While this also decays by transitions with substantial f\u03bd values,\nuncertainty in the isomer spin assignment makes the interpretation ambiguous in that case.\nV. SUMMARY\nIn the present work, eleven rotational bands in 180Re have been observed and characterised\nby \u03b3-ray and electron spectroscopy. The bands have been extended to higher spin compared\nto previous studies. Amongst the 2-quasiparticle bands, new connecting transitions have\nenabled significant improvements to be made in the organisation of the level scheme, leading\nto revised spin and parity assignments, and hence to a revised interpretation. This builds\n33\non the theoretical analysis of the 2-quasiparticle bands by Jain et al. [12].\nThe present work provides a new and detailed bandcrossing analysis of 2-quasiparticle\nbands 2 and 3. The properties of a 4-quasiparticle t-band are compared with related struc-\ntures in the N=105 isotones. Two bands are identified above a 6-quasiparticle, \u03c4=13 \u00b5s iso-\nmer. Configuration assignments are given for all the bands, supported by multi-quasiparticle\ncalculations, alignments and g-factors.\nThe 4- and 6-quasiparticle isomers in 180Re are found to decay by K-forbidden transitions.\nThe substantial reduced-hindrance values, 17\u2264f\u03bd\u226466, are most likely related to the near-\nyrast location of the isomers.\nAcknowledgements: The ANU technical staff are thanked for their excellent support.\nThis work has been performed under an ANU\u2212EPSRC agreement.
