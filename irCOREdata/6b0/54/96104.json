I show that, if the sex ratio of each patch is maintained at exactly 1:1, and the two sexes are symmetric (i.e. they have the same death rates and the sex ratio at birth is 1:1), the results for the asexual model described in the main text will continue to hold exactly. I go on to explain why they will not, in general, hold exactly if the sex ratio in a patch can drift away from 1:1, but they will become a progressively more accurate approximation to optimal behaviour as the number of members N for each patch increases. Sex ratio fixed at 1:1 Relatedness calculations apply to autosomal genes. The population is again defined by the parameters N, k, v and \u03c9. The patch destruction and colonisation rate \u03c9 has the same meaning as before. Suppose that the number of individuals N in each patch is an even number and the sex ratio is maintained at 1:1, so that an individual reproduction and mortality event involves either a female replacing a female or a male replacing a male. Then each patch always has N\/2 females and N\/2 males. The probability per unit time for an individual to be killed in an individual replacement event is as before k, having the same value for both females and males, whilst the probability per unit time for becoming the parent of a newborn is 2k. These assumptions lead to the same individual and patch survival functions as for the asexual case (expressions 2.1 and 2.2 in the main text). The dispersal level is v, as in the asexual model,. It will be assumed that dispersal occurs after fertilisation, i.e. it is zygotes or young individuals which disperse, not gametes. As in the asexual model, R will denote the mean relatedness of an individual to other members of its patch including itself, and ROTH will denote the mean relatedness of an individual to other members of its patch excluding itself. Consider a new member of the focal organism\u2019s patch. As for the asexual case, there is a probability (1- v) that its parents are from the home patch. Given that the parents are from the home patch, there is a probability 2\/N that the focal organism is one of its parents, resulting in a relatedness of (1 + ROTH)\/2 to the newborn, and a probability (1 \u2013 2\/N) that the focal organism is not a parent of the newborn, resulting in a relatedness ROTH. This yields the recurrence relationship ROTH = (1- v)[(2\/N)(1 + ROTH)\/2 + (1 - 2\/N)ROTH] which is the same as (2.4) in the main text. Hence relatedness is the same as for the asexual case (2.4 and 2.5 in the main text).. In considering fitness values of different benefits, for this sexual population a reproductive benefit a to the focal organism itself means an amount of reproduction equivalent to producing a diploid copies of itself, and hence 2a offspring to which it is one parent (with the other parent being one of the other members of the patch). With respect to expected gene frequencies, this is equivalent to asexual reproductive output of a by the focal organism plus asexual reproductive output of a by a random other member of the patch. But the net effect on the focal organism\u2019s fitness of additional reproductive output by another member of the patch is zero, as discussed in section 4(c). It follows that the fitness effect of becoming a sexual parent to an expected additional 2a offspring is equivalent to additional asexual output of a, and therefore (4.1) will continue to hold. Now consider additional reproductive output equivalent to b diploid young, where the parents are chosen at random from all members of the patch including the focal organism. Then the fitness benefit is the expected proportion of this output which disperses, multiplied by the relatedness to the focal organism, so that (4.2) again holds. As both (4.1) and (4.2) continue to hold for the sexual case, and relatedness is unchanged (2.4 and 2.5), it follows that (4.3) will again hold. For an immediate colonisation benefit, expression (4.4) holds again, using exactly the same argument as in section 4(d) of the main text. A delayed reproductive benefit to the focal organism will be discounted, as in the main text, according to the individual survival function si(\u03c4), and as si(\u03c4) is the same as for the asexual model, the individual discount rate is again given by (4.7). Relatedness on the patch to the focal organism decays, as in the asexual case, due to dispersal and the risk of patch destruction. The arguments of section 4(g) are unchanged, giving expression (4.8) as before for relatedness RE(\u03c4) of the focal organism to the patch conditional on the patch not having suffered catastrophic destruction during the delay but not conditional on the focal organism remaining alive. Similarly, expressions (4.9) and (4.10) for unconditional relatedness RU(\u03c4) of the focal organism to the patch remain the same. The arguments of section 4(h) and 4(i) for the fitness value of delayed benefits to the patch remain as before, yielding the same social discount rate (4.13) as for the asexual case. Turning to the case of enforced collective social action, all the expressions in section 4(k) apply again to the sexual case, resulting in the same social discount rate (4.18) under enforced collective social action. Sex ratio allowed to drift Assume now that the sex ratio is no longer fixed at 1:1 but is allowed to drift. The most parsimonious population process under which this will happen is that all members of a patch have an equal probability of death in a replacement event, with the newborn having a 50% chance of being female and a 50% chance of being male, regardless of the current sex ratio in the patch. A detailed analysis of the resulting dynamics and fitness-maximising preferences depends on additional assumptions, such as: how does the mean per-capita reproduction rate depend on the sex ratio? And: can an organism condition its preferences (and hence its behaviour in binary choice problems) according to the current sex ratio? Whatever detailed assumptions are made, however, if the sex ratio is allowed to drift then there will be a finite proportion of patches in which all the individuals are of the same sex. In a same sex patch, a newborn must have dispersed in from another patch, whatever the nominal value of v for the population. But there is a probability of 0.5 that the newborn will be of the same sex as the other patch members, in which case the next newborn must also disperse in from another patch. This indicates that, for the population as a whole, there will be a statistical correlation in the probability that successive newborns in a patch have dispersed in from other patches. But the recurrence relationship for relatedness (expression 2.4) is based on the assumption that there is a constant (independent) probability v that each newborn in a patch is dispersed in from outside, regardless of the origins of the previous newborn. This assumption also underpins the exponential decay of relatedness RE(\u03c4) and RU(\u03c4) to the focal organism with delay (expressions 4.8 and 4.9). It follows that (4.9) will no longer hold exactly, meaning that the expression for the social discount rate (4.13) is no longer valid. However, random drift in the sex ratio on a patch will be less important as N increases. If the possible dependence of changes in the probability per unit time for individual replacement events on the sex ratio is ignored, then the number of females on a patch of size N will follow an approximately binomial distribution of the form B(N, 0.5), so that the standard deviation in the proportion of females in a patch becomes smaller as N becomes larger. That is, as N increases optimal behaviour will approximate progressively closely to the results for the asexual population.","cites":null},{"id":17253244,"title":"Economics and the evolution of life histories.","authors":[],"date":"2003","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1733942100","raw":"Rogers, A.

A social investment today may yield a\nstream of future benefits. Choosing between such an\ninvestment and an alternative action that yields only\nimmediate benefits is a difficult problem. It is normal in\nsuch public policy dilemmas to discount future social\nbenefits (Goulder & Stavins 2002), with the effect that a\npotentially indefinite social benefit stream is given a finite\npresent value. The choice of the social discount rate has\na bearing on public policy decisions involving costs and\nbenefits at different times (Dasgupta & Heal 1974;\nGupta et al. 1996; Atherton & French 1998; Pearce et al.\n2003). A lower social discount rate tends to favour more\nenvironmental protection and restoration (Gupta et al.\n1996). Conversely, more rapid discounting implies more\nrapid consumption of both non-renewable and renewable\nresources and can lead to extinction of the latter (Clark\n1973; Dasgupta & Heal 1974).\nWhat is the rationale for allocating progressively lower\nweights to benefits from social investments further into\nthe future? One possible reason is the risk of a future\nevent that will bring to an end the social benefit stream\narising from the investment. This could take the form of\na catastrophe that wipes out the community in which\nthe investment is located (Dasgupta & Heal 1979), or\nsimply a development that renders a social investmentu@lse.ac.uk\nic supplementary material is available at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.\nb.2009.0401 or via http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org.\n7 March 2009\n28 April 2009 2955redundant or causes it to stop working (Rambaud &\nTorrecillas 2005). In addition to such risk, however,\nthere is another consideration: how should a risk-free wel-\nfare gain or loss by members of the community at some\npoint in the future be valued against a risk-free welfare\ngain or loss by members of the community today? Some\nauthors regard it as axiomatic, for moral reasons, that\nthe welfare of all people, present and future, should be\naccorded the same weight in public policy decisions\n(Broome 1994). However, decisions can be expected to\ntake account of the welfare of future people only to the\nextent that decision makers care about future people\n(Marglin 1963). A simple population analysis indicates\nthat, as long as present-day decision makers give some\npositive weight to the welfare of future members of\nthe community, the social discount rate will be lower\nthan the private discount rate for individual benefits\n(Sumaila & Walters 2005). But this leaves open the\nquestion of exactly what weighting should be used.\nThe present study considers social discounting as a\ngeneral problem in evolutionary biology, applicable to\norganisms that live in viscous populations with limited\ndispersal. It is concerned with the following question:\nwhat social discount rate would result from natural selec-\ntion? This raises a more basic question: why should an\norganism, governed by its selfish genes, care about the\nfuture welfare of its community? A possible answer\ncomes from the biological theory of kin selection: if wel-\nfare gains translate to improved survival or reproductive\nsuccess, then, other things being equal, selection will\ntend to favour behaviours that result in welfare gains to\nrelatives. If, additionally, geographical proximity is\nassociated with a positive level of relatedness (Hamilton\n1975; Manica et al. 2005), and there is some degree of\nlong-term persistence to this association, evolution mayThis journal is q 2009 The Royal Society\n2956 P.

This can be understood\nby reference to the principle that altruism can evolve\nwhere there is some form of assortment within the popu-\nlation so that altruists are more likely to be recipients of\naltruistic benefits than are non-altruists (Fletcher &\nDoebeli 2009). Lehmann (2007) has shown that, in a\npatch-structured semelparous population with discrete\ngenerations, this effect can lead to selection for altruistic\nacts whose effects last for several generations. The present\nstudy takes this approach further by deriving explicit time\npreferences for both individual and social benefits, for\nan iteroparous patch-structured population facing\ntrade-offs in continuous time. It establishes that natural\nselection will favour two distinct discount rates, with\nthe individual discount rate generally being higher than the\nsocial discount rate.\nThis analysis of social discounting arising from the\ninclusive fitness value to an organism of delayed benefits\nto its community contrasts with the idea that individual\ndiscounting is mediated by the capacity to make transfers\nto specific relatives (Barro 1974; Rogers 1994). General\ntransfers within a kin group have been modelled for situ-\nations in which any conflict of interest between donor and\nrecipient is ignored (Hansson & Stuart 1990; Kaplan &\nRobson 2002; Lee 2003; Robson & Kalpan 2003) which\nis equivalent to a donor treating recipients as full kin with\na relatedness of one (Rogers 2003), and for situations in\nwhich the level and pattern of transfers is exogenously\ndetermined (Lee 2008). The present study, however, is\nconcerned with trade-offs involving immediate or delayed\nbenefits to self or local community; the decay over time\nof expected relatedness to an organism of members of its\nlocal community is critical to the analysis.2. POPULATION MODEL\nConsider an infinite population occupying discrete\npatches, each patch containing a fixed number N of indi-\nviduals. The population is asexual (a sexual population is\nconsidered in the electronic supplementary material). It is\ngoverned by a Moran-type dynamic process with individ-\nuals and entire patches subject to random replacement\nevents, whereby an individual or patch is duplicated and\nreplaces (i.e. kills) another individual or patch, as follows:\nIndividual reproduction and mortality event: an individual\nis duplicated; with probability v, the duplicate disperses to\na different patch, chosen at random, and kills and replaces\na random member of that patch, and with probability\n(12v), the duplicate kills and replaces a member of its\nown patch, chosen at random from the N members\nincluding its parent.\nPatch colonization and destruction event: an entire patch\nis duplicated and replaces one of the other patches,\nchosen at random.\nAt equilibrium, each member of the population has an\nindividual reproductive rate (probability per unit time for\nindividual reproduction) of k. The individual mortality\nrate from the risk of being replaced in such an event is\nalso k. Each patch has a colonization rate (probability\nper unit time for being duplicated and taking over another\npatch) of v. The rate for a patch to be wiped out in aProc. R. Soc. B (2009)destruction event, i.e. colonized by another patch, is\nalso v.\n(a) Survival functions\nAn organism\u2019s probability si(t) of surviving a delay t with-\nout being killed through either individual mortality or\ndestruction of its patch is\nsi\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc exp\u00f0\u0002\u00f0v\u00fe k\u00det\u00de: \u00f02:1\u00de\nThe probability sp(t) of a patch surviving a delay t\nwithout suffering a patch-level destruction event is\nsp\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc exp\u00f0\u0002vt\u00de: \u00f02:2\u00de(b) Relatedness\nFor this asexual population, the relatedness of two indi-\nviduals is the probability that they are identical. R is the\nrelatedness at equilibrium of an individual to all members\nof its patch including itself. ROTH is the relatedness of an\nindividual to an individual in its patch other than itself.\nThe two measures are related by\nR \u00bc \u00f01=N\u00de \u00fe ROTH\u00f0N \u0002 1\u00de=N\nor\nROTH \u00bc \u00f0NR\u0002 1\u00de=\u00f0N \u0002 1\u00de: \u00f02:3\u00de\nConsider a newborn in an equilibrium population.

But this relatedness can also be calcu-\nlated as follows: with probability v, the newborn\u2019s parent\nis from another patch and its relatedness to the compari-\nson member is zero. With probability (12v), the\nnewborn\u2019s parent is from the same patch; if so, then\nwith probability 1\/N the comparison member is the\nparent and the newborn\u2019s relatedness to the compa-\nrison member is 1, and with probability (121\/N), the\ncomparison member is not the parent and the newborn\u2019s\nrelatedness to the comparison member is ROTH.

PREFERENCES\nI assume that each organism sporadically faces choices\nover options involving small immediate or delayed\nbenefits to itself or to its patch. The analysis below deter-\nmines the preferences that are favoured by natural\nselection, i.e. the preferences that maximize inclusive\nfitness. As the total population does not grow, this should\nbe understood as maximizing relative inclusive fitness.\nConsider preferences from the point of view of a single\norganism, denoted as the focal organism. I assume that the\nfocal organism\u2019s inclusive fitness gain from a small benefit\nis proportional to the benefit level, and that multiple\nbenefits have an additive effect on inclusive fitness. The\nproblem faced by the focal organism can be conceptual-\nized as a (multidimensional) trade-off over the various\nxy optimum choice\nFigure 1. A hypothetical trade-off between two benefits. For\na given level of any one of the two benefits, the focal organ-\nism would prefer more of the other. However, its choices are\nconstrained to lie along the trade-off curve so that it cannot\ngain more of one without getting less of the other. If a unit\nincrease in x has the same effect on fitness as an increase\nof two units in y, then fitness is maximized by maximizing\n(x + 2y).

The levels of the two\nbenefits are denoted by x and y. At a given value of x\nthe focal organism would prefer a larger value of y, and\nat a given value of y it would prefer a larger value of x.\nIts choices, however, are constrained to lie along the\ntrade-off curve, so that it cannot get more of one benefit\nwithout less of the other.\nPreferences, defined by rates of substitution between\nalternative benefits, are determined by the ratio of mar-\nginal increments to inclusive fitness for the focal organism\nfrom each benefit. Figure 1 illustrates a situation in which\na unit increase in x has the same effect on inclusive fitness\nas an increase of two units in y. Inclusive fitness is\nmaximized by maximizing the value of (x \u00fe 2y). At the\noptimum choice, the tangent to the trade-off curve has\na slope of 22.\n(a) Discounting\nDiscounting depends on how the gain to inclusive fitness\nfrom some benefit due after a delay declines as a function\nof delay (Sozou 1998), with the instantaneous time-\npreference rate (Rogers 1994; Sozou & Seymour 2003)\nu given by the proportional rate of decline of inclusive fit-\nness value with delay (figure 2). For what follows, uIND is\nthe individual discount rate, i.e. the time-preference rate\nfor a benefit to the focal organism itself. Immediate and\ndelayed benefits to a patch can arise from patch members\nacting either independently or through enforced joint action\narising from the focal organism\u2019s independent action.\nThe social discount rate uSOC is the time-preference rate\nfor benefits to the focal organism\u2019s patch. The group\nsocial discount rate uSOC,GROUP is the time-preference\nrate for a benefit to the focal organism\u2019s patch arising\nfrom a collective action that is enforced among all\nmembers of the patch.Proc. R. Soc. B (2009)4. ANALYSIS\nTo derive inclusive fitness-maximizing preferences,\nincluding individual and social discount rates, it is necess-\nary to calculate the inclusive fitness consequences of\ndifferent possible benefits, either to the focal organism\nor to its patch, for immediate or delayed benefits. The\neffect of a particular benefit on the inclusive fitness of\nthe focal organism is given by the expected increase in\nthe number of copies of the focal organism in the popu-\nlation arising from the benefit, as described in Taylor\n(1992). A given benefit is described by three parameters:\nthe type of benefit, its magnitude, and the delay before\nthe benefit is due. The expected inclusive fitness gain\nfor the focal organism is written as w(type of benefit,\nsize of benefit, delay). Three types of benefit are con-\nsidered: a reproductive benefit to the focal organism\nitself, denoted by repSELF; a reproductive benefit to a\nrandom member of the focal organism\u2019s patch, denoted\nby repPATCH; and a colonization benefit to the focal\norganism\u2019s patch, denoted by colPATCH.\n(a) Immediate reproductive benefit to self\nConsider a small amount a of immediate reproduction\nrealized immediately by the focal organism. This can be\nconstructed as a temporary increase of magnitude Dk and\nduration dt in its reproduction rate, withDk dt \u00bc a. It results\nin a probability a that the organism will produce an\nadditional offspring; if this additional offspring is produced,\nthenwith probability v this offspringwill disperse to another\npatch, and with probability (12v) it will stay on the home\npatch, displacing another individual of expected relatedness\nR.

With probability v, this offspring\ndisperses to another patch, giving an inclusive fitness\ngain R to the focal organism; with probability (12v),\nthis offspring remains on the patch, displacing another\nindividual of relatedness R to the focal organism and\ntherefore giving an inclusive fitness gain of zero.

Thus, the net effect on the focal\u2019s inclusive fitness is\nfully captured by the change to its own net reproductive\nrate; the net inclusive fitness effect of changes in the repro-\nductive output of other members of its patch is zero. It\nfollows that, in this model, the focal organism should not\nbe willing to sacrifice some of its own reproduction to\neither increase or reduce the reproductive output rate of\nother members of its patch, as has been shown for a semel-\nparous infinite patch-structured population (Taylor 1992)\nand for semelparous (Rousset 2004) and iteroparous\n(Taylor et al. 2007) populations on finite networks (and it\nhas been shown (Lehmann et al. 2007) that a number of\nevolutionary graph theory models can be understood\nthrough classic inclusive fitness theory). This is a conse-\nquence of local competition counteracting local kinship\n(Grafen 1984; Wilson et al. 1992).\n(d) Immediate colonization benefit to patch\nConsider a small amount c of additional colonization rea-\nlized immediately by the focal organism\u2019s patch.

A new member in its patch\ncould be: its own offspring, which will increase its mean\nrelatedness to members of its patch; or the offspring of\nanother member of its patch, which will leave expected\nrelatedness unchanged; or an arrival from another\npatch, which will decrease its mean relatedness to mem-\nbers of its patch. The tendency for the first process to\nincrease relatedness is balanced by the tendency for the\nthird to decrease it. But if the focal organism dies, the\nfirst process ends and so relatedness to it of members of\nthe patch will tend to decrease over time. It follows that\nif relatedness is calculated from a perspective that is not\nconditional on the focal organism remaining alive, it will\ndecline over time.\nLet RE(t) be the expected relatedness of other mem-\nbers of the patch to the focal organism as a function of\ndelay, conditional on the patch not having suffered cata-\nstrophic destruction during the delay but not conditional\non the focal organism remaining alive. The individual\nmortality rate is k. A mortality event causes a patch\nmember of expected relatedness RE to the focal organism\nto be replaced by an immigrant of relatedness 0 with\nprobability v, and by an existing patch member of\nexpected relatedness RE with probability (12v).

This is the unconditional relatedness denoted by\nRU(t). With probability sp(t), the patch will not suffer\ndestruction during the delay and the relatedness at delay\nt will be RE(t).

However, social behaviour may instead\nbe enforced (Frank 1995); in a modern human society,\nfor example, this may take the form of prohibition of\nanti-social activities such as improperly dumping waste.\nLet wGROUP be the fitness gain to the focal organism\nfrom an action that is adopted by all members of the\npatch and enforced. I assume that the focal organism\nhas, probabilistically at least, some influence over the\nchoice of action, so that natural selection acts on its pre-\nferences for this action. Consider first a collective action\nresulting in each member of the patch enjoying an\nimmediate individual reproductive benefit a. The fitness\ngain for the focal organism arises from the proportion v\nof this increased reproduction, from N patch members\nof relatedness R to the focal organism, which disperses:\nwGROUP\u00f0repSELF; a; 0\u00de \u00bc aNRv: \u00f04:14\u00de\nConsider now a collective action such that each\nmember of the patch generates immediate additional\nreproduction b by a random member of the patch.\nAgain, the net fitness gain for the focal organism arises\nfrom the proportion of increased reproduction that dis-\nperses and is given by\nwGROUP\u00f0repPATCH; b; 0\u00de \u00bc bNRv: \u00f04:15\u00de\nComparing equations (4.14) and (4.15), the focal\norganism\u2019s fitness gain from a collective and enforced\ndecision is greater if each patch member\u2019s actions contrib-\nute b to a random member than if each member\u2019s actions\ncontribute a to its own reproduction if b . a. This is more\neasily satisfied than equation (4.3), i.e. behaviour will\ntend to shift in the direction of acts that benefit the\npatch rather than the individual.\nNow consider a collective and enforced decision such\nthat each patch member\u2019s action contributes a reproduc-\ntive benefit b to a random member of the patch after a\ndelay t, realization of this being conditional on the\npatch not suffering destruction during the delay. This\ngives a probability sp(t) of a total reproductive benefit\nNb to recipients of expected relatedness RE(t) to the\nfocal organism.

DISCUSSION\nLehmann (2007) showed that it may be adaptive for an\norganism to act in a way that produces future benefits to\nits community, if there is a statistical tendency for future\nmembers of its community to be its kin. The present\nstudy develops this insight further by evaluating how an\norganism should value future benefits to itself or to its\ncommunity. This leads to the determination of two separ-\nate discount rates. The individual (private) discount rate\napplies to delayed benefits to the organism itself; the con-\ncept of an individual discount rate has been applied in\nevolutionary biology at least as far back as Fisher (1930).\nThe social discount rate applies to delayed benefits to the\norganism\u2019s community; this is a familiar concept in\neconomics and philosophy (in relation to human commu-\nnities) (e.g. Marglin 1963; Broome 1994), but has not\nhitherto been considered explicitly in evolutionary biology.\nThis study shows how the social discount rate is relevant\nto understanding how an organism should choose bet-\nween actions resulting in different costs or benefits to its\ncommunity at different times.\nIndividual and social discount rates are calculated for a\nsimple modelled asexual population of organisms in\ndiscrete patches with limited dispersal, subject to both indi-\nvidual mortality and patch destruction random events. The\nindividual discount rate (expression 4.7) is equal to the\nsum of an organism\u2019s hazard rate for its patch to be\ndestroyed and the hazard rate for it to suffer an individual\nmortality event, and is therefore equal to its overall death\nrate. The social discount rate is governed by the decay of\nexpected relatedness to the focal organism of a member\nof its community chosen at random at some future time\n(expression 4.10), and is equal to the organism\u2019s hazard\nrate for its patch to be destroyed plus the product of the\nhazard rate for it to suffer an individual mortality event\nand the dispersal level (expression 4.13). The social\ndiscount rate is lower than the individual discount rate,\nexcept in the case of no population viscosity\u2014i.e. a disper-\nsal level of 100 per cent\u2014when the two discount rates are\nthe same. If patches are long-lived relative to individual life\nexpectancy (Sherwood 2007), and the dispersal level is low,\nthe social discount rate will be much lower than the\nindividual discount rate in ratio terms.Proc. R. Soc. B (2009)The electronic supplementary material shows that the\nderived results apply exactly to a sexual population, as\nlong as there are no sex differences in birth and death\nrates and the sex ratio is maintained at exactly 1 : 1 in\neach patch. If the sex ratio in a patch can drift away\nfrom 1 : 1, the results no longer apply exactly, but they\nwill be an increasingly good approximation to optimal\nbehaviour as patch size increases.\nThere is no direct dependence of the social discount rate\non the number of individuals N in each patch. This may\nseem counterintuitive. For the present model, the dispersal\nlevel v and patch destruction rate v are taken as given, i.e.\nthey are treated as exogenously specified parameters of the\nmodel. It would not be unreasonable to assume, however,\nthat a larger patch size may be associated with a lower\nlevel of dispersal or a lower patch destruction rate; explicitly\nputting such a relationship into the model would lead to a\nlower social discount rate with increasing patch size. This\nconsideration would be important in a model that con-\nsidered a population comprising patches of different sizes,\nbut is beyond the scope of the present model.\nA change from independent individual action to\nenforced collective action does not change the social\ndiscount rate (compare expressions 4.13 and 4.18). This\nmay again seem counterintuitive: enforced collective\naction will tend to result in a shift towards more socially\nbeneficial action (Hardin 1968). The social discount rate,\nhowever, is determined by the relative gain from delayed\nsocial benefits as compared with immediate social benefits.\nEnforced collective action will tend to increase social\ninvestment for both immediate and delayed community-\nwide gains, but the relative gain from a delayed benefit as\ncompared with an immediate benefit remains the same.\nA key assumption in this framework is that the delayed\nsocial benefits being considered are benefits to a local\ncommunity. The meaning of \u2018local\u2019 is somewhat flexible\nwith respect to general application of the theory. What\nmatters is that there is some relevant sense in which a\ndelayed benefit helps locals in preference to non-locals:\nevolution is ultimately driven by competition.\nPreferences that imply positive valuation of future social\nbenefits, asmodelled here, are likely to be found in biological\nsystems comprising long-lived groups within which there is a\nnon-negligible level of relatedness. For example, a pathogen\u2019s\nsuccess in spreading through a population of host organisms\nmay depend in part on how the pathogen influences the\nfuture condition of a host it has infected (Frank 1992;\nNowak &May 1994; Gandon et al. 2002). If the importance\nto the pathogen\u2019s success of this influence diminishes with\ndelay, and this is reflected in the pathogen\u2019s strategy, then\nthe pathogen may be said to exhibit social discounting.\nTo what extent is this analysis relevant to understand-\ning social discounting in people? There are several\nconsiderations that may limit the direct application of\nthese results to humans. In particular, the model assumes\na simple population structure; the population is assumed\nto be homogeneous with respect to both individuals and\npatches; there is no scope for local population growth or\ndecline; and individuals do not age. But insofar as\nhumans have tended to live in long-lived groups or\nlocalities in which local kinship endures over time scales\nlonger than the human lifespan, it seems plausible that\nsome sort of future-valuing social preferences of the\nform considered here may have been selected in humans.\nIndividual and social discounting P. D. Sozou 2961\n on 13 July 2009rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from What of a social discount rate for decisions that impact\non the whole population, rather than a locality or specific\ngroup? This question arises, for example, in the problem\nof global climate change. In the absence of competition\nbetween planets, there is no basis for behaviours that\nbenefit the planet as a whole to be directly adaptive,\nand therefore no evolutionary basis for directly determin-\ning a social discount rate for global welfare. This seems to\nlead to a puzzle: why do people care at all about the long-\nterm welfare of humanity as a whole? People may have\nevolved preferences for positive valuation of long-term\ngeneral social welfare in ancestral environments in which\nsuch preferences would have mainly or always influenced\nactions with only local effects, and that therefore would\nhave helped kin. But in the modern, global environment,\nsuch preferences may cause people to care about global\nproblems such as climate change.6. CONCLUSIONS\nThis study has derived analytical results for the individual\nand social discount rates that would arise through natural\nselection in a patch-structured iteroparous population\nwith limited dispersal. The modelled population is not\nintended to be a realistic representation of any specific\norganism. Rather, it provides a simple framework\nallowing analytical results for the fitness consequences\nof different behaviours to be derived. These results yield\ninsights into how individual mortality, community\ndestruction and dispersal influence individual and social\ndiscount rates. In real organisms, individual and social dis-\ncounting behaviour is likely to depend on a number of\nother factors, such as local ecological conditions and\nenvironmental variability; an organism\u2019s age; whether or\nnot the population of the local community is growing;\nsocial structure within a community; and the spatial and\nnetwork structure of communities. The last of these factors\nraises the possibility of several social discount rates\ncorresponding to different levels of community organization\nwithin certain forms of population structure. Detailed\nrepresentation of these considerations will require more\ncomplex models. However, it is likely that the insights\ncontained in the simple model presented here will carry\nover to models of greater complexity.This work was supported by the London School of\nEconomics.

I \nshow that, if the sex ratio of each patch is maintained at exactly 1:1, and the two sexes are \nsymmetric (i.e. they have the same death rates and the sex ratio at birth is 1:1), the results for the \nasexual model described in the main text will continue to hold exactly. I go on to explain why they \nwill not, in general, hold exactly if the sex ratio in a patch can drift away from 1:1, but they will \nbecome a progressively more accurate approximation to optimal behaviour as the number of \nmembers N for each patch increases. \n \nSex ratio fixed at 1:1 \nRelatedness calculations apply to autosomal genes. The population is again defined by the \nparameters N, k, v and \u03c9. The patch destruction and colonisation rate \u03c9 has the same meaning as \nbefore. Suppose that the number of individuals N in each patch is an even number and the sex ratio \nis maintained at 1:1, so that an individual reproduction and mortality event involves either a female \nreplacing a female or a male replacing a male. Then each patch always has N\/2 females and N\/2 \nmales. The probability per unit time for an individual to be killed in an individual replacement event \nis as before k, having the same value for both females and males, whilst the probability per unit time \nfor becoming the parent of a newborn is 2k. These assumptions lead to the same individual and \npatch survival functions as for the asexual case (expressions 2.1 and 2.2 in the main text). The \ndispersal level is v, as in the asexual model,. It will be assumed that dispersal occurs after \nfertilisation, i.e. it is zygotes or young individuals which disperse, not gametes. As in the asexual \nmodel, R will denote the mean relatedness of an individual to other members of its patch including \nitself, and ROTH will denote the mean relatedness of an individual to other members of its patch \nexcluding itself. \nConsider a new member of the focal organism\u2019s patch. As for the asexual case, there is a \nprobability (1- v) that its parents are from the home patch. Given that the parents are from the home \npatch, there is a probability 2\/N that the focal organism is one of its parents, resulting in a \nrelatedness of (1 + ROTH)\/2 to the newborn, and a probability (1 \u2013 2\/N) that the focal organism is not \na parent of the newborn, resulting in a relatedness ROTH. This yields the recurrence relationship \nROTH = (1- v)[(2\/N)(1 + ROTH)\/2 + (1 - 2\/N)ROTH] \nwhich is the same as (2.4) in the main text. Hence relatedness is the same as for the asexual case \n(2.4 and 2.5 in the main text).. \nIn considering fitness values of different benefits, for this sexual population a reproductive \nbenefit a to the focal organism itself means an amount of reproduction equivalent to producing a \ndiploid copies of itself, and hence 2a offspring to which it is one parent (with the other parent being \none of the other members of the patch). With respect to expected gene frequencies, this is \nequivalent to asexual reproductive output of a by the focal organism plus asexual reproductive \noutput of a by a random other member of the patch. But the net effect on the focal organism\u2019s \nfitness of additional reproductive output by another member of the patch is zero, as discussed in \nsection 4(c). It follows that the fitness effect of becoming a sexual parent to an expected additional \n2a offspring is equivalent to additional asexual output of a, and therefore (4.1) will continue to \nhold. \nNow consider additional reproductive output equivalent to b diploid young, where the \nparents are chosen at random from all members of the patch including the focal organism. Then the \nfitness benefit is the expected proportion of this output which disperses, multiplied by the \nrelatedness to the focal organism, so that (4.2) again holds. As both (4.1) and (4.2) continue to hold \nfor the sexual case, and relatedness is unchanged (2.4 and 2.5), it follows that (4.3) will again hold. \nFor an immediate colonisation benefit, expression (4.4) holds again, using exactly the same \nargument as in section 4(d) of the main text. A delayed reproductive benefit to the focal organism \nwill be discounted, as in the main text, according to the individual survival function si(\u03c4), and as \nsi(\u03c4) is the same as for the asexual model, the individual discount rate is again given by (4.7). \nRelatedness on the patch to the focal organism decays, as in the asexual case, due to \ndispersal and the risk of patch destruction. The arguments of section 4(g) are unchanged, giving \nexpression (4.8) as before for relatedness RE(\u03c4) of the focal organism to the patch conditional on the \npatch not having suffered catastrophic destruction during the delay but not conditional on the focal \norganism remaining alive. Similarly, expressions (4.9) and (4.10) for unconditional relatedness \nRU(\u03c4) of the focal organism to the patch remain the same. The arguments of section 4(h) and 4(i) for \nthe fitness value of delayed benefits to the patch remain as before, yielding the same social discount \nrate (4.13) as for the asexual case. \n \nTurning to the case of enforced collective social action, all the expressions in section 4(k) \napply again to the sexual case, resulting in the same social discount rate (4.18) under enforced \ncollective social action. \n \nSex ratio allowed to drift \nAssume now that the sex ratio is no longer fixed at 1:1 but is allowed to drift. The most \nparsimonious population process under which this will happen is that all members of a patch have \nan equal probability of death in a replacement event, with the newborn having a 50% chance of \nbeing female and a 50% chance of being male, regardless of the current sex ratio in the patch. A \ndetailed analysis of the resulting dynamics and fitness-maximising preferences depends on \nadditional assumptions, such as: how does the mean per-capita reproduction rate depend on the sex \nratio? And: can an organism condition its preferences (and hence its behaviour in binary choice \nproblems) according to the current sex ratio? Whatever detailed assumptions are made, however, if \nthe sex ratio is allowed to drift then there will be a finite proportion of patches in which all the \nindividuals are of the same sex. In a same sex patch, a newborn must have dispersed in from \nanother patch, whatever the nominal value of v for the population. But there is a probability of 0.5 \nthat the newborn will be of the same sex as the other patch members, in which case the next \nnewborn must also disperse in from another patch. This indicates that, for the population as a \nwhole, there will be a statistical correlation in the probability that successive newborns in a patch \nhave dispersed in from other patches. But the recurrence relationship for relatedness (expression \n2.4) is based on the assumption that there is a constant (independent) probability v that each \nnewborn in a patch is dispersed in from outside, regardless of the origins of the previous newborn. \nThis assumption also underpins the exponential decay of relatedness RE(\u03c4) and RU(\u03c4) to the focal \norganism with delay (expressions 4.8 and 4.9). It follows that (4.9) will no longer hold exactly, \nmeaning that the expression for the social discount rate (4.13) is no longer valid. \nHowever, random drift in the sex ratio on a patch will be less important as N increases. If the \npossible dependence of changes in the probability per unit time for individual replacement events \non the sex ratio is ignored, then the number of females on a patch of size N will follow an \napproximately binomial distribution of the form B(N, 0.5), so that the standard deviation in the \nproportion of females in a patch becomes smaller as N becomes larger. That is, as N increases \noptimal behaviour will approximate progressively closely to the results for the asexual population. \n \n \n"}
