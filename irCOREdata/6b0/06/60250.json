This was the first application of the SSHAC \u201cLevel 4\u201d methodology (Budnitz \net al 1997) outside the United States, and participating in the study was a new, and a \nstimulating experience for all those engaged in the capacity of experts. The first sub-\nproject of PEGASOS (SP1) concerned the formulation of the seismic source model \nthat would be used for the final hazard calculations. SP2 was charged with \ndeveloping ground motion studies appropriate for use in Switzerland. Site response \nwas handled by SP3, and the actual hazard calculations were conducted by SP4. \nThis division of the project made working with PEGASOS rather different from a \nroutine hazard study, in that each expert was to some extent isolated from the work \nundertaken by the other sub-projects, although the sub-projects were not sealed off \nfrom one another totally. \nSP1 was further divided into four teams of three experts each. Each of these Expert \nGroups was charged with preparing a single model. It was understood at the outset \nthat: \n\u2022 Agreement within each Expert Group was required; \n\u2022 Agreement between the Expert Groups was not required or expected; \n\u2022 Each Expert Group was further expected to take into consideration the range \nof opinions present in the wider scientific community; \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 3\n\u2022 Hence, between the four groups of three, a more or less complete \nperspective of relevant contemporary scientific opinions should inform the \nfinal product. \nThis paper presents a partial account of the modelling process as seen by Expert \nGroup 3 (EG3). The final product of each group was an \u201celicitation summary\u201d; a \ndocument that completely describes, in text and tables, the model as defined by the \ngroup. This paper draws on the elicitation summary produced by EG3; we feel that \nmerely to recapitulate that report (in swissnuclear 2004) would not be appropriate for \nthe wider readership, and consequently this paper concentrates chiefly on certain \nissues that occasioned special discussion with EG3, and which have wider \nimplications for seismic hazard methodology beyond the confines of Switzerland. \n((2)) Inclusion or exclusion? \nThe first point that needs to be considered as a matter of general principle is the \ndegree to which seismic source models should explicitly incorporate competing \nhypotheses. It is generally considered a matter of importance that, in probabilistic \nseismic hazard analysis (PSHA), the full range of uncertainty should be addressed \n(Budnitz et al 1997). This means addressing both issues of epistemic and aleatory \nuncertainty (Abrahamson 2000). Of these, one could say that issues of epistemic \nuncertainty are those things which are unknown but which could conceivably be \nknown (e.g. whether a coin is weighted or fair). Aleatory uncertainty refers to those \nthings that can never be known (e.g. what the next toss of the coin will be). \nMany issues of opinion relevant to the formulation of a seismic source model are \nissues of epistemic uncertainty. Are tectonics in the Alpine foreland thin-skinned or \nthick skinned? Is a given fault active or inactive? What are the depth limits of \nseismicity? What are the magnitude limits? What is the completeness of the \nearthquake catalogue? These are all issues on which different people could express \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 4\ndifferent opinions, and even a single expert might well advance different answers that \ncould equally well be correct on present information. \nA SSHAC Level 4 study is designed to encompass the full range of informed opinion \non all these issues. In the first case, this enhances the scientific robustness of the \nstudy; all available information is incorporated into the model. In the second case, it \nalso enhances the political robustness, in that the study cannot subsequently be \nattacked by Professor X on the grounds that the important hypothesis of Professor X \nwas not taken into consideration. \nHowever, the point remains open as to whether considering a hypothesis necessarily \nmeans including it. The SSHAC Level 4 methodology requires that all relevant \nstudies and ideas be taken into consideration; but it does not preclude the possibility \nthat the EG may consider a hypothesis and then reject it. This issue revolves around \nthe question of weights. Epistemic uncertainty is generally incorporated into the final \nmodel using the principle of the logic tree (Coppersmith and Youngs 1986). \nCompeting hypotheses may be assigned branches in the logic tree, with a weight \nexpressing the EG\u2019s opinion as to the probability that this hypothesis is correct. The \nquestion then comes down to this: given a hypothesis that the EG know of but have \nlittle faith in, should this hypothesis get a branch on the logic tree with a very low \nweight, or should it be given zero weight (i.e. excluded)? \nA specific example can be given, one which generated much discussion in \nPEGASOS as a whole. Could the maximum magnitude in Switzerland be as high as \n8 Ms? One can make a case for this as follows (A): \n(i) The 1812 New Madrid earthquake was over 8 Ms (Johnston et al 1994). \n(ii) What can happen in the Mississippi Valley could equally well happen in \nthe Upper Rhine Graben; \n(iii) Therefore Mmax could be as high as 8. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 5\nOne can equally argue in a contrary fashion (B): \n(i) The 1812 New Madrid earthquake was less than 8 Ms (Hough et al 2000). \n(ii) There are no structures suitable for a magnitude 8 in or near Switzerland, \nnor do the strain rates allow of it; \n(iii) Therefore Mmax could not be as high as 8. \nObviously these are simplified cases. The point at issue is that, from the view of the \nanalyst favouring case B, one could follow two paths. One is to say that case B \nrefutes case A, and therefore no weight should be given to Mmax = 8. The other is to \nsay that although the analyst does not agree with case A, some people in the wider \ncommunity hold case A to be valid, therefore this case must be represented, if only at \nsome very small weight. Therefore Mmax=8 is included in the model weighted at \n0.05 or less. \nThere clearly exists a tendency towards inclusiveness in PSHA practice. A case often \nreferred to, especially by detractors of PSHA, is Bernreuter et al (1989) in which any \nsource model submitted by an expert in the project was considered valid, even \nthough some of the outliers could have been rejected as unrealistic (Musson 2004a, \n2004b). \nIn fact, there is a danger in following this approach. As one considers hazard at \nlonger and longer return periods, extreme outliers begin more and more to dominate \nthe hazard. An early form of deterministic hazard analysis sought to model the \nmaximum possible (worst case) ground motion. The objection to this practice was \nthat the worst case is often so improbable that it is doubtful whether it should be \nconsidered. If one inverts this, and looks to calculate the hazard that is extremely \nimprobable, one should not be surprised if this turns out to be the worst case. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 6\nThus, including in the model a hypothesis in which one has no faith, \u201cbecause it\u2019s \nthere\u201d, at very low weights, can still exert a totally disproportionate effect on the \nhazard, despite the low weights. \nA potential drawback to the SHAC Level 4 procedure is that the analysts preparing \nthe source models are divorced from those doing the hazard calculations, making it \nhard for the former to follow a holistic approach to the modelling, in which decisions \nare made with full knowledge of their impact on the results (though the Level 4 \nprocedure does provide a formal mechanism for allowing this feedback). However, \nthe fact, known in advance, that hazard would be calculated at the very low level of \n10-7 per annum, indicates that one should actually be careful about what is and is not \nallowed into the model, even at very low weights. \nAs a rule, therefore, the EG3 practice was not to spare using zero weights for \nhypotheses which we considered were not sufficiently supportable to include in the \nmodel. Even in some cases where hypotheses were very definitely held by members \nof the wider community, we considered that so long as these ideas were rejected \nfrom our model as part of a thoughtful process, the principle of taking into account \nthe wider body of opinion was satisfied. \n((3)) Spatial smoothing \nThe use of spatial smoothing of seismicity as a means of modelling seismic hazard is \ncurrently a subject of much methodological discussion. The use of grids to smooth \nthe observed earthquake pattern goes back in published studies at least as far as \nJacob et al (1994) and possibly before. It obtained some popularity through the work \nof Frankel et al (1996), and the employment of kernel functions (Woo 1996) is also \nworthy of note. \nAll these methods are an attempt to remove the subjectivity involved in making \ndecisions as to zone geometry, at the expense of abandoning any possible input \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 7\nfrom seismotectonics and geology. (Subjectivity also remains in the choice of \nsmoothing parameters.) The use of smoothed seismicity was aptly described by \nPerkins (1993, pers. comm.) as providing \u201ca good quick first approximation to the \nhazard\u201d. It is certainly a useful tool for computing hazard (especially hazard maps, \nthat will not be used for design purposes) in a hurry in areas where tectonic data are \nabsent or hard to interpret. It can be viewed, for example, as a weapon of last resort. \nThere is also an issue of spatial stationarity. The use of a large seismic source zone \nimplies that future seismicity can be located anywhere within that zone with equal \nprobability. The extreme opposed view would be that historically observed epicentres \nwill repeat themselves exactly in the same places, over and over again. This latter \nview would amount to supposing that seismicity was, in a spatial sense, entirely \nstationary. Spatial smoothing, either of an entire catalogue, or selectively within \nbroadly delimited zones, allows an intermediate position of partial stationarity - that \nearthquakes in future may occur anywhere, but with diminishing probability away \nfrom locations where they have occurred in the past. \nThe use of spatial smoothing is not the only way to achieve the same effect. A model \nused by Musson and Winter (1996, 1997) and discussed in Musson (1997) overlays \na series of broad seismic source zones with a second series of small ones \nconcentrated around past historical epicentres. \nAn issue that was debated in EG3 was whether it is correct to combine zoned and \nzoneless approaches in a logic tree. The argument against this is that a logic tree \nshould confine itself to the expression of epistemic uncertainty (Abrahamson 2000), \nwhereas a zoned approach and a zoneless approach represent a choice of tools, and \nnot uncertainty about the nature of seismicity. To combine the two methods would be \nlike attempting to combine probabilistic and deterministic hazard assessments within \none logic tree. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 8\nThe counter argument is that the primary epistemic uncertainty is in the conceptual \nmodels of seismicity that may be conceived by the analyst. Any procedural approach \nis a way of manifesting a conceptual model, and some models may be more easily \nexpressed by one approach, and others more easily expressed by another. Hence, if \none has two conceptual models of seismicity, one of which is more easily described \nby a set of zones, and the other by a set of smoothing parameters, then it makes \nperfect sense to combine both approaches in the same logic tree. \nHowever, one does not formulate a conceptual model that seismicity follows some \nunknown pattern of zones, and then set out by trial and error to discover what those \nzones might be. Rather, one formulates a conceptual model that seismicity is higher \nin one place and lower in another place for certain reasons, and then uses a zone \ngeometry as a tool to express this model. The concept of zonation has no practical \nmeaning divorced from a real set of zones. Ultimately, a conceptual model does not \nfollow the form of \u201cseismicity is zoned\u201d, but rather \u201cseismicity is zoned in this way\u201d. \nThe same is true of the zoneless approach. One\u2019s conceptual model cannot follow \nthe form of \u201cseismicity is smoothed\u201d (in some unknown way), but should be \n\u201cseismicity is smoothed with these characteristics\u201d. Spatial smoothing becomes a \nuseful tool to express a conceptual model that already contains a smoothing shape \nand wavelength. It cannot be sound practice to decide on a smoothing approach \nwithout any conception of the correct form of the smoothing parameters and then try \nand obtain these by trial and error (and with no means of judging what was error and \nwhat was not). This would no longer be the representation of a conceptual model, but \nrather playing games with a computational method. \nWe therefore asked ourselves whether our ideas about the distribution of hazard in \nthe study area were more faithfully represented by a set of zone geometries that we \ncould express, or a set of smoothing parameters that we could express. We found we \nhad no way of judging the latter, but we could express our ideas in terms of the \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 9\nformer. We therefore chose to reject the use of smoothed seismicity models in our \napproach to describing the seismicity of the study area. It can also be noted, from a \ntechnical perspective, that there is nothing that can be achieved using a spatial \nsmoothing approach that cannot be more or less duplicated, in effect, by thoughtful \napplication of source zones. This gives a further justification in restricting the EG3 \napproach to the use of source zones. \nThis is one example of not including something in the model just \u201cbecause it is there\u201d. \nA second, and in many ways more important case, deals with the issue of active \nfaults. \n((4)) Active faults in an intraplate setting \nConventional practice in PSHA includes explicit fault modelling for active faults, while \nseismicity for which the precise causative fault is not known is usually handled within \nthe zone model. The explicit inclusion of individual faults has two important effects: \n(a) it enables the activity on this fault to be localised along its extent, possibly \nincluding a segmentation model; (b) it enables the effect of rupture dimensions to be \nincluded within the hazard estimation. The word \u201cexplicit\u201d is used judiciously; all \nearthquakes modelled in the PSHA process occur on faults. If a known fault is not \nmodelled in detail, but is encompassed within some source zone, this does not mean \nthat the fault is presumed not to be seismogenic. It means that the fault is not \nconsidered to be more hazardous than other faults within the same zone, which may \nor may not themselves be mapped. Some of the earthquakes that are implied to \noccur within the source zones will, in fact, occur along the known fault in question. \nThe absence of a specific fault source in the model simply implies that earthquakes \nwill not preferentially occur on that fault rather than others in the same zone. It also \nimplies that the rupture dimensions of earthquakes occurring on this fault are not \nsignificant to hazard. (And even this is not necessarily true, as some hazard codes - \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 10\nincluding that used in PEGASOS - treats a source as a set of pseudo-faults with \nknown rupture behaviour.)  \nFor a large source zone, it may well be true that rupture size is not significant to \nhazard. The assumption made in PSHA is that, for any zone, the epicentre of a future \nearthquake may be at any position with equal probability. However, the epicentre is \nin this context a notional point, and one could equally rephrase this as \u201cthe closest \npoint of the rupture plane of a future earthquake projected to the surface may be at \nany position with equal probability\u201d. This is clearly not true for a small zone, the \nmaximum dimension of which is only slightly larger than the projected rupture length \nof a large earthquake within the zone. But it may well be true for a large zone and \nsmall earthquakes. \nThe question now arises as to what constitutes an active fault, and which faults in the \nstudy area (Switzerland and the immediately surrounding areas) are active. \nConventional definitions, largely developed in tectonic areas rather different from \nSwitzerland, refer to any fault that has demonstrably moved in the past x years as \nactive, where x is some large number extending certainly beyond historical times, \nusually back to the beginning of the Quarternary. It is common practice to examine \nknown faults one by one, compare them to this definition, and decide if they are \nactive or not. The number that meets this criterion indicates the number of \u201cactive \nfaults\u201d.  \nWe regard this process as unhelpful in a Central European context. The number of \n\u201cactive faults\u201d can be more directly estimated by approaching the question from the \nother direction. All earthquakes occur on faults; there are approximately 2000 distinct \nepicentres in and around Switzerland; therefore there must be about 2000 active \nfaults in Switzerland. Unfortunately, most cannot be identified or even guessed at. \nThis means that preferential modelling of those faults that can be tentatively be \nconsidered as associated with specific earthquakes can have a very undesirable \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 11\nconsequence: it effectively changes the hazardousness of faults according to \nwhether they have been mapped or not. Consider a case of a zone within which two \nearthquakes of magnitude 5.8 have occurred. One of these is close to a mapped fault \nand consistent with having occurred on that fault; the other one is not. It would be \npossible to identify the mapped fault as \u201cactive\u201d, model the seismicity along it on the \nbasis of one observed event, and apportion the other event to the background of the \nwhole zone. The effect of this is to concentrate hazard along the mapped fault, and \nthe occurrence of the first earthquake has more impact (or at very least, a different \nimpact) on the hazard than the second one. Yet, seismologically, the two events are \nnot different; both occur on faults. The only difference is the state of human \nknowledge concerning the two generating faults: one is mapped, the other is not. It is \nnot satisfactory to have the distribution of hazard so much affected by this rather \nartificial distinction. \nIn the above example, it is assumed that both these faults are roughly similar \nstructures that are old and have been reactivated in the present stress field. In such \ncases, there is no real reason why any neighbouring fault of similar orientation should \nnot be reactivated. The fact that a particular fault has been reactivated once does not \nheavily prejudice one into believing that the next earthquake will occur on the same \nstructure and not some other one.  \nHowever, some faults really are persistently active, such that one can state with \ncertainty that future activity on these faults will occur at the same rate as past activity, \nand the slip rates can also be estimated. This occurs when faults are active because \nthey are controlling recognisable coseismic deformation. An example is the North \nAnatolian Fault - it is inevitable that seismicity will continue on this structure, for \ntectonic reasons that are very well understood. And as a result, it is true that \nseismicity is preferentially disposed to follow this structure because it controls \ndeformation. In which case, it is essential to model it explicitly. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 12\nThe question now becomes whether any such faults can be identified in Switzerland. \nLacking any major active thrust features in the Alps, there appear to be five principal \ncandidates: the Fribourg Fault, the Vuache Fault, the Rheinach Fault, and the two \nmaster faults either side of the Rheingraben. These will be considered in turn (Fig. 1). \n((4.1)) The Fribourg Fault \nAs shown by Deichmann et al (2000), there can be little doubt that the Fribourg \nearthquake of 14 February 1999 occurred along the Fribourg Fault. This structure is \nwell known because it has been studied in detail, and can be contrasted with other \nfaults in the same general area that have not been studied so well, cannot be \ncharacterised so well (if at all), and yet are probably equally dangerous. There is no \ntectonic reason why seismicity should occur preferentially along this fault, although, \nno doubt, it will reactivate again some time in the future. It seems inappropriate, \ntherefore, to single this fault out for special treatment. \n((4.2)) The Vuache Fault \nThis is a similar case to the Fribourg Fault; this fault produced a 5.3 ML earthquake \non 15 July 1996 (Thouvenot et al 1998). It is less significant than the Fribourg Fault \nbecause of its distance from the sites.  \n((4.3)) The Rheinach Fault \nA recent paper by Meghraoui et al (2001) reports trenching across this fault south of \nBasel, with results that are held to show the fault rupture of the 1356 Basel \nearthquake as well as possible earlier events. If this evidence were correct, it could \nindicate a persistently active fault producing the largest regional events. However, \nnormal faulting along this feature is an implausible hypothesis to explain the 1356 \nearthquake, as shown by Meyer et al (1994). A more probable explanation for the \ndisplacement seen on the Rheinach Fault is slumping, which could be earthquake-\nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 13\ntriggered or not. In our view the probability that the Rheinach Fault is significantly \nseismogenic is sufficiently small that according it special treatment is not required, \nand might be harmful to the model for reasons already given. \n((4.4)) The Rheingraben Boundary Faults \nThe Rheingraben is a major rift running roughly N-S, bounded by controlling faults on \neither side. If the graben were still subsiding, these boundary faults would be \nexcellent examples of exactly the sort of fault for which special treatment as seismic \nsources would be required - faults the persistence of which can be assured because \nof their role in controlling contemporary deformation. Evidence suggests, however, \nthat extension in the Upper Rheingraben ceased in Oligocene times. The significance \nof the bounding faults under the current tectonic regime is debatable. We concluded \nthat these faults are not critical in controlling current seismicity. \nWe were not able to identify any other candidate fault structures that required \nconsideration, and could not conclude that any of the faults discussed above merited \nspecial treatment within the seismic source model as persistent, preferentially active \nsources. We therefore decided not to include any individual faults in our seismic \nsource model. Because explicit fault modelling has a tendency to increase hazard \nsharply close to the fault (see, for example, Marin et al 2004) we considered it \nundesirable to include explicit fault modelling just \u201cbecause it was there\u201d, even with \nlow weighting. It would have required much higher confidence on our part that any of \nthese structures were actively controlling deformation in the present tectonic regime. \n((5)) Source zoning \nUp to now, it might seem that this paper has been somewhat negative in character, \ndealing more with what was left out than what was included. These issues have been \nemphasised largely because they are issues of general application in intraplate \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 14\nPSHA studies, whereas the fine details of the model that was produced are of less \ngeneral interest to those working outside Switzerland. We now turn to the decisions \nthat were taken on what was included in the model, at least in outline. \nOur opinion was that the optimum way to construct a robust seismic source model \nfollows three key stages. \nThe first stage involves the determination of the kinematic model. This is the basic \nelement of the conceptual model of the seismic process at a sub-continental scale. \nThe kinematic model describes, at the broadest scale, what is the relationship \nbetween large blocks in the Earth\u2019s crust in terms of relative movement. In a very \nsimple case this might be stated as: Block A is subducting northwards under Block B, \nwith resulting large thrust earthquakes at the interface and lesser amounts of \nintraplate seismicity within the two blocks in reaction to the stresses engendered by \ndifferential subduction. This describes the basic mechanisms for earthquakes that \nare to be expected in different parts of the area under examination. \nThe second stage refines the kinematic model into the seismotectonic framework. In \nthis part of the process, the very broad divisions used in the kinematic model are \nlooked at in more detail, with the aim of dividing them up into volumes of crust that \nare sufficiently structurally distinct that it is improbable that seismicity could be \nconsidered to be uniform across the boundaries of such divisions. At this stage, the \nkey elements to be assessed do not include seismicity except in a rather broad \nsense. Rather, one is seeking to characterise areas that have a similar style of \nfaulting, are experiencing a similar pattern of crustal stresses, and so on. In drawing \nup the seismotectonic framework one may start drawing basic crustal divisions that \nwill ultimately form the outline of the seismic source model itself. \nThe third stage is the final construction of the seismic source definition. Here the final \npartition of the seismic source model is made from analysis of the seismotectonic \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 15\nframework together with the detailed pattern of observed seismicity and local \ngeological structure. \nBy following this sequence of steps, we believe that an informed basis can be found \nfor decision making about the detail of the model. How those decisions were taken in \nthis study will now be described. \n((5.1)) The Kinematic Model \nIn looking at the kinematics of crustal deformation in the area of study, a few key \nquestions immediately arise. Firstly, what is the relationship between Alpine tectonics \nand seismicity? Can we see active seismicity along Alpine thrust structures indicating \nthat mountain building is still in progress? Secondly, and clearly related, is the nature \nof the boundary between the Adriatic Plate and the European Plate. Thirdly, there are \na number of contentious questions about the tectonics of the Alpine Foreland. We will \ntake these topics in turn. \n((5.1.1)) Alpine Tectonics \nAlthough one might superficially expect the Alps to be similar to the Himalayas with \nrespect to tectonics and seismicity, this is clearly not the case. With the Himalayas, \nthe major active thrust planes (such as the Main Boundary Fault and Main Central \nThrust) are easy to identify, and their activity is incontrovertible (Chandra 1978, Singh \net al 1990) even if the details are still subject to discussion. \nThe same is evidently not true in the Alps. There are no great earthquakes, and there \nis no apparent correlation between seismicity and major structural features. The rate \nof convergence and seismicity in the Himalayas is an order of magnitude greater \nthan in the Alps. \nWhile the Alps are still a young mountain range, it is clear, that the active orogenesis \nsuch as is seen in the Himalayas cannot be used as a model for the Alpine region. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 16\n((5.1.2)) The Adriatic-European Plate Boundary \nNevertheless, it is clear that the southern Alps mark a plate boundary between the \nAdriatic Plate and the European (Eurasian) Plate. The Adriatic Plate has been \nconsidered either to be part of the African Plate or an entity of its own; either way, it \nis not part of the European Plate and its interaction with that plate is clearly \nsignificant. \nIt has generally been accepted that the European Plate is subducting or has \nsubducted under the Adriatic Plate, though the situation is far from clear. The \n\u201clithospheric root\u201d discussed in Mueller (1997) can be interpreted as a broken-off \nslab, now almost vertical, though this seems to be controversial.  \nThe role of the Adriatic Plate as a rigid indenter is significant and will be returned to \nfrequently in the course of this report. On the one hand, the fact of continental-\ncontinental collision taking place (albeit at a relatively low rate) can be viewed as a \ndriving force in terms of seismicity. Secondly, the nature of the collision, and the \nrotational movement involved (Meletti et al 2000), can be seen to be strongly \ninfluencing the local stress field. The change in direction of maximum compressive \nstress from the Western Alps to the Eastern Alps is well documented, and has been \ninterpreted since the work of Pavoni (1961, 1975) as due to this cause. The precise \nstress pattern in the Alpine region is suggested to be an interaction between the \nprevailing continental stress direction and the radial pattern resulting from the \nrotational collision of Adria and Europe (Kastrup et al 2002). \nSince the seismicity of Switzerland appears not to be interpretable in terms of active \ntectonic deformation along new features, the consensus of opinion is that the \ndominant cause of seismicity is the reactivation of old features in a typical intraplate \nmanner. In this case, the radial stress pattern is rather important, as the distribution \nof seismicity is likely to be related to the interaction of stress direction and the \navailability of suitably oriented structures for reactivation. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 17\n((5.1.3))  Alpine Foreland Tectonics \nThe recent tectonic history of the Alpine Foreland area, including the Molasse basins \nand the Jura, has long been a subject of controversy amongst geologists. The debate \nhas been summed up recently by Sommaruga (1997). The basic dichotomy is \nbetween the schools of \u201cthin-skinned\u201d and \u201cthick-skinned\u201d tectonics. The former \nmodel states that northward movement has taken place of a crustal detachment over \nthe whole Alpine Foreland area without involvement of the underlying basement. The \nthick-skinned model holds that major thrust structures in the Foreland region \npenetrate through the overlying detachment, and that the basement has also been \naffected by northward displacement. \nThe weight of contemporary geological opinion, we believe, generally favours the \nthin-skinned school. However, it is also clear from the earthquake catalogue that \nseismicity is far from being concentrated within the upper crustal detachment; nor is \nthere any concentration of seismicity at the detachment-basement interface. In fact, \nseismicity appears to be more significantly concentrated within the basement.  \nThe implication is that, whatever the dominant mode of deformation has been in the \nAlpine Foreland region in geologically recent times, currently, seismicity in the \nbasement is more important. From this, it would appear that most geological data \nabout the structure of the detachment is hardly relevant to the analysis of the \nseismicity. Most geological studies are principally concerned with the topmost 4 km \nof crust, where the seismicity is generally low. The structure of the basement \nbetween 5-15 km is not much known, yet this is where the majority of seismic energy \nis being released, even allowing for poor constraints on depth in the earthquake \ncatalogue. \nAnd yet, allowing for the fact that more seismicity seems to occur in this depth band \nthan any other, the geographical pattern of seismicity in the basement and the \ndetachment do not seem to be greatly different, apart from a pronounced absence of \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 18\neven small seismicity in a central part of the Molasse Basin in Switzerland at shallow \ndepth (<5 km). It seems paradoxical that, if there is no involvement of the basement \nin the shortening processes that occur in the detachment, there should nevertheless \nseem to be patterns of seismicity that persist in both, and perhaps even have some \ncorrelation with formations (such as the Jura) that exist only in the detachment. One \nsenses that the domination of the thin-skinned school of explanations may not be \nwholly justified. \n((5.2)) Seismotectonic Framework \nHaving established the broadest outline of the model, we now proceed to look for \nsubdivisions within this, where we can discern reasons for supposing that the \nseismicity within certain volumes of crust is similar, and different from neighbouring \nvolumes of crust. A number of different data sets were considered as potentially \ngiving information on which decisions could be based. \nObviously, the earthquake catalogue is a data set of primary importance, and to \nsome extent the usefulness of other data sets is proportional to the extent to which \nthey shed light on variations in seismicity. The depth distribution of seismicity is an \nimportant feature that is a function of the earthquake catalogue; particularly in the \npresent case where major differences in depth distribution can be discerned from one \narea to another.  \nMaps of seismicity are useful both in showing the broader variations in seismicity that \nhelp to form the seismotectonic framework, and also in shaping the precise \nboundaries of individual zones later. \nOther data sets considered included topography, geological units (considered in \nthree dimensions), faulting, fault plane solutions, stress inversion, depth to Moho, \ndepth to Mesozoic, subsidence\/uplift measurements, in situ stress measurements, \npalaeoseismic data, gravity data, magnetic anomaly data, heat flow, thermal spring \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 19\ndistribution, and others, including derived parameters such as regional variations in \nmagnitude-frequency b value, derived from the earthquake catalogue. \nNot all of these were found to be useful. In many cases it was considered advisable \nto inspect a class of data in case it seemed to shed light on the distribution of \nseismicity (which often it didn\u2019t), rather than because we expected it a priori to make \na significant contribution. \nThe role of faults as individual sources has already been discussed; but even when \napproaching the modelling process entirely with a zoned approach, the use of fault \ndata is important. In particular, one is interested in distinguishing areas where the \nfaulting has similar characteristics. One would not normally group an area with a \nstrong N-S trend of faulting with an adjacent area where the faulting was principally \non a NW-SE trend; because it is unlikely that seismicity would be similar in both \nareas. In the model, observed faulting patterns (either mapped or from fault plane \nsolutions) were used to determine expected orientation of future earthquake ruptures. \nObserved faults were not used directly to restrict estimates of expected maximum \nrupture dimensions; these were derived from estimates of maximum magnitude. \nHowever, decisions on maximum magnitude were informed by the absence of \nsuitable structures to host exceptionally large earthquakes. \nThe practice of deriving stress inversions from groups of fault plane solutions \novercomes any problems rising from vagaries within fault populations. Some \nexcellent studies by Eva et al (1997), Eva and Solarino (1998) and Kastrup (2002) \nshow that conducting inversions for homogeneous earthquake populations can \nindicate the characteristic faulting type(s) and local stress field. Attempting the same \nthing with heterogeneous sets of earthquakes gives conspicuously poor results. The \nvery application of this method, therefore, serves to delineate areas where the \nseismicity is generally consistent, and then arrives at descriptions of that consistent \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 20\ncharacter. We therefore accorded this data a high priority in establishing the \nseismotectonic framework. \nEven a simple inspection of focal mechanisms in Switzerland shows differences in \ndeformational style by area. The study by Kastrup (2002) found that acceptable \nstress inversions could be obtained by making about eight local groupings of events. \nThe resulting analysis showed a range of stress regimes. \nIn the first place, it is clear that the direction of the maximum compressive stress \nshows a radial pattern, going from WNW-ESE around Geneva to NNW-SSE in the \nZurich area. This confirms the pattern already discussed. This pattern, which follows \nthe curve of the Alps, is only observed close to the mountain chain. As one moves \naway to the north, it gradually fades into the general European stress field arising \nfrom North Atlantic ridge push (Kastrup 2002) \nIn the second place, the predominant styles of faulting also change, from normal \nfaulting in the Penninic Alps to strike-slip in the Rheingraben, with areas of strike-slip \nto thrust (e.g. Graubunden) contrasting with strike-slip to normal regimes (e.g. \nZurich). \nThe existence of normal faulting is interesting in that it indicates that in the high Alps \nespecially, deformation is no longer governed by compression (as one might expect \nin a collision-driven mountain belt) but extension is going on. \nFrom Kastrup\u2019s (2002) study it also appears that lines marking major crustal \nboundaries are also significant in dividing different faulting regimes: in particular, the \nHelvetic Front and Peninnic Thrust appear to have this role. To these we would add \nthe Insubric Line, which appears to play a similar role in Eva et al (1997). \nThe significance of the Helvetic Front as a divider between areas of quite different \nseismogenic properties is underlined by the dramatic contrast in seismicity depth \nprofiles to south and north of it, as shown by Deichmann et al (2000). This boundary \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 21\nclearly separates volumes of crust with very different earthquake populations, and \ntherefore cannot be ignored in the formulation of a seismic model. \nIt is rather striking, when considering the radial Alpine stress pattern, to note that \nprecisely where the direction of maximum stress is perpendicular to the Helvetic \nFront (and also the important Hercynian trend) and parallel to the dip direction of the \nMoho, seismicity is conspicuously low both north and south of the Helvetic Front. \nEither side of this NW-SE band of low seismicity are bands of rather higher \nseismicity, again trending NW-SE, and beyond these, seismicity decreases again. \nThis may be a reflection of interaction between the direction of maximum \ncompressive stress (which is radial) and the distribution of faults of given orientation \n(which probably isn\u2019t). Whatever the explanation, the fact is that we do see a \nseismotectonic pattern in Switzerland that forms the basis of a seismic source \npartition, and, in simple terms, this consists of a series of dividing lines following the \ncurve of the Alps, marking major crustal divisions, and a second series of dividing \nlines perpendicular to the first, following the direction of maximum compressive \nstress. The resulting pattern contrasts most strongly in seismicity rate as one moves \nfrom west to east, and contrasts most strongly in depth distribution (and possibly also \nb value) when moving from north to south. \nAny seismic source model reflects the purpose for which it was constructed, and in \nthis case the model was designed specifically for calculating hazard at four sites in \nSwitzerland. The margins of the study area are relatively unimportant from the point \nof view of hazard and we felt it appropriate to treat them in less detail. For Northern \nItaly south of the Alps, our only concern was to construct the model so that the right \nnumber of earthquakes appear at roughly the right distance. Most of the territory of \nFrance that appears within the study area has been treated only in a very broad way. \nThe northern part of the study area is treated, so far as the seismotectonic framework \nis concerned, as three areas: a stable area in the east, a stable area in the west, and \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 22\nthe Rheingraben separating them. The latter is a major structural weakness and is \nclearly the locus for most of the seismicity in that part of the study area north of the \nAlpine Foreland. The evolution of it is discussed comprehensively by Schumacher \n(2002), illustrating the shifting of the principal depocentres in geological time. The \ncurrent regime is characterised as predominantly left-lateral strike-slip faulting with \nthe central graben acting as a restraining bend. Young pull-apart basins are \npresumed to be forming in both the northern and southern graben segments. The \ndetailed treatment of this in the zone model is discussed in the next section. \nIt is particularly noteworthy that there appears to be a rather higher level of seismic \nactivity where the southern end of the Upper Rheingraben meets the Alpine \nForeland. This area includes the largest earthquake in the study area (the 1356 \nBasel earthquake).   \n((5.3)) Source zonation \nThe zonation itself is based on a generalised kinematic schema, in which Italy is \nseen as a rigid indenter creating a radial stress pattern in the Alpine region. This \ncreates a pattern of rings and sectors. The \u201crings\u201d are progressively further from the \nItalian collision zone and are separated by major structural divisions (Penninic \nThrust, Helvetic Front). The \u201csectors\u201d are due to the rotation in the local stress \nregime, which interacts with the general structural grain (SW-NE) to produce a \npattern of alternate zones of high and low seismicity.  \nThe basic seismic source model consists of area source zones defined by simple \npolygons.  Seismicity is assumed to be spatially homogeneous within these sources, \nwith the exception of the distributed Basel source described below. The bulk of the \nmodel consists of a single set of unvarying polygonal source zones, defined in the \nconventional PSHA manner, the boundaries of which are firm divisions between \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 23\ndifferent sets of seismicity parameters (i.e. most of the zone boundaries are not \u201csoft\u201d \nin the sense of allowing seismicity to percolate from one zone to adjoining territory).  \nIn some source models, \u201csoft\u201d boundaries are used to indicate uncertainties in the \nlocation of the edges of source zones; particularly in cases where the model involves \nactive sources surrounded by a matrix that is either discounted as aseismic or is \nmodelled as a low-activity background area. Historically, this approach was first used \nto eliminate sharp \u201ccliffs\u201d from hazard maps (Bender and Perkins 1987), and its carry-\nover into site studies has not always found support (to judge from some informal \nconversations in the wider hazard community). \nIn this model, the source zones constitute a complete tessellation of the area under \nconsideration, and we consider such an approach of less relevance, as it has the \ngeneral effect of scattering earthquakes in both directions across any source zone \nboundary. To some extent many of the source boundaries have uncertainty \ninasmuch as we could postulate numerous minor variations in geometry; indeed, \nmany such refinements were made in the course of the development of the model. \nSuch variations would better express the uncertainty in the boundary positions than \nan ad hoc application of soft boundary methods; however, our consideration was that \nincorporating such uncertainties would add hugely to the complexity of the model \nwith very little actual benefit in terms of results. \nThe basic model is shown in Figure 2. \n5.4 Zone models and logic trees \nThe last point leads on another general issue, the use of alternative source zone \nmodels in the logic trees used in PSHA to represent uncertainty and imperfect \nknowledge. Exactly how multiple source models should be prepared is not something \nmuch discussed in the literature (in fact, as has often been commented, there is not \nmuch guidance in the literature in preparing source zone models at all). \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 24\nIt is clear from experience that if one gives the same data to two hazard analysts, two \ndifferent source models will result. There is nothing necessarily wrong with this; it \nmeans that more than one different interpretation of the data is possible. It was \ninteresting to see, in the course of this project, the different models prepared by the \ndifferent Expert Groups from the same data. Points of similarity but also contrast can \nbe found in all. We would regard the EG3 model as the most \u201cclassical\u201d in style, \nconsisting as it does of relatively simple polygons. One can debate as a matter of \npractice how abstracted source zones should be. At the one extreme, using a very \nfew, highly geometrical zones, risks oversimplifying the seismicity to such an extent \nthat the result is completely unrealistic. At the other extreme, elaborate zone \nboundaries based on the surface expression of geological units may have no real \ncorrespondence to seismogenic processes in the lower crust. \nOne can think of five bases for including variant model geometries in a source model. \nThe first would be the attempt to include totally different interpretations; as if, say, \nEG3 were to try to guess how EG1 were thinking, and produce a completely different \nset of source zones on different principles. This is difficult, and certainly redundant in \nPEGASOS where in any case, four different models will be combined from the four \nEGs. \nThe second would be to try and include all the minor variations possible within one \ninterpretation. For example, in the development of the EG3 model, the exact \nconfiguration of the zones around the Jura were redrawn several times. One could \nregard each redrawing as a variant with its own validity, but by and large, we \nconsidered the successive variants to be improvements rather than alternatives. \nThe third case is where specific questions arose which could not be settled in \ndiscussion. For example, is the Rhine Graben a single homogeneous seismogenic \nunit or is it not? If this is a question without a clear answer, it can be handled by \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 25\ndevising variant models where in one variant the Rhine Graben is unified and the \nother it is divided. \nThe fourth case is where the use of multiple models is used to obtain an effect that \ncan be achieved by overlaying different geometries. For example, overlaying a set of \nbroadly defined zones and a second set of smaller zones is a way of partially \nsmoothing the seismicity within a region with recognised centres of activity (Musson \n1997). \nFifth is a set of circumstances where different model geometries are applied to \ndifferent subsets of the seismicity. The obvious example is where seismicity varies \nwith depth, and one set of zones models shallow seismicity, with one or more \nancillary sets of zones beneath. In this case the zone geometries merely overlap; \nthey are not weighted alternatives. Another example would be the use of one set of \nzones for moderate magnitude seismicity and another one for larger earthquakes, if \none believed that the spatial distribution of larger events was distinct. According to \nWoo (1996) zone models are necessarily independent of magnitude; this is not the \ncase at all. \nIn the EG3 model for PEGASOS, we used variants for the model geometry only for \nthe third reason. There were three instances, the first of which was the Rhine Graben \npartitioning already mentioned. The second involved the curious concentration of \nseismicity in the Swabian Jura, which has seen intense seismicity since 1910 but \nwith no previous historical precedent. There is no good geological reason for this \nlocalisation of activity (it coincides with the Hohenzollern Graben, but is entirely \nbeneath this rather shallow feature). One could posit either (a) there is some \nunknown seismogenic feature at the location of the 1910 earthquake that periodically \nbecomes active in the same place, or (b) such a concentration of seismicity is not \ntied to one geological feature and could recur at almost any place in the broader \nSwabian area. This leads to two model variants, one where the Swabian Jura \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 26\nseismicity is represented by a small separate zone, and one where the 1910 and \npost-1910 seismic sequence is merged into the surrounding zone. The last case \ninvolved the Permo-Carboniferous grabens on the Swiss-German border which \narguably are a significant seismic source, and arguably are not, leading to two variant \nzone configurations. These alternatives are all shown in Figure 2. They combine to \ngive eight possible configurations in all. \n((6)) Assessing model parameters \nWe now discuss some issues relating to assessing the parameters defining the \nseismicity in each zone. The conceptual framework we adopted was one intended to \ncombine a series of approaches ranging from the essentially general, in which \ndivisions between the zones are minimised, and the particular, in which the seismicity \nparameters in each zone are heavily dependent on data local to that zone. \nThis developed into a system where the logic tree was based around three main \nbranches, most easily categorised according to the procedure used for assessing \nmaximum magnitude (Mmax). The logic tree we used combines methods for \nestimating Mmax with methods for assessing seismicity rates; each branch contains \none Mmax technique and one seismicity rate\/b value technique.  \nThe first approach is to assess Mmax in a very general way. One can show a number \nof cases worldwide (especially in an intraplate environment) where approaches to \nestimating magnitude Mmax have failed (or would have failed), because recent \nearthquakes have occurred with magnitude larger than what might have been \npreviously assumed using geological or seismological indicators. To choose an \nexample at random, a study by Al-Tarazi (1999) estimated a single maximum \nmagnitude value for the Gulf of Aqaba of 5.7 ML, based on statistical analysis of an \nearthquake catalogue closing in 1993. In 1995 an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms \noccurred in this locality. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 27\nWe therefore created a branch in the logic tree with a branch for a set of \u201cglobal\u201d \nvalues for Mmax being 6.5, 7.0 or 7.5 Mw, these values applying to all zones equally. \nSo in this global branch it is believed that Mmax is most likely 7.0 Mw anywhere in \nthe region, without taking into account the local features, and with a smaller \nprobability even as high as 7.5 Mw. The presence of this branch in the logic tree is \nintended to cover the pessimistic possibility of an anomalously large event on some \nunknown feature that might strike anywhere. \nIt will be noted that one part of this branch supposes that nowhere in the study area \nwill any earthquake exceed 6.5 Mw, which may seem strange when the ECOS \n(2002) catalogue includes an earthquake larger than this. We are taking into \nconsideration the fact that the magnitude values of medieval earthquakes are \ninherently uncertain, and that the largest historical Swiss earthquake may perhaps \nnot have been larger than 6.5 Mw whatever the \u201cbest-estimate\u201d value in the \ncatalogue is. \nThis approach to Mmax was combined with a penalised maximum likelihood \napproach to seismicity parameters. For all zones in all parts of the model we used a \ntruncated linear Gutenberg-Richter model, with truncation applied as a sharp cut-off. \nExamination of seismicity data did not suggest that there was evidence for seismicity \nin any zone not to follow this model. Since this first branch of the model was intended \nto treat the hypothesis that seismicity across the whole of Switzerland is essentially \nsimilar, in this branch, although seismicity parameters were determined for each \nzone individually, they were all determined using the same prior, which was derived \nfrom the entire catalogue. In some PSHA studies it is the practice to use the same b \nvalue derived from the total catalogue for every zone and vary only the activity rate; \nthis we regard as too great a level of abstraction and liable to lead to unrealistic \ncases. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 28\nThe two other branches of the logic tree presented source-specific approaches to \nmaximum possible magnitude; Mmax was estimated in each source zone \nindividually. Some general limits are set for both branches. For each zone, Mmax \nwas never considered to be less than 5.5 Mw or the largest historical earthquake in \nthe zone (rounded up to the nearest half-magnitude), whichever was the larger. Also \nMmax was never allowed to be more than 7\u00bc Mw (it is regrettable to write this as \n7.25; the decimal system has disadvantages when the inherent inaccuracy of data \nmakes working in quarter-units necessary). This limit was based on a combination of \na slight increase on the largest observed historical event in the whole catalogue, \ngeneral judgement on maximum observed earthquakes in corresponding areas, and \na lack of significant structures that would be reasonable to expect very large \nearthquakes to occur on. The slight increase on this limit in the first branch is \nspecifically designed to provide an extra margin of conservatism in the overall model. \nWithin these limits, in the second branch of the logic tree Mmax was calculated using \na simple maximum likelihood approach with no prior, taking into account the historical \ncompleteness values for the zone. Other studies that have used a maximum \nlikelihood approach (e.g. Wahlstr\u00f6m and Gr\u00fcnthal 2001) have usually restricted the \nresults by using a prior derived from observations from similar crustal types. We \npreferred not to follow these examples, but to rely entirely on the local data and \naccept the degree of uncertainty in the results that this decision entails. The \nimposition of an upper bound keeps the distribution of results within desired limits \nand preserves the desired shape. \nIn this second branch, seismicity parameters were again estimated by the maximum \nlikelihood method, but, in contrast to the first branch where a single global prior was \nused, in this case local priors were used for each zone, emphasising the differences \nrather than the similarities. These local priors were derived from least-squares \nsolutions to the magnitude-frequency data for each zone. \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 29\nThe final branch provides a joint determination of Mmax, activity rate and b value. \nThis method is explained in detail in Musson (2004c), and will not be gone into in \ngreat detail here. The method relies on selecting possible seismicity parameters for a \nzone at random and attempting to generate synthetic earthquake catalogues (subject \nto the same historical completeness constraints) that match the real earthquake \ncatalogue within an acceptable tolerance level. Values that give successful matches \nare noted, and the logic tree is ultimately compiled from this distribution. \nConsidering only Mmax, a simplified illustration can be given. Suppose that activity \nrate and b value are known. Choose a value for Mmax at random, generate a \nsynthetic catalogue subject to historical constraints, and check whether an \nearthquake occurred larger than the maximum historical observed earthquake. If the \nhistorical maximum was not exceeded, note the Mmax value. Proceed until 5,000 \nsuccesses have been recorded. The distribution of Mmax values for the logic tree is \nconstructed from the distribution of 5,000 successful values. \nConceptually, this method for Mmax is similar to the maximum likelihood approach \nwith a flat prior (the same as no prior). It has the advantage that it estimates all the \nseismicity parameters at the same time. Both our zone-specific approaches to \nmaximum magnitude attempt to answer the same question, \u201cGiven the historical \ncatalogue and the constraints upon it, what is the likelihood that events that are x \nmagnitude units larger than the observed magnitude are possible, yet never \nhappened in historical times?\u201d One approach seeks to address this analytically, the \nother approach experimentally. \nIn terms of activity rate and b value, the attraction of this method is that it is entirely \ndriven by the data within each zone and requires no assumptions or subjectivities. \nThe output determines even the number of logic tree branches to be used, as well as \ntheir values and weights. Also, there is no danger that the values derived are not \nentirely consistent with the historical data.  \nThe PEGASOS Expert Group 3 hazard model Musson et al. \n 30\nThe output of the joint inversion is a series of branches that relate to triplet \ncombinations of Mmax, activity rate and b value. One could use these directly, but in \npractice, although b value and Mmax are correlated, the correlation is weak, and it is \nadequate to separate out the weights for the different Mmax values in order to reduce \nthe total number of logic tree branches.  \nThe basic structure of this part of the logic tree is shown (with weights) in Figure 3. \n((7)) Conclusions \nThis paper has presented some aspects of the EG3 seismic source model for \nPEGASOS. Partly for reasons of space, many issues and details are not given here, \nbut also because most of the details, while critical for calculating the hazard results in \nthis project, are not so interesting to the general reader. We have instead \nconcentrated more on the philosophical aspects of the way in which the model was \nconstructed over a three year process.  These broader issues are relevant to a wide \nrange of PSHA situations, and whether or not the reader agrees with the decisions \nthat were adopted by us in this study, as seismic hazard is still a relatively young \ndiscipline, we consider that exposing methodological issues to discussion in the \ngeneral literature is helpful to the development of practice. \n((8)) Acknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their thanks to the PEGASOS TFI team for their \nsupport in preparing the model, especially to Kevin Coppersmith and Bob Youngs. \nWe would also like Jim Farrington for all the hard work he put into the day-to-day \nmanagement of the project, and also to his colleagues in Proseis, Zurich.
