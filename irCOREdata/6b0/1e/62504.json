In \naddition, zonal variability within the tropics, such as long periods of El Ni\u00f1o Southern \nOscillation (ENSO)-like conditions [1, 2] can have extra tropical influence through \nperturbation of the global hydrological cycle [3].  The regional expression of these processes \nis complex, and our understanding is partial, since few sites preserve detailed records \nbeginning before the last glacial maximum (LGM).  Southern hemisphere localities are \nespecially poorly represented in this climate mosaic, yet they are crucial to test phase \nrelationships with polar regions as proposed by bipolar seesaw models [4, 5].  Here, these \nteleconnections are examined through a 25 ka diatom-based oxygen isotope record \n(\u03b418Odiatom) from the northern basin of Lake Malawi (10-15\u00b0S, 34.5\u00b0E), providing the first long \ncontinuous record of its kind from continental Africa. The \u03b418Odiatom record is complemented \nby a lower resolution deuterium record from palmitic acid (\u03b4Dpa)  and extends previous \nmultiproxy palaeolimnological findings from the lake\u2019s northern basin [6-9] \n \n1.1. Modern climate, hydrology and limnology \nLake Malawi\u2019s climate is largely controlled by the north-south migration of the inter-\ntropical convergence zone (ITCZ) that marks the meeting of the north-easterly monsoon and \nthe south-easterly trade winds (Figure 1). A north westerly airflow can also bring rain of \nAtlantic origin to Malawi via the Congo basin [10, 11].  A single rainy season occurs during \nOctober-March when the ITCZ lies over the lake, and a dry season (April-September) is \ncharacterised by strong south-easterly trade winds. Mean rainfall over the catchment is 1350 \nmm yr-1, but there is a steep north-south rainfall gradient due in part to the orographic \ninfluence of the northern Rungwe mountains. At the inter-annual scale, the Malawi catchment \nstraddles the boundary between the southern subtropical and the equatorial climatic regions, \nwhich often respond to El Ni\u00f1o events by negative and positive annual rainfall anomalies, \nrespectively [12]. In general, Malawi receives greater or normal rainfall under La Ni\u00f1a \nconditions when the sea-land temperature gradient increases and convergence occurs over \nthe continent, whereas in El Ni\u00f1o years the ascending limb of the Walker circulation moves \neastward to the western Indian Ocean [13].  Patterns of sea surface temperatures in the \nsurrounding oceans are also important controls on the Rossby wave across southern Africa, \nbringing greater amounts of rain when the east Atlantic and Agulhas region are warm and the \nwest Indian Ocean is relatively cool [11].  It has been demonstrated that under present \nboundary conditions higher rainfall south of 15\u00b0S occurs when Greenland is relatively cold \nand vice versa [14]. Correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and rainfall over the \nregion helps define this process and implies that the ITCZ shifts southward when the NAO \ndriven westerlies are strongest [10].   \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n \nThe climatology described above identifies ultimate source areas for Malawi rainfall \nas the western Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic.  The importance of each source is not \nknown and will change according to zonal circulation patterns such as ENSO and relative \nsea surface temperatures (SSTs) [12].  Atlantic waters will become more isotopically \nenriched through recycling of transpired water from the Congo Basin as has been suggested \nfrom elsewhere in East Africa [15, 16].  The oxygen isotope composition of rainfall in the \nLake Malawi catchment interpolated from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation \n(GNIP) stations is \u20136 to \u20139\u2030, with a marked \u2018amount effect\u2019 (higher rainfall intensity giving \nlower \u03b418O and \u03b4D) during the wet season [17].  Deuterium values are similarly interpolated \nto be \u201314 to \u201338\u2030. Direct precipitation and river discharge each represent ~50% of the water \ninput to the lake, while evaporation and outflow contribute ~84% and ~16% of output, \nrespectively [18, 19] resulting in a net evaporative loss. Rivers north of 10.5\u00b0S discharge \nabout 53% of total runoff. Water isotope values from the northern catchment are similar to \nrainfall estimates (\u20133.1\u2030 < \u03b418O < \u20135.4\u2030  and \u201314\u2030 <\u03b4D <\u201331\u2030) [20].  In contrast to these \nlow rainfall and runoff values, we found the lake had high isotope values (+1.8 <\u03b418O < \n+2.3\u2030) measured at three stations from the southern basins to a depth of 50 m with only \nlimited variation between measurements (Table 1).  These values are comparable with \ndeeper profiles from the central basin made in 1976 at the end of the wet season [21] and \nothers from the northern basin at the end of the dry season in 1993 [20].  Our water isotope \nmeasurements were also made at the end of the dry season and represent maximum \nepilimnion values.  Strongly enriched isotope values from the lake water, relative to those of \nthe major inputs, testify to the fractionation exerted by evaporation from the lake surface.  \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n \nDiatoms dominate the phytoplankton during the dry season when strong lake water \nmixing (April-September) [22], low humidity and SE winds reinforce radiative cooling of \nsurface water. All diatom silica is subject to some degree of dissolution during sinking and \nearly diagenesis, but a rather high proportion (7 to 11%) of diatom production is permanently \nburied in Malawi [19].   Aulacoseira nyassensis (Figure 2) is the most ubiquitous diatom in \ncores from the northern basin and comprises the majority of the diatom biomass measured \nfor \u03b418Odiatom.  In addition to the diatom-based oxygen isotopes, we measured compound \nspecific hydrogen isotope ratios as an alternative and complementary (to \u03b418Odiatom) insight \ninto water isotope fractionation and palaeohydrology.  It is important to note that the \ndeuterium data are to be interpreted as a pilot study and full calibration of these data in \ntropical regions requires extensive further study. \n \n2. Materials and methods \nThis study is based on core M98-2P core (9\u00ba 58.6' S, 34\u00ba 13.8' E, 363 m depth) from \nthe northern basin of the lake collected by International Decade of East African lakes \n(IDEAL) programme members [6-9].   Eight AMS radiocarbon analyses (Table 2) have been \nmade on either total organic matter from M98-2P (seven dates) or charcoal (one date).  The \ndates were found to be conformable to six previous dates on a nearby core (M98-1P) when \ncorrelated using ash marker horizons [23].  Core M98-2P contains sections of laminated \nsediments interspersed with homogeneous lake mud and five cm-scale ash horizons (Figure \n3). Detailed stratigraphical data is provided in earlier publications [6-9]  \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n \nCore M98-2P was sampled at approximately 10 cm intervals for diatom-based oxygen \nisotope analysis, giving a mean resolution of 200 years.  Diatoms were extracted using hot \nH2O2 and HNO3, then sieved at 63, 38 and 20 \u03bcm and further concentrated using split cell \nthin flow (SPLITT) separation where necessary [24].  For most samples the 63-38 \u03bcm or 38-\n20 \u03bcm fraction contained the majority of the diatom biomass.  Our methodology successfully \nseparated the diatoms from clays and volcanic ash.  However, the cleaning process also \nremoved small diatom taxa including most periphytic species and resulted in near \nmonospecific samples dominated by Aulacoseira nyassensis (Figure 2).  Although this \nskewed the diatom assemblage it also eliminated any possible inter-specific variability in the \nacquisition of oxygen [24].  A stepwise fluorination method was used to strip hydrous \ncomponents from the diatom silica before a full reaction with BrF5 [24].  The oxygen liberated \nwas then converted to CO2 and normalised against NBS standards.  Sample reproducibility \nwas approximately 0.3\u2030. \n \nSediment samples for \u03b4Dpa were freeze-dried, and free lipids extracted using an \nAccelerated Solvent Extractor ASE200 using 2:1 (v\/v) dichloromethane (DCM):methanol.  \nCarboxylic acid fraction is isolated from the total extracts using solid phase extraction \n(Aminopropyl Bond Elute\u00ae), and was then methylated using anhydrous 2% HCl in Methanol. \nMethylated carboxylic acid fractions were further purified using a silica gel flash column \nchromatography with DCM as the eluant (removes hydroxyl-carboxylic acids).  Hydrogen \nisotope analyses were performed using a gas chromatography \u2013 high temperature \nconversion \u2013 isotope-ratio mass spectrometer [25]. Compounds separated by GC column \nwere converted to H2 by a pyrolysis reactor at 1445\u00b0C.  Six pulses of hydrogen reference gas \nwith known \u03b4D values were injected via the interface to the IRMS, for the computation of \u03b4D \nvalues of sample compounds. Typical standard deviation of triplicate analyses is <  \u00b1 2\u2030. \nInternal standard heneicosane also showed consistent \u03b4D values throughout the analyses, \nwith variability < \u00b1 2\u2030.  The isotopic difference before and after derivatisation was used to \ncalculate the \u03b4D value for the hydrogen from the added methyl group [25].   \u03b4D values \nobtained from individual acids (as methyl esters) were corrected by mathematically removing \nthe isotopic contributions from added groups before reporting. \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n \nStatistical treatment of the \u03b418Odiatom data used Analyseries v.1.2 [26]. Singular spectrum \nanalysis (SSA) was applied to enhance the signal\/noise ratio and to highlight the periodicities \nevident in the raw diatom record (embedding dimension: 20; Vautard-Ghil autocovariance \nestimation) [27]. Data were re-sampled every 200 yr, normalised by their standard deviation \nand detrended for their long-term linear trend before performing the SSA. Periodograms of \nthe raw data and SSA filtered data were performed using the Blackman-Tukey method \n(analysis of 50% of the series; Bartlett window). \n \n3. Results and interpretation \nThe Malawi diatom-based oxygen isotope values span a range of 18\u2030 (Figure 3).  A part of \nthis range is accounted for by lake water temperature as values of \u03b418Odiatom are governed by \nboth temperature and the isotope composition of lake water (a function of source water, \nprecipitation and evaporation) at the time the diatom frustules formed. Temperature has been \nestimated independently from these cores using the TEX86 index (the average number of \ncyclopentane rings incorporated into membrane lipids of Crenarchaeota) [28], and suggest \nsurface temperatures compared to modern values (25-29 \u00b0C) of \u20133.5\u00b0C during the LGM, \u2013\n1\u00b0C during the YD and around 8.2 ka BP, and values of +3\u00b0C and +5\u00b0C were calculated for \nca. 13.8 ka and 5 ka BP (Figure 3).   Temperature changes of this order and published \n\u03b418Odiatom  fractionation factors of \u20130.2 to \u20130.5 \u2030 per \u00b0C [29, 30] do not alter significantly the \n\u03b418Odiatom  curve.  Instead, the variation in \u03b418Odiatom must derive mainly from changes in the \nLake Malawi water isotope composition (\u03b418Olake), itself a function of precipitation (amount \nand source), temperature, and evaporation.  A sensitivity analysis of lake waters to changes \nin climate parameters  [31] has showed that a 1\u2030 depletion in \u03b418Olake would need either a \n3.7 \u00b0C decrease in temperature, a 6.7 mS-1 increase in windiness, a 17% decrease in \nhumidity, or a 1.4\u2030 depletion in \u03b418O of inputs.  Since evaporation enriches the lake by 8\u2030 \nrelative to precipitation at the present day, large changes in water isotope values in the past \nwill have resulted from shifts in precipitation \u2013 evaporation (P-E).  Understanding of the \nacquisition of \u03b418Odiatom  values by diatoms has increased significantly but no study of a large \nlake has yet been able to make a fully quantitative reconstruction of lake water isotope \nhydrology analogous to that achievable from calcite [24].  A major source of uncertainty is the \nearly diagenetic alteration of frustules post mortem [32] that can cause an offset between \nlake water isotope conditions and that recorded by sedimentary diatoms.  There is very little \nevidence of dissolution in these sediments although maturation processes causing infilling of \npore spaces within the frustule cannot be discounted.  In the absence of a detailed modern \nsampling programme, relating seasonal \u03b418Odiatom  values from plankton tows to sediment trap \nand surface sediments, that is beyond the scope of this present study, our interpretation is \nlimited to relative changes in \u03b418Odiatom. \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n \nSupport for the predominance of water balance considerations in the interpretation of \n\u03b418Odiatom comes from a correlation between diatom biovolume, a surrogate for diatom \nproductivity and \u03b418Odiatom.  Singular spectrum analysis [27] reveals the underlying variability \nin these curves and a positive linear correlation between the two filtered time-series (r2 = \n0.63) for the last 15 ka.  Diatom productivity is greatest during the dry season today and \nduring decadal-scale low lake level stages within the past 200 years (Gasse, unpublished \ndata).   Before 15 ka the relationship decouples, as other factors such as external loadings of \nSi and P, nutrients essential to diatom productivity, would have become limiting under \ngenerally dry glacial conditions [19, 23]. \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n \nGood agreement is found between the \u03b418Odiatom and \u03b4Dpa values (Figure 3).   This is \nexpected since lake water provides the source of both the diatom oxygen and the deuterium \nwithin palmitic acid (an aliphatic carboxylic acid that reacts with glycerol to form lipids in a \nbroad range of organisms) providing that the lipids extracted from the sediments are of \naquatic origin.  The source of the organic material is important since higher plants can be \nenriched in \u03b4D by 10-60\u2030 relative to aquatic tissues due to direct use of meteoric waters and \nphysiological factors [33].   A correlation with lake water isotope values and measured \u03b4D \nfrom palmitic acid contained in lake sediments across North America has been established \n[25], but in a large complex lake such as Malawi, this assumption requires further testing . \nThe organic matter in these deepwater Lake Malawi sediments is largely of algal origin as \ndemonstrated by C\/N, \u03b413C, \u03b415N and HI values, although the relative contribution of \nterrestrial and aquatic sources is variable [8].  \n \nOur interpretation of the two diatom and palmitic acid isotope curves is therefore broadly \nsimilar, yet some differences can be anticipated according to the processes of isotope \nacquisition, the provenance of the palmitic acid and seasonal differences between the istope \nhosts.  Seasonality in lake water isotope values is important since diatom productivity is \nskewed toward the cooler, windier dry season.  Like the bulk organic matter, the aquatic \nlipids contain a significant algal component derived from a weighted sum of all three major \ngroups; namely Cyanobacteria, Chlorophytes and diatoms, found in the lake in varying ratios \nduring the annual cycle [34].  Whereas the diatoms will incorporate a dry season isotope \nsignature, if the palmitic acid was largely from other algae, a greater proportion of the \ndeuterium would be incorporated during the strongly stratified wet season.  Inter-annual \nvariation between algal groups and the amount of biomass they produce will have occurred \nthroughout this 25 ka series, leading to differences in the season represented by the \ndeuterium isotopes.  The oxygen and deuterium isotope curves are likely to diverge most \nstrongly when diatom productivity is low relative to that of the lake as a whole, as probably \noccurred during the LGM when Si limited diatom production [7], or if high runoff brought more \nabundant higher plant material to the deep waters.   \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n \n3.1. The pre-Holocene period   \n \nA general pattern of increasing \u03b418Odiatom values, punctuated by a series of wet-dry \nfluctuations, can be observed from the core base to ca. 15 ka, when following a major wet \nperiod, oxygen isotope values oscillate at centennial to millennial scales around the mean of \nthe record.  Given the range of indicators which suggest evidence for relative aridity at the \nLGM and a lower lake level [6-8, 35], it is perhaps surprising that both of the isotope curves \ndo not contain values that are more enriched in the heavier isotope.  One explanation of \nrelative high values of \u03b4Dpa is that the majority of autochthonous production at this time \nderived from Cyanobacteria and Chlorophytes using nutrients delivered during a shortened \nwet season or from upwelling.  Low diatom biovolume and biogenic silica flux [7] indicates \nonly weak diatom growth occurred around the LGM, probably due to silica becoming rapidly \nlimited if catchment inputs of silica were reduced under a drier climate (Figure 3), and a \nswitch toward other algal groups would have been likely.   \n \nSpecific wet-dry periods in the \u03b418Odiatom  record can be correlated with proxies from \nneighbouring sites, including the relatively wet interval 17-18 ka that can be found in lake \nTanganyika to the north and in the Makapansgat stalagmite oxygen isotope record from \nSouth Africa [36].   More generally, the millennial scale variability in the \u03b418Odiatom record \ncorresponds to temperature changes at high latitudes, although broadly opposing \nrelationships are observed with Greenland (GISP2; [37]) and during the postglacial period \nwith Antarctica (eg. Dronning Maud Land [38]) (Figure 4).  According to these data, \ncentennial-scale dry periods in Malawi occur when Greenland is relatively cold [39], and vice \nversa.  For example, dry events ca. 21.5-22 ka and 19-20 ka coincide with cool periods in the \nGISP2 temperature reconstruction.  Moreover, the most extensive dry period in our record \nfrom 17.8-14.5 ka corresponds to the cool interval preceding the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d (BA) in \nGreenland and the major postglacial warming of Antarctica.  The highest \u03b418Odiatom value \n(+39.7\u2030), representing the most intense dry period in this sequence is recorded at 12.5 ka, \nthe start of the exceptionally cold Younger Dryas in Greenland.  Conditions at lake Malawi \nduring the Younger Dryas are complex and show a second maximum dry phase at 11.8 ka \nbefore the establishment of wet early Holocene conditions.  Relatively high concentrations of \nperiphytic diatoms, a diminished silica flux to the lake and organic matter composition \nsupport the interpretation that these were relatively dry periods [6, 23, 40]. Other data from \nthis core show low P, suggesting reduced river inputs, and variable volcanic ash inputs \nbrought either by northerly wind or rivers to the lake from the northern catchment during \nmany of the dry intervals described here [7]. The organic matter record shows high primary \nproductivity from 17.9-16.5 ka and has been interpreted as indicative of high nutrient flux \nfrom increased runoff [40].  But, diatom productivity was low at this time, suggesting that at \nleast the supply of Si did not increase, and instead it could be envisaged that stronger \nvertical mixing led to more efficient regeneration of N in the epilimnion, thereby shifting lake \nwater stoichiometry and altering competitive interactions amongst phytoplankton in favour of \nCyanobacteria.   \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n \nAround 13.5 ka there is a remarkable decrease in \u03b418Odiatom coeval with a minimum in diatom \nperiphyton [6].  This negative oxygen isotope spike has been replicated and corresponds to a \nsimilar excursion in the \u03b4Dpa data and corresponds to a peak in water temperature inferred \nfrom TEX86 [28].  These independent measurements indicate that these unusual values had \na physical underpinning and cannot be dismissed as experimental error.  The \ncorrespondence with \u03b4Dpa suggests that isotopic dilution was brought about by an increase in \nrainfall over the catchment, and the lake reaching its overflow after several millennia of \nclosure may have amplified the response.  This remarkable wet phase in the Malawi basin \noccurred during the Antarctic Cold reversal [41] and the second half of the warm BA period in \nGreenland.  It falls within the major post-glacial expansion of more northerly lakes that began \nca. 15 ka in Tanganyika [42], Victoria [43], Rukwa [44, 45], Manyara [46], Magadi [47] and \nothers [35], although these proxy (mainly diatom) records show a protracted wet period until \nat least the Younger Dryas. \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n \n3.2 The Holocene \nThe early and middle Holocene reveals a series of wet-dry fluctuations around the mean \nvalues for the sequence and is relatively stable compared to earlier and succeeding periods \n(Figure 3 and 4).  The record suggests relatively high P-E at ca. 11.0, 9, 7.5 ka and \nmaximum aridity at 10, 8.2, and 6.4 ka. Relatively dry conditions at 8.2ka are well known \nfrom several high resolution sites in East Africa [48].  Around 7 ka we observe some minor \ndifferences between the shape of the \u03b4Dpa and that of the \u03b418Odiatom curve.  Seasonal \ndifferences in the acquisition of water isotopes could again have occurred as proposed for \nearlier parts of the record, although contamination with higher plant material would offer a \nsimpler explanation to high \u03b4Dpa, especially as inputs of terrestrial remains from the lake \nmargin are suggested by the organic matter composition [8].  The period ends with a wet \npulse at 5.3 ka confirmed by a sharp peak in \u03b4Dpa and coeval with the warmest lake water \ntemperatures [28].  After 5 ka, the frequency of changes increases, but the underlying trend \nindicates relative aridity around 4 ka followed by a return to values around the mean of the \nseries.  \n \n4.

Relationships with Antarctica are less clear since the stadial-\ninterstadial pattern is weaker during the deglaciation, although some suggestion of an \nopposing or lagged response to ice core temperatures [49] can be observed, in accordance \nwith the bipolar seesaw hypothesis [4].  Positive fluctuations of the large northern ice sheets \nand to a lesser extent Antarctic sea ice, increased meridional temperature gradients, sucked \nheat from the tropics, intensified trade wind circulation and cooled surrounding oceans to \nvarying degrees.  The cooling of tropics at the LGM would have reduced humidity levels and \nrainfall in regions where convergence is important. Moreover, GCMs suggest that the greater \nrelative cooling of the northern hemisphere pushed the austral summer Hadley cell to the \nsouth [50].  The product of these processes was that much of tropical Africa was relatively \ncool and dry at the LGM, even in the southern hemisphere, despite positive insolation forcing \nsouth of the equator [7, 28, 35].  It is likely that glacial forcing was extremely important \nthroughout the deglaciation, with shifts in the interhemispheric asymmetry altering rainfall \npatterns.   \n \nCooler SSTs have been estimated for the oceans surrounding southern Africa at the LGM \nand GCMs using these values generate drier conditions over the region [51].  Estimates \nsuggest temperatures in the south-eastern Atlantic fell by up to 3.5\u00b0C [52], whereas those of \nthe south west Indian Ocean were diminished by only 1.4-2.6\u00b0C [53].  Under present \nboundary conditions this zonal pattern of SSTs arises during El Ni\u00f1o years and creates drier \nconditions in southern Africa, and less convergence across southern Africa as the main \nconvective zone shifts to the western Indian Ocean.  SSTs in the Indian Ocean are a critical \ncontrol on moisture fluxes to the continent [54] and are likely to contribute to the post LGM \ncentennial scale wet\/dry intervals revealed by \u03b418Odiatom.  ENSO forcing would be supported \nby apparent links across the Indian Ocean to N. Queensland.  Here a peat humification \nrecord from Lynch\u2019s Crater [55] thought to result from ENSO processes, reveals a millennial \nscale structure similar to that of our \u03b418Odiatom record (Figure 4).  For the most part the two \nrecords are in-phase, with an exception around 17 ka that may arise from chronological \nuncertainties.   \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n \nThe structure of our record is comparable to evidence of abrupt events from sites in \nequatorial East Africa [56] and processes such as ENSO that presently initiates a rainfall \ndipole between equatorial and southern Africa must have been largely subservient to \nmeridional mechanisms especially glacial forcing.  For example, modelling of a freshwater \ndischarge to the North Atlantic of a magnitude similar to that occurring during the Younger \nDryas cool event, produced slightly warmer surface temperatures in the equatorial Atlantic \nand over the African continent [57].  Under this simulation the ITCZ shifted southward and \nnorth-easterly trade winds were strengthened.  Monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean would \nalso become more northerly, such that reduced convergence occurs and summer rainfall \nwould be diminished [57]. In addition, stronger winds from the south during the austral winter \nwould augment evaporation from Lake Malawi as demonstrated by periods of reduced P-E, \nmarked by high \u03b418Odiatom and enhance upwelling and diatom productivity in the northern \nbasin.  An alternative ENSO-based explanation of the Younger Dryas has been proposed \nthat involves the Pacific into a La Ni\u00f1a pattern due to orbital configurations [58].  Using the \npresent as a reference, this scenario would tend to favour wetter conditions in southern \nAfrica, which would be at odds with our data. \n \nThese isotope data show strong connections with global climate variability, and it is \ninteresting to observe that quasi-periodicities in the \u03b418Odiatom time series are analogous to \nperiods found in other climate proxies.  A dominant periodicity of 2.3 ka years, broadly \ndescribes the spacing of the dry events in this sequence (Figure 5a).  This is exemplified by \nthe first two principle components (PC1+2) generated by the SSA that account for almost \n41% of the explained variance (Figure 5b).  We also observe periods at 4.5 ka and less \nstrongly at 1.6 ka in both the raw and filtered \u03b418Odiatom data. The former is best represented \nby PC3 (14% of the variance) and the 1.6 ka cycle is mapped by PC 4+5 that cumulatively \nexplain 14% variance (Figure 5c and 5d).  Similar periods are found in Antarctica at 4.4 ka \nand 2.4 ka in Vostok temperatures [59], and in Greenland (GISP2) where a 2.3 ka cycle \noccurs in the K+ data, and is thought to represent meridional atmospheric circulation [60].  \nCombination tones and harmonics of orbital cycles have been proposed as mechanisms \nbehind these frequencies [59], as has solar activity [61].  There is less evidence in the time \nseries analysis of direct modulation by thermohaline circulation since, although the relatively \nweak 1.6 ka cycle is broadly equivalent to North Atlantic rhythms [62] given chronological \nconstraints (N. Atlantic is rather 1.47 ka).   \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n \nFurther quantification of the isotope hydrology \u2013 climate relationships from these important \nsites requires extensive calibration of the processes leading to the acquisition and retention \nof the isotope signal in these new host materials.  Nevertheless, the Lake Malawi \u03b418Odiatom \nrecord confirms the presence of centennial-millennial scale dry periods in the southern \ntropics of East Africa since the LGM.  We find expressions of the deglaciation driven by re-\norganisation of SSTs and atmospheric circulation, at a period known from studies of solar \nvariability [61].  Furthermore, abrupt events, well known from the equatorial and northern \ntropics [56] [63] can be observed in this southern hemisphere lake.  These isotope data \nsuggest an important role for the tropics in at least amplifying, if not even instigating changes \ntransmitted through Earth\u2019s primary atmospheric circulation systems. \u2013  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe wish to thank our partners in the IDEAL project, and especially the co-ordinators Prof \nT.C.
