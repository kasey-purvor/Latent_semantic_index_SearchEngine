Most simulations are presently done with hydrostatic models.4\nThe hydrostatic assumption simplifies the numerical computations considerably, and has facilitated5\nnumerous interesting studies of oceanic flow. However, as the horizontal resolution of the ocean mod-6\nels is gradually refined with increasing computer power, the validity of the hydrostatic assumption7\nmay, depending both on the problems addressed and the grid sizes used, become questionable. Non-8\nhydrostatic ocean models are therefore used in many recent studies, see for instance Marshall et al.9\n(1997b,a); Cummins et al. (2003); Legg and Adcroft (2003); Kanarska and Maderich (2003); Berntsen10\nand Furnes (2005); Berntsen et al. (2006); Hodges et al. (2006); Kanarska et al. (2007); Lamb (2007);11\nXing and Davies (2007).12\nSince non-hydrostatic models are more complicated and time consuming to use, it will be important13\nto establish some guidelines for when it is necessary to include the non-hydrostatic pressure effects.14\nScale analysis may be used to determine such criteria. In Marshall et al. (1997b) the non-hydrostatic15\nparameter n = \u03b32\/Ri is suggested. In this expression Ri is the Richardson number, \u03b3 is the aspect16\nratio h\/L, and h and L are characteristic vertical and horizontal length scales, respectively. If n \u226a17\n1, the motion is hydrostatic. If the stratification is weak, and processes on small horizontal length18\nscales are important, this criterion may not be satisfied, and the use of non-hydrostatic models should19\nbe considered. However, to model the non-hydrostatic processes, the grid size must also be chosen20\nsmall enough to facilitate a good representation of the phenomena that are influenced by the non-21\nhydrostatic pressure effects. Therefore, when considering to apply a non-hydrostatic model, both the22\nrelevant parameters and length scales of the problem and the grid sizes one may afford to apply should23\nbe taken into account.24\n4One may also consider to compute non-hydrostatic screening parameters to locate areas where non-1\nhydrostatic pressure effects may be important. The non-hydrostatic screening parameter may be used2\nto decide during run-time where and when the non-hydrostatic pressure and corresponding velocity3\ncorrections should be computed. Preliminary results based on this approach are presented in Wadzuk4\nand Hodges (2004).5\nA third approach will be to consider more specifically important physical processes where non-hydrostatic6\npressures are expected to be significant. Focusing on such processes one may run a numerical model7\nboth with and without non-hydrostatic pressure effects for a range of grid sizes, thus allowing processes8\non gradually smaller scales to play a role as the grid size is reduced. Using this approach, we may9\nobtain better qualitative and quantitative information about the non-hydrostatic pressure effects than10\nwhat may be obtained through for instance scale analysis. This approach is used in the present study,11\nand the focus is on tidally driven flow over a sill in a stratified fjord or loch. Fjords may be regarded12\nas laboratories to investigate baroclinic processes, and in particular processes near sills where energy is13\ntransferred by non-linear effects from large to small scales and eventually mixing, see for instance Stige-14\nbrandt (1976); Stigebrandt and Aure (1989); Stigebrandt (1999); Farmer and Freeland (1983); Farmer15\nand Armi (1999); Cummins et al. (2003); Stacey and Gratton (2001); Klymak and Gregg (2001, 2003,16\n2004); Inall et al. (2004, 2005); Vlasenko et al. (2002).17\nThe tidally driven processes near Knight Inlet, British Columbia, have in particular been well investi-18\ngated using both measurements (Farmer and Armi (1999); Armi and Farmer (2002); Klymak and Gregg19\n(2001, 2003, 2004)), and numerical model experiments (Stacey (1985); Cummins (2000); Afanasyev20\nand Peltier (2001a); Klymak and Gregg (2003); Cummins et al. (2003); Lamb (2004). Hydrostatic,21\nnon-hydrostatic, rigid-lid, and free surface models are used, and the studies are performed with both22\nslip and no-slip bottom boundary conditions. A wide range of grid sizes, horizontally and vertically, and23\nsubgrid scale closure schemes is applied in these studies. The sensitivity of the flow to the stratification24\nis also investigated. To facilitate high resolution numerical studies, two-dimensional (2D) versions of25\n5the numerical models are typically used with grid sizes in the range from approximately 1 to 200m.1\nImportant three-dimensional (3D) effects (Klymak and Gregg (2001, 2004)) that also may play an2\nimportant role in the creation of the downstream wedge discussed in several recent papers (Afanasyev3\nand Peltier (2001a); Farmer and Armi (2001); Afanasyev and Peltier (2001b)), are neglected in the4\n2D studies. To facilitate 3D studies, coarser grids than those used in the 2D studies may have to be5\nused. In the process of setting up the 3D model, appropriate grid sizes and turbulence closures have to6\nbe chosen, and the decision on whether to include non-hydrostatic pressure has to be made. Possible7\nconsequences of too coarse grid sizes and of neglecting the non-hydrostatic pressure effects should be8\nconsidered.9\nTidally driven processes have also recently been investigated in Loch Etive, see Inall et al. (2004, 2005).10\nMotivated by the Loch Etive measurements Xing and Davies (2006a,b), hereafter XD06a and XD06b,11\nand Davies and Xing (2007) applied idealised cross sectional models of Loch Etive to get further insight12\ninto how barotropic tidal energy is converted into internal waves and mixing. The sill depth at Loch13\nEtive is approximately 15m, whereas the corresponding depth at Knight Inlet is approximately 60m.14\nThe processes and energy transfers near the sill are affected by the sill depth, and Loch Etive may15\ntherefore be regarded as a suitable study area for fjords or lochs with sills that are shallower than16\nthe sill in Knight Inlet. The supercritical stratified tidal flow in Loch Etive is also recently analysed17\nin Stashchuk et al. (2007) using a non-hydrostatic model. The importance of non-hydrostatic pressure18\neffects for this system is demonstrated in Xing and Davies (2007).19\nFor tidally forced flow over sills the transfer of energy from the scale of the incoming tide towards the20\nscales associated with internal waves, horizontal small scale eddies, overturning rolls, and eventually21\nirreversible mixing may be very strong, see for instance Inall et al. (2004); Klymak and Gregg (2004).22\nThe long range of spatial and temporal scales involved and the strong non-linearities make numerical23\nmodelling of these systems very challenging. With present computer resources it is not feasible to resolve24\n6all relevant scales and one must keep in mind that the numerical results will be sensitive both to the1\ngrid size and to the choice of subgrid scale closure.2\nIn the numerical experiments reported in Xing and Davies (2007), the vertical grid size was 1m and3\nthe horizontal grid size varied gradually from 10m in the sill region to 100m outside this area. These4\nmodel simulations were performed with with the MITgcm, see Marshall et al. (1997b,a); Adcroft et al.5\n(1999). In Berntsen et al. (2008) the sensitivity of the numerical results for the idealised Loch Etive to6\nthe grid resolution was investigated using equidistant grid sizes ranging from 100m to 12.5m. These7\nstudies were performed with a cross sectional non-hydrostatic \u03c3-coordinate model, see Berntsen et al.8\n(2006). Detailed observations of tidally driven flow near sills reveal small scale process (Farmer and9\nArmi (1999)), and we may expect strong non-hydrostatic pressure gradients associated with internal10\nwaves and instabilities in such systems. One may therefore ask whether the grid sizes used in Xing11\nand Davies (2007) were sufficient to capture the full strength of the non-hydrostatic pressure effects.12\nIn Stashchuk et al. (2007) for instance the horizontal grid size used was 2.5m.13\nThe choice of problem for investigation of non-hydrostatic effects may also be based on analysis of14\nthe rate of change of the vertical velocity DwDt where w is the vertical velocity and\nD\nDt the material15\nderivative. For strong flow over a sill that is short and steep, like the one in Loch Etive, one may expect16\nlarge values of DwDt near the sill and therefore strong non-hydrostatic effects. However, in a numerical17\nmodel, the computed values of w may be regarded as average values of vertical velocity over the grid18\ncells. The computed values of w and DwDt will therefore tend to decrease in magnitude with coarser grid19\nsizes. For the same reason one may expect that the differences between the results from hydrostatic20\nand non-hydrostatic numerical studies of flow over a sill are reduced if the grid size is increased.21\nThe strength of the non-hydrostatic effects depends on DwDt , which in a numerical model is forced via22\nthe gradients of the non-hydrostatic pressure by the local divergence or convergence in the model cells.23\nThe divergence\/convergence is in each model cell computed from provisional \u2019hydrostatic\u2019 velocities,24\nsee Kanarska and Maderich (2003); Berntsen and Furnes (2005); Kanarska et al. (2007). Both DwDt and25\n7the divergence\/convergence are strongly affected by the viscosity and diffusivity. To explore some of1\nthis sensitivity, the numerical experiments to be described are performed with two sets of values for2\nviscosity and diffusivity.3\nIn the present study we follow up previous studies of flow over a sill. The model domain is focused4\nmore around the sill and thereby studies with equidistant horizontal grid sizes in the range from 100m5\ndown to 1.5625m are facilitated. The sensitivity of the non-hydrostatic pressure effects to the grid size6\nis investigated, and possible non-hydrostatic effects on the time mean flow are also studied. The model7\napplied is a non-hydrostatic cross sectional \u03c3-coordinate model, see Berntsen et al. (2006).8\nThe numerical ocean modelling community is moving towards higher resolution, non-hydrostatic mod-9\nels, and the viscosities and diffusivities are often reduced with the grid size. The primary objective of10\nthis study is to examine in a region of significant non-hydrostatic effects, the sensitivity of the computed11\nsolutions to the grid size and to the non-hydrostatic pressure effects. Although previous studies of flow12\nin sill regions have been performed, systematic convergence studies as suggested here have to the au-13\nthors knowledge not been undertaken. The insight gained will be particularly important as calculations14\nmove to 3D where computational limitations will restrict the grid size to relatively coarse grids.15\nIn Section 2 the numerical experiments are described. A detailed discussion of the results is given in16\nSection 3. A summary and a general discussion are given in Section 4.17\n82 The numerical experiments1\nThe \u03c3-coordinate ocean model applied in the present studies is a two dimensional, (x, z), version of the2\nmodel described in Berntsen (2000) where x and z are the horizontal and vertical Cartesian coordinates3\nrespectively. The model is available from www.math.uib.no\/BOM\/. The variables are discretized on a4\nC-grid. In the vertical, the standard \u03c3-transformation, \u03c3 = z\u2212\u03b7H+\u03b7 , where \u03b7 is the surface elevation, and5\nH the bottom depth, is applied. For advection of momentum and density a Total Variance Diminishing6\n(TVD)-scheme with a superbee limiter described in Yang and Przekwas (1992) is applied in the present7\nstudies. The standard second order Princeton Ocean Model (POM) method is applied to estimate the8\ninternal pressure gradients (Blumberg and Mellor (1987); Mellor (1996)). The model is mode split with9\na method similar to the splitting described in Berntsen et al. (1981) and Kowalik and Murty (1993).10\nIn the 2D model, all variations in the cross channel direction, y, are neglected, and all \u2202\/\u2202y terms in11\nthe governing equations are accordingly set to zero. There will still be cross channel velocities due to12\nthe Coriolis effect since the Coriolis frequency f is equal to 1.2\u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121, a value typical of northern13\nlatitude regions.14\nIn the model, the total pressure P is split into three components P = P\u03b7 + Pint + PNH where P\u03b7 is the15\npressure due to the free surface elevation, Pint is the internal pressure, and PNH is the non-hydrostatic16\npressure. Using a splitting technique, the non-hydrostatic pressure PNH may be computed by inserting17\nthe expressions for the non-hydrostatic velocity corrections into the equation of continuity (Kanarska18\nand Maderich (2003); Heggelund et al. (2004)). Due to the \u03c3-transformation, additional terms appear19\nin the pressure equations, which complicates the computations. An alternative method, that has been20\nadopted in the present study, is to view the non-hydrostatic pressure directly as PNH(x, \u03c3, t), where21\nt is time, or a pressure due to convergence or divergence in the \u03c3-coordinate system (Berntsen and22\nFurnes, 2005).23\n9The time steps are performed with a predictor-corrector method where the leapfrog method is used as1\nthe predictor and the fully implicit method is used as the corrector.2\nThe model has recently been applied to study lock release gravity currents and the propagation of3\nsolitary waves up an incline (Berntsen et al. (2006)) and the results are related to measurements4\nfrom laboratory experiments and to corresponding results from the MITgcm (Marshall et al., 1997b,a;5\nAdcroft et al., 1999). The results produced with the BOM are generally consistent with corresponding6\nresults from the MITgcm. However, by using a \u03c3-coordinate model a better representation of the7\nprocesses in the bottom boundary layer may be achieved. In Berntsen et al. (2006) more details about8\nthe estimation of the non-hydrostatic pressure are given. For convergence studies of the BOM see9\nAvlesen et al. (2001); Berntsen et al. (2006).10\nThe set up of the numerical experiments is similar to that described in XD06a and Berntsen et al.11\n(2008). The topography and the initial temperature field, \u0398, are given in Fig. 1.12\nA simple linear equation of state is used to convert temperature to density, see Xing and Davies (2001).13\nThe initial buoyancy frequency N is 0.01 s\u22121 in all experiments. For unforced systems and constant14\nN , the propagation of internal waves may be studied with linear models, see Cushman-Roisin (1994);15\nKundu and Cohen (2008). However, in the present study with strong tidal forcing of the flow over a16\nshallow sill, see below, there will be a strong nonlinear transfer of energy from long to short scales as17\ndemonstrated and explained in XD06b also with constant buoyancy frequency.18\nThe depth profile H(x) in meters is specified according to19\nH(x) =\n8><\n>>:\n\u221250 + 351+(x\/500)\u2217\u22174 , x < 0\n\u2212100 + 851+(x\/500)\u2217\u22174 , x > 0\n(1)\nassuming x = 0m at the top of the sill. The model domain extends from x = -1000m to x = 2000m20\nand both lateral boundaries are open. For sensitivity of the results to the slope steepness see XD06b.21\n10\nThere is no flow through the sea bed. Initially the water elevation is zero, and there is no flow.1\nTidal flow is forced into the model domain through the left open boundary. At this left boundary a2\n10 grid cell wide flow relaxation zone (Martinsen and Engedahl (1987)) is added to the computational3\ndomain. The depth is constant and equal to the depth at x = -1000m in this zone. In the left boundary4\nzone all components of the velocity field, the water elevation, and the temperature field are updated in5\neach time step according to6\n\u03c6 = (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c6int + \u03b1\u03c6ext, (2)\nwhere \u03c6int contains the unrelaxed values computed by the model and \u03c6ext is a specified external value.7\nThe relaxation parameter \u03b1 varies smoothly from 0 at x = -1000m to 1 in the leftmost boundary cell,8\nsee Martinsen and Engedahl (1987).9\nThe M2 tide is forced into the domain by specifying an external velocity in the x-direction uext\u2212left(t)10\nas11\nuext\u2212left(t) = u0 sin(\u03c9M2t) , \u2200 z , (3)\nwhere \u03c9M2 = 0.000140526 rad s\n\u22121 and u0 = 0.3m s\n\u22121 in all experiments. The tidal forcing and the12\nidealized topography is appropriate for Loch Etive and based on recent measurements in the region13\n(Inall et al. (2004)). The purpose of the present studies is not to reach steady state, but to investigate14\nthe non-hydrostatic effects for various horizontal grid sizes. The non-hydrostatic effects vary throughout15\na tidal cycle, but they are similar at corresponding times in consecutive tidal cycles. The focus in this16\nstudy is on the non-hydrostatic effects during the period leading up to maximum flow over the sill, and17\nthe experiments reported here are run for 1\/4T where T is the M2 tidal period. This means that there18\n11\nis inflow through the left open boundary zone and outflow through the right open boundary zone in the1\nwhole simulation period. At the left open boundary the external values of the velocity components in2\nthe y and z directions are zero, and the external values of the temperature are kept equal to the initial3\ntemperature profile. The external values for the water elevation \u03b7ext\u2212left(t) are computed as lateral4\naverages of the water elevations \u03b7 close to the left boundary zone5\n\u03b7ext\u2212left(t) =\n1\n10\u2206x\nZ\n\u22121000m+10\u2206x\n\u22121000m\n\u03b7(x, t)dx . (4)\nAt the outflow right boundary, 20 grid cells with constant depth equal to the depth at x = 2000m are6\nadded to the computational domain. The first 10 cells are used as an averaging zone, and the rightmost7\n10 cells are used as a flow relaxation zone. In the averaging zone the external values for the velocity in8\nthe x-direction uext\u2212right are computed as lateral averages of the model velocities in the x-direction u9\naccording to10\nuext\u2212right(z, t) =\n1\n10\u2206x\nZ 2000m+10\u2206x\n2000m\nu(x, z, t)dx . (5)\nIn the right flow relaxation zone equation (2) is used to update the model velocities. In this zone the11\nrelaxation parameter \u03b1 varies smoothly from 0 at x = 2000m + 10\u2206x to 1 in the rightmost boundary12\ncell. The use of equation (2) and this choice of uext\u2212right allows the average interior velocity profile13\nto propagate smoothly through the open boundary. This averaging technique was first suggested in14\nBerntsen et al. (2002) and is also used to compute external values of the velocity components in y and15\nz directions, the water elevation, and the temperature field.16\nIn the vertical 100 equidistant \u03c3-layers are used in all experiments. Horizontally the grids applied17\nare equidistant and the experiments are run with horizontal grid sizes \u2206x equal to 100m, 50m, 25m,18\n12.5m, 6.25m, 3.125m, and 1.5625m in order to investigate how the non-hydrostatic effects are affected19\n12\nby the grid size. In the experiments with \u2206x = 12.5m the internal time step used is 0.56 s, and 301\nexternal time steps are used for each internal step. The time steps are scaled proportionally with2\n\u2206x in the experiments with other grid resolutions in order to keep the Courant numbers equal in all3\nexperiments. One numerical experiment over 1\/4T with \u2206x = 1.5625m takes approximately 200 hours4\non the available computers and this constraint has made longer time integrations very difficult. To5\nfacilitate studies with this grid size, the length of the computational domain is also substantially6\nreduced compared to the length of the domains used in XD06a,b; Davies and Xing (2007); Berntsen7\net al. (2008). With such a short domain, the quality of the results from numerical experiments extended8\nover longer time will also be reduced due to false reflections at the open boundaries, see the discussion9\nin XD06b. The detailed results from the present studies depend on the the initial flow field and the10\ninitial stratification. The internal wave field over the first quarter of the second tidal period will for11\ninstance differ from the corresponding field over the first tidal cycle, and we can not expect to achieve12\na periodic solution. However, by comparing the results at the time of maximum inflow from the first13\ntidal cycle presented here with corresponding results from the second tidal cycle presented in XD06a;14\nDavies and Xing (2007); Berntsen et al. (2008), we find that the wave patterns in the lee of the sill are15\nvery similar.16\nThe experiments are performed with constant values of viscosity and diffusivity as in XD06a, that is:17\nhorizontal viscosity Ah = 10\n\u22121 m2 s\u22121, vertical viscosity AV = 10\n\u22123 m2 s\u22121, horizontal diffusivity Kh18\n= 10\u22127 m2 s\u22121, and vertical diffusivity KV = 10\n\u22127 m2 s\u22121. These values of viscosities and diffusivi-19\nties were maintained constant in one set of calculations. The values are small compared to the values20\ntypically used in ocean models with grid sizes of the order 1 km, and they are small enough to allow21\ninternal waves in the lee of the sill to be represented. With very small values of vertical and horizontal22\ndiffusivity, the mixing becomes primarily controlled by convective overturning and instabilities. How-23\never, due to the cascade of energy towards the grid scale in nonlinear systems, much larger values of24\nthe viscosities are needed, see XD06a,b; Berntsen et al. (2008). This set of values are in this paper25\nreferred to as \u201dsmall\u201d values. In order to explore the sensitivity to the viscosity and diffusivity, the26\n13\nexperiments are repeated with \u201dlarge\u201d values of viscosity and diffusivity namely: Ah = 1m\n2 s\u22121, AV1\n= 10\u22122 m2 s\u22121, Kh = 10\n\u22123 m2 s\u22121, and KV = 10\n\u22124 m2 s\u22121. The sensitivity of the numerical results to2\nthe subgrid scale closure for this tidally driven system was also investigated in more detail in Berntsen3\net al. (2008).4\nThe choices of viscosities and diffusivities given above are to some extent arbitrary even if there are5\nsome general guidelines. For instance, the first set of values are large enough to filter out the grid scale6\nnoise and at the same time small enough to allow the representation of the small scale physical processes7\nin the lee of the sill. In studies like this, unique optimal values of the viscosities and the diffusivities8\nmay not be obtained. The values of these parameters used in comparable studies may differ by orders9\nof magnitudes. The differences between the two corresponding sets of results produced with the small10\nand the large values may therefore provide some insight in the uncertainties due to the choice of subgrid11\nscale closure scheme.12\nTo identify the sensitivity of the solution and the non-hydrostatic effects to the grid size, the experi-13\nments, with both sets of values of viscosity and diffusivity, are repeated using the hydrostatic assumption14\nfor all values of \u2206x.15\nIn the experiments, the bottom stress vector \u03c4b(x, t) is specified by16\n\u03c4b(x, t) = \u03c10CD\nq\nu2b + v\n2\nbub(x, t) (6)\nwhere \u03c10 is the reference density, and ub and vb are the velocity components in the x-direction and the17\ncross channel direction respectively. The drag coefficient CD is given by18\nCD = max[0.0025,\n\u03ba2\n(ln(zb\/z0))2\n] (7)\n14\nand zb is the distance of the nearest grid point to the bottom. The von Karman constant \u03ba is 0.4 and1\nthe bottom roughness parameter is chosen to be z0 = 0.01m, see Blumberg and Mellor (1987).2\nThe following norm is used to measure the differences between model fields \u03c6H produced with the3\nhydrostatic model and model fields \u03c6NH produced with the non-hydrostatic model4\n\u2016 \u03c6H \u2212 \u03c6NH \u2016=\ns\n1\nArea\nZ 2000m\n0m\nZ \u03b7(x,t)\nH(x)\n(\u03c6H \u2212 \u03c6NH)2dxdz , (8)\nwhere Area is the area of the integration domain.5\nThe differences between instantaneous fields produced with different methods may be large due to small6\nshifts in the phase of the internal waves that occur in the lee of the sill during super-critical inflow.7\nTherefore, also the time mean fields8\n(u,w, \u0398) =\n1\nT\/8\nZ T\/4\nT\/8\n(u,w,\u0398)dt , (9)\nare computed to investigate whether the changes also affect these more robust means.9\nErrors in the internal pressure gradient estimation may be a problem in \u03c3-coordinate models, see for10\ninstance Haney (1991); Mellor et al. (1998). However, in the present experiments with relatively small11\ngrid sizes these errors are small. For instance in experiments with \u2206x = 100m where the flow is driven12\nonly by the artificial internal pressure gradients, the absolute value of the velocity components remains13\nsmaller than 1\u00d7 10\u22125 ms\u22121, see also Berntsen et al. (2008).14\n15\n3 Results1\nThe results from the calculations show that the maximum tidal velocity u across the sill is larger than2\n0.80m s\u22121 in all calculations. Using the same definition of the densimetric Froude number Fr as in3\nXD06a, that is Fr = uNHs where Hs is the sill depth, we find that Fr \u223c 5.3 at maximum inflow, see4\nalso the discussion in Farmer and Armi (1999) on the definition of the Froude number.5\nIn Figs. 2 to 8 the instantaneous non-hydrostatic pressure fields PNH at maximum inflow, t = 1\/4T ,6\nfor the experiments with small values of viscosities and diffusivities are given for all grid sizes. In order7\nto demonstrate the effects of the non-hydrostatic pressure corrections on the primary model fields, the8\ncorresponding temperature fields at maximum inflow for both the non-hydrostatic and the hydrostatic9\nexperiments are also given for identical parameters. The amplitudes of the non-hydrostatic pressure10\noscillations increase as \u2206x is reduced down to \u2206x = 3.125m. Notice that the contour interval (CI)11\nis increased with reduced values of \u2206x down to this grid size. The length scales of these pressure12\noscillations are reduced with decreasing values of the grid size down to at least \u2206x = 6.25m. The flow13\nis forced by the gradients in the pressure. Therefore, for the problem considered here we may expect14\ngradually stronger non-hydrostatic pressure effects on the primary variables (velocities, temperature,15\nand density) as the grid size is reduced from 100m down to approximately 3.125m in the studies with16\nsmall values of viscosities and diffusivities. Comparisons of the temperature fields after 1\/4 T produced17\nwith and without the non-hydrostatic corrections of the velocity fields also support this conclusion.18\nWith \u2206x = 100m, the temperature fields from the hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic experiments19\nare very similar. This suggests that with a coarse grid processes on short wavelengths are smoothed20\nout, the horizontal convergence\/divergence is reduced, and w and DwDt are reduced. As the grid size is21\nreduced, the non-hydrostatic effects on the temperature field become gradually more apparent. With22\na hydrostatic model dispersion due to non-hydrostatic effects is not included, and one may experience23\nnon-linear steepening of fronts and internal waves. Associated with this, there is a stronger transfer24\nof energy towards the shortest possible length scale 2\u2206x in a hydrostatic model. In Fig. 5c for \u2206x =25\n16\n12.5m we notice this steepening of the waves in the lee of the sill, and this tendency becomes more1\napparent as the grid size is further refined, see Figs. 6c to 8c.2\nIn the lee of sills, one may in observations find bodies of well mixed fluid, see for instance the discussions3\nof the processes generating the downstream wedge in Knight Inlet in Afanasyev and Peltier (2001a);4\nFarmer and Armi (2001); Afanasyev and Peltier (2001b). The present studies indicate that with a5\nhydrostatic model and sufficient spatial resolution, there may be a stronger transfer of energy towards6\nthe 2\u2206x scale, and then to irreversible mixing, that gradually builds up the body of well mixed fluid7\ndownstream. With a non-hydrostatic model, more of the energy remains in the internal wave field8\ngenerated in the lee during super-critical inflow. With small enough grid sizes, overturning vortices9\nthat create mixing may be found in the numerical results produced by a non-hydrostatic model, see10\nFigs. 7b and 8b. Thus, both types of models may create bodies of well mixed fluid in the lee. However,11\nthe mechanism when using a hydrostatic model is artificial, and hence it may be dubious to apply such12\na model in more quantitative studies of mixing.13\nIn all experiments bottom boundary layer separation occurs in the lee of the sill approximately between14\n40m to 65m depth between 400m and 550m from the top of the sill, see Figs. 2 to 8. This agrees15\nvery well with the position of the measured separation point in Loch Etive reported in Inall et al.16\n(2004), see their Fig. 5. The numerical separation point is fairly robust to the parameters investigated.17\nA horizontal length scale of the horizontal movements of the separation point may be estimated from18\n\u03bb =\nLsep\nHsep\nU\nN , see Afanasyev and Peltier (2001a). Here Lsep is the horizontal extent of the region of19\nthe slope on the lee side where the separation occur (150m), Hsep is the corresponding vertical extent20\n(32m), and U is a typical current speed near the separation point (0.20m s\u22121) giving a length scale \u03bb21\nof approximately 125m consistent with the range found in our numerical studies.22\nIn the results from all simulations, internal waves are found in the lee of the sill during maximum inflow,23\nsee Figs. 2 to 8. The length scales of these waves depend on the grid size. The length scales and the24\ngeneral shape of the internal waves may also be clearly affected by the non-hydrostatic pressure effects,25\n17\nespecially in the high resolution studies. In the results produced with \u2206x = 100m, the length scale of1\nthe downstream waves is approximately 1000m in both the hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic model2\nresults. With higher horizontal resolution, smaller scale waves may be represented, and we notice that3\nthe length scale of the waves is gradually reduced from 1000m to approximately 2-300m as \u2206x is4\nreduced to 12.5m in the non-hydrostatic studies, see Figs. 2b to 5b. In the results produced with the5\nnon-hydrostatic model and a grid size smaller than 12.5m, these internal waves with length scales from6\n200m to 300m are still found, even if also smaller scale oscillations become superimposed on these7\nwaves as the grid is further refined, see Figs. 6b to 8b. In the results produced with the hydrostatic8\nmodel, we may notice a similar reduction of the length scale of the internal waves as the grid size is9\nreduced to \u2206x = 12.5m. However, this length scale is also further reduced in the hydrostatic studies10\nwith smaller grid sizes than 12.5m. In the numerical results produced with the hydrostatic model and11\n\u2206x = 1.5625m, we may notice waves with length scales down to approximately 50m, see Fig. 8c and the12\ndiscussion above on missing non-hydrostatic dispersion and steepening of waves in hydrostatic models.13\nThe periods and amplitudes of the internal waves in the lee of the sill are correspondingly affected14\nby the grid size. This is clearly seen in the time series of the vertical velocities (Fig. 9) taken at a15\npoint downstream of the sill at (x, z) = (500m, -20m). For all grid sizes used here, internal waves are16\ngenerated when the flow over the sill becomes super-critical, Fr > 1, approximately after t = 1\/8 T (or17\n93 minutes). As the vertical oscillations become more sinusoidal, they grow in amplitude, and the period18\nis reduced as the grid size is reduced from 100m to 12.5m, see Fig. 9a. For \u2206x = 12.5m, the period is19\napproximately 7minutes. As the grid size is further reduced from 12.5m to 6.25m, the amplitudes of the20\nvertical velocity oscillations continue to grow at this point. However, these amplitudes are approximately21\nthe same in the experiments with \u2206x = 6.25m, 3.125m, and 1.5625m. By comparing the results for22\n\u2206x = 12.5m in Fig. 9a with corresponding results for finer grid sizes in Fig. 9b, it is apparent that with23\nsmaller \u2206x short time scale changes are added to the sinusoidal signals produced with \u2206x = 12.5m,24\neven if the periods of approximately 7minutes are still visible in the high resolution results. The vertical25\noscillations are strongly affected by the hydrostatic assumption, see Figs. 9b and 10. With a grid size26\n18\nof 1.5625m, the periods of these oscillations at (x, z) = (500m, -20m) are reduced to approximately1\n3minutes, consistent with the shorter length scale oscillations seen in Fig. 8c. By comparing Figs.2\n9b and 10 we also notice stronger vertical accelerations, \u2202W\u2202t , and that the negative vertical velocity3\ncomponents are much larger in magnitude (\u223c 1.5 ms\u22121) than the corresponding positive velocity4\ncomponents in the results from the hydrostatic study. In the hydrostatic experiments, forces from the5\nnon-hydrostatic pressure gradients acting against the downward flow in the lee are lacking, and the6\ndownward flow may therefore become unrealistically large in the high resolution hydrostatic studies7\n(Fig. 10). See also the comment in Hodges et al. (2006) that improved grid refinement in a hydrostatic8\nmodel may lead to worse results. The maximum values of the vertical velocity components in the non-9\nhydrostatic experiments are \u223c 0.65 ms\u22121. The horizontal velocity components in the lee of the sill10\nare of the same order of magnitude (Berntsen et al. (2008)). In the non-hydrostatic experiments these11\nvalues are consistent with rotary overturning rolls as described in Farmer and Armi (1999).12\nThe focus has so far been on the non-hydrostatic pressure effects on the instantaneous velocity and13\ntemperature fields. For some applications, where the focus is on the residual flow, it may be more14\nrelevant to study whether the velocity corrections due to non-hydrostatic pressure also affect the time15\nmean fields. In order to investigate this, time means of the velocity components and the temperature16\nfield are computed, see Equation (9). The means are taken over the last half of the simulation period.17\nThese time mean fields on the lee side of the sill are given in Figs. 11 and 12. These results are18\nproduced with \u2206x = 1.5625m, small and constant values of viscosity and diffusivity, and both the19\nhydrostatic and non-hydrostatic mean fields are given. The non-hydrostatic pressure corrections clearly20\naffect the downstream time mean fields. We notice for instance from Fig. 11 that near the surface in the21\noutflow area there is still water warmer than 13 oC in the results from the hydrostatic experiment. The22\ncorresponding 13 oC contour is missing in the outflow area in the time mean field produced with the23\nnon-hydrostatic model. The changes on the 12 oC contour by introducing non-hydrostatic pressure are24\nalso noticeable. These changes in the time mean temperature field may be due to changes in the mixing.25\nHowever, the time mean velocity fields are also affected by the non-hydrostatic pressure corrections,26\n19\nsee Fig. 12 and the discussion below, and therefore changes in the advection may also contribute to the1\nchanges in the time mean temperature field.2\nIn the non-hydrostatic results, the tongue of high velocity water near the surface extends much further3\ndownstream from the sill than in the corresponding hydrostatic results, notice for instance the 40 cm s\u221214\nisolines in Fig. 12a and 12b. Near the top of the sill, on the downstream side of it, there is also a5\nback-flow of water towards the sill in the time mean field from the non-hydrostatic experiment. This6\nback-flow is missing in the results from the corresponding hydrostatic experiment. Associated with the7\nhorizontal back-flow, there is an upward flow of water in the lee of the sill in the time mean velocity8\nfield from the non-hydrostatic experiment. The computed time mean velocity fields suggest that in the9\nnon-hydrostatic results there is a strong vortex in the lee of the sill in the period of super-critical flow.10\nThe non-hydrostatic pressure gradients in the lee near the top of the sill may explain the separation of11\nthe flow and the generation of a vortex in the non-hydrostatic simulations, see Fig. 8a and the zoom12\nin of this pressure in Fig. 13. The build up of the pressure field seen in Fig. 13 may qualitatively be13\nunderstood from the Bernoulli equation, see Kundu and Cohen (2008), which strictly speaking is for14\ninviscid, steady, barotropic flows. In the lee below the sill depth, the speed is reduced which means15\nbuild up of a counter pressure and possible flow separation. The flow separation will create higher16\nspeeds further up in the water column, explaining the negative pressure seen in Fig. 14. The vortex in17\nthe lee creates enhanced mixing explaining at least partly the non-hydrostatic effects on the time mean18\ntemperature field (Fig. 11).19\nThe flow separation in the lee and the overturning roll near the top of the sill are also seen in the plot of20\nthe instantaneous temperature field from the non-hydrostatic experiment (Fig. 8b) and in some of the21\nnon-hydrostatic results produced with \u2206x larger than 1.5625m, see Figs. 2b to 7b. However, the vortex22\ngradually becomes weaker with a coarser grid, and for \u2206x equal to 100m or 50m this overturning23\nbecomes both displaced and much weaker, see Figs. 2b and 3b. Thus with a too coarse grid to resolve24\nthe vortex, the model tends to filter these motions out.25\n20\nOverturning may also be seen in some of the results produced by the hydrostatic model. During over-1\nturning we are using the hydrostatic model outside its domain of validity. Even if this easily may2\ncreate instabilities, models based on the hydrostatic primitive equations may still be able to produce3\ninstances of inverse stratification. However, the overturning events produced by the hydrostatic model4\nin the present study are generally weaker and more distorted than the corresponding events produced5\nby the non-hydrostatic model, compare Figs. 7b and 7c and Figs. 8b and 8c.6\nThe plots of the time mean temperature fields (Fig. 11) suggest that the deeper separation point7\napproximately 500m from the top of the sill is less affected by the non-hydrostatic pressure effects.8\nThe second order norm, see Equation 8, may be used to measure the non-hydrostatic effects for different9\nvalues of\u2206x, see Figs. 14 and 15. The non-hydrostatic effects on the time mean fields are generally much10\nsmaller than the effects on the instantaneous fields. The instantaneous fields from the non-hydrostatic11\nexperiments may be out of phase with the corresponding fields from the hydrostatic experiments creat-12\ning fairly large values of this discrepancy measure. These short time scale effects tend to be filtered out13\nin the time mean fields. However, there are noticeable non-hydrostatic effects also on the time mean14\nfields, especially in the results from the experiments with small and constant values of viscosity and15\ndiffusivity. The results indicate that the effects on the time mean fields may become stronger as the16\ngrid size is reduced.17\nThe non-hydrostatic pressure is driven by the local convergence\/divergence into or out of the grid18\ncells of the provisional hydrostatic velocity field. This convergence\/divergence is strongly affected by19\nthe choice of viscosities and diffusivities. With large values of viscosity and diffusivity, small scale20\nvariability in the flow and in the temperature field will be smoothed out. We may expect less small21\nscale convergence\/divergence, and smaller non-hydrostatic pressure effects. This view may also find22\nsupport in the results given in Figs. 14 and 15. For the smaller values of \u2206x, the non-hydrostatic23\npressure effects are much larger in the experiments with small values of viscosity and diffusivity. In24\nthe numerical experiments with large values of viscosity, the non-hydrostatic effects on the horizontal25\n21\nvelocity field are generally small and also relatively robust to changes in \u2206x. For this case, the viscosity1\nis large enough to suppress small scale variability in the flow field, and a reduction in \u2206x will not2\nchange the computed flow fields significantly.3\nThe numerical investigations of non-hydrostatic pressure effects reported in Xing and Davies (2007)4\nwere performed with \u2206x = 10m near the sill, and with small and constant values of viscosity and5\ndiffusivity. The results presented here are consistent with their findings. However, the results given in6\nFigs. 14 and 15 suggest that a further reduction of \u2206x from 10m would have revealed even stronger7\nnon-hydrostatic effects.8\n22\n4 Discussion1\nIn this study the sensitivity of the non-hydrostatic pressure effects to the grid size is explored for the2\ncase of tidally driven stratified flow over a shallow sill in a loch. The study is motivated by earlier3\nstudies of the processes in Loch Etive based on both measurements and numerical investigations, see4\nInall et al. (2004, 2005); XD06a,b; Davies and Xing (2007); Xing and Davies (2007); Stashchuk et al.5\n(2007); Berntsen et al. (2008). The non-hydrostatic pressure effects depend on the viscosity and the6\ndiffusivity and this sensitivity is also addressed. The simulations are performed both with a hydrostatic7\nand a non-hydrostatic version of a terrain following ocean model, and horizontal grid sizes in the range8\nfrom 100m to 1.5625m are used.9\nThe characteristics of the flow are gradually changed as the grid size is reduced. The length scale of the10\ninternal waves appearing in the lee of the sill is for instance gradually reduced and the vertical motions11\nbecome more sinusoidal as the grid size is reduced from 100m to 12.5m. With a further reduction12\nof the grid size, more short time scale signals are gradually superimposed on these sinusoidal internal13\nwaves. Associated with the internal waves in the lee, there is a flow separation point. The position of14\nthis point is very robust to the parameters explored, and agrees well with the position of the measured15\nseparation point in Loch Etive.16\nIn many studies it may be more important to get the larger scale mean characteristics of the flow and17\nthe hydrography correct, than to capture all details of the flow. This study shows that there are strong18\nnon-hydrostatic effects both on the time mean flow field and the time mean density field. Consequently19\na model must have sufficient resolution to resolve the adjustments of the fields by the non-hydrostatic20\npressure.21\nIn the numerical results produced with the non-hydrostatic model and an adequate grid size, we find22\nflow separation also near the top of the sill in the lee, and an overturning vortex associated with the flow23\nseparation. This vortex is not found in the results from the non-hydrostatic model using grid sizes of24\n23\n100m or 50m. This vortex is also found in the time mean fields from the non-hydrostatic experiments,1\nbut not in the corresponding fields produced with the hydrostatic model. By using the non-hydrostatic2\nmodel and reducing the horizontal grid size from 25m down to 3.125m, the vortex gradually grows in3\nstrength. In the results produced with a grid size of 1.5625m, the overturning roll is almost equal to4\nthe same roll produced with a grid size of 3.125m. It would be tempting to conclude from this that5\nthe essential features of the vortex are resolved with a grid size of 3.125m. However, this may rather6\nindicate that for the finest grid size, the values of viscosity chosen are large enough to prohibit further7\nmodifications of the vortex. The experiments with even larger values of viscosity and diffusivity also8\nshow that the importance of the non-hydrostatic model pressure adjustments clearly depend on the9\ndegree of smoothing of the model fields, and for larger values of viscosity\/diffusivity the non-hydrostatic10\neffects may not continue to grow as the grid size is reduced.11\nIn numerical ocean modelling there is a general trend towards higher resolution and non-hydrostatic12\nmodels. Below we will try to put the present work in this wider perspective.13\nIn large scale ocean modelling based on the Reynolds averaged equations (RANS) with grid sizes larger14\nthan \u223c 1 km the hydrostatic approximation is valid, see Marshall et al. (1997b). Grid convergence may15\nbe demonstrated in RANS type simulations by using large values of eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity.16\nIn Avlesen et al. (2001) for instance it was shown that the numerical results from the present model17\nand the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), see Blumberg and Mellor (1987); Mellor (1996), converged to18\nthe same solution for density driven flow in a closed basin using large and constant values of viscosity19\nand diffusivity.20\nAt the other end of the spectrum are the DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations) models. Using DNS all21\nrelevant scales are resolved and parameterizations are not required. The grid size in DNS studies is \u223c22\n1mm and therefore it is not feasible to apply DNS on ocean scale problems. However, it may still be23\na good approach to test the non-hydrostatic ocean models on laboratory scale problems, see Rickard24\n24\net al. (2009). In Berntsen et al. (2006) it was also shown that the MITgcm (Marshall et al. (1997b,a))1\nand the present model produced grid converged solutions in lock release tank scale experiments.2\nA more tractable alternative is to apply Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This will require a grid size3\nin all spatial directions of \u223c 1m. In general this will probably not be possible in numerical studies on4\nocean scale within the foreseeable future (Fringer, 2009). The idealised 2D experiments described here5\nwith \u223c 1.5m resolution may, however, qualify as LES simulations.6\nIn the near future it will be more realistic to apply grid sizes in the range between \u223c 1 km and \u223c 1m.7\nIn this range non-hydrostatic pressure effects may be important, even if they are not fully accounted8\nfor as in LES or DNS. The focus in this study has been on demonstrating that these non-hydrostatic9\neffects may gradually become stronger as the grid size is reduced towards the grid scale associated10\nwith LES. When using small values of viscosity and diffusivity to allow smaller scale phenomena to11\nappear with smaller grid size, grid convergence may have to be sacrificed. With larger values of eddy12\nviscosity and eddy diffusivity or weaker tidal forcing, solutions that are robust to the grid size may13\nbe produced, see Berntsen et al. (2008). However, larger values of viscosity\/diffusivity also means that14\nreal physical phenomena that could have been represented with the chosen grid size, may not appear15\nin the numerical results.16\nThe results from the present studies indicate that for larger grid sizes, 50m or 100m in our case with17\ntidally driven flow over a sill, the non-hydrostatic pressure effects are relatively small. This finding has18\nimportant consequences for the planning of future 3D experiments for such systems. Unless we can19\nafford to apply a small enough horizontal grid size, it may be a waste of computer time to perform 3D20\nsill studies with non-hydrostatic models.21\nIn high resolution DNS studies, one may expect to find important 3D features of the flow superimposed22\non the 2D phenomena described here, see for instance Do\u00a8rnbrack (1998); Carnevale et al. (2001); Fringer23\nand Street (2003); Smyth et al. (2005). The volume of the model domains in DNS studies is, with the24\npresent computer systems, typically of the order 1m3. Thus it will not be feasible today to perform DNS25\n25\nstudies for a realistic sill domain. At present we therefore do not know how much more the numerical1\nsolutions will change if we continue to refine the grid. However, with a horizontal grid size of 1.5625m2\nwe are at least able to represent both the internal waves and the overturning vortices in the lee of the3\nsill. Both processes are strongly non-hydrostatic and important for the mixing in the lee of sills, see the4\nvery interesting discussions on the topic in Afanasyev and Peltier (2001a,b); Farmer and Armi (2001).5\nIt will be natural to ask for a better validation of the model using both model results and measure-6\nments from the real sill area. Such a comparison requires high resolution measurements from the study7\narea. In addition, detailed information about all forcing variables and all details of the topography8\nincluding stones and possible seaweed are needed to force the model and to ensure accurate descrip-9\ntions of the depth and the bed stress. Stones, gravel, and seaweed may even interact with the flow and10\ncomplicate a clean comparison between measurements and model results. For the present 2D study,11\nthe lack of all cross channel variability further complicates a quantitative validation procedure based12\non measurements.13\nThere is a growing literature pointing at the importance of the interactions between stratified flow14\nand topography and the associated irreversible mixing on the meridional overturning circulation, see15\nfor instance Wunsch (1970); Polzin et al. (1997); Samelson (1998); Munk and Wunsch (1998); Spall16\n(2001); Fringer and Street (2003); Kunze and Llewellyn Smith (2004); Wunsch and Ferrari (2004). The17\ngrid resolution of large scale models will in the foreseeable future be far to coarse to allow a good18\nrepresentations of these interactions and the mixing. Consequently the quality of the model outputs19\nfrom the large scale ocean models rely heavily on the quality of the parameterizations of the subgrid scale20\n(SGS) processes that they use. The remark made in Griffies (2004): \u201d there remains a large degree of21\nuncertainty in the SGS schemes appropriate for ocean climate simulations\u201d is unfortunately still valid.22\nA possible way forward may be to produce model results that capture the essential features of the23\ninteractions between stratified flow and topography and the associated irreversible mixing, using high24\nresolution, non-hydrostatic, preferably 3D, ocean models. Time mean fields of the primary variables may25\n26\nbe derived from the high resolution model fields. The exercises may be repeated with hydrostatic coarse1\nresolution models to investigate whether the models in combination with the chosen parameterizations2\nare able to reproduce the mean fields from the high resolution studies. Fjord or Loch areas may be3\nvery suitable for such exercises, and possible mismatches may also hopefully lead to improvements of4\nthe parameterizations.5\nAcknowledgements.
