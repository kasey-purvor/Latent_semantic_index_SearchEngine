The classical example for\nan underlying asset is a single stock, where interest rate\noptions and exchange rate options are further standard\ncontracts.\nWe consider as underlying asset a contingent claim g\ndependent on a multivariate process S (e. g. d stocks).\nAt expiration the price u of a, say, put option is clearly\nu(S, T ) = u0(S) := max (K \u2212 g(S), 0) . (1)\n1.1.2 European options\nIf S is modelled as geometric Brownian motion dSi =\n\u00b5iSidt + \u03c3idWi with drifts \u00b5i, constant volatilities \u03c3i\nand Wiener processes Wi like in the original studies by\nBlack, Merton and Scholes [1], the option price follows\nthe PDE\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ LBSu = 0, (2)\nLBSu :=\n1\n2\nn\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u03c3i\u03c3j\u03c1ijSiSj\n\u22022u\n\u2202Si\u2202Sj\n+ r\nn\u2211\ni=1\nSi\n\u2202u\n\u2202Si\n\u2212 ru,\nwhich can be solved backwards in time from the termi-\nnal condition (1). Here \u03c1ij are the asset corelations and\nr the risk-free interest rate, which are both assumed to\nbe constant. Despite well-known deficiencies the Black-\nScholes model is still most widely used among practition-\ners. Moreover, it can serve as a basis for homogenisation\napproaches [7].\nAs a multi-dimensional example we will consider in\nthe following a basket of stocks, g(S) =\n\u2211\n\u00b5iSi, with\npositive weights \u00b5i. After time reversion the Black-Scholes-\nPDE forms the initial value problem\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n\u2212 LBSu = 0 \u2200(S, t) \u2208 R\nn\n+ \u00d7 (0, T ), (3)\nu(S, 0) = u0(S) =\n(\nK \u2212\nd\u2211\ni=1\n\u00b5iSi\n)\n+\n\u2200S \u2208 Rd+.\nFor Si = 0 natural boundary conditions hold (note that\nall coefficients vanish as Si \u2192 0), for |S| \u2192 \u221e asymp-\ntotical values can be set as Dirichlet conditions.\nNote also that the equation is invariant under rescal-\ning of the asset variables, so without loss of generality\nthe domain can be taken as [0, 1]d. The only reference\nvalue is then the strike price K.\n1.1.3 American options\nIn the case of American contracts the option price is\nsubject to an inequality constraint and can be shown [17]\n2 Christoph Reisinger, Gabriel Wittum\nto be the solution of the linear complementarity problem\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n\u2212 LBSu \u2264 0, (4)\nu \u2265 g, (5)(\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n\u2212 LBSu\n)\n\u00b7 (u\u2212 g) = 0 (6)\nwith g = u0 and initial and boundary values as in the\nEuropean case.\n1.2 Transformations\nIn the following we study various formulations of (3) in\ndifferent coordinates. Due to the special structure of the\nBlack-Scholes model, it can be transformed into a more\nconvenient form. The widely used \u2018log price\u2019 yi := lnSi\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 d) leads to a problem with constant coefficients\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n1\n2\nd\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u03c3i\u03c3j\u03c1ij\n\u22022u\n\u2202yi\u2202yj\n+\nd\u2211\ni=1\n(r \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03c32i )\n\u2202u\n\u2202yi\n\u2212 ru\n\u2200(y, t) \u2208 Rn \u00d7 (0, T ), (7)\nu(y, 0) = u0(e\ny) =\n(\nK \u2212\nd\u2211\ni=1\n\u00b5ie\ny\ni\n)\n+\n\u2200y \u2208 Rd.\nNow transformation of the diffusion operator to diagonal\nform, \u039b = Q\u03a3QT , further simplifies the system via ro-\ntation and translation z := Qy\u2212 tb (bi :=\n\u2211d\nj=1 qij(r \u2212\n1\n2\u03c3\n2\nj )):\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n1\n2\nd\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi\n\u22022u\n\u2202zi2\n\u2212 ru \u2200(z, t) \u2208 Rd \u00d7 (0, T ), (8)\nu(z, 0) = u0(e\nQTz) \u2200z \u2208 Rd.\nThis formulation is an ideal starting point for principal\ncomponent analysis and dimension reduction techniques\nthat are inevitable for high-dimensional problems [14].\nIn the case of basket options the following trans-\nformation, where the basket itself serves as a variable\n(x1 =\n\u2211\ni \u00b5iSi) and the other coordinates (x2, . . . , xd)\nparametrise its level sets (see also Fig. 1), proved very\nuseful:\nS1 = x1x2, (9)\nSi = x1xi+1\ni\u220f\nk=2\n(1\u2212 xk), 2 < i < d, (10)\nSd = x1\nd\u220f\nk=2\n(1\u2212 xk). (11)\nThis leads to a parabolic equation of the type\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\nd\u2211\ni,j=1\naij(x)\n\u22022u\n\u2202xi\u2202xj\n+\nd\u2211\ni=1\nbi(x)\n\u2202u\n\u2202xi\n+ ru = 0 (12)\nwith polynomial coefficients. For details see [14]. De-\npending on the dimensionality and the required accuracy\nall these formulations can be useful.\nS1\nS2\n-\n6\n@\n@\n@\nx1\nx2\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\n\u00a1\u00b5\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@I\n@@ @\n@\n@\n@\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\u00a3\n\u00b3\u00b3\n\u00b3\u00b3\nFig. 1. d = 2: x1 = s1 + S2, x2 = S1\/(S1 + S2)\nFor other contracts or more general models for the\nasset price movement, e. g. with stochastic volatilities or\ninterest rates, equations of similar structure arise, par-\nticularly diffusion (and often convection) over boundary\nfaces vanish. This is a necessary (and sufficient) condi-\ntion for the underlying stochastic processes to be bounded\nin the respective dimensions and guarantees uniqueness\nof the solution of the parabolic problem without bound-\nary conditions [18].

This type of problem has been thoroughly\nstudied in the literature, see e. g. [11] for an exten-\nsive survey of numerical results for different types of\npoint, line and plane smoothers for the anisotropic three-\ndimensional Poisson equation or [12] for the application\nof plane smoothers for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equa-\ntions.\nIn this paper we will focus on the last aspect.\nOn Multigrid for Anisotropic Equations and Variational Inequalities 3\n1.3.2 Linear complementarity problems\nIf the solution is subject to complementarity conditions,\nthis requires additional consideration. The crucial point\nis the construction of suitable transfer operators that\npreserve complementarity in the coarsening process.\nBrandt and Cryer [3] study variants of Brandts full\napproximation scheme, where projected SOR-sweeps [5]\nare used as smoother. They choose essentially injection,\nwhich gives satisfactory results for porous flow through\na dam, but due to the reduced order leads to strongly\ndeteriorated convergence rates in problems with varying\ncoefficients.\nHoppe, Kornhuber [8], and Wittum [10] modify the\ntransfer operators at the free boundary such that pro-\nlongation and restriction are performed on active and\ninactive sets seperately. In other words, the coarse grid\ncorrection is switched off for the free boundary while still\npreserving the order of the transfer operators.\nBraess et al. [2] avoid this problem altogether in a cas-\ncadic technique, where obviously no restriction is needed.\nHowever, in this \u2018one way\u2019 approach low-frequency errors\ncan not be reduced efficiently once a finer level has been\nreached, which is a problem if the solution needs to be\nknown very exactly (beyond discretisation error).\n1.3.3 Applications in option pricing\nKo\u02c7cvara et al. [15] propose for American option pric-\ning equations a combined (one level) iteration with a\nsequence of projected SSOR steps followed by CG steps\nrestricted to the inactive set. This gives considerably im-\nproved convergence compared to a simple projected it-\neration and works well for sufficiently well-conditioned\nsystems.\nClarke and Parrott [4] successfully apply a multigrid\niteration with a hybrid-smoother that combines global\nprojected point Gauss-Seidel with line smoothing on the\ninactive set for a one-factor model with stochastic volatil-\nity.\nOosterlee [13] studies the same problem and improves\nthe results of Brandt and Cryer for the setting of varying\ncoefficients by iterant recombination.\n1.4 Outline\nIn section 2 we will study numerically the robustness of\nvarious block smoothers for problems of different dimen-\nsionality (d = 2, 3, 4). In d dimensions naturally blocks\nof dimensionality 0 to d can be chosen (2.2.1 to 2.2.3).\nFor the (approximate) inversion of the blocks CG-type\nsolvers and recursively applied multigrid methods are\ncompared.\nSection 3 confers this approach to obstacle problems.\nAdditional attention is devoted to the grid transfer (3.3),\nwhere we introduce one-sided transfer operators at the\nfree boundary. Full multigrid (3.4) provides a good initial\napproximation for the active set, where smoothing is also\nperformed plane-wise (3.5). Finally we compare with a\ncascadic strategy (3.6).\n2 Multigrid for anisotropic problems\nIn this section we are concerned with the efficiency of\niterative solution methods for linear equations\nAhuh = bh\narising from space \u2014 e. g. finite difference \u2014 and (im-\nplicit) time discretisations \u2014 e. g. the \u03b8-scheme \u2014 of\nequations of the type introduced in the previous section.\nWe will denote this problem by LP(Ah,bh). Particularly,\nwe study multigrid methods with levels l = 1, . . . , L,\ntransfer operators I l\u22121l (restriction) and I\nl\nl\u22121 (prolon-\ngation). The coarse grid matrices are obtained by the\nGalerkin ansatz Al\u22121 = I l\u22121l A\nlI ll\u22121.\nFor future reference and comparison with the com-\nplementarity problems we list here the standard V-cycle\nfor linear problems.\nAlgorithm 1 V-Cycle\nprocedure V(l, Al, bl, ul)\nbegin\nif l = 1 then\nu1 \u2190 LP(A1, b1);\nelse begin\nul \u2190 S(Al, bl, ul); (pre-smoothing)\nrl = bl \u2212Aul;\nrl\u22121 = I l\u22121l r\nl;\ndl\u22121 \u2190 V(l \u2212 1, Al\u22121, rl\u22121, dl\u22121);\ndl = I ll\u22121d\nl\u22121;\nul = ul + dl;\nul \u2190 S(Al, bl, ul); (post-smoothing)\nend\nreturn V-Cycle\nThere are several approaches to deal with inhomo-\ngeneities and anisotropies in a (here: geometric) mul-\ntilevel context. We can point out three main classes,\nassigned to the different components of the multigrid\nmethod: block-smoothing (blocks with weak coupling are\ninverted collectively), semi-coarsening (coarsening of the\ngrid in the direction of the anisotropy only) and matrix-\ndependent grid transfer. The latter is not required here\nas the discrete relative jumps of the coefficients on the\ngrid that appear at the boundary are of moderate size.\nIn the following subsections we will investigate vari-\nous block smoothers in greater detail.\n2.1 Hyperplane smoothers\nThe degeneracy of the partial differential equation at the\nboundary, as described in 1.2 (see (13), (14)), strongly\nsuggests the use of block-smoothers where planes orthog-\nonal\/parallel to the boundaries are inverted simultane-\nously. As can be expected, accurate solutions of these\nequations are not necessary and normally a reduction\nof the residual by a factor about 0.1 will suffice to pro-\nvide smoothing properties. This can be achieved by some\nCG-type steps or a few (typically one) MG-cycles.\n4 Christoph Reisinger, Gabriel Wittum\nMore precisely, if the index set of the scalar unknowns\non a tensor product grid is\nI = {1 \u2264 i \u2264 n},\nwhere i is a multiindex and n = (n1, . . . , nd) is the length\nof the grid in the different directions (yielding a total of\nN = n1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7nd unknowns) we define (d\u2212m)-dimensional\nblocks\nIj1,...,jmk1,...,km = {1 \u2264 i \u2264 n : ik1 = j1, . . . , ikm = jm},\ni. e. the coordinates in the m directions k1, . . . , km are\nkept fixed at j1, . . . , jm. The number of blocks is then\nM = (n1 \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 nm)\/(nk1 \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 nkm). For simplicity we\ndenote for fixed k1, . . . , km, j1, . . . , jm the M blocks by\nI1, . . . , IM , so that I = I1\u222a\u02d9 . . . \u222a\u02d9IM . This partitioning\ncorresponds to blocks of vectors ui, bi and matrices Aij ,\n1 \u2264 i, j \u2264M , and induces a block Gau\u00df-Seidel algorithm\nof the form\nuk+1i = A\n\u22121\nii\n(\nbi \u2212\n\u2211\nj<i\nAiju\nk+1\nj \u2212\n\u2211\nj>i\nAiju\nk\nj\n)\n. (16)\nFor two and three dimensions the case m = 1 is known\nas line smoothing, the case m = 2 as plane smoothing.\nGenerally speaking, we will study the extreme casesm =\nd (direct solver), m = d \u2212 1 (hyper-plane smoother),\nm = 1 (line smoother) and m = 0 (point smoother).\nIf not indicated differently, all non-trivial block-sys-\ntems in the following numerical tests are solved by Bi-\nCGSTAB [16] as are the coarse grid problems.\n2.2 Numerical tests\nFor the numerical tests we study model problem (3) with\na few uncorrelated assets (d = 2, 3, 4), \u03c3i = 0.4, r =\n0.05, T = 1, K = 0.25.

The alternating line smoother\nno longer shows multigrid efficiency and in spite of im-\nproved convergence rates compared to the point smoother\nis less efficient due to the higher cost involved (see Fig. 3,\nTable 3). Only the alternating plane smoother is robust\nand shows satisfactory rates.\nHowever, since the number of CG-iterations required\nfor the approximate solution of the plane systems in-\ncreases proportional to the number of points in each di-\nrection (i. e. the square root of the condition number of\nthe block systems), the solver still shows no linear com-\nplexity.\nIn fact, if we have n points in each of d directions, we\nhave to solve d \u00b7n block systems per alternating smooth-\ning step. The number of points in each hyperplane is\nnd\u22121, the grid size n\u22121 yields a condition number pro-\nportional to n2. Consequently, for an error reduction by\na fixed factor \u00b22, O(n) Bi-CGSTAB iterations are re-\nquired with a cost of O(nd\u22121) each.

For practical problems, though, the\nlatter method is still too expensive due to the additional\ncost for the construction of a hierarchy of systems for\nthe planes.\n2.2.3 Higher dimensions\nAlready in four dimensions we see that for practically\ncomputable problems a plain conjugate gradient method\nis superior to the multigrid technique with blockwise\nsmoothing on 3-dimensional hyperplanes (Table 4). The\n(uniform) grid size is not small enough to show the ad-\nvantageous asymptotical properties of the multilevel ap-\nproach.\nHowever, for strongly anisotropic meshes, as they are\nencountered e. g. with the sparse grid combination tech-\nnique [14], where often a large share of the points is dis-\ntributed in lower-(1-,2-,3-)dimensional planes, multigrid\napplied recursively in plane smoothing is the method of\nchoice.\n6 Christoph Reisinger, Gabriel Wittum\nTable 5. 3D transformed equation: Average convergence rate\n\u03c1\u00af, number of iterations it and CPU-time T (sec) for an error\nreduction of 10\u22126 on grid levels l = 4, . . . , 7 (4913 to 2146691\npoints) for the plane smoother\nl 4 5 6 7\n\u03c1\u00af 3.8 \u00b7 10\u22124 5.3 \u00b7 10\u22122 2.9 \u00b7 10\u22122 6.1 \u00b7 10\u22122\nit 2 3 4 5\nT 0.25 3.3 45 591\n2.2.4 Transformed equations\nTo look further into the robustness of the plane smoother\nwe check the convergence for the transformed equation\n(12).

A generalisation to the non-\nsymmetric case seems not straightforward.\nTherefore we employ a Bi-CG accelaration of pro-\njected Gau\u00df-Seidel, similar to SSORP-PCG as proposed\nin [15] (for symmetric systems). In each iteration we per-\nform m SOR-steps followed by s Bi-CGSTAB steps re-\nstricted to the inactive set. Typically we choose m = 1\nand s such that the residual is reduced by a factor \u00b2, e. g.\n\u00b2 = 0.3.\n3.3 Grid transfer\nFor the restriction operator a minimum requirement is\nthat for the exact discrete solution (uh) of LCP(Ah, bh,\nch)\nI\u00afhH(Ahuh \u2212 bh) \u2265 0,\nI\u02c6hH(ch \u2212 uh) \u2264 0,\nI\u00afhH(Ahuh \u2212 bh) ?

The use of injection, which clearly\nfulfils (26), implies deteriorated convergence.\nFollowing [8,10] we introduce one-sided restriction\noperators at the free boundary as\nI\u00afhHuh(xh) =\n{\nIhH u\u00af\nA\nh if xh \u2208 A,\nIhH u\u00af\nI\nh if xh \u2208 I,\n(27)\nwith full weighting IhH and\nu\u00af\nA\/I\nh (xh) =\n{\nuh(xh) if xh \u2208 A\/I,\n0 else.\nOn Multigrid for Anisotropic Equations and Variational Inequalities 7\n5 10 15 20 25\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n-\n-\n-\nPSfrag replacements\nlog10\u00b2\nW\nbil\nbil\ninj\npro\npropro\nFig. 5. 2D obstacle problem: Error reduction \u00b2 vs. work units\nW for V(1,1) cycles: injection and bilinear interpolation, pro-\njected full-weighting and bilinear interpolation, projected full\nweighting and projected bilinear interpolation\nHere A and I are the discrete active and inactive sets,\nrespectively (for simplicity of notation the subscript h is\nsupressed).

The fol-\nlowing numerical data were obtained with a smoother\nmotivated by the one introduced in [4] (see subsection\n3.5).\nWe clearly see from Fig. 5 the lost approximation\norder of injection. With one-sided (projected) transfer\noperators as introduced above the rates are roughly the\nsame as in the unrestricted case once the active set has\nbeen found. However, in the initial phase convergence is\nretarded as the free boundary is only corrected on the\nfinest grid. If bilinear prolongation is not restricted to the\nactive set, this can be partly avoided. In Fig. 5 the jumps\nof the residual indicate the shifts of the free boundary.\nA good initial approximation of the active set can be\nobtained from coarser levels by full multigrid cycles.\n3.4 Full multigrid\nEvidently a fast finding of the active set is vital for the\noverall convergence.
