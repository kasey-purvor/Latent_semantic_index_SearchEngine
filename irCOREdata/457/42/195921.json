The triumph of anything is a matter \nof organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of \nthe Mafia.\u2019 (Kurt Vonnegut, in Griffiths 1980: 107) \n \nIntroduction \n \nAngels are rarely thought relevant to theories of organization1\n \n. In this paper I will survey their various \nincarnations, from violent monsters to contemporary spirit guides, but paying particular attention to one \nof the first descriptions of hierarchy. This comes from the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, about 1500 years \nago. Despite the fact that he was ordering the world of angels, he suggests both ontological and political \nreasons for accepting that both celestial and secular organization must equal hierarchy. This is an \nassumption that is rarely contested even today, and the idea of hierarchy is central to theories of \norganization, and justifications of the managerial prerogative. However, angels have been mutable \ncreatures, and I employ their differences in order to open up this 5th century common sense. I conclude by \nsuggesting that angelic obedience should be treated with suspicion, and that other sorts of angels, \nparticularly the fallen ones, might lead us away from the tyranny of hierarchy. \nThe key argument of this paper is to show that mediaeval debates about angels translated theological \nconcerns into political legitimations, and to suggest that contemporary managerialism still operates within \nthe shadow of these assumptions. There seem to me to be two implications of these arguments. First, that \nan understanding of \u2018organization\u2019 can be drawn from a wide range of cultural sources. Second, that \ninterrogating central concepts in organization studies in this manner can weaken their power as a form of \ncommon sense. There is no necessary connection between the former argument, which merely extends \nthe domain of organization studies, and the latter, which reads critique into the results of such an \nextension. It is quite possible that some readers will translate 5th century angelic hierarchy into a lesson \nconcerning proper forms of contemporary governance and order. However, I choose to side with Lucifer, \nand to position the angels as enemies of a critical project, particularly if the project involves the extension \nand celebration of more local and less hierarchical organizational forms (Parker, Fournier and Reedy \n2007).  \n \n\u2018Organization\u2019 is a concept that refers generally to any sort of patterning, a fairly durable set of relations \nbetween people and things. However, it seems that dominant contemporary understandings of \norganization make this concept almost equivalent to concepts such as management, and hierarchy, and \neven capitalism (Blaug 1999, Parker 2002a). Fournier and Grey (2000) suggest that one of the features of \ncritical work in management studies is \u2018denaturalisation\u2019. That is to say, when someone suggests that \nsomething is inevitable or eternal, it is helpful if the concept can be historicised and even shown to be \ncontingent. It seems to me that hierarchy is one such concept, and that the story of Pseudo-Dionysius and \nthe angels helps us to denaturalise hierarchy, and think more clearly about what this concept involves. \nHowever, in this paper I do not offer an alternative theory of organization, but will (at the end) simply \npoint to places where alternatives might be found. My purpose here is not to build new theory, but to \nplace a particular word back into history, where it belongs. But first, we need to meet the angels. \n \nMonsters \n \nAngels can be found in Judaism (including Kabbalism), Catholicism, Orthodox and Protestant \nChristianity, Islam, Mormonism and many denominations, sects and cults. Angelic and demonic spirits \n(devas and asuras) can be found in Hinduism, and angelic spirits (devas) in Buddism.  \n\u2018Without committing myself religiously I could conceive of the possibility of there being, in \ndimensions and worlds other than our own, powers and intelligences outside our present \napprehension, and in this sense angels are not to be ruled out as a part of reality - always \n 3 \nremembering that we create what we believe. Indeed, I am prepared to say that if enough of us believe \nin angels, then angels exist.\u2019 (Davidson 1971: xii) \nSo, in a real sense angels exist. But are they humans, with wings? Ornithanthropus? In the Mervyn Peake \nnovel, Mr Pye, our hero oscillates between growing wings and horns, depending on whether he has been \ngood or bad. Both are freakish, \u2018for after all wings are not the monopoly of the seraphim but equally to be \nfound upon the backs of ducks\u2019 (1972: 136)2\n \n Mr Pye\u2019s wings result in strange bulges under his shirt, whilst \nhis horns have to be covered by a hat. Both present him with severe social problems. Whatever the \nshamans of the contemporary new age might claim, angels are also monstrous. \nWe might begin with winged Egyptian gods from three and a half thousand years ago, the Zoroastrian \nGods of 600 BCE Persia, and the ancient Greek Eros. The Etruscan and Greek angels of death were \nwinged too, Charun and Thanatos (Ward and Steeds 2005: 225). Or perhaps we should look towards the \nAssyrian or Akkadian Kerubim (winged bulls) who, according to Theodorus, Bishop of Heraclea in the 4th \ncentury, were \u2018horrible visions of Beasts, which might terrifie Adam from the entrance of paradise\u2019 (in \nDavidson 1971: 86). Lamborn Wilson, borrowing from a variety of Islamic sources, suggests that \u2018From \nthe soles of his feet to his head, Israfil, the Angel of the Day of Judgment, has hairs and tongues over \nwhich are stretched veils\u2019. Mika\u2019il is covered with saffron coloured hairs. \u2018On each hair he has a million \nfaces and each face a million eyes and a million tongues. Each tongue speaks a million languages and from \neach eye falls 70,000 tears.\u2019 Jibra\u2019il has the sun between his eyes and wings that stretch from the East to \nthe West. The Angel of Death, Azreal, has four faces, four wings and his body is covered with \ninnumerable eyes. \u2018When one of these eyes closes, a creature dies\u2019 (1980: 35-36) \n \nIn the Bible, angels are terrifying too. Perhaps as an ironic joke, \u2018Fear not!\u2019 is usually the first thing that \nthey say to the wide-eyed mortal. The Angel who came to Daniel had a face like lightening, eyes like \nflaming torches, and spoke with the roar of a crowd (Daniel 10). Ezekiel 1 has a depiction of an angel with \nfour faces like animals, crossed wings, wheels within wheels adorned with eyes, flaming fire and so on. \nThese angels are also mass murderers. In II Kings 19, an Angel kills 135 000 Assyrian soldiers in one night, \nwhilst in I Chronicles 21 70 000 Israelites are slaughtered. In Exodus 12, an angel kills the first born child of \nevery Egyptian and Israeli family that has not offered a blood sacrifice by midnight. In Matthew 13, we are \ntold that it will be the angels who separate us into those who will be saved, and those to be cast into the \nfurnace of fire. Indeed, in several places in the bible we are told that the day of judgement will be one in \nwhich the angels will be causing wailing and gnashing of teeth as they dispose of those who have refused \nto obey. \n \nThe point is that it took a while before these monsters and psychopaths became transformed into gentle \nsuperheroes with white wings. Gilles N\u00e9ret allows us to see this change from about 400 years ago. The \n\u2018promoted genies\u2019 (such as cherubim and seraphim) can be seen in Christian myth from around the 4th \ncentury, but their wings were often blue, green, red, striped, or peacock, or the cherubim were slickly red \nall over (see N\u00e9ret 2004 for illustrations). In Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s The Fall of the Rebel Angels from \n1562, and Frans Floris\u2019s painting of the same title from 1600, the rebels are shown as mutants with heads \nlike fish or lions, wings of butterflies, arms like crabs, bellies bursting with eggs. But, at the top of the \npicture, the good angels are looking serious and wearing partly white clothing, and their wings are mostly \nwhite. The fallen angels can have the wings of bats, as in Gustav Dor\u00e9\u2019s 19th century illustrations of \nMilton\u2019s Paradise Lost, but the closer we get to the present, the prettier the good angels get. \n \nHierarchy \n \n\u2018God and nature bid the same. \nWhen he who rules is worthiest, and excels \nThem whom he governs.\u2019  \nParadise Lost VI, 176-178 \n \nWithin the Abrahamic religions, and is those that I will be concentrating on from now on in this paper, \nthere is a good reason for the angels to be rather stern. It is simply that they are only following orders. \nAngels (apart from the fallen ones) do not have free will. Made by God, they follow His instructions3. \nThey are His representatives, and their existence helps human beings solve a major epistemological \nproblem. How can humans know God? We are small and limited, whilst God is entire and complete. Our \n 4 \nbeing, our substance can only allow us to glimpse the smallest part of Him. If we got any closer to His \nlight of infinite brightness and heat we would simply shrivel like moths. This is clearly a problem. The \nusual solution is to suggest that re\/presentation is needed to relay His glory. Hence, in the Christian \ntradition, \u2018theophany\u2019, the showing of God, the symbolization or presence of God in some other thing. \nThis is the moment where difference comes into the world, when representation is needed4\n \n, and when \nangels become important. The first Ecumenical Council of Nicea in 325 legitimated angels as part of \nGod\u2019s creation, whilst another, in 342, asserted that angels should not be worshipped. This oscillation is \ncrucial to later angelology. Are angels different from God, or different from Man, or different from both? \nFor Pseudo-Dionysius, (or Dionysius, or Denys) the Areopagite, in the 5th or early 6th century, the re-\npresentation of God must be ordered in order that relations between things could be properly \nunderstood5\n \n. Angels filled an entire universe of re-presentation, spreading His light downwards but taking \na little brilliance off it with each step. At the bottom, humble humans could now enjoy His light without \ncontradiction. The Corpus Areopagiticum is first mentioned in 532 CE, but no-one knows who wrote it, and \nhence what the author\u2019s real name was (see Pelikan 1987, Keck 1998: 55). He was possibly a Bishop, but \nwhether of Paris, or Antioch, or Athens, is not known. He may have been a Syrian monk, or Peter the \nIberian, a Georgian theologian. There is a legend that he was the same Dionysius who was converted by \nPaul in Athens (Acts 17), and was seen at the death of the Virgin Mary, standing between Gabriel and \nMichael. Indeed, it was precisely this near apostolic authority that gave his schema legitimacy within \nMedieval angelology (Keck 1998: 56). \nThis confusion seems appropriate, for the origins of hierarchy should not be too clear. If origins were not \nshrouded in mystery, they might be questioned as mere fabulation. Perhaps mindful of such difficulties, \neven Pseudo-Dionysius does something to cover his tracks by claiming that his teacher, the \u2018most Holy \nHierotheus\u2019, who wrote The Elements of Theology, inspired most of his ideas. There is no record of such a \nperson, or of such a book, and Luibheid (1987: 69) suggests that this was merely part of the overall fiction, \na strategy that often appeared to involve naming other fictional texts, or writing as if this were a letter to \nsomeone else. Exactly why Pseudo-Dionysius was concealing his identity, and the provenance of his ideas, \nis unclear, but when accusations of unorthodoxy were so dangerous to court, anonymity was probably not \na bad idea. (This is a strategy employed by many later utopian authors.) Even if the cover was blown, the \nold Hierotheus could be blamed, since they could be claimed to be his ideas in the first place. The \ndisplacement of responsibility was hence nicely emplaced, which seems appropriate where angels are \nconcerned. \n \nThe key philosophical problem that Pseudo-Dionysius deals with in writings such as \u2018The Divine Names\u2019 \nand \u2018The Mystical Theology\u2019 is how to understand and praise \u2018the name which is above every name\u2019, \u2018the \nsource, and the cause, the number and the order of the one, of number, and of all being\u2019 (in Luibheid \n1987: 54, 129). How could vulgar words or symbols capture \u2018the Cause of all things who is beyond \nthings\u2019? (op cit: 138). How can we describe the indescribable, understand the transcendent? The heresy of \nidolatry always lurks, in which we worship the symbol, not God. One of Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s strategies to \navoid such errors was to proceed by refining language in order that, by dismissing its earthy referents, we \ncould move towards that which cannot be grasped through language, but can be glimpsed. Such a \npurifying process he describes as climbing higher or clearing aside. However, there is another strategy that \nhe puts forward, which is to proceed downwards from that which cannot be grasped, to its imperfect \nmanifestations on earth. Since He has made the heavenly hierarchies known to us in various ways, these \nmust be ordered theophanies, and this in turn suggests that \u2018Order and rank here below are a sign of \nharmonious ordering toward the divine realm.\u2019 (op cit: 146). \n \nThe two main parts of Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s writings that are of interest to us here are \u2018The Celestial \nHierarchy\u2019 and \u2018The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\u2019. These are arguments for cultivated men, not superstitions \nabout monsters. The vulgar beliefs of the masses are dismissed as mad fantasies, in which animal-like \ncreatures roam the skies with \u2018great moos\u2019 (op cit: 148). Real knowledge is not for everyone, because not \neveryone has the subtlety to comprehend the sacred, or the ability to see behind appearances. In fact, it \nseems, only those people who are already part of the hierarchy could really understand it because \u2018a \nhierarchy is a sacred order, a state of understanding and an activity approximating as closely as possible to \nthe divine\u2019 (op cit: 153). The whole point of hierarchy is its perfection, its distribution of representations of \nthe divine. \n 5 \n\u2018The goal of a hierarchy, then, is to enable beings to be as like as possible to God and to be at one \nwith him. A hierarchy has God as its leader of all understanding and action. It is forever looking \ndirectly at the comeliness of God. A hierarchy bears in itself the mark of God. Hierarchy causes its \nmembers to be images of God in all respects, to be clear and spotless mirrors reflecting the glow of \nprimordial light and indeed of God himself. It ensures that when its members have received this \nfull and divine splendour they can then pass on this light generously and in accordance with God\u2019s \nwill to beings further down the scale.\u2019 (op cit: 154) \n \nThere is an interesting logical trick going on here, as well as the legitimation of earthly social order. By \nclaiming that hierarchy is a \u2018perfect arrangement\u2019, it becomes both one thing and many, an organization \nthat is greater than the sum of its parts. The representation problem is not actually solved, but dissolved \ninto a state of affairs where the many (the empirical world) reflects the one (God) through their very \nrelations (angels). \n\u2018Therefore, when the hierarchic order lays it on some to be purified and on others to do the \npurifying, on some to receive illumination and on others to cause illumination, on some to be \nperfected and on others to bring about perfection, each will actually imitate God in the way suitable \nto whatever role it has.\u2019 (op cit) \nThis solution is fascinating, making organization into the mediating term between perfectionist monism \nand an atomism that allows humans to be humans. It allows both to be, and the question becomes one of \nscale, symbolised as vertical elevation, or centrality. The One, despite the fact that it is everything, is \npositioned at the top of a two or three dimensional space. A space that places all other locations in a \nsubordinate position to it. This is not a necessary implication of organization, as a relation between things, \nbut it is the one chosen here. \n \nIn detail, what Pseudo-Dionysius announces is an arrangement of threes, a number beloved of Neo-\nPlatonists. In the first hierarchy we have the thrones, cherubim and seraphim; in the second, the \nauthorities, dominions (or dominations) and powers, and in the third, the angels, archangels, and \nprincipalities. Each rank of celestial being has distinct capacities and responsibilities, and these are \ndescribed with considerable confidence. While he begins by insisting that within each hierarchy there is \nequality between the three orders, by the time he gets to describing the last order, \u2018every hierarchy has \nfirst, middle and last powers\u2019 (op cit: 170). Each ranks functions as a messenger for the one above it, and \neach subordinate is uplifted and held in place by the message that they receive. In his work \u2018The \nEcclesiastical Hierarchy\u2019, Pseudo-Dionysius applies this logic to the powers of the church on earth and \nshows how superior and subordinate relationships echo the arrangements of the divine. Here it also \nbecomes clear that the older term \u2018hierarch\u2019, a high priest or leader (etymologically, heiros and arche, or holy \nrule), is being appropriated. Hierarchy is no longer merely about a single charismatic leader, but is a \ngeneralised organizational relation in which we are all embedded, whether we like it or not. \u2018For not \neveryone is holy and, as scripture affirms, knowledge is not for everyone.\u2019 (op cit: 199). \u2018The Ecclesiastical \nHierarchy\u2019 then goes on to describe, in generous detail, the rites and mysteries proper to different roles. \nCertain sorts of people say particular things to other sorts of people in particular places; symbols and \nointment are deployed; and there is some singing at times. The three-fold order of Heirarchs, Priests and \nDeacons is paralleled by different sorts of people seeking purification - catchahumens, possessed and \npenitents. (Though in other places \u2018sacred people\u2019 and monks are added too.) There are clear divisions of \nlabour, and a ranking of beings that allows us to stretch from the dullest catchahumens, who are still being \n\u2018incubated\u2019 by the scriptures, to the divine light, via between fifteen and seventeen orders along the way. \n \nPseudo-Dionysius was not the first, or the last, to propose some sort of vertical ordering of things, and I \nam not proposing him as an origin of all ideas about hierarchy. The notion of the visionary ascending to \nGod, negotiating angelic guardians along the way, can also be found in the Kabbalistic Hekhalot (\u2018Palaces\u2019) \nfrom the 2nd century. Both St Ambrose and St Jerome put forward versions of the angelic order in the \n4th century. St Augustine speculated on the relative places of animals, humans, angels and God at around \nthe same time as Pseudo-Dionysius. Nonetheless, Pseudo-Dionysius was by far the most influential of \nthese writers. In 787, the second Council of Nicea proclaimed an official \u2018Dogma of Archangels\u2019, mostly \nbased on the Corpus Areopagiticum. The earliest Latin translation from the original Greek was made in Paris \nin 838, with a second following a few years later. Yet his real fame and influence coincides with the birth \nof the modern European university in the 12th century (Keck 1998: 50, 75 passim). Urbanization and the \nexpanding professional classes had led to the beginnings of specialised religious institutions to teach \n 6 \ninterpretation, logic and argument. These institutions then became involved in countering various heresies \nand defending doxa with reason. But such deployments of reason also led to an interrogation of the \nmechanisms of His order, through natural philosophy, and the search for legitimation of social orders, \nthrough angelology and hermeneutics6\n \n.  \nAngelology became a way to engage with philosophical debates, and also a method for teaching logic and \ndiscipline. As David Keck put it - \n\u2018Of all God\u2019s creatures, human beings are nearest the angels, and angelology thus promises to \nilluminate anthropology. In the modern world, the impulse to learn about human nature from \nclosely related beings has shifted subjects from seraphim to simians. Whereas modern scientists \nstudy the origins of the apes to uncover clues about humanity, medieval theologians investigated \nangels.\u2019 (1998: 16) \nDuns Scotus suggested that angels were denser than God, and that they could independently think and \nreason. Bonaventure argued that angels were both matter and form. Thomas Aquinas responded by \narguing that angels were entirely form, pure intellect, but that they could inhabit human bodies. Though \nthe question of angels and pinheads comes from a later Rabelaisian parody, it does echo Aquinas\u2019 question \nas to whether two angels could occupy the same space (Marshall and Walsham 2006: 1). Questions \nconcerning the agency, substance and free will of angels were central here, and some serious philosophical \nand social issues were at stake. Should angels be worshipped, or was this itself a heresy? Could good and \nlegitimately constituted authority produce evil?  \n \nThe angelogical shift towards philosophy that we see from the 12th century onwards also supported the \nidea that angels were gradually being withdrawn from the vulgar miracle work that the masses expected \n(and which had so disgusted Pseudo-Dionysius seven centuries previously), and towards higher pursuits. \nHenry Mayr-Harting nicely termed this the \u2018aetherialisation\u2019 of angels (Marshall and Walsham 2006: 8), but \nit also had some concrete political implications. One of the most consistent themes in later angelology is \nthe idea that the hierarchy of heaven echoes the proper hierarchy on earth. Honorius of Autun, \nBonaventure, Bernard of Clairvaux and many others, used these sort of arguments in order to justify a \nwide range of \u2018natural\u2019 orders. All were hierarchically organized - the levels of spiritual enlightenment that \nsomeone must pass through; the relation of man to the natural world; the hierarchy of the church on \nearth; the relation of the church to the state; of Rome to the monastic orders; the organization of \nmonastic orders and so on (Keck 1998: 53 passim). Heresies (whether political or theological) could be put \nin their place by a form of argument that stressed vertical authority and stability. Mobility and monstrosity \nwere immediately classified as illogical (and dangerous) because, as Aquinas put it \u2018no creature of a lower \nnature can ever covet the grade of a higher nature, just as an ass does not desire to be a horse.\u2019 \n \nAny symbolization of movement must be highly controlled, and teleological in nature. Jacob, in Genesis 28, \ndreams of a ladder which reaches to heaven, with (according to Paradise Lost) \u2018angels ascending and \ndescending\u2019. This is an escalator for the messengers, the servants of God, which allows them to visit the \nearth without themselves being changed. Yet there are also versions of movement that imply human \nmobility. In Merkabah mysticism, the pious mortal Enoch so pleased God that he was transformed into \nthe angel Metatron (Astel 2005: 154). Matthew 22 suggests that the fallen angels left vacant thrones that can \nbe occupied by the elect among men. St Francis of Assisi is supposed to have been awarded the throne of \nLucifer himself (Lamborn Wilson 1980: 179). N\u00e9ret even refers to a similar career amongst angels, \nbeginning as singing and dancing cherubs (\u2018chubby aeronauts\u2019), then messengers, then part of the celestial \narmies (2004: 5).  \n \nVisually, from the medieval period onwards, hierarchy became ubiquitous. The soaring front of a \ncathedral, with niches for each rank of being. The illustrations and paintings of near-identical attentive \nupturned faces in linear rows. Ranks of halos painted gold in horizontal lines. See, for example, Fra \nAngelico\u2019s painting \u2018Christ Glorified in Heaven\u2019, from 1423-4. It contains the prophets on the top row, \nthen a row of male martyrs, then (on the bottom row) the female martyrs (Ward and Steeds 2005: 26). Or, \nLorenzo Costa\u2019s \u2018The Adoration of the Shepherds with Archangels\u2019 from c1499, where the full nine \norders, holding associated symbols, are arranged vertically along each edge of the painting (Marshall and \nWalsham 2006: 7). Quite simply, Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019 conception of organization had triumphed. Diego \nLaynez, General of the Jesuits from 1558-1565 expressed the logic in De Hierarchia, on the Divine Origin of \nHierarchy (Quattrone 2004: 647). Since hierarchy means jurisdiction over everything, any authority that \n 7 \nrequires jurisdiction must be hierarchically based. Since A equals B, then all B\u2019s must be A. As above, so \nbelow. God was in His heaven, and all was right with the world. \n \nPopular Orderings \n \nYet, contra Diego Laynez and De Mundo, a hierarchical understanding of organization is not the only one. \nConceptually, hierarchy is a particular species of ordering. The angels have long been implicated in some \nmuch more complex forms of organizing, even though it is true to say that the vertical one became \ndominant after Pseudo-Dionysius. Yet even then, the organization of hierarchy seems to have been \nmutable. Various writers - John of Damascus, Gregory the Great, Isidore of Seville, Bernard of Clairvaux, \nEdmund Spenser, Drummond of Hawthornden - proposed different arrangements of the nine, a different \nnine orders, or even schemas of between seven or twelve orders including \u2018aeons\u2019, \u2018innocents\u2019, \u2018confessors\u2019 \n\u2018flames\u2019, \u2018warriors\u2019, \u2018entities\u2019, \u2018seats\u2019, \u2018hosts\u2019, and \u2018lordships\u2019 (Davidson 1971: 336 passim). And, in case we \nimagine these as merely alterations in the bureaucratic organogram, the 12th century Breviary of St \nHildegard, Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy and Robert Fludd\u2019s History of the Macrocosm (1617) all translate these \norders into Aristolelian concentric circles, or even spheres. For the Jewish mystics there were seven levels \nof heaven - clouds and winds; sinners awaiting judgement; Eden; sun, moon and stars; the fallen angels; \nthe radiant angels; and the archangels and ineffable light (Lamborn Wilson 1980: 74-78). For Dante \nAlighieri, there were nine nested spheres of Paradise, each with its own angel. In the Paradiso VIII, he \nexplicitly acknowledges Pseudo-Dionysius, and his Beatrice is a theophany of the Empyrean light, the light \nof the Primum Mobile.  \n \nBut these vertical or centralising maps were only one of the imaginative topologies. In fact, the angels \nproliferated, both in terms of their different imaginative geographies, and also their connections with the \nday-to-day matters that concerned common people. As noted above, even though Pseudo-Dionysius and \nlater angelologists were keen to draw a line between popular superstition and true enlightenment, the line \nwas impossible to police. So, in angelological writings we have many different versions of the identity of \nthe seven archangels; lists of the ruling princes of the nine celestial orders; of the throne angels; and of the \nsixty four wardens of the seven celestial halls (Davidson 1971). This \u2018internal\u2019 proliferation of categories \nand classifications was related to a dizzying variety of connections between angels and other elements of \nearthly life. There are governing angels of the seasons, of the zodiac, of the months, of the days, the hours \nof the day and night; the intelligences or governors of the seven planets; of the cardinal points on the \nglobe and the altitudes of the globe. Add to this angels that bear mystical names, amulet angels, guardian \nangels, archons and the angels who rule the twenty eight mansions of the moon and we have a panopoly \nof categories. Calvin may have dismissed such writings as \u2018the vain babblings of idle men\u2019 (Davidson 1971: \nxxiii)7\n \n but it did nothing to stop angels being good to think with. \nThis proliferating tendency predates the Corpus Areopagiticum. For example, Enoch 3 (part of the \nPseudepigraphia) identifies \u2018Ram\u2019amiel, who is in charge of thunder; Ra\u2019asiel, who is in charge of \nearhquakes; Shalgiel, who is charge of snow\u2019, and so on. Each ruling prince of the nine angelic hierarchies \nhas particular responsibilities and capacities. There may be seven archangels, but four are above the rest - \nMichael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. Each archangel carries certain things, and is associated with particular \npractices. The seven can also be called the planetary angels (if we delete Uriel but add in Hagiel, Camael, \nZadkiel and Cassiel) and have associations with particular elements, metals, numbers, ancient deities, \nanimals, birds, insects, stones, spices, incense, flowers, trees, foods, healing plants, body parts, bodily \nfunctions, virtues, professions8\n \n, activities and keywords. Or, from Kabbalistic literature, there are ten \ndivine energies (sefirot) each associated with a particular angel. Things and concepts can also have patron \nangels, whilst some emotions or desires have assisting angels. There is even an angel for business ventures \n- Teoael, who happens to be a prince of the Choir of Thrones. In order to get his assistance, write your \npetition on company letterheaded paper, or include a business card (Meville 2001). \nSo the hierarchies seemed to float on the surface of a much more ramified and complex will to classify, \norganize, and order. The angels were not merely \u2018up there\u2019, singing, but \u2018down here\u2019 too. They were in the \nmiddle of things, being (as they are now) attached to things, and becoming part of popular culture, \ncharms, superstitions and curses (Keck 1998). No wonder that the universities and the church needed to \nelevate the angels away from the masses, and to construct a place for everything, and keep everyone in \ntheir place. \n 8 \n \nWar, Surveillance, Seduction \n \nThe entanglements between angelic and human organization were not restricted to a relation between \nchurch doxa and popular heterodoxa. Through the millennium they become manifested in some specific \norganized contexts too. Each positions a relation between a hidden celestial order, and the human. In all \nthree cases which I discuss here, the human is more or less subordinate to the celestial, whether watching, \nbeing watched, or being watchful. \n \nOne of these images is that of the army, which (perhaps since Rome) had been imagined as a hierarchy. \nMilton\u2019s angels are arranged in squadrons, and follow their great commanders (Paradise Lost, Book I). They \nhave fluttering banners and are deployed under their hierarchs. The huge battle that takes place in Book \nVI is a civil war being fought on behalf of mortals. These military and evangelical organizations are \nclashing in a fight in which we are mere onlookers, civilians. Chapter five in Billy Graham\u2019s Angels, \n\u2018Angelic Organization\u2019, runs through what Matthew Henry calls their \u2018offices and employments\u2019. \nArchangel Michael he describes as \u2018the Prime Minister in God\u2019s administration of the universe\u2019 (1976: 54-\n55). The point is that some sort of organization already exists, and it will defend us in the battle against \nevil. \u2018Singly or corporately, angels are for real. They are better organized than were the armies of \nAlexander the Great, Napoleon or Eisenhower.\u2019 (1976: 30) This is the language of an evangelist but, \ndespite all this sound and fury, triumph is guaranteed. \u2018The Bible declares that righteousness will \neventually triumph, Utopia will come to earth, the Kingdom of God will ultimately prevail. In bringing all \nthis about angels will have a prominent part.\u2019 (1976: 127) Such guarantees of victory must be comforting \nfor those who know that they are going to win. Like the seventh cavalry, you know that angels will be \nriding to the rescue. According to some, during the 1914-1918 War, St George and his angels protected \nthe 3rd and 4th Divisions of the British Expeditionary Force from the German First Army during their \nretreat from Mons. During the 1939-46 war, the British Air Chief Marshall Lord Dowding was supposed \nto have claimed that angels flew some planes after the pilots had been killed (Graham 1976: 149). The \ndevil may be \u2018the master-organizer and strategist\u2019 (Graham op cit: 133), but it is certain that triumph and \nvictory will go to the angels, nonetheless. Then, we will be able to rest from our \u2018labours\u2019 and \u2018works\u2019 (op \ncit: 144). But if we are going to win anyway, then why bother with the intervening struggle? Why not sit \nback and enjoy the show? It is probably for this reason that it is more common for mortals to be \nimplicated, the objects of heavenly organization. \n \nOften, rather than being onlookers of a heavenly battle, we are surveilled by the eyes of angels. This \nsecond entanglement is a common trope in films. Powell and Pressburger\u2019s 1946 A Matter of Life and Death \nhad heaven full of well coiffured receptionists in modern offices, and rows of desks. More recently we \nhave seen solemn people in overcoats, looking over our shoulders, listening to our thoughts, or harassed \nmiracle workers on a mission from above. Nabu, the Babylonian winged god of wisdom (who invented \nwriting) used to write down the decisions about humanity\u2019s future each year on the sacred tablets of fate \n(Ward and Steeds 2005: 33). In The Koran, we have the twin hafaza, \u2018recording angels\u2019, one for the day, \nthe good, and one for the night, the bad, who write down your every act in a book that will presented at \nthe day of judgement. In al-Qazwini\u2019s Wonders of Creation from 1208, we can see the angels searching \nthrough the scrolls of human deeds (Lamborn Wilson 1980: 62). These are angelic bureaucrats, consulting \nlists of who is damned and who is saved, as in the orthodox 15th century icon of the last judgement from \nthe Novgorod school (in Ward and Steeds 2005: 48). William Blake drew Metatron as The Recording \nAngel in his illustrations for the Divine Comedy (Astel 2005: 155). Or consider the angel in Byron\u2019s 1822 \nviciously satirical poem \u2018The Vision of Judgment\u2019. Sitting at a black bureau, he had pulled all his wings out \nto make quills to write down the names of the dead during King George III\u2019s reign. Even having a further \nsix angels and twelve saints as clerks didn\u2019t help, since they eventually \u2018threw their pens down in divine \ndisgust\u2019 after Waterloo (lines 16-40). Like Benjamin\u2019s angel of history, they watch, and record. There is no \nintervention, and perhaps even a certain impassive despair. Benjamin\u2019s angel faces the past, and sees \u2018one \nsingle catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet\u2019. At the \nsame time a storm blows from Paradise, pushing the angel of history backwards \u2018into the future to which \nhis back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skywards. This storm is what we call \nprogress.\u2019 (Benjamin 1999: 249)9\n \n. \n 9 \nThe third entanglement with organization makes us active agents in resisting the strategies of the devil. \nHere we are not onlookers or objects, but active participants in a complex conspiracy of temptation and \nfortitude. As Elizabeth Reis (2001) argues, in 17th century Massachusetts, puritans like Cotton Mather and \nhis father Increase Mather (the author of the 1696 Angelographia) were continually on their guard against \nSatan disguising himself as an angel. The Mathers thought that women were particularly vulnerable to the \nblandishments of the devil. They were susceptible to naive belief and weak of will, when what was \nrequired was male strength and moral fibre. Christopher Marlowe\u2019s, rather annoying, good and bad \n\u2018Angells\u2019 in his (c1588-92) Doctor Faustus act to guide, or to tempt. \n\u2018GOOD ANGELL. Sweet Faustus think of heaven and heavenly things \nBAD ANGELL. No Faustus thinks of honour and of wealth\u2019 \n(Act II, scene i) \nPower and sex and money and desire swim before our eyes, even though (we know that) this will be a \nbargain with the devil. Work and the public sphere are the site of many temptations, but those who get \nsucked into them rarely escape, and end up chained to work, whipped by demons. Dante, in canto XXI of \n\u2018L\u2019Inferno\u2019, the first book of The Divine Comedy, summons up the metaphor of the complex labour and \nboiling black pitch used in the Venice Arsenal, the largest form of industrial organization that a 14th \ncentury Florentine would have been aware of. He describes the fifth trench of the eighth circle of hell as \nlike a shipbuilders, just as so many more recent \u2018gothic\u2019 images of work organizations summon dark \ncorridors, fiery furnaces and the endless labours of Sisyphus (H\u00f6pfl 2005, Parker 2005). The good life \nmust be one that escapes the jaws of Mammon, the prince of tempters and demon of avarice. \n\u2018... even in Heaven his looks and thoughts \nWere always downward bent, admiring more \nThe riches of Heaven\u2019s pavement, trodden gold \nThan aught divine or holy\u2019 (Paradise Lost I, 678)10\nNowadays, the temptation is the job offer and dream of career advancement. Jean Lhermitte puts it well in \nhis 1963 True and False Possession \n \n\u2018The Prince of Darkness no longer appears as a personage... but disguises himself willingly, even \npreferably, under the appearance of corporate personalities or institutions.\u2019 (in Davidson 1971: xiv) \nIn Glen Duncan\u2019s novel I, Lucifer, the devil celebrates \u2018systems\u2019, as opposed to individual devilish acts of \ntorture or vandalism. With the system he reminds his fellow fallen angels that evil can achieve \u2018a state \nwhere despair can flourish with barely any interference from us, when they do it to and for themselves, \nwhen that\u2019s the way the world is\u2019 (2002: 145). Then, the inhabitants of hell can lean back and watch, and \nthe angels and the humans will have lost. \n \nAngels Now \n \nContemporary angels seem to have come closer to the human. They are less like soldiers, bureaucrats or \nspies and more like mysterious friends. But, perhaps to avoid accusations of interference and the violation \nof our free will, the angels intervene in minor ways, usually just by delivering messages. The origin of the \nword administration comes from minister, a servant. A ministry was hence a role, responsibility or \nmission, or an institution or person who took on such a mission. The angels minister to human beings, \nthey administer the earth. \n\u2018They superintend the events of your life and protect the interest of Lord God, always working to \npromote his plans to bring about His highest will for you.\u2019 (Graham 1976: 90) \nGraham calls Angelic communication \u2018terse\u2019. They often urge haste, and do so with simple and direct \ncommands (op cit: 116). The angel Moroni told Joseph Smith three times where he could find the tablets of \nThe Book of Mormon. In a dream, Gabriel (Jibra\u2019il) came to Muhammad in the cave of Hira in about 610 \nand told him to \u2018recite!\u2019 three times, and when he awoke, the beginnings of The Koran were inscribed \nupon his heart. Most etymologies of angel involve a reference to the concept or personification of \ncommunication. In Sanskrit angiras means spirit, in Persian angaros means courier. From there we get the \nGreek aggelos and the Latin angelus, both meaning messenger. In Hebrew an angel is mal\u2019ach, from the \nArabic mal\u2019ak, which is in turn from la\u2019aka, to send on a mission.  \n \nIncrease Mather knew that Satan could disguise himself as angel, but he also knew that the world was \nshaped in certain angelic ways (Reis 2001). Angels operated \u2018behind the curtain\u2019, not curing people \nmiraculously, but giving the doctor ideas about how to cure the patient by \u2018insensible manuduction\u2019. \nAngels, he said, \u2018love secrecy in their Administrations\u2019. Reis suggests that 17th century Massachusetts saw \n 10 \na rash of angel sightings which, by the 19th century, were becoming more gentle and feminine in \nappearance.  The fearsome monsters had become putti, cherubic decoration for paintings, and kindly \ncounsellors dressed in white. Popular imagery connected them with innocent children, pre-Raphaelite \nradiance and a sentimental notion of comfort. To a certain extent, this had been prefigured by what David \nKeck calls \u2018the Christianization of fortune\u2019 during the medieval period (1998: 161-3), an echo of Mayr-\nHarting\u2019s \u2018aetherialisation\u2019. The culture of the people invoked angels as everyday charms and spells, whilst \nat the same time the angelologists attempted to legitimate them as categories for interrogating the divine. \nBut the popular ordering of fetishes becomes a threat to those that elevate celestial and intellectual \nhierarchies. Even Pseudo-Dionysius himself had complained about the vulgar understandings of his 5th \ncentury populus. \n \u2018High-flown shapes could well mislead someone into thinking that the heavenly beings are golden \nor gleaming men, glamorous, wearing lustrous clothing, giving off flames which cause no harm...\u2019 \n(in Luibheid 1987: 150) \nAngels were ideas, not things, and he dismissed \u2018the sheer crassness of the signs\u2019 which showed that too \nmany human beings were willing \u2018to be lazily satisfied by base images\u2019 (op cit).  \n \nIt would seem that condemnations of popular angel worship are not at all new, and indeed that the angels \nof the New Age are not that new either. Nowadays, the shelves of bookshops and the pages of the \ninternet have plenty of angels, often combining in remarkable ways with crystals, Native American spirit \nguides, and cultural bric-a-brac from any place and time. These angels leave messages in dreams, they heal, \nwarn, or appear on slippery corners in the middle of rainstorms. They encourage us to treat everyone we \nmeet as if they were an angel, and to notice when we see a single white feather left rocking in the breeze. \nOr, on \u2018World Angel Day\u2019 to \u2018work harmoniously alongside them in their mission to heal the planet\u2019 (Astel \n2005: 73). Sharon Linn\u00e9a, who was a contributing editor to Angels on Earth magazine, suggests various \ntheories that might explain an intensification of angelic activity now (Beliefnet 2003: 10-11). Angels might \nbe busier now than they were, which suggests that their activity might go in cycles. That in turn might be \nbecause science is revealing cosmic and microscopic mysteries that drive humans to seek further \nexplanations. Or, perhaps we are becoming more receptive to the quiet voices, the messages left that we \nare often too busy to notice. Or, it might be simply because there is so much evil in the world now that we \nare seeking help and guidance in order to resist the temptations of the flesh and the violence of \nhumankind. \n \nLinn\u00e9a might be right. In a world of Business Schools and Business Angels, Hells Angels and AGM 114L \nHellfire air to ground missiles, perhaps we do need angels more than ever (Lange 1998). Perhaps when we \nsee the angels \u2018fleeing with tattered wings before the outrages of modern art\u2019 (N\u00e9ret 2004: 6)11 some \npeople feel the need to call these nineteenth century creatures back. These are not the avenging monsters \nof old, with thousands of eyes and voices like crowds. Like lucky heather or a rabbit\u2019s foot, they whistle in \nthe wind for us, asking fate to protect us from evil. These are creatures of an age dominated by romantic \nand therapeutic conceptions of the human, but endlessly threatened by the impersonal violence of the \nurban, the commercial and the realistic. Edward Burne-Jones put it well when, in a letter to Oscar Wilde, \nhe wrote \u2018the more materialistic science becomes, the more angels shall I paint\u2019 (Graham 1976: 9)12\n \n. \nHard Liberty, or Servile Pomp \n \nThe metaphors of angelic organization shift to fit the time of their origin. So lets finish with one more. In \nthis, most abstracted, sense of angelic organization it becomes a verb. As St Augustine put it \u2018angelus est \nnomen officii\u2019, \u2018angel is the name of the office\u2019. It is a function, a movement, a transmission. Not something \nthat we humans merely watch, or that merely watches us, or that we have any agency over, but a way of \ndescribing our entanglement in the movements of the world. In the breath of wind, a half heard whisper, \nthe chance meeting, the ordering and organizing that just happens in us and around us. For Aquinas, these \nwere \u2018powers\u2019 and \u2018immaterial spirits\u2019, \u2018a succession of contacts of power at diverse places\u2019, in time but not \nin a necessary location. Angels were pure agency, and the question was not \u2018What is an Angel?\u2019 but \u2018What \ndoes an Angel Do?\u2019 (Lamborn Wilson 1980: 49). Eight centuries later this is echoed by Michel Serres, a \ncontemporary angelologist at a Parisian university, in his essay on interchangers, intermediaries, and \nexchange between networks. He describes airports as full of \u2018angels of steel, carrying angels of flesh and \nblood, who in turn send angel signals across angel air waves\u2019 (1995: 8) The world is a general message \nbearing system, and \u2018angel\u2019 is the name for that part of it that is more mobile than the rest. Or Massimo \n 11 \nCacciari, a contemporary neo-Platonist who wishes us to see angels as that which always escapes \nexpression, of the \u2018idea in the name\u2019 (1994: 48). Of that which escapes from language, but is always \nnecessary for language to begin - a kind of utopian no-place which is always imaginary and which propels \ncommunication. \n \nIn some rather obvious ways, this takes us back to Pseudo-Dionysius. His world was a connected one too, \none in which the divine light, angels, human beings and beasts were all a part. His solution to the problem \nof wholes and parts was that they must be arranged hierarchically. This is not the only solution to his \nproblem. Serres prefers the idea of a network of actants, and Cacciari the mobility and mutability of \npoststructuralism. All three are modes of organizing, yet the angelic hierarchies are the only ones that can \nand have been used to justify the proto-bureaucratic life. Serres makes this particularly clear. For him, the \nmessenger should disappear once the message is delivered. Who can tell the message from the messenger? \nIn a network, or in a language for that matter, the two are one. This means that the humble intermediary \nmust always dematerialise, and not get sucked into becoming a self-important machine for manufacturing \nstable myths (1995: 105) In Serres\u2019 network of interchangers - \n\u201c\u2018... All hierarchy collapses.\u2019 \n\u2018And at that point, the machine for fabricating gods (the machine which also produces violence and \nwar) comes to a standstill.\u2019\u201d \n (1995: 290) \n \nYet most of the time angels are known for their obedience, satisfaction with a place in the order of things, \npiety and chastity (Keck 1998: 118). Angels tend to represent order amidst disorder, the pattern behind \nthe chaos, and a guarantee of the status quo. In his The Vision of Judgment Byron claims, \u2018for by many \nstories, and true, we learn the Angels are all Tories\u2019 (line 206-7). Byron sees them as on the side of \nconservatism, recording the outrages of power, and washing their hands of any guilt or complicity. During \nthe long hours of monastic and ecclesiastical lives they sing in unison for harmony, unitarism, living \naccording to the rule, and duty, without wild hatreds or passions. Even Billy Graham seems to be a little \nimpatient with their coolness. He claims Biblical authority for the idea that man is in a \u2018temporary lower \nposition\u2019 than angels, which will be amended once the Kingdom of God has come in its fullness. Man was \nmade higher than the animals, and angels have been commanded to help us because we will be higher than \nthem after the resurrection (1976: 43) \u2018Someday man will be as perfect as angels are now\u2019 (op cit: 47). Man \nstruggles, and will experience salvation, faith and God, and hence have an experience that angels can never \npossess, but \u2018no angel can be an evangelist\u2019 (Graham 1976: 106). Even if we might not agree with Graham \nthat he is better than the angels, we can recognise his irritation at their condescension. In Theodore \nSturgeon\u2019s short story \u2018It Opens the Sky\u2019, their composure becomes deeply annoying. Angels are \nsanctimonious creatures who \u2018Just went around smiling and being helpful and reminding people to be \nkind to one another.\u2019 (1970: 112) When they look at you with those big, open, compassionate eyes, they \ndeserve a punch. \n \nThe really terrible thing about all this, the thing that makes you want to shake them, is that they were \noffered a choice. According to Aquinas, at the moment of their creation, all the angels were offered \nliberty. Two thirds chose to become servants of God and to sing praise to Him until the end of their days. \nBeings with wings that gave them the freedom to become a bird - to soar over the earth, looping the loop \nand becoming part of networks, multitudes, alternatives - chose to become servants. One third chose \nfreedom - \n\u2018...preferring \nHard liberty before the easy yoke \nOf servile pomp.\u2019 (Milton Paradise Lost  II, 255-57) \nOnce Lucifer and the others had made their choice, had chosen will and the overthrowing of established \norder, there was no way back to the \u2018tyranny of heaven\u2019. \n\u2018Suppose He should relent \nAnd publish grace to all, on promise made \nOf new subjection; with what eyes could we  \nStand in His presence humble, and receive \nStrict laws imposed, to celebrate His throne \nWith warbled hymns, and to His Godhead sing \nForced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits \n 12 \nOur envied sovereign, and his altar breathes \nAmbrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, \nOur servile offerings?\u2019 (II, 237-46) \n \nOf course, the hierarchical angels reply that Satan is proud, and bent on our destruction. In the Koran, \nIblis (Satan) refuses to bow before a being made from clay. On his banishment, he tells the creator that he \nwill deceive and exterminate these low creatures. Such refusal to bow when told to is jealousy, arrogance, \nand even (in a pre-Foucauldian twist) a further form of slavery. \n\u2018This is servitude: \nTo serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled \nAgainst his worthier - as thine now serve thee, \nThyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;\u2019 (VI, 179-181) \nBut they would say that, wouldn\u2019t they? To justify their place in the order of things, and avoid \u2018His wrath, \nwhich He calls justice\u2019 (Book II, l733). Because the hierarchical angels are Tories, advocates for secular \nand celestial sclerosis, for the great chain of being and the order of things. The point of hierarchy is to \nstop movement, or at the very least slow it and make it predictable. It is to chain the universe with \nsomething that ties all being together, and ensures that the only movement is that which is already \ndetermined at the moment of creation by the first mover. No wonder the popular and polymorphous \nangels were treated with suspicion, and why Serres\u2019 and Cacciari\u2019s angels are endless movements, not \nobedient employees. Glen Duncan\u2019s Lucifer understands this problem in a way that Pseudo-Dionysius \nnever could - \u2018for an angel there is only one true freedom, and that, I\u2019m honestly sad to say, is freedom \nfrom God.\u2019 (2002: 210). \n \nThe precondition for freedom is a consciousness that things could be otherwise. The myth of the \nAreopagite, in its incarnations of stone, paint and institution, tells us that things are eternally the same. \nPseudo-Dionysius is not the sole origin of this version of organization, though certainly an important \nrelay, but his version of angelic organization has spent a millennium struggling with the popular angels. In \nmy view, this struggle is still continuing, even though the ontology of angels is no longer the central \nterrain, and it is now Western managerialism, as well as many churches, attempting to hold the high \nground. Unsuprisingly, those who benefit from hierarchy are busy naturalising it, and claiming some sort \nof inevitability to the function, cadre and discipline of management that supports it. This paper has sought \nto historicise one of the foundations of this account, and hence begin to de-naturalise hierarchy, in the \nsense of proving its contingency. There are other accounts and practices of organization that assume that \nhierarchy is not inevitable \u2013 anarchism, feminism, forms of environmentalism and communitarianism \n(Marshall 1993, Feree and Martin 1995, Naess 1989, Lovink and Scholz 2007). There are histories of \nrebellion and popular orderings, a multitude of intentional communities, and many, many utopias that \nimagine worlds in which power is not concentrated at the top of a chain of beings (Parker 2002b, Parker, \nFournier and Reedy 2007). There is not one alternative to Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s cosmology, but many.  \n \nIn Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, there is a type of person who \u2018rather than live in wretched poverty at home, \nvolunteers for slavery in Utopia.\u2019 (1965: 102). That is what organization means to them. A steady job, \nshops with food in them, and a police force that enforces the law. This has its attractions, and anyone who \nstudies organization will understand the importance of certain sorts of predictability. Lucifer would rather \n\u2018reign in hell than serve in heaven\u2019 (I, 263). That is what angelic organization means to him. It means \npreferring disobedience to the boredom of condescending angels, to the inevitability of hierarchy, the \nasymmetry of power, and the machine that endlessly manufactures false Gods. As Kurt Vonnegut \nbeautifully observes, there is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil, and the triumph of \nanything is a matter of organization. So organization is not one thing, whatever \u2018the most Holy \nHierotheus\u2019 might claim. \n \nReferences \n \nAppleyard, Brian 2006 Aliens.

Also thanks to Simon Bainbridge, Anders Bojesen, Chris Erskine, Valerie Fournier, \nDamian O\u2019Doherty, Brenda Parker, Sverre Spoelstra, Jeroen Veldman and the reviewers and \neditors of OS. \n2 In A.S. Byatt\u2019s Angels and Insects, one of the characters suggests that angels would need a \nbreastbone protruding by several feet to counterbalance the wings, and another remembers her \nbrother commenting that \u2018angels are only a clumsy form of poultry\u2019 (1993: 202). My colleague \nPeter Armstrong calculated that the average angel would have a wing loading of about 35ib per \nsquare foot, about the same as a WW2 Spitfire. This would require a takeoff speed of about 110 \nmph, which means they would have to be able to run quite quickly. \n3 I will follow convention here, and assume that God is a male, and that he is insecure enough to \ndemand capitalisation. The two assumptions may be related. \n4 Just why God needed to set representation going is unclear. Some accounts might suggest that \nhe wanted to be known, others that he was simply an insecure control freak who desired undilted \nadultation, ad nauseum, ad infinitum. That\u2019s why he filled the universe with \u2018301, 655, 722 \nextramundane brown-nosers for - He\u2019s - a - jolly - good - fellowing Him in deafening celestial \nharmony\u2019 (Duncan 2002: 9) \n5 I am not alone in mentioning Pseudo-Dionysius here. See Burrell 1997: 68, and particularly \nKornberger et al 2006, both also attempts to historicise the theory of organizations. \n6 And, perhaps, a few centuries later, to Cartesian ideas about a hierarchy of knowing through \nreason which would be capable of resisting the mystifications of an evil demon, and placing man \nin relation to the natural world (Jones 2006). \n7 It is worth noting that the classifications of demons in demonology are just as complex. \nMediaeval \u2018Grimoires\u2019, such as that written by Bishop Pierre Binsfield, often contain descriptions \n 15 \n                                                                                                                                                        \nof demons of each deadly sin, of different layers of the earth and air, of hierarchies, of months, of \ndifferent forms and so on. \n8 For academics and writers, the angel is probably Raphael, who represents communication and \nscience. You are also encouraged to eat celery, and pay attention to the number eight, and \nmonkeys. \n9 Though, as Maeseneer points out, the function of Benjamin\u2019s angel is ambivalent. He may \nhave begun with the notion that the angel symbolised the necessary violence of revolution, an \nangel of destruction (2003a: 513-6), which later mutates into an angel of witness (2003b: \n378). \n10 In De Plancy\u2019s Dictionnaire Infernal (1825-6), Mammon is said to be hell\u2019s ambassador to \nEngland, the most industrialised country in the world at the time (Davidson 1971: 182). \n11 Compare the antique angels in N\u00e9ret 2004 with the contemporary devils in N\u00e9ret 2003 for \nsome proof of this. \n12 It is worth noting that (in addition to the ape) another figure enters the picture here too, the \nalien. What Maeseneer calls the \u2018phantasmagoric anthropology\u2019 (2003b: 383) that sustained \nangelology has, to some extent, relocated to UFOlogy. See Appleyard 2006.  \n"}
