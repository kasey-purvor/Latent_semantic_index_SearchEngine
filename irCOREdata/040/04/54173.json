INTRODUCTION \nLTHOUGH it is more difficult for rational IIR filters to \nhave linear phase frequency responses when compared to \nthat for finite impulse response (FIR) filters, costs for \nimplementing the rational IIR filters are usually lower than \nthat for the FIR filters at given passband and stopband \nspecifications. Hence, rational IIR filters are preferred in \nmany industrial and engineering applications in which phase \nresponses are not very important [1]-[3]. In particular, in a \nsigma delta modulator, it consists of a discrete-time filter. \nSince a sigma delta modulator is operated in an oversampling \nmanner, a narrow band filter is required. As a result, a rational \nIIR filter is preferred because the cost for employing an FIR \nfilter is too high. Due to the quantization process, the phase \ninformation is seriously corrupted by the quantizer. Hence, the \nphase information cannot be exploited and it is not very \nimportant for the design of a sigma delta modulator. \nOne of the most common methods for designing rational \nIIR filters is via eigenfilter approaches [4]-[8], in which \noptimal solutions can be found by computing the eigenvalues \nof the error matrices. Another method is via a WISE approach \n[19]. An optimal solution can be found by computing a \ngradient of the corresponding cost function. A model \nmatching approach [17] was also proposed. This method is to \nmodel rational IIR filters as FIR filters and then minimized the \ndifference between a norm of these two classes of filters. \nHowever, since all these methods [4]-[8], [17], [19] are based \non formulating their design problems as unconstrained \noptimization problems, the stability, as well as the size of the \nripple magnitudes in passbands and stopbands of the filters, \nare not guaranteed. Moreover, they required phase \ninformation for the desired filter responses. In some \napplications, such as the applications in sigma delta \nmodulators [1], phase responses are not very important. \nImposing extra phase information on desired filter responses \nmay cause degradation on filter performances. \nIn order to tackle parts of these issues, rational IIR filter \ndesign problems are formulated as constrained optimization \nproblems subject to various constraints. These optimization \nproblems are solved via the Gauss-Newton method [18]. \nHowever, this method replied on smooth cost functions and is \neasy to trap at local minima because these optimization \nproblems are not convex. In order to avoid computing the \ngradients of cost functions, these design problems are \nformulated as constrained iterative design problems [9]-[16]. \nFilter coefficients are designed based on initialized \ndenominator coefficients and the iteration of the design \nprocess until the denominator coefficients converged. Since \nthese approaches required an initialization of denominator \ncoefficients, the global optimal solutions, as well as the \nconvergence of the iterative process, are not guaranteed. \nThere were some other methods proposed for designing \nrational IIR filters, such as via half band filters [20]. However, \nthis approach is not applied if filters are not halfband ones. \nAnother method based on controlling frequency response of \nfilters continuously was proposed [21]. As it is a kind of \nadaptive filter design techniques, the filters are time-varying. \nIf only the magnitude response of rational IIR filters is \ndesigned, then we can formulate the design problems as \noptimization problems. The cost of the corresponding \noptimization problems can be defined as the total weighted \nabsolute error in the passbands and stopbands of the filters, in \nwhich the error function reflects the ripple square magnitudes, \nsubject to constraints based on the specification on this \nweighted absolute error function in the corresponding \npassbands and stopbands, as well as to a stability condition of \nthe filters. However, this kind of optimization problem is \ndifficult to solve because it involves a nonsmooth nonconvex \nOptimal Design of Magnitude Responses of \nRational Infinite Impulse Response Filters \nCharlotte Yuk-Fan Ho P1 P, Student Member, IEEE, Bingo Wing-Kuen LingP2 P, Yan-Qun Liu P3 P, Peter \nKwong-Shun TamP4 P, Member, IEEE, and Kok-Lay TeoP5 P, Senior Member, IEEE \nA \nT-SP-03326-2005.R2 \n \n \n2\n2\ncost and continuous functional constraints. \nTo solve the optimization problems with continuous \nfunctional constraints, one may sample these continuous \nfunctional constraints and convert to finite discrete constraints \n[14], [22]. However, it is not guaranteed that solutions \nobtained satisfy the original continuous functional constraints. \nAlthough the difference between the exact upper bounds of \ndiscretized constraint functions and that of the corresponding \ncontinuous functional constraint functions decrease as the \nnumber of grid points increases, the computational complexity \nincreases. To find the global optimal solution of nonconvex \nproblems, one may apply the bridging method [23]. However, \nthis method is applied only for one-dimensional optimization \nproblems. \nIn this paper, a magnitude design of rational IIR filters is \nformulated as a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem \nwith continuous functional constraints. Our previous proposed \nconstraint transcription method [24] is applied to transform \nthese continuous functional constraints to equality constraints. \nThe global optimal solution can be obtained via the hybrid \nglobal optimization method [25]. The obtained numerical \nexperiments show that very small transition bandwidth filters \ncan be obtained. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows. The problem \nformulation is presented in Section II. The numerical \nexperiments are shown in Section III. Finally, a conclusion is \nsummarized in Section IV. \nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION \nConsider a general rational IIR filter with frequency \nresponse \n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212\n+\n= N\nn\njn\nn\nM\nm\njm\nm\njD\nea\nebe\nH\n1\n0\n1\n)(\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9 , (1) \nwhere 1\u2212\u2261j , D  relates to the delay of the filter, M  and N  \nare, respectively, the number of non-zero roots of the \npolynomials of \u03c9je\u2212  in the numerator and denominator, mb  for \nMm ,,1,0 L=  and na  for Nn ,,2,1 L=  are, respectively, the \nfilter coefficients in the numerator and denominator. Solving \nthe optimal filter design problem is equivalent to determine \nthe values of na  for Nn ,,2,1 L=  and mb  for Mm ,,1,0 L= . It \nis worth noting that \u211c\u2208D  is not important for the magnitude \ndesign problem, where \u211c  denotes the set of all real numbers. \nHere, we only consider filters with real coefficients, which are \nthe most usual cases in most applications [1]-[3]. So \n\u211c\u2208,, mn ba  for Nn ,,2,1 L=  and Mm ,,1,0 L= . It is worth \nnoting that both the causal and noncausal filters can be \ndesigned via the following approach. That means, M  can be \ngreater than, equal or less than N , D  can be positive, zero or \nnegative numbers, and not necessary to be an integer. \nLet the desired magnitude response of )(\u03c9H  be ( )\u03c9H~ , \nwhere ( ) 0~ \u2265\u03c9H  [ ]\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9 ,\u2212\u2208\u2200 .

There are many ways to formulate an error function. \nFor example, we can formulate an error function as follows: \n( )\n2\n10\n1~)( \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212\u2261 \u2211\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212 N\nn\njn\nn\nM\nm\njm\nm\njD eaHebeE \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 . (3) \nHowever, this function is not differentiable with respect to the \nfilter coefficients. For example, consider a second order \nrational IIR filter with 0=D , -30 1017630352.81633570 \u00d7=b , \n-3\n1 1045086621.87755713 \u00d7=b  and \n-3\n2 1017630632.81633570 \u00d7=b . The plot of )(\u03c9E  against \n( )21, aa  at 0=\u03c9  is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from the \nfigure that )0(E  is not differentiable along the line \n0121 =++ aa . Besides, since this error function consists of \ntaking the modulus operators inside the square operator, there \ndoes not exist any method for solving this kind of nonsmooth \nproblem. Although there are some alternative methods to \ndefine the error function so that the error function is smooth, \nfor example, \n( )\n22\n1\n2\n0\n1~)( \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212\u2261 \u2211\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212 N\nn\njn\nn\nM\nm\njm\nm\njD eaHebeE \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 , \nthe error function is fourth order, and many local minima and \nmaxima would be occurred. In order to tackle this issue, we \nredefine )(\u03c9E  as follows: \n( )( ) 2\n1\n2\n2\n0\n1~)( \u2211\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212 +\u2212\u2261\nN\nn\njn\nn\nM\nm\njm\nm\njD eaHebeE \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9\u03c9 . (4) \nIn this case, )(\u03c9E  is differentiable with respect to the filter \ncoefficients. Let the filter coefficients in the numerator and \ndenominator be, respectively, \n[ ]TMn bbb ,,, 10 L\u2261x  (5) \nand \n[ ]TNd aaa ,,, 21 L\u2261x , (6) \nwhere the superscript T  denotes the transpose. Define [ ]TjMjn ee \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212\u2212\u2261 ,,,1)( L\u03b7  (7) \nand [ ]TjNjjd eee \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2261 ,,,)( 2 L\u03b7 , (8) \nthen \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) 222 )(1~)()( dTdnTn HE x\u03b7x\u03b7 \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 +\u2212= . (9) \nDenote the passband and stopband of the filter be, \nrespectively, PB  and SB . In order to design a rational IIR filter \nhaving good frequency selectivity, total ripple energy in both \nthe passband and stopband of the filter should be minimized. \nHence, we define a cost function as follows: \n( ) ( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndn dEWJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9)(,~ xx , (10) \nT-SP-03326-2005.R2 \n \n \n3\n3\nwhere 0)( >\u03c9W  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  is a weighting function. This \ncost function can represent the total weighted absolute ripple \nsquare magnitude in the passband and stopband of the filter \nbecause ( )\u03c9E  represents the absolute ripple square \nmagnitude. It is worth noting that ( )\u03c9E  is still a nonsmooth \nfunction. However, since the modulus operator is taken \noutside a smooth function, this kind of optimization problem \ncan be solved via the constraint transcription method [24] and \nwill be discussed below. \nAlthough the cost function can be used to minimize the \ntotal weighted absolute ripple square magnitude in the \npassband and stopband of the filter, there may have a very \nserious overshoot. Hence, a specification based on the \nweighted absolute ripple square magnitude is defined as \nfollows: \n( ) ( )\u03c9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c9 ~)(~ \u2264EW  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , (11a) \nwhere 0)(~ >\u03c9W  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  is a weighting function and \n0)(~ >\u03c9\u03b4  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  relates to the allowable weighted \nabsolute ripple square magnitude in both the passband and \nstopband of the filter. This constraint is equivalent to: \n( ) ( )\u03c9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c9 ~)(~ \u2264EW  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  (11b) \nand \n( ) ( )\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03b4 EW )(~~ \u2264\u2212  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 . (11c) \nIn order to guarantee that the designed filter is stable, we \nneed to satisfy the following condition: \n( )( ) 0)(1Re <+ dTd x\u03b7 \u03c9  [ ]\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9 ,\u2212\u2208\u2200 . (12) \nHence, the rational IIR filter design problem can be \nformulated as the following optimization problem: \nProblem ( P~ ) \n( )dn xx ,min\n ( ) ( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndn dEWJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9)(,~ xx , (13a) \nsubject to ( ) ( ) ( ) 0~)(~,,~1 \u2264\u2212\u2261 \u03c9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 EWg dn xx  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 ,(13b) \n ( ) ( ) ( ) 0~)(~,,~2 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261 \u03c9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 EWg dn xx  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 ,(13c) \n ( ) ( )( ) 0)(1Re,~3 \u2264+\u2261 dTddg x\u03b7x \u03c9\u03c9  [ ]\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9 ,\u2212\u2208\u2200 . (13d) \nIt is worth noting that problem P~  consists of a nonsmooth \nnonconvex cost and continuous functional constraints. This \nkind of optimization problem is difficult to solve. In order to \ntackle this issue, our proposed constraint transcription method \n[24] is applied to convert these continuous functional \nconstraints to equality constraints and discussed as follows. \nSince \n( ){ } ( )( )\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n>\n\u2264=\n0,,~ valuepositive\n0,,~0\n0,,,~max\n1\n1\n1 \u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\ndn\ndn\ndn g\ng\ng\nxx\nxx\nxx , (14) \nby defining \n( ){ }( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndndn dgg\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9 211 0,,,~max),(\u02c6 xxxx , (15) \nthen we have: \n( )\n( )\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n>\u2208\u2203\n\u2264\u2208\u2200=\n0,,~, valuepositive\n0,,~,0\n),(\u02c6\n1\n1\n1 \u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\ndnSP\ndnSP\ndn gBB\ngBB\ng\nxx\nxx\nxx U\nU .

(24) \nAs ),(\u02c61 dng xx , ),(\u02c62 dng xx  and )(\u02c63 dg x  are continuously \ndifferentiable with respect to ),( dn xx  and dx , respectively, \nthe optimization problem P~  is equivalent to the following \noptimization problem, denoted as problem P: \nProblem (P) \n( )dn xx ,min\n ( ) ( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndn dEWJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9)(,~ xx , (25a) \nsubject to 0),(\u02c61 =dng xx , (25b) \n 0),(\u02c6 2 =dng xx , (25c) \n 0)(\u02c63 =dg x . (25d) \nHowever, problem P is still a nonsmooth nonconvex \nproblem, where the nonsmooth function appears in the cost. \nThus, standard optimization software packages, such as \nMatlab Optimization toolbox, in theory, cannot be applied \ndirectly. To overcome this difficulty, the nonsmooth absolute \nfunction ( )\u03c9E  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  is handled in the following \nmanner. SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  and 0>\u03b5 , consider the following \nfunction: \nT-SP-03326-2005.R2 \n \n \n4\n4\n( ) ( )\n( )( ) ( )\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n<+\n\u2265\n\u2261\n24\n2)( 2 \u03b5\u03c9\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03c9\n\u03b5\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03b5\nEE\nEE\nE . (26) \nClearly, the function )(\u03c9\u03b5E  possesses the following \nproperties: \ni) SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , )(\u03c9\u03b5E  is continuously differentiable \nwith respect to ),( dn xx . \nii) ),( dn xx\u2200  and SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , ( )\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5 EE \u2265)( . \niii) ),( dn xx\u2200  and SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , ( )\n4\n)( \u03b5\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5 \u2264\u2212 EE . \niv) ),( dn xx\u2200 , ),( \u2217\u2217 dn xx  minimizes ( )\u03c9E  if and only if it \nminimizes )(\u03c9\u03b5E . \nBy virtue of these properties, )(\u03c9\u03b5E  is an ideal approximation \nof the nonsmooth function ( )\u03c9E . By replacing )(\u03c9\u03b5E  for \n( )\u03c9E  in the cost function (25a), we obtain \n( ) ( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndn dEWJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u03b5\u03b5 )(, xx , (27) \nwhere the function ( )dnJ xx ,\u03b5  is now continuously \ndifferentiable with respect to ),( dn xx  0>\u2200\u03b5 . Hence, we can \napproximate the nonsmooth optimization problem P by a \nsmooth optimization problem, where the cost function (27) is \nto be minimized subject to the equality constraints defined in \n(25b), (25c) and (25d). Let this optimization problem be \nreferred to as problem \u03b5Q  as follows: \nProblem ( \u03b5Q ) \n( )dn xx ,min\n ( ) ( )\u222b\u2261\nSP BB\ndn dEWJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 \u03b5\u03b5 )(, xx , (28a) \nsubject to 0),(\u02c61 =dng xx , (28b) \n 0),(\u02c6 2 =dng xx , (28c) \n 0)(\u02c63 =dg x . (28d) \n0>\u2200\u03b5 , let ),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  be an optimal solution to the \napproximate problem \u03b5Q . Furthermore, let ),(\n\u2217\u2217\ndn xx  be an \noptimal solution to the original problem P. Then, there are two \nquestions to be answered. First, how much does ),( ,,\n\u2217\u2217\ndnJ \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 xx  \ndiffer from ),(~ \u2217\u2217 dnJ xx ? Second, what is the relationship \nbetween { }),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  and { }),( \u2217\u2217 dn xx ? To address the first \nquestion, we have the following theorem: \nTheorem 1 \nLet ),( ,,\n\u2217\u2217\ndn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  and ),(\n\u2217\u2217\ndn xx  be, respectively, optimal \nsolutions to problems \u03b5Q  and P. Then \n( )\u222b\u2264\u2212\u2264 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\nSP BB\ndndn dWJJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 4),(\n~),(0 ,, xxxx . \nProof \nBy virtue of property (ii) of the function )(\u03c9\u03b5E , we have \n( ) ( ) ( )\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 =\u2265\u2265 dndndndn JJJJ dn xxxxxxxx xx ,~,~min),(~),( ,,,,, \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 . (29) \nHence, ( ) 0,~),( ,, \u2265\u2212 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 dndn JJ xxxx \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 . (30) \nNext, from property (iii) of the function )(\u03c9\u03b5E , we have \n( ) ( ) ( )\u222b\u2264\u2212\u2264 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\nSP BB\ndndn dWJJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5\u03b5 4,\n~,0 xxxx . (31) \nBut ( ) ( )\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2264 dndn JJ xxxx ,, ,, \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 , (32) \nso we have \n( ) ( ) ( )\u222b\u2264\u2212 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\nSP BB\ndndn dWJJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 4,\n~, ,, xxxx . (33) \nHence, this completes the proof. \u0084 \nTo address the second question, we have the following \ntheorem: \nTheorem 2 \nLet { }),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  be a sequence of optimal solutions to the \ncorresponding sequence of approximate problems { }\u03b5Q . Then \nan accumulation point exists and it is an optimal solution to \nthe original problem P. \nProof \nSince ( )dnJ xx ,\u03b5  is continuous with respect to both ),( dn xx  \nand \u03b5 , { }),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  is a convergent sequence and there exists \nan accumulation point ),( dn xx  and a subsequence of the \nsequence { }),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx , which is again denoted by the original \nsequence, such that 0),(),( ,, \u2192\u2212\u2217\u2217 dndn xxxx \u03b5\u03b5  as 0\u2192\u03b5 , \nwhere \u22c5  denotes the Euclidean norm. By Theorem 1, as \n( )\u222b\u2264\u2212\u2264 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\nSP BB\ndndn dWJJ\nU\n\u03c9\u03c9\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 4),(\n~),(0 ,, xxxx , we have \n),(~),( ,,\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2192 dndn JJ xxxx \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5  as 0\u2192\u03b5 . Hence, this completes the \nproof. \u0084 \nBased on these two theorems, problem P~  can be solved via \nsolving a sequence of approximate problems { }\u03b5Q  by an \niterative technique stated in [24] with decreasing value of \u03b5  \nand the algorithm is summarized as follows: \nAlgorithm 1 \nStep 0: Initialize 01 >\u03b5  and 1=k . \nStep 1: Solve problem \nk\u03b5Q  by hybrid global optimization \nmethod discussed in [25]. Denote the solution by \n),( ,,\n\u2217\u2217\ndn kk \u03b5\u03b5 xx . \nStep 2: Set \nL\nk\nk\n\u03b5\u03b5 =+1 , where 1>L  is a prespecified number. \nStep 3: If \u03b2\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 \u2264\u2212 \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2212 ),(),( ,,,, 11 dndn kkkk xxxx , where 0>\u03b2  is a \nprescribed small number depending on the accuracy \ndesired, then stop. Otherwise, set 1+= kk  and go to \nStep 1. \nIn Algorithm 1, we can see that 0\u2192k\u03b5  as +\u221e\u2192k  because \n1>L . Hence, according to Theorem 2, we can see that the \nsolution obtained { }),( ,, \u2217\u2217 dn \u03b5\u03b5 xx  converges to the global optimal \nT-SP-03326-2005.R2 \n \n \n5\n5\nsolution of problem P. \nThere are three parameters in the Algorithm 1, namely, 1\u03b5 , \nL  and \u03b2 . 1\u03b5  determines how close the approximate problem \n1\u03b5Q  and the original problem P. The smaller the value of 1\u03b5 , \nthe more close will be the problem \n1\u03b5Q  to problem P, and \nhence less number of iterations of Algorithm 1 is required. \nHowever, the cost function becomes less smooth. L  also \ndetermines the number of iterations required. Similarly, the \nlarger the value of L , the less number of iterations is required, \nbut the cost function becomes less smooth even for small \nvalues of k . Practically, we find that if 31 10\n\u2212\u2248\u03b5  and 10\u2248L , \nthen the number of iterations required and the cost function \nwill be, respectively, small and smooth enough for most \noptimization problems [24]. \u03b2  controls the acceptable \nprecision of the obtained solution. The smaller the value of \n\u03b2 , the more accurate of the solution is. However, the number \nof iterations required increases. Due to practical reasons, such \nas finite number of bits for representing filter coefficients, if \n610 \u2212\u2248\u03b2 , then the obtained solution will be good for most \napplications [1]-[3]. \nIt is worth noting that problem \nk\u03b5Q  is a nonconvex \nproblem, so global optimal solution will not be guaranteed if it \nis solved via the existing gradient approach method [18]. In \norder to solve this difficulty, the hybrid global optimization \nmethod is applied [25] and is summarized as follows: The \nhybrid global optimization method consists of two basic \ncomponents: local optimizers and feasible point finders. Given \na feasible point, local optimizers will quickly produce a local \noptimal solution in the neighborhood of the feasible point. For \nthe feasible point finders, first, choose an initial point ( )oo dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  from the feasible set of the problem k\u03b5Q  and start \nthe local optimizer. Assume that the local optimizer has \nproduced the local optimal solution of ( )dnkJ xx ,\u03b5  near ( )oo dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx . Denote the local optimal solution and the \ncorresponding local optimal value as ( )\u2022\u2022 dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  and ( )\u2022\u2022 dn kkkJ ,, , \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 xx . Then a new optimization problem with the \nsame cost function but an additional constraint \n( ) ( ) 0,, ,, <\u2212 \u2022\u2022 dndn kkkJJ \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 xxxx  is added. Since the additional \nconstraint is imposed in the optimization problem, the feasible \nset of this new optimization problem is smaller than that of the \noriginal optimization problem. Denote the new feasible set as \nU\nl\nj\njS\n0=\n. If the new optimization problem has no solution, then \n( )\u2022\u2022 dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  is taken as the global optimal solution of the \noriginal optimization problem. Otherwise, select \njS  from \nU\nl\nj\njS\n0=\n and use the gradient and Newton method to find a \nfeasible point in \njS  and restart the local optimal solution with \nthis new initial feasible point. These procedures are repeated \nuntil a global optimal solution is obtained. In this hybrid \nglobal optimization algorithm, we can see that the feasible \npoint finders serve two purposes: i) guarantee a solution that \nis better than the one obtained in the previous iteration; and \nmost importantly, (ii) if feasible point finders find no solution, \nthen the global optimal solution will be found. Therefore, the \nhybrid global optimization method can always correctly find \nthe global optimal solution. For the details, we recommend the \nreaders to study [25]. \nAlthough the hybrid global optimization method [25] \nguarantees the global optimal solution, the rate of \nconvergence of the algorithm depends on the initial choice of ( )oo dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx . In order to have a fast rate of convergence, ( )oo dn kk ,, , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  should be selected as close to the global optimal \nsolution. For the rational IIR filter design problems, the \nsolutions obtained using the elliptic filter design method may \nbe a good choice of this initial guess because the solution \nobtained by the elliptic filter design method is a suboptimal \nsolution. \nIII. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS \nIn this paper, a unit DC gain highpass halfband filter, that is \n( )\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2208\n\u2208=\nS\nP\nB\nB\nH \u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n0\n1~ , where \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u0394+\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u0394\u2212\u2212\u2212= \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 ,\n22\n, UPB  \nand \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u0394\u2212\u0394+\u2212=\n2\n,\n2\n\u03c0\u03c0\nSB , in which \u03942  denotes the transition \nbandwidth of the filter, is designed for the illustration of the \neffectiveness of the proposed method. Halfband filters with \nunit DC gain are selected for illustration because they are \nfound in many engineering applications, such as in wavelet \napplications. For other filters with different DC gains, such as \nlowpass filters, bandpass filters, band reject filters, notch \nfilters, highpass filters with other passbands and stopbands, \nthe design method can be applied directly. \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, our \nresult is compared with the one obtained using the iterative \napproach [9] and that using an elliptic filter. These two design \nmethods are chosen for comparisons because that using the \niterative approach [9] would be of great value for the readers \nworking in this field, while that using an elliptic filter because \nthe design objectives are the same. For the iterative design \napproach, it was reported in [9] that the magnitude response of \nthe filter in the passband and stopband is approximately \nbounded by, respectively, dB1406.0  and 27.8974dB\u2212 , if the \nfilter order is 14. The corresponding magnitude response is \nshown in Figure 2a, the zoom in the passband, stopband and \nthe transition band are shown in, respectively, Figure 3a, 4a \nand 5a. It can be seen from the figure that the transition \nbandwidth is 0.2756. To compare this result with that using an \nelliptic filter, we use the Matlab function \u201cellip\u201d to implement \nthe filter and set the filter order, as well as the passband and \nstopband specifications same as that reported in [9]. The \ncorresponding magnitude response is shown in Figure 2b, \nwhile the zoom in the passband, stopband and the transition \nT-SP-03326-2005.R2 \n \n \n6\n6\nband are shown in, respectively, Figure 3b, 4b and 5b. It can \nbe seen from the figure that the transition bandwidth of the \nfilter is 310382.1 \u2212\u00d7 . For our design, we set both ( ) 1=\u03c9W  and \n( ) 1~ =\u03c9W  SP BB U\u2208\u2200\u03c9  for simplicity reason. In fact, other \npositive weighting functions can be applied directly. For the \nparameters in the algorithm, we choose 31 10\n\u2212=\u03b5 , 10=L , \n610\u2212=\u03b2  and ( )oo dn ,, 11 , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  as the elliptic filter coefficients as \ndiscussed in Section II. After running three iterations, the \noptimization algorithm terminates because the stopping \ncriterion satisfies. The magnitude response of the filter is \nshown in Figure 2c, while the zoom in the passband, stopband \nand the transition band are shown in, respectively, Figure 3c, \n4c and 5c. The phase responses and the pole-zero plots of \nthese designed filters are shown in, respectively, Figure 6 and \nFigure 7, while the filter coefficients are listed in Table 1. It \ncan be checked that the transition bandwidth of our designed \nfilter is 410258.6 \u2212\u00d7 , which is 0.2271% of that using the \niterative approach and 45.2822% of that using an elliptic \nfilter. Our result performs much better than that using the \niterative design approach [9] because this design approach \nrequires a desired phase response and this information is \nnecessary and cannot be removed from the design procedure. \nBy an extra imposing a desired phase response on the design, \nthe magnitude response will be trade-off. Our result also \nperforms better than that using an elliptic filter because the \none obtained using an elliptic filter is a local optimal solution, \nwhile our result is a global optimal solution. \nIt is worth noting that our proposed design method can be \napplied to a strong specification if a solution exists. Since \nthere is a tradeoff between a filter length and a reduction on \nthe passband and stopband ripple magnitudes, there does not \nexist any design that gives a filter with very short filter length \nbut very large reduction on the passband and stopband ripple \nmagnitudes. If there exists a stable filter such that it satisfies \nthe specifications on the passband and stopband ripple \nmagnitudes at a relatively short filter length, then a global \noptimal solution for the optimization problem exists. Since our \nproposed design method guarantees to obtain the global \noptimal solution, our proposed design method works properly \nunder a strong specification if a solution exists. \nIn order to test the rate of convergence of the algorithm, \nfour different initial guesses of ( )oo dn ,, 11 , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  are used. These \nfour initial guesses give the same global optimal solution. The \ndesign time for choosing ( )oo dn ,, 11 , \u03b5\u03b5 xx  as the elliptic filter \ncoefficients is 2 seconds, that as the Chebyshev Type I filter \ncoefficients is 10 minutes, that as the Chebyshev Type II filter \ncoefficients is 15 minutes, and that as the one obtained using \nthe iterative approach [9] is 1.5 hours, where all numerical \nexperiments are running using a PC with Pentium 1.2GHz \nCPU and 256M bytes DDRAM. From these results, we can \nconclude that the required design time will be shorter if the \ninitial guess is closer to the global optimal solution. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe main contribution of this paper is to formulate an \noptimum rational IIR filter design problem as a nonsmooth \nnonconvex optimization problem subject to continuous \nfunctional constraints. Our previous proposed constraint \ntranscription method is applied to transform the continuous \nfunctional constraints to equality constraints. A hybrid global \noptimization method is applied to find the global optimal \nsolution. According to our numerical experiments, small \ntransition bandwidth filters are obtained. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a \nresearch grant (project number G-YD26) from The Hong \nKong Polytechnic University, the Centre for Multimedia \nSignal Processing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, \nthe CRGC grant (project number PolyU 5105\\01E) from the \nResearch Grants Council of Hong Kong, as well as a research \ngrant from Australian Research Council. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Saman S.
