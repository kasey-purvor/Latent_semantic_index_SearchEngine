Coherent scatter HF ionospheric radar systems\nsuch as SuperDARN offer a powerful experimental technique\nfor the investigation of the magnetospheric substorm. How-\never, a common signature in the early expansion phase is\na loss of HF backscatter, which has limited the utility of\nthe radar systems in substorm research. Such data loss has\ngenerally been attributed to either HF absorption in the D-\nregion ionosphere, or the consequence of regions of very\nlow ionospheric electric field. Here observations from a\nwell-instrumented isolated substorm which resulted in such a\ncharacteristic HF radar data loss are examined to explore the\nimpact of the substorm expansion phase on the HF radar sys-\ntem. The radar response from the SuperDARN Hankasalmi\nsystem is interpreted in the context of data from the EIS-\nCAT incoherent scatter radar systems and the IRIS Riometer\nat Kilpisjarvi, along with calculations of HF absorption for\nboth IRIS and Hankasalmi and ray-tracing simulations. Such\na study offers an explanation of the physical mechanisms be-\nhind the HF radar data loss phenomenon. It is found that, at\nleast for the case study presented, the major cause of data loss\nis not HF absorption, but changes in HF propagation condi-\ntions. These result in the loss of many propagation paths for\nradar backscatter, but also the creation of some new, viable\npropagation paths. The implications for the use of the char-\nacteristics of the data loss as a diagnostic of the substorm\nprocess, HF communications channels, and possible radar\noperational strategies which might mitigate the level of HF\nradar data loss, are discussed.\nKey words.

K. Yeoman\n(tim.yeoman@ion.le.ac.uk)\njets during the substorm expansion phase. These are known\nto have a highly time-dependent electric and magnetic field\nand conductivity structure, as a consequence of the elec-\ntric field and particle precipitation imposed on the night-\nside ionosphere by the Earth\u2019s magnetotail, and the result-\ning current systems. These ionospheric electric field and\nconductivity changes combine to produce the characteristic\nground magnetic perturbations during the substorm expan-\nsion phase. VHF coherent scatter radars were first used to\nstudy the spatial structure of the substorm ionospheric elec-\ntric fields (Baumjohann et al., 1981; Inhester et al., 1981;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1989) and suggested a region of low elec-\ntric field within the dynamic structure of the substorm elec-\ntrojets. The extensive fields-of-view of high-frequency (HF)\ncoherent scatter ionospheric radars make them excellent in-\nstruments for the investigation of the larger scale spatial and\ntemporal development of the ionospheric electric fields (e.g.\nMorelli et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 1997; Shand et al., 1998).\nThis is especially true for the SuperDARN network, which\noffers an extensive network of such radars in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres. One of the main advantages of\nHF radars over VHF radars is their improved ability to in-\nvestigate the high conductivity, low electric field region of\nthe ionospheric location of substorm onset, where a drop\nout in E-region backscatter, indicative of low flow velocity\n(a consequence of VHF E-region radar instrumental thresh-\nold effects, see, e.g. Robinson (1986)), has hampered pre-\nvious VHF radar studies (e.g. Baumjohann et al., 1981; In-\nhester et al., 1981). During the substorm expansion phase,\nsuch HF coherent radars have observed dynamic convection\nfeatures, which correspond to azimuthally propagating field-\naligned current systems, which may be related to reconnec-\ntion and bursty bulk flows in the magnetotail (Yeoman and\nLu\u00a8hr, 1997; Yeoman et al., 1998). Localized electrojet fea-\ntures in which ionospheric flows were suppressed to values as\nlow as 50 m\/s and accelerated up to values as high as 1 km\/s\nwithin a few minutes have also been observed at the western\nedge of the substorm-disturbed electrojet, accompanied by\nconductance variations between 20 and 100 S (Morelli et al.,\n1995). However, substorm-associated HF absorption has, in\n1632 J. K. Gauld et al.: HF radar propagation and absorption response to substorms\nthe past, limited the use of HF radar systems. A common sig-\nnature in the early expansion phase is a loss of HF backscat-\nter (e.g. Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997; Yeoman et al., 2000; Lester\net al., 2001). Such data loss has generally been attributed to\neither absorption of the HF radar signal in the D-region iono-\nsphere (Milan et al., 1996) or data loss due to ionospheric\nirregularity suppression in regions of very low electric field\n(Milan et al., 1999). Here an interval of substorm activity,\nwhich features such a characteristic HF radar data loss, is ex-\namined with a number of observational techniques to explore\nthe impact of the substorm expansion phase on the HF radar\nsystem. The SuperDARN Hankasalmi radar response is char-\nacterized and interpreted in the context of the additional in-\nformation provided by the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar\nsystems and the IRIS Riometer at Kilpisjarvi. These data\nare supplemented by calculations of HF absorption and ray-\ntracing simulations. Such a study provides a full explanation\nof the physical mechanisms which result in the loss of HF\nradar backscatter during substorms. The study also suggests\nthat the edge of the data loss itself may be used as a diag-\nnostic of the substorm process. Investigation of the HF radar\nangle-of-arrival information could also lead to radar opera-\ntional strategies, such as frequency management, which will\nmitigate the level of HF radar data loss.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ionospheric convection velocities in this study are pro-\nvided by three ionospheric radar systems, the Hankasalmi\nradar of the SuperDARN chain of coherent scatter HF radars\n(Greenwald et al., 1995), the EISCAT VHF radar at Troms\u00f8\n(e.g. Rishbeth and Williams, 1985) and the EISCAT Sval-\nbard radar (ESR), located at Longyearbyen (e.g. Wannberg\net al., 1997). The fields-of-view of these systems during the\ninterval under study are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe SuperDARN radars form 16 beams of azimuthal sep-\naration 3.24\u25e6. Each beam is gated into 75 range bins, each\nof length 45 km in standard operations. During standard op-\nerations the dwell time for each beam is 7 s, giving a full\n16 beam scan, covering 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000 km in\nrange (an area of over 4 \u00d7 106 km2), every 2 min. For the\ninterval presented here, Hankasalmi was operating in a non-\nstandard scan mode in which the integration time for each\nbeam was reduced to 2 s. This reduced integration time low-\ners the radar data signal-to-noise ratio slightly. The data pre-\nsented are thresholded as normal at 0 dB; thus, the reduced\nintegration period reduces the data coverage, as low returned\npowers will be lost. In the auroral region, where powerful HF\nscatter is commonly observed, this has little overall effect on\nthe data coverage. In addition to reduced integration periods,\nin the scan employed here, rather than the usual anticlock-\nwise sweep through beams 15, 14, 13,..., 0, the Hankasalmi\nradar scanned through the sequence 15, 9, 14, 9, 13, 9,...,1,\n9, 0, 9. This allows for the construction of full 16-beam\nscans at an enhanced temporal resolution of 64 s, in addition\nto the provision of very high time resolution (4 s) data along\na single look direction (beam 9, a beam which approximately\noverlays the main meridional chain of the IMAGE array and\nthe location of the ESR).\nDuring the interval of interest, the EISCAT VHF and ESR\nradar systems were running the UK special programme SP-\nUK-CSUB. This programme was run over 4 four-hour in-\ntervals, commencing at 21:00 UT on 20, 21, 22 and 23 Au-\ngust 1998. The ESR was, during SP-UK-CSUB, directed\nsouthward, with a geographic azimuth of 161.6\u25e6 and an ele-\nvation of 31.0\u25e6. This pointing direction allows for the ESR\nbeam to be aligned in azimuth along beam 9 of the Han-\nkasalmi radar field-of-view. The ESR was transmitting the\nGUP0 radar code, a multi-frequency long pulse. Received\nsignals were integrated over 10 s and the data subsequently\nanalyzed at a temporal resolution of 60 s. Analysis of ESR\ndata is such that the user can vary the range resolution, in\nthis case with gating of 12 km below a range of 330 km,\nwhich corresponds to an altitude of around 175 km, 36 km\nrange gates from 330 to 690 km and 72 km range gates above\n690 km range; ESR observations span the altitude range from\n110 to 500 km.\nIn SP-UK-CSUB, the EISCAT VHF radar operated in a\nsplit beam mode with one beam (beam 2) directed along\nthe boresight which corresponds to a geographic azimuth of\n359.5\u25e6 and the other (beam 1) phased 14.5\u25e6 west to an az-\nimuth of 345.0\u25e6; both beams are at an elevation of 30\u25e6. In\nSP-UK-CSUB, which is identical to the VHF common pro-\ngramme CP-4, long pulse and power profile codes are trans-\nmitted. The long pulse provides observations on each beam\nover 20 gates of range resolution 65.3 km, with the first gate\ncentered at a range of 533.0 km; this corresponds to an al-\ntitude coverage from around 280 km to over 1000 km. The\npower profile pulse scheme yields returned power measure-\nments at a range resolution of 4.5 km over 83 gates from\n85 km to 285 km altitude. Like those from Svalbard, VHF\nobservations were analyzed at 1-min temporal resolution.\nBeam 1 of the VHF radar is aligned in azimuth roughly along\nbeams 6 and 7 of the Hankasalmi radar, whereas beam 2\ncrosses beams 7\u201310 of the Hankasalmi radar.\nStandard analysis of the long pulse signal from both the\nSvalbard and VHF radars provide estimates along each beam\nof both ion and electron temperature, electron density and ion\nvelocity. The VHF power profile yields estimates of electron\ndensity in the lower ionosphere. Estimates of the Hall and\nPedersen conductance can be derived from the VHF power\nprofile measurements with the incorporation of appropriate\ninput from the MSIS-90 thermospheric model and the IGRF\nmodel of the geomagnetic field.\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS,\nBrowne et al., 1995), is located at Kilpisjarvi in northern\nFinland. The relationship between the field-of-view of IRIS\nand the ionospheric radars is displayed in Fig. 1. The sys-\ntem samples the level of background cosmic radio noise at\n38.2 MHz, which shows a predictable diurnal power vari-\nation; any anomalies in this received power result from\nchanges in HF absorption in the D-region ionosphere.

The beam intersections (Fig. 1) are shown at\n90 km, since a large proportion of the total absorption nor-\nmally occurs at around this altitude. The absorption is calcu-\nlated by subtracting the received power from a correspond-\ning quiet time power curve, and then multiplying this fig-\nure by the cosine of the zenith angle of the beam. The ab-\nsorption values attributed to the beams then represent the\nabsorption which would have occurred if the beam passed\nvertically through the absorbing layer. This data set is sup-\nplemented here by data from ground-based fluxgate magne-\ntometers, provided by stations from the International Moni-\ntor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects, (IMAGE) (Lu\u00a8hr, 1994).\nThe IMAGE array has 10 s sampling for the interval under\nconsideration here.\n3 Observations\nThe ionospheric electric and ground magnetic fields of the\nsubstorm under study here have been presented in detail by\nYeoman et al. (2000) and the reader is referred to that pa-\nper for a fuller discussion of the interval. A brief outline\nof the pertinent features is given here. Prior to 20:25 UT\non 21 August 1998, the IMF, as measured by Wind, had\nbeen northward for 20 h, and the IMF By component had\nbeen positive for 4 h. At 20:25 UT (\u223c20:58 UT when the\nfeatures are propagated to the magnetopause), both the By\nand Bz components abruptly switched polarity, turning nega-\ntive. The IMF remained in this configuration until 22:38 UT\n(\u223c23:11 UT at the magnetopause), when the IMF Bz com-\nponent magnitude reduced to near zero, although the IMF\nBy component did have a brief excursion to positive values\nat 21:18 UT (21:51 at the magnetopause). Some time after\nthe IMF Bz southward turning, at 21:40 UT, the Hankasalmi\nHF radar backscatter exhibited substorm growth phase signa-\ntures; namely an equatorward motion of the radar backscatter\n(Lewis et al., 1998; Yeoman et al., 1999). This is illustrated\nin Fig. 2a, which presents a latitude-time plot of the line-of-\nsight ionospheric velocities from Hankasalmi beam 9.\nMagnetically quiet conditions apply up to 22:50 UT, when\na clear mid-latitude Pi2 pulsation, indicating the substorm\nexpansion phase onset is observed across the IMAGE array\n(the PEL station is illustrated in Fig. 2c), with a further Pi2\nburst starting at 23:05 UT, which can be seen as a phase skip\nin the filtered PEL data, and is accompanied by Y compo-\nnent fluctuations across the IMAGE chain (see Yeoman et\nal., 2000). The Pi2 onset and intensification are marked on\nFig. 2 with solid vertical lines. The onset of the first Pi2 burst\ncoincides with a strong negative bay (up to 300 nT) in the X\ncomponent auroral magnetograms (again, the PEL data is il-\nlustrated in Fig. 2b), indicating a substorm-enhanced west-\nward electrojet. At this time, dynamic substorm-associated\nelectric fields strongly modulate the line-of-sight velocities\nobserved in Fig. 2a. The IRIS riometer (Fig. 2d presents a\nKeogram of the data from IRIS along a longitude of 20\u25e6)\nmeasures a slight increase in absorption at 22:50 UT at 66\u25e6\nlatitude, coincident with the first Pi2, and stronger, but still\nmodest, increases in absorption at 22:56 and 23:03 UT. The\nmain features of interest here are the two intervals of data\nloss apparent in the radar data at latitudes of 69\u25e6\u201374\u25e6 (Alti-\ntude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) magnetic\ncoordinates, Baker and Wing, 1989) at 22:59\u201323:02 UT and\n23:07\u201323:21 UT, respectively.

Prior to the data loss, strong radar backscat-\nter returns are measured, and a reasonably uniform velocity\nfield is observed, while IRIS measures very low absorption\n(Figs. 3a-c). In the second column, a localized region of de-\npleted radar power is observed, along with a more structured\nvelocity field (Figs. 3d and e). A modest increase in absorp-\ntion is recorded by IRIS in Fig. 3f. In column three, a more\nspatially extensive region of HF radar data loss is observed\n(Fig. 3g). At this time the absorption measured by IRIS has\nsignificantly increased, reaching\u223c 0.5 dB, and this enhanced\nabsorption covers almost the entire IRIS field-of-view, al-\nthough it is strongest in the southeast (Fig. 3i). Finally, in\nthe last column, the HF radar data coverage starts to recover\nto values similar to Fig. 3a and the IRIS absorption reduces.\nA further indication of the changing ionospheric condi-\ntions during the substorm interval may be obtained from the\nEISCAT system. Figure 4 presents Hankasalmi backscatter\npower data from beam 9, along with EISCAT estimated elec-\ntron density from the VHF power profile data from beam 2,\nthe beam most closely aligned with beam 9. The Pi2 onset\ntimes are marked with vertical solid lines and the intervals\nof HF radar data loss with vertical dashed lines, as in Fig. 2.\nThe time of the onset of the substorm expansion phase was\nat 22:50 UT, as deduced from the mid-latitude Pi2 data. The\nfirst impact of the onset at EISCAT is clearly indicated by\nthe increased electron density, which occurs slightly later at\n22:55 UT, when a brief enhancement is observed over alti-\ntudes ranging from 95\u2013200 km, before the enhanced elec-\ntron density retreats to higher altitudes. The increased elec-\ntron density, however, extends consistently to altitudes be-\nlow 95 km only after 23:04 UT (these altitudes correspond to\nmagnetic latitudes of 68\u25e6\u201370\u25e6). This is co-incident (within\nthe resolution of the data) with the second mid-latitude Pi2,\nand it is at this time when the second HF radar data loss inter-\nval starts at the highest latitudes (73\u25e6), expanding to a latitude\nof 70\u25e6 by 23:07 UT.\n1636 J.

The primary focus is to quantify\nthe changes in HF absorption and propagation of the Han-\nkasalmi system using these two data sets; but first, we use\nthe EISCAT VHF beam 2 electron density profiles from the\npower profile, together with an empirical atmospheric com-\nposition and temperature model (MSIS 90), to model the ab-\nsorption measured by beam 2 of IRIS, which is closest to\nthe EISCAT VHF beam 2. The absorption calculation uses\nthe equation for the absorption coefficient given by Davies\n(1969), appropriate for a slowly varying plasma and nonde-\nviative propagation\n\u03ba = 4.6 \u00b7 10\u22122\n[\nN\u03bd\n\u03c92 + \u03bd2\n]\n, (1)\nwhere \u03ba , the absorption coefficient is measured in dB\/km,\nN is the plasma electron density, \u03c9 is the wave angular fre-\nquency, and \u03bd an effective collision frequency between elec-\ntrons and all other particles. For radio-wave absorption in the\nHF or VHF range, the appropriate effective collision frequen-\ncies are identical to the standard collision frequencies for mo-\nmentum transfer (Banks, 1966). Here electron-neutral colli-\nsion frequencies for N2,O2,O,H, and He from Schunk and\nNagy (1978) and the electron-ion collision frequency from\nBanks (1966) have been used in the absorption calculation.\nThe values of neutral density and temperature used in the\ncollision frequency equations are obtained from the MSIS 90\nmodel (Hedin, 1991). The electron-neutral collision frequen-\ncies are actually a function of the electron temperature, but\nhere we use the neutral temperature instead, as an approxi-\nmation. While the electron temperature will exceed the neu-\ntral temperature above 120 km, the absorption has typically\nfallen to 1% of its peak value at such an altitude (Davies,\n1969), so this has a negligible effect on the total calculated\nabsorption.\nThe absorption coefficient gives the spatial rate of change\nof absorption, and the total absorption, A, (in dB) is found,\ntherefore, by integrating the absorption coefficient through\ndistance via a summation, for a ray propagating at an angle \u03b8\nto the vertical. Although the calculated absorption assumes\nstraight-line propagation, this does not mean that the rays\npenetrate the layer at a fixed angle; the Earth\u2019s curvature con-\ntinually changes the effective angle at which the straight-line\npath passes through an assumed horizontally stratified layer,\nand this has been included in the calculation, which gives\nA(t) = 4.6 \u00b7 10\u22122\ng=50\u2211\ng=1\n(h(g + 1)\u2212 h(g))(sec\u03b8(h, lat, lon))\n\u00b7\n(\nN(g, t)EISCAT\u03bd(h, lat, lon, t)MSIS\n\u03c92 + \u03bd2(h, lat, lon, t)MSIS\n)\n, (2)\nwhere g is the EISCAT range gate, t is the time, h is the\n1638 J.

Here\nwe integrate through height (i.e. \u03b8 = 90), since the absorp-\ntion measured by IRIS has already been normalized through\ndivision by the relative path length of the beam. On this occa-\nsion, the data quality beam 1 of the EISCAT VHF radar was\nrelatively poor and could not be used for absorption calcula-\ntions. Beam 2 has an elevation of 30\u25e6 and azimuth 359.5\u25e6;\nthus, it does not intersect with any of the IRIS beams in the\nmain absorbing regions of around 80\u201390 km altitude. The\n90 km ionospheric intersection of EISCAT actually occurs at\na geographic latitude of 70.95\u25e6 and a longitude of 19.13\u25e6,\nmaking the closest beam of IRIS beam 2, which is located\nsome 96 km to the south of this point. EISCAT has a time\nresolution of 1 min, and successive altitude gates are sepa-\nrated by 2.25 km. Absorption coefficients are assumed to be\nconstant between each EISCAT range gate. The calculation\nhere also requires that data exist in at least 40 of the first 50\nrange gates. The calculation is completed at range gate 50,\nan altitude of 210 km, as any contributions to the total ab-\nsorption above this height are negligible.\nThe results of this calculation are displayed in Fig. 5. The\nPi2 onset times are marked with vertical solid lines and the\nintervals of HF radar data loss with vertical dashed lines, as\nin Fig. 2. Although the absorption calculation is appropri-\nate for a location significantly poleward of IRIS beam 2, the\ncalculated (Fig. 5, solid line) and measured (Fig. 5, dashed\nline) absorption show considerable similarity in the over-\nall large-scale features, although small-scale features are not\nmodelled well, due to the structure in the absorption data\nwhich is evident in the IRIS data in Figs. 2 and 3. A negli-\ngible level of absorption prevails until 22:45 UT, after which\nthe calculated absorption increases steadily until 22:54 UT.\nThereafter, the calculated absorption remains enhanced over\nthe pre-substorm levels, but remains small at \u223c 0.2 dB. It\nshows some signs of decreasing by 24:00 UT. The calcu-\nlated absorption increases before the measured absorption,\nwhich rises at 22:50 UT. This is presumably a consequence\nof the motion of the substorm-associated absorption, com-\nbined with the spatial offset between the EISCAT and IRIS\nbeams. The modest increase in ionospheric absorption mea-\nsured by IRIS has a large spatial extent, as illustrated in\nFig. 3i, and this is supported by a comparison of the cal-\nculated absorption with additional beams of IRIS. In fact,\neven the absorption in the southeast of the IRIS field-of-view,\nat a distance of 436 km from EISCAT, is broadly similar to\nthe calculated values. The time of the absorption enhance-\nJ.

The similarity between the modelled\nand measured absorption, and the modest levels of absorp-\ntion measured throughout the IRIS field-of-view, suggest that\nthe D-region absorption in this case may be approximated as\na uniform absorbing region, and it is this assumption upon\nwhich the Hankasalmi absorption calculations presented in\nSect. 4.2 are based.\n4.2 Modelling Hankasalmi absorption\nHaving found a good overall correspondence between mod-\nelled and measured values of IRIS absorption, we apply this\nmodel to the absorption experienced by the Hankasalmi HF\nradar. The low EISCAT beam elevation angle means that\nthe ionospheric electron density profiles are not measured at\na single location. The resulting 1-D profiles are, however,\nas useful in the context of analyzing Hankasalmi absorption\nand HF propagation modes as 1-D profiles measured above\na single geographic location; they are used merely to pro-\nvide an indication of the likely ray absorption and propa-\ngation during the substorm interval. Rather than modelling\nthe total absorption for each available point in time, along a\nfixed elevation angle, as was done for IRIS, we model the\ntotal absorption as a function of the radar backscatter eleva-\ntion angle, using electron density profiles from two specific\ntimes, representing the conditions before substorm expan-\nsion phase onset and during the main interval of CUTLASS\ndata loss during the substorm expansion phase. Figure 6a\npresents the EISCAT VHF beam 2 electron density profiles\naveraged between 22:34\u201322:44 UT, a time representative of\nthe profiles from before the substorm-induced absorption en-\nhancement. The profile averaged between 23:07\u201323:17 UT\n(Fig. 6b) is representative of the active period, during which\nthe Hankasalmi data were lost. Straight-line propagation\nis assumed, at a range of elevation angles, using the Han-\nkasalmi operating frequency of 10 MHz. The assumption\nof straight-line propagation is chosen since the vast major-\nity of the total absorption occurs in the D-region and lower\nE-region, at a point in the ray path where the plasma fre-\nquency is not high enough to cause significant refraction of\na 10 MHz ray. This assumption also enables a separation of\nthe effects of absorption and changing HF propagation con-\nditions, which will be addressed in Sect. 4.3. The absorp-\ntion calculation is again based upon Eq. (2), but now with an\nappropriate value of \u03b8 calculated for each point in the sum-\nmation. However, the IRIS operating frequency is now re-\nplaced by the CUTLASS operating frequency. The absorp-\ntion calculation has been terminated when the ray reaches\nthe ground range of Troms\u00f8 at 69.6\u25e6 geographic latitude, a\ntypical range from which backscatter is received during the\ninterval under study. Finally, the total calculated absorption\nis doubled since, for each ray, the backscattered radiation has\npassed through the absorbing layer twice (on the outward and\nbackscattered paths).\nRather than calculate the total absorption of the Han-\nkasalmi HF signal, it is most useful to consider the change in\nabsorption brought about by the substorm expansion phase\nonset. The change in the absorption calculated from the pro-\nfiles in Figs. 6a and b is presented in Fig. 7. The figure\npresents the increase in absorption associated with the sub-\nstorm activity for rays reaching the latitude of Troms\u00f8. A dif-\nferent range termination would change the absorption profile\ncalculated, with the range of Troms\u00f8 being chosen since it is\ntypical for the data interval under study. Figure 7 illustrates,\nfor a given range, how a low elevation angle path has a lower\nincrease in absorption due to the substorm, since it propa-\ngates predominantly at an altitude lower than the main ab-\nsorbing region, rather than within it. The peak increase in ab-\nsorption on the propagation path to Troms\u00f8 is just over 14 dB\nat an elevation angle of 5\u25e6, with increases being smaller than\n10 dB for elevation angles either greater than 15\u25e6 or less than\n3\u25e6. This level of absorption would suggest a drop in received\npower of at most 14 dB across the entire region in which\nthe signal was being received, thereby resulting, in certain\nregions, in a complete loss of the signal. In fact, the Han-\nkasalmi backscattered power data presented in Figs. 3 and 4\ndemonstrate that some regions of the field-of-view showed\nthe complete loss of a 30 dB signal, while neighbouring re-\ngions witnessed either little or no power reduction, or even in\nsome places, an increase. This lack of consistency between\nprediction and observation suggests that in this case, absorp-\ntion is not the primary explanation for the HF radar signal\nloss.\n4.3 Modelling Hankasalmi HF propagation\nThe EISCAT estimated electron density profiles displayed in\nFig. 6 are again used as representative plasma frequency pro-\nfiles prior to and during the substorm expansion phase.

A ray-tracing simulation of the HF propagation conditions for Hankasalmi (a) prior to the substorm expansion phase onset (based\nupon the ionospheric profile in Fig. 6a) and (b) during the substorm expansion phase (based upon the ionospheric profile in Fig. 6b). The\ngeomagnetic field direction is indicated by the red lines. The changing HF propagation conditions affecting the HF rays indicated in black,\nblue and green are discussed in the text.\ndeveloped by Jones and Stephenson (1975). The ray-tracing\nprogram has been used to model radio-wave propagation at\n10 MHz, the operating frequency of the CUTLASS Han-\nkasalmi radar, through plasma frequency profiles provided\nby functional fits found for the profiles measured between\n22:34\u201322:44 UT and 23:07\u201323:17 UT. The form used for the\nfitting is the sum of two Chapman layers with the six model\nparameters adjusted to give the best fit. These functional\nfits are also shown in Figs. 6a and b. Ray trace calcula-\ntions through the profiles in Figs. 6a and b are displayed in\nFigs. 8a and b, respectively. The rays are plotted in elevation\nangle steps of 2\u25e6, and range between 0\u25e6 and 50\u25e6. The HF\npropagation is thus expected to evolve from that in Fig. 8a\nto that in Fig. 8b, between 22:34 and 23:17 UT. In Fig. 8a,\nprior to the substorm expansion phase onset, little evidence\nfor significant refraction of the HF rays is observed in the\nfirst 1500 km of the radar field-of-view. A consideration of\nthe relative orientation of the HF rays and the geomagnetic\nfield, represented by two red arrows in Fig. 8a, demonstrates\nthat a wide range of elevation angles lie close to the field-\northogonal condition, which is a prerequisite for backscatter,\nand may provide backscatter if suitable ionospheric irregular-\nities exist. By contrast, Fig. 8b, representative of conditions\nduring the substorm expansion phase, shows very signifi-\ncant HF refraction for some values of elevation angle. Rays\nabove 16\u25e6 elevation (coloured black in Figs. 8a and b) are\nJ. K. Gauld et al.: HF radar propagation and absorption response to substorms 1641\nnot strongly refracted (or indeed, absorbed) by the substorm-\nenhanced precipitation. In contrast, rays with elevation in the\nranges 8\u25e6\u201314\u25e6 (coloured green in Figs. 8a and b) are strongly\nrefracted in Fig. 8b, and cease to be candidates for orthogonal\nF-region backscatter after the substorm expansion phase on-\nset, except at low values of ground range (\u223c500 km), where\nE-region backscatter may, in fact, be most likely. Lower el-\nevation angle rays (coloured blue in Figs. 8a and b) are sim-\nilarly refracted, but the refraction process opens up a new\nHF propagation path which may sustain backscatter, with or-\nthogonality being achieved at ranges 800 \u2212 1200 km. The\nrays coloured green and blue in Fig. 8 might be expected to\nprovide ground scatter in the Hankasalmi data after the sub-\nstorm onset. However, ionospheric scatter is expected from\nthe same ranges, and only the scatter of the highest power\nwill be detected. Any ground scatter will be attenuated by the\nrequirement for the HF ray to pass through the absorbing D-\nregion 4 times. Examination of the backscatter in Fig. 2 does\nreveal that some ground scatter is identified, intermingled\nwith the dominant ionospheric scatter. This suggests that the\nground scatter is of higher power than the ionospheric scatter\nin only a few range gates.\n5 Discussion\nIonospheric radar and riometer data, combined with HF ab-\nsorption and propagation modelling, has been presented for\nan isolated substorm occurring over Scandinavia on 21 Au-\ngust 1998. Detailed observations of this substorm have been\npresented by Yeoman et al. (2000), and mid-latitude Pi2 ob-\nservations indicated that the substorm expansion phase on-\nset commenced at 22:50 UT, with a further intensification at\n23:05 UT (Fig. 2). The EISCAT VHF radar detected the\nenhanced particle precipitation associated with the expan-\nsion phase onset and intensification at 22:55 and 23:04 UT,\nwhile almost simultaneously two intervals of data loss were\nrecorded by the Hankasalmi radar, between 69\u25e6\u201374\u25e6 geo-\nmagnetic latitude, at 22:59\u201323:02 UT and 23:07\u201323:21 UT,\nrespectively, (Fig. 4). Such intervals of HF radar data loss are\ngenerally interpreted as resulting from HF absorption (Milan\net al., 1996).\nThe effect of HF absorption on the Hankasalmi radar sys-\ntem has been addressed via a modelling calculation based\nupon the electron density from the power profile measured\nby the EISCAT VHF radar and accepted electron-neutral and\nelectron-ion collision frequencies derived using the MSIS\nmodel. A comparison of the absorption calculated for IRIS,\nand the measured IRIS absorption at 38.2 MHz has demon-\nstrated that the absorbing layer was large scale, and that a rea-\nsonable agreement was achieved between the measured and\ncalculated values. Applying the same calculation, but this\ntime to the Hankasalmi radar, operating at 10 MHz, has re-\nvealed that the substorm-associated precipitation is expected\nto produce a maximum absorption increase of \u223c15 dB, at\na radar elevation angle of 5\u25e6. An examination of the mea-\nsured changes in Hankasalmi backscatter power, in contrast,\nreveals a more variable picture, with a loss of backscatter\nof 30 dB or greater in some parts of the field-of-view, while\nelsewhere very little power is lost (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is\nclear that HF absorption alone is insufficient to explain the\nbehaviour of the HF radar data during the substorm expan-\nsion phase.\nThe ray traces through the ionospheric electron density\nprofiles before and after the substorm expansion phase on-\nset presented in Fig. 8 suggest a significant alteration in HF\npropagation conditions. For elevation angles over 20\u25e6 the\ntwo ray traces are very similar, showing quasi-linear prop-\nagation, which penetrates the ionosphere. Many of these\nrays are viable candidates for F-region backscatter. The\nmost obvious difference between the ray traces is that dur-\ning pre-substorm onset, all the rays eventually penetrate the\nionosphere, whereas during post-substorm onset, the rays\nof elevation angles of less than 16\u25e6 are reflected earthward.\nSuch earthward-reflected rays will be far from satisfying the\nmagnetic field orthogonality condition required for backscat-\nter over much of their propagation path, and, therefore, are\nnot candidates for producing backscatter from these regions,\nwhereas most of the rays which are not reflected will un-\ndergo field orthogonal propagation at some point along their\npath. Clearly, a change in propagation conditions such as\nthis will result in alterations to the power distribution of the\nbackscatter. Figure 8b suggests that after the substorm ex-\npansion phase onset there will be an absence of radar re-\nturns of elevation angles less than about 16\u25e6 beyond a ground\nrange of \u223c600 km, with the possible exception of a very\nlow elevation angle mode in the range 800 km to 1200 km.\nThus, the ray-tracing calculation may offer an explanation\nfor the changes in Hankasalmi\u2019s performance during the sub-\nstorm. This prediction from the ray-tracing calculation may\nbe tested directly by an examination of the radar angle-of-\narrival information. The occurrence of such elevation angle\ndata from each scan, beam and range gate, is presented in the\nform of a contour map as a function of range and elevation\nangle in Fig. 9. The 30 min preceding the substorm expan-\nsion phase onset (22:20\u201322:50 UT) is displayed in Fig. 9a\nand the 30 min following the onset (22:50\u201323:20 UT) is dis-\nplaced in Fig. 9b. Figure 9a shows a high occurrence fre-\nquency across a broad range of angles between approxi-\nmately 5\u25e6 and 30\u25e6, and ranges mainly over 800 km, although\nthere is also a thin strip of data from about 400 km, which\nprobably results from E-region backscatter. This is con-\nsistent with the fairly uniform HF propagation predicted in\nFig. 8a. In Fig. 9b, by contrast, occurrences of between\n8\u25e6 and 17\u25e6 are strongly reduced, corresponding to the rays\nwhich were deflected from locations where they could po-\ntentially provide radar backscatter (those rays colour-coded\ngreen in Fig. 8). In addition, a new, low elevation angle mode\n(<8\u25e6) has appeared between the ranges of 500\u2013700 km, and\n1200\u20131400 km. These rays are those colour-coded blue in\nFig. 8. Therefore, it appears that those rays at very low eleva-\ntions, which achieve orthogonality near 1000 km range, and\nthe rays with slightly higher elevation angles, which achieve\northogonality near their reflection point at 500 km range in\n1642 J.

The total amount of backscatter recorded is\nalso clearly reduced between Figs. 9a and b. These changes\nin received backscatter elevation angles are largely consis-\ntent with the ray-tracing analysis presented in Fig. 8. This\nsuggests that the changes in, and losses of, backscatter at\nsubstorm onset were primarily a consequence of altered HF\npropagation conditions. The substorm precipitation resulted\nin a region of modest absorption increase of a scale size sim-\nilar to the IRIS field-of-view. HF propagation conditions in\nthis region were significantly altered, with a new, low eleva-\ntion angle propagation path opening up in the region of the\nsubstorm-affected ionosphere.\nOne aspect of the Hankasalmi radar data not explained by\nthe analysis above is why the Hankasalmi radar data show\ntwo distinct intervals of data loss, one very soon after the\nonset of the substorm at 22:50 UT (occurring from 22:59\u2013\n23:02 UT on Hankasalmi beam 9 in Fig. 2), and one just af-\nter the substorm intensification at 23:05 UT (occurring from\n23:07\u201323:21 UT). The first short-lived interval of data loss\noccurred when the first very low levels of enhanced absorp-\ntion were observed by IRIS, but they preceded the time when\nthe measured and calculated IRIS absorption reached a peak\n(Fig. 5), and thus, before the changes in HF propagation\nhad reached their full extent. This initial interval of Han-\nkasalmi data loss follows an interval of suppressed flow ve-\nJ. K.

Clearly, as Hankasalmi suf-\nfers from data loss shortly after this time, it is not an ideal\ninstrument to characterize the velocity field. However, the\nEISCAT radars do not suffer from such a data loss, and can\nprovide independent velocity measurements where the EIS-\nCAT beams are close to being collocated with Hankasalmi\nbeam 9. Both the EISCAT VHF Troms\u00f8 radar and the EIS-\nCAT Svalbard radar (ESR) have provided F-region plasma\nvelocities during the SP-UK-CSUB routine (Davies et al.,\n2000). The Troms\u00f8 split beams have been used for beam-\nswinging, in order to estimate 2-D plasma velocities in the\nvicinity of CUTLASS beam 9, while the ESR was pointing\ndirectly down CUTLASS beam 9, the configuration depicted\nin Fig. 1.

Finally,\nFig. 10c presents the Hall conductance derived from the VHF\nbeam 2 power profile equatorward of the velocity measure-\nments. The Pi2 onset times are marked with vertical solid\nlines and the intervals of HF radar data loss with vertical\ndashed lines, as in Fig. 2. An increase in energetic parti-\ncle precipitation, as evidenced from the enhanced Hall con-\nductance, peaks at 22:55 UT, and persists at a lower, but still\nenhanced level thereafter. The initial Hankasalmi data loss\ninterval can be seen to coincide with an interval of reduced\nionospheric convection velocity, whereas the convection is\nstrong for the second interval, in spite of the conductivity in-\ncrease. A possible consequence of such an electric field sup-\npression is the reduction of ionospheric irregularities in the\nlow electric field region (Milan et al., 1999). The increasing\nstrength of the equatorward flows at 23:02 UT indicate the\nreturn of the Hankasalmi data. Subsequent to this feature an\nextended data gap appears in the Hankasalmi data, after the\nelectric field has recovered, but also after the substorm pre-\ncipitation has significantly altered the HF propagation condi-\ntions. The likelihood that irregularities would have been lost\nduring the substorm interval due to reduced electric fields has\nso far been neglected, and of course, the level of scattering\nstructure present at any particular time and place cannot be\neasily assessed. The best evidence that one can obtain simply\nin support of there being an effective depletion in scattering\nstructure is to show that the electric field strength and radar\npower have been reduced simultaneously in a particular lo-\ncation. This is the case in Fig. 10, and suggests that electric\nfield reduction plays some role in the initial, short-lived in-\nterval of HF radar data loss.\n6 Summary\nData from the Hankasalmi HF radar, the EISCAT incoher-\nent scatter radars and the IRIS riometer, combined with cal-\nculations of HF absorption and propagation have enabled a\nquantitative insight to be gained into the operational con-\nstraints put upon HF radar systems by changes in the iono-\nsphere associated with substorm precipitation. While large\nsubstorm expansion phase onsets local to the radar field-of-\nview would result no doubt in the complete absorption of the\nSuperDARN HF radar signal, we have demonstrated that for\nsmaller events the radars are able to receive backscatter in\nspite of riometer absorption levels of \u223c 0.5 dB at 38 MHz.\nA more significant constraint is presented by the changing\nHF propagation conditions, which can result in the loss of\nviability of HF rays of certain elevation angles as candidates\nfor HF backscatter. In contrast, new, very low elevation an-\ngle backscatter HF propagation paths are opened up by the\nsubstorm precipitation. SuperDARN radars are frequency\nagile between 8 and 20 MHz, so careful frequency manage-\nment, when combined with ray-tracing simulations such as\nthat presented in Fig. 8, may significantly improve data cov-\nerage during the substorm expansion phase. In addition, the\nHF radar data loss may be used to track the location and prop-\nagation of the enhanced regions of D-region absorption, and\nto evaluate the modifications to the available HF propagation\npaths which are imposed on HF communications links by\nthe localized regions of the auroral ionosphere affected by\nsubstorm precipitation. In addition, it is suggested that for\nbrief intervals during the substorm expansion phase that the\nsuppression of the ionospheric electric field can contribute\nto the loss of HF radar backscatter, via a reduction in the\nionospheric irregularities responsible for forming the radar\ntargets.\nAcknowledgements.
