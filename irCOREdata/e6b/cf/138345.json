The predicted value of the optimum growth rate was 10.5 mm\/day. A value\nof 10.85 mm\/day was obtained experimentally giving a good correlation between the\nestimated and the measured results. Sporulation was optimum for the W strain at 0.99-0.95\nby B1 at 35oC. However, a significant higher production of conidia by L11 at 0.97-0.93 aw\nand at 0.97 aw and 35oC for B1 strain. Optimum conditions for spore production were\ndifferent from those for growth. Under similar ecological conditions the W and both the\ngenetically engineered strains had a different growth and sporulation pattern.\nIntroduction\nFilamentous fungi, especially Aspergillus species, are attractive hosts for the production of\nforeign proteins because of their high secretory capability [1,2,3,4,5,6]. This has been\ndemonstrated for a number products from Aspergillus nidulans and A.niger [7,8,9,10].\nA.niger is a xerophilic species which can normally tolerate quite dry environments\n[11,12,13]. Water activity (aw) and temperature are critical factors affecting the growth and\nmetabolism of fungi [14,15]. From an ecological point of view little information is available\non whether genetically modified strains will behave in a similar manner to wild type strains\nor not. No studies have attempted to evaluate this, although it has been shown that in wild\ntype strains of pharmaceutically useful fungi, subtle changes in water stress can result in a\nsignificant stimulation of secondary metabolite production [13,16]. Thus, the objective of\nthis study was to evaluate the effects of water availability (water activity, aw), solute used to\nmodify aw, and temperature on growth and spore production by a wild (W) and two\ngenetically-engineered strains (B1, L11) of Aspergillus niger.\n3Materials and Methods\nFungal strains\nA.niger wild type IMI 149007 (W), and two transformants B1 and L11 of strain AB4.1 [17]\ncontaining the full-length hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) cDNA under the control of the\nA.niger var. awamori glucoamylase promoter were used in this study [18]\nMedia preparation, incubation and growth rate assessment\nThe water activity of 4.8 % w\/v malt extract agar (MEA) (Oxoid) was modified with\ncalculated amounts of the non-ionic solute glycerol and the ionic solute NaCl to 0.99-0.90\naw. A Novasina Humidat-IC-II (Switzerland) was used to check the aw levels obtained and\nfound to be within 0.005 of the desired aw level.\nActively growing 8-day-old colonies of W, L11, B1 on MEA were used to prepare a spore\nsuspension (1.8 E+007 spores\/ml \u00b1 2%). Fungal spore suspensions were prepared in a\nsolution of Tween 80 (100\u03bcl\/l). Petri plates with glycerol or NaCl- modified MEA were\ninoculated with 5 \u03bcl of the spore suspension and incubated at 25, 30 and 35\u00baC.\nThe temporal mycelial extensions of treatments and replicates were measured in two\ndirections at right angles to each other. Measurements were recorded on alternate days\nduring the growth until the Petri plate were completed colonised [13,16,19]. A linear\nregression of the data was performed in order to calculate the growth rate. The calculated\ngrowth rate was used for statistical analysis. It has been previously shown by Trinci [20,21]\nthat the linear growth rate on a solid substrate, e.g. agar medium, is a good approximation of\nbiomass increase in liquid culture.\nSpores were recovered from Petri plates by agitating the surface with 10 mls of sterile water\n(+ a drop of Tween 80) twice and decanting into a Universal bottle. The number of spores\nwas determined using a haemocytometer and microscope (Olympus ABHZ, Olympus UK) .\nSpore number were recorded when the treatment strain had colonised the surface of the Petri\nplate fully up to a maximum of 28 days.\n4Experimental design and data treatment\nFor growth experiments a fully randomised factorial design (33) run in quadruplicate was\nused to describe the growth rate of A. niger in relation to the three strains, three\ntemperatures, five aw levels and two solute types. In all cases linear regression of increase in\nradial extension against time was used to obtain the growth rates under each set of treatment\nconditions.\nA fully randomised factorial design (33) in triplicate was used to describe the spore\nproduction of A. niger in relation to the same treatments used for growth. The number of\nspores produced at the end of each experimental run was recorded and used in the statistical\nanalysis. Orthogonal experiment optimization was computed in order to calculate the optimal\nconditions of growth rate and contour surface plots were used to find the maximum values of\ngrowth and sporulation [22].\nResults\nEffect of environmental factors on growth\nFigure 1 shows an example of the temporal radial extension of colonies of A. niger (L11) on\nmedia modified with the non-ionic solute glycerol or the ionic solute NaCl at three different\ntemperatures. This shows that mycelial extension was faster at 0.95 aw than on unmodified\nmedia with freely available water. This information was used to compare growth rates of\nA. niger in the different treatments.\nFigure 2 compares growth of all three strains of A.niger at different aw levels at 35oC, the\noptimum temperature for growth using both solutes. This shows that the wild-type strain\ngrew optimally at 0.95-0.93 aw on glycerol-modified media, but optimally at 0.99 aw when\nNaCl was used. For the two genetically-modified strains growth was optimal at 0.97 aw,\nregardless of solute used. Overall, strain L11 grew faster than the others examined. The\noverall growth pattern of the two genetically modified strains was similar, and different from\nthe wild-type strain. In unmodified medium (0.99 aw) growth of the wild type was faster than\nthe two modified strains. Statistical analysis of the data showed that all factors and\ninteractions were significant (P<0.001) for growth rates (Table 1).\n5The most important factors overall were aw, solute and their interactions. A contour surface\nplot summarises the optimum conditions in relation to aw and temperature for all three\nstrains (Figure 3). The data from the experiments were used to find the optimal conditions\nusing orthogonal optimization to determine the highest growth rates (Table 2). To confirm\nthe accuracy of the prediction, an experiment using these conditions was carried out in\ntriplicate. A value of 10.85 mm\/day was obtained verifying a good correlation between the\npredicted and the measured results.\nEffects of environmental conditions on sporulation of A.niger strains\nFigure 4 shows the effect of temperature and aw on sporulation of A. niger strains on\nglycerol-amended media. This shows that the wild type strain (W) produced most spores at\n0.97 aw, and at 35oC. There were significant differences between strains with L11 producing\na 10-fold higher amount of spores, especially at 35oC between 0.97-0.93 aw. Thus L11 has\nmarkedly different sporulation capacity compared to the other two strains examined. Table 3\nshows the statistically significant factors were aw, strain, temperature, solute and aw x strain,\naw x temperature and strain x temperature.\nThe contour surface plot of the impact of aw x temperature on sporulation capacity of L11 is\nshown in Figure 5. Optimum conditions for spore production are different from that for\ngrowth. High production of spores was found with L11 at 0.95 aw modified with glycerol at\n35\u00baC. The range of significant spore production can be defined between 0.97-0.93 aw and 33-\n35oC. This suggest that higher temperatures are more suitable for sporulation and spore\nproduction.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first time that ecological comparisons have been made between wild-type and\ngenetically modified strains of xerophilic fungi. We conclude that genetic modification can\naffect both water and temperature relations for growth, and particularly for sporulation. The\noptimal growth of the three strains of A. niger examined was found to be in the range 0.97-\n0.95 aw. The growth rate of the genetically engineered strains were similar to each other, and\ndifferent from the wild-type strain. Strains L11 and B1 had a higher tolerance to lower water\nactivity than the wild type when modified with the ionic solute, NaCl. In all cases the aw\nrange of 0.97-0.95 resulted in a faster growth rate when compared to the control (0.99 aw).\n6The use of glycerol to modify media water availability produced a higher growth rate than\nwith NaCl, probably because it can be utilised as a carbon and energy source and can act\ndirectly as a compatible solute. In contrast, high concentrations of NaCl can be toxic and this\nmay explain the differential growth patterns observed. The effect of the temperature and aw\nwere significant and both affected the growth rate. Growth patterns of both transgenic strains\nwere similar. Growth of filamentous fungi has been previously shown to be dependent on\nthermodynamic factors such as water availability and temperature [14,15].\nPrevious studies on A.niger suggest a range of 10-40oC and 0.77-0.99 optimum at 35oC and\n0.99 aw [23]. However, sporulation ranges were not considered previously and this early\nwork was carried out when no information on related A. niger group species (e.g. A\ncarbonarius) was known. Recent studies on the Aspergillus section nigri group isolated from\ngrapevine suggest optima for growth of 0.95 aw at 30-35oC [24]\nThe relative effects of the environmental factors on sporulation were more dramatic than on\ngrowth. The genetically modified strain L11 behaved in a completely different manner\ncompared to the other two strains examined, producing substantially more conidia and over a\nwider aw range, especially at the optimum temperature, 35oC. Very few studies have\nexamined the impact of environmental factors such as aw or temperature on sporulation of\nwild type strains of fungi and none on genetically modified ones [25,26,27]. For example,\nGervais et al. [26,27] showed that P.roquefortii strains from cheese grew optimally at 0.97-\n0.98 aw, while maximum spore production was at 0.96 aw. The present study suggests that\ngenetic manipulation can alter the physiology of a fungus in an unpredictable way. The two\nGM-strains have multiple gene copies integrated into the genome at more than one locus,\nand this may have caused the changes observed.\nConclusions\nFrom this study of the growth rate of genetically engineered Aspergillus niger, several\nparameters important for maximizing the growth rate have been identified. A combination of\naw, temperature and solute used to modify the aw had the greatest effect on growth rate. L11\ngrew significantly better than the other strains examined. Thus, such screening criteria based\non these environmental parameters (aw, temperature, solute type) can facilitate the selection\nof appropriate transformed strains for studying secondary metabolite or heterologous protein\nproduction systems.\n7References\n[1] Jeenes DJ, MacKenzie DA, Roberts IN, Archer DB.
