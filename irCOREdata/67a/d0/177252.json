The\nobserved results are susceptible to bias if a substantial proportion of outcome data are missing. The\nreview aimed to determine whether imputation was used to deal with missing QoL outcomes.\nMethods: A random selection of 285 RCTs published during 2005\/6 in the British Medical Journal,\nLancet, New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of American Medical Association were\nidentified.\nResults: QoL outcomes were reported in 61 (21%) trials. Six (10%) reported having no missing\ndata, 20 (33%) reported \u2264 10% missing, eleven (18%) 11%\u201320% missing, and eleven (18%) reported\n>20% missing. Missingness was unclear in 13 (21%). Missing data were imputed in 19 (31%) of the\n61 trials. Imputation was part of the primary analysis in 13 trials, but a sensitivity analysis in six. Last\nvalue carried forward was used in 12 trials and multiple imputation in two. Following imputation,\nthe most common analysis method was analysis of covariance (10 trials).\nConclusion: The majority of studies did not impute missing data and carried out a complete-case\nanalysis. For those studies that did impute missing data, researchers tended to prefer simpler\nmethods of imputation, despite more sophisticated methods being available.\nBackground\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are perceived as the\ngold-standard evaluation method for evidence based\nmedicine. Increasingly quality of life (QoL) outcomes are\nmeasured in clinical trials of new treatments, as this is\nbecoming an important factor in decision making. Com-\nmon QoL instruments include the generic questionnaires\nsuch as SF12\/SF36 [1] or the shorter EuroQoL EQ5D [2].\nWhere appropriate, disease specific questionnaires may\nalso be included. Often these outcomes are collected via\npostal questionnaires and consequently subject to a cer-\ntain amount of missing data. This can lead to a potential\nbias in the results if the missing data are not adequately\nhandled. Often assumptions are made about the missing-\nness, which may or may not be appropriate.\nPublished: 11 August 2008\nTrials 2008, 9:51 doi:10.1186\/1745-6215-9-51\nReceived: 31 January 2008\nAccepted: 11 August 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/51\n\u00a9 2008 Fielding et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:51 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/51Missing QoL data can be very informative in its own right.\nQoL data is a subjective patient reported outcome which\nperhaps makes it more sensitive than other outcomes to\nmissing data assumptions. The data may be missing\nbecause a patient is not well enough to complete ques-\ntionnaires or take part in interviews. Disregarding those\npatients without QoL information is likely to bias the\nresults, affect trial conclusions and ultimately clinical\npractice. Therefore, it is important to make use of as much\ndata as possible from as many patients as possible.\nThere are many ways researchers deal with missing data.\nFor example complete-case analysis, available case analy-\nsis, joint modelling, pattern mixture models and the focus\nin this paper \u2013 imputation. Simple imputation is a process\nwhereby a reasonable alternative value is substituted for\none that is missing. Common procedures include last\nvalue carried forward (LVCF), regression and mean impu-\ntation. Both regression and mean imputation can be\nundertaken at a population level or specific to an individ-\nual. A more sophisticated approach is multiple imputa-\ntion, which imputes several values, creating several\ndatasets. Each dataset is analysed separately and the\nresults are combined [3]. The current literature recom-\nmends this over simple imputation [4,5] but researchers\nmay overlook its advantages as simple imputation is eas-\nier to implement.\nA brief overview of some methods for missing data is pro-\nvided and is by no means exhaustive. The aim of this\nreview was to identify the imputation methods (if any)\ncurrently adopted by researchers analyzing and reporting\nthe results of clinical trials with regard to the quality of life\noutcomes. This review was undertaken as part of a larger\nproject and hence restricted to QoL outcomes in RCTs.\nIssues surrounding missing data will be similar in other\nstudies and for other types of outcomes.\nMissing data theory\nMissingness mechanism\nIn any study there will be reasons why data are missing,\nwhich may or may not be related to the outcome of inter-\nest. The main mechanisms for missing data are described\nin detail, in Little and Rubin [3]. In simple terms, missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR) is where the missingness\nis unrelated to outcome (past, present or future). Missing\nat random (MAR) can be assumed if the missingness is\nrelated to observed data (outcome or other collected\ndata). Finally missing not at random (MNAR) occurs if\nmissingness is associated with unobserved data. There are\ntwo broad types of missingness pattern: monotone and\nnon-monotone (intermittent). Monotone (or terminal)\nmissing data occurs when responses are provided at every\nassessment until a given time and thereafter missing.\nNon-monotone occurs if missing data occurs in between\nobserved assessments.\nAnalysis methods\nOne way to deal with missing data is to ignore it com-\npletely and undertake a complete-case analysis. This\nmethod is the easiest to perform, but has the potential to\nremove a large portion of the patients from the analysis.\nThis method has two major disadvantages in that it\nreduces the sample size (and thus power of study) and\nadditionally may produce biased results unless the data\nare MCAR, which may be an unrealistic assumption. An\nalternative is available case analysis, and in a longitudinal\nsetting one example is repeated measures ANOVA, which\nassumes MAR data. All patients who provide at least one\noutcome measure of a series can be included. This\nincreases the size of sample for the analysis. Specific treat-\nment differences at a given time point can be calculated\nusing the data available. Other options for model-based\nmethods include joint modelling, selection models, or\npattern mixture models [6,7], the details of which out\nwith the scope of this paper.\nImputation\nUnder simple imputation a single alternative value is sub-\nstituted for a missing value. This is followed by a com-\nplete-case analysis strategy on the augmented dataset.\nExamples of simple imputation strategies are last value\ncarried forward (LVCF), mean imputation (calculated on\nobserved data), hotdeck (random selection from those\nobserved) and regression (using other variables in the\ndataset) [8,9]. Multiple imputation is a process where sev-\neral values (e.g. five) are imputed to create multiple data-\nsets [3]. The chosen analysis method is performed on each\ndataset and the results combined. The advantages are that\nit has the ability to perform complete-case analysis but\nreflects the uncertainty of the imputed value. In addition,\nthe accuracy of the standard errors is improved. With the\nadvances in computer software, multiple imputation can\neasily be carried out. In the statistical software package\nSAS use PROC MI (to carry out imputation) and PROC\nMIANALYZE (to combine results) or within STATA use\nthe ICE command. Theoretically, multiple imputation\nmethods can handle MAR and MNAR. In the case of\nMNAR, the dropout process can be modelled and incor-\nporated into the MI procedure. However, this model can-\nnot be verified (since required data are missing) and the\nanalysis is quite sensitive to the dropout model. There-\nfore, most of the MI procedures require the MAR assump-\ntion [10]. Several approaches can be used for MI including\nregression, propensity scoring or Monte Carlo Markov\nChain (MCMC) imputation [11,12]. The choice between\nthese depends on your variable type (continuous, ordinal\nor nominal) and pattern of missingness (monotone or\nnon-monotone).Page 2 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:51 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/51Methods\nA PubMed search was carried out to identify RCTs pub-\nlished during 2005 and 2006 in the four leading medical\njournals: BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Associa-\ntion (JAMA), Lancet and New England Medical Journal\n(NEMJ). A random selection of a half was sought from the\narticles identified. The focus of the review was 'imputation\nto deal with missing QoL outcomes', therefore only those\nstudies which included QoL outcomes were considered\nfor further investigation.\nData extraction\nData extraction was a two-stage process. During the first\nstage information on each RCT included: outcome and\ntype (primary and QoL); single or repeated endpoints;\namount of missing information; was imputation used;\nwas the mechanism of missingness discussed. Data extrac-\ntion of each study was undertaken by a single researcher,\nwith queries resolved by consulting a second reviewer. To\nassess consistency between reviewers' two papers were\ndoubly abstracted by all reviewers. No inconsistencies\nwere shown.\nOnce those articles with QoL outcomes were identified, a\nsecond more detailed data abstraction was undertaken.\nThis obtained more detailed information with regard to\nmissing data and how it was dealt with. Information col-\nlected at stage two included: Study details \u2013 type of study,\nstudy setting, treatments, number of participants and\npatient demographics (age, gender etc); Proportion of\nmissing outcome data in each treatment arm; Is analysis\ncomplete case analysis or do they account for missing data\neither with modelling or imputation for the primary end-\npoint; Analysis method used for primary analysis \u2013 e.g.\nrepeated measures ANOVA; Imputation details \u2013 what\nmethod, effect on analysis (sensitivity analysis); Is missing\ndata mechanism identified.\nResults\nThe literature search described above produced 568 arti-\ncles for potential inclusion. Following a process of ran-\ndom selection, 285 (50%) articles reporting RCTs during\n2005 and 2006 were identified. A QoL outcome (primary\nor secondary) was reported in 61 papers (21%) and form\nthe basis of this review. The majority of these were pub-\nlished in the BMJ (n = 27, 44%) with 17 (28%) published\nin NEJM, ten (16%) in the Lancet and the remaining seven\n(12%) in JAMA.\nDescription of missing data\nTable 1 describes the proportion of missing data split\nbetween studies which did and did not employ imputa-\ntion. Of the 42 studies that did not perform imputation\ntechniques, six did not provide enough information to\ndetermine the proportion of missing cases. Of the remain-\ning, 36, 16 studies had less than 10% missing data in the\nprimary QoL endpoint. This is in contrast to the 5 of 19\nstudies that used an imputation method. Of the remain-\ning 14 studies which used imputation, the proportion of\nmissing data was unclear for six.\nCurrent CONSORT guidelines [13] for the reporting of\nRCTs require authors to provide a flow diagram of partic-\nipants in the trial. This should detail the withdrawals and\nreasons for withdrawal. The majority of trials (n = 50,\n82%) contained within this review did provide the flow\ndiagram and reasons for missingness such as withdrawal,\ndeath or other medical problems. However, there was no\ndetailed discussion of these reasons and the impact they\nmay have had on the analysis and subsequent results. In\nonly one study, the mechanism of missingness was dis-\ncussed and was found to be non-ignorable [14].\nQoL measures used\nThe range of QoL measures used in trials covered by this\nreview was considerable. Nine different generic QoL\nmeasures were utilised including: General Health Ques-\ntionnaire (GHQ) \u2013 seven trials; SF12\/SF36 \u2013 14 trials;\nWHOQOL \u2013 one trial; Global assessment of functioning\n(GAF) \u2013 one trial; EuroQoL EQ5D \u2013 five trials. Due to the\ndiffering disease areas the sample of trials covered, there\nwere a large number of disease specific measures used.\nExamples included: Asthma QoL score, dermatology life\nindex, rhinoconjunctivitis QoL measure, irritable bowel\ndisease questionnaire (IBDQ), Alzheimer's Disease\nAssessment Scale and the Oswestry pain score. The post\ntreatment follow up using these QoL measures ranged\nfrom one to five assessments, with the majority being col-\nlected within twelve months.\nImputation\nNineteen (31%) of the 61 trials used some form of impu-\ntation. For a description of these 19 studies see additional\nfile 1: Description of trials with imputation of quality of\nlife outcomes. Thirteen studies undertook imputation in\nthe primary analysis [14-26]. Seven of these studies\nTable 1: Proportion of missing data within the 61 studies with \nQoL outcomes\nNumber of Studies\nProportion of \nmissing data\nNo imputation Imputation Total\nNone 6 0 6\n< 10% 16 5 21\n11\u201320% 6 5 11\n>20% 8 3 11\nUnclear 6 6 12\nTotal 42 19 61Page 3 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:51 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/51employed the imputation method LVCF [LOCF]\n[15,17,19,21,23-25]. Berry et al. [16] used a combination\nor worst value imputation and LVCF. The worse value\nobserved in the sample was imputed if missingness was\nknown to be due to asthma. If missingness was unrelated\nto asthma LVCF was used. Hseih et al., [20] carried for-\nward the baseline QoL value to the post treatment and six\nmonth follow up assessment. Buszewicz et al. [18]\nemployed hotdeck imputation for missing baseline values\nand multiple imputation (using a predictive model) for\nthe missing follow up scores. Kennedy et al. [22] imputed\nmissing scores based on changes in other items when at\nleast 75% of those items were present (such as IBS severity\nscale). Petersen et al. [14] used a projection method\nappropriate for assessing responses among subjects with\nneurodegenerative disease. In the remaining study, that\nemployed imputation as part of the primary analysis, the\nimputation method was not specified, only that it was\nundertaken [26].\nSix trials reported results after imputation as a sensitivity\nanalysis. LVCF was used by four studies [27-30] and of\nthese Peterson et al. [29] also considered imputing a zero\nvalue for those that were missing and McManus et al. [27]\nevaluated the use of the mean of the series. Fairbank et al.\n[31] employed multiple imputation using a regression\nmodel as part of a sensitivity analysis. Hunkeler et al. [32]\nmentioned they used imputation in a sensitivity analysis\nbut did not specify which method.\nThe imputation process described above relates to missing\nform imputation, namely the whole QoL measure. The\nQoL instruments are made up of items which contribute\nto the score. In the case of the EQ5D measure if one of the\nfive items is missing, the overall health status score cannot\nbe calculated. However, in the SF36 if at least half the\nitems in a scale are provided, the mean of the observed\nitems is imputed for the missing items, allowing the scale\nscore to be calculated. In the trials contained within this\nreview, item imputation was not discussed, so it is possi-\nble this process was carried out, reducing the amount of\nmissing data reported.\nAnalysis methods\nIn those studies where imputation was not used (42 tri-\nals), the method of analysis was unclear in three cases\n(7%). A complete case analysis was undertaken in 30 of\n42 trials (71%). The methods of complete-case analysis\nwere: t-test (11 trials); analysis of variance (ANOVA) (one\ntrial); analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (13 trials); gen-\neral linear model (one trial); Mann-Whitney test (four tri-\nals). For those studies not undertaking a complete-case\nanalysis, a repeated measures approach was used by nine\ntrials (22%) with eight using a linear mixed model for\nthose patients with at least baseline data, thus allowing for\nsome missing values in follow up data. In the ninth trial\narea under the curve (AUC) was used for analysis.\nFollowing imputation 10 of 19 trials used ANCOVA, two\nused regression, two trials used a general linear model,\ntwo a t-test, one used generalised estimating equations,\none a stratified rank test and finally one used a repeated\nmeasures model. All of the studies which employed impu-\ntation collected data for repeated assessments, but only\nfour of the 19 trials used a repeated measures analysis.\nDiscussion\nThis review has highlighted the need to take more account\nof missing data when analysing QoL outcomes in an RCT.\nThe majority of trials identified the number of patients\nused in analysis by use of a flow diagram, as required by\nthe CONSORT guidelines [13]. Half of the trials with a\nQoL outcome performed complete case analysis. There\nwas no detailed discussion of the impact this had on the\nanalysis and bias contained within the reported results.\nComplete case analysis is easy to perform, but has the\npotential to remove a large portion of the patients from\nthe analysis. This method has two major disadvantages in\nthat it reduces the sample size (and thus power of study)\nand may produce biased results unless the data are MCAR.\nMixed model analysis assumes MAR data, however this\nassumption was not discussed by any of the authors\nwhich undertook this method of analysis.\nA fifth of the articles sampled contained a QoL outcome,\nwith nearly 31% of these performing an imputation pro-\ncedure. The rationale behind the choice of imputation\nmethod was not discussed by any of articles. The review\nshowed that of those choosing to carry out imputation,\nLVCF was popular. However, this method makes the\nassumption that the outcome is unchanged with time and\nin QoL situations this is unlikely. In some studies, you\nmight carry forward an off-treatment score to an on-treat-\nment missing value which is not likely to be that reflective\nthe truth. As Gadbury states '...although intuitively\nappealing, LOCF [LVCF] requires restrictive assumptions\nto produce valid statistical conclusions' [5]. Carpenter and\nKenward (2007) agree with this conclusion and provide a\nthorough critique of LOCF [LVCF] [33], warning against\nits use.\nThe results of this review support the conclusions of a\nreview by Wood et al., [34] which considered primary out-\ncomes irrespective of type. LVCF was popular with only\none trial using multiple imputation. Despite the advances\nin available software [12] and recommendations against\nLVCF [33], the researchers involved in RCTs tend to prefer\nthis simple method.Page 4 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2008, 9:51 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/51Conclusion\nResearchers involved with the design and analysis of clin-\nical trials should take the following into consideration.\nIdeally one should aim to avoid missing data at the outset\nthough often this is impossible. The data collection\nmethod should be chosen with the aim of reducing as far\nas possible missing data. The reasons why data are missing\nshould be recorded where possible.\nThere should be a clearer reporting of the methods used\nand the amount of missing data, which should be\ndescribed separately for each treatment arm. The impact\nthe missing data potentially has on results should always\nbe discussed and a sensitivity analysis provided. Where\nimputation is chosen, the reason for the choice of method\nshould be given. LVCF is usually not recommended,\nexcept in the generally implausible situation where out-\ncome is not changing over time. Under MAR, it is desira-\nble to include all longitudinal follow up data on the\nprimary response, up to the end point analysis [33].\nResources that may assist researchers in deciding on\nappropriate action for missing data in RCTs include the\nrecently published book by Molenberghs and Kenward\n(2007). The website http:\/\/www.lshtm.ac.uk\/msu\/miss\ningdata\/ and complementary monograph 'Missing Data\nin randomised controlled trials \u2013 a practical guide' [33]\nproduced as part of an Economic and Social Research\n(ESRC) \u2013 Research Methods Programme.
