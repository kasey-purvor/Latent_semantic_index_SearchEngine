Introduction\n[2] Subglacial basaltic eruptions create a variety of edi-\nfices, which include flat-topped tuyas [e.g., Mathews, 1947;\nJones, 1969; Smellie and Skilling, 1994; Moore et al., 1995;\nWerner et al., 1996], elongate hyaloclastite ridges (tindars\n[e.g., Jones, 1970; Gu*mundsson et al., 2002; Schopka et\nal., 2006]) and low-lying pillow lava sheets. The range of\nlandforms and facies associations reflects different vent\ngeometries, ice thicknesses and mechanisms of volcano-\nice interaction. Basaltic tuyas are generated by focused,\nlarge-volume eruptions (commonly 1\u201310 km3) and in\nIceland are the subglacial equivalents of basaltic shield\nvolcanoes [e.g., Rossi, 1996]. Their facies associations are\nwell documented, from examples in Iceland, Antarctica and\nBritish Columbia [e.g., Smellie and Skilling, 1994; Moore et\nal., 1995; Werner et al., 1996]. Tindar ridges are considered\nto be the subglacial equivalents of basaltic fissure\neruptions [e.g., S\u00e6mundsson, 1979; Gu*mundsson et al.,\n2002], and although they are much more common, with\npossibly over a thousand examples in Iceland [Chapman et\nal., 2000], fewer facies studies have been carried out [Jones,\n1970; Smellie and Hole, 1997; Smellie, 2001; Schopka et al.,\n2006]. This paper investigates the early phase of tindar and\ntuya-building eruptions and examines the parameters, such\nas magma discharge rate and cavity pressure, which may\ninfluence their mechanisms.\n1.1. Subglacial Basaltic Eruptions: Products\nand Processes\n[3] Typical facies associations at subglacial-to-emergent\ntuyas comprise a basal pillow lava pile overlain by increas-\ningly vesicular hydroclastic tephra and capped by subaerial\nlava flows [e.g., Jones, 1970; Moore et al., 1995; Werner et\nal., 1996; Smellie, 2000]. Facies associations at tindars are\nessentially similar, but lack the subaerial lava cap [Smellie,\n2000; Schopka et al., 2006]. The change in facies with\nelevation, which may be accompanied by increased degass-\ning of the magma [Moore and Calk, 1991; Moore et al.,\n1995], has been thought to reflect decreasing confining\npressures during construction of the subglacial edifice,\nwhich may eventually become subaerial once the ice roof\nhas been breached. This is because both vesiculation and the\nexplosivity of magma-water interaction are suppressed by\nhigh confining pressures [e.g., Zimanowski and Bu\u00a8ttner,\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, B03203, doi:10.1029\/2006JB004523, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Environmental Science, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\n2Formerly at Science Institute, University of Iceland, Reykjav\u0131\u00b4k,\nIceland.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JB004523$09.00\nB03203 1 of 14\n2003]. It has been commonly assumed that the pressure\nexperienced by magma emplaced in a subglacial cavity is\nequal to the weight of the ice roof, which decreases as the\nedifice grows, leading to a change in eruption mechanism.\nDespite this, the relationship between confining pressure\nand eruption mechanism is not always straightforward, as\npillow lavas may form beneath shallow water [Batiza and\nWhite, 2000] and explosive eruptions may occur at much\nhigher confining pressures; for a summary, see Smellie\n[2000]. Factors such as the magma ascent velocity may be\nimportant in determining the explosivity of magma-water\ninteraction as well [e.g., Jones, 1970]. Nonetheless, the\nstratigraphic position of pillow lavas at tuyas [e.g., Moore\net al., 1995] and reconstructed paleoice thicknesses suggest\nthat pillow lavas are typically generated beneath ice 500 m\nthick or more, corresponding to pressures >\u00015 MPa. This\ngeneralization is supported by observations and interpreta-\ntions of the 1996 Gja\u00b4lp eruption [Gu*mundsson et al.,\n2002, 2004]. However, this issue is far from resolved, as\nJones [1970], Moore and Schilling [1973], and others have\nsuggested that, for subaqueous eruptions, only 100\u2013200 m\nof water (1\u20132 MPa pressure) may be sufficient to suppress\nexplosivity and lead to pillow formation.\n[4] Dissolved water concentrations in glasses from some\nsubglacially erupted basaltic edifices show no clear rela-\ntionship with elevation. Dixon et al. [2000] attribute this to\nlow initial water contents at a British Columbian tuya,\nwhereas Schopka et al. [2006] suggest that water contents\nat an Icelandic tindar record cavity pressures that were\nsignificantly lower than glaciostatic (henceforth described\nas underpressured cavities). The latter theory is reinforced\nby the invaluable observations and models of the 1996\nGja\u00b4lp eruption, which have convincingly demonstrated that\nunderpressured cavities did develop [Gu*mundsson et al.,\n2004]. Additionally, Ho\u00a8skuldsson et al. [2006] suggest that\nvesiculation of pillow lavas at Kverkfjo\u00a8ll, Iceland was\ntriggered by a drop in subglacial cavity pressure following\na jo\u00a8kulhlaup, supporting the idea that subglacial pressures\ncan decrease greatly during eruptions. The existence of low-\npressure subglacial cavities is well documented in the\nglaciological literature [e.g., Hooke, 1984; Fountain and\nWalder, 1998], and is due to establishment of hydrological\nconnectivity between cavities and low-pressure areas such\nas the glacier snout. Factors such as the hydraulic gradient,\nmeltwater flux and meltwater temperature influence whether\nthis connection occurs [Hooke, 1984; Bjo\u00a8rnsson, 1988].\n1.2. Existing Models of Subglacial Basaltic\nEruptions\n[5] Existing treatments of subglacial basaltic eruptions\ninclude closed-system thermodynamic models of effusive\neruptions [Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks, 1997], models of\nglacier fracture and dike\/sill propagation [Wilson and Head,\n2002] and models of magma!ice heat transfer, cavity\npressure and ice deformation during the Gja\u00b4lp eruption\n[Gu*mundsson, 2003; Gu*mundsson et al., 2004].\n[6] In their important contribution, Ho\u00a8skuldsson and\nSparks [1997] model the volume changes during effusion\nof basaltic magma at the base of a glacier. They find that the\nvolume reduction upon melting ice is greater than the\nvolume increase from adding the magma, which would lead\nto a reduction in pressure and, potentially, accumulation of\nmeltwater. This could, however, only occur if the instanta-\nneous magma!ice heat transfer were highly efficient\n(>80% of thermal energy transferred). Otherwise, the sys-\ntem volume and cavity pressure would increase, as is the\ncase when cooler rhyolitic magma is erupted. Ice deforma-\ntion is not considered in these models. Ho\u00a8skuldsson and\nSparks use these results to argue that meltwater accumula-\ntion is possible during basaltic, but not rhyolitic eruptions.\n[7] Gu*mundsson [2003] and Gu*mundsson et al. [2004]\nhave since cast doubt on whether such efficient heat transfer\nmay ever occur. Using the patterns of ice melting and\nmeltwater drainage at Gja\u00b4lp, they elegantly show that the\nenergy transfer efficiency at the vent area during hydro-\nclastic magma-meltwater interaction was only 55\u201366%, and\nwas even lower during pillow lava formation. If this is\ngenerally the case then the accumulation of meltwater\nduring basaltic tuya-building eruptions, inferred from the\nsedimentology of hyaloclastites [e.g., Smellie, 2000, 2001]\nmust be explained by another process, most plausibly\nthrough the establishment of a hydraulic potential \u2018\u2018well\u2019\u2019\nthat prevents meltwater escape as the ice surface deforms\nabove the site of melting [Bjo\u00a8rnsson, 1988]. When com-\nbined with the increasing evidence for meltwater drainage\nduring both recent and ancient subglacial basaltic eruptions\n[Gu*mundsson et al., 2004; Schopka et al., 2006; Smellie,\n2006] this illustrates the need to develop new models of\nmagma-ice interaction that account for underpressured cav-\nities, ice deformation and meltwater drainage.\n[8] Wilson and Head [2002] consider the mechanisms of\ndike-fed subglacial basaltic eruptions, and suggested that\ndikes or sills may propagate into the glacier base, depending\nupon the pressures driven by volatile degassing. They infer\nthat the ice may be fractured by the rifting associated with\ndike intrusion, leading to rapid melting over a large surface\narea. Although this original approach encapsulates many\naspects of dike-fed eruptions, especially beneath frozen-\nbased glaciers where the ice is strongly coupled to the\nbedrock, there is currently no geological evidence to sup-\nport it, and the early stage of subglacial eruptions is thought\nto occur in a cavity melted by magmatic heat [e.g.,\nGu*mundsson, 2003].\n[9] In the light of the geological and observational\nevidence, what is therefore required is a model that accounts\nfor underpressured, drained cavities with deforming ice\nroofs and in which changes in cavity conditions (e.g.,\npressure) trigger transitions between different styles of\neruption. Similar models have been developed for subgla-\ncial rhyolite eruptions [Tuffen, 2001; Tuffen et al., 2007b],\nwhich examine the evolving sizes of underpressured sub-\nglacial cavities and the volcanic edifices growing within\nthem. They show that closure of the ice roof onto the edifice\nis more important at high underpressures and at low magma\ndischarge rates and can potentially lead to an intrusive\nstyle of eruption if the edifice completely fills the cavity\nand rising magma is then quenched within the edifice.\nThese models assumed eruptions occurred from point\nsources and built hemispherical edifices, with 100%\nefficient magma!ice energy transfer and cavities at atmo-\nspheric pressure. It was also assumed that the eruption\nmechanism (e.g., pillow formation\/hydroclastic eruption)\nwas insensitive to the confining pressure. These models\nhave been refined here to account for basaltic eruptions\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n2 of 14\nB03203\nfrom elongate fissures, with underpressures and efficiencies\nsimilar to those inferred for Gja\u00b4lp and eruption mechanisms\nthat also depend upon the cavity pressure.\n1.3. Evidence From the 1996 Gja\u00b4lp Eruption\nand Models of Gu*mundsson\n[10] Observations and models of the 1996 Gja\u00b4lp eruption,\nas described by Gu*mundsson [2003] and Gu*mundsson et\nal. [1997, 2002, 2004] have provided unprecedented\ninsights into the mechanisms of volcano-ice interaction,\nsome of which are listed below. (1) Deformation of the\n450\u2013650 m thick ice above the eruption site was initially\nductile. (2) The initial high heat flux and the density of the\nedifice both indicate that primarily hyaloclastite was erup-\nted. (3) Although meltwater drained from the eruption site, a\ncolumn of meltwater accumulated above the edifice. (4) The\nwell-drained subglacial cavity above the southern part of\nthe fissure had an underpressure of about 2 MPa. (5) The\nglacier at the northern part of fissure was lifted by over-\npressured meltwater and pillow lavas were formed at a\nconfining pressure of >5 MPa, leading to delayed melting.\n(6) The heat transfer efficiency between magma and ice at\nthe eruption site, fi, was between 0.55 and 0.66. This rises to\n0.62 to 0.77 if ice melted on the drainage path is also\nconsidered. (7) Less than 10% of the erupted products were\nwashed away by meltwater. (8) The \u00010.7 km3 edifice was\nerupted at up to \u00011000 m3 s\u00031 from a 6 km fissure. (9) The\nheat flux during the eruption was 10\u201320 times that during\nslow cooling.\n[11] What is not known about the Gja\u00b4lp eruption is how\nthe magma discharge rate varied with time, what morphol-\nogy the enlarging subglacial cavity had and what sedimen-\ntological features formed in the hyaloclastite. It is also\nunclear how typical the eruption was, although the wide-\nspread basaltic hyaloclastite ridges in Iceland such as\nHelgafell [Schopka et al., 2006] were probably formed in\nvery similar eruptions. Despite these minor reservations,\nmany of the parameters that are well constrained for Gja\u00b4lp\nwill be used in the model presented here.\n1.4. Ice Deformation During Subglacial Eruptions\n[12] The roof of an underpressured subglacial cavity will\nclose inward due to the weight of the glacier above. If the\ncavity radius is small compared to the ice thickness, then\ndeformation will be ductile, and the rate of closure of\ncylindrical or spherical cavities can be approximated by\nNye\u2019s law [Nye, 1953], depending upon cavity size and\nunderpressure. Closure of the cavity roof will lead to\ndepression of the ice surface above and formation of an\nice cauldron [e.g., Gu*mundsson et al., 1997]. As the cavity\nsize increases, strain rates in the ice above exceed the\nthreshold for ductile deformation, and brittle failure of the\nice occurs. This is illustrated by observations of devel-\noping ice cauldrons during subglacial eruptions and\ngeothermal melting events in Iceland [e.g., Bjo\u00a8rnsson,\n1988; Gu*mundsson et al., 1997; Jo\u00a8nsson et al., 1998;\nGu*mundsson, 2005]. Typically, the glacier surface remains\nsmooth during the initial phase of cauldron development,\nand becomes fractured at a later stage, often once the\ncauldron exceeds 50 m in depth. Since the deformation\nbehavior of ice is pressure-dependent [e.g., Mizuno, 1998],\nductile deformation may continue at depth, even when the\nice surface is deforming brittly, but the depth of brittle failure\nis likely to increase with time. With continued melting,\nthe center of the cauldron then undergoes piston-like\nsubsidence, bounded by arcuate fractures, until the cavity\nroof eventually fails and a subaerial eruption may eventually\nensue [Gu*mundsson et al., 1997, 2004].\n2. Outline of the Analytical Model\n[13] This paper considers eruptions from elongate fissures\nand point sources at the base of horizontal, wet-based ice\nsheets at 0\u0001C. The magma discharge rate per unit length of\nfissure is assumed to be constant and a range of magma\ndischarge rates, ice thicknesses and cavity pressures are\nconsidered. Heat from the magma melts a hemicylindrical\n(Figure 1) or hemispherical cavity in the glacier base. The\ncavity roof closes by ductile ice flow at a rate approximated\nby Nye\u2019s law and simulations are stopped once the cavity\nreaches 25% of the initial ice thickness, whereupon Nye\u2019s\nlaw is likely to break down as brittle ice deformation\nbecomes important. The evolving cavity size reflects the\ncompeting effects of melting and closure. A volcanic edifice\nis constructed within the cavity (Figure 1), consisting of\npillow lavas when cavity pressures exceed 5 MPa and\nhydroclastic tephra when pressures are less than 5 MPa\n(Figure 2). Although meltwater can escape from the cavity,\nan assumption of the model is that any gap above the edifice\nwill be filled with meltwater (Figure 1). It is possible that\nsome steam will also be present [Tuffen et al., 2002a],\nFigure 1. Cartoon showing a fissure eruption at the base\nof a glacier. A hemicylindrical cavity has been melted above\nthe fissure and a flat-topped volcanic edifice is emplaced\nwithin it. Any space above the edifice is filled by meltwater,\npossibly with some steam, which provides space for\nexplosive magma-water interaction. Meanwhile, the cavity\nroof closes toward the edifice, forming an ice cauldron on\nthe glacier surface. Meltwater drains away from the eruption\nsite at the glacier base.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n3 of 14\nB03203\ndepending on the relative rates of magma-meltwater and\nmeltwater-ice heat transfer, but the amount of steam will not\nbe quantified here. The model predicts how the edifice\ngrows and the cavity enlarges during the early stages of an\neruption and also indicates the depth of meltwater\/steam\nabove the edifice. Table 1 lists the variables and constants\nused.\n[14] The effects of different cavity underpressures on the\ncavity evolution are studied, and additionally some runs are\ncarried out with underpressures of 2 MPa, which is the\nvalue inferred for the southern end of the Gja\u00b4lp fissure. In\nthe latter case it is assumed that the cavity remains at\nglaciostatic pressure until this is less than 5 MPa, at which\ncase an underpressure of 2 MPa develops (Figure 2). This is\nconsistent with the transition from undrained pillow lava\neffusion (as occurred at the north end of the Gja\u00b4lp fissure) to\na well-drained hydroclastic eruption. A general model that\npredicts the underpressure solely based on the thermody-\nnamics of an eruption [e.g., Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks, 1997]\nis not globally applicable as it cannot deal with the\nhydrological patterns that are unique to each eruption site.\nThe model is applied to eruptions from both point sources\nand elongate fissures.\n2.1. Heat Transfer From Magma to Ice\n[15] The total amount of thermal energy released by\ncooling and crystallizing basaltic magma, ET, is given by\nET \u00bc rl clDTl \u00feDxLl\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere rl denotes magma density, cl denotes magma heat\ncapacity,DTl denotes the temperature change of the magma,\nDx denotes the change in crystallinity and LL denotes the\nheat of fusion of the magma [Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks,\n1997]. This energy is dominated by the contribution from\nthe change in magma temperature, with even complete\ncrystallization of the magma contributing less than 15% of\nET. Given that the analysis in this paper is only\napproximate, initial phenocryst contents can vary widely\nand subglacially erupted basaltic deposits can vary from\nglassy (common in hyaloclastites [e.g., Jones, 1970]) to\nmostly crystalline (common in intrusions and pillows [e.g.,\nSchopka et al., 2006]), the effects of crystallization will be\nignored and so equation (1) condenses to\nET \u00bc rlclDTl \u00f02\u00de\nand ET is thus the maximum thermal energy that can be\ntransferred from the unit volume of magma to the ice. In\norder to simplify matters, all magma is assumed to be\nvesicle-free, although the presence of vesicles reduces the\nvalue of ET [see Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks, 1997].\n2.2. Mechanisms and Efficiency of Heat Transfer\n[16] Whereas much of the heat in rising magma is rapidly\nreleased during contact with meltwater, the remainder is\nmore slowly released from material buried within the edifice\n[Gu*mundsson, 2003]. The models presented here consider\nonly rapid energy release; the energy released during slow\ncooling is ignored. The heat transfer efficiency fi is the\nfraction of the magmatic heat energy that is transferred near-\ninstantaneously to melt ice [Gu*mundsson, 2003;\nGu*mundsson et al., 2004]. This is somewhat less than\nthe efficiency of heat transfer from magma, as fi accounts\nfor the 10\u201320% of magmatic heat energy that may be used\nto heat meltwater by 10\u201320\u0001C and then lost from the\nsystem [Gu*mundsson, 2003]. Therefore the heat flux\navailable for ice melting Qm is equal to\nQm \u00bc Ql t\u00f0 \u00deEfi \u00f03\u00de\nFigure 2. Diagram indicating the possible relationship between cavity pressure (Pc) and glaciostatic\npressure (Pg) during subglacial eruptions. To the left of the diagonal line Pc = Pg, the glacier is lifted; to\nthe right, cavity underpressure (indicated byDP) leads to cavity roof closure and ice surface deformation.\nThe shaded area indicates the probable pressure conditions during the Gja\u00b4lp eruption [from\nGu*mundsson et al., 2004], with the northern (N) and southern (S) ends of the fissure indicated. The\narrow indicates the inferred pressure path during an eruption that starts with pillow effusion but becomes\nexplosive as roof thinning reduces the cavity pressure to less than 5 MPa.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n4 of 14\nB03203\nwhere Ql(t) is the instantaneous magma discharge rate and E\nis the total thermal energy per unit volume of the magma.\nThree different heat transfer efficiencies for three distinct\neruption scenarios are considered.\n2.2.1. Pillow Lava Formation (P > 5 MPa)\n[17] Conductive heat loss from pillow lavas is retarded by\nthe formation of a chilled rind, and accelerated by fracturing\nof the pillows [e.g., Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks, 1997; Tuffen\net al., 2002a; Wilson and Head, 2002]. Cooling models\nindicate that individual pillows may take \u0001105 s to\ncool [Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks, 1997] and the effective heat\ntransfer efficiency from the edifice may be as low as 0.1, if\nthe heat flux from buried pillows is ignored [Gu*mundsson,\n2003]. A value of fi = 0.1 is used for the models in this\nscenario.\n2.2.2. Hydroclastic Eruptions (P < 5 MPa, Cavity\nNot Completely Filled by Edifice)\n[18] Heat loss from magma during hydroclastic eruptions\nis much more rapid, due to the significantly higher surface\narea for heat exchange [e.g., Dobran and Papale, 1993;\nZimanowski et al., 1997]. This is demonstrated by the far\ngreater surface area\/volume ratio of typical hydroclastic\ntephra (3000 m\u00031) than typical pillow lavas (12 m\u00031).\nThese values were calculated for spherical bodies with the\nsizes of hydroclasts (0.25 mm radius) and pillows (0.25 m\nradius) taken from Smellie and Hole [1997].\n[19] Estimates of the diffusion time for heat loss from\nmagma fragments and observations of the 1996 Gja\u00b4lp\neruption suggest that fi may be in the range 0.5\u20130.61\n[Gu*mundsson, 2003, Gu*mundsson et al., 2004]. The\nefficiency of heat transfer from magma (0.63\u20130.77) was\nsomewhat greater. In order to fully cover the plausible range\nof fi, values of 0.5 and 0.7 are used for this scenario in the\nmodels. The latter value is relevant to more thermally\nefficient melting than Gja\u00b4lp, where little heat energy is lost\nas the meltwater is heated by less than 10\u0001C. The effects of\nconfining pressure upon phreatomagmatic fragmentation\nprocesses, and the consequences for heat transfer efficien-\ncies, are not well understood, so fi is assumed not to change\nwith cavity pressure. Also, it is important to note that the\nfactors controlling meltwater temperature during a given\neruption are not currently known.\n2.2.3. Intrusive Eruption (When Cavity Filled)\n[20] If the edifice completely fills the cavity, rising\nmagma intrudes and quenches within the slowly cooling\nedifice and only a small proportion of rising magma reaches\nthe glacier base [Tuffen et al., 2001, 2002a]. The rate of heat\ntransfer will therefore be similar to that from a cooling\nvolcanic edifice shortly after the end of an explosive\neruption. As the flux of residual heat from the newly formed\nGja\u00b4lp edifice was \u00015\u201310% that of the heat flux during the\neruption [Gu*mundsson et al., 2004], a value of 0.1 will be\ntaken for fi.\n2.3. Melting of Ice\n[21] Heat energy from the magma is used to melt ice and\nto heat and potentially vaporize the meltwater formed. The\nmeltwater temperature may be in the range 0\u201320\u0001C or even\nhigher [e.g., Gu*mundsson et al., 1997, 2004] and in some\ncases a small quantity of steam may be even be generated,\nespecially at low confining pressures, although the thermal\neffect of steam formation will not be addressed here. The\nvolume of ice melted per unit volume of magma vi is given\nby\nvi \u00bc firiLi\nclrlDTl\u00de\u00bd \t \u00f04\u00de\nwhere fi is the magma!ice heat transfer efficiency (as\ndescribed by Gu*mundsson [2003] and Gu*mundsson et al.\n[2004]), ri is the density of ice, and Li is the heat of fusion\nof ice.\n[22] Melting is assumed to occur evenly over the roof of\na hemicylindrical or hemispherical cavity of radius R\n(Figure 1).

Deformation of Ice\n[23] According to Nye\u2019s law, the roof of a cylindrical or\nspherical cavity within an infinite ice sheet will deform at a\nrate R0d given by\nR0d \u00bc R\nDP\nnB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f07\u00de\nand\nR0d \u00bc 3R\nDP\n2nB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f08\u00de\nrespectively, where DP is the cavity underpressure, n is\nGlen\u2019s flow law constant (\f3) and B is an ice deformation\nparameter, taken as 5.3 \u000b 107 Pa s1\/3 [e.g., Hooke, 1984].\nThese deformation rates are applied to hemicylindrical and\nhemispherical cavities, although basal drag may inhibit wall\nclosure and lead to a broader cavity shape [Hooke et al.,\n1990]. Nye\u2019s law applies when the cavity radius is small\ncompared to the ice thickness [Nye, 1953], but breaks down\nat large cavity sizes because variations in the confining\nstress at the cavity roof become significant, heterogeneous\nstrain within the ice leads to spatial variations in rheology\nand ice may deform brittly. For the purpose of this paper, it\nis assumed that Nye\u2019s law will provide an adequate\napproximation of deformation rates when the cavity radius\nis less than 25% of the ice thickness (i.e., the early stages of\nan eruption). This corresponds to the approximate cavity\nsize at which brittle deformation of the ice surface above\nbecomes important (M. T. Gu*mundsson, personal com-\nmunication, 2002). It is important to recognize that Nye\u2019s\nlaw only applies to hemispherical or hemicylindrical\ncavities. Closure of irregularly shaped cavities can only be\nsimulated by two or three dimensional models [e.g., Cutler,\n1998], which are beyond the scope of this paper.\n2.5. Cavity Pressure\n[24] Two cavity pressure regimes are considered in the\nmodels. First, runs have been carried out using a range of\ndifferent cavity underpressures between 1 and 5 MPa, to\ninvestigate how different underpressures beneath a given ice\nthickness affect the evolution of the cavity and the eruption\nmechanism. Secondly, a more realistic scenario is consid-\nered, which is based on the inferred pressure conditions\nduring the Gja\u00b4lp eruption and illustrated in Figure 2. Here\ncavity pressure is assumed to be glaciostatic when the\nglaciostatic pressure exceeds 5 MPa, with formation of\npillow lavas. However, once the glaciostatic pressure falls\nto less than 5 MPa, due to roof thinning, an underpressure of\n2 MPa develops and a hydroclastic eruption occurs. The\nunderpressure in the cavity DP, which drives closure of the\ncavity roof, is defined as\nDP \u00bc Pg \u0003 Pc \u00f09\u00de\nwhere Pg is the pressure from the overlying ice and Pc is the\ncavity pressure. The maximum possible underpressure\nDPmax occurs when the cavity is at atmospheric pressure\n(\u00010.1 MPa), and is given by\nDPmax \u00bc righi \u0003 0:1 MPa \u00f010\u00de\nwhere ri is ice density, g is gravitational acceleration and hi\nis the roof thickness. During melting, hi will decrease, and\nlead to a reduction in DPmax.\n2.6. Cavity Size Evolution\n[25] The rate at which the cavity size changes is\ndetermined by the relative rates of enlargement by melting\nand closure by deformation. The rate of cavity enlargement\ndR\/dt is thus given by the following relation:\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc r0m \u0003 r0d : \u00f011\u00de\nSubstituting equation (5) or (6) for r0m and equation (7) or\n(8) for r0d into (11) yields\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc viQl\npRL\n\u0003 R DP\nnB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f012\u00de\nfor a hemicylindrical cavity and\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc viQl\n2pR2\n\u0003 3R DP\n2nB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f013\u00de\nfor a hemispherical cavity, where Ql is the volume flux of\nmagma (m3 s\u00031). Equations (12) and (13) can be combined\nwith equation (4), for vi, to give\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc Ql\npRL\nfi\nriLi\nclrlDTl\u00bd \t\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0003 R DP\nnB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f014\u00de\nand\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc Ql\n2pR2\nfi\nriLi\nclrlDTl\u00bd \t\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0003 3R DP\n2nB\n\u0001 \u0002n\n\u00f015\u00de\nfor hemicylindrical and hemispherical cavities, respectively.\n[26] Equations (14) and (15) have been solved numeri-\ncally, providing values of melt-back rate, ice deformation\nrate and cavity radius that were calculated incrementally\nover a series of time steps where tn+1 = 1.01 tn. Simulations\nwere continued until the cavity radius reached 25% of the\ninitial ice thickness.\n[27] Initially, melting is focused over a small surface area\nand the cavity radius increases rapidly, at 10\u00032\u201310\u00033 m s\u00031.\nThese rates are similar to melting rates estimated by\nHo\u00a8skuldsson et al. [2006] and inferred from observations\nof the 1996 Gja\u00b4lp eruption [Gu*mundsson et al., 1997].\nHowever, the melt-back rate soon drops and the rate of\nclosure increases as the cavity grows. If the melting rate and\nunderpressure are constant, the cavity radius may reach an\nequilibrium value, at which melting balances deformation\n[Tuffen et al., 2002a]. However, this is unlikely to occur\nunless the melting rate is very low; the cavity size never\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n6 of 14\nB03203\nreaches equilibrium for any of the eruptions considered in\nthis paper.\n2.7. Edifice Volume and Space in Cavity\n[28] Assuming that the amount of erupted material\nremoved by flowing meltwater is negligible, the edifice\nvolume Ve is given by\nVe t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ t\n0\nQlSdt \u00f016\u00de\nwhere S is a packing coefficient, equal to 1 for pillow lava and\n1.9 for hyaloclastite (based on a dry density of 1400 kg m\u00033\nfor the hyaloclastite ridge formed in the Gja\u00b4lp eruption, and a\nmagma density of 2600 kg m\u00033 [Gu*mundsson et al.,\n2002]). The value for hyaloclastite is greater than 1 due to\npore space between particles. It is assumed that the top of the\nedifice is horizontal when a water column is present, as in\nsubglacial basaltic successions the generally gentle dip of\nbedding planes in hydroclastic tephra (excluding foreset\nbedding) reflects deposition from subaqueous density\ncurrents [e.g., Jones, 1970; Smellie and Hole, 1997; Werner\nand Schmincke, 1999]. In this case, the height of the edifice\nhe can be calculated from the relations\nsin\u00031 X\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe X\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u0003 X 2\u00f0 \u00de\np\n\u0003 pY\n2\n\u00bc 0 \u00f017\u00de\nfor a hemicylindrical cavity and\nX 3 \u0003 3X\u00fe 2Y \u00bc 0 \u00f018\u00de\nfor a hemispherical cavity, where X = he\/R and Y = edifice\nvolume\/cavity volume.\n[29] Tuffen [2001] and Tuffen et al. [2007b] envisage two\nscenarios: one in which the cavity enlarges more quickly\nthan the edifice and meltwater\/steam is always present (A),\nand one in which the edifice completely fills the cavity (B).\n2.7.1. Edifice Radius Less Than Cavity Radius\n[30] For this scenario a significant column of meltwater\nand\/or steam exists above the growing edifice, and rising\nmagma can interact explosively with meltwater if the cavity\npressure is sufficiently low (for the purposes of this model,\n<5 MPa). A Surtseyan style of eruption will occur, with\ntephra jets feeding subaqueous debris currents [e.g., White,\n1996, 2000; Smellie, 2001]. Fragmentation permits rapid\nheat transfer from magma to meltwater [Dobran and\nPapale, 1993; Zimanowski et al., 1997; Gu*mundsson,\n2003], and the heat transfer efficiency from magma to ice\nmay be as high as 0.66 [Gu*mundsson et al., 2004]. Rising\nmagma cools in contact with meltwater\/steam rather than\nwithin the edifice and edifice growth is predominantly\nexogenous. This inference is supported by field evidence\nfrom Surtseyan subglacial basaltic successions in Antarctica\n[Smellie and Hole, 1997; Smellie, 2001], where the paucity\nof fragments of the underlying pillow lava pile indicates that\nexplosive fragmentation occurred at or very close to the\nedifice-meltwater interface.\n[31] The grain size of the phreatomagmatic tephra formed\nwill depend upon the explosivity of magma-water interac-\ntion and be influenced by the confining pressure and the\nability of magma and water to mix [e.g., Wohletz, 1983;\nZimanowski et al., 1997]. The structure of the deposits\nmay be variable, as they will reflect a wide variety of\npotential emplacement mechanisms, such as high- and\nlow-concentration turbidity currents, grain flows and debris\nflows [White, 1996; Smellie and Hole, 1997; White, 2000;\nSmellie, 2001], and the eruption may be continuous or\npulsatory. Nonetheless, there is the potential for well-\nstratified deposits to be generated, as there is scope for\nsignificant horizontal and vertical translation of particles in\nwater-supported currents. The sedimentology of the tephra\nformed is further discussed in section 3.4.\n2.7.2. Edifice Fills Cavity\n[32] If the edifice completely fills the cavity, there is no\ncolumn of meltwater\/steam within which explosive hydro-\nclastic fragmentation can occur and no scope for transport\nof particles by water-supported currents. The eruption\nmechanism is therefore likely to be dominantly intrusive,\nwith rising magma being quenched within the edifice. The\ngeological record of this activity may be pillow lavas that\nintrude wet, poorly consolidated hyaloclastite, similar to\nfacies CH-P of Werner and Schmincke\u2019s [1999] study. Well-\nstratified deposits will not be generated, even if the eruption\nwere pulsatory. In rhyolitic eruptions, intrusive lava lobes\nwithin quench hyaloclastite are formed and a small propor-\ntion of the magma may still reach the glacier base, where it\ntriggers localized melting [Tuffen et al., 2002a]. The melting\nrate is likely to be much lower than during hydroclastic\nfragmentation, and fi is estimated to be only 0.1. The\neruption mechanism will remain intrusive unless sufficient\nmagma rises to the glacier base to melt a new cavity above\nthe edifice.\n3. Results of the Models\n[33] The model calculates the radius of the growing\nedifice and evolving subglacial cavity, and also the eleva-\ntion of the ice surface. Figure 3 shows typical graphs\nproduced by the model, for initially hydroclastic eruptions\nbeneath ice 600 m thick. Deformation is insignificant when\nthe magma discharge rate is high (Figure 3a), and a\nconsiderable water column develops above the edifice,\nproviding scope for tephra deposition by eruption-fed\naqueous density currents. Ice deformation is much more\nimportant at lower magma discharge rates (Figure 3b), and\nthe edifice: cavity volume ratio increases to 1, in which case\nthe edifice completely fills the cavity, leading to an intrusive\nstyle of eruption.\n3.1. Explosive or Intrusive Eruptions?\n[34] The critical magma discharge rate Qcr was deter-\nmined for a specified vent geometry, cavity underpressure,\nmagma type and heat transfer efficiency. Below Qcr, the\nedifice fills the cavity, favoring an intrusive eruption. Above\nQcr, the edifice never completely fills the cavity, and the\neruption is assumed to be explosive throughout. The model\nwas run for a range of ice thicknesses (Figure 4). It must be\nnoted that these calculations have been carried out for\nconfining pressures <5 MPa. For comparison, equivalent\nvalues for rhyolitic magma are also given. As may be\nexpected, intrusive eruptions are favored by high cavity\nunderpressure and low magma discharge rate. Qcr is con-\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n7 of 14\nB03203\nsiderably lower for eruptions from point sources because\nmelting is more focused. Qcr is a factor of \u00012 lower for\nbasalt than rhyolite, due to its higher initial magma tem-\nperature. Similarly, Qcr is lowest for a given magma type\nand magma discharge rate if the heat transfer efficiency is\nhigh during an eruption. A similar technique has been used\nto estimate the magma discharge rate during Quaternary\nsubglacial rhyolite eruptions at Torfajo\u00a8kull, Iceland [Tuffen\net al., 2007b].\n[35] The potential mechanisms of subglacial basaltic\nfissure eruptions have been explored by using known\nmagma discharge rates from historical subaerial eruptions\nin Iceland as inputs for the model, together with the inferred\nice thicknesses, cavity pressures and approximate magma\ndischarge rates during 20th century subglacial eruptions.\n3.2. Simulations of 20th Century Icelandic Eruptions\n[36] The two largest subglacial basaltic eruptions in Iceland\nin the 20th century were those at Katla in 1918 and Gja\u00b4lp\nin 1996 [Gu*mundsson, 2005]. The Katla 1918 eruption\noccurred on a \u00012 km fissure beneath 450 m of ice and\nformed glassy tephra generated by explosive magma-water\ninteraction, much of which was removed from the eruption\nsite and deposited on the sandur by a 1\u20138 km3 jo\u00a8kulhlaup.\nThe magma discharge rate could have been as high as\n104 m3 s\u00031 during the \u00012 hour subglacial phase\n[Gu*mundsson and Cook, 2004], and the underpressure is\nnot known. As summarized in section 1.4, the Gja\u00b4lp\neruption occurred on a 6 km long fissure beneath 450\u2013\n650 m of ice and involved both hydroclastic fragmentation\nand pillow lava effusion. The magma discharge rate is\nestimated at \u00011000 m3 s\u00031 for the first two days (calculated\nFigure 3. Graphs showing the position of the cavity roof and top of the edifice during two eruptions\nfrom a point source beneath 600 m of ice. (a) At a high magma discharge rate (100 m3 s\u00031), the cavity\nsize increases much more quickly than the edifice, creating a significant depth of meltwater\/steam in\nwhich hydroclastic fragmentation can occur. (b) At a lower magma discharge rate, closure of the cavity is\nmore important and the edifice soon completely fills the cavity (arrow), leading to an intrusive style of\neruption.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n8 of 14\nB03203\nby Gu*mundsson et al. [2004]), and the underpressure was\nbetween 0 and 2 MPa.\n[37] This data has been plotted on Figure 5, together with\nthe critical magma discharge rates for basaltic eruptions on a\n1.5 km fissure beneath 600 m of ice. For the Katla and Gja\u00b4lp\neruptions, the magma discharge rate per 1.5 km of fissure\nhas been used, which enables direct comparison with the\nmodeled values of Qcr. It is seen that both eruptions plot\nfirmly in the \u2018\u2018explosive\u2019\u2019 field for all plausible values of\ncavity underpressure, which is consistent with the explosive\nhydroclastic fragmentation that dominated both eruptions.\nThis means that the emplacement of pillows at the northern\nend of the Gja\u00b4lp fissure was probably due to high confining\npressure, as suggested by Gu*mundsson et al. [1997], rather\nthan cavity filling and the transition to an intrusive eruption.\n[38] It is also instructive to consider what would have\nhappened if historic basaltic eruptions in Iceland had\noccurred beneath ice. The eruptions chosen are Laki 1783,\nHeim\u00e6y 1973 and Krafla 1975\u20131984, as the magma\ndischarge rate and fissure length for all three are well\nconstrained [Thordarson and Self, 1993; Thorarinsson et\nal., 1973; Harris et al., 2000]. In each case the peak\ndischarge rate was taken and normalized to the rate per\n1.5 km of fissure. All eruptions except Krafla 1984 plot well\nwithin the explosive field for a reasonable underpressure of\n2 MPa (Figure 5), indicating that the explosive magma-\nwater interactions should be common for subglacial fissure\neruptions. It is further inferred that suppression of explo-\nsivity during fissure eruptions may be primarily controlled\nby high confining pressures rather than low magma dis-\ncharge rates. Even if tuya-building eruptions involved the\nlow magma discharge rates of 5\u201310 m3 s\u00031 inferred for\npostglacial shield volcanoes [Rossi, 1996], the eruptions\nwill still fall within the explosive field, as they occur from\npoint sources, which require much lower values of Qcr than\nelongate fissures (Figure 4).\n[39] Flow localization is an important phenomenon dur-\ning basaltic fissure eruptions [e.g., Wylie et al., 1999] and in\nsubglacial eruptions could lead to a change from fissure to a\npoint source, with melting becoming focused over a hemi-\nspherical cavity roof. Given that Qcr is significantly lower\nfor point sources than fissure eruptions (Figure 4), this may\ncause initially intrusive eruptions to become explosive. An\nexample of fissure focusing occurred during the 1973\nEldfell eruption at Heim\u00e6y, Iceland, when a magma dis-\ncharge rate of 100 m3 s\u00031 on a 1.5 km long fissure dwindled\nto 10 m3 s\u00031 from a point source [Thorarinsson et al.,\n1973]. The changing discharge rate during this eruption is\nplotted on Figure 6, together with values of Qcr for a 1.5 km\nlong fissure and point source. The effects of more focused\nmelting compensate for the reduced magma discharge rate,\nand the eruption is expected to remain explosive through-\nout. However, if the initial discharge rate were much lower,\nthe focusing effect could trigger a change in the style of\nfissure eruptions.\n3.3. Models Applied to the Subglacial Eruption\nof Helgafell\n[40] Schopka et al. [2006] have provided a detailed\ndescription of the Pleistocene tindar ridge Helgafell, formed\nin an eruption analogous to the Gja\u00b4lp eruption. The 300 m\nhigh edifice was emplaced on a \u00012 km long fissure beneath\nice >500 m thick. Pillows are notably absent, and the\neruption predominately generated hydroclastic tephra.\nContrasting facies associations on the northwestern and\nsoutheastern flanks of the edifice indicate pronounced\ndifferences in the eruptive mechanisms and depositional\nenvironment. Tephra on the northwestern flank is locally\nwell stratified and was deposited by eruption-fed subaqueous\ndensity currents (corresponding to the explosive eruption\nscenario). The structure of the deposits indicates that melt-\nwater drained from the eruption site to the northwest, parallel\nto the glacier flow direction as indicated by striae. In contrast,\ntephra on the southeastern flank is mostly massive, and\nFigure 4. Critical magma discharge rate Qcr shown as a function of cavity underpressure, for eruptions\nbeneath 600 m of ice. Dotted lines indicate rhyolite; solid lines indicate basalt. Qcr for eruptions from\npoint sources and 1.5 km fissures are given. In each case, two curves are given: top one is for fi = 0.5, and\nbottom one is for fi = 0.7.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n9 of 14\nB03203\nintruded by peperitic lava bodies, which were intruded\nwithin wet, unconsolidated tephra and whose abundance\ngenerally decreases upward through the edifice (intrusive\neruption scenario). The water contents of glassy samples\nfrom the southeastern flank indicate that quenching pres-\nsures remained low and roughly constant, at around 1 MPa\nduring construction of the edifice. The fact that pressures do\nnot correlate with elevation is thought to indicate cavity\npressures were substantially lower than glaciostatic, due to\ndrainage of meltwater from the vent area.\n[41] Assuming that the eruption duration was similar to\nthat of Gja\u00b4lp (13 days), the edifice volume implies a mean\nmagma discharge rate of \u000120 m3 s\u00031. The underpressure\nmay have decreased from \u00012.5 MPa close to the onset to\n\u00011 MPa near the end of the eruption, based on the water\ncontents in glassy samples from the succession. When this\nconstant magma discharge rate and underpressure range is\nplotted on Figure 5 as H(1), it appears that the eruption was\nclose to the explosive-intrusive transition, and would be\nexpected to generally become more explosive as the erup-\ntion went on and the underpressure decreased \u2013 consistent\nwith the facies associations seen. In reality, the magma\ndischarge rate from Helgafell and similar eruptions is\nunlikely to have been constant throughout the eruption,\nand instead probably followed a similar pattern of waxing\nand waning flow to that described for subaerial fissure\neruptions in Iceland by Wadge [1981] and Harris et al.\n[2000]. In this case, the initial magma discharge rate may\nhave exceeded the average by a factor of 5\u201310. This\nscenario has been schematically drawn on Figure 5 as\nH(2), and shows that the eruption would have been mostly\nexplosive, but close to the explosive-intrusive transition.\nSuch an inference is consistent with the facies formed at\nHelgafell, where the eruption was predominantly explosive\nbut some intrusion occurred, especially at the onset of the\neruption.\n[42] The fact that both \u2018\u2018explosive\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018intrusive\u2019\u2019\ndeposits were synchronously emplaced during an eruption\nthat may have only lasted for a few days reflects an added\ndegree of complexity that the current models cannot account\nfor \u2013 that of heterogeneous patterns of ice deformation.\nInstead of deforming symmetrically around the locus of\nmelting, the ice at Helgafell is inferred to have principally\nflowed to the northwest, parallel to the regional ice flow\ndirection [Schopka et al., 2006]. This encouraged drainage\nof meltwater to the northwest, maintaining open, low-\npressure cavities linked to the glacier snout, while leading\nto closure of the ice around the southeastern part of the\nedifice. Horizontal ice deformation therefore appears to\nhave tipped the balance in favor of intrusive behavior and\nmassive deposits on one side of the edifice and deposition\nby meltwater on the other.\n3.4. Water Depths and Tephra Sedimentology:\nBasalt Versus Rhyolite\n[43] In order for hydroclastic tephra erupted at the early\nstages of a subglacial eruption to be well bedded, it needs to\nbe deposited by eruption-fed density currents, with signif-\nicant transport between the zones of fragmentation and\ndeposition [e.g., White, 2000; Smellie, 2001]. Otherwise,\ntephra deposits will be massive and poorly sorted, with\nevidence for intrusion and quenching of rising magma\nwithin waterlogged tephra [e.g., Schopka et al., 2006]. In\ngeneral, it is found that subglacially erupted tephra deposits\ndirectly overlying pillow lavas tend to be more poorly\nFigure 5. Critical discharge rate for eruptions on a 1.5 km fissure beneath 600 m of ice, plotted together\nwith estimated magma discharge rates (normalized to fissure lengths of 1.5 km) and cavity\nunderpressures for historical basalt fissure eruptions in Iceland, major 20th century subglacial eruptions\nin Iceland and the Pleistocene tindar ridge of Helgafell.

Figure 7 shows the evolving depth\nofmeltwater\/steam above the growing edifice during the early\nphase of a simulated tuya-building eruption beneath 800 m of\nice. A magma discharge rate of 15 m3 s\u00031 was used, which\nis similar to the rates for shield volcano effusion estimated\nby Rossi [1996]. The graph shows that the depth of\nmeltwater above the edifice at the onset of hydroclastic\nfragmentation is very small, due to sluggish melting from\nFigure 6. Simulation of the possible effects of fissure focusing on the style of an eruption beneath 600 m\nof ice with fi = 0.5. The magma discharge rate during the 1973 Heim\u00e6y eruption is indicated, which\nstarted at 500 m3 s\u00031 from a 1.5 km fissure (F) and ended with 10 m3 s\u00031 from a point source (P).\nAlthough the magma discharge rate decreased significantly, it would not have resulted in a change from\nan explosive to an intrusive eruption, as the melting became focused.\nFigure 7. Simulation of the early phase of tuya construction beneath a glacier 650 m thick. Initially, the\ncavity pressure exceeds 5 MPa and pillow lava effusion occurs within a cavity at glaciostatic pressure\nwith almost no meltwater\/steam-filled gap above the edifice. Once the cavity pressure has fallen beneath\n5 MPa, a hydroclastic eruption ensues, with more rapid melting, and the height of meltwater\/steam above\nthe edifice dramatically increases. This would be expected to lead to progressively better stratification\nand sorting in the hydroclastic tephra as the edifice grew.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n11 of 14\nB03203\npillows, but quickly increases once the eruption becomes\nexplosive. The evolving cavity pressure during this simula-\ntion is indicated by the arrow in Figure 2. Thus this is a\npotential explanation for the changes in sedimentary struc-\nture seen in some subglacial successions \u2013 although other\nfactors, such as continuous vs. pulsatory eruptions may also\nplay a role [e.g., Smellie and Hole, 1997; Smellie, 2001]. It\nmust be stressed that this process is relevant to the subgla-\ncial phase of eruptions, and not to prolonged eruptions\nwithin englacial lakes [cf. Werner and Schmincke, 1999].\n[45] Although they have not been as closely studied as\nbasaltic tuyas and their fragmental deposits are less well\nexposed, rhyolitic tuyas appear to be significantly different\nfrom basaltic tuyas, in that the basal pedestal of hydroclastic\ndeposits appears to be entirely massive and unstructured\n[Tuffen et al., 2002b]. The Ho\u00a8skuldsson and Sparks [1997]\nmodel can explain this in terms of pressure changes, with\nthe inevitably positive pressure changes during rhyolitic\neruptions preventing accumulation of meltwater. However,\nas described above, inefficient energy exchange during\nbasaltic eruptions is likely to also lead to meltwater drainage\n[Gu*mundsson et al., 2004]. Further evidence against a\nclosed system comes from the field evidence for meltwater\ndrainage during basaltic and rhyolitic subglacial eruptions\n[e.g., Smellie, 2001; Tuffen et al., 2001; Schopka et al.,\n2006; Smellie, 2006]. Additionally, it is possible for melt-\nwater to pond during rhyolitic eruptions if the bedrock\ntopography is not conducive to drainage [Tuffen et al.,\n2007a]. Therefore an attractive alternative explanation\ncomes from the contrasting water depths that develop\nduring basaltic and rhyolitic eruptions, due to differences\nin the initial magma temperature. Figure 8 shows the\ncontrasting depth of meltwater during fissure eruptions of\nbasaltic and rhyolitic magma, but where all other parameters\nare the same. Far greater water depths develop during\nbasaltic eruptions, consistent with the greater degree of\nbedding and sorting seen in deposits. This is therefore an\nattractive alternative explanation for the contrast between\nrhyolitic and basaltic subglacial tephra deposits.\n4. Discussion: Limitations of the Models and\nScope for Future Work\n[46] Despite the simplifications made, the models appear\nto successfully encapsulate the behavior of subglacial fis-\nsure eruptions in Iceland, and are consistent with the\neruption mechanisms of observed and ancient basaltic\nfissure eruptions. However, many factors have not been\ntaken into account, including the possible influence of\nhorizontal ice flow highlighted by the facies associations\nat Helgafell.\n[47] One obvious factor is the hydraulic gradient around\nthe eruption site, and how this controls patterns of meltwater\nretention, accumulation and pressure. For example, at Gja\u00b4lp\nit appears that the potential gradients controlling meltwater\ndrainage encouraged meltwater to accumulate at the northern\nend of the fissure, where cavity pressures were glaciostatic\nand pillow lavas were emplaced, and drain away from the\nsouthern end of the fissure, favoring the establishment of\nlower pressure conditions and enabling explosive magma-\nwater interaction to occur [Gu*mundsson et al., 2004]. It\nis thus clear that the hydraulic gradient around the\neruption site strongly influences the mechanisms of erup-\ntions. This gradient is controlled by the glacier surface\nand bedrock topography [e.g., Bjo\u00a8rnsson, 1988; Bjo\u00a8rnsson\net al., 2000; Smellie, 2006], unless the eruption occurs so\nclose to the glacier snout that all cavities are only partly\nfilled with meltwater and drainage is controlled by the\nbedrock slope alone [e.g., Syverson et al., 1994]. This\nadded complication to what is already a complexly\ncoupled volcano-ice system makes the application of\npredictive models for the mechanisms of subglacial erup-\ntions all the more problematic. Such models would need\nto consider the hydrological patterns that are unique to\neach potential eruption site and as such would need to be\nFigure 8. Comparison of the height of meltwater\/steam above growing edifices during basaltic and\nrhyolitic eruptions at 100 m3 s\u00031 from a fissure 1.5 km in length beneath 800 m of ice and underpressure\nof 2 MPa. During basaltic eruptions (solid curves) the height of meltwater\/steam quickly rises to over\n100 m, whereas during rhyolitic eruptions (dashed curves) the height rises less rapidly, and then falls as\nthe edifice begins to fill the cavity. As explained in the text, this may account for differences in the\nsedimentology of hydroclastic deposits at basaltic and rhyolitic tuyas.\nB03203 TUFFEN: MODELS OF SUBGLACIAL ERUPTION MECHANISMS\n12 of 14\nB03203\nspecific to each volcano, for which the hydrological\npatterns are known, such as Katla volcano beneath\nMy\u00b4rdalsjo\u00a8kull [Bjo\u00a8rnsson et al., 2000].\n[48] Another crucial element that has not been studied\nhere is the potential coupling between the cavity pressure\nand the magma discharge rate. Coupling is known to occur\nover much longer timescales between glacier thicknesses\nand the eruption rate of basaltic magma in Iceland as a\nwhole [e.g., Jull and McKenzie, 1996], but it may also occur\nduring individual eruptions as the rate and direction of\nmagma rise is controlled by the pressure gradient between\nthe magma chamber and the surface [e.g., Pinel and\nJaupart, 2000; Wilson and Head, 2002]. There is strong\nevidence that pressure release of \u00010.8 MPa during drainage\nof jo\u00a8kulhlaups from the Gr\u0131\u00b4msvo\u00a8tn caldera can trigger\neruptions, as occurred in 1934 [Gu*mundsson, 2005]. In\naddition, Ho\u00a8skuldsson et al. [2006] have suggested that\njo\u00a8kulhlaup drainage may lead to vesiculation of pillow lavas\nand the reactivation of eruptions. The \u2018\u2018transition breccia\u2019\u2019\nthat lies between vesicular pillow lavas and hydroclastic\ndeposits at Kalfstindar [Jones, 1970] may also be attributed\nto sudden pressure decrease during meltwater drainage.\nChanges in cavity pressure during eruptions, which may\nbe triggered by the propagation of a subglacial pressure\nwave [Jo\u00b4hannesson, 2002] or simply the onset of meltwater\ndrainage as connection is established with low-pressure\nsubglacial cavities [e.g., Hooke, 1984], therefore clearly\nhave the potential to drastically affect the magma discharge\nrate during subglacial eruptions as well as the eruption\nmechanism itself. Heated meltwater may also have an\nimportant effect in that it enlarges subglacial drainage\npathways and encourages the establishment of low-pressure\nconditions [e.g., Clarke, 1982]. Studying the degassing\nbehavior of magma in order to reconstruct confining pres-\nsures and the timescales of cooling and meltwater drainage\n[Ho\u00a8skuldsson et al., 2006; Schopka et al., 2006] is therefore\nan important step toward quantifying the coupling between\ncavity pressures, meltwater drainage and eruption mecha-\nnisms, and much work remains to be done in this area. One\npossible implication of this effect is that eruptions may\npreferentially occur in areas of high heat flux, where long-\nlived, low-pressure subglacial cavities exist [Tuffen et al.,\n2002a]. This may occur at silicic volcanic centers with well-\nestablished geothermal fields, such as Torfajo\u00a8kull, Iceland\nor the summit crater of Mount Rainier, Washington, where\nan extensive low-pressure cavity system is melted by\nfumaroles and steam vents [Kiver and Steele, 1975].\nThe effect may be less relevant in basaltic systems\nwhere considerable lateral flow of magma along dikes\noccurs.\n[49] In addition to these complications surrounding the\nrelationship between cavity pressures and magma discharge\nrates, other issues that may be pertinent to the mechanisms\nof subglacial basaltic eruptions include (1) how magma\nvesicularity relates to cavity pressures and degassing during\nmagma ascent, (2) details of how heat is transferred from\nmagma to ice and the temperature of meltwater, and (3) the\nrelative roles of brittle and ductile ice deformation in\nenlarging subglacial cavities. Nonetheless, the models\npresented here do appear to capture important aspects of\nthe behavior of subglacial eruptions and to demonstrate the\ncritical influence that cavity conditions, in particular the\nability of meltwater to interact with rising magma, may\nexert on eruption mechanisms.\n5. Conclusions\n[50] Simplified models of edifice construction and cavity\nevolution during the early phases of subglacial eruptions\nhave been presented. The major conclusions are as follows:\n[51] 1. The magma discharge rate largely determines\nwhether explosive or intrusive eruptions occur, with explo-\nsive eruptions favored by high magma discharge rates. At\nlow magma discharge rates, closure of the ice roof onto the\nedifice may suppress the explosivity and lead to an intrusive\nstyle of eruption.\n[52] 2. Using relevant ice thicknesses, magma discharge\nrates and cavity pressure regimes, the mechanisms of\nhistorical subglacial eruptions in Iceland and a Pleistocene\neruption have been correctly simulated.\n[53] 3. Inferred water column depths during eruptions\nhave been used to explain why subglacial basaltic deposits\nare better stratified than their rhyolitic counterparts, and\nwhy hydroclastic tephra deposits directly overlying pillow\nlavas are generally less well stratified than those higher in\nthe sequence.\n[54] 4. Other factors such as horizontal ice deformation,\ncoupling between cavity pressures and magma discharge\nrate, and the hydraulic gradient around the eruption site may\nalso play important roles in controlling the complex feed-\nback between eruption mechanisms and glacier response.\n[55] Acknowledgments.
