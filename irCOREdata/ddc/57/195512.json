Over the past decade there has been a large amount of interest in these structures,\nmainly due to the potential for applications, for example in quantum information pro-\ncessing and optoelectronic devices. The operating properties of such dot-based devices\ndepend on the form of the bound states of each individual SAQD which, in turn, depend\non the physical dot structure. Recently, STM images of cleaved quantum dots have been\nused to provide detailed physical information on the shape, size and composition profile\nof the dots, while cross-sectional scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (XSTS) may be used\nto image the bound states within individual SAQDs.\nWe simulate an XSTS experiment on a cleaved quantum dot and compare the results to\nreal experimental data. The purpose of this simulation is twofold. First, the experimental\n18nm 18nm\n5nm\nIncGa1-cAs\nGaAs\n0.6nm\nInAs\nA B\n10.6nm10.6nm\nFIGURE 1. Schematic of the dot model investigated by Bruls et al.\ndata can be used to directly test methods for the calculation of the bound states. Second,\nwith a combination of the experimental and simulated results it may be possible to\ndeduce additional information on the physical structure of the dot from that obtained\nwith XSTM and other techniques.\nThe paper is split into two sections. We begin by reporting the first calculation of\nthe bound electronic states inside a cleaved quantum dot, including the full details of\nthe dot deformation and the strain field inside the system. The bound wavefunctions\nare calculated by exact diagonalisation of the single-band, position dependent effective\nmass Hamiltonian in a harmonic oscillator (HO) basis set. In the second section we\nuse the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [2] to relate the calculated wavefunctions to the\ntunnelling currents measured in XSTS experiments. The calculated XSTS images are\nthen compared to experimental data.\nTHE BOUND STATES IN A DEFORMED CLEAVED DOT\nThe dot model\nTo compare directly with the XSTS experiment we use a dot model with dimensions\nand composition identical to those measured by Bruls et al [1] with XSTM. The cal-\nculational methods described in this paper are, however, completely general and may\nbe used to calculate the XSTS signal from cleaved SAQDs of arbitrary shape, size and\ncomposition profile.\nThe uncleaved Bruls dot (shown by the solid and dashed lines in figure 1) is a square\nbased, truncated pyramidal IncGa1 \u0000 cAs dot with an Indium fraction varying linearly\nfrom c \u0001 0 \u0002 6 at the base of the dot to c \u0001 1 at the top of the dot. The SAQD rests on\na 0.6nm InAs wetting layer and is surrounded by a GaAs matrix. The GaAs cap and\nsubstrate have height 30 nm. The origin of our coordinate system is chosen to be at the\ncentre of the uncleaved IncGa1 \u0000 cAs dot. The z axis is taken to be in the growth direction\nand the y direction is perpendicular to the dot\/vacuum interface.\nThe SAQD is cleaved along the line AB in figure 1 exposing a cross-section through\nthe dot. After cleaving, the remaining part of the dot (shown by the solid line in figure\n1) relaxes, and deforms outward into the vacuum. We model this deformation and\ncalculate the strain field throughout the deformed dot within the continuum elasticity\napproximation. This is done with a commercially available, finite element package,\n-20\n0\n20x (nm) -10 0 10\nz (nm)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\ndeformation (nm)\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0 5 10 15 20\nV\n (e\nV)\ny (nm)\nFIGURE 2.

Right: Strained electron confinement\npotential in the cleaved dot (solid line) compared to the confinement potential in an uncleaved dot (dashed\nline). Energies are given relative to the GaAs conduction band edge.\nAbaqus, which has already been shown to provide an accurate representation of the\nstrain within a cleaved dot [1]. The strain field affects the band gaps in the dot and\nsubstrate material and hence alters the electron confinement potential, V\n\u0000\nr \u0001 \u0001 Vo\n\u0000\nr \u0001\u0003\u0002\nVc\n\u0000\nr \u0001 . The conduction band offset, Vo, is taken to be 0.797 eV between InAs and\nGaAs, while the potential step at the dot vacuum interface is set from the electron\naffinity of GaAs at 4.07 eV above the GaAs conduction band edge. In the IncGa1 \u0000 cAs\nmaterial Vo \u0001\u0005\u0004 1 \u0002 178c \u0002 0 \u0002 381c2 [3]. The relation between the strain contribution to the\nconfinement potential, Vc\n\u0000\nr \u0001 , and the strain is well documented in the literature [5].\nFigure 2 shows the calculated deformation of the dot\/substrate system after cleaving.\nThe originally highly strained dot and wetting layer regions relax outward into the\nvacuum in order to minimise the strain energy. The right hand figure shows the calculated\nV\n\u0000\nr \u0001 relative to the GaAs conduction band edge. This is much deeper in the cleaved dot\n(solid line) at the dot\/vacuum interface because the material that has deformed outward\nis less strained than that in the centre of the uncleaved dot (dotted line).\nThe position dependent effective masses in the semiconductor material are also af-\nfected by the strain field. We take the bulk effective masses in GaAs, InAs and the\nvacuum to be 0.067 mo, 0.023 mo and mo respectively and calculate the effective mass in\nthe IncGa1 \u0000 cAs material by linear interpolation. The strained effective masses are then\ncalculated with first order perturbation theory [5]. Finally, for this particular cleaved dot\nwith an exposed (110) surface, we assume flat bands at the dot\/vacuum interface, as\nthere are no (110) surface states within the bulk band gap [7].\nCalculation method\nTo calculate the bound energy levels and the electron wavefunctions we use the single-\nband effective mass approximation to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u0006\n\u0004 h\u00af2\n2\n\u2207M \u0000 1\u2207 \u0002 V\n\u0000\nr \u0001 \u0007 \u03a8 \u0001 E\u03a8 \b (1)\nwhere M is the effective mass tensor. We have not yet included the effect of the piezo-\nelectric potential as we expect its effect on the shape of the bound states inside the\ncleaved dot to be small [4].\nGiven the position dependent confinement potentials and effective masses we solve\nequation (1) by expanding the exact wavefunction, \u03a8dot , as a sum of HO functions and\nthen diagonalising the resultant Hamiltonian matrix.

The length scales and the offset parameter, zo, can be chosen\nto optimise the rate of convergence of the HO calculation. We choose values of \u03bbr,\n\u03bbz and zo to give the ground harmonic oscillator basis function a similar spatial extent\nto the actual localised state within the dot. For the particular cleaved dot investigated,\nthe values used are: \u03c9o \u0001 0 \u0002 64 eV, \u03c9z \u0001 0 \u0002 54 eV, zo \u0001 0 \u0002 08 nm. We can also alter the\nposition of the dot\/vacuum interface with respect to the origin of the HO functions. With\nthe values of the parameters chosen, the best convergence is obtained by off-setting the\ninterface by 3 nm in the y direction. This places the maximum in the HO ground state at\nthe approximate position of the maximum in the actual ground state of the dot.\nTo diagonalise the Hamiltonian and solve for the exact single particle states we must\ncalculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operator (from eqn.

Further details on the calculation method used are reported elsewhere [6].\nOnce the individual matrix elements have been calculated we diagonalise the Hamil-\ntonian with the LAPACK library standard linear algebra routines. We optimise the com-\nputer time for the calculation by using the reflection symmetry of the cleaved dot to\nblock diagonalise the Hamiltonian into 2 blocks. Each block may then be diagonalised\nseparately reducing the total time needed for the diagonalisation by a factor of 4.\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 1012\n|\u03a8|\n2  \n(ar\nbit\nrar\ny u\nnit\ns)\ny (nm)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6\n|\u03a8|\n2  \n(ar\nbit\nrar\ny u\nnit\ns)\nz (nm)\nFIGURE 3. Comparison between the ground state charge densities in the cleaved dot (solid line) and\noriginal dot (dashed line). Left: variation in the charge density with y at x \u0000 0 and z \u0000 0. Right: variation\nin the charge density with z at x \u0000 0 and y \u0000 2 \u0001 8 nm.\nResults\nWith 21168 HO functions in the expansion of the cleaved dot wavefunctions, we find\n4 bound states within the dot at -0.272 eV, -0.175 eV, -0.102 eV and -0.072 eV. These\nenergies are converged roughly to within 0.5 meV of the exact bound state energies.\nTo obtain results within 1% of the true energies we still need to include approximately\n10000 states in the expansion. This compares unfavourably with a calculation of the\nstates of the original uncleaved dot in which the convergence of the calculation with a\nHO basis set is rapid: The ground state energy in the uncleaved dot (-0.225 eV) can be\nconverged to within 1% with only 24 HO functions [6]. This indicates that HO functions\nare not the optimum basis for investigating this particular system.\nThe unintuitive result that the ground state is more tightly bound in the cleaved dot\nis explained by the deepening of the potential due to the deformation of the dot into\nthe vacuum (see figure 2). The shape of V \u0000 r \u0001 also explains the poor convergence. It\nis energetically favourable for the maximum in the charge density to be close to the\ndot\/vacuum interface where the potential is deepest, however the energies of the bound\nstates are sensitive to the tails of the wavefunctions extending into the vacuum. This\nbehaviour can be seen by examining the charge density (figure 3). The maximum in the\nground state charge density is at x \u0001 0 and z \u0001 0 at the centre of the dot, but at y \u0001 2 \u0002 8\nnm. This is closer to the interface than was expected before a detailed calculation of the\nconfinement potential in the deformed cleaved SAQD (see figure 2). The left hand plot\nof figure 3 shows this behaviour: The charge density is appreciable at the edge of the\ndot but then decays abruptly into the vacuum region. In comparison, the charge density\nin the uncleaved dot shows a much smoother variation with y. From the right hand plot\nwe can see that the charge density in the cleaved dot is slightly more symmetric about\nz \u0001 0, than in the original dot. This is because the deformation of the dot tends to even\nout the variations in strain as a function of z.\nFigure 4 shows the variation of the bound state charge densities in the xz plane. The\nexcited states all have nodes in the x direction. States 2 and 3 also have nodes in the y\ndirection. The wavefunctions inside the cleaved SAQD are very different to those in the\noriginal dot.

At low VB the\nelectrons tunnel from the tip into the 0D bound states of the dot. By scanning the STM\ntip over the exposed surface of the cleaved dot the spatial variation in tunnelling current\ncan be measured, this is related to the spatial variation of the bound states inside the dot.\nThe measured current, I, is directly proportional to the tunnelling probability between\nthe tip and dot states. In the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [2] we approximate the tip\nwavefunction by a decaying spherical wave, then,\nI \u0000 \u2211\nn\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u000e \u03a8dotn\nexp\n\u0000\n\u0004 ktip \f r \u0004 rtip \f \u0001\n\f r \u0004 rtip \f\ndr\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\nftip\n\u0000\nE f \u0002 En \u0001 gtip\n\u0000\nE f \u0002 En \u0001 \u0002 (5)\nWhere \u03a8dotn is the nth excited state of the cleaved dot, of energy En.

To obtain equation (5) we have assumed the\ndot states are unoccupied and used the fact the 0D bound states have a delta function\ndensity of states. The actual and simulated experiments were performed at room tem-\nperature, which we assume to be 290K. Altering the tip bias voltage experimentally is\nequivalent to altering the position of the tip Fermi level, E f in this model. E f is measured\nrelative to the ground state of the dot. At low VB, or alternatively, low E f , the tunnelling\nis directly into the dot ground state. As E f is increased the total observed current picks\nup contributions in turn from tunnelling into each of the excited states of the dot.\nIn this approximation, the tip wavefunction decays rapidly away from the position\nof the STM tip. This makes the calculated tunnelling current sensitive to the tails of\nthe bound states extending into the vacuum. In this area, where the magnitude of the\nwavefunctions are small, there is a significant amount of noise in the calculated results.\nTo average out some of the noise, we impose a muffin tin radius of 0.5 nm around the\ntip in which we assume the tip wavefunction to be constant. Physically this corresponds\nto the dimensions of the STM tip. In a more accurate model we could solve for the\nwavefunctions inside this region, possibly as an expansion of spherical Bessel functions.\nIn this model we ignore the tip induced band bending. Calculations with a 1D model\nindicate that the band bending over the region of the dot can be approximated by a\nconstant offset in the band edges. This has no effect on the charge densities, but makes\nthe relation between E f and the experimentally applied bias voltage unclear.\nResults\nIn both the experimental and simulated XSTS scans the STM tip is scanned parallel\nto the deformed dot surface at a distance of 0.6nm from the exposed surface. In this\npaper we compare calculated results with experimental line scans along x at z \u0001 0\nmeasured at two different bias voltages. To directly compare the experiment and theory\nwe have scaled each of the calculated tunnelling currents by a constant factor and added a\nconstant background. In general, as E f is increased we see an evolution in the calculated\nXSTS signals similar to that observed experimentally as VB is raised.\nOn the left hand side of figure 5 we can see that the experimental and calculated\ntunnelling currents have similar shape when the tunnelling is primarily into the dot\nground state. The experimental FWHM is 9.9 \u0000 0.9 nm, compared to a calculated result\nof 11.1 nm. The broad shoulders on the calculated curve come from the contribution to\nthe signal from tunnelling into the 1st excited state within the dot.\nAt larger VB (right hand side of figure 5) we also obtain similar results to the experi-\nmental scans. The separation between the lobes of the charge density is approximately\n11.7 nm (experimental) and 11.1 (calculated). The separation between the minima in the\ncharge density is approximately 9.3 nm (experimental) and 7.7 (calculated). The ratio\nbetween the heights of the central peak and the lobes is similar in both cases.\nIn conclusion, we have described a method for interpreting the results of XSTS\nmeasurements based on the calculated electron wavefunctions within cleaved SAQDs\nin which the qualitative agreement between experiment and theory is promising. By\nincluding such effects as the tip induced band bending, the position dependence of ktip,\nand the piezoelectric potential in this model, we may be able to obtain better quantitative\nagreement with experiment. The experimental scans can then be fitted with different dot\nmodels to obtain additional information on the physical structure of the dot.\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0 5 10 15 20\nx (nm)\nI (nA)\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nx (nm)\nI (nA)\n\u0000\nFIGURE 5.
