Direct \nmeasurement of this efficiency factor is now possible, and could be used to \ncompare the relative efficiencies of insect flight across the class.  Here we use \nDigital Particle Image Velocimetry to measure the instantaneous downwash \ndistribution, mid-downstroke, of a tethered desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria).  \nBy integrating the downwash distribution, we are thereby able to provide the \nfirst direct empirical measurement of k for an insect. The measured value of \nk=1.12 corresponds reasonably well with that predicted by previous theoretical \nstudies. \n \nKey words: Flow visualisation, wake, downwash, Schistocerca gregaria, DPIV, \naerodynamics, actuator disc, flapping wing, aerofoil. \n \nIntroduction \nTo date, several estimates have been made of the aerodynamic force production of \nflying insects by regarding their stroke plane as an actuator disc, which is considered \n\u2018pulsed\u2019 if the upstroke is inactive (Ellington, 1984a; Ellington, 1984b; Rayner, 1979).  \nActuator disc models, derived from propeller theory, are concerned solely with the \nvertical momentum imparted to the air flowing through the disc, and therefore can \ndisregard detail of wing kinematics, wing shape, and the specific details of the wing\u2019s \ninteraction with the air.  This has been a useful simplification but suffers from many \nlimiting assumptions, including the most basic one that the disc imparts a uniform \ndownward acceleration to the fluid across its entire area.  Only ideal (i.e. theoretical) \n2 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \npropellers or wings have uniform downwash distributions.  Real propellers have a \nspecific non-uniformity in downwash across the disc, which is caused by several \nfactors. These include losses due to wingtip vortices, wing root vortices, possible \nreductions in downwash close to the hub, and variations in downwash due to changes \nin wing twist or planform.  Deviations from a uniform downwash velocity profile \ncause inefficiency. The force generated by the actuator disc equals the rate of change \nof momentum of the air accelerated through the disc, given by mv\/t (where m is the \nmass of air being accelerated to a velocity, v, in unit time, t). A uniformly loaded \nactuator disc accelerates the entire mass of air swept by the wings to a uniform \nvelocity. Any other loading distribution giving the same total change in momentum \nmust require higher velocities over some part of the disc, but in the actuator disc \nmodel the kinetic energy lost to the wake is given by mv2\/2. Because of the v2 term, \nkinetic energy losses due to these higher velocities are more detrimental than any \nbenefits from lower velocities elsewhere on the disc. A uniform downwash across the \ndisc therefore provides the lowest kinetic energy lost to the wake for a given force \nproduction, and the highest efficiency.  \nTo compensate for the inefficiency caused by an uneven application of pressure, a \ncorrection factor, k, is used to modify existing actuator disc models: k is defined as the \nratio of actual induced power to ideal induced power for a given thrust. Hence, for an \nideal actuator disc, k=1, while any departure from ideal efficiency gives k>1. Without \nany specific knowledge of the downwash distribution across the wing disc of any \ninsect, values of k>1 have been selected so as to fit the difference between the ideal \npower required for any given thrust, and estimates of the induced power which is \nactually required to produce that thrust (based on muscle masses, muscle efficiencies \nand metabolic rates \u2013 e.g. Dudley and Ellington, 1990). Fundamentally, however, k is \n3 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \na correction factor for the departure of the actual downwash velocity profile from the \nideal, uniform profile, and is therefore amenable to direct aerodynamic measurement \nusing Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). Here we present the first downwash \nvelocity profile data measured directly from a flying tethered insect and use it to \nprovide a direct empirical estimate of k for a desert locust. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nDesert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria Forsk\u00e5l, were obtained from a captive bred \npopulation, and selected for physical characteristics indicative of health (good wing \ncondition, strong free-flight ability, etc.). Data presented here were collected during a \ntwo-hour bout of flight from a single male individual weighing 1.21g, with a wing \nlength of 49mm and a thorax width of 14mm. The locust was rigidly tethered in a \nwind tunnel at a body angle of 7\u00b0 (the angle from the horizontal to the ventral surface \nof the thorax; for further details see Taylor and Thomas, 2003), a value previously \nshown to stimulate tethered flight with lift balancing body weight ( Weis-Fogh, \n1956a; Weis-Fogh, 1956b; Wortmann and Zarnack, 1993; Zarnack and Wortmann, \n1989; Taylor and Thomas, 2003), and also consistent with the body angles adopted by \nfree-flying locusts in the wild (Schistocerca gregaria: (Waloff, 1972); Locusta \nmigratoria: (Baker et al., 1981)). Tethering also allowed manipulation of the locust \nrelative to the laser sheet such that DPIV could be used to measure the induced flow \nat a series of stations from the body centreline out along the wing. Measurements \nwere performed in a low-speed, low-turbulence wind tunnel (1.0\u00d70.5\u00d70.5m working \n4 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nsection) at 3.50ms-1 under the same experimental conditions and using the same \ntechniques as outlined in Bomphrey et al. (Bomphrey et al., 2005).   \nTwo-dimensional DPIV uses a double-pulsed laser sheet to illuminate seeding \nparticles in the plane of interest, and a digital camera to record an image pair from that \nplane (Adrian, 1991).  Cross-correlation techniques are then applied to sequential \npairs of DPIV images across an interrogation region grid to obtain the statistically \ndominant particle movement at each grid point. From the particle displacements, an \ninstantaneous velocity is obtained from each grid point to yield high-resolution planar \ninstantaneous vector maps of flow velocity and vorticity.  Seventy-three image pairs \n(limited by data storage) were recorded yielding seventy-three corresponding vector \nmaps for each of nine positions along one wing. In the set-up used here, a JEM \nHydrosonic 2000 seeder with \u2018long lasting\u2019 smoke fluid was used to produce seeding \nwith a mean particle diameter of less than 10\u00b5m. A pulsed New Wave Gemini Nd-\nYAG laser (120mJ per 5ns pulse), combined with plano-concave and plano-\ncylindrical lenses (focal lengths \u201350mm and 75mm) produced a 0.5mm thick light \nsheet oriented vertically across the imaging area. The laser was synchronised with a \ndouble frame digital camera (Kodak ES1.0 digital CCD 10002 pixels) to record image \npairs at 15Hz (a little slower than the 19Hz wingbeat frequency of the locust). The \npulse separation interval was optimised at 120\u00b5s for 3.50ms-1 freestream velocity, to \nretain sufficient seeding particles within the light sheet. The vertically aligned light \nsheet was centred in the working section of the wind tunnel and a racked traverse \nmoved the insect mount perpendicular to the light sheet to illuminate various vertical \nand chordwise planes at stations across the wingspan.  Dantec FlowManager software \nwas used to control the camera and laser for DPIV data acquisition. DPIV images \n5 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nwere processed using TSI UltraPIV Insight software incorporating the Hart Algorithm \n(Hart, 2000). \nAt each spanwise position the peak value of downwash was measured as close to the \ntrailing edge as possible without being affected by data dropout due to glare on the \ntrailing edge.  Here, the downwash will be defined as w, the velocity component \nparallel to the vertical axis, z, with w>0 being upwards, against gravity, g. The x-axis \nwill be defined as that aligned with the freestream, and the y-axis as the third \northogonal axis. To ensure as accurate a measurement as possible, we took the peak \ndownwash close to the trailing edge of the wing as representing the highest deflection \nof the flow as a result of the geometry and kinematics of that section of wing.  In \norder to be confident of measuring the peak downwash, w was sampled in a transect \napproximately perpendicular to the path of the wing, centred on the trailing edge. For \nconsistency frame-to-frame and wingbeat-to-wingbeat, the transect was set at an angle \nof 45\u00b0 to the vertical \u2013 in other words, the transect was a line at 45\u00b0 in the x-z plane, \nas illuminated by the laser sheet (Fig. 1). Measuring peak negative w within this \ntransect should yield the peak downwash behind the trailing edge of the wing. The \ntransect length was selected to be sufficient to record the peak negative w, and the \ndecay away from that peak with distance along the transect \u2013 see inset of Fig. 1. \n \nAnalysis \nWings generate lift by imparting linear momentum to the fluid through which they \npass. The lift developed is equal to the rate of flux of vertical momentum through a \nvertical (y-z)  plane in the distant wake, far enough from the wing that the pressure \n6 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nequals that of the surrounding fluid. The induced velocity increases, and (for an even \ndownwash) eventually doubles, as the pressure equilibrates downstream of the wing \n(Stepniewski & Keys, 1984). Knowledge of the instantaneous downwash in the \nvicinity of the wing is therefore sufficient to determine the instantaneous lift if the \nmass flow characteristics of the wing are also known and it is assumed that the local \ndownwash velocities double in the far wake. \n \nAn actuator disc model for the case of horizontal flight has been proposed by \nStepniewski & Keys (1984), and actuator disc models in general have since been \nadopted as a standard model by the animal flight community (e.g. Chai, 1997; \nEllington, 1984). Beyond the fundamental simplifying assumptions common to all \nactuator disc theories, the model is formulated through a heuristic argument in which \nit is assumed that the horizontal actuator disc is rotated into the vertical plane far \ndownstream of the wing (Fig. 2), equivalent to the Trefftz plane in classical wing \ntheory (Fig. 2). The mass flow through the disc is therefore 42bV\u03c0\u03c1 , where \u03c1 is the \ndensity of the fluid and V is the freestream velocity.  \n \nIt is well known that induced drag is minimised when the downwash velocity at the \nwing (w) is constant across the span (Munk, 1921). Assuming an even downwash, the \ntotal lift on the wing is therefore: \n \nL = \u03c1 \u03c0b\n2\n2\nVw .         (1) \n \nand the total induced power is simply: \n7 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \n \nPideal = \u03c1 \u03c0b\n2\n2\nVw2 .         (2) \n  \nThese results are identical to the results of lifting line theory if an elliptic spanwise \nloading distribution is assumed. In this particular case, the potential flow in a vertical \nplane in the far wake is equivalent to that of a flat plate of the same span (b) as the \nwing moving downward with normal velocity 2w, and the potential flow solution for a \nflat plate shows that the apparent mass accelerated is equal to the mass of a circular \ncylinder of fluid having the plate\u2019s span as its diameter. The wing can therefore be \nthought of as deflecting a circular jet of diameter b downward with velocity 2w \n(Jones, 1990), and the lifting line theory therefore arrives at the same results as \nStepniewski & Keys\u2019 actuator disc model. This suggests that the exact area physically \nswept by the wings may not be of fundamental importance in determining the forces \ngenerated and the power required to do so, provided that the flow may be treated as \npotential and quasi-steady, and provided that the downwash is approximately even.  \n \nLifting line theory gives different results if the downwash distribution is uneven, and \nthe equivalence to the model of Stepneiwski & Keys is then lost. Nevertheless, for \nsmall deviations from an even downwash, we may reasonably assume that the wings \nstill encounter a circular jet of diameter b, and we may continue to argue that the exact \narea physically swept by the wings is not of fundamental importance to the forces \ngenerated. In any case, assuming that the wings continue to impart momentum to a \nhorizontal circular disc of diameter b moving horizontally with velocity V, the \nelemental contributions to lift and induced power across the span may be written: \n \n8 \nR.

The empirical data were well \napproximated by a cosine series with three harmonics (Fig. 3A): \n \nw \u03b8( )= an cos n\u03b8(\nn=0\n3\u2211 )         (9) \n \nwhich we fitted as a general linear model, using the \u201cglmfit\u201d function in Matlab 7.0.4 \n(The MathWorks Inc., 2005). All of the fitted coefficients were highly significant \n(p<0.01) and the model explained 91% of the total variance in the downwash \nmeasurements (Table 1).  \n \n10 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nThe spanwise loading distribution, dL(y), (Fig. 3B) can be calculated by substituting \nthe empirically fitted downwash distribution, w(\u03b8), from Eqn. 9 into Eqn. 3, making \nuse of the identity in Eqn. 7. Integrating across the span gives an instantaneous total \nlift of 0.11N, which is around ten times the locust\u2019s body weight. Although the \ninstantaneous lift peaks at this point in the wingbeat, this estimate is clearly too high, \nand suggests that the model overestimates the total mass of fluid accelerated by the \nwings. Errors in the total apparent mass cancel in calculating the dimensionless \nefficiency factor k, however, and provided the relative mass of air accelerated at each \nspanwise station is reasonably approximated by the circular distribution assumed, the \ncalculated value of k should also be reasonable. \n \nIn order to calculate the efficiency factor k, we integrated Eq. 8 numerically in \nMathematica 5.1 (Wolfram Research Inc., 2004). This gave k=1.12 for the fitted \nvalues of the coefficients an in Table 1. We then used the standard errors of the \ncoefficients in Table 1 to perform a Monte Carlo analysis on the error in our estimate \nof k, drawing 10,000 sets of values for the coefficients from t-distributed populations \n(d.f.=23), and evaluating Eq. 8 for each of the 10,000 sets. The resulting sample of \nestimates of k is plotted as a histogram of relative frequency in Fig. 4A. We then used \nthe upper and lower 2.5% percentiles of this sample to construct a 95% confidence \ninterval for k (1.07, 1.22).  \n \nIt is clear from Fig. 3A that the confidence interval for the downwash distribution is \nrather wide in the region between the sagittal plane of the locust and the most \nproximal of the spanwise stations at which the downwash was measured. Since we \nwere prevented from obtaining information on the downwash in this region by the \n11 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \npresence of the body, we decided to evaluate k over only the portion of the downwash \ndistribution distal to the spanwise station of the most proximal downwash \nmeasurements (\u03b8root ). This requires some adjustment to the integrals, and we therefore \ndefine a modified efficiency factor \u2032k  evaluated over this integral as: \n \n\u2032k =\n\u03c0 2 \u2212\u03b8 2\n\u03b8root\n\u03c0\n\u222b d\u03b8 w2 \u03b8( ) \u03c0 2 \u2212\u03b8 2\n\u03b8root\n\u03c0\n\u222b d\u03b8\nw \u03b8( ) \u03c0 2 \u2212\u03b8 2\n\u03b8root\n\u03c0\n\u222b d\u03b8\u23a1\u23a3\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a4\n\u23a6\n\u23a5\u23a5\n2  \n(10) \ngiven bi-lateral symmetry. \n \nWe repeated the procedure described above for calculating k and its error for \u2032k , \nyielding a modified efficiency factor \u2032k =1.18, with 95% confidence interval \n(1.10,1.33; Fig. 4B). Removing this central portion of the wing also yields a more \nreasonable estimate of the total instantaneous lift (0.07N). \n \nDiscussion \nThe result of this experiment, k=1.12 or \u2032k =1.18, is a little lower than estimates used \nin other studies (Ellington, 1984a; Spedding and Pennycuick, 2001; Tytell and \nEllington, 2003; Usherwood and Ellington, 2002) suggesting that despite mechanical \nand evolutionary constraints locust wings are rather efficient, indeed, only 12-18% \nless that ideally efficient. It is a little higher than that measured by Spedding (1987) \nfor a gliding kestrel where k=1\/e, and e=0.96 so k=1.04.  Spedding derived this figure \n12 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nfrom the ratio of wingtip vortex spacing to the spacing predicted for an elliptically \nloaded wing of the same wingspan.  The assumption of elliptical loading could give \nrise to this value being lower than ours, although it may also be due to the fingered \nwingtips of kestrels. The models differ in that the one presented here does not rely on \nthe assumption of an even downwash across the span.  That e=1 is a minimum, \nachieved only by elliptically loaded planar wings does not mean that kestrels should \nnot be able to have values lower than unity. Values of e>1 are possible, for example, \nwith disruption of the wingtip vortex by winglets of different types, in particular any \nbranching of the tips, which has the effect of a bi-plane, tri-plane, or more at the \nextremity of the wing.  The total instantaneous estimate for lift (up to ten times \nbodyweight) is probably unrealistically high, yet this is not a limitation of this \nexperiment because the errors included in the estimation of added mass cancel during \ncalculation of k.  That the figure is too high should perhaps act as a cautionary note to \nthose pursuing the actuator disc model in order to determine total flight forces. \nThis experiment was limited in that it could only measure the downwash at one point \nthrough the wingbeat cycle of a tethered locust.  A fuller account of the downwash, \nwith its changing magnitude and distribution for a variety of insects, preferably in \nfree-flight, is planned next to help provide a more realistic model of insect flight.  If \nwe are to measure and compare the differences between species, then a standard \nreference position is required to permit unambiguous comparisons. Here we have \nselected the position with the wings held 180\u00b0 apart (taking the larger pair of wings \nfor functionally four-winged insects).  This position has a number of advantages. \nFirstly, it occurs in the middle of the wing stroke for almost all insects, so variations \ndue to wing accelerations or rotations are unlikely to dominate the flows. Secondly, it \nmaximises wing span, easing problems of resolution. Thirdly, because the wings are \n13 \nR. J. Bomphrey et al.            Measuring the downwash distribution behind a locust \nessentially horizontal at this point in the stroke modelling the flow is simplified. \nVariations in insect wing design are spectacular, but we know almost nothing about \nthe aerodynamic effects of those variations, or the evolutionary selection pressures \nthat have lead to them. A comparative DPIV approach of this nature would allow the \ndefinition of similarities in design, leading to groupings of aerodynamic solutions, \nwhich are conserved despite compromises enforced by other evolutionary selective \npressures.   \nNo insect wing can be ideally loaded: most insects have simple quasi-planar wing \ngeometry (unlike birds with their branching, fingered wingtips), so aerodynamic \ninefficiencies are inevitable, thus increasing the required induced power to stay aloft, \nand consequently raising k to a value above the ideal of unity.  Evolutionary biologists \nwould like to discover whether the wings of each flying insect have at least a close to \nlocally optimal design in terms of aerodynamics.  Measuring the downwash \ndistribution can provide new insights into insect wing design by revealing how the \ncombination of aerodynamic mechanisms and wing architecture are employed to keep \nk as low as possible.  It is not a surprise for a migratory species such as Schistocerca \ngregaria to maximise flight efficiency, and it would be of interest to compare this \nresult with measurements from insects with differing flight morphologies. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful comments of the referees which improved this \nmanuscript.
