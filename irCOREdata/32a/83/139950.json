When choosing which secondary school they wish their\nchildren to attend, parents will be aware of the school\u2019s performance in\nKey Stage 3, GCSE and A- level examinations. We suggest that GCSE\nexamination results will be the measure of school performance that\nparental choice will be most closely correlated with. Therefore,\nsecondary schools with good GCSE examination results will be\n\u2018oversubscribed\u2019 in that more students will wish to attend these schools\nthan there are places available. Schools will then have to develop\nmechanisms for rationing the available places - central to rationing\nstrategies in English schools at the moment is geographical proximity of\nthe family home to the school of choice. Parents will thus have a strong\nincentive to purchase houses in the \u2018catchment\u2019 area of high performing\nschools. Our results suggest that this is the case, with high performing\nschools stimulating a price premium in local residential property markets\nof between 1% and 3% for each additional 10% point improvement in the\npass rate in GCSE examinations.\nKeywords: Hedonic, capitalisation of school performance, property\nprices.\nJEL Classification: R23, R53, and I20.\n1. Introduction\nStephen Gibbons and Stephen Machin (2008) state that anecdotal\nevidence, media reports, and even dinner party discussions lend credence\nto the claim that good schools raise local house prices. The capitalisation\nof school performance into local property values has been the subject of a\nnumber of studies in the US and latterly in the UK. Typically, these\nstudies have been cross-sectional and have found a positive relationship\nbetween a chosen measure of standardised student test scores\nperformance and local residential property values.\nThe 1988 Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum into\nEnglish schools and legislated for the provision of testing of school\n3children at ages 7, 11 and 14 at the end of Key Stages 1, 2 and 3\nrespectively. Students would then typically complete GCSE (General\nCertificate of Secondary Education) examinations at the end of Key Stage\n4, aged 16. The Act placed a focus on measuring the outputs of state-\nfunded education in England at the end of all four Key Stages. This\nreflected a general concern on the part of those legislating to provide\noutputs from the state education system which would equip the UK labour\nforce with the skills, knowledge and competencies necessary to drive\neconomic growth in an increasingly competitive global economy (Tom\nElkins and John Elliott, 2004).\nThe introduction of testing of school pupils at ages 7, 11 and 14, as well\nas public examinations at GCSE and A-level (at age 18), has provided a\nwealth of information on the performance of school children at specific\nstages of their school lives. In addition, the formal inspection of schools\nby OFSTED (Office for Standards in Education) has provided additional\ndetailed information on the performance of children, teaching staff and\nmanagement in state-funded schools. This has given parents a plethora of\ndata upon which to assess the performance of schools. Furthermore, these\ndata are readily available to parents at the Department for Children,\nSchools and Families (DCSF) web site.\nThe single measure of school performance employed in this paper is the\npercentage of students gaining five or more GCSE passes at grades A* -\nC in any one year. Full performance results (discussed later) are\npublished each year by the DCSF (now referred to as the Department for\nEducation). It is reasonable to suggest, by implication, that good school\nperformance will enhance future job possibilities. However, this\nparticular relationship is outside the scope of this study.\nThis paper is concerned with the impact of state-funded secondary school\nperformance on house prices in the owner-occupied sector in seven major\ncities\/urban conurbations in England \u2013 Greater London, Birmingham,\nBristol, Leeds, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. State-\nfunded schools account for well over 90% of the total student population\n(see Chris Ryan and Luke Sibieta, 2010) while owner-occupied housing\nrepresents 87% of all properties (see Kathleen Scanlon and Christine\nWhitehead, 2004). These cities have been selected on the basis of\ngeographical diversity and because they represent some of the largest\nconurbations in England.\n4The cities are analysed separately because we wish to allow for the fact\nthat housing markets in different parts of the country may capitalise\nschool performance to a different extent. For a discussion and justification\nof this approach involving segmentation of the database into a number of\nmetropolitan areas see David M Brasington and Diane Hite (2005).\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: the next section provides a review\nof the literature on the capitalisation of school performance into\nresidential property prices, focusing on the so-called hedonic approach to\nmeasurement (the methodology adopted in this study). Section 3\ndescribes the data employed and the main procedures adopted to render it\nsuitable for statistical analysis. Section 4 outlines the modelling\nframework adopted, while Section 5 discusses the main empirical results.\nFinally, Section 6 draws together the main conclusions and findings.\n2. Literature Review\nThe value which parents place on good school performance would be\neasy to assess if education services were sold in a free and competitive\nmarket. However, since there is no observable market price for state-\nprovided schooling, an indirect method must be found to place a\nmonetary value on the services provided by state-funded schools.\nThe hypothesis we are proposing in this paper is that, ceteris paribus, a\nhigher level of school performance will be capitalised into higher\nproperty values. In other words, parents wishing to gain access to schools\nwith a superior academic performance will bid up the price of properties\nwhich are most geographically proximate to a high performing school.\nThey will do this in order to ensure that their children are in the\ncatchment area of the high performing\/oversubscribed school and are\ntherefore eligible for entry into that school (for a general discussion of the\ncapitalisation of spatially differentiated environmental amenities \u2013 as in\nthis study involving property prices, neighbourhood characteristics and\nschool performance \u2013 see Sherwin Rosen (1974) and Roland Benabou\n(1996)).\nIn reviewing the literature related to this study we are mindful of three\nkey issues. The first is concerned with the question of what parents are\nimplicitly purchasing when they buy a house proximate to a high\nperforming school; that is, what is the most appropriate measure of \u2018good\u2019\n5school performance? Secondly, what conditions are necessary in a local\nhousing market for \u2018good school performance\u2019 to be capitalised into\nresidential property prices? Finally, what are the methodological issues\nfaced by researchers attempting to model such a relationship?\nA body of literature has focused on what parents are buying when they\nselect schools for their children. In this context Thomas A Downes and\nJeffrey E Zabel (2002) in their study of the impact of school\ncharacteristics on house prices in Chicago found that homeowners paid\nattention to school outputs, i.e. test scores, and not inputs in the form of\nper pupil expenditures by schooling authorities. David M Brasington and\nDonald R Haurin (2006) examined the extent to which homeowners\nvalued traditional measures of school performance (absolute test scores)\nof which the UK\u2019s GCSE examination pass rates are an example. These\ntraditional measures contrast with the relatively new value-added\nmeasures of school quality, which attempt to measure the capability of\nstudents as they enter the secondary schooling process and compare this\nwith the test scores on exit, the difference between the two being the\nvalue added. With this approach it is the measure of value added which\nacts as a measure of school quality rather than the absolute performance at\nthe end of the process.\nWhilst educationalists may argue that the value-added approach\nrepresents a much more effective evaluation of school performance,\nBrasington and Haurin (2006) report that homeowners value average test\nscores and levels of expenditure on education above any measure of\nstudent value-added when assessing local school performance. They\nargue, therefore, that it is average test scores which are capitalised into\nlocal property prices rather than value-added measures of school\nperformance.\nIn relation to what conditions must exist in the local housing market for\ngood school performance capitalisation to occur David A Starrett (1981),\nDavid E Wildasin (1987), William H Hoyt (1999) and Christian A L\nHilber and Christopher C J Mayer (2002) all argue that where there is a\nrelatively inelastic supply of housing, land and house prices will rise in\nthose areas which provide relatively more attractive amenities, to the\npoint where the additional price paid reflects the perceived additional\nvalue of high-quality local amenities. The capitalisation of local amenities\nand neighbourhood effects into residential property values has been\n6widely researched in the USA. Brasington (2002) provides a thorough\noverview of the capitalisation debate, the key point being that\ncapitalisation of any differential in local amenity is contingent upon a\nsupply of housing which is inelastic with respect to price. However, Paul\nCheshire and Stephen C Sheppard (2004) challenge this view and argue\ninstead that differences in housing supply elasticities do not imply\ndifferent levels of capitalisation. In particular, they point out that \u2018it is\npossible that observed reductions in capitalisation might exist for other\nreasons, related to the availability of substitute sources of education,\nvariations in the physical characteristics of the housing stock making it\nmore or less suitable for accommodating children or the degree of\nuncertainty attached to current measures of school quality\u2019 (pp. 400-1).\nFurthermore, Cheshire and Sheppard (2004) concur with Timothy J\nBartik (1988) who argues that it is the elasticity of supply of the local\namenity, in this paper good schooling, that will influence the extent of\ncapitalisation. On this basis we might expect a reduction in the premium\npaid for good school performance, as the average level of school\nperformance increases.\nSome of the literature in this area focuses upon the inter-temporal nature\nof the capitalisation of improved local amenity. Bartik (1988) identifies a\nthree stage process. In the first instance there is an improvement in local\namenity. This is followed by a second stage whereby the improvement in\nlocal amenity is recognised by those agents who are active in the local\nproperty market. The third stage involves these agents reflecting\nimprovements in local amenity in their willingness to pay a premium for\nproperties that embody the improved local amenity. This process is\nimportant in the context of this study. Schools are incentivised to improve\nthe academic performance of their students in public examinations; this\nimproved performance is then reported in official statistics released by the\nDCSF and, finally, house buyers can be expected to react to the improved\nschool performance in their willingness to pay for properties which are\nproximate to the high performing schools.\nFinally, there is a rich literature dealing with the capitalisation of\nsecondary school performance on residential property prices based on the\nso-called hedonic approach to measurement in which the sale price of a\nproperty is a function of the physical characteristics of the house as well\nas its environmental amenities and location. Lori L Taylor (2005) and Ian\n7Davidoff and Andrew Leigh (2007) provide reviews of this literature,\nciting studies by Cheshire and Shepherd (2002, 2004); Gibbons and\nMachin (2003, 2006); Leslie Rosenthal (2003); Patrick J Bayer, Robert\nMcMillan and Fernando V Ferreira (2003); Sandra E Black (1999);\nDownes and Zabel (2002); Thomas J Kane, Douglas O Staiger and,\nStephanie K Riegg (2005); Randall Reback (2005); David L Weimer and\nMichael J Wolkoff (2001); Kathy J Hayes and Lori L Taylor (1996);\nBrian A Cromwell and William T Bogart (1997); Haurin and Brasington\n(1996) and Dennis Leech and Erick Campos (2003).\nA fundamental challenge facing the hedonic approach in this context is to\nensure that neighbourhood quality is correctly modelled. Failure to do so\nwould result in biased estimates of the impact of local school quality\n(performance) on local house prices. Specifically, as Black (1999)\nindicates, the standard hedonic approach will produce upwardly bias\nestimates of the impact of school performance on house prices if there are\nunobserved neighbourhood characteristics that are correlated with school\nquality and likely to influence house prices. Residential property prices\nreflect not only the characteristics of the properties themselves but also\nthose of the surrounding neighbourhood \u2013 and it is reasonable to assume\nthat higher status neighbourhoods tend to have better schools due to the\npupils\u2019 family backgrounds, the general quality of teachers, resources\npaid for by parents etc. Theodore M Crone (1998) argues that empirical\nevidence is available to show that academic achievement can be improved\nby the peer group effect. The existence of this \u2018endogeneity problem\u2019 can\nbe addressed in a number of ways.\nDavidoff and Leigh (2007) indicate there are four broad approaches to\ntackling the \u2018endogeneity problem\u2019. One approach is to control for\nvariation in neighbourhood effects by using data relating to properties\nadjacent to but on opposite sides of school catchment boundaries - see\nBlack (1999) and Gibbons and Machin (2003, 2006). In doing so, this\napproach implicitly controls for differences in neighbourhood quality by\nassuming that such properties will have identical neighbourhood\ncharacteristics. This approach, however, does not take into account\ndistance between properties on either side of the school catchment\nboundaries and the fact that properties at opposite ends of a particular\nschool catchment boundary may exhibit very different and perhaps\nunobservable neighbourhood characteristics.\n8A second approach is to investigate whether the data allow for any\n\u2018natural experiments\u2019 such as changes in school quality over a number of\nyears, schools which may have been closed, opened or other changes in\ntheir characteristics and to investigate whether property prices follow\nsuch changes. This approach is adopted by Kane, Staiger and Riegg\n(2005) and Reback (2005). The weakness of this approach is that it\nassumes that the mix of neighbourhood characteristics does not change\nover time.\nA third approach is do adopt an instrumental variables methodology\nwhich predicts residential property values independent of school\nperformance and then rigorously tests for school quality effects. An\nexample of this approach can be found in Rosenthal (2003) who uses\ngovernment inspections as an instrument for school quality. As Gibbons\nand Machin (2008) suggest the challenge for such an approach is to find\nappropriate instruments which are causally related to variations in school\nperformance while \u2018otherwise unrelated to housing prices\u2019.\nThe fourth approach, and the one adopted in this study, is to explicitly\ninclude variables which measure the \u2018quality\u2019 of the residential\nneighbourhood which may change over time alongside information\nconcerning the physical characteristics of houses and the performance of\nthe closest school. Examples of this approach include Weimar and\nWolkoff (2001) and Downes and Zabel (2002). As noted above it is vital\nthat the effect of neighbourhood characteristics is correctly modelled.\nThe study reported in this paper seeks to make a contribution to this\nexpanding area of research. This contribution can be gauged in a number\nof ways: we employ (a) a data set which has exceptional breadth and\ndepth; (b) we explicitly incorporate neighbourhood characteristics effects,\nthereby addressing the endogeneity issue common to studies of this kind;4\n(c) our ability to disaggregate the data set across different metropolitan\nareas allows for housing market segmentation and (d) the inter-temporal\nnature of our data set allows us to model the impact of changes in average\n4 We acknowledge the comments made by a referee concerning the importance of\naddressing the problem of endogeneity in studies of this kind. The depth and quality of\nthe data set employed here has allowed us to control for the physical house and\nneighbourhood environmental characteristics in a way that ensures that parameter\nestimates on our focus variable (school performance) are not upwardly biased (see\nSection 5 below for additional discussion of the empirical results).\n9school performance and changes in neighbourhood composition over\ntime.\n3. Description of the Dataset\nThe results reported in this paper are based on an exceptionally large\ndataset developed by HBoS (the largest residential mortgage lender in the\nUK). The dataset covers all the house purchase transactions on which the\nHBoS plc group has provided mortgage loans although for the purpose of\nthis paper, we have only selected data for the years 2001 to 2007. This\nperiod is chosen as a result of a desire to present estimations of\ncapitalisation which are contemporary rather than historical and,\nfollowing Bartik (1988), a desire to allow for a period of time to elapse\nwhereby house purchasers were fully aware of differing school\nperformances and could reflect this in their willingness to pay for\nproperties.\nData on School Quality\nIn the analysis below the data on \u2018school quality\u2019 measure the\nperformance of individual schools in terms of the percentage of students\nattaining five passes at GCSE grades A* to C. This percentage score was\nentered as a continuous variable in our preferred hedonic house price\nregression model. The data on school performance was obtained from the\nDCSF website for the years 2000-2006. The website also provided us\nwith the required locational data in terms of the postcode of each school.\nIn order to allow for the capitalisation of school performance into\nproperty prices we have lagged the school performance data one time\nperiod. Thus, we have regressed 2002 property prices on 2001 school\nperformance results. The rationale for this approach is that it is historical\nschool performance data that will impact current offer prices for\nresidential properties. In addition, we are suggesting that it is the most\nrecent historical school performance data that will have the most\nimmediate impact on the price offered by house purchasers. We\nexperimented with three-year moving averages of school performance but\nfound that school performance in the previous year performed more\neffectively as an explanatory variable.\n10\nData on Physical House Characteristics\nThe data on physical house characteristics is provided from the HBoS\nmortgage data set. The richness of the dataset allows us to analyse the\nimpact of school performance on residential property values to an extent\nwhich we feel has not been possible for researchers previously in the UK.\nThe database includes a detailed breakdown of the information on the\nfollowing house characteristics:\n\uf0b7 purchase price of the property recorded at the mortgage approval\nstage\n\uf0b7 property type, ie. whether the house is detached, semi-detached,\nterraced, bungalow, flat or maisonette;\n\uf0b7 number of habitable rooms;\n\uf0b7 floor space area;\n\uf0b7 number of bathrooms;\n\uf0b7 number of toilets;\n\uf0b7 availability of central heating;\n\uf0b7 number of garages and garage spaces;\n\uf0b7 garden;\n\uf0b7 age of property.\nData on Neighbourhood Characteristics\nOver and above these physical house characteristics, the database also\nincludes information on the location of each property in terms of\npostcodes. In order to locate each property and each school in our\ndataset, we employed Royal Mail Post Office postcodes. We then utilised\nthe Royal Mail's POSTZON software to provide us with an Ordnance\nSurvey (OS) grid map reference. This grid reference effectively places\neach property on the bottom left-hand corner of a 100 metre by 100 metre\ngrid. To each of the Eastings and Northings of the OS grid reference a\nfive was added, which effectively located each of our properties at the\ncentre of the 100 metre by 100 metre grid; i.e., at the expected location of\nany property within a 100 metre grid. We then developed a simple\ncomputer macro which applied Pythagoras's theorem and calculated the\nstraight line distance between each property in the dataset and the nearest\nschool.\nRosenthal (2003) reports that POSTZON locates each school and house\nwithin a maximum of 70 metres of its true location and concludes that for\nthe purpose of locating the nearest school to a given residential property,\n11\nthe use of the POSTZON database is unlikely to result in a serious\nmisallocation of houses to the nearest school. Gibbons and Machin (2008)\nsuggest that a lack of clearly defined catchment areas for state schools\nintroduces an amount of ambiguity in the link between residential\nproperty locations and accessibility to school. However, of primary\ninterest to this study is the motivation for parents to purchase a property\nclose to their school of choice. Parents will do this when they believe that\na school is oversubscribed and that the criteria which may be applied to\ntheir child\u2019s application for entry, in extremis, is straight line distance\nfrom the family home to the school of choice. Interestingly, the incentive\nto purchase a house close to a \u2018high performing\u2019 school may be greater in\nhouseholds where the oldest child is about to enter secondary education\nand there are younger brothers and sisters. In this case the \u2018straight line\ndistance\u2019 criteria may be applied to the eldest child but subsequent\nchildren would be \u2018guaranteed\u2019 a place on the basis that an elder brother\nor sister attended the school. We have not been able to control for this\neffect in this study.\nThe dataset also includes a special locational classification regime used in\nthe UK, known as ACORN, A Classification of Residential\nNeighbourhoods \u2013 for the full details of the ACORN classification\nsystem, based on postcodes, see CACI (2006). This regime allocates\nratings according to geo-demographic information, allowing for the\ncategorisation of the location of each property at two levels: at the micro\nlevel (immediate residential neighbourhood) and at the macro level (wider\nsurrounding area). In our study the inclusion of ACORN codes, in so far\nas they allow for the influence of the socioeconomic characteristics of a\nneighbourhood population, should pick up some of the so-called peer\ngroup affects; ie, our study allows for the socio-economic impacts on\nschool performance noted by Crone (1998).\nBased on postcode information, the location of each property is classified\ninto one of eight main ACORN groups as shown in Table 1 below.\n12\nTable 1: Description of Main ACORN Groups\nACORN\nGroup\nMain Characteristics of Group\nA Areas where residents are wealthy investors\nB Prospering families\nC Areas of traditional money\nD Young urbanites\nE F G Areas of middle-aged families (comfortable), contented\npensioners and families and individuals looking to settle\ndown (Middle Aged Comfort (E), Contented Pensioners\n(F) and Settling down (G))\nH Moderate living\nI K Meagre means and impoverished pensioners\nJ Inner city existence (low income singles and couples,\nmulti ethnic young singles renting flats, high rise\npoverty \u2013 dependent on welfare-poor young \u2013\nfinancially inactive)\nFinally, it should be noted that prior to estimation the dataset has been\n\u2018cleansed\u2019 to exclude properties which are atypical or can be described as\noutliers as well as to take account of coding errors in the data entry\nprocesses. In addition, houses are excluded if the nearest school is further\nthan 10 kilometres away in order to provide an outer boundary to the\nurban conurbations that we have studied.\n4. Modelling Framework\nIn this study we employ the hedonic approach to pricing to determine a\nmonetary valuation which parents place on the performance of schools.\nThe hedonic method makes use of information on property prices (Pit)\nand property characteristics to determine the value of individual\nattributes. These attributes include physical attributes of a particular\nhouse (denoted by Xht ) as described earlier, as well as neighbourhood\nvariables (Xnt ), and environmental variables (Xet ) which in this study\ninclude the \u2018quality\u2019 of the most proximate state school.\n13\nThus the general hedonic price model to be estimated is as follows:\nPit = f (Xht, Xnt, Xet, eit) (1)\nwhere:\nPit = house price i in time period t\nXht = physical housing characteristics\nXnt = neighbourhood (location) characteristics\nXet = environmental characteristics\neit = unmeasured factors\nBy regressing the physical, neighbourhood and environmental\ncharacteristics of a set of properties against the purchase price as the\ndependent variable, it is possible to calculate implicit prices for each of\nthe characteristics.5\nIt should be noted that in hedonic estimation attention must be given to\nthe choice of an appropriate functional form, the optimal combination of\nexplanatory variables and the potential problem of multicollinearity. Tests\ndeveloped by George E P Box and D R Cox (1964) are employed in this\nstudy and resulted in a semi-log specification as the most appropriate\nfunctional form. This particular functional form has the advantage of ease\nof interpretation of parameter estimates. Analyses were also carried out to\ndetermine the optimal combinations and appropriate transformations of\nthe explanatory variables in the regression model. In particular, the results\nshowed that floor area consistently outperforms the number of habitable\nrooms in explaining house prices.\nWith such a rich data set it is desirable to use as many variables as\npossible to define our house price equation; however, in practice, some\nexplanatory variables may be correlated with each other \u2013 in other words,\nthe problem of multicollinearity may exist. Garrod and Willis (1992)\n5 Hedonic pricing methods have also been employed to calculate the value of a wide\nrange of both \u201cwelcome\u201d and \u201cunwelcome\u201d local amenities. These include aircraft noise\n(Terrence J Levesque, 1994), air quality (Kenneth Y Chay and Michael Greenstone,\n2004), hazardous waste sites (Jill J McCluskey and Gordon C Rausser, 2000), woodland\n(Guy Garrod and Ken Willis, 1992) and the proximity of churches (A Quang Do, Robert\nW Wilbur, James L Short, 1994; Thomas M Carroll, Terrance MClauretie, Jeff Jensen,\n1996).\n14\nindicate that multicollinearity is a common problem in hedonic price\nfunctions and one which is often conveniently ignored. Tests for\nmulticollinearity were conducted based on the methodology outlined in\nDavid A Belsey, Edwin Kuh and Roy E Welsch. (1980).\nThe performance of what Philip Graves et al (1988) term \u2018focus\u2019\nvariables \u2013 in this paper, the school performance variable - is of primary\nimportance. We experimented with dummy variables including those\nwhich separated the dataset into discrete deciles and excluded the deciles\nwhich included the national average and local average school\nperformances; we also experimented with excluding lower deciles and\nhigher deciles. Dummy variables were included to pick up the effect of\nbetter than and worse than performances with respect to national and local\naverages. In all of these cases the dummy variables failed to work as\neffectively as the continuous specification of the school performance\nvariable that we ultimately included in our preferred equation.\nFinally, as the preferred regression equation covered more than one time\nperiod we have indexed the equation using the \u2018time dummy\u2019 method\n(Michael C Fleming and Joseph G Nellis, 1985). Therefore, with time\nincorporated as a dummy variable, percentage changes in price can be\nobserved directly as the coefficient on the time variable, our base year in\nall cases being 2001.\n5. Empirical Results\nThe final regression model uses the natural log of house price as the\ndependent variable (ln P). Combinations of the following independent\nvariables were used: dummy variables to capture the impact of house type\n(detached, semi-detached, terraced, flat and bungalow); the existence of a\ngarden; none or partial central heating; the age of the property (split into\nfive distinct classifications \u2013 properties built prior to 1919, properties\nbuilt between 1919-45, 1945-60, post-1960 and new build). A set of\nACORN ratings dummy variables was included to allow for variability in\nneighbourhood characteristics while annual time dummy variables were\nincluded to allow for the influence of inflationary effects over the period\n2001-2007 not associated with the physical, neighbourhood or\nenvironmental characteristics of the properties in our dataset. A dummy\nvariable was incorporated to link each property in our dataset with the\nnearest secondary school. Continuous measures of numbers of\n15\nbathrooms, toilets, garages and garage spaces and the size of a property,\nwhich measures the internal floor space (measured in square metres) were\nalso included in the final equation. Our data set allowed us to experiment\nwith specifications which included the number of habitable rooms but this\nspecification was rejected in favour of a continuous floor space variable\non the basis of goodness-of-fit and the overall performance of other\nvariables in our preferred equation.\nTherefore, the model provides an estimate of the influence of property\ncharacteristics with reference to a \u2018standard\u2019 house (David Forrest et al\n1996). In this study our standard property in each city was determined on\nthe basis of identifying the modal characteristics. Thus in all cities the\nstandard house had full central heating and no garden while the excluded\nhouse types, house ages and ACORN types are reported in Table 2 below.\nThe modal characteristics are excluded from our equation and the\ncoefficients on the included dummy variables can be interpreted as a\npercentage premium or discount relative to the excluded modal\ncharacteristic.\nTable 2: Excluded house type, house age and ACORN code by city\nCity House type House Age* ACORN\nBirmingham Semi-detached 1960+ IK\nBristol Terraced Pre 1919 EFG\nLeeds Terraced 1960+ IK\nLiverpool Semi-detached 1960+ IK\nLondon Flat Pre 1919 D\nManchester Terraced 1960+ IK\nNewcastle Semi-detached 1960+ IK\n*1960+ denotes properties built after 1960, but not new build.\nThe regression results are presented in the Appendix, Tables A \u2013 G for\neach of the seven cities in turn.\nTable 3 below reports the estimated regression coefficient on the school\nperformance variable in each of the seven cities along with the\ncorresponding average standard deviation. This allows us to report a\npercentage house price premium for an additional one standard deviation\nof school performance above the average in each city. The inclusion of\nthe average house price in each city in 2007 allows us to monetise the\npremium for an additional one standard deviation of school performance\nabove the mean.\n16\nTable 3: Coefficient on school performance variable and the\nresidential house price premium for a local school with GCSE\nperformance one standard deviation above the local average.\nCity Coefficient Average\nstandard\ndeviation\nof GCSE\nresults\nPercentage\nhouse price\npremium for\none\nadditional\nstandard\ndeviation in\nschool\nperformance\nAverage\nhouse\nprice\n(\u00a3, 2007)\nHouse price\npremium for\none\nadditional\nstandard\ndeviation\n(\u00a3, 2007)\nBirmingham 0.001 17.31 +1.7% 197,086 3,350\nBristol 0.003 18.07 +5.4% 250,210 13,511\nLeeds 0.002 18.33 +3.6% 178,284 6,418\nLiverpool 0.001 21.08 +2.1% 188,378 3,956\nLondon 0.001 18.64 +1.9% 367,029 6,973\nGreater\nManchester\n0.002 15.96 +3.2% 188,372 6,028\nNewcastle 0.001 16.06 +1.6% 169,858 2,718\nSource: average standard deviation based on authors\u2019 calculations\nemploying DCSF data.\nThe above results suggest that in Birmingham, Liverpool, London and\nNewcastle, for every 10% point improvement in the average GCSE pass\nrate (% or more GCSEs at grades A*-C), property prices increase by 1%.\nThis would imply that, ceteris paribus, a school which had a pass rate of\n80% would give rise to a local property price premium of 4% compared\nto properties where the local state-funded secondary school had a pass\nrate of 40%.\nIn order to facilitate comparison across a number of studies, Gibbons and\nMachin (2008) and Davidoff and Leigh (2007) summarise the results of\nvarious studies by reporting the percentage increase in house prices\nstemming from an increase in school performance equivalent to one\nstandard deviation above the city mean. Table 3 shows the average\nstandard deviation of results, in each city, over the period of this study\nand the resulting house price premia (in percentage terms) based on the\n17\nschool performance coefficients. For example, in Birmingham an\nadditional one standard deviation of school performance increases\nresidential property prices by 1.7% whereas in Bristol an additional\nstandard deviation of school performance increases property prices by\n5.4%. In addition, Table 3 also shows the value of these house price\npremia in absolute terms (\u00a3). Note that these premia are computed on the\nbasis of average house prices in each city in 2007 multiplied by the\ncorresponding percentage house price premium averaged over the seven\nyears of this study. It is clear from these results that the cost of \u2018good\u2019\neducation varies across the cities studied ranging from \u00a32.7k in Newcastle\nto \u00a313.5k in Bristol. This would appear to justify our geographical\nsegmentation approach to modelling the relationship between school\nperformance and house prices. The monetary values attached to a one\nstandard deviation improvement would not appear to be out of line with\nthose reported by Black (1999) and Gibbons and Machin (2006).\nFurthermore, in Greater London in 2006, DCSF statistics indicate that the\nrange of school performance varied from a pass rate of 21% for the lowest\nperforming school to 98% for the highest performing school. The house\nprice premia that the highest performing school generated in 2007\ncompared to the lowest performing school is approximately \u00a333,400. This\nis less than the comparable 2004 figure for Greater London of \u00a361,000\nreported by Gibbons and Machin (2008). This may be partially explained\nby a greater range of school performance in 2004 (12%-99%) compared\nto 2006 (22%-98%). It would also appear to be the case that our preferred\nstrategy for modelling neighbourhood characteristics has resulted in\ncoefficient estimates on the school performance variable which are not\nupwardly biased.\nFurthermore, the results provide some support for the assertion in the\nhedonic literature that where the elasticity of supply of good schooling is\nunresponsive then price premia will be greater. To illustrate this point,\nTable 4 below reports the percentage of students obtaining 5 or more\nGCSE\u2019s at grades A* - C in the seven cities over the period 2000 to 2006.\nStudents\u2019 performance in 2007 is not reported in this table as our model\nsuggests that house prices in any one year will be contingent upon the\nprevious year\u2019s GCSE performance of the nearest state school. Table 4\nshows that Bristol started and ended the period with the lowest average\nschool performance of the seven cities. This contrasts with Newcastle\nwhich started the period with an unspectacular average performance but\n18\nexhibited a much greater elasticity of supply of \u2018good schools\u2019 on the\nbasis of average school performance over the period.\nTable 4: Percentage of students gaining five or more GCSE passes at\ngrades A* - C (2001-2006)\nCity 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nBirmingham\nMean 35 36.9 41.3 46.1 48.1 53.9 56.7\nBristol\nMean 32 32.9 32.2 38 36.9 37.5 46.4\nLeeds\nMean 37.7 38 39.6 43.2 45.2 50.3 52.3\nLiverpool\nMean 34.9 36.7 39.5 41.7 45.3 51.6 57.2\nLondon\nMean 43.2 44.6 47.3 50.2 53 54.9 58.1\nManchester\nMean 40.9 41.9 43.7 46 46.4 50.4 53.7\nNewcastle\nMean 32.1 39.8 41.9 41 45.2 59.6 56.1\nSource: Department for Children, Schools and Families (see\nwww.education.gov.uk\/researchandstatistics\/attainmenttables).\nFinally, in order to examine the impact that including ACORN values had\non the school quality variable we estimated our hedonic equation with\nhousing characteristic variables only and then with housing characteristic\nand ACORN values included. As Table 5 below indicates, in the cases of\nBirmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Greater London, Manchester and Newcastle\nthe impact of adding ACORN codes was to reduce the coefficient on the\nschool performance variable, suggesting that any endogeneity issues that\n19\nexisted with respect to \u2018neighbourhood quality\u2019 in these local housing\nmarkets have been (at worst, partially) accounted for.\nTable 5: Comparison of School Quality coefficient when regression\nmodel includes only housing characteristics variables with a\nregression model including housing characteristic variables and\nACORN values.

Summary and Conclusions\nThe results in this study provide robust evidence that the differences in\nstate-funded secondary school performance in GCSE examinations is\nconsistently capitalised into residential property prices; ie., residential\nproperties which are located proximate to high performing state-funded\nsecondary schools attract a price premium. The extent of the price\npremium varies between different cities. In Greater London, Liverpool,\nBirmingham and Newcastle a 10% point differential in GCSE\n20\nperformance produces a 1% point differential in residential properties\nlocated close to the high performing school. In Greater Manchester and\nLeeds the same differential in school performance produces a 2% point\nincrease in residential properties located close to the high performing\nschool, while in Bristol a 10% point differential in GCSE performance\nproduces a 3% point increase in residential properties located close to the\nhigh performing school. Note that this implies that in Bristol a property\nwhere the closest school had a pass rate of 80% compared to a property\nwhere the closest school had a pass rate of 40% would attract a price\npremium of 12% points, ceteris paribus. Using average prices in 2007\nand the average percentage premia for an improvement in school\nperformance since 2001, we find that the value placed on \u2018good\neducation\u2019 in terms of a premium on house prices ranges from \u00a313.5k in\nBristol to \u00a32.7k in Newcastle.\nWe experimented with different representations of school performance.\nSpecifically, we examined if there were threshold values of GCSE pass\nrates which defined a \u2018good\u2019 school. We also examined the relative\nperformance of schools to ascertain if a house price premium was paid for\nan above local average or above national average performance. In all\ncases none of the alternative specifications of school performance\nproduced superior results to our preferred specification. This reinforces\nthe suggestion that it is the absolute performance of the nearest state\nfunded secondary schools that parents focus upon when making house\npurchasing decisions.\nThe cities which attracted the highest price premia for \u2018good\u2019 school\nperformance were those where the average pass rate in GCSE\nexaminations was the lowest. In other words, in those cities where the\nsupply of good schools was lower, the price premium for a \u2018good\u2019 school,\nin terms of the rate at which school performance was capitalised into local\nproperty prices, was higher. This finding has implications for students\u2019\nability to access high performing schools, in so far as their parents have\nan inability to pay the price premium required to purchase a house which\nwould guarantee access. The response of the current UK government to\nthe paradox of pupils being denied access to state-funded education due to\ntheir parents \u2018inability\u2019 to pay a shadow price that exists in the local\nresidential property market is to introduce a lottery into the allocation of\nplaces at \u2018oversubscribed\u2019 schools. We would suggest that this is\ninappropriate in that it deals with the symptoms of the problem rather\n21\nthan the causes. We would argue that the government should focus on\nimproving school quality as doing so would remove the extent of the\nprice premium that \u2018high performing\u2019 schools attract, thereby reducing\nthe extent to which students would be excluded from state-funded\nsecondary education because of their parents inability to \u2018pay the price\u2019 in\nlocal residential property markets.\nFinally, it may be the case that the private sector may be willing to fund\nimprovements in state-funded secondary schooling, as low performing\nschools will mean that they may find it difficult to attract workers with\nchildren of secondary school age to areas where secondary school\nperformance is poor. In such circumstances workers may require wages\nwhich allow them to educate their children at private schools or in\nextremis they may not move to a particular city. In addition, appropriate\npublic transport policy may enable students to access good performing\nschools from a greater geographical distance and perhaps alleviate any\nupward pressures on local house prices. These points are worthy of\nfurther investigation.\n22\nReferences:\nBartik, Timothy J. 1988. \u201cMeasuring the benefits of amenity\nimprovements in hedonic price models\u201d Land Economics, 64(2): 172-183.\nBayer, Patrick J, Robert McMillan, and, Fernando V Ferreira. 2003.\n\u201cA unified framework for measuring preferences for schools and\nneighbourhoods\u201d Yale University Economic Growth Center, Discussion\nPaper 872..\nBelsey, David A, Edwin Kuh, and Roy E Welsch. 1980.
