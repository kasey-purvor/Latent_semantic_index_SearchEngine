While customers as economic actors have often\nbeen overlooked in studies of computer supported work they\nare generally and necessarily the focus of commercial\norganisational life. The paper explicates the developing\nrelationship between technology use and these\norganisational concerns through the notion of \u2018the customer\nin the machine.\u2019 Features of the contingent and skilful\nnature of everyday work are documented and used to\ncomment on aspects of working with the \u2018customer in the\nmachine\u2019 or \u2018virtual customers\u2019 within a rapidly changing\ncommercial organisation.<\/dc:description><dc:description>This paper was originally presented at the International Conference on Supporting Group Work \nNovember 14-17, 1999 \nPhoenix, Arizona, USA.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>ACM Press<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-14T16:04:31Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Meetings & Proceedings<\/dc:type><dc:format>YES<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>Proceedings of the international ACM SIGGROUP conference on Supporting group work, pp. 30-39<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1-58113-065-1<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1145\/320297.320301<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/8410<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/delivery.acm.org\/10.1145\/330000\/320301\/p30-hughes.pdf?key1=320301&key2=6628641711&coll=portal&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/delivery.acm.org\/10.1145\/330000\/320301\/p30-hughes.pdf?key1=320301&key2=6628641711&coll=portal&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618"],"year":2007,"topics":["Customers","Ethnography","Computer supported cooperative work","Retail financial services"],"subject":["Meetings & Proceedings"],"fullText":null}
