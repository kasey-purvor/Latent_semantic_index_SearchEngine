To elucidate general patterns in the relationship between 19 \ninvertebrate herbivory, plant diversity, and productivity we carried out a long-term herbivore 20 \nexclusion experiment at multiple grassland sites in a mountainous landscape of central Germany. 21 \nOver a period of five years, we used above-and belowground insecticides as well as a 22 \nmolluscicide to manipulate invertebrate herbivory at 14 grassland sites, covering a wide range of 23 \nplant species diversity (13 \u2013 38 species m-2) and aboveground plant productivity (272 - 1125 g m-24 \n2 year-1), where plant species richness and productivity of the sites were not significantly 25 \ncorrelated. 26 \nHerbivore exclusion had significant effects on the plant communities: it decreased plant 27 \nspecies richness and evenness, and it altered plant community composition. In particular, 28 \nexclusion of belowground herbivores promoted grasses at the expense of herbs. In contrast to our 29 \nexpectation, herbivore effects on plant community biomass were not influenced by productivity. 30 \nHowever, effect size of invertebrate herbivores was negatively correlated with plant diversity of 31 \nthe grasslands: the effect of herbivory on biomass tended to be negative at sites of high diversity 32 \nand positive at sites of low diversity. In general, the effects of aboveground herbivores were 33 \nrelatively small as compared to belowground herbivores which were important drivers of plant 34 \ncommunity composition. Our study is the first to show that variation in the effects of invertebrate 35 \nherbivory on plant communities across a landscape is significantly influenced by plant species 36 \nrichness.  37 \n3 \n 38 \nKeywords: biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, plant functional groups, long term insect 39 \nexclusion, invertebrate herbivores, semi-natural grasslands, primary productivity 40 \n4 \nINTRODUCTION 41 \nHerbivorous invertebrates outweigh vertebrates as much as 10-fold in temperate terrestrial 42 \necosystems (Pimentel and Andow 1984). Nevertheless, their role in determining plant 43 \ncommunity dynamics is generally considered to be less important when compared to vertebrates 44 \n(Crawley 1989). The most immediate effect of invertebrate herbivores is the consumption of 45 \nplant tissue (Crawley 1983, Karban and Baldwin 1997, Crawley 1997). Additionally, 46 \ninvertebrate herbivores may influence plant species composition and diversity by selective 47 \nfeeding on dominant species and thereby, releasing subordinate species from competition 48 \n(Crawley 1989, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Carson and Root 1999, Long et al. 2003). These 49 \neffects, however, are not consistent across different ecosystems (Hillebrand et al. 2007), or 50 \nacross different herbivore guilds. For example, plant diversity in early successional plant 51 \ncommunities was found to be enhanced by aboveground (Brown and Gange 1992, Carson and 52 \nRoot 2000), and reduced by belowground herbivores (Brown and Gange 1989a, Brown and 53 \nGange 1992). Environmental factors and plant community characteristics are considered to be 54 \nfurther sources of variation in the effects of herbivores on plant diversity (Olff and Ritchie 1998).  55 \nEcosystem level effects of herbivores, e.g. on plant community biomass, are suggested to 56 \ndecrease with increasing plant diversity via either a reduced abundance of specialist herbivores 57 \nor an increased abundance of natural enemies (Pimentel 1961, Root 1973). However, results 58 \nfrom previous studies have been ambiguous (Andow 1991, Jactel et al. 2005, Jactel and 59 \nBrockerhoff 2007). A few studies have confirmed the predicted decrease in herbivore abundance 60 \nor damage in more diverse plant communities (Mulder et al. 1999, Unsicker et al. 2006, Jactel 61 \nand Brockerhoff 2007), but others have found a positive or negative relationship depending on 62 \nthe type of herbivore studied (Koricheva et al. 2000, Otway et al. 2005). Yet others have found 63 \n5 \nno such relationship suggesting that particular plant functional groups may be more important 64 \nthan species richness per se (Scherber et al. 2006). Furthermore, ecosystem level effects of 65 \nherbivores are suggested to be affected by primary productivity (Fretwell 1977, Oksanen et al. 66 \n1981, Fretwell 1987, Oksanen 1990) with the strongest herbivore impact expected at 67 \nintermediate levels of productivity (\u201chypothesis of exploitation ecosystems\u201d, also known as the 68 \nFretwell-Oksanen model). At low primary productivity, plant biomass may not suffice to sustain 69 \nappreciable populations of herbivores (bottom-up control of herbivores), whereas at high levels 70 \nof productivity top-down control of herbivores by predators is expected. Even though this model 71 \nwas originally devised for vertebrate herbivores (Oksanen et al. 1981, Oksanen 1990), it has 72 \nbeen suggested to also apply to invertebrates (Oksanen and Oksanen 2000, Sch\u00e4dler et al. 2003). 73 \nAlthough a number of invertebrate exclusion experiments have been conducted to date, it 74 \nis still difficult to draw general conclusions about how productivity and plant diversity of 75 \nterrestrial ecosystems influence herbivory. There are several reasons for this. First, most studies 76 \nhave investigated the effects of plant diversity and productivity on herbivory separately, and 77 \nthose that have considered both factors simultaneously (e.g., Siemann 1998) did not focus on 78 \nherbivore effects on the plant community. Second, many studies have been carried out in 79 \nagricultural or forest systems where the diversity gradient was low, often ranging from just one 80 \nspecies (monoculture) to two (intercropping), raising the question of the generality of the results 81 \n(Andow 1991). Third, the effects of invertebrates on plant communities can often only be 82 \ndetected after years (e.g., Cain et al. 1991, Long et al. 2003). What is needed therefore are long-83 \nterm studies in natural ecosystems that simultaneously investigate productivity and plant 84 \ndiversity effects on the influence that invertebrate herbivores exert on a plant community.  85 \n6 \nIn our study, we investigated the effects of above- and belowground invertebrate 86 \nherbivory on plant species diversity and aboveground plant community biomass along natural 87 \ngradients of plant species richness and productivity. This enabled us to explore whether variation 88 \nin herbivory among sites can be explained by these two community characteristics. Using 14 89 \nextensively managed hay meadows in one region of central Germany, we were able to minimize 90 \nthe impact of confounding factors such as site management. Over a period of five years, using a 91 \nfactorial design, we applied pesticides to exclude mollusks and insects from experimental plots 92 \nboth above- and belowground, to test the following hypotheses:  93 \n(1) Invertebrate herbivores generally decrease aboveground biomass.  94 \n(2) Invertebrate herbivores increase species diversity of plant communities.  95 \n(3) The effect of herbivory on aboveground biomass decreases with increasing plant diversity 96 \nand is strongest at intermediate levels of primary productivity.  97 \n98 \n7 \nMETHODS 99 \nStudy sites 100 \nThe study was conducted in the Frankenwald and Th\u00fcringer Schiefergebirge (11\u00b000\u2019-11\u00b037\u2019E 101 \nand 50\u00b021\u2019-50\u00b034\u2019N), a plateau-like mountain range at the border between Bavaria and 102 \nThuringia in central Germany with a elevation ranging from 500 to 870 m a.s.l. The bedrock 103 \nmaterial in the area consists mainly of schist and greywacke and produces a carbonate-free, 104 \nnutrient-poor soil. Mean annual air temperature is 5\u00b0C to 7\u00b0C, and mean annual precipitation 105 \nranges from 840 to 1200 mm with a slight summer maximum (Hiekel et al. 2004). Before human 106 \nsettlement, montane spruce-fir-beech forests formed the natural vegetation. Since human 107 \nsettlement in medieval times much of the forest has been converted into an agricultural landscape 108 \nwith a large proportion of montane hay meadows (Hundt 1964).  109 \nBased on a survey of more than 70 grassland sites in 2001 (Kahmen et al. 2005, Perner et 110 \nal. 2005), we selected a subset of 14 montane hay meadows (phytosociologically classified as 111 \nGeranio-Trisetetum, Knapp ex Oberd. 1975) that vary in plant species diversity but are similar 112 \nwith respect to orographic conditions and management regime. The size of the total study area 113 \nwas 114 km\u00b2. The distance between two neighboring sites varied between 120 m and 6.5 km. 114 \nPlant species richness, as measured in June 2002, ranged from 13 to 38 vascular plants m-2 across 115 \nsites. Mean standing aboveground biomass, also measured in June 2002, ranged from 230 to 116 \n591 g m-2 (dry biomass). Prior to the onset of the study, all study sites had been managed 117 \nextensively for at least ten years by cutting for hay, with two cuts per year around the end of June 118 \nand at the beginning of September, and no grazing and no fertilizer application. During the 119 \ncourse of the study, this management regime was continued. 120 \n8 \n In 2004, a total of 21,624 insects were caught by sweep-netting in nine of the 14 study 121 \nsites (150 sweep net counts per site) on six dates throughout the growing season. The most 122 \nabundant herbivore taxa were Aphidina (16.1%), Coleoptera (10.2%), Auchenorrhyncha (8.4%), 123 \nOrthoptera (3.3%) and Lepidoptera (1.5%) (Unsicker et al. 2006). Mean damage levels measured 124 \nin the same year as percentage of leaf area loss were below 6% (Unsicker et al. 2006) which is in 125 \nline with other studies in grasslands (e.g., Scherber et al. 2006).  126 \n 127 \nManipulation of invertebrate herbivory 128 \nAt each of the 14 grassland sites, we established permanent plots separated by 1 m guard strips. 129 \nPesticides were applied to the plots to exclude aboveground herbivores (insects and mollusks, 130 \naboveground treatment, plot size: 5x5 m), belowground herbivores (insects only, belowground 131 \ntreatment, plot size: 2x2.5 m) or both above- and belowground herbivores (combined treatment, 132 \nplot size: 2x2.5 m). Treatments started in June 2002, after the first mowing of the grasslands in 133 \nthat year, and continued through to the end of 2007. To exclude aboveground herbivores we 134 \nsprayed Dimethoate (Perfekthion, BASF, Germany), a broad spectrum quasi-systemic foliar 135 \ninsecticide (Tomlin 2006). Diluted in water, it was applied in biweekly intervals at the 136 \nrecommended rate of 0.15 g of active ingredient m-2. The aboveground treatment also included 137 \nthe application of molluscicide pellets (metaldehyde, 0.6 g of active ingredient m-2) every two or 138 \nfour weeks. When rainfall intensity in the study area was low, monthly application of 139 \nmolluscicide was deemed sufficient. The belowground treatment consisted of the application of 140 \nChlorpyrifos, a contact soil pesticide without systemic effect (Tomlin 2006). It was applied 141 \nmonthly at a concentration of 0.9 g m-2 of the active compound. From June 2002 to October 142 \n2004, we applied a granular form of the belowground pesticide (Hortex, Scotts Celaflor, 143 \n9 \nGermany). After 2004, we could only purchase a form of Chlorpyrifos (Dow AgroSciences 144 \nGmbH, Germany) that had to be dissolved in water and sprayed onto the soil surface of the plots 145 \n(0.05 L m-2). The combined treatment consisted of an application of the molluscicide, the foliar 146 \nand the soil pesticide. Two control treatments were established: an untreated control (plot size: 147 \n5x5 m) and a water control (plot size: 2x2.5 m). The water control received the same amount of 148 \nwater as used for application of the foliar pesticide (0.04 L m-2). Due to logistic reasons and 149 \nshortage of space for the experimental plots in the respective grasslands, we were neither able to 150 \nset up 5x5 m plots for each of the treatments nor to set up replications within the study sites. 151 \nTreatments were always applied on the same day at all sites from May to October in each year, 152 \nresulting in a total number of 9 to 11 aboveground and 4 to 5 belowground pesticide applications 153 \nper year depending on the length of the growing season in each particular year. All pesticides 154 \nused in this study are commonly applied in agriculture and they have been successfully 155 \nemployed in other experimental grassland studies (Brown and Gange 1989b, Carson and Root 156 \n2000).  157 \n 158 \nMeasurement of plant diversity and productivity 159 \nIn June 2002, pre-treatment plant diversity and productivity were determined at each site. 160 \nMeasurement of treatment effects started one year after the first pesticide applications. In June 161 \n2003, four 1x1m subplots separated by 1 m were permanently marked in the center of plots of 162 \nthe aboveground treatment as well as the control, and due to the smaller size of the plots, only 163 \none 1x1 m subplot was marked in the center of the belowground treatment, the combined 164 \ntreatment and the water control within each grassland site. In late June of every year, from 2003 165 \nuntil 2006, at peak standing biomass and directly before the first mowing, all vascular plants in 166 \n10 \nthese eleven subplots per site were identified to species level. Percent cover m-2 of each species 167 \nwas visually estimated using a modified Londo scale (Londo 1976). For the aboveground 168 \ntreatment and the control, species richness as well as plant cover were determined for each 169 \nsubplot, and then averaged across subplots in the respective treatment plot. To ensure that these 170 \ncalculations did not affect our results we repeated the statistical analyses described below 171 \nincluding only one randomly choosen subplot for each of these treatments per study site. Since 172 \nthe results did not differ qualitatively, all analyses presented in this paper refer to the calculations 173 \ndescribed above. 174 \nWe used plant species cover to calculate evenness values for each treatment separately, 175 \nbased on the Shannon index: 176 \nS\npp\nEH ii\nln\n))(ln(\u2211\u2212\n=\u2032 ,  177 \nwhere pi is the proportion of total abundance of the ith species and S is the number of 178 \nspecies (Magurran 1988). Cover data were also collected for plant functional groups. Following 179 \nthe classification of herbs by Klotz et al. (2002), we classified all plants into one of five 180 \nfunctional groups: grasses, legumes, rosette forming herbs, hemirosette herbs and erosulate herbs 181 \n(Appendix 1).  182 \nAboveground plant community biomass was harvested twice a year (late June and 183 \nSeptember), according to the existing mowing regime of the grasslands, from 2002-2006. 184 \nImmediately before mowing of the entire sites, biomass in each plot was sampled in 20 x 50 cm 185 \nsquares (0.10 m\u00b2) for each plot by cutting the vegetation 2 cm above the ground. Four samples 186 \nwere taken from each plot in June 2002 (to measure pre-treatment productivity). From 2003 187 \n11 \nonwards, eight samples were taken in the aboveground treatment and the control and four in the 188 \nother plots. After drying the biomass samples at 60\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C for at least 48 h to achieve weight 189 \nconstancy, aboveground dry biomass was determined in g m-2. Aboveground plant community 190 \nbiomass was used (1) to quantify the effects of herbivores on the plant community from 2003 to 191 \n2006 (henceforth \u2018aboveground biomass\u2019) but also (2) as an estimate of site productivity before 192 \nthe start of the experiment in 2002 (henceforth \u2018productivity\u2019) which in turn might affect 193 \nherbivory.  194 \n 195 \nData analysis 196 \nThe water control treatment was not included in the analyses, as there were no significant 197 \ndifferences between this treatment and the untreated control treatment with respect to the number 198 \nof plant species (control: 19.97 \u00b1 0.20 species m-2, water control: 19.79 \u00b1 0.15 species m-2), 199 \nevenness (control: 0.71 \u00b1 0.01, water control: 0.70 \u00b1 0.01) and productivity (control: 445.93 \u00b1 200 \n21.70 g dry mass m-2, water control: 432.60 \u00b1 33.10 g dry mass m-2 ; means averaged over four 201 \nyears \u00b1 SE, P > 0.05 in each case). This suggests that the amount of water used for pesticide 202 \napplication (0.04 L m-2) was too small to have any effects in itself. 203 \nWe analyzed the effects of 5-years of invertebrate herbivory suppression on aboveground 204 \nbiomass, plant species richness, evenness and plant functional group cover using two-factorial 205 \nrepeated-measures ANOVAs, with aboveground treatment and belowground treatment as 206 \nfactors. Site was included in the model as blocking factor. The fact that we excluded the water 207 \ncontrol from the analyses and that we had no replicates within study sites resulted in a total 208 \nsample size of 56 (2x2x14) per year. To account for repeated measurements, we applied a 209 \n12 \nmultivariate approach using MANOVA as implemented in JMP (version 5.1.2, SAS Institute 210 \nInc., Cary, NC, USA, 1989-2005) and results are not dependent on the order in which the 211 \nindependent variables are listed. Degrees of freedom were adjusted with Greenhouse\u2013Geisser 212 \nEpsilon to accommodate for a potential lack of variance\u2013covariance matrix compound 213 \nsymmetry. Biomass data were log-transformed prior to analysis to achieve normality and 214 \nhomoscedasticity. To account for multiple comparisons within each hypothesis, we applied the 215 \nBenjamini-Hochberg method (Verhoeven et al. 2005) separately to the analyses of the diversity 216 \nmeasurements (plant species richness, evenness) and to these of the cover of plant functional 217 \ngroups.  218 \nTo analyze whether invertebrate herbivory was dependent on plant diversity and 219 \nproductivity of the study sites we calculated for each site a log response ratio of aboveground 220 \nbiomass: 221 \n 222 \n(1)   lnRRB = ln(Bcombined\/Bcontrol), 223 \n 224 \nwhere Bcombined and Bcontrol represent biomass of the plant community in the combined and 225 \nthe control treatment, respectively. Positive values of lnRRB indicate that pesticide application 226 \nincreased community biomass whereas negative values of lnRRB indicate a decrease in biomass 227 \ndue to pesticide applications. 228 \nThe lnRRB was calculated for each site and year, and regressed against pre-treatment 229 \nplant species richness and pre-treatment productivity using a similar repeated measures approach 230 \n13 \nas described above. We used the pre-treatment data as explanatory variables to avoid a spurious 231 \nregression resulting from the same productivity in the dependent and the independent variables 232 \n(for a detailed discussion see Jackson 1997, Coupe and Cahill 2003). To test for a unimodal 233 \nrelationship between herbivore impact and productivity as predicted by the exploitation 234 \necosystem hypothesis, we explicitly included a quadratic term. After analyzing their effects on 235 \nLnRRB separately, we simultaneously included plant diversity, productivity and its quadratic 236 \nterm in the model to explore whether each of them has still an effect after correcting for the other 237 \nvariable. 238 \nTo evaluate general treatment effects on individual plant species, we calculated the log 239 \nresponse ratio (Hedges et al. 1999) for each plant species i as  240 \n 241 \n(2)   lnRRC(i) = ln(Combined(i)\/Ccontrol(i)),  242 \n 243 \nwhere Ccombined(i) is the cover of plant species i in the combined treatment and Ccontrol(i) is 244 \nits cover in the control treatment, both averaged across all study sites and years. When a species 245 \nwas absent from a study site over all years, this was treated as a missing value. A positive lnRRC 246 \nindicates that the cover of a plant species did increase in response to pesticide application 247 \nwhereas a negative lnRRC indicates the opposite. Only plant species recorded in more than 20% 248 \nof the study sites (i.e. the 37 most frequent plant species) were included in this analysis.  249 \nTo analyze whether species\u2019 responses to pesticide application were related to their 250 \nabundances, we calculated an ANCOVA on lnRRC values using abundance data of individual 251 \n14 \nspecies as covariate and site as a factor, and including the site x abundance interaction to test for 252 \nhomogeneity of slopes. Abundance data per study site were averaged across all study years to 253 \navoid too many zero values for which lnRRC are not defined. Species abundances were taken 254 \nfrom the pre-treatment census in 2002 to avoid that the same abundance data were used to 255 \ncalculate the lnRRC values. Rare plant species, i.e. species with a mean cover of < 3% 256 \ndetermined during the pre-treatment census in 2002, were not included in this analysis. 257 \n258 \n15 \nRESULTS 259 \nThe response of aboveground biomass to the pesticide treatments was similar in both June and 260 \nSeptember, but aboveground biomass was always higher in June than in September. We 261 \ntherefore only present results based on the annual sums. There were no significant differences in 262 \nproductivity between plots designated for the different treatments before the long term treatments 263 \nstarted (2002 harvest, data not shown). Plant species richness and productivity of the grassland 264 \nsites were not correlated in any year. When analyzing the untreated control plots of all sites, 265 \nproductivity tended to decrease with increasing species richness, but the correlation was not 266 \nsignificant (2002-2006, Pearson\u2019s r: -0.38 <r < -0.23, 0.20 < P < 0.43). 267 \n 268 \nEffects of herbivore exclusion on aboveground biomass 269 \nAboveground biomass was not influenced consistently by either the aboveground treatment or 270 \nthe belowground treatment (Tab. 1). There was a highly significant interaction between the 271 \nbelowground treatment and time, indicating that the effect of belowground herbivores depended 272 \non conditions of the particular year. This is, for instance, reflected by the negative effect of soil 273 \npesticide application on aboveground biomass in 2003 and its positive effect in 2004, while there 274 \nwere no significant effects in 2005 (Fig. 1). Across all years and sites, the average effect of 275 \npesticide application on aboveground biomass was close to zero (mean lnRRB = -0.01) which is 276 \nin line with the results of the repeated measures ANOVA (Tab. 1). However, as individual 277 \ngrasslands responded quite differently, ranging from negative to positive responses (-0.25 to 278 \n0.32) we used a repeated measures analysis to investigate whether this variation in responses 279 \ncould be explained by the diversity and productivity of the grasslands.  280 \n16 \nAnalysing the effects of diversity and productivity on herbivore impact separately, 281 \nrevealed that the response of aboveground biomass to pesticide application was significantly 282 \npositively correlated with plant species richness (F1,11 = 10.59, P<0.007), i.e. invertebrate 283 \nherbivory had a positive effect on biomass in low diversity grasslands and a negative effect in 284 \nmore diverse sites (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the response to pesticides was significantly negatively 285 \ncorrelated with site productivity (F1,11 = 6.75, P<0.025), i.e. herbivory had a negative effect on 286 \nplant community biomass in sites with generally low productivity and a positive effect in sites 287 \nwith high productivity. We found no evidence for a unimodal relationship between herbivore 288 \nimpact and productivity. However, the significant effect of site productivity vanished when 289 \nincluded together with plant diversity in the model (Tab. 2), which points to collinearity between 290 \nthese two variables. The conclusion is that the response of plant community biomass to 291 \ninvertebrate herbivore exclusion was depended on plant species richness but not on site 292 \nproductivity (Fig. 2, Tab. 2).  293 \n 294 \nEffects of herbivore exclusion on plant diversity and plant species composition 295 \nThere were consistent and significant effects of belowground herbivore exclusion on plant 296 \nspecies richness. Exclusion of belowground herbivory significantly decreased plant species 297 \nrichness by 1.44 \u00b1 0.15 (mean \u00b1 SE) species m-2, averaged across all years and study sites (Tab. 298 \n1, Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the aboveground treatment did not significantly affect species 299 \nrichness, and we found no interaction between the two treatments (Tab. 1, Fig. 3a). Evenness 300 \nwas significantly reduced by the combined treatment, but responses of evenness to the 301 \naboveground or belowground treatments were more variable (Fig. 3b). The fact that the effect of 302 \n17 \nthe combined treatment was much higher than the sum of the effects of individual treatments on 303 \ntheir own indicates that the two pesticides acted synergistically rather than additively which is 304 \nalso expressed by the significant interaction term (Tab. 1). Time-treatment interactions were not 305 \nsignificant (Tab. 1). 306 \nThe treatments significantly influenced plant species composition, measured as change in 307 \ncover of the different plant functional groups. In particular the exclusion of belowground 308 \nherbivores caused a significant increase in the cover of grasses by 31.25 \u00b1 2.63% (mean 309 \naveraged over all study sites and years \u00b1 SE) and a significant decrease in the cover of erosulate 310 \nherbs by 3.14 \u00b1 0.68% (mean averaged over all study sites and years \u00b1 SE) whereas the cover of 311 \nrosette and hemirosette herbs as well as of legumes was not affected (Tab. 1, Fig. 4, Appendix 1 312 \nfor plant functional groups). By contrast, the aboveground treatment had no effect on cover of 313 \nany functional group, and there was no interaction between the belowground and aboveground 314 \ntreatments. 315 \n Because evenness was most strongly affected by the combined treatment (Fig. 3b), we 316 \nanalyzed the response of individual plant species for this treatment only. The analysis of the log 317 \nresponse ratios (lnRRC) of the 37 most frequent plant species revealed that, averaged across all 318 \nstudy sites and years, two species were significantly positively affected and seven species were 319 \nsignificantly negatively affected by the combined treatment (Fig. 5). The two positively affected 320 \nspecies are the grass Festuca rubra and the legume Vicia cracca. Four of the seven negatively 321 \naffected species are hemirosette herbs. This result seems to contradict the results from the 322 \nrepeated measure ANOVAs, which revealed no significant response of the functional group of 323 \nhemirosette forbs (Tab. 1). Log response ratios of individual plant species to pesticide 324 \napplication increased significantly with their abundance (F1, 189 = 3.98, P<0.05). Although 325 \n18 \naverage species responses differed between the study sites (F13, 189 = 3.68, P<0.001), dominant 326 \nspecies showed a consistently stronger response than less abundant species in all study sites 327 \n(interaction site x abundance not significant: F13, 189 = 1.52, P=0.12).  328 \n329 \n19 \nDISCUSSION 330 \nOver a period of five years, we excluded above- and belowground herbivores from 14 331 \nextensively managed grasslands along existing gradients of plant diversity and productivity in 332 \ncentral Germany. Our first hypothesis, that invertebrate herbivores generally decrease 333 \naboveground biomass, was not confirmed (Tab. 1, Fig. 1). In accordance with our second 334 \nhypothesis, invertebrate herbivores had a positive effect on plant species diversity as pesticide 335 \napplication reduced both plant species richness and evenness (Tab. 1, Fig. 3). This particularly 336 \napplied to the exclusion of belowground herbivores which shifted plant functional composition 337 \ntowards grasses at the expense of erosulate herbs. Our third hypothesis, that the effect of 338 \nherbivory on aboveground biomass decreases with increasing plant diversity and is strongest at 339 \nintermediate levels of primary productivity was also not confirmed. In contrast to our 340 \nexpectation, productivity did not have a significant impact on the effect of herbivory. The impact 341 \nof plant species richness was surprising: the effect of herbivore exclusion on plant community 342 \nbiomass was positively correlated with plant species richness, with negative effects at sites of 343 \nlow diversity and positive at sites of high plant diversity. To our knowledge such a strong 344 \nconnection of plant species richness to the effects of invertebrate herbivores on plant 345 \ncommunities has never been shown before. In the following, we will discuss experimental 346 \nrestrictions of our study, explore possible mechanisms behind our findings and outline their 347 \nimplications for biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. 348 \nFirst, we would like to emphasize that invertebrate exclusion experiments are likely to 349 \nunderestimate the real effects of herbivory, as the use of pesticides under field conditions usually 350 \ndoes not result in a complete exclusion of invertebrates (see Coupe & Cahill 2003) - even when, 351 \nas in our study, they are applied frequently at high dosages just below the maximum 352 \n20 \nrecommended dosage. In our experiment, pesticides were effective in reducing insect density. 353 \nOur sites were mown twice a year, consequently there was no dense litter layer present 354 \npreventing pesticides from penetrating the soil. Extraction of soil invertebrates, carried out 355 \naccordingly to McFadyen (1962) and Kempson et al. (1963), revealed that the belowground 356 \ntreatment was effective at least to a depth of 10 cm: we found that soil pesticide application 357 \nreduced abundance of soil invertebrates by 46% (excluding Collembola, Wilcoxon signed-rank 358 \ntest, P = 0.036) and also caused a decrease in the overall number of invertebrate taxa found in the 359 \nsoil by 47% (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.016, Stein et al., unpublished data). These data 360 \nhighlight the above mentioned fact that the application of pesticides does not result in a complete 361 \nexclusion of herbivores. Instead, by applying pesticides one rather compares the effect of an 362 \nintact herbivore community with that of a resistant subcommunity. A general weakness of using 363 \npesticides are potential side effects, such as physiological effects on plant growth. However, 364 \ngreenhouse experiments on a large number of plant species have shown that direct effects of the 365 \npesticides used in our study on plant performance are negligible (Hector et al. 2004) or 366 \nnonexistent (Sch\u00e4dler et al. 2004b, Auge, unpublished data). A further complication of pesticide 367 \nuse is that all insects and not just herbivores are killed by these pesticides, possibly masking the 368 \npotential role of herbivores: when herbivores are normally controlled by parasitoids and 369 \npredators, pesticide use will result in no changes for the plant community (Siemann et al. 2004). 370 \nFinally, invertebrate decomposers and plant nutrient availability may also be affected by 371 \npesticide use (Siemann et al. 2004, Sch\u00e4dler et al. 2004a, Fountain et al. 2007). In our study, the 372 \nchanges observed in the cover of plant functional groups could have been the result of a 373 \nfertilization effect due to the killing of belowground insects. In this case, however, we would 374 \nhave expected a simultaneous increase in aboveground biomass, which was not observed. In 375 \n21 \naddition, such a fertilization effect would have been expected to be strongest in the first year of 376 \napplication and much lower in subsequent years, when the insecticide treatment would have 377 \nkilled eggs and small larvae early in their development. Even though we did not detect negative 378 \neffects of pesticides on the density of Collembola (Stein et al., unpublished data), there might be 379 \neffects on the dominance structure of the decomposer community as it has been shown in an old 380 \nfield (Endlweber et al. 2006). Despite potential side effects, and even with the appropriate 381 \ncaution in interpreting chains of causation, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that 382 \nthe use of pesticides is a valuable tool for studying herbivore effects in terrestrial ecosystems 383 \n(Siemann et al. 2004). Furthermore, pesticides are so far the only way to selectively reduce 384 \nabundance of belowground insects, and hence insect herbivory, under natural conditions. Based 385 \non the arguments above, we feel certain that our results are, at least for the most part, reflecting 386 \nthe effects of invertebrate herbivores rather than possible side effects of pesticides. 387 \nBelowground invertebrates significantly affected plant diversity and functional group 388 \ncomposition of the investigated 14 grasslands. In response to the exclusion of belowground 389 \ninvertebrates plant species richness and evenness decreased. This is in line with the conceptual 390 \nframework proposed by Hillebrand et al. (2007) who suggested that in communities where 391 \nproductivity and dominance are high herbivores have a positive effect on plant species richness 392 \nand evenness. The dominant plant species in our sites, the grasses, became more dominant when 393 \nbelowground herbivores were excluded and erosulate herbs declined. However, an analysis of 394 \nthe response of the most abundant plant species revealed that several hemirosette herbs were also 395 \nsignificantly affected (Fig. 5). Thus, the definition of functional groups based on one single 396 \nattribute \u2013 in our case growth form \u2013 is obviously not sufficient to predict plant species response 397 \nto invertebrate herbivory (Petchey 2004). One potential mechanism underlying the positive effect 398 \n22 \nof the soil insecticide on grasses could be that belowground herbivores may generally be less 399 \nspecialized than aboveground herbivores (Crawley 1983, Lal 2006 but see also) (Blossey and 400 \nHunt-Joshi 2003), and feed as a consequence on the roots that are most abundant. Since grasses 401 \ntypically have more extensive root systems than herbs (e.g., Kutschera 1960), they are also more 402 \nexposed to belowground herbivory and would consequently benefit most from the exclusion of 403 \nbelowground herbivory. While many grass species increased in cover, several grasses such as 404 \nHolcus lanatus or Arrhenaterum elatius did not increase, suggesting at least some specificity in 405 \nthe herbivore effect. In contrast to our study, previous investigations have found a promotion of 406 \nherbs in response to belowground herbivore exclusion (Brown and Gange 1989b, Brown and 407 \nGange 1992). However, those studies were conducted in early successional plant communities in 408 \nwhich herbs represented the most abundant group, which is consistent with our hypothesis that 409 \nbelowground herbivores are affecting the most abundant species in a community. In accordance 410 \nwith this hypothesis, we found a consistently positive relationship between response to herbivory 411 \nand abundance of individual plant species across our study sites. There is a clear need for further 412 \nstudies distinguishing whether the effect of belowground herbivores is driven by their preference 413 \nfor particular plant species or by plant abundance. 414 \nEffects of invertebrate herbivory on aboveground biomass were small and inconsistent 415 \nwhen averaged across the 14 sites. Our findings support a recent meta-analysis (Sch\u00e4dler et al. 416 \n2003) that also demonstrated high variability in effect size when insects and\/or molluscs were 417 \nexcluded in field experiments. Interestingly, however, in our experiment, 42% of the variance in 418 \nthe aboveground biomass response to invertebrate herbivory could be attributed to plant species 419 \nrichness in the study sites. Remarkably, invertebrate herbivory tended to have a positive effect on 420 \nbiomass in low diversity grasslands and a negative effect in more diverse sites, thus excluding 421 \n23 \ninvertebrates using pesticides led to an increase in aboveground biomass only in the more diverse 422 \nsites (Fig. 2). Such a pattern was not reported in a recent meta-analysis of insect effects on 423 \nprimary productivity in different herbaceous communities (Coupe and Cahill 2003). Using 424 \nexperimental grassland, Mulder et al. (1999) also found that more diverse grasslands gained 425 \nmore biomass when herbivores were excluded but there was no indication of a negative effect of 426 \npesticide use on biomass use in low-diversity mixtures. In a different grassland biodiversity 427 \nexperiment, Scherber et al. (2006) found no increase in herbivore damage of individual plants 428 \nacross a gradient of 1 to 60 plant species. A previous study carried out in the same grasslands 429 \nthat were used in the present study showed that damage caused by aboveground feeding 430 \ninvertebrate herbivores, measured as percent leaf area removed, did decrease with increasing 431 \nplant species richness (Unsicker et al. 2006). However, the same study indicated that herbivory 432 \nwas mainly due to generalist rather than specialist herbivores, with aphids being the most 433 \nabundant group. These and other results show that (1) the mechanisms that are hypothesized to 434 \nlead to a decrease in herbivore impact with increasing plant diversity (Pimentel 1961, Root 1973) 435 \ndo not appear to apply universally and need to be studied in more detail, (2) herbivory as 436 \nmeasured as leaf area loss or related quantities does not necessarily reflect herbivore impact at 437 \nthe community level as plants may compensate for damage and differ in their response to it, (3) 438 \ninsect abundance data or herbivore load may likewise be only poor predictors of herbivore effect 439 \nat the plant community level. Unfortunately, in order to understand how plant diversity 440 \ninfluences herbivore effects on the plant community it appears to be necessary to measure 441 \nsimultaneously the response of both generalist and specialist herbivores (and their natural 442 \nenemies) to plant species richness, the resulting impact on individual plant species, and the 443 \nconsequences at the community level. Such comprehensive studies have not been performed and 444 \n24 \nour study also falls short of measuring all of these parameters. Studying herbivore effects on 445 \nplant-plant competition in detail in differently diverse plant communities may be very rewarding 446 \nas our study indicates that even an increase in community biomass under herbivory is possible 447 \nwhen species richness is low.  448 \nThe effect of invertebrate herbivores on aboveground biomass was not related to the 449 \nproductivity of the plant communities. In contrast to previous studies (Fraser and Grime 1997, 450 \nFraser 1998) our results are not consistent with the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis (Fretwell 451 \n1977, Oksanen et al. 1981, Fretwell 1987, Oksanen 1990). Instead, they support the suggestion 452 \nthat this model does not apply to invertebrates (Sch\u00e4dler et al. 2003). For large mammalian 453 \nherbivores, Chase et al. (2000) have shown a decline in the effect size of herbivores on 454 \naboveground biomass with increasing productivity of the plant communities. However, our study 455 \nsuggests that effect size of invertebrate herbivores is controlled by plant diversity rather than 456 \nproductivity. 457 \nOur results emphasize the fact that invertebrate herbivores affect ecosystem functioning 458 \n(Weisser and Siemann 2004). However, in the studied grasslands, these effects varied with 459 \nspecific ecosystem characteristics (plant diversity), and depended on the type of herbivory (i.e. 460 \naboveground versus belowground herbivory). At our study sites, the effects of aboveground 461 \nherbivores were generally small in comparison to those of belowground herbivores. In 462 \ncombination, above- and belowground herbivory seemed to affect plant diversity only in terms of 463 \nevenness synergistically rather than additively. This is in line with the results of previous studies 464 \nin early successional plant communities where observed effects were additive (Brown and Gange 465 \n1989b). Our results indicate that belowground herbivores can be important drivers in semi-466 \nnatural grasslands. Since the main effect of invertebrate herbivory might be on root biomass (but 467 \n25 \nsee McNaughton et al. 1998), future studies should in particular examine belowground primary 468 \nproductivity.  469 \n 470 \nIn conclusion, our results show that invertebrate herbivores can affect ecosystem 471 \nprocesses under field conditions, and that effect sizes can depend on species diversity of the plant 472 \ncommunity. Furthermore, our results indicate that the influence of herbivores on a plant 473 \ncommunity does not necessarily become evident in aboveground biomass. Instead, plant 474 \ncommunity composition measured as the contribution of plant functional groups to the 475 \ncommunity, was more strongly affected by our treatments than total aboveground biomass. 476 \nFuture studies should therefore include more measures of ecosystem functioning, and not just 477 \naboveground biomass. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of longer-term studies. 478 \nWhile the effect of the combined treatment on evenness was already visible within one year of 479 \nstudy, the effects on productivity were quite variable so that the conclusions would have been 480 \ndifferent had our study stopped after only one or two years (Figs. 2, 4). Because effects can be 481 \nsubtle and may be influenced by interannual variation in temperature and rainfall patterns, short-482 \nterm studies may fail to elucidate such effects.  483 \n 484 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS 485 \nToo many people to name individually helped in collecting and processing data over the years, 486 \nwe thank them all.
