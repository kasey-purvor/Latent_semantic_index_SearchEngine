Authors from sixty different countries successfully \nsubmitted papers, with particularly strong representation from China, Brazil, Russia and Turkey (Fig. 1.).

Geographical distribution of papers submitted for Planning and Geohazards Theme. \n \nSESSION DISCUSSION \nMost of the discussion centred on the assessment and management of hazard and risk. Increasing frequency of natural \ndisasters was acknowledged as an alarming and challenging development all over the world, especially in less \ndeveloped nations. It was highlighted that the causes for this are complex. The discussion included anecdotal reports \nto support an increasing temporal frequency of high magnitude hazard events \u2013 a pattern that may be related to climate \nchange and other phenomena. Importantly, population rise means that many areas of urbanization are now \nencroaching into marginally or entirely unsuitable land. The exposure to hazards and vulnerability of people, housing, \nindustry and infrastructure are increasing. Poor planning and inferior construction in poorer and less developed \ncountries increase their vulnerability and the consequences of hazard events. The discussion concentrated on the fact \nthat, with these two trends, an increase in frequency and magnitude of urban disasters is bound to occur.  \n \nRisk \u2018management\u2019 carried out after an event often proves to be inadequate in the short-term and ineffective or even \ncounter-productive in the long-term. Often, significant losses from a natural disaster are followed, after another few \nyears, by a disaster of comparable or greater severity. Thus, there is an urgent need for more innovative approaches to \nhazard assessment and to risk management. Importantly, urgent consideration must be given to 'preventative risk \nmanagement'. This should include careful planning for the medium to long-term, strict control on the extent and \nintensity of development, appropriate instrumentation and monitoring, early warning systems and a variety of \nengineered solutions to specific problems. Adoption of such measures in advance of the occurrence of potential \nnatural events would, of course, involve significant expenditure but this should be presented as key investment, the \nbenefits of which could be enormous. Conversely, failure to invest will result in lost opportunity and potentially \ncatastrophic loss. \n \nIt was broadly agreed that preventative risk management incorporating a variety of tools, techniques and \nmethodologies should be adopted for reducing the frequency and severity of disasters and other adverse natural events. \nEven for a strategy embracing 'preventive risk management', it is necessary to put in place a reliable hazard-\nvulnerability-consequence framework. It was agreed that engineering geologists have a crucial role in this process. \nHowever, to maximise the benefit to the community, engineering geologists must continue to develop new avenues of \ncommunication, working alongside planners, economists or politicians. \nTable 1.

Most concentrate on building seismic hazard \nscenarios at a city scale, using microzonation and GIS techniques. Maksud Kamal & Midorikawa (2009) described a \nmicrozonation study for Dhaka, Bangladesh. Combining a new geomorphological model with the results of a seismic \nvelocity survey of the city, they were able to define three areas where ground conditions and building height combined \nto form discrete areas of relatively high risk. The results of their study have been used to support a proposed process to \nretrofit buildings at particular risk. Similarly, a study by Kocbay & Orhan (2009) highlighted areas where the weak \nnature of lake sediments near Lake Efteni, Turkey, resulted in an increased liquefaction potential.  \n \nSeveral studies were presented concerned with establishing ground motion amplification patterns associated with \nsuperficial or artificial deposits. Ohta et al. (2009) developed a model utilising borehole records and other information \nto assess liquefaction potential for the city of Takamstsu, Japan. This study was supported by that of Saito et al. \n(2009), which described how shallow seismic techniques were used to supplement the borehole information. Their \ntechnique determined the S-wave velocity profile of the ground using the response from an artificial seismic source. \nAlthough the depth of investigation is limited and reliant upon a fair understanding of the subsurface environment, it is \nnon-invasive, compact and cheap. Results presented showed that S-wave profiles related to channel fill or \nembankments comprising weathered granite were clearly identifiable. \n \nRebolledo et al. (2009) described a study centred on the city of Santiago, Chile and sought to understand anomalous \npatterns of damage observed following a M 7.8 earthquake in 1985. They presented results from a geotechnical and \ngeophysical investigation, which established a clear ground motion amplification pattern in areas where thick \nignimbrite and pyroclastic flow deposits were underlain by fine grained soils. Pergalani & Compagnoni (2009) \nclassified characteristic geological profiles in Lombardia, Italy, according to their likely response to a seismic event. \nAn extensive programme of laboratory testing and modelling of subsurface profiles identified three characteristic \nsuccessions, of which \u2018silt with clay\u2019 was the most susceptible to ground motion amplification.  \n \nLiquefaction of alluvial sediments on the shore of Lake Sapanca, Turkey following the Kocaeli earthquake of 1999 \nwas described by Kanibir et al. (2009). Substantial damage was caused to buildings, lifelines and other structures, \nmany of which were affected by lateral spreading towards the lake. They developed a series of empirical models based \nupon seismological, topographical and soil property data, which accurately simulated observed ground deformation.  \n \nOther researchers drew attention to areas where the seismic hazard may be underestimated and further research is \nrequired, often because the regional model of seismicity does not take local conditions into account. Ghanbari & Jalili \n(2009) reconsidered the earthquakes affecting the North Tabriz fault, which is rupturing progressively in a westward \ndirection. Their assessment of the seismic history of the fault since the 17th Century suggested a recurrence interval for \ndestructive earthquakes that would justify the microzonation of Tabriz and other cities within Azerbaijan, regions of \nthe Caspian basin and Iran. The related study by Ghanbari et al. (2009) supported this research. \u00c7abalar (2009) \nconsidered the possibility that existing seismic models of Gaziantep, Turkey, might underestimate the hazard posed by \nthe Dead Sea Fault Zone as well as the more heavily studied North Anatolian Fault. Jamali et al. (2009) presented a \npreliminary evaluation of the seismic hazard in Fujairah Emirate and recommend further study.  \n \nFenton (2009) highlighted the need, in many instances, to consider site-specific hazard. He presented a methodology \nthat can be applied when a detailed site study to properly establish the 3D architecture of a rupture system is not \nfeasible. The technique described takes advantage of the fact that, in tectonically active regions, surface faulting often \noccurs on existing faults, with deformation reducing with distance from the rupture. His paper demonstrated that a \nrupture zone map, indicating probability and extents of movement, can be made using pre-existing records and, \ncrucially, professional judgement. The maps have been used to communicate the problem to engineers, aiding the \ndesign of seismic protection features. As with many papers presented and accepted in this theme, the solution was a \npragmatic compromise which seeks to reduce risks using the best available information. \n \nLANDSLIDES AND EROSION \nLandslide specific studies included that of Zhou (2009), who described a case study for the Baota landslide on the \nbanks of the Yangtze River, China. This ancient landslide has been subject to local reactivations since 1984 and poses \n 3 \na significant threat to several new developments. An extensive monitoring programme was developed that used \nseveral different techniques, with special attention paid to groundwater. Careful monitoring of pore-water pressure, \ntemperature and chemistry revealed a complex relationship between movement, rainfall and the elevation of the river. \nThe Three Gorges Dam has been designed to enable annual fluctuations in water depth of up to 45 m, to allow safe \nentrapment of flood waters. Aware of the potential impact of this variation in head on the stability of pre-existing \nlandslides, Mo & Yuhu (2009) carried out a detailed study along a stretch of land containing a selected number of \nlandslides. Computer modelling of slope stability along this stretch under different scenarios was used to inform local \ndevelopment plans. \n \nZen\u00f3bio & Zuquette (2009) described work to help engineers and planners involved in the expansion of urban zones \ninto unstable, weathered slopes in the Serra de Ouro Preto region in Brazil. They carried out extensive geotechnical \nmapping and geotechnical testing of materials and combined these with assessments of natural slope instability to \nproduce zoning charts for use by non-geological professionals. The Sao Pedro and Barra Bonita region of Sao Paulo is \nextensively affected by landslides, gulleying and soil loss. Ferreira & Pejon (2009) described how an understanding of \nthese issues required an extensive knowledge of the engineering geology and hydrogeology in the three separate \nwatersheds. \n \nKARST \nSchmitz & Schroeder (2009) presented two case studies of how early involvement in construction projects by \nengineering geologists has greatly assisted in major construction projects in karst terrains. One of these involved the \nSoumagne tunnel, part of a new railroad from Brussels, via Li\u00e8ge and Aachen, to Cologne. The tunnel cut through a \nseries of limestones known to show palaeokarst. Site investigation techniques included borehole, geophysical, \ngeotechnical and hydrological measurements, a pilot gallery, microgravimetric measurements and advance drilling. \nThe basic ground model was applied to determine appropriate site investigation and construction techniques to \nidentify potential karst problems for the duration of the construction project.  \n \nT\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. (2009) presented a review of the impact of karst on cities and went on to compare the relative impact of \nkarst in Hungary and Greece. The comparison is a useful one, as it allows comparison between Hungary, affected by a \nrelatively small area (4.4%) of uncovered karst, as opposed to a country which has nearly a third of its surface area \ncovered by limestone but with a generally subsurface karst. They described the major engineering challenges posed by \nsubsurface karst that often lead to water intrusion, overbreaks, instabilities and other challenges. For the examples \npresented, they demonstrated that Greek karst is often related to discontinuity-controlled water flow or instability, \nwhereas the karst of Hungary is more closely related to the drawdown of the water table caused by urban expansion. \nThe difficulty of assessing thermal karst, which develops upwards and shows very little surface expression until a \ncollapse occurs, was also described.  \n \nAnikeev (2009) carried out a series of experiments to investigate the phenomenon of spalling and fissuring of clay \nmaterials, which form caps to many karstic voids and fissures and are the main cause of sinkhole generation in a zone \nof the pre-glacial Moscow river valley. Through a long-standing research programme they have identified a chain of \nhydrological, suffosion and stress-relief processes that contribute to karst activity and are contributing to a better \nunderstanding of the subsidence in the north-west district of Moscow. \n \nSETTLEMENT AND SUBSIDENCE \nRuilin (2009) presented an excellent and detailed review of urban land subsidence in China. He showed that at least \neleven cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin and Suzhou have had an accumulative subsidence of greater than 1 m at \ntheir subsidence centres. The primary cause of the problem is withdrawal of groundwater by urban and industrial \nconsumers. Although many lessons were leant from these experiences, the author described how the expansion of new \nindustrial cities, currently of \u201cmedian-size\u201d is expected to lead to similar problems over the next few decades. \n \nA different aspect of subsidence was explored by Ajalloeian et al. (2009). They described ground fissuring related to \nsubsidence in the northern Mahyar plain, Iran, which has caused damage to houses, agriculture and highways for the \npast thirty years. Although the groundwater extraction, which caused the subsidence, had slowed since 1991, ground \nfissuring had continued. Using 3D modelling techniques, they were able to establish a relationship between the \nthicknesses of clay units at depth, with the pattern of surface fissuring. \n \nCOLLAPSIBLE SOILS \nDe Oliveira et al. (2009). Described how the town of Solteira, Brazil, originally conceived as a temporary \ndevelopment, was built on deposits with a high collapse potential. As the town outgrew its expected lifetime and \nserviceability, the water supply and sewerage systems leaked, triggering collapses. A risk map was designed from the \nresults of geological and engineering geological mapping, geotechnical testing, a damage register, and resident \ninterviews. A generalized version presented as a risk register map has been used to support maintenance schedules and \nto raise awareness amongst those affected. \n 4 \n \nVOLCANIC HAZARDS \nDonnelly et al. (2009) presented an excellent case study of how engineering geology has proved invaluable to the \nmitigation of volcanic, seismic and landslide hazards on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. The Soufri\u00e8re Hills \nvolcano has been in a state of eruption for ten years, necessitating the evacuation of the majority of islanders and \nrelocation of primary infrastructure. A review of activities since 1995 demonstrated how volcanic risk maps of the \nisland have evolved with changing volcanic activity and population. \n \nWilliams et al. (2009) described a volcanic problem of distinctly different scale and nature to that of Montserrat, the \npotentially active Auckland Volcanic Field, upon which the metropolitan area of Auckland (population 1.3 million), \nNew Zealand stands. Unlike the relatively well-defined hazards described by Donnelly et al. (2009), engineering \ngeologists in Auckland are faced with volcanic hazards that might exhibit uncertain spatial extent and little antecedent \nactivity. There is also the likelihood of an extended period of eruption, complex secondary hazards and a relatively \nunprepared urban area. To counter this potential threat, a volcanic contingency plan has been prepared. The plan \nincludes transparent policies for a warning system, scenario-driven models of hazard and risk, protocols for civil \nemergency, the allocation of resources and an education programme. \n \nRADON \nOnly one paper, by Miklyaev & Petrova (2009), was presented on radon hazards. They described a new hazard map \nfor Moscow which combines analyses of radon readings with new engineering geological maps. A survey was carried \nout in the 1990s that showed 68% of city inhabitants were exposed to doses exceeding 20 mSv\/year (the dose limit for \nprofessionals). Comparison between measured levels of radon and engineering geological maps of the city showed \nthat areas of high radon readings correlated with areas underlain by clay strata. Investigation of these results revealed \nthat the elevated readings were not because of specific radiative sources but were the effect of high background levels \nresulting from elevated levels within clay strata. Hence, the engineering geological map provided a good indication of \nthe radon hazard in the city. \n \nHAZARD TO RISK \nA significant theme of the papers submitted to congress was the prevalence of risk-based methodologies and the \npragmatic approach required for such research. Risk methodologies are crucial to provide comparisons of vulnerability \nacross different hazards and at different scales. Asef (2009) presented an excellent paper that used a normalized scale \nthat expressed the relative impact of earthquakes in different countries. He used this national earthquake vulnerability \nindex to assess and rank 35 nations according to their vulnerability. In every analysis, Iran was demonstrably the \nnation most vulnerable to earthquakes. Other highly vulnerable countries in the list were China, Turkey, Italy, Japan, \nand Indonesia. \n \nMany obstacles are currently in place for those attempting quantitative risk analysis. Miner & Dahlhaus (2009) \ndemonstrated that the wide range of methodologies available to risk assessment means that it is difficult to compare \nthe results of different studies. Whitworth et al. (2009) showed that many methodologies are biased towards urbanised \nareas, to the detriment of rural locations. Ast\u00e9 (2009) described some of the problems of obtaining and using \nquantitative economic data as the basis for an assessment. He proposed that the standardised collation of such \ninformation is crucial to ensure compatibility with other assessments and application to other uses. Russian legislation \nwill require a risk-based assessment within building design by 2010. Ragozin et al. (2009) described progress towards \nthis and how many large or critical constructions have already been assessed in this way. However, they still highlight \nthe significant difficulties in obtaining data for such calculations and non-standardised mechanism of calculating risks. \nThe notion of collecting simple, standardised, updateable data to support risk assessment was further emphasised by \nCastro Junior (2009) and Marchiori-Faria et al. (2009). The latter of these studies also demonstrated the value of \nremote sensing information as a way of achieving this and of enabling simple risk zonation.  \n \nURBANIZATION AS A CAUSE\/TRIGGER \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, urbanization is repeatedly shown to be the cause of, or contributing factor to, many hazardous \nsituations. Ragozin et al. (2009) described how less than 1% of urbanized areas in Russia were affected by rising \ngroundwater levels in the late 1950s, yet currently the figure stands at about 20%, and how over 40 karst collapses \nhave been recorded in Moscow since the 1960s, whereas prior to that, they were unknown. Zhang et al. (2009) \nexplained how water extraction, alongside undermining, has exacerbated subsidence in Nanjing, China. \n \nAccording to Makovetsky (2009) leakage from water pipes from a large Russian city could total 10,000 m3 per day, \nand can cause significant problems. This situation has been exacerbated by the widespread cessation of maintenance in \nthe 1990s, contributing to 960 out of 1092 cities suffering groundwater flooding. The flooding is associated with \nsecondary hazards including suffosion, instability, chemistry changes, increased dampness, and aggressive ground \nconditions. Ragozin (1994) suggested that damage from suffosion, alone, can be observed in 958 towns and cities \nacross Russia, with an approximate annual average economic cost of about $0.5bn at 1990 prices. Khomenko (2009) \nrelated these failures directly to leakage. De Oliveira et al. (2009) described how leaking pipes (that have exceeded \n 5 \ntheir design capacity and lifetime) have caused extensive soil collapse in Solteira, Brazil. Zuquette & Palma (2009) \ndemonstrated how the pattern of infiltration and overland flow in the C\u00f3rrego do Va\u00e7ununga basin, S\u00e3o Paulo, had \nbeen altered by changes in land-use. \n \nThe seismic vulnerability of the Anthoupoli district, Athens, has been exacerbated by extensive undermining by coal \nextraction. Rozos & Kynigalaki (2009) described how damage caused by earthquakes in 1981 and 1999 were more \nserious here than elsewhere in the region. Extensive research, including data review and widespread ground \ninvestigation, has been carried out to determine the extent of the problem. The results of this have been output as a risk \nmap, building guidance and a list of areas where microzonation would be appropriate. This research also highlights the \nproblems of elderly building stock which may not have always been properly maintained, a point reinforced by \nPetermans et al. (2009). \n \nSome authors presented studies where significant geohazard impacts have been factored in to development plans. \nHuang et al. (2009) showed that the city of Kunming, China, is expected to expand from 180 km2 in 2003 to 460 km2. \nThis will involve the \u2018consumption\u2019 of all available flat lying areas of lake sediments in the vicinity and will \ndrastically change the local hydrological regime, including cutting the entire supply of water to Lake Dianchi. It is \nanticipated that subsidence will affect 3681 km2, severely affecting the groundwater system in the West Sichuan Plain. \nThe effects of this subsidence will be irreversible. Similarly, the development of the Three Gorges dam has required \nthe relocation of an entire town within an area prone to multiple hazards. Wu et al. (2009) described some of the \nengineering geological investigations carried out to support such development. \n \nURBAN GEOHAZARD PLANNING \nA range of methods were described by which engineering geological expertise could help planners and developers to \nbetter manage geohazards in urban areas. The largest, in terms of scale at least, was presented by Zhang et al. (2009), \nwho described the mechanisms used to manage hazards in Nanjing City, which, in the future, is expected cover an area \nof 6516 km2. The city is affected by landslides, subsidence, undermining, karst and fluvial erosion. Planners have \ndivided the city into 6000 1 km2 pixels, each of which is attributed in a Geographical Information System (GIS) with \ninformation on geological, soil, groundwater and hazards information. This grid was analysed using an Analytic \nHierarchy Process to determine the requirements of different land uses and then by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, \nopportunities and threats) analysis to determine appropriate land-use. The city has been divided into areas which are \nconsidered suitable for industrial usage, human habitation, port\/parking or commerce.  \n \nRichards & Brynard (2009) presented an excellent paper that described the recently launched National Geohazard \nSystem for the Republic of South Africa. The system has been designed to meet the increasing needs of planners, \ndevelopers and insurers in that country and utilises extensive data holdings maintained by the national geological \ninstitute\/survey. Interestingly, this paper also goes into some detail regarding the technical, legal and financial issues \nraised by data-driven national scale assessments. \n \nAt all scales, the input of engineering geologists to urban geohazard management seems increasingly to be through the \nmedium of GIS. Amongst the advantages of GIS described were: dealing with multiple hazards (for example, Zuquette \n& Palma 2009, Ferrer et al. 2009), the joining of disparate data (for example, Ben-David & Nachmias 2009, Saket & \nAghda 2009), the ability to incorporate a decision support or warning system (Osipov et al. 2009) and the ease with \nwhich systems can be modified or updated (Ferreira & Pejon 2009).  \n \nCrucially, GIS allows extrapolation of scientific judgement across wider geographical areas (Baptista 2009;  Ferrer et \nal. 2009) or the adaptation of engineering advice to answer new questions. This last point was well illustrated by \nWassing & Van Der Krogt (2009) who stressed that the final product of an engineering geological survey should not \nbe an engineering geological report or map, but an output designed around, and often made with the input of, the end-\nuser. In this example, thematic \"subsurface suitability maps\" are presented that depict the suitability of areas for a \ncertain spatial development based upon geological and socio-economic data. \n \nHowever, it was clear that GIS is just one tool available to the engineering geologist and the method is reliant upon \nlarge amounts of data and expertise (Fall et al. 2006). Although most papers in this theme did in some way use GIS, \nthe outputs described included engineering reports, design charts, guidance documents, maps, databases and education \nprogrammes. Konno & Nakasato (2009) described a programme of works centred on Sendai City in northeast Japan. \nMany developments in the city are built on soft foundations and are expected to be affected by an earthquake within \nthe next 30 years. A major initiative to minimize the effects of future events is educating members of the general \npublic. This has involved a series of public lectures and workshops which, over time, will build the knowledge of \ndifferent sectors of the community and, importantly, give opportunities for feedback. Of particular interest has been \nthe opportunity of participants in the scheme to create their own hazard maps \u2013 truly involving them in the hazard \nmanagement process. \n 6 \n \nRETROFITTING FOR GEOHAZARDS \nSeveral papers presented research attempting to retrospectively adapt city infrastructure or planning policy (for \nexample, Forster et al. 2009, Maksud Kamal & Midorikawal 2009, De Oliveira et al. 2009). Loupasakis & Karfakis \n(2009) described how many long-abandoned limestone quarries across Greece are subject to instability, usually in the \nform of rockfalls. Problems have arisen where these spaces have been used as public recreation areas. They \nhighlighted a number of areas where engineering geological assessments have been required to retrospectively propose \nengineering or management solutions to cope with slope instability hazards.  \n \nGround improvement in urban areas often requires special procedures that minimise disruption to surrounding \ndevelopments or infrastructure. Serridge & Synac (2009) described their Rapid Impact Compaction (RIC) technique, \nwhere a relatively light rig applies blows to the ground in rapid fashion. In the case studies presented, this meant that \nground could be compacted in close proximity to existing buildings. They also suggested that the technique could be \nuseful in areas where removal of material from the ground would mean handling contaminated material.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe number of papers submitted to the Congress perhaps allows for further reflection upon how engineering geology \nand engineering geologists are adapting to an evolving series of challenges. In many respects the papers presented \nreflect the themes discussed a decade ago by McCall (1998). The primary hazards include earthquakes, volcanoes, \nslope instability and subsidence; problems are still exacerbated by rapid development, water abstraction, undermining \nor neglect. A further similarity is that pervasive hazards such as shrink-swell are not highlighted \u2013 perhaps a reflection \nof the type of research required to investigate these hazards, or the perceived relevance of such research to \nconferences. New development continues to be located in open-space, on slopes or flat lying alluvium, where hazards \nare greatest (Schuster & Highland 2007). Construction often encroaches upon marginal areas, for instance: coastal \nplains (Fall et al. 2006), unstable slopes (Zogning et al. 2007; Castro Junior et al. 2009), collapsible ground (De \nOliveira et al. 2009) or karstic ground (Hu et al. 2001). Most problems still seem to arise when rapid expansion of \nurban areas outstrips the resources available to the planning and enforcement system (Marchiori-Faria et al. 2009, \nBarrett et al. 1991), developments exceed their design capacity (De Oliveira et al. 2009) or otherwise fail to account \nfor their natural environment (see section on Urbanization). A significant challenge is posed by the planned expansion \nof towns into the future, where the growth is driven by political or socio-economic factors that outweigh any \ngeoscientific arguments that can be made (for instance Huang et al. 2009, Wu et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2009).  \n \nSo what progress has taken place in the past decade? Alongside the utilization of GIS, 3D modelling software and the \ninternet (Chacon et al. 2006; Culshaw 2005; Culshaw et al. 2006; Osipov et al. 2009), the greatest developments in \nengineering geology over recent years are the increasing adoption of risk methodologies. The past decade has seen a \nlarge body of work that provides an excellent framework for risk analysis,  for instance Cruden & Fell (1997); Maund \n& Eddleston (1998); Aleotti & Chowdhury (1999); Dai et al. (2002); Lee & Jones (2004); Bird et al. (2006). A wide \nvariety of approaches to risk analyses was demonstrated by submitted papers. These often required the combination of \ngeotechnical data and asset data with, for instance, microzonation studies (Maksud Kamal & Midorikawa 2009), \ndamage registers (De Oliveira et al. 2009), disaster scenarios (Williams et al. 2009) and, to a large extent, the \nprofessional judgement of experienced scientists or engineers (Fenton 2009). Much progress is based upon the \navailability of exemplars of good practice. These may take the form of simple case studies, but may also include \ncomparative studies (for instance Kwong et al. 2004) or the open publication of best practice documents such as the \nwidely referenced Australian advice on landslide risk analysis (National Disaster Funding Programme 2007). An issue \nraised by several authors, including Ferreira & Pejon, (2009) was the need to make data available to others in an \naccessible and useable format, though this often encounters problems of cost and copyright (Richards & Brynard \n2009). Sadly, a theme that mirrors some of the findings of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction \n(IDNDR) is that most progress is made in the aftermath of a disaster (Donnelly et al. 2009, Forster et al. 2009) or \nwhere the hazard is well understood (Ohta et al. 2009, Williams et al. 2009). Even then, geohazard mitigation is rarely \nhigh up the political or international agenda. For instance, the IDNDR was understandably overshadowed by famine in \nAfrica and the Balkan wars (Sudo et al. 2000). \n \nIt is useful to consider the papers submitted to conference in light of the hypothesis, put forward by Knill (2003) and \ndeveloped by Culshaw (2005), that engineering geology techniques are now well developed and the profession is now \nmoving towards a period of \u2018synthesis\u2019. To achieve this, engineering geologists have to make greater efforts to \ncommunicate the nature of their findings to support and inform the decisions of other professionals, such as bankers, \npoliticians and planners, many of whom have little interest in understanding even \u2018basic\u2019 concepts (Britton & Lindsay \n1995; Phien-wej et al. 2006). Crucially, this rarely involves communicating science. Instead, geohazard information \nmust be communicated in a palatable manner that is of immediate use and immediate importance to the end-user \n(Rosenbaum & Culshaw 2003). Otherwise the information will not be utilised and, crucially, the importance of the \ninformation will not be appreciated (Marker 2005).  \n \n 7 \nMora (2007, 2009) suggested that to achieve the greatest impact and help the greatest number of people, the role of \nengineering geology must now include pro-active movement of the profession's knowledge into the realm of politics, \neconomics and sociology. To a great extent this paradigm shift, of presenting geohazards research in terms of societal \nvulnerability rather than earth science, has largely been acheived within the volcanological community (Chester et al. \n2002). In reviewing papers for the Congress, it appears that for radon and earthquakes hazards this shift is well \nunderway. However, there is still significant progress to be made by engineering geologists to make the impact of \nlandslides, erosion, subsidence, karst and collapsible ground an important and serious political and socio-economic \nissue. \n \nAcknowledgements: This paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British Geological \nSurvey (NERC). \n \nREFERENCES \nAjalloeian, R., Ghazifard.
