The contest has been increasingly dressed with numerous stereotypes about \nthe nation, Europe and cultural difference. This paper looks at two different groups of \nESC audiences in the UK and analyses their engagement with the event and the \nstereotypes around it. The first audience group consists of participants in the BBC Online \nForum debates and the second group consists of committed Eurovision audience \nmembers participating in focus group discussions. Findings show that the stereotype \nbecomes a powerful, political, yet ambivalent, tool in making sense of cultural difference. \n \n \nKeywords: Eurovision, stereotype, cosmopolitanism, national identity, European \ndiversity \n 2\nMost people who have ever sat through the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) or who have \nheard of it will be somehow familiar with the contest\u2019s stereotypes: Cyprus votes for \nGreece and vice versa, Scandinavians are loyal to their neighbours and no western \nEuropean country will ever win again, as eastern European countries only vote for each \nother. While stereotypes have been around for as long as the contest itself, in recent years \nthey have been growing in firmness and intensity. They have been growing in parallel to \nthe numbers of participants (that now include more than 40 countries), audiences \n(estimated up to 300 million worldwide), and platforms where the event is consumed \n(especially on live satellite television and on hundreds of dedicated websites). The shape \nof ESC stereotypes, as well as the qualities of audiences\u2019 engagement with the event, \nreflect some of the key dimensions of an emergent cultural space which, though \nephemeral \u2013 or maybe because of its ephemerality \u2013 is revealing about the processes of \nimagining Europe, the nation and otherness in a popular culture context. The paper \ndiscusses these imaginings, as recorded and analysed in British audiences\u2019 engagement \nwith the ESC in focus group discussions and debates on the vibrant BBC News online \nforum.  \nThe study shows that musical performance and voting behaviours during the \ncontest are used by audiences as platforms for constructing, or for reinforcing, \nstereotypes that continue their life long after the event is over. Stereotypes originating in \nthe consumption of this particular \u2013 and rather peculiar \u2013 event are often unreflectively \napplied to wider interpretations of cultural and political difference. At the same time, \nfindings show that stereotypes are appropriated in two rather different ways. For many \nmembers of the audience, stereotypes boost dominant ideologies of nation-centric \n 3\nhierarchies in Europe and become versatile tools for the construction of everyday \nracism1. For a smaller number of people, especially for those regularly engaging with the \nevent, stereotypes become navigating tools in their attempt to make sense of distant and \notherwise inapproachable difference. As a result, watching and talking about the contest \nbecome activities where discourses of competing and, for some, incompatible, \nnationhoods, popular culture and Europeanism emerge in intensity not often observed in \nother domains of political debate.  \nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an interesting case study as it is a rare kind of \nmedia event in the context of late western (global) modernity, primarily because it so \nclosely ties together popular music and transnationally reaffirmed nationalisms. The \ncontest came to life as a top-down institutional initiative, aiming to bring together what is \nseen as national musical cultures of Europe into a common platform of celebrating \ncultural commonalities (or, to put it differently, of celebrating nationally defined non-\nthreatening differences). ESC is promoted as the ultimate European event that plays a key \nrole in the construction of a European popular (public) sphere \u2013 through cultural \nexchange and sharing2. Importantly, this European popular (public) sphere is clearly \ndefined by its initiators as a sphere consisting of nation-states, while cultures are defined \non the basis of state boundaries. Very few western popular music events are presently \nbased on such direct alliance between culture, nation and imagining of a (trans-)national \npolitical\/geographical entity, such as Europe. While a lot has been written about popular \n                                                 \n1 A definition of everyday racism is provided later in this article. Nationalism and everyday racism are not \nsynonyms but in some popular culture domains, like the ESC consumption, the two ideologies often seem \nto come together.  \n2 The European Song Contest was established in 1956 by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as a \npolitical and cultural initiative aiming at enhancing the European cultural space and establishing European \ntransnational media production. At the time of its introduction, the event was a major technological \nexperiment, as it aimed to produce a live and parallel broadcasting event watched across many countries \n(www.eurovision.tv).   \n 4\nmusic and the construction of national, ethnic and diasporic identities (Gilroy, 1993; \nGillespie, 1995; Rose, [1994] 2006; Simonett, [2001] 2006), ESC is a unique case, for it \nso intensely brings together nation-centrism, transnational politics and the construction of \nidentity and otherness. \n \nThe Ambivalence of the Stereotype \nThis paper focuses on British audiences\u2019 appreciation, rejection and troubled engagement \nwith an annual European media event. It analyses audiences\u2019 approaches to it by looking \nat two locations of public debate: the first part of the paper discusses Eurovision related \ndebates on the vibrant BBC online forum and the second part provides an analysis of \nfocus group discussions with Eurovision enthusiasts (i.e. members of the audiences \nregularly engaging with the event). Audiences in Britain have developed a peculiar \nrelation with the Eurovision Song Contest in time. Britain, which frequently won the \ncontest until the end of the 1980s, has gradually lost its leading role, especially as a result \nof the increase in participants\u2019 numbers. The change of the national position in the event \nthrough time largely frames audiences\u2019 evaluation of it at present. As such, the cultural \nand political particular location of the audiences studied here is important. Additionally, \nand as will be discussed later in this paper, in Britain, there is tension and controversy \naround the discussion of most issues European. Taking that Britain has not been doing \nwell in this European Song Contest for years, the debate around the value and relevance \nof it for British audiences has also intensified. The unease about the British contestants\u2019 \nperformances, the (lack of) appreciation by European audiences, and the politics that take \n 5\nplace around regionally defined and, the so-called, tactical voting, are themes discussed \nrepeatedly by audiences.  \n Stereotypes about the contest, peoples, countries and regions become frameworks \nfor interpreting the results and convenient tools for communicating arguments in the very \nlittle time and space available. Stereotypes often serve as entry points that ease \nparticipation and allow condensed, punchy and brief contributions to the debate. Though \nmuch of the debates and arguments discussed here have a distinct British flavour (as \nculturally and politically located), the tactics of engaging with such a cultural, yet \npolitically coloured event, reveal themes with wider relevance for understanding the \nrelation between popular culture, the nation, Otherness and Europe. In the analysis of the \nmaterial on study, the stereotype becomes both an operational tool and a central category \nof analysis, as it is a persistent method used by audiences in trying to make sense of the \ncontest.  \nThe Eurovision Song Contest has gained its popularity because of its availablity \nto millions of people on live television and because its dominant musical themes \nreproduce familiar western\/global and commercial pop music recipes. Domination of \nsuch themes makes ESC a successful transnational event. At the same time, ESC\u2019s \ntransnationalism is conditional and filtered through the nation. The top-down imaginings \nof Europe, which are controlled by a European institution (EBU) and the media, are clear: \nEurope is constructed by clearly defined nation-states that compose the European cultural \nsphere. In ESC, each contesting singer\/group represents a specific country, while viewing \nand voting are nationally framed with dedicated national phone lines ; votes go to a \ncountry, not to a contestant. The event takes place in the country that won the previous \n 6\nyear\u2019s contest, while it is usually mediated by popular local presenters for each country\u2019s \nnational audience. Also, as a rule, the ESC is broadcasted live on a national public \ntelevision channel. The fact that most contestants sing in their native language makes this \nevent even more of an affair of cultural exchange based on a bounded and formally \nrecognised nationhood. As such, this international event has more in common with \ninternational sporting events, such as the Olympics (as Christiansen and Christiansen \nargue in this volume), than with other forms of national and transnational musical events. \nAs Alabarces, Tomlinson and Young (2001) discuss in relation to sports media coverage, \nmedia can reproduce myths of national superiority and national identity. Similarly, such \nmyths are observed in the construction of this specific media event. A nationalist \nsuperiority projected, especially in the online debates, frames an image of Europe as a \ncomposition of competing and hierarchical national interests.  \nLike in the case of international sports events, the stereotype becomes an \nimportant category for interpreting the ESC (adopted by audiences and explored by \nresearchers). Yet the stereotypes\u2019 ambivalence requires a complex analysis that looks at \nthe mechanisms and the consequences of their appropriation. As Pickering (1995, 2001) \nargues, in media studies, the stereotype has been primarily analysed as a singularly \nnegative category of damaging misrepresentations of people\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 identities (1995). \nHowever, this is a limiting approach that assumes that \u2018real\u2019 identities exist against the \nmisrepresented ones. Such assumption reproduces another set of stereotypes about groups \nwho are seen as holding firm social positions. If instead, we turn to Lippman\u2019s analysis of \nthe stereotype ([1922]2007), we can make more sense of the relevance and consequences \nof Eurovision audiences\u2019 insistence to turn to them. Lippmann\u2019s ([1922]2007) influential \n 7\ndual analysis suggests that the stereotype has a dual function. On the one hand, it is used \nto justify irrational bias and resistance to social change, and on the other, it becomes a \nmethod of processing information, especially necessary in diverse societies where \nattitudes and cultures might be unfamiliar to many of its members.  \nAccording to Lippmann\u2019s analysis (2007), the stereotype is not singularly and a \npriori negative in its function and effect, but rather it needs to be evaluated in context \nand, particularly, in relation to control and power relations. Control of stereotypes can be \nused as a tool for sustaining power. Media play a key role in projecting certain \nstereotypes that reconfirm relations of power and social and political hierarchies. This \nanalysis becomes relevant in relation to the ESC, as audiences\u2019 engagement with the \nevent is largely filtered through (media) stereotypes. Yet, we can here observe the two \ndifferent appropriations of the stereotype recognised by Lippmann. On the one hand, \naudiences turn to stereotypes in an attempt to resist what they see as threatening \ndifference and when retreating towards a secure and taken for granted national and \nwestern imaginary. On the other hand, they turn to the stereotype in trying to make sense \nof unfamiliar diversity in an increasingly cosmopolitan Europe.  \nWhat the present study shows is that the stereotype of a hierarchical Europe, \nwhere British and western cultures and interests are perceived as naturally superior, \npredominate in public debates around the ESC. The predominance of the xenophobic, \nirrational bias against others indicates that it is not enough to tackle the stereotype, but \nrather we need to explore the kind of stereotype and its hegemonic or inferior position in \npublic debates and political ideologies. The findings show that the ESC primarily \nbecomes an occasion where xenophobic stereotypes are reinforced through banal \n 8\neveryday media consumption practices, which are then appropriated as banal forms of \neveryday racism. Xenophobic and degrading stereotypes about other nations and peoples \nin Europe predominate in audiences\u2019 opinions, unsurprisingly, next to similar stereotypes \nobserved in media representations of the event and of Europe (see Coleman\u2019s discussion \non the British televisual presentation of the event, also in this volume). Media function as \na key element of the apparatus that reproduces a hegemonic message of hierarchical \nwestern-centric and nation-centric Europe (and which also includes the nation-states and \nthe European institutions). This hegemonic ideology tends to be reproduced among \naudiences and especially through the reproduction of specific stereotypes.  \n The interesting diversion away from the dominant stereotype is observed among a \nminority of audience members. In this case, the stereotype becomes a playful mechanism \nfor interpreting distant difference. Like all stereotypes, these diverting stereotypes as well \ntend to be single-dimensional, biased and sometimes degrading interpretations of \ndifference, behaviours and attitudes. What is important about these minority cases is that \nthey show how stereotypes can support audiences\u2019 attempt to make sense of difference \nwhen information is not available in the public domain or when the predominant \nstereotype is extremely inflexible. Most of these cases are recorded among audiences \nwho have an expressed interest in the contest as a musical and cultural event and thus \nshow more resistance towards simplistic political stereotypes about Europe and European \nothers, compared to audiences who have no regular or emotional attachment to the \ncontest. In this case however, as well as in the case of the hegemonic reconfirmation of a \nnation-centric hierarchical Europe, we observe a tight connection of a musical media \nevent with a European ideological struggle.   \n 9\nNation-centric Europeanism  \nThough the Eurovision Song Contest has never been clearly defined as an event exclusive \nto a bounded Europe3, it has increasingly become an affair attached to the political and \ncultural imaginary of Europe, and more specifically, the EU. This is confirmed not only \nby the institutional ideology, which is not on the focus of the present article, but also by \naudiences\u2019 interpretation of the event. For example, the regular participation of Israel in \nthe (European) contest is discussed by many as one of those entertaining (or not so \nentertaining for some) particularities of the ESC. Even more importantly, many of the \nheated debates about the relevance and worthiness of the event on the BBC Forum evolve \naround the participation of eastern European countries, considered by some members of \nthe audience as being outside what Europe should be. In discussing international sports \nevents, O\u2019Donnell argues that powerful western countries \u2018can and must act out their \npreferred myths\u2019 ([1994]2004, p. 128). In similar manner, British audiences \u2013 especially \nas observed on the BBC Forum \u2013 largely construct their discourse of cultural and musical \nappreciation through the lens of power relations in the European context. As a participant \nin the online debates puts it:  \n \nAdmittedly, Eurovision is not serious, but this highlights why the UK needs to \nleave the EU now, because as it continues to expand [the EU], so will the Eastern \nEuropean influence. Yes, the UK, France, Germany do have more power, but \n                                                 \n3 Israel is regularly participating in the event. Also, Morocco participated in the event in 1980 and though it \nrefused to participate again as long as Israel is a participant, it still has the right to do so, as member of the \nEuropean Broadcasting Union.  \n \n 10\nsoon they are going to be outnumbered 3 or 4 by former communist countries\u2019 \n(BBC Forum posting, 12 May 2007).  \n \nMany of the members of the audience \u2013 as the one above \u2013 reveal in their words a \nwestern-centric discourse of internal hierarchies and interests.  \n \nGive the Eastern European countries back to Russia (BBC Forum posting, 11 \nMay 2007).  \n \nA discourse of an oppositional binary between the east and the west clearly \nemerges as a theme among a significant number of audience opinions. This discourse \ntends to reproduce an Orientalism of fundamental Otherness (and inferiority) of the east \n(Said, 1978) and reinforces ideologies of natural and essential difference between the east \nand the west. As Hall, following Derrida, argues: \u2018There is always a relation of power \nbetween the poles of a binary opposition\u2019 (1997, p. 235). The words of a Forum \nparticipant reflect this opposition, not only between cultures but also between political \npoles: \n \nThe whole lot stinks! The eastern block corrupts everything it is part of. I say we \nshould have a new competition with just EEC countries in it (BBC Forum posting, \n13 May 2007).  \n \n 11\nAccording to this discourse, the western nation \u2013 the UK in this case \u2013 is naturally \nallied to the other western European countries. Long-standing ideological themes of \nOrientalism and otherness in relation to popular culture emerge in many of the \nEurovision debates; their intensity increases further when they are used as interpretative \nframeworks in the crossroad of cultural everyday analysis and contemporary politics. For \nsome, the song contest becomes almost synonymous to European Union politics.  \n \nA horrid example of micro-engineered pre-arranged European claptrap. \u201cOh, isn\u2019t \nEurope cool\u201d \u2013 No it\u2019s not. Now, can I please have my country back? (BBC \nForum posting, 13 May 2007).  \n \nThis posting might lack the irony and humour that characterises much of the \ndebate around the contest, but it reflects a distinct attitude of political projections among \na section of the British audience. Thus, in a rather serious tone, another participant in the \nBBC Forum engages in a political reflection about the relation of Europe with the UK, as \nexpressed in the contest\u2019s results:  \n \nThe second from last finishing position of the British song is indicative of how \nBritain is regarded in Europe. Obviously the European Song Contest is a safe \nforum to voice this hostility towards Britain. But unlike Americans, us Brits are \naccustomed to everyone hating us. Just as well and pariah nation status beckons \n(BBC Forum positing, 13 May 2007).  \n \n 12\nThe intensity of emotional opinions those comments reveal, reflect the close \nassociation between popular culture and (inter-)national political affairs. On the one \nhand, for many members of the audience, the boundaries between politics and popular \nculture are very fluid, especially as \u2018serious\u2019 news about Europe tends to be very limited \n(EU gets little coverage in the press; cf. Gleissner and de Vreese, 2005); or it is often \nvery biased (e.g. observed in the Euroscepticism of a significant section of the British \nmedia; cf. Kevin, 2003; d\u2019Haenens, 2005). In this case, \u2018Europe\u2019 becomes a category \nassociated with specific qualities and stereotypes, often parallel to media representations \nof Europe\/the EU. As such stereotypes tend to predominate media coverage of Europe in \nthe UK (next to no or little coverage of European-related news), audiences seem to \nregularly retreat to them (Gleissner and de Vreese, 2005; Kevin, 2003). For some \nparticipants, the association of \u2018anything European\u2019 with stereotypes about a problematic \nand costly union with countries the UK does not share a lot with, becomes almost the \nonly way to engage with the single-dimensional category called \u2018Europe\u2019. On the other \nhand, the intensity of hostile and derogatory comments about Europe and other European \ncountries \u2013 a small fraction of which is reproduced here \u2013 reflects not only irony, but also \na sense of amorality in engaging with close or distant others.  \n \nThe extremity of many of these comments shows how popular culture is lived and \nimagined as a less restrictive domain for the expression of everyday racism, compared to \nother more political public spaces. Everyday racism is a relevant concept here, as it refers \nto everyday practices that become normalised and banal and thus considered by the \nmajority population as trivial, non-problematic or discriminatory. However, attitudes \n 13\nattached to everyday racism \u2013 often expressed lightly in verbal exchanges \u2013 can have \nserious consequences, especially for minorities, foreigners and others. According to \nanalyses of everyday racism, jokes, irony and public derogatory statements are not \nindividual acts, but social acts (Essed, 1991). Everyday racism can take different forms, \ncontradictory and specific to context. Yet, its consequences for the life of minorities and \nthe negative effects for intercultural dialogue can persist outside the specific events, \nespecially when racism becomes more complex and more difficult to pinpoint.  \n \nWhat is evident then is that racism is an ideology that is continually changing, \nbeing challenged, interrupted and reconstructed, and which often appears in \ncontradictory forms. As such, its reproduction in schools, and elsewhere can be \nexpected to be complex, multi-faceted and historically specific\u2026 specific forms \nof racism can be expected to change, and inherited racist discourse are likely to be \nreconstituted. New circumstances are likely to lead to new formulations of racism \n(Troyna, 1993, p.15, cited in Gopalkrishnan and Babacan, p. 2). \n \nExamples of attitudes that could be associated with everyday racism are observed \nin numerous exchanges on the BBC Forum:   \n \nI\u2019d like to know how much of my licence fee pays for this political rubbish. Get \nrid of it and let all the Baltics, Scandinavian and eastern block mates vote for \nthemselves! Have a UK-vision with all the countries, might have some decent \nsongs then! (BBC Forum posting, 13 May 2007).   \n 14\n Eurovision \u2013 and we are supposed to be happy to join this lot in a Common \nConstitution? For God\u2019s sake, let us get out of Europe before they vote us out of \nexistence (BBC Forum posting, 12 May 2007). \n \nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether we have the best\/worst song in the world, we get \nkyboshed by the French every time. They haven\u2019t forgiven us for not surrendering \nin 1940! The Eurovision Song Contest is nothing to do with music, it\u2019s all to do \nwith politics. At the moment the rest of Europe doesn\u2019t like us (whilst taking \nmillions of pounds from us in subsidies each year) so they won\u2019t vote for us \u2013 the \nwhole programme is a pathetic sham! (BBC Forum posting, 11 May 2007; signed \nas \u2018loyallittleenglander\u2019). \n \nThe political overtone of the debate is not only expressed in the dissatisfaction of \nnumerous participants with Europe and its politics, but also in the voices that reject this \nkind of hostile engagement with the contest and with Europe. In this alternative opinion \nfront, the boundaries between politics and culture again become indistinguishable.  \n \nEurovision has been political for as long as I can remember, and probably will \nalways be. Why are people suddenly yelling about an \u2018eastern Europe\u2019 block is \nquite beyond me, blocks of varying sizes have existed as long as the competition \nhas. Last year was the only exception I can remember when a truly unique and \n 15\ndecent song won it on its merits. British people just seem to be becoming \nxenophobic to eastern Europeans (BBC Forum posting, 13 May 2007).  \n \n\u2026I am shocked at the xenophobic and racist comments that have been posted! \nYou put us to shame (BBC Forum posting, 13 May 2007).  \n \nWhat is more often observed in this side of the debate is an ironic appropriation of \nthe stereotype as a tool for dismissing everyday racism.  \n \nSo I know why the European liberals are so bitter about America crushing the \nUSSR: it destabilizes the Eurovision voting process (BBC Forum posting, 13 May \n2007).   \n \nWoW! Does the above mean that I am welcome here as long as I do not criticize \nBritish ESC entries? (Danish participant; BBC Forum posting, 12 May 2007).   \n \nWhat can I say except I\u2019m very sorry that my country was broken into pieces and \nhow we have 5X12 votes on the Eurovision. I can only publicly offer my service \nin shattering the United Kingdom into Wales, Northern Ireland, Caledonia, \nScottish Isles, Yorkshire, Midlands, London and Cornwall, respectively. Just to \nmake Eurovision more \u2018fair\u2019 naturally (BBC Forum posting, 13 May 2007, \nSerbian participant).   \n \n 16\nIn evaluating these comments as examples of intense intercultural exchanges \namong people of different backgrounds, we can argue that oppositions reveal the \ncontradictory expectations in cosmopolitan communication, which is framed as both \nnational and transnational. In this cosmopolitan context, political anxieties often find \nexpression outside the formal political arena, and more particularly, in popular culture \ndomains. This is especially the case, as increasing numbers of citizens and members of \nthe audience get relatively more opportunities for intercultural exchange around popular \nculture than around political deliberation. These are also cases when popular culture \nstereotypes become powerful tools in boosting the power of nationalist ideologies. Often, \nirony and stereotyping reflect the two sides of the same phenomenon: the inability to \ncatch up with the cosmopolitan intensification of close encounters of difference. \nParticularly, in the ESC context, politicised anxieties also reflect the confusion caused \nwithin the institutional European ideology. Like many other initiatives by European \ninstitutions (Schlesinger, 2007), EBU\u2019s message about the contest is contradictory. On \nthe one hand, the contest is a celebration of a cosmopolitan world, where different \ncultural production comes together, and on the other hand, it is an affair of (inter-\n)national competition where cultures are nationally defined and framed. Audiences\u2019 \nexpressed frustration with the ESC reflects a difficulty in engaging with a culturally \ndiverse world, which is presented as both welcomed and as threatening within official \nideological schemes. European institutions\u2019 and European states\u2019 own contradictory \nideology celebrates diversity (but as long as it is bounded with the nation-state), while, at \nthe same time, it becomes uncomfortable when difference is more complex and outside \ninstitutionally control (Hall, 2002).  \n 17\nThe Contest Enthusiasts: Making Sense of Europe through Sterotypes \n \nThe focus group discussions with the Eurovision enthusiasts have had a rather different \ntone compared to the intense political overtone of the debates on the BBC Forum4. This \nwas an interesting finding in itself, as it revealed the different layers of engagement with \npopular culture among those committed to it. For the enthusiasts, the experience of this \nmedia event is multi-layered; their consumption, talk and evaluation of the contest \ninvolve different levels of appreciation and critique. Needless to day, enthusiasts\u2019 \nengagement with the ESC neither takes place outside the political and ironic evaluation \nof the event, nor does it exist outside the hegemonic framework of imaginings of the \nnation and of Europe as a hierarchical, western-centric and nation-centric transnational \nentity. However, for the committed viewers, both the politics and the aesthetics of the \nESC are never just about cultural clear-cut binaries, and even more so, they are never just \nreflections of geo-political divides. In the case of this more committed audience, we can \nobserve the negotiation of dominant meanings of the nation, Europe and otherness, as \nwell as the ambivalence of stereotypes that popular music consumption allows.  \nThe groups of Eurovision enthusiasts who participated in the three focus groups \nare university students in Britain and they all engage with the contest, including watching \nit live and following and contributing to public online or broadcasting debates before and \nafter its realisation. Though they would be defined as fans in the broader sense, none of \n                                                 \n4 Three focus groups were organized in Leeds in summers 2006 and 2007. The participants were British \nstudents between the ages 18-24. The focus groups, taking place in real time and consisting of face to face \ngroup encounters, form a rather different method compared to the online textual analysis of the BBC Forum \ndebates. It is possible that the methodological differences played a role in the production of different kinds \nof results (e.g. signs of everyday racism were not obvious in the focus group discussions, though very \nvisible on the online debates). Apart from any methodological bias, the difference of the sample seems to \nplay the main part in the different kinds of engagement with the event. The BBC Forum participants, in \ntheir vast majority, were not ESC fans and enthusiasts, while the participants in the focus groups were.  \n 18\nthem is fully committed to it as a cultural project beyond criticism. Only one of the \nparticipants has ever been to the contest; for the vast majority, ESC is a primarily \ntelevisual experience attached to particular rituals and expressions of sociality (e.g. \nEurovision parties). It is also far from being a serious affair, either culturally or \npolitically.  \n \nIt\u2019s not supposed to be a serious exercise of music (female, 22).  \n \nMy friends were disgusted when they found out I like Eurovision! (male, 23). \n \nI love music, music in general, but also pop music and cheesy music \nespecially. Eurovision is pretty much the cheesiest music around (female, 22). \n \nEurovision is a popular music media event and all focus group participants \nunderstand it as such. As Dayan and Katz (1992) argue, a media event is live and it is \npositioned outside the ordinary schedule and rhythms of television production and \nconsumption. For almost all participants in the study, the contest is a peculiarity not \ncharacterising their usual popular culture preferences. As a media event, it is unique and \nnot comparable to other popular music contests. Focus group participants place the ESC \nin a specific time frame \u2013 end of spring \u2013 and thus they associate it with specific \nexperiences that relate to the event itself (e.g. the Eurovision parties; getting together \nwith friends and family to watch the contest live) and also to their individual yearly \n 19\ncalendar (e.g. it fits as a break between exams or functions as a celebration of the end of \nthe academic year).  \nThe media event is attached to certain experiences of sociality that filter its \nmeanings and relevance. Eurovision parties are a big tradition in many European \ncountries, including the UK. The parties become a terrain where the distant becomes \nfamiliar, or appropriated as an exotic non-threatening other. One of the participants \nexplains:  \n \nMy family holds Eurovision parties every year, and last year, when I \ncouldn't make their \u2018Ukranian\u2019 themed party, I was on live video phone link to the \nparty, so I could still enjoy the experience!  It's a really fun thing to be involved \nin. We basically have stereotypical food of the host country and we produce our \nown marking sheets and system to give our own personal result. This makes the \nwhole process more fun because we have to judge entries on various criteria, \nwhich means we pay more attention to the songs! (female, 22). \n \nParties provide one kind of platform for consuming the event live and \ncommunally. Though enthusiasts tend to be, at least to some extent, cynical about the \nvoting process and the selection of the winner, they are aware of the importance of the \nlive coverage as a key element of meaningful engagement with the media event:  \n \nAs a general rule I watch the contest live, but in 2004 I was in France and my \nprior engagements prevented me from seeing it, but my parents recorded it for me \n 20\nfor my return. Whilst on my year abroad in Spain (2005), the contest took place \nwhen I was visiting a different city, so I made sure I was in a hotel with television \nin order to watch it (female, 24).  \n \nFor the focus group participants, like for the online debates\u2019 participants, the \ncontest is something uniquely European. Thus, in their interpretation, ESC\u2019s cultural \nvalue has nothing to do with any other music contest, especially none of the well known \nnational ones, such as the popular products of the likes of Pop Idol and Fame Academy. \nFor this audience, unlike for many BBC Forum participants who tend to interpret the \ntransnational Eurovision contest through comparisons with the national Pop Idol and \nFame Academy, this is irrelevant. When they dismiss any attempt for comparison \nbetween the Eurovision Song Contest and national music contests, they reveal two \ninteresting elements of an emergent cosmopolitan imagination. I would argue that the \nfirst element of this imagination signifies a sense of clear separation between the national \nand the transnational; these two spheres are understood as being distinctly different and \nnot competing, but co-existing with each other. The second element is about the \nadaptation of imaginings of Europe (possibly informed by the top-down institutional \nideology of Europeanism), which however, dismisses the ideological frame of \nantagonistic culturally divided European regions; this imagining is more interested in \nEurope as a meeting point rather than as a conflict point.  \n \nSome of the qualities of the event that grab the attention of this group, include the \ndiversity of contestants, languages, and the fact that Eurovision is a media event at the \n 21\nend of May \u2013 not an ongoing television programme incorporated in ordinary popular \nculture production and consumption patterns. Thus, their interest in the Eurovision Song \nContest is in itself a cosmopolitan exploration and not a reproduction of habitual popular \nmusical choices. In this cosmopolitan exploration, language diversity, which they all \nacknowledge as a rarity in the global popular culture production, becomes an attractive \nand unique element of interest and excitement. Some said that contestants who sing in \ntheir own language (instead of English) get their points and approval. Others enjoy the \ntongue and cheek lyrics and pronunciation variations. Some even admit enjoying what \nthey see as bad English used by various non-native English speaking contestants.   \n \nI'm also a language enthusiast and I love the mix of languages in the songs, and \nwhen they are sang in English, I love to hear the pronunciation variations. Then, \nthe unification of all the countries involved over a musical contest is something \nthat I think is very important for me.  I also particularly enjoy hearing the subject \nmatter of the songs, and watch them with subtitles so we can see the translation. \nFor example, the Austrian entrant of 2003\u2019s song about animals, and Germany's \nGuildo Horn's \u2018Guildo Hat euch liebe\u2019 in about 2000.  With Terry Wogan\u2019s \ncommenting, it\u2019s also generally a fun evening! I am also a massive fan of ABBA \nand seeing as Eurovision was what catapulted them to fame, it's something I like \nto watch (female, 24). \n \nThe fact that most countries now use English lyrics is both a bad thing and a good \nthing.  As a linguist, I dislike the dominance of English in anything, but \n 22\nparticularly in a contest which has people representing many countries and \ntherefore is a stage for their languages.  One of the highlights of Eurovision for \nme is the translation via subtitles of the songs. However, as a Eurovision fan I like \nthe fact that it\u2019s easier to sing along with the songs and understand them...it also \nmakes it easier for the results because you can judge on lyrical content more \neasily, but generally speaking I\u2019d prefer them to sing in their own languages \n(female, 22). \n \nAs Sandvoss (2005) writes about fandom, it can become a form of self-reflection \nin which fans seek out texts reflecting their own beliefs, attitudes and background. \nAssociating with the familiar and desired cultural product has been repeatedly recorded \namong the contest\u2019s enthusiasts. The cultural diversity hosted in ESC is another element \nof the contest that focus group participants enjoy. ESC is one of the very few mainstream \npop culture locations where countries of the periphery have a visible presence. A student \nof Slavonic languages says:  \n \nI liked the Bosnian entry singing in Serbo-Croat. It\u2019s much more interesting than \nPop Idol where everybody is exactly the same. In Eurovision you get a sense of \nall different European cultures. Where else would I see Bulgaria and Belarus on \nstage?! (female, 22) \n \nA sense that the contest is a rare kind of platform for celebrating European \ncosmopolitanism is confirmed by different people who feel that the ESC offers them a \n 23\nunique opportunity to develop their personal, educational and cultural connections with \nother parts of Europe. \n \nI think because my mother is Greek Cypriot I feel a connection to the Greek and \nCypriot entries and Eurovision is pretty much the only outlet for Greek music for \nus in the UK (female, 21).  \n \nWhile the focus group enthusiasts embrace the contest with much less resistance \nthan the BBC Forum casual consumers, stereotyping and political ideologies around \nEurope remain the predominant frameworks for making sense of it. Some focus group \nparticipants \u2013 but definitely a minority compared to the dominant group on the BBC \nForum \u2013 express their dissatisfaction with the so-called tactical, politicized voting. More \nor less serious comments about what they ironically call \u2018eastern European conspiracy\u2019 \nare familiar to all and they are adopted by some. Conspiracy theories go as far as to \nsuggest that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has to approve the results of the \nRussian vote before they are formally announced, as one participant argued.  \nWhat was observed in the case of the focus group discussions is not a rejection of \nthe stereotype and the conspiracy theories, but rather a more ironic and humorous \nengagement with them. There is a similarity between this tactic and the tactic of the \nonline forum participants who object to xenophobic and racist comments; in both cases of \nthose online participants and the focus group participants, we observe a playful rejection \nof banal racism. Thus, what most focus group participants said is that there are indeed \nvoting patterns that have nothing to do with the quality of the songs, but this is part of the \n 24\nuniqueness of the contest. In a more serious tone, some of the participants give articulated \nexplanations why tactical voting and neighbourly exchange of votes exist. They consider \nit as an expected outcome of cultural proximity and familiarity with regional musical \ncultures among voters in different European regions. Among the enthusiasts, the mixture \nof politics and culture can be entertaining and even an educational opportunity to engage \nwith Europe and international affairs.   \n \nIt is good to see new entrants. When Armenia joint last year, I knew nothing \nabout the country. So I googled it, and read about the country\u2019s history and \nculture. Now I can say that I know a few things about Armenia (male, 19).  \n \nDefinitely regional politics play a role. You only have to watch Cyprus send their \n12 points in the direction of Athens, and the UK's (pathetic attempt in all honesty, \nbut not worthy of nil points!) \u2018Cry Baby\u2019 received nothing for our participation in \nthe war against Iraq.  I think this makes it more fun, and adds to the element of it \nnot being too serious an occasion.  Terry Wogan always pre-empts which \nScandinavian countries would give their 12 points to each other, and now the \nsame happens in the eastern European countries. Until a couple of years ago, it \nwas always a sure bet that neither Cyprus nor Greece would give a point to \nTurkey and this would be reciprocated (female, 20). \n \nI think it\u2019s a good thing that the contest is open to more countries as it \nmeans that there is more competition and therefore, hopefully an increase in the \n 25\nquality of the material.  But I also think that there is more tactical \nvoting amongst the newer countries, mostly related to the former \nUSSR and former Yugoslavia (male, 22). \n \nIn the above comments and in the ones below, it is obvious that the stereotype is a \nkey mechanism for interpreting the event and its musical and political value. However, \nthe stereotype here is primarily a mechanism for making sense \u2013 not always lacking the \nbias and misrepresentation qualities of every stereotype \u2013 but still a mechanism less rigid \nand xenophobic than the examples of passionate rejection of the event in the online \nforum. The statements below illustrate the power of the stereotype, especially when much \nother information is absent, in the attempt of audience members to understand Europe \nand its relevance.  \n \nThere is something particularly \u2018European\u2019 about it. I think with the countries \nwho send their most stereotypical entrant to represent them, there is definitely an \nelement  of European-ness, but also for example, the fun involved, the ability to \nlaugh at themselves and genuine desire of every entrant to win (except, obviously, \nIreland), it is something I think is very European (female, 21).  \n \nI think because of the politics that is increasingly involved, it [the contest] is more \nrepresentative. There is also the aspect of the increase in participating countries \nand the increase in member states of Europe. The songs seem to be aiming more \nand more at uniting the countries and finding world peace, which I think is quite \n 26\nrepresentative of Europe currently as well. Also, the fact that Sweden almost \nalways (this year is an exception) sends out at least one blonde haired, blue eyed \nsinger helps keep the true European sentiment! (male, 23) \n \nAnd in an enthusiastic exchange among focus group members, the stereotype as a \ncommon language for engaging with Europe and popular culture, is revealed in all its \nglory.  \n \n- We always say Cyprus will send a dark guy in a white suit. Greece and Cyprus \nwill give each other 12 points. France always has a ballet.  \n- Malta always will have a large lady in a long dress!  \n- Germany will always resort in hot-pants, in the end!  \n- And Sweden will always do an Abba thing\u2026. \n \nTo Conclude\u2026 \nIs Eurovision the ultimate domain for the reproduction of cross-European stereotyping, of \nsingle-dimensional and biased representations of others in a transnational, yet nation-\ncentric context? The focus group participants very quickly dismiss the idea.  \n \nI think people can make the distinction. They know it\u2019s a big difference between \nreal life and Eurovision (male, 21).  \n \nThis is not the real world. This is Eurovision! (female, 25).  \n 27\n Like all audience experience, Eurovision viewing should be dealt with caution \nwhen it comes to any kind of effects on people\u2019s perceptions of the world \u2013 and of \nEurope and the nation in this case. However, the hegemonic ideologies of Europe as a  \npolitical entity constituted by hierarchical relations and nation-states of different ranking, \nare particularly powerful in media representations and largely reproduced among \naudiences. The top-down ideologies of the European institutions and of the state are \ndriving the dominant stereotypes recorded among audiences. These ideologies reveal the \ninternal uncomfortable contradiction in engaging with difference. The hierarchical and \ncompeting appreciation of difference has three consequences in the way audiences \nappropriate and imagine the contest\u2019s meanings, and to some extent, Europe as well. \nFirstly, the close association between culture and the nation is largely outdated and thus it \nleads to further misunderstandings about what cultural difference actually consists of. \nSecondly, the institutional ideology of framing cultural difference within the nation, \nreproduces oppositions between us and them, based on hegemonic, nationalist and \nOrientalist stereotypical characteristics. And thirdly, the stereotypical nation-centric \noppositions of culture confirmed by mediated representations of European popular \nculture reproduce hierarchies and reconfirm geo-political zones around single-\ndimensional characteristics of countries, cultures and regions and result in reproducing \nimaginings of a Europe of distinct zones and of conflicting otherness-es.  \nIn a context where a popular culture event primarily becomes a domain for the \nreproduction of political hierarchies and ideologies of incompatible cultural differences, \none can also observed the dynamic potential of the popular. While the aesthetic and \n 28\nmusical qualities of the Eurovision Song Contest can be critiqued and dismissed, as a \npopular culture event, it also leaves some space for constructing oppositional meanings of \nthe transnational and intercultural. Thus, what is observed, especially among committed \naudiences, is that it is less likely to unreflectively adopt the ideology of oppositional and \nantagonistic cultures. Audiences who regularly engage with media events like the ESC, \nwhich have a clear-cut structure and cultural and political role, are more reflexive of the \nvarious qualities and the particular cultures of Eurovision. Thus, they are reflexive to the \nnuances and deal with the event primarily as a song contest and much less so as a \npolitical arena \u2013 at least a serious one. People asked are quite sophisticated and playfully \naware of the national stereotypes around Eurovision. So, what can be seen is that the \nstereotypes do not necessarily reflect their opinions for other countries. \u2018This is just \nEurovision after all. You don\u2019t expect all French and all Germans to look like France\u2019s \nand Germany\u2019s contestants, do you?!\u2019 (female, 22). \nAmong dedicated audiences, national stereotyping is still present but playfully \nnegotiated. At the same time, what was observed is that, unlike the caution of committed \naudiences with reproducing rigid national stereotypes, stereotyping in other levels is \neasily adopted. The reflexivity around national stereotypes does not apply in the same \nway when it comes to regions. For most participants \u2013 in the focus groups as well as on \nthe online forum \u2013 Europe consists of distinct regions with specific cultural and political \ncharacteristics. This division of Europe builds on and reconfirms the predomination of a \npre-existing western cynicism and an exoticisation of the east, observed in British media \nand political discourses around Europe.  \n 29\nLack of reflexivity is also observed when other stereotypes, especially about \ngender, sexuality and ethnicity are easily reproduced. For example, perceptions about \nfemininity and sexuality in eastern Europe, or about ethnic and race relations in parts of \nEurope, draw from simplified stereotypes. The uncritical adoption of stereotypes in these \ndomains goes back to the limited information available about Europe and European life. \nAs audiences depend on very little information available in the public domain about life \nin various parts of Europe, what is available is more likely to reproduce \nmisunderstandings than cosmopolitan awareness of European diversity. As long as the \nmedia treat Europe as a zone of power relations, and less as a cultural sphere of \ncomplexity and diversity, the stereotype as a mechanism of making sense of it \u2013 either in \nthe form of reproduced everyday racism or in the form or limited and desperate attempts \nto make sense of difference \u2013 will remain dominant. Events like the European Song \nContest will equally remain an interesting case study for exploring political and cultural \nideologies in Europe, but less so it will be a domain for exploring popular musical \ncultures outside hegemonic and highly ideological political frameworks.  \n \nReferences \nAlabarces, P., A.
