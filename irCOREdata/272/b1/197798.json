There is, however,\nlimited research on how the all-encompassing concept of \u2018conspicuous consumption\u2019 has\nevolved since the introduction of the term by Thorstein Veblen in The Theory of the Leisure\nClass (1899). Using a chronological periodization this paper seeks firstly to examine and\ndiscuss the impact of wider institutional and socio-economic forces on the evolution of\nconspicuous consumption phenomena. Secondly, and adopting a historical framework related\nto economic and marketing, we show how the concept of \u2018conspicuous consumption\u2019 has\nbeen reinvented with different terminology during the twentieth century by marketing and\nconsumer behaviour theorists.\n2Introduction\nThe adoption of practices such as ostentatious display of goods and status\nconsumption maintain a leading role in social relationships, with material or immaterial\nconspicuousness being conveyed via individual actions and behaviour. Conspicuous\nconsumption, public display of goods or a desire for uniqueness and social membership via\nthe possession of status symbols are diachronic and cross-cultural phenomena that define and\ncharacterize consumer behaviour (Solomon, 1992; Mason, 1998; Chaudhuri and Manjumar,\n2006). Leaving aside the universality and timelessness of status-motivated consumption and\nfocusing on Western developed societies, there seems little doubt that individuals\u2019 concern\nwith self-image, fashion, and brand associations, strengthen and multiply the dynamics of\nconsumer behaviour as a process which apart from satisfying basic needs also contributes to\nthe establishment of social relations and the structure of social organization.\nThe importance of interpersonal relations in defining consumer preferences and\nchoices was a concern for economists including Adam Smith (1776\/1999) who suggested\nthat, to some degree, consumption contributes to the maintenance or improvement of social\nstanding. Thorstein Veblen (1899) is generally regarded as one of the first theorists to shed\nlight on how the process of social comparison via the display of status symbols by members\nof the affluent and aristocratic leisure class operated. In his classic The Theory of the Leisure\nClass Veblen questioned the conventional neoclassical economic views of the time and\nproduced one of the early theories of status-driven consumption. Veblen argues that\nconsumer demand for services and goods derives from a need to establish social networks\nand a desire to emulate higher social classes and economic groups. He named this kind of\nuniversal and diachronic consumer behaviour \u2018conspicuous consumption\u2019, an endless\nprocedure that played a significant role in social mobility and economic development of the\nUnited States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.  Although the\nimportance of status-seeking consumption practices had been long recognised as one of the\nmost fundamental forms of consumption, a fuller examination of the phenomenon in\nmarketing and consumer behaviour literature becomes noticeable by its absence (Mason,\n1998). Here we argue that the lack of historical introspection regarding the intellectual\nantecedents of the discipline along with superficial examination of early accounts about the\ngeneration of consumer desires, has resulted in the marginalization of ideas that form the\ngrounds of the conceptual basis of contemporary marketing theory and consumer research.\n3By reviewing the work of the theorist who originated the term \u2018conspicuous consumption\u2019,\nthis paper seeks to examine and critically discuss the evolution of status-seeking consumption\nphenomena throughout the 20th century and to highlight how institutional, social and political\nfactors have contributed in the reinvention of the concept with different terminology.\nConspicuous consumption before Veblen\nBefore presenting a summary of Veblen\u2019s theory of the symbolic meaning of status symbols,\nwe begin with a very brief examination of discussions about ostentatious economic\nphenomena that occurred prior to Veblen\u2019s era. Flamboyant display has been evident since\nthe time of the Roman Empire. Cicero described Mark Antony as an emperor accompanied\nby wild animals, actresses and custom chariots which sought to exhibit his social status and\nrise in power. Anthropological studies (Yamey, 1964) on capital, saving and conspicuous\nconsumption practices of primitive societies suggests that display of wealth was deemed a\nwasteful action and the individual who was aiming to promote his material superiority was\ncondemned and often exorcised from the community. From a cross-cultural perspective, it\ncan be observed that the importance of conspicuous economic display to social stratification\nof the community or group was defined to a great extent by environmental\/political\nconditions and cultural norms. For example, in the traditional social caste system of India,\nprestige and social status were attributed primarily in terms of hereditary group membership\nand occupational categorization, with status consumption playing a minor role in the arena of\nsocial competition (Lannoy, 1971; Chaudhuri and Manjumar, 2006). Studies by Mauss\n(1923) and others examining \u2018gift exchange\u2019 (see Gregory 1982) also emphasise the\nconspicuous and visible use of material culture and goods to make stable categories of\nculture.  Obvious parallels can be also drawn, albeit in contrast, to the complex exchange and\ndestruction\/waste rituals described by Malinowski (1922).\nAs Weber (1930) suggested, in Western Europe of the 16th and 17th century the\neconomic principles of Mercantilists and Calvinist religious beliefs supported a view that\nsaving and investment should characterize the economic actions of individuals. Ostentatious\ndisplay of goods and status symbols was stigmatized as a time-consuming activity that did\nnot support development and well-being (Mason, 1998). The economic and social scenery\nrapidly changed with the advent of the Industrial Revolution that established a novel and\ndynamic commercial reality where rising fashions, interpersonal relations and product\n4symbolism stimulated individuals to immerse themselves in a more diverse range of\nconsumption practices. Rising incomes, geographical mobility and technological\ndevelopment brought new employment opportunities and the emergence of an ambitious\nmiddle class, whose members were willing to take part in conspicuous consumption activities\nand ostentatious behaviour. Previously these activities and the significance attributed to them\nhad remained principally the preserve of aristocratic elites (Page, 1992). Although Marx\n(1883\/1981) was not interested in producing a theory of consumer behaviour, he explicated\nhow relations of production define class consumption and people\u2019s needs according to their\nhierarchical role in the production system of early capitalism. Back in the middle of the 19th\ncentury, Rae (1834\/1964) offered one of earliest theories of consumer demand stating that\nconsumption is an active process of socialization and goods function as markers of social\nclass (Edgell and Tilman, 1991; Alcott, 2004). As economic surplus was steadily being\nconcentrated in the hands of relatively few individuals and families in the United States of\nAmerica of the 19th century status claims and a hierarchical organization of society began to\narise (Twain, 1968). The affluence and exhibition of wealth during this period prompted\nVeblen to conduct research into the consumption practices of the upper and middle classes\nduring the golden age of American conspicuous consumption (1860 \u2013 1914), where the\nfinancial rise of the industrial elites exhorted conspicuous economic excess and a status\nrevolution.\nThe Theory of the Leisure Class (TLC)\nFive years before the publication of the TLC, the first edition of Alfred Marshall\u2019s (1895)\nPrinciples of Economics was published in England. The book became the cornerstone of the\nneoclassical economic view for many decades. Marshall superficially acknowledged a social\nas well as a psychological dimension to consumption and the need for recognition and\nattribution of status as a major feature of determining the purchase of goods such as clothing.\nIn the main thrust of his book can be found the representation and description of a rational\nand mechanistic \u2018economic man\u2019 (consumer) whose status considerations play a secondary\nand negligible role. Veblen\u2019s perception of economic reality, and market reality in particular,\nwas quite different and probably more sophisticated. As Assistant Professor in Economics at\nthe University of Chicago, he developed a continuous interest in the developing nature of\nstatus consumption phenomena, socio-economic change and cultural norms. By including and\nsynthesizing these ideas into the Theory of the Leisure Class Veblen produced an incomplete\n5evolutionary account of the individual\u2019s status-seeking desires from primitive to modern\nindustrial societies (Patsiaouras and Fitchett, 2009).\nOne of Veblen\u2019s major concerns was to examine how technological development and\nthe rise of economic surplus exhorted the nonviolent members of archaic societies to evolve\ninto the warlike people who dominated barbaric life. The dynamics of antagonism and rivalry\nwere created within groups, through securing the basic means for survival and through the\ninheritance and learning of new habits related to ownership and display of commodities. War\nand hunting pervaded social life and members of the community also experienced the\nemergence of the institution of private property, a feature absent from the life of archaic\ncommunities. Together with the establishment and development of individual ownership\ngrew the incentive of emulation, since the diversification of employments and the\nexploitative activities of men motivated escalating comparison. Epithets such as \u2018honorable\u2019,\n\u2018respectable\u2019 and \u2018meritorious\u2019 were attributed to warriors and hunters who exhibited the\n\u2018qualities\u2019 of superior force, violence and aggression. The skilful use of arms was considered\na sign of honour, along with the possession and display of large numbers of women, slaves,\nhorses and booties in the form of status symbols.\nWith the arrival of the second sub-stage of barbarism, what Veblen described as \u2018later\nbarbarism\u2019, the recognition and attribution of status according to the aggressive behaviour of\nthe members of the community was replaced by the acquisition of goods. The \u2018struggle for\nsubsistence\u2019 was substituted by the \u2018struggle for wealth\u2019 and progressively, private wealth\nsubstituted the good repute assigned to bellicose and competitive activities. The acquisition\nof property and wealth conferred honour on the individual and replaced the display of heroic\nand violent achievements.\nFocusing his interest on a post-agrarian environment, which partially reflects an\neconomic and social context as outcome of the Industrial Revolution, Veblen argued that the\nproduction of surplus contributed to the emergence of the institution of private property and\nthe distinction between industrial and economic employments. Consequently, individuals\nundertake to satisfy their needs for self-respect, high esteem and social standing not only\nthrough the reputability of professions and work but also via the acquisition, accumulation\nand display of goods. Furthermore, an excess of wealth is more highly valued than a certain\nstandard of prosperity. Pre-empting the discussion of cultural capital by Pierre Bourdieu\n(1984), as the accumulated stock of knowledge related to intellectual traditions and products\n6of artistic value, Veblen pointed out how aesthetic taste relates to status position. The\nlearning and display of gentle and sophisticated manners indicated unproductive consumption\nof time and could be exercised as a mark of social distinction. As the first economist who\npaid attention to this tendency to consume for status Veblen generalized and simplified the\nanalysis of socially-complex consumption phenomena (Bronner, 1989) and limited his\ndescriptions primarily to ostentatious and visible consumption actions (Campbell, 1987).\nEven today Veblen\u2019s name has been inextricably associated with the term \u2018conspicuous\nconsumption\u2019; a kind of exceptional consumer behaviour. Observing the reception and\ndiscussion of Veblen\u2019s incomplete but imaginative ideas on conspicuous consumption by\neconomists of consumer demand and early theories of consumer behaviour sheds some light\non how the concept has been used and evolved until the Second World War.\nInstitutional economics, recession and the early reception of the theory of conspicuous\nconsumption (1899 \u2013 1945)\nFollowing Mason (1981), the escalation of conspicuous consumption, recorded in the\nperiod 1890-1910, was followed by public reaction against the phenomenon of the \u2018idle rich\u2019\nand high spending at the beginning of the 20th century. As Hunt (1996) observes, the rise of\nmanufacturing capitalism introduced competitive struggles between social and class interests\nthat eventually led to anti-luxury and sumptuary regulations. Progressive political\nprogrammes sought to encourage and stimulate more and better education and simultaneously\nto diminish competitive economic display. As expected, the surplus of wealth and desire to\ncompete for social status was reduced after the outbreak of the First World War.\nConsequently, a major shift occurred in public attitudes towards ostentation, excess and the\nconspicuous celebrations of the \u2018Gilded Age\u2019 (Galbraith, 1987).\nAlthough the TLC had a considerable impact on the intellectual circles of economists\nand sociologists at the time of its publication, Veblen was disappointed by the reception of\nthe book as a sociological treatise on the mannerisms of the aristocratic classes (Dorfman,\n1934). Veblen\u2019s view that a significant part of consumer behaviour is driven by competition\nand status-seeking considerations prompted neoclassical economists interested in\nconsumption to marginalize his observations (Dobriansky, 1957). This changed after the\nGreat Depression (1929 \u2013 1933) and its disastrous impact on the industrial wealth of America\nand the conspicuous expenditure patterns of the rich. Before and immediately after the\npublication of the TLC, the economist John Cummings (1868 \u2013 1936) had been the most\n7persistent and conservative critic of Veblen\u2019s views about the consumption of socially\nacceptable goods (Tilman, 1992). In a polemic review of the TLC, Cummings (1899: 432)\npointed out that \u201cin Dr Veblen\u2019s philosophy\u2026all our judgements are based on invidiousness\u201d\nand \u201cthe more universal and dominant the spirit of emulation is, the more essentially generic\nit is in its character.\u201d In 1931, two years after the death of Thorstein Veblen and the outbreak\nof the Great Depression, Cummings wrote about the TLC:\n\u201cIt was hard for me to accept him or his philosophy. It went against my grain. I was eager to\nfind it lop-sided and unreal\u2026.My review gives good evidence that I didn\u2019t at the time fairly\nappreciate the contribution Veblen was making to our economic and social philosophy. I have\noften wondered how I could have been so blind. In the years since, we have all seen the\naccumulating evidence of the widespread influence of Veblen\u2019s analysis of social and\neconomic behaviour, as set forth in his Theory of the Leisure Class\u2026\u201d (Dorfman, 1934: 507)\nNotwithstanding the TLC and Veblen\u2019s work on conspicuousness and social display\nreceiving wider attention after the recession, economists remained sceptical about the\ninfusion of social considerations within prevailing assumptions about the behaviour of\nconsumers. Apart from Wesley Mitchell, one of the founding fathers of institutional\neconomics, who claimed that a deep and penetrating understanding of market behaviour is\nrendered impossible without a social analysis of economic behaviour and consumption, some\nof the most prominent economic theorists (Wieser, 1914; Carver, 1918; Knight, 1925; Viner,\n1925) hesitated or resisted acknowledging the importance of socially-inspired consumption\nand the interpersonal effects on consumer demand (Tilman, 1992). During the 1920s and\n1940s, Veblen\u2019s name and reputation was affiliated with members of the institutional\neconomic movement, who were proposing a historical understanding of human institutions,\nmore focus and attention on problems of social (inter)action and critical examination of\nbusiness and financial institutions (Hodgson, 1988; Hodgson, 2006). Their arguments\nattracted the interest of some early theorists of consumer demand who paid attention to the\nnotion of conspicuous consumption.\nJones and Monieson (1990) convincingly argue that between 1890 and 1910 a\ngrowing body of American economists working on the field of consumer behaviour had been\nexposed to economic views which contrasted with the principles of neoclassical theory. Most\n8of these economists had been German-trained and followed the scientific principles of the\nHistorical School of Economics, a social scientific approach interested in: a) a pragmatic\napproach to economic phenomena, b) statistical analysis and observation of human behaviour\nand c) focus on a historical understanding of socio-economic events (Jones and Monieson,\n1990). This type of approach towards economics was more able to accommodate the\nVeblenian observations of conspicuous consumption compared to the rational views and\ncalculus principles of neoclassical economics. Despite the fact that the German Historical\nSchool failed to offer a compelling substitute to neoclassical views or to propose a detailed\ntheory of consumer action, its existence gave fresh impetus to the amalgamation of\ninstitutional economic thinking and early marketing theories (Jones and Monienson, 1990;\nMason, 1995). Partially influenced by the work of Veblen, and especially his observations in\nthe TLC, institutional economists embraced the idea that \u2018group behaviour\u2019 should be an\nessential theme of economic study since human economic behaviour is in a state of constant\nflux and individuals\u2019 motives are mostly instinctive (Webb and Shawver, 1989; Schmid,\n2004). Contrary to classical economic theory, the institutional approach emphasized\nconsumption instead of production, favoured \u2018societism\u2019 instead of individualism and\ndefended the existence and distribution of public wealth contrary to private riches held by\nentrepreneurs (Dorfman, 1963; Ebner, 2008). As Bartels (1951:3) argues, progressive\neconomic ideas had been the main stimulus of early marketing thought and institutional\neconomists like John Rogers Commons (1862 \u2013 1945) had a significant role to play in the\ndevelopment of these ideas. As Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin, the\noriginal centre for the development of marketing thought (Bartels, 1962:34), Commons\ntaught and tutored some early thinkers of marketing like Paul D. Converse. In his\ngroundbreaking publication Institutional Economics \u2013 Its Place in Political Economy,\nCommons (1934) suggested that any phenomenon observed in the marketplace which\npossesses a \u2018dynamic\u2019 instead of \u2018static\u2019 nature should come under the close scrutiny of\ninstitutional economics and defined an institution as \u201ccollective action in control of individual\naction\u201d (Commons, 1934: 69). Commons and his former teacher Ely popularized a historical\napproach to economic science with emphasis to be laid on the general welfare of society and\nits contribution to answering economic (and marketing) problems (Jones and Monienson,\n1990).\nAs Webb and Shawver (1989) suggest, some indirect links can be traced between\nearly marketing theorists, such as Converse and Beckman - who approached the concepts of\n9dynamism within the marketplace, business cycles, patterns of consumer spending and the\ncausality behind the development of marketing phenomena - with the institutional ideas of\nCommons and Veblen. Nevertheless, the neoclassical interpretations of consumption\nphenomena prevailed over the development of economic and marketing thinking until the\noutbreak of the WWII (Goodwin, Ackerman and Kiron, 1996) and the inability of\ninstitutionalists to offer a methodical treatise of their theory together with an explanation (or\nremedy) for the Great Depression led to the decline of their intellectual movement (Hodgson,\n1988). Subsequently, Veblen\u2019s ideas regarding the social and interpersonal effects on\nconsumption preferences and practices remained vague and under-researched by the\neconomic theories of consumer demand.\nMotivational research and conspicuous consumption\nThe most dominant early school of marketing thought - the Functional School (Bartels, 1965)\n\u2013 did not pay particular attention to the notions of ostentatious economic display and status\nsymbolism. A small number of economists after 1925 began an exchange of ideas with other\ndisciplines (primarily psychology and sociology) so as to elevate the understanding of the\ncomplex consumer theory and many professionals interested in market research followed\n(Mason, 1995, 1998; Friedman, 2004). As result, trained psychologists and psychoanalysts\nexperimented via the application of psychological principles on consumers\u2019 impulses,\npreferences and motivations with very profound effects on the development of advertising. In\nthe 1930s Paul Lazarsfeld initiated the field of qualitative motivation studies aiming to\nunderstand some of the basic drives and motivations underpinning consumer behaviour\n(Tadajewski 2006). The inability of consumer demand theory to explain the psychological\nfactors and social incentives of buyer behaviour led to the emergence of psychoanalytic\nmethods, interviews, and participant observation for the prediction of consumption choices in\nparticular and prearranged circumstances. Although the interest in consumption phenomena\nand marketing research was continuously developing, the embryonic discipline of marketing\nwas still recognized as a derivative of (agricultural) economic thought and as a useful tool to\ninterpret the complexity of consumption theory (Mason, 1995).\nIt is only after 1935 that the intellectual gap between economists and marketing\ntheorists became noticeable. John Maynard Keynes (1936) seminal publication The General\nTheory of Employment, Interest and Money affected the way economists viewed and\ninterpreted consumer demand theory. Keynes attacked the idea that the end of consumer\n10\nbehaviour is utility and profit maximization, a view held by the majority of neoclassical\neconomists. Without elaborating on the formation of consumption preferences and desires, he\nargued that luxury consumption and ostentatious economic display had a positive impact on\ndemand, employment and money circulation. By acknowledging, in economic terms, the\nimportance of the propensity to consume for status, Keynes seemed to hold a sympathetic\nview of Veblen\u2019s ideas (Vinning, 1939; Mouhammed, 1999). However, the impact of\nKeynes\u2019 theory on the economics of consumer demand, and possibly early marketing theory,\nis far more complicated and lies outside the scope of this review. Leaving aside the impact of\nthe Great Depression on consumer behaviour, the following section aims to examine\nfollowers and critics of conspicuous consumption theory in the post-war period (1945-1975)\nof mass consumption, technological development and affluence in Western economies.\nPost-war period and mass consumption (1945 - 1975)\nA long period of economic depression beginning in the 1930\u2019s was followed by the\neconomic realities and consequences of the Second World War. Consumption of goods and\nservices was reduced to the minimum given that public policies, and subsequently advertising\ncampaigns, aimed to meet the needs of a war economy (Blum, 1976; Covert, 2003). Wartime\nrestrictions on spending and rationing on personal consumer preferences decreased and -\nespecially in England - substantially reduced demand for luxurious products (Deaton and\nMuellbauer, 1980). Across Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War goods which\nhad previously become accessible to a mass consumer public, including everyday\ncommodities such as butter and eggs, and consumer electronics and technologies, took on\nluxury signification. Landsman (2005) discusses some of the political and economic\nconsequences of these conditions in his analysis of post war Berlin, and the competition\nbetween Eastern and Western interests to compete in terms of the public availability of minor\n\u2018luxuries\u2019.\nIt is not until the middle of the twentieth century (1947 \u2013 1950) that consumption\npreferences began to boost the escalating rise of (post-industrial) capitalism in Western\ndeveloped societies (Bocock, 1993). Television advertisements produced increasing visibility\nof product images associated with social prestige and radically altered the communication of\nconspicuous consumption preferences (Galbraith, 1987). Social groups from middle-income\n11\nsocio-cultural backgrounds, embarked on the competitive game of conspicuous consumption;\nwhich seemed to become broader, far more sophisticated and complex, compared to the\nextroverted and ostentatious display of goods during the \u2018Gilded Age.\u2019 Industrial prosperity,\ntechnological advances and mass demand for products characterized the socio-economic\nscene of America, and high levels of job mobility in the rising service sector, together with\nincreased educational opportunities created a new middle class of white-collar workers\n(Riesman, 1953; Collins, 2000). This rapid economic development induced a significant\nincrease in consumption and socio-economic phenomena such as ownership of status\nconferring goods, socially-motivated consumer demand, and display of wealth.\nQuestions regarding the role and implications of consumption became more\nrelevant to the agenda of sociologists, marketing theorists and economists during the 1950s\nand turbulent 1960s (Mason, 1981). Ernest Dichter (1907 \u2013 1992) is acknowledged as one of\nthe founding fathers of motivational research, building on Freudian psychoanalysis to reveal\nconsumers\u2019 subconscious desires and feelings about commodities and services (Savitt, 1980;\nStern, 2004, Tadajewski, 2006). Establishing the Institute for Motivational Research in 1946\nDichter became a pioneer of advertising research, who not only adapted psychoanalytic\nmethods to study marketplace behaviour but also contributed to the introduction of the field\nof qualitative consumer research (Packard, 1959). Flirting with cultural anthropology, Dichter\n(cited in Tadajewski, 2006: 436) seems to be very close to Veblen\u2019s ideas by arguing that\n\u201cthe day-to-day behaviour of twentieth century man - even if he lives in Brooklyn, on the\noutskirts of Paris, or in South Italy - is as worthy of study as the Samoans or the\nTrobrianders.\u201d During the same period and drawing upon early theories of consumption,\nMcMurry (1944) summarized the main psychological findings on buyer behaviour to show\nhow feelings of inferiority - stemming from economic comparisons and social status\nconsiderations - have the potential to turn into decisive factors in the mimesis of purchasing\ndecisions.\nThis is the beginning of an interest among consumer behavior theorists to focus\nmore explicitly on issues of product symbolism, ostentation and consumption for social\nstatus. A renewed impetus came from advertising research and some pioneers of marketing\nresearch showing interest in the psychological underpinnings between status seeking\neconomic phenomena and symbols of status (Leavitt, 1954; Katz and Lazarsfeld, 1955).\nTrained in psychology and economics, Katona (1951, 1953) observed that the wealth and\n12\nmaterial comfort of the post-war years encouraged individuals to actively seek status and\nprestige through the display of commodities and leading status symbols. One year later,\nVeblen\u2019s name appeared on the title of an economic study - fifty-one years after the TLC -\nwhen Leibenstein (1950) published his well-known article \u201cBandwagon, Snob and Veblen\neffects in the Theory of Consumer Demand\u201d. Leibenstein intended to remind mainstream\neconomic theorists of Veblen\u2019s contribution to their discipline and coined the term \u2018Veblen\neffect\u2019:\n\u201cBy the Veblen effect we refer to the phenomenon of conspicuous consumption; to the extent\nto which the demand for a consumer\u2019s good is increased because it bears a higher rather than\na lower price.\u201d (Leibenstein, 1950: 189).\nAccording to Leibenstein, consumers\u2019 desire to emulate particular lifestyles or to look\nexclusive had remained out of the sphere of inquiry of theories of consumer demand and the\nanalysis of the interpersonal effects of consumption should be divided according to functional\nand non-functional demand. He also mentioned that one of the non-functional forms of\ndemand was \u2018irrational demand\u2019 and without detailing the nature or the psychological needs\nof the consumer himself, a central trait of Veblen\u2019s analysis, Leibenstein moved his\ndiscussion to the concepts of bandwagon and snob effects. He defined the term bandwagon\neffect as the economic phenomenon which causes increasing demand for a commodity due to\nthe fact that economically superior individuals consume the same product. The bandwagon\neffect helps consumers to \u2018get into the swing of things\u2019, to associate their image with superior\nlifestyles, or to be fashionable. In other words - to keep up with the Joneses. On the other\nhand, the snob effect refers to an individual\u2019s desire to differentiate himself from the\n\u2018common people\u2019, thus the purchase, exhibition and consumption of popular and widely\naccessible commodities is rejected. Overall, Leibenstein\u2019s short paper offered some novel\ninsights regarding the importance of external factors on consumer demand theory and\nsuggested that the price of commodities are shaped according to consumer\u2019s socio-\npsychological needs. By reducing Veblen\u2019s complex arguments to a one-sided theorem of\ndetermining specific prices, Leibenstein encouraged students interested in economics to\nmarginalize the anthropological insights of the TLC regarding the evolution of emulatory\nmotives, desires and consumers\u2019 continuous dissatisfaction, to mention but a few. A year\nbefore Leibenstein\u2019s publication another economist, Duesenberry (1949) recognized and\nunderlined the importance of social factors for the formation of consumption preferences. He\n13\nargued that luxurious commodities and high standards of living have emerged as means of\nsocial differentiation and superior status.\nInterdisciplinary approaches to conspicuous consumption\nGenerations of orthodox economics either marginalized or superficially examined\nVeblen\u2019s observations but as mentioned above, the phenomenon of mass consumption,\nfrenzied advertising activities and psychological findings on the motives of consumers\ncaptivated the interest of academics in other disciplines. The conventional sociological\nmainstream also had a limited appreciation for the ideas of the TLC (Mestrovic, 2003).\nVeblen\u2019s socio-cultural accounts of excess competition and status consumption were largely\nirrelevant to Parson\u2019s theories on the structures of social action; ideas which have been very\npopular and influential for the sociological agenda of their time (Tilman, 2007). An exception\ncan be found in the work of David Riesman (1961) who observed and responded to the rise of\nthe service-based and consumption-driven new economy. He presented a model of different\nAmerican social characters and identified and explored the main features of three cultural\narchetypes: the tradition-directed, inner-directed and other-directed individual. Riesman\nclaimed that other-directed individuals, a category wherein most Americans belonged, were\nin a constant search to behave according to norms established by peers and their consumer\nbehavior was primarily driven by their concern to conform to the societal standards or to\nproperly fit in social groups. We observe that Riesman\u2019s other-directed character builds upon\nVeblen\u2019s conspicuous consumer since they share many psychological and cultural traits, such\nas the same increased sensitivity to fashion, mimetic behaviour and conspicuous display of\nwealth.\nVeblen\u2019s writings, together with his reviews on Marxist thought, created a centre of\nattention for the scholars of the Frankfurt School. Their analysis and criticism of Veblen\u2019s\nideas vary and include scepticism of Veblen\u2019s technocratic views regarding the development\nof the American economy, technological determinism, false interpretation of America\u2019s class\nconflict and finally Veblen\u2019s misunderstanding of consumer culture and aesthetics, as a\ntheorist who conceived anything beautiful as wasteful and insufficient (Adorno, 1941;\nStabile, 1982). Building on the Marxist idea of \u2018commodity fetishism\u2019, Adorno aimed to\nexplain how the ceremonial\/conspicuous consumption practices connect with the\ntranscendence and emancipation from industrialized work life. Although there is limited\nanalysis on Veblen\u2019s anthropological and socio-historical framework of consumption\n14\npractices, Adorno criticized Veblen\u2019s almost melancholic and nostalgic admiration for the\nprimitive stage of human organization and incapability to propose future plans for social\nchange and development. However, in the following years, Marcuse\u2019s (1968) thorough\ncritique of the one-dimensional modern man in capitalist societies concurred with Veblen\u2019s\nsatirical comments on the American conspicuous consumer, who is continuously manipulated\nby fashions and participates in a national system of status and prestige (Simich and Tilman,\n1980). Fromm (1947) dived into the abyss of human nature and critically analyzed the\nincentives behind the everyday actions of \u2018the marketing man\u2019. Similar to the eccentricities of\nthe conspicuous consumer, the marketing man is obsessed with social status and his insatiable\ndesire for prestige translates everything into objects of transaction and consumption.\nTheorizing about the amalgamation of humanistic drives with cultural needs, Fromm\nsuggested a more authentic and autonomous stance for the consumer who is socially-driven\nby a having mode orientation instead of a being orientation, as a path leading to self-\nactualization (Shankar and Fitchett, 2002). Veblen and Fromm would probably concur on\nindividuals\u2019 inexorable appetite for the ownership and accumulation of goods, a state that\nenhances the idea of having instead of becoming an active entity.\nFrom a marketing perspective, Pierre Martineau (1958), the Research Director of the\nChicago Tribune and an influential promoter of motivational research, infused social\nscientific approaches into marketing practice and based on the social mobility\/stratifications\ntheories of Warner et al. (1949) explored how a variety of consumption practices aim to\nimprove consumer\u2019s social class position. Extending and building upon the notion of\nconspicuous consumption, Martineau\u2019s study (1958:130) crystallized the evidence of a social\nclass system that activates and instigates the pressure for social differentiation and suggested\nthat the middle class consumer is a \u2018mobile and risk taker individual\u2019 willing to spend money\n\u2018for various symbols of upward mobility, display and consumption.\u2019 Following an upward\ntrend in the sociology of consumption and Martineau\u2019s insights into social stratification and\nconsumer behaviour sociologists began to re-examine the extent to which social class\nbecomes an important determinant of consumer behaviour (Kahl, 1957; McCann, 1957;\nNewman, 1957; Coleman, 1961; Nam, 1963). Likewise, Bayton (1958) highlighted the role\nof products as a means of enhancing personality traits, a technique used by marketing and\nadvertising strategies. Acting as a forerunner of high and low involvement product theories,\n15\nhe argued that some consumer goods entail a higher degree of ego-involvement for the\ndecision-making activity whilst others have relatively low ego involvement.\nThe Status Seekers in the Affluent society\nThe work of Vance Packard and Kenneth Galbraith offered some of the most popular\ndiscussions on consumption in the post-war period and attacked the standardized economic\nassumptions of consumer demand by highlighting the nature of conspicuous economic\ndisplay during the period of mass consumerism. Initially trained as a journalist and writer\nand an \u2018insider\u2019 in the business and commercial side of the television industry, Packard\nobserved how the rising advertising medium entered almost every American household but\nwas simultaneously turning into the most powerful mechanism behind the motives of status-\nseeking consumers. With his bestselling book The Hidden Persuaders, Packard (1957)\ndemystified the then dark \u2018unknown\u2019 art of advertising to the general public. In a chapter of\nthe book entitled \u2018Selling Symbols to Upward Strivers\u2019, Packard (1957: 106) quoted Lloyd\nWarner as follows:\n\u201cWithin the status systems something else operates that is at the very centre of American life\nand is the most motivating force in the lives of many of us \u2013 namely what we call social\nmobility, the aspiration drive, the achievement drive, the movement of an individual and his\nfamily from one level to another, the translation of economic goods into socially approved\nsymbols, so that people achieve higher status.\u201d\nThe success of the Hidden Persuaders was followed by The Status Seekers (Packard, 1959), a\nVeblen-like study of social norms and wasteful consumption habits. It was a period in which\na growing body of intellectuals, academics and marketing researchers held and supported the\nview that increased consumption, job mobility and a new middle-income class had become\nthe mechanisms of building a truly \u2018open\u2019 and egalitarian political system. The uniqueness\nand affluence of the new social system were praised and eulogized by economists and\npolitical theories during the Cold War period (Horowitz, 1994). In opposition to those\naccounts, Packard argued that the escalating need for status striving strengthened social class\ndistinctions, destabilized personal prosperity\/happiness and served the interest of very few\nentrepreneurs. Packard\u2019s observations attacked the well-promoted idea of an affluent and\nclassless society and the book explicated how advertising techniques increased class barriers.\n16\nIn the same period and following Veblen, Galbraith argued that the phenomenon of\nstatus emulation lies at the very heart of power politics in modern American society. At the\nend of the 1950s, Galbraith\u2019s (1956\/1987) best-selling book The Affluent Society revived and\napplied Veblen\u2019s and Mitchell\u2019s institutional economics to a popular audience (Hood, 2005).\nGalbraith remarked that escalation in production and advertising strategies intensify,\npropagate and proliferate consumers\u2019 wants. However, these wants do not always stem from\nintrinsic and basic needs but from an individual\u2019s desire to increase his social standing and\nsatisfy hedonistic wants. Advertising campaigns produce and promote \u201ccraving for more\nelegant automobiles, more exotic food, more erotic clothing, more elaborate entertainment -\nindeed for the entire modern range of sensuous, edifying and lethal desires\u201d (Galbraith,\n1957\/1987: 115). We can note here that Galbraith\u2019s conspicuous consumers are less socially\ndirected compared to those depicted by Veblen, attributing the generation of conspicuous\nconsumption practices primarily to productive forces, advertising and manufacture\nrevolution. The continental social theory of Pierre Bourdieu and Jean Baudrillard, which\ndiscusses the meaning of objects and the impact of consumption practices on cultural\nreproduction, social stratification and individual\u2019s perception of identity and social standing,\nrepresents a further step in the evolution and application of Veblen. Bourdieu (1984)\nconducted an extensive large scale data collection, based on the existing social classes of\nFrance in the 1960s, and examined and pointed out how taste, cultural and economic capital\nhave been used by members of specific social classes to differentiate themselves from the\nrest. Describing cultural capital as an accumulated stock of knowledge, Bourdieu focused on\nthe process of how artistic and intellectual establishments reproduce inequality amongst\nsocial groups.\nChallenging and updating previous ideas on conspicuous consumption, which related\nmainly to products and services, Bourdieu claimed that the aesthetic aspects of preferences\nturn into the most eminent vehicles both for social upbringing and marginalization. Reversing\nVeblen\u2019s \u2018trickle down\u2019 model, Bourdieu concluded that the upper classes borrow\nconsumption habits and popular tastes from the working classes so as to confuse the\npretentiousness of the middle class and retain their dominant position. The contribution of\nBourdieu on consumption studies is comparable that of Veblen (Bocock, 1993). As Trigg\n(2001) argues, we can see Bourdieu\u2019s contribution as a complement to Veblen\u2019s theory and\neven recognize a potential development of the theory of conspicuous consumption.\nBaurdillard was also influenced by Veblen\u2019s thesis and refers to it directly in his early work\n17\non consumer society (1968 \u2013 1981). In The System of Objects, Baudrillard (1968\/1996)\nfollows Veblen by explaining how \u2018mental structures\u2019 and \u2018cultural systems\u2019 have arranged a\nsymbiotic but not always synergistic relationship where objects and their signified meanings\noperate in the definition and attribution of status for consumers.\nTowards consumerism and increased conspicuous consumption (1975-2000)\nThe era of widespread conspicuous consumption practices, beginning in America\nduring the middle of the 1950s continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s and business\norganizations produced a wide range of status based products and strategies so as to meet a\ngrowing consumer demand for social status, distinction and differentiation (Mason, 1998). In\nthe same period marketers and advertising agencies adapted their strategies and campaigns by\ndeveloping and promoting products which both satisfied consumers\u2019 intellectual taste and\npositioned them closer to aspirant social groups (Page, 1992). Additionally, we notice a\ntransformation from the socially conservative and highly materialistic 1950s to the growing\ncounterculture and political activism of the 1960s that caused the emergence of new reference\ngroups and a rearrangement of social stratification. The introduction of neo-liberal theories\n(Friedman, 1957) regarding the macro-economic function of \u2018open markets\u2019 popularized the\nnotion of consumer sovereignty as a factor of social competition amongst individuals for\nhigher social standing and status differentiation (Slater, 1997). Furthermore, status-motivated\nconsumption ceased to be viewed as a primarily American phenomenon. Following the post-\nwar period rising ostentatious economic display could be observed in many European\ncountries, mostly in Britain (Bocock, 1993). This trend has continued into the end of the 20th\nand early 21st century with attention to turning to conspicuous consumption in China, India\nand other \u2018emerging\u2019 economies.\nAcademic efforts to amalgamate the principles of social psychology with economic\nbehaviour revitalized the attention and interest in status consumption and product symbolism\n(Mason, 1998). Moreover, the legacy of motivation research theory and an upward trend in\nthe experimental analysis of human \u2018behaviour\u2019 (Wann, 1964; Watson, 1970) advanced the\nemergence of general and all-encompassing models of consumer behaviour. The introduction\nand popularization of the philosophy of behaviorism in the field of economic theory,\nmarketing and consumer behaviour during the mid 1960s and beyond led to rationalistic\ninterpretations of status-consumption phenomena according to the standardized\nmethodological principles of positivism. Sociological approaches on conspicuous\n18\nconsumption during the mid-1950s were replaced by the work of marketing theorists and\npsychologists who followed the movement of behaviorism and its application as a novel\nscientific economic approach towards consumption that favored the mechanistic theorization\nof the modern individual (Foxall, 1999). Terms such as \u2018stimuli\u2019, \u2018responses\u2019, \u2018rewards\u2019 and\n\u2018learning\u2019 gained prominence and permeated the vocabulary of consumer demand theorists.\nSuch enthusiasm for popular psychological theories resulted in the introduction and emphasis\non concepts such as risk taking, mental and information processes, and outputs relating to\ncognitive studies of behaviour.\nThe first detailed description of a consumer decision model came from Nicosia\n(1966) and a series of textbooks (Engel et al., 1968; Howard and Sheth, 1969) with the\nambition to offer a holistic explanation of the process of consumer behaviour following soon\nafter. These models suggested that the process of buying commodities can be identified,\nclassified and explored by four different levels of consumption activity; specifically a)\nconsumer attitude formation, b) information search and evaluation, c) purchase and d) post-\nconsumption feedback. Even today, a plethora of contemporary academic textbooks and\npapers in the field of consumer behaviour recycle, promote and re-think these popular terms,\nintroduced in the mid-1960s. Levy (1959) was possibly the first consumer behaviour theorist\nwho placed special emphasis on the symbolic meaning of brands as indicators of consumers\u2019\nsocial status. Building on Martineau\u2019s insights into social stratification and consumer\nbehaviour, Levy suggested that the interrelationships and interactions amongst members of\ndifferent social classes represent seminal factors for the (re)production and learning of\nconsumer behaviour:\n\u201cSymbols of social participation are amongst the most important factors in marketing. Like it\nor not, there are social class groupings formed by the way people live, the attitudes they have,\nand the acceptance and exclusiveness of their association. Most goods say something about\nthe social world of people who consume them. The things they buy are chosen partly to attest\nto their social position.\u201d (Levy, 1959: 122)\nLevy\u2019s groundbreaking publication proposed an alternative to the functionalist\nperspective of consumer behaviour science, by viewing the symbolic aspects of products as\npossessors of social meaning. Quite explicitly, Kotler (1965) had been the first marketing\n19\ntheorist who proposed a Veblenian Psychological model of consumer behaviour - along with\nthe Pavlonian and the Freudinian Psychoanalytic models - as a theoretical approach existing\noutside the marginal utility theory of demand. With the publication \u2018Broadening the Concept\nof Marketing\u2019, Kotler and Levy (1969) suggested the disentanglement of marketing ideas\nfrom a traditional business context and the application of the marketing concept to non-profit\norganizations, services, persons and ideas. The same year, and following a conference on\nconsumer behaviour theory, the Association of Consumer Research was formed and five\nyears later the same organization published the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR). The\nincreasing interest in the area gradually induced a schism from the discipline of marketing\n(Holbrook, 1987; Holbrook and O\u2019Shaughnessy, 1988) and by the end of the 1980s the fields\nof (primarily) psychology, economics, sociology and anthropology provided the most popular\nsources of study for consumer researchers (Leong, 1989).\nIn the 1990s, consumer research moved far beyond the simplistic concepts of buying\nand consuming and the influx of social scientific approaches has produced a complex mosaic\nthat includes the study of: judgments, deviant and compulsive behaviour, illicit consumption,\nconsumer learning, attention, involvement, innovation, cross-culture consumption, ethnic and\ngeographical differences to name but a few. Consumer researchers retained an interest in\nlong-established and diachronic concepts such as motivation, status groups, consumer\nperception and retention, emotion, hierarchical needs, vicarious consumption, mimetic\nconsumption, semiotics and status symbolism, hedonism, self-esteem and inferiority, status\nsymbols, group dynamics and socialization processes. Directly or indirectly, these concepts\nrelate to the interpretations behind the motives of conspicuous consumers.\nPost-affluent societies and status consumption\nThe archetype of the conspicuous consumer and the individualistic desire to\ndifferentiate via consumption did not disappear during the 1970s. On the contrary, new\neducational and entrepreneurial status and reference groups reinforced middle class\nconsumers\u2019 need to belong within a peer group or to a team of professionals who expressed\ntheir taste and occupational identity through distinguishable consumption lifestyles (Mason,\n1981). At this stage the term professionalism was increasingly used to indicate social status\nand association with the new power \u2018elites.\u2019 The recognition of a more market-oriented\n20\nsociety subsequently increased the significance of status-driven consumption and created a\ncentre of attention for behavioural and social scientists. Urbanization, fluid social\nrelationships, product diversification and the breaking down of traditional concepts such as\neducation, social class and occupation, stimulated the dynamics of competitiveness and\nemulation. The representation of such a universe of commodities and desires offered a\nchaotic picture of the marketplace. In the mid 1970s marketing segmentation strategies aimed\nto identify homogenous groups of consumers (Smith, 1956; Green, 1977; Wind, 1978), and\nconsequently similar groups of status-seeking consumers. The increasing availability of mass\ncredit facilities and discounts shaped consumer society and liberated individuals\u2019 desire to\nacquire additional status symbols with the promise of continuous future credit support\n(Ritzer, 2001).\n\u201cIn fact, increasingly important symbols in our society are the number of credit cards one has\nin one\u2019s wallet and the collective credit limit available on those cards. The modern status\nsymbol is thus debt rather than savings. In sum, credit cards emphasize a whole series of\nthings that can be quantified \u2013 number of cards, credit limits, amount of debt, number of\ngoods and services  that can be purchased, and so on.\u201d (Ritzer, 2001:83).\nInnovative segmentation techniques and highly organized applications of quantitative\nmarketing research questioned the utility of traditional sociological constructs such as social\nclass. A debate about the validity and legitimacy of social class or income for the prediction\nof consumer behavior occurred in the mid-1970s and lasted until the 1980s (Curtis, 1972;\nMyers and Mount, 1973; Schaninger, 1981; Dominquez and Page, 1981). This resulted in the\ndiminished importance of social class for marketing theorists (Coleman, 1983) and, by\nassociation, theories of conspicuous consumption. However, ostentatious economic display\nand conspicuous consumption intensified during the \u2018materialistic\u2019 decade of the 1980s.\nInterdisciplinary approaches were applied to the study of consumer behaviour, a fact that\ngave a fresh impetus to rethink an exceptional behaviour like conspicuous consumption. As\nPage (1992) argues, the aspirant middle-class managerial elites of the 1970s evolved into the\nstatus-seeking yuppies of the 1980s, representing individuals who enjoyed conspicuously\nconsuming a variety of luxury goods so as to position and establish themselves within an elite\nprofessional class. Belk (1986) details how the notion of conspicuous consumption was back\n21\nfor the masses and the yuppies\u2019 self-centeredness found relief in ostentatious economic\ndisplay, hedonism and heightened status-seeking materialism. Imitators from the working and\nmiddle classes found gratification in commodity culture and the reconstruction of their self\nvia status products. Psychologists and consumer researchers began to view the consumer as\nan entity and argued that the total of the individual\u2019s thoughts, perceptions and feelings, with\nreference to himself, define the \u2018self concept\u2019 (Schlenker, 1975; Rosenberg, 1979; Sirgy,\n1982), which can be employed as a flexible and extremely useful tool for further research and\nunderstanding of consumption processes. A proliferation of studies followed during the\n1980s, with the self-concept to be broken down and analyzed in depth through its various\ndimensions such as the actual self, ideal self (Landon, 1974; Sirgy, 1985; Graeff, 1996;\nGraeff, 1997), public self (Gould and Barak, 1988; Fransen et al., 2008), social self-image\n(Bogart, 1986; Sirgy et al., 1997; O\u2019Cass and Frost, 2002) and the over-discussed concept of\nthe extended self (Belk, 1984; Belk, 1988; Cohen, 1989; Tian and Belk, 2005). Inherent to\nthe notion of the \u2018self-concept\u2019 is the self-esteem motive referring to the tendency to engage\nwith (often conspicuous) consumption experiences that enhance the individual\u2019s self (Sirgy,\n1982). The increasing popularity of symbolic interactionist approaches, experiential\nconsumption and semiotics from the beginning of the 1980s inspired the study of product\nsymbolism, socialization theories of consumption and overall the interest in conspicuous\nconsumption as a means of performance and social positioning (Csikszentmihalyi and\nRochberg-Halton, 1981; Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982; Solomon, 1983; Appadurai, 1986;\nMcCracken, 1986; Mick, 1986; Belk, 1988).\nThe lavish spending and group competition for status in the 1980s was followed by\nharder economic times and, as an outcome of consumption excessiveness, consumer debt\ndoubled (Page, 1992). After decades of neo-liberal policies that promoted market solutions\nconsumption becomes increasingly defined as a space in which individuals express their\nsocial awareness about the community and the environment (Prothero and Fitchett, 2000).\nAltruistic tendencies, globalization and acculturation processes, asset-based and service-\ndriven New Economies, New Age spiritual practices and a progressive era of benevolence\nand activism synthesized some aspects of the socio-economic jigsaw puzzle in the 1990s\n(Trigilia, 2002) and to some extent these processes continue today. The ostentatious\nconsumption of the 1980s seemed to have reached its peak, although the explosion of\ncounterfeit status goods in developed and developing countries demonstrate a growing global\ntrend to consume for status, at least from an empirical perspective (Mason, 1998). We also\n22\nnote the thorough examination of how lifestyles and product symbolism shape the\nperceptions and preferences of \u2018postmodern\u2019 consumers (Featherstone, 1991; Hirschman and\nHolbrook, 1992) considerably diminished the significance of social class variables, like\nincome and education, for marketing and consumer research. Only few studies (Kapferer,\n1998; O\u2019 Cass and Frost, 2002; Belk, Ger and Askegaard, 2003; Amaldoss and Jain, 2005)\nhave focused on the extravagant spending and uniqueness via consumption and as Chaudhuri\nand Manjumar (2006) suggest, direct display of wealth and outrageous flamboyance are no\nlonger indicators of status, which is conveyed through in more subtle and sophisticated ways.\nMeanwhile, global consumer goods, in the form of brands, communicate collective cultural\nand status consumption identities to individuals interested in increasing their social standing\n(Holt, 2002). The popularity of prestige brands endorsed the predilection for consumption-\nfocused lifestyles and the price competition between luxury manufacturing industries\nrendered more accessible for middle classes the possession and display of commodities with\nconspicuous value (Vigneron and Johnson, 1999, Truong et al, 2008).\nConclusions\nBy embarking upon a close reading (or reminding) of Veblen\u2019s most famous work,\nthis study examined the evolution of conspicuous consumption phenomena throughout the\ntwentieth century. We observe that the initial reception of Veblen\u2019s book, as a critical\nobservation upon the mannerisms of the upper-classes, encouraged his contemporary\neconomists to marginalize the idea that the consumption preferences of the Rational\nEconomic Man could also be driven by impulsive forces such as emulation and social\ncomparison. The disastrous impact of the Great Depression on the income and financial\ncapability of consumers in the United States and Europe, encouraged a growing number of\nsocial scientists to pay some attention on ostentatious activities and wasteful expenditure of\ngoods and services. The economic recovery of the post-war period and the advent of the\nphenomenon of mass-consumption reshuffled social structures and revitalized the interest\ninto conspicuous consumption practices. In this context economists introduced the generic\nterms \u2018Veblen\u2019, \u2018snob\u2019 and \u2018bandwagon effect.\u2019 From the 1950s until the 1980s, we observe\nthat Veblen can be viewed as the intellectual ancestor in Galbraith\u2019s and Packard\u2019s critical\naccounts on consumer culture and Bourdieu\u2019s views on the aesthetic aspects of\nconspicuousness and consumption. Some of the first theorists of consumer behaviour -\nfascinated by the new market conditions of affluence - reappraised both product symbolism\n23\nand consumption for status. However the emerging models of consumer decision making,\nwidely used for pedagogical purposes, did not escape from the legacy of utilitarian economic\ntheories along with the behavioural principles of cognitive psychology and information\nprocessing models. General theories of rational consumer demand avoided acknowledging\nand discussing the irrationalities and absurdities in the behaviour of the conspicuous\nconsumer. Finally, works on conspicuous consumption were revived in the post-war period\nof mass-consumption and affluence mainly by public commentators of consumer culture.\nThese forms of extrovert display of wealth began to fall out fashion at the end of the\ntwentieth century with well-educated consumers prepared pay more attention to ethical\nconsumption and social differentiation achieved through taste and intellectual efforts.\nReferences\nAdorno, T.
