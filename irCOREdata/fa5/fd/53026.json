Generally, vitrified tiles are secured to a con-\ncrete substrate with tile grout or adhesive. To account for\ninherent dimensional inaccuracies, adjoining tiles are\npurposely separated by a void, which is then filled with\na commercially available grout. Since most grouts are\nepoxy based, they have several inherent problems. The\ncritical problem with epoxy-based grouts is their inability\nto restrict the movement of microparticles and micro-\norganisms; contaminants, germs and bacteria can enter\nand exit the grout into cavities behind the tiles to corrode\nthe adhesive between the tile and substrate [1]. Moreover,\nhygiene of the environment cannot be controlled. Con-\nsequently, epoxy-based grouts cannot be applied in\nplaces that demand strict compliance with cleanliness\nregulations, such as clean rooms and surgical operating\ntheatres. Also, epoxy-based grouts do not have a\nstrong resistance against wear. Under routine cleaning\nof the tiled surface with water and cleaning agents,\nthese epoxy-based grouts wear out very quickly. In addi-\ntion, cleaning of these grouts requires much effort and\ntime. Therefore, the useful life of the epoxy-based\ngrout is greatly reduced. Finally, epoxy-based grout\nseals become contaminated and damaged over time\nand, in turn, have to be removed physically and mechani-\ncally, which is arduous and costly.\n1227\nB15003 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nThe MS was received on 8 August 2003 and was accepted after revision\nfor publication on 25 June 2004.\n*Corresponding author: Manufacturing Engineering Division, School of\nMechanical and Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological Uni-\nversity, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798. E-mail: mjlawrence@\nntu.edu.sg\nThe inherent problems with commercial epoxy-based\ngrouts motivated Lawrence and co-workers [2\u20135] to\ndevelop the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing\nprocess. In this approach, a single pass of a high-power\ndiode laser beam (HPDL) creates a vitrified platform\nthat wets and bonds a layer of enamel frit to a substrate\nof crushed vitrified ceramic tiles and simultaneously seals\noff the surface with an enamel glaze. The mechanical,\nchemical and physical characteristics of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal have been shown to be superior\nto those of a conventional epoxy-based grout [6]. In\nparticular, the rupture strength of the enamel glaze on\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout was found to be similar\nto that of the vitrified glaze of a ceramic tile. Although\nthe single-stage grout seal has a strong vitreous enamel\nglaze, the concave surface attained upon firing is vulner-\nable to intensive compressive loads. At the initial\nloading, the enamel glaze is first to fail. As loading pro-\ngresses, stress build-ups in the vitrified tile substrate will\ncause the single-stage grout seal to collapse. It is there-\nfore relevant to study the effects of the curvature of the\nvitrified enamel layer on the stress distribution in a\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal and optimize the\ngeometry for compressive loads. Due to the dimensional\nsmallness of the seal, the depth-sensing indentation\ntechnique was employed to determine its mechanical\nproperties.\nPreviously, from an analysis of stress distribution\nZhang et al. [7] and Bull et al. [8] have shown that the\ngeometry of a weld bead plays an important role in deter-\nmining the mechanical properties of the weld. Teng et al.\n[9] demonstrated experimentally that the fatigue life in\nbutt-welded joints can be improved by modifying the\nweld geometry and residual stresses. In addition,\nKarkhin [10] explained that the efficiency and stress\ndistribution of the weld is related to its weld shape. By\nemploying the finite element (FE) method, Shuzalec\n[11] demonstrated that the mechanical performance\nand stress concentration in a weld joint can be improved\nand minimized through shape optimization. Moreover,\nthere is no significant loss of accuracy in simulating\nindentation testing with the FE method, as an analysis\nby Dong and Darvell [12] showed that the results yielded\nby an FE model were in reasonable agreement with\nactual indentation results.\nIn this work, an analysis of the stress distribution in a\nlaser-generated single-stage ceramic tile grout seal under\ncompressive indentation is to be carried out with the FE\napproach using the commercial simulation package,\nANSYS 6.0. The ultimate aim of this analysis is to\noptimize the geometry of the upper curved surface of\nthe single-stage ceramic tile grout seal in terms of failure\nloads, which will give an indication of the catastrophic\nfailure load and the overall load-bearing capacity.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n2.1 Sample preparation\nFor experimental purposes, standard 150mm\u0001\n150mm\u0001 5mm vitrified ceramic tiles were cut into\nsmaller pieces of 20mm\u0001 20mm\u0001 5mm and applied\nin pairs to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substrate\nusing standard epoxy tile grout. The width of the void\nwas 2mm. The fixed ceramic tiles were then allowed to\nset for a standard setting period of 24 h. Vitrified ceramic\ntiles were crushed, fine-ground by a pestle and mortar\nand sieved to ensure a particle size that was smaller\nthan 30 mm. To form a manageable paste the vitrified\nceramic powder was mixed with 50wt% water-diluted\nsodium silicate solution and was applied into the void\nto a height of 4mm and allowed to cure for 8 h. Simulta-\nneously, another manageable paste was formed by\nmixing enamel frits with 20wt% white spirit. A thin\nenamel frit paste layer with a thickness of 0.5mm was\noverlaid on the cured vitrified ceramic tile compound\nand allowed to cure for 1 h. Finally, the single-stage\ngrout-sealing process was completed by irradiating the\ncompound and sealing the substrate with enamel glaze\nwith a single pass of the HPDL. All the three test geome-\ntries had a basic depth of 4.5mm, as shown in Fig. 1.\nSpecific curvatures of the vitrified enamel layer were\nachieved by adjusting the distribution and quantity of\nthe enamel frits and by varying the laser processing\nparameters.\nFig. 1 Schematic cross-sectional view of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal samples\n1228 K C LIM, J LAWRENCE, L LI, R E EDWARDS AND A W GALE\nProc.

Engineering Manufacture B15003 # IMechE 2004\n2.2 Indentation testing procedure\nIndentation testing was carried out by the Instron\nUniversal Tester in accordance with an international\nstandard [13]. A compressive test rig equipped with a\nworking tool of a cone indentor with a contact face of\na nominal diameter of 1 mm was utilized. The test sam-\nples were placed on to the work-stage of the compressive\ntest rig. The position of the test sample was adjusted so\nthat the centre-line of the single-stage grout seal aligned\nwith the projected path of the indentor. During indenta-\ntion, the cross head along with the indentor travelled\ndownwards at a slow, constant velocity of 0.2mm\/min.\nDuring the travel, the applied force was ramped up to\na maximum load that caused the specimen to fail. A\ngauge-length extensometer measured the displacement\nof the indentor with increasing load at a sampling rate\nof 2 pts\/s. The experimental data were fed back into a\ncomputer program which computed and outputted the\ndisplacement\u2013load history.\n3 DEFINING THE CURVATURE OF THE\nVITRIFIED ENAMEL LAYER\nMost researches in two-dimensional shape optimization\nuse a mathematical function or a methodology to\ndefine and represent a curved boundary. Pedersen and\nLauren [14], Kristensen and Madsen [15] and Bhavikatti\nand Ramakrishnan [16] have all used the polynomial\nfunction, whereas Braibant and Fleury [17], Yang and\nChoi [18] and Sandgren and Wu [19] have each used a\nspline curve. Meanwhile, Hsu et al. [20] reasoned that\nthere has yet to be an explicit method to define and repre-\nsent a curved boundary by successfully conducting shape\noptimization on a torque arm with a curvature function\nusing the FE method.\nIn this work, the curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nis the only variable to define the differing concave and\nconvex surface topographies. With only two distant\npoints defined in space, the spline curve method to\ndefine the surface topography would require a great\ndeal of guesswork and is therefore inappropriate.\nAlthough the polynomial function can define a smooth\nboundary, it is not such an appealing approach as it\nwould require many tedious mathematical transforma-\ntions for the different magnitudes of curvature of the\nvitrified enamel layer. Consequently, a new approach\nwas adopted using the trigonometric shape function, N,\ngiven by\nN \u00bc sin\n\u0001\u0002\nX \u00feW=2\nW\n\u0003\np\n\u0004\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhich would ensure a smooth boundary for successful\ntwo-dimensional shape optimization and the mathemati-\ncal function, Y, with a built-in trigonometric identity,\ngiven by\nY \u00bc R sin\n\u0001\u0002\nX \u00feW=2\nW\n\u0003\np\n\u0004\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere X is the distance from the centre of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal,W is the width of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal and R is the curvature of the vitri-\nfied enamel layer. Surface topography of differing curva-\ntures of the vitrified enamel layer, regardless of whether\nthey be concave or convex, can be defined by adjustingR.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 2 that this shape function has\nN \u00bc sin\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc 0 at X \u00bcW=2 and, at X \u00bc 0, where\nN \u00bc sin\u00f0p=2\u00de \u00bc R, the maximum or minimum surface\ntopography displacement can be obtained by multiplying\nby a positive or negative curvature of the vitrified enamel\nlayer. A concave surface has a positive R, whereas a\nconvex surface has a negative R. The surface topography\nof the single-stage ceramic tile grout is thus modelled\nwith a series of key points that reasonably define the geo-\nmetry. To closely follow the surface topography, X was\nincremented from 0 to 1mm at intervals of 0.05mm.\nSeven geometries listed in Table 1 were investigated.\nThree of these geometries, 1, 4 and 5, were compared\nwith experimental values obtained from actual indenta-\ntion tests to allow correlation of the results with FE\nmodels.\n4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINITE ELEMENT\nMODEL\n4.1 Element selection\nThe SOLID95 element was used for the three-dimen-\nsional modelling of the single-stage ceramic tile grout\nFig. 2 Shape function for the surface topography\nTable 1 List of geometries investigated\nGeometry Curvature (mm)\n1 0\n2 \u00fe0.2\n3 \u00fe0.4\n4 \u00fe0.7\n5 \u00fe1.2\n6 \u00060.2\n7 \u00060.7\nFE ANALYSIS OF STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN A CERAMIC TILE GROUT SEAL 1229\nB15003 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nseal. This element comprises four configurations: brick,\npyramid, tetrahedral and prism. The 20-node brick\nelement is the basic configuration that handles regular-\nshaped blocks. Volumes of irregular shapes are handled\nby the other three configurations: tetrahedral (10 nodes),\npyramid (13 nodes) and prism (15 nodes). The SOLID95\nelement is versatile as it can tolerate irregular shapes and\ncould therefore model the curved boundaries of the\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal without much loss\nof accuracy. Each node has three degrees of freedom,\ntranslations in the nodal x, y, and z directions, which\nare sufficient to handle the deformation in the single-\nstage ceramic tile grout seal during indentation testing.\n4.2 Material properties\nAs the HPDL beam impinges with the surface of the\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal, vitrification takes\nplace in a downwards direction from the surface.\nAlthough the top layer is homogeneous due to sufficient\nmixing between the enamel frit and the crushed vitrified\nceramic tile, the bottom layer is non-homogeneous.\nTherefore, the gradual decrease in the vitrification level\nas the depth increases indicates that the microstructure\nof the lower layers is anisotropic and, consequently, its\nmechanical properties are spatially inconsistent. Since\nFisher-Crisps [21] has shown that the elastic modulus\nof functionally graded material derived from current\nconventional methods has a discrepancy with the\nactual value, using such a functionally graded elastic\nmodulus will most certainly extend the computational\ntime but will not necessarily improve accuracy.\nAlthough anisotropy introduces additional material\nproperties that render the basic field equation better\nstructured, more accurate and easier to solve, as sug-\ngested by Azhdari et al. [22], many simplified FE\nmodels assume isotropic conditions. A good example is\na recent study by Dong and Darvell [12], who repre-\nsented a ceramic\u2013cement substrate under indentation\nby an FE model with isotropy and obtained reasonable\nagreement in calculated and observed values of the con-\ntact radius. Since the composition of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal is similar to the ceramic\u2013cement\nsubstrate materials studied by Dong and Darvell, it is\nreasonable to simplify and assume the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal to be homogeneous, isotropic\nand having a constant elastic modulus. The assumed\nmechanical properties of the single-stage ceramic tile\ngrout seal are listed in Table 2. The elastic modulus\nand Poisson\u2019s ratio are close to that of glass since these\nparameters of the mix are determined primarily by the\nwater-glass after firing [23]. The compressive yield\nstrength is assumed to be close to that of a vitrified tile.\nThe failure analysis, an idealized Tresca criterion, is\nappropriate for the brittle single-stage ceramic tile\ngrout seal. Fisher-Cripps [21] found that a mica-contain-\ning glass\u2013ceramic material exhibits shear-driven yield in\nan indentation. Furthermore, it was seen that mica-\ncontaining glass\u2013ceramic materials exhibit yield in inden-\ntation tests with spherical indentors, even at modest\nloads. In addition, the indentation response of these\nglass\u2013ceramic materials was found to be a function of\nthe macroscopic uniaxial compressive yield stress when\nthe material was modelled, using the FE method, as an\nelastic\u2013plastic solid in conjunction with the Tresca\nshear-stress failure criterion. Other workers [24, 25]\nhave also idealized a brittle or nearly brittle material to\nbe an elastic, perfectly plastic characteristic, governed\nby a Tresca failure criterion.\n4.3 Load application\nThe loading of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal\nwith the indentor process is dynamic due to the time-\nvarying load. However, the indentor\u2019s slow descent\nmeans that the loading process can be treated as a\nquasi-equilibrium. As such, simulation can be achieved\nas a static mode by incrementing the load and simulta-\nneously manipulating the pressure distribution and con-\ntact interface. Simulation was subsequently carried out\nat six load levels: 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300N and failure\nload. As the curvature of the vitrified enamel layer of the\nindentor face is minor, the contact area was assumed to\nbe flat at each load level. Since many researchers [12, 24,\n25] have made the assumption that a rigid indentor will\nhave frictionless contact in FE simulations of indenta-\ntion testing, it was also assumed in this work that there\nwas no frictional interaction between the indentor and\nthe single-stage ceramic tile grout seal specimens.\nThrough work with an FEmodel to simulate indentation\ntesting, He and Veprek [26] pointed out that if the surface\nof the material was to be indentation-tested super-hard\nwith an elastic modulus greater than 550MPa, then the\ndeformation of the indentor cannot be ignored. Since\nneither the surface nor the bulk of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal is super-hard, the assumption of\na rigid indentor is probable.\n4.4 Application of constraints\nIt is assumed that the side and base of the surface of the\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal is tightly adhered to\nthe adjacent ceramic walls and grout respectively.\nDespite the indentation on to the single-stage ceramic\ntile grout seal, the nodes at these boundaries are\nTable 2 Mechanical properties for the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal\nElastic modulus 77.0GPa\nPoisson\u2019s ratio 0.189\nCompressive yield strength 100MPa\n1230 K C LIM, J LAWRENCE, L LI, R E EDWARDS AND A W GALE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B15003 # IMechE 2004\nconstrained in all directions. When the segment of the\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal that is under the\nindentor face is being compressed, adjacent segments of\nunindented single-stage ceramic tile grout seal are likely\nto pose resistance to movement in the y and z directions\nat the common plane. Since the modelling of an adjoin-\ning grout seal would require much computational time,\nthe model is simplified by assuming that the resistance\nin the z direction at the common plane is infinite. This\nis conceivable as the adjoining sections of the single-\nstage ceramic tile grout seal will be infinitely long in com-\nparison with the indented segment of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal and can therefore be considered\nas a formidable barrier. Another unknown resistance in\nthe y direction is considered to be negligible, as indenta-\ntion is likely to cause spreading of the single-stage cera-\nmic tile grout seal in close proximity to the indentor only.\n5 COMPARISON OF THE FINITE ELEMENT\nMODEL RESULTS AND EXPERIMENTAL\nLOAD-DISPLACEMENT RESULTS\nIt can be seen that Figs 4, 5 and 6 contrast the experimen-\ntal and FE-generated load\u2013displacement plots for geo-\nmetries 1, 4 and 5 respectively (as listed in Table 1).\nThe FE-generated load\u2013displacement lines are plotted\nfrom the equations obtained by means of a regression\nanalysis. Although the FE-generated model appears to\nbe stiffer with a steeper gradient and higher elastic\nmodulus, the results are in reasonable agreement with\nFig. 3 Schematic diagram of the experimental set-up for the\nindentation tests\nFig. 4 Comparison of the load\u2013displacement plot (geometry 1)\nFig. 5 Comparison of the load\u2013displacement plot (geometry 4)\nFE ANALYSIS OF STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN A CERAMIC TILE GROUT SEAL 1231\nB15003 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nthe actual experimental findings, with a percentage\ndeviation of 13\u201317 per cent. Three implications can be\ndrawn from this apparent agreement. Firstly, the\nassumption of the FE model to be a homogeneous and\nisotropic material with mechanical properties similar to\nglass is probable. Secondly, the constraints assumed\nand applied were appropriate. Finally, the dynamic\nloading can be successfully simulated by a static model\nthrough load increment with manipulation of the contact\narea and load distribution. In addition, all the plots sug-\ngest that the FE results are converging to the actual\nexperiment results, with the percentage deviation\ndecreasing as the load increases. One probable reason\nfor this is that, at higher loads, the vitrified enamel\nlayer on the surface of the single-stage ceramic tile\ngrout seal would have failed, meaning that the bulk of\nthe single-stage ceramic tile grout seal, which consists\nmainly of the crushed vitrified tile substrate, would be\nsupporting the load. Because the elastic modulus and\nPoisson\u2019s ratio of this substrate are assumed to be\nsimilar to that of the glass, a convergence of results will\noccur.\n6 OPTIMIZATION OF THE CURVATURE OF\nTHE VITRIFIED ENAMEL LAYER\n6.1 Optimization objective\nWhen indented, the single-stage grout seal experiences\ntwo phases of failure. The first phase of failure is the\nfunctionality failure occurring at initial loadings,\nwhereby cracks develop from the surface of the single-\nstage ceramic tile grout seal and propagate into the\nvitrified enamel layer. Although unsightly, such a failure\nis not disastrous as it could quite feasibly be repaired by\nmeans of HPDL treatment, always assuming that the\ndamage is not too severe. However, as loading is further\nincreased, a sufficient amount of yielding will take place,\ncausing the entire single-stage ceramic tile grout seal to\ncollapse under a catastrophic failure mode.\nIt was observed from the indentation experiments (see\nTable 3) that the load to failure increased as the curva-\nture of the vitrified enamel layer increased. However,\nincreasing curvature of the vitrified enamel layer will\nalso bring about a higher stress concentration at the con-\ntact surface, thereby causing the vitrified enamel glaze to\nfail at a lower load capacity. From the experiments it was\nnoted that the vitrified enamel glaze for the flat geometry\nfailed at approximately 150N. The load-bearing capacity\nof the enamel glaze for the two curvilinear geometries lies\nbelow 50N.\nThe optimum curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nmust also consider the warning factor, whereby the\nfailed enamel glaze would serve as an indication before\ncatastrophic failure and allow time for maintenance.\nThus, the objective of the curvature optimization must\nhave two concerns: (a) the curvature of the vitrified\nenamel layer should provide the enamel glaze and the\nbulk of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal with a rea-\nsonable load-bearing capacity and (b) simultaneously\nhave sufficient indication of a catastrophic failure.\n6.2 Optimization approach\nGeometries of seven different curvatures of the vitrified\nenamel layer (as listed in Table 1) were modelled and\nsimulated. Of the seven geometries tested, two surfaces\nwere convex (\u00060.2 and \u00060.7mm), one was flat (0mm)\nand the remaining were concave (\u00fe0.2, \u00fe0.4, \u00fe0.7 and\n\u00fe1.2mm). Since the indentation exhibits shear driven\nFig. 6 Comparison of the load\u2013displacement plot (geometry 5)\nTable 3 Experimental observations of the maximum Tresca\nstresses at the vitrified enamel layer during indenta-\ntion\nGeometry\nCurvature\n(mm)\nEnamel seal LBC\n(N)\nOverall LBC\n(N)\n1 0 150 316.6\n4 \u00fe0.7 <50 326.2\n5 \u00fe1.2 <50 329.4\n1232 K C LIM, J LAWRENCE, L LI, R E EDWARDS AND A W GALE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B15003 # IMechE 2004\nyield, the material was idealized to be an elastic, perfectly\nplastic characteristic where the catastrophic failure and\nfunctionality failure of the single-stage ceramic tile\ngrout seal would be related to the Tresca criterion,\nwhich states that failure occurs when the maximum\ndifference of the principal stresses exceeds the yield\nstrength. The yield strength is the compression yield\nstrength of the vitrified tiles, which was 100MPa. To\npredict the load-bearing capacity (LBC) of the vitrified\nenamel layer, the models were loaded at three load\nlevels: 100, 200 and 300N. The maximum Tresca stresses\nat the enamel glaze contact surface were correlated with\nexperimental observations. Finally, the criterion is\napplied to other untested geometries to predict their\nLBCs. The second phase of the analysis is to predict\nthe overall LBC of the single-stage ceramic tile grout\nseal. Firstly, the loads to cause catastrophic failure on\nthe three experimentally tested geometries were simu-\nlated with the FEmodel. Next, the Tresca stress contours\nwere analysed and correlated with the experimental\nfindings to implement a criterion to predict the overall\nLBC. Finally, the criterion is applied to untested geome-\ntries to predict the overall LBC.\n6.3 Observations from stress contours\nIf geometries 3 to 5 are considered, whose contact areas\nand load distribution do not differ much, it can be seen\nthat as the curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nincreases, the nominal stress decreases. This finding\nagrees with the theorem proved by Hsu [27], which\nstates that when the position of both end points of the\nboundary curve to be varied are fixed, increasing the\ndepth under the curve will ensure a decrease in stress.\nTable 4 shows that the Tresca stress contours at the\nthree load levels indicate that the flat geometry experi-\nences the least yielding on the contact surface. This is\nbecause the flat geometry has the maximum contact\narea with the indentor. As curvature of the vitrified\nenamel layer increases or decreases from a flat surface\ngeometry, the contact area reduces. Moreover, it is\nnoted that the reduction in contact area from the\ndecrease of curvature of the vitrified enamel layer is\nmore drastic and leads to a higher maximum Tresca\nstress, as can be seen from a comparison of geometry\n6 and geometries 2 to 5 in Table 4. Nevertheless, an\nagreement is seen in all the geometries that the maximum\nTresca is located at the region of contact.\n6.4 Criterion for the prediction of load-bearing\ncapacities\nFrom the Tresca stress contours at the three load levels\nof the experimentally tested geometries (1, 4 and 5), it\ncan be seen in Table 4 that the maximum Tresca stresses\nat the contact region have already exceeded the 100MPa\nyield strength of the vitrified enamel surface. This obser-\nvation is in agreement with the research of Fisher-Cripps\n[28], which demonstrated that materials exhibit yield in\nindentation tests with spherical indentors, even at\nmodest loads. It is clear that the enamel seal would fail\nonly if the maximum Tresca stress exceeds the yield\nstrength by a certain degree.\nThe ratio of maximum Tresca stress to yield strength is\nplotted against load in Fig. 7. Correlating with the\nexperimental observations from Table 3, it was com-\nputed that for the vitrified enamel layer to fail, the max-\nimum surface Tresca stress must be at least 3.5 times the\nyield strength. This criterion is applied to predict vitrified\nenamel layer LBCs for the untested geometries. From\nFig. 7, geometries 6 and 7 with negative curvatures of\nthe vitrified enamel layer will experience earliest failure\nof the enamel seal, at 10N. Geometries 2 to 5, which\nhave positive curvatures of the vitrified enamel layer,\nwill experience failure of the glaze layer between 60 and\n80N. The flat surface geometry, 1, has the highest\nenamel seal LBC, at 150N.\nFrom the Tresca stress distribution of the three experi-\nmentally tested single-stage ceramic tile grout seals at\ntheir failure loads given in Fig. 8, it can be seen that a\nsignificant portion of the cross-sectional area, approxi-\nmately 29 per cent, is in the yield state for all three geo-\nmetries. It is deduced that catastrophic failure occurs\nwhen 29 per cent of the single-stage ceramic tile grout\nseal is in the yield state. This criterion is applied to\npredict overall LBCs for untested geometries.\nFor geometries with negative curvatures of the vitrified\nenamel layer, the overhanging region experiences high\ntensile stresses during loading. As the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal is stronger in compression than\ntension, this overhanging region might collapse during\nthe early loading phase. Since the model does not take\nTable 4 Experimental results and observations in terms of load\nLoad (N)\nMaximum Tresca stress at vitrified enamel layer (MPa)\n1 (0) 2 (\u00fe0.2) 3 (\u00fe0.4) 4 (\u00fe0.7) 5 (\u00fe1.2) 6 (\u00060.2) 7 (\u00060.7)\n100 236 404 721 804 898 2510 2640\n200 440 804 1420 1650 1800 4590 5030\n300 668 1230 2110 2490 2690 6660 7810\nFE ANALYSIS OF STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN A CERAMIC TILE GROUT SEAL 1233\nB15003 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nthis into account, it is likely that the overall LBCs for\nnegative curvatures of the vitrified enamel layer are\nlower than the predicted values. From the overall\nLBCs versus the curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nin Fig. 9, it is seen that the overall LBC increases with\ncurvatures of the vitrified enamel layer. The reason is\nthat increased curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nwould generate a larger volume of single-stage ceramic\ntile grout seals, so that for 29 per cent of the area to\nreach the yield state would require higher loads. How-\never, this trend is not perpetual as the positive gradient\nis decreasing. The plot indicates that the peak might\nFig. 7 Plot of the stress ratio against load for various radii of curvature\nFig. 8 Stress contours at failure loads (units are N)\n1234 K C LIM, J LAWRENCE, L LI, R E EDWARDS AND A W GALE\nProc.

Engineering Manufacture B15003 # IMechE 2004\noccur somewhere near a curvature of the vitrified enamel\nlayer of 1.2mm.\n6.5 Optimum design\nEuropean standards [29] specify cementitious grout to\nhave a compressive strength of 45N\/mm2. In Fig. 10,\nthe two LBCs and their differences are plotted against\ncurvatures of the vitrified enamel layer. Generally, a\nlarge LBC difference gives an early indication that the\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal is damaged and\nrequires repair. As all the values are greater than 150N\n(three times higher than the standard specification of\nthe resin grout), it is concluded that all geometries\nwould give a sufficient reaction time. In addition, it is\nnoted that the overall LBCs for all the geometries are\nabove 300N, which is seven times higher than the stan-\ndard specification. The deciding factor lies in the vitrified\nenamel layer. For curvatures of the vitrified enamel layer\nFig. 9 Trend of the overall load-bearing capacity with different curvatures of the vitrified enamel layer\nFig. 10 Load-bearing capacities with curvature of the vitrified enamel layer\nFE ANALYSIS OF STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN A CERAMIC TILE GROUT SEAL 1235\nB15003 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nless than\u00060.2mm and larger than\u00fe0.4mm, a large LBC\ndifference would result in an overly weakened vitrified\nenamel layer that would require frequent repairs, since\nthe increased sensitivity is not accompanied by any\nsignificant improvement in the overall LBC. To satisfy\nthe standard European specification, a curvature of the\nvitrified enamel layer of \u00060.15 to \u00fe0.40mm would be\nsufficient. However, for a safety factor of two, the curva-\nture of the vitrified enamel layer ought to be within\u00060.08\nto \u00fe0.15mm. Subsequently, for a safety factor of three,\nthe curvature of the vitrified enamel layer should be kept\nbetween \u00060.02mm and \u00fe0.05mm. The optimum design\nis a flat surface geometry.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nFrom the reasonable agreement of 13\u201317 per cent of the\nload\u2013displacement results obtained with the finite\nelement (FE) model and the actual experimental results,\nit is concluded that the FE model is capable of simulating\nthe indentation testing. The constraints and loading were\nappropriately assumed and applied. Having said this, the\nidealization of the graded substrate to be a homogeneous\nand isotropic model with constant elastic modulus and\nPoisson\u2019s ratio similar to glass is the main cause of\nminor discrepancies and is the reason that the FE\nmodel appears to be stiffer with a steeper gradient and\nhigher elastic modulus. The work revealed that the\nstress distribution derived from the FE model, along\nwith the Tresca failure criterion, was capable of predict-\ning load bearing capacities (LBCs) of the single-stage\nceramic tile grout seal. The vitrified enamel surface\nlayer was found to fail when the maximum Tresca\nstress is 3.5 times the yield strength and the entire\nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal collapsed when 29\nper cent of its cross-section is above the yield state.\nFrom the investigation it was noticed that the slight\nimprovements in the overall LBC for increased curva-\ntures of the vitrified enamel layer were offset by a greater\ndegradation of the LBC of an overly weakened vitrified\nenamel surface layer as a result of a higher built-up in\nstress concentration at the apex. However, the LBC\ndifferences of all investigated geometries of the vitrified\nenamel surface layer would allow a reasonable reaction\ntime, as they are three times higher than the standard\nEuropean specification. In addition, all the geometries\nhave satisfactory overall LBCs, seven times higher than\nthe standard requirement. From the FE model, it was\nfound that the optimum design with the highest safety\nfactor was the flat surface geometry. Having said this,\ndepending upon the environment of operation, the\ndesign can be manipulated depending on the required\nsafety factor. For instance, with a safety factor of one,\nthe curvature of the vitrified enamel layer should fall\nwithin the region of \u00060.15 to 0.40mm; for a safety\nfactor of two, the curvature of the vitrified enamel\nlayer should be within \u00060.08 to \u00fe0.15mm; and for a\nsafety factor of three, the curvature of the vitrified\nenamel layer should lie between \u00060.02mm and\n\u00fe0.05mm.\nREFERENCES\n1 Taylor, G.
