INTRODUCTION\nR\nECENTLY,muchprogresshasbeenmadeinreliabilityen-\ngineering research, and applications, since Bazovski [1]\nidenti\ufb01ed the reliability approach based on risk assessment. For\nelectronic componentsand products, thereare maturereliability\ntheories and techniques. The history of risk or probability as-\nsessment has been considered in some detail by Moss [2], who\nhas described the background and relevance of now well-es-\ntablished methods, such as Failure Mode Effect and Criticality\nAnalysis (FMECA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Moss [2]\nalso pointed out that there is some dif\ufb01culty with mechanical\nreliability prediction, and that the techniques developed many\nyears ago for evaluation of electronic systems and components\nmust be used with some caution when dealing with mechanical\nsystems.\nFailure is a fundamental concept of any reliability analysis\n[3].

Load and strength interference diagram with interference.\npart which renders it incapable of satisfactorily performing its\nintended function [4].\nIn the literature, there are two main approaches used in engi-\nneeringdesigntoanalyzeandpredictmechanicalfailures:stress\nfailure theory, and reliability theory.\nCollins [4] described six stress failure theories:\n1) Maximum normal stress theory,\n2) Maximum shearing stress theory,\n3) Maximum normal strain theory,\n4) Total strain energy theory,\n5) Distortion energy theory, and\n6) Mohr\u2019s failure theory.\nWith the exception of composite materials, the basic assump-\ntionsofallthesefailuretheories arethatthematerialishomoge-\nnous, and that a failure is predicted to occur when the failure\ncriterion is satis\ufb01ed. A safety factor is then applied based on ex-\nperience, design code, or an analysis of the worst loading con-\nditions [5]. These methods do not explicitly take into account\nvariationsincomponentmaterialstrengthduetovariationsfrom\nconstructionand manufacture.The applicationofasafety factor\ntakes into account a wide range of uncertainties including the\napplied loads and variations in material strength.\nAnalternativeapproachisreliabilitytheory[6],[7].Theload-\nstrength interference theory [8]\u2013[13] is a well-known method to\ncalculate the reliability of mechanical components. This early\nwork was carried out by Freudenthal et al. [8], with respect to\nthe safety of structures. The method was also applied to design\nof critical mechanical component by Kececioglu and Cormier\n[14].\nThe probability density functions for both strength and load\nare shown in Fig. 1, and the shaded area where the curves inter-\nfere is an indication that the component will fail. Load-strength\ninterference theory has been used to take into account varia-\ntions in the operating load and strength of mechanical elements\n[8], [12] which are distributed about a mean value, and which\nmay change with time in service operation owing to degrada-\ntion. Variation in the strength of the component may result from\na combination of variations in the metallurgical and fabrication\nprocesses involved with its manufacture, dimensional inaccu-\nracy, surface damage, etc.; whereas variation in the load im-\nposeduponitmayresultfromvariationsinitsduty,andenviron-\nment. The bigger the difference ( ) between strength, and\nstress,asshowninFig.1,thehigherthereliabilityofthecompo-\nFig. 2. Bars with different lengths.\nnent becomes. The use of a safety margin in design calculations\nis attractive, but it depends upon there being suf\ufb01cient informa-\ntion available about strength, and load distributions [15]. The\nsafety factor design approach introduces the safety factor to en-\nlarge the difference between strength, and load.\nThe strength of a component at different points will not re-\nmain constant because defects are introduced during material\nprocessing, and component manufacture. It is widely recog-\nnized by engineers that failure occurs in local \u2019weak spots\u2019.\nConsider the case of two bars, A and B, which have the same\ncross section, and the same applied load, but they have different\nlengths, as shown in Fig. 2. Conventionally, both bars would\nhave the same stress, the same material strength, and the same\nprobability of failure, i.e., they have the same reliability. How-\never,in practice,a long bar is often foundto be less reliablethan\na shorter one [16].\nThe aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between\nthe physical size of a mechanical component, and its reliability.\nA new method is proposed below by which material inho-\nmogeneity may be modeled in a component reliability calcula-\ntion. The strength of a component depends upon the quality of\nthematerials used,and thequalityof constructionand manufac-\nturing processes employed.\nThe new method employs the Monte-Carlo simulation\nmethod, which uses system probability models, and simulation\nof random variables [17], to analyze the relationship between\nthe reliability, and volume, of a mechanical component.\nAcomparisonismadewithtwoexistingcalculationmethods,\nthe load-strength interference method, and the use of a stress\nbased failure criterion plus safety factor, with the new method\npresented in this paper.\nII. MECHANICAL RELIABILITY\nA. Mechanical Failure\nThe maximum normal stress theory [4] is used to de\ufb01ne me-\nchanical failures in this paper:\nFailure is predicted to occur in the multiaxial state of stress\nwhen the maximum principal normal stress becomes equal to\nor exceeds the maximum normal stress at the time of failure\nin a simple uniaxial stress test using a specimen of the same\nmaterial.\nA failure is predicted by this theory to occur if any one ex-\npression is satis\ufb01ed\n(1)\nwhere , , and are the principal normal stresses; could\nbe the uniaxial failure strength in tension ( ) or compression\n( ).\nOf course, this is not the only failure theory which could be\nused in the new method, and other failure theories [4] could be\nadopted too.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

Samples from different batches in a strength test.\nB. Variation of Material Strength\nFrom(1),therearetwofactors:principalnormalstresses( ),\nand the material strength ( ), which determine if a mechanical\nfailure occurs.\nThe stress failure theory plus safety factor method assumes\nthat the stresses and strengths remain constant in any environ-\nment with repeated load, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For example,\nin the case of a bar subject to an axial load, the load induced\nstresses and material strength at any point in the bar are thought\ntobethesame.Intheload-strengthinterferencetheory[8],there\nare variations in both load and strength, as shown in Fig. 3(b).\nVariation in the strength of the component may result from a\ncombination of variations in the metallurgical and fabrication\nprocesses involved with its manufacture, whereas variations in\nthe load result from variations in its duty and environment.\nTo analyze the variation in the material strength, a method\nto calculate the mean value, and standard deviation, of material\nstrength from test data is \ufb01rst investigated. It is assumed that\ntest samples come from different batches, and denotes the\nstrength of Sample in Batch . The number of the samples in\nBatch is . There are batches in the strength test shown in\nFig. 4.\nThe total number of the samples in the test, ,i s\n(2)\nThen the mean value and standard deviation of the material\nstrength could be calculated as\n(3)\n(4)\nHere, another method is introduced to compute them. First,\nthe mean value, and standard deviation, of the material strength\nin Batch are calculated respectively as\n(5)\n(6)\nThen the mean value, and standard deviation, of the material\ncan be calculated as:\n(7)\n(8)\nThe results obtained from the above two methods should be\ndifferent. The mean of the material strength in (3) will be the\nsame with the one in (7) only when there are the same number\nof samples in each batch.\nFor given batch samples, the manufacturing condition, and\nthe material ingredient, could be thought to be the same. The\nmaterial is thought to be homogeneous if each sample has the\nsame strength, that is\n(9)\nActually, it is impossible that the strength of each sample is\nkept the same. This means that the material is inhomogeneous.\nNext, consider another situation. It is assumed that the mate-\nrial is homogeneous in each batch. Other factors will affect the\nmaterial strength, such as the variation of material ingredients,\nand the manufacturing control parameters. There are different\nstrengths in different batches. Then the deviation of material\nstrengths also exists.\nSo two known methods to reduce the deviation of material\nstrength are:\n1) raising the homogeneity of the material (to reduce ),\nand\n2) controlling the stability of material quality in different\nbatches (to reduce ).\nBasedonthe abovebrief discussion, thereare two factorswhich\naffect the variation of the strength of a material:\n1) the material inhomogeneity (or imperfects), and\n2) the material quality stability.\nOnlythemorehomogenousandmorestablethematerialquality\nbecomes, then the less the variation there is in material strength.\nTwo deviations of material strength are introduced:\n1) the standard deviation of material strength related to ma-\nterial inhomogeneity (SDH), and\n2) the standard deviation of material strength related to ma-\nterial quality stability (SDQ).\nRespectively, they are denoted as and , and then we have\nthe following two distributions:\n1) a distribution of material strength related to material in-\nhomogeneity , and\n2) a distribution of material strength related to material\nquality stability .\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

Elements in a component.\nBecause a material is inhomogeneous, there is a different\nstrength at a different place in a given material. The strength\nof a material at one place ( ) in a component, , is a random\nvariable, which can be determined with the distribution of ma-\nterial strength related to material inhomogeneity\n(10)\nThematerialqualitystabilitywillaffectthemeanvalueof the\nmaterial strength related to material inhomogeneity .\n(11)\nC. Mechanical Component Reliability\nFig. 5 shows the cross-section of a component, which is di-\nvided into elements. If the component is a complex structure,\nand its loads are complex too, each element will havea different\nstress. It is assumed that the stress is constant in an element, as\nshown in Fig. 5(b). A failure will occur in this element if\n(12)\nwhere is the stress of element , and is its strength.\nThe component shown in Fig. 5 is assumed to fail if any ele-\nment fails. This is the case of local component failure (de\ufb01ned\nby a failure criterion), under discussion in this paper. A local\nfailuremaynot,ofcourse,leadtototalsystemormissionfailure.\nThe component failure event of the component ( ) could be\nwritten as:\n(13)\nwhere is the whole space of the component. is a random\nevent, and its failure probability is\n(14)\nThe reliability of the component is written as\n(15)\nFig. 6. Flowchart of the Monte-Carlo simulation for mechanical reliability.\nIII. MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION\nA. Monte-Carlo Simulation Flow\nMonte Carlo simulation is often employed in reliability anal-\nysiswhentheanalyticalsolutionisnotattainable,andthefailure\ndomain cannot be expressed or approximated by an analytical\nform. The \ufb02ow of the Monte Carlo simulation for evaluating the\neffect of material inhomogeneity and material quality stability\non the reliability of mechanical components is shown in Fig. 6.\nIf the proportion in the dashed area in Fig. 6 is removed, it\nis just a general Monte-Carlo simulation for determining the re-\nliability of mechanical components. The task of the enclosed\ndashed area is to simulate the effect of the material inhomo-\ngeneity on mechanical reliability.\nThe randomness of random variables can be described by the\nknown probability density function of its distribution. For ex-\nample, the random load will be calculated by using its proba-\nbility density function of the -normal distribution .\nThe main steps of the Monte-Carlo simulation technique as\nshown in Fig. 6 are:\nStep 0: Readinputdata , , , , , ;Let ,\n;\nStep 1: Generate a random load, , from the distribution\n;\nStep 2: Calculatethestress byusingFinite-Elementtools,\nor mechanics methods.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

Number of Selected Points,\nSection II-B shows that the inhomogeneity will affect the\nstrength in the material. The bigger the volume of a component\nis, then the greater the effect will be.\nTo investigate the effect of the inhomogeneity on reliability, a\nnew number, , is introduced to describe the relationship be-\ntween the volume of thecomponent, and itsreliability. In Fig. 6,\nthe load, and , are randomly generated according to their re-\nspective probability density functions. Then the program gener-\nates a range of component strengths according to the material\nstrength related to the distributions , and .\nThismeans thatthereareseveralpoints, , whichareselected,\nto check if a failure occurs.\nThe number of selected points, , is a function of the\nvolume of a component. Generally, increases with the\nvolume of the component. Here the linear relationship is sup-\nposed. This is given by\n(19)\nwhere is the volume of the component, and is de\ufb01ned as\nMaterial Strength Index(MSI).\nIn this paper, Material Strength Index is set as a constant.\nIf there is only one point selected\n(20)\nthen the result should be equal to the result obtained from the\nload-strength interference theory.\nThe number of selected point, , will be an integer. But\nfrom (19) is a real number. For example, if ,\nthen there are two methods to set : one is that , and\nanother is that . Here a random method is introduced.\nFunction returns the integer part of , thus returning\n14. First, a random real number is generated, which is in [0,\n1]. If is less than or equal to , then is set to\n,o r is set to . This is\nif\nif\n(21)\nC. Selection of Material Strength Index\nThe MSI, , has a strong effect on the results obtained by\nusing the method shown in Fig. 6. The material strength index\nshould be calculated carefully as follows.\nOrdinarily, mechanical properties are obtained from exper-\nimental results. So that test results will be comparable, the\ndimensions of test specimens, and the methods of applying\nloads, have been standardised. One of the major standards\norganizations is the American Society for Testing and Material\n(ASTM). The ASTM standard tension specimen has a diameter\nof 0.505 inches, and a gauge length of 2.0 inches [18]. This\nmeans that the volume of the specimen is\nmm (22)\nIt is supposed the reliability of the standard specimen ob-\ntained from the above Monte-Carlo simulation method is equal\nto the one calculated by using the load-strength interference\ntheory. This implies that the number of selected point in\nFig. 6 should be equal to 1. From (19), we have\n(23)\nThen\nmm\n(24)\nIf the volume of a component is less than the one of the stan-\ndard specimen, the number of selected points that are ob-\ntained from (21) could be zero or one. At that time, the com-\nponent reliability will be greater than the standard specimen.\nWhen the volume is very small, and approaches zero, the re-\nliability approaches one because there is no volume in which\nmaterial defects can occur. This is\n(25)\nThis may be true, but it should be provedby the test and prac-\ntise. Here, conservatively let\n(26)\nEquation (26) means that when the volume of a component is\nless than that of the standard specimen, which is used to deter-\nmine the material strength, its reliability or failure probability is\nthe same with the one of the standard specimen.\nThe above method to determine the Material Strength Index\nwill not affect the Monte Carlo simulation method presented in\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

EXAMPLES AND ANALYSIS\nThecasesofbarssubjecttotensileloadingareusedtoanalyze\nthe effect of material inhomogeneity on mechanical reliability.\nThe parameters investigated in this paper using the proposed\nanalysis method are:\n\u2022 standard deviation of material strength related to material\ninhomogeneity,\n\u2022 applied load, and\n\u2022 bar length and radius.\nIn this section, all the simulation results were averaged over\n50 runs, and in each run the simulation number was set to 1000.\nA. Theoretical Reliability\nHere the conventional load-strength interference theory is\nused to calculate the bar theoretical reliability. Let be the bar\nradius, and be the bar length. It is assumed that the distribu-\ntions of all the random variables are -normal distributions.\nThe distribution of the cross area of the bar is also the -normal\ndistribution , its mean value is\n(27)\nand the cross-area standard deviation is\n(28)\nThe stress distribution is , and its mean value is\n(29)\nHere is the load or force, is its mean value, and is\nits standard deviation. The standard deviation of the stress is\nwritten as\n(30)\nAccording to the load-strength interference theory, the theo-\nretical reliability of the bar is\n(31)\nwhere , and are respectively the mean value, and standard\ndeviation of material strength.

Performance of load or force on reliability.\nthis case, the bar reliability drops from 0.880594 to 0.829198.\nIt is interesting that when is set to zero, the reliability is\nequal to the theoretical reliability 0.881000 obtained by using\ntheload-strengthinterferencetheory,whichisshowninTableII.\nThismeansthat,ifthematerialishomogeneous,theresultfound\nby using the new method is the same as the one calculated with\nthe load-strength interference theory. If material is inhomoge-\nneous, the reliability obtained through the load-strength inter-\nference theory is higher.\nC. Effects of Applied Loads and Bar Radius on Reliability\nAccording to the load-strength interference theory, the stress\ndistribution of a component, and the material strength distribu-\ntion determine its reliability. The difference between the stress,\nand strength is written as\n(35)\nThe smaller the value of , the larger the shaded area be-\ncomes, as in Fig. 8, and the higher the failure probability of the\ncomponent. The reliability decreasesas the load (appliedstress)\nincreases.\nThere are two factors which affect the stress: the load, and\nthe radius of the bar. With the same parameter settings, which\nare shown in Table I (except the load, and radius variations)\nthe results obtained by using the new Monte-Carlo simulation\nmethod in Section III are shown in Figs. 9 and 10.\nIn Fig. 9, the load varies from 0 to 100000N. The load varies\nbetween 0 and 80000N in Fig. 9(a), and from 80000N to\n100000N in Fig. 9(b). Fig. 9 shows that, as the load increases,\nthe bar reliability decreases. The reason is, of course, that the\nincrease of the load ( ) will results to the increase of the stress\nFig. 10. Performance of radius and \uffff on reliability.\nand the decrease of the distance between the stress and its\nstrength in (35), so that the shaded area increases. Therefore\nthere are more opportunities for a failure to occur, and the\nreliability will decrease.\nFig. 10 illustrates the relationship between the bar reliability\nand the bar radius, and the standard deviation of material\nstrength related to material inhomogeneity . The bar radius\nvaries from 6.5 to 24 mm, and from 0 to 15 MPa.\nThe reliability rises sharply because the cross sectional area\nincreases dramatically with the square of the radius, and the\nstress reduces accordingly. However, an interesting thing hap-\npens when the bar radius is larger than 7 mm in this case. If\nis less than 5 MPa, the reliability increases rapidly, and remains\nconstant at the top level when the radius is bigger than 10 (mm).\nHowever, when is larger than 5 (MPa), the reliability drops,\nand then increases until it reaches unity.\nA possible explanation is that the radius has appeared to have\ntwo different effects on reliability. The \ufb01rst one is that when the\nradius increases, the stress drops sharply and so the reliability\nrises. However, the increase of the bar radius results in the in-\ncrease of the bar volume, which leads to more opportunities for\nafailure tooccur.Theincreaseinbarvolumereducesreliability.\nThe decrease in reliability means that the volume has a strong\neffect on failures due to the higher value of . The increase of\nthe bar radius results in the stress pdf to move to the left, and\nthe shaded area in Fig. 11 will decrease, and thus increase re-\nliability. However, the increase of will let the strength pdf\nbecome wide, so that the shaded area will increase, and then\nthe reliability decreases. The two factors lead to the behaviors\nshown in Fig. 10.\nD. Effects of Bar Length on Reliability\nFigs. 12 and 13 show the relationship between the reliability,\nand the bar length. The bar length varies between 50.8 and 110\n(mm) in Fig. 12, and from 0 to 1000 times of the length of the\nstandard specimen in Fig. 13. Other parameters remain constant\nas given in Table I. The specimen length used is 50.8 mm (2in).\nForbarswithalengthgreaterthan50.8mm,thebarvolumeis\nbiggerthanthespecimenvolume.Therefore,duetothevariation\nin the material strength related to material inhomogeneity, the\nfailure probability rises, and so the reliability decreases with\nthe increase of the bar length. Fig. 12 shows the decrease in bar\nreliability as the bar length (and hence volume) increases.\nFig. 13 shows how reliability varies with the bar length and\nSDH. The increase of the bar length results in the increase of its\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford. Downloaded on December 14, 2009 at 02:48 from IEEE Xplore.

This means that, if the material is ho-\nmogeneous, the reliability does not vary with the increase of the\nvolume of a component, and its reliability is equal to the one\ncalculatedbyusingtheconventionalLoad-Strengthinterference\ntheory.\nE.

It can be seen that, if the material is inho-\nmogeneous with , then the safety factor method with\nunderestimates the required radius of the bar.\nTherefore, the method proposed in this paper gives results\nwhich are comparable with conventional load-strength interfer-\nence, and the safety factor methods.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nA method of analysis is proposed which takes into account\nmaterial inhomogeneity such that the reliability of components\nof different sizes, but subject to the same applied stress, can\nbe calculated. The method is a development of conventional\nload-strengthinterferencetheory.Theproposedmethodisbased\non a Monte-Carlo method; and the results have been compared\nto both the conventional load-interference theory, and a cal-\nculation method based on nominal stress, plus a safety factor.\nIf the material is assumed to be homogeneous, then the new\nmethod gives the same results as the conventional load-interfer-\nence method. If thematerial is assumed not to be homogeneous,\nthen the new method calculates that larger dimensioned compo-\nnents are required to achieve a desired reliability. Unless large\nsafety factors are chosen, then the safety factor method will un-\nderestimate the size of components for high reliability.\nThe method provides an opportunity to explore the effect of\ncomponent volume on reliability calculations. For key compo-\nnents, the method provides an opportunity for designers and re-\nliability engineers to undertake sensitivity analyses concerning\nthe possible effect of component size on reliability for different\ndegrees of material inhomogeneity. To calculate speci\ufb01c values\nof reliability, the method requires material data which is not\nrecorded generally at the present time. However, it is quite fea-\nsible to obtain the data by a test program, say in the case of\ncertain safety critical components.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I. Bazovski, Reliability Theory and Practice.
