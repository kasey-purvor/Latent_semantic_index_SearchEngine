It\nhas received considerable attention due to its potential ca-\npacity to act as a source or sink of atmospheric carbon diox-\nide (Grace et al., 1995a; Lloyd and Farquhar, 1996, 2008;\nPhillips et al., 1998; Prentice and Lloyd, 1998; Tian et al.,\n1998; Chambers and Silver, 2004; Lewis et al., 2004). Re-\nsults from global carbon cycle models have suggested a po-\ntential significant effect of Amazonian forests on estimates\nof the global carbon budget (Prentice and Lloyd, 1998; Tian\net al., 1998; Cox et al., 2000). Indeed, the study of Cox et\nal. (2000), predicts large-scale forest dieback across Amazo-\nnia in the 21st century, with associated emissions contribut-\ning to an amplification of human-induced climate change.\nSuch results need to be refined using calibrated models that\nare better constrained by data from the Amazon region.\nThese should lead to improved present and future carbon bal-\nances predictions for Amazonia. This is of vital importance\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1248 L. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis\nfor the accuracy of global climate-carbon cycle models and\ntheir projections of future atmospheric carbon dioxide con-\ncentration and climate.\nAlthough land surface schemes within Global Circulation\nModels (GCMs) currently represent vegetation in terms of\na small set of plant functional types (PFTs) (Sitch et al.,\n2003), progress is now being made in this respect, associ-\nated with a greater appreciation of the physiological diver-\nsity of the many different species and the wide diversity of\nsoil types in the region (Fyllas et al., 2009). Thus although\nthe entire Amazon rainforest is taken as one physiologically\nuniform entity, it is now appropriate for models of Amazon\nforest gas exchange to incorporate variations in plant physi-\nological characteristics and soil properties.\nThe increased availability of eddy correlation flux data has\nbeen very useful for calibrating and evaluating model abil-\nity to simulate measurements and ecosystem responses to\ndifferent environmental variables. Nevertheless it is impor-\ntant to note some limitations of the method, such as a fail-\nure to close the energy balance (Massman and Lee, 2002;\nWilson et al., 2002; Baldocchi, 2003; Finnigan et al., 2003)\nand that the method only estimates the net ecosystem car-\nbon exchange. This comprises two large and opposing fluxes\nassociated with processes that often occur simultaneously:\nviz. photosynthesis by leaves, and whole-ecosystem respira-\ntion, i.e. the combination of plant and heterotrophic respi-\nration. Separating the net flux into its components is non-\ntrivial, and is usually achieved by relating respiration to the\nnet ecosystem exchange measured during night-time. There\nare two drawbacks in estimating ecosystem respiration us-\ning this method: first, daytime ecosystem respiration differs\nfrom night-time due to temperature differences, especially\nat the canopy level. Second, and most importantly, there is\na frequent failure of the system to measure night-time res-\npiration fluxes at low wind speed conditions (Aubinet et al.,\n2002; Massman and Lee, 2002; Pattey et al., 2002; Saleska\net al., 2003).\nCarbon isotope measurements of plant tissues (\u03b413C) place\na constraint on models of isotopic discrimination during pho-\ntosynthesis (Aranibar et al., 2006). These measurements for\nC3 plants give an indication of the average intercellular CO2\nconcentration (Ci) during photosynthetic periods (Farquhar\net al., 1982). This metric has been used in modelling studies\nto constrain the stomatal conductance parameters (Aranibar\net al., 2006).\nUnder the assumption of nitrogen (N) limitation, leaf pho-\ntosynthesis is usually modelled based on the measured lin-\nearity between photosynthetic capacity and N content per\nunit leaf area (Hirose and Werger, 1987; Evans, 1993). Leaf\nphotosynthesis is scaled up to canopy level based on the hy-\npothesis that N partitioning within canopies varies with irra-\ndiance in such a way as to maximize whole-canopy photo-\nsynthesis (Evans, 1993). This optimal approach to N parti-\ntioning is frequently used in the modelling community. How-\never, for tropical ecosystems leaf phosphorous (P) rather than\nleaf N may be the key nutrient limiting productivity of low-\nland rainforests, where soils are highly weathered, phospho-\nrous availability is low and nitrogen is relatively abundant\n(Vitousek and Sanford, 1986). Aside from the importance\nof many sugar-phosphates in photosynthesis and respiration,\nphosphorous plays an essential role in energy metabolism be-\ncause of its presence in important molecules that store energy\nwhich are essential to the Calvin cycle. Therefore, deficien-\ncies in phosphorus can limit the rates of RuBP regeneration\n(RuBP is the CO2 acceptor molecule in the Calvin cycle)\nand consequently carbon assimilation (Campbell and Sage,\n2006). It is likely the low P concentrations in tropical forest\nleaves may constrain photosynthetic rate, at least for some\ntropical forests (Lloyd et al., 2001). Lloyd et al. (2009) have\nalso shown that the \u201coptimal\u201d gradient of N and P within\nplant canopies is actually less steep than has often been con-\nsidered the case, especially when overall nutrient concentra-\ntions are low.\nThe motivation behind this study is thus to refine ecosys-\ntem gas exchange models in order to better represent the\ngross carbon uptake of forests in the Amazon Basin, utilis-\ning available eddy correlation data and other field observa-\ntions, for model calibration and evaluation. Then, we can\nderive upscaling relationships of canopy photosynthesis ap-\npropriate for basin-wide simulations. We first assess model\nperformance of simulated carbon uptake and energy partition\nat five rainforest sites in the Amazon basin using eddy cor-\nrelation flux data and identify the main limitations of such\na model-data evaluation exercise. We take the sun\/shade\nmodel for photosynthesis (de Pury and Farquhar, 1997) cou-\npled to a stomatal conductance model (Cowan and Farquhar,\n1977), previously calibrated at one rainforest site, as de-\nscribed in Mercado et al. (2006). This coupled model is ap-\nplied at 5 eddy correlation sites across Amazonia. It is cali-\nbrated and then evaluated using fluxes of carbon and energy\nderived from eddy correlation data, and measurements of fo-\nliar carbon isotope fractionation (Lloyd et al., 2009; Fyllas et\nal., 2009). Then, we derive a canopy scaling function to scale\nGPP to the basin level. Here we relate canopy maximum car-\nboxylation capacity of Rubisco activity (Vmax) at each site\nto foliar N. Additionally, given the possibility of phosphorus\ndeficiency in tropical leaves being an important constraint\non photosynthesis (Lloyd et al., 2001), relationships between\nVmax and foliar phosphorus are also explored.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Data\n2.1.1 Tower sites\nEddy correlation measurements made above five primary\nrainforest sites in the Brazilian Amazon (averaged over\nhourly time steps) with associated meteorological variables,\nBiogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/\nL.

Locations of rainforest sites with eddy correlation systems\nused in this study.\nvalues are derived from wet bulb temperatures at Manaus\nC14 and Caxiuana, from dew point temperatures at Tapajos\nand from relative humidity measurements at Jaru and Man\nK34.\n2.1.3 Carbon fluxes\nFluxes of carbon dioxide correspond to net ecosystem ex-\nchange rates (NE). In order to determine the net canopy\nassimilation rate (i.e. total photosynthesis minus daytime\ncanopy leaf respiration RC), GP or gross canopy assimila-\ntion rate (i.e. total photosynthesis, which includes daytime\nleaf respiration) (GP\u2217), it is necessary to consider the non-\nleaf ecosystem respiration rate RE\u2217 or the total ecosystem\nrespiration rate RE , respectively, and carbon dioxide accu-\nmulated inside the canopy:\nGP = \u2212NE + RE\u2217 (1)\nGP \u2217 = GP + RC = \u2212NE + RE (2)\nNE = FC +\nht\u222b\n0\n\u2202Ca\n\u2202t\ndz (3)\nwhere Fc is the flux of CO2 measured by eddy correla-\ntion (\u00b5mol m2 s\u22121) and the integrand, often referred to as\n\u201cthe change in canopy storage flux\u201d (\u00b5mol m2 s\u22121), repre-\nsents the rate of change in the CO2 concentration (Ca) within\nthe canopy between the forest floor and the eddy correlation\nmeasurement height, ht . Canopy CO2 storage flux (ST ) is\nestimated from measurements of within canopy CO2 concen-\ntrations and it is usually measured along with eddy correla-\ntion flux data.\nOf the five sites, the canopy storage flux was determined\nfrom measurements at Manaus K34, Tapajos, Jaru and Cax-\niuana. Data from Manaus C14 only includes storage mea-\nsurements for the period October\u2013November 1995. Lacking\nmeasurements at Manaus C14 for the remaining period of\nstudy and at Jaru, simulated storage fluxes (provided by col-\nlaborators) were used.\nTo calculate photosynthesis from measured eddy correla-\ntion NE , it was necessary to use either GP or GP \u2217 depending\nupon the ecosystem respiration available at each individual\nsite. At sites where it was possible to estimate the sepa-\nrate contributions to ecosystem respiration, i.e. from stems\nand branches, soil and coarse litter (Man K34, Jaru and Man\nC14), the net assimilation rate, GP , was used. This term\naccounts for the balance of the parallel processes of photo-\nsynthesis and leaf respiration. At Man K34, Jaru and Man\nC14 the \u201cobserved\u201d GP was calculated as:\nGP = \u2212NE + RE\u2217 = \u2212NE + RS + RW + RCS (4)\nRE NL is the sum of all respiratory contributions from\nsoil (autotrophic and heterotrophic on a ground area basis),\ncoarse litter, stems and branches. RW represents the respi-\nration contribution from stems and branches, RS from soil\n(which includes root and fine litter decomposition at the soil\nsurface) and RCS accounts for coarse litter respiration. At\nsites where ecosystem respiration was given as a single flux\n(Caxiuana and Tapajos), Gross photosynthesis, GP \u2217 , is used.\nAt Tapajos and Caxiuana, total ecosystem respiration was\navailable and GP \u2217 was calculated as:\nGP \u2217 = \u2212NE + RE (5)\nwhere RE is defined as RE\u2217 plus respiratory contributions\nfrom daytime leaf canopy respiration.\nTo derive GP or GP \u2217 at the five tower sites, different\nmethodologies for estimating ecosystem respiration had to be\nused, these again dependent upon the techniques employed\nby the original investigators.\nEcosystem respiration for both Manaus sites, and Jaru,\nwas calculated using measurements from its single compo-\nnents (Eq. 4) and for Tapajos and Caxiuana, ecosystem res-\npiration was derived from night time measurements of NE .\nA summary of how ecosystem respiration was calculated for\neach site is included in Table 3.\n2.1.4 Foliar carbon isotopes, N and P content and leaf\narea index\nMeasurements of foliar carbon isotopic composition as de-\nscribed in Lloyd et al.

This division of sunlit and\nshaded foliage changes with both the portion of the incom-\ning irradiance that is diffuse, as well as the solar elevation\nangle, and therefore canopy photosynthetic capacity of the\nsunlit and shaded portions is dynamic. Sunlit leaves are\nmodelled to receive direct and diffuse radiation while shaded\nleaves receive only diffuse radiation. Details about the model\nand equations for canopy photosynthesis are included in Ap-\npendix A.\n2.2.2 Radiation absorption and energy balance\nUsing formulations developed by Goudriaan (1977) as pre-\nsented in Wang and Leuning (1998) and de Pury and Far-\nquhar (1997), absorption of Photosynthetically Active Radi-\nation (PAR) and near infrared radiation (NIR) was estimated\nfor the sun\/shade model. The net energy available to the sun-\nlit and shaded leaf was calculated as the sum of net absorbed\nPAR, net absorbed NIR and net absorbed long wave by each\nleaf.\nSince leaf temperature is needed to calculate long wave\nradiation, net isothermal radiation is calculated for the sun\nand shaded leaves, which are partitioned between the la-\ntent and sensible heat fluxes following the isothermal form\nof the Penman-Monteith equation (Jones, 1992), assuming\nground evaporation and soil heat flux to be negligible.

(2001)\nassumption is based on the observation that typically only\n1% of the radiation received at the top of the canopy reaches\nthe forest floor (Shuttleworth, 1989). For example, soil heat\nfluxes represent only 2% of the daytime net radiation at Tapa-\njos (da Rocha et al., 2004). Since energy stored in biomass\nand in the canopy air and chemical energy used for CO2 ex-\nchange are small in quantity, these terms were also neglected.\n2.2.3 Leaf biochemistry and stomatal conductance\nThe leaf level photosynthesis model used here includes the\nbiochemistry of C3 photosynthesis from Farquhar and von\nCaemmerer (1982) (Eqs. A3 to A6) and stomatal conduc-\ntance is calculated with the equation from Cowan and Far-\nquhar (1977), called the \u201cLambda\u201d model (Eq. A7). Descrip-\ntion of both models is included in Appendix A.\n2.2.4 Isotopic composition of leaves \u03b413C\nIsotopic composition of leaves \u03b413C (\u2030) was calculated for\nthe canopy following Farquhar et al. (1982) as:\n\u03b413C=\u03b4atm\u2212a\u2212(b\u2212a)Ci\/Ca (6)\nwhere a corresponds to the maximum fractionation due to\ndiffusion of CO2 in air (4.4\u2030) and b is the maximum frac-\ntionation in the carboxylation reaction (30\u2030) (Farquhar et\nal., 1982). \u03b4atm is \u03b413C of the air, taken as \u22128.0(\u2030), the\nlate twentieth century mean atmospheric background value\n(Ehleringer et al., 1987). The ratio Ci\/Ca corresponds to\nsimulated daytime hourly values from the whole canopy. The\nsimulated average integral of photosynthetic discrimination\nduring the different seasons analyzed (\u03b4 13C) is calculated\nwith Eq. (6) using the photosynthetic flux weighted average\n(Ci\/Ca):\n\u03b413C=\u221212.4\u221225.6\nn\u2211\ni=1\nGP i \u2217 (Ci\/Ca)\u2211n\ni=1 GP i\n(7)\nEquation 6 does not include re-fixation of soil and plant\nrespired CO2. However, measured values of \u03b413C are from\ntop of the canopy leaves and as shown by Lloyd et al. (1996),\nrecycling at this level in the canopy is minimal (<5%).\n2.3 Model parameterisation\nCanopy level maximum carboxylation activity of Rubisco\n(Vmax) was estimated using Eqs. (A1) and (A2). This as-\nsumes an exponential decrease in Vmax with height (or more\nprecisely with cumulative leaf area) as was observed for the\nprofile of Vmax derived from gas exchange measurements at\nthe Manaus C14 site (Carswell et al., 2000) and parame-\nterised in Mercado et al. (2006) for the sun and shade model\nfor the Manaus C14 site. From the Mercado et al. (2006) pa-\nrameterisation, Vmax for the top and bottom 50% of canopy\nleaves averages 65% and 35% of the Vmax of the uppermost\nleaves, respectively. Having defined this distribution of Vmax\nwith cumulative leaf area, total canopy Vmax was then cal-\nculated at each site as the integral of leaf level Vmax over\ncumulative leaf area index, as described in Eq. (A1). Lloyd\net al. (2009) discuss gradients in nutrients within Amazon\nforests in general and conclude that for trees growing on such\nrelatively infertile soils, such shallow within canopy gradi-\nents should, indeed, exist.\nCanopy level respiration (expressed on a ground area ba-\nsis) was simulated for all sites using the parameterisation for\nthe sun and shade model from Mercado et al. (2006) as de-\nrived from Carswell et al. (2000), and was assumed to de-\ncrease exponentially with cumulative leaf area index. Respi-\nration at the top of the canopy was taken as a constant frac-\ntion of Vmax from top leaves (i.e. 0.022\u00d7Vmax) for all sites\n(de Pury and Farquhar, 1997). Total canopy respiration RC\nwas subsequently calculated using the same nitrogen allo-\ncation coefficient (kn) obtained for the exponential regres-\nsion of Vmax against cumulative leaf area index (Eq. A2),\nwith a temperature dependence of canopy respiration given\nby Lloyd and Taylor (1994).\nThe model was calibrated using a simplex procedure to\nminimize the error sum of squares of the modelled photo-\nsynthesis minus the sum of net ecosystem exchange as mea-\nsured by eddy correlation plus the estimated ecosystem res-\npiration (Table 3) from a selected subset of data from each\nsite (Nelder and Mead, 1965). Criteria of selection followed\nthe same conditions as in Lloyd et al. (1995) and in Grace\net al. (1995b). To avoid the CO2 flush or so-called morning\npeak, data before 09:00 was not used for model parameteri-\nsation. Storage flux values larger than 10 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121 and\nsmaller than \u221210 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121 were also neglected as were\ndata points collected during and after rainfall. Measurements\nwhere radiation fluctuated as a result of a moving cloud (i.e.\nabrupt changes in solar radiation from hour to hour) were\nalso filtered together with aerodynamic conductances lower\nthan 0.1 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121.\nThe following parameters (from Eqs. A3, A5 and A6)\nwere estimated from the fitting procedure: top of the canopy\nVmax, the ratio Jmax\/Vmax and the canopy level quantum\nyield (8). We decided to fit quantum yield to the observa-\ntions because a comparison from the light response curves\nof NE derived from eddy correlation measurements for the\nBiogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/\nL. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis 1253\nvarious sites (Fig. B1), indicates variations in slope of the\nlinear part of the curves at the different sites. The remaining\nparameters for the sun\/shade model, viz. the curvature factor\nof the light response curve, \u03b8 (Eq. A5), and the temperature\nsensitivity parameters of the electron transport rate (Eq. A8\nSJ and HJ ) and Rubisco (Eq. A7) and leaf respiration tem-\nperature sensitivities (Eq. A10) were taken from Mercado\net al. (2006) (i.e. \u03b8 and HJ were taken as parameterised in\nthe study of Carswell et al. (2000) at the leaf level and SJ\nwas taken as fitted for the sun\/shade model in Mercado et al.,\n2006). The model was calibrated using eddy correlation data\nfrom end of the dry season for all sites. The parameterization\nfor Manaus C14 was taken from Mercado et al. (2006).\nLeaf reflectance and transmittance were assumed identical\nat all sites. Values were taken from the study of Poorter et\nal. (1995) where measurements were made along a vertical\ngradient in canopies in a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica.\nAs in Katul et al. (2000) and Aranibar et al. (2006), we use\nfoliar carbon isotopes measurements from the different sites\nto help constrain the parameterisation of lambda (\u03bb) model\nof stomatal conductance (Eq. A11). Initial values of \u03bb were\ncalculated using the Farquhar and Lloyd (1994) version of\nthe model that allows \u03bb to be estimated from Ci\/Ca , the de-\nrived from the \u03b413C measurements and the long-term vapour\npressure deficit (D\u00af):\n\u03bb \u2248 1.6D\u00af(Ca \u2212 T\n\u2217)\nC2c\n[\n1\u2212 C\u00afi\nCa\n]2 (8)\nSubsequently, following Aranibar et al. (2006), values of \u03bb\nthat produced similar simulated discrimination as foliar iso-\ntope ratios measured at the different sites were chosen.\n2.4 Model evaluation\nSimulated net carbon uptake and energy partition were eval-\nuated using eddy correlation data for all sites. Because eddy\ncorrelation measurements above forest ecosystems often fail\nenergy balance closure tests (Massman and Lee, 2002; Wil-\nson et al., 2002; Baldocchi, 2003; Finnigan et al., 2003), it is\nmore practical to test model performance of energy partition\nusing the evaporative fraction (defined as the ratio between\nthe latent heat flux and the sum of the latent and sensible\nheat fluxes). There is considerable variability in the hourly\ncalculated evaporative fraction, therefore model performance\nis evaluated using the mean diurnal cycles of measured and\nsimulated evaporative fraction. In addition, simulated \u03b413C\nvalues are compared to measurements of foliar isotopic frac-\ntionation as described above. Having an accurate simulated\n\u03b413C helps to substantiate the results for simulated photosyn-\nthetic uptake and at the same time \u03b413C fixes the range within\nwhich \u03bb in Eq. (A11) can vary. By increasing or decreas-\ning \u03bb, the partition of energy into sensible and latent heat\nfluxes is changed and the model can easily fit the measured\nenergy balance, but at the same time the lambda parameter\naffects the photosynthetic rate through Ci\/Ca and thus the\nsimulated \u03b413C. Therefore a realistically simulated \u03b413C is\na valuable diagnostic for testing the validity of \u03bb, applied in\na fully linked carbon\/water\/energy exchange model as used\nhere.\nSimulations of carbon uptake are compared with the ob-\nservations using RMSE and regression coefficient (R2) and\nslope of the linear regression line of observed and simulated\ndata pairs. Model performance is also evaluated by compar-\ning simulated light response of photosynthesis, diurnal cycle\nof evaporative fraction and canopy \u03b413C with observations.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data-model calibration\nBest fitting values for top of the canopy Vmax, ratio of\nJmax\/Vmax and canopy level quantum yield, and non fitted\nparameters used for all simulations are presented in Table 5.\n3.2 Model performance: carbon uptake and energy\npartition\nStatistics of model performance for carbon uptake are in-\ncluded in Table 6 for all sites and seasons studied. The mean\nlight response and diurnal cycles of hourly observations and\nsimulations of GP (for both Manaus sites and Jaru) and GP \u2217\nfor Caxiuana and Tapajos are presented in Figs. 2 and 3,\nrespectively. Mean diurnal cycle of observed and simulated\nevaporative fraction is shown in Fig. 4 and comparison of ob-\nserved and simulated \u03b413C is shown in Table 7. Results for\neach study site are discussed separately.\n3.2.1 Manaus C14\nThe sun\/shade model simulates reasonably well the three sea-\nsons tested within the error bars of the observations at this\nsite (see Table 6 for statistics). However, GP estimated from\neddy correlation measurements during the end of dry season\nof 1995 and the dry season of 1996 is overestimated by the\nmodel by 8% and 10%, respectively. Such overestimation\nseems to occur mainly during the morning during both sea-\nsons (Fig. 3). In 1995 this occurs during high radiation values\n(PAR higher than 1000 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121) and in 1996 at all ra-\ndiation levels (Fig. 2, top row). This is associated with the\nstorage fluxes used for calculation of NE (Eq. 3). For this\nsite, the storage fluxes used were model output. Compari-\nson of simulated storage fluxes against observations (for the\navailable period) show a tendency to under predict the mea-\nsurements in the morning, implying low estimates of mea-\nsured NE , respectively (Fig. B2). This may be one reason\nfor the model to show a tendency to overestimate morning\nnet carbon uptake fluxes.\nSimulated energy partition (Fig. 4) shows good agree-\nment with observations at all studied seasons for this site.\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009\n1254 L.

However,\nwith a higher \u03bb, the model predicts a higher evaporation rate,\nconsequently increasing the simulated evaporative fraction,\nwhich leads to an over prediction of observed energy parti-\ntion (not shown).\n3.2.2 Man K34\nIn terms of carbon uptake, there is good agreement between\nobservations and simulations (see Table 6 for statistics), with\nonly an 8% model overestimation during the end of the\ndry season in 2000.

Closer inspection\nreveals that this is linked to high vapour pressure deficit (DC)\nand air temperatures usually after 11:00 local time. This\nproblem could be linked to the stomatal conductance model\nused not being sufficiently sensitive to such conditions. The\nsensitivity of the model was tested using different \u03bb, values\n(results not shown). Nevertheless, the bias towards high DC\nand high temperatures persisted.\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009\n1258 L. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis\nAccording to Lloyd et al. (2009) and Fyllas et al. (2009),\n\u03b413C at the top of the canopy varies within a range of (\u221230\nand \u221234\u2030) with a mean value of \u221232.05\u00b12.0 (\u2030) from\nleaves collected at all heights, implying the sun and shade\nsimulations are probably satisfactory in terms of modelled\ncarbon exchange during all seasons (Table 7).\nEnergy partition was reasonably well simulated in the dry\nand end of dry season with the exception of the rainy sea-\nson of 2000 where the model under-estimated the measured\nevaporative fraction (Fig. 4). Note that during the season\nwhen the best model data fit was obtained for carbon uptake\n(i.e. rainy season 2000), with closest simulated \u03b413C to ob-\nservations, the worst fit for energy partition was obtained.\nA sensitivity test showed that the model fit to observed\nevaporative fraction during the rainy season of 2000 can\nbe improved by artificially increasing the \u03bb parameter\nfrom 2000 to 3000 mol mol\u22121. However, increasing \u03bb to\n3000 mol mol\u22121 changes the partition between latent and\nsensible heat (increasing evaporation rates), improving the\nmodel comparison to evaporative fraction but at the cost of\na decrease in the simulated \u03b413C (more negative) which leads\nto model underestimation of \u03b413C with respect to the mea-\nsurements (results not shown).\n3.2.3 Jaru\nSimulated carbon uptake was best during the rainy and end\nof the dry seasons. However, the model overestimated ob-\nserved carbon uptake by 13% during the dry season (Figs. 2\u2013\n4). As for Manaus K34, the model has a bias towards over-\nestimating net carbon uptake after midday, which is linked to\nhigh DC and high air temperature conditions. Nevertheless,\nthe model obtains a good comparison to leaf carbon isotope\nmeasurements (Table 7). In terms of energy partition, the\nmodel agrees with the observations during the dry and end of\ndry seasons but underestimates evaporation rates during the\nrainy season. Again, as for Manaus K34, the best model fit\nto observations for photosynthesis is obtained at the cost of\nthe worst model fit to observations of energy partition.\nAs the model was calibrated on data from the end of the\ndry season at all sites, a tendency to overestimate net car-\nbon uptake fluxes during the dry season was not totally un-\nexpected and could be explained as follows by a variety\nof phenomena, perhaps acting in concert: (1) decreases in\ncanopy conductance due to higher DC during the dry season,\n(2) decreases in canopy conductance due to low soil water\navailability and (3) underestimation of the prescribed soil\nrespiration used to calculate GP from eddy correlation and\n(4) reductions of canopy LAI due to leaf fall. Hereafter, each\npossibility is explored.\n(1) Decreases in canopy conductance due to high DC\nduring the dry season\nMeasured values of DC during the dry season at this site in\nyear 2000 were higher than during the rainy and end of dry\nseason. The model over prediction of carbon uptake during\nthis time could be linked to an insufficient stomatal closure at\nhigh DC . Aiming to improve the model fit to carbon uptake,\n\u03bb, was therefore artificially decreased from 2000 mol mol\u22121\nto 1000 mol mol\u22121 and a very good fit to carbon uptake ob-\nservations was then obtained. However, this resulted in a re-\nduced simulated evaporative fraction, with values lower than\nobserved (not shown). Under this parameterisation, simu-\nlated \u03b413C (\u221224.65) is much less negative than observed\n(\u221232.3\u00b12.0).\n(2) Decreases in canopy conductance due to low soil\nwater availability\nAccording to von Randow et al. (2004), during 2000 no ap-\nparent direct effects of soil moisture deficit on canopy gas-\nexchange were detectable. Therefore, it seems unlikely that\nmodelled fluxes overestimation during 2000 are a conse-\nquence of lower canopy conductances due to soil moisture\ndeficits. In another modelling approach, Lloyd et al. (1995)\nused eddy correlation flux data for the same site during dry\nand wet seasons of 1992 and 1993 and also found no in-\ndication of soil moisture deficits on canopy carbon uptake\nonce the DC effects had been taken into account. Indeed,\nvon Randow et al. (2004) measured the soil moisture pro-\nfile down to 3.4 m for the period February 1999\u2013September\n2002 and found indications of ongoing water extraction from\ndepth, especially during the dry season, this being attributed\nto continued root water uptake to satisfy transpirational de-\nmands, although some lateral drainage was not excluded.\n(3) Low values of prescribed soil respiration rate used to\ncalculate GP from eddy correlation\nEcosystem respiration at this site was estimated using soil\nrespiration that was assumed diurnally and seasonally invari-\nant, as there is little indication of seasonal differences in ef-\nflux rates from rainforest soil at Jaru and near constant soil\ntemperatures as already discussed by Meir et al. (1996) and\nLloyd et al. (1995). However, it has been shown that for other\nsites (Davidson et al., 2000; Sotta et al., 2004) soil water may\nplay an important role in regulating the CO2 efflux from the\nsoil especially in dry periods during and soon after precipi-\ntation events. Davidson et al. (2000) reports optimum condi-\ntions for soil respiration at intermediate water contents with\ndecreases in respiration at water contents both above and be-\nlow that value. Therefore, soil respiration could have been\nhigher than assumed during the dry season. However, Meir\net al. (2008) conclude that short term moisture limitation can\nlead to significant reductions of total soil respiration and rec-\nognize the lack of a mechanistically and spatially accurately\ndescription of the response of soil respiration to variations in\nsoil moisture across the Amazon basin.\n(4) Possible reductions of canopy LAI due to leaf fall\nA large increase in litterfall at the onset of the dry season has\nbeen well documented for the Manaus region (Klinge, 1968;\nLuizao and Schubart, 1987). If this increase in litterfall gives\nrise to a decrease in LAI, forest photosynthetic carbon up-\ntake during the dry season would naturally be expected to\ndecrease. To test this possibility, model runs were performed\nBiogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/\nL. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis 1259\nfor the dry season assuming a 10% and 20% decrease in total\nLAI, respectively (Nepstad et al., 2002; Asner et al., 2004).\nBut even in these cases, simulated GP overestimates the ob-\nservations (results not shown).\n3.2.4 Caxiuana\nFor this site a good model fit to observed mean diurnal cycle\nand light response of net carbon uptake for all seasons was\nobtained (Figs. 2\u20134). Simulated \u03b413C values are in within the\nhigher range of the reported values from this site (Table 7).\nFor this site, no DC bias to carbon uptake was obtained, al-\nthough there were fewer data points available here than for\nother sites (Man K34 and Jaru). However, in terms of energy\npartition, the model overestimates afternoon measurements\nduring all seasons, which could be linked to an insensitive\nstomatal conductance model to higher afternoon DC and air\ntemperatures.\n3.2.5 Tapajos\nThe sun\/shade model provided a good fit to the mean ob-\nserved diurnal cycle and light response of gross carbon up-\ntake for this site, (Figs. 2\u20134) but with a 10% underestima-\ntion in observed net carbon uptake during the rainy season.\nNotice the linear response of simulated photosynthesis at all\nlight levels. This is driven by the obtained parameterisation\nfor this site using the optimization procedure, (i.e. a high\nJmax\/Vmax ratio of 2.92, a very low quantum yield of 0.16\nand high \u03bb, compared to that obtained at the other sites).\nA combination of a very high Jmax\/Vmax ratio and low quan-\ntum yield of photosynthesis promotes light limitation of pho-\ntosynthesis in the model at most radiation values. Again, the\nmodel has a bias towards over predicting observations at the\nhighest values of DC and air temperature. Simulated \u03b413C is\non the higher end the observed range at this site (Table 7).\nAdditionally, under this parameterisation the model under\npredicts observed evaporative fraction in the early morning\nand late afternoon conditions.\n4 Scaling up to basin level\nAn attempt to produce a canopy scale function to scale up\nsimulations to basin level is also presented. Such scaling up\nis made based on the model calibration and evaluation for the\nfive tower sites. The scaling function can be used to param-\neterise the model at other sites, using the linear regression\nobtained from relating the best Vmax obtained from param-\neterisations at each of the 5 sites to its correspondent foliar\nN. Further, given that (1) tropical forest might be phosphorus\ninstead of nitrogen limited and (2) that phosphorus (P) plays\na regulatory role in the partition of the products of photosyn-\nthesis directly affecting the activity of the Calvin cycle and\ntherefore affecting the activity of Rubisco carboxylation, re-\nlationships between Vmax and foliar P, and the ratio of foliar\nN to foliar P are also explored.\nPhosphate limitation to photosynthesis may be linked to\na failure in the capacity of starch and sucrose synthesis to\nmatch the capacity of the production of triose phosphates in\nthe Calvin cycle, usually when both Ci and light are high.\nThe result is an inadequate rate of release of inorganic phos-\nphate in the chloroplast to recycle the P sequestered in the\nproduction of triose phosphates. In this case inorganic phos-\nphorus can limit photosynthesis (Harley and Sharkey,1991).\nThis has been included in the biochemistry of C3 photosyn-\nthesis (Collatz et al., 1991). Implementation of the TPU lim-\nitation to photosynthesis in the Collatz et al. (1991) model\nsuggests that the capacity of export or utilization of the prod-\nucts of photosynthesis is approximately equal to the maxi-\nmum photosynthetic uptake at saturating irradiance, defining\nthe TPU limitation as\nJs = Vmax\/2 (9)\nwhere Js is the export capacity or utilization of the photo-\nsynthetic products (most likely sucrose synthesis). Addition-\nally, several studies have shown P deficiency to reduce pho-\ntosynthesis (Terry and Ulrich, 1973; Sharkey, 1985; Brooks,\n1986; Jacob and Lawlor, 1992; Campbell and Sage, 2006).\nHowever, the mechanisms by which P deficiency affects pho-\ntosynthesis are not well understood (Campbell and Sage,\n2006). Other possible mechanisms by which P deficiency\naffects photosynthesis are via reductions in Rubisco activity\n(Brooks, 1986; Brooks et al., 1988), reductions in the rate of\nRuBP regeneration, reduction of quantum yield due to pho-\ntoinhibition caused by reduced efficiency of RuBP regener-\nation at low irradiances, and reductions in the Calvin cycle\nactivity due to reductions in key regulatory enzymes of the\ncycle (Brooks, 1986; Campbell and Sage, 2006). From the\nabove limited understanding on the mechanisms by which\nleaf phosphorus affects photosynthesis, we decided to relate\nVmax obtained in this study to leaf P for the 5 study sites.\nTwo methods were used to scale up to the basin level, one\nbased on leaf N and the other on leaf P. Linear relationships\nbetween mean leaf N (and leaf P) content per dry weight and\nper leaf area, using data outlined in Fyllas et al. (2009) were\nused, and best fitted Vmax at each site were used. However,\nbecause 8 (Eq. A6) affects to some extent the efficiency of\nVmax, to relate Vmax to leaf N and leaf P under the same con-\nditions, Vmax and Jmax\/Vmax were fitted again with a fixed\nquantum yield of 0.4, with results shown in Table 8.\nUsing this parameterisation for the sun\/shade model, sim-\nilar results are obtained at all sites compared to what was\nobtained except at Tapajos. At Tapajos, the model overesti-\nmated gross photosynthesis by 15% and 20% during the dry\nand wet season, respectively, with a better comparison to ob-\nserved evaporative fraction than obtained earlier (Fig. B3).\nThe reason for this overestimation is linked to a much higher\nquantum yield (0.4 vs. 0.16) and a much lower Jmax\/Vmax\nratio (1.88 vs. 2.96) than obtained in the site-specific simula-\ntions.\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009\n1260 L.

Additionally, relationships of Vmax in area and DW basis\nagainst leaf P and against the ratio of leaf N to leaf P are\nshown in Fig. 5 (bottom row) with associated statistics given\nin Table 9. The Vmax vs. Leaf P (DW and area basis) and\nVmax vs. leaf N\/leaf P predict increasing Vmax and both are\nstatistically significant.\n4.1 Model parameterization\nFigure 6 shows a comparison of top of the canopy Vmax ob-\ntained in this study (with quantum yield fixed to 0.4) against\navailable measurements (3 sites) and against Vmax calculated\nfrom linear regressions of Vmax against leaf N obtained from\nmeasurements at individual sites (available at 3 sites). The\nVmax values obtained (circles on Fig. 6) are on the upper end\nof the range, closest to the measured values at the 3 avail-\nable sites (crosses in Fig. 6). The large difference between\nVmax obtained in this study and those predicted from linear\nrelationships of Vmax and leaf N from other sites, are likely\ndue to the relationships reflecting specific conditions of the\nindividual sites. In any case, Vmax predicted from the regres-\nsion based on the Carswell et al. (2000) data is the lowest\nin Fig. 6. This is because leaf N from this data set are the\nhighest from all data sets considered here. Moreover, leaf N\nreported from Carswell et al. (2000) for Man C14 are also\nhigher than those measured at the same site by Ometto et\nal. (2006) and reported by Fyllas et al. (2009).\nThe quantum efficiency for CO2 fixation \u201cquantum yield\u201d,\nused in Eq. (A6) to estimate the irradiance absorbed by pho-\ntosystem II, was one of the parameters initially fitted at each\nsite. Farquhar et al. (1980) defined a theoretical upper limit\nto quantum yield (when f=0 in Eq. A6) in the absence of\noxygenation set by NADPH or by ATP requirement of 0.5\nand 0.4, respectively. Equation A6 an be rewritten using \u03b1,\nwhich intrinsically includes f and 8, this providing an alter-\nnative definition of the intrinsic quantum efficiency for CO2\nuptake. The form of Eq.

This shows that values obtained in this study\nare indeed within the published range of variation, with \u03b1\nfor Caxiuana close to the theoretical upper limit for quan-\ntum yield. According to Leuning (1990), when fitting \u03b1 and\ncurvature parameter \u03b8 (Eq. A5) to gas exchange measure-\nments, the obtained variation in \u03b1 has little physiological\nmeaning due to the interaction between \u03b1 and \u03b8 that occurs\nduring the non-linear curve fitting procedure. The curvature\nparameter \u03b8 has no mechanistic basis (Collatz et al., 1990),\nalthough it can be viewed as an indicator of the extent to\nwhich co-limitation (of light and Rubisco limitations) of pho-\ntosynthesis is present with \u03b8 approaching 1 meaning that co-\nlimitation is minimized. But a certain level of co-limitation\nis always present (Woodrow and Berry, 1988). Values of\n\u03b8 in some of the modelling studies (listed in Table 10), in-\nclude variations between 0.7 and 0.95. Moreover, a recent\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009\n1262 L. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis\nFig. 6. Top leaf Vmax.

Domingues et al. (2005) measured leaf\nphotosynthesis at the same Tapajos forest site as used in this\nstudy. They adopted a fixed 8 of 0.19 following Ehleringer\nand Bjo\u00a8rkman (1977) fitting light response measurements of\nphotosynthesis to a non-rectangular hyperbolic model. The\ncurvature factors derived from such a fitting exercise ranged\nbetween 0.45 and 0.9 for most of the cases.\nVariation in the parameterised value of 8 for the different\nsites of this study could thus simply be a result of a mathe-\nmatical interaction between 8 and \u03b8 (here fixed to 0.7). On\nthe other hand, as it was shown in Fig. B1, there do seem to\nbe real differences in the slope of the light response of mea-\nsured NE among sites which could have some physiological\nmeaning. For example, differences in efficiency of photosyn-\nthetic uptake due to nutrient or other stresses which, from the\nanalysis here not appear to be related to soil water deficits.\nDetailed measurements would be required to examine vari-\nation of 8 across sites. In summary, our fitting procedure\nproduced parameter values within the ranges derived from\ntheory, observation and values adopted by other modelling\nstudies.\n4.2 Data\nMoreover, model parameters obtained from this fitting ex-\nercise and the model evaluation presented in this study are\nsubject to the fidelity of the data used for model parame-\nterisation and evaluation. The main limitations to this data-\nmodel parameterisation and evaluation are associated with\ndifficulties in estimating ecosystem respiration and the lack\nof energy balance closure. Due to spatial and seasonal vari-\nability in soil respiration (Chambers et al., 2004; Silva de\nSouza, 2004), and with varying meteorological conditions\n(mainly precipitation regimes) during the measurement and\nmodel comparison periods, it is more than likely that there\nwere differences between the measured respiration and those\nwhich we used at 3 of the studied sites. Another source of\nuncertainty in the ecosystem respiration is associated with\nthe leaf respiration term. There is increasing evidence to\nshow that leaf respiration rates are lower when plants are\nphotosynthetically active (Brooks and Farquhar, 1985; Hoef-\nnagel et al., 1998; Atkin et al., 1998, 2000), especially at\nhigh leaf temperatures. Unfortunately, biochemical models\nof gas exchange do not yet include these effects and nei-\nther did the leaf level parameters used in this study for com-\nparisons against our obtained parameters. A recent study\n(Wohlfahrt et al., 2005) assessing daytime ecosystem respi-\nration in a mountain meadow found that a failure to include\nlight inhibition of canopy respiration resulted in an overesti-\nmation of daily estimates of ecosystem respiration and hence\ngross primary productivity from eddy correlation measure-\nments. Their results suggest a reduction in estimated GPP\nfrom eddy correlation measurements on the order of 11\u2013\n13% and 13\u201317% for a low and high estimate of the simu-\nlated maximum leaf-level reduction of dark respiration, re-\nspectively. Another study using eddy correlation data from\nvarious sites within Europe (Janssens et al., 2001) reports\nup to a 15% reduction in estimated total ecosystem respira-\ntion when considering daytime inhibition of leaf respiration.\nAn alternative method to refine estimates of ecosystem res-\npiration using eddy correlation measurements (Van Gorsel et\nal., 2007, 2008) is yet to be tested for the Amazon rainforest\nsites. The method uses the maximum of the sum of the tur-\nbulent flux and storage flux of CO2 in the early evening, and\nhas been shown to be in close agreement with measurements\nfrom soil and plant respiration chambers at a moderately\ncomplex tophography. Such maximum, which is unaffected\nby advection (Van Gorsel et al., 2008) due to stable stratifica-\ntion conditions after sunset, is used to construct relationships\nbetween night time ecosystem exchange measurements, soil\ntemperature and humidity which then can be used to predict\necosystem respiration at all times of day.\nFurthermore, there are considerable uncertainties in eddy\ncovariance measurements, especially above rain forest veg-\netation. For instance, there is a large sensitivity (10\u201325%\nannually) to the treatment of low frequencies and non-\nhorizontal flow and delay corrections and data spikes (Kruijt\net al., 2004). The total uncertainly in daytime measure-\nments estimated for the Manaus K34 and Jaru site are \u00b112\nand 32%, respectively (Kruijt et al., 2004). In addition to\nthese uncertainties in NE , the estimates of total ecosystem\nrespiration and use of modelled storage flux imposes an ad-\nditional uncertainty to the comparison presented. Further,\nnon-closure of the energy balance in the eddy covariance\ndata (Aubinet et al., 2002; Massman and Lee, 2002) forced\nus to consider only energy partition in terms of evaporative\nBiogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/\nL. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis 1263\nfraction. Due to the high hour-to-hour variability in the mea-\nsurements we also decided to test the model against mean\ndiurnal cycles only.\nIn order to close the energy balance, fluxes of carbon and\nenergy have been subject to different modes of data process-\ning and post processing correction at each site (Malhi et al.,\n2002; Finnigan et al., 2003; Gash and Dolman, 2003; van\nder Molen et al., 2004). With respect to linear detrending,\nand accounting for low frequency contributions and \u201cangle\nof attack dependent calibrations\u201d, in 2 out of 5 cases the en-\nergy balance improved with the magnitude of the CO2 fluxes\nincreasing as well (Malhi et al., 2002; von Randow et al.,\n2004). In general, non-closure of the energy balance at four\nof the five sites implies a missing CO2 which may have con-\ntributed to the model\/data mismatch. However, the extent to\nwhich this has occurred is unknown. After recalibration of\nfluxes for angle of attack and low frequency contributions,\nthe energy and carbon fluxes increased (compared to data\nwithout this calibration) (Gash and Dolman, 2003; van der\nMolen et al., 2004). However, the level of improvement in\npercentage closure of energy fluxes differs from those im-\nprovements for carbon fluxes. Furthermore, A. Arau\u00b4jo (per-\nsonal communication, 2004) obtained an increase of 8% on\naverage for sensible, latent and CO2 fluxes after recalculat-\ning the fluxes including the angle of attack correction for the\nMan K34 site.\nHigher rates of litterfall towards the end of the wet sea-\nson\/onset of dry season are well documented for some sites\nin the Amazon region (Klinge, 1968; Luizao and Schubart,\n1987; Nepstad et al., 2002; Goulden et al., 2004). How-\never the expected concurrent decrease in LAI has still not\nbeen measured. The phenology behind this phenomenon still\nneeds better understanding. Besides satellite derived LAI, in\nsitu measurements of seasonality in LAI are very scarce for\nthe Amazon region. Nevertheless, according to Doughty and\nGoulden (2008a), in situ LAI seasonality is actually oppo-\nsite to that derived from satellite measurements. Lacking in\nsitu measurements for most sites, LAI seasonality was not\nincluded in any of the sites unless there were available LAI\ndata (used only at the Caxiuana site). Seasonality in LAI\nmay play a major role in driving seasonality of gross uptake\nat Caxiuana and Tapajos (Carswell et al. 2002; Goulden et\nal., 2004). A recent study using field work observations at\none of the rainforest Tapajos sites (Doughty and Goulden,\n2008a) reports that measured seasonality of GPP at this site\ncould only be explained when taking into account, seasonal\nchanges in (i) LAI, (ii) leaf age and (iii) leaf photosynthesis.\nAnother study, measuring leaf level photosynthesis at a well\ndrained and droughted forest at Caxiuana, during various\ndry and wet periods, concluded that the observed seasonal-\nity in maximum rates of photosynthesis at both well drained\nand droughted forest was not accompanied by any significant\nchange in the photosynthetic parameters Vmax, RD , Jmax, in\nmost species, suggesting that the inhibition observed in CO2\ncarbon uptake in the dry season was mostly dictated by stom-\natal closure (Vale et al., 2003). More experiments of this type\nare needed at different sites across the Amazon basin to un-\nderstand the main factors controlling seasonality in carbon\nand water exchange at the different sites.\n4.3 Model evaluation\nModel bias towards overestimation of measured carbon up-\ntake at high DC and temperature was usually linked to mid-\nday and afternoon values, the exceptions being Man C14 and\nCaxiuana. This indicates a model insensitivity to stomatal\nclosure under these conditions. However, the observed de-\ncrease in CO2 uptake at high DC and air temperatures may\nnot be caused by plant water stress per se because at least for\nthe period studied, the original investigators have indicated\nthat there were no indications of soil water stress at Tapa-\njos (da Rocha et al., 2004; Goulden et al., 2004; Saleska et\nal., 2003) and at Jaru (von Randow et al., 2004). Manaus\nK34 was studied here only during the wet and end of dry\nperiods. Furthermore, Mercado (2007) compared the perfor-\nmance of the model used here (also coupled to the sun and\nshade model) against two versions of the Ball and Berry (Ball\net al., 1987) stomatal conductance model. The first version\nis the modified scheme by Leuning (1990) with dependence\non relative humidity, and second version included a depen-\ndence on DC as modified by Leuning (Leuning, 1995). Both\nstomatal conductance models were coupled to the sun and\nshade model. Using the \u201cBall and Berry\u201d or the \u201cLambda\u201d\nmodel made no major difference to the simulated carbon up-\ntake or to the quality of the residuals with either photosynthe-\nsis model. Lloyd et al. (1995) obtained similar results when\ncomparing the same two stomatal conductance models cou-\npled to a big leaf model at the Jaru site. This was not unex-\npected because theoretically both models embody the same\nprinciples. They incorporate the well known correlations be-\ntween photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and describe\nGs using similar variables (i.e. DC or relative humidity at the\nleaf surface, CO2 uptake, and CO2 concentration at the leaf\nsurface). Finally, Tuzet et al. (2003) suggest that model in-\nsensitivity to afternoon conditions (high DC and air tempera-\ntures) may result from inadequate\/or in this case no coupling\nof stomatal conductance to the dynamics of water transport\nfrom soil to the roots and leaves. This may suggest the need\nfor a stomatal conductance formulation that includes stom-\natal regulation taking into account both the external environ-\nment (demand) but also the dynamics of water movement\nfrom the soil\/root to the leaf (supply) (Tyree, 2003; Buck-\nley, 2005; Fisher et al., 2007). From soil moisture measure-\nments at a neighboring site to that studied here at Tapajos, da\nRocha et al. (2004) found night time water recharge and day\ntime water withdrawal from roots down to 60 cm up to the\ntop 5 cm during dry and wet periods, with soil at 2 m depth\nremaining moist all year round implying full access to soil\nwater throughout the dry season.\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009\n1264 L. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis\nAnother explanation for the model mismatch at high tem-\nperature and DC conditions could be linked to decrease in\nforest photosynthesis due to high temperatures. Doughty\nand Goulden (2008b) measured leaf level canopy temper-\natures in parallel with canopy and leaf level photosynthe-\nsis and evaporation. From their observations, these authors\nsuggest that the forest (neighbor to the Tapajos km 67 stud-\nied here) appears to be close to a high temperature thresh-\nold above which photosynthesis declines. However, Lloyd\nand Farquhar (2008) using observations, model parameteri-\nzations of leaf level photosynthesis with known temperature\nsensitivities, and climate model output conclude that there\nis no evidence for tropical forest being close to a tempera-\nture threshold or to the upper temperature limit for optimum\nphotosynthesis. Their model suggests decreases in photo-\nsynthesis above 30\u25e6C, which the authors explain as a stom-\natal conductance response to high DC . The simulations pre-\nsented in this study used a value of 39\u25e6C as the maximum\noptimum temperature dependency of electron transport rate,\nobtained fitting eddy correlation measurements to the sun and\nshade model at the Manaus C14 site (Mercado et al., 2006).\nLloyd et al. (1995) obtained a value of 43\u25e6C when fitting\na big leaf model to eddy correlation measurements at the Jaru\nsite. More measurements of leaf level temperature response\nat different rainforest sites is needed to check if tempera-\nture threshold measured at Tapajos (Doughty and Goulden,\n2008b) prevails elsewhere. Finally, another possible expla-\nnation for the decline in photosynthesis and stomatal closure\nat high DC and temperature conditions might be related to\na reduction in the activation state of Rubisco due to the high\ntemperature being above its thermal optimum (Sage and Ku-\nbien, 2007). If this was the case, the capacity of deactivated\nRubisco would be needed to be incorporated into the photo-\nsynthesis models.\nThe underestimation of simulated latent heat fluxes dur-\ning the rainy season at 3 of 5 sites could mean the model\nneeds larger simulated stomatal conductances to account for\nthe observations. For instance, the best simulated energy par-\ntitioning was obtained when the fit for carbon uptake was on\nthe upper range (Table 5). This was the case for end of dry\nand dry seasons at Manaus C14, end of dry season at Manaus\nK34 and the dry season in Jaru. On the other hand, when the\nfit for carbon uptake was on the lower range there was usu-\nally a model tendency to underestimate the mean observed\ndiurnal cycle of evaporative fraction. This was the case dur-\ning all seasons at Caxiuana, Tapajos and rainy seasons at\nManaus C14 and K34 and rainy season at Jaru. Furthermore,\nat Tapajos, after refitting with a fixed quantum yield of 0.4,\nthe fit for carbon uptake was overestimated observations by\n20 and 15% during the rainy and wet seasons, respectively,\nwhilst obtaining a better fit to evaporative fraction (Fig. B3).\nFurthermore, a larger simulated stomatal conductance\ncould be obtained either by increasing the \u03bb parameter from\nthe stomatal conductance model or by increasing the simu-\nlated assimilation rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that by\nincreasing \u03bb, the Ci\/Ca ratio increased and therefore the\nsimulated \u03b413C decreased (becoming more negative). In gen-\neral, this led to model underestimation of \u03b413C. The second\noption would be to increase simulated GP which automati-\ncally would lead to model overestimation with respect to the\nobservations. However, associated with a failure to close the\nenergy balance is a probably also a non-measured CO2 flux\nsignal (Aranibar et al., 2006), implying a higherGP than cur-\nrently measured. A consequence of a higher simulated GP\nis a concurrent increase in simulated latent heat fluxes which\nwould improve the model comparison to evaporative fraction\nmeasurements.\nGenerally, besides the DC bias towards overestimation\n(found at 3 of 5 sites), the sun and shade model performed\nwell in simulating the carbon uptake at all tower sites, a find-\ning supported by the \u03b413C evaluation, with a model tendency\nto underestimate energy partition at some sites during the\nrainy season. Morales et al. (2005) evaluated 4 process-based\nmodels against eddy correlation flux data at 15 European\nsites and found no single model performed well for both car-\nbon and water fluxes. According to Morales et al. (2005),\ntwo models performed better at simulating carbon fluxes, the\nremaining two models in simulating water fluxes. Another\nmodelling study using the land surface scheme of the Hadley\nCentre GCM carried out an evaluation with the same data set\nas used here for the Man K34 site, and obtained better results\nfor carbon uptake than for energy partition (Mercado et al.,\n2007).\n4.4 Scaling up to basin level\nUnfortunately there were only five data points to derive rela-\ntionships between Vmax and leaf N and leaf P, and the slope\nand high correlation coefficient for the correlations between\nVmax and leaf P (in area and DW basis) is due to a one data\npoint which has the highest leaf P in the data set, correspond-\ning to the Jaru site. However, the linear relationships of Vmax\nagainst leaf P (in area basis) from this study are comparable\nto those from leaf level measurements from tropical forest in\nWest Africa with more fertile soil types (Domingues, unpub-\nlished data) (Fig. 7).\nThese results suggest the possibility that foliar P or the\nratio of Foliar N to P may emerge as good predictors for the\nphotosynthetic capacity for Amazonian forests. This needs to\nbe verified by field observations and unfortunately, the eddy\ncorrelation systems have yet to be installed at sites where leaf\nphosphorus concentrations are higher than at the five Brazil-\nian sites used here, all of which were on relatively infertile\nsoils. This is important, because Fyllas et al. (2009) substan-\ntially higher average foliar P for sites in western Amazonia\nsuch as in South Peru and Ecuador, than the current Brazilian\nsites used in this study.\nBiogeosciences, 6, 1247\u20131272, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/1247\/2009\/\nL. M. Mercado et al.: Modelling Amazon forest canopy photosynthesis 1265\nFig. 7. Linear relationships obtained in this study (in circles) and\nobtained from tropical forest in Africa (in squares, Domingues, un-\npublished data).\n5 Summary\nUsing a sun and shade model, the carbon uptake at 5 rainfor-\nest sites in the Brazilian Amazon was relatively well simu-\nlated. This result is supported by the ability of the model to\nreproduce values of \u03b413C discrimination, although this was\nobtained with a poor partition of energy at some sites, mainly\nfor wet season measurements. Additionally, the sun and\nshade model coupled to a model for stomatal conductance\nbased on that of Cowan and Farquhar (1977) was unable\nto accurately capture carbon and energy fluxes at high DC ,\nover predicting measurements. There is still a need to under-\nstand the physiology of the stomatal closure under the after-\nnoon conditions in these forests before it can be modelled.\nNevertheless, a stomatal conductance description including\nhydraulic supply and demand might improve the model re-\nsponse under such conditions (Buckley, 2005).\nMajor constraints to model-data evaluation exercises such\nas attempted here are, however, imposed by the uncertainty\nin estimates of ecosystem respiration, mainly due to the sea-\nsonality of soil respiration, but also CO2 storage fluxes and\nuncertainties associated with measurements from the eddy\ncorrelation NE and non-closure of the energy balance.\nFinally we note that this modelling exercise can be used\nto extrapolate simulations to the basin level. We have devel-\noped empirical relations between best fits of Vmax and foliar\nN and P concentrations that can be tested to scale up to the\nbasin level. Furthermore, the relationship between of Vmax\nand P suggests the possibility of foliar P, or maybe N\/P ra-\ntio a better predictor for canopy photosynthetic capacity than\nonly foliar N in these forests. And given that most sites in\nwestern amazon have higher average foliar P (Fyllas et al.,\n2009), this might imply a gradient of GPP across Amazo-\nnia with higher GPP where leaf P is highest. Implications of\nthese relationships will be explored further in an accompany-\ning paper (Mercado et al., 2009) investigating the sensitivity\nof GPP to Vmax parameterised using leaf P and leaf N at 35\nsites across the Amazon Basin.\nResults from this study highlight the need for field studies\nto further investigate the relationship between photosynthesis\nand leaf phosphorus in Amazonian forests.\nAppendix A\nEquations for canopy photosynthesis using the sun\nand shade model from de Pury and Farquhar (1997)\nFollowing de Pury and Farquhar (1997), canopy level pho-\ntosynthetic capacity is calculated as the integral of leaf pho-\ntosynthetic capacity over the entire canopy, as parameterised\nwith leaf level data for the Manaus Cl4 site in Mercado et\nal. (2006):\nVmax canopy =\nLAI\u222b\n0\nVmax leafdl (A1)\nVmax canopy = Vmax top\n[\n1\u2212 exp(\u2212kn)\n]\n\/kn (A2)\nwhere Vmax leaf is the maximum carboxylation activity of\nRubisco at the leaf level in area basis, Vmax canopy is the\ncanopy level value for Vmax, Vmax top, is the Vmax value for\ntop leaves. The cumulative leaf area index from the top of\nthe canopy down to any level in the canopy is l, LAI is the\ntotal canopy leaf area index and kn is a nitrogen or Vmax allo-\ncation coefficient, defining the vertical decrease of Vmax leaf\nwith cumulative leaf area within the canopy.\nPhotosynthetic capacity of the sunlit and shaded fractions\nof the canopy is calculated by integrating the leaf photosyn-\nthetic capacity and the sunlit and shaded leaf area fractions,\nrespectively. Photosynthesis of the sunlit and shaded frac-\ntions is then calculated separately using the leaf level bio-\nchemistry model of Farquhar and Caemmerer (1982), as two\nbig leaves, with the absorbed irradiance and photosynthetic\ncapacity, light saturated rate of electron transport and leaf\ndark respiration of each fraction used instead of the equiv-\nalent leaf level variables. Finally canopy photosynthesis is\ncalculated by adding the individual contributions from the\nsunlit and shaded photosynthesis.\nA1 Leaf biochemistry\nThe CO2 assimilation rate (A) in units (\u00b5mol m2 s\u22121) is con-\ntrolled by the rate of carboxylation when Rubisco activity\nis limiting (Av) at low intercellular partial pressure of CO2\nand\/or at high irradiances, and by the rate of electron transfer\nwhen Ribulose bisphospate (RuBP) regeneration is limiting\n(AJ ) at high intercellular partial pressure of CO2 and\/or at\nlow irradiances. The rate of CO2 assimilation is modelled\nas the minimum of Av and AJ .
