Analysis of experimental data shows that AFAIs in the polar ionosphere are generated under different background geophysical conditions (season, local time, the presence of sporadic layers in the E region, etc.). It is shown that AFAIs can be excited not only in the F region, but also in \u201cthick\u201d sporadic E s layers of the polar ionosphere. The AFAIs were observed in some cycles of heating when the HF heater frequency exceeded the critical frequency by 0.3\u20130.5 MHz. Propagation paths of diagnostic HF radio waves scattered by AFAIs were modelled for geophysical conditions prevailing during the SPEAR heating experiments. Two components, namely, a narrow-banded one with a Doppler-spectrum width of up to 2 Hz and a broadband one observed in a band of up to 20 Hz, were found in the sporadic E s layer during the AFAI excitation. Analysis of the SEE spectra shows that the behavior of the DM component in time is irregular, which is possibly due to strong variations in the critical frequency of the F 2 layer from 3.5 to 4.6 MHz. An interesting feature observed in the SPEAR heating experiments is that the generation of the DM component was similar to the excitation of AFAIs when the heater frequency was up to 0.5 MHz higher than the critical frequency","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Springer Verlag","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8168<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2012-07-25T13:05:04Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_1<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_10633<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nThe polar-ionosphere phenomena induced by high-power radio waves from the spear heating facility<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nBlagoveshchenskaya, N.F.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBorisova, T.D.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKornienko, V.A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nJanzhura, A.S.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKalishin, A.S.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRobinson, T.R.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nYeoman, Tim K.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWright, D.M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBaddeley, L.J.<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics, 2008, 51 (11), pp. 847-857.
