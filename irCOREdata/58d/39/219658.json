These strategies include pointing out discursive Orientalisms, \ndeconstructing historical myths of European development, challenging \nEurocentric historiographies, re-articulating subaltern subjectivities,  \ndiversifying political subjecthoods, and re-imagining the social-\npsychological subject of world politics. The value of articulating the \nproject in this way is illustrated in relation to a specific research project on \nthe politics of the liberal peace in Mozambique. The paper discusses a \nnumber of tensions arising from engaging with plurality and difference \nas a basis for conducting social inquiry, as well as some structural \nproblems in the profession that inhibit carrying out this kind of research.  \n \n \nKeywords: postcolonialism; decolonisation; Eurocentrism; liberal peace \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe academic enterprise requires that we make our arguments in \nconversation with existing work and ideas. As such it is an inherently social \nactivity \u2013 indeed we might consider conversation a constitutive element of \nacademic life.The move to thinking about IR\u2019s conversations as a set of \n\u2018dialogues\u2019 rather than \u2018debates\u2019, as Millennium's conference has encouraged, \nis both in keeping with the traditions of the study of world politics and \nsubversive of the order that has historically shielded the conversation from \nintruders. The notion of 'dialogue', taken etymologically, is about speaking (-\nlogos) across or through (dia-), suggesting distance and difference between \n                                                 \n1 This research is supported by ESRC Studentship ES\/F005431\/1. I am also grateful for helpful \ncomments from participants at the Millennium Conference, members of the LSE IR \nDepartment\u2019s International Theory seminar and members of the LSE Global Governance \nlunchtime seminar.

It requires that we ask questions about their identities, horizons \nand interests, and indeed how these are situated within the world of practice \nand action, rather than presuming homogeneity of interest and a common \npurpose to inquiry. We are pushed towards understanding academic work as \na live enterprise, disorderly and dynamic in form, embedded in a world of \nplurality. \n \nAnd yet, despite engaging in the conversational practices all the time \nthat constitute the practice of academic work, the mainstream has been slow \nto pick up the emergence of a movement in the discipline that extends \ndialogue itself as a critical strategy for thinking about the world.2 As this \npaper aims to show, self-consciously decolonising strategies aim to articulate \ndifferent subject-positions from which this 'speaking across' or 'dialogue' can \ntake place. In doing so they bring to prominence a principle that is already \ntaken for granted in everyday academic practice \u2013 that understanding is \nimproved through dialogue \u2013 and use it to generate a wider and more critical \nunderstanding of what we think of as international relations.3 Although \nnecessarily rooted in common traditions of social thought, decolonising \nstrategies aim at reconfiguring our understanding of world politics through \nsubjecting its main perspectives to philosophical and empirical challenges. \nThis project sees itself as broadly rooted in a progressive ethic, motivated by \nthe desire to see and understand world order in a way appropriate to the \nrealisation of more equal relations between and within diverse political \ncommunities.4   \n \n                                                 \n2 Recent texts include Inayatullah, N. and D.

See Hutchings, K. (2005). \"Speaking and hearing: \nHabermasian discourse ethics, feminism and IR.\" Review of International Studies 31(01): 155-\n165. \n4 The role of normative evaluation in social analysis is a controversial issue. I am broadly \nsympathetic to the position articulated by Mervyn Frost, who sees normative judgements as \nrelevant at all stages of analysis, and argues for making them more explicit. See  Frost, M. \n(1994). \"The Role of Normative Theory in IR.\" Millennium - Journal of International Studies \n23(1): 109-118.  \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 3 \nThis paper aims to develop conversations within IR about the \ncontribution of decolonising strategies. The overall argument is that \ndecolonising thought can be viewed as a set of distinct but connected \nintellectual strategies that provide a productive platform for identifying \nspecific problems in our research into world politics.  Firstly, I will read \ndecolonising strategies as problematising the embedded \u2018subjects\u2019 of world \npolitics in various ways and offer a heuristic typology of this wide research \nprogramme along these lines.  Secondly,  I will demonstrate the contribution \nof this critical move through applying these distinctive strategies to the \n'liberal peace' debate in IR and the case of Mozambique.  Finally, I will offer \nsome reflections about the questions this raises for the future study of world \npolitics, both through building theory and research practices. \n \nThe paper seeks to make contributions to the literature on a number of \nfronts. Primarily, in offering an innovative typology of decolonising strategies \nit sets up a useful framework for debate about and between different \n\u2018postcolonial\u2019 or \u2018anti-Eurocentric\u2019 approaches in the study of world politics. \nIn particular, it enables the detailed comparison of complementarities and \ntensions in decolonising thought through indicating how and why \napproaches differ and what their specific concerns are. However, the corollary \ncontribution is that it also offers a unique mirror to the discipline of IR \nthrough articulating different ways in which its framings might be \nproblematic in a supposedly postcolonial era. The contribution of the case \nstudy is a demonstration of the ways in which the typology supports a \ndevelopment of applied critical approaches in IR, which all too often attempt \nto critique international political power without disturbing some important \nunderlying assumptions. It demonstrates that these specific decolonising \nstrategies as articulated by the typology can be usefully concretised and \napplied to specific sites and topics of interest.  It also makes a case for how \nand why appropriate empirical research is a crucial part of an active \ndecolonising project, whilst highlighting the precariousness of the support \nthat the profession offers for this. \n \n \nTheory as strategy: recovering the purposes of critique \n \n If \u2018theory is always for someone and some purpose\u2019, we should think \nabout it as a form of intellectual strategy, i.e. a response to a particular set of \nconditions, involving different tactics employed towards a particular end. In \nthis sense, the philosophical wagers and commitments made are located in \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 4 \nand directed towards a particular problem, and express different interests.5 \nThis is as true for a conception of the international derived from a statist and \nmaterialist ontology of power as it is for feminist excavations of the \ninternational structures of patriarchy or concepts of globalisation. \n \nThis now commonplace observation has at least three important \nimplications for how we assess and think about theories of the international. \nFirstly, it suggests that an important aspect of evaluating theory needs to be \ndone in the context of its own purposes. This may not seem controversial to \nmany academics, and particularly not the readership of Millennium, but given \nthe persistence of \u2018science\u2019 controversies in the broader discipline it needs to \nbe borne in mind.6 Theories are not the \u2018last word\u2019 on phenomena, but \nanalytic lenses that structure our thinking to a particular end. Secondly, \nhowever, it must mean that it is at least useful, but also legitimate and \nnecessary to engage with, discuss and challenge the purposes of work and its \ncontext rather than assume that this stands outside or apart from the \nendeavour. This does not preclude the possibility of reasonable disagreement \nabout these objectives, but it does preclude the denial of their relevance.7   \n \nThirdly, and perhaps most crucially however, it also draws attention to \nthe necessarily limited and incomplete nature of our conceptual endeavours. \nThese are not shortcomings of our work but its constitutive features \u2013 it is \ngrounded in a particular conceptual vocabulary or register, and has a \nparticular focus or target. As such, when thinking about how we analyse \ncomplex social phenomena, such as patriarchy, political violence or racism, \ngiven a wide acceptance that these are manifested and can be explained at \nvarious levels, no single mode of analysis is likely to be completely \nsatisfactory.    \n \nIn drawing together the connections in this literature, it makes sense to \nread the contributions as \u2018decolonising strategies\u2019 for thinking about world \npolitics rather than as \u2018theory\u2019 as IR has conventionally tried to understand it \n\u2013 these are critical intellectual strategies designed to challenge the centrality of \nparticular ideas about the international which naturalise forms of historic \ninequality between communities and people. In particular, these are \nconnected to the legacies, broadly understood, of European colonialism and \nthe hierarchies of power, wealth and regard that it sought to institute.  \n                                                 \n5 In future work I intend to deal more fully with the essentially situated character of \ndecolonising critiques. The link between anti-colonial thought and philosophical pragmatism \nis found in the work of Cornel West \u2013 I am grateful to Joe Hoover for pointing this out. \n6 Jackson narrates these controversies well in the first chapter of Jackson, P. T. (2010). The \nConduct of Inquiry in International Relations. London, Routledge. \n7 Frost, op.cit., 118. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 5 \n \nWhy do we need a typology?  \n \n  To this author at least, there is a clear sense in which the decolonising \nproject in IR has been blossoming in recent years. The publication of \ngroundbreaking monographs has been complemented by more edited \ncollections, mainstream journal articles, conference panels and entire \nconferences, postgraduate courses and now textbooks.8  In this period, the \nprincipal aims and concerns of the project have been articulated in divergent \nways by different authors, which has contributed to the flourishing of the \nresearch programme. However, it also raises important questions about the \nrelationship between these different articulations.  For example, Inayatullah \nand Blaney have foregrounded the \u2018difference\u2019 problematic as central to their \nproject, concentrating on the Self\/Other encounter that constitutes the space of \nthe international.9 This project suggests a focus on the production of alterity \nand the question of respect. On the other hand, Jones articulates the project as \na common preoccupation with the persistence of colonial and imperial \nrelations within the international system, with an emphasis on discovering \nthe Eurocentric and imperial constitution of international relations in the \npresent day.10 As she notes, debates about Eurocentrism can often divide into \nculturalist and political economy camps which talk past each other.11 \n \nWhilst valuable, this richness also brings the potential for opacity. As \nBhambra notes, following Wallerstein, the notion of \u2018Eurocentrism\u2019 is itself \ncontested and can mean different things.12 Whilst this does not mean that it \ncannot be a useful frame of analysis, it does mean that usages might be \ninterchanged or conflated in a number of ways. For example, for Hobson, \nEurocentrism is  \n \nthe assumption that the West lies at the centre of all things in the world \nand that the West self-generates through its own endogenous \u2018logic of \nimmanence\u2019, before projecting its global will-to-power outwards through \na one-way diffusionism so as to remake the world in its own image.13 \n                                                 \n8 E.g.

(2007). \"Is critical theory always for the white West and for Western \nimperialism? Beyond Westphilian towards a post-racist critical IR.\" Review of International \nStudies 33(S1): 91-116, 93.  \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 6 \n \nHobson\u2019s conception suggests that Eurocentrism simultaneously \ncontains certain historical, sociological and political claims, which brings to \nthe fore how these may be inter-related. However, as Bhambra notes, it may \nbe possible for work to explicitly reject some aspects whilst retaining others.14 \nMoreover, in some of the literature the \u2018Eurocentrism\u2019 problematic can drop \nout altogether, particularly that concerned most principally with \ncontemporary US \/ North American power.15 \n \nYet, even with this diversity, I want to argue that there is a common \nframework that unites the project, recognition of which might serve as a \nplatform for dialogue between its elements and with those working outside it. \nThis is the claim that IR is constructed around the exclusionary premise of an \nimagined Western subject of world politics.16 Decolonising strategies are those \nthat problematize this claim and offer alternative accounts of subjecthood as \nthe basis for inquiry. The recognition of possible alternative subjects of \ninquiry is the essential precondition for a dialogic mode of inquiry in IR \u2013 that \nis, speaking across divides from different positions. Conversely, without \nchallenging the implicit and assumed universality of a particular subject, the \npossibility for genuine dialogue \u2013 rather than simply conversation \u2013 in the \ndiscipline becomes remote. \n \n \nA typology of strategies: challenging the \u2018subjects\u2019 of IR \n \nIn social theory, the \u2018subject\u2019 of inquiry has multiple but related \ndefinitions.17  I am using these different meanings in a non-exhaustive and \nheuristic sense to delve into the structure of thinking behind decolonising \nstrategies (numbered i-vi in the text). I summarise these here before \nelaborating in more depth in the rest of this section. In the first sense, various \napproaches focus on the construction of the West as an epistemically \nprivileged or centred subject that can represent, know and treat parts of the \nworld as its objects,  through processes of objectification. In the second sense, \n                                                 \n14 Bhambra, op.cit. \n15 In particular, Agathangelou, A. M. and L. H. M. Ling (2009), op.cit. \n16 This framing emerges in a limited way in the debates around subaltern historiography, but \nis not extended in consideration of other decolonising strategies as far as I know e.g. \nO'Hanlon, R. (1988). \"Recovering the subject: Subaltern Studies and histories of resistance in \ncolonial South Asia.\" Modern Asian Studies 22(1): 189-224. \n17 For explicitly disaggregating different uses of the term \u2018subject\u2019 in social theory, I am \nindebted to Paul Kirby\u2019s unpublished paper \u2018The System Of Subjects: International Relations \nTheory and the Hard Problem of Subjectivity\u2019 , International Theory seminar at the LSE\u2019s IR \nDepartment, 23rd November 2009, although his usages are not mine. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 7 \nthere is a strategy to challenge the exceptionalist presumption of the West as \nthe primary subject of modern world history and international relations. \nThirdly, a number of approaches challenge Europe as the implicit subject of \nhistoriography. Fourthly, various works reconstruct the subjectivities of \nsubaltern positions. Fifthly, there is a tradition which interrogates the \npresumed contours of the political subject underpinning analysis. Finally, \ndecolonising work in IR has sought to challenge the constitution of the social-\npsychological subject underpinning recent work which anthropomorphises \nstates as reflexive beings. \n \nUnderstood in this way, at a broad level decolonising strategies argue \nthat IR sees the world through the subjecthood(s),18 in all the senses just \ndescribed, of formerly colonial and imperial European and American \nmodernist, capitalist elites.  This is understood to constitute a system of \nmultiple exclusions that continues to permeate the study and conduct of \nworld politics, which subsequently retains deeply hierarchical forms oriented \ntowards the interests and perspectives of this particular audience. However, \nas a response decolonising strategies do not on the whole advocate a \nsystematic erasure or denial of these categories \u2013 rather they have attempted \nto expose the alternatives and initiate dialogue between them. In this sense \nthey seek to re-negotiate the terms and preoccupations of inquiry, a point to \nwhich I will return in the conclusion.19 \n \nThe first strategy (i) centres on exposing the ways in which the \nconceptual framings of both International Relations and international politics \nexpress and reinforce hierarchical subject-object relationships between \nformerly colonising and colonised peoples, despite the political-legal act of \ndecolonisation. Drawing directly on Said\u2019s critique of colonial practices of \n                                                 \n18 I owe use of the term to Robbie Shilliam.  \n19 A point which at the time of writing must be temporarily shelved is the ongoing tensions \nand overlaps between the decolonising project and the historical materialist project. Whilst \nthey are in some ways inseparable, for this author the key fundamental difference arises in \nthe possibility of a socially meaningful alterity that is not sidelined analytically as a form of \nfalse consciousness, incomplete modernity or underdevelopment; in short, the debate over \nthe significance of pluralities of experience and standpoints in the analysis of human affairs. \nDecolonising approaches on the whole are broadly sympathetic to, and often use, arguments \nin terms of social forces and the material conditions of political power and change; however \nthere is discomfort with the potentially reductive implications of such a view for human \nsubjectivity and political subjecthood in the extrapolation to the \u2018objective\u2019 understanding of \nworld history. However, this is a very general statement and it is clear that there are broad \nchurches of thought within the various camps self-identifying as \u2018Marxist\u2019 or \u2018decolonising \/ \npostcolonialist\u2019, who have varying approaches to this relationship between selves and social \nforces.

For example, Doty analyses historical \nand contemporary framings of North-South relations, from colonialism to \ngovernance to foreign aid in terms of the persistence of the imperial structure \nof the discourse that produces the relationship.21 Antony Anghie argues that \nthe concept of \u2018good governance\u2019 is historically continuous with international \nlegal norms that established rights and duties for colonial powers to rule the \ncolonies, operating under ideas of racialised civilisational hierarchies.22 Both \nwriters, amongst others, point towards the ways in which the ways that the \nglobal South \u2013 that is to say, spaces outside Europe and North America \u2013 \nbecome objectified in discourse as requiring external control, involvement and \ndirection \u2013 in Said\u2019s term that they \u2018beseech domination\u2019.23 In a substantive \nsense this means that formerly colonised countries become understood \nthrough being fixed as the object of some other subject which instrumentalises \nit or treats it as lacking proper agency.24 Under conditions of objectification, \nthen, the possibility of dialogue becomes remote.   \n \nWithin the discipline of IR itself, there has been solid critique of Robert \nJackson\u2019s analysis of \u2018quasi-states\u2019 along similar lines, which obliquely \nrenders the third world as a cracked or incomplete image of the first.25 The \nvarious objectifying representations of the South as backward, developing, \nfailed or \u2018new\u2019 states continually reproduce the hierarchical self imagery that \nunderpinned European colonialism, and specifically produces a disposition \nthat favours intervention and control between the full subjects and lesser \nobjects of world politics. The critique that decolonising thought makes is that \nwhilst the formal political and legal acts of decolonisation have broadly \noccurred, the deeper challenge to the colonial system of thinking \u2013 of \nobjectifying the South in discourses of world politics \u2013 has not happened. The \nstrategy in this case is to raise consciousness about the ways in which our \n                                                 \n20 Said, E. W. (2003). Orientalism.

As Anghie recognises, this strategy must \nwork alongside others which recover another telling of this encounter in order \nto challenge these discourses as not just hegemonic but essentially fictive \nrhetorical devices.26 Insofar as these strategies work within a framework \nwhereby the discourses of the powerful are the primary object of analysis, \nthey have tended to do the latter understandably in only a secondary or \nlimited sense. Nonetheless, this groundwork is clearly critical in clearing the \nspace for alternative discourses and speakers, and the possibility of dialogue \nwhich is precluded by Orientalist objectifications. \n \nThe second approach is a deconstruction of the West as the primary \nsubject of world history. This wider approach develops into two distinct \nstrategies. The first (ii) involves the direct contradiction of foundational \nhistorical myths in social theory and discourse about Europe itself \u2013 i.e. that it \nwas technologically advanced, economically developed, that it advanced the \nproblems of international coexistence through the institutionalisation of state \nsovereignty, that it was the origin of enlightened and universalist ethical and \npolitical thought.  These strands have generally had their heritage in historical \nsociology, political economy and revisionist readings of political thought.27 \nOverall they have sought to contradict or subvert the correlation of Europe \nwith pioneering a progressive modernity. John Hobson for example argues \nthat historically in the encounter between West and East it was the West that \nwas considered backward in terms of technology and social structures, and \nwas only able to flourish as the consequence of being a \u2018late developer\u2019.28 \nSandra Halperin argues that the mythologisation of European development, \nand in particular the various \u2018revolutions\u2019 that were instantiated, obscures the \nfact that European growth and expansion was predicated on the \u2018dualistic\u2019 \neconomy, with its violences and exclusions, that the Third World is currently \n                                                 \n26 Anghie, op cit. .However, there is disquiet amongst thinkers about the extent to which \npostcolonial literature has been constrained by the postmodern \/ poststructuralist  tenor of its \napproaches, and the commitment to \u2018real\u2019 lives. See Appiah, K. A. (1991). \"Is the post-in \npostmodernism the post-in postcolonial?\" Critical Inquiry: 336-357 for one such discussion. \n27 Under my reading decolonising strategies are themselves heterodox in scope and origins, \ninclusive of aspects of other traditions as well as work which self-identifies as \u2018postcolonial\u2019. \n28 Hobson, J.

This is important to the decolonising project \ninsofar as the implicit particular history of exceptionalism and enlightenment \noften serves to legitimate various forms of control and authority in the present \nday. By pushing beyond the \u2018winner\/loser\u2019 account of world history31 it is \nargued that they open up a dialogical mode of thinking that elevates the \nhybrid, connected nature of the relationships between civilisations.32 \n \nThis line of thinking has led to a third, in some ways more subversive, \nstrategy (iii) for decolonising thought, as a critique of the particular European \nsubjects immanent and naturalised in the writing of History itself.  The \nargument here is that historiographical understandings of change and \ndevelopment, even for critical historians, are understood in terms of \ncategories and trajectories that were seen as significant in the emergence of \nEurope\u2019s modernity, thus excluding the significance of the pluralities of pasts, \npresents and futures that were and are happening elsewhere, to which this \nmodernity was necessarily connected. This line of thought was extended from \nthe work of the Subaltern Studies group, who took issue specifically with the \nclaim in Marx and Hobsbawm that the colonies were \u2018outside history\u2019 prior to \ntheir insertion into the European capitalist system, although this critique was \nextended to other historiographies.33 This understanding of history, they \nargued, preserved the centrality of an underlying European referent subject to \nthe telling of history, even when that history was intended to be of elsewhere, \nand even if such history was critical or myth-shattering, and even if such \n                                                 \n29 Halperin, S.

Alison Ayers\u2019 work on an African \nhistoriography makes a similar point about the histories of democracy that \nbegin in Europe and are translated to African contexts, without any \nconsciousness of alternative and autonomously developed traditions within \nAfrica itself.36  \n \nThe historiographical critiques make manifest a seeming paradox at the \ncentre of decolonising strategies for social inquiry, which is that despite this \nproblematisation of the exclusions of social theory, it must nonetheless \ncontinue to employ in some sense this intellectual inheritance as a means of \nengagement and response. This is in some senses an important tension \nbetween the approaches of the second strategy, which are more clearly aimed \nat a straightforward rebuttal of myths, and this third strategy which \ninterrogates the conduct of inquiry itself. Certainly this is a perennial critique \nput by those operating outside the paradigm, who complain that decolonising \nstrategies are \u2018really\u2019 or \u2018ultimately\u2019 \u2018Western\u2019 or even \u2018liberal\u2019 in content and \noutlook.37 Partly in response to this issue, for some, this has prompted the \nresponse of seeking much more widely for intellectual resources from non-\nWestern traditions to think about the international, as Ayers does.38 However, \nas I will elaborate in the conclusion, by and large there is little need for \nanxiety about this issue, insofar as decolonising strategies are self-conscious \nabout the \u2018geocultural\u2019 conditions of their production, and the strategic \npurposes for which they are employed.39 Indeed the emphasis on the \ninherently dialogic production of societies, selves and social analysis that \nmeans that accusations of inauthenticity which presuppose the possibility of \nan \u2018authentic\u2019 self become misplaced. Moreover, by retaining a consciousness \nof these as \u2018strategies\u2019 we are alive to these circumscriptions of purpose and \norigins.  \n \n                                                 \n34 Chakrabarty, D.

Often, as in \nthe case of Chakrabarty and others, this involves multiple layering of ideas \nand sources in order to build up the understanding of the lifeworld as \nconcrete experience. Mohanty\u2019s call for this engaged and detailed empirical \nwork as a means of appreciating fully both different domains of power and \nthe meanings given to the various structures also supports this approach.44 \nClearly this strategy is connected with and complementary to the previous \none which problematises the adequacy of universalist historiographies and \nnarratives for a diverse social world.  \n \nHowever, this strategy, most closely connected with standpoint \ntheories in general, begins to pose important questions for decolonising \napproaches to the study of world politics \u2013 in particular in thinking about the \nrelevance of particular experiences and worlds to the questions about world \npolitics which are pitched at an ostensibly general level. What weight should \nbe given to the inter\/subjective interpretations of subaltern peoples about \ntheir experiences of domination? Do these entail a commitment to the \n                                                 \n40 An interesting example of this, developed somewhat separately from the Subaltern Studies \nmovement is Honwana, R. and A.

For example, the controversy about \u2018objectivity\u2019 \nonly makes sense where the value of work is primarily evaluated through the \nprior commitment to mind-world dualism which suggests a direct form of \ncomparability between competing explanatory frameworks.47 Where the \nnotion of social inquiry as objective \u2018science\u2019 is rejected, as in many \ndecolonising approaches, and the principal concern is for \u2018worlding\u2019 our \nunderstanding of social relations \u2013 as discussed for example by Agathangelou \nand Ling, or by Said48 - this suggests that interpretive and non-interpretive \nunderstandings can and should be intertwined and work in dialogue with \neach other. As I will suggest in my discussion of applying these strategies to \nmy own research, the weight given to each will tend to depend on the nature \nof the research question and the normative commitments entailed. This is \nconsistent with the way Fanon sets up the problem \u2013 he makes clear from the \noutset that he is interested in understanding how colonialism de-humanises \u2013 as \nsuch the relevance of the phenomenological is closely integrated with Fanon\u2019s \nconception of humanity as requiring both \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018subjective\u2019 \nengagement.49 For these other critiques too, it is a humanist and pluralist ethic \nwhich drives the interest in the exploration of the lifeworld, but not at the \nexpense of thinking about how these might be interpellated into what can be \nunderstood as broader political structures.   \n \nA fifth strategy (v) which relates to, but is somewhat distinct from, \nthese modes of rethinking history is the recovery of alternative political \nsubjecthoods in both historical and contemporaneous contexts. CLR James\u2019 \nThe Black Jacobins has served as one point of departure for this strategy, which \nwas a story of slave emancipation written at a time where Black and Asian \n                                                 \n45 Harding, S.

This was a reply to contemporaneous scientific \nracist discourses on Black political subjecthood that emphasised its incapacity, \nas well as alternative conceptions of decolonisation which were more \nconservative and reformist in outlook.50 Ongoing interpretations of the \nsignificance of the Haitian revolution have also sought to read within it the \npossibility of an emancipatory ideal of politics and political subjecthood for \nformerly colonised peoples that do not necessarily imply the passive diffusion \nor acceptance of European norms.51 Gandhian conceptions of swaraj and \nsatyagraha are a further example of this strategy \u2013 the articulation of political \nsubjecthood that offers an alternative vision of the bases of authority, rule and \nresistance to those conceived under colonial rule, that are not simply \nimitations of secular nationalism but resonate with and draw on particular \ncultural and spiritual tropes.   \n \nWithin IR, Shilliam has used a similar strategy in terms of pitching \nRastafarian cosmologies of freedom as a claim and counterpoint to \nuniversalist developmental ones, which represent the contemporary mould \nfor ideas surrounding international development and engagement in the \nThird World.52  This strategy is of course closely linked to the attempts to de-\ncentre Europe as the referent subject for historical accounts; instead it is a \nprovincialisation of the concept of individualist secular citizenship as the only \nreferent frame for politically relevant being.53 Instead, through a privileging of \nthe contextually grounded character of political subjecthood, this strategy \nattempts to elucidate rather than suppress alterity.54  \n                                                 \n50 Scott, D.

In thinking about the extent to which decolonising strategies are \nviewed as controversial, despite few disputes on their objectives or normative \norientation, it seems that much revolves around an apparent willingness to \nreject human similarity in favour of valorising human difference, giving up \nboth analytic and moral ground to some sort of relativism.56  \n \nMuch has been said in response to this problem, and I will not cover \nthe relevant issues here.57 I am sympathetic to work that suggests that the \ntension is inescapable.58 Indeed, in the abstract it makes little sense either \nanalytically or morally to deny either sameness or difference as foundational \naspects of existence. The real question, then, is what the limits of their \nrelevance might be, and the extent to which we can presume this ahead of \ntime. As I suggest in the application of this strategy to a particular problem, \nthere is a large extent to which different emphases might be reasonable \nchoices in different circumstances.  \n \nOne final strategy (vi) of the decolonising project in broader social \ntheory that is only just beginning to take off self-consciously within IR is the \nattempt to comprehend, challenge and displace the presumed psychic and \npsychologically-understood \u2018subjects\u2019 that are produced by and support \nvarious aspects of international relations.  This is however consistent with the \nlow level of attention given to the affective dimension of politics within the \ndiscipline as a whole.59 However, the emergence of considerations of the \naffective and psychic dimensions of international politics within IR has also \nstimulated a decolonising critique of the particular origins of this view of the \nself.

See . \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 16 \nRelations demonstrates clearly the limits of the neo-Aristotelian basis on which \nthe human psyche is imagined in this text, pitching as an alternative a \nFanonian conception of colonised subjectivity as a necessarily embodied or \n\u2018situated\u2019 subjectivity.60 This is in distinction to the presumed mind-body \ndistinction that underpins the conception of the psyche in Lebow. In re-\nimagining the security bonds between states, Chen, Hwang and Ling \nintroduce questions of ambivalent postcolonial longing through the allegory \nof the relationships in the film Lust\/Caution.61 The displacement of the \nrationalist, masculinist subjectivity\/psyche attributed implicitly to states\u2019 \nrelations with each other within security studies with one that is more \ncomplex, situated, affective and particular is a useful move, and seems to \ndeliver a compelling account of the relationship between mainland China and \nTaiwan. Whilst these two pieces consist of very different analyses, they both \nuse a strategy which looks at the ways in which the presumed seeing subject \nof world politics identifies itself, with itself and with other entities, and show \nhow this vision is tied to both particular locations and particular \npsychological assumptions, often masking the inherently dialogical and \nrelational production of the self. 62 The decolonising project thus seeks to \nexamine and problematise this tethering, and in doing so start to imagine \nalternative sites of departure. \n \n It is noteworthy that this final strategy of challenging the presumed \npsyche of international actors emerges principally in response to a particular \nprovocation \u2013 namely the anthropomorphisation of the state in a culturally \nand gender specific way in analysis. In this sense it principally relates to the \ndisciplinary context of IR, the mainstream of which has moved from treating \nstates as \u2018billiard balls\u2019 to treating them as \u2018people\u2019.63 Although as yet not \nwidely developed, it is a particularly useful challenge to lay to a discipline \nthat continually attempts to update its core ontologies in a way which is \nseemingly disembedded from the evaluative content of this theory.  \n \n \n  \n                                                 \n60 Shilliam, R.

This has not, as far as my understanding of developments in these two fields \ngoes, led to a problematisation of the imagined psychological subject which serves as a \nbaseline for analysis, but it is a longstanding problematisation of the assumptions of \ninstrumental rationalities as dominating these two processes.  \n63 See the Review of International Studies forum, 2004, Volume 30, Issue 2. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 17 \n \nDecolonising strategies: central questions \n \n Given the breadth of their conceptual concerns and intellectual \napproaches, how, then, do decolonising strategies operate in a way which is \nmore dialogic than other modes of studying world politics? Why might these \nbe better? And what does this entail in terms of applying these strategies to \nother areas of research?  \n \n Whilst there is increasing recognition that there are a plurality of ways \nto study world politics, decolonising strategies, through pluralising the \nsubjects of inquiry, offer an intellectual platform for making good the ambition \nof a discipline that has been trying to transcend its imperial, colonial and \nracist roots.64 What they also expose however is the deep implications and \neffects these roots have had on the ways of thinking within social theory at a \nbroad level as well as within the discipline, across theoretical divides. By \nseeing this as a set of particularistic intellectual choices, they may provincialise \nrather than reject wholesale these modes of analysis, meaning dialogue about \ntheir relevance and structure is not only possible but imperative. The act of \nprovincialising particular perspectives and introducing the relevance of \nothers is a way of making inquiry itself a dialogue \u2013 speaking across different \nsubject positions \u2013 about the world rather than a single narrative which might \nbe more agnostic about its exclusions. \n \nA central question that these strategies seem to generate is about the \nlevel of co-implication between normative and analytic exclusions \u2013 whether \nand how the forms of intellectual discrimination which are exercised in the \nconduct of analysis, e.g. in a state-centric analysis of the international system \nor a Gramscian account of capitalist hegemony, always reproduce types of \npolitical and normative discrimination which we would consider problematic. \nFor example, one might accept that these failed to represent the experiences of \nmany in the world or continued to be Eurocentric but nonetheless had \nexplanatory purchase on events in the international arena by virtue of their \nability to parse events in a coherent manner.  \n \nMuch might depend on the extent to which this work acknowledged or \nfailed to acknowledge its shortcomings as a piece of humanist research. Given \nbroad overlapping consensuses on a) the inherently purposive character of \ninquiry, b) the necessarily perspectival character of knowledge and c) the \n                                                 \n64 Vitalis, R.

If these really are three \nfoundational assumptions for research then recognising and managing the \ntensions these generate seems a rather more intellectually honest if precarious \nway forward.  As Mervyn Frost has argued, this is not about \u2018adding\u2019 \nnormative values to structural analysis but making clear what is \ncommitments are already implicit.66 \n \nSuch tensions include the co-implication between frames which enable \nanalysis through comparison or modelling and frames which suppress \npotentially relevant difference. However, in general decolonising strategies \nhave tended to deal with this through putting these elements into dialogue \nwith one another and formalising this tension in the concept of \u2018worlding\u2019. \nSaid\u2019s call for contrapuntal analysis conceives of these framings as part of a \nwider whole, in which the relationship between the two or more melody lines \nis as interesting, perhaps more so, than each line in and of itself.67 Note then, \nthat the substantive assumption returns here about the value any attempt to \nnarrate the world single-handedly or monologically \u2013 it will remain \ninadequate and partial. Moreover, it may persist in cementing structures of \nexclusion that continue to deny the experience of \u2018most of the world\u2019 in \nChatterjee\u2019s expression as legitimate bases of knowledge. Whilst \u2018worlding\u2019 \nwill still produce analyses that exclude important analytic and experiential \nissues, this is a better way to think about a diverse and hierarchical world \nthan by denying this diversity. \n \nThis section, through unpicking the contributions of decolonising \nstrategies in world politics, has sought to re-articulate the project in a way \nwhich demonstrates both its existing uses and possible future uses in the \nstudy of world politics. As indicated at the outset, however, one of the \nreasons for reflecting on decolonising thought and its commitments has been \nto work through how it might be more widely applied.  \n \nI now turn to a particular research framing in order to explore more \ndeeply the potential for re-thinking IR through this typology. Drawing on a \nwider research project, this case study specifically demonstrates the ways in \nwhich the typology developed above helps re-frame critical approaches to \nworld politics, which express concerns for Western hegemony or imperialism \n                                                 \n65 There may be a less broad consensus on this, although few who would be prepared to \nadmit to such in print.  \n66 Frost., op. cit. \n67 Chowdry, op.cit.  \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 19 \nbut without an adequate intellectual framing to redress the problem of \nexclusion that they identify. I reconfigure the problematic of the 'liberal \npeace', widely employed in the critical literature, through imagining \n'Mozambique' as the relevant subject of inquiry in different ways. I do this \nthrough an alternative historical grounding, through exploring shared \nconceptions of political subjecthood and how these shape an engagement \nwith international co-operation, and through exploring the lifeworld of social \nrelations that this co-operation is part of in a variegated middle class. By \nforegrounding these subjecthoods, critique can move away from assuming the \nnon-West as a space of insuperable difference and move towards a more \narticulate, inclusive and concrete dialogue about the nature of international \npower.  \n \n \n\u2018Changing the subjects\u2019: decolonising the 'liberal peace' in Mozambique \n \nA central topic in the study of world politics is the nature and structure \nof international power and authority. There is widespread agreement that in \nthe contemporary world something called the 'West' remains predominant in \nvarious spheres, although much dispute takes place regarding the nature, \norigins, durability and effects of that power.  Is the power hard or soft?68 Is it \nbased in military, ideological or capitalist expansion? Does it support or \nundermine international institutions? Is it best characterised as operating \nthrough consent, coercion, hegemony or governmentality? A particular \ncritical debate in this broader literature, emerging from the confluence of \npeace studies, IR and globalisation theory is about the nature of the 'liberal \npeace', as discussed by writers such as Duffield, Paris, Chandler and \nRichmond.69   \n \nThis research programme has a clear relevance in terms of \ncontemporary global politics, addressing a wide range of political and ethical \nquestions regarding the legitimacy, political effects and effectiveness of \nWestern power. At least some of these questions emerge from the claims of \ncertain governments to be acting the interests of humanity as a whole or on \nthe basis of the will to help the internationally vulnerable rather than simply \nnational self-interest. This coheres with seemingly inclusive cosmopolitan \nstances on the need for globally-promoted standards of governance in \npolitical and social life. Clearly, questions about the liberal peace are relevant \nnot only to the more narrowly defined activities of peacebuilding missions, \n                                                 \n68 Berenskoetter, F. and M.

My argument is that this research programme \nhas nonetheless failed to produce a dialogic account of this power, articulated \nthrough the perspectives of those supposedly subject to it. \n \nThe principal thrust of the critique is that multilateral intervention in \npost-war environments in the name of peacebuilding powerfully cements and \nadvances Western control and transformation of these societies through \neconomic and political liberalisation, the institutionalisation of conditional \nforeign aid flows and related governance monitoring mechanisms in the state, \nand the attempted re-making of civil society through the promotion of liberal \nvalues.70 This is in some cases analysed as being problematic due to the \nimplications for political sovereignty and the principle of autonomy,71 in \nothers due to the increased vulnerability of economies to market forces,72 in \nothers consolidation of Western power over the South,73 and in others as for \npromoting social and political arrangements more likely to lead to conflict \nthan not.74 In each of these cases, analogies with former European imperialism \nand the civilising mission have been drawn. These analogies are of critical \nmoral, ethical and political salience given the contemporary de-legitimisation \nof these historical practices.  \n \nThese critiques have been hugely productive in terms of generating an \nextensive critical narrative on the nature of international peacebuilding, and \nreflect much of the richness of contemporary critical theory in IR, including \nneo-Gramscian, Foucauldian and feminist responses. It is not my intention to \nsuggest that what has been said is fundamentally wrong or misguided \u2013 on \nthe contrary it has been very important and generally illuminating. \nNonetheless, despite an anxiety about the hegemony of the West and the \npolitical exclusions generated by the liberal peace, these global critiques have \nlargely failed to dislodge it as the central subject of inquiry,  in many of the \nsenses described in the previous section. Although these critiques profess \ninterest in advancing an agenda \u2018in solidarity with the governed\u2019 or more \nattuned to the \u2018everyday\u2019, their modes of analysing world order end up \nreproducing, perhaps unintentionally, many of the exclusions they critique.

However, the debate is framed through a contrast \nbetween the \u2018liberal\u2019\/ \u2018Western\u2019 and the \u2018local\u2019 or \u2018non-liberal\u2019 \u2013 as defined \nvariously by \u2018kinship\u2019, \u2018custom\u2019, \u2018agency\u2019, \u2018the individual\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, \n\u2018tradition\u2019 and so forth.79 Although it is argued that this transcends the \ncolonial gaze through calling for a hybrid, post-liberal peace, centred on the \n\u2018everyday\u2019, it is difficult to see how the rationale does not also simultaneously \nre-assert particular assumptions about the centrality and coherence of \nWestern agency and the necessity for Western engagement to bring peace in \nthe non-liberal non-West. This \u2018local\u2019 space, whilst contrasted to the space of \npower, is also represented as banalised \u2013 \u2018everyday\u2019 \u2013 rather than politicised \nas such.80 Difference, where it exists, is primarily represented as cultural or \n\u2018customary\u2019 in character.  \n \nThis pattern of exclusion is repeated within the other literature in the \nlocating of the historical subject of analysis as the post-imperial Western states \nqua interveners, represented through the backstory of UN peacebuilding \nmissions or more broadly Western development aid, or nineteenth century \ncolonial policy.81 In this manner, the West is also represented as a coherent \npolitical subject with its formative essence in the Enlightenment, in capitalism, \nin imperialism \u2013 a liberal subject that seeks to universalise itself through \nmodern forms of liberal governance.82  \n \n                                                 \n75 Hobson (2007) \u2018Is critical theory always for the white West and Western imperialism?\u2019, \nop.cit. \n76 E.g. in Duffield, (2007), ch. 7. \n77 I expand on this point in Sabaratnam, M (2011) \u2018Situated critiques of intervention: \nMozambique and the diverse politics of response\u2019, in Campbell, S., Chandler, D. and \nSabaratnam, M (2011 \/ forthcoming) A Liberal Peace?

For example, by using this framework, attention is drawn to \nthe fact that there are few substantive articulations of these societies as \npotentially distinctive or significant subjects of politics and history, and \nextremely few examinations of the ways in which people and groups within \nthem have interpreted or engaged the practices and agents of intervention.84 \nAs such, the potential for the exploration of possible alternatives to it through \na dialogic and situated understanding of this relationship is deeply inhibited.  \n \nIn counterpoint and contrast to these critiques, I have sought to \nreconstruct an analysis of the liberal peace that foregrounds as alternative \n\u2018subjects\u2019 of analysis the society which is normally rendered its \u2018object\u2019. I deal \nwith a specific site which seemingly expresses par excellence the power of the \nliberal transformation agenda through peacebuilding and development \u2013 \nongoing multilateral presence in Mozambique. I attempt to think about it in a \nway which deliberately attempts deeper engagement with and appreciation of \nthe intended recipients as politically and historically located subjects whose \nexperiences and interpretations of the so-called liberal peace can be used in \nthe \u2018worlding\u2019 of analysis.85 However, I will go on to identify various \nconstraints that limit the reach of this dialogic strategy.  \n \nA preliminary step in this process is to re-locate understanding of the \nliberal peace not in the history of the West but within the social and political \nhistory of Mozambique. To do this, I set out the contemporary period in a \nrelationship to late colonialism and the post-independence socialist regime. \nThis means that the foregrounded issues are about the relations and struggles \nbetween different groups, the nature of state, the political economy, social and \npolitical authority, the experiences of war and the nature of the peace, in \nwhich international interactions play a role but do not occlude these other \nissues.

See chapter in Tadjbaksh, S. ed. (2011) Rethinking the \nLiberal Peace: External Models and Local Alternatives, Routledge. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 23 \npeace' as a focal point is not unproblematic \u2013 it also relies on occluding and \nstylising particular issues in order to foreground a particular focus on the \n\u2018imagined community\u2019 of Mozambique as a subject of history. It is also \nimportant to acknowledge that this construction of history has been closely \nassociated with the political decolonisation and nationalist project, and \nremains internally contested within Mozambique itself.86 Nonetheless, insofar \nas critics of the liberal peace have expressed an interest in the hegemony of \nthe West over these societies, and insofar as people within this society identify \nwith the category it can be a useful place to dialogue from about the \nrelationship. It also forces a re-thinking of historical agency, usually narrated \nas being the preserve of intervening powers, in part because we now \nunderstand what an alternative historical agenda might look like from the \npoint of view of social relations in Mozambique.  \n \nA further step is to engage the ways in which this history has given rise \nto complex structures of authority and legitimacy that shape political \nsubjecthoods and subjectivities, which strongly shape how the liberal peace is \nunderstood, enacted and experienced. The presumptive exclusion of these \nfactors from an assessment of whether the liberal peace might or might not be \nunderstood as \u2018legitimate\u2019 seems to reduce a priori a discussion of the issue to \nthe discursive framing of the analyst, excluding the possibility of a dialogic \nengagement on these issues. For example, engaging public commentaries on \nthe question of corruption \u2013 acknowledged as a key theme in the liberal \ngovernance agenda \u2013 demonstrates both that many see the spread of \ncorruption as emerging historically with the influx of post-conflict aid and the \nprocess of privatisation.87 This viewpoint should give us pause for thought in \nreflecting on the liberal peace relationship, as it counter-argues the claim of \nthe liberal peace to be a general agent of \u2018good governance\u2019 in a much more \npowerful way than critiques which have not interrogated this stylised \nnarrative. Furthermore, engaging with historical political discourses about \ncorruption further highlights that a concern with corruption is not unique to \ndonor discourses about governance but has a broader political resonance, \nwhich is not simply dismissable as the symptom of a comprador elite trying \nto win favour. On the contrary, through engaging how corruption is \nunderstood within popular culture, we can see that it also emerges as a potent \ncritique of elites themselves at various times and places.88 \n                                                 \n86 For a minority position, for example, see Cabrita, J.

In \nparticular, this requires thinking about the specific mechanisms through \nwhich the liberal peace is supposedly deployed and thinking about how these \nare interpreted.89 I have sought to do this both through secondary research on \nethnographies undertaken in rural areas whilst the liberal peace has been \nimplemented, and through a series of observations and interviews of people \nworking at the interface of donor projects and aid. This brings to the fore not \nonly important aspects of interpretation but also a raft of issues and problems \nusually assigned to the realm of the \u2018mundane\u2019 which nonetheless \nsignificantly shape the actual practices of the liberal peace. As just one \nexample, the ways in which the practices of development and \ndemocratisation assistance restructure material incentives for  large numbers \nof professional and semi-skilled workers away from long-term employment \nin national organisations, as well as the highly repetitive and cyclical turnover \nof foreign staff leads to relatively widespread cynicism and alienation that is \nnot necessarily based on an ideological or cultural rejection of liberalism but \nthe clearer problem that there is very wide hypocrisy in a system which is \nself-interested and ineffective. \n \n These examples demonstrate briefly the added value of the typology \nearlier developed in the paper as a frame for approaching the task of \ndecolonising world politics through the extension of dialogue. By articulating \nthe key problem as one of the \u2018subjects\u2019 of analysis, doors are opened in terms \nof thinking about how to rethink the liberal peace in ways which do not \nreproduce its own simplified and binaristic understandings of the world.  \n \nA good question to ask might be \u2018why does it matter\u2019? So what if \npolitical life in Mozambique is structured around the navigation of post-\ncolonial identity, and so what if anti-corruption laws speak to memories of the \nsocialist past? How does this help us think critically about international \npower relations? I would argue that bringing this research back into the \nconversation about the liberal peace begins to lay the platform for a \nconceptual and political dialogue about what is at stake when we \u2018world\u2019 our \nanalysis. One issue that seems to become clear is that the division between a \n\u2018liberal\u2019 West and a non-liberal non-West does not really seem to reflect either \n                                                                                                                                            \nPower): http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RhSKixT-n0w&feature=related; \u2018As Mentiras da \nVerdade\u2019  (trans. The Lies of Truth) \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b9IwDjrUNTE&feature=related  \n89 I specify these along the lines elaborated by Duffield, Richmond and Mac Ginty. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 25 \nidentities or practices in a place like Mozambique, and should not be the basis \non which our understanding of the liberal  peace is constructed. \n \nThis might mean that some of the ethical-political-practical questions \nraised by the literature which turn on the distinction drop out, with others \ntaking their place. One replacement question might be about the extent to \nwhich ameliorative interventions structurally re-form social relations and the \nknowledge base around their short-termist and superficial needs. Another \nmight be about the extent to which the liberal peace does not pursue a \ntransformative political agenda which re-makes the South but a rather \nconservative one which preserves its partisans and deflects pressures for \nchange.  These kinds of issues can only come to the fore when we change the \n\u2018subjects\u2019 of our analysis and begin to attempt to get to grips with the \ninherently multi-faceted quality of these relationships.  \n \nHowever, the approach that I have set out as a mode of \u2018decolonising\u2019 \nthe liberal peace is in no way exhaustive and necessarily instantiates its own \nexclusions. As such, it adds only a few more interlocutors \u2013 many of whom \nare in some senses \u2018elite\u2019 \u2013 to the dialogue out of many possible ones, \nalthough these interlocutors are very important. These limitations are \ncertainly not trivial in the context of work that seeks to \u2018democratise\u2019 our \nunderstanding of world politics. Clearly, these exclusions are in some senses \nborne of habits of analysis developed and trained in a particular academic \nsetting, and they reflect shortcomings in terms of possible depths of \nengagement.  In others, they simply reflect the need to limit the ambitions of \nany single work \u2013 for example, I have used only three of the six distinctive \nstrategies above at this time, selected through my judgements about their \nviability, compatibility and relevance for the research framing. \n \nI hope, nonetheless, that they demonstrate a need for IR scholars, and \nperhaps critical theorists in particular to think about the links between analytic \nand political exclusion, which lies behind the call for not just more \u2018debate\u2019 but \ngreater \u2018dialogue\u2019 in the discipline. This is particularly given the context in \nwhich the power of the liberal peace is justified politically and intellectually \u2013 \nthat is, specifically on its desire and ability to deliver a more just and peaceful \norder in the name of war-torn societies and victims of conflict. Yet without \nengaging with those societies as real historical and political subjects, they \nremain objectified and voiceless in both politics and intellectual analysis.  \n \nAnalytic inclusion in itself does not however \u2018solve\u2019 any problems as \nsuch \u2013 indeed, it properly raises a vast array of new ones. This is the point \nfrom a disciplinary perspective \u2013 to help re-frame the questions about \ninternational power in terms that appreciate and reflect the situations of the \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 26 \nintended recipients, in a manner which is explicit, accountable, and grounded \nin detailed engagement and argument. The ultimate importance of this \nintervention in the ongoing conversation is not something that can be settled \nwithin the terms of the study itself but rather in its dialogue with existing \nstudies and the broader context of public discourses about the liberal peace.  \n \n \nFacilitating dialogue: the under-appreciated value of learning-in-exile \n \nEven if, however, if one is convinced of the need for problematising the \nsubjecthoods of international politics through deep empirical engagement \nwith those normally excluded, there are several practical barriers to being able \nto do so, which themselves need to be highlighted and challenged. A further \nissue worth considering is the way in which we as an academic community of \nscholars view ourselves and what we do that deeply conditions our ability to \nexecute the kinds of work that the decolonising project demands of us \npersonally. It is an uncomfortable but necessary admission that we are \nperhaps (though not exclusively) not (yet) fit for purpose, a problem which \nmakes us all the more needful of dialogic modes of engagement.   \n \nBy this, I principally mean that we should not shrink from recognising \nthe limits of our own perspectives and the value of trying to learn from others, \nand the necessarily incomplete nature of our endeavours. This of course \ninvolves appreciating the process of studying particular places and cases as a \nlearning process, and devoting time and energy to improving our own skills \u2013 \nin languages, historical techniques and so on. These take significant resources \nof time, energy, money and commitment for which there is limited incentive \nand support beyond one\u2019s postgraduate research methods course. Indeed, \ngiven professional pressures to publish and teach,90 it is possible to say that \nfurther training and deep empirical and applied engagement with alternative \nsubject positions is structurally inhibited within the discipline.  \n \nThese perhaps obvious constraints have very serious analytic and \npolitical consequences in terms of maintaining the discipline\u2019s tendencies \ntowards Eurocentrism in research. It is unsurprising that the decolonising \nproject requires scholars to look at sources and work quite outside the \ndiscipline for these alternative perspectives, and also unsurprising that the \nempirical groundings of projects often do not seem completely satisfying. \nWhen the necessary periods of exile are limited to the few weeks between \nterms and funded only partially by institutions and departments, one\u2019s \n                                                 \n90 These are of course pressures exacerbated by present pressures on the higher education \nsystem. \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 27 \nmobility is deeply curtailed. Re-shaping where possible the opportunities for \nengaged research is no less important a task  \n \nMore than this, however, treating the decolonising project as being \nabout a process of learning is about the spirit or posture in which the research \nis undertaken and then presented. If the decolonising project is about taking \nthe perspectival character of knowledge seriously, then the unsettling of \nwhere epistemic authority lies between \u2018researcher\u2019 and \u2018subject\u2019 is a \nnecessary part of it. Whilst our professional identities, and moreover our \npersonal ones, will require us to re-occupy a space in various epistemic \nhierarchies, as scholars and teachers, a consciousness that this is a fragile and \ntenuous place imbued with power often presumed rather than justified \nshould encourage an openness to dialogue and alternative perspectives. In a \npractical sense, this could start with putting more value on collaborative \nwork, as well as working harder to promote awareness of work from \nmarginalised perspectives, even if we have not produced it ourselves. Whilst \nthere are always strategic closures within any analysis, nonetheless a \ndecolonising project in social theory that is working to think in terms of, \nperhaps counter-intuitively, heterogeneous and marginalised subjects of \nworld politics, with an appreciation of how to push the limits of this \nendeavour, will contribute to the broader question of democratising world \npolitics. \n \n \nConclusions: Decolonising future horizons \n \n This piece has argued that enabling dialogue in international relations \nrequires us to get to grips with the nature of the \u2018subjects\u2019 of this dialogue and \nof our research. It has shown through its suggested typology that \ndecolonising strategies are connected and contested around this common \npreoccupation. I have also argued that this can be a productive way to think \nabout the problem of international power structures in a more inclusive way, \nthrough an illustrative case in which these strategies are applied to a wider \nresearch project.  \n \nThrough engaging with the preoccupations and strategies of \ndecolonising thought in the course of my research, I have become alive to the \nmultiple ways in which even in a politically decolonised age, variously \ncolonial and imperial ideas permeate the ways in which the contemporary \nworld is understood and represented, even in critical thought. Whilst, given \nthe intertwined character of modernity with colonialism in Europe, this is not \naltogether surprising, the academy has been relatively slow to elaborate ways \nof seeing and engaging that might help unpick some of these myths and \nSabaratnam \u2013 IR in Dialogue \nFebruary 2011 \nMillennium: Journal of International Studies, 39:3, 781-803 \n 28 \nframings of world order. Nonetheless, as I hope I have shown, this is not for \nwant of innovative intellectual strategies for decolonising our analyses, which \ncan inspire new ways of researching that offer a less exclusionary terrain for \ndialogue.  \n \nSubstantive questions remain, for which there may be no answers that \nsatisfy everyone. In particular, the emphasis on the sources and nature of \nalterity present key tensions. Can you really \u2018do\u2019 social theory that is \nultimately respectful of difference? What are legitimate and illegitimate \ndifferentiations between people in the conduct of social inquiry? In whose \nname is inquiry carried out, and who benefits from it? Can \u2018dialogue\u2019 be a \nsatisfactory alternative to Eurocentrism, given the persistence of this \nintellectual baggage in constructing alternatives?   \n \nMany decolonising strategies have recognised these seeming \nparadoxes. These paradoxes are not just \u2018theoretical\u2019 but also pervaded the \npractical problems faced by the protagonists of Third World decolonisation in \nthe twentieth century. Although it is a now-standard response to these issues, \nmaintaining a reflexive and non-dogmatic approach to our conceptual lenses \nis clearly important, and being explicit about the objectives of engagement \nand analysis more so. However, it would be to capitulate too much to suggest \nthat decolonising theory is somehow more theoretically compromised by such \na stance in a way that other approaches are not. Simply being prepared to \nadmit and consider deeply the relevance of these issues does not mean that \nthey do not apply to other theoretical frames \u2013 it is more that they are \nsystematically ignored.  \n \n\u2018Decolonising\u2019 \u2018IR\u2019 may not work as full accommodation or logical \ncoherence between the two terms, but it might produce some things which sit \nbetter than the alternatives. Yet, for dialogue about world politics to be fully \nrealised, decolonising strategies and lines of argument require and deserve \nreplies from mainstream IR rather than being simply included without \ncomment in the burgeoning roster.  Although so far, decolonising strategies \nhave been treated as little more than \u2018local difficulties\u2019,  given conferences like \nthis these modes of thought seem to be spreading in popularity and \nsophistication. This paper has aimed to add some small momentum to what is \nan exciting research movement in the discipline, through opening up some \nexplicit ways in which particular problems and conceptual framings might be \nre-imagined.   \n \n"}
