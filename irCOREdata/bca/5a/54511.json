Approaches based on the Extended Kalman\nFilter (EKF) are presented to provide correction for offset, drift and state divergence-an unfortunate\nfeature of more traditional coulomb-counting teelunques. Experiinental results are einployed to\ndemonstrate the relative attributes of tle proposed methodology.\nIntroduction\nPeak power buffers of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are, by their very nature, subject to large dynamic\ntransients in cuTenit ald power demand. Road data collected from a Honda Insight HEV (RHOLAB\ndriving cycle [1]), where peak charge- and discharge-cLurent delands of s_60A and -lOOA, respectively,\nare required from the battery pcack when subjected to a series of vehicle drivinlg tests [1]. The\naccommodation of suchl operating conditions requires that thle management system have accurate\nknowledge of the peak power buffer's SoC to facilitate safe and efficient operation. Failure to control\nSoC will ultimately lead to under- or over-charging conditions, which can degrade the ability of the pack\nto source\/sink subsequenlt power transients.\nA variety of techniques have been proposed to meastre or mnonitor the SoC of a cell or battery, with\ncharge counting or cu:rrent integration at present being the most commonly used techlnique. However, due\nto the reliance on integration, errors in terminal measurements (ie to noise, resolution and rounding are\ntaPE 2005 Dresden P.1\nBENTELY Ilad\nE1?E 2005 - iiAcm ISBSN :9075815-08-5 I,.

Furthennore. manufacturers of JIEVs would like predictions\nof the State-of-Health (SoH) or State-of-Function (SoF) of a battery pack, since the increasing reliance on\ndrive-by-wire technologies is making the battety a key safety-critical colmponent of the vehicle.\nKnowledge of whether a battery will fail when suLbject to high transient loadings, as may be experienced\nin emergency braking, for instance, is therefore essential. However, SoH monitoring techniques are\ncurrently in their infancy, with- little beinlg reported to-date.\nHer-e then, model-based state-estimation techniques are proposed for predicting states of a cell that would\nnor-mally be difficult or expensive to measure. Measuremenlts using r-eal-time road data are used to\ncompare the performance of convenitional integration-based mnethods for estimating SoC, with those\npredicted from the presenlted state estimation schelnes. Reslts show that the proposed methodologies are\nsupenor to more tradlitional techlniques, with accuracy in determining the SoC within 2%, being\ndemonstrated. Moreover, by accounting for the nonlinearities present within die dynamic cell model, die\napplication of an EKF is shown to provide verifiable indications of SoH of the cell pack via the real-time\nstate estimation. Experimental results ultimately show the ability of the EKF to track changes ald to\ncompensate for inaccuracies in the initial estimates of cell model btlLk capacitalce. that can be considered\nas a meastre of the cell's capacity.\nBattery Model\nA dynamic model of the battery, in the form of state variable equLations, is lnecessary to predict the SoC or\nSoH. Here, a generic model [2] consisting of a bulk capacitor, cb,jk, to characterise the ability of the\nbattery to store charge, a capacitor to model surface capacitance and diffusion effects within the cell\nC$S,,, ,Sa terminal resistance R, surface resistance R, and end resistance, R, is employed as shoown by\nFig. 1. The voltage across the bulk- ald surface- capacitors are denoted Vcb alid Vcs, respectively.\nThe cell tested in this paper is a novel, spiral wouLnd, SAh sealed lead-acid cell, with terminals on either\nend, developed by Hawker (ENERSYS hc), Fig. 2. The doutble terminal encapsulation is introduced to\nlower grid currents, and hence, thermal gradients, and thereby pr-omote efficient utilization of the active\nmaterials in the cell, thus leading to a battery tat is optimised for the high-power duties typical of hybrid\ndriving cycles.\nInitial parameters of the cell, Fig. 1, are pre-calculated from experimental data, where open-circuit voltage\n(OCV) tests are performed tipon successive diseharges of thle battery, by injection of current pulses. An\ninitial estimate of Cb,,_ is obtained by analyzing the amount of stored energy in the cell (from SoC = 1 to\nSoC = 0), to a discharge current ptulses of 1.53A applied for t=ISOOs, every 3600s interval. Note that SoC\n1 is a normalized value used to define a fully-charged cell.

The available clarge stored within a fully-charged\ncell is expected to f-al with cell usage. Such capacity-loss mechanisms generally occur slowly in VRLA\nbatteries that are cycled at low-rates over their full SoC range. However, when operated as a peak power\nbuffer, in a HEV system, the cells are operated at a Partial State-of-Charge (PSoC) i.e. the cell is never\ncycled over its full SoC range, ald is subjected to both hiigh charge and discharge currents. StuLdies have\nshown that this PSoC operation can lead to tirLncated service life in VRLA cells [3,4]. Such capacity loss\ncam be deemed a loss of cell SoHf Early detection of SoH degradation wotdd allow a smart' battery pack\nto take remedial action, such as the application of conditioning routines to the cell, to remove small\nsulphate crystals before they form large inactive crystals, thlereby restoring the cells capacity. Measuring\ncell capacity by the standard meals of a low current discharge is impractical for HEV applications, ald\nonline techniqLes that utilise only cell terminal mneasuremenits. made whilst the 1-1EV is driven, are\ntherefore required.\nHere, a proposed means of estimating bulk capacitance Cb.,, , by adding an extra state, dCb,k, \/Id =0 , into\nthe observer structure, is demonstrated. Since the derivatives of Vc% and V. are now coupled by non-\nlinear elelnents, an EKF is reqLuired for effective estimation of state variables. However, note that the\nproposed reallisation results in an increase in order of the Jacobians, covariance, noise and distLrbance\nmatrices, withl a consequential increase in computation overhead.

Such control of the Smart VRLA module will significantly increase the lifetime of the cells for\nHEV delmnlds. FuLrthermore. from a manuLfacturers perspective, such data is extremely imnportalt for the\nultimate prediction of State-of-Function (SoF), which describes the ability of a cell to perform adequately\nunder HEV demamds. SoF will give a prediction of available capacity, and discharge and recharge\ncapability, thereby allowing Smart VRLA module to forecast thle response of eachl cell to drivinlg\ndemands, and leading to optimal utilisation of the batter-y pack with regard to perfor-mance and lifetime.\nand therefore. better overall energy managemenlt withil the vehicle.\nReferences\n[1] M.
