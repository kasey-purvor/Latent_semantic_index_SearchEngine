Nonetheless, this perception can properly be qualified provided:\n(i) that the review presents a really general, novel, but non-trivial view of a wide variety\nof problems linked by a common theme; and\n(ii) that it is clearly structured so that non-experts can pick up the general viewpoint and\ncentral ideas by reading the introduction and conclusions, while experts can readily\nchoose those sections that are of particular interest to them, to be read almost inde-\npendently of the rest of the work.\nWe hope that our review satisfies both conditions. A general overview and guide to content\nare presented in Section 1. The paper is aimed primarily at experts on fluctuations in\ndynamical systems (including to some extent quantum systems) and nonlinear dynamicists\ngenerally, as well as at those physicists who are interested in the behaviour of the particular\nsystems listed in Section 2.\n1 Introduction\nOscillatory behavior is typical of diverse systems in nature and plays a crucial role in many\nphenomena. This is true, not only of strictly periodic motion, but also of situations where\nthe periodicity is only approximate. Because the latter case is in a sense less fundamental,\nin that it may often be considered to arise through a weak perturbation of the former case,\nwe first consider a purely periodic motion. We take as an example the one-dimensional\nHamiltonian system:\nq\u02d9 =\n\u2202H(q, p)\n\u2202p\n, p\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H(q, p)\n\u2202q\n, (1.0.1)\nwhich can be taken to represent a common class of systems displaying periodic motion.\nThe quantity that is conserved during motion is the energy\nE = H(q, p). (1.0.2)\nThe motion is periodic and the frequency \u03c9 of oscillation generally depends on E (Fig. 1(a)).\nThere is, however, a special case where the frequency is independent of E, i.e. the har-\nmonic (or linear) oscillator, for which\nH(q, p) =\n\u03c920q\n2\n2\n+\np2\n2\n. (1.0.3)\n4\nIn this case, \u03c9(E) \u2261 \u03c90 [1] (Fig. 1(b)) and\nq(t) =\n\u221a\n2E\n\u03c90\ncos(\u03c90t+ \u03c60), (1.0.4)\nwhere \u03c60 is an initial angle.\nThat fact that eigenoscillations at different energies are resonant with each other has\nmany remarkable consequences: if a perturbation is applied that gives rise to a variation\nof energy, it has almost no effect on the resonant behavior of the angle. Thus, if a periodic\nforce of frequency close to \u03c90 is applied, the response is very strong: much stronger than in\nthe general case of an energy-dependent frequency (Fig. 1(a)). Similarly, if noise is applied\nthen, for a harmonic oscillator, the spectrum of fluctuations exhibits a narrow peak around\n\u03c90 whereas, for a nonlinear oscillator, the fluctuation spectrum is typically much broader\n[2\u20134] because noise activates a range of energies thus involving a correspondingly wide\nspectrum of frequencies.\nWhen a harmonic oscillator is subject to a weak perturbation, the energies involved are\nsmall (unless the perturbation is exactly periodic at frequency \u03c90). For a nonlinear oscil-\nlator, on the other hand, a relatively high (resonant) energy may be relevant. The latter\ncondition leads e.g. to the phenomenon of nonlinear resonance [5]. There exists a distinct\nclass of oscillators which, in a sense, combine the highly resonant behaviour characteristic\nof a harmonic oscillator, with the possibility of resonance at high energies that is char-\nacteristic of nonlinear oscillators. These are the oscillators for which \u03c9(E) possesses an\nextremum (Fig. 1(c)): the dispersion at the extremum is equal to zero, i.e.\nd\u03c9(E)\ndE\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nEm\n= 0, (1.0.5)\nso that, in the close vicinity of Em, \u03c9(E) is practically constant. Thus, small variations\nof energy near Em distort the resonance to a much smaller extent than in other energy\nranges or in a conventional nonlinear oscillator where d\u03c9(E)\/dE 6= 0. Such systems were\nidentified as a distinct class by Soskin 1 [6,7]. The title zero-dispersion (ZD) was given to\nthem first by Dykman et al [11], since when it has become conventional in the physics\nliterature. The nomenclature originates from solid state physics terminology (see e.g. the\nbook by Ashcroft and Mermin [12]) where the term \u201cdispersion\u201d means d\u03c9(k)\/dk where\n\u03c9 and k are respectively the frequency and wave number of a phonon 2 .\nWe emphasize that ZD behaviour is not restricted to Hamiltonian systems i.e. to systems\nwhere the conserved quantity is energy. Similar behavior will be valid for a system which\n1 There were also several works by mathematicians on a structure of local chaos in so called\nnonmonotonic twist maps (e.g. [8,9]) or, equivalently, area-preserving nontwist maps (e.g. [10])\nwhich are closely related to periodically driven Hamiltonian systems possessing the property\n(1.0.5). These works will be briefly discussed in Sec. 4 below in relation to periodically-driven\nnon-dissipative ZD systems.\n2 In a sense, zero-dispersion peaks in fluctuation spectra [6,7] are analogous to Van Hove sin-\ngularities [12] in solid state physics.\n5\npossesses any other integral of motion J and for which the eigenfrequency possesses an\nextremum as a function of J . Nonetheless, those ZD systems studied to date have all\nbeen Hamiltonian ones (several examples are considered in Section 2). This review will\nconsequently be restricted to phenomena associated with perturbations of Hamiltonian\nZD systems.\nCommon types of perturbation consist of (i) noise (together with an associated dissipation\n[12,13]), or (ii) a periodic force (with or without dissipation), or (iii) a combination of (i)\nand (ii). Distinctive phenomena occurring in ZD systems under their action are described\nin Sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Such phenomena include: extremely narrow high peaks\n(ZD peaks) in fluctuation spectra, in the presence of noise; a peculiar kind of nonlinear\nresonance, zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR); the onset of deterministic chaos\nat unusually low periodic driving force amplitudes; a characteristic sharp growth of signal-\nto-noise ratio with noise intensity, called the zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (ZDSR),\nand a strong enhancement by noise of subharmonic absorption, when the periodic driving\nforce is weak compared to the added noise; and a strong enhancement of escape from a\npotential well and characteristic features of noise-induced inter-attractor transitions and\na characteristic evolution of fluctuation spectra in the opposite limit, where the noise is\nmuch weaker than the periodic drive. We present in these sections both the theory and\nresults of analogue electronic experiments as well as discussing possible applications.\nThese phenomena all arise in classical systems. The distinct differences in the way one\nwould expect them to manifest themselves in quantum ZD systems are discussed in Section\n6.\nSome concluding remarks are presented in Section 7.\nFinally, the Appendix describes the transformation between coordinate-momentum vari-\nables and energy-angle (or, equivalently, action-angle) variables. The latter are especially\nconvenient in the theoretical consideration of all ZD phenomena because the energy (or,\nequivalently, action) varies only slowly with time, whereas the angle changes fast, and\ntheir separation significantly facilitates the theoretical consideration of the majority of\nZD phenomena.\n2 Examples of models and physical systems displaying zero-dispersion be-\nhaviour\n2.1 Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)\nA radio-frequency SQUID, in common with other more complicated SQUID devices, in-\ncludes [14,15] as a basic element a superconductive loop containing a Josephson junction\n(Fig. 2). The dynamics of the loop may be described in many cases by a resistively-shunted\nmodel, in terms of which the time evolution of the phase of the order parameter, or of the\nmagnetic flux \u03a6 threading the loop, can [14,15] be described by the equation\n6\nLC\nd2q\nd\u03c4 2\n+\nL\nRN\ndq\nd\u03c4\n+ q + \u03b2 sin(q) = qe,\nq = 2pi\n\u03a6\n\u03a60\n, qe = 2pi\n\u03a6e\n\u03a60\n, \u03b2 =\n2piLJc\n\u03a60\n. (2.1.1)\nHere \u03c4 is a real time variable; \u03a6 \u2261 \u03a6(\u03c4) is the full magnetic flux through the loop; \u03a6e is\nthe flux of the external magnetic field; \u03a60 = h\/2e is the flux quantum; L is the inductance\nof the loop; and C,RN and Jc are respectively the capacitance, normal resistivity\n3 and\ncritical supercurrent of the junction.\nIn addition to a constant component \u03a6dc, the external flux often includes a small periodic\nsignal \u03a6s cos(\u03c9s\u03c4) and a noisy component \u03a6N(\u03c4) to which thermal fluctuations within the\nloop itself and noise in the Josephson junction can formally be added (the overall noise\nterm, where present, will for the sake of simplicity be assumed white and of intensity D):\n\u03a6e = \u03a6dc + \u03a6s cos(\u03c9s\u03c4) + \u03a6N(\u03c4), (2.1.2)\n\u3008\u03a6N(\u03c4)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03a6N(\u03c4)\u03a6N(\u03c4 \u2032)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032).\nTaking account of (2.1.2) and introducing the normalised quantities\nt = \u03c9p\u03c4, \u0393 =\n1\n\u03c9pRNC\n, \u2126 =\n\u03c9s\n\u03c9p\n,\nA =\n\u03a6s\nLJc\n, T =\n2piDRN\n\u03a60L2Jc\n, \u03c9p =\n(\n2piJc\nC\u03a60\n)1\/2\n, (2.1.3)\nEq. (2.1.1) takes the form\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 +\ndU\ndq\n= f(t) + A cos(\u2126t) (2.1.4)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032),\nwhere\nU(q) =\nB\n2\n(q \u2212 qe)2 \u2212 cos(q), B \u2261 1\n\u03b2\n. (2.1.5)\nIf the friction, noise and periodic driving amplitude are small they can be neglected in\nthe zeroth-order approximation, and one then derives the unperturbed equation:\nq\u00a8 +\ndU\ndq\n= 0. (2.1.6)\n3 The resistivity may strongly depend on dq\/d\u03c4 , and it may formally include an external shunt.\n7\nIt corresponds to the Hamiltonian\nH(q, p) = U(q) +\np2\n2\n(2.1.7)\nwith the potential U(q) (2.1.5), which may be either single-well (for B\n>\u223c 1: see Fig. 3(a))\nor multi-well (for B\n<\u223c 1: see Fig. 3(b)).\nThe frequency of oscillation in the system (2.1.6) can be calculated from the formula\n\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9(E) = pi\n\uf8eb\uf8ed qr\u222b\nql\ndq\u221a\n2(E \u2212 U(q))\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u22121 , (2.1.8)\nwhere ql and qr are the left and right turning points at a given E (and in a given potential\nwell if the energy level E exists in more than one well), i.e. the relevant roots of the\nequation\nE = U(q). (2.1.9)\nThe function \u03c9(E) possesses extrema, which are most pronounced if B \u223c 1: see Fig. 4.\nConsequently, the system (2.1.5)-(2.1.6) is a ZD system.\n2.2 2D electron gas in a magnetic superlattice, axial molecules\nOur example from the previous sub-section, the multi-well SQUID, belongs to a more\ngeneral class of systems possessing the ZD property. These are the systems that possess\ntwo or more separatrices: the time of motion along any separatrix is infinite, so that\nthe frequency of eigenoscillation for each of the energies (or any other relevant integral\nof motion) corresponding to the separatrices is zero. The frequency must therefore pass\nthrough a maximum somewhere in between these energies. In particular, it may be a multi-\nbarrier potential system in which the tops of at least two of the barriers have different\npotential energies. Apart from SQUIDs, such a situation is typical of periodic potentials\nthat have two or more barriers within the period.\nWe now consider briefly two examples of such physical systems. The first is a 2D elec-\ntron gas in a magnetic superlattice (see e.g. [16,17]). In some cases, e.g. in a thin layer\nof semiconductor where the electrons are of high mobility, the motion of electrons along\nthe layer can be considered as a two-dimensional motion of non-interacting classical par-\nticles [18\u201321]. If a magnetic field\n\u2192\nH perpendicular to the layer is added, and periodicaly\nmodulated in some direction along the layer,\n\u2192\nH\u2261 (Hx,Hy,Hz), Hx = Hy = 0, Hz = H0 cos(kx), (2.2.1)\n8\nthen the motion of an electron is described by the Hamiltonian [22]\nHmagnetic \u2261 Hmagnetic(x, y, px, py) = (\n\u2192\np \u2212 e\nc\n\u2192\nA)2\n2m\u2217\n, (2.2.2)\nwhere\n\u2192\nA is the vector-potential (\n\u2192\nH\u2261 curl \u2192A), \u2192p\u2261 (px, py), e and m\u2217 are respectively the\ncharge and the effective mass of the electron, and c is the velocity of light. For the field\n(2.2.1),\n\u2192\nA may be chosen in such a way that [20,21]\nHmagnetic =\np2x\n2m\u2217\n+\n(py \u2212 ecH0k\u22121 sin(kx))2\n2m\u2217\n. (2.2.3)\nThe Hamiltonian (2.2.3) does not depend on y: hence, py = const, and the motion in\nthe x-direction is separated as one-dimensional Hamiltonian motion (1.0.1) with q, p, t\nrepresenting normalized (dimensionless) coordinate, momentum and time respectively,\nq \u2261 kx, p \u2261 px k\nm\u2217\u03c9c\n, t \u2261 \u03c9c\u03c4, \u03c9c = eH0\nm\u2217c\n, (2.2.4)\nand the Hamiltonian is of the potential type:\nH(q, p) = U(q) +\np2\n2\n, (2.2.5)\nwith potential\nU(q) =\n1\n2\n(\u03a6\u2212 sin(q))2, \u03a6 \u2261 pykc\neH0\n. (2.2.6)\nThe potential (2.2.6) is periodic. If \u03a6 < 1, it possesses two barriers within the period,\nof different heights (Fig. 5(a)). Correspondingly, the frequency of oscillation \u03c9 possesses\na local maximum as a function of energy E (Fig. 5(c)). If \u03a6 > 1, then there is only\none barrier within the period (Fig. 5(b)), but \u03c9(E) can still be shown to possess a local\nmaximum provided \u03a6 < 4 (Fig. 5(d)). Thus, if \u03a6 < 4, the system (2.2.5)-(2.2.6) possesses\nthe zero-dispersion property (1.0.5). One may induce a perturbation by e.g. perturbing\nthe magnetic field or applying an electric field along the layer [20,21].\nAnother example which may be described by a periodic potential with more than one\nbarrier within the period relates to torsional motion within a complex axial molecule\n(Fig. 6). If such a complex molecule has a rigid axis then an atom (or a group of atoms)\nbeyond the axis may have a few equilibrium positions lying in the plane perpendicular\nto the axis. The motion of such an atom (group of atoms), often called an isomerisation\nprocess [23], may sometimes be considered as an underdamped rotation in the plane (cf.\n[23,24]), which, neglecting damping and other weak interactions with the surroundings,\nmay be described as Hamiltonian motion in a periodic potential with a few non-equal\nbarriers, thus again providing for the zero-dispersion property.\n9\n2.3 Electrical circuits, particle accelerators, impurities in solids: tilted Duffing oscillator\nOne of the simplest and at the same time non-trivial ZD models is the tilted Duffing\noscillator (TDO) [11] which may be considered as a conventional Duffing oscillator [1]\nthat is subject to a constant force (which is what leads to the tilt of the Duffing potential):\nq\u00a8 +\ndU\ndq\n= 0, U(q) =\n\u03c920q\n2\n2\n+\n\u03b3q4\n4\n+ Aq, \u03b3 > 0. (2.3.1)\nThe potential U(q) (2.3.1) is an asymmetric single well (Fig.7(a)). If |A| exceeds Acr =\n8\u03c920\/(7\n\u221a\n7\u03b3), then \u03c9(E) possesses a minimum [11] (Fig. 7(b)).\nThe TDO model may be related to e.g. an oscillatory electrical circuit with a battery [25]\n(Fig. 8). The charge q on the capacitance obeys the equation\nq\nC\n= \u000f\u2212 Ld\n2q\ndt2\n, (2.3.2)\nwhere C is the capacitance, L is the inductance and \u000f is the battery emf; \u000f and L are\ntypically constants. Real capacitors are non-ideal, and the stored charge q is not quite\nproportional to the potential difference. In many cases, the growth of q with voltage is\nweaker than linear, and is independent of the sign of the voltage, which means that C\nis a decreasing function of q2. At small enough q, it may typically be approximated as\nC = C0\/(1 + \u03b1q\n2) where C0 and \u03b1 are constants; thus Eq. (2.3.2) reduces to Eq. (2.3.1).\nA possible small resistance in the circuit, weak Nyquist noise, periodic signals, etc. may\nbe considered as perturbations.\nThe TDO model may also be relevant to rf acceleration in particle accelerators [26] and to\nlocal and resonant vibrations in certain doped crystals [27] when a constant homogeneous\nelectric field or external pressure are applied to the crystal.\nIt should be noted that the linear term in the TDO potential U(q) (2.3.1) can be converted\nto a cubic term by a change of origin to the equilibrium position determined by dU\/dq = 0\ni.e. by a root of the equation\n\u03b3q3eq + \u03c9\n2\n0qeq + A = 0. (2.3.3)\nIndeed,\nU(q) \u2261 U(qeq) +\n\u03c920 + 3\u03b3q\n2\neq\n2\n(q \u2212 qeq)2 + \u03b3qeq(q \u2212 qeq)3 + \u03b3(q \u2212 qeq)\n4\n4\n. (2.3.4)\nSuch a presentation of the potential is usually more convenient for the analysis. In partic-\nular, by using it, one can easily show that the ratio of the maximal decrease of eigenfre-\nquency (as energy varies from the bottom to the energy corresponding to the minimum\n10\nin \u03c9(E)) to the eigenfrequency in the bottom is rather small for a potential of the type\n(2.3.1) (cf. Fig. 7(b)), even at large A.\nAt the same time, the potential with a cubic nonlinearity,\nU(q) =\n\u03c920q\n2\n2\n+\n\u03b2q3\n3\n+\n\u03b3q4\n4\n, (2.3.5)\n9\n10\n<\n\u03b22\n\u03b3\u03c920\n< 4,\npermits any depth of minimum in \u03c9(E) (cf. Fig. 9). An oscillator with the potential (2.3.5)\nis therefore also referred to as a tilted Duffing oscillator and it will be used extensively in\nthis review as a simple characteristic model 4 .\nFinally, we present in this sub-section an explicit expression for \u03c9(E) [11]:\n\u03c9(E) =\npi\n2K(k)\n(\n1\n2\nz(1)z(2)\n) 1\n2\n, (2.3.6)\nk2 =\n1\n4\n(q(1) \u2212 q(2))2 \u2212 (z(1) \u2212 z(2))2\nz(1)z(2)\n,\nz(j) = [(q(3) \u2212 q(j))(q(4) \u2212 q(j))] 12 , j = 1, 2,\nwhere K(k) is a full elliptic integral of the first kind and k is its modulus; q(1), q(2) are\nreal roots and q(3), q(4) \u2261 q(3)\u2217 are complex conjugate roots of the equation\nU(q(n) + qeq)\u2212 U(qeq)\u2212 E = 0; (2.3.7)\nn = 1, ..., 4; q(1) > q(2),\nwhere U(q) is given either by (2.3.1) or by (2.3.5) while qeq is given by (2.3.3) or equal to\nzero respectively.\n2.4 Relativistic oscillators\nA one-dimensional relativistic oscillator can be described as a Hamiltonian system with\nthe following Hamiltonian [28]\nH(q, p) =\n\u221a\np2c2 +m2c4 + U(q), (2.4.1)\n4 It should be noted that, apart from being a convenient model for theoretical studies, the\npotential (2.3.5) may also serve as an approximation for a variety of real systems.\n11\nwhere c is the velocity of light and m is a mass.\nAt a given energy E, the system oscillates between the turning points ql and qr which are\nthe relevant roots of the equation\nE = mc2 + U(q). (2.4.2)\nThe frequency of oscillation is described by the formula [28]\n\u03c9(E) = pic\n\uf8eb\uf8ed qr\u222b\nql\nE \u2212 U(q)\u221a\n(E \u2212 U(q))2 \u2212m2c4\ndq\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u22121 . (2.4.3)\nIf E \u2212mc2 \u001c mc2, then |p|\/m\u001c c, so that the Hamiltonian reduces to\nHnonrel(q, p) = mc\n2 +\np2\n2m\n+ U(q), (2.4.4)\nE \u2212mc2 \u001c mc2,\nand the dynamics reduces to non-relativistic potential motion (cf. (2.1.6), (2.1.7)). In\nparticular, \u03c9(E) is described by a non-relativistic formula similar to (2.1.8) (in which E\nshould be replaced by E \u2212mc2 while the right-hand side should be divided by \u221am).\nIn the opposite (strongly relativistic) limit, E \u2212mc2 \u001d mc2, the Hamiltonian reduces to\nHrel(q, p) = |p|c+ U(q), (2.4.5)\nE \u2212mc2 \u001d mc2,\nwhich corresponds to a constant modulus of velocity during the motion 5 , q\u02d9 = \u00b1c, so that\nthe period of oscillation is equal just to 2(qr \u2212 ql)\/c and, given that the distance between\nturning points grows with E if E is large enough (unless the potential has infinite vertical\nwalls), \u03c9(E) is a decreasing function at large enough E:\n\u03c9(E) \u2248 pic\nqr \u2212 ql\nE\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 0. (2.4.6)\nThus, if the potential U(q) provides in the non-relativistic regime an increase of \u03c9(E) in\nsome range of energies E\u2212mc2 \u001c mc2 (for example, a Duffing oscillator, both single-well\nand double-well, provides an increasing \u03c9(E) at E exceeding certain values [2,29,28]),\n5 Obviously, Eq. (2.4.5) is not valid in the close vicinity of turning points, but this has little\neffect on the period of the motion, which is the main quantity of interest for us in the present\ncontext.\n12\nthen \u03c9(E) (2.4.3) necessarily possesses a local maximum at some energy in the transition\nrange between the non-relativistic and relativistic limits (cf. Fig. 10). The system therefore\nmanifests zero-dispersion properties [30,31].\nIt should be noted also that zero-dispersion phenomena may be expected to occur, not\nonly in the simple model relativistic systems considered above, but also in certain more\ncomplicated relativistic systems such as driven electron plasma waves [32] and periodically\nfocused intense beams of charged particles [33].\n2.5 The Harper oscillator\nThe kicked Harper model [34] is defined by the time-dependent Hamiltonian\nH(I, \u03c8, t) = \u2212V0 cos(2piI)\u2212 V1 cos(2pi\u03c8)K(t), (2.5.1)\nK(t) = \u03c4\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(t\u2212 n\u03c4),\nwhere I and \u03c8 may be considered e.g. as action and angle respectively [1] and t is time.\nThis model may in some cases be related to real physical systems, e.g., at V0 = V1, it serves\nas an approximation for a kicked charge in a magnetic field [35]. More often, however, it\nis used in theoretical and numerical studies of chaos, being a simple system manifesting\nvery rich chaotic behaviour, both in the classical and quantum cases (see e.g. [36,37] and\nreferences therein). We shall explore the non-symmetric case\nV1 \u001c V0. (2.5.2)\nIn the zeroth-order approximation, the term \u221d V1 may then be omitted and we derive the\nHamiltonian\nH0 \u2261 H0(I) = \u2212V0 cos(2piI), (2.5.3)\nwhich does not depend on angle \u03c8. Therefore, the system (2.5.3) is integrable: the action\nI is a constant of motion while the angle \u03c8 oscillates with the frequency [1,35]\n\u03c9 =\ndH0\ndI\n= 2piV0 sin(2piI). (2.5.4)\nAs a function of action, \u03c9 (2.5.4) possesses extrema at\nI = In \u2261 n+ 1\n2\n,\nn= 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, ...,\n13\nwhere the derivative is equal to zero, d\u03c9(In)\/dIn = 0. Obviously, the derivative with re-\nspect to energy E \u2261 H0(I) also equals zero at En \u2261 H0(In): d\u03c9\/dE|En = (\u03c9|En)\u22121d\u03c9\/dI|In =\n0.\nThus, the zeroth-order approximation (2.5.3) of the Harper model possesses the zero-\ndispersion property. The kicking (the periodic perturbation term \u221d V1 in (2.5.1)) leads to\nnonlinear resonances, and to associated chaos, which may be especially pronounced under\ncertain conditions related to the zero-dispersion property (see Sec. 4).\n3 Zero-dispersion systems subject to noise: zero-dispersion peaks in fluctua-\ntion spectra\n3.1 Basic equations\nFor the sake of clarity, we shall consider in this section, as an example of a noise-driven\nZD system, a one-dimensional ZD system of the potential type subject to a linear friction\nand white noise:\nq\u02d9 = p, p\u02d9 = \u2212\u0393q\u02d9 \u2212 dU\/dq + f(t),\n(3.1.1)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032).\nInstead of the Langevin description (3.1.1), one may use a description in terms of the\ntime evolution of the probability density in a phase space, W (p, q, t|p0, q0), i.e. the density\nof probability of the coordinate and momentum being equal to q and p respectively, at a\ngiven instant t, if at the initial time they were equal to q0 and p0. In the case of white\nnoise, W obeys the Fokker-Plank equation (FPE) [38]\n\u2202W\n\u2202t\n= \u2212p\u2202W\n\u2202q\n+\ndU\ndq\n\u2202W\n\u2202p\n+ \u0393\n\u2202\n\u2202p\n(\np+ T\n\u2202\n\u2202p\n)\nW (3.1.2)\nwith the initial condition\nW (p, q, 0|p0, q0) = \u03b4(p\u2212 p0)\u03b4(q \u2212 q0). (3.1.3)\nThe stationary solution of the FPE (3.1.2) is the Gibbsian distribution [13,38]\nWst(p, q) = Z\n\u22121 exp(\u2212E\/T ), (3.1.4)\nZ =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndp\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndq exp(\u2212E\/T ), E = U(q) + p2\/2.\n14\nThus, T plays the role of temperature (even if the noise is of a non-thermal nature), and\nit will be referred to as such in what follows.\nIn many problems, the quantity of interest is the spectrum of fluctuations of a given\n(real-valued) function of dynamical variables, \u03d5(q, p) [13,38]\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) =\n1\n2pi\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt exp(\u2212i\u2126t)R\u03d5(t) \u2261 1\npi\nRe\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt exp(\u2212i\u2126t)R\u03d5(t)\n\uf8f9\uf8fb , (3.1.5)\nR\u03d5(t) \u2261 \u3008(\u03d5(t)\u2212 \u3008\u03d5\u3009)(\u03d5(0)\u2212 \u3008\u03d5\u3009)\u3009, \u03d5(t) \u2261 \u03d5(q(t), p(t)),\nwhere the brackets \u3008...\u3009 denote averaging both over the equilibrium ensemble (3.1.4) and\nover realizations of the random force f(t), i.e. respectively over the initial and final states,\nin the phase space.\nThe fluctuation spectrum is an important physical quantity which can be determined\ndirectly in an experiment. For example, if q is the coordinate of an electrically charged\nparticle, then the spectrum of the classical radiation is proportional to \u21264Qq(\u2126) [22].\nThe spectral dependence of the mobility of charged particles is determined by \u21262Qq(\u2126)\n[38]. The polarizability of a rotating dipole is proportional to the spectrum of the time-\nderivative of the correlation function of the corresponding superposition of the sine and\ncosine of the angle [39]. In some cases, Q\u03d5(\u2126) may characterize the combination scat-\ntering spectrum (in this case, \u03d5 is a complicated function of coordinate and momentum\n[40]). There are also many other physical quantities which may be described in terms of\nfluctuation spectra [38].\nIt will be convenient to transform from (q, p) to the energy\u2013angle representation (E,\u03c8)\n[1]\nE = U(q) +\np2\n2\n, \u03c8 =\n\u222b\ndq\n\u03c9(E)\u221a\n2(E \u2212 U(q))\n, (3.1.6)\nsince, at small friction (relevant to ZD phenomena), energy is a slow variable whereas the\nangle is a fast one, so that their dynamics are well separated.\nAllowing for the periodicity of \u03d5 in \u03c8,\n\u03d5(q, p) \u2261 \u03d5\u02dc(E,\u03c8) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03d5n(E)e\n\u2212in\u03c8, \u03d5\u2212n = \u03d5\u2217n, (3.1.7)\none may present the correlation function R\u03d5(t) (3.1.5) as\nR\u03d5(t) =\n\u221e\u222b\nUmin\ndE0\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c80 W\u02dcst(E0, \u03c80)(\u3008\u03d5\u02dc(t)\u3009E0,\u03c80 \u2212 \u3008\u03d5\u02dc\u3009)(\u3008\u03d5\u02dc(E0, \u03c80)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03d5\u02dc\u3009), (3.1.8)\n15\nUmin \u2261 min{U(q)},\nwhere\nW\u02dcst(E0, \u03c80) =\nWst(p0, q0)\n\u03c9(E0)\n=\nexp(\u2212E0\/T )\n\u03c9(E0)Z\n(3.1.9)\nis a stationary distribution in the energy-angle space, while\n\u3008\u03d5\u02dc(t)\u3009E0,\u03c80 \u2261\n\u221e\u222b\nUmin\ndE\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c8 \u03d5\u02dc(E,\u03c8)W\u02dc (E,\u03c8, t|E0, \u03c80), (3.1.10)\nwhere W\u02dc = W\/\u03c9(E) is the conditional probability density in the E\u2212\u03c8 space normalized\nto a 2pi-band of \u03c8.\n3.2 Zero-frequency-limit\nIn the zero-friction approximation, energy is conserved whereas the angle changes with a\nconstant speed \u03c9(E), so that\nW\u02dc (E,\u03c8, t|E0, \u03c80) = \u03b4(E \u2212 E0)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 \u2212 \u03c9(E0)t+ 2pin). (3.2.1)\nSubstituting (3.2.1) into (3.1.10), putting the resulting expression and (3.1.9) into (3.1.8),\none obtains for the spectrum (3.1.5) at a non-zero frequency\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) \u2248 Q(0)\u03d5 (\u2126) \u2261\n2pi\nZ\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2211\nj\n1\nn\n[\nexp(\u2212E\/T )\n\u03c9(E)\n|\u03d5n(E)|2 1|d\u03c9(E)\/dE|\n]\nE=Ej(\u2126\/n)\n,\n\u2126 6= 0, (3.2.2)\nwhere the Ej(\u2126\/n) are determined from the equation\n\u03c9(Ej(\u2126\/n)) = \u2126\/n, (3.2.3)\nand the summation over j in (3.2.2) denotes a summation over all the roots of Eq. (3.2.3).\nNear the extremum, \u03c9(E) takes the form\n\u03c9(E) = \u2126m +\n1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032(E \u2212 Em)2, \u03c9\u2032\u2032 \u2261 d\n2\u03c9(Em)\ndE2m\n. (3.2.4)\n16\nThus, the solutions of Eq. (3.2.3) can be written\nE1,2(\n\u2126\nn\n) \u2248 Em \u00b1\n\u221a\n2(\n\u2126\nn\n\u2212 \u2126m)\/\u03c9\u2032\u2032, \u03c9\u2032\u2032(\u2126\nn\n\u2212 \u2126m) > 0.

Before embarking on a rig-\norous analysis, we present some simple qualitative estimates relevant to the ZDP at the\nfundamental frequency, which will facilitate understanding of the rigorous results.\n3.3.1 Qualitative estimates\nLet us estimate the correlation time tc for an oscillator whose initial energy E0 is close\nto Em. It may be found approximately from the condition that the diffusion of angle has\nattained \u223c pi:\n\u2206\u03c8(tc) \u223c pi. (3.3.1)\nAngular diffusion is due to the diffusion of energy, \u2206E, which leads to a diffusion of \u03c9(E),\nleading in turn to the diffusion of \u03c8\u02d9 \u2248 \u03c9(E):\n\u2206\u03c8\u02d9 \u223c |\u03c9(E0 \u00b1\u2206E(t))\u2212 \u03c9(E0)| \u223c |\u03c9\u2032\u2032\u2206E(t)(2(E0 \u2212 Em)\u00b1\u2206E(t))|. (3.3.2)\nThe diffusion of energy \u2206E(t) \u2248 (Tp2\u0393t)1\/2 where the overbar denotes an averaging\nover one period of eigenoscillation 2pi\/\u03c9(E0) (cf. [38]). Consider first an E0 such that\n6 Note that there were some misprints in [7]. In particular, in Eq. (2.35) (which is the major\nresult of [7]: it describes the asymptotic shape of ZDP), the factor\n\u221a\n2 was missed in the scaling\nfactor A.\n17\n|E0 \u2212 Em| <\u223c \u2206E(tc). Then, \u2206\u03c8\u02d9(tc) \u223c |\u03c9\u2032\u2032|(\u2206E(tc))2, while\n\u2206\u03c8(tc) \u223c \u2206\u03c8\u02d9(tc)tc \u223c |\u03c9\u2032\u2032|Tp2t2c . (3.3.3)\nComparing (3.3.3) with (3.3.1), we conclude that, if |E0 \u2212 Em| <\u223c (Tp2\u0393\/|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|)1\/4, then\ntc \u223c (|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|Tp2\u0393)\u22121\/2.\nIf, on the other hand, |E0 \u2212 Em| \u001d (Tp2\u0393\/|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|)1\/4, then \u2206E(tc) \u001c |E0 \u2212 Em|, so that\n(3.3.2) reduces to \u2206\u03c8\u02d9(tc) \u223c |\u03c9\u2032\u2032|\u2206E(tc)|E0 \u2212Em|. Comparing \u2206\u03c8(tc) \u223c \u2206\u03c8\u02d9(tc)tc with pi,\nwe conclude that tc \u001c (|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|Tp2\u0393)\u22121\/2 for such E0 and, therefore, that the contribution of\nsuch energies to the formation of the spectrum at \u2126 \u2248 \u2126m may be neglected.\nThus, we have found the characteristic scales of time and energy relevant to the ZDP:\ntzdp = (|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|Tp2m\u0393)\u22121\/2 \u221d \u0393\u22121\/2, (3.3.4)\np2m \u2261 p2(Em),\n\u2206Ezdp \u2261 \u2206E(tzdp) = (Tp2m\u0393\/|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|)1\/4 \u221d \u03931\/4. (3.3.5)\nThe time scale tzdp characterizes the decay time for oscillations of frequency \u2248 \u2126m. Thus,\nthe width of the ZDP should be\n\u2206\u2126zdp \u223c t\u22121zdp =\n\u221a\n|\u03c9\u2032\u2032|Tp2m\u0393 \u221d\n\u221a\n\u0393. (3.3.6)\nThe energy scale \u2206Ezdp characterizes the width of the energy band contributing to the\nformation of the ZDP. It follows from (3.1.5) and (3.1.8) that the magnitude of the ZDP\nQ\u03d5(\u2126m) \u223c 1\nZ\u03c9m\nexp(\u2212Em\nT\n)|\u03d51(Em)|2\u2206Ezdptzdp \u221d 1\n\u03931\/4\n. (3.3.7)\nThe qualitative estimates (3.3.6),(3.3.7) are confirmed by the rigorous analysis presented\nbelow.\n3.3.2 Rigorous asymptotic theory\nAs already mentioned, it is convenient to transform from (p, q) to (E,\u03c8) variables. The\ncorresponding dynamical equations are given in the Appendix: see Eq. (A.15). The FPE\n[38] for W\u02dc (E,\u03c8, t|E0, \u03c80) can be written as\n\u2202W\u02dc\n\u2202t\n=\u2212\u03c9(E)\u2202W\u02dc\n\u2202\u03c8\n+ \u0393\u02c6\u02dcLW\u02dc , (3.3.8)\n\u02c6\u02dcL=\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202E\n[\n\u2212p2 + T (ppE \u2212 \u03c9(E)qEp\u03c8)\n]\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202\u03c8\nT\n[\n\u03c92(E)qEqE\u03c8 \u2212 p \u2202\n\u2202E\n(\u03c9(E)qE)\n]\n+\n18\n\u22022\n\u2202E2\nTp2 \u2212 2 \u2202\n2\n\u2202E\u2202\u03c8\nT\u03c9(E)qEp+\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03c82\nT\u03c92(E)q2E,\nwhere the subscripts E,\u03c8 denote the corresponding partial derivatives.\nThe initial condition for W\u02dc is\nW\u02dc (E,\u03c8, 0|E0, \u03c80) = \u03b4(E \u2212 E0)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 + 2pin). (3.3.9)\nIn view of its periodicity in \u03c8, W\u02dc can be expanded in a Fourier series. It is convenient to\nwrite explicitly the \u201cdissipationless\u201d factor exp{in[\u03c80 + \u03c9(E0)t]} in Fourier coefficients,\nW\u02dc =\n\u2211\nn\nWn exp{\u2212in[\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c80 \u2212 \u03c9(E0)t]}. (3.3.10)\nIn the zero-friction limit (\u0393 = 0), the coefficients Wn do not depend on time: Wn(\u0393 = 0) =\n\u03b4(E \u2212E0)\/(2pi). At a small (but non-zero) \u0393, Wn varies with time slowly as compared to\n[n\u03c9(E)]\u22121 at n 6= 0 or to \u03c9\u22121(E) at n = 0 (which is, of course, confirmed by the result).\nTherefore, substituting (3.3.10) into the FPE (3.3.8), one may drop fast-oscillating terms,\nin accordance with the averaging method [41], so that\n\u2202Wn\n\u2202t\n= in[\u03c9(E)\u2212 \u03c9(E0)]Wn (3.3.11)\n+\u0393\n{\n\u2202\n\u2202E\np2\n[(\n1 + T\nd\u03c9(E)\/dE\n\u03c9(E)\n)\nWn + T\n\u2202Wn\n\u2202E\n]\n\u2212 n2T\u03c92(E)q2EWn\n}\n.\nFor n = 0, Eq. (3.3.11) coincides with the well-known Kramers equation [42] . For n = 1,\nin the case of the Duffing oscillator, Eq. (3.3.11) may be reduced to the FPE obtained in\n[43].\nTransforming to the dimensionless variables\nt\u02dc =\nt\ntzdp\n,\n(3.3.12)\nE\u02dc =\nE \u2212 Em\n\u2206Ezdp\n,\nintroducing the parameter\nE\u02dc0 =\nE0 \u2212 Em\n\u2206Ezdp\n, (3.3.13)\n19\nand omitting all terms which, at the relevant unit \u201ctimes\u201d t\u02dc and \u201cenergies\u201d E\u02dc, E\u02dc0, tend\nto zero as 7 \u0393\u2192 0, we obtain an asymptotic equation for Wn:\n\u2202Wn\n\u2202t\u02dc\n=\n1\n2\nin sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032)(E\u02dc2 \u2212 E\u02dc20)Wn +\n\u22022Wn\n\u2202E\u02dc2\n. (3.3.14)\nThe initial condition is:\nWn\nt\u02dc\u21920\u2212\u2192 \u03b4(E\u02dc \u2212 E\u02dc0)\n2pi\u2206Ezdp\n. (3.3.15)\nAn equation similar to (3.3.14) (but without the imaginary i) was obtained in quantum\nstatistical mechanics in relation to the density matrix of the harmonic oscillator [44].\nUsing the substitution\nWn = exp[a(t\u02dc)E\u02dc\n2 + b(t\u02dc)E\u02dc + c(t\u02dc)], (3.3.16)\nwe obtain for a, b, c the set of ordinary differential equations,\nda\ndt\u02dc\n=\n1\n2\nin sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032) + 4a2,\ndb\ndt\u02dc\n= 4ab, (3.3.17)\ndc\ndt\u02dc\n= \u22121\n2\ninx20 sgn(\u03c9\n\u2032\u2032) + b2 + 2a,\nwhich can be solved explicitly, so that Wn satisfying the initial condition (3.3.15) reads\nWn =\n1\n\u2206E\nexp\n[\n\u2212\u03bbn(E\u02dc\u2212E\u02dc0sech(\u03bbn t\u02dc))2\n4th(\u03bbn t\u02dc)\n\u2212 E\u02dc20\u03bbnth(\u03bbn t\u02dc)\n4\n\u2212 inE\u02dc20sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032)t\u02dc\n2\n]\n4pi\n\u221a\npi sh(\u03bbnt\u02dc)\/\u03bbn\n,\n\u03bbn =\n\u221a\nn sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032)(1\u2212 i), n 6= 0. (3.3.18)\nThe solution vanishes exponentially sharply as t\u02dc or |E\u02dc \u2212 E\u02dc0| grow \u001d 1; if |E\u02dc0| \u001d 1, then\nWn oscillates rapidly with t\u02dc even at |t\u02dc|, |E\u02dc \u2212 E\u02dc0| \u223c 1. This confirms our original inference\nthat, in the asymptotic limit \u0393 \u2192 0, the ZDP is dominated by an infinitesimal band of\nenergies around Em.\n7 The upper limit on \u0393 for which the asymptotic results obtained in this sub-section are valid\ndepends on temperature and on other parameters. This dependence will be derived explicitly in\nthe next sub-section.\n20\nSubstituting Wn (3.3.18) into W\u02dc (3.3.10), putting W\u02dc into \u3008\u03d5\u02dc(t)\u3009E0,\u03c80 (3.1.10), substitut-\ning the latter into the correlation function (3.1.8), calculating its Fourier transform and\nomitting all terms which vanish as \u0393\u2192 0, we obtain for the asymptotic shape of the ZDP\n(see [7] for details; note however footnote 6 above)\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) = CscaleS(\u2206\u2126\u02dcn), (3.3.19)\nCscale =\n4\n\u221a\npi | \u03d5n(Em) |2 exp(\u2212Em\/T )\n\u03c9m(| \u03c9\u2032\u2032 |)3\/4Z(\u0393Tp2m)1\/4\n,\n\u2206\u2126\u02dcn = sgn(\u03c9\n\u2032\u2032)(\u2126\u2212 n\u2126m)tzdp\/\n\u221a\nn, |\u2126\u2212 n\u2126m| \u001c \u2126m, n = 1, 2, 3, ...,\nS(x) = |Re[Sc(x)]| ,\nSc(x) =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4\nexp(\u2212ix\u03c4)\u221a\n(1\u2212 i) sh[(1\u2212 i)\u03c4 ]\n.\nThe universal function S(x) is easily calculated numerically 8 (see Fig. 11). It has the\nshape of an asymmetric peak with a maximum at xm \u2248 0.61 (S(xm) \u2248 2.5) and a width\n\u223c 1. The shift of the maximum to the right relative to the x = 0 value (corresponding to\nfrequency n\u2126m) for the value \u223c 1 is due to the fact that \u2126m is the boundary frequency\nof the spectrum of eigenfrequencies while, over the major part of the time relevant to\nformation of the peak, the system has such energy that \u03c9(E) is shifted from \u2126m for\n\u223c sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032)(\u221antzdp)\u22121.\nAt |x| \u001d 1, only small \u03c4 contribute to the integral, so that\nS(x) \u2248\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4\ncos(x\u03c4) + sin(x\u03c4)\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c4\n=\n\u221a\npi\n2x\nat x>0,\n0 at x<0, (3.3.20)\n|x| \u001d 1.\nThus, Q\u03d5(\u2126) (3.3.19) reduces at |\u2206\u2126\u02dcn| \u001d 1 to the zero-friction expression (3.2.6).\nThe expression (3.3.19) also confirms the qualitative estimates (3.3.6) and (3.3.7), for the\nZDP\u2019s width and magnitude respectively.\n3.4 Asymptotic theory of the ZDP evolution with temperature\nThe formula (3.3.19) describes the spectrum near n\u2126m in the asymptotic limit \u0393\u2192 0; but\nwhat would happen if, at a small but fixed \u0393, the temperature became smaller than \u2206Ezdp?\nIt is intuitively obvious that the spectrum must change, both because the statistical\ndistribution within the relevant band of energies becomes strongly inhomogeneous and\n8 In doing so, one should bear in mind that the argument of the complex expression under the\nradical in the integrand should vary continuously (from \u2212pi\/2 to \u2212\u221e) as \u03c4 increases.\n21\nbecause the influence of the drift of energy on the correlation function during the relevant\ninterval tzdp becomes comparable with the influence of the diffusion. And, indeed, the\nexperimental results obtained in [11] show that, when the spectrum near \u2126m is starting\nto grow exponentially with temperature, it takes (for the given parameters) the form of\na step rather than of a peak, and only gradually transforms into a peak with further\nincrease of temperature. In other works (see e.g. [45\u201347]), which explored different sets\nof parameters or different models, the evolution varied: in some cases, the exponentially\ngrowing spectrum near n\u2126m had a distinct peak-like shape from its very first manifestation\non the background of a low plateau (cf. the right inset in Fig. 17(a)) while, in other cases,\nthe initial shape was either a step followed by a monotonic growth (cf. Fig. 15(c)) or\na step leading to a slight decrease followed by significant growth (cf. Fig. 16(a)). The\nwhole diverse range of evolutions is nicely described by numerical calculations based on\nthe algorithm suggested in [11] and generalized in [47]. However, it is also important to\nobtain explicit results to reveal the mechanisms responsible for different types of evolution.\nThis problem was solved in [48]. Moreover, the universal nature of the relevant part of the\nspectral evolution has been demonstrated in analogue experiments [46]: the evolution is\ndescribed by universal function, and the variety of different evolutions mentioned above\nresults merely from different arguments of this universal function as well as from different\nscaling factors. We review below the major results of [48].\nWe now introduce two new parameters:\nE\u02dcm \u2261 Em \u2212 Umin\n\u2206Ezdp\n\u221d 1\n(\u0393T )1\/4\n, (3.4.1)\n\u03b3 \u2261 \u2206Ezdp\nT\n\u221d 1\nT 3\/4\n. (3.4.2)\nNote that the ratio of the drift of energy near Em, \u2206Edrift(t) \u2248 \u0393p2mt, to the diffusion of\nenergy, \u2206Edif(t) \u2248 (\u0393p2mTt)1\/2, grows with time,\n\u2206Edrift\n\u2206Edif\n= \u03b3\n\u221a\nt\ntzdp\n, (3.4.3)\nand reaches the value \u03b3 precisely at t = tzdp.\nThe product \u03b3E\u02dcm \u2261 (Em \u2212 Umin)\/T determines the statistical weight of the energy Em,\nWst(E0 = Em) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b3E\u02dcm). It is obvious that, if \u03b3E\u02dcm is large enough, the contribution\nof energies E \u2248 Em is negligible in comparison with the contribution from E \u2248 Umin. At\nthe same time, the characteristic (step-like or similar) shape of the spectrum near \u2126m is\npossible only if \u03b3 \u223c 1, as follows from (3.4.3). On the other hand, it is obvious that the\nZDP may be resolved in the spectrum only if\nE\u02dcm \u001d 1. (3.4.4)\nThus, an important feature of the problem is that we should work down to temperatures\nthat are small enough for \u03b3 to be \u223c 1 (so that the effect of drift is comparable with that\n22\nof diffusion) but large enough for Wst(E0 = Em) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b3E\u02dcm) not to be negligible. The\nexperimental existence of a step-like (or similar) shape of spectrum constitutes evidence\nthat such a range of temperatures does exist, and the theoretical considerations below\nconfirm this inference.\nThus, we shall consider the case of \u03b3\n\u223c\n< 1 (which corresponds to T\n\u223c\n> (\u0393p2\/\u03c9\u2032\u2032)1\/3).\nTransforming the reduced FPE (3.3.11) to a dimensionless equation, we shall keep the\ndrift term (\u221d \u03b3) while omitting all terms \u221d E\u02dc\u2212km with k \u2265 1:\n\u2202Wn\n\u2202t\u02dc\n=\n1\n2\nin sgn(\u03c9\u2032\u2032)(E\u02dc2 \u2212 E\u02dc20)Wn + \u03b3\n\u2202Wn\n\u2202E\u02dc\n+\n\u22022Wn\n\u2202E\u02dc2\n. (3.4.5)\nThe explicit solution for Wn (with the same initial condition as before: see Eq. (3.3.15))\ncan be obtained in a similar manner to the case for \u03b3 = 0 described in the previous\nsub-section (though it is more cumbersome). But the evaluation of the spectrum is more\ncomplicated.\nLet us present the spectrum in the following form:\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) \u2261\n\u221e\u222b\nUmin\ndE0 Q\n(partial)\n\u03d5 (E0,\u2126) \u2261\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212E\u02dcm\ndE\u02dc0 Q\u02dc\n(partial)\n\u03d5 (E\u02dc0,\u2126), (3.4.6)\nwhere\nQ(partial)\u03d5 (E0,\u2126) =\n1\npi\nRe\n( \u221e\u222b\n0\ndt e\u2212i\u2126t\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c80 Wst(E0, \u03c80)[\u3008\u03d5\u02dc(t)\u3009E0,\u03c80\n\u2212\u3008\u03d5\u02dc\u3009][\u3008\u03d5\u02dc(E0, \u03c80)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03d5\u02dc\u3009]\n)\n,\nQ\u02dc(partial)\u03d5 (E\u02dc0,\u2126) = \u2206EzdpQ\n(partial)\n\u03d5 (E0,\u2126). (3.4.7)\nThe partial spectrum Q(partial)\u03d5 (E0,\u2126) characterizes the Fourier spectrum of oscillations\nwith initial energy E0. Correspondingly, it has the form of a peak whose absolute maximum\nis near \u03c9(E0) \u2248 \u2126m +\u03c9\u2032\u2032(E0\u2212Em)2\/2 and whose width is \u223c t\u22121zdp, while (see Appendix of\n[48]) the ratio of its absolute value near \u2126m to |Q(partial)\u03d5 (Em,\u2126m)| is\n| Q\u02dc\n(partial)\n\u03d5 (E\u02dc0,\u2126m)\nQ\u02dc\n(partial)\n\u03d5 (0,\u2126m)\n|\u223c\n{\n1 at |E\u02dc0|\n\u223c\n<1,\nexp(\u2212\u03b3E\u02dc0)max(1,\u03b3|E\u02dc0|)\/E\u02dc60 at |E\u02dc0|\u001d1,\n(3.4.8)\ni.e., if \u03b3E\u02dcm \u2261 (Em\u2212Umin)\/T is not too large, then the main contribution to the ZDP (i.e.\nto the integral in (3.4.6) at \u2126 \u2248 \u2126m) is made by energies near the extremal one (|E\u02dc0| \u223c< 1).\nOn the contrary, if (Em\u2212Umin)\/T is large enough, then the main contribution is made by\nthe lowest energies (E0 \u2248 Umin). At the same time, for E0 \u2248 Umin, the conditions under\n23\nwhich Eq. (3.4.5) was obtained are not satisfied, so that the contribution of energies close\nto E0 must be described in a different way. We resolve these two different cases below, in\nsub-sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2\n3.4.1 ZDP at high and moderately small temperatures\nThere is a paradox in the calculation of the spectrum for \u03b3 6= 0, as follows. On the\none hand, Q\u03d5(\u2126 \u2248 \u2126m) is dominated by the contributions from energies E \u2248 Em and,\ntherefore, should not depend on the actual value of E\u02dcm within the relevant wide range\n(see below) but, on the other hand, replacement of the E\u02dcm in (3.4.6) with a minus infinity\nwould be invalid, unlike in the case of \u03b3 = 0, because the result would then diverge 9 .\nThus, we should keep the finite \u2212E\u02dcm for the lower limit in (3.4.6). At the same time, in\nthe calculation of \u3008\u03d5\u02dc(t)\u3009E0,\u03c80 (3.1.10), we may still change the lower energy boundary to\n\u2212\u221e, as in the case when \u03b3 = 0.\nWith account taken of the above remarks and using the explicit solution of the reduced\nFPE (3.4.5), one can obtain for the spectrum [48]:\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) = CscaleS\u02dc(\u2206\u2126\u02dcn,\n\u03b3\n2n1\/4\n,\nE\u02dcmn\n1\/4\n2\n), (3.4.9)\nS\u02dc(x, y, z) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Re [S\u02dcc(x, y, z)]\u2223\u2223\u2223 ,\nS\u02dcc(x, y, z) =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4\nexp\n[\n\u2212ix\u03c4 + y2\n(\n2\/(1\u2212i)\nth[(1\u2212i)\u03c4\/2] \u2212 \u03c4\n)]\n2\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 i) sh[(1\u2212 i)\u03c4 ]\n\u00d7erfc\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u2212z\u221a(1\u2212 i) th[(1\u2212 i)\u03c4 ] + y 1 + sech[(1\u2212 i)\u03c4 ]\u221a\n(1\u2212 i) th[(1\u2212 i)\u03c4 ]\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 ,\n\u03b3E\u02dcm < 5 ln(E\u02dcmn\n1\/4\/2),\nwhere Cscale and \u2206\u2126\u02dcn are defined in (3.3.19), erfc(z) \u2261\n\u221a\n2\/pi\n\u222b\u221e\nz dy exp(\u2212y2) is the\ncomplement of the error function with respect to 1 in the complex plane [49], and the\norigin of the last inequality in (3.4.9) will be clear from Eq. (3.4.10) below.\nIf \u03b3 = 0 and E\u02dcm \u001d 1, then Q\u03d5(\u2126) (3.4.9) reduces to Eq. (3.3.19) and, in particular, the\nshape S\u02dc(x, y, z) reduces at |x| \u223c 1 to S(x) (see also Fig. 12(a)).\nAnalysis of the partial spectrum near \u2126m shows [48] that the structure of S\u02dc(x, y, z) at\nz \u001d 1 is as follows:\n9 Allowing for \u03b3 \u001c 1 in the present case (T \u223c> Em), one could alternatively try to use pertur-\nbation theory, i.e. to expand the term exp(\u03b3E\u02dc0...) in the partial correlation function in a Taylor\nseries over \u03b3 so that its integration down to \u2212\u221e would give a convergent result for R\u03d5(t\u02dc). How-\never, the resultant correction to R\u03d5(t\u02dc) is \u221d t\u02dc\u22123\/2 at small t\u02dc, resulting in the divergence of its\nFourier transform. This divergence indicates that Q\u03d5(\u2126) depends on \u03b3 non-analytically.\n24\nS\u02dc(x, y, z) = S\u02dczdp(x, y) +\n\u000f\n8\n\u221a\npi\nexp(4yz)\nz5\n, (3.4.10)\n\u000f =\n{\n\u223c1 at yz\u223c<1,\n1 at yz\u001d1,\nS\u02dczdp(x, y) \u223c 1, z \u001d 1, |x| \u223c< 1, y \u223c< 1.\nAs can be seen from (3.4.10), at 4yz \u2261 Em\/T < 5 ln(z) the second term on the right-\nhand side of (3.4.10) (which is determined by the low energies) is exponentially small in\ncomparison with the first term (which is determined by energies near Em). This confirms\nthe independence of Q\u03d5(\u2126) on E\u02dcm in the range defined in (3.4.9). The independence of\nS\u02dc(x, y, z) on z in the corresponding range is also confirmed by numerical calculations (Fig.\n12(b)).\nProperly speaking, just the function S\u02dczdp(x, y) describes the shape of the ZDP itself. Both\nthe qualitative analysis and numerical calculations (see Fig. 12(a)) show that, at y \u001c 1,\nS\u02dczdp(x, y) has the shape of a peak reducing to S(x) as y \u2192 0; as y grows to \u223c 1, the\nright wing of the peak lifts (creating a minimum after which the function grow sharply\nas x increases); at some y \u223c 1, the peak transforms into a step followed by rapid growth\nas x increases. Finally, at y \u001d 1, S\u02dczdp(x, y) is a monotonically (and sharply) increasing\nfunction of x but S\u02dc on the whole becomes exponentially large while the concept of the\nZDP loses its physical meaning.\n3.4.2 ZDPs at low temperatures\nStrictly speaking, the contribution from the lowest energies (E \u2248 Umin, i.e. E\u02dc \u2248 \u2212E\u02dcm)\nhas not been correctly taken into account in the previous section. But, given that this\ncontribution is negligible at T\n\u223c\n> Em\u2212Umin, Eq. (3.4.9) nonetheless describes the spectrum\ncorrectly at such temperatures. On the contrary, however, for T \u001c Em \u2212 Umin, which is\nthe most relevant range of temperatures for \u03b3 \u223c 1, the contribution of low energies may\nbecome dominant and it should be evaluated differently from Sec. 3.4.1.\nLet us first divide the whole integration range in (3.4.6) into three sub-ranges:\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) =\nUmin+\u03b1T\u222b\nUmin\ndE0...+\nEm\u2212\u03b2(Em\u2212Umin)\u222b\nUmin+\u03b1T\ndE0...+\n\u221e\u222b\nEm\u2212\u03b2(Em\u2212Umin)\ndE0... (3.4.11)\n\u2261 Q(low)\u03d5 (\u2126) +Q(int)\u03d5 (\u2126) +Q(zdp)\u03d5 (\u2126),\nE\u02dc\u22121m \u001c \u03b2 < 1, 1\u001c \u03b1 < (Em \u2212 \u03b2(Em \u2212 Umin))\/T, T\/(Em \u2212 Umin)\u001c 1.\nThe contribution of the intermediate range, Q(int)\u03d5 (\u2126), can easily be shown [48] to be\nnegligible in comparison with the either first or third term in (3.4.11).\nThe third term, Q(zdp)\u03d5 (\u2126), is described similarly to the case for T\n\u223c\n> Em, the only difference\nbeing that E\u02dcm in Eq. (3.4.9) should be exchanged for \u03b2E\u02dcm.\n25\nThe first term, Q(low)\u03d5 (\u2126), is determined by weakly nonlinear oscillations in the minimum\nof the potential and has a narrow peak near \u21260 \u2261 \u03c9(E = Umin) while \u2126m is located on\nits far wing. It may easily be shown 10 that the far wings of Q(low)\u03d5 (\u2126) coincide with the\nspectrum calculated in the harmonic approximation, Q(harmonic)\u03d5 (\u2126,\u21260); e.g. for \u03d5 = q, the\nrelevant spectrum is\nQ(harmonic)\u03d5 (\u2126,\u21260) =\n\u0393T (\u21262 + \u212620)\n2pi\u212620(\u2126\n2 \u2212 \u212620)\n. (3.4.12)\nThus, ultimately, we obtain for the spectrum in the vicinity of \u2126m:\nQ\u03d5(\u2126 \u2248 \u2126m) = CscaleS\u02dc(\u2206\u2126\u02dcn, \u03b3\n2n1\/4\n,\n\u03b2E\u02dcmn\n1\/4\n2\n) +Q(harmonic)\u03d5 (\u2126,\u21260), (3.4.13)\n\u03b2 \u001d E\u02dc\u22121m , 1\u2212 \u03b2 \u001d T\/(Em \u2212 Umin), |\u2126\u2212 n\u2126m| \u001c \u2126m, |\u21260 \u2212 n\u2126m|,\nn = 1, 2, 3...\nThe first (ZDP) term in (3.4.13) depends on T exponentially strongly, whereas the sec-\nond term (the low-energy tail) depends on T relatively weakly (in a power-like way: cf.\n(3.4.12)). Thus, there is some critical temperature T (n)c below which the ZDP is not man-\nifested while, above T (n)c , the ZDP dominates. Furthermore, in order to be definite, we\nshall consider the spectrum of fluctuations of the coordinate; but the main results will be\nvalid for arbitrary \u03d5.\nIn order to find T (n)c to logarithmic accuracy, one should equate the orders of magnitude\nof Cscale (3.3.19) and Q\n(harmonic)\nq (n\u2126m,\u21260) (3.4.12), so that\nT (n)c \u2248\nEm\n5 ln(E\u02dcm + 2 ln(|qn\/q1|))\n, T (n)c \u001c Em. (3.4.14)\nIt is seen from (3.4.14) that the number of ZDPs is finite because, at large enough n, qn\ndecreases exponentially as n grows. Thus T (n)c reaches infinity at the critical value n = nc\nwhich can be determined approximately from the equation:\n| qn\nq1\n|\u223c ( \u0393\n\u2126m\n)5\/8. (3.4.15)\nIt is seen also from (3.4.14) that the minimal critical temperature Tc \u2248 Em\/(5 ln(E\u02dcm)\ncorresponds to n = 1. In the asymptotic limit \u0393\u2192 0,\nTc =\nEm\n5\n4\nln(\u2126m\n\u0393\n)\n. (3.4.16)\n10 To the lowest order in \u2206\u21260\/|\u2126 \u2212 \u21260|, where \u2206\u21260 is the width of the peak Q(low)\u03d5 (\u2126), the\nspectrum on the wings is entirely determined by the dR\u03d5(t = 0)\/dt which, in turn, coincides\nwith the expression calculated in the harmonic approximation.\n26\nThe coefficient \u03b3(T = Tc) \u2261 \u03b3c is\n\u03b3c =\n[\n5 ln(E\u02dcm)\nE\u02dcm\n]\nTc\n. (3.4.17)\nIn the asymptotic limit \u0393\u2192 0, \u03b3c goes to zero too. Hence, at small enough \u0393, the shape of\nthe ZDP is close to the universal shape (3.3.19) from the very manifestation of the ZDP,\nat T \u2248 Tc.\nAt the same time, if \u0393 is not small enough, so that the inequality (3.4.4) is not too\nstrong, then the shape of the ZDP at T \u2248 Tc is step-like and only gradually evolves to\nthe universal peak shape as T grows. Just this type of the evolution was observed in [11]\n(see Fig. 14) where E\u02dcm \u2248 3 at T \u2248 Tc.\nIn order to demonstrate the two different types of ZDP evolution with temperature, we\ncalculate Qq(\u2126) from Eqs. (3.4.13), (3.4.12) for the same system as in [11] (the tilted\nDuffing oscillator 11 : see also sub-section 2.3 above), at two different values of \u0393. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 13.\n3.5 General theory\nThe explicit description of ZDPs given in the previous sub-sections is important for an\nunderstanding of the relevant physical mechanisms and of the characteristic features of\nZDPs. At the same time, quantitative agreement with real spectra is restricted to the very\nlow friction and very narrow frequency ranges.\nIn order to provide an accurate theoretical description of spectra in a broad frequency\nrange and in the whole range of small (rather than just ultra-small) friction, a special\nmethod [11] was developed and later generalized for multi-well potentials [47]. Note that\nthe method is not restricted to ZD systems: it facilitates the calculation of fluctuation spec-\ntra for any underdamped system. We illustrate below the major features of this method\nusing as an example the fluctuation spectrum of a generalized coordinate (magnetic flux)\nin a multi-well SQUID potential (Fig. 3(b)).\nLet us present the correlation function Rq(t) (3.1.5) in the following form:\nRq(t) =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndp\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndq (q \u2212 \u3008q\u3009) \u02dc\u02dcW (p, q, t), (3.5.1)\n11 In fact, the TDO is far from being the best model for illustrating the ZDP evolution with\ntemperature: it typically requires a very small value of \u0393. Historically, however, the TDO was\nthe first system in which ZDPs and their evolution were observed, which is why we consider it\nhere. In sub-section 3.6, describing analogue experiments, we shall illustrate ZDP evolution for\nthe SQUID model as well.\n27\n\u02dc\u02dcW (p, q, t) =\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndp0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndq0 (q0 \u2212 \u3008q\u3009)W (p, q, t|p0, q0)Wst(p0, q0).\nThe function \u02dc\u02dcW satisfies the same FPE as W (see (3.1.2)) but with a different initial\ncondition:\n\u02dc\u02dcW (p, q, 0) = (q \u2212 \u3008q\u3009)Wst(p, q). (3.5.2)\nFor further analysis, it is convenient to rewrite the FPE (3.1.2) in the energy-angle rep-\nresentation 12 and to make a half-Fourier-transform with respect to time. For the sake of\ngenerality, we assume a multi-well potential (a single-well potential may be considered as\na particular case), so that the energy-angle representation must be differently defined in\ndifferent regions of the phase space, divided by separatrices corresponding to the barrier\nenergy levels (cf. Fig. 3(b)).\nTagging each such region with an index j, we can write the equation for the half-Fourier\ntransform WF in the j-th phase space region as\n\u2212i\u2126WF + \u03c9\u2202WF\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u0393L\u02c6WF + (q \u2212 \u3008q\u3009)Wst(q, p), (3.5.3)\nL\u02c6 \u2261 L\u02c6(j)(E,\u03c8) =[\np\n\u2202\n\u2202E\n\u2212 \u03c9qE \u2202\n\u2202\u03c8\n] [\np\n(\n1 + T\n\u2202\n\u2202E\n)\n\u2212 T\u03c9qE \u2202\n\u2202\u03c8\n]\n,\n\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9(j)(E), q \u2261 q(j)(E,\u03c8), p \u2261 p(j)(E,\u03c8),\nWF \u2261 W (j)F (E,\u03c8,\u2126) =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ndt exp(i\u2126t) \u02dc\u02dcW (p, q, t).\nAllowing for the periodicity of WF in \u03c8, we may expand it in a Fourier series,\nW\n(j)\nF (E,\u03c8; \u2126) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\nW (j)n (E,\u2126) exp(in\u03c8). (3.5.4)\nSubstituting (3.5.4) into (3.5.3), we obtain\n\u2212(\u2126\u2212 n\u03c9(j))W (j)n = \u0393\n\u2211\nm\nL\u02c6(j)nmW\n(j)\nm + (q\n(j)\nn \u2212 \u3008q\u3009\u03b4n0)Wst, (3.5.5)\nL\u02c6(j)nm =\n1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c8 exp(\u2212in\u03c8)L\u02c6(j) exp(im\u03c8),\n12 Note that the result differs slightly from the FPE (3.3.8) for W\u02dc (E,\u03c8, t) since these equations\nrelate to differently normalized functions: W\u02dc\/W = \u2202(p, q)\/\u2202(E,\u03c8) = \u03c9\u22121(E) [1].\n28\nq(j)n =\n1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c8 exp(\u2212in\u03c8)q(j)(E,\u03c8),\nwhere \u03b4n0 is a Kronecker delta (\u03b4n0 = 1 for n = 0, whereas \u03b4n0 = 0 for n 6= 0). Our aim is\nto find the W (j)n , since the fluctuation spectrum can be written in terms of them as\nQq(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nj\n2 Re\n[ E(j)max\u222b\nE\n(j)\nmin\ndE\n\u03c9(j)(E)\n\u00d7\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\n(q(j)n (E))\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4n0\u3008q\u3009\n)\nW (j)n (E,\u2126)\n]\n, (3.5.6)\nwhere E\n(j)\nmin and E\n(j)\nmax are respectively the minimum and maximum energies of the j-th\nregion and the star \u2217 denotes the operation of complex conjugation.\nAssuming that the friction is small and that we are interested in peaks of the spectrum\nrather than in low fluctuational plateaus, we retain in Eq. (3.5.5) only diagonal terms\nsince the influence of different resonances on each other is negligible 13 [11]. Thus, we\nobtain for each W (j)n a closed equation:\n\u2212i(\u2126\u2212 n\u03c9)W (j)n = \u0393\n(\n1 + p2\nd\ndE\n)(\n1 + T\nd\ndE\n)\nW (j)n\n\u2212\u0393Tn2\u03c92q2EW (j)n + (qn \u2212 \u03b4n0\u3008q\u3009)Wst , (3.5.7)\nwhere the bar, as before, implies averaging over the angle ( 1\n2pi\n\u222b 2pi\n0 d\u03c8 . . .).\nIn order to solve Eq. (3.5.7), we also need to know the boundary conditions at E\n(j)\nmin and\nE(j)max for each region. We now show that if n 6= 0 14 , then W (j)n vanishes at the boundaries:\nW (j)n (E\n(j)\nmin,\u2126) = W\n(j)\nn (E\n(j)\nmax,\u2126) = 0. (3.5.8)\nThe condition at E(j)max \u2261 \u221e immediately follows from the vanishing of the probability\ndensity as E \u2192\u221e. The derivation for other boundaries is less trivial.\nConsider first those E\n(j)\nmin which correspond to local minima of the potential U\n(j)\nmin. Near\n13 This procedure is equivalent to neglecting the nonresonant terms in the original FPE in the\nenergy-angle representation (3.3.8), in accordance with the averaging method: cf. (3.3.11).\n14 The boundary conditions for the case n = 0 require separate analysis [50,51] but, given that\nZDPs are located at distinctly non-zero frequencies, the case n = 0 is not relevant in the present\ncontext.\n29\nthese local minima, the self-oscillations are approximately harmonic, so that\np2 \u2248 E \u2212 U (j)min, q2E \u2248\n1\n4\u03c920(E \u2212 U (j)min)\n, q1 \u2248\n\u221a\n2\u03c90\u221a\nE \u2212 U (j)min\n. (3.5.9)\nThe solutions of (3.5.7), (3.5.9) can be seen to be either\u221d (E\u2212U (j)min)1\/2 or\u221d (E\u2212U (j)min)\u22121\/2.\nAllowing for the finiteness of the probability density (and therefore also of W (j)n ), one\nchooses the convergent solution and thus arrives at the condition W (j)n (E\n(j)\nmin,\u2126) = 0.\nSimilarly, for boundaries corresponding to the levels of potential barriers, E\n(j)\nb ,\nq2E \u221d\n1\n(| E \u2212 E(j)b |)2\n, (3.5.10)\nso that the solution of (3.5.7), (3.5.10) may be either convergent (\u221d| E \u2212 E(j)b |) or\ndivergent (\u221d (| E \u2212 E(j)b |)\u22121). Choosing the convergent solution, one arrives at the\ncondition W (j)n (E\n(j)\nb ,\u2126) = 0.\nEq. (3.5.7), together with the boundary conditions (3.5.8) is easily solved numerically\nby a standard method (the coefficients in the equation are easily calculated from their\ndefinition: see [11,46]). Results for several examples will be presented in the next sub-\nsection (see Figs. 14-17).\n3.6 Analogue electronic experiments\nA valuable method for studying fluctuational phenomena in dynamical systems is to model\nthe dynamics and the noise by means of analogue electrical circuits, electronic chips and\nnoise generators (for reviews see [52\u201354]). ZDPs were observed in several such exper-\niments and studied in various aspects [11,45\u201347,55\u201357]. We present below some typical\nexperimental results together with their comparison with calculations based on the theory\ndescribed in the previous sub-sections.\nThe first experimental results [55] were obtained, in fact, as a wholly unexpected by-\nproduct of the search for the zero-frequency peak in the TDO model [50]. Later [11],\nthey were developed and compared with the theory. Fig. 14 presents the evolution with\nincreasing T of the spectrum in the TDO model, with U(q) as given in (2.3.1) and drawn in\nFig. 7. First of all, we see that the theoretical calculations nicely match the experimental\nresults. Secondly, it is seen that, at low temperatures (curve (a)), the spectrum is centred\nclose to the bottom eigenfrequency \u21260 = 2 (cf. Fig.7) while, at the high temperature\n(curve (c)), the spectrum is centred close to the minimal eigenfrequency \u2126m \u2248 1.76. For\nthe given intermediate temperature (curve (b)), the spectrum has the shape of a wide\nnearly rectangular peak with a flat top, from \u2248 \u2126m to \u2248 \u21260. Thus, as the temperature\nincreases from (b) to (c), the spectral peak becomes significantly narrower, quite unlike\nthe conventional case with a monotonic \u03c9(E) when the increase of noise necessarily results\n30\nin a broadening of the spectrum. The narrowing is related to the onset of the ZDP, which\nis narrow and becomes dominant at high enough temperature. At the same time, the\nspectrum retains a single-peaked structure at all temperatures just because the friction\nis not small enough for two peaks to be resolved: the parameter \u03b3 at T = Tc (i.e. at the\nonset of the ZDP) is \u223c 1 and the ZDP is step-shaped while merging, at the same time,\nwith the peak determined by the low energy range. In the case of the TDO, the friction\nparameter should be at least a few times smaller in order for the ZDP to be resolved\nfrom the low-energy peak. In [45], an approximately 11 times smaller value of the friction\nparameter was achieved 15 (\u0393 \u2248 1.7\u00d7 10\u22123): see Fig. 15. Agreement with the theoretical\ncalculations using the algorithm described in sub-section 3.5 is excellent [45].\nIn [46], the spectra were studied experimentally for two different models, the TDO and\nSQUID, and compared with the explicit expressions [48] described in sub-section 3.4\nabove with the aim of demonstrating the universality of the ZDP shape and its evolution\nwith temperature. The agreement obtained was reasonably satisfactory: see Figs. 16,17.\nThe observed deviations of about 30% in Fig. 16(a,b) are partly due to the exponential\nsensitivity to parameters, and partly because the small parameter in the theory (x\u22121m )\nis in reality not very small in these cases. The absence of the plateau in the theoretical\ncurves in the right-hand insets in Fig. 17(a,b) is because the theoretical curves account\nonly for the ZDP contribution while the low-energy contribution is not included 16 (cf.\nEq. (3.4.13), which includes both contributions).\nFigs. 16,17 provide a clear experimental verification of the universality of the ZDP evo-\nlution, showing both types of ZDP onset: step-wise (Figs. 16(a,b)) and peak-wise (Figs.\n17(a,b)). In addition, they demonstrate that the SQUID model provides a much more pro-\nnounced manifestation of ZDPs than the TDO, because of the better resolution between\nthe frequency and energy ranges responsible for the ZDP and for the low-energy peak.\nThis has allowed observation of a pronounced manifestation of zero-dispesion stochastic\nresonance (ZDSR) [47,56,57] in the SQUID model but not in the TDO (cf. [58], where\nnoise-induced growth of the signal\/noise ratio was not achieved because it would have re-\nquired unrealistically small values of \u0393). Fig. 18 presents the results from [47], where the\nspectra of the SQUID model were studied most thoroughly. The spectral evolution with\ntemperature demonstrates very nicely the sequential \u201cfiring\u201d of ZDPs corresponding to\nthe different extrema of \u03c9(E) (see Fig. 4). Fig. 18 also demonstrates excellent agreement\nbetween the measured spectra and spectra calculated by the algorithm described above\nin sub-section 3.5, over the whole relevant range of frequencies 17 .\n15 In order to provide the required extremely small value of \u0393, the corresponding feedback resistor\non the first integrator was necessarily made rather larger (\u223c 100M\u2126) than would normally [52\u2013\n54] be used in circuit-modelling experiments, thereby exacerbating the effect of leakage currents,\nstray capacitance and other non-idealities of the components.\n16 The low-energy contribution is not included since it is not universal. The major aim of [46]\nwas to demonstrate the universality of the evolution of the ZDP shape as T varies.\n17 The theoretical calculations did not include the zero-frequency peak since it was not relevant\nto ZDSR and would have required special consideration [50,51].\n31\n3.7 Unsolved problems\nAlthough most of the fundamental issues related to ZDPs seem already to have been\nsolved, there still remain some interesting open questions.\nOne of the hitherto unstudied problems relates to the hierarchy of ZDPs related to the\norder of an extremum \u03c9(E). The explicit expressions for the asymptotic ZDP shape and\nits evolution with temperature, derived above in sub-sections 3.3 and 3.4 (Eqs. (3.3.19)\nand (3.4.9) respectively), assume that d2\u03c9(Em)\/dE\n2\nm 6= 0, which is the most frequently\noccurring case in real systems. At the same time, it is possible in principle that the order\nof the lowest nonzero derivative at the extremum is higher than 2 (as for an inflection\npoint, for instance). In this case, the shape of the ZDP will differ from (3.3.19), while still\nbeing universal, i.e. described by a function that is independent of any parameter. Thus\nthe hierarchy of universal shapes of the ZDP depends on the order of the extremum of\nthe functions \u03c9(E). The quantitative analysis of this hierarchy, based on the reduction\nof the full Fokker-Planck equation to the asymptotic dimensionless one, and its further\nsolution has yet to be tackled. Following [46], we now present some qualitative estimates.\nWe shall suppose in this sub-section that the dependence \u03c9(E) is power-law-like near the\nextremum:\n\u03c9(E) = \u2126m +\n1\n(1 + k)!\n\u03c9(1+k)(E \u2212 Em)1+k, k = 1, 2, 3, ... (3.7.1)\nThe characteristic time t\n(k)\nzdp for the decay of the angle correlation is determined by the\nfluctuations of energy, giving rise in turn to fluctuations of the angle derivative with respect\nto time d\u03c8\/dt \u2248 \u03c9(E) and, correspondingly, to a loss of the angle correlation. As in sub-\nsection 3.3, in order to estimate t\n(k)\nzdp, we need to take into account the diffusion-like growth\nwith time of the energy distribution (for an initially definite value of energy) [38]: \u2206E(t) \u223c\u221a\n\u0393Tp2t. Correspondingly, within the relevant range of energies, the characteristic width\nof the fluctuational distribution of angles is of the order of \u2206\u03c8(t) \u223c |\u03c9(Em \u00b1 \u2206E(t)) \u2212\n\u03c9(Em)|t. Allowing for \u2206\u03c8(t(k)zdp) \u223c pi, we arrive at\nt\n(k)\nzdp \u223c\n1\n|\u03c9(1+k)\/(1 + k)!| 23+k (\u0393Tp2) 1+k3+k\n\u221d 1\n\u0393\n1+k\n3+k\n.

The ZDP should typically persist but its shape may be expected\nto change. But the linearity of the friction is not crucial. It is important only that the\nnet loss of energy within one period of oscillation should be much smaller than Em, while\ndetails of the dependence of friction on velocity and coordinate are not very important.\nSimilarly, the case of multiplicative noise in ZD systems has not yet been studied.\nWe anticipate that the major emphasis of further investigations related to ZDPs will be\non applications to real systems, and on using ZDPs as a non-destructive method for the\ndetermination of parameters. Given the strong sensitivity of the ZDP magnitude to Em\nand T (\u221d exp(\u2212Em\/T )), as well as their narrowness (\u221d\n\u221a\n\u0393) and height (\u221d \u0393\u22121\/4), ZDPs\nare likely to provide a convenient tool for the determination of T and\/or other parameters\naffecting Em or \u2126m.\n3.8 Conclusions\nTo summarize, if a ZD system is subject to noise and weak friction, then the spectrum of\nits fluctuations may possess a high narrow peak (ZDP) near the extremal eigenfrequency\n\u2126m = \u03c9(Em), as well as peaks at its harmonics. The origin of the ZDPs lies in a long\ncorrelation in the angle dynamics during the motion within the narrow band of energies\nnear Em: diffusion of energy in this band nearly does not affect the angle (\u03c8 \u2248 \u222b dt \u03c9(E)\nwhile d\u03c9(Em)\/dEm = 0).\nIn the asymptotic limit of small friction \u0393, the peaks become infinitely high and infinites-\n18 Note that conventionally understood coloured noise, i.e. the noise with a correlation time\ncomparable with a characteristic period of eigenoscillation (\u2126\u22121m , in our case), may still be\nconsidered as a white noise in the context of the ZDP. In order for the colour to affect the ZDP\nshape, it is necessary that tN\n\u223c\n> tzdp where tzdp is given by Eq. (3.3.4) in which the product \u0393T\nmeans, in general, the noise intensity.\n33\nimally narrow:\nQzdp \u221d 1\n\u03931\/4\n, (3.8.1)\n\u2206\u2126zdp \u221d \u03931\/2, (3.8.2)\nwhile the scaled shape reduces to the universal form S(x) (3.3.19).\nThe influence of temperature on ZDPs is mainly due to the activation-like dependence of\nthe statistical weight of the relevant energies about Em:\nQzdp \u221d e\u2212EmT , (3.8.3)\nThus, at too small temperatures, ZDPs are not manifested at all on the background of\nthe smooth fluctuational plateau (\u221d \u0393T ) which is formed by low-energy oscillations with\nthe frequency \u21260, and the onset of the fundamental (at \u2126 \u2248 \u2126m) ZDP occurs at\nT = Tc \u2248 Em5\n4\nln( |\u21260\u2212\u2126m|\n\u0393\n)\n, (3.8.4)\nln(\n|\u21260 \u2212 \u2126m|\n\u0393\n\u001d 1 .\nAs the temperature grows, the ZDP becomes dominant over the low-energy tail in the\nrelevant range of \u2126 \u2248 \u2126m.\nZDPs are also manifested at a finite number of higher harmonics, such that |qn\/q1| \u001d\n(\u0393\/\u2126m)\n5\/8. As the temperature grows from Tc to T\n\u223c\n> Em, the shape of the ZDP evolves\ntowards the universal form S(x). This evolution is governed by only one parameter \u03b3\n(3.4.2), which is a monotonically decreasing function of temperature: \u03b3 \u223c [(\u0393\/|\u2126m \u2212\n\u21260|)(Em\/T )3]1\/4 \u221d T\u22123\/4. If \u03b3 \u001c 1, then the shape is close to the universal one while, if \u03b3\nincreases to \u223c 1, the shape becomes step-like; with further growth of \u03b3, the ZDP concept\nloses physical sense because the low-energy contribution becomes dominant.\nIn the asymptotic limit \u0393 \u2192 0, \u03b3c \u2261 \u03b3(Tc) \u2192 0 so that the ZDP possesses the universal\nshape S from its very onset.\nThe explicit expressions (3.3.19), (3.4.9) and (3.4.13) provide a qualitative understanding\nof the ZDPs\u2019 formation as well as a quantitative description in the relevant (narrow) range\nof frequencies near \u2126m, provided the friction parameter is very small. For an accurate\ndescription of spectra over a broad range of frequencies, and for the full range of small\nfrictions (\u0393\/\u2126m \u001c 1), one may use a simple numerical method based on an averaging\ntechnique (see sub-section 3.5).\nThe theory provides a satisfactory description of the results of experiments on analogue\nelectronic circuits.\n34\nThe phenomenon of ZDPs may be used for the non-destructive determination of pa-\nrameters as well as providing the underlying physical basis for the phenomenon of the\nzero-dispersion stochastic resonance (see sub-section 5.1. below).\n35\n4 Periodically-driven zero-dispersion systems\nPeriodically driven dynamical systems are of long-standing interest both to mathemati-\ncians and to other scientists, forming a subject that is fundamental and also of importance\nin numerous applications.\nThe concept of nonlinear resonance in periodically-driven Hamiltonian systems was intro-\nduced by Chirikov while studying magnetic traps [59]. It has become of seminal importance\nin studies of Hamiltonian systems, especially in the context of chaos [5,35,60]. One of its\nmost important features is that the behaviour of a periodically driven Hamiltonian system\nis to a large extent universal and described approximately by the so-called standard map\n[5,35,60].\nAt the same time, conventional nonlinear resonance (NR) as above, and the standard\nmap, are valid only if they relate to the energy range where d\u03c9(E)\/dE 6= 0. The dynamics\nbecome drastically different if the resonance occurs close to an extremal energy Em where\nd\u03c9(E)\/dE = 0. Probably the first study of such a situation was that in [26], where\nthe problem of rf acceleration in particle accelerators was studied numerically and the\noccurrence of a characteristic separatrix reconnection in the phase space with variation\nof the parameters of the corresponding map was observed. Separatrix reconnection was\nalso found in relation to some other physical problems, e.g. motion of magnetic field lines\n[61], wave-particle interactions [62] and laser-plasma coupling [63]. The identification of\nsuch maps as a general class, and some analytic studies of their separatrix reconnection,\nwere first reported in [8]. Later, two alternative titles were established for such maps:\nnonmonotonic twist maps [9] and area preserving nontwist maps [10]. They were used\nin a number of papers in the context of a variety of physical problems, e.g. transport\nand mixing in fluids [64,65] and dynamics of rays in optical waveguides [66]. A detailed\nclassification 19 of this class of maps was presented in [9,10] together with some analytic\nand numerical studies of their properties, especially in the context of the breakage of\nKAM trajectories and onset of global chaos.\nIndependently of the studies of maps, the concept of zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\n(ZDNR) was introduced in [67] via an averaging method [41]. The evolution of the phase\nspace (via separatrix reconnection) as the frequency of the driving force varied was then\nstudied analytically and numerically [68]. The authors of [67,68] were unaware of the\nstudies of the maps described above, so that there was a significant overlap between the\nresults. At the same time, even in these initial papers on ZDNR, features were found that\nwere not present in the earlier papers on maps. In particular, it was shown [67] that ZDNR\noccured, not only within the spectrum of eigenfrequencies, but also within a restricted\nband of frequencies beyond the extremal eigenfrequency 20 .\nThe subsequent studies of ZDNR evolved mainly in four directions that were distinctly\ndifferent from those on area preserving nontwist maps. One of these was a generalization\n19 The classification relates to different types of extremum in \u03c9(E). The analogous classification\nin relation to ZDPs was done earlier in [46] (cf. also Sec. 3.7 above).\n20 Nearly simultaneously, a similar feature was found [66] for maps.\n36\nof the concept of ZDNR to the weakly dissipative case [69]. This has provided a powerful\ntool for the analysis of both non-chaotic and chaotic dynamics in such systems, including\nin particular a thorough local and global bifurcation analysis [70] and the generalization\nof the Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion for the onset of chaos to the dissipative case\n[71\u201373] 21 . The second direction is the study of the chaos associated with ZDNR in non-\ndissipative systems: this includes both the derivation of the corresponding separatrix map\n[75,71] (which is distinctly different from the conventional separatrix map [60]) and the\ndramatic facilitation of the onset of global chaos in systems with more than one separa-\ntrix [21,76]. The third direction involves the inclusion of fluctuations [77,71,78]. Finally,\napplications to various particular models which had not been studied previously in this\ncontext were considered, such as the TDO [67\u201375], relativistic oscillators [30,31], SQUIDs\n[79] and the 2D electron gas in a one-dimensional magnetic superlattice [20,21,76].\nThe material that follows in this section is based mainly on the studies of ZDNR reported\nin [67\u201377,79,30,31,20,21].\n4.1 Slow-oscillating dynamics and zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\nConsider the general case of a one-dimensional periodically driven oscillator:\np\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202q\n\u2212 \u0393fp(q, p),\nq\u02d9 =\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\n\u2212 \u0393fq(q, p),\nH = H0(p, q) + hV (p, q, t), V (p, q, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\nVl(p, q)cos(l\u03c9f t+ \u03b1l), (4.1.1)\nwhere, if \u0393 = 0, the system is Hamiltonian whereas, if \u0393 > 0, then the terms proportional\nto fq and fp provide the dissipation condition, i.e. a volume contraction of the phase space\nwith time on average.\nIt is convenient to transform to the canonically conjugate variables action I and angle \u03c8\n[1,35,60] (see also eqs.(A.2)-(A.4) in Appendix):\nI \u2261 I(E) =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 E\u222b\nEmin\ndE\u02dc\n\u03c9(E\u02dc)\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\nE=H0(p,q)\n, \u03c8 =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\u03c9(E) q\u222b\nqmin(E)\ndq\u02dc\np(q\u02dc, E)\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\nE=H0(p,q)\n, (4.1.2)\nwhere\nE = H0(p, q) (4.1.3)\n21 The latter is still under active study [74].\n37\nis the energy in conservative motion (\u0393 = 0, h = 0),\n\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9(E) = dH0\/dI (4.1.4)\nis the frequency of conservative motion at a given energy E; Emin is the minimal (over\nall q, p) energy E \u2261 H0(p, q) and qmin \u2261 qmin(E) is the minimal (for given E) coordinate\nq \u2261 q(E, p), and q(E, p) and p(E, q) are determined from (4.1.3).\nBy definition, the unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian does not depend on angle, and\nthe periodic perturbation can be expanded into a Fourier series over \u03c8,\nH \u2261 H\u02dc0(I) + hV\u02dc (I, \u03c8, t), (4.1.5)\nV\u02dc (I, \u03c8, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nV\n(n)\nl (I)cos(n\u03c8 + \u03b2n)cos(l\u03c9f t+ \u03b1l).\nNote that V\n(n)\nl is twice larger than a conventionally defined Fourier harmonic (cf. (A.5)\nin Appendix); this non-conventional definition was used in [70], and we retain it here to\navoid confusion.\nThe dynamics (4.1.1) are expressed in I\u2212\u03c8 variables in the following way (cf. Appendix):\nI\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2212 \u0393\n\u03c9\n(\n\u2202H0\n\u2202p\nfp +\n\u2202H0\n\u2202q\nfq),\n(4.1.6)\n\u03c8\u02d9 =\n\u2202H\n\u2202I\n+ \u0393\u03c9(\u2212pEfq + qEfp).\nIt is assumed in what follows that both the dissipation and the periodic perturbation are\nsmall. If this were not the case, nonlinear resonance would not occur: the undriven motion\nwould be non-oscillatory for strong damping; and it could change its period or become\nchaotic if the periodic perturbation was large.\nLet us consider the range of actions (or energies, equivalently) where the resonance con-\ndition holds approximately for some integers n and l,\nn\u03c9(I) \u2248 l\u03c9f . (4.1.7)\nIntroducing the slow angle\n\u03c8\u02dc = n\u03c8 \u2212 l\u03c9f t+ \u03b2n \u2212 \u03b1l, (4.1.8)\nusing a standard averaging method [41] and some formal transformations, one can obtain\na closed set of dynamical equations for I, \u03c8\u02dc (cf. the non-dissipative case [5,35,59,60,67,68]\nand some partial dissipative cases [69\u201373]),\n38\nI\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n\u2212 \u0393fI ,\n(4.1.9)\n\u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 =\n\u2202H\n\u2202I\n\u2212 \u0393f\u03c8\u02dc,\nH \u2261 H(I, \u03c8\u02dc) =\nI\u222b\n0\ndI\u02dc (n\u03c9(I\u02dc)\u2212 l\u03c9f ) + h\n2\nnV\n(n)\nl (I)cos(\u03c8\u02dc),\nfI \u2261 fI(I) = 1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c8\n(\nfp\n\u2202q\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2212 fq \u2202p\n\u2202\u03c8\n)\n,\nf\u03c8\u02dc \u2261 f\u03c8\u02dc(I) =\n1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c8 n\n(\n\u2212fp \u2202q\n\u2202I\n+ fq\n\u2202p\n\u2202I\n)\n.\nThe system (4.1.9) is necessarily non-chaotic and describes slow dynamics in the vicinity\nof nonlinear resonance. Note also that if the original system (4.1.1) is dissipative (\u0393 > 0),\nthen the averaged system (4.1.9) obviously displays dissipative behaviour too.\nIn that case, if \u0393 = 0 and d\u03c9\/dI is distinctly non-zero in the relevant range of ac-\ntions\/energies near the resonant one (see the criterion below or, e.g., in [35]), the inte-\ngrand in the auxiliary Hamiltonian H (4.1.9) may be linearized so that the slow dynamics\nreduce to pendulum motion in the space of the slow variables I\u02dc \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc:\nH \u2248 1\n2\nd\u03c9(Ir)\ndIr\nI\u02dc2 +\nh\n2\nnV\n(n)\nl (Ir)cos(\u03c8\u02dc), (4.1.10)\nI\u02dc \u2261 I \u2212 Ir, n\u03c9(Ir) \u2248 l\u03c9f ,\nd\u03c9(Ir)\/dIr 6= 0,\nwhich describes the slow dynamics of conventional nonlinear resonance (NR) [5,35,59,60].\nThere are regions of the phase space where the slow angle is trapped (Fig. 19(a)), which\nmeans that the angle of the oscillator approximately follows the angle of the external\nperiodic perturbation, slowly and weakly oscillating around it, while the action\/energy\nslowly and weakly oscillates around the resonant action\/energy. The regions of trapped\n\u03c8\u02dc are separated from regions of running \u03c8\u02dc by the separatrix of the heteroclinic topology.\nThe maximal variation of the slow angle within the trapped region is equal to 2pi while\nthe variation of action\/energy is \u221d \u221ah.\nOn the other hand, if the system is of the ZD type and the driving frequency is close to\nthe extremal eigenfrequency \u03c9m \u2261 \u03c9(I = Im), then the integrand in H (4.1.9) cannot\nbe linearized and the slow dynamics are far different from those in the pendulum-like\nauxiliary system (4.1.10). The asymptotic form of the auxiliary Hamiltonian H is then as\nfollows [68] (assuming the asymptotic limits \u03c9f \u2192 \u03c9m, I \u2192 Im and h\u2192 0):\n39\nH \u2248 (\u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9f )(I \u2212 Im) + 1\n6\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032m(I \u2212 Im)3 +\nh\n2\nnV\n(n)\nl (Im)cos(\u03c8\u02dc), (4.1.11)\nd\u03c9(Im)\/dIm = 0, \u03c9\n\u2032\u2032\nm \u2261 d2\u03c9(Im)\/dI2m.\nThe separatrix separating the regions of the trapped and running angle possesses the\nhomoclinic topology (Fig. 19(b)). The maximal variation of the slow angle within the\ntrapped region is typically\u001c 2pi while the variation of action is typically\u221d h1\/3, and hence\nis larger than in the conventional case (4.1.10). In order to distinguish this behaviour from\nthe conventional type, it was called [67] zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR). The\nphysical reason for its being so different from NR behaviour is as follows: the variation\nof action\/energy in the vicinity of the extremum does not break the resonance with the\nexternal periodic driving, because d\u03c9\/dI \u2248 0 in the relevant range of actions\/energies.\nConsequently, the oscillation of action\/energy is typically significantly larger than in the\nconventional case d\u03c9\/dI 6= 0 while the oscillation of angle, on the contrary, is significantly\nsmaller.\nAs parameters (e.g. the frequency or amplitude of the external periodic driving) vary,\nthe transition between ZDNR and NR occurs [68] via the global bifurcation known as\nseparatrix reconnection [26,8] (Fig. 20).\nA further important step was the generalization of the concept of nonlinear resonance to\nthe (weakly) dissipative case. Though the constrained vibrations of dissipative systems\nhad been widely studied over many years (see e.g. [1,25]), their investigation by means\nof the nonlinear resonance technique, including in particular the topological analysis of\nbasins of attraction, was introduced more recently in [77,69]. Such an analysis has proved\nto be highly informative and important for a variety of applications [69\u201374,77\u201379].\nIn the dissipative case, a 2D dynamical system possesses attractors so that the phase space\nis divided into different basins of attraction, unlike the non-dissipative case (in which ellip-\ntic points and separatrices are relevant). At the same time, similarly to the non-dissipative\ncase, the difference in angle between the corresponding stable and unstable points (at-\ntractor and saddle respectively) is \u2248 0 and \u2248 pi, for ZDNR and NR respectively (cf. Figs.\n21(a,b) and Figs. 21(c-e) respectively). The dissipative analogue of the ZDNR\/NR tran-\nsition occurs [77,69] via the global bifurcation known as saddle connection [80], which is\nillustrated in Figs. 21(b,c).\nTypically, there are also other global bifurcations in the system. A detailed bifurcation\nanalysis for one characteristic example is presented in the next sub-section (mainly fol-\nlowing [70]). It should be noted that the global bifurcations may become particularly\nimportant if external noise is added, as indicated in [77,69,71] (see also sub-section 5.5\nbelow). The ZDNR\/NR transition also seems to play an important role in the onset of\ncertain chaotic attractors [73,74] (see also sub-section 4.4. below).\n40\n4.2 Bifurcation analysis\nOur goal will be to find and classify all the local and global bifurcations of (4.1.9) in\nthe space of the driving force parameters (h and \u03c9f ), keeping all other parameters fixed,\nincluding \u0393. We shall illustrate our general qualitative analysis by making numerical\ncalculations for a concrete example of a ZD system with particular types of periodic per-\nturbation and dissipative terms. Strictly, the analysis is applicable only for small h where\nthe averaging method is valid and (4.1.9) therefore provides an adequate approximation\nfor (4.1.1). In order that the most interesting bifurcations of (4.1.9) should occur in this\nrange, we must choose an example ZD system for which the variation of eigenfrequency in\nthe range of energies between Emin and the extremal energy (or, equivalently, for actions\nbetween zero and the extremal action) is much less than the frequency itself. We empha-\nsize, however, that the qualitative features of our analysis \u2013 and some of the quantitative\nones too in the range of small h \u2013 remain valid even if the latter condition is not satisfied.\nWe choose to consider the archetypal example of a ZD system provided by the tilted\nDuffing oscillator (see sub-section 2.3),\nH0(p, q) =\np2\n2\n+ U(q), (4.2.1)\nU(q) =\n1\n2\n\u03c920q\n2 +\n1\n3\n\u03b2q3 +\n1\n4\n\u03b3q4,\n9\n10\n<\n\u03b22\n\u03b3\u03c920\n< 4,\nwith \u03c90 = 1, \u03b2 = 5\/3, \u03b3 = 1 (cf. a similar U(q) in Fig. 9(a)). The dependence of \u03c9 on\nI is shown in Fig. 22: it exhibits a minimum of \u03c9m = 0.805 at Im = 0.187. As required,\nthe variation of eigenfrequency in the range I\n\u223c\n< Im is much less than the eigenfrequency\nitself in this range. The perturbation and the dissipative 22 terms, that we will consider\nare respectively\nV = \u2212q cos(\u03c9f t),\n(4.2.2)\nfq = 0, fp = p.\nThus, the original system becomes a nonlinear oscillator with cubic and quartic nonlin-\nearities subject to a cosine driving force and a linear friction,\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 + \u03c920q + \u03b2q\n2 + \u03b3q4 = h cos(\u03c9f t). (4.2.3)\n22 A linear friction reflects the most general properties of dissipation. We comment, however,\nthat more complicated behaviour is possible for dissipative terms of greater complexity, e.g. the\ncoexistence of attractors, repellers and regions of conservative motion [81]. We do not consider\nsuch cases here, because they lack generality, but it would be interesting to investigate them in\nthe future.\n41\nWe shall consider wf close to \u03c9m and the range of actions I \u223c Im so that n = 1 in (4.1.7)\nis relevant (l = 1 from the definition of the perturbation V in (4.2.2)) i.e. we shall consider\nthe nonlinear resonance of the 1st order.

The black lines indicate the onset\/disappearance of\nstable points. They have been obtained from the condition that the curves corresponding\nto the left-hand and right-hand sides of (4.2.7) touch, rather than cross, each other (cf.\nFig. 23).

The analysis demonstrates (cf. Fig. 24(b)) that, for \u0393 6= 0, the full line\nhas two cusps, whereas the dashed line has only one cusp. One can derive asymptotic\nformulae for the positions of the cusps.

Fig. 24(a)).\nWithin the region bounded by the full line (except very close to its right and left cusps),\npoint S1 in Fig. 2 is well separated in action from S2 and S3. The responses corresponding\nto S2 and S3 are always strongly nonlinear. The response corresponding to S1 is linear in\nthe region far below the upper part of the full line, although it becomes nonlinear as the\nline is approached. However, it remains significantly smaller than S2\/S3 and, in order to\ndistinguish S1 from S2\/S3, we shall refer to it as \u201clinear\u201d within the whole area within\nthe full line.\nThe full line of Fig. 24 bounds the region within which both the linear, and one or both of\nthe nonlinear, responses can exist: the upper part marks the boundary of linear response;\nand the lower part that of the nonlinear ones. The area between the upper and lower\nparts of the dashed line is the region where both nonlinear responses coexist. Note that,\nfor \u0393=0, the lower part of the dashed line merges into the part of the abscissa axis lying\nto the right of \u03c9m, while part of the full line merges into the segment of abscissa axis lying\nbetween \u03c9m and \u03c90.\nWe now carry out a global bifurcation analysis, treating the non-dissipative and dissipative\ncases separately in Secs. 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 respectively.\n4.2.2 Global bifurcation analysis for the non-dissipative case\nIn the non-dissipative case, equations (4.2.4) are purely Hamiltonian, so that the quasi-\nenergy H is conserved. Consequently, trajectories in the vicinity of stable points are closed\n(elliptic) orbits. Such regions are separated from each other, or from regions with open\ntrajectories, by separatrices that include unstable fixed points.\n44\nFigure 25 shows an example of how the phase space evolves with increase of the driving\nforce frequency. One can see the consequences of two global bifurcations: the topology\nof the separatrices changes between (a) and (b), and again between (b) and (c). These\nbifurcations are of the separatrix reconnection type [8]. The first one, which results from\na reconnection of the separatrices passing through the unstable fixed points marked 24 as\ng and o, respectively, is the ZDNR\/NR transition [68]: Fig. 25(a) represents the ZDNR\nstage, and Fig. 25(b) the NR one. This transition is indicated by the full green line on the\nbifurcation diagram, Fig. 24(a). The second bifurcation, between Figs. 25(b) and 25(c),\nresults from a reconnection of the separatrices passing through the points marked as g\nand o respectively. It is indicated by the yellow line in Fig. 24(a). Yet another possible\nreconnection may occur between the separatrices passing through the points marked as g\nand y respectively. It is indicated by the brown line in Fig. 24(a).\nThese three types of separatrix reconnection exhaust all possible types in the present case:\nthe maximum number of reconnections is equal to 25\nn(nondis)max = C\n2\n3 \u2261 3, (4.2.14)\nusing[82] the binomial coefficient Cij =\nj!\ni!(j\u2212i)! .\n4.2.3 Global bifurcation analysis for the dissipative case\nIn the dissipative case, the stable points are true attractors. Consequently, we have bound-\naries of basins of attraction (see Fig. 26) in place of the separatrices of the non-dissipative\ncase. These boundaries include unstable fixed points (either saddles or similar, but non-\nhyperbolic, points). Correspondingly, the separatrix reconnection of the non-dissipative\ncase is exchanged for the more general heteroclinic orbit [80], connecting unstable points.\nIt follows from the analysis of sub-section 4.2.1 (see eqs.(4.2.6)\u2013(4.2.8) and footnote 23)\nthat the maximum number of unstable fixed points is equal to 4. Note, however, that\nas in the non-dissipative case, the two unstable points with I=0 (see (4.2.6)) are always\nconnected to each other and, moreover, that the direction of their connection is always the\nsame. Thus, in the classification of heteroclinic orbits they should be considered a single\nunit. Note also that, unlike a separatrix reconnection, a heteroclinic orbit is characterised\nboth by a pair of connected points and by the direction of the connection. Thus, the\nmaximum number of different types of heteroclinic orbit in the system is\nn(dis)max = 2\u00d7 C23 \u2261 6. (4.2.15)\n24 In the original paper [70], on which the present sub-section is based, the unstable points were\nmarked in the corresponding figure by different colours. Here, being restricted financially, we\npresent the figure in black-and-white, using instead of the green, orange and yellow colours the\nmarkers g, o and y respectively.\n25 Although there are formally 4 types of unstable fixed point, the lower index of the binomial\ncoefficient in (4.2.15) is taken as 3 because both types of points marked as y (I = 0, \u03c8\u02dc = \u00b1pi\/2)\nare always connected by a separatrix and cannot be reconnected with other unstable points\nindependently of each other.\n45\nUsing the notation o, g respectively for the unstable fixed points corresponding to U1, U2\nin Fig. 23 (which are indicated in Fig. 26 by orange and green dots respectively), y for\npoints with I=0 (yellow dots in Fig. 26), and indicating the direction of a connection with\nan arrow, the set of possible heteroclinic orbits can be classified 26 as\n(1) o\u2192 g; (2) g \u2192 o;\n(3) o\u2192 y; (4) y \u2192 o; (4.2.16)\n(5) g \u2192 y; (6) y \u2192 g.\nWe now discuss each of them separately \u2013\n(1) o \u2192 g corresponds to the ZDNR\/NR transition [77,69,71], analogous to the corre-\nsponding transition in the non-dissipative case. This bifurcation is indicated by the\nfull green line in the bifurcation diagram Fig. 24(b).\n(2) g \u2192 o corresponds to the bifurcation between configurations where the basin of\nattraction of one of the nonlinear resonances encompasses the other one, or where it\npasses around it [77,69,71]. This type of bifurcation is indicated by the orange lines\nin Fig. 24(b) 27 . It has no analogue in the non-dissipative case.\n(3) o \u2192 y corresponds to the jump by 2pi of the end of the trajectory emerging from\nthe orange saddle, i.e. the jump between adjacent linear response attractors: see e.g.\nFigs. 26(a) and (b). This type of bifurcation is indicated by red lines in Fig. 24(b).\nIt has no analogue in the non-dissipative case.\n(4) y \u2192 o corresponds to the change between the boundary including the orange saddle\n(Fig. 26) encompassing either the nonlinear attractor(s) or linear attractor: see e.g.\nthe change between Figs. 26(b) and 26(c). This type of bifurcation is indicated by\nthe yellow line in Fig. 24(b). The analogous bifurcation for the non-dissipative case\nis shown by the yellow line in Fig. 24(a).\n(5) g \u2192 y corresponds to the jump by 2pi of the end of the trajectory emerging from the\ngreen saddle. The trajectory can end either in a linear response attractor, if the latter\nexists and if the trajectory is not trapped by the nonlinear response attractor (full\nblue lines in the bifurcation diagram Fig. 24(b)), or in a nonlinear one when linear\nresponse is encompassed by a red boundary (cf. Fig. 26(c)), or does not exist at all\n(dashed blue lines) 28 . This type of bifurcation has no analogue in the non-dissipative\ncase.\n(6) y \u2192 g is analogous to y \u2192 o. It is indicated in Fig. 24(b) by the brown line which\nstarts where the ZDNR\/NR line crosses the yellow line. Its non-dissipative analogue\nis shown by the brown line in Fig. 24(a).\nPoints where global bifurcation lines intersect or meet each other correspond to more\ncomplicated connections. These and other interesting features of the diagram (e.g. the\n26 We should note that the o, g points are saddles while the y points are non-hyperbolic unstable\nfixed points.\n27 For small enough \u0393, there will be additional orange lines in the ZDNR region, i.e. above the\nfull green line, but below the upper parts of the dashed and full black lines.\n28 For small enough \u0393, additional blue lines can exist above the green and brown lines, but below\nthe upper part of the dashed black line.\n46\nyellow staircase) would be interesting to study in the future in more detail.\n4.2.4 Discussion\nWe now discuss the characteristic differences between the bifurcation diagrams of ZD\nsystems, and those of the conventionally considered kind of system in which there is no\nextremum in the variation of eigenfrequency with energy or, equivalently, action. We also\nconsider the physical consequences that may be expected to result from the bifurcations\nof the averaged system discussed above.\nIt is immediately evident that a system with an extremum in \u03c9(I) is much richer in terms\nof bifurcations than a system without one. In fact, the only global bifurcation in the\nstandard system with monotonic \u03c9(I) is the one corresponding to the yellow lines of Fig.\n24 (cf. [83]). Most features of the local bifurcation lines (the cusps, separatrices, etc) are\npeculiar to the system with an extremum \u2013 the exception being the cusp near \u03c90 \u2261 \u03c9(0),\nwhich also exists for systems with monotonic \u03c9(I).\nWe now consider the physical significance of the various bifurcations.\nLocal bifurcations are important because they correspond to the onset\/disappearance of\nthe different regimes of oscillation and, unlike the case of monotonic \u03c9(I), three rather\nthan two regimes are typically possible. The overlap of resonances of different order leads\nto the onset of global chaos in the non-dissipative case [5] (see also sub-section 4.3 below)\nand may lead to the onset of chaotic attractors in the dissipative case [72\u201374] (see also\nsub-section 4.4 below).\nGlobal bifurcations in the absence of dissipation have two main effects. On the one hand,\nthey change certain topological properties of the slow dynamics (an example of such\nchanges in the Poincare\u00b4 section is shown in Fig. 27); and, on the other hand, they result\nin changes in the structure of the chaotic layers associated with nonlinear resonances (cf.\n[75,71] as well as sub-section 4.3.1 below) and facilitate chaotic transport (cf. [76] as well\nas subsection 4.3.2 below).\nGlobal bifurcations in the presence of dissipation may play some role in the onset of\nchaotic attractors [73,74] (see also sub-section 4.4 below). They also play an important\nrole in the case when the system is additionally driven by a weak noise 29 . Indeed, if\nthe noise is weak, then fluctuational transitions occur with overwhelming probability via\nunstable fixed points (see e.g. [2\u20134] as well as sub-section 5.4 below). Thus their connec-\ntions should influence profoundly the fluctuational transitions between attractors of the\ndynamical system. Those that occur via yellow points (Fig. 26), however, result only in\na change of the angle by 2pi which is usually not observable in physical systems 30 . In\n29 Given that noise in real systems is always associated with dissipation, only the dissipative\n(rather than the non-dissipative) case is relevant to the problem of fluctuations.\n30 There are, however, circumstances in which these transitions could be both observable and\nimportant. For example, phase slips of this kind represent highly undesirable events in voltage\nstandards based on SQUIDs, and in memory cells [15], so that it is important to understand\ntheir probability.\n47\nrelation to fluctuational transitions, therefore, the most important global bifurcations are\nthose that do not involve the yellow points, i.e. the ZDNR\/NR transition (o \u2192 g) and\nthe encompassing\/passing-around transition (g \u2192 o). Of these two, the ZDNR\/NR tran-\nsition is of particular interest: first because the most pronounced change in fluctuational\ntransition rates is to be expected; and, secondly, because the associated repopulation of\nthe nonlinear resonances for small h gives rise to dramatic characteristic changes in the\nfluctuation spectra [77,71] (see also sub-section 5.5 below).\nGiven the importance of the ZDNR\/NR transition, we present below the asymptotic\nformula for the frequency \u03c9\n(tr)\nf \u2261 \u03c9(tr)f (h) at which the transition occurs [69] (valid both\nfor the dissipative and non-dissipative cases, beyond the close vicinity of the cusp):\n\u03c9\n(tr)\nf = \u03c9m + sgn(\u03c9\n\u2032\u2032\nm)(|\u03c9\u2032\u2032m|\/2)\n1\n3\n[\n3\n2\nhq1(Im){(1\u2212 \u03b72) 12 \u2212 \u03b7(pi\n2\n\u2212 arcsin(\u03b7))}\n] 2\n3\n,(4.2.17)\n\u03b7 \u2261 \u0393Im\nhq1(Im)\n< 1,\n[\n\u0393\n|\u03c9\u2032\u2032m|I2m\n] 2\n3\n\u001c\n\uf8ee\uf8f0\u03c9(tr)f \u2212 \u03c9m\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032mI2m\n\uf8f9\uf8fb 12 \u001c 1.\n4.3 Chaos in the absence of dissipation\nDescribing in the previous sub-sections of Sec. 4 the slow dynamics of the periodically\ndriven system, we neglected fast-oscillating terms in dynamical equations for action I and\nfor the shift of the angle from the angle of the periodic driving, \u03c8\u02dc. Provided the periodic\ndriving (perturbation) is weak, such neglect is justified throughout the major part of\nthe phase space: the fast-oscillating terms have only a slight effect on the motion [41].\nHowever in the absence of dissipation, there are necessarily regions in the phase space\nwhere the influence of the fast-oscillating terms is inherently important, however weak\nthe periodic perturbation is: the thin layers around the separatrices of the slow dynamics\nare necessarily chaotic [5,35,60]: it is called local chaos [5,35,60]. The width and some\nother features of the layer are described by the corresponding separatrix map. However,\nthe separatrix maps for conventional NR [5,35,60] and ZDNR [75,71] are quite different.\nCorrespondingly, the widths of the layers and their structure on the whole are different as\nwell. Some initial analytic and numerical study of local chaos in ZDNR has been reported\n[75,71] and is described below in sub-section 4.3.1.\nIf the amplitude of the perturbation grows the width of the layers grows as well and,\nat some stage, different layers merge, which typically marks the onset of global chaos\n[5,35,60], characterized by a chaotic motion within a large region of the phase space.\nHowever the onset of global chaos in ZD systems has distinct differences [75,71,76] from\nthis scenario, which are described below in sub-section 4.3.2.\n4.3.1 Local chaos in ZDNR\nWe shall derive the separatrix maps for ZDNR by following the same scheme as was used\nin [35] for the case of the conventional NR. For the sake of brevity and clarity, we shall\n48\nassume some simplification for the periodic perturbation. Namely, we shall consider the\ncase when V\u02dc in (4.1.5) has only the term corresponding to l = n = 1. Moreover, we shall\nassume that V\n(1)\n1 does not depend on I. In fact, these simplifications are often still valid\nin a more general case (at least if one considers the 1st-order resonance, i.e. the range\nof I where (4.1.7) holds for l = n = 1). As for other cases, the results can readily be\ngeneralized and, at the end of the present sub-section, we shall outline how this may be\ndone.\nSo, let us now consider the perturbed Hamiltonian (cf. (4.1.5))\nH = H\u02dc0(I) + hV\n(1)\n1 cos(\u03c8 + \u03b21)cos(\u03c9f t+ \u03b11), (4.3.1)\nwhere H\u02dc0(I) is a Hamiltonian of some ZD system, i.e. the eigenfrequency \u03c9(I) \u2261 \u2202H\u02dc0\/\u2202I\npossesses a maximum or a minimum at some action Im.\nThe dynamics of the action I and slow angle (4.1.8) (note that l = n = 1 in our case) are\nalso Hamiltonian:\nI\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202(H + V )\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n,\n(4.3.2)\n\u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 =\n\u2202(H + V )\n\u2202I\n,\nH =\nI\u222b\n0\ndI\u02dc (\u03c9(I\u02dc)\u2212 \u03c9f ) + h\n2\nV\n(1)\n1 cos(\u03c8\u02dc),\nV =\n1\n2\nhV\n(1)\n1 cos(\u03c8\u02dc + 2\u03c9f t+ 2\u03b11).\nIt should be emphasized that, unlike (4.1.9) (where averaging was used), the Hamiltonian\nH + V (4.3.2) is strictly equivalent to (4.3.1).\nLet us consider the dynamics of the averaged energy E \u2261 H,\nE\u02d9 = [H, (H + V )] = [H, V ] = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202I\n\u2202V\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n. (4.3.3)\nThe brackets [...] imply Poisson brackets [1], and \u03c8\u02dc, I are respectively the generalized\ncoordinate and momentum for the system (4.3.2).\nLet us consider the motion near one of the separatrices related to the averaged Hamiltonian\nH(I, \u03c8\u02dc) (4.3.2). Typical \u201cunperturbed\u201d (i.e. at V = 0) trajectories are shown in Fig.\n19(b). Apart from the separatrix itself, there are three different types of such unperturbed\ntrajectory: (i) trajectories inside any of the loops of the separatrix; (ii) those outside the\nloops, passing the part of the separatrix connecting saddles on the side opposite to the\n49\nloops (in the case shown in Fig. 19(b), such trajectories pass below the loops); and (iii)\nthose outside the loops, passing the part of the separatrix connecting saddles on the same\nside as the loops (in the case shown in Fig. 19(b), such trajectories pass above the loops).\nThe most important feature of such trajectories in the present context is that the system\nremains near the saddles for most of time , where \u2202H\/\u2202I = 0 by definition. Characteristic\nexamples of the dependence of \u2202H\/\u2202I on time along a perturbed trajectory are shown in\nFig. 28. Such a dependence consists of a succession of relatively short pulses between\nwhich \u2202H\/\u2202I rests nearly at zero. The pulses repeat each other and the corresponding\npulses on the \u201cunperturbed\u201d trajectories nearly identically 31 . The duration of each pulse,\nTp, is of the order of the period of eigenoscillation in the local minimum of the averaged\nHamiltonian H(I, \u03c8\u02dc),\nTp \u223c \u03c9\u02dc\u221210 , (4.3.4)\n\u03c9\u02dc0 \u2261\n\u221a\nhV\n(1)\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032m(\u03c9f \u2212 \u03c9m)\/2.\nThe intervals between successive pulses are much longer than their duration, and depend\nstrongly on the \u201cenergy\u201d E, which almost does not change during the intervals between\npulses: it follows from (4.3.3) that the major change of E occurs during a pulse of \u2202H\/\u2202I.\nAs E approaches its value on the separatrix, which is equal in the case of H to\nEs =\nIr\u222b\n0\ndI\u02dc (\u03c9(I\u02dc)\u2212 \u03c9f )\u00b1 h\n2\nV\n(1)\n1 cos(\u03c8\u02dc), \u03c9(Ir) \u2261 \u03c9f , (4.3.5)\nthen the interval between the pulses on the unperturbed trajectory (i.e. at V = 0 in\n(4.3.2)) diverges, being described by the asymptotic formula 32\nTint \u2261 Tint(|E \u2212 Es|) \u2248 (pi\u03c9\u02dc0)\u22121 ln( hV\n(1)\n1\n|E \u2212 Es|), (4.3.6)\n|E \u2212 Es|\/(hV (1)1 )\u001c 1.\nLet us now turn namely to the construction of the separatrix map. With this aim, we\nshall transform from the description of the system in terms of I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc to the equivalent\ndescription in terms of \u201cenergy\u201d E and time t. Let us characterize the dynamics by a series\nof pairs of these quantities (Ek, tk) chosen just before pulses of \u2202H\/\u2202I and enumerated\nin increasing time: see Fig. 28. The map relating each pair to the previous one is different\nfor different regions in the vicinity of the separatrix.\n31 In the case of motion similar to type (iii) described above, two different types of the pulse\nalternate: cf. Fig. 28(c).\n32 In the range of non-small |E \u2212 Es|\/(hV (1)1 ), the dependence of Tint on E is different for the\ndifferent types of trajectory described above. The dependences reduce to the same asymptote,\nhowever, as E \u2192 Es.\n50\n1. For the trajectories inside or below 33 the loop (Figs. 28(a) and 28(b) respectively),\nEk+1 \u2248 Ek + \u2206E(1,2)k ,\n(4.3.7)\ntk+1 \u2248 tk + Tint|E=Ek+1 ,\nwhere\n\u2206E\n(1,2)\nk = \u2212\ntk+\u2206t\u222b\ntk\ndt\n(\n\u2202H\n\u2202I\n)(1,2) (\n\u2202V\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n)(1,2)\n, (4.3.8)\nand the superscripts (1) and (2) relate to the trajectories respectively inside and below\nthe loops, while \u2206t is chosen so that\nTp \u2264 \u2206t \u2264 Tint|E=Ek+1 . (4.3.9)\n\u2206Ek is almost independent of \u2206t within the range (4.3.9). The dependence on Ek is also\nvery weak, so that it may be calculated approximately along the corresponding piece\nof separatrix: along the loop, for the trajectories inside the loop; and along the section\nconnecting adjacent saddles, for the trajectories below the loops. We now substitute\nV (4.3.2) into (4.3.8), allow for the fact that, on the separatrix, \u2202H\/\u2202I and \u03c8\u02dc are\nrespectively even and odd functions of t\u2212(tk+Tp\/2) 34 (see Figs. 28(a,b)), and introduce\nthe auxiliary variable\n\u03d5k \u2261 2\u03c9f (tk + Tp\/2) + 2\u03b11 (4.3.10)\n(which represents twice the angle of the perturbation taken at the instant when the\npulse of \u2202H\/\u2202I passes its centre). We thus obtain\n\u2206E\n(1,2)\nk = \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns sin(\u03d5k), (4.3.11)\n\u2206E\n(1,2)\ns =\nh\n2\nV\n(1)\n1\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt\n(\n\u2202H\n\u2202I\n)(1,2)\ns\ncos(\u03c8\u02dc(1,2)s (t) + 2\u03c9f t),\nwhere the s subscript means that all dynamical functions are to be evaluated on the\nseparatrix, while the zero of t is chosen so that it marks the centre of the corresponding\npulse of \u2202H\/\u2202I which implies, in particular, that \u03c8\u02dcs(0) = 0 or \u03c8\u02dcs(0) = pi, for the\nsuperscript (1) or (2) respectively. Given that the characteristic time-scale of the pulse\nTp \u223c \u03c9\u02dc\u221210 \u001d \u03c9\u22121f , the quantities \u2206E(1,2)s are exponentially small, i.e. \u221d exp(\u2212a\u03c9f\/\u03c9\u02dc0)\nwhere a is some positive number \u223c 1 (cf. the case of the chaotic layer for the pendulum\n[5,35,60]). The explicit expressions have not so far been found.\n33 Here and in the rest of sub-section 4.3.1, we shall refer for the sake of clarity just to the\nseparatrix shown in Fig. 19(b), in which the loops are directed \u201cup\u201d; correspondingly, the types\nof trajectory referred to above as \u201c(ii)\u201d or \u201c(iii)\u201d will be described for the sake of brevity as\nbeing below or above the loops respectively.\n34 The instant t\u2212 (tk + Tp\/2) relates to the centre of the corresponding pulse \u2202H\/\u2202I(t) and, at\nthe same time, to \u03c8\u02dc being equal to either 0 or pi, depending on the type of separatrix and on\nthe relevant bit of the separatrix (cf. Fig. 19(b)).\n51\nUsing also the asymptotic expression (4.3.6) for Tint, we derive the final represen-\ntation of the ZDNR separatrix map for trajectories either inside or below any of the\nseparatrix loops, they are distinguished below by means of the superscripts, (1) and (2)\nrespectively:\nE\n(1,2)\nk+1 = E\n(1,2)\nk + \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns sin(\u03d5\n(1,2)\nk ),\n(4.3.12)\n\u03d5\n(1,2)\nk+1 = \u03d5\n(1,2)\nk + A ln\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed B\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223E(1,2)k \u2212 Es + \u2206E(1,2)s sin(\u03d5(1,2)k )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nA =\n2\u03c9f\npi\u03c9\u02dc0\n, B = hV\n(1)\n1 .\nThe general form of these maps coincides with the conventional separatrix map [5,35,60].\nThe difference lies only in the coefficients \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns , A, B. It is well known [5,35,60] that,\nif |E \u2212 Es| is large enough, then all iterations of the map are rather regular. But if E\nlies within a layer around Es of width \u223c \u2206E(1,2)s then the motion becomes chaotic i.e.\n(Ek, \u03d5k) change from one iteration to the next in a seemingly random manner.\n2. For the trajectories above the loop, the two different shapes of pulses of \u2202H\/\u2202I alternate\n(Fig. 28(c)). Correspondingly, it is convenient to consider two series, (E\n(1)\nk , \u03d5\n(1)\nk ) and\n(E\n(2)\nk , \u03d5\n(2)\nk ), relating to the different types of pulses. In order to obtain a closed map for\neach of the series, one should make two iterations, unlike the case of trajectories inside\nor below the loops (where just one iteration was enough). As a result, one obtains the\nfollowing maps for (E\n(1,2)\nk , \u03d5\n(1,2)\nk ).\nE\n(1,2)\nk+1 = E\n(1,2)\nk + \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns sin(\u03d5\n(1,2)\nk ) + (4.3.13)\n\u2206E\n(2,1)\ns sin\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\u03d5(1,2)k + A ln\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed B\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223E(1,2)k \u2212 Esep + \u2206E(1,2)s sin(\u03d5(1,2)k )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\n\u03d5\n(1,2)\nk+1 = \u03d5\n(1,2)\nk + A ln\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed B2\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223E(1,2)k \u2212 Es + \u2206E(1,2)s sin(\u03d5k)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223E(1,2)k+1 \u2212 Es\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\nThough these maps are more complicated than the maps (4.3.12), their major quali-\ntative feature, namely chaos in a thin layer near the separatrix, is similar: the series\n(E\n(1,2)\nk , \u03d5\n(1,2)\nk ) change in a random-like fashion if E deviates from Es for values smaller\nthan some critical value \u223c max(\u2206E(1)s ,\u2206E(2)s ).\nIt is obvious that the derivation of the separatrix maps (4.3.12), (4.3.13) for the system\n(4.3.1) can be easily generalized for a more general perturbation. Indeed, the perturba-\ntion\u2019s independence of I is not fundamental: if V\n(1)\n1 depends on I, the corrections to the\nmaps can be shown to be typically exponentially smaller than principal terms. For a per-\nturbation that has more than one harmonic, a situation can arise such that the term which\nmakes the major contribution to the slow dynamics, and the term playing the major role\n52\nin the formation of the chaotic layer, are not the same. To obtain the correct map, one\nshould keep in the non-resonant perturbation V the term of smallest possible frequency\nsince other terms result only in exponentially smaller contributions: cf. the estimation\nof \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns (\u03c9f ) above. For example, if the original perturbation (i.e. the perturbation in\n(4.3.1)) had also a 2nd harmonic, hV\n(2)\n1 (I)cos(2\u03c8 + \u03b22)cos(\u03c9f t+ \u03b11), then the perturba-\ntion in the representation (4.3.2) would have in particular a term \u221d cos(2\u03c8\u02dc + \u03c9f t). The\nfrequency of oscillation of this term is less than half that of the term \u221d V (1)1 (cf. (4.3.2)),\nand hence its effect on the formation of the chaotic layer would be exponentially larger.\nWe emphasize at the same time that the general forms of the ZDNR separatrix maps (i.e.\n(4.3.13) and two first lines in (4.3.12)) are the same for all types of perturbation; only the\ncoefficients (i.e. A, B, \u2206E\n(1,2)\ns ) depend on the detailed form of the perturbation.\nThus, we may conclude from this sub-section that, though there is much in common in\nthe origins of the local chaos in ZDNR and NR, the chaotic layers are very different: the\ndependences of their widths on the parameters of perturbation are significantly different\nin the cases of NR and ZDNR. Unlike the conventional (NR) case, the layers in ZDNR\nare strongly asymmetric, and probably strongly inhomogeneous, because their different\nparts are described by different maps. It would be interesting to study them in detail,\nboth analytically and numerically.\nSome very preliminary studies of the chaotic layers associated with ZDNR were reported\nin [75,71]. Numerical studies of local chaos in nonmonotonic twist maps are described in\n[8\u201310,64\u201366].\n4.3.2 Global chaos\nGlobal chaos, i.e. chaos throughout a large region of the phase space, is conventionally\ntaken to occur when at least two nonlinear resonances overlap in energy: this is the essence\nof the celebrated empirical Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion [5,35,60]. However, global\nchaos may arise differently in ZD systems: if the resonances are of the same order, then\nneither their overlap in energy, nor even their overlap in phase space, need necessarily\nresult in the onset of global chaos; rather, the overlap in phase space results in recon-\nnection of the thin chaotic layers associated with the resonances while, as the amplitude\nof the periodic perturbation grows further, the layers separate again but with a different\ntopology: cf. Fig. 29(a).\nFor global chaos to occur in a ZD system, nonlinear resonances of different order should\noverlap (in energy), which typically requires a much stronger perturbation than for the\noverlap of resonances of the same order: cf. Fig. 29(a) and Fig. 29(b).\nOn the other hand, it can happen in a ZD system that the overlap in energy between\ndifferent-order resonances, and the overlap in the phase space between resonances of the\nsame order, are combined resulting in the onset of global chaos, either in a very pronounced\nform, or at unusually small amplitudes of perturbation. We demonstrate this in detail for\na system with more than one separatrix, since the effect is at its most pronounced in\n53\nprecisely such systems. Moreover, if the system is periodic, then the effect provides a\ndrastic increase of the accessible energy range in unbounded chaotic transport.\nOur presentation mostly follows the work [76]. So, as an example of a Hamiltonian system\npossessing more than one separatrix, consider (2.2.5)-(2.2.6) with \u03a6 < 1 (Fig. 5(a)),\nwhich describes e.g. a 2D electron gas in a one-dimensional periodic magnetic field [20,21]\n(see also sub-section 2.2 above). The separatrices in the momentum-coordinate plane are\nshown in Fig. 30: they correspond to motion with energies equal to the corresponding\nbarrier heights. The eigenfrequency possesses a local maximum (\u03c9m \u2248 0.43) as a function\nof energy\/action: see Fig. 5(c). If, additionally, a periodic electric force is applied in the\nsame direction as that in which the magnetic field is periodic, then the system is equivalent\nto a Hamiltonian one with an additive time-periodic perturbation,\np\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202(H + V )\n\u2202q\n, q\u02d9 =\n\u2202(H + V )\n\u2202p\n,\nH = p2\/2 + (\u03a6\u2212 sin(q))2\/2, \u03a6 = 0.2, (4.3.14)\nV = \u2212hq cos(\u03c9f t).\nLet us first consider the evolution of chaos as h grows while \u03c9f remains fixed at some\narbitrarily chosen value beyond the immediate vicinity of \u03c9m and its harmonics. It is well\nillustrated by Fig. 31. At small h, there are two thin chaotic layers, around the inner\nand outer separatrices of the undriven system. Note that unbounded chaotic transport\ntakes place only in the outer chaotic layer i.e. in a narrow energy range. As h grows,\nso also do the layers until, at some (typically non-small) critical value hgc \u2261 hgc(\u03c9f ),\nthey merge. This event may be considered as the onset of global chaos: the whole range\nof energies between the barriers heights then becomes involved in unbounded chaotic\ntransport. Note that the states {I(l)} \u2261 {p = 0, q = pi\/2 + 2pil} and {O(l)} \u2261 {p =\n0, q = \u2212pi\/2 + 2pil} (where l = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, ...) in the stroboscopic (for instants n2pi\/\u03c9f\nwith n = 0, 1, 2, ...) Poincare\u00b4 section are associated respectively with the inner and outer\nsaddles of the undriven system, and necessarily belong to the inner and outer chaotic\nlayers respectively. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for global chaos to arise\nin our system may be formulated e.g. as the possibility of the system placed initially in\nthe state {I(0)} passing beyond the neighbouring \u201couter\u201d states, {O(0)} and {O(1)}, i.e.\nthe possibility of q(t\u001d 2pi\/\u03c9f ) becoming smaller than \u2212pi\/2 or larger than 3pi\/2.\nA diagram in the h \u2212 \u03c9f plane, based on the above criterion, is shown in Fig. 32. The\nlower boundary of the shaded area represents the function hgc(\u03c9f ). It has deep cusp-like\nminima (spikes) at frequencies \u03c9f = \u03c9\n(n)\ns that are slightly less than the odd multiples of\n\u03c9m,\n\u03c9(n)s \u2248 \u03c9m(2n\u2212 1), n = 1, 2, ... (4.3.15)\nThe deepest minimum occurs at \u03c9(1)s \u2248 \u03c9m: hgc(\u03c9(1)s ) is approximately 40 times smaller\nthan in the neighbouring pronounced local maximum of hgc(\u03c9f ) at \u03c9f \u2248 1. As n increases,\nthe corresponding minimum becomes less deep. The origin of the spikes becomes obvious\nfrom the analysis of the evolution of the Poincare\u00b4 section as h grows while \u03c9f \u2248 \u03c9(1)s . For\n54\nh = 0.001, one can see in Fig. 33(a) four chaotic trajectories: those associated with the\ninner and outer separatrices of the undriven system [5,35,60] are coloured green and blue\nrespectively, while the trajectories associated with the nonlinear resonances of the 1st\norder [5,35,60] (cf. sub-section 4.3.1) are indicated 35 by red and cyan (the corresponding\nattractors are indicated respectively by crosses of the same colours). Examples of non-\nchaotic (often called KAM [5,35,60]) trajectories separating the chaotic ones are shown\nin brown. As h increases to h = 0.003 (Fig. 33(b)), the blue and red chaotic trajectories\nmerge: the resulting trajectory is shown in blue. As h increases further (see Fig. 33(c),\nwhere h = 0.00475), the latter trajectory merges with the cyan chaotic trajectory (the\nresulting trajectory is shown by blue) and, finally, as h increases slightly more (see Fig.\n33(d), where h = 0.0055), the latter trajectory merges with the green trajectory 36 , so\nthat the inner well becomes involved in unbounded chaotic transport, thereby marking\nthe onset of global chaos in our system, as defined above.\nThe chaotic character of motion on the trajectory associated with the separatrix of the\nundriven system can be considered [60] to be a consequence of the overlap of high-order\nresonances (in the case shown in Fig. 33(a), the relevant orders are 3, 5, 7, ...). The\nscenario described above for the onset of global chaos therefore corresponds exactly to\nthe combination of an overlap between resonances of different orders (1, 3, 5, ...) and an\noverlap between resonances of the same (1st) order. The latter overlap is also illustrated\nby Fig. 34 showing the evolution of the separatrices of the 1st-order resonances calculated\nin the resonance approximation (cf. sub-sections 4.1, 4.2).\nNear the spikes, the function hgc(\u03c9f ) may be quite well approximated using the resonance\napproximation. The explicit asymptotic (for \u03a6\u2192 0) formulae for the minima themselves,\nin the lowest order of the parameters of smallness, are as follows:\n\u03c9(n)s \u2248 (2n\u2212 1)\u03c9m \u2248\n(2n\u2212 1)pi\n2 ln( 8\n\u03a6\n)\n, n = 1, 2, ..., \u03a6\u001c 1, (4.3.16)\nhgc(\u03c9\n(n)\ns ) \u2248\n(2n\u2212 1)\n24\n\u03a63 ln(\n8\n\u03a6\n), n = 1, 2, ..., 2n\u2212 1\u001c ln( 8\n\u03a6\n). (4.3.17)\nThe values of \u03c9(n)s obtained from simulations at \u03a6 = 0.2 (see Fig. 32) are in a good\nagreement with the formula (4.3.16). As concerns the values of hgc(\u03c9\n(n)\ns ), the value \u03a6 = 0.2\nis too large for Eq. (4.3.17) to be valid but, even so, Eq. (4.3.17) provides the correct order\nof magnitude for hgc(\u03c9\n(1)\ns ) and hgc(\u03c9\n(2)\ns ) (see Fig. 32). More accurate numerical calculations\nwithin the resonance approximation yield the value hgc(\u03c9\n(1)\ns ) \u2248 0.005, which practically\ncoincides with the value measured in simulations.\nIt is worth mentioning two examples of physical applications\n35 The chaotic layers associated with nonlinear resonances are extremely narrow at the given\nparameters, so that their width is much less than the diameters of dots indicating the trajectories\nin the figure.\n36 In the figure, we still use two colours for the different parts of this trajectory in order to\ndemonstrate that their mixing occurs very slowly, which indicates that the given h is just slightly\nabove the critical value hgc.\n55\n(1) The jump-wise increases of the range of energies involved in the unbounded chaotic\ntransport of electric charge carriers in a magnetic superlattice result in jump-wise\nincreases of the dc conductivity [20].\n(2) A significant decrease of the activation energy for noise-induced multi-barrier escape\nin the presence of periodic driving is associated with the onset of the possibility of\nnoise-free transport from the lower barrier to beyond the upper barrier (cf. [119] and\nsub-sections 5.3.2,5.3.3 above).\nThere are two immediate generalizations:\n(1) The absence of pronounced spikes at the even harmonics (i.e. at 2n\u03c9m) in the case\nconsidered above is explained by the fact that q2n = 0 due to the symmetry of the\npotential (2.2.6) and, correspondingly, that there are no resonances of even order; for\na non-symmetric potential, even-order resonances do exist so that spikes in hgc(\u03c9f )\nat \u03c9f \u2248 2n\u03c9m exist also.\n(2) If the time-periodic driving is multiplicative rather than additive, then the resonances\nbecome parametric (cf. [1]). Parametric resonance is more complicated and much less\nstudied than nonlinear resonance. But, still, the major mechanism for the onset of\nglobal chaos remains the same, namely the combination of the reconnection between\nresonances of the same order and of their overlap in energy with the chaotic layers\nassociated with the barriers. At the same time, the frequencies of the major spikes\nin hgc(\u03c9f ) are twice as large as those of the corresponding spikes in the case of the\nadditive driving: this is because the characteristic frequencies of parametric resonance\nare typically doubled as compared with the nonlinear resonance (cf. [1]). Thus, if the\nparameter \u03a6 in U(q) (2.2.6) is periodically driven (which may correspond e.g. to the\ntime-periodic electric force being perpendicular to the direction of the periodicity of\nthe magnetic field [21]) i.e. if the full Hamiltonian is\nH = p2\/2 + (\u03a6\u2212 sin(q))2\/2, \u03a6 = \u03a60 + h cos(\u03c9f t), \u03a60 = const, (4.3.18)\nthen one may expect for major spikes in hgc(\u03c9f ) to occur at the frequencies\n\u03c9(n)sp \u2248 2\u03c9(n)s \u2248 2(2n\u2212 1)\u03c9m, n = 1, 2, ..., (4.3.19)\nwhich agrees well with results of simulations [76].\n4.4 Chaos in the presence of dissipation\n4.4.1 Introduction\nThe system (4.2.3) has 1.5 degrees of freedom and, therefore [80,60], it can be chaotic if\nthe driving amplitude h is large enough . It has indeed been established that there are\nmany regions in the plane of the driving force parameters where the motion is chaotic i.e.\nwhere positive Lyapunov exponents exist at least within some part of the phase space: see\nFig. 35 [71]. Chaotic attractors corresponding to the chaotic motion are strange [80,60]\nattractors and, as in many other (not necessarily ZD) periodically driven systems, they\nmay look quite different depending on the region of the parameter space and of the\n56\nphase space (see examples e.g. below in Fig. 39(a.8,b.7)). But the remarkable feature of\nthe ZD system (4.2.3) is that there is a chaotic band at unusually small amplitudes of\nthe driving force. It was noticed in [71] that this chaotic band lies within the 1st-order\nresonance region 37 (see Fig. 35). It was further noticed in [72] that the chaotic band\nlies within the intersection between the 1st-order and 2nd-order regions. Furthermore,\nthe evolution of Poincare\u00b4 sections in the relevant region of the driving force parameters\nwas studied thoroughly, leading to the inference that chaos in this parameter range could\nbe attributed to some rather simple empirical criteria for the onset of chaos in weakly\ndissipative systems being met [73]. These criteria may be considered as being, in a sense,\na generalization to weakly dissipative systems of the Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion\nin Hamiltonian systems [5,35,60]. The criteria constitute a very remarkable result. They\nare applicable to an arbitrary system, not just to ZD systems 38 . However, our very recent\n(though incomplete) studies [74] have shown that, as the damping (dissipation) parameter\nbecomes very small, the criteria fail: the chaotic regions in the parameter plane shrink\nnotwithstanding that the bifurcations (period-doubling, etc.) which precede the onset to\nchaos at moderately small damping are still well described by our criteria. Given the\ngenerality and potential importance of these criteria, it will be necessary to study them\nover a wider range of damping and to establish their limits of validity. The fundamental\norigins of the criteria may be explicable by mathematicians and we hope, therefore, that\nthis section will attract their attention.\nWe now present in sub-section 4.4.2 the major results of [73], for the case of some mod-\nerately small damping, while sub-section 4.4.3 is devoted to more recent results [74] for\nthe case of very small damping and outlines possible future directions of the research.\n4.4.2 Empirical criteria for the onset of chaos in weakly dissipative periodically driven\nsystems. The case of moderately small damping\nLet us first consider the resonance approximation (4.2.4) for n = 1, 2 (i.e. the resonances\nof the 1st and 2nd orders) for the system (4.2.3) with \u0393 =0.05, \u03c90 =0.5924, \u03b2 =1.026,\n\u03b3 =1. Fig. 36 shows the relevant bifurcation lines in the relevant area of the h\u2212\u03c9f plane.\nFig. 37 illustrates the ZDNR\/NR transition for the 2nd-order resonance (the dashed line\nin Fig. 36): the figures (a) and (b) correspond to the NR and ZDNR stages respectively.\nAnalogously to the 1st-order resonance, the basin of attraction of the larger-action at-\ntractor encompasses that of the smaller-action attractor, in the ZDNR stage, while it is\nvice versa in the NR stage.\nLet us now turn to the full system (4.2.3) to study its chaos (in the lowest chaotic band\n37 It was wrongly suggested, though, that the chaos probably related to global bifurcations of\nthe 1st-order resonance regime.\n38 But the range of their validity is probably at its largest precisely in ZD systems. Furthermore,\nthe criteria work most efficiently in ZD systems, because the amplitudes of the driving force at\nwhich the different-order resonances overlap in energy, either with each other or with a linear\nresponse, are typically much smaller in ZD systems than in other systems. Thus the accuracy\nof the resonance and linear response approximations (which are used in the criteria) is larger in\nZD systems than in others.\n57\nin the h\u2212 \u03c9f plane) and the routes to its onset. Fig. 38 shows the relevant chaotic band\ntogether with various bifurcation lines, as well as lines found in the resonance approxima-\ntions and lines related to the interaction between resonances. There are two different types\nof chaotic attractor 39 (cf. Fig. 39). The corresponding regions of parameters practically\ndo not overlap. For the sake of brevity, we will refer to them as to chaos-1 and chaos-2.\nAs h increases, the chaotic attractor corresponding to chaos-1 (cf. Fig. 39(a.7)) is born via\na sequence of period-doubling bifurcations from the larger-amplitude period-2 attractor\n(which corresponds to the larger-action 2nd-order resonance). With further increase of\nh, the chaotic attractor grows and, when h reaches the crisis line, the attractor touches\nthe boundary of attraction of the 1st-order resonance and vanishes discontinuously (Figs.\n39(a.8,9)).\nThe chaotic attractor corresponding to chaos-2 (cf. Fig. 39(b.6)) is born via a sequence of\nperiod-doubling bifurcations from the smaller-amplitude period-2 attractor (the smaller-\naction 2nd-order resonance). With further increase of h, destruction of the chaotic attrac-\ntor and a reverse sequence of period-doubling bifurcations occur (Figs. 39(b.8,9)).\nIt is seen that the chaos-1 and chaos-2 regions can be roughly delineated using simple cri-\nteria related to interactions between oscillatory regimes of different frequencies calculated\neither in the resonance or in the linear response approximations.\nChaos-1 is bounded by the lines 1-2-3-1. It is based on the inference that the origin of\nchaos-1 lies in a strong interaction between the larger-amplitude period-1 and period-2\nregimes of oscillation (larger-action nonlinear resonances of the 1st and 2nd order re-\nspectively), which seems to correlate with the evolution of the Poincare\u00b4 section. The line\n1-2 corresponds to a Chirikov-like overlap in energy between the larger-action 2nd-order\nresonance and the 1st-order nonlinear resonance. The line 1-3 corresponds to the lowest\naction on the boundary of the 1st-order nonlinear resonance becoming equal to the action\nof the larger-action attractor of the 2nd-order resonance: this line approximately bounds\nthe crisis of the chaotic attractor. The line 2-3 (ZDNR\/NR) bounds the chaos-1 region\nfrom the right. The seeming relevance of this line is based on the following argument.\nIn the nearby parameter region, an overlap between the larger-action 2nd-order and 1st-\norder resonances is possible only in the ZDNR stage: in the NR stage, the basin of the\nlarger-action 2nd-order resonance is encompassed by the basin of the smaller-action 2nd-\norder resonance (see Fig. 37(a) and Fig. 39(a.3)) which prevents an overlap of the former\nbasin with that of the 1st-order resonance. We note that, as the parameter \u03b2 decreases so\nthat the minimum of \u03c9(E) becomes shallower, disappearing at \u03b2 \u2248 0.562, the area of the\ndelineated region quickly decreases (cf. Fig. 40) until it vanishes, which nicely correlates\nwith shrinkage of the chaos-1 region and with its ultimate disappearance at \u03b2 \u2248 0.8.\nChaos-2 is bounded very roughly by the lines 4-5-6-7-4. Though the delineation is much\nless accurate than for chaos-1, it still seems to provide a good guess as to approximately\nwhere chaos-2 may be expected and, moreover, the shrinking of the delineated region\n39 It should be mentioned that one of these was observed in experiments on electrical circuits\nand also obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion [85]. However, no attempt\nwas made in [85] to relate the attractor to the overlap of nonlinear resonances.\n58\nas \u03b2 decreases correlates quite well with the shrinkage of the chaos-2 area and its final\ndisappearance at \u03b2 \u2248 0.9. The line is based on the inference (which seems to correlate\nalso with the evolution of the Poincare\u00b4 section) that the origin of chaos-2 lies in a strong\ninteraction between the smaller-amplitude period-2 oscillation (the smaller-action 2nd-\norder resonance) and the smaller-amplitude period-1 oscillation, which may be roughly\ndescribed as a linear response:\nqLR \u2248 h\n\u03c920 \u2212 \u03c92f\ncos(\u03c9f t), \u03c9f \u2212 \u03c90 \u001d \u0393, \u03c9(I = h\n2\u03c90\n(\u03c920 \u2212 \u03c92f )2\n)\u2212 \u03c90. (4.4.1)\nThe line 4-7, bounding chaos-2 from the left, is just the ZDNR\/NR line: in the region\nto the right of it, the larger-action 2nd-order resonance does not prevent an interaction\nbetween the smaller-action 2nd-order resonance and linear response. The lines 6-7 and 4-5\nbound (from below, and from above, respectively) the region where both linear response\nand the smaller-action 2nd-order resonance are to occur in approximately one and the\nsame energy range: 6-7 and 4-5 correspond to equality of the energy of the attractor of\nthe 2nd-order resonance with the largest and smallest energies respectively of the linear\nresponse. The line 5-6, roughly bounding chaos-2 from the right, is just the line \u03c9f = 2\u03c90:\nnearly everywhere to the right of it, the smaller-action 2nd-order resonance is suppressed\nby linear response so that, if our inference about the origin of chaos-2 is true, chaos should\nnot arise in this region.\nIt should be noted that we have also studied [74] the case when the damping is larger,\n\u0393 = 0.08, and the chaotic areas still match very well the areas delineated by lines derived\nas described above.\n4.4.3 The case of very small damping\nThe results of [73,74] described in the previous sub-section allowed us to infer that we\nhad found a powerful empirical criterion valid in the asymptotic limit \u0393 \u2192 0. To test\nthis, we have been considering [74] the same system as in [73], but with an even smaller\ndamping parameter: \u0393 = 0.01. The results have turned out to be rather disappointing.\nFig. 41 shows a diagram similar to Fig. 38 but for \u0393 = 0.01. The lines calculated by\nour empirical criterion are almost unshifted, naturally. But the real chaotic areas have\nsignificantly shrunk: the upper boundary has shifted almost to the lower boundary, both\nfor chaos-1 and chaos-2. Moreover, for chaos-2, the upper boundary becomes of the crisis\ntype rather than a reverse period-doubling sequence as it was in the case of \u0393 = 0.05.\nThus, we may draw two major conclusions from the results [73,74]. On one hand, the\nfact that the lower, left and right boundaries of chaos-1 and chaos-2 correlate well with\nthe empirical criteria, both for \u0393 = 0.05, 0.08 and \u0393 = 0.01, confirms the validity of the\ninference about the origins of chaos in the relevant regions of the h \u2212 \u03c9f plane. On the\nother hand, an understanding of why and how chaotic attractors evolve as h grows, and\nof how they could be delineated by means of a simple criterion (if any) is absent so far.\nIt will be necessary to study in more detail the evolution of chaotic attractors as \u0393, h\nand \u03c9f vary (in the underdamped range and in the relevant range of the h \u2212 \u03c9f plane,\n59\nrespectively) and to try to understand the underlying reasons for the observed behaviour.\n4.5 Unsolved problems\nItem 1-3 below summarize three major unsolved problems related to periodically driven\nZD systems considered in detail above; items 4-6 introduce issues not so far discussed.\n1. Although the major features of the slow dynamics in the case of an additive periodic\nforce \u2013 at least in systems like the TDO, i.e. in monostable systems whose \u03c9(E) possesses\na local minimum \u2013 have already been understood and described, there are still some\ninteresting problems: (i) to study some of the global bifurcations in more detail (e.g.\nthe yellow line in Fig. 24(b)); (ii) to study in more detail the higher-order resonances,\nfollowing the initial study carried out in [72,73] which demonstrated the existence of\ncertain differences from the case of the 1st-order resonance; (iii) to study characteristic\nfeatures of the bifurcation diagram for the slow dynamics in periodically-driven ZD\nsystems with local maxima in \u03c9(E) and, especially, in those ZD systems which possess\nseparatrices e.g. SQUIDs; (iv) to consider more complicated types of friction and its\ninfluence on the slow dynamics.\n2. As for chaos in the non-dissipative case, it would be interesting to study, both numeri-\ncally and analytically (if possible), the chaotic layer associated with ZDNR, including\nthe structure of the layer, chaotic transport within it, statistics of the Poincare\u00b4 returns,\nlong flights, traps, etc. (cf. [90]; for a numerical study of the statistics of Poincare\u00b4 re-\nturns in the chaotic layer of conventional NR and its qualitative analysis see [91] as well\nas [92] and references therein).\nIt would also be desirable to develop a more accurate numerical description of the\nspikes in the dependence hgc(\u03c9f ) using resonance approximations of different order. A\ndevelopment of an explicit resonant approximation theory for analogous spikes in the\ncase of parametric perturbation is another important and challenging problem (see also\nitem 6 below).\n3. Studies of chaos in weakly dissipative ZD systems are actively developing. The nearest\nempirical task is to find for the same potential as in [73] the value of \u0393 at which\nthe chaotic areas in the h \u2212 \u03c9f plane start to shrink significantly, while the major\nfundamental problem is to understand the underlying reasons for the evolution of the\nrelevant chaotic attractors as the damping parameter decreases. This would hopefully\nallow us to derive, more efficiently than at present, simple criteria for delineation of\nthe corresponding chaotic regions in the parameter space. A further stage would be to\ntest the criteria over a wide range of weakly dissipative systems, also including non-ZD\nsystems.\n4. It would be interesting to study the problem of synchronization in arrays of ZD systems,\ne.g. underdamped SQUIDs. A similar problem in overdamped SQUIDs was studied\nintensively a few years ago (e.g. [86\u201389]) but synchronization between underdamped\nSQUIDs in the ZD regime may be much more pronounced.\n5. Resonance at subharmonics and\/or subharmonic absorption may occur because the\nnon-resonant response at the driving frequency (subharmonic) possesses harmonics at\nmultiple frequencies, due to the nonlinearity. These, in turn, may resonate with one\nor more of the eigenfrequencies (cf. [1]). Such a mechanism in ZD systems is likely to\n60\nbe much more pronounced than in the conventional case, provided that the driving\nfrequency is close to a subharmonic of the extremal eigenfrequency.\n6. Parametric resonance, where the periodic driving affects one or more of the parameters\nof the non-driven system (i.e. as a multiplicative rather than additive perturbation),\nhas not yet been investigated in any detail for ZD systems, although there have been\nsome numerical studies in the context of chaos in certain non-dissipative ZD systems\n[20,21,76]. The significant difference between conventional parametric and nonlinear\n(i.e. additive) resonances suggests that much the same distinction will relate to the ZD\ncase too.\n4.6 Conclusions\nZD systems under periodic driving may manifest very characteristic properties both in\ntheir non-chaotic and chaotic dynamics.\nThus, if the driving is weak enough, the motion is non-chaotic. The slow dynamics in\nthe nonlinear resonances arising in ZD systems may be distinctly different from those in\nconventional systems. The topology of the corresponding nonlinear resonance, referred to\nas ZDNR, is different from that for conventional nonlinear resonance (NR). The variation\nof energy is typically larger than in the conventional NR whereas the variation of angle, on\nthe contrary, is smaller. As the driving amplitude and frequency vary, the slow dynamics\nin periodically driven ZD systems undergo a variety of local and global bifurcations most\nof which do not have analogues in conventional systems. The most important global\nbifurcation is the so-called ZDNR\/NR transition, which may be also interpreted as an\noverlap between nonlinear resonances of the same order. The most important unsolved\nproblem concerning the slow dynamics in periodically driven ZD systems is the analysis\nof the corresponding bifurcation diagramme for the case when the non-driven ZD system\npossesses separatrices.\nChaotic layers associated with ZDNRs in the non-dissipative case also exhibit many dif-\nferences from the layers associated with NRs. They are strongly inhomogeneous, different\nparts being described by different maps. Their dependences on driving amplitude and fre-\nquency also differ from those in the conventional case. A detailed study of chaotic layers\nin ZDNR has yet to be undertaken.\nIn case of the non-dissipative systems with more than one separatrix, the amplitude of\nperiodic driving sufficient for the chaotic transport to connect the separatrices becomes\nvery small if the drving frequency lies close to the extremal eigenfrequency or\/and its\nharmonics.\nIn the presence of weak dissipation, chaos may arise in periodically driven ZD systems\nat unusually small driving amplitudes, because the overlap of different-order resonances\nrequires smaller amplitudes than conventionally. An attempt was made to construct a set\nof rather simple empirical criteria, based on the resonance and linear response approxima-\ntions, aiming to delineate the chaotic regions in the plane of the driving force parameters.\nThese criteria require further study and clarification.\n61\n5 Zero-dispersion systems subject to periodic driving and noise\nThe interplay between noise and periodic driving in dynamical systems is a very broad\nsubject that has been studied in numerous papers and books (see e.g. [2\u20134,38,?,84,93\u201395]\nand references therein). There may be three distinctly different cases \u2013\n(a) Strong or moderate periodic driving, so that chaotic or quasi-chaotic attractors may\narise [60], i.e. the phase space of the noise-free system differs markedly from that in the\nabsence of the driving. In this case, the motion occurs over a broad range of energies\nso that the peculiarity of the extremal (\u201czero-dispersion\u201d) energy is largely lost, which\nis why we do not consider this case here 40 .\n(b) Weak periodic driving with relatively large noise intensity, so that the statistical distri-\nbution differs only slightly from that found in equilibrium without driving. Phenomena\npeculiar to ZD systems under these conditions are discussed in sub-sections 5.1-5.2.\n(c) Moderately weak driving with relatively weak noise. In this case, the distribution in the\nregions of resonant energies differs strongly from equilibrium. Given that the widths of\nthese resonant regions are typically much larger in ZD systems than in conventional\nones, noisy phenomena in periodically driven ZD systems become especially pronounced\nand phenomena peculiar to ZD systems may then arise. Phenomena corresponding to\nthis type of interplay between noise and periodic driving are described in sub-sections\n5.3-5.5.\n5.1 Weak periodic driving: zero-dispersion stochastic resonance\nStochastic resonance (SR) has been the subject of intensive investigation over the last\ndecade: for recent reviews see [93,94]. The idea of SR was originally introduced [98] in\nrelation to a noise-induced enhancement of the amplitude of a low frequency periodic\nsignal in a bistable system. It was subsequently realised [99,100], however, that a stronger\ndefinition of SR in the same system was also possible: it was shown that, for small enough\nsignals, not only the signal amplitude but also the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) could in-\ncrease with noise intensity (temperature) within a certain range. It is this latter definition\nof SR that is probably now the more widely used and accepted, and which we will apply\nbelow.\nA general theory of SR, not confined to the conventional bistable case [100] was introduced\nin [101,102]. It was predicted [103,58] on this basis that SR could also occur in monostable\nsystems. In this perception of the phenomenon, SR is to be anticipated in any system\nwhose fluctuation spectrum in the absence of a periodic signal displays at least one narrow\npeak that grows quickly enough with increasing noise intensity. In the particular case\nconsidered in [103,58], the SR was associated with zero-dispersion peaks (see Sec. 3):\n40 The only ZD consequence is an indirect one: the onset of chaos may in some cases occur at\ndriving force amplitudes much smaller than those typical of conventional systems (see section 4\nabove). Noise-induced escape from the chaotic attractor in one such system (TDO) was recently\nstudied by means of simulations [96,97].\n62\nto distinguish it from conventional bistable SR, it was named zero-dispersion stochastic\nresonance (ZDSR).\nThe original works [103,58] that identified ZDSR theoretically did so on the basis of\nthe TDO model; but it has turned out that this is not actually the best system for\nobservation of ZDSR. This is because adequate resolution between the ZDP and the\npeak coming from low energies requires extremely small values of the damping parameter\n(cf. sub-section 3.6 and Figs. 14-16). Hence only signal growth with noise was observed\nin the analogue experiments [58]. The observation of noise-induced growth of the SNR,\nwhich came later [56], was based on a SQUID model in which the resolution between the\nZDP and the low-energy peak is excellent (Fig. 17). A detailed theoretical description\nof ZDSR, including both its asymptotic theory and the necessary numerical algorithm,\ntogether with detailed analogue experiments for the SQUID model, were presented in\n[47]. It has become apparent since the latter work that ZDSR can in principle be used\nto enhance the output SNR of a SQUID at moderate and high frequencies, in very much\nthe same way as conventional SR has already been used to enhance the output SNR of\nmultistable SQUIDs [104] in the low frequency range.\nWe present the general theory of ZDSR in sub-section 5.1.1. The corresponding analogue\nexperiments are discussed in sub-section 5.1.2.\n5.1.1 General theory\nLet us consider a one-dimensional oscillator subject to a weak periodic force, and to\nfriction and noise which, for the sake of convenience, we take to be linear and white\nrespectively,\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 +\ndU\ndq\n= f(t) + A cos(\u2126t)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032), (5.1.1)\nwhere U(q) is a potential. The noise intensity T corresponds to temperature in cases\nwhere the noise is of thermal origin. We introduce the SNR [100] in terms of the power\nspectrum,\nQ(\u03c9) = lim\n\u03c4\u2192\u221e (4pi\u03c4)\n\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4\u222b\n\u2212\u03c4\ndt q(t) exp(i\u03c9t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n. (5.1.2)\nQ(\u03c9) consists of \u03b4-spikes at the frequency \u2126 of the periodic force, and its harmonics,\nsuperimposed on a smooth fluctuational background that corresponds to the power spec-\ntrum Qq(\u03c9) in the absence of the periodic force, defined in Eq. (3.1.5). The SNR is then\ndefined as the ratio of the intensity (the square) of the \u03b4-spike at \u2126 to the fluctuational\n63\nbackground at \u2126 [100],\nSNR =\nI\u03b4(\u2126)\nQq(\u2126)\n. (5.1.3)\nAs shown in [101,102] (see [93] for further details), the SNR can be written in terms of a\ncomplex susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126) which, in turn, can be expressed in terms of Qq(\u2126) using the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem and the Kramers-Kro\u00a8nig relations [13]\nSNR =\n1\n4\nA2 | \u03c7(\u2126) |2 \/Qq(\u2126),\nRe [\u03c7(\u2126)] =\n2\nT\nP\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nd\u03b1\n(\n\u03b12\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u21262\n)\nQq(\u03b1), (5.1.4)\nIm [\u03c7(\u2126)] =\npi\u2126\nT\nQq(\u2126),\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal part.\nIt was shown [101,102] within this framework that SR in the conventional bistable system\n[99,100] is due to the high, narrow peak in Qq(\u2126) centred at \u2126 = 0 [3,29], which in turn\nis attributable to noise-induced inter-well transitions.\nThis picture, based on (5.1.4), led immediately to a more general perception of SR: intu-\nitively, it must be anticipated in any system whose fluctuation spectrum in the absence of\nperiodic driving exhibits sharp peaks that rise swiftly enough with increasing noise inten-\nsity [105]. McClintock therefore suggested in 1991 that SR-like behaviour might be sought\nin ZD systems, despite their lack of bistability, provided \u2126 lay close to the frequency of the\nZDP. It was quickly confirmed in simulations [58] that, at least on the weaker definition\nof SR (i.e. occurrence of a noise-induced increase of signal only) SR occurs in the TDO.\nIt was then realised that SR-like phenomena might occur in an even broader range of sys-\ntems, in particular in any underdamped nonlinear oscillator: as T increases, the average\nfrequency of oscillations changes and, if it moves closer to the driving frequency \u2126, then\nthe amplitude of the response obviously grows. In ZD systems, this growth is especially\npronounced provided the driving frequency is close enough to the extremal eigenfrequency\n[58]. But an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio was not observed in [58]. This was ex-\nplained in [103], which derived theoretically the conditions for which an SNR increase\nwould be observed in the ZD system (the TDO) used in [58]. In addition, [103] analysed\nrigorously the earlier intuitive inference [58,105] about the range of occurrence of SR 41 .\nWe follow [103] in the few next paragraphs.\nLet us suppose that Qq(\u03c9) has a high, narrow peak at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9m, i.e. that we can present\nthe spectrum as a sum of the two following terms:\nQq(\u03c9) = Qpeak(\u03c9) +Qfar(\u03c9), (5.1.5)\n41 Note that, chronologically, [103] was published before either [58] or [105]. In fact, however,\nthe central ideas of [58] had been reported earlier at the 1992 SR conference in San-Diego [105].\n64\nwhere Qpeak(\u03c9) has a maximum of magnitude Qm at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9m and width \u2206\u03c9 \u001c \u03c9m, while\nQfar(\u03c9) is negligible at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9m though it may still be substantial at frequencies far from\n\u03c9m in comparison to \u2206\u03c9. If the signal frequency \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m, then absolute values of the\ncontributions to Re [\u03c7(\u2126)], i.e. to the integral in (5.1.4), from frequencies close to \u03c9m (i.e.\nfor |\u03b1\u2212 \u03c9m| \u223c< \u2206\u03c9) and from those far from it are respectively\nFclose \u223c 1\nT\n\u03c9m | dQq(\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9m)\nd\u03c9\n| \u2206\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9mQm\nT\n, (5.1.6)\nFfar \u223c 1\nT\n\u03c92f\n|\u03c92f \u2212 \u03c92m|\nSf , (5.1.7)\nwhere Sf =\n\u222b\nd\u03c9Qfar(\u03c9) is the area under Qfar(\u03c9), and \u03c9f lies within the range of the\nmaximum of Qfar(\u03c9). If Qfar(\u03c9) possesses more than one distinct maximum, then Ffar\nshould be a sum of analogous terms for each maximum.\nIt can be seen from (5.1.6) that the order of magnitude of the contribution to the real part\nof the susceptibility from frequencies close to \u03c9m does not depend on the width \u2206\u03c9 of the\npeak Qpeak while, if the maximum Qm of this peak is high enough, then this contribution\ndominates over Ffar (5.1.7). Correspondingly, given the last equality in (5.1.4), i.e. that\nIm [\u03c7(\u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m)] \u223c Qm\u03c9m\/T , the absolute magnitude of the susceptibility at \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m is\ngiven by\n|\u03c7(\u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m)| =\n\u221a\n(Re [\u03c7(\u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m)])2 + (Im [\u03c7(\u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m)])2 \u223c Qm\u03c9m\nT\n. (5.1.8)\nThus, if Qm increases faster than T , then the response of the system to a weak periodic\nforce of frequency close to \u03c9m will also increase with T . Moreover, if this increase of Qm\nis faster than T 2, then the SNR increases too, as must follow from Eqs. (5.1.4),(5.1.8).\nZero-dispersion peaks ideally fit the framework described above, and the correspond-\ning SR-like phenomenon (which was historically the first among high-frequency SR-\nphenomena: cf. e.g. [106]) was called zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (ZDSR) [103].\nObviously, the smaller the damping parameter \u0393 is, the higher and narrower the ZDP\nis and, therefore, the more pronounced the ZDSR becomes. Moreover, the SNR can be\ndescribed in the asymptotic limit \u0393\u2192 0 by a universal function, which is not difficult to\nderive by substitution of Qq(\u2126) (3.3.19) into (5.1.4) (cf.

These\nconditions are always satisfied in the asympototic limit of small \u0393 when \u2126 is close enough\nto n\u2126m.\nThe function R(x), plotted in Fig. 42 characterises the frequency dependence of the SNR.\nIt decreases monotonically with x (cf. the harmonic oscillator for which SNR \u221d \u2126\u22122), but\nthe form of the decrease changes with x: it can be shown that the SNR \u221d (\u2212x)3\/2 for\nlarge negative x, and that the SNR \u221d x\u22121\/2 for large positive x.\nOf greater interest in the present context is that the SNR is proportional to Cscale, which\nincreases sharply with T for T \u001c Em. Consequently, the SNR must increase with T within\nsome range 42 , just as in the case of SR in conventional bistable systems [93,94,99\u2013102].\nThe activation-law type dependence of the SNR on T arises because both the susceptibility\nand fluctuation spectrum are determined by those oscillator vibrations whose energies lie\nwithin a narrow band around the extremal frequency, whose population increases rapidly\nwith T .\nThe frequency dependence of the SNR is well-described by the universal function R, but\nonly for very small values of \u0393 and in the close vicinity of n\u2126m; the same restrictions apply\nalso to the shape of the ZDP itself (see Sec. 3). In order to calculate the SNR over a wider\nrange of parameters, it is necessary to compute the fluctuation spectrum numerically. The\nalgorithm [11,47] has been described by us in sub-section 3.5 above and the results for\nthe SNR based on it are discussed below in sub-section 5.1.2.\n5.1.2 Applications to the TDO and SQUID models and analogue electronic experiments\nIn [103], the numerical algorithm [11] (see also sub-section 3.5) was applied to the calcu-\nlation of the spectrum Qq(\u2126), which could then be substituted into Eq. (5.1.4) to find the\nSNR. As expected, there was a range within which the SNR increased with T provided\nthat \u0393 was small enough and \u2126 was close enough to \u2126m. At the same time, because the\nminimal eigenfrequency, \u2126m, and the eigenfrequency in the bottom of the well, \u21260, are\ntypically very close to each other in the TDO model, separation of the ZDP from the\nlow-energy peak requires very small values of \u0393: for the parameters of the model [58],\nit needed to be\n\u223c\n< 10\u22123 [103]. That is why, the noise-induced growth of SNR was not\nachieved in [58], in which the analogue circuit had \u0393 \u223c 10\u22122.\n42 Strictly, R([\u2126 \u2212 n\u2126m]\/\u2206\u2126\u02dcn) also depends on T because \u2206\u2126\u02dcn \u221d T 1\/2. This dependence is\nmuch weaker, however, than the activation-law type dependence of Cscale on T , and therefore\nhas only a minor influence.\n66\nAt the same time, the response (\u221d |\u03c7|) did grow dramatically with T [58]. Of course,\nthis phenomenon is not restricted to ZD systems (though it is more pronounced in ZD\nsystems than in conventional ones: cf. [58]). The mechanism of such growth is related to\nthe tuning (by means of noise) of the statistically averaged eigenfrequency \u03c9(\u3008E\u3009) to the\nfrequency of the driving force (provided \u2126 lies within the spectrum of eigenfrequencies).\nRecently, this idea was also applied to the conventional bistable oscillator [107].\nA much more pronounced manifestation of ZDSR occurs in the SQUID model [56,57,47]\n(Fig. 43). The frequency dependence of the SNR in ZD oscillators quite generally displays\na resonant-like behaviour (Fig. 44), in contrast to the behaviour of the SNR in conven-\ntional systems (cf. [99\u2013102]). At the same time, the width of each resonance is generally\nmuch larger than the band of frequencies within which conventional SR is manifested in\noverdamped SQUIDs. This is especially clear from Fig. 45, in which one can see that the\nnoise-induced growth of SNR may occur in a rather broad range of frequencies. Moreover,\nthere is typically more than one maximum in the frequency dependence: this is due to\nthe multiple extrema in \u03c9(E) (see Fig. 4). In the case of many wells in the SQUID po-\ntential (2.1.5) (B \u001c 1), the extremal eigenfrequencies are very close to each other and,\nin addition, the energy ranges responsible for the \u201cadjacent\u201d ZDPs become very narrow\nand close to each other. Consequently, the noise-induced growth of SNR smears or even\ndisappears altogether. In the opposite limit, B \u001d 1, the extrema of \u03c9(E) are very shallow:\nthe system reduces to the harmonic oscillator, where growth of the SNR with temperature\nis absent [93]. Thus, the optimal range for ZDSR in SQUIDs is B \u223c 1 43 . Thus, together\nwith the condition of being underdamped \u0393\u001c \u2126m \u223c\n\u221a\nB, the optimal conditions for the\nmanifestation of ZDSR in SQUIDs are\n\u0393\u001c B1\/2 \u223c 1, (5.1.11)\nor, in terms of SQUID parameters (see sub-section 2.1),\nRN\u001d (L\/C)1\/2,\n(5.1.12)\n\u03b2 \u223c 1.\nFor a more detailed discussion of ZDSR in SQUIDs, see [47].\n5.1.3 Unsolved problems\n(1) The theory of ZDSR for a single oscillator has been quite well elaborated and tested in\nanalogue and computer experiments in many details, especially for the SQUID model.\nThus, the most important problem for the future is, in our opinion, a realization of\nZDSR in real systems and its uses in various applications.\n43 It does not matter whether B is above or below the critical value Bc \u223c 1 dividing the boundary\nbetween multi-stability (B < Bc) and monostability (B > Bc) of the SQUID.\n67\nThe most probable candidate for such a realization is a SQUID loop. The major\ndifficulty which may occur at this is that, typically [47], the relevant extremal eigen-\nfrequency \u03c9m is of the order of a plasma frequency of the Josephson junction, which\nis very high (of the order of 1-10 GHz [15]). This difficulty could be removed in two\nways. One of them is to make the extremal eigenfrequency significantly smaller by\nmeans of a proper choice of the loop and junction parameters (note however that the\nZDSR becomes less pronounced if one uses the extremum of \u03c9(E) with too small\nextremal eigenfrequency [108]; a maximal decrease at which the ZDSR is still pro-\nnounced is of the order of 10 typically [108]). Another way is [109] to increase the\nfrequency of the relevant (low-frequency) signal to the range of a (high) plasma fre-\nquency, to enhance it by means of the ZDSR and then to decrease the frequency back\nto the low-frequency range, in analogy with conventional radio technique [110].\n(2) Another interesting problem for the future is to study ZDSR in arrays of ZD oscilla-\ntors. Conventional SR in an array of overdamped bistable systems was shown [111]\nto be enhanced in comparison with the single system. It was recently shown [112,113]\nthat, in an array of conventional (non-ZD) monostable underdamped oscillators, the\nsignal may be enhanced by the application of noise, similarly to the case of the single\noscillator [58] but in a more pronounced way. In addition, the dependence of such an\nenhancement on noise intensity exhibits more than one peak, unlike the case of the\nsingle oscillator [58]. This is because the degeneracy of the eigenfrequency in a sys-\ntem of identical non-interacting oscillators is lifted if a coupling is introduced. These\nconsiderations have allowed us to suggest [47,114] studies of arrays of ZD oscillators.\nUnlike the case of conventional oscillators, they should exhibit a very pronounced\nincrease of SNR, rather than just of the signal, and the signal enhancement should\nbe much stronger than for the case of conventional oscillators. On the other hand,\ncompared to single ZD oscillators, arrays promise to provide much stronger mani-\nfestations of ZDSR, and the dependence of the SNR on noise intensity promises to\npossess several peaks, unlike the single one in the case of a single oscillator.\n5.2 Weak periodic driving: subharmonic absorption\nThe resonant response of a nonlinear oscillator to periodic driving at a subharmonic\nfrequency, and the related resonant subharmonic absorption, are well known phenomena\n[1] that are relevant to many areas of physics, for example mechanics [1] and nonlinear\noptics [115]. The theory of these phenomena in a weakly nonlinear noise-free oscillator is\nquite well established 44 . Their mechanism is as follows: the sub-harmonic driving (e.g.\nat 1\/2 of the frequency \u03c90 of a small-amplitude eigenoscillation of the oscillator) causes\na non-resonant, approximately linear, response. Due to the nonlinearity, this response\nalso possesses higher harmonics; one of these harmonics \u2013 the 2nd one, in the case of the\ndriving at the frequency \u03c90\/2 \u2013 turns out to be resonant to the eigenoscillation, so that\nthis harmonic provides for resonant absorption if there is friction in the system. Such\nresonant nonlinear absorption may turn out to be stronger than the linear non-resonant\nabsorption, provided that the driving amplitude is not too small.\n44 We note however that, as mentioned in sub-section 4.5, the case of ZD systems was not studied\nand it would be interesting to study it.\n68\nHowever the frequency ranges where such phenomena may occur are typically limited to\nthe close vicinity of the subharmonics of \u03c90. The situation changes drastically if noise\nis added [116]: it populates a relatively broad range of energies, thereby significantly\nwidening the range of eigenfrequencies that are relevant (typically, \u03b4\u03c9 \u223c |\u03c9(0) \u2212 \u03c9(T )|,\nwhere \u03c9(0) \u2261 \u03c90 and T is temperature). If the noise is too large, on the other hand,\nso that the relevant range of eigenfrequencies becomes too broad, then the resonance is\nsmeared out. Thus, for a given driving frequency that is distinctly inside the spectrum of\neigenfrequencies, there is typically a distinct peak in the resonant nonlinear absorption\nand higher-harmonic generation as functions of temperature. In a sense, this may be\nconsidered as a kind of stochastic resonance (cf. sub-section 5.1), but for a nonlinear\nrather than linear response, and at the subharmonic rather than at the main\/multiple\nfrequency.\nIn a conventional (non-ZD) system, such peaks in the dependences on temperature of the\nabsorption and of the 2nd-harmonic intensity do not depend on the damping parameter \u0393,\nprovided that \u0393 is small (i.e. \u0393\u001c \u03c90, \u03b4\u03c9) [116]. In contrast, in ZD systems, if the driving\nfrequency is close to a subharmonic of the extreme eigenfrequency \u03c9m, the magnitudes\nof the peaks should become extremely high as \u0393 \u2192 0 (infinitely high if the frequency is\nexactly equal to the subharmonic of \u03c9m), closely analogous to zero-dispersion peaks in\nthe linear response at the main\/multiple frequency (see Sec. 3).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only paper on resonant nonlinear absorption in the\npresence of noise is [116]. It concentrates mostly on the conventional case i.e. where the\nZD property is not relevant. At the same time, the authors of [116] did notice some inter-\nesting features that may arise in the case of a ZD system: they presented some illustrative\nexamples, though for a particular model (the TDO) which, as already mentioned, is far\nfrom being the best choice for demonstration of the relevant ZD phenomena. Thus, it\nwould be both interesting and important to study resonant nonlinear absorption experi-\nmentally in other ZD models, e.g. in the SQUID model, and to develop the corresponding\ngeneral theory \u2013 which is, however, far from being a trivial problem.\nBelow, following [116], we present in sub-section 5.2.1 the theory of 2nd harmonic gen-\neration and of subharmonic absorption for the TDO model where the extreme frequency\n\u03c9m \u2261 \u03c9(Em) is close to \u03c90, so that the nonlinearity of the eigenoscillation in the relevant\nrange of energies E\n\u223c\n< Em is weak. Subsection 5.2.2 presents some experimental results. In\nsub-section 5.2.3, we present a brief discussion of the results and identify some remaining\nunsolved problems.\n5.2.1 Theory\nThe non-driven oscillator that we consider is the TDO (4.2.1) (see also Sec. 2.3) with\n\u03c90 = \u03b3 = 1, \u03b2 = 5\/3; the eigenfrequency \u03c9 as a function of action is shown in Fig. 22. As\ncan be seen from the figure, the minimal eigenfrequency \u03c9m \u2248 0.805 i.e. only slightly less\nthan \u03c90. The corresponding energy Em \u2248 0.1635 is also rather small so that, in the range\nof relevant energies E\n\u223c\n< Em, the anharmonic corrections in the potential U(q) (i.e. \u03b2q\n3\/3\n69\nand \u03b3q4\/4) are small in comparison with the parabolic term \u03c920q\n2\/2:\nEm \u001c \u03c9\n4\n0\n\u03b3\n,\n\u03c960\n\u03b22\n. (5.2.1)\nThis allows us to use in the theory below the harmonic approximation as the lowest-order\napproximation.\nThe equation of motion which we study is formally similar to that considered earlier in\nthe context of stochastic resonance (cf. (5.1.1)),\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 + \u03c920q + \u03b2q\n2 + \u03b3q3 = f(t) + A cos(\u2126t), (5.2.2)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032),\n\u0393\u001c \u03c9(E),\u2126,\nbut the relevant range of frequencies \u2126 is different: we assume that the doubled frequency\nof the driving force, 2\u2126, is close to the band of thermally excited vibrations of the oscillator,\n|2\u2126\u2212 \u03c9(E)| \u001c \u03c9(E) for E \u223c< T, (5.2.3)\nwhile\nT\n\u223c\n< Em \u001c \u03c9\n4\n0\n\u03b3\n,\n\u03c960\n\u03b22\n. (5.2.4)\nThe quantity of major interest in the present context also differs from that in stochastic\nresonance problems, namely it is the absorption coefficient:\n\u03ba = A\u22122\u3008q\u02d9(t)A cos(\u2126t)\u3009 (5.2.5)\nwhere the overbar denotes averaging over the period 2pi\/\u2126.\nFor small amplitudes of the driving force and for moderately weak noise intensities (5.2.4),\nthe analysis of the resonant nonlinear response of the oscillator may be done in two steps\nfamiliar from [1]: (i) one first ignores the oscillator nonlinearity, so that a sinusoidal ex-\nternal force results in nonresonant vibrations at the force frequency \u2126 (the perturbation\nparameter is the force amplitude A weighted by nonlinearity constants); and (ii) in the\nnext iteration one substitutes the corresponding oscillating term in the oscillator coordi-\nnate into the nonlinear terms in the restoring force on the oscillator. These terms then\noscillate at the overtones of \u2126, and act as an effective force that drives the oscillator. The\nresonant linear response to this force may then be analysed.\n70\nThus, to lowest order in A, nonresonant forced vibrations may be described in the har-\nmonic approximation,\nq(1)(t) \u2248 A\n\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262\ncos(\u2126t+ \u03c6(1)), \u03c6(1) \u2248 \u2212 \u0393\u2126\n\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262\n. (5.2.6)\nThe angular shift \u03c6(1) allows for a weak linear absorption by the oscillator. The corre-\nsponding linear nonresonant absorption coefficient is\n\u03ba(1) =\n\u0393\u21262\n2(\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262)2\n. (5.2.7)\nThe equation of motion for the vibrations at frequency 2\u2126 in the range of moderately\nsmall noise intensities (5.2.4) can be obtained by seeking the solution of Eq. (5.2.2) in the\nform q(t) \u2248 q(1)(t) + q(2)(t). The equation of motion for q(2)(t) may be written as\nq\u00a8(2) + \u0393q\u02d9(2) +\u03c920q\n(2) + \u03b2[q(2)]2 + \u03b3[q(2)]3\n\u2248 f(t)\u2212 A\n2\n2(\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262)2\n\u03b2[cos(2\u2126t+ 2\u03c6(1)) + 1]. (5.2.8)\nWe have neglected terms of higher order in A as well as the terms \u03b2Aq(2), \u03b3A[q(2)]2, \u03b3A2q(2).\nIn the range (5.2.4), they contain, in addition to A, a small factor proportional to the\namplitude of fluctuational vibrations. The nonresonant time-independent term on the\nright-hand side of (5.2.8) is retained for the sake of clarity; it gives rise to a shift of the\nequilibrium position of the nonlinear oscillator due to the periodic driving.\nEquation (5.2.8) is the equation of motion for a nearly resonantly driven weakly nonlinear\noscillator. For small A the response of the oscillator to the force \u221d \u03b2A2 can be described\nby linear response theory [13]:\n\u3008q(2)\u3009\u2248\u2212 \u03b2A\n2\n2\u03c920(\u03c9\n2\n0 \u2212 \u21262)2\n\u2212\n\u03b2A2\n4(\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262)2\n[\u03c7(2\u2126)e\u2212i(2\u2126t+2\u03c6\n(1)) + \u03c7\u2217(2\u2126)ei(2\u2126t+2\u03c6\n(1))], (5.2.9)\nwhere \u03c7(2\u2126) is the susceptibility of the system at 2\u2126.\nIn terms of nonlinear optics, the onset of vibrations at twice the frequency of the driving\nforce corresponds to second-harmonic generation (SHG). Equation (5.2.9) fully describes\nresonant SHG in an underdamped fluctuating nonlinear oscillator.\nIn the frequency range (5.2.3) the susceptibility \u03c7(2\u2126) is resonantly large. In the absence\nof noise, \u03c7(2\u2126) \u2248 (4\u21262\u2212\u03c920\u2212i2\u0393\u2126)\u22121. In the presence of noise, \u03c7 is related to the spectrum\n71\nof fluctuations Qq (3.1.5) by means of fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the Kramers-\nKro\u00a8nig relation: see (5.1.4). At T \u001c Em, the spectrum can be evaluated analytically [2,43]\nwhile, in general, it can be readily calculated by means of the numerical algorithm [11]\ndescibed in sub-section 3.5 above. The latter was used in Figs. 46-48.\nFigs. 46 and 47 show the dependence of |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 as a function of T for five values of \u03c9 = 2\u2126,\nand as a function of \u03c9 for three values of T , respectively. Fig. 48 shows the dependence\non T of the real and imaginary parts of \u03c7(\u03c9). It is clear from Figs. 46 and 48 that, for\n\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c90, the functions \u03c7\u2032(\u03c9), \u03c7\u2032\u2032(\u03c9), and |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 display nonmonotonic dependences on\nT . The peaks in |\u03c7\u2032\u2032(\u03c9)| and |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 vs T are due to the fact that the noise \u201ctunes\u201d an\nunderdamped oscillator to a given frequency. As \u03c9 decreases the peaks become lower and\nbroader (see the curves (a)-(d) in Fig. 46): this is due to the fact that, if the frequency\nlies in the the range of a monotonic decrease of \u03c9(E), then the smaller the frequency the\nlarger is the T that is required to tune the oscillator to this frequency, while the larger T\nis the larger the fluctuational smearing \u03b4\u03c9 of the oscillator frequency so that the oscillator\ndisplays a less resonant response. However, as \u03c9 reaches the close vicinity of \u03c9m, the peaks\nagain rise (to infinity if \u0393\u2192 0): see the curve (e) in Fig. 46. The latter effect is due to the\nZD property, which provides an enhancement of the resonant properties of the oscillations\nas T becomes comparable with Em.\nEquation (5.2.9) also makes it possible to analyze resonant absorption at frequency 2\u2126,\ni.e. two-photon absorption (TPA), in the language of nonlinear optics. To do this one\nhas to iterate Eq. (5.2.2) once more and to find the term q(3)(t) (i.e. the term \u221d A3):\nthis term contains components oscillating with frequency \u2126 and thereby contributes to\nthe absorption coefficient \u03ba (5.2.5). The resultant overall expression for \u03ba allows both for\nthe nonresonant linear (in A) absorption due to oscillator damping, and for a resonant\nnonlinear (in A) absorption. It takes the form\n\u03ba \u2248 \u03ba1 + \u03ba2,\n\u03ba2 =\n\u2126\n4(\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262)2\n(\n\u03b2A\n\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262\n)2\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032(2\u2126), (5.2.10)\nwhere \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 are respectively the coefficients of linear and nonlinear absorption. The\ncoefficient \u03ba1 for small noise intensities is given by (5.2.7).\nIt follows from (5.2.10) that, in the range (5.2.4), TPA as a function of frequency and\ntemperature should display behaviour similar to that displayed by linear resonant absorp-\ntion of a nonlinear oscillator at the frequency 2\u2126, which is described by the imaginary\npart 45 of the susceptibility, \u03c7\u2032\u2032(2\u2126). Thus, like \u03c7\u2032\u2032(2\u2126), the TPA has a distinct peak as a\nfunction of T provided 2\u2126 is close to \u03c90; the peak decreases and broadens as \u2126 decreases\nuntil the the close vicinity of \u03c9m\/2 is reached, when it again rises due to the ZD property.\n45 We note that the proportionality factor between \u03ba2 and \u03c7\n\u2032\u2032(2\u2126) is the squared coefficient of\nthe cubic nonlinearity \u03b2, in agreement with the well-known fact that TPA occurs in noncen-\ntrosymmetric systems.\n72\n5.2.2 Experiment\nTo test these theoretical predictions, the authors of [116] performed analogue electronic\nexperiments and digital simulations. We describe them briefly below; further details may\nbe found in [116].\n5.2.2.1 Circuit\nThe analogue model was of a standard design, constructed on the basis of the principles\ndescribed in detail elsewhere [52\u201354], using operational amplifiers, multipliers, and other\nstandard analog components to perform the required mathematical operations of addition,\nsubstraction, multiplication, division, integration, etc. (cf. also sub-section 3.6). After\nproper rescalings, the circuit modeled the parameters of Eq. (5.2.2) in the following way:\n\u03c90 = 1, \u03b2 = 5\/3, \u03b3 = 1. (5.2.11)\nThe nominal value of \u0393 was 0.0142. However, for such small damping, the actual value\nusually differs from the nominal one due to the effects of stray capacitances and resistances\nin the circuit. In the present case, the actual value, measured experimentally by two\nindependent methods (cf. [46]) was found to be \u0393 = 0.0122.\nThe intensity of the second harmonic of the signal was measured directly from the\nensemble-averaged signal in the circuit at frequency 2\u2126. It follows from (5.2.9) that this in-\ntensity divided by \u03b22A4\/(16(\u03c920\u2212\u21262)4) gives us |\u03c7(2\u2126)|2, provided A is small (A = 0.0176\nin the relevant experiment).\nThe two-photon absorption coefficient was determined from measurements of the angular\nshift \u03c6, relative to the driving force, of the ensemble-averaged signal at frequency \u2126. In\nthe range of moderately weak noise intensities (5.2.4) the expression for the angular shift\ncan be obtained in a way similar to that used to derive Eq. (5.2.10) for the absorption\ncoefficient. In the limit of weak absorption the angular shift is given by a sum of the\ncontributions \u03c6(1) and \u03c6(2) that correspond, respectively, to linear absorption and to TPA:\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6(1) + \u03c6(2), \u03c6(2) = \u22121\n2\n\u03b22A2\n(\u03c920 \u2212 \u21262)3\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032(2\u2126), (5.2.12)\nwhere the angular shift \u03c6(1) is given by Eq. (5.2.6) with higher-order corrections in T\n[116].\nThe digital simulation was based on the algorithm described in [117]. The spectra of\nfluctuations in the absence of periodic driving obtained by two alternative algorithms\n[117] and [118] coincided with each other.\n5.2.2.2 Results\nA. Second harmonic generation.\n73\nMeasurements of the intensity of the signal at the second harmonic of the forcing frequency\nare shown for two frequencies by the data points in Figs. 49(a) and 49(b). In the range of\nforce amplitudes A investigated, the intensity of the second-harmonic signal (SHS) was\nproportional to A4, and the data in Fig. 49 have been appropriately scaled for comparison\nwith the relevant theoretical susceptibility curves from Fig. 46. Also included in Fig. 49 are\ntheoretical values of |\u03c7|2 from (5.1.4) derived from fluctuation spectra obtained via digital\nsimulations of the dynamics. It is evident that all the results agree well within experimental\nerror. Direct measurements of the linear response to a weak force at the resonant frequency\n\u2126 \u2248 \u03c90 were also found to be in a good agreement with theory. It is clear that the\ndependence of the SHS intensity on the noise intensity is strongly nonmonotonic, the\npeak of the SHS intensity being particularly tall and narrow for \u2126 \u2248 \u03c90\/2. The noise-\ninduced enhancement, defined as the ratio of the maximal intensity of the signal at a\ngiven frequency to the intensity for T = 0, was found to exceed a factor of 4.5 under the\nexperimental conditions.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 49(b) that, for \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m\/2, there is a distinct peak too. For the\ngiven model and given parameters, it is a bit smaller and broader than the peak in the\ncase \u2126 \u2248 \u03c90\/2 but, if one further decreased \u0393 while shifting \u2126 yet closer to \u03c9m\/2, then the\nmagnitude of the peak would grow (to infinity, in the limits \u0393\u2192 0 and \u2126\u2192 \u03c9m\/2). Note\nalso that the noise-induced enhancement in the case \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m\/2 is incomparably larger\nthan in the case \u2126 \u2248 \u03c90\/2 (cf. Fig. 49).\nB. Nonlinear absorption.\nAs explained above in sub-section 5.2.2.1, a convenient way to investigate the absorption\nof a periodic driving force A cos(\u2126t) in an analog experiment is to determine the angular\nshift between the ensemble-averaged signal at frequency \u2126 and the force itself. It follows\nfrom the theory (see Eqs. (5.2.10) and (5.2.12)) that the absorption coefficient and the\nangular shift are each made up of a sum of two components, representing linear and\nnonlinear contributions. In Figs. 50(a) and 51(a) we compare the measured and calculated\ndependences of the total angular shift \u03c6 on the noise intensity. The theoretical curves (solid\nlines) were calculated using Eq. (5.2.12) with \u03c6(1) given by (5.2.6) with the T -dependent\ncorrections [116] and \u03c6(2) given by (5.2.12) with \u03c7(2\u2126) from (5.1.4). To evaluate the\nspectrum of fluctuations, the algorithm [11] was used.\nAn additional numerical experiment was performed in which the angular lag at the fre-\nquency of the weak periodic force was found directly (see [116] for details) and the\nspectrum of fluctuations in the absence of periodic driving, Qq(\u03c9), was obtained by\nMonte Carlo simulation of the dynamics. The resultant values of Qq(\u03c9) were used to\nevaluate the angular shift according to Eqs. (5.1.4) and (5.2.12), with \u03c6(1) given by\n\u2212 arctan[\u03c7\u2032\u2032(\u2126)\/\u03c7\u2032(\u2126)]. In Figs. 50 and 51 these results are compared with those derived\nfrom theory and from analog experiment. All the results - including those from theory,\ndirect analog simulations, and numerical simulations, both direct and in the absence of\nforce - are in good agreement with each other.\nThe contribution of the linear nonresonant angular shift to the total angular shift is\n74\nimportant when the nonlinear resonant effect is relatively small. It is especially true for\nthe relatively broad peak at \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9m\/2. For this reason, the angular shift was measured for\nvery small force amplitudes when \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6(1). The temperature dependences of the measured\nangular shift \u03c6 and the calculated linear angular shift \u03c6(1) are shown, for two different\nfrequencies, in Figs. 50(b) and 51(b). It can be seen that \u03c6(1), as given by (5.2.6) with\nthe T -dependent corrections, is in reasonable agreement with both the measured \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6(1)\nand with the values of \u03c6(1) = \u2212 arctan[\u03c7\u2032\u2032(\u2126)\/\u03c7\u2032(\u2126)] obtained by computer simulation of\nQq(\u03c9). The results were clearly very different from those of Figs. 50(a) and 51(a).\n5.2.3 Discussion and unsolved problems\nThus, the addition of noise may strongly enhance the generation of harmonics of order\nhigher than 1, as well as the nonlinear absorption at subharmonics of eigenfrequencies\n(the classical analogue of many-photon absorption). It has been demonstrated both the-\noretically and experimentally that the intensity of the second harmonic and two-photon\nabsorption coefficients as functions of temperature (which characterises noise intensity:\nsee (5.2.2)) are strongly peaked, provided that the frequency of the driving force \u2126 is\nclose either to the eigenfrequency of small-amplitude oscillations or to the extremal eigen-\nfrequency (where the dispesion is equal to zero: d\u03c9\/dE = 0). These phenomena may be\nconsidered as a generalization of stochastic resonance (cf. e.g. sub-section 5.1) for the non-\nlinear response. It should be emphasized in connection with this that, if one assumes the\nstrong definition of SR i.e. a noise-induced increase of the signal-to-noise ratio rather than\nsignal only, then such an increase in relation to the nonlinear response to the subharmonic\ndriving may occur only in a ZD system provided also that \u2126 is close to a subharmonic\nof the extreme eigenfrequency (cf. sub-section 5.1 related to the linear response to the\ndriving on the main\/multiple frequency).\nThe quantitative theory presented above is valid only in the range of small T (5.2.4), when\nthe anharmonicity of the vibrations involved is weak. At the same time, it is intuitively\nobvious that the effect of SHG and TPA should still exist for frequencies 2\u2126 significantly\ndifferent from \u03c90 (while still lying within the spectrum of eigenfrequencies) provided T\nis large enough to tune the oscillator to such a frequency. Obviously, the theory would\nthen require generalization to allow for the strong nonlinearity of the oscillations. Such\na generalization for the conventional case of a monotonic \u03c9(E) was developed in [116]:\nit is based on the iterative perturbation scheme applied to the Fokker-Plank equation\ni.e. to the equation of motion of the probability density rather than the coordinate itself.\nHowever this theory is not valid in the ZD case where it gives rise to singularities.\nAs already mentioned, the ZDP and the spectral peak at the main frequency are much\nmore widely separated in a strongly nonlinear oscillator than in the moderately nonlinear\nTDO. The noise-induced increase of SHG, and especially of the corresponding signal-to-\nnoise ratio, and the TPA at subharmonics of the extremal eigenfrequency in the strongly\nnonlinear oscillator (cf. SQUIDs: see sub-section 2.1) may be expected to be much more\npronounced than in the TDO with \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9m \u001c \u03c90, in analogy with the linear response at\nthe main frequency (see sub-section 5.1). It will thus be important to test this inference\nexperimentally and to develop the corresponding theory.\n75\n5.3 Weak noise: escape rates and directed diffusion\nIn the previous subsections (5.1 and 5.2), we discussed the interplay between noise and\nperiodic driving mainly in the context of spectral densities, signal-to-noise ratio, and noise-\ninduced absorption. In doing so, we assumed the periodic driving to be much weaker than\nthe noise, in the sense that the distortion of thermal equilibrium by the periodic driving\nwas taken as negligible.\nIn contrast, in the three sub-sections that follow, the noise is assumed to be weaker than\nthe periodic driving, in the sense that the equilibrium\/quasiequilibrium is significantly\ndistorted by the driving force, at least within the relevant ranges of phase space.\nFurthermore, the present sub-section relates to quantities that differ from those discussed\nin sub-sections 5.1, 5.2: the major quantities of interest here are the escape rate from a\npotential well, and the noise-induced net flux in periodically-driven periodic potentials\n(ratchets).\nIn sub-section 5.3.1 below, we describe briefly the results of [95] on the influence of non-\nadiabatic periodic driving on the noise-induced escape rate, and we consider the asso-\nciated ratchet effect in periodic potentials. In sub-section 5.3.2, the underdamped limit\nis considered, based on the results of [84,119]. In sub-section 5.3.3, we discuss particular\nfeatures of the effects in zero-dispersion systems [119]. Finally, in sub-section 5.3.4, we\ndraw conclusions and identify major unsolved problems.\n5.3.1 Escape rates and resonant directed diffusion in nonadiabatically driven systems at\nmoderately weak damping\nThe influence of a weak nonadiabatic periodic driving force on noise-induced escape is a\nfundamental problem whose solution is far from complete, despite numerous studies (see\ne.g. [120\u2013125,95,126,84,119] and references therein). It is also relevant to many applica-\ntions, e.g. to the destruction of metastable states in devices based on Josephson junctions\n[120,125] or in mechanical electrometers [127], and to directed diffusion [95,126].\nUnlike most of the work on stochastic resonance (see e.g. [99\u2013102]) and early works on\ndirected diffusion (e.g. [128]), which relate to adiabatic driving where the escape rates\nare determined by the instantaneous value of the driving force, the escape rate for nona-\ndiabatic driving does not manage to follow changes of the driving force. If the driving\nforce is very small, its main effect on the escape was shown [122\u2013124] to be an enhance-\nment of the diffusion over energy, which increases only the prefactor in the escape rate\nand does so relatively weakly: the correction is quadratic in the driving amplitude. But\nif the amplitude of non-adiabatic driving exceeds the properly weighted temperature, its\neffect was recently shown [95] to be much stronger: the corresponding mechanism relies\non positive work by the force in pushing the system resonantly with the eigenoscillation\nat the resonant energy, thus freeing the noise from some of this work within the range\nof energies close to the resonant one, and thereby reducing the activation energy. More-\nover, in a periodic potential, the driving-induced correction to the activation energy for\n76\nescape over the left barrier may differ from that over the right barrier, provided that a\ncertain space-time symmetry [95,131] is broken, e.g. the potential is asymmetric within\none period. This difference of activation energies leads to a net flux that strongly (in an\nactivation-like way) depends on temperature. Here we consider briefly the driving-induced\nreduction of the activation energy and the associated noise-induced directed diffusion in\nperiodic potentials (\u201cratchets\u201d), following majorly [95].\nA. Escape rate\nConsider first the escape rate from a potential well. As a simple example of a system\npossessing a barrier, we shall use the double-well Duffing oscillator (Fig. 52). The external\nperiodic force is assumed sinusoidal, for the sake of simplicity. Thus, the equation of motion\nis 46\n\u03a0(q\u00a8, q\u02d9, q, t) = \u03be(t), \u03a0 = q\u00a8 + 2\u0393q\u02d9 + U \u2032(q)\u2212 A cos(\u2126t), (5.3.1)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 = 4\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032), U(q) = \u2212q2\/2 + q4\/4, T \u001c \u2206U \u2261 1\/4.\nUsing the concept of optimal fluctuation (for complementary reviews of its various modi-\nfications, see [132,54]; see also some details in the sub-section 5.4.1 below), one can show\nthat the transition rate W between steady regimes q\n(1,2)\nst (t) of forced vibration around the\nminima of the potential U(q) can be described by an activation law, W \u221d exp(\u2212Sa\/T ),\nwhere the activation energy Sa is some functional minimized over the end state\n\u2192\ns e, over\nthe end time te and over the path [q(t)] \u2261 [q(1)st te\u2192\u2192s e]:\nSa = min[q(t)],\u2192s e,teS, S =\n1\n8\u0393\nte\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt \u03a02(q\u00a8, q\u02d9, q, t), (5.3.2)\nq(t\u2192 \u2212\u221e)\u2192 q(1)st (t), {q(te), q\u02d9(te)} =\u2192s e nf\u2192 q(1,2)st (t),\nq\n(1,2)\nst (t) \u2248 q(1,2)0 +\nA\n2\u2212 \u21262 cos(\u2126t), \u0393\u001c |\u2126\u2212\n\u221a\n2|.\nHere, the end state\n\u2192\ns e is any state in the phase space from which the noise-free system\ncan relax either into q\n(2)\nst (t) or into q\n(1)\nst (t).\nIf A = 0, then all states {q, q\u02d9} corresponding to q(1,2)st (t) reduce to the stationary stable\nstates\n\u2192\ns 1,2 of the undriven system, whereas the exit state\n\u2192\ns ex, i.e.\n\u2192\ns e minimizing S,\nreduces to the unstable stationary state\n\u2192\nu at the top of the barrier; the exit time tex, i.e.\nte minimizing S, becomes infinite. The path [q(t)] yielding Sa for the transition\n\u2192\ns 1\u2192\u2192u,\ncalled the most probable escape path (MPEP), is the time-reversed noise-free relaxational\ntrajectory [\n\u2192\nu\nnf\u2192\u2192s 1] (see e.g. [133,3]):\n46 It is similar to Eqs. (5.1.1) and (5.2.2) but we have to use a different normalization of the\ndamping parameter corresponding to that in [84,95] since we reproduce below the figure from\n[95] in which the relevant value of \u0393 is indicated directly in the figure.\n77\nMPEP(A = 0) \u2261 [Q(t)], Q\u00a8\u2212 2\u0393Q\u02d9+ U \u2032(Q) = 0, (5.3.3)\nQ(\u2212\u221e) = q(1)0 , Q\u02d9(\u2212\u221e) = 0, Q(\u221e) = qb, Q\u02d9(\u221e) = 0.\nThe path [Q(t)] provides Sa = \u2206U \u2261 Ub \u2212 U0, which obviously agrees with the classical\nresult for the escape rate [42].\nIn the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0, the leading-order correction to the MPEP(A = 0) \u2261 [Q(t)]\nis linear in A [95]; in particular, this concerns q\n(1)\nst and\n\u2192\ns ex. It follows from the definition\nof the MPEP [132,54] that its variation [134] is equal to zero in the linear approximation,\nso that corrections to Sa(A = 0) \u2261 \u2206U from a linear correction of the MPEP are weaker\nthan linear. Hence [95], to calculate the leading-order (linear) term in \u03b4Sa \u2261 Sa \u2212 \u2206U ,\none may use [Q(t)]:\n\u03b4Sa \u2248 \u2212|\u03c7\u02dc|A, \u03c7\u02dc \u2261 \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) = \u2212\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndtei\u2126tQ\u02d9(t), (5.3.4)\nwhere \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) may be called the spectral density of the logarithmic susceptibility [95].\nIn the static limit \u2126\u2192 0, the modulus of the spectral density |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)| approaches qb \u2212 q(1)0\nso that Sa approaches the minimum value taken by the instantaneous potential barrier\nduring one period of the driving force, as one would expect. In general, the shape of |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)|\ndepends on the interrelation between the damping parameter \u0393 and the characteristic\neigenfrequencies. For small damping, the function |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)| displays sharp peaks; and for\nsome potentials U(q) it may in fact have a distinctly multi-peaked structure (cf. Fig. 54\ncorresponding to the U(q) shown in Fig. 53). This structure can be understood if one\nexpands the velocity along the MPEP into a Fourier series in angle (cf. (3.1.7))\nQ\u02d9(t) \u2261\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(Q\u02d9n{E(t)}e\u2212in\u03c8(t) + c.c.), (5.3.5)\nwhere E and \u03c8 are respectively the energy and angle: see (3.1.6). Now, for small damping,\nenergy and angle are respectively slow and fast variables: see (A.15) in the Appendix,\nwith f(t) = 0 and allow for the additional factor of 2 in the normalization of the damping\nparameter in (5.3.1). Hence\nE\u02d9 \u2248 2\u0393\u03c9(E)I(E), \u03c8\u02d9 \u2248 \u03c9(E), (5.3.6)\nwhere \u03c9(E) is the eigenfrequency as a function of energy (cf. (2.1.8)), I(E) is the action\nas a function of energy (see (A.4)), and we dropped the terms \u221d \u0393 in the equation of\nmotion (A.15) for angle, and the fast-oscillating terms in that for energy.\nIt follows from (5.3.4)-(5.3.6) that the major contributions to \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) are provided by those\nsections of [Q(t)] that correspond to energies E(t) \u2261 (Q\u02d9(t))2\/2 + U(Q(t)) close to the\nresonant energies En(\u2126), implicitly defined as n\u03c9(En) = \u2126 where n is an integer. Labelling\n78\nwith N the resonance which provides the largest contribution to \u03b4Sa, and allowing for\nthat \u03c9(E) is approximated near EN as\n\u03c9(E) \u2248 \u03c9(EN) + d\u03c9(EN)\ndEN\n(E \u2212 EN),\none then obtains\n|\u03c7\u02dc| \u2248 |\u03c7\u02dcN | \u2261 |Q\u02d9N(EN)|\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt cos(at2)\n\uf8f6\uf8f82 +\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt sin(at2)\n\uf8f6\uf8f82 (5.3.7)\n= |Q\u02d9N(EN)|\n\u221a\npi\na\n,\na = \u0393\u2126|d\u03c9(EN)\/dEN |I(EN).\nIn deriving the final expression for |\u03c7\u02dcN |, we have used the fact that each of the integrals\nin the upper line of (5.3.7) is equal to\n\u221a\npi\/(2a) [135].\nThere are three important conclusions to be drawn from (5.3.7).\n(1) If \u2126 is only slightly less than the eigenfrequency in the bottom \u03c90 \u2261 \u03c9(Em) (note\nthat unlike in other sections, Em here denotes the minimal energy\n47 ), then the main\ncontribution comes from the 1st-order resonance i.e. for N = 1, and |\u03c7\u02dc1(\u2126)| has a\nsharp tooth-like shape near \u03c90 [95] (cf. Fig. 54):\n|\u03c7\u02dc1(\u2126)| = A(1\u2212Bx)\u03b8(x), x = \u03c90 \u2212 \u2126, 0 < 1\u2212Bx \u223c< 1, (5.3.8)\nA = [pi\/(2\u0393|\u03c9\u2032|)]1\/2, B = \u2212(2\u03c9\u2032)\u22121[(|Q\u02d92\/Q\u02d91|2)\u2032 + \u03c9\u2032\u2032\/\u03c9\u2032].\nThe derivatives over E are to be evaluated at E = Em. Similar, but much broader\nand lower, peaks arise at harmonics of \u03c90.\n(2) The divergence which would arise in (5.3.7) if we considered a ZD system, and \u2126\nwent to the extremal eigenfrequency \u2126m, indicates that for a ZD system |\u03c7\u02dc| possesses\npeaks at \u2126m and at its harmonics provided that \u0393 is small enough. The shape of the\npeaks has to be evaluated a bit differently from (5.3.7), as shown below in sub-section\n5.3.3.1.\n(3) The divergence in (5.3.7) as \u0393\u2192 0 indicates that, on one hand, the reduction in the\nactivation energy by the above resonant mechanism may grow as \u0393 decreases but\nthat, on the other hand, the range of very small \u0393 should be treated differently. It\nis this latter range that is the most interesting in the present context, and it will be\nconsidered below in sub-section 5.3.2.\nB. Directed diffusion\n47 We are obliged to use this notation here because it was used in the figure taken from [95]\nwhich we reproduce as Fig. 54.\n79\nLet us now discuss briefly how the resonant mechanism for reduction of the activation\nenergies provides for directed diffusion within a periodic potential [95]. As an example of a\nperiodic potential possessing an asymmetry within a period, let us consider the potential\nshown in Fig. 53\nU(q) = sin(q) + 0.3 sin(2q + 0.4). (5.3.9)\nWithout driving, the system is in thermal equilibrium so that, for low temperatures (T \u001c\n\u2206U), the system stays with overwhelming probability near the bottom of one of the wells,\nequally distributed between all wells. Moreover, because detailed balance holds [38], the\nprobabilities of escape from the bottom over the adjacent barriers to the left and to the\nright are equal each other. Consequently, there is no net flux.\nThe situation may become radically different if a periodic driving force is applied [95].\nDetailed balance need no longer be satisfied. The driving-induced corrections to the acti-\nvation energy may differ, depending on whether the escape occurs over the left barrier or\nover the right one. This effect is most pronounced in the range where the contributions\nfrom several overtones are substantial so that their mutual interference comes into play\n(cf. (5.3.4), (5.3.5)). This is well demonstrated by Fig. 54, where the spectral densities\nfor escapes to the left and to the right differ markedly except at a few values of \u2126. A\ndetailed study of the spectroscopy of |\u03c7\u02dc\u00b1| has not been carried out and it would be very\ninteresting to study it, especially in the ZD case: cf. sub-section 5.3.3 below. But even\nFig. 54 demonstrates that, by changing the frequency, one can control the direction of the\ndiffusion:\nJ = l(W (+) \u2212W (\u2212)) (5.3.10)\n\u221d sgn(|\u03c7\u02dc+(\u2126)| \u2212 |\u03c7\u02dc\u2212(\u2126)|) exp\n(\n\u2212\u2206U \u2212 Amax{|\u03c7\u02dc\n+(\u2126)|, |\u03c7\u02dc\u2212(\u2126)|}\nT\n)\n.\nHere l is a period of the potential, which is equal to 4pi in case of U(q) (5.3.9).\nIt should be noted also that a net flux may arise even in a symmetric potential in cases\nwhen the periodic driving force contains more than one harmonic [95]: the direction of\nthe diffusion is then controlled by the relative initial angles of relevant harmonics.\nFor high and moderate damping, the influence of non-adiabatic periodic driving on escape\nrates, and the net flux in non-adiabatically driven periodic potentials, were observed in\nanalogue experiments [126] and found to be in satisfactory agreement with theory [95].\n5.3.2 Underdamped limit\nAs can be seen from Eq. (5.3.7), the theory [95] implies an increasing escape rate that\ndiverges as \u0393 \u2192 0. Theories [122\u2013124] based on the mechanism of diffusion over energy\nalso diverge as \u0393\u2192 0. These divergences suggest that the system should be underdamped\nin order for the escape rate to reach the maximum value possible. On the other hand, the\n80\ntheories in question can predict neither (i) the maximum increase, nor (ii) the conditions\nunder which it occurs, and nor (iii) can they illuminate the underlying mechanism. Thus,\nit is extremely important to study the problem in the underdamped limit. This is the\nmajor purpose of the present sub-section, which to a large extent follows [84] completed\nby the most recent results from [119].\nLet us again consider Eq. (5.3.1) but, unlike the previous sub-section, we shall not assume\nthat A is necessarily the smallest parameter in the problem after the temperature. At the\nsame time, A is still assumed to be small. Contributions to the decrease in activation\nenergy that are \u221d An with n > 1 will therefore be neglected.\nThe presence of the periodic driving affects Sa in three different ways: (1) by shifting the\nstarting energy Est, i.e. the energy of the starting state\n\u2192\ns st (belonging to q\n(1)\nst ), away from\nE(\n\u2192\ns 1) = U0; (2) by shifting the exit energy Eex \u2261 E(\u2192s ex) \u2261 q\u02d92ex\/2 + U(qex) away from\nE(\n\u2192\nu) = Ub; and (3) by causing a breakdown of the relation Sa = Eex \u2212 Est. Correspond-\ningly, we divide \u03b4Sa \u2261 Sa \u2212\u2206U formally into three parts:\n\u03b4Sa \u2261 \u03b4S(st)a + \u03b4S(ex)a + \u03b4S(r)a , (5.3.11)\n\u03b4S(st)a \u2261 U0 \u2212 Est, \u03b4S(ex)a \u2261 Eex \u2212 Ub, \u03b4S(r)a \u2261 Sa \u2212 (Eex \u2212 Est).\nThe maximum deviation of energy on the attractor q\n(1)\nst (t) from U0 is\n\u2248 {Amax(\u2126,\u221a2)\/(2\u2212 \u21262)}2\/2. Thus,\n\u2212\u03b4S(st)a \u2261 Est \u2212 U0 <\n1\n2\n(\nmax(\u2126,\n\u221a\n2)\n2\u2212 \u21262\n)2\nA2, (5.3.12)\nand may be neglected in comparison with the other two terms in (5.3.11) (see below)\nunless \u2126 is very close to\n\u221a\n2; the latter narrow range will be considered neither here nor\nin what follows.\nWhile evaluating two other terms in (5.3.11), it is convenient to resolve the cases of\nvanishingly and moderately small A.\n5.3.2.1 Asymptotic limit A\u2192 0.\nObviously, the limit of a vanishingly small driving amplitude is not of practical interest,\nbecause the decrease of Sa is then negligible; at the same time, its consideration allows\nus to resolve best of all different physical mechanisms by which the driving affects Sa. In\nturn, this provides a better understanding of the case of moderately small A, which is\npotentially important in situations of practical importance. We shall evaluate the terms\n\u03b4S(ex)a and \u03b4S\n(r)\na separately, respectively in stages (1) and (2) below.\n(1) To evaluate \u03b4S(ex)a we note first that \u03b4S\n(r)\na is dominated by contributions from the\nnarrow range of resonant energies, and therefore its dependence on\n\u2192\ns e from the\nrelevant range of energies \u2248 Ub is weak (cf. (5.3.4), (5.3.7) as well as stage (2)\n81\nbelow). We shall assume that the latter dependence is weak enough for one to be\nable to derive \u03b4S(ex)a merely from the minimization of E(\n\u2192\ns e) over\n\u2192\ns e, independently\nof \u03b4S(r)a . So, when this assumption is true\n48 , then, to leading order in A,\n\u2192\ns ex is the\nstate which, among all possible\n\u2192\ns e, has the minimal energy, Emin:\n\u03b4S(ex)a \u2248 Emin \u2212 Ub. (5.3.13)\nFor A\/\u0393\u2192 0, \u2192s ex belongs to the unstable periodic orbit near the top of the barrier\n[95]. So, Ub \u2212 Emin \u2248 A2\/(2(1 + \u21262)2), and \u2212\u03b4S(ex)a can be neglected in comparison\nwith \u2212\u03b4S(r)a \u2248 \u2212|\u03c7\u02dc|A (see Eq. (5.3.4)).\nOn the other hand, if\nA > Ac \u2248 \u00b5l\u0393, \u00b5l = 4\n\u221a\n2cosh(pi\u2126\/2)\n3pi\u2126\n, (5.3.14)\n(\u00b5l \u223c 1 at \u2126 \u223c 1, so that Ac \u223c \u0393), then a homoclinic tangle arises in the noise-\nfree system [60] leading, in Poincare\u00b4 section, to a complex mixing of the basins of\nattraction of q\n(1,2)\nst in a layer around the boundary separating the attracting basins\nof the stable states of the undriven system (Fig. 55). To first order in A, Emin may\nbe approximated by the minimum energy in that part of the basin of attraction of\nq\n(2)\nst where q < qb = 0, additionally minimized over the angle of the Poincare\u00b4 section.\nIt can be shown (in the same way as (5.3.14) is derived in [60]) that, to first order in\nA, Emin < Ub if and only if the condition (5.3.14) holds. If (5.3.14) holds and \u2126 \u223c 1,\nthen (Ub \u2212 Emin)\/A \u223c 1.\nOne can readily find Emin numerically, just by integrating the dissipative equation\n(5.3.1) in the absence of noise (T = 0). This should be done for a variety of initial\ndriving force angles in the interval [0, 2pi] and on a grid of initial states with q < 0,\nchoosing from them that state which has the minimum energy among those states\nfrom which the system relaxes to the attractor q\n(2)\nst : this energy approximates Emin,\nto first order in A.\nFor A \u001d Ac \u223c \u0393, the numerical search for Emin can significantly be simplified:\nthe lower-energy boundary of the layer then coincides approximately with the lower-\nenergy boundary of the corresponding chaotic layer of the non-dissipative system,\nnamely, of the chaotic layer which includes the state {q = qb, q\u02d9 = 0}. At the same\ntime it can be shown that the minimal energy in a Poincare\u00b4 section of the chaotic\nlayer, E(nd)m , is independent of the angle at which the section is taken; so, Emin \u2248\nE(nd)m . The explicit formula for E\n(nd)\nm is unknown [136] but, in the light of the above\nremarks, the chaotic layer is readily generated by computer, using {q = qb, q\u02d9 = 0}\nas the initial state of the system while an initial angle for the driving force may\nbe chosen arbitrarily. Thus, E(nd)m can very easily be found numerically. Its detailed\nanalysis will be presented elsewhere; here, we present characteristic examples of the\ndependence of Ub \u2212 E(nd)m on the amplitude and frequency of the driving force. The\n48 We shall indicate in the last paragraph of the item (2) below the ranges of A where this\nassumption fails. But even in those ranges, eq.(5.3.13) provides for \u2212\u03b4S(ex)a the estimation from\nabove, which will turn out quite enough for it to be neglected in the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0. At\nthe same time, \u03b4S\n(ex)\na (5.3.13) will provide the major contribution in the range of moderately\nsmall A, as shown in Sec. 5.3.2.2 below.\n82\namplitude dependence is ladder-like (Fig. 56(a)); the frequency dependence exhibits\nsharp peaks (Fig. 56(b)). The jumps in the first case and the peaks in the latter\ncorrespond to the occurrence of overlap\/separation between nonlinear resonances.\nLet us first demonstrate it for the frequency dependence.\nFor very small \u2126, the relevant chaotic layer relates only to the separatrix of the\nundriven system and Ub \u2212 E(nd)m \u221d \u2126A [35]. As \u2126 grows, the resonant energy E1(\u2126)\nsharply decreases and, starting from \u2126 = \u21261 \u2248 2pi\/ ln(1\/A), the lower part of the\nchaotic layer relates to the lower part of the nonlinear resonance [5,35,60,136] while\nthe upper part of the layer still relates to the separatrix of the undriven system. Both\nparts are clearly resolved in Poincare\u00b4 section: Fig. 57(a); cf. also sub-section 4.3.2.\nThus, Ub \u2212 E(nd)m grows rapidly and reaches the first maximum for \u2126 slightly larger\nthan \u21261. As \u2126 grows further, the layer related to the nonlinear resonance separates\nfrom the layer around the original separatrix. It can then no longer provide inter-well\nchaotic transport (Fig. 57(b)). Consequently, Ub \u2212 E(nd)m drops abruptly. The peaks\nat multiple frequencies correspond to higher-order resonances.\nSimilarly, as A grows, Ub \u2212 E(nd)m undergoes large jumps at An \u223c exp(\u22122pin\/\u2126),\nrelated to successive overlaps between the layer associated with the original separatrix\nand the layers associated with nonlinear resonances. Note however that the largest\nAn, namely A[\u2126\/\n\u221a\n2]+1, is typically still quite small \u2013 unless \u2126 is only slightly less\nthan the eigenfrequency at the bottom,\n\u221a\n2. Further growth of Ub \u2212 E(nd)m with A\nis approximately linear, provided A \u001c 1. Thus, for most of the range A \u001c 1, the\nquantity (Ub \u2212 E(nd)m )\/A plays a role similar to that of |\u03c7\u02dc| in (5.3.4).\nThe question of the relevance\/non-relevance of the above peaks and jumps to the\nfrequency and amplitude dependences of \u03b4Sa respectively will be discussed at the\nend of the (2) below.\n(2) We next wish to evaluate, or at least to estimate, the last term in \u03b4Sa (5.3.11) i.e.\n\u03b4S(r)a .\nLet us first try to generalize the evaluation of this part [95] corresponding to the\ncase when the homoclinic tangle and related reduction in the exit energy are absent\n(described in part A of Sec. 5.3.1 above) for the more general case in which the tangle\nand reduction may be present. Using arguments similar to those of [95], \u03b4S(r)a may\nbe described by the formula\n\u03b4S(r)a \u2248 \u2212|\u02dc\u02dc\u03c7|A, \u02dc\u02dc\u03c7 = \u2212\ntex\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndtei\u2126t \u02d9\u02dcQ(t), (5.3.15)\nwhere Q\u02dc(t) is the time-reversal of the noise-free relaxation from\n\u2192\ns ex. As when the\nhomoclinic tangle is absent, the main mechanism contributing to \u02dc\u02dc\u03c7 at small \u0393 is the\nresonant one, so that |\u02dc\u02dc\u03c7| \u2248 |\u03c7\u02dcN | as in (5.3.7).\nWe now consider how to estimate the value of \u0393 at which the resonant mechanism\nsaturates and where (5.3.15) is no longer valid. It is a difficult problem: it requires\nus to find the next term in \u03b4S(r)a , after the term \u221d A, while the latter requires us to\nfind the correction \u221d A in the MPEP and then to find the corresponding correction\nto the activation energy; moreover, as is obvious from (5.3.1) and (5.3.2), the part of\nthe second-order (i.e. \u221d A2) correction to the activation energy that comes from the\n83\nsecond-order correction in the integrand \u03a02 of (5.3.2) diverges 49 . Altogether, there\nare enormous technical difficulties and we have failed to overcome them. Instead, we\nsuggest below a way of estimating a quantity \u0393r such that Eq. (5.3.15) is definitely\ninvalid for all \u0393 < \u0393r. The most straightforward way would be to use the fact that\n\u2212\u03b4S(r)a cannot exceed Eex\u2212Est. This would give rise to an estimate \u0393r \u221d A2. However,\nit is possible to find much higher \u0393r. Indeed, the main contribution to the integrals\nin (5.3.7) comes from the range of t within which the absolute value of the argument\nof the trigonometric functions is\n\u223c\n< pi\/2, i.e. |t| \u223c< tr \u2261\n\u221a\npi\/(2a) \u221d \u0393\u22121\/2. In this\nrange, the energy along the MPEP, E \u2248 \u02d9\u02dcQ\n2\n\/2 + U(Q\u02dc), increases from EN \u2212\u2206Er\/2\nto EN + \u2206Er\/2 where\n\u2206Er \u2248 2\u0393\u03c9(EN)I(EN)2tr \u221d\n\u221a\n\u0393. (5.3.16)\nThe unperturbed part of the activation energy associated with a noise-induced in-\ncrease of energy for \u2206Er is equal to \u2206Er. Thus, the perturbative formula (5.3.15)\n(as well as its partial case (5.3.4)) is valid as long as the absolute value of the\nnegative correction due to the resonant mechanism in the range [\u2212tr, tr], which is\n\u223c |Q\u02d9N(EN)|trA, is less than \u2206Er. Hence,\n\u0393r \u223c A\/\u00b5r, \u00b5r = [\u03c9I\/|Q\u02d9N |]E=EN . (5.3.17)\nTypically, \u00b5r \u223c| Q\u02d921\/Q\u02d9N |. Thus, typically, \u00b5r \u223c 1 if the relevant resonance number\nN is 1 while \u00b5r \u001d 1 otherwise.\nOf course, it cannot be guaranteed that the resonant mechanism (and the corre-\nsponding Eq. (3.5.15)) is valid for all \u0393\u001d \u0393r but this is quite likely and, if it is valid\nindeed, then the saturation of the growth of \u2212\u03b4S(r)a as \u0393 decreases occurs at \u0393 \u223c \u0393r,\ntypically at the level\n\u2212\u03b4S(r)a \u223c\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a |Q\u02d9N |A\n|d\u03c9(EN)\/dEN | \u221d\n\u221a\nA, (5.3.18)\ni.e. it greatly exceeds \u2212\u03b4S(ex)a \u221d A, given that A\u2192 0.\nThe next question is: what is \u03b4S(r)a for \u0393 \u001c \u0393r? A rigorous treatment of this diffi-\ncult problem has not yet been achieved. The authors of [84] suggested an intuitive\nargument in favour of a vanishing \u03b4S(r)a as \u0393 \u2192 0: the resonant mechanism affects\nmainly the \u201cresonant\u201d energies i.e. those in the band [EN \u2212 \u2206Er\/2, EN + \u2206Er\/2];\nhence, \u2212\u03b4S(r)a is not likely to exceed the width of this band significantly,\n\u2212\u03b4S(r)a\n\u223c\n< \u2206Er \u221d\n\u221a\n\u0393\n\u0393\u21920\u2212\u2192 0, \u0393 \u223c< A. (5.3.19)\nThe results of computer simulations 50 [84] seemed to support this hypothesis: as\nseen from Fig. 58, \u03b4Sa reduces to \u03b4S\n(ex)\na as \u0393\/A\u2192 0. However recent simulations in\n49 In fact, this divergence indicates that the next-order (after the first-order) correction in \u03b4S\n(r)\na\nis probably non-analytic, i.e. that its second derivative is likely to diverge at A = 0.\n50 Eq. (5.3.1) was simulated numerically, and the transition flux from q\n(1)\nst (t) to q\n(2)\nst (t), J \u2261\nJ(A, T ) \u2261 P (A, T ) exp(\u2212Sa(A)\/T ), was measured at two slightly different low temperatures,\nboth for a given A and for A = 0. The activation energy was then calculated as Sa \u2248 [T1T2\/(T1\u2212\n84\nsome other system [119] (see the Sec. 5.3.3 below, in particular Fig. 64) and more\ncareful qualitative theoretical analysis [119] have shown that the hypothesis about\nthe vanishing of \u03b4S(r)a in the underdamped limit is not valid in general, while the\nargument [84] about the vanishing of \u2206Er (5.3.16) as \u0393\u2192 0 is irrelevant because the\nperturbation theory on which Eq. (5.3.16) is based becomes inapplicable at \u0393\n<\u223c \u0393r.\nIt is still not clear how to solve the problem quantitatively but some qualitative\nunderstanding may be gained from [129] (see also the review [2]). This paper considers\nfluctuational transitions in a weakly nonlinear single-well oscillator driven by a nearly\nresonant periodic force. In the absence of noise, such a system possesses two stable\nstates which, in the asymptotic limit of vanishing damping, correspond to a linear\nresponse and nonlinear resonance respectively (cf. Sec. 4 above). To solve the problem\nof fluctuational transitions between these two states, the authors of [129] transform\nto slow variables (cf. the transformation to slow action and slow angle in Sec. 4),\nand then consider by the method of optimal fluctuation transitions from each of the\ntwo states to the saddle on the boundary between their basins of attraction in the\nplane of the slow variables. In the asymptotic limit of a small driving amplitude\nA (but with the damping parameter still assumed to be much smaller), the linear\nresponse attractor corresponds to energies close to the very bottom of the potential\nwell (i.e. U0) while both the saddle and the attractor of the nonlinear resonance\ncorrespond approximately to the resonance energy Er i.e. to such an energy for which\nthe eigenoscillation and driving frequencies are equal: \u03c9(Er) = \u2126. In the asymptotic\nlimit A \u2192 0, the activation energy Slrs for the transition from the linear response\nattractor to the saddle can be found explicitly [129]\nSlrs = (Er \u2212 U0)\u2212 \u03be\u221a\n2\n\u2206Enr, (5.3.20)\n\u2206Enr = 2\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aA\u221aEr\/2\nd\u03c9\/dE\n\u221d\n\u221a\nA, \u03be \u2248 0.98.\nThus, the deviation of Slrs from just the difference in energy between the starting\nand ending states, Er \u2212 U0, which is similar to \u03b4S(r)a in our problem, is of the order\nof \u2206Enr in absolute value. As in the case of \u0393 \u001d A [95], this deviation is yielded\nmainly in the narrow (\u223c \u2206Enr) band of energies near Er, though the mechanism is\ndifferent.\nOf course, the method of [129] is not immediately applicable to our case where\nthe eigenfrequency varies over a broad range (from 0 to \u03c90) and it is impossible\nto introduce slow variables which would be valid in the whole relevant range of\nenergies. The same is true of the method used in [130], which in particular considers\nthe same problem as in [129] and also uses a transformation to slow variables but the\nconsideration is done in terms of the Fokker-Plank equation rather than by means of\nthe method of optimal fluctuation. On the other hand, the results of [129] indicate\nthat \u2212\u03b4S(r)a does not vanish as \u0393 \u2192 0; rather it is of the order of the width of the\nT2)] ln[J\u02dc(A, T1)\/J\u02dc(A, T2)], where J\u02dc(A, T ) \u2261 J(A, T )\/J(A = 0, T ) (comparison with the case\nA = 0 was made in order to reduce as much as possible the influence of the prefactor P in the\ndetermination of Sa; note that T1 and T2 were chosen such that T1 \u001c \u2206U while |T1 \u2212 T2| \u223c\nT 21 \/\u2206U).\n85\nbroadest nonlinear resonance. Note that it is of the same order as the value \u2212\u03b4S(r)a\n(5.3.18) (the latter corresponds to the saturation of the resonant mechanism [95]\nat \u0393 \u223c A\/\u00b5r; besides, we obviously assume that N = 1 in (5.3.18), otherwise the\ncomparison with (5.3.20) would not make sense).\nIt is also obvious from the above discussion that the jumps and peaks in the ampli-\ntude and frequency dependences of Ub\u2212E(nd)m are not manifested in the corresponding\ndependences of \u2212\u03b4Sa: apart from the fact that \u2212\u03b4S(ex)a is on the whole much smaller\nthan the major nonlinear resonance contribution \u221d \u221aA, there are no jumps\/peaks\neven in \u2212\u03b4S(ex)a itself. Indeed, the jumps\/peaks in Ub\u2212E(nd)m are related to the recon-\nnection of the chaotic layer around the original separatrix with the thin chaotic layers\naround the separatrices of nonlinear resonances of a high order while \u2013 as is obvious\nfrom results [129] and from the discussion above \u2013 the end state in the problem of a\nfluctuational transition from a state of low energy towards the separatrix of a non-\nlinear resonance is the saddle, rather than the lowest energy state of the separatrix.\nFurthermore, the corresponding activation energy is not just the difference in energy\nbetween the final and initial states. Note that the resonance width constitutes a jump\nin Ub\u2212E(nd)m at a relevant value of A. Thus, it may be expected that the contribution\nto \u2212\u03b4Sa from the range of energies close to the barrier can be described by Ub\u2212E(nd)m\nsmoothed over the jumps, i.e. this contribution coincides with Ub \u2212 E(nd)m only if A\nlies beyond the vicinity of jumps in the corresponding amplitude dependence in Fig.\n56(a) (cf. also Fig. 58 and the discussion in Sec. 5.3.2.2 below). In any case, in the\nlimit A \u2192 0 considered, this contribution may be neglected in comparison with the\ncontribution from the major nonlinear resonance.\nThus, it seems that, in the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0, the evolution of \u2212\u03b4Sa as \u0393 decreases\nshould occur in the following manner: for \u0393\u001d A\/\u00b5r, it grows due to the resonant mecha-\nnism [95], i.e. \u221d \u0393\u22121\/2 according to Eqs. (5.3.4) and (5.3.7); this growth starts to saturate\nat \u0393 \u223c A\/\u00b5r while a relatively small addition \u223c A arises at \u0393 \u223c A\/\u00b5l (these ranges often\ncoincide) due to the reduction in the exit energy caused by the homoclinic tangle [84] as\ndescribed by Eq. (5.3.13); with further decrease of \u0393, when it becomes \u001c A\/max(\u00b5r, \u00b5l),\nthe reduction in exit energy saturates at the level \u223c A [84], while the contribution from\nthe range of resonant energies remains dominant and of the same order (i.e. \u221d \u221aA) as\nat \u0393 \u223c A\/\u00b5r, though by a different mechanism. The latter involves a large fluctuation\nthrough the range of the broadest nonlinear resonance in the plane of the slow variables\n[129,119], i.e. it is associated with a characteristic change of the MPEP in the vicinity of\nthe major nonlinear resonance.\nWe may conclude that, in the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0, the largest decrease in activation\nenergy occurs at \u0393\n<\u223c A\/\u00b5r, the major contribution to it comes from the range of the\nbroadest nonlinear resonance, the decrease being of the order of the resonance width in\nenergy.\n5.3.2.2 The range of moderately small A.\nAn obvious question which may arise in relation to Sec. 5.3.2.1 is: how does its conclusion\nabout the dominance of the nonlinear resonance contribution (rather than of the reduction\nin exit energy) in the decrease of Sa in the underdamped limit agree with the results of the\n86\nsimulations [84] presented in Fig. 58? Indeed, one can clearly see in both Fig. 58(a) and Fig.\n58(b) that, in those ranges of A and \u0393 where \u0393\/A\u001c 1 (i.e. in the distinctly underdapmed\nregime), the decrease of the activation energy in simulations is nearly exactly equal to\nUb\u2212Em i.e. to the lowering of the minimal energy in the layer of transient chaos (i.e. layer\nof mixed basins), which appears at first sight to contradict the conclusion of Sec. 5.3.2.1.\nTo resolve the paradox we note that the conclusion of Sec. 5.3.2.1 relates to the asymptotic\nlimit A \u2192 0, when the layer of transient chaos is distinctly separated from the lowest\nnonlinear resonance. But, if the latter is much closer to the barrier level Ub than to the\nbottom U0, then there exists a range of moderately weak driving amplitudes which are\nweak enough for a linear response to exist but, at the same time, large enough to provide\na complete absorption of the energy range of the lowest nonlinear resonance by the layer of\ntransient chaos. When such an absorption takes place, then obviously only one mechanism\nof the decrease of Sa remains relevant \u2013 the lowering of the exit energy due to the layer\nof transient chaos.\nNote that, in the case of a conventional potential well like that of the Duffing or multi-well\nSQUID potentials, \u03c9(E) decreases monotonically from \u03c90 to 0, with the major decrease\noccurring in a narrow vicinity of the barrier level: cf. e.g. those branches of \u03c9(E) in Fig.\n4(b) which correspond to wells of the multi-well SQUID potential shown in Fig. 3(b). For\n\u03c90 of such type, the absorption described in the previous paragraph is valid in the major\npart of the relevant 51 driving frequency range \u2126\n\u223c\n< \u03c90, namely in the whole range \u2126\n\u223c\n< \u03c90\nexcept the close vicinity of the bottom eigenfrequency \u03c90 or of any of its harmonics of\nmoderate order, i.e.\n([\n\u2126\n\u03c90\n]\n+ 1\n)\n\u03c90 \u2212 \u2126 \u223c \u03c90, (5.3.21)\n\u2126\n\u223c\n< \u03c90,\nwhere the square brackets imply taking the integer part. Indeed, the order of the lowest\nnonlinear resonance, which in the case (5.3.21) is also the broadest one, is N = [\u2126\/\u03c90]+1.\nAllowing for (5.3.21), the deviation of the relevant resonant energy EN from Ub is much\nless than the barrier height \u2206U : e.g. for the Duffing oscillator used in [84] (see (5.3.1)\nabove), it may be described by the following asymptotic formula [29]\nUb \u2212 EN \u2248 64\u2206U exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2pi\n\u2126\/N\n)\n\u001c 1. (5.3.22)\nCorrespondingly, if the driving is moderately weak, namely\n\u2206U \u001d A\u001d Ub \u2212 EN , (5.3.23)\n51 When \u2126 \u001d \u03c90, the layer of transient chaos is exponentially narrow [35,60,136] while the\nrelevant nonlinear resonances are of a high order and therefore are very narrow too. The effect\nof driving on the activation energy is therefore negligible.\n87\nthen the nonlinear resonance mechanism for the decrease of Sa is irrelevant, so that\nSa \u2248 \u03b4S(ex)a \u2248 Ub \u2212 Em. (5.3.24)\nJust such a situation relates to Fig. 58: \u2126 = 1.7 while \u03c90 =\n\u221a\n2, so that the lowest\nnonlinear resonance has the order N = 2 and the deviation of the corresponding resonant\nenergy from the barrier level Ub \u2212 E2 \u2248 0.01 is much less than both \u2206U = 0.25 and\nrelevant values of A. Thus, (5.3.23) is satisfied and, hence, Eq. (5.3.24) holds.\nLet us now briefly discuss the narrow frequency range that remains, namely that just\nbelow \u03c90,\n0 < \u03c90 \u2212 \u2126\u001c \u03c90, (5.3.25)\nand its harmonics of a moderate order,\n([\n\u2126\n\u03c90\n]\n+ 1\n)\n\u03c90 \u2212 \u2126\u001c \u03c90, (5.3.26)\n1 \u2264 [\u2126\/\u03c90], \u2126 \u223c \u03c90.\nIn the frequency range (5.3.25), the regime of moderately weak driving is usually im-\npossible: the lowest nonlinear resonance occurs close to the bottom providing that the\ndriving is really weak; while, as the driving amplitude increases, linear response typically\ndisappears before the layer of transient chaos reaches the energy range of the resonance.\nIn the frequency range (5.3.26), the lowest possible nonlinear resonance has the order\nN = [\u2126\/\u03c90] + 1 > 1 and corresponds to energies close to the bottom of the well. The\ncorresponding harmonic qN(EN) is very small (EN lies in the range of nearly harmonic\neigenoscillation) so that the corresponding resonance is either very narrow or even non-\nexistent, being suppressed by the linear response. Thus, the broadest nonlinear resonance\nin this case, that of order N + 1: \u2126\/(N + 1), is distinctly lower than \u03c90 and the relevant\nharmonic qN+1(EN+1) is much larger than qN(EN) since EN is close to U0 while EN+1 is\nnot (cf. [29]). Thus, there exists a range of driving which plays a role similar to that of\nmoderately weak driving in the range (5.3.21), i.e. the layer of transient chaos absorbs the\nbroadest nonlinear resonance and thus remains the only mechanism that decreases the\nactivation energy.\n5.3.2.3 Discussion in the contexts of directed diffusion and of the interplay between chaos\nand noise.\nLet us discuss briefly the application of the results [84,119] reviewed above to the problem\nof directed diffusion in periodic potentials with weak damping [95] (cf. item B in sub-\nsection 5.3.1). The theory [95] predicts that the activation energies for escape to adjacent\nwells to the left and right typically differ: thus the fluxes to the left and to the right may\ndiffer exponentially strongly. Moreover, this difference grows as \u0393 \u2192 0. It follows from\n88\nthe results of [84], however, that this growth saturates at least at \u0393 \u223c A\/\u00b5r, i.e. well\nbefore the correction [95] to the activation energy becomes comparable with the potential\nbarrier, which occurs at \u0393 \u223c A2. Furthermore, if \u0393\/A becomes smaller than \u00b5\u22121l \u223c 1 (see\nEq. (5.3.13)), then the difference between the activation energies disappears: a layer with\nmixed basins (transient chaos) is formed. As soon as the system reaches any point within\nthis layer, it may be transported either towards the well on the left, or towards that on the\nright, with probabilities of the same order. But if certain space-time symmetries [131] are\nbroken, noise-free transport within the layer may be asymmetric, at least on finite time\nscales, so that the pre-exponential factors may differ and a net flux may still be present\ndespite the onset of the layer.\nFinally, we set the results [84,119] in the context of studies of the interplay between\nchaos and noise (cf. [60]). Most of such works have studied the effect of noise on transport\nproperties within a chaotic attractor\/layer\/web. In [137], the dependence on noise intensity\nfor noise-induced inter-attractor hoppings in a multi-attractor map with transient chaos\nwas studied in simulations. But neither of these works studied how transient chaos affects\nnoise-induced escape.\n5.3.3 Particular features of escape and directed diffusion in ZD systems\nIf, instead of the Duffing potential, we consider in Eq. (5.3.1) a potential U(q) which\npossesses the zero-dispersion property, i.e. such that the corresponding \u03c9(E) possesses an\nextremum at some energy Ee\n52 , then the major resonance near the extreme eigenfre-\nquency \u03c9(Ee) is very broad in energy and, therefore, the effect of driving of the frequency\n\u2126 \u2248 \u03c9(Ee) on the escape rate and the related directed diffusion may be expected to be\nespecially pronounced. This expectation has been confirmed by both a theoretical analysis\nand simulations carried out in [119], whose results are reviewed in this sub-section.\n5.3.3.1 Peaks in the spectral density of the logarithmic susceptibility.\nThe asymptotic formula (5.3.7), valid for A\u001c \u0393\u001c \u03c9(EN), diverges as d\u03c9(EN)\/dEN \u2192 0.\nTo obtain the correct asymptote for this case, one needs to take account of the first non-\nzero term in the Taylor expansion of \u03c9(E) in powers of (E\u2212Ee). Typically, an extremum\nis a maximum or a minimum, with a non-zero 2nd derivative associated with it. Near the\nextremum, one may use the parabolic approximation:\n\u03c9(E) \u2248 \u2126m + 1\n2\nd2\u03c9(Ee)\ndE2e\n(E \u2212 Ee)2. (5.3.27)\nSo, if the driving frequency \u2126 is close to N\u2126m, one obtains from (5.3.4)-(5.3.6),(5.3.27)\n52 In other sections, such an energy was denoted Em (see e.g. Eq. (1.0.5)), but we cannot use\nthe latter in sub-section 5.3 since we had to use this notation in 5.3.1 in a different context (see\nfootnote 47 above and the text preceding its citation) following [95] whose figure, using this\nnotation, is reproduced here as Fig. 54.\n89\n|\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)| \u2248 |\u03c7\u02dc(ZD)(\u2126)| (5.3.28)\n\u2261 |Q\u02d9N(Ee)\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt cos\n(\n(\u2126\u2212N\u2126m)t\u2212 2d\n2\u03c9(Ee)\/dE\n2\ne [\u0393\u2126mI(Ee)]\n2\n3N\nt3\n)\n|\n= C\n(ls)\nscale|Ai(\u2212\u2206\u2126(ls)N )|,\nC\n(ls)\nscale =\n2pi|Q\u02d9N(Ee)|\n\u2206\u2126\n(ZD)\nN\n,\n\u2206\u2126\n(ls)\nN = sgn(d\n2\u03c9(Ee)\/dE\n2\ne )\n\u2126\u2212N\u2126m\n\u2206\u2126\n(ZD)\nN\n,\n\u2206\u2126\n(ZD)\nN =\n(\n2|d2\u03c9(Ee)\/dE2e |[\u0393\u2126mI(Ee)]2\nN\n)1\/3\n,\nwhere Ai(x) is the Airy function [49]; we have used an explicit expression [135] for the\nintegral in the 2nd line of (5.3.28).\nEq. (5.3.28) provides a universal description of zero-dispersion peaks in the spectra of the\nlogarithmic susceptibility; cf. Eq. (3.3.19) which provides a universal description of ZDPs\nin spectra of the conventional susceptibility [7,46].\nThe shape of the peak, given by the modulus of the Airy function, is shown in Fig.\n59. It is strongly asymmetric: one of its wings decays rather fast while the other wing\noscillates between some slowly decaying upper limit and zero, which is a consequence of\nan interference between relevant contributions from different parts along the MPEP.\nThe magnitude of the peak, C\n(ls)\nscale, is proportional to \u0393\n\u22122\/3. It therefore grows with decrease\nof \u0393 slightly faster than the conventional peak related to oscillations in the bottom of the\npotential well [95] (which \u221d \u0393\u22121\/2: see Eq. (5.3.8)). The widths of each sub-peak, as well\nas of the peak as a whole, are \u221d \u03932\/3, and thus tend to zero as \u0393 \u2192 0, unlike the width\nof the \u201cbottom\u201d peak (which remains finite in the underdamped limit: cf. Figs. 54, 60).\nObviously, Eq. (5.3.28) assumes: (i) that the width of the peak is much less than the\nfrequency of the maximum; and (ii) that the peak is well separated from other peaks in\nthe spectrum. Both of these requirements are satisfied in the asymptotic limit \u0393 \u2192 0,\nwhich is well demonstrated by the insets in Fig. 60, presenting |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)| for the escapes to\nthe left and to the right (denoted \u03c7\u02dc(\u2212) and \u03c7\u02dc(+) respectively) in the periodic potential\nshown in Fig. 61(a). The relevant peak relates to N = 1 and to the local maximum 53\n\u2126m in \u03c9(E) shown in Fig. 61(b). At \u0393 = 10\n\u22123 (Fig. 60(c)), the asymptotic formula nicely\ndescribes the first two sub-peaks. Sub-peaks with higher ordinal number are lower than\nthe corresponding sub-peaks according to the asymptotic formula since the shape of the\nlatter assumes a purely parabolic shape of \u03c9(E) within a broader range of energies than\noccurs in reality. At \u0393 = 10\u22122 (Fig. 60(b)), the width of each sub-peak becomes about 5\n53 The local minimum at \u2126\n(1)\nm is so sharp that the relevant range of energies is very narrow and,\ngiven that \u2126\n(1)\nm is rather close to \u2126m, the contribution from this range of energies at the values\nof \u0393 explored in Fig. 60 is negligible in comparison with that from the range related to the local\nmaximum.\n90\ntimes larger and only the first few of them can be manifested in the spectrum since those\nof higher ordinal number would involve energy ranges which, in reality, are much beyond\nthe range relevant to the local maximum in \u03c9(E). Nonetheless, the description of the first\n(i.e. highest) sub-peak by the asymptotic formula is satisfactory. The value related to Fig.\n60(a), \u0393 = 10\u22121, definitely exceeds the upper limit for the validity of Eq. (5.3.28) but,\neven at this \u0393, the peak in |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2212)(\u2126)| still exists and, moreover, is qualitatively described\nby Eq. (5.3.28).\nOne can also see some manifestation of ZDPs on the 2nd and 3rd harmonics, especially\nin Fig. 60(c). However, at the given range of \u0393 they interfere strongly with contributions\nfrom other energy ranges, as we now discuss.\n5.3.3.2 Directed diffusion in the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0.\nAs was briefly demonstrated in sub-section 5.3.1, the interference between different har-\nmonics of |\u03c7\u02dc| (5.3.4)-(5.3.6) for asymmetric 54 periodic potentials may give rise to inequal-\nity of the spectral densities related to escape to the left or to the right, leading in turn to\nthe onset of directed diffusion.\nWe demonstrate below both qualitatively and by means of numerical calculations that,\nsimilarly to the non-ZD case, the difference between |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2212)| and |\u03c7\u02dc(+)| under ZD conditions\nalso oscillates as \u0393\u2192 0, but the amplitude of the oscillations is typically larger. Indeed, as\nshown in section A above, the ZD contribution \u03c7\u02dc(ZD) into \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126 = N\u2126m) (5.3.4)-(5.3.6) (i.e.\nthe contribution made to the integral (5.3.4) by the Nth harmonic in the range of t close\nto te where te corresponds in (5.3.5) to E(te) = Ee) is \u221d \u0393\u22122\/3 \u0393\u21920\u2192 \u221e. Contributions from\nother energy ranges, including in particular those related to other harmonics, are typically\n\u221d \u0393\u22121\/2 (see Eq. (5.3.7)), i.e. they grow slower as \u0393\u2192 0. Therefore, the ZD contribution\ndominates as \u0393\u2192 0. Let the second largest (absolute) contribution to \u03c7\u02dc(N\u2126m) correspond\nto some harmonic n = ns while the range of t is close to tns , where tns corresponds to\nsuch E(tns) in (5.3.5) that ns\u03c9(E(tns)) = N\u2126m. As \u0393\u2192 0, the relevant angle differences\nprojected onto the 2pi range, namely\n\u2206\u03c8(\u00b1)\u2261N\u03c8(\u00b1)(te)\u2212 ns\u03c8(\u00b1)(tns) +N\u2126m(tns \u2212 te)\n\u22122pi\n[\nN\u03c8(\u00b1)(te)\u2212 ns\u03c8(\u00b1)(tns) +N\u2126m(tns \u2212 te)\n2pi\n]\n,\noscillate between 0 and 2pi, and the smaller \u0393 is, the faster these oscillations in \u0393 become,\nwith a period \u221d \u03932. Moreover, if the potential is asymmetric, then the difference between\n\u2206\u03c8(+) and \u2206\u03c8(\u2212) also oscillates; and the smaller \u0393, the faster the oscillations become.\nThus, as \u0393 decreases, the situation when the (relatively small) non-ZD contribution is\nextracted from the (much larger) ZD one alternates with the situation when the contri-\nbutions are added to each other. Moreover, in the asymmetric potential this alternation\n54 The asymmetry is essential only for the case of a monochromatic periodic force while, in case\nof a multi-harmonic periodic force, directed diffusion may also arise in symmetric potentials [95].\n91\noccurs differently for escape to the left and to the right. So, the direction of the diffusion\nalternates as well provided that A is still \u001c \u0393. In fact, this conclusion is not restricted to\nthe ZD case but is valid generally: some evidence in support of it was contained earlier\nin [95] (see Fig. 54 above, reproducing Fig. 1 from [95]). But, in the ZD case, the ampli-\ntude of the oscillations of |\u03c7\u02dc(+)| \u2212 |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2212)| may be larger. Indeed, this amplitude is equal to\nthe doubled contribution from the time range near tns in the ns harmonic, 2|\u03c7\u02dcns|, while\na similar contribution in the non-ZD case dominates in \u03c7\u02dc. Thus the difference between\n|\u03c7\u02dc(+)| and |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2212)|, which arises because of the different results of interference with the next\n(by absolute value) contribution, is obviously smaller than 2|\u03c7\u02dcns |.\nThe strong interference between the 2nd ZDP harmonic and the fundamental, and between\nthe 3rd ZDP harmonic and the fundamental, are well seen 55 in Fig. 60. The alternation\nof the sign of |\u03c7\u02dc(+)| \u2212 |\u03c7\u02dc(\u2212)| (as \u2126 or \u0393 vary) is also obvious from Fig. 60.\n5.3.3.3 Underdamped limit.\nConsider first the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0. Similarly to the conventional case, the decrease\nof activation energy caused by the resonant mechanism as A increases, or \u0393 decreases, may\nbe expected to saturate at A \u223c \u0393: Eq. (5.3.17) is valid in the ZD case too if we exchange\nEN for Ee. However the characteristic width \u2206Er of the energy band which makes the\nmajor contribution to the resonant mechanism is larger than in the conventional case: as\nin all zero-dispersion phenomena, the resonance covers a broader band of energies than\nin the conventional case. More concretely, \u2206Er is larger due to the time tr during which\nQ\u02d9(t) stays in resonance with the relevant harmonic of the periodic driving force, i.e. the\ntime during which the argument of the cosine in the integral in (5.3.28) has an absolute\nvalue\n\u223c\n< pi, is larger: tr \u223c (\u2206\u2126(ZD)N )\u22121 \u221d \u0393\u22122\/3. Correspondingly,\n\u2206Er \u223c \u0393\u2126mI(Ee)tr \u221d \u03931\/3. (5.3.29)\nThe width of the nonlinear resonance \u2206Enr which comes into play as \u0393\/A\u2192 0, is of the\nsame order of magnitude as \u2206Er (5.3.29) at the onset of saturation (i.e. at \u0393 \u223c A): cf.\n[67,68], or Sec. 4.1 above. Thus, in the asymptotic limit A\u2192 0, the maximal decrease in\nactivation energy as \u0393 varies is larger than in the conventional case: (\u2212\u03b4Sa)max \u223c \u2206Enr \u223c\n\u2206Er(\u0393 \u223c A) \u221d A1\/3 (cf. the conventional case, where it is \u221d A1\/2).\nThe most important difference between the ZD and conventional cases is manifested in\nthe range of moderately weak damping. Unlike the conventional case, the variation of\neigenfrequency over a broad band of energies far from the bottom may be very small: cf.\nFig. 61. Correspondingly, the energy width of a nonlinear resonance may be very large\n(it may be comparable with the barrier height) while the linear response still exists.\nMoreover, if the driving frequency is close to the relevant extremal eigenfrequency \u2126m,\nthen the relevant layer of transient chaos goes down very deep into the well while the\n55 The interference between the 1st ZDP harmonic and the fundamental are seen only in Fig.\n60(a) while, at smaller values of \u0393 which relate to the figures (b) and (c), the range of energies\nclose to Ee is the only range which contributes to the frequency range close to \u2126m so that the\nZDP contribution has nothing to interfere with.\n92\ndriving amplitude is still quite small. This is attributable to the reconnection between\nthe chaotic layer around the original separatrix and the layers around separatrices of the\nnonlinear resonances (cf. Sec. 4.3.2 above). Altogether, the mixed mechanisms of nonlinear\nresonance and the chaotic layer give rise to a very significant reduction of the activation\nenergy even for rather weak driving. Let us now examine this in more detail.\nConsider first the evolution of the layer of transient chaos as A increases. Generalizing\nthe derivation of the asymptotic expression for \u00b5l (5.3.14) related to the Duffing oscillator\n[60], one can derive the following formula for the critical value A\/\u0393 at which a homoclinic\ntangle arises in an arbitrary potential system perturbed by a linear friction and sinusoidal\nforce,\n\u00b5l \u2261\n(\nA\n\u0393\n)\nc\n=\n2\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dt q\u02d9\n2\ns(t)\u221a(\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dt q\u02d9s(t) cos(\u2126t)\n)2\n+\n(\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dt q\u02d9s(t) sin(\u2126t)\n)2 , (5.3.30)\nwhere q\u02d9s(t) is the velocity on the separatrix for unperturbed motion in the potential, i.e.\nwithout friction or periodic driving; the origin of time axis t may be chosen arbitrarily.\nFor the periodic potential drawn in Fig. 61(a), the dependence \u00b5l(\u2126) (5.3.30) is shown\nin Fig. 62. Though it possesses distinct differences from the case of the Duffing oscillator\n(unlike the latter case, \u00b5l(\u2126) for a periodic potential does not diverge as \u2126 \u2192 0), its\nmajor property in the present context remains the same: \u00b5l(\u2126) \u223c 1 in the relevant range\n\u2126 \u223c \u2126m \u223c \u03c90.\nThough the onset of the homoclinic tangle is not related to the ZD property, its further\nevolution, as the driving amplitude increases, possesses in a ZD system a remarkable\nfeature that is not typical of a conventional system: the reconnection between the chaotic\nlayer around the barrier level with the layers around the separatrices of the ZDNRs\nstarts at a very small driving amplitude provided that \u2126 \u2248 \u2126m (cf. Sec. 4.3.2 above).\nIt causes a drastic lowering of the minimal energy in the layer of transient chaos which\nprovides transport beyond the barriers. Fig. 63 clearly demonstrates this feature for the ZD\nsystem shown in Fig. 61: if the driving frequency is far from the extremal eigenfrequency\n\u2126m \u2248 0.658 and its harmonics, then a significant decrease in activation energy (for a\nvalue \u223c \u2206U) requires a relatively large driving amplitude, A \u223c 0.1; whereas, if \u2126 is only\nslightly smaller than \u2126m, then such a decrease occurs in a jump-wise manner at a much\nsmaller amplitude, A = 0.005.\nBut, as discussed in the last paragraph of item (2) of Sec. 5.3.2.1 above, the jumps in Em\ndo not result in jumps of either \u03b4Sa or even of Eex. On the other hand, the value of A\nat which the jump in Ub \u2212 E(nd)m (or in Ub \u2212 Em if \u0393 is not small enough) occurs due to\nthe reconnection with the major ZDNRs indicates the range of A in which the growth of\n\u2212\u03b4Sa(A) saturates or significantly slows. The value of Ub\u2212E(nd)m after the jump indicates\nthe order of magnitude of \u2212\u03b4Sa(A) in the range of A where its growth is saturated. These\nqualitative conclusions are in a good agreement with the results of simulations, presented\nin Fig. 64. We stress also that, despite the equality (in the relevant range of A) of the\nactivation energies for escape to the left and to the right, the prefactors are still different\ndue to the asymmetry of noise-free transport in the chaotic layer (cf. [131]), so that the\ndirected diffusion is still present and, obviously, the significant decrease of the activation\n93\nenergy results in a drastic increase of the net flux.\n5.3.4 Conclusions and unsolved problems\nThus, the initial work [119] has shown immediately that the decrease in activation energy\ncaused by periodic driving is strongest in ZD systems. The effect is especially pronounced\nif the driving frequency is close to the relevant extreme eigenfrequency while the driv-\ning is moderately weak: the major nonlinear resonances (ZDNRs) are then very wide in\nenergy and, in addition, chaotic layers associated with their separatrices reconnect the\nchaotic layer associated with the barrier level. Consequently, the activation energy may\nbe substantially reduced, even by periodic driving that is relatively weak.\nBut there obviously remain many interesting unsolved problems and barely studied issues.\nWe mention, in particular that \u2013\n(1) Given that the largest decrease of the activation energy under the action of periodic\ndriving occurs in strongly underdamped ZD systems, the most important task is to\ncreate a theoretical method to describe \u03b4Sa quantitatively for the ZD case in the\nunderdamped limit. Given that the major contribution comes from the energy range\nof the major ZDNRs, where the variation of eigenfrequency is small, we hope it may\nbe possible to introduce a proper pair of slow variables (e.g. slow action\u2013slow angle)\nand to use the method of optimal fluctuations in the plane of these variables.\n(2) It is a challenging problem to create a quantitative theory for the range \u0393 \u223c A,\nwhere neither of the approximations described above can be used for a quantitative\ndescription. At present, we cannot even suggest an approach to the solution of this\nproblem.\n(3) Explicit formulae that would estimate quantitatively the overlap of the ZDNRs with\nthe chaotic layer associated with the barrier level are desirable. They would allow\none to estimate even more easily the value of A at which the growth of \u2212\u03b4Sa with A\nsaturates, as well as the order of magnitude of the, in a sense, optimal driving ampli-\ntude. They would also allow one to calculate more accurately the optimal difference\nbetween the driving frequency and the extremal eigenfrequency, and to estimate the\ncorresponding decrease in activation energy.\n(4) A theoretical evaluation of the prefactor in the escape rate is obviously important,\nbut this problem appears to be a very difficult one.\n(5) It is certainly necessary to undertake more detailed experimental studies, in a wide\nrange of systems and driving force parameters, both for the escape rate and for\ndirected diffusion. This seems to be especially important, given that a quantitative\ntheoretical description exists so far only for some of the regimes.\n(6) It would be interesting to study characteristic features of escape and directed diffusion\nunder periodic driving in periodic potentials that have more than one barrier within\nthe period (cf. various related aspects in [138] and in subsubsection 4.3.2). These\nnearly always possess the ZD property: cf. subsections 2.1 and 2.2.\n94\n5.4 Weak noise: noise-induced escapes from nonlinear resonances\nWe now consider noise-induced escape from nonlinear resonances, i.e. from metastable\nstates generated by the periodic driving itself; note the distinction from the previous sub-\nsection 5.3, where we considered the influence of periodic driving on noise-induced escape\nfrom a metastable potential well that exists independently of the driving. Provided the\ndriving force is weak, slow motion within the nonlinear resonance reduces to the motion\nof the auxiliary autonomous Hamiltonian system (see Sec. 4). Similarly, the original es-\ncape problem in the non-autonomous system also reduces to the escape problem in the\nautonomous one. The most interesting case arises when more than one nonlinear reso-\nnance is involved, which is precisely the situation for ZDNR. In contrast to motion in a\nmulti-well potential, subject to linear friction and white noise, where the escape problem\nhas been well understood and a unique solution can be rigorously found [133,138], the\npossibilities for finding a rigorous solution in the search for the most probable escape path\nfrom a non-potential multi-basin state are much more limited. The work [139] presents\na profound study of caustics, cusps and other singularities encountered by the flow of\noptimal paths. However, the conclusions of [139] are not directly applicable to the present\nproblem of an escape to beyond the boundary of a multi-basin state. So, we hope that,\napart from applications to the particular model investigated by us, our initial numerical\nresults [78] may stimulate an extension of the general analysis carried out in [139].\nThe sub-section is arranged in the following way. Sec. 5.4.1 presents the reduction of the\noriginal non-autonomous stochastic equations to the corresponding autonomous ones for\nslow variables, and it describes the method of optimal fluctuation in application to this\nproblem. Sec. 5.4.2 provides numerical results for the most probable escape path in the\ncase of the TDO, taken as a typical example of a ZD system, and compares them with\nthe results of simulations. Concluding remarks and a discussion of unsolved problems are\ngiven in Sec. 5.4.3.\n5.4.1 Fluctuational transitions in a ZD oscillator driven by a quasi-periodic force with\nfluctuating angle\nAs described above in Sec. 4, a nonlinear oscillator subject to a periodic force generally\npossesses nonlinear resonances, i.e. stable states generated by the periodic force itself; in\nthe case of a ZD oscillator, slow motion within these resonances is essentially different\nfrom that of a conventional oscillator. If, in addition, the system is perturbed by weak\nnoise, the states generated by the periodic force become metastable: escape may then\noccur under the influence of the noise. The most general features of such an escape are\nqualitatively similar for any type of noise. However, it is easiest to study them for the case\nwhen noise is applied to the angle of the driving force 56 rather than being additive as in\nthe previous sub-sections 5.1\u20135.3. Apart from being convenient for theoretical studies in\nthe present context, a fluctuating angle is typical of the fields generated by a variety of\nreal sources including e.g. lasers and electromagnetic generators [141].\n56 The escape problem in the presence of such noise was studied in [140] for the case of a\nconventional (i.e. non-ZD) weakly nonlinear oscillator.\n95\nThus, we shall consider the following model:\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 + dU\/dq = h cos(\u03c9f t+ \u03d5(t)), (5.4.1)\n\u03d5\u02d9 = \u2212f(t),\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(0)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(t),\nwhere U \u2261 U(q) is the potential of a ZD oscillator, i.e. the eigenfrequency \u03c9 possesses one\nor more extrema as a function of energy (or, correspondingly, as a function of action).\nThis model differs from those considered in Sec. 4 (cf. for example Eq. (4.2.3)) through\nthe presence of the noise term in the equation for the angle, namely the instantaneous\nfrequency of the sinusoidal driving force is subject to white noise. Similarly to the noise-\nfree case, we may separate the slow and fast variables, so that the dynamics of the slow\nvariables of the oscillator, the action I and the slow angle \u03c8\u02dc \u2261 \u03c8\u2212\u03c9f t\u2212\u03d5(t), are described\nby the following equations\nI\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n\u2212 \u0393I, \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 = \u2202H\n\u2202I\n+ f(t), (5.4.2)\nH \u2261 H(I, \u03c8\u02dc) =\nI\u222b\n0\ndI\u02dc (\u03c9(I\u02dc)\u2212 \u03c9f )\u2212 hq1(I) cos(\u03c8\u02dc),\nwhich differ from (4.2.4) only through the noise term in the equation for \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8. It causes the\nstable states of the noise-free system (the most relevant of which correspond to nonlinear\nresonances of the original system) to become metastable.\nAs in the problem of field-enhanced escape from a potential well, considered above in sub-\nsection 5.3, we shall consider here only the exponential factors in the escape probabilities.\nWe shall again use the method of optimal fluctuation (for complementary reviews of its\nvarious modifications, see [132,54]) but in a variant that differs slightly from the one used\nin sub-section 5.3.\nThe method of optimal fluctuation makes use of the fact that the probability density\nfunctional P[f ], characterizing the probabilities of different realizations of the random\nforce f(t), depends on noise intensity D in an activation-like manner:\nP[f ] = exp\n(\n\u2212S[f ]\nD\n)\n, (5.4.3)\nwhere the functional S does not depend on D. In the particular case of white noise, the\nfunctional S[f ] is of the following form [142]\nS[f ] =\n1\n4\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ndtf 2(t). (5.4.4)\n96\nThe escape probability is the path integral [142] over all trajectories starting in the at-\ntractor and ending on the relevant boundary (e.g. the boundary of its basin of attraction),\ntaken with the statistical weight (5.4.3)-(5.4.4):\nW =\n\u222b\nD\u02dcf(t)e\u2212\nS[f ]\nD . (5.4.5)\nBecause of the smallness of D, the functional P[f ] is very sharp, so that\nW = Fpre(D)e\n\u2212Smin\nD , (5.4.6)\nwhere the so called prefactor Fpre depends on D relatively weakly (typically as a power\nlaw), while the major dependence is determined by the exponential (activation) factor. The\nso called activation energy Smin is the minimum of S[f ] over all relevant trajectories and\nover the time t. Given that the dynamical variables are related to f(t) via the equations\nof motion (Eqs. (5.4.2) in our case), the minimization of S[f ] may be formulated as\na variational problem [134]: cf. for example sub-section 5.3 above. However, unlike the\npotential case \u2013 where f(t) may easily be expressed from the equations of motion via the\ngeneralized coordinate and its first and second time derivatives, so that one may seek\nthe absolute minimum of the corresponding functional (cf. Eq. (5.3.2)) \u2013 the dynamical\nvariable \u03c8\u02dc in the present case is expressed in terms of the conjugated variable I, and its\nderivative I\u02d9, in a rather complicated manner. Correspondingly, the Euler equation turns\nout very complicated and inconvenient for numerical analysis. An alternative approach is\nto formulate the minimization problem as a conditional one [134]. Namely, it follows from\n(5.4.2), (5.4.4)-(5.4.6) that\nSmin = min[I(\u03c4),\u03c8\u02dc(\u03c4)],tS, S =\nt\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4 L(I, \u03c8\u02dc, \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8), (5.4.7)\nL =\n1\n4\n( \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202H\n\u2202I\n)2 =\n1\n4\n( \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 + \u03c9f \u2212 \u03c9(I) + hdq1\ndI\ncos(\u03c8\u02dc))2,\nwith the additional condition, following from the first equation in (5.4.2),\nI\u02d9 +\n\u2202H(I, \u03c8\u02dc)\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n+ \u0393I = 0. (5.4.8)\nThe most probable escape path (MPEP) [I(\u03c4), \u03c8\u02dc(\u03c4)] should satisfy the following initial\nconditions 57 ,\nI(0) \u2248 If , \u03c8\u02dc(0) \u2248 \u03c8\u02dcf , (5.4.9)\n57 We use in (5.4.9) the notation \u201c\u2248\u201d instead of the exact equality because, in reality, the MPEP\nmay emerge from the focus itself infinitely slowly. Thus, in real calculations, one should slightly\nshift the starting point of the MPEP.\n97\nwhere the subscript f denotes the relevant focus of the system (5.4.2) in the absence of\nnoise (f(t) = 0).\nThe condition for an ending point of the MPEP may vary. Typically, one solves the\nproblem of escape to beyond some boundary 58 , so that S should be minimized over the\nposition of the ending point on the boundary. Such a minimization can often be done\nexplicitly: see Sec. 5.4.2 below.\nThe necessary condition for the minimum over time is:\n\u2202S\n\u2202t\n= 0. (5.4.10)\nThe minimization over a path (with a given t) with an additional condition may be\nformulated as the variational problem for an absolute minimum, by the introduction of\nan additional auxiliary function \u03bb(t) (sometimes called an \u201cindefinite multiplier\u201d) [134].\nOne therefore has to seek the absolute minimum for the auxiliary functional\nS\u02dc =\nt\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4 L\u02dc(I, \u03c8\u02dc, \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8), (5.4.11)\nL\u02dc = L+ \u03bb(\u03c4)(I\u02d9 +\n\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n+ \u0393I),\nwhere the auxiliary Lagrangian function L\u02dc differs from the original function L (5.4.7)\nthrough the product of an unknown auxiliary function \u03bb(\u03c4) and the left-hand side of\nthe Eq. (5.4.8). The MPEP [I(\u03c4), \u03c8\u02dc(\u03c4)] and the auxiliary function \u03bb(\u03c4) may be found\nfrom the corresponding Euler equations together with the condition (5.4.8). We use an\nalternative Hamiltonian method, however, in close analogy with [140]. As is well known\nfrom mechanics [1], an alternative way to describe the dynamics of a system governed\nby the minimum principle is to use Hamiltonian equations: for more than one degree of\nfreedom, the Hamiltonian method is often more convenient than the Lagrangian (Euler)\none. With this aim, one has to introduce the Hamiltonian function H\u02dc(pi, xi), which is\nwritten in terms of generalized coordinates xi and momenta pi [1]:\npi =\n\u2202L\u02dc\n\u2202x\u02d9i\n, (5.4.12)\nH\u02dc =\n\u2211\ni\nx\u02d9i\n\u2202L\u02dc\n\u2202x\u02d9i\n\u2212 L\u02dc,\nwhere the velocities x\u02d9i in the second equation in (5.4.12) are assumed to be expressed via\nthe sets of coordinates {xj} and momenta {pj} from the first equation in (5.4.12).\n58 In mathematical literature, it is often called the first-passge problem.\n98\nIn the case of the Lagrangian L\u02dc (5.4.11), the generalized coordinates are I and \u03c8\u02dc. After\nsubstituting L\u02dc (5.4.11) into (5.4.12), we end up with a Hamiltonian which does not depend\nexplicitly on \u03bb:\nH\u02dc \u2261 H\u02dc(I, \u03c8\u02dc, pI , p\u03c8\u02dc) = p2\u03c8\u02dc + p\u03c8\u02dc\n\u2202H\n\u2202I\n\u2212 pI(\u2202H\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n+ \u0393I), (5.4.13)\nwhere H \u2261 H(I, \u03c8\u02dc) is given in (5.4.2).\nThe condition (5.4.10) can be shown (cf. e.g. [138,140]) to be equivalent to\nH\u02dc(I, \u03c8\u02dc, pI , p\u03c8\u02dc) = 0. (5.4.14)\nThus, the problem of the MPEP reduces to the solution of the Hamiltonian equations\np\u02d9I = \u2212\u2202H\u02dc\/\u2202I, p\u02d9\u03c8\u02dc = \u2212\u2202H\u02dc\/\u2202\u03c8\u02dc, I\u02d9 = \u2202H\u02dc\/\u2202pI , \u02d9\u02dc\u03c8 = \u2202H\u02dc\/\u2202p\u03c8\u02dc, (5.4.15)\non the zero-H\u02dc surface (5.4.14) while I and \u03c8\u02dc at the beginning and end of the MPEP lie\nrespectively at the focus and at the proper state on the relevant boundary.\nGenerally, such an MPEP and the action S (5.4.7) along it, which constitutes the ac-\ntivation energy Smin, should be found numerically by a shooting method\n59 . A major\ndifficulty which may arise in a numerical search for Smin is that there are typically many,\noften infinitely many, extremals i.e. solutions of the Hamiltonian equations lying on the\nzero-H\u02dc surface and providing for the connection between given states in the I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane.\nCorrespondingly, there are many values of the shooting parameter which provide for an\nextremal. So far, unfortunately, there are no rigorous rules in the non-potential case 60\nthat would allow one to single out the range of the shooting parameter in which lies only\none value corresponding to an extremal, namely to that extremal whose projection onto\nthe I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane provides the absolute minimum of action. At the same time, there are\nsome rigorous rules which significantly reduce the number of extremals whose projections\nmay pretend to be the MPEP, or may even provide for the unique choice. Examples will\nbe presented in Sec. 5.4.2 below.\n59 Two of the initial conditions required for the four differential equations (5.4.15) are fixed by\nthe conditions (5.4.9) (note however footnote 57). If one of the other initial conditions can be\ndetermined, then the remaining initial condition will also be fixed due to the condition (5.4.14).\nIntegrating equations (5.4.15), one should check whether the projection of the trajectory onto\nthe I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane passes (at any time) close to the given final state. Typically one does not fix\na time of integration. Rather the equations are integrated until the projection of the trajectory\neither reaches a close vicinity of the given final state or, on the contrary, goes far away from the\nrelevant region. Thus there is only one parameter (any combination of the initial conditions)\nthat needs to be matched. Usually, it is possible to choose this parameter as some angle whose\nfull range of variation is 2pi. So, one needs to try a large number of values from this range. Their\nchoice is, in a sense, arbitrary: they are effectively \u201cshot\u201d, whence the terminology of shooting\nmethod and shooting parameter respectively.\n60 For the potential case, such rules have been derived in [138].\n99\nIf the damping parameter \u0393 is sufficiently small that, not only is the original motion (5.4.1)\nunderdamped, but even the motion of the averaged system (5.4.2) is underdamped, then\nthe activation energy may be found explicitly by a different method, using the averaged\nFokker-Plank equation. So also can the prefactor (cf. the case of a non-ZD weakly nonlinear\noscillator [140]). However, an explicit calculation of this kind for the present (ZD) case\nhas not yet been achieved. In the next sub-section we concentrate instead on the case\nof a basin of attraction with two saddles, inner and outer, a situation that is of greatest\ninterest when the slow motion is not underdamped.\n5.4.2 Numerical calculations and simulations for the case of the tilted Duffing oscillator\nAs an example of a periodically driven weakly dissipative ZD system, we shall again use\nthe tilted Duffing oscillator (TDO) driven by a sinusoidal force and subject to linear\nfriction, with parameters as in Fig. 21(b). As can be seen from this figure, the basin of\nattraction of one of the nonlinear resonances is encompassed by the basin of the other\nresonance. We shall be interested in two kinds of escape, which we consider in turn \u2013\n(a) Escape from a single basin of attraction and transition to a neighbouring attractor.\nThe activation energy related to the transition from an attractor to its neighbouring\nattractor is equal to that related to the escape beyond the boundary dividing their\nbasins of attraction. Indeed, as soon as the system reaches the boundary, the further\ntransition to the neighbouring attractor can follow a noise-free trajectory towards it, so\nthat S (5.4.4) is not being increased any more. We shall consider further only MPEPs\nbeyond boundaries of basins of attraction, while bearing in mind that they constitute\nthe activation energies both for the escapes and for the transitions between the corre-\nsponding attractors.\nIt can be shown [129] that the action S, as a function of the ending state on the\nboundary of the basin of attraction, decreases as the ending state moves towards the\nsaddle, reaching its minimum on the saddle itself. In the case of a single basin, the\nsaddle is for certain reachable for the flow of optimal paths since the caustic emanates\njust from the saddle [139]. Thus the MPEP from a single basin of attraction ends on\nthe saddle of the basin (in real calculations, one should slightly shift it from the very\nsaddle since the latter is approached by the MPEP infinitely slowly [139]):\nI(t) \u2248 Is, \u03c8\u02dc(t) \u2248 \u03c8\u02dcs. (5.4.16)\nFig. 65 shows the corresponding MPEPs [f1 \u2192 s1], [f2 \u2192 s1],[f2 \u2192 s2], calculated\nby means of Eqs. (5.4.13)-(5.4.15) with the corresponding initial and final conditions\n(5.4.9), (5.4.16). The activation energy Smin (5.4.7) along the MPEPs is equal respec-\ntively\nS\n(12)\nmin \u2248 0.00293, S(21)min \u2248 0.0118, S(23)min \u2248 0.01. (5.4.17)\nIt is worth pointing out that the activation energies differ from the difference between\nthe values of the resonance\u2019s Hamiltonian H at the corresponding saddle and focus:\nfor example, H(Is1 , \u03c8\u02dcs1)\u2212H(If1 , \u03c8\u02dcf1) \u2248 0.0021, which clearly differs from S(12)min . This is\n100\nin contrast to the case of a Hamiltonian of the potential type 61 , where the activation\nenergy is simply equal to the height of the potential barrier (i.e. to the difference between\nthe corresponding values of the Hamiltonian).\n(b) Escape from the nonlinear resonance area as a whole and direct transition from the\ninner nonlinear resonance to the linear response attractor.\nMathematical aspects of the problem of noise-induced escapes\/transitions in multi-\nattractor systems have been considered in the monograph [132]. The most important\nresult in the present context is that, if the noise is sufficiently weak, then the dynamics\nof inter-attractor transitions may be described on exponentially long time-scales by\nsimple kinetic equations with constant inter-attractor rates \u03b1ij \u221d exp(\u2212S(ij)min\/D). If\none restricts oneself to the evaluation of exponential factors only, one may equivalently\nconsider the problem with an absorbing boundary around the basin of attraction of\nthe final attractor. A detailed analysis of the flux dynamics in a 3-state system with an\nabsorbing 3rd state is presented in [138]. Let us denote the basins of attraction of f1 and\nf2 in our system as states 1 and 2 respectively, and let the former basin be encompassed\nby the latter. The remaining phase space may be denoted as 3. The activation energies\nS\n(13)\nmin and S\n(23)\nmin in such a formal problem with an absorbing state 3 (\u201cfirst-passage\u201d\nproblem) are equal to those for the inter-attractor transitions respectively from the\nthe nonlinear resonances f1 and f2 towards the linear response, because the noise-\nfree trajectory that exits through the boundary of the (1 + 2)-area reaches just the\nlinear response attractor. We shall consider further only the first-passage problem, while\nbearing in mind its direct relation to the problem of inter-attractor transitions.\nConsider, for example, the case when the system stays initially in 1. Typically, and\nin particular for the parameters considered here, the time ts for the formation of quasi-\nequilibrium within the nonlinear resonance area as the whole (1 + 2) is much shorter\nthan the average time tqs over which the area 1 + 2 is depleted; the latter may be\nconsidered as the lifetime within the nonlinear resonance area 1+2. Then, after a short\ninitial interval tin of the order of the relaxation time during which quasi-equilibrium is\nestablished in the initial state, the dynamics of the flux into 3 is described [138] (cf. also\n[143] where the theory is illustrated by simulations in an example potential system) by\nJ(t) \u2261 J13(t) \u2248 \u03b113e\u2212\nt\nts +\n1\ntqs\n(e\n\u2212 t\ntqs \u2212 e\u2212 tts ), (5.4.18)\nts \u001c tqs, t\u001d tin,\nThe time-scales ts and tqs can be expressed via the \u03b1ij, and both are exponentially\nlonger than tin provided that the noise intensity is small: for example, for the system\nshown in Fig. 65, the relations \u03b113 \u001c \u03b112 and \u03b121 \u001c \u03b123 \u001c \u03b112 are satisfied, so that\n[138] ts \u2248 \u03b1\u2212112 and tqs \u2248 \u03b1\u2212123 . The first term in the expression (5.4.18) for the flux is\ndetermined by the direct transitions 1 \u2192 3, while the second term is due to indirect\ntransitions i.e. those that involve attractor 2 as an intermediate state. It follows from\n(5.4.18) that, at relatively small times t < ts ln(tqs\/ts), the flux is entirely due to\ndirect transitions, J(t) \u2248 \u03b113 exp(\u2212t\/ts); in particular, J \u2248 \u03b113 if t \u001c ts. For times\nt > ts ln(tqs\/ts), indirect transitions prevail and the flux becomes quasi-stationary,\nJ(t) \u2248 t\u22121qs exp(\u2212t\/tqs); in particular, J \u2248 t\u22121qs if ts ln(tqs\/ts) < t\u001c tqs.\n61 Where the friction and noise are assumed to be linear and white respectively, both entering\nonly the equation for the generalized momentum.\n101\nWe emphasize that, as the noise intensity decreases, the time-scale ts becomes ex-\nponentially long, so that the quasi-stationary stage becomes unattainable in practice\nwhile J \u2248 \u03b113 over the major part of the attainable time-scale. Thus, it is important to\nknow the rates \u03b1ij, of which \u03b113 for the direct transition 1\u2192 3 is especially important.\nThe technique described in the previous sub-section, 5.4.1, facilitates calculation of\nthe activation energies S\n(ij)\nmin related to \u03b1ij. It allows us: (i) to determine strong in-\nequalities between the \u03b1ij \u221d exp(\u2212S(ij)min\/D), which in turn determine many important\nproperties of the flux dynamics [138]; and (ii) to determine the major dependence of\nthe flux on noise intensity, which is often quite sufficient for practical purposes.\nFor the set of parameters corresponding to Fig. 65, the activation energies related to\n\u03b112, \u03b121 and \u03b123 are given in Eq. (5.4.17) above. The rest of this sub-section will be\ndevoted to the direct transition 1 \u2192 3, i.e. to the search of the corresponding MPEP\nand S\n(13)\nmin .\nIt can be shown by a standard method [134] that the MPEP should either be a\nprojection onto the plane I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc of a smooth solution of Eqs. (5.4.13)-(5.4.15), or a\ncombination of the projections of two smooth solutions for which a saddle (a singularity\npoint for projections of the smooth solutions) provides the end point of one solution\nand the starting point of the other one. It should be emphasized that, for the escape\n1 \u2192 3, the former option may be realized in contrast to the potential case, where\nthe MPEP from the inner attractor to a state lying beyond its basin of attraction\nnecessarily follows the saddle of an inner basin of attraction [133,138,143]. Even without\nthe concrete calculations [138], this latter property of the MPEP in multi-well potential\nsystems can easily be proved using the property of detailed balance, which holds in the\npotential systems [38]. Indeed, let us prove this by reductio ad absurdam. Suppose that\nthe MPEP [f1 \u2192 b], where b is a state beyond the basin of attraction of f1, does not\npass through the saddle s1. Then, on account of detailed balance, the MPEP [b \u2192 f1]\nis the time-reversal of the MPEP [f1 \u2192 b] and therefore it should not pass through s1\neither, i.e. it should cross the boundary of the basin of attraction of f1 at some point\np1 which differs from s1. On the other hand, as soon as the system reaches the basin\nof attraction of f1, it then most probably relaxes to f1, independent of noise. But the\nnoise-free trajectory from p1, which belongs to the boundary of the basin of attraction,\nfirst relaxes to s1 and only from there to f1. This contradicts the initial assumption,\nthereby proving that the saddle s1 is necessarily followed by the MPEP [f1 \u2192 b].\nIn non-potential systems, detailed balance generally does not hold \u2013 so proofs like\nthat in the previous paragraph are invalid. On the other hand, we have not met in the\nliterature any example of such avoidance of an inner saddle by an MPEP 62 , and one\nof the incentives for the work [78] was the hope of finding evidence of such saddle point\navoidance. However, none has yet been found: though the projections of the smooth\nsolutions do typically avoid the inner saddle s1 (see the lower inset in Fig. 65), the\nMPEP is realized by means of the alternative option (i.e. it follows s1), at least for\nthe present set of parameters (Fig. 65). Given that the search for the MPEP in a non-\n62 This should be resolved from a series of works (see [144] and references therein) on the exit\nlocation distribution from a single-basin. In the latter case, deviations of the exit point from the\nsaddle are small in the sense that they go to zero as the noise intensity goes to zero. In contrast,\nin the present case, the deviation of the exit point on the boundary of the inner basin from the\ninner saddle is assumed to be non-zero, however small the noise intensity.\n102\npotential system is far from trivial, we present below a more detailed description and\ndiscussion of our numerical results.\nConsider first the projection of the flow of such smooth solutions of (5.4.13)-(5.4.15)\nwhose projections emanate from f1 while ending on the outer boundary (OB) of the\nbasin of attraction of f2. It turns out that a projection of any solution of such a kind\nhits the OB at some finite distance from s2 (i.e. the projection of the flow of the smooth\nsolutions encounters caustics which leaves the saddle s2 beyond them). It can be shown\n(cf. [129]) that, the closer the end point on a basin boundary is to its saddle, the smaller\nthe action along the projection of the smooth solution. Hence, we may keep as pretenders\nto being the MPEP only the two \u201cedge\u201d paths (i.e. those whose end points are as close\nto s2 as possible, from the left and from the right respectively). These paths are shown in\nthe lower inset in Fig. 65. However, even without an explicit calculation of actions, it is\nobvious from the figure itself that neither of these paths can be the MPEP, e.g. because\nboth of them intersect the noise-free path [s1 \u2192 f2] while any path intersecting the\nnoise-free path cannot provide a minimal action for a transition 1\u2192 3 . Indeed, if such\nan intersection occurs in some state i, then one may construct a path that necessarily\npossesses an action smaller than that along the path [f1 \u2192 OB]: the auxiliary path with\na smaller action may be put together from (i) [f1 \u2192 s1], (ii) the noise-free path from s1\ntill the intersection i with the path [f1 \u2192 OB] and, (iii) the remaining part of the latter\npath i.e. [i\u2192 OB]. Given that [f1 \u2192 s1] provides minimal action for the transition from\nthe inner attractor (i.e. f1) to the boundary of its attraction, part (i) of the auxiliary\npath provides a smaller action than that along the segment [f1 \u2192 OB] between f1\nand its intersection with the inner boundary; part (ii) contributes zero action, which\nmust obviously be smaller than the action along the segment [f1 \u2192 OB] between the\nintersection with the inner boundary and the state i; finally, part (iii) merely coincides\nwith the remaining part of the path [f1 \u2192 OB]. Similarly, it can be shown that a path\n[f1 \u2192 OB] intersecting the outer MPEP [f2 \u2192 s2] cannot provide the minimal action\neither. Similar considerations apply to selfintersecting paths.\nThus, the MPEP for the transition 1 \u2192 3 should be constructed from the inner\nMPEP [f1 \u2192 s1] and the projection of a smooth solution of Eqs. (5.4.13)-(5.4.15)\nsuch that its projection starts on s1 and ends on the OB as close to the saddle s2\nas possible, while avoiding selfintersections and intersections with the noise-free path\n[s1 \u2192 f2] or with the outer MPEP [f2 \u2192 s2]. We have found only one path satisfying\nall these requirements 63 (see Fig. 65): it joins smoothly onto [s1 \u2192 f2] and [f2 \u2192 s2],\nanalogously to the potential case [138,143]. This path must be the MPEP. The action\nalong it, i.e. the activation energy related to \u03b113,\nS\n(13)\nmin \u2248 0.007, (5.4.19)\nis smaller than action along either of the smooth edge paths (0.173 and 0.0376 for the\nleft and right path respectively).\nThe upper inset in Fig. 65 presents a few paths [f1 \u2192 OB] simulated sequentially\n(rather than artificially selected from a larger group of simulated paths [f1 \u2192 OB]) by\ncomputer for the noise intensity D=0.0007. They nicely concentrate near the MPEP\nfound theoretically above. Some small regular deviations from the inner and outer\n63 Note that there are many (probably, infinitely many) solutions of Eqs. (5.4.13)-(5.4.15) whose\nprojections connect s1 to s2.\n103\nsaddles are due to the diffusion [144] and they vanish as D \u2192 0.\n5.4.3 Concluding remarks and unsolved problems\nWe have reviewed the initial studies [78] of noise-induced escape from ZDNRs. Similarly\nto the noise-free case, the non-autonomous system has been reduced to an autonomous\nauxiliary one. The method of optimal fluctuation has been applied to the escape problem\nin the latter system, and the activation energies and the most probable escape paths\n(MPEPs) have been studied, theoretically and by simulations, for two characteristic types\nof escape: from a single nonlinear resonance and from the ZDNR area as a whole in the\nsituation when the initial nonlinear resonance is encompassed by the other one. In the\nlatter case, the most interesting result is that, although we had reason to anticipate\navoidance of the inner saddle by the MPEP from the inner focus to the outer boundary\nof the outer basin, the MPEP does in fact pass through that saddle, after which it goes\nto the outer saddle, smoothly turning round both the noise-free trajectory from the inner\nsaddle to the outer focus and the MPEP from the outer focus to the outer saddle.\nProblems that it would be interesting to consider in the future include the following \u2013\n(1) To study escape for other sets of parameters, seeking a situation when the MPEP\nfrom the inner basin beyond the outer boundary of the outer basin is realized along a\nsmooth path, avoiding the inner saddle rather than along two smooth paths connected\nat the inner saddle.\n(2) To try to prove rigorously that there exists a unique extreme path connecting saddles\nof the multi-basin state, while avoiding selfintersections and intersections with the\nnoise-free path emanating from the inner saddle to the outer focus, and with the\nMPEP from the outer focus to the outer boundary (cf. the potential case [138,143]):\nthis would make a search of the relevant MPEP much more reliable and simple.\n(3) To extend the analysis [139] of caustics and other singularities in the flow of extreme\npaths to the case when two (rather than one) boundaries of basins of attraction are\nrelevant.\n(4) It was found in [138,143] that the activation energy for escape from the multi-basin\nstate of a potential system oscillates as the dissipation parameter varies, a phe-\nnomenon related to the occurence of saddle connections in the noise-free system\nas the parameter varies. Given that the presently used periodically driven weakly\ndissipative ZD oscillator also encounters numerous saddle connections as the driving\nfrequency or other parameters vary (see Sec. 4 above), one may expect the occurrence\nof comparable oscillations in the activation energy, in analogy with the potential case.\nIt would be interesting to study this.\n(5) To calculate explicitly both the activation energy and the prefactor for the escape\nrate in the underdamped limit, using a method similar to that of [140].\n(6) To consider characteristic features of the escape problem under additive noise (rather\nthan noise applied to angle, as above).\n(7) To carry out simulations of the original system, rather than just of the reduced one,\nwhich might reveal interesting new features that are absent in the reduced (slow)\ndynamics.\n104\n5.5 Weak noise: fluctuation spectra\nFor noise-driven systems possessing a stationary distribution, the fluctuation spectrum\nis defined above by Eq. (3.1.5). However, periodically driven systems do not possess a\nstationary distribution, so that the definition of the fluctuation spectrum of any dynamical\nquantity \u03d5 in such systems needs to be generalized (see e.g. [141,3,106]):\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) =\n1\npi\nRe\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndt exp(\u2212i\u2126t)R\u03d5(t)\n\uf8f9\uf8fb , (5.5.1)\nR\u03d5(t) \u2261 lim\n\u03c4l\u2192\u221e\n1\n2\u03c4l\n\u03c4l\u222b\n\u2212\u03c4l\nd\u03c4 \u3008(\u03d5(t+ \u03c4)\u2212 \u3008\u03d5(t+ \u03c4)\u3009)(\u03d5(\u03c4)\u2212 \u3008\u03d5(\u03c4)\u3009)\u3009,\n\u03d5(t) \u2261 \u03d5(q(t), p(t)).\nHere, \u3008\u03d5(t)\u3009 is the quantity \u03d5(t) averaged over the steady distribution in the system 64\nwhile the brackets \u3008...\u3009 in the pair correlator denote averaging both over the steady distri-\nbution at the instant \u03c4 and over realizations of the random force at the interval [\u03c4, \u03c4 + t].\nTo our knowledge, there have only been two brief studies of the fluctuation spectra of\nperiodically driven ZD systems, [77,71]. They presented the results of analogue experi-\nments and discussed them qualitatively. We now review these initial studies, providing\nrather more detail than in the original papers, and we discuss briefly some as yet unsolved\nproblems.\nWe consider the model (5.2.2) (considered in sub-section 5.2 above in a different context).\nIt can be shown [3,106] that, provided the noise is weak, the fluctuation spectrum in\nmulti-stable systems driven by noise has the following structure:\nQ = Qtr +\n\u2211\nj\nPjQj, (5.5.2)\nwhere Qtr is an exponentially narrow high peak due to noise-induced transitions between\nstable states of the noise-free system, and Qj is a relatively broad spectral contribution\nfrom small fluctuations about the j-th stable state while Pj is its population. A theoretical\ndescription of this kind is supported by analogue experiments: see e.g. Fig. 66 reproducing\na figure from [71].\nIt is demonstrated in Sec. 4 above that, if the driving frequency lies in the most relevant\nrange, i.e. in the vicinity of the extremal eigenfrequency or one of its harmonics, then a pe-\nriodically driven ZD system typically possesses more than one stable state. The structure\nof its spectrum of fluctuations therefore takes the form of (5.5.2). We shall demonstrate\nits characteristic features on the periodically driven TDO, as an example. Its noise-free\n64 We emphasize that the distribution is not stationary; rather it oscillates with time but the\ncharacter of the oscillations is steady.\n105\ndynamics is considered in detail in Sec. 4 above; the actual parameters used are given in\nthe caption to Fig. 21. If the driving frequency \u03c9f lies in between the minimal eigenfre-\nquency \u03c9m and the eigenfrequency \u03c90 of an oscillation in the bottom of the potential well,\nand the driving amplitude h is rather small, then there are three attractors in the system:\nsee the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 24(b). Each of them is periodic in time with the period\n2pi\/\u03c9f ; they differ in terms of their amplitude of oscillation and by the shift of the angle\nfrom that of the driving force: the attractor with the smallest amplitude corresponds to\nlinear response, whereas the two other attractors correspond to nonlinear resonances of\nthe 1st order (cf. Fig. 26). We shall also need to expand \u03d5(t) \u2261 \u03d5(q(t), p(t)) for each of\nthe attractors into Fourier series:\n\u03d5(j)(t) =\n\u2211\nn\n\u03d5(j)n exp(in\u03c9f t), (5.5.3)\ni \u2261 \u221a\u22121, \u03d5(j)\u2212n =\n(\n\u03d5(j)n\n)\u2217\n, j = 1, 2, 3.\nThus, all three states oscillate with the frequency \u03c9f and, therefore, Qtr(\u2126) is a narrow\npeak centered at \u2126 = \u03c9f . As for the spectral contributions Qj(\u2126) from small fluctuations\nabout the stable states, it is typical for only one of them to be manifested in the spec-\ntrum because the populations Pj of two other states are exponentially smaller. Only in\nexceptional cases are the populations of all three states comparable with each other, so\nthat all terms in the sum in (5.5.2) contribute significantly (cf. the middle sub-figure in\nFig. 66).\nTypically, the spectral contributions from small fluctuations about the stable states are\nwell resolved from the transition peak 65 and it is convenient to study them separately,\nwhich is done below in sub-sections 5.5.1 and 5.5.2. In sub-section 5.5.3, we briefly discuss\nsome unsolved problems.\n5.5.1 Transition peak\nA theoretical description of the transition peak in a bistable system is presented in [3]\nin a rather general context: the only limitation is that noise should be weak. The paper\n[106] studies such a peak in more detail, both theoretically and in analogue experiments,\nfor the nearly resonantly perturbed symmetric single-well Duffing oscillator. Using the\nterminology of the present review, the transition peak in [106] may be ascribed to the\ntransitions between the (conventional) nonlinear resonance and linear response.\n65 The only exception may concern the far wings of the transition peak, or even the whole peak\nif the noise is weak enough. Indeed, if oscillations about a stable state are asymmetric, which is\ntypically the case in a multi-stable system, then small fluctuations about the stable state cause\nslow fluctuations of a coordinate (or any other relevant quantity) averaged over a non-dissipative\noscillation around the stable state. The latter fluctuations result in the onset of a peak in the\nspectrum centred at \u03c9f . It dominates over the transition peak at least at the far wings of the\nlatter, or even throughout the whole frequency range if the intensity of the transition peak is\nsmall: cf. the zero-frequency peak [145,50,51] in the spectrum for a system possessing a stationary\ndistribution.\n106\nIn the case of a periodically driven zero-dispersion oscillator, the number of coexisting\nstable states may be larger than two: e.g. in the TDO used as an illustration in the\npresent sub-section, it is often three. However, when the system is subject to weak noise,\nthe hierarchy of populations of the states is typically exponentially sharp. Hence, the\ntransition peak is mostly due to transitions between the most populated state and a state\nwhich has the second largest population, while transitions involving the third state may be\nneglected since its population is negligible 66 . Thus, the description of the peak is nearly\nidentical to that in [3] and rather close to the description in [106]. We present it below in\nbrief.\nLet us denote the indices of the two most populated states by k and l. The dynamics of\ntheir populations is described by a simple kinetic equation:\ndPk\ndt\n= \u2212(Wkl +Wlk)Pk +WlkPl, (5.5.4)\nPl = 1\u2212 Pk,\nwhere Wkl and Wlk are the transition rates k \u2192 l and l \u2192 k respectively. The initial\nconditions correspond to the initially populated either kth or lth state, respectively\nPk(t = 0) = 1 or Pl(t = 0) = 1. (5.5.5)\nThe stationary solutions of Eqs. (5.5.4),(5.5.5) are\nP\n(st)\nk =\nWlk\nWkl +Wlk\n, P\n(st)\nl = 1\u2212 P(st)k . (5.5.6)\nUsing (5.5.3), (5.5.6) and solutions of (5.5.4) for each of the initial conditions (5.5.5), one\ncan obtain for the spectrum (5.5.1) (cf. [3]):\nQ\u03d5(\u2126) =\n1\npi\nWklWlk\nWkl +Wlk\n\u2211\nn\n| \u03d5(k)n \u2212 \u03d5(l)n |2\n(Wkl +Wlk)2 + (\u2126\u2212 n\u03c9f )2 . (5.5.7)\nGiven that the transition rates Wij are much smaller than \u2126, the partial peaks corre-\nsponding to different harmonics of \u03c9f practically do not overlap, so that the spectrum in\nthe close vicinity of any of the harmonics is just a Lorenzian of halfwidth\n\u2206\u2126 = Wkl +Wlk \u001c \u2126. (5.5.8)\nThe transition rates depend on the noise intensity (or, equivalently, on temperature T ) in\nan activation-like manner (see sub-section 5.4),\nWkl,lk \u221d exp(\u2212Skl,lk\/T ), (5.5.9)\n66 At exceptional sets of parameters, the populations of all three states may be comparable, but\nwe do not consider such a case here because it is, in practice, rare.\n107\nwhere Skl and Slk are the corresponding activation energies. If T \u001c Skl, Slk, then the\ntransition peaks are extremely narrow, which is why they were named [106] supernarrow\nspectral peaks.\nOne of the most important characteristics of the supernarrow peak is its intensity\nI(n)\u03d5 \u2261\nn\u2126+a\u2206\u2126\u222b\nn\u2126\u2212a\u2206\u2126\nd\u2126\u02dc Q\u03d5(\u2126\u02dc) (5.5.10)\n\u2248 WklWlk\n(Wkl +Wlk)2\n| \u03d5(k)n \u2212 \u03d5(l)n |2\u2261 P(st)k P(st)l | \u03d5(k)n \u2212 \u03d5(l)n |2,\n1\u001c a\u001c \u2126\/\u2206\u2126.\nThe factor a in the definition of I(n)\u03d5 may be chosen arbitrarily within the range indicated\nin the last line of Eq. (5.5.10).\nAllowing for the activation-like dependences (5.5.9) of the transition rates and for the\nexpressions (5.5.6) for the stationary populations, one obtains\nI(n)\u03d5 \u221d P(st)k P(st)l \u221d (2 + x+ x\u22121)\u22121, x = exp\n(\nSlk \u2212 Skl\nT\n)\n. (5.5.11)\nThe exponential x in Eq. (5.5.11) is either very small or very large, except when | Slk \u2212\nSkl |<\u223c T . Beyond the latter narrow range, the intensity of the peak may be written as\nI(n)\u03d5 \u221d exp(\u2212 | Slk \u2212 Skl | \/T ). As any parameter r (e.g. a frequency or amplitude of the\ndriving force) varies, the activation energies typically change in opposite directions i.e.\nthe derivatives \u2202Skl\/\u2202r and \u2202Slk\/\u2202r have opposite signs (cf. [106,140]). At some value of\nthe parameter which we will denote r0, Skl and Slk become equal to each other. In the\nvicinity of, but not too close to, r0\nI(n)\u03d5 \u2261 I(n)\u03d5 (r) \u221d exp (\u2212y) , (5.5.12)\ny =\n| \u2202Skl(r0)\/\u2202r0 \u2212 \u2202Slk(r0)\/\u2202r0 |\nT\n| r \u2212 r0 |, y \u001d 1.\nThus, provided T is small enough, the dependence of intensity on the parameter r is a\nsharp nearly cusp-like peak with a maximum at r = r0; it is only \u201cnearly cusp-like\u201d in that\nit is smeared at the extreme maximum. This dependence on parameters is a characteristic\nfeature of a kinetic phase transition in bistable systems [129,3,146,106], a phenomenon\nthat was predicted theoretically in [129] and observed for the first time in [146].\nUnlike the conventional case [106], when the dependence of the intensity of the transition\npeak on a parameter (e.g. the driving frequency) possesses just one peak, the analogous\ndependence in the ZD case often possesses more than one peak. This is because there may\nbe three kinetic phase transitions corresponding to repopulation between linear response\nand either one of the two nonlinear resonances, as well as between the nonlinear resonances\n108\nthemselves. For example, a two-peaked structure in such a dependence was observed in\n[77]. A detailed study of kinetic phase transitions in the ZD case and of the corresponding\ndependences of the intensities of supernarrow transition peaks on parameters has not yet\nbeen undertaken.\n5.5.2 Partial spectra due to small fluctuations about stable states.\nA detailed study of the partial spectra due to fluctuations about stable states of the\nperiodically driven ZD system has not yet been reported. At the same time, the major\ncharacteristric features of such spectra, and of their evolution as parameters vary, seem\nto have been understood [77]. We present below the qualitative and semiquantitative\narguments that provide such an understanding.\nIf the temperature is small enough, then the hierarchy of populations is typically very\nsharp so that only the state that possesses the largest activation energy is populated. If it\ncorresponds to the linear response state, then the corresponding partial spectrum is a peak\nabout the eigenfrequency in the bottom of the potential well, \u03c90 \u2261 \u03c9(E = Emin). If the\ntemperature T is extremely small (see below), then the shape of the peak is approximately\nLorenzian with a halfwidth \u223c \u0393 (cf. [106]), corresponding to eigenoscillation in the bottom\nof the well. If T increases so that | d\u03c9(E = Emin)\/dE | T >\u223c \u0393, then the peak broadens and\nits shape changes, reflecting the broadening of the spectrum of relevant eigenfrequences\n\u03c9(E) due to the growth in the energy range involved. The shapes of such broadened peaks\nhave not yet been analyzed.\nIf the most populated state is one of the nonlinear resonances, then the partial spectrum\nconsists typically of two peaks shifted from the driving frequency \u03c9f by some small value\n\u2206\u03c9 to the right and to the left respectively, so that by analogy with optics [115] they\nmay be called Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks (centered on \u03c9f + \u2206\u03c9 and \u03c9f \u2212\u2206\u03c9 respec-\ntively). Their magnitudes usually differ significantly. Furthermore, as parameters vary, so\nthat repopulation of the nonlinear resonances occurs (associated approximately with the\ncrossing of the ZDNR\/NR line), the relative magnitudes of the Stokes and anti-Stokes\npeaks are reversed. In order to understand the origins of these characteristic features, let\nus evaluate the dependence q(t) in the non-dissipative approximation.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we shall assume that the nonlinearity in the relevant resonant\nrange of energies is small, so that q as a function of action I and angle \u03c8 may be approx-\nimated just by the cosine term 67 while higher harmonics in the expansion (A.5) may be\nneglected:\nq(t) \u2248 2q1(I(t)) cos(\u03c8(t)). (5.5.13)\nIn the absence of noise, the action I(t) would relax to one of the stable stationary states,\nI(st), and the angle would change with the constant speed \u03c9f while maintaining a certain\nshift \u03c8\u02dc(st) from the angle of the driving force \u03c9f t (see sub-section 4.2):\n67 For the sake of convenience, we choose the origin of the angle \u03c8 such that q1 is real and\npositive.\n109\nI(t\u2192\u221e) \u2212\u2192 I(st), \u03c8(t\u2192\u221e) \u2212\u2192 \u03c9f t+ \u03c8\u02dc(st), (5.5.14)\nT = 0.\nIn the presence of noise, there is an approximately stationary distribution of action I in\nthe vicinity of I(st). For further analysis we assume that the dissipation is very weak, so\nthat the non-dissipative equations of motion for {I, \u03c8\u02dc} may be analyzed (i.e. \u0393 in (4.2.4)\nmay be put zero), and that the temperature T is small so that only the close vicinity\nof the state {I(st), \u03c8\u02dc(st)} is relevant. The right-hand sides of the equations in (4.2.4) may\nthen be linearized near this state.\nThus, introducing the deviations of slow variables I and \u03c8\u02dc \u2261 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c9f t from their relevant\nstable stationary values,\n\u2206I \u2261 I \u2212 I(st), (5.5.15)\n\u2206\u03c8\u02dc \u2261 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c9f t\u2212 \u03c8\u02dc(st),\nand linearizing (4.2.4) near the stable stationary state, one arrives at the following dy-\nnamical equations:\nd(\u2206I)\ndt\n= \u2212\u03b1\u03c8\u2206\u03c8\u02dc, (5.5.16)\nd(\u2206\u03c8\u02dc)\ndt\n= \u03b1I\u2206I,\n\u03b1\u03c8 \u2261 \u2202\n2H\n\u2202\u03c8\u02dc2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nI(st),\u03c8\u02dc(st)\n, \u03b1I \u2261 \u2202\n2H\n\u2202I2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nI(st),\u03c8\u02dc(st)\n, \u03b1\u03c8\u03b1I > 0,\nwhere H \u2261 H(I, \u03c8\u02dc) is given in (4.2.4) (note that \u22022H\/\u2202I\u2202\u03c8\u02dc\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nI(st),\u03c8\u02dc(st)\n= 0) and the last\ninequality is equivalent [68] to the requirement that the state {I(st), \u03c8\u02dc(st)} be stable.\nThe solution of (5.5.16) is\n\u2206I = \u2206I0 cos(\u2206\u03c9t+ \u03d50),\n\u2206\u03c8\u02dc = sgn(\u03b1I)\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\n\u03b1\u03c8\n\u2206I0 sin(\u2206\u03c9t+ \u03d50), (5.5.17)\n\u2206\u03c9 \u2261 \u221a\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1I ,\nwhere \u2206I0 and \u03d50 are the auxiliary \u201camplitude\u201d and \u201cphase\u201d corresponding to given initial\nconditions; note that \u2206I0 is necessarily small due to the requirement of the smallness of\n\u2206I and \u2206\u03c8\u02dc which we have imposed, because only small values of \u2206I and \u2206\u03c8\u02dc are relevant\nat small T .\n110\nExpanding q1(I) and cos(\u03c8) in Taylor series over \u2206I and \u2206\u03c8\u02dc respectively, and omitting\nfrom the resultant expression for q(t) (5.5.13) those terms which are proportional to\n(\u2206I0)\nm with m \u2265 2, one obtains\nq(t) \u2248 2q(st)1 cos(\u03c9f t+ \u2206\u03c8\u02dc(st)) + (5.5.18)\n\u2206I0\n[(\nq\u20321 + sgn(\u03b1I)\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\n\u03b1\u03c8\nq\n(st)\n1\n)\ncos({\u03c9f + \u2206\u03c9}t+ \u2206\u03c8\u02dc(st) + \u03d50)+(\nq\u20321 \u2212 sgn(\u03b1I)\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\n\u03b1\u03c8\nq\n(st)\n1\n)\ncos({\u03c9f \u2212\u2206\u03c9}t+ \u2206\u03c8\u02dc(st) \u2212 \u03d50)\n]\n,\nq\n(st)\n1 \u2261 q1(I(st)), q\u20321 \u2261 dq1(I(st))\/dI(st).\nThe first term in the above expression for q(t) represents the oscillation at the driving\nfrequency, and it does not contribute to the spectrum of fluctuations since it arises in\nq(t) even in the absence of noise; note that \u3008q(t)\u3009 is extracted from q(t) when Qq(\u2126) is\ncalculated: see the definition (5.5.1).\nThe terms representing the mixed frequencies \u03c9f + \u2206\u03c9 and \u03c9f \u2212\u2206\u03c9, i.e. the Stokes and\nanti-Stokes components respectively, are proportional to \u2206I0 and hence are entirely due\nto noise: it is just noise that causes deviations of I from its stationary (approximately\nresonant) value I(st); the latter deviations give rise to persistent slow oscillations of I and\n\u03c8\u02dc which, in turn, modulate the fast oscillation of q at the driving frequency thus bringing\nthe mixed frequencies into play.\nFurthermore, it can be seen from (5.5.18) that the modulations of angle and action inter-\nfere with each other differently for the Stokes and anti-Stokes components. This interfer-\nence depends on the sign of \u03b1I which, in the ZD case, differs between the nonlinear reso-\nnances whose stable point possess the larger and smaller actions [68] (cf. also sub-section\n4.2). The repopulation of the nonlinear resonances therefore reverses the relative intensi-\nties of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks in the fluctuation spectrum. For the TDO results\nshown in Fig. 66 (see also Fig. 21), the Stokes component prevails over the anti-Stokes\none for the larger-action nonlinear resonance, while it is vice versa for the smaller-action\nresonance.\nIn the asymptotic limit of weak driving (h \u2192 0), slow motion in the different nonlin-\near resonances is nearly identical if the driving force parameters lie on the ZDNR\/NR\nline; the only difference is in the sign of \u03b1I so that, in the different resonances, the cor-\nresponding trajectories in the I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane rotate in opposite directions. Therefore, the\nactivation energies are identical as well. Hence, the repopulation of the resonances occurs\nright at the ZDNR\/NR transition 68 . If we move higher than the ZDNR\/NR line in the\nplane of the driving force parameters (h, \u03c9f ), the smaller-action resonance becomes [68]\nshallower than the larger-action one and, at high enough h, it disappears altogether (see\nsub-sections 4.1, 4.2 and, in particular, the bifurcation diagram of Fig. 24(a)). Hence,\n68 Roughly, this statement holds true for the whole range of small (rather than just for vanishingly\nsmall) h.\n111\nthe population of the larger-action resonance dominates if the working point {h, \u03c9f} lies\nabove the ZDNR\/NR line (i.e. in the ZDNR region) while the smaller-action resonance\ndominates below the ZDNR\/NR line (i.e. in the NR region). This means that the intensity\nof the Stokes peak in the fluctuation spectrum is larger than the intensity of the anti-\nStokes peak if the parameters of the driving force correspond to ZDNR while it is vice\nversa if parameters correspond to the NR. Just such an evolution is seen in Fig. 66: for\nthe top sub-figure, which corresponds to the ZDNR stage, the Stokes peak is a few times\nlarger than the anti-Stokes one (note that the large peak on the far right corresponds to\nlinear response, whose population dominates within this parameter range); in the middle\nsub-figure, which corresponds approximately to the ZDNR\/NR transition, all states are\napproximately equally populated and the peaks under discussion are approximately equal\nas well; in the bottom sub-figure, which corresponds to the NR stage, the ratio between\nthe Stokes and anti-Stokes components is reversed.\nFinally, let us estimate the shift of the peaks away from the driving frequency, \u2206\u03c9 \u2261\u221a\n\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1I , and the ratio between the intensities of the peaks; we also compare these estimates\nwith those for the conventional (non-ZD) case.\nIt follows from Eq. (4.1.11) with n = 1 and V\n(1)\nl \u2261 2q1, which approximates the Hamil-\ntonian H (4.2.4) in the most relevant range of I, that | \u03b1I |\u2248| \u03c9\u2032\u2032m(I(st) \u2212 Im) | while\n| \u03b1\u03c8 |\u2248 hq1(Im), so that \u2206\u03c9 \u2248\n\u221a\nhq1(Im) | \u03c9\u2032\u2032m || I(st) \u2212 Im |. At the ZDNR\/NR transi-\ntion, which is the most characteristic case, it can easily be shown [68] (cf. also Eqs. (4.1.11)\nand (4.2.17) above) that | I(st) \u2212 Im |\u2248 (3hq1(Im)\/ | \u03c9\u2032\u2032m |)1\/3, so that\n\u2206\u03c9 \u2248 31\/6(hq1(Im))2\/3 | \u03c9\u2032\u2032m |1\/3\u221d h2\/3. (5.5.19)\nIt is typically less than in the conventional case [5], where the frequency of eigenoscillation\nin a nonlinear resonance is \u2248\n\u221a\nhq1(Ir) | d\u03c9(Ir)\/dIr | \u221d h1\/2 (see Eq. (4.1.10)).\nThe ratio between the intensities of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks depends strongly\non the parameter\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\/\u03b1\u03c8. It follows from the above estimates for \u03b1I and \u03b1\u03c8 that this\nparameter is\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\/\u03b1\u03c8 \u221d h\u22121\/3. (5.5.20)\nThus, in the asymptotic limit h \u2192 0, it diverges, which indicates (see Eq. (5.5.18))\nthat the modulation of angle is far more important for the formation of the Stokes and\nanti-Stokes components in the fluctuation spectrum than the modulation of action. As\na consequence, the magnitudes of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks should be nearly\nequal in the asymptotic limit h \u2192 0. At the same time, the divergence in Eq. (5.5.20)\nis rather weak so that, at moderately small h, this factor is not large. The contributions\nfrom the action and angle modulations are therefore comparable, resulting in their strong\ninterference and hence in a significant difference between the intensities of the Stokes\nand anti-Stokes peaks. The latter expectation is well confirmed by the top and bottom\nsub-figures of Fig. 66.\n112\nFor the conventional case, the factor\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\/\u03b1\u03c8 is proportional to h\n\u22121\/2, therefore diverging\nin the asymptotic limit h\u2192 0 even more strongly than for the ZD case. However, provided\nh is not too small, the factor\n\u221a\n\u03b1I\/\u03b1\u03c8q\n(st)\n1 \u03c9f\/ | q\u20321 | is still of the order of unity typically,\nso that the absolute values of the contributions to q(t) from modulations of the action\nand angle are comparable with each other, as follows from Eq. (5.5.18). The interference\nbetween these contributions is therefore strong, which causes the Stokes and anti-Stokes\npeaks in the fluctuation spectrum to differ strongly in intensity: cf. Fig. 12 from [106].\n5.5.3 Unsolved problems\nAs is obvious from the above discussion, the study of fluctuation spectra in periodically\ndriven ZD systems is far from complete. We formulate below some unsolved problems\nthat seem to us to be of interest.\n1. Supernarrow transition peaks.\n(a) It is necessary to study in more detail the lines of kinetic phase transitions (KPTs)\nfor at least two characteristic examples of ZD systems: (i) the TDO, which represents\na relatively simple example and typically possesses no more than three stable states\nunder periodic driving; and (ii) the multistable SQUID, which represents an example\nof a strongly nonlinear ZD system and which possesses a separatrix even in the absence\nof driving.\nThe most straightforward way to address such problems is to calculate the activa-\ntion energies by the method of large fluctuations, as in sub-section 5.4. A drawback\nof this method is that it often ends with heavy numerics and it is not easy to single\nout general features from such numerical results.\nAn alternative way might be to reduce the Fokker-Plank equation (FPE) in the\nI \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane to a one-dimensional FPE, through a separation of the relatively slow\nauxiliary action from the relatively fast auxiliary angle (cf. \u2206I0 and \u2206\u03c9t+ \u03d50 in Eq.\n(5.5.17) above), and then to seek a steady-flux solution of the one-dimensional FPE.\nIt may sometimes be possible to find the latter in explicit form (cf. [130], which uses\na similar method for the case of a conventional weakly nonlinear oscillator).\nAfter the KPT lines are found theoretically, it will then be necessary to compare\nthem with experimental measurements of the intensity of the supernarrow transition\npeak as a function of driving parameters.\n(b) It would be interesting to study the shape of the supernarrow peak in cases where\nmore than two states are significantly involved. Such a situation occurs in the vicin-\nity of intersections between KPT lines, where populations of more than two (three,\ntypically) most populated states are comparable with each other.\n2. Partial spectra due to small fluctuations.\n(a) The results presented above in sub-section 5.5.2 provide only a qualitative understand-\ning of some major features of the partial spectra, while the quantitative theoretical\ndescription still remains to be tackled. A major problem that may arise will be the\nexplicit evaluation of the stationary distribution within a given state. For small tem-\nperatures, when the equations of slow motion may be linearized, such distributions\ncan be derived relatively easily; a similar calculation was used in [106] for the case of\na weakly nonlinear conventional oscillator. But in general it is a non-trivial problem,\n113\neven for the case of ultra-low friction. Possibly, it may be solved, or at least simpli-\nfied, by reduction of the corresponding auxiliary FPE in the I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane to a one\ndimensional FPE through a separation of an auxiliary action for this motion from the\nrelatively fast auxiliary angle, with a further search for its quasi-stationary solution\n(cf. the item 1(a) above and [130]).\n(b) In case of a strongly nonlinear ZD system (like a multistable SQUID), or even in the\ncase of a relatively weakly nonlinear TDO but for higher temperatures, harmonics\nwith n 6= 1 should come into play (cf. the weak second-harmonic Stokes and anti-\nStokes peaks in Fig. 12 in [106]). The most interesting among them is the harmonic\nwith n = 0: it gives rise to the onset of a narrow peak (of the width \u223c \u0393) centered at\n\u2126 = \u03c9f , which may be confused sometimes with the supernarrow peak. The method\nfor studying it theoretically could be analogous to that used for the zero-frequency\npeak in the case of a stationary system [145,50,51] but, as in the previous item, the\nmost difficult part of the explicit calculation will probably be related to the explicit\ncalculation of the stationary distribution within the state.\n5.5.4 Conclusions\nAs in any other multi-stable system, the spectrum of fluctuations in a periodically driven\nZD system may consist of a \u201csupernarrow\u201d peak at the driving frequency \u03c9f , arising\nfrom inter-state fluctuational transitions, together with a relatively broad multi-peaked\nstructure attributable to relatively small fluctuations about each of the stable states.\nAt small temperatures, the supernarrow (transition) peak is manifested only in the vicin-\nity of kinetic phase transition (KPT) lines in the parameter space, and its intensity is\nexponentially small beyond these regions. Unlike the case of a conventional (i.e. non-ZD)\nsingle-well oscillator, where there is typically only one KPT line, there are at least three\nKPT lines in the ZD case. The shape of the supernarrow peak is typically Lorenzian,\nexcept in the vicinity of intersections between KPT lines. Detailed studies of KPT lines\nin the ZD case, as well as of the shape of the peak in the vicinity of intersections of KPT\nlines, have not yet been reported.\nSmall fluctuations about a stable state of a periodically driven system cause approximately\nperiodic small oscillations, of relatively low frequency \u2206\u03c9, in the action and angle about\ntheir values in the stable state. These give rise to spectral peaks at the mixed frequencies,\n\u03c9f + \u2206\u03c9 and \u03c9f \u2212\u2206\u03c9, sometimes called Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks respectively. The\nratio between their intensities is reversed if the direction of rotation of trajectories within\nthe nonlinear resonance in the plane I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc changes: such a reversal is due to the different\ninterference between action and angle modulations for different directions of the rotation.\nGiven that the ZDNR\/NR transition results in a repopulation between resonances in\nwhich the directions of rotation are opposite, it also results in the reversal of the relative\nintensities of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks. A quantitative study of partial spectra\ndue to small fluctuations about stable states of a periodically driven ZD system has yet\nto be attempted.\n114\n5.6 Concluding remarks\nA combination of noise and periodic driving in ZD systems provides a wide variety of\ncharacteristic phenomena. In Sec. 5, we have described five distinctly different types of\nsuch phenomena known by the present time. We group the conclusions below according\nto the same classification.\n1. When the periodic driving is weak, so that it does not significantly affect the thermal\nequilibrium, and one is interested in the influence of noise intensity (temperature) on\nthe response to periodic driving (signal) and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), then\nthe possibility of zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (ZDSR) should be considered\nprovided the driving frequency is close to the extremal eigenfrequency of a ZD system\nor to one of its harmonics. ZDSR is said to occur when the SNR possesses a local\nmaximum as a function of temperature. It should be emphasized that ZDSR does not\nrequire bistability, unlike conventional stochastic resonance. The signal itself is also\nstrongly enhanced by noise, and much more strongly than in conventional (non-ZD)\nsystems.\nThe phenomenon of ZDSR is closely related to the zero-dispersion peak in the fluc-\ntuation spectrum (see Sec. 3 above), and the better the separation of this peak from\nother peaks in the spectrum, the more pronounced ZDSR is, i.e. the higher the SNR in\nits local maximum as a function of temperature. Such separation is always provided if\nthe dissipation vanishes: then the local maximum in the SNR goes to infinity provided\nthe driving frequency is exactly equal to the extremal eigenfrequency or a harmonic.\nAt a given dissipation, the best separation of the zero-dispersion peak is provided in\nsystems with more than one separatrix, e.g. such as a SQUID, so that the ZDSR is then\nat its most pronounced.\nThe theory of ZDSR has been well elaborated and tested by analogue experiments\nand computer simulations in many details. Thus, the major problem for the future seems\nto be a realization of the ZDSR in real SQUIDs and using it in various applications.\nIt would also be interesting [47,114] and potentially important to seek ZDSR in\narrays of ZD systems since it promises [114] to be even more pronounced than in a\nsingle ZD system as well as possibly providing an enhancement of a signal propagation\n(cf. [112,113]).\n2. If the frequency of a weak periodic driving is close to a subharmonic of the extreme\neigenfrequency \u03c9m, then the noise-enhancement of the second harmonic generation and\nnonlinear absorption become very pronounced, and much more so than in conventional\nsystems or for frequency ranges beyond the vicinity of subharmonics of \u03c9m. In a sense,\nit is an analogue of the ZDSR but for a nonlinear rather than linear response and\nat subharmonics rather than at the main or multiple frequencies. Similar to ZDSR,\nthe above phenomena promise to be most pronounced for strongly nonlinear models,\nwhere the ZDP in the fluctuation spectrum is well separated from other peaks; however\nneither has the theory been developed for such strongly nonlinear systems nor has the\ncorresponding experimental study yet been done. It seems important to carry out such\nstudies in future.\n3. If the periodic driving is weak, but the noise is even weaker in the sense that the ther-\nmal equilibrium is strongly disturbed by the periodic driving, then the enhancement of\n115\nnoise-induced escape from a potential well due to the periodic driving is typically much\nstronger in ZD potentials than in similar conventional ones. The enhancement is espe-\ncially pronounced if the driving frequency is close to the extremal eigenfrequency and\nthe damping parameter is smaller than, or of the same order as, the driving amplitude\nwhile the latter may remain moderately weak: the major nonlinear resonances (ZD-\nNRs) are then very wide in energy and, in addition, chaotic layers associated with their\nseparatrices reconnect the chaotic layer associated with the barrier level. Consequently,\nthe activation energy may be substantially reduced, even by periodic driving that is\nrelatively weak. Such a strong reduction may have many important applications, in\nparticular for the the creation of a pronounced ratchet effect in periodic potentials. The\nsubject has only recently started to be investigated, so that many important theoretical\nand experimental details still need to be elucidated; the most important task appears\nto be the development of a quantitative theory describing the decrease of activation\nenergy for the ZD case in the underdamped limit.\n4. The most general features of noise-induced escapes from ZDNRs are similar to those\nfor a noise-induced escape\/transition in any other multi-stable system. The initial work\n[78] reduces the non-autonomous problem to the autonomous one, and then studies\nthe relevant most probable escape paths (MPEPs) and the corresponding activation\nenergies by means of the optimal fluctuation method. The most interesting result is\nthat, although there was a reason to anticipate avoidance of the inner saddle by the\nMPEP from the inner focus to the outer boundary of the outer basin, the MPEP does\nin fact pass through that saddle, after which it goes to the outer saddle, smoothly\nturning around both the noise-free trajectory from the inner saddle to the outer focus\nand the MPEP from the outer focus to the outer saddle. We have also suggested (and\nproved) some simple auxiliary rules which help in identifying the MPEP among the\nother extremals prior to a calculation of the action along them. There are still many\ninteresting unsolved problems in the subject, of which the most important in a general\ncontext seem to us: (i) the search for rigorous rules allowing one to select the range of\nthe shooting parameter in which there lies only one value corresponding to an extremal,\nnamely to that extremal whose projection onto the I \u2212 \u03c8\u02dc plane provides the absolute\nminimum of the action, i.e. constitutes the MPEP itself; and (ii) the search for sets of\nparameters at which the MPEP from the inner focus beyond the outer encompassing\nbasin forms a smooth trajectory avoiding the inner saddle, rather than a trajectory\npossessing a cusp in the inner saddle.\n5. The spectrum of fluctuations in a ZD system subject to weak periodic driving and to a\nyet weaker noise consists typically of peaks that are due to small fluctuations about the\nmost populated stable state of the noise-free system. If this is a linear response, then\nthere is just one peak, centered at the frequency of eigenoscillation in the non-driven\nZD system. If the most populated state is one of the nonlinear resonances, then the\nspectrum consists of: (i) two peaks shifted from the driving frequency \u03c9f respectively up\nor down for a frequency \u2206\u03c9 of small oscillations about the stable state of the noise-free\nsystem; and (ii) possibly a narrow (\u223c \u0393) peak centered at \u03c9f . The former peaks arise\ndue to the periodic (with the frequency \u2206\u03c9) modulation of the amplitude and angle\nof the stable constrained oscillations (at the frequency \u03c9f ), while the latter peak arises\nin cases when small oscillations about the stable state are asymmetric, its origin being\nanalogous to the origin of the zero-frequency peak in stationary systems [145,50,51].\nIn rare cases, when the populations of the two or more most populated states are\n116\ncomparable, all the corresponding peaks are present in the spectrum.\nThough the origins of all the major features of the spectral contributions due to\nsmall fluctuations about the stable states have now been understood, a quantitative\ndescription of the spectrum has yet to be achieved.\nIn case, when the populations of the two most populated states are comparable, an\nextremely high and narrow (\u201csupernarrow\u201d) peak arises at the driving frequency: it is\ndue to very rare noise-induced transitions between the stable states of the noise-free\nsystem. The supernarrow peak in the ZD case is quite similar to that in the conven-\ntional case, except when the populations of three or more (rather than two only) most\npopulated states are comparable: in the latter case, the shape of the peak differs from\nthe conventional Lorenzian and it has not yet been studied.\n6 Quantum zero-dispersion phenomena\nTo the best of our knowledge, nothing has yet been published on zero-dispersion phe-\nnomena in quantum systems. At the same time, such studies would be interesting both\nfor their intrinsic interest and because many zero-dispersion systems may operate in the\nquantum or quasi-classical regimes (cf. for example local vibrations in doped crystals [27]\nand underdamped torsional motion in axial molecules [23]).\nWe briefly review below two unpublished incomplete theoretical studies [147,148] under-\ntaken in 1995-1996, presenting initial results and discussing possible approaches for further\nstudies. We hope that these notes will be stimulating for other researchers.\n6.1 Quantum zero-dispersion peaks\nThe present sub-section is based on [147].\n6.1.1 Qualitative analysis\nIn the purely quantum regime, when the extremal energy (i.e. the energy Em at which\n\u03c9(E) possesses an extremum) is comparable with the lowest energy level, zero-dispersion\nbehaviour is unlikely to be manifested to any significant extent. On the other hand, if Em\nlies in the range of energy levels with high quantum numbers so that the motion is quasi-\nclassical, then zero-dispersion peaks may arise in various spectra. Consider a nonlinear\noscillator (Fig. 67). The distance in energy between adjacent quasi-classical levels is equal\nto h\u00af\u03c9(E) [149]. Let the oscillator interact with a thermostat (whose temperature T\n\u223c\n> Em).\nAll levels with energy E\n\u223c\n< T are then populated. If the interaction with the thermostat\nis very weak, then the absorption spectrum contains separate spikes corresponding to\ntransitions between different levels. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider transitions\n117\nbetween adjacent levels only 69 . They are distributed on the frequency axis with a density\nthat, except in the immediate vicinity of \u03c9m, is given approximately by\nD(\u2126) =\n\u2211\ni\n1\n[| d\u03c9\/dE | h\u00af\u03c9]|\nE\n(i)\n\u2126\n, (6.1.1)\nwhere E\n(i)\n\u2126 is an ith root of the equation\n\u03c9(E\n(i)\n\u2126 ) = \u2126, (6.1.2)\nand the summation over i means the summation over all such roots (in the ZD case,\ntypically two).\nThus, everywhere except the immediate vicinity of \u03c9m, the density of spikes on the fre-\nquency axis is related to the classical spectral densities | d\u03c9(E(i)\u2126 )\/dE(i)\u2126 |\u22121 (cf. the sub-\nsection 3.2).\nThe interaction may be characterized by a parameter that in the classical limit reduces\nto the friction parameter \u0393 (cf. e.g. [2]). If \u0393 increases, then the spikes become broader\n(and lower). On further increase of \u0393, the width of a partial spike calculated in the weak-\ninteraction approximation becomes comparable with the distance between maxima of\nadjacent spikes. Interference between the corresponding transitions then comes into play\nand the weak-interaction approximation no longer provides a quantitative description of\nthe spectrum. But it still allows us to draw some qualitative conclusions. Thus, if the\nwidth of the \u201cpartial spike\u201d greatly exceeds the distance between the adjacent spikes, this\nindicates that a broad continuous spectrum is formed. Its value at each given frequency\n\u2126 is proportional to the number of significantly contributing transitions which, in turn, is\nproportional to the concentration of \u201cspikes\u201d calculated in the weak-interaction approxi-\nmation i.e. to D(\u2126) (6.1.1), which in turn is related to the spectral densities of classical\noscillations. Obviously, the spectrum should reduce in this case to the classical limit. Just\nsuch a transformation of the quantum (with separate spikes) spectrum into the classical\none as the interaction parameter grows was demonstrated in rigorous calculations for the\nDuffing oscillator [150,2].\nIn the ZD case, the evolution from the quantum-like spectrum to the classical-like one\nshould possess distinctive features.\nIn the purely quantum stage, the distribution of the spikes on the \u2126 axis thickens as \u2126\napproaches \u03c9m from within the spectrum of classical eigenfrequencies, and then abruptly\nvanishes as \u03c9m is crossed: see Fig. 68(a).\n69 The intensities of the corresponding spectral spikes are proportional to the square of the rele-\nvant matrix elements of coordinate, which are proportional, in turn, to the fundamental Fourier\ncomponents of the classical oscillations [149]; the spikes resulting from transitions between non-\nadjacent levels relate to higher-order harmonics [149], which are typically much smaller in ab-\nsolute value than the fundamental.\n118\nLet us estimate the width of an individual spike (this estimate is valid in all cases rather\nthan in the ZD case only). Given that interaction with the thermostat is weak, we may\ndescribe it merely by introduction of a corresponding phenomenological random force in\nthe Hamiltonian of the system\nH = H0 + qf(t), (6.1.3)\nH0 = \u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2\nd2\ndq2\n+ U(q),\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t)f(0)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t).\nHere, q and U(q) are respectively the coordinate and potential energy of the oscillator\nwhile, for the sake of similarity to the classical description in Sec. 3 (cf. e.g. Eq. (3.1.1)),\nits mass is normalized to unity here and in what follows. The random force f(t) is white\nnoise, where T is the temperature and \u0393 is an interaction parameter which corresponds\nin the classical limit to the friction parameter.\nA description of the system in this way is analogous to neglect of the (dissipative) drift\nin comparison with the diffusion in the classical case, which may always be done in the\nlimit \u0393\u2192 0 (cf. Sec. 3).\nLet us assume that at an arbitrarily chosen initial instant only the nth level of the oscillator\nis populated, i.e. the wave function of the system is\n\u03a8(0) \u2261 \u03a8(q, t = 0) = \u03c8n(q), (6.1.4)\nH0\u03c8n = En\u03c8n.\nAs time passes, the wave function changes and other levels also start to become populated\ni.e. the initial state decays. Let us expand the time-dependent wave function \u03a8(t) over\nthe full set of eigenfunctions of the oscillator,\n\u03a8(t) \u2261 \u03a8(q, t) = \u2211\nk\nck(t)\u03c8k(q)e\n\u2212 i\nh\u00af\nEkt, (6.1.5)\nck(0) =\n{\n1 at k=n,\n0 at k 6=n.\nUsing standard time-dependent perturbation theory [149], averaging the result over the\nnoise, and omitting terms \u221d tl with l \u2265 2, one can obtain for the initial stage of the decay\nof the population of the initial (i.e. nth) level:\n\u3008| cn(t) |2\u3009 \u2248 1\u2212 t2\u0393T\n\u2211\nk 6=n | qkn |2\nh\u00af2\n, (6.1.6)\nqkn \u2261\n\u222b\ndq \u03c8\u2217kq\u03c8n.\n119\nIf the nonlinearity is small, i.e. the potential is nearly parabolic, U(q) \u2248 \u03c92q2\/2, then the\nmatrix elements for transitions between non-adjacent levels are approximately equal to\nzero while | qk(k\u22121) |=| q(k\u22121)k |\u2248\n\u221a\nkh\u00af\/(2\u03c9) [149], so that\n\u2211\nk 6=n\n| qkn |2\u2248| q(n\u22121)n |2 + | q(n+1)n |2\u2248 (2n\u2212 1)h\u00af\n2\u03c9\n\u2248 E\n\u03c92\n, (6.1.7)\nU(q) \u2248 \u03c9\n2q2\n2\n, n\u001d 1.\nIn the general case, (6.1.7) is not satisfied quantitatively but it can typically still be used\nas the basis for rough qualitative estimations.\nThus, as follows from (6.1.6) and (6.1.7), the initial state decays for a time of the order of\n\u2206t =\nh\u00af2\n2\u0393T\n\u2211\nk 6=n | qkn |2\n\u223c (h\u00af\u03c9(En))\n2\n\u0393TEn\n. (6.1.8)\nBecause of the uncertainty principle [149], the width of the level \u2206E \u223c h\u00af\/\u2206t, so that the\nwidth of the spectral spike in the absorption spectrum\n\u2206\u03c9 \u223c \u2206E\nh\u00af\n\u223c 1\n\u2206t\n\u223c \u0393TEn\n(h\u00af\u03c9(En))2\n. (6.1.9)\nSo, as the interaction with the thermostat grows, the widths of the spikes grow too and,\nwhen \u2206\u03c9 (6.1.9) becomes comparable with the separation between spikes, the interference\nof transitions between corresponding energy levels comes into play (cf. the case of the\nharmonic oscillator [151,152], where all energy levels are equidistant) so that the spikes\nmerge and a united broader peak is formed (cf. Fig. 68(b)). In the ZD system, this process\nstarts in the immediate vicinity of \u03c9m, where the distance between the spikes is minimal\n70\n(cf. Fig. 68(a)). As \u0393 (or T ) grows further, the interference involves more and more spikes\nso that the resulting peak (i.e. ZDP) becomes broader and more intense, reducing in the\nend to the continuous classical form (cf. Fig. 68(c)). The distance between spikes in the\nimmediate vicinity of \u03c9m is \u223c| d2\u03c9(Em)\/dE2m | (h\u00af\u03c9m)2. The condition for \u2206\u03c9 to become\n70 There may be doublets of spikes, both in the immediate vicinity of \u03c9m and beyond it, and\nthe distance between the spikes in the doublets may be vanishing: this occurs if the energy\nlevels on either side of Em generate two very close sets of \u03c9(En), which takes place either if\nEm is very close to one of the levels or if Em is situated very close to mid-way between some\nadjacent levels. In this case the overlap of spikes and the interference between the corresponding\ntransitions may start at much smaller values of \u0393 than that one in (6.1.10). However, unlike \u0393\n(6.1.10), the interference is limited in this case to only these two transitions while others are not\ninvolved. Such interference in a doublet does not relate to the formation of the major part of\nthe ZDP, and we shall not discuss it further.\n120\ncomparable with this distance may be written as\na \u2261 \u0393TEm| \u03c9\u2032\u2032 | (h\u00af\u03c9m)4 \u223c 1, \u03c9\n\u2032\u2032 \u2261 d\n2\u03c9(Em)\ndE2m\n. (6.1.10)\nThe above criterion (6.1.10) for the start of the formation of the ZDP as the interaction\nwith the thermostat increases is the major result of this sub-section. It is worth noting\nthat it can also be obtained in a different way, using results from the analysis of the\nclassical ZDP. Indeed, it was shown in sub-section 3.3 that, in the vicinity of Em, the\nclassical correlation function decays for a time of the order of tzdp (3.3.4); the energy\ndiffusion during this time is of the order of \u2206Ezdp (3.3.5). Obviously, if \u2206Ezdp turns out\nto be less than or of the order of the distance between adjacent levels in the vicinity of\nEm, then neither the classical approximation works nor will a ZDP arise in the spectrum.\nComparing \u2206Ezdp with h\u00af\u03c9m and allowing for p2m in (3.3.5) is typically \u223c Em, one derives\nthat same criterion (6.1.10).\nThus, the qualitative analysis in this sub-section shows that, as the interaction with a\nthermostat grows, the onset of the ZDP in the spectrum and the start of the transforma-\ntion of the purely quantum (spikes-like) spectrum into the classical (broad continuous)\nspectrum occur simultaneously, namely when criterion (6.1.10) is satisfied.\nThe quantitative description of how a ZDP is formed as the interaction grows turns out\nto be a very difficult problem. We briefly describe in the next sub-section two possible\napproaches and the corresponding difficulties encountered by the authors of [147].\n6.1.2 Approaches for quantitative description\nThe quantum analogue of the classical correlation function \u3008\u03d5(t)\u03d5(0)\u3009 may be introduced\nas (see e.g. [150,2]):\nR(q)\u03d5 (t) =\n1\n2\nTr {\u03c1 (\u03d5h(t)\u03d5h(0) + \u03d5h(0)\u03d5h(t))} (6.1.11)\n\u2261 1\n2\nTr\n{\n\u03c1\n(\nU+\u03d5sU\u03d5s + \u03d5sU\n+\u03d5sU\n)}\n,\nU \u2261 e\u2212 ih\u00afHt, U+ = U\u22121,\nwhere \u03c1 is the density matrix, \u03d5h and \u03d5s are respectively the Heisenberg and Schro\u00a8dinger\nrepresentations of the operator corresponding to a given physical quantity \u03d5, and U is\nthe evolution operator [149]. The Fourier transform of R(q)\u03d5 (t) may be called the quantum\nspectrum of fluctuations Q(q)\u03d5 (\u2126). It can be shown that R\n(q)\n\u03d5 (\u2212t) = R(q)\u03d5 (t), so that Q(q)\u03d5 (\u2126)\nmay be expressed via the half-Fourier transform:\nQ(q)\u03d5 (\u2126) =\n1\npi\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ndt e\u2212i\u2126tR(q)\u03d5 (t). (6.1.12)\n121\nWe shall describe below two different approaches to the calculation of the spectrum\n(6.1.12)-(6.1.11). For the sake of simplicity, only the case \u03d5 = q will be considered.\n1. Let us use the phenomenological Hamiltonian (6.1.3), in which the interaction with a\nthermostat is described by the phenomenological random force. It is then not difficult\nto show that\nU = e\u2212\ni\nh\u00af\nH0tT\u03c4 exp\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\u2212 ih\u00af\nt\u222b\n0\nd\u03c4 f(\u03c4)\n\u2227\nq (\u03c4)\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe , (6.1.13)\n\u2227\nq (\u03c4) \u2261 e ih\u00afH0tqe\u2212 ih\u00afH0t,\nwhere T\u03c4 is the chronological-ordering operator.\nAssuming that the temperature is high enough to exceed significantly the width\nof the energy range relevant to the ZDP (cf. Sec.3), \u03c1 in (6.1.11) may be assumed\nconstant within the relevant range of energies, so that the shape of the spectrum of\nthe coordinate is entirely determined by the time evolution of \u3008Tr {U+qUq + qU+qU}\u3009\nwhere \u3008...\u3009 denotes averaging over the random force. If R(q)q (t) is formally expanded\nin a Taylor series over \u0393T\/h\u00af2, then it is possible in principle to average each term of\nthe series over the random force in explicit form [147]. However, the main question is\nwhether or not the series in the corresponding Fourier transform converges. Given that\nthe classical spectrum (3.3.19) depends on \u0393T non-analytically, and therefore that the\nTaylor series over \u0393T diverges, one may expect that the quantum spectrum will also\ndepend on \u0393T non-analytically, given that it must reduce to the classical spectrum in\nthe limit h\u00af \u2192 0. It is therefore unlikely that the quantum spectrum can be found by\nthe above approach.\n2. Another possible approach is analogous to that used for the calculation of the spectrum\n(6.1.12)-(6.1.11) for a particular conventional nonlinear oscillator, namely the Duffing\noscillator (DO), in the range of small energies when the nonlinearity is moderately weak\n[150,2]. The technique is quite complicated and its detailed description goes beyond the\nscope of the present review. So, we give below only a brief qualitative delineation of\nthe work [150] (reproduced also in the review [2]) and indicate the main differences and\ncomplications that arise in the ZD case as well as possible ways of overcoming them.\nThus, instead of using a phenomenological Hamiltonian (6.1.3), the authors of [150]\nstart their consideration from the full system consising of a nonlinear oscillator in-\nteracting with a medium (thermostat) consisting of a quasi-continuous spectrum of\nharmonic vibrations. The Hamiltonian of the full system, expressed in terms of the\ncreation and annihilation operators\n\u2227\na\n+\nand\n\u2227\na for the oscillator and\n\u2227\na\n+\nk and\n\u2227\nak for the\nquasi-continuous-spectrum of vibrations, takes the form:\nH = H0 +Hm +Hi, (6.1.14)\nH0 = HDO \u2261 h\u00af\u03c90 \u2227n +\u03b3h\u00af2 \u2227n\n2\n,\n\u2227\nn=\n\u2227\na\n+\u2227\na,\nHm =\n\u2211\nk\nh\u00af\u03c9k\n\u2227\na\n+\nk\n\u2227\nak, Hi =\n\u2211\nk\n\u000fk(\n\u2227\na +\n\u2227\na\n+\n)(\n\u2227\nak +\n\u2227\na\n+\nk ).\nIt turns out to be possible to eliminate the vibrations of the continuous spectrum and to\nobtain for the operator acting only on the oscillator wave functions (which in a sense is\n122\nanalogous to q(t) in the classical case) a differential operator equation that may be con-\nsidered as a generalized quantum kinetic equation. This operator equation is equivalent\nto a system of differential-difference equations for matrix elements. Introducing a gener-\nating function, the latter system of differential-difference equations can be transformed\ninto a differential equation in partial derivatives of the first 71 order for the generating\nfunction. This equation is solved explicitly and, using it, the correlation function of\nthe coordinate is also derived in explicit form. The Fourier transform can then easily\nbe calculated numerically. As the parameters of nonlinearity and interaction with the\nmedium vary, the spectrum evolves from having pronounced fine structure (the pre-\ndominently quantal regime) to being relatively smooth and broad (the predominently\nclassical regime).\nIn order to include the ZD case within this framework, one has to consider instead of\nthe Duffing oscillator the tilted Duffing oscillator (TDO), whose Hamiltonian contains\nin addition the cubic nonlinearity:\nH0 = HTDO \u2261 h\u00af\u03c90 \u2227n +\u03b3h\u00af2 \u2227n\n2\n+\u03b2h\u00af3\n\u2227\nn\n3\n. (6.1.15)\nIt is then easy to see that the dependence of the energy level En on its quantum number\nn is\nEn = h\u00af\u03c90n+ h\u00af\n2\u03b3n2 + h\u00af3\u03b2n3, (6.1.16)\nso that, if \u03b3\u03b2 < 0, then \u03c9(En), which is \u2248 dEn\/dn, possesses as a function of n \u2248\nEn\/h\u00af\u03c90 an extremum (local minimum or maximum) at\nn = nm \u2261\n[\n\u2212 \u03b3\n3h\u00af\u03b2\n]\n. (6.1.17)\nThe case of the TDO may be treated similarly to that of the DO, described above.\nHowever, unlike the DO case, partial derivatives of up to the second order appear in the\nequation for the generating function, because of the presence of the cubic nonlinearity\nin HTDO (6.1.15). It may not be possible to derive a solution of this equation in explicit\nform. Then, instead of a numerical solution of the second-order equation in partial\nderivatives for the generating function (which is in itself far from trivial), it would\nprobably be easier to go one step backwards, and to solve numerically the system of\nthe differential-difference equations for the matrix elements, restricting oneself to those\nelements corresponding to the energy levels lying in the relevant vicinity of nm: the\nnumber N of the equations should significantly exceed the ratio of the width \u2206Ezdp\n(3.3.5) of the energy range responsible for the formation of the classical ZDP to the\ndistance between adjacent levels (\u2248 h\u00af\u03c90),\nN \u001d 1\nh\u00af\u03c90\n(\n\u0393TEnm\n|d2\u03c9(Enm)\/dEnm|\n)1\/4\n, (6.1.18)\n71 That the partial derivatives are not higher than of first order is because the nonlinearity in\nthe Hamiltonian of the Duffing oscillator HDO (6.1.14) is not higher than quadratic in terms of\n\u2227\nn.\n123\nd2\u03c9(Enm)\ndE2nm\n\u2248 1\nh\u00af3\u03c920\nd3Enm\ndn3m\n=\n6|\u03b2|\n\u03c920\n,\n\u0393 =\npi\n4\ng\u000f(\u03c90), g\u000f(\u03c9)d\u03c9 \u2261\n\u2211\nk\u2192[\u03c9\u2264\u03c9k\u2264\u03c9+d\u03c9]\n\u000f2k\n\u03c92k\n,\nwhere \u0393 is an effective parameter of dissipation arising due to the interaction with the\nmedium [150,2].\n6.2 Quantum zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\nThe resonant interaction of a periodic perturbation (e.g. light) with a quantum nonlinear\noscillator (e.g. an atom or molecule) may have two limiting regimes. One of these, which\nmay be described as purely quantum, occurs when the perturbation is resonant with\na transition between only one pair of energy levels, while the frequencies of transitions\nbetween any other energy levels are distinctly different. In this case, only two energy levels\nare involved in the quantum dynamics caused by the periodic perturbation.\nThe other limiting regime, which relates typically to high-quantum-number (i.e. quasi-\nclassical) energy levels, occurs if the distance between adjacent energy levels varies rel-\natively slowly with quantum number, so that a large number of transitions are approxi-\nmately resonant to the perturbation, and therefore a large number of levels are involved in\nthe dynamics of repopulation caused by the periodic perturbation. It is this latter regime\nthat is called quantum nonlinear resonance [153,154]. The first rigorous quantum (rather\nthan quasi-classical [153]) approach was developed in [154] for quantum nonlinear reso-\nnance in a conventional nonlinear oscillator. In what follows, we shall denote it as QNR.\nIt has many similarities to classical NR. In particular, the energy width of the QNR (or,\nequivalently, the number of levels involved in the QNR) is proportional to the square root\nof the ratio of the amplitude of the perturbation to the absolute value of the dispersion of\nthe classical eigenfrequency [154]. In addition, there are quantum analogues of: the sep-\naratrix [155]; maps exhibiting chaos [156]; and the fast decay of correlations as different\nQNRs overlap [155]. But even for these analogues, there are many distinctions between\nthe quantum and classical cases, and the quantum case possesses some properties that\nare absent in the classical case. A review of QNR properties and a fuller list of relevant\nreferences are given in [83].\nIt is obvious that, in a ZD system, where the distance between quasi-classical energy levels\nchanges with quantum number even more slowly than in the conventional case, quantum\nnonlinear resonance may be expected to be much more pronounced, as well as possessing\nfeatures absent in the conventional case. Initial results on isolated quantum zero-dispersion\nnonlinear resonance (QZDNR) are presented in an as yet unpublished work [148]. Sec.\n6.2.1 below reviews the studies of the isolated QNR [154,155] and QZDNR [148]. Sec.\n6.2.2 lists unsolved problems for the QZDNR.\n124\n6.2.1 Isolated resonance\nWhile considering a single resonance, we shall use an approach similar to that developed\nin [154]. So, let a nonlinear oscillator characterized by the Hamiltonian operator H0 be\nperturbed by a weak sinusoidal force F cos(\u2126t), i.e. the perturbation of the Hamiltonian\nis Vint \u2261 dF cos(\u2126t) where d is a relevant operator of the oscillator 72 . We shall seek the\nwave function as an expansion over the full set of eigenfunctions \u03c8n(q) of the unperturbed\noscillator:\n\u03c8(q, t) =\n\u2211\nn\ncn(t)\u03c8n(q), H0\u03c8n(q) = En\u03c8n(q). (6.2.1)\nThe numbers of relevant energy levels are assumed to be high so that the corresponding\nlevels are quasi-classical and as a consequence [149]\nEn+1 \u2212 En \u2248 h\u00af\u03c9(En), (6.2.2)\nwhere \u03c9(E) is a classical eigenfrequency as a function of energy.\n6.2.1.1. Conventional case.\nConsider first the conventional case [154,155,157] when d\u03c9\/dE is distinctly non-zero in\nthe relevant range of energies, for which 73 \u03c9(E) \u2248 \u2126. Let us denote by nr the quantum\nnumber of the energy level closest to the classical resonant energy Er defined by the\nrelation \u03c9(Er) = \u2126. It then follows from (6.2.2) that dEn\/dn|n=nr is very close to h\u00af\u2126. It\nwill be sufficient for us to keep only three first terms in the Taylor expansion of En as a\nfunction of n:\nEn \u2248 Enr +\ndEn\ndn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nr\n(n\u2212 nr) + 1\n2\nd2En\ndn2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nr\n(n\u2212 nr)2. (6.2.3)\nIt is convenient to separate out the fast-oscillating factor in cn(t).

(6.2.8)\nGiven that \u03bd is necessarily much smaller than the relevant \u201cslow frequency\u201d of the reso-\nnance \u223c\n\u221a\n|V \u00b5| (see below), \u03bd may be put to zero in the zeroth-order approximation 74 so\nthat the resulting equation for \u03d5 is equivalent to the Schro\u00a8dinger equation in the auxil-\niary cosine potential. The problem of its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues is the well known\nMathieu equation [49,158]:\n(\u2212\u00b5 d\n2\nd\u03b82\n+ V cos(\u03b8))\u03c7z = \u03bbz\u03c7z. (6.2.9)\nThe spectrum \u03bbz has a band structure, but only periodic solutions \u03c7z are relevant (see\nEq.(6.2.7)); such solutions correspond [154] to \u03bbz which lie on the boundaries of the bands\n(see [157,158] for more details).\n74 Note however that, for the sake of generality, the computer simulations [155] of eqs.(6.2.6)\nshown in Fig. 69 are for nonzero \u03bd.\n126\nTaking account of (6.2.7)-(6.2.9) and of a property following from the orthogonality and\nperiodicity of the relevant eigenfunctions \u03c7z,\n\u2211\nk\n\u03c7\u02dc\u2217z(k)\u03c7\u02dcz\u2032(k) = \u03b4zz\u2032 , (6.2.10)\n\u03c7\u02dcz(k) \u2261 1\n2pi\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03b8 \u03c7z(\u03b8)e\n\u2212ik\u03b8, \u03c7\u02dc\u2217z(k) = \u03c7\u02dcz(\u2212k),\none can obtain (cf. [154]) the following expression for Am(\u03c4) via the set of initial ampli-\ntudes {Ak(0)} in the zero-order approximation (\u03bd = 0):\nAm(\u03c4) =\n\u2211\nz\n\u2211\nk\nAk(0)\u03c7\u02dcz(m)\u03c7\u02dcz(\u2212k)e\u2212i\u03bbz\u03c4 . (6.2.11)\nUsing (6.2.11), and taking into account the relation [149] between the number of zeros\nin an eigenfunction of a Schro\u00a8dinger equation and the quantum number of the energy\nlevel corresponding to this eigenfunction, it can be shown that the levels trapped in\nthe resonance, i.e. levels with mixed dynamics, are those with quantum numbers m in\nthe interval [\u2212\u03b4n\/2, \u03b4n\/2]. Here \u03b4n is of the order of the number of levels in a single\n(isolated) well of the auxiliary cosine potential (6.2.9), which is 75 itself of the order of the\nratio of the potential barrier |V | to the eigenfrequency in the bottom of the potential well\n\u2126b =\n\u221a\n2|\u00b5V |, i.e. \u03b4n \u223c\n\u221a\n|V\/\u00b5| \u221d\n\u221a\nF\/|d\u03c9(Er)\/dEr|. The latter dependence is similar to\nthat of the width of classical NR on driving amplitude. A more accurate estimate, based\non the properties of periodic Mathieu functions [158], is suggested in [155]:\n\u03b4n \u2248 4\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223V\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (6.2.12)\nThe paper [155] presents results of computer simulations of the dynamics of populations\nbased on Eqs. (6.2.6) for a given set of parameters and various initial distributions of the\namplitudes Am. One of the main features of QNR is the formation of a steady regime after\nsome transient period. If initially populated levels possess quantum numbers m within\nthe interval [\u2212\u03b4n\/2, \u03b4n\/2], then the wave packet is spread over the whole interval during\nsome time \u03c4 \u2217. The spreading then stops and the subsequent dynamics is reduced to an\noscillatory redistribution between levels trapped in the QNR, possessing a characteristic\n\u201creturn\u201d time \u03c4r. E.g. for the set of parameters V = 5 \u00d7 10\u22122, \u00b5 = 10\u22123, \u03bd = 10\u22123 (the\nlatter corresponds to exact resonance with the transition between the levels m = 0 and\nm = 1) and for the single populated level m = 0 (i.e. Am(\u03c4 = 0) = \u03b4m0), the transient\ntime \u03c4 \u2217 \u2248 200 and the number of trapped levels \u03b4n = 22. The latter matches quite well the\nanalytic estimate (6.2.12) which gives \u03b4n = 28. The return time in simulations, \u03c4r \u2248 360,\nalso well matches the analytic estimate, i.e. the half-period of the eigenoscillation in the\nbottom of the auxiliary potential (6.2.9) pi\/\u2126b = pi\/\n\u221a\n2|\u00b5V | \u2248 314.\n75 Note that (6.2.9) is written in normalized units and, in particular, that Planck\u2019s constant is\nnormalized to unity.\n127\nFig. 69 presents results of simulations [155] demonstrating in QNR the analogue of a\nseparatrix. If the absolute value of the quantum number m of the initially populated level\nexceeds the critical value m\u2217 \u2248 \u03b4n\/2, then only few levels around m(0) become populated\nin the steady regime (see Fig. 69(a)) and the formation time of the steady regime is\nrelatively small. The situation drastically changes if |m(0)| < m\u2217 (see Figs. 69(c-e)): the\ndistribution of populated levels is significantly wider, extending approximately over the\ninterval [\u2212m\u2217,m\u2217], while the formation time of the steady regime significantly increases.\nThe \u201cboundary\u201d case |m(0)| \u2248 m\u2217 is illustrated by Fig. 69(b).\n6.2.1.2. Zero-dispersion case.\nLet \u03c9(E) possess a local minimum or maximum at some E = Em, i.e. d\u03c9(E)\/dE|E=Em =\n0. Let us denote by nm the number of the energy level closest to Em, so that d\n2En\/dn\n2|n=nm \u2248\n0 as follows from (6.2.2). Unlike the conventional case, it will be necessary for us to keep\nfour terms in the Taylor expansion of En:\nEn \u2248 Enm +\ndEn\ndn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nm\n(n\u2212 nm) + 1\n2\nd2En\ndn2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nm\n(n\u2212 nm)2 + 1\n6\nd3En\ndn3\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nm\n(n\u2212 nm)3.\n(6.2.13)\nThe driving frequency \u2126 is assumed to be close to \u03c9(Em) \u2248 dEn\/dn|n=nm . We shall\nseparate out the fast-oscillating factor in c(t) (6.2.1) in the following way:\ncn(t) = Al(t) exp\n{\n\u2212 i\nh\u00af\n(Enm + h\u00af\u2126l) t\n}\n, (6.2.14)\nl \u2261 n\u2212 nm.\nSubstituting (6.2.1), (6.2.14) into the Schro\u00a8dinger equation (6.2.5) and carrying out the\nsame operations as in the conventional case (6.2.6), we obtain:\ni\ndAl\nd\u03c4\n= (\u2212\u03bdml + \u03b7ml3)Al + 1\n2\nVm (Al+1 + Al\u22121) , (6.2.15)\n\u03c4 \u2261 \u2126\u03c4, \u03bdm \u2261\n\u2126\u2212 1\nh\u00af\ndEn\ndn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nm\n\u2126\n, \u03b7 \u2261 1\n6h\u00af\u2126\nd3En\ndn3\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nn=nm\n, Vm \u2261 F\n\u222b\ndq \u03c8\u2217nm d \u03c8nm+1\nh\u00af\u2126\n,\nl\u001c nm,\nwhere we have also neglected the deviation of d2En\/dn\n2|n=nm from zero.\nThen the equation for the auxiliary function \u03c6(\u03b8, \u03c4) (6.2.7) is as follows:\n128\ni\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202\u03c4\n= H(zd)\u03d5, (6.2.16)\nH(zd) = i\u03bdm\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\n+ i\u03b7m\n\u22023\n\u2202\u03b83\n+ Vm cos(\u03b8),\n\u03d5(\u03b8 + 2pi) = \u03d5(\u03b8).\nThe operator H(zd) can be shown [148] to be Hermitian (self-conjugated), so that its\neigenvalues are real while the eigenfunctions are orthogonal each other and constitute\na complete set [149]. Thus, like periodic Mathieu functions, the eigenfunctions of H(zd)\npossess the property (6.2.10) and the amplitudes Al(\u03c4) may formally be expressed via the\nset of initial conditions {Al(0)} by means of Eqs. (6.2.11),(6.2.10) in which the periodic\nMathieu functions \u03c7z are exchanged for periodic eigenfunctions of the operator H\n(zd).\nIt is worth pointing out that both in the conventional and ZDNR cases the corresponding\noperators (6.2.9) and (6.2.16) could be obtained from the classical asymptotic Hamilto-\nnians (4.1.10) and (4.1.11) through the exchange of respectively (I \u2212 Ir) and (I \u2212 Im)\nby the operator \u2212i\u2202\/\u2202\u03b8 and of the interaction amplitude by the corresponding matrix\nelement. This is a consequence of the correspondence principle valid in the quasi-classical\nregime for classical action-angle variables and their properly introduced quantum ana-\nlogues [159,157].\n6.2.2 Unsolved problems\n1. Though the formal solution of the problem of the QZDNR has been obtained, in terms\nof the periodic eigenfunctions of the operator H(zd), explicit expressions for the latter\neigenfunctions have not so far been found. Operators of this kind, i.e. odd functions of\nthe momentum operator, are not studied in quantum mechanics, so that the solution\nof the corresponding eigenvalue problem is a difficult task, even methodologically.\n2. Simulations of the dynamics of the amplitudes Al(\u03c4) and populations |Al(\u03c4)|2 have not\nyet been carried out. In analogy with the classical cases, one may expect that the energy\nwidth of the QZDNR will be \u221d (|Vm\/\u03b7m|)1\/3 \u221d F 1\/3, therefore exceeding typically that\nof conventional QNR which is \u221d F 1\/2 (see Eqs.(6.2.12),(6.2.6)).\n3. It was found in [155] by means of simulations that the overlap in energy between\ndifferent QNRs drastically changes the population dynamics, in analogy with the onset\nof global chaos associated with the overlap of classical NRs. But the overlap in energy\nbetween classical ZDNRs of the same order does not result in the onset of global chaos\n(see Sec. 4). Even the overlap in phase space (the ZDNR\/NR transition) results in a\nchange of the phase space structure rather than in the onset of global chaos in the\nconventional sense. Therefore, it will be very interesting to study, at least by means of\nsimulations, how the dynamics of the populations changes with decreasing distance in\nenergy between two resonances of the same order.\n4. In order to describe explicitly the dynamics of amplitudes Al(\u03c4), instead of the intro-\nduction of the auxiliary function \u03d5(\u03b8, \u03c4), one may exchange the discrete energy level\nnumber l for its continuous approximation: Al+1 + Al\u22121 \u2212 2Al in the discrete descrip-\ntion is exchanged for \u22022A\/l2 in the continuous one. Given that the number of levels\ntrapped in the nonlinear resonance is large, such an approach should provide a good\n129\napproximation, at least in the steady regime (i.e. at large time-scales). The equation of\nmotion for Al(\u03c4) reduces then to the Schro\u00a8dinger-like equation:\n\u2212i\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c4\n=\n[\n\u2212 1\n2ma\n\u22022\n\u2202l2\n+ Ua(l)\n]\nA, (6.2.17)\nma =\n{\nV \u22121 for the QNR,\nV \u22121m for the QZDNR,\nUa(l) =\n{\u2212V\u2212\u00b5l2 for the QNR,\n\u2212Vm+\u03bdml\u2212\u03b7ml3 for the QZDNR.\nSuch an approach may be especially advantageous for the QZDNR since the problem\n(6.2.17) is equivalent to conventional quantum-mechanical motion in the auxiliary po-\ntential Ua, while methods for the solution of conventional quantum-mechanical problems\nare much better developed than those for solution of the eigenvalue problem for such\nnon-conventional operators as H(zd) (6.2.16).\n5. It would be interesting to extend studies of quantum chaos related to QNR (see [83]\nand references therein) to the case of the QZDNR. Given that manifestations of chaos\nrelated to classical ZDNR have many distinctions from classical NR (see Sec. 4), one\nmay expect that quantum chaos related to the QZDNR will differ significantly from\nthat related to the QNR.\n6.3 Conclusions\nIf the system operates in the range of quasi-classical energies, i.e. at high quantum numbers\nn of energy levels En, then the spacing between adjacent levels in this range changes with\nthe quantum number very smoothly and is\u2248 h\u00af\u03c9(En) where \u03c9(E) is a frequency of classical\neigenoscillation with energy E. Then even a weak perturbation may cause a repopulation\nof a large number of levels due to a strong interference between corresponding transitions,\nwhich is analogous in a sense to long-lasting classical correlations. This effect is especially\npronounced in zero-dispersion systems in the range of extreme energy Em, where the\nspacing between levels changes with n especially slowly. This results in a number of effects\nwhich are either much less pronounced in, or completely absent from, non-ZD systems.\nThus, if the quantum ZD system is subject to an external noise, e.g. of thermal origin,\na quantum zero-dispersion peak arises in the spectrum of fluctuations if the interaction\nparameter is larger than, or of the same order as, some small critical value [147] (see Eq.\n(6.1.10) in Sec. 6.1.1 above as well as the schematic Fig. 67). The phenomenon has not yet\nbeen described quantitatively but a reasonable modification of the corresponding approach\nused for the conventional case [150,2] was suggested [147] for the case of interaction with\na thermostat of the quasi-continuous spectrum of vibrations (see Sec. 6.1.2).\nIf the quantum ZD system is periodically driven at a frequency close to \u03c9(Em) or one\nof its harmonics, then the phenomenon of quantum zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\n(QZDNR) may occur [148]. It is expected to have many distinctive features compared to\nconventional quantum nonlinear resonance (QNR) [154]. In particular, QZDNR promises\nto be wider than the QNR, and the dynamics of repopulation of the quantum levels at the\noverlap of two QZDNRS of the same order promises to be very different from that at the\n130\noverlap of QNRs, which are necessarily of different orders. A very preliminary quantitative\nstudy [148] of QZDNR was reviewed in Sec. 6.2.1, and it would be interesting to extend\nthese investigations in the ways discussed in Sec. 6.2.2.\nIt is also worth noting that the simultaneous action of noise and a periodic force on the\nquantum ZD system has not yet been studied at all. It would be interesting to do so, given\nthat in classical cases such simultaneous action gives rise to many interesting phenomena\n(see Sec. 5), in particular to zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (see Sec. 5.1). Note that\nan analogue of conventional stochastic resonance in some non-ZD quantum system has\nbeen considered in [160].\n131\n7 Concluding remarks\nWe hope that we have managed to demonstrate in this review that zero-dispersion systems\nare rather widespread in nature and form a distinct class of systems with characteristic\nproperties. If subject to external action, they may manifest resonant behaviour in a much\nmore pronounced way than conventional systems and, moreover, some of the phenomena\ncan occur only in ZD systems.\nWe have reviewed three characteristic types of action on classical ZD systems: noise (ad-\nditive white, mostly), a sinusoidal force, and their combination (additive, mostly). Some\nof the resulting phenomena, such as zero-dispersion peaks in fluctuation spectra, zero-\ndispersion nonlinear resonance and zero-dispersion stochastic resonance, have already\nbeen well established, which provides a good base for a realization in a near future of\ntheir practical applications, apart from a good understanding of various relevant physical\nphenomena. Others are either barely studied or in the midst of being investigated, and\nwe have given our view of the major unsolved problems for each of them.\nWe have also touched the subject of quantum ZD phenomena, which has barely been\nstudied to date and would certainly be interesting for future investigations.\nWe hope that, apart from the reviewed phenomena and systems, there exist many other\nZD phenomena and systems whose identification and study be in the future, and that our\nreview may help to stimulate the further development of this interesting field.\nAcknowledgements\nWe very much appreciate the contributions to many of our works on ZD phenomena by\nour coauthors.

Transformation to slow-fast variables\nWe present here the transformation between the momentum-coordinate and energy-angle\nor action-angle variables, as well as the dynamical equations for the latter variables in the\ncase of non-Hamiltonian motion.\nLet the (p\u2212 q) variables obey the following equations\nq\u02d9 =\n\u2202H(q, p)\n\u2202p\n+ fq(q, p, t),\np\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202H(q, p)\n\u2202q\n+ fp(q, p, t), (A.1)\nwhere fq and fp are some functions of q, p, t.\nOne may need to use canonical transformation between (p \u2212 q) and I \u2212 \u03c8 (or a closely\nrelated pair of variables E \u2212 \u03c8). Let us first express E,\u03c8, I via p, q.\nE = H(q, p), (A.2)\n\u03c8 =\n[\n\u03c9(E)\n\u222b dq\np(q, E)\n]\nE=H(q,p)\n, (A.3)\nwhere \u03c9(E) is the frequency of eigenoscillation in the Hamiltonian system at the energy\nE, while p(q, E) is to be found from (A.2).\nThe action I is related to energy E by the relation [1]\nI \u2261 I(E) =\nE\u222b\nEmin\ndE\u02dc \u03c9\u22121(E\u02dc), (A.4)\nwhere Emin is a relevant local minimum of E in (A.2).\nOn the other hand, q and p may be expressed via E and \u03c8:\nq =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\nqn(E) exp(\u2212in\u03c8),\np = \u2212i\u03c9(E)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\nnqn(E) exp(\u2212in\u03c8). (A.5)\nNow, let us derive from (A.1) the dynamical equations for E \u2212 \u03c8. Differentiating (A.2)\n133\nwith respect to t and using (A.1), one derives\nE\u02d9 =\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\nfp +\n\u2202H\n\u2202q\nfq. (A.6)\nTo derive the equation for \u03c8, we use a more sophisticated method since the straightfor-\nward differentiation of (A.3) does not immediately lead to a simple result. We formally\ndifferentiate \u03c8 as a function of q, p and use (A.1):\n\u03c8\u02d9=\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\nq\u02d9 +\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202p\np\u02d9 =\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202p\n\u2202H\n\u2202q\n+\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\nfq +\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202p\nfp (A.7)\n=\u03c9(E) +\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\nfq +\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202p\nfp.\nWe used in the derivation of the last equality in (A.7) the fact that the case of fq = fp = 0\ncorresponds to conservative motion, when d\u03c8\/dt = \u03c9(E) [1], whereas the form of the first\ntwo terms in the middle equality in (A.7) is independent of fq, fp.\nIn order to find \u2202\u03c8\/\u2202q \u2261 (\u2202\u03c8\/\u2202q)p, the partial derivative of \u03c8 with respect to q at a\nconstant p, we use the following trick. On the one hand,(\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\n)\np\n= 0, (A.8)\nwhile, on the other hand,(\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\n)\np\n=\n(\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03c8\n)\nE\n(\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\n)\np\n+\n(\n\u2202p\n\u2202E\n)\n\u03c8\n(\n\u2202E\n\u2202q\n)\np\n. (A.9)\nTaking into account that(\n\u2202E\n\u2202q\n)\np\n\u2261\n(\n\u2202H\n\u2202q\n)\np\n= \u2212\n(\ndp\ndt\n)\nE\n= \u2212\n(\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03c8\n)\nE\n(\nd\u03c8\ndt\n)\nE\n= \u2212\n(\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03c8\n)\nE\n\u03c9(E), (A.10)\nwe obtain from (A.9)(\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\n)\np\n= \u03c9(E)pE. (A.11)\nSimilarly, analysing (\u2202q\/\u2202p)q, one can obtain(\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202p\n)\nq\n= \u2212\u03c9(E)qE. (A.12)\n134\nPutting (A.11),(A.12) into (A.7), we finally obtain\n\u03c8\u02d9 = \u03c9(E) + \u03c9(E)pEfq \u2212 \u03c9(E)qEfp. (A.13)\nThus, Eqs. (A.6),(A.13) are dynamical equations in terms of E\u2212\u03c8 variables. For the case\nH =\np2\n2\n+ U(q), (A.14)\nfq = 0,\nfp = \u2212\u0393p+ f(t),\nmost often used in the review, equations (A.6),(A.13) reduce to\nE\u02d9 = \u2212\u0393p2 + pf(t),\n\u03c8\u02d9 = \u03c9(E) + \u0393\u03c9(E)pqE \u2212 \u03c9(E)qEf(t).

Note in (b) the logarithmic vertical scale and the ordinate scaling factor of\nq1m\/(\u0393Im) = 159. Black lines indicate local bifurcations: the full line bounds the region within\nwhich both the linear (S1) response and one or both of the nonlinear (S2, S3) responses can\nexist. The upper part of this line marks the boundary of linear response, and the lower part that\nfor nonlinear response. Both nonlinear responses coexist in the region to the right of the dashed\nblack line in (a), or between the upper and lower parts of the dashed black line in (b). The full\ngreen lines mark the ZDNR\/NR transition, which corresponds to either the o \u2194 g separatrix\nreconnection (cf. Figs. 25(a,b)) in the non-dissipative case (a), or to the o\u2192 g heteroclinic orbit\nin the dissipative case (b).

Blue lines correspond to the g \u2192 y\nheteroclinic orbit: the full line corresponds to a slip of the end of a trajectory emerging from the\ngreen saddle between adjacent linear responses, while the dashed line corresponds to slip of the\ntrajectories emerging from green saddles between adjacent nonlinear responses.

Moreover, if the potential is asymmetric, then the di;erence between U (+) and\nU (\u2212) also oscillates; and the smaller \u0018, the faster the oscillations become.\nThus, as \u0018 decreases, the situation when the (relatively small) non-ZD contribution is extracted\nfrom the (much larger) ZD one alternates with the situation when the contributions are added to\neach other. Moreover, in the asymmetric potential this alternation occurs di;erently for escape to\nthe left and to the right. So, the direction of the di;usion alternates as well provided that A is still\n\u0003\u0018. In fact, this conclusion is not restricted to the ZD case but is valid generally: some evidence\nin support of it was contained earlier in [95] (see Fig. 54, reproducing Fig. 1 from [95]). But, in\nthe ZD case, the amplitude of the oscillations of |?\u02dc(+)|\u2212 |?\u02dc(\u2212)| may be larger. Indeed, this amplitude\nis equal to the doubled contribution from the time range near tns in the ns harmonic, 2|?\u02dcns |, while\na similar contribution in the non-ZD case dominates in ?\u02dc. Thus the di;erence between |?\u02dc(+)| and\n|?\u02dc(\u2212)|, which arises because of the di;erent results of interference with the next (by absolute value)\ncontribution, is obviously smaller than 2|?\u02dcns |.\nFig. 61.
