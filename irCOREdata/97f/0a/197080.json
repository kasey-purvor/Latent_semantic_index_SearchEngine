The system issues a graded series of prescribing alerts (low-level, intermediate, and high-level), and warnings and prompts to respond to abnormal test results. These may be overridden or heeded, except for high-level prescribing alerts, which are indicative of a potentially serious error and impose a \u2018hard stop\u2019. \\ud\nSetting: A large teaching hospital. \\ud\nParticipants: All junior doctors in the study setting. \\ud\nMain outcome measures: Rates of prescribing alerts and laboratory warnings and doctors' responses. \\ud\nResults: Altogether 848,678 completed prescriptions issued by 381 doctors (median 1538 prescriptions per doctor, interquartile range [IQR] 328\u20133275) were analysed. We identified 895,029 low-level alerts (median 1033 per 1000 prescriptions per doctor, IQR 903\u20131205) with a median of 34% (IQR 31\u201339%) heeded; 172,434 intermediate alerts (median 196 per 1000 prescriptions per doctor, IQR 159\u2013266), with a median of 23% (IQR 16\u201330%) heeded; and 11,940 high-level \u2018hard stop\u2019 alerts. Doctors vary greatly in the extent to which they trigger and respond to alerts of different types. The rate of high-level alerts showed weak correlation with the rate of intermediate prescribing alerts (correlation coefficient, r = 0.40, P = <0.001); very weak correlation with low-level alerts (r = 0.12, P = 0.019); and showed weak (and sometimes negative) correlation with propensity to heed test-related warnings or alarms. The degree of correlation between generation of intermediate and high-level alerts is insufficient to identify doctors at high risk of making serious errors. \\ud\nConclusions: Routine data from an electronic prescribing system should not be used to identify doctors who are at risk of making serious errors.
