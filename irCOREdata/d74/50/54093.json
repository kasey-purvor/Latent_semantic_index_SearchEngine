Observations were made in the southwestern part of Ronne Ice\nShelf, about 500 km from open water. The mean basal ablation rate was measured over a month-long and\na year-long period using phase-sensitive radar to record the thinning of the ice shelf. Ocean temperatures\nwere observed within about 25 m of the ice shelf base over the period of the radar observations, while the\ntidally dominated ocean currents were estimated from tidal analysis of collocated current observations from\nan earlier period. Ablation rates derived using these ocean data and a number of bulk parameterizations of\nturbulent transfer within the boundary layer are compared with the direct measurements. The ablation rates\nderived using a parameterization that explicitly includes the impact of ocean currents on the turbulent\ntransfer of heat and salt match the observations to within 40%; with suitable tuning of the drag coefficient, the\nmismatch can be reduced below the level of the observational errors.

Introduction\nIce shelves are floating extensions that form at the\nmargins of ice sheets where the ice is not thick enough to\nmaintain contact with a bed that lies below sea level.\nBeneath the ice shelves is a unique oceanic environ-\nment, isolated from the atmosphere by ice that typically\nranges from 100 to 2000 m thick and forced to a large\nextent by the phase changes that occur at the ice shelf\nbase. The processes that occur at the interface between\nice shelf and ocean constitute the only direct interaction\nbetween the earth\u2019s ice sheets and oceans and have\nimportant implications for both. Modification of water\nmasses beneath the Antarctic ice shelves is one step in\nthe formation of the densest varieties of Antarctic\nBottomWater (e.g., Nicholls et al. 2009), the descent of\nwhich to the ocean abyss represents the deepest limb of\nthe global meridional overturning circulation. Mass ex-\nchange at the ice shelf base is the most important driver\nof changes in ice shelf thickness, and these, through the\ndynamic coupling between ice sheet and ice shelf (Schoof\n2007), affect the discharge of grounded ice to the ocean\nand hence global eustatic sea level.\nThe interaction between ice shelves and the ocean is\nthus a key element of the climate system; however, the\nprocesses are immensely challenging to observe. A num-\nber of access holes have been drilled through ice shelves\n(e.g., Nicholls et al. 2009), but the limited availability of\nslim-line instrumentation that can be deployed through\na typically 30 cm wide opening has restricted the types\nof measurements that have been made in the water col-\numn beneath. Crucially, there have been, as yet, no ob-\nservations of turbulent transfer in the oceanic boundary\nlayer at the ice shelf base. Turbulent mixing is the critical\nprocess by which the sensible heat content and motion\nof the water is translated into the phase changes that\ncontrol both the mass balance of the ice shelf and the\nbuoyancy forcing on the subice ocean circulation.\nModels of the circulation beneath ice shelves thus\ntend to draw on knowledge gained from observations\nof the turbulent boundary layer beneath sea ice so as to\nparameterize the thermodynamic interaction between\nice and ocean (Holland and Jenkins 1999). Also tech-\nnically challenging to make, observations beneath sea\nice are at least free of the geometric constraints imposed\nCorresponding author address:Adrian Jenkins, British Antarctic\nSurvey, High Cross, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0ET,\nUnited Kingdom.\nE-mail: ajen@bas.ac.uk\n2298 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nDOI: 10.1175\/2010JPO4317.1\n\u0002 2010 American Meteorological Society\non the instrumentation that can be deployed through\na 30-cm borehole, and the literature on the turbulent\noceanic boundary layer beneath sea ice is comparatively\nextensive (e.g., McPhee 2008). Although this knowledge\nshould, in principle, be transferrable to the subice shelf\nboundary layer, there are subtle differences in the na-\nture of the ice\u2013ocean interface and dynamics of the\nboundary layer. The ice shelf base will be mostly free of\nthe large-scale irregularities associated with ridges and\nleads in sea ice, although limited areas are subject to\nrifting and could feature other complexities that might\nbe unsuspected from observations of the upper surface\nmorphology (Nicholls et al. 2006). Also, the current shear\nthat is the main source of turbulent kinetic energy near\nthe ice shelf base is generated by the interaction of the\nfar-field flow with a solid, motionless boundary, more\nanalogous to the benthic than to the surface boundary\nlayer, while the large-scale slope of the ice shelf base\nmeans that the buoyancy-driven flow of the boundary\nlayer itself can become a major contributor to the cur-\nrent shear.\nIn this paper, we analyze a unique set of observations\nthat enables us, for the first time, to test the various\nparameterizations of turbulent transfer through the ice\u2013\nocean boundary layer that have been used in models of\nocean circulation beneath ice shelves. The observations\nwere made on the Ronne Ice Shelf, which together with\nthe Filchner Ice Shelf comprises volumetrically the larg-\nest contiguous body of floating ice on the planet. The\nice at the measurement site, located 500 km from the\nice front (Fig. 1), is about 820 m thick. In early 1996,\nan instrument string was installed beneath the ice shelf\n(Nicholls et al. 1997) and data were logged until late\n2002. The data initially included conductivity, tempera-\nture, and currents, but the number of time series grad-\nually diminished as instruments and batteries expired.\nNeither the response time of the instruments nor their\nspatial arrangement was adequate to resolve turbulent\ntime and length scales and, therefore, the heat and salt\nfluxes to the ice base. However, between early January\nand mid-December 2001 a series of measurements were\nmade to determine the basal ablation rate of the ice shelf\nat the same site. When combined with data from therm-\nistors frozen into the ice near the ice shelf base, these\nobservations give us all of the information required to\nestimate the net scalar fluxes that result from turbulent\ntransfer through the oceanic boundary layer. The tech-\nnique used to measure the basal ablation is described in\ndetail by Corr et al. (2002) and Jenkins et al. (2006). At its\nheart is the precise measurement of ice thickness changes\nby phase-sensitive radar.\nWe begin by reviewing the theory of turbulent transfer\nthrough the ice\u2013ocean boundary layer and by summarizing\nthe various parameterizations of the process that have\nbeen used in models of ocean circulation beneath ice\nshelves. Next, we describe the phase-sensitive radar data\nand their interpretation in terms of the average basal\nablation rate. The ocean data are then discussed and\nused to derive best estimates of the temperature and\nflow of the water near the ice\u2013ocean interface over the\nyear of the radar observations. We then use these tem-\nperatures and currents to calculate time series of abla-\ntion rate using a number of formulations for bulk scalar\ntransfer through the boundary layer and compare the\naverages with the ablation rates measured by the radar.\nFinally, we suggest an optimal set of equations and pa-\nrameters for use in models of the ocean circulation be-\nneath ice shelves.\n2. Scalar transfer through the ice\u2013ocean\nboundary layer\nThe turbulent ice\u2013ocean boundary layer can be con-\nceptually divided into two regions: the surface layer,\ntypically a few meters thick, where turbulent mixing is\ninfluenced by the proximity of the boundary and the\nouter layer, which typically extends over a few tens of\nmeters, where the turbulence is unaffected by the bound-\nary and rotation and stratification provide the main con-\ntrols on mixing (McPhee 2008). Within the surface layer,\nan interfacial sublayer, where the transfer of momentum\noccurs predominantly through molecular viscosity and\ndirect interaction of the flow with surface roughness\nFIG. 1. Map showing the location of the study site on the Ronne\nIce Shelf.\nOCTOBER 2010 J ENK IN S ET AL . 2299\nelements, occupies the fewmillimeters up to centimeters\nclosest to the ice\u2013ocean interface. Seawater has a high\nmolecular Prandtl number (ratio of kinematic viscosity\nto thermal diffusivity) and a very high molecular Schmidt\nnumber (ratio of kinematic viscosity to haline diffusivity),\nso a comparatively large part of the temperature and\nsalinity changes between the interface and the far field\noccur over the interfacial sublayer (Steele et al. 1989),\nresulting in relatively uniform scalar concentrations be-\nyond the sublayer and frequently the formation of a dis-\ntinct mixed layer. Consequently, expressions for scalar\ntransfer through the ice\u2013ocean boundary layer tend to\nbe dominated by parameterizations of the interfacial\nsublayer and show little sensitivity to the treatment of\nmixing in the remainder of the surface and outer layers\n(McPhee et al. 1987).\nDiagnosis of the ablation rate at the base of an ice\nshelf requires a consideration of the heat balance at the\nphase change interface. We can express this as\nr\ni\na\nb\nL\ni\n5 r\ni\nc\ni\nk\ni\n\u203aT\ni\n\u203az\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\nb\n\u0002 r\nw\nc\nw\nu*GT [Tf (Sb, Pb)\u0002 Tw],\n(1)\nwhere r is density, L is latent heat of fusion, c is specific\nheat capacity, k is thermal diffusivity, T is temperature,\nS is salinity, and P is pressure; the subscripts i, b,w, and f\nrefer to ice, ice\u2013ocean boundary, water, and the freezing\npoint, respectively. The ablation rate at the ice\u2013ocean\nboundary, ab, is expressed as a change in thickness of\nsolid ice per unit time, is positive for ablation, and is\ndetermined by the divergence of the sensible heat flux at\nthe phase change interface. The first term on the right-\nhand side is the conductive heat flux into the ice, while\nthe second term represents the turbulent heat flux\nthrough the oceanic boundary layer. Quantification of\nthis latter term, via a simple turbulence closure, is the\nmain aim of this paper. The closure used in (1) and\nthroughout this paper expresses the heat flux as the\nproduct of the interfacial friction velocity u\n*\n, a dimen-\nsionless, turbulent transfer coefficient for heat, GT, and\nthe difference in temperature between the ice\u2013ocean\ninterface (assumed to be at the freezing point in situ)\nand the outer edge of the boundary layer. In practice, if\nwell-mixed conditions develop over part of the bound-\nary layer, Tw corresponds to the temperature of the\nmixed layer. The definition of the turbulent transfer\ncoefficient,\nG\nT\n[\nqTb\nr\nw\nc\nw\nu*[T f (Sb,Pb)\u0002 Tw]\n, (2)\nwhere qTb is the turbulent heat flux, is analogous to that\nof a thermal Stanton number, except for the use in the\ndenominator of the friction velocity, rather than the\nvelocity of the boundary flow. The friction velocity is the\nsquare root of the kinematic stress at the ice\u2013ocean in-\nterface and is normally assumed to be related to the free-\nstream current beyond the boundary layer U, through\na quadratic drag law,\nu2*5CdU\n2, (3)\nwhere Cd is a dimensionless drag coefficient. Use of\nEq. (3) to estimate the friction velocity introduces a sec-\nond dimensionless coefficient, so the use of the friction\nvelocity in Eq. (2) might appear disadvantageous. How-\never, the main impact of the interfacial roughness is on\nthe transfer of momentum through the boundary layer,\nand that is now parameterized through the drag co-\nefficient. The dependence of the turbulent transfer co-\nefficient defined in Eq. (2) on the surface roughness is\nthus minimized, with the result that a constant value\nshould have broad applicability (McPhee et al. 2008).\nThe freezing point of seawater is generally taken to be\na linear function of both salinity and pressure:\nT\nf\n5 l\n1\nS1 l\n2\n1 l\n3\nP. (4)\nThemost accurate form of Eq. (4) is slightly nonlinear in\nsalinity (Millero 1978), but the coefficients l1 and l2\n(Table 1) are chosen to optimize the fit of the linearized\nform at typical seawater salinities. The interfacial sa-\nlinity required in Eq. (1), Sb, is diagnosed from consid-\neration of the salt balance at the phase change interface,\nr\ni\na\nb\n(S\nb\n\u0002 S\ni\n)5\u0002r\nw\nu*GS(Sb \u0002 Sw), (5)\nwhere the diffusive salt flux in the ice shelf is zero and\nthe salinity of the ice Si is generally taken to be zero.\nThe turbulent transfer coefficient for salt GS (a diffusion\nStanton number based on friction velocity) is much\nsmaller than the equivalent coefficient for heat because\nof the dominant role played by molecular diffusion within\nthe interfacial sublayer (Steele et al. 1989).\nTABLE 1.

A\nsuitable drag coefficient is arguably the biggest unknown\nin the above system of equations. It is normally assumed\nthat the drag coefficient at the ice shelf base will have\na value similar to that at the seabed, but little is actually\nknown about the roughness characteristics of an ice shelf\nbase, other than that they can be highly variable (Nicholls\net al. 2006). A constant value, close to the 0.0025 first\nused by MacAyeal (1984), is usually adopted. Various\napproaches to the specification of the turbulent transfer\ncoefficients have been followed. The simplest (Determann\nand Gerdes 1994) considered only heat transfer and\nmade an implicit assumption that the far-field velocity\nwas constant. Hellmer and Olbers (1989) and Scheduikat\nand Olbers (1990) considered the transfer of both heat\nand salt but made the same implicit assumption of con-\nstant velocity. Jenkins (1991) also considered both heat\nand salt transfer but introduced a velocity dependence\ninto the expressions for the turbulent heat and salt fluxes.\nBelow we describe these three approaches in more detail\nalong with two analogous parameterizations developed\nfor and validated on the boundary layer beneath sea ice\n(McPhee et al. 2008).\nThe earliest parameterizations of turbulent heat and\nsalt transfer through the oceanic boundary layer at the\nbase of an ice shelf were those of Hellmer and Olbers\n(1989) and Scheduikat and Olbers (1990). They intro-\nduced slightly modified versions of Eqs. (1), (4), and (5)\nin which they adopted constant values for u\n*\nGT,S and\ndenoted these dimensional turbulent transfer velocities\nas gT,S. Determann and Gerdes (1994) used the same\nexpression for the heat transfer but dropped the salt\ntransfer equation and set the boundary salinity equal to\nthe far-field salinity. Their use of the same numerical\nvalue for the heat transfer coefficient meant an implicit\nassumption of infinitely fast salt diffusion. This simpler\nformulation was subsequently incorporated into the\nmodels of Grosfeld et al. (1997) and Little et al. (2008).\nJenkins (1991) used the equations and notation of\nHellmer and Olbers (1989) but expressed the turbulent\ntransfer velocities as a function of the mixed layer cur-\nrent so that, apart from the notation, the formulation\nwas identical to Eqs. (1)\u2013(5). In deriving expressions for\nthe turbulent transfer velocities Jenkins (1991) followed\nthe approach of McPhee et al. (1987), but in the absence\nof any knowledge of the ice shelf basal roughness Jenkins\n(1991) assumed the ice shelf base to be hydraulically\nsmooth. The formulation was based on the laboratory\nstudies of Kader and Yaglom (1972, 1977) and has been\nwidely used for modeling the interaction between ice\nshelves and the ocean (Jenkins and Bombosch 1995;\nBeckmann et al. 1999; Holland and Jenkins 2001; Holland\nand Feltham 2006). The application of a laboratory re-\nsult to the stable, planetary boundary layer beneath an\nice shelf might seem questionable. However, Holland\nand Jenkins (1999) showed that it yields similar results\nto those produced by a more complex parameterization\nthat includes the effects both of rotation and of the sta-\nbilizing buoyancy flux caused by freshwater production\nat the ice\u2013ocean interface (McPhee et al. 1987). The in-\nsensitivity to the parameterization ofmixing beyond the\ninterfacial sublayer arises because of the dominance of\nmolecular diffusion within the sublayer in setting the\noverall heat and salt differences across the boundary\nlayer.\nSome authors who have followed the approach of\nJenkins (1991) have used slightly different notation in\nwhich gT,S denotes dimensionless transfer coefficients\nthat include a factor of Cd\n1\/2. Such notation makes ex-\nplicit the direct dependence of the equivalents of Eqs.\n(1) and (5) on water speed, which appears in place of the\nfriction velocity, but leaves an implicit statement of the\nassumed drag law within the expressions for the transfer\ncoefficients. In this form the transfer coefficients con-\nform to the usual definition of thermal and diffusion\nStanton numbers, with the water speed in place of the\nfiction velocity in the denominator of Eq. (2). In this\npaper we prefer the more general form given in Eqs. (1)\nto (5) since it leaves the turbulence closures chosen for\nmomentum, heat, and salt independent of each other.\nWe also adopt notation and terminology that differenti-\nate between a dimensionless transfer coefficient (upper\ncase) and a dimensioned transfer velocity (lower case).\nWe note, however, that our observations do not provide\nus with enough information to evaluate the drag coeffi-\ncient and the turbulent transfer coefficients indepen-\ndently. We can only place constraints on the products of\ndrag and turbulent transfer coefficients and must rely on\nassumptions about the value of one to derive the other.\nThe preceding discussion summarizes what are, to our\nknowledge, all the approaches that have been taken to\nsimulate the basal ablation of ice shelves. In the time\nsince their introduction, a number of studies of the tur-\nbulent boundary layer beneath sea ice have updated and\nrefined the work of McPhee et al. (1987), which was the\nmotivation behind the velocity dependent formulations.\nAs part of this study, we investigate the application of\nthese new insights, discussed below, to the ice shelf\u2013\nocean boundary layer.\nMcPhee (1992) andMcPhee et al. (1999) explored the\nuse of a somewhat simpler version of Eq. (1):\nOCTOBER 2010 J ENK IN S ET AL . 2301\nr\ni\na\nb\nL\ni\n5 r\ni\nc\ni\nk\ni\n\u203aT\ni\n\u203az\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\nb\n\u0002 r\nw\nc\nw\nu*GfTSg[T f (Sw,Pb)\u0002 Tw],\n(6)\nwhere the turbulent transfer coefficient GfTSg was found\nto be nearly constant with a value of around 0.006. Note\nthat the freezing point in the last term on the right-hand\nside is evaluated using the far-field salinity, rendering\nEq. (5) obsolete. Equations (4) and (6) were found to give\na better fit to data obtained beneath sea ice under a wide\nrange of conditions, particularly for very smooth ice, than\na combination of Eqs. (1), (4), and (5) with turbulent\ntransfer coefficients formulated for hydraulically rough\nsurfaces (McPhee et al. 1987). Equation (6) is analogous to\nthat used by Determann and Gerdes (1994), the differ-\nences being their use of a dimensioned turbulent transfer\nvelocity (u\n*\nGfTSg), which we will henceforth denote gfTSg,\nand their implicit assumption of a constant far-field cur-\nrent. However, the dimensionless turbulent transfer co-\nefficient introduced by McPhee (1992), being derived\ndirectly from observations, takes implicit account of the\nrate-limiting process of salt diffusion, and McPhee et al.\n(2008) discuss the differing numerical values of GT and\nGfTSg that are the result of this double-diffusive effect.\nA relationship between GT and GfTSg can be derived\nfrom our earlier equations, given some simplifying as-\nsumptions. Using Eq. (4), we can show that the tem-\nperature differences in Eqs. (1) and (6) are related by\nT\nf\n(S\nw\n, P\nb\n)\u0002 T\nw\n5T\nf\n(S\nb\n, P\nb\n)\u0002 T\nw\n\u0002 l\n1\n(S\nb\n\u0002 S\nw\n).\n(7)\nIt follows that, for the turbulent heat fluxes given by the\nlast terms on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (6) to\nbe numerically equal, the turbulent transfer coefficients\nmust be related as follows:\nG\nT\nGfTSg\n5 1\u0002 l\n1\nS\nb\n\u0002 S\nw\nT\nf\n(S\nb\n,P\nb\n)\u0002 T\nw\n\" #\n. (8)\nCombining Eqs. (1) and (5) and ignoring the less sig-\nnificant first term on the rhs of Eq. (1), we can write an\nexpression for the last term in parentheses in Eq. (8):\nS\nb\n\u0002 S\nw\nT\nf\n(S\nb\n,P\nb\n)\u0002 T\nw\n5\nc\nw\n(S\nb\n\u0002 S\ni\n)\nL\ni\n(G\nS\n\/G\nT\n)\n. (9)\nSince the turbulent transfer coefficients for heat and salt\ntend to be dominated by the parameterization of mo-\nlecular diffusion within the interfacial sublayer, the ratio\nthat appears in the denominator on the rhs of Eq. (9) is\nnearly constant. If the salinity difference that appears in\nthe numerator were also assumed constant, the expres-\nsion in Eq. (9) would itself be constant, and to a good\napproximation GT and GfTSg would be related via\na constant factor. Under these circumstances Eqs. (1)\nand (5) would be well approximated by (6). Note that the\nexpression in Eq. (9) is always positive, so GT . GfTSg al-\nways, reflecting the reduction in the temperature differ-\nence across the boundary layer caused by the lowered\nsalinity at the ablating interface [Eq. (7)]. The size of this\ndouble-diffusive effect is dependent on the relative sizes\nof GT and GS; the smaller the latter is relative to the for-\nmer, the greater the difference between GT and GfTSg. As\nan aside, we note further that GT . GfTSg would remain\ntrue even ifGT and GSwere numerically identical and that\nthe statement GT 5 GfTSg requires GS to be infinite.\nFrom the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the\nrepresentation of Eqs. (1), (4), and (5) by the reduced set\nof Eqs. (4) and (6) is only as good as the approximation\nmade in equating the ratio in Eq. (8) to a constant value.\nThe necessary assumptions will be poor wherever Sb\nvarieswidely or the heat conduction termneglected in the\nderivation of Eq. (9) plays an important role. We note\nthat the approximation is likely to be better beneath ice\nshelves, where the thick ice cover isolates the ice\u2013ocean\ninterface from the influence of the atmosphere, than be-\nneath sea ice. The thermal insulation provided by an ice\nshelf ensures that the first term on the rhs of Eq. (1) is\nsmall and subject to little variability at its base and that\nsolar heating of the ocean, responsible for the highest\nlevels of thermal forcing and hence the lowest values of\nSb beneath sea ice, can never play a significant role in\ndriving ablation at its base. Nevertheless, temperatures\nnearly 48C above the freezing point in situ have been\nobserved near Antarctic ice shelves (Jacobs et al. 1996)\nand even higher values have been recorded in Green-\nland fjords (D. M. Holland et al. 2008). If temperatures\nas high as these were present within the turbulent\nboundary layer, the boundary salinity could fall below\n15 psu and the use of Eq. (6) with a turbulent transfer\ncoefficient evaluated for less extreme conditions would\nbe inappropriate.\nMcPhee et al. (2008) present a formulation analogous\nto Eqs. (1)\u2013(5), where the turbulent transfer coefficients\nfor heat and salt take constant values. Those values are\nchosen such that the calculated heat flux matches that\ngiven by Eq. (6) under conditions typical of those under\nwhich the observations of the turbulent ice\u2013ocean bound-\nary layer have been made. McPhee et al. argue that, al-\nthough the value ofGfTSg used inEq. (6) is the one that can\nbe most reliably inferred from observation, theory im-\nplies that under more extreme forcing the differing rates\nof diffusion for heat and salt in the interfacial sublayer\nwill become important. These are the conditions under\n2302 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nwhich the rhs of Eq. (9) is no longer constant and, in\nsome cases such as when the ice cover is very thin, direct\nobservation of the turbulent heat flux becomes impos-\nsible. To evaluate the ice\u2013ocean heat flux under the full\nrange of possible conditions McPhee et al. (2008) pro-\npose that Eqs. (1) and (5) with constant transfer co-\nefficients represents the simplest possible extension of\nEq. (6) and argue that at present the observations do not\ndemonstrate the need for any greater complexity. Notz\net al. (2003) showed that, using such a model, the ice\u2013\nocean heat flux could be correctly diagnosed under at\nleast one set of conditions in which Eq. (6) failed.\nTherefore, in addition to testing the parameterizations\nof ice\u2013ocean heat transfer that have been used to eval-\nuate ablation at the base of ice shelves, we also follow\nthe reasoning ofMcPhee et al. in investigating the use of\nboth Eq. (6) and Eqs. (1) and (5) with constant transfer\ncoefficients.\nWe note that McPhee et al. (2008) also discussed the\nfreezing process and suggested that the absence of any\nsupercooling in observations made in the boundary\nlayer beneath growing sea ice argued for the use of the\nsame transfer coefficient for both heat and salt in the\ncase of freezing. Beneath ice shelves the process of basal\naccumulation differs substantially from that of ablation.\nEvidence suggests that most ice grows in the water col-\numn as suspended frazil crystals that subsequently settle\nonto the ice shelf base, and modeling the details of this\nprocess requires a very different approach (Jenkins and\nBombosch 1995; Smedsrud and Jenkins 2004). A sim-\nple parameterization might use the same equations as\nthose presented here for modeling ablation but en-\nhance the heat flux through the use of much larger\nturbulent transfer coefficients. However, a detailed dis-\ncussion of this point is beyond the scope of this paper, and\ninwhat follows wewill concern ourselves with the process\nof ablation only.\n3. Direct measurements of basal ablation\nWe determine the ablation rate at the base of the ice\nshelf frommeasurements of the rate of change of the ice\nshelf thickness using ice-penetrating radar. The total\nthickness change is the net result of snow accumulation\nat the surface, compaction of the upper layers of snow\nand firn as they are converted into solid ice, vertical\ncompression of the entire ice column in response to the\ndivergence of the horizontal ice flow, and ablation at the\nlower surface. By observing the movement of internal\nlayers within the column of ice and firn, and deriving the\nmovement of the ice shelf base relative to these, we can\neliminate the processes of accumulation and compac-\ntion, quantify the vertical strain rate, and hence isolate\nthe component of the thinning signature that is the result\nof bottom ablation only.\nFigure 2a shows three typical radar records obtained\nat the study site (Fig. 1) on 2 January, 8 February, and\n19 December 2001. The radar was set up on the ice shelf\nsurface with transmit and receive antennas separated by\na horizontal distance of 5 m. The traces in Fig. 2a show\nsignal strength versus depth, the latter being derived\nfrom the measured two-way travel time of the signal and\nan assumed constant velocity for electromagnetic waves\nin ice. The radar signal is reflected from discontinuities\nwithin the ice shelf as well as from the ice\u2013seawater in-\nterface at the base of the ice shelf. The power received\nfrom the internal discontinuities falls away with distance\nbecause of the geometric spreading of the wave front\nand radar absorption within the ice. However, a distinct\nand reproducible pattern can be seen, at least down to\n450 m, beyond which depth the reflected power drops\nbelow about 2120 dB, the typical level of the back-\nground environmental and system noise. The reflection\nfrom the ice shelf base at 816 m comes in well above the\nnoise level. The basal reflection is much stronger than\nthe internal reflections because the extreme contrast in\nFIG. 2. (a) Radar records obtained at the site shown in Fig. 1 on\n2 Jan (black), 8 Feb (blue), and 19 Dec 2001 (red) and (b) reflector\ndisplacement between the time of the first and second observations\n(blue) and between the time of the first and third observations\n(red). In each case the green lines are best linear fits to the dis-\nplacement data lying between the upper two horizontal dashed\nlines. The lower horizontal dashed line indicates the depth of the\nbasal reflector, where themeasured displacements (circled dots) lie\nto the left of the green lines by an amount equal to the loss of ice by\nbasal ablation over the period between the observations.\nOCTOBER 2010 J ENK IN S ET AL . 2303\ndielectric properties between the ice and seawater re-\nflects almost all of the incident energy.\nBecause the pattern of internal reflections shallower\nthan 450 m is so reproducible, we can correlate the orig-\ninal record with the repeats to derive the change in depth\nof each of the reflectors over the time interval between\nthe observations. The depth change is plotted as a func-\ntion of the original reflector depth in Fig. 2b. The high\nprecision of these measurements is obtained because\nwe record both amplitude (plotted in Fig. 2a) and phase\nof the received radar signal. From the phase difference\nbetween successive observations we can calculate the\nchange in depth of any reflector to a small fraction\n(;1%) of a wavelength (59.8 cm in ice), giving sub-\ncentimeter precision in the measurements. The corre-\nlation of the radar amplitudes is then only needed to\ndetermine the number of whole wavelengths to add to\nthe displacement calculated from the phase difference\nto give the total relative motion of the reflectors.\nThe reflector displacements plotted in Fig. 2b were\ncalculated over the periods from 2 January to 8 February\n(37 days) and 2 January to 19 December 2001 (351 days).\nFor each date, data from six closely spaced radar sound-\nings are included in Fig. 2b, whereas only one of the six\nis shown for each case in Fig. 2a. At the subcentimeter\nlevel of interest here, the ice shelf surface is not a suit-\nable reference point as we disturb the snow surface each\ntime we make the measurements. For this reason, dis-\nplacements in Fig. 2b are plotted relative to a strong\ninternal reflector at a nominal depth of 119 m. The pat-\ntern of negative displacement beneath the reference ho-\nrizon and positive displacement above implies that in all\ncases the distance between the reflectors and the refer-\nence has decreased over time.\nThe data in Fig. 2b indicate that the ice shelf overall is\nthinning and that all of the internal reflectors are coming\ncloser together. The latter is the manifestation of the\nvertical convergence that balances the horizontal diver-\ngence of the ice shelf flow. In the upper layers vertical\nconvergence is enhanced as the low density layers of\nsnow and firn are compacted into solid ice. Since the\nhorizontal flow of the ice shelf is independent of depth\nand the compaction signal is negligible by about 100-m\ndepth, the displacement of the deeper reflectors should\nbe a linear function of depth. In Fig. 2b, we plot least\nsquares linear fits (six for each measurement epoch) to\nthe displacement data obtained between 100 and 450 m\ndepth. We do not use data from below 450 m because of\nthe poorer signal-to-noise ratio, although they clearly\nfollow the same linear trends. Extrapolation of the lin-\near trends to the depth of the ice shelf base tells us how\nmuch of the observed ice shelf thinning is a result of\nhorizontal divergence in the ice flow. The difference\nbetween this and the observed displacement of the basal\nreflector is the result of ablation. We find that over the\n2 January to 8 February period the basal ablation rate\naveraged 0.733 6 0.018 m yr21, whereas the overall av-\nerage for the full 2 January to 19 December period was\n0.554 6 0.006 m yr21. The error estimates are a combi-\nnation of the standard errors derived from the scatter in\nthe results obtained from the six independent observa-\ntions for each time interval and an estimated 1% uncer-\ntainty in the electromagnetic wave speed used to convert\ndifferences in the two-way travel time to displacements.\nA further set of six measurements was made at the\nsame site on 4 February 2001, but the data from this\nvisit and the reflector displacements determined over\nthe 33-day interval from the original observation are\nomitted from Fig. 2 for clarity. We find that over this\nshorter period the basal ablation rate averaged 0.6986\n0.019 m yr21, suggesting a peak in ablation near the\nstart of February.\n4. Observations of the water column beneath\nthe ice shelf\nThe oceanographic measurements made at the study\nsite in January 1996 were described by Nicholls et al.\n(1997), while some of the longer-term records were dis-\ncussed by Nicholls and Makinson (1998) and Jenkins\net al. (2004). Two current meters and five conductivity\u2013\ntemperature (CT) units left in the water column (Nicholls\nand Makinson 1998) yielded records of varying length,\nbut none lasted until the time of the radar observations.\nHowever, a thermistor cable was also deployed to re-\ncord temperatures within about 20\u201325 m of the ice shelf\nbase and this was logged until November 2002. Over the\nperiod of the radar measurements, the temperatures were\nlogged every 15 min.\nThe techniques used to construct, calibrate, and mon-\nitor the thermistor cable are described byNicholls (1996).\nAlthough the precision of the temperature records is a\nfew millidegrees kelvin, the absolute accuracy is poorer\nthan this owing to the uncertain response of the therm-\nistors to pressure. The absolute accuracy, or more pre-\ncisely the accuracy of the measurement of the deviation\nof the temperature from the freezing point at the base of\nthe ice shelf, is important as this is one of the principal\ndrivers of the ablation. Here we set the absolute level of\nthe temperature records by assuming that the minimum\nrecorded temperature is the freezing point at the base\nof the ice shelf. The minimum was seen in September\n1997, with the same temperature again being attained\nin November 2001. As the field site was in a region of\nbasal ablation, it is reasonable to assume that the water\nnever becomes supercooled in situ. This assumption is\n2304 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nsupported by the current meter data, which showed the\nwater flowing as a southward current throughout thewater\ncolumn, that is, from a region of shallower ice. Water\ninteracting with a shallower ice base would be likely to\nhave a temperature higher than the freezing point at\nthe deeper basal ice at the study site. Although we have\ngood grounds to rule out supercooling, it is possible that\neven the lowest temperature observed over the 6.5-yr\nperiod was, in fact, above the freezing point in situ. Our\ncalibration procedure thus yields temperatures that rep-\nresent both a best estimate and a lower bound on the\npossible values.\nThe only available independent check is from the\ntemperature profiles obtained during conductivity\u2013\ntemperature\u2013depth (CTD) casts made just before the\nthermistor cables were installed. A series of profiles were\nobtained between 21 and 22 February 1996\u20143.5 days\nbefore the first thermistor cable data. The profiles gave\nthe temperatures near the ice shelf base as 22.408C,\nwithin a few millidegrees of the lowest calibrated tem-\nperature measured by the thermistor nearest the ice base\nduring the subsequent two months. Since the calibrated\ntemperatures from the thermistors are themselves a lower\nbound, the CTD profiling offers some confirmation of the\ncalibration procedure described above: if the thermistor\ntemperatures were substantially too low, needing to\nbe corrected upward, such an adjustment would make\nthe temperatures recorded during the profiling appear\nanomalously low. Based on this reasoning we place an\nestimate of 10.018C on the uncertainty of the tempera-\ntures from the thermistors.\nAs we have calibrated our temperature record with\nrespect to the freezing point, the absolute value of salinity\nis not critical and salinity fluctuations have only a small\nimpact on the freezing point. Salinitymeasurements were\nobtained during the initial CTD profiling of the water\ncolumn and through the lifetime of the CT units, which\nlasted up to 2.75 yr. In the calculations described in the\nnext section we use the mean salinity observed within the\nmixed layer during the profiling and assume this value\n(34.51 psu) to be constant. The CT unit situated 20 m\nbelow the ice shelf base recorded salinity fluctuations of\nup to 0.1, which would cause the freezing point to vary by\nup to 0.0058C.\nWe have a number of thermistors at varying depths\nbelow the ice shelf base from which to take a far-field\ntemperature record that is consistent with the simple pa-\nrameterizations of the boundary layer discussed in sec-\ntion 2. Under steady forcing, we would expect to see\nrelatively well-mixed conditions over much of the bound-\nary layer, in which case a measurement from any point\nwithin the mixed layer would suffice. However, the tem-\nperatures in the upper 25 mof thewater column, shown in\nFig. 3 for the period of the short-term radarmeasurements\nfrom January to early February 2001, showmore complex\nstructures and much variability. Although relatively well-\nmixed conditions are frequently seen, sometimes underlain\nby a relatively sharp thermocline, this is not universally\nthe case. The mixed layer occasionally thins to no more\nthan a fewmeters, with the penetration of warmth toward\nthe ice base and thermal stratification over much of the\nupper 25 m of the water column (e.g., 26\u201330 January).\nThe temperature record from a little less than 2 m be-\nlow the ice shelf base is shown in Fig. 4 for the entire\nperiod of the radar measurements. This thermistor was\nclosest to the ice base, but well outside the interfacial\nsublayer, and sampled the well-mixed part of the bound-\nary layer. Although this is not the measurement from the\nouter edge of the boundary layer called for by the pa-\nrameterizations of section 2, we argue that the records\nfrom the deeper thermistors will be warm biased because\nof the periods spent outside the mixed layer. We justify\nthe use of temperatures recorded within the boundary\nlayer a posteriori, by the consistency of the results ob-\ntained from several thermistors placed within about 5 m\nof the ice shelf base, compared with the rising ablation\nrates obtained using water temperatures measured at\ngreater distances from the ice.\nThe record from the uppermost thermistor (Fig. 4)\nshows a rapid warming of just over 0.18C during January,\nwith peak temperatures occurring toward the end of the\nmonth when the mixed layer shoaled markedly (Fig. 3),\nfollowed by a gradual decline. This annual temperature\ncycle is similar to that observed in earlier years (Nicholls\nand Makinson 1998; Jenkins et al. 2004), although the\nwarming, attributed to the arrival of a pulse of high sa-\nlinity shelf water generated at the ice front during the\npreceding winter, is somewhat later and of shorter dura-\ntion. The timing of the temperature maximum is consis-\ntent with the inference from the radar measurements of\npeak ablation around the start of February (section 3).\nThe current meter located 20 m below the ice base\ngave a record of only 18 days duration from 26 January to\n13 February 1998. A second current meter suspended\n80 m above the seabed (about 400 m below the ice shelf\nbase) yielded a 24-month dataset covering the period\nfrom 26 February 1996 until 19 March 1998. In some of\nthe formulations discussed in section 2 scalar transfer\nthrough the ice\u2013ocean boundary layer is assumed to be\nlinearly dependent on the water speed, so we need to use\nthe available data to estimate the currents during 2001. In\nthe absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that\nboth current meters sampled the free-stream current\nbeyond the boundary layer, as called for in Eq. (3).\nThe currents recorded at both levels in the water\ncolumn are dominated by tidal activity: the upper and\nOCTOBER 2010 J ENK IN S ET AL . 2305\nlower instruments give mean current values of 2.7 and\n3.6 cm s21, respectively, with a typical water speed dur-\ning spring tides ;20 cm s21. This dominance allows us\nto estimate the principal contributor to the currents at\nthe site during 2001 by calculating the tidal components\nfrom harmonic analysis of the current meter records\nand then predicting the tides for the period covering\nthe radar measurements. Harmonic analysis of the lon-\nger record from the deeper current meter accounted\nfor over 90% of the variance. During the 2-yr-long\nrecord, the nontidal background velocity component\nvaried by around 61 cm s21. We assume that the low-\nfrequency variations in the velocity of the upper water\ncolumn are similarly weak and combine the mean\ncurrent with the tidal predictions to estimate the water\nspeed.\n5. Basal ablation rates derived from\noceanographic data\nFirst we use Eqs. (1)\u2013(5) and the turbulent transfer\ncoefficients introduced by Jenkins (1991) to calculate the\nbasal ablation rate at the study site. Equation (1) requires\nthe temperature gradient within the ice at the ice shelf\nbase. Thermistors frozen into the ice shelf provided\na value of20.358C m21. We used the physical properties\nof ice and seawater, given inTable 1, and a value of 0.0025\nfor the drag coefficient (MacAyeal 1984). Figure 5 shows\nthe time series of water temperature, speed, and the\ncalculated basal ablation rates for the period from\n2 January to 8 February 2001, that is, the period of the\nshort-term radar measurements. The temperatures used\nfor this figure were from the thermistor nearest the ice\nFIG. 3. Water temperatures in the upper 25 m of the water column from 2 Jan to 8 Feb 2001.\n2306 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nbase, estimated to be 1.9 m below the ice\u2013ocean in-\nterface by the end of 2001. The upper panel of the figure\nshows that the peak temperature attained near the ice\nbase was over 0.18C higher than the freezing tempera-\nture in situ, resulting in calculated instantaneous abla-\ntion rates of nearly 2.5 m yr21.\nFigure 6 shows the dependence of the calculated mean\nablation rate on the depth below the interface of the\nthermistor used to give the water temperature. Using\ntemperatures from over 5 m from the ice base causes the\ncalculated ablation rates to rise. The reason for this sen-\nsitivity can be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the uppermixed\nlayer often becoming very thin. Also shown in Fig. 6 are\nthe observed ablation rates obtained from the radar\nmeasurements. Both observed and calculated values re-\nflect the relatively high January rates, and both discrim-\ninate the augmenting effect of including the extra four\nhigh-ablation days near the beginning of February. The\ncalculated ablation rates are about 40% lower that the\ndirect observations, a level of agreement consistent with\nthe observational uncertainties and the rather arbitrary\nselection of the value for the drag coefficient. The best\nagreement would be obtained for this site using Eqs.\n(1)\u2013(5) and the Jenkins (1991) expressions for the turbu-\nlent transfer coefficients with a drag coefficient of 0.0062.\nWe note that adjustment of this one parameter produces\ngood agreement with all observations (Fig. 6). This value\nfor the drag coefficient lies toward the upper end of a\nbroad range of values derived for sea ice by a variety of\nmethods (McPhee 1990). If we allow that the water tem-\nperature measured by the thermistors might be low by\nup to 0.018C, as previously discussed, then the calculated\nyear-round mean ablation rate might be underestimated\nby as much as 0.08 m yr21. Adjusting the temperatures\nupward by 0.018C, the value for the drag coefficient\nFIG. 4. Water temperatures from 2 Jan to 19 Dec 2001 at a\nnominal distance of 1.9 mbelow the ice base. The dotted line shows\nthe seawater freezing point in situ.\nFIG. 5. (top) Water temperature measured using the sensor\nnominally 1.9 m below the ice base, (middle) estimate of the water\ncurrent 20 m below the ice base, and (bottom) calculated basal\nablation rate using Eqs. (1)\u2013(5) and the turbulent transfer co-\nefficients of Jenkins. In the expanded section of the bottom panel,\nbasal ablation rates calculated using the turbulent transfer veloci-\nties of Hellmer andOlbers (cyan), Determann andGerdes (green),\nand the tuned version of the Jenkins formulation with Cd of 0.0062\n(dashed) are added for comparison.\nOCTOBER 2010 J ENK IN S ET AL . 2307\nrequired to best match the observed ablation rates is\nthen reduced to 0.0045. Similarly, an assumption that the\nvelocity has been underestimated by 1 cm s21 would\ngive a corrected drag coefficient of 0.0044. Accounting\nfor both possible maximum errors would give a value of\nCd of 0.0032. In all cases, however, the fit to both short\nand long term measurements is best when using the\noriginal estimates of temperature and velocity.\nAlso shown in Fig. 6 are the average ablation rates cal-\nculated using the other formulations that have been im-\nplemented in models of the ocean circulation beneath ice\nshelves, discussed in section 2. That of Hellmer andOlbers\n(1989) assumes a fixed water speed, but the effective value\nis too low for this particular environment. Computed ab-\nlation rates are reduced by about 10% compared with the\nJenkins (1991) velocity-dependent model and by about\n45% compared with the observations. The heat transfer is\nlow overall because, although the heat transfer velocity of\n13 1024 m s21 is equivalent to the Jenkins (1991) formula\nif the assumed water speeds are rather high (14 cm s21),\nthe salt transfer velocity has a value of 5.053 1027 m s21,\nequivalent to the assumption of very low water speeds\n(2 cm s21). The formulation introduced by Determann\nand Gerdes (1994) yields ablation rates that are too high\nby a factor of ;4. Their implicit assumption about the\nspeed of the water is clearly inappropriate for this par-\nticular site. We note that the lack of a velocity depen-\ndence in these latter two formulations means that any\ntuning to match observations would be site specific.\nThe problem is highlighted in Fig. 5, where the output of\nall the models is compared over a 2-day period in late\nJanuary. The models that respond only to temperature\nvariations produce ablation rate series with much re-\nduced variability. The relatively close correspondence,\napparent in Fig. 6, between the mean ablation rates cal-\nculated with the models of Hellmer and Olbers (1989)\nand Jenkins (1991) is fortuitous and dependent on the\nchoice of averaging period.\nWhile good agreement between observed and calcu-\nlated ablation rates can be obtained for the velocity-\ndependent formulation of Jenkins (1991), this result is far\nfrom being a corroboration of the applicability of turbu-\nlent transfer coefficients derived from laboratory studies\nof heat transfer at hydraulically smooth surfaces. In par-\nticular, we have not demonstrated that the complexity of\nthat formulation is required to explain the observed ab-\nlation rates. We therefore next follow the reasoning of\nMcPhee et al. (2008) and seek constant values for the\nturbulent transfer coefficients that would optimally fit our\ndata. Using Eq. (6) the best fit of the calculated ablation\nrate to the observed year-round average is obtained with\nCd\n1\/2GfTSg set to 5.943 10\n24. Assuming that the turbulent\ntransfer coefficient of 0.006 found by McPhee (1992) for\nsea ice is appropriate in this case implies that the drag\ncoefficient must be 0.0098. Optimizing the fit for the\nsummer peak in ablation yields values of 5.933 1024 for\nCd\n1\/2GfTSg and 0.0097 forCd. UsingEqs. (1) and (5) in place\nof (6) we have two unknowns, which in principal could be\ntuned to optimize the fit to both year-round and sum-\nmertime ablation rates simultaneously. However, given\nthe combined uncertainties in our data, the difference\nbetween our two estimates of Cd\n1\/2GfTSg is insignificant.\nWe therefore have no observational evidence that the\nadditional complexity of Eqs. (1) and (5) is necessary and\nwe lack the information needed to estimate two inde-\npendent transfer coefficients. This probably reflects the\nFIG. 6. Calculated ablation rates averaged over 2 Jan\u20134 Feb 2001\n(red), 2 Jan\u20138 Feb 2001 (blue), and 2 Jan\u201319 Dec 2001 (black).

McPhee et al. (2008)\nargue that for an ablating ice interface the ratio of heat to\nsalt transfer coefficient should lie somewhere in the range\n35\u201370. Adopting a value at the lower end of this range,\nwe find the best fit to our observations is obtained with\nvalues of 0.0011 for Cd\n1\/2GT and 3.1 3 10\n25 for Cd\n1\/2GS.\nFor a ratio at the upper end the values become 0.0016\nand 2.2 3 1025. For a drag coefficient of 0.0097, these\nvalues imply a heat transfer coefficient in the range\n0.011\u20130.016 and a salt transfer coefficient in the range\n3.1 3 1024\u20132.2 3 1024.\n6. Discussion and recommendations\nWe have described a unique set of observations made\ndeep in the interior of the Ronne Ice Shelf that have\nenabled us for the first time to test quantitatively a num-\nber of parameterizations of turbulent scalar fluxes through\nthe ice\u2013ocean boundary layer. Such parameterizations lie\nat the heart of all models of ocean circulation beneath\nice shelves, as the phase changes that result represent\none of the most important forcings on the circulation. If\na parameterization gives an incorrect ablation rate, it is\nunlikely that the resulting circulation will be correct,\nunless there is a fortuitous, compensating error in some\nother part of the model.\nUp to three turbulence closure parameters are required,\nnamely the drag coefficient and the heat and salt transfer\ncoefficients. We have evaluated the various choices that\nhave been made for these parameters in the subice shelf\nenvironment to date. We find that two out of the three\nformulations that have been used can reproduce the ob-\nserved ablation rate to within 50%. While the parame-\nterization of Jenkins (1991) can readily be tuned to match\nthe observations, we have no evidence to justify the level\nof complexity involved in the expressions for the turbu-\nlent transfer coefficients. We have therefore followed the\nalternative strategy of McPhee et al. (2008) and chosen\nconstant values for the turbulent transfer coefficients that\nbest fit our observations. In practice, the more complex\nexpressions for the coefficients (McPhee et al. 1987;\nJenkins 1991) tend to yield nearly constant values under\nmost conditions because of the dominance of molecular\ndiffusion within the interfacial sublayer over turbulent\ndiffusion within the surface and outer layers in determin-\ning the heat and salt profiles through the boundary layer.\nIndeed, the ratio of heat to salt transfer coefficients sug-\ngested byMcPhee et al. (2008) comes from an assumption\nthat the temperature and salinity at the outer edge of the\ninterfacial sublayer are effectively equal to far-field values.\nAlthough we have several observations of the ablation\nrate, the relative uniformity of the oceanographic condi-\ntions on averagemeans thatwe canonly determine the best\nchoice for one parameter independently. We have there-\nfore given combinations of drag and turbulent transfer\ncoefficients (i.e., conventional Stanton numbers) that best\nrepresent conditions at our study site and made use of\nthe theoretical ratio of heat to salt transfer coefficients\nto provide appropriate values for use in Eqs. (1) and (5).\nBased on the observations reported here, our overall\nrecommendation for the calculation of the ablation rate\nat the base of an ice shelf is to use either Eqs. (1), (3), (4),\nand (5) or Eqs. (3), (4), and (6) with values for the tur-\nbulence closure parameters given in Table 2. The mean\nablation rates obtained by applying these recommended\nformulations over the periods of the observations and\nusing the temperature of the upper thermistor are shown\nin Table 3. We have no evidence from our single study\nsite that favors one formulation over the other, but we\nwould anticipate that an explicit treatment of salt\ntransfer through the boundary layer would be applicable\nfor a broader range of oceanographic conditions and ice\nshelf ablation rates.\nIf either formulation is used in an ocean model that\ndoes not simulate the tidal currents, a potentially sig-\nnificant contribution to the interfacial friction velocity\nwill be missing. In this case a modified version of Eq. (3)\ncould be used:\nu2*5Cd(U\n21 hU2Ti), (10)\nTABLE 2.

The mean-square\ntidal velocity would ideally be a spatially varying quan-\ntity based on the results of a tidal model, but, if such\ninformation were not available, a constant value based\non the likely tidal current magnitude for the ice shelf in\nquestion could be adopted. In a region of high tidal\ncurrents and low temperature this latter strategy would\nbe tantamount to choosing constant turbulent transfer\nvelocities, as used in some of the formulations discussed\nin section 2. However, adopting this slightly more\ncomplex strategy would ensure that the chosen transfer\ncoefficients were based in a quantitative fashion on an\nestimate of the intensity of the primary source of turbu-\nlent kinetic energy. Table 4 gives values for gT,S (u*GT,S)\nand gfTSg(u*GfTSg) for a number of root-mean-square\ntidal currents, based on the assumption that the tides\nare the only source of energy for mixing. For the lower\nvalues, ignoring the mean flow could overlook a signifi-\ncant additional contribution to the total energy available\nfor mixing, and the inclusion of the time-mean flow speed\nin Eqs. (1), (5), and (6) is critical to the recovery of the\nnonlinear response of ice shelf ablation to changes in the\nfar-field ocean temperature discussed by P. R. Holland\net al. (2008). For these reasons the use of constant tur-\nbulent transfer velocities is not recommended, and the\nvalues in Table 4 are given primarily for the purposes of\ncomparison with earlier studies.\nAlthough we have included an explicit value for the\ndrag coefficient in our list of recommendations in Table 2,\nwe urge caution in its use. The value has been inferred\nfrom a study of scalar, rather than momentum, transfer\nthrough the ice\u2013ocean boundary layer and has been cho-\nsen such that the turbulent transfer coefficients for sca-\nlars are consistent with those recommended by McPhee\net al. (2008) for sea ice. While we have no evidence to\nsuggest that the sea ice results should not be directly\napplicable to an ice shelf, we note that the parameteri-\nzations discussed in section 2 have been derived from\ntheory that assumes a fully developed, steady bound-\nary layer. The temperature records shown in Fig. 3 in-\ndicate a high degree of variability, some of which must\nbe associated with temporal evolution of the boundary\nlayer. An inevitable result of our model fitting procedure\nis that any deficiencies in the theory will have been ab-\nsorbed into the tuning of the drag coefficient.\nIn models where the vertical resolution is sufficient\nto resolve the surface layer, some care is required in the\nchoice of variable to input to the parameterization of\nthe turbulent fluxes. Values from the closest grid point\nto the boundary may not be the most appropriate. This\nis particularly true of velocity, where the free stream\ncurrent beyond the boundary layer is required for the\ndrag law in Eqs. (3) and (10). In practice, the interfacial\nsublayer is unlikely to be resolved, so temperature and\nsalinity from the grid point closest to the boundary might\nwell be the best choice, but it should be far enough from\nthe ice shelf base to sample conditions in the well-mixed\npart of the boundary layer.\n7. Summary\nThe observations reported in this paper represent the\nfirst and, as yet, only opportunity to verify the parame-\nterizations of turbulent scalar transfer used to diagnose\nablation at the base of ice shelves in ocean circulation\nmodels. Based on this single observational dataset and\nour expectation of the level of complexity needed under\nmore extreme thermal forcing, the best parameteriza-\ntion would appear to be a three-equation formulation of\nthe form\nr\ni\na\nb\nL\ni\n5 r\ni\nc\ni\na\nb\n(T\ni\n\u0002 T\nb\n)\u0002 r\nw\nc\nw\nu*GT(Tb \u0002 Tw),\n(11)\nr\ni\na\nb\n(S\nb\n\u0002 S\ni\n)5\u0002r\nw\nu*GS(Sb \u0002 Sw), (12)\nand\nT\nb\n5 l\n1\nS\nb\n1 l\n2\n1 l\n3\nP\nb\n(13)\nwith turbulent transfer coefficients taken from Table 2.\nIn Eq. (11) the heat conduction into the ice shelf (first\nterm on the right-hand side) has been parameterized\nfollowing N\u00f8st and Foldvik (1994) and Holland and\nJenkins (1999) because the basal temperature gradient\nwithin the ice shelf is unknown in a stand-alone ocean\nmodel. In coupled ice shelf\u2013ocean models it would be\npreferable to retain the exact form in Eq. (1).\nWhile a three-equation formulation is generally to be\npreferred, owing to its potentially wider applicability, it\ndoes produce a quadratic equation for the ablation rate.\nLinearization of this system could be an advantage in\nreduced or analytical models, in which case the two-\nequation formulation,\nr\ni\na\nb\nL\ni\n5 r\ni\nc\ni\na\nb\n(T\ni\n\u0002 T\nf\n)\u0002 r\nw\nc\nw\nu*G TSf g(T f \u0002 Tw)\n(14)\nTABLE 4.

We reemphasize that use of this simpler\nformulation results in no degradation in the fit between\ncalculated and observed ablation rates for our limited\nset of measurements.\nIn both cases the friction velocity is calculated as in Eq.\n(3) or (10), depending on the treatment of tidal currents,\nwith the drag coefficient taken from Table 2. The drag\ncoefficient is the parameter in Table 2 that is least well\nconstrained by independent observational evidence. Ad-\njustment of its value has therefore been the primary\nmeans of tuning the above equations to replicate the ob-\nservations. Use of this value thus entails the implicit as-\nsumptions that the theory presented in section 2 is exact\nand that the turbulent transfer coefficients estimated for\nsea ice are appropriate for the base of an ice shelf. Tem-\nporal variability of the boundary layer and the differing\nnature of the boundary flow beneath ice shelves, where\nthe forcing comes from buoyancy and tides, and beneath\nsea ice, where the primary forcing is the wind-driven drift\nof the ice cover, could violate these assumptions.\nIn the absence of further observations, the above equa-\ntions represent the optimal choice for models of the ocean\ncirculation beneath ice shelves. However, there can be\nlittle doubt that further observations could lead to sig-\nnificant improvements, particularly if those observations\ncould sample a broad range of basal roughness char-\nacteristics, water temperatures, and tidal regimes. Direct\nmeasurements of turbulent fluxes through an evolving\nboundary layer are also crucial to ensure that parame-\nter tuning is not used to compensate for theoretical de-\nficiencies.\nAcknowledgments.
