INTRODUCTION\nArrays of coupled oscillators are ubiquitous in nature and technology.1 The theory of coupled oscillators has\nbeen applied to arrays of lasers, Josephson junctions and to the explanation of phenomena related to biological\nrhythms.2\nMany papers have been dedicated to the synchronization effect.3 This occurs when the coupling strength\nexceeds a certain critical value. In this case, the amplitudes are not affected. For stronger couplings the\namplitude dynamics is very important and new phenomena can occur. Among these phenomena there is the\nso\u2013called \u201camplitude death\u201d or \u201coscillation death\u201d4\u20137 , in which the oscillators can collapse to a state of zero\namplitude.\nRecently there has been a wealth of work dedicated to oscillation death and similar phenomena in many different\nsystems.8\u201312\nIn the present paper we investigate a mathematical model of the cardiovascular system based on an array\nof coupled oscillators. The basic unit in the model is an oscillator that possesses some mathematical features\nmotivated by physiological understanding and by the analysis of measured time series13, 14 .

However, in previous papers15 , the addition of noise was necessary for the explanation of\nthe variability of cardiac and respiratory frequencies. Our results show that heart-rate variability can have a\nnew deterministic explanation. Using techniques of dynamical systems theory, we show that the frequencies\nof the cardiac and respiratory oscillators can experience variabilities very similar to those observed in real\nmeasurements. The intrinsic dynamics of the cardiovascular system is controlled by deterministic coupling\nbetween the physiological oscillators and without any need to add external noise.\nWe also show that the phenomenon of oscillation death can occur in the model of cardiovascular system.\nMoreover, the mechanism leading to the quenching of the oscillators can be controlled, not only by the coupling\nparameters, but by a more general scheme. In fact, we propose that a change in the relative current state of\nthe cardiovascular oscillators can lead to a cessation of the oscillations without actually changing the strength\nof the coupling among them. Furthermore, we show that the bifurcation route to oscillation death in our system\ncan produce different non\u2013zero fixed points. Hence, the oscillators can stop beating but actually keeping certain\nconstant non\u2013zero amplitude. We discuss also the results of real experiments using electronic oscillators.\n2. PRESENTATION OF THE MODEL\nThe model of the cardiovascular system is based on a system of five coupled oscillators13, 14 . Their physiological\nfunctions are the following: the heart, respiration, myogenic activity, neurogenic activity and endothelial related\nmetabolic activity. The basic unit in the model is the Poincare\u00b4 oscillator:\nx\u02d9i = \u2212xiqi \u2212 yi\u03c9i + Pi(X,Y)\ny\u02d9i = \u2212yiqi + xi\u03c9i +Qi(X,Y),\n(1)\nwhere qi = \u03b1i\n(\u221a\n(x2i + y\n2\ni )\u2212 ai\n)\n, ai, \u03c9i = 2\u03c0fi and \u03b1i are constant parameters, and Pi(X,Y) and Qi(X,Y)\nare coupling terms.\n3. OSCILLATION DEATH\n3.1. Theoretical Background\nIn this section we will consider that the interaction between the oscillators is a mean field term:\nPi(X,Y) =\n\u2211\nxj ,\nQi(X,Y) = 0.\n(2)\nLet us first introduce some concepts.\nSuppose we are studying an autonomous dynamical system:\nz\u02d91 = F1(z1, z2, . . . , zn),\nz\u02d92 = F2(z1, z2, . . . , zn),\n. . .\nz\u02d9n = Fn(z1, z2, . . . , zn).\n(3)\nAll the points (in phase space) that satisfy the equations\nF1(z1, z2, . . . , zn) = 0,\nF2(z1, z2, . . . , zn) = 0,\n. . .\nFn(z1, z2, . . . , zn) = 0,\n(4)\nare called fixed points of the dynamical system (3). The stability and quality of the fixed points can be determined\nby the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix, provided their real parts are nonzero.\nGiven a fixed point Z0 = (z01 , z\n0\n2 , . . . , z\n0\nn), the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix corresponding to this fixed\npoint can be calculated from the equation:\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2202F1(Z\n0)\n\u2202z1\n\u2212 \u03bb \u2202F1(Z\n0)\n\u2202z2\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2202F1(Z\n0)\n\u2202zn\n\u2202F2(Z\n0)\n\u2202z1\n\u2202F2(Z\n0)\n\u2202z1\n\u2212 \u03bb \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202F2(Z\n0)\n\u2202zn\n...\n...\n...\n\u2202Fn(Z\n0)\n\u2202z1\n\u2202Fn(Z\n0)\n\u2202z2\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2202Fn(Z\n0)\n\u2202zn\n\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n= 0. (5)\n3.2. Two Oscillators\nx\u02d91 = \u2212x1\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx21 + y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1)\u2212 y1\u03c91 + \u01eb(x1 + x2),\ny\u02d91 = \u2212y1\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx21 + y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1) + x1\u03c91,\nx\u02d92 = \u2212x2\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx22 + y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2)\u2212 y2\u03c92 + \u01eb(x1 + x2),\ny\u02d92 = \u2212y2\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx22 + y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2) + x2\u03c92.\n(6)\nThe point (0, 0, 0, 0) is always a fixed point. For \u01eb = 0, this point is unstable (focus or node). Besides this\nfixed point, there is the well\u2013known stable limit cycle, which is the reason why this system can be considered an\noscillator model. The eigenvalues corresponding to this fixed point when \u01eb 6= 0 can be calculated using equation\n(5): \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(\u03b1a1 + \u01eb)\u2212 \u03bb \u2212\u03c91 \u01eb 0\n\u03c91 \u03b1a1 \u2212 \u03bb 0 0\n\u01eb 0 (\u03b1a2 + \u01eb)\u2212 \u03bb \u2212\u03c92\n0 0 \u03c92 \u03b1a2 \u2212 \u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n= 0. (7)\nThe origin can become a stable fixed point and the limit cycle does not exist anymore if the following conditions\nare satisfied:\n2\u03b1a1 + \u01eb < 0,\n2\u03b1a2 + \u01eb < 0,\n(8)\nFor instance, if a2 > a1, then the condition \u01eb < \u22122\u03b1a2 is sufficient for the amplitude death to occur.\nWhen \u01eb > 0, there is a critical value \u01ebc such that, for \u01eb > \u01ebc, four new fixed points can appear: two unstable\nand two asymptotically stable. The Fig. 1 shows the bifurcation diagram for the four variables x1, y1, x2, y2.\nNotice that the origin is always an unstable fixed point. The end of the oscillations is marked by the appearance\nof the new fixed points at \u01eb \u223c 3.578.\nThe new fixed points are obtained from the set of algebraic equations.\n\u2212x1\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx21 + y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1)\u2212 y1\u03c91 + \u01eb(x1 + x2) = 0,\n\u2212y1\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx21 + y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1) + x1\u03c91 = 0,\n\u2212x2\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx22 + y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2)\u2212 y2\u03c92 + \u01eb(x1 + x2) = 0,\n\u2212y2\u03b1(\n\u221a\nx22 + y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2) + x2\u03c92 = 0.\n(9)\nAfter some algebra, we get the relations:\n\u03c91(x\n2\n1 + y\n2\n1) = \u01eby1(x1 + x2),\n\u03c92(x\n2\n2 + y\n2\n2) = \u01eby2(x1 + x2).\n(10)\n3.5 3.52 3.54 3.56 3.58 3.6\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n3.5 3.52 3.54 3.56 3.58 3.6\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n3.5 3.52 3.54 3.56 3.58 3.6\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3.5 3.52 3.54 3.56 3.58 3.6\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nX1 X2\nY1 Y2\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\u03ba\n\u03ba\n**\n**\nFigure 1. Bifurcation diagram that shows the appearance of new equilibria and their stability. The dashed lines corre-\nspond to unstable fixed points, while the continuous line depicts stable ones.\nAnalysis of Eq. (10) combined with Eq. (9) shows that, for \u01eb \u226a 2\u03c91 and \u01eb \u226a 2\u03c92, the only fixed point is\n(0, 0, 0, 0). For sufficiently large values of \u01eb, we obtain four new fixed points. The fixed points can appear only\nin pairs of stable\u2013unstable points.\nWe now define x1 = r1 cos (\u03a61), y1 = r1 sin (\u03a61), x2 = r2 cos (\u03a62), y2 = r2 sin (\u03a62), where r\n2\n1 = x\n2\n1 + y\n2\n1 ,\nr22 = x\n2\n2 + y\n2\n2 .\nAs in our model \u03c91 \u226b \u03c92, a2 > a1, which implies (x\n0\n1)\n2 \u226a (x02)\n2, from Eq (10) we obtain the equality:\n\u03c92 = \u01eb cos (\u03a62) sin (\u03a62). (11)\nThis is equivalent to the equation:\n2\u03c92\n\u01eb\n= sin (2\u03a62). (12)\nAs sin (2\u03a62) \u2264 1, this means that we have new solutions to the algebraic equations (9) only when\n\u01eb > 2\u03c92. (13)\nEq. (13) can give us a simple (and understandable) analytic estimate of the critical value for the bifurcation.\nFig. 2 shows a numerical simulation of the coupled oscillators (6). We can see how the oscillations evolve as \u01eb\nis being increased by steps of 0.1. In this way we have determined that, for the chosen values of the parameters,\nthe oscillations die off for \u01ebc \u223c 3.58. We should compare this value with that obtained with the theoretical\ncondition (13), from where we get \u01ebc \u2248 4\u03c0f2 = 3.77. Both critical values are remarkably close, differing by a\n0 20 40 60 80\nt(s)\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nx\n1(t\n), x\n2(t\n), \u03b5\nFigure 2. Time series of x1(t) (bold curve) and x2(t) from numerical simulations of the system (6). The parameters\nwere: f1 = 1.1, f2 = 0.3, a1 = 0.5, a2 = 1.0, \u03b11 = 1 and \u03b12 = 1. The dashed line shows the step\u2013wise variation of the\ncoupling constant \u01eb.\nsmall error accounted for by the assumptions of difference in order of magnitude of the natural frequencies in\nthe system.\nUsing the same values of parameters as above, we also performed numerical simulations for negative \u01eb, and\nfound that oscillation death occurs for \u01eb \u223c \u22122, which agrees very well with the theoretical prediction (8).\n3.3. Five Oscillators\n3.3.1. Numerical Simulations\nWe have investigated numerically the algebraic equations\n\u2212xiqi \u2212 yi\u03c9i + \u01eb\n\u2211\nxj = 0\n\u2212yiqi + xi\u03c9i = 0,\n(14)\nwhere qi = \u03b1i\n(\u221a\n(x2i + y\n2\ni )\u2212 ai\n)\n, i = 1, . . . , 5. The solutions to these algebraic equations correspond to the fixed\npoints of the dynamical system (1) when we have five coupled oscillators. We have found that, for sufficiently\nlarge values of \u01eb, the system possesses four additional fixed points (two stable and two unstable) as in the case\nof two coupled oscillators.\nFor instance, for \u01eb = 0.52, the stable fixed points of the dynamical system are the following:\nx\u22171 = 0.022530 x\n\u2217\n2 = 1.198176 x\n\u2217\n3 = 2.550139 x\n\u2217\n4 = 2.761457 x\n\u2217\n5 = 2.489791\ny\u22171 = 0.717314 y\n\u2217\n2 = 1.861161 y\n\u2217\n3 = 0.933874 y\n\u2217\n4 = 0.292930 y\n\u2217\n5 = 0.078571\n(15)\nThe points (15), and their negative symmetrical counterparts are asymptotically stable. These are the new\nattractors of the dynamical system, while the origin continues to be an unstable equilibrium. The calculation\nof the fixed point (15) is not a simulation. We have used the computer only as a means calculate of the values\nof the variables that are solutions to the algebraic equations (14). The concept of asymptotically stable fixed\npoints is part of the theoretical understanding of the system.\nWe have also simulated the dynamics of the system for the given parameter values. The result of the\nsimulation is that the phase trajectories are attracted to the asymptotically stable fixed points (see Fig. 3(A)).\nThis is a manifestation of the phenomenon known as oscillation death.\nFigure 3. Top diagram: equivalent electronic circuit of a single Poincare\u00b4 Oscillator (1). Time series (A), shows five\nfunctions (x1(t), . . . , x5(t)) as \u01eb (bold steps) is increased, in the numerical simulation of system (14). Time series (B),\nshows the signal x1(t) in the experiments with five coupled oscillator circuits.\n3.3.2. Real Experiments\nWe performed experiments with analogue electronic circuits that show the phenomenon of oscillation death. The\ndiagram of the circuit equivalent to the basic oscillator with equation (1), can be seen in the top picture of Fig. 3.\nThe blocks labeled F (\u2217) implement the nonlinear functions F (x, y) = x10\n\u221a\nx2 + y2, and F \u2032(x, y) = y10\n\u221a\nx2 + y2.\nIn our experiments we coupled five of these Poincare\u00b4 oscillator circuits using the mean field coupling approach.\nThe result of the experiments are shown for x1(t) in the time series (B) of Fig. 3. For comparison in the\nsame figure, the time series (A), shows the numerical simulations of the same system of five coupled oscillators.\nIn both figures we can clearly see the collapse of the oscillations to some non\u2013zero constant values, when the\ncoupling intensity \u01eb reaches a critical value.\nThis demonstrates that oscillation death is a robust dynamical phenomenon that can be appreciated in real\nsystems, when the conditions necessary for its manifestation are met.\n4. FREQUENCY VARIABILITY IN THE COUPLED OSCILLATORS\nIn this section we will investigate several phase equations in order to get some insight on the frequency variability\nof nonlinear oscillators. We believe phase dynamics is the key approach to understand frequency variability.\nFirst we will study some non\u2013autonomous phase equations as the following:\n\u03a6\u02d9 = \u03c90 + F (t). (16)\nThese equations can be solved exactly:\n\u03a6(t) = \u03a60 + \u03c90t+\n\u222b t\n0\nF (\u03c4)d\u03c4 . (17)\nWe will use different functions for the perturbation F (t). The simplest case is that with no perturbation at all:\nF1(t) = 0 (18)\nThen we will analyze the case of periodic perturbation.\nF2(t) = \u01eb cos (\u03c9t), (19)\nand quasiperiodic perturbation:\nF3(t) = \u01eb(a1 cos (\u03c91t) + a2 cos (\u03c92t) + a3 cos (\u03c93t)). (20)\nThe following function\nF4(t) = \u01eb sin (B1 sinh (a1 cos (\u03c91t) + a2 cos (\u03c92t)) +B2 cosh (a3 cos (\u03c93t) + a4 cos (\u03c94t))), (21)\nhas been shown recently to behave as a chaotic perturbation with some properties that resemble white noise.16\nFinally, for F (t) in Eq. (16) we will use the dynamics produced by a chaotic system:\nF5(t) = \u01ebX1(t), (22)\nwhere X1 is a component of the chaotic Lorenz system:\nX\u02d91 = 10(X2\u2212X1),\nX\u02d92 = 28X1 \u2212X2 \u2212X1X3,\nX\u02d93 = X1X2 \u2212 (8\/3)X3.\n(23)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n-1\n0\n1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n-1\n0\n1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n-1\n0\n1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n-1\n0\n1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nt(s)\n-1\n0\n1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nf(Hz)\n10-4\n10-2\n100\nF1\nF2\nF3\nF4\nF5\nTIME SERIES: X(t) FFT\nFigure 4.

(22) corresponds to a chaotic perturbation with a power\u2013law spectrum.\nOur cardiovascular model consists of a system of coupled autonomous oscillators. This model can be repre-\nsented by the phase dynamics of some general autonomous dynamical systems, that describe their behavior. We\nnow study some examples of these systems.\nIn general, the phase dynamics of an autonomous dynamical system can be described by a set of equations\nas the following:\n\u03a6\u02d91 = \u03c91 + \u01eb1Q1(\u03a61, . . . ,\u03a6n),\n\u03a6\u02d92 = \u03c92 + \u01eb2Q2(\u03a61, . . . ,\u03a6n),\n...\n\u03a6\u02d9n = \u03c9n + \u01ebnQn(\u03a61, . . . ,\u03a6n),\n(24)\nHowever, sometimes a system like that given by Eq. (24) can be coupled to the amplitude dynamics of other\ndynamical systems.\nLet us introduce the following set of equations that describe the phase dynamics of an autonomous dynamical\n0 1 2 3 4 510\n-4\n10-2\n100\n0 1 2 3 4 510\n-4\n10-2\n100\n0 1 2 3 4 510\n-4\n10-2\n100\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nf(Hz)\n10-4\n10-2\n100\nFourier Spectra\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 5.

(16) with F (t) as defined in Eq. (20). Thus, the frequency variability shown\nin Fig. 4 with perturbation F3(t) is the same as that obtained using the autonomous dynamical system (25).\nWe have also investigated other dynamical systems. The variability in the frequency of X1(t) = sin (\u03a61(t))\ngenerated by the dynamical system:\n\u03a6\u02d91 = \u03c91 + \u01eb(A2 sin\u03a62 +A3 sin\u03a63 +A4 sin\u03a64) +B2(A5 sin\u03a65),\n\u03a6\u02d92 = \u03c92,\n\u03a6\u02d93 = \u03c93,\n\u03a6\u02d94 = \u03c94,\n\u03a6\u02d95 = \u03c95,\n(26)\nis shown in Fig. 5(a).\nThe next dynamical system possesses a chaotic (Lorenz) subsystem:\n\u03a6\u02d91 = \u03c91 + \u01ebX2 +BA5 sin\u03a65,\nX\u02d92 = 10(X3\u2212X2),\nX\u02d93 = 28X2 \u2212X3 \u2212X2X4,\nX\u02d94 = X2X3 \u2212 (8\/3)X4,\n\u03a6\u02d95 = \u03c95,\n(27)\nwhere X1(t) = sin (\u03a61(t)). The effect on its spectrum can be seen in Fig. 5(b).\nAnother example of an oscillator system coupled to a chaotic (Duffing) system is the following:\nX\u02d91 = X2\nX\u02d92 = \u2212\u03b3X2 +X1 \u2212X\n3\n1 + f0 sin\u03a63,\n\u03a6\u02d93 = \u03c93,\n\u03a6\u02d94 = \u03c94 + \u01eb1X1,\n\u03a6\u02d95 = \u03c95,\n\u03a6\u02d96 = \u03c96 + \u01eb2(A3 sin\u03a63 +A4 sin\u03a64 +A5 sin\u03a65),\n(28)\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.25, \u03c93 = 1 and f0 = 0.3. The spectrum of X4(t) = sin (\u03a64(t)) is depicted in Fig. 5(c), and that of\nX6(t) = sin (\u03a66(t)) in Fig. 5(d).\nWe have investigated several systems of type (24) that represent coupled oscillators models. The simple fact\nthat the oscillators are coupled does not always lead to frequency variability like that shown in cardiovascular\ndynamics. Not even the fact that the coupling generates chaos is sufficient for explaining the frequency variability.\nSome examples of the investigated time series are shown in Fig. 5.\nWe believe the coupling of 4 or 5 oscillators is needed for observing the CVS frequency variability. The\nrelationship between the frequencies is important. If the system is not chaotic, the influence of 3 or more\noscillators on the cardiac oscillators is necessary. The coupling needs both linear and nonlinear terms. If a\nsubsystem of the model is chaotic, the coupling of the cardiac oscillator with the chaotic system can produce the\nfrequency variability, provided that the Fourier spectrum of the chaotic system possesses the right properties.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated a model of the cardiovascular system based on a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.\nWe have demonstrated that different mechanisms are possible for the explanation of actual pathological or\nnormal physiological behavior. For instance, sudden cardiac death or disease\u2013induced changes in HRV can be\nexplained in a deterministic way inside the framework of this model.\nWe have used theoretical and numerical techniques, and analogue electronic experiments as well. We have\nfound that the phenomenon of oscillation death can occur in this model. There are two mechanisms for this\neffect. When the coupling strength \u01eb is negative and is smaller than some critical value, amplitude death can\noccur. The zero\u2013amplitude fixed point becomes asymptotically stable and the oscillations die to zero. This is a\nHopf bifurcation scenario, in which the frequency of the oscillations remains almost constant while the amplitude\nslowly vanishes to zero.\nIn the second case, oscillation death happens when in the coupled system new fixed points appear in the\nplace of the limit cycle, after \u01eb has surpassed a positive threshold. In this case, the amplitude remains almost\nconstant wile the frequency slowly vanishes to zero. This case corresponds to a saddle\u2013node bifurcation, and is\nthe scenario more likely to occur in actual coupled physiological oscillators.\nThe discussion of oscillation death is usually focused on the strength of the coupling coefficient. The common\nphrase is that \u201cfor large couplings, amplitude death will take place\u201d. However, once we have an analytical\nexpression for the critical value (which will depend on other parameters), then we can predict the phenomenon\nwhen different parameter relations are changed.\nFor instance, the analytical conditions given by Eq. (8) for oscillation death indicates that if the \u201camplitude\u201d\nparameters a1 and a2 are decreased (in fact it is sufficient to decrease the largest of these parameters), the\namplitude death can occur even if the coupling coefficient is fixed. The same can happen if the \u201cexcitability\u201d\nparameter \u03b1 is decreased beyond some critical value.\nAnother mechanism is the following. If \u01eb > 0, and \u01eb > \u01ebc, new asymptotically stable fixed points can appear.\nIn this case, the oscillations die but the dynamical variables can take non\u2013zero asymptotic values. We should\nremark that the critical value \u01ebc depends on the frequency of the second oscillator (in this case it is the lowest\nfrequency). That is, even if we fix the coupling strength \u01eb, if the frequency of one of the oscillators is less than\nsome critical value, then the oscillators can stop dead.\nThese results could be applied in areas from high technology electronics to research on heart attacks.\nFor instance, the phenomena related to sudden cardiac death or the pathologies produced by aging could\nbe explained by effects like these. Furthermore, these findings could suggest that some medications or medical\ntreatments that lead to changes in the parameters \u03b1, ai or \u03c9i, could reanimate a person in whom cardiac\noscillation death has occurred.\nRecently some authors8 have speculated that death by delay might be involved in arrhythmias of the cardiac\npacemaker network. However, other authors17 suggested that this is impossible because the propagation delays\nare too short in these networks. However, the oscillation death produced by changes in parameters of the coupled\noscillators of the whole cardiovascular system seem very probable. For instance, according to our results, changes\nin the respiratory frequency could affect the cardiac oscillator.\nThese results could be applicable also in coupled arrays of neurons in the brain.\nIn the second part of the paper, we have investigated frequency variability in coupled oscillators. First we\nhave shown that if the phase dynamics is forced by quasiperiodic or chaotic perturbations, frequency variability\nvery similar to that observed in real measurements can be obtained.\nFurthermore, we have shown that this kind of dynamics can be generated in autonomous dynamical systems\nconsisting of coupled oscillators.\nOur investigation suggests that the coupling of 4 or 5 oscillators is needed for observing the measured CVS\nfrequency variability.\nIf a subsystem of the model possesses some chaotic behavior, the coupling of the cardiac oscillator with some\nof the chaotic variable can produce the frequency variability provided the Fourier spectrum of the chaotic variable\nsatisfy some conditions (e.g. 1\/f spectrum).\nIf the system is not chaotic, the influence of 3 or more oscillators on the cardiac oscillator is necessary.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge support by the Programme Al\u03b2an, EU, scholarship number E03D05224VE.
