Extending this view, the We-\nparadigm incorporates what became known as the social psychology of creativity. The cultural psychology of \ncreativity builds upon this last theoretical approach while being critical of some of its assumptions. This \nrelatively new perspective, using the conceptual and methodological framework of cultural psychology, \ninvestigates the sociocultural roots and dynamics of all our creative acts and employs a tetradic framework of \nself \u2013 community \u2013 new artifact \u2013 existing artifacts in its conceptualization of creativity. The theoretical basis \nof the cultural psychology approach is analyzed as well as some of its main implications for both the \nunderstanding and study of creativity. \n \nKeywords: He I and We-paradigms, Social psychology of creativity, Cultural psychology of creativity, \nVygotskian approach, Potential space, Dialogicality, Symbolic resources \n \n \nWe undoubtedly live in a world of change, a world in motion. It is change that takes place at all \nlevels, that seems to get hold of every aspect of our life and our society. We feel it in the accelerated \ndaily rhythm at work and at home, we perceive its consequences in the political and economical \ndomain and see its impact for the natural environment. This generalized sense of change often leads \nto anxiety (Negus & Pickering, 2004), to the feeling that we are not \u201cprepared\u201d, that what we \nnormally know and do doesn\u2019t work anymore. It is under these circumstances that creativity \nbecomes much more present and more important that before (Runco, 2004) and it is claimed to help \nus achieve our goals as individuals, as organizations, as societies (Westwood & Low, 2003). At the \nsame time, the aura of panacea creativity has gained pushes it more than ever under the scrutiny of \npsychologists and social scientists at large.  \n \nThe number of ways in which creativity has been theorized and the variety of domains it has been \napplied to is impressive (for reviews see Sternberg, 2003; Runco, 2004): from behavioral \napproaches linking it to reinforcement and modeling (Epstein & Laptosky, 1999) to the dominant \ncognitive approaches discussing it in terms of cognitive style (Martinsen & Kaufmann, 1999) or \nproblem solving (Weisberg, 1988). Primary areas of application for creativity theories are in \neducational settings (Cropley, 1999; Hennessey, 2003a) and organizations, especially studies of \nleadership (Mumford & Connelly, 1999) and performance in heterogeneous teams (Puccio, 1999). \n \nIn most of these areas it is the individual set apart from his\/her social context that constitutes the \nunit of analysis for creativity, an authentic bias in the literature recognized only from the \u201870s on \n(Hennessey, 2003b). Be it the \u201clone genius\u201d or the more \u201cordinary\u201d person, s\/he creates outside of \nsocial and group factors (Paulus & Nijstad, 2003) and even despite them (Weiner, 2000). Society \nand culture repeatedly act as the \u201cvillains\u201d the creator fights against and this generates a series of \nparadoxes that will be exposed further on in this article. One of them relates directly to the definition \nof creativity. \u201cNew\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d as features of a creative product (Stein, 1953; Martindale, 1994; \nRichards, 1999) are properties that easily describe the work of great creators and can be applied to \ncertain products, particularly in the field of science, art and technology, but deny the creativity of \nchildren and the varied instances of \u201cmundane creativity\u201d (Cohen & Ambrose, 1999).     \n    \nThis article aims to unpack the social and cultural nature of creative acts. In doing so I will start by \ndistinguishing between three paradigms that led creativity theory and research, the He, I and We \nparadigm (see also Gl\u0103veanu, in press). The first part will therefore focus on paradigmatic shifts \nfrom \u201cpositivistic research paradigms to more complex, constructivistic, systems-oriented research \nmodels\u201d (Friedman & Rogers, 1998, p. xviii). Nonetheless, it will be argued that even the models \nproposed within what is currently considered the social psychology of creativity, maybe \u201cthe least \ndeveloped area in creativity research\u201d (Amabile, 1996, p. 264), can still be criticized for the \nindividualism hidden behind their assumptions. Counteracting such tendencies, an emerging \nmultidisciplinary field is introduced, the cultural psychology of creativity, conceiving creativity as a \nfundamentally relational, intersubjective phenomenon.  \n \n1. Three paradigms of creativity theory and research  \n \nThe study of creativity has known three paradigmatic stages: the genius stage, the creative person \nstage and the \u201csocial\u201d stage. By making reference to historical times long before the words \n\u201ccreativeness\u201d or \u201ccreativity\u201d entered our vocabulary (for the English language this is the 18th and \n19th century respectively; see Mason, 2003; Weiner, 2000) or before psychology became a science, \nthe article will also consider centuries of pre-psychological thought concerning humans\u2019 capacity to \ncreate. Although a historical progression is implied, it is likely that \u201cinstances\u201d of these paradigms \ncoexist at different times and they are certainly intertwined in today\u2019s scientific landscape.    \n \n1.1. The He-paradigm: the lone genius \n \nThe image of the genius is probably one of the most persistent representations in human history. \nWith roots in Greek and Roman antiquity, the first links to be made were those between genius and \ndivine inspiration (Friedman & Rogers, 1998; Sternberg, 2003). Yet, the Latin origins and meaning \nof genius as a guardian spirit have changed in the following centuries (Negus & Pickering, 2004). \nOne turning point is considered by most to be the Renaissance (Montuori & Purser, 1995), when the \ninfluence of God started to be replaced by that of genetic inheritance (Dacey, 1999). This process of \nindividualization of the genius continued on two different fronts: arts and the exaltation of \n \n2\nimagination during Romanticism and sciences and the exaltation of reason during Enlightenment \n(Weiner, 2000). Embracing such ideas about unique individuals, the He-paradigm, or the paradigm \nof the genius, has put considerable emphasis in describing creators on two main features: exclusivity \nand disconnection. Creativity is from this perspective \u201cexclusivist\u201d because only few are chosen for \nit (initially by God, later on by their biology), and the very few that are must, as a prerequisite, stand \napart from the masses because of their capacities. They create ex-nihilo (Negus & Pickering, 2004) \nand therefore need nothing to tie them up to the world of others or existing knowledge. The He-\nparadigm, (\u201cHe\u201d since the creator is most often a male other), thus takes the strongest individualistic \nstance in the conceptualization of creativity.   \n \nUndoubtedly the father-figure of the \u201cmodern\u201d He-paradigm, Francis Galton offered the world \nthrough his 1869 \u201cHereditary Genius\u201d the first scientific study of the creative genius (Simonton, \n2003). His assumption was that in the \u201ccompetition between nature and nurture\u201d, when all \nconditions are equal, \u201cnature certainly proves the stronger of the two\u201d (Galton, 1874, p. 16). By this \nGalton took genius out of the mists of the supernatural and gave it a solid basis: human biology. He \nalso described it in terms of intellectual ability and eminence (Terman, 1947\/1970). While \nintellectual ability has to do with the creator\u2019s individual brain, there is a factor of social reputation \nin appreciating eminence. Nevertheless, the connection to the world of previous knowledge and the \nscientific (or artistic) communities is not understood here as interdependence but as the mere effect \nof the genius on the existing social and cultural structures. Therefore, creativity in this paradigm \nrefers strictly to the highest levels of creation, or what is known as historical creativity (Boden, \n1994; Fischer et al., 2005). The only things worthy of being called creative are those that introduce \nnovelties, that generate new schools of thought, and constitute landmarks in the history of a domain, \nsometimes even the history of humanity.  \n \nThis represents the main limitation but also the main attraction of the He-paradigm. By glorying \ncreative breakthroughs it makes creativity stand among the most desirable human capacities, \nhowever at the price of cutting off ordinary creativity (Bateson, 1999) and common creative \nexperiences (Stein, 1953). Its focus has traditionally been on the study of the Great Man, especially \neminent scientists, and this branch of investigation has only grown in the last decades (although the \nemphasis on the biological basis of genius was not always kept). Examples are found in the work of \nRoe (1952\/1970) who examined eminent US scientists to build an \u201caverage\u201d profile of their \ncharacteristics. The studies of Gardner (1994) on seven \u201ccreators of the modern era\u201d, each taken as \nan embodiment of a certain types of intelligence, have led to similar descriptions of the \npsychological profile and life-path of Exemplary Creators. But researches on scientific genius soon \nstarted to be questioned for their implicit assumptions. In such a critical enterprise, Schaffer (1994) \nargued against the mythologies of the genius or what she calls the \u201cculture hero\u201d and the \u201cfetishism\u201d \nof discovery. Both scientific discoveries and their authors are \u201cmade up\u201d or socially constructed by \nsubsequent generations through processes of retrospection and celebration.  \n \nIn concluding, the He-paradigm, based on the individuality, insight, outstanding ability and fertility \nof the genius (Mason, 2003), gives an elitist and essentialist account of creativity (Negus & \n \n3\nPickering, 2004). The direct consequence of this is that it detaches the creator from community and, \nby this, ends up building a pathological image of him\/her. As Montuori and Purser (1995, p. 76) \nargue, the fate of the genius is often represented as that of a person who is misunderstood, eccentric \nand even anti-social. Such an account also excludes the role of co-creation or collaboration in the \nprocess of reaching \u201cgreat discoveries\u201d (Barron, 1999). Its implications go above the scientific and \nalso reach the ideological since recognizing or not the \u201cgenius\u201d is often a highly politically-charged \naction (Negus & Pickering, 2004). In the end, it rarely is creativity alone that decides who is a \ngenius but institutional structures reflecting power relations between and within social groups.     \n \n1.2. The I-paradigm: the creative person \n  \nIf the He-paradigm has deep roots in pre-psychological thought, the I-paradigm largely emerged \nonce psychologists started to focus on creativity. Put simply, the paradigmatic shift replaced the \ngenius with the \u201cnormal\u201d person while keeping the individual as a unit of analysis. It is what can be \nreferred to as a \u201cdemocratization\u201d of creativity (Bilton, 2007; Hulbeck, 1945; Weiner, 2000). \nEveryone is capable of being creative since it is no longer a capacity of the few chosen by God, \nbiology or unique psychological features. With this shift, the use of the term genius declined leaving \nspace for notions like gifted and creative (Friedman & Rogers, 1998). The birth of the I-paradigm \nand its new terminology was affected by forces working from within the field of psychology and \nalso from the outside: the socio-political context in the US after the Second World War.    \n  \n\u201cIn the presence of the Russian threat, \u2018creativity\u2019 could no longer be left to the chance \noccurrences of the genius; neither could it be left in the realm of the wholly mysterious and \nthe untouchable. Men had to be able to do something about it; creativity had to be a property \nin many men; it had to be something identifiable; it had to be subject to the effects of efforts \nto gain more of it\u201d (Razik, 1967\/1970, p. 156). \n \nIt was the background of an individualistic society that gave the perfect context for the emergence of \nthe I-paradigm. As shown by Slater (1991), the Individual versus Society worldview is predominant \nin America. This myth is associated with the dream of escaping the influence of the outside society \nand culture seen as entities one can connect to and disconnect from (p. 154).  \n \nIn psychology the voice behind the I-paradigm was that of Guilford, remembered here for his \nhistorical APA presidential address in 1950. While calling the attention of psychologists to the topic \nof creativity, he also gave them a clear agenda: \u201cthe psychologist\u2019s problem is that of creative \npersonality\u201d (p.  444) and \u201ccreative acts can therefore be expected, no matter how feeble or how \ninfrequent, of almost all individuals\u201d (p. 446). And Guilford\u2019s message was heard; for the following \ndecades psychologists looked intensively for the personal attributes of individuals (personality, \nintelligence, etc.) and their link to creativity (Amabile, 1996). \n \n \n4\nUnsurprisingly then, in 1981, when Barron and Harrington published a review of creativity studies, \nthey offered it the title \u201cCreativity, intelligence, and personality\u201d.  More recent literature argues that \nintelligence is not a sufficient condition for creativity (Eysenck, 1994) and therefore intelligent \npersons are not necessarily creative as well. Nevertheless, intelligence and creativity overlap in \nsome respects but not in others (Sternberg, 1999). One hypothesis may be that, instead of a single \noutstanding intelligence, the creative person is described by an unusual combination of intelligences \n(Gardner, 1994). Studies of the creative personality on the other hand proved to be an even more \nfertile tradition. Among the most common traits encountered were: tolerance for ambiguity and \norientation towards the future (Stein, 1953), independence of judgment, preference for complexity, \nstrong desire to create, deep motivation, lots of personal troubles, strong intuitive nature and \npatience (Barron, 1999), relatively high intelligence, originality, articulateness and verbal fluency, \nand a good imagination (Tardif & Sternberg, 1988). Finally, also within the I-paradigm, a special \nclass of studies locates creativity not in the individual\u2019s personality but in his\/her unconscious and \nacts of sublimation (see Freud, 1908\/1970; Noppe, 1999), or even in pathology (see Storr, 1972; \nEysenck, 1994; Richards, 1999). Perhaps the most prominent manifestation of the I-paradigm \nthough can be found in cognitive studies looking at processes of \u201ccreative cognition\u201d (see for \nexample Ward et al., 1999). What all these diverse approaches have in common is their attempt to \nrelate creativity to something from within the psychology of the person. \n \nAlong with advances in theoretical models, the I-paradigm was also fruitful for research \nmethodology (see Mayor, 1999). Psychometric approaches flourished, most creativity tests being \ndeveloped to measure divergent thinking and problem-solving abilities (Sternberg, 2003; Barron and \nHarrington, 1981). In the spirit of the I-paradigm, these tests were validated on and applied to non-\neminent persons (Runco, 2004) but remained open to criticism since they looked at the end-product \nand not the creative process behind it (Barron & Harrington, 1981). Overall, taking into account \nboth theory and research methods, it could be said that the I-paradigm largely encouraged \nmethodological reductionism (Montuori & Purser, 1997) by focusing on intrapsychic processes to \nthe exclusion of other levels. This generated partial theoretical models that explore individual \ncognition and personality in a social vacuum and conceptualize creativity as a quality of the lone \nindividual. The critique of this decontextualized view led to the emergence of the We-paradigm.       \n   \n1.3. The We-paradigm: towards a social psychology of creativity  \n \nDriven by an attributional error commonly described in psychology, both laypeople and researchers \ngenerally attribute creativity to creators\u2019 internal dispositions ignoring nondispositional influences \n(Kasof, 1999, p. 156). Several notable attempts have been made to correct this error in recent \ndecades by initiating the first research programs to investigate the role of social factors in the \ncreative process (Amabile, 1996). Along with these a new vocabulary emerged, one bringing to the \nfront terms such as social creativity, the creativity that is the result of human interaction and \ncollaboration (Purser & Montuori, 2000), and showing a renewed interest in group creativity \n(Paulus et al., 1999; Nemeth at al., 2003; Paulus & Nijstad, 2003). In short, the We-paradigm \n \n5\nambitiously aims to \u201cput the social back\u201d (Hennessey, 2003a, p. 184) into the theory of creativity \nand starts from the assumption that \u201ccreativity takes place within, is constituted and influenced by, \nand has consequences for, a social context\u201d (Westwood & Low, 2003, p. 236). Rejecting atomistic \nand positivistic standpoints and adopting more holistic and systemic ways of looking at creativity, \nthe psychologists promoting the We-paradigm acknowledge the social nature of creativity (Purser & \nMontuori, 2000), a process that spurs out of transactions between self and others, self and \nenvironment (Stein, 1975).  \n \nHowever, although formally the social psychology of creativity has been proposed as such by \nTeresa Amabile since the beginning of the \u201880s, much of the work done within it still endorses a \nvision of the social that corresponds more to individualistic paradigms than to a truly social \nperspective. In making this claim I rely on Markov\u00e1\u2019s (2003) discussion of external Ego-Alter \nrelationships envisioning self and other, the individual and the social, as two distinct units. This kind \nof conceptualization, common to modern social psychology (Farr, 1996), ends up portraying the \nsocial as an external environment, a set of stimulations that facilitate or constrain the creative act \n(the \u201cpress\u201d factor; Rhodes, 1961, cited in Runco, 2004), and therefore remains oblivious to the \nsocial roots, social dynamics and social functions of creativity.   \n \nFor example, Amabile\u2019s social psychology of creativity grants social factors a \u201ccrucial role in \ncreative performance\u201d (1996, p. 6). In her extensive work she, along with collaborators, used a \nvariety of methods to investigate the role of intrinsic motivation in creativity. Their conclusion, \nimportant for the psychology of creativity in general, is formalized as the Intrinsic Motivation \nPrinciple of Creativity, and states that intrinsic motivation, or doing something for its own sake, is \ngenerally associated with increased creativity, while extrinsic motivation, or the motivation to do \nsomething for an external goal, often leads to a decrease in creative performance (Amabile, 1996; \nHennessey, 2003a). The role of motivation is reflected in Amabile\u2019s componential model of \ncreativity comprising domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant skills, and task motivation. \nConsidering the above, a legitimate question arises: where is the social in this model? \nDisappointingly, the answer offered is that, \u201clargely because they affect motivation, social factors \ncan have a powerful impact on creativity\u201d (Amabile, 1996, p. 3). This is in tone with the declared \naim of Amabile\u2019s social psychology of creativity, \u201cto identify particular social and environmental \nconditions that can positively or negatively influence the creativity of most individuals\u201d (p. 5). \nConsequently, the discussion of the social in her book is constantly framed in terms of choice and \nconstraints, reward, competition, modeling, stimulation, evaluation, peer pressure, surveillance, etc. \nand therefore does not abandon the understanding of creativity as an individual-level phenomenon \n\u201cconditioned\u201d by social factors.  \n \nOther accounts informing the social psychology of creativity depart from the study of the individual \nand focus on larger societal contexts. Using impressive collections of data about creative persons \nthroughout history and quantifying aspects of the social world and the personal life of the creators, \nD.K. Simonton (1975, 1976, 1999) reached several interesting conclusions about the way in which \nsocial, cultural, political and economic factors impact on creativity. His ample and fertile research, \n \n6\n\u201cthe largest systematic program of research in the social psychology of creativity\u201d (Amabile, 1996, \np. 213), used historiometry as a nomothetic approach to creativity. Although appealing for the rigor \nof its procedures, this specific methodology greatly influences the choice and selection of subjects, \nas well as on the nature of the conclusions. Suitable for a historiometric analysis, Simonton (1988) \nfocused on scientific geniuses and, more generally, on \u201cgreat\u201d creative achievements to the \nexclusion of more common forms of creativity (something specific to the He-paradigm). \nFurthermore, the nomothetic orientation aims to unravel general patterns and correlations between \nfactors at the cost of understanding the individual circumstances of the creators.  \n \nFrom the two accounts above it becomes clear that what a social psychology of creativity would \nneed is to be able to bring together both individuals and societal structures. Systemic models of \ncreativity represent, from this perspective, perhaps the greatest achievements of the We-paradigm. A \nwell-known example is offered by Csikszentmihalyi (1988; 1999), who proposed the connection in \nthe creative production between a person (with his\/her genetic pool and personal experiences), a \nfield (social system) and a domain (system of symbols, related to the idea of culture). Although it \nmainly pays attention to historical creativity rather than more common instances of the \nphenomenon, this model is nonetheless essential for a We-paradigm since, as an ecological and \nsystemic approach, it \u201crecognizes the interconnectedness between the self and the environment and \nattempts to discover relations between them\u201d (Montuori & Purser, 1995, pp. 81-82). Furthermore, \nCsikszentmihalyi (1988) repeatedly stressed the contextual and generative nature of creativity. This \nmeans that creativity is explicitly considered as embedded within a social and historical milieu and \nthat every act of creation must start from and build upon the existing knowledge within a \u201cdomain\u201d. \nIt is because of these qualities that systems approaches in general have a great appeal for \npsychologists involved in the study of creativity and we can now find a series of successful \napplications of these perspectives (e.g., the case of families of gifted children, Moon et al., 1998). \n \nThe systemic and ecological frameworks of the We-paradigm bring a series of advantages. First and \nforemost, they contextualize creative acts and give a more comprehensive account of how creativity \ntakes place in all its complexity. Second, they are much better equipped to investigate both historical \ncreativity (initially the He-paradigm) and everyday creativity (looked at by the I-paradigm). Third, \non a practical note, they open a new world of opportunities for influencing creative behavior now \nconceptualized as less dependent on innate abilities and personality traits (Amabile, 1996). Despite \nthese benefits, reactions against the We approach didn\u2019t take long to materialize. Analyzing the \nsocial ethos in much of today\u2019s literature on creativity, Runco (1999) fears it is misleading and that, \nin comparing social with individual factors, \u201cit is the social factors that are not necessary for \ncreativity\u201d (p. 237). The author even proposes to separate creativity from reputation and therefore to \ncut the process from its context since this would eliminate the \u201csocial noise\u201d affecting the inner (and \n\u201creal\u201d) dynamic of creativity. Needless to say, this article is intended to show that the social does \nnot \u201cperturb\u201d creativity but allows it since, without the social context, there would be no creativity. \nIn the words of Csikszentmihalyi (1988, p. 336), we must go beyond the Ptolemaic view putting the \nperson in the centre of creativity in favor of a Copernican model. This is also the aim of the newest \ndevelopment within the We-paradigm: the cultural psychology of creativity.  \n \n7\n2. The emergence of a cultural psychology of creativity   \n \nAs argued above, the \u201csocial\u201d of the We-paradigm often fails to go beyond an external-influence \nmodel and to see how creativity takes place within relations. In other words, the We-paradigm has to \nrightfully acknowledge the interdependence between Ego and Alter (Markov\u00e1, 2003, p. xiii) in the \ncreative act. This is the starting point for one of the newest perspectives in the field: the cultural \npsychology approach to creativity (see also Gl\u0103veanu, 2008; in press). It must be said that this \ndiscipline doesn\u2019t aim to replace the social psychology of creativity but to build on its conclusions \nand to reveal \u201canother side\u201d of the We-paradigm: the social and cultural working from within the \ncreative person and process. This is the contemporary retake of an old theme in creativity theory, \nwhat Arieti (1976) called the \u201cindividual-psychological versus the sociocultural origin of creativity\u201d \n(p. 303). The cultural psychological position in this debate is that there is no versus between the two \nand, even more, that these two \u201csegments\u201d are not isolated but elements that co-constitute each \nother.  \n \nBefore introducing in more detail a cultural psychology framework of creativity, I will briefly \ndiscuss the characteristics of cultural psychology and focus on reviewing some theories or concepts \nwithin this discipline that address or could address the problem of creativity. \n \n2.1. Creativity and cultural psychology           \n \nNot only are cultural psychology perspectives on creativity relatively recent, but cultural (or \nsociocultural) psychology itself has only (re)taken shape in the last few decades and is now not a \nunified but an emergent field. Reacting to the search for inbuilt and universal processing \nmechanisms that took over general and cross-cultural psychology after the cognitive revolution, \ncultural psychology is, in the words of Shweder (1990), a study of how \u201ccultural traditions and \nsocial practices regulate, express, transform, and permute the human psyche\u201d (p. 1). To understand \nthese processes, cultural psychologists start from the basic premise of the interdependence between \nhuman beings and their socio-cultural context. Therefore, the focus is not on the two as separate \nentities, but on the transactions that define both of them and generate a symbolic world (Zittoun, \n2007b). This symbolic world spurs out of processes of meaning-making and co-construction of \nknowledge (Valsiner & Rosa, 2007) and this is why cultural psychology envisions human existence \nas essentially mediated through the system of symbols and norms that constitute culture. \nConsequently, the research focus in cultural psychology is on mediated action in context, on the \nsociocultural genesis of mental functions, and the analysis of everyday life (Cole, 1996, p. 104).  \n \nAs a paradigm that examines systemic, interactive, and mediated phenomena (Zittoun et al., 2007, \np. 208), cultural psychology developed a specific understanding of culture described as a web of \nsignificance, an interworked system of construable signs, not external power but context (Geertz, \n1973). Furthermore, these meanings and symbols \u201cstick\u201d through time (Jovchelovitch, 2007), they \nare preserved and transmitted to new generations offering our symbolic universe a certain degree of \n \n8\nstability. Simultaneously they are open to change, elaboration and transformation through collective \nprocesses of action and communication. Perspectives on culture that emphasize the construction and \nuse of mediators are most easily integrated by cultural psychology, for example Michael Cole\u2019s \n(1996) understanding of culture as a system of accumulated artifacts of a group (p. 110). The \nartifact, at once material and conceptual in nature (with illustrations ranging from language to \npottery), mediates the relation between subject and object and is a result of communication between \nself and other (persons, groups or societies).  \n \nIn this context, creativity both relies on the accumulated artifacts and enriches culture through the \ngeneration of new artifacts. As such, creative processes should constitute a key point of interest for \nthe discipline of cultural psychology. While there is so far no \u201cformally\u201d constructed cultural \npsychology of creativity, several sociocultural directions have recently inspired empirical research \non collaborative creativity, resulting in books (see Littleton & Miell, 2004) and journal special \nissues (see Thinking Skills and Creativity journal, 3\/2008). At a theoretical level, different traditions \nwithin cultural psychology can be built upon in constructing a cultural psychology of creativity and, \nfrom them, the cultural-historical Russian school, and especially the writings of Lev Vygotsky, are \nparticularly relevant. As one of the father figures of cultural psychology, Vygotsky (1960\/1997) \npointed to the importance of cultural mediation through tools and signs for the development of all \nhigher mental functions. Vygotsky\u2019s early work on imagination and creativity in childhood \n(1930\/1998) laid the foundations for a cultural approach to creativity by asserting that: 1) creativity \nexists in the everyday and not only in great historical works, and 2) every creator is a product of \nhis\/her time and environment. What transpires from the cultural-historical perspective is that \ncreators use culturally constructed symbols and tools to produce new cultural artifacts (see also \nMoran & John-Steiner, 2003). Furthermore, Vygotsky was primarily interested in the ontogenesis \nand microgenesis of creativity and in creativity as a process occurring in real-life \u201ccollaborations\u201d \n(like those between child and adult). It is because of these preoccupations that the Vygotskian \nperspective remains central to any cultural perspective on creativity and this includes the proposed \nframework to be discussed further in the article. This framework also combines ideas from several \nlines of thought, three of which are briefly presented below: Winnicott and the notion of potential \nspace, dialogicality and creativity as dialogue, and the everyday use of symbolic resources.    \n      \nSimilar to Vygotsky, who proposed \u201cthat creative imagination develops from children\u2019s symbolic \nplay interactions with caregivers\u201d (Smolucha, 1992, p. 51), Donald Winnicott (1971) developed an \nimportant thesis claiming that creativity and cultural experience are twinborn in the potential or \ntransitional space through creative playing in early childhood. The notion of potential space, central \nto the conception of the author, is that of a relational space \u201cbetween the individual and the \nenvironment\u201d (p. 100), a space of experiencing the world situated between inner self and external \nlife, a notion that came to be equated with the area of intersubjectivity. Creativity therefore has a \nstrong social basis as it emerges primarily in a relationship, that between the mother and the child. \nBesides establishing creativity as relational, Winnicott\u2019s account can be considered an excellent \ntheoretization of everyday creativity in its most basic expression. For him, creativity is not \n \n9\nembodied in products but it is primarily a process, what he described as \u201ccreative living\u201d, a healthy \nway of living that leaves room for personal expression and spontaneity.  \n \nIf Winnicott\u2019s account can give us an idea of where creativity is located, and that is in the space of \ninterrelations, we further need to understand how exactly creativity emerges in relations and it is \nhere where notions of dialogue and dialogicality become instrumental.  \n \n\u201cDialogue is the meeting ground on which new questions are raised, the mating ground on \nwhich new combinations are found, and the testing ground in which novelties are critically \nevaluated and assimilated into the body of shared knowledge and thought\u201d (Gruber, 1998, p. \n139). \n \nContinuing his argument, Gruber asserts that all creativity requires, at least at certain points in the \nprocess, some form of communication or social exchange. This is not only applicable to explicit \nmoments of social interaction since for the cultural psychologist the human mind is dialogical, \nmeaning that it can \u201cconceive, create and communicate about social realities in terms of the \u2018Alter\u2019\u201d \n(Markov\u00e1, 2003, p. xiii). The relevance of this perspective is supported by Barrett (1999) who \nrecognized knowledge creation, therefore both thinking and creativity, as inherently social-\ndialogical processes. This means that, even when we are alone and apparently creating in complete \nsolitude, we are still engaged in dialogue with internalized \u201cparties\u201d such as our mentors, our \naudience, our critics, etc.  In the words of Negus and Pickering (2004, p. 23), creativity entails a \ncommunicative experience, intersubjectivity and interactive dialogue. This dialogue is made \npossible by the use of cultural elements and it is these elements that constitute the substance of our \ncreative acts. The question remains of when we are more likely to use cultural elements in a creative \nmanner. \n \nThis leads us, finally, to the notion of symbolic resources as developed by T. Zittoun (2007a; \n2007b). The main thesis of this conception is that whenever people find themselves facing a \ndiscontinuity, a break or rupture of their taken-for-granted ordinary experience (of their inner self, of \nthe relations with others or the environment), they engage in processes specific to \u201ctransitions\u201d and \nresort to symbolic resources to elaborate meaning and externalize the outcome (Zittoun et al., 2003; \nZittoun, 2007b). Needless to say this outcome (not necessarily material) is most often creative, \nespecially since it comes out of a situation where there is no learned or practiced solution (Torrance, \n1988). To qualify as a symbolic resource, the element must be used by someone for something, \nusually re-contextualizing meaning into a newly resulting socio-cultural formation (Zittoun et al., \n2003, p. 418). Symbolic resources vary in nature, from concrete artifacts to conceptual and \nprocedural elements. All symbolic resources emerge from social interaction (Zittoun, 2007a) and \nrequire a symbolic labor, the necessary work in the terms of Willis (1990, p. 9) \u201cto ensure the daily \nproduction and reproduction of human existence\u201d. \n \nFrom the perspectives outlined above, some conclusions can be drawn about the cultural psychology \nconceptualization of creativity: 1) it considers creative acts as socio-cultural in nature and origin; \n \n10\n2) it stresses the role of intersubjectivity and dialogical interaction in the creative expression and 3) \nit looks at how cultural symbolic elements come to form the texture of new and creative products. \nAll these basic premises are therefore at the core of the creativity framework discussed in the next \nsection. \n \n2.2. A cultural psychology framework for creativity and its implications \n \n2.2.1. Definition and theoretical framework \n \nAs mentioned earlier, until now no \u201ccultural psychology of creativity\u201d has been formally \nconstructed as such. Reviewed before were nonetheless important theoretical leads that could \nsupport such a construction. A cultural definition of creativity would need to take into account the \nsocial embedment of creative acts as well as their relation to cultural resources. In the literature on \ncreativity some of these features tend to appear in a number of definitions:  \n \n\u201ca creative individual solves problems, fashions products, or poses new questions within a \ndomain in a way that is initially considered to be unusual but is eventually accepted within at \nleast one cultural group\u201d (Gardner, 1994, p. 145). \n \n\u201cI define creativity as activity that produces something new through the recombination and \ntransformation of existing cultural practices or forms\u201d (Liep, 2001, p. 2).  \n \n\u201cMuch human creativity is social, arising from activities that take place in a context in which \ninteraction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential \ncontributors\u201d (Fischer et al., 2005, p.  482). \n \nSupported by these formulations, I will define creativity from a cultural perspective as a complex \nsocio-cultural-psychological process that, through working with \u201cculturally-impregnated\u201d \nmaterials within an intersubjective space, leads to the generation of artifacts that are evaluated as \nnew and significant by one or more persons or communities at a given time. As seen from before, \nthe socio-cultural-psychological process is a dialogical one, the \u201cculturally-impregnated\u201d materials \nare symbolic resources (signs and tools from a Vygotskian perspective) used in creative acts, and the \nintersubjective space is a potential space, between creator and community. Adopting this definition \nopens up a new world of possibilities for studying creativity without individualizing it or looking \nexclusively at its cognitive aspects. In fact, the cultural psychology of creativity as proposed here \n\u201cputs\u201d creativity into a tetradic framework depicted in Figure 1: \n \n \n \n \n \n11\n  \n \nFIGURE 1. A proposed cultural framework of creativity \n \nIn this framework, the new artifact (material or conceptual) is seen as emerging within the relation \nbetween self (creator) and others (broadly understood as a community), all three being immersed \ninto and in dialogue with an existing body of cultural artifacts, symbols and established norms. This \nmodel is not structural but dynamic since it is in the \u201ctensions\u201d between all four elements that \ncreativity takes shape with the \u201cnew artifact\u201d becoming part of \u201cexisting culture\u201d (for self and\/or \ncommunity) and constantly alimenting the creative cycle. As Zittoun and collaborators (2003, p. \n441) suggest, \u201cwith the use of symbolic resources, there is always something produced, something \nexternalized, which is attached to the producer primarily by the gaze of the other\u201d. This implies the \nstrong links between the creative outcome and the identity of the creator(s), as well as the role of the \nother in constructing this identity. At the same time, creativity could not exist outside of our relation \nwith other people within a cultural setting since every new artifact needs constant meaning-making \nprocesses that make sense of it and this becomes possible only by using what Buner (1990) calls \ninterpretative procedures. What is of key importance in the cultural psychology approach is that \nthese interpretations are always context-dependent (Montuori & Purser, 1995) and therefore there is \nno \u201creal\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d creativity, but one that is constructed within communities, in relation to \nauthors and creative products.    \n \nAnother conclusion derived from this framework is that creativity is a generative process; it is \nconnected to previous knowledge and cultural repertoires and in a dialogical relationship with the \n\u201cold\u201d or the \u201calready-there\u201d. Any innovative idea or object never comes out ex nihilo, as in the \nromantic visions of the genius specific to the He-paradigm. This aspect has been recognized early on \nin the literature, the fact that \u201chuman creativity uses what is already existing and available and \nchanges it in unpredictable ways\u201d (Arieti, 1976, p. 4; see also Liep, 2001; Hennessey, 2003a; Negus \n \n12\n& Pickering, 2004). Moreover, a history of misconception of what tradition is needs to be \nchallenged. In the creativity framework above, tradition and previous knowledge are part and parcel \nof the creative process, since, as Feldman (1974, p. 68) notes, \u201call creative thought springs from a \nbase of cultural knowledge and is therefore, by definition, part of a cultural tradition -- even when it \nbreaks with tradition\u201d. Furthermore, tradition itself is not a pre-given, singular, rigid and abstract \ncultural entity (Negus & Pickering, 2004); creativity and tradition are interpenetrated and, in all \ncases, the emergence and meaning of innovation is bound up with tradition (Wilson, 1984).  \n \nAlongside these theoretical considerations, the cultural psychology framework presented above has \na potentially great impact on creativity research. The problems under the scrutiny of sociocultural \npsychologists correspond to the four composing elements of the tetradic framework and their \ninterrelations. For example, when looking at the creative \u201cself\u201d, the author(s) of the creative \noutcome, one central aspect to be investigated has to do with identity and especially \u201ccreative \nidentities\u201d, how they are constructed, re-constructed and manifested while performing the creative \ntask and outside of it. When focusing on \u201cothers\u201d, or the community\/communities creators are in \ndialogue with, it would be interesting to observe how members of different communities assess the \ncreativity of one and the same artifact. Changing to \u201cprevious knowledge\u201d, one immediate question \nis how it is used in the creative act, what artifacts from our cultural repertoires become activated, \nturning into symbolic resources that sustain the creative activity, and how they combine in order to \ngenerate a novel output. This leads to the \u201cnew artifact\u201d and the meaning-making processes taking \nplace around the \u201cnew\u201d, how it is understood by both creator, community and maybe society at \nlarge, how is it anchored and made familiar (to use a social representations theory terminology; \nMoscovici, 2000), and how it becomes part of the existing set of artifacts allowing further creative \ncycles to take place. Above all, what should come to the front are the dialogical connections \nbetween self and other, previous knowledge and new artifact, that are considered in any cultural \nresearch in their unity, as a dynamic and ecological whole.   \n \nPrincipally, what distinguishes cultural research on creativity is the emic perspective on the \nphenomenon (see Smith & Bond, 1998). This ultimately means that researchers are advised to go to \nthe field with the least amount of preconceptions about what creativity is or should be and to \nconnect to the local ways of sense-making specific to the setting they are investigating. An emic-\noriented researcher would be very careful in applying \u201cscientific\u201d Western notions of creativity to \nother places in the world (for a discussion see Westwood & Low, 2003, p. 237-238). Consequently \nsocial \u201cconstructions\u201d of what a certain creative outcome is, how creative it is and, above all, what \ncreativity is, are all to be carefully collected from participants in order to capture how both the \n\u201cimage\u201d and \u201cmanifestation\u201d of creativity are interrelated in any particular cultural setting. \n2.2.2. Relevance and implications of the cultural psychology framework \n \nThe cultural psychology of creativity and, more specifically, the tetradic framework discussed \nabove, represent a proposition for a novel approach to creativity rather than a definite theory. It is a \nwork in progress that, despite its general and abstract formulation at this stage, could greatly \nimprove our understanding of creativity. The present article tries to put forward a broad formulation \n \n13\nof a cultural psychology of creativity that draws from both sociocultural theories (notions of \nartifacts and symbolic resources, the theory of dialogicality, etc.) and social, systemic models of \ncreativity. What both perspectives have in common is a rejection of an individualistic and \nreductionist view of creativity as a purely individual phenomenon and an emphasis put on the role \nof self-other relations in creative acts.  \n \nIn this regard, using a cultural psychology approach improves existing social-psychological \naccounts by going beyond the perspective of the social as an environment that constrains or \nfacilitates creative acts. Creativity is not simply \u201cconditioned\u201d by social factors, its mere nature is \nrelational since it could not exist outside of cultural resources and dialogical relations. Furthermore, \nthe tetradic framework elaborates further current systemic models like that of Csikszentmihalyi by \nusing a broader conceptualization of the \u201cfield\u201d (social structures) and the \u201cdomain\u201d (cultural \nstructures). While systemic models are useful for the analysis of socially valuable creations (cases of \nhistorical creativity), the cultural model aims to be relevant for the study of different forms of \ncreativity, from \u201cminor\u201d creative expressions to revolutionary creations. In order to accomplish this, \nit conceives the field and domain in a more flexible and less \u201cinstitutional\u201d manner. The \u201cfield\u201d, \nseen as a group of experts allowing or not the creation to enter a certain domain, is only a particular \ninstance of the possible role \u201cothers\u201d play in the process of creativity. The notion of \n\u201cother\/community\u201d used in the tetradic framework therefore allows us to capture more facets of the \n\u201cother\u201d: from persons in the vicinity of the creator to the members of different social groups the \ncreator is part of, and, finally, to the institutions that validate a work as being creative or not. \nSimilarly, the \u201cdomain\u201d is more than a structured field of knowledge (like a scientific branch or an \nartistic discipline for example) that will, in the end, incorporate or reject the creation. The notion of \n\u201cexisting artifacts\/culture\u201d I made reference to in the cultural framework incorporates all forms of \nmaterial and symbolic resources that inform the creative process and these can be drawn from \nseveral \u201cdomains\u201d as well as common-sense knowledge. More fundamentally, what the cultural \npsychology perspective advocates for is the multiplicity of \u201cfields\u201d and \u201cdomains\u201d a person engages \nwithin any form of creative activity and the necessity of studying as many levels of the \u201csocial and \ncultural\u201d context of the phenomenon as possible in order to have a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of each particular situation. The theoretical position of cultural psychology sets two \nspecific and interrelated goals for any sociocultural approach to creativity: 1) to unpack the \nmicrogenesis of creativity in community settings and 2) to operate with a contextual definition of \ncreativity, dependent upon \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cfolk\u201d notions of creativity. \n \nThese two aims have a series of consequences for how we theorize and study creativity. The \ntheoretical implication involves a reconceptualization of the levels of creativity by locating all of \nthem at a community level. Deriving from this, the practical implication refers to creativity \nassessment and the need for a more ecological and contextualized way of appreciating creative \noutcomes. Both of these are discussed as follows.     \n \nFrom a cultural psychology perspective, thinking in terms of polarities such as P-creativity (creative \nfor the person) and H-creativity (creative for society) (Boden, 1994), creativity in the small and \n \n14\nmature creativity (Cohen & Ambrose, 1999) or, respectively, \u201clittle c\u201d and \u201cbig C\u201d (Paulus & \nNijstad, 2003), is generally misleading. From the beginning these suggest a hierarchy in creativity \nthat often trivializes the notion of everyday creativity (Bateson, 1999). Second, although it is largely \nacknowledged nowadays that there is a continuum in creative expression (for steps in this \ncontinuum see Cohen & Ambrose, 1999), the habit of dichotomizing creativity can only disconnect \nthe different modalities of being creative. Finally, this polarization also opens the risk of unwillingly \npromoting the \u201cdissolution\u201d of creativity either by considering every human act as creative or by \nsetting standards for creativity so high that the vast majority of people could never reach it (Negus \n& Pickering, 2004). What solution is there?  \n \nA possible answer, reflective of the cultural psychology approach, is to acknowledge the social and \ncultural roots of all types of creative expression, from personal to historical. From this perspective, \nalthough there are numerous differences between the works of art of an established modernist \npainter and the drawings of a toddler, in the end they both emerge within a social context and from \nthe use of cultural means. Creativity always takes place in a community and the creative outcome is \ngenerally of interest for multiple communities. This helps us \u201crelocate\u201d creativity from the extremes \n(person or society) to the \u201cmiddle\u201d and, by this, to give it a more sensible position (Gl\u0103veanu, in \npress; a similar argument has been recently supported by Etel\u00e4pelto & Lahti, 2008). As mentioned \nearlier, the notion of \u201cfield\u201d from systemic models of creativity takes on a new meaning when social \ngroups are theorized as communities. A community is not understood only in its topographical sense \nor as a local social system; it necessarily requires the existence of communion, of close ties and the \nfeeling of belongingness between its members (see Urry, 2007) and can describe different social \nrealities, from small groups to organizations and larger social structures. Communities exist where \nthey are felt and experienced as such (Jovchelovitch, 2007). Most importantly, communities support \ntheir own culture (Duveen, 2007) and it is in communities that people find not only the resources \nthey need to create but also the \u201cparameters\u201d for making sense of the world (Jovchelovitch, 2007) \nand all its creative, new artifacts.   \n \nThis last suggestion has direct implications for assessing creativity. As repeatedly argued, \u201cthe \ncreativity of an idea depends not just on the content of the idea but the way in which that idea is \ndeveloped, presented and interpreted\u201d (Bilton, 2007, p. 6). This fact is stressed by most definitions \nof creativity (see Stein, 1962; Gardner, 1994; Fischer et al., 2005). The argument that \u201ccreativity is \nsocially defined\u201d (Nijstad & Paulus, 2003, p. 339), gives even more impetus to social and cultural \npsychologists in showing that there would be no creativity without others to appreciate it as such. In \nfact, what this approach argues is that creativity is not inherent to artifacts or persons but it is \nsocially attributed to them. Furthermore, all judgments about creativity are historically located and \nthere is no \u201cview from nowhere\u201d, an absolute statement about what is or is not creative. \nUnderstanding how and why different social groups attribute creativity differently (or similarly) is \none of the main tasks of a cultural psychology of creativity. And this is because being creative \nalways means being creative for someone (person, group, society) at a particular time and place. \nUnder these circumstances, the traditional practice of assessing creativity with the use of experts, \ntrained persons able to offer \u201cinformed\u201d opinions, offers only a partial picture. This practice \n \n15\ncontributes further to associating creativity only with certain types of \u201cspecialist\u201d fields, like art, \ntechnology or science. It presupposes working with pre-set and universal definitions of creativity \ntherefore adopting an etic stand, as opposed to an emic one, open to the local (personal and\/or \ncommunity) understandings of what is and is not creative.  \n \nBut, as Amabile (1996) comes to demonstrate through her Consensual Assessment Technique (also \nHennessey, 2003b), there is generally no need for already made definitions. The basic assumption of \nthis method is that appropriate observers (again usually with some formal training in the field) \nimplicitly work with similar notions about what is creative, despite the fact that they are not \nformalized or given. Without getting into its details, this technique is based on the idea of \nconsensus, of converging beliefs and perceptions about creativity.  \n \nFrom a cultural psychology perspective, creativity assessment should be as \u201cecological\u201d as possible \nand rely on multiple feedback at the cost of getting diverging opinions (and, to an extent, pursuing \nexactly that). More precisely, creative products and processes should be assessed by members of \nsignificant or relevant communities, which are those \u201caffected\u201d by or in contact with the creative \nwork, as well as the creator himself. To take an example, a teenager\u2019s artwork should not be subject \nonly to expert judgments (persons trained in art), but also to the judgment of peers, parents, teachers \nand members from other groups and communities that get to see the creative productions or are \ngenerally interested in art (from other artists to potential buyers). Since the creative outcome \nrequires meaning-making processes and these, in their turn, depend on the particular socio-cultural \ncircumstances of the persons attributing meaning, the \u201cmultiple feedback\u201d is often less consensual \nbut far more useful, including for the teenager in our example. The importance of this perspective \nresides in its simultaneous focus, in real-life contexts, on a) the reasons behind attributions of \ncreativity by several social actors, b) the functions these attributions serve and c) the consequences \nthey have on both creator and creative process. This technique certainly does not aim to promote the \nidea that higher consensus between different groups would validate something as being \u201cin reality\u201d \ncreative because the search for this kind of \u201cultimate\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d statements goes against the \nconstructionist nature of the investigation. It also does not reject scientific or expert appreciations \nabout the creativity of certain outcomes but considers them as one form of assessment among \nothers, coming from non-expert but nevertheless relevant groups of persons connected in one way or \nanother to the \u201ccreation\u201d. Since the meaning-making processes around creativity and their link to \nparticular social milieus are paramount, there is no hierarchy of viewpoints to be established.         \n \n3. Concluding remarks about the future of the We-paradigm  \n \nAs argued in this article, there are three major paradigms that have shaped and continue to influence \nthe trajectory of creativity in psychology. Historically, individualistic approaches constitute the \nnorm, locating creativity either inside \u201cunique\u201d individuals (the He-paradigm) or inside each and \nevery person taken separately (the I-paradigm). It is only in the last decades that more emphasis has \nbeen put on the role of social factors in the creative process. These are the first signs of a new \nparadigm, the We-paradigm, aiming to develop more systemic approaches of creativity, \n \n16\ncomprehensive views that incorporate multiple levels, from individuals and interpersonal \ninteractions, to groups and cultures (Simonton, 2003, p. 320). And yet, the whole project of the We-\nparadigm may be derailed by letting the theoretization go only half-way. This \u201cincomplete\u201d vision \nsees the social and cultural as coercive instances, as an environment that has the power to facilitate \nor inhibit creative expression. In the end, the person still sits \u201calone\u201d, self-contained and self-\nsufficient, ready to confront the \u201csystem\u201d and, if \u201ccreative enough\u201d, to defeat it.  \n \nIn this context, the cultural psychology of creativity advocated here tries to take a step forward in \nconsolidating the We-paradigm. For those looking for universalistic claims and \u201cfit-all\u201d models of \ncreativity, this approach will be disappointing. It has no \u201cformulas\u201d (Littleton & Miell, 2004, p. 2) \nand promotes the contextual and situated study of creative acts, persons and communities. What the \ncultural psychology of creativity will have to offer are, first and foremost, research examples of \n\u201cgood-practice\u201d and theoretical approaches that try to see creativity in all its complexity. This new \ndirection also brings with it practical consequences outside of the scientific realm. One has already \nbeen formulated by Montuori and Purser (1995, p. 104): a shift in our cultural project of dominating \nthe environment to nurturing and engendering creative relationships within it. It is a reminder of our \nresponsibility as community members to build spaces for dialogue and creativity for both self and \nothers, of the fact that, living interconnected with other people, our creative expression could and \nshould be able to fertilize the common soil of creativity around us. \n \nIt is hard to make predictions about the direction in which creativity theory will move. While the \nfuture of the We-paradigm is hard to anticipate, and it probably too early to be anticipated, the \nfuture of creativity in psychology is sure to be looking bright. For as long as psychologists find \ncreativity instrumental for our adaptability, self-expression, and health (Runco, 2004), it will \ncontinue to attract the interest of both theorists and researchers. But we should remember that \ncreativity also exists beyond psychology. As Magyari-Beck (1999) argues when describing the new \nscience of Creatology, the nature of creativity research is increasingly cross-disciplinary bringing \ntogether psychologists, sociologists, artists, educators, historians, managers, economists, etc. under a \ncommon enterprise. Perhaps at this broader level the We-paradigm will become more rapidly \ninfluential and sociocultural psychologists could play a key role in this future development.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAmabile, T.M.
