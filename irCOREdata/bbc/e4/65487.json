I do not believe he has achieved this yet, but I\napplaud his identification of the issues and his ini-\ntial efforts to resolve them. I greatly look forward to\nhis next attempt, for he has set out a series of admi-\nrable and difficult goals and, realistically speaking,\nit would be unfair to expect full resolution at first try.\nIn the meantime this book is a very important contri-\nbution to Australian prehistory, and it deserves wide\nreading on this account as well as owing to the theo-\nretical problems it raises, even if these are not yet solved.\nDavid S.

Printworld (P) Ltd; ISBN 81-246-\n0217-4 hardback, \u00a330.00, ix + 281 pp.\nRobin Coningham & Catherine Hardman\nA section focusing on the relationship between ar-\nchaeology and identity in South Asia was published\nin Antiquity in 2000. As editors, Nick Lewer (conflict\nresolution) and Coningham (South Asian archaeol-\nogy) wished to investigate the role played by ar-\nchaeology and politics in the creation of identities.\nExpectations of a close relationship between archae-\nology and politics were realized as one potential\ncontributor withdrew as he left his country follow-\ning a coup and another after being appointed a High\nCommissioner. That collection of papers forms part\nof a growing corpus of studies of the development of\narchaeology within South Asia (Ratnagar in press),\nto which Dilip Chakrabarti\u2019s book is one of the most\nrecent contributions. Those expecting this book to be\na continuation of his History of Indian Archaeology:\nfrom the Beginning to 1947 will be surprised. Not only\nis the new volume entirely dedicated to India but,\nwhilst the former was organized around the work of\nAlexander Cunningham, John Marshall and Mortimer\nWheeler, his new volume covers 1947 to 2000 through\na series of reviews of publications. Furthermore, the\nbulk of the volume focuses on four issues of archaeo-\nlogical significance: education, religious fundamen-\ntalism, Third World archaeology and nationalism. Here\nwe will first review Chakrabarti\u2019s book before dis-\ncussing one of the broader issues that it raises: that\nof identity and the destruction of cultural heritage.\nThe first half of the volume narrates the devel-\nopment of Indian archaeology from 1947 to 2000 in\ntwo chapters, 1947 to 1973, and 1974 to 2000. The\nfirst section of Chapter 1 details the period between\n1947 and 1952 through a study of the journal of the\nArchaeological Survey of India (ASI), Ancient India.\nEditorials written by ASI Directors-General are\nblended with individual papers and books in order\nto chart the foundations of post-colonial archaeol-\nogy. This is followed by an examination of the pe-\nriod from 1954 to 1965, a timespan which the author\nCAJ 14:1, 156\u20139      \u00a9 2004 McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0959774304280106     Printed in the United Kingdom\n157\nReview Articles\nadmits is \u2018arbitary\u2019 (p. 14) but coincides with the\npublication of the journal, Indian Archaeology \u2013 a Re-\nview, which contains annual reports of fieldwork\nthroughout India. Reviews of individual papers and\nbooks are linked by commentaries but certain sec-\ntions appear descriptive, for example, the recording\nof the two-year delay to Ancient India (p. 21). In\ncontrast, Chakrabarti then analyzes every excava-\ntion in India between 1953 and 1965 and concludes\nthat only 39 of 144 sites were published (p. 31).\nThe third section covers 1966 to 1973 and in-\ncludes the publication of Puratattva (the Bulletin of\nthe Indian Archaeological Society) as well as text-\nbooks by the Allchins (1968) and Malik (1968). For\nthis, the final section of Chapter 1, Chakrabarti\nrecords a poorer record of excavation publication\nwith only 19 out of 112 published (p. 51) but he\nconcludes that this period was one of the expansion\nof archaeology, both in terms of the number of exca-\nvations as well as in the participation of Indian uni-\nversities.\nThe next phase, covered in Chapter 2, opens\nwith the publication of Sankalia\u2019s synthesis Prehis-\ntory and Protohistory of India and Pakistan (1974) and\nconsiders two of the most commonly used textbooks\nAgrawal\u2019s Archaeology of India (1982) and Allchin &\nAllchin\u2019s Rise of Civilisation in India and Pakistan (1982)\nbefore reviewing recent contributions, including his\nown book (Chakrabarti 1999). Strangely, Deccan Col-\nlege\u2019s magnificent volumes on Chalcolithic Inamgaon\n(Dhavalikar et al. 1988) are not heralded as the best\nIndian excavation publication and there is no men-\ntion of Mark Kenoyer et al.\u2019s pioneering ethnoarchaeo-\nlogical studies (1991). Assessing the publication rates\nfor this period, Chakrabarti concludes that although\nIndia invests a substantial sum in archaeological in-\nfrastructure, little attention is paid to outcomes (p.\n153) and blame is laid at the feet of the \u2018authorities\u2019.\nThe second half of the book tackles issues con-\nfronting Indian archaeology today. The first issue\nconcerns the relationship between heritage manage-\nment, education and nationalism. Identifying a\nmisapplication of Ford Foundation grants (p. 162),\nChakrabarti opens a fascinating study of the Indian\nlegal framework and its articulation with the ASI\nand considers the impact of dams (p. 178) and the\nillicit trade in antiquities (p. 180). An equally stimu-\nlating section summarizes the relationship between\narchaeology and education in India, with Chakrabarti\nconcluding that India is still dominated by colonial\nIndology (p. 194). Chapter 4 discusses religious fun-\ndamentalism with reference to the 1992 Ayodhya\nincident but also expands the book\u2019s Indian remit to\ndiscuss the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas.\nUnlike many commentators who have concentrated\non the sequence at Ayodhya (Ratnagar in press),\nChakrabarti concentrates on the professional gulf,\nwhich divides Indian academics into \u2018progressives\u2019 or\n\u2018reactionaries\u2019 (p. 203) and comments on their links\nwith political parties (p. 204). Chapter 5 offers a\ndefinition of Third World archaeology and argues\nthat archaeology in the third world should remain\npart of historical studies to remain relevant. Chakra-\nbarti also suggests that there is a tension between\nforeign and local scholars \u2018There is a distinct First\nWorld tradition of academic intolerance and\/or con-\ntempt for any contrary opinion emerging from the\nThird World\u2019 (pp. 221\u20132), although acknowledging\nthat this is lessened by \u2018one world archaeology\u2019. The\nvolume has no conclusion but ends with an appen-\ndix, which incorporates sections of his earlier Antiq-\nuity contribution (Chakrabarti 2000).\nThe volume, devoid of illustrations, is a fasci-\nnating personal analysis of post-colonial archaeol-\nogy in India, all the more so as it is written by an\nindividual who straddles both worlds. Not only does\nit provide original data, such as excavation publica-\ntion rates, but it does not hesitate to name issues\nfacing Indian archaeologists and attribute responsi-\nbility for failings.\nLet us develop Chakrabarti\u2019s suggestion that\nincidents like those at Ayodhya and Bamiyan \u2018are\nlikely to get worse\u2019 (p. 208) by examining three South\nAsian examples in order to explore whether there\nwas a commonality, related to identity, between\nthem. The three are the 1992 destruction of the Babri\nmosque at Ayodhya by militant Hindus, the 1998\ndestruction of the Temple of the Buddha\u2019s Tooth in\nSri Lanka by Tamil separatists and the 2001 destruc-\ntion of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban.\nWhilst each is complex, it is possible to identify\nfactors involved in their targeting. The Babri mosque,\nfor example, was destroyed because of the strength\nof popular belief that it was constructed on a Hindu\ntemple marking the birthplace of Rama, a temple\ndestroyed by the Mughal ruler, Babur (Rao 1999, 46).\nUnsupported archaeologically, this concept capti-\nvated the minds of militant Hindu groups who\nwished to release Rama from his \u2018imprisonment\u2019 (Rao\n1999, 47) by destroying the mosque and building a new\ntemple. In effect, the \u2018destruction of the mosque be-\ncame a direct response to a perceived wrong of 500\nyears ago\u2019 (Bernbeck & Pollock 1996, 140), although the\nongoing dispute concerning Kashmir, as well as the\nIndo-Pak wars had further polarized these identities.\nThe Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lanka was se-\n158\nReview Articles\nlected as a target owing to the importance of the\nBuddha\u2019s Relic to the majority Sinhalese population\n(Coningham & Lewer 1999, 863). Although Sri Lanka\nis a Democratic Socialist Republic, the close link be-\ntween the Buddhist order, political patronage and\nthe majority Sinhalese population led some to state\nafter the bombing (The Tamil Monitor 30\/3\/1998):\n\u2018While the bombing of the Temple of the Tooth ought\nto be condemned . . . the targeting of the temple, a\nsymbol of Buddhist chauvinism is the unfortunate\nconsequence of militant Buddhism\u2019. The fact that the\nmajority of restored cultural sites in the island are\nBuddhist has added to this perception that the past\nsupports the identity of a single section of the is-\nland\u2019s population \u2014 the Sinhalese (Coningham &\nLewer 1999, 865). Indeed, it is ironic that Tambiah\nstated in 1986 that the government of Sri Lanka must\nfeel \u2018free to sponsor the restoration of Buddhist monu-\nments . . . It would also behove a Sri Lankan govern-\nment to recognize at the same time that there are\nmonuments . . . that are neither Sinhalese or Bud-\ndhist\u2019 (1986, 126).\nIn the case of Bamiyan, the situation is more\ncomplex as Afghanistan is predominately Muslim\nand has no population of Buddhists. The Hazara\nminority, however, are Shi\u2019a as opposed to the Sunni\nTaliban and some commentators have stressed this\ndifference. Indeed, Rashid stated that the Buddhas\nhad become identified with this minority (The Daily\nTelegraph 3\/3\/2001): \u2018The statues have become a sym-\nbol of Hazara pride and resistance to the Taliban. By\ndestroying them, the Taliban aims to destroy the\nHazara cultural identity\u2019. Undoubtedly, the destruc-\ntion of the Buddhas was also linked to the enhance-\nment of the Taliban\u2019s identity as an ultra-orthodox\ngroup destroying images.\nWhilst it is clearly ironic that one of the expla-\nnations for the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,\nbuilt by an extinct Buddhist community, by the or-\nthodox Muslim Taliban was to rob the Shi\u2019a Hazara\ncommunity of their identity, similar patterns are en-\ncapsulated within the other two examples. The Tem-\nple of the Tooth was constructed by Sri Vikrama\nRajasimha II, a south Indian Tamil-speaking Hindu,\nwho was requested to take the Sri Lankan throne by\nSinhalese nobles because the last king died heirless\n(Coningham & Lewer 2000a,b, 709). As a result, Tamil\nseparatists damaged the creation of a Tamil ruler as\nwell as adjacent shrines to Vishnu and Pattini \u2014\nHindu deities incorporated into Buddhism. Finally,\n\u2018Muslims living in India are in many cases not even\nthe descendants of the Mughal invaders of the Mid-\ndle Ages but rather member of low Hindu castes\nwho have concerted to Islam\u2019 (Bernback & Pollock\n1996, 140) and many of those targeted by the mili-\ntants in the aftermath of the Babri destruction were\nprobably the descendants of such converts.\nOn reflection, we have to stress the very differ-\nent variables involved in these three disasters. All\nare geographically diverse and have involved the\ntargeting of monuments of very different religious\ntraditions. The perpetrators and victims of each are\nalso different; the crowd at Ayodhya, including mili-\ntants from the majority Hindu population, was sup-\nported, or rather not halted by the government; the\nTemple of the Tooth \u2014 associated with the majority\nidentity \u2014 was bombed by separatists from the Tamil\nminority; and the Bamiyan Buddhas, representing\nno contemporary community in Afghanistan, were\ndestroyed by the Taliban government. The three\nmonuments are also very different in terms of age as\nthe Babri mosque was dated to the fifteenth century\nAD, the Temple of the Tooth between the seventeenth\nand eighteenth centuries AD and the Buddhas to the\nfirst millennium AD. Each was afforded different pro-\ntection as the Babri mosque and Bamiyan Buddhas\nwere protected by national laws, and the Temple of\nthe Tooth internationally by UNESCO. Finally al-\nthough it may be fashionable to attribute such con-\nflicts to the legacy of colonial Indologies, this cannot\nbe the case for Afghanistan, which was historically\nindependent.\nIn conclusion, it should be stated that the one\nelement of commonality between these incidents is\nthat the historical rationale behind the suppression\nor emulation of identities was based on incorrect\nreadings of the past. Despite this absence of pattern,\nit is very worrying that they all occurred within a\nspan of ten years. Indeed, it is to be expected that as\nlong as identities, whether regional, religious or na-\ntional, derive part of their strength from the past,\ncultural monuments will be targeted for enhance-\nment or suppression. It is also to be expected that\nwith increasing availability of weaponry, such epi-\nsodes will become more frequent; in this light,\nChakrabarti\u2019s bleak prediction may well be proven.\nRobin Coningham\nDepartment of Archaeological Sciences\nUniversity of Bradford\nWest Yorkshire\nBD7 1DP\nUK\nEmail: R.A.E.Coningham@bradford.ac.uk\n159\nReview Articles\nCatherine Hardman\nAHDS Archaeology\nKing\u2019s Manor\nYork\nYO1 7EP\nUK\nEmail: csh3@york.ac.uk\nReferences\nAgrawal, D.P., 1982.
