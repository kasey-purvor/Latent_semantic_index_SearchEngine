Garner, Jr 2\nIf he loves justice . . . the \u2018scholar\u2019 of the future, the\n\u2018intellectual\u2019 of tomorrow should learn it and from\nthe ghost. He should learn to live by learning not\nhow to make conversation with the ghost but how\nto talk to him, with her, how to let them speak or\nto give them back speech, even if it is in oneself, in\nthe other, in the other in oneself; they are always\nthere, spectres, even if they do not exist, even if\nthey are no longer, even if they are not yet. \nJacques Derrida3\nToday everyone who values cities is disturbed by\nautomobiles.\nJane Jacobs4\nALTHOUGH his practice resists easy defini-\ntion, combining playwriting, composing,\nwalking, and sonic installation art, Graeme\nMiller is consistent in his attempts to use\nperformance as a barometer of the everyday,\na way of gauging the temperature of the\ntimes. Much of his work is interventionist in\na direct, site-specific sense. He has installed\nsound observatories to record what the\nMarxist philosopher Henri Lefebvre calls\n\u2018the music of the city\u2019;5 collaborated with the\ninhabitants of these cities by making work\nfrom their experiences of space; and sent his\naudience (if we can still use that worn-out\nword in this context) on guided walks\nthrough a variety of urban landscapes. \nMiller\u2019s interest in the city as a site of per-\nformance has much in common with contem-\nporary currents in ethnology and sociology.\nIn this essay I want to explore those parallels\nby focusing on Linked,6 an on-going work\nthat was commissioned by the Museum of\nLondon as part of its urban art collection in\n2003.7 The essay unfolds in three stages. In\nthe first, I relate Miller\u2019s performance prac-\ntice to developments in urban theory, paying\nparticular attention to the concept of every-\nday life as theorized by Henri Lefebvre and\nMichel de Certeau. In the second, I provide a\nperformative account of my experience of\nwalking Linked in the summer of 2004.8 In the\nthird stage, I argue that Linked offers an alter-\nnative paradigm for political performance.\n148 ntq 21:2 (may 2005) \u00a9 cambridge university press doi: 10.1017\/s0266464x05000059\nCarl Lavery\nThe Pepys of London E11:\nGraeme Miller and the Politics of Linked\nIn 2003, Graeme Miller was commissioned by the Museum of London to produce a site-\nspecific artwork for its oral history collection. Miller responded by creating Linked, a\nperformance which bears witness to the disastrous impact the M11 link road has had\non his local neighbourhood since its construction in the 1990s. Helped by a team of\nresearchers, Miller interviewed local citizens and road protesters and broadcast their\ntestimonies from twenty transmitters that line the route of the link road. In order to activate\nthe work, the participant borrows a headset from a local library and is invited to follow the\nlink road from Hackney to Wanstead, a distance of roughly four miles. This article explores\nthe politics of Linked from a number of different theoretical perspectives: contemporary\nethnography, everyday life studies, urban theory, and Situationism. The objective is to\nshow that Linked offers an alternative paradigm for political performance \u2013 a paradigm\nwhich also necessitates an idiosyncratic and subjective form of writing. The article is\nfollowed by an interview in which Miller speaks about the processes involved in making\nLinked. Carl Lavery teaches performance and theatre at Loughborough University.\nSiting Linked\nLinked is part of a series of multi-disciplinary\nworks on the city that Miller, a founding\nmember of the influential Impact Theatre\nCo-operative, has been producing for more\nthan a decade. These include The Sound\nObservatory (1992), a sonic map that traces\nthe hidden rhythms and sounds of Birming-\nham; The Desire Paths (1993), a play in which\nfive characters stumble through an apoca-\nlyptic urban wasteland with the help of an\nA to Z; Feet of Memory, Boots of Nottingham\n(1995), a sound installation documenting the\nmemories of seventy citizens who walked\nthe city in the course of a day; Lost Sound\n(2001), a film, made in collaboration with\nJohn Smith, in which Miller reconstructed\nhis East London neighbourhood from cas-\nsette tapes discarded in the street; Dilston\nGrove (2003), a photosynthetic work, com-\nmissioned by the London International\nFestival of Theatre (LIFT), where Miller\u2019s\nsoundtrack accompanied Heather Ackroyd\u2019s\nand Dan Harvey\u2019s grass-filled church in Ber-\nmondsey, South London; and, most recently,\nBassline (2004), which constructs an alter-\nnative map of Vienna from the recorded\nconversations of eleven participants who\ntravelled through the city with a camera\nwhile followed by a double-bass player.\nLike the performances mentioned above,\nLinked has no interest in fiction. Its purpose is\nto offer an alternative history of Miller\u2019s\nneighbourhood in East London, which was\nravaged \u2013 indeed, literally torn apart \u2013 by the\nconstruction of the M11 link road in the early\nto mid-1990s. The work, then, is a form of\nresistance, a sonic memorial to the families\nwho lived in the five hundred houses that\nwere forcibly requisitioned and demolished\nso that commuters could reach the nearby\nCity of London in time for work. \nTo combat the amnesia of the present,\nMiller lined the four-mile route of the link\nroad with twenty transmitters that broadcast\na haunting mixture of music, ambient sounds,\nand personal memories of those who once\nlived in the now vanished streets. To partake\nin the performance, the participant borrows \na map and a receiver (a headset that looks \nand acts like a Walkman) from one of the\nlocal libraries in the boroughs of Hackney\nand Wanstead, and uses it to navigate his\/\nher way through the urban landscape\u2019\nthrough the urban landscape.\nIn the publicity that accompanies the work,\nLinked is defined as \u2018a landmark in sound, an\ninvisible artwork, a walk\u2019.10 And it is not\ndifficult to understand why. Although the\nwork is rigorously sited \u2013 the location is\nthe meaning \u2013 the site is absent, situated\nsomewhere in the air above, or the ground\nbeneath, the busy grey tarmac of the new\nroad that rumbles noisily in the near dis-\ntance. This invisibility, this erasure, is what\nMiller wants to contest. His sonic memorial\nhaunts the road, reminding those who listen\nto the personal testimonies on the headset\nthat this anonymous passage de conduite was\nonce a dwelling place, a site of community.\nBy making a visit to the site a prerequisite\nfor the work, Miller transforms his perfor-\nmance into a civic practice in and by itself. To\nwalk Linked is to become a part of the city, a\nwitness to its processes, events, rhythms, and\nhistories.\nPerformance, Ethnography, and Resistance\nMiller\u2019s site-specific work encourages us to\nengage with the urban environment in which\nwe are placed. Confronted with a perfor-\nmance like Linked, the vocabulary of theatre\nstudies, with its emphasis on script, audi-\ntorium, and neat separation between actors\nand spectators, suddenly seems old, unable\nto deal with the collapse of boundaries that\n149\nMiller insists on. If the discourse of drama\nstudies can no longer account for Miller\u2019s\nwork, then we need to look elsewhere. Eth-\nnography provides a more suitable language\nfor getting to grips with Miller\u2019s art. Con-\ntemporary ethnography, of the sort practised\nby James Clifford, is a discipline that tries to\nunderstand cultural processes \u2018from a stand-\npoint of participant observation\u2019, \u2018situated\nknowledge\u2019, and \u2018self-reflexive writing\u2019.11\nOne way of understanding this self-reflexive\nand critical form of ethnography is to see it\nas a form of witnessing through empirical\nimmersion, a means of arriving at the general\nthrough the particular, the macro through\nthe micro.12\nEthnography\u2019s attempt to interpret ways\nof life and cultural trends through direct\nobservation is exactly what Miller seeks to\ndo when he sends his participants through\nthe East End of London with a map and a\nheadset.13 As you walk along the route from\nHackney to Wanstead, listening to the testi-\nmonies of the evicted and the re-located, it\nbecomes impossible not to think about larger\nquestions to do with life-style, public space,\nand what it means to be a citizen. To that\nextent, Miller invites us to practise \u2013 to per-\nform \u2013 what Marc Aug\u00e9 calls \u2018an ethnology\nof supermodernity\u2019.14 According to Aug\u00e9,\nsuch an ethnology can only ever be \u2018an eth-\nnology of solitude\u2019, for, in today\u2019s society of\nretail parks, home entertainment systems,\nand \u2018real time\u2019, the subject is physically iso-\nlated from his\/her community, and radically\nalone. \nIn the influential Non-Places: an Introduction\nto an Anthropology of Supermodernity (1992),\nAug\u00e9 stresses the role that spatial practices\nhave played in the production of super-\nmodern anomie. For Aug\u00e9, we live at a time in\nthe West when place (the realm of history,\nidentity, and dwelling) has been superseded\nby non-place (the realm of atemporality,\nanonymity and passage):\nIn one form or another, ranging from the misery\nof refugee camps to the cosseted luxury of five-\nstar hotels, some experience of non-place (indis-\nsociable from a more or less clear perception of\nthe acceleration of history and the contraction of\nthe planet) is today an essential component of all\nsocial existence. Hence the very particular and\nultimately paradoxical character of what is some-\ntimes regarded in the West as the fashion for\n\u2018cocooning\u2019, retreating into the self. . . . The com-\nmunity of human destinies is experienced in the\nanonymity of non-place, and in solitude.15\nIf Linked is a performance that encourages its\nparticipants to reflect on contemporary\nspatial practices in the West, it also invites us\nto think about how that culture experiences\ntime. According to Paul Virilio, the shift from\nplace to non-place that Aug\u00e9 maps is con-\nsonant with our addiction to speed \u2013 our\ndesire for faster roads, better computer\nservers, instant communication. In Virilio\u2019s\nview, speed institutes a process of collective\nforgetting. How can you find time to\nremember the past when things are so quick\nthat you cannot deal with the present? \nAs a consequence of our obsession with\nspeed, Virilo argues that we are on the brink\nof an apocalypse. Citing Walter Benjamin\u2019s\nwell-known interpretation of Paul Klee\u2019s\npainting Angelus Nova (1920), Virilio depres-\nsingly concludes that \u2018today this theological\nvision no longer belongs to the angel of\nhistory. It has become the vision of each and\nevery one of us.\u201916\nWhile Miller\u2019s work encourages the par-\nticipant to experience, and then reflect on,\nthe cultural significance of space and time,\nhe is not content to use performance merely\nto reveal these processes.17 He wants to resist\nthem. Speaking of his play The Desire Paths in\nan interview with the Guardian newspaper in\n1993, Miller observes: \nWe live at a time when people increasingly\nexpress the feeling that the world outside our\nwindows is a dangerous and fragmented place.\nOnce upon a time people walked through the city\nand it gave them a chance to name places and\nmake contact with each other. Each individual has\na different map of the city. But humans need to\nmark their lives against real space and other people.\nWhen they cease to walk, the real spaces become\nless plausible then than the centralized reality of\nthe media and are increasingly witnessed as a\npassing blur from a car window. They become\nabandoned, the haunts of the disturbed.18\nThese comments provide an explicit insight\ninto Miller\u2019s performance practice. If super-\n150\nmodernity deprives place of memory and com-\nmunity \u2013 and what could be more destruc-\ntive of these things than a motorway? \u2013 then\nperformance, Miller argues, ought to find a\nway of contesting this erasure by providing\nalternative methods for humanizing space. \nMiller underlines his commitment to a\npolitics of lived space in the essay \u2018Country\nDance\u2019 (2000).19 Crucially in this text he does\nnot define himself as an artist, but as a\ncartographer interested in making the \u2018odd\nmap to keep checking out what\u2019s what. To\nremind us that there is complex and subtle\nlife out there. To reveal the singular, ineffable\nbits.\u2019 20 His performance maps are designed\nfor purposes of resistance. They are meant to\nreclaim place from the desert of non-place\nand, in the process, serve as monuments\nagainst forgetting. With the help of these\nmaps, the city becomes a site for creative\nliving and affective encounter, not simply\nsomething we pass through at top speed. \nTo that extent, Miller\u2019s performance work\nis part of an avant-garde tradition which, as\nPeter B\u00fcrger argues in Theory of the Avant-\nGarde (1974), attacks the Modernist idea of art\nas an activity or transcendence divorced from\nlife itself. For Miller, as for B\u00fcrger, art is a\nsocial praxis:\nHaving paced around the perimeter of a world\nwhich I questioned little and have spent years\naway from, I sense a yawning gap between Art\nand Culture. The City is built on the vernacular of\nshopping and now, Art is too. Art needs to be built\non a thriving culture, not on its own ironic view of\nits own marketplace. Culture is the thick layer;\nArt the thin \u2013 the curious and beautiful distil-\nlation. The sooner Art gets itself a Culture on\nwhich to rest, the sooner it will feel good to be an\nartist and the less important whether you are one\nor not.21\nThe Politics of Pedestrian Performance\nMiller\u2019s attempt to re-appropriate urban space\nfor humanist purposes situates his work in\nthe non-heroic terrain of what Henri Lefebvre\nterms \u2018everyday life\u2019, the space where, in\nLefebvre\u2019s view, alienation is most keenly\nfelt because of its silent intimacy, its invisible\nproximity. Philip Wander provides a succinct\ndefinition of the Lefebvrian notion of every-\nday life in his \u2018Introduction\u2019 to the English\ntranslation of Lefebvre\u2019s key text Everyday\nLife in the Modern World (1968):\n151\n\u2018Everyday life\u2019 refers to dull routine, the ongoing\ngo-to-work, pay-the-bills, homeward trudge of\ndaily existence. It indicates a sense of being in the\nworld beyond philosophy, virtually beyond the\ncapacity of language to describe, that we know\nsimply as the grey reality enveloping all we do.22\nDespite its seeming inconsequentiality \u2013 \u2018the\ngrey reality enveloping all we do\u2019\u2013 everyday\nlife provides a privileged access to political\nreality. The micro-acts and small-scale experi-\nences that constitute the everyday reflect\nlarger macro-processes that are occurring else-\nwhere.23 The act of driving alone in a car, for \ninstance, demonstrates the lonely isolation of\nthe contemporary individual better than any\ntheoretical text ever could: it provides empi-\nrical proof that supermodern individuality \u2013\nthe right to go where we want, when we\nwant \u2013 entails separation from others and\nreinforces solitude. \nTo assent to that notion of individuality,\nthen, is not just a personal act, it implicates\nthe subject in a network of ideological mean-\nings and assumptions. Or, as Aug\u00e9 puts\nit, \u2018never before have individual histories\n(because of their necessary relations with\nspace, image, and consumption) been so\ndeeply entangled with general history, with\nhistory, tout court\u2019.24 Yet if everyday life is the\nspace where anomie is experienced concretely,\nit is equally, Lefebvre claims, the site where\nthat anomie is best resisted. Revolting against\nthe alienation of everyday life \u2013 in an urban\ncontext, reasserting what Lefebvre claims is\nour right to the city \u2013 is a liberating process:\nit releases us from the depressing drudgery\nand invisible discipline that pervades all\naspects of everyday life.25\nMiller\u2019s method for using art as an every-\nday strategy is to rely on the walk. Walking is\nwell suited for this purpose because it allows\nus, as the French sociologist Michel de Certeau\nsuggests in the influential The Practices of\nEveryday Life (1974), to see things at ground\nlevel and to experience events and sensations\nthat maps and images of the city always miss\nin their quest for totality and spectacle:26\nThe ordinary practitioners of the city live \u2018down\nbelow\u2019, below the thresholds at which visibility\nbegins. They walk \u2013 an elementary form of this\nexperience of the city; they are walkers, Wanders-\nm\u00e4nner, whose bodies follow the thins of an urban\ntext they write without being able to read.27\nThe final line of this passage is important: it\ninforms us that everyday life is not some-\nthing that can be adequately represented in a\ntext, or read passively at a distance. It is not\nan object to be consumed, a commodity, a\nspectacle. On the contrary, everyday life, in\nde Certeau\u2019s terms, is constituted through a\nseries of practices: chance encounters, affec-\ntive energy-flows, brief conversations, and\nephemeral gestures. To get to grips with\neveryday life, we have to be part of it, to\nexperience it, engage with it. Walking per-\nmits this type of embodied knowledge, this\nform of concrete participation, because it\ncompels the walker to be physically present\nin the space s\/he observes. In this way, every-\nday life reveals itself through smells, sounds,\nsights, tastes, intensities, and the rhythms of\nthe body.28\nAs well as being an ideal strategy for wit-\nnessing, walking is also productive of every-\nday life. It is no coincidence, for instance,\nthat de Certeau refers to walking as a speech\nact, a performative utterance: \u2018The act of\nwalking is to the urban system what the\nspeech act is to language or to statements\nuttered. . . . It is a spatial acting-out of\nplace.\u2019 29 For de Certeau the city, like signi-\nfication in general, is neither fixed nor stable:\nit is brought into being because it is prac-\ntised, because people walk through it. To\nwalk the city is to rewrite it, to appropriate it\nfor yourself. Thus, no proper, official version\n152\nof the city exists. We all own it:\nIf it is true that forests of gestures are manifest in\nthe street, their movement cannot be captured in a\npicture, nor can the meaning of their movements\nbe circumscribed in a text. Their rhetorical trans-\nplantation carries away and displaces the analy-\ntical, coherent proper meanings of urbanism: it\nconstitutes a \u2018wandering of the semantic\u2019 pro-\nduced by masses that make some parts of the city\ndisappear and exaggerate others, distorting it,\nfragmenting it, and diverting it from its immobile\norder.30\nThe similarities between de Certeau\u2019s uto-\npian vision of pedestrianism and Miller\u2019s\nperformance practice become evident when\nwe look at how Miller understands the urban\nenvironment. Like de Certeau, Miller sees\nthe city in linguistic terms as a text that is\nendlessly rewritten by the pedestrians mov-\ning through it: \nEverything is language and makes its own shapes\nand squiggles. The landscape throws out rushes\nof calligraphy and is constantly rewriting itself.\nEvery moment we are composing ourselves and\nour world. A social culture is strings of these com-\npositions which are agreed to be shared.31\nFor Miller, culture is spatial and space is\nproduced through practice. So by sending\nhis participants on a walk through the city,\nhe allows them to engage in an act of poiesis,\nwhich, as de Certeau points out, means to\n\u2018create, invent, [and] generate\u2019.32 In the\nprocess, he troubles the logic of a society that\nassociates art with the esoteric activities of\n\u2018specialists\u2019 (writers, painters, actors), not\nwith the everyday practices of ordinary indi-\nviduals. Or, to repeat Miller\u2019s comments\nfrom Country Dance: \u2018The sooner Art gets\nitself a Culture on which to rest, the sooner it\nwill feel good to be an artist and the less\nimportant whether you are one or not.\u2019\nA Note on Representation\nMiller\u2019s desire to engage the participant of\nLinked in a process of creative collaboration\nhas important consequences for the objective\nwriting, the impersonal voice of the third\nperson, which is conventionally associated\nwith academic discourse. For if Miller, like\nde Certeau, insists that the urban text is\nproduced from the practices of individual\nWandersm\u00e4nner, then how can there be an\nobjective and\/or authoritative account of\nLinked? Surely, everybody will respond to the\nwork differently and rewrite it according to\nhis experiences and\/or background? \nIn order to respect the logic of that\nposition, I have tried to write about Linked, in\nthe pages that follow, as subjectively as\npossible. I have done so by dividing my\naccount into three separate sections: the way\nof the stranger; the way of the witness; and\nthe way of the citizen. I use the word \u2018way\u2019\nhere to refer to (a) an act of walking; (b) a type\nof experience; and (c) a method of reflection.\nThis attempt to appropriate language, to\nwrite in the first person, is not motivated by\na desire to obfuscate or to prevent dialogue.\nOn the contrary, it is intended to enlarge\nmeaning by encouraging the participants of\nLinked to compare and contrast their experi-\nence of the work with mine. The real, the\ndream of objectivity, is never abandoned.\nRather it is re-imagined as something created\nthrough active dialogue, through difference.\nTo that extent, my rewriting of Linked is a\npractice in itself, a method for remaking the\neveryday. A final point: the ways I have\nsuggested below are my own. Other subjects\nwill discover alternative paths and take\ndifferent roads.\nThe Way of the Stranger (Space)\nLinked engaged me in a manner that con-\nventional performance rarely does. Walking\nthe four miles from the Lee Valley Park in\nHackney to Redbridge Lane in Wanstead\nhad more in common with an act of pilgrim-\nage than with going to the theatre. There\nwere no actors to gaze at, no building to\nenter, and no object to consume. The whole\npurpose of the performance was to bear\nwitness to an act of real destruction, to listen\nto the voices of the departed, to resist the all-\nconquering claims of car culture.\nLinked demands a sacrifice, an investment.\nYou have to walk the route. You are obliged\nto put in the hours. Your feet suffer. You\n153\nsweat. In a world of pure speed, a world\nwhere time is money, the six hours I spent\nwalking, listening, and observing seemed\nextravagant, wasteful, sacred. I was part of a\ndifferent economy, acutely aware of how this\nperformance, this walk, was distancing me\nfrom the world of work, utility, and speed:\nthe world of the car \u2013 the world of the link\nroad. I felt alienated, marginalized, con-\nscious of not working, of taking my time, of\ndoing something different in the city. The\nperformance had efficacy: it affected me. But\nwhy did it make me feel so strange?\nThe performance theorist Allan Kaprow\nprovides a good explanation for this. Accord-\ning to him, performance that erases the\nboundaries between art and everyday life\ndisturbs us more than performance that\ninsists on maintaining its autonomy from the\nworld. In happenings and invisible perfor-\nmance events, Kaprow argues, objects lose\ntheir meaning and migrate from their proper\nplace. We realize then that reality is pro-\nvisional and that what we do to space affects\nits meaning, its identity. Since existence is\nalways sited in space and time, this inevit-\nably affects the participant\u2019s sense of self:\nSuch displacements of ordinary emphasis increase\nattentiveness . . . to the peripheral parts of our-\nselves and our surroundings. Revealed in this way\nthey are strange. Participants could feel momen-\ntarily separated from themselves.33\nKaprow was right. When I walked Linked,\nI felt self-conscious, not at home, \u2018separated\nfrom myself\u2019. London had lost its \u2018hardness\u2019\nand \u2018gone soft\u2019. It had become a dream space,\nan \u2018unreal city\u2019 . . . \nThe stories I heard on the receiver heigh-\ntened the strangeness, fed the dream. The\nsonic skein that Miller spins over the city\ndislocates consciousness. The memories and\nsounds entering my ears conflicted with the\ndata processed by my eyes. Where my ears\nrecreated a vanished world of gardens, child-\nren playing in the streets, and snow in the\ncity, my eye stubbornly insisted on what was\nstill there: the motorway. Past and present\nmerged; imaginative reality competed with\neveryday reality. \nMy disorientation was increased by the\nperformance of the interviewees. Although\nthe testimonies are about the past (hiding out\nin the Territorial Army Centre in Leytonstone\nin the 1950s, dancing to soul music at the\nFlamingo Club in the 1970s, protesting\nagainst the link road in the 1990s), they are\nall delivered as if they were happening just\nnow, in the present.34 This suspension of time\nis estranging: the past haunts the present,\ndoubling it, and ultimately dislocating it\nfrom itself. The curator and writer Alan Read\nexperienced a similar blast of strangeness: \nCharged with narrative yes, reminiscence maybe,\ngossip and rumour perhaps, but in Linked there is\nan invitation to come back down to earth, to walk,\nto encourage a pedestrian in the presence of the\nautomobile, to engage with two presents. The pre-\nsent that is the first-person narrative of the speaker\nspeaking, now in a present that must have been\nback then, at least eight years if the words are to\nbe taken at face value. A second present that is the\ninsistent present of the landscape transformed.\nAnd between these two presents a tension, held\nlike a refrain from a faraway room, of the sound of\nmemories coming into being just long enough for\nthem to fail again in the forgetting of the insistent\ndemands of time.35\nAlthough Read talks of time, the voices on\nthe headset affected me spatially. I had the\nsensation of belonging to the world and yet\nbeing simultaneously outside it. I felt limi-\nnal. Neither here nor there, betwixt and bet-\nween. More attuned to absence (the voices\non the headset) than presence (the pedes-\ntrians that passed me). I was dislocated.\nThe strangeness was not all about the\nvoices, though. Throughout the performance\nI was acutely aware of being an outsider.\nWearing a headset, carrying a map, and\ntrying to tune in to a transmitter invariably\ntransforms you into an object of attention\nPassers-by looked at me strangely, trying to\nfigure me out, seeking to understand what I\nwas doing. In Leyton, a builder eyed me\nsuspiciously as I was trying to tune into a\ntransmitter at the junction between Colville\nRoad and Grove Green Road; in Kingswood\nRoad in Leytonstone, a young woman came\nout of her house to watch me, and in Wan-\nstead, just off the ironically named Green\n154\nMan Roundabout (there was nothing pagan\nor green about this roundabout), a mother\nand her three children scrutinized me sitting\nunder a transmitter. I wondered if these\npeople thought I was a policeman, a Depart-\nment of Health and Social Security officer, a\nprivate detective, or a spy. I had become\nparanoid, unsure of my place. \nIn Linked, space is not a passive substance,\na mere receptacle. It disorientates; it chal-\nlenges your perspective on the world; it\ncomes alive. You cannot consume it as a\ntourist would \u2013 that is to say, as an image or\nas something passive. On the contrary, space\naffects you; it troubles your ego by position-\ning you as the stranger, the one who does not\nbelong.36 You are catapulted out of the\nknown, forced to leave home, opened to the\nother. As with every act of pilgrimage, an\nevent takes place in the four miles between\nHackney and Wanstead. Something changes,\nalters, shifts . . . \nThe Way of the Witness (Ethics)\nTo perform Linked is to consent to a haunting,\nto agree to walk in a city of ghosts. The\nphantasmic voices broadcast by the trans-\nmitters weave a dream blanket of memory\nand reminiscence over the East End. They\nchallenge reality as it is, reminding the soli-\ntary walker that the link road which now\ncuts through the neighbourhood was once\nfilled with streets, houses, and trees, a place\nwhere people lived and shared experience. \nListening to these \u2018foreign correspondents\nfrom the past\u2019 unhinged me.37 I felt melan-\ncholic, haunted by absence, surrounded by\nloss. I imagined the voices taking shape, fill-\ning space, living out an existence that had\nnow gone. For all their distance, they seemed\nintimate, within reach. Their stories touched\nme. I was responsible for their memories, con-\nnected to them.\nIn the epigram from Spectres of Marx: the\nState of the Debt, the Work of Mourning, and the\nNew International (1993) which opens this\nessay, Jacques Derrida talks about the special\ntype of listening required if we are to com-\nmunicate with ghosts. The striking thing\nabout his injunction is that we are urged not\nto \u2018make conversation\u2019 with ghosts; rather he\nwants us \u2018to let them speak\u2019 so that we can\ndiscover \u2018the other in oneself\u2019. For Derrida,\nthe dislocation caused by the passing of the\nghost is vital: it gets to the very core of ethics,\nwhich, in his view, is bound up with notions\nof inheritance and witnessing:\nThat we are heirs does not mean that we have or\nthat we receive this or that, some inheritance that\nenriches us one day with this or that, but that the\nbeing of what we are is first of all inheritance,\nwhether we like it or know it or not. And that, as\nH\u00f6lderin said so well, we can only bear witness to\nit. To bear witness would be to bear witness to what\nwe are insofar as we inherit and that \u2013 here is the\ncircle, here is the chance or finitude \u2013 we inherit the\nvery thing that allows us to bear witness to it.38\nDerrida\u2019s ideas provide a useful perspective\non why Linked exerts such a strong if un-\ncanny ethical pull. For if we accept Derrida\u2019s\nargument that the ghost\u2019s capacity to alter\nsubjectivity is what transforms us from dis-\ninterested spectators into witnesses, then by\nplacing us in contact with spectres, in this\ncontext, with people and places that are no\nlonger there, Miller raises questions of value\nand justice. In Derrida\u2019s terms, he asks the\nnaive, yet crucial question, of how to live.\nSomeone, you or me, comes forward and says: I\nwould like to learn to live finally. . . . To learn to\nlive: a strange watchword. Who would learn?\nFrom whom? To teach to live, but to whom. Will\nwe ever know? Will we ever know how to live\nand first of all what to \u2018learn to live\u2019 means? And\nwhy \u2018finally\u2019?39\n155\nIn Linked, blunt questions have far-reaching\nconsequences. I started to see the link road as\nsomething emblematic, which, like the pur-\nloined letter in Edgar Alan Poe\u2019s famous\nshort story, conceals the very thing it makes\nmanifest. Why, for instance, are individuals\nand communities routinely sacrificed for\ngreater ease of access? Why this addiction to\nspeed? Why the car? Why profit? How did\nwe reach this point? Because it poses these\nquestions, Linked stands as the conscience of\ncapital, a performance that keeps the past\nalive, marking the traces of the dispatched\nand disappeared.\nHowever, while Linked pays witness to\nwhat has gone, it is no exercise in nostalgia. I\nfelt uplifted after walking Linked. As I left to\ntake my train back to Kings Cross, the small\npedestrianized square in front of Leyton-\nstone Tube Station heaved with people in a\nriot of language and colour. The neighbour-\nhood was on the mend, healing itself from\nthe wounds inflicted by the road a mere fifty\nmetres away across the bridge. This renewal\nof language, this rediscovery of community,\nis what Miller wants his spectral art, his con-\njuring trick, to contribute to: \nWe read and write ourselves into the landscape,\nour own narrative overlapping with our neigh-\nbours. Yet I cannot fit my house back into its foot-\nprint (now space above the road). It is a surface\nthat will no longer host my decade of life in Grove\nGreen Road. As the particles of speech of Linked\nface the future there lies a hope that they will con-\nnect with triggered rememberings, counter-stories,\nand gross omissions and alternative versions of\nthe same event that may renew the narrative\ntissue of the neighborhood.40\nThe futural hope that Miller places in memory,\nin the dislocated time of the spectre, brings to\nmind Derrida\u2019s claim in Spectres of Marx that\nto \u2018talk with or about some ghost\u2019 is to \u2018ask\nthe question \u201cwhere?\u201d, \u201cwhere tomorrow?\u201d,\n\u201cwhither?\u201d\u201941 By inviting us to speak to ghosts,\nMiller opens his work to a different absence \u2013\nthe absence of those who have still to inherit.\nFor reasons such as these, Linked can be profit-\nably seen as a work of mourning. The sad-\nness it evokes is galvanizing, producing what\nAvery Gordon calls \u2018transformative recog-\n156\nnition\u2019.42 That is, recognition that alters the\ncommunity allowing it to become something\nnew, something different.\nThe Way of the Citizen (Politics)\nLinked is a profoundly political piece that\nbears witness to the attempts of the local\ncommunity and a dedicated band of eco-\nwarriors to block the construction of the M11\nlink road in the early to mid-1990s. Like The\nBattle of Orgreave (2001), Jeremy Deller\u2019s re-\nenactment of the pivotal clash between the\nminers and the police in the strike of 1984,\nLinked offers an alternative perspective on\nrecent history: it reminds the listener that\ndebate and protest, despite the claims of neo-\nliberal thinkers, have not disappeared in the\nlast twenty years and that reality is still open\nto debate and change. The utopianism of the\nperiod is evident in the narrative of an activist\nwho told how the local postman continued\nto deliver letters to his tree-house during the\nprotests and how a retired RAF pilot, living\nin the houses opposite the common, left him\nhalf-bottles of whisky when it was cold.\nDespite the failure of the protests \u2013 the\npresence of the link road is an all-too con-\nstant reminder of that \u2013 I was impressed by\nthe exuberance and fortitude in the voices of\nthe people recorded. It was apparent that the\nprotest movement had been a defining\nmoment in their lives. Deciding to resist\ngovernment policy had politicized them,\nempowered them, made them more daring.\nThe transmitter that stands sentinel on Wan-\nstead Common, for instance, broadcasts the\nstory of Jean, the Welsh lollipop lady, who,\nalong with local schoolchildren and teachers,\nstopped the contractors from destroying a\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-year-old chestnut tree\non the common. Participating in a communal\naction allowed local residents like Jean to\nescape from the isolation of their living\nrooms \u2013 what Marc Aug\u00e9 calls \u2018cocooning\u2019 \u2013\nand to constitute themselves as a civic body,\na community. For citizens of the short-lived\nrepublics of Wanstonia and Leytonstonia, the\ncity was exactly what the non-space of the\nlink road was about to threaten: a public\nrealm, a space where strangers were not only\nencountered but embraced.43\nAs I listened to these narratives, I became\nconscious of how they contradicted the spec-\ntacular images of metropolitan life that rep-\nresent the inner city as a jungle, a landscape\n157\nWays of the stranger and of the citizen. Opposite page: Blake Road (note the transmitter on the lamp post on the\nright of the picture). Above: Wanstead Common.\nof danger and fear. In Linked, by contrast, the\nstreets of Hackney and Wanstead are remem-\nbered by people who lived there as sites of\nopenness and civility. To that extent, Linked\nechoes Jane Jacobs\u2019s warning about car cul-\nture in her classic book The Death and Life of\nGreat American Cities: the Failure of Town\nPlanning (1961). According to Jacobs, cities are\nnot dangerous because they are filled with\nmasses of strangers; rather, they are dangerous\nwhen they prevent people from meeting:\nStreets in cities serve many purposes besides\ncarrying vehicles. . . . Streets and their sidewalks,\nthe main public places of a city, are its most vital\norgans. . . . To keep the city safe is a fundamental\ntask of a city\u2019s streets and its sidewalks.44\nJacobs\u2019s comments underline the sophistica-\ntion of Miller\u2019s performance practice. Linked\nis not simply a political work because it\nrepresents an actual political event: its poli-\ntical value resides, ultimately, in its practical\ndimension. In Linked, stopping for a coffee,\nasking for directions en route, and buying\nfood and water in local shops are significant\nacts: they provide an opportunity for conver-\nsation. And, as de Certeau reminds us, con-\nversation is what socializes space:\nConversation is a provisional and collective effect\nof competence in the art of manipulating \u2018com-\nmonplaces\u2019 and the inevitability of events in such\na way as to make them \u2018habitable\u2019.45\nA Paradigm for Political Performance\nThe speech that Linked inevitably gives rise\nto reveals the political essence of civitas to be\nneither dependent on juridical law nor on\nideological consistency, but rather on our\nability to live with \u2013 and respect \u2013 others who\nare not affiliated to us by ties of kinship or\nsubstantive notions of community (Gemein-\nschaft). In this way, Linked practises what the\nurban sociologist Richard Sennett has argued\nin numerous publications from The Fall of\nPublic Man: on the Social Psychology of Capital-\nism (1974) to Respect in a World of Inequality\n(2003): namely, that city living, the politics of\nthe polis, is grounded in our ability to live\nwith strangers in public spaces that encour-\nage encounter and debate.\nIn the pages above, I have responded to\nMiller\u2019s invitation to rewrite Linked from a\npersonal perspective. I have done so by\nstressing the existential, ethical, and political\nsignificance it had for me. In the final section,\nI want to argue that Linked\u2019s practical dimen-\nsion \u2013 the fact that the everyday is experi-\nenced as an empirical event \u2013 offers an\nalternative paradigm that has much in com-\nmon with the aesthetic and political pro-\ngramme of the Situationists. \nFor the Situationists, art is neither a vica-\nrious experience nor a mere functional tool.\nRather, art \u2013 and in particular theatre \u2013 has\nthe capacity to explode the logic of the society\nof the spectacle, which, according to Guy\nDebord, Situationism\u2019s main theorist, is based\non the twin evils of separation (keeping people\napart) and specialization (perpetuating hierar-\nchies of people). Art that has renounced the\npage, stage, and gallery has the potential to\nbe a revolutionary practice, argues Debord,\nbecause, in an age of abundance, cultural\nproduction is more important than economic\nproduction.46 In a post-industrial, service eco-\nnomy, the crucial battle is for the mind of the\nmasses, and this battle, Debord maintains,\ntakes place at the level of the spectacle, the\nimage: \u2018The spectacle is not a collection of\nimages; rather, it is a social relationship bet-\nween people that is mediated by images.\u201947\nIn the society \u2018mediated by images\u2019, spec-\ntatorship is politically reactionary, for it is\nthis activity, above all else, claims Debord,\nthat produces alienation and isolation: \nThe spectacle\u2019s externality with respect to the act-\ning subject is demonstrated by the fact that the\nindividual\u2019s own gestures are no longer his own,\nbut rather those of someone else who represents\nthem to him.48\nIf controlling cultural consumption, situat-\ning the subject as spectator, is the essence of\npolitical domination, then activating cultural\nproduction on a mass scale, producing a\nsociety of performers, is, Debord believes,\nthe key to cultural and political change. For\nhow can the spectacle function if the masses\nprefer to remake the world actively rather\nthan to watch it passively on the screen or\nmonitor in front of them? \n158\nDebord contends that this shift from con-\nsumption to production can occur by subject-\ning everyday life to a process of d\u00e9tournement\nor imaginative hijacking. Situationists attempt\nto d\u00e9tourner the world by creating situations\n\u2013 public performances \u2013 that subvert reality\nfrom the inside, in the here and now. The\ncrucial point about d\u00e9tournement is that art is\nnot used to transcend the everyday; rather\nthe everyday is used to transcend art. Or to\nput it differently: to live is to create and to\ncreate is to live. There is no need for a pro-\nduct or commodity, no space for a spectacle. \nThe notion of d\u00e9tournement describes, with\nsome accuracy, what Miller is trying to do in\nLinked. By installing transmitters on a four-\nmile stretch of the M11 link road and inviting\nparticipants, many of whom are strangers to\nthe area, to walk the route, Miller transforms\na motorway into a work of art, a site where\nimaginative production takes place. In the\nprocess, he re-appropriates space (the place\nof encounter and dialogue) from the desert\nof non-space (the isolation caused by cars on\na motorway). \nThe everyday is no longer a site of misery\nbut a source of creativity. Just as importantly,\nthe separation caused by the motorway \u2013 the\nfact that it physically blocks communication\nwith other people \u2013 has been used to develop\nnew forms of encounter with Wandersm\u00e4nner\nwho drift through the local community and\nproduce social space with every step they\ntake. Linked is a situation, an act of creative\nreclamation, a pedestrian performance that\nblurs the boundaries that link art and every-\nday life. To repeat a refrain from Miller that\nhas run throughout this essay:\nThe sooner Art gets itself a Culture on which to\nrest, the sooner it will feel good to be an artist and\nthe less important whether you are one or not . . . \nNotes and References\nI would like to thank Franc Chamberlain, Nicholas\nWhybrow and Ralph Yarrow for commenting on earlier\ndrafts of this essay.
