Radial velocity measurements\nof the Balmer lines and the He I 6678 A\u02da line show that this is a binary white dwarf with\na period of 30.09 d in which the Balmer lines move in anti-phase to the He I line, i.e. PG\n1115+166 is a DA+DB binary. The minimum masses of the stars are MDA = 0.43\u00b10.15 M\u0005\nand MDB = 0.52 \u00b1 0.12 M\u0005. The separation of the stars is about 45 R\u0005, which is much smaller\nthan a typical asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitor of a white dwarf, implying that there\nhas been at least one common envelope phase in this binary. Indeed, it is possible that this\nbinary may have suffered up to three mass transfer episodes \u2013 two associated with the red giant\nphase prior to the formation of each white dwarf, and a third associated with the \u2018born-again\u2019\nred giant phase of the DB white dwarf. PG 1115+166 has the longest orbital period of any\npost common envelope white dwarf\u2013white dwarf binary found to date. Published models for\nthe formation of white dwarf\u2013white dwarf binaries do not predict any white dwarfs with the\ncombination of a long orbital period and high mass found in PG 1115+166. We conclude\nthat PG 1115+166 is a key object for testing models of binary star evolution, and it may also\nbe a key object for our understanding of the formation of DB white dwarfs. We outline the\nobservational tests which can be applied to scenarios for the formation of PG 1115+166 and\napply them to the simplest case of a single common-envelope phase. This suggests that some\npart of the internal energy stored in the envelope of the AGB star, e.g. as ionized hydrogen,\nmay have contributed to the ejection of the common envelope, but there are several unanswered\nquestions concerning this simple scenario.\nKey words: binaries: close \u2013 binaries: spectroscopic \u2013 stars: individual: PG 1115+166 \u2013 white\ndwarfs.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe chemical composition of the atmosphere of a white dwarf star\nreflects a balance between gravitational settling, which tends to pro-\nduce a pure hydrogen atmosphere, and processes which \u2018pollute\u2019 the\natmosphere such as radiative levitation, convection and accretion\n(Fontaine & Wesemael 1987). This balance will change during the\nlifetime of a white dwarf as it cools, and this is seen as a change in\nthe relative numbers of hydrogen-rich (DA) and helium-rich (non-\nDA) white dwarfs as a function of effective temperature. In white\ndwarfs with effective temperatures Teff \u223c 12\u201360 000 K, gravitational\nsettling dominates, so about 80 per cent of these white dwarfs\nhave pure or nearly pure hydrogen atmospheres. White dwarf\nstars with helium-rich atmospheres may appear as DO stars with\nHe I lines (Teff\u0001 45 000 K) or DB stars with He I and He II lines\n(30 000\u0001 Teff\u0001 12 000 K). The absence of non-DA white dwarfs\n\u0003E-mail: pflm@astro.keele.ac.uk\nwith effective temperatures between 30 000 and 45 000 K is known\nas the DB gap. The favoured explanation for the DB gap is that as\nthe DO white dwarf cools to 45 000 K, small amounts of hydrogen\nhidden in the atmosphere rise to the surface, eventually masking\nthe underlying helium. A hydrogen layer mass of just 10\u221214 M\u0005 is\nenough to make the white dwarf look like a DA. Later, at \u223c28 000 K,\nthe convection zone in the underlying helium layer reaches the pho-\ntosphere, mixing the hydrogen and helium so that the white dwarf\nre-appears as a helium-rich, DB white dwarf. Those white dwarfs\nwith thicker hydrogen layers remain as DA stars in this temperature\nrange. In this scenario, \u223c20 per cent of DA white dwarfs within the\nDB gap have thin hydrogen layers which are sufficient to mask the\nunderlying helium.\nThe reason why \u223c20 per cent of white dwarfs are born with very\nthin hydrogen envelopes is thought to be related to the born-again\nred giant phenomenon in which some stars form hot white dwarfs\nwith thick hydrogen envelopes which undergo a late thermal pulse.\nThis is caused by re-ignition of the helium shell which results in\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n834 P. F. L. Maxted et al.\nthe stars rapidly expanding to red giant dimensions, e.g. Sakurai\u2019s\nObject (Duerbeck et al. 2000). The remaining hydrogen is quickly\nmixed into the helium layers and is burnt (Iben et al. 1983).\nThose few white dwarfs which show a mixture of hydrogen and\nhelium in their atmosphere are particularly interesting in the light\nof this debate. About 20 per cent of DB stars show traces of hy-\ndrogen in their atmospheres and are classified as DBA (Shipman,\nLiebert & Green 1987). Much rarer are stars which show both strong\nhydrogen lines and strong helium lines. These are classified as DAB\nstars and only six of them have been identified. The prototype, GD\n323, appears at the cool edge of the DB gap (Teff = 28750 K) and\nappears to have a very thin hydrogen layer (10\u221217 M\u0005) although\nno model can yet explain all the features of this peculiar object\nsatisfactorily (Koester, Liebert & Saffer 1994). MCT 0128\u22123846\nand MCT 0453\u22122933 appear to be binaries with a DA and a DB\nor DBA component (Wesemael et al. 1994). Holberg, Kidder &\nWesemael (1990) detected a weak He I 4471 A\u02da feature in G104\u221227\n(WD 0612+177) but this was not confirmed by subsequent obser-\nvations (Kidder et al. 1992). HS 0209+0832 is a DAB star in the\nmiddle of the DB gap which shows strong He I lines whose strength\nvaries from year-to-year (Heber et al. 1997) which may be explained\nby accretion on to the white dwarf from an inhomogeneous inter-\nstellar cloud (Wolff et al. 2000). Finally, PG 1115+166 was first\nreported as a DAB star by Burleigh et al. (2001). They note that the\nH\u03b1 line shows a variable radial velocity but were unable to deter-\nmine the orbital period. Bergeron & Liebert (2002) have analysed\nthe optical spectrum of PG 1115+166 and found an excellent fit\nto the spectrum by assuming it is an unresolved DA+DB double\ndegenerate binary. Their fit to the observed spectrum used a DA star\nwith Teff = 22 090 K, log g = 8.12 combined with a helium-line DB\nstar with Teff = 16 210 K, log g = 8.19. They estimate that both stars\nhave masses of about 0.7 M\u0005.\nThose DAB stars which are binaries may be particularly inter-\nesting as they may be examples of stars which have undergone two\nmass transfer episodes, e.g. a common envelope phase (Iben & Livio\n1993). The number of such close white dwarf pairs has increased\nrapidly in recent years. The majority of these binaries were identi-\nfied as low mass white dwarfs (\u00020.45 M\u0005) from analysis of their\nBalmer lines. White dwarfs of such low mass are not formed in the\nstandard picture of single star evolution within the lifetime of our\nTable 1.

It now appears that the majority of these binaries are the\nresult of a common envelope phase in a star on the first giant branch\n(Marsh, Dhillon & Duck 1995). The properties of the binaries iden-\ntified to-date, e.g. their orbital periods, masses and mass ratios, are\nstrong tests of models for the formation of close binary white dwarfs\nand models for interacting binary stars in general (Nelemans et al.\n2000, 2001). Identifying DAB stars may be a promising way to\nfind more massive close binary white dwarf stars and so extend the\nrange of masses over which observations can be used to test models\nof interacting binary stars.\nIn this paper we report radial velocity measurements of the Balmer\nlines and He I lines of PG 1115+166. The Balmer lines show that this\nstar is a binary with a period of 30.09 d and the helium lines move in\nanti-phase to the hydrogen lines, so this is star is a DA+DB binary\nwhite dwarf. We also consider the formation of PG 1115+166.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S A N D R E D U C T I O N S\nPG 1115+166 was first identified as a DAB star in 1996 February\nas part of a survey to find low mass white dwarfs (Moran 1999). It\nwas re-observed several times thereafter as part of the programme\nat Southampton to find and characterize close binary white dwarfs.\nThe Leicester group observed PG 1115+166 independently in 1999\nApril as a part of a programme to find white dwarfs with helium-\nrich atmospheres in the DB gap by observing hot white dwarfs\nundetected by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) surveys and also identified\nit as a DAB star (Burleigh et al. 2001)\nObservations of PG 1115+166 have been obtained with the\nintermediate dispersion spectrograph (IDS) on the 2.5-m Isaac\nNewton Telescope (INT) and the dual-beam ISIS spectrograph on\nthe 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT), both on the Island\nof La Palma. A variety of gratings have been used to cover a variety\nof wavelengths at different times, as detailed in Table 1. The expo-\nsure times used were typically 10\u201330 min. Spectra of an arc lamp\nare taken before and after each target spectrum with the telescope\ntracking the star. None of the CCDs used showed any structure\nin unexposed images, so a constant bias level determined from a\nclipped-mean value in the over-scan region was subtracted from all\nthe images. Sensitivity variations were removed using observations\nof a tungsten calibration lamp.\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 334, 833\u2013839\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPG 1115+166 \u2013 a long-period DA+DB binary 835\nFigure 1. The spectrum of PG 1115+166.\nExtraction of the spectra from the images was performed auto-\nmatically using optimal extraction to maximize the signal-to-noise\nratio of the resulting spectra (Marsh 1989). The arcs associated with\neach stellar spectrum were extracted using the profile determined\nfor the stellar image to avoid possible systematic errors due to tilted\narc lines. The wavelength scale was determined from a polynomial\nfit to measured arc line positions and the wavelength of the target\nspectra interpolated from the calibration established from the brack-\neting arc spectra. Uncertainties on every data point calculated from\nphoton statistics are rigorously propagated through every stage of\nthe data reduction. The normalized spectrum of PG 1115+166 is\nshown in Fig. 1 in two sections. The spectra used to produce this\nfigure were the 1999 December WHT spectrum, the 1999 April\nWHT spectrum and the sum of the three WHT spectra from 2002\nJanuary. No attempt has been made to remove the telluric features\nnear 6900 and 7300 A\u02da.\n3 A NA LY S I S\n3.1 Radial velocities\nTo measure the radial velocities we used least-squares fitting of\na model line profile. This model line profile is the summation of\none or more Gaussian profiles with different widths and depths but\nwith a common central position which varies between spectra and is\nconvolved with a Gaussian profile of an appropriate width to model\nthe resolution of each spectrum.\nOne must be careful to allow for the asymmetry of the line due\nto pressure shifts, particularly when dealing with the wings of the\nhigher order Balmer lines (Grabowski, Halenka & Madej 1987) or\nthe He I lines (Beauchamp, Wesemael & Bergeron 1997). To account\nfor these asymmetries in the Balmer lines, we add a third- or fourth-\norder polynomial in the model line profile. We also exclude data\nfrom the fitting process which is more than 1000 km s\u22121 from the\nrest wavelength of the lines measured. This reduces both the effect\nof the pressure shift and the possibility of blending with other lines.\nThe radial velocity measurement is determined primarily by the\ncentre of the line and the fitting process is identical for all lines, so\nany remaining pressure shifts would only be seen as an offset of\na few km s\u22121 between the radial velocities measured for different\nBalmer lines. This is small compared to the typical uncertainties in\nthe measured radial velocities.\nThe pressure shifts in the much weaker He I lines are harder to\ndeal with, so we simply report the radial velocities measured using\na single Gaussian profile and a low-order polynomial for these lines\nand include a warning here that there are systematic shifts between\nthe velocities measured for different He I lines.\nWe first normalize the spectra using a polynomial fit to the con-\ntinuum either side of the line of interest. We use a least-squares fit\nto one of the spectra to determine the model line profile. A least-\nsquares fit of this profile to each spectrum in which the position of\nthe line and the polynomial coefficients are the only free parame-\nters gives the measured radial velocities in Table 2. We tried three\ndifferent initial values for the radial velocity in the least-squares\nminimization to ensure we found the optimum value of the radial\nvelocity and excluded the results for any spectra where the optimum\nvalue could not be clearly identified.\nThe uncertainties on each radial velocity measurement are\ncalculated by propagating the uncertainties on every data point in\nthe spectra right through the data reduction and analysis. There are\ninevitably systematic errors in our radial velocity measurements,\nparticularly as we are using spectra obtained with a variety of in-\nstruments. Maxted, Marsh & Moran (2000) found that these sys-\ntematic differences are no more than \u223c1 km s\u22121 for the majority of\nthe spectrographs used in this study. To allow for this, we include\nan additional uncertainty per radial velocity measurement equiva-\nlent to 1\/40 of the resolution, typically about 1 km s\u22121. This has\nbeen added in quadrature to the uncertainties given in Table 2. The\nradial velocity measurements of the Balmer lines are clearly vari-\nable. Of the He I line measurements, only the measurements of the\nHe I 6678 lines are sufficiently numerous and accurate to show any\nsign of variability. There are too few accurate radial velocity mea-\nsurements of the other He I lines for this variability to be apparent.\nTo quantify this we calculated their weighted mean radial velocity,\nwhich is the best estimate of the radial velocity assuming this quan-\ntity is constant.

This suggests that\nthe He I 6678 lines are likely to be variable, but the evidence from\nthis test is not conclusive.\n3.2 The orbital period\nWe used the 57 radial velocities measured from the Balmer lines to\nestablish the orbital period. We used least-squares to fit sine waves\nat 500 000 trial frequencies uniformly distributed over the range\nfrom 0 to 10 cycle d\u22121 and recorded the value of \u03c7 2 for each trial\nfrequency. Low values of \u03c7 2 occur for orbital periods P \u2248 31 d with\nthe lowest value of \u03c72 being 68.3 for P = 30.0873 d. The next most\nlikely orbital period is near the 1 cycle d\u22121 alias of this period,\nP = 1.0316 d, which has a \u03c72 value of 87.3.\nIn order to test the robustness of our period determination, we\nrandomly selected 50 of the radial velocity measurements and fitted\nsine waves at 100 000 trial frequencies, uniformly distributed over\nthe range from 0 to 1.2 cycle d\u22121, and recorded the value of the\nperiod at which the minimum value of \u03c72 occurs. We repeated this\nprocess 1000 times and found that in 973 trials this reduced data set\nproduced a minimum value of \u03c7 2 at an orbital period near 30.09 d.\nMost of the other trials favoured orbital periods near 1 d which, as\nwe have seen, gives a poor fit to the complete data set.\nAs an alternative test, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to\nestimate how often a binary with an orbital period of 1.0316 d will\nappear to have an orbital period near 30.09 d given radial veloc-\nity measurements with the same temporal sampling and accuracy\nas those presented here. We used a least-squares fit to our data\nto find the optimum period near 1.0316 d and the corresponding\nsemi-amplitude of a sine wave fit by least squares. We generated\n1000 synthetic data sets with the same period and semi-amplitude\nas this fit and with the same temporal sampling as our data. We\nadded noise to the synthetic data using psuedo-random normal de-\nviates multiplied by the uncertainties associated with each datum.\nFor each of these synthetic data sets we fitted sine waves at 100 000\ntrial frequencies uniformly distributed over the range from 0.01 to\n1.2 cycle d\u22121 and recorded the value of the period at which the\nminimum value of \u03c72 occurs. We also recorded the best values\nof \u03c7 2 which occur within 10 per cent of P = 1.0316 d and P =\n30.09 d. Of the 1000 trials, 983 trials resulted in a minimum value\nof \u03c72 near 1.0316 d and only 17 gave a minimum value of \u03c72 at a pe-\nriod near 30.09 d. Furthermore, in all the trials for which P \u2248 30.09\nd gave a lower value of \u03c7 2, the difference in the minimum \u03c72 value\nfor P \u2248 1.0316 d and P \u2248 30.09 d was usually only 1\u20133 and was\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 334, 833\u2013839\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPG 1115+166 \u2013 a long-period DA+DB binary 837\nTable 3.

In summary, this test suggests that there is\na less than a 1\/1000 chance of a binary with P = 1.0316 d being\nincorrectly identified as a binary with P = 30.09 d from our data\nprovided the least-squares fits of sine waves at the two periods result\nin a difference in \u03c72 of 8 or more. The difference in \u03c72 for our actual\ndata is 19, so this condition is easily satisfied in this case.\nThese simple tests suggest both that period determination is robust\nand that we can be confident that the orbital period is P \u2248 30.09 d.\n3.3 Spectroscopic orbit\nIf PG 1115+166 is genuinely a binary DA+DB white dwarf we\nexpect that the He I lines should move in anti-phase to the Balmer\nlines. We investigated this scenario using a least-squares fit of a sine\nwave of the form vi = \u03b3H + KH sin[2\u03c0(Ti \u2212 T0)\/P] to the measured\nradial velocities, vi, for all the Balmer lines and a sine wave of\nthe form vi = \u03b3HeI + KHeI sin[2\u03c0(Ti \u2212 T0)\/P] to the 23 measured\nradial velocities for the He I 6678 line. We used both data sets in a\nsimultaneous fit to all these data, an approach which has the merit\nof using all the available data to determine the parameters T0 and P.\nThe results are given in Table 3 and are shown in Fig. 2. We have\nexcluded data for the Balmer lines with uncertainties larger than\n20 km s\u22121 and data for the He I 6678 line with uncertainties larger\nthan 40 km s\u22121 from Fig. 2 for clarity. The derived value of KHeI\nis about four times greater than its uncertainty, so we can be fairly\nsure that the He I 6678 line moves in anti-phase to the Balmer lines\nFigure 2. Radial velocities measured from the Balmer lines (filled symbols)\nand the He I 6678 A\u02da line (open symbols) of PG 1115+166 as a function of\norbital phase. The sine waves fit by least-squares described in the text are\nalso shown.\nas expected for a DA+DB binary. We can certainly rule out the\npossibility that PG 1115+166 is a single DAB star, as that would\nrequire the He I lines and the Balmer lines to move in phase, which\nis clearly not the case. Also given in Table 3 are the results of a\nsimilar least-squares fit including the data for all the He I lines.\nThis reduces the uncertainty in the value of KHe I, but we prefer the\nresults of fitting only the He I 6678 line until the systematic errors\nintroduced by pressure shifts in He I lines is better understood. In\nany case, the results of the two least-squares fits are nearly identical.\nThe mass ratio implied by the parameters in Table 3 is q =\nMDA\/MDB = 0.84 \u00b1 0.21. This is consistent with the conclusion of\nBergeron & Liebert (2002), that the masses of the two stars are simi-\nlar. We also find MDA sin3 i = 0.43\u00b10.15 M\u0005, MDB sin3 i = 0.52\u00b1\n0.12 M\u0005 and a sin i = 40 \u00b1 5 R\u0005, where i is inclination of the bi-\nnary and a is the separation of the stars. The masses measured by\nBergeron & Liebert suggest that the inclination of the binary is ap-\nproximately 60\u25e6 and that the stars are separated by about 45 R\u0005.\n4 T H E F O R M AT I O N O F P G 1 1 1 5+1 6 6\nThe basic mechanism for the formation of most white dwarfs is fairly\nwell understood. They are, in general, remnants of intermediate mass\nstars (1\u20138 M\u0005) which have evolved through the asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) phase. Extreme mass loss towards the end of this\nphase exposes the core of the AGB star, which cools to form a white\ndwarf. Stars with larger initial masses are expected to form more\nmassive white dwarfs and there is some observational evidence for\nthis initial\u2013final mass relation (IFMR; Girardi et al. 2000). White\ndwarfs with masses of 0.7 M\u0005 are expected to form from stars with\ninitial masses of about 3 M\u0005.\nModels of stars on the AGB are uncertain, but the radius of a\nstar towards the end of this phase is several hundred solar radii\n(Girardi et al. 2000). This is much larger than the current separation\nof the stars so it appears that the orbit of PG 1115+166 is now\nsubstantially smaller than it was prior to the formation of the white\ndwarfs. Orbital shrinkage in long-period binaries is explained by\nthe \u2018common envelope\u2019 scenario. In this scenario, the expanding\nred giant star comes into contact with its Roche lobe and begins\nto transfer mass to its companion star. This mass transfer is highly\nunstable, so a common envelope (CE) forms around the companion\nand the core of the red giant. The drag on the companion orbiting\ninside the CE leads to extensive mass loss and dramatic shrinkage\nof the orbit (Iben & Livio 1993). We expect the orbit of a post-CE\nbinary to be circular, and have assumed this to be so in the case of\nPG 1115+166 throughout this paper. Much higher quality data than\nthat presented here would be required to verify this assumption.\nCE evolution is poorly understood, so it is useful to consider\nthe limits imposed on the CE phase by the observed properties\nof PG 1115+166. First, we note that published models for the\npopulation of white dwarf binaries do not predict any systems\nwith the combination of high mass and long period seen in PG\n1115+166. This is shown in Fig. 3 for the models of Iben, Tutukov &\nYungelson (1997), but the same applies to the models of Nelemans\net al. (2001) and Han (1998). It is primarily the combination of high\nmass and a long orbital period which is not explained by these mod-\nels. A full exploration of all the possible formation scenarios for\nPG 1115+166 is beyond the scope of this paper, not least because\nthere may have been up to three mass transfer episodes \u2013 two asso-\nciated with the red giant phase prior to the formation of each white\ndwarf and a third associated with the born-again red giant phase of\nthe DB white dwarf. These mass transfer episodes may not have\nbeen CE phases but may instead have involved stable mass transfer,\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 334, 833\u2013839\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n838 P.

The figure is taken from Saffer, Livio & Yungelson (1998)\nand shows the predicted number of observable white dwarf\u2013white dwarf\nbinaries as a function of orbital period and mass as a grey-scale images. We\nhave assumed an uncertainty of 0.05 M\u0005 in the mass for this figure.\ni.e. an Algol-like phase. In this section we simply outline the ob-\nservational constraints which can be applied to these scenarios and\napply these constraints to the simplest case of a single CE phase.\nApart from the present day masses of the white dwarfs (\u223c0.7 M\u0005)\nand their current separation (af \u2248 45 R\u0005), we also know the cooling\nages of the stars are 6 \u00d7 107 yr for the DA white dwarf and 2.2 \u00d7\n108 yr for the DB white dwarf (Bergeron & Liebert 2002). The cool-\ning ages are the time elapsed since the AGB phase. If the progenitors\nof the white dwarfs were formed at the same time, this imposes a\nlimit on the initial masses of the progenitor stars as follows. If we\nassume an initial mass for the progenitor of the DB star, M \u20321, we\ncan use an appropriate stellar model to find the lifetime of this star,\n\u03c41, i.e. the time taken since it formed for the star to reach the end\nof AGB phase. We then know that the progenitor of the DA star\nwill take a further 2.2 \u00d7 108\u20136 \u00d7 107 = 1.6 \u00d7 108 yr to reach the\nAGB phase. We can then use grid of stellar models to find the ini-\ntial mass, M \u20322, of a star whose lifetime is \u03c42 = \u03c41 + 1.6 \u00d7 108 y, i.e.\nthe mass of the progenitor of the DA star. The relationship between\nthese initial masses is shown in Fig. 4 based on the models of Girardi\nFigure 4. The relationship between the initial masses of the progenitors of\nthe DB star (M \u20321 ) and the DA star (M \u20322 ) implied by the difference in cooling\nages of (1.6 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 108 y based on the models of Girardi et al. (2000) for\nZ = 0.019 (solid lines) and Z = 0.004 (dashed lines).\net al. (2000) for Z = 0.019 (solid lines) and Z = 0.004 (dashedlines).\nAlthough the stars have not evolved as single stars, this argument\nregarding the cooling-age difference between the stars remains valid\nbecause the AGB phase is much shorter than the lifetime of the star\nwhich precedes it, i.e. the stars spend most of their lives evolving as\nsingle stars. However, we should be aware that the IFMR may not\napply to the white dwarfs in PG 1115+166 in the sense that a star\nmay produce a white dwarf which is less massive than expected if it\nis involved in a CE phase which interrupts the growth of the future\nwhite dwarf forming in its core. Also, this constraint may not be\nvalid if there has been significant accretion on to one of the stars.\nSimilarly, if the born-again red giant phase of the DB star was short,\nthe DB white dwarf may not have been re-heated to the temperatures\nexpected for a white dwarf emerging from its first AGB phase. In\nthis case the cooling age does not measure either the time since the\nAGB phase, nor the time since the born-again red giant phase, but\nis somewhere between these two time-scales.\nThe observation that one of the stars is a DB white dwarf is also a\nconstraint on possible formation scenarios for PG 1115+166. Any\nfeasible scenario must allow for the DB white dwarf to undergo\na born-again red giant phase or include an alternative explanation\nfor how this star came to be hydrogen-deficient. A stronger con-\nstraint, perhaps, is how this star avoids accreting hydrogen on to it\nsurface despite appearing to be older than its companion which has,\npresumably, lost large quantities of hydrogen rich material.\nWith this information we consider the simplest case of a single\nCE phase in which the AGB star progenitor of the DA star with\nmass M2 and radius R2 interacts with the DB star when it is close\nto or exceeds its Roche lobe. Note that M2 will be less than M \u20322 if\nany mass loss occurs prior to the interaction. However, this mass\nloss cannot have been very extensive in this scenario because the\nDB white dwarf cannot have gained more than \u000210\u221214 M\u0005, so we\nassume M2 = M \u20322. If the initial semi-major axis of the orbit of the\nstars is ai and the current separation is af, the change in the orbital\nbinding energy is\n\u000eEorb = G M2 MDB2ai \u2212\nG MDA MDB\n2af\nSome fraction of this energy \u03b1CE is used to expel the envelope of\nthe AGB star whose binding energy is given by\nEenv = \u2212 G M2(M2 \u2212 MDA)\n\u03bbR1\n.\nTherefore, from the definition of \u03b1CE we have\n\u03b1CE\u03bb\n(\nG MDA MDB\n2af\n\u2212 G M2 MDB\n2ai\n)\n= G M2(M2 \u2212 MDA)\nR1\n.\nIf the orbit prior to the interaction has an eccentricity e, then the\nR1 = rLai(1 \u2212 e) at the time of interaction, where rL is the radius\nof the Roche lobe relative to the separation of the stars. This assumes\nthat the interaction occurs at periastron, which is reasonable given\nthat the orbital period (\u223c10 y) is much shorter than the evolutionary\ntimescale of an AGB star.\nIn Fig. 5 we show lines of constant \u03b1CE\u03bb as a function of M2 and\nR2\/(1 \u2212 e) for MDA = MDB = 0.7 M\u0005 and af = 45 R\u0005.

The efficiency of the common envelope phase, \u03b1CE\u03bb, as a function\nof the radius, R2 and the mass M2 of the AGB star progenitor of the DA\nwhite dwarf in PG 1115+166. Solid lines correspond to values of \u03b1CE\u03bb as\nmarked. The effect of a change of 0.02 M\u0005 in the current masses of the\nwhite dwarfs is illustrated by the dotted lines either side of the solid lines.\n(\u22482 M\u0005), we see that \u03b1CE\u03bb\u0001 1.0. This requires a large value of \u03bb\nbecause \u03b1CE < 1 in the absence of other sources of energy to eject\nthe envelope. This strong limit on \u03bb is a consequence of the com-\nbination of a long orbital period and high mass in PG 1115+166.\nLarge values of \u03bb for AGB stars are predicted by Dewi & Tauris\n(2000) provided the calculation of the binding energy of the en-\nvelope includes the internal energy stored in the envelope, e.g. as\nionized hydrogen. This implicitly assumes that this potential energy\nis efficiently converted into the kinetic energy of the envelope during\nthe common envelope phase. Several issues arising from this sce-\nnario remain to be explored, e.g. how does the DB star avoid gaining\nmore than 10\u221214 M\u0005 of hydrogen during the CE phase, why was\nthere no CE phase when the progenitor of the DB star went through\nits AGB phase and where does the born-again red giant phase fit\ninto this scenario? It is beyond the scope of this paper to tackle\nthese questions, but they do demonstrate that our observations of\nPG 1115+166 provide a challenging test of models for binary star\nevolution and the formation of DB white dwarfs.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N\nWe have used radial velocity measurements of the Balmer lines\nand He I lines of PG 1115+166 to show that this star is a DA+DB\nbinary white dwarf with an orbital period of 30.09 d. Published mod-\nels for the formation of white dwarf\u2013white dwarf binaries do not pre-\ndict any white dwarfs with the characteristics of PG 1115+166. We\nconsider the observational constraints on scenarios for the formation\nof PG 1115+166. We apply these to the simplest case of a single\ncommon-envelope phase. We find that this requires that some part\nof the internal energy in the envelope of the AGB star contributes\nto the ejection of the common envelope, but several questions re-\ngarding this scenario remain to be answered. We conclude that\nPG 1115+166 is a key object for testing models of binary star\nevolution. It may also be a key object for our understanding of the\nformation of DB white dwarfs.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nPFLM would like to thank Jacco van Loon for his helpful dis-\ncussions regarding AGB stars and Phillip Podsiadlowski for shar-\ning his thoughts on the formation of PG 1115+166.
