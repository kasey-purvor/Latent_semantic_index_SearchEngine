It had arisen out of keynote and theme speaker presentations at two key e-learn-\ning conferences last year: ALT-C 2004 \u2018Blue Skies and Pragmatism\u2014learning\ntechnologies for the next decade\u2019, which was held in Exeter; and the Colston Sympo-\nsium entitled \u2018The Evolution of Learning and Web Technologies: survival of the\nfittest?\u2019, which was held in Bristol.\nIt is interesting that, despite the different focus of each of the papers in this issue,\nthere are a number of common themes that cut across them, which are useful indica-\ntors of current thinking in this area and encouragingly suggesting that our area of\nresearch is starting to mature.\nThe papers reflect on some of the key issues involved in current e-learning research\nand development: quality assurance, repurposing of learning objects, researching\nperceptions about e-learning and associated methodological issues, open courseware\ninitiatives and mechanisms for implementing strategic change.\nRon Oliver, from Edith Cowan University, Australia, starts the issue off with an\ninsightful and reflective piece on the role of quality assurance in e-learning. He\naddresses the question: \u2018What are the necessary conditions for e-learning and can\nthese conditions guarantee that e-learning will be successful?\u2019\nCathy Gunn and colleagues from Auckland University outline what they describe\nas a \u2018sustainable and participative approach to reuse that involves repurposing learn-\ning objects for different discipline areas\u2019. In particular, they argue that \u2018teachers need\nto develop new and contextually appropriate instructional strategies for learner-\ncentric design models\u2019. This is a viewpoint that has gained wide-scale acceptance in\nrecent years, and which interestingly also aligns well with current directions and\nthinking in underpinning learning theories\u2014with a shift from individualistically\nfocused approaches to learning to those based on constructivist and socially situated\napproaches.\nIn Gilly Salmons\u2019 paper the focus is on institutional wide implementation, and in\nparticular the development of appropriate strategic frameworks to support this. She\nreflects on the current status of e-learning, using the metaphor of flight\u2014suggesting\nthat in terms of e-learning, \u2018the introduction of ICT into the world of learning and\nteaching in universities is now in transition from \u201cflapping\u201d to mass take off\u2019. She goes\non to describe the approach adopted at Leicester University, which consists of a four-\n172 G. Conole\nquadrant framework that takes account of integration of both mainstream and\nperipheral technologies. It will be interesting in due course to see a follow-up paper\non the effectiveness of this approach as all institutions are struggling with addressing\nthis central issue and ways to implement e-learning effectively, strategically and on a\nwider scale.\nThe fourth paper by de Vries et al., from The Netherlands, follows on from Rob\nKoper\u2019s themed presentation at ALT-C 2004. It represents a detailed empirical study\nthat attempts to identify the critical factors associated with providing support for\nstudents in an e-learning environment. They used a Nominal Group Technique to\ngather the data and categorised these factors into content-related, process-related and\nproduct-related support activities. This also raises interesting methodological issues\nabout the ways in which we categorise and code data and the meaning we can subse-\nquently derive from these approaches.\nThe final two articles are discussion pieces, which provide a snapshot of current e-\nlearning developments and reflection on future directions. Sarah Porter, from the Joint\nInformation Systems Committee, reflects on the papers presented at ALT-C 2004 that\nwere under the technical infrastructure and new technology strands of the conference.\nShe states that \u2018there is a highly complex set of relationships between \u201cinnovative\u201d,\n\u201crisky\u201d or \u201cblue skies\u201d technology and its effective use in supporting practitioners or\n\u201cpragmatism\u201d\u2019, and goes on to pose a series of questions: What should be the rela-\ntionship between technology and practice? Should technology stimulate innovation in\npractice or should technology support practice? Or is it able to do both? At what point\nshould innovation become \u2018embedded\u2019 into practice and how can this be achieved? The\ndiscussion piece then reflects on the extent to which these questions were addressed in\nthe papers at the conference. Vijay Kumar\u2019s discussion piece is based on his keynote\npresentation at ALT-C 2004. His papers describes the background to the much publi-\ncised MIT Open Courseware initiative and highlights some of the educational oppor-\ntunity presented by MIT\u2019s current IT-enabled educational agenda and related\ninitiatives, along with their strategic underpinnings and implications. It examines how\nthese ambitious programmes achieve a vision characterised by an abundance of sustain-\nable, transformative educational opportunities, not merely pervasive technology.\nReading through the six articles I was struck by how they demonstrate the way in\nwhich e-learning research and development has begun to mature, and in particular\nhow, despite focusing on different specific aspects of research, a number of common\nthemes emerge. For example, the role of learning objects and the purpose of reuse\ncuts across a number of the papers (Oliver, Gunn and Porter, for example), and effec-\ntive strategic frameworks is clearly a focus for Oliver, Salmon and Kumar. The move\ntowards more of a component-based approach to development is evidently present in\nboth Porter and Kumar\u2019s papers. I hope, like me, you will enjoy reading these papers\nand find them stimulating in terms of providing an understanding of current e-learn-\ning research developments and reflection on what these mean in terms of future direc-\ntions for our area.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nUniversity of Southampton, UK\n"}
