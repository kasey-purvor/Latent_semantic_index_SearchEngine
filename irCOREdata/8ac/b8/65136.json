The current generation of continental-scale ice-sheet models cannot successfully reproduce\nthe complex ice\/water\/sediment interactions of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) in a physically\nmeaningful manner. The potential of a thin-film-based subglacial water-flowmodel for incorporation into\na continental-scale coupled ice\/water flow model of the WAIS is evaluated in this paper. The subglacial\nwater-flow model is applied to the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS, in both a steady-state and time-\ndependent form, to derive the equilibrium water depth for the present-day configuration. The potential\nfor coupling the model to an ice-flowmodel is then demonstrated, using a variable sliding parameter that\nis a function of the subglacial water depth. A coupled ice\/water flow model, using the parameterization\ntested in this paper, could have the potential for reproducing the surface elevation, velocity and thermal\nregime of the WAIS successfully. These requirements are crucial in modelling the evolution of the WAIS,\nand must be addressed before reliable continental-scale predictive models can be utilized.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe marine-based West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) is drained\nby fast-flowing ice streams with low surface gradients and\nlow basal shear stresses. Their fast flow is facilitated by the\ndeformation of water-saturated subglacial sediments (Alley\nand others, 1986; Tulaczyk and others, 2000a), despite net\nfreeze-on of subglacial water occurring beneath large areas\nof the ice-stream trunks (Joughin and others, 2004). Models\nthat address basal processes exist at a local scale (e.g.\nTulaczyk and others, 2000b; Bougamont and others, 2003;\nParizek and Alley, 2004); however, a valid continental-scale\nmodel for the WAIS has not yet been developed (Le Brocq,\n2007). It is possible to reproduce the low surface slopes of the\nice streams by incorporating a measure of effective pressure\n(e.g. ice thickness above buoyancy) into the sliding relation,\nalong with the basal shear stress (e.g. Budd and others, 1984).\nHowever, in order to restrict the streaming flow to the ice\nstreams, a thermal criterion has often been introduced, such\nthat sliding occurs only where the base of the ice is at the\npressure-melting point (e.g. Payne, 1999; Le Brocq, 2007).\nThis is contrary to modelled basal melt rates derived from\ndata assimilation (Joughin and others, 2004), suggesting that\nthe majority of the interior of the WAIS is at the pressure-\nmelting point. Further, Joughin and others (2004) suggest that\nfreeze-on can occur beneath ice streams; in order for ice\nstreams to remain at the pressure-melting point in regions of\nbasal freeze-on, there must be a supply of subglacial water to\nprevent the ice falling below the melting point. The role of\nsubglacial water is not represented in the model formulation\ndescribed above. The existence of fast ice-stream flow in\nareas of net freeze-on suggests either a cyclical (melt\/freeze\u2013\nslip\/stick) behaviour of ice streams (Tulaczyk and others\n2000a), or that the redistribution of water plays a role in\nmaintaining fast ice-stream flow despite the net basal freeze-\non (Parizek and others, 2003). The regulatory role of the\nthermal and subglacial hydrological regime is crucial to the\nevolution of the ice sheet, and must be represented in a\nphysically meaningful manner in an ice-sheet flow model.\nThe role of subglacial water in controlling ice dynamics is\nfurther underlined by the current discussion of the role of\nsubglacial lakes in supplying periodic large volumes of water\ndirectly to fast-flow drainage features (e.g. Wingham and\nothers, 2006; Fricker and others, 2007; Stearns and others,\n2008), and the existence of subglacial lakes at fast-flow onset\nzones (e.g. Siegert and Bamber, 2000; Bell and others 2007).\nThe role of subglacial water in regulating ice flow has a\nlong research history in both alpine and ice-sheet environ-\nments (see next section). However, converting this research\ninto an appropriate model of subglacial water flow for\ncoupling with an ice-flow model for an ice sheet is still at an\nearly stage of development. The large majority of previous\nattempts propose the use of, or are based on, a Weertman-\ntype water \u2018film\u2019 as a parameterization of the subglacial water\nsystem (Weertman, 1966, 1972; Weertman and Birchfield,\n1982; Budd and Jenssen, 1987; Alley, 1989, 1996; Johnson\nand Fastook, 2002). Arnold and Sharp (2002) introduce a\nrepresentation of subglacial channels into their model,\nalthough, at a model resolution of 40 km, this is more a\nparameterization of the nature of the subglacial hydrological\nsystem than a physically based representation of the channels\nthemselves. In the above models, the sliding velocity of the\nice is proposed to be a function of the subglacial water depth\n(except for Arnold and Sharp (2002), where the sliding is a\nfunction of water pressure). The strength of this type of\nparameterization is that it is conceptually simple, relatively\ninexpensive computationally, and applicable in coarse-\nresolution modelling. It is clear from the review, presented\nbelow, and the subsequent model description, however, that\nthe model applied in this paper is a simple parameterization\nof a complex system, and contains a number of assumptions\nrelating to the nature of the subglacial water flow.\nNone of the above models have been validated against\nmeasured data, so it is only possible to investigate the\nimpact that the subglacial water has on the model output.\nSince this previous research, a large amount of data, against\nwhich to evaluate such a model, has become available for\nJournal of Glaciology, Vol. 55, No. 193, 2009 879\nthe WAIS. These datasets include ice velocity (Joughin and\nothers, 2002), basal melt rates (from data inversion) (Joughin\nand others, 2004) and accurate surface topography (Bamber\nand others, 2009). The aim of this paper is to revisit the thin-\nfilm-based model of subglacial hydrology and to evaluate\nthe potential of the model for improving ice-flow model\nsimulations of the WAIS in particular, using the newly\navailable data.\nA brief review of previous research into subglacial water\nsystems is provided in the next section, and a description of\nthe model applied in this work given. The subglacial water-\nflow model is then applied to the present-day configuration\nof the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS (Fig. 1) to derive the\nequilibrium water depth. The model utilizes two schemes \u2013\na time-dependent scheme and a steady-state scheme \u2013 and\ntwo resolutions \u2013 20 km and 5 km. The potential for coupling\nthe subglacial water-flow model with an ice-sheet model is\nthen outlined and discussed.\nBACKGROUND\nThere are many possible mechanisms for water transport\nbeneath an ice sheet. Four different methods of water flow\nbeneath glaciers were proposed around the early 1970s:\n(1) R channels, incised into the ice (Ro\u00a8thlisberger, 1972);\n(2) N channels, incised into the bedrock (Nye, 1973); (3) in a\nwater film, mm in depth (Weertman, 1966, 1972); and (4) in\na linked cavity system (Lliboutry, 1968). These first theories\nof subglacial water flow were concerned with the flow\nbetween the ice and the bedrock; flow in the underlying\nsubstrate was not initially considered. Walder and Fowler\n(1994) proposed that a distributed system of broad canals\nmay form in the sediment. There is also the possibility of\naquifer flow in the sediment, though it is usually not\nconsidered to have the capacity required to transport\nsignificant amounts of meltwater (Lingle and Brown,\n1987). The important distinction between these mechanisms\nconcerns those that are channelized and those that are\ndistributed. In a distributed system, the effective pressure is\nlow (the water pressure approaches the ice overburden\npressure) and the effective pressure decreases with in-\ncreasing discharge. In a channelized system, the effective\npressure is high, and increases with increasing discharge.\nA link between the subglacial water and the sliding\nvelocity of an ice sheet was acknowledged by Weertman\n(1964), observing that a water layer with a thickness an order\nof magnitude smaller than the controlling obstacle size can\ncause an appreciable increase in the sliding velocity.\nFig. 1. Location map showing the Ross Sea ice streams. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) velocity (from Joughin and others,\n2002) overlaid on a hillshade of the surface digital elevation model (Bamber and others, 2009). Velocity contours shown are 25 ma\u20131 (thin\nline) and 250 ma\u20131 (thick line); coastline is from Antarctic Digital Database version 3, and the dashed line marks the margin of the formerly\nfast-flowing Kamb Ice Stream.\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica880\nWeertman\u2019s initial theory was extended by Lliboutry (e.g.\nLliboutry, 1968), who pointed out that water-filled cavity\nformation on the downstream side of protuberances would\naffect the sliding velocity through the decoupling of the ice\nand the bed. Weertman (1964) proposed a modified relation\nfor the sliding velocity, incorporating the effect of the water\nlayer into the roughness estimation. Weertman and Birch-\nfield (1982) applied the model in a theoretical framework, to\ninfer the impact of a water layer on WAIS stability. Budd and\nJenssen (1987) extended this work by calculating the\nequilibrium water depth for the Ross Sea sector of the\nWAIS. Using a temperature model and balance-velocity\nestimations (assuming steady-state conditions), they calcu-\nlated basal temperatures and melt rates for the Ross Sea\nsector. The resulting water depths reach 10mm under the ice\nstreams, but are much less under the rest of the ice sheet.\nBudd and Jenssen (1987) correlated the water depth,\nbalance velocity and basal shear stress for the Ross Sea\nsector, and suggest that the basal traction parameter in the\nice-flow model could be made a simple function of the\nwater-film thickness.\nSince the work of Budd and Jenssen (1987), under-\nstanding of the role of subglacial water in the WAIS has\ndeveloped, with deformation of water-saturated subglacial\nsediments identified in facilitating fast flow in the Ross Sea\nsector (Alley and others, 1986; Tulaczyk and others, 2000a).\nTulaczyk and others (2000a) demonstrated that the yield\nstrength of the sediment was a function of the water content\nof the sediment; the higher the water content of the sediment\nwas, the lower the yield strength and, hence, the faster the\nice sliding velocity (here the term \u2018sliding velocity\u2019 in-\ncorporates all types of basal ice motion, including sliding\nover the substrate and via deformation of the substrate). This\nmeans that for parts of the WAIS, it is the water in the\nunderlying substrate that is important in regulating sliding\nvelocity, rather than the water between the underlying\nsubstrate and the ice. The controlling factor in the sliding\nvelocity is still the water availability (rather than the water\npressure), so the water depth from the water-film model\ncould be a useful proxy for the subglacial water content of\nthe sediments beneath parts of the WAIS. The work\npresented here revisits that of Budd and Jenssen (1987),\nwith the benefit of more and better-quality data and an\nimproved perspective on the requirements of a subglacial\nwater-flow model for coupling with an ice-flow model.\nMODEL DESCRIPTION\nThe model applied here is the most simplistic form of the\n\u2018Weertman\u2019 water-film model (following Budd and Jenssen\n(1987) and the suggestions of Alley (1996)). The subglacial\nwater-flow model assumes that water flows in a thin film of\nwater, of the order of mm thickness. The evolution of the\nwater-film depth (d) is given by\n@d\n@t\n\u00bc M \u0002r:uwd , \u00f01\u00de\nwhere t is time, M is the basal melt rate (negative values\nindicate basal freeze-on) and uw is the depth-averaged\nwater velocity vector (bold indicates two-dimensional\nhorizontal vector), calculated using a theoretical treatment\nof laminar flow between two parallel plates, driven by\ndifferences in the water pressure (see, e.g., the appendix of\nWeertman, 1966):\nuw \u00bc d\n2\n12\u0002\nr\u0002, \u00f02\u00de\nwhere \u0002 is the viscosity of water and \u0002 is the hydraulic\npotential. The hydraulic potential is a function of the\nelevation potential and the water pressure, and is calculated\nusing\n\u0002 \u00bc \u0003wgh \u00fe pw, \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u0003w is the density of water, g is the acceleration due to\ngravity, h is the bedrock elevation and pw is the water\npressure. The water pressure, pw, is a function of the ice\noverburden pressure and the effective pressure:\npw \u00bc \u0003igH \u0002N, \u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u0003i is the density of ice, H is the ice thickness and N is\neffective pressure. In a channelized system, the water\npressure will be less than the ice overburden pressure, so N\nwill be non-zero. In a distributed system, however, the\nwater pressure will be close to, if not at, the overburden\npressure. As a result, a simplification can be made to\nEquation (4), assuming N to be zero (see, e.g., Budd and\nJenssen, 1987; Alley, 1996).\nThe assumption that N is zero simplifies the calculation of\nthe hydraulic potential surface by removing the need to\ncalculate the water pressure. With this simplification,\ncombining and rearranging Equations (3) and (4) (rewriting\nin terms of the upper and lower ice-surface elevations) gives\nthe gradient of the potential surface as\nr \u00bc \u0003igrs \u00fe \u0003w \u0002 \u0003i\u00f0 \u00degrh, \u00f05\u00de\nwhere s is the ice surface elevation. Equation (4) demon-\nstrates the well-known result that the potential gradient is\nmainly governed by the ice surface gradient; it is\n\u000310 times more important than the bedrock gradient (as\n\u0003i = 0.91\u0004103 kgm\u20133 and (\u0003w \u2013 \u0003i) = 0.09\u0004103 kgm\u20133). Ice\nstreams generally occupy bedrock troughs, and have a\nrelatively low surface elevation (due to drawdown from fast\nflow), so their hydraulic potential will be lower than beneath\nthe adjacent areas. As a result, meltwater generated at the\nbase of the ice in the WAIS will be directed to the beds of the\nice streams (Weertman and Birchfield, 1982).\nTime-dependent vs steady-state approach\nEquation (1) can be solved in two ways, either using a time-\ndependent approach, where @d\/@t is calculated and solved\nusing a numerical technique, or a steady-state approach,\nwhich assumes that @d\/@t=0. In a coupled ice\/water flow\nmodel, the steady-state approach leads to the assumption\nthat the water system reaches equilibrium within the\ntimescale of ice response; hence, only a steady-state\n\u2018snapshot\u2019 of the subglacial water system is required. This\nhas the benefit of reducing computational expense, though it\nwill reduce the level of interaction of the ice and subglacial\nwater systems. The following discussion presents evidence\nsuggesting that the steady-state approach is a reasonable\nassumption given the difference in the timescales over\nwhich ice and water flow.\nWAIS ice velocities range from <1 to around 1500ma\u20131\n(e.g. Whillans and others, 1987; Joughin and others, 2002).\nA direct measurement of subglacial water velocity was made\nusing a salt tracing experiment at a location on Whillans Ice\nStream (Engelhardt and Kamb, 1997). A salt solution was\nreleased from the base of a borehole, and the electrical\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica 881\nresistance between electrodes in two downstream boreholes\nwas measured. A sharp decrease in the electrical resistance\nbetween the boreholes was observed 2.4 hours after release,\ngiving an average propagation velocity of 7.5\u000410\u20133m s\u20131\n(\u0003200\u0004103ma\u20131; Engelhardt and Kamb, 1997). Wingham\nand others (2006) calculate the velocity of water in a\nsubglacial tunnel during a lake drainage event (inferred from\nisolated surface elevation changes) to be 0.1\u20132.1m s\u20131.\nAlthough this is an extreme example due to the high volume\nof water transferred (and flow in a tunnel will not be\ngoverned by the laminar flow assumption in the water film),\nit illustrates the potential difference in the flow timescales of\nice and water. Taking the longest travel path in the WAIS for\ninterior subglacial melt as \u0003700 km, and assuming a water\nvelocity of \u00031\u0004 10\u20132m s\u20131, the interior melt would take\n\u00032 years to reach the grounding line. This implies that the\ntimescale of response to a perturbation in the subglacial\nwater system is relatively short. The response time of an ice\nmass to a perturbation will be much longer, of the order of\ndecades (e.g. Payne and others, 2004).\nBoth a steady-state and time-dependent approach to\nsolving for the subglacial water depth will be demonstrated\nhere. As only the present-day equilibrium subglacial water\ndistribution is calculated here, the results will indicate\nwhether the numerical scheme has an impact on the\nresulting subglacial water distribution.\nTime-dependent approach\nIn order to solve Equation (1) for the evolution of the water\ndepth (d) over time (time-dependent approach), a numerical\nscheme is required. Initially a Lax\u2013Wendroff scheme was\ntested; however, in one-dimensional testing, this proved to\nbe numerically unstable except at very small time-steps due\nto the often steep gradients in the potential surface and,\nhence, the water depth. Instead, a first-order upwind scheme\nwas tried and proved to be stable at much larger time-steps,\ndue to the implicit diffusion introduced by the scheme\n(Press, 2007). The hydraulic potential surface may have sinks\nor hollows occurring in it; if these sinks are left unaltered,\ninfinite water depths will build up in these locations. The\nsinks may indicate the presence of subglacial lakes, areas of\nbasal freezing, or may be due to the resampling of the data\nto a coarse resolution, or simply errors in the topography\ndatasets. In order to make a complete hydrological connec-\ntion to the grounding line, these sinks are artificially filled\nusing a filling algorithm. The filling algorithm assigns the\naverage of the four immediate neighbours to the sink\ngridcell, repeating the process until a complete hydrological\nconnection between upstream and downstream coastal\nareas can be achieved (see, e.g., Budd and Warner, 1996).\nSteady-state approach\nTaking @d\/@t=0 in Equation (1) (steady-state approach), it is\npossible to use a flux balance approach to calculate the\nsteady-state water depth (in a similar way to balance-\nvelocity calculations; see, e.g., Budd and Warner (1996) or\nLe Brocq and others (2006), for more details).\nConsidering a grid-based balance approach, the balance\nflux equation for each cell is\n out \u00bc  in \u00feMr2, \u00f06\u00de\nwhere  out is the total flux out of the cell (m3 a\u20131),  in is the\nflux into the cell, and r is the cell edge length (assuming a\nsquare cell). In other words, the balance approach requires\nthat the outgoing water flux from an area is equal to the\nincoming flux plus the melt rate in the area.\nTaking the outgoing flux as an approximation for the flux\nthrough a cell, the balance equation can be stated in terms\nof the water depth and velocity\n out \u00bc uwj jdl, \u00f07\u00de\nwhere l is the unit width, dependent on the flow direction\nthrough the gridcell. The flow direction relative to the grid\norientation (\u0004) is calculated by fitting a plane to the\nelevations of the four neighbouring cells, and l is then\ncalculated using\nl \u00bc r cos \u0004j j \u00fe sin \u0004j j\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f08\u00de\nThe incoming flux to each gridcell,  in, can be calculated\nusing an upstream flow-routing algorithm (Budd and\nWarner, 1996; Le Brocq and others, 2006), and corrected\nfor the unit width, l; hence, Equation (7) can be written as\n in \u00feMr2\nl\n\u00bc uwj jd : \u00f09\u00de\nThe flux through the cell now has units of m2 a\u20131 per unit\nwidth. Combining Equations (2) and (9) and rearranging for\nd gives\nd \u00bc 12\u0002Qlr\u0002j j\n\u0002 \u00031\n3\n, \u00f010\u00de\nwhere Ql represents the upstream flux from the left-hand\nterm in Equation (9).\nThe calculation of the upstream flux is independent of the\nwater-flow model dynamics; the resulting flux distribution is\ndriven solely by the direction potential gradient. The flow-\nrouting algorithm used in this paper follows that of Budd and\nWarner (1996). Le Brocq and others (2006) demonstrated\nthat this algorithm suffers from dependency on the grid size\nand orientation, so it will be useful to compare the resulting\nsubglacial water distribution with that derived from the time-\ndependent numerical scheme.\nMODEL SET-UP\nThe model is applied to the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS, as it\nis this location that has basal melt rates available from data\nassimilation (Joughin and others, 2004). The subglacial\nwater-flow model requires three datasets: the ice surface\ntopography, ice thickness (or basal topography) and basal\nmelt rates. Present-day basal topography is derived from the\nBEDMAP project (Lythe and others, 2001), and the surface\ntopography is derived from a digital elevation model (DEM)\nusing combined radar\/laser altimetry (Bamber and others,\n2009). Previously derived melt rates for the Ross Sea ice\nstreams (Joughin and others, 2004) were used as the basal\nmelt input. The datasets were resampled to 5 km and 20 km\nwhere necessary, using the average value of the subgrid\ncells.\nApplication to the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS\n20 km resolution\nThe hydraulic potential surface calculated for the Ross Sea\nsector has a number of sinks (marked in Fig. 2a). These range\nfrom small equivalent water depths of 0.4m to larger depths\nof 13.8m. The time-dependent model was applied first; the\noverall subglacial water pattern is established after \u00032 years\n(Fig. 2b). The equilibrium modelled water depth ranges from\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica882\n0.1mm under the sheet to 15mm under ice streams.\nOverall, the modelled subglacial water-depth distribution\nshows a good correlation with the measured ice velocity\n(contours marked in Fig. 2b). The water velocity at Engel-\nhardt and Kamb\u2019s (1997) measurement site (see above) is\nmodelled to be 5.6\u000410\u20132m s\u20131 (water depth is 11mm), an\norder of magnitude higher than that measured by Engelhardt\nand Kamb (1997).\nThe water-depth distribution around the diversion\/stagna-\ntion region of Kamb Ice Stream (Anandakrishnan and Alley,\n1997; Price and others, 2001; see Fig. 2b) is quite\nincoherent. There is a definite diversion of water from the\nexpected catchment of Kamb Ice Stream towards Whillans\nIce Stream (see also Fig. 2c), but the model predicts that\nenough water still flows under the formerly streaming part of\nKamb Ice Stream to buffer the basal freeze-on (i.e. water is\npredicted beneath Kamb Ice Stream; cf. Vogel and others,\n2005). Table 1 shows a comparison of water budgets for the\nice-stream catchments as delineated (based on ice-surface\nrouting) by Joughin and others (2004), with the budgets\nderived here by routing the water down the hydraulic\npotential surface. The results indicate that Whillans Ice\nStream is capturing some melt that would be expected by\nJoughin and others (2004) to be derived from Kamb Ice\nStream\u2019s catchment (0.21 km3 a\u20131; Table 1).\nThe total basal melt computed by Budd and Jenssen\n(1987) for the region is similar to that calculated by Joughin\nand others (2004) (for the same geothermal heat-flux value),\nat about 1.85 km3 a\u20131 (compared to 2.0 km3 a\u20131). However,\nthere are some key differences between the melt distribution\nused in the Budd and Jenssen experiments and the\ndistribution used here. Budd and Jenssen (1987) calculate\nonly basal melt, rather than melt and freeze-on rates, and\nuse a melt distribution generated from a lower geothermal\nFig. 2. Ross Sea ice streams: (a) hydraulic potential surface, 20 km resolution (sinks marked with triangles); (b) modelled subglacial water\ndepth, 20 km resolution (time-dependent approach); (c) modelled subglacial water flux (per unit width), 20 km resolution (time-dependent\napproach); and (d) modelled subglacial water depth, 20 km resolution (steady-state approach).\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica 883\nheat flux in their water-flow experiments. Further, the\ndistribution of the melt differs; the total area of the melt\nregion calculated by Joughin and others (2004) is much\ngreater than calculated by Budd and Jenssen (1987). Melt\noccurs beneath the majority of the region in the Joughin and\nothers (2004) calculation, compared to a region limited to\nthe ice-stream tributaries and trunks in the Budd and Jenssen\n(1987) calculations. As a result of these differences in the\ntwo melt distributions, the water-flux and -depth distribu-\ntions differ between the two studies, with high water fluxes\n(>104 km2 a\u20131) and high water depths (>10mm) occurring\nmore extensively in the ice-sheet interior in the results\npresented here. Despite these differences in flux and depth\nvalues between the studies, it is possible to identify that the\nmore recent configuration datasets lead to a higher level of\ndetail in the water-depth distribution presented here, with\ndistinct tributaries identifiable, which are not apparent in the\nBudd and Jenssen (1987) distributions.\nThe steady-state model was then applied to the Ross Sea\nsector. The predicted subglacial water distribution from the\nsteady-state approach is largely similar to that from the\ntime-dependent approach (Fig. 2d). One noticeable differ-\nence, however, is the tendency for more-focused flow, with\nwater, in effect, being channelled into features sometimes\nonly one cell wide. This channelling effect was noted by Le\nBrocq and others (2006) when considering grid-based ice-\nbalance flux distributions. The water depths are, over the\nwhole domain, lower using the steady-state solution; an\nartefact of the approximate conversion from a volume flux\nto a flux per unit width.\n5 km resolution\nThe time-dependent scheme was applied to the 5 km\nresolution Ross Sea datasets (Fig. 3a). At a gridscale of\n5 km, the ice surface and bed morphology are such that\ndistinct concentrations of flow occur at the gridscale. The\nassumption that the effective pressure is zero may con-\ntribute to the presence of the flow concentrations; at finer\ngrid resolutions, differences in water pressure and over-\nburden pressure may become more significant. Alley (1996)\nassumes that the effective pressure is inversely related to\nthe water depth; hence, where water depths are relatively\nhigh, the effective pressure will be lower (hence, water\npressure will be higher). This will serve to modify the\npotential surface (see Equations (3) and (4)), raising the\npotential surface in areas of large water depths, which\ncould help to make the gradients in the potential surface\nsmaller. It is therefore uncertain whether the flow concen-\ntrations would exist in reality; however, their presence does\nnot affect the regional patterns of drainage that we are\nprimarily interested in. There are also some areas that do\nnot have such concentrated flow features (e.g. tributaries\nbetween Bindschadler and MacAyeal Ice Streams). Most of\nthe melt from the Kamb Ice Stream catchment is drained\nbeneath Kamb Ice Stream in this experiment (\u000370%).\nHowever, it only takes a surface change of 5\u201310m in two\ncells to divert all the water under Whillans Ice Stream,\nTable 1.

A statistical approach is demonstrated,\nin which the correlation between the subglacial water depth\nand basal traction parameter is investigated. An example\nsliding relation is chosen to demonstrate the approach\nproposed in this paper.\nA number of continental-scale ice-flow models use\nsliding relations that are a function solely of the basal shear\nstress (e.g. Hulbe and MacAyeal, 1999; Payne, 1999). In\nthese models, the basal shear stress is approximated by the\ngravitational driving stress; longitudinal stresses are not\nconsidered (at a coarse resolution (>\u000320 km) the longi-\ntudinal stresses can largely be neglected (Kamb and Echel-\nmeyer, 1986)). Payne (1999), for example, uses a relation of\nthe form\nuh \u00bc B\u0005 , \u00f011\u00de\nwhere uh is the sliding velocity, B is the basal traction\nparameter and \u0005 is the basal shear stress given by\n\u0005 \u00bc \u0002\u0003igHrs: \u00f012\u00de\nAs mentioned above, Budd and Jenssen (1987) suggest that\nthe basal traction parameter, B, could be made a function of\nthe basal water depth. Here the subglacial water depth\npredicted from the model is correlated with the B values\nrequired to produce the present-day ice velocity distribution.\nIn order to calculate the required B values for the WAIS\nusing the sliding relation of Equation (11), estimates of the\nbasal shear stress and the sliding velocity are needed. It is\npossible to calculate the basal shear stress for the WAIS\nusing Equation (12) and the surface and ice-thickness\nmeasurements detailed above. The present-day sliding\nvelocity was derived from interfereometric synthetic aper-\nture radar (InSAR) ice surface velocity measurements\n(Joughin and others, 2002), with the deformational com-\nponent (ud) removed using a laminar flow assumption\nud \u00bc 2A \u0005j j\nn\u00021\u0005H\nn \u00fe 1 , \u00f013\u00de\nwhere A is a flow parameter (assumed constant with depth),\nand n is a flow-law exponent (value of 3 used, after Glen,\n1955). A is a temperature-dependent parameter and varies\nby an order of magnitude for ice temperatures between 0\nand \u2013108C (Paterson, 1994). A spatially constant value was\nused here, determined by the comparison of ice-sheet\ndimensions resulting from the application of the thermo-\nmechanical Glimmer ice-sheet model (Rutt and others,\n2009) to the WAIS (Le Brocq, 2007). The Glimmer model\nwas applied using a spatially variable value of A, dependent\non the result of the temperature model within the ice-flow\nmodel. The Glimmer model was also applied using constant\nvalues of A, and the resulting ice-sheet dimensions\ncompared to those resulting from the temperature-depend-\nent model. The constant value of A that most closely\nreproduces the ice-sheet surface from the temperature-\ndependent model was 0.3\u000410\u201316 Pa\u20133 a\u20131 (corresponding to\nan ice temperature of \u201388C) and is therefore used in this\nwork. In inland areas, the deformational velocity will be\nsensitive to the value of A used in Equation (13). However, in\nthese regions, the majority of the velocity is made up of the\ndeformational component, so the calculated sliding velocity\nvalue will be small. In ice-stream regions, the basal shear\nstress is very low, and the surface velocity is high; hence, the\ndeformational component of the velocity will be negligible\nin comparison to the sliding velocity. In tributary regions,\nhowever, the proportion of deformational velocity to sliding\nvelocity will be sensitive to the value of A chosen, hence\nthere is a small degree of uncertainty in the following\ndiscussion with respect to the tributary regions.\nThe spatial distribution of the required basal traction\nparameter for the Ross Sea sector, resulting from Equa-\ntion (10), is shown in Figure 4b (20 km resolution). With the\ntype of sliding relation used here, a traction parameter\nvarying over four orders of magnitude is required (see also\nLingle, 1984) in order to recreate observed WAIS velocities.\nThis variation in magnitude is, in fact, due to the impact of\nice sliding over deformable sediments, which does not\nrequire a high basal shear stress. Where water-saturated\ndeformable sediments exist, the basal shear stress is a\nnegligible component of the sliding relation; as mentioned\nabove, it is the water availability\/void ratio of the sediment\nwhich is the controlling factor on the sediment rheology\nand, hence, the yield stress. Therefore, the traction par-\nameter could still be made a function of the subglacial water\ndepth (following the suggestion by Budd and Jenssen, 1987),\nas a proxy for water availability in the subglacial sediment.\nHence, B is no longer considered to be a \u2018traction\u2019\nparameter, but a \u2018sliding\u2019 parameter.\nThe calculated value of B for the WAIS can now be\nrelated to the subglacial water depth (Fig. 4c and d; from this\npoint onwards, it is only the time-dependent model solution\nwhich is considered). The expected sliding parameter rises\nsharply between water depths of 5 and 10mm, though there\nis still a lot of scatter in the relationship. The general scatter\ncan be attributed to different basal geological conditions,\nand input data uncertainty. A tanh relationship appears to fit\nthe data successfully (shown in Fig. 4, fitted by hand),\nallowing the sliding parameter to increase exponentially for\na limited water depth, and then be smoothly restricted to a\nmaximum value to avoid numerical problems. The existence\nof a \u2018saturation\u2019 point in the relationship between the\nsubglacial water depth and the sliding parameter prevents\nrunaway behaviour in the model, limiting the sliding\nvelocity in regions of large water depths. As the water-film\nmodel is being considered as a parameterization of flow\nfacilitated by saturated subglacial sediments, it would be\nequivalent to highly saturated sediment, which provides very\nlow resistance to flow.\n5 km resolution\nCoupling the 5 km water-depth result to a 5 km resolution\nnumerical ice-flow model is less straightforward. Following\nthe coupling strategy above, an ice-flow model based on the\nshallow-ice approximation would produce fast-flow features\nat the scale of the subglacial \u2018channels\u2019, rather than that\nrepresentative of ice streams. Longitudinal stresses within the\nice serve to smooth the ice sheet\u2019s response to local changes\nin the basal conditions; hence, either a higher-order ice-sheet\nmodel or a smoothed subglacial water distribution is needed.\nA further extension of the work carried out here would be to\ncouple the water-film model with a higher-order ice-flow\nmodel, and investigate the resulting velocity distribution.\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica 885\nDISCUSSION\nGiven the nature of the subglacial water-flow model as a\nsimple parameterization of a complex system, the relation-\nship between the required sliding parameter for the Ross Sea\nice streams and the modelled equilibrium water depth\n(Fig. 4c and d) is encouraging. This is a simple example of\nhow to produce a variable sliding-parameter distribution\nfrom an estimate of sliding and a subglacial hydrology\nmodel. The physics on both sides can be improved in the\nfuture (e.g. using a higher-order ice-flow model to derive B,\nor using a more sophisticated subglacial water model,\nperhaps incorporating non-laminar water flow and non-zero\neffective pressure).\nA coupled ice\/water flow model, using the subglacial\nwater-flowmodel described in this paper, has the potential to\nreproduce the ice-sheet surface, velocity and thermal regime\nof the WAIS successfully. If the steady-state subglacial water-\nflow model is used, there should not be too great an\nadditional computational expense. A fully coupled ice\/water\nflow model (using the time-dependent subglacial water-flow\nmodel) also has the potential to investigate the feedbacks\nbetween the ice-sheet surface and subglacial water system.\nThe main assumption is, however, that the nature of the\nsubglacial water-flow system and its interaction with the\nsubglacial-sediment water capacity can be parameterized by\na water-film model. This may be oversimplifying a complex\nset of interactions and basal conditions that exist in the\ndifferent sectors of the WAIS. A question remains whether it\nis a valid model with which to simulate the evolution of the\nWAIS. The model applied in this paper should reproduce the\ngeneral behaviour of the WAIS, i.e. fast-flowing ice streams\nwith a low ice thickness leading to net subglacial water\nfreeze-on, leading to lower water depths and a slowing of\nthe ice stream. However, it is difficult to reconcile the\ndifference in a water film of millimetres depth with\n(potentially) a few metres of storage in subglacial sediment.\nThe difference in effective \u2018storage capacity\u2019 of the two\nsystems will mean the timescales over which ice streams\nevolve will not be well represented by the water-film model.\nThere are two hydrologic systems, differing in both time\nand length scales, that need to be considered. Firstly, there is\nthe regional-scale drainage system which drains the melt-\nwater generated in the interior of the ice sheet; secondly,\nthere is the local hydrologic system in the subglacial\nFig. 4. Relationship between expected basal sliding parameter and subglacial water depth: (a) subglacial water depth; (b) expected basal\nsliding parameter; (c, d) expected basal sliding parameter plotted against subglacial water depth, all cells where d<15mm.\nLe Brocq and others: A subglacial water-flow model for West Antarctica886\nsediment, which affects sediment rheology and hence its\nyield strength and, ultimately, ice-stream velocity. The\ndegree of interaction between these two systems is not\nknown at present. Two end-members exist, one where there\nis little interaction between meltwater in the regional-scale\ndrainage system and the water in the subglacial sediment,\nand one where the two systems are tightly coupled and any\nchange in regional-scale drainage affects sediment rheology\ndirectly. The model tested in this paper would be more\napplicable to the WAIS if the latter end-member were\nproven to be true. If the two hydrologic systems are not\ntightly coupled, the parameterization presented here would\nnot be appropriate, as the sediment yield strength (and,\nhence, ice sliding velocity) will be independent of the\nregional water flow.\nAn extension of the scheme applied in this paper would\nbe to incorporate a more physically based model of water in\nsubglacial sediments and its role in controlling ice-stream\nevolution. The subglacial water-flow model could then\nprovide information on the redistribution of the basal\nmeltwater, but the basal sliding velocity would be a function\nof the water content of the sediment, rather than the\nthickness of the water film. This type of model would require\nfurther understanding of the nature of the connection\nbetween the regional water flow and the subglacial sedi-\nment, as well as better knowledge of the distribution of\nsubglacial sediments.\nThe model outlined in this paper should therefore be\nconsidered as a first step in reproducing and understanding\nthe nature of the evolution of ice streams and, hence, the\nevolution of the WAIS. A coupled ice\/water flow model\nwould allow the investigation of the interaction of feedbacks\nbetween the ice-sheet morphology and the subglacial water\nsystem.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has applied and evaluated a simple subglacial\nwater model, as a potential parameterization of the sub-\nglacial water system for large-scale ice-sheet models. An\nexample of a model-coupling strategy for a coupled ice\/\nwater flow was demonstrated; however, the methodology\ncan easily be applied to more advanced models, i.e. with\nhigher-order physics incorporated. The approach shows\npotential for reproducing WAIS-type ice surface morph-\nology, velocity and thermal regime in a continental-scale\nice-sheet model. The model also has potential for modelling\nthe impact on ice flow of changes in water-routing\npathways. The approach remains a parameterization, how-\never, and does not reproduce the subglacial water system\nand its interaction with ice flow in a physically correct\nmanner. Further developments need to be made in under-\nstanding the level of interaction between the regional water\nflow and water stored in subglacial sediments before a\nreliable predictive model of the WAIS can exist.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nA.
