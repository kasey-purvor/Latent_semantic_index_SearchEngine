Introduction \nAccessibility is one of the most striking determinants of urban structure. Both early rent \ntheory (Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1969; Muth, 1969), as well as more recent polycentric \nmodels, acknowledge the trade-off between transport cost, and access to firms, em-\nployment opportunities, employees, and customers, from which land values emerge. \nSome of the largest shocks to urban accessibility patterns and, hence, potentially to land \nvalues occurred during the second half of the 19th century in many cities in the indu-\nstrialized world. Emerging railway networks defined completely new patterns of acces-\nsibility and travel behavior. In this realm we use a new archival data set on commercial \nland values to investigate the case of Berlin (1890-1936), one of the most important and \nfastest growing cities in continental Europe, during the period of industrialization. We \nexploit a period where the rapid transit network, consisting of numerous metro-rail and \nsuburban railway lines, was largely established as the backbone of urban transport and \nconsiderably reduced travel time and cost. As shown in our analyses, Berlin represented \na typical monocentric city that can be investigated within the framework of traditional \nrent theory. Based on standard comparative statics of the monocentric model we hypo-\nthesize that a) there was significant decentralization over the time studied in terms of \ndistance to the CBD, b) there was less decentralization in terms of travel time to the \nCBD and c) decentralization in terms of distance can partially be explained by travel \ntime reductions. \nWe highlight that we contribute to a still relatively limited body of evidence. There is a \nlong tradition of empirically testing the theoretical predictions of the monocentric econ-\nomy. However, due to severe data limitations, the majority of studies have been con-\nducted on the basis of population density measures (e.g. Clark, 1951; McDonald, 1989; \nMcMillen, 1994) - although, arguably, the estimation of a bid-rent curve on the basis of \nland values represents the most direct way of testing the monocentric city model. Effec-\ntively, there is still very little evidence available using historical land values outside the \nU.S. or, more precisely, outside Chicago.1 The rich body of excellent studies using the \nhistorical land value data for Chicago is owed to two unique data sources; \u201c100 Years of \n                                            \n1  Further studies exist for Sydney, New York, and Cleveland. \n - 3 - \n \nLand Values\u201d, by Hoyt (1933), who provides land values on square mile tracks from \n1836 to 1928, and \u201cOlcott\u2019s Land Values Blue Book of Chicago\u201d, presenting annual \nestimates for land values at block level since the early 1900s. Aside from these, hardly \nany comparable data sources could be found in the literature.2 The new archival data for \nBerlin, Germany, used in this study, is comparable in quality to that for Chicago and is \neven somewhat more detailed. It is taken from precise city maps at the level of individ-\nual plots (1890-1910) and extensive street indices (1928-1936). After digitizing and \ngeo-processing these sources for use in empirical analyses, we are able to add evidence \nto the evolution of city structure for one of the most dynamic cities in continental Eu-\nrope during the period of industrialization. In particular we provide evidence for a city \nwith a much longer history and therefore a more established city structure than the few \ncities for which evidence is currently available. Our case is also unique in the sense that \nwe investigate a capital city with numerous administrative entities that increase the rela-\ntive importance of the CBD. Most importantly, our analyses make use of digitally-\nprocessed network plans, tracking the evolution of the urban rapid transit system, whose \nlevel of detail is unique in an historical context. Additionally, we construct a counterfac-\ntual least distance network based on exogenous planning objectives, which we use as an \ninstrument in a 2SLS IV strategy in order to address possible endogeneity. The data set \nis presented in the next section followed by the empirical analyses. First, we review \nstandard land gradient estimates for our study area in the realm of international evidence \n(section 3). Second, we provide evidence in support of our three hypotheses described \nabove (section 4). The last section concludes. \n2. Historical Background and Data \n2.1 Industrializing Berlin 1890 \u2013 1936 \nAt the study\u2019s starting point, Prussia in general, and especially Berlin, had entered the \nsecond phase of industrialization. As is typical for industrializing regions, the revolutio-\n                                            \n2  Among the studies using the Hoyt data, Kau and Sirmans (1979), McDonald and McMillen (1990), \nMcMillen (1990), McMillen et al. (1992), McMillen (1996), and Mills (1969) feature most prominent-\nly. Data from \u201cOlcott\u2019s Land Values Blue Book of Chicago\u201d has been used by Bednarz (1975), Berrry \n(1976), McDonald and Bowman (1979), McDonald (1981), McMillen (1979), McDonald and McMil-\nlan (1990), McMillen and McDonald (1991), Mills (1969), and Yates (1965). \n - 4 - \n \nnary changes in production technologies generated enormous demand for a larger labor \nforce, drawing peasants and villagers into the fast-growing cities. In addition, Berlin, \nafter 1871, held the status of the capital for both Prussia and the German Reich, which \nwas formed after the victorious French-Prussian war. This required the building of a \nvariety of new administrative entities, which were incorporated into the CBD and con-\ntributed to the perceived attractiveness of that area. In particular, firms and service-\noriented industries like banks and the media were drawn into its proximity with in-\ncreased physical contact opportunities.  \nDuring the next few decades, a new inner-city public railway network was established \nwithin this environment of high urban concentration. In 1877, the circular line, which \nconnected Berlin to its surroundings and to several regional lines, was inaugurated. \nThen, in 1882, an east-west connection joined several inner city stations with the circu-\nlar line (Borchert, Starck, G\u00f6tz, & M\u00fcller, 1987). But, this was only a first step in gene-\nrating inner-city travel systems and it was not for several decades, that gradually added \nstations created a highly developed, and very dense, network that fundamentally \nchanged the pattern of urban accessibility. The new network provided the opportunity \nfor firms and households to settle in geographically less central boroughs without losing \nthe privilege of excellent accessibility to the core.  \nAnother very influential effect on the urban reorganization process was triggered by the \nso-called Hobrecht Plan, which aimed at a spatial restructuring of streets and boulevards \nas well as the provision of large amounts of new residential areas around the very core \n(the \u201cWilhelminian Ring\u201d).3 However, the allocation of economic activity within that \narea was not explicitly influenced by zoning policies. The development of business \nareas was largely determined by the market (Richter, 1987). The effects of city growth, \nproductivity gains and reduced commuting cost led to constantly increasing levels of \nland valuation until 1914 (Kalweit, 1928; Leyden, 1933). While World War I hardly \naffected Berlin\u2019s housing stock, since the epicenter of combat operations was far away, \nthe troubled economic environment and the hyper-inflation until 1923 complicated the \nassessment of land-related, fair market values. By 1928 capital markets had largely sta-\n                                            \n3 For details see Hegemann (1930) \n - 5 - \n \nbilized facilitating a reassessment of land values. However, prices had only reached pre-\nwar levels in a few locations before another notable downward adjustment occurred, as \nthe economy entered a period of decline and rising unemployment. The subsequent \nprice stop was imposed by Hitler at the end of 1936 in order to impede another inflation \nand therefore did not affect our data.    \n2.2 Land Values \nIn a similar way to McMillen (1996) we restrict our sample to commercial land values. \nOur results can therefore be interpreted strictly with respect to businesses, which are \ntypically assumed to discount distance to the CBD more strongly than households. \nCommercial areas were manually extracted and digitized from a city map created by \nBruno Aust (1986), which displays real land uses at the individual plot level for a large \npart of Berlin in 1940. We obtained 1718 commercially used plots within a 9 kilometer \nradius around the city center. Due to huge losses of raw data, caused by the two wars, \nthe identification of reliable information on land values, covering a sufficiently long \ntime period, proved to be challenging. However, two valuable sources could be re-\ntrieved from Berlin\u2019s historical archives. The first was created by the renowned techni-\ncian Gustav M\u00fcller (1881-1910). In cooperation with official planning authorities he \npresented a collection of very detailed colored maps. These maps were presented in a \nsimilar way to Olcott\u2019s land values, which contributed to Chicago becoming a unique \nlaboratory for Urban Economics in an historical context. M\u00fcller\u2019s maps provide data at \nan astonishingly disaggregated level of individual plots. The stated objective was to \nprovide official and representative guides for both private and public investors partici-\npating in Berlin\u2019s real estate market. While M\u00fcller himself did not explicitly reveal the \nexact procedure of land valuation, the imperial valuation law (Reichsbewertungsgesetz) \nof the German Reich contained a strict order to use capital values for the assessment of \ncommercial plots based on fair market prices. In line with the valuation laws for com-\nmercial land, M\u00fcller claims that his assessment refers to the pure value of land, which is \nadjusted for all building and even garden characteristics. He also corrects for specific \nlocation characteristics such as single and double corner lots, subsoil and courtyard \nproperties. The maps cover an area of similar scope to Bruno Aust\u2019s (1986) map on land \nuses. After scanning and geo-referencing M\u00fcller\u2019s maps within a GIS environment, land \n - 6 - \n \nvalues were assigned to commercial areas, gathering a total sample of 8,101 observa-\ntions for the years 1890, 1896, 1900, 1904, and 1910.  \nThe second source was created by Ferdinand Kalweit (1928, 1936). He was the first to \nprovide detailed information on land prices in Berlin after M\u00fcller. In his function as a \nchartered building surveyor (\u201cgerichtlich beeideter Bausachverst\u00e4ndiger\u201d), he offered \ngreat expertise regarding land valuation procedures, and received a government assign-\nment in order to overcome the lack of documentation created by the troubled environ-\nment of WWI and hyperinflation. Kalweit\u00b4s work resulted in two books containing land \nvalues for all streets in the city in 1928 and 1936. Like M\u00fcller, he followed the explicit \nrules of the imperial valuation law. He additionally considered information on real sales \nas a basis for local adjustments. After controlling for subsoil property and location cha-\nracteristics, he assigned representative minimum and maximum values of the pure land \nvalue to each street. These street stretches were frequently larger than single commer-\ncial areas and often contained non-commercial uses. To the extent possible, we applied \nconsistent rules in order to identify the provided land value information as precisely as \npossible. First, we assume that within residentially and commercially used streets, Kal-\nweit\u2019s upper bound estimate refers to commercial use. Second, if provided values re-\nferred to very long road stretches, land values at sub-stretch level were gathered by con-\nsidering values assigned to crossing roads. In addition, a colored map for 1938, pre-\npared by Runge (1950), which shows many similarities to the M\u00fcller maps, served as a \nguidance. Runge received an official assignment from authorities after WWII in order to \nprovide an overview of land values based on the pre-WWII situation. Due to a lack of \ncomprehensive documentation, this map was not considered a primary source in the \nanalyses but nevertheless provided valuable information and crosschecks on the spatial \nstructure during the interwar-period. The extracted Kalweit data provide an additional \n3,420 observations, so the whole sample of historical land values amounts to 11,521 \nobservations. Table 1 provides summary statistics that reflect the historical evidence \nlaid out in the previous section, in particular the positive and negative trends before and \nafter WWI. \nTAB 1 ABOUT HERE \n - 7 - \n \nA brief description of data used in studies that we consider as benchmarks for our re-\nsults follows. The most impressive data set so far has been used by McMillen (1996). \nWithin the period until 1928 it is taken from Hoyt (1933) who provides the values of \nsquare mile tracts between 1836 and 1928, ranging from 94 to 148 observations each \nyear. From 1960 to 1990, McMillen uses commercial land values, published in Olcott`s \nbook on land values. The detailed block level allows for 696 to 721 observations each \nyear. Smith (2003) uses a random sample of plot sales for his survey on Cleveland. This \nmostly consists of residential areas totaling 61 to 125 observations a year between 1915 \nand 1980. New York data (Atack & Margo, 1998) are based on the prices of vacant land \npublished in newspapers and provide 72 to 208 observations for the years 1835 to \n1900.4 For a more recent period, from 1931 to 1989, Abelson (1997) uses a sample of \nrandomly selected residential areas within Sydney\u2019s 22 local government regions, rang-\ning from 1800 to 4400 observations. \n2.3 Railway Network \nThe generation of a travel-time based, centrality indicator that accounts for transport \ninfrastructure basically consisted of three steps. First, we traced back the evolution of \nthe city\u2019s complete public railway network including up to 222 stations, over the course \nof our study period in order to form digital maps.5 The total length of the network, as \ncalculated within a GIS environment, amounted to more than 410 kilometers in 1936, \nwhich is close to the same size of the contemporary network (475 km). Second, repre-\nsentative velocities needed to be defined for train and non-train trips as a prerequisite \nfor the calculation of travel times. Historical network plans provided information on \nbilateral travel times between adjacent stations, separately presented for the suburban \nrailway and metro lines. Summing up the indicated trip times (in minutes), and merging \nthem with our replicated digital network, yields an almost constant average train veloci-\n                                            \n4   Due to direct taxation on property sales, Atack & Margo (1998) state that published prices may be \nbiased. Another interesting work on New York stems from Margo (1998), who exploits rental prices of \nhousing in New York City from 1830 to 1860 and finds that the relative price of housing rose in that \nperiod. \n5  For all following arguments, relevant information and network plans can be found at: \nhttp:\/\/www.bahnstrecken.de\/indexf.htm; http:\/\/www.bahnstrecken.de\/bse.htm;   \nhttp:\/\/berlineruntergrundbahn.de\/;  www.stadtschnellbahn-berlin.de; www.berliner-verkehr.de. \n - 8 - \n \nty of 33.8 km\/h over the complete period for both suburban and metro rail lines. Unfor-\ntunately, it is hard to avoid some arbitrariness in the definition of non-train related trip \nvelocities. On the basis of an approximation of the modal split, based on historical \nsources, we set a speed of 1\/3 of the calculated train velocity to reflect a combined aver-\nage speed of walking, bus- and streetcar-rides, while at the same time keeping our mod-\nels as simple and comprehensive as possible.6 Third, following Ahlfeldt(2010), the ac-\ntual travel times from our predefined commercial areas to the identified CBD were cal-\nculated as the fastest combined train and non-train network trip, taking the abovemen-\ntioned velocities as given. Agents are free to choose whether to take a rapid train ser-\nvice, or not, in order to arrive at the city center. Their decision is solely based on the \nminimum time spent for the whole trip. If they choose rapid rail transit, their journey \nconsists of a combined network path of a non-train trip to the next station, and a combi-\nnation of a train ride along the network with a final non-train trip to the city center, \nwhich minimizes travel time.  \n3. Land Gradient Evolution in International Comparison \nThis section provides estimates of historical land gradients in Berlin, which are dis-\ncussed against the background of international evidence. The point of departure for our \nempirical analysis is the standard monocentric city model in which firms bid higher \nprices for land closer to an exogenous CBD due to lower transport costs and\/or travel \ntime savings (Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1969; Muth, 1969). Evidence suggesting that land \nvalues (LV) may be well-described by an exponential function of distance to the CBD \n(distCBD) is available for the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Sydney \n(Atack & Margo, 1998; Kau & Sirmans, 1979; McDonald & McMillen, 1990; McMil-\nlen, 1990, 1996; McMillen et al., 1992; Mills, 1969; Smith, 2003). The exponential \nfunctional relationship is usually estimated using the well-established log-linear specifi-\ncation. \n                                            \n6  Historical sources report a relative high velocity due to a dense network of streetcars and buses \u2013 even \nin peripheral areas. In 1934, 72 streetcar lines covered 638 km and bus lines summed up to 343 km \n(Beier, 1990; Bley, 2003; Borchert et al., 1987; Dittfurth, 1993; Hoffmann-Axthelm, 1982). \n - 9 - \n \nititit distCBDLV \u03b5\u03b2\u03b1 \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d)log(   (1) \nParameter \u03b1 corresponds to the log of land value in the city center, while \u03b2 gives the \npercentage change in land value as one moves 1 kilometer away from the CBD and \u03b5it is \nan error term satisfying the usual conditions. As the gradient node \u2013 the CBD \u2013 we \nchoose a point on the prestigious Friedrichstrasse, halfway to the famous boulevards \nUnter den Linden and Leipziger Strasse. The continuing centrality of this location is \nreflected by the nearby metro station \u201cStadtmitte\u201d (downtown).7 \nTable 2 shows parameter estimates corresponding to equation (1). In line with the pre-\ndictions of the monocentric model, our estimates yield significant and negative coeffi-\ncients on distance to the CBD (distCBD) and suggest a steeply descending land gradient \nduring the period of observation, flattening from a 75.5% decrease per kilometer in \n1890 to 35.9% in 1936. LM-tests for spatial dependency indicate the presence of a li-\nmited degree of spatial autocorrelation. Since test scores reject the spatial lag-model in \nfavor of an error-correction model, spatial dependencies are most likely to be caused by \nomitted variables correlated across space or spatial measurement errors (Anselin & Be-\nra, 1996). Application of spatial error correction models, however, yield qualitatively \nsimilar results.8  \nTAB 2 ABOUT HERE \n                                            \n7  We also employed a more flexible specification estimating the gradient node as a function of geo-\ngraphic coordinates. However, we did not find a systematic variation in the location of these estimated \ncenters, with nodes located within 0.6 km (0.375 miles) of our CBD proxy in all years. The following \nspecification has been estimated using a non-linear, least squares estimator, where XCBD (east\/west) and \nYCBD (north\/south) describe the location of the CBD as coordinates given in units of projected km and \nXi and Yi are the same referring to location i. titiCBDitCBDti YYXXLV \u03b5\u03b2\u03b1 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d 5.022 ))()(()log( . Results \nare available from the authors.  \n8 We chose a row-standardized weights matrix (W), where transactions within a distance band of 300 \nmeters are treated as neighbors. This weights matrix provides the best fit compared to alternative speci-\nfications and minimizes the Akaike and Schwarz criteria. Exemplarily, LM test scores (p-values) for \n1890 are: LMlag = 0.000, LMerror = 0.000, robust LMlag = 0.256 robust LMerror = 0.000, which indicate \nthe appropriateness of estimating a spatial error model. Formally, the error correction model that we \nestimate, employing a maximum likelihood estimator, corrects for the spatial structure of the error term \nin equation (1) as follows: \u03bc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b5 \uf02b\uf03d , where, \u03bc is an independent and identically distributed vector \nof error terms. Results, however, remain qualitatively unchanged and are available from the authors.  \n - 10 - \n \nBesides the evident decentralization reflected in a decrease in the marginal value of be-\ning located closer to the CBD, it is notable that the model fit in Table 2 declines consi-\nderably after 1910, indicating either that the monocentric structure of the city was \nbreaking up, or that omitted location characteristics account for a larger spatial variation \nin land values.9 In addition to the distance to the CBD, the productivity of commercial \nland, the quality of public services, as well as land taxation are mirrored in land values. \nTherefore discontinuities in the land gradient may arise at the boundaries between intra-\nurban jurisdictions. Greater-Berlin, during the study period, comprised of numerous \ncommunities (Ortsteile) whose authorities were encouraged to set up services and taxes \nlocally (Richter, 1987). In order to account for potential discontinuities, we re-estimate \nequation (1) including fixed effects for up to 48 communities within our study area.10 \nResults are presented in Table 3. In comparison to Table 2, gradients are slightly flatter, \nbut the degree of decentralization over time remains almost the same. From 1890 to \n1936, the marginal value of being located 1 kilometer closer to the CBD accordingly \ndiminishes from 73.8% to 30%. Notably, the coefficients of determination increase for \nall years, with the by far most substantial changes occurring in 1929 and 1936. These \nresults indicate that, even in the mid 20th century, proximity to the CBD, together with \ncommunity specific characteristics, account for three quarters of the spatial variation in \nland values.  \nTAB 3 ABOUT HERE \nAs noted, the majority of empirical tests of the monocentric city model have been con-\nducted on the basis of population density measures (e.g. Clark, 1951; McDonald, 1989; \nMcMillen, 1994). Besides being general supportive with respect to the overall implica-\ntions of the model, these studies yield some specific results. Accordingly, larger cities \n                                            \n9  Since the data source changes from 1910 to 1929, there is also the slight possibility that a higher vola-\ntility is attributable to the method of land value assessment. \n10 It\u2019s noteworthy that during the 1920's a prominent sub-center emerged along the boulevards \nKurf\u00fcstendamm and Tauentziehnstra\u00dfe, which later grew to the centre of West-Berlin during the post-\nwar division period. We run unpublished robustness checks where we, following Ahlfeldt & Wendland \n(2009), extend the baseline specification by a dummy variable denoting the area within 1 km of Breit-\nscheidplatz. While the resulting coefficients are positive and statistically significant, in particular after \n1910, the point estimates for the gradient coefficients only change at the third decimal place. \n - 11 - \n \nexhibit flatter gradients \u2013 possibly due to decentralization of economic activity \u2013 while \ndensities in older cities tend to be more concentrated towards the downtown areas. Due \nto the limited evidence, very few attempts have been made to estimate historical land \ngradients outside Chicago. The few exceptions include U.S. cities (Cleveland and New \nYork) and Sydney. In this context, the case of Berlin is particularly valuable, because it \nadds evidence not only for the first European city, but also for a city with a particularly \nlong history and the first capital city with important governmental institutions within the \nboundaries of the CBD. Table 4 compares the existing international evidence for histor-\nical land gradients. In line with the evidence for Chicago (McMillen, 1996), Cleveland \n(Smith, 2003), New York (Atack & Margo, 1998) and Sydney (Abelson, 1997), we find \na flattening gradient and decreasing coefficients of determination over time. Notably, \nour estimated decay coefficients are larger compared to most previous studies, including \nMcMillen (1996), who also restricted the sample to commercial land values. These large \ncoefficients reflect a very high concentration of economic activity within a relatively \nsmall core area. Very high transport costs, which could be typical for relatively old ci-\nties, in principle, could account for such a dense concentration. However, this explana-\ntion is not very persuasive since following the implementation of the Hobrecht plan \nBerlin possessed a network of spacious boulevards and, at least by the end of the obser-\nvation period, a well-developed public transport network, which will receive more at-\ntention in the next section. The relatively steep gradient estimates are also unlikely to be \nexplained by the size of the city since Berlin does not feature among the particularly \nsmall cities considered in Table 4. While for the available years, gradient estimates are \ncomparable to Cleveland, Berlin, in terms of population, exceeded the city of Cleveland \nby roughly a factor of five.11 In contrast, although Berlin and Chicago were roughly of \nthe same size during the study period, the magnitude of gradient estimates is much larg-\ner for Berlin than for Chicago. However, there are at least two aspects that distinguish \nBerlin from the other cities in Table 4 \u2013 its relatively high age and its role as a capital \ncity. Notably, the CBD by the end of our observation period, hardly exceeded the boun-\ndaries of the historic downtown district established hundreds of years ago (Elkins & \n                                            \n11 Population in 1900: Berlin, 1,888,848; Chicago, 1,698,575; Cleveland, 381,768; New York, 3,437,202; \nSydney, about 500,000. \n - 12 - \n \nHofmeister, 1988; Leyden, 1933). The particular importance of being located close to \nthe CBD in Berlin might therefore be related to both its historically established position \nand the various administrative entities that concentrated within the CBD boundaries, as \nthe city held the status as capital for both Prussia and the German Reich. More studies \ninvestigating land gradients in historic cities are desirable to affirm this notion. \nTAB 4 ABOUT HERE  \n4. The Impact of Accessibility \nIn this section we turn our attention to some simple hypotheses derived from the mono-\ncentric city model regarding the adjustment of land values to travel cost reductions: a) A \nreduction in transport cost relatively increases the bids for parcels of land in the urban \nperiphery at the expense of central locations, which is mirrored in a flattening land gra-\ndient in terms of distance. b) Assuming that perceived transport cost are largely deter-\nmined by the opportunity cost of travel time, the decline in the marginal benefit of being \nlocated closer to the CBD over time will be lower in terms of travel time than in terms \nof distance if transport innovations are a significant driving force of the overall decen-\ntralization process. This implies a flattening of the land gradient that is less pronounced \nin terms of travel time than in terms of distance. c) Under the assumptions made, the \nevolution of travel time will explain a significant proportion of the overall decentraliza-\ntion process in terms of distance, which in turn means that in the absence of transport \ninnovations the city would have experienced a lower degree of decentralization.  \nDistance vs. travel time \nAs noted, Berlin during the study period makes a good case for testing these hypothes-\nes, as the peak time of industrialization brought forth the implementation of the rapid \ntransport network, which exhibited a pronounced impact on accessibility along its lines. \nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate how, in terms of travel time, the CBD became more accessible \nfrom remote locations and the concentric form of CBD-accessibility broke up into a \nmore complex pattern. Note that the travel time measure strictly refers to the fastest \njourney to the CBD whereby agents are allowed to choose whether to use rapid transit \nlines for a part of the journey or not. As the use of rapid transit lines in general was af-\nfordable (Bley, 2003) and, hence, opportunity cost of travel time dominated physical \n - 13 - \n \ndistance in terms of perceived accessibility, land values should essentially be affected \nby these major transport innovations. \n[FIG 1 ABOUT HERE] \n[FIG 2 ABOUT HERE] \nAddressing endogeneity \nIn order to assess the marginal impact of travel time to the CBD on the value of land \nand how the marginal impact changes over time, we substitute distance to CBD (equa-\ntion 1) with the travel times displayed in Figure 2 , which yields equation (2). If focal \nblocks, areas, and municipalities within the boundaries of Berlin were randomly as-\nsigned for connection or connected due to considerations that were entirely exogenous \nto the economic development, estimation of equation (2) using OLS would yield un-\nbiased coefficients.  \n   (2) \nExogeneity in this sense is supported by several historical sources, which clearly indi-\ncate the unexpected outcomes regarding the routing of many lines due to long-lasting \npolitical processes, as well as a speculative environment, in which newly establishment \nlines were to connect entirely unpopulated areas. The connection of the Kurf\u00fcrsten-\ndamm area, which later became the major secondary center of pre-WWII Berlin, and the \nmajor center during the period of the city\u00b4s division, by the first metro-lines when the \narea was hardly developed at all, only represents the most striking and prominent exam-\nple (Bohm, 1980; Ribbe, 1987). In many other cases the stated objective was to connect \nremote municipalities in order to stimulate the settlement behavior within the outer \nrings and the economic interactions with the CBD. However, the argument that some \nlines may have been built to meet already existing demand structures, which raises the \nintuitive concern that planners may have targeted areas with higher expected economic \nreturns on the way between two termini, cannot completely be rejected.  \nTo reject these endogeneity concerns, we introduce instruments for travel time to the \nCBD, which have to satisfy the following conditions: a) being (spatially) correlated with \nlog(LVit ) \uf03d \uf061 \uf02b \uf062 ttCBDit \uf02b \uf065it\n - 14 - \n \nthe measures displayed in Figures 1 and 2, b) only using variation provided by \u201cex-\nogenous\u201d requirements that affected the design of the network, c) only impacting on \nland value via a reducing travel time, which is the identifying assumption. To meet \nthese criteria we constructed a hypothetical minimum cost network. The rationale for \nthe network is derived from the shortest paths (straight-line) planners could have chosen \nin order to connect the CBD with focal municipalities outside Berlin. Additionally, the \nstraight lines are connected by a circular line, which is consistent with existent networks \nin many European cities (see Fig.A1).12 We started with connecting 12 municipalities \nthat lie outside the borders of even the contemporary Berlin, which were chosen to be \nimportant destinations along the suburban railway lines (Bley, 2003). Additionally, it is \nknown that the area around the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm was to be subdued in order to generate \na representative boulevard for Kaiser Wilhelm. He used this formerly completely unde-\nveloped pathway to reach one of his residences in the southwest (Schloss Grunewald). \nWe consequently constructed another line to address this fact. The straight-line network \npresents a credible way to address concerns of non-random routing on the way between \nthe CBD and focal municipalities as it is developed acknowledging the requirement of \nconnecting the city\u00b4s centre to the closest centers outside the city. Whether a location \nalong these straight-lines becomes connected is exogenous to its own economic devel-\nopment.  \nUnder the identifying assumption that the straight-line distance to the CBD is only af-\nfecting the evolution of land values by directly influencing the effective travel times, we \nemploy a 2SLS IV strategy where we use the following first-stage estimation equation \nto ensure that the error term is uncorrelated with travel times in the second stage equa-\ntion (2).  \n (3) \n                                            \n12 The radius of the hypothetical circular line (5.3 km) corresponds to the average radius around the CBD \nneeded in order to connect the outer parts of the Wilhelminian Ring (see 2.1). The original circular line \n(1877) had been built around the Wilhelminian Ring with the intention to allow workers to settle with-\nin remote districts without losing the privilege of acceptable accessibility to the employment center. \nittiititiit nwdistCBDdistCBDnwdistpopdttCBD \uf076\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d ,43,21,10  x \n - 15 - \n \nwhere popdi,t-1  indicates the 10 year-lagged population density within block i, nwdisti,t \nis the straight-line distance of block i\u2019s geographical centroid to the closest point of our \nhypothetical network, distCBDi  is the distance to the CBD, and CBD x nwdisti,t  is an \ninteractive term including the distance to the CBD and to the network. Standard specifi-\ncation test suggest that OLS results would be biased and confirm the strength of the \nused instruments.13 The following analyses are carried out using the predicted values for \nttCBD. \nResults based on the log-linear specification presented in the section above indicate a \nconsiderable flattening of the land gradient (in terms of distance) over our study period. \nWhile this functional form is well established in the literature and satisfies the convexity \nrequirement in the negative distance price relationship predicted by urban rent theory, \nrecent literature has made considerable advances in applying new regressions tech-\nniques that allow estimating the functional form much more flexibly (see McMillen, \n2010 for a review). As noted above, our strategy of estimating the causal effect the de-\nvelopment of the transportation network had on decentralization relies on a two-stage \nstrategy where the availability of instruments restricts the degree to which we can allow \nfor flexibility in our benchmark specifications. For the purpose of a descriptive analysis \nof the relationship between land values and distance and travel time respectively we \nemploy a non-parametric, locally-weighted regression approach to identify how the un-\nknown gradient functions change over time.14  \nFigure 3a visualizes the non-parametric estimates for the relationship between the log of \nland value, normalized to the median, and the distance to the CBD in kilometers for \nselected years. Results confirm that over the study period, peripheral areas gained in \nvalue relative to more central areas. They also show that the log-linear approximation \nfits best for the period from 1900 to 1910, while in 1890 there is a relatively sharp dis-\ncontinuity at a distance of about 6 kilometers and gradients for 1929 and 1936 exhibit a \nconsiderable degree of convexity. A clearly negative relationship between land valua-\n                                            \n13 The appendix provides first stage results for IV estimates (Tab.A1) as well as the test statistics Tab \nA3). \n14  See Ahlfeldt (2010), Cleveland & Devlin (1988) McMillen (1996, 2004) for applications of the same \ntechnique. \n - 16 - \n \ntion and access to the city center is also evident in terms of travel time (Figure 3b). \nMoreover, the log-linear approximation seems to fit best for 1900 and, again, there is \nsome convexity apparent in the 1929 and 1936 gradients. In terms of decentralization, \nhowever, the picture is much less clear than in Figure 3a. While there is some relative \nincrease in peripheral areas from 1890 to 1900, the gradients for the following years are, \nif at all, indicative for a modest re-centralization. Rather than to promote the appro-\npriateness of the log-linear specification over any alternative, we view these results as \ndescriptive evidence that the process of decentralization was less pronounced when ex-\npressed in terms of travel time than distance and that the log-linear specification pro-\nvides a feasible approximation of the true functional form in the realm of our two-stage \nstrategy, in particular when travel times are considered.  \n[FIG3 ABOUT HERE] \nFigures 3a and 3b, thus, support our hypotheses of significant decentralization in terms \nof distance to the CBD (a) and a lower degree of decentralization in terms of travel \ntimes (b).15 In order to provide a formal test of these hypotheses, we estimate the fol-\nlowing specification using a pooled data set.16 \nitjtu utiutiit\nyeardistCBDdistCBDLV \uf065\uf06a\uf062\uf062 \uf02b\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf03d \uf0e5)log(  (4) \nWhere u stands for all years included in Table 2 with the exception of 1936; yearu is a \ndummy variable denoting year u and \u03c6jt is a full set of fixed effects denoting areas i \nwithin an \u201cOrtsteil\u201c (community) j in a given year t. Equation (4) is estimated both for \ndistance to the CBD (distCBD) as well as using the predicted travel time to the CBD \n(ttCBD) obtained from the first-stage IV regressions (equation 3); in each case with and \nwithout fixed effects \u03c6jt.17 Coefficient estimates for \u03b2u that are negative and satisfy con-\n                                            \n15 Note that Figure 3b is constructed using the predicted values taken from the IV estimates. As a robust-\nness check we also plot the original values (ttcbd), which are presented in the appendix and yield a \nconsistent picture.  \n16 A more flexible functional form (e.g. a spline) would surely be favourable to formally test for decen-\ntralization (see McMillen 2010 for a review). However, only being able to use one instrument for \ntravel time we chose the standard exponential function.   \n17  Note that if \u201cOrtsteil\u201d fixed effects are omitted, year effects are included instead. \n - 17 - \n \nventional significance criteria are indicative of significant decentralization between year \nu and 1936.  \nEstimation results corresponding to specification (4) are presented in Table 5. Based on \ncolumn (1) and (2) results, we can reject the hypothesis that the estimated distance gra-\ndients are of the same magnitude as in 1936, for all years but 1929 based on conven-\ntional significance criteria. The negative coefficients imply that significant decentraliza-\ntion occurred between year u and 1936. These results are consistently found in columns \n(1) and (2), revealing that our results are robust to local policies that potentially vary \nacross jurisdictions and time. The marginal value of being located 1 kilometer closer to \nthe CBD, according to column (1), decreased by as much as 52.5 % (58.2% for column \n(2)) over our study period (\u0d63\u07da \u0d48 1890\u0de3 \u0d67\/\u0d63\u07da\u1218 \u0d45 \u07da \u0d48 1890\u0de3 \u0d67).  \nTaking travel times as a basis, however, we cannot reject the hypothesis that gradient \nestimates are of the same (or a larger) magnitude as in 1936 for all years, but 1890 and \n1896. Hence, we cannot affirm any significant decentralization in terms of travel time \nfrom 1900 to 1936, which stands in strong contrast to our results obtained for the dis-\ntance gradients. Again, results are consistently found whether \u201cOrtsteile\u201d fixed effects \nare considered (3) or not (4). Referring to the whole period from 1890 to 1936, the mar-\nginal value of reducing travel time to the CBD by 1 minute declined by 29.2% (column \n3) or 37.1% (column 4) respectively. While the significant decentralization that oc-\ncurred prior to 1900 in terms of travel time clearly points to additional driving forces for \ndecentralization besides the reduction in travel time, we note that the results presented \nin Figure 3 and Table 5 are nevertheless strongly in support of our hypotheses a) and b). \nWe also emphasize that estimates obtained using the travel time measures outperform \nthe corresponding results obtained for distances both in terms of overall explanatory \npower (R2) and standard information criteria (AIC). \n[TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE] \nCounterfactual \nIn the last step of our analysis we focus on a quantitative assessment of the degree to \nwhich the transport network promoted decentralization. As noted, the dynamic envi-\nronment of industrial revolution, which is reflected in a population that more than qua-\n - 18 - \n \ndrupled over the study period, offers a range of alternative explanations for decentrali-\nzation. Not least, the rapid city-growth caused planning authorities to decide to widen \nand completely restructure large parts of the city, even including surrounding communi-\nties and towns. The so-called Hobrecht-Plan was implemented in 1862 and led to far-\nreaching building and reorganization processes until 1914 (Hegemann, 1930). Within an \narea of more than 85 km2, it created new high-density residential space combined with \nthe concept of mixed-use development.18 This was especially true along the representa-\ntive boulevards, which in many cases led radially away from, or in circles around the \nold CBD and where large proportions were dedicated to commercial areas. The new \ndevelopment plan clearly favored the decentralization of employment, population and \nmarket opportunities.  \nUsing again a pooled dataset, we employ the following specifications to identify the \nyearly change in the land gradient as a measure of decentralization, and how this meas-\nure reacts if we control for the evolution of travel times: \nittitziiit ttCBDtrenddistCBDdistCBDLV \u03b5\u03b7\u03b4\u03b3\u03b2 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf03d)log(  (5) \nwhere trendz is a yearly trend variable that takes a value of 0 in 1890, ttCBDit is the tra-\nvel time to the CBD in year t at location i (predicted value) and \u03b7t is set of year dum-\nmies. Parameter \u03b3 gives an estimate of the average yearly change in the marginal value \nof distance to the CBD over our study period. A positive and statistically significant \ncoefficient, hence, indicates decentralization. Equation (5) is estimated both with and \nwithout travel times (ttCBDit). The difference in the parameter estimates are interpreted \nas the proportion of decentralization that can be explained by the evolution of travel \ntimes. Estimation results are presented in Table 6. Column (1) results indicate that over \nthe study period, the marginal price effect of proximity to the CBD declined by 0.6 per-\ncentage points per annum (distCBD x trend). This figure diminishes to 0.2 if travel \ntimes are introduced into the model (2). These reductions correspond to a percentage \n                                            \n18 Area estimated within a GIS environment on the basis of georeferenced historic maps. \n - 19 - \n \ndecline of 71.77%.19 Analogous estimates are provided in columns (3-8) for selected \nobservations periods. Notably, estimated \u03b3 coefficients diminish over time, revealing a \ndeclining dynamic of the decentralization process. Our estimates further suggest that the \nproportion explained by travel times varied considerably over time. For the period from \n1890 to 1900 only a relatively small proportion of decentralization of 19.42% can be \nexplained by the evolution of travel time to the CBD (3-4). This indicates that during \nthis first period other factors besides the transport network might have had a more do-\nminant effect on the spatial reorganization process. Chief among a range of potential \nexplanations might be the realization of the Hobrecht-Plan, a major urban development \nplan, which amplified increasing densities at intermediate distances from the CBD \n(Strohmeyer, 2000), and could have dominated the effects of the emerging transport \nnetwork. This relationship reverts after 1900, when the numbers raise to the considera-\nble magnitudes of 74.97% in 1910-1936 and even 99.92% in 1900-1910, suggesting that \nthe evolution of the transport network was one of the, if not, the key driving force of \ndecentralization. \n[TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE] \n5. Conclusion \nIn this study we have provided evidence for the positive impact of accessibility on the \nproductivity of commercial land, using the evolution of the rapid transport network in \nBerlin, from 1890 to 1936, as a case study. We have introduced a new archival land-\nvalue data-set, which is unique in terms of detail for European, historically grown, and \ncapital cities. We have shown that a) over the study period the city experienced a consi-\nderable degree of decentralization, which was a typical phenomenon during the study \nperiod. International comparison reveals relatively steep bivariate gradient estimates, \npointing to the marginal value of being located 1 kilometer closer to the CBD that dimi-\nnishes from 75.5% to 35.9% over time. These gradients are steep in international com-\n                                            \n19  The percentage decline is calculated as 100)\u02c6\/\u02c61( \uf0b4\uf02d \u03b3\u03b3c , where the \uf067\u02c6  )\u02c6( c\uf067 is the coefficient esti-\nmate on distCBD x trend without (with) control for travel time (ttCBD) obtained from the estimation of \nequations (5). \n - 20 - \n \nparison, which is potentially explained by the more established city structure or the cap-\nital role. More cases, however, are required to affirm this notion.  \nClearly, Berlin even by the mid of the 20th century is well-described as an monocentric \neconomy, as almost 75% of the variation in land value can be explained by the log-\nlinear land gradient, if we allow for discontinuities at boundaries between jurisdictions \n(Ortsteile\/communities) that collect taxes and provide services locally. Tracking the \nevolution of the rapid transit network on the basis of geo-processed historic network \nplans, which we instrument using a counterfactual least distance network to reject endo-\ngineity concerns, we have further shown that b) the marginal value of being located \ncloser to the CBD diminished considerably less in terms of travel time  (29.2- 37.1%), \nthan in terms of distance (53.0-59.5%). Finally, our results have revealed that c), the \nevolution of travel time explains a significant proportion of about, on average, 71.77% \nof the overall decentralization process in terms of distance. When applying travel time \nmeasures the overall explanatory power as well as standard information criteria outper-\nform traditional measures of distance to CBD. \nIn all, our results are strongly in support of accessibility as an important determinant of \nthe spatial structure of cities in general, and as a central part of classical urban rent \ntheory in particular. Variation in transport costs, due to improvements in infrastructure, \nis counterbalanced by an adjustment in land value, as predicted by theory. While almost \nthe entire decentralization process after 1900 can be explained by reduced effective \ntransport costs, other factors such as increasing demand for land, city growth, and urban \ndevelopment policies also contributed to the effective flattening of the land gradient, in \nparticular prior to 1900. \n  \n - 21 - \n \nFig. 1 Travel Time to CBD 1890 \n \nNotes: Map shows spatially interpolated travel times using ordinary kriging with a spherical \nsemivariogram model. \nSource: Urban and Environmental Information System of the Senate Department Berlin (2006), Net-\nwork Plans. \n  \n - 22 - \n \nFig. 2 Travel Time to CBD 1936 \n \nNotes: Map shows spatially interpolated travel times using ordinary kriging with a spherical \nsemivariogram model. \nSource: Urban and Environmental Information System of the Senate Department Berlin (2006), Net-\nwork Plans. \n  \n - 23 - \n \nFig. 3 Non-parametric gradient estimates \nNotes: Own illustration.  \n \n  \n - 24 - \n \nTab. 1 Summary Statistics on Land Valuation \n 1890 1896 1900 1904 1910 1929 1936 \nMean 176.97 223.95 268.94 309.87 398.41 228.85 204.35 \nMedian 100 150 168 208 278 101.67 96.67 \nSD 229.46 267.61 301.75 327.19 388.54 321.29 293.32 \nObs. 1479 1624 1683 1686 1681 1709 1711 \n - 25 - \n \nTab. 2 Land Gradient 1890 \u2013 1936 (OLS) \n 1890 1896 1900 1904 1910 1929 1936 \nConst (\u03b1) 6.877** 6.811** 6.874** 7.000** 7.104** 6.173** 6.064** \n (0.042) (0.027) (0.027) (0.026) (0.026) (0.042) (0.041) \nDist. to -0.755** -0.566** -0.493** -0.479** -0.418** -0.364** -0.359** \nCBD (\u03b2) (0.016) (0.009) (0.008) (0.008) (0.008) (0.011) (0.011) \nObs. 1479 1624 1683 1686 1681 1708 1711 \nR2 0.74 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.7 0.44 0.46 \nNotes: Endogenous variable is log of land value (LV) in RM\/sqm in all models.
