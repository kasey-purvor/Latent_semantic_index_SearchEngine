We propose a consistent three-body model reaction methodology in \nwhich we constrain the transferred-neutron bound state and nucleon-target optical \npotential geometries using modern Hartree-Fock calculations. Our deduced neutron \nspectroscopic factors are found to be suppressed by ~30% relative to independent-particle \nshell-model values, from 40Ca through 49Ca. The other nuclei studied, ranging from B to \nTi, show similar average suppressions with respect to large-basis shell-model \nexpectations. Our results are consistent with deduced spectroscopic strengths for neutrons \nand protons from intermediate energy nucleon knockout reactions, and for protons from \n(e,e\u2032p) reactions, on well-bound nuclei. \n \nPACS: 24.50.+g, 24.10.Eq, 25.40.-h, 25.45.-z \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n 1\n The shell model of atomic nuclei was proposed more than half a century ago by \nMayer and Jensen [1], for which they shared the 1963 Nobel Prize for Physics. This \nsimple independent-particle picture, that requires each nucleon to occupy a single-particle \neigenstate (orbital) in the nuclear mean-field potential, has been immensely robust and \nsuccessful in describing both systematic and specific features of nuclear structures. \nModern shell model calculations also include the effects of residual interactions between \nthese single-nucleon degrees of freedom by the use of microscopic interactions or of \neffective forces fitted to empirical nuclear masses, charge radii and low-lying excited \nstate spectra, e.g. [2]. Quantifying the ordering, spacing and the resulting distribution of \nsingle particle strength among these nucleon states is essential for assessing the evolution \nof nuclear structures in regions of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei.  \nThese single-particle degrees of freedom are studied quantitatively using direct \nnuclear reactions, such as single-nucleon transfer, nucleon knockout and elastic break-up \nreactions. When experiments are well chosen, they can interrogate the dominant strength \nassociated with the state of a single nucleon. More precisely they are sensitive to the \nsingle-nucleon overlap functions, the norms of which are the spectroscopic factors (SFs) \nof the measured transitions, see e.g. [3]. Extensive attempts have been made to deduce \nnucleon SFs using direct reactions induced by both hadronic and electronic probes. Such \nanalyses are still not fully understood, often revealing model-dependence and raising \nconcerns of the capability to determine SFs in an absolute sense. Transfer reactions \ncontinue to be an important technique to populate and to help elucidate the structure of \nrare nuclei, in particular those produced as lower energy secondary beams. Thus it is \nimportant to clarify the techniques for SF determinations using single-nucleon transfer \nreactions and reduce their uncertainties.  \nA significant body of (e,e\u2032p) reaction analyses suggest that proton SF values deduced \nfrom nuclei near closed shells, including 40Ca, are suppressed by about 30-40% compared \nto independent particle model (IPM) expectations [4]. This suppression has been \nattributed, in different proportions, to short- and medium-range (tensor) nucleon-nucleon \ncorrelation effects and to longer-range correlations arising from couplings, by nucleons \nnear the Fermi surface, to collective degrees of freedom. More recently, quantitatively \nsimilar suppressions have been required to reconcile measurements of both single-proton \n 2\nand single-neutron knockout reactions from a range of nuclei, both stable [5] and unstable \n[5,6], with reaction theory predictions.  \nHistorically, conventional distorted waves Born approximation (DWBA) transfer \nreaction analyses have shown little need for such a systematic suppression of single-\nparticle strength [7, 8]. Marked differences in proton SFs extracted from the (e,e\u2032p) and \n(d,3He) proton transfer reaction analyses were reconciled by a reanalysis of the (d,3He) \ndata [4], requiring significant changes to the (DWBA) (d,3He) calculations used there. \nThese included fine-tuning of the root mean squared (rms) radii of the active proton \nsingle particle orbitals to be consistent with the (e,e\u2032p) data analysis. In this paper we \nassess related effects in (d,p) and (p,d) neutron transfer reactions by constraining the \ngeometry of the nucleon optical interactions with the target and the active (transferred) \nneutron orbital rms radii using modern Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations [9]. In this way \nwe not only reduce long-standing parameter ambiguities but also introduce into the \ntransfer reaction description the excellent systematic behavior manifested by the HF \ncalculations across extended mass regions [10-12]. This agreement between the \nsystematics of the HF predictions and a range of nuclear size parameters suggests that the \ntheory should also provide a good description of the spatial extent of individual single-\nparticle states.  \nWe thus propose the following consistent three-body analysis of ground-state-to-\nground-state neutron transfer reaction data taking HF theoretical input. We calculate the \ntransfer reaction amplitudes using the Johnson-Soper (JS) adiabatic approximation to the \nneutron, proton and target three-body system [13]. By this means we include the effects \nof the break-up of the deuteron in the field of the target and of the transfer of the neutron \ninto (or out of) the breakup continuum. Formulating the reactions from this three-body \nperspective has the enormous advantage that one needs to specify only (the far better \nunderstood) nucleon-target optical interactions. Additionally, we avoid the ambiguity in \noptical potentials obtained from individual best fits to elastic scattering data, by using \nglobal nucleon optical potential descriptions that can be applied consistently at all the \nrequired incident energies and for all target nuclei. These optical potentials are derived \nfrom the nuclear matter effective nucleon-nucleon interaction of Jeukenne, Lejeune and \nMahaux (JLM) [14]. \n 3\nThe resulting energy- and density-dependent effective interactions are folded with \nthe target one-body densities, using the mid-point local density prescription [15]. These \nrequired densities are taken from Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations based on a Skyrme \nparameterization that offers quantitative agreement with experimental nuclear size \nparameters. Specifically, we use the recent SkX parameter set [9], determined from a \nlarge set of data on spherical nuclei, including nuclei far from stability. The parameter set \naccounts for the binding energy differences of mirror nuclei [10], interaction cross \nsections [11], and nuclear charge distributions [12]. The computed neutron and proton HF \ndensities were used individually in evaluating the isovector contribution to the JLM \noptical potentials. We adopt the conventional scale factors for the computed real and \nimaginary parts of the JLM nucleon optical potentials, \u03bbV=1.0 and \u03bbW = 0.8, found to be \nconsistent with an analysis of data on several systems [15]. \nThe remaining critical ingredients to the reaction calculations are the geometries \nof the potentials used to generate the neutron overlap functions. For comparison \npurposes, in the following we will use two different local potential prescriptions. \nPotential Set I is just a conventional Woods-Saxon potential of fixed radius and \ndiffuseness parameters, r0=1.25 fm and a0=0.65 fm. This geometry has been used \nextensively throughout the literature on single-nucleon transfer. The aforementioned \nagreement of the systematics of the Skyrme SkX HF predictions with nuclear size \nparameters suggests that this theory will also give a good description of individual single-\nparticle states. So, for potential Set II we continue to fix the diffuseness parameter at \na0=0.65 fm, to which the calculations are rather insensitive, but then adjust the radius \nparameter, r0, for each reaction, to reproduce the root mean squared (rms) radius of the \nrelevant transferred neutron orbital, as given by the HF calculation. More precisely, r0 is \nadjusted so that the mean squared radius of the transferred neutron orbital is \u2329r2\u232a = [A\/(A-\n1)] \u2329r2\u232aHF, where \u2329r2\u232aHF is the HF calculation value. This adjustment is carried out using \nthe HF separation energy. This small mass correction factor corrects the fixed potential \ncenter assumption used in the HF approach.  \nThis theoretical guidance on the spatial extension of the neutron bound-state wave \nfunction is critical in our analysis. The sensitivity of the calculated cross-sections, and \nhence the deduced SFs, to this wave function is primarily to its rms radius. As typical we \n 4\nconsider the 40Ca(d,p) reaction at 20 MeV. Based on calculations using a range of binding \npotentials, with 1.2 \u2264 r0 \u2264 1.3 fm, 0.6 \u2264 a0 \u2264 0.7 fm and 0 \u2264 Vso \u2264 6 MeV, that generate \n1f7\/2 states with rms radii in the range 3.8 to 4.1 fm, the changes in the computed SFs are \nreproduced to better than 1.5% by the following finite difference formula, \n        .  \na\n)(a 0.717-\nrms\n(rms) 7.658-  \nSF\n(SF)\n0\n0\u03b4\u03b4\u03b4 =       (1) \nThere is negligible (explicit) dependence on r0 and Vso beyond their effects on the rms \nradius. Thus, changes of 7.7% in a0 [\u03b4(a0)~0.05 fm] and 2.5% in the rms radius [\u03b4(rms) ~ \n0.1 fm] translate into \u03b4(SF) of 5% and 19%, respectively, for this transition.  \nFor the 40-45,47-49Ca isotopes the deduced r0 values decrease monotonically with \nincreasing A, and are 1.343, 1.282, 1.276, 1.270, 1.265, 1.259, 1.250, 1.245, and 1.134 \nfm, respectively. The most significant and rapid changes are at the start of a new sub-\nshell, 1f7\/2 (N=21) and 2p3\/2 (N=29). Using these values and the JLM optical potentials, \nwe place constraints on the spatial extension of the (structural) overlap function and on \nthe (dynamical) nucleon optical potentials. In doing so, we expect to determine more \nconsistently and precisely that part of the neutron overlap function that is sampled within \nthe transfer reaction transition amplitude. We have also constrained all significant bound \nstate and optical potential parameters theoretically. \nThese define the key inputs to the reaction. For both binding potential choices the \ndepths of the central potential wells are adjusted to reproduce the experimental separation \nenergies to ensure the correct asymptotic form of the overlap functions. A spin-orbit \npotential of strength 6 MeV, with the same (central) geometry parameters, r0 and a0, was \nincluded in potential Set II. All calculations treated finite range effects using the local \nenergy approximation (LEA) [16] with the transfer strength (Do2=15006.25 MeV2 fm3) \nand range (\u03b2=0.7457 fm) parameters of the Reid soft-core 3S1-3D1 neutron-proton \ninteraction [17]. Non-locality corrections, with range parameters of 0.85 fm and 0.54 fm \n[18], were included in the proton and deuteron channels, respectively. The transfer \nreaction calculations were carried out using a version of the code TWOFNR [19]. The \nneutron SF was extracted by fitting the theoretical calculations to the first maximum in \nthe measured angular distributions. The errors on the deduced SF are assigned as \ndiscussed in Ref. [20]. \n 5\nBefore we examine a broader range of targets, we first focus on available data for the \n40-45,47-49Ca isotopes. Since 40Ca is doubly magic, with closed proton and neutron sd-\nshells, the additional neutrons in 41-48Ca fill the f7\/2 orbit. These valence neutron \nwavefunctions in the Ca isotopes are expected to be good single particle orbitals. Indeed, \nthe predicted SF values from large-basis shell-model (LB-SM) calculations, which \ninclude configuration mixing, and the independent particle model (IPM), which neglects \nsuch effects, are essentially equal in the calcium isotopes. As most of the (e,e\u0085p) SF \nanalyses are compared to the IPM, we also compare our deduced SFs for the calcium \nisotopes with those of the IPM. For n valence nucleons, each of total angular momentum \nj, the IPM predictions are [21] \nSF(IPM) = n, for n=even;             SF(IPM) = 1-\n12\n1\n+\n\u2212\nj\nn , for n=odd.        (2) \nFor 40-49Ca, these SFs are 4, 1, 2, \u00be, 4, \u00bd, 6, \u00bc, 8 and 1, respectively; the odd\/even effects \narise from pairing. Figure 1 now shows the ratios of the extracted SFs to these SF(IPM) \nas a function of mass number A.  \nThe solid stars in Figure 1 represent the ratios SF(HF)\/SF(IPM) for the calcium \nisotopes. These SF(HF) are the new results of our constrained analysis, using the HF-\ninspired neutron binding potential geometries, Set II, and the JLM nucleon optical \npotentials obtained using the HF densities of the targets. We observe an overall reduction \nin the SF(HF) compared to the IPM values of about 25-30%. The additional data point for \nA=40 (open circle) is the proton SF value, 0.645(50), as deduced from the (e,e\u2032p) analysis \nof Ref. [4].  Within the assigned experimental uncertainties, the neutron SF(HF) and the \nproton SF(e,e\u2032p) for 40Ca agree.  \nFor comparison, we also extract SF values from a conventional adiabatic three-body \nmodel reaction analysis, now using the Chapel Hill (CH89) global phenomenological \nnucleon-target interactions [22] and the standard binding potential geometry, (Set I). The \nopen stars in Fig. 1 show the corresponding SF ratios, SF(conv)\/SF(IPM). The ratios for \nthese latter calculations are close to unity within experimental uncertainties although \nthree odd-A isotopes, 43Ca, 45Ca, and 49Ca are somewhat suppressed. The suppression for \n49Ca may be traced to a sharp increase in the rms radius of the 2p3\/2 orbital in 49Ca (4.59 \nfm), compared to that of the 1f7\/2 orbit (3.99 fm) in neighboring 48Ca, when using the \n 6\nstandard geometry.  However this explanation cannot address the reduction in the SFs for \nthe 43Ca and 45Ca nuclei.  \n The deduced SF(HF) are consistently reduced compared to the SF(conv). The \nreduction of the SF(HF) values comes from both the changes of optical potential and the \nuse of more realistic (larger) neutron-bound state wave-functions. On average, 15% of the \nreduction arises from the use of the JLM potential instead of the CH89 global potential. \nSimilar effects were observed in Ref. [23]. The rms radii of the neutron bound state wave \nfunctions from Set II, based on the Skyrme SkX HF predictions, are also, on average, \nabout 2% larger than the rms radii from Set I, the conventional Woods-Saxon potential of \nfixed radius and diffuseness parameters. This results in further reduction of the SF values \nby about 15%, as was discussed earlier in connection with Eq. (1). The observed \nsuppression is thus a manifestation of both effects. As was stated earlier, we believe that \nthese changes, constrained by the same (HF) theoretical systematics, will better \ndetermine the all-important overlap of the distorted waves and bound state wave \nfunctions at the nuclear surface. \nThe Ca isotope SF(conv) values are a subset of a recent large-scale survey of 80 \nnuclei, studied via the (p,d) and (d,p) transfer reactions [8,20]. In the survey, it was \nshown that within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, most extracted SF(conv) \nvalues, like those for the Ca isotopes, agreed with the predictions of the large-basis shell-\nmodel (LB-SM). To examine whether or not the reductions in the deduced SF(HF) are \nlimited to the calcium isotopes, we have applied the same HF-constrained analysis to a \nselection of the 80 nuclei studied in Ref. [8, 20]. As the HF is less appropriate for the \ndescription of single-particle configurations of very light systems, we limit the analysis to \nA>11. Additionally, beyond the calcium isotopes, the IPM does not take proper account \nof configuration mixing effects, so we now compare the extracted SF(HF) to large-basis \nshell model SF(LB-SM) predictions which are calculated with the code OXBASH [24]. \nThese ratios are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure 2, as a function of the difference \nbetween the neutron and proton separation energies in the nuclei concerned, \u2206S (\u2206S=Sn-\nSp for neutron SF and \u2206S=Sp-Sn for proton SF). Here, \u2206S is the difference of the neutron \nand proton Fermi surfaces. For clarity, only those points with an overall uncertainty of \nless than 25% are included. Data with uncertainties much larger than 20% (the random \n 7\nerror assigned to each measurement) have quality control problems in the evaluation. In \nsuch case, there is either (a) no second measurement to corroborate the validity of a data \nset or (b) the standard deviations of the measurements used to extract the SF values are \nlarger than 25%. For the (statistically most significant) cases presented, we note once \nagain an overall SF(HF) reduction of order 30% compared to the SF(conv) of Ref. [8, \n20], but with significant residual fluctuations between the values for different nuclei. For \nthe nuclei investigated here, there is no evident dependence of the observed reduction \nfactors on \u2206Sp. Limiting the observations to the calcium isotopes (the solid stars in Fig. \n2), which span neutron-proton separation energy differences from \u201311.3 MeV (49Ca) to \n7.3 MeV (40Ca), one draws the same conclusion.  \n The open circles in Figure 2 are the corresponding ratios of the proton ground \nstate SF for 7Li, 12C, 16O, 30Si, 31P, 40Ca, 48Ca, 51V, 90Zr, and 208Pb (as listed in Table 1), \nstudied with the (e,e\u2032p) reaction [4, 25]. Similarly, the solid triangles show the ratios of \nthe deduced SF to SF(LB-SM) values from both exclusive and inclusive studies of \nintermediate energy nucleon knockout reactions. Neutron (proton) knockout values are \nshown as inverted (upright) triangles (and listed in Table 1). These include, at the \nextremes of the |Sn-Sp| scale, 15C [26], 22O [27], 34Ar [28], and 46Ar [29], while the values \nfor 8B, 9C [30], 32Ar [27], 12C, 16O [5], and 57Ni [31] overlap the \u2206S values of both the \ntransfer and the (e,e\u2032p) analyses. In the case of the inclusive knockout reaction analysis of \nRef. [5] and [31], effective neutron and proton removal energies were used, obtained by \nweighting the physical separation energies to each final state by the corresponding cross-\nsections. The suppression with respect to the SF(LB-SM) is similar from the three \ndifferent reactions within the \u2206S region in which they overlap.  A dependence of the \nsuppression on \u2206S is indicated by the nucleon-knockout data that extend the data set into \nregions of significant neutron and proton asymmetry. \n In summary, we have presented a consistent analysis of ground-state-to-ground-\nstate single neutron transfer reaction data using a three-body reaction model that \nconstrains the nucleon bound state and nucleon-target optical potential geometries using \nmodern Hartree-Fock calculations. The methodology removes significant, long-standing \npotential parameter ambiguities from the reaction analysis through the use of theoretical \ndensities and single-particle orbital rms radii. In so doing, we believe that we have \n 8\ndefined more precisely that fraction of the neutron overlap function that is sampled in the \ntransfer reaction amplitudes. The deduced spectroscopic factors SF(HF) for the calcium \nisotopes, and more generally for other systems, show a reduction of ~30% compared to \nboth shell-model values and the SF(conv) deduced using a global optical potential and a \nconventional, fixed bound state potential geometry. There is no evidence that the \nreduction factor is correlated with the nucleon separation energy difference, \u2206S, over the \nrange of values available to this (ground state) transfer analysis. This observation, and the \nobserved suppression factor of about 70%, are consistent with deduced spectroscopic \nstrengths for neutrons and protons from intermediate energy nucleon knockout reactions, \nand for protons from (e,e\u2032p) reactions on well-bound nuclei. \n \nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. \nPHY-01-10253, No. PHY-02-44453 and by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences \nResearch Council (EPSRC) under Grant No. EP\/D003628.  \n \nReferences:  \n[1] M.G.

J\u03c0 is the angular momentum and parity of the \ntransferred nucleon. For the (p,d), (d,p) [8, 20] and (e,e\u2032p) [4, 25] reactions, only ground \nstate SFs are extracted. The theoretical SF values are obtained from the large-basis shell-\nmodel code, OXBASH [5,20,24]. For the neutron and proton knockout reactions [26-31], \nthe deduced quantities are the cross section reduction factors, Rs, which are equivalent to \nSF(expt)\/SF(LB-SM). \n(p,d) (p,d) j\u03c0 Sn-Sp SF (Expt) SF (LB-SM) SF\/SF(LB-SM) \n12B 1\/2- -10.72 0.40 \u00b1 0.06 0.83 0.48 \u00b1 0.07 \n12C   3\/2- 2.75 2.16 \u00b1 0.25 2.85 0.76 \u00b1 0.09 \n13C 1\/2- -12.58 0.54 \u00b1 0.07 0.61 0.88 \u00b1 0.12 \n 10\n14C 1\/2- -12.65 1.07 \u00b1 0.22 1.73 0.62 \u00b1 0.12 \n14N 1\/2- 3.00 0.48 \u00b1 0.08 0.69 0.69 \u00b1 0.11 \n15N 1\/2- 0.62 0.93 \u00b1 0.15 1.46 0.64 \u00b1 0.10 \n16O 1\/2- 3.53 1.48 \u00b1 0.16 2.00 0.74 \u00b1 0.08 \n17O 5\/2+ -9.64 0.75 \u00b1 0.10 1.00 0.75 \u00b1 0.10 \n18O 5\/2+ -7.90 1.46 \u00b1 0.17 1.58 0.92 \u00b1 0.11 \n19O 5\/2+ -13.12 0.35 \u00b1 0.05 0.69 0.51 \u00b1 0.07 \n25Mg 5\/2+ -4.73 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 0.34 0.61 \u00b1 0.07 \n26Mg 5\/2+ -3.06 1.83 \u00b1 0.38 2.51 0.73 \u00b1 0.15 \n27Al 5\/2+ 4.79 0.93 \u00b1 0.13 1.10 0.84 \u00b1 0.12 \n28Al 1\/2+ -1.82 0.57 \u00b1 0.08 0.60 0.95 \u00b1 0.14 \n30Si 1\/2+ -2.90 0.55 \u00b1 0.07 0.82 0.67 \u00b1 0.08 \n31Si 3\/2+ -7.78 0.42 \u00b1 0.07 0.58 0.72 \u00b1 0.11 \n32P 1\/2+ -0.71 0.39 \u00b1 0.07 0.60 0.65 \u00b1 0.11 \n34S 3\/2+ 0.54 1.11 \u00b1 0.27 1.83 0.61 \u00b1 0.15 \n37Ar 3\/2+ 0.08 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 0.36 0.74 \u00b1 0.10 \n40Ca  3\/2+ 7.31 3.20 \u00b1 0.46 4.00 0.80 \u00b1 0.11 \n41Ca 7\/2- -0.53 0.73 \u00b1 0.04 1.00 0.73 \u00b1 0.04 \n42Ca 7\/2- 1.20 1.31 \u00b1 0.12 1.81 0.72 \u00b1 0.06 \n43Ca 7\/2- -2.75 0.44 \u00b1 0.05 0.75 0.59 \u00b1 0.07 \n45Ca 7\/2- -4.88 0.26 \u00b1 0.04 0.50 0.52 \u00b1 0.07 \n47Ca 7\/2- -6.93 0.19 \u00b1 0.03 0.26 0.74 \u00b1 0.10 \n48Ca 7\/2- -5.86 5.41 \u00b1 1.05 7.38 0.73 \u00b1 0.14 \n49Ca 3\/2- -11.30 0.74 \u00b1 0.08 0.92 0.81 \u00b1 0.08 \n46Ti 7\/2- 2.85 1.61 \u00b1 0.23 2.58 0.62 \u00b1 0.09 \n(e,e'p) j\u03c0 Sp-Sn SF (Expt) SF (LB-SM) SF\/SF(LB-SM) \n7Li 3\/2- 2.73 0.42 \u00b1 0.04 0.67 0.63 \u00b1 0.06 \n12C   3\/2- -2.75 1.72 \u00b1 0.11 2.85 0.60 \u00b1 0.04 \n16O 1\/2- -3.53 1.27 \u00b1 0.13  2.00 0.64 \u00b1 0.07 \n30Si  5\/2+ 2.90 2.21 \u00b1 0.20 3.80 0.58 \u00b1 0.05 \n31P 0+ -5.01 0.40 \u00b1 0.03 0.58 0.68 \u00b1 0.04 \n40Ca  3\/2+ -7.3 2.58 \u00b1 0.19 4.00 0.65 \u00b1 0.05 \n48Ca 1\/2+ 5.86 1.07 \u00b1 0.07 1.98 0.54 \u00b1 0.04 \n51V   7\/2- -2.99 0.37 \u00b1 0.03 0.75 0.49 \u00b1 0.04 \n90Zr 1\/2- -3.62 0.72 \u00b1 0.07 1.28 0.56 \u00b1 0.05 \n208Pb  1\/2+ 0.63 0.98 \u00b1 0.09 2.00 0.49 \u00b1 0.05 \nn-knockout j\u03c0 Sn-Sp SF (Expt) SF (LB-SM) Rs \n12C incl 3.07  - 0.49 \u00b1 0.02 \n15C 1\/2+ -19.86  0.98 0.96 \u00b1 0.04 \n16O incl 7.64  - 0.56 \u00b1 0.03 \n22O 5\/2+ -16.39  5.22 0.70 \u00b1 0.06 \n32Ar 5\/2+ 19.20  4.12 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 \n34Ar incl 13.94  - 0.41 \u00b1 0.07  \n46Ar   7\/2- -10.63  5.41 0.85 \u00b1 0.12 \n 11\n57Ni incl 5.97  - 0.51 \u00b1 0.02 \np-knockout j\u03c0 Sp-Sn SF (Expt) SF (LB-SM) Rs \n8B incl -12.82  -  0.86 \u00b1 0.07 \n9C 3\/2- -12.96  0.94 0.82 \u00b1 0.06 \n12C incl -2.43  -  0.53 \u00b1 0.02 \n16O incl 0.68  -  0.68 \u00b10.04\n \n \n \nFigure 1:  (Color online) Ratios of the experimentally deduced spectroscopic factors to \nthose of the independent particle shell-model SF(IPM) for the calcium isotopic chain. \nThe open symbols, from SF(conv), result from the use of conventional, three-body \nadiabatic model calculations using the Chapel Hill global nucleon optical potentials and a \nfixed neutron bound-state geometry (Set I) [5].
