Introduction\n[2] Baseline Inferences for Fennoscandian Rebound\nObservations Sea Level and Tectonics (BIFROST)\n[BIFROST Project, 1996] is a project initiated in 1993 to\ndirectly measure the present-day, three-dimensional (3-D)\ncrustal deformation in Fennoscandia. A dense array of\ncontinuously operating GPS (Global Positioning System)\nreceivers was deployed between 1993 and 1997 to achieve\nthis objective. The BIFROST GPS network is composed\nof two subnetworks, the Swedish SWEPOS\nTM\nnetwork\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, B02412, doi:10.1029\/2003JB002619, 2004\n1Department of Earth Sciences, University of Durham, Durham, UK.\n2Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada.\n3Onsala Space Observatory, Chalmers University of Technology,\nOnsala, Sweden.\n4Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachu-\nsetts, USA.\n5Finnish Geodetic Institute, Masala, Finland.\n6Institute of Geodesy, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo,\nFinland.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JB002619$09.00\nB02412 1 of 18\n(21 receivers) and the Finnish FinnRef\nTM\nnetwork (12 re-\nceivers) which, together, provide a relatively uniform and\ncomplete spatial sampling of crustal motion in Sweden and\nFinland (see Figure 1a for site locations).\n[3] The companion paper by Johansson et al. [2002]\n(hereinafter referred to as paper 1) focused on data analysis\nprocedures adopted to obtain the geodetic estimates of crustal\ndeformation and on the primary sources of error associated\nwith the GPS data analysis. The site velocities resulting from\nthe BIFROST standard solution (see paper 1) are plotted in\nFigures 1b and 1c. The vertical rates (Figure 1b) map into a\nbroad, ellipsoidal region of uplift with an axis of symmetry\nlying approximately southwest to northeast. The maximum,\nsite-specific, rate of 11.2 mm\/yr is recorded at Umea\u00a8. The\nhorizontal deformation field is characterized by motions\ndirected outward from the zone of maximum crustal uplift.\nThe amplitude of these horizontal motions exceeds 2 mm\/yr\nat several sites (e.g., Troms\u00f8, Arjeplog).\n[4] The 3-D crustal velocities estimated from the\nBIFROST network exhibit geometries that are consistent\nwith numerical models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)\n[e.g., James and Lambert, 1993; Mitrovica et al., 1994b]. A\npreliminary modeling analysis in paper 1 showed that pre-\ndictions based on a single ice-Earth model pair tuned to fit a\nregional sea level database yields a good fit to the BIFROST\nresults, suggesting that GIA is the dominant contribution to\nthe observed signal. This was confirmed by Milne et al.\n[2001], who provided an overview of the application of\nBIFROST constraints to the problems of inferring mantle\nviscosity, estimating ongoing regional sea level rise and\nbounding neotectonic motions in Fennoscandia.\n[5] Models of the GIA process in Fennoscandia have\ntraditionally been constrained using relative sea level obser-\nvations obtained from sea level markers within the geolog-\nical record or from the regional tide gauge network. These\nsea level data have been used in a large number of analyses\nto infer GIA model parameters relating to subsurface\nviscosity structure [e.g., Haskell, 1935; Veining Meinesz,\n1937; McConnell, 1968; Wolf, 1987; Fjeldskaar, 1994;\nMitrovica, 1996; Lambeck et al., 1998a; Davis et al.,\n1999; Wieczerkowski et al., 1999] and the deglaciation\nhistory of the most recent Fennoscandian ice sheet [e.g.,\nTushingham and Peltier, 1991; Lambeck et al., 1998a].\nUnfortunately, while the Fennoscandian database of sea\nlevel observations is relatively large, it remains insufficient\nto uniquely constrain either the loading history or the Earth\nFigure 1. (a) Map showing the locations of 34 GPS receiver sites in the BIFROST GPS network. The\nnetwork comprises 21 SWEPOS\nTM stations (triangles) and 12 FinnRefTM stations (circles). Data from\nthe IGS (International GPS Service) site Troms\u00f8 (diamond) are also employed in the analysis.\nNote that the sites are distributed uniformly over most of Sweden and Finland. (b) Contour map\nof the present-day vertical velocity field. The locations of the GPS sites are shown by grey circles\nand the site-specific 1s uncertainty is superimposed at each location (error scale at top). (c) The\npresent-day horizontal velocity determined for each site. The 1s error ellipses are shown (scale\nvector at bottom). Site locations are marked by grey circles. The observational errors shown are\nscaled values of the formal uncertainties determined for each site. The scaling factor is computed\nas part of the GPS data processing analysis to quantify the contribution of a number of potential\nerror sources (see paper 1). It is important to note that the errors shown in Figures 1b and 1c are\nestimates of the true uncertainty [see, e.g., Ma\u00a8kinen et al., 2003; Scherneck et al., 2003].\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n2 of 18\nB02412\nmodel for the region or, in fact, to completely separate the\nsensitivities of the observations to these two fundamental\ninputs to the GIA problem.\n[6] These obstacles are common to all GIA analyses, and\nefforts to overcome them involve one of two approaches.\nFirst, one can seek parameterizations of the data that exhibit\na reduced sensitivity to the uncertain ice history [e.g.,\nMcConnell, 1968; Nakada and Lambeck, 1989; Mitrovica\nand Peltier, 1993]. Second, one can introduce new data\ntypes with complementary sensitivities. In regards to GIA\nanalysis within Fennoscandia, the BIFROST data sets\nprovide a novel route toward the latter. For example, a\nkey limitation of sea level data, both geological and tide\ngauge, is their relatively poor spatial distribution [see, e.g.,\nLambeck et al., 1998a, Figure 20]; in particular, these data\nare confined to coastal regions and so provide a relatively\nsparse sampling of the region of uplift. The BIFROST data,\nin contrast, provide an improved spatial coverage that more\nuniformly samples the Fennoscandian deformation field. In\naddition, while sea level data constrain only the vertical\ncomponent of GIA, the GPS network yields estimates of the\nfull 3-D deformation field. The horizontal component of\nGIA-induced deformation has been shown to have sensitiv-\nities to variations in the Earth model and ice history that are\ndistinct from those of the vertical component [Mitrovica et\nal., 1994a, 1994b].\n[7] The present study is motivated by the unique con-\nstraints on GIA models provided by the BIFROST network,\nand our goal is to revisit, in detail, the \u2018\u2018excellent fit\u2019\u2019 to the\nGPS data described in previous numerical GIA studies. We\nbegin by decomposing forward analyses of the present-day\nFennoscandian deformation field into contributions associ-\nated, for example, with ice and ocean loading, rotational\neffects, etc., in order to clarify the physics of the GIA\nresponse in this region. We next explore the potential of the\nBIFROST data to constrain models of the GIA process by\nconsidering predictions based on forward analyses of the\nBIFROST data involving two regional ice models and a\nlarge sequence of Earth models distinguished on the basis of\nthe thickness of the (elastic) lithosphere and the (assumed\nconstant) viscosity within either the upper or lower mantle.\nForward analyses are a relatively crude method for explor-\ning constraints on Earth structure provided by the GPS\nestimates of 3-D crustal velocity. Accordingly, we complete\nthe paper by providing the first multilayer formal inversion\nof the BIFROST data. The primary goal of the inversion is\nto generate estimates of the detailed, depth-dependent\nresolving power of the GPS data.\n2. Forward Model\n[8] In general, numerical models of the GIA process\nrequire two inputs: A representation of the GIA forcing\nand a rheological model of the solid Earth that governs the\nresponse to the forcing. Following the vast majority of\nprevious GIA studies, we adopt a Maxwell viscoelastic\nrheology in our modeling. The extent to which a simple\nlinear rheology of the Maxwell type is valid for the Earth\u2019s\nmantle on GIA timescales remains a matter of ongoing\ndiscussion [e.g., Karato and Wu, 1993; Wu, 1999]. How-\never, there is also broad consensus that the Maxwell\nviscoelastic rheology has proven to be the simplest model\nthat can provide acceptable fits to a variety of GIA data\ntypes.\n[9] The Earth models we adopt are spherically symmetric\n(i.e., physical properties are invariant with longitude and\nlatitude), and self-gravitating. The models are compressible\nin the elastic limit and incompressible in the (long time-\nscale) fluid limit (see Wu and Peltier [1982] for complete\ndetails). The elastic and density structure, which is the same\nfor each model, of the models has a depth discretization of\n25 km throughout the mantle and is taken from the seismic\nmodel PREM [Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981]. The radial\nprofile of viscosity, which is more crudely depth parame-\nterized into three layers, is a free parameter of the modeling\n(see section 3).\n[10] Computing the response of such an Earth model to a\nforcing that includes a surface (ice plus ocean) mass load\nand perturbations in the rotational state is a relatively\ncomplex undertaking [e.g., see Peltier, 1974; Mitrovica et\nal., 1994a; Milne et al., 1999; Mitrovica et al., 2001]. The\nmain elements of the mathematical formalism are briefly\ndescribed in Appendix A. In the following, we outline the\ngeneral steps in the calculation, paying particular attention\nto new developments that are relevant to results described in\nsection 3.\n[11] Our calculation of present-day 3-D crustal motions\nproceeds as follows. First, with the viscoelastic Earth model\nspecified, we compute all the parameters defining the Love\nnumbers (equations (A1) to (A4)), using the approach\nspecified by Peltier [1974] and Wu [1978]. Second, for a\ngiven model of the late Pleistocene ice history we solve the\nsea level equation recently derived by Milne [1998] and\nMilne et al. [1999]. The new sea level theory incorporates a\nseries of improvements to the traditional approach described\nby Farrell and Clark [1976], including a revised treatment\nof the sea level response in the vicinity of an evolving\nocean-continent margin and the incorporation of consistent\nGIA-induced perturbations to the model Earth\u2019s rotation\nvector. This sea level equation provides, on output, the\nspherical harmonic decomposition of the ocean load, and\nthus at this stage the total surface mass load as a function of\ntime, L\u2018,m(t) in equations (A8) and (A9), is completely\nspecified. A second output of the theory is a time-dependent\nperturbation in the rotation vector.\n[12] Perturbations to the rotation vector are computed\nwithin the sea level theory by solving a linearized version\nof the Euler equation [e.g., Sabadini et al., 1982; Wu and\nPeltier, 1984; Mitrovica and Milne, 1998; Mitrovica et al.,\n2001]. Expressions required to map these perturbations into\nspherical harmonic coefficients of the change in the rota-\ntional potential, L\u2018,m(t) in equations (A8) and (A9), are given\nby Mitrovica and Milne [1998] and Mitrovica et al. [2001].\nTo produce accurate predictions of the present rate of change\nof the rotation vector, and the associated rotational potential,\nthis aspect of the computation is performed over seven full\nglacial cycles [e.g., Sabadini and Vermeersen, 1997]. The\nresulting time series,L\u2018,m(t), provides the final component of\nthe GIA-forcing required in our expressions (A8) and (A9)\nthat give the spherical harmonic coefficients of the 3-D\ncrustal displacement response.\n[13] The computation of 3-D crustal motions is, at this\nstage, straightforward. The Love number parameters (equa-\ntions (A1)\u2013(A4)) are used to establish the impulse response\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n3 of 18\nB02412\nof the Earth model and these, together with the spherical\nharmonic coefficients of the surface mass load, L\u2018,m, and\nrotational potential, L\u2018,m, are applied to equations (A8) and\n(A9). Solving these equations yields, following equations\n(A5) and (A6), the coefficients in the spectral decomposi-\ntions of the vertical and horizontal components of the\ncrustal motion, respectively.\n3. Modeling Results\n3.1. Forward Analysis\n[14] In previous work we were concerned solely with the\nability of the numerical predictions to fit the BIFROST\nestimates of 3-D deformation in Fennoscandia. To begin this\nsection we decompose a specific prediction that provides a\ngood fit to these data into the contributions associated with\neach of the three GIA forcings (ice load, ocean load, and\nrotational potential). The three-layer radial viscosity model\nincludes a top layer of thickness 96 km in which the\nviscosity is set to very large values in order to simulate an\nelastic lithosphere. The viscosity in the upper mantle,\nextending from the base of the lithosphere to the 670 km\nseismic discontinuity, is 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, and the viscosity\nwithin the lower mantle, the region from 670 km to the\ntop of the core, is set to 5 \u0001 1021 Pa s. This viscosity\nmodel provides a good fit to the BIFROST data [e.g., Milne\net al., 2001]; it is also compatible with a number of\nrecent inferences, based on various parameterizations of\nFennoscandian sea level data, which are relatively insensi-\ntive to details of the ice sheet history [Mitrovica, 1996;\nWieczerkowski et al., 1999].\n[15] In regard to a global ice model, we adopt the ICE-3G\nhistory of Tushingham and Peltier [1991] but replace the\nFennoscandian and Barents Sea component of this history\nwith the regional model proposed by Lambeck et al. [1998a]\n(hereafter referred to as the LSJ model). The latter has been\nshown to provide a good fit to the Fennoscandian database\nof relative sea level histories [Lambeck et al., 1998a,\n1998b]. The complementary ocean load is computed by\nsolving several versions of the so-called sea level equation\n(see below); in all cases, the sea level response is computed\nby employing the pseudospectral technique [Mitrovica and\nPeltier, 1991; Milne et al., 1999] with a spherical harmonic\ntruncation at degree and order 256.\n[16] Figure 2 shows a series of predictions of radial crustal\nvelocity. Figure 2a shows the total response generated using\nthe ice history and Earth model specified above, together\nwith an ocean load computed using the nonrotating form of\nthe new sea level formalism derived by Milne [1998] and\nMilne et al. [1999]. In Figures 2b and 2c this signal is\ndecomposed into the ice and ocean load signals, respectively.\nThe total signal (Figure 2a) peaks at 10\u201311 mm\/yr near the\nsites Skelleftea\u00a8 and Umea\u00a8. It is clear that the ice loading\ndominates the magnitude and geometry of the present-day\nradial deformation response. The local ocean load, in com-\nparison, contributes 10\u201320% of the total signal with peak\namplitudes that are localized, not surprisingly, in the Gulf of\nBothnia. The magnitude of the ocean-load-induced signal\nvaries from 0.05 to 1.2 mm\/yr at the GPS receiver locations.\nGiven that the uncertainties in the vertical rates are generally\nsubmillimeters per year (see Figure 1 and paper 1) and that\nthese errors will continue to improve as the GPS time series\nare extended, the signal from the ocean load, though rela-\ntively small, is certainly significant.\n[17] The sea level theory described by Milne [1998]\nincorporates, among other things, a significant improvement\nin the treatment of the water load in the vicinity of regions\nvacated by ablating ice relative to the original equation\nderived by Farrell and Clark [1976]. This improvement is\nillustrated in Figure 3 for the period in which ice retreats\nfrom the Gulf of Bothnia.\n[18] Figure 3 (left) shows the ice thickness in three\nsnapshots from 11.6 to 8.8 ka, during which time the\nFennoscandian region becomes ice free. Figure 3 (middle)\nshows the variation in the ocean load predicted using the\nnew sea level theory of Milne [1998]. As an example,\nFigure 2. Forward predictions of the radial component of\npresent-day crustal velocity due to different components of\nthe GIA surface loading: (a) both ice and ocean components;\n(b) ice component only; (c) ocean component only; and\n(d) ocean component predicted by solving the original sea\nlevel equation of Farrell and Clark [1976]. GPS receiver\nlocations are indicated in accordance with Figure 1a.\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n4 of 18\nB02412\nFigure 3. Components of the regional surface load during the last stages of deglaciation. (left) Ice\nthickness at the times (a) 11.6, (b) 10.2, and (c) 8.8 ka. These times correspond to the calibrated 14C\ntimescale. (middle and right) Predicted ocean load at the corresponding time steps predicted via the\nrevised [Milne et al., 1999] and original [Farrell and Clark, 1976] sea level equations, respectively. In\nFigure 3 (middle and right) the areas with light grey shading denote regions that are either ice covered or\nabove contemporaneous sea level. See color version of this figure at back of this issue.\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n5 of 18\nB02412\nFigure 3b represents the ocean load change predicted over\nthe preceding time step (from 11.6 to 10.2 ka), and so on.\nBetween 11.6 and 10.2 ka, a large section of the gulf\nbecomes ice free (Figure 3, left), and the new sea level\ntheory correctly predicts an inundation of water into this\nregion. The color contours on Figure 3 indicate that inun-\ndation extends over a broad swath of Finland and a portion\nof Sweden, indicating that these areas were below sea level\n(due to the crustal lowering caused by the ice load) at the\ntime of ice retreat. The amplitude of the inundation reaches\nin excess of 400 m in the central portion of the gulf. Over\nthe same period, the Baltic Sea to the south experiences a\nreduction in the ocean load of amplitude tens of meters.\nThis region became ice free at an earlier stage in the model;\nhence, from 11.6 to 10.2 ka the predicted reduction in ocean\nload is primarily a consequence of continuing postglacial\nuplift of the local crust. In the next time slice, from 10.2 to\n8.8 ka, the ice sheet disappears, and the northern tip of the\nGulf of Bothnia is finally exposed. The corresponding\nocean load prediction (Figures 3c, middle) shows an influx\nof water into this small area of \u0003200 m amplitude. During\nthe same period the remainder of gulf (i.e., the region that\nbecame ice free in the penultimate time step) experiences a\nsignificant reduction in the ocean load. This reduction is\nlargely due to the postglacial uplift of the region; however,\nthere is also a significant contribution from the fall in the\nocean surface associated with the decreasing gravitational\nattraction of the ablating ice mass.\n[19] The inundation of water into a region vacated by\nablating ice is governed by the total distance between the\ngeoid and solid surfaces in the region exposed by the ice\nretreat. In traditional postglacial sea level theory, the local\nwater load is governed not by the total distance between the\ngeoid and solid surfaces, but rather by changes in the height\nof each of these surfaces over the previous time step; hence\nthe inundation process cannot be modeled. To illustrate this,\nFigure 3 (right) shows a sequence of predictions analogous\nto Figure 3 (middle), with the exception that the traditional\ntheory for ocean load changes is applied. In this case,\nregions subject to recent ice retreat do not show an influx\nof water load. Instead, both crustal uplift and the changing\ngravitational attraction of the ablating ice mass lead to a\nreduction in the distance between the geoid and solid\nsurfaces and thus a reduction in the local ocean load. Note\nthat the two theories (Figures 3, middle, and 3, right) show\nrelatively consistent predictions in regions that are not\nvacated by ice in the most recent time step.\n[20] The results in Figure 3 indicate that the original sea\nlevel theory yields a considerably larger negative water load\nfor the region compared to the revised theory. Figure 2d\nshows the ocean load signal in radial crustal velocity\npredicted on the basis of the original sea level equation.\nThe predicted uplift signal is 2\u20133 times greater than that\npredicted using the revised theory in the vicinity of the Gulf\nof Bothnia (see Figure 2c). The error incurred by adopting\nthe original sea level theory is as high as 1.6 mm\/yr at the\nBIFROST sites, a discrepancy which exceeds the typical\nobservational error.\n[21] Figure 4 shows results that are analogous to those in\nFigure 2, with the exception that we now treat the horizontal\ndeformation field. The total predicted signal (Figure 4a)\ndisplays the characteristic pattern of divergent motion\ncentered near the location of the peak present-day uplift\n(and peak ice height at Last Glacial Maximum). This\nprediction is in accord with the general form of the\nobservations (Figure 1c). The asymmetry in the predicted\ndeformation pattern is largely a result of the deformation\nassociated with the deglaciation of the distant Laurentide ice\ncomplex [Mitrovica et al., 1994b]. As in Figure 2, the ice-\nload-induced signal generally dominates the total field. An\nexception to this rule is evident in southern Finland, where\nthe magnitude of the ocean load signal is comparable to the\nhorizontal motions produced by the ice loading. The error\nincurred by adopting the traditional sea level theory is most\npronounced in the same region.\n[22] Next we focus on deformation driven by GIA-in-\nduced perturbations in Earth rotation. The geometry of the\nperturbation to the centrifugal potential is described (to\nbetter than \u00031%) by a degree 2 order one surface spherical\nharmonic [e.g., Han and Wahr, 1989; Mitrovica et al.,\n2001]. The orientation of this potential forcing is governed\nby the GIA-induced polar wander path during the postgla-\ncial period, which lies, approximately, on the great circle\nFigure 4. Analogous to the predictions shown in Figure 2\nexcept that the present-day horizontal deformation rate field\nis shown. The GPS site locations are not shown. The scale\nvector is shown at the bottom left.\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n6 of 18\nB02412\n(74\u0004W, 106\u0004E) [Mitrovica et al., 2001]. Specifically, the\nperturbing rotational potential induced by this polar motion\nis a maximum along this great circle at midlatitudes, with\nnodes along the equator, the poles, and along the great circle\nof longitude oriented 90\u0004 east or west of the pole path.\n[23] The radial component of the rotation-induced defor-\nmation field shares the same spatial signature as the rota-\ntional potential itself (see equations (A5) and (A8)). Thus\nthe rotation-induced signal in Fennoscandia is not signifi-\ncant since this region is located approximately 90\u0004 east of\nthe great circle defined by the polar wander path. In\ncontrast, the horizontal deformation field has a geometry\ndefined by the (spatial) gradient of the rotational potential\n(see equations (A6) and (A9)). Accordingly, the horizontal\ndeformation field is relatively large in Fennoscandia [see\nalso Mitrovica et al., 2001]. In Figure 5 we decompose the\ntotal predicted horizontal velocity (Figure 5a) into the signal\nassociated with a nonrotating Earth (Figure 5b, which is\nidentical to Figure 4a) and the signal associated with\nrotation. The latter signal is relatively uniform within\nFennoscandia, which reflects the broad spatial scale of the\nrotation signal, and it is directed west to east with a\nmagnitude of \u00030.4 mm\/yr. It is clear that rotational effects\nhave a significant impact on the predicted deformation\npattern; for example, these effects act to counter the asym-\nmetry introduced in Figure 5b from Laurentide deglaciation.\nIn any event, the magnitude of the rotation signal exceeds\nthe observational error (see Figure 1 and paper 1).\n[24] The postglacial rebound literature includes a number\nof inferences of ice history and Earth model pairings based\non analyses of sea level data. In Figure 6 we compare results\nof two such pairings with the intent to examine the\nsensitivity of the predictions to different ice histories as\nwell as to determine which of these two published models\nprovides the best fit to the data. In Figure 6a (top) we replot\nthe prediction of present-day radial crustal velocity based\non the Fennoscandian ice history of Lambeck et al. [1998a]\nand the Earth model specified above. This model produces\nan uplift pattern that reaches a maximum of 10.2 mm\/yr\nbetween the sites Umea\u00a8 and Skelleftea\u00a8. The geometry of the\nvelocity field reflects the spatial extent and the deglaciation\nhistory of the ice model: specifically, the LSJ model\nproduces an oval-shaped pattern with the long axis trending,\napproximately, north-northeast to south-southwest. The\nresults shown in Figure 6a (bottom) were generated using\nthe ICE-3G model [Tushingham and Peltier, 1991] and the\nEarth model associated with this ice history; a lithospheric\nthickness of 120 km, upper mantle viscosity of 1021 Pa s,\nand a lower mantle viscosity of 2 \u0001 1021 Pa s (this ice-Earth\nmodel combination is hereinafter referred to as TP). The\nuplift pattern predicted by the TP model is distinct from the\nLSJ-based calculation: the center of uplift is located further\nto the east, and the signal displays an axis of symmetry\nthat is aligned approximately northeast to southwest,\nwith the region of uplift broadening toward the northeast.\nThe maximum uplift rate for this ice-Earth model pair is\n11.1 mm\/yr.\n[25] The results shown in Figure 6b are identical to those\nshown in Figure 6a, with the exception that the plotted\nfields are based only on the model results evaluated at the\nset of BIFROST station locations. These images can be\ncompared directly to the observations (Figure 1b). In\nFigure 5. Predictions of the present-day horizontal crustal velocity field due to (a) both the GIA surface\nmass loading and the rotational potential, (b) the surface mass load only, and (c) the rotational potential\nonly.

The greatest misfit between the\nobservations and the LSJ model is apparent in the northeast\nsection of the plotted region (Figure 6c, top), where the\nobserved radial rates are underpredicted. However, note that\nthe observations in this region exhibit the largest uncertainty.\nThe TP model produces uplift contours that are oriented\nmore east-west than north-south and so it does not, in\nFigure 6.

These qualitative comments are sup-\nported by the normalized c2 misfit computed for these\nmodels: 5.94 and 10.3 for the LSJ and TP models, respec-\ntively. The c2 values are computed by evaluating the\nobserved rate minus the predicted rate divided by the\nobserved error at each site, squaring this value and then\nsumming the contributions for each site. This sum is then\nnormalized by the number of observations minus one.\n[26] Figure 7 shows an analogous plot of the predicted\nhorizontal rates. Once again, the patterns of present-day\nhorizontal velocity generated for the two models are distinct.\nThese differences aremost apparent in the lower section of the\nmap. For example, the TP model produces larger southward\nmotion in southern Finland and southern Sweden. Compar-\nison of the predictions in Figure 7b with the observations\n(Figure 1c) indicates that the latter is better matched by the\nLSJ model (see also column Figure 7c). Thec2 values for the\nLSJ and TP models are 16.8 and 30.6, respectively.\n[27] It is interesting to note that the c2 values for the fits\nto the horizontal rates are \u00033 times larger than those for the\nvertical rates. As discussed previously by Milne et al.\n[2001], this could be a result of limitations in the forward\nmodel due to, for example, a simplified 1-D Earth structure\nFigure 7. As in Figure 6, except that results for horizontal rates are shown. The vector magnitude scale\nis shown at bottom left.\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n9 of 18\nB02412\nor inaccuracies in the adopted ice model. These limitations\nhave been shown to impact the predictions of horizontal\nrates more so than vertical rates [Mitrovica et al., 1994b;\nWahr and Davis, 2002]. With regard to the suggestion of\nuncertainties in the ice model, it is important to note that\nboth of the ice models we have adopted were constrained\nusing observations of relative sea level changes, which are\ndirectly affected by vertical crustal motion but are indepen-\ndent of horizontal motion. This suggests that inaccuracies in\nthe ice models may be an important source of this variation\nin the c2 values. Of course, the poorer fit to the horizontal\nrates could also be attributed to an underestimation of the\ntrue uncertainty in the horizontal rates.\n[28] We next present the results of a detailed forward\nmodeling analysis based on the LSJ ice history. In partic-\nular, we have predicted the Fennoscandian 3-D crustal\ndeformation using this history and a large suite of Earth\nmodels in which the lithospheric thickness, upper mantle\nviscosity (nUM) and lower mantle viscosity (nLM) were\nvaried over the ranges shown in Figure 8. For each of these\nruns we computed the normalized c2 statistic and the results\nare shown in Figure 8.\n[29] Figure 8a shows the results for the case in which\nonly the vertical component of the rates is considered. There\nis significant trade-off between viscosity values in the upper\nand lower mantle. Consider, for example, the results for the\ncase of a 120 km thick lithosphere: c2 values of less than\nfive can be achieved with an approximately isoviscous\nmantle of \u00032\u20133 \u0001 1021 Pa s or with a two layer structure\ncharacterized by an order of magnitude jump in viscosity\nacross the 670 km interface (nUM \u0003 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, nLM \u0003\n5\u201310 \u0001 1021 Pa s). A similar trade-off has been identified in\ninferences based on relative sea level data [e.g., Lambeck et\nal., 1990; Mitrovica, 1996]. An important feature of the\nresults for vertical rates is the rapid increase in the misfit\nas the upper mantle viscosity is reduced below about 5 \u0001\n1020 Pa s for lower mantle viscosity values ranging from 3 to\n50 \u0001 1021 Pa s. This gradient is a consequence of the\nmarked decrease in the predicted present-day uplift rates as\nthe upper mantle viscosity is reduced below this threshold.\nFor such viscosity models, the relatively rapid isostatic\nuplift has yielded relatively small levels of remnant (i.e.,\npresent-day) disequilibrium.\n[30] Figure 8b shows the c2 results when only the\nhorizontal component of the rates is taken into account.\nSince the GIA model does less well in predicting the\nhorizontal rates compared to the vertical rates (see Figure 7\nand related discussion), the error bars for these data were\nscaled by a factor of 1.8 to produce a minimum c2 value\nthat matches that for the vertical rates. This scaling of the\nerror in the horizontal rates was performed as a preliminary\nattempt to account for the influence of uncertainties in the\nice model. In Figure 8b the region of viscosity space where\nthe best fit is achieved is significantly different from the\nlocation of the minimum in Figure 8a. In particular, upper\nmantle viscosities greater than \u00031021 Pa s, and lower mantle\nviscosities less than \u00033 \u0001 1021 Pa s are excluded on the\nbasis of the horizontal velocities. Thus, when considering\nmisfit for the combined horizontal and vertical motions\n(Figure 8c), a relatively small region of acceptable viscosity\nmodel space is isolated. We conclude that horizontal\nmotions provide constraints on viscosity which are distinct\nfrom those provided by observations which reflect vertical\ndeformation (radial crustal uplift rates, sea level changes).\n[31] Figures 8 (top), 8 (middle), and 8 (bottom) refer to a\ndifferent value for the adopted lithospheric thickness. (Our\ncalculations were extended to include lithosphere thick-\nnesses of 146 km and 171 km, but these results are not\nshown.) The model with a lithospheric thickness of 120 km\nwas found to produce the minimum c2 value (for nUM = 8 \u0001\n1020 Pa s and nLM = 10\n22 Pa s).\n[32] Applying an F test to the results shown in Figure 8c\n(bottom), yields the following 95% confidence interval:\n5 \u0001 1020 \u0002 nUM \u0002 1021 Pa s; 5 \u0001 1021 \u0002 nLM \u0002 5 \u0001\n1022 Pa s.\n[33] In Figure 9 the c2 results are plotted as a function of\nlithospheric thickness and nUM for a fixed nLM value of\n1022 Pa s. In this case, the radial rates show a relatively weak\ncorrelation between lithospheric thickness and upper mantle\nviscosity, while a strong trade-off is evident in the fits to the\nhorizontal rates. In regard to the latter, the quality of fit can\nbe maintained by increasing or decreasing both parameters\nsimultaneously within a given parameter range. As an\nexample, a good fit can be obtained for either a relatively\nthick lithosphere (\u0003140 km) and high nUM (\u00031021 Pa s), or\na relatively thin lithosphere (\u000380 km) and low nUM (\u00035 \u0001\n1020 Pa s). As we noted in the context of Figure 8, the\nvertical rates cannot be fit for nUM less than \u00035 \u0001 1020 Pa s\n(regardless of the value adopted for lithospheric thickness)\nand the 3-D rates prefer a relatively thick lithosphere, with a\n95% confidence interval of 90 to 170 km.\n[34] The optimum parameter ranges cited above are\nbroadly consistent with other inferences of mantle viscos-\nity based on GIA data from Fennoscandia. Using geo-\nlogical records of postglacial sea level change, Lambeck\net al. [1998a] inferred values of lithospheric thickness\n(65\u201385 km) and upper mantle viscosity (3\u20134 \u0001 1020 Pa s)\nwhich lie at the lower bound of our ranges. A companion\nstudy based on instrumented sea level records [Lambeck\net al., 1998b] yielded slightly higher values for both\nthese parameters (80\u2013100 km and (4\u20135) \u0001 1020 Pa s).\nWieczerkowski et al. [1999] have used their newly\nderived estimate of the Fennoscandian relaxation spec-\ntrum to infer a mean viscosity within the bulk of the\nsublithospheric upper mantle of \u00035 \u0001 1020 Pa s; this is\nalso near the lower bound of our inferred range. Most\nrecently, Kaufmann and Lambeck [2002] inverted a wide\nsubset of GIA data, including relative sea level histories\nfrom Fennoscandia, and derived bulk upper and lower\nmantle values (7 \u0001 1020 Pa s, 2 \u0001 1022 Pa s, respec-\ntively) near the center of our preferred ranges.\n[35] We next investigate the influence of the choice of\nice model on the inference of Earth model parameters. In\nFigure 10 we repeat the calculations of Figure 8 (for a\nlithospheric thickness of 120 km) using the ICE-3G\ndeglaciation history discussed above. The general location\nand structure of the c2 minimum in viscosity space is\nsimilar to that obtained with the LSJ model, although the\nc2 values are consistently higher for the ICE-3G predic-\ntions. We conclude that our choice between these two ice\nmodels does not significantly influence the inferred range\nof optimum Earth model parameters. It is interesting to\nnote that the specific Earth model used in the derivation of\nthe ICE-3G load history (LT = 120 km, nUM = 10\n21 Pa s,\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n10 of 18\nB02412\nnLM = 2\u0001 1021 Pa s) does not yield a good fit to the 3-D rates\nin Fennoscandia.\n[36] The forward modeling analysis presented above and\nthe inverse analysis presented below are based on single-site\nposition estimates for each of the BIFROST stations. The\nrates based on these time series may be systematically\nbiased due to perturbations in both the reference frame\nrealizations and the satellite orbits during the monitoring\nFigure 8.

The error would appear as a long-wavelength feature\nin the observed 3-D velocity field. A related point in this\nregard is the difficulty in separating long-wavelength con-\ntributions to the horizontal motion associated with GIA\n(e.g., the rotation-induced signal (Figure 5c) or that due to\nthe distant Laurentide ice sheet [Mitrovica et al., 1994b])\nfrom that associated with the rigid component of tectonic\nplate motion.\n[37] We have performed a regional strain rate analysis\nusing the BIFROST data to investigate the influence of\nthese issues on the accuracy of our viscosity inference\n(S. Bergstrand et al., Upper mantle viscosity from continu-\nous GPS baselines in Fennoscandia, submitted to Journal of\nGeodynamics, 2003). This type of analysis is less sensitive\nto long-wavelength signals in the observed velocity field.\nThe results based on the strain rate analysis give a 95%\nconfidence range for nUM of 3\u201310 \u0001 1020 Pa s and an\nFigure 9.

Inverse Analysis\n[38] The forward analyses summarized in Figures 8\u201310,\nalthough an extension of earlier work [Milne et al., 2001],\nprovide a rather coarse measure of the sensitivity of the\nBIFROST data to variations in mantle viscosity. As a simple\nexample, the correlation between values of nUM and nLM in\nFigure 8 preferred on the basis of radial velocity data\nsuggest that these data do not independently resolve the\nbulk upper and lower mantle viscosity. This point is part of\na broader question that serves as the focus of the present\nsection; namely, what is the radial resolving power of the\nBIFROST data set?\n[39] To answer this question, we perform a joint inversion\nof the BIFROST data set of present-day 3-D crustal veloc-\nities. For this purpose we adopt a Bayesian inference\nprocedure. As in previous work on the viscosity problem,\nwe parameterize the inversion in terms of the logarithm of\nviscosity in a set of discrete layers [e.g., Mitrovica and\nForte, 1997]. In this regard, the \u2018\u2018model\u2019\u2019 to be inverted for\nalso includes a final parameter equal to the thickness of the\nelastic lithosphere, and we can thus write\nX^ \u00bc log n rj\n\u0001 \u0002\nfor j \u00bc 1;N \u0005 1;LT\u0003 \u0004; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere j denotes the radial layer (j = 1 is the layer above the\ncore-mantle boundary, and j = N \u0005 1 is the layer below the\nelastic lithosphere) and LT is the lithospheric thickness\n(nondimensionalized using the radius of the Earth, a). The\nmodel X^ has a total of N parameters.\n[40] We have chosen to discretize the mantle viscosity\ninto a set of 22 uniform layers, with 9 residing within the\nlower mantle. Thus N = 23. The inverted model is\nspecified by both the a posteriori model and covariance\nmatrix. The diagonal elements of the latter provide the\nvariances of the 23 individual model parameters. The\nBIFROST data will not be capable of resolving structure\non the length scale of the individual viscosity model\nlayers, and therefore the a posteriori variances for these\nmodel estimates will not be substantially smaller than the\nprior variances adopted in the inversions (we have found\nthat the greatest reduction is of the order 30\u201340%). We\nwill estimate the resolving power of the BIFROST data by\nexamining the posterior covariance matrix. The spread of\nthe off-diagonal elements for, say, the jth row of this\nmatrix provides a measure of the radial resolving power of\nthe data for an estimate of viscosity at a depth\ncorresponding to the jth radial layer [e.g., Tarantola and\nValette, 1982]. As we note below, the a posteriori uncer-\ntainty for an estimate of the average viscosity over this\nresolving width will, in contrast to the uncertainty for an\nindividual model value, be significantly smaller than the\nprior uncertainty.\n[41] The prior and starting model for our inversion\ncorresponds to an Earth model with an elastic lithosphere\nof 96 km, an upper mantle viscosity of 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, and a\nlower mantle viscosity of 5 \u0001 1021 Pa s. The Fre\u00b4chet kernels\nare computed numerically using a suite of models in which\nthe viscosity in the 22 mantle layers and the lithospheric\nthickness are perturbed from the values defining this starting\nmodel. As an illustration, we show, in Figure 11, Fre\u00b4chet\nkernels for the prediction of the three components of crustal\nvelocity for a set of eight sites lying (south to north) along\nthe major axis of the Fennoscandian deformation region\n(see Figure 1a for site locations). To account for differences\nin the thickness of the radial layers, each plotted value of the\nkernels has been normalized by the (nondimensional) thick-\nness of the associated radial layer. Since the predictions\nhave a nonlinear dependence on mantle viscosity, the\nkernels will be a function of the model; nevertheless, the\nstarting model was adopted because it provides a near best\nfit to the BIFROST-derived estimates of 3-D crustal velocity\n(Figure 8c).\n[42] The Fre\u00b4chet kernels provide a measure of the de-\ntailed depth-dependent sensitivity of a particular datum to\nvariations in the radial profile of mantle viscosity. Predic-\ntions of radial velocity for sites within central Fennoscandia\n(Ma\u02dartsbo to Sodankyla\u00a8) based on the starting model show a\nbroad sensitivity to bulk upper mantle viscosity. Significant\nchanges in this pattern of sensitivity are evident as one\nconsiders sites closer to the perimeter of the Fennoscandian\nice complex at Last Glacial Maximum, Ha\u00a8ssleholm to the\nsouth and Kevo to the north. With the possible exception of\nHa\u00a8ssleholm, all predictions of radial velocity show a mod-\nerate, but nonnegligible sensitivity to variations in lower\nmantle viscosity (at least in the shallowest portions of this\nregion), and this explains the trade-off evident in Figure 8a.\n[43] The predictions of horizontal velocity show a distinct\nsensitivity to variations in the mantle viscosity profile.\nThese predictions have a sensitivity that tends to peak near\nthe top of the mantle. Furthermore, while there is little\nsensitivity to variations in viscosity within the top half of\nthe lower mantle, a nonzero sensitivity is apparent at some\nsites (e.g., Jo\u00a8nko\u00a8ping) near the base of the mantle.\n[44] Figure 12 shows the results of two inversions of the\nBIFROST data set. For each of these inversions the dotted\nline on Figure 12 represents the prior (and starting) viscosity\nmodel. The dashed line is the posterior model for a\npreliminary inversion in which the viscosity in layers within\nthe lower and, independently, the upper mantle, are assumed\nto be perfectly correlated; this assumption yields a two-\nlayer viscosity model characterized by nLM \u0003 1022 Pa s and\nnUM \u0003 5.5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, and lithospheric thickness of\n\u0003116 km. We note, in reference to Figure 8c, that this\nmodel falls close to the best fit model determined by our\nforward analysis.\n[45] The solid line on Figure 12 shows the radial viscosity\nprofile generated from a multilayer inversion of the\nBIFROST data set. In the upper mantle, this model oscil-\nlates around the starting\/prior model (with the exception of\na thin layer of low viscosity at the base of the lithosphere).\nIn addition, the model trends toward values in excess of\n1022 Pas in the top half of the lower mantle before returning\nto a viscosity close to the prior value near the base of the\nmantle. (The posterior estimate of lithospheric thickness in\nthis inversion is 104 \u00b1 6 km.)\n[46] The question arises as to whether these variations\nin the viscosity are actually resolved by the BIFROST\ndata set. To answer this question, we turn to Figure 13,\nwhich provides plots of the off-diagonal elements of\nthe covariance matrix for eight target depths (i.e., depths\ncorresponding to a specific layer of the model) ranging\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n13 of 18\nB02412\nfrom the shallow upper mantle to 1225 km depth. The\nindividual plots are normalized by the largest off-diagonal\nvalue and the diagonal element (i.e., the variance) is not\nshown. Below target depths of \u00031300 km we have noted\nthat the location of the peak off-diagonal element is gener-\nally widely displaced from the target and this indicates that\nthe BIFROST data do not provide significant radial resolu-\ntion of mantle viscosity in this region of the lower mantle.\nIn contrast, at progressively shallower depths, Figure 13\nindicates a resolving power which gradually improves.\n[47] Let us, for the purpose of illustration, define the\nresolving width as the radial range of the off-diagonal\nelements having values equal to or greater than 50% of\nthe peak off-diagonal value (i.e., width at half max). In this\ncase, the radial resolving power of the BIFROST data at the\ntarget depth of 230 km is \u0003200 km. This resolving power\nFigure 11. Fre\u00b4chet kernels (see text) as a function of radius for predictions of the three components of\npresent-day crustal velocity: solid line, radial; dashed line, horizontal south; dotted line, horizontal east.\nEach panel refers to a different site in the BIFROST GPS network (see Figure 1). Each value of the kernel\nis normalized by the (nondimensional) thickness of the associated radial layer in order to remove any\nsensitivity to layer thickness. The kernels each have 22 values, nine within the lower mantle and the\nremainder in the sublithospheric upper mantle. A 23rd value (not plotted or shown) used in the inversions\nrefers to changes in the thickness of the elastic lithosphere. The kernels were computed for a starting\nmodel defined as having a lithosphere of thickness 96 km, nUM = 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, and nLM = 5 \u0001 1021 Pa s.\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n14 of 18\nB02412\nreduces to \u0003380 km at a target depth of 468 km and\n\u0003640 km at 652 km depth. We can conclude, for example,\nthat both the low-viscosity layer of thickness \u000350 km at\nthe base of lithosphere and the high viscosity hump at\n\u00031400 km depth (solid line, Figure 12) are not resolvable\nby the BIFROST data. Furthermore, while target depths\nranging from 800 to 1300 km show relatively little covari-\nance with upper mantle viscosity values, some sensitivity to\nupper mantle structure is always evident; this is in accord\nwith the forward results in Figure 8c.\n[48] In Figure 12 we show three radial regions (bottom\nright) which are, according to Figure 13, resolvable by the\nBIFROST data. From deepest to shallowest, the weighted\n(by the resolving kernel) mean of the viscosity profile\nwithin these regions is: 8.9 \u0001 1021 Pa s, 5.4 \u0001 1020 Pa s,\nand 5.9 \u0001 1020 Pa s, respectively. Over depth ranges\nresolvable by the BIFROST data, the observational con-\nstraints lead to an order of magnitude reduction in the\nvariance of the averages.\n4. Final Remarks\n[49] The BIFROST Fennoscandian GPS network was the\nfirst to produce maps of the present-day, 3-D crustal\nvelocity field associated with GIA. In a general sense, these\nmaps confirmed the basic postglacial deformation pattern\nfirst predicted theoretically in the early 1990s [James and\nLambert, 1993; Mitrovica et al., 1993, 1994b], namely,\nongoing radial rebound of previously glaciated regions\nand horizontal motions directed outward from the zone of\nmaximum uplift. After roughly a decade of GPS data\ncollection, the observational uncertainties in the rate esti-\nmates are now sufficiently small (Figure 1) that increasingly\naccurate theoretical predictions must be brought to bear to\nanalyze the data. We have demonstrated, for example, that\nthe signal associated with recent improvements in the GIA\ntheory, for example the inclusion of crustal deformations\ndriven by perturbations in the Earth\u2019s rotation vector and a\nrefined treatment of the water load in the vicinity of an\nablating ice margin and evolving shoreline, exceed the\ncurrent observational uncertainty.\n[50] The ability of modern numerical models of the GIA\nprocess to accurately reconcile the BIFROST rate estimates\npermits a wide number of geophysical applications [e.g.,\nMilne et al., 2001]. The forward analyses described herein\ntouch upon two of the classic GIA analyses; namely,\nconstraining the space-time history of late Pleistocene ice\ncover and the radial profile of mantle viscosity. Our results\nindicate that the BIFROST data provide a potentially\npowerful test for models of the ice history (Figures 6 and\n7) and permit bounds to be placed on the bulk upper and\n(shallow) lower mantle viscosity and the lithospheric thick-\nness (Figure 8).\n[51] Our analysis was completed by performing the first\nformal inversion of the BIFROST data set. The main goal of\nthis inversion was a determination of the resolving power of\nthe GPS estimates of 3-D crustal velocities. In this regard,\nthe results in Figure 13 have several important implications\nFigure 12. Results of a Bayesian inversion of the BIFROST GPS data set. The dotted line represents\nthe starting and prior (two layer) viscosity model adopted in the inversion (nUM = 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, nLM =\n5 \u0001 1021 Pa s); the starting lithospheric thickness is 96 km. The dashed line is the inverted profile\ngenerated by assuming that the layers in the upper and (independently) the lower mantle are perfectly\ncorrelated (posterior LT = 106 km). The solid line shows the results for a full multilayer inversion of the\nGPS data set (posterior LT = 103 \u00b1 8 km). The off-diagonal elements for a subset of rows in the\nassociated posterior covariance matrix is given in Figure 13. The three horizontal lines at bottom right\nillustrate three of the radial regions which are resolved by the BIFROST data set (see text and Figure 13).\nB02412 MILNE ET AL.: FENNOSCANDIAN GPS MODELING RESULTS\n15 of 18\nB02412\nfor the forward analyses of mantle viscosity summarized in\nFigure 8. First, the inference of lower mantle viscosity\nimplied by the analysis in Figure 8 is more accurately\ninterpreted as a constraint on the viscosity in the top\n\u0003800 km of this region. This limitation should not be\nsurprising given the size of the Fennoscandian ice complex\nthat covered the region at Last Glacial Maximum (see\nMitrovica [1996] for a discussion). Furthermore, the\nBIFROST data are able to resolve structure on radial scales\nfiner that the entire width of the upper mantle. Specifically,\nthis resolution ranges from \u0003200 km just below the litho-\nsphere to \u0003300 km near the base of the upper mantle.\nAccordingly, a significant improvement in the fit of the\nforward models may be achievable by considering a suite of\nmodels with two or three isoviscous layers within the upper\nmantle.\n[52] As we have discussed, our inferences of viscosity\nwithin the upper mantle and the top portion of the lower\nmantle are reasonably consistent with previous studies\nbased (at least in part) on the GIA record within Fenno-\nscandia. We have inferred lower bounds of \u00035 \u0001 1020 Pa s\non the bulk upper mantle viscosity below Fennoscandia and\n\u000390 km on the elastic thickness of the Fennoscandian\ncraton. The resolving power of the data is not sufficient to\nrule out a thin low-viscosity region below the lithosphere;\nhowever, any region of significant weakness extending\n\u0003200 km or more from the lithosphere does appear to be\nruled out on the basis of the 3-D rates. The resolving power\nof the observations to depths of \u00031300 km will continue to\nimprove as the BIFROST time series are extended and the\nobservational error reduced further. Future analyses may\ntherefore be able to provide more robust constraints on the\nFigure 13.

Second, we will employ\na series of ice histories that are generated from a realistic\nglaciological model and are validated with observational\nevidence from the regional geological record. Third, we will\nincorporate independent data sets in the inversions. These\nwill include the so-called Fennoscandian relaxation spec-\ntrum [McConnell, 1968; Wieczerkowski et al., 1999] and a\nset of postglacial decay times determined from central\nFennoscandia [e.g., Mitrovica and Forte, 1997].\n[54] The incorporation of lateral variations in Earth struc-\nture will also serve as a focus for future work. These\nvariations, whether in the form of heterogeneities in litho-\nspheric strength or mantle structure, are an area of active\ninterest in GIA research [e.g., Kaufmann and Wu, 2002],\nand they will no doubt impact the prediction (and analysis)\nof the BIFROST GPS-determined rates. Members of the\nBIFROST Project have completed the development of a\nfinite element numerical formulation of GIA on aspherical\nEarth models (K. Latychev et al., Glacial isostatic adjust-\nment on 3-D earth models: A finite-volume formulation,\nsubmitted to Geophysical Journal International, 2003). The\nfuture application of this formulation to the present-day\nFennoscandian deformation field will be an important\nextension of the work presented here.\nAppendix A: Theoretical Formalism for\nComputing 3-D Surface Deformation\n[55] In the following, we provide a brief sketch of the\nspectral theory developed to calculate the three components\nof surface deformation associated with GIA. Computation\nof the impulse response of the (Maxwell) viscoelastic Earth\nmodel is based on a normal mode theory developed by\nPeltier [1974], Peltier and Andrews [1976], and Wu [1978].\nThis response is represented in terms of so-called visco-\nelastic Love numbers which, in the time domain, have the\nfollowing form [Peltier and Andrews, 1976]:\nhL\u2018 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc hL;E\u2018 d t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\nXJ\nj\u00bc1\nr\n\u2018;L\nj exp \u0005s\u2018j t\n\u0006 \u0007\n; \u00f0A1\u00de\nlL\u2018 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc lL;E\u2018 d t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\nXJ\nj\u00bc1\nr\n0\u2018;L\nj exp \u0005s\u2018j t\n\u0006 \u0007\n; \u00f0A2\u00de\nhT\u2018 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc hT ;E\u2018 d t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\nXJ\nj\u00bc1\nr\n\u2018;T\nj exp \u0005s\u2018j t\n\u0006 \u0007\n; \u00f0A3\u00de\nlT\u2018 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc lT ;E\u2018 d t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\nXJ\nj\u00bc1\nr\n0\u2018;T\nj exp \u0005s\u2018j t\n\u0006 \u0007\n; \u00f0A4\u00de\nwhere the superscripts L and T represent Love numbers for\nthe case of a surface mass load (load Love numbers) and\ngravitational potential forcing (tidal or tidal-effective Love\nnumbers), respectively. The first term on the right-hand side\nof equations (A1)\u2013(A4) denotes the instantaneous elastic\nresponse (hence the superscript E) to the associated forcing,\nwhile the second term is the nonelastic response. The latter\nis composed of a set of J modes of pure exponential decay.\nThe h and l Love numbers govern the radial and tangential\ndisplacement response, respectively, at spherical harmonic\ndegree \u2018. The adopted viscoelastic structure of the Earth\nmodel is embedded within these Love numbers.\n[56] With these expressions in hand we can proceed\ntoward a spectral formulation of the radial and horizontal\ncrustal displacement responses due to GIA. Let us denote\nthese responses as R(q, y, t) and V(q, y, t), respectively,\nwhere q is the colatitude, y is the east longitude, and t is the\ntime. A spherical harmonic decomposition of these fields\nmay be written as [Mitrovica et al., 1994a, 2001]\nR q;y; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX1\n\u2018\u00bc0\nX\u2018\nm\u00bc\u0005\u2018\nR\u2018;m t\u00f0 \u00deY\u2018;m q;y\u00f0 \u00de \u00f0A5\u00de\nV q;y; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX1\n\u2018\u00bc0\nX\u2018\nm\u00bc\u0005\u2018\nV \u2018;m t\u00f0 \u00derY\u2018;m q;y\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f0A6\u00de\nwhere m is the spherical harmonic order, r is the two-\ndimensional gradient operator, and Y\u2018,m is the surface\nspherical harmonic basis function. We adopt the specific\nnormalization\nZ Z\nW\nY\ny\n\u20180;m0 q;y\u00f0 \u00deY\u2018;m q;y\u00f0 \u00de sin q dqdy \u00bc 4pd\u20180;\u2018dm0 ;m; \u00f0A7\u00de\nwhere the dagger denotes the complex conjugate and W\nrepresents the unit sphere.\n[57] The GIA forcing is composed of contributions from\nthe surface mass load and a gravitational potential pertur-\nbation (the so-called rotational potential) arising from GIA-\ninduced changes in the planetary rotation vector. We denote\nthe spherical harmonic coefficients of the former by L\u2018,m\nand of the latter by L\u2018,m, respectively.
