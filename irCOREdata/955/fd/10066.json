I cannot find information from the charts easily. It allows me to easily keep track of all my patients results. Our charting of patient data is unreliable. The care planning is difficult to use Our charting system is poor at finding the information I want about my patient The charting system provides a good record of the patient. If things happen to my patient I will not be alerted by the charting system. The charting system helps in communication within the nursing team The charting system compromises patient confidentiality The charting system hinders communication within the health care team The care planning is not an efficient use of my time I feel that the charting does not help me to review my patients progress. The care planning helps me look after my patient The care planning documentation is repetitious. I don\u2019t think we keep track of our patients progress well. The charting system doesn\u2019t make me feel in control of the situation. The charting system alerts me to what is happening with my patient. I did not need much training to be able to use the charting system. The system in use for charting adds to my workload. The current charting system helps me to deliver quality care. The charting system is always legible. The charting system is always accurate","cites":null},{"id":198680,"title":"Taking care of clerical work.","authors":[],"date":"2001","doi":null,"raw":"Buchner A Erdfelder E Faul F (2001) http:\/\/ www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de\/aap\/projects\/ gpower\/how_to_use_gpower.html Duce, G.
