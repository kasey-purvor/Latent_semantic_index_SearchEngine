One of the difficulties for\nsubstitutional doping of carbon is the formation of unstable\ngraphitic structures, which results in a high defect density of\nstates \u0001DOS\u0002 at the Fermi level \u0001EF\u0002. Although several ex-\namples of conductivity enhancement of amorphous carbon\n\u0001a-C\u0002 films alloyed with light elements such as nitrogen were\nfound, a true signature of activated or delocalized transport\nhas rarely been demonstrated.1 In spite of the unique ability\nof carbon to mix with a large number of heavy elements,\nsynthesis of a homogeneous amorphous phase of metal-\ncarbon remains difficult.2\u20135 Nickel has been used for the re-\ncrystallization of carbon or the graphitization of carbon at\nhigh temperature \u0001\u0005500 \u00b0C\u0002.2,3 In the microstructure of\nmetal and carbon multilayers fabricated by ion bombardment\nor sputtering, the formation of metal and carbon clusters was\nattributed to non-homogeneous structures in the films.4 Simi-\nlarly, when mixed phase materials were attempted by substi-\ntutional doping of diamond by metal atoms or preparation of\ndiamond-metal composites, they yielded only metallic films\nhaving no signature of activated conduction.5 Due to the for-\nmation of metal clusters and nanostructures, tunneling of\nelectrons was found to dominate the conduction processes\neven at high temperatures and therefore, an activated con-\nduction, showing a small energy gap at low temperature, was\nrarely observed.5 We show that to achieve a homogeneous\namorphous phase or embedded nanostructures, laser ablation\ncan be utilized to mix insulators and metals. Metal catalysts\nmixed with carbon are routinely used for the growth of vari-\nous nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, at high tem-\nperature, where supersaturation of the vapor phase of carbon\nand metal is crucial in the formation of a stable metal-free\ncarbon nanostructure.6 It seems that by controlling the tem-\nperature and energy, the degree of supersaturation of the\ncarbon-metal mixture can be achieved, giving rise to a meta-\nstable amorphous phase. Keeping in mind that the initial\nstate of carbon is important to transform the film structure,\nwe introduce Ni into highly insulating sp3 carbon films by\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.bhattacharyya@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/89\u00022\u0001\/022113\/3\/$23.00 89, 02211\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The targets were\nrotated at a constant speed of \u0005100 rpm and a pressure of\n\u00052\u000110\u22127 Torr was maintained during the deposition at\nroom temperature. The target to substrate distance was fixed\nat 6 cm. These conditions ensured that during the periodic\nablation of each component, the thickness deposited was al-\nways less than a monolayer. These samples are approxi-\nmately 40 nm thick. From transmission electron microscopy\n\u0001TEM\u0002 performed on a Philips EM400 and field emission\nscanning electron microscopy \u0001FESEM\u0002 the structure of the\ncomposite film has been observed. The amount of nickel \u0001\n\u000510% \u0002 in the film was estimated from energy dispersive\nx-ray microanalysis and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.\nBy varying the rotational speed, laser flux, and ratio of Ni to\nC in targets, the percentage of Ni in the fixed composite films\ncan be controlled to some extent. However, in the present\nstudy we focus our efforts on a batch of samples containing\n10% Ni, due to their transport properties. Temperature de-\npendent conductivity has been studied at different tempera-\ntures down to 15 K from samples grown on glass. In addi-\ntion, a-C\u2013Ni\/Si heterostructures were fabricated on samples\ngrown on n-type silicon \u0001111\u0002 wafers \u0001resistivity\n\u00050.01 \u0002 cm\u0002.

From detailed microscopic studies\nincluding TEM and FESEM, no signature associated with\ncrystallites and large clustering of carbon \u0001e.g., graphite\u0002 or\nNi phases has been observed in the films \u0001Fig. 1\u0002.

On the other hand, the room\ntemperature conductivity of the a-C\u2013Ni samples is found to\nbe as high as 102 \u0002\u22121 cm\u22121 with the estimated value of the\nband gap much less than that of the undoped DLC films as\nrevealed from the comparison of the optical absorption edges\n\u0001not shown here\u0002. At a first look the variation of conductivity\nwith temperature suggests that an activated electrical process\n\u0001conductivity changes three orders of magnitude\u0002 is domi-\nnant over a wide range of temperatures \u000150\u2013300 K\u0002. From\nthe Arrhenius fit of conductivity an estimation of the activa-\ntion energy up to 0.05 eV \u0001from 300 K to 50 K\u0002 can be made\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. This very low value for DLC films appears to\nindicate that activated conduction occurs \u0001particularly in the\nhigh temperature regime where the conductivity is suffi-\nciently high\u0002. In parallel, Mott\u2019s variable range hopping\n\u0001VRH\u0002 conduction fits to the data, which is common for\nDLC films,1,7 was found not to fit to the conductivity data of\nthese samples \u0003Fig. 2 inset\u0004. From a crude VRH fit, a very\nhigh density of localized states \u0001which do not contribute to\nthe conductivity\u0002 may be estimated. However, the large con-\nductivity of the samples and its saturation at low temperature\nindicate that delocalized conduction within the films may be\nthe most likely explanation. A sharp decrease of the conduc-\ntivity \u0001up to three orders of magnitude from 300 K down to\n50 K\u0002 clearly shows that the transport properties of these\nmaterials are different from disordered alloys and dilute al-\nloys of magnetic ions \u0001Ni\u0002 in a non-magnetic host \u0001C\u0002.8 In-\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject toterestingly, although the amount of Ni is sufficiently high \u0001\n\u000510% \u0002, no metal-like temperature dependent conduction in\nthe films can be found, except at very low temperature. The\nconductivity is relatively low compared with high Ni-rich a\n-C films \u0001not shown here\u0002. The present conductivity trend is\nopposite to that observed in metal containing diamond,\nwhere, due to the presence of granular metal particles, a posi-\ntive temperature coefficient of resistance was observed over\na wide range of temperature.5 On the other hand, the VRH-\ntype transport explained by the percolation phenomena, as\npreviously observed in many different forms of metal incor-\nporated carbon films,8 is not pronounced in the present\ncarbon-nickel composite films \u0001over the entire range of mea-\nsurement\u0002. Two different slopes in the Arrhenius plot of the\nconductivity suggest a two-step conduction process due to\nthe change of slope of the DOS and the availability of extra\nstates, which will be discussed. The sharp change of slope is\nsignificantly different from a continuous change of slope,\nwhich is likely to be seen for VRH conduction at the band\ntail regions \u0001which is different to the present\u0002. The present\nactivated nature of conduction is also different from previous\nreports on metal incorporated a-C films, where a decrease in\nthe resistivity and activation energy with metal percentage,\nalong with a semi-metallic behavior observed at high\ntemperature.7 The coefficient of regression calculated for a\nVRH fit is well below unity \u0001and therefore cannot be consid-\nered as a good fit\u0002 and also the calculated DOS from the\nslope of the curve within a limited temperature range gives a\nlarge value of defect DOS, which cannot explain the high\nconductivity of these films and in particular the semi-\nmetallic conduction at low temperatures. If the defect DOS is\nlow and edges of bands are delocalized but separated by a\nsmall energy barrier it is possible at low temperature to over-\ncome such a barrier as schematically shown in the inset of\nFig. 3.\nIn the low temperature regime, the conductivity deviates\nfrom an activated process and a signature of non-zero con-\nductivity is pronounced, as if a borderline metal-insulator\ntransition point is reached. Moreover, the conductivity below\n25 K tends to saturate, followed by a slightly increasing\ntrend when the temperature was further lowered. We note\nthat a similar saturation conductivity at low temperatures has\nbeen seen in nanotubes, intercalated graphite fibers, and car-\nbon foils.9\u201312 However, there is a significant difference in the\n11,12\nFIG. 3.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 022113 \u00022006\u0001When the heterostructure properties of a a-\nC\u2013Ni\/Si was measured, I-V characteristics show rectifica-\ntion behavior of up to two orders of magnitude implying\nsemiconducting behavior. A relatively high leakage current\nmay be explained on the basis of a Schottky-type or Poole-\nFrenkel \u0001or hopping\u0002 conduction process with Coulomb-like\ntraps. The plots do not show linear behavior, unlike data\npreviously discussed for DLC films.12\nIn order to prepare a homogenous carbon-metal compos-\nite film, we examine manners in which to control their mi-\ncrostructure based on the dominance of adatom-substrate-\natom \u0001adhesive\u0002 energy over the adatom-adatom \u0001cohesive\u0002\nenergy. If the cohesive energy exceeds the adhesive energy,\nsmall clusters will nucleate on the substrate surface and\nmetal islands will be formed.4,13\u201315 However, when the two\nenergies are equal there is a strong possibility for the forma-\ntion of homogeneous mixture of the metal and insulator.4\nRegarding the carbon microstructure, it is well understood\nthat graphitization or the formation of the sp2-bonded carbon\nnanostructures can be enhanced in the presence of metal,\nwhere the metal particles act both as a nucleation site and a\ntransport medium for the carbon atoms evaporated by laser\nablation.16 In order for crystallization to occur, even in nano-\nvolumes, rapid quenching is required to free excess energy,\nwhich promotes amorphization, if allowed to release slowly.\nIn the case of a carbon\/metal mixture, when cosputtered at\nlow temperature, an amorphous phase is produced. Whereas,\ncrystallization of these materials can occur at high\ntemperature.3 We note the temperatures of graphitization by\nadding Ni to diamond, and DLC lie between 500 and\n900 \u00b0C.2 In contrast, all our samples were grown at 300 K to\navoid the formation of graphitic or crystalline phase change.\nThe increase of conductivity in a-C films by adding a\nsmall quantity of Ni, as previously reported,17 can be well\nunderstood from the electronic structure of the material using\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. Valence band \u0001VB\u0002 photoemis-\nsion measurements on Ni films on a-C or graphite previously\nshowed an intense peak at \u00051 eV below EF corresponding to\nthe 3d8 band of nickel.18 As Ni forms a homogeneous mix-\nture of C\u2013Ni, instead of forming clusters in these films, no\nstrong peak of Ni \u0001except a change of slope close to \u00050 eV\u0002\nis observed in the VB spectra \u0001in Fig. 3\u0002 even though the\nphotoionization cross section of the VB electrons for Ni is\nmore than ten times higher than that of carbon.19 On the\nother hand, features of carbon including \u0003 and \u0004 bands at\n\u00054 and \u00058 eV, respectively, are clearly visible from both\na-C and a-C\u2013Ni samples20,21 \u0001Fig. 3\u0002. It is difficult to dis-\ntinguish the contribution from Ni or C in the VB spectra\nsimilar to previous reports.21 The most interesting feature of\nthe spectra is the large electron count at EF \u0001here 0 eV\u0002 com-\npared with undoped a-C films, which clearly demonstrates a\nfinite DOS at EF as proposed from the analysis of low tem-\nperature conductivity of the samples \u0001Fig. 2 inset\u0002. The elec-\ntronic structure of the films is depicted schematically \u0001Fig. 3\ninset\u0002 showing the presence of additional DOS at EF. These\nstates may arise due to the formation of sp2 bonded carbon\nby nickel incorporation. Above all, from the conductivity\nstudy we think these states could be delocalized and can\ncontribute to the conductivity. In addition, we have studied\nnear edge x-ray absorption fine spectra of a-C\u2013Ni films and\n*found a significant difference in the intensity ratio of \u0003 to\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to\u0004* peaks compared with DLC films \u0001not shown here\u0002.\nDemonstration of DLC-based electronic devices has\nbeen difficult due to localization.22 However, a large de-\ncrease of resistivity and activation energy with superior elec-\ntronic properties, over the undoped DLC films, of a mixed\namorphous C\u2013Ni phase can be produced by periodic laser\nablation of rapidly rotating targets. These results are very\ndifferent from metal containing diamond or undoped DLC\ncarbon films, where either a semimetallic or variable range\nhopping conduction process dominates.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership Award and Carbon Based Electronics Pro-\ngrammes for the financial support.\n1S.
