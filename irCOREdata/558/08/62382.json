Abandoned mineshafts are ground disturbances that have very localised effects on the morphology, \nphysical, chemical, drainage and moisture properties of the surface geological materials and thus thermo-\nphysical properties. Remotely sensed thermal infrared surveys provide the potential for a rapid, \ninexpensive and non-intrusive technique for mineshaft detection.  The key parameters of thermal infra-red \nradiation and the application of remote thermal infra-red surveys to planning are described, using case \nhistories from former mining areas in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.  Field-measured \ninfrared temperature differences correlated well with different ground conditions caused by changes in \nvegetation, disturbance, compaction and moisture-drainage regimes.  A thermal anomaly over an area of \napproximately 6 m2 above a known mineshaft was characterised by traces of methane and increased \ntemperatures of between 0.5 oC to 1 oC in comparison to the adjacent ground surface.  Using thermal \ninfrared images, collected with the Daedalus 1260 Airborne Thematic Mapper, a scheme was developed \nto classify and map mineshafts with and without any observed visual characteristics.  When applied using \ncommercially flown thermal imagery the scheme identified several potential sites of abandoned \nmineshafts in an area designated for the redevelopment of the Nottingham Business Park, East Midlands.  \nThe thermal anomalies were associated with minor topographic features such as mounds, depressions, \ndereliction and also, compositional features caused by coal enrichment and coal-measures mudstone infill.  \nThese features had very little surface expression and were only confirmed using soil stripping. \n \nIntroduction \nMining has been practised in the British Isles since pre-historic times and has been a significant industry \nfor several centuries. Records indicate up to 170,000 mine entries have been known to have existed within \nthe UK.  It has been estimated that a further 150,000 mine entries may exist, many of which have since \ninfilled (Caunt 2008), however, many of their locations are either unknown or inaccurate (Gunn et al. \n2004). They can represent a significant environmental hazard, in the worse cases, posing the danger of \ncollapse as well as the potential to leak noxious gases and acid mine waters. The benefits of detecting \nmineshafts before they are disturbed by construction or during site development are twofold: safety is \nincreased and costs are reduced.  No definitive technique exists that can reliably detect all such \nmineshafts. Geophysical techniques can be employed with some success, but they are not always effective \nand some professionals lack confidence in them. They also involve extensive ground surveying, which \ncan be time consuming and expensive. Drilling and trenching can also be used but, as well as time and \nexpense, this approach involves disruption to the ground under study and safety issues. The need for \nrapid, cost effective and non-intrusive techniques is clear. \n \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n2 \nRemote sensing techniques have been employed in several other aspects of geoscience to investigate large \nareas quickly, with a reduced reliance on field techniques (Sabins 1978; Lillesand & Keifer 1987). They \nare certainly rapid and are inexpensive when compared to extensive ground surveys. As they involve no \ncontact with the matter under study they leave the site undisturbed. To realise the wider potential of \nremote sensing for the detection of mineshafts it is necessary to identify a characteristic that they exhibit \nwhich can be observed or recorded from an aircraft or satellite. Mineshafts with a clear surface expression \ncan be recognised in aerial photographs, but do not form the target of this study. Abandoned mineshafts \nwith no obvious surface expression require a different approach. Currently, many remain unrecorded and \nthus their existence is commonly unsuspected and their location unknown.  \nUsing case histories from former mining areas in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, this paper \npresents a strategy for the use of remote thermal infra-red surveys prior to site development.  Using a field \nsite example from St. Helens, Lancashire, this paper reviews the application of thermal infra-red \ntechniques to detect mineshafts. The effects of the ground conditions and disturbances about the \nmineshaft upon the thermal infrared radiation process are explained, and, remotely sensed images from \nBaildon Moor, Yorkshire are used to provide a correlation between the observed visual and the thermal \ncharacteristics of mineshafts.  Finally, data from Nottinghamshire are used to demonstrate the application \nof commercially flown thermal infrared images to identify mining disturbances with no observed surface \ncharacteristics prior to the development of the Nottingham Business Park, where the existence of \nabandoned mineshafts was confirmed by soil stripping. \n \nEffects of the ground conditions upon the thermal infrared radiation \nA shaft in the ground can be thought of as an air-filled void, which is commonly capped to some degree. \nAir and solid rock have different thermal properties and hence, a temperature difference can be expected \nto occur between the two. Generally, mineshafts are cooler than their surroundings for much of the year, \nbut in winter, at certain times of the diurnal cycle, mineshafts will be warmer than the enclosing ground, \nparticularly during freezing conditions. Dependant on the effectiveness of the mineshaft capping a \nthermal anomaly may be produced at the earth\u2019s surface. Anomalously high temperatures have been \nobserved to cause melting of frost over capped mineshafts, and measurements indicate that anomalies can \naverage 2 oC \u2013 3 oC under ideal conditions (Donnelly & Meldrum 1997; Donnelly & McCann 2000). \nGases are associated with some mineshafts and can exert an influence on the strength of the thermal \nanomalies through possible exothermic reactions as they reach the surface. There is a tendency for gases \nto build up during periods of high atmospheric pressure and to be released on a drop in atmospheric \npressure (Carter & Durst 1955; Durst 1956). Where abandoned mineshafts are open and have an obvious \nsurface expression, the most likely cause of the thermal anomaly is the temperature contrast between the \nshaft-filling air and the surrounding ground. Where shafts have a less obvious surface expression, there is \nlikely to be infill material between the shaft opening and the ground surface, or even an engineered \ncapping. The thermal anomalies over such shafts may relate to the temperature contrast between ground \ndisturbances and materials associated with the shaft and the surrounding ground. Ground disturbances can \nbe due to excavation of a shaft or related actives of hauling, crushing, bagging and sorting, and \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n3 \ntransportation. Buildings and water pumping works would also disturb the ground and provide potentially \nanomalous surface areas. These ground disturbances have very localised effects on the physical, chemical, \ndrainage and moisture properties of the surface geological materials. All of these properties have a direct \nand significant control on the diurnal heating and cooling cycles of the ground and on its ability to radiate \nheat energy. Soil density changes are caused by shaft excavations, compaction by heavy trafficking about \nthe shaft, mixing of surface soils with deeper derived rock spoil and looser shaft infilling materials. Shafts \nand associated ground fractures can either drain surface waters or provide spring sources for rising mine-\nwaters (Jackson et al. 1987; McCann et al. 1987). Thus, localised disturbances to water-flow, drainage \nand material density will create secondary moisture content changes in the vicinity of a mineshaft.  \nChanges in soil chemistry are caused by the mixing of surface soils with the mining spoils, and also by \nshaft infilling with materials, sometimes borrowed from sources outside of the local area. Soil chemistry, \ndensity, drainage and moisture content changes affect the localised distribution of the flora, and thus the \nheat radiation pattern about mineshafts. \n \nCase History: Pewfall Colliery, St. Helens \nSite location, geology and ground conditions \nThe Pewfall Colliery was roughly mid-way between St. Helens and Wigan. Since the cessation of mining \nthe site has been returned to agriculture, but some fenced off mineshafts remain in neighbouring fields. \nBedrock geology consists of the Lower Coal Measures Formation, the Middle Coal Measures Formation \nand the Ravenshead Rock with a regional dip of 30\u00b0 to the south-east. The site is cut by a normal fault \nthat is downthrown to the south-west, with a dip of 70\u00b0 and strikes to the south-east (Fig. 1a). The \nbedrock geology is overlain by Glacial Till to an unknown thickness but, possibly up to 10m thick. Two \n50 m x 50 m survey grids were established and denoted Site B, which was on a gentle, south-west facing \nslope, and, Site C, which was in a shallow trough that widened and whose axis also dipped to the south-\nwest (Fig. 1b).  The focus of this paper is site C but the Gunn et al. 2006 provide detailed field \nmethodologies and results for both sites.  The x-axis of Grid C was orientated approximately west to east, \nbut dipped to the south-east by 3\u00b0. The origin of the grid was located at BNG co-ordinates 355209E, \n398346.88N. The elevation range across the grid was 3 m. \n \nLooking across Grid C, long grass generally covered the area below y = 13 m and beyond x = 44 m (Fig. \n1b); generally long grass gave way to very short grass up to y = 20 m and below x = 15 m; vehicle rutting \nwas confined to a small zone near y = 50 m; an island of wet, disturbed and turfed up ground roughly  \n20 m in the x-dimension by 25 m in the y-dimension was centred about x=32 m, y=36 m; standing water \/ \nice occurred over a 5 m wide island in the trough along a section of x = 40 m from y=15 m to 32 m, over \nthe Coal Measures sub-crop; other areas comprised dry, flat ground with coarse brick and stone gravel \nsized rubble. \n \nSurvey conditions, equipment and methods \nThe survey over Grid C was undertaken from 01.00 to 05.20 on the 26th February 2004.   Generally, the \nwinter of 2003 \u2013 2004 had been fairly mild, and in the weeks leading up to the survey, there were several \nrainy spells.  However, the week before the survey was characterised by very clear, sunny days with \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n4 \nfreezing temperatures in the evening.  There was only one spell of rain within this week, which occurred \nfrom 04.00 to 10.00 on the 24th February 2004.  A decrease of 5mbars in barometric pressure was \nrecorded during the survey. \n \nA FLIR TERMCAM PM 675 was used for the survey.  This had a minimum focal distance of 0.3 m, a \nspatial resolution of 1.3 mradians and a typical sensitivity of 0.1 oC at 30 oC.  Measurements were taken \nover a 50 m by 50 m grid of points at every 2 m in both x and y directions (i.e. 26x26=676 points per \ngrid).  At each measuring point within the grid the camera was held directly above the ground at head \nheight such that an area of approximately 1 m2 could be imaged.  The temperature attributed to the \nmeasurement point was the average of all the pixel values within the image (320x240).  Thus, an overall \naveraged value of the ground was measured that was insensitive to the small-scale changes associated \nwith footprints, grassy tufts, tyre ruts and so on. These values are presented as a contoured image \ncovering the whole 50 m by 50 m grid.  Control points were established where a series of repeat readings \nwere taken throughout the duration of the survey.  These repeat readings formed a baseline of \ntemperature-time variation, which was used to correct the gridded survey for background temperature \ndrift.  The control point for Grid C was at x = 0 m, y = 0 m on the grid.  The gridded image presented in \nFig. 1c is corrected for background temperature drift. \n \nThermal infrared radiation from the ground \nThe thermal IR emitted from the ground over Grid C is shown in Fig. 1c.  The line work overlay \ndelineates the key surface and underlying geological features over the grid (from Fig. 1b).  The confirmed \nposition of a 3 m diameter brick-lined, back-filled mineshaft is denoted by the circular target with a \ndiagonal cross at 28 m, 14 m. The coldest parts of the grid coincide with the dry, flat ground containing \ncoarse brick rubble.  In fact, the amount of brick rubble was sufficient to give this area of ground a \nbrown-red colour.  This ground appeared to be of low moisture content and very well draining.  The low \ntemperatures are suspected to be due to heat losses caused by evaporation.  A large cold target centred \napproximately at x=21 m, y=25 m has been highlighted for possible further investigation, but it is \nsuspected that the anomaly is due to the large amount of brick rubble in the ground, for example \nconsistent with buildings located here formerly.  Another notable cold target is centred along x=50 m \nfrom y=20 m to y=36 m.  This is within the zone of long grass, within which there are areas of very long, \ndry wispy grass that had frosted up where pockets of cold air may have been trapped.  It is possible that \nthis cold zone is related to variability to the underlying ground, which may comprise made-ground \nassociated with former railway works that were understood to have once occupied the site.  The cold \ntarget within the wet, disturbed and turfed up ground coincides with a small island of brick rubble. \n \nWarm targets of note include an oval zone roughly 5 m by 4 m centred at x=32 m, y=37 m, and also \nlesser targets at x=36 m, y=44 m; x=38 m, y=50 m and x=13 m, y=4 m.  It was noted that the first three \ntargets occur in grass-free areas, whereas the target at x=13 m, y=4 m occurred within the zone of long \ngrass.  The target at x=38 m, y=50 m coincided with standing water and ice that was observed during the \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n5 \nsurvey, and it is suspected that the target at x=36 m, y=44 m was also associated with ice.  Soil gas \nsampling across the largest anomaly at x=32 m, y=37 m indicated the presence of very minor amounts of \nmethane and complete deficiency of oxygen in the ground that is compatible with methane oxidation.  \nFig. 2 shows a profile of analyses of gas samples taken along x = 32 m across the warm target at y=37 m. \nExothermic oxidation of methane would provide additional heat into the ground and this is very \ncompelling evidence for the presence of a mineshaft in the zone highlighted.    \n \nApplication of remotely sensed thermal IR to detect mineshafts \nRemotely sensed thermal infrared provides the potential for a low cost and non-intrusive technique that \ncan aid mineshaft detection. It offers the benefit of providing rapid coverage over large swathes of \nground.  Using modern scanning technology, thermal infrared images can be gathered in the same way as \naerial photographs.  With the development of an appropriate scheme, localised thermal anomalies \nassociated with ground disturbances can be analysed and mineshafts, both with and without any surface \nexpression identified.  Knowledge of the mining history of an area aids the identification of the coal \nseams that were mined and provides details of the size and structure, the approximate height above the \nseams and the geology of the mine entries.  This information forms the basis for the criteria against which \nmine entries are interpreted on thermal images.  It also provides a guide to the potential location of \nunrecorded mineshafts.  Mineshaft location on thermal images is particularly successful in former mining \nareas where the land is derelict or returned to farming, where later ground disturbances have largely \nremoved the obvious surface expression of a mine entry.  However, the ground still holds a record of \nmany of the ground disturbances related to the existence of the original mine entry, and these can be \ndetected as anomalies on thermal images. \n \nCase History: Baildon Moor, Yorkshire \nSite location, geology and ground conditions \nBaildon Moor comprises an outlier of Coal Measures resting conformably upon the Millstone Grit Group \n(Fig. 3). The word Baildon can be translated as \u2018the hill of pits or mines\u2019, where mining may have begun \nduring the occupation of the Roman Legions, about 200 AD. Baildon town is located in West Yorkshire, \nEngland, about 10 km north of the City of Bradford. Baildon Moor covers about 20 km2 and has an \nelevation of 280 m above sea level at the summit. It rises above Baildon town on a thick scarp of the hard \nRough Rock sandstone (R in Fig. 3b). The flat top is formed by the 80 Yard Rock sandstone-capping \nlayer. About 20 m below is an extensive plateau, which is formed in the 48 Yard Rock sandstone. Coal-\nbearing rocks of the Lower Coal Measures (Waters et al. 1996) are sandwiched between this lower \nplateau and the thick scarp above Baildon town. The Coal Measures show a gentle dip of between 1o and \n4o to the south-south-west within the area of Baildon Moor.  Therefore, over much of the study area the \ndepth to coal seams, the Hard Bed (HB in Fig. 3b) and Soft Bed (SB in Fig. 3b), was largely a function of \nthe surface topography.  Shallow depth, bell pits into the Coal Measures are distributed around the \nperimeter of the lower plateau, and larger diameter, deeper mineshafts can be found in, and above the \nlower plateau. However, in the north and west of the study area the depth to coal is controlled by \ndisplacement along a series of steeply dipping normal faults (Fig. 3a).   \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n6 \n \nBell pits were usually initiated from shafts with a diameter of approximately 1 m - 2 m down to the coal \nseam with a maximum depth of around 10 m (Waters et al. 1996).  Coal was then excavated at the base to \na maximum diameter of around 6 m, limited only by the collapse potential of the roof.  However \nLittlejohn (1979) does record excavations up to 20 m in diameter.  The majority of bell pits are associated \nwith working of the Hard Bed Coal.  As bell pits were only excavated to approximately 10 m depth, it is \npresumed that they lie exclusively between the outcrop of the Hard Bed Coal seam and the base of the 48 \nYard Rock sandstone.  It is unlikely that any casual bell pit development would have been undertaken \nthrough this hard sandstone and so the base of the 48 Yard Rock can used as a reasonable upper boundary \nto presence of bell pits.  Many of the bell pits were characterised by a conical depression of up to 4 m \ndiameter and 2 m deep (Fig. 4 shows a typical example).  Spoil rings when present, appeared as a low \nlying circular ring less than 0.5 m high with an outer diameter of up to 6 m.   \n \nMining in excess of 25 m probably began occurring in the UK in the 18th or 19th Centuries, requiring more \nefficient winding gear and techniques of pumping out groundwater. It is believed that in the early works \nat Baildon, the coal would have been removed by a shafthead windlass.  While the maximum depth of \nshaft using this method limited to 20 m \u2013 25 m, it was still sufficient to mine the Hard Bed Coal. The \nshafts over the plateau formed by the 48 Yard Rock in the vicinity of Dobrudden Caravan Site appear to \nhave been of this type.  The arrangement of these mineshafts is in a grid of approximately 100 m \ndimensions. Mining was in the form of room and pillar away from each shaft centre. Also, ventilation of \nthe deeper pits would have involved an up- and a down-shaft, to allow a through flow of air. Many of the \nabandoned shafts were characterised by a spoil ring with a 20 m outer diameter around a central zone of \naround 12 m diameter (an example is shown in Fig. 5).  This central zone can be flat with infill soil, water \nfilled or a conical depression up to 5 m deep.  The spoil ring can be built up to 3 m above the outer \nground level or a low lying annulus less than 0.5 m high.   \n \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \nTable 1.

This pattern suggested that an additional mineshaft could be located in \nthe approximate position of the anomaly cluster in this area. The unaccountable thermal \nanomalies appeared to correspond either to an area of wet, boggy ground and reed grass or to 6m \ndiameter circular areas of short grass. Two anomalies in the pre-dawn thermal image were \nparticularly large and had potential to be mineshaft sites. \n2: Not mapped \nas shaft when \nsurface  \nexpression \ndisturbed. \nYes \/ No Yes > 20 m \nMineshaft \nLCM in \nfaulted \nzone \nAn area of mapped mineshafts, shafts visible on aerial photographs and several unaccountable \nthermal anomalies.

The ground appearance at the location of unaccountable \nthermal anomalies was similar to some of the mapped mineshafts, with shorter grass \nsurrounding reed grass.

Thermal infrared radiation at wavelengths of \n8-14 microns are recorded as band eleven. High resolution data were acquired over Baildon Moor, \nYorkshire on two days, 15 September 1996 and 2 May 1997. Data capture took place immediately pre-\ndawn on both dates, and there was an additional late morning capture on 2 May.  Two flight lines of the \n1997 data were required to cover Baildon Moor. For both the pre-dawn and daytime images the two flight \nlines were georeferenced, mosaiced together to make one image and a contrast stretch was applied (Fig. \n6). The pre-dawn image was geocorrected to 1:10,000-scale Ordnance Survey maps and the daytime \nimage geocorrected to the pre-dawn image. The data supplied by the NERC Airborne Remote Sensing \nFacility had been corrected radiometrically prior to delivery, using the relevant calibration data (this \nprocess transforms data from sensor digital numbers to an absolute scale of radiance). \n \nClassification of features on remotely sensed thermal infrared image \nData available for the study, in addition to the thermal images, were a 1:2,500-scale mine abandonment \nplan, a 1:10,000-scale field survey map and a set of 1:25,000-scale aerial photographs acquired on the \nsame date as the May 1997 thermal data. A comparison was made between the location of anomalies \nidentified in the thermal images, the location of mapped mineshafts and mineshafts with a clear surface \nexpression in the aerial photography.  Examples of the criteria used in the comparison (as explained \nabove) are summarised in Table 1.  The classification of the thermal anomalies was based upon the degree \nof difficulty in observing the ground disturbances on aerial photographs and in the field.  For example, \nareas 4 and 5 provide thermal evidence for the presence of shafts where there is little or no visible \nexpression of the entry.  Visual observation of mine entries in area 4 was obscured by very thick bracken \ncover.  Shaft entries were characteristically a 12 m diameter depression of up to 3 m deep surrounded by a \nnarrow spoil ring of about 15 m diameter.  Where the bracken cover was thin, for example at the shoulder \nof the plateau formed by the 48 Yard Rock, mine entries were still visible and thus mappable (Fig. 7a).   \nHowever, the bracken was very thick on the slope of the hill where mine entries were not necessarily \nobserved and mapped.  However, Fig. 7b shows the depression, believed to be an abandoned mineshaft, \nof approximately 15 m diameter associated with a cluster of thermal anomalies in this area. \n \nMine entries in area 5 have been disturbed by later farming activities, such as ploughing, and the ground \nin this area is generally flat with little obvious surface expression.  Thus, field observation of abandoned \nshafts was very difficult, where only the subtlest of vegetation changes indicate the presence of a former \nshaft, such as a concentration of clover over a former spoil ring as shown in Fig. 8a.  In this case, the \nchange in vegetation was visible on the aerial photograph, but other abandoned shafts, such as Shafts 1, 3 \nand 4 in Fig. 8b were not so clear, and thus, missed during interpretation.  However, the \u2018bull\u2019s-eye\u2019 \ntarget features at the locations of Shafts 1 to 4 were visible on the late morning thermal image (Fig. 8c), \nand were interpreted as former shafts, but were not readily observed in the pre-dawn image (Fig. 8d).  \n \n1 Supplied by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Airborne Remote Sensing Facility \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n9 \nNote also, a cluster of former bell pits on the LCM between Shaft 3 and the small copse of trees to the \neast, which were not readily observed in the field. \n \nIntegration of remote thermal IR in site development planning \nPlanned construction of the Nottingham Business Park at a former mining site in west Nottingham \nhighlighted the need for the abandoned mineshafts that underlay the site to be accurately located. \nAppropriate sealing of the shafts prior to site development could then take place.  Coal Authority records \nindicated in excess of thirty abandoned mineshafts over the Chilwell Dam Farm Site, (see Table 2). \nBefore designation for the development of the Nottingham Business Park in 2002, wheat was cultivated \nin the fields and fruit trees grew in the orchard next to the farm buildings at Chilwell Dam Farm.  Thus, \nmost of the mine entries were obscured and very difficult to observe in the field. Mineshaft locations \ntranscribed from a British Geological Survey field slip (Table 2) were originally transcribed from Coal \nAuthority records. However, the precision in their location could not be taken to be less than \u00b120 m on \neither the easting or the northing.   The flight path of a planned commercial thermal infrared flight (by the \nNottingham Energy Partnership for a building heat loss study) was extended to provide thermal images \nover the site.  The scheme developed at Baildon Moor was applied to Chilwell Dam Farm to improve the \nexisting information on shaft locations held by the developers BWB Consulting Ltd.  This provided the \nopportunity to compare the effectiveness of the scheme using a commercial 8-bit sensor2 from Chilwell \nDam Farm with the data from the NERC 16-bit sensor from Baildon Moor. \n \nTable 2.

It is approximately 800 m at its widest and 1.8 km at its longest. It comprised a roughly triangular \narea of farmland with its eastern boundary along the A6002, its northwestern boundary along the M1 \nmotorway and other boundaries formed by hedgerows. Access to the site was via a slip road that runs off \nthe A6002.  Limestone of the Cadeby Formation carbonate facies (formerly the Lower Magnesian \nLimestone) outcropped over most of the site (Fig. 9b).  Dip was sub 10o with a prevailing easterly \ndirection.  A normal fault striking ESE \u2013 WNW with a northerly down throw side cut through the site.  To \nthe west of the site the Lenton Sandstone overlies the Edlington (Marl) Formation, which overlies the \nCadeby Formation carbonate facies.  At the NE corner of the site the Cadeby Formation carbonate facies \nis underlain by the Cadeby Formation mudstone facies (formerly the Lower Marl), which rests \nunconformably on Middle Coal Measures. A cover of Glacial Till was found on the small hill formed by \nthe Lenton Sandstone on the west side of the site. \n \nCoal has been mined west of Nottingham since at least the Middle Ages and probably considerably earlier \n(Charsley et al. 1990). Much of the wealth of the Willoughby family, who constructed Wollaton Hall in \nthe 16th century, and other Nottingham landowners was founded on coal mining in the area of an exposed \nand shallowly concealed coalfield west of Wollaton Hall (c.f. Fig. 9a). By 1604 Huntington Beaumont \nconstructed a wooden wagonway from bell pits at Strelley down to Wollaton Lane, for carriage to the \nNottingham market (Healey 2001).  During the 19th Century, mines were generally leased from \nlandowners by partnerships of mining entrepreneurs, who raised the necessary capital for development.  \nVillages like Hucknall and Bulwell in the Leen Valley grew to accommodate the workforce. Improved \nsteam pumping could drain deeper shafts, and some of the first deep shafts were sunk in 1841 at \nCinderhill, and in 1851 at Hucknall. Before the First World War, coal production from Britain\u2019s 3,024 \nmines was at its peak (Healey 2001). Nottinghamshire coalmines stretched the length of the county and in \nEastwood alone 40% of the workforce were employed down the coal pits.  After many pit closures in the \n1980s, most of the sites have been completely cleared. Many spoil heaps have been reshaped and re-\nplanted while others have been reused as industrial estates. \n \nAfter the mining ceased, the site located at Chilwell Dam Farm (Fig. 9) was returned to orchards and  \nplantations surrounded by pasturelands (Ordnance Survey, 1885). The shallowest coal at the site is \nCinderhill Main Seam, which is a metre thick at a depth of 22 m, (National Coal Board 1959). The \ndistribution of the abandoned mineshaft locations suggests an ad hoc approach to mining on the land \nwhere the landowner leased mining rights to several different co-operatives (as was the practice at the \ntime). If this is the case then mining may have been via the use of unusually large bell pits (Whittaker & \nReddish 1989). Some shafts would have been lined either to provide stability from collapse or spalling of \nthe rock, or possibly, to control the ingress of water into the mine workings. Shafts have been commonly \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n11 \nlined since the 17th Century and many materials have been used.  Littlejohn (1979) reported the use of \nwooden planks arranged vertically like a barrel, and Boulton (1907) reported that it was common for \nshafts less than 3.5 m in diameter to use moulded brick linings in the 19th Century.  Fig. 10 shows a brick-\nlined shaft of approximately 2m in diameter that was observed on the Chilwell Dam Farm site at BNG \n51285, 42342; mineshaft no. 32 in Table 2. The lining is of dry-stacked red-brick and its collar is within \n1.5m of the ground\u2019s surface. \n \nVegetation was lush where present but when viewed from a short distance (in June 2001), it was apparent \nthat much of the ground surface was bare soil and for most of the area still in crop furrows. The north and \nnorthwest sections of the site, recently used as arable grazing, were covered in a lush growth of grasses \nand meadow plants. In some areas immediately surrounding the farm site and in the far northwest of the \nsite, it appeared that no recent agricultural activity had taken place and as a result, a dense vegetation \ncover was present.  \nTable 3.

Data were acquired pre-midnight on 15 February 2001 and pre-dawn on 12 March \n2001. Pre-dawn was the preferred time of data acquisition for shaft detection hence the pre-dawn dataset \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n12 \nwas the focus of the research at the Chilwell Dam site. Two flight lines provided full coverage of the \nChilwell site. The flight lines were georectified and mosaiced together prior to interpretation of the \nmosaiced image. Generally, thermal anomalies that seemed most likely to relate to mineshafts were dark \nrelative to the rest of the image and circular in shape (Ager et al. 2004). Such anomalies were marked on \nthe thermal image to be subjected to investigation in the field, prior to, during and after the top soil was \nstripped from the site. Several larger anomalously dark areas were also marked on the image, for field \ninvestigation.  \n \nInterpreted thermal infrared image \nA comparison was made between the location of thermal anomalies, mineshafts with a clear surface \nexpression on the 1:25,000 scale aerial photographs and the location of mapped mineshafts on a 1:10,000 \nfield slip and from the Coal Authority records (Table 2 above).  A comparison of the aerial photographs \nwith the \u2018known\u2019 mineshaft locations revealed that some shaft sites were easily identified as areas of \nlighter tone of near-circular shape, approximately 10m in diameter, often with trees nearby. Using these \ncriteria, the rest of the photograph coverage was examined for similar features. Only 17 potential shaft \nlocations were identified, 15 of these were in agreement with known shaft locations.  Over 50 thermal \nanomalies were identified across the site, which in general, corresponded to at least one of the following \nfeatures that were observed in the field: soil, vegetation, topographic or ground condition changes (Table \n3). \n \nThermal anomalies were identified to coincide with the expected position of approximately half of the \nknown mineshafts listed in Table 2, as shown in Fig. 11.  Generally, lack of detection was due to other \nfeatures obscuring the localised anomaly caused by the shaft.  For example, Shaft 8 was masked on the \nthermal image by a cold dark zone caused by very damp ground. Many of the shaft locations occurred \nbeneath trees, whose warm thermal signatures would have obscured the effects of the shafts.  Non-\ndetected shafts included Shaft 20, which appeared in the field as a large oval of 12 m diameter up to 2 m \ndeep with a pool of water 1m deep, and also, Shaft 32, which appeared as a lined opening (Fig. 10). \n \nOver the site, spoil had been reused to backfill the shafts on closure, causing localised soil changes via \nintroduction of mostly mudstone, coal and brick fragments. Backfilling with extraneous materials would \nhave led to topographic changes leaving mounds and soft ground, and also, resulted in changes in local \nsoil chemistry and ground conditions, thus favouring subtle differences in localised vegetation.  Evidence \nof backfilling was more readily observed where the land had been very recently farmed, such as at Shaft \n10.  However, many of the primary soil changes were not completely detected until after the site was \nstripped of the top soil.  The thermal anomaly related to Shaft 15 from Area 1 in Fig. 11 coincided with a \n0.5 m high mound, approximately 30 m across, with a circumferential ring of nettles surrounding a central \ncore of clover, dandelions and broad leave weeds (Fig. 12a).  Only slight soil darkening by coal was noted \nduring the initial site visit, but soil stripping revealed localised backfilling with light grey Coal Measures \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n13 \nmudstone, brick and coal fragments (Fig. 12b).  The changes in vegetation were very subtle resulting in \nmany shaft locations, such as Shaft 3 coinciding with a cluster of anomalies.  Soil stripping revealed this \narea to be of very variable stiffness, where soft patches coincided with backfilling of mudstone, coal and \nbrick fragments.  Shaft 5 coincided with a patch of nettles approximately 15 m in diameter. Shaft 6 \ncoincided with a very minor vegetation change to lusher, longer grass over an area of about 3 m in \ndiameter, where geophysical surveys revealed very large, localised perturbations in the electrical \nconductivity and magnetic field profiles indicative of magnetic materials such as bricks of scrap-iron (Fig \n13). \n \nConclusions and recommended practices \nAnomalies in thermal IR images are known to have been associated with mineshafts.  These are either \ndirectly related to an air filled shaft but more often are related to the ground disturbances and materials \nassociated with the shaft.  Ground disturbances include effects due to density changes caused by soil \nmixing, moisture content changes caused by the presence of a shaft and also chemistry and related \nvegetation changes. \n \nFrom Pewfall a warm thermal anomaly coinciding with a 3 m diameter brick-lined, backfilled shaft was \nfound to be associated with methane oxidation.  At Baildon Moor, thermal anomalies had a \u2018bull\u2019s-eye\u2019 \ntarget structure of diameters to around 20 m related to the shaft and surrounding ground disturbance.  The \nrelative temperatures of these features depended upon the ground conditions and materials comprising the \ncentral core and surrounding annulus.  The location and geology of the mine entries guided the \ndetermination of the style and depth of mining, i.e. to distinguish between bell pitting and pillar and stall \nmining.  Abandoned shafts with clear surface expressions such as on the 48 Yard Rock plateau produced \nvery clear thermal anomalies on pre-dawn and late-morning images.  Also, in farmed areas thermal \nanomalies on the late-morning image were interpreted as shafts that were difficult to observe visually \nfrom aerial photos or in the field.  The final case history at Chilwell Dam Farm typifies situations across \nthe UK where development is being considered on newly acquired land that has been left derelict due to \nformer mining and farming activities.  Surface features related to mine entries are obscured making aerial \nand field observation extremely difficult, but leaving subtle changes in localised ground conditions that \nresult in contrasts in the localised thermal infrared radiation.  A scheme applying thermal imagery to aid \nthe identification of abandoned shafts could be included as part of the planning process.  It would be \nenvisaged that the identification and location of thermal anomalies would lead to better planned field \nitineraries designed specifically to locate the more subtle disturbances related to former shafts, and thus, \nincrease detection rate. \n \nRemotely sensed data from Baildon Moor were acquired using a 16 bit (216) binary coding scale, whereas \nthe data from Chilwell Dam Farm were acquired using an 8 bit (28) binary coding scale.  This resulted in \nthe images from Baildon Moor being far sharper due to a greater depth of grey-level providing far greater \nSubsidence 2008 - Gunn \n14 \ncontrast within the image. Both pre-dawn and daytime thermal images have been shown to be useful for \nmineshaft detection. The information content of the images is distinct and complementary. Ideally both \npre-dawn and daytime thermal data should be acquired for a mineshaft detection study. In addition to \nproviding supplementary information on mineshaft location compared to single diurnal acquisition, \nacquisition of both pre-dawn and daytime data enables thermal inertia study to take place. Daytime \nacquisition should take place as close to noon as practicable. If cost or other limitations restrict \nacquisition to a single diurnal period then pre-dawn acquisition should be selected due to the minimal \nthermal shadowing; thermal shadowing can mask features within a daytime thermal image. \n \nSuccessful data acquisition for mineshaft detection must take into account seasonal and meteorological \nconditions. Mineshaft detection performance of a thermal image is significantly influenced by \nprecipitation receipt, temperature, and barometric pressure conditions in the period leading up to and \nduring data acquisition. The study has confirmed that thermal data acquisition for shaft detection should \nbe conducted during a period of dry weather. In particular, the study highlighted the significance of \ntemperature in the period leading up to data acquisition on shaft detection capability. Colder conditions in \nthe period leading up to data acquisition appear to result in the greatest contrast between mineshaft and \nsurroundings in a thermal image. It is therefore preferable to conduct thermal data acquisition in Winter \nor Spring, not Summer or Autumn. Precipitation, temperature and pressure should be monitored in the \nfield prior to and during thermal data acquisition, and significant weight given to meteorological \nconditions in the timing of data acquisition. Ground temperature measurements will also be required if \nairborne radiance data are to be calibrated to temperature.  \n \nWherever possible, modern multi-spectral sensors should be used on all new airborne reconnaissance \nflights such that data in the visible and infrared band can be collected with the greatest level of binary \ncoding scale.  In order to maximise mineshaft detection from a thermal image precise geometric \ncorrection of the image must take place. Use of control based on GPS or Ordnance Survey 1: 1,250 scale \nLandline data should be considered. For data acquired by the NERC aircraft a digital elevation model \nshould be used with the NERC geocorrection software. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British Geological Survey \n(NERC).
