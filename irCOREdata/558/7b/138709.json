INTRODUCTION \nSwirling flows are frequently found in nature and also occur in a wide range of \npractical applications, such as gas turbine combustors, agricultural spraying machines, \nwhirlpools, cyclone separators and vortex shedding from aircraft wings. Since the \nmajority of swirling flows operate in a turbulent environment, it is necessary to \nconsider the unsteady flow oscillations during the flow evolution. Investigation of \nprecession, recirculation, vortex breakdown and instabilities have received much \nattention [1-5] and recently several groups have studied the jet precession, oscillation \nmechanisms and the role of precessing vortex core (PVC) in which the centre of the \nvortex precesses around the central axis of symmetry [6-7]. In combustion systems, \nthese phenomena promote the coupling between combustion, flow dynamics and \nacoustics [7].  \n \nSeveral groups have identified various forms of precession motion and instability \nmodes in both reactive and non-reactive swirling flow fields [8-9]. Experimental \nevidence has shown that, configurations, the existence of a PVC depends on the \noccurrence of vortex breakdown and on having a swirl number greater than its critical \nvalue [10]. However, PVC also occurs at low values of swirl number where a swirling \njet is released into a large expansion. Dellenback et al. [11] observed several \nprecession mechanisms in experiments involving swirling pipe flow over a range of \nhigh swirl numbers. Alternatively, Sozou and Switenbank [12] carried out an \nanalytical calculation using an inviscid model for PVC phenomena and found a \nreasonable agreement with the data of Chanaud [10] and Cassidy et al. [13].  \nAveramenko et al. [14] carried out further investigations and found that the PVC \nfrequency is linearly dependent on both the mean inlet velocity and is a weak function \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 4 \nof viscosity. Sato et.al. [15] carried out the first computational modelling work using \nthe Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) technique for the PVC phenomena and  \ndeduced a number of oscillation mechanisms. Guo et al. [16] carried out a RANS \nsimulation for a turbulent swirl flow passing into a sudden expansion, and found a \nlarge PVC structure and a particular combination of precession and flapping \noscillations for zero swirl strength. However, RANS based methods are only \nsuccessful for flows with non-gradient transport and therefore do not provide the level \nof accuracy required for the prediction of a large scale highly unsteady PVC.  \n \nLarge eddy simulation (LES) has been widely accepted as a promising numerical tool \nfor solving the large-scale unsteady behavior of complex turbulent flows. \nEncouraging results have been reported in recent literature and demonstrate the ability \nof LES to capture the swirling flow instability and the energy containing coherent \nmotion of the PVC. For example, Wegner et al. [17] carried out LES calculations for \nisothermal swirling flow fields and captured the PVC phenomena with a good degree \nof success. Roux et al. [18] performed an LES of an isothermal flow field in a gas \nturbine combustor and accurately predicted both the major PVC oscillation frequency \nand a strong second acoustic mode. This example, further demonstrates the capability \nof LES to capture the strong coupling between the acoustics and the swirling flow \ndynamics. Selle et al. [19] also carried out LES of an industrial gas turbine burner and \ncaptured the entire PVC structure of the isothermal flow field. Wang et al. [20] \ndetected the low frequency oscillations and precession for their LES calculations of \nconfined isothermal swirl flows.  Recently, Wang et al. [21] conducted LES \ncalculations of flow dynamics for an operational aero engine combustor and found \nencouraging results for the PVC phenomena.  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 5 \n \nDespite extensive reviews, the investigation of unsteady flow oscillations such as \nvortex shedding and the occurrence of the PVC in swirl stabilized systems remains a \nchallenge. Interactions between different instability modes can cause considerable \nnoise fluctuations as a result of the oscillating pressure field. Further investigations \nare necessary to identify the link between the oscillation mechanisms and the jet \nprecession in swirl stabilized jets [4][9].  \n \nThe present work focuses on a series of LES calculations for isothermal flow fields \nbased on the Sydney swirl burner configuration and demonstrates the features of jet \nprecession (often starting at moderate swirl number) as well as the existence of PVC \nassociated with a bluff body [22-24]. The Sydney swirl burner configuration has also \nbeen extensively investigated as a target model problem for computations in the \nProceedings of Turbulent Non-Premixed Flames (TNF) group meetings [25].  \n \nThe swirl configuration used in this work features unconfined swirling flow fields \ngenerated by an upstream recirculation zone and a second downstream recirculation \nzone induced by swirl, which greatly improves the mixing process. In addition, the \nswirling flow fields generate central jet precession and a PVC structure close to the \nburner exit. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present the correlations between \naxial, swirl and vortex breakdown instabilities associated with central jet precession \nand analysis the occurrence of PVC using the Strouhal number and geometric swirl \nnumber.  \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 6 \nIn our earlier studies, we have shown that LES accurately predicts different \nisothermal swirling flow fields of the Sydney swirl flame series [26], and later have \nextended the work to reacting cases [27-28]. The current work is a continuation of our \ninvestigations of flow recirculation, vortex breakdown, oscillations and instabilities \nassociated with the isothermal swirling flow fields. Results will be presented for the \npower spectra, Strouhal and swirl numbers.  \n \nThe layout of this paper is as follows. Section II presents the details of Sydney swirl \nburner configuration. In Section III we will present the computational method \nincluding the governing equations, discretisation methods and boundary conditions. \nResults from the simulations and comparison with experimental data will be discussed \nin Section IV. Finally, a short summary in Section V will conclude the main findings \nof this paper. \n \nII. THE SYDNEY SWIRL BURNER \nA schematic of the Sydney swirl burner configuration used in this work is shown in \nFig. 1. It has a 60mm diameter annulus for a primary swirling air stream surrounding \nthe circular bluff body of diameter D=50mm with a 3.6mm diameter central fuel jet. \nThe jet fluid for isothermal cases is air. The burner is housed in a secondary co-flow \nwind tunnel with a square cross section of 130mm sides. Swirl is introduced \naerodynamically into the primary annulus air stream 300mm upstream of the burner \nexit plane and inclined 15 degrees upward to the horizontal plane. The swirl number \ncan be varied by changing the relative magnitude of tangential and axial flow rates. \nVelocity measurements were made at the University of Sydney [22-24]. The literature \nalready includes the details flow conditions such as flow types, their velocities, swirl \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 7 \nand Reynolds numbers [23-24]. The flow conditions considered in the simulations \npresented here are shown in Table 1. Here jU is the central jet velocity, sU is the bulk \naxial velocity of the annulus, Sg is the swirl number, jRe and sRe are the Reynolds \nnumbers of the jet and annulus respectively.  \njU  3.16=sU    \n400,32Re =s  \n7.29=sU  \n000,59Re =s  \njRe  \n66 gS  0.57-0.91 gS   0.28-0.45 14300 \n \nTable 1.The flow conditions considered for simulations [24]  \n \nIII. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD \nA. Mathematical formulations and numerical methods \nIn LES the large energy containing scales of motion are resolved numerically while \nthe effect of the small, unresolved scales is modeled. The flow is assumed to be \nisothermal and incompressible.  Applying a spatial box filter to Navier-Stokes \nequations, we obtain the filtered continuity and momentum equations for the large-\nscale motion as follows \n \n 0=\u2202\n\u2202\nj\nj\nx\nu\n  (1) \n \nj\nij\nj\nij\nij\njii\nxx\nS\nx\nP\nx\nuu\nt\nu\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212=\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202 )()2(1)( \u03c4\u03bd\n\u03c1\n.

Hence, subsequent \nmodelling is required for ( )jijiij uuuu \u2212=\u03c4  to close the system of equations. The \nSmagorinsky eddy viscosity model [29] is used here to model the SGS stress tensor as \n \n1 2\n3\nijij ij kk sgs S\u03c4 \u03b4 \u03c4 \u03bd\u2212 = \u2212 .

The localized dynamic procedure of Piomelli and Liu [30] was \nused to obtained the model parameter sC , which appears in equation (4) as a part of \nthe SGS turbulence modelling. This model uses information in the resolved flow \nfields to determine the model parameter dynamically. As such, the parameter varies in \nboth time and space based on local flow conditions.   \n \nThe governing equations are discretised on a non-uniform, three dimensional, \nstaggered Cartesian grid by using the LES code PUFFIN originally developed by \nKirkpatrick [31] and later extended by Ranga Dinesh. [32]. PUFFIN calculates the \ntemporal development of large-scale flow structures by solving the filtered LES \nequations for mass and momentum (Eq. 1 and 2). The LES equations are discretised \nin space using a finite volume method.  A second order central difference scheme is \nused for the spatial discretisation of momentum equations and pressure correction \nequation. First, the momentum equations are integrated using a third order hybrid \nAdam-Bashforth\/ Adam-Moulton scheme to give an approximate solution for the \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 9 \nvelocity field. Mass conservation is enforced through a pressure correction step in \nwhich the approximate velocity field is projected onto a subspace of divergence free \nvelocity fields. The pressure correction method of Van Kan [33] and Bell et al. [34] \nwas used in the present calculations. The solution is advanced with a time step \ncorresponding to Courant number less than 0.6. The equations, discretised as \ndescribed above, are solved using a linear equation solver. Here a Bi-Conjugate \nGradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) solver with a Modified Strongly Implicit (MSI) \npreconditioner is used. The momentum residual error is typically of the order 510\u2212  per \ntime step and the mass conservation error is of the order of 810\u2212 . Further details of the \nnumerical methods used can be found in Kirkpatrick et al. [35-37]  \n \nC. Boundary conditions \nThis section describes the boundary conditions used for the simulations. The mean \nvelocity distributions for the jet and annulus flows were specified using power law \nvelocity profiles [26-28]. The mean profiles for both axial and swirl velocities are \nspecified by a power law of the form \n \n7\/1\n1218.1 \u0001\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212>=< \u03b4\ny\nUU j , (5) \nWhere jU  is the bulk velocity, y  the radial distance from the jet centre line and \njR01.1=\u03b4 , where jR  is the fuel jet radius of 1.8 mm. The factor 1.01 is added to \nensure that velocity gradients are finite at the walls. The same equation is used for the \nswirling air stream with jU  replaced by the bulk axial velocity sU  and bulk \ntangential velocity sW , y  the radial distance from the centre of the annulus and \n01.1=\u03b4 h\/2,  where h is the width of the annulus. Turbulence at the inlets is modelled \nby superimposing fluctuations on the mean velocity profiles generated from a \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 10 \nGaussian distribution such that the inflow has the correct turbulence kinetic energy \nlevels obtained in the experimental data. At solid walls a free slip condition is applied. \nAt the outlet, a convection boundary condition is used.  \n \nD. Domain size, grid and statistics \nThe computations were performed on non-uniform Cartesian grid in a domain with \ndimensions300 300 250mm\u00d7 \u00d7 . The grid has 100 100 100\u00d7 \u00d7 cells in the x, y and z \ndirections respectively giving a total of one million cells. Grid lines in the x  and y  \ndirections use an expansion ratio of ( ) ( 1) 1.08xy x i x i\u03b3 = \u2206 \u2206 \u2212 =  and an expansion ratio \nof 07.1=z\u03b3  is used in the z-direction. A grid sensitivity analysis for a high swirl case \n(swirl number 1.59) published in our earlier work [26] indicated that reasonable grid \nindependence is achieved for the mean velocity fields and Reynolds stresses with this \ngrid. All simulations were carried out for the total time period of ms300  and two non-\nconsecutive sampling periods yielded similar results indicating that the statistics were \nwell converged.  \n \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe Sydney swirl burner is designed to study reacting and non-reacting swirling flows \nfor a range of swirl numbers and Reynolds numbers. This section discusses the LES \nresults focussing on features of the swirling flow fields such as recirculation, vortex \nbreakdown, central jet oscillation and PVC structures for various flow conditions. \nFirst the occurrence of vortex breakdown, recirculation and its relationship with the \nswirl number will be discussed. Results will then be presented to demonstrate the \ncentral jet precession and PVC structures for different flow conditions. Finally, a \ncomparison plot for a Strouhal number will be discussed. The results obtained from \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 11 \nthe LES calculations will be discussed in two cases. Case I involves flow features for \nmoderate swirl numbers at the primary annulus axial velocity of 7.29=sU m\/s, while \nCase II involves high swirl numbers at the primary annulus axial velocity of \n3.16=sU m\/s. \n \nCase I: Analysis of recirculation, vortex breakdown, precession frequencies, \nprecessing vortex core (PVC) and Strouhal number for 7.29=sU  m\/s at swirl \nnumbers 45.0,40.0,34.0,28.0=gS . \n \nA. Recirculation and vortex breakdown  \nFig. 2 shows four contour plots of mean axial velocity and clearly shows the upstream \nrecirculation zone and downstream vortex breakdown. For swirl numbers 0.28, 0.34, \nno negative velocities are observed on the centreline and hence no vortex bubble \nformed. For swirl numbers, 0.40, 0.45, the mean axial velocity becomes negative on \nthe centreline, which indicates the occurrence of a vortex breakdown bubble (VBB). \nIncreasing the swirl number also increases the axial extent of the vortex bubble. Figs. \n3 and 4 show isosurfaces of the negative mean axial velocity at a value of 2.0\u2212 m\/s \nfor swirl numbers 0.40 and 0.45 respectively. The plots reveal that the expansion of \nthe upstream recirculation zone is similar; however the growth of the downstream \nvortex bubble differs slightly. We have also found that the increased swirl velocity \nhas a minor impact on the formation of VBB in the downstream region and that the \nVBB promotes the shear layer instability in the downstream recirculation zone.    \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 12 \nFig. 5 shows the calculated centerline mean axial velocity for a range of swirl \nnumbers 45.0,40.0,34.0,28.0=gS . The calculations of centerline negative mean axial \nvelocity indicates a flow reversal. For the cases with swirl numbers 0.40 and 0.45, the \ngreatest negative axial velocities of 7.2\u2212 m\/s and 5.4\u2212 m\/s occur at approximately \nx=80mm and x=65mm respectively. For these two cases, the mean axial velocity is \nnegative within the range of x=70 \u2013 95mm and x=47 \u2013 90mm respectively. The jet \nvelocity decays in a similar manner in the downstream section for all cases.  \n \nB. Precession frequencies and precessing vortex core (PVC)  \nFigs. 6-8 show the power spectra for swirl numbers 0.34, 0.40 and 0.45 at the spatial \njet locator. The spatial jet locator is positioned just off the burner centerline at \nx=12.3mm (axial location) and r=2.3mm (radial location) similar to the experimental \ninvestigation. A pair of monitoring points are used on either side of the centre jet [22-\n24]. \n \nThe power spectrum is constructed by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to \nthe instantaneous axial velocity at the jet locator point. The power spectrum for the \ncase 34.0=gS  has a distinct peak at a frequency of ~24 Hz, which indicates the \noccurrence of precession. The power spectrum for 40.0=gS  has a number of peaks \nat low frequency with the highest at approximately 24Hz, which is slightly lower to \nthan that found in the experimental observation (26Hz) [24]. The spectrum for \n40.0=gS  also has smaller peaks at 50Hz and 75Hz. These may be attributed to the \ncritical swirl number for downstream VBB, where the VBB start to disappear. The \npower spectrum for 45.0=gS  has the highest peak at ~26Hz. All distinct precession \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 13 \nfrequencies obtained from the present simulations are very close to the experimentally \nobserved values [24].  \n \nFigs. 9 and 10 show instantaneous isosurfaces  of static pressure at 45.0,40.0=gS  \nand demonstrate the PVC structure outlined by a pressure value of p= -85Pa. In the \nlow swirl case ( 40.0=gS ) the PVC structure is more coherent than in the high swirl \ncase ( 45.0=gS ) and both PVC structures occur at same central jet precession \nfrequency value. For both cases, the low-pressure core aligns with the centerline. The \nupstream extent of the vortex bubble is much larger for the case 45.0=gS  than for \n0.40, which changes the downstream PVC structure as shown in Fig. 10.   \n \nC. Strouhal number \nThe Strouhal number plays a vital role in detecting precession motion and provides a \nbasis for precession analysis in both isothermal and reacting swirl flow applications. \nConventionally, the Strouhal number can be defined as QfDe3 , where f is the \nfrequency, De is the exhaust diameter of the swirl burner and Q  is the volumetric \nflow rate [9].  For this study, the Strouhal number is calculated as ss WfrSt 2= , \nwhich is consistent with the experimental definition [24]. Here again, f is a \nprecession frequency, sr is the radius of the bluff body and sW is the tangential \nvelocity of the primary annulus. Fig. 11 shows good agreement between predicted and \nmeasured values of Strouhal number for detected precession frequencies. The only \ndiscrepancy appears for the case 40.0=gS  for which the LES  underestimates the \nprecession frequency. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 14 \nCase II: Analysis of recirculation, vortex breakdown, precession frequencies, \nprecessing vortex core (PVC) and Strouhal number for 3.16=sU  m\/s at swirl \nnumbers 91.0,68.0,57.0=gS . \n \nA. Recirculation and vortex breakdown \nFig. 12 contains contour plots of the mean axial velocity showing the upstream \nrecirculation zone and the downstream VBB at the three swirl numbers. The \ndownstream vortex bubble is only formed for swirl numbers 0.57 and 0.68. Despite \nhaving the highest swirl number, no vortex bubble is formed for the case 91.0=gS . \nTherefore the downstream flow reversal disappears at some intermediate swirl \nnumber between 68.0=gS  and 0.91. Similar behaviour has been observed by the \nexperimental investigation [24]. Fig. 13 shows the predicted centerline mean axial \nvelocity for the three test cases. A small vortex bubble is formed only for the swirl \nnumber 68.0,57.0=gS . The stagnation point occurs at mmx 70=  for 57.0=gS  and \nat mmx 82=  for 68.0=gS . The jet velocity decays in a similar manner in the \nupstream section and varies slightly in the range mmx 10040 \u2212=  as a result of the \ndownstream recirculation zone. In case II, the flow conditions are different and hence \nsize of the downstream VBB is significantly smaller than that found in case I.  \n \nB. Precession frequencies and precessing vortex core (PVC)  \nThe power spectra at a spatial jet locator are shown in Figs. 14-16. Fig. 14 shows the \npower spectrum for a case 57.0=gS . The LES calculates a precession frequency \nvalue of 30Hz, which is slightly greater than the experimental value (28Hz) [24]. The \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 15 \npower spectrum for 68.0=gS  accurately predicts the precession frequency value of \n28Hz in comparison to the experimental value (see Fig. 15).  \n \nAs shown in Fig. 16, for 91.0=gS the LES gives a precession frequency value of \n26Hz and contains high peaks in the low frequency range. The cases 68.0=gS  and \n0.91 have more distinct peaks at the precession frequency than 57.0=gS  and the \ncalculated precession frequency values are much closer to the experimental values \n[24].  Fig. 17-19 show instantaneous isosurfaces of static pressure for swirl numbers \n91.0,68.0,57.0=gS  respectively. As with the PVC for the lower swirl numbers \nshown in Figs. 9 and 10, it can be seen that the complexity of the PVC increases as \nthe swirl number increases.  \n \nC. Strouhal number \nFig. 20 shows the agreement between the predicted and measured values of Strouhal \nnumber based onthe precession frequency. The only discrepancy with the \nexperimental value appears at 57.0=gS  where the LES slightly overestimates the \nprecession frequency. This further demonstrates the possibility of using LES to study \nthe jet precession and oscillation mechanisms in turbulent swirling flows.  \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have reported results for large eddy simulations of isothermal \nswirling flows based on the Sydney swirl burner, which was experimentally \ninvestigated by Al-Abdeli and Masri [23-25]. Two major test cases based on different \nprimary annulus axial velocity have been considered. The two major cases were \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 16 \nfurther divided into seven different test cases based on different swirl numbers in \norder to study the influence of swirl number on recirculation, vortex breakdown, \nprecessing vortex core and precession frequencies.  \n \nThe LES successfully simulated the recirculation zones, vortex breakdown bubbles \nand precessing vortex cores for all test cases. In particular, the precession frequencies \nfor the central jet precession have been captured and are in excellent agreement with \nthe experimental measurements as seen through a comparison of the Strouhal \nnumbers [24]. There appears to be a relation between the central jet precessions and \nthe axial extent of the vortex bubble, however, further investigation is required to \nexplore the relationship between the central jet precession and the downstream vortex \nbubble. The results of this study show that LES seems to be suitable for investigating \ninstabilities in swirling jets. This is an important finding, since there is a need for \nmore fundamental LES investigations on the mechanisms of instability modes and \nPVC in combustion systems. Further work on coupling mechanisims between \ninstability and combustion would certainly help to improve the knowledge of \ncombustion instabilities in swirl combustion systems and we intend to extend our \nwork for the instability analysis of swirl combustion systems.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 17 \nREFERENCES \n[1] Sarpkaya T.
