It is a political\nhot potato as well: noise annoyance is a factor that a government trying to\nmake the case for a third runway at Heathrow must deal with \u2013 tens of\nthousands of people will hear its noise. So, when a study commissioned by\nthe Department for Transport claimed that people are becoming less tolerant of\naircraft noise than they used to be, it was, to say the least, highly unpleasant\nreading for supporters of a third runway. But the DfT had major concerns\nabout the report. Peter Brooker senses the vibrations.\n1. Aircraft: Too Loud and Too Many\nWe almost all like to fly, but few of us want to live under an airport flight-path. The\nnoise that planes inflict affect the quality of life, to say nothing of house-prices, in the\nneighbourhoods beneath. Proposals for changes to airports, such as the third\nrunway for Heathrow, have to include descriptions of how they will change noise\nexposure \u2013 although estimating the total noise from aircraft over the course of a day\nis actually very complex. In the UK, noise contours around airports use an index\ncalled Leq, short for Equivalent Continuous Sound Level, which is essentially the\nnoise energy received on the ground. It is measured in decibels; it takes into account\nboth the noise levels of aircraft and their number, and averages the sound energy\nfrom all aircraft movements in a certain area over a 16 hour period each day,\nbetween seven in the morning and eleven at night. (Sleep disturbance from night\nflights is a separate UK policy concern \u2013 but an equally, if not more, serious issue for\nmany people.)\nThe UK Department for Transport [DfT] has used Leq following the 1985 Aircraft\nNoise Index Study (ANIS)1,2 conclusion that there was no better metric than Leq in\nterms of correlation between aircraft noise and community annoyance. The\nGovernment decided to adopt the use of Leq to describe noise, and decided that 57\nLeq marks the approximate onset of significant community annoyance from aircraft\nnoise. 57 Leq has often been termed Low Community Annoyance, Medium\nAnnoyance is 63 Leq, and 69 Leq registers on the scale as High Annoyance.\nIn mid-2001, the DfT announced a major study into aircraft noise: They subsequently\ncommissioned commercial contractors (led by MVA Consultancy Ltd) to conduct the\nANASE (Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England) project to investigate,\namong other things, the relationship between aircraft noise and annoyance\n2\u2018\u2026the new study underlines the Government\u2019s commitment to underpin our\npolicy on aircraft noise by substantial research that commands the widest\npossible confidence\u2019 they said. .\u2019\nThey hoped this new research would command such confidence. They added that\nconclusions from the original ANIS research had been\n\u2018\u2026broadly confirmed by other studies here and abroad, and we have no\nreason to doubt their validity.\nSix years later, in November 2007, the ANASE report was published. It concluded\nthat our tolerance of aircraft noise was decreasing; that similar volumes of noise\nannoy us more now than they used to. For a government considering, for example,\nthe need for a third runway at Heathrow, this was not good news.\nThe report\u2019s \u2018quantitative findings were rejected as unreliable\u2019 [BBC] by the DfT. But\nabout a quarter \u2013 sic \u2013 of the project\u2019s duration had in fact been spent on Expert Peer\nReviews. ANASE\u2019s website\n(http:\/\/www.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/aviation\/environmentalissues\/Anase\/) includes the report, its\ntechnical appendices and several of these critical reviews.\nIn particular, DfT paid two acoustics experts to review the ANASE draft material3.\nTheir comments include:\n\u201c\u2026in the first version of this review it was stated that there were sufficient\ntechnical and methodological uncertainties still remaining with the study to\nmean that reliance on the detailed outcome of ANASE would be misplaced. In\nview of developments since the review of the July 2007 version of the ANASE\nmain report, the reviewers are even more convinced that their concerns are\nfully justified\u2026\u201d\nSo was the Government right to be concerned about the ANASE claims? What were\nthe actual problems found by these Peer Reviewers? We can summarise the main\nANASE claims, and then examine the design, methodology and statistical analyses\nthat its authors set out in their published material.\n2. ANASE\u2019s Claims\nANASE adopted several basic ideas from its predecessor, ANIS. It used social\nsurvey questionnaires to elicit respondents\u2019 annoyance from aircraft noise. It studied\nfifty-six survey sites near nine airports, with levels of noise from 36 to 68 Leq. The\nstudy report makes a number of aircraft annoyance claims, including these (slightly\nedited):\nClaim: \u201cFor the same amount of aircraft noise, measured in Leq, people are\nmore annoyed in 2005 than they were in 1982.\u201d\nClaim: \u201cThe modelling work also showed that respondents were less sensitive\nto changes in sound level below 42 Leq and above 59 Leq, adding support to\na logistic dose-response form [dose = noise measure, response = annoyance].\nThere was no threshold, or discontinuity, in the relationship between mean\nannoyance and Leq.\u201d\nA third claim was that Leq itself was a faulty guide to measuring noise:\n3Claim: \u201cThe results \u2026 suggest that Leq gives insufficient weight to aircraft\nnumbers, and a relative weight of 20 appears more supportable from the\nevidence than a weight of 10, as implied by the Leq formulation.\u201d\nThese are dramatic claims. To meet the DfT criterion that they should \u2018command the\nwidest possible confidence\u2019, they would need to be robust, technically reliable, and\ncapable of withstanding scrutiny. But were the ANASE claims actually strong enough\nto do that?\n3. ANASE Problems: Questionnaire\nWhen carrying out an attitudinal survey, you have to make choices about how you\nword the questions, the context in which you ask them, the scales you assign to the\nanswers you get, and your data collection technique. But all these choices can\ngenerate errors and biases. The responses to attitudinal questions may easily be\naffected by the way the issue is posed, the order of the questions, the particular\nwording of a key question and its context.\nPsychologists interpret attitudes as \u2018structures in long-term memory\u2019. They suggest\nthat when we are asked about our attitudes, we go through a four-stage cognitive\nprocess before we arrive at an answer:\n(i) Interpret the question (\u201cWhat is the attitude about?\u201d).\n(ii) Retrieve relevant beliefs\/feelings.\n(iii) Apply these beliefs\/feelings to generate appropriate judgement.\n(iv) Use this judgement to formulate response.\nThis indicates that attitudes are not some kind of enduring personal view, just waiting\nto be picked out of someone\u2019s mind. Instead, they are \u2018evaluative judgements\u2019\nformed at a particular time \u2013 and formed both by the questions that are being asked,\nand the way in which they are being asked.\nThus, attitude reports \u2013 how people \u2018feel\u2019 about certain subjects \u2013 are highly context\nsensitive. All four stages above can potentially be affected by \u2018prior items\u2019: serious\nrespondents may be building on their earlier thought processes, or they may aim to\n\u2018match\u2019 the earlier responses and be consistent with their answers. They are unlikely\nto want to mislead about their \u2018true\u2019 attitudes, but they may be motivated to provide\nanswers showing that they are aware of the issues about which they are to be\nquestioned.\nThe message is clear: to make valid comparisons of attitudes over time, you have to\nask exactly the same questions in the same at each time point. This is standard\ntextbook guidance4 repeated by (eg) the UK Government Social Research Unit\n[GSRU]5 and in NHS research guidelines6. So, if ANASE wanted to find how our\nattitudes to noise had changed since 1982, it should have asked the same questions,\nin the same context, as were asked in 1982. It did not.\nFigure 1 shows a schematic comparison of the ANIS and ANASE questionnaire set-\nups. Two potential context effects are:\nANASE installed noise playback equipment in people\u2019s homes before\ninterviewing them; ANIS did not. Thus, ANIS is a social survey and ANASE is\n4a combination of a social survey and a laboratory experiment \u2013 later in the\ninterview, noises are played to respondents.\nANASE starts immediately with questions on aircraft noise annoyance; but\nANIS leads up to them by asking first about perceptions of the local area,\nhence allowing the interviewee to mention aircraft noise spontaneously.\nBoth of these factors could affect annoyance ratings considerably. And other factors\ncan have a major impact too \u2013 such as recent media attention on an airport\u2019s\npossible growth, and people\u2019s trust in both the airport company and in national\/local\nairport government policies. .\n5. ANASE Problems: Annoyance Measure\nThe ANASE contractors\u2019 way of using annoyance scales is odd. First, compare the\nquestions that ask a respondent how much he or she is annoyed:\nANIS ANASE\nExtremely?Very much?\nVery?\nHighly\nAnnoyed?\nModerately? Moderately?\nA little? Slightly?\nNot at all? Not at all?\nNote that the ANIS version has no middle ranking choice \u2013 so the interviewee is not\nable to take the \u2018easy way out\u2019 by choosing \u2018in the middle\u2019. For the ANASE version,\nthe combination of \u2018Very\u2019 and \u2018Extremely\u2019 answers is taken as a \u2018Highly Annoyed\u2019\ncategory. The ANASE reports did not offer evidence-based reasons for the change.\nThere is no perfect recipe for determining \u2018good\u2019 attitude scales, but the key question\nis the extent to which a possible scale is cardinal in nature (ie corresponding to the\nproperties of integers), rather than just being \u2018ordinal\u2019 (ranking responses). If a scale\nis cardinal, then such results can be manipulated by all the rules of arithmetic, and\nhence analysed by the standard kinds of statistical testing.\nANIS used the responses above to construct a \u2018Very Much Annoyed Percentage\u2019\nscale of annoyance at each survey site. The ANIS choice of scale is consistent with\nthe great bulk of world-wide research on aircraft disturbance (eg Fidell & Silvati7, a\nrecent international review paper of social survey data into aircraft noise annoyance).\nIn contrast, ANASE used the answers to its version of the annoyance question to\nconstruct a \u2018Mean Annoyance\u2019. In its scheme, a rating of \u2018Not at all\u2019 scored 10 points,\nof \u2018Slightly\u2019 scored 30 points\u2019, up to \u2018Extremely\u2019 scoring 90 points; ie each extra level\nof annoyance added twenty points. The Mean Annoyance estimate for the site was\nthen simply the arithmetic average of the respondents\u2019 scores, eg if half the people\nsaid \u2018Not at all\u2019 and half the people said \u2018Extremely\u2019, this would be a mean of 50\npoints.\nBut ANASE\u2019s choices of weightings are subjective value judgements. The ANASE\ncontractors did not produce robust evidence to justify the relative numerical scorings\n5(saying the scale is \u2018standardised\u2019 adds no content). Why are nine people saying\n\u2018Not at all\u2019 equivalent to one person saying \u2018Extremely\u2019, or to three people saying\n\u2018Slightly\u2019? Rather than 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90, the analysis could have used any\nother set of increasing numbers \u2013 and that would have changed the inferences they\nmade.\nArbitrarily averaged attitude scales, with their unreliable statistical properties, were\nused very cautiously even before the ANIS work. It is puzzling why ANASE would\nneed to change from the ANIS percentage scales, of how many were Very much\nannoyed, how many Moderately, and so on. But even when we analyse ANASE in\npercentage terms, so that it is comparable with ANIS and international work,\nproblems remain.\n6. ANASE Problems: Statistical Analysis\nANASE used two kinds of survey sites. At one (\u2018Full\u2019) there was the noise playback\nequipment of Figure 1, and at the other (\u2018Restricted\u2019) there was no equipment. Thus,\nthe context for the two was markedly different. If context effects are crucial in this\nstudy, then marked differences would be expected in the data from the two kinds of\nsites \u2013 and they are there.\nFigure 2 shows the \u2018% Highly Annoyed\u2019 response for the two site types at the 27\nANASE Heathrow sites. The Heathrow sites are selected because of the availability\nof CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] \/ DfT higher accuracy Leq values for these sites;\nbecause it is straightforward to approximate internationally-used DNL values (by\nadding 2.5 to the Leq value); and to avoid airport-dependent factors. [DNL is the\nDay-Night Average Sound Level used in the USA and several other countries: it is a\n24-hour Leq with night flight noise levels artificially increased by 10 decibels.] Simple\nlinear-fit trend lines are also shown for the two sets of data.\nFigure 2 indicates that the Full and Restricted scatter plots and trends are very\nprobably different \u2013 in particular the trend line slopes differ. In comparing two\nregression lines, the most basic hypothesis to test is the hypothesis of coincidence,\nie if the two underlying relationships are the same. The ANASE contractors carried\nout statistical testing to compare Heathrow Full and Restricted data \u2013 but only at the\ninstigation of the reviewers3. This rejected the coincidence hypothesis, finding that\nthe differences were statistically significant (t-statistic above the standard 5% level).\nIt is therefore unlikely that the two samples come from the same underlying\npopulation. It implies that the introduction of noise equipment changed the aircraft\nnoise annoyance dose-response relationship, by a roughly multiplicative bias. The\nANASE contractors decided to ignore these crucial results.\nOnly in circumstances when statistical testing accepts coincidence, as examined\nthrough (eg) Analysis of Variance techniques, is it permissible to fit a single overall\nregression line to both relationships. But the ANASE statistical analysis wrongly\ncombines Full and Restricted data sets (eg Figure 3). To ignore the statistical testing\nresults rejecting the coincidence of the data sets is not sound practice. It is the kind\nof thing that a statistical textbook would offer as an example of \u2018how to do it\nincorrectly\u2019. It removes any sound foundations for subsequent ANASE modelling\nclaims about (eg) annoyance onsets and the weighting of the number of aircraft.\n6Why do the Full and Restricted data sets differ? It is not possible to offer precise\nreasons based on the ANASE documents, simply because the ANASE work did not\ninvestigate potential causes. One factor could be confusion between hearing and\/or\nbeing aware of noise as compared with suffering a degree of annoyance. The\npresence, and presumed intended use of the noise playback equipment, is certainly\na possible strong factor.\nAn even more telling illustration is a mapping of the Heathrow data in Figure 2 onto\nthe Fidell & Silvati7 data set \u2013 Figure 4. This aircraft annoyance research collated\ninternational data from 326 site surveys with an average of about 160 people per site.\nThe Figure shows a scatter plot of all the \u2018% Highly Annoyed\u2019 data against DNL. The\ntwo trend lines are the linear fits to the Fidell & Silvati data and the ANASE Heathrow\nFull data. The ANASE Heathrow Restricted data lies roughly on the Fidell & Silvati\ntrend line. The ANASE Heathrow Full data lies markedly above the trend line for the\nother data: it is hard to believe that it is a sample from the same underlying\npopulation.\nFigure 5 shows the complete set of Full and Restricted data from ANASE (using\nwholly ANASE data). This again shows that there are differences between the two\ndata sets: having noise equipment present does make a difference \u2013 showing a\nroughly multiplicative bias at the Full sites. The Figure also shows that ANASE\nRestricted sites were not wisely selected. The onus was on the ANASE contractors\nto select sites to be able to test effectively for Full\/Restricted differences \u2013 Restricted\nsites at higher Leq values (\u2018control group sites\u2019) should therefore have been included.\nFigure 6 compares the \u2018% Highly Annoyed data\u2019 from all the Restricted sites with a\ncurve fitted to the ANIS results used in policy work3 (Fidell and Silvati7 discuss curve-\nfitting). The ANASE Restricted data points are possibly slightly above the ANIS\ncurve, but this could be a statistical sampling issue (Restricted site ANASE samples\nwere very small, typically 16 people) and\/or a context effects-related problem \u2013\nbecause of a markedly different questionnaire ordering and a different annoyance\nquestion.\n7. ANASE Problems: International Comparisons over Time\nThere are comments in the ANASE reports that allude to non-UK studies suggesting\nthat the annoyance dose-response relationship might be moving upwards, ie people\nare typically more annoyed for a given Leq. This is not a new suggestion1. The test\nof this kind of hypothesis is to examine data.\nAs already noted, an excellent recent review paper is Fidell & Silvati7. Figure 7\nextracts results from the Fidell & Silvati data set. It shows responses in the bands\n47.5-52.5, 52.5-57.5, and 57.5-62.5; ie these represent ~50, ~55 and ~60 DNL. The\nplots cover results after 1980, mainly because the interest is in changes since the\nearly 1980s ANIS work. The Figure plots these responses against the year the\nsurvey was published. Simple (unweighted) linear regressions on the data in the\nFigure \u2013 the trend lines \u2013 do not show significant changes over time (none of the\nregression t-statistics is significant at even the 10% level). Thus, there is no strong\nevidence from this large international data set of any trend over time.\n7A simple analysis on even this large data set is not statistical proof. To be confident\nabout the magnitude of possible trends over time, it would be necessary to carry out\nhigh-quality data collections and statistical analyses, with tight experimental controls\non questionnaire context\/design, annoyance scales, socio-economic variables, media\nattention\/trust, and sampling variations.\n8. Summary\nThe DfT was wise to commission the peer reviews and to publish the material rather\nthan be accused of a \u2018cover up\u2019. But no reliance can be put on ANASE claims: they\ncannot \u2018command the widest possible confidence\u2019. There are unrepairable major\nproblems with questionnaire design and process, analysis techniques, and selective\nattempts to compare with international work.\nThe design of the ANASE questionnaire does not meet the necessary criteria set out\nin standard textbooks, by the Treasury\u2019s GSRU, or responsible UK organisations (eg\nthe NHS). This damages the ability to make reliable comparisons with earlier work.\nThe analysis techniques used in ANASE do not recognise the problems of using\naverage annoyance scales in parametric statistical analyses. ANASE\u2019s contractors\npresented no good reasons for changing from earlier, robust scales, inter alia\npreventing proper comparisons.\nANASE fails to meet minimum data analysis requirements for such a study, ie critical\nexamination of raw data to detect potential biases, and always taking proper account\nof statistical testing results. The regression-based statistical modelling used in\nANASE is invalid because it too quickly combines data from Full and Restricted (ie\nwithout noise playback equipment) sites samples. This also reveals ANASE\u2019s poor\ndesign: the onus was on the contractors to test key hypotheses on these effects \u2013\nthere are insufficient Restricted \u2018control group\u2019 sites.\nANASE data suggest that the introduction of noise equipment changes the aircraft\nnoise annoyance dose-response relationship by a roughly multiplicative bias factor \u2013\nbut no points are awarded for measuring the wrong thing, accurately or not. ANASE\ndata for Full sites are markedly out of line with the results of reputable international\nand previous UK work. As data from ANASE\u2019s Full sites are unlikely to be\nrepresentative of people\u2019s annoyance attitudes, the SP results that build from these\ndistorted attitudes may similarly be distorted. ANASE Restricted site data are\nbroadly consistent with international and ANIS results.\nThus, a straightforward factual explanation for the ANASE data set is that it has a\ndesign-induced multiplicative bias overlaying annoyance responses largely\nunchanged from past studies. The implication is that the ANASE contractors\u2019 claims\n\u2013 eg increased annoyance over time, additional aircraft number effects \u2013 are invalid\nbecause they mostly derive from the biased data.\n8References\n1 Brooker, P.
