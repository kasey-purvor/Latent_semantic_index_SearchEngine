INTRODUCTION \n \nlectric vehicles are set to play a prominent role in \naddressing the energy and environmental impact of \nan increasing road transport population by offering a \nmore energy efficient and less polluting drive-train \nalternative to conventional internal combustion engine \n(ICE) vehicles.  Whilst there are many technical and \nresource management issues associated with the \ndisplacement of petroleum fuels for transportation, and \nthe commensurate fuel supply infrastructure, this paper \nwill discuss the application of electro-chemical batteries, \nsupercapacitors and fuel cells in single and hybrid \nenergy sources for electric vehicle traction systems. \nFor road vehicle applications, the on-board energy and \npower sources must satisfy the load demand of the \nvehicle traction drive-train.  The decision as to whether \nthe on-board energy source supplies all of the vehicle \nload or simply the average energy requirements, via a \nhybrid configuration utilising a power buffer, can \nsignificantly influence the sizing of the vehicle \nenergy\/power storage system and hence total drive \nsystem cost.  The difficulty in making this assessment is \nin choosing the most appropriate duty rating \nspecification for the vehicle [1,2]. For example, Fig. 1(a) \nillustrates the Fiat Electtra, a typical small 1.5 tonne \nurban electric vehicle that will be used as the reference \nvehicle throughout the paper.  Fig. 1(b) illustrates the \nNEDC vehicle driving cycle comprising of four \nEuropean Commission R15.04 urban (ECE15) and one \nEC sub-urban velocity profile, whilst Fig. 1(c) illustrates \nthe dynamic power required to propel the Fiat Electtra \nover the NEDC driving cycle.  The vehicle average \n(energy) and peak power over the NEDC cycle are \ntabulated in Table I together with results for the same \nvehicle when considering the highway fuel economy test \nschedule (HWFET), US 1975 driving schedule (FTP75) \nand Japanese 11-mode test schedule (J11).  Two \noperating scenarios are considered, one with, and one \nwithout the recovery of regenerative braking energy.  \nNote, that whilst all sources are a source of energy to \nsome greater or lesser degree, reference is made here to \nenergy and power to emphasise the functionality of the \nvehicle sources with respect to the vehicle energy \nmanagement philosophy, the objective of which, for \nhybrid source configurations, is to realise optimum \nutilisation of the on-board energy and power dense \nsources. \nFrom Table I, it can be seen that there is a wide \ndisparity between vehicle average and peak power \nrequirements, which is typical for urban driving.  Hence, \nspecifying the on-board energy source to satisfy the \ninstantaneous vehicle electrical load can lead to \nsignificant over-sizing with the resulting implications on \nsystem volume, mass and cost.  There are, therefore, \nclear benefits in terms of mass minimisation, energy \nefficiency and the recovery of vehicle regenerative \nbraking energy, for the operation of hybrid energy \nsystem configurations, an example of which is illustrated \nby the generalised vehicle drive-train schematic of Fig. \n2, showing various options for energy storage devices, \npeak power buffers and their associated interconnection, \nfor a series electrical drive-train implementation.  Here, \nthe energy source may provide the traction drive DC-\nlink with the peak power buffer interfaced via a DC:DC \nconverter (Option I), or alternatively, the peak power \nbuffer may provide the DC-link with the energy source \ninterfaced via a DC:DC converter (Option II). \nThe exploitation of the disparity in vehicle peak and \naverage power requirement is at the core of hybrid-\nelectric vehicle operational philosophy, particularly \nwhere the energy source is an ICE and the goal is to \nE\n0-7803-9280-9\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE. 42\n reduce engine size and hence improve on emissions and \nfuel economy.  A number of authors [3-6] have showed \nthat by choosing a single energy source, the source tends \nto be oversized.  Additionally, for single source systems, \nthere are limitations on vehicle dynamic performance in \nterms of responsive braking and the recovery of vehicle \nregenerative energy.  This paper confirms these findings \nand investigates the optimisation of hybrid sources by \nconsidering two case studies for the reference vehicle of \nFig. 1, viz.: \n\u2022 an electro-chemical battery (lead-acid) and \nsupercapacitor combination, and \n\u2022 a hydrogen PEM fuel cell and supercapacitor \ncombination. \n \n \n \n \nCurb Weight 1200 kg\nPay Load    300 kg\nGross Vehicle Weight                       1500 kg\nDrag Coefficient  CD    0.3\nFrontal Area   Af                                 2.0 m2\nRolling Resistance Coefficient kr        0.01  \n(a)  Urban electric vehicle \u2013 the FIAT Electtra \n(b) Vehicle reference driving cycle \u2013 the NEDC \n(c) Vehicle power requirements  \nFig. 1.  Urban electric vehicle data and typical power requirements \nfor urban and sub-urban driving. \n \nAs a benchmark, the default on-board energy system \nfor the reference electric vehicle is based on 18 Hawker, \nGenesis EP Series, 70Ah-12V lead-acid (Pb-acid) \nbatteries scaled to 80.7Ah-12V, and 128 Maxwell \nPC2500 supercapacitors.  The total mass and volume for \nthe benchmark energy system is 602.5kg and 277.4litres \nrespectively.  The mass and volumes include housings, \nconnections, cell and thermal management systems.  \nAlthough the calculated mass data will be indicative of \nan actual vehicle system, the component volumes are \nbased on existing prototype bench-test systems and are, \nas a consequence, non-optimal.  For future vehicle \napplications the design of vehicle specific, non-regular \nshape components, could lead to improved volumetric \npackaging.  Hence, for this study, the total maximum \nenergy source mass is fixed while two scenarios are \nconsidered for volume, one being related to maximum \nmass and the other to the benchmark system volume, the \nassumption being that any future energy source would \nlie between these two design extremes.  The energy \nsource interconnection was chosen as Option I of Fig.2, \nwhere it is assumed that the power buffer energy \nmanagement realises a 90% utilisation of the of power \nbuffer (i.e. supercapacitor) energy spectrum.  The system \nDC:DC converter is modelled with a high efficiency \n(>90%) details of which may be found in [7]. \n \nTable I.

Simulation models \n A major operational problem associated with most \nelectro-chemical traction batteries, and lead-acid \nbatteries in particular, is their degradation in \nperformance at high current discharge\/charge rates, \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nTime (s)\nV\neh\nicl\ne \nv\nel\noc\nity\n \n(k\nm\n\/h\n)\n \n4x ECE15 profiles Sub-urban profile \n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nTime (s)\nPo\nw\ner\n \n(k\nW\n)\n43\n typical of vehicle acceleration and braking demands \n[8,9].  For example, repetitive high power demands, \neven for a short duration (2-3s), can limit battery energy \nutilisation due to battery voltage regulation, as will be \nshown later.  More importantly, high cyclic operation \nreduces battery life adding a significant premium to the \noperating costs of an electric vehicle.  The incorporation \nof a peak power buffer into an electric vehicle drive-\ntrain can reduce the peak power load on the primary \nenergy source, resulting in a significant improvement in \nbattery energy utilisation due to levelling of the battery \nenergy demand.  Additionally, the response of the \nvehicle is more consistent when accelerating and \nbraking, and the recovery of vehicle kinetic energy \nduring braking enhanced, since the drive-train energy \nmanagement is independent of the traction battery state-\nof-charge (SOC) or terminal voltage. \nSimulation of the battery and battery-supercapacitor \ncombination is facilitated via a detailed analytic model \nof the two technologies validated via test data taken \nfrom a vehicle drive-train platform [1].  The battery \nmodel implements a detailed non-linear characteristic of \nboth discharge and charging resistance to model \nperformance during these regimes.  The characteristics \nare based in experimental results taken during the \ncharacterisation of Hawker Genesis 70Ah-12V sealed \nlead-acid batteries.  The SC system comprises of 128 \nseries connected, 2500F, 2.5V nominal, Maxwell \nPC2500 SCs, which are modelled as a simple R-C \ncircuit, R being the device leakage resistance and C the \ncapacitance, as taken from manufacturer\u2019s data sheets \n[10] and validated by bench test. \nSince the battery loadings are relatively low frequency \n(<100Hz for the NEDC), the battery equivalent circuit \nmodel can be simplified to that illustrated in Fig. 3(a).  \nThe open-circuit terminal voltage of the battery depends \non battery SOC, and is found from test to be independent \nof load current, Fig. 3(b).  SOC is defined as a ratio of \ncharge left in the battery, with respect to a specified \nmaximum charge capacity taken from the \nmanufacturer\u2019s nameplate capacity and collaborated via \na series of Peukert tests.  Both the discharging and \ncharging internal resistances are determined from test \nand are a function of the battery SOC and \ndischarging\/charging current rate, Fig. 3(c) and 3(d) \nrespectively.  The main specification details of the \nHawker Pb-acid battery and Maxwell supercapacitor are \ngiven in Appendix I.  Note, that the Pb-acid battery \nmodel is based on an ambient cooling temperature of \n20\u00b0C, which is not unrealistic since, in practice, a \ncooling system would be required for Pb-acid batteries \nto maximise battery energy utilisation.  Hence, the effect \nof higher battery operating temperature would need \nfurther consideration.   \n \nB. Pure battery EV operation \n To illustrate the impact of vehicle load demand on \nbattery performance, the reference vehicle of Fig. 1(a) is \nconsidered driving over repetitive ECE15 and NEDC \nvelocity profiles.  The upper and lower voltage limits of \neach of the lead-acid batteries were set to 16.0V and \n10.2V respectively.  Fig. 4 illustrates an example of \nsimulated and experimental results of battery terminal \nvoltage variation, showing good correlation and \ndemonstrating the utility of the battery model over \ndynamic load profiles commensurate with vehicle \noperation. \nEoc\nRint\nVterminalEoc fn (SOC)\n \n(a) Equivalent circuit model for lead-acid battery \n10.5\n11.0\n11.5\n12.0\n12.5\n13.0\n13.5\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nNormalised battery SOC\nO\npe\nn\n-\nc\nir\nc\nu\nit\n \nv\no\nlta\nge\n \npe\nr\n \nba\ntt\ne\nr\ny \n\/ V\n \n(b) Open circuit terminal voltage \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nNormalised battery SOC\nR\ne\nsi\nst\na\nn\nc\ne\n \npe\nr\n \nba\ntt\ne\nr\ny \n\/ m\n\u2126\u2126 \u2126\u2126\n7A 14A 28A 42A\n84A 133A 175A\n \n(c) Discharging internal resistance \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nNormalised battery SO C\nR\ne\nsi\nst\na\nn\nc\ne\n \npe\nr\n \nba\ntt\ne\nr\ny \n\/ m\n\u2126\u2126 \u2126\u2126\n7A 14A 42A\n84A 133A 175A\n \n(d) Charging internal resistance \nFig. 3.

Simulated and measured battery terminal voltage for pure \nelectric vehicle operation. \n \nFig. 5 illustrates the battery terminal voltages for both \ndriving cycles from full battery SOC to the point when \nthe minimum set-point voltage of 10.2V (per battery) is \nreached.  Note, the upper voltage transients occur during \nregenerative braking and the lower voltage transients \nduring peak acceleration.  These lower voltage transients \nultimately limit battery energy utilisation to 0.43 and \n0.44 SOC, for Case 1 and 3 respectively, by virtue of the \nbattery management system (which monitors the 16.0V \nand 10.2V limits). \nFor repetitive cycling of the dynamic load profiles \nconsidered, the battery is capable of supplying energy \nequating to a vehicle range of 68.6km for the urban \nECE15 and 60.5km for the NEDC, the reduction due to \nthe additional energy demand of the sub-urban profile of \nthe NEDC.   \n \nC. Battery-supercapacitor hybrid \n The driving regimes considered for the pure electric \nscenario are now applied to the lead-acid battery-\nsupercapacitor hybrid energy source configuration, and \nthe battery capacity and SC rating are optimised to \nminimise battery peak current while maximising vehicle \nrange.  Calculated performance data is given in Table II \nfor comparison with the pure EV solutions, Cases 1 and \n3.  Referring to Case 1 and 2 of Table II, it can be \nobserved that there is an improvement in range for urban \ndriving due to the better utilisation of the on-board \nbattery energy source, from 0.43 to 0.17 SOC due, \nprimarily, to a reduction of battery peak current (242 to \n55A) and hence a reduction in transient voltage drop at \nthe battery terminals facilitated by the vehicle energy \nmanagement that tries to maintain a low battery current \nby utilising the SC power buffer during drive-train \ntransients. \n For the NEDC cycle there is no improvement in range \nfor the hybrid energy source, Case 4, since the sub-urban \nelement of the driving cycle is energy demanding.  \nHowever, utilising the battery and SC specifications \noptimised for the ECE15 cycle, Case 2, does lead to a \nreduction in peak battery current \u2013 an important feature \nfor battery life, and also in Ah specification, Case 4.  \nOptimising the energy sources for the NEDC cycle \nyields a slightly smaller battery capacity and SC than for \nthe urban case.  This combination yields a reduced peak \nbattery current and a range improvement of 12%  \nHence, the inclusion of a peak power buffer enables \nthe electric vehicle primary energy source to be operated \nfor a longer period before the battery terminal voltage \nreaches the minimum limit imposed by the battery \nmanagement system.  The reduced transient battery \ncurrent improves battery lifetime, although this is not \nevaluated here.  Furthermore, the hybrid configuration \nhas the potential of improving overall energy efficiency \nsince the SC has a much higher discharge\/charge \nefficiency when compared to a lead-acid battery [11]. \n \n (a) ECE15; Case 1, battery alone \n(b) NEDC, Case 3, battery alone  \nFig. 5.

FUEL CELL AND SUPERCAPACITOR SYSTEMS \n \nA.  Background \nA major advantage of fuel cell powered vehicles is the \ndevelopment of cleaner, more energy efficient cars, \ntrucks, and buses that can initially operate on \nconventional fuels, i.e. gasoline and diesel, whilst \nenabling drive-train technologies for a future move to \nrenewable and alternative fuels, i.e. methanol, ethanol, \nnatural gas, and other hydro-carbons, and ultimately \nhydrogen, a particularly significant issue when \nconsidering the infrastructure and support requirements \nof a modern transportation network.  With on-board \nfuels other than pure hydrogen, for example, natural gas, \nmethanol and gasoline, the fuel cell systems could use an \nappropriate fuel processor to convert the fuel to \nhydrogen.  Since the fuel cell relies on chemistry and not \ncombustion, emissions from this type of a system \nshould, potentially, be much smaller than emissions \nfrom the cleanest fuel combustion process emissions, \nwhilst offering the advantages of an electric \ntransmission.  However, disadvantages of fuel cells in \ntraction systems is their voltage regulation and inability \nto accept vehicle kinetic energy during braking, hence \nthe consideration of a hybrid energy source. \n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nCurrent density \/ Acm -2\nA\nve\nra\nge\n v\nol\nta\nge\n p\ner\n c\nel\nl \/\n V\n0.00\n0.07\n0.14\n0.21\n0.28\n0.35\n0.42\n0.49\n0.56\n0.63\n0.70\nPo\nw\ner\n o\nut\npu\nt p\ner\n c\nel\nl \/\nW\ncm\nVoltage\nPower\n-2\nActivation polarisation\n(reaction rate loss)\nConcentration polarisation\n(gas transport loss)\nOhmic polarisation\n(resistance loss)\nPeak power\n \nFig. 6.

Measured fuel cell stack hydrogen-to-electrical energy \nefficiency with output load. \nB.  Fuel cell model \n As with electro-chemical batteries, fuel cells exhibit \nnon-linear performance characteristics that can \nsignificantly influence vehicle drive system operation \nand component optimisation if not considered at the \nsystem design stage.  For example, the three main fuel \ncell (FC) loss mechanisms, activation, concentration and \nohmic or resistance polarisation loss, all influence FC \nperformance, as illustrated in Fig. 6 [12,13], showing \nmeasured H2 PEM FC system polarisation and power \ndensity curves for load current density [14].  Fig. 7 \nillustrates the measured fuel cell stack hydrogen-to-\nelectrical energy efficiency with output load.  Since the \nfuel cell considered is operated at a near fixed inlet \npressure and the stack temperature closely regulated, the \nfuel cell characteristics of Figs. 6 and 7 are sufficient to \nmodel the fuel cell for on-vehicle simulation.  Suitable \ncurve fits to the characteristics are made such that the \nmodel can be implemented analytically to reduce \ncomputation time.   \n \nTable III.

System studies. \n For a vehicle supplied solely via fuel cells, \noperation at low cell current densities would be required \nto minimise the voltage regulation of the dc supply to the \nvehicle traction system, Fig. 6.  To address the FC \nvoltage regulation and regenerative limitations, a FC-SC \nhybrid energy source is considered, with the respective \ncomponent specifications evaluated over repetitive \nECE15 and NEDC driving cycles.  Note, the time-\ntransient response of the FC fuelling has to be \nconsidered at the design stage, a feature that also fosters \noperation in a hybrid energy source configuration.   \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime \/ s\nPo\nw\ner\n \/ \nkW\n \n(a) FC output power vs. time \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0 50 100 150 200\nTime \/ s\nEf\nfic\nie\nn\ncy\n \n\/ n\n.\nu\n.\n \n(b) FC efficiency vs. time \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nCurrent density \/ A cm-2\nPo\nw\ner\n d\nen\nsi\nty\n \/ \nW\n c\nm-\n2\n \n(c) FC output power vs. current density \n \nFor the study, the battery benchmark reference is used \nas the default energy system mass and volume, with \nconnection Option I of Fig. 2 chosen to maximise the SC \nenergy.  Also, two different storage cylinder pressures \nare considered, i.e. 230bar and 700bar, based on current \nstate-of-art and projected future storage pressures \nrespectively [15].  An assumption is made that the mass \nand volume for the 700bar storage is as for the 230bar \nsystem.  However, it must be noted that hydrogen gas is \nnot an ideal gas; the energy content at 700bar is not \nlinearly proportional to 230bar.  For the same volume, \nthe 700bar cylinder contains only 2.35x the hydrogen \nenergy of a 230bar cylinder [15]. \n  \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nTime \/ s\nPo\nw\ner\n \/ \nkW\n \n(a) FC output power vs. time \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nTime \/ s\nEf\nfic\nie\nn\ncy\n \n\/ n\n.\nu\n.\n \n(b) FC efficiency vs. time \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nCurrent density \/ A cm-2\nPo\nw\ner\n d\nen\nsi\nty\n \/ \nW\n c\nm\n-2\n \n(c) FC output power vs. current density \nFig. 9.  44.5kW FC system simulation results over NEDC. \n \nFor a pure fuel cell powered vehicle an installed fuel \ncell output power capability of 44.5kW is required.  It \ncan be seen that the fuel cell volume alone already \nexceeds the volume of the battery benchmark energy \nsource, exclusive of any gas storage cylinders, Case 1 of \n47\n Table III.  Hence, it will be assumed that the energy \nsource volumetric requirement will be satisfied by future \ncomponent integration and volume design optimisation.  \nConsequently, range is calculated for the ECE15 and \nNEDC cycles, Cases 1 of Table IV, for both hydrogen \nstorage pressures.  Fig. 8 illustrates simulation results for \na pure fuel cell vehicle on the ECE15 driving cycle, \nshowing the simulated fuel cell output power (a), \nhydrogen-to-electrical efficiency (b) and fuel cell power \noutput vs. stack current density (c) - highlighting the \npoor utilisation of the fuel cell stack.  Similarly, Fig. 9 \nillustrates results for the pure fuel cell vehicle over the \nNEDC cycle.  The quoted figures fuel cell average \nefficiency of Table IV are the average hydrogen-to-\nelectrical efficiency over the respective driving cycle. \n If the fuel cell rating is chosen to provide the drive-\nsystem average energy, the fuel cell mass can be reduced \nconsiderably as shown in Table III, Cases 2 to 5.  \nHowever, the required supercapacitor peak power buffer \nincreases the overall energy source mass and volume.  \nAs a direct comparison to the pure fuel cell vehicle, a \nFC-supercapacitor hybrid energy source can \nsignificantly improve vehicle range for urban driving, by \na factor of 3.2 for the ECE15, Case 2.  However, as with \nthe battery-SC hybrid, range is only marginally \nimproved for the NEDC cycle, Case 4, although for a \nmuch reduced energy source volume as a consequence \nof the higher achievable average energy efficiency and \nthe recovery of regenerative energy.  If the calculated \nrange of 561km for Case 4 is acceptable, Case 5 \ninvestigates the achievable reduction in cylinder mass \nand volume for the high pressure storage scenario. \nAn interesting case arises for the ECE15 cycle due to \nthe high peak-to-average duty rating.  This disparity can \nbe exploited allowing a reduced hydrogen storage \nvolume and hence reduced total energy source volume, \nto an extent that equates to the battery vehicle \nbenchmark specification, Case 3 of Tables III and IV.  \nHere, the energy source mass is also reduced to 21% that \nof the benchmark vehicle, whilst vehicle range is \nincreased by 2.4 or 5.8 times that of the battery vehicle \ndepending upon storage pressure.

CONCLUSIONS \n \n The paper has investigated the application of electro-\nchemical batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells in \nsingle and hybrid source configurations for electric \nvehicle drive-train applications.  Simulation models of \nenergy sources have been presented and used to \ninvestigate the design optimisation of electric vehicle \non-board energy source in terms of energy efficiency \nand storage mass\/volume in the form of case studies \nconsidering a typical small urban electric vehicle.  The \nmodels and approach can be applied to other vehicles \nand driving regimes. \nThe study results illustrate the benefits of hybrid \nenergy sources in terms of energy source mass, vehicle \nrange and system functionality i.e. (i) the recovery or \nregenerative energy, (ii) the reduction of battery current \nloading (iii) the improvement of fuel cell energy \nconversion efficiency and (iv) the separation of drive-\ntrain transients from the main energy source to the \nsystem power buffer.   \n The results highlight the limitations of battery \nvehicles in terms or range, though the battery-SC energy \nsource would be ideal for urban specific driving, for \nexample city delivery \/ postal applications.  The fuel cell \nhybrid concept looks promising in terms or vehicle range \nbeing comparable with existing combustion engine \nvehicles.  Although the volumetric challenges of \nintegrated energy sources need to be addressed by future \nvehicle system designers.  \nNon of the preceding discussion has considered cost, \nwhich is ultimately the dominant consideration from an \nautomotive prospective, since both fuel cells and \nsupercapacitors are at an early stage of technical \ndevelopment and cost projections for high volume \napplication vary considerably.  However, the \noptimisation procedure employed can be extended to \ninclude cost functions, although this is outside the scope \nof this paper. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n The authors acknowledge the support of the UK \nEngineering and Physical Science Research Council \n(EPSRC), via Grant No. GR\/S81971\/01; SEMELAB \nPLC, UK, for provision of a research studentship and \nBeta R&D, Derby, UK, for provision of test data and \ntechnical information. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] \u201cEnergy optimised traction system for electric vehicle \n(OPTELEC)\u201d, Project funded by the EC under Framework IV, \nProject No. BE97-4502. \n[2] N.
