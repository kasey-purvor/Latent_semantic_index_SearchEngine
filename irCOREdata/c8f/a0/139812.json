The overall objective was to \nassess the behaviour of the bacterial community in relation to each substrate while treating \nhigh strength landfill leachates. Denitrification processes in fixed bed reactors were \nsimulated at laboratory scale using anaerobic batch tests with immature compost and pine \nbark. High strength leachate was simulated using a solution of water and nitrate at a \nconcentration of 500 mg l\n-1\n. Results suggest that pine bark released large amounts of \nphenolic compounds and hydroxylated benzene rings, which both can delay the \nacclimatization time and inhibit the biological denitrification (only 30% efficiency). \nFurthermore, presence of potential pathogens like Enterobacter and Pantoea agglomerans  \nprevents the applicability of the pine bark in full-scale operations.  On the other hand, \nlightly composted garden refuse (CGR) offered an adequate substrate for the formation of a \nbiofilm necessary to complete the denitrification process (total nitrate removal observed \nwithin 7 days). CGR further contributed to a rapid establishment of an active consortium of \ndenitrifiers including Acinetobacter, Rhizobium, Thermomonas, Rheinheimera, \nPhaeospirillum and Flavobacterium. Clearly the original composition, nature, carbon to \nnitrogen ratio (C\/N) and degree of maturity and stability of the substrates play a key role in \nthe denitrification process, impacting directly on the development of the bacterial \npopulation and, therefore, on the long term removal efficiency.  \n \nKeywords: denitrification; landfill leachate; compost; pine bark; microbial diversity \n 3 \nIntroduction  \nThe majority of municipal solid waste landfills, including those that previously co-disposed \nhazardous materials continue to receive a significant proportion of bioreactive wastes \nwhich produce mainly greenhouse gases and wastewater known as leachate [1]. Landfill \nleachate contains organic and inorganic pollutants including humic acids, ammonia, heavy \nmetals, persistent organic pollutants and inorganic salts at high concentrations (e.g. \nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) between 2000 - 6000 mg l\n-1\n, ammonia between 1000-\n1600 mg l\n-1\n and chloride between 1500-2600 mg l\n-1\n) [2]. If they are not collected carefully \nand not discharged safely, they may become a potential pollution source which threats soil, \nsurface water and groundwater [3]. Therefore, landfill leachate is recognized as an \nimportant environmental problem by modern societies.  In the treatment of landfill leachate, \nbiological systems such as nitrification-denitrification processes are frequently used [4-6]. \nEven though, these systems ensure a high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal \nefficiency, they are usually insufficient in degrading high-molecular-weight fractions and \ndecolouring, and their efficiency is often susceptible to the presence of toxic substances and \npresence of refractory organics such as humic acids and surfactants [7]. In old sanitary \nlandfills, the amount of organic materials having high molecular weight in leachate is high \n[7]. In the treatment of these wastewaters, therefore, combined systems including many \nprocesses such as aerobic\u2013anaerobic decomposition, chemical oxidation, coagulation\u2013\nflocculation and adsorption are preferred to single-process solutions [1]. However these \ncombined treatment processes are often costly in terms of capital investment, energy \nrequirements and frequent use of additional chemicals [1,7]. Other methods such as reverse \nosmosis, active carbon adsorption and advanced oxidation processes have been recently \n 4 \npointed out as more versatile methods, however they only transfer the pollutants without \nsolving the environmental problem and their full-scale application is not often \neconomically feasible [1,8]. Cleary there is a need to re-evaluate the methods to remove \ncontaminants from landfill leachate in order to shift from \u201cwaste treatment\u201d to exploitation \nof landfill leachate as a resource that can be processed for recovery of energy, nutrients and \nother constituents.  \nBiological denitrification is one of the most promising and versatile approaches in the \ntreatment of landfill leachate [7, 8]. In this process, an external organic substrate (i.e. \nmethanol, ethanol, acetic acid) or electron donor is needed [9, 10]. While these compounds \nare expensive and potentially dangerous, some complex substrates such as tree barks, wood \nchips, corncobs, sawdust, compost [11] and newspapers [12] have proved to be efficient \ncarbon sources for denitrification and generally more suited to treat high strength effluents \n[7, 11]. These natural substrates are normally cheaper than the synthetic ones and can be \nderived from a typical waste stream [13, 14]. \nBiological denitrification of landfill leachate is often undertaken in sequencing batch \nreactors (SBR) [7] or in constructed wetlands (CW) [15]. Both treatments are known for \ntheir flexibility in terms of adaptation to leachate nature and collection strategies [16, 17]. \nHowever, the influence that specific substrates have on the development and nature of \nactive microbial populations is not yet widely understood [15]. Indeed, performance and \nstability of a bio-denitrification process, as of any biological process, depend on the \nconcentration of the active species and on their metabolic activity. Little is known about \ntheir diversity, distribution, metabolic potential and functional roles. The nitrate-based \n 5 \nmicrobial communities of which they are members remain uncertain as well as the identity \nof their major and minor players and the ecological parameters that influence \ndenitrification. This information is crucial to better understand the bio-denitrification \nprocess particularly in high strength landfill leachate and for the development of \nknowledge-based technologies to accelerate and optimize this treatment.  \nThe objective of this study was to investigate the influence of garden refuse compost \nand pine bark on the microbial diversity and denitrification activity in the treatment of high \nstrength nitrified landfill leachates (nitrate concentrations ranging between 500 up to 2000 \nmg l\n-1\n). The growth of the microbial community was followed using a spread plate \nenumeration technique; the colonization of the substrates was assessed through \nEnvironmental Scanning Electronic Microscopy (ESEM), and insight into the composition \nof the bacterial community was obtained by phylogenetic analysis.  \n \n1. Materials and methods \n1.1. Leachate selection  \nTo avoid analytical interferences, treated leachate from an SBR was simulated in the \nlaboratory with a synthetic solution of potassium nitrate and distilled water with a \nconcentration of 500 mg l\n-1\n of NO3\n-\n. \n \n1.2. Carbon sources selection \nCommercial (CGR) and domestic (DGR) garden refuse and pine bark (PB) were collected \nat the Mariannhill landfill site, Durban, South Africa. The garden refuse was composted for \n10 weeks in pilot-scale forced aerated vessels at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, \n 6 \nSouth Africa. The properties of the solid substrates were characterized according to \nstandard analytical methods as published by the American Public Health Association [18]: \nmoisture content, total solids, volatile solids, C\/N, Dynamic Respiration Index at 7 days \n(DRI7), determined with an OxiTop\u00ae respirometric system. Eluate tests were conducted to \nassess amount and nature of the compounds leached-out from the substrates in distilled \nwater during 24 hours, using a 10\/1 Liquid to Solid ratio (L\/S) [11]. The following \nparameters were measured: total solids, volatile solids, pH, conductivity (\u03c1), COD, BOD5, \nNH3, NOx and C\/N ratio [18]. All analyses were carried out in triplicate. \n \n1.3. Batch tests \nBatch experiments were designed to study the denitrification patterns of the synthetic \nleachate using the three substrates as carbon sources. Duplicate tests were conducted in 1.5 \nL anaerobic bottles equipped with two airtight silicone septa that allow for continuous \nsampling avoiding air ingress. Each substrate (S) was mixed with the synthetic leachate (L) \nat L\/S=10\/1 to ensure full saturation in the batch reactors (Table 1). As the size distribution \nand consistency of the three substrates were different, and the pine bark chips were reduced \nto 2-3 cm, varying amounts of materials (masses) were used in setting up the reactors, as \nreported in Table 1. A control test with distilled water was also carried out for each \nsubstrate.  Optimal environmental conditions and full liquid to solid transfer were obtained \nby performing the experiments at a controlled temperature of 25 \u00baC and by shaking at 150 \nrpm. The batches were flushed with N2 to set anaerobic conditions.  \nFor nitrate and pH testing, 2 mL samples were collected with a precision syringe connected \n 7 \nto a 0.45 \u03bcm filter after 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min and then every hour during the first day. \nAfterwards, samples were collected four times a day. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations \nwere analyzed using Nitrate Test Sticks type Merckoquant (MERCK). This method was \nselected to avoid large variations of the L\/S ratio with time maintaining a reasonable \naccuracy (error within 10-15%).  1.5 mL samples were taken three times a day with a sterile \nsyringe for microbiological analyses from Batch 1 for each substrate (Fig. 1, 2, and 3). The \nexperiment was stopped when total denitrification was achieved, except for the pine bark \nfor which the final concentration never fell within the discharge limits during the \nexperimental time. The output COD, ammonia and pH were then analyzed on the filtered \neluates. \n \n1.4. Batch inoculation  \nIn order to investigate the effect of inoculation on the reaction rate and the acclimatization \ntime, 5 ml of solution of the first CGR test, were used to inoculate a second CGR batch \nprepared in the same conditions.  \n \n1.5. Semi-quantitative analysis of the bacterial community \nThe effect of the substrates on the growth of the bacterial populations was assessed during \nthe batch tests. The 9215-C spread plate method [18] was applied to enumerate the aerobic \ncultivable microflora. A laminar flow cabinet was used to work in a sterile atmosphere. \nSamples were diluted in sodium chloride solution at 9 g l\n-1\n and 100 \u03bcl of each dilution (10-3 \nto 10\n-7\n) were spread on 90 mm agar plates using the Luria-Bertani Broth. The glass rods \n 8 \nwere replaced by 4 mm glass beads spread on the plate. Plates were incubated at room \ntemperature (25 \u00baC) in the dark and enumeration was carried out visually after 3 days [19]. \n \n1.6. Microscopic analysis of the bacterial community \nColonization of the different solid substrates was assessed using an Environmental \nScanning Electronic Microscope (ESEM Philips, FEI XL 30). Samples were fixed in 3% \n(v\/v) glutaraldehyde, washed twice in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.1) for 10 min and \ndehydrated in an alcohol series (10 min each in 30, 50, 70, 80, 90%, and 3\u00d710 min in \n100%) in a fume cupboard. The specimens were then transferred into critical point drier \nbaskets under 100% alcohol and dried in a pre-cooled Hitachi HCP-2 critical point drier. \nAfter gold palladium sputter coating (Polaron Equipment Limited SEM, coating unit \nE5100), the samples were examined in the ESEM at 10 keV. \n \n1.7. Genetic analysis of the bacterial community \nDNA extraction from the PB (at 2.5 h, 96 h and 263 h) and the CGR (at 3 h, 74 h and 162 \nh) liquid samples was carried out using the Zymo Research Fungal\/Bacterial DNA \nextraction kit as described by Lejon et al. [20]. Purified DNA was suspended in 50 \u00b5L of \nsterile water and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. All extracted genomic DNA \nsamples were stored at \u201320 \u00b0C until further processing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified \nby PCR using universal bacterial 16S primers 27-F and 1492-R [21]. PCR amplification \nwas performed using Lucigen EconoTaq plus Green master mix. PCR products \n(approximately 1400 bp) were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and cleaned with PCR \npurification kit (Qiagen). PCR products were then cloned using the CloneJet kit \n 9 \n(Fermentas) according to the manufacture\u2019s specifications. The screening of inserts from \nthe transformants was performed by direct PCR amplification from colonies using primers \nfor the pJET1.2F and pJET1.2R sites on the plasmid. Amplified inserts were identified on \ngel electrophoresis and cleaned by using the ZR-DNA Sequencing Clean-up kit\u2122 (Zymo \nResearch Corp). DNA sequences were determined by using an ABI 3130XL genetic \nanalyzer and the BigDye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). \nSequences were compared to the GenBank nucleotide database library by BLAST on-line \nsearches [22].  \n \n2. Results and discussion \n2.1. Substrates characterization \nCharacterization of the solid matter showed that different origins and composition of the \ndomestic garden refuse in relation to the commercial sample are evident (Table 2). \nPrimarily large palm leaves, grass and twigs constituted the former, while the latter \ncontained largely woody waste, tree bark and branches that made it more similar to the pine \nbark. These differences in composition, associated with the substrates\u2019 origins and \ncollection methods, reflect also the amount and nature of the available carbon for \ndenitrification which was two times higher in CGR than in DGR (Table 2). The high C\/N \nratio for the pine bark fell within the expected range as in literature, while the low value for \nthe compost suggested an IV and V degree of maturity for the CGR and DGR, respectively \n(DIN 4187), with levels slightly higher than the optimum range of 13-16 for stabilised \ngarden refuse compost [11]. Overall, CGR and PB displayed similar characteristics with \nrespect to their composition, origin and C\/N before composting suggesting a similarity in \n 10 \nthe way carbon is released during denitrification. It is also worthy to note that high amounts \nof nitrogen, COD and TS are released from the DGR after 24 hours contact time with water \n(eluate tests) as well as during the batch tests (Table 3) through mechanisms of bio-leaching \nas observed also by other authors [6, 13, 33]. During this initial period ammonia is \npromptly converted into nitrites by nitrifiers as oxygen is still trapped in the water, while \ndenitrification is limited by the availability of electron donors with a consequent increase in \nnitrate concentrations [6]. \n2.2. Batch tests \nAlthough no significant differences were observed for the DGR, CGR and PB Batch tests \nin term of nitrate removal, each substrate showed a distinct biotransformation rate. In the \ntest with the CGR, complete removal of nitrates in solution was achieved within 8 days \n(Fig. 1). The DGR tests showed a large initial release of nitrate (500 mg l\n-1\n) in solution by \nthe substrate, independently of the input nitrate concentration (Fig. 1). However, the nitrate \nconsumption rate remained close to that of the CGR tests and the complete denitrification \nwas achieved within 8 days. The onset of denitrification was generally slower in the tests \nwith PB and complete nitrate removal was not achieved, as the final concentration \nplateaued around 150 mg l\n-1\n after 11 days (data not shown). This finding suggests the \noccurrence of a strong inhibitory effect on the active denitrifier population. Further this \ncould be explained by the low pH observed during the batch tests with PB (Table 4), as \nsuggested by other studies [6, 13, 33].  Although a neutral pH in the batch tests with \ncompost could suggest a more favourable condition for microbial activity, the high release \nof COD and nitrate in the DGR is of concern and would require further investigation (Table \n4). \n 11 \n \n2.3. Initial inoculation effect  \nNo direct effects were observed on nitrate removal in the inoculated batch test (data not \nshown). In a denitrification study using newspapers as a carbon source, Volokita et al. [12] \nfound that an initial inoculation with a solid matrix was far more efficient than with a liquid \ninoculum. On the contrary, Ovez et al. [9] reported an inhibitory effect when inoculating \ntheir batches with bacteria from previous experiments.  These contrasting effects might be \nexplained by the extreme complexity of the microbial community established during the \ndenitrification process, which is strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate and the \nexperimental conditions. In general, inoculation using a solid substrate containing a well-\nestablished microflora should be preferred to an inoculum derived from the liquid phase. \n \n2.4. Effect of the solid substrates on the size of the aerobic bacterial community \nThe number of colony forming units (CFU) for both the CGR and DGR (Fig. 2) was \nestimated to be 5.10\n7\n CFU ml\n-1\n at the beginning of the experiment and decreased by five \norders of magnitude during the first two days. The viable bacterial community present in \nthe PB test at the beginning of the experiment was accounted to 3.10\n8\n CFU ml\n-1\n, which is \nten times higher than in the compost tests (Fig. 2). A logarithmic decrease (R\n2\n=0.94) was \nobserved during the first 7 days, leading to a constant bacteria concentration of 1.10\n7\n CFU \nml\n-1\n until the test was stopped. Assuming CFU were mainly using carbon and nitrate for \ntheir development, it should be possible to establish a relationship between CFU numbers \nand denitrification rate. The correlation between these two parameters for the liquid phase \nof the PB batch tests was good (r\n2\n > 0.80) and confirmed that carbon and nitrate depletions \n 12 \nwere mainly related to the microbial activity. Whilst this finding is in agreement with \nprevious studies [6, 7, 8], it should be interpreted with much care. Indeed, the enumeration \nof the bacteria in the liquid phase does not account for those proliferating on the surface of \nthe substrates (biofilms), and as such, it may not constitute a reliable indicator [7]. \n \n2.5. Effect of the solid substrates on the bacterial community \nPhylogenetic analysis was performed on 16S ribosomal DNA for each treatment in order to \nobtain further insight into the bacterial community structure and dynamics (Table 2). Even \nif the same tendencies were observed for the three treatments (dominance of Gamma-\nproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in all libraries) differences were observed \nbetween composts and PB applications. During the acclimatization period, the bacterial \ncommunity observed in the CGR and DGR tests was essentially composed of \nGammaproteobacteria commonly found in natural environments, e.g. Pseudomonas putida, \nPseudoxanthomonas, Rheinheimera sp. [23]. In contrast, the PB test was dominated by \nEnterobacteria including Rahnella, Panteoa, Kluyvera and Enterobacter which are typical \nof pine bark [24]. The population of Rahnella sp. largely dominated during the experiment \nwhile Pantoea agglomerans disappeared halfway through the experiment as being \noutcompeted by Lactobacillus and Erwinia sp. which both are known to be unable to \nreduce nitrate [25]. Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea agglomerans are potential human \npathogens [24] and as such could prevent the applicability of the pine bark in full-scale \noperations. .  \nBacteria capable of reducing nitrate into ammonia such as Acinetobacter sp. for \nGammaproteobacteria [26] and Clostridium sp. for Firmicutes [27]  as well as bacteria \n 13 \ncapable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction such as Rhizobium sp. and Thermomonas sp. \n[28]) were identified after 74 hours treatment in the CGR eluates. In contrast, dominance of \nThermoactinomyces in the DGR eluate after 74 hours suggests that these bacteria can first \nproduce nitrous acid from nitrate followed by the generation of ammonium as they have \nboth nitrate-reducing and ammonium-forming ability [29]. Over time, the bacterial \ncommunity in the CGR eluate evolved towards a consortium of denitrifiers mainly \ncomposed of Rheinheimera sp., Phaeospirillum sp. and Flavobacterium sp. [23, 30, 31]. \nPhaespirillum sp. has been described as being able to use ammonia as a nitrogen source \n[31]. This suggests that it could counterbalance the presence of the ammonia-producing \nbacteria present in the second step of the experiment. This hypothesis is further supported \nby the low concentration of ammonia found at the end of the experiment (NH3-N = 3 mg L\n-\n1\n) \n \n2.6. Bacterial colonization of the solid substrates \nThe interpretation of ESEM micrographs could be challenging as the preparation of the \nsamples may significantly change the matrix structure through shrinking and deformation \n[32]. To overcome this limitation, solid substrates before and after treatment were \ncompared. Before treatment, cocci and fungal spores were the two most abundant \norganisms colonizing the surfaces of CGR while numerous cocci and rod-shaped bacteria \nwere observed on the surfaces of DGR (Fig. 3 and 4). After treatment, rod-shaped bacteria \ndominantly colonized CGR surfaces (Fig. 5) whilst no changes were observed in DGR tests \n(data not shown). This finding suggests that the composted domestic garden refuse (DGR) \noffers a favourable surface for the rapid development of a biofilm of denitrifiers and that \n 14 \nNO3\n-\n exerts a selective pressure on promoting the growth of rod-shaped bacteria leading to \nthe formation of a superficial biofilm.  \nNumerous cocci were visible on the surface of the PB before incubation (Fig. 6). After \ntreatment, very few bacterial cells were observed in the control and nitrate-rich tests (data \nnot shown) due to possible inhibitory effects or desorption of most of the bacteria from the \nsurface of the pine bark into the liquid phase. Previous studies demonstrated that pine barks \ncould release large amounts of phenolic compounds and hydroxylated benzene rings, which \nboth can inhibit the activity of various bacterial enzymes [32, 33]. Added to this, a \nconstantly low pH during the process did not contribute in creating favourable conditions to \nbacterial growth. \n \n3. Conclusion \nThe composts (CGR and DGR) proved to be efficient substrates for denitrification, \npromoting the sustained development of a complex biofilm as a niche for the denitrifying \ncommunities. The phylogenetic analysis carried out on CGR and DGR samples showed that \nthe bacterial community evolved from a diverse community towards a limited consortium \nof active denitrifiers. Pine bark was found to be far less efficient in promoting favourable \nconditions for microbial growth because of the combined effect of a low pH and the release \nof potentially inhibitory compounds leading to the irreversible release of biofilm forming \ncells into the leachate. Furthermore, potential pathogens have been detected in association \nwith the pine bark, rendering unsuitable its use as a carbon source for the treatment of \nnitrate-rich leachates at a large scale. Overall, this study contributes in pointing out the \ndifferent behaviour displayed by the microorganisms from different substrates in the solid \n 15 \nand liquid phases and highlights the important role of biofilms in the denitrification process \nand their sensitivity to prevailing environmental conditions. \n \nAcknowledgements: This study was conducted under the aegis of the NRF (SA) and \nCNRS (France) Scientific Collaboration Agreement.
