Diode structures produced on aluminium-metallised poly(imide) \nsubstrates, and with gold top contacts, have been examined with respect to their electrical properties. The results suggest \nthat a Schottky conduction mechanism occurs in the reverse biased diode, with a barrier to charge injection at the \naluminium electrode. Optical absorption\/emission spectra reveal a band gap of 2.48 eV for the polymer. The diodes have \nbeen used for direct charge detection of 17 keV X-rays, generated by a molybdenum source. Using operating voltages of \n-10 and -50 V respectively, sensitivities of 54 and 158 nC\/mGy\/cm3 have been achieved. Increasing the operating \nvoltage shows that the diodes are stable up to approximately -200 V without significant increase in the dark current of \nthe device (<0.2 nA). \n \nKeywords: Dosimeter, X-ray, Semiconducting polymer, diode, flexible \n1. INTRODUCTION \nOrganic materials are currently poised to open a new range of applications, including carbon-based electronics, organic \nsensors, and flexible display technology. [1] In particular, there has been a rapid growth in the technology sector that \ncovers flexible, printed, and organic electronics (FPOE). [2] This has been achieved through the discovery of novel \norganic-based electronic materials, and via optimization of the properties of existing devices, through improvements in \ndevice architecture and fabrication. [3] Such organic materials, which include conjugated, semiconducting polymers, \npotentially offer device solutions that challenge those of conventional silicon-based semiconductor technologies. For \nexample, in the past decade, exploitation of the properties of polymers has led to the development of organic sensors for \nradiation detection and dosimetry [4, 5] and imaging [6]. These detectors complement solid-state dosimeters based on \ntraditional inorganic materials, [7] and emerging technologies, [8] but also present their own unique advantages over \ntheir inorganic counterparts. [9] \n \nSpecifically, the physical characteristics of polymer systems lend themselves to the production of large-area, flexible \ndosimeters. Large area dosimetry panels can be used in proximity to power reactors for detection of emitted radiation, \noffering improved solid angle coverage and sensitivity, compared to small discrete devices. Being flexible, such a large \narea detector panel could be formed as a tube and placed around piping to remotely monitor radioactive fluids\/steam etc. \nSegmented (multi-channel) detectors could be formed from a large area panel, giving spatial dose information such as \nbeam profiling. In contrast, current large area dosimeters using either gas detector or scintillation technology, tend to be \nbulky and difficult to install in compact locations. In this work we have developed polymer radiation detectors operating \nas direct detection charge-based devices, in contrast to a scintillation or electro-chemical detection method [10].. Here \nwe report results from prototype small area (~1 cm2), flexible dosimeters, incorporating a thick (>1 \u03bcm) semiconducting \npolymer active layer, and test the dosimetry characteristics using soft X-rays. \n                                                          \n\u2020 These authors have contributed equally to this work \n\u2217Corresponding authors: J.Keddie@surrey.ac.uk, P.Sellin@surrey.ac.uk, www.ph.surrey.ac.uk \nHard X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Neutron Detector Physics XI, edited by Ralph B.

METHODOLOGY \n2.1. Materials \nThe polymer used in this study was poly([9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl]-co-bithiophene) (F8T2, Inset Figure 2), which \nwas used as received. Polyimide (Kapton\u00ae, 0.025 mm thick), coated on one side with aluminium (50-100 nm thick) with \na nominal sheet resistance of 2.5 \u03a9\u25a1-1, was purchased from Goodfellow Ltd., UK. Toluene (99.99%) (Sigma-Aldrich \nChemical Co., UK) was used as received. \n2.2. Dosimeter production \nF8T2 (5 wt.% solution in toluene) was spin-cast on top of the aluminium (Al) layer of the aluminium-coated polyimide \n(ca. 1.5 x 1.5 cm2).. The spin processing conditions for the polymer films were: 1) accelerated at 100 rpm\/s to 200 rpm \nand held for 100 s, 2) accelerated at 100 rpm\/s to 500 rpm and held for 60 s, 3) accelerated at 100 rpm\/s to 2000 rpm and \nheld for 30 s, 4) decelerated at 100 rpm\/s. This procedure produced a relatively smooth polymer film with a thickness of \n~10 \u03bcm. After this, the films were typically dry to the touch; a short period of drying under atmospheric conditions was \nhowever required for some films, before annealing under vacuum at 110\u00b0C for 24 h. The thickness of the polymer layers \nwas subsequently measured using a surface profilometer (Dektak, Veeco Instruments). To complete the diode, gold (Au) \nelectrodes (50 nm thick, 0.5 x 0.5 cm2) were thermally evaporated onto the F8T2, through a shadow mask, at a pressure \nof 10-6 mbar. The diodes were connected to the measurement electronics through filament wires attached by gold paste to \nthe electrodes. Finally, the diodes were coated with paraffin wax (0CON-194 Logitech Ltd, UK) by dip coating the diode \nin the molten wax. Upon completion, the dosimeters were stored under nitrogen and in the dark to minimize any adverse \noxidation effects. \n2.3. Diode characterization \nThe current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the (PI)Al\/F8T2\/Au diodes were examined using a voltage source-\npicoammeter (487, Keithley Instruments) by applying a bias voltage from 0 V to \u00b1250 V to the gold contact, with a \nvoltage step of 5 V. UV-visible spectroscopy (M350 double beam, Camspec, excitation by Deuterium [180-370 nm] and \nTungsten-Halogen [370-1100 nm] lamps) and Photoluminescence (excitation by He-Ne laser [405 nm]) spectroscopy \nwere completed on thin films (~200 nm thick) of F8T2 deposited on soda lime float glass (Menzel Glaser microscope \nslides). In the case of the UV-visible spectroscopy an uncoated piece of the float glass was placed in the reference beam \nof the spectrometer. Dosimetry experiments were carried out using 17 keV K\u03b1 X-rays from a molybdenum target X-ray \ntube (XTF5011, Oxford Instruments) operated at a 50 kV anode voltage and a variable anode current (up to 0.5 mA). \nCurrent-voltage measurements were recorded for the diodes under the irradiation of the X-rays using the voltage source-\npicoammeter. For comparison, measurements were completed using a Silicon PIN photodiode (S1223-01, Hamamatsu \nCorp.) with an active area of 0.13 cm2, and thickness of 300 \u03bcm. Dose rates were measured using a dose meter (Farmer \n2670, Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an ionization chamber (2611A, Thermo Fisher Scientific). \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe dosimeter construction is shown in Figure 1 before the addition of the encapsulation layer. The flexibility of the \ndevice is demonstrated. F8T2 has been shown to be stable with respect to X-ray irradiation, but suffers from bias stress \nwhen operated in air [11] therefore, the encapsulation layer is important. The paraffin wax encapsulation material has a \nlow melting point (57-60\u00b0C) which means the shaped diode can be dipped in the molten wax without affecting the F8T2 \nactive layer, which has a glass transition temperature (Tg) ~ 100\u00b0C. The use of the wax also means solvents are not \npresent which may affect the active semiconducting polymer layer. The wax forms a barrier to atmospheric gasses, \nreducing any oxidation of the F8T2 under operation, and has a low electrical conductivity (1013-1017 \u03a9m-1) on a par with \nmany polymers, meaning that it does not interfere with the electrical processes occurring in the diode. The wax is also \nnon-toxic and has a low environmental impact. Indeed, most of the materials in the diode may be recycled, which is \nimportant if large area diodes are to be produced in the future. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7449  74491I-2\nBC\nA\nE\nD\n \nFig. 1. Photograph of a flexible F8T2 dosimeter. The semiconducting polymer, F8T2, (A) is spun down onto the flexible, \naluminium-coated polyimide substrate (B), and the diode is completed with an evaporated gold top electrode (C). The \ndosimeter is attached to a glass support (D) and the electrodes contacted to the measurement electronics through \nfilament wires (E). While held in shape, the device can be dipped in molten paraffin wax which forms an encapsulation \nlayer. \n \nI\/V measurements were recorded, from 0 to \u00b1250 V, increasing in 5 V steps, with the bias voltage applied to the gold \nelectrode (Figure 2). The plot gives a reverse bias dark current of 0.2 nA at -250 V, with a current rectification factor of \n~77 between \u00b1250 V. The diode gives conductivities of 2.7x10-12 and 2.1x10-13 Sm-1 in forward and reverse bias, \nrespectively. Examination of the reverse bias d.c. characteristics has been undertaken, using Schottky [12] and Poole-\nFrenkel [13] conduction mechanisms, for electric fields (E) > 107 Vm-1. Values for the relative permittivity, \u03b5r, and \nbarrier height, \u03c6b, calculated using these methods are given in Table 1. The permittivity value for the Schottky \nmechanism, which falls in the range expected for polymers [14], suggests that this method more closely matches the data \nin the plot, and that the conduction in these diodes is electrode limited rather than bulk limited. \n \nV \/ V\n-200 -100 0 100 200\nI \/\n A\n10-13\n10-12\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\nS\nS *\n*\nC8 H17\nH17 C8\nn\n \n5.3\n4.1\n5.0\n2.5\nAl F8T2 Au\n \nFig. 2.

Inset: a magnified plot of the tops of \nthe curves. All spectra show normalized absorption\/emission intensity data. \n \nThe optical absorption and emission spectra give an insight into the structure of the polymer film. Annealing the polymer \nincreases the crystallization in this polymer. In F8T2, this increases the conjugation length in the polymer chain, and \nincreases the luminescence output of the polymer film. The increase in the conjugation is evidenced by a bathochromic \nshift in the uv-visible absorption (to higher wavelengths) [15], and an increase in the photoluminescence from the \npolymer. Repeat uv-visible spectra (not shown), taken on the same (non-encapsulated) films one month later, display a \nsmall hypsochromic shift (<5 nm) indicating some increase in disorder in the polymer film over time. \n \nAs well as the shift in the spectra, both spectra display the formation of a double peak after annealing. Doping is known \nto affect the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of polymers in a way similar to that seen here. [16, 17] In these \nreports, the spectra in each case change from having one peak in a doped state to having two peaks when the polymer is \nin an undoped state. In our work, two peaks occur in both the absorption and photoluminescence spectra upon annealing \nthe F8T2 (Inset Figure 3) suggesting that a reduction in doping of the polymer film occurs, possibly through the \nelimination of solvent molecules left over from the solution processing. \n \nThe UV-visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy have been used to estimate the F8T2 band-gap \nenergy, Eg \u2248 2.48 eV, which is similar to that reported in the literature. [18] Using the Fermi level energies of the metals \nand the F8T2 conduction band energy level reported by Bernardo et. al [18] an energy level diagram can be constructed \nfor the diode (Inset Figure 2). If we assume that the F8T2 is a p-type polymer, as with most semiconducting polymers, \n[19] and that the gold electrode forms an ohmic contact to the F8T2 (due to the similarities in the energies of the Fermi \nlevels of the metal and that of the semiconductor; the latter of which lies just above the highest occupied molecular \norbital (HOMO) level of the p-type F8T2) a depletion layer forms in the polymer at the low Fermi energy, aluminium \ncontact. Upon formation of the depletion layer, band bending occurs which acts as a barrier to hole injection into the \naluminium. This can be used to explain the I\/V characteristics (Figure 2). Application of an increasingly negative bias to \nthe gold electrode (diode in reverse bias) increases the size of the depletion layer, the hole current is minimized and \nconsequently the current remains low. Application of an increasingly positive bias to the gold (diode in forward bias) \ndecreases the size of the depletion layer and the hole current increases. As the dark current is low in reverse bias (<1 nA), \nthe reverse biased diode was used for dosimetry experiments. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7449  74491I-4\nFigure 4 gives an indication of the performance of the F8T2 dosimeter when it is positioned in a beam of 17 keV X-rays \nfrom a molybdenum source. The current output of the dosimeter increases as the intensity of the incident X-rays \nincreases from a dose rate of 12 to 61 mGys-1 (Figure 4A). Three cycles of the measurements are shown. After a period \nof ~180 s to confirm the linearity of the background current, a dose period of 25 s is alternated with a period of 25 s with \nno dose applied. Figure 4B shows the effect of the applied bias on the signal output at increasing dose rate (DR) for three \nrepeat measurements. The effective noise level due to the background dark current is ~1x10-11 A. Increasing the voltage \napplied to the gold electrode from -10 to -50 V produces an approximately 3-fold increase in the X-ray induced \nphotocurrent, increasing the sensitivity (s) of the device from 54.2 to 158.2 nC\/mGy\/cm3 respectively, where: \n \nV\ndDR\ndI\ns\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n=  (1) \nV is the volume of the polymer film between the electrodes (= 2.25x10-4 cm3), and dI\/dDR is the slope of the curve with \nthe dose rate DR measured in mGys-1. The increase in applied voltage on the reverse biased diode increases the electric \nfield in the diode and consequently causes charge carriers produced by the incident X-rays to be more easily swept out of \nthe diode. This results in the increased photocurrent produced as the operating voltage is increased. \n \nt \/ s\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nI \/\n A\n-3.0e-9\n-2.5e-9\n-2.0e-9\n-1.5e-9\n-1.0e-9\n-5.0e-10\n0.0\n-1.0e-9\n-5.0e-10\n0.0\nA\n-10V\n-50V\nDR \/ mGy.s-1\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\nI \/\n A\n0.0\n5.0e-10\n1.0e-9\n1.5e-9\n2.0e-9\n2.5e-9\n3.0e-9\nB\n \nFig. 4.

(B) Current versus dose rate plots for the dosimeter with -10 V (solid line) and -50 V \n(dashed line) operating voltage applied: the data are the average of 3 measurements taken from Figure 4A. \n \nFigure 5 shows the increase in signal output when the operating voltage applied to the diode is increased (to -300 V). The \noperating voltage is applied for 25 s prior to irradiation, and for 25 s after irradiation, before switching to the next \noperating voltage. The dark current is measured as the average current from the two 25 s periods of applied voltage \neither side of the X-ray exposure. Irradiation of the diode at each operating voltage occurs for 25 s at an X-ray dose rate \nof 61 mGys-1. The output current increases from 1.2 to 13.6 nA when increasing the voltage from -10 to -300 V \nrespectively (Figure 5A). Plotting the output current and the dark current, measured for each operating voltage, shows \nthat although the output current increases, there is an accompanying increase in dark current (Figure 5B). This appears to \naffect the output signal at high voltages (above -200 V) when the dark current increases from <1 % to ~6 % of the signal \noutput. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7449  74491I-5\nt \/ s\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nI \/\n A\n-1.6e-8\n-1.4e-8\n-1.2e-8\n-1.0e-8\n-8.0e-9\n-6.0e-9\n-4.0e-9\n-2.0e-9\n0.0\nA\nVapplied \/ V\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nI \/\n A\n0.0\n5.0e-9\n1.0e-8\n1.5e-8\n0 100 200 300\n10-12\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8 B\n \nFig. 5.

CONCLUSIONS \nWe have demonstrated the sensitivity and linear dosimetric response of F8T2 semiconducting polymer diodes as X-ray \ndetectors. Scaling up the dimensions of these flexible radiation dosimeters will open potential application fields in such \nareas as medical dosimetry, security and the nuclear power industry. The linear dosimeter response (Figure 4), which is \nbased on electrical detection of the charge carriers produced in the semiconductor, will also allow for real time \nmonitoring of the applied dose. Flexible, segmented organic dosimeters can be used for patient dosimetry, for example \nduring cancer therapy or X-ray diagnostics, by forming large area detector panels as tubes around areas of the patient\u2019s \nbody, such as a limb, providing spatial dose information. Alternatively, portal imaging of passengers, baggage or \nvehicles, in security applications, would benefit from large area flat-panel X-ray detectors, increasing throughput when \ncompared to using small area, hand-held dosimeters. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors acknowledge financial support through the STFC (grant number: ST\/F006667\/1).
