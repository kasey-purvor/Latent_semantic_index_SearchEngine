These measurements allow the occurrence \nand rate of dayside and nightside reconnection to be deduced.  The former can be correlated \nwith upstream interplanetary magnetic field observations to give an estimate of the effective \nlength of the dayside reconnection X-line.  The latter allows a preliminary statistical study of \nflux closure during substorms and other, smaller nightside reconnection events. \n \n1. Introduction \nThe form, dynamics and energy-throughput of the magnetosphere are determined by \nthe rates of magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail.  \nTogether these control the proportion of terrestrial field lines that are interconnected \nwith the solar wind, allowing ingress and egress of plasma across the magnetopause, \nand coupling solar wind momentum into the magnetosphere to drive magnetospheric \nand ionospheric convection.  The fraction of the 8 GWb of flux associated with each \nhemisphere of the Earth that is at any instant interconnected to the interplanetary \nmagnetic field varies between 2% and perhaps 15% on timescales as short as tens of \nminutes (Milan et al., 2004).  This proportion increases when the interplanetary \nmagnetic field (IMF) is directed southwards and sub-solar reconnection at the \nmagnetopause transforms closed field lines to an open topology (Dungey, 1961, 1963).  \nThe accumulation of flux causes the ionospheric polar cap to expand and the auroral \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 2 \noval to move to lower latitudes, and is consequently sometimes referred to as the \n\u201csubstorm growth phase\u201d.  Reconnection in the magnetotail, often associated with \nsubstorm break-up, closes open flux and causes the polar cap to contract; the appearance \nand development of the break-up aurora associated with the substorm has resulted in the \nname \u201csubstorm expansion phase\u201d.  It now appears that there are also intervals of tail \nreconnection that are not associated with the classic signatures of substorms (e.g. break-\nup aurora, magnetogram bays), which often occur during periods of northward IMF \n(Grocott et al., 2003, 2004; Milan et al., 2005b).  When the IMF is directed northwards \ndayside reconnection no longer occurs between closed terrestrial field lines and the \nIMF, but with lobe field lines \u2013 field lines that are already open (e.g. Russell, 1972; \nCowley, 1981; Reiff and Burch, 1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992).  In this situation \nthe amount of open flux in the magnetosphere does not change but that which is present \nis \u201cstirred\u201d. \nThe level of reconnection at the magnetopause or in the magnetotail cannot be \ndetermined from point observations in space, as reconnection X-lines are expected to be \nmany Earth radii in extent.  However, the ionospheric footprints of these X-lines, or \nmerging gaps, can be mapped by ground-based radars or space-based auroral imagers, \nallowing their dynamics and extent to be determined.  Ionospheric plasma flow across a \nmerging gap allows the reconnection electric field to be measured, which if known \nalong the whole length of the merging gap, gives the overall reconnection voltage (e.g. \nBaker et al., 1997; Pinnock and Rodger, 2001; Grocott et al., 2002; Milan et al., 2003, \nChisham et al., 2004).  Alternatively, if the boundary between open and closed field \nlines (the open\/closed field line boundary or OCB) can be determined in the ionosphere, \nthen the open flux content of the magnetosphere can be quantified, from which it is \npossible to deduce the reconnection rates (e.g. Taylor et al., 1996; Mishin et al., 1997; \nMilan et al., 2003, 2004, 2005b; Milan, 2004b).  It is the purpose of the present paper to \nreview how such measurements are made and describe our current understanding of the \ndynamics of the system. \n \n2. Measuring the open flux content of the magnetosphere \nThe open flux of the magnetotail lobes maps to the northern and southern \nionospheric polar caps.  The amount of open flux FPC is found by integrating the radial \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 3 \ncomponent of the magnetic field B (assumed dipolar) over either of the polar caps (FPC \nis necessarily equal in each):  \n . (1) \u222b \u22c5=\nPC\nPC dF sB\nThis requires that the extent of the polar cap is known, or in other words that the latitude \nof the open\/closed field line boundary (OCB) can be found at all local times.  This is \nmost readily identified by the particle populations residing on either side of the \nboundary, and the impact that these have on the ionosphere.  On closed field lines, \nequatorward of the boundary, high energy (several\u2014100s keV) are trapped as they \nmirror between the conjugate hemispheres.  Once field lines are opened, however, \nparticles are no longer trapped and are rapidly lost to the magnetotail.  Solar wind \nplasma can gain entry to the magnetosphere on recently opened field lines, though these \nmirror only once before populating the mantle.  Hence at low altitudes, high energy \nparticles (esp. accelerated by the reconnection process) can be observed on open field \nlines downstream of the dayside merging gap, though these can be recognized and \ndistinguished from trapped particles by their characteristic dispersed \u2013 and sometimes \nstepped \u2013 nature (e.g. Lockwood and Smith, 1992). \nThe OCB can be found, then, by determining the poleward edge of the trapped \nparticle region.  Several techniques can be used, but the most obvious is by direct \nmeasurement of the precipitating particle populations by polar-orbiting satellites (e.g. \nSotirelis et al., 1998).  This technique has the disadvantage that such spacecraft can \nidentify the boundary only along their orbit, that is at two points in each pass of the \npolar regions.  Alternatively, global auroral imaging from space allows the aurora \ngenerated by the trapped particles to be identified over the whole of the polar region \n(e.g. Frank and Craven, 1988).  Care must be taken with this technique as different \ncameras will have different detection thresholds and are sensitive to precipitation of \nparticles in different energy regimes.  Also, in summer, the dayside oval can be \nobscured by dayglow.  Furthermore, the orbits of present imagers are such that \ncontinuous observation of the polar regions are only possible for periods of 8\u201412 \nhours.  Other techniques for identifying the OCB include detection of the ionospheric \nelectron density enhancement produced by precipitating trapped particles, for instance \nwith an incoherent scatter radar (e.g. de la Beaujardiere et al., 1991; Blanchard et al., \n2001), and identification of the spectral width boundary observed by coherent radars \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 4 \n(e.g. Chisham and Freeman, 2003).  Ideally, a combination of some or all of these \nmeasurement techniques can be used to improve accuracy (Milan et al., 2003).  \nRecently, intercalibration of the different techniques has been undertaken (e.g. Wild et \nal., 2004; Chisham et al., 2005).  It is difficult to assess the uncertainty in the \nmeasurement of FPC, but assuming that the latitude of the OCB is over- or \nunderestimated by 1\u00b0 at all local times leads to an error margin of \u00b110% (Milan et al., \n2003). \nUsing these techniques several intervals have been analysed to determine the \nvariation of FPC with time.  Three such intervals, 5 June 1998 (Milan et al., 2003), 26 \nAugust 1998 (Milan et al., 2004), and 19 January 2002 (Milan et al., 2005b), are shown \nin Figure 1.  FPC is shown by the grey curves in panels a, f, and k, and can be seen to \nvary between approximately 0.2 and 1.0 GWb, that is between 2.5 and 12% of the flux \nassociated with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.  The next section describes how \nreconnection rates can be deduced from these observations.  \n \n3. Determining dayside and nightside reconnection rates \nChanges in the open flux content of the magnetosphere are related to the rates of \nsub-solar magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection through Faraday\u2019s Law: \n ND\nPC\ndt\ndF \u03a6\u2212\u03a6=  (2) \nwhere \u03a6D and \u03a6N are the rates (voltages) of creation and destruction of open flux at the \nlow latitude dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail, respectively (e.g. Siscoe and \nHuang, 1985).  Another means of determining the dayside reconnection rate is to \nintegrate the Y component of the motional electric field of the solar wind along an \neffective X-line length LD, that is \n SSWDD BVL=\u03a6 . (3) \nHere VSW is the solar wind speed (effectively the plasma and magnetic flux inflow \nspeed) and BS is the southward component of the IMF defined as \n  (4) \n\uf8f3\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n>\n<\u2212=\n0,0\n0,\nz\nzz\nS B\nBB\nB\n(we can similarly define the northward component BN), which sets the sub-solar \nreconnection rate to zero when the IMF is directed northwards.  Combining Eqs. 2 and 3 \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 5 \nallows determination of the effective length of the reconnection X-line from the growth \nrate of the polar cap area (during periods when it can be assumed that \u03a6N = 0), and as \ndemonstrated by Milan (2004a, b) and Milan et al. (2004, 2005b) this gives values of LD \nin the range 5\u20148 RE.  This represents approximately 20% of the cross-wind scale size \nof the magnetosphere, and tallies nicely with the 20% reconnection efficiency \ndetermined by previous workers (e.g. Reiff et al., 1981; Holzer et al., 1986).  We \nsuperimpose the growth of the polar cap estimated from Eqs. 2 and 3 for values of LD = \n5, 8, and 6 RE, respectively, as dotted curves in panels a, f, and, k of Fig. 1; also shown \nare the corresponding times series of IMF Bz (panels c, h, and m) and \u03a6D (panels d, i, \nand n).  In each case, the observed rate of growth of FPC is reproduced well by the \nprediction; although the value of LD varies from interval to interval, within each interval \nLD remains consistent.  Understanding the variation of LD between events requires \nfurther study.   \nDecreases in FPC are caused by episodes of nightside reconnection, \u03a6N > 0.  The \noccurrence, rate, and duration of these episodes can be found by fitting the model \nprediction to the data.  We find that if it is assumed that the reconnection rate occurs at a \nuniform rate for a set length of time in each case, then a good fit can be achieved.  Ten \nsuch episodes are identified during the three intervals shown in Fig. 1, with the variation \nof \u03a6N being indicated in panels d, i, and n by grey rectangles, with the fitted model \nvariation in FPC being shown by the solid curves in panels a, f, and k.  Bursts of \nreconnection last between 30 and 200 mins, at rates spanning 20 to 200 kV; in Section 4 \nwe will look in more depth at these reconnection characteristics. \nThe onset of each nightside reconnection burst, indicated by vertical dashed lines, is \nnot determined solely from the variation in FPC, however.  In most cases, significant \nsubstorm indicators are observed simultaneously, including Pi2 pulsations and the onset \nof associated magnetogram substorm bays.  Also, break-up aurora are associated with \nsubstorms (marked SB) and lesser auroral brightenings (marked AB), which can be \nmonitored by finding the maximum auroral luminosity observed on the nightside, Imax, \nshown in panels b, g, and l (equally, a spatially integrated auroral power could also be \nemployed).  The largest nightside reconnection bursts are associated with large \nenhancements in the auroral luminosity, smaller enhancements in brightness are \nassociated with weaker reconnection bursts; indeed, a good correlation is found between \nImax and \u03a6N.  In the main, the luminosity increases promptly at the onset of reconnection \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 6 \n(the discrepancy between onset and brightening at 10\u201411 UT, 26 August 1998, is due \nto only partial coverage of the nightside oval by the imager at this time), followed by a \nquasi-exponential decay to the background luminosity, though with occasional re-\nbrightenings.  The duration of the brightening and the reconnection burst are well \ncorrelated.  The observations suggest that while the brightness decays gradually, the \nreconnection continues uniformly.  We suggest that the initial increase in luminosity is \nassociated with the formation of a near-Earth neutral line, and that the decay in \nluminosity represents the tailward motion of the X-line towards the distant neutral line. \nThe dayside and nightside reconnection rates are also related to the rate of transport \nof flux and plasma across the polar cap, quantified by the cross polar cap potential \u03a6PC.  \nThere are two methods of measuring \u03a6PC: (a) determine the voltage drop along a dawn-\ndusk cut of the polar cap, for instance with a polar orbiting spacecraft; (b) fully \ndetermine the electrostatic potential pattern associated with the convection (e.g. using \nthe SuperDARN or AMIE techniques) and define \u03a6PC as the difference between the \nmaximum and minimum of the potential.  In the former case, it can be shown that the \ncross polar cap potential will tend towards \n ( ) VNDPC \u03a6+\u03a6+\u03a6=\u03a6 21  (5) \n(Lockwood and Cowley, 1992), where \u03a6V is the voltage associated with any viscous-\nlike interaction between the solar wind and the magnetopause, whereas the second \nmethod will give values closer to \n . (6) \nND\nND\nVN\nVD\nPC \u03a6<\u03a6\n\u03a6>\u03a6\n\uf8f3\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u03a6+\u03a6\n\u03a6+\u03a6=\u03a6\n,\n,\nAs noted by Milan (2004b), care must be taken in comparing studies that have used \ndifferent techniques for measuring the cross polar cap potential as Eq. 6 will \nconsistently give greater estimates of \u03a6PC than Eq. 5.  Panels e, j, and o show \u03a6PC \ncalculated from Eq. 5, assuming \u03a6V = 0.  The transpolar voltage remains non-zero for \nthe majority of the intervals, even during periods when IMF Bz > 0 nT and dayside \ncoupling is not expected; at these times, nightside reconnection drives the convection.  \nThese observations suggest that no viscous-like interaction need be invoked to explain \nthe average residual cross polar cap potential during periods of IMF Bz > 0 nT (Milan, \n2004b). \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 7 \nThe discussion so far has concentrated on sub-solar and magnetotail reconnection, \nwhich cause the overall quantity of open flux in the magnetosphere to change.  When \nIMF Bz > 0 nT, reconnection is expected to occur at high latitudes between the IMF and \nlobe field lines.  This does not change the flux in the system, but rather stirs that which \nis already present.  In this case, the rate of reconnection cannot be determined from \nobservations of the polar cap size.  However, as demonstrated by Milan et al. (2005b), \nthe presence of transpolar arcs within the polar cap allow the movement of flux within \nthe polar cap to be quantified.  Such observations suggest that if the lobe reconnection \nrate is predicted from IMF observations in a similar manner to Eq. 3, substituting BN for \nBS, then the lobe reconnection X-line length deduced is of the order of 1 RE.  This \npredicts lobe reconnection rates that are consistent with those found by Chisham et al. \n(2004) from measurements of the associated ionospheric convection flow.  Further work \nis needed to fully quantify the lobe reconnection rate, as we might expect it to depend \non season and the IMF Bx component, both of which are known to modulate the \nreconnection geometries available at high latitudes. \n \n4. Nightside reconnection rate and duration \nIn the intervals studied so far (including the three shown in Fig. 1), we have \nidentified 14 nightside reconnection bursts.  Of these, 9 display classical substorm \nsignatures (SB) and 3 we classify as auroral brightenings (AB).  Of the substorms, one \nis triggered by an external pressure pulse in the solar wind (see Milan et al., 2004).  The \nfinal event (NS \u2013 non-substorm) is a reconnection burst which occurs during northwards \nIMF, without substorm indicators, and with a characteristic convection signature \npreviously described by Grocott et al. (2003, 2004, 2005) and Milan et al. (2005b).  In \nthis section we describe the characteristics of these events.  Figure 2 presents \nhistograms of (a) the polar cap flux prior to the onset of each event, (b) the flux \nremaining after each event, (c) the reconnection rate, (d) the event duration, and (e) the \ntotal flux closed during each burst.  The latter is not necessarily equal to the difference \nbetween the flux before and after the event, as flux can be opened on the dayside during \nthe course of the nightside burst.  One event continued beyond the end of the \nmeasurement interval, so although the initial flux and reconnection rate could be \ncalculated, the final flux, the event duration, and the flux closed are not known.  As a \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 8 \nconsequence, 14 events are shown in panels a and c; only 13 events are seen in panels b, \nd, and e.  \nIn all cases the polar cap contained at least 0.5 GWb of open flux prior to onset, the \naverage flux being nearly 0.8 GWb (Fig. 2a).  The polar cap contracted to under 0.5 \nGWb during 9 out of 13 events (Fig. 2b).  In the remaining events, on average 0.8 GWb \nof flux remained after the reconnection ceased; of these, two were auroral brightenings \nwhich did not close much flux, and of the remaining two substorms, the rate of dayside \nopening of flux was very high during one.  We conclude that substorms tend to occur \nwhen 10% of the Earth\u2019s magnetic flux is open and in general continue until half of this \nflux has been closed. \nThe rate of reconnection (Fig. 2c) takes a wide variety of values between 30 and 200 \nkV, with no clear dependence on the classification of event.  There is evidence (not \nshown) that the rate of reconnection is determined by the amount of open flux in the \npolar cap at the start of the event (excluding the externally triggered substorm): if FPC < \n0.75 GWb, N\u03a6  \u2248 50 kV, if FPC > 0.75 GWb, N\u03a6  \u2248 100 kV.  As with the rate, the \nduration of the events (Fig. 2d) varies greatly, between 20 and 200 mins.  The very \nlongest events (over 100 mins) were all substorms.  Finally, the total flux closed during \neach event (Fig. 2e) varied between just under 0.1 and 0.8 GWb.  All auroral \nbrightenings closed less than 0.3 GWb; all events that closed more than 0.4 GWb were \nsubstorms; on average, substorms closed 0.5 GWb of flux. \nIt is hoped that further investigation of reconnection rate and duration, polar cap \nflux, and external factors such as solar wind dynamic pressure at reconnection onset, \nmight lead to a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of substorm \ntriggers. \n \n5. Conclusions \nMeasurements of the flux content of the polar cap, using global auroral imagery, \nparticle precipitation characteristics, and radar observations, allows the coupling \nbetween the solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere, to be investigated.  We find \nthat the polar cap expands when the IMF is directed southwards and sub-solar \nreconnection creates new open flux.  The polar cap contracts during episodes of \nmagnetotail reconnection, usually associated with substorm onset.  The reconnection \nstarts promptly as the nightside auroral intensity increases at substorm onset; the \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 9 \nintensity thereafter decreases gradually, though the reconnection continues at a uniform \nrate, until the quiescent auroral state is re-attained.  Reconnection events can last \nbetween 20 and 200 mins, at rates between 30 and 200 kV.  The rate is perhaps related \nto the size of the polar cap at reconnection onset: the rate appears faster if the polar cap \nis larger and the tail is more stressed.  In the events observed so far, reconnection only \nstarts once the polar cap contains more than 0.5 GWb.  The polar cap has not been \nobserved to contain more than 1 GWb of flux, i.e. tail reconnection is usually initiated \nbefore this upper limit is reached. \nThe deduced dayside reconnection rates imply that reconnection is occurring across \n20% of the width of the magnetosphere at any one time.  On the other hand, \nobservations of flux transfer events at the dayside magnetopause and their signatures in \nthe ionosphere suggest that dayside reconnection occurs in quasi-episodic bursts which \nmay last for 2 min, with a canonical repetition rate of 8 min (e.g. Lockwood and Smith, \n1992).  These two pieces of information, taken together, indicate that reconnection must \noccur in an on-off fashion across a very significant fraction of the dayside \nmagnetopause.  This may explain why transient reconnection signatures can be seen in \nthe ionosphere in regions that map to the magnetospheric flanks (e.g. Milan et al., \n2000). \nThe measurements outlined in this paper not only allow the reconnection rates to be \ndetermined, but can also be employed to deduce the size and shape of the magnetotail, \nwhich is formed from those field lines which map to the polar cap (Dungey, 1961, \n1965).  Milan et al. (2004) showed that the tail inflates and deflates as the polar cap \nexpands and contracts.  In addition, knowing the size of the polar cap and the past rates \nof dayside and nightside reconnection, allow the length and flux content of the distant \nmagnetotail to be deduced (Milan, 2004a).  Such observations are a powerful tool for \nthe diagnosis of the state of the terrestrial magnetosphere.  Further work is necessary to \nquantify the change in polar cap flux for more events.  This will allow investigation of \nthe factors that control the length the dayside merging gap, and a more comprehensive \nstatistical study of tail reconnection characteristics, including substorm triggering, \nreconnection rate and duration. \nFinally, these ideas have recently been applied to other magnetospheres, esp. that of \nSaturn (Jackman et al., 2004; Cowley et al., 2005; Milan et al., 2005a; Badman et al., \n2005).  It is hoped that in this way we will gain a generalized insight into the physics of \nCOSPAR 2004 01\/08\/2005 10 \nsolar wind-magnetosphere coupling that applies to all magnetized solar system bodies, \nnot just Earth. \n \nReferences \nBadman, S.
