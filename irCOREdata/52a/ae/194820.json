Optical spectroscopy is available for 20 of these low\nX-ray-to-optical flux ratio objects. Most of them are found to be associated with Galactic stars\n(a total of eight) and broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs; a total of eight). We also find two\nsources with optical spectra showing absorption and\/or narrow emission lines and X-ray\/optical\nproperties suggesting AGN activity. Another two sources are found to be associated with\nlow-redshift galaxies with narrow emission-line optical spectra, X-ray luminosities LX(0.5\u2013\n8 keV) \u2248 1041 erg s\u22121 and log f X\/f opt \u2248 \u22122 suggesting \u2018normal\u2019 star-forming galaxies. Despite\nthe small-number statistics the sky density of \u2018normal\u2019 X-ray-selected star-forming galaxies at\nthe flux limit of the present sample is low, consistent with previous ROSAT High-Resolution\nImager (HRI) deep surveys. Also, the number density estimated here is in good agreement\nwith both the log N\u2013log S of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field North (extrapolated\nto bright fluxes) and model predictions based on the X-ray luminosity function of local star-\nforming galaxies.\nKey words: surveys \u2013 X-rays: galaxies \u2013 X-rays: general.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nX-ray surveys with the ROSAT and more recently with the Chan-\ndra and the XMM\u2013Newton observatories have demonstrated that the\nX-ray source population is a heterogeneous mix of objects compris-\ning (i) powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or quasi-stellar ob-\njects (QSOs), (ii) galaxy groups\/clusters, (iii) low-luminosity AGNs,\n(iv) \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies with X-ray emission dominated by stellar\nprocesses, and (v) a small number of Galactic stars (Lehmann et al.\n2001; Barger et al. 2002; Hornschemeier et al. 2003).\nPowerful AGNs are identified in X-ray surveys by their enhanced\nX-ray-to-optical flux ratios log f X\/f opt \u0001 \u22121. These sources are\nresponsible for the bulk of the diffuse X-ray background (XRB)\nand are therefore important for constraining models of the origin of\nthe XRB.\nIn addition to powerful AGNs, deep surveys with the Chandra\nobservatory reaching fluxes well below f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u0002 10\u221215 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 have revealed large numbers of low X-ray-to-optical flux\n\u0002E-mail: age@astro.noa.gr\nratio sources with log f X\/f opt \u0002 \u22121. These objects, although too\nfaint to contribute significantly to the XRB, are detected in in-\ncreasing numbers with decreasing flux and are likely to outnum-\nber powerful AGNs below f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u2248 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n(Hornschemeier et al. 2003). The low X-ray-to-optical flux ra-\ntio regime is thought to be populated by low-luminosity AGNs\n(LLAGNs) and \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies (Hornschemeier et al. 2003). In-\ndeed, sources with \u22122 \u0002 log f X\/f opt \u0002 \u22121 exhibit enhanced ac-\ntivity attributed to either starbursts or LLAGNs (Alexander et al.\n2002; Bauer et al. 2002; Georgakakis et al. 2003b; Hornschemeier\net al. 2003). Even lower X-ray-to-optical flux ratios, log f X\/f opt \u0002\n\u22122, are believed to be quiescent Milky Way type galaxies\n(Hornschemeier et al. 2002; Georgakakis et al. 2003a;\nHornschemeier et al. 2003) although the presence of heavily ob-\nscured AGNs cannot be excluded.\nDeep Chandra surveys have provided valuable information on\nthe nature of low f X\/f opt sources at fluxes f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u0002 10\u221217\u2013\n10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. These surveys are not, however, suitable for\nthe study of low f X\/f opt sources at brighter fluxes because of the\nChandra small field of view (\u22480.07 deg2). Indeed, due to the low\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n136 A. Georgakakis et al.\nsurface density of these sources at bright fluxes, wide-area surveys\nare required to compile large statistically complete samples to elu-\ncidate their nature.\nThe ROSAT satellite with a field of view of \u22480.30 deg2 per point-\ning has probed the bright flux regime [f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u2248 10\u221215 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122] but has identified only a small number of low X-ray-to-optical\nflux ratio sources (Griffiths et al. 1995, 1996; Georgantopoulos\net al. 1996; Lehmann et al. 2001). This can be attributed to (i) the\npoor positional accuracy of ROSAT , rendering the optical identifi-\ncation of X-ray sources difficult, and (ii) its low sensitivity, making\nwide-area surveys to the limit f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u2248 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\ntime-consuming. The latter is particularly true due to the low surface\ndensity on the sky of sources with log f X\/f opt \u0002\u22121 to the flux limit\nabove. Therefore large surveyed regions are required to compile\nstatistically complete samples of such sources to the limiting flux\nf X (0.5\u20132 KeV) \u2248 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. Moreover, the insensitivity\nof ROSAT to hard X-rays (>2.5 keV) is a major drawback since\nheavily obscured AGNs (believed to populate the log f X\/f opt \u0002\u22121\nregime) are expected to emit most of their X-ray energy output in\nthis spectral band.\nIn this paper we employ a shallow (2\u201310 ks) wide-area\n(\u22482.5 deg2) XMM\u2013Newton survey to explore the nature of the log\nf X\/f opt \u0002 \u22121 sources to the limit f (0.5\u20138 keV) \u2248 10\u221214 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 similar to that probed by previous ROSAT surveys. Compared\nto ROSAT , XMM\u2013Newton has the advantage of significantly higher\nsensitivity over a wide energy range (0.2\u201310 keV) and improved\npositional accuracy (\u00023.5 arcsec; Hasinger et al. 2001; McHardy\net al. 2003) facilitating the optical identification of X-ray sources.\nOur XMM\u2013Newton observations (hereafter referred to as the XMM\u2013\nNewton\/2dF survey) cover an area of \u22482.5 deg2 much larger than\nany previous ROSAT surveys at the same flux limit. This is essential\nto compile a large sample of low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio sources\nto explore their nature and to constrain the relative fraction of the\ndifferent X-ray populations. An advantage of the data presented here\nis that unlike deep Chandra samples (e.g. Brandt et al. 2001) lim-\nited by the small field of view, the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey has\nsufficient areal coverage to probe the low-z (z\u0002 0.1) Universe. This\nis essential to explore the nature of the relatively nearby X-ray pop-\nulation and to provide a link between local (<100 Mpc) and more\ndistant samples.\nMoreover, our XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey has the advantage of\nhigh-quality follow-up optical spectroscopic and photometric ob-\nservations. Apart from our own spectroscopic campaign the XMM\u2013\nNewton\/2dF overlaps with large-scale spectroscopic programmes:\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the 2dF Galaxy and\nQSO Redshift Surveys (2dFGRS and 2QZ, respectively). These un-\nprecedented spectroscopic data bases are complemented by a homo-\ngeneous set of multi-waveband (ugriz) photometric data from the\nSDSS available for part of our XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey.\nSection 2 presents the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey, Section 3 de-\nscribes the reduction of the X-ray data, while Sections 4 and 5 detail\nthe optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, respec-\ntively. In Section 6 we outline the optical identification method,\nwhile Section 7 presents the sample employed in this study. The\nresults are discussed in Section 8. Finally Section 9 summarizes\nour conclusions. Throughout this paper we adopt H0 = 65 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121, \u0007M = 0.3 and \u0007\b = 0.7.\n2 T H E X M M\/2 D F S U RV E Y\nThe North Galactic Pole F864 region [RA(J2000) = 13h41m;\nDec.(J2000) = 00\u25e600\u2032] and the South Galactic Pole [SGP;\nRA(J2000) = 00h57m, Dec.(J2000) = \u221228\u25e600\u2032] were surveyed by\nXMM\u2013Newton between 2002 May and 2003 February as part of the\nGuaranteed Time programme. The observations consist of a total of\n18 pointings split between the SGP (total of five) and the F864 (total\nof eight) regions each with an exposure time of \u22482\u201310 ks. Part of this\ndata set was presented by Georgakakis et al. (2003a). In the present\npaper the Georgakakis et al. (2003a) observations are supplemented\nby a total of three additional pointings recently obtained by XMM\u2013\nNewton in the F864 region. These three fields suffered from elevated\nparticle background or instrumental problems and were reobserved\nby XMM\u2013Newton between 2003 January and February. The EPIC\n(European Photon Imaging Camera; Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001; Turner et al.\n2001) cameras were operated in full frame mode with the thin filter\napplied.\nBoth the F864 and SGP regions overlap with the 2dF Galaxy\nRedshift Survey (2dFGRS1; Colless et al. 2001) and the 2dF QSO\nRedshift Survey (2QZ2; Croom et al. 2001). Both the 2dFGRS and\n2QZ are large-scale spectroscopic campaigns that fully exploit the\ncapabilities of the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the 4-m Anglo-\nAustralian Telescope (AAT). These on-going projects aim to ob-\ntain high-quality spectra, redshifts and spectral classifications for\n250 000 bj < 19.4-mag galaxies and 25 000 optically selected bj <\n20.85-mag QSOs.\nIn addition to 2dF spectroscopy, the F864 region overlaps with\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000). The SDSS is an\non-going imaging and spectroscopic survey that aims to cover about\n10 000 deg2 of the sky. Photometry is performed in five bands (ugriz;\nFukugita et al. 1996; Stoughton et al. 2002) to the limiting magnitude\ng \u2248 23 mag, providing a uniform and homogeneous multicolour\nphotometric catalogue. The SDSS spectroscopic observations will\nobtain spectra for over a million objects, including galaxies brighter\nthan r = 17.7 mag, luminous red galaxies to z \u2248 0.45 and colour-\nselected QSOs (York et al. 2000; Stoughton et al. 2002).\nUnlike the F864 area, the SGP region does not have complete and\nhomogeneous CCD photometric coverage. In the absence of good-\nquality photometry for this field we use photographic data from the\nAPM survey calibrated to the Johnson\u2013Cousin B-band using CCD\nphotometry available for a subregion of the SGP field.\n3 X - R AY DATA\nA full description of the X-ray data reduction and the generation\nof the PN and MOS event files is presented by Georgakakis et al.\n(2003a). To increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to reach fainter\nfluxes the PN and the MOS event files have been combined into\na single event list using the MERGE task of SAS. Images have been\nextracted in the spectral bands 0.5\u20138 (total), 0.5\u20132 (soft) and 2\u2013\n8 keV (hard) for both the merged and the individual PN and MOS\nevent files. We use the more sensitive (higher signal-to-noise ra-\ntio) merged image for source extraction and flux estimation, while\nthe individual PN and MOS images are used to calculate hard-\nness ratios. This is because the interpretation of hardness ratios\nis simplified if the extracted count rates are from one detector\nonly.\nSource extraction is performed in the 0.5\u20138 keV merged image\nusing the EWAVELET task of SAS with a detection threshold of 5\u03c3 .\nThe extracted sources for each field were visually inspected and\nspurious detections clearly associated with CCD gaps, hot pixels or\n1 http:\/\/msowww.anu.edu.au\/2dFGRS\/\n2 http:\/\/www.2dfquasar.org\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 349, 135\u2013145\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey \u2013 II 137\nlying close to the edge of the field of view were removed. The final\ncatalogue comprises a total of 516 X-ray sources to the limit f X(0.5\u2013\n8 keV) \u2248 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. Source detection using the EWAVELET\ntask of SAS with a detection threshold of 5\u03c3 is also performed in the\nindividual soft (0.5\u20132 keV) and hard (2\u20138 keV) band merged images.\nA total of 483 and 175 sources are detected in the individual 0.5\u20132\nand 2\u20138 keV bands, respectively, to the 5\u03c3 detection threshold.\nCount rates in the merged (PN + MOS) images as well as the\nindividual PN and MOS images are estimated within an 18-arcsec\naperture. For the background estimation we use the background\nmaps generated as a by-product of the EWAVELET task of SAS. A\nsmall fraction of sources lie close to masked regions (CCD gaps\nor hot pixels) on either the MOS or the PN detectors. This may\nintroduce errors in the estimated source counts. To avoid this bias,\nthe source count rates (and hence the hardness ratios and the flux)\nare estimated using the detector (MOS or PN) with no masked pixels\nin the vicinity of the source.\nTo convert count rates to flux the energy conversion factors (ECFs)\nof individual detectors are calculated assuming a power-law spec-\ntrum with \n = 1.7 and Galactic absorption NH = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\nappropriate for both the SGP and the F864 fields. The mean ECF\nfor the mosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting the\nECFs of individual detectors by the respective exposure time. For\nthe encircled energy correction, accounting for the energy fraction\noutside the aperture within which source counts are accumulated,\nwe adopt the calibration given by the XMM\u2013Newton calibration\ndocumentation.3\n4 O P T I C A L P H OTO M E T R I C DATA\nThe F864 region overlaps with the SDSS (York et al. 2000) Early\nData Release (EDR; Stoughton et al. 2002; http:\/\/www.sdss.org).\nMultiwaveband photometric observations (ugriz-filters; Fukugita\net al. 1996) are available to the limiting magnitude r \u2248 23 mag\nwith the star\u2013galaxy separation being reliable to r = 21 mag. In the\npresent study the colour transformations of Fukugita et al. (1996) are\nused to convert SDSS g-band magnitudes to the standard Johnson\u2013\nCousin B-band.\nIn the SGP region in the absence of homogeneous CCD photom-\netry we use data from the APM survey. These are calibrated to the\nstandard Johnson\u2013Cousin B-band using CCD broad-band photom-\netry available for one of our X-ray pointings, SGP-2 [RA(J2000) =\n00h57m00s, Dec.(J2000) = \u221227\u25e636\u203200\u2032].\nPhotometric observations of this field in the Sloan gri filters were\ncarried out at the AAT in 2000 December 27 using the Wide Field\nImager (WFI). The WFI was mounted at the prime focus of AAT\ngiving a pixel size of 0.225 arcsec pixel\u22121 and a field of view of\n30 \u00d7 30 arcmin2. The total integration times were 2400 s in all three\nbands split into four separate 600-s exposures. The observations\nwere reduced following standard procedures using Starlink and IRAF\ntasks. Photometric calibration was performed using standard stars\nfrom Landolt (1992). These provide the instrumental zero-point, the\natmospheric extinction relation and the colour terms for the conver-\nsion from Sloan filters to the standard Johnson\u2013Cousin system used\nby Landolt. The uncertainty in the zero-point estimated using these\nstandard stars is \u00b10.05 mag in all three bands.

A detailed description of these ob-\nservations including data reduction, source extraction and catalogue\ngeneration will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Vallbe\u00b4 et al.,\nin preparation).\nOptical sources (both stars and galaxies) within the XMM\u2013\nNewton\/2dF survey SGP region are selected from the APM scans\nof the UKST bj plates.4 The APM magnitudes are recalibrated to\nthe Johnson\u2013Cousin B-band using our CCD photometry.\nFirst, the APM and the CCD source catalogues are cross-\ncorrelated using a 2-arcsec matching radius to identify com-\nmon objects. We find 843 overlapping sources of which 375 are\ngalaxies and 468 are classified stars by APM. These sources are\nused to estimate the calibration curve, B = f (mbj), giving the stan-\ndard Johnson\u2013Cousin B-band magnitude as a function of uncali-\nbrated APM magnitude mbj. Since the APM magnitudes are not\ncorrected for emulsion saturation the calibration curve is expected\nto be non-linear. Following Maddox et al. (1990) we approximate\nf (mbj) using second- and third-order polynomials for galaxies and\nstars, respectively (on the basis of the APM classification). The poly-\nnomial fitting residuals for both galaxies and stars follow a Gaussian\ndistribution with an rms of \u22480.2 mag. This is the 1\u03c3 uncertainty of\nthe calibrated APM magnitudes.\n5 O P T I C A L S P E C T RO S C O P I C DATA\nIn addition to publicly available spectroscopic data from 2dFGRS,\n2QZ and the SDSS spectroscopic surveys we have initiated our\nown follow-up spectroscopic campaign of the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF\nsources. A detailed description of these observations will be pre-\nsented in a forthcoming paper (Georgakakis et al., in preparation).\nIn brief, X-ray sources in the F864 region of the XMM\u2013\nNewton\/2dF survey with optical counterparts brighter than B =\n22 mag were selected for multifibre spectroscopy using 2dF at the\nprime focus of the AAT. The 2dF consists of two spectrographs and\ntwo 1024 \u00d7 1024 thinned Tektronix CCDs each receiving 200 fi-\nbres. The fibres are \u000b2 arcsec in diameter resulting in 2-pixel-wide\nspectra on the detectors.\nThe data were obtained in service time mode during 2003 March\n26. Due to poor weather conditions at the time of the observation\nthe total exposure time was limited to 1 h split into two half-hour\nintegrations. The grating used was the 300B providing a dispersion\nof 4.3 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 and a wavelength resolution of \u22489 \u00c5 (\u000b2 pixel\nFWHM) over the range 3700\u20137900 \u00c5.\nThe data reduction was performed using the pipeline reduction\npackage 2DFDR developed for the reduction of the 2dF data. Fibre\nflat-fields were employed to determine the positions of the fibre\nspectra on each CCD frame and to flat-field the data. A CuArHe arc\nlamp exposure was then used for the wavelength calibration. Red-\nshifts were determined by visual inspection of the resulting spectra.\nFlux calibration has not been performed. This is due to the diffi-\nculty in obtaining absolute flux calibration for the 2dF fibres which\ncan differ substantially in their throughput. This also applies to the\n2dFGRS data. Therefore when presenting optical spectra (see Fig. 2\nbelow) we plot raw counts as a function of wavelength.\n6 O P T I C A L I D E N T I F I C AT I O N\nTo optically identify the sources detected in the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF\nsurvey we follow the method described by Downes et al.

Georgakakis et al.\ncalculate the probability a given candidate is the true identification\nusing Bayes\u2019 theorem: Consider an optically detected candidate with\nmagnitude m at a distance r from the X-ray position. Given the\nsurface density of objects brighter than m, \u000b(<m), the expected\nnumber of candidates within r is\n\u00b5 = \u03c0r 2\u000b(< m). (1)\nAssuming that source positions are Poissonian, the probability of at\nleast one object brighter than m within radius r is\nP = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u00b5), (2)\nwhich reduces to\u00b5 for\u00b5\r1. In this case, the candidate is unlikely to\nbe a chance association. In the present study we apply an upper limit\nin the search radius, r < 7 arcsec, and a cut-off in the probability,\nP < 0.05, to limit the optical identifications to those candidates that\nare least likely to be spurious alignments. The background density\nof sources (both galaxies and stars) in the Johnson\u2013Cousin B-band\nis estimated using the SDSS g-band converted to the B-band using\nthe transformations of Fukugita et al. (1996). At magnitudes fainter\nthan B = 22.5 mag where SDSS is affected by incompleteness we\nuse the B-band surface density of Metcalfe, Fong & Shanks (1995).\nIn the F864 region for the optical identification we only consider\nSDSS sources brighter than B = 22.5 mag to avoid the SDSS in-\ncompleteness at fainter magnitudes. Similarly, in the SGP region we\nonly consider APM sources brighter than B = 21.5 mag.\nWe propose 164 candidate optical identifications out of 291 0.5\u2013\n8 keV selected sources in the F864 region and 57 identifications out\nof 223 X-ray sources in the SGP region.\nThe probability P above is estimated under the assumption that\nthe source positions follow the Poisson distribution.

Most of the\nobjects in the latter class are likely to be Galactic stars on the basis\nof their optical and X-ray properties.\nWe note that by LLAGN (e.g. class (iii) above) we refer to sources\nthat show evidence for AGN activity and have X-ray luminosity\nLX \u0002 1042 erg s\u22121 (e.g. Elvis, Soltan & Keel 1984). Indeed, the\nX-ray sources classified as LLAGNs in our sample are nearby galax-\nies (z \u0002 0.1) with X-ray luminosities L(0.5\u20138 keV) \u2248 1042 erg s\u22121\nlower than those of distant QSOs.

We note that although the X-ray and op-\ntical properties of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy candidates are consistent with a\nstellar origin for the X-ray emission we cannot exclude the possi-\nbility of LLAGN.\n8 D I S C U S S I O N\nIn the present study we use the wide-area XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF sur-\nvey to study low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio sources (log f X\/f opt <\n\u22120.9) to the survey limit f (0.5\u20138 keV) \u224810\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122.

Out of 26 sources with log f X\/f opt < \u22120.9 we find: (i)\neight spectroscopically confirmed Galactic stars, (ii) seven broad-\nline QSOs, (iii) three LLAGNs (for a definition of the LLAGN class\nsee Section 7) of which one shows broad optical lines and the other\ntwo have absorption and\/or narrow emission lines, (iv) two \u2018normal\u2019\ngalaxy candidates and (v) six unclassified sources with no optical\nspectroscopic information, most of which are likely to be Galac-\ntic stars. The dominant populations to the flux limit of the present\nsurvey are Galactic stars and broad-line QSOs with only a small\nfraction of LLAGNs and \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy candidates. The relative\nmix of the low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio population found here is\nin fair agreement with the ROSAT High-Resolution Imager (HRI)\nresults of Lehmann et al.

Recent deep Chandra surveys\ndemonstrated beyond any doubt the appearance of \u2018normal\u2019 galax-\nies at faint X-ray fluxes (\u0002 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122; Bauer et al. 2002;\nHornschemeier et al. 2002). Hornschemeier et al. (2003) used the 2-\nMs CDF-N survey to compile the first large X-ray-selected sample of\ndistant (median redshift \u22480.3) quiescent galaxies with log f X\/f opt\u0002\n\u22122.3. They demonstrated that these systems comprise a non-\nnegligible fraction (\u224815 per cent) of the X-ray population at f (0.5\u20132\nkeV) \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and that their log N\u2013log S rises\nmuch steeper than the general X-ray source population. The major-\nity of the spectroscopically identified sources in the Hornschemeier\net al. (2003) sample are emission-line galaxies most likely to be\nstar-forming spirals in the redshift range 0.06 \u0002 z \u0002 0.85.\nOur shallow wide-area XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey complements\nthe Hornschemeier et al.

Fig. 5 plots the\ncumulative \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy counts from the present sample (i.e.\nthe two \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies identified here) and the CDF-N survey\n(Hornschemeier et al. 2003). Clearly, our surface density constraints\nsuffer from small-number statistics (e.g. only two \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy\ncandidates). We note, however, that the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey\nwith its wide field of view provides the only constraints to date to\nthe surface density of the rare X-ray-selected \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at\nthe flux limit of \u224810\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122.\nExtrapolating the Hornschemeier et al.

The\ndotted line is the fluctuation analysis constraints of Miyaji & Griffiths (2002)\nand should be regarded as an upper limit to the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy counts.\nfactor of \u22485. However, taking into account the uncertainties in both\nour sample and that of Hornschemeier et al. (2003) there is agree-\nment between the two studies. Also, we note that Hornschemeier\net al. (2003) select only sources with log f X\/f opt \u0002 \u22122.3, i.e. qui-\nescent low star-formation rate systems. This conservative selection\nthreshold was chosen to avoid LLAGN contamination but is also\nlikely to miss active star-forming galaxies expected to have \u22121 \u0002\nlog f X\/f opt \u0002 \u22122 (Alexander et al. 2002; Bauer et al. 2002).\nAlso shown in Fig. 5 are the constraints from the stacking anal-\nysis results of Georgakakis et al. (2003a). These authors used the\nXMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey to estimate the mean X-ray properties\nof optically selected 2dFGRS spirals\/ellipticals at a mean redshift\nof z \u2248 0.1 by applying stacking methods. A statistically significant\nstacking signal was found for both the elliptical and the spiral galaxy\nsubsamples providing an estimate of the mean X-ray flux of these\nsystems. We plot the surface density of the spiral galaxy sample\nused by Georgakakis et al. (2003a) at the mean X-ray flux of these\nsystems estimated via stacking. This point is a lower limit since it\nrepresents only a subset of the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy population at the\ngiven flux limit.\nThe fluctuation analysis results of Miyaji & Griffiths (2002) are\nshown in Fig. 5. The log N\u2013log S constraints of these authors refer\nto the whole X-ray population (e.g. including AGNs) and not just\nthe \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy subsample. Nevertheless, it has been suggested\nthat \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies are likely to outnumber AGNs at faint fluxes\n(Hornschemeier et al. 2003) and therefore the Miyaji & Griffiths\n(2002) results are likely to be relevant to \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at faint\nfluxes. In any case, the constraints provided by these authors are an\nupper limit to the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy counts.\nThe model log N\u2013log S prediction using the X-ray luminosity\nfunction derived by Georgantopoulos, Basilakos & Plionis (1999)\nfor H II galaxies is also plotted in Fig. 5. These authors convolved the\nlocal optical luminosity function of the Ho, Filippenko & Sargent\n(1995) sample with the corresponding LX\u2013LB relation based on\nEinstein data to derive the X-ray luminosity function of different\ngalaxy types. The galaxy classification scheme of the Ho et al. (1995)\nsample is highly reliable since it is based on high signal-to-noise\nratio nuclear optical spectra (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997). Dif-\nferent X-ray luminosity evolution scenarios of the form LX \u223c (1 +\nz)k are plotted. The difference between these two models at the flux\nrange plotted here is small because the predicted mean redshift of\nstar-forming galaxies at the flux limit f (0.5\u20138 keV) \u2248 10\u221216 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 remains low. This is in agreement with the mean redshift\nof \u22480.3 of the Hornschemeier et al. (2003) deep \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy\nsample.\nThe k = 3 evolutionary model is in fair agreement with both the\nHornschemeier et al. (2003) and our log N\u2013log S estimates. Al-\nthough the Georgantopoulos et al. (1999) model is flatter (slope =\n\u22121.5) than the Hornschemeier et al. (2003) log N\u2013log S (slope\n= \u22121.74+0.28\u22120.30), within the 1\u03c3 uncertainties there is fair agreement.\nAlso, the k = 3 model is in better agreement with the Hornschemeier\net al. (2003) observations over a wider flux range compared to the\nk = 0 model. Although the difference between the two models is\nmarginal in the flux range covered by the Hornschemeier et al.\n(2003) data the evidence above provides weak evidence for X-ray\nevolution of star-forming systems. As already discussed the mean\nredshift of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at the flux limits probed by Horn-\nschemeier et al. (2003) is low and therefore any evolutionary effects\nare expected to be small. Deeper X-ray observations are required to\ndetect \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at moderate and high redshifts to constrain\ntheir evolution better.\n9 C O N C L U S I O N S\nIn this paper we employ a wide-field (2.5 deg2) shallow [f X(0.5\u2013\n8 keV) \u2248 10\u221214 erg s\u22121] XMM\u2013Newton survey to investigate the na-\nture of low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio sources, log f X\/f opt < \u22120.9.\nOur sample comprises 26 objects of which 20 have optical spec-\ntroscopic information. The majority of the sources without spec-\ntroscopic information have X-ray\/optical properties that strongly\nsuggest Galactic stars. Most of the spectroscopically identified sys-\ntems are Galactic stars (a total of eight) and broad-line AGNs (a\ntotal of eight).\nWe also find four sources with narrow emission- and\/or\nabsorption-line optical spectra. Two of them have X-ray\/optical\nproperties suggesting LLAGN activity. The remaining two sources\nhave narrow emission-line optical spectra, X-ray luminosities LX \u2248\n1041 erg s\u22121 and X-ray-to-optical flux ratios \u2248 \u22122, suggesting \u2018nor-\nmal\u2019 galaxies powered by star-formation activity.\nThe small number of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies found in our wide-field\nXMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey is in agreement with the results from the\n1-Ms ROSAT HRI survey of the Lockman Hole. Despite the poor\nstatistics the estimated number density of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at the\nflux limit probed here is consistent with the log N\u2013log S of deeper\nChandra surveys extrapolated to bright fluxes. Using the X-ray lu-\nminosity function of local star-forming galaxies we find that the\npredicted log N\u2013log S is in fair agreement with both our shallow\nand the deeper Chandra samples. The pure luminosity evolution\nmodel is in better agreement with the observations compared to the\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 349, 135\u2013145\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n144 A.

However, the difference between the\ntwo models even at the flux limits of the 2-Ms Chandra Deep Field\nNorth survey is small and does not allow firm conclusions to be\ndrawn. This is because of the low mean redshift (z \u2248 0.3) of the\n\u2018normal\u2019 galaxies probed by this ultra-deep survey.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments and sug-\ngestions.

Also, inspection of the X-ray centroid overlaid on the\nSDSS optical image in Fig. 1 provides additional evidence that TGN\n336Z130 is likely to be the correct counterpart of the X-ray source.\nIn what follows we assume that TGN 336Z130 is the correct identi-\nfication. The 2dFGRS optical spectrum of this B = 17.6-mag system\nexhibits absorption lines only, suggesting an early-type galaxy, most\nlikely an E\/S0. The X-ray-to-optical flux ratio of \u2248 \u22121.5 and the\nX-ray luminosity LX(0.5\u20138 keV) \u2248 8 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 are consistent\nwith those of \u2018normal\u2019 ellipticals with X-ray emission due to a hot\ngaseous halo. The upper limit of the hardness ratio (HR < 0.05)\nindicates moderate photoelectric absorption \u00026 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (\n =\n1.7). We note that the optical and X-ray properties of this source\nare reminiscent of those of X-ray-bright optically inactive galax-\nies (Griffiths et al. 1995; Fiore et al. 2000; Comastri et al. 2002).\nApart from the presence of a hot interstellar medium, other scenar-\nios for the origin of the X-ray emission of TGN 336Z130 include (i)\nhot gas from a galaxy group, (ii) radiatively inefficient advection-\ndominated accretion flow (ADAF), (iii) a low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line region (LINER) and (iv) a heavily obscured AGN.\nThe X-ray source associated with TGN 336Z130 is not extended,\nthus excluding the possibility of group emission.

This\nis particularly true in the case of spectra obtained through wide slits\nor fibres (like 2dF) that are contaminated by non-nuclear emission\nfrom the host galaxy (e.g. Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997; Moran,\nFilippenko & Chornock 2002; Severgnini et al. 2003). Comastri\net al. (2002) in their multiwavelength study of FIORE-P3, the pro-\ntotype of X-ray-bright optically inactive systems, favour the heavily\nobscured Compton thick AGN scenario with the observed X-ray\nemission arising from a scattered nuclear component. However, for\nTGN 336Z130 this possibility is inconsistent with the observed soft\nX-ray spectral properties of this source. We adopt a conservative\napproach and classify TGN 336Z130 as an AGN. The low X-ray\nluminosity suggests a LLAGN. We note, however, that this may also\nbe a \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy with the X-ray emission arising from the hot\ninterstellar medium.\nTGN 336Z208\nThe optical counterpart of this X-ray source has extended optical\nlight profile. Inspection of the SDSS image in Fig. 1 suggests a\nspiral galaxy morphology. The 2dFGRS spectrum reveals a broad-\nline AGN at z = 0.0736. The X-ray luminosity of this source is\nLX(0.5\u20138) =1.8 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121; although this is elevated compared\nto \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies, it is lower than that of distant QSOs. The\nX-ray-to-optical flux ratio of \u2248 \u22121 places this galaxy in the border-\nline between AGNs and \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies. The estimated hardness\nratio, HR =\u22120.51 \u00b1 0.15, suggests a soft X-ray spectrum consistent\nwith the observed broad optical lines.\nTGN 336Z232\nThe 2dFGRS optical spectrum of this system suggests an early-type\nspiral with both emission (H\u03b1, [N II] 6583 \u00c5, [O II] 3727 \u00c5) and ab-\nsorption (H+K, H\u03b2, H\u03b3 , H\u03b4, NaD5893 \u00c5) lines. For the [O II] 3727\n\u00c5 and the H\u03b4 lines we estimate equivalent widths of EW[O II] \u2248 12\n(emission) and EWH\u03b4 \u2248 \u22128 \u00c5 (absorption), respectively. On the ba-\nsis of the Dressler et al. (1999) classification scheme TGN 336Z232\nis an e(a)-type galaxy. Poggianti et al. (1999) suggest that the optical\nspectral properties of this class of galaxies can be explained by a\nstarburst event followed by a period of very low star-formation ac-\ntivity. They also argue that in the local Universe, e(a)-type galaxies\nare frequently associated with dusty interacting\/merging systems.\nAssuming that the [O II] 3727 \u00c5 line of TGN 336Z232 is due to star\nformation, the observed X-ray emission may arise from a starburst\nevent in the recent past. The X-ray-to-optical flux ratio of \u22121.5 and\nthe X-ray luminosity, LX(0.5\u20138) \u22488 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121, cannot discrim-\ninate between an AGN or X-ray properties dominated by stellar\nprocesses. The 3\u03c3 upper limit of the hardness ratio (HR < 0.44)\ncorresponds to photoelectric absorption \u00021.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (\n =\n1.7) and cannot strongly constrain the X-ray spectral properties or\nthe nature of this source. We adopt a conservative approach and\nclassify this source as an AGN. The low X-ray luminosity suggests\na LLAGN.\nUM 603\nThis narrow emission-line galaxy is classified as H II on the basis of\nits optical spectral properties (Terlevich et al. 1991). Its X-ray lu-\nminosity LX(0.5\u20138) = 1.5 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 and X-ray-to-optical flux\nratio \u2248 \u22122.1 also suggest a \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy. Moreover, this source\nis not detected in the hard band, suggesting a soft X-ray spec-\ntrum, HR < \u22120.14, consistent with stellar origin of the X-ray\nemission.\nTGN 336Z243\nIn the SDSS optical image this galaxy appears to be interacting with\na nearby smaller system. The X-ray centroid is offset by 3 arcsec\nfrom the optical centre of the galaxy. This is a narrow emission-line\nsystem at z = 0.0717 showing a [O III] 4959+5007 \u00c5 doublet, H\u03b1\nand [N II] 6583 \u00c5. Although the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum\nis low, H\u03b2 is not visible in emission. This, coupled with the strong\n[O III] 5007 \u00c5 feature, may suggest a Seyfert 2 type system. A\nhardness ratio has not been estimated for this source because it\nis not detected in either the 0.5\u20132 keV or the 2\u20138 keV images to\nthe formal EWAVELET detection threshold of 5\u03c3 . Moreover, the low\nX-ray luminosity LX(0.5\u20138) = 1.9 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 and X-ray-to-\noptical flux ratio \u2248 \u22122.0 are consistent with a \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy\npowered by stellar processes.\nB005615.26-275548.8\nThe X-ray centroid lies 5 arcsec off the optical source centre. The\nprobability of chance coincidence is 1.5 per cent. The counterpart\nof the X-ray source (assuming it is the correct one) is optically\nextended and has no optical spectroscopic information. The optical-\nto-X-ray flux ratio of \u2248 \u22121.6 places this source in the \u2018normal\u2019\ngalaxy regime. The upper limit of the hardness ratio (HR < 0.40)\nindicates photoelectric absorption\u00021.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (\n = 1.7) and\ncannot strongly constrain the X-ray spectral properties or the nature\nof this source. On the basis of the above evidence alone we cannot\ndecide the nature of this source.\nOther sources\nA number sources (ID numbers #3, 12, 20, 23, 26 in Table 1) in\nthe present sample have no optical spectral information. However,\nthey share common properties: unresolved optical light profile, soft\nX-ray spectra and low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, that strongly sug-\ngest Galactic stars. Sources in the North Galactic Pole region (#3,\n#12) also have colour information from the SDSS. Source #3, how-\never, is too bright (B \u2248 13.5 mag) and saturated on the SDSS images.\nThis does not allow meaningful colours to be estimated. Source #12\nhas g \u2212 r, u \u2212 g colours of 0.5 and 1.5, respectively, typical of stellar\ncolours (e.g. Stoughton et al. 2002, their fig. 13).\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX\/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 349, 135\u2013145\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n"}
