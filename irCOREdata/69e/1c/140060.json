This may be because organisations\nexperience mixed success in using online methods of recruitment. This paper\nreports on the use of a large scale, longitudinal survey of recruitment activity\nto investigate the usage and perceived success of both corporate and\ncommercial websites by employers. In addition, twenty interviews with users\nand providers of online recruitment were conducted, in order to provide a\ndeeper exploration of the factors that may affect the success of these\nmethods. The results provide valuable insights into the use and success of\nonline recruitment in the UK and have strong implications for practitioners.\n3AN ANALYSIS OF THE USE AND SUCCESS OF ONLINE RECRUITMENT\nMETHODS IN THE UK\nIntroduction\nThe Internet first emerged as a recruiting tool in the mid-1990s and was hailed\nin the popular management press as the driver behind a \u2018recruiting revolution\u2019\ndue to the benefits it could bring to recruiters (Boydell, 2002). Indeed some\nauthors suggested that the Internet had \u2018revolutionised the way that people\nlook for work\u2019 (Birchfield, 2002) and brought \u2018radical change to corporate\nrecruiting\u2019 (Cappelli, 2001). There has been little empirical research to\ninvestigate whether these predictions have been realised, despite extensive\nuse of the methods. We will examine the use of online recruitment and\nperceptions of its success in comparison to other methods in the UK by the\nyear 2006 through our longitudinal dataset and interviews. We will then\nanalyse our data to discover whether the successful use of online recruitment\nis limited to particular types of organisations or whether its success is\ndetermined by how employers use online recruitment systems.\nThe Internet as a recruitment method\nRecruitment \u201cincludes those practices and activities carried out by the\norganisation with the primary purpose of identifying and attracting potential\nemployees\u201d (Breaugh & Starke, 2000, p. 405) and has long been regarded as\nan important part of human resource management as it 'performs the\n4essential function of drawing an important resource - human capital- into the\norganisation' (Barber, 1998, p. 841). The strategic significance of recruitment\nis often reported in the literature (Boxall and Purcell, 2003), the emphasis\nbeing upon the need to attract and retain high quality people in order to gain a\ncompetitive advantage, as is consistent with the resource-based view (Barney\n1991; Barney and Wright, 1998; Wright and McMahon, 1992).\nLabour market shortages and recruitment difficulties have led to a more\ncompetitive recruitment market in the last decade. Lievens, van Dam and\nAnderson (2002) asserted that the 'war for talent' meant that the emphasis in\norganisations moved from the selection to the attraction of employees.\nIndeed, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)\nreported that 84% of organisations experienced recruitment difficulties (2007),\nindicating the continuing tight labour market conditions and the need to\nchoose appropriate ways to access labour markets. The already extensive\nrange of recruitment techniques available to organisations has been\naugmented further with the development of technologies such as Internet\nrecruitment.\nThe use of online recruitment has grown rapidly over the past ten years and\nthe Internet is now a widely adopted medium by both recruiters and job\nseekers within the UK and across the world. Arthur (2001) found that 96% of\nUS companies were online with spend on electronic advertising expected to\nrise from $48 million in 2001 to $460 million by 2006. More recently, Cober\nand Brown (2006) found that 50% new hires in the US were from online\n5sources. In the UK, online recruitment has become popular for both\norganisations and candidates. For instance, the CIPD (2006) found that 64%\nof UK organisations used e-recruitment, suggesting that the growth of the\nInternet as a recruitment tool has been considerable.\nIn the US at least, online recruitment has begun to displace other more\ntraditional recruitment methods. Feldman and Klass (2002) have described\nhow the Internet is \u2018clearly beginning to cut into other types of employment\nadvertising revenues\u2019 (pp. 2) such as newspaper advertising and head\nhunters. Boehle (2000) and Quick (1998) suggested that expenditure on\nnewspaper advertising and head hunter retainer fees have dropped 20% in\nthe US as spend on internet recruitment has increased.\nDespite the reported growth of the use of Internet recruitment, academic\nresearch regarding this topic in the UK is relatively sparse. Bartram (2000)\nnoted that: \u2018The topic of study is relatively new. As a consequence there has\nbeen little time for research to have been carried out and found its way into\nthe literature. A search of PsychLit for papers concerned with the Internet and\n\u2026 recruitment found nothing\u2019 (pp.261). The situation has changed very little\nsince Bartram\u2019s paper, with the majority of academic interest in online\nrecruitment being from the candidate\u2019s perspective rather than the employers\u2019.\nOur study will attempt to address this gap. As previous empirical research in\nthis area is so limited, we will adopt an exploratory approach and will therefore\nseek to answer broad research questions rather than to prove hypotheses.\nGiven the absence of longitudinal studies following the organisational use of\n6Internet recruitment, we undertook a longitudinal survey over a period of six\nyears so that trends in the use of Internet recruitment could be analysed. We\nbelieve these to be critical years, from 1999 to 2006, when the Internet\nbecame a popular means to communicate, and a source of new information.\nThe first question that this study will explore is:\nWhat trends are there in the use and perceived success of corporate websites\nand commercial jobs boards and what are the reasons behind these trends?\nIn order for online recruitment to have the impact on the recruitment process\nthat has been predicted, it would need to offer considerable advantages over\nother, more established, methods of recruitment such as print advertising.\nThe literature has provided a reasonably long list of the advantages of Internet\nrecruitment over other methods which included: cost effectiveness, access to\nmore people, the ability to target the people needed, access to applicants with\na technical and computing background, quicker response and turnaround\ntimes, ease of use and economy (Starke, 1996; Capelli, 2001; Galanaki,\n2002; Zusman and Landis, 2002). These suggestions have been supported\nby the CIPD (2006), in that 71% of their survey respondents used e-\nrecruitment to reduce recruiting costs, 60% to broaden the selection pool and\n47% to improve the speed of time to hire. Lin and Stasinskaya (2002)\ndiscussed the improved accuracy and verifiability of data through online\nsources and Cober, Brown and Levy (2004) described the interactivity and\nusability of corporate websites and the ability to present more information with\n7fewer spatial constraints and the opportunities for employers to draw on their\nbrands more effectively in attracting candidates.\nStarcke (1996) added to this list of benefits with a list of problems, including\nthe danger of being flooded with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, the increased volume of applicants,\ntracking difficulties and the fact that not everyone has access to the Internet.\nThis has been supported by empirical research by IRS Employment Review\n(2005) that found that 74% of organisations received inappropriate responses\nto advertisements on the Internet. The evidence indicates that the perceived\nsuccess of online recruitment may be mixed, but these assertions have not\nyet been fully explored empirically.\nThe second question that we will address as part of this study is:\nAre particular \u2018types\u2019 of organisations more successful at using online\nrecruitment methods than others?\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that online recruitment may initially have\nappealed particularly to graduates and highly technical organisations, where\ngood levels of computer literacy were assumed amongst the target labour\nmarket. However, there has been little investigation about whether online\nrecruitment methods are better suited for particular types of organisations, for\ninstance those of a particular size or in particular industries. Barber, Wesson,\nRobertson and Taylor (1999) suggested that the recruitment practices of small\nand large firms differ significantly. Hausdorf and Duncan (2004) however\n8failed to find differences in the use of companies\u2019 corporate websites for\nrecruitment in small and large firms. Wiley (1992) found some differences in\nthe effectiveness of 12 recruitment methods across occupational categories,\nbut did not include online methods in her study. There remains a question\ntherefore, as to whether the success of online recruitment is related to the\nkind of organisation using the method or if it is purely due to the nature and\nimplementation of the online method used. This issue will also be addressed\nin this study. Finally, in order to extend this exploration and provide useful\ninsight for practitioners, we will also consider the question:\nAre there steps that employers can take to improve their success at using\nonline recruitment methods?\nTo summarise, the purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the\nsuccess of online recruitment methods in more detail. An investigation into the\nuse of online recruitment and its effect on the use of other traditional\nrecruitment media, together with information on users\u2019 perceptions may allow\nus some insight into how successful this method is perceived to be within the\nUK. In addition, a more detailed examination of the use of online recruitment\nmethods within organisations may allow us to explore the factors that may\ndrive the success of online recruitment. To do this, we have supplemented\nthis survey research with interviews with employers and online recruitment\nproviders.\n9Method\n1. Survey\nA survey of recruitment activity, including the use of online recruitment, was\nconducted over the period of six years. This was a quarterly survey of HR\nManagers, which posed a number of questions covering all aspects of\nrecruitment including the organisational experience of recruitment difficulties\nand recruitment methods. Recruitment difficulties were not defined within the\nsurvey in order to focus on the respondent\u2019s own perception of the existence\nof recruitment difficulties at any one point in time. We are following a long\ntradition in the social sciences that if a person believes something to be true,\nto all intents and purposes, for that person, it is true and will guide their\nactions (Silverman, 1970). Organisations were also asked on a quarterly\nbasis whether they had used a corporate website or commercial website over\nthe past six months and whether this method had been successful. The\ncontext-specific nature of HRM and recruitment is such that definitions of\nsuccess will be different in different circumstances. For example, whilst we\nwould anticipate that size might be important, since in a small organisation,\nrecruitment timing is critical, this could also be true in large organisations for\nspecific roles or at moments of crisis. The continued use or adoption of online\nrecruitment is dependent on the recruiter\u2019s perception of the success of this\nmethod. As a consequence of this, the approach that we have taken is to\nwork with the respondent\u2019s own definition of success rather than to impose\nsome criteria of success that may or may not be appropriate. Our use of a\n10\nlarge longitudinal data and a longitudinal study is intended to reduce any\nproblems of individual bias on the part of respondents.\nAs the survey was first conducted in December (Q4) 1999, it was possible to\nidentify trends in the use of corporate and commercial websites for a period of\nover six years through surveys. Corporate websites were taken to be an\nemployer\u2019s own website, while commercial websites included jobs boards\nwhere organisations can pay to advertise a position. A further series of\nquestions regarding internet recruitment were asked in March (Q1) 2000,\nJune (Q2) 2001, June (Q2) 2002, June (Q2) 2003, June (Q2) 2004 and June\n(Q2) 2006. Respondents were asked a number of questions regarding why\nthey did or did not use online recruitment, whether they predicted their use of\nthe Internet for recruitment to change, and what impact they expected Internet\nrecruitment to have on their use of other recruitment methods. The questions\nwere developed through pilot surveys and employer practitioner feedback, as\nwell as exposure and discussion with the recruitment industry, including online\nrecruitment providers.\nThe survey was initially conducted as a paper-based survey but was changed\nto an online survey in 2001. The online and paper-based surveys were run in\nparallel for two quarters in order to ensure that the change in method of data\ncollection did not have an impact on the results. In each quarter the survey\nwas online for one month in total.\n11\nFor each quarter, including the June (Q2) 2006 survey, approximately 16,000\nemployers were contacted via email and were asked to complete the survey\nusing a web link that was included in the email. These potential respondents\nwere drawn from an electronic database of employers developed specifically\nby the authors for this purpose. From December (Q4) 2002 onwards, this\ndatabase was supplemented with a list of subscribers to a weekly UK HR\nmagazine. The survey was also advertised in a daily broadsheet newspaper\nand a weekly HR publication in order to maximise its reach to the target\npopulation of recruiters. Respondents included HR directors and managers,\nfinance directors, managing directors and recruitment specialists from a\nsample of UK organisations with over 25 employees. It was requested as part\nof the survey that the respondent should have the primary responsibility for\nrecruitment decision-making within their organisation.\n2. Interviews\n15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from\norganisations that use online recruitment methods. The interviewees were\nsenior HR or resourcing managers with responsibility for recruitment. While it\nis not possible to be representative of the population with only 15 interviews,\nparticipants from a range of organisations were included to allow some\nvariation by industry sector, organisation size and geographical location. The\norganisations also varied in their use of online recruitment methods. An\nadditional five interviews were conducted with providers of online recruitment\ntechnology in order to obtain a broader perspective. The purpose of these\ninterviews was to supplement the survey data with a more in-depth view of\n12\nwhat it is that may lead to, firstly, an organisation\u2019s decision to use online\nrecruitment and, secondly, their success at using online recruitment methods.\nInterviewees were asked to discuss their use of online recruitment, the\nreasons for their initial adoption of the method and the degree of success that\nthey had experienced with the method. They were also asked for their\nopinions on why their use of online recruitment had been successful or\nunsuccessful.\nEach interview was recorded and transcribed. The content of the interviews\nwas analysed using the content analysis software Nvivo in order to identify\ncommon themes.\nResults\nThe survey produced 25,224 responses over the period of December (Q4)\n1999 to June (Q2) 2006 (an average of 935 organisations per survey).\nFor the June (Q2) 2006 survey, 39% of responding organisations had\nbetween 25 and 199 employees, 33% had between 200 and 499 employees\nand 34% had over 500 employees. Responding organisations were evenly\nspread across the UK with between 20-30% having a base in each region. A\nslightly higher proportion (40%) had a base in London (34%).\nThe breakdown of respondents by industry sector showed that the responses\nwere broadly representative of the population, with 32% of the private sector\norganisations from manufacturing and 63% from the service sector. The\n13\nremaining 5% did not classify themselves as either manufacturing or services.\nTo ensure a representative picture, the results were weighted according to\nindustry, region and size.\nThe responses to the survey questions are presented below, in relation to\neach of the research questions. Where an in-depth exploration of the data is\npresented, this has been taken from the June (Q2) 2006 survey results, this\nbeing the most recent survey to examine online recruitment in detail. Under\neach question, the survey data has been supplemented with information from\nthe qualitative interviews.\nWhat trends are there in the use and perceived success of corporate\nwebsites and commercial jobs boards and what are the reasons behind\nthese trends?\nTake in Table 1\nThe results depicted in table 1 show that after an initial increase in the use of\nboth corporate and commercial websites, the proportion of organisations\nusing these methods levelled off. The use of commercial websites remained\nat approximately 25% since 2001, whereas the use of corporate websites was\nbetween 35% and 45% since 2002.\nSurvey respondents were also asked how their use of corporate and\ncommercial websites had changed during the past year. Virtually all\n14\nrespondents in June 2006 stated that their use of both corporate and\ncommercial websites had either increased (49% and 42% respectively) or\nremained the same (49% and 55% respectively) during the previous year to\nJune 2006.\nIn June 2004, organisations were also asked to indicate the reasons why they\nused corporate or commercial websites. The most common reasons were\ncost effectiveness (75%), followed by the ease of use for candidates (64%), a\nlarger candidate pool (53%), ease of use for the organisation (52%), speed to\nhire (52%) and company policy (50%). Less common reasons for using\ncorporate websites were the success in finding candidates (44%) and keeping\nahead of competitors (32%).\nThe most common reason for using commercial websites was access to a\nlarge candidate pool (74%), followed by cost effectiveness (66%), ease of use\nfor candidates (60%), speed to hire (56%) and success in finding candidates\n(51%). Less common reasons were ease of use for the organisation (45%),\nkeeping ahead of competitors (24%) and company policy (10%).\nThe interviewees who used online recruitment gave a number of reasons for\ntheir adoption of these methods. The majority of interviewees named the\nneed to reduce recruitment costs and to improve the efficiency of the\nrecruitment process as significant drivers for the adoption of both corporate\nand commercial websites. This is in support of the survey data. About half of\nthe interviewees also suggested that they were encouraged to adopt online\n15\nrecruitment by the need to \u201cmove with the times\u201d or to \u201ckeep up with other\norganisations\u201d and approximately a third of interviewees stated that they had\nintroduced online recruitment in order to improve the experience for\napplicants.\nTake in Table 2\nTable 2 shows that the perceived success of both corporate and commercial\nwebsites for recruitment had fluctuated over the six years of this study but had\nincreased slightly overall during this time. In fact, the perceived success of all\nof the methods examined had increased slightly during this period. This may\nbe a sign that recruiters were being more strategic in their choice of\nrecruitment channels to use to be successful for particular roles. Just under\nthree quarters of those organisations using corporate websites and two thirds\nof those using commercial websites for recruitment in Q2 2006 found the\nmethod successful, indicating that most of those organisations that do use the\nmethod perceive that they do so successfully. If we compare the perceived\nsuccess of corporate and commercial websites to other recruitment channels\nwe can see that online methods are certainly not seen as more successful\nthan these, and are less commonly perceived as successful than employment\nagencies.\nThe interviewees\u2019 experiences of the success of online recruitment were\nmixed. When asked to define how they conceptualised the success of online\nrecruitment, the majority of interviewees described success as generating\n16\nsufficient short-listable candidates or as enabling them to fill a vacancy. A\nnumber of interviewees had managed to attract good quality applicants\nthrough using the Internet, but this was not true for everyone.\nThose interviewees who had positive experiences of online recruitment\ndescribed how the use of either corporate websites or commercial jobs boards\ncould minimise the time taken to hire employees since posting advertisements\non the Internet is faster and they are no longer reliant on the mail. Online\nrecruitment was also commonly described as saving costs through reducing\npaper and saving on agency costs. One interviewee described how, before\nthey started to use their corporate website for recruitment, they were heavily\ndependent on agencies and other third-party recruiters. A number of\ninterviewees also commented that the use of their corporate websites in\nparticular, allowed them to promote their employer brand and provide a better\nservice to candidates.\nThe interviewees also discussed a number of difficulties in using online\nrecruitment. By far the most prevalent of these appeared to be the problem of\nreceiving very large numbers of applications, a high proportion of which were\nunsuitable for the position advertised. One interviewee commented that:\n\u201cIn the first few weeks we were horrified by the hundreds of people that\njust attached a CV and said I want a job. When you actually looked,\nthere was no connection between their skills and experience and\nanything we were asking for\u201d.\n17\nThere was also some concern from interviewees that, in addition to not having\nthe skills and experience for a job role, a high number of applications were\nalso received from non-UK citizens who did not have a permit to work within\nthe country. Another interviewee explained\n\u201cYou open the floodgates when you advertise on the web so you get\napplications in from everywhere. No matter what you put in the\nadvertisement about having a work permit you will get applications\nfrom everywhere in the world and that is a challenge sometimes to deal\nwith\u201d.\nOnline recruitment was therefore seen by some organisations as being\nresource intensive, especially when compared to agencies that sift candidates\non behalf of the company. There was also some doubt among interview\nrespondents as to whether they would find the candidates that they required\nthrough online recruitment methods, particularly through jobs boards. There\nwas particular concern about the ability to target passive job seekers and to\nreach a diverse population. A small number of respondents were concerned\nabout the impersonal nature of jobs boards and felt that they had a strong\nrelationship with people at agencies, which was absent in online recruitment.\nSurvey respondents in June 2004 were also asked, if they had stopped using\ncommercial jobs boards as recruitment methods, why they had done so. Of\nthe respondents, 59% stated that they had stopped using commercial\nwebsites because of the large number of responses from unsuitable\napplicants, whilst 52% had received a low response or no response at all to\nadvertisements on commercial jobs boards, and 24% felt that their sector was\n18\nnot represented. Around a quarter (23%) had stopped using commercial\nwebsites because they were not cost effective, 17% did not have the budget\nto continue using this method, and 16% had found the customer support to be\npoor. Commercial websites were found not to be user friendly by 14% of\nrespondents, 11% had had technical difficulties with internet use within the\norganisation and 5% had had technical difficulties with the website. This data\nwas in support of the information that emerged from our interviews.\nTake in Table 3\nTable 3 shows that the proportion of online recruitment users expecting to\nreduce their use of other methods due to online recruitment rose slightly from\n33% in June 2000 to 44% in June 2006. The same cannot be said however\nof non-online recruitment users with only 18% respondents expecting to\nreduce their use of other methods due to online recruitment in both 2000 and\n2006.\nAre particular \u2018types\u2019 of organisations more successful at using online\nrecruitment methods than others?\nThere was a perception among the users of online recruitment interviewed\nthat online methods are unsuitable for particular segments of the population.\nFor example, several of the interviewees expressed the opinion that online\nmethods are more suitable for knowledge workers and middle management\nand are less appropriate for blue collar jobs or very high level management.\n19\nIt was also felt that older workers and \u201chousewives\u201d could not be recruited\neffectively using the Internet. This was because it was felt that these groups\nwould not typically be using the Internet regularly. This point of view was\nrefuted however by the five providers of online recruitment services that were\ninterviewed. These individuals felt that Internet penetration was such that the\nmethod could be used across all levels and industries. An examination of the\nsurvey data allowed us to investigate this more objectively.\nAn examination of the survey data on the use and perceived success of online\nrecruitment by organisation size showed that larger organisations are\nsignificantly more likely both to use (Pearson chi-square = 20.26; p<0.01) and\nbe successful (Pearson chi-square = 10.93; p<0.05) in using their corporate\nwebsite for recruitment. The picture is not so clear however for commercial\njobs boards. While size is significant in terms of the use of jobs boards\n(Pearson chi-square = 16.60; p<0.01), it appears to be the medium sized\ncompanies that are most likely to choose this method. Size is not a significant\nfactor in the perceived successful use of commercial jobs boards.\nIndustry sector was shown to be a significant factor in the use of both\ncorporate (Pearson chi-square = 23.04; p<0.01) and commercial websites\n(Pearson chi-square = 7.40\u2019 p<0.05), with public and not for profit sector\norganisations more likely to use their corporate websites for recruitment and\nnot for profit organisations more likely to use commercial jobs boards. Industry\nsector was not significant in the perceived success of either corporate\nwebsites or commercial jobs boards.\n20\nOrganisations in the services sector were significantly more likely to use\ncommercial jobs boards compared to manufacturing organisations (Pearson\nchi-square = 10.96; p<0.01). However, there were no significant differences\nby sector in the use of corporate websites for recruitment or the perceived\nsuccess of corporate or commercial recruitment websites.\nThe use and perceived success of corporate and commercial websites was\nalso compared in organisations that did and did not experience recruitment\ndifficulties. Organisations who experienced recruitment difficulties were\nsignificantly more likely to use commercial jobs boards for recruitment\n(Pearson chi-square = 4.71, p<0.01). There were no differences in the use of\ncorporate websites for recruitment or the perceived success of either\ncorporate or commercial websites.\nThe proportion of organisations using corporate and commercial websites was\ncompared in those organisations that did or did not experience recruitment\ndifficulties. Organisations that had experienced recruitment difficulties were\nsignificantly more likely to use commercial websites (p<0.05) but not to use\ncorporate websites. There was no difference in the success of either\ncommercial jobs boards or corporate websites in those companies that did or\ndid not experience recruitment difficulties.\nIn order to examine the relative importance of the above factors of industry\nsector, industry, organisation size and experience of recruitment difficulties on\n21\nthe use and perceived success of corporate websites and commercial jobs\nboards, a series of logistic regressions were performed. Industry sector,\nconsisting of three values (private, public and not for profit), was entered into\nthe analysis as two dummy variables with not for profit as the reference value.\nTake in Table 4\nThe model produced a Chi-square value of 24.97 (p<0.01) and a Nagelkerke\nR squared value of 0.045.\nThe logistic regression analysis depicted in table 4 showed that use of\ncommercial jobs boards was significantly related to organisation size, sector\n(specifically whether or not an organisation was private sector), industry and\nrecruitment difficulties, with these variables explaining just under five percent\nof the variance in the criterion variable. Larger organisations, services\norganisations and those with recruitment difficulties were significantly more\nlikely to use commercial jobs boards. Private sector organisations were\nsignificantly less likely to use commercial jobs boards. These findings support\nthe chi-square comparisons above.\nTake in Table 5\nThe model produced a Chi-square value of 31.75 (p<0.01) and a Nagelkerke\nR squared value of 0.054.\nThe analysis in table 5 showed that use of a corporate website was\nsignificantly related to organisation size and sector (specifically whether or not\n22\nan organisation was private sector), with these variables explaining just over\nfive percent of the variance in the criterion variable. Larger organisations\nwere significantly more likely to use their corporate website for recruitment,\nwhile private sector organisations were significantly less likely to use their\ncorporate website for recruitement.\nTake in Table 6\nThe model shown in table 6 produced a Chi-square value of 5.03, which was\nnot significant.\nThe logistic regression analysis in table 6 showed that the criterion of\nperceived success of commercial jobs boards could not be predicted using\nthe predictors of organisation size, sector, industry and recruitment difficulties.\nTake in Table 7\nThe model produced a Chi-square value of 9.25, which was not significant.\nWhile the logistic regression model in table 7 was not significant, the predictor\nof organisation size was shown to have a significant effect on the criterion of\nperceived success of corporate websites, in that larger organisations were\nmore likely to find this method successful. The perceived success of\ncorporate websites could not be predicted using sector, industry and\nrecruitment difficulties.\n23\nAre there steps that employers can take to improve their success at\nusing online recruitment methods?\nInterviewees were asked to discuss whether there was anything that they felt\nthat they had done that had impacted on the success or otherwise of their use\nof online recruitment. The analysis of this information produced a number of\nkey themes.\nDriving traffic to a corporate website\nThe interviews provided some evidence that those companies that use their\ncorporate website successfully for recruitment, are those that either have a\nprominent brand as an employer or take steps to drive job seekers to their\nwebsite. It was clear that corporate websites cannot successfully be used to\nrecruit employees in organisations that are not already very well known unless\na company adopts other advertising channels such as jobs boards or print\nmedia to drive people to the site. For instance, one interviewee from a small\ncharity had experienced difficulties using their corporate website as job\nseekers rarely looked at the site. Another interviewee commented that he\nwas \u201cnot sure how successful we would be if we only used online methods as\nnobody would look at our website\u201d. Commonly, jobs boards were used to\ndrive traffic to a company\u2019s corporate website through the use of a web link.\n24\nUse of back-office functionality\nA number of organisations had also taken steps to overcome the resource\nintensiveness of online recruitment by adopting additional functionality.\nAdvances in Internet technology have meant that a system can be designed\nthat posts an advertisement to several jobs boards simultaneously,\nacknowledges applications and forwards them to line managers automatically\nand performs a number of initial screening activities. This removes some of\nthe administrative burden from the HR function and makes the process less\nresource intensive. In fact the use of a back-office system for managing the\nrecruitment process had led to significant efficiency savings in some\norganisations. One interviewee claimed that it had improved the efficiency of\nthe recruitment processes in his organisation by 60 percent.\nCreation of a talent pool\nAn additional benefit identified was that data about candidates could be\ncaptured automatically (rather than needing to be keyed into the system).\nInformation about candidates could then be kept by the organisation as a kind\nof \u2018talent pool\u2019 and searched at a later date should another vacancy arise\nMany of the companies who had found success in using online recruitment\nmethods had used the Internet in this way, to become more than just an\nadvertising point\nBranding and the provision of information to candidates\nSuccessful organisations have also minimised the number of unsuitable\napplications by taking advantage of the ability to include vast amounts of\n25\ninformation in different formats on their corporate recruitment websites.\nPotential employees can therefore learn more about the company and job role\nby reading text, watching videos and listening to audio files. This allows\ncandidates to self-select as to whether they are suitable for any particular role.\nOne of the interview respondents had even included a short self-selection test\nthat was scored automatically in order to advise respondents whether or not\nthey should apply for a particular role. As already noted, the use of Internet\ntechnology also allows a company to promote their employer brand. Those\ncompanies interviewed who had used the method successfully believed they\nhad created attractive advertisements or web pages which were in\naccordance with the company brand.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThis paper examines survey data on the use and perceived success of\nInternet recruitment over a six-year period within the UK. The paper is also\nbased on interview data which explored the factors that may affect success\nfor an employer when using these methods. More specifically, we have\nexplored whether particular types of organisation are more successful at using\nonline recruitment methods and whether there are steps that employers can\ntake to improve their success at using online methods.\nThe results showed that less than a third of the organisations surveyed used\ncorporate websites and only a quarter used commercial websites in June\n2006. While Internet recruitment was used therefore by a significant\nproportion of the recruiting population, these results do not reflect the\n26\nphenomenal rise in the use of internet recruitment that was predicted by the\nmedia in the mid-1990s. In addition, our results did not show a large\nincrease in the number of organisations using corporate or commercial\nwebsites over the past four years. However, given that online recruitment\nwas first introduced around 1995, it is presumed that the growth in the use of\nthese methods was greater prior to 2000. Interestingly, however, almost half\nof the organisations surveyed expected to increase their use of both corporate\nand commercial websites during the next year, suggesting a longer-term trend\ntowards the expansion of Internet recruitment in the future. This suggests that\nthey are seeing online recruitment as being a successful method in the future,\nthereby creating an upward trend in its overall use. However, many current\nnon-users of online recruitment do not appear to be converting to the method,\nmeaning that the number of organisations using it grows more slowly.\nOf those organisations that did use either online recruitment method, just\nunder three quarters found the method successful. Only 40% of current\nInternet recruitment users and about a fifth of non-Internet recruitment users\nexpected to reduce their use of other recruitment methods due to their use of\nInternet recruitment. Most organisations recognise its benefits with regard to\ncost, ease of use and access to candidates, therefore supporting the previous\nresearch into this aspect (Starcke, 1996; Cappelli, 2001; CIPD, 2006). Our\nresults however, also confirm the existence of some of the limitations of\ncommercial websites (Starcke, 1996) in that a large proportion of responding\norganisations had experienced problems with applications from unsuitable\ncandidates. The mixed success that organisations experience in using online\n27\nrecruitment may be one reason behind the failure of Internet recruitment to\ndominate the recruitment marketplace as predicted. Clearly there are\ncurrently inhibitions to the spread of Internet recruitment. There is also a\nstrong probability that labour market constraints dencourage employers to\ncontinue with existing traditional methods, whilst also turning to use the\nInternet in addition.\nAs well as investigating general trends in the use and perceived success of\ncorporate and commercial websites, this paper also explored whether the\nsuccess of online recruitment was influenced firstly by the type of organisation\nusing the method, and secondly by the way in which the organisation uses the\nmethod. There was a perception among corporate users of online\nrecruitment in particular that online methods were not as appropriate for use\nin smaller organisations, for blue collar, lower level roles and for very senior\nroles. This was denied by the providers of online recruitment services that\nwere interviewed.\nThe fact that the use of online recruitment remains more prevalent in larger\norganisations and in the services sector suggests that the perception that the\nInternet is more suitable for particular types of roles or organisations is\ncommonplace and may be affecting the adoption of these methods. Similarly,\nlarger and public sector organisations may be more likely to fill a large number\nof vacancies and this means that they can cope with a large candidate pool.\nHowever, our survey results suggested that the successful use of commercial\njobs boards was not related to industry, sector or organisation size and the\n28\nperceived success of corporate websites was related only to organisation\nsize. These findings strongly refute the suggestion that online recruitment can\nonly be successful for some organisations and is therefore an important\nfinding of this research. It may be that any organisation can find success with\nonline methods if they adopt an appropriate strategy for their use and\nimplementation. Indeed, with Internet penetration now at an all time high in\nthe UK (66% of the adult UK population; IAB, 2006) there appears to be no\nreason why all organisations should not use this method.\nWhether the Internet could replace other recruitment channels is less clear.\nAt this point in time, it appears that, while organisations are using online\nrecruitment, they are not prepared to discard the more traditional methods\nsuch as print media and employment agencies. There is certainly a need to\nuse these methods to drive job seekers to a corporate site in those\norganisations with a less developed brand. It is perhaps too early however to\ndraw conclusions about the future growth of online recruitment and the\ncorresponding change in the resourcing process. The interview data\nsuggests that the functionality of online recruitment sites can be improved in a\nway that will overcome their limitations and therefore make the internet more\nsuccessful at recruiting across all sectors, occupations and at all levels. If\norganisations can use online recruitment successfully in this way, then these\nmethods may eventually dominate the recruitment market. Indeed, the survey\nresults have shown that our respondents believed the impact on other\nmethods is expected to increase in the future. For the near future though, it\n29\nseems that the Internet will commonly be used in conjunction with other\nmethods.\nThe interviews suggested a number of ways in which organisations can\nimprove their chances of being successful in using online recruitment\nmethods. The need to drive traffic to a corporate site, the use of back-office\nfunctionality such as applicant management and sifting technology, the\ncreation of a talent pool and the need to use appropriate branding and\ninformation was discussed. There are useful lessons in this data therefore\nfor practitioners introducing online recruitment.\nThe purpose of this paper was not to examine the use of online testing or\napplicant management systems, but it appears, based on the information from\nthese interviews that the ability to use online recruitment methods\nsuccessfully may be related more to the extent and understanding of\nfunctionality and support than to the nature of the organisation itself. It may\nbe that the shift from traditional to online methods is not as simple as just\nswapping recruitment channels. The use of online recruitment may require a\nchange in the wider recruitment process rather than just the advertising\nmedium. If an organisation simply transfers traditional recruitment advertising\nmethods online then they may encounter difficulties with the volume of\napplicants as discussed above. Indeed, the benefits of online recruitment may\nonly be realised if the organisation\u2019s approach to the way that they recruit is\nfundamentally adjusted. The use of online tools for sifting and the use of high\nvalidity selection tools early in the recruitment process, in conjunction with\n30\napplicant management systems, may allow an organisation to cope effectively\nwith the increased volume of applicants that may result from the move online.\nResearch from AGR (2007) suggested that many employers are now moving\nin this direction with 77% of respondents to their survey only accepting online\napplications. This may however be a characteristic of graduate recruitment\ncompared to the more general recruitment studied in our research. Future\nresearch to compare those organisations that have adopted the above\napproach and those that have simply moved traditional approaches online\nwould provide more insight into this area. In the meantime, the implications\nfor practitioners are clear. They must pay attention to the effective\ndevelopment and implementation of online methods to drive traffic to\ncorporate websites, invest in systems which sift and manage applicants and\nsee how they can promote their employer brand, if they are to find success\nusing online recruitment.\nThe above research is not without its limitations. We have conducted survey\nresearch using single respondents from each organisation who are\nresponsible for recruitment but have enriched this data through the use of\nlongitudinal data and qualitative interviews. Our research has therefore\nprovided a vital first step in empirically exploring the usage and perceived\nsuccess of online recruitment within the UK and has suggested that the\nsuccessful use of online recruitment channels may be more complex than\ninitially predicted. Further research is needed in order to empirically test the\ntheories explored above in more detail and with a larger sample of online\nrecruitment users. Our study, as the first empirical analysis of the\n31\ndevelopment of online recruitment in the UK, provides a sound basis for this\nresearch and some important insights into the use and potential success of\nonline recruitment methods. In addition, the results of our study provide some\ndirection for practitioners when considering the adoption of online recruitment\nand therefore provide an important step towards a more thorough\nunderstanding of the successful use of online recruitment within the UK.\nReferences\nArthur, D.
