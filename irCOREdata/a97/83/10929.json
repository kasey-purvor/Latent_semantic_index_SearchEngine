Introduction\n[2] Auroral omega bands were first reported as a distinct\nclass of auroral structure by Akasofu and Kimball [1964].\nOriginally, the name referred to the distinct, undulating\nshape of the auroral arc, which resembled an inverted Greek\nletter W. However, over nearly 50 years of usage, the clas-\nsification has gradually evolved. For example, whereas\nAkasofu and Kimball\u2019s omega bands were distorted arcs,\nLyons and Walterscheid [1985] presented observations of\nomega bands with a dark, inverted W shape formed by bright\ntorches extending poleward from the auroral oval, and\nOpgenoorth et al. [1994] reported \u201cstreets\u201d of multiple\nomega band structures in which undulations on the pole-\nward boundary gave rise to alternating bright humps and\ndark bays. L\u00fchr and Schlegel [1994] described omega bands\nas \u201ca luminous band from which tongue\u2010like protrusions\nextend toward the north\u201d with the bright tongues shaped like\na Greek W and the dark area separating adjacent tongues\nshaped like an inverted W. In recent research, the term\nomega band has been used to described all of the above\n1Physics Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n2Department of Physics andAstronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary,\nAlberta, Canada.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n4Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London,\nHolmbury St. Mary, UK.\n5Department of Physics, Imperial College London, London, UK.\n6Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Uppsala, Sweden.\n7National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo, Japan.\n8Department of Information and Communication Engineering,\nUniversity of Electro\u2010Communications, Tokyo, Japan.\n9Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, USA.\n10Institut f\u00fcr Geophysik und Extraterrestrische Physik, Technische\nUniversit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.\n11ESS, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, California, USA.\n12Science Institute, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JA015874\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, A00I30, doi:10.1029\/2010JA015874, 2011\nA00I30 1 of 20\nvariants on what is assumed to be the same basic auroral\nstructure [Syrj\u00e4suo and Donovan, 2004; Safargaleev et al.,\n2005; Vanham\u00e4ki et al., 2009].\n[3] Regardless of the exact auroral configuration, omega\nbands exhibit many common properties. Omega bands and\nmagnetic pulsations in the Ps6 wave band (4\u201340 min peri-\nodicity) are usually observed simultaneously [Kawasaki and\nRostoker, 1979; Andr\u00e9 and Baumjohann, 1982], with\nmagnetic disturbances interpreted as evidence of the passage\nof field\u2010aligned currents within the auroral structures [L\u00fchr\nand Schlegel, 1994; Wild et al., 2000]. Omega bands, typ-\nically 400\u20131000 km in size, are usually observed propa-\ngating eastward (i.e., dawnward) at speeds of 0.4\u20132 km s\u22121\nin the morning sector auroral zone and are generally asso-\nciated with the recovery phase of magnetospheric substorms\n[e.g., Vanham\u00e4ki et al., 2009, and references therein].\n[4] While the distribution of quasi\u2010stationary, field\u2010\naligned currents within omega bands is broadly understood\n[L\u00fchr and Schlegel, 1994; Wild et al., 2000; Amm et al.,\n2005; Kavanagh et al., 2009], the mechanism responsible\nfor omega band formation remains unclear. The reader is\ndirected to Amm et al. [2005] for a useful review of the\nvarious models proposed to explain omega band generation.\nThese models include energetic particle precipitation in the\nmorning sector originating from the outer edge of the ring\ncurrent region [Opgenoorth et al., 1994], an electrostatic\ninterchange instability developing at the poleward (tailward)\nedge of a torus of hot plasma in the near\u2010Earth magneto-\nsphere during the substorm recovery phase [Yamamoto\net al., 1997], and the structuring of magnetic vorticity and\nfield\u2010aligned currents via the Kelvin\u2010Helmholtz instability\n[Janhunen and Huuskonen, 1993].\n[5] In this paper, we present space\u2010 and ground\u2010based\nmeasurements of omega bands observed during the night of\n27\u201328 September 2009. The omega bands studied are\nslightly unusual in that they were observed in the midnight\n(21\u201303 MLT) sector ionosphere, rather than the morning\n(03\u201309 MLT) sector, and occurred shortly after a substorm\nexpansion phase onset\/intensification (rather than during a\nsubstorm recovery phase). Our investigation of these\nsomewhat atypical omega bands reveals that unlike previ-\nously reported examples, they are relatively small and slow\nmoving. Although in situ field and plasma measurements\nfrom the conjugate region of the magnetosphere indicated\nenhanced but variable Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting flux and bursts of\nfield\u2010parallel moving electrons, a clear one\u2010to\u2010one corre-\nspondence with individual omega bands was not observed.\nIn the this paper, we first introduce the experimental\ninstrumentation used in our study, then present the\nupstream, ground\u2010 and space\u2010based observations before\ndiscussing and summarizing our findings.\n2. Instrumentation\n[6] Figure 1 shows the disposition of spacecraft used in\nthis study. Upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) conditions were provided by a single probe of the\nNASA Time\u2010History of Events and Macroscale Interactions\nduring Substorms (THEMIS) mission [Angelopoulos, 2008];\nmagnetospheric plasma and magnetic field measurements\ncame from the four satellites of the ESA Cluster mission\n[Escoubet et al., 1997, 2001]. Figure 1 shows the location\nof these spacecraft at 0000 UT on 28 September 2009 in\nthe X\u2010Z and X\u2010Y GSM planes, with the position of\neach indicated by the labeled symbols. Also indicated for\nreference are magnetic field lines derived from the\nTsyganenko 2001 model [Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b],\nhereafter referred to as the T01 model, and a model mag-\nnetopause [after Shue et al. 1997]. The solar wind and IMF\nparameterization of these models is discussed further in\nsection 3. The present study exploits ion plasma data from\nthe electrostatic analyzer (ESA [McFadden et al., 2008a,\n2008b]) and magnetic field data from the fluxgate magne-\ntometer (FGM [Auster et al., 2008]) on the THEMIS C\nprobe in order to monitor the solar wind and IMF, respec-\ntively. During the interval of interest, THEMIS C (indicated\nby the black square in Figure 1) was located in the solar\nwind \u223c22 RE upstream of the Earth, approximately in the\nEarth\u2019s orbital plane but offset from the Sun\u2010Earth line by\n\u223c4 RE in the dawnward direction.\n[7] At 0000 UT on 28 September 2009, the four Cluster\nsatellites were moving tailward and southward toward\napogee in the postmidnight sector magnetosphere. Clusters\n1, 3 and 4 (indicated by the black, green and blue circles,\nrespectively) were located in the northern tail lobe between\n6 and 8 RE downtail of the Earth at \u223c0130 magnetic local\ntime (MLT). Cluster 2 (indicated by the red circle) was\nsomewhat farther downtail at a radial distance \u223c9 RE and a\nslightly earlier magnetic local time of \u223c0040 MLT. In this\nstudy we exploit magnetic field measurements made by the\nFigure 1. Locations of the THEMIS and Cluster spacecraft\nused in this study at 0000 UT on 28 September 2009, pro-\njected into the GSM (top) X\u2010Z and (bottom) X\u2010Y planes.\nMagnetic field lines derived from the T01 magnetospheric\nfield model and the modeled magnetopause location are also\nshown, as described in the text.\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n2 of 20\nCluster fluxgate magnetometer experiment (FGM [Balogh\net al., 1997, 2001]), electron plasma observations made by\nthe Cluster plasma electron and current experiment (PEACE\n[Johnstone et al., 1997; Owen et al., 2001]) and electric\nfield measurements from the electric fields and waves\ninstrument (EFW [Gustafsson et al., 1997, 2001]).\n[8] Ground\u2010based auroral observations were provided by\na new all\u2010sky imager (ASI) located on the Tj\u00f6rnes pen-\ninsula in northeastern Iceland (66.2\u00b0N, 17.1\u00b0W, geographic\ncoordinates). This color \u201cRainbow\u201d imager [Partamies et al.,\n2007] is similar in both design and operation to those of the\nTHEMIS ground\u2010based observatory (GBO) array; the main\ndifference is the use of a color CCD imager to provide color\nall\u2010sky images (THEMIS GBOs produce only gray scale\nimages). Images are automatically recorded at a rate of\n10 frames per minute during hours of darkness, yielding a\n6 s cadence. Two additional imagers deployed at \u00feykkvib\u00e6r\n(southwestern Iceland) and T\u00f3rshavn (Faroe Isles) were not\nused in this study due to unfavorable weather conditions at\nthose sites during the period of interest.\n[9] Observations of ionospheric flow were derived from\nthe Iceland East radar of the Super Dual Auroral Radar\nNetwork (SuperDARN [Chisham et al., 2007]). This\ncoherent scatter, high\u2010frequency radar, located at \u00feykkvib\u00e6r\nin southwestern Iceland, one half of the Co\u2010operative\nUK Twin\u2010Located Auroral Sounding System radar pair\n(CUTLASS [Lester et al., 2004]), has a field of view (FOV)\nthat extends northeastward, covering an area over 3 \u00d7\n106 km2. In standard operations the FOV comprises 16 dis-\ncrete beams separated by 3.24\u00b0 in azimuth, with each beam\nsubdivided into 75 individual range bins 45 km in length.\nLike all SuperDARN radars, the Iceland East radar is a fre-\nquency agile system (8\u201320 MHz) that routinely measures the\nline\u2010of\u2010sight (LOS) Doppler velocity and spectral width of,\nand the backscattered power from, ionospheric plasma\nirregularities. However, this particular radar has been\nequipped with a so\u2010called \u201cstereo\u201d capability, enabling two\nbeams to be sounded simultaneously by interleaving two\ntransmitted pulse sequences at slightly offset frequency\nchannels. During the interval of interest, the stereo capability\nwas deployed to sound the full FOV (i.e., scanning through\nbeams 0, 1, 2, 3..15 in sequence) using channel A while\nsounding only one beam direction (beam 5) using channel B.\nGiven a 3 s dwell time on each beam (and allowing for radar\nintegration and minute timing synchronization with other\nSuperDARN radars), this mode returned a full scan of the\ncomplete FOV every minute (via channel A) and measure-\nments along the high\u2010resolution beam every 3 s (via channel\nB). In this study, we shall focus on measurements from the\nhigh time resolution channel (B).\n[10] Finally, to reveal the magnetic perturbations associ-\nated with auroral features observed by the above experiments,\nwe exploit 1 s resolution ground magnetic field measure-\nments from a fluxgate magnetometer colocated with the\nTj\u00f6rnes Rainbow ASI and deployed by the Japanese National\nInstitute of Polar Research (NIPR) [Sato and Saemundsson,\n1984].\n[11] Figure 2 shows the distribution of the instruments\nemployed in this study. The FOV of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI is\nindicated by the shaded dark gray circle. Specifically, this\ncorresponds to the FOV projected to 110 km altitude and for\nlook directions within 80\u00b0 of the zenith (disregarding the\nportion of the FOV within 10\u00b0 of the horizon where line\u2010of\u2010\nsight projection gives rise to the greatest uncertainties). The\nfull FOV of the Iceland East SuperDARN radar (sounded\nby channel A) is shown by the light gray shaded region,\nwith the high time resolution beam (beam 5, sounded by\nchannel B) outlined by the gray dotted lines. The locations\nFigure 2. The arrangement of ground\u2010based experiments employed in this study. Coastlines are pro-\njected in a polar geographic coordinate system, with parallels of constant geomagnetic latitude overlaid\nat 80\u00b0, 70\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and geomagnetic meridians overlaid at 15\u00b0 intervals (dotted lines). The\nlight and dark gray shaded areas show the fields of view of the SuperDARN Iceland East and Tj\u00f6rnes\nRainbow ASI, respectively. The locations of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI (labeled TJRN) and the Iceland East radar\nsite at \u00feykkvib\u00e6r (labeled \u00feYKK) are also indicated. Colored arcs show the magnetic footprints at 110 km\naltitude of the four Cluster satellites, color\u2010coded as in Figure 1 (black, C1; red, C2; green, C3; blue, C4)\nwith solid circular tick marks indicating each satellite\u2019s position at hourly intervals (note that the 0100 UT\ntick mark labels for C3 and C4 are omitted for clarity).\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n3 of 20\nof the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI\/magnetometer and \u00feykkvib\u00e6r radar\nsites are indicated by crossed circles labeled \u201cTJRN\u201d and\n\u201c\u00feYKK\u201d, respectively.\n[12] For reference, the magnetic footprints of the Cluster\nsatellites during the interval from 2200 UT (on 27 Sep-\ntember) to 0200 UT (on 28 September) are superimposed on\nFigure 2. Each satellite\u2019s footprint, computed at an altitude\nof 110 km using the T01 magnetic field model, is color\u2010\ncoded as in Figure 1 with locations indicated at hourly in-\ntervals. The T01 model was selected because it has been\noptimized to represent the inner and near magnetosphere\nregion (XGSM \u2265 \u221215 RE) for different interplanetary condi-\ntions and ground disturbance levels [Tsyganenko, 2002a,\n2002b]. To generate the footprint for each satellite, location\ninformation is extracted from the Cluster FGM data set at a\ntemporal resolution of 1 s. The most recent upstream (PSW,\nIMF BY, IMF BZ observed by THEMIS C) and geomagnetic\n(Dst) data are then selected as inputs to calculate the foot-\nprint positions at a 1 s resolution.\n3. Observations\n3.1. Interplanetary Conditions\n[13] Figure 3 presents an overview of upstream inter-\nplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind conditions\nfor the 4 h interval spanning midnight on 28 September.\nThese measurements, recorded by the THEMIS C probe, are\nimportant in two key respects. First, they indicate the likely\nenergy and momentum input to the magnetosphere during\nthe interval in question. Second, these upstream observa-\ntions parameterize the T01 magnetic field model used to\nestimate the magnetic footprints of the Cluster satellites (as\nshown in Figures 1 and 2). Of particular relevance are the\nsolar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field en-\ngulfing the dayside magnetosphere. As such, the data pre-\nsented in Figure 3 are time shifted (or lagged) to account for\nthe Earthward propagation from the point of measurement to\nthe dayside magnetopause. For this study, based upon the\nprobe\u2019s location (\u223c12 RE upstream of the magnetopause)\nand the observed solar wind plasma velocity, upstream\nparameters from THEMIS C are lagged by +3 min in order\nto present the solar wind and IMF conditions impinging\nupon the dayside magnetopause.\n[14] The BZ component of the IMF was directed southward\nalmost continuously throughout this interval (with a brief\nnorthward excursion at 0030 UT) while the IMF BY com-\nponent was positive (duskward). Given the generally similar\nmagnitudes of both components, this resulted in an IMF\nclock angle (defined as arctan(BY \/BZ)) of \u223c135\u00b0 throughout\nthe interval. The BX component was positive throughout\n(except for a brief negative excursion at \u223c2220 UT), indi-\ncating that IMF phase fronts were tilted toward the Earth and\nthe overall interplanetary magnetic field magnitude remained\nbetween 2.0 and 3.5 nT. The antisunward ion velocity typ-\nically \u223c325 km s\u22121 declined sightly over the 4 h interval,\nwhile the ion density increased gradually from 12 to 15 cm\u22123.\nAs a result, the solar wind pressure varied between 2 and\n3 nPa.\n3.2. Auroral and Ground\u2010Based Measurements\n[15] Figure 4 presents an overview of the ground\u2010based\nmeasurements used in this study. Figure 4a shows iono-\nspheric LOS Doppler velocity measured along the high time\nresolution beam (beam 5) of the SuperDARN Iceland East\nradar, plotted as a function of universal time and magnetic\nlatitude. Velocity measurements are color\u2010coded according\nto the color bar on the right side, with positive (green\/blue)\nvelocities directed toward the radar and negative (yellow\/\nred) velocities directed away from it. The magnetic latitude\nof the ASI zenith is indicated by a dashed horizontal line.\nGiven the orientation of the radar FOV (as indicated in\nFigure 2), beam 5 does not exactly overlook the Tj\u00f6rnes\nRainbow ASI site. Relative to the ASI zenith, beam 5\ncrosses the ASI magnetic latitude \u223c50 km westward of the\nsite and crosses the ASI magnetic meridian \u223c50 km north-\nward of it. Throughout the interval, backscatter was\nobserved at various ranges, but after \u223c2330 UT, a persistent\nband of backscatter was observed between 66.5\u00b0 and 67.5\u00b0\n(highlighted by the dotted horizontal lines). Figure 4b pre-\nsents a time series of LOS velocity, averaged over range\ngates between these latitudes. The vertical axis has been\nreversed such that negative velocities (corresponding to\npoleward motion) are represented by values increasing\ntoward the top of the page.\n[16] Figure 4c is a keogram derived from the magnetic\nmeridian of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI. For clarity, these data have been\npresented in an inverted gray scale such that areas of dark\nshading correspond to bright auroral emission. Brightness is\npresented in a system of arbitrary units because the Rainbow\nASI system does not yield calibrated brightness measure-\nments. The magnetic latitude of the ASI\u2019s zenith and the\nupper\/lower boundaries over which SuperDARN iono-\nspheric radar velocities are averaged are overlaid onto the\nkeogram as dashed and dotted horizontal lines, respectively.\nIt should be noted that at the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI site, magnetic local\ntime is approximately the same as local time (MLT = UT +\n14 min) such that the universal time annotation on the hori-\nzontal axis is a reasonable approximation to the magnetic\nlocal time of themeridional observations. Italicized numerals\/\nletters indicate features discussed below.\n[17] Figures 4d\u20134g show magnetic field data from the\nNIPR fluxgate magnetometer located at Tj\u00f6rnes (i.e., colo-\ncated with the Rainbow ASI). Figure 4d presents unfiltered\n\u201craw\u201d magnetometer data with the H component (black\ntrace and left scale) directed toward magnetic north and the\nD component (red trace and right scale) directed orthogo-\nnally eastward within the horizontal plane. Figures 4e and 4f\npresent the same magnetometer data, but band\u2010pass filtered\nto reveal fluctuations in the Ps6 pulsation range (with per-\niods between 4 and 40 min) and the Pi2 pulsation range\n(with periods between 40 and 150 s), respectively. To study\nthe current structures that underlie these magnetic fluctua-\ntions, it is necessary to derive a sequence of equivalent\ncurrent vectors. For an E region current system with a spatial\nextent greater than the E region height, and assuming a\nhorizontally uniform ionospheric conductivity, the ground\nmagnetic field deflections, b, can be related to an iono-\nspheric equivalent current density, J, by\nJH \u00bc \u0002 2\n\u00010\nbD and JD \u00bc 2\n\u00010\nbH\nwhere the H and D subscripts indicate the geomagnetic\nnorthward and eastward components, respectively [L\u00fchr\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n4 of 20\nFigure 3.

Figure 4g therefore presents equivalent\ncurrent vectors derived from Tj\u00f6rnes magnetometer data,\npreprocessed by bandpass filtering to retain Ps6 pulsations\n(as in Figure 4e). Equivalent current vectors pointing ver-\ntically (horizontally) on the page correspond to northward\n(eastward) currents, and an eastward 0.1 A m\u22121 equivalent\ncurrent vector is shown for scale. For context, Figures 4h\nand 4i show time series of the auroral electrojet (AE)\nFigure 4\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n6 of 20\nindex (Figure 4h) and both the provisional AU and AL\nindices from which it is derived (Figure 4i) to indicate\nglobal electrojet activity in the auroral zone.\n[18] The observations presented in Figure 4 give an\noverview of the temporal evolution of the auroral features.\nBefore describing these in more detail, it is worthwhile to\nintroduce the spatial evolution of the auroral structures\nunder scrutiny. In Figure 5, we present a summary of\nthe auroral omega bands observed just after midnight on\n28 September 2009. Specifically, Figure 5 shows auroral\nASI data projected onto a magnetic latitude\/magnetic local\ntime coordinate system at 110 km altitude as if viewed from\nabove. Figures 5a\u20135l show selected color auroral images as\nrecorded by the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI between 2334:00 UT and\n0051:18 UT with the estimated footprints of the Cluster\nsatellites also indicated. In order to aid comparisons between\nthe time series and spatial data (Figures 4 and 5, respec-\ntively), key features are commonly labeled. For example,\nthe specific timings of the 12 all\u2010sky images shown in\nFigures 5a\u2013l are labeled a\u2013l in the ASI keogram presented in\nFigure 4c. Also indicated is the train of auroral omega\nbands, labeled i\u2013v in Figures 4 and 5. The timing of events\nintroduced in the discussion session, such as key stages of\nthe observed substorm dynamics and the times at which the\nfour Cluster satellites cross the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI keogram\nmeridian, are also indicated at the top of Figure 4.\n[19] At the start of the interval presented in Figure 4\n(23 UT on 27 September 2009), the ground\u2010based ob-\nservations suggest low geomagnetic activity. The AE index\nwas steady at \u223c100 nT and the Tj\u00f6rnes ground magnetom-\neter observed a relatively undisturbed magnetic field. At this\ntime, the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI observed only very faint auroral\nactivity characterized by faint, patchy, and diffuse emission\npoleward of the zenith and a faint east\u2010west aligned arc\nslightly equatorward of the zenith. This arc (just visible in\nthe keogram presented in Figure 4) had been present for\nthe preceding hour following earlier substorm activity at\n2200 UT. Throughout the first \u223c45 min of this interval, the\nIceland East SuperDARN radar observed limited and spo-\nradic ionospheric backscatter in the vicinity of the ASI FOV,\ncharacterized by persistent bursts of equatorward\/westward\n(positive, color\u2010coded blue) flow poleward of 69\u00b0 magnetic\nlatitude that were not associated with auroral emissions.\nEquatorward of 68\u00b0 magnetic latitude, patchy regions of\npoleward\/eastward (negative, color\u2010coded red) flow were\nobserved. Given the relatively short range (\u223c250 km) at\nwhich the SuperDARN Iceland East radar was sounding the\nauroral oval, it is likely that the radar pulses were being\nbackscattered by E (rather than F) region ionospheric plasma\nirregularities.\n[20] As shown in Figure 3, the IMF was directed south-\nward and duskward throughout this interval. In fact,\ninspection of a longer time series of upstream data indicates\nthat the IMF BZ component had been southward almost\ncontinuously for the preceding 10 h. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the faint arc observed equatorward of the\nTj\u00f6rnes ASI zenith was observed to drift slowly equator-\nward, consistent with expected motion during the growth\nphase of a magnetospheric substorm. Inspection of indi-\nvidual ASI images reveals that at 2333:36 UT the faint east\u2010\nwest aligned arc brightens at the western (duskward) edge of\nthe imager\u2019s FOV. This brightening was accompanied by a\nbrief magnetic pulsation in the Pi2 band and was followed by\nbrightening of the entire arc over the next minute (Figure 5a).\nIn the following \u223c3 min a second, faint, arc developed just\npoleward of the existing arc in the western half of the FOV,\nextending to just eastward of the zenith (clearly visible in the\nkeogram). However, no significant magnetic disturbances\nwere observed at the Tj\u00f6rnes station and the global geo-\nmagnetic indices do not indicate significant geomagnetic\nactivity at this time.\n[21] A further, sustained, burst of Pi2 pulsations was\nobserved at 2340:00 UT and over the next \u223c5 min, the faint\npoleward arc brightened and moved poleward. This was\naccompanied by the onset of a steady decline in the H\ncomponent magnetic field recorded at Tj\u00f6rnes and an\nenhancement of the AE index (due to a sharp decrease in the\nvalue of the AL index). At 2344:30 UT, a few minutes after\nthe Pi2 pulsations began, the poleward arc brightened sig-\nnificantly (Figure 5b). As the arc brightened, a sudden\nincrease in the amount of E region ionospheric backscatter\nwas observed in the region of the ASI zenith by the Iceland\nEast radar, with the flow directed strongly (>200 m s\u22121)\naway from the radar (poleward and eastward) for the next\n5 min.\n[22] After remaining steady for \u223c13 min after 2344:30 UT,\nthe poleward arc brightened dramatically and expanded,\nstarting at 2357:12 UT (Figures 5c and 5d). This intensifi-\ncation in auroral emissions was accompanied by a (colocated)\nsharp increase in the northward and eastward ionospheric\nvelocity observed in Beam 5 of the Iceland East radar, a\nfurther intensification in Pi2 pulsation amplitude and sharp\ndisturbances in the H and D components of the ground\nmagnetic observed at Tj\u00f6rnes. The auroral breakup and\npoleward expansion continued over the following minutes\n(Figure 5e).\n[23] During the next \u223c45 min a series of undulations or\ntorches were observed propagating eastward through the\nASI field of view. Five examples (numbered i\u2013v), indicated\nin the keogram presented in Figure 4, correspond to omega\u2010\nFigure 4. An overview of ground\u2010based data used in this study.

Although the\nphasing of H and D component fluctuations varied, after\n\u223c0030 UT, the two components were approximately 180\u00b0\nout of phase. When plotted as ionospheric equivalent current\nvectors, these fluctuations manifest as clockwise rotations in\nthe equivalent current direction. At \u223c0100 UT, following the\npeak in the AE index (due to a minimum in the AL index),\nauroral emissions underwent another sudden poleward\nexpansion. For the next \u223c45 min, multiple pulsating arclets\nfilled the ASI field of view.\n3.3. Magnetospheric Observations\n[25] As indicated in Figure 5, the Cluster quartet entered\nthe Tj\u00f6rnes ASI field of view from the eastern horizon\n(moving east to west) when the torch\u2010like auroral features\nwere moving west to east over the ASI. We will therefore\nexamine in situ field and particle measurements from the\nsatellites as they transit the Earth\u2019s magnetic tail.\n[26] Figure 6 presents field and particle measurements\nfrom Cluster 3 between 2300 and 0200 UT. At this stage,\nwe present detailed data from one satellite only, as the\nmeasurements are similar across the Cluster quartet. Multi-\nsatellite measurements are presented in section 4. Figure 6\n(first to third panels) show standard energy\u2010time spectro-\nFigure 5. All\u2010sky images recorded by the Tj\u00f6rnes Rainbow imager during the passage of auroral omega\nbands. The images are projected onto a magnetic latitude\/magnetic local time grid at an altitude of 110 km.\n(a) The dotted vertical line corresponds to the 0000 MLT meridian, with other MLT meridians indicated at\n1 h intervals. In Figures 5b\u20135l, the ASI remains at the center, and these grid lines move owing to the\nadvancing universal time. The curved dotted lines indicate the 70\u00b0N and 60\u00b0N parallels of magnetic lat-\nitude. Projected at an emission altitude of 110 km, the edge of the circular field of view (10\u00b0 above the\nlocal horizon at the ASI site) corresponds to a ground range of approximately 500 km from the ASI.\nThe magnetic footprints at 110 km of the four Cluster satellites are also overlaid, color\u2010coded as in\nFigure 2.

These spectra include data from both the high\u2010 and\nlow\u2010energy electron analyzers that constitute the PEACE\ninstrument (HEEA and LEEA, respectively) and have tem-\nporal resolution equal to the satellite\u2019s spin period (\u223c4 s).\n[27] Figure 6 (fourth to seventh panels) present corre-\nsponding magnetic field measurements from the Cluster 3\nFGM experiment. Although these three\u2010component data are\nanalyzed at a resolution of 5 vectors per second, they have\nbeen smoothed by application of a running average window\nof length equivalent to the satellite spin period to remove\nhigh\u2010frequency fluctuations. Figure 6 shows the BX, BY and\nBZ magnetic field components in the GSM coordinate sys-\ntem; the residual magnetic field components (DBX, DBY,\nand DBZ) after subtraction of the (T01) model magnetic\nfield from the observed field; BZ component measurements,\nband\u2010pass filtered to reveal oscillations in the Ps6 pulsation\nrange; BZ component measurements, band\u2010pass filtered to\nreveal oscillations in the Pi2 pulsation range.\n[28] Figure 6 (eighth and ninth panels) present the electric\nfield measurements made by the Cluster 3 EFW instrument\nand the E \u00d7 B plasma velocity (VE \u00d7 B) based on combined\nmagnetic and electric field measurements. All data are\npresented according to a common universal time axis that is\nalso labeled in terms of the magnetic latitude and magnetic\nlatitude of the satellite\u2019s T01 footprint and its radial distance\nfrom the Earth. The time at which the Cluster 3 satellite\ncrossed the central magnetic meridian of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI is\nindicated by a dashed vertical line.\n[29] At 2300 UT (the start of the interval presented in\nFigure 6), Cluster 3, located \u223c5 RE from the Earth, was\nmoving southward toward the equatorial plane in the 2 MLT\nsector. Over the next 3 h, the satellite\u2019s elliptical orbit took it\nsouthward and slightly dawnward, traversing the inner edge\nof the plasma sheet and doubling its radial distance from the\nEarth by 0200 UT.\n[30] Throughout the interval, the Cluster 3 PEACE elec-\ntron detectors observed a population of 1 to 10 keV electron\nin the field parallel, perpendicular and antiparallel directions\n(clearest in the field perpendicular energy\u2010time spectro-\ngram). We note that high\u2010energy field antiparallel mea-\nsurements from the PEACE HEEA sensor are not available\nthroughout. Starting at \u223c2355 UT, short\u2010lived bursts of\nelectrons with dispersed energy signatures in the 0.1\u201310 keV\nrange were observed in the field parallel and antiparallel\ndirections. These electron bursts, each lasting between 5 and\n15 min, were observed intermittently until \u223c0130 UT.\n[31] Magnetic field measurements made by Cluster 3\n(Figure 6) indicate the expected decline in magnetic field\nstrength as the satellite receded from the Earth. The residual\nmagnetic field (D B), calculated by subtracting the time\u2010\nand position\u2010dependent T01 model field (parameterized by\nupstream data from THEMIS C, as described above), in-\ndicates the perturbations from the expected magnetic field.\nThroughout the 3 h interval presented in Figure 6, the DBX\ncomponent was relatively small (typically within the 0\u201310 nT\nrange) with the largest (\u223c15 nT) residuals occurring during\nCluster 3\u2019s encounters with the transient field parallel\/\nantiparallel electron fluxes. The general trend in the DBX\ncomponent (increasing from 2300 to 0000 UT, decreasing\nfrom 0000 to 0100 UT, and increasing again from 0100 to\n0200 UT with significant perturbations as the satellite was\nengulfed by energetic electrons) was repeated in the DBY\nand DBZ components. Overall, DBX, the smallest residual,\nwas positive (suggesting that the observed BX was greater\nthan predicted); DBY was generally larger and positive\n(suggesting that the observed BY was greater than pre-\ndicted); and DBZ was the largest residual and negative\n(suggesting that the observed BZ was smaller than pre-\ndicted). We note that the largest residual fields (observed\nduring several particle encounters or more generally after\n\u223c0115 UT) approached \u223c50% of the observed magnetic\nfield. The residual magnetic field data presented in Figure 6\nalso include periodic oscillations. When band\u2010pass filtered\nwith appropriate high\u2010 and low\u2010frequency cutoff filters, the\nmagnetic field measurements from Cluster revealed Ps6 and\nPi2 pulsation activity, broadly corresponding to the wave\nactivity observed by ground\u2010based magnetometers (we note\nthat for reasons of clarity, Figure 6 only presents band\u2010pass\nfiltered BZ component data, but equivalent activity is\nobserved in all three magnetic field components).\n[32] Shortly after 2330 UT, the EFW instrument began to\nrecord an increasingly variable electric field. The variability\nand strength of this field were generally related to the par-\nallel\/antiparallel electron fluxes and accompanying magnetic\ndisturbances; that is, the peak electric fields were observed\nat times when the parallel\/antiparallel electron fluxes were\nenhanced from the background level. Analysis of the electric\nfield data between 2330 and 0130 UT revealed a dominant,\n150 s oscillation in all three components. In the magnetic\nfield data, perturbations with \u223c900 s periodicity dominate,\nwith lower power peaks in the frequency spectrum corre-\nsponding to 450, 300 and 150 s periodicities. When com-\nbined to estimate the local plasma velocity, these\nmeasurements reveal that VE \u00d7 B was generally largest at\nFigure 6. Electron flux and magnetic field measurements from the Cluster 3 satellites. The first to third panels present\nPEACE energy\u2010time spectrograms of differential energy flux (DEF) parallel, perpendicular and antiparallel to the local mag-\nnetic field. DEF is color\u2010coded according to the color bar on the right side. The fourth and fifth panels show the GSM mag-\nnetic field components measured by the FGM experiment (BGSM) and the residual magnetic field components (DBGSM) that\nremain following subtraction of the local magnetic field predicted by the T01 magnetospheric field model. The sixth and\nseventh panels show BZ component data, band\u2010pass filtered to reveal pulsations in the Ps6 and Pi2 frequency ranges, respec-\ntively. The eighth and ninth panels present electric field measurements from the EFW experiment and the resulting VE \u00d7 B,\nrespectively. All panels are plotted according to a common universal time axis. The magnetic latitude and local time of the\nsatellite\u2019s footprint, as well as its radial displacement from the center of the Earth, are also indicated. The time at which the\nsatellite\u2019s footprint crossed the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI MLT meridian is indicated by a dashed vertical line.\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n10 of 20\ntimes when high parallel\/antiparallel electron fluxes in the\n\u223ckeV energy range were observed.\n4. Discussion\n[33] In section 3, we introduced ground\u2010based observa-\ntions of omega bands propagating eastward along the\npoleward boundary of an east\u2010west aligned auroral arc. In\nthis section, we examine the bands\u2019 structure and evolution\nin the context of the geomagnetic and magnetospheric\nconditions that prevailed at the time.\n4.1. Ionospheric Electrodynamics\n[34] The auroral and magnetic measurements presented in\nFigure 4 clearly indicate substorm activity in the late hours\nof 27 September 2009. In the hour prior to 0000 UT on the\n28 September, typical growth phase conditions were\nobserved during a period of steady southward IMF. Spe-\ncifically, a quiet auroral arc was observed to drift equator-\nward for an hour or more before brightening at 2333:36 UT.\nAlthough it occurred at the same time as a weak (\u223c5 nT\npeak\u2010to\u2010peak amplitude), short\u2010lived (<3 min duration) Pi2\npulsation, and was followed by a faint poleward drifting arc,\nthis auroral brightening was not accompanied by significant\nlocal or global magnetic disturbances. However, the subse-\nquent burst of Pi2 activity, starting at 2240:00 UT, was\nfollowed by the brightening and northward expansion of the\npoleward auroral arc. The auroral dynamics were accompa-\nnied by a steady decrease in the H component of the magnetic\nfield, indicating a strengthening of the overhead westward\nelectrojet, and a sharp increase in the AE index, indicating a\nglobal intensification of the auroral zone electrojets. After\ncontinued growth of the AE index, auroral dynamics and Pi2\nactivity increased considerably at 2357:12 UT and ground\nmagnetometer data indicated a sudden deepening of the\nobserved H component negative bay.\n[35] We interpret these observations as evidence of multi-\nstage substorm activity. We suggest that the first stage,\nstarting at 2333:36 UT, was a pseudobeakup that did not\nevolve into a full substorm. However, the second stage,\nstarting with the Pi2 pulsations observed at 2340:00 UT,\ndeveloped into a full substorm and marked the onset of the\nexpansion phase. This expansion phase was characterized by\npoleward moving auroral structures, the brightening and\nbroadening of an equatorward arc and enhanced electrojet\ncurrents. The third stage comprised a sharp intensification of\nthe substorm expansion phase at 2357:12 UT, leading to\nincreased currents flowing overhead and a sudden increase in\nauroral dynamics. The inferred timing of these three stages,\nlabeled \u201cpsuedobreakup\u201d, \u201csubstorm onset\u201d and \u201csubstorm\nintensification\u201d, are indicated at the top of Figure 4. Inspec-\ntion of individual auroral images (Figures 5a\u20135e) indicates\nthat the substorm expansion phase onset was initiated in the\npremidnight MLT sector, westward (duskward) of the\nTj\u00f6rnes ASI. This location is consistent with the typical\npremidnight location of the auroral brightenings associated\nwith expansion phase onset [e.g., Frey et al., 2004].\n[36] Within a few minutes of the substorm expansion\nphase onset and subsequent intensification, auroral omega\nbands were observed propagating eastward (dawnward)\nfrom the onset region. Typically, the auroral structures\nextended \u223c200 km in the north\u2010south direction and \u223c150 km\nin the east\u2010west direction. Based upon their transit time\nacross the ASI field of view, their eastward propagation\nspeed was estimated to be \u223c400 m s\u22121. At the time these\nstructures were observed, the poleward edge of the main\nauroral arc was located overhead the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI such that\nthe omega\u2010shaped torches extended to the north of the\nzenith (and the northern coastline of Iceland). Nevertheless,\nthe Tj\u00f6rnes magnetometer (which integrates over a region\nspanning several hundred kilometers) recorded Ps6 pulsa-\ntions during the passage of the omega bands. When plotted\nas ionospheric equivalent currents, these magnetic pertur-\nbations are consistent with the passage of vortical iono-\nspheric Hall currents associated with upward\/downward\nfield\u2010aligned currents over the magnetometer [L\u00fchr and\nSchlegel, 1994; Wild et al., 2000].\n[37] The average line\u2010of\u2010sight ionospheric flow velocity in\nthe main band of radar backscatter in beam 5 (the region\nbetween the dashed lines in the radar\/ASI panels of Figure 4)\nwas generally directed away from the radar. Given the ori-\nentation of the beam (northward and eastward), the precise\ndirection of this flow cannot be resolved unambiguously.\nHowever, the average LOS velocity increased rapidly from\nzero at the beginning of the interval (when limited back-\nscattered signals were available) to over 200 m s\u22121 away\nfrom the radar during the flow burst, which coincided with\nthe substorm expansion phase onset. A second high\u2010speed\nflow burst between 0015 and 0020 UT corresponded to a\nbright auroral transient that formed simultaneously with\nomega band iii in Figure 4; otherwise, there is no clear\ncorrelation between the relatively steady \u223c100 m s\u22121 flow\naway from the radar and omega band passage. In the case of\nthe omega bands labeled i and iii, there is some evidence of\nbackscatter feature recession from the radar (migration to\nincreasing latitudes) as the auroral structures crossed the ASI\nmeridian.\n[38] The enhanced background flow observed is consis-\ntent with large\u2010scale convection development during the\nsubstorm. No direct relationship with the omega band\nstructures is expected [e.g., Grocott et al., 2002]. On the\nother hand, Grocott et al. [2004] observed the flow signa-\nture of a substorm pseudobreakup and concurrent bursty\nbulk flow in the magnetosphere. In this case the flow sig-\nnature was of a more vortical nature, being related to the\nassociated field\u2010aligned current system. The similarly vor-\ntical nature of the omega band current system could there-\nfore explain the poleward component of the flow features\nobserved in this case.\n4.2. Magnetic Field Line Mapping\n[39] The Cluster 3 field and plasma observations intro-\nduced in Figure 6 indicated structured particle fluxes in the\nmagnetotail when the suite of ground\u2010based instruments\nobserved the eastward propagating auroral omega bands. In\norder to investigate any possible link, we present field\nparallel electron fluxes observed by all four Cluster satellites\n(Figure 7) and indicate the footprint location of each satellite\nrelative to the auroral observations discussed above. The\nlatitudinal profiles of the Cluster footprints are overlaid on\nthe ASI keogram and SuperDARN velocity panels included\nin Figure 4. In terms of the motion of the footprint during\nthe interval under study, the slightly duskward orbital\nmotion of the satellite is less significant that the dawnward\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n11 of 20\nFigure 7\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n12 of 20\nrotation of the Earth, which steadily brings the ASI FOV\nunder the Cluster magnetic footprints. As indicated in\nFigures 1, 2 and 5, Cluster 2 (red) was located farthest from\nthe Earth and at the earliest MLT of the four satellites. Its\nfootprint was therefore located farther west and at the\nhighest magnetic latitude of the four satellites. Cluster 1\n(black), 3 (green) and 4 (blue) are located at similar mag-\nnetic local times, with 3 and 4 slightly closer to the Earth.\nThese three satellites have magnetic footprints at similar\nmagnetic local times (within 0.2 h of MLT); Cluster 1\u2019s\nfootprint is located \u223c1\u00b0 of magnetic latitude poleward of the\nCluster 3 and 4 footprints at the start of the interval\n(reducing to \u223c0.5\u00b0 by the end).\n[40] As discussed above, comparisons between the mod-\neled and observed magnetic field at the location of Cluster 3\nindicate that the T01 model (exploited to estimate the\nCluster magnetic footprints) did not fully reflect the actual\nmagnetospheric field configuration during the interval of\ninterest. Residual magnetic fields suggest that the actual\nfield was more stretched (with larger BX and BY, but smaller\nBZ) than predicted for the T01 model. The sense and tem-\nporal evolution of these residuals were consistent with\nsubstorm activity inferred from ground\u2010based observations.\nThe residual fields increased during the growth phase as the\ntail field became increasingly stretched. They subsequently\ndecreased as the tail field dipolarized during the expansion\nphase, with brief disturbances due to the passage of bursts of\nenergetic electrons moving parallel and antiparallel to the\nlocal field line.\n[41] As might be expected, this suggests that the reliability\nof the magnetic field model used is uncertain during the late\ngrowth phase and early expansion phase of the substorm.\nNevertheless, the model is required to estimate the satellite\nfootprints in the ionosphere. Uncertainties are expected to be\ngreatest during the Cluster 2 passage through the ASI field\nof view in the early part of expansion phase. However, for\noperational reasons, electron measurements are only avail-\nable from Cluster 2 until just after midnight on 28 Sep-\ntember, before it had passed over the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI site. The\nestimated Cluster 2 footprint (with questionable reliability)\nwas poleward (tailward) of the auroral omega bands and,\nwith the exception of brief, glancing encounters with the\npoleward boundary of omega band torches, did not traverse\nauroral structures until the latter part of the interval when the\naurora had expanded poleward to fill the ASI field of view.\nHowever, the remaining Cluster satellites (1, 3, and 4) were\nrecording throughout the conjunction with the ground\u2010based\nexperiments, and magnetic field line mapping from the\nmagnetosphere to the ionosphere is essential to this study.\n[42] To estimate the level of uncertainty in field line\nmapping during overflights of the remaining Cluster satel-\nlites spacecraft through the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI, the T01 mapping\nemployed in this study has been compared to equivalent\nmapping using the Tsyganenko 1996 (T96) model\n[Tsyganenko, 1995]. Although it does not yield definitive\nmapping errors, this benchmarking reveals the extent to\nwhich the field line mapping depends on the specific mag-\nnetospheric field model selected. We therefore recompute\nthe Cluster footprints using the T96 model using identical\ninput parameters and compare the results to those from the\nT01 model. Between 2200 and 0200 UT, the average dis-\nplacement between the Cluster footprints estimated by the\ntwo models is \u223c0.5 degrees of magnetic latitude and \u223c0.25\ndegrees of magnetic longitude (approximately 1 min of\nmagnetic local time). In the ionosphere (at 110 km altitude)\nthis corresponds to a distance of approximately 50 km. At\n0100 UT, when Cluster 1, 3 and 4 were in the vicinity of the\nTj\u00f6rnes ASI meridian, the westward horizontal speed of the\nfootprints at 110 km altitude was \u223c0.25 km s\u22121, irrespective\nof the magnetospheric model selected. As such, the \u223c0.25\u00b0\nlongitudinal difference in the T01 and T96 footprints cor-\nresponds to a difference in arrival time at a specific magnetic\nmeridian of \u223c45 s, with the T01 footprints consistently\nlocated slightly poleward and westward of the T96 foot-\nprints at any given universal time. We therefore conclude\nthat although the two Tsyganenko field models predict\nslightly different satellite footprint locations (for a given set\nof input parameters), the discrepancy is not significant.\nUltimately, the choice of magnetospheric model is not\ncritical to the analysis that follows and the selection of the\nT01 (inner magnetosphere) model is appropriate.\n4.3. Magnetosphere\u2013Ionosphere Coupling\n[43] Although the footprints of the Cluster 1, 3 and 4\nsatellites were at latitudes comparable to the omega bands,\nthey did not encounter the eastward moving auroral struc-\ntures until after \u223c0019 UT, when residual magnetic fields at\nthe satellites were much reduced compared to those\nencountered by Cluster 2 (some 30 min earlier). We there-\nfore use the estimated footprints to compare in situ mea-\nsurements at the remaining satellites and the auroral\nluminosity at each satellite\u2019s footprint. Figure 8 presents this\ncomparison for Clusters 1, 3 and 4.\n[44] The brightness in Figure 8 is at the satellite\u2019s\nNorthern Hemisphere magnetic footprint. To take into\naccount small uncertainties in the magnetic field mapping,\nthe auroral brightness at each time has been calculated by\naveraging over a 25 km radius area centered on the esti-\nmated footprint position. The diameter of the averaging\nregion is therefore comparable to the displacement found\nbetween the footprints yielded by the T01 and T96 magnetic\nfield models in the benchmarking exercise described above.\nFigure 8 shows the time series of auroral luminosity aver-\naged around each footprint as the satellite overflew the\nTj\u00f6rnes ASI. The black trace indicating auroral luminosity is\ndotted when the satellite footprint is within 10\u00b0 of elevation\nFigure 7. Field\u2010parallel electron differential energy fluxes measured at Cluster 1, 2, 3 and 4 (third to sixth panels). Fluxes\nare color\u2010coded as a function of universal time and particle energy according to the color bar on the right side. To compare\nthe in situ measurements with ionosphere observations, the first and second panels show the SuperDARN and all\u2010sky\nimager data presented in Figure 4 on which each satellite\u2019s magnetic footprint has been indicated by a colored dashed\nline (C1, blank\/white; C2, red\/white; C3, green\/white; C4, blue\/white). Furthermore, each electron energy\u2010time spectrogram\nis annotated with the MLT of that satellite\u2019s footprint (horizontal axis) and the time at which the footprint crosses the\nmagnetic meridian of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI (dashed vertical line).\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n13 of 20\nFigure 8\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n14 of 20\nfrom the local horizon (where uncertainties in the all\u2010sky\nprojection are most sensitive to the assumed emission alti-\ntude) and solid where the footprint is >10\u00b0 from the horizon.\n[45] Sk in Figure 8 is the Poynting flux and integrated\nelectron energy flux based on in situ plasma measurements.\nElectric and magnetic field measurements from the Cluster\nEFW and FGM instruments have been used to calculate\nfield\u2010aligned Poynting flux, Sk, at the satellite location:\nSk \u00bc S \u0003 BBj j \u00f01\u00de\nwhere B is the local magnetic field and S is the Poynting\nvector. As described by Keiling et al. [2002], to calculate the\nPoynting flux vector, perturbation electric (dE) and mag-\nnetic (dB) fields are combined; thus,\nS \u00bc 1\n\u00010\n\u0003E\u0004 \u0003B \u00f02\u00de\nThe field\u2010aligned Poynting flux, Sk, indicated by the black\ntrace, accounts for the transport of energy along the back-\nground magnetic field. The ratio of the integrated electron\nenergy fluxes parallel and perpendicular to the local mag-\nnetic field is shown for comparison (dotted green trace).\nThis is computed by summing the differential energy flux\n(DEF) of over all energy ranges covered by the PEACE\ninstrument in the pitch angle bin containing the local field,\nthen dividing by the equivalent integrated energy flux from\nthe orthogonal pitch angle bin. Values of this ratio >1\nindicate that the field\u2010aligned electron energy flux exceeds\nthe field\u2010perpendicular energy flux. Values <1 indicate that\nthe field\u2010perpendicular electron energy flux is greater.\n[46] The e\u2212 DEF in Figure 8 is the field\u2010aligned differ-\nential energy flux (DEF) observed by the PEACE instru-\nment in two representative electron energy ranges. Although\nthe exact energy bins differ very slightly between the\nPEACE sensors on each satellite, comparable energy levels\nhave been selected in each case. Electron DEF in a \u223c100 eV\nwide energy bin centered on approximately 500 eV is\nindicated by the blue trace, and DEF in a \u223c700 eV wide\nenergy bin centered on approximately 3 keV range is shown\nby the red trace. The central energies of each bin are indi-\ncated in Figure 8.\n[47] The footprints of the Cluster 1, 3 and 4 satellites\nentered the \u201ccentral\u201d portion of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI field of\nview (>10\u00b0 from the horizon) at 0025 UT, 0022 UT and\n0019 UT, respectively. By the time they had traversed the\neastern half of the field of view and arrived at the central\nmeridian of the ASI (indicated by dashed vertical lines at\n0102 UT (Cluster 1), 0057 UT (Cluster 3) and 0056 UT\n(Cluster 4) in Figure 8), a series of omega bands had been\nencountered. Examination of individual ASI frames in-\ndicates that Cluster 3 and 4 cut though the omega bands\nlabeled as iii, iv, and v in Figures 4 and 5 with corre-\nsponding peaks in the brightness traces for these satellites\n(labeled iii\u2013v in Figure 8). We note that the peak at 0051 UT\nin the Cluster 3 and 4 brightness traces corresponded to an\nencounter with a narrow arc that briefly formed poleward of\nthe main arc (Figure 5l) and not an omega band attached to\nthe main arc. Cluster 1, at slightly higher latitude, did not\npass though any omega band structures.\n[48] As discussed above, the Cluster 3 electron energy\u2010\ntime spectra presented in Figure 6 reveal a high\u2010energy (1\u2013\n10 keV) electron population in the magnetotail, evident at all\npitch angles. In addition, short\u2010lived enhancements in the\ndifferential energy flux carried by electrons in the lower, 0.1\u2013\n1 keV range in the field parallel and antiparallel directions\nwere observed, starting at \u223c0000 UT. Although Figure 6\npresents measurements from Cluster 3 only, similar struc-\ntures were also observed at Cluster 1 and 4 (no Cluster 2\nelectron data were available after 0005 UT). These data\nindicate a large differential energy flux of high\u2010energy\nelectrons during the interval in which auroral omega bands\nwere observed. The high\u2010energy population has strongest\nfluxes perpendicular to the magnetic field, suggesting that it\nis a largely trapped population. The angular resolution of the\nPEACE instrument is 15\u00b0 in the plane parallel to the satellite\nspin axis and 11.25\u00b0 in the plane perpendicular to the spin\naxis. Since the loss cone of precipitating electrons is likely to\nbe \u223c3\u00b0, the field\u2010aligned energy\u2010time spectra will contain a\nmixture of precipitating and trapped electrons. Conversely,\nthe lower\u2010energy electrons were only observed in the field\u2010\naligned (parallel and antiparallel) sensor, suggesting that the\nelectrons observed in the parallel pitch angle bin were more\nlikely to precipitate into the auroral zone, with the remainder\nof that population mirroring at lower altitudes and being\nobserved at antiparallel pitch angles.\n[49] The auroral brightness time series for the Cluster 3\nfootprint shown in Figure 8 includes the clear signatures of\nthree omega bands. These features, which are labeled iii\u2013iv,\nand v, correspond to similarly labeled features in Figure 5.\nNote that these features move eastward through Cluster 3\u2019s\nfootprint between 0025 and 0050 UT, while the footprint is\nin the eastern portion of the FOV (i.e., prior to the transit of\nthe satellite through the ASI\u2019s magnetic local time meridian,\nindicated by the dashed vertical line in Figure 8). Between\n0000 and 0100 UT (corresponding to the satellite\u2019s passage\nthrough this eastern portion of the imager), the field\u2010aligned\nPoynting flux exhibits the same \u223c150 s variability observed\nin the underlying electric field data, with localized peaks in\nFigure 8. Comparisons between in situ field and plasma measurements at the Cluster satellites and auroral brightness at the\nionospheric footprint (Cluster 1, 3, and 4). For brightness plots the black trace shows the auroral brightness (arbitrary units)\nat the location of the satellite\u2019s footprint. The brightness trace is dotted where the footprint is within 10\u00b0 of the local horizon\nat the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI, but is presented as a solid line where the footprint lies more than 10\u00b0 from the imager\u2019s local horizon.\nThe field\u2010aligned Poynting flux Sk (derived from electric and magnetic field measurements) is shown in black, and the ratio\nof field\u2010parallel to field\u2010perpendicular integrated electron flux is shown in dotted green (according to the scale on the right).\nThe blue trace shows the DEF of electrons in the PEACE 500 eV energy bin; the red trace shows the DEF of electrons in the\n3 keV energy bin. All panels are plotted according to a common universal time axis and are annotated with the MLT of that\nsatellite\u2019s footprint and the time at which the footprint crosses the magnetic meridian of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI (dashed vertical\nline). Auroral omega bands discussed in the text are labeled iii\u2013v.\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n15 of 20\nthe envelope centered at 0002 and 0018 UT. The parallel\u2010\nto\u2010perpendicular electron energy flux ratio was typically less\nthan unity (indicating that electron energy flux in the field\u2010\nperpendicular direction exceeded that in the field\u2010parallel\ndirection) and displayed similar short\u2010period variability,\nwith peaks at 0006UT, 0022UT and 0048UT. The differential\nenergy flux of electrons in the \u223c3 keV energy range remained\nrelatively constant throughout the interval, although modest\n(up to \u223c50%) variations were observed (such as between\n0000 and 0010 UT). In contrast, the differential energy flux\ncarried by low\u2010energy electrons (\u223c500 eV shown in Figure 8)\nvaried by more than an order of magnitude throughout the\ninterval, with the higher\u2010flux intervals corresponding to the\nbursts of parallel\/antiparallel electrons shown in the PEACE\nelectron spectra (Figure 6).\n[50] As the Cluster 3 footprint approached the Tj\u00f6rnes\nASI central meridian at 0057 UT, the aurora expanded\npoleward (as shown in the keogram in Figure 6). Conse-\nquently, as the satellite traversed the western half of the\nimager\u2019s FOV, it overflew dynamic auroral structures\nincluding, for example, a spatially localized brightening at\n0101 UT, but no additional distinct omega bands. The\nauroral brightness at the footprint was high and variable\nover the following half hour until the satellite left the FOV.\nThe field\u2010aligned Poynting flux estimated from electric and\nmagnetic field data was markedly lower during this interval\nthan during the preceding hour, but fluctuations in the ratio\nof parallel\u2010to\u2010perpendicular integrated electron energy flux\ncontinued, driven by bursts of both high\u2010 and low\u2010energy\nfield\u2010aligned electron flux. After \u223c0130, the lower\u2010energy\nelectron DEF declined sharply, whereas the higher\u2010energy\nelectron DEF increased very slightly.\n[51] To summarize the relevant Cluster 3 measurements,\nthe calculated field\u2010aligned Poynting flux varied rapidly\nthroughout the interval when the satellite was conjugate to\nomega bands iii\u2013v. The energy flux ratio between electrons\nmoving in the field\u2010parallel and field\u2010perpendicular direc-\ntions indicates that more flux was included in the latter, but\nthe ratio fluctuated upward several times during the 0025 to\n0100 UT interval in which the three omega bands were\nobserved. Given the generally steady field\u2010perpendicular\ndifferential energy flux observed during this period (as\nshown in Figure 6), this increase in the field parallel\/\nperpendicular ratio indicates enhancements in the field\u2010\nparallel direction. An exception is the sharp increase in the\nflux ratio at 0048 UT due to a simultaneous increase in the\nfield\u2010parallel flux and a decrease in the field perpendicular\nflux (clearly apparent in Figure 6). Scrutiny of individual\nelectron energy channels of the PEACE instrument reveals\nthat this increase in the amount of field\u2010parallel differential\nenergy flux is associated with large (factor of 10) en-\nhancements in the flux of lower\u2010energy electrons (illustra-\ntive \u223c500 eV electrons shown in Figure 8).\n[52] Any one\u2010to\u2010one correspondence between the auroral\nomega bands at the footprint of the Cluster 3 satellite and\nfield and plasma measurements is not obvious. The fluc-\ntuations in Poynting flux indicate variable transport of\nenergy along the background magnetic field toward the\nionosphere, and the particle data indicate intervals of\nincreased electron energy flux in the field\u2010parallel direction,\nmainly carried by low\u2010energy electrons (<1 keV). There is a\nsuggestion of localized peaks in the flux ratio as the satellite\npassed over omega bands iii\u2013v, but these are by no means\nthe greatest flux ratios observed. The large peak in the flux\nratio at 0048 UT follows omega band v by \u223c4 min but\nprecedes a short\u2010duration enhancement in auroral brightness\nat 0051 UT. As noted previously, inspection of individual\nASI frames reveals that this enhancement is a due to a\nnarrow (\u223c10 km), faint, and short\u2010lived (\u223c2 min) arc that\nappeared poleward of the main region of auroral emission\n(as shown in Figure 5l).\n[53] Perhaps unsurprisingly (given the proximity of the\nsatellites and their footprints), the Cluster 4 field and plasma\nmeasurements are very similar to those from Cluster 3. The\nsatellites encountered the three omega bands (iii\u2013v) prior to\ncrossing the central meridian of the Tj\u00f6rnes ASI (i.e., during\nthe interval 0025 to 0050 UT) and also crossed the short\u2010\nlived faint arc poleward of the main auroral emission at\n0051 UT and the localized brightenings within the expanded\narea of auroral emissions after \u223c0100 UT (all observed by\nCluster 3). Variations in the field\u2010aligned Poynting flux, the\nparallel\u2010to\u2010perpendicular integrated electron energy flux\nand the high (\u223c3 keV) and low (\u223c500 eV) electron differ-\nential energy fluxes were very similar to those observed by\nCluster 3. The magnetospheric field and plasma structures\nobserved by these satellites must therefore have spanned a\nregion of the magnetosphere comparable in size to the sat-\nellite separation distance (approximately 1100 km through-\nout the interval presented in Figure 6).\n[54] Previous studies [e.g., Wygant et al., 2000; Keiling\net al., 2002] have compared in situ magnetospheric elec-\ntric and magnetic field measurements with space\u2010based\nauroral imagery to study the relationship between Alfv\u00e9n\nwave Poynting flux and auroral features. In the case pre-\nsented above, there was no one\u2010to\u2010one correspondence\nbetween peaks in Poynting flux observed at Cluster and\npeaks in auroral brightness due to omega bands. However,\nthe average field\u2010aligned Poynting flux measured by\nCluster 3 and 4 during the first hour of the interval pre-\nsented in Figure 8 (when omega bands were observed at\nthe satellite footprints) was more than five times higher\nthan during the following hour (when no omega bands\nwere observed). Also, the average field\u2010aligned Poynting\nflux observed by Cluster 1 during the 0000 to 0100 UT\nperiod (as it overflew the region poleward of the omega\nbands) was only 20\u201330% of that observed by Cluster 3 and 4\n(as they cut through the omega bands).\n[55] To identify Alfv\u00e9n wave activity at the satellite\nlocation, we compared the ratio of the two perpendicular\nperturbation fields, dE and dB, to the local Alfv\u00e9n speed\n[Keiling, 2009]. Given the significant residual field that\nremained after the T01 model magnetic field was subtracted\nfrom the Cluster data (Figure 6), we have not used the T01\nto determine the local magnetic field direction. Instead, we\nestimate B at the satellite by applying a 10 min running\naverage to the FGM data. Electric and magnetic field vectors\nare then transformed into a field\u2010aligned coordinate system\n(l, m, n), such that the n axis is directed parallel to B; the\nm axis is perpendicular to the n axis and the ZGSM direction;\nthe l axis completes the right\u2010handed set and is perpendic-\nular to both m and n. Given the approximately Earthward\ndirected field at the satellite\u2019s position, l is directed per-\npendicular to B and approximately northward, m is directed\nperpendicular to B and approximately eastward.\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n16 of 20\n[56] Figure 9 shows example hodograms, derived from\nthe field\u2010perpendicular electric and magnetic field fluctua-\ntions measured by Cluster 3. The approximately circular loci\nof points demonstrate that the phase relationship between\nthe dBl and dEm components (and the relationship between\ndEl and dBm components) is \u223c90\u00b0. This suggests that the\nobserved field perturbations are a result of propagating shear\nAlfv\u00e9n waves. Between 0030 and 0100 UT, the field\u2010\nperpendicular component of the electric field perturbations\n(dE?\n2 = dEl\n2 + dEm\n2 ) varied between 0.5 and 2.0 mV m\u22121,\nwith a mean of 1.0 mV m\u22121; the equivalent component of the\nmagnetic field perturbations (dB?\n2 = dBl\n2 + dBm\n2 ) varied\nbetween 0.5 and 5.0 nT, with a mean of 2.1 nT. The resulting\nE\/B fluctuation ratio varied between 100 and 2500 km s\u22121,\nwith a mean ratio of 1062 km s\u22121. This is comparable to the\nlocal Alfv\u00e9n speed of \u223c1000 km s\u22121, based upon Cluster in\nsitu field and plasma parameters. The field\u2010aligned Poynting\nflux and the correlated electric and magnetic field per-\nturbations observed at Cluster 3 are thus consistent with\nthe propagation of shear Alfv\u00e9n waves along the mag-\nnetic field. Crucially, the field\u2010parallel Poynting vector at\nCluster 3 and 4 is almost always positive, implying wave\nenergy is being transferred from the plasma sheet to the\nionosphere and is not reflected. This is consistent with the\npropagating shear Alfv\u00e9n waves described by Watt and\nRankin [2010] and may account for the source of the accel-\nerated particle energy.\n[57] Although a one\u2010to\u2010one causal relationship cannot be\nfound, the overall picture that emerges from the in situ\nmagnetospheric data suggests shear Alfv\u00e9n wave activity in\nthe plasma sheet\u2010accelerated electrons, typically with energy\n<3 keV, Earthward along the magnetic field line from a\nlocation tailward of the Cluster 3 and 4 satellites (>8 RE\ndowntail). In situ values of Poynting flux can be extrapolated\nto ionospheric altitudes by multiplying the in situ flux by a\nfactor equal to the ratio of the background magnetic field\nstrength at the location of the in situ measurements to the\nmagnetic field strength at ionospheric altitude [Wygant et al.,\n2000]. Using values of \u223c50 nT for the in situ field (observed\nby Cluster 3 at 0030 UT) and an ionospheric field at 110 km\nof 50,000 nT, the amplification factor due to the converging\nfield lines in the vicinity of the Earth is \u223c1000. Consequently,\nthe field\u2010aligned Poynting flux observed by Cluster 3 and 4\ncorresponded to a flux at ionospheric altitude of up to\n100 mWm\u22122, but averaging 17 and 13 mWm\u22122 for Cluster 3\nand 4, respectively, between 0000 and 0100 UT.\n[58] In a statistical study of 40 plasma sheet crossings by\nthe Polar satellite, Keiling et al. [2002] compared mapped\n(ionospheric) peak Poynting flux with electron energy flux\nestimated from ultraviolet auroral images. They concluded\nthat Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting flux in the midtail region (4\u20137 RE) is\nassociated with and capable of powering localized regions\nof magnetically conjugate auroral emissions. Recent mod-\neling work by Watt and Rankin [2010] indicated that in\nFigure 9.

Although the Poynting fluxes observed in this\nstudy are at the lower range of those reported by Keiling et\nal. [2002], we interpret the observation of enhanced and\nvariable Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting flux, accompanied by bursts of\nfield\u2010aligned electron flux in the plasma sheet during an\ninterval in which auroral omega bands were observed, as\nevidence that these auroral structures are related to beams of\nelectrons accelerated in the midtail plasma sheet.\n4.4. Omega Band Structure and Formation\n[59] The omega bands observed on the night of 27\u201328\nSeptember 2009 were somewhat atypical in several respects.\nFirst, they were observed close to magnetic midnight,\nwhereas the vast majority of previous studies classified\nomega bands as a morning sector phenomenon. Second, the\nomega bands presented here were observed a few minutes\nafter a substorm expansion phase onset (based upon mag-\nnetic field measurements and global auroral indices), rather\nthan during the substorm recovery phase as is usually\nreported. Specifically, in this case study, the omega bands\nappear to emerge from the onset region located in the pre-\nmidnight sector just westward (duskward) of the Tj\u00f6rnes\nASI. Although relatively small (\u223c200 km scale size), the\nomega bands drifted eastward, i.e., away from the onset\nregion and toward dawn, at \u223c0.4 km s\u22121. Given that L\u00fchr\nand Schlegel [1994] argued that omega bands and Ps6\npulsations are \u201cessentially the same phenomenon seen by\ndifferent instruments\u201d, the magnetic measurements pre-\nsented above confirm that the optical signatures observed\nwere indeed omega bands (albeit relatively small, slowly\nmoving examples).\n[60] Although previous studies [e.g., L\u00fchr and Schlegel,\n1994; Wild et al., 2000] have reported strong ionospheric\nplasma velocity shears at the boundary between the bright\nand dark regions of the omega band, there is little evidence\nof this effect in the features presented here. As indicted\nearlier, at the relatively short range (\u223c250 km) at which the\nSuperDARN Iceland East radar was sounding the auroral\noval, it is likely that the radar pulses were being back-\nscattered by E (rather than F ) region ionospheric plasma\nirregularities. Because of collisions between ionospheric\nions and atmospheric neutrals, a two\u2010stream instability\nlimits the speed of the E region electron density irregulari-\nties exploited by the radar as backscatter targets [Robinson,\n1986]. Furthermore, due to the line\u2010of\u2010sight nature of the\nradar measurements, only a component of the true flow is\nmeasured by a single radar. As a result, the radar data pre-\nsented above may have underestimated the true ionospheric\nplasma flow velocity.\n[61] Uncertainties in the magnetic field model make\ndetailed comparisons between ionospheric and magneto-\nspheric measurements difficult. The superior temporal and\nspatial resolution of the ground\u2010based auroral images\navailable here (at least an order of magnitude higher than\nauroral image data yielded by space\u2010based imagers, both\nspatially and temporally) highlights limitations in the map-\nping capability. Despite the lack of a one\u2010to\u2010one correlation\nbetween auroral features and satellite measurements, the in\nsitu data suggest that electrons accelerated in the midtail\nplasma sheet powered auroral emissions during the interval\nin which the omega bands were observed.\n[62] An interesting question left unanswered by this study\nis that of the fate of the omega bands after they left the\nTj\u00f6rnes ASI field of view. It is not clear whether these\nstructures continued to propagate eastward and, if they did,\nhow they evolved as they moved through the morning\nsector. Although we have been unable to find clear\u2010sky\nauroral images from Scandinavia for this interval, IMAGE\nmagnetometer data from the Scandinavian sector indicated\nPs6 pulsation activity. This raises the possibility that stable\nomega bands might propagate dawnward over many hours\nof magnetic local time, retreating from the substorm onset\nregion in the vicinity of the midnight sector. If true, this\ncould account for the general association between omega\nbands and the substorm recovery phase. If, as in the case\nstudy presented above, omega bands are formed in the\nvicinity of the midnight sector shortly after expansion onset\/\nintensification, a steady eastward propagation would imply a\ndelay before their observation in the morning\/dawn sector.\nEastward motion over 4 h of MLT at 0.4\u20132.0 km s\u22121 would\ntake between 20 and 100 min (at 68\u00b0 magnetic latitude),\nimplying that faster moving omega bands launched eastward\nfrom substorm onset in the midnight sector would arrive in\nthe morning sector during the substorm recovery phase.\nGiven the growing international archive of space\u2010 and\nground\u2010based auroral imagery that provides regional and\nglobal auroral imaging capabilities and multisatellite mag-\nnetosphere satellite missions, this question should be\nresolvable in the future.\n[63] Omega bands have traditionally been linked with the\nsubstorm recovery phase [e.g., Opgenoorth et al., 1994] and\nassociated with Ps6 magnetic pulsations in ground mag-\nnetometer data [Andr\u00e9 and Baumjohann, 1982; Opgenoorth\net al., 1983; Steen et al., 1988]. However, a variety of studies\nhave linked these ionospheric phenomena to sources in the\nmagnetosphere. For example, Steen et al. [1988] suggested\nthat variations in the high\u2010energy particle intensity at geo-\nsynchronous orbit are responsible for the generation of\nauroral omega bands, a proposal later supported by the\nfindings of Tagirov [1993], who used the Tsyganenko T89\nmagnetospheric magnetic field model to demonstrate that\nauroral torches map to the equatorial plane 5\u20136 RE from the\nEarth. Subsequent studies linked omega bands to the mag-\nnetotail plasma sheet, with Jorgensen et al. [1999] con-\ncluding that they are the electrodynamic signature of the\ncorrugated inner edge of a current sheet in the vicinity of\ngeostationary orbit. Pulkkinen et al. [1991] exploited the\nTsyganenko model to show that the omega bands and Ps6\npulsation map to the current sheet approximately 6\u201313 RE\ndowntail from the Earth.\n[64] Despite growing evidence that the source region of\nomega bands\/Ps6 pulsations lies in (or at the boundary of) the\ncurrent sheet, the source mechanism remains unclear. Pro-\nposed mechanisms include the development of the Kelvin\u2010\nHelmholtz instability at the boundary between the boundary\nlayer plasma sheet and the central plasma sheet due to flow\nshear [Rostoker and Samson, 1984], an interchange insta-\nbility developing on the outer boundary of a hot plasma torus\n[Yamamoto et al., 1997], and spatially periodic electron\nprecipitation caused by field\u2010aligned electric fields generated\nby waves excited on the corrugated inner edge of the current\nWILD ET AL.: MIDNIGHT SECTOR AURORAL OMEGA BANDS A00I30A00I30\n18 of 20\nsheet [Jorgensen et al., 1999]. Although the observations\npresented in our study favor a process that generates\nearthward Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting flux in the plasma sheet (tail-\nward of geostationary orbit), it is unclear how an electron\u2010\naccelerating mechanism in the tail might result in stable,\nazimuthally propagating auroral features that migrate to the\nmorning\/dawn sector, unless the source in the tail also spanned\na range of local times. Further simultaneous, multipoint, in situ\nmeasurements are required to confidently validate or discount\nthe previously proposed mechanisms (e.g., at azimuthally\ndisplaced locations at the inner edge of the plasma sheet).\n5. Conclusions\n[65] This study presents space\u2010 and ground\u2010based ob-\nservations of a series of omega bands in the midnight sector\nauroral ionosphere just after midnight on 28 September\n2009. Specifically, this study exploited a ground\u2010based\nauroral all\u2010sky imager, magnetometer and coherent scatter\nhigh\u2010frequency radar to diagnose the electrodynamics of the\nauroral structures. Simultaneous upstream solar wind and\nIMF measurements were provided by the THEMIS C probe,\nand in situ field and plasma measurement from the tail\nplasma sheet were provided by the four Cluster satellites in\nmagnetic conjunction with the ground\u2010based experiments.\nThe results of the study can be summarized as follows.\n[66] 1. A train of at least five clear auroral omega bands\nwas observed, the first occurring within 5 min of a substorm\nexpansion phase intensification during an interval of steady\nsouthward and duskward oriented IMF and unremarkable\nsolar wind conditions (\u223c320 km s\u22121 Earthward speed and\n\u223c2.5 nPa dynamic pressure).\n[67] 2. The substorm onset and intensification occurred in\nthe immediate premidnight\/midnight sector (2300\u20132400MLT)\nwith the omega bands emerging in the immediate postmid-\nnight sector (\u223c0000\u20130030 MLT). The omega bands, which\nwere smaller (scale size \u223c200 km) than in many previous\nstudies [e.g., Akasofu, 1964; L\u00fchr, 1994; Wild et al., 2000],\npropagated eastward (dawnward) away from the onset region\nat \u223c400 m s\u22121 (i.e., at the lower end of eastward propagation\nspeeds reported by Opgenoorth et al. [1983] and Steen et al.\n[1988]).\n[68] 3. The optical auroral features were accompanied by\nPs6 magnetic pulsations, consistent with the passage of\nvortical ionospheric Hall currents associated with upward\/\ndownward field\u2010aligned currents over the magnetometer.\n[69] 4. There was no compelling evidence that the omega\nbands were associated with an ionospheric flow shear at the\npoleward boundary of the main auroral oval, but this cannot\nbe confirmed conclusively due to limited radar backscatter\nin the region poleward of the main oval. The average ion-\nospheric flow inside the main auroral oval was between\n100 and 250 m s\u22121 away from the radar throughout, con-\nsistent with dawnward flow in the dawn cell of the global\nionospheric convection pattern.\n[70] 5. The Cluster satellites, located in the tail plasma sheet\nobserved transient bursts of electron differential energy flux,\nincluding dispersed energy signatures, throughout the interval\nwhen omega bandswere observed in the vicinity of the satellite\nfootprints. During the conjunction, generally enhancedAlfv\u00e9nic\nPoynting flux was observed. Although variable in magnitude,\nthe field\u2010parallel Poynting flux was almost continuously\ndirected toward the Northern Hemisphere. Electron plasma\nmeasurements indicated that electrons with energies <3 keV\nwere accelerated in the field\u2010aligned direction.\n[71] 6. A one\u2010to\u2010one correlation between in situ plasma\nobservations and the auroral structures was not found, per-\nhaps due to limitations in the magnetospheric field model.\n[72] Our observations agree with previous studies sug-\ngesting that omega bands have a source mechanism in the\nplasma sheet, tailward of geostationary orbit. However, the\nsomewhat unusual magnetic local time of the structures\npresented here and their observation during the early sub-\nstorm expansion phase hints that these features may not be\nrestricted to the morning sector and the substorm recovery\nphase (as is often stated in the literature). This is consistent\nwith the findings of Connors et al. [2003], who reported that\nPs6 pulsations (considered to be the magnetic manifestation\nof auroral omega bands) can occur at or very near the time\nof onset of a substorm expansive phase, a pseudobreakup, or\na poleward boundary intensification.\n[73] We suggest that a survey of contemporary auroral\nimagery data sets (such as the archive of the North Ameri-\ncan THEMIS GBO network) may provide cradle\u2010to\u2010grave\nobservations of omega band formation at substorm onset\nnear the midnight sector and propagation over many hours\nof MLT into the late morning sector during the substorm\nrecovery phase. Such observations might suggest that the\ncommon generation mechanism for Ps6 pulsations and\nomega bands can be found during the substorm expansion\nphase, rather than the recovery phase.\n[74] Acknowledgments.
