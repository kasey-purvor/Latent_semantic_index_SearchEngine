INTRODUCTION\nThe possibility of high speed electronic devices using\nonly amorphous carbon \u0001a-C\u0002 with different fractions of sp3\nbonded carbon layers deposited by pulsed laser deposition\n\u0001PLD\u0002 was reported1 after many detailed studies.2\u20134 The\nmerit of PLD is that it is possible to tune the properties of the\nfilms, such as the sp3 fraction \u0001up to 80%\u201385%\u0002,5 by chang-\ning the laser fluence and the pressure of gas in the chamber.\nTo understand the growth mechanism, the dynamics of a\nconfined carbon plume ablated using a laser from a graphite\ntarget was studied using optical emission spectroscopy and\nultrafast charge-coupled device imaging.6 Amorphous carbon\nfilms deposited using PLD have been studied using electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy \u0001EELS\u0002 to provide information\nabout their sp2 fraction and their density7 with the degree of\nsp2 clustering obtained from Raman spectroscopy.8 The con-\ncentration and the chemical bonding in the films based on\nx-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have also been reported.9\nThe optical properties were studied using optical transmit-\ntance to give the optical bandgaps, and ellipsometry was\nused to obtain the refractive index. Electrical properties have\nbeen measured based on either sandwich or coplanar\nstructures.10,11\nLately, a Tauc\u2013Lorentz \u0001TL\u0002 model for spectroscopic el-\nlipsometer was developed and applied to a-C.12 It can pro-\nvide interpretation of the imaginary part of the dielectric con-\nstant which is related to the electron transitions between the\nvalence and the conduction bands, i.e., the electronic joint\ndensity of states \u0001JDOS\u0002 between the occupied valence band\nand the empty conduction band. Therefore, it is possible to\ncompare the electronic band structure with the data on the\nposition, strength, and broadening of the transition peak and\nthe Tauc optical bandgap, which are extracted from the\nJDOS between the valence and the conduction band. How-\never, there are few reports that connect the microstructural,\noptical, and electrical properties via the band structure. Typi-\ncally, Tauc \u0001Eo\u0002 and E04 optical bandgaps are measured in\norder to determine the optical bandgap \u0001Eopt\u0002 corresponding\nto the electron transition from \u0001 to \u0001\u0001 bands.13,14 However,\nwhen the electrical characterization is discussed, the size of\nthe electrical bandgap \u0001Eg\u0002 associated with the extended\nstates in the \u0002 and \u0002\u0001 bands is important.14\u201316 Here, we show\nthat particularly under high electric field conditions, the op-\ntical bandgap is a poor measure of the electrical gap, espe-\ncially when stress is present. It is important to understand the\nrelationship between these properties in order to visualize a\nbroader picture. The electronic density of states \u0001DOS\u0002 is\ninfluenced by the local and global stress present in the mi-\ncrostructure of the a-C films, which in turn influences the\nphysical optoelectronic and mechanical properties of the ma-\nterial. With a good knowledge on these relationships, it may\nbe possible to prepare a-C suitable as an electronic semicon-\nductor material.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA. Film deposition\na-C films were deposited using PLD on c-Si, mica, and\nquartz substrates in vacuum at a base pressure of\n\u000510\u22126 Torr, evacuated using a turbo molecular pump and\nbacked by a mechanical pump. Quartz and c-Si substrates\nwere cleaned using a series of organic solvents then rinsed\nwith de-ionized \u0001DI\u0002 water and dried using N2 gas. The\ndeposition on mica was carried out immediately after cleav-\ning.\nA KrF Lambda Physik excimer laser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002 operat-\ning at 248 nm with 25 ns full width at half maximum\n\u0001FWHM\u0002 pulse duration was used as the UV pulsed laser\na\u0002Electronic addresses: y.miyajima@surrey.ac.uk and s.silva@surrey.ac.uk.\nb\u0002Laboratoire de Physique des Interfaces et des Couches Minces, UMR 7647\nCNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, 91128 Palaiseau Cedex, France.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 105, 073521 \u00012009\u0002\n0021-8979\/2009\/105\u00027\u0001\/073521\/8\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics105, 073521-1\nDownloaded 21 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158.

The laser was incident through a quartz\nwindow and was focused onto the surface of a pyrolytic\ngraphite target \u0001Kurt. J. Lesker, 99.99% pure\u0002 with 10 cm\ndiameter, which was rotated during deposition to avoid abla-\ntion on the same spot. The surface of the target was cleaned\nusing laser ablation with the laser fluence of 4 J \/cm2 before\ndepositions. The repetition rate was fixed at 10 Hz for all\ndepositions. The laser fluence was varied between 4 and\n12 J \/cm2. Growth rates were deduced using an atomic force\nmicroscopy by measuring the height of a step created by a\nmask. The results are shown in Fig. 1.\nB. Electron energy loss spectroscopy\nThe sp2 content of a-C films was evaluated using\nEELS.17\u201320 The sp3 hybridized state forms bonding and an-\ntibonding \u0002 and \u0002\u0001 states, whereas the sp2 hybridized state\ncreates both \u0002 and \u0002\u0001 and \u0001 and \u0001\u0001 states. Therefore, the sp2\nfraction can be obtained from EELS using the peak corre-\nsponding to a transition from occupied 1s core electronic\nstates to empty \u0001\u0001 states in the carbon K edge spectra. This\ncarbon K edge is also the JDOS but between 1s core elec-\ntronic state and the conduction band. Here, the 1s core elec-\ntronic states can be treated as delta function; thus, this carbon\nK edge spectra are effectively the shape of the unoccupied\nconduction band. The area of the peak was modeled with a\nGaussian and normalized to the area under the spectrum\nfrom 283 to 294 eV and also to the normalized area of the \u0001\u0001\npeak of graphite as the standard of 100% sp2 bonded\ncarbon.21 The density of the film can be obtained from the\nplasmon peak in the low loss energy spectra, assuming that\nthere are four valence electrons per carbon atom.20\u201323\nTwo transmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002 systems\nwere used for the EELS measurements: a CM200 Philips\nSupertwin TEM \u0001LaB6 filament, Gatan Imaging Filter\nGIF2000 spectrometer\u0002 and a Hitachi STEM HD2300A\n\u0001Schottky field emission gun, Gatan Enfina spectrometer\u0002,\nboth operating at 200 kV. The a-C samples with a thickness\nbetween 30 and 70 nm were immersed in DI water and\nfloated off from mica substrates and then placed on copper\nTEM grids. As the sp2 fraction can be obtained using the\nEELS carbon K edge, the corresponding sp3 fraction can be\ndetermined by simple subtraction assuming that only sp2 and\nsp3 bond hybridizations are present in the sample. Due to the\nabsence of hydrogen it is unlikely that the films contain\nmany sp bonds.\nThe K edge and the low loss spectra are shown in Fig. 2\nand the sp3 fraction and the density of the films evaluated\nfrom these spectra are shown in Fig. 3.\nC. Raman spectroscopy\nVisible Raman spectroscopy using 514.5 nm excitation\n\u0001Renishaw Ramanscope\u0002 was used to obtain the microstruc-\ntural information, especially sp2 clustering.24\u201327 All the a-C\nfilms show similar Raman spectra consisting of only the G\npeak around 1580 cm\u22121 and almost no D peak around\n1350 cm\u22121. The second order TO peak of the Si substrate\ncan be observed at around 960 cm\u22121, as shown in Fig. 4. The\nG peak is attributed to the stretching mode of all sp2 carbon\nand the D peak is attributed to the breathing motion of\nsp2-aromatic rings, which are activated in disordered carbon\nwhen the graphene network is distorted.\nTypically, the Raman spectral data were fitted by Briet\u2013\nWigner\u2013Fano \u0001BWF\u000226,28 shape for the G peak and a Lorent-\nzian for the D peak.25 In this study, the Raman spectra of the\na-C films were fitted with only a BWF line shape as the sp3\nfraction of the film is quite high \u0001over 75%; see Fig. 3\u0002 and a\nclear D peak cannot be observed \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002.The BWF line\nshape is described using the equation shown below.\nI\u0001\u0003\u0002 =\nI0\u00031 + 2\u0001\u0003 \u2212 \u00030\u0002\/Q\u0004\u00042\n1 + \u00032\u0001\u0003 \u2212 \u00030\u0002\/\u0004\u0004\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere I0 is the intensity of the peak, \u0003 is the Raman shift, \u00030\nis the peak position, \u0004 is the FWHM of the peak, and Q is\nthe BWF coupling coefficient. The Lorentzian line shape is\nrecovered in the limit of Q\u21920. G peak position \u0003max is\nevaluated following the equation\nFIG. 1.

Here, the peak position of the G line is the\ncorrected position \u0003\u0003max \u0001Ref. 25\u0002\u0004 and when 1 \/Q becomes\nzero, the shape of the BWF line shape recovers to the Lorent-\nzian shape.\nD. Spectroscopic ellipsometry\nThe a-C films were studied with ex situ UV visible spec-\ntroscopic ellipsometry \u0001SE\u0002 in the range of photon energies\nfrom 1.5 to 5 eV using a UVISEL system from Jobin Yvon.\nFor the analysis, a TL analytical expression for the dielectric\nfunction12 was assumed. The SE provides the complex re-\nfractive index and allows the extraction of the Tauc optical\nbandgap \u0001Eo\u0002 and the energy at which the optical absorption\nis 104 cm\u22121 \u0001E04\u0002. Four parameters for the TL model \u0001A, C,\nEo, and Ee\u0002 are sufficient to describe the optical functions of\nthe thin film to the accuracy of the ellipsometer.\nJellison and Modine12 developed this model using the\nTauc JDOS and the Lorentz oscillator. The imaginary part \u0005i\nof the dielectric function is given by the product of the\nimaginary part of Tauc\u2019s dielectric function with that of Lor-\nentz. In the parabolic band approximation, Tauc\u2019s dielectric\nfunction describes interband transitions above the band edge.\nThe new expression for \u0005i is described by\n\u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002 = \u0006 AEeC\u0001h\u0006 \u2212 Eo\u00022\u0001\u0001h\u0006\u00022 \u2212 Ee2\u00022 + C2\u0001h\u0006\u00022 \u0007 1\u0001h\u0006\u0002\u0007 for h\u0006\n\b Eo, \u00013\u0002\n\u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002 = 0 for h\u0006 \t Eo, \u00014\u0002\nwhere A, the optical bandgap E0, C, and the peak transition\nenergy Ee are fitting parameters. In a single Lorentzian tran-\nsition, A and C take the significance of the height and\nFWHM of the transition peak. The fitting model is only valid\nin the measurement range of SE between 1.5 and 5 eV.\nAs the carbon K edge in EELS is a measure of the empty\nstates in the conduction band, we could deconvolute it from\nthe \u201cpure\u201d Lorentzian JDOS obtained using SE to obtain the\nvalence band DOS \u0001strictly speaking, the C K edge is the\nconvolution of 1s states with empty 2p states, but 1s is ef-\nfectively a delta function compared to 2p\u0002. This process is\ncurrently being investigated as it gets complicated by exci-\ntonic effects as well as the effect of the transition decay time.\nThe real part \u0005r of the dielectric function is derived from\nthe expression of \u0005i using the Kramers\u2013Kronig integration\nwith new parameter \u0005inf.\nFIG. 3. \u0001a\u0002 sp3 fraction, \u0001b\u0002 density of the films with different laser fluences,\nand \u0001c\u0002 density of the films with different sp3 fractions.\nFIG. 4.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nThe TL expression is consistent with known physical\nphenomena within the limitations of the model. At large h\u0006,\nthe \u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002 of the TL model tends to zero. This is consistent\nwith the observed behavior in the x-ray and \n-ray regimes,\nwhere it is known that the absorption coefficient is very\nsmall. Furthermore, \u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002=0 below Eo. Mechanisms that\ngive a nonzero value of \u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002 below the bandgap are explic-\nitly ignored in the TL model such as Urbach tail absorption\nand vibrational absorption in the infrared.12 Finally, the TL\nexpression is Kramers\u2013Kronig consistent in that \u0005r\u0001h\u0006\u0002 is\ndetermined by Kramers\u2013Kronig integration. The dispersion\nof the refractive index n\u0001h\u0006\u0002 and the extinction coefficient\nk\u0001h\u0006\u0002 are evaluated from \u0005r\u0001h\u0006\u0002 and \u0005i\u0001h\u0006\u0002. It should be\nnoted that the a-C film was fitted using the above models\nwith void due to the inhomogeneity of the film.\nFigures 6 and 7 show the fitted parameters of the TL\nmodel as well as the refractive index \u0001n\u0002 and the extinction\ncoefficient \u0001k\u0002 dispersions, respectively. The refractive index\nat 2 eV, which is the energy that is normally used for mono-\nchromatic light source ellipsometry, is shown in Fig. 11.\nE. UV-visible-NIR optical transmittance\nA Varian Cary 500, UV-visible-NIR spectrometer was\nused in dual beam mode for the optical transmittance be-\ntween 190 and 3000 nm \u00016.5\u22120.4 eV\u0002. Amorphous carbon\nfilms with a thickness of around 30 nm on quartz substrates\nwere used. The transmittance was converted to the absor-\nbance coefficient \u000b\u0003cm\u22121\u0004 to get the optical bandgap E04 that\ncorresponds to the photon energy at the absorption coeffi-\ncient of 104 cm\u22121. The Tauc optical bandgap was also evalu-\nated using a Tauc plot of \u0001\u000bhv\u00021\/2 versus photon energy \u0001hv\u0002\n\u0001Ref. 29\u0002 and the procedure can be found elsewhere.30\nThe optical bandgap \u0001E04 evaluated using UV-visible-\nNIR optical transmittance and Tauc gap evaluated using both\nUV-visible-NIR optical transmittance and SE\u0002 is shown in\nFig. 11\u0001a\u0002.\nF.

After a-C deposition with a thickness of around 30\nnm using PLD, a 1.5\u000710\u22124 mm2 circular shape top elec-\ntrode was fabricated using a shadow mask. The top electrode\nwas dc sputtered and composed of 50 nm of Cr coated with\n50 nm of Au. Electrical measurements were carried out using\na Keithley 236 source meter with a temperature controlled\nstage that varied between 21 and 80 \u00b0C in order to determine\nthe activation energy. The J-E characteristics and the square\nroot dependence of the activation energy Ea with electric\nfield are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe growth rate of the film increases with increasing\nlaser fluence, as shown in Fig. 1, and is similar to reports\npublished elsewhere.31 The higher fluence laser ablates more\natoms\/ions with higher speed from the graphite to the sub-\nstrate. Henley et al.6 showed that in vacuum, the ablated\ncarbon forms a plume with a speed that reaches 8 km\/s, 400\nns after the laser ablation with a laser fluence of 10 J \/cm2.\nAt the pressure range in this study \u0001\f10\u22125 Torr\u0002, the mol-\necules inside the chamber should not affect the film proper-\nties significantly as the mean free path in the vacuum is\nmuch longer \u0001\b5 m\u0002 than the target-substrate distance \u00016\ncm\u0002.32 Thus, on average a few collisions between carbon\natoms\/ions and the gas molecules are expected while the film\nforming species transports itself between the target and the\nsubstrate, and the carbon plume is thought to reach the sub-\nstrates without significant loss in momentum. Such high mo-\nmentum of carbon ions and atoms is thought to form sp3\nhybridized carbon atoms on impact with the growing film\nand gives higher stress through metastable bond formation in\nthe a-C films.\nThe analysis of the change in the EELS carbon K edge\nand the shift in the plasmon peak energy in low loss spectra\nenable microstructural information to be extracted such as\nthe sp3 fraction and the density of the film, as shown in Figs.\n2 and 3. The gradual increase in the sp3 fraction and the\ndensity of the films with increasing laser fluence is thought\nto be the consequence of ballistic transport of carbon species\nfrom the target to the substrate. A higher speed carbon plume\nhas a higher energy which can form higher fractions of sp3\nbonding and denser films due to impact densification,\nwhether direct or indirect, as observed in dual magnetron\nsputtering with ion plating.24 Figure 3\u0001c\u0002 shows that the den-\nsity reaches almost 2.8 g \/cm3 when the sp3 fraction exceeds\n80%.\nRaman spectra show almost no D peak; therefore the\nintensity ratio of the D and G peaks, I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002, is almost\nzero. This indicates that the sp2 clustering in the film is low,\nand such films can be classified as tetrahedral amorphous\ncarbon \u0001ta-C\u0002, as reported elsewhere.25 However, the samples\ndeposited with the laser fluence of 6 and 8 J \/cm2 might\nhave a small D peak contribution. The results of curve fitting\nto the Raman spectrum, the change in the growth rate, the\nsp3 fraction, and the density of the film show dispersion\naround these laser fluences. It might suggest microstructural\nchange occurring in this regime just before the sp3 fraction\nreaches 80%. After this point it can be thought that the sp2\nclusters are almost completely separated by the sp3 matrix.\nIn such a structure, internal stress is thought to be high since\nsp2 clusters contribute less to compressive stress associated\nwith a-C films.\nThe TL model with SE fitted parameters is shown in Fig.\n6. The dielectric constant in the high energy region \u0001\u0005inf\u0002 is\nan additional fitting parameter that prevents the imaginary\nFIG. 8. \u0001a\u0002 J-E characteristics and \u0001b\u0002 PF plot of devices deposited at vari-\nous laser fluences.

Four parameters describe\nthe imaginary part of the dielectric function. A \u0001eV\u0002 is related\nto the strength of the absorption peak, whereas C is the\ndamping coefficient linked to the FWHM of the absorption\npeak. In general, the FWHM of the peak increases with in-\ncreasing peak strength \u0003Figs. 6\u0001b\u0002 and 6\u0001d\u0002\u0004. The energy of\nthe maximum transition probability and the Tauc optical\nbandgap are described by Ee \u0001eV\u0002 and Eo \u0001eV\u0002, and Ee is\nalways higher than Eo as expected.\nEo increases up to a fluence of around 6 J \/cm2 and then\ndecreases with subsequently increasing fluence. This follows\nthe major structural change induced by stress in the films\nhaving a high sp3 fraction which are metastable. C seems to\nbe unchanged apart from 6 and 8 J \/cm2. Ee changes rapidly\nfrom 4 to 6 J \/cm2 then gradually increases. A increases with\nincreasing laser power.\nIt should be pointed out that these four parameters de-\nscribe the imaginary part of the dielectric function which\nreflects the electronic JDOS between the valence band and\nthe conduction band. The valence band consists of \u0002 and \u0001\nbands, whereas the empty conduction band consists of \u0002\u0001\nand \u0001\u0001 bands. \u0002 and \u0002\u0001 bands are attributed to sp3 hybrid-\nized carbon, whereas \u0001 and \u0001\u0001 bands are attributed to the sp2\nhybridized carbon. The \u0001 and \u0001\u0001 bands are closer to the\nFermi level compared with \u0002 and \u0002\u0001; therefore, the increase\nin Ee and A can be attributed to the increase in the sp3 frac-\ntion as measured by EELS. The rapid increase around\n6 J \/cm2 may again indicate a structural change. The broad-\nening factor C for 6 and 8 J \/cm2 is higher than the other\nsamples, which could be attributed to the slight sp2 cluster-\ning that can be seen in the Raman spectra. The value of Eo\nand its change with increasing laser energy are against the\ngeneral trend of the optical bandgap3,13 which shows that\nfilms with a higher sp3 fraction have a higher optical band-\ngap since the contribution of the \u0001 and \u0001\u0001 bands becomes\nsmaller.\nHowever, there are some reports on nonhydrogenated\namorphous carbon films which have a high sp3 fraction and a\nlow optical bandgap.24,33 When Ar assisted sputtering is used\nto deposit high sp3 fraction films, there is a peak energy of\nAr ions which gives films that are denser and have high\nstress. There is a stress induced sp2 to sp3 transformation\nover 13 GPa; thus the sp3 fraction can reach above 60%. The\nlow optical bandgap was attributed to the small sp2 clusters\nin the film which were observed by TEM. The origin of the\nlow optical bandgap was attributed to the high stress in the\nsputtered films and the oriented sp2 bonding, as recently ob-\nserved in ta-C films deposited by filtered vacuum cathodic\narc . Actually, the stress of the PLD a-C films used in this\nstudy, especially at higher laser fluence films is high. This\nwas supported by the fact that films with thickness above\n\u000550 nm tend to delaminate.\nA stress value of 5 GPa has now been calculated, which\nis based on the difference in the residual stress of the film\nand estimated from the shift in the G-peak position in the\nRaman spectrum.34 The value calculated is of the order ex-\npected in these metastable thin films and adds further\nstrength to the arguments we have made of the importance of\nthe local atomic arrangements to the macroscopic properties\nof the film.\nThe dispersion of n and k depends on the laser fluence,\nas shown in Fig. 7. These are evaluated from the real and the\nimaginary parts of dielectric constant. At low photon energy,\nn decreases from \u00053.1 to 2.6 with increasing laser fluences,\nand the curves then become almost linear before n increases\nto around 2.8. The dispersion of k is almost the same for all\nsamples apart from 4 J \/cm2. Higher value of k on the film\ndeposited at 4 J \/cm2 can be attributed to the microstructure\nof the film since it has the highest sp2 fraction in this study.\nThe J-E characteristics measured using the sandwich\nstructures are shown in Fig. 8\u0001a\u0002. The conduction mechanism\nwas found to be Poole\u2013Frenkel \u0001PF\u0002 conduction at high elec-\ntric fields \u0001\b104 V \/cm\u0002 as the log of the current density J is\nproportional to the square root of the electric field, as shown\nin Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002. The J-E characteristics are symmetric despite\nthe contact materials being different \u0001n++Si for the bottom\nand Cr for the top contacts\u0002,35 which shows that the current is\nlimited by conduction through the bulk of the film.\nIf the conduction mechanism follows the PF model, the\ncurrent density \u0001J\u0002 for this situation is given by35,36\nJ = eN\r\u0001E exp\b\u2212 \u0001\u000e \u2212 \u0001\u000fPF\/\n\u0002\tE\u0002kT \n , \u00015\u0002\nwhere\n\u000fPF =\t e3\n\u0001\u0005r\u00050\n. \u00016\u0002\nHere, \u000e is the depth of the neutral trapping centers, E is the\nelectric field across the film, N is the density of the trapping\ncanters, \r is the effective mobility, and \n is the coefficient\nthat changes from one to two depending on the concentration\nof defects and the degree of compensation.36,37 When \n=1,\nthis equation is identical to the classical PF equation. The\ndielectric constant of the film can be determined from the PF\ncoefficient given by Eq. \u00016\u0002. The activation energy \u0001Ea\u0002 for\nthe conduction process at a given field can be obtained from\nEq. \u00015\u0002 by measuring current density over a range of tem-\nperature. The only unknown is then the product of trap con-\ncentration and mobility \u0001N\r\u0001\u0002.\nIt was also shown that the activation energy is propor-\ntional to the square root of the electric field at high fields, as\nshown in Fig. 9, which is a further indication that PF con-\nduction via neutral localized states is the dominant conduc-\ntion mechanism at high electric fields. From these plots, the\ndepth of the neutral trapping centers was calculated to be\n0.21 and 0.42 eV for 4 and 6 J \/cm2 samples, respectively.\nThere is also a possibility that PF-type conduction might go\nthrough two or more localized states instead of the edge of\nthe conduction bands.38\nThe dielectric constants were evaluated using the PF plot\nand compared with the square of n at 2 eV, as shown in Fig.\n10\u0001a\u0002. There is a remarkably good agreement in view of all\nthe approximations made. The dielectric constant at high fre-\nquency and the conductivity at low fields are shown in Figs.\n10\u0001b\u0002 and 10\u0001c\u0002, respectively. The dielectric constant gives\n073521-6 Miyajima et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105, 073521 \u00022009\u0001\nDownloaded 21 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nthe magnitude of the electrostatic attraction between charged\ncenters and carriers and also between opposite charged car-\nriers \u0001electrons and holes\u0002. The increase in the dielectric con-\nstant reduces the distance at which a charge carrier becomes\nfree from an oppositely charged center.39 Thus, there is a\ncorrelation between \u0005inf and the conductivity, as shown in\nFigs. 10\u0001b\u0002 and 10\u0001c\u0002. The dielectric constant n was extracted\nusing the TL model for SE which gives a better correlation\nbetween n, evaluated from PF plots, compared with a former\nreport that used monochromatic ellipsometry.35 This is par-\nticularly true for the sample deposited at 4 J \/cm2. This\nsample also shows the highest conductivity; thus the highest\nsp2 fraction could affect the conductivity at low fields via\nconduction through the sp2 network.\nFigure 11\u0001a\u0002 shows the optical bandgaps evaluated from\nUV-visible-NIR and SE. Both the SE and the optical trans-\nmittance measurements give an optical bandgap \f1 eV\neven when the sp3 fraction is more than 70%. In general,\nhigher sp3 fraction films have higher optical bandgaps since\nthe contribution of \u0002\u0001 and \u0002 is larger. The different optical\nbandgap obtained by optical transmittance and SE at high\nlaser fluences could be due to the fact that SE takes into\naccount the reflections of the films, whereas the optical trans-\nmittance does not. The other possibility is that these films\nwere very absorbing and a long Urbach tail is present, which\nis reflected in the low optical bandgap. The Tauc gap from an\noptical transmittance measurement was obtained from the\nTauc plot, whereas the Tauc gap from SE is obtained as a\nfitting parameter to a range of energies. As SE does not take\ninto account the Urbach tail in the infrared region, when the\nfilms have a large contribution from stress induced electronic\nlocalized states in the low energy region, SE would probably\nprovide a smaller gap. UV-visible-NIR optical transmittance\ngives the optical bandgap, but this may have little correlation\nwith the electrical gap, especially for high fields.\nThe activation energy evaluated at low fields and the\nrefractive index at 2 eV are also shown in Figs. 11\u0001b\u0002 and\n11\u0001c\u0002, respectively. Here, the electric field is less than\n104 V \/cm and the J-E characteristic is linear. As it has al-\nready been stated, the conduction mechanism at high fields\nwas confirmed to be PF bulk limited conduction. It means\nthat the conduction band might contribute to the conduction\nonly under high electric fields. The possible conduction\nmechanism for low electric fields is thought to be dominated\nby band tail hopping,40 which occurs via defects in the band\ntail above the Fermi level. In such a case, the activation\nenergy is an indication of the energy between the defects and\nthe Fermi level. Such defects are thought to be at the bottom\nof the empty electronic localized \u0001\u0001 band or stress induced\nelectronic localized states close to the Fermi level. Therefore,\nthe very low activation energies at high laser fluence can be\nexplained by a high density of stress and disorder induced\ndefects.\nIt is important to point out that stress induced electronic\nstates might be attributed to the \u201cweak bonds\u201d formed by \u0001\nand \u0001\u0001 bonds.41,42 The deposition condition defines the mi-\ncrostructure of the films such as sp3 ratio and the internal\nstress. When the sp3 ratio and the internal stress are high,\nsmall sp2 clusters are thought to exist, and some of the \u0001 and\n\u0001\u0001 bonds might be the weak bonds. If so, such weak bonds\ncreate the electronic localized states in the midgap; conse-\nquently the optical bandgap of such a-C films decreases.\nSuch electronic localized states can be thought to contribute\nto the electrical conduction as defects or neutral defects, and\nFIG. 10. \u0001a\u0002 Dielectric constant evaluated from PF plot and n2 \u0001at 2 eV\u0002\nevaluated from SE. \u0001b\u0002 The dielectric constant at high energy \u0001x-ray and\n\n-ray regions\u0002 which is used for SE fitting and \u0001c\u0002 the conductivity evaluated\nfrom low electric fields.\nFIG. 11. \u0001a\u0002 The optical bandgap \u0001E04 and Tauc from UV-visible-NIR and\nSE\u0002, \u0001b\u0002 the activation energy measured at low electric fields, and \u0001c\u0002 the\nrefractive index n at 2 eV for different laser fluences.\n073521-7 Miyajima et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nlaser annealing on PLD deposited a-C supports this\nconcept.43 Then, there is a possibility that the PF bulk limited\nconduction occurs through such electronic localized states or\nbands in the midgap formed by weak bonds.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe microstructural, optical, and electrical properties of\npulsed laser deposited a-C films containing a high fraction of\nsp3 bonds were analyzed using optical and electrical mea-\nsurements. The TL model for SE gives a better understanding\nof optical properties than monochromatic ellipsometry with\nthe parameters showing good correlation with measurements\nsuch as the electrical EELS and Raman.\nThese measurements show high sp3 fractions but a low\noptical bandgap for PLD ta-C films. This low optical band-\ngap is attributed to the high sp3 induced electronic localized\nstates in the gap via stress. The major microstructural change\nappears to occur when the sp3 fraction of the film exceeds\n80%. In such a region, the optical bandgaps evaluated from\nUV-visible-NIR and SE are different. This is attributed to the\npresence of Urbach tail-like stress induced electronic local-\nized states due to the disorder and weak bonds.\nThe electrical conduction mechanism at low electric\nfields seems to be dominated by band tail hopping via stress\ninduced electronic localized states close to the Fermi level at\nthe bottom of the localized \u0001\u0001 band. When high electric\nfields are applied, the conduction band can contribute to the\nconduction via a PF conduction.\nStress, disorder, and weak bonds are related to laser flu-\nence and the energy of the carbon incident on the substrate.\nThe use of lower laser power and an ambient gas to reduce\nthe energy of the carbon reduces stress but also lowers the\nsp3 fraction and therefore the optical bandgap. To fabricate a\nnanoelectronic device such as resonant tunneling diodes that\noperate in the high field region improvements to the quality\nof the material will need to be made.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC, U.K. for funding\nthis program via a Portfolio Partnership award.\n1S.
