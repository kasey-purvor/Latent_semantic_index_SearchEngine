The\nprimary goal of these initiatives is to encourage older people to be active and\nproductive, and to enhance quality of life, health and wellbeing. It is well known\nthat with increasing age, night-time sleep deteriorates, which has implications for\nhow older people maintain activity levels, and leads to an increased propensity for\nday-time sleep. Using data from 62 interviews with people aged 65\u201395 years living\nin their own homes who reported poor sleep, this paper explores the meanings\nof day-time sleep, and how the attitudes and practices of \u2018active ageing\u2019 are\nintricately linked to the management of day-time sleep and bodily changes that\narise from the ageing process. The desire to be active in later life led to primarily\ndichotomous attitudes to day-time sleep; older people either chose to accept\nsleeping in the day, or resisted it. Those who accepted day-time sleep did so\nbecause of recognition of decreasing energy in later life, and an acknowledgement\nthat napping is bene\ufb01cial in helping to maintain active lives. Those who resisted\nday-time sleep did so because time spent napping was regarded as being both\nunproductive and as a negative marker of the ageing process.\nKEY WORDS \u2013 active ageing, activity, napping, sleep, acceptance, resistance.\nIntroduction\n\u2018Active ageing\u2019, and its link to wellbeing, independence and health, are\nnow regularly promoted through both policy and practice (Department of\nHealth 2005; Department for Work and Pensions 2005; World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) 2002) and through research funding initiatives such\nas the United Kingdom Research Councils\u2019 New Dynamics of Ageing\nprogramme (Clarke and Warren 2007; Hennessey and Walker 2011).\n\u2018Active ageing\u2019 as a concept developed from established gerontological\ntheories such as disengagement theory (Cumming and Henry 1961) and\nstructured dependency theory (Townsend 1981), both of which focused on\n* Centre for Research on Gender and Ageing (CRAG), University of Surrey, Guildford,\nUK.\nAgeing & Society 31, 2011, 197\u2013216. f Cambridge University Press 2010 197\ndoi:10.1017\/S0144686X10000954\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nthe social structures that constrain and isolate older people (Gilleard and\nHiggs 1998), and from activity theory (Havighurst 1963).\nActivity theory, in contrast, emphasised the in\ufb02uence of constraining\nforces on later life by putting a greater emphasis on individual agency,\ncontinuing through retirement into a productive, active and healthy\nold age (Clarke and Warren 2007; Katz 2005; Walker 2002). It has been\ncriticised, however, for placing unrealistic pressure on older people to\ncontinue the activity levels of middle age through to old age, without\nrecognising the implications of bodily changes in later life, as well as failing\nto address potential barriers to active ageing, such as limited access to\nhealth care and appropriate housing (Estes 1982; Katz 2005; Walker\n2006). The emergence of the new concept of \u2018active ageing\u2019 in the\n1990s, developed through the WHO and other governmental and non-\ngovernmental organisation initiatives, o\ufb00ered a policy framework which\nemphasised the link between activity, health, independence and successful\nageing: \u2018active ageing is the process of optimizing opportunities for health,\nparticipation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age\u2019\n(WHO 2002: 12; see also Walker 2002).\nThe goal of \u2018active ageing\u2019 is to empower older people to be active and\nindependent in later life, and to avoid the morally negative implications of\nageing and dependency in old age (Katz 2005). To be successful in later life\nis seen as linking ageing with activity, productivity and health, so that to\nfail to be active and productive in retirement is to age unsuccessfully\n(Bowling 1993; Katz 2005). Jolanki, whose respondents were all aged 90 or\nmore years, found that their narratives of physical and social activity, or\n\u2018activity talk \u2019, were closely linked to perceptions of what constitutes good\nhealth, and that \u2018being active in all imaginable ways was clearly the\npreferable option\u2019 (2009: 263). Notwithstanding those older people who\nare frail or disabled and with limited capacity to undertake physical\nactivities, the premise of \u2018active ageing\u2019 assumes that older people have\nthe capacity to be active and productive in later life (Bowling 2008;\nWalker 2002). Yet there is also a need to acknowledge that some bodily\nchanges that accompany ageing, such as poor night-time sleep, impact on\nenergy levels during the day and therefore constrain the number and\nduration of activities that older people can comfortably undertake.\nMoreover, the link between moderate physical activity and improved\nquality of sleep has been established (King et al. 1997), as have the e\ufb00ects of\nmaintaining leisure and domestic activities in later life in mediating against\ninsomnia in older people (Morgan 2003).\nIf the goal in later life is to be \u2018busy\u2019 and active, how do older people\nwith poor night-time sleep reconcile the desire to remain active with the\n(occasional) need to sleep during the day? It is well known that sleep in\n198 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nlater life is often compromised as a result of a change in the architecture of\nsleep with increasing age (Feinsilver 2003; Morgan 1998; Ohayon and\nVecchierini 2005). For example, time spent in deep, slow-wave, sleep\ndiminishes with age, and the time spent in lighter sleep increases, leaving\nolder people \ufb01nding that it takes longer to get to sleep, have more frag-\nmented sleep episodes and wake up earlier (Ancoli-Israel, Ayalon and\nSalzman 2008). Total night-time sleep for older people is often reduced,\ntherefore, which may ultimately lead to a propensity to nap and doze\nduring the day and evening (McCrae et al. 2006; Youn et al. 2003). There\nhas been research into whether day-time napping bene\ufb01ts older people by\nincreasing their overall time spent asleep during 24 hours (Campbell,\nMurphy and Stauble 2005) or is detrimental in terms of reducing the\nquality and duration of night-time sleep (Boden-Albala et al. 2008).\nDespite the known deterioration in night-time sleep with ageing, and\nthe greater likelihood of day-time sleeping amongst older people, little\nattention has been paid to the meaning of day-time sleep in later life. For\nexample, sleep researchers have largely conceptualised day-time sleep as\n\u2018napping\u2019 without recognising the potential inappropriateness of using the\nterm \u2018to nap\u2019 as a representation of day-time sleep for older people. The\nimplicit meaning of the word \u2018nap\u2019 is not only that it takes place during\nthe day, but that it is sleep that is intentional, controlled, planned for, and\nclearly delineated with a beginning and an end, as in the expression \u2018 to\ntake a nap\u2019. \u2018Power\u2019 napping, for example, is recommended for o\ufb03ce\nworkers to improve productivity (Pilcher, Michalowski and Carrigan\n2001) ; a siesta is the (acceptable) cultural equivalent of a nap in\nMediterranean countries, and inemuri or napping during work or school in\nJapan is acceptable because of its implication that an employee is working\nhard (Williams 2005, 2007). Napping, then, has di\ufb00erent connotations\nfor di\ufb00erent groups of people. Most studies of napping among older\npeople have asked only whether the older person said they did or did not\nnap, and few have recognised that day-time sleep may be unintentional\n(Ficca et al. 2009). In addition, older people tend to under-report day-time\nsleep, most particularly evening sleep or dozing (Dautovich, McCrae and\nRowe 2008).\nSociological investigations of the social context of sleep have shown that\na range of social factors in\ufb02uence night-time sleep and sleep disturbances.\nThese studies have focused variously on midlife women (Hislop and Arber\n2003), on couples and sleep (Meadows 2005; Meadows et al. 2008a, 2008b ;\nVenn 2007; Venn et al. 2008) and on children and sleep (Venn and Arber\n2008). A recent study has examined older people\u2019s sleep (Venn and Arber\n2009), but no other sociological work has examined the signi\ufb01cance of\nday-time sleep for older people, in spite of its acknowledged prevalence in\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 199\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nlater life (Martin and Ancoli-Israel 2006). Because of its high prevalence,\nnapping was included in a list of daily activities undertaken by older people\nin Arbuckle et al.\u2019s (1994) study of predictors of cognitive functioning, but it\nwas treated as a passive (non) activity without considering whether older\npeople themselves regarded day-time sleep as an activity, or as a preventer of\nactivity. The aims of this paper are : (a) to contribute to our understanding\nof the meanings and experiences of day-time sleep in the lives of older\npeople, (b) to examine whether older people accept or resist sleeping\nduring the day and the factors that underlie their orientations to day-time\nsleep, and (c) to examine how day-time sleep is linked to attitudes about\nand the practice of \u2018active ageing\u2019 among older people.\nMethods\nThe data presented in this paper come from a large multi-disciplinary\ninvestigation of poor sleep in later life that was funded through the United\nKingdom Research Councils\u2019 New Dynamics of Ageing programme. This\npart of the project aimed to understand the meanings and experiences of\npoor sleep for older people living in the community and the strategies they\nused to help with poor sleep. Data collection was undertaken in two\nphases. Phase 1 sent 2,400 self-completion questionnaires to a strati\ufb01ed\nsample of community-dwelling older people in the Thames Valley area of\nsouthern England. The sample was drawn from the registered patients\nof ten general medical practices, and equally divided by gender and into\ntwo age groups (65\u201374 and 75+ years). The questionnaire had two parts :\n(a) the modi\ufb01ed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al. 1998),\nwhich asks questions about sleep quality, duration and fragmentation\nduring the previous month, and (b) questions about age, employment,\nhealth and marital status. Of the 1,158 respondents, over one-half were\nidenti\ufb01ed as having poor sleep, that is a PSQI score of at least \u20185 \u2019 (Venn\nand Arber 2009).\nA sub-sample of 62 of these \u2018poor sleepers \u2019, strati\ufb01ed by gender, age\ngroup and partnership status, were invited to take part in Phase 2, which\ncomprised an in-depth semi-structured interview lasting between one and\nthree hours in the respondent\u2019s own home. The sub-sample contained\n31 men and 31 women, and their ages ranged from 65 to 95 years. The\n39 who consented to have extracts of their interview appear on the\nHealthtalkonline website (www.healthtalkonline.org) were video and\/or\naudio-recorded, and all the other interviews were audio-recorded. The\nwebsite has \u2018modules \u2019 of people talking about their personal experiences\nof health and illness, and the interview extracts were used to create a\n200 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nmodule called \u2018Sleep Problems in Later Life \u2019 (see http:\/\/www.\nhealthtalkonline.org\/Later_life\/Sleep_problems_in_later_life). All par-\nticipants received an honorarium in compensation for their time, and\ncon\ufb01dentiality and anonymity were assured. Pseudonyms are used to\nprotect their anonymity, and identi\ufb01ers are kept to marital status and age.\nEthical approval was granted by a National Health Service Multicentre\nResearch Ethics Committee and the University of Surrey Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nWhilst an interview topic guide was used as a framework to ensure\nconsistency across all interviews, respondents were encouraged to talk\nfreely and openly (Patton 2002). Questions during the interview focused on\nasking participants about perceptions of their sleep and sleep quality, sleep\nhistory, sleeping behaviours and environment, and attitudes to sleep and\nsleep disruption. During the pilots of the interview guide, it was realised\nthat how older people talked about day-time sleep re\ufb02ected the di\ufb00erent\nconnotations they placed on sleeping during the day. Further probing\nquestions were devised to include discussion of all occurrences of day-time\nand evening sleep. All interviews were recorded and fully transcribed, and\nanalysis was undertaken using NVivo8. Emerging themes were identi\ufb01ed\nby reviewing respondents\u2019 answers to questions pertaining to day-time\nsleep and daily activities.\nAccepting or resisting day-time sleep: implications for active ageing\nAll but \ufb01ve of the 62 participants indicated that sometimes they had some\nform of day-time sleep, which varied in frequency, duration and type\n(e.g. napping, dozing, nodding o\ufb00, and cat-napping) from \u2018very rarely \u2019 to\n\u2018routinely two to three times a day\u2019. Rather than the frequency, the main\nfocus of this paper is the participants\u2019 perceptions of the implications that\nday-time sleep had in terms of undertaking and achieving daily activities in\nlater life.\nOlder peoples\u2019 attitudes to day-time sleep were divided, in that most\neither accepted or resisted it. Somewhat paradoxically, the reasons given\nfor accepting or resisting day-time sleep were much the same, in that day-\ntime sleep was regarded as closely linked to being active and therefore\nproductive and as part of getting older. Those who accepted day-time\nsleep (26 of 62) did so in order that they had su\ufb03cient energy to be able to\ncontinue with their daily activities, as well as acknowledging that napping\nwas an inevitable signi\ufb01er of the ageing process. The implicit meaning of\nnapping is a planned day-time sleep, sometimes taken in bed, sometimes\nby lying down on a sofa or sitting in a chair. When napping was accepted\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 201\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nand planned for by the poor sleepers, it was most often described as\n\u2018 taking a nap\u2019 or \u2018nodding o\ufb00\u2019. As Ficca et al. (2009) pointed out, however,\nday-time sleep may not only be planned napping, but can include un-\nintentional napping or dozing and is often under-reported, particularly by\nolder people. Many of those who accepted napping during the day also\ndescribed circumstances, or speci\ufb01c times of the day, when they expected\nto fall asleep, such as in a warm room following morning exercise, or\nwhilst watching the television news after lunch. In these circumstances,\nday-time sleep may be classed as a \u2018nap\u2019 but may also be acknowledged as\na \u2018doze\u2019, as exempli\ufb01ed by the following exchange with 72-year-old\nJosephine (all names are pseudonyms) :\nInterviewer : If you had a day when you had nothing planned, would you say\n\u2018I am tired and I am aware that I need to have a nap\u2019?\nJosephine: No, I might say \u2018I will sit down and see what is on television\u2019. Then\nI will have a nap \u2026 an involuntary one.\nThose who resisted day-time sleep (31 out of 62) mainly did so because of\nthe negative moral connotations of wasting potentially productive time\nduring the day. Sleeping during the day was not seen as an activity, but\nrather as a way of preventing activity and was therefore to be avoided. As\nwith those who accepted day-time sleep, napping was regarded as one of\nthe signi\ufb01ers of ageing and the ageing process, but they saw ageing itself as\nto be resisted, along with any markers of ageing, such as napping. Day-\ntime sleep was therefore not spoken of as a \u2018nap\u2019 because of what was\nimplied by napping, but may have been reluctantly acknowledged as a\n\u2018doze\u2019 or \u2018dozing o\ufb00\u2019. The implication is that dozing is not really sleeping,\nand suggests that the dozer is not completely relinquishing control and\nattachment to the waking world. Dozing implies retaining some level of\nconsciousness and allows for the possibility of quickly resuming activity.\nTable 1 illustrates the characteristics of the older people who accepted\nor resisted napping by gender and whether they lived with a partner.\nT A B L E 1.

In terms of gender, slightly more\nwomen than men were likely to resist napping, perhaps as a result of the\ngendered expectations of women\u2019s domestic roles in the household and the\nneed to be continuously productive, and slightly more of those living with\na partner resisted day-time sleep. As Shirley (aged 72 years) commented, it\nis inappropriate when there is a couple for one person to nap whilst the\nother remains active :\nInterviewer : So you won\u2019t have an afternoon nap for example?\nShirley : Never !\nInterviewer : Okay, why do you say it so vehemently? I\u2019m interested.\nShirley : I suppose if I think about it, it might be the reason I get narked with\nmy husband if he does it. I just see it as unnecessary to have to sleep\nso much I think.\nMaintaining an active lifestyle in later life was regarded as very important\nby all the participants. They placed great emphasis on the desirability of\nphysical exercise, such as walking, swimming or cycling, of leisure activi-\nties, such as socialising and attending clubs or church; and of mental\nactivities, such as learning how to use the computer and reading. Although\nthe respondents acknowledged that activity levels had diminished to a\ndegree in later life, and adjustments therefore had to be made to their\ntype and amount, being active was universally regarded as desirable and\neven essential. Framed within the imperative to keep \u2018busy\u2019 and active\nin later life, the reasons for acceptance of day-time sleep will \ufb01rst be\ndiscussed, and then we will examine the views of those who resisted day-\ntime sleep.\nAcceptance of day-time sleep\nThe respondents who accepted day-time sleep reported that their ability to\nundertake daily routines and activities was adversely a\ufb00ected by poor\nnight-time sleep, so that having a nap, or dozing o\ufb00 during the day-time or\nearly evening, were seen as valuable in terms of being able to maintain\ntheir desired activity levels. Additionally, deteriorating night-time sleep,\nwhich led to day-time sleep, was seen as an inevitable and acceptable part\nof getting older.\nAccepting day-time sleep : being active, being productive\nFor people in paid employment, the link between achieving a good night\u2019s\nsleep and being productive the next day at work is clear and unambiguous.\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 203\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nMeadows et al.\u2019s (2008a) study of couples\u2019 sleep found that men linked the\nneed for a good night\u2019s sleep with their ability to function the following\nday, recognising that without a \u2018good night\u2019s sleep\u2019, work the next day was\nmore di\ufb03cult. Similarly among our respondents with poor sleep, those\nwho accepted day-time sleep linked the need to nap, or justi\ufb01ed un-\nplanned napping, with the desire to have su\ufb03cient energy to undertake\nhousehold jobs or tasks. For the few who were still working, and for those\nwho had regularly taken a nap during the working day prior to retirement,\nnapping was not only seen as acceptable, but also a justi\ufb01ed necessity.\nHaving a nap was seen as a way of continuing to be able to function\nproperly at work, or to get on with household chores after work. This was\nexpressed well by Jenny, who lived with a partner, was aged 69 years, and\nworked part-time as a care worker. She often took a nap after work and\nbefore her household tasks :\nIf I\u2019m really tired, I\u2019ll just get into bed, otherwise I\u2019ll just sit here and nod o\ufb00 for\nsometimes an hour, and that\u2019s all I need, and I feel so much better and then I can\ncarry on and cook dinner and all that sort of thing.\nAmong those who accepted day-time sleep, women particularly would\nschedule a nap to be able to cope better with daily household chores,\nsuch as gardening or cleaning, and were likely to plan to \u2018 take a nap\u2019\nor \u2018nod o\ufb00\u2019 between household activities, to be able to continue with\ntheir chores. Such a case was that of Helen, who was married and aged\n72 years :\nInterviewer : And how do you approach the napping. Is it something you con-\nsciously do?\nHelen: Yes, if we\u2019ve spent a morning in the garden, which we do this sort\nof weather, come lunchtime we sit down and have our lunch and\nI could easily nod o\ufb00, so I think right, if it\u2019s nod o\ufb00 time, it\u2019s nod o\ufb00\ntime, and I go o\ufb00. But then sometimes, it\u2019s not like that at all, and it\ncould be later in the afternoon, and I am thinking, before I cook\nsupper I must have a nap, so then I will do that.\nBeing active and productive in later life was seen not only in terms of paid\nwork and household chores, for leisure activities were also deemed im-\nportant. Many of the older people\u2019s narratives contained references to\nbeing \u2018busy \u2019 with social events, albeit occasionally marked with regret\nwhen declining energy curtailed the number that could be undertaken in\none day. Napping was therefore sometimes planned before a proposed\nleisure activity, such as playing bowls, or going out for an evening, in order\nto be refreshed and have enough energy to enjoy the activity. Yet\neven when a nap was seen as acceptable and desirable, it was not always\n204 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\npossible to nap as planned. Norman, married and aged 68 years, ex-\nplained:\nYesterday morning I did some work, quite a lot of work, putting that bathroom\nsuite in, in the afternoon. Now this is interesting, I mean I wanted to go to sleep\nbecause I had a game of bowls in the evening but I couldn\u2019t get o\ufb00.\nPlanned or unplanned napping was also seen as acceptable compensation\nfor a poor night\u2019s sleep, or series of poor nights, so that productivity could\nbe re-established. Another married man, Philip, aged 65 years, put it like\nthis : \u2018 It might happen [unplanned day-time nap] if I have lost a couple of\nnights \u2019 sleep, so then it is probably serving a purpose\u2019. Especially for the\noldest old, whose energy levels had diminished, napping was also seen as a\nway of using up time, or of passing the day, which for some retired people\nwas made even longer by their short sleep at night. Under these circum-\nstances, napping itself became an activity and was listed amongst their\nothers, particularly when it was planned for a speci\ufb01c time. Margaret, a\nwidow aged 86 years, explained, \u2018 I suppose really it [napping] is a way of\nusing up time, because when you are older, time doesn\u2019t have the same\nmeaning\u2019. The deterioration of some respondents\u2019 night-time sleep led to\ndecreasing energy levels and a tendency to nap or doze during the day.\nSo by accepting napping as part of their everyday routines, they were able\nto continue to be active and productive and to maintain their \u2018busy \u2019 lives.\nMost of those who accepted napping also accepted the inevitability of\ngrowing older.\nAccepting day-time sleep and the ageing process\nDeteriorating night-time sleep was seen by many as one of the inevitable\nmarkers of chronological ageing, alongside an expected increase in the\nfrequency of going to the toilet during the night. Just as there was an\nexpectation of frequent awakenings in the night, and of waking early in the\nmorning, the participants anticipated having less energy during the day\nand of experiencing day-time sleepiness. All were regarded as markers of\ngrowing older, and, for some, were reasons for accepting the bene\ufb01ts of\nnapping and accommodating it into their daily lives. As ageing itself was\nseen by some as inevitable, the indicators of it were also accepted. Yet the\nchanges that accompany ageing were not always initially accepted. Some\ninitially resisted ageing and napping, but their desire to remain active for\nas long as possible led to a re-appraisal of their attitude to day-time sleep.\nAs Helen re\ufb02ected:\nI have never been a person who sleeps in the day, but I just wonder. I suppose its\nold age coming on. It\u2019s needing more sleep, and I have a real belief and \u2026 you\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 205\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nknow, that sleep is extremely good for you. And I thought, \u2018oh how awful,\nI mustn\u2019t do this [nap]. It [made me feel] guilty \u2019. [But now] I think it\u2019s just an\nepisode in the day when you\u2019re building up for the rest of the day \u2026 that \u2026 it\u2019s\n\ufb01lled-in time, it\u2019s investment time, so that I can do something else.\nFor these respondents, napping was therefore acceptable because it was\nseen as an inevitable part of growing older, and part of growing older was\nrecognising and acknowledging bodily changes that take place, such as\ndecreasing energy levels, and accommodating these changes in order to\ncontinue being active and productive.\nAccepting day-time sleep : acknowledging bodily needs\nAs with Meadows et al.\u2019s (2008a) \ufb01nding from sleep among couples, that\nmen most often identi\ufb01ed their sleep needs in terms of their bodily\nneeds, older people who accepted day-time sleep in the current study most\noften recognised the primacy of their (ageing) bodies. Napping a\ufb00orded\nthem the opportunity to be more energetic and to cope with the day\u2019s\nactivities. Following a broken night\u2019s sleep, as commonly reported, a nap\nwas regarded as being refreshing and bene\ufb01cial, with the interviewees\nemphasising the need to \u2018 listen to what their body was saying\u2019 when there\nwas an overwhelming desire to sleep during the day. The signi\ufb01cance of\nrelinquishing control to the \u2018needs \u2019 of the body was especially important\nin terms of justifying unplanned napping or dozing. \u2018Giving in\u2019 to the\nbody and \u2018relinquishing control \u2019 were used to explain the power that the\nbody exerts over the mind when they fall asleep unintentionally during\nthe day. In the words of John, a married man aged 70 years, \u2018 I just think it\nis your body taking over and it is a natural thing\u2019. Therefore learning to\nacknowledge the changing needs of the (ageing) body was o\ufb00ered as a\nfurther reason for accepting napping. Jenny articulated this view excep-\ntionally well :\nDo you know what, I\u2019m learning as I\u2019m getting older? I\u2019m actually listening to my\nbody and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done in my life. I\u2019m so stubborn and [used\nto say], \u2018Oh no, I\u2019m not going to give in\u2019. I never wanted to give in [and would\nsay] \u2018No, I have got to keep going\u2019. Now I\u2019m listening. I\u2019m saying, \u2018okay, no, I\u2019m\nnot going to go on. I\u2019m going to have a rest now\u2019.\nThe ability to continue being active and busy in later life was of funda-\nmental importance for the older people in this study, and those who ac-\ncepted day-time sleep did so because they believed it would help them\nmaintain their daily routines and activities. So a planned nap, or giving in\nto their body\u2019s need for a doze, were all deemed acceptable, and ultimately\nseen as an inevitable part of growing older.\n206 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nResisting day-time sleep\nIn contrast to accepting a planned, or even unplanned but acknowledged\nnap, day-time sleep was resisted by over half the sample. The key to some\nolder people\u2019s denial of \u2018napping\u2019 was its perceived link to two supposedly\nnegative connotations: \ufb01rstly, that napping was identi\ufb01ed with laziness,\nand secondly, because it signi\ufb01ed ageing and a marker of an inevitably\ngreater age to come.\nFailing to be active\nRetirement from paid work was not seen as an excuse for being inactive,\nand sleeping during the day was regarded as : (a) an indication of idleness,\n(b) a waste of valuable and limited time, and (c) counter to the inherently\nstrong moral work ethic of their upbringing. Therefore any napping, or\neven unintentional dozing, held negative moral connotations and was\naccompanied by feelings of guilt. Two divorced respondents put such\nviews well, Debora aged 70 years, and Arthur aged 95 years :\nDebora: No, I don\u2019t believe I would ever [nap] because I think that it is the\nwork and play ethic again, isn\u2019t it? That I was brought up with. You\nknow, night-time\u2019s for sleep, eight hours for this, eight hours for that\nand eight hours for the other.\nInterviewer : And that doesn\u2019t include napping?\nDebora: No, not in my Mum\u2019s book anyway, it never did.\nArthur : Well I suppose [instead of napping], I would be doing something\nmore constructive like doing research or something or reading or\ndoing some gardening perhaps. Or seeing somebody. I do sketching\nas well, painting. \u2026 As I say, it is my puritanical background, you\nfeel that you have to be useful. You have to do something useful\nwith your time.\nThe times of day-time sleep in\ufb02uenced both its de\ufb01nition and whether\nit was acknowledged as taking place. For example, responding to the\nquestion, \u2018Do you ever fall asleep during the day? Mary, a widow aged\n80 years, denied that she napped but acknowledged that she fell asleep.\nShe said, \u2018 I never nap (during the day). \u2026 Oh, I do go o\ufb00 \u2026 do you know\nwhen I can have my half-an-hour\u2019s sleep? [It is] between half-past eleven\nand twelve\u2019. Another interviewee, Veronica, married and aged 68 years,\ninitially replied, \u2018No, I don\u2019t think so\u2019, but when asked by the interviewer,\n\u2018What about when watching television, would you fall asleep then?\u2019 she\nanswered, \u2018Oh yes, I do! \u2019 Clearly for Mary and Veronica, the \u2018half-an-\nhour\u2019s sleep\u2019 in the morning, or in front of the television, is not actually\nseen as a nap, it is quite di\ufb00erent. By denying that she \u2018naps \u2019, which is\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 207\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\ncounter to her belief about the need to be continuously active and\nproductive, Mary was free to discuss her day-time sleep. For those who\nresisted day-time sleep, any form of \u2018napping\u2019 during the day was strongly\ndenied, but other types of day-time sleep might be acknowledged if they\ncould be justi\ufb01ed. In the following extracts, Mary felt she needed to justify\nher half-hour\u2019s sleep by explaining she had been for a swim at eight o\u2019clock\nin the morning, but when prompted she did acknowledge other episodes\nof day-time sleep or dozing later in the day:\nMary: Half-an-hour, that\u2019s it, usually half-past-eleven till twelve. Why\nI pick that time of day, I don\u2019t know, but I suppose I have been\nswimming for half-an-hour and I don\u2019t stop, I just spin and turn,\nspin and turn, spin and turn. I don\u2019t ever stop, I keep on all the\nwhile.\nInterviewer : Is that the only nap you have during the day?\nMary: Yes, it has been known when I am watching television during the\nafternoon to sort of doze o\ufb00 for \ufb01ve minutes, if that, nothing to get\nexcited about.\nInterviewer : And in the evening you don\u2019t doze o\ufb00?\nMary: Yes ! About \ufb01ve minutes before the play ends ! And you wake up and\nthe news is on and you don\u2019t know who done it. That\u2019s when I sleep.\nWhereas day-time sleep, for those who resisted it, was regarded as a waste\nof time, dozing in the chair in the evening was not resisted to the same\nextent. As previously suggested, \u2018dozing\u2019 implies the maintenance of some\nlevel of consciousness and was therefore not regarded as proper \u2018 sleeping\u2019.\nAdditionally, dozing would be more likely to take place at the end of the\nday when all tasks had been undertaken, so that a doze in front of the\ntelevision was potentially acceptable, and even seen as inevitable in later\nlife. Ray, aged 67 years, had no problem countering the interviewer\u2019s hint\nof an inconsistency:\nInterviewer : Okay, you\u2019ve talked a bit about falling asleep in front of the telly in\nthe evening, and you said that is absolutely \ufb01ne. You don\u2019t think\nthere is an issue with that?\nRay: Oh no, no, I just take it as a natural thing as you get older.\nInterviewer : Would you feel the same if you actually fell asleep during the day.\nWould you feel the same way about \u2026\nRay: Probably not \u2026 probably not.\nInterviewer : Why is that, do you know?\nRay: Well, because I like to do things during the day time.\nJust as some of those who now accepted napping had resisted it initially,\nothers who resisted napping had realised that a time may come when their\nattitude changes. Rather than accept the change compliantly, however,\n208 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nthey still resisted the idea of napping and would consider it only if it\nallowed them to continue their active lifestyle. Some adjustments were\nenvisaged, such as a nap to stave o\ufb00 what was perceived as an inevitable\ndecline into old age \u2013 which they also felt should be resisted. As John\nreasoned:\nJohn: [If my sleep worsens] I might need a rest in the afternoon to catch\nup, sort of thing.\nInterviewer : You are not too keen on that idea?\nJohn: Well no, not really, because I mean, I like to, we like to go out as a\npartnership. We feel that we are not that old, you know, we are sort\nof fairly mobile.\nMaintaining mental acuity in later life was also seen as very important by\nthe respondents in this study, perhaps because of a (largely unspoken) fear\nof declining cognitive ability or dementia, but had greater signi\ufb01cance for\nsome of those who resisted day-time sleep. Some of the participants who\nresisted day-time sleep, because it was seen as a waste of time, linked the\nneed to be physically active with their mental health, and falling asleep\nduring the day was resisted because they saw it as a potential risk to\ntheir mental health, as expressed by Jeremy, who was 69 years old and\ndivorced:\nIt is necessary to my mental health [activity]. You know, I just don\u2019t feel \u2013 I\nfeel \u2013 it is like every day if I haven\u2019t done something, if I haven\u2019t cleaned some-\nthing, or painted something or made something I feel I have wasted the day.\nThose older people who resisted day-time sleep largely did so because of\nthe perception that napping is lazy and a waste of time, time which they\nfelt would be better spent undertaking household chores or leisure activi-\nties. Continuing to be active in later life was also seen as important in\ncontributing to mental health. There was some expectation that the need\nto nap may increase with age, but napping was still resisted. The language\nused to describe day-time sleep very much re\ufb02ected older people\u2019s atti-\ntudes towards it, with dozing, to some extent, being acceptable under\nsome circumstances, such as in the evening after a full day\u2019s activities, but\nnapping was always strongly denied.\nResisting day-time sleep and the ageing process\nThose who resisted the idea of getting older resisted the physical signi\ufb01ers\nof ageing, which alongside going to the toilet frequently in the night in-\ncluded dozing o\ufb00 in the chair and napping at set times during the day.\nNapping, as part of the routine of daily life, was regarded as, in the words\nof Jeremy, \u2018an old person\u2019s syndrome\u2019, and therefore to be avoided.\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 209\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nWhilst there was some recognition that overall sleep had changed with\nage, and to some extent these changes were expected, some older people\nresisted the idea of day-time sleep because of its indication of ageing. When\nMatthew, aged 67 years and married, was asked, \u2018Do you think there\u2019ll\never come a time when you might [nap]?\u2019 he replied, \u2018Well, I hope not.\nI hope not, because I think it would re\ufb02ect on the fact that I was really\ngetting past it \u2019. Veronica was also negative about sleeping during the day\nfor the two reasons that she elided: \u2018For me, it [day-time sleep] is a waste\nof time, it might be an admission that you are getting older \u2019. Whereas\nthose who accepted napping talked of \u2018 relinquishing control \u2019 and giving in\nto their body and their body\u2019s needs, those who resisted day-time sleep saw\nnapping as losing power over their potentially failing bodies. However,\nbeing ill, or taking prescribed medications for illness, were legitimate\nreasons for sleeping during the day. Jane, who was married and aged\n78 years, explained:\nBut I don\u2019t [nap], only if I am not well, which is rare for me. Then I go sometimes\nto bed in the afternoon. But if I have \u2018\ufb02u or something then I might, but otherwise\nI don\u2019t. No.\nFinally, some respondents who resisted day-time sleep not only did so\nbecause of the negative moral connotations that surround it, but also for\npragmatic reasons. Some who did not sleep well during the night re-\ncognised that day-time dozing or napping may reduce the quality and\nquantity of their night-time sleep, and for that reason was resisted. In the\nwords of Alex, divorced and aged 67 years, \u2018 I think if I sleep or nap during\nthe day is that going to make me sleep even worse at night \u2019. Reginald, a\nwidow aged 92 years, con\ufb01ded that, \u2018The specialist said to me, \u2018\u2018 try and\navoid sleeping during the day because it a\ufb00ects you at night \u2019\u2019, but it is\nhard, that is \u2019. As mentioned previously, to be active in later life was seen as\nfundamentally important, and those who resisted napping did so because\nof the perception that time spent sleeping during the day was wasted time.\nIf day-time sleep did take place, it was rarely openly acknowledged, and\nwas regarded as a \u2018doze\u2019, usually in the evening, and only after a full day\u2019s\nactivities. However, those who resisted day-time sleep foresaw a time as\nthey got older when a nap might be inevitable or unavoidable during the\nday, but only in order to continue an active and productive life, and any\nnapping would still be undertaken reluctantly.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nIn line with policy frameworks that promote the link between \u2018active\nageing\u2019, health and independent living, the older people in this study\n210 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nagreed that it was imperative to remain active, productive, healthy and\nindependent past retirement and into old age. Retirement from full-time\npaid employment was not seen as a justi\ufb01cation or excuse for reducing\npre-retirement activity levels, even amongst those who continued to work\npart-time. In common with over 60 per cent of older people in the UK\n(Almeida and Pfa\ufb00 2005), however, all the study respondents experienced\npoor night-time sleep, which led to an increase in day-time sleepiness and\nin\ufb02uenced their ability to maintain their daily routines and activities. The\nkey to achieving \u2018active ageing\u2019 for these older people, therefore, was to\ncompensate for the decreased energy levels that resulted from losses of\nnight-time sleep by the strategic use of day-time sleep.\nIn total, 57 of the 62 people in this study reported that they slept during\nthe day, albeit with highly variable frequencies, timing and durations.\nHowever, their attitudes to day-time sleep tended to be polarised, in that\nnapping was either conceptualised as facilitating an active life, or seen as a\nbarrier to remaining active. Older people who accepted and acknowl-\nedged napping were likely to do so because of their desire to remain\nphysically and mentally active, and indicated that a nap helps to sustain\nenergy, and to enable household chores and leisure pursuits to be under-\ntaken. Dozing too was accepted and readily acknowledged, especially in\ncertain circumstances, such as after morning exercise or whilst watching\nthe television. Ageing, for those who accepted day-time sleep, was seen as\nan inevitable process which was linked to a greater propensity to fall asleep\nduring the day, and adjustments to the day were made to accommodate\nnapping. Napping and dozing were seen as an inevitable accompaniment\nof ageing, along with bodily decline. Therefore those who accepted day-\ntime sleep were learning to listen to their bodily needs and were\ncomfortable with relinquishing control to their (tired) bodies.\nAround one-half of the sample resisted napping. They focused on\navoiding day-time sleep because of the perception that sleeping during the\nday was: (a) lazy, (b) a waste of time and (c) counter to the strong moral\nwork ethic that they had grown up with and practised throughout their\nworking lives. Any day-time sleep that did take place was accompanied by\na sense of guilt unless a full day\u2019s activity had been undertaken. Falling\nasleep in front of the television in the evening, after a long, active and\nproductive day, was termed \u2018dozing\u2019 and not napping but was also\nresisted. Whereas napping was regarded as a planned sleep and could be\n(reluctantly) admitted to, dozing was not regarded as sleep by those\nwho resisted it. Ageing and the signi\ufb01ers of ageing, such as napping and\nfrequent visits to the toilet at night, were also resisted. Unintentional day-\ntime sleep was seen as akin to losing power over their (potentially) failing\nbody, and thus, combined with the perception that day-time sleep is\nDay-time sleep and active ageing 211\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nsomehow \u2018 immoral \u2019 and time-wasting, served to reinforce the negativity\nthat may surround ageing and the ageing process.\nPoor night-time sleep and napping have implications for health and\nwellbeing in later life (Xu et al. 2010), therefore including advice about the\nimpact of day-time sleep in debates on \u2018active ageing\u2019 is essential. For\nexample, some research \ufb01ndings have suggested that napping is detri-\nmental in later life as it is related to an increased rate of mortality\n(Newman et al. 2000; Steenhuysen 2008), or that napping can lead to an\nincreased risk of falls (Brassington, King and Bliwise 2000; Stone et al.\n2006). In contrast, other \ufb01ndings suggest that napping in later life is bene-\n\ufb01cial in terms of improving cognitive functioning and that brief planned\nnaps may bene\ufb01t both healthy older adults and those in poor health (Ficca\net al. 2009; Ohayon et al. 2004).\nSuch research does not, however, take into account the meaning of day-\ntime sleep for older people. For example, Frisoni et al.\u2019s (1996) study of\nolder people and sleep used only a dichotomy (napping or not napping) to\ndescribe day-time sleep, and did not take into account unplanned or un-\nintentional napping or dozing. Although some people may be willing to\ndiscuss frequency and duration of day-time naps, others who resist taking\na nap may deny any day-time sleep or dozing because of the implication\nthat they are \u2018whiling away\u2019 their days in non-productive activities. If\nresearchers ask older people to list only the number and duration of naps\ntaken over 24 hours, they are unlikely to capture all episodes of sleep. The\npicture would be quite di\ufb00erent if older people were asked to recall any\ntime they involuntarily \u2018dozed o\ufb00\u2019 or \u2018nodded o\ufb00\u2019 in front of the tele-\nvision. Additionally, evening dozing or unplanned napping may be con-\nsidered part of night-time sleep because of its proximity to bed-time, which\nhas signi\ufb01cance for the subjective assessment of overall sleep duration and\nquality of sleep.\nThis paper has demonstrated that older people with poor night-time\nsleep clearly link day-time sleep with perceptions of ageing, and with the\ndesire to continue to engage in \u2018active ageing\u2019. Older people who ac-\nknowledged napping in later life as an acceptable strategy for maintaining\nday-time activity levels, and as an inevitable signi\ufb01er of ageing, allowed for\nthe possibility of what it may be like to break away from the negative\ndiscourses surrounding inactive ageing. The links between activity, health,\nwellbeing and quality of life in older people were originally identi\ufb01ed in\nactivity theory (Havighurst 1963) and later translated into numerous \u2018ac-\ntive ageing\u2019 policy frameworks. All of the older people in this study ex-\npressed both the desire to be active and a fear of being inactive, and\nacknowledged that continuing to be active had at least some bene\ufb01ts for\ntheir health and mental wellbeing. Jolanki\u2019s study in Finland also showed\n212 Susan Venn and Sara Arber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.174.135\nthat older people associated being active with being healthy, and pres-\nented themselves as productive \u2018worthy members of society \u2019, but also\nadopted an \u2018old\u2019 or aged identity as an explanation for ill health and a\njusti\ufb01cation for inactivity (2009: 263). Just as Ekerdt (1986) and Katz (2005)\nhave suggested, however, a strong moral work ethic also reinforces the\nimperative to remain active, so that activity itself and the bene\ufb01ts derived\nfrom it are not always of great signi\ufb01cance, just that some or any activity is\nundertaken. Regardless of the type or level of activity undertaken, the\nimportance of continuing to be active was paramount for these older\npeople, and for this to be sustained they saw the management of day-time\nsleep as fundamental.\nAcknowledgements\nThe SomnIA (Sleep in Ageing) research was funded by the New Dynamics of\nAgeing initiative, a multidisciplinary research programme supported by the\nEconomic and Social Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,\nthe Medical Research Council, and the Arts and Humanities Research Council\n(RES-339-25-0009).
