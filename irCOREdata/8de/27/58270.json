After adjusting for temperature and \noutdoor radon, each of geological unit, house type, double glazing and date of \nbuilding were found to have a statistically significant influence on indoor radon \nconcentrations and explained about 29% of the total variation between dwellings in \nlogarithmically transformed radon values.  In addition, there were statistically \nsignificant differences in radon concentrations according to proximity to geological \nboundaries categories for most of the geological units, but no consistent pattern could \nbe detected.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nExposure to radon in homes is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the UK after \ncigarette smoking and behaves like smoking in that the lung cancer risk increases with \nlong term exposure (AGIR, 2009).  \n \nThe main sources of radon in dwellings are soil and rocks.  The rate of emission from \nthese sources and hence the potential for concentration within houses varies \nconsiderably with location.   Radon gas can enter a dwelling by the process of flow of \nair from the ground through cracks and other holes in the foundations.  It is also \nknown that variation in the weather and substructure type influence the amount of \nradon gas that enters a dwelling.  Previous studies have shown that house-specific \nfactors (e.g. house type, double glazing, floor type), structural alterations to the \nbuilding (e.g. cavity wall insulation, blocking of a chimney and sealed floors), \nvariation in the lifestyle of those living in the dwelling and rock type in the area of \ndwellings (geographical region) have notable effects on indoor radon levels (Hunter et \nal 2004; Gerken et al 2000; Gunby et al 1993).  However, these studies included only \na small proportion of houses in UK and did not examine geological boundaries. \n  \nWe have performed analyses based on data for about 40,000 dwellings in order to \nevaluate the impact of house-specific factors for six contrasting geological units in \nUK and to assess differences in radon levels as a function of proximity to geological \nboundaries. This study formed an input to improvements in mapping methodology for \nEngland and Wales (Miles and Appleton 2005; Miles et al 2007). \n \n \n \n 3 \nHOUSE SPECIFIC FACTORS \n \nData \nThe data were collected by the National Radiological Protection Board (now the \nRadiological Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency) throughout the UK \nas part of various surveys of exposure to radon in dwellings in UK (Miles & Appleton \n2005; Kendall et al 2005; Wrixon et al 1988). A total of 39,823 radon measurements \nwere obtained in England.  All measurements were carried out using alpha-etched \ntrack detectors that were exposed for three months in the main living area and in a \nsleeping area in the house.  The mean radon concentration for each dwelling was \ncalculated by taking a weighted average of the concentrations in the bedroom and \nliving room, correcting for the temperature at the time of measurement (Miles 1998) \nand subtracting the mean outdoor radon concentrations of 4 Bq m\n-3\n (Wrixon et \nal.1988). The geometric mean of the dataset was 61.7 Bq m\n-3\n and the geometric \nstandard deviation was 2.9.  Figure 1 shows a histogram of the logarithms of the mean \nradon concentrations from all 39,823 dwellings in the dataset. These data are normally \ndistributed (solid line).   \n                   \n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nLog radon measurements (Bq m-3)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nD\ne\nn\ns\nity\n \n  \nFigure 1: Histogram (with a normal distribution line) of logarithms of all radon \nconcentrations, corrected for temperature and outdoor radon.    \nSelection of covariates  \nVarious covariates were recorded, of which a subset most likely to affect radon \nconcentrations was selected for this study.  The variables chosen were: geological \nunit, house type, building year, living room and bedroom floor type, storey level for \nliving room and bedroom, double-glazing, draught proofing and ownership.  The \ncovariates were categorised into the following groups: \n \n Geological units: NS-IRST (Jurassic Northampton Sand Formation; ironstone and \nsandstone), MCM-MDST (Carboniferous Pennine Middle Coal Measures \nFormation; mudstone), EXE-COSD (Permian Exeter Group; interbedded \nconglomerate and sandstone), CDF-DOLO (Permian Cadeby Formation; dolomite \nrock), CAIN-CCRG (Carboniferous to Permian Carnmenellis Intrusion; coarse \ngrained granite) or BLL-LMST (Carboniferous Bee Low Limestone Formation); \n House Type: detached, semi-detached, mid-terraced, flat , other or unknown; \n 4 \n Double-glazing: none, all, partial or unknown; \n Building year: Pre 1900, 1900-1919, 1920-1944, 1945-1964, 1965-1976, 1977-92, \npost 1992 or unknown; \n Floor level (living area and bedroom): basement and ground floor, above the \nground floor, bedroom above living room or unknown; \n Floor type (living area and bedroom): all solid, all suspended, mixed or unknown; \n Draught proofing: none, all, partial or unknown; \n Ownership: owner-occupier, rent from council, rent privately, other or unknown. \n \nTable 1 shows summary statistics for temperature and outdoor radon corrected data \nfrom the whole dataset, for each of the geological units. Overall, the geometric mean \nand geometric standard deviation from 39,823 houses were 61.7 Bq m\n-3\nand 2.92 \nrespectively. The lowest geometric mean was observed in MCM-MDST (21 Bq m\n-3\n) \nand the highest geometric means were found in CAIN-CCRG (229.6 Bq m\n-3\n) and \nBLL-LMST (129.3 Bq m\n-3\n).  As expected, these latter two geological units are also \nthe units with the highest percentage of homes greater than the UK radon action level \n(200 Bq m\n-3\n).  \n \n Geological unit \n \nAll  \n \nNS-\nIRST \nMCM-\nMDST \nEXE-\nCOSD \n \nCDF-\nDOLO \nCAIN-\nCCRG \nBLL-\nLMST \nNumber of dwellings 39,823 25,177 2,404 5,342 2,645 2,082 2,173 \nGeometric Mean  \n(Bq m\n-3\n) \n61.7 65.5 21.0 41.0 40.7 229.6 129.3 \nGeometric std. deviation 2.92 2.77 2.14 2.13 2.47 2.45 2.78 \n% homes > 200 Bq m\n-3\n  14 14 0.2 2 4 56 33 \n \nTable 1: Summary statistics for radon concentration data from 39, 823 houses \nStatistical Methods \nFactors affecting indoor radon concentrations were investigated using regression \nanalysis.  A multiplicative model was used to explain variations in indoor radon \nconcentrations. The model takes the form: \n \n(R i - 4) = iodpftflbydghg E.........           (1)   \n \nHere R i  represents the average indoor radon concentration corrected for temperature \nof house i (i=1 ,\u2026.., 39,823) and 4 Bq m-3 is the mean outdoor radon concentration, \nrepresents the true average radon level for all dwellings in the study, g represents \nthe geological unit category (g =1,..,6), h represents the house type category \n(h=1,..,6), dg represents the double glazing category (dg =1,..,4), by represents the \nbuilding year category (by=1,\u2026,8), fl represents the floor level of bedroom and living \narea category (fl =1,..,4), o represents the ownership category (o =1,..,5), dp represents \ndraft proofing (dp= 1,\u2026,4), ft represents floor type of bedroom and living room \n 5 \n(ft=1,..,4) and \niE represents random error in the measurement and is normally \ndistributed with mean 0 and variance 2 . The definitions of these categories are \nsummarised in Table 3.  The statistical model in Equation 1 was fitted to the \nlogarithmically transformed data, using stepwise forward regression.  The \nparameters , dpftflbydghg ,,,,,, and o  were defined in the model as fixed \neffects and were estimated from the logarithmic transformed data using the S-Plus \nstatistical package.   \nResults \nWe studied a total of 39,823 dwellings and Table 2 shows the percentage of the \nvariation in the logged radon data explained by each of the factors in the final model \n(Equation 1).  The total percentage of variation explained by the factors in this model \nis 29%.  Geological units had a highly statistically significant influence and explained \nabout 20% of the variation. House type, double-glazing, date of build, and the floor \nlevel of the living area and bedroom explained smaller percentages of the variation \n(3.8%, 2.4%, 1.0 and 1.0% respectively).  The remaining three house specific factors \n(floor type, ownership and draught proofing) accounted for yet smaller percentages all \ntogether (0.7% of the total variation).  Further analyses were also performed for each \ngeological unit to evaluate impact of house specific factors; as can be seen from Table \n2, house type, double glazing and date of building were the main contributors to the \nvariation in logged radon concentrations for each of the geological units considered.  \nThe highest variation explained by these factors arose in CDF-DOLO (18.6%) and the \nlowest variation was found in NS-IRST and BLL-LMST (both were 12%).   \n \n  % of variation explained \nSource of \nVariation \nNo. of data \ncategories \nAll \ngeological \nunits \nNS-\nIRST \nMCM-\nMDST \nEXE-COSD \n \nCDF-\nDOLO \nCAIN-\nCCRG \nBLL-LMST \nNo. of  dwellings  39,823 25,177 2,404 5,342 2,645 2,082 2,173 \nGeological unit 6 19.7 _ _ _ _ _ _ \nHouse type 6 3.8 5.3 4.2 4.2 1.2 4.4 2.7 \nDouble-glazing 4 2.3 3.2 3.3 4.7 7.6 2.7 1.4 \nDate of building 8 1.1 1.2 3.8 4.0 8.6 2.8 3.6 \nFloor level of living \narea and bedroom \n4 1.0 0.9 _ 1.4 _ _ 0.7 \nFloor type of living \narea and bedroom \n4 0.5 0.9 1.3 0.4 1.2 2.1 3.1 \nOwnership 5 0.1 0.2 0.9 _  _ 0.8 0.5 \nDraught proofing 4 0.1 0.2 0.4 _     _ _ _ \nTotal variation  28.6 11.9 13.9 14.7 18.6 12.8 12 \n, intercept  \n(Bq m\n-3\n) \n 144 53 21 28 32 145 86 \n \nTable 2: Percentage of total variation in logged radon concentrations explained by each of the \nfactors selected for the final model. \n \n \n 6 \nIt is notable in Table 2 that the factors explaining the highest percentage of variation \nin the CDF-DOLO geological unit (ie. date of building and double glazing) explain a \nvery low percentage of variation in the aggregated data. It is possible that this is due \nto the construction of housing estates with similar indoor radon levels. The houses on \nsuch estates will have the roughly same date of construction, whereas different estates \nbuilt at different times may have different mean radon concentrations. The differences \ncaused by this effect could well be important at a local level, but be averaged out \nwhen the whole data set is considered.  \n \n \n \nParameters \n \nNumber of \ndwellings \nEstimated \nvalue\nb\n(SE) \nParameters \n \nNumber of \ndwellings \nEstimated \nvalue\nb\n (SE) \nGeological unit   Date of building   \n1 , NS-IRST\na\n 25,177 1 1 , pre 1900\na\n 5,267 1 \n2 , MCM-MDST 2,404 0.24 (0.02) 2 , 1900-1919 2,885 0.83 (0.02) \n3 , EXE-COSD 5,342 0.55 (0.02) 3 , 1920-1944 5,009 0.86 (0.02) \n4 , CDF-DOLO 2,645 0.50 (0.02) 4 , 1945-1964 6,147 0.77 (0.02) \n5 , CAIN-CCRG 2,082 2.9 (0.02) 5 , 1965-1976 5,940 0.74 (0.02) \n6 , BLL-LMST 2,173 1.9 (0.02) 6 , 1977-1992 7,675 0.72 (0.02) \nHouse type   7 , post 1992 913 0.67 (0.04) \n1 , detached\na\n 12,198 1 8 , unknown \n5,987 0.68 (0.02) \n2 , semi-detached 13,648 0.80 (0.01) \nFloor type of living \narea and bedroom \n  \n3 , mid-terraced 9,062 0.71 (0.02) 1 , all solid\na\n 4,796 1 \n4 , flats 2,681 0.52 (0.03) 2 , all suspended 15,159 0.72 (0.02) \n5 , other 579 0.86 (0.04) 3 , mixed 14,346 0.72 (0.02) \n6 , unknown 1,655 0.83 (0.05) 4 , unknown 5,522 0.79 (0.02) \nDouble glazing   Ownership   \n1 , none\na\n 13,349 1 \n1 , owner\na\n 30,814 1 \n2 , all 5,939 1.66 (0.02) 2 , rent from council 5,652 0.86 (0.01) \n3 , partial 17,657 1.27 (0.01) 3 , rent privately 1,532 0.92 (0.03)  \n4 , unknown 2,878 1.20 (0.03) 4 , other 344 0.95 (0.06) * \nFloor level of living area \nand bedroom \n  5 , unknown \n1,481 \n0.90 (0.05)* \n1 , ground\na\n 35,101 1 Draught proofing   \n2 , above 2,453 0.63 (0.02) 1 , none\na\n 16,753 1 \n3 , bedroom above liv. 688 0.77 (0.04) 2 , all 1,668 1.15 (0.03) \n4 , unknown 1,581 0.86 (0.05) 3 , partial 12,209 1.10 (0.01) \n   4 , unknown 9,193 1.07 (0.02) \na\n: Reference category; \nb : Temperature and outdoor radon corrected; * Statistically not significant (P>0.05) \n \nTable 3: Estimated parameter effects for categories of each house specific factor, with \nstandard errors (SE) in parentheses, based on the whole data set.  \n 7 \nThe estimated model parameters, together with their standard errors (SE), are shown \nin exponent form in Table 3.  These effects are described as multiplicative increases \nor decreases relative to the baseline category for each factor. Geological units were \nestimated to have the greatest statistically significant effect. The highest mean indoor \nradon levels were in CAIN-CCRG (Carnmenellis granite) and BLL-LMST (Bee Low \nLimestone Formation) type areas, and were higher by a factor of 2 and 3 times \nrespectively than the levels in the NS-IRST (Northampton Sand Formation) type \nareas.  The lowest radon levels arose in the MCM-MDST (Pennine Middle Coal \nMeasures Formation) areas (see Table 3).  The second most important factor in \nexplaining variation in radon concentrations was the house type.  Levels in semi-\ndetached houses were 20% lower on average than in detached houses; the \ncorresponding reductions for mid-terraced houses and flats (relative to detached \nhouses) were 29% and 48% respectively.  Houses with all windows double glazed had \n66% higher radon concentrations relative to houses with no double glazing; the \ncorresponding increase for partially double glazed homes was 27%. \n \nThe date of building was also found to have an effect on radon concentrations; the \nhighest concentrations arose in houses built before 1900 and decreased with year of \nbuild (see Table 3).  As was expected, houses with suspended wooden flooring had \nlower concentrations (by a factor of 0.72) relative to these with solid type flooring. \nCouncil houses had lower concentrations than owner occupied houses.  The final \nfactor found to be related to indoor radon concentrations was draught proofing; \nhouses with full or some draught proofing had slightly higher (15% and 10% \nrespectively) concentrations than houses without draught proofing. \n \nPOSITION OF GEOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES \n \nGeological boundaries on the BGS 1:50,000 scale DiGMapGB-50 digital geological \nmaps have an average positional uncertainty of 50 metres.  The uncertainty varies \nfrom place to place.  For example, it may be particularly difficult for geologists to \nlocate boundaries in areas where there are few exposures or topographic features and \nin areas that were built up when the geological survey was carried out (Miles & \nAppleton 2005).  \n \nConsequently, misclassification may arise from allocation of indoor radon results to \nthe incorrect geological unit, because the exact position of either the geological \nboundary or the house (or both) is uncertain.  In other cases changes in the thickness, \nlithology, mineralogy and permeability of the underlying rocks, topographic slope, \nsoil characteristics etc. may cause the radon potential near geological boundaries to be \ndifferent from the radon potential in the centre of a mapped geological unit.  \n \nThe dataset that was prepared to evaluate the impact of house specific factors was also \nused to analyse radon levels as a function of proximity to geological boundaries.  As \nbefore, the radon measurements were corrected for temperature and outdoor radon.  \nPrecise information on the magnitude of uncertainty in individual geological \nboundaries is not available, but 50 metres is accepted by the British Geological \nSurvey as an average uncertainty.  This statistical evaluation sought to see whether \nthere is evidence that measurements within either 50 metres or 100 metres of the \nmapped geological boundary are atypical of the geological unit as a whole. \nArcMap\/ArcView SHP files of 50 metre and 100 metre internally buffered geological \n 8 \npolygons for a selected range of geological units were produced and indoor radon \nmeasurements with Ordnance Survey ADDRESS-POINT\u00ae co-ordinates were \nattributed according to the buffer zone in which they were located.  \nAnalyses of houses at 0-50 metres and at 50-100 metres from a geological \nboundary \nThe radon levels were investigated in relation to the distance from the boundary of \neach of the six geological units considered earlier.  For all of the units, statistically \nsignificant differences in radon levels were found between houses either 0-50 metres \nor 50-100 metres from the boundary, when compared with houses more than 100 \nmetres from the boundary (Table 4).  In particular, radon levels were lower in houses \nwithin 0-50 metres of the boundary for BLL-LMST, CDF-DOLO, EXE-COSD and \nNS-IRST, but were higher within 0-50 metres of the boundary for CAIN-CCRG.  \nFurthermore, radon levels were statistically significantly lower in houses 50 to 100 \nmetres of the boundary compared with those further away for BLL-LMST, EXE-\nCOSD, MCM-MDST and NS-IRST, but were statistically significantly higher for \nCAIN-CCRG and CDF-DOLO (see Table 4). No account was taken of the tectonic \ndip of the geological units.

It \nwas decided, therefore, to extend the evaluation of variation with distance from a \ngeological boundary by looking at findings over 100 metre intervals: namely 0-100 m, \n100-200 m, 200-300 m etc. Statistically significant differences in radon levels were \nfound between boundaries categories for each of the six geological units studied, but \nno consistent pattern could be detected (not shown here).  Where these differences \n 9 \nextend hundreds of metres from the boundary, as in the case of EXE-COSD, it is clear \nthat they could not be caused by uncertainties in the position of the boundary.   \n \n \nDISCUSSION and CONCLUSIONS \n \nMultiple regression analysis has demonstrated that geology and house specific factors \nsuch as house type, double glazing, floor level of the bedroom\/living area and date of \nbuilding explain 29% of the total variation in logged radon levels in this dataset of \naround 40,000 dwellings.  Geological unit alone explained about 20% of the variation,  \nwhereas house type, double glazing and other factors contributed smaller percentages. \nIt would be possible to correct radon results for an individual dwelling for differences \nbetween that dwelling and a \u201cstandard\u201d house.  If a \u201cstandard\u201d house were to be used \nin mapping, then these house-specific factors would significantly affect the variability \nin maps. However, Appleton and Miles (2009) have reported that the percentage of \nvariation explained by geology is the same both with and without house standardised \ndata. In the late 1990s, the UK Government Departments funding radon surveys \nrequested that actual house data rather than \u201cstandardised\u201d house data should be used \nfor radon mapping. \n \nThis study also examined how much variation is explained by house specific factors \nin areas where geological units were mapped. The total radon variation explained by \nthese house factors was highest in the Cadeby Formation (CDF-DOLO, 19%) and \nlower in the Pennine Middle Coal Measures Formation (MCM-MDST, 14%), \nCarnmenellis Intrusion (CAIN-CCRG, 13%), Northampton Sand Formation (NS-\nIRST, 12%) and Bee Low Limestone Formation (BLL-MST, 12%). Appleton & Miles \n(2009) reported that grouping indoor radon data into 1 km grid squares explains 23% \nand 26% of intra-geological unit variation for NS-IRST and CAIN-CCRG \nrespectively and 20% of the variation within CDF-DOLO.  However, the study by \nAppleton & Miles (2009) did not take account of house specific factors. Hence, it is \ndifficult to deduce the relative contribution of house, geological, pedological and \nother factors to the overall variations within these geological units. \n \nThere were also statistically significant differences in radon levels between houses \nwithin 0 to 50 metres of a geological boundary compared to houses further than 100 \nmetres from the boundary for four out of six geological units studied.  The largest \ndifference was a reduction of 25% for NS-IRST and an increase of 13% for CAIN-\nCCRG.  For most of the geological units studied, radon concentrations were \nstatistically significantly different between houses within 50-100 metres of the \nboundary and those further away.  The largest differences ranged from an increase of \n20% to a decrease of 17%.  Evaluation of measurement data grouped by 100 metre \nintervals away from a geological boundary indicated statistically significant \ndifferences in radon levels between some boundary categories for all six of the \ngeological units studied, but no consistent pattern could be detected.  It is concluded \nthat the pattern of variation is so inconsistent between geological units and distances \nfrom boundaries that it is impractical to correct for uncertainty in the position of \ngeological boundaries.  \n \n \n \n 10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAGIR (Advisory Group on Ionising Radiation) 2009, Report of the independent \nadvisory group on Radon in UK (in preparation) \n \nAppleton J D and Miles J C H, 2009 A statistical evaluation of the geogenic controls \non indoor radon concentrations and radon risk.
