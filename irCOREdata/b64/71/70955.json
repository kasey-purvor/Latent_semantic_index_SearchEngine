Indications and morbidity \nKapasi F, Chandrasekar P, Barber C, Samman R,  \nPotluri B and Virdi J. \n \nMethods \nA study was conducted on accurate data maintained on 400 \npatients who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided \nprostate biopsy. Patients were divided into three groups \ndepending on the number of cores and each group was \nsubdivided into two based on the PSA level (PSA<20 & \nPSA>20).  TRUS biopsy procedure was carried out using B and \nK medical ultrasound scanner no. 2002 (Panther Unit) using \nBiplanor rectal probe (8551). An 18G, 20cm biopsy needle \n(Biopty gun) was used.  \nIntravenous Gentamicin 120mg, Metronidazole 500mg \nsuppository given at the time of procedure, followed by oral \nOfloxacin 400mg for three days were routinely used as antibiotic \nprophylaxis.The usual method of collection of the prostatic \nbiopsy specimen is depositing it into a formalin pot directly from \nthe biopsy needle; this leads to fragmentation of the specimen \ngiving unsatisfactory results. \nWe have developed a new technique for the collection of biopsy \nspecimen. In our method, the specimen from the needle is \nmounted onto a formalin soaked sponge (figure 1). The sponge is \nthen secured in a small cartridge, which is locked and deposited \ninto the formalin pot (figure 2). By this method all specimens are \nkept intact and delivered safely to the pathology department. This \ngives pathologists accurate numbers of cores, which are easy to \nprocess and adds to reduction in preparation time. \nIntroduction & Objectives \nTransrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is the standard procedure \nfor detecting prostate cancers. It is uncertain how many cores are \nneeded to optimise the detection of these cancers. The aim of this \nstudy was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of Prostatic \ncarcinoma relating to the number of cores of prostate biopsy and \nits associated morbidity. \nThe cancer detection rate for patients with a PSA of less than 20 \nis not significantly improved if the number of cores taken is \nincreased from 6-7 to 8-9, 0.2>p<0.25 (1 tailed t-test); however, \nincreasing cores from 8-9 to >10 and from 6-7 to >10 does \nsignificantly increase the detection rate, p valves of <0.025 and \n<0.005. There is no difference in the detection rate with the \nincrease in number of core biopsies when the PSA is greater than \n20. Mean detection rate 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.85. \nComplications \nThe complications were: clot retention in one (0.25%), rectal \nbleed in two (0.5%) and urethral bleed in two (0.5%). These were \nonly observed in patients who underwent more than 10 core \nbiopsies. None developed septicaemia requiring emergency \nadmission. \nResults and Conclusions \n1.  Diagnostic accuracy improved from 14% to 34% by \nincreasing the number of cores from six to twelve when PSA is \nless than <20 particularly inT1c prostatic cancer, however, it did \nnot improve when the PSA was >20 and >T1 disease. \n2.  In this study the complication relating to prostatic biopsy was \n1.25%, which was recorded in patients who had more than 10 \ncores biopsy. In spite of this, to increase diagnostic accuracy in \nT1c disease we recommend more than 10 core biopsy. \n3.  Our antibiotic regime is effective in protecting episodes of \nsepticaemia.  \n4.  The method of collection of specimen has distinct advantages \nin preserving specimens and increasing speed of processing \nAnorectal dysfunction after 3-D conformal radiotherapy for \nlocalised  prostate cancer  \nDickon Hayne, Nula Allen, Dan Ashdown, Amanda Mellon,  \nJohn Glaholm, Mike Foster \nGood Hope Hospital, Birmingham,   \n \nIntroduction: \nPrevious work (Ref 1, 2) has shown a very high incidence of \nanorectal side effects with associated changes on anorectal \nphysiology following conventional radiotherapy for localised \nprostate cancer (CaP). We report early results on the first \nprospective study aiming to identify symptoms and quantify \nanorectal dysfunction after 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3D-\nCRT) for CaP. \nPatients & methods: \nEthical approval was obtained from the North Birmingham \nRegional Ethics Committee. Twelve men (median age 66 years) \nwith CaP were treated with 3D-CRT using a hypofractionated \nschedule of 55Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. All patients \ncompleted incontinence\/proctitis symptom scores, endo-anal \nultrasonography and anorectal physiological studies before and 6 \nweeks after RT. Results were expressed as medians and ranges \nand compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.  \nResults: \nIncontinence scores: 0 (0-5) v 0.5 (0-6) (p=NS) and proctitis \nscores: 0 (0-2) v 1.5 (0-5) (p<0.05), increased 6 weeks post-3D-\nCRT. There was no statistically significant change in anal canal \nmanometry, rectal volumes, anal\/rectal electrical sensitivity, \npudendal terminal motor latencies or the sonographic appearance \nof the sphincter on endo-anal ultrasound. \nConclusions: \nProctitis was seen six weeks after 3D-CRT. Changes in \nincontinence scores and anorectal physiology were not \ndemonstrated to a statistically significant degree. Though \nnumbers are still small, comparison to previous work suggests \nthat anorectal disturbance is less after 3D-CRT than conventional \nRT. Ongoing recruitment to this study should confirm this \nfinding. However, future dose escalation is planned and may \nresult in increased anorectal morbidity. \nReferences: \n1.

We report biochemical \noutcomes for the first 300 of these patients with a median follow \nup of 31m; range 16-66m. Patients were classified into low \n(49%), intermediate (37%), and high (14%) risk categories based \non their Gleason sum, presenting PSA, and clinical stage. Patients \nreceived either BXT alone (32%), BXT with 3m neoadjuvant \nandrogen deprivation (NAAD) (46%), or a combination of 3m \nNAAD, 45 Gy EBRT, and BXT (22%). \nResults \nProstate cancer survival was 100%; no deaths occurred with \nrising PSA. 16 patients (5.3%) experienced biochemical evidence \nof treatment failure (ASTRO definitio). Actuarial PSA free \nsurvival for all patients was 95% at 66m. There was no \nsignificant difference in actuarial survival in hormone-na\u00efve \n(95%) versus hormone-treated (94%) patients or between patients \nin different risk categories (low risk- 94%; intermediate risk- \n95%; high risk- 98%). At 3yr median PSA was 0.2 for all patients \n(n=81); 0.3 for low risk (n=36), 0.2 for intermediate risk (n=29), \nand 0.1 for high risk (n=16) groups. There was no significant \ndifference in median PSA at 3yr in hormone-na\u00efve (0.4) (n=27) \nversus hormone-treated (0.2) (n=54) patients. 65\/81 (80%) \npatients had a 3yr PSA \u22640.5. \nConclusion \nThese early results demonstrate the effectiveness of \nbrachytherapy in the treatment of early prostate cancer and \nsuggest that the excellent results achieved in the USA are \nreproducible in the UK. \n \n \nEffects of prostate brachytherapy on erectile function- \nprospective UK data \nSooriakumaran P,  Henderson A, Langley SEM, Laing RW. \nSt Luke\u2019s Cancer Centre, Royal Surrey County Hospital, \nGuildford, GU2 7XX \n \nIntroduction \nWe assess the effect of brachytherapy on potency in a \nprospective, patient administered questionnaire study. \nMethods \nPatients completed the International Index of Erectile Function \n(IIEF-5) prior to brachytherapy and at 6 weeks, 3,6,9,12,18 and \n24 months post implant. Men with an IIEF-5 score of <12\/25 \nwere considered to have moderate or worse ED and were classed \nas impotent.   \nResults \n180 patients completed baseline and >1 postimplant IIEF-5 \nquestionnaire; 45% (n=81) were potent pre-implant.  80% of \npotent patients maintained potency at last follow up (mean FU \n15m). For pre-implant potent patients, erectile function generally \nimproved over time: 6wk-48%; 3m-64%; 6m-53%; 9m-63%; \n12m-67%; 18m-61%; 24m-78%. \nConclusion \nErectile function generally improves with time post-\nbrachytherapy with >75% pre-implant potent patients \nmaintaining potency at 24 months. This compares favourably \nwith surgery, radiotherapy, and cryotherapy for the treatment of \nearly prostate cancer.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThromboprophylaxis for Radical Prostatectomy: A \nComparative Analysis of Present Practice between the USA, \nthe UK and Ireland. \nDavid J. Galvin, David Mulvin and David M. Quinlan \nDepartment of Urology, St. Vincents\u2019 University Hospital, \nUniversity College Dublin, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland. \n \nIntroduction \nA clinical dilemma exists in the management of patients \nundergoing radical prostatectomy whereby measures taken to \nreduce the risk of thrombotic events may adversely affect efforts \nto limit blood loss. No consensus exists in the literature on the \nideal management of thromboprophylaxis in these patients. Our \naim is to examine and compare current thromboprophylactic \npolicy and practice in centres performing radical prostatectomy. \nMethods \nA questionnaire was forwarded to all urology residency \nprogrammes in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United \nStates, regarding their current practice with respect to \nthromboprophylaxis in radical prostatectomy. Completed \nquestionnaires were returned by fax, and the data entered into a \ncomputer database. \nResults \nAn overall response rate of 60% was achieved. The \nquestionnaires demonstrated a significant difference in clinical \npractice between Urologists in the United States and the United \nKingdom. Just 24% of American Urologists use pharmacological \nthromboprophylaxis in contrast to 100% of British Urologists, yet \nthere is no difference in the incidence of reported thrombotic \nevents. There was no difference in the use of non-\npharmacological thromboprophylaxis.  Units performing the \nlargest number of radical prostatectomies do not use \npharmacological thromboprophylaxis, whereas units doing fewer \nprocedures do. \nConclusion \nThis study, which examines current clinical practice, \ndemonstrates that the units performing the greatest number of \nradical prostatectomies do not use thromboprophylaxis, although \nthe literature remains divided on this strategy. \n \n \nObesity, prior lower abdominal surgery and laparoscopic \nradical prostatectomy. \nT. Gianduzzo, C. Chang and C. Eden \nNorth Hampshire Hospital, Basingstoke. \n \nIntroduction:  \nObesity and previous lower abdominal surgery are both relative \ncontra-indications to laparoscopic pelvic surgery. However, \npatients exhibiting these features may gain more than most from \na laparoscopic approach due to the additional difficulty \nencountered in operating on them by open surgery (Chang, 2004; \nKatz, 2002). Increased experience with laparoscopic radical \nprostatectomy (LRP) has allowed us to test this hypothesis. \nMaterials and Methods:  \n350 cases of LRP were performed from March 2000 to July 004, \n111 using a transperitoneal and 239 using an extraperitoneal \nroute. 20 patients were classified as obese (>100 kg). 97 had \nlower abdominal scars due to unilateral hernia repair (n=48), \nbilateral hernia repair (n=14), appendisectomy (n=31) or other \nprocedures (n=4). Peri-operative and post-operative parameters \nwere recorded for all patients and compared to investigate \ndifferences. \n \n312\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nResults:  \nPatients\u2019 age, PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage and prostate \nvolume were similar. \nNon-obese & obese patients\u2019 mean values for operating time=195 \n& 183 min, blood loss=261 & 263 ml, complications=3.3% & \n5.0%, hospital stay=3.1 & 3.9 nights, + margins=15% & 15% and \nbiochemical recurrence=2.0 & 5.0%. \nMean values for patients without and with lower abdominal scars \nfor operating time=175 & 185 min, blood loss=243 & 240 ml, \ncomplications=4.4% & 2.9%, hospital stay=2.7 & 3.1 nights, + \nmargins=14% & 15% and biochemical recurrence=2.2 & 4.0%. \nConclusion:  \nNeither obesity nor a lower abdominal scar influenced any of the \nvariables (p>0.05) listed above. Obesity and previous lower \nabdominal surgery do not appear to have the same negative \nimpact on blood loss and operating time during LRP as has been \nreported during open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Obese \npatients and those with lower abdominal scars might be better \nserved by LRP than by ORP. \n \n \nProstate Cancer Screening in Ireland: A feasibility study \nGalvin DJ, Rea D, McDermott TED, Grainger R, Butler M, \nThornhill JA. \nAdelaide and Meath Hospital Incorporating the National \nChildren\u2019s Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin 24, Ireland. \n \nIntroduction \nThe true prevalence of prostate cancer is unknown in Ireland. Its \ndetection is currently low as no national screening programme \nexists. Randomised prostate cancer screening studies have \ndemonstrated reductions in cancer-specific mortality. In order to \nassess the validity and feasibility of prostate cancer screening in \nIreland, we developed two pilot prostate cancer screening \nprogrammes at our Institution. \nMethods \nThe first study invited men aged 18 to 66 years from a \nnationwide financial institution to attend for Men\u2019s Health \nScreening. The second study invited men from the general \npopulation between 40 and 70 years to attend for prostate cancer \nscreening. All men had a PSA taken and a DRE performed by a \nguided prostate biopsy (six-core) were a PSA > 4 ng\/ml or an \nabnormal DRE. \nResults \nComparison of Both Prostate Cancer Screening Trials \n STUDY 1 STUDY 2 \nTotal Subjects 677 969 \nn 468 969 \nMean Age 50.9 years 55.1 years \nMean PSA 1.2 ng\/ml 1.35 ng\/ml \nAbnormal DRE 26 (5.5%) 39 (4%) \nPSA >4ng\/ml 12 (2.56%) 44 (4.5%) \nTRUS Bx. 9 (1.9%) 34 (3.5%) \nCancer \nDetection 2 (0.42%) 13 (1.3%) \nRadiotherapy 0 8 \nRRP 2 5 \n \nConclusions \nThese two studies demonstrate the feasibility of prostate cancer \nscreening in Ireland. If screening is to be introduced on a national \nbasis, there are significant personnel and resource implications at \nboth primary care and hospital settings. \n \n \nMen\u2019s preferences for two different endocrine therapies in \nthe treatment of prostate cancer \nJenkins, VA. , Edginton TL, Fallowfield, LJ \nBrighton & Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex \n \nIntroduction \nAnti-androgen therapy and Lutenising Hormone Releasing \nHormone (LHRHa) have equivalent efficacy in the treatment of \nlocally advanced prostate cancer (Iversen et al 2000, J Urol, 164: \n1579 & See et al. 2002, J Urol, 168, 429-435), yet most clinicians \nprescribe LHRHa therapy.  Both of these treatments have \ndifferent side effect profiles impacting on men\u2019s quality of life. \nThey are also administered differently either by injection or \ntablets. Our survey examined preferences of healthy men and \nreasons for these when presented with the profiles of both drugs. \nMaterials and Methods \nScenarios describing side effect profiles of Drug A (LHRHa \ntreatment) and Drug B (anti-androgen therapy) were constructed \nand modified following expert feedback. A representative sample \nof 180 men without prostate cancer (68% over 65 years of age), \nread the scenarios and were asked to choose which drug \ntreatment they would prefer, with a reason for their choice. Also \nparticipants stated the degree to which they wanted to avoid side \neffects specific to each drug. \nResults \n156\/180 (86%) men choose anti-androgen therapy, the majority \n115\/156 wishing to avoid the side effects associated with \nLHRHa. 12 men chose LHRHa of whom 9\/12 cited the method \nof administration as the main reason for their choice. 12 men \ncould not decide. Examining which side effects men most wanted \nto avoid experiencing included, in descending order of \nimportance, risk of fractures (85%), reduced physical strength \n(76%), hot flushes (56%), decreased sexual interest (56%), \nimpotence (51%), breast enlargement (17%) and breast \ntenderness (13%). This did not differ significantly according to \nage, marital or socioeconomic status. \nConclusion \nAlthough this study has the limitations associated with \nhypothetical research in a non-clinical group, it showed a \ncompelling preference for anti-androgen therapy over LHRHa. \nFindings might encourage clinicians to present real patients with \nchoices in treatment when efficacy is equivalent and discuss side \neffects that will impact on quality of life. \n \n \nWho should perform trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided \nbiopsy of the prostate: Urologists or Radiologists? \nJames A Forster, Jonathan Krell, Philip M.T. Weston, Tony J \nBrowning, Kanwar Gill* and Subramanian Kanaga-Sundaram,  \nDepartments of Urology and Radiology*, Pinderfields General \nHospital, Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust,  \nAberford Road, Wakefield, West Yorkshire WF1 4DG.  \n \nIntroduction:  \nTrans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate is a \ncommon procedure, and its use is increasing with the advent of \nPSA. Screening for prostate cancer in the US has lead to over one \n313\nConsultant Urologist. Criteria for trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) \nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nmillion prostate biopsies being taken there every year. \nTraditionally in the UK radiology departments have provided this \nservice. The pressures of cancer waiting times and increasing \nwork-load have caused radiology departments difficulties in \nproviding optimal service. The decision as to whether urologists \nor radiologists perform the procedure varies according to local \npolicies and expertise. Although there is a good deal of data \npublished on technique, results and complications of the \nprocedure, to our knowledge there is no data comparing the \nresults gained by urology and radiology departments. That is the \npurpose of this study. \nMaterials and methods:  \nData of TRUS-guided prostate biopsy performed over a twelve \nmonth period commencing in January 2003 were retrospectively \nanalysed. The indication for the procedure including PSA value, \nspeciality of operator, number and position of cores and the \nhistology results were analysed.  The positive and negative \npredictive values of DRE, PSA and TRUS for each operator that \nresulted in a diagnosis of prostate cancer were calculated.  \nResults:  \nA total of 414 procedures were performed in the study period, \n283 by consultant urologists and the rest by a radiologist. The \ncohort of patients in each group had similar PSA levels. Overall \n175 biopsies were positive for prostate cancer (42%). The \nurologists had a positive biopsy rate of 41%; the radiologist had a \npositive biopsy rate of 44%. There was no statistical significance \nbetween the two groups (p=0.574). The positive predictive values \nof DRE performed by urologists were 59%, 75% and 37%. The \nnegative predictive values of DRE performed by urologists were \n67%, 60% and 81%. An elevated PSA (>4.0) gave a positive \npredictive value of 45%; a normal PSA (<4.1) gave a negative \npredictive value of 89%. Positive predictive value of TRUS was \n77%, 67% and 50% for the urologists, and 52% for the \nradiologist.  \nConclusion:  \nTRUS-guided prostate biopsy has a comparable yield of detecting \ncancer when performed by urologists and radiologists. With \nincreasing pressure on waiting time and the introduction of office \nurology, in the future it is appropriate that this procedure is \nperformed by adequately trained urologists. Our findings show \nthat our department has similar predictive values in methods used \nto diagnose prostate cancer compared with national and \ninternationally published data. \n \n \nCryotherapy for prostate cancer: Initial experience \nJ Cresswell, M Choudhary, S Asterling and D Greene \nDept of Urology, Sunderland Royal Hospital, Sunderland, UK \n \nIntroduction \nThe development of cryotherapy for localised prostate cancer \nprovides a potentially curative option for patients with primary or \nrecurrent disease, with reduced morbidity. We report the first 31 \nconsecutive patients treated at our centre. \nPatients and Methods \nData were collected prospectively for all patients. In 23 patients, \ncryotherapy was used as primary treatment, and as salvage \ntherapy in 7 previously treated with radiotherapy (6 EBRT, 1 \nbrachytherapy), and 1 following hormone treatment alone. All \nhad biopsy proven prostate cancer and negative bone scans. \nGleason grade was 7 or less in 25 patients and >7 in 5 patients \n(grade not recorded for 1 patient). Median PSA for primary \ntreatment was 9.1\u00b5g\/L (range 1.6 \u2013 25.4\u00b5g\/L) and 12.6\u00b5g\/L \n(range 2.5 \u2013 20.1\u00b5g\/L) for salvage cases. A single urologist \nperformed all treatments using an argon-based cryotherapy \nsystem with transrectal ultrasound. Median operative time was \n146 mins (range 109 \u2013 231 mins). A suprapubic catheter was \nplaced intra-operatively and remained in place for 2 weeks post-\noperatively. \nResults  \nAll patients tolerated the procedures well and median hospital \nstay was 3 days. Median follow up time was 3 months (range 2 \nwks \u2013 1 year). Of 23 patients with > 3 months follow-up, 17 \nreached a PSA nadir of <0.5\u00b5g\/L at 3 months. Of the patients \nundergoing primary treatment 5 failed to reach this nadir. Three \nout of 4 salvage treatments reached a PSA nadir of <0.5\u00b5g\/L at 3 \nmonths. Complications included 3 cases of urinary retention after \nremoval of suprapubic catheter with 2 patients requiring \nsubsequent TURP. Six patients developed urinary incontinence \nthat persisted for a median of 3 months and all 11 patients with \nnormal erections preoperatively, developed erectile dysfunction. \nNo patient developed a fistula.  \nConclusion \nPreliminary results suggest that cryotherapy offers a safe and \neffective alternative for the primary and secondary treatment of \nprostate cancer. Advantages include shorter hospital stay and \nlower morbidity compared to radical surgery. Long-term follow-\nup is required to assess the durability of response and therefore \nprobability of cure. \n \n \nProstate cancer in the over eighties - are we too aggressive? \nA. Mampitiya, D. Wijewardena, D.N. Wood, S.S. Gujral \nHarold Wood Hospital, Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS \nTrust, Romford, Essex \n \nIntroduction: \nPost-mortem studies in octogenarians reveal 60-80% prevalence \nof prostate adenocarcinoma(CaP) (Breslow N et al Int J Cancer \n1977; 20(5):680-8). Diagnosis of CaP in this age group does not \nsignificantly reduce life expectancy (Welch HG et al Ann Intern \nMed 1996; 124(6):577-84). However, there is still pressure to \ndiagnose and patients with CaP. Referral patterns and outcomes \nin these men were assessed. \nPatients and Methods: \nCase notes of octogenarians diagnosed with CaP at a single unit \nin 2001 were reviewed. Referral patterns, diagnostic criteria and \noutcomes were recorded. \nResults: \n143 octogenarians were referred for TRUS biopsies (35% of total \nbiopsy referrals): 63% by GPs for raised PSA (9 to 53ng\/ml), \n30% from the \u201cLUTS\u201d clinic (abnormal DRE) and 6% for \nhistological confirmation in clinically advanced disease. 77 had \nbiopsy proven CaP.  GPs did a DRE in 50%  - their findings \nshowed excellent correlation with those of urologists.  GP PSA \nindications were screening (42%), simple LUTS (52%) and  back \npain (6%). 57% had T2 staging. 61% had bone scans - only 12% \nbeing positive (all with T3+ disease). 75% had low to moderate \nGleason scores. Following counselling, 91% opted for immediate \nhormonal manipulation, 8% watchful waiting and 1 patient chose \nradical radiotherapy. At two years, there was a 30% recorded \nmortality, only 6% were CaP related. \nConclusion \nDespite a known high prevalence of indolent CaP in \noctogenarians, many have PSA tests performed in the community \nwhich could sensibly be avoided if prior counseling were \nemployed. Abnormal results lead to anxiety (often fuelled by the \nmedia) and subsequent urological referral for further assessment. \n314\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAt this stage even with comprehensive counselling many of these \nmen opt for active therapy on diagnosis rather than watchful \nwaiting despite little evidence regarding survival or quality of life \nbenefits.

Cornes, M. T. Vandal, S.S. Gujral \nDepartment of Urology, Harold Wood Hospital, Romford, UK \n \nIntroduction \nSpecialist nurses have an established role in the management of \nUrological cancer in helping patients to understand their disease \nand treatment options, and in offering counselling and emotional \nsupport. There is evidence to suggest that patients who see the \nnurse specialist express more satisfaction and have less anxiety \nthan those who see either a male or female junior doctor \n(Hammond C. Dissertation, University of Surrey, 1994). Other \nstudies have found that the specialist nurses\u2019 clinical expertise \ncompared favourably with that of other clinicians (Garvican et \nal., BMJ. 1998; 316 (7136): 976-7). The nurse specialists also \nprovide unbiased counselling. This study describes patient \nsatisfaction with Uro-oncology nurse specialists and their nurse \nled clinics. \nMethods \nOne hundred, 15 point, patient satisfaction questionnaires were \nsent to new and existing patients with urological cancer who had \nbeen randomly identified by the Uro-oncology nurse specialist. \nThe questions were mainly concerned with the provision of \ninformation to patients and with the satisfaction of the nurse \nspecialist service. \nResults \n70 patients completed and returned the questionnaires. 73% of \npatients were over 70 years of age. 88% of patients were male. \n94% of patients were Caucasian in background. 11% of patients \nsaw the nurse specialist at diagnosis and 17% immediately after \ndiagnosis. 76% found this consultation beneficial. 47% of \npatients felt it would be more beneficial to see the clinical nurse \nspecialist before they saw the consultant. 79% of patients \nreceived information on their disease and treatment in verbal \nformat, 15% received both verbal and written information and \n1% received written information only. 55% of the patients \nreceived this information from the nurse specialist.  81% of these \npatients found the information very useful and 84% of patients \nfound this information easy to understand. 90% of patients said \nthey had adequate opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns \nwith the nurse specialist and 93% were given a contact number \nfor later use if required. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDifficult to contact 2 Unhelpful 0 \nNot enough contact 1 Considerate 42 \nCrucial to my \nrecovery \n10 Supportive 39 \nPromoted \nindependence \n2 Professional 46 \nEasy to contact 32 Condescending 0 \nBossy 0 Rushed 0 \nFriendly 51 Invaluable 25 \nWonderful 12 Poor 1 \nAdequate 1 Informative 39 \nSensitive 24 Irrelevant 0 \nTable 1: Outlines words, which describe the care patients \nreceived from the Uro-oncology nurse specialist \nConclusion \nPatients found contact with the Uro-oncology nurse specialist \nsupportive, informative and beneficial to their treatment. Patients \nseem undecided whether they should see the nurse specialist \nbefore or after the consultant. We feel that raising the profile of \nthe Uro-oncology nurse specialist would be beneficial to patient \ntreatment and care.  \n \n \nwww; the wild, wild web: Internet usage in patients with \nurological cancer in 2004 \nJ. Masood, J. Shahzad, T.A. Ghazali, M. T. Vandal, S.S. Gujral \nDepartment of Urology, Harold Wood Hospital, Romford,  \nEssex, UK \n \nIntroduction \nThe Internet has an enormous number of health related web sites \nand can be a valuable source of medical information to the public \nand health professionals. Patients can independently search the \nInternet to learn about their illness and treatment options. There is \nevidence to suggest that there is a better outcome in patients who \nare well informed. However, of concern, is the quality of some \ninformation available on the \u201cNet\u201d. Some Internet sites may \ncontain erroneous information on cancer that can pose problems. \nWe assess Internet usage and its benefit amongst our patients \nwith urological cancer. We also assess if patients are advised to \nvisit particular sites on the \u201cNet\u201d by health professionals \nMethods \nAll patients attending our outpatient clinic in 2004 with any type \nof urological cancer were asked to complete a 10-point \nquestionnaire. We assessed their use of the Internet to gain \ninformation about their cancer and if they were advised to look at \nany web sites by health professionals. Patients were asked if they \ncould name any of the web sites they may have visited, if these \nsites were useful in improving their understanding of the disease \nand whether, the information they gathered helped them to make \na more informed decision about the further management of their \ncancer.  \nResults \nA total of 170 completed questionnaires were evaluated. These \nincluded 139 males (mean age 69years; range 52 - 86years) and \n31 females (mean age 71 years; range 62 -81 years) in the cohort. \n98% of patients said they had discussed their cancer with a health \n315\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nprofessional. Only 42 patients (24%) had direct access to the \nInternet. Of the others, 36% had access via friends\/family. Only \n11 patients (6%) were advised to visit specific websites and all \nwere advised to do so by the Uro-oncology nurse specialists. \nOnly 20 patients (11%) in total had visited urology cancer web \nsites. Only 2 patients could recall the web sites they had visited. \nAll patients who visited websites found them either \u201cuseful\u201d or \n\u201cvery useful\u201d, and stated learning about staging, prognosis of \ntheir disease and complications of surgery and alternative \ntreatment therapies. Not surprisingly, younger patients, males, \npatients of higher social class and those with direct access to a \ncomputer were more likely to use the Internet \nConclusion \nWe found that only 11% of patients with urological cancer in our \ncohort have used the Internet, and they found this resource very \nuseful. Although Internet usage amongst the general urological \npatient population appears to be on the increase, (Hellawell et al., \nBJU Int. 2000; 86(3): 191-4) patients with cancer tend to be older \nand may not have the facilities or the know-how to use the \nInternet. Health professionals are counselling too few patients \nabout urological cancer websites. Urologists and nurse specialists \nshould be made aware of the need to familiarize themselves with \nurological websites. Evidence that computer generated \ninformation systems are superior to written and verbal \ninformation exists (Bulmer et al., BJU Int. 2001; 88(6): 532-5).  \nWe advocate visual (using the internet during consultation) and \nverbal counselling of these patients. Patients can then be directed \nto high-quality sites so that they can educate themselves about \ntheir cancer and avoid misleading websites. \n \n \nCYP1B1 expression is higher in the peripheral zone compared \nto the transition zone: a difference underlying zonal \nsusceptibility to prostate adenocarcinoma? \nNarasimhan Ragavan1,2,4, Rebecca Hewitt4, Andrew C. Hindley2, \nCaroline M. Nicholson3, Shyam S. Matanhelia1,  \nFrancis L. Martin4 \nDepartments of Urology1, Oncology2 and Pathology3, Lancashire \nTeaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Department of Biological \nSciences4, Lancaster University, Lancaster. UK \n \nIntroduction  \nThe prostate is a composite organ divided into zones.  Prostate \nadenocarcinoma (CaP) mostly occurs in the peripheral zone.  \nCytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes are constitutively \nexpressed and inducible enzymes, many of which (e.g. CYP1A1, \nCYP1A2 and CYP1B1 isoforms) are involved in hormone and \ncarcinogen hydroxylation. \nAim \nTo assess variations in CYP expression in the prostate on an intra- \n(peripheral zone Vs. transition zone) and inter-individual basis. \nMaterials and Methods  \nHuman prostates (n=24) were obtained, with ethical approval, \nfrom radical retropubic prostatectomies.  Study participants \nexhibited low PSA (< 20 \u00b5g\/l serum) and low volume of disease \n(< two\/eight core biopsies positive for CaP).  Following \nresection, tissue sets consisting of peripheral zone and transition \nzone were isolated from a lobe pre-operatively identified as \nnegative for CaP.  A histopathologist always examined adjacent \ntissue.  Real-time RT-PCR was employed to quantitatively \nexamine CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1. \nResults \nCYP1A1 mRNA transcripts were detected in either or both zones \nof twenty tissue sets (in seven cases, in both zones) and were \nundetectable in four others.  In eleven tissue sets, higher levels of \nCYP1A1 expression were observed in the peripheral zone \ncompared to the transition zone (maximum six-fold difference) \nwhereas in nine other tissue sets this relationship (maximum 2.5-\nfold difference) was reversed.  CYP1A2, although detectable in \ntwelve tissue sets, was not quantifiably expressed.  CYP1B1 \nexpression was detected in both zones of all tissue sets examined.  \nInter-individual variation in CYP1B1 expression levels in \nperipheral zone (five-fold differences) and transition zone (ten-\nfold differences) were noted.  In sixteen out of seventeen tissue \nsets found to be cancer free, CYP1B1 expression was found to be \ntwo- to fifty-fold higher in the peripheral zone compared to the \ntransition zone; in the remaining tissue set an equal level of gene \nexpression was detected in both zones.  In the tissue sets \ncontaining CaP, CYP1B1 expression was higher in the cancerous \nzone (be it peripheral or transition) in five of six cases; in another \ntissue set containing PIN, an equal level of gene expression was \nagain detected in both zones.  Immunohistochemistry clearly \ndemonstrated a nuclear staining pattern for CYP1B1 in epithelial \nand stromal cells of both zones; the staining density of this \nprotein was markedly elevated in cancerous tissue. \nDiscussion  \nCYP1B1 preferentially catalyses the 4-hydroxylation of 17\u03b2-\noestradiol, metabolically activates exogenous pro-carcinogens \nand inactivates anticancer agents.  Future studies will investigate \nwhether CYP1B1 may be employed as a target either for \nchemoprevention strategies or treatment of clinically invasive \ndisease. \n \nThe Economic Consequences of Prostate Cancer in the UK. \nN Ragavan, VK Sangar, SS Matanhelia, ME Watson, RA Blades \nDepartment of Urology, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS \nTrust, Preston, UK \n \nIntroduction  \nThe incidence of prostate cancer is increasing due to heightened \npatient awareness and the availability of PSA testing. There is \nlittle data available on the impact of this disease on the UK health \ncare economy. Availability of such data is necessary for the \nadequate direction of resources. The aim of this study was to \nassess the economic impact of prostate cancer  \nMethod \nAll the new prostate cancers diagnosed in 2001-2002 were \nidentified from BAUS section of oncology database. \nCorresponding patients were identified from the local hospital \ndatabase to facilitate calculation of indirect costs. \nThe Total Cost (TC) of diagnosing, treating and following up \npatients for five years was estimated as the sum of Direct Costs \n(DC) (NHS) and Indirect Costs (IC) (loss of earnings).  \nResults  \nIn the period studied there were 15099 newly diagnosed prostate \ncancers (mean age 72.3y) The treatments for these prostate \ncancer patients were radical prostatectomy (RRP) (n=1506), \nradical radiotherapy (RRT) (n=2735), hormone therapy (n=7127) \nand chemotherapy (n=18). There were 1320 patients for whom no \ntreatment was available from the database so they were assumed \nto be on active monitoring. 1065 patients were entirely excluded \nfrom the calculation as the treatments they received were not \nclear. \nThe TC for the diagnosis, treatment and five-year follow up of \nprostate cancer patients diagnosed during 2001 \u2013 2002 was \nestimated at \u00a3 92.74 million  \n(Cost in \u00a3 Millions \u2013 Watchful waiting -1.8, Hormones 63.1, \nRRP-12.5, RRT-12.4 \n316\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nChemo - 0.02, TURP1.9). The expenditure on hormonal therapy \naccounted for over two-thirds of the TC. The TC of radical \nradiotherapy and radical prostatectomy were similar, but almost \none and half times more patients were treated with radical \nradiotherapy than with prostatectomy. The average cost of \ntreatment of a prostate cancer patient was \u00a3 7294. \nThe direct costs, which imply the burden directly borne by the \nNational Health Service, form the greater proportion of the total \ncost (97.6%)  \nConclusion  \nThe management of prostate cancer has a significant impact on \nthe health care budget. Cost effective treatment options without \ncompromising the quality of care (e.g. orchidectomy) need to be \nrevisited. \n \nExpression and Differential Modulation of Adiponectin \nReceptors in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines \nT Mistry1,2, E Karteris1, J Digby1, J Chen1, K Desai2, \nH.S. Randeva1 \n1Biomedical Research Institute, Department of Biological \nSciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, and \n2Department of Urology, University Hospitals Coventry and \nWarwickshire NHS Trust, Clifford Bridge Road, Coventry CV2 \n2DX \n \nIntroduction \nAdiponectin is an adipocytokine that has been shown to have \nanti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory actions, and has been \nimplicated in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant states such as \nobesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adiponectin orchestrates its \nactions by activating two membrane receptors (adipo-R1\/R2) that \ndespite possessing a classic seven transmembrane structure, have \ncharacteristics distinct from any known G-protein receptor. \nRecent studies have shown that adiponectin levels are \nsignificantly decreased in women with endometrial and breast \ncancer, other hormone-dependent cancers. To date, little is known \nabout the role of adiponectin receptors in prostate cancer, the \nprogression of which is positively correlated with obesity and \nhyperinsulinaemic states. Therefore, we hypothesised that there \nmight be a direct link between insulin-resistant states and prostate \ncancer, via adiponectin receptors. In this study we aim to \ninvestigate in detail the expression of adiponectin receptors in \nprostate cancer cell lines, and the influence of various hormones \nand growth factors on their expression.  \nMaterials and Methods \nExpression of adiponectin receptors was determined using RT-\nPCR, sequencing analysis, Western blotting analysis and \nimmunohistochemistry in two different cell prostate cancer cell \nlines, PC-3 (androgen independent) and LNCaP (androgen-\ndependent). RT-PCR and Western blotting were also used to \ninvestigate the regulation of adiponectin receptor expression by \nvarious hormones and growth factors. \nResults  \nAdipo-R1 and adipo-R2 were detected in both PC-3 and LNCaP \ncell lines at mRNA and protein level using RT-PCR and Western \nblotting. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed membrane \nlocalisation of both receptors. Down-regulation of adipo-R1 was \nfound in response to TNF-\u03b1 and dexamethasone in the cell lines \nstudied, whereas testosterone caused down-regulation of both \nreceptors. Growth hormone and \u03b2-estradiol had no effect on \nreceptor subtype expression. \n \nConclusion \nIn this study we demonstrate for the first time the expression of \nadiponectin receptors in prostate cancer cell lines, suggesting that \nadiponectin can exert effects at the prostate level, acting in an \nendocrine\/paracrine manner. Furthermore, we provide novel \nevidence about the differential regulation of these receptors by \nhormones, steroids and glucocorticoids. Further studies are \nrequired to investigate the potential role of adiponectin and its \nreceptors in the aetiopathogenesis of prostate cancer and its \nrelationship to the hyperinsulinaemic state. \n \n \nEmergency bilateral orchidectomy \u2013a life saving procedure in \nurological emergencies (apart from paraplegia) caused by \ncarcinoma prostate \nMakarand V Khochikar \nSiddhi Vinayak Ganapati Cancer Hospital, Miraj (India) \n \nIntroduction  \nAcute paraplegia due to spinal cord compression in a case of \nmetastatic prostate cancer is an oncological emergency. \nUsefulness of bilateral orchidectomy in this situation is very well \nproven. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), \nintractable hematuria, anuria due to ureteric obstruction, raised \nintracranial tension (ICT) with convulsions, acute breathlessness \ndue to pulmonary metastasis are few other oncological \nemergencies in case of advanced \/metastatic prostate cancer. \nOperative risk in these cases is very high. Effectiveness of \nbilateral orchidectomy in these situations is evaluated in this \nstudy. \nMaterials and Methods  \nDuring 1998-2004, 14 cases of advanced\/metastatic prostate \ncancer with above-mentioned emergencies were dealt with. These \nwere-disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-7 cases, \nanuria due to ureteric obstruction-3 cases, raised ICT with \nconvulsions \u20131case,acute breathlessness due extensive pulmonary \nmetastsis-1 case and intractable hematuria \u20132 cases. Emergency \nbilateral orchidectomy was performed under local anaesthesia  in \nall these cases. \nResults  \nBilateral orchidectomy was found to be extremely effective in all \nthese cases. DIC and intractable hematuria could turn to \nnormalcy within 72 hours, ureteric obstruction could open up \nwithin 48 hours, breathlessness could revert to stable respiratory \nstatus over 72hours and raised ICT could normalize within 4 \ndays. \nConclusion \nAdvanced \/metastatic prostatic cancer can manifest with \noncological emergencies that need prompt \/active treatment. \nBilateral orchidectomy proves life saving in these situations, even \nin cases of DIC and acute respiratory failure where operative risk \nis higher. \n \n \nAn elevated PSA, which normalises does not exclude the \npresence of prostate cancer \nBoddy JLa, Pike DJb, Al-Hayek Sa, and Malone PRa \naThe Harold Hopkins Department of Urology, Royal Berkshire \nHospital, Reading, United Kingdom \nbDepartment of Applied Statistics, The University of Reading, \nReading, United Kingdom \n \n \n \n317\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nIntroduction:  \nPatients with an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level are \nknown to have an increased risk of harbouring prostate cancer \n(Stamey et al. N Engl J Med 1987; 317(15): 909-16). However, \nrecent work has shown that a significant proportion of patients \nfound to have an elevated PSA, will have a normal value if it is \nrepeated (Eastham et al. JAMA 2003; 289(20): 2695-700). What \nis uncertain is how this relates to the presence of prostate cancer. \nThe current study looks to address this issue by determining the \nincidence of cancer in patients who have an elevated referral \nPSA, which subsequently falls to within the normal range.  \nMaterials and Methods:  \nA prospective study was conducted in men undergoing a prostate \nbiopsy following the finding of an elevated PSA, according to \ntheir age-specific reference range (40-49 years 0-2.5ng\/ml, 50-59 \nyears 0-3.5ng\/ml, 60-69 years 0-4ng\/ml, 70-79 0-6.5ng\/ml). Prior \nto the procedure a urological history, urine dipstick and repeat \nPSA test were performed and the results of a prostate \nexamination recorded. The referral and repeat PSA value were \nthen compared and related to the subsequent histology.  \nResults:  \n21 of the 160 (13%) study patients had a repeat PSA level which \nhad fallen back to within the normal age-specific reference range. \n5 of these 21 (24%) patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, \n3 of these patients had a suspicious digital rectal examination \n(DRE) before the procedure but 2 had a normal prostate \nexamination.  \nConclusion:  \nThis study clearly demonstrates that just because the PSA \nnormalises before the biopsy procedure does not mean that the \npresence of prostate cancer can be excluded, even if the prostate \nfeels benign.  \n \n \nHow are prostate biopsies performed in the United Kingdom \nand the Republic of Ireland? \nAl-Hayek S, Malone PR, Boddy JL \nRoyal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK \n \nIntroduction: \nAlthough prostate biopsy is the procedure of choice in diagnosing \nprostate cancer, it is not standardized. The aim of this study is to \nexplore the current practice of obtaining prostate biopsies in the \nNHS units around UK and Republic of Ireland. \nMaterials and Methods: \nPostal questionnaire was sent to 340 members of the British \nAssociation of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) working at 187 \nNHS hospitals. BAUS members\u2019 handbook 2002\/2004 provided \ncontact details.  This covered the 21 regions specified in the \nurology book 1998 for United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. \nThe questionnaire detailed the following information; the grade \nand speciality of the operator, biopsy indications, pre biopsy \npreparations, counselling about complications, the number of \nbiopsies taken, use of antibiotics, local anaesthetic, analgesia, \nhow and when the pathology results are given to patients.  \nResults: \nOverall response rate was 61%. Urologists performed 65% of the \nprostate biopsies whereas 22% were undertaken by radiologists \nand 24% were shared. The majority (76%) used age based PSA \nvalues at which prostate biopsy deemed to be indicated, however, \nthe age related values varied. The number of biopsies taken \nranged from 2 to 24 samples. Aspirin was stopped in 34% of \npatients prior to the procedure in comparison to Clopidogrel \nwhich was stopped in 49%. Interestingly, large minority (41%) \ndid not use any sort of analgesia before taking the biopsy. \nAlthough the vast majority (96%) gave patients prophylaxis \nantibiotics, numerous (43) different combinations of antibiotics \nwere prescribed.  \nConclusion: \nAs a gold standard method of diagnosing a very common and \nimportant cancer, prostate biopsy does not follow the same \nguidelines in different NHS trusts. A national study comparing \nthe pick up rate and patients\u2019 satisfaction is needed to clarify the \nrequirements for a safe, comfortable and diagnosing biopsy.  \n \n \nProtocol for use of Zoledronic Acid in men with Hormone \nRefractory Prostate Cancer \nDr.David Dodds, Dr.Martin Russell \nBeatson Oncology Centre, Western Infirmary, Glasgow \n \nSkeletal related events are frequent and debilitating events in \nHormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC).  Treatment of \nthese events can account for as much as 50% of the total \ntreatment costs of an individual with prostate cancer (Groot, M.T, \net al. Eur.  Urol.2003;43:226-232) Zoledronic acid has been \nshown to reduce skeletal related events in men suffering from \nhormone independent prostate cancer (Saad et al. J. Natl Cancer \nInst.2002;94:1458-1468, Lipton A et al. Cancer \nInvest.2002;20:45-55.).  These include pathological fractures, \nepisodes of hypercalcaemia and need for palliative radiotherapy.  \nThere is also an improvement in pain control and quality of life.  \nNo other bisphosponate has been shown to do this. \nQuestions remain regarding optimal timing of introduction of the \ndrug and also how long treatment should be continued.  The \nquestion of integration of Zoledronic acid with other existing \nsupportive and palliative therapies is also unclear at present.  The \nfollowing document is an attempt to offer practical solutions to \nsome of these issues utilising the available data as well as \ndepartmental experience gained with the drug over the last year. \nExisting recommendations\/treatment algorithm are based on the \nThird International Consultation on Prostate Cancer, June 21-23: \n2002  \nThe Scottish Medicines Consortium summary on the proposal for \nintroduction of Zoledronic Acid in hormone refractory metastatic \nprostate cancer states that there is \u201ca reduction in skeletal related \nevents compared to placebo\u201d It was the opinion of the SMC that \nthis risk reduction of 36% for the first skeletal related event and \n40% for the second event on multi-event analysis was insufficient \nto allow introduction of Zoledronic acid into standard practice. \nIn the light of the SMC decision and the evidence quoted, the \nBOC has drawn up the following protocol for Zoledronic acid use \nin HRPC in an attempt to standardise treatment within the \ndepartment and to try to target therapy to those most likely to \nbenefit. \nReferences: \n1.

Gommersall, Henry S.O. Coulter, Asad Abedin, \nDonna M. Peehl, Alan P. Doherty, Nicholas D. James and  \nMoray J. Campbell, \n \nIntroduction \nProstate epithelial cells express a broad complement of nuclear \nreceptors including not only the androgen receptor but others \nwhich have an overt role is sensing nutrient and xenobiotic \nfactors. For example, normal prostate epithelial cells are acutely \nsensitive to the antiproliferative action of several micro and \nmacro nutrients such as the active forms of vitamins A and D. \nOften prostate cancer cell lines and primary cultures display \nsuppressed sensitivity to these factors. We hypothesized that \nepigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer cells suppress the \nability of anti-mitotic nuclear receptors to transactivate key \nantiproliferative target genes thereby resulting in insensitivity to \nenvironmental signals. To dissect these relationships we have \nfocussed on the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) and peroxisome \nproliferator activated receptors (PPAR). \nMaterials and Methods \nIn silico and in vitro protocols measured receptor levels, for \nexample quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR (Q-RT-\nPCR) to measure PPAR and VDR mRNA levels and three known \nassociated co-repressors (NCoR1, NCoR2\/SMRT and Alien). \nNormal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), cancer cell lines (LNCaP, \nPC-3 and DU-145) and primary cultures of prostate cancer (n = \n12) and normal peripheral zone (n = 8) were examined. \nReceptor\/co-repressor complexes were targeted with histone \ndeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, either sodium butyrate (NaB), \nTrichostatin A (TSA) or Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid \n(SAHA) in combination with nuclear receptor ligand. Parallel \nstudies used siRNA approaches. The effects of these treatments \nwere explored by proliferation and apoptosis studies, microarray \napproaches and target gene regulation by Q-RT-PCR.  \nResults \nWe found in silico that normal prostate epithelial cells express a \nrich compliment of at least 14 nuclear receptors, including FXR, \nLXR\u001f and ERR\u001f which provide a hitherto unsuspected local \nnutrient-sensing capacity.  Cancer cell lines and primary cancer \ncultures frequently expressed significantly elevated \nNCoR2\/SMRT levels, which correlated with reduced \nantiproliferative sensitivity for example to the VDR ligand \n1,25(OH)2D3. Thus 8\/12 primary tumour samples had elevated \nNCoR2\/SMRT mRNA levels (mean 4.2 fold increase); generally \nNCoR1 and Alien were infrequently elevated (3\/12 and 2\/12 \nrespectively). Furthermore the antiproliferative action of a wide \nrange of nuclear receptor ligands can be dramatically and \nsignificantly enhanced by co-treatments of ligand plus low doses \nof either NaB, TSA of SAHA. Interestingly cell fates differed. \nThus treatments of 1 \uf02c25(OH)2D3  plus HDACi induced apoptosis, \nwhereas PPAR\u03b3 ligands plus HDACi resulted in type II \n(autophagic) non-apoptotic programmed cell death.  cDNA \nmicroarray and gene expression studies confirmed the unique and \nsignificant up regulation of a number of antiproliferative target \ngenes including MAPK-APK2 and GADD45 alpha. Supportively \nprimary cancer cultures with elevated NCoR2\/SMRT \ndemonstrated suppressed GADD45 alpha induction compared to \nmatched normal controls. Subsequently we knocked-down \nNCoR2\/SMRT levels in PC-3 cells using siRNA resulting in a \n95% reduction in the basal levels of SMRT mRNA after 72 hr, \nand found that GADD45 alpha induction by 1,25(OH)2D3  alone \nbecame very significantly enhanced \n \nConclusions \nThese data demonstrate that the nuclear receptor co-repressor \nNCoR2\/SMRT is commonly elevated in prostate cancer cells and \ndrives transcriptional and therefore cellular insensitivity to a \nbroad portfolio of nuclear receptor ligands. Individual molecular \ndiagnostic profiling of early stage cancers will highlight \nindividuals who would respond to targeting the co-repressor \ncomplex either through pharmacological or nutritional \nintervention.  \n \nNovel anticancer properties of pomegranate extracts; \nsuppression of proliferation, invasion and xenograft growth \nof human prostate cancer cells \nLyndon M.

To evaluate \nchanges in the gene expression profile following extract \nstimulation, we performed real-time RT-PCR studies. In vitro cell \ninvasion assays and xenograft experiments were performed to test \nthe influence of pomegranate extracts on cell invasion and \nmetastasis. \nResults \nOil, W and P all acutely inhibited in vitro proliferation of LNCaP, \nPC-3 and DU 145 cancer cell lines. The dose of P required to \ninhibit cell proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP by \n50% (ED50) was 70 micro g\/ml, whereas normal prostate \nepithelial cells (hPrEC) were significantly less affected (ED50 250 \n\u001fg\/ml).  \nThese effects were mediated by changes in both cell cycle \ndistribution and induction of apoptosis. For example, the \nandrogen independent cells DU 145 cells showed significant \nincrease from 11% to 22% in G2\/M cells (p<0.05) by treatment \nwith Oil (35 micro g\/ml) with a modest induction of apoptosis. In \nother cell line and treatment combinations the apoptotic response \npredominated, for example PC-3 cells treated with P. These \ncellular effects coincided with rapid changes in mRNA levels of \ngene targets. Thus, 4 hr treatment of DU 145 cells with Oil (35 \nmicro g\/ml) resulted in significant 2.3 fold upregulation of the \ncyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1\/cip1) (p<0.01) and 0.6 \nfold downregulation of c-myc (p<0.05).  In parallel, all agents \npotently suppressed PC-3 invasion through Matrigel, and \nfurthermore P and supercritical CO2 extracted pomegranate seed \noil (S) demonstrated potent inhibition of PC-3 xenograft growth \nin athymic mice.  \nConclusions \nOverall this study demonstrates significant in vitro and in vivo \nantitumor activity of pomegranate-derived materials against \nhuman prostate cancer. \n319\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nThe potential use of Kerr gated Raman spectroscopy to \ndiagnose prostate cancer. \nHart Prieto M. C, Crow P, Matousek P*, Parker A. W*,  \nWright M, Ritchie A. W, Stone N. \nGloucestershire Royal Hospital \n*Central Laser Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory \n \nIntroduction: \nRaman spectroscopy is an optical technique that is able to \ninterrogate biological tissues. In doing so it gives us an \nunderstanding of the changes in the molecular structure that is \nassociated with disease development. The Kerr gating Technique \nuses a picosecond pulsed laser as well as fast temporal gating of \ninelastically (Raman) scattered light. The scattered light is \ncollected at various time delays following the laser pulse. In \nutilising these techniques it was felt that Raman spectroscopy \ncould be used to not only distinguish between pathologies within \nthe prostate gland, but also to depth profile the prostate gland \nthereby increasing their potential use in vivo. \nMaterials and Methods: \nThe samples used for this study were taken following fully \ninformed consent and ethical approval. Prostate samples were \nobtained by taking a chip at TURP. The samples were then snap \nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to an -80\u00b0C freezer for \nstorage. The samples were passively warmed and then scanned \non an Optimised Raman System (Renishaw System 1000), to \nobtain in vitro Raman spectra. The prostate sample was placed \nonto a cell containing urea and then scanned. The Kerr gating \nsystem is based on the high throughput 4 picosecond optical Kerr \nshutter that was described in previous publications by Matousek \net al (1, 2), and was used for depth profiling. \nResults: \nThe spectra obtained as we go through the prostate gland tissue \nand on to the urea cell, clearly show the change in the spectra. \nThe first 3 spectra are clearly tissue spectra with peaks at \n1445cm-1 and 1650cm-1, which are consistent with protein \npeaks. The 4th spectrum has lost a lot of the signal and then in the \nfollowing spectra the urea peak is clearly seen at 1003cm-1, and \nthere is a loss of the protein peaks that are consistent with tissue. \nConclusion: \nWe have shown for the first time that we are able to obtain \nspectra from different depths through the prostate gland. This has \nmajor implications in the future of Raman spectroscopy as a tool \nfor diagnosis. Up until now we have been able to distinguish \nbetween different pathologies within the prostate gland by \nsampling the tissue in vitro. This involves only looking at the \nsurface of the sample. The prostate gland is usually biopsied via \nthe rectum. This is a painful procedure and can give false \nnegatives. With the help of Raman spectroscopy and Kerr gating \nwe potentially would be able to pick up the spectral differences \nfrom a small focus of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland in an \notherwise benign gland. \nReferences: \n1.

Advances in \nsoftware design have led to the development of intraoperative \ndosimetry planning allowing radioactive seed implantation to be \nperformed without the need for a separate volume study and \npreoperative planning. We report our initial clinical results and \ndosimetry data using the Bard Proseed technique for I125 seed \nimplantation in a consecutive series of 55 patients.  \nMethod \nFrom May 2002 patients with clinically localised prostate cancer \nopting for brachytherapy were prospectively assessed \npreoperatively, with International Prostate Symptom Score \n(IPSS), sexual dysfunction score (SDS) and uroflowmetry. \nPatients were started on tamsulosin before implantation. \nBrachytherapy was performed under general anaesthesia \naccording to the Bard Proseed technique. The urethral catheter \nwas removed on completion of the procedure. The patient was \ndischarged the following day when satisfactory voiding was \nachieved. Patients were followed up with PSA, IPSS, SDS and \nflow rate tests 3 monthly intervals for the first year, and \nsubsequently at 6 monthly intervals thereafter. A CT scan of the \nprostate was performed 6 weeks after the implant in order to \ncalculate post-implant dosimetry. \nResults \n55 patients (clinical stage T1c to T2c) with a mean age of 63 \nyears (range 52 \u2013 77) underwent treatment. The mean prostate \nvolume was 38cc (range 14 \u2013 88cc) The mean PSA fell from a \npre-implant level of 7.8ug\/L to 1.8, 1.3, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.8ug\/L at 3, \n6, 9, 12 and 18 months respectively. The mean pre-implant IPSS \nof 6.9 rose to 15 three months after implantation and \nsubsequently subsided to 11.9, 10.6, 6 and 5.8 at 6, 9, 12 and 18 \nmonths respectively. The mean pre-implant SDS of 24 changed \nto 15.8, 22, 24.1, 24.8 and 24.6 at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months \nrespectively.   Three patients required a catheter for longer than 2 \nweeks and 2 of these have subsequently resumed satisfactory \nvoiding. No patient has yet required a TURP. Only one patient \nhas developed significant (Grade 2) rectal toxicity.  \nAll patients achieved the prescribed intraoperative (160Gy) and \npostoperative (140Gy) minimum dose to 90% of the prostate \n(D90). Mean doses achieved were 192 and 175Gy respectively. \nNo patient exceeded the maximum intraoperative  dose to 30% of \nthe urethral volume (Urethral D30). The mean postoperative \nUrethral D30 was 229Gy, with 16 patients exceeding the \nproscribed limit. However has not been reflected in increased \nurinary symptoms in this group. \nConclusion \nProstate brachytherapy using the Bard Proseed technique has \nachieved excellent dosimetric results in all patients with a \npredictable fall in PSA to a nadir after 12 months.  Urinary \nsymptoms are universally increased following the implantation, \nbut return to the pre-implant level by one year. Rectal toxicity is \nnegligible. \n \n \nNovel Prenylation Inhibition in Prostate Cancer In Vitro. \nRichard Khafagy1,3 2 1\nBrown1, Noel Clarke1,3 \n1ProMPT Genito Urinary Cancer Research Group, Cancer \nResearch UK, Paterson Institute, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, \nManchester, UK. \n2AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK \n3Department of Urology, Hope Hospital, Salford Royal Hospitals \nNHS Trust, Manchester,  \n, Trevor Stephens , Claire Hart , Mick \n320\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nIntroduction: \nThere is a requirement for novel chemotherapeutic agents in the \nprevention or treatment of bone metastases in prostate cancer. \nAZD3409 is a novel oral ras protein prenyl transferase inhibiting \nboth the Farnesyl Transferase pathway and the Geranylgeranyl \nescape pathway, with significant theoretical advantages over \nexisting prenylation inhibitors.  \nMaterials and Methods:  \nThe anti-proliferative effect of escalating doses of AZD3409 on \nmalignant PC-3 and LNCaP and non-malignant PNT2-C2 cell \nlines were tested in culture. Proliferation of isolated primary \nprostate epithelial cells from patients undergoing TURP was also \nquantified. PC-3 and PNT2-C2 cell colony formation was \nmeasured in co-culture using long-term human bone marrow \nstroma in the presence of escalating doses of AZD3409.  The \neffect of AZD3049 on prostatic cellular invasion through \nmatrigel (synthetic basement membrane) and through a cultured \nendothelial monolayer was also determined in invasion chambers \nusing cytokeratin labeled quantitation of migrating cells. A mix \nassay system was employed to determine the effect of AZD3409 \non haemopoietic progenitor colony formation.  \nResults:  \nAZD3409 displayed marked anti-proliferative properties on the \nPNT2-C2, PC-3 and LNCaP prostate epithelial cell lines. There \nwas an IC50 of 9.81nM, 73.85nM and 22.06nM respectively after \n3 days of exposure to AZD3409. There was also significant \ninhibition of primary BPH epithelial cells after 3 days of \nexposure, with an IC50 of 278.7nM. AZD3409 inhibited invasion \nthrough bone marrow endothelium towards bone marrow stroma, \nwith an IC50 of 31.0nM, levels known to be attainable in vivo.  \nAZD3409 also inhibited PC-3 colony formation in primary \nhuman bone marrow stroma. Co-cultures grown in the presence \nof escalating drug concentrations resulted in reduced numbers of \ncolonies (IC50 of 160.2nM) and reduced epithelial colony size \n(IC50 of 59.9nM). AZD3409 had no significant effect on bone \nmarrow progenitor colony formation and no statistical \nsignificance between counts of any of the drug doses or the \ncontrols was demonstrated (p=0.227). \nConclusions:  \nAZD3409 is a potent inhibitor of malignant and non-malignant \nprostate epithelial cell proliferation. AZD3409 is a potential anti \nmetastatic agent inhibiting prostate epithelial cell invasion \ntowards bone marrow stroma and inhibiting colony formation \nwithin bone marrow stroma. \n \n \n \nThe role of Serotonin (5HT) and 5HT antagonists in prostate \ncancer \nE Siddiqui, M Shabbir, C Thompson, D P Mikhailidis, F Mumtaz \nDepartment of Surgery\/Chemical Pathology, Royal Free Hospital \nand University College Medical School, University College \nLondon, Pond Street, Hampstead, London. NW3 2QG.  \n \nIntroduction  \nThe ability of prostate cancer to survive androgen withdrawal \ntherapy has led to a search for alternative pathways for control of \ntumour growth.  Data indicates an increase in neuroendocrine \ncells in malignant prostate tissue. These cells release growth \nfactors including neuropeptides and biogenic amines which are \ncorrelated to tumour progression, androgen independence and \npoor prognosis. \nSerotonin (5HT) a monoamine neurotransmitter mediates a wide \nrange of physiological activities by binding to receptor subtypes. \nWe evaluated the effect of Serotonin (5HT) and 5HT receptor \nsubtype antagonists on the growth of prostate cancer.  \nMaterials and Methods \nPC3 cells (androgen independent human prostate cancer) were \nobtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells \nwere plated in serum supplemented growth medium at 5000 cells \nper well in 96 well plates. Drugs were added after 24 hours. The \neffect of Serotonin (5HT) and 5HT receptor antagonists on PC3 \ncell line was studied via colorimetric assay using crystal violet \nand was read using a spectrophotometric plate reader. Readings \nwere done at 72 hours after addition of drugs. \nResults \nThe 5HT receptor subtype antagonists used were 5HT1A, \n5HT1B, 5HT1D, 5HT2, 5HT3, 5HT4. There was no 5HT1C \nreceptor antagonist available.  5HT1B antagonist has a dose \ndependant growth inhibitory effect on PC3 cells inhibiting 78% \n(n=12, P< 0.05) cell growth at a concentration of 10\u22124M at 72 \nhours. 5HT1A antagonist has a 20% (n=12, P<0.05) growth \ninhibitory effect on PC3 cells at the same concentration at 72 \nhours. The remaining 5HT receptor subtype antagonists had no \neffects on cell growth. Serotonin (5HT) caused a dose dependant \ncell proliferation leading to a 15% (n=12, P<0.05) increase in \ncells at a concentration of 10\u22128M as compared to control at 72 \nhours. \nConclusion \nSerotonin (5HT) leads to proliferation of prostate cancer cells \nwhereas the 5HT1B receptor antagonist and to a lesser extent \n5HT1A receptor antagonist have a growth inhibitory effect. \nTherefore, our results of growth inhibition of human prostate \ncancer cells by serotonin antagonists in vitro have suggested that \n5HT antagonists, in particular 5HT1B receptor antagonist should \nbe studied in detail as an anti-neoplastic agent. \n \n \nRisk of cancer on follow-up biopsy following a diagnosis of \nprostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia on core biopsy. \nCane P, Kirby R, Corbishley C \nSt George\u2019s Hospital London \n \nIntroduction:  \nProstatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN) is associated with \nsynchronous invasive carcinoma. The aim of our study was to \nquantify the rate of invasive carcinoma on follow-up core biopsy \nafter an initial diagnosis of PIN. We also investigated factors that \ncould predict the presence of invasive cancer i.e. Number and \nbilaterality of involved cores at initial diagnosis and PSA level. \nMaterials and Methods:  \nWe identified a total of 57 patents who had PIN diagnosed by \noctant core biopsy between 2000 and 2003 in our department and \nhad undergone follow-up biopsies.  \nResults:  \n28% (16 of 57) cases showed invasive cancer on follow-up \nbiopsy. The rate rose to 40% (8 of 20) if more than one core was \ninvolved at initial biopsy and to 50% (8 of 16) if cores from both \nsides of the prostate were positive at initial biopsy. No significant \npredictive value was found for PSA and PSA Density values at \ntime of initial biopsy. In 46% (26 of 57) of cases, the repeat \nbiopsy showed PIN but no invasive cancer. Eleven of these cases \nwent on to have a third set of biopsies, 2 of these showed \ninvasive cancer and 4 contained further PIN. \nConclusion:  \nWe confirm the presence of PIN in core biopsies carries a \nsignificant risk of there being concurrent invasive tumour, \nparticularly if more than one core and cores from both sides of \n321\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nthe gland contain PIN. PSA values were not useful in predicting \nthe presence of cancer. \n \n \nThe effect of ethnicity on PSA failure following radical \nretropubic  prostatectomy. \nC.J. Luscombe, J.G. Young, P.G. Ryan \nCity Hospital, Birmingham \n \nIntroduction:  \nThere are no reported UK data concerning the effect of ethnicity \non PSA failure following radical therapy for prostate cancer, and \ndata from other countries are conflicting. \nMaterials and Methods:  \nThe study group comprised 98 Caucasians and 28 Afro-\nCaribbeans who had a radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) \nperformed by one surgeon between 1997 and 2003. Data were \nretrospectively collected. The statistical significance of variables \non the time to PSA failure was calculated using Cox's regression. \nPSA failure was defined as a post procedure PSA>0.1ng\/ml. \nResults:  \nPre-operative PSA was higher in the Afro-Caribbean group \n(p=0.013); median=15ng\/ml, compared with 9ng\/ml, however \nthere were no differences in Gleason score>6, positive margin \nrates, seminal vesicle involvement (SVI), extra-capsular \nextension (ECE), perineural invasion or age. 20% of patients \ndeveloped PSA failure during follow-up with an excess in the \nAfro-Caribbean group (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p=0.03). However, the \nmean follow up was longer for Afro-Caribbeans (834 days \ncompared to 694). To control for this, time to PSA progression \nwas studied. Only 3 of the variables listed above were significant \nindependent predictors of time to PSA failure; Gleason score>6 \n(p=0.007, Hazards Ratio (HR)=3.2, 95% Confidence Interval \n(95%CI)=1.4-7.5), ethnicity (p=0.012, HR=2.9, 95%CI=1.3-6.6) \nand ECE (p=0.008, HR=3.1, 95%CI=1.3-7.1). In a multivariate \nanalysis of all the variables, ethnicity was again a significant \npredictor (p=0.012, HR=4.5, 95%CI=1.4-14.5), as was positive \nmargin rate (p=0.042, HR=2.6, 95%CI=1.0-6.4). \nConclusion:  \nThese data confirm well-established predictors of PSA failure \nfollowing RRP. Furthermore they demonstrate a significant \nassociation between ethnicity and time to PSA failure. \n \n \nA comparison of the multidisciplinary team approach to men \nwith clinically localised prostate cancer in two West London \nhospitals, and the difference in their choice of radical \ntreatment \nE Rowe *, O Karim+, A Pope*, M Laniado+, H Motiwala+,  \nJ Maher*, V Mishra+, S Niewiorwski* \nWexham Park Hospital +, and Hillingdon Hospital * \n \nIntroduction \nThe aim of this study was to compare the Multidisciplinary Team \napproach (MDT), and treatment choices, of men with clinically \nlocalised prostate cancer in two West London Hospitals.  \nMaterials and Methods \nMen with clinically localised prostate cancer deemed suitable for \nradical treatment by the MDT panel where included in the study. \nA telephone interview was conducted in which men were asked \nthe reasons for their treatment choice, and their attitudes towards \nthe MDT approach. The results were compared between the two \ninstitutions. \n \nResults \nThirty two men (mean age 63.3 years, mean PSA 8.2ng\/ml) from \nhospital A were compared with 29 men form hospital B (mean \nage 62.9 years, mean PSA 7.4ng\/ml). Seventy five percent of \nmen underwent surgery at hospital A, compared to 52% at \nhospital B. All men from hospital A saw both an oncologist and a \nsurgeon compared to 79% at hospital B. Twenty five percent of \nmen at hospital A saw a cancer nurse specialist compared to 76% \nat hospital B. Ninety four percent of men at both institutions liked \nthe MDT approach. \nConclusion \nIn this cohort of identical groups of men with localised prostate \ncancer the majority of men liked the MDT approach, but the \nprocess differs in different institutions, as does the outcome in \nterms of treatment. \n \n \n \nThe BAUS Cancer Registry \u2013 An inaccurate reflection of the \nproportion of histologically-confirmed prostate cancer in \nclinical practice? \nB Patel1, R Persad2 \n(Departments of Urology, Bristol Urological Institute1, and \nBristol Royal Infirmary2) \n \nIntroduction \nHistological confirmation of prostate cancer should be the \u201cgold \nstandard\u201d. However, in clinical practice, patients are sometimes \ndiagnosed and treated in the absence of histological confirmation. \nSuch a \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d on the basis of an elevated PSA, high \nsuspicion on DRE or other positive imaging may be a reasonable \napproach. The BAUS Cancer Registry Database (2002) states that \n93.2% of the recorded cases of prostate cancer have histological \nconfirmation. Individual hospitals record the diagnosis of prostate \ncancer on the Patient administration system (PAS) or Hospital \nEpisode Statistics (HES). \nThis study investigates the rates of histological confirmation of \nprostate cancer in clinical practice, makes comparisons with the \nBAUS Cancer Registry and evaluates the reliability of a \ndiagnosis of prostate cancer on the hospital PAS database. \nMaterials and methods \nA retrospective study of 54 consecutive, newly diagnosed cases \nof prostate cancer recorded on the PAS database at a tertiary \nreferral centre. The hospital histology database and PAS were \nsearched in order to identify newly diagnosed and recorded cases \nof prostate cancer respectively. The results of both were then \ncross-referenced. The case notes of the identified patients were \nthen examined to determine the basis for the diagnosis, and the \nrelevant investigations. \nResults \nThe PAS list identified 54 new cases of prostate cancer, 37 of \nwhich featured on the histology database. On case note review, 2 \nof the patients identified as having prostate cancer on PAS did \nnot, in fact, have the disease and had been wrongly listed due to \ncoding inaccuracies. The histology database identified 39 cases. 1 \ncase had their histology omitted from the histology database. 2 \npatients with histological confirmation did not feature on the PAS \nlist. 14 patients had a clinical or non-histological diagnosis of \nprostate cancer. Our rate for histological confirmation was \n74.1%, with 25.9% of patients having no histological \nconfirmation. The reason for the absence of confirmatory \nhistology in these cases was usually high clinical suspicion in an \nelderly and frail patient, who, consequently, was not subjected to \nprostate biopsy. The PAS system had a sensitivity of 96.3%, with \n322\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\na positive predictive value of the same. The sensitivity of the \nhistology database was 72.2%. \nConclusion \nOur rate for histological confirmation of prostate cancer (74.1%) \nis well below the figure quoted by the BAUS Registry, and \nreflects actual clinical practice where we are not registering many \nsuch cases. This may be partly explained by the fact that many \nconsultants who submit to the BAUS Registry rely on their \nhistology departments to prompt registration of new patients. \nPatients with a non-histological diagnosis may therefore be \nomitted from the registry as would patients primarily under the \ncare of a non-urologist. We need to improve the registration of \nnon-histologically confirmed prostate cancer cases by the BAUS \nRegistry, and suggest that a combination of the hospital PAS or \nHES databases and the histology database be used in order to \nidentify new cases and prompt registration. \n \n \nUltrasonic Shears in Open Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy \nMcCabe JE, Javle PM \nMichael Heal Department of Urology, Leighton Hospital, Crewe \n \nIntroduction \nUltrasonic Shears (USS) are a cutting and coagulating surgical \ninstrument. The device operates at a frequency of 55.5kHz \nthrough the conversion of electrical to acoustic energy. The \nadvantages of the device are the reduction in lateral thermal \ntissue damage, combined cutting and coagulation in the same \ndevice and greater precision near vital structures. The instrument \nis used primarily in laparoscopy. We tested its use, by direct \ncomparison with traditional methods of dissection and \nhaemostasis, in open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RPP). \nMaterials and methods \nPatients undergoing RPP were assigned to two groups and either \nunderwent the procedure with the aid of the USS (Autosonix, \nTyco Healthcare) or by traditional methods of haemostasis \n(control). The groups were analysed according to blood loss, \noperative time, post-operative complications and hospital stay. \nBlood loss was calculated by peri-operative drain loss and swab \nweight. Total transfusion was also recorded. \nResults \nForty patients were analysed, of whom 22 underwent RRP in the \ncontrol group (mean age 63, mean prostate weight 43.5g) and 18 \nin the USS group (mean age 59, mean prostate weight 76.8g).  \nThere was a significant decrease in mean peri-operative blood \nloss with the USS group from 1392.5ml (control) to 587.5ml \n(p<0.001). This is reflected in a reduction of mean transfusion \nfrom 0.8 to 0.0 units. Operative time was improved with \nAutosonix from a mean of 195.3 to 175.6 minutes (p=0.02). \nHospital stay also showed a reduction from 5.3 to 4 days \n(p<0.001). \nConclusion \nThis preliminary study strongly suggests that the use of the \nultrasonic shears in RRP reduces blood loss, operative time and \nhospital stay.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeasuring tissue mechanical characteristics to assess \nmalignant prostatic disease \nS.

Tissue mechanical \nproperties can be derived by measuring the alterations to an \nenergy wave passed through the sample. Using a novel test \nmethod, we sought to establish whether differences exist between \nbenign and malignant prostatic tissue specimens assessed in vitro, \nand whether these were related to differences in tissue \nmorphology. \nMaterials and Methods \nFresh tissue specimens were collected from patients undergoing \nTURP, 11 for benign (BPH) and 11 for malignant (PCa) prostatic \nenlargement. Using a specially designed test rig, individual \nTURP chippings underwent immediate mechanical testing, by \napplying a dynamic compressive strain to the samples. The \namplitude ratio (|E*|) and phase difference (tan \u03b4) between the \nenergy waves entering and arising from the tissue, measures of \ntissue elastic and viscous components respectively, were derived.  \nIndividual sections from the processed specimens underwent \nimmunohistochemical staining and computerised image analysis \nwas used to measure the morphological characteristics of each \nTURP chipping. Mean values for each prostate were then \ncalculated. Unpaired t-test assuming equal variances was used to \ncompare the mechanical and morphological characteristics of \nBPH and PCa prostates and linear regression analysis was used to \nassess correlations between morphological and mechanical \nmeasurements. \nResults \nThere were significant differences between the morphology of \nthe BPH and PCa prostates. There was a significantly greater \nepithelial tissue (ET) content within the PCa prostates (p=0.01), \nwhich was composed of glandular acini whose mean area was \nsignificantly smaller than within the BPH prostates (p=0.0008).  \nTan \u03b4 was significantly smaller within the PCa prostates (p=001). \nThere was no difference between the BPH and PCa prostates with \nrespect to |E*|. Within the PCa prostates, there was a strong \nnegative correlation between the ET content and tan \u03b4 (R2=0.58, \np=0.001). \nConclusions \nThis study shows that measurable differences exist between the \nmechanical characteristics of benign and malignant prostates. \nThese differences reflected the composition of the tissues, and \nthere were significant correlations between prostatic tissue \nmorphology and its mechanical characteristics. The ability to \nquantify prostatic tissue mechanical characteristics in vivo may \nallow the detection of malignancy, and by reflecting the volume \nand grade of the malignant tissue present, may aid in the staging \nof PCa. We therefore believe that this approach may be of \nclinical benefit in the future assessment malignant prostatic \ndisease. \n \n \n \n323\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nLaparoscopic vs. open radical retropubic prostatectomy \u2014\nperi-operative cost comparison and experimental predictive \nmodel for costing at a tertiary U.K. referral centre \nSashi Kommu, Suril Patel, Mark P Wright, Raj A Persad \nBristol Urological Institute, Bristol, U.K. \n \nIntroduction  \nLaparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) is becoming a gold \nstandard treatment for localised prostate cancer in many units. \nVery few studies have looked at the economic impact of LRP \ndespite the need for validation of this relatively new technique \nfrom a health economics point of view. The aim of our study was \nto perform a detailed comparison of the perioperative costs of \npatients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open \nradical retropubic prostatectomy (ORP) and to develop a \npredictive model for estimation of perioperative cost applicable \nin a U.K. setting. \nMaterials and Methods  \nA retrospective cost review was done of a cohort of randomly \nchosen cases from a database pool of radical prostatectomies \nperformed during a 36-month period. 15 cases were selected from \nthe LRP group and 15 from the ORP group. The hospital costs \nwere evaluated for each patient using the categories of \nanaesthetic consumables, surgical consumables, post operative \nanalgesia, antibiotics, blood units transfused and post operative \ndays on ward. We omitted factors such as personnel fees and \noperating room time as these are not standardised and are subject \nto wide variability often only partially reflective of the actual \nprocedure. We also developed a predictive model for estimation \nof cost and tested its applicability in predicting costs at two \nindependent hospitals using their database of 2 LRP and 2 ORP \ncases. \nResults  \nThe median perioperative costs for surgical consumables were \nLRP=402.27 GBP vs. ORP=184.87 GBP.  \nThe median perioperative anaesthetic consumables cost was \nLRP=225.15 GBP vs. ORP=168.84 GBP. Postoperative analgesia \ncost was LRP=10.13 GBP vs. ORP=14.43 GBP. There was no \ndifference in antibiotic costs in the two groups (9 GBP). The cost \nof transfusing one unit of blood in the U.K. is 122.28 GBP. The \ntransfusion rate for ORP was (2\/15=13.3% i.e. average of 16.26 \nGBP per patient) vs. (1\/15=6.7% i.e. average of 8.13 GBP) in the \nLRP group. The days of stay post op were LRP =2.7 vs. ORP 3.8. \nThe median perioperative costs of patients undergoing LRP \n(662.81 GBP) were higher than ORP (393.40; P = 0.001). Our \nprediction model was able to estimate that on average a LRP will \ncost 1.7 times more than ORP using specific fixed variables. \n[GBP-Great Britain Pound] \nConclusion  \nOur study shows that the standard costs of LRP are greater than \nORP by a factor of 1.7 if total hospital admission time is \nexcluded. If hospital time spent is included the patient who \nundergoes ORP stays on average (3.8\/2.7) 1.4 times longer than \nthe LRP patient. The offset in costing as a result of the longer \nadmission time in ORP depends on individual cost of a room per \nday. Our findings are reflective of some United States studies, \nwhich found that the cost of LRP is greater than ORP by a factor \nof approximately 1.5. The differences between open and \nlaparoscopic radical prostatectomy remain to be fully defined in \nterms of long term oncological and qality of life outcomes but we \nfeel that we have made a contribution in defining the procedure \nthat places greater financial stress on NHS resources in the \ncurrent health economic climate. Large-scale studies are needed \nto further validate our preliminary findings. Our cost prediction \nmodel may aid in defining some of the cost parameters and act as \na template to build upon for further improvements in costing. \n \n \nPeriprostatic infiltration of local anaesthetic during  \ntransrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate in an \noffice based setting-the analgesic efficacy in a typical  \nU.K. District General Hospital \nSashi Kommu, Amit Dhulkotia, Ravee S Surange, Vincent \nGonzales and  Neeraj K Sharma \nThe Royal Oldham Hospital, The Acute Pennine Hospitals NHS \nTrust. Oldham.  \n \nIntroduction  \nTransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided needle biopsy of the \nprostate is the standard procedure to diagnose prostate cancer. \nWith the current exponential increase in the number of men being \nbiopsied to rule out prostate cancer, pain control and patient \ncomfort are of major concern. Most published studies regarding \nuse of local anaesthetic (LA) during TRUS biopsy were done in \nspecialist centres in the past. The aim of this study was to test the \nanalgesic efficacy of periprostatic infiltration of local anaesthetic \nduring TRUS biopsy of the prostate and to look at complication \nrates in a typical U.K. district general hospital in an office based \nsetting. \nMaterials and Methods  \nThis was a prospective clinical trial in which a total of 308 \npatients were studied. Patients were sequentially allotted into two \ngroups. In one group all men received a total of 15 mL of 1% \nlidocaine in the lateral and apical periprostatic regions, 5 mL in \neach point, approximately 10 minutes before the prostate biopsy. \nThe other group received no analgesic. Pain after each biopsy (a \ntotal of 8-12 biopsies) was assessed using a 10-point linear visual \nanalog pain scale to record visual analogue pain scores (VAS). \nWe also looked at immediate and late complications associated \nwith the procedure by establishing a nurse specialist lead follow \nup network. \nResults  \nPatients who received LA had significantly lower pain scores \ncompared to  those not given analgesic. The relative risk of \npatients not given LA feeling pain was 2.9 ( 95 % confidence \ninterval  2.3-3.6 ; P<0.00001) compared to those not receiving \nanalgesic. There was no significant difference in complication \nrates between the two groups. \nConclusion  \nPeriprostatic infiltration of LA significantly decreases pain in \nTRUS guided biopsy of the prostate with no additional risk of \ncomplications. We advocate the routine use of this procedure in \nall patients to improve patient comfort and tolerance. This study \nalso shows that the procedure can be done safely and effectively \nin a district general hospital office based setting. \n \n \nPSA test, how much non urologists know? \nMr Bashar Zelhof, Mr AJ Browning,  Mr CS Biyani \nPinderfields General Hospital, Mid-Yorkshire NHS Trust \nWakefield \n \nIntroduction \nThe measurement of prostate specific antigen has contributed to \nthe startling increase in the number of cases of prostate cancer \ndiagnosed in the late 1980s. It was soon recognised that although \nPSA was sensitive, it lacked specificity. Concerns have being \nraised regarding the over-diagnosis of prostate cancer resulting \n324\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nfrom widespread PSA testing. Therefore various guidelines (1) \nhave been established regarding PSA test. \nBetween 1st of January 2003 and 30th of November 2003, 8350 \nPSA test were requested in the pathology department of Mid-\nYorkshire NHS Trust. We noticed that 544 tests were requested \non patients older than 85 years and 123 tests on patients less than \n35 years of age. \nWe investigated the level of awareness hospital-doctors and GPs \nregarding the PSA guidelines. \nAim:  \nTo improve the quality of PSA requests and reduce the overall \ncosts. \nMethods \nPSA questionnaires were sent by post to most GPs in Wakefield \nregion, and were handed personally to most hospital-doctors in \nthe relevant specialities (General Medicine, Care of Elderly, \nGeneral Surgery and Orthopaedics),  by attending departmental \nmeetings. \nThe questionnaire was designed to ask clinician on PSA \nindications, normal levels, false positive, digital rectal \nexamination in conjunction with PSA, awareness of guidelines \nand discussion with patients. \nWe received 141 replies (52\/70 GPs and 89\/89 hospital doctors). \nResults: \nMost doctors know about the definition of PSA and its role in \nprostate cancer, however, factors that influence PSA and cause \nfalse positive results were not appreciated by majority of the \nrespondents. 68% of the respondents were not aware of rise in \nPSA following instrumentation. \nOnly 48% of hospital doctor perform DRE with PSA request as \ncompared to 69% of GPs. \n60% of overall doctors discuss the test with their patients (92% \nGPs Vs 41% of hospital doctors). \nKnowledge of PSA guidelines among hospital doctors was low \n(10%), in contrast 61% of GPs were aware of the guidelines. \nConclusion: \nIn the light of our results we feel that continuing medical \neducation on PSA is very important to minimise patient\u2019s anxiety \nand to make it more cost effective. \nReferences \n1) British Association of Urological Surgeons and the \nRoyal College of Radiologists\u2019 Clinical Oncology Information \nNetwork.

Nair1, 2, R. S. Kirby2, N. D. Carter1 and  \nC. D. Fenske1  \n2St George\u2019s Hospital and 1Medical School, London SW17. \n \nIntroduction \nThe sensitive molecular technique, reverse transcriptase-\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), has been shown to detect \nprostate cells in peripheral circulation.  Potential markers for CaP \nhave been assessed for their accuracy in diagnosis. The hypoxia-\ninducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcriptional complex is thought to \nbe an important mediator of gene expression in tumours (Ivanov \net al., PNAS 1998; 95:12596-12601) The tumour\u2013associated \nisozyme, carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII), is known to be tightly \nregulated by this complex.  The involvement of CAXII in the \nacidification of the extracellular milieu (Ivanov et al., PNAS \n1998; 95:12596-12601) may contribute to the formation of a \nmicroenvironment, conducive to tumour growth and spread.  \nUsing RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), CAXII was \nanalysed as a potentially accurate marker in the diagnosis and \nmonitoring of prostate cancer development\/progression. \nMethods \nTotal RNA was extracted in quadruplet from blood taken from \n112 patients. CAXII gene expression was analysed by RT-PCR \nand qRT-PCR using the LightCycler\u2122 (Roche). \nResults \nRT-PCR results showed CAXII expression in patients diagnosed \nwith benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, 5\/7), localised CaP \n(LocCaP, 66\/70) and metastatic CaP (MetCaP, 31\/35). However, \nobvious differences in product band intensities were further \ninvestigated using qRT-PCR. Using relative qRT-PCR, mean \nCAXII expression was calculated to be 118.5 (BPH -10 patients), \n703.9 (LocCaP-8 patients) and 40.1 (MetCaP-18 patients). CAXII \nexpression in the LocCaP group was 6-fold higher than that of the \nBPH group and 18-fold higher than that of the MetCaP group. No \ncorrelation between CAXII expression and PSA\/Gleason scores \nwas found.  No CAXII expression was demonstrated in \nfemale\/male control patients. \nDiscussion \nOur results demonstrate upregulation of CAXII expression in the \nLocCaP group and down regulation in the MetCaP patient group. \nThe majority of MetCaP patients were hormone refractory.  As \nCAXII is hypoxia-induced (via HIF-1), this would indicate that \nhypoxia is a mechanism involved in CaP development.  However, \ndown regulation of CAXII in MetCaP patients, indicates a \npossible alternative pathway that overrides the hypoxia-induced \nmechanism in hormone refractory end-stage CaP.  CAIX, another \nhypoxia-induced carbonic anhydrase isozyme has been shown to \ndemonstrate a similar expression pattern, being upregulated in \nwell-differentiated gastric tumours, and down regulated in poorly \ndifferentiated tumours (Leppilampi et al. Abstract 6th Int. Conf. \nCarbonic Anhydrases June 2003 P14). qRT-PCR is an extremely \nsensitive, accurate technique for measuring expression of \ncandidate CaP markers. CAXII is a potentially excellent \nmolecular marker in routine clinical diagnosis and prognosis of \nCaP.  Furthermore, CAXII is a potential target for therapy as it \ncan be selectively and specifically inhibited by acetazolamide. \n \n \n \nSummer Audit of TRUS Guided Prostate Biopsies \nA MacLeod, J McKnight, C Hagan \nBelfast City Hospital \n \nWe audited our prostate biopsy clinic for a period of 4 weeks \nstarting from the 17 May 2004.  The aims of this audit were to \ndelineate the population demographics, referral patterns and \nwaiting times for the clinic.  The positive biopsy rate, \ncomplication rate and patient satisfaction were also worked out. \nMethod \nAll of the patients attending the clinic during the auditing period \nwere asked to participate while consent was being obtained.  All \nagreed to inclusion.  The biopsies were taken as normal, using the \nsame ultrasound probe for all biopsies, by 5 different operators  \nAfter informed consent was obtained, the patient was given \n120mg gentamycin.  The patient then had a DRE, followed by an \nexamination with ultrasound.  Under ultrasound guidance 10mls \nof 1% lignocaine was infiltrated around the prostate.  Biopsies \nwere then taken.  Following the procedure the patients were given \n500mg metronidazole PR and 3 days of ciprofloxacin 500mg bd \nPO.  The patients were asked to keep a record of any \n325\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\ncomplications, and this data was retrieved by a phone call several \nweeks later. \nResults \nOver the 4 week period 44 patients were given appointments to \nattend for biopsies.  38 biopsies were carried out. 3 were not able \nto be contacted for collation of results.  Biopsies were taken on \npatients aged 46 to 88, the majority aged from 56 to 80.  15 were \nreferred direct by the GP, 16 from clinic and 12 from other \nconsultants who did not carry out biopsies as part of their \npractice.  Most patients waited from 60 to 100 days. Positive \nbiopsy rate was 55%.  22 of the patients had no pain to mild pain \nduring the procedure.  8 had moderate and 5 severe pain. Most \npatients found pain was limited to the procedure, although 5 had \npain for some hours and 7 for longer than 24hrs. 77% had \nhaematuria (70% of which settled within a few days), 40% had \nblood PR (70% settled within one day) and 34% haematospermia \nwhich generally took several weeks to settle.  A small number \nnoticed flow problems (although a similar number noted \nimprovements), dysuria, or signs of infection.  One gentleman \nsuffered a stroke after being off clopidogrel for 14 days and was \nthe only patient to require admission due to the procedure.  He \nstill had dysphasia several weeks after the stroke. \nConclusions \nThe waiting time for prostate biopsies is far too long.  All should \nbe seen within 2 weeks.  However, the waiting list is falling and \nwill fall further with the addition of an extra list.  In the 4 week \nperiod 4 procedures were cancelled because PSAs were not \nchecked after being sent from clinic, 1 because he was still on \nclopidogrel, and one patient did not attend.  Furthermore, 2 were \nbiopsied who already had tissue diagnoses.  Efficient utilisation \nof appointments is paramount, perhaps with utilisation of a \ndatabase.  Complications were expected and in most cases short \nduration with minimal impact on patients.  The patient who had a \nstroke has prompted discussion about prophylaxis with other \nagents while off anti-platelet drugs and warfarin.  Also most \npatients suffered little pain but those who did may benefit from \nmore lignocaine.  Also, a longer acting agent also may reduce the \nnumbers of patients with pain post-procedure.  Further audits are \nplanned with regard to differing local anaesthetic agents and \ndoses. \n \n \n \nEffect of very low fat diet on progressive prostate cancer:  \nexperience from a dedicated clinic \nJ. Philip*\u2021, B. Rogers*, J.S. Grime\u00a7, N.J. Parr* \n*Department of Urology, Wirral Hospital CH49 5PE and \n\u00a7Department of Pathology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, \nL7 8XP \n \nIntroduction \nTotal dietary fat has been associated with an increased incidence \nand mortality from prostate cancer (CaP). Animal models with \nimplanted human CaP cell lines have reported arrest of growth in \nthose changed to a very low fat diet (VLFD, <20% fat). We \noffered such a diet to patients with progressive CaP. \nPatients and Methods \nOver 4 years, 22 patients with good performance status \nundergoing either active surveillance (n= 8) or hormonal \nmanipulation (n= 14), with biochemical evidence of disease \nprogression (2 successive PSA interval rises) adopted VLFD. Fat-\nsoluble vitamins were supplemented. Patients were reviewed 3-\nmonthly in a dedicated nurse specialist clinic assessing body \nmass index (BMI), PSA, PSADT, PSA velocity, lipid profile and \nquality of life (QoL). PSA was log transformed as rapid cancer \nproliferation shows log linear growth. \nResults \nMean age of the patients was 70.1yrs (range 59-80) with a PSA \nrange of 3.5 \u201343.6 ng\/ml on commencing VLFD. Mean follow-up \nwas 54.8 wks (range 10-152).  16 patients were diagnosed with \nwell\/ moderately differentiated CaP (Gleason score > 6) with six \nhaving poorly differentiated CaP (Gleason score <6). There was \nno significant difference in age between the groups.  Patients with \nwell\/ moderately differentiated showed a significant increase in \nPSA doubling time (PSADT) [p= 0.037] and a reduced PSA \nvelocity. Half of the patients with poorly differentiated CaP had a \nprolonged PSADT [Table 1].  BMI showed no significant change, \nbut serum cholesterol fell significantly (p<0.05). Patients felt \nsubjectively better on VLFD with only two reporting restricted \nQoL. \nConclusion \nThese early results are encouraging and suggest that in men with \nprogressive prostate cancer, VLFD results in reduction in the rate \nof PSA progression with significant prolongation of PSADT in \npatients with well\/ moderately differentiated CaP. A good QoL is \nalso maintained. This merits further multi-centre studies \ninvolving larger populations. \n \n  Table 1: PSA doubling time Vs.

The aim of this \nstudy was to assess whether new patients attending Rapid Access \nProstate Clinic had enough understanding to have given informed \nconsent for the PSA test to be done.  Did they understand? \n\u2022 the role of the PSA test \n\u2022 why it was checked in their individual case \n\u2022 The implications of a positive PSA test. \nMaterials and Methods \nAll new patients referred to a special Rapid Access Prostate \nClinic who had their PSA tested in Primary Care were asked to \ncomplete a questionnaire, under the supervision of a nurse, before \ntheir scheduled appointment.  This was done over a period of five \n326\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nmonths.  The first 15 questionnaires were used as a pilot study \nresulting in a modified questionnaire.  The patients were asked \nabout their knowledge of the PSA test, where from and in what \nform this information had been given to them and their \noccupational background. \nResults \nOf 78 eligible patients, 76 completed the questionnaire.  Only 22 \npatients (29%) felt they knew what PSA is.  The other 54 patients \n(71%) were either not sure (12) or did not know (42) what PSA \nis.  72% of these 54 patients could not recall an explanation \nhaving ever been given, the other 28% was divided amongst \nthose that had received a poor explanation (18%) or had forgotten \nthe explanation (10%).  Of the 22 patients that felt they knew \nwhat PSA is, only 58% knew that a high PSA indicated the \npossibility of prostate cancer and only 17% knew of the \nimplications of a positive PSA test e.g. TRUS biopsy.   In 46% of \ncases, the GP had offered the test.  In the majority of cases \n(61%), the patient had presented with trouble with their \nwaterworks.  Only 12% remember having pre-test counselling \nand only 1 patient received any written information. \nConclusion \nMen are being tested for prostate cancer in Primary Care without \ninformed consent.  The majority do not understand what PSA is, \nwhat its role is, or the implications of the test and thus cannot \nmake an informed decision.  This seems to be irrespective of age \nand occupational background. \nConsidering that prostate cancer is estimated to be the most \ncommon cancer in UK men by 2005, we recommend that there \nshould be an increase in patient information made available prior \nto PSA testing.  This information can be written and\/or verbal.  \nThe latter can be from dedicated nurse practitioners, perhaps \nholding prostate awareness clinics in Primary Care.  This has \nsignificant implications for Primary Care teams; however we \nbelieve that the benefit of empowering the patient will be reaped \nby both the patients and the health service. \n \n \nMicrostaging of carcinoma of the prostate: can biopsy \nfindings predict if a tumour is clinically insignificant? \nAlison Yates, Rhidian Hurle, D L Cochlin, H G Kynaston,  \nD F R Griffiths \nDepartments of Urology, Radiology and Pathology, University \nHospital of Wales, Cardiff. \n \nIntroduction  \nThere is no consensus as to the correct treatment for a man with \norgan confined prostate cancer. A significant minority of tumours \ndetected by PSA screening are clinically insignificant (less than \n0.5ml tumour volume) and offer minimal risk to the patients .  If \nthese tumours could be identified then it would be appropriate to \nadvise surveillance in these patients.  In theory accurate sampling \nof the gland by a biopsy protocol should allow assessment of \ntumour volume but previous attempts at this have show poor \npredictive value, possibly because either variation in biopsy \ntechnique or suboptimal histological processing.  The aim of this \nstudy was to determine if reasonable prediction of tumour size by \nbiopsy findings was more likely in the context of consistent \nbiopsy practise and meticulous histological processing.  \nMethod \nAnalysis of prostates from 151 consecutive radical prostatectomy \noperations from patients who had previously had sextant or more \nbiopsies that had been performed by one of two radiologists \nhaving a special interest in the biopsy technique.  Biopsy \nspecimens has been processed for histology in separate cassettes, \nembedded flat and three levels cut from each block. On average \n15mm of core was examined from each sample.  Radical \nprostatectomy specimens had been fully embedded and the \nvolume of tumour estimated from the dimensions of the \nsmoothed ellipsoid enclosing the tumour.  Number of positive \ncores, maximum length of adenocarcinoma in a core (MLA), and \nRRP tumour volume had been recorded in each case. \nResults \nThere was a strong correlation between both the number of cores \npositive and the MLA with the tumour volume and stage.  27 \n(18%) tumours had a volume of 0.5ml or less.  80 cases had a \nMLA on biopsy of \u22644mm and 71 cases had a MLA of >4mm.  \nFor the cases with a MLA of \u22644mm, 25 (32%) had a tumour with \na volume of \u22640.5ml. For the cases with a MLA of >4mm, 2 (3%) \nhad a tumour with a volume of \u22640.5ml. 29 cases had only a single \ncore positive and an MLA of \u22644mm, of these 15 (52%) had \nclinically insignificant tumours. \nConclusion \nWith consistent biopsy technique and meticulous histological \nprocessing biopsy findings can predict tumour size. This \nmicrostaging could probably be improved if analysis was limited \nto octant biopsies or more and if PSA level, biopsy Gleason \ngrade, and imaging findings are also taken into account.  Future \nreports examining the predictive value of biopsies should give \nfull details of biopsy technique and histological processing.  \n \n \n \nInhibiting Prostate Cancer cell growth by the new technique \nof RNA interference on the emerging gene TSG101. \nN C Borley, G Zhu, I R Hart, G H Muir \nKing\u2019s College and St Thomas\u2019 Hospitals, London. \n \nIntroduction \nThe gene TSG101 was originally defined as a tumour suppressor \ngene, raising the expectation that absence of the encoded protein \nshould lead to increased tumour cell growth. There has been \nconflicting evidence as to the gene\u2019s function and the role it plays \nin cell growth. We have specifically inhibited the gene by RNA \ninterference to study it\u2019s function. \nMaterial and Methods  \nThe technique of RNA interference (RNAi) was used to \ndownregulate the gene TSG101 in PC3 (prostate cancer) cells. 2 \ncontrols were used, one with exactly the same cell handling, the \nother with \u201cscrambled\u201d RNA causing interference. Protein levels \nwere detected by Western Blotting.   The effect of this on the \ncells was examined with growth curves, colony formation assays, \ninvasion and migration assys, and BUDR labeling to examine the \ncell cycle. \nResults  \nAn approximately 94% selective downregulation at the protein \nlevel was achieved. This treatment resulted in marked inhibition \nof tumour cell growth. The decreased level of TSG101 protein \ncaused partial cell cycle arrest at the G1\/S boundary. \nAdditionally, RNAi-mediated downregulation of TSG101 \nreduced the colony forming capacity of the cells by \napproximately 89%. This treatment did not result in any effect on \nthe migration or invasion behaviour of these cells.  \nConclusion  \nThese results firstly demonstrate the effects of the highly \npowerful technique of RNA interference. They also show that the \nTSG101 gene does not comply with the usual characteristics of a \ntumour suppressor gene that it had been thought to be. But rather \nthat its expression may be necessary for activities associated with \n327\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\naspects of tumour growth, having implications for both prostate \nand other cancers. \n \n \nSilencing of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor \n(IGF1R) gene enhances sensitivity of prostate cancer to DNA \ndamaging agents through impaired homologous \nrecombination \nMA Rochester1,2, BW Turney1,2, SF Brewster2, VM Macaulay1  \n1Molecular Oncology Laboratories, Weatherall Institute of \nMolecular Medicine, Oxford, UK; 2Department of Urology, \nChurchill Hospital, Oxford, UK \n \nIntroduction \nThe IGF1R is overexpressed in prostate cancer, and IGF \nsignalling enhances protection from apoptosis. Silencing the \nIGF1R gene by RNA interference leads to impaired survival of \nprostate cancer cells in vitro, and enhanced sensitivity to \ntherapies which cause double-strand DNA breaks, but not to \nthose which kill by other means, suggesting a link between IGF \nsignalling and DNA repair. Previous work in our laboratory has \nshown decreased activation of ATM after IGF1R downregulation \nby antisense. ATM orchestrates the DNA damage response, and \nis the product of the gene mutated in Ataxia Telangiectasia. We \nwished to determine if the differential chemosensitisation in \nprostate cancer cells was a result of altered ATM function, and\/or \na direct effect on DNA repair. \nMaterials and Methods \nWe used oligofectamine to transfect IGF1R siRNAs or inverted \nsequence controls into two prostate cancer cell lines: DU145 \n(androgen-resistant, wild type PTEN), and PC3 (androgen-\nresistant, PTEN mutant). ATM function was measured by an \nATM kinase assay, and response to double-strand DNA breaks \ninduced by ionising radiation was assessed by pulsed-field gel \nelectrophoresis (PFGE). DNA repair was evaluated directly using \npreviously described in vitro assays of non-homologous end-\njoining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). \nResults \nTransfection with 200nM siRNA inhibited IGF1R expression to \n15-20% of control levels. This treatment led to impaired ATM \nactivation after 20 Gy irradiation, shown by a kinase assay. \nPulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed delayed DNA \nrepair in siRNA-treated DU145 cells at time-points up to 6 hours \nafter irradiation.  IGF1R gene silencing had no effect on NHEJ, \nbut in both PC3 (p<0.001) and DU145 (p<0.05) this led to \napproximately 50% reduction in ability to repair by HR. \nConclusion \nIGF1R targeting by siRNA inhibited ATM kinase activity, in \nkeeping with our previous report of impaired DNA damage \nresponses following IGF1R downregulation.  The delayed DNA \nrepair up to 6 hours after IGF1R silencing shown by PFGE is not \nconsistent with an ATM defect alone, since ATM null cells have \nnormal kinetics of DNA repair at this time. We showed that \nsiRNA treatment had no effect on NHEJ, but led to significant \nimpairment of homologous recombination repair in both PC3 and \nDU145, suggesting a link between IGF signalling and the HR \nmachinery. These results have implications for the choice of \ncombination therapies when IGF1R targeting strategies reach the \nclinic. \n \n \n \n \n \nA randomised controlled trial of topical glyceryl trinitrate for \ntransrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy \nMA Rochester1,2, K Le Monnier2, SF Brewster2  \nMolecular Oncology Laboratories, Weatherall Institute of \nMolecular Medicine, Oxford, UK; 2Department of Urology, \nChurchill Hospital, Oxford, UK \n \nIntroduction \nTransrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy is the standard \nmethod of diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate. Studies have \nshown decreased pain associated with this procedure following \nlocal anaesthesia. Many patients find anal distension to be the \nmost painful part of their procedure, for which local anaesthetic \ninfiltration has little benefit. Topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) \npaste is commonly used for the treatment of anal fissure. The \nmechanism of action is through reduced anal sphincter tone. We \nevaluated the efficacy and tolerance of topical 0.2% GTN paste \nversus placebo to reduce pain associated with TRUS biopsy.  \nMaterials & Methods \nBetween October 2003 and April 2004, 134 consecutive patients \nreferred for first prostate biopsy were randomised to receive \neither topical 0.2% GTN paste or placebo 30 minutes prior to \nbiopsy. Participants completed a 10 point visual analogue pain \nscore following the procedure. Pulse and blood pressure were \nrecorded before and during the procedure.  \nResults \nThe mean age of the patients was 68.5 years for the GTN group \nand 68.8 for placebo. There was a significant decrease in mean \npain score in the GTN group compared with placebo (3.7 versus \n4.8, p=0.0016). There were no significant changes in pulse or \nblood pressure between the groups. 6 patients (10%) in the GTN \ngroup complained of headache.  \nConclusions \nTopical GTN paste is an effective and well tolerated method of \nreducing pain associated with transrectal ultrasound guided \nprostate biopsy. It is a safe and easy to use alternative to other \nmethods and should be offered to patients undergoing this \nprocedure.  \n \n \nPathologists estimation of percentage carcinoma in radical \nprostatectomy specimens \u2013 A literature review and a grid \nmethod for calculation \nClare Verrill, Paul Strike, Clare Fuller. \nHistopathology Department, Salisbury District Hospital, \nSalisbury.  \n \nIntroduction \nWe reviewed the literature in an attempt to determine whether \nvolume of prostatic adenocarcinoma is an independent prognostic \nvariable for disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  \nPercentage surface area of gland infiltrated by adenocarcinoma in \nradical prostatectomy specimens is routinely recorded within \nproforma standardised reports at Salisbury District Hospital.  It is \nnot a data item within the RCPath minimum dataset for prostate \ncancer.  We wished to find an easy, reliable and time efficient \nmethod of measuring percentage surface area of tumour.   \nMaterials and Methods \nWe compared 3 methods of measuring percentage surface area of \ngland infiltrated by adenocarcinoma in radical prostatectomy \nspecimens; using a microscopic 1mm2  grid counting, \nmacroscopic 10mm2 grid counting and visual estimation by \npathologist without aid of a grid.  We reviewed the literature \nusing medline.   \n328\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nResults \nThe microscopic 1mm2 grid, shown to be as accurate as computer \nassisted morphometry (Humphrey et al, Mod Pathol \n1997;10:326-33) took 90 minutes per case.  The macroscopic \n10mm2 grid took 10 minutes per case.  The 2 methods gave \nsimilar results.  Pathologists unaided by a grid were up to 25% \nout in their estimation. \nLiterature review showed that many of the published studies did \nnot contain enough subjects to enable reliable interpretation of \nthe results.  Of the studies containing sufficient subjects, 2 \nshowed that percentage carcinoma is an independent predictor of \nrecurrence (Ramos et al, J Urol 2004; 172: 137-140 and \nCarvalhal et al, Cancer 2000; 89:1308-1314) and 2 showed that \ntumour size (as determined by alternative methods) is an \nindependent prognostic factor (Renshaw et al, Anat Pathol \n1999;111:641-644 and Stamey et al, JAMA 1999;281:1395-\n1400).  1 showed that tumour size was not an independent \nprognostic factor (Epstein et al, J Urol 1993; 149:1478-1481).  \nConclusion \nLiterature review has found evidence that percentage surface area \nof carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor for disease \nrecurrence after radical prostatectomy.  We therefore recommend \nthat this measurement is an essential data item for inclusion in \nhistopathology reports.  We have described a quick method \nwhich provides an accurate measurement and could be used in \neveryday practice.  \n \n \nPalliative pelvic exenteration for advanced prostate cancer.  \nS B Ganta, H Yamamoto, DA Ashdown, DMA Wallace.  \nUniversity Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.  \n \nIntroduction  \nLocally recurrent prostate cancer is debilitating with significant \nlocal symptoms. Pain associated with rectal involvement of the \nprostate disease is difficult to palliate using conventional \ntechniques. We describe 6 patients who underwent a pelvic \nexenteration for palliation of advanced prostate cancer.  \nMaterials and Methods \nWe retrospectively reviewed the data of six patients who \nunderwent palliative exenteration and diversion for prostate \ncancer between 1986 and 2002. Patients were selected for total \npelvic exenteration based on clinically advanced prostate cancer \nwith intractable symptoms despite hormone treatment and \nradiotherapy. The median follow up was 25.7 months (range \n12.1-47.2 months). Data were collected regarding cancer therapy, \npain requirements prior to surgery, complications, symptom free \nsurvival and overall survival. \nResults \nThe mean age prior to surgery was 68.4 years (range 62-78 \nyears). The mean duration between diagnosis and operation was \n5.1 years (range 4.3-6.9). The mean preoperative PSA was 31 \n(range 0.1-173). All patients had had radiation therapy to the \npelvis and androgen deprivation treatment. One patient had prior \nradical retropubic prostatectomy. Surgery included total pelvic \nexenteration followed by an end colostomy and ileal conduit \nurinary diversion. The rectum was spared in one patient. There \nwas no post operative mortality. The median symptom free \nsurvival was 12 months (range 4-36 months). The median overall \nsurvival was 25.7 months (range 12.1-47.2 months). Three \npatients died of disease progression and two died of other causes \nwithout disease progression and one is alive with disease \nprogression.  \n \nConclusion \nPelvic exenteration effectively palliated symptoms of advanced \nlocal recurrence for a median period of 12 months with \nacceptable post operative morbidity. It is an effective treatment in \nselected patients in experienced hands with multidisciplinary \ncare.  \n \n \n\u2018Laparoscopic\u2019 extraperitoneal retropubic prostatectomy; the \nBirmingham experience. \nS B Ganta, D Ashdown, H Yamamoto A Doherty. \nUniversity Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham  \n \nIntroduction: \nLaparoscopic techniques for many urological procedures are now \nwell established.  Radical prostatectomy performed with minimal \ninvasive surgery by an extraperitoneal route overcomes the \nlimitations and complications entering the peritoneum and is \nsimilar to the most commonly performed open operation. \nPatients and methods:  \n67 patients with clinically organ prostate cancer underwent a \n\u2018laparoscopic\u2019 extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy performed \nby one surgeon between  June 2003 and November 2004. A \nmodified \u2018Stolzenburg technique\u2019 1 was utilized with nerve-\nsparing and a more reproducible bladder neck and urethral \ndissection. Prospective data collection of the grade, stage and \nvolume of cancer, co-morbidity, intra and post operative \ncomplications.   \nResults:  \nThe median (range) age was 65.2 (46-73) years, median PSA 7.0 \n(2.5-16) ng\/mL, Gleason sum 7 (3+4), operative time was 240 \n(135-391) min, blood loss 375 (100-1800) mL and hospital stay \nafter LRP 4.2 (2-26) nights. Nerve preservation was performed in \n28% of patients. One patient required transfusion. Three patients \nwere converted to an open procedure. There were six \ncomplications, rectal injury in two cases (one required a \ncolostomy and the other had a successful intra-operative \nlaparoscopic repair). Bladder neck stenosis, persistent urinary \nleak from drain, pulmonary embolus and paralytic ileus. The \npositive surgical margin rate reduced to 18% in the last 20 \npatients. Follow up was a mean 7.2 months (1-17.6). By 3 months \n84 % of patients were pad-free. There have been two biochemical \nfailures.  \nConclusion:  \nLearning curve relates to perfecting a technique, training \nassistants and making best use of the equipment. Several \ntechnical modifications have been introduced. Prospective data \ncollection allows for early identification and correction of \nproblems and improvements in outcome. In addition to the \nstandard benefits of minimally invasive surgery, the \nextraperitoneal approach mimics the open approach and offers \nimproved visualization. We believe that this technique is safely \nperformed by the oncologist who is familiar with the open \ntechnique.  \n \n \nThe IGF1R\/IRS1 axis and PI3K\/PKB signalling in prostate \ncell lines \nJennifer C. Spalton, Norman J. Maitland & R. Michael Sharrard,  \nUniversity of York \n \nIntroduction \nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signals through the IGF1 \nreceptor (IGF1R) to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase \n329\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\n(PI3K) activity and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of \nprotein kinase B (PKB). Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is an \nimportant mediator of PKB activation as it acts as an adaptor \nbetween the activated IGF1R and PI3K. The PKB pathway is of \nparticular interest with respect to prostate cancer as elevated \nplasma IGF1 levels are thought to have a positive correlation \nwith the disease (Chan et al. Science 1998; 279: 563-566 ; \nChokkalingam et al. The Prostate 2002; 52:98-105), and \nderegulation of the PKB pathway, through the loss of the PTEN \ntumour suppressor gene, is one of the most common events in \nprostate cancer progression (Cairns et al. Cancer Res. 1997; \n57:4997-5000; Li et al. Science 1997; 275:1943-1947). \nMaterials and methods  \nThe expression and activation of key components of the PKB \npathway were analysed in five prostate epithelial cell lines \u2013 non-\nmalignant PNT2C2 and PNT1a, early tumour P4E6, and the \nLNCaP and PC3 metastatic cancer cell lines. Reverse \ntranscription-PCR, Real-time (quantitative) PCR, \nimmunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to assess the \nlevels of expression of IGF1R and IRS1 in the prostate cell lines. \nThe effects of IGF1 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on IRS1 \nprotein levels and PKB activation were determined by western \nblotting, using specific antibodies against IRS1, Phospho-PKB \n(Thr308 and Ser473), and total PKB. siRNA was used to \ndetermine the impact of IGF1R and IRS1 inhibition on PKB \nactivation.  \nResults  \nMetastatic prostate cancer cell lines show reduced expression of \nIGF1R at both the mRNA and protein level when compared with \nthe non-metastatic cell lines. The lack of full-length IRS1 protein \nin LNCaP was found to be caused by a single base deletion that \nresults in the premature termination of the sequence. IRS1 protein \nlevels are differentially regulated in the cell lines: IGF1 induced \ndegradation of IRS1 protein in PNT2c2, PNT1a and P4E6, but \nthis was not observed in PC3. PKB was still activated on IGF1 \ntreatment even when the expression of IGF1R or IRS1 was \ninhibited by siRNA.  \nConclusions  \nThese results suggest that deregulation of IRS1 may contribute to \nthe constitutive activation of PKB during prostate cancer \nprogression through a positive feedback loop. Our results also \nhighlight the potential for crosstalk between cell signalling \npathways and signalling through alternative receptors or adaptor \nproteins.  \n \n \nGenotype and expression profiling of prostate cancer stem \ncells \nSteven D. Bryce1, Anne T. Collins1, Mike J. Stower2,  \nNorman J. Maitland1 \n1YCR Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University \nof York, York YO10 5DD \n2Department of Urology, York District Hospital, York YO31 8HE \n \nThe target cell for malignant conversion in prostate cancer \nremains to be definitively identified. The cancer stem cell model \npostulates that mutations occur only in stem cells.  \nWe have previously shown that prostate stem cells express high \nlevels of integrin \u03b12\u03b21 and the haematopoetic stem cell marker \nCD133. These cell surface markers can be exploited to select cell \npopulations highly enriched for stem cells.  \nWe have recently identified that such \u03b12\u03b21High\/CD133+ cells \ncomprise a small quantity of cells derived from prostate cancers \n(on average <0.01%). Furthermore these cells are maintained at a \nconstant proportion in the primary cell cultures obtained from \nthese tumours. As part of our ongoing studies to characterize \nthese cancer stem cells we are using Affymetrix Mapping 10K \n2.0 SNP arrays to derive comprehensive and detailed genotypes \nfrom the isolated tumour \u03b12\u03b21High\/CD133+ cells and matched \nlymphocyte controls. This in depth data is used to build up \npatterns of genomic loci loss in the cancer stem cells. In addition \nwe are obtaining comprehensive gene expression profiles, using \nAffymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips, from the same cells.  \nThis will enable us to map characteristic regions of gene loss and \nidentify with fine precision (sub mega-base resolution) novel \nlosses in clonal cell populations. The linking of comprehensive \nLOH profiles to the gene expression profiles will generate a \nunique depiction of the genetic changes underpinning this the \ndevelopment of this disease and provide solid evidence that these \ncancer stem cells are the targets for malignant transformation \nevents. \n \n \nAlterations in the expression and activation pathways of \nProtein Kinase B and its isoforms in the progression to \nmetastasis of human prostate cancer \nR. Michael Sharrard and Norman J. Maitland,  \nUniversity of York \n \nIntroduction:  \nProgression to invasiveness and metastasis in epithelial tumours \nis characterised by cell growth and survival independent of \ngrowth factors (GFs) and cell-cell and cell-matrix contact.  These \nfunctions are modulated by Protein Kinase B (PKB\/Akt), \nactivated by PIP3 generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase \n(PI3K).  Enhanced survival of metastatic prostate tumour cells \nhas been linked to deregulation of PKB activation through loss of \nthe tumour suppressor protein PTEN, which normally functions \nas an antagonist to PI3K by degrading PIP3.  Protein Kinase B \nhas multiple isoforms encoded by three separate genes (AKT1, \nAKT2 and AKT3), though until recently little has been \nestablished about the regulation and role of these isoforms.  In \nthis report we examine the expression of three major isoforms of \nPKB and their activation by growth factors during the \nprogression to metastasis of prostatic cancer. \nMaterials and methods:  \nPNT2 and PNT1a (prostatic non-tumour epithelial), P4E6 (early \nprostatic tumour) and LNCaP and PC3 (metastatic prostate \ntumour) cell lines were grown in the medium containing serum, \nthen transferred to serum-free medium overnight.  10\u00b5M \nLY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or vehicle (DMSO) were added for 2 \nhours, followed by treatment with 5 ng\/ml EGF or IGF1. Cells \nwere then harvested and analysed by Western blotting for \nexpression and phosphorylation of total PKB or its specific \nisoforms.  Cells were also transfected with expression constructs \nencoding the three PKB isoforms and their capacity to activate \nthe different isoforms in the presence or absence of GFs and \nLY294002 was analysed by Western blotting and \nimmunocytochemistry. \nResults:  \nUsing these cell lines, we previously demonstrated that prostate \ntumour cells show reduced dependence of PKB\/Akt activation on \nGFs or substrate adhesion, concomitant with enhanced sensitivity \nto the PI3K inhibitor LY294002.  Our present investigations \nshow that the different cell lines express different profiles of PKB \nisoforms, and the relative and absolute levels of these isoforms \ndetermines the phosphorylation status and total PKB activity \npresent in these cells in response to GF stimulation.  \n330\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nOverexpression of exogenous PKB \uf020isoforms results in their \nhyperphosphorylation at serine 473 and also causes increased \nphosphorylation of endogenous PKB\u001f \uf020at this residue.  \nUnexpectedly, this hyperphosphorylation was both independent \nof GF stimulation and resistant to inhibition by the PI3-kinase \ninhibitor LY294002. This indicates one mechanism by which \noverexpression of individual PKB isoforms may lead to increased \nactivity in the other isoforms of this signalling kinase. \nConclusion:   \nProstate cancer progression involves complex alterations to \nsignalling pathways regulating proliferation and survival. The \nelucidation of the mechanisms by which alterations in the pattern \nof PKB isoform expression may lead to escape from normal \ndependence on growth factor- and cellular adhesion-dependent \nsignalling provides a further step in understanding the basis of \nthis progression. The possibility that altered expression of \nindividual PKB isoforms may determine specific patterns of \nescape from normal growth constraints offers the exciting \npossibility that drugs designed against these isoforms may permit \nincreased specificity of therapeutic targeting in the treatment of \nprostate cancers and their metastases. \n \n \nHigh Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate \ncancer: The UK experience \nI M Campbell, G N Collins, A A Adeyoju, R J Brough,  \nP H O\u2019Reilly, S C W Brown. \nStepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, UK \u2013 On behalf of the North-\nWest Uro-oncology Research Group \n \nIntroduction \nHigh intensity focused ultrasound produces accurate tissue \ndestruction of a target area without damaging the intervening \ntissues. It is emerging as an alternative treatment for several \nforms of cancer, including kidney, breast, bone and prostate. \nStepping Hill Hospital is the first unit in the U.K. to introduce \nHIFU for the treatment of prostate cancer.  \nWe describe the technique, practical aspects, efficacy and patient \ntolerability of HIFU treatment for prostate cancer in our own UK \npopulation. \nMaterials and Methods \nA pilot study of 30 patients is in progress. The inclusion criteria \nare: biopsy proven prostate cancer, a PSA of <20ng\/ml, a prostate \nvolume of <40mls at baseline investigations, localized disease \n(T1\/T2) and no contraindications to a 3-hour general or spinal \nanaesthetic. All are deemed to be unsuitable for radical surgery, \nthrough patient choice, anaesthetic or surgical factors.  The \npatients receive either a general or a spinal anaesthetic. A \npreliminary channel TURP is performed. HIFU prostatectomy is \nthen undertaken with the Ablatherm\u00ae device using a 3MHz \ntransrectal probe. Serum samples are taken at baseline and at \nintervals post operatively to measure inflammatory markers, \ncardiac toxicity and PSA response. The flow rate and post-void \nresidual are measured in all patients pre and post operatively. \nQuality of life issues are evaluated using IPSS and the UCLA \nprostate cancer questionnaire. \nResults \nTechniques, practical aspects, efficacy, governance and \nevaluation are described in detail.13 patients have been treated \nand their characteristics are as follows. Mean age 69 years, \nGleason 3+3 (median) and a mean volume of 27cm3. All patients \nhad stage 1 or 2 disease with a mean PSA of 7.3ng\/ml (range 3.4 \n\u2013 17.3). 9 patients have reached 3 months follow up. There have \nbeen no intra-operative complications. The majority of patients \nwere discharged on day 1 post operatively. All patients showed a \nPSA response with 5 out of 8 patients who received a complete \ntreatment achieving a PSA less than 1.0 at 3 months. All patients \nhad an elevated CRP post operatively, however this resolved in \nthe majority by 1 week. 1 patient had an elevated Troponin T as a \nresult of a pulmonary embolism. The QOL and IPSS scores had \nimproved or remained static in 5 out of 6 responses so far.  \nConclusion \nThis preliminary report of our very early experience suggests \ngood tolerability and a promising initial PSA response. \n \n \nDo type I receptor tyrosine kinases drive hormone \nrefractory prostate cancer? \nDr J Edwards, Miss A F. Munro, Dr B Dunne, Miss C Pirrett,  \nDr J. M.S. Bartlett. \nGlasgow Royal Infirmary and University of Glasgow \n \nIntroduction \nRelapse during androgen withdrawal therapy is a major cause \nof prostate cancer morbidity and mortality. Androgen receptor \nmutations (6-10%) and amplifications (20-30%) may explain \nrelapse in some cases, however in approximately 70% of cases \nalternative mechanisms must be invoked. Our evidence \nsuggests that type I receptor tyrosine kinases play a role in the \ndevelopment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. \nMaterials and Methods \nProtein expression and activation of type I receptor tyrosine \nkinases was determined by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of \nmatched tumour pairs (one taken before and one after hormone \nrelapse) from 65 prostate cancer patients.  Five antibodies were \nused, EGFR (Zymed), HER2 (DAKO HercepTestTM), \nphosphorylated EGFR (Cell Signalling), phosphorylated HER2 \n(Neomarkers) and EGFR VIII (Zymed).  Detection and \nvisualisation and was achieved using the LSAB+ kit (DAKO \nCytomation) and DAB  (Vector Laboratories). Two independent \nobservers using a weighted histoscore method scored each \nsection. \nResults \nTumour expression rates for EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR \nwere low in both hormone sensitive (36% and 9%) and \nhormone refractory tumours (36% and 11% respectively), with \nno significant increase in expression or activation with the \ndevelopment of hormone refractory prostate cancer.  Whilst \nexpression rates were higher for HER2, phosphorylated HER2 \nand EGFR VIII no significant increase in median expression \nwas observed with the development of hormone refractory \nprostate cancer (48% to 67.3 %, 43% to 42% and 100% to \n100%).  \nIntriguingly, however, those patients whose tumours expressed \nlow levels of phosphorylated HER2 in their primary tumour \nrelapsed significantly earlier than those who expressed high \nlevels of phosphorylated HER2 (0.039, Kaplan Meier). \nBy using matched tumour pairs we were able to identify patients, \nfor each protein, whose tumours showed an increase in protein \nexpression with the development of hormone escape, no change \nand or a decrease in protein expression.  A change in protein \nexpression was defined as an increase or decrease greater than the \n95% confidence interval for inter-observer variation when \ncomparing expression between pre and post hormone relapse \ncases. \nUsing this method time to death post hormone relapse, was \nmarkedly decreased for those patients with an increase in HER2 \nexpression (15.4% of cases,0.004, Kaplan Meier), and an increase \n331\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nin EGFR expression (7.7%, p=0.0004, Kaplan Meier), but not \nwith phosphorylated HER2 (26.8%), phosphorylated EGFR \n(6.9%) or EGFR VII (10.3%)I.  Almost 1\/4 (23.1%) of cases \nshowed increased HER2 or EGFR expression at hormone relapse, \nthis was associated with a significant reduction in time to death \nfrom hormone relapse (3.00(1.75-4.25) versus 1.33(0.86-1.80),    \np = 0.0002, Kaplan Meier).  \nConclusion \nIncreased expression of HER2 or EGFR appears to influence \nprogression to hormone refractory prostate cancer in about a \nquarter of cases since a rise in HER2\/EGFR expression at \nhormone relapse is associated with a significant reduction in time \nto death. These findings support the development of EGFR\/HER2 \ntargeted therapies in hormone refractory prostate cancer. We have \ndemonstrated, using a carefully characterized patient cohort, that \nthe EGFR\/HER2 pathway may represent one of a number of \nindependent routes to hormone escape in prostate cancer. \n \n \nTransperitoneal or extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical \nprostatectomy: does the approach matter? \nT. Gianduzzo, C. Chang and C.

The situation with regard to \nlaparoscopic lower tract surgery remains unclear. \nMethods  \nThe results of 100 cases of transperitoneal laparoscopic \nprostatectomy (TLRP) and 100 cases of extraperitoneal \nlaparoscopic prostatectomy (ELRP) performed for \u2264T3aN0M0 \nprostate cancer were compared. \nResults \nIn-patient: mean values in TLRP & ELRP patients for operating \ntime=239 & 191 (P <0.0001) minutes, blood loss=311 & 202 \n(P=0.02) ml, hospitalisation=3.8 & 2.6 (P <0.0001) nights. \nOut-patient: mean values in TLRP & ELRP patients for follow-\nup=24.5 & 7.2 months, + margin=16% & 16%, pad-free rate at 1 \nyear=90% & 96%, erection rate at 1 year=61% & 82%. \nConclusion \nELRP is superior to TLRP with respect to operating time, blood \nloss and hospitalization.

We have evaluated a quantitative reverse transcriptase \npolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay using a combination \nof established and novel molecular markers to detect small \nnumbers of circulating prostatic cells in peripheral blood (PB) \nand bone marrow (BM). \nMaterials and Methods  \nFive nucleotide primers and probes were designed and optimised \nfor PSA, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), prostate \nstem cell antigen (PSCA), human kallikrein 2 (HK2) and DD3 \nusing the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. In vitro assay \nsensitivity was calibrated using dilutions of LNCaP cells in \nfemale PB. The PAXgene blood RNA system was optimised for \nPB and BM collection, storage and RNA isolation. Marker \nexpression was quantified in serial dilutions and limits of \ndetection determined using qRT-PCR. DD3 was also quantified \nusing a plasmid construct. Paired PB and BM samples were then \nassayed from patients with well characterised CaP and compared \nwith disease free controls. \nResults  \nAll five gene products were detected and quantified in LNCaP \ncells. Additionally, DD3 was detected in RNA derived from \nprostate biopsy samples. In vitro limits of detection were 1 \nLNCaP cell\/105 nucleated cells for PSA and PSMA, 1:104 for \nPSCA and 1:103 for HK2. The DD3 assay could detect 100 copies \nof plasmid derived RNA\/106 nucleated cells. Samples from 102 \nmen with CaP and 38 healthy controls were evaluated. The \nqualitative results are presented below, detailing the percentage \nof samples reading positive for each marker in patients with \ndifferent disease stages.

Standard prostate biopsy has a reported minor \ncomplication rate of 60-79%, major complication rate of 0.4-\n4.4% and the need for hospitalisation in 0.4-3.4% of men \n(Norberg Eur.Radiol. 1996; 6: 457, Aus Br.J.Urol. 1996; 77: 851, \nRietbergen Urology 1997; 49: 875, Rodriguez J Urol. 1998; 160: \n2115-20) and infection risk increases with age (Lindert J Urol. \n2000; 164: 76). This study examines whether prostatic biopsies \nare necessary in all men aged 80 or above. \nMethods:  \nThe pre-biopsy PSA, the DRE, the biopsy findings and staging \nbone-scan results of all men aged \u226580 years who underwent \nprostatic biopsies between 2000-2003 were reviewed. All biopsy \nsamples had been examined in one of three histopathology units \nand thirty-three consultant urologists contributed.  \nResults:  \n211 men \u2265 80 years were identified, of whom 163(77%) had \nbiopsy proven prostate cancer. 100% of 29 men with PSA \u2265100, \n98% of 47 with PSA \u226550, 97% of 77 with PSA \u226530 and 92% of \n102 with PSA \u226520ng\/ml had biopsy cores containing cancer. 63% \nof men with PSA <20ng\/ml had cancer on biopsy. In men with \ncancer and a PSA \u226530ng\/ml, 92% had Gleason grade \u22657and 93% \nwere treated with antiandrogen therapy and \/or pelvic \nradiotherapy. In all men with cancer the DRE was abnormal in \n91%, the mean number of positive cores was 59% and the bone-\nscan was positive in 18%. The DRE was abnormal in 77% of men \nwith benign biopsies.  \nConclusions  \nIn men \u2265 80 years with a PSA \u226530ng\/ml, at least 97% had \nprostate cancer, over 90% of these men had high-grade disease \nand nearly all men with cancer received active treatment.

Fenske1  \n2St George\u2019s Hospital and 1Medical School, London SW17, \n3Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial \nCollege, Faculty of Medicine, London W2 1PG \n \nIntroduction \nReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a \nsensitive molecular technique capable of detecting prostate cells \nin peripheral circulation. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is an \nexpansion of this technique, used to look at levels of gene \nexpression. Potential markers for prostate cancer (CaP) have been \nassessed using qRT-PCR with the aim of more accurate \ndiagnosis. E2F3 gene, a member of the E2F family of cell cycle \nregulatory transcription factors (Oeggerli et al. Oncogene 2004; \n23:5616-23) has been shown to be overexpressed in CaP, \ncontrolling proliferation rates and dictating CaP aggressiveness \nFurthermore E2F3 directly modulates the expression of the EZH2 \ngene, which also controls cellular proliferation and is up-\nregulated in CaP (Foster et al. Oncogene 2004; 23: 5871-9).  \nBoth genes, therefore, are potentially excellent candidate markers \nfor CaP diagnosis.   Using relative quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-\nPCR), E2F3 and EZH2 expression was analysed as potentially \naccurate markers for CaP.  \n \n \nMethods \nTotal RNA was extracted in quadruplet from blood taken from \n110 patients. cDNA synthesis was carried out, followed by qRT-\nPCR using E2F3 and EZH2 gene specific primers and the \nLightCycler\u2122 (Roche).  \nResults \nRelative qRT-PCR for E2F3 was carried out on four distinct \npatient groups, based on detailed clinicopathological information. \nE2F3 expression showed highly significant differences between \nall patient groups (P<0.001): a 39-fold increase was found in the \nlocalised prostate cancer group (LocCaP: n=51;mean= 4.67) \ncompared to benign prostatic hyperplasia group (BPH: n=8; \nmean=0.12).  Levels in the metastatic prostate cancer group \n(MetCaP: n=23; mean =1.64) were lower than the LocCaP group, \nbut still 14-fold higher than the BPH group levels.  Of particular \ninterest was the radical prostatectomy group (RP: n=18, mean = \n4.08), which showed levels of E2F3 expression similar to those \nof the LocCaP group.  This would indicate the presence of \ntumour cells in peripheral circulation, suggesting undetected \nmicrometastases.  No E2F3 expression was detected in male \ncontrol samples (n=10).  Preliminary results for EZH2 showed a \nsimilar expression profile to that of E2F3, with significant up-\nregulation in CaP patients.   \nDiscussion \nThe expression of E2F3 has been shown to be highly up-\nregulated in prostate cancer.  Results show that it can be used as a \nmarker in accurate diagnosis of CaP using the non-invasive, \nsensitive technique of qRT-PCR.   \nE2F3 has been shown to directly modulate the expression of \ncellular proliferation genes, including EZH2, and is linked to \npRB, a cell cycle protein (Huang et al Nat Genet 2003; 34:226-\n230).  It is therefore possible that the pRB-E2F3-EZH2 axis \nrepresents an underlying molecular mechanism involved in the \ndevelopment of CaP. This offers the potential of specific \ntreatment based on patient\u2019s gene expression profile. \n \n \nProstate Cancer - The MALE Perspective \nMichael G. Clarke, JRM Wilson, JD Graham, RP MacDonagh \nTaunton & Somerset Hospital, Taunton \n \nIntroduction \nIt is essential when making judgements regarding the \nmanagement of prostate cancer, that clinicians utilise both patient \nchoice and life expectancy, in addition to the available clinical \nparameters. However estimations of life expectancy, based on co-\nmorbidity, are often inaccurate and inconsistent. Whilst validated \nco-morbidity scores exist, these are often disease-specific and \ncumbersome to use. We therefore aimed to develop a computer \nsoftware program that would enable clinicians (or other members \nof the multidisciplinary team) to accurately calculate an \nindividual patient\u2019s life expectancy on the basis of their co-\nmorbid factors, with the potential for use in the clinical and MDT \nsetting. \nMaterials & methods \nIn collaboration with a professional actuary, actuarial tables were \nused in association with the \u2018numerical rating system\u2019 to derive \nmortality ratios. These evidence-based actuarial mortality ratios, \nwhich are used by the insurance industry and are continually \nupdated in line with the available medical literature, are \ncalculated on the basis of a patient\u2019s age, smoking habit and co-\nmorbidity. They can therefore provide an accurate method of life \nexpectancy assessment in patients with multiple co-morbid \nfactors. 17 medical conditions were chosen, since they \n333\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nsignificantly impacted on life expectancy and were relevant to \n>90% of patients seen in general urological outpatients clinics.  A \nuser-friendly computer program was then designed, in association \nwith professional computer programmers, to enable easy access \nto this information via a PC and\/or PDA. Using hypothetical \npatient scenarios, the program was tested to ensure ease of use \nand accuracy of results. \nResults \nA computer software model was developed: Measure of \nActuarial Life Expectancy (MALE). This was not only found to \nbe user-friendly but also derived accurate results consistent with \nthe actuarial tables integral to the program. The inputting of \npatient information, using the patient\u2019s case notes, enabled the \ncalculation of 1) Predicted life expectancy (average number of \nyears an individual of a given age is expected to live), 2) \nPercentage chance of survival to 5 years, 10 years and 15 years, \n3) Graphical presentation of these results. The option to save \nthese results and print reports was available. (NB Screenshots \nand\/or the computer program itself will be available if presented) \nConclusion \nThis computer software provides an accurate and objective \nmeasure with potential for use in outpatient clinics and \nmultidisciplinary team meetings. Research is ongoing to assess \nthe impact of this life expectancy information on the management \ndecisions of consultant urologists regarding patients with prostate \ncancer, as well as the patients\u2019 understanding of and their desire \nto know this information.  \n \n \nFunctional analysis of domain specific zero function androgen \nreceptor mutations in prostate epithelial cells \nRichard Birnie and Norman J. Maitland \nYCR Cancer Research Unit, Dept. of Biology, University of \nYork \n \nIntroduction: \nAndrogen ablation is a powerful therapy for prostate cancer until \nthe disease undergoes a transition to the hormone refractory form. \nIn a subset of disease this may be achieved by mutation of the \nandrogen receptor gene. Mutations are known to occur \nthroughout the AR gene suggesting multiple mechanisms may \nexist to achieve androgen independence. We chose two \npreviously characterised androgen receptor mutations found in \nprostate cancer to investigate the role of different protein domains \nin ligand sensitivity and AR trafficking. Specifically, a DNA \nbinding deficient mutant (AR-C619Y) and ligand binding \ndeficient mutant (AR-C784Y). \nMaterials and Methods: \nSite directed mutagenesis PCR was used to introduce point \nmutations into the androgen receptor cDNA. Wild type or \nmutated androgen receptor cDNA in the episomal vector pCEP4 \nwas transiently transfected into either PNT1A or PC3 prostate \nepithelial cell lines in which  AR is under the control of a CMV \npromoter. Protein expression and localisation was assessed by \nwestern blot and fluorescent immunocytochemistry respectively \n48h post transfection, during which period cells were exposed to \nhormones for the last 18h. The transactivation capacity of the \ndifferent mutants was analysed using flow cytometry to measure \nactivation of a promoter-EGFP reporter construct (PSA\/Pb-\nEGFP). \nResults: \nWestern Blot analysis showed that all three forms of AR are \nexpressed at the predicted molecular weight in non-malignant \nPNT1A cells and in PC3 prostate cancer cells. The wild type \nprotein is expressed at low levels in the absence of ligand in both \ncell lines and expression is increased by addition of DHT. The \nAR-C619Y and AR-C784Y mutants are expressed at high levels \nin PNT1A but show evidence of protein degradation whereas \nthese proteins are constitutively low in PC3 cells. In the absence \nof ligand all three forms of AR show cytoplasmic localisation. \nWhen treated with DHT wild type AR translocates to the nucleus \nin both PNT1A and PC3 cells as does the AR-C619Y mutant. In \nthe presence of the anti-androgen bicalutamide wild type AR and \nAR-C619Y undergo partial translocation to the nucleus while the \nAR-C784Y mutant remains cytoplasmic regardless of treatment. \nWild type androgen receptor is able to induce EGFP expression \nin response to DHT treatment in a dose dependent manner in both \nPNT1A and PC3 cells, this activity is partially inhibited by \nbicalutamide. The AR-C619Y and AR-C784Y mutant androgen \nreceptors are unable to transactivate the reporter construct. \nConclusion: \nTranscriptional transactivation by the androgen receptor can \nviewed in terms of distinct functional modules directly related to \nthe receptor structural domains. Disrupting the function of a \nsingle module can block the function of the entire receptor even if \nthe other modules remain intact. We have shown that mutation of \neither the DNA binding or Ligand binding domain independently \nis sufficient to block downstream transactivation by the androgen \nreceptor.  \n \n \nIsoliquiritigenin, a botanical COX inhibitor, suppresses \nprostate cancer cell proliferation, down regulates      \nandrogen-receptor and PSA protein expression \nSophie Chen1,2, J. Gao1,2, H. Dorota Halicka1  \n1Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, \nNY 10595,  \n2NovaSpes Research Lab, Hawthorne, NY 105322 \n \nIntroduction \nPC-SPES was a proprietary composition, comprised of refined \nextracts from 7 herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine plus \nSaw Palmetto extract.  In several trials and experiments since \n1997 its potent anti-prostate cancer activity was confirmed.   In \nthe continuing effort to isolate and investigate its biologically \nactive components and mode of action we have identified further \nactive compound Isoliquiritigenin (ISL).  This report presents our \nfindings of the in vitro mechanism of ISL.  ISL is a chalcone \nbelonging to the flavonoids family contained in the licorice root \n(one of the eight botanical components of PC SPES).  It had been \nreported for estrogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti free radical \nactivities.  However its molecular action on prostate cancer was \nunknown. \nMaterials and Methods \nMTT cell viability assay was used to evaluate the anti-\nproliferative activity of ISL towards both of the androgen \nreceptor positive (LNCaP) and negative (DU-145) prostate cancer \ncell lines.  Fluorescence microscopy (FM) was used to observe \nthe cell morphology of the cells.  To further understand the \nmechanism of action, flow cytometric and Western blot analysis \nwere employed to investigate the effect on cell cycle, protein \nlevel of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen \n(PSA).    Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used to determine the \ninhibitory activity against cyclooxgenase (COX).  \nResults \nISL exhibited a potent activity in suppressing prostate cancer cell \nproliferation.  The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) \ndetermined by MTT was 23.3 \u00b13.4 and 15. 7 \u00b12.9 \u00b5M for LNCaP \n334\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nand DU-145 respectively.  FM examination revealed an increased \nfrequency of apoptosis in both cell lines.   At concentrations \ncomparable to IC50 the flow cytometric data showed that ISL \ninduced a G1 phase arrest in LNCaP (AR positive), while it \nblocked the cell cycle at G2M phase in DU-145 cells (AR \nnegative). Western blot analysis further indicated ISL caused a \ndown regulation of AR and PSA protein expression. The anti-\ninflammatory property of ISL was found to be directly associated \nwith its strong inhibition on COX activity, with an IC50 of 10.6 \n\u00b5M for COX2.    \nConclusion \nRecent studies by various investigators confirmed the important \nrole of AR and COX in controlling prostate cancer progression \nand metastasis.  The fact that ISL is a COX inhibitor and an AR \nmodulator makes it a potential candidate for prostate cancer \nchemo preventive agent. Further investigation on its molecular \nmechanism and possible clinical benefit are warranted. \n \n \nProstate cancer stem cells \nAnne T Collins, Steven D Bryce, Katy Hyde, *Michael J Stower, \nNorman J Maitland  \nYCR Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University \nof York, York YO10 5DD *Department of Urology, York \nDistrict Hospital, York \n \nIt is important to recognize that solid tumours are more than just \na clonal expansion of mutant cells, but are instead heterogeneous \nand structurally complex.   \nIn this larger framework, tumour progression can be considered a \ndevelopmental process in which a complex multicellular organ \nforms from rare tumour-initiating stem cells and evolving \ninteractions with the microenvironment.  In order to study these \nrare tumour-initiating cells we have identified markers present on \nnormal stem cells that are also present on prostate cancer cells.   \nThe HEA+\/CD44+,\u001f2\u001f1hi\/CD133+ cells, selected from a series of \nprimary and metastatic prostate cancers (n= 27; Gleason 5-6 (6), \nGleason 7 (16), Gleason 8-10 (5) proliferate extensively in vitro, \nand comprise of 0.01% of the tumour population. The phenotype, \nHEA+\/CD44+,\u001f2\u001f1hi\/CD133+ are clonogenic in soft agar, unlike \ntheir more differentiated progeny. The cancer cells display stem \ncell-like properties in that they are capable of generating new \nclones containing additional stem cells, as well as regenerating \nphenotypically mixed populations of non-clonogenic cells present \nin the original tumours \nTherefore, if the initiating cell is indeed the stem cell, therapies \nthat are more specifically directed at cancer stem cells should \nresult in more durable responses for primary as well as metastatic \ndisease.   \n \n \nLongitudinal changes in bone mineral density in advanced \nprostate cancer patients treated with androgen ablation or \nanti- androgen hormonal therapy and testosterone recovery \nfollowing cessation of LH-RH analogues \nWadhwa VK, Weston R, Hussain A, Parr NJ. \nArrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, UK \n \nIntroduction  \nAndrogen ablation with LH-RH analogues decrease serum \ntestosterone levels and hence bone mineral density (BMD). They \nhave been associated with accelerated bone loss and osteoporosis. \nAn alternative is the anti-androgen bicalutamide which acts at the \nandrogen receptor. Our aim was to study the effects of these 2 \ntreatments on the BMD of selected groups of patients. In an \nattempt to reduce further demineralization, patients found to be \nosteoporotic while receiving LH-RH analogues were converted to \nanti-androgen monotherapy.  \nMaterials and Methods  \n367 men (mean age 73years, range 53-93) with prostate cancer \nrequiring hormone manipulation were prospectively followed \nfrom Oct 1999 to Aug 2004. BMD of the forearm was measured \nby dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) prior to hormone \ntherapy and annually thereafter. Osteoporotic patients (t-score\u2264-\n2.5) were commenced on bicalutamide. Osteopenic (t-score -1.0 \nto -2.4) and normal (t-score>-1.0) patients were treated with LH-\nRH analogues.15 osteoporotic patients receiving \u226512 months of \nLH-RH analogue were converted to anti- angrogen monotherapy. \nPSA and total testosterone were monitored at 3 monthly intervals.  \nResults  \nOsteoporosis was found in 42% of men with newly diagnosed \nprostate cancer prior to hormones. The osteoporotic group \n(n=155) did not show a significant change in BMD. (t-score at \nbaseline -3.54;year1 -3.64; year2 -3.52; year3 -3.64; year4 -3.78). \nThe osteopenic group (n=140) showed a statistically significant \ndecrease in BMD, with 60% developing osteoporosis after 2 \nyears on LH-RH analogues. (t-score at baseline -1.72; year1 -\n2.02; year2 -2.59; year3 -2.69; year4 -2.94). The normal BMD \npatients (n=72) also showed a significant decrease in BMD. (t-\nscore at baseline -0.25; year1 -0.58; year2 -0.83 ;year3 -1.28; \nyear4 -1.52). \nAll 15 patients converted to Bicalutamide demonstrated some \ntestosterone recovery. Mean duration to initial detectable \ntestosterone was 12.8 months(range6-22). Only 6 achieved a \nnormal testosterone level after a mean of 17.5 months (range 14-\n30).   \nConclusion  \nOur data showed that patients treated with androgen ablation \nshowed a significant decrease in BMD whereas those on anti-\nandrogen therapy maintained their BMD. We would advocate the \nroutine assessment of BMD prior to hormone manipulation and \nsurveillance thereafter to identify osteoporosis. This can be \nfactored into the decision making process regarding the choice of \nandrogen deprivation therapy.  \nAs regards patients already on LH-RH analogues, following \ncessation of these, testosterone levels continue to be suppressed. \nConversion to anti-androgen does not offer a significant benefit \nand we would suggest studies of alternative therapies such as \nbisphosphonates.  \n                                                \n \n \n335\nProstate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases\nAbstracts\nBritish Prostate Group\n"}
