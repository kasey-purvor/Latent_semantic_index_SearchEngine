INTRODUCTION\nA general approach has recently been proposed @1,2# for\nthe detection of phase synchronization ~or its absence! be-\ntween two or more interacting processes based on the analy-\nsis of univariate data. The approach consists in extracting\nreturn times from a continuous one-dimensional observable,\nreconstructing the return times map by delay embedding, and\nextracting phase angles. In the immediately preceding paper\n@2#, hereinafter referred to as Part I, we demonstrated ana-\nlytically and numerically that for two interacting processes\nthese angles are in one-to-one correspondence with the con-\nventional phase difference, and can thus be taken as an indi-\ncation of synchronization or otherwise. The same method\nwas also extended to the case of several processes interacting\nin the presence of noise, and its workability was illustrated\nnumerically for the case of three processes.\nIn the present paper we apply this approach to heart-rate-\nvariability ~HRV! data from healthy human subjects in order\nto learn whether or not synchronization occurs for three of\nthe most significant processes operating within the cardio-\nvascular system, namely, the main heart rhythm, respiration,\nand the process whose basic frequency is close to 0.1 Hz.\nThe HRV data are in the form of R-R intervals extracted from\nelectrocardiogrammes ~ECGs!.\nII. DESCRIPTION OF DATA\nFigure 1~a! shows a typical human ECG. The so-called R\npeaks, which are the largest ones, are indicated. The time\nintervals Ti between the two successive R peaks are usually\ncalled R-R intervals. They represent the time intervals be-\ntween the two consecutive heart beats and in terms of non-\nlinear dynamics the time intervals between the trajectory\u2019s\nreturn to a secant plane defined by the value of a threshold,\ni.e., return times. It is widely accepted that the human ECG\nhas rather complex Fourier ~and wavelet! spectra with well-\ndistinguished characteristic peaks, three of them being espe-\ncially noticeable: a schematic Fourier power spectrum for a\ntypical ECG is shown in Fig. 1~b!. Usually these peaks are1063-651X\/2002\/65~3!\/036212~7!\/$20.00 65 0362associated with the rhythmic activity of certain physiological\nprocesses within cardiovascular system ~CVS!: f ahr defines\nthe average heart rate; f resp is associated with respiration pro-\ncess; the origin of f 2;0.1 Hz is not quite clear at present\u2014it\nis variously attributed to the sympathetic and parasympa-\nthetic nervous activity @3#, to the baroreflex loop @4#, and to\nthe intrinsic myogenic activity of the vascular smooth\nmuscles @5#. At least two more distinguishable spectral\npeaks, at frequencies of about 0.01 and 0.03 Hz ~not shown\nhere!, have recently been recognized @5#. However, on the\nsmall observation times with which we deal in the present\nresearch, they cannot be detected with confidence and, in the\nframework of this paper, we will treat them as additional\nmanifestations of nonstationarity.\nQualitatively the same Fourier spectra can be obtained @6#\nfrom R-R intervals using a technique suggested in @7#.\nThus, the dynamics of R-R intervals result from the com-\nplex interaction of several processes with different times-\ncales. With the exception of respiration and heart rate, there\nis usually ~but cf. @8#! no possibility of gaining any knowl-\nedge about the phase or amplitude relationships between\nthem with the use of noninvasive methods. It is, therefore,\ninteresting to find out whether our technique can be helpful\nin order to detect the presence or absence of phase synchro-\nnization between the processes involved based solely on\nstudies of the sequences of R-R intervals.\nFIG. 1. ~a! Typical human electrocardiogram ~ECG!. ~b!

Each ECG was reg-\nistered while the subject was resting in an armchair, over a\nperiod of 5\u201310 min, using a sampling rate of 180 Hz. For a\ntest example of bivariate data, where both ECG and respira-\ntion signals were required, measurements were made at Lan-\ncaster University during 3 min with a sampling rate of 400\nHz from a young healthy subject undergoing paced respira-\ntion with frequency of 0.5 Hz.\nIII. REMOVING THE FLOATING AVERAGE VALUE\nAs it was noted in Part I ~Ref. 45! the return times of a\nnonstationary process usually oscillate around some ran-\ndomly floating average value. In terms of the angles of return\ntimes map it means that the origin of this map is floating\nrandomly. Angles extracted from such data are usually highly\ndisordered and the useful phase information appears to be\nsmeared. We are interested in the oscillations of return times\naround the average value, thus in order to gain \u2018\u2018clean\u2019\u2019 phase\ninformation we advocate removal of this floating origin from\nreturn times prior to the extraction of angles. Any one of\nseveral existing methods can be used for this purpose, but\nhere we discuss just two of them. We first show how they\ntransform purely noisy data when no interactions take place\n~Sec. III B!, and then demonstrate their effect on a typical\nexample of human HRV data ~Sec. IV!.\nA. Description of filtering methods\nIn the present paper we use two different methods. The\nfirst of these consists of computing the analog of the second\nderivative of the original discrete time series x(i),\nxder~ i !5\nx~ i11 !1x~ i21 !22x~ i !\n2 . ~1!\nLet us refer to this method as to the method of derivatives.\nThe second method is an extension of the well-known\ndetrending technique. A local average is defined within a\ntemporal window moving along the dataset which is then\ndeduced from each datapoint. The only distinction of our\nmethod is that the size of the temporal window is not con-\nstant along the dataset. One window includes all points be-\ntween two successive extrema ~maximum and minimum,\netc.! of a discrete signal, including the extrema themselves.\nAfter the local average is computed within each window, its\nvalue is attributed to the time in the middle of the window.\nAll such averages are then connected by straight lines by\nmeans of linear interpolation. Finally, from each original\ndatapoint the value of the resultant graph is deduced @see\nalso Fig. 3~c!#. In what follows we will call this technique\nthe method of differences.\nFurther, while plotting the filtered discrete data we will\nadd them to the average value of the original unfiltered\ndataset.\nB. Noisy oscillatory process without any interaction\nBefore attempting to apply our technique in practice to\ninvestigate interactions between oscillatory processes we03621first need to know how the map of angles of return times\nbehaves in the case when there are no deterministic interac-\ntions between processes being close to periodic, i.e., where\nonly one noisy periodic oscillatory process occurs. Consider\nthe Van der Pol oscillator in the presence of noise, i.e., Eq.\n~2! of Part I in the absence of external forcing (C50), with\nnoise intensity D50.000 01, e50.1, and v51. Let us record\ntimes t i when the phase trajectory intersects the level x50 in\none direction. The map for return times is presented in Fig.\n2~a! while the map for angles of return times in Fig. 2~b!. It\nis easy to be convinced that the latter map contains no struc-\nture by comparing it with those of Figs. 3 or 6 of Part I,\nrepresenting Eqs. ~11! or ~19!, respectively.\nIn order to check that the distinct structure that may ap-\npear in map for angles is not merely due to the filtration\nprocedures that we have used, we now apply the above filters\nto these purely noisy data. The results obtained after filtration\nare presented in Fig. 3~a! and 3~b!. The presence of some\nstructure in the resulting angles maps is quite obvious here\u2014\nthough it is far from being one dimensional, and neither is\nthere any possibility of modeling these maps by means of\nEq. ~19! in Part I. Note that the points concentrate in very\nspecific regions, namely, between the return functions of Eq.\n~11! in Part I for j5 13 and j5 12 shown by gray dashed lines,\nand that they fill densely the interior and the vicinity of this\nFIG. 2.

In ~c! the\noperation of filtering by differences is illustrated for the noise data.2-2\nPHASE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN . . . . II. . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036212region. A typical feature of these maps is the existence of\nrelatively sharp cusps pointing away from the diagonal. The\norigin of this structure can be explained phenomenologically\nusing the basic property of white noise, namely, the nondif-\nferentiability of its time series. That means that differences\nbetween the subsequent points change from negative to posi-\ntive very quickly. The probability of finding two successive\nlocal maxima ~or minima! being separated by only one or\ntwo points is much larger than the probability of finding a\nwider separation. An illustration of how the differences tech-\nnique works in this case is given in Fig. 3~c!. In the upper\nplot the original dataset is shown together with the local\naverage. After subtracting the latter one obtains a time series\noscillating around zero with the current period varying ran-\ndomly between 2 or 3. In terms of angles maps this means\nrandom ~and rapid! jumping between the return functions\nshown in Figs. 3~a! and 3~b!. Of course, due to total random-\nness of the data, the whole map appears to be very noisy. The\nperformance of derivatives technique can be explained in a\nsimilar way. Thus, if the shape of the angles map is similar to\nthat presented in Fig. 3, we will consider these data as purely\nnoisy.\nIV. STAGES OF DATA PROCESSING\nThe stages in the processing of the measured R-R inter-\nvals are illustrated in Fig. 4.\nAn original sequence of R-R intervals is plotted ~Fig. 4,\nfirst row, first column!. As usual, there is a slow variation of\nthe average value, attributable to processes of very low fre-\nquency ~less than 0.1 Hz! which, over small observation\ntimes, can often be treated as nonstationarity. On the top\nFIG. 4. This figure illustrates the successive stages of R-R data\nprocessing and compares the two filtering techniques for a healthy\nsubject at rest. Details are discussed in the text.03621right is shown the Fourier power spectrum of the original\nHRV data @6,7#. The largest peak corresponds to the main\nheart rhythm f ahr . Both this and the others of smaller ampli-\ntude are rather broad, presumably due to the nonstationarity.\nCorrespondingly, the map of successive R-R intervals, being\njust the return times map ~Fig. 4, first row, second column!,\nusually has no distinct structure.\nThe angles f i are extracted from the return times map\n~Fig. 4, second row, first column!, having placed the origin at\nthe center of mass. A typical map for angles is as shown in\nFig. 4 ~second row, second column!, where the points fall\nclose to the diagonal near coordinate positions ~p\/4; p\/4! and\n~23p\/4; 23p\/4! due to the predominance of very low-\nfrequency oscillations influencing the heart rate @compare\nwith Fig. 6~a! of Part I#.\nIn order to concentrate on interactions of the main rhythm\nwith respiration and the process with frequency ;0.1 Hz, we\nneed to reduce the effect of very low frequencies and subject\nthe original sequence of R-R intervals to filtration. The re-\nsults of applying two filters described in Sec. III A usually\ndiffer slightly, and so in practice we compute the power\nspectrum for the each of the filtered data sets xder or xdiff in\norder to control the effect of filtering. In Fig. 4, rows three\nand four show the results of filtering by means of differ-\nences, while rows five and six illustrate the workability of\nderivatives technique. The corresponding power spectra are\nshown at the end of each pair of rows. To compute the Fou-\nrier spectrum from filtered R-R intervals we just add to xder\nor xdiff the average value of unfiltered R-R intervals, and then\nproceed in the same way as for original, nonfiltered data @6#.\nThe methods of differences and derivatives both remove the\ntrend from the data, leading to return times maps ~rows three\nand five! of similar appearance. However, the noisy back-\nground of the power spectrum seems on average to be more\nuniform after filtration by derivatives, than by differences,\nalthough the use of derivatives leads to a more significant\ndecrease of the lower-frequency range ~around 0.1 Hz and\nless!. In both cases, two dominating frequencies and their\ncombinations are clearly seen after filtration, but the ratios of\ntheir amplitudes appear to be slightly different. Note, that the\nderivatives technique is dangerous for data where the respi-\nration frequency is less than a quarter of average heart rate.\nFor such data we would recommend the use of differences as\nbeing the safer method.\nThe angles f i are extracted from the maps of filtered\nreturn times, and the map for angles ~1! from Part I is plotted\n~Fig. 4, rows four and six!. For the case considered, both\nangles maps seem to lie in the vicinity of the same curve\nbeing the return function of Eq. ~11! for in Part I j5 14 ~com-\npare with Fig. 4!. So both methods of filtration allow the\nstructure of angles map in this example to be revealed more\nor less equally. Both of the \u2018\u2018filtered\u2019\u2019 angles maps represent\nsmeared continuous curves, and are definitely not formed by\nisolated clouds of points, thus testifying to the absence of\nsynchronization between heart rate and the most dominant of\nthe other processes ~which in the present case seems to be\nrespiration!. The rotation number j01 is estimated from\nEq. ~21! of Part I to be ^j&50.246 . . . for differences\nand ^j&50.264 . . . for derivatives.2-3\nJANSON, BALANOV, ANISHCHENKO, AND McCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036212For further analysis of real data we select whichever filter\nleads to the more pronounced structure in the map for angles.\nOf course, neither of the filtration techniques described is\nperfect, and other techniques could be used instead to obtain\nsimilar or perhaps even better results.\nAlong with angles, the instantaneous radii were also ex-\ntracted from the human R-R intervals at each stage of pro-\ncessing. In Fig. 5 the maps for radii ri are shown for the\nsame human data as in Fig. 4: for nonfiltered R-R intervals\n~a!, for those filtered by differences ~b! and by derivatives\n~c!. Unlike the angles f i , the radii ri usually behaved in a\nrather disordered way, thus smearing the map of R-R inter-\nvals significantly. This remained true regardless of whether\nraw or filtered HRV data were used.\nAs shown in Part I, the map for angles of return times\nallows one to make a judgement about synchronization ~or\nits absence! between the main rhythm and the other process\nwith smaller amplitude, interaction with which is dominant.\nIn the CVS the role of this second rhythm is usually played\nby respiration. The third rhythm often present in human HRV\ndata has a basic frequency f 2 that is close to 0.1 Hz and an\namplitude comparable with or lower than that due to respi-\nration. In order to obtain information about interaction be-\ntween respiration and the latter process, if it manifests itself\nin the power spectrum, we may finally proceed as suggested\nin Sec. III C of Part I, namely: extract the local maxima from\nthe sequences of R-R intervals; filter the set of maxima by\none or another technique; and then plot their map.\nV. TESTING FILTERING ON SURROGATE DATA\nNow, let us test filtering more thoroughly with the help of\nsurrogate data @9#. We are interested in the application of our\nmethod to data possessing the same Fourier power spectrum\nas real R-R intervals, but which is otherwise random. We\nobtained a set of surrogates for the dataset illustrated in Fig.\n4 using the program surrogates from the TISEAN complex\ndeveloped by the authors of this method @10#, and then sub-\njected it to all the same stages of processing. The results are\npresented in Fig. 6. Fourier spectra of either original or fil-\ntered surrogate data possess peaks at the same frequencies as\nthe spectra of the reference data. They are of similar ampli-\ntude ~compare the spectra in Figs. 4 and 6!, although not\nexactly the same, possibly due to the method of computing\nthe spectrum used here @7#, which is not the fast Fourier\ntransform used in @10#.\nThe angles maps look similar to those obtained for the\npurely random data of Figs. 3~a! and 3~b!, and obviously\nFIG. 5. Map of radii of return times for the subject illustrated by\nFig. 12 for ~a! nonfiltered R-R intervals, ~b! R-R intervals filtered by\ndifferences, ~c! R-R intervals filtered by derivatives.03621differ markedly from the corresponding maps derived from\nthe reference data in Fig. 4.\nVI. ANGLES OF RETURN TIMES MAP AND PHASE\nDIFFERENCE FOR HRV DATA\nIn Part I an explicit correspondence between the conven-\ntional phase difference and the angles of return times map\nwas derived analytically and, what is of particular impor-\ntance for us here, confirmed for a simulated nonstationary\nprocess with floating eigenfrequency of oscillations. Here we\nattempt to establish the same correspondence for real bio-\nlogical data. In order to evoke a regime of effective phase\nsynchronization with the same rotation number j51\/3 as in\nthe numerical simulation illustrated in Fig. 7 of Part I, we\nasked a healthy volunteer to breath at a frequency of 0.5 Hz,\nand measured both the ECG and respiration signals simulta-\nneously. The Fourier power spectrum of the HRV for this\nsubject is given in Fig. 7, where the two main processes\nexhibit themselves through the presence of the peaks at f ahr ,\nf resp , and their combinations 2 f resp5 f ahr2 f resp . Thus, we\nFIG. 6. This figure illustrates the successive stages of processing\nof surrogate data for the dataset illustrated in Fig. 4 and compares\nthe two filtering techniques. Details are discussed in the text.\nFIG. 7. Fourier power spectrum of a datafile of a subject under-\ngoing paced respiration at frequency 0.5 Hz. Two rhythmic pro-\ncesses dominate: the main cardiac rhythm and respiration.2-4\nPHASE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN . . . . II. . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036212can suppose that if any synchronization between heart rate\nand respiration takes place it has the order 1\/3. We now\nproceed to analyze these data in exactly the same way as\ndescribed in Sec. III A of Part I.\nFirst, we undertake a conventional type of synchroniza-\ntion analysis, computing from the bivariate data the phase\ndifference DF i5fahr(t i)23f resp(t i) @Fig. 8~a!#. The mo-\nments t i correspond to the appearance of R peaks in the ECG\nwhen its phase changes by 2p, and the phase of respiration\nsignal is taken as the phase angle of a phase portrait recon-\nstructed by a suitable delay embedding from the respiration\nsignal. We then construct the relative phase C i and its map\n@Figs. 8~b! and 8~c!, respectively#. In Figs. 8~a! and 8~b! we\ncan notice several horizontal segments testifying to the oc-\ncurrence of phase locking, and intervals where two phases\nslide against each other, i.e., are not locked.\nSecondly, we perform the new type of synchronization\nanalysis proposed in Part I, restricting ourselves to univariate\ndata only. We choose for the latter the R-R intervals extracted\nfrom the ECG. We filter them by the derivatives method,\nextract angles f i and plot their map @Figs. 8~d! and 8~e!,\nrespectively#. Finally, we transform f i using Eq. ~8! of Part\nI to \u2018\u2018reconstruct\u2019\u2019 the relative phase C i* whose temporal\ndependence and map are shown in Figs. 8~f! and 8~g!, re-\nspectively @11#.\nThe striking similarity between the plots in Figs. 8~b! and\n8~f!, and 8~c! and 8~g! provides a convincing demonstration\nthat the angles of a return times map are able to provide the\nsame information as conventional phase difference and rela-\ntive phase. In other words, we have indeed been able to\nFIG. 8. Comparison of different methods used for the detection\nof phase synchronization in the human cardiovascular system.

SOME EXAMPLES OF EXPERIMENTAL ANGLE\nMAPS\nIn this section we present and discuss two examples of\ndifferent phase and amplitude relationships between the three\nprocesses interacting within the CVSs of particular subjects.\nThe first example is illustrated by Fig. 9. The R-R inter-\nvals are subjected to filtering by differences here, and the\ncorresponding angles map in given in Fig. 9~a!. The Fourier\nspectrum @Fig. 9~c!# reveals three distinct frequency compo-\nnents f ahr , f resp , and f 2 , and the angles map ~a! is not close\nto any one-dimensional curve. Neither does it contain iso-\nlated clouds of points, so one can be confident that there is\nno phase locking between the main heart rhythm and respi-\nration. Since there are three rhythms involved in the interac-\ntion, there are two independent rotation numbers, namely, j01\nfor the interaction between heart beat and respiration, and j12\nfor the interaction between respiration and the process with\nfrequency f 2 . Formula ~21! of Part I, which is suitable for\nonly two interacting processes, is not expected to provide a\nreliable estimate for any of the true \u2018\u2018partial\u2019\u2019 rotation num-\nbers. However, the average rotation number ^j&50.2060...\nseems to lie close to the ratio of the heart rate and respiration\nfrequency.\nNow, consider the interaction between respiration and the\nprocess with f 2 . Extract local maxima from the original se-\nquence of R-R intervals, filter them by derivatives; extract\nangles, and create their map @Fig. 9~b!#. A one-dimensional\nstructure is quite evident here, although it cannot be de-\nscribed by Eq. ~11! in Part I ~cf. the plots in Fig. 3 of Part I!.\nThe probable reason is that the amplitude of the process with\nf 2 is not much less than that of respiration, but is comparable\nwith it. Thus approximation of Eq. ~11! in Part I is no longer\nvalid, and we have no right to apply formula ~21! of Part I to\nestimate the rotation number. The observed map contains no\nisolated groups of points and can be taken as evidence for the\nabsence of phase locking between respiration and f 2 . Thus,\nin the example considered no two of the three processes in-\nvolved are synchronized with each other.\nFIG. 9.

The power\nspectrum @Fig. 10~c!# contains distinguishable components of\nthe main rhythm f ahr and respiration f resp , and much less\npronounced combination frequencies f ahr6 f 2 . The first\nangles map @Fig. 10~a!# reveals a structure that is close to\nbeing one dimensional but which is not, however, captured\nby model ~11! in Part I ~compare with plots in Fig. 3!. The\nreason is that, as in case of Fig. 10~b!, interaction between\nthe main process and respiration cannot be treated as weak;\nthe latter conclusion is supported by the presence at rela-\ntively large amplitude of second harmonics of the respiration\nfrequency 2 f resp and also the combination frequency ( f ahr\n22 f resp). In this case too we cannot estimate the rotation\nnumber j01 by means of Eq. ~21! of Part I. However, in spite\nof the rather strong interaction, no synchronization between\nthe basic process and respiration can be detected, since the\nangles map is close to a continuous curve. We now eliminate\nthe main rhythm by selecting local maxima of R-R intervals,\nfilter them by derivatives, and plot the corresponding map\nfor angles @Fig. 10~b!#. It clearly contains several isolated\nclouds of points, whose exact number will be discussed be-\nlow: they constitute evidence of phase locking between the\nprocesses considered. The average rotation number j12 can\nbe estimated as ^j&50.3936 . . . that is close to 2\/5.\nSince the numerator of the rotation number, if synchroni-\nzation exists, seems to be n52, let us apply the technique\nused in Ref. @12# to detect phase locking. Namely, unwrap\nthe angles allowing them to increase monotonically, and then\nwrap them into an interval @22p ; 2p# that is twice as large\nas @2p; p# @Fig. 11~a!#. Now, compute the probability den-\nsity for this dependence @Fig. 11~b!#. We find that it posseses\n5 distinct peaks. This allows us to infer the existence of 2\/5\nsynchronization between respiration and the process with f 2 ,\nat least in the statistical sense @12#.\nVIII. MODELING ANGLES OF R-R INTERVALS\nLet us apply the theoretical map ~19! of Part I to simulate\nthe observed angles maps. For simplicity we set all phase\nFIG. 10.

First, we simulate the map of Fig. 8~e! by\nsetting frequencies v051, V151\/3, V250.1; amplitudes\nA150.1, A250.01; the intensity of Gaussian white noise\nmodulating the value of V1 as D50.00002, the noise added\nto the right-hand part of model map D50.06, and also some\n\u2018\u2018measurement noise\u2019\u2019 added to the solution with intensity\nD50.05. Since the number of points in Fig. 8 is about 200,\nfor a good comparison the same number of points of the map\n~19! in Part I with the given parameter values are presented\nin Fig. 12~a!. The two phase portraits are evidently very\nsimilar.\nSecondly, we simulate the case of Fig. 10~b! by setting:\nfrequencies v051, V150.4, V250.112... ~a long random\nsequence of numbers from 1 to 9!; amplitudes A150.2, A2\n50.05; and the intensity of Gaussian white noise added to\nthe equation D50.001. 100 points of the resulting phase\nportrait are given in Fig. 12~b!: the result looks remarkably\nsimilar to that in Fig. 10~b!. Note, that the rotation number\nj12 here is set to exactly 2\/5, and the tendency to merge for\nthe two clouds of points furthest to the right is clearly seen.\nThis latter example serves as an argument supporting our\ninference of 2\/5 phase locking between respiration and f 2 .\nThus, the derived general map ~18! from Part I @and its\nparticular case ~19!# allows the dynamics of real cardiovas-\ncular signals to be modeled, at least in those cases where the\nmain process interacts sufficiently weakly with the others.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nThe results presented in some sense contradict to the ear-\nlier conclusion @13# that no distinct structure arises in the\nangles maps of human R-R intervals in the case of spontane-\nous breathing, and can appear only for paced respiration at\nFIG. 11. ~a!

We have demonstrated above\nthat, although structure cannot be seen in the raw results,\nfiltration of the data to remove the floating average value\nenables distinct structure to be observed for most healthy\nsubjects. Thus, the deterministic structure revealed in angles\nmap of filtered R-R intervals is the evidence of deterministic\ninteraction between heart rate and, most probably, respiration\nand the oscillatory process at 0.1 Hz.\nX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the results presented above, we arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions:\n~1! In experimental heart-rate-variability data of healthy\nhumans, the instantaneous radii ri are rather disordered,\nwhereas the angles f i of return times reveal much determin-\nism in most of the cases considered.\n~2! The majority of the HRV data analyzed were success-\nfully modeled by the formulas ~11! and ~19! of Part I which\nwas derived for the case of weak interaction. That means that\ninteraction of the processes involved can be considered\nweak.\n~3! There are some data that contain distinct structure that\nis not captured by our models, thus revealing the existence of\nstronger interactions in some cases.\n~4! The technique presented allows one to study synchro-03621nization between at least three processes interacting within\nthe cardiovascular system.\nThe cardiovascular system is a particularly striking ex-\nample of a system within which several oscillatory processes\ninteract, mutually influencing each other. With the exception\nof respiration and the main cardiac rhythm, there is no pos-\nsibility of separating the signals from the individual pro-\ncesses in order to compare them and assess their synchroni-\nzation, or the lack of it, using conventional techniques. We\nhave suggested and justified theoretically a tool @1,2# to\nstudy interacting rhythms in the cardiovascular system using\nonly heart rate variability data. We expect that the same ap-\nproach will be equally applicable to the other kinds of bio-\nmedical signals with less or comparably complex structure.\nWe hope that the proposed approach may prove to have po-\ntential for future applications and the development of new\ncriteria for use in medical diagnostics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are much indebted to Dr. Alexander Neiman for valu-\nable discussions and for his constructive comments on a draft\nversion of the manuscript.
