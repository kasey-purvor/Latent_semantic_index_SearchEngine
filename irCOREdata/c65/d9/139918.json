This study uses a social network\nperspective to examine the triad management phenomenon in the military avionics maintenance context, which is\nclosely associated with the field of operations management.\nMethodology \u2013 The study uses an exploratory case study approach. By adopting the triad-level as the unit of\nanalysis, thirteen triads across fifteen companies in a supply network were analysed. The entire population was\ncovered, by studying the dominant network actor in the military avionics maintenance industry in Taiwan, and its 14\npartners. 68 interview transcription pages resulted from 150 hours of face-to-face and telephone interviews. In\naddition, informal interviews, interviews with other network employees and in-situ document analyses support the\nresearch.\nFindings and implications - This research demonstrates that different triad structures and management mechanisms\ninfluence perceived cooperative performance. Four main findings emerged: (1) In a triad, a firm playing a bridging\nrole perceives higher cooperative performance than playing a peripheral role in the triad or being located in a\nfully-connected triad. (2) When a firm plays the bridging role in triad and high level of trust, lead to higher\nperceived cooperative performance. (3) When a firm plays a peripheral role in triad, high levels of coordination\nmechanism combined with high levels of trust, result in higher levels of perceived cooperative performance. (4) In a\nfully-linked triad, when the coordination mechanism is well developed, the level of trust is high, so that the resulting\nlevel of perceived cooperation is high.\nOriginality\/value - This research extends our knowledge of triad management by providing an in-depth study of a\nwell-defined network setting with exceptionally high-level access to the most senior executives. In practice, this\nstudy shows how to manage different triads.\nLimitations \u2013 The study is based on thirteen triads within a very focused and specific context.\nKeywords Supply network, Triad structure, Management mechanism, Military avionics maintenance industry,\nService maintenance.\nPaper type Research paper\n3Introduction\nStrategic alliances and networks in the field of operations management are becoming more important (Giunipero,\nHandfield, Eltantawy, 2006; Karlsson, 2003). The introduction of the term \"network\" into the supply chain\nmanagement (SCM) field (Pilkinton and Fitzgerald, 2006; Taylor and Taylor, 2009) has extended the supply chain\nmanagement concept into more strategic fields (Mills, Schmitz and Frizelle, 2004). In theory, networks and alliances\nare considered voluntary and cooperative inter-firm agreements, aimed at achieving competitive advantages for the\npartners (Zajac and Olsen, 1993; Gulati, 1998; Das and Teng, 2000). In practice, companies have formed various\ninter-organisational alliances in order to seek advantages in purchasing, R&D, design, production, and distribution.\nIn an era in which networks and alliances are prevailing in practice, managing strategic inter-firm linkages is a\nsignificant task and challenge for managers, particularly in the operations management field.\nWhile much research has been devoted to supply chain management and the inter-firm supply network in\noperations management, less attention has been paid to managing structural positions in cooperative alliances and\nnetworks. On the one hand, in the strategic management field, research has focused on network structures and\nanalysis at the intra-organisational level (e.g., Tsai, 2002), organisational level (Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999), and\ndyadic level (e.g., Gulati, 1995). On the other hand, in the operations management field, Mills et al. (2004) focused\non a four-level framework for supply chain management (Harland, 1996): an internal chain at Level 1, a dyadic\nrelationship at Level 2, external chain at Level 3, and network at Level 4. Despite this research, one level, the triadic\nrelationship, has been largely ignored. A review of both the strategic management and operations management\nliterature reveals that little work addresses the triadic level in the strategic network and supply network research.\nAccording to Madhavan, Gnyawali, and He's (2004) \"A triad is a set of three actors and the possible ties\namong them.\" Studying triads is becoming increasingly important for enhancing our understanding of networks as a\nwhole, because the triad occupies an intermediate level in network analysis (Madhavan et al., 2004) and represents a\ncore structure at a high level (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Despite Madhavan et al.\u2019s (2004) emphasis on the\nimportance of triad-level analysis, the business networks research has not examined the issue of triad management.\nThe complexity and diversity of triad structures suggest that this field requires future research.\nFrom both practical and theoretical perspectives, the lack of empirical evidence on managing different triads\nin a network has limited the understanding of the supply network phenomenon. Therefore, we have applied the\nstrategic management and social network perspectives to the operations management field. The objective is to\n4explore how firms implement strategies, so as to manage structural positions within a strategic supply network, in\norder to survive in the military avionics maintenance industry. By investigating 13 triads in a given supply network\nin the Taiwan military avionics service maintenance industry, this research investigates how the focal company\nembedded in different triads adopts management mechanisms for generating improved cooperative performance.\nAccordingly, our research question is twofold:\n(1) How do different triad structures within a supply network, affect cooperative performance?\n(2) From the perspective of a focal company, how do management mechanisms affect cooperative\nperformance?\nThe study examines the research questions from the focal company perspective. Within and across the triads,\nactors occupying different structural positions may use different management mechanisms and perceive different\nperformance. In order to answer the above research questions, two main streams of literature are examined. These\nare the triadic structures and management mechanisms in supply networks. As a result, three types of triads and two\npropositions are identified from literature. These triad types are then used as a basis for collecting and comparing\ndata from thirteen different triads across the fifteen network actors. Then the results are analysed and discussed, and\npractical implications drawn. The paper contributes with two propositions and four findings. Finally, it concludes by\nrevisiting the original research questions and discussing the limitations and some possible directions for future\nresearch.\nThis research contributes to the field in three ways. Firstly, it provides an empirical study of triads, which is\nimportant for an emerging field. Secondly, the respondents were all well-informed chief executives and directors;\nwe are indebted to them for the level of access provided. Thirdly, within a very specific context, we managed to\ncover the entire population.\nBackground\nWe commence by reviewing the literature, in order to understand the triadic structures and management mechanisms\nin supply networks.\nTriads\nAs mentioned above, a triad comprises a set of three actors and the potential ties between them (Madhavan et al.,\n2004). According to Wasserman and Faust (1994) and Gulati and Gargiulo (1999), a focal actor can be involved in\n5six different triads with two other actors; specifically.\n\uf096 Triad 1: all three actors are disconnected;\n\uf096 Triad 2: focal actor is connected to only one of the two other disconnected actors;\n\uf096 Triad 3: focal actor is connected to two other disconnected actors;\n\uf096 Triad 4: focal actor faces two other connected actors, but has no connection to either;\n\uf096 Triad 5: focal actor is connected to one of two other connected actors;\n\uf096 Triad 6: all three actors are connected.\nFigure 1 illustrates the six triads. Triads 1 and 4 are defined as isolated roles; Triad 2 shows only one\nconnection among three actors, so it is defined as a dyad, but not a triad. Therefore, only Triads 3, 5, and 6 represent\ntriad structures of which Triad 6 represents a full connection. Triad 3 is typical of the central role, because the focal\nactor is located in a structural hole and forms a bridge between two other disconnected actors. In contrast, Triad 5\nshows that the focal actor is in the peripheral position in the triad.\n\"Take in Figure 1\"\nTriadic structural positions in supply networks\nThe IJOPM citation analysis reported by Pilkinton and Fitzgerald (2006) concluded that supply chain management\n(SCM) evolved into a formal discipline around 1999. As part of this evolution, the SCM concept has changed, and\nthus the term \"network\" came into use. This extended the SCM concept into more strategic management (Mills et al.,\n2004; Harland et al., 2006) and other functional perspectives (Cigolini, Cozzi and Perona, 2004). The strategic\nmanagement perspective of supply networks focuses on the study of strategic alliances for a few selected actors\nwithin the same network. By following a selective approach, alliances are established only between those companies\nthat recognise each other as potential strategic partners.\nAs supply networks broaden, the issue of strategic integration arises and the need for understanding the integration\nacross organisations and functions (Harland et al., 2006: 746). Harland, Lamming, and Cousins (1999) proposed the\nconcept of \"supply strategy\" as a more holistic and multi-system level of supply. Triad-level analysis is critical,\nbecause the triad occupies an intermediate level in network analysis, which represents a valuable layer of meaning,\nsince dyads are embedded in triads (Madhavan et al. 2004).\nIn order to explore how firms manage their triadic structural positions in supply networks, we adopted\n6network theory from strategic management and applied the triad concept to supply networks. The strategic network\nperspective suggests that firms with superior network structures such as central position (Wasserman and Faust,\n1994) and structural holes (Burt, 1992), exert a significant impact on access to resource information, social capital\nbrokerage and responses to the environment, (Zaheer and Bell, 2005; Gulati, Nohria, and Zaheer, 2000). Superior\nnetwork structures have better:\n\uf096 Access to resources and information when firms with superior network structures, such as central positions, are\nable to access resources and information and better exploit them. Those firms show greater efficiency, more\neffective coordination and performance than other network partners (Zaheer and Bell, 2005; Burt, 1992). Such\nfirms develop their competitive capabilities and advantages faster and more easily, through a network of ties, than\nother actors in peripheral positions (Gynawali, He, and Madhavan, 2006).\n\uf096 Social capital of brokerage when firms have an advantage, based on their location in a social structure.\nInformation arbitrage is the major advantage of those actors who bridge the structural holes (Burt, 2004). They are\nbridging two sides to become aware of interests and difficulties, transferring best practice, drawing analogies\nbetween two sides and creating synthesis, which creates the control advantage and bargaining power to control the\nflow by \"playing them off against each other\" through the selective transfer of information and other resources\n(Gynawali et al., 2006).\n\uf096 Response to the environment when occupying a bridging position provides a vision of options otherwise unseen.\nFirms bridging structural holes have an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities (Burt,\n2004), responding faster to external threats and opportunities (Zaheer and Bell 2005), and are better able to\ndiscover potential exchange partners and allies.\nManagement mechanisms in supply networks\nSupply networks need strategic management skills to plan, coordinate and review goal achievement, such as the\nmanagement of supplier relationships and strategic thinking (Giunipero et al., 2006). Effective network management\nis a source of competitive advantage and underpins corporate performance (Bititici et al., 2004, 2005, Bales, Maull\nand Radnor, 2004). The management of inter-organisational relationships across a range of academic disciplines,\nsuch as transaction cost economics (TCE), the resource-based view (RBV) and social capital, is used to analyse,\nexplain and formalise the supply activities of individual firms (Cousins et al., 2006). We will expand on each of\n7these in turn.\nThe transaction cost economics (TCE) perspective on supply networks focuses on contract negotiation and\npartner coordination and monitoring, which are considered central elements of effective alliance management\n(Gulati and Singh, 1998). Based on TCE perspective, coordination mechanisms are important for managing\ncollaborative relationships (Danese et al., 2006), agreements and bylaws in contracts help to define partners\u2019\ncommitments (Gulati, 1995), collaborative decision-making including collective responsibilities for outcomes\n(Coughlan et al., 2003; Das and Teng, 2003; Jones et al., 1997), and conflict and resolve disputes (Vereecke and\nMuylle, 2006; Jehn and Mannix, 2001).\nThe Resource-based view (RBV) on supply networks focuses on the commitment between partners to work\ntogether and to contribute their resources for maximizing value creation (Ireland et al., 2002). Commitment and\ncoordination functions such as setting up collaborative organisations, collecting and disseminating information,\nscheduling activities and determining demand allocations are important for managing collaborative relationships\n(Vereecke and Muylle, 2006). Resource allocation (Das and Teng, 2003) and distribution are essential in distributing\nprofits and sharing responsibility among the network actors (Vereecke and Muylle, 2006; Bengtsson and Kock,\n2000).\nThe Social capital perspective on supply networks focuses on structural embeddedness, indicates that trust\nbetween social actors is necessary to gain full cooperation and for transferring resources and knowledge (Jones et al.,\n1997). Trust facilitates consensus (Bengtsson and Kock, 2000) and reduces cultural differences, misunderstanding,\nand opportunistic behaviour. In supply networks, high levels of trust, consensus building, communication and\ninteraction contribute to the concept of collaboration as synergistic, unique and creative (Coughlan et al., 2003).\nThese three different management perspectives concur that coordination and trust are key strategic management\nskills, which underpin supply network performance.\nManaging triads in supply networks\nEffective supply network cooperation, integration and management underpin successful supply network\nperformance (Coughlan et al., 2003). Vereecke and Muylle (2006) emphasie that supply network cooperation should\nbe a win\/win arrangement that increases business success for both parties. This research studies the structural\nposition that a focal company occupies in different triad structures and explores how the structural position\n8influences cooperative performance. From the theoretical perspectives analysed above, we advance two propositions\n(as summarised in Figure2).\nProposition 1: The types of triad structures affect cooperative performance.\nProposition 2: In different types of triad structures, different management mechanisms administered by the\ncompany affect cooperative performance.\n\"Take in Figure 2\"\nMethodology\nResearch setting\nNetwork boundaries have long been a critical concern for network research, as indicated by Provan and Sebastian\n(1998). The military avionics maintenance industry contains clearly defined supply networks. The prevailing\nphenomenon of triads within this industry constitutes a readily observable research setting. In Taiwan, the military\navionic maintenance industry is characterised by high entry barriers that exclude small companies. This\ncharacteristic provides an ideal setting for identifying a clear network boundary and the triads within the network. In\nTaiwan, four major domestic companies, five foreign companies and six small domestic suppliers operate in the\nmilitary avionics maintenance industry. The four major domestic companies are the Aerospace Industry\nDevelopment Corporation (AIDC), Air Asia, China Airlines, and the Evergreen Aviation Technology Corp. of these\nfour, the leading company participated in the investigation as the focal company (FC).\nThe Focal Company (FC), the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation, previously known as the Aero\nIndustry Development Center, was founded in 1969. In 1996, in order to help achieve national aerospace\ndevelopment objectives, the FC was reformed from a military establishment into a government-owned company\nunder the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Through the government support of the past 40 years, the\nFC has become well-equipped with the expertise and capability dedicated to the aviation industry in aircraft system\nintegration, aircraft development, parts manufacturing, aircraft assembly, testing, verification and maintenance.\nCurrently, it employs 3,000 people with the ability to provide aircraft and components maintenance. In recent years,\nthe market share of the FC has risen from 65% to more than 80%. Through the transition of privatisation, the FC is\n9well positioned to support and foster the various national aerospace development policies.\nResearch approach\nThe theoretical issue of managing triads in supply networks is regarded as emergent or nascent. According to\nEdmondson and McManus (2007:1161), nascent theory is that which has \u201creceived little research of formal\ntheorising to date or else that represent new phenomena in the world\u201d. In order to achieve a methodological fit (Yin,\n1999; Edmondson and McManus, 2007) between the state of previous research, research method, analysis and\nexpected contribution, we adopted an exploratory case study strategy involving 15 network actors operating in 13\ndifferent triads (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1999; Hoskisson, et al. 1999; Voss et al, 2002).\nWe covered the entire population by studying the FC and the other 14 network actors operating in the military\navionics service maintenance industry in Taiwan. The total network actors are the FC, which is the dominant\nnetwork actor, by virtue of holding more than 80% of the market share, five foreign companies, three major\ndomestic companies and six domestic suppliers and agents. This is the first time this phenomenon has been\nresearched in this context.\nWe selected the \u201ctriad-level\u201d as the unit of analysis. In the Taiwanese military avionic service maintenance\nindustry, the high entry barriers shape the entire industry, making it relatively small, which enables a clear and easy\nidentification of the supply network boundary. Coupled with the advantage of such a boundary, the case study\napproach allowed us to gather data on a small number of study objects and yielded a multifaceted view of the\nmanagement of triads in the given network. For these reasons, case studies within clearly-defined network and triad\nboundaries provided the ideal methodological combination.\nThirteen triads from a total of fifteen companies were identified. The focal company (FC) was always one of\nthe companies in each of the thirteen triads, but playing a different role. The thirteen triads were then categorised\ninto three generic types of triads, based on categorisations given in the literature.\nThirteen triads were investigated through structured questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, as well as\ndocument examination. Appendix I shows the backgrounds of our formal interviewees. The results presented in this\npaper focus on triad structures, management mechanisms and cooperative performance. Due to space limitations,\nfull descriptions of the thirteen triads are not presented here, but are available on request. The structured\nquestionnaires were designed with a combination of Likert-scale questions and open-ended questions, based on\n10\nbroader information provided in the literature. Appendix II gives an example of the type of questions applied. The\nfollowing section explains the development of the measurement items used in the structured questionnaires.\nMeasurements items used in the structured questionnaires\nThe measurement items were developed from the literature, including triad structures, management mechanisms and\ncooperative performance. We present each of these three in turn.\nTriad structure. The triad structure has been categorised theoretically into six triads (see Figure 1). In this\nstudy, we excluded the null triad (Triad 1), isolated triad (Triad 4), and dyad (Triad 2), because, from a focal\ncompany perspective, Triads 1 and 4 are defined as isolated roles and Triad 2 yields only one connection between\nthree actors and is defined as a dyad, but not as a triad. Triads 3, 5, and 6 represent our triad structures. Depending\non the structural position in which the focal company is embedded, we further identified Triads 3, 5, and 6 as three\nspecific types including:\n\uf096 Type I: Bridge role in triad, in which the focal company is connected to two disconnected partners, playing\nboth a central and bridging role between two partners in a triad (Figure 1 Triad 3).\n\uf096 Type II: Peripheral role in triad, in which the focal company is connected to one of the two connected\npartners, playing a peripheral role in a triad (Figure 1 Triad 5).\n\uf096 Type III. Fully-connected triad, in which three actors are all connected with each other (Figure 1 Triad 6).\nManagement mechanism. Several mechanisms for managing alliances and networks have been proposed. We\nhave focused on three management mechanisms:\n\uf096 Coordination mechanism is measured by the extent to which the triad is coordinated by the following five\nelements: (1) formal agreements and bylaws; (2) integrated decision-making; (3) resource allocation; (4)\nbenefit distribution; and (5) conflict management (Vereecke and Muylle, 2006; Danese et al., 2006;\nCoughlan et al., 2003; Das and Teng, 2003; Jehn and Mannix, 2001; Bengtsson and Kock, 2000; Gulati\nand Singh, 1998; Jones et al., 1997; Gulati, 1995).\n\uf096 Trust mechanism is measured by the following two elements: (1) trust between focal actor and the other\nactors; and (2) trust between two other actors in a triad (Coughlan et al., 2003; Bengtsson and Kock,\n11\n2000; Jones et al., 1997).\n\uf096 Market mechanism is measured by the following two elements: (1) the extent to which the contract is\ndetermined by the price set by public biding (i.e., price mechanism); and (2) the potential partners in the\nmarket (Ouchi and Bolton, 1988).\nCooperative Performance. Cooperative performance is measured either objectively or subjectively. Rond and\nBouchikhi (2004) suggest that performance cannot be considered as an objective attribute of an alliance, since\ndifferent actors can legitimately hold diverse views on performance and how it ought to be measured. For the\npurpose of this research, subjective measurements are used, not just because information on financial performance is\nunavailable, but also because performance assessment in a triad is intrinsically difficult. Due to these limitations, we\nuse perceptual data to substitute for financial data. Danese et al. (2006) analysed the sequences of improvement in\nsupply networks and indicated some useful performance measurements, such as supply network efficiency, supply\nnetwork flexibility, and stock-out risk in supply networks. Based on these perspectives and industrial practices, we\nmeasure cooperative performance from the focal company perspective.\nPerceived cooperative performance is measured by the following items (Zollo et al., 2002):\n(1) Satisfaction with goal attainment;\n(2) Potential new business opportunities;\n(3) Satisfaction with the cooperative relationship;\n(4) Willingness for continuous cooperation.\nThe measurement items of management mechanisms and cooperative performance were designed on\n5-point-scale likert type of questions as shown in Appendix II.\nResearch Process\nThere were four steps in this research. i) identifying network actors, ii) identifying network connections, iii) defining\nunits of analysis and samples, and iv) collecting perceptual data pertaining to management mechanisms and\ncooperative performance. These are expanded on turn.\n\uf096 Identifying network actors. Firstly, in order to identify the network boundary, we asked the respondents to\n12\nindicate the important actors who are already positioned in the Taiwanese market. Re-confirming with all the\nrespondents, fifteen companies, including four major avionics-related domestic companies, six other domestic\ncompanies, and five foreign companies were identified. The backgrounds of the network actors are given in\nTable I.\n\"Take in Table I\"\n\uf096 Identifying network connections. Secondly, we asked the respondents to identify all the connections between\nactors in the network. The connection between any two actors is identified by three circumstances: (1)\nlong-term and frequent transactional relationship between two companies; (2) two companies have been\nworking together for a long time to complete some project; (3) long-term supply-customer relationship\nbetween two companies. As indicated in Table I, the long-term relationship between the focal company and its\npartners in this network has lasted between 12 and 30 years. Figure 3 shows the supply network and\nparticipation of the focal company in the thirteen triads.\n\"Take in Figure 3\"\n\uf096 Unit of analysis and samples. In this study, the sample is defined as a triad comprising a focal actor and its\nlinkages to the other two actors in a network. In this third step, when all the connections between any two\nactors in the network had been identified, we asked the respondents to indicate the triad that was formed by the\nfocal company (FC) and its connections with the other two actors. In order to ensure the validity of each triad\nsample, we cross-checked with all the respondents, until they confirmed that each triad had its structural\noperation in place. Finally, thirteen triads were identified in this network, which constitute the research samples\nfor the study. According to the triad structures, these thirteen triad samples were categorised further into the\nthree types of triad structure identified from the literature; i.e. Types I, II and III. Table II shows the thirteen\ntriad samples (categorised by three types of triad structure in the network), the specific task of each triad and\nthe correspondent FC department involved within each triad. Five triads were identified as Type I- bridge role\nin triad, (shown as pink lines in Figure 3), four triads were identified as Type II- peripheral role in triad (blue\nlines in Figure 3), and four triads were identified as Type III- fully-connected triad (black lines in Figure 3).\n\"Take in Table II\"\n\uf096Collecting perceptual data and analysis. Finally, we collected data on management mechanisms and\n13\nperformance. We conducted the individual face-to-face interviews in order to establish how each triadic\nrelationship was represented in practice. In addition, the structured questionnaire yields insights into the extent\nto which the focal company perceives and uses the management mechanisms and the effect on cooperative\nperformance. We asked respondents from the focal company to reflect on each triad while answering the\nquestionnaire. For each triad sample, the respondents were asked to circle a number from 1-5 on the\nquestionnaire, to indicate the extent of perceived management mechanisms and cooperative performance. To\nminimise respondent bias, we triangulated the interview data and cross-checked the answers. This indicated\nconsistency between respondents. We also supported the responses with the use of archival records and\ndocumentation. Based on the interview responses and the documentation, we are able to identify the\ndifferences in management mechanisms adopted by each triad and the cooperative performance generated.\nData collection\nIn total, 16 interviewees provided the data for the research, five from the focal company and eleven from the other\ncompanies in the network. 68 interview transcription pages resulted from 150 hours of face-to-face interviews and\ntelephone interviews. In addition, informal interviews, those with other network employees and in-situ document\nanalysis formed part of the research. The interviewees were well placed informants, including one deputy general\nmanager, two CEOs, two vice CEOs, one chairman of the board, and ten directors. Most have had at least 10 to 20\nyears of practical experience in their areas of expertise. Appendix 1 shows the backgrounds of the interviewees.\nData Analysis\nData from the structured questionnaires was analysed in two ways. First, the structured questionnaire responses were\ncaptured and analysed within a database. We synthesised the management mechanisms and cooperative performance\nresults from each individual case. These individual results were then analysed, compared and contrasted in relation\nto their position and relationship within the respective triads. The synthesis of this analysis is presented in Table III.\nThe interpretation of the data was performed by focusing on the highest scores and then comparing them with the\nlowest scores. Second, the content of the open-ended questions was analysed. The data was then triangulated with\nthe structured questionnaire responses. The structured questionnaire responses from the Likert -scale questions were\ncoupled with qualitative quotations from interviewees, a process referred to as data confirmation or confirmatory\nanalysis. Finally, data from archival records and documentation was triangulated with the interviewee analysis\n14\n(explained above); a so-called triangulation of multiple sources of information. By using different respondents,\ndifferent sources of information and, to a certain extent, a variety of methods, we increased the internal validity and\nreliability of the research.\nResults\nThe purpose of this study is to answer the following questions: (1) in a supply network, how do different triad\nstructures affect cooperative performance? And (2) from the perspective of the focal company, how do the\nmanagement mechanisms affect cooperative performance?\nThe association between types of triad structure and performance, and the relationship between management\nmechanisms and cooperative performance were analysed and synthesised from the interview data, questionnaires\nand documentation. We summarised the perceptual data on management mechanisms and cooperative performance\nfor each triad. Table III shows the degree of perceived impact of the market mechanism, coordination mechanism,\ntrust mechanism and cooperative performance of the thirteen samples categorised according to three generic types of\ntriad structures, demonstrating that:\n\uf096 Triad Type I: where the focal actor plays the bridge role in a triad, four of five triads [Samples I-1, I-2, I-3, and\nI-5] perceived high levels of trust (scoring 5.0: highest level) and high levels of cooperative performance\n(scoring 5.0, 4.5, 4.5 and 4.0).\n\uf096 Triad Type II: where the focal actor plays the peripheral role in a triad, two of four triads [Samples II-3 and II-4]\nperceived high levels of coordination (scoring 4.2 and 5.0), high levels of trust (Scoring 4.0 and 5.0) and high\nlevels of cooperative performance (scoring 4.0 and 5.0).\n\uf096 Triad Type III: fully-connected triad. Two of four triads [Samples III-3 and III-4] perceived moderate levels of\ntrust (scoring 4.0), high levels of coordination (scoring 4.6) and high levels of cooperative performance (scoring\n4.4 and 5.0). However, they perceived a low level of market mechanism such as, pricing and partner selection\n(by scoring 2.0).\nThese findings show that the focal company, when occupying different structural positions in a triad, may\nadopt different mechanisms for managing the triad. Eight of the thirteen triads reveal perceived high cooperative\nperformance; two triads are moderate and three triads yield a low level of perceived cooperative performance. From\n15\nthose eight high-performance triads, four have a Triad Type I configuration, two have a Triad Type II structure, and\ntwo triads are of Type III. They demonstrate that the structural position of the focal company within a triad,\ninfluence triad performance. More detailed discussions and implications are addressed in the following section.\n\"Take in Table III\"\nDiscussion and findings\nThe first research question was to investigate how different triad structures affect perceived cooperative performance.\nAs shown in Table III, of the three types of triads, Type I (bridge role in triad) reveals higher perceived cooperative\nperformance than Type II (peripheral role in triad) and Type III (fully-connected triad).\nIt could be argued that, while occupying a bridge and central position in a triad, the focal firm perceived\nhigher cooperative performance, in terms of satisfaction with goal attainment and cooperative relationships,\npossibility with respect to new business opportunities, and willingness to engage in continuous cooperation.\nConversely, while occupying a peripheral position in a triad or being in a fully-connected triad, the focal firm has\nlow cooperative performance. An interviewee commented:\n\"Being in a central position of the triad, we were the first to know when there was a business opportunity,\nonce we won the contact, we acquired a dominant position, which enabled us to select better supply partners, and\nto design and control the maintenance operation process for the whole business. Therefore, we are more satisfied\nwith the level of goal attainment and the nature of our cooperative relationships.\"\nOccupying a central position in a triad, the focal company has the advantage of accessing unique information\nand having the power to control the relationship. Thus the focal company perceived higher company performance.\nThis result is consistent with the network perspective, which asserts that firms occupying the favoured network\nposition of bridging role are likely to perform better, because of better information access and control advantages\n(Burt, 2004, 1992; Madhavan et al., 2004; Gulati et al., 2000;). Based on this analysis, our research reveals the\nfollowing:\nFinding 1: In a triad, a firm playing a bridging role perceives higher cooperative performance than playing a\nperipheral role in the triad or those located in a fully-connected triad.\n16\nWe then examined the second research question. That is, what are the management mechanisms that the focal\ncompany adopted to manage different triads in order to generate better performance? First, in a triad where the focal\ncompany played a central bridging role, the relationship between the trust mechanism and perceived cooperative\nperformance was quite clear. However, the relationship between the market mechanism and cooperative\nperformance was not established at all, nor was a relationship between the coordination mechanism and cooperative\nperformance. Four of the five triads in Type I, which experienced high trust, consistently reveal high cooperative\nperformance. However, one exceptional triad of Type I (sample I-4), with a moderate level of trust, showed\nmoderate cooperative performance. In triad I-4, an interviewee stated that:\n\"Because we are in the central position, keeping a long-term relationship cannot just rely on coordination and\nthe market mechanism. Trust is the most important factor for a long-term collaborative relationship. However in\nthis case, both companies RG and B are our agents. We don't want to maintain closer relationships with those\nagents; instead, our cooperation with them is only based on \u2018market benefits\u2019 and there is not much trust between us.\nTherefore, we do not expect an ongoing cooperative relationship with them.\"\nThese findings indicate that, when a focal company occupies a central and bridging position, more trust is\nneeded to manage this triad, so as to generate higher cooperative performance. Coleman (1988) adds that actors in a\ndense network are able to rely on norms and sanctions against opportunism. Zaheer and Venkatraman (1995) also\nsuggest that consistent trust facilitates greater relation-specific investments, and reduces monitoring costs. The\nstudy indicates that:\nFinding 2: When a firm plays the bridging role in triad, high level of trust and the associated mechanisms, lead to\nhigher perceived cooperative performance.\nIn the triad where the focal company occupies a peripheral position, we found that simultaneously a higher\nlevel of coordination mechanism and higher level of trust mechanism leads to higher level of perceived cooperative\nperformance. Two of the four triads in Type II have high levels of coordination and trust mechanisms and\nconsistently yield a high level of perceived cooperation. By contrast, the other two triads with both low levels of\ncoordination and trust mechanisms showed low and moderate perceived cooperative performance. However, no\n17\nassociation between market mechanism and cooperative performance was found in any type of triad. For example,\nin triad II-3, Collins is in the central position, the focal company (FC) and LMTAS are located in peripheral\npositions. Both Collins and LMTAS are large global companies and major players in aircraft manufacturing and\nsystems integration. A manager from the focal company commented:\n\"Although we are in a peripheral position without dominant power, we could still retain the benefits of\ncollaboration, because of the coordination actions associated with the agreements and bylaws in the contract.\nBesides, we both trust each other, because we share a common vision of working together to acquire more business\nopportunities, particularly in the military market. We are satisfied with the cooperative relationships. Without a\ntrustworthy prelateship, we could only obtain what was written in the contract, but with high levels of trust, we also\ngot extra business and benefits.\"\nThe findings suggest that, when occupying a peripheral position without the advantages of unique information\naccess and control, firms use highly developed coordination mechanisms, such as formal contracts, since agreements\nand bylaws written in contracts help to define partners\u2019 commitments (Gulati, 1995). Trust is needed as well,\nbecause it facilitates consensus (Bengtsson and Kock, 2000) and diminishes misunderstanding and opportunistic\nbehaviour (Gulati, 1998). Common behavioural norms improve mutual understanding and lower the possibility of\nmisinterpretation of a firm's actions by its partners (Ahuja, 2000a; Gulati, 1995). In supply networks, high levels of\ntrust lead to synergistic and creative collaboration (Coughlan et al., 2003). Particularly when the focal actor is not in\nthe central position, trust can constitute a supplementary mechanism, when coordination is more difficult, due to a\nfirm occupying a peripheral position, rather than a central one. The study indicates that:\nFinding 3: When a firm plays a peripheral role in triad, high levels of coordination mechanism combined with high\nlevels of trust, result in higher levels of perceived cooperative performance.\nIn Type III fully-connected triads, two triads with low levels of market mechanism, but high levels of\ncoordination mechanism and high levels of trust mechanism represented higher perceived cooperative performance.\nConversely, the other two triads with high levels of market mechanism, but low levels of coordination mechanism\nand low levels of trust mechanism represented lower perceived cooperative performance. This result implies that,\n18\nwhen located in a fully connected triad, the coordination and trust mechanisms are positively associated with\ncooperative performance, but of the market mechanism is negatively associated with the level of cooperation.\nBecause, in a fully connected triad, information flows equally between the three actors, no one plays a brokerage\nrole, enabling it to take advantage of information arbitrage, as discussed by Burt (2004). Market mechanisms, such\nas the price mechanism and methods for selecting potential partners, are not useful for managing the triad. A\nmanager explained:\n\"We all have connections with the other two actors, \u2018market information\u2019 is open to everyone, there is no\ninformation asymmetry between us. If we rely too much on market mechanisms, such as pricing, we can benefit only\nby reducing the price of the bid. This is, however, not only useless for keeping a balanced relationship among three\nof us, but also may reduce the trust that we have established.\"\nAhuja (2000a) argues that collaborative relationships benefit more from trust engendered by dense networks,\nthan from information diversity garnered through a central position. In a fully-connected triad, trust reduces the\nlikelihood of mutual competitive practices (Zaheer and Bell, 2005). Coordination mechanisms, including formal\ncontracts, integrated decision-making, resource allocation, benefit distribution and conflict management, ensure a\nclear definition of partner commitments (Gulati, 1995), so as to achieve strategic consistency (Das and Teng, 2003)\nand to resolve disputes and conflicts (Jehn and Mannix, 2001). According to these findings and theoretical\nperspectives, it can be argued that:\nFinding 4: In a fully-connected triad, when the coordination mechanism is well developed, the level of trust is high,\nbut the level of market mechanism is low, so that the resulting level of perceived cooperation is high.\nIn general, our findings reflect the propositions derived from the theory that: (1) The types of triad structures\naffect cooperative performance; and (2) In different types of triad structures, different management mechanisms\nadministered by the focal company affect cooperative performance. In this study, we found that, while playing a\nbridging role in triad, the focal company perceives higher cooperative performance than playing a peripheral role in\na triad or when located in a fully-connected triad. This finding confirms the proposition that types of triad structures\naffect cooperative performance. In addition, we found that while playing the bridging role in a triad, the more\n19\neffective the trust mechanism, the greater the cooperative performance. While playing the peripheral role in a triad,\nan effective coordination mechanism, combined with an effective trust mechanism, result in greater cooperative\nperformance. In the case of a fully-connected triad, a more effective coordination mechanism and more effective\ntrust mechanism and lower market mechanism, result in greater cooperative performance. These findings support the\nproposition that the management mechanisms implemented by the focal company to manage the different triads,\nresult in different levels of perceived cooperative performance.\nIn this study, we examined the relationship between triadic structure and management mechanisms from the\nfocal company perspective. An issue arising from the research could be why it may be appropriate to focus on the\nfocal company\u2019s perspective, and not on those of all actors. We established that actors demonstrate different\nbehaviour when occupying different structural positions in a triad. The structural positions of all actors take the\nform of relative roles (central role relative to peripheral role). That is, the three actors must hold different positions,\nwhich lead to different styles of management and subsequent performance. Therefore, the intention of this study is\nnot to determine the level of consistency among the three actors in the triad, but rather the influence of structural\nroles on management mechanisms and performance.\nPractical implications\nSince supply networks and strategic alliances involve implicit and open-ended contracts, social mechanisms are\ncritical to effectively functioning networks. It is important to understand how social mechanisms reinforce,\nsubstitute, or undermine one another and how their specific combination influences performance (Jones et al., 1997).\nIn this study, having examined different triad structures and the management mechanisms adopted by the focal\ncompany, we believe that the implications for managerial practice, based on our results from thirteen triads in a\nsupply network, are as follows:\n\uf096 The more central the position in a triad structure, the greater the level of perceived cooperative performance.\nThis implies that, when participating in a supply network, firms should first realise their structural positions,\nand only then try to secure a position at the centre, so as to create a bridging role in the triad. Playing a\nbridging role increases bargaining power and enables a rapid response to environment change. Therefore,\nthey perceived higher levels of cooperative performance.\n\uf096 A bridging position in a triad requires more trust mechanisms to yield higher perceived cooperative\n20\nperformance. This implies that, in the central position, firms already possess information and control\nadvantages, so that, trust becomes more important, since it reduces monitoring costs and opportunism and\nincreases the willingness to engage in ongoing cooperation.\n\uf096 A peripheral role in a triad requires the combination of coordination and trust mechanisms. Due to the\ncomparative lack of advantages, coordination mechanism enables firms to protect their benefits.\n\uf096 In a fully connected triad, information and knowledge flows relatively freely between the actors, and no one\ntakes advantage of information arbitrage and power. Therefore, trust and coordination are needed, as in\ncentral or in peripheral positions. Conversely, however, the market mechanism is not only unnecessary; it\nmay even reduce trust, which in turn, leads to less satisfaction and unwillingness to undertake subsequent\ncooperation.\nConclusions\nSupply management can be viewed as both an emerging academic domain and an emerging field of practice (Storey\net al., 2006). In practice, the military avionics maintenance industry is high-tech, high value-added and characterised\nby high barriers to entry. As a result of dramatic environmental changes, the companies in this industry have moved\ntheir strategic attention from internal operations management towards managing supply networks and strategic\nalliances.\nIn the academic domain, according to Pilkinton and Fitzgerald (2006), the IJOPM publications have shown a\ngreater integration of key concept, a more subtle appreciation of context, and a more rounded evaluation of specific\npractices. Giunipero et al. (2006) draw attention to five major supply management trends, including strategic\nrelationships, cost reduction, integrated systems and collaboration, total cost of ownership, and strategic orientation,\nindicating the importance of strategic supply network and managing inter-organisational collaborative relationships.\nFrom the strategic management perspective, triad structure represents a valuable layer of analysis in network\nresearch (Madhavan et al., 2004). However, the lack of empirical evidence on managing triads in networks reveals a\ndegree of under-investigation of triad microstructures. This study contributes to the existing strategy research on\nmanaging triads in networks. From the operations management perspective, the study contributes to linking the\nstrategic management and social network perspective, by exploring a practical phenomenon in a specific context\nthat is highly related to the operation and production management field.\n21\nBy examining thirteen triads of the total supply network in the Taiwanese military avionic service\nmaintenance industry, the results support our two propositions.\nThe propositions and findings derived from this study could be also applied to other collaborative enterprise\nmodels. Bititci et al. (2004) have identified different levels of collaboration and categorised existing collaborative\nenterprise models into supply chains, extended and virtual enterprises, and clusters. Each category of collaborative\nenterprise model is composed of dyadic and triadic structures, so that managing dyadic and triadic relationships in\nthe case of each collaborative enterprise model is a significant issue in the era of supply networks and strategic\nalliances. Because each collaborative enterprise model entails different value propositions and entails various\nresources and capabilities, describing a different level or format of strategic collaboration, the nature of triad\nstructures and management mechanisms may vary with the type of cooperative networks, such as value chains,\nextended enterprise, virtual enterprise, and clusters. Moreover, exactly how triad structures and management\nmechanisms influence the cooperative performance may demonstrate different consequences of both intrinsic and\nextrinsic inter-enterprise performance measures in each collaborative enterprise model, as proposed by Bititci, et al.\n(2005).\nThis study supports and extends the existing knowledge in the field of managing inter-organisational\ncollaboration. In particular, it emphasises that trust is a key aspect of any collaborative relationship and that\ncoordination between partners is a key factor in determining the performance of the network.\nLimitations and future research\nThe key limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are:\n\uf096 Although the focal company in this study is a leading and dominant one in the Taiwanese avionics\nmaintenance market, a single approach from only a focal company would seem to constitute a major\nlimitation. Because we examine the inter-organisational relationships in the supply network particularly\nat the triadic level, the diversification and broad product\/service scope of the focal company enables us\nto identify 13 triad samples. However, collecting data from a single focal company within a unique\nindustry confirmed the robustness of the methodology. Future researchers may, therefore, safely adopt\nthe methodology used in this present study to examine the phenomenon in other companies and\nindustrial contexts.\n22\n\uf096 A sample of thirteen triads in a highly specialised network context could be perceived as a limiting factor\nfor statistical generalisability. However, our exploratory findings surely remain worthy of note and can\nbe tested empirically in future research. We suggest that subsequent research could examine the\nhypotheses in larger sample size or take the same approach in a specific context.\n\uf096 In this study, we measured cooperative performance from the focal company's point of view, because we\nexamined triad structures from the focal company perspective as well. However, we did not examine the\nmanagement mechanisms used by the other two actors, nor the performance of the triad as a whole.\nNeely (2005) states that the nature of performance measurement across networks, rather than within\norganizations, is a major issue for those researchers in the field. Future research could explore how the\ncompany's structural positions of the three parties influence performance across triad partners and the\nperformance of triad as a whole. In addition, due to the limitation that objective performance data is\nunavailable, we measured only perceived cooperative performance. Therefore, future research could\nusefully incorporate not only perceived cooperative performance, but also other dimensions of\nperformance.\n\uf096 While our study focused on the triad structure and the associated management mechanism, future research\ncould examine other factors influencing management mechanisms and cooperative performance. For\nexample, resource asymmetries and resource exchanges among three actors in a triad may lead to\ndifferences in competitive and cooperative behaviour among them (Gynawali et al., 2006). This, in turn,\nresults in different management mechanisms and levels of performance. Future research could examine\nsimultaneous competition and cooperation in a triad and how this influences cooperative performance.\nDespite these limitations, this research contributes to the field in three ways. Firstly, it provides an empirical\nstudy of triads, which is important for an emerging field. Secondly, the respondents were all well-informed chief\nexecutives and directors; we are indebted to them for the level of access provided. Thirdly, within a very specific\ncontext, we managed to cover the entire population.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, this research adopted a strategic management and social network perspective,\nin order to examine the phenomenon in a specific industrial context that is closely related to the operations and\nproduction management field. We also propose relevant findings for future research on how structural position\naffects management mechanisms and cooperative performance. In particular, we selected the unit of analysis as the\n23\ntriad level, which is an important research layer, but one that has been accorded less attention than the other four\nsupply network layers from Harland\u2019s model (1996). From a practical perspective, according to our results from\nthirteen triads, the more central the bridging position in a triad structure, the better the cooperative performance.\nThis implies that firms should move their locations from peripheral positions toward central ones, thus creating a\nbridging role in a triad. Our findings also yield implications for practitioners on how to adopt management\nmechanisms in order to manage different structural positions in triads.\n24\nREFERENCES\nAhuja, G.

Questionnaire for management mechanisms and cooperative performance\nManagement mechanism is a set of process and means used for managing the cooperative activities in order to\nattain collective goals. It is measured by the extent to which the respondents perceive the following items on a\n5-point scale. (1: the least agreed; 5: the most agreed)\n(1) The triad is well-coordinated by the formal agreements and bylaws mechanism\n(2) The triad is well-coordinated by an integrated decision-making mechanism\n(3) The triad is well-coordinated by a resource integration and allocation mechanism\n(4) The triad is well-coordinated by a benefit distribution mechanism\n(5) The triad is well-coordinated by a conflict management and resolution mechanism\n(6) The triad is well-managed by trustworthy between focal actor and the other actors\n(7) The triad is well-managed by trustworthy between two other actors in a triad\n(8) In this triad, any contract between actors is highly determined by the price of public\nbid\n(9) In this triad, any contract between actors can be easily substituted by many potential\npartners in the market\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\nCooperative Performance.
