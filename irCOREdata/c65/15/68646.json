In all these phenomena it would be advantageous to\ncontrol the escape probability by applying an external\nforce. The problem of escape of driven systems has there-\nfore attracted much attention in diverse contexts, a recent\napplication being stochastic resonance.1 We show that\nthis problem can be solved in a very general form for a\nbroad range of driving field frequencies, which goes far\nbeyond the adiabatic limit. The analytic theory is com-\npared with the results of analog and digital simulations.\nWe then discuss experiments on controlling escape in\nmodulated optical traps. An important application of the\nresults is the possibility of selective control of particle\ndiffusion in a periodic potential, including both the rate\nand direction of the diffusion.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe question of how a system responds to an external\nfield is one of the fundamental problems of physics. A strong\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Electronic mail:\ndykman@pa.msu.edu5871054-1500\/2001\/11(3)\/587\/8\/$18.00\nDownloaded 05 Sep 2001 to 35.8.48.84. Redistribution subject to Anonlinear response is usually associated with a sharply reso-\nnant excitation of the system. However, the effect of external\ndriving may also be extremely large for an important and\nwide class of phenomena related to large fluctuations, includ-\ning escape from a metastable state and nucleation in phase\ntransitions.\nThe mechanism responsible is readily understood for\nadiabatically slow driving, where the driving frequency is\nsmall compared to the relaxation rate in the absence of fluc-\ntuations and the system remains in quasiequilibrium. For sys-\ntems in thermal equilibrium, the fluctuation probabilities are\ngiven by the activation law, W}exp(2R\/kBT). For large in-\nfrequent fluctuations, which are discussed in the present pa-\nper, the probabilities W are much less than all frequencies\nand relaxation rates. We will be specifically interested in ac-\ntivated escape, in which case R is the activation energy of\nescape. The driving force modulates the value of R quasi-\nstatically and, even where the modulation amplitude udRu is\nsmall compared to R , it may still substantially exceed kBT ,\nin which case W will be changed very strongly. We empha-\nsize that the change of the activation energy is linear in the\nfield amplitude, for udRu!R .\nFor higher field frequencies, where the driving becomes\nnonadiabatic, the expected major effect of the field would be\nto \u2018\u2018heat up\u2019\u2019 the system by changing its effective tempera-\nture. Indeed, in the weak-field limit, the escape rate W is\u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics\nIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/ojps.aip.org\/chaos\/chocr.jsp\n588 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Dykman et al.known, theoretically2 and experimentally,3 to be incremented\nby a term proportional to the field intensity I rather than the\namplitude A}I1\/2.2 However, one may ask what happens if\nthe appropriately weighted field amplitude is not small com-\npared to the fluctuation intensity ~temperature!, and whether\nan exponentially strong change of the escape rate will occur.\nTheoretical analysis of nonadiabatically driven systems\nis complicated, since one may no longer assume that the\nsystem is in thermal equilibrium. Whereas for equilibrium\nsystems the exponent in the escape rate can be found, at least\nin principle, as the height of the free-energy barrier, for non-\nequilibrium systems there are no universal relations from\nwhich it can be obtained;4 the situation with the prefactor is\neven more complicated.5 Much effort has been put into solv-\ning the nonadiabatic response problem, in diverse contexts,\nand numerical results have been obtained for specific models\n~see, e.g., Refs. 6 and 7!.\nRecent theoretical results8,9 show that, counter-\nintuitively, for high-frequency driving the change of R is\nproportional to the field amplitude, i.e., ln W is linear in A ,\nover a broad range of A . The proportionality coefficient was\ncalled the logarithmic susceptibility ~LS!. Just like the con-\nventional linear susceptibility, the LS relates the response of\nthe system in the presence of external driving to its dynamics\nin thermal equilibrium in the absence of the driving field. We\nemphasize that the amplitude is a nonanalytic characteristic\nof the field, as it is obtained by taking the square root of the\nperiod-averaged squared field. We are therefore talking about\na nonanalytic field dependence of the escape rate, and we\nneed to determine a mechanism that would lead to such a\ndependence.\nIn Sec. II we provide a general formulation which allows\none to find, for a periodically driven system, the activation\nenergy of escape induced by Gaussian noise with an arbitrary\npower spectrum. In Sec. III we outline the theory and ana-\nlyze the frequency dispersion of the LS. We then discuss the\nresults on the prefactor in the escape rate of a driven\nsystem10 and analyze the full time-dependent as well as the\ntime-averaged escape rate, including both the exponent and\nprefactor. In Sec. IV we present the results of analog and\ndigital simulations of driven systems. These results provide a\nfull qualitative and quantitative confirmation of the theory,\nand also reveal the underlying physics explicitly. In Sec. V\nwe describe the experimental observations of the activated\nescape of particles in modulated optical traps. Section VI\ncontains conclusions and a discussion of unsolved problems\nin activated escape, including the problem of statistical re-\nconstruction of the dynamical model of a fluctuating system.\nII. GENERAL FORMULATION OF THE ESCAPE\nPROBLEM\nThe idea underlying the theory of the LS8,9 is that, al-\nthough the motion of the fluctuating system is random, in a\nlarge rare fluctuation from a metastable state to a remote\nstate, or in a fluctuation resulting in escape, the system is\nmost likely to move along a particular trajectory known as\nthe optimal path ~see Refs. 11\u201319 and references therein!.\nThe effect of the driving field accumulates as the systemDownloaded 05 Sep 2001 to 35.8.48.84. Redistribution subject to Amoves along the corresponding optimal path, giving rise to a\nlinear-in-the-field correction to the activation energy of es-\ncape.\nA natural theoretical approach to the escape problem is\nbased on the path-integral technique. We will give a formu-\nlation which is based on this technique and allows one to find\nthe logarithm of the escape rate for a periodically driven\nsystem. We consider a general case where fluctuations in the\nsystem are caused by a stationary colored Gaussian noise\nf (t) with a power spectrum F(v) of arbitrary shape.18,20\nThe Langevin equation of motion is of the form\nq\u02d95K~q;t !1 f ~ t !, K~q;t1tF!5K~q;t !, ~1!\nwhere tF is the period of the driving field. The noise is fully\ncharacterized by its correlation function f(t)5^ f (t) f (0)& or\nby F(v), the Fourier transform of f(t). The characteristic\nnoise intensity is D5max F(v)\/2.\nIf the noise is weak then, over the noise correlation time\ntcorr and the characteristic relaxation time in the absence of\nnoise t rel , the system will approach the metastable periodic\nstate qa(t) and will then perform small fluctuations about\nit.21 To escape from the basin of attraction of this state, the\nsystem should be subjected to a sufficiently large pulse of the\nforce f (t). Various realizations of f (t) ~the pulse shapes! can\nresult in escape. Their probability densities are given by the\nfunctional22\nP@ f ~ t !#5expF2 12D E E dt dt8 f ~ t !F\u02c6 ~ t2t8! f ~ t8!G , ~2!\nwhere F\u02c6 (t) is a reciprocal of the noise correlation function\nf(t), *dt1 F\u02c6 (t2t1)f(t12t8)5Dd(t2t8). For white noise,\nF\u02c6 (t)5f(t)\/4D5d(t)\/2.\nWe assume that the noise intensity D contains a small\nconstant, which is the small parameter of the theory. This\nparameter guarantees that the functional ~2! is exponentially\nsmall for all pulses f (t) which can give rise to escape. In\naddition, its values differ exponentially for different appro-\npriate f (t). Thus there exists a realization f (t)5 f opt(t)\nwhich is exponentially more probable than the others. This\noptimal realization provides the maximum to P subject to the\nconstraint that the system ~1! actually escapes. The path\nqopt(t) along which the system moves when driven by the\noptimal force f opt(t) is the optimal fluctuational path, qopt(t).\nFrom ~2!, the paths qopt , f opt provide the minimum to\nthe functional\nR@q~ t !, f ~ t !#5 12 E E2\u2018\n\u2018\ndt dt8 f ~ t !F\u02c6 ~ t2t8! f ~ t8!\n1E\n2\u2018\n\u2018\ndt l~ t !@ q\u02d92K~q;t !2 f ~ t !# . ~3!\nThey can be obtained from the corresponding variational\nequations of motion. The Lagrange multiplier l(t) relates\nf opt(t) and qopt(t) to each other.\nThe boundary conditions for the escape problem follow\nfrom the fact that the system starts from the periodic attractor\nqa(t)5qa(t1tF) in the distant past ~on the time scale\ntcorr , t rel!, with f 50 asymptotically, and that, as the forceIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/ojps.aip.org\/chaos\/chocr.jsp\n589Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Activated escape of systemsdecays after having driven the system away from the attrac-\ntor, the system should not be brought back to the initially\noccupied basin of attraction. The latter condition is only\nsatisfied18 if, for t\u2192\u2018 , the system is approaching the un-\nstable periodic state qb(t)5qb(t1tF) on the boundary of\nthe basin of attraction to qa(t),\nf ~ t !\u21920, l~ t !\u21920 for t\u21926\u2018 ,\n~4!\nq~ t !\u2192qa~ t ! for t\u21922\u2018 , q~ t !\u2192qb~ t ! for t\u2192\u2018 .\nThe time-averaged escape rate has the form\nW\u00af 5C exp@2R\/D# , R5min R. ~5!\nThe exponent R can be obtained for an arbitrary noise spec-\ntrum and an arbitrary periodic driving by solving the varia-\ntional problem ~3! and ~4! numerically. In particular, in the\ncase of white noise, where F\u02c6 (t)5d(t)\/2, the Lagrange mul-\ntiplier and the force f (t) can be easily eliminated from the\nvariational equations, 2l(t)5 f (t)5 q\u02d92K , and the varia-\ntional functional R for the escape problem takes the form\n~cf.

In the case of a white-noise driven\nsystem this was pointed out by Graham and Te\u00b4l.14 Generi-\ncally there are several solutions which start from the attractor\nfor t\u21922\u2018 and arrive to a given state q f at a given time t f .\nThe physically meaningful observable solution qopt(t) pro-\nvides the absolute minimum to the functional R.23\nThe prefactor C in the escape rate ~5! and the relation of\nW to a directly observable quantity, the time-periodic current\nfrom the basin of attraction, are discussed below.\nIII. THE LOGARITHMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY\nWe now turn to the case where the driving force F(t) is\nadditive,\nK~q;t !52U8~q !1F~ t !, F~ t1tF!5F~ t !, ~7!\nand only weakly perturbs the system dynamics; in particular,\nit does not change the number of attractors or saddle states.\nEven in this case the effect of F(t) on the escape probability\nmay be exponentially strong,8\u201310 because it is determined by\nthe ratio of the field-induced increment dR of the escape\nactivation energy to small noise intensity D . We note that\nU(q) can be thought of as a metastable potential in which\nthe system moves in the absence of periodic driving.\nTo first order in F , the correction dR can be obtained\nfrom the variational functional ~3! by evaluating the term\n}F(t) along the zeroth-order path qopt(0)(t), f opt(0)(t), l (0)(t).\nHowever, special care has to be taken of the fact that the\noptimal escape path is an instanton.9 In particular, the func-\ntion l (0)(t) is other than zero within a time interval of width\n;tcorr , t rel and is exponentially small otherwise. At the same\ntime, the optimal fluctuation leading to escape may occur atDownloaded 05 Sep 2001 to 35.8.48.84.

The field-\ninduced change of R should be evaluated along such a tra-\njectory, i.e.,\ndR5min\ntc\ndR~ tc!,\ndR~ tc!5E\n2\u2018\n\u2018\ndt x~ t2tc!F~ t !\n[(\nn\nx\u02dc~nvF!Fn exp~ invFtc!, ~8!\nx~ t !52l (0)~ t !,\nwhere x\u02dc(v)5*2\u2018\u2018 dt x(t)exp(ivt), and Fn is the nth Fourier\ncomponent of the field.20 A complete derivation for a white-\nnoise driven system is discussed in Ref. 9; for the general\ncase discussed here it will be given elsewhere. We note that\nEq. ~8! has a particularly simple form for sinusoidal driving,\nwhere F(t)5AcosvFt. In this case dR52ux\u02dc (vF)uA .\nThe change of the activation energy dR , and therefore\nthe logarithm of the escape rate W\u00af , are linear in the field\nF(t). The coefficient x\u02dc(v) is the logarithmic susceptibility\n~LS!.8,9 The function x is a characteristic of the system, as\nare, for example, the polarizability and other standard linear\nsusceptibilities. It can be calculated for a given model or\nmeasured experimentally.\nUnlike the standard linear susceptibility which, by cau-\nsality arguments, is given by a Fourier integral over time\nfrom 0 to \u2018, x\u02dc(v) is given by an integral from 2\u2018 to \u2018. The\nanalytic properties of x\u02dc(v) therefore differ from those of the\nstandard susceptibility and, in particular, their high-\nfrequency asymptotics are qualitatively different. The stan-\ndard susceptibility for a damped dynamical system decays as\na power law for large v @e.g., as 1\/@U9(qa)2iv# , for the\nmodel ~7!#. In contrast, from ~8! the LS decreases exponen-\ntially, x\u02dc(v)5Me2uvutp, where tp5Im tp , and tp is the pole\nor the branching point of the function l (0)(t). The\nasymptotic behavior of x\u02dc(v) is different, of course, if tp\n50, i.e., l (0)(t) has a singularity for real time. This happens,\nfor example, if the potential U(q) has singularities encoun-\ntered by the optimal path. Therefore it does not typically\noccur in dynamical systems.\nThe LS takes a particularly simple form for a white-\nnoise driven system.

Complete nonadiabatic escape theory\nThe notion of the LS makes it possible to find not only\nthe exponent, but also the prefactor in the escape rate, and\nthus to obtain a complete nonadiabatic solution of the escapeIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/ojps.aip.org\/chaos\/chocr.jsp\n590 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Dykman et al.problem for dynamically weak driving. Since the celebrated\nKramers paper,25 the calculation of the prefactor has been\none of the central problems in escape rate theory. For a pe-\nriodically driven system, the escape rate W(t) is periodic in\ntime. It can be introduced as a current j away from the meta-\nstable state, which is measured well behind the boundary qb\nof the attraction basin @for the model ~7! with F50, qb is the\nposition of the local maximum of the potential U(q)#. In the\nrange uU8(q)u@F the current scales with q as\nj~q ,t !5W@ t2td~q !# , dtd \/dq521\/U8~q !. ~10!\nEquation ~10! provides a meaningful definition of both\ninstantaneous and time-averaged escape rates. For weak driv-\ning, the values of the escape rate at different points q suffi-\nciently far behind qb(t) differ only by a phase shift td(q),\nwhich makes it possible to make a sensible measurement of\nW(t)5W(t1tF). For a white-noise driven system, an ex-\nplicit expression for the time-dependent escape rate W(t)\nand for W\u00af was obtained10 by combining the results on the LS\nwith the integral representation of the time-dependent prob-\nability density near qb . In particular, it was shown that\nW\u00af \/W05~2p!21E\n0\n2p\ndf exp@2dR~f\/vF!\/D# , ~11!\nwhere W0 is Kramers\u2019 escape rate in the absence of modula-\ntion for an overdamped system ~the type of systems which\nwe discuss in this paper!, and dR(tc) is given by Eq. ~8!.\nSince dR(tc) is a zero-mean periodic function, W\u00af al-\nways exceeds W0 . For small F\/D , the correction to W0 is\nquadratic in F\/D ~cf. Ref. 2!. In the opposite limit of large\nF\/D , the escape rate is changed exponentially, with\nln@W\u00af \/W0#\u20192D21 min dR(tc), which coincides with Eqs. ~5!\nand ~8!. The dependence of the escape rate on time and the\nparameters of the system for a simple metastable potential is\nillustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe time dependence of the escape rate W(t) and the\nchange of its form with varying parameters of the system, in\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to Aparticular with the frequency and amplitude of the driving\nforce, were analyzed in Refs. 10 and 26. The explicit form of\nthe probability distribution in the vicinity of the boundary\nqb(t) was obtained in these papers, too. One of the conclu-\nsions which follows from the results is that the prefactor in\nthe expression for the current j(t) calculated right on the\nboundary qb(t) has a totally different form from that in the\ncurrent well behind qb(t), which gives the observable rate\nW(t) ~10!. This is in contrast with what happens in the case\nof nondriven overdamped systems.25\nCalculating the current at the periodic boundary qb(t)\nwas the goal of the recent papers by Lehmann et al.27 As\nnoted before, the functional form of this current differs from\nthat of the coordinate-independent instantaneous escape rate.\nIn their analysis, Lehmann et al. adopted the idea,8,9 Fig. 2,\nof synchronization of optimal paths by a periodic field. The\nevaluation of the prefactor in Ref. 27 is based on an addi-\ntional specific conjecture. Most of the specific results refer to\na singular potential U(q) in Eq. ~7!: it consists of two\nopposite-sign parabolas matched between their extrema.\nHowever, the nonanalyticity of this potential should give rise\nto a deviation from the linear amplitude dependence of the\nactivation energy ~8! for comparatively small amplitudes of\nthe driving periodic force. The deviation will be strong\nwhere the amplitude of forced vibrations becomes compa-\nrable to the distance from the extrema of U(q) to the singu-\nlar point where the parabolas are connected, as was indeed\nobserved in Ref. 27. However, as we showed earlier by solv-\ning the variational problem ~5!, ~6! exactly9 ~cf. Fig. 2!, for\ngeneric analytic potentials the activation energy of escape is\nwell described by the LS in a broad range of field ampli-\ntudes.

We note that,\ngenerally, the LS is not a monotonic function of frequency:\nfor underdamped systems, it displays resonant peaks.8\nB. Switching between optimal paths\nWe now turn to the investigation of a specific feature of\nthe escape rate that is related to the minimization over tc in\n~8!. It is expected to arise for a nonsinusoidal field, and in\nparticular for a biharmonic one.8 Here, the periodic function\ndR(tc) may have two minima per period. However, the ac-\ntivation energy will always correspond to the absolute mini-\nmum of dR(tc). For a certain relation between the param-\neters, the values of dR(tc) at the two minima are equal. The\nsituation is then similar to the first-order phase transition\nwhere two minima of the free energy are equally deep. On\nthe opposite sides of the phase transition line the system is in\ndifferent states. In the present case, if the parameters pass\nthrough critical values where the minima of dR(tc) are\nequally deep, switching will occur from one minimum to the\nother.\nFor biharmonic driving, a convenient control parameter\nis the phase difference f12 between the field components F1 ,\nF2 .

DYNAMICAL SYMMETRY BREAKING IN A\nMODULATED BISTABLE OPTICAL TRAP\nA simple physical system which embodies fluctuation-\ninduced escape is a mesoscopic particle suspended in a liquid\nand confined within a metastable potential well. The particle\nmoves at random within the well until a large fluctuation\npropels it over an energy barrier.

Redistribution subject to AAn important experiment with a particle in a double-well\ntrap is a measurement of the transition rate in a stationary\npotential. Such an experiment can provide a rigorous test of\nthe multidimensional Kramers rate theory with no adjustable\nparameters. Quantitative measurements require that the con-\nfining potential be adequately characterized. This can be\ndone by measuring directly the full three-dimensional ~3D!\nstationary probability distribution r(r) of a trapped Brown-\nian particle.32\nA stable three-dimensional trap is produced by two fo-\ncussed laser beams as a result of the electric field gradient\nforces exerted on a transparent dielectric spherical silica par-\nticle of diameter 2R50.6 mm. Displaced typically by 0.25\nto 0.45 mm, the beams create a double-well potential, with\nthe stable positions of the particle centered at r1 and r2 . The\nstability perpendicular to the beam axis is due to the trans-\nverse beam profile gradient; in the beam direction the poten-\ntial gradient is derived from the strong focusing of the ob-\njective lens.30 Relatively infrequent thermally activated\nrandom transitions between the potential wells occur through\na saddle point at rs as depicted in Fig. 6. The experimental\nsetup and the measurement technique have been discussed\nelsewhere.32\nThe full double-well confining potential U(r) is deter-\nmined from the measured stationary distribution r(r) as\nU(r)52kBT ln r(r). From the depths and curvatures of the\npotential wells and the curvature of U(r) at the saddle point\nrs , it is straightforward to calculate the Kramers escape\nrates. These rates can also be measured directly by placing\nthe particle into one of the wells and measuring the average\ntime it takes to switch to the other well. The potential U(r),\nand the barrier height in particular, can be systematically\nvaried by changing the beam intensities. This results in an\nexponential change of the escape rate, thus making it pos-\nsible to compare theory and experiment over a wide range of\nthe escape rates. Extremely good agreement is obtained, as\nseen from Fig. 7.\nThe double-beam trap can also be used to investigate the\neffect of ac-modulation on transition rates. An interesting\napplication of this effect is to direct the diffusion of a particle\nin a spatially periodic potential.33 It follows from the results\nof Sec. II that, for a generic periodic potential, the ac-\nFIG. 6. ~Color online!

This makes the probabilities of transitions\nto the right and to the left exponentially different and results\nin diffusion in the direction of more frequent transitions.\nAn effect closely related to directed diffusion, but more\namenable to testing using optical trapping, is ac-field induced\nlocalization in one of the wells of a symmetric double-well\npotential. We expect both these effects to occur if the applied\nfield breaks the spatio-temporal symmetry of the system.8,34\nThe ratio of the stationary populations w\u00af1 ,w\u00af2 of the wells is\ndetermined by the ratio of the period-averaged rates W\u00af i j of\nthe interwell i\u2192 j transitions,\nw\u00af1 \/w\u00af25W\u00af 21 \/W\u00af 12}exp~@dR12dR2#\/kBT !, ~14!\nwhere dR1,2 are field-induced corrections to the activation\nenergies of escape from wells 1,2 ~8!.\nThe experiment was conducted35 for equal static barrier\nheights in the two wells DU15DU2[DU , with DU0 set at\n\u20197.5kBT . The intensity of a laser beam was then modulated\nby an electro-optic device, giving rise to modulation of\nDU\/kBT with an amplitude \u20192.5. The modulation fre-\nquency vF\/2p was varied between 1 and 100 Hz, which\ncovers the range from adiabatically slow to nonadiabatic\nmodulation ~the relaxation time is t rel;1022 s!. This may be\ncompared to the mean unmodulated transition rate W0\n;0.1 s21.

Redistribution subject to Awave form, there is only one optimal escape path per period,\nfor each well, and no switching between the paths occurred\nwith varying f12 .\nAs shown in the inset to Fig. 8, the difference between\nthe barrier heights in the two wells varies asymmetrically\nover the cycle. It depends on f12 and can be inverted if the\nphase angle is shifted by p. In other words, the modulated\npotential is not invariant under t\u2192t1p\/vF , x\u21922x , y\n\u21922y ~with x , y measured from the symmetry planes paral-\nlel to the beam axes, see Fig. 6!. It is this breaking of the\nspatio-temporal symmetry that leads to the escape rate from\none of the wells being on average much bigger than from the\nother, as seen from Fig. 8. In turn, this leads to a higher\npopulation in one of the wells. Not only has the effect been\nobserved for slow modulation, as evidenced by Fig. 8, but a\npopulation difference of 20% has been observed deeply in\nthe nonadiabatic regime, with vF\/2p520 Hz, for the modu-\nlation amplitude used. This is sufficient to create significant\ndirectional diffusion, and demonstrates the onset of dynami-\ncal symmetry breaking. The dependence of w\u00af1 \/w\u00af2 on the\nphase shift f12 is in agreement with the theory of Sec. III.35\nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS\nWe have shown theoretically, by analog and digital\nsimulations, and by optical trapping experiments that fluc-\ntuations in driven systems, and in particular escape from a\nmetastable state, can be effectively controlled by an external\nfield. The field gives rise to a change of the activation energy\nof escape, which can be much bigger than the characteristic\nnoise intensity ~temperature! even for comparatively weak\nfields. Over a broad range of field amplitudes, this change is\nlinear in the field even where the driving frequency exceeds\nthe reciprocal relaxation time of the system and substantially\nexceeds the escape rate. The effect is described by a physi-\ncally observable quantity, the logarithmic susceptibility. The\nLS relates the probability of large fluctuations in the pres-\nFIG. 8. ~Color online!

It displays a specific frequency dispersion, which\nmakes it possible to control, selectively, the escape rate of a\ntargeted system. The LS can be calculated, for a given model\nof the system, and can be measured experimentally.\nAn important application of the escape rate control is\ndirected diffusion in a spatially periodic potential. As we\nhave demonstrated, such control can be performed even for a\nsymmetric potential, in which case not only the rate, but also\nthe preferred direction of diffusion can be conveniently\nchanged by changing the driving field parameters.\nThe high efficiency of the escape rate modulation is\nlargely due to the synchronization of optimal escape paths by\nthe driving field. We have predicted and observed this syn-\nchronization. We have also observed the related effect of\nswitching between different branches of the activation en-\nergy as a function of the field parameters\u2014a generic phase-\ntransition type effect related to coexistence of different es-\ncape paths in systems away from thermal equilibrium.\nThe results of this research are relevant to biological\nsystems, since activated escape lies at the root of many bio-\nlogical processes at the molecular level, and modulation of\nthe escape rate is often the way nature exercises control.\nHowever, detailed understanding of how this control is per-\nformed is missing in most cases. This is a fundamentally\nimportant and most challenging open scientific problem.\nAnother important open problem of broad interest is\nwhether large fluctuations can be used to learn about the\ndynamics of a fluctuating system away from stable or meta-\nstable states. The underlying idea here is that, in large fluc-\ntuations, the system explores remote areas of the space of its\ndynamical variables. An example where fluctuations have\nbeen used to find the global potential in which a system is\nmoving was discussed in Sec. V. The problem becomes more\ncomplicated if the system dynamics is unknown. However,\ngiven that the system is most likely to move along a certain\npath during a large fluctuation, the observation of such paths\ncan enable one to infer a dynamical model of the system. The\nprocess can then be iterated, as indicated by recent results.36\nThe results described here are of interest also from the\nviewpoint of practical applications. An important example is\nthe separation of colloidal particles and macromolecules.\nOur experiments show that selectively directed diffusion is a\npromising new approach to this problem. Another example is\ncontrol of crystal growth using an ac field. The relevant\nnucleation rate will be changed by the field in a way similar\nto the escape rate. Therefore it should be possible to strongly\nmodulate it both in time and space.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by the NSF through Grants\nNos.
