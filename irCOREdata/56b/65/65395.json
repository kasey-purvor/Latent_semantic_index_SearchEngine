When an ice sheet is grounded below sea level,\nit tends to have a low profile surface compared to a classical\nconvex ice sheet surface profile. Surface drawdown is\ncaused by fast flowing ice stream features flowing predom-\ninantly by basal sliding over deformable marine sediments\n[e.g., Alley et al., 1986; Tulacyzk et al., 2000]. Vaughan and\nBamber [1998] compared an ice surface Digital Elevation\nModel (DEM) of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) with a\nmodeled analytical ice surface (following Vialov [1958]).\nThey identified nine low-profile regions where the mea-\nsured ice surface was more than 500 m lower than the\nmodeled ice surface (Figure 1). Eight of these regions\ncorrespond to areas where the ice sheet is known to be\ngrounded below sea level (five of these in the West AIS\n(WAIS)), a configuration widely believed to be inherently\nunstable due to a grounding line feedback mechanism [e.g.,\nWeertman, 1974; Schoof, 2007]. The continental East AIS\n(EAIS) is considered more stable, despite the existence of\nfour low profile regions.\n[3] Little is known directly about the basal topography in\nthe ninth region, L9, encompassing the Recovery Glacier\nand its catchment, where the observed surface velocities\nindicate that fast flow occurs well inland [Joughin and\nPadman, 2003]. The BEDMAP dataset [Lythe et al., 2001]\ncontains very few measurements in this region; hence what\nis known is mainly derived from indirect methods. Data\ninversion methods indicate that Recovery Glacier may be\ngrounded up to 1500 m below sea level [Joughin et al.,\n2006] and there may be a large region in the interior well\nbelow sea level [Warner and Budd, 2000]. Ice surface\nanalysis methods have been used to infer subglacial lakes\nin the low-slope region (slope <0.45 m km\u00ff1, Figure 1,\ninset) at the onset of fast flow [Bell et al., 2007]. Indirect\nmagnetic evidence of a sedimentary basin up to 800 m\nbelow sea level has been found in a neighboring tributary\nregion of Slessor Glacier (L7, Figure 1) [Rippin et al., 2003;\nBamber et al., 2006], causing basal motion to dominate the\nflow in the tributary [Rippin et al., 2006]. As a result of\nthese findings, it is feasible that there are water saturated\ndeformable sediments present in the Recovery Glacier\ncatchment, causing enhanced flow and surface drawdown.\n[4] Data on the basal topography are crucial for accurate\nnumerical modeling of marine-based ice sheets and for\nunderstanding the response of an ice sheet system to sea\nlevel change. This paper utilizes a terrain analysis technique\nwhich relates ice surface plan curvature to the bed topog-\nraphy, using a recent ice surface DEM [Rignot et al., 2008],\nin order to infer the bed topography in region L9.\n2. Plan Curvature\n[5] Across slope, or plan, curvature is a terrain analysis\ntechnique commonly used in hydrological applications to\nindentify convergent and divergent flow paths in catch-\nments. Re\u00b4my and Minster [1997] first suggested a link\nbetween the plan curvature (PC) of an ice sheet surface\nand the bed topography. The link between PC and basal\ntopography is first demonstrated here using an idealized\ncircular ice sheet, existing at a pole, limited in extent by\nlatitude (bed is an adjusted subset of BEDMAP, 5 km\nresolution).\n[6] The PC of the ice sheet surface is derived using a\nterrain analysis software package, TAS (Terrain Analysis\nSystem [Lindsay, 2005]). The algorithm requires the fitting\nof a partial quartic equation to the nine elevation points\nmaking up a 3 by 3 window on the surface elevation grid.\nThe PC is then a measure of the curvature transverse to the\nslope [see Zevenbergen and Thorne, 1987]. Negative values\nindicate convex PC, positive values indicate concave PC.\nApplying the PC technique to a 5 km resolution DEM leads\nto a spatially incoherent result (see auxiliary materials, e.g.,\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L16503, doi:10.1029\/2008GL034728, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n2Institute of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University,\nAberystwyth, UK.\n3Bristol Glaciology Centre, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/08\/2008GL034728$05.00\nL16503 1 of 6\nFigure S1a, applied to whole AIS).1 Longitudinal stresses\nwithin the ice tend to smooth out local scale variations in ice\nthickness over 10\u201320 times the ice thickness [Kamb and\nEchelmeyer, 1986], hence, at a 5 km scale, it is necessary to\napply a variable size, variable weight filter, dependent on\nthe ice thickness [following Kamb and Echelmeyer, 1986;\nLe Brocq et al., 2006]. Otherwise, a grid resolution of 20 km\nor greater must be used (Figures S1a\u2013S1d). The greater\nlevel of detail available in a higher resolution dataset leads\nto a 5 km resolution being employed here, using a smoothed\nice sheet surface. As we do not have a reliable measure of\nice thickness, we used the smallest filter that produced\ncoherent features (30 km, Figures S1e\u2013S1g).\n[7] If the entire base of the idealized ice sheet, outlined\nabove, was above sea level (henceforth, ASL ice sheet) and\nno deformable sediments were present (e.g., Figure 2a), the\nice sheet would flow through two mechanisms; internal\ndeformation [Glen, 1955] and classical Weertman sliding\n[Weertman, 1964]. These mechanisms are both considered\nto be driven by the basal shear stress, a function of surface\nslope and ice thickness (equivalent to the gravitational\ndriving stress). As the ice thickness decreases towards the\nextremities of the ice sheet, the surface slope must increase\nin order to maintain the ice sheet in a state of balance,\nleading to the classical convex surface profile of, for\nexample, Vialov [1958]. This will also lead to convex plan\ncontours (e.g., Figure 2b, numerical model result where\nbasal sliding is a linear function of the basal shear stress\n[e.g., Payne, 1998]) and, hence, convex PC values (Figure 2c).\nWhere the relative basal topography is lower than its sur-\nroundings, ice flow will be concentrated into outlet glaciers\nwhich will have a greater ice thickness due to the troughs\nthey flow through. As a result, these outlet glaciers would\nnot require such a steep slope to maintain ice flux, hence,\nslightly concave plan contours will result (e.g., feature 1 on\nFigures 2a\u20132c).\n[8] If areas of the bed beneath our idealized ice sheet\nwere below sea level and deformable sediments were\npresent (e.g., Figure 2d, henceforth BSL ice sheet),\nenhanced fast flow features can develop via sediment\ndeformation. These enhanced flow features have a low basal\nshear stress, causing surface drawdown and strongly con-\ncave plan contours (Figure 2e, numerical model result\nwhere basal sliding is a function of both the basal shear\nstress and the effective pressure [e.g., Budd et al., 1984]),\nand, hence, strongly concave PC values (Figure 2f). Inter-\nstream ridges, flowing by internal deformation only, will\nform between the fast flow features where relative bed\nelevations tend to be higher (cf. Siple Coast Ice Streams).\nHence, these inter-stream areas will develop convex plan\ncontours (Figure 2e). The resulting PC for the BSL ice sheet\n(Figure 2f) shows a good qualitative agreement with the\nbasal topography (Figure 2d). Inter-stream ridges and ice\ndivides complicate the picture, introducing highly convex\nvalues in areas where bed elevations are below sea level.\nDespite the potential difficulty in distinguishing between\nstrongly convex plan contours caused by interstream ridges\nor an area with the bed above sea level, the PC of the ice\nsurface has the potential to identify relative basal topogra-\nphy, but must be considered in the context of the setting\n(i.e., topographically constrained vs. non-topographically\nconstrained).\n[9] The above examples are very idealized; at a 5 km grid\nscale, strongly concave PC values will also be caused by\nsmall scale (<15 km), topographically controlled, conver-\ngent ice flow features with a steep slope (e.g., in the\nTransantarctic mountains). Therefore, some consideration\nneeds to be given to the scale of the flow features which are\ndiscussed in section 4, as well as their overall morphology.\nAt a 5 km scale, the shape of the ice sheet extent will not\nhave a large impact on the PC values. Table 1 summarizes\nthe key features of each idealized ice sheet, and the\nassociated level of curvature for each feature.\n3. Application to the Antarctic Ice Sheet\n[10] The PC algorithm was applied to the smoothed AIS\nice surface DEM (Figure 3a). PC values range from \u0018\u00ff0.01\nfor highly convex areas to \u00180.01 for highly concave areas,\nwhere 0 is rectilinear. The PC values generally correlate\nwell with the basal topography in areas where the base of\nthe ice sheet is below sea level and fast flow features are\npresent, whether this is in a topographically constrained\nsetting (e.g., Evans Ice Stream (inset 1, Figure 3)) or in a\nless constrained topographic setting (e.g., Siple Coast region\n(inset 3, Figure 3)). The existence of highly concave PC\nvalues largely corresponds to areas of bed that are below sea\nlevel, except for areas of extreme topographic relief causing\nstrongly convergent flow (e.g., the Transantarctic Mountains).\n4. Recovery Glacier\n[11] Having established that the technique is reliable for\nregions of the AIS where bed data are available, the1Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2008GL034728.\nFigure 1.

More recent data are\navailable for an area covering the Slessor Glacier tributaries\n[Rippin et al., 2003]; the correlation between an extract from\nthis dataset and the PC is also good (Figure 4c). Figure 4b\nhighlights the difficulty in distinguishing between areas of\nbedrock above sea level and areas which are likely to be\nfrozen to their bed; between 175 km and 240 km along the\nprofile, the measured bed is well below sea level, though it\ncorresponds to a convex PC value.\n4.1. Western Half of Recovery Glacier Catchment\n[12] The western half of the Recovery Glacier catchment\n(Figure 3a, west of inset 2, nearest to the grounding line)\ndisplays a range of PC values similar to both the Evans Ice\nStream and the Siple Coast region, with concave PC values\nup to \u00180.01. This range of PC values is only found\nelsewhere in the WAIS and the Transantarctic Mountains.\nSuch a large range is not found elsewhere in the interior of\nthe EAIS (>450 km inland), except at Lake Vostok, where\nthe presence of the lake significantly reduces the basal shear\nstress. The presence of highly concave PC values for flow\nfeatures of the size observed in this region (>30 km, with a\nlow surface gradient) indicates that there are areas where the\nbed elevation is well below sea level, and water-saturated\ndeformable sediments may exist, which are facilitating\nenhanced localized ice flow.\n[13] In order to determine the topographic setting in this\nregion, it is important to first determine whether it is high\nrelief or a differing thermal regime which is causing the\nFigure 2.

The numbers correspond to features discussed in the text (summarized in\nTable 1).\nTable 1.

Elevation data from ice free areas and\nthe general surface morphology indicate there are some\nareas of high relief in this region, hence, it is assumed that\nthe convex PC values are due to high relief. The PC values\nin this area can therefore be compared to elevations found in\nEvans Ice Stream and neighboring ice streams. Based on\nthis comparison, the bed could be up to 2500 m below sea\nlevel in the troughs.\n4.2. Low-Slope Region\n[14] In the interior low-slope region (Figure 3a, inset 2),\nthe presence of highly concave flow features and a large\nlow-slope region suggests that some, if not most, of the bed\nis well below sea level, despite the existence of slightly\nconvex PC values. The convex PC values are less extreme\nthan in the western half of the catchment (>\u00ff0.001), apart\nfrom some isolated values. The range of values is much\nFigure 3.

For an EAIS comparison,\nareas where the bed is well below sea level, for example in\nthe Slessor tributaries (>800 m below sea level), correspond\nto convex PC values similar to that found beneath the low-\nslope region. Depths from the single BEDMAP transect\nwhich crosses the low-slope region also support basal\ntopography up to 1000 m below sea level where convex\nPC values exist.\n5. Inferred Topography\n[15] Despite the good qualitative agreement between PC\nvalues and the known basal topography demonstrated in\nFigures 3 and 4, converting the PC values into a quantitative\nprediction of unknown basal topography is uncertain. The\nabove analysis of the PC results for region L9 leads to an\napproximate relationship between PC and basal topography\n(Figure 4d). PC values greater than \u00ff0.001 (slightly convex\nvalues and all concave values) give bed elevations below\nsea level, with a minimum value of 1500 m below sea level\n(the lowest observed in the region). PC values less than\n\u00ff0.001 (highly convex) give bed elevations above sea\nlevel, up to a value of 1000 m above sea level. This\nrelationship is therefore slightly biased to allow interior\nareas with slightly convex values to remain below sea level.\n[16] The quantitative relationship (Figure 4d) results in a\nlarge region of the EAIS where the bed is significantly\nbelow sea level (inset 4, Figure 2b) with some significant\nrelief in the western part of the catchment. The predicted\ntopography should not be taken as a precise quantitative\nrepresentation of the basal topography; however, it is a\nuseful indication of the nature of the basal topography, as\nthe determination of the qualitative topography is reason-\nably robust.\n6. Conclusions\n[17] This work has demonstrated the usefulness of terrain\nanalysis techniques in understanding the nature of flow in\nan ice sheet, and the potentially useful data that can be\ninferred from the ice surface morphology. The presence of a\nsignificant area of the EAIS, in the region of Recovery\nGlacier, exhibiting enhanced flow with a low surface\ngradient, and PC values similar to the WAIS suggests that\nthere may be a large basin with water saturated deformable\nsediments in the region, over 1000 m below sea level, with a\nplentiful supply of basal meltwater, connected to the coastal\nregions.\n[18] The presence of a large area of subglacial sediment\nbelow sea level in this region would have implications for\nthe stability of this sector of the EAIS, making it much more\nsensitive to oceanic forcing and possible grounding line\nmigration. The predicted basal topography adds a further\n1.0 \u0002 105 km3 of ice to the total volume of ice in Antarctica\n(previous estimate: 24.7 \u0002 106 km3 [Lythe et al., 2001]).\nHowever, as most of the ice is below sea level, it will\nalready have displaced seawater, so will not significantly\nincrease the total contribution of Antarctica to potential\nfuture global sea level rise. As suggested by Vaughan and\nBamber [1998], whether or not a large area of bed exists\nbelow sea level, with marine sediments, is of major impor-\ntance. The ice volume above buoyancy in the basin region\nalone is 9.5 \u0002 105 km3, equivalent to 2.6 m of global sea\nlevel rise (compared to an estimated 5 m for the WAIS\n[Lythe et al., 2001]). Ice outside of the basin region would\nalso be impacted by the thinning, raising this total sea level\nrise significantly. If the same grounding line instability\nthought to be occurring in the WAIS also occurs in this\nbasin, the region could contribute significantly to future\nglobal sea level rise.\n[19] Therefore, it is imperative for understanding of the\nnature of the EAIS, and reliable predictive modeling, that\nbasal topography is mapped in this area. The dataset\npresented here provides a useful guide to areas which\nrequire specific focus.\n[20] Acknowledgments. This research was funded as part of an\nNERC grant (NER\/G\/S\/2003\/00020).
