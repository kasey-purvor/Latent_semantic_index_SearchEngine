While certain types of \nhealth resources fall within the female domain (home-based treatment, caring and supportive \nroles, and knowledge surrounding particular reproductive conditions), access to most outside \nhealth practitioners, treatments and knowledge is controlled largely by men.  For pastoralist \nwomen, this means that actions taken during illness episodes depend largely on the nature \nand quality of social support systems available, and on their ability to mobilise them \neffectively.  These support systems include: husband and other affines, male kin, and \nnetworks of female kin and friends.  Factors such as position within domestic and wider \nsocial units, as well as life cycle, affect women\u2019s ability to access and mobilise these \ndifferent support systems for their health needs. \n \nHowever, seasonal mobility interacts with gender and social support systems in complex \nways that influence profoundly women\u2019s access to health resources.  Most literature on \nnomadic peoples and health focuses on the physical barriers posed by spatial mobility to \naccessing health resources.  However, it is suggested here that, for pastoralist women in \nChad, the spatial fluidity of social networks might be a more important consideration.  At \ncertain times of year women enjoy relatively easy access to a large range of extended kin and \nother social contacts, while at other times, when people are very dispersed, options become \nmuch more limited, often resulting in illness treatment being delayed.  Mobility should not, \nthough, be seen purely as a constraint.  It can also be an opportunity, increasing the potential \ngeographical and social resource base with regard to health for women. \n 4\nKeywords \nnomads, health, gender, social networks, Chad, pastoralists \n \n 5\nIntroduction \nNomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists form a small but significant minority of the \npopulations of countries throughout the Sahelian belt of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal, \nthrough Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, to the Horn of Africa.  The total pastoral \npopulation is estimated to be 30-40 million, of which a half are in Sub-Saharan Africa \n(Sandford 1983, cited by Swift et al 1990).  It is clear that Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole \nsuffers from under-provision of health services, with typically more than 10,000 people for \nevery doctor, compared with fewer than 500 throughout Western Europe (UNDP 1997).  \nHowever, several studies suggest that, within Sub-Saharan Africa, nomadic pastoralists face \nparticular barriers of access to health services (Sandford 1978, Meir 1987, Foggin et al 1997, \nLoutan 1989, Swift et al 1990, Zinsstag et al 1998).  Pastoralists tend to live in sparsely \npopulated, geographically marginal areas, while health services are typically concentrated in \nmore densely populated areas of permanent settlement.  Mobility in itself may restrict access, \nparticularly where extended courses of treatment are indicated.  Other barriers include \npolitical marginalisation, cultural, ethnic and linguistic differences with service providers, \nand very low levels of literacy. \n \nHowever, within the category of nomadic populations in general, dimensions such as gender, \nage and social status differentially ascribe vulnerability in terms of health status (Swift et al \n1990:17).  Because very little work has been done on these issues with relation to nomadic \ncontexts specifically, it is instructive to consider the wider literature on gender dimensions of \ndifferential access to health resources. \n \nConsiderable attention has been paid in recent years to the structural barriers women face in \naccessing health resources particularly in South Asia, but increasingly in sub-Saharan Africa \n 6\ntoo.  These result in part from unequal distribution of power and resources within domestic \narenas (Chen 1981; Pieras and Caldwell 1997; Unnithan-Kummar 1999), often compounded \nby institutional, cultural and educational barriers to services (Ojanuga and Gilbert 1992; \nPuentes-Makides 1992; Vlassoff and Bonilla 1994; Tanner and Vlassoff 1998).   \n \nIt is being increasingly recognised that there are also important differences between women \nin the access to health services that they (and their children) can command.  Das Gupta \n(1995) points to life cycle differences in women\u2019s autonomy and health outcomes.  The \nstages in the life course associated with high or low status vary between societies, but \u201cin \nmany societies, women spend part of their life cycle in double powerlessness, subordinated \nnot only to men but to other women at higher status stages of their own life cycles\u201d (ibid: \n481), which Das Gupta links to poorer access to health resources and negative health \noutcomes.  Success in bearing and rearing children can confer relative status and bargaining \npower to a woman within the domestic arena (eg. Last 1992: 807).  Household structure \n(monogamous \/ polygamous, nuclear \/ extended etc.) and a woman\u2019s position within it have \nalso been found to have a strong impact on the health resources she can command for herself \nand her children (Castle 1993; Oni 1996; Oruboloye et al  1991; Unnithan-Kummar 1999).  \nFinally, extra household kin support systems have been shown to play a very important role \nin determining women\u2019s access to health provision, particularly when domestic support \nsystems fail (Rahman 1999; Unnithan-Kummar 1999; McClain 1987; Oni 1996; Oruboloye \net al 1991). \n \nConsidering these issues within a nomadic context adds an extra dimension of complexity \nbecause of the seasonal fluidity of domestic units and wider social support networks. \n\u201cHouseholds\u201d themselves are notoriously difficult to define and identify, even in a sedentary \ncontext (Guyer 1981, Roberts 1991).  Household boundaries are often highly equivocal \n 7\n(Desai 1992) and convergence of interests between individuals who find themselves, perhaps \ntemporarily, sharing a hearth or a hut, cannot be assumed (Whitehead 1981; Roberts 1991; \nSen 1985, 1987; Oruboloye et al 1991, Caldwell & Caldwell 1987).  Where divorce and re-\nmarriage are common, women may move between several households over the course of a \nlifetime.  However, in nomadic populations, domestic units and larger social groups may \nshift both spatially and socially over the year, dividing and re-grouping, as people move with \ntheir herds on seasonal migrations (Hampshire 1998).  If a woman\u2019s access to health \nresources depends partly on her position in the domestic sphere, which itself shifts \nseasonally, then one might expect that access to be subject to seasonal variation too.  \nLikewise, the type and quality of kin and social support networks to which a woman has \naccess in times of illness may change, not only over the course of a lifetime, but also on a \nseasonal basis. \nAims of the Study \nIt is precisely this complexity and fluidity which must be explored in the context of the \naccess that nomadic women have to health resources.  The aim of this study are: \n1. to elucidate gender dimensions in the control and distribution of health resources \n(information, treatment, care) as perceived by nomadic pastoralist women in Chad; \n2. to examine the role of social support systems, within and beyond the domestic arena, in \nsecuring access to health resources for those women; \n3. to explore how seasonal fluidity in social and domestic organisation impinges on \nwomen\u2019s ability to mobilise networks to access health resources. \n \nThe approach taken is largely a qualitative, emic one, using local categories and belief \nsystems, and giving voice to nomadic women\u2019s own understandings of their situation. \n 8\nPastoralists of Central Chad \nChad forms part of the Sahelian belt of countries stretching across Africa just south of the \nSahara.  Since independence from France in 1960, it has been embroiled in thirty years of \ncivil war, and remains politically unstable.  Chad ranks low on most indices of economic \ndevelopment and welfare, with a GNP of $190 (UNDP 1994, cited in DHS 1998).  The most \nrecent census, in 1993, put the total population of Chad at around 6,300,000 people, with \nnomads constituting 5.7% of the total (350,000)  (BCR 1995, cited in DHS 1998).   \n \nThe health situation in Chad overall remains poor, with high mortality rates and poor access \nto health services (table 1), even by comparison with other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.  No \nseparate data are available for the nomadic groups, but indices of health are generally poorer \nin rural areas than in towns and cities. \n \nThis study was based in the Northern part of the Chari-Baguirmi Region of Central Chad \n(figure 1).  It is a semi-arid area with annual rainfall of 300-500mm, almost all falling in the \nrainy season late June to early September (Le Rouvreur [1959] 1989).  The main economic \nactivities in the region are extensive pastoralism and rainfed agriculture.  Most agricultural \nactivities are concentrated into the short rainy season, although greater water availability \naround Lake Chad makes year round cultivation possible in some areas.  A variety of \nanimals are herded by nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists: cattle, camels, sheep and \ngoats, as well as donkeys for transport. \n \nMany groups of nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists live in central Chad, alongside \nsedentary cultivators.  Most of the pastoralists fall into three broad ethnic categories: Arab, \nGoran and Fulani (Le Rouvreur [1959] 1989).  In all three groups, transhumance movements \nmean considerable geographical displacement (often hundreds of kilometres) over the course \n 9\nof a year, as well as mobility in the organisation of social and domestic units.  There is \nconsiderable variation between camps in the patterns of movement and the distances \ntravelled, according to: needs of the herd, extent of involvement with agriculture, ethnic \nidentity, rights over land and relationships with other groups. \n \nAll the nomadic \/ semi-nomadic pastoralist groups in Central Chad are Muslim, although \ntypically incorporating many aspects of traditional belief systems.  They are strongly \npatrilineal, with property inheritance operating through patrilineal descent groups.  While, \nunder Islamic Law, women are entitled to a share of inheritance, most women have very \nlittle control over these resources.  Both inheritance and bridewealth animals are \ntheoretically the property of women but are controlled by men: fathers, brothers, sons or \nhusbands.  The only significant independent source of income for women is through selling \nmilk, once domestic consumption needs have been met.  However, the economic power this \nconfers is limited: the amounts of money involved are small, milk selling is a highly seasonal \nactivity, and not all women have surplus milk to sell. \n \nAll three groups also operate a largely patrilocal system, although this is often quite flexible.  \nWomen often stay for some time following marriage in their own households, particularly \nwhen marriage is early. Continued or intermittent matrilocality is particularly likely with \nclose kin marriages, where natal and marital homes are likely to be close, both \ngeographically and socially.  As well as moving between natal and marital homes, many \nwomen have more than one marital home in a lifetime, since divorce is common.  Childless \nwomen are particularly vulnerable to divorce, and thus have a very unstable and insecure \nsocial position. \n 10\nMethods \nTwo months of intensive fieldwork were carried out in June - August 1999 (the early rainy \nseason).  (Two years of fieldwork had been undertaken previously by the author on health \nand demographic issues among similar groups of semi-nomadic pastoralists in Sahelian \nBurkina Faso).  Three fieldwork sites were used for this study.  These are shown, together \nwith major migration routes for each, in figure 1. \n \n1. A highly nomadic camp of Arab (Ouled-Rachid) camel herders, near Dourbali at the time \nof fieldwork. \n2. Several small, closely grouped, nomadic camps of Goran cattle-herders passing near \nBirbaka, some of whom supplemented pastoralism by growing millet. \n3. A recently semi-sedentarised Fulani village, Kassamre, just north of Dougia. \n \nA few Fulani had begun settling in Kassamre two years before the fieldwork.  In most cases, \nthe Fulani herding units (gure, sing. wuro) were divided for much of the year, with some \npeople remaining in Kassamre to cultivate, while others moved with the main herd north-east \nin the rainy season and south-west for much of the dry season.  Other Fulani gure in \nKassamre were still fully nomadic, just passing through at the time of fieldwork.  The choice \nof Kassamre as a field site enabled some comparison between nomadic and recently settled \nFulani. \n \nIn each fieldsite, individual interviews were conducted by the author with women to elicit \ndetailed qualitative information on recent illness episodes, occurring within the two years \npreceding fieldwork.  Illness episodes were defined as periods of ill-health severe enough to \nprevent the woman from being able to carry out at least one of her normal duties (pounding \nmillet, fetching water, cooking, childcare etc.) for several days.  In order to establish routes \n 11\nof access to health resources, and the role of social support systems, questions were asked \nspecifically about: symptoms and the process of diagnosis; processes of decision-making \nabout courses of action; details of who provided information, advice, financial or other \nmaterial resources, and care; and outcome.  Interviews were often long and wide-ranging.  \nWhere appropriate, questions on pregnancy, childbirth and reproductive health were \nincluded.  Illness free-listing techniques were also employed to clarify local perceptions and \nclassifications of illness, the results of which are not reported in detail here.  In the Arab and \nGoran camps, all adult women (defined as ever-married) were interviewed.  In the Fulani \ncamp, a random sample of approximately half of the households was taken.  Altogether, \nindividual interviews were conducted with 82 women: 23 Arab, 30 Goran and 29 Fulani,  \nBetween them, these women reported on 134 illness episodes in the two years preceding the \ninterview. \n \nIn addition, informal, free-ranging discussion sessions were held with several groups of \nwomen, covering a number of topics relating to health, illness, and the social and economic \nposition of women.  In each fieldsite, interviews were also conducted with the chief and a \ngroup of male elders about health, migration and livelihoods.  Finally, it was possible to \nobserve directly what happened in illness episodes occurring during the period of fieldwork. \n \nThe official languages of Chad are French and Arabic, although Goran and Fulfulde are \nspoken in preference by Goran and Fulani groups respectively.  The author speaks French \nand Fulfulde.  All interviews were conducted in the preferred language of the informants, via \nFrench-speaking female interpreters where necessary. \n \nThe methods adopted were subject to the following limitations: \n 12\n1. The use of retrospective reporting on illness episodes inevitably poses the risk of recall \nbias.  Recent illness episodes are likely to be recalled in more detail and with greater \naccuracy than those occurring longer ago.  Moreover, because the fieldwork took place \nduring the early rainy season, it is likely that people thought disproportionately about \nillnesses associated with the rainy season. \n2. Although the interpreters used were trained and competent, some subtleties of meaning \nare inevitably lost during translation. \n3. Relatively few men were interviewed, so the analysis presented here of gender issues with \nregard to the distribution and control of health resources is largely from the women\u2019s \nperspective. \nGender Dimensions of Health Resources: Information, Treatment and Care \nFrom the perspective of Chadian women, control and distribution of health resources \n(information, treatment and care) are strongly gendered.  This becomes clear from the \nwomen\u2019s accounts of actions taken and outcomes of recent illness episodes, and subsequent \ndiscussion. \n \nVarious treatment options were used by women during periods of illness.  Of the 134 \nreported recent illness episodes, 101 were treated in some way (table 2).  Nearly a third of \ntreatments were home remedies: self-treatment with products already in the home.  Another \nform of self-medication was purchasing modern medicines from local markets without \nadvice from a health professional (eg. paracetamol, chloroquine, and sometimes antibiotics).  \nHealth practitioners operating in the \u201cinformal\u201d sector include: Marabouts (Islamic teachers \nwith the power to treat illness, usually by reciting Qur\u2019anic verses); other \u201ctraditional\u201d \nhealers who claim knowledge of plant and herbal remedies; and traditional birth attendants \nand \u201cwise women\u201d.  Also in this category might be included Dr. Choukou, wandering \n 13\npractitioners with no formal medical qualifications who sell and claim to have knowledge of \n\u201cmodern\u201d medicines: pills, injections and intravenous drips.  Formal sector health provision \nconsists of local health posts located in most sedentary towns and large villages, funded \nmostly by government and bilateral donors, with nurses trained to administer injections and \nother basic healthcare; plus hospitals and private clinics located in the capital, N\u2019Djamena.  \nIn some cases (23 out of 101), multiple treatment types were used, usually sequentially, as a \nresponse to the failure of a particular treatment, although there was no predominating \nhierarchy of resort. \n \nNot all treatments are equally valued.  Home remedies are generally thought of as the least \nbeneficial, and bring temporary relief rather than permanent results.  However, they are the \nmost readily accessible: they are cheap (usually effectively free), and do not involve \nconsulting anyone else.  Remedies purchased from markets or from Dr. Choukou are often \ntreated with suspicion, unless the person is familiar with the illness and the treatment (eg. it \nis very widely known that chloroquine is needed to treat malaria).  The relative values \nattached to Marabouts, traditional plant healers and nurses from local health posts vary \nbetween individuals, partly as a function of religious conviction, but most people see city \nhospitals and clinics as being of high status.  Interestingly, the status accorded does not \nnecessarily correspond to the perceived outcomes of treatments, and the perceived success \nrate for all treatments was low.  However, with maraboutage (and perhaps modern \ntreatments), it is not  proven efficacy, so much as potential power and ritual significance \nwhich confers their status. \n \nCertain forms of knowledge and treatment fall within the female domain.  These tend to be \nlower status forms, and happen largely within, or close to, the domestic sphere.  Most \ncommon are remedies based on ingredients found around the home, typically butter and \n 14\ncow\u2019s urine drunk as a purge.  Other often used ingredients are garlic and chillies.  Although \ngenerally regarded as inferior treatments, they are recognised to bring temporary relief to \nmany conditions.  Information, advice and ingredients for home remedies are held by, and \nexchanged between, women. \n \nSecondly, childbirth and associated difficulties are dealt with by women only.  Mothers and \nother female kin are the most common birth attendants among the Arab and Goran groups.  \nHowever, when childbirth is problematic, local traditional birth midwives are used: old \nwomen with no formal training, who are reputed for their skill as birth attendants.  Three \nsuch women in the Arab camp were interviewed; each had stories to tell of saving mothers \nand babies in adverse circumstances through, for example, manipulating the position of the \nfoetus.  Such birth attendants are much rarer among the Fulani, who have a strong cultural \npreference (not always adhered to) of unassisted birth (see Hampshire, forthcoming). \n \nKnowledge and treatment of certain other reproductive health problems also fall exclusively \nwithin the female domain.  For example, the Arab disease djagandu (a fleshy protuberance \nfrom the vagina, usually following childbirth, which is believed to cause sterility) cannot be \ntreated by male practitioners.  Only particular old women have the requisite knowledge and \npower.  Other reproductive health problems are typically dealt by women in the home, at \nleast in the first instance, not because men do not have the power to treat them, but because \nthey are strongly associated with shame and embarrassment.  An example is a condition \nknown by Arab women as ri and by Goran women as ouan (white vaginal discharge due to \n\u201cwind\u201d entering the vagina during childbirth).  While ri or ouan is amenable to treatment by \ncertain male practitioners, it is usually treated in the home with butter oil. \n \n 15\nMost other health knowledge and treatment lies firmly within the male domain, outside of \nmost women\u2019s direct experience or control.  This includes all the higher status health \npractitioners who operate outside the home: \u201ctraditional\u201d healers (Marabouts and plant \nhealers) and \u201cmodern\u201d health facilities, as well as Dr. Choukou.  These practitioners are the \npreferred sources of treatment for most ailments, including many more serious reproductive \nhealth problems, such as extended bleeding following miscarriage, where home remedies \nand old \u201cwise women\u201d are deemed inadequate.  \n \nPart of the reason for male control of outside, higher status healers is that, in these \npatriarchal societies, most resources are controlled by men, and most treatments of all kinds \ncost considerable sums of money.  Engaging the services of a marabout entails slaughtering a \nsheep at the minimum, and medicines purchased from Dr. Choukou or health posts often cost \nmore than 15.000 FCFA (US$ 22).  Cultural and institutional factors operate too.  Modern \nhealth posts can be alien and frightening to many pastoralist women, especially to those \nGoran and Fulani women who feel insecure communicating in Arabic, which adds to their \nfeelings of insecurity in clinical settings.  Almost all nurses in health posts are men.  \n\u201cTraditional\u201d treatments lie also almost exclusively within the male domain.  A woman \ncannot usually approach a marabout directly (unless he happens to be a close relative): the \nrelationship has to be mediated through a man.  Knowledge of plants and other traditional \ntreatments is also held only by men from certain lineages, and is usually inherited from \nfather to son.  Women interviewed, even the wife and daughters of a plant healer, claimed \nignorance of all but one or two very basic remedies. \n \nIt is, therefore, expected that men will take responsibility and control for the healthcare \nneeds of their womenfolk where outside practitioners are required (ie. for any condition for \nwhich home remedies are deemed inadequate).  For married women, the husband is \n 16\nsupposed to be primarily responsible; and for women who are single, widowed or divorced, \nthis might involve fathers, brothers or sons.  This is borne out by analysis of illness episodes.  \nOf 74 illness episodes reported by women where treatment entailed some financial outlay \n(paying practitioners and\/or purchasing medicines), 67 were paid for (at least in part) by \nmen.  As well as contributing financially, it is also usually the men who initiate such \ntreatments, since they are held to control the knowledge about, and access to, the \npractitioners. \n \nAlthough most knowledge and access to health practitioners outside the home are under the \ncontrol of men, the caring and supporting roles for women during periods of illness are \nprovided largely by other women.  These take a number of forms.  The many daily tasks \nwomen have to perform are long and arduous: fetching water, pounding millet and preparing \nfood, preparing and selling butter or soured milk, childcare, weaving grass mats, setting up \nand dismantling tents etc.  In many cases women reported their mothers and sisters coming \nto look after them and relieve them of these daily tasks during periods of ill-health.  Without \nsuch help, it can be difficult for women to take the time off necessary to seek and pursue \ncertain forms of treatment, as well as to rest.  Many women agreed that the outcome of an \nillness episode might depend as much upon the support a woman received to allow her to \nrest, as on access to health practitioners.   \n \nThis is well illustrated by the case of Mariam1, a married Goran woman of about forty years \nold, chronically ill with amfoula (bad cough and chest pains).  It was difficult to find time to \ntalk to Mariam, because she was always very busy: getting up before dawn to fetch water \nand pound millet before setting off to the fields to work.  She would return at sunset to cook \nthe millet she had prepared in the morning for her family at night.  She said that no matter \nhow ill she was, she could not rest because there was no one else to do her work for her.  Her \n 17\nonly daughter was still a young child, her mother was dead and  she had no living brothers or \nsisters.  Although she lived in a wealthy extended household with her mother-in-law and \nsisters-in-law, none of them ever offered to help.  She was convinced that the reason she was \nnot getting better was that she had no opportunity to rest. \n \nMoral support and encouragement is also provided by women.  This includes encouraging, \nand even cajoling women into asking their menfolk for help; and sometimes mediating with \nappropriate men to mobilise support where the woman does not feel able to approach the \nmen herself, perhaps due to shame or fear of reprisals (discussed below).   \n \nIn summary, pastoralist women in Chad see health resources: information, treatment and \ncare, as being strongly gendered.  Most information and access to health treatments outside \nthe home, which are generally of high status, are controlled almost exclusively by men.  \nHome remedies, treatment of certain reproductive health conditions, and caring \/ supporting \nroles fall within the female domain.  This has important implications in terms of the access \nthat pastoralist women command to different kinds of health resources (i) in different \ndomestic or social circumstances and (ii) at different times of year.   \nThe Role of Social Support Systems in Women\u2019s Access to Health Resources \nBecause much health information and provision lies within the male domain, the access that \nwomen have to those health resources depends greatly on their access to men who are able \nand willing to provide them.  Access to other kinds of health resources, home remedies, care \nand support, depends more on the availability of networks of female kin and friends.  \nDifferences in the extent and nature of social support systems women are able to mobilise \ncan thus have a very large impact on the outcomes of illness episodes.  This is well \n 18\nillustrated by the following case study, of two women living, at the time of fieldwork, in \nadjacent tents within the same domestic unit. \n \nHalima, a married Arab woman with several young children, had suffered from ouaram (a \ndisease complex associated with heat and swelling) following her last pregnancy.  It was her \nmother-in-law, Fatima, who diagnosed the condition.  Halima\u2019s husband and her own parents \ntook her to a health post, where she was given some pills and injections, paid for by her \nhusband and her brother.  The medicines failed to make her better, so her mother then took \nher to a male relative, a Marabout, who gave her an infusion to drink.  (At the time, her \nhusband was away on transhumance).  During her illness, her mother also came to nurse her \nand to help out with childcare. \n \nMeanwhile, Fatima (Halima\u2019s mother-in-law), a very old widow, was suffering with eye \nproblems (ouadja :aayn).  Several years previously, a twig had poked her in the eye.  She \nasked her two sons (one of whom is Halima\u2019s husband) to take her to the health post or to a \nmarabout, but they refused.  Instead she took the advice of a friend of hers (another elderly \nwidow), and used various home \/ market remedies.  She applied the urine of a young child \nover a period of two days.  This was unsuccessful, so next she tried putting battery acid in \nthe sore eye, combined with the powder out of a capsule that her friend had given her.  Her \neye became worse as a result, and since then she had asked her sons many times for help, but \neach time they refuse, and get annoyed when she asks. \n \nFatima and Halima described several other recent illness episodes.  Each time, Halima had \nreceived a variety of treatments provided by her husband and her own (usually male) kin, \nand had had support during the illness from her mother; while Fatima had had largely to \ncope alone, sometimes with the (dubious) advice of her friend.  In the last rainy season, for \n 19\nexample, both Halima and Fatima had suffered from ouirde (rainy season fever).  Halima\u2019s \nbrother bought her chloroquine pills from the market, and her mother had come to nurse her \nthrough the illness.  Meanwhile, Fatima had done nothing: no one, she said, was prepared to \nbuy her medicines. \n \nWhy do some women have better access to supportive kin \/ social networks than others?  A \nwoman\u2019s networks may be divided into (i) husband and affines; (ii) her own kin.  These will \nbe considered separately. \nHusbands and Affines \nA husband is supposed to take full charge of his wife\u2019s health needs.  Yet in only 41 out of \n121 illness episodes occurring to currently married women did the husband (or his kin) help \nseek or finance treatment.  Why do husbands help out in some cases but not in others?   \n \nFirstly, not all illnesses are appropriate for male intervention.  Minor ailments, particularly \nthose associated with reproductive health, are believed to be best dealt with in the home, or \nby female friends and neighbours.  Other illnesses may require outside treatment, but the \nwoman might not feel in a position to mention the problem to her husband or to ask him for \nhelp.  Certain conditions are associated with shame and embarrassment.  In a discussion with \na group of young Arab women, three illnesses were said to be too shameful to discuss with \nhusbands and affines: sabib (diarrhoea), abasur (pains in the rectum, accompanied by sabib), \nand djagandu (fleshy protuberance from the vagina).   \n \nFor Fulani women, a much greater range of conditions may be unacceptable to mention to a \nhusband.  An important part of pulaaku, the sense of Fulani identity, involves the ability to \nmaster and control one\u2019s physical body, and not to express any sign of physical weakness \n 20\n(eg. Hopen 1958; Riesman 1977).  This is particularly important in front of one\u2019s husband or \naffines, with whom there is a relationship of distance and respect.  The fear of shame may be \ncompounded by fear of reprisals from affines and, in particular, co-wives.  This point is well \nillustrated by the case of Rabiatou, a young Fulani wife, who had been suffering with naora \nredu (bad stomach pains) and jonte (fever) for several months.  She had done nothing to try \nto remedy the condition, and had continued with her daily tasks despite feeling very ill.  She \nwas too ashamed to tell her husband or anyone else in her marital household about it, and she \nhad neither the money nor the resources to do anything herself.  She was particularly fearful \nthat her older co-wife would exploit the shame she would feel from disclosing her illness to \nher husband\u2019s family. \n \nHowever, even when a woman has an illness known to her husband, which requires health \nresources from within the male domain, there still appears to be considerable variation in \nwhether or not those resources are forthcoming.  Women suggested that this variation was at \nleast partly a function of the personality of the husband, and of the relationship between \nhusband and wife.  Haoua, an Arab women, said her husband had always been attentive to \nher health needs.  Last year, during an episode of ouirde (rainy season fever), her husband \npurchased chloroquine for her, without her even having to ask.  The contrast with her \nneighbour, Amne, is striking.  Amne had been ill for two years, suffering at night with \nbackache, preventing her sleeping properly.  Despite frequent pleas, her husband refused to \nseek treatment for her and was generally unsympathetic.  In the ensuing discussion it was \nacknowledged that, to some extent, having a helpful husband or not was just a matter of luck. \n \nBut women also suggested that there are other, more structural, reasons why some married \nwomen have better access to their husbands\u2019 attention than others.  Divorce is common, and \na woman\u2019s position in her marital household is extremely vulnerable until she has borne \n 21\nchildren (preferably sons).  Until a woman has shown that she is likely to be a permanent \naddition to her husband\u2019s household and lineage, the husband (and his kin) may be reluctant \nto invest resources in her health treatment.  Having borne children with her present husband \nstrongly improves a woman\u2019s chances of receiving financial support from her husband \nduring an illness episode.  If the sons she has borne are old enough to have brought their own \nwives into the household, her position is firmly established.  These perceptions are supported \nby table 3, which shows husbands were more likely to provide resources for health treatment \nwhen their wife had borne children, and particularly if the children were old enough to be \nmarried. \n \nYounger wives (as well as permanently sub-fecund women) are less likely to receive support \nfrom husbands than older women, who have proven their fertility.  It may also be that \nyounger wives feel less able to disclose their health problems in a marital home within which \nthey have not secured their position fully.  These points closely reflect the findings of Last \n(1992) and Das Gupta (1995), that the power (and therefore command over health resources) \naccorded to a woman varies as a function of her success in bearing and rearing children, and \nher life cycle position respectively.  However, when a woman becomes widowed (like \nFatima), her status and value can plummet. \n \nApart from proven fertility and age, the structure of the marital household, and the woman\u2019s \nposition within it also appear to influence the likelihood of receiving treatment help from \nhusband or other affines (cf. Castle 1993).  In particular, young married women feel they are \nmore likely to receive help from husbands when there are not many other young women \nabout, competing for attention and resources.  Thus, monogamously married women were \nthought to be in a better position that those in polygynous unions.  In particular, senior wives \ncomplain that they are neglected when their husbands take younger, more attractive new \n 22\nwives.  And young wives in nuclear households at the time of illness were thought to fare \nbetter than their counterparts in laterally extended households, in terms of mobilising health \nresources from their husbands.  Women are constantly aware of their social vulnerability \nwithin marital homes, which can create some tension and competition between co-wives or \nsisters-in-law. \nOwn Kin Networks \nAlthough husbands are theoretically charged with meeting the healthcare needs of their \nwives, in many cases women have to turn elsewhere.  Access to suitable networks of one\u2019s \nown male kin may become essential if the woman is currently unmarried, or if \nhusband\/affine support is either not suitable or not forthcoming, for some combination of the \nfactors addressed above.  In 23 of the reported recent illness episodes, women turned to their \nown male kin (fathers, brothers, sons or uncles) for help in accessing particular health \npractitioners or paying for treatment. \n \nFemale kin are usually considered to be much more reliable and far preferable in terms of \nproviding caring and supportive roles during illness than members of the marital household: \nin-laws and co-wives (illustrated by the case of Mariam, the Goran woman in the large \nextended household).  In particular, during pregnancy, when care and support are needed, \nthere may be fears of witchcraft surrounding jealous co-wives and sisters-in-law, which \nmakes them undesirable carers.   \n \nThe access that women have to their own kin varies considerably.  Older women often rely \non grown up sons, and Rahman (1999), working in rural Bangladesh, also found that having \nsons significantly improved the health prospects of elderly women.  However, it is not \nalways certain that sons will be prepared to help out.  Once a woman becomes widowed, her \n 23\nstatus drops considerably and without a husband to take her part, she might find herself \nneglected by her sons (as in the case of Fatima above).  Rahman (1999) also found that \nhaving brothers decreased elderly women\u2019s mortality risk, and there were several cases in \nthis study where elderly widowed women had moved in with their younger brothers, who \ntook care of their health needs, although to varying degrees. \n \nFor young married women, a lot depends on proximity to the natal household.  All first \nmarriages are arranged by the families, and there is a strong preference for marriage between \nclose kin, often first cousins.  Close kin marriage has the advantage for women that natal and \nmarital homes are likely to be close together for much of the year, permitting easy access to \nown kin.  Young women married to close kin frequently come and go between their marital \nand natal homes, and maintain close links for many years.  In a much more vulnerable \nposition are women who marry a long way (geographically or in terms of kinship) from their \nown families, as the following case study illustrates.  However, one disadvantage of close \nkin marriage, pointed out by several women, is that a close kin husband might shirk his \nresponsibility towards his wife, knowing that she has other relatives to depend upon. \n \nKaltouma and Sadia were both young, married, Arab women of about 14 or 15 years old.  \nKaltouma had married her father\u2019s brother\u2019s son.  The two brothers had separate herds but \nstuck closely together, and Kaltouma came and went between them.  At the time of \ninterview, she was staying in her natal household, while her husband was away on \ntranshumance.  Recently she had an illness called najbi (painful lumps in her eyes).  Her \nhusband was away at the time, and her father immediately sought a Marabout, who gave her \na gris-gris (charm) and holy ink with which to wash her face.  Although the treatment was \nnot entirely successful, she had male kin networks who were prepared to invest considerable \nresources in her health.   \n 24\n \nSadia was a daughter-in-law in the same domestic unit, polygamously married to the eldest \nson of the household head.At the time of interview, she was quite ill, with a high fever, lying \ndown.  She said she had been suffering on and off from ouadjar ras (headache accompanied \nby fever) for the last three years.  Before she was married, her father had taken her to a \nMarabout, who gave her a gris-gris, which had relieved the problems considerably.  \nHowever, when she came to live in her husband\u2019s household, she lost the gris-gris, and the \nouadjar ras returned, accompanied by ouadjar souloup (lower back pain).  Her husband has \nnot done anything to help, and she could not ask him.  Her own father was now dead, and her \nmother and father\u2019s brother were in Sudan, too far away to be able to help.  With an \ninattentive husband, no kin close by, and no income of her own, she had no recourse to help. \n \nIn summary, because of the ways in which health resources are strongly gendered, such that \ndifferent resources are mobilised through different kin and social networks, it is clear that \nwhat happens to a woman during a period of ill-health is dependent to a substantial degree \non the networks available to her and on her ability to mobilise them effectively.  Women \nwithout good access to husband\/affine networks (unmarried women, childless women, junior \nwives in extended households), or good access to male kin networks (married women living \nfar from natal homes), or good access to female support networks of friends and kin, are in a \nvery vulnerable position.  Similarly vulnerable are women who have networks in theory, but \nwho are not able to mobilise those networks to address their health problems for reasons of \nshame, or because those networks are not appropriate for the health resources required.  I \nnow begin to address the major issue among nomadic populations of seasonal mobility, and \nhow this impacts on networks and women\u2019s ability to access them. \n 25\nMobility, Seasonality and Networks \nProblems that highly mobile populations face in terms of accessing healthcare services are \noften expressed in terms of their spatial mobility and geographical dispersion, which pose \nphysical problems of access at certain times of year in particular.  This is certainly true for \nnomadic women in Chad.  When people are very distant from sedentary towns and villages, \nit becomes difficult to access certain forms of health treatment.  One Goran women said that, \nlast cold season, she had suffered from bad ouarama (equivalent to the Arab term ouaram, \nan illness complex associated with heat and swelling), but she had not been able to treat it \nbecause she was too far away from any markets or villages.  Other women reported this to be \na problem at different times of year, according to the seasonality of migration.   \n \nMovement itself can also be a problem.  Another Goran woman reported that her treatment \nin N\u2019Djamena hospital following a very serious miscarriage was curtailed because her family \nwere about to move north for the rainy season, and she did not want to be left behind.  Her \nneighbour reported that she had been suffering from amfoula (bad cough and painful chest) \nlast cold season.  She went to a local health post, where the nurse told her that she needed a \nparticular medicine that was not available immediately: she would have to wait two weeks \nfor the order to come through. However, in those two weeks her family had moved a \nconsiderable distance, and it was too far to go back to collect the medicine.   \n \nThe problem can be compounded by seasonal peaks in various illnesses coinciding with \npeople being distant from health services.  The rainy season, for example, is associated \nthroughout the Sahel with a peak in many diseases associated with water, particularly \nmalaria.  However, it is during the rainy season that many groups are moving very rapidly \nand travel far north, where there are very few settlements and health posts or markets. \n \n 26\nHowever, I suggest that potentially far more important than physical or geographical barriers \nare the social barriers that nomadic women experience in terms of healthcare access.  The \nlack of direct access to health information and resources combined with inadequate social \nnetworks may be more of a barrier to healthcare for women than being nomadic in itself.  \nThis point is clearly illustrated by looking at recently settled Fulani women.  For a few, \naccess to health services had improved.  One such woman, who had been ill during her \nsecond pregnancy, had been taken to the nearby health post by her husband for treatment.  \nShe compared the experience favourably with her first pregnancy, when she had also been \nvery ill, but had been unable to visit a health post because she and her family were moving \non transhumance.  Similarly, during my stay in the Fulani village, a woman who was having \ntrouble with delivering twins was rushed to hospital in N\u2019Djamena, using a vehicle flagged \ndown on the nearby road.  This was have been difficult, if not impossible, in a nomadic \nsetting, far from roads. \n \nBut most settled Fulani women made little use of the health post 3-4 km away.  Although \nthey were no longer mobile, they still faced the same social and economic barriers as before, \nin terms of their ability to access new health resources.  Indeed, the economic situation of \nmost Fulani women had worsened with sedentarisation, because with most of the cattle herds \naway, there was no surplus milk to sell, so even purchasing a few chloroquine tablets from a \nmarket became something for which they had to depend on others.  And women faced the \nsame problems of alienation with respect to formal health services.  Few felt comfortable \nwith staff from the local health post, who were all men from a sedentary ethnic group.  \nOverall, then, being settled, at least in the early years, does not confer any obvious advantage \nto women in terms of health treatment (table 4, although ethnicity may be a confounding \nfactor).  This reflects closely the experience among Bedouin groups in Israel, who saw little \n 27\nor no improvement in access to health services on sedentarisation, since social and cultural \nbarriers to access had not been removed (Meir 1987).   \n \nIndeed it has been suggested (Wiese 1999, pers. comm.) that nomads sometimes have an \nadvantage because of their mobility, since they are not stuck with the health centre nearest to \nthem, but are equipped to travel elsewhere.  One Goran woman reported that, during a very \nsevere dose of ghighi (rainy season fever), she was transported, unconscious and strapped to \na camel, to the health centre in Dourbali, a large town, where she received more effective \ntreatment than she probably would have done at a smaller health post. \n \nHowever, mobility and dispersion have important implications for health in other ways.  I \nhave already shown that kin and social networks of various kinds are of crucial importance \nto nomadic women in accessing health information and resources.  In these nomadic \npopulations, social and domestic units are highly fluid and shift seasonally, and the \nproximity of extra-household networks also shifts geographically, with important \nimplications for the way women are able to manage illness episodes. \n \nAt certain times of year, when large of numbers of people are closely grouped together, \nwomen may have reasonably good access to large networks of extra-household kin.  At other \ntimes of year, when people are widely dispersed, access to these networks is limited, with \nimportant implications for illness management.  The example of Rabiatou, the young Fulani \nwoman suffering from naora redu and jonte is pertinent here.  Unable to disclose her illness \nand seek help from her husband, the only person to whom she felt able to turn was her \nmother.  Rabiatou\u2019s mother was part of a nomadic herding unit, and at the time of the study, \nshe was far away to the east on transhumance.  Only in the harvest season, two months away, \nwould their paths cross.  Rabiatou was waiting for this opportunity to seek help through her \n 28\nmother.  Likewise, a very young Arab women suffering from ouaram was too shy to bring \nher condition to the attention of her husband or mother-in-law.  Her own kin were far away \nnear Massagu\u00e8t at the time of interview, and she was waiting until later in the rainy season, \nwhen they would all be grouped together further north. \n \nAt certain times of year, as well as general dispersion, herding and domestic units may \ndivide, to allow different herding (and agricultural) strategies to be pursued simultaneously.  \nIn particular, young men sometimes go off separately with some of the herds.  At such times, \nthe access that women have to members of their immediate domestic units (husbands for \nyounger women, sons for older women) becomes limited.  In cases where a young woman\u2019s \nhusband is away on transhumance, her husband\u2019s father and brothers are charged with the \nresponsibility for her health needs.  Several young women, though, claimed that their other \nin-laws did not have the same interest in them as their husbands did.  One Goran woman was \nsuffering with ouarama at the time of the interview, but her husband was away with the \ncattle, so she said she would have to rely on cow oil and cow\u2019s urine until his return.  A \nsimilar case was reported by a junior co-wife in a large extended household.  During the hot \ndry season her husband had been away herding cattle, and she had not felt able to mention \nher ouarama to her other affines. \n \nAnother consequence of mobility and fluidity of domestic units is that co-wives may live, for \nlarge parts of the year, in separate units, with the husband spending several weeks at a time \nwith each in turn, thus leaving each wife temporarily husbandless in the meantime.  Another \nGoran woman reported a case of rourou lintr\u00e9 (literally \u201cplacenta undressed\u201d, referring to a \nvery serious  condition thought to be caused by part of the placenta failing to come out at \nchildbirth).  The condition became very painful a year after the birth of a child, while her \nhusband was staying with his other wife, some distance away.  A wandering Dr. Choukou \n 29\noffered to treat her condition but, in her husband\u2019s absence, she did not have the financial \nmeans necessary.  Although she was staying with her husband\u2019s brothers\u2019 sons, she did not \nfeel able to approach them for money, particularly due to the embarrassing nature of her \ncondition. \n \nSo spatial mobility and dispersion can be problematic for nomadic women during times of \nill-health, not only (or even mainly) because of the well-documented, physical problems of \naccess, but because of the implications for accessing social and kin networks at different \ntimes of year.  For women with multiple networks, the situation is less critical.  When \nHalima\u2019s husband was away on transhumance, she still had her mother, father and brother \naround to take care of her.  But for women whose networks are already limited, seasonal \ndispersion of networks might exacerbate an already vulnerable position. \n \nHowever, it is also possible to turn the argument on its head, and suggest that mobility can \nbe advantageous in that it brings people together as well as separating them.  In Rabiatou\u2019s \ncase, she was expecting to have to wait for another two months before she would have access \nto her mother and thus possibly to help.  However, a comparable (non close kin) marriage in \na purely sedentary context might have meant that she was separated from her mother on a \nmuch more permanent basis.  At the height of the rainy season, many hundreds of herding \nArab farriqs, all khashmalbet (people of the same large family) are grouped together far \nnorth, giving people the chance to access a much wider range of kin than would probably be \nthe case in a sedentary setting.  As well as increasing the potential geographical range of the \nhealth service resource base, mobility might also, therefore, have the advantage of increasing \nthe social resource base which can be mobilised to deal with health problems, at least at \ncertain times of year. \n 30\nConclusions \nGender and seasonal mobility interact in complex ways which influence profoundly the \naccess that nomadic women in Chad have to various health resources: information, treatment \nand care.  Health resources are strongly gendered.  Home remedies, caring and supportive \nroles, and the treatment of certain reproductive health problems fall within the female \ndomain.  But access to most other health practitioners, treatments and knowledge, \nparticularly those of high status, is controlled largely by men.   \n \nFor a pastoralist woman, the actions taken during an illness episode, and the outcome, are \ndependent to a great degree on the nature and quality of her social support systems, and on \nher ability to mobilise them adequately, in relation to her health needs.  These support \nsystems include: husband and other affines, male kin and networks of female kin and friends.  \nAs other studies elsewhere have shown, these vary considerably between women as a \nfunction of: life cycle, success in bearing and rearing children, marital status (including \nwhether the marriage is polygamous or monogamous, and between close kin or not) and the \nstructure of domestic units within which women find themselves, often temporarily. \n \nProblems faced by nomadic groups in accessing health resources are often framed primarily \nin terms of their spatial mobility and geographical dispersion.  While these factors are \ndoubtless significant in Chad, it is clear that these are not the only, or even the most \nimportant, barriers faced by nomadic women.  The case of the Fulani suggests that settling \nper se does not necessarily improve access to health resources, at least in the short term.  Far \nmore enduring are the social, economic and cultural barriers.  However, spatial mobility and \ndispersion are important in the ways in which they interact with and shape these other \nbarriers.  Mobility and fluidity of social and domestic organisation mean that the access that \nwomen have to kin and social networks changes substantially over the course of a year.  \n 31\nWomen who enjoy access to multiple networks are to some extent buffered against these \nseasonal shifts; most vulnerable are the women whose networks are already limited. \n \nThis study has important implications for other researchers and policy-makers interested in \nhealth provision for mobile populations.  In terms of health policy and practice, it is clear \nthat dealing purely with the issues of mobility (eg. setting up mobile clinics, or encouraging \nthe settlement of nomadic populations) will not necessarily result in improved access to \nhealth services for pastoralist women.  It is necessary also to understand the social context of \ncontrol and distribution of health resources.  In terms of other research, it is clear that \nanalyses which present a static view of the role of social structures and networks in the \ndistribution of health resources are likely to be inadequate and misleading where those \nnetworks are shifting.  This is pertinent not only to nomadic pastoralists but to other mobile \ngroups like seasonal labour migrants or refugees.  In the case of Chad, further, longer term \nwork is needed to elucidate more fully the ways in which women\u2019s social networks, \nparticularly the less visible female networks, change over the course of a year and exactly \nhow these impinge on illness management. \nNotes \n1.
