For example, in the mountains of \nnorthern Thailand, environmental risk is defined in terms of soil erosion and its \npotential impact on watershed properties. As a result, government policies seek to \ncontrol erosion by restricting upland agriculture, relocating villages from the uplands, \nor covering large areas of land with teak and pine plantations. \n This approach to environmental risk, however, is now increasingly challenged \n(Lash et al, 1996; Wisner et al, 2004). A growing number of researchers are instead \n 1\nurging that environmental risk should be seen more contextually, and less on the \nbasis of universal assumptions about biophysical causes of risk. Yet, despite much \ndiscussion about the need for alternative approaches, researchers are still uncertain \nabout how to implement policies that do not adopt universal approaches to \nenvironmental risk.  \n This paper considers the ways in which Sustainable Livelihoods Approaches \n(SLAs) to development may be used for this purpose. SLAs have been adopted by \ndevelopment agencies since the 1990s as a way to reduce vulnerability and poverty \nthrough means such as income diversification and agricultural intensification \n(Scoones, 1998; Carney, 2003). Influenced by scholars such as Robert Chambers \nand Amartya Sen, SLAs aim to strengthen local resilience by enhancing institutions \ngoverning access to livelihoods and resources. Some analysts have claimed SLAs \nmay allow poor people to adapt to, or reduce, environmental degradation by aligning \nenvironmental policy more with local environmental perceptions and vulnerability. \nBut, some critics claim more work is required to make SLAs effective for governance \n(Arce, 2003), and their implications for governing environmental risks can be \ndeveloped further.  \n The paper explores the potential use of SLAs in less universalistic environmental \npolicy by considering soil erosion in the uplands of northern Thailand. \n \n \nNorthern Thailand and approaches to soil erosion \nThe highlands of northern Thailandi commonly inspire images of teak forests, \nBuddhist temples, lush green rice fields and remote hillside villages inhabited by \ncolorful \u2018hill tribes.\u2019 Although the region is by no means as high as the snow-capped \nHimalayan ranges further west (northern Thailand\u2019s highest peak, Doi Inthanon, is \njust 2,565 meters above sea level), the region is the most consistently mountainous \nregion of Thailand. It is also the most remote region, with many valleys and hillsides \nunconnected to transport routes, and was only politically integrated into the rest of \nThailand in the twentieth century.  \n Classically, the region of northern Thailand has contained two main ethnic \ngroups: the lowland Thai (khonmuang), who traditionally inhabited irrigated \nintermontane basins; and upland minorities (so-called \u2018hill tribes\u2019 or chao khao), who \nhistorically practiced forms of shifting cultivation in the uplands. Upland minorities \nhave also been divided into ethnic groups who have either lived in Thailand for as \nlong as the lowland Thai (such as the Karen), and those who have migrated to \nThailand from neighboring Burma, Laos and China during the twentieth century, and \nwho typically cultivated opium. Some early studies of shifting cultivation in the region \nclassified these groups into those using so-called \u2018pioneer\u2019 forms of shifting \ncultivation, such as the Hmong, Mien and Akha (who relocated villages every 10-20 \nyears in search of more land); and \u2018rotational\u2019 cultivators, such as the Karen (who \nrotated agricultural plots around semi-permanent settlements) (Grandstaff, 1980). In \nrecent decades, however, these distinctions have become blurred as both Thai and \nminorities inhabit the uplands, and forms of shifting cultivation have been replaced by \nmore permanent and commercialized agriculture. \n Both historic and current forms of upland cultivation have been blamed for \ncausing environmental degradation, and particularly erosion. These views have had \nlong pedigrees. The British colonial scientist, O.H.K. Spate (1945), writing about \ncomparable areas in Burma, commented: \u2018naturally, these practices are attended \nwith serious deforestation and soil erosion.\u2019 More recently, permanent agriculture has \nalso been blamed for erosion as it reduces fallow periods and increases the intensity \nof land use. Some observers also fear that historic \u2018pioneer\u2019 shifting cultivators may \nnot understand the potential long-term impacts of permanent agriculture. In 1987, the \nBangkok think-tank, Thailand Development Research Institute (1987, p. 296) wrote: \n \n 2\nWhereas slash and burn agriculture was once more closely attuned with \nthe ecosystems exploited, it now causes untold ecological damages \u2026 In \nthe process, major watersheds are being denuded, with increasing silt \nloads washed down into the nation\u2019s rivers [and] silting up dams. \n \nDeforestation is blamed for erosion for it reduces the canopy cover of soil, and \nfrequently removes trees from the ground, and disturbs soil. Cultivation also takes \nplace on steep slopes, which encourages erosion. Sediment from the hills is also \nblamed for silting up lowland dams and rivers. Erosion of soil is also considered to \nreduce its water-holding properties, which is seen to exacerbate lowland water \nshortages. \n Critics have also claimed opium-substitution policies cause environmental \ndegradation. During the 1980s, various development agencies sought to replace \nopium cultivation with alternative, cash-based export crops such as cabbages, soya \nbeans and strawberries. These crops have been criticized for either exposing too \nmuch upland land to rainfall and for providing too little binding of upland soils. \nMoreover, some NGO workers have also considered that attempts to integrate \nupland minorities within wider commercial networks may destabilize historic balances \nbetween farmers and the fragile upland environment. One upland-NGO worker \nwrote: \n \nTraditionally, the hill tribes used slash and burn tactics in a limited way \u2013 \njust to produce food for their families. But in trying to produce cash crops \nand satisfy the demands of the market, the tribes surpassed the natural \ncapacities of the land, degraded by deforestation and erosion (Tuenjai, \n2000, p. 1). \n \nAnd some environmental NGOs have been even more explicit about the threat of \nerosion that may result from upland agriculture: \n \nHeavy rains wash away the soil, which quickly silts up dams, reservoirs \nand rivers. ... Every rainy season now, lowland paddies are buried under \n2-3 meters of sand. \u2026 The evergreen headwater forest should be areas of \nstrict conservation as their removal brings about environmental disaster \n(Svasti, 1998). \n \n Consequently, various government and NGO initiatives have sought to enforce \nenvironmental policies that reduce agricultural pressure on upland soils. Policies \ninclude relocating villages from locations considered especially fragile for soil \nerosion; placing restrictions on cultivation on steep slopes; and reforesting large \nareas of land with teak and pine plantations. Plantations are claimed to help reduce \nerosion by protecting soil surfaces, and by reducing the need for upland agriculture \nby offering livelihoods in maintaining plantations instead. Grass strips on steep \nslopes have also been used, which aim to prevent erosion by reducing the length of \nthe slope (and hence the ability for water on slopes to gather speed). Most \nsignificantly, large areas of northern Thailand are now under various categories of \nprotected land such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, which restrict \nagriculture. Currently, about 50 percent of the total northern region is classified as \nconservation forest. In some highly forested provinces such as Nan, conservation \nforest covers 80 percent of the provincial area (Ewers, 2003). \n \n \nQuestioning these concerns \nYet, these worries about soil erosion in northern Thailand may also be criticized for \nvarious reasons. \n 3\n First, much research has questioned the assumptions made about causes and \neffects of erosion in Thailand. For example, research in the similar topography of the \nMiddle Hills of Nepal has indicated that popular debates overlook the immense \nvariation in environmental processes across time and space, and the role of non-\nanthropogenic causes of erosion such as monsoon rainfall and tectonic uplift (Ives \nand Messerli, 1989; Ives, 2004). In particular, many deep gullies that dissect upland \nareas may be naturally occurring (Smadje, 1992:7). Other hydrological research \nelsewhere has questioned how far land-cover changes such as deforestation are \nnecessarily linked to water shortages. Indeed, planting large-scale tree plantations \nmay even decrease lowland supplies of water (Calder, 1999; Bruijnzeel, 2004). \n A related finding is that estimates of soil erosion coming from the Universal Soil \nLoss Equation (USLE) (adopted as a guide in the USA after the so-called \u2018Dust Bowl\u2019 \ncrisis of the 1930s) may be overstated in tropical regions (Hallsworth, 1987). \nResearch has suggested that the USLE may simplify factors such as rainfall intensity \n(particularly the influence of storms) or the length of slopes, where farming practices \nprovide breaks in slopes. Moreover, the USLE may focus too exclusively on erosion \nrather than on declining soil fertility caused by exhaustion of nutrients. In northern \nThailand, slopes are frequently divided into complex household plots, and rainfall \nfalls mainly between June and October, often in storms. In one study, Thitirojanawat \nand Chareonsuk (2000) found that the USLE predicted rates of soil loss in Nan \nprovince 104 times greater than those actually observed in run-off plots! \n Second, research has also suggested that many farmers may mitigate \nenvironmental change by careful practices of adaptation. For example, classic \nresearch on shifting cultivation has argued that farmers are more skilled in managing \nspecies diversity and soil fertility than commonly thought (Conklin, 1954). Research \nhas also questioned the relationship of upland cultivation and erosion. In Nepal\u2019s \nMiddle Hills, anthropologists found that some hill farmers actually use landslides \nopportunistically to assist in the creation of terraced land, and that landslides may \nrenew soil fertility by turning over soil (Kienholz et al, 1984; Ives and Messerli, \n1989:90). Perhaps most famously, Tiffen and Mortimore\u2019s (1994) study in Machakos, \nKenya, demonstrated that \u2018more people\u2019 could mean \u2018less erosion\u2019 if farmers were \nable to build terraces, instigate soil conservation, and identify opportunities for trade \nand income diversification. \n And thirdly, some analysts have argued controversially that fixed visions of \nenvironmental risk, such as those concerning soil erosion in northern Thailand, \nshould be understood politically as attempts to legitimize state interventions and \nsystems of control (Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987). Sociologists of scientific knowledge \nhave given the name \u2018environmental narratives\u2019 to some fixed notions concerning \nenvironmental risks, to indicate how very simple cause-and-effect stories have \nbecome accepted as incontestable, when in fact they are less certain than assumed. \n\u2018Crisis narratives,\u2019 Roe (1995, p. 1066) argued, \u2018are the primary means whereby \ndevelopment experts and the institutions for which they work claim rights to \nstewardship over land and resources they do not own.\u2019 And Hajer (1995, pp. 64-65) \nwrote: \u2018Storylines [or narratives] are devices through which actors are positioned, \nand through which specific ideas of \u201cblame\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201durgency\u201d and \n\u201cresponsible behaviour\u201d are attributed\u2019. \n Consequently, analysts have argued that many fixed beliefs about the cause and \neffect of environmental problems serve political purposes in enforcing notions of \nsocial order or political authority that may not be as easy to achieve without these \nvisions of risk. \n How do these fixed visions of risk, or environmental narratives, occur? Scholars \nhave argued that narratives \u2018stabilize\u2019 complex and uncertain biophysical events or \nchange processes, in order to offer a managerially convenient summary of cause \nand effect. For example, in Guinea in West Africa, Fairhead and Leach (1996) \nargued that the state has blamed smallholder agriculturalists for deforestation \n 4\nbecause it believes population growth and inappropriate agriculture have contributed \nto the decline in forest areas. However, research that Fairhead and Leach \nsummarize has shown that villagers have actually contributed to the conservation of \nforest areas, and that divisions between closed and savanna forest are complex and \nvariable. Yet, as a result of the narrative, the government of Guinea has been able to \ndefend a centralized approach to environmental policymaking, and instigate various \nrestrictions on agriculture in rural areas. \n One important concept in creating environmental narratives is \u2018problem closure,\u2019 \nwhich is when one specific definition of a problem is used to frame subsequent \ngeneration of knowledge about environmental causes and effects (Hajer 1995, p. \n22). Problem closure also reflects dominant patterns in society and politics, as well \nas the definition of technical expertise and who is allowed to participate in scientific \ndiscussion. Listening to alternative social needs, or diversifying the definition of \nexpertise might therefore produce alternative forms of knowledge. In northern \nThailand, the historic divisions between \u2018uplanders\u2019 and \u2018lowlanders,\u2019 or ethnic \nminorities and Thais, as well as the desire of the state to bring this region under \ngreater political control, seem prime ground for environmental narratives to emerge. \n These various concerns have led analysts to argue that approaches to \nenvironmental risk should not be based on universal and predefined notions of cause \nand effect, but instead should be defined more flexibly, case by case. It is important \nto ask how far environmental changes present problems for different people; how far \npeople are able to adapt to changes; and how far the definition of risk itself may \naffect their own political and socio-economic status. But at the same time, there is \nstill uncertainty about how to integrate these concerns into an alternative form of \nenvironmental policy that can avoid the problems of oversimple standardized \nnarratives.  \n In particular, it is not clear if more flexible approaches to environmental risk imply \nthe need for greater adaptations to known risks, or the need to redefine the nature of \nrisk in a more fundamental way. For example, Tiffen and Mortimore\u2019s work assumes \nthat erosion is still a problem, even if people can adapt to, or avoid, it. In contrast, \nresearch in the Himalayas has suggested that erosion is not necessarily the chief \ncause of degradation, and that declining soil fertility, or overall lack of productive \nland, is a more accurate indication of what restricts livelihoods (Ives, 2004). \nConsequently, should alternative approaches to environmental policy still mean \nbuilding institutions against predefined risks, or instead allow local people to \nreformulate the perception of risks? \n One possible route for more flexible approaches to environmental risk lies \nthrough Sustainable Livelihoods Approaches (SLAs). \n \n \nSustainable Livelihoods and environmental risk \n \nSustainable Livelihoods Approaches (SLAs) within development studies are \ngenerally traced to the work of Robert Chambers and Gordon Conway (1992), who \nargued that one can reduce poverty and vulnerability by increasing livelihood options \nespecially during times of economic or environmental stress. They wrote: \n \n[a sustainable livelihood] can cope with and recover from stress and shocks, \nmaintain and enhance its capabilities and assets and provide sustainable \nlivelihood opportunities for the next generation; [it] contributes net benefits to \nother livelihoods at the local and global level and in the short and long term \n(Chambers and Conway, 1992:1). \n \n This and later discussions of SLAs have also been influenced by Amartya Sen\u2019s \nconcepts of endowments, entitlements and capabilities, which discuss how poor \n 5\npeople can access resources and livelihood options (Scoones, 1998; Carney, 2003). \nEndowments (and the related term of assets) cover a variety of types of resources \n(tangible and intangible notably including institutional arrangements) that may allow \nindividuals to achieve livelihoods and their chosen potential, Capabilities are the \nrange of valued life-options (including life-paths over time) that people can attain \n(Alkire, 2002). SLAs seek to make institutional arrangements that guarantee a range \nof livelihood options, which can reduce the vulnerability and poverty of individuals. \nThe term, \u2018sustainable\u2019 refers to different aspects of longevity: economic, institutional, \nsocial and environmental (Carney, 2003, p. 27).  \n SLAs may be described in various forms, but some authors have argued that the \nessence of SLAs should be to flexible, and avoid having specific institutional designs \nthat may restrict local determination of assets and capabilities (Ellis, 2000; \nHinshelwood, 2003). Figure 1 shows one diagrammatic representation of SLA, which \navoids having predefined lines of activity between local development problems (the \nvulnerability context), state-based policy contexts, and the middle-level development \ninterventions that affect assets, activities and outcomes. \n \n[take in Figure 1 here] \n \n \n \nFigure 1: The Basic Sustainable Livelihoods Framework \n \n \nVULNERABILITY CONTEXT\ntrendsseasonalityshocks\nASSETS ACTIVITIES OUTCOMES\nPOLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT\nlaws & rightsgovernment democracy\n \n \nSource: adapted from Scoones (1998), Ellis (2000) \n \n \n Self-determination of livelihoods and risks is a further key feature of SLA. \nProponents hold that: \n \nPoor people themselves must be key actors in identifying and addressing \nlivelihood priorities. Outsiders need processes that enable them to listen \nand respond to the poor (Ashley and Carney, 1999, p. 7). \nand \nSustainable livelihood approaches call for constant questioning of common \nassumptions and repeated reference to the effects of policy and actions on \nthe livelihoods of the poor (Carney, 2003, p. 32). \n \n 6\n Consequently, SLAs may be compatible with non-universal notions of \nenvironmental risk because they allow poor people to define risks as they perceive \nthem. In effect, this means the problem closure of environmental interventions is \nderived from the perceptions of local vulnerability by poor people, rather than on the \nbasis of predefined narratives about cause and effect. \n \n This specific use of SLAs for local determination of risks has not always been \nmade explicit in some adaptations of SLAs by development agencies and research \ninstitutes since the late 1990s (such as, for example the UK\u2019s Department for \nInternational Development, DFID). These uses of SLAs have instead developed \nthree themes that may assist in social and economic access to livelihoods. SLAs \nhave now generally focused upon furnishing different types of \u2018capital\u2019 as resources \nfor livelihoods. Usually five capitals are identified: natural (natural resources), \nphysical (infrastructure, technology); financial (loans); human (personnel and \ntraining); and social (social cohesiveness). Second, livelihood strategies have been \ndefined as agricultural intensification or extensification, livelihood diversification, and \nlimited forms of migration. And thirdly, the ability to achieve or access these \nlivelihoods have been seen as determined by a range of formal and informal \norganizational and institutional factors that influence sustainable livelihood outcomes \n(Scoones, 1998; Bebbington, 1999). Indeed, these three themes have been used as \npart of a tentative institutional design of the SLA that is transferable between \ncontexts. \n Despite these advances, some critics have claimed SLAs are still insufficiently \ndeveloped in political terms, or as tools of local governance. Some have suggested \nthat SLAs should be reformulated as rights-based approaches in development, \nwhere participation is defined as the right to assert needs, rather than a \u2018sham \nparticipation\u2019 in policymaking by poor people (Baumann, 2000, p. 34; Carney, 2003). \nAt another level, others have claimed that an emphasis on institutional design and \ndiverse \u2018capitals\u2019 (such as natural, social, etc.) has made SLA \u2018merely a confused \ndiagram and a wordy manual\u2019 and that we should instead realize \u2018community work is \nnot easily captured in a diagram\u2019 (Hinselwood, 2003, pp. 254, 243). This kind of \nargument underlies the desire to have flexibility in how SLAs are designed and \ndescribed (as in Figure 1). Moreover, Arce (2003, p. 204) has argued that using \nwords such as \u2018capitals\u2019 in uncritical, easily transferred, ways may reduce the ability \nfor local people to assert their own values in framing development policy.  \n In environmental terms too, there are questions about how SLA is applied. On \none hand, some analysts have agreed that SLA implies a more livelihoods-focused \napproach for defining risk and resources. According to Scoones (1998, pp. 6-7), \n \nNatural resource base sustainability refers to the ability of a system to maintain \nproductivity when subject to disturbing forces\u2026 This implies avoiding depleting \nstocks of natural resources to a level which results in an effectively permanent \ndecline in the rate at which the natural resource base yields useful products or \nservices for livelihoods. \n \nIn addition, DFID (2002) has argued that SLA can challenge some key environmental \nnarratives that poor people cause or cannot adapt to environmental degradation. \nThis approach fully adopts the new problem closure offered under SLAs because it \nallows poor people to define both environmental problems and sustainable \ndevelopment because they are linked to activities that may reduce their vulnerability \nand secure sustainable livelihoods. This approach therefore gives precedence to \npoor people\u2019s definitions and uses of natural resources as a way to reduce \nvulnerability, rather than necessarily allow resources or environmental problems to \nbe defined by other means.  \n  \n 7\n In contrast, some environmental applications of SLAs have still adopted \npredefined definitions of risk, and instead have seen SLAs as ways to encourage \nlocal institutional adaptations to these risks. For example, writing about SLA and \nenvironmental science, Ashby (2003, p. 2) wrote: \u2018A reversal of environmental \ndegradation requires new livelihood options that change people\u2019s incentives, in \nparticular, the benefits and costs of resource use.\u2019  This approach suggests that \nlivelihood activities should be seen as operating in response to known risks and \nknown potential damage to resources, rather than as redefining these risks or \nvaluations of resources from the perspective of reducing local poverty and \nvulnerability. Similarly, a report from the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture \nOrganization has discussed SLA as a form of local institution that exists alongside \nmethods of environmental protection, rather than as also a form of environmental \nprotection itself. The report wrote: \n \nAn environmentally protected area, such as a park or game reserve, represents a \nparticular type of local institution that could link with the livelihoods of people \nliving in the area in several ways\u2026 Successful conservation of wild animals \nwithin the area might increase the vulnerability of people living outside by having \ntheir crops destroyed or their lives threatened. On the other hand, in the longer \nterm it may reduce people\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters like drought or \nflooding by protecting watersheds, wetlands and local microclimates\u2026 (Messer \nand Townsley, 2003, pp. 16-7). \n \nSuch statements overlook the epistemological potential of SLAs by defining both the \nrisks and the institutions in terms of outsiders, rather than acknowledging how the \ndefinition of livelihood strategies and risks are linked by poor people. Moreover, this \nstatement adopts cause and effect statements about watershed and climate \nprotection that may reflect simplistic environmental narratives. In this case, it seems \nthat discussion of SLAs has been added on top of pre-existing notions of \nenvironmental risk, rather than being a way to specify this risk using the perspectives \nof vulnerable people. \n SLAs therefore have been proposed as ways to build institutions around poor \npeople\u2019s perceptions of resources and vulnerability. Critics have suggested that \nSLAs may still be dominated by outsiders\u2019 priorities for policy. Moreover, the link with \nenvironmental risks may still be developed further. The following example from \nThailand tries to indicate how far SLAs can enable a more locally determined \napproach to defining environmental risk. \n \n \nExample: soil erosion and livelihoods in northern Thailand  \nThe topic of sustainable livelihoods has been researched to a limited extent in \nThailand (Parnwell, 2005), but these studies have not focused on SLAs\u2019 role in \nenvironmental analysis. Various other development interventions have adopted \ninsights from SLAs, even if they have not formally claimed this. The following \nexamples of research on erosion and livelihoods indicate possibilities for integrating \nSLAs with non-universalistic approaches to environmental risk. \n The first study is based on research by the author (Forsyth, 1996, updated by \nfieldwork, 2004-5) on land cultivated by the Mien ethnic group.ii The Mien were \ntraditional \u2018pioneer\u2019 shifting cultivators, who have learned to adopt permanent and \ncommercialized agriculture since their arrival at this site in 1947. The population has \ngrown from 110 in 1947 to about 1,200 in 2005. Historically, the staple crops of the \nMien were rice, maize and opium. Since the 1980s, opium cultivation has been \nabandoned, and farmers have also cultivated soybeans, ginger and peanuts, with \nlimited amounts of coffee, oranges and lychee. \n 8\n This study asked how farmers responded to soil degradation, including its impact \non livelihoods. Historic aerial photographs, land surveys and a Geographical \nInformation System (GIS) were used to identify how far land use had been \nconcentrated on steep slopes.iii These categories were then physically measured \nfor erosion in order to to indicate the range of historic soil erosion that had occurred \nin this region.iv Farmers were then interviewed about their perceptions of soil \ndegradation and its impacts on decisions about livelihoods. \n The study yielded various findings. First, the GIS map and interviews with \nvillagers indicated that farmers were aware that steeper slopes generated more \nerosion, and that this was considered responsible for declining soil fertility in these \nregions. Yet, consequently, farmers had used less steep land more frequently, which \ngenerated less erosion, but which was more likely to experience exhaustion of soil \nnutrients. Consequently, erosion was indeed considered a risk, but farmers tried to \navoid it, and this was shown by the \u2018most eroded\u2019 category of land being just 5 \npercent of the total study area. The physical measurements of erosion indicated \nrates of 24 and 64 tons per hectare per year 1963 -1991 for the \u2018least\u2019 and \u2018most\u2019 \neroded categories of land respectively. The higher of these rates is indeed \nconsidered high in Thailand and elsewhere (e.g. Nipon, 1991), but the role of \nagriculture in generating these levels may be relatively low because farmers avoid \nthese slopes. \n Second, gullies in this area of Thailand may result from naturally occurring \nweathering of granite, rather than from agricultural practices. The GIS data indicated \na marked absence of relatively gentle slopes of between 10 and 20 percent, which \nwas apparent in the landscape which consisted of hummocky, rounded land, and \ngullies of some 1-2 meters depth in-between. This has been described as an \u2018all-\nslopes-topography,\u2019 which is found on granite land in other locations (such as Brazil, \nsee Twidale 1982, p. 177). Furthermore, villagers explained that these gullies existed \nbefore the establishment of the village; that they occurred on both forested and \nagricultural land; and that villagers preferred to keep them vegetated in order to \nharvest plants. These gullies may therefore be non-agricultural contributors to upland \nerosion and lowland sedimentation. \n And thirdly, farmers explained that \u2013 despite their attempts to avoid erosion \u2013 soil \nfertility was declining, and that inorganic fertilizer was now considered necessary. \nIndeed, surveys indicate that fertilizer use has growth from just 5 percent of \nhouseholds to 100 percent between 1991 and 2005. Detailed discussions also \nrevealed that farmers had adopted a new system of local land tenure during the early \n1970s (after some 25 years of settlement), which allocated land to specific \nhouseholds and families (earlier there had been an open-access system). This new \nsystem of land tenure encouraged farmers to cultivate land continuously in order to \ndemonstrate that they intended to keep the land, an innovation that they hoped \nwould enhance their formal tenure security. Moreover, the proportion of household \nmembers working in cities, or engaging in circular migration to earn remittances was \nincreasing. \n The second study was conducted by Turkelboom (1999) among the Akha \npeople, some 15km from the Mien site, at Pakha in Chiang Rai province.v The Akha \nare also historically \u2018pioneer\u2019 cultivators, although this village was established in \n1976. Farmers cultivate irrigated and rain-fed rice, as well as cabbage, beans and \ntree crops. The study used a combination of experimental plots, erosion surveys and \nparticipatory discussions with farmers. The study asked how farmers were \nresponding to erosion and land shortage, and how these impacted on livelihoods. \n First, the study found that agriculture was indeed increasing erosion. Tillage \nerosion was apparent because farmers experienced declining soil fertility at the top \nof steep slopes, in locations where water erosion was less likely to occur because of \nthe comparative lack of slope length. Gully erosion was also evident. This village \n 9\nalso had deep, naturally occurring gullies between convex slopes. But there were \nalso smaller gullies on agricultural land that did not occur under forest cover, of some \n10 to 15 centimeters in depth. These gullies apparently resulted from overland flow \ngenerated during rainfall on steep slopes, or when water ran onto slopes from other \nsources, such as from roads. Sometimes landslips occurred when streams or paths \nundercut slopes. The erosion on slopes, however, was also found to increase soil \nfertility when soil was deposited on lower slopes, around lines of crops, or on leveled \nland. Yet, despite this erosion, it seemed clear that erosion on slopes did not lead to \nlowland sedimentation because only a third of agricultural slopes fed stream \nnetworks (and thus deposited soil would remain in place). Moreover, soil was \ndeposited on slopes as steep as 60 percent, and hence steep slopes need not \nalways generate net outflows of sediment. \n Second, however, farmers were aware of these problems and adopted various \nmethods of soil conservation. Mulching reduced the impacts of erosion during the \nearly weeks of cultivation of some crops such as ginger. Diversion channels \u2013 or \nsmall trenches 10 to 20 centimeters deep \u2013 were drawn across fields to reduce water \nflow, and to demarcate field ownership. Tree crops on slopes were also increasing, \npartly because some farmers saw them as a more reliable source of income. Yet, \nfarmers agreed soil fertility was declining. Some elders liked to tell the mythological \nstory of a giant, underground snake or pig-like monster (\u2018pjengcha\u2019) that caused \nlandslips and political havoc every 13 years. Others reported \u2018you can see the bones \nthrough the soil now\u2019 or that \u2018the land is becoming like old people\u2014they are not \nstrong enough to hold anything anymore\u2019 (Turkelboom 1999, pp. 172, 190). \n Thirdly, erosion arising from new commercial crops was not as bad as \nsuggested. Rain-fed rice (the most \u2018traditional\u2019 Akha crop) had the highest rates of \nerosion: 60 tons per hectare per crop cycle. Maize and beans were least erosive with \nmedian soil losses of respectively 19 and 10 tons per hectare per crop cycle. Erosion \nin cabbage fields lay in between these two extremes. Importantly, this study \nmeasured erosion under cropping systems (with reference to the timing and manner \nof cultivation) rather than according to crops or slopes alone. Consequently, the \nmonths when cabbage had only a small surface area were generally during the dry \nseason, when rainfall erosion was least. Moreover, if the price of cabbage fell, \nfarmers would abandon fields, allowing them to be invaded by grass and hence be \nfurther protected against erosion. \n Yet, perhaps most importantly, this study also showed it is important not to \ngeneralize about farmers. Turkelboom (1999, pp. 208-211) identified five levels of \nentrepreneurialism or concern for soil conservation: secure investors (who owned \npaddy fields and fruit plantations); profit maximizers (adopting high-risk crops such \nas cabbage); diversifiers (farmers who mix rice cultivation with limited cash crops); \nsurvivors (those who cultivated only rice on a short-term basis); and dropouts (who \nrelied solely on wage labour and petty business). The survivors accounted for some \n30 percent of the village. The point of this classification is to acknowledge soil and \ncrop management does not take place uniformly across single ethnic groups, but that \nthere is great diversity between and within households. \n \n \nImplications for sustainable livelihood approaches \nThese two studies are relevant to sustainable livelihoods approaches (SLAs) \nbecause they concern the nature and response to environmental risks by poor \npeople. They add to the debate about SLAs because they do not just demonstrate \nhow villagers are adopting strategies such as agricultural intensification, economic \ndiversification and limited migration. Instead, they also show that the very definition \nof SLAs, as responses to periods of environmental or economic stress, cannot be \nseparated from the definitions of those risks. Three factors appear significant. \n 10\n First, despite the common beliefs that upland agriculture is a cause of erosion, \nand that environmental policies should control erosion directly, the studies \ndemonstrate that assumptions about erosion are clearly simplistic. Erosion and \nsedimentation are not only caused by agricultural practices but by various non-\nanthropogenic causes such as gullies; the topography of stream networks is \nimportant; and other factors such as the location and influence of roads on water and \nsoil flows have to be acknowledged. Crop cycles, or the timing and management of \ndifferent crops may also mitigate their impacts on erosion. Moreover, erosion need \nnot represent the most important cause of soil degradation for upland farmers \nthemselves, as declining soil fertility through repeated cultivation may be more \nsignificant. Indeed, local perceptions and responses to soil problems partly ensure \nthat erosion is not as damaging as it might be. Consequently, the organizing vision \nfor SLAs \u2013 or underlying problem closure \u2013 should clearly not be the belief that \nupland agriculture is causing erosion, and that stopping this erosion will prevent \nlowland sedimentation or upland declining soil fertility. \n Second, soil erosion is clearly only part of the causes of risks to individual \nhouseholds. Households have different vulnerabilities, according to access to land, \navailability of labor to diversify into different economic activities, and in levels of \nentrepreneurialism. Erosion, or soil degradation in general, clearly affects most \nfarmers in both studies, but the impact on overall household vulnerability is highly \nvariable. Consequently, we should perhaps not ask whether \u2018erosion\u2019 is the \nappropriately predefined risk, but the extent to which erosion is potentially a risk \nbecause of the overall exposure of people to erosion. If the contribution of upland \nagriculture to erosion is not as high as thought, then perhaps it may be acceptable \nfor farmers to achieve livelihoods through repeated cultivation if this is also \nconducted with the use of fertilizers and achieving income through supplementary \nsources.vi In this sense, therefore, we should not ask whether erosion is a predefined \nrisk, but we should consider how far it might be a risk if resources of adaptation are \nnot available. However, we can conclude that land shortage and declining \nagricultural productivity (if it occurs) are more certain risks for upland farmers, to \nwhich erosion may or may not contribute. \n And thirdly, it is clear that some of the interventions proposed by environmental \npolicies may actually significantly work against SLAs. Most directly, this may be \ncaused by the removal of agricultural land through tree plantations. These studies \ntherefore indicate that SLAs need to have local fora in which these dominant \ndefinitions of risk (or problem closures) can be challenged. To date, most \ndiscussions of SLAs have not really defined the settings in which livelihoods and \nenvironmental problems are defined, and some discussions of SLAs (such as those \nundertaken by Ashley and Messer and Townsley above) aim to place livelihood \nstrategies within predefined environmental objectives. If SLAs are to emphasize the \nneeds and perceptions of vulnerable poor people, then there needs to be more \nattention to how (and who)_defines environmental risks. In effect, this means \nensuring that the assets and capabilities implied in a Sen-ian SLAs also imply rights \nover defining the objectives of sustainable livelihoods, and not allowing others to \ndefine these to the detriment of local people\u2019s livelihood opportunities. \n \n \nConclusion: deepening the impacts of Sustainable Livelihoods Approaches \nThis paper has summarized debates about sustainable livelihoods approaches \n(SLAs) as a potential way to avoid fixed and universalistic attitudes to environmental \nrisk. It illustrated this challenge with examples of research in the uplands of northern \nThailand, and the disputed belief that environmental policy should focus on mitigating \nsoil erosion. The paper showed two studies that demonstrated various perceptions of \nand adaptations to erosion by upland farmers, which challenged government \nassumptions and policies addressing upland degradation. \n 11\n In conclusion, I have argued that SLAs may allow environmental policy to avoid \nuniversalistic assumptions by organizing environmental interventions around more \nmeaningful, locally governed notions of risk. This point needs to be given more \nattention within debates about SLAs because definitions of risk are fundamental to \norganizing interventions. Yet, many assumptions (or \u2018narratives\u2019) of risk are not \nnecessarily appropriate, nor defined by people targeted by SLAs. \n Some critics have voiced these views already. According to Arce (2003, p. 200), \n\u2018neither community development nor sustainable livelihood approaches are \nconsistent idioms with a clear set of interrelated propositions.\u2019 Consequently, Arce \nagrees that \u2018the starting point of a SLA should be the actors\u2019 reality\u2019 (204). But is this \nhappening? This paper argues that the means to achieve this local sensitivity is to \nmove away from universalistic approaches to environmental risks, and instead \nacknowledge the local contexts in which risks exist, and how far adaptive capacity \ncan make some environmental changes alone (such as erosion) less important \nindicators of risk. \n Accordingly, SLAs should be seen in terms of a combination of local institutional \ndesign, plus a wider, less structured, basis for ideas (Hinshelwood, 2003). For SLAs \nto be effective, they must critique the organizing visions and discourses that define \nenvironmental risks in ways that exclude local consultation. This, of course, is a more \ncomplex and controversial undertaking, as it may challenge political objectives of \ngovernment agencies, or social visions of how certain regions or peoples should be \nmanaged. Working locally within vulnerable people to define risks, and working \nelsewhere to challenge assumptions about risks may both build sustainable \nlivelihoods, as well as implement a less universalistic approach to environmental \npolicy. \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlkire, S.

The GIS then calculated susceptibility to erosion \nusing the simple indicator of slop steepness. Each map was divided into categories to \nindicate \u2018most\u2019 and \u2018least\u2019 used or steep. The final map of predicted erosion was achieved by \nmultiplying the two indices of slope steepness and historic land use together, and dividing this \nindex into four quartiles, of which the highest and lowest quartiles indicated \u2018most\u2019 and \u2018least\u2019 \neroded land. \niv The study used the Cesium-137 method to measure soil erosion, which is based on the \nassumption that Cesium-137 isotopes were deposited evenly on soil after thermonuclear \nbomb tests of the 1950-60s. Soil erosion or sedimentation since this era can be measured by \ncomparing isotopes between eroded and uneroded sites. Conventionally, this approach \nprovides estimates of annual erosion since 1963 (the peak of isotope deposition), and soil \nmeasured to a depth of 25cm (Ritchie and McHenry 1990). \nv Underlain by granite, phyllite and shale, with sandy-clay soils, at an altitude of 7-900 meters. \nvi This point leaves undiscussed the question of the impact of fertilizers on soil and water \nquality, which this paper cannot do for reasons of space. \n 16\n"}
