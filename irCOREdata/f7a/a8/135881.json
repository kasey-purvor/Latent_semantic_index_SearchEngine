The latter enzyme disrupts the recycling of the essential cofactor (6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (6BH4) for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases as well as the nitric oxide synthases. In this report we have elucidated the influence of H2O2 on dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), the last enzyme in the 6BH4-recycling process.
