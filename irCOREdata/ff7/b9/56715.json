However, extensive mining, quarrying and  \nsinking of cored boreholes associated with the exploration and exploitation of coal,  \nironstone and refractory materials (including limestone) from the late 18th to the mid  \n20th century yielded a vast amount of detailed palaeontological and stratigraphical  \nknowledge of these rocks (Cameron & Stephenson 1985; Read et al. 2002; Trewin &  \nRollin 2002). Deep mining has ceased but the palaeontological material collected  \nduring exploration and exploitation has been retained, often as the sole remaining  \nsource of palaeontological data. This is a manifestation of a much wider phenomenon  \nthat emphasises the importance of historical palaeontological collections (e.g. see  \nAllmon 2005). The question then arises as to whether these data from the BGS  \ncollections are sufficiently complete to render them amenable to palaeoecological  \nanalysis. \n \nThe use of numerical methods in palaeontology is well established and has been used  \nto address a wide range of palaeontological problems (Harper 1999; Hammer &  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  3\nHarper 2006). Ideally, a systematic sampling programme should be undertaken to  \nprovide data for rigorous quantitative analysis of palaeoecological data (Etter 1999).  \nAlthough the BGS collections were not assembled as part of such a sampling exercise,  \na set of standard numerical exploratory techniques (see Hammer & Harper 2006, p. 6)  \nwas applied to the macrofaunas in these collections from the Hurlet and Index  \nlimestones in western Scotland (Figs 1, 2) to determine whether recurrent faunal  \nassemblages could be recognised and reasonable interpretations made in terms of  \npalaeoenvironments and lithofacies. The results of the analysis compare favourably  \nwith the published qualitative results of Wilson (1967; 1989) whose understanding  \nwas founded on a wealth of experience \u2018based on innumerable observations made  \nover forty years\u2019 (Wilson 1989, p. 111).  \n \nThe Hurlet and Index limestones: a review of the collected palaeontological \nmaterials \nThe Hurlet (Brigantian) and Index (Pendleian) limestones mark the bases of the  \nLower and Upper Limestone formations respectively (Fig. 2), and have been  \ncorrelated over most of central Scotland (see Wilson 1967; 1989; Browne et al.  \n1999). Both limestones occur at the southern margin of the Ayrshire Coalfield (Fig.  \n1), which is a region of current geological resurvey and 3D computer modelling by  \nthe British Geological Survey. The analysis of the macrofaunal assemblages forms  \npart of that work. \n \nThe fossils are mainly held in the Biostratigraphy collections in the British Geological  \nSurvey office in Edinburgh (see Dean 2002). They were collected from 67 localities  \n(14 for the Hurlet Limestone and 53 for the Index Limestone) over a period of  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  4\napproximately 136 years. The sample localities include both borehole and surface  \nexposures. The material from each locality was subdivided by hand specimen  \nlithology into mudstone\/claystone (undifferentiated), calcareous mudstone, sandstone,  \nsiltstone, calcareous siltstone, limestone, argillaceous limestone, and dolostone. This  \nresulted in 20 macrofaunal samples for the Hurlet Limestone and 94 samples for  \nthe Index Limestone. Fossil content was tabulated on a spreadsheet arranged by  \ngenera and species within major groups, each determination being made to the highest  \nlevel of confidence at the localities sampled. For lists of localities, taxa and sample  \nlithologies used in this study see Supplementary material.  \n \nThe data were compiled over time at the most detailed taxonomic level possible  \nfor each locality and so range from records of named species to indeterminate  \nmaterial ascribed only to a phylum. The limitations of the data owing to the gradual  \nacquisition of samples to the collection rather than palaeoecologically focused bulk  \nsampling (e.g. Etter 1999) include: \n\uf0b7 Samples differ in dimensions from pieces of core of various diameters to hand  \nspecimens of various sizes. It cannot be discounted that at least some of the \ndifferences among samples reflect differences in sample dimension, which at \npresent are not quantified but are very variable. \n\uf0b7 Specimens from the same locality were not necessarily obtained from the same  \nbed. \n\uf0b7 Taxonomic identifications in the database were undertaken by many  \npalaeontologists working on Carboniferous fossils since 1870. Hence they are  \npolythetic and in most instances are not underpinned by systematic monographic  \nstudies or ecophenotypic analysis of the material. For older determinations the  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  5\ntaxonomy may in some cases need updating. \n\uf0b7 The collections lack any taphonomic assessment such as the degree to which the  \nfossils were autochthonous or allochthonous. \n\uf0b7 Crucially, only presence\/absence (binary) data are available and this provides a  \nmajor limitation on the range of numerical methods that can be applied. \n \nConsolidation and restriction of the data sets \nTo overcome limitations of sample size and limited taxonomic overlap between  \nsamples in the exploratory analyses, which aim to identify similarities between groups  \nof samples, successive iterations of the analyses were undertaken on increasingly  \nconsolidated or restricted versions of the original data. \n \nThe species- and genus-level data were consolidated by removing records of  \nindeterminate brachiopods, bivalves and gastropods where named taxa of these \ngroups were recorded from the same sample. If a species was unequivocally identified  \nat any locality in the species-level data set, that name was also applied to all other  \n\u2018aff.\u2019, \u2018cf.\u2019 and \u2018?\u2019 determinations applied to that binomen. Next, all taxa restricted to  \na single locality were excluded so that the analyses of these \u2018unique taxa excluded\u2019  \ndata were based solely on shared occurrences thus reducing considerably the amount  \nof \u2018noise\u2019 in the data. In addition, the genus-level \u2018consolidated\u2019 data were further  \nrestricted to higher level taxa (essentially a mixture of phyla and classes), with the  \nnumber of genera present in each group recorded rather than simple presence or  \nabsence. This provides a measure of diversity within the higher taxa and is amenable  \nto ordination using PCA as well as cluster analysis based on quantitative data. \n \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  6\nNumerical methodology \nThe consolidated data in binary (presence\/absence) format was analysed using the  \nstatistical package PAST (PAlaeontological STatistics) (Hammer et al. 2001), which  \nis available on the Internet as freeware, is periodically updated and refined, and is  \nfully supported by an extensive manual. \n \nFour data sets, comprising the Hurlet Limestone species and genera, and Index  \nLimestone species and genera, were transferred into PAST and analysed as described  \nbelow. Seriation, cluster analysis and to some extent non-metric multidimensional  \nscaling (NMDS) proved suitable techniques for use on the binary data, whilst  \ncluster analysis and PCA were appropriate for the diversity data within high level  \nclades. \n \nSeriation reorganises the original binary data matrix to group shared presences of taxa  \nalong a diagonal. Unconstrained optimization enables the ordering of both the taxa  \nand localities to achieve a best fit and the ordering of the localities reflects their  \nposition along a palaeoecological, palaeobiogeographical and\/or temporal gradient.  \nThe fewer the influencing factors (such as water depth, substrate characteristics,  \nsalinity and oxygenation), the better the clustering along the diagonal and therefore  \nthe higher the fitness criterion computed for the seriation. These fitness criteria are  \ntherefore much higher for the consolidated data than for the preliminary analyses,  \nwhich included taxa unique to any one locality. For example, the species-level  \nseriated matrices gave fitness a criterion of 0.721 for the consolidated data compared  \nwith 0.397 for the raw, unconsolidated, data for the Hurlet Limestone  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  7\npalaeontological data set and 0.288 cf. 0.139 for the equivalent Index limestone data \nset. When the samples were subdivided by lithology, consolidation generated fitness \ncriteria on the seriations of 0.635 cf. 0.285 and 0.17 cf. 0.11 for the Hurlet and Index \nlimestones respectively. Constraining the seriations, by fixing the ordering of samples \nof a particular lithology, forces the grouping of other lithologies. For example, \nconstraining the limestone subset in the species-level seriated matrix for the Hurlet \nLimestone using the consolidated data set with unique taxa excluded reduced the \nfitness criterion from 0.635 to 0.403. However, this constrained analysis resulted in \nthe grouping of other lithologies, suggesting ranges of lithofacies tolerance for \nindividual species. \n \nQ-mode analysis was used in the cluster analyses to distinguish groups of samples  \nwith similar faunas. Three similarity indices, Dice, Simpson and Raup-Crick, were  \nemployed and the clusters joined using the un-weighted pair group average (UPGMA)  \nalgorithm. The Dice coefficient was used in the NMDS where persistent patterns in  \nthe resultant two dimensional plots of ranked (rather than absolute) difference  \nbetween samples were taken to reflect genuine structure within the data. \n \nPCA is a widely used eigenvector technique, which operates on a correlation or  \nvariance-covariance matrix (Davis 1986) to identify as much of the variation in a set  \nof data and to seek structure within the samples (see Hammer & Harper 2006). The  \nfirst principal component is always orientated in the direction of maximum variation  \nin the sample; the second and subsequent components are perpendicular to the first,  \nexplaining decreasing amounts of variation. As is common in such analyses, the first  \ntwo or three eigenvectors in the present study contained most of the sample variation. \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  8\n \nIn the first instance, the \u2018palaeontological\u2019 data fields for both the Hurlet and Index  \nlimestones were analysed prior to possible links to lithology being explored.  The  \nlatter involved subdividing the faunal lists from many of the localities in terms of the  \nlithology of the rocks in which each fossil is contained. This increases the information  \nattached to each faunal occurrence but decreases many of the sample sizes and  \ndiversities. \n \nResults \nPalaeontological data alone \nMost of the Hurlet Limestone samples are lithologically homogenous and 33% of  \nspecies and 36% of genera in the original palaeontological data set occur at multiple  \nlocalities. By consolidating the data, the percentage of shared genera increases to  \n46%. Excluding taxa restricted to single localities produced minor changes in the  \norder of the localities and higher fitness criteria in the seriated data (e.g. Fig. 3)  \ntogether with more consistency of clustering among different similarity coefficients  \nused in the cluster analyses (Fig. 4). The last of these is encouraging given the  \ndifferent emphases that these coefficients have in terms of co-occurrences, relative  \nsample size or the mathematical processes involved (e.g. see Hammer & Harper 2006,  \npp. 212\u2013213). Three groups of localities were consistently identified in the various  \nseriations and are also recognised by NMDS. Group 1, which also emerges  \nconsistently in the cluster analyses (Fig. 4) comprises Carskeoch (locality 12),  \nDaldilling (26), Nethershield (55), River Ayr (Windy Burn) (65) and Windy Burn  \n(67); Group 2 comprises Cairnshalloch Limeworks (9), Captain\u2019s Glen (11), Dailly  \nStation (24), Heronspark Burn (36), Meikleholm Burn (52) and Quarrelhill Burn (57);  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  9\nGroup 3 comprises Auchmillanhill Bore (1), Captain\u2019s Bridge (10) and River Ayr  \n(Upper Heilar) (64). \n \nThese three groups of localities were discriminated purely on the basis of their faunal  \nassociation but there are some broad links between these faunal associations and  \nlithofacies: \n(i)  Group 1 is a fauna characteristic of clearer water conditions with a preferrence \n for a firm substrate. It is linked to a wide range of lithologies, particularly \n limestone; \n(ii) Group 2 is a fauna characteristic of clear water conditions with a preferrence \n for a soft substrate. It is linked to an association of limestone-dominated \n lithofacies; \n(iii) Group 3 is a low diversity fauna with a preference for muddier water \n conditions and a soft substrate. It is linked to a siliciclastic lithofacies. \nThese results closely mimic the seminal semi-quantitative analysis published by  \nWilson (1989), who presented, in generalised diagrammatic form (Wilson 1989, fig.  \n9), the occurrence of the most commonly found marine fossils of the Dinantian of  \ncentral Scotland in relation to the lithology of the host rocks. He related the fossils, at  \ngroup and genus-level, to the lithology they were found in (mudstones and  \nlimestones with increasing or decreasing calcareous and siliciclastic content). From  \nthis he deduced their living environments on the continental shelf, which ranged from  \na nearshore zone with muddy water, to offshore or nearshore zones with clearer  \nwater. The parallels between the quantitatively determined groupings of faunas  \nrecognised in the BGS collections in the present study and those recognised by  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  10\nWilson with his wealth of field experience demonstrate that geologically significant  \npatterns can be recognised in the historical palaeontological data sets not originally  \ncollected for this purpose. \n \nRestricting the genus-level consolidated data to higher taxonomic groups and  \nrecording the number of genera present in each group, provided a measure of diversity  \nwithin the higher taxa (Fig. 5) that was amenable to cluster analysis and PCA (Fig. 6).  \nThe grouping of localities evident in the species- and genus-level analyses were not  \ngenerally preserved in the cluster analyses of the quantitative data, but two large  \ngroups of localities were distinguished. These also form non-overlapping portions of  \nthe plot of the second and third components of the PCA. Some differentiation of the  \nsamples is provided by the third component. These include gastropods at localities 10,  \n12 and 52 with loadings around zero; anthozoans and bryozoans at localities 65 and  \n67 with low positive loadings; and nautiloids and others at localities 9, 24 and 57 with  \nhigher positive loadings. \n \nIn contrast, however, the picture was far from clear for the lithologically more  \nheterogeneous Index Limestone, a thicker depositional unit with a much larger  \nnumber of samples. No clear palaeoecological patterns emerged from the five  \nassociations discriminated in the solely palaeontological data by cluster analysis. \n \nInclusion of lithological data \nSubdividing the samples on the basis of the lithology containing the fossils provides  \nan explicit link between faunal associations and a potentially very important facet of  \nthe palaeoenvironment. \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  11\n \nHurlet Limestone \nThe unconstrained seriations of consolidated data at both species- and genus-level for  \nall taxa from the Hurlet Limestone are very similar and have fairly low fitness criteria  \nof 0.33 and 0.35 respectively. Excluding taxa restricted to any one locality produces a  \nlarge increase in the fitness criterion to 0.635 and 0.617 respectively (Figs 7, 8).  \nApart from the distinction of siltstone samples in the genus-level seriation there is no  \ngrouping of samples by lithology. Constrained seriation, based on the order of the  \nlimestone samples that emerged from an unconstrained analysis of the limestone  \nsamples alone produces a grouping of the other lithologies (Figs 9, 10) albeit with  \nlower fitness criteria than the equivalent unconstrained  seriations. The seriations  \nshow that tolerance ranges of some taxa within the carbonate environments extend  \ninto other lithofacies in a systematic way across environmental gradients. \n \nCluster analyses of species- and genus-level data sets (all taxa and unique taxa  \nexcluded) do not reveal consistent patterns. However, recurring groupings of samples  \nemerge from cluster analysis of the numbers of genera within higher taxa. Application  \nof both the Dice and Raup-Crick coefficients to this \u2018higher taxa\u2019 data set show three  \nmajor clusters (Ht 1\u2013Ht 3), five sub-clusters (Ht 1.1\u2013Ht 3.1), and five close pairings  \n(Ht 1.1.1\u2013Ht 3.1.2)  (Fig. 11). The three major clusters can also be recognised on the  \nunconstrained seriation of the whole data set and even more closely in the subset of  \nlimestone samples. Again this suggests changing co-occurrences of taxa across an  \nenvironmental gradient. \n \nThe first three components of the PCA represent 93% of the variation within the  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  12\n\u2018higher taxa\u2019 data set from the Hurlet Limestone, with 81 % represented by Principal  \nComponent 1. The main variables along these three principal components are, in turn:  \n(1) brachiopods; (2) bivalves; and (3) crinoids and bryozoans (with algae,  \nforaminifera and crustaceans). The major clusters identified in the cluster analysis (Ht  \n1, Ht 2 and Ht 3, Fig. 13) can also be recognised on the PCA plots (Fig. 12); their  \ndistributions reflecting differences in trophic structure of the faunal associations (and  \ntherefore differences in environment). Both the cluster analysis and PCA of the  \ndiversity data reveal three major clusters that account for all but 2 of the samples.  \nThese groups cut across lithofacies but reflect differences in taxonomic composition  \nand trophic structure.  \n\uf0b7 Ht 1 includes seven samples. The lithofacies represented are limestone (with  \ndolostone) (57%) and argillaceous limestone, mudstone\/claystone  \n(undifferentiated)\/calcareous mudstone, and siltstone (about 14% each). The  \nfauna includes brachiopods (59% of all genera recorded within the cluster)  \nwith 1\u20139 genera present in each sample, bivalves (21%) with 0\u20133 genera, and  \ncrinoid columnals (13%) with 0\u20131 genera.  \n\uf0b7 Ht 2 includes seven samples. The lithofacies represented are argillaceous  \nlimestone (43%), limestone (29%) and calcareous sandstone and siltstone  \n(14% each). The fauna includes mainly brachiopods (93%) with 1\u20134 genera,  \nand gastropods (7%) with 0\u20131 genera.  \n\uf0b7 Ht 3 includes five samples. The lithofacies represented are limestone (80%)  \nand mudstone\/claystone (undifferentiated) (20%). The fauna includes mainly  \nbrachiopods (63%) with 1\u20138 genera, crinoids (19%) with one genus, and  \nbryozoa (11%) with 0\u20132 genera. \n \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  13\nIndex Limestone \nThe fitness criteria for the unconstrained seriations of the species- (0.06) and genus-  \n(0.11) level data sets for all taxa and even for the data with the unique taxa excluded  \nare very low (species 0.17 and genera 0.20), and none show grouping of samples  \nfrom similar lithologies. Constraining the genus-level seriation by the ordering  \ndetermined for the limestone samples alone results in most of the other lithologies  \ngrouping together, but the fitness criterion is extremely low (0.10) and there is no  \nclear relationship between lithofacies and faunas. However, the broad grouping of the  \nlithologies suggests that some taxa were distributed along environmental gradients  \nwithin the carbonate depositional setting and extended outside it into other  \nsedimentary environments in a non-random way. \n \nThe results of cluster analyses of all the species- and genus-level data sets do not  \nshow any consistent groupings. However, cluster analysis of the higher taxa  \n\u2018diversity\u2019 data set using both the Dice and Raup-Crick coefficients shows eight  \nnested clusters (Ix 1.1\u2013Ix 2.6) of three or more samples (Fig. 13) within two major  \nclusters (Ix 1 and Ix 2), broadly reflecting differences in lithology. This suggests there  \nis a crude link between lithology and the diversity and distribution of genera among  \nthe higher taxa. \n \nMost of the variation in the \u2018higher taxa\u2019 data set for the Index Limestone is expressed  \nby components 1 and 2 of the PCA which together comprise almost 89% of the  \nvariance in the data; the third component accounts for 4%. The main loadings on  \nthese components are, sequentially: (1) brachiopods and bivalves (strong positive  \nloading); (2) brachiopods (strong negative loading); and (3) gastropods. The  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  14\nmajor and nested clusters discerned in the cluster analysis can also be distinguished to  \nsome extent on the PCA plots (Fig. 14). In general, the most calcareous mudstone \nfaunas in the Index Limestone are mainly included in major cluster Ix 1 and are of \nlow diversity with brachiopods the dominant or sole component and molluscs \ngenerally absent. Sandstones and especially siltstones are mainly included major  \ncluster Ix 2 and have moderate to high diversities of brachiopods and bivalves with  \ngastropods present in some cases. \n \nPalaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the structure \nidentified in the collections \nHurlet Limestone \nThe lithofacies and environmental gradients of taxa selected from the genus-level  \nconstrained seriation of the unique taxa excluded data set are shown in Figure 15.  \nThese taxa are included in the three faunal groups previously identified, and their  \npalaeoecology accords with the interpretations of Wilson (1989). \n \nThe dominant taxa, general trophic structure and palaeoenvironment occupied by the  \ngroups of samples identified by cluster analysis of the higher taxa data set (Fig. 11)  \nand to a large extent recognisable in the PCA plots (Fig. 12) can be summarised as  \nfollows: \n\uf0b7 Ht 1 contains brachiopods and bivalves and, in most samples, crinoid \ncolumnals. The epifaunal brachiopods will have colonised a range of  \nsubstrates depending upon whether they were pedunculate or free lying, but  \nthe bivalves are considered to represent infauna with a preference for more  \nmuddy substrates. The lithologies of the samples suggest that this major  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  15\ncluster represents a great range of environments, but mainly clear water in the  \noff- or nearshore zones. \n\uf0b7 Ht 2 is dominated by brachiopods indicating a range of substrates depending  \nupon whether they were semi-infaunal, pedunculate or free lying. Gastropods  \nalso occur, which may have preferred to graze or plough carbonate mud.  \n\uf0b7 Ht 3 is of epifaunal forms, mainly brachiopods and crinoids most of which  \nwill have flourished on firmer substrates. \n \nIndex Limestone \nSeriation of all the consolidated genus-level data with the samples constrained to the  \norder obtained by seriating the limestone samples alone suggests that the faunal  \ngradients within the carbonate depositional environments can be extended into  \nincreasingly coarse siliciclastic sediments. Figures 16 and 17 show this for taxa that  \nhave, respectively, an extensive and a limited range within the carbonate environment. \n \nThe major clusters and their sub-clusters identified in the cluster analysis for the  \nhigher taxa data set are at least partially recognised on the ordination of samples on  \nthe PCA and show links between faunal associations and lithologies that reflect the  \nexploitation of subtly different environments. A detailed analysis of the composition  \nand trophic structure of the clusters will form part of a separate study; suffice it to  \nnote here that: \n \nIx 1 is dominated by brachiopods and includes mainly calcareous lithofacies. The  \nlimestone lithologies indicate clearer water, the offshore or nearshore zones, firmer  \nsubstrates, and dominant epifaunal forms. The slightly calcareous mudstone and  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  16\nmudstone\/claystone (undifferentiated) lithologies provide evidence of the  \nintermediate to muddy nearshore zones, the latter especially with less firm substrates  \ndominated by infaunal forms. The siltstone lithology of a single sample provides  \nalmost insignificant evidence of a zone considered to represent river sediment influx. \n \nIx 2 is dominated by brachiopods and various molluscs. It includes mainly calcareous  \nlithofacies, but with a significant proportion of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The  \nlimestone, and slightly calcareous mudstone and mudstone\/claystone  \n(undifferentiated) lithologies are indicative of the same palaeoenvironments and  \nfaunal associations as for Ix 1. The siltstone and sandstone lithologies show a  \nsiliciclastic environment in what is considered to represent a zone of river sediment  \ninflux. \n \nConclusions \n\uf0b7 Exploratory numerical techniques can be successfully applied to historical  \npalaeontological collections (not originally intended to investigate  \npalaeoecology) to distinguish palaeoecologically meaningful faunal  \nassociations and their palaeoenvironmental setting. \n\uf0b7 Records of sample locality and lithology (\u2018environmental data\u2019) and fossil  \ncontent (described by major fossil groups, genera and species) can be used; the  \nlimitations of sample size, taxonomic overlap and solely binary (presence or  \nabsence) data being minimised by excluding all \u2018one off\u2019 occurrences of fossil  \ntaxa and analysing increasingly consolidated or restricted versions of the  \noriginal information.  \n\uf0b7 Seriation, cluster analysis and NMDS are suitable techniques for use on  \nAyrshire methods submitted for publication.doc   \n  17\n binary data, whilst the distribution of genera within higher taxonomic groups  \n can be used as a proxy for abundance data to distinguish meaningful faunal  \n associations using cluster analysis and PCA.  \n\uf0b7 Seriation can be used to indicate the lithological and environmental gradients  \nof some taxa. Cluster analysis can reveal groups of samples, linking lithology  \nand the diversity and distribution of taxa. PCA can explain the distribution of  \nthe clusters in terms of differences in taxonomic composition, trophic  \nstructure, lithology and environment. \n\uf0b7 Quantitative analysis of the historical BGS collections from the Hurlet and  \nIndex limestones confirms the relationship between lithofacies and  \npalaeoenvironment inferred by Wilson (1989) and enables the recognition of  \nmore subtle patterns not identifiable by qualitative means. \n\uf0b7 The success of this study unlocks the potential for palaeoecological \n interpretation by multivariate numerical analysis of historical collections not  \n originally intended to investigate palaeoecology. An example of such a  \n collection is that of the BGS, where a vast resource, originally collected for  \n biostratigraphy, now awaits renaissance in palaeoecology. \n \nAcknowledgements \nA. W.
