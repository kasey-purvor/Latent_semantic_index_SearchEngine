INTRODUCTION 27 \nAnion-exchange (aIEX) is the most frequently adopted technology for nitrate (NO3-) 28 \nremoval during potable water treatment due to its low cost and operational simplicity. 29 \nA strong salt (NaCl) solution is used to regenerate the resin resulting in the production 30 \nof concentrated waste brine containing the target anion, chloride and other oxyanions. 31 \nThis waste stream can comprise 0.8 to 2.4% of treated product flow (McAdam and 32 \nJudd, 2008) and its disposal (usually by tankering) constitutes a significant proportion 33 \nof the process cost.  Operation of aIEX in combination with biological nitrate 34 \nreduction of the waste brine for regenerant recovery presents a more sustainable 35 \nalternative by reducing the waste volume, salt (NaCl) consumption and treated 36 \nproduct losses. 37 \n 38 \nStudies adapting non-halophilic microbial communities from standard activated 39 \nsludge processes for this application have reported inhibition of denitrification and, in 40 \nsome cases, plasmolysis to be promoted by the elevated salt concentrations 41 \n(>30gNaCl.l-1). More recently, halophilic monocultures Halomonas denitrificans 42 \n(Cyplik et al., 2007) and Halomonas campisalis (Peyton et al., 2001) have been 43 \nsuccessfully adapted at laboratory scale for denitrification at high salt concentrations 44 \nfrom 30 to 180 g.l-1, obviating dilution prior to biotreatment. However, adaptation of 45 \nhalophiles to brine processing is yet to be examined in detail.  46 \n 47 \nOther restrictions to this application include the accumulation of inorganic 48 \nconstituents (e.g. sulphate) due to recirculation, and the impact of organics and 49 \nmicrobial carryover from the bioreactor on downstream resin regeneration. In brine 50 \nre-use trials, elevated sulphate concentrations were not reported to impact upon either 51 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n3 \n \nresin or biological performance when nitrate selective resins have been used (Clifford 52 \nand Liu, 1993). However, Bae et al. (2002) reported that microbial associated 53 \nparticulates and organics present in the regenerant fouled anion exchange resins, thus 54 \nthe integration of both sand filtration and GAC were required downstream of the 55 \ndenitrification reactor to nullify the impact. Though little information exists on the 56 \nimpact of residual organics on resin capacity, the application of \u201cclassical\u201d biomass 57 \nseparation membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology to this duty has been mooted to 58 \nprovide absolute bacterial rejection and high MW biopolymer retention, promoting a 59 \nconsistent permeate quality (McAdam and Judd, 2008).                    60 \n 61 \nThe current paper assesses the viability of a denitrification MBR for waste aIEX brine 62 \ntreatment and reuse in the regeneration of ion exchange resins, specifically this study 63 \nwill address: the fate of organics during permeate brine recirculation (to simulate re-64 \nuse); the impact of organics on resin capacity; the influence of salt variation on 65 \nhalophilic treatment performance; and the impact of perturbation on fouling 66 \npropensity. 67 \n 68 \n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 69 \n2.1 Experimental rig 70 \nTo establish a salt tolerant bacterial community, a seed culture was harvested from the 71 \nanaerobic layer of a coastal sediment at low tide. Following acclimation in batch 72 \nconditions (50 gNaCl.l-1, 500 mgNO3--N.l-1), a 75 l reactor (Figure 1) was seeded at a 73 \nv\/v ratio of 15:1. The influent nitrate concentration was set at 500 mg NO3--N.l-1. 74 \nDuring substrate optimisation, ethanol was supplied as the exogenous substrate and 75 \ndosed at a C:N ratio of between 0.77:1 and 8.5:1 (g.g-1); under normal conditions, a 76 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n4 \n \nC:N of 0.85:1 was used. Reactor temperature was maintained at c.20\u00baC using a 77 \nthermostatically controlled heating jacket. An impeller mixer was used to ensure 78 \ncomplete biomass distribution with the impeller blade sited below the membrane 79 \nmodule. The hydraulic and solids residence times (HRT and SRT respectively) were 80 \n17.5 hours and 10 days respectively. The process was allowed 3 SRTs to acclimatise 81 \nprior to testing. During recirculation experiments, MBR permeate was collected in a 82 \nholding tank (T2), supplemented with NO3- and pumped back to the feed tank (T1). 83 \nDuring salt upshocking\/ downshocking experiments, the NaCl concentrate dosed into 84 \nT1 was changed to meet the required concentration providing an incremental spike; 85 \nfluid residence time in T1 was approximately 20 hours.   86 \n 87 \nA 0.93 m2 out-to-in immersed PVDF hollow-fibre membrane with 0.04 \u00b5m nominal 88 \npore size was used. Permeate was withdrawn under suction from the membrane using 89 \na piston pump (FMI Inc., Syosset, US). To maintain anoxic conditions, nitrogen-90 \nenriched air (>99%) was used to scour the membrane. Gas was introduced via a 91 \nsolenoid valve (Zoedale Plc, Bedford, UK) and controlled with a programmable 92 \ndigital relay (K\u00fcbler Gmbh, Ludwigshafen, Germany); flow rate was controlled with 93 \na 0-50 l min-1 needle valve (RS Ltd., Corby, UK). Pressure was monitored using a -94 \n0.5 to 0.5 barg calibrated pressure transducer (Gem Sensors, Basingstoke, UK) and 95 \ndata recorded using a 16-bit 0 to 2.5 V data conversion unit (Pico technology, St. 96 \nNeots, UK). 97 \n 98 \n2.2 Anion exchange resin 99 \nA commercially available nitrate selective macroporous styrene based anion exchange 100 \nresin (Purolite A520E, Llantrisant, UK) was loaded into a 50mm diameter x 1m glass 101 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5 \n \nchromatography column and retained using 25 \u00b5m-rated frits at either end; the bed 102 \ncomprised 120g of resin. After initial rinsing, the A520E resin size ranged from 0.28 103 \nto 1.26 mm (d50 0.61 mm).  Prior to use, DI water was pumped through the resin bed 104 \nat 20 bed volumes (Bv).h-1 for 30 minutes, followed by a 30 minute 50gNaCl.l-1 flush 105 \n(to ensure saturation) at 5 Bv.h-1 and a subsequent DI rinse for 60 minutes at 5 Bv.h-1. 106 \nThe exhaustion flow rate was set to 20 Bv.h-1 and the IEX feed contained 30 mgSO42-107 \n.l-1, 115 mgCl-.l-1, 150 mgCaCO3.l-1 and 22.6 mg.l-1 NO3--N. Regeneration comprised 108 \na 60 minute cycle at 5 Bv.h-1 followed by slow and fast rinses of 5 Bv.h-1 for 30 109 \nminutes and 20 Bv.h-1 for 10 minutes respectively.    110 \n 111 \n2.3 Chemical analysis 112 \n2.3.1 General analysis 113 \nMixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and bicarbonate were determined by standard 114 \nmethods. Oxyanion (NO3-, NO2-) and chloride concentration was measured using 115 \nproprietary cell tests (Merck Spectroquant) with spectrophotometric detection. 116 \nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A 117 \nanalyser. Ethanol concentration was determined using a commercially available 118 \nenzymatic method (Boehringer-Mannheim, Roche). Soluble microbial products 119 \n(SMP) were extracted according to the method described in Judd (2006) and 120 \npolysaccharide and protein concentration quantified using the phenol\u2013sulphuric acid 121 \nmethod (Zhang et al., 1999) and modified Lowry method (Fr\u00f8lund et al., 1995) 122 \nrespectively. Absorbance for polysaccharide and protein determinations was 123 \nmeasured using a Jenway 6505 UV\/Vis spectrophotometer at UV480nm and UV750nm 124 \nrespectively with D-glucose and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standards. Particle 125 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n6 \n \nsize distribution was measured with an integrated laser diffractor (Malvern 126 \nMastersizer 2000).  127 \n 128 \n2.3.2 Molecular weight fractionation 129 \nSerial fractionation was undertaken using an Amicon 8400 series stirred cell, 130 \npressurised with N2 (1 barg), and standard UF (Millipore) membranes, size range 10, 131 \n30, 50, 100 and 300kDa. Sample supernatant was pre-filtered using a 1.2\u00b5m filter and 132 \nthe subsequent sample split between two 300 kDa membranes to limit concentration 133 \npolarisation. Concentration polarisation was limited by application of an integrated 134 \nbar stirrer operate at a constant 100 rpm; the adopted filtrate\/ retentate ratio was 0.4.  135 \n 136 \n2.3.3 Phospholipid fatty acid analysis 137 \nPhospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to assess the community structure 138 \nusing the method of Frosteg\u00e5rd et al. (1991). Samples were freeze dried prior to 139 \nanalysis. Lipids were extracted from the freeze dried sample using the Bligh and Dyer 140 \n(1959) ratio of 1:2:0.8 (v\/v\/v) of chloroform, methanol and citrate buffer. Lipids were 141 \nthen fractionated by solid phase extraction. The phospholipid fraction was derivatised 142 \nby mild alkaline methanolysis (Dowling et al., 1986). The resultant fatty-acid methyl 143 \nesters (FAMES) were analyzed by GC-FID (Agilent). Peak identification was 144 \nundertaken using GC-MS (Agilent). 145 \n 146 \n3. RESULTS 147 \n3.1 Exogenous and endogenous organics transmission at steady state 148 \nNitrate removal efficiency increased from 84.6% to a maximum 99.8% as the carbon 149 \nto nitrogen ratio (C:N) increased from 0.77 to 0.94 (Figure 2). Once a C:N ratio of 150 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n7 \n \n0.89 had been exceeded, ethanol was detected in the permeate above the limit of 151 \ndetection (>0.5 mg l-1). Although the existence of an optimum C:N has been reported 152 \npreviously (McAdam et al., 2007), research studies typically observe low NO2--N and 153 \nNO3--N effluent concentrations as the optimum C:N is exceeded due to the surplus of 154 \navailable carbon (Chiu and Chung, 2003; McAdam et al., 2007). In this study, on 155 \nincreasing C:N >0.98 inhibition was observed resulting in 71-97% of the available 156 \nNO3- being converted to NO2- for C:N values up to 8.5. Yoshie et al. (2006) also 157 \nreported nitrite accumulation in concentrated brines indicating reductase activity 158 \nmaybe very different at high salinity. 159 \n 160 \nProtein and polysaccharide transmission through the membrane at steady state were 161 \n27.3%\u00b18.0% and 81.5%\u00b110.5% respectively. Fawehinmi (2006) observed similar 162 \ntransmission rates for proteins and polysaccharides, recording 49% and 80% 163 \nrespectively, for operation of an anaerobic immersed hollow fibre (0.1 \u00b5m) MBR. In 164 \nthis study, SMP exhibited a principal protein peak of 55.1% between <1.2 \u00b5m and 165 \n300 kDa and a principal polysaccharide peak of 48.3% below 10 kDa (Figure 3). 166 \nOrganics between 1.2 \u03bcm and 100 kDa were absent in the permeate indicating the 167 \nmolecular weight cut off (MWCO) of the hollow-fibre (and any associated biofilm) 168 \nwas c.50 to 100 kDa. 169 \n 170 \n3.2 Impact of organics accumulation during recirculation 171 \nAfter 7 days recirculation, the SMP DOC had increased from an initial concentration 172 \nof c.170 mgDOC.l-1 (c.34 mgDOC.gMLSS-1) up to a maximum concentration of 557 173 \nmgDOC.l-1 (Figure 4). At steady state, DOC transmission was recorded between 54% 174 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n8 \n \nand 80% and was attributed to accumulation of low molecular weight (MW) organics 175 \n(below the membrane MWCO).  176 \n 177 \nCritical flux analysis (Jc) was conducted using the flux step method before 178 \nrecirculation and after reaching steady state (Figure 5). In both cases, Jc was between 179 \n12 and 15 l.m-2.h-1. Interestingly, similar exponential dP\/dt trends were obtained for 180 \nboth sets of conditions, evidenced by similar gradients ((dP\/dt)\/J) of between 0.23 and 181 \n0.27, however, dP\/dt measured post-recirculation exhibited lower overall fouling 182 \npotential. This appears counter-intuitive, based on the presence of accumulated 183 \norganics and challenges previous reports which link fouling propensity to elevated 184 \nconcentrations of biopolymers in the bulk phase (Judd, 2006; Reid et al., 2006).  185 \n 186 \n3.3 IEX Resin capacity 187 \nTo allow comparison with previous aIEX resin studies (Clifford and Liu, 1993; Bae et 188 \nal., 2002), NO3--N breakthrough curves were determined using a 10 mgN.l-1 threshold 189 \neffluent concentration (US regulatory limit). Breakthrough curves (1 to 6) were run to 190 \ncomplete exhaustion initially using freshly produced regenerant (Brinefp, 50gNaCl.l-1, 191 \nFigure 6(a)). The threshold was reached at c.400 bed volumes (BVs) in the second run 192 \nwhich corresponded to a resin capacity of 0.61 eq.l-1 or 88% of throughput obtained 193 \nwith the virgin resin during the first run. Subsequent runs 3 to 6 indicated a near 194 \nidentical trend demonstrating reproducible regeneration efficiency under these 195 \nconditions. A capacity of c.0.46 eq.l-1 has been observed previously by Bae et al. 196 \n(2002) using the same commercially available resin (A520E); the lower capacity may 197 \nbe explained by the authors\u2019 application of a lower strength regenerant (30gNaCl.l-1). 198 \n 199 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n9 \n \nBreakthrough curves (1-6) were subsequently generated with fresh resin using 200 \nbiologically treated brine (Brinebt, 50gNaCl.l-1) as the regenerant (Figure 6(b)). 201 \nBrinebt was sampled from the MBR permeate once steady state had been reached 202 \nduring permeate recirculation. At steady state, the DOC concentration of the brinebt 203 \nwas c.287 mg.l-1. Under these conditions, breakthrough occurred at c.390 BVs in the 204 \nsecond run, corresponding to 0.58 eq.l-1 or 87% of throughput obtained with the virgin 205 \nresin during the first run. Comparison with Run 4 (a) using brinefp (Figure 6(b)) 206 \ndemonstrated a loss in capacity (Area 1) indicating the extent of interference created 207 \nby the biologically derived organics. Integration of the area between the brinefp and 208 \nbrinebt exhaustion curves recorded a capacity loss of 59 meq.l-1 or c.6.5% of the 209 \nestimated exhaustive resin capacity.  Bae et al. (2002) observed significant capacity 210 \nlosses when using permeate from an upflow sludge blanket reactor (USBR) for 211 \nregeneration unless subsequent treatment steps were incorporated. However, in this 212 \nstudy subsequent regenerations using brinebt displayed a similar reproducibility 213 \nindicating that the resin had reached a maximum organic capacity at the end of the 214 \nfirst regeneration cycle.  215 \n 216 \nThe uptake of brinebt organics by the resin was quantified using a virgin salt saturated 217 \nresin (Figure 7). Brine regenerant was assumed to exit the column once chloride 218 \ntransmission reached 100% (assuming chloride uptake to be zero at saturation). 219 \nChloride and protein transmission reached 100% simultaneously between 1 and 1.5 220 \nBVs indicating protein adsorption to be negligible. Polysaccharide and DOC 221 \ntransmission were recorded at c.15% and c.90% respectively up to 4 BVs, where a 222 \nrapid increase in transmission in the interval between 4 and 7 BVs was observed. At 7 223 \nBVs, polysaccharide and DOC transmission reached 100%, indicating saturation of 224 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n10 \n \nthe resin with polysaccharide. Total adsorbed DOC on the 120g resin bed was 225 \nestimated at 26.4 mg (0.22 mgDOC.gResin). During exhaustion\/regeneration cycles 226 \n(Figure 6(b)), the adsorptive mechanism of the polysaccharides was evaluated by 227 \nregenerating the resin with a 50\/50 fresh brine\/biological regenerant (Run 5) and 228 \n100% fresh brine (Run 6). The similarity of the subsequent exhaustion curves 229 \nsuggested low polysaccharide exchange potential (i.e. reversibility).  230 \n 231 \n3.4 Salt shocking 232 \nTo reflect the significant salt variations occurring in brine regenerant waste, the 233 \nregenerant was initially upshocked to 75 gNaCl.l-1 which was subsequently further 234 \nincreased to 100 gNaCl.l-1 after 7 days. Following the initial upshock (75 gNaCl l-1), 235 \nnitrate removal decreased from 99.7 to 60.1% (Table 1) demonstrating a decrease in 236 \nthe specific biomass denitrification capacity. Protein release was also recorded with 237 \nan increase in bulk phase concentration from c.30 to c.50 mg.l-1 and from c.15 to c.30 238 \nmg.l-1 following salt upshock to 75 and 100 gNaCl.l-1 respectively (Figure 8). A 239 \ntransition in floc structure also occurred; at steady state (50 gNaCl.l-1), a floc size 240 \ndistribution ranging 60 to 800\u03bcm was measured, however, following upshocking to 241 \n75 gNaCl.l-1, a bi-modal distribution was recorded with the dominant peak ranging 242 \n0.2 to 5\u03bcm, indicating floc breakage into primary particles (Wil\u00e9n et al., 2003). After 243 \n7 days at 100gNaCl.l-1, the system was downshocked to 50 gNaCl.l-1; sampling 24 244 \nhours after downshocking demonstrated near complete denitrification recovery to 245 \n98.4%.   246 \n 247 \nAlthough the volume of particulate and colloidal material had apparently increased, 248 \ncritical flux analysis conducted before and after each salt increment (Figure 9) 249 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n11 \n \nindicated that fouling propensity remained stable as demonstrated by the similar dP\/dt 250 \ntrends obtained. In addition, Jc was consistently recorded at c.12 l.m-2.h-1 and is 251 \ncomparable to that recorded during steady-state recirculation. This contradicts a 252 \nprevious non-halophilic MBR study where upon exposure to a 5 g.l-1 chloride residual 253 \n(0.83% NaCl) both protein and polysaccharide were released causing permeability 254 \ndecline (flat sheet, 0.4 \u03bcm) which was correlated to the elevated SMP polysaccharide 255 \nconcentration (Reid et al., 2006); the absence of elevated concentrations of secreted 256 \npolysaccharide in this current study may in part explain this disparity.  257 \n 258 \nTwenty PLFA fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES), identified by MS, principally 259 \ncomprised normal saturates and terminally branched saturates.  Trans-monoenoic fatty 260 \nacid concentrations were below the limit of detection. Dominant FAMES were C16:0, 261 \nC16:1, C17:0, C18, C18:1\u03c99c and C19:0cy at 50, 75 and 100 gNaCl.l-1 and accounted 262 \nfor c.95% of PLFAs detected (Table 2). Similar elution profiles (and the absence of 263 \ntrans-monoenoic fatty acids) were observed previously for a range of moderately and 264 \nextremely halophilic bacterium (Aston and Peyton, 2007; Yakimov et al., 2001). 265 \nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) showed three discrete data groupings 266 \ncorresponding to salt concentration (Figure 10). Analysis of variance of the principal 267 \ncomponents (PC) confirmed significant differences of P<0.001 and P<0.01 for 268 \nprincipal components PC1 and PC2 respectively. This distinction indicates abrupt 269 \nchanges in phenotypic profile between step changes in salinity.  270 \n 271 \n4. DISCUSSION 272 \n4.1 MBR Fouling 273 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n12 \n \nHigh polysaccharide transmission of c.81.5% was observed during steady state due to 274 \nthe production of low MW biopolymers and corresponded to a mean DOC removal of 275 \nc.44%. Low MW biopolymers are generally associated with substrate metabolism and 276 \nbiomass growth (Barker et al., 2000) and are produced in all MBR applications. Using 277 \nLC-OCD, Zhang et al. (2006) observed 99.8% high MW (c.250 kDa) and 93.6% low 278 \nMW (5 to 250 kDa) biopolymer rejection when using a 0.2 \u00b5m flat sheet membrane in 279 \nan MBR and cited polysaccharide as the major foulant. The authors suggested this 280 \nbehaviour to be a common trait of fouled MF membranes; improved retention of low 281 \nMW biopolymers (and higher dP\/dt) in their investigation may arise from more 282 \nsignificant internal deposition created by the larger pore size. In this study, 283 \nconcentration (accumulation) of low MW biopolymers in the bulk phase by permeate 284 \nrecirculation did not increase fouling propensity. This indicates that: (1) low MW 285 \nbiopolymers asserted poor aggregation potential upon recirculation and thus were not 286 \nfiltered; and (2) biopolymers exhibited limited binding potential to the membrane 287 \nsurface and any biofilm present. This contradicts previous experiences with 288 \npolysaccharides (Zhang et al., 2006; Frank and Belfort, 2003), however, past research 289 \nhas typically focused on high MW polysaccharides (100 to 1600 kDa) which possess 290 \nmore structural and functional complexity than those of lower MW biopolymers 291 \n(48.3% below 10 kDa) as in this study; higher MW structures may thus concentrate at 292 \nthe membrane surface by both size exclusion and surface adhesion (Frank and Belfort, 293 \n2003). 294 \n 295 \nFouling propensity was not greatly increased by salt shocking. The characteristic 296 \nresponse of non-halophilic micro-organisms exposed to salt upshock is to undergo 297 \nplasmolysis due to a loss in turgor pressure (Reid et al., 2006). This induces the 298 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n13 \n \nrelease of soluble cellular components through the cell membrane (Laspidou and 299 \nRittmann, 2002) and in some instances the subsequent release of cell wall components 300 \nsuch as acid mucopolysaccharides, resulting in high concentrations of proteins and 301 \npolysaccharides in the bulk phase (Reid et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2006). In this study, 302 \nonly protein was released, implying that cell lysis did not occur. Halophilic bacteria 303 \npossess modified highly negatively charged proteins on the external cell wall to 304 \nmediate osmotic shifts (Petrovic et al., 1999); the protein release observed may 305 \ntherefore have been an adjustment in cell wall composition (Russell, 1989). In 306 \naddition, cell wall modification may have initiated the floc destabilisation observed 307 \nupon upshocking causing indirect release of extracellular protein from the floc matrix 308 \nas postulated by Reid et al. (2006). The absence of secreted polysaccharide, structure 309 \nand size distribution of the organics produced by halophilic bacteria and the lower 310 \nmembrane pore size adopted in this investigation (0.04 \u00b5m, potentially limiting 311 \ninternal deposition) may explain the disparity in organics rejection and fouling 312 \ncompared to previous literature findings (Reid et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006). 313 \n 314 \n4.2 Microbial community and treatment performance 315 \nPLFA profiles were dominated by a small range of fatty acids that are common 316 \namongst halophiles (Aston and Peyton, 2007; Yakimov et al., 2001). The trans\/cis 317 \nratio was consistently <0.15 at all three salt concentrations indicating that the cell 318 \nmembrane remained stable - a ratio above 0.25 indicating instability (Aston and 319 \nPeyton, 2007) - further suggesting that plasmolysis did not occur. Transition of PLFA 320 \nprofiles at each salt increment indicated reordering of the membrane lipid 321 \ncomposition for osmoregulation (Russell, 1989; Pfl\u00fcger and Muller, 2004) and 322 \nmicrobial community restructuring (Forney et al., 2001) as described previously for 323 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n14 \n \nsalt upshocking of denitrifying halophiles (Yoshie et al., 2006). The decrease in 324 \nnitrate removal from 99.7% to between 58.6% and 73.6% may therefore be due to 325 \nmicrobial restructuring, however, lower specific bacterial growth rates have been 326 \nobserved at high salt concentrations. Peyton et al. (2001) established that Halomonas 327 \ncampisalis could effectively denitrify at 180 gNaCl.l-1 (Peyton et al., 2001), though 328 \nthe maximum specific growth rate for the monoculture was identified at c.30gNaCl.l-1 329 \n(Aston and Peyton, 2007). In this study, upon down shocking to 50gNaCl.l-1 330 \ndenitrification capacity recovered to 98.4% within 24 hours. This demonstrates that 331 \nwhilst transition in community structure occurred following salt upshocking, an 332 \neffective residual halotolerant denitrifying community remained following 333 \nperturbation; extension of SRT (>10 days) may be sufficient to offset the lower 334 \ngrowth rates observed at high salt concentrations.    335 \n 336 \n4.3 Resin operation 337 \nIt has been suggested that polysaccharides do not normally deposit easily onto aIEX 338 \nresin due to impeded diffusion (by size exclusion) and low contact times (Cornelissen 339 \net al., 2008). In this study, polysaccharides contacted the resin during regeneration 340 \nrather than exhaustion, thus increasing contact time by a factor of four. Adsorption of 341 \nexopolysaccharides to anionic resins is intuitive as their structure is principally 342 \npolyanionic due to the number of uronic acid or ketal linked pyruvate groups 343 \ncontained within the long chain high MW (500-2000 kDa) structures (Sutherland, 344 \n2001). However, based on the low affinity shown for desorption of polysaccharides in 345 \nthis study, it appears that the dominant adsorption mechanism associated with the 346 \nlower MW polysaccharides present in the brine is physical rather than exchange 347 \nbased. DOC uptake could not be quantified during exhaustion runs due to competition 348 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n15 \n \neffects with the influent DOC. Therefore, based on physical data, the theoretical 349 \ncharge density (approximated by normalising lost resin capacity with DOC uptake, 350 \nFigure 7) was c.3.9x10-4 meq.gDOC-1; this negligible result further demonstrates that 351 \nadsorption was not exchange based and indicates that the adsorbed organics exhibited 352 \na charge closer to neutrality. Kim and Symons (1991) postulated that physical 353 \nadsorption was more likely to occur at the resin skeleton. After the first regeneration 354 \nwith brinebt, physical adsorption reached a maximum, presumably due to the limited 355 \nnumber of adsorption sites available.  356 \n 357 \n5. CONCLUSIONS 358 \nA study of the denitrification of high salinity ion exchange brine regenerant and the 359 \nimpact of accumulation on process performance has demonstrated recycling for ion 360 \nexchange regeneration to be viable. 361 \n1. Whilst recirculation generated high concentrations of low MW organics, their 362 \nimpact on membrane permeability was negligible. 363 \n2. Although salt upshock induced protein release, the permeability decline was 364 \nminimal, contrary to previous studies based on non-halophilic communities. 365 \n3. Nitrate removal of c.99.7% was observed at steady-state (50 gNaCl.l-1); at salt 366 \nconcentrations above 50 gNaCl.l-1 nitrate removal decreased and the 367 \ncommunity profile was modified, though this could be countered by adoption 368 \nof a higher SRT to offset the lower growth rates.  369 \n4. Adsorption of the low MW organics generated during denitrification onto the 370 \nresin structure resulted in minimal loss in resin capacity, implying long-term 371 \noperation using recovered brine is possible. 372 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n16 \n \n5. Under halophilic conditions, addition of exogenous substrate must be 373 \ncontrolled to minimise breakthrough and to support complete denitrification 374 \n(limiting the preferential formation of nitrite). 375 \n6. The efficacy of the denitrification MBR process is closely related to 376 \nmembrane rejection and the structural and functional attributes of the resultant 377 \norganics; both the process operational determinants and the bacterial 378 \ncommunity generated may influence performance.  379 \n 380 \nAcknowledgements 381 \nThe authors would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research 382 \nCouncil (EPSRC), Anglian Water, Severn Trent Water and Yorkshire Water for their 383 \nfinancial support.  384 \n 385 \nREFERENCES 386 \nAston, J.E., Peyton, B.M.
