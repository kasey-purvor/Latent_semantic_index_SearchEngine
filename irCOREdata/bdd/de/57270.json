The third episode of lava dome growth at Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano, 15 \nMontserrat was characterised by higher average magma discharge rates than either 16 \nprevious dome growth episode at this volcano and yet fewer collapses. During 17 \nsustained dome growth at moderate-high average rates (>6 m3\/s), we identified 2-6 18 \nweek discharge pulses that supplied c.20 Mm3 magma from depth.

Cycles of c. 11-16 21 \ndays were evident in rockfall, LP rockfall and shallow LP earthquake counts related to 22 \ndome growth and degassing. We speculate that degassing at the conduit margins 23 \ntogether with stick-slip conduit flow may drive these cycles. Only one major collapse 24 \n>10 Mm3 occurred during the third episode (on May 20, 2006) as a new magma pulse 25 \nentered the dome and coincided with heavy rainfall. 26 \n27 \n1. Introduction  28 \nThe ongoing eruption of the andesitic Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (SHV) began in 1995 29 \nand up until April 2008 there had been three 2-3 year long episodes of lava dome 30 \ngrowth. During the third episode, there were higher average discharge rates (~5.6 31 \nm3\/s) than either previous dome growth episode [Ryan et al., 2010], yet there were 32 \nfewer dome collapses. There were also fewer hybrid earthquakes and the 20 May 33 \n2006 dome collapse had no hybrid precursors [Luckett et al., 2008].  34 \nRecognising cycles as the magmatic system evolves and understanding what controls 35 \nthem is critical if scientists are to effectively forecast eruptive activity. We identify 36 \ncyclic activity on various scales from minutes to months based mainly on 37 \nobservational data and seismic data (rockfall counts) and test these against existing 38 \nmodels. Our paper provides an overview of the third episode of dome growth in terms 39 \nof observed extrusion cycles, related seismicity and dome collapses. The implications 40 \nfor magma supply and volcanic hazards are discussed. 41 \n42 \n2. Previous cyclic activity and dome growth at SHV 43 \nModelling the dynamics of magma flow in conduits has shown that periodic 44 \nbehaviour over weeks to years is to be expected as a result of non-linear processes 45 \nrelated to degassing, gas exsolution, pressurisation and rheological stiffening in the 46 \nshallow conduit [eg Melnik and Sparks, 2002, 2005; Costa et al., 2007].  47 \nVoight et al. [1998] described short cycles in 1997 defined by tilt, seismicity and 48 \neruptive activity over periods of 4 to 36 hours. They were explained by pressurisation 49 \nin the upper conduit related to non-linear dynamics of magma flow with stick-slip 50 \nflow [e.g. Denlinger and Hoblitt, 1999; Voight et al., 1999; Wylie et al., 1999]. 51 \nEruptive cycles over 6-7 weeks were recognised in 1997 and were commonly 52 \nassociated with major dome collapses (Sparks & Young, 2002; Watts et al., 2002). 53 \nWatts et al. (2002) demonstrated how fluctuating discharge rates during these pulses 54 \nrelated to emplacement of specific features in the dome. High discharge rates (>7 55 \nm3\/s) resulted in fluid lava capable of axisymmetric lateral spreading (\u2018pancake\u2019 56 \nlobes), moderate rates (2-7 m3\/s) in the formation of shear lobes, and low rates (<2 57 \nm3\/s) resulted in the formation of spines and megaspines. Costa et al. [2007] 58 \nexplained these 6-7 week cycles by modelling magma flow through an ellipsoidal 59 \ndyke in an elastic medium extending from a magma chamber at a depth of 5 km to 60 \nwithin ~1 km of the surface where there is a smooth transition to a cylindrical conduit  61 \n(assuming constant source pressure).    62 \n63 \n3. Monitoring data and methods 64 \nWe use seismic data from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) broadband 65 \nnetwork [Luckett et al., 2008] and photographs of the dome taken every minute by 66 \nfixed cameras at Perches Mountain 1 km to the SE and Windy Hill 3 km to the N (Fig. 67 \n1) to identify cyclic activity. Dome volumes were calculated using photo methods 68 \n[Ryan et al., 2010] and ground-based LiDAR [Jones, 2006]. All volumes and 69 \ndischarge rates are dense rock equivalent (DRE) as calculated by Sparks et al. [1998] 70 \nand Ryan et al. [2010]. All times are local.  71 \n72 \n4. Cycles of lava dome growth 73 \nBased mainly on evidence from time-lapse photographs, helicopter photographs and 74 \nother observations, we identified 15 dome growth stages including 9 major 2-6 week 75 \npulses in discharge rate (Table 1). The onset of each major pulse was characterised by 76 \na switch in extrusion direction, a sudden increase in discharge rate and emplacement 77 \nof a new feature (eg shear lobe, megaspine or pancake lobe). Discharge rates declined 78 \ntowards the end of each cycle.  79 \nThe first growth stage began on August 1, 2005 and was characterised by average 80 \ndischarge rates increasing to 4 m3\/s in January 2006 [Ryan et al., 2010]. By January 81 \n27, 2006, 23 Mm3 of magma had been discharged [Ryan et al., 2010] and the dome 82 \nhad a height of 170m. On  February 9, very vigorous ash venting and degassing from 83 \na single vent marked the onset of a major eruptive pulse (growth stage 2). From 84 \nFebruary 10, fluid lava was discharged at high average rates (>15 m3\/s) forming a 85 \nflat-topped pancake lobe that raised the dome height by over 50 m. Subsequent major 86 \npulses (growth stages 3-5) comprised emplacement of subvertical shear lobes and 87 \nmegaspines at average rates >6 m3\/s. Following a total dome collapse on May 20, 88 \n2006 when the dome had reached a height of 328m, dome growth resumed almost 89 \nimmediately. Very vigorous ash and gas venting on August 31 preceded another pulse 90 \nof fluid lava (growth stage 6) at high discharge rates. Later pulses were again 91 \ndominated by subvertical shear lobes and megaspines (Table 1). 92 \nDome growth ended on April 4, 2007, leaving a dome of volume 203 Mm3 (non-93 \nDRE) and height ~ 370m [Ryan et al., 2010]. 94 \n95 \n5. Seismic characteristics  96 \nRockfalls, long period (LP) rockfalls and LP earthquake signals dominated dome 97 \ngrowth seismicity [Luckett et al., 2008]. LP rockfall signals are thought to be caused 98 \nby violent degassing at the surface of the dome that triggers a nearby rockfall [Luckett 99 \net al., 2002, 2008]. LP earthquakes are interpreted as pressurisation in the conduit.  100 \nThere was a steady increase in cumulative rockfall energy from February until early 101 \nMay 2006 (Fig. 2). On May 6, the extrusion direction switched to the southwest, 102 \nwhere runout length is restricted by the crater wall. The May 20, 2006 and January 8, 103 \n2007 dome collapses both followed a switch from southwest to northerly extrusion.  104 \nCycles in seismic data were on a time scale of days and were therefore independent of 105 \nthe 2-6 week cycles in discharge rate. A 10-11 day rockfall periodicity was evident 106 \nfrom February 1 2006 until June 4 2006 (Fig. 3). These cycles broke down (and 107 \ncounts reached low levels) on June 8, 2006. Similarly, from July 1 2006, a c.16 day 108 \ncycle began from August 29 to January 2007 (Fig. 2).  109 \nThe relationship between extrusion rates and rockfall counts is not straightforward 110 \n(e.g. Ryan et al., 2010) and depends on dome morphology and the location of lava 111 \nextrusion. For example, there may be a short lag between the onset of high extrusion 112 \nrates at the summit and increased rockfall activity (e.g. April 5-7, 2006; Wadge et al., 113 \n2008).    114 \n115 \n6. Dome collapses 116 \nDome collapses typically took place during or soon after the sudden onset of a 2-6 117 \nweek pulse in discharge rate and change in extrusion direction. 118 \n6.1 May 20, 2006 119 \nA pulse began on May 20 2006 and at 05:52, a large LP earthquake immediately 120 \npreceded the start of the collapse and occurred at the peak of rainfall intensity on 121 \nGaribaldi Hill (Fig.1). The seismograms from five seismic stations show a prolonged 122 \nbuildup to the collapse lasting c. 90 minutes, two marked peaks including high and 123 \nlow frequency signals, followed by a rapid decline over c. 30 minutes (Fig. 4). The 124 \ncollapse intensified at 07:32. Two sharp low amplitude\/high energy release signals at 125 \n07.36 and 07.43 are interpreted as vertical explosions that resulted in observed 126 \nshowers of lithic and rare pumice fragments (<5%) over northern parts of the island 127 \n(<6 cm at Olveston). Surges swept up to 3 km northwards from Tar River delta 128 \nreaching Spanish Point and White\u2019s Yard in a similar manner to the 2003 collapse 129 \n[Edmonds and Herd, 2005].  130 \nThe total collapse volume was 97 Mm3 , comprising 85.2 Mm3 dome and talus 131 \nmeasured on May 18, 0.7 Mm3 lava extruded between 18-20 May (assuming average 132 \ndischarge rates, Ryan et al., 2010), and 11 Mm3 older dome and talus remnants. The 133 \ncollapse resulted in the rapid release of c. 200 ktons of SO2 into the stratosphere 134 \n[Prata et al., 2006; Carn et al., 2006]. There was a gas-to-collapse-volume ratio of 135 \n~2.0 kt SO2 per Mm3 collapsed material. This compares to ~0.4kt SO2 per Mm3 136 \ncollapsed material at previous dome collapses [Edmonds et al., 2003].  137 \n138 \n6.2 June 30, 2006 139 \nTwo swarms of small LP earthquakes occurred June 25-27 and June 29-30, 140 \naccompanied by frequent rockfalls. The second swarm culminated in a partial dome 141 \ncollapse into Tar River valley.  The collapse started at 12:51 LT and pyroclastic flows 142 \nreached the sea at 12:58. It lasted just 18 minutes and removed ~2 Mm3  andesite from 143 \nthe dome.  144 \n6.3 January 8, 2007 145 \nA switch in discharge direction began on December 24, 2006, with vigorous ash 146 \nventing and dome-collapse pyroclastic flows 200-300 m down Tyer\u2019s Ghaut (Fig. 1). 147 \nThere was vigorous ash venting from 05:30 on January 8, followed by three audible 148 \nexplosive pulses at 06:04-06:05, 06:05-06:10 and 06:15, the last of which coincided 149 \nwith the largest pyroclastic flow [De Angelis et al., 2007], which travelled c. 5.5 km 150 \ndown the Belham Valley reaching Cork Hill for the first time since September 1997. 151 \nFlows also travelled down Paradise River to Harris and surges swept across Farrells to 152 \nStreatham and Harris. Flows included dense andesite and pumice (much more pumice 153 \nthan May 20, 2006) consistent with rapid decompression of the freshly emplaced lobe 154 \ninterior. The ash plume rose to c. 10 km. Subsequently, activity continued with 155 \npyroclastic flows of 1.5 km runout every 5-7 minutes for the next 90 minutes. Each 156 \nflow was preceded by a small pulse of ash venting. Melt inclusions in pumice from 157 \nthis collapse contain 6.2 wt% H2O [Humphreys et al., 2009] significantly higher than 158 \nprevious analyses (4.5 wt% H2O, Barclay et al., 1998) and suggests magma storage at 159 \nhigh pressures. 160 \n161 \n7. Discussion 162 \nThe volume of magma erupted during 2005-7 was similar to that in 1995-8 but it was 163 \ndischarged at higher average rates [Ryan et al., 2009]. Emplacement of fluid pancake 164 \nlobes accompanied by vigorous degassing was more common, implying these pulses 165 \nhad high magma ascent rates and limited degassing-induced crystallisation. 166 \nSubsequent pulses produced megaspines or shear lobes characterised by extensive 167 \ndegassing-induced crystallisation. Such significant changes in the magma dynamics 168 \ncan be explained by slight changes in a single parameter such as volatile content [eg 169 \nMelnik and Sparks, 2005].  170 \nThe 2-6 week pulses identified here on the basis of extrusion morphologies and 171 \ndischarge rates are probably equivalent to 6-7 week cycles defined by tilt, hybrid 172 \nearthquake swarms and eruptive activity in 1997 [Sparks and Young, 2002]. In 1997, 173 \neach pulse produced an average volume of ~30 Mm3, whereas these shorter pulses 174 \nproduced on average 20 Mm3. We speculate that some threshold excess pressure 175 \nnecessary for extrusion of the pulses is now lower. Assuming that total magma 176 \nchamber pressure remained constant and the magma retains more gas relative to 177 \nprevious episodes due to rapid ascent, it would be less dense and therefore more 178 \noverpressured near the chamber top. Rapid ascent would inhibit gas separation and 179 \nmost degassing would then occur nearer the surface. Many dome samples are 180 \nvesicular implying high gas contents on extrusion. Most pulses were capable of 181 \nraising the dome height by c.50 m, suggesting a roughly constant excess pressure of 182 \nabout 1.5 MPa (assuming a lava density of 2400 kgm-3)  that must build up before 183 \neach pulse is released. Costa et al., [2007] stated that the periodicity of flow through a 184 \ndyke depends on parameters such as influx rate and aspect ratio of the dyke, with 185 \nperiodicity typically decreasing with larger aspect ratios. This is consistent with lower 186 \nexcess pressures and a subsequently thinner dyke.  187 \nThe periodicity in shallow LP earthquakes, LP rockfalls and rockfall counts every 11-188 \n16 days must relate to a regular and pulsatory supply of gas into the dome during 189 \ngrowth. Based on average discharge rates [Ryan et al., 2010] each 11-16 day cycle 190 \nrelates to the flux of c. 6-11 Mm3 lava through the conduit system. Cycles over 191 \nseveral days are more likely to be controlled by processes in the conduit than the 192 \ndome, possibly related to shear at the conduit margins where gas separation can occur 193 \nand there is possible stick-slip flow. Shorter pulsations in pyroclastic flow activity (eg 194 \n5-7 minutes on 8 January 2007) appeared to relate to explosive activity.  195 \nThe onset of a pulse in discharge rate combined with a change in extrusion direction 196 \nraises the likelihood of a dome collapse as observed early in the eruption (Calder et 197 \nal., 2002). On May 20, 2006 heavy rainfall coincided with the pulse onset and a 10-11 198 \nday peak in rockfall activity (degassing) was due. The high SO2 release during the 199 \nMay 20, 2006 dome collapse may be attributed to a higher porosity in the dome than 200 \npreviously. Loading by the dome may also have closed the fractures in the conduit 201 \nwall inducing storage in the upper conduit [eg Taisne & Jaupart, 2008]. Alternatively, 202 \nthere may have been an unusually large mass of SO2 associated with the new magma 203 \npulse.  204 \n205 \nAcknowledgements 206 \nWe thank staff and volunteers at the MVO for technical assistance and support 207 \nthroughout the eruption period.
