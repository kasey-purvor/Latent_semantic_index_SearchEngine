Yet, terrorists from some \ncountries are much more likely to attack American citizens than terrorists from other \ncountries. Similarly, anti-American terrorism from a specific foreign country is much \nmore prevalent during certain periods than others. This article develops a rational theory \nof international terrorism, which argues that attacking foreign nationals is of strategic \nvalue to terrorists even if they ultimately aim at gaining political influence in their home \ncountry. Attacking foreigners is the more attractive to domestic terrorists the more the \nterrorists\u2019 home government depends on military support from the foreign country. \nApplied to the US case, our theory predicts that more anti-American terrorism emanates \nfrom countries that receive more US military aid and arms transfers and in which more \nAmerican military personnel are stationed, all relative to the country\u2019s own military \ncapacity. Estimations from a directed country dyad sample over the period 1978 to 2005 \nsupport the predictions of our theory for both terrorist incidents involving Americans \nand terrorist killings of Americans as dependent variables. These results are robust to a \nwide range of changes to the empirical research design.  \n2 \n1.  Introduction \nMost terrorism is domestic and, not surprisingly, the victims of most attacks share their \nnationality with the terrorists. However, US citizens are major victims of international \nterrorism. Even before 09\/11, at least 500 US citizens died in terrorist attacks conducted \nby non-US terrorists from at least 37 different countries. In this article we develop and \nempirically test the hypothesis that one important cause of anti-American terrorism is \nUS military support to foreign countries whose governments are in conflict with \nterrorists. We augment existing rational explanations of terrorism and develop a theory \nof international terrorism in general and of foreign terror on Americans in particular, \nclearly specifying the conditions under which one would expect more anti-American \nterrorism to emanate from some countries than others.1 \nIn line with rational explanations of terrorism (Crenshaw, 1981, 2001; Pape, \n2003, 2005; Kydd & Walter, 2006), we assume that terror groups want to gain a \nsignificant political influence on their country of origin or the broader region. \nAccordingly, terror groups are typically conflict with the government of their home \ncountry. They attack foreign targets if they gain a strategic advantage or peer support \nfrom doing so. We explain the strategic logic of attacking foreigners by the degree to \nwhich foreign powers militarily support the government in the terrorists\u2019 home country. \nThe US is the world\u2019s leading arms exporter, provider of military aid and it \nmaintains military personnel in numerous countries around the globe. Yet, at the same \n                                     \n1\n  Our theory is of course not exhaustive. We do not claim that it can explain all \ninternational or anti-American terrorism. We use the term \u201canti-American terrorism\u201d as a \nshortcut for terrorist attacks on Americans. \n3 \ntime it is also highly selective in who receives military support and how much. We \nargue that more anti-American terrorism comes from countries whose governments \ndepend more on US military support. Accordingly, our theory predicts that more \nterrorist attacks are plotted against Americans from countries, which receive more US \nmilitary aid and weapons and host more military personnel, all relative to their own \nmilitary strength. \nWe test this hypothesis with a directed dyadic dataset of American deaths caused \nby foreign terrorists as well as terrorist incidents involving Americans, covering the \nperiod between 1978 and 2005 using dyadic information which identifies the origins of \nanti-American terrorism. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop a research \ndesign that goes beyond an aggregate time-series analysis of anti-American terrorism \nand which allows us to address both the temporal and the much larger spatial variation \nin attacks on American citizens. Empirical findings provide ample support for the \nhypothesis derived from our theory. \n \n2.  Rational Explanations of International Terrorism  \nMost rational theories of terrorism assume that terror groups do not regard terrorist \nattacks as an end in itself. Rather, terrorist attacks are instruments used by (radical) \npolitical groups which pursue goals and follow strategies (Fromkin, 1975; Crenshaw, \n1981, 2001; Pape, 2003, 2005). Five goals have been associated with terror groups of all \nkinds by Kydd & Walter (2006: 52): regime change, territorial change, policy change, \nsocial control, and status quo maintenance. Without loss of generality, one can \nsummarize these goals under one umbrella notion: terror groups ultimately strive for \ngaining political influence, power and control in their home country or wider region. \n4 \nBut, of course, not all extremist groups with such goals conduct terror acts. Why do \nterror groups engage in terror rather than peaceful political action? The reason is that the \nterrorist home country does not allow peaceful political participation (e.g. because it is \nautocratic) or the goals of the terror groups are too unpopular to gain much support from \nthe population, or both (Enders and Sandler, 2006b). Either way, non-violent political \nchange is not an option.  \nTerror groups thus clash with the government of their home country. But it is an \nasymmetric conflict, in which the weaker conflict party, the radical group, uses the age-\nold weapon of the weak and powerless, terrorism to exert pressure on the stronger \nconflict party (Pape, 2005). Taken together, only if three conditions simultaneously \napply, will political groups be likely to use terrorist means: first, the group has radical \npolitical goals, which, second, puts it in conflict with the government and, third, the \ngroup cannot achieve its goals by either legal means or by an open armed challenge on \nthe government. Terrorism, then, can be understood as the attempt of a weaker party in \na conflict over political goals to coerce the stronger conflict party to succumb to its \ngoals. If, in comparison, the government and the radical group have similar policy \npreferences, no conflict emerges; if they have conflicting goals, but similar strengths, \nthen the leaders of an anti-government group are likely to form a guerilla group and can \ndirectly confront the government in a civil war.  \nThis rational logic behind terrorism does not explain, however, why terror \ngroups attack targets from other countries in general and from the US in particular. Yet, \nthree main factors explain why terrorists can benefit from attacking Americans: \nopportunity, necessity and strategic value. The omni-presence of Western tourists, \nbusiness people, diplomats as well as commercial outlets across the world renders \n5 \nattacking Westerners relatively easy and no other country is as prominently represented \nin foreign countries as America (Pillar, 2001). Li & Schaub (2004) argue that economic \nglobalization tremendously increases such opportunity. \nSobek & Braithwaite (2005) develop the necessity argument for anti-American \nterrorism. They state that if radical political groups \u2013 \u2018revisionist actors\u2019 as they call \nthem \u2013 want to challenge the status quo then they have to confront American dominance \nin the world. Given their relative weakness, they need to resort to terrorism, the weapon \nof the weak. Greater American dominance in the world means that the revisionist actors \n\u2018experience a limitation in their ability to effectively alter the status quo\u2019, which \u2018will \nthus likely lead them to more often choose terrorism over alternative actions\u2019 (Sobek & \nBraithwaite, 2005: 139f.). Terrorists then target America and Americans because the US \nhas the greatest interest and is most active in maintaining the status quo. \nThe strategic value of attacking Americans is highlighted by Crenshaw (2001) as \nan answer to \u2018Why America?\u2019 In her view, not the extent of American dominance in the \nworld as such matters, but the specific decisions the US makes in choosing and \nsupporting allies. She argues that the US \u2018has been susceptible to international terrorism \nprimarily because of its engagement on the world scene and its choice of allies. \nExtremist groups in countries around the world have targeted United States interests in \nan effort to achieve radical political change at home\u2019 (Crenshaw, 2001: 432). Attacking \nAmericans is of strategic value to terrorists because they hope that America will retreat \nif hit hard enough, which would facilitate the terrorists\u2019 political struggle at home. \nIn sum, rational explanations regard anti-American terrorism as the consequence \nof easy opportunity, as a political necessity due to the asymmetry in power between \nweak terrorist groups and the most powerful country in the world, or as a strategic \n6 \nchoice due to the value that attacking Americans has for the terrorists\u2019 campaign at \nhome.  \nYet, not all rational explanations equally account for why America is targeted \nmore than other (Western) countries and why terrorists from certain countries attack \nAmericans much more than terrorists from other countries. The opportunity argument \nfails to explain why other Westerners, which are after all not much less present in for-\neign countries than Americans, become significantly less victimized by foreign \nterrorists even if we correct for population size. This argument also provides no \nsatisfactory motivation for terrorists to kill foreigners. Westerners and Americans are \nnot just attacked because of their mere presence and availability. Neither do Americans \nbecome the victims of terrorists simply out of necessity. Whilst America is far more \npowerful than any radical political group, so are many other countries in the world. \nThus, asymmetry in power constitutes a necessary but not a sufficient condition for \nterrorism. A rational theory of anti-American terrorism needs to explain how and why \nterrorists gain strategically from attacking US citizens and why terrorists of some \ncountries gain more so than terrorists from other countries. \nIn the remainder of this article, we will develop the idea of Crenshaw (2001) and \nothers further and we will argue that the strategic value to terrorists from attacking \nAmericans is a function of the extent to which foreign governments depend on \nAmerican military support. The greater American military support relative to domestic \nmilitary capacity, the more America represents an effective brake on the terrorists\u2019 goal \nof achieving political influence, power and control in their home country and the higher \nthe strategic value from attacking Americans. \n \n7 \n3. A Strategic Theory of International Terrorism  \nIn this section, we develop a theory of international terrorism, which we then apply to \nthe US case. The main purpose of the first step is to explain the benefit domestic \nterrorists derive from attacking foreign targets. In the second step, we show how the \nstrategic logic of international terrorism renders radical groups from some countries \nrather than others more likely to target Americans. \n3.1. The Strategic Interests of Terrorists \nOur theory firmly roots within the rational explanation of international terrorism. We \nthus assume that terrorism serves as an instrument used by radical political groups \nwhich aim at gaining influence on important policies and political control in their home \ncountry (or wider region). We will show that under certain identifiable conditions \nattacking foreign targets is in the strategic interest of the terror group. \nThree distinctions are important for the development of our argument. First, we \ndistinguish between three types of actors: the terrorist group, the government of the \nterrorists\u2019 home country, with which the group is in conflict, and the foreign govern-\nment, which interferes in the domestic conflict on the side of the home government. \nThis distinction allows us to ultimately relate terrorist attacks on foreign citizens to a \npolitical conflict between the terror group and its government \u2013 a conflict in which the \nforeign power takes side. Accordingly, we argue that international terrorism emanates \nfrom the foreign country\u2019s influence on the domestic politics in the terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry \u2013 and not from a given conflict between the terror group and the foreign nation \nper se.  \n8 \nSecond, we distinguish between the leaders of the terror organization, the terror \nentrepreneurs (Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2008), and their footmen, the terror agents. \nTerror entrepreneurs have a crucial, decisive position in the terror organization. They \nare the group\u2019s leaders and behave predominantly strategically. From their perspective, \nterrorism is a rational strategy in a political struggle to achieve an end, not an end in \nitself. Terror agents, on the other hand, are attracted by the entrepreneurs\u2019 ideology, but \ndo not hold a decisive or crucial position within the terror organization. Rather, they \nserve as footmen of the entrepreneurs and follow specified or unspecified commands, \nwhich may include the command of self-sacrifice in a suicide terror mission. Contrary \nto terror entrepreneurs, terror agents need not behave predominantly strategically or \nrationally. They may be driven by several, complex and varied motivations that may \nalso depend on the contextual and sometimes very personal circumstances (Victoroff, \n2005). This second distinction thus allows us to leave many discussions in the literature \non terrorism aside \u2013 for example, the one on how \u2018rational\u2019 suicide terrorists are (Fer-\nrero, 2006). A rational theory of terrorism focuses on the terror entrepreneurs, not their \nagents, since they, not the agents, decide when, where and against whom terror attacks \nare executed. \nOur third and final crucial distinction is that between the ultimate goals of terror \ngroups on the one hand and intermediate strategic goals on the other hand. We argue \nthat the ultimate goal of terror entrepreneurs is to gain political influence, power and \ncontrol in their own country or wider region. Yet, most terror groups cannot reach their \nultimate goals within the foreseeable future. For this reason, they aim at achieving \nintermediate strategic goals. In one way or the other, these goals all entail either a \n9 \nweakening of the government, against which the terrorists fight, or a strengthening of \ntheir own organization. \nTerror groups can win a strategic advantage over the government in numerous \nways. For example, the terrorists can kill important government representatives. Killing \ninnocent individuals and bystanders can be equally beneficial to the terrorists, however, \nif this raises sufficient media attention and causes the government to respond heavy-\nhandedly. The media attention becomes important since terrorists need access to a large \naudience in order to increase support by like-minded individuals and recruit new agents. \nA harsh government response has an ambiguous effect on the strength of the terror \norganization since governmental crackdowns impose costs on the group. At the same \ntime, however, such crackdowns can also be beneficial to the terrorists if they are \nperceived as over-reactions and lead to the restriction of individual freedoms and \nincreased costs for all citizens or particular groups of the population, which lowers the \ngovernment\u2019s popularity. More importantly, perhaps, a harsh anti-terror response by the \ngovernment may infuriate the terror group\u2019s actual and potential supporters, which \ndrives out more moderate voices and helps recruiting terror agents (Rosendorff & \nSandler, 2004; Richardson, 2006).2 It also facilitates gaining shelter and gathering \nresources from those willing to support the terror group.  \nYet, this explanation of the strategic interests of terror organizations does not \naccount for why these groups at times choose to attack foreigners. Since terror \nentrepreneurs ultimately aim at changing the political system or important policies of \n                                     \n2\n  See Rosendorff & Sandler (2004); Bueno de Mesquita (2005a, b, 2007), Bueno de \nMesquita & Dickson (2007) and Powell (2007) for formal modeling of governmental \ncounter-terrorism. \n10 \ntheir home country, one may even wonder why terrorists attack foreigners at all. It is to \nthe strategic value of attacking foreign targets to which we now turn. \n3.2. The Strategic Value of Attacking Foreign Targets \nOur micro-foundation of terrorism provides important insights to the logic of \ninternational terrorism, suggesting at least three reasons why attacking foreigners may \nbecome a utility-maximizing strategy for terror organizations. First, the nationality of \nterror victims has a major impact on the extent of media attention. With global news \nnetworks dominated by Western countries, it is attractive for any terror entrepreneur \nanywhere in the world to inflict terror on nationals of Western countries as this is a sure \nway of getting into global news. The media attention enables the terrorists to spread \ntheir ideology more easily. Thus, a successful attack on foreigners from some countries \nhas a higher strategic value for terror entrepreneurs than a similarly successful attack on \nforeigners from another country or on domestic citizens.  \nSecond, attacking foreigners rather than domestic citizens may result in higher \npeer acknowledgement for the terror group. This will be particularly the case if the \nforeign citizens come from countries that are hated by the terrorists\u2019 potential \nsupporters. Attacking civilians is difficult to justify in the eyes of most people, even \nthose sympathetic to the terror entrepreneurs\u2019 goals. Yet, nationals from detested \nforeign countries can be more easily de-humanized as infidels, suppressors, exploiters \nand the like.  \nThird, and most importantly, some governments owe their survival partly to the \nsupport of foreign countries, which may heavily influence the government\u2019s policies \nand may induce it to take immensely unpopular measures, heightening the conflict with \nthe domestic terrorists. Accordingly, the probability of terror groups reaching their \n11 \nultimate goal may depend on the amount of political and especially military support the \ndomestic government receives from abroad. Foreign powers can, for example, station \ntroops in the terrorists\u2019 home country, provide military aid, arms, military training, \npolitical and economic support. Thus, if foreign powers make it less likely for the terror \ngroup to achieve its goals, an attack on foreign citizens can maximize the strategic \nadvantage of the terror group. By directly targeting the foreign supporter of the home \ngovernment, the terror entrepreneurs hope to trigger a decline in foreign support for the \nhome government or even its complete withdrawal. \nOf the diverse forms in which foreign powers can bolster embattled gov-\nernments, military support is the one most relevant and most visible to the terrorists.3 \nMilitary aid, arms and training directly strengthen the government side in its struggle \nwith the terrorists, putting the terrorists at a disadvantage compared to the situation \nwithout foreign military support. Military personnel of the foreign power may actively \nengage in counter-terrorist actions. Even where they do not, they help the government \nby releasing its own military personnel from some of its duties, thus lowering the \nopportunity costs of counter-terrorist action. \n                                     \n3\n  This is not to say that political and economic foreign support may not also play a role in \ninternational terrorism. We concentrate here on military support as the form of assistance \ndirectly relevant to the terrorists\u2019 violent struggle with the domestic government, leaving \nan analysis of other forms of support by the foreign power to future research. It is also \nworth noting that military aid is probably less fungible than general economic aid. \n12 \n3.3.  US Military Support, Anti-American Terrorism and the Terrorists\u2019 Countries of \nOrigin \nThe logic of international terrorism discussed above can be applied straightforwardly to \nmake predictions on the countries of origin from which terrorists come who conduct \nterror attacks on US targets. Our theory posits that anti-American terrorism more likely \noriginates from countries in which US military support has the largest effect on the \nmilitary capacity of the government receiving this support. \nMore governments borrow their military strength from the US than from any \nother country. Yet, the US is also highly selective in deciding which foreign \ngovernments receive military support. It supports some countries but not others. In turn, \nsome countries and their governments depend much more on US military support than \nothers.  \nMilitary support can take many different forms. Military aid and arms exports \nbuttress the military capacity of a country\u2019s government. While Israel, Egypt, Turkey, \nGreece and Pakistan are among the largest recipient countries of US military aid during \nour period of study in both absolute and relative terms, several Central American \nbeneficiaries also rank prominently among the countries receiving a significant US \ncontribution relative to their total military expenditures. The North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) partners, Japan, Egypt, Israel, and Saudi-Arabia receive the \nlargest amount of US arms exports. If we standardize arms imports by a country\u2019s \ndomestic military expenditures, however, we find that US arms transfers are most \nimportant for some Arab countries like Egypt, Bahrain and Jordan. Another form of \nmilitary support to foreign governments occurs when the US stations its own military \npersonnel in the country. US military bases are spread all over the world. In absolute \n13 \nnumbers most US overseas troops are stationed in some of the NATO countries, South \nKorea, Japan, and the Philippines, which reflects the past American geo-political \ninterest in containing communism. If we disregard NATO countries and the troops \ncurrently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan, then Panama, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Hondu-\nras host the largest ratio of US troops relative to their own troops during our study \nperiod. \nThe flipside of this military support for foreign countries is that the more im-\nportant US support becomes for the stability of the terrorists\u2019 home government, the \nmore attractive to terrorists become attacks on US targets. In countries largely \ndependent on US military support, not only the military strength of the home \ngovernment frustrates the terrorists\u2019 bid for political influence, power and control, but \nalso the extent to which the US allows the home government to borrow from its much \nlarger military strength. \nIn targeting Americans, the terrorists attempt to drive a wedge between the home \ngovernment and its foreign supporter. Thereby, they seek to increase the costs for the \nUS beyond the gains the US derives from supporting the government. If they manage to \nachieve this goal, the terror attacks may ultimately cause a withdrawal of US troops and \na significant reduction in US arms exports and military aid. This would destabilize the \ngovernment the US had supported. \nThe terrorists derive succor from, admittedly highly selective, past experience. \nThe suicide attacks on US marine barracks in October 1983, for example, which killed \n14 \n241 Americans, made the US withdraw its troops from Lebanon.4 Osama bin Laden has \nrepeatedly professed his conviction that the US and its soldiers are cowards who will \ngive in if only hit hard and long enough (Al Qaeda, 2006a, b). Rightly or wrongly, Al \nQaeda leaders believe that their terror campaigns will ultimately induce the US to \nwithdraw from the Middle East and that this would enable Al Qaeda and like-minded \ngroups to expand their political influence and, perhaps, even allow them to take control \nof pivotal countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Posen, 2001\/02). \nIn sum, our theory predicts that groups from countries whose government de-\npends on US military support are most likely to conduct terror on Americans. Our \ntestable hypothesis is that a foreign government\u2019s greater dependence on US military \naid, arms exports, and military personnel significantly increases attacks by terrorists of \nthis foreign country on US citizens. In the remainder, we put this hypothesis to an \nempirical test, starting with a discussion of the research design. \n \n4. Research Design \nEmpirically, social scientists can address the special case of anti-American terrorism \nfrom two different perspectives: First, time-series analyses of terrorist attacks on US \ntargets identify the peaks in the number of terrorist attacks on Americans and their \ncorrelates. For example, Sobek and Braithwaite (2005) find that the total aggregate sum \nof all terror attacks against US targets is a function of overall American political and \n                                     \n4\n  This was openly admitted to by the late President Ronald Reagan in his memoirs: \u2018The \nprice we had to pay in Beirut was so great, the tragedy at the barracks was so enormous\u2026 \nWe had to pull out.\u2019 (cited in Pape, 2005: 55). \n15 \nmilitary dominance in the world. Second, a (pooled) time-series cross-sectional dyadic \nanalysis with terrorist attacks on Americans as the dependent variable identifies the \nconditions determining the large variation in anti-American terrorism both across time \nand, more importantly, across terrorists\u2019 countries of origin. It is only this latter \nperspective, which we adopt here, which sheds light on the causes of anti-American \nterrorism. This is because while such terrorism is widespread across the world, there are \nalso clear and stark differences in its extent across terrorists\u2019 countries of origin. In fact, \nany analysis of anti-American terrorism needs to tackle the fact that, even excluding the \n9\/11 attacks, terrorists from only ten countries account for roughly 80 per cent of all \nAmerican casualties and that the top ten countries of anti-American terrorism in terms \nof terrorist incidents account for roughly half of all terrorist acts.5 \n4.1 The Dependent Variables \nTerrorism is notoriously difficult to measure because clear-cut definitions that allow \ndistinguishing terrorism from guerrilla warfare on the one hand (Sambanis 2008) and \nterrorism from ordinary crime on the other do not exist. We use data from the \n\u2018International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events\u2019 (Iterate) dataset (Mickolus et \nal., 2003), which defines terrorism as \u2018the use, or threat of use, of anxiety-inducing, \nextra-normal violence for political purposes by any individual or group, whether acting \nfor or in opposition to established governmental authority, when such action is intended \n                                     \n5\n  According to our data, the top 10 countries in terms of anti-American terrorist incidents \nare Colombia, the Philippines, Greece, Turkey, El Salvador, Lebanon, Peru, Iran, \nGermany and Pakistan. In terms of terrorist killings of US citizens, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, \nEgypt and Jordan enter the group, while Greece, Peru, Iran and Germany drop out. \n16 \nto influence the attitudes and behavior of a target group wider than the immediate \nvictims\u2019 (ibid.: 2). Terrorist violence includes as diverse incidents as, among others, as-\nsassinations, bombings and armed attacks, arson and fire, kidnapping, and skyjacking. \nHowever, ordinary crime and violence for purposes other than political are explicitly \nexcluded. Violence committed during international and civil wars is not coded as \nterrorism either. Consequently, guerrilla attacks by rebel groups remain uncounted, \nunless they target civilians or the dependents of military personnel (Mickolus, Sandler \n& Murdock, 1989: xii). Thus, Iterate excludes terror attacks against US soldiers in Iraq, \nbut includes attacks against American civil workers (Enders & Sandler, 2006a: 372). \nIterate provides information on whether US citizens have been victimized or \neven killed in terror attacks. To create a directed country dyadic dependent variable we \nuse information on the nationality of the terrorists (the first nationality of terrorists in \ncase more than one nationality is involved). We employ two dependent variables. One is \nthe annual sum of US citizens killed by terrorists, the other one the annual sum of all \nterrorist incidents that victimized US citizens. The location of the terror incident as such \ndoes not matter. Thus, terrorists from a certain country might inflict terror on US \ncitizens in their own country, in a third country or even in America itself.6 \nAnti-American terrorist incidents emanate from terrorists with nationality from \n91 different countries during the period of our study (1978 to 2005), but as pointed out \nalready, we observe substantial variation in the amount of terrorism across terrorists\u2019 \nhome countries among these 91 countries. Terrorists from 39 different countries killed \n                                     \n6\n  The latter is a rather rare thing to happen, however, despite the 9\/11 attacks. Enders & \nSandler (2006a) find evidence for a regional shift of anti-American terror attacks from the \nWestern hemisphere and Africa to the Middle East and Asia after 9\/11. \n17 \n568 Americans, not counting those killed in the 9\/11 attacks other than the ones inside \nthe airplanes. It is important to note, however, that despite the generally high levels of \npublic concern and despite the fact that Americans are major victims of international \nterrorism, foreign terror on Americans remains a relatively rare event. Terrorist \nincidents involving Americans occur in only about 7.8% of dyad years and Americans \nget killed in only about 1.8% of dyad years. \n4.2. Explanatory Variables \nWe use three different variables to capture the various ways in which the US chooses to \nsupport foreign governments militarily. Our main explanatory variables are thus US \narms exports, military aid, and military personnel stationed abroad. Data on arms \nexports have been provided to us, courtesy of the Stockholm International Peace \nResearch Institute (SIPRI). Data on military aid and military personnel come from \nUSAID (2006) and US Department of Defense (various years), respectively. Military \naid covers both military grants and loans, principally for the acquisition of US defense \nequipment, services, and military training. Active duty military personnel come from all \nservices (army, navy, marine corps and air force). The three variables do not always \nmove in the same direction. Some recipient countries receive a large amount of military \nsupport in one or two dimensions, but not necessarily in the remaining ones. \nIn order to measure the relative dependence of the terrorists\u2019 home country on \nUS military support, we have to relate US arms exports, aid and military personnel to \nsome measure of domestic military strength. For arms exports and aid we divide their \ntotal value by domestic military expenditures. For military personnel, we compute the \n18 \nratio of US to domestic military personnel.7 Data on domestic military spending and \npersonnel come from the Correlate of War\u2019s Composite Index of National Capacity \n(CINC) measure as well as from World Bank (2006).8 \nAs control variables, we include the log of per capita income, the level of de-\nmocracy, the logged population size of the terrorists\u2019 home country and the \ngeographical distance between it and the US. This follows arguments provided by \nKrueger & Laitin (2008) and Abadie (2006) on welfare and terrorism and Enders & \nSandler (2006b) on regime type and terrorism. We control for population size to \naccount for the simple fact that, ceteris paribus, more populous countries may generate \nmore anti-American terrorism. Lastly, we account for the fact that geographical pro-\nximity may lower the costs for terrorists to target Americans. The World Bank (2006) \nprovides data on income and population. The democracy variable is measured by the \nPolity project\u2019s polity2 variable (Marshall, Jaggers & Gurr 2006), which runs from -10 \nto 10. The natural log of the distance between Washington D.C. and the capital city of \nthe terrorists\u2019 home country stems from Bennett & Stam (2005).9  \n                                     \n7\n  One referee suggested using GDP and population as weighting variables instead. We did \nnot follow this advice since we regard our variables as better proxies for a country\u2019s \ncapacity to deal with domestic terrorist threats. In any case, military expenditures and \nmilitary personnel are highly correlated with GDP and population, respectively. \n8\n  We mainly use CINC data and World Bank data only as complement. In the period of \noverlap, the two data sources are so very highly correlated with each other (r = .97) that \npooling them is no problem. \n9\n  For lack of data, we cannot control for the amount and quality (Bueno de Mesquita, 2007) \nof governmental counter-terrorist measures.  \n19 \n4.3. Estimation Method and Models \nOur dependent variables are count variables (number of US citizens killed in terrorist \nattacks and number of terror incidents involving Americans). For all reported results, \nthe negative binomial estimate is more reliable than the Poisson model, because the \nsample variance of the number of killings and incidents exceeds its sample mean by a \nfactor of approximately 35 and 7, respectively. In robustness tests, we also used a \nvariant of the negative binomial called the zero-inflated negative binomial. We compute \nstandard errors adjusted for clustering on the terrorists\u2019 home country, though the varia-\ntions in killings and incidents over time are large and clustering is therefore of minor \nimportance. Our sample covers the period 1978 to 2005 and up to 149 countries.10 Due \nto missing data on the explanatory variables not all possible observations can be \nincluded in the analysis. We do not include year dummies to account for trends in \nforeign terror on Americans, but our results remain fully robust if we do. \n \n5. Empirical Evidence and Analysis \nOur theory predicts that radical terrorist groups are more likely to target US citizens \nwhen United States\u2019 military support stabilizes the government in the home country of \nthe terrorists. In this section we test our hypotheses. Before we present the results of our \nregression analyses, however, we briefly discuss some illustrative evidence. \nEl Salvador provides a good example for illustrating the link between US \nmilitary support on the one hand and anti-American terrorism on the other. With the \n                                     \n10\n  The Iterate data go back to 1968, but the project starts reporting separately on US victims \nonly from 1978 onwards. \n20 \nstart of the civil war in 1980, the US quickly stepped up its military aid to the El \nSalvadoran government from almost nothing to very high levels throughout the 1980s, \nreaching on average about 50% of domestic military expenditures. As a result, there was \na wave of terrorist attacks on Americans throughout the 1980s (40 incidents in total \nbetween 1980 and 1991), whereas there had been practically no terror attacks on \nAmericans before. As the US military aid waned to very low levels in the beginning of \nthe 1990s, anti-American terrorism virtually disappeared, with only two recorded \nincidents since 1992. \nSimilarly, in Guatemala no anti-American terrorism was recorded in the 1970s. \nWhen the US sent large amounts of arms to the Guatemalan government in the early \n1980s, a wave of terror attacks on Americans ensued, lasting for about half a decade. \nLikewise, a period of no anti-American terrorism since 1968 was followed by a range of \nattacks in the early 1980s and then again in the late 1980s when the US sent massive \namounts of military aid and large amounts of arms to the government of Honduras. \nAs pointed out already, US military support for foreign governments can take \nseveral forms, which need not move together. In the case of El Salvador and Guatemala, \nthe US had very few military personnel stationed in the countries. In Honduras, there \nwas at times a larger contingent of US troops stationed, but the number fluctuated over \nthe years. The Philippines provides a better example of how a large contingent of US \nmilitary personnel makes Americans vulnerable to terrorist attacks by domestic \nterrorists. Before the US reduced its personnel stationed in the Philippines from around \n15,000 (equivalent to about 12% of the domestic armed forces) to below 300 from 1993 \nonwards in tandem with reducing its military aid from about 10% relative to domestic \nmilitary expenditures to much lower levels, US citizens suffered a total of 59 terrorist \n21 \nattacks between 1978 and 1992. In contrast, there were only 20 anti-American terrorist \nattacks from 1993 to 2005 despite the continuing and ongoing civil conflict between the \nPhilippine government and rebel groups. \nA more recent example is Saudi Arabia. In the wake of the invasion of Kuwait \nby Iraqi forces and the ensuing Gulf War, the US temporarily stationed a large number \nof troops in the country. These were soon afterwards decreased, but the US continued to \ndeliver large amounts of weapons to the Saudi regime throughout the 1990s. From 1995 \nto 2000, 43 Americans in total were killed by Saudi terrorists, making Saudi Arabia one \nof the top countries of anti-American terrorist origin even before the 9\/11 attacks. There \nwere no recorded attacks by Saudi terrorists on Americans before 1995. \nThis pattern between US military support and anti-American terrorism is not \nconfined to these selected country cases, but can be observed more generally. Whereas \nthe group of top 20 countries in terms of killings of US citizens have a mean ratio of US \nmilitary troops relative to domestic troops of just below 3%, the remaining countries \nhave an average of just 1.2%. The top 20 receive an average of 8.2% of US military aid \nand 5.8% of US arms exports relative to domestic military expenditures, the rest only \n2.5% and 2.2%, respectively. A similar pattern emerges for the group of top 20 \ncountries in terms of terrorist incidents. \nThe illustrative evidence presented above is indicative and consistent with our \nargument, but this brief discussion does not provide a sufficient test of the hypotheses \nderived from our theory. We thus move to a multivariate statistical analysis. \n5.1 Analysis \nWe can look at our empirical estimation problem from two perspectives. On the one \nhand, US arms exports, military aid, and military personnel stationed abroad can have \n22 \nan independent and additive effect on the supported government\u2019s ability to survive the \npolitical challenge by a radical group. On the other hand, however, one could argue that \nwe are interested in an unobservable latent variable, which can be approximated by \nthese three observable variables. A simple cross-correlation may help to decide whether \nour three military support variables can be unified to a sensible \u2018latent\u2019 dimension. \nTable I shows the cross-correlation of US military aid, arms export and military \npersonnel. \n \nTable I: Cross-Correlation of dependence on US military aid, personnel and arms \nexports, 1978-2005 \n military aid arms exports military per-\nsonnel \nmilitary aid dependence 1.00   \narms export dependence .14 1.00  \nmilitary personnel dependence .00 .02 1.00 \n \nTable I reveals that for the United States, military aid, arms exports and military \npersonnel appear to be substitutes rather than complements. The partial correlation \ncoefficients remain low if we exclude relatively wealthy countries (which do not need \nmilitary aid) from the analysis, even though the correlation between military aid and \narms exports increases slightly. \nAccordingly, this simple analysis suggests that our three military support \nvariables cannot usefully be combined into their principal components or a single factor \nscore. In turn, we may use these three variables simultaneously in one regression \nwithout having to fear that the co-variation leads to inefficient and thus unreliable \nestimates (Pl\u00fcmper & Troeger, 2007). This interpretation finds support by a principal \ncomponent analysis, which suggests the existence of two principal components (an \u2018aid \n23 \n\u2013 arms exports\u2019 dimension and a military personnel dimension). Similarly, a maximum \nlikelihood factor analysis shows high values of \u2018uniqueness\u2019, suggesting that the factor \nscore inappropriately describes the original variables.  \nWe therefore conduct only the first type of analysis, where we use the various \nmilitary assistance variables as independent and additive determinants of terrorist \nactivities on Americans. Table II displays the results of models, in which we first \ninclude one \u2018military support\u2019 variable at a time for the number of US citizens killed as \ndependent variable. The exclusion of other military support variables is unlikely to bias \nthe estimates due to the low correlation between these variables. Nevertheless, we also \nshow a model with all military support variables entered simultaneously. \n \nTable II: Negative binomial estimates of number of US citizens killed in terrorist attacks \n \n model k1 model k2  model k3 model k4 \nln population of terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry  \n0.707 \n(0.152) *** \n0.612 \n(0.146) *** \n0.645 \n(0.155) *** \n0.746 \n(0.153) *** \nln distance between terrorists\u2019 \nhome country and US \n0.098 \n(0.135) \n0.028 \n(0.225)  \n-0.034 \n(0.361) \n0.126 \n(0.119)  \nln per capita income of terrorists\u2019 \nhome country \n0.177 \n(0.178) \n0.064 \n(0.164) \n0.112 \n(0.167) \n0.102 \n(0.184)  \nlevel of democracy in terrorists\u2019 \nhome country \n-0.078 \n(0.035) * \n-0.061 \n(0.033) * \n-0.071 \n(0.031) * \n-0.087 \n(0.035) *  \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on US military aid \n0.055 \n(0.019) ** \n  0.049 \n(0.020) * \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on  US arms exports  \n 0.078 \n(0.028) ** \n 0.039 \n(0.021) * \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on US military \npersonnel  \n  0.029 \n(0009) *** \n0.034 \n(0.006) *** \nintercept -16.811 \n(3.961) *** \n-13.810 \n(4.151) ** \n-13.962 \n(5.222) ** \n-17.347 \n(4.073) *** \nln alpha 3.561 \n(0.279) *** \n3.657 \n(0.270) *** \n3.695 \n(0.287) *** \n3.540 \n(0.273) *** \nN obs. 3360 3360 3483 3341 \nWald chi\u00b2 30.32 *** 38.80 *** 25.32 *** 60.97 *** \n-log likelihood 549.05  554.45 563.96 539.39 \n \nStandard errors clustered on terrorists\u2019 home country in parentheses, * p(z)<0.1  ** p(z)<0.01  *** \np(z)<0.001.  \n \n24 \nBefore we come to our variables of main interest and thus to our hypothesis, we briefly \ndiscuss results on the control variables. More populous countries account for more anti-\nAmerican terrorism, all other things equal, as expected. The US seems to be an outlier \nwith respect to the impact of distance on terrorism. In a much larger sample including \nall country dyads for which data was available, we found a highly significantly negative \neffect of distance on terror incidents and victims (Neumayer & Pl\u00fcmper, 2008; Pl\u00fcmper \n& Neumayer, 2008). The global reach and projection of US power apparently \ninvalidates the law of distance that applies to terror attacks against other countries in the \nworld. Interestingly, in line with other studies we also find that per capita income in the \npotential origin countries of terrorists has no statistically significant impact. This should \nat least caution against suggestions that international terrorism will wane with economic \ndevelopment in foreign poor countries \u2013 a position at times held by (among others) \nformer UN General Secretary Kofi Annan, and US Presidents Bill Clinton and George \nW. Bush (see Piazza, 2006). Our results do provide some weak support, however, to \nthose who suggest that a higher level of democracy in foreign countries will lower anti-\nAmerican attacks (see Gause III, 2005). \nTurning to our variables of main interest, we find evidence in favor of our \nhypothesis. In particular, the three \u2018military support\u2019 variables exert a positive impact \non the number of US victims. All three show a significant and positive relation to the \nnumber of American terror victims, as per our theory. The three variables also exert a \nsubstantively important influence on the dependent variable. A one standard deviation \nincrease in the measure of military aid, arms exports and military personnel raises the \nexpected count of anti-American terrorism by 135, 109 and 24%, respectively. \n25 \nModel 4 of Table II shows that the predictions of our theory still find support, \neven if we include the military support simultaneously. An analysis of substantive \neffects based on model 4 allows one to gauge the relative importance of the three \nmeasures of military support when entered together in the estimations. A one standard \ndeviation increase in US military aid raises the expected count of anti-American \nterrorism most by 114%, followed by arms exports and military personnel, of which a \none standard deviation increase leads to an increase of 45 and 30%, respectively. It \nwould thus appear that US military aid matters most for foreign terror on Americans. \nIn Table III we account for the fact that terrorists can attack and, in fact, wound \nAmericans without necessarily managing to kill them. It repeats the models from Table \nII, but this time with terrorist incidents involving American citizens as the dependent \nvariable.  \n26 \nTable III: Negative binomial estimates of number of terrorist incidents with \nAmerican victims \n \n model i1 model i2  model i3 model i4 \nln population of terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry  \n0.668 \n(0.130) *** \n0.617 \n(0.139) *** \n0.645 \n(0.143) *** \n0.677 \n(0.131) *** \nln distance between terrorists\u2019 \nhome country and US \n-0.103 \n(0.442) \n-0.188 \n(0.586)  \n-0.215 \n(0.617) \n-0.058 \n(0.343)  \nln per capita income of \nterrorists\u2019 home country \n0.154 \n(0.103) \n0.066 \n(0.108) \n0.076 \n(0.113) \n0.083 \n(0.111)  \nlevel of democracy in terrorists\u2019 \nhome country \n-0.001 \n(0.023) \n0.010 \n(0.023) \n0.006 \n(0.023) \n0.002 \n(0.024)  \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on US military aid \n0.044 \n(0.013) ** \n  0.038 \n(0.014) ** \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on  US arms exports  \n 0.044 \n(0.016) ** \n 0.024 \n(0.016)  \nterrorists\u2019 home country \ndependence on US military \npersonnel  \n  0.027 \n(0.009) ** \n0.027 \n(0.006) *** \nintercept -12.766 \n(3.672) *** \n-10.522 \n(4.598) * \n-10.743 \n(4.907) * \n-12.899 \n(3.095) *** \nln alpha 2.219 \n(0.131) *** \n2.269 \n(0.128) *** \n2.269 \n(0.134) *** \n2.178 \n(0.136) *** \nN obs. 3360 3360 3483 3341 \nWald chi\u00b2 47.48 *** 40.91 *** 38.63 *** 84.79 *** \n-log likelihood 1765.98  1779.53 1802.06 1749.39 \n \nStandard errors clustered on terrorists\u2019 home country in parentheses, * p(z)<0.1  ** p(z)<0.01  *** \np(z)<0.001 , see Table II for the model notation \n \nAs can be seen, the results are rather similar. Most importantly, our hypothesis still \nfinds support. In the model with all support variables enclosed, the coefficient of the US \narms exports variable becomes marginally insignificant. One potential explanation for \nthis finding is that arms exports are the weakest proxy for military support. If the US \ndoes not provide arms, the odds are that other countries will step in and sell them to a \ngovernment willing to pay. Thus, the entrepreneurs of terror have not as much to win \nfrom attacking the provider of weapons to the government it is in conflict with, \ncompared to foreign providers of other forms of military support. Terror entrepreneurs \nshould respond most clearly to military aid and the presence of foreign troops. The \n27 \nformer often provides military training for the government\u2019s troops, while the latter may \nsupport the home government directly in case of a severe domestic threat.11 In terms of \nsubstantive importance, the estimations on anti-American terror incidents confirm the \nresults from the estimations on terrorist killings of Americans: military aid has the \nstrongest impact followed by military personnel and arms exports, which is, however, \nsubject to the caveat regarding arms exports stated above. \n5.2 Robustness  \nOur results are robust to a number of changes to the research design. To avoid multiple \ncounting, only the first nationality of the terrorists determines the origin country of a \nterrorist act. This has the disadvantage that information on the second and third primary \nnationality of terrorists, also coded in Iterate, is lost, but the vast majority of terrorist \nacts only involve one nationality of terrorists. Our results are robust to attributing \nterrorist acts to all the first three main nationalities of terrorists simultaneously. We \nexclude the few cases for which Iterate does not provide information on the primary \nnationality of terrorists or victims. Also, we do not include terrorist acts committed by \n\u2018Indeterminate Arabs, Palestine\u2019 in the estimations. Our results remain robust if we \nallocate each of these terror attacks to a randomly drawn Arab country. \nAn additional problem occurs because in a small number of cases, Iterate indi-\ncates that Americans were killed, but states the exact number as unknown. The 9\/11 \n                                     \n11\n  Another interesting difference is that democracy is no longer statistically significant for \nincidents, whereas it was significant for killings. This could reflect the fact that Islamist \nterrorists tend to come from autocratic countries and Islamist terrorism on average kills \nmore people per terrorist act than other terrorism, even without 9\/11 (Rapoport, 2004; \nEnders and Sandler, 2006b). \n28 \nterror attacks are the most prominent case: 189 American victims are stated (those on \nthe planes), but for those killed on the ground, Iterate does not state a number, probably \nbecause it remains unknown how many of the 2973 non-terrorists killed in total were \nAmericans (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004: \n552). Less clear is why Iterate attributes the attacks to the group of \u2018Indeterminate \nArabs\u2019, when 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi Arabian. Our results are robust toward \ncounting, as a conservative short cut, two thirds of victims as Americans and allocating \nthe attacks to Saudi Arabia as the origin country. \nAnti-American terrorism is a relatively rare event and some countries never \nproduce any such terrorism. Our dependent variables have thus a large number of zeros \nand some dyads only have zeros. We therefore also estimated the models with all the \nthree military support variables included simultaneously with a zero-inflated negative \nbinomial estimator. This is a maximum likelihood estimator, which assumes that some \nobservations take on a value of zero with probability of one (Long & Freese, 2006). The \nzero-inflated model would thus be appropriate if there were a variable which determined \nwith certainty that no anti-American terror occurred for some cases. This is a \nproblematic assumption since we see no theoretical reason why a particular dyad year \nhas a probability of one of not producing any anti-American terror. Nevertheless, we \nemployed this estimator in robustness tests as it is often (if falsely) used in situations \nwhere the share of zeros is deemed to be \u2018large\u2019. We found that the results from the \nzero-inflated negative binomial estimator were consistent with their negative binomial \nequivalent.12 \n                                     \n12\n  In a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model, a variable can affect the odds of \nalways 0 and\/or affect the expected count for those not always 0, as there are two \n29 \nThe US often renders military support to governments fighting a civil or \ninternational war. If such armed conflict raises general levels of violence, then US \nmilitary support will probably be correlated with an elevated risk of terrorism, whilst \nboth are co-determined by armed conflict. This raises the question whether our results \nspuriously pick up an effect of warfare. Yet, our results, while confirming that warfare \nincreases terrorism, are robust to including both small and large international and civil \narmed conflicts, using data from the Uppsala\/PRIO dataset (Gleditsch et al., 2002). \nAnti-American terrorism does not always remain limited to terror groups that \noppose their domestic government. The US State Department also accuses several for-\neign governments of sponsoring terrorism. If we include a dummy variable, which is set \nto one for years in which another country was accused of as a state sponsor of terrorism \n(data from Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, various years), results \nremain substantively unchanged. The dummy variable itself is never statistically \nsignificantly different from zero suggesting that state sponsorship of terrorism has no \nsignificant effect on the number of Americans killed. This could be either because state \nsponsorship of terrorism remains unimportant, the US allegations point into a false \ndirection or because these governments sponsor anti-American terrorism by nationals \nother than their own. Unfortunately, due to the clandestine nature of such activities, we \n                                                                                                            \nestimating equations (inflation and count equation). For the sum of killings of Americans \nas dependent variable, we found that military aid and military personnel raise the \nexpected count of killings for those that are not always zero. For the sum of anti-\nAmerican terror incidents as dependent variable, these military support variables were \nmarginally insignificant in the count equation, but they significantly lower the odds of \nalways zero in the inflation equation and thus raise the likelihood of terror incidents ever \noccurring. \n30 \ncannot possibly control for state sponsorship of terror by nationals other than the \nsponsoring state. \nFinally, one might also wonder whether our results suffer from reverse causality \nbias. Perhaps, instead of raising the strategic benefits to foreign terrorists and thus \nindirectly leading to anti-American terrorism, US military support goes to countries, \nwhich are the major sources of anti-American terrorism, with the intention to boost their \ncounter-terrorism capacity. If such reverse causality exists, then it should bias the \ncoefficients of our military support variables upwards. We stress that US military \nsupport going to foreign allies, which are faced by a high or increasing domestic \nterrorist threat does not constitute reverse causality, but is fully consistent with our \ntheory. There is potential reverse causality if, and only if, more US military support \ngoes to countries from which high or increasing terror on Americans emanates. The \nstandard textbook approach to endogeneity recommends using instrumental variables \nfor the offending explanatory variables. As almost always, valid and efficient \ninstruments are very difficult to find. We tackled this potential problem with two \ndifferent approaches. First, we used a two-stage instrumental variable negative binomial \napproach, in which we used the relevant US military support variables lagged by ten \nyears. This provides a good instrument for short-term or temporary increases in US \nmilitary support to countries, which have experienced major anti-American terrorism \nbecause practically no anti-American terror campaign included in our dataset lasts \nlonger than a period of ten years. All the military support variables remain statistically \nsignificant in the instrumental variable regressions, albeit at lower z-ratios. Second, we \nused another approach that does not depend on instrumental variables, the validity of \nwhich can always be contested. If reverse causality existed, then it should have become \n31 \nmuch more pronounced after the attacks of 9\/11 when the US stepped up military \nsupport to countries suffering from terrorist threats, particularly threats to US citizens, \nand willing to join the US in its global \u2018war on terror\u2019. As a consequence, the upward \nbias in the estimated coefficients for the military support variables should be much more \npronounced in the period 2002 onwards. In order to conduct this indirect test of reverse \ncausality, we interacted all military support variables with a dummy variable for the \npost-9\/11 years (2002 to 2005). However, these interaction effects were never \nstatistically significant. Additionally, we tested whether it makes any difference to our \nresults if we restrict the sample to the period until 2001, thus excluding the years in \nwhich potential reverse causality, if at all present, is likely to have been strongest. \nAgain, the results remain largely unaffected. Together, we take this as evidence that our \nresults are not spuriously driven by reverse causality bias. \n \n5.3 Extensions  \nOf course, the logic of our strategic theory is not confined to American military support \nfor foreign governments and foreign terror on Americans. It extends to military support \nfrom other countries to foreign governments and therefore to foreign terror on citizens \nfrom these other supporting countries. We restricted our analysis here to the US case \nbecause for the US data on military personnel stationed abroad and military aid given \nare available. Other countries do not report such statistics, nor are reliable data readily \navailable from third parties. We have, however, data on bilateral arms exports from the \nten major arms exporters, taken from SIPRI (2007). If we estimate a model of foreign \nterror on individuals from these major arms exporters (other than the US), then \nconsistent with our theory we find that a larger value of arms exports to domestic \n32 \nmilitary expenditures raises terror from the arms importing country on individuals from \nthe arms exporting country. Moreover, in Pl\u00fcmper & Neumayer (2008) we demonstrate \nfor a global sample that countries that support each other (as proxied by military \nalliances), are more likely to encounter terrorist attacks from foreign terrorists of the \nallied countries and the more so the stronger the foreign ally relative to the terrorists' \nhome country. \n \n6. Conclusion \nThis article has argued that terrorist groups aim at gaining a significant influence on \ntheir home country\u2019s political system or policies and that, therefore, they have an \nincentive to attack targets from foreign countries if the foreign government militarily \nsupports the domestic government of the terrorists\u2019 home country. American military \nsupport to foreign governments creates an incentive for foreign terrorist groups to attack \nAmericans. \nOur study is, to our knowledge, the first one to analyze the link between \nAmerican foreign military policy and foreign terror on Americans quantitatively. Only \nregression analyses in a sample with large spatio-temporal variation can identify \nsystematic patterns, even though this of course does not prove the causal mechanism to \nbe correct. Rather, we have empirically demonstrated that the more governments in \nother countries are dependent on US support in terms of military aid, arms exports and \nstationed military personnel the more attacks against Americans and the more killings \nof Americans by terrorists from these countries can be expected. We therefore found no \nreason for rejecting our theory. \n33 \nData constraints on forms of military support other than arms exports prevent us \nfrom undertaking a similar study for other powers which militarily support foreign \ngovernments. However, the results from our analysis as well as the policy implications \nshould, to mention but two examples, similarly apply to anti-Russian terror in response \nto Russia\u2019s support to Central Asian governments in conflict with domestic terrorists or \nto French support for Algeria and Lebanon (see Shughart, 2006). \nWhat are the policy implications of our analysis? Our results suggest that \nAmericans will, on average, be less at risk of terrorism if the US reduces or even \nwithdraws its military support from countries whose governments are heavily dependent \non US support. They do not support those who argue that \u2018there is no reason to assume \nthat terrorist enemies would let America off the hook if it retreated\u2019 (Betts, 2002: 34), \neven though a reduction in anti-American terrorism may come with a significant time \ndelay after the US retreats. In the short run, terror organizations may even increase the \nnumber and severity of attacks on US targets in order to demonstrate to their peers a \ncausal link between their attacks and US retreat. In the long run, however, we expect \nterrorist activities against American targets to decrease, because the strategic benefit \nfrom attacking Americans declines as America reduces its military support. Note, \nhowever, that if terror groups such as Al Qaeda have wider regional ambitions then \nwithdrawing military support merely from one country in the region without reducing \nsupport to other countries simultaneously is unlikely to reduce the terrorists\u2019 incentive \nto target Americans. \nIt is an entirely different question whether withdrawing military support to \ncountries in which governments face violent opposition from terror groups serves \nAmerica\u2019s best interest. The benefit of reduced risk of terrorism needs to be carefully \n34 \nbalanced against the costs of exposing a weakened government to the terrorists\u2019 \nchallenge. The political, economic, and social gains from supporting political friends \nmay outweigh the costs of foreign terror on Americans.  \n35 \nReferences \nAbadie, Alberto, 2006. \u2018Poverty, political freedom, and the roots of terrorism\u2019, Ameri-\ncan Economic Review 96(2): 50-56. \nAl Qaeda, 2006a. \u2018Declaration of War Against the Americans Occupying the Land of \nthe Two Holy Places\u2019, in David C.
