Introduction\nThis paper examines the problem of drift parameter uncertainty on the optimal hedging of a claim\nin an incomplete market. We study a \u2018basis risk\u2019 model (Davis, 2006; Henderson, 2002; Monoyios,\n2004b; Musiela & Zariphopoulou, 2004) in which a claim on a nontraded asset Y is optimally hedged\nusing a correlated traded asset S, with correlation \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. Our contributions are threefold. First,\nwe improve the analytic approach initiated in Monoyios (2004b) for generating the terminal hedging\nerror distribution, associated with the utility-based hedging of the claim, over simulated asset price\npaths. Second, we use this approach to examine the impact of drift parameter misestimation on the\nterminal hedging error. Third, we propose a filtering approach to the parameter uncertainty problem,\nincorporating Bayesian learning into the drift parameter estimation.\nIn a complete market, such as the Black & Scholes (1973) (BS) setting, perfect hedging of a claim\ndoes not require estimation of the stock price drift \u03bc in the stochastic differential equation (SDE) (1)\nfor the stock S. As is well-known, estimation of the volatility \u03c3 is possible with reasonable confidence\ngiven sufficient data, but as discussed by Rogers (2001) and as we discuss in Section 3, it is virtually\nimpossible to have confidence in an estimate of \u03bc. This has serious implications for optimal investment\nrules such as the classical Merton (1969, 1971) policy, where knowledge of \u03bc is needed to compute the\noptimal proportion of wealth to assign to the risky asset. By the same token, drift parameter uncertainty\nwill also have a bearing on hedging strategies for derivatives in \u2018incomplete\u2019 markets when \u2018hedging\u2019\nbecomes synonymous with \u2018investment\u2019 since there is, in general, no preference-free way to perfectly\nreplicate a claim.\nIn a lognormal basis risk model, it was shown in Monoyios (2004b) that an optimal strategy, based\non exponential utility maximization, gave superior hedging performance than a \u2018naive\u2019 strategy (a BS-\nstyle hedge) that assumes the traded asset S is a good proxy for the nontraded asset Y (tacitly assuming\nthat for high correlation, the approximation \u03c1 \u2248 1 is a good one). This was done by generating the\ndistribution of hedging error associated with hedging the claim over many simulated asset price paths.\n\u2020Email: monoyios@maths.ox.ac.uk\nc\u00a9 The authors 2007.

MONOYIOS\nWith optimal hedging, the hedging error distribution was found to have, among other features, a higher\nmedian relative to that obtained with the BS-style strategy. This reflects the greater frequency of profits\nover losses generated by optimal hedging.\nUnfortunately, however, the optimal strategy requires knowledge of the drift parameters of the dif-\nfusions S and Y , as well as the volatilities and correlation. The drift parameters are notoriously difficult\nto estimate with precision, as already remarked. In contrast, the naive strategy only requires knowledge\nof the volatilities of S and Y . Although estimation of volatility and correlation is itself not perfect, it can\nbe improved with more observations much more rapidly than the drift estimation. For this reason, we\nfocus on the severe problem of drift parameter uncertainty.\nWe investigate the effect of this parameter uncertainty on the hedging error distribution by supposing\nthat the hedger misestimates the drift parameters and we look at the effect on the median hedging\nerror distribution. This reveals that the effect of parameter uncertainty can indeed be severe. It can lead\nto large reductions in median hedging error distribution, depending on the size and direction of the\nmisestimation. The direction of the misestimation can be such as to make the agent too aggressive,\nleading to selling the claim at too low a price and leading to frequent hedging losses. Conversely, if the\nsign of the estimation error is such as to make the agent more conservative, the relative frequency of\nhedging losses is reduced, but at the cost of selling the claim at too high a price, making the agent into\nan uncompetitive market maker.\nWe then initiate a filtering approach to this problem, allowing the agent to use observations of the\nasset prices to update her estimates of the drift parameters. This approach shows promise, though ana-\nlytic results for indifference prices and hedging strategies are not generally available, as the dimension of\nthe problem is increased by incorporating parameter uncertainty. However, we are able to develop an ana-\nlytic approach in the special case when the agent is uncertain about the drift of the nontraded asset only.\nThe effect of such Bayesian learning on the hedging error distribution will be a topic of future papers.\nPartial information problems, in which agents do not have precise knowledge of drift parameters,\nhave received some attention in the context of optimal investment problems such as the classical Merton\n(1969, 1971) problems, but this is the first attempt to examine such uncertainty in the context of opti-\nmal hedging of derivatives. Rogers (2001) investigated the disutility arising from parameter uncertainty\nversus that from discrete portfolio rebalancing for a Merton investor seeking to maximize expected util-\nity of wealth or consumption (the theoretically optimal strategy requires continuous portfolio revision).\nRogers finds that parameter uncertainty outweighs the effect of rebalancing the portfolio infrequently.\nLakner (1995, 1998) uses a dual approach to examine the impact of drift parameter uncertainty on the\nMerton problem, while Brennan (1998) derives the asset price dynamics under the observation filtration\nand characterizes the optimal investment rule in terms of the solution of a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman\n(HJB) equation. Our approach is also based on stochastic control and a HJB equation, though it differs\nfrom Brennan\u2019s in some significant ways. Even though we incorporate uncertainty in the drifts of two\nassets S and Y (Brennan deals with the Merton problem involving a single stock), we are able to treat\nthe problem such that the resulting HJB equation has only one extra dimension compared to the full in-\nformation case. Remarkably, in the case where the investor is uncertain only about the drift of Y , we are\nable to retain the same dimensionality as the full information problem. Future work will exploit these\nfeatures to investigate in detail the effect on the hedging error distribution.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we outline the basis risk model. We recall\nprevious results (Monoyios, 2004b) for the claim\u2019s indifference price and optimal hedging strategy, and\nderive improved analytic formulae (compared to Monoyios, 2004b) for these objects, as well as a SDE\nfor the \u2018residual risk\u2019 (or hedging error) process, allowing for an extremely efficient generation of the\nterminal hedging error distribution via simulation. We demonstrate the superiority of optimal over naive\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 333\nhedging, given perfect knowledge of parameter values. In Section 3, we explore the impact of drift\nparameter uncertainty. We show that one needs hundreds of years of price data to have any confidence\nin drift parameter estimates, and we generate terminal hedging error distributions when the hedger\nmisestimates the drifts of S and Y . Section 4 proposes a filtering algorithm to incorporate Bayesian\nlearning into the drift parameter estimation, and Section 5 concludes.\n2. Basis risk model\nWe consider a basis risk model, involving a traded asset S and a nontraded asset Y , following corre-\nlated log-Brownian motions, as in Davis (2006), Monoyios (2004b), Henderson (2002) and Musiela &\nZariphopoulou (2004). On a complete filtered probability space (\u03a9,F ,F := (Ft )06t6T , P), the stock\nprice process S := (St )06t6T is\ndSt = \u03bcSt dt + \u03c3 St dBt (1)\nand the nontraded asset price process Y := (Yt )06t6T is\ndYt = \u03bdYt dt + \u03b2Yt dWt , (2)\nwhere \u03bc, \u03c3, \u03bd and \u03b2 are constants and the Brownian motions B and W have correlation \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]:\ndBt dWt = \u03c1 dt, W = \u03c1B +\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03c12Z ,\nwhere B and Z are independent Brownian motions.\nAn agent may trade the stock in a self-financing fashion, leading to the portfolio wealth process\nX\u03c0 \u2261 X := (Xt )06t6T satisfying\ndXt = r Xt dt + \u03c3\u03c0t (\u03bb dt + dBt ), \u03bb := (\u03bc\u2212 r)\/\u03c3,\nwhere r > 0 is a constant rate of interest and \u03c0 := (\u03c0t )06t6T is the wealth in the stock, representing the\nagent\u2019s trading strategy. An admissible trading strategy is one satisfying\n\u222b T\n0 \u03c0\n2\nt dt < \u221e almost surely.\nDenote the set of such strategies by A.\nA European claim on Y pays h(YT ) at time T . The claim cannot be perfectly replicated using a\nportfolio in S unless |\u03c1| = 1, so the market is incomplete. Suppose the agent takes a position in n\nclaims at some time t 6 T . The utility-indifference approach to valuing such a position in the claim has\nbeen analysed by Davis (2006), Henderson (2002) and Musiela & Zariphopoulou (2004) among others.\nThis strand of research culminated with Monoyios (2004b), who analysed the optimal hedging of the\nclaim associated with the utility-indifference approach. This showed that optimal hedging produces a\nhedge profit and loss distribution that had a higher median hedging error than a naive strategy based on\nthe \u03c1 \u2192 1 limit of the optimal hedging formulae, and which therefore tacitly assumes that the traded\nasset is a good proxy for the nontraded asset. In this sense, optimal hedging was shown to be beneficial,\neven when the correlation is close to 1.\nThe major caveat to the above arguments is that the optimal strategies require knowledge of the\ndrift parameters \u03bc and \u03bd of the assets, as well as the volatilities and correlation. In contrast, the naive\nstrategies require only knowledge of the volatilities. This casts doubt on the true efficacy of the optimal\nschemes in the face of the severe parameter uncertainty associated with drift estimation.\nWe introduce the well-known minimal martingale measure QM of Fo\u00a8llmer & Schweizer (1991)\nwhich will feature in many of our formulae. The probability measure QM has density process with\n334 M. MONOYIOS\nrespect to P given by\ndQM\ndP\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Ft = E(\u2212\u03bb \u2219 B)t , 0 6 t 6 T .\nUnder QM, (S, Y ) follow\ndSt = r St dt + \u03c3 St dBQMt ,\ndYt = (\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bb)Yt dt + \u03b2Yt dWQMt ,\nwhere BQM and WQM are correlated Brownian motions under QM. The discounted stock price S is a\nlocal QM-martingale (the drift of S is r ), but this is not the case for the nontraded asset unless we have\nthe perfect correlation case \u03c1 = 1. In this case, Y is effectively a traded asset (as Yt is then a function of\nSt ), so the QM-drift of Y is r . Therefore, given \u03c3 and \u03b2, in the \u03c1 = 1 case the drifts are related by\n\u03b8 := \u03bd \u2212 r\n\u03b2\n= \u03bc\u2212 r\n\u03c3\n=: \u03bb.\nIn this case, the market becomes complete, and perfect hedging is possible. It is easy to show that with\n\u03c1 = 1 so that W = B, we have\nYt = Y0\n(\nSt\nS0\n)\u03b2\/\u03c3\nect\nc=\n(\nr + 1\n2\n\u03c3\u03b2\n)(\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n\u03c3\n)\n.\nLet the claim price process be v(t, Yt ), 0 6 t 6 T , where v: [0, T ] \u00d7 R+ \u2192 R+ is smooth enough to\napply the Ito\u02c6 formula so that\ndv(t, Yt ) = [vt (t, Yt )+AY v(t, Yt )]dt + \u03b2Ytvy(t, Yt )dWt ,\nwhere AY is the generator of the process Y in (2). The replication conditions are\nXt = v(t, Yt ), 0 6 t 6 T, dXt = dv(t, Yt ).\nStandard arguments then show that to perfectly hedge the claim, one must hold \u0394t shares of S at t \u2208\n[0, T ], given by\n\u0394t = \u03b2\n\u03c3\nYt\nSt\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n(t, Yt ), (3)\nand the claim pricing function v(t, y) satisfies\nvt (t, y)+ (\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb)yvy(t, y)+ 12\u03b22y2vyy(t, y)\u2212 rv(t, y) = 0,\nv(T, y) = h(y).\nBut with \u03c1 = 1, \u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb = r , so we get the BS partial differential equation (PDE), and\nv(t, Yt ) = BS(t, Yt ),\nwhere BS(t, y) denotes the BS option pricing formula at time t with underlying asset price y.\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 335\n2.1 Utility-indifference valuation and hedging\nNow, suppose the correlation is not perfect so that the market is incomplete. We embed the problem in a\nutility-maximization framework in a manner that is by now classical. Let the agent have risk preferences\nexpressed via the exponential utility function\nU (x) = \u2212exp(\u2212\u03b1x), x \u2208 R, \u03b1 > 0.\nThe agent maximizes the expected utility of terminal wealth at time T with a random endowment of n\nunits of claim pay-off:\nJ (t, x, y;\u03c0) = E[U (XT + nh(YT ))|Xt = x, Yt = y].\nThe value function is u(n)(t, x, y) \u2261 u(t, x, y), defined by\nu(t, x, y) := sup\n\u03c0\u2208A\nJ (t, x, y;\u03c0), (4)\nu(T, x, y) = U (x + nh(y)). (5)\nDenote the optimal trading strategy that achieves the supremum in (4) by \u03c0\u2217 \u2261 \u03c0\u2217,n , and denote the\noptimal wealth process by X\u2217 \u2261 X\u2217,n .\nWe make the following assumption to ensure that we get a meaningful optimization problem in (4).\nASSUMPTION 1 The random endowment nh(YT ) is bounded below.\nThis assumption ensures that the maximum utility in (4) is well-defined, and means that we can\ncover the cases of short and long put positions and long call positions. The case of valuing a short call\nposition in this framework is a topic for future research.\nThe following definitions of utility-based price and hedging strategy are now standard (seeMonoyios,\n2004a,b; Musiela & Zariphopoulou, 2004, for instance).\nDEFINITION 1 (Indifference price) The indifference price per claim at t \u2208 [0, T ], given Xt = x, Yt = y\nand p(t, x, y) \u2261 p(n)(t, x, y), is defined by\nu(n)(t, x \u2212 np(n)(t, x, y), y) = u(0)(t, x, y).\nWe allow for possible dependence on t, x and y of p(n) in the above definition, but with exponential\npreferences it turns out that there is no dependence on x .\nDEFINITION 2 (Optimal hedging strategy) The optimal hedging strategy for n units of the claim is\n\u03c0(H) := (\u03c0(H)t )06t6T given by\n\u03c0\n(H)\nt := \u03c0\u2217,nt \u2212 \u03c0\u2217,0t , 0 6 t 6 T .\nThe solution to the optimization problem (4) is well-known, using the so-called distortion technique\n(Zariphopoulou, 2001).

The indifference pricing function p(t, y) \u2261 p(n)(t, y) then satisfies\npt + (\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bb)ypy + 12\u03b2\n2y2 pyy \u2212 rp \u2212 12\u03b2\n2y2nb(t, T )\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03c12)(py)2 = 0.\nGiven the above results, it is easy to show that the expression (6) for the optimal control loses its\ndependence on x and simplifies to\n\u03a0\u2217(t, y) := 1\n\u03b1\u03c3b(t, T )\n(\n\u03bb+ \u03c1\u03b2y\n1\u2212 \u03c12\nFy\nF\n)\n.\nThen, applying Definition 2 gives the optimal hedging strategy for a position in n claims (see Monoyios,\n2004b, for further details of this derivation).\nPROPOSITION 2 The optimal hedging strategy for a position in n claims is to hold \u0394(H)t shares at\nt \u2208 [0, T ] given by\n\u0394\n(H)\nt = \u2212n\u03c1\n\u03b2\n\u03c3\nYt\nSt\n\u2202p(n)\n\u2202y\n(t, Yt ).\nWe note that if n = 1 and \u03c1 = 1, we recover the perfect delta hedge (3), and that the claim price\nthen satisfies the BS PDE.\n2.2 The residual risk process\nSuppose the agent trades n claims at time 0 for price p(n)(0, Y0) per claim. The agent hedges this position\nover [0, T ] using the strategy (\u0394(H)t )06t6T . Her overall position has value process V := (Vt )06t6T\ngiven by Vt = X (H)t + np(n)(t, Yt ) so that\ndVt = dX (H)t + n dp(n)(t, Yt ), (8)\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 337\nwhere X (H) = (X (H)t )06t6T is the value of the hedging portfolio in S, satisfying\ndX (H)t =\u0394(H)t dSt + r(X (H)t \u2212\u0394(H)t St )dt,\nX (H)0 =\u2212np(n)(0, Y0).\nUsing this in (8) along with the Ito\u02c6 formula and the PDE satisfied by p(n)(t, y), we obtain\ndVt = rVt dt + 12\u03b2\n2n2b(t, T )\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03c12)Y 2t (p(n)y )2(t, Yt )dt + \u03b2n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03c12Yt p(n)y (t, Yt )dZt , (9)\nwith V0 = 0. We call V the residual risk (or hedging error) process. The term in dZt , orthogonal to\nthe Brownian increments driving the stock price, is interpreted as the unhedgeable component of risk.\nIf \u03c1 = 1, we see that the process V becomes riskless, reflecting the fact that the market incompleteness\ndisappears in this case.\n2.3 Cumulant expansions\nWe are interested in analysing the distribution of the terminal hedging error VT . This is not possible in\nclosed form, so our approach is to use the SDE (9) to simulate V over many asset price histories and\ncompute the distribution of terminal hedging error VT . This is a similar approach to that in Monoyios\n(2004b), but the use of the SDE (9) makes the procedure more efficient than in Monoyios (2004b).\nTo simulate V via (9) efficiently, we use analytic approximations for p(t, y) and py(t, y), in the\nform of power series expansions in powers of a := \u2212\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03c12)n. These arise from a Taylor expansion\nof the indifference pricing function\np(n)(t, y) = 1\nb(t, T )a\nlog EQ\nM[exp(ah(YT ))| Yt = y]. (10)\nFor a random variable X , recall that its cumulant generating function (CGF) (Grimmett & Stirzaker,\n2001; Spanos, 1999) is \u03a8X (a) := log E exp(aX). Using linearity of the expectation operator, it is not\nhard to see that the CGF has a Taylor expansion of the form\n\u03a8X (a) =\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n1\nj!k j (X)a\nj ,\nwhere k j (X) \u2261 k j is the \u2018 j th cumulant\u2019 of X related to the j th central moment of X as described below.\nWriting\nm j (X) := E(X j ), \u03bc j (X) := E[(X \u2212 m1) j ], j \u2208 N,\nfor the j th raw and central moments, it is not hard to show that\nk1(X)=m1(X),\nk2(X)=\u03bc2(X),\nk3(X)=\u03bc3(X),\nk4(X)=\u03bc4(X)\u2212 3\u03bc22(X),\nk5(X)=\u03bc5(X)\u2212 10\u03bc2(X)\u03bc3(X),\n338 M. MONOYIOS\nwhich can also be expressed in terms of the raw moments only: for j \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5},\nk2 =m2 \u2212 m21,\nk3 =m3 \u2212 3m1m2 + 2m31,\nk4 =m4 \u2212 4m1m3 \u2212 3m22 + 12m21m2 \u2212 6m41,\nk5 =m5 \u2212 5m1m4 \u2212 10m2m3 + 20m21m3 + 30m1m22 \u2212 60m31m2 + 24m51, (11)\nwhere the dependence on X is suppressed for brevity.\nSince the pricing function (10) is proportional to the CGF of the pay-off under the minimal measure,\nwe have the following analytic approximation for the indifference pricing function.\nPROPOSITION 3 The indifference pricing function p(n)(t, y) has the power series expansion\np(n)(t, y) = 1\nb(t, T )\n5\u2211\nj=1\n1\nj!k j (h(YT ))a\nj\u22121 + O(a5), (12)\nwhere a = \u2212\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03c12)n and k j is the j th cumulant of the pay-off under QM, conditional on Yt = y.\nThe expansion is valid for model parameters satisfying\nEQ\nM[exp(ah(YT ))|Yt = y] 6 2. (13)\nProof. Expand the exponential inside the expectation in (10) as a Taylor series and use linearity of the\nexpectation operator to give\np(n)(t, y) = 1\nab(t, T )\nlog\n\uf8eb\uf8ed1+ \u221e\u2211\nj=1\na j\nj!m j (h(YT ))\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 ,\nwhere m j (h(YT )) \u2261 EQM[h j (YT )|Yt = y]. Then, (12) follows from applying the Taylor expansion of\nlog(1+ x). This is valid for |x | 6 1. In our case, this means we require\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\na j\nj!m j (h(YT )) 6 1,\nwhich is implied by (13), and the proof is complete. \u00a4\nUsing these equations, we are able to produce an accurate perturbation series for p(n)(t, y), as a\nseries of BS-type formulae, which can be differentiated term by term to give an analytic approximation\nfor py(t, y). The leading-order term in the price expansion is Davis\u2019 (1997) marginal price. The terms\nin the expansion depend ultimately on the moments m j := EQM[h j (YT )|Yt = y], j \u2208 N, and (in the\ncase of py(t, y)) on their partial derivatives \u2202m j := \u2202m j\/\u2202y, j \u2208 N. The formulae up to order a4 are\ngiven below in the case of a put option on the nontraded asset. The formulae are extensions of those in\nMonoyios (2004b): first, the power series expansions for p(n)(t, y) and p(n)y (t, y) are extended to higher\norder in a than in Monoyios (2004b); second, we develop a single succinct formula for the j th moment\nm j := EQM[h j (YT )|Yt = y], j \u2208 N, and also for its derivative \u2202m j := \u2202m j\/\u2202y, j \u2208 N. These follow\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 339\nfrom the fact that under QM, conditional upon Yt = y, log YT is normally distributed. With N (M,\u03a32)\ndenoting the normal probability law with mean M and variance \u03a32, we have\nlog YT \u223cN\n(\nlog y + b \u2212 1\n2\nv2, v2\n)\n,\nb= (r \u2212 q)(T \u2212 t),\nq = r \u2212 (\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bb),\nv2 = \u03b22(T \u2212 t). (14)\nFor the optimal hedging strategy, the explicit results are obtained by differentiating (12) with respect\nto y, giving the following corollary. Denote by \u2202\u03ba j the partial derivative of \u03ba j with respect to y:\n\u2202\u03ba j \u2261 \u2202\u03ba j\n\u2202y\n,\nwhere \u03ba j denotes any of m j , \u03bc j and k j .\nCOROLLARY 1 The partial derivative of the indifference price p(n)(t, y)with respect to y has the power\nseries expansion\n\u2202p(n)\n\u2202y\n(t, y) = 1\nb(t, T )\n5\u2211\nj=1\n1\nj!

MONOYIOS\nThe significance of the expansions is that they give easily computed closed-form approximations\nfor the indifference price and optimal hedge. In the specific case of a put option, we have the following\nformulae for the raw moments of the pay-off under the minimal measure QM.\nPROPOSITION 4 For a put option, h(y) = (K \u2212 y)+, where K > 0 is the strike price, the j th moment\nm j := EQM[h j (YT )|Yt = y], j \u2208 N, is given by\nm j =\nj\u2211\n`=0\n( j\n`\n)\n(\u2212y)`K ( j\u2212`) exp\n[\n`\n(\nb + 1\n2\n(`\u2212 1)v2\n)]\nN (\u2212d1 \u2212 (`\u2212 1)v),\nwhere N (\u2219) denotes the standard cumulative normal distribution function, and where\nd1 = 1\nv\n[\nlog\n( y\nK\n)\n+ b + 1\n2\nv2\n]\n,\nb= (r \u2212 q)(T \u2212 t),\nq = r \u2212 (\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bb),\nv2 = \u03b22(T \u2212 t).\nProof.

This is a straightforward (but lengthy) exercise in differentiation. \u00a4\nWe now have a fast (instantaneous) and accurate (see Monoyios, 2004b) computation of the optimal\nprice and hedging strategy. Note that the leading-order term in the expansion for the price is the marginal\nprice, p\u0302(t, y) = EQM[h(YT )|Yt = y], of the claim.\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 341\n2.4 Optimal versus naive hedging\nWe wish to compare the hedging of the claim with the optimal strategy with the naive strategy (3) which\ntakes S as a good proxy for Y . To this end, repeat the calculation leading to the residual risk SDE (9),\nbut with the claim traded at the BS price BS(0, Y0) per claim and hedged using the \u03c1 \u2192 1 limit of\nhedging formula (even though the true value of \u03c1 is not equal to 1). This results in the naive hedging\nerror process V N following\ndV Nt = rV Nt dt + n\u03b2Yt (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03bb)vy(t, Yt )dt + n\u03b2Ytvy(t, Yt )[(\u03c1 \u2212 1)dBt +\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03c12 dZt ].\nOnce again, we note that this is not riskless, but becomes so if the true value of \u03c1 is indeed 1. The naive\ntrader hopes this proves a good approximation.\nSuppose the agent sells a put option (so n = \u22121) on the nontraded asset. Figure 1 shows the optimal\nand naive hedging error distributions generated from 10,000 asset price histories for \u03c1 = 0.75. \u03b1 = 0.01\nwith the other parameters as in Table 1.

Parameter uncertainty\nThe results above indicate that optimal hedging is beneficial, with the proviso that we know the parame-\nters \u03bc, \u03c3, \u03bd, \u03b2 and \u03c1 with certainty. This is a strong assumption, of course. The effect of drift parameter\nuncertainty is particularly severe. As Rogers (2001) mentions, one can achieve reasonable confidence\nin estimates of volatilities and correlation with a few years of data, but one needs hundreds of years of\ndata to have any confidence in estimates of drift parameters.\nIt is worth spelling out some precise details on this that do not appear in Rogers (2001). For simplic-\nity, let us take r = 0 and a stock price S following\ndSt = \u03c3 St (\u03bb dt + dBt ),\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bc\/\u03c3 , and consider an agent trying to infer the value of \u03bb from observations of the share price.\nAssume (unrealistically, of course) for simplicity that the agent observes the stock returns continuously\nand that the volatility \u03c3 is known. The agent records the normalized returns\ndSt\n\u03c3 St\n= \u03bb dt + dBt ,\nand uses these to estimate \u03bb. Using observations over a time interval [0, t], the best estimate of \u03bb is \u03bb\u02c9(t)\ngiven by\n\u03bb\u02c9(t) = 1\nt\n\u222b t\n0\ndSs\n\u03c3 Ss\n= \u03bb+ Bt\nt\n. (15)\nThe estimator is normally distributed, \u03bb\u02c9(t) \u223c N (\u03bb, 1\/t), so (\u03bb\u02c9(t) \u2212 \u03bb)\/(1\/\u221at) is a standard normal\nrandom variable. Hence, a 95% confidence interval for \u03bb is[\n\u03bb\u02c9(t)\u2212 1.96\u221a\nt\n, \u03bb\u02c9(t)+ 1.96\u221a\nt\n]\n.\nSuppose that the true parameter values are \u03bc = 20% per annum and \u03c3 = 20% per annum so that \u03bb = 1.\nWe ask, for how long do we have to observe the share price to be 95% certain that we know the value\nof \u03bb to within 5% of its true value? That is, we require |\u03bb\u02c9(t)\u2212 \u03bb| 6 0.05. This implies that\n\u03bb\u02c9(t)+ 1.96\u221a\nt\n\u2212\n(\n\u03bb\u02c9(t)\u2212 1.96\u221a\nt\n)\n= 0.1,\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 343\nwhich gives t \u2248 1537 years. This gives a measure of the severity of drift parameter uncertainty in\nlognormal models, and it is remarkable that (to the best of our knowledge) the above calculation does\nnot appear in any of the standard financial mathematics texts.\nIn the rest of this paper, we shall restrict our attention to uncertainty in the drifts of the asset prices in\nthe basis risk model, assuming that the agent has precise knowledge of the volatilities and the correlation.\n3.1 Optimal hedging with erroneous drift parameters\nIn this section, we assess the impact of drift parameter misestimation by repeating the simulation experi-\nments of Section 2.4 using erroneous values for the drift parameters \u03bc and \u03bd. That is, we assume that\nthe agent computes the indifference price and optimal hedging strategy using her (incorrect) estimates\nof the parameters, but the simulated asset price histories are generated using the correct values of the\nparameters.\nFigure 2 shows the optimal and naive hedging error distributions from hedging a short put position\nin the case when the agent\u2019s estimates of these parameters are 50% higher than the true values.\nSummary statistics for the hedge error distributions, in Table 4, show that the optimal hedge is still\nsuperior to the naive hedge, though not to the extent seen earlier. (For comparison, Table 5 shows the\nhedging error statistics if the correct drift parameter values are used.) This can be traced to the fact that\nif the agent overestimates \u03bd, she lowers the asking price for the put (relative to the asking price with\nthe true model parameters), so the claim is viewed as less risky than it truly is.

As we shall see, this is not always the case.\nTable 6 shows the results if the drifts are both underestimated by 50%. In this case, the optimal\nhedging appears to be even more beneficial than before because the agent perceives the claim to be\nriskier than it truly is, and raises the asking price of the put (relative to the asking price with the true\nmodel parameters).\nTable 7 shows the results when the stock price drift \u03bc is overestimated by 50% and the nontraded\nasset price drift \u03bd is underestimated by 50%. The effect of parameter misestimation now becomes more\nsignificant. The agent believes that the claim is riskier than it truly is, and this effect is exacerbated\nby hedging with a traded asset which the agent believes is a less-effective hedging instrument than it\nreally is. The result is that the agent significantly raises the price at which she sells the option (by about\n50% over the price she would charge if she knew the true drift values), and this results in an optimal\nhedging error distribution that is much more favourable than the naive hedging distribution. Of course,\nthis improvement has come at a cost of selling the claim at a very high price, so the agent becomes a\nvery uncompetitive market maker who may not be able to sell the put at her chosen price.\nFinally, Table 8 shows the results in the case that the stock price drift \u03bc is underestimated by 50%\nand the nontraded asset price drift \u03bd is overestimated by 50%. Now, the effect of parameter misesti-\nmation becomes truly destructive. The agent believes that the claim is \u2018less\u2019 risky than it truly is, so\nbecomes overly aggressive, selling the claim for a low price, and this results in an optimal hedging\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 345\nTABLE 6 Summary statistics for hedging a short put when the drifts \u03bc and \u03bd are\nunderestimated by 50% with \u03c1 = 0.75 and \u03b1 = 0.01.

This would lead to\ndisastrous losses in practice.\nOverall, we conclude that drift parameter misestimation is occasionally benign, but can be extremely\ndestructive, depending on the sign of the misestimation. In Section 4, we propose a Bayesian learning\nalgorithm that may help remedy this situation.\n4. A filtering approach\nIn this section, we acknowledge uncertainty in drift parameters by taking them to be random variables\nwith known prior distribution, and we shall require the agent\u2019s trading strategies to be adapted to the\n346 M. MONOYIOS\nobservation filtration generated by the asset prices S and Y . We shall refer to this problem as one of \u2018par-\ntial information\u2019. A number of authors (Lakner, 1995, 1998; Brennan, 1998) have treated the classical\nMerton (1969, 1971) optimal investment problems under partial information. Our approach is similar\nthough our problem is more complex. We show how it is possible to treat the problem as a Markovian\none with only one extra dimension compared to the full information problem.\nFurthermore, we are able to treat a special case, where the agent only has uncertainty in \u03b8 , in an\nanalytic fashion. The implementation of the filtering solution to simulated and real data is left as a topic\nfor future work. Here, in a preliminary foray into the filtering approach, we are concerned with showing\nthe ideas behind the technique.\nFor simplicity, we take r = 0. The asset price SDEs are then\ndSt = \u03c3 St (\u03bb dt + dBt ),\ndYt = \u03b2Yt (\u03b8 dt + dWt ), (16)\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bc\/\u03c3 and \u03b8 = \u03bd\/\u03b2. We shall suppose that the distributions of \u03bb and \u03b8 are normal, with\n\u03bb \u223c N (\u03bb0, v0), \u03b8 \u223c N (\u03b80, \u03b30).\nWe suppose that the agent infers the values of \u03bb0 and v0 (respectively, \u03b80 and \u03b30) by observing the values\nof S (respectively, Y ) over some time interval [\u2212\u03c4, 0], and using classical estimation theory, as described\nby (15). The agent will then filter (update) her estimates of \u03bb and \u03b8 from subsequent observations of\n\u03bet := 1\n\u03c3\n\u222b t\n0\ndSs\nSs\n= \u03bbt + Bt ,\n\u03b6t := 1\n\u03b2\n\u222b t\n0\ndYs\nYs\n= \u03b8 t +Wt , (17)\nover the hedging interval [0, T ]. We can treat this as a standard Kalman filtering problem with the\nfollowing solution.\nTHEOREM 1 Let H := (Ht )06t6T denote the observation filtration, with Ht = F \u03bet \u222a F \u03b6t , where\n(F \u03bet )06t6T denotes the natural filtration of \u03be (and similarly for \u03b6 ).\nThe problem with partial information can be reduced to one with full information, with the parame-\nters \u03bb and \u03b8 replaced by random parameters \u03bb\u02c6t \u2261 \u03bb\u02c6(t, St ) and \u03b8\u02c6t \u2261 \u03b8\u02c6 (t, Yt ) given by\n\u03bb\u02c6(t, St )= \u03bb0 + v0\u03bet1+ v0t ,\n\u03b8\u02c6 (t, Yt )= \u03b80 + \u03b30\u03b6t1+ \u03b30t , (18)\nwhere\n\u03bet = 1\n\u03c3\nlog\n(\nSt\nS0\n)\n+ 1\n2\n\u03c3 t,\n\u03b6t = 1\n\u03b2\nlog\n(\nYt\nY0\n)\n+ 1\n2\n\u03b2t. (19)\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 347\nThe asset price dynamics are then\ndSt = \u03c3 St (\u03bb\u02c6(t, St )dt + dB\u0302t ), (20)\ndYt = \u03b2Yt (\u03b8\u02c6(t, Yt )dt + dW\u0302t ), (21)\nwhere W\u0302 and B\u0302 are correlated Brownian motions in the observation filtration.\nProof. We give the analysis for the filtering of the stock price drift. The analysis is identical for the case\nof the nontraded asset.\nUsing the nomenclature of \u00d8ksendal (2003) for filtering theory, the \u2018observation process\u2019 is \u03be =\n(\u03bet )06t6T , described by\nd\u03bet = \u03bb dt + dBt .\nThe unobservable \u2018signal process\u2019 is \u03bb, described by\nd\u03bb = 0.\nDefine the optimally filtered value of \u03bb, the process \u03bb\u02c6 = (\u03bb\u02c6t )06t6T by the conditional expectation\n\u03bb\u02c6t := E[\u03bb|F \u03bet ], \u03bb\u02c60 = \u03bb0,\nand denote the conditional variance of \u03bb by the process v = (vt )06t6T , given by\nvt := E[(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u02c6t )2|F \u03bet ],\nwith initial value v0.\nThe \u2018innovations process\u2019 is B\u0302 = (B\u0302t )06t6T , defined by\nB\u0302t := \u03bet \u2212\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03bb\u02c6s ds. (22)\nBy classical filtering results (e.g. Lemma 6.2.6 in \u00d8ksendal, 2003), B\u0302 is an F \u03bet -Brownian motion. Fur-\nther, by the celebrated Kalman\u2013Bucy filter (e.g. Theorem 6.2.8 in \u00d8ksendal, 2003), the optimal filter \u03bb\u02c6t\nsatisfies the SDE\nd\u03bb\u02c6t = \u2212vt \u03bb\u02c6t dt + vt d\u03bet . (23)\nMoreover, vt solves the Riccati equation\ndvt\ndt\n= \u2212v2t ,\nwhich has solution\nvt = v01+ v0t .\nInserting this into (23) and solving the SDE for \u03bb\u02c6t give (18). Moreover, \u03bet = \u03bbt + Bt (from (17)), while\nthe stock price SDE (16) has solution\nSt = S0 exp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n\u03c3 2t + \u03c3(\u03bbt + Bt )\n)\n= S0 exp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n\u03c3 2t + \u03c3\u03bet\n)\n,\nfrom which (19) follows.\n348 M. MONOYIOS\nFinally, using the definition (22) of the innovations process, we can write the SDE for the stock in\nterms of processes adapted to the observation filtration as follows:\ndSt = \u03c3 St d\u03bet = \u03c3 St (\u03bb\u02c6t dt + dB\u0302t ),\nwhich is (20). \u00a4\nUsing Theorem 1, we can now use standard techniques to solve the agent\u2019s optimal hedging problem\nwith asset price dynamics given by (20) and (21). The agent\u2019s value function is now\nu(t, s, x, y) := sup\n\u03c0\u2208A\nJ (t, s, x, y;\u03c0),\nJ (t, x, y;\u03c0) := E[U (XT + nh(YT ))|St = s, Xt = x, Yt = y],\nu(T, s, x, y) = U (x + nh(y)),\nwhere X is the wealth process described by dXt = (\u03c0t\/St )dSt .\nDefine the differential operator A(QM)S,Y as the generator of the 2D process S, Y in (20) and (21)\nunder the minimal martingale measure:\nA(QM)S,Y f = 1\n2\n\u03c3 2s2 fss + \u03b2y(\u03b8\u02c6 \u2212 \u03c1\u03bb\u02c6) fy + 12\u03b2\n2y2 fyy + \u03c1\u03c3\u03b2sy fsy,\nfor any function f (t, s, y). We then have the following result.\nPROPOSITION 6 The value function u(t, s, x, y) is given by\nu(t, s, x, y) = \u2212e\u2212\u03b1x f (t, s, y), (24)\nwhere the function f satisfies\nft +A(QM)S,Y \u2212 12 \u03bb\u02c6\n2 f \u2212 (\u03c1\u03b2y fy + \u03c3 s fs)\n2\n2 f = 0, (25)\nwith f (T, s, y) = e\u2212\u03b1nh(y). The optimal trading strategy is \u03c0 = (\u03c0\u2217t )06t6T given by \u03c0\u2217t = \u03a0\u2217(t, St , Yt ),\nwhere\n\u03a0\u2217(t, s, y) = \u03bb\u02c6\n\u03c3\u03b1\n+ \u03c1\u03b2y fy + \u03c3 s fs\n\u03c3\u03b1 f . (26)\nProof. The HJB equation for u(t, s, x, y) is\nut +ASu +AY u + \u03c1\u03c3\u03b2syusy \u2212 (\u03bb\u02c6ux + \u03c1\u03b2yuxy + \u03c3 susx )\n2\n2uxx\n= 0,\nwhereAS andAY are the generators of the diffusions (20) and (21). The optimal trading strategy is \u03c0\u2217 =\n(\u03c0\u2217t )06t6T given by \u03c0\u2217t = \u03a0\u2217(t, St , X\u2217t , Yt ), where the optimal feedback control function\u03a0\u2217(t, s, x, y)\nis given by\n\u03a0\u2217(t, s, x, y) := \u2212\n(\n\u03bb\u02c6ux + \u03c1\u03b2yuxy + \u03c3 susx\n\u03c3uxx\n)\n(27)\nand X\u2217t is the optimal wealth process satisfying dX\u2217t = (\u03c0\u2217t \/St )dSt . Now, separate out the dependence\non initial wealth x as in (24). Then, the function f satisfies (25), and the expression (27) for the optimal\ncontrol then simplifies to (26). \u00a4\nOPTIMAL HEDGING AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY 349\nREMARK 1 In the above proof, we have implicitly supposed that a classical solution to the PDE (25)\nexists, to which the Ito\u02c6 formula can be applied. If this is the case, then optimality of the proposed\nsolution for the value function follows from a verification theorem. In the absence of a classical solution\nto (25), techniques based on generalized solutions such as viscosity solutions would have to be used to\ndemonstrate that the candidate solution is indeed optimal. This will be investigated in future research\nwhen a full solution to the optimal hedging problem under partial information will be sought.\nWe recognize the first term in (26) as the classical Merton strategy. The subsequent terms represent\nthe additional hedging associated with (i) the randomness in Y (the risk from the claim), which includes\nuncertainty in the drift of Y , and (ii) the risk associated with uncertainty in the drift of S.\n4.1 A special case with an analytic solution\nWe now consider the special case that the agent has precise knowledge of the stock price drift, but we\nretain uncertainty in the drift of the nontraded asset. Then, the dependence of the value function and\noptimal trading strategy on S disappears. The problem becomes similar to the full information problem\nand the distortion (Zariphopoulou, 2001) technique can be used to give the following solution for the\nvalue function and optimal trading strategy.\nPROPOSITION 7 In the case where the agent has precise knowledge of the stock price drift, with uncer-\ntainty in the drift of the nontraded asset, the value function and indifference price are given by\nu(t, x, y)=\u2212e\u2212\u03b1x\u2212 12\u03bb2(T\u2212t)[H(t, y)]1\/(1\u2212\u03c12),\nH(t, y)= EQM[exp(\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03c12)nh(YT ))|Yt = y],\np(t, y)=\u2212 1\n\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03c12)n log H(t, y),\nwhere QM denotes the minimal martingale measure for the market (20) and (21), under which Y follows\ndYt = \u03b2(\u03b8\u02c6(t, Yt )\u2212 \u03c1\u03bb)Yt dt + \u03b2Yt dW\u0302 QMt ,\nand W\u0302 QM is a QM-Brownian motion.\nIn this special case, the problem solution becomes remarkably similar to the full information solution\nwith the proviso that the market price of risk of the nontraded asset, \u03b8 = \u03bd\/\u03b2, is replaced by the random\nprocess \u03b8(t, Yt ). In particular, the optimal hedging strategy for the claim will also be given by a formula\nsimilar to that in Proposition 2.\nIt is feasible that analytic formulae for the indifference price and optimal hedging strategy can be\nderived in this case. This is in progress, as is a numerical solution of the general partial information\nmodel, based upon finite-difference solution of the PDE (25). The aim will be to determine if, with\npartial information and Bayesian updating of the drift parameter estimates, the optimal hedging strategy\nis indeed superior to the BS-style strategy that does not require estimation of the drift parameters.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have developed an efficient approach, based on enhanced analytic approximations for indifference\nprices and optimal hedging strategies, for examining the impact of drift parameter uncertainty on the\n350 M. MONOYIOS\noptimal hedging of a claim on a nontraded asset. This showed that the effect of parameter misestimation\ncan be highly destructive, calling into question whether optimal hedging really is an improvement over a\nBS-style hedge that does not rely on drift parameter estimation. We then developed a filtering approach\nto incorporate Bayesian learning into the drift parameter estimation, and we were able to reduce this\nproblem to one in which the HJB equation increased in dimensionality by only one dimension, compared\nto the full information case. Finally, we were able to treat analytically the special case where the agent\nhas precise knowledge of the stock price drift, while being uncertain of the nontraded asset price drift.\nThis approach shows promise, opening the possibility of incorporating parameter uncertainty into the\noptimal hedging program. The efficacy of such strategies will be the subject of forthcoming work, which\nwill require efficient numerical solution of a 3D PDE. This will allow the optimal hedge to be tested\nover a large number of simulated asset price histories so that the terminal hedging error distribution can\nbe computed. An empirical implementation over real data, as was done in the full information case in\nMonoyios (2004b), will also be a significant topic for future research.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was presented at the 2006 SIAM Conference on Financial Mathematics and Engineering,\nBoston.
