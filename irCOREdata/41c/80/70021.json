INTRODUCTION\nMultipactor is generally considered a resonant electron phenomenon\n(see for example [1]) that occurs in generic RF systems. Although\nthere are applications where multipactor can be harnessed, such as the\nAlenotron (see [2]), generally multipactor is considered a parasitic phe-\nnomenon that degrades system performance.\nMultipactor occurs in vacuum systems due to the impact of RF ener-\ngized electrons with the RF structure causing the emission of secondary\nelectrons. When the motion of secondary electrons locks to a particular\nphase of the RF field this process repeats, and if on average more than\none electron is produced at each impact then the electron population\ngrows rapidly.\nIn this brief, we focus on the role that electron reflection at the sur-\nfaces plays in multipactor discharges. A primary electron with energy\nEp incident upon an interface will either be scattered elastically or in-\nelastically, or be transmitted across the interface. The transmitted elec-\ntrons can then excite electrons within the material. These secondary\nelectrons travel diffusively and, if close enough to the surface, escape.\nThere are a number of numerical simulation codes for predicting\nmultipactor each with various pros and cons.Many of these simulations\nuse the semi-empirical approach derived by Vaughan [1] to determine\nsecondary emission. Vaughan\u2019s formulism is based on a semi-empir-\nical fit to the total secondary electron yield for a given material. This\nformulism is essentially an integration of the energy distribution of\nemitted electrons over a range of primary electron energies. Hence, in-\nformation about energy distributions and probability of reflection and\nsecondary creation are combined into a formwhere access to this infor-\nmation is not possible. In essence the model assumes that all electrons\nleaving the material do so with an energy distribution commensurate\nwith that of a secondary electron, hence electron reflection is not ac-\ncounted for. Also many codes use macroparticles instead of individual\nelectrons, where the macroparticle represents a large number of elec-\ntrons all located at the same point, with identical momentum. The use\nof macroparticles means that information about the energy distribu-\ntion cannot accurately be resolved and the statistical nature of elec-\ntron reflection and emission is at best integrated over and effectively\nsmoothed out, which in many cases is a useful assumption to make.\nThis brief shows that the statistical nature of electron reflection can ef-\nfect the multipacting behavior of a RF structure.\nManuscript received March 1, 2005; revised April 14, 2005. The review of\nthis brief was arranged by Editor W. L. Menninger.\nThe author is with the Department of Engineering, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster LA1 4YR, U.K.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TED.2005.851854\nThe importance of using single electron models that incorporate\nelectron reflection in multipactor simulations has been recognized by\nmany authors [3], as reflected electrons can enter regions of phase\nspace unavailable to true secondaries or the initial primary electron.\nAlthough some approaches have been developed that incorporate\nelectron reflection to study multipactor, [4], [5], they have been quite\nlimited in application or study.\nRecent work by Furman and Pivi as given in [6] has led to an\nemission model that incorporates reflection, making the distinction be-\ntween the different probabilities for secondary emission and inelastic\nand elastic scattering. This is a probabilistic model based on a broad\nphenomenological fit to data for the secondary-emission yield and the\nemitted-energy spectrum, which gives a very good fit to experimental\nsecondary emission yield (SEY) data. There are a number of user-de-\nfined parameters used by the Furman and Pivi algorithm, and a large\nnumber of steps in the algorithm to be performed for each electron\npresent in the system.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nIn this brief, reflection is considered to consist of two forms, elastic\nand inelastically scattered electrons. Superelastic collisions, where an\nelectron is reflectedwith a higher energy than at collision, are negligible\nunder the conditions in which multipactor usually occurs and neglected\nin this brief. For a given RF structure multipactor can occur over a huge\nregion of parameter space, and as such it is necessary to check for the\noccurrence of multipactor systematically over the intended region of\nparameter space the RF structure is intended to operate. This generally\nmeans checking for multipactor over the range of frequency and power\nof the RF structure\u2019s intended operation. This coupled with the fact that\nthere are in excess of 104 electrons in the structure at any time, implies\nwe need an algorithm that determines the outcome of each electron im-\npact quickly. To achieve this, the model used in this brief is similar to\nthat of [4] and [5] except that single electrons and not macroparticles\nare used. This ensures the statistical distributions for the different elec-\ntron species are preserved.\nIn this brief, it is considered that when an electron strikes the surface,\nthere is a probabilityRe that the electron is reflected elastically, with a\ndeparture energy Ed equal to the impact energy Ep. There is also the\nprobability Ri that the electron will be reflected inelastically, with de-\nparture energyEd between 20%\u201399.99% of the impact energyEp. The\nreason for the lower 20% bound is to insure the model reproduces the\nSEY experimental results of [9] as explained below. If the electron is\nnot reflected then it is transmitted across the interface into the material,\nand if Emin \u0014 Ep \u0014 Emax then n secondary electrons are created\nwhere n is an integer chosen from a uniform distribution in the range\n1 : \u000emax. The emission energy of the secondary electrons is taken at\nrandom from a Gaussian distribution. A Box\u2013Muller transformation is\nused to transform a uniformly distributed random variable to a random\nvariable with a Gaussian distribution [7]. Where the transformation is\nchosen such that the resulting secondary electron emission energy dis-\ntribution is given by\nf(Es) =\n1\n2\u0019\u001b\ne (1)\nwhere Es is the secondary electron energy Ep is the primary electron\nenergy, and \u001b = 0:2Ep=2:355.\nThe model for the creation of secondary electrons follows that of\nVaughan\u2019s model [1], where\nEmin =200 eV (2)\nEmax =1500 eV (3)\n\u000emax =3: (4)\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University.

To ensure our\nsimple SEYmodel reproduces quantitative results similar to those seen\nexperimentally without varying the reflection coefficients as a function\nof energy it was found necessary to place a lower bound on the energy\ndistribution of the inelastic reflected electrons of 20%.\nThe use of fixed probabilities with such a simple model yields a very\nfast algorithm for determining electron surface interactions.\nThis simple SEY model reproduces much of the quantitative\nbehavior seen experimentally. The derivative of the electron\nyield with respect to the primary energy, d\u000e=dE, for electrons\nwith Ep = 100 eV (< Emin) and primary electrons with\nEp = 300 eV (> Emin) behaves the same as that seen experi-\nmentally in [9]. Considering the contribution to the total yield \u000e from\njust the reflected electrons shown in Fig. 1, we find by comparing\nFig. 1 with Fig. 2 from [9] that the simple SEY model used here\nquantitatively reproduces the experimental results of [9].\nTo study the generic role of reflection in multipactor discharges we\nconsider an infinite parallel-plate geometry, with a separation (d) of 1\nmm. The method used by the algorithm to determine the occurrence of\nmultipactor is based on the enhanced counter function (see for example\n[11]) and rate of growth of electron population, as measured over 300\nRF cycles at each point in frequency and electric field. The enhanced\ncounter function is effectively a measure of total number of electrons,\nafter several (e.g., 10 or 20) impacts, repeated over this interval.\nDue to the simplicity of this geometry the electric field is determined\nanalytically and the electron trajectories are calculated using fourth-\norder Runga\u2013Kuta numerical integration. The use of an analytic field\nsolution proves computationally faster and more accurate than using\na particle in cell technique, where the field is only calculated at cell\nnodes or elements, hence some degree of interpolation has to occur\nto determine the EM field at an arbitrary point in space. As we are\nonly interested in the onset of multipactor on metal surfaces, where\nthe effects of space charge are negligible, in this brief, space charge is\nneglected in line with the approach used in [1], [4], and [5].\nIII. RESULTS\nFig. 2 shows a section of a Hatch diagram [12] for a parallel-plate\ngeometry. The shaded region shows where the first mode of multi-\npactor occurs for a given frequency Hz and electric field V. Outside\nof the narrow shaded bands the kinematics are such that multipactor is\nnot possible. Band (A) shown in light gray in Fig. 2 shows the region\nwhere \u201cclassic\u201d first-order multipactor is predicted. This is the regime\nfor first-order multipactor as determined in [1], where electron reflec-\ntion is ignored and all secondary electrons are emitted with an energy\nof 1 eV. Band (B) is calculated by extending the formulism of [1] by\nFig. 1. Showing the contribution to the total yield \u000e from just the reflected\nelectrons.\nFig. 2. Hatch diagram for parallel plate geometry, separated by 1 mm, that\nshows electric field (V) magnitude versus frequency (Hz), shaded regions\nshow where first-order multipactor will occur. The solid band (A) represents\nthe multipactor regions with no reflection and a fixed secondary emission\nenergy of 1 eV. (B) Represents the multipactor regions with no reflection and a\nGaussian secondary energy distribution. (C) Represents the multipactor regions\nwith reflection (R = 0:1; R = 0:2) and a Gaussian secondary energy\ndistribution.\nusing a Gaussian energy distribution for secondary electron energies as\noutlined in Section II, again with no electron reflection. The effect of\nthe Gaussian energy distribution is to broaden the region over which\nmultipactor occurs (see for example [13]). Also band (B) incorporates\n1\u20132 hybrid mode multipactor as discussed in [14], which also broadens\nthe band over which multipactor occurs. Band (C) incorporates the full\nmodel for electron yield as discussed in Section II, where the reflec-\ntion coefficients are taken as Re = 0:1 and Ri = 0:2. As seen from\nFig. 1, band (C), the inclusion of reflection broadens the multipactor\nbands even further.\nTo study the behavior of the electron population by species (elastic,\ninelastic, and secondary) the evolution of the electron population at\nthree frequency points from the Hatch diagram were considered: Point\n1, outside the region capable of multipactor discharge, at f = 2 GHz,\nEo = 10\n6; Point 2, in the middle of the classic multipactor band at\nf = 4 GHz, Eo = 106; and point 3 at the edge of the neo-multipactor\nband at f = 5GHz,Eo = 106. At each of these points the evolution of\nsecondary, elastically scattered and inelastically scattered electron pop-\nulations was monitored and the effects of including reflection studied.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University.

FOR MULTIPACTOR TO OCCUR\nWITH h\u000ei = 2 THE TOTAL MUST BE >0.5\nTo ensure seed electrons covered all points over the phase of the RF\nfield, packets of ten electrons were released from plate 1, each with an\nenergy of 1 eV, at 1\u000e intervals over the whole (360\u000e) of the first RF\ncycle. The reason for choosing ten electrons was rather arbitrary, but\ndoes insure that on average from each package, three electrons will be\nreflected, and seven will be transmitted over the surface barrier into the\nmaterial.\nFirst, we analyze the evolution of the electron population at Point\n1 (f = 2 GHz, Eo = 106) outside the regime known to suffer multi-\npactor, as shown in Fig. 2. Initially the electron population was found to\nincrease as seed electrons were injected over the first RF cycle. Due to\nthe RF topology electrons impacting on the plates had insufficient en-\nergy to generate secondary electrons and, as expected from [1], during\nthe second RF cycle the electron population decayed exponentially to\nzero, hence no multipactor discharge is possible.\nThe second point considered, point 2 (f = 4 GHz, Eo = 106) lies\nin the middle of the first mode multipactor band of Fig. 2. This point\ncovers the classic first-order multipactor of [1] with no reflection and\nsecondaries have an emission energy of 1 eV. Point 2 is also within the\nregime where the emitted secondary electrons have a Gaussian energy\ndistribution, as covered in [13].\nThe evolution of the electron population at Point 2 was studied both\nincluding reflection (Re = 0:1 and Ri = 0:2), and without reflection\n(Re = Ri = 0). In both cases the electron population was seen to\nincrease exponentially, in accordancewith the results from [1] and [13],\nresulting in a multipactor discharge.\nThe relative numbers of electrons by species capable, at impact, of\nsecondary electron creation, per RF cycle, are shown in Table I for point\n2, both including electron reflection and without electron reflection.\nNotice that at point 2 the total percentage of electrons at impact ca-\npable of secondary creation is, including reflection 76%, and without\nreflection is 75%.\nPoint 3 (f = 5 GHz and Eo = 106) lies at the very edge of the\nfirst-mode neo-multipactor band, where traditionally multipactor is not\npredicted to occur. The evolution of the electron population at Point\n3 was studied both including reflection (Re = 0:1 and Ri = 0:2),\nand without reflection (Re = Ri = 0). In the case without reflection\n(Re = Ri = 0) at Point 3 the electron population was observed to\ndecay exponentially to zero, hence no multipactor discharge occurs, in\nagreement with the results from [1] and [13]. In the case where electron\nreflection (Re = 0:1 andRi = 0:2)is included the electron population\nwas seen to increase linearly resulting in amultipactor discharge, contra\nto the results of [1] and [13] where reflection is ignored.\nThe relative number of electrons by species capable at impact\nof secondary electron creation, per RF cycle, are shown in Table I\nfor point 3, both including electron reflection and without electron\nreflection. When reflection is ignored only 44% of impacts are\ncapable of secondary electron creation, the population decreases and\nno multipactor occurs. When reflection is incorporated 52.4% of all\nelectron impacts are within the energy range capable of creating\nsecondary electrons.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this brief, it has been demonstrated that the inclusion of electron\nreflection from the surfaces of vacuum electronic systems predicts the\noccurrence of multipactor where it would not otherwise occur. The re-\nsults in Table I give an indication as to why electron reflection enables\nmultipactor to occur over a larger regime. In our SEYmodel the average\nnumber of electrons created for a given electron creation event, h\u000ei, is\ntwo. For h\u000ei = 2, if more than 50% of electron impacts are capable\nof secondary production then in each RF cycle the electron population\nincreases by a factor greater than 1, i.e., the number of electrons in the\nsystem grows. Likewise, if the average number of secondaries created\nper impact increases then multipactor will occur for a lower percentage\nof impacts capable of secondary creation. For example, if h\u000ei = 3 and\n>34%of electron impacts result in secondary creation then the electron\npopulation will increase by a factor greater than 1 for each RF cycle,\nresulting in multipactor.\nIf h\u000ei <1 then multipactor is not possible as the population growth\nfactor will always be less than 1. The incorporation of reflection effec-\ntively enlarges the phase range over which multipactor can occur. As\nreflected electrons generally have a higher energy than the true secon-\ndaries they can travel further through a retarding phase of the RF field.\nAlso secondaries created during the retarding phase of the RF pushed\nback into the plate can reflect off the plate, \u201cbouncing\u201d along the sur-\nface until the phase of the RF changes.\nAs discussed earlier the effect of incorporating electron reflection\nis to broaden the phase range over which multipacting electrons can\nexist. These new points in phase space are numerous but unstable, and\nelectrons will hop from phase point to phase point, with some man-\naging to hop onto a stable phase point. A full discussion on phase sta-\nbility of multipactor and electron reflection will be presented in a later\npublication.\nAlthough the reflection model used in this brief is rather simplistic\nthe quantitative behavior of the SEY is capable of reproducing exper-\nimental results, and the inclusion of a more accurate model will most\nprobably add little to the analysis.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe author would like to thank the High PoweRFaraday Partnership,\nPPARC, DTSL, and E2V for their support of this work.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
