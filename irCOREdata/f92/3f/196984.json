INTRODUCTION \nForeign direct investment is expected to contribute to the recipient country \ndevelopment. For this reason, there is a lot of research on what attracts FDI to \nparticular locations (e.g. Chakrabarti, 2001; Blonigen, 2005; Bevan and Estrin, 2004). \nThe determinants of FDI are usually identified as a result of a cross-country \ninvestigation, with the focus on the target-country characteristics, with a view to \ndesigning relevant policies to attract more FDI. There is also some  literature on the \nsource country determinants, mirroring to a great extent the factors identified in the \ncross-country studies. Such studies were conducted for selected countries  only (see \ne.g. Grosse and Trevino, 1996, for the US; Kimino et al., 2007, for Japan; Thomas \nand Grosse, 2001, for Mexico; Pan, 2003, for China).  Refocusing on the source rather \nthan target countries has its advantages. Namely, apart from contributing to the \nunderstanding of the determinants of FDI, it can also provide some insight into the \npotential effect of investment on the host country. \n \nThere has been growing interest in the FDI in the Arab countries, partly driven by the \nconcern about  the relatively small amount of investment in relation to their position \nin the world economy (Bolbol and Fatheldin, 2006).  Gemayel (2004) demonstrates \nthat instability associated with investment risk is critical in explaining the level of \nforeign direct investment for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.  \nMina (2007) examines the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and concludes that \nwhile the quality of institutions, infrastructure and trade openness attract FDI, the role \nplayed by oil resources is not straightforward. Conventional factors attracting FDI \nsuch as market size, economic integration via international trade, wage rates, and country \nrisk, are investigated by Abdel-Rahman (2007) in the time series analysis of the FDI \n 3 \ninflows into Saudi Arabia. The Granger causality tests show that Saudi Arabia  was \nsuccessful in attracting FDI because of its overall economic performance, but the FDI \ninflows may not have affected growth. This coincides with Sadik and Bolbol\u2019s  (2001) \nconclusion that FDI generated spillover have not yet materialised in the Arab countries. \nThis sober assessment should justify more emphasis on the sources of FDI rather than \nmere preoccupation with the factors attracting  FDI into particular countries or regions. \nOur paper addresses this gap in the studies of FDI in Arab countries by analysing the FDI \ninto Saudi Arabia, one of the largest economies in the region, in terms of source country \ncharacteristics. The paper contributes to the existing FDI literature in a number of ways. \nFirst, it provides a comprehensive analysis of inward FDI for a country that falls in- \nbetween traditional developing and developed economies. Second, we draw attention to \nthe sensitivity of the results to the specification of the dependent variable. Using a count \nmeasure of foreign entries produces results different from the ones obtained when FDI \nactivity is measured by investment expenditure. Finally, our results confirm the need to \naccount for unobservable country-specific effects in order to identify the determinants of \nFDI and link them to the characteristics of investing countries.  \n \nWe use a gravity-type model going beyond traditional  economic size and geographical  \ndistance dimensions, to include some socio-economic and political  variables. The \nnumber of investment projects as well as total investment inflow are examined for a \npanel of 33 countries in the period 1980-2005 using negative binomial and Tobit \nregressions respectively. The data on the size and origin of individual foreign \ninvestments are obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Commerce and supplemented \nwith the information on the home countries drawn from different sources, such as the \nWorld Development Indicators and the Hofstede (2001) cultural distance indices. \n \n 4 \nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the \ndeterminants of FDI and provides a rationale for our choice of the explanatory \nvariables. Data sources and empirical model are discussed in Section 3. Empirical \nresults are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions. \n \n \n2. THE DETERMINANTS OF FDI  \nThe studies of the determinants of FDI traditionally rely on the Dunning (1992) \neclectic theory built on the OLI (ownership, location and internalisation) advantages. \nMarkusen and Maskus (2002), on the other hand, classify theoretical explanations of \nFDI as falling into two broad  categories. The factor-proportion model postulates that \na multi-national firm integrates production vertically, and locates stages of production \nin different countries on the basis of differences in relative factor prices resulting from \ndifferent relative factor supplies. By contrast, the proximity-concentration or \nhorizontal model assumes that production abroad is an alternative to exporting and a \ndecision to locate subsidiaries abroad is a trade-off between proximity to markets and \nthe economies arising from concentrated production (Brainard, 1997).  \n \nTheoretical models imply that factors such as proximity and market size make certain \ncountries attractive locations for FDI. In order to analyse the importance of these \nfactors in a  cross-country setting a gravity model, originally derived for trade flows, \nis used. Apart from traditional size and distance variables, a variety of factors \nencouraging and deterring foreign investment are used. Wei (2000) focussed on the \nimpact of the level of corruption on the FDI flows. Tong (2005) introduces the size of \nthe ethnic Chinese population in the home and host country to investigate the impact \n 5 \nof ethnic Chinese networks on bilateral FDI. The importance of the quality of \ninstitutions is considered by B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2007). For the European \ntransitional economies the level and method of privatisation (Carstensen and Toubal, \n2004) or transition progress indicator (Altomonte, 2000) are used. Such studies aim to \nexplain why investors choose one country over another. \n \nThe studies of source country determinants have a different focus. Their interest lies \nin a single target country and the characteristics of the countries the investment \noriginates from. In general, a range of economic, socio-political, and geographic \nfactors are hypothesized to be important country-of-origin determinants of FDI but \nthe set of determinants varies between the studies to fit in with the circumstances of \nthe host country.  Thomas and Grosse (2001) introduce wage differentials to test the \nhypothesis about efficiency-seeking maquiladora FDI into Mexico. Zhao (2003) \nincludes market, financial and risk factors in order to explain FDI in China. Kimino et \nal. (2007) justify their emphasis on macroeconomic variables on the grounds that \nmost of the investment into Japan is \u2018market-seeking\u2019 and such an investment is very \nresponsive to changes in market size or exchange rate differentials. Our choice of \nexplanatory variables is influenced by the existing studies of source country \ncharacteristics. However, for a country such as Saudi Arabia, the importance of intra-\nArab investment flows has to be taken into account. Bolbol and Fatheldin (2006) posit \nthat while foreign investments are in general governed by economic fundamentals, the \nintra-Arab investments are likely to be driven by factors based on proximity and \ncontacts.  \n \n 6 \nOur approach follows the gravity model framework, with traditional  elements, such \nas GDP and distance, geographical as well as cultural. Existing economic links are \nmeasured by the amount of bilateral trade. We also consider the general economic \nclimate in the source country, measured by the index of economic freedom, as a factor  \nthat might stimulate outward investment. Finally, we look at the degree of similarity \nbetween Saudi Arabia and investing countries using the Hofstede (2001) index as well \nas the GDP per capita. Below, we justify the inclusion of each explanatory variable in \nmore detail and comment on the expected effect on the inflow of FDI. \n \na. Source country market size \n Grosse and Trevino (1996) indicate that large economies would contain a large \nnumber of firms that are capable of expanding their operations in foreign markets. \nLarger and more affluent economies should have capital and resources, such as \ntechnical knowledge and marketing expertise necessary for operating abroad and \nmeeting possibly different consumer demand in a target country. In most of the \nprevious studies, market size turned out to be  one of the major significant positive \ndeterminants of FDI (e.g. Grosse and Trevino, 1996 for the US, Kimino et al., 2007 \nfor Japan, Gao, 2005 for China). However, for Mexico the size of source country \nturned out to be negatively related to the level of FDI (Thomas and Grosse, 2001). \nNevertheless, we expect that there will be a positive relationship between source \ncountry size and FDI. \n \nb. Distance \nGreater distance between the source country and host country may discourage the \nflows of FDI. In the trade context, the geographical distance refers to the cost of \n 7 \ntransportation and the barriers to trade. For FDI, greater distance implies not only \ntransportation cost but also difficulties in obtaining information or managing the \nbusiness as well as legal, institutional, and other costs. Most studies find a negative \nrelationship between distance and the flow of FDI into the country (see e.g. Gao, \n2005) for China. However, Liu et al. (1997) find the geographical distance variable \nstatistically insignificant, which they attribute to the progress in transport and \ncommunication. Also, contrary to the results from other studies, Thomas and Grosse \n(2001) found a positive relationship between distance and FDI. This unexpected \nfinding might be the result of the way they modelled the investment from the US to \nMexico. \n \nIt is not just geographical distance but also cultural differences that are expected to \nreduce the flow of FDI between countries. Cultural similarities are often captured by a \ncommon language or the existence of a common border (e.g. Gao, 2005). In the case \nof Saudi Arabia, all neighbouring and close-by countries are also Arab, so we do not \ninclude a language or border dummy. Instead, we use the Hofstede (2001) index as a \nproxy for transaction costs arising from cultural differences. Cultural values are \nevaluated for individual countries\n1\n  in four main categories: power distance, \nuncertainty avoidance, individualism\/collectivism, and masculinity\/femininity. We  \nmeasure cultural distance by the sum of the absolute values of the differences between \nthe home country and the Saudi rating for each of the four dimensions.  \n \nWe also measure similarities between Saudi Arabia and the countries the investment \noriginates from by the difference between source country GDP per capita and Saudi \n                                                 \n1\n Some 40 countries are included in the Hofstede (2001) study but only a single score is given to Arab \ncountries. \n 8 \nGDP per capita. In the context of trade models, similarities in the per capita incomes \nof the trading partners lead to more trade,  in accordance  with the Linder hypothesis \n(McPherson et al., 2001). Gross and Trevino (1996) expect a similar link to hold for \nFDI, so that firms from more affluent countries should be more likely to invest in the \nUS. We include the difference in the per capita incomes without a prior expectation \nabout the sign but as an attempt to identify the types of countries which invest in \nSaudi Arabia. \n \nc. Economic freedom \nThe studies of the determinants of FDI invariably come up with the conclusion that \nthe economic stability of the host country, the quality of institutions and the  general \nclimate for foreign investment have been important in attracting FDI (e.g. Gemayel, \n2004, M\u00e9on and Sekkat, 2004). The concept of economic freedom, measured by the \nHeritage Foundation Index, embraces the removal of legislative obstacles as well as \nthe creation of a general climate stimulating investment. Many empirical studies \nconfirm that economic freedom has a positive effect on the inflow of FDI. For \nexample, Quazi (2007) found that economic freedom increased FDI  in  East Asian \ncountries. Similarly, Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles (2003) found a positive relationship \nbetween economic freedom and FDI in Latin America.  \n \nWhile economic freedom and stability of the host country play an important role in \nattracting FDI, the significance of economic freedom of the source country is not \nclear. A high index of economic freedom might indicate the environment conducive \nto entrepreneurship necessary for foreign expansion so, consequently, a positive \nrelationship between economic freedom of the home country and FDI outflow is to be \n 9 \nexpected. On the other hand, a poor business climate and higher risk might stimulate \nFDI outflows to relatively more stable economies, implying a negative relationship. \nThe empirical evidence here is mixed. Kimino et al. (2007) conclude that a stable and \nfavourable business climate in the home countries increases FDI inflows from these \ncountries to Japan. However, in their analysis of FDI in Mexico, Thomas and Grosse \n(2001) show that as political risk increases and business environment in the home \ncountry deteriorates, firms are more likely to escape or diversify away from that \npolitical risk by investing abroad. We include an index of economic freedom as a way \nof investigating the characteristics of countries the investment comes from. \n \nd. Bilateral trade  \nExports and FDI are two alternative modes for multinationals to enter foreign \nmarkets. Thus, at a firm level, trade and FDI are often substitutes. At an aggregate \nlevel, it is not clear whether FDI and trade are substitutes or complements. The view \nthat trade and FDI complement each other rests on the assumption that engagement in \ninternational trade improves the ability to undertake FDI. Exporting requires less \nresources than FDI and offers a way of obtaining more information about the market \nand business environment in the host country before making a commitment.  \n \nMost studies confirm the positive and complementary effect of trade on FDI. Grosse \nand Thomas (2001) find strong support for existing levels of trade being positively \nassociated with FDI in Mexico. Liu et al. (1997) identify a high degree of integration \nbetween a host and home country represented by exports and imports as an important \ndeterminant of FDI in China. More recent evidence for China in Zhao (2003) also \nconfirms that FDI and bilateral trade complement each other. In contrast to this, \n 10 \nKimino et al. (2007) find  a substitution rather than complementary effect between \nexport performance and FDI, which they attribute to the nature of foreign investment \nin Japan. With such conflicting results, we intend to investigate the substitutability or \ncomplementarity between FDI and trade without any prior expectations about the \nrelationship between the two. \n \ne. Past investment \nPast inward investment can be a significant determinant of current investment. \nAgglomeration effects, measured by the number of previous FDI entries into a \nparticular location, have very strong impact on attracting future investment in List \n(2001). Girma (2002) confirms the importance of agglomeration effects, where new \ninvestments cluster in the sectors already characterised by a strong foreign presence. \nClearly, past investment might be an important consideration when choosing between \ndifferent locations, be it different countries, regions or industries. With a single host \ncountry, and an emphasis on source country characteristics, the importance of past \ninvestment is better seen in the context of an approach stressing the fixed setup cost of \nFDI (Razin et al., 2003). Previous FDI indicates that an investor has already born a \ncost in the past and this may help to reduce  the setup cost of a new investment. \nFollowing this interpretation, we expect a positive impact of past FDI on future \ninvestment.   \n   \n \n3. DATA DESCRIPTION AND EMPIRICAL MODEL   \nIn our study of FDI activities, we focus on the source country determinants of FDI \nflows, with the purpose of trying to identify the characteristics of countries that tend \n 11 \nto invest in Saudi Arabia. We use a unique dataset obtained from the Saudi Ministry \nof Commerce which records all domestic and foreign investments. This data lists all \nforeign projects registered with the Saudi government, thereby representing all \ninstances of foreign entry into Saudi Arabia. For each individual project there is \ninformation about the date of registration, the size of investment in terms of financial \nexpenditure, the industry and geographical location of the investment, and most \nimportantly, the country of origin.  \n \nAlthough the data on investments goes back to 1960, initially very few foreign \nprojects take place, so we limit our analysis to the period 1980-2005. In this period \nover 6000 foreign investments occur but for some countries only a very small number \nof projects takes place over all those years. Some investments originate from offshore \nfinancial centres such as the British Virgin Islands but we exclude these as UNCTAD \n(2006) recognises that with such investments it is difficult to identify the actual \ncountry of origin. In the end our panel consists of 33 countries. Investments originate \nfrom developed countries like USA, UK, Japan, Germany and France and developing \ncountries from afar as well as from the  region. For each country-year combination we \ntotal up the number of projects as well as the overall investment expenditure. In terms \nof the number of projects, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon are the leading investors. \nHowever, the largest overall investment flows come from the United States, Japan, \nFrance and Sweden. \n \nOn the basis of the discussion of possible explanations of the inward investment in \nSection 2, we postulate the following panel model to explain variation in the source \ncountry investment into Saudi Arabia: \n 12 \n \nFDIit = f (Sizeit , Distancei , Cultural Distancei , Economic Distanceit ,  \nEconomic Freedomi , Bilateral Tradeit )    (1) \n \nwhere the country subscript i varies from 1 to 33, and the time subscript t varies from \n1 to 25 to cover the years 1980-2005. We also investigate the impact of past \ninvestments in some specifications. The definitions of variables are summarised in \nTable 1 and the correlation matrix is given in Table 2. As the nearby countries are \nsimilar in terms of income and economic and cultural environment, the respective \nvariables are relatively highly correlated. The dependent variable is measured in two \nways: as a number of projects from country i in year t and as a logarithm of the total \nreal investment inflow from a given country in a given year. Size, geographical \ndistance and exports and imports are expressed using the logarithms. FDI inflows  are \nassessed on the basis of the register of new investment projects maintained by the \nSaudi Ministry of Commerce. Bilateral trade flows come from the IMF Direction of \nTrade Statistics. The Hofstede cultural indices and the Heritage  economic freedom \nindices come from the relevant websites. The remaining variables are obtained from \nthe World Bank World Development Indicators. \n \n In order to estimate  the overall number of projects as well as total investment, the \ntechniques chosen have to be  suitable for modelling a salient feature of an investment \nflow  from a panel of countries, namely, that there might be countries from which \nthere is no investment in a particular year. First, the dependent variable is the number \nof projects originating from a particular country in a given year and it assumes non-\nnegative integer values. The common assumption is that such count data is generated \n 13 \nby a Poisson-like process, with the conditional mean equal to the conditional variance. \nHowever, in empirical applications the variance often exceeds the mean leading to \noverdispersion and necessitating other approaches to modelling (Winkelmann and \nZimmermann, 1995).  We choose a negative binomial model (Long, 1997) and verify \nwhether it is appropriate for our data.  \n \nApart from the number of foreign projects, we also use total investment as a \ndependent variable. Although there might be some country-year observations with \nzero FDI,  ignoring these zero entries would lead to serious mis-specification. This \npoint was raised in the context of trade models, where McPherson et al. (2000) stress \nthe need for using a censored dependent variable in order to include information on all \npotential trading partners even if a country in question exported zero dollars worth of \ngoods to that potential partner. Razin et al. (2003) treat FDI as a twofold decision: \nwhether to invest at all in a particular country and how much to invest. Therefore, the \nmost appropriate method of modelling FDI is to jointly estimate  a participation \nequation and  the volume of FDI equation by employing the Heckman selection \nprocedure. Linders and de Groot (2006) also recognise the importance of accounting \nfor the occurrence of zero flows. They argue that the choice of method should be \ndriven by both economic and econometric considerations.   In their particular \napplication the sample selection model turns out to be the preferable approach. We \nalso consider different methods of modelling to deal with zero flows. \n \n4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS  \nApart from traditional determinants of FDI used in the gravity model, we also \ninvestigate the impact of past investment. In the context of panel data with non-zero \n 14 \nvalues of dependent variables, this would lead to a dynamic panel data approach (see \ne.g. Driffield, 2002) with the possibility of investigating the lags. With our dependent \nvariable being either count data or flow data with a substantial number of zeros, we \nlook for a consistent way of introducing past investment. Somewhat arbitrary, we \nmeasure past investment as an average number of investment projects in the previous \nthree years. Past investment defined in the above way enters the list of explanatory \nvariables in the negative binomial regression and is also used  to test the hypothesis of \nfixed setup cost of FDI flows (Razin et al., 2004).  \n \nOur initial interest is in the number of foreign investments from a particular country in \na particular year. The results are presented in Table 3. We start with the simple pooled \nnegative binomial regression, ignoring possible country-specific effects. Then we \nexplore the panel nature of the data in the fixed and random effects negative binomial \nregressions. In the notes to Table 3 the results of various statistical tests are included. \nFirst, a test of the overdispersion parameter alpha is carried out. When alpha is zero, \nthe negative binomial distribution is equivalent to a Poisson distribution. In this case, \nalpha is significantly different from zero confirming that the negative binomial model  \nis more appropriate. The second test favours the random effects model over a pooled \nregression with a single constant term. A pooled regression does not control for \nheterogeneity among investing countries and might lead to statistically meaningless \nresults. Both the fixed and random effects versions produce similar results and the \nHausman statistic suggests that the random effects version is statistically justifiable.  \n \nWhen the inflow of FDI is measured by the number of foreign projects (Table 3), the \nmain gravity type variables, namely size and geographical distance, display the \n 15 \nexpected signs and are statistically significant in all cases. The coefficient on the \ncultural differences has the right sign but is statistically significant only in the pooled \nregression. Once country-specific heterogeneity is controlled for, cultural differences \nbecome statistically insignificant. Economic distance, measured by the difference in \nthe income per capita, is negatively related to the number of foreign projects in all \nversions,  suggesting  that Saudi Arabia might receive investment from the countries \nat a lower level of development. The index of economic  freedom is always positive \nand significant in all specifications, so investments originate  from countries \ncharacterised by an advanced business and investment environment. \n \nThe link between FDI and trade is not clear. A positive coefficient on the exports \nfrom the source country to Saudi Arabia suggests that penetration by trade \naccompanies FDI. However, exports (to Saudi Arabia) are significant in the pooled \nregression only. Imports are insignificant in all  three specifications, so the existence \nof some economic links between the countries, such as those involved in importing, \ndoes not seem important. Familiarity with the host economy, as indicated by the past \ninvestment in the most recent period (preceding three years), has a positive impact on \nFDI in the pooled regression and in the random effects version. \n \nWe also analyse FDI in terms of investment inflows rather than the number of \nprojects. With the dependent  variable being the value of investment inflow and  \ncensored at zero, we consider three possible approaches to dealing with the zero \nflows. First, we estimate investment by OLS using only positive observations. Then a \nTobit model is used to take into account the observations where no investment from a \nparticular country in a particular year takes place. We pool all the year-country \n 16 \nobservations as well as explore the panel nature of the data in the random effects \nmodel\n2\n. The Tobit model assumes that the same set of factors determines the value of \nuncensored observation (how much is invested) and whether an observation is \ncensored (whether a country invests in Saudi Arabia at all). This assumption is \nrelaxed in the Heckman\u2019s sample selection approach (Heckman, 1979). We use \nHeckman\u2019s two-step procedure to estimate the flow of FDI and to identify the factors \naffecting  participation in FDI. The results are presented in Table 4, and the list of \nexplanatory variables is the same as in Table 3.  \n \nFirst, it is important to employ a technique catering  for the presence of zero flows. \nThe OLS estimation based only on non-zero flows provides very little insight into the \ndeterminants of FDI, with economic distance as the only significant variable. The \nTobit results  offer a range of explanations, with many significant variables displaying \nthe expected signs. For the Heckman two-step procedure, the variables affecting  \nselection but not necessarily the size of a flow need to be identified.\n3\n We posit that it \nis past investments that affect selection only, with the remaining variables \ndetermining both the decision to invest in Saudi Arabia as well as the amount of FDI. \nPast investment, measured by the number of projects undertaken in the past rather \nthan the overall size of investment, is intended to test the hypothesis of fixed setup \ncosts of FDI flows (Razin et al., 2004). Further discussion is based on the Tobit and \nHeckman results. \n \n                                                 \n2\n Only random effects model is  included as standard econometric packages do not provide an adequate \nestimation method for the fixed effects version (Stata, 2005).   \n3\n Although the procedure can be carried out with the same set of variables, Wooldridge (2006) argues \nfor an exclusion restriction to distinguish sample selection from a misspecified functional form. \n 17 \nWhen the value of investment inflow rather than the number of foreign projects is \nanalysed, a slightly different picture emerges. The size of the source economy remains \nsignificant and positive in most specifications. Geographical distance is no longer an \nobstacle to FDI, although a cultural distance between the source and the recipient \ncountry is. In contrast to the results in Table 3, when the investment activity is \nmeasured by the size of FDI inflow it turns out that the coefficient on economic \ndistance becomes consistently positive. Neither economic freedom nor trade links \nwith the source countries are significant in the Tobit specifications. Past investment \nprojects are a significant determinant only in the pooled Tobit regression but \naccording to the likelihood-ratio test there are significant source-country effects \nmaking inferences from the pooled regression inappropriate.  \n \nThe results for the Heckman model deserve separate discussion. First, there is a large \nnumber of factors affecting selection compared with relatively few  significant \ndeterminants of the size of the flow. Moreover, some of the factors work in the \nopposite direction. This gives support to the selection model as an approach preferred \nover the Tobit model where the same factors affect censored and uncensored \nobservations and the marginal effects display the same sign for both categories. The \nsize of the source country and distance, both geographical and cultural, affect the \nselection into becoming an investor in Saudi Arabia but they do not determine the size \nof the flow. Countries  characterised by a high index of economic freedom and high \nincome per capita are more likely to become investors but the size of investment \ninflow is positively related to economic distance but negatively to economic freedom.  \nFrom the selection equation, there is some evidence that investing in  Saudi Arabia \ndoes not coincide with exporting to this market.  The negative coefficient indicates \n 18 \nthat source countries exporting to Saudi Arabia are less likely to establish production \nfacilities there. Similar,  substitution rather than complementary, effect  was identified \nfor Japan, and Kimino et al. (2007) attribute this to the characteristics of the Japanese \neconomy which make it an unlikely location for outsourcing or an export platform for \nthe region. In the case of Saudi Arabia, more research is required to identify the \nsectors in which FDI occurs in order to provide  satisfactory explanations. \n \nThe inclusion of past investment projects in the selection equation was dictated by an \nattempt to verify the hypothesis of the existence of setup costs of FDI. If setup costs \nplay an important role in determining whether a source country undertakes an \ninvestment, then there should be a negative correlation between  the errors terms of \nthe flow and the participation equation (Razin et al., 2004). In Table 4, past \ninvestment projects are positive and significant in the selection equation. However, \nthe coefficient of correlation between the flow and participation equations (rho), \nalthough negative as expected, turns out to be insignificant.  \n \n \n5. CONCLUSION  \nThe objective of this paper was to investigate to what extent source country \ncharacteristics applied previously to other countries explain the  inflow of FDI  into \nSaudi Arabia. A unique database obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Commerce \nlisting all new investment projects involving foreign ownership was used to construct \na panel of 33 countries for the 1980-2005 period. The number of investment projects \nis estimated using negative binomial regression, and total investment inflow is \nmodelled using the Tobit regression and the Heckman selection procedure, in order to \n 19 \naccount for some country-year observations with zero FDI flows.  The conclusions \ndrawn from the analysis employing panel-based techniques differ from the results \nobtained from pooled regression models. Once unobservable country-specific effects \nare taken into account some coefficients become statistically insignificant. The \ndeterminants of FDI also differ depending on whether foreign investment is measured \nin terms of investment expenditure or the number of individual foreign projects. \nWhen investigating total FDI inflows, it turns out that there is a large number of \nfactors affecting the decision to invest in Saudi Arabia compared with relatively few \ndeterminants of  the actual size of the investment.  \n \nWith Saudi Arabia being a developing  country but with a relatively high income per \ncapita due to oil exports one could expect the determinants of FDI to be different from \nthose for traditional developing or developed countries. Standard gravity type \nexplanations hold to a great extent, with the size of the source economy positively \nrelated and the distance negatively related to the inflow of FDI. It is the geographical \ndistance that hinders investment when FDI is measured in terms of the number of \nforeign projects, while cultural distance matters if FDI is measured by the total \ninvestment expenditure. In many specifications a positive impact of past investments \nis apparent, indicating that  setup cost may be lower for an investing country which \nhas already acquired some familiarity with the Saudi economy via past FDI \ninitiatives. \n \nCertain characteristics of the investing countries are also identified, making it possible \nto speculate about the scope for possible spillovers. It is reassuring that the coefficient \non economic freedom is positive and significant in most specifications as it suggests \n 20 \nthat the investing countries  are characterised by an advanced business environment. \nHowever, it is not clear whether the investment comes from more technologically \nadvanced countries.  The coefficient on economic distance is negative when FDI is \nmeasured by the number of investment projects. The size of investment is positively \nrelated to economic distance suggesting that volume-wise important investments \ncome from countries characterised by high income per capita. The commonly \nacknowledged relationship between FDI and bilateral trade does not apply to Saudi \nArabia and there is some evidence that the countries that export to Saudi Arabia do \nnot invest there.  \n \nCompared with other regions and types of economies, there is a limited amount of \nresearch on FDI in Arab countries. This paper is the first attempt to analyse the inflow \nof FDI into Saudi Arabia from the perspective of source country characteristics. Saudi \nArabia receives FDI from a range of countries, including most advanced industrialised \neconomies as well as neighbouring  Arab countries. Our study demonstrates that some \ndeterminants of inward FDI previously established for developed and developing \ncountries as the target recipients of FDI do not necessarily hold for Saudi Arabia. \nWith the increasing importance of South-South investment recognised by UNCTAD \n(2006), more research using disaggregate data is needed to identify factors affecting \nFDI and attribute them to some unique characteristics of Arab countries and oil \nexporting countries. \n  \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAbdel-Rahman, A-M.
