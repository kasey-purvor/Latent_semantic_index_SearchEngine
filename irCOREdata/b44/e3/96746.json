Introduction\nOne of the central issues in developmental biology is to understand how spatial\npatterns arise as an embryo develops from a single fertilised cell into an adult.\nIn 1952, Alan Turing proposed that a system of interacting chemicals could be\ndriven unstable by diffusion and evolve into a spatial pattern. This was an exam-\nple of self-organisation giving rise to emergent behaviour. Since this paper, there\nhas been a great deal of mathematical research on this model framework, and it\nhas been applied to several systems in development (see, for example, Meinhardt,\nDedicated to the memory of Lee A. Segel, a friend, mentor and inspiration.\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: maini@maths.ox.ac.uk (P. K. Maini).\n982 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\n1995; Murray, 2003). In this era of integrative biology, Turing\u2019s model is one of the\nvery first examples of how integrating simple processes can give rise to complex\noutcomes, in this case, the combination of stabilising processes yields an unstable\nsystem.\nWhen Lee Segel moved into mathematical biology, one of his first interests was\nin the problem of pattern formation and in trying to make sense of the counter-\nintuitive results of Turing\u2019s paper. In 1972, the paper by Segel and Jackson showed\nhow one could understand Turing\u2019s result at a conceptual and intuitive level, with\nan illustrative application in ecology.\nThe Turing model assumed that cells did not move but simply responded to\nchemical cues by differentiating accordingly. However, in other systems it is well-\nknown that cells do move, and the paper by Keller and Segel (1970) was the first\nto show that within the amoeboid cells of the slime mold, pattern formation could\narise as the result of a chemotactic instability. This paper is now a classic and has\nserved as an inspiration for models in many areas of development, as well as in\nmedicine (specifically in models for wound healing and for cancer).\nOne of the main problems with the Turing reaction\u2013diffusion theory for mor-\nphogenesis is that the patterns it produces can be very sensitive to small perturba-\ntions (see, for example, Bard and Lauder, 1974) and thus the model seems inappro-\npriate when applied to robust pattern formation in developmental biology. Dillon\net al. (1994) showed that the judicial choice of boundary conditions could greatly\nincrease the robustness of certain patterns by making other patterning modes in-\nadmissible.\nMore recently, Crampin et al. (1999) showed that domain growth could select\ncertain patterns in a robust manner. Specifically, they showed that an exponentially\ngrowing domain could produce a sequence of mode-doubling pattern transitions,\nbut that this broke down if the growth rate was too high or too low. While they\nwere able to present an explanation for the former behaviour, it was not clear why\nthe latter behaviour occurred.\nPattern sequences featuring mode doubling via regular insertion or splitting of\npeaks are common in diverse biological systems. For example, pigmentation pat-\nterns in fish (Kondo and Asai, 1995), skeletal patterning in vertebrate limbs (Hayes\net al., 1998) and heterocyst spacing in cyanobacterium Anabaena (Yoon and\nGolden, 1998) feature such sequences. Given that regular splitting and insertion\nof peaks is a recurring feature in pattern forming systems in nature it is essential to\nunderstand why mathematical models of such reaction\u2013diffusion systems exhibit\nmode-doubling failure when the growth rate of the domain is too slow. The aim\nof this paper is to address this question in the case of the exponentially growing\ndomain.\nIn Section 2 we present the model system that we will study and illustrate how\nthe standard numerical technique of discretising in space leads to a solution se-\nquence in which mode-doubling breaks down under exponential growth in the do-\nmain with low growth rate. We show that this does not happen if we use a spectral\nmethod to solve the equations. We deduce that it is the erroneous introduction\nof asymmetries from the numerical scheme that causes mode-doubling failure. In\nSection 3 we use the numerical bifurcation package AUTO (Doedel et al., 2001) to\ntrace the bifurcation diagram for the fixed domain case with domain length as the\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 983\nbifurcation parameter. From this, we note that mode-doubling failure appears to\noccur when the solution on the growing domain has to trace an unstable portion of\na solution branch. We examine this in more detail in Section 4 by considering the\nform of the unstable solution at the onset of instability.\nHaving seen that it is the noise in the numerical scheme that drives mode-\ndoubling breakdown, we then consider in Section 5 other forms of noise which\nmay arise in a biological context, namely noise in the parameter values. In\nSection 6 we consider our results in light of the problem of robust pattern selection\nand present conclusions in Section 7.\n2. Pattern sequences on the growing domain\nAs a concrete example we use the Schnakenberg kinetics, which arise from an\napplication of the law of mass action to the trimolecular reaction scheme\nB\nk1\u0001\nk\u22121\nX, (1)\nA\nk2\u2192Y, (2)\n2X+ Y k3\u2192 3X. (3)\nWe chose this model mechanism because of its relative simplicity and because it\nhas been well-studied (Murray, 2003). In this case, the species X acts as the activa-\ntor.\nThe non-dimensionalised kinetics with u(x, t) the concentration of Y and v(x, t)\nthe concentration of X on the one-dimensional domain of length L(t) growing\nexponentially, but rescaled continuously onto the unit interval x \u2208 [0, 1], are\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= 1\nL2\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+ a \u2212 uv2 \u2212 \u03c1u, (4)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= d\nL2\n\u22022v\n\u2202x2\n+ b+ uv2 \u2212 v \u2212 \u03c1v, (5)\ndL\ndt\n= \u03c1L, (6)\nwhere \u03c1 is the domain growth rate (see Crampin et al., 1999 for details). The terms\n\u2212\u03c1u and \u2212\u03c1v describe the dilution effects due to the local expansion of the do-\nmain. In this paper we fix the kinetics parameters a = 0.9 and b = 0.1. We also\ntake the ratio of diffusion coefficients d = 0.06 so that the inhibitor diffuses more\nrapidly than the activator and Turing pattern expression is permitted on the static\nfixed-length domain. Patterns arising in this system are in the form of spike solu-\ntions (Iron et al., 2004), and the activator and inhibitor profiles are out of phase.\nFor the zero-flux boundary conditions to which we restrict our attention the\ncorresponding uniform steady state on the static domain has (u, v) = (0.9, 1). Our\ninitial conditions are small amplitude spatially uncorrelated random perturbations\nfrom this steady state and an initial domain length of L(0) = 1.\n984 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nThis system was studied in detail by Crampin (2000) for the case of exponen-\ntial domain growth. Here, we solve the system numerically using the NAG library\nroutine D03PCF which implements a finite difference method\u2014the method of\nlines\u2014with integration in time using a backward differentiation formula method.\nIn this case we see the canonical mode-doubling sequence through peak splitting.\nIn the mode-doubling sequence the number of peaks (the \u2018pattern mode\u2019) doubles\neach time the domain doubles in length. For this model, such a sequence occurs by\nsplitting of each existing peak at regular intervals, while other models show mode\ndoubling via peak insertion, where new peaks appear in between existing peaks as\nthe length of the domain doubles (Crampin et al., 2002).\nThe first pattern to develop as the domain grows (the first admissible pattern)\nis a half peak which consists of a peak located on either the left- or the right-\nhand boundary. Which of these two pattern polarities occurs depends on the initial\nconditions. However, after the transition from this first pattern mode we see that\nall subsequent pattern modes are of the same polarity (with internal peaks, rather\nthan peaks located on the boundaries). This locking in of polarity is a consequence\nof the peak splitting mechanism (and a sequence of patterns of opposite polarity,\nwith peaks located on the boundaries, is observed for peak insertion).\nThe mode-doubling sequence is characterised by smooth transitions between\nthe quasi-steady patterns. That is, there is a separation of timescales between the\ndynamics of the reaction\u2013diffusion system and the growing domain, the growth\nbeing on the slow timescale and the chemical dynamics on a fast timescale. How-\never, when \u03c1 increases so that the separation of timescales becomes less apparent\nwe see that there is no longer a recognisable sequence of quasi-steady patterns.\nFigure 1b shows such a pattern sequence with \u03c1 = 0.05. The lack of applicability\nof the quasi-steady state assumption in such cases is clear and we can no longer\nassume that the processes of growth and pattern formation are decoupled.\nAt the other extreme of the domain growth rate \u03c1 we consider the case \u03c1 =\n0.0001. Numerical solutions of the system (4)\u2013(6) obtained by discretising the\nsystem on a spatially uniform mesh exhibit the phenomenon of mode-doubling\nfailure shown in Fig. 2. In this case the sequence of patterns is not the same\nFig. 1 Activator concentration profile sequences on the growing domain with large growth rate.\n(a) Mode doubling evident in the quasi-steady pattern sequence with \u03c1 = 0.001. (b) \u03c1 = 0.05 and\nthere is no quasi-steady evolution.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 985\nFig. 2 Mode doubling breaks down at low domain growth rates when (4)\u2013(6) is solved using a\nspatial discretisation explicit method. (a) A typical activator concentration profile for \u03c1 = 0.0001;\n(b) snapshots of the profile showing the asymmetric splitting of the single interior peak which\nforces the failure of mode doubling.\nas before (compared to Fig. 1(a)) and there is not a uniform splitting of peaks\nleading to doubling of the pattern mode each time the domain length doubles.\nThis phenomenon, whereby the mode-doubling sequence is not realised for very\nslow growth rates \u03c1, is what we refer to as mode doubling failure.\nIn this case we do see recognisable quasi-steady patterns, but the transitions\nbetween these are more abrupt. In part this is related to the difference in the\ntimescales of domain growth and pattern formation, but we shall see later that\nthere are further qualitative differences between the two cases of mode-doubling\nfailure and mode-doubling success. Figure 2 illustrates the mechanism by which\npeak splitting fails to generate mode doubling, via asymmetric splitting of a peak.\nThis asymmetric splitting of the single central peak, rather than the symmetric\nsplitting and separation of peaks in Fig. 1(a) suggests that mode-doubling failure is\nrelated to the symmetry of the system and occurs when there is a sufficient degree\nof asymmetry introduced in this splitting process. We investigate this further\nbelow.\nDue to the form of Eqs. (4)\u2013(6), we expect mode-doubling to be the only\nform of behaviour, appealing to the invariance of the system under the mapping\nx \u0005\u2192 1 \u2212 x. The asymmetry that is necessary to lead to a breakdown of mode\ndoubling must therefore be introduced by errors arising during numerical solu-\ntion of the equations, or persist from the initial state. Should that be the case we\nwould wish to understand the nature by which mode-doubling transition may be\nsensitive to these numerical issues. Before we examine this sensitivity, however,\nwe note that, rather than a \u2018critical growth rate\u2019 for a given transition\u2014below\nwhich mode doubling persistently fails, and above which it persistently succeeds\u2014\nwe observe the presence of a critical growth rate window (Fig. 3). For growth\nrates within this window there is a given probability for successful mode doubling\nwhere mode doubling is deemed to have succeeded if the pattern expressed at\ndomain length L= 5 is close to the stable mode 4 pattern. For a given numer-\n986 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nFig. 3 Indicative critical growth rate window for the PDE system (4)\u2013(6) as solved by an explicit\nfinite difference scheme on a uniform spatial mesh. The mode-doubling probability for a given\ngrowth rate is estimated by sampling from 200 realisations with initial conditions (at domain length\nL= 1) randomly selected small perturbations from the homogeneous steady state.\nical method, whether or not mode doubling occurs is determined by the initial\nstate.\nAs an alternative to this basic numerical method we also consider a spectral\nmethod reduction of the PDE system (4)\u2013(6) to a finite ODE system. A natural\nchoice of basis for the system with zero-flux boundary conditions is the Fourier\ncosine series\nU(x, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nUn(t) cos(n\u03c0x) and V(x, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nVn(t) cos(n\u03c0x). (7)\nUsing these series expansions, we can derive from the system (4)\u2013(6) an alterna-\ntive ODE form which preserves the symmetry of the initial state. Without a direct\ntranslation of the initial conditions from the Schnakenberg PDE system to the fi-\nnite ODE system we therefore, consider this ODE form as a distinct system.\nThe truncation to N modes in each of the series U and V, which represent\nthe true solutions u and v, respectively, of Eqs. (4)\u2013(6), gives rise to the ODE\nsystem\ndU0\ndt\n= a \u2212 c0 \u2212 \u03c1U0, (8)\ndV0\ndt\n= b+ c0 \u2212 (1 + \u03c1)V0, (9)\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 987\nand, for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N \u2212 1,\ndUn\ndt\n= \u2212cn \u2212\n(\nn2\u03c02\nL2\n+ \u03c1\n)\nUn, (10)\ndVn\ndt\n= cn \u2212\n(\ndn2\u03c02\nL2\n+ 1 + \u03c1\n)\nVn, (11)\ndL\ndt\n= \u03c1L, (12)\nwhere ci represents the truncated Fourier cosine series reduction of the cubic term\nuv2 in the Schnakenberg kinetics.\nSolving this new system (8)\u2013(12) numerically, again using a backward differ-\nentiation formula method for the time integration, we are able to reproduce the\nphenomenon of mode doubling by symmetric peak splitting. With the truncation\nto N = 40, the steady state patterns expressed (with \u03c1 = 0) in the two systems (4)\u2013\n(6) and (8)\u2013(12) are in close agreement. In addition, however, we find that, under\nthis scheme, mode doubling appears to persist at arbitrarily small domain growth\nrates. This discrepancy reinforces the view that numerical inaccuracy, and the er-\nroneous introduction of anti-symmetric Fourier modes, plays a significant ro\u02c6le in\nmode-doubling failure.\n3. Bifurcation structure for the Schnakenberg kinetics\nWe have established that the influence of numerical errors whilst solving the\nSchnakenberg system (4)\u2013(6) with an explicit finite differences scheme with the\nmethod of lines may be sufficient to drive the system towards a mode-doubling\nfailure state. With an alternative reduction to an ODE system we observe the per-\nsistence of mode doubling at arbitrarily small growth rates. In this section we ex-\namine in depth how the mode-doubling mechanism is susceptible to the influence\nof erroneous Fourier mode growth.\nTo this end, we consider the bifurcation structure of the Schnakenberg system on\nthe static domain, with the domain length L as the primary bifurcation parameter.\nWe generate this structure, with the primary branches shown in Fig. 4, using the\nnumerical bifurcation and continuation package AUTO taking as the solution mea-\nsure the left-hand boundary value of the activator V. In Fig. 4, we also illustrate our\nlabelling scheme for the primary branches which are expressed as large-amplitude\npatterns. The primary branches are labelled by a mode number which denotes\nposition of the branch (in the increasing L direction) on the bifurcation diagram\nand corresponds to the wavenumber of the branch in the linear system; a super-\nscript + or \u2212 which denotes the polarity of the branch: branches labelled by +\nhave left-hand boundary activator concentration greater than that of the uniform\nsteady state; a subscript u or s which denotes instability or stability, respectively,\nof the branch region. Unstable branch regions in Fig. 4 are additionally indicated\nby broken lines, whereas stable regions have solid lines.\n988 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nFig. 4 The bifurcation structure of the system (8)\u2013(11) with the domain length L as primary\nbifurcation parameter and \u03c1 = 0 so that we ignore the dilution terms. For clarity we show only the\nprimary branches; during quasi-steady evolution the secondary branches (which are unstable) are\nnot traced.\nWith slow domain growth, Figs. 1(a) and 2(a) show evidence of quasi-steady\nbehaviour in the activator concentration profile. Both of these pattern sequences\nexhibit the long-term expression of a pattern before the rapid re-organisation\nof this pattern to a further long-expressed pattern, adiabatically following pri-\nmary bifurcation branches. We therefore consider how these quasi-steady state\npatterns, and their re-organisation, tie in to the steady states of the static\ndomain.\nBy visual inspection we can see that the quasi-steady patterns expressed dur-\ning domain growth are close to the steady-state patterns on the static domain. We\nnote that the effects of the dilution terms \u2212\u03c1u and \u2212\u03c1v, as well as the differ-\nences resulting from the different ODE reductions, are small as \u03c1 is small. Fur-\nthermore, we can project the evolving pattern onto the one-dimensional domain\nusing the same solution measure as for the bifurcation structure. In Fig. 5 we see\nhow these two profiles trace the steady-state branches for significant periods of\ntime during domain growth. For this reason, then, we refer to the quasi-steady pat-\nterns that are expressed by the labels of the steady-state branches to which they\nare close.\nWe also see that mode-doubling failure appears to be related to the tracing of\nan unstable branch. In Fig. 5(a), we see that the region 4\u2212u is closely traced by the\ndynamic solution until the branch 4\u2212 becomes stable. In Fig. 5(b), where mode\ndoubling fails, we see that this same branch region is incompletely traced before\ndeparture to the stable branch 3+s .\nIn Section 4 we examine the nature of mode-doubling failure in depth and its\nrelation to this tracing of an unstable branch region. Before then, however, we\nnote that for the solutions of the system (8)\u2013(12), where mode doubling persists\nfor all slow growth rates, tracing of the unstable 4\u2212u is observed.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 989\nFig. 5 Projection of the pattern sequences of Figs. 1(a) and 2(a)\u2014grey trajectories\u2014onto the\nbifurcation diagram of Fig. 4.\n4. Mechanism of mode-doubling failure\nThe steady state of the system for the traced region 4\u2212u on the static domain is a\nsaddle point with a one-dimensional unstable manifold. Failure of mode doubling\nis the departure of the phase point along the unstable manifold away from the\n990 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nFig. 6 The unstable eigenfunction on the branch 4\u2212u corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.0109 for\ndomain length L= 4.62. The profile of the eigenfunction does not change significantly with vari-\nation in L. The solid line details the V-component of the eigenfunction and the broken line the\nU-component.\nbranch 4\u2212u to either of the branches 3\n\u00b1\ns . This mechanism accounts for the occur-\nrence of mode-doubling failure once the growth rate of the domain becomes too\nslow. At slower growth rates the time spent in the presence of the unstable man-\nifold is increased. Consequently there is a tendency for greater movement along\nthe unstable manifold. At some point, in the nonlinear regime, the phase point lies\nwithin the basin of attraction of either of the alternative stable branches. Certainly,\nmode doubling fails if the dynamic solution is not within the basin of attraction of\nthe newly stable 4\u2212s (around L\u2248 4.71).\nMode-doubling failure, then, is an expression of large deviation along an unsta-\nble manifold. The unstable eigenfunction along 4\u2212u (shown for the point L= 4.62 in\nFig. 6) is found to be anti-symmetric. The presence of this anti-symmetric unstable\neigenfunction drives the expression of asymmetric peak splitting as the means of\nmode-doubling failure. Furthermore, the symmetry properties of the two branches\n2\u2212 and 4\u2212 for Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) and (8)\u2013(12) explain why mode doubling is the natural\nbehaviour of the dynamic system. Finally, the occurrence of mode-doubling failure\nin Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) is indeed promoted by the possibility of erroneous Fourier mode\nintroduction by the numerical method.\nIn addition to the existence of a critical growth rate for mode doubling in the\nsystem (4)\u2013(6) as solved using a spatial discretisation method we are in a posi-\ntion to explain the appearance of the critical growth rate window of Fig. 3. Simi-\nlarly to the robustness problem for Turing pattern formation on the static domain,\nthere is sensitivity to the initial conditions for whether mode doubling succeeds\nor fails.\nAt some growth rates the success of mode doubling is sensitive to the initial state\nand the subsequent propagation of numerical error. The growth rate \u03c1 = 0.000136\ncorresponds to a mode-doubling probability close to 0.5 in the critical growth rate\nwindow of Fig. 3. Mode doubling and failure of mode doubling are illustrated in\nFig. 7. These solutions have distinct sets of initial conditions. Both solutions ini-\ntially trace the unstable branch 4\u2212u and both move away along the unstable mani-\nfold. In one case the solution is re-captured by the stable branch 4\u2212s . For the other,\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 991\nhowever, even though the distance from 4\u2212u is not appreciably greater, the phase\npoint is not recaptured by 4\u2212s .\n5. Mode doubling transitions under perturbed kinetics\nThe mode-doubling failure at low growth rates that we observe appears to be due\nto accumulation of small errors. This motivates us to consider the influence of small\nperturbations to the Schnakenberg kinetics. We note that an application of this\ntheory of pattern formation to a biological setting requires us to move away from\nthe idealisation that Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) present. Mode-doubling failure may be presented\nas an erroneous solution of (4)\u2013(6), but it is a valid phenomenon away from the\nidealised state or in a noisy environment.\nThere are many possible ways by which perturbations to the Schnakenberg ki-\nnetics may be introduced. Such perturbations could account for spatio-temporal\nvariation in the rate parameters ki or in the source concentrations [A] and [B].\nFor simplicity, we consider perturbations to the source concentrations which are\nlikely to be much larger than those which arise from a variation in the kinetic rate\nparameters.\nThe effect of this variation is to replace the terms a and b in Eqs. (4), (5), (8)\nand (9) by appropriate spatio-temporally varying terms. Under suitable assump-\ntions about the spatial structure of the perturbations we restrict our attention to\nthe perturbations to the system (8)\u2013(12).\nFig. 7 Unreliable mode doubling for \u03c1 = 0.000136 across the tracing of 4\u2212u . Two initial states\nclose to the homogeneous steady state, such as used for Fig. 3, are chosen: for one state mode\ndoubling fails; for the other mode doubling succeeds by virtue of recapture by 4\u2212s .\n992 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nThe first class of perturbations that we study is that of temporally constant per-\nturbations. In (4), then, we replace a by a + \u03b5a\n\u2211N\u22121\ni=0 ai cos(\u03c0 i x) and similarly for b\nin (5). These changes propagate to (8)\u2013(11) and we introduce the convention that\nthe perturbations are normalised by\n\u2211\na2i + b2i = 1 and set \u03b5a = \u03b5b.\nDuring growth we require for mode doubling to fail that the source of U or V\nbe spatially asymmetric. A simple case, therefore, is to consider the normalised\nperturbation\nai =\n{\n10\n\u221a\n101\n101 i = 1\n0 otherwise\n; bi =\n{\u2212\u221a101\n101 i = 1\n0 otherwise\n, (13)\nwhich has the ratio of U and V components of the perturbation of the same mag-\nnitude as the ratio of the steady state pattern components.\nUnder these perturbed kinetics with \u03b5 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 we see continued applicabil-\nity of the quasi-steady state assumption and tracing of the steady state branches.\nAs for the solutions of the Schnakenberg PDE system with the spatial discretisa-\ntion method we see the possible occurrence of mode-doubling failure. This mode-\ndoubling failure (for \u03c1 < 0.0002) once again follows from movement away from\nthe unstable 4\u2212u towards 3\n\u00b1\ns . Unlike for the previous case, however, the critical\ngrowth rate window arises purely from the influence of the initial conditions, and\nthe window is very narrow.\nWe find the critical growth rate window becomes wider for the perturbed ODE\nform with the introduction of temporally varying perturbations. These perturba-\ntions can take many forms. Motivated by biological systems we consider the cases\nwhere ai and bi vary.\nSpatially correlated perturbations similar to coloured noise can be implemented\nby sampling ai and bi over time from the distributions\nai ,bi \u2208\n[\n\u2212 \u03b5\u02dc\n(i + 1) ,\n\u03b5\u02dc\n(i + 1)\n]\n, (14)\nwith\n\u03b5\u02dc = \u03b5\n(\nN\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n1\ni + 1\n)\u22121\n. (15)\nWith this basic form of spatially correlated perturbation we can determine the\nform of the corresponding critical growth rate windows for each mode-doubling\ntransition. In Fig. 8 we present such windows for the transitions 2\u2212 \u2192 4\u2212, 3\u2212 \u2192 6\u2212\nand 4\u2212 \u2192 8\u2212.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995 993\nFig. 8 Critical growth rate windows for the transitions 2\u2212 \u2192 4\u2212, 3\u2212 \u2192 6\u2212 and 4\u2212 \u2192 8\u2212 of\n(8)\u2013(12) subject to the kinetic perturbation (14). In each, \u00d7 denotes the transition mode-doubling\nprobability, whilst in (c), + represents the probability that mode-doubling failure is by 4\u2212 \u2192 5\u00b1.\n6. Domain growth and the robustness problem\nThe critical growth rate windows of Fig. 8 show that, for a consistent perturbation\ncharacteristic, the growth rate at which mode doubling can be viewed as reliable\nvaries with the transition. This raises the possibility of robust pattern selection\nthrough a pattern sequence involving a failure of mode doubling. Whereas per-\nsistent mode doubling provides for robust selection of pattern modes of the form\n(2n)\u2212 for the appropriate final domain length it is not possible to robustly generate\nfurther pattern modes when the pattern 1\u00b1 is initially expressed.\nWhen mode-doubling failure is included, however, the pattern 6\u2212s is selectable\nfor a range of final domain lengths. A sequence such as 1\u00b1 \u2192 2\u2212 \u2192 3\u00b1 \u2192 6\u2212,\nshould it arise, is precisely this selection. The possibility of robust selection of 6\u2212s\narises with (loose) control of the growth rate of the domain, as indicated by the\ncritical growth rate windows for the final two transitions.\nWe also note that control of the perturbations may further aid both the selection\nof polarity of branch following mode-doubling failure and increase the range of\ngrowth rates suitable for robust selection. A constant pre-pattern, for example, in\naddition to, but of a greater magnitude than, stochastic perturbations may be such\na guide.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have examined mode transition in a reaction\u2013diffusion system\nsolved on an exponentially growing domain. We have shown that the typical long\nterm mode-doubling behaviour breaks down due to noise induced by our numer-\nical scheme. Although, this is an artifact of our solution technique, it is not bio-\nlogically irrelevant, because processes in biology have to operate under constant\nexposure to noise. This motivates us to consider the case of noise in parameter\nvalues and to show that this also contributes to mode-doubling failure.\nApplications of reaction\u2013diffusion theory to biological pattern formation have\nbeen studied in great detail. While its relevance to biology is still controversial,\nit has been shown that Turing structures do arise in chemistry (DeKepper et al.,\n1991; Ouyang and Swinney, 1991). It is still unclear as to whether morphogen pat-\nterns in biology do arise via diffusion-driven instability and whether such a mech-\n994 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 981\u2013995\nanism presents stable patterns. Moreover, it is surprising that little attention has\nbeen paid to the effects of domain growth, given that growth is one of the main\ncharacteristics of development. It was shown by Kondo and Asai (1995) that pig-\nmentation patterns on certain Angelfish followed a transition sequence consistent\nwith that predicted by a Turing type model. This motivated the work of Crampin\net al. (1999), which showed that domain growth could be used to select robustly\ncertain types of patterns.\nIn this paper, we have examined why mode-doubling on an exponentially grow-\ning one-dimensional domain breaks down under very slow growth rate, specifically\nwhen symmetry arguments would suggest otherwise. We have shown that this phe-\nnomenon appears to arise due to noise. At certain transition points, instability of\nthe solution arises due to a saddle point and the solution must trace an unstable\nbranch for some time before it reaches a stable branch. The presence of noise can\nthrow the solution off this branch and we propose this as a mechanism for mode-\ndoubling failure.\nThe results in this paper are for a single point in parameter space for the\nSchnakenberg model. In current work we are examining this in more detail with\napplication to other models, but we note that the behaviour presented here is\nwidespread. In particular, for the Gray\u2013Scott system, which has been widely stud-\nied (Kolokolnikov et al., 2005) in many of its behavioural regimes, we see mode\ndoubling with the possibility of failure when the pattern sequence is driven by do-\nmain growth.\nAcknowledgements\nIB acknowledges the EPSRC for a graduate studentship.
