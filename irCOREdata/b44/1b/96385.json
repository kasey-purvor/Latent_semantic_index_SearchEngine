More precisely, it is seen as a \ntrustworthy mechanism of producing elections results that accurately represent the \nchoices of the electorate. In this paper we discuss briefly the concepts of trust and \ntrustworthiness and focus to examine the formation of beliefs regarding the latter. We \nargue that the belief of trustworthiness is only partly attributable to the perception of \nthe merits of the technical system and its enactment procedures. Significant role in the \nformation of this belief in the case of the Brazilian electronic elections has played the \nthe reputation of the institutional actors responsible for the elections \u2013 the Superior \nand the Regional Electoral Courts. We therefore conclude that, unlike common \nassumptions about the potential of e-government in developing countries to restore \ntrust in government institutions which are considered untrustworthy, the production of \ntrust in ICT-mediated government services relies on citizens\u2019 perceptions of their \ntrustworthiness. \n \n Keywords: electronic voting, institutional trust, trustworthiness, Brazil, developing \ncountries, e-government. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the organizations that made our research possible either by \nfunding our empirical study, or by providing valuable data. These include the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank, which funded a first cycle of our research in 2004, the \nTSE in Bras\u00edlia, the TREs in Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre. From the numerous \nindividuals who helped us to conduct this research we are indebted in particular to  \nMarie Anne Macadar, Amarolinda Saccol, and Isabel de Meiroz Dias. \n 1\nInterpreting the trustworthiness of ICT-mediated government: \nlessons from electronic voting in Brazil \n \nIntroduction \nThe research we present in this paper has been triggered by the concerns of  \ninternational development agencies about the Latin American citizens\u2019 low degree of \ntrust in democratic government institutions, as indicated by various opinion surveys \n(Latinobar\u00f3metro, 2004; UNDP, 2004). In current development thinking, economic \ngrowth requires \u2018good government\u2019, which comprises transparency in decision \nmaking, efficient administration, effective accounting, a reliable legal system, social \ncohesion, avoidance of corruption, state capability and credibility (Meier, 2001). Lack \nof citizens\u2019 confidence in democratic institutions is a worrying sign of lack of \npropensity to cooperate, and therefore an obstacle to economic growth. Against the \nbackground of such concerns, e-government programmes are generally expected to \nimprove citizens\u2019 access to government services, to bring transparency of \ngovernments\u2019 decisions and activities, and to combat corruption in state \nadministration, thus to restore citizens\u2019 trust of government.  \nThe opportunity for our research arose from the Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s \n(IADB) interest in determining the potential of its sponsored e-government projects in \nthe Latin American region to impact on citizens\u2019 trust in their governments. One of \nthe ICT applications we chose to study is electronic voting in Brazil. A study of the \nuse of ICT to support the conduct of elections is particularly pertinent to the question \nof citizens\u2019 trust in democratic government because it concerns one of the most \nfundamental institutions of democracy and is used by all citizens above the age of 18i.  \nIn our empirical research we found a great deal of evidence that Brazil\u2019s electronic \nvoting system is widely used and appreciated, and that the election results it produces \nare, with few exceptions, accepted to be the correct aggregate of individual citizens\u2019 \nactual votes. Yet, the formation of plausible cause and effect relationships between a \ntechnical\/institutional arrangement and trust, as expressed in citizens\u2019 opinion surveys \nand demonstrated by their actions, posed a theoretical challenge. Our review of \nexisting literature on trust did not suggest a satisfactory theoretical basis for such a \ncausal relationship. Most of the vast literature on trust concerns interpersonal \nrelationships and is not directly relevant for our study which is concerned with trust in \npolitical institutions, such as the various agencies that deliver the services of the \nmodern state. Trust in government is distinct from trust in particular individuals \noccupying positions in government and administration. Taking an interpretivist \nstance, we framed our study as an investigation of citizens\u2019 belief that government \nagencies are trustworthy and sought to examine how a technology mediated \ngovernment service, such as electronic voting, is implicated in this belief. \nThe paper is structured as follows. In the next section we introduce the concepts \npertaining to the question of trust in this research and identify distinctions and \nrelationships that guide the data collection and analysis of our empirical study. We \nthen describe our research in terms of data collection method and process of analysis. \nIn the following section we describe the electronic voting system, its government and \nbroader social context, and its role in the election process and its results. In the \ndiscussion section that follows we unravel the way this technology innovation is seen \nto be associated with changes in the Brazilian citizens\u2019 perception of trustworthiness \nin elections and in democratic government at large. Finally, in the conclusions we \n 2\ndraw some answers to the question whether and under what conditions e-government \ncan be a mechanism for restoring citizens\u2019 trust in government institutions. \n \nDisentangling concepts \nA large and dispersed literature has highlighted the significance of trust in modern \nsociety. Indicatively, in economics and politics trust is a necessary condition for the \nfunctioning of the market and the political system (Williamson, 1975; Fukuyama, \n1995; Putnam, 2000); in sociology and organizational theory trust is often juxtaposed \nto control mechanisms of social systems (Luhmann, 1979; Gambetta, 1988; Giddens, \n1991). Giddens pointed out the significance of actively creating trust in the expert \nsystems that make the fabric of late modernity (Giddens, 1990; Giddens, 1994). In IS, \na stream of publications have reported research on trust as it pertains to new forms of \nbusiness enabled by the internet, such as virtual teams, and e-commerce and e-\ngovernment (Jarvenpaa & Leidner, 1999; Ba & Pavlou, 2002; Piccoli & Ives, 2003; \nJarvenpaa et al., 2004).  \nThis literature tends to argue for the significance of individuals\u2019 attitude of trust \ntowards others as well as towards institutions of their societies. But beyond the \ngeneral thesis on the importance of trust in modern societyii, the nature of \u2018trust\u2019 and \nthe conditions that foster it remain opaque and controversial. One area of contention, \nfor example, is the extent to which trust in government institutions depends on \ninterpersonal trust (Levi, 1998; Putnam, 2000). Some political theorists argue that the \ntrust individuals form through their lives towards strangers and collectives of \nstrangers in their communities plays an important role in developing trust in the \nimpersonal political institutions of modern democratic societies (Hardin, 1998). \nOthers reverse the causality between interpersonal and political trust. They argue that \nface-to-face, community based, relations play a limited role in building trust in the \ninstitutions of complex societies. Instead, they emphasize the importance of legal and \ninstitutional mechanisms, such as the courts of justice, elections, property rights, for \nfostering trust in other members of a society (Zucker, 1986; Fukuyama, 1995; Cohen, \n1999; Levi & Stoker, 2000). \nThe literature of trust that focuses more specifically on government helped us begin to \nunpack the common sense view association of ICT-related improvements in \ngovernment organizations with increasing citizens\u2019 trust in government, and to frame \nconceptually our research question. In particular, we drew from Hardin\u2019s analysis on \ntrust and trustworthiness of government (Hardin, 1998; Hardin, 2002).  Hardin \nexplains why the general definition of trust that he adopted throughout his studies of \ninterpersonal relationships (trust as \u2018encapsulated interest\u2019iii) is not appropriate for \nstudying trust in government. In a nutshell, this is mainly because citizens cannot \npossibly know the interests, incentives, and actions of the individual role holders of \ngovernment institutions. At best, he suggests, citizens can form \u2018quasi trust\u2019, \n\u2018grounded in inductive expectations from past behavior or reputation\u2019 about the \ntrustworthiness of government (Hardin, 2002).  \nHardin\u2019s analysis (2002) indicates the conceptual and epistemological difficulties in \ngrasping the meaning and mechanisms of \u2018trust in government\u2019. Also, it points our \nattention to the study of \u2018reasons for believing government agents to be trustworthy\u2019 \nas an alternative more feasible strategy for beginning to understand how a technology \nintervention in a government institution may affect citizens\u2019 attitude to government. \n 3\nThe distinction between trust and trustworthiness is important for our study of why \nand how ICT may strengthen citizens\u2019 trust in government. It provides a conceptual \nbasis for associating people\u2019s perception of a system, a government service, or an \ninstitution with their behavioural attitude as citizens.  \nTrustworthiness vs trust \nThe concept of trustworthiness refers to the properties through which a trusted entity \n(whether another person or an institution) serves the interests of the truster, while trust \nreflects the truster\u2019s beliefs, or perceptions, of the entity\u2019s trustworthiness (Levi & \nStoker, 2000). The relationship between trustworthiness and trust has received a great \ndeal of attention in studies of trust in advanced democracies where surveys show \nwidespread suspicion to the performance of almost all established institutions, such as \nschools and health care systems. One of the paradoxes in that context is that measures \ndesigned to monitor and demonstrate trustworthiness, such as performance indicators, \ntend to accentuate the problem of low trust, perpetuating a climate of suspicion \n(O'Neill, 2002). That is, even when performance indicators suggest improvements of \nservices, citizens continue to place low trust in the institutions delivering them. \nTwo main reasons are discernible in the literature for the mismatch between \ninterventions intended to improve the trustworthiness a government service and trust \nthe service enjoys as a result (Levi & Stoker, 2000; O'Neill, 2002). First, the \nwillingness of citizens to rely on a service depends on their judgment of the overall \nsocial and political context that sustains them and is shaped on the basis of more \ngeneral beliefs and political predispositions. Second, the perception of trustworthiness \nrelies on the cognitive and emotional capacity that individual citizens bring to bear on \ntheir experience of a service, on indicators used to describe aspects of trustworthiness, \nor on informants, such as the media. All of these may misinterpret or misrepresent the \nresulting service, either towards misplaced trust, or towards excessive suspicion. \nTherefore, while it is reasonable to expect that an agency\u2019s intentional efforts for the \ndevelopment of trustworthy e-government services potentially contributes to citizens\u2019 \ntrust in the agency, it does not determine it. Citizens\u2019 perception of the trustworthiness \nof a government agency is mitigated by their expectations and beliefs about its \npolitical underpinning and, as Hardin explains (2002), by the limited knowledge \ncitizens have of the agency actions. For example, citizens\u2019 view of the fairness of the \npolicy legislation that a government agency enacts may contribute to a general \nattitude of suspicion towards it, which conditions the way they perceive the services \nput in place to support their interaction with the agency.  \nWith this conceptual distinction between trust and trustworthiness in mind, in this \npaper we focus on exploring perceptions and interpretations of the trustworthiness of \ne-voting in Brazil. At the conclusions we discuss the limitations of this choice of \nfocus to account for the formation of trust. \nTrustworthiness of ICT, ICT-mediated services, and government agencies \nWe need also to disentangle the entities we study as the object of citizens\u2019 \ntrustworthiness judgment in the electronic voting case. Several systems are potentially \nimplicated in such a judgment: specific ICT artifacts, the electronic voting system, the \ngovernment institution that oversees the elections, the regime of democratic \ngovernment at large. The central concern of our analysis in this paper is the middle \nground of the particular ICT-mediated government service of the conduct of \nelectronic elections. We consider Brazils\u2019 e-voting system as a particular \u2018service\u2019 \n 4\nthat comprises the enactment of a set of particular technologies and constitutes part of \nthe overall responsibilities of country\u2019s electoral agencies iv. Of interest therefore to \nus is the way citizens\u2019 perception of trustworthiness of a government service \n(elections) is influenced by the perception of an ICT system (electronic voting \nsystem) as a trustworthy interface to the government agency (the electoral agency), or \na trustworthy actor involved in the performance of the agency\u2019s task.  \nIn the information systems literature it is recognized that, even if successfully \nimplemented, the technology of e-government may not be considered adequately \ntrustworthy to be used and therefore its adoption is itself in need of trust-building \nmechanisms (Warkentin et al., 2002; Carter & B\u00e9langer, 2005). Based mainly on the \ntechnology acceptance model (TAM), the literature has suggested that, in order to be \nadopted, e-commerce and e-government technologies must be perceived to be useful \nand easy to use. In addition, the IS literature  on trust has emphasized the importance \nof the technology-based transactions being perceived as secure (Gefen et al., 2003; \nCarter & B\u00e9langer, 2005; Salam et al., 2005). The usefulness of e-government \nservices is usually associated with specific performance improvements, such as \nefficiency and effectiveness in delivering a range of services, reduction of corruption, \nor transparency in the conduct of administration.  The issue of security is understood \nto point to the need for institutional mechanisms that safeguard integrity of \ntransactions, such as certification and escrows (McKnight et al., 2002; Warkentin, \nGefen et al., 2002; Pavlou & Gefen, 2004).  \nSuch TAM-based explanations take too narrow a perspective of a user-artifact \nrelationship and cannot account either for the origin of the user perceptions or for \ntheir resulting interpretations of these perceptions into beliefs of trustworthiness of the \ntechnology-mediated service and the agency that provides it. A recent critique of \nTAM as non-falsifiable indicates its analytical limitations (Silva, 2007). The study of \nthe way ICT-mediated services, such as electronic elections, are implicated in the \nformation of beliefs regarding the trustworthiness of government agencies needs to \nsearch further than TAM. First, it needs to examine the question why people may or \nmay not perceive the ICT-mediated service as useful, or may not find it easy to use, \nand therefore what other conditions may influence the views on the trustworthiness of \nan electronic service. Second, it needs to examine whether beliefs of trustworthiness \nof an electronic service, may or may not be translated into beliefs about the \ntrustworthiness of the government agency that enacts the ICT-mediated service.  \nOne answer regarding the former that emerged from our empirical study of the \nelectronic voting system an Brazil and seems to be validated by other research is \npeople\u2019s predisposition to ICT. The perception of ICT-mediated transaction system as \nuseful, easy, and secure, is related with users\u2019 familiarity and existing views about \nICT in general. This was demonstrated in a study of the implementation of a GIS \nsystem in India by Barrett et al (Barrett et al., 2001). Such a predisposition is formed \nfrom prior experience of citizens with ICT, as well as from a shared community view \nof the practical and symbolic significance of ICT, which is generally captured in the \nterm \u2018ICT culture\u2019 (Leidner & Kayworth, 2006).  \nThere is less research regarding the latter issue of the possible mismatch between \npeople\u2019s belief that an ICT-mediated service is trustworthy and their view on the \ntrustworthiness of the government agency that provides the service. We came across \nan example of this mismatch in our study of the electronic tax system in Brazil. The \nsystem was widely used and highly appreciated by the middle class tax payers as easy \n 5\nto use, useful, and generally trustworthy. Yet, our interviewees\u2019 overall view of the \ntax authorities was rather negative, tainted by their perception of the taxation \nlegislation as unfair to them.  \nResearch Process \nWe identified the electronic voting system of Brazil as suitable for studying the ICT \nand trust-in-government relationship through its reputation as a case of successful use \nof ICT in the government sector. Brazilian elections is an exceptionally trouble free \nactivity within the country\u2019s political system of parliamentary democracy. Amidst a \nclimate of continuous allegations of corruptions on virtually all aspects of the conduct \nof government, elections have been conducted without loud complaints of fraud since \nthe restoration of democracy in the late 1980s. Also, the Brazilian trouble free \nelections stand out in comparison to elections in other Latin American countries, such \nas Mexico, where the legitimacy of elections results are often disputed creating \npolitical instability. \nWe conducted an interpretive empirical study that aimed to trace the construction of \nthe electronic voting system; to produce a description of the materiality and \nfunctionality of the artifacts involved as well as the organizational, social and political \ndimensions of its context; to produce a description of the process of elections; and to \nidentify perceptions and beliefs about the trustworthiness of the technology systems, \nthe electronic elections service, and the elections as an institution of democratic \ngovernment. Central in this research effort has been our fieldwork during two \noccasions of Brazilian elections: the second round of the municipal elections in the \ncity of Sao Paulo on 31 October 2004, and the first round of the general elections of \n2006, on 1st October, for President, Senate, Federal Congress and States Government \noffices.  \nSpecifically, our data collection focused on the following:  \na) The technology artifacts that comprise the e-voting system and their functionality \nand the processes through which the system was initially engineered and is updated in \nbetween elections. We collected such data through interviews and system \ndemonstrations in the organizations responsible for these technical tasks at the Federal \nlevel of government - the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) in Bras\u00edlia - and two state \ngovernments  - the Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais (TREs) of the state of Sao Paulo \nand the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Porto Alegre. In all we had 7 sessions during \nwhich teams of systems analysts and project managers presented to us descriptions of \nthe technologies and the story of systems development, answered our questions, and \nprovided us with relevant descriptive documents.  \nb) The institutional context of the elections. We sought to form an in depth \nunderstanding of the Brazilian government system and the institutions responsible for \nFederal and State elections (the TSE and TREs) with a variety of formal and informal \nresearch methods. These included encyclopedic sources and specialist publications on \nBrazilian government and politics, interviews with 9 Judges and support staff at the \nTSE and two TREs we visited in 2004 and 2006, interviews with 4 political scientists \nin the Universities of Sao Paulo and Bras\u00edlia.  \nc) The process of the elections. We collected descriptive information on the way the \nprocess of updating, certifying the validity, distributing, installing, and using the \nelectronic system is intertwined with the legal\/organizational process of preparing and \nconducting the elections. Furthermore, we observed two episodes of elections. During \n 6\nthe 2004 elections we were part of a group of visitors at the Tribunal Regional \nEleitoral (TRE) of the state of Sao Paulo and observed the \u2018system in action\u2019 in two \nvoting stations. During the 2006 elections two of the authors were part of a group of \nforeign visitors at the TRE of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Porto Alegrev and \nobserved the installation and preparation of the system in a voting station, the voting \nprocess in three voting stations, the \u2018parallel run\u2019 testing of the system, the closing of \nthe ballot, the collection of results in a regional results collection centre, and the \nunfolding of the announcement of election results at the TRE. \nd) Views and feelings about the e-voting system, the conduct of elections, and the \nconduct of politics in Brazil. During our visits to the voting stations we interviewed \nmore than 20 voters. Also, we interviewed one journalist, 5 activists campaigning \nagainst the system on the basis that it is insecure, and staff of three NGOs, namely, \nTransparency International in Sao Paulo, INESC in Bras\u00edlia, a Jesuit mission in a \nfavela of Porto Alegre.  \nOur analysis followed a gradual process of research question and argument \nrefinement through the formation of a succession of general conjectures regarding \nICT and citizens\u2019 trust and case-specific analyses. The first cycle of our empirical \nstudy, during the 2004 elections, started with a broad sensitization from the general \nmulti-disciplinary literature about trust. From our observations and accounts given by \nour interviewees we constructed descriptions of the system and the conditions of \npossibility for its development and use. From that first study we became aware of \ntechnology security concerns voiced by computer engineers and some political \nscientists and we noticed that, despite such voices, voters and the political parties did \nnot show signs of doubting the trustworthiness of the election process. Two other \nobservations emerged from our data collection: first, that the trustworthiness of the \nelectronic elections was a continuous concern for the TSE and TREs and was actively \ncultivated by them in the period between elections as well as at the time of elections, \nand second that the beliefs in the trustworthiness of the electronic voting system were \nsupported by a general positive attitude towards ICT among citizens. We therefore \nformed the conjecture that the citizens belief of trustworthiness of the Brazilian ICT-\nmediated elections implicates three analytically distinguishable elements: the citizens \nperception of trustworthiness of the electronic voting system; their perception of \ntrustworthiness of the election authorities; and their positive predisposition towards \nICT. Consequently the second round of our theory review and empirical research \nfocused on confirming the validity of this conjecture and exploring relationship of \nthese three elements. \nElectronic voting in Brazil \nThe institutional context \nBrazil is a presidential and federative republic composed of twenty-six states and the \nFederal District (Bras\u00edlia). The authority responsible for the conduct of electoral affairs \nis the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE). TSE has jurisdiction over all aspects of \nelections and regulates the functioning of political parties. The electoral law in Brazil is \nrevised every two years, in correspondence with a new turn of elections. It is the TSE\u2019s \nresponsibility to draft a law resolution to submit to the legislative power for approval. \nThe TSE, over the years, has developed a high reputation for trustworthiness, \ncompetence, and autonomy in the management of the electoral process. Therefore, the \ncontent of this draft is rarely debated by the legislative.  \n 7\nThe management of the elections process is delegated to the Regional Electoral Courts \n(TRE \u2013 Tribunal Regional Eleitoral). Each Court is formed of three judges, who belong \nto the State Court of Justice. Each State is divided into Electoral Zones, and the total \nnumber of electoral zones in the country is 2,900.  \nThe development of the e-voting system \nAt the beginning of 1995, the TSE formed a task force comprising staff from the TSE \nand the TREs and financed by the World Bank. The objectives of the task force were to \nstop fraud and to strengthen political participation and inclusion by simplifying the \nvoting system. The existing system required people to read the names of candidates \nfrom a list and to write down their names on the ballot paper, but the level of illiteracy \nin Brazil was very high, close to 30% of the population. Therefore, they perceived a \npressing need not only to improve the user-friendliness of the interface (the ballot \npaper), but also the knowledge-base required to participate to the process.  \nAfter six months the task force produced a proposal for the development of a \ncomputerized ballot box and invited technical experts from Federal ministries to \nparticipate in defining the system\u2019s technical requirements and specifications. At the \nbeginning of September 1995, a team of fourteen technical specialists started working \non the system\u2019s development and in May 1996 the first copy of the electronic voting \nmachine was released. The machine was tested for the first time in the Municipal \nelections of October, 1996. The test included all cities with more than 200,000 voters \nand all state capitals, which involved 33% of the voters. A second test was run for the \ngeneral election of 1998. This test included all cities with more than 40,000 voters, \nreaching 67% of the voters. Finally, the system was used in the whole country for the \nmunicipal elections of 2000.  \nElections preparation \nThe preparation process starts in December of the year before the elections when the \nTSE submits to the parliament a draft resolution to update the electoral law. The \ndocument does not include technical descriptions of the e-voting system; it reflects the \nchanges needed to enact the law into a new version of the system. The resolution \nproposed has to be approved by the parliament in March. The TSE, at this point, has \none month to review the system according to the requirements specified in the \napproved resolution.  \n180 days before elections the software development stops and the new source code is \nmade available to the technical experts of political parties to detect whether the system \ncomplies with the law approved. Sixty days before the elections the software is sealed \nduring a public ceremony. Political parties\u2019 and civil societies\u2019 representatives are \ninvited to participate in order to digitally sign the compiled copy of the software code. \nDuring this ceremony a sequence of major events take place. The first is the generation \nof hash function tables. The second is the digitally signing of the compiled version of \nthe software source code. Finally, the software applications, digitally signed and \nencrypted, are distributed to the TREs. \nA few days before the elections each TRE loads all e-voting machines with the \ncandidate (name, number, party or coalition abbreviation and photo) and voters tables \nand the software applications. Political parties\u2019 representatives are required to attend \nthis loading process. The validation of the loading process is made on a sample of three \nper cent of the overall population of e-voting machines randomly selected by Parties\u2019 \nrepresentatives. \n 8\nThe day before the elections e-voting machines are put in place. This is a massive \noperation. In the 2006 general elections 380,945 voting machine were placed in that \nmany voting stations, distributed in 91,244 voting locations, for the voting service of \n125,913,479 registered voters.  \nA percentage of these machines, depending on the number of voters in each State, are \ntaken back to TRE for a simulation of a voting session that consists of two ballot boxes: \nthe electronic voting system, and the traditional ballot box. A sample of randomly \ncollected votes is cast in both systems and the results are compared for consistency.  \nAt 7.30 a.m. on the election day, the president of the precinct turns on the e-voting \nmachine at the presence of voting board\u2019s representatives and political parties\u2019 ones. \nThe e-voting machine prints out automatically a report, called \u201czeresima\u201d, which \ncertifies that the ballot box is empty, i.e. that there is no candidate with a pre-assigned \nnumber of votes. \nFunctional description of the e-voting system \nThe voting machine consists of two terminals installed in each polling station. The first \nis the voting board representatives\u2019 terminal and has a numerical keyboard with a two \nlines liquid crystal screen. It is used by the board representative to type a voter\u2019s \nidentification number. If he or she is registered in the precinct, his or her name is \ndisplayed on the screen and the identification is accomplished. The board \nrepresentative checks on the screen the status of the voting machine and, if available, \npresses \u2018enter\u2019 to turn the machine on the ready state. \nThe second terminal is the voters\u2019 one. When the voter enters the booth, the machine \nshould be on the ready state. The voter terminal is also formed of a keyboard and a \nliquid crystal display. The voter expresses his\/her preference by typing their candidate \nidentification number. The screen shows the candidate\u2019s name, initials of the party or \ncoalition he or she belongs to and his or her photo, and if these are correct, voters press \nenter to confirm. The keyboard has two additional keys: the first is the correction key \nthat allows voters to re-start the process, the second is the blank vote key. \n***please insert the photo of the machine about here*** \nAt 5 p.m. of the election days the president of the precinct uses his or her password to \nclose the voting machine and to print a voting machine report for the precinct. This \nreport contains the following information: precinct\u2019s identification code; voting \nmachine\u2019s identification code; number of voters who attended and voted; total voting \nresults for each candidate. \nThe report is printed in five copies. These five copies are signed by the president of the \nprecinct and by the representatives and inspectors of the political parties. One copy is \ndisplayed announcing the results of the precinct. Three copies are enclosed to the \nprecincts register and sent to the electoral committee. The last copy is delivered to the \npolitical parties committee. If required, the machine can print out five additional copies \nthat can be distributed to the district attorney of the political parties, to representatives \nof the press and to the public prosecution office. The copy that is delivered to the \npolitical parties committee is extremely important, because it allows parties to check \nwhether the data have been modified during transmission. Upon data reception, the \nTRE and the TSE send an electronic receipt to political parties. \nThe voting machine program saves the data on a diskette in an encrypted format to \nprevent data modification and the diskette is delivered to the local electoral committee. \n 9\nData are then decrypted and uploaded with a \u201cguiding program\u201d. The process, at this \npoint, varies according to the type of election. In the case of municipal elections the \ndata is totally-added at the precinct of the municipality and then transferred to the local \nTRE and to the TSE. In the case of general election the data are read at the precinct that \ncorresponds to the municipality and transmitted to the local TRE and to TSE. The data \non votes for the President of the Republic are added up and announced by the TSE.  \nThe technical trustworthiness of the entire system is ensured by a security infrastructure \naiming at preventing data from being intentionally or unintentionally modified and\/or \ndeleted. The security of the system comprises the system audit program, which records \nall transactions performed on the particular machine, and the system security program, \nwhich prevents any tampering with the voting machine, such as the removal of the \ndiskette on which election votes are stored.   \n  \nDiscussion \nPerceptions of trustworthiness of the electronic voting system \nThe electronic voting system of Brazil has several qualities that make it, and \nconsequently the elections, perceived to be trustworthy. It is indeed generally seen as \neasy to use, thus satisfying a basic criterion of user acceptance suggested in the IS \nliterature on trust. The voting machine has a very simple interface, comprising an \nunambiguous presentation of voting options, confirmation and cancellation procedures, \npictures of candidates and Braille coding on the buttons to secure universal access \nincluding illiterate and blind people.  \nIn addition, it is appreciated by different stakeholders for various efficiency effects. \nRepresentatives of political parties, political scientists, and NGOs valued the system for \nallowing illiterate people to vote and for reducing the percentage of spoilt votes due to \nunreadable handwriting. Voting is compulsory in Brazil, and therefore the number of \npeople voting is not a good indication of their views of the trustworthiness of the \nelections, or the value of the elections as a democratic institution. However, there has, \nat various periods in the past, been a large proportion of invalid votes. In the 1990 and \n1994 elections (i.e. before the electronic voting system) the rate of invalid votesvi \nexceeded 40% of the ballots cast.  In 1998 the invalid votes fell by half, and in 2002 - \nwhen the system as used in the whole country - they fell again to 7.6% of the total \nnumber of votes cast. Political analysts attribute the reduction of invalid votes partly to \nthe introduction of the electronic voting system and explain it as a matter of simplifying \nthe previous too complex manual system of voting and counting of votesvii (Limongi, \n2006)viii.  \nVoters seems to appreciate the problem-free experience of voting. The fast and un-\ncrowded voting experience created a relaxed and almost celebratory atmosphere at the \nvoting stations we visited. Many parents took their young children with them to the \nvoting booth to show them how they used the machine. The judges we interviewed \npointed out that the do not now spend time at voting stations overseeing the voting; \ninstead they concentrate their attention to other potential types of electoral fraud, such \nas political parties influencing the voting choices at the vicinity of the voting stations. \nMoreover, many interviewees noted that the counting of votes takes considerably less \ntime than it used to do in the manual voting system and the speed in announcement of \nthe election results increased dramatically. Indicatively, in the 2004 municipal elections \n 10\n99% of the votes (more than 100 million votes) were counted within five hours from \nthe closing of the voting stations.  \nOverall, opinion surveys and behaviour indicators tend to confirm that the election \nprocess is widely believed to be trustworthy. A survey conducted by non-governmental \nagenciesix in 2004 showed that 81.5% of the respondents have full or partial confidence \nin the Electoral Justice institution, with 89.5% of them judging positively the services it \nprovides, and 96.7% judging positively the speed of the counting of votes. Moreover \nwe found no disputes over results, even in cases that the votes gained by competing \ncandidates were very close. There were no incidents of challenging the validity of the \nvote counts such as those in the much publicised cases of electronic voting in USA \nstates. \nPositive predisposition towards ICT \nThe perception of trustworthiness enjoyed by the electronic voting system was \ncompatible with, and we believe was enabled by, a general positive attitude towards \nICT in Brazil. The view that ICT is a modernizing and facilitating means for \ngovernment and the economy is widespread amidst the middle income population of \nBrazil. The country made an early start in the use and production of IT and pursued \nsustained computerization efforts despite its frequent crises of economic and political \ninstability (Tigre, 2003). Government computerization (and more recently e-\ngovernment) tapped onto and further contributed to the development of local ICT \nexpertisex. Advanced ICT use in the banks at the period of hyperinflation of the 1980s \nfamiliarized citizens with ICT as a trusted facilitator of services. Today Brazilians \nmake extensive use of electronic payment systems and e-commerce increases rapidly xi. \nThey came to expect similar convenience from their transactions with the government \nsector.  \nThere have been also many efforts by Federal, State, and Municipal governments, as \nwell as by NGOs to provide access to ICT in poor communities throughout the country, \nspreading the message that ICT is sine qua non for inclusion in the modern economy. \nToday there are layers of IT infrastructure in most of the Federal and State government \nagencies, providing electronic transactions with business and banks, and an increasing \nrange of internet transactions with citizens. And through the electronic elections, ICT \nfurther gained in popularity as means that modernize the state and boost the economy, \nused by all, rich and poor, and facilitating a democratic institution.  \nIn short, the general familiarity of citizens with ICT and their positive predisposition \ntowards its use from prior experience with the electronic services of powerful and \nsuccessful institutions, such as banks, seems to have facilitated by analogy the belief \nthat the electronic elections are trustworthy. This is an important observation because \nBrazil is rather exceptional among developing countries for its extensive capabilities to \nconstruct and use ICT.  In countries where citizens have either little or negative \nexperience with ICT use, ICT-mediated government services may not be easily \nperceived as trustworthy. \nPerception of trustworthiness of the election authorities \n \nOur study suggests that the perception of trustworthiness of the electronic voting \nsystem is reciprocal with the perception of trustworthiness of the TSE and the TREs. \nAs the voting part of the elections process is generally believed to be trustworthy, the \noverall perception of trustworthiness of the electoral authorities is increased xii. At the \n 11\nsame time, the perception of the trustworthiness of the voting system relies on the \nperception of the TSE as a trustworthy guarantor of the election process. This became \nclear to us with the controversy over the system\u2019s security.  \nThe security of the system is a contentious issue. The system makes extensive use of \ndigital authentication mechanisms and encryption techniques (for the software loaded \non the machines as well as the votes cast) as well as physical security measures, such as \nthe paper sealing and signing of the disk and flash card entrance slots of the machines. \nThere is also a range of possibilities provided by the TSE for auditing of the system. \nYet, some computer scientists, political scientists, journalists, legal experts, and a small \npolitical party have voiced concernsxiii. Central among their criticism of the system \nsecurity is the lack of a paper log of votes. The TSE has recently amended the system \nto record individual votes (in random order in order to maintain anonymity of voting) \nbut still the totally electronic form of the votes precludes resorting to the counting of \nvotes recorded on paper in case there is a dispute. There are also concerns about \ninadequacy of the auditing allowed prior to the elections. Complains include the limited \nparts of source code available to political parties for inspection (the commercial \noperating systems of some of the machines is a particular cause of concern) and the \nlack of testing of the systems performance by political parties representatives and other \ninterested individuals. Moreover, the current identification of voters at the voting \nstation is considered unsatisfactory.  \nThis last point is the only concern the TSE acknowledges as valid and is now \nconsidering the implementation of electronic means of voters\u2019 identification, such as \nchecking of fingerprints. The TSE considers the printing of votes to be a source of \ninefficiency and, potentially, of fraud xiv. Also, they argue that the current limitations of \nauditing are necessary precautions against external interference with the system. For \nexample, allowing hands-on testing of the system may open possibilities of altering the \nsoftware code before the digital sealing.  \nIn effect, the security of the electronic voting system is considered robust in terms of \npreventing external fraud \u2013 though not un-breachable - but relies heavily on the \nguardian authorities, the TSE and the TREs. Indicatively, in addressing requests for \nstrengthening the technical and auditing means for the security of the system, the TSE \nreplied \u2018the guarantee of the security of the electronic elections is us\u2019xv. The TSE is a \ncompetent and powerful actor in the political system of the country. It is actively \ncultivating perceptions of trustworthiness in the election system by demonstrating the \nelectronic system through television and school education, and creating publicity about \nthe preparation of the electronic elections. \nIn short, there is a mutual reinforcement of the perception of trustworthiness of the \nelectronic system and its hosting government agency. While the electronic voting \nsystem is contributing to the perception of Brazilian elections as an efficient and fair \nexercise of a democratic right, it relies on expectations of the competent overseeing by \nthe TSE. The system is believed to be trustworthy to the extent that the TSE is believed \nnot to abuse its power. The TSE, already very powerful in the Brazilian politics xvi, has \nboosted its legitimacy by modernizing elections through a domestically made \ntrustworthy technology that is highly praised internationally and is now transferred to \nother countries. At the same time, its own trustworthiness is a necessary element for \nfraud-free use of the electronic system.  \n \n 12\nConclusions \nWe can now examine how far our study has gone towards providing an answer to the \nquestion regarding the possibility of e-government to restore citizens\u2019 trust in \ndemocratic government that triggered our research. Clearly, the framing of our study as \nan exploration of citizens\u2019 beliefs in the trustworthiness of the electronic voting service \nand the government agency responsible for the elections has a limited capacity to \nanswer the initial broad question on the relationship between the implementation of \nICT-mediated-services and trust-in-government. First, our focus on beliefs about \ntrustworthiness considered a more narrow aspect than trust. Belief in trustworthiness is \na cognitive concept, which cannot capture accurately citizens\u2019 feelings and behavioural \nattitude towards democratic government. A study of trust will have to go beyond the \ntracing of perceptions and beliefs and to investigate citizens\u2019 political actions.  \nSecond, with our focus on the electronic voting service in relation to the electoral \nagency that hosts it we have not been able to examine whether and how belief of \ntrustworthiness of the services of an agency scale up to belief of trustworthiness of \ndemocratic government. We have found some indication for caution about the \nassumption of possibility of such scaling up. Simply put, the perception whether \nelections are trustworthy may weigh little for categories of poor population who do not \nexpect that a democratically elected government will improve their life conditions. We \ncame across anecdotal stories of people in remote poor communities willing to \u2018sell\u2019 \ntheir vote for the promise of a job in a local factory, or for a \u2018gift\u2019 such as the payment \nof a medical treatment. These stories indicate that fair elections may not be considered \nimportant if democratic government is not seen to bring about satisfactory life \nconditions. In such a case, belief in the trustworthiness of electronic elections will \nprobably make little difference for those citizens\u2019 trust in democratic government. \nBut while our study falls short of constructing arguments about the relationship of the \nimplementation ICT-mediated-services and trust-in-government, it makes a start for an \nanalysis of this complex and opaque relationship, and contributes some tentative \narguments about its constituent components. Our distinction between trust and \ntrustworthiness and the differentiation among a number of interrelated entities whose \ntrustworthiness may be at stake are analytical steps for the unpacking of the \nhypothesized overarching relationship of ICT and trust in government. Our focus on \nbeliefs about the trustworthiness led us to identify additional judgements that affect \ncitizens\u2019 views about the electronic elections. Specifically, we discussed briefly the \nfacilitating influence of the perception ICT as a technology with modernizing potential \nin multiple spheres of public life, and of the electoral agency as a competent guarantor \nof the elections.  \nEven from these limited findings we can deduce that the expectation of many \ngovernments in developing countries and development agencies that the \nimplementation of e-government in dysfunctional government agencies will result in \nimproved services and thus will remedy the broken trust of citizens in democratic \ngovernment is misguided. The Brazilian citizens\u2019 view of the trustworthiness of the \nelectronic elections relies on their belief of the TSE itself being trustworthy and \ncommitted to its mission of fair elections. Moreover, this case of e-government built on \nexisting technological competence and a propensity of citizens to welcome government \ninitiatives for ICT innovation. Such conditions of ICT competence and culture are not \ncommon in many developing countries, most of which rely on transferring ICT from \nabroad and often face suspicion about its appropriateness. Therefore, the emulation of \n 13\nthe success of the Brazilian electronic voting system in countries with electoral \ninstitutions which do not enjoy citizens\u2019 confidence as guardians of democratic \nelections and with weak ICT capabilities is rather unlikely. \n \nReferences \nBa, S. & Pavlou, P.
