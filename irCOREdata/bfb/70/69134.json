To\ncontrol these polyphagous herbivores, farmers routinely use large\namounts of broad-spectrum chemical insecticides, killing many\nnon-target arthropods in the process. However, since heliothine\ncaterpillars have a history of developing resistance to almost all the\ninsecticides used for their control [1\u20133], alternative control\nmethods have to be developed. One option is the use of insect-\nresistant genetically engineered (GE) varieties expressing lepidop-\nteran-active Cry proteins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus\nthuringiensis (Bt). So-called Bt cotton plants are grown commercially\nsince 1996. Most of today\u2019s varieties express the Bt protein Cry1Ac\neither alone or in combination with Cry2Ab, protecting plants\nfrom damage by the main pest Lepidoptera [4].\nIn 2007, Bt cotton was grown in nine countries (USA,\nArgentina, Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Australia, Mexico,\nand Colombia) [5]. As cotton is among the most intensively\nsprayed of all field crops, the introduction of Bt cotton has had a\ntremendous impact in terms of reducing insecticide use resulting in\neconomic, environmental and human health benefits [6,7]. The\nfirst eleven years of Bt cotton production (1996\u20132006) have\nresulted in a 22.9% reduction in insecticide active ingredient\napplication in cotton world wide [8]. Insecticide reductions were\nmost significant in India and China where the improved pest\ncontrol also related to significant increases in yield [6,7,9].\nIn India, Bt cotton hybrids expressing the cry1Ac gene are\ncultivated on an increasing area since their introduction in 2002.\nAlmost tripling the area to 3.8 million hectares in 2006, India\nbecame the largest Bt cotton growing country in the world and in\n2007, 131 Bt cotton hybrids were grown on a total of 6.2 million\nhectares [5].\nDue to the reduction of broad spectrum insecticides in Bt\ncotton, herbivores which are not targeted by the Bt protein survive\nand occasionally reach pest status [4]. To retain the biological\ncontrol function provided by naturally occurring antagonists of\nherbivores \u2013i.e. predators and parasitoids\u2013 and to prevent non-\ntarget pest outbreaks, the potential risk that GE crops may pose to\nnatural enemies is addressed as part of the environmental risk\nassessment prior to the commercial release of any novel GE crop\n[10,11]. Several studies examined the effect of Bt crops on\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4804\nherbivores and arthropod natural enemies in recent years\nconfirming the highly selective mode of action of the deployed\nBt Cry proteins [12,13].\nAphids generally play an important role in agricultural food\nwebs since they serve as hosts or prey for a variety of parasitoids\nand predators. Consequently, the question whether aphids are\naffected by the Bt crop and whether they expose their natural\nenemies to the plant-expressed Bt protein is of high relevance.\nStudies available to date provide no evidence that Bt crops,\nexpressing Cry1A proteins for the control of pest Lepidoptera,\ncause direct adverse effects on aphids [14,15]. This is not\nsurprising, since the Bt protein does not appear to be ingested\nby aphids which feed on phloem-sap [15\u201320]. Surprisingly, two\nstudies have reported considerable amounts of Bt Cry proteins in\naphid samples [21,22].\nFurther, aphids and other phloem feeders produce honeydew\nwhich is an important source of carbohydrates for sugar feeding\narthropods, including hymenopteran parasitoids and aphid\npredators [23,24]. Sugars can enhance parasitoid reproductive\nfitness by increasing their longevity, fecundity and\/or parasitism\nrate [25\u201330]. However, honeydew can be a relatively unsuitable\nsugar source as a result of unfavorable sugar composition\n[27,29,30]. Honeydew nutrient composition could also be altered\nas a result of plant transformation.\nTherefore, we investigated in standardized laboratory bioassays\nif the performance of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover\n(Hemiptera: Aphididae), was affected on three Indian Bt cotton\nvarieties (MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184), expressing the\nCry1Ac protein and their corresponding non-transformed near\nisolines. We clarified whether aphids pick up the Bt protein and we\nexamined several aphid life-table parameters,. Furthermore, to\ngain insight into the impact of Bt on the nutrient composition of\naphid honeydew the sugar composition of honeydew was\nexamined.\nResults\nAphid performance\nWith one exception, statistical analyses showed neither a\nBt-transformation nor a cotton variety effect for any of the aphid\nlife-table parameters assessed (three-way ANOVA; P.0.05;\nTable 1). The exception was a significant variety effect for the\nnumber of nymphs produced during a time span equaling the\nnymphal developmental time (FD) (F2,147 = 3.50; P = 0.033) which\nappears to be due to a discrepancy between the varieties MECH\n12 and MECH 184. A significant experimental effect was\ncalculated for the parameters FD, daily fecundity (DF), and total\nlongevity (TL); however, no interaction among the different factors\noccurred.\nTrichome density\nThere was a significant difference in the trichome density\namong the six different cotton plants (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA;\nx2 = 23.07; df = 5; P = 0.033) (Fig. 1). Conducting pair-wise\ncomparisons, a significantly greater trichome density was found\nfor Bt MECH 184 compared to the other two Bt cotton varieties\n(Mann-Whitney U-test; Bt MECH 12; U = 0.00; P = 0.015 and Bt\nMECH 162; U = 0.00; P = 0.010). For the control varieties a\nhigher trichome density was observed for MECH 184 compared\nto MECH 12 (U = 2.00; P = 0.010). No difference in the trichome\ndensity was observed between Bt and non-Bt leaves for any of the\nthree pairs (P.0.05). Remarkably, Bt cotton plants showed a\nconsiderably reduced variability in trichome densities compared to\nBt plants (Fig. 1).\nQuantification of Cry1Ac protein in leaves and aphids\nLeaves of cotton plants on which aphids had fed during the\nbioassay in which aphid performance was evaluated, expressed the\nCry1Ac protein at the following levels (mean6SE); Bt MECH 12:\n0.5860.060 mg Cry1Ac\/g f.w., Bt MECH 162: 0.7360.089 mg\nCry1Ac\/g f.w. and Bt MECH 184: 0.8260.065 mg Cry1Ac\/g f.w.\nAll ELISA readings revealed that aphids that had been kept on\nBt cotton did not contain detectable Cry1Ac protein; i.e. readings\nwere below the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.002 mg\/g f.w. Leaves\nfrom which aphids were collected for ELISA analysis expressed the\nfollowing amounts of Cry1Ac: Bt MECH 12: 0.3460.100 mg\nCry1Ac\/g f.w., Bt MECH 162: 0.6260.191 mg Cry1Ac\/g f.w. and\nBt MECH 184: 0.3860.156 mg Cry1Ac\/g f.w. As expected, none\nof the non-Bt cotton leaves or aphid samples contained any Bt\nprotein.\nSugar analyses in honeydew\nAs it was not possible to determine the exact amount of sugar in\nhoneydew samples in mg\/ml, the sugar composition was presented\nas percentage of total sugar content.\nA total of eleven sugars were found in the aphid honeydew.\nDominant were the phloem sugars, sucrose and fructose, as well as\nthe aphid-synthesized sugar erlose, that together made up 73% (Bt\nMECH 184) to 94% (MECH 162) of the total sugar content.\nSmaller amounts of glucose, trehalose, maltose, mannitol,\nmelibiose, and stachyose were detected in all samples. Sugar\ncomposition appeared to differ between Bt and non-Bt plants as\nwell as among varieties (Fig. 2). Whereas, fructose levels were\nhigher in the honeydew from non-Bt cotton, glucose was amplified\nin honeydew from Bt cotton (especially for Bt MECH 184).\nInterestingly, erlose levels differed noticeably among the cotton\nvarieties. While it was the dominant sugar in the honeydew\ncollected from MECH 162 and Bt MECH 162, a much lower\nproportion of erlose was found in the honeydew of MECH 184\nand Bt MECH 184. The greatest proportion of maltose was\ndetected in MECH 12 and sorbitol was measured in all non-Bt\nsamples (even though at very low levels) but in none of the Bt\nvarieties. Raffinose occurred in just two out of the six treatments\n(MECH 12 and Bt MECH 162).\nPerforming a Principle Components Analysis (PCA) to visualize\nthe data, a negative correlation between the sugars with the\ngreatest influence on data variability (those with the longest vector,\nnamely erlose, glucose, and fructose) could be observed. Glucose,\nsucrose, and trehalose were positively correlated with each other\nand negatively with fructose, maltose, and raffinose (Fig. 3 A). A\npositive correlation among the amount of erlose and sorbitol and a\nnegative correlation with melebiose, stachyose, and mannitol were\nobserved in the data set. Looking at clusters in the biplot graphic,\nit was assumed that the first axis was best explained by the factor\ncotton variety (56%) and the second axis by the factor Bt-\ntransformation (19%; Fig. 3 A). Performing a Redundancy\nAnalysis (RDA) to analyze the influence of the evaluated\nexplanatory variables [transformation (Bt\/non-Bt) and variety\n(MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184)] showed a strong positive\ncorrelation between erlose, trehalose, raffinose, and stachyose with\nthe variety MECH 162, and a negative correlation with the variety\nMECH 184 (Fig. 3 B).

The fact that the first two axes of the RDA only\nexplained 32% of the variance (first axis = 0.249; second\naxis = 0.066), indicated that there were variables other than\ntransformation and variety that could explain the differences in\nhoneydew sugar composition.\nDiscussion\nAphid performance did not differ between Bt and non-Bt cotton\nplants and none of the aphid life-table parameters assessed was\ninfluenced by the expression of the Bt protein. However, there was\na significant difference among cotton varieties for the number of\nnymphs produced during a time span equaling the nymphal\ndevelopmental time (FD). Furthermore, a slight variation in the\nrm-values suggested a small difference among cotton varieties. As\nthe rm is difficult to interpret, the formula e\nx days\u0001rm was used to\ncalculate aphid population growth during one week. According to\nthis formula, a population would have increased by a factor of ten\non Bt and non-Bt cotton plants of the variety MECH 12 while\npopulation increase would have been more pronounced on the\nvarieties MECH 162 (factor 12 or 13) and MECH 184 (factor 13).\nTo detect differences among cotton varieties is not surprising since\ndisparities are known to be caused by different plant character-\nistics, e.g. gossypol level [31] and trichome density [32]. The latter\neffect was also found in our study. While a previous study reported\ndifferences in the trichome density between Bt and non-Bt cotton\nplants [33], this could not be confirmed for the three cotton\nvarieties used in our study. It was noticeable, though, that the\ntrichome density of Bt plants showed considerably less variation as\ncompared to non-Bt plants. The reasons for this discrepancy are\nnot known.\nWhile a previous greenhouse study addressing the performance\nof A. gossypii on Bt and non-Bt cotton plants showed a variation in\nsome life-table parameters among three consecutive generations\n[34], studies comparing aphid populations in Bt and non-Bt cotton\nfields gave inconsistent results. While some studies recorded no\ndifference in aphid populations [35\u201337], others found either\nincreased [38,39] or decreased aphid densities [40] in the Bt crop.\nGiven the results from the greenhouse\/climate chamber studies,\nchanges in aphid populations in cotton fields are unlikely directly\nattributable to the expression of the Bt Cry protein. Rather they\nmay be due to other confounding factors, such as changes in the\nuse of insecticides or increased overall health of the Bt crop [4,41].\nIn Bt maize, a study has shown aphids to perform significantly\nbetter (expressed as increase in aphid numbers) on different Bt\nmaize varieties with different transformation events than on their\nrespective non-transformed control varieties [42]. While slight Bt\nmaize effects on aphid performance had earlier been reported\n[43], other greenhouse studies did not show evidence of such\neffects [15,44,45]. In the field, no or only minimal differences in\naphid densities on Bt and non-Bt maize have been recorded\n[46,47].\nFigure 2. Relative sugar composition (mean percentage+SE) of Aphis gossypii honeydew. Honeydew was collected over a 5 to 6 h interval\nfrom either Bt (Bt MECH 12, Bt MECH 162, Bt MECH 184) or the corresponding non-Bt cotton plants (MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184) (n = 5 to 7).\nLactose, melezitose, mannose, rhamnose, and galactose were not found in any of the samples.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0004804.g002\nAphids on Bt Cotton\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4804\nOur ELISA analyses revealed that none of the aphid samples\ncontained detectable Bt protein. This finding is in accordance with\nmany other studies which reported either no Bt protein or only\ntrace amounts of protein in sap-sucking insects of the order\nHemiptera after feeding on different Bt plants, including maize\n[15\u201317,19], oilseed rape [18], cotton [20], and rice [48,49]. In\ncontrast to the studies listed above, Burgio et al. [22] detected 3%\nof the Cry1Ac protein content expressed by Bt oilseed rape (plant\nexpression level: 64 ng Cry1Ac\/g f.w.) in all of four aphid samples\nthat had been collected in the greenhouse, but only in one out of\neight samples collected from plants kept in a climate chamber (2%\nof the Cry1Ac protein content expressed by Bt oilseed rape). Even\nhigher levels were reported from greenhouse studies by Zhang et\nal. [21] conducting ELISA analyses of aphids which previously\nhad fed on a medium (plant expression level: 49 ng Cry1A\/g f.w.)\nor a high (plant expression level: 94 ng Cry1A\/g f.w.) expressing\nBt cotton line. Surprising in this study was the fact that all ten\naphid samples contained Bt protein after feeding on the medium\nBt-expressing line, compared to only four out of ten samples after\nfeeding on the high Bt-expressing line. Furthermore the positive\naphid samples from the medium expressing Bt cotton plants\ncontained 12% of the Bt content present in the plant while the\naphid samples collected from the high-expressing Bt cotton\ncontained only 4% of the Bt amount found in the plants. It is\nnotable that (with one exception) all positive samples in the two\nstudies listed above were collected in the greenhouse. We argue\nthat one likely reason for the Bt proteins detected in these studies is\ncontamination of the samples by other herbivores such as spider\nmites or thrips or their feces which contain large amounts of Bt\nprotein [19,50,51]. In a preliminary study, we had collected aphids\nfrom Bt cotton that was contaminated with thrips. Great care was\ntaken to check all aphid samples under the binocular microscope,\nboth before releasing the aphids on the cotton plants and again on\nrecollection from the plants to ensure that all herbivores other than\naphids were removed. Nevertheless subsequent ELISA analyses\nstill detected some Bt protein in eleven out of twelve samples (0.02\nto 0.06 mg Cry1Ac\/g f.w. aphids, corresponding to 13\u201325% of the\namount detected in cotton leaves; Lawo unpublished data). These\nprotein levels were 10 to 30 times higher than the limit of detection\nof the ELISA used here. These findings underline that very low\nlevels of contamination are sufficient to produce false positives,\nespecially in samples that contain only traces, or no Bt protein, like\naphids.\nTo prevent potential thrips or spider mite infestations of the\nplants and thus contamination of the aphid samples, our\nexperiment was conducted in a climate chamber instead of a\ngreenhouse. No Bt protein could be detected in any of the aphid\nsamples collected in the climate chamber, even though the Bt\ncotton plants were expressing similar levels of Bt protein compared\nto greenhouse-grown plants. It can thus be concluded that aphids\nfeeding on Bt cotton do not ingest measurable amounts of Bt\nprotein and consequently cannot pass it on to their natural\nenemies. The Cry1Ac expression levels found in the climate\nchamber were lower than those reported for the same cotton\nvarieties from an Indian field study [52]. Comparisons of Bt-\nexpression levels remain difficult, however, since they vary with\nplant age and various environmental factors [53]. Moreover,\nELISA results commonly differ between studies conducted with\ndifferent kits, extraction methods and purified proteins used as\nstandards. Due to the fact that the ELISA measurements were\nvery sensitive (with an LOD of 0.002 mg\/g f.w.), it can be\nconcluded that aphids ingest no or negligible amounts of Cry1Ac\nwhen feeding on Bt cotton even if the expression levels in the field\nmight be higher. Consequently, negligible amounts of Cry1Ac will\nbe passed from aphids to higher trophic levels.\nIn the case of phloem feeders such as aphids, the performance of\nnatural enemies can also be influenced indirectly through the\nnutritional value of the honeydew [54]. The suitability of\nhoneydew as a sugar source can be affected by nutrient\ncomposition [54], as well as by the presence of secondary\nFigure 3. Distribution of sugar composition of honeydew samples from Aphis gossypii. Aphids were fed on Bt (Bt MECH 12, Bt MECH 162,\nBt MECH 184) or the corresponding non-Bt cotton plants (MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184).

The straight lines of the vectors represent the influence of the different sugars (species; Fig. 3 A; B), the triangles the\ncentroids of the environmental variables (variety and Bt; Fig. 3 B). Sugars were expressed as percentage of total sugar.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0004804.g003\nAphids on Bt Cotton\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4804\nmetabolites [23] or insecticidal proteins [55,56]. Honeydew sugar\ncomposition has been found to vary not only among plant species\nand different honeydew-producing insects [29,57\u201359], but also\nwith the insect\u2019s developmental stage [60,61] and age [62], ant\nattendance [63,64], the presence of bacterial symbionts in the\ndigestive tract [65] as well as the rate and duration of insect\ninfestation on the plant [66].\nUsing multivariate statistics to analyze the sugar composition of\nhoneydew collected from A. gossypii feeding on the different\nvarieties of Bt and non-Bt cotton, both variety and transformation\nwere found to have a significant influence. This bioassay is the\nfirst case in which variation in honeydew sugar composition can\nbe attributed to the latter factors. The fact that honeydew\nsugar composition differs among cotton varieties is not surprising\ngiven the fact that the plants generally differ in a range of\nparameters [31,32]. The variation in sugar composition due to\ntransformation might be explained by differences between Bt\ncotton plants and their non-transformed counterparts that go\nbeyond the intentionally introduced genes. The selection process\ntaking place after transformation induces these additional\ndifferences in the plant material. The changes are unlikely caused\nby the expression of the Bt protein since it could clearly be shown\nthat the aphids are not exposed to the insecticidal compound. The\nfact that more glucose was detected in honeydew collected from Bt\nplants (especially Bt MECH 184) compared to that from the\ncontrols may be based on variation in phloem sap composition.\nAlternatively, it may indicate that the carbohydrate assimilation by\nthe aphids was somewhat affected [67]. Either way, it is interesting\nthat this difference did not have any influence on aphid\nperformance. However, for a proper evaluation of the nutritional\nquality of the phloem sap the amino acid composition should\ndirectly be examined. In contrast to our results, Faria et al. [42]\ndid not find any difference in sugar composition in aphid\nhoneydew collected from different Bt and non-Bt maize varieties.\nHowever, the authors reported marginal differences in the amino\nacid composition.\nSince the plant-derived sugars, mainly sucrose, glucose and\nfructose, are the most suitable for honeydew-feeding natural\nenemies [27], honeydew from the cotton variety MECH 184\nmight have increased nutritional properties compared to the other\ntwo varieties tested. However, we believe that this effect should not\nbe overestimated since cotton features multiple nectar and extra-\nfloral nectar sources [68], which are frequently exploited by\nparasitoids [69]. When given a choice, parasitoids may ignore\nhoneydew, and select extrafloral nectar. Among Microplitis croceipes\n(Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) collected from fields with\nand without nectar sources, only individuals from fields lacking\nnectar contained honeydew-specific sugars (Williams and Wa\u00a8ckers\nunpublished data).\nOur studies allow the conclusion that aphid performance is not\naffected by Cry1Ac-expressing Bt cotton plants. This, together\nwith the fact that aphids do not ingest the insecticidal protein when\nfeeding on Bt cotton, indicates that aphid antagonists are unlikely\nto be affected either directly or indirectly when attacking aphids in\na Bt cotton field and that the biological control function they\nprovide should not be compromised. This is also true for generalist\npredators that attack other herbivores on cotton, given the\nLepidoptera-specificity of Cry1Ac [12,13]. In accordance to our\nlaboratory studies, Bambawale et al. [35] observed no difference in\ncotton aphid abundance between Indian fields with Bt cotton\n(MECH 162) and its corresponding near isoline under integrated\npest management. Consequently, aphids are likely to remain\nunder biological control in Bt cotton, which is important for the\nsustainable deployment of this technology.\nMaterials and Methods\nAphis gossypii\nAphis gossypii were provided by Syngenta (Stein, Switzerland)\nand were subsequently reared continuously on cotton (Gossypium\nhirsutum) in a climate chamber at 2561uC, 70610% r.h., and a 16-\nh photoperiod.\nCotton plants\nThree Bt-transgenic Gossypium hirsutum varieties (MECH 12,\nMECH 162, and MECH 184; event BG-I, Mahyco Seeds Ltd.),\nexpressing the Cry1Ac protein (Bt plants) and their corresponding\nnon-transformed near isolines (non-Bt plants) were used in the\nbioassays. All three Bt varieties have been commercially grown in\nIndia since 2002.\nPlants were grown individually in humus-rich sterilized soil in\nplastic pots (3 litre) and fertilized weekly with 10N:10P:8K at a\nconcentration of 20 ml\/l. Plants were grown in a climate chamber,\nilluminated by metal halide lamps (EYE Clean-Ace lamps,\nMT400\/DL\/BH; Iwasaki Electric Co., Ltd.) at 25uC61uC day\/\n20uC61uC night, 70%610% r.h. and a 16-h photoperiod\n(20,000 lux during daytime). Changes between day and night\nconditions occurred gradually to simulate natural dusk and dawn.\nMetal halide lamps featured a light color close to daylight. To\nguarantee stable humidity, plants were placed individually in plant\ndishes (16 cm in diameter; 3 cm high). Plants were watered once a\nday until the eight-leaf stage, after which they were watered twice\ndaily. Prior to bioassays cotton plants were controlled visually for\nany insect damage to avoid unintended induction of the cotton\ninnate resistance mechanisms.\nExperimental set-up\nFor one bioassay, 15 metal trays (45690 cm) were placed in two\nrows on the floor of the climate chamber, each containing six,\nthree-week old plants (two to five true leaves). The plants, one of\neach Bt and non-Bt variety, were ordered randomly per tray\n(complete block design). The bioassay was repeated twice resulting\nin a total of 30 plants per treatment. Environmental conditions\nwere the same as described above for cultivation of the plants.\nAphid performance\nA group of approximately 50 reproductive aphids from\nthe permanent culture were allowed to settle on a plant and\nto give birth to nymphs. After 6 h, two to three newborn\nnymphs (F1) were brushed carefully onto the last fully expanded\nleaf of the respective variety and covered with a clip cage (2 cm\nin diameter; 1 cm high). Clip cages featured a hole sealed\nwith fine-mesh netting to provide air-circulation. After three\ndays, surplus nymphs were removed at random, to ensure that\nthe performance of a single nymph was monitored on each\nplant. Every morning and evening, aphid mortality was recorded.\nAfter reaching adulthood the F1 nymphs were counted and\nremoved daily. This procedure was conducted until the aphid\ndied.\nThe following aphid life-table parameters were obtained\nthis way: nymphal developmental time (time from birth to\nfirst nymphal production; D), number of nymphs produced\nduring a time span equal to D starting at nymph produc-\ntion (FD), mean reproductive rate during the reproductive\nperiod observed (daily fecundity; DF), total fecundity per female\nduring the period observed (TF), adult longevity (AL), total\nlongevity (TL), and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm). The\nrm was estimated based on the daily age-specific fecundity (mx) and\nthe age-specific survival rate (lx) and using the equation of Birch\nAphids on Bt Cotton\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4804\n[70] (1):\nX\nx\nlx:mx:e\n{rmx~1 \u00f01\u00de\nAphids that died before producing any nymphs were excluded\nfrom the analysis. Aphids which were lost during the observation\nperiod were censored.\nTrichome density\nAfter the death of the aphid, the leaf below the one exposed to\nthe aphid was collected and stored at 220uC until further\nexamination. For each leaf, three trichome counts were taken from\na central section of the lower surface, excluding the primary and\nsecondary leaf veins. Depending on trichome density, measure-\nments were done on an area of 16 or 64 mm2 (for high or low\ntrichome density, respectively) under a binocular microscope\n(WILD, Heerbrugg) with the help of an ocular measuring grid\n(Leica). Six to eight samples were counted per treatment and\nsubsequently data were calculated as trichome density per cm2.\nQuantification of Cry1Ac protein in leaves and aphids\nTo confirm Cry1Ac expression of the transgenic cotton plants\nused in both bioassays, a total of 12 to 13 leaves per variety of the\nBt plants and three leaves per variety of the non-Bt plants were\ncollected after the end of the bioassays. Approximately 100 mg\nfresh weight (f.w.) of the leaves on which A. gossypii had fed were\nsampled, flash frozen, weighed, lyophilized and weighed again\n(approximately 20 mg dry weight).\nTo quantify the level of Cry1Ac in A. gossypii, 60 to 70\nreproductive aphids were brushed on the last fully expanded leaf of\nthree-week old Bt or non-Bt cotton plants and allowed to\nreproduce for five weeks. Subsequently, leaves infested with\naphids were transferred to two to three-week old cotton plants of\nthe same variety and transformation status and reared under the\nsame climatic conditions. Aphids were allowed to settle and\nreproduce for one to two additional weeks. Thereafter, 30 to\n80 mg of aphids was collected using a flexible tube on which gauze\nand a tip were attached. Before weighing and lyophilizing, each\nsample was checked under a binocular microscope to confirm that\nthere was no contamination with other pests (e.g., spider mites or\nthrips) or leaf pieces. Three to five samples per Bt variety and one\nper non-Bt variety were analyzed. From the same plants on which\naphids were kept, samples from two of the most heavily infested\nleaves were also taken for Bt protein measurements.\nThe amount of Cry1Ac protein in leaf and aphid material was\nmeasured using an enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA)\nfrom Agdia (Elkhart Indiana, USA). After adding phosphate\nbuffered saline with Tween buffer (PBST, provided in the kit) at a\nratio of 1:10 (sample material f.w.:buffer) and a 5 mm tungsten\ncarbide bead, leaf samples were macerated for 100 sec at 15 Hz\nand aphid samples for 40 sec at 30 Hz, using a mixer mill MM300\n(Retsch, Haan, Germany) fitted with 24 tube-adapters (Qiagen,\nHombrechtikon, Switzerland). Samples were centrifuged for 5 min\nat 13,0006g and leaf samples were diluted 1:15 with PBST, while\naphid samples were not diluted. Subsequently, instructions from\nthe kit were followed. After stopping the color development with\n3 M sulfuric acid, spectrophotometric measurements were con-\nducted with a microtiter plate reader (SpectrafluorPlus, Tecan,\nMa\u00a8nnedorf, Switzerland) at 450 nm. A standard curve with\npurified high quality Cry1Ac provided by M. Pusztai-Carey (Dept.\nBiochemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH,\nUSA) was established. Concentrations were calculated using linear\nregression analysis. The limit of detection for aphid extracts was\ncalculated by multiplying three times the standard deviation of\neleven buffer-only and control ODs with the slope of the standard\ncurve. Based on mg\/g f.w., the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.002.\nSugar analysis of aphid honeydew\nFor sugar analysis, approximately 50 mg of aphids was collected\nfrom the rearing colony in a clip cage (5.2 cm in diameter; 1 cm\nhigh) in the afternoon and allowed to settle overnight on the\nyoungest fully expanded cotton leaf. The cage was removed the\nfollowing morning and the aphids were allowed to settle one\nadditional day.\nFor honeydew collection, Petri dishes were placed under the\naphid infested cotton leaves for 5 to 6 h. Thereafter, honeydew-\nsprinkled Petri dishes were placed upside down at 2361uC and\n8565% r.h., with a water-saturated piece of cotton wool on the\nbottom. After 2 h, when the viscosity of the honeydew was\nreduced through hygroscopy, approximately 0.5 ml honeydew was\ncollected with 5 ml micropipettes (Blaubrand, intra Mark).\nSubsequently, the honeydew was dissolved in 20 ml ethanol\n(70%) and stored at 280uC until further analysis.\nFor sugar analysis of aphid honeydew, five to seven samples per\ntreatment were tested for 16 sugars: sucrose, fructose, glucose,\nerlose, trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, melibiose, raffinose, stachyose,\nlactose, melezitose, mannose, rhamnose, maltose and galactose.\nBefore analysis, samples were diluted 400-fold with 18 MV water\nand homogenized using a pestle. Subsequently, samples were\nfiltered through a chromacol syringe filter. Samples were analyzed\nusing a Dionex ICS 3000 Ion Chromatography system (Dionex\nCorp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and concentrations of the individual\nsugars were calculated using the program PEAKNET Software\nRelease 5.1 as described by Steppuhn and Wa\u00a8ckers [71]. The limit\nof quantification for any honeydew sample was set at 0.001 mg.\nMeasurements below 0.001 mg were set to 0.\nData analysis\nSince all assumptions were met, FD, DF, and TF were tested\nwith a multivariate ANOVA including the factors Bt\/non-Bt,\nvariety, and experiment. Means were subsequently compared\nusing the Tukey-Kramer Test. D, AL, and TL were analyzed by\nmeans of a Cox regression model including the factors Bt\/non-Bt,\nvariety, and experiment. Insects which were lost over the\nobservation period were censored. To estimate the confidence\nintervals for the rm, the bootstrap percentile method with 10,000\nresamples was performed [72].\nTrichome density was compared among all treatments with a\nKruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by pair-wise comparisons using\nthe Mann-Whitney U-test, adjusted for ties. The two-sided exact\nP-value was subsequently corrected with the Bonferroni-Holm\nprocedure. Statistical analyses were conducted using the software\npackage Statistica (version 6, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) or R\n(bootstrap). The a-level was 5% in all statistical analyses.\nTo calculate the sugar composition of the different Bt and non-\nBt varieties, firstly, the lengths of gradient was calculated. Since the\nvalue was ,3, the use of linear models was justified. Therefore, an\nunconstrained linear ordination (indirect gradient analysis) using\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA) on sugar percentages\n(species data) was conducted to visualize the important patterns\nin the data. Additionally, the distribution of the sugar concentra-\ntions was investigated by constrained linear ordination (direct\ngradient analysis), using Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to analyze\nthe variability between Bt and non-Bt plants and\/or among\nvarieties based on the composition of different sugars. The\ntransformation (Bt\/non-Bt) and variety (MECH 12, MECH 162,\nMECH 184) were used as explanatory variables.
