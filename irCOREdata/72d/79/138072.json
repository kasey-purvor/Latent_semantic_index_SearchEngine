Atlas and Bartha [1] concluded that the \ndisappearance of crude-oil from seawater could be accelerated by the addition of \nnutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorus or both. Recommendations have been \nadvocated for the microbial seeding of oil spills, because bacteria and fungi are the only \nbiological species which have the metabolic capability of utilizing petroleum carbon for \ncell synthesis [2]. Also, oil spills result in an imbalance in the carbon-nitrogen ratio at the \nspill site, because crude-oil is essentially a mixture of carbon and hydrogen. This causes a \nnitrogen deficiency in an oil-soaked soil, which retards the growth of bacteria and the \nutilization of carbon source(s). In addition to a nitrogen deficiency in oil-soaked soil, \ncertain nutrients like phosphorus may be growth-rate limiting [2]. Furthermore, large \nconcentrations of biodegradable organics in the top layer of agricultural soils deplete \noxygen reserves in the soil and slow down the rates of oxygen diffusion to deeper layers \n[3]. Crude-oil pollution tends to persist in soils until remediation measures, involving the \napplication of nutrients are resorted to, because oxygen and nitrogen are limiting factors \nin all types of petroleum degradation.  \n \nThe application of a fertilizer plus implementing certain agro-technical processes like \ntilling, were as effective as the use of bio-augmentation with indigenous hydrocarbon-\nutilizing bacteria (HUB) plus fertilizer application and tilling, in the degradation of the \nhydrocarbon contaminant. This is because HUB is present in almost all types of soils in \ntropical rain-forests and would multiply where the right types and concentrations of \nmetabolic feedstock exist [4]. This research is highly relevant to the Niger Delta region of \nNigeria, where frequent oil-spills arising from crude-oil exploration-and-development \nactivities have devastated farm lands and other agricultural settlements [5]. Hence, \nbiostimulation with agricultural fertilizers was investigated in this remediation study. The \naims were: \n \n\u2022 To evaluate the process of biostimulation achieved by the addition of agricultural \nfertilizers to petroleum-polluted agricultural soils. \n \n\u2022 To determine the total quantity and application rate of the fertilizer and other \nenvironmental conditions that would be effective, and the optima for the \nbiodegradation process. \n \n\u2022 To study the types of HUB, and to relate the total heterotrophic bacterial counts to \nthe fertilizer applications. \n \n 3\nMaterials and Methods \n \nStudy Area \nThis investigation was undertaken at the research farm of the Rivers State University of \nScience and Technology, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Port Harcourt is the capital of Rivers \nState and economical the most important city in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. From \nthis region, more than 98% of Nigeria\u2019s current economic mainstay, namely crude-oil, is \nderived. Port Harcourt is within the tropical rain-forest zone with an ambient \nenvironment having: a mean annual rainfall of 2400mm; a mean monthly relative \nhumidity of 85%; a mean daily minimum temperature of about 23oC and a mean daily \nmaximum temperature of 31.5oC [6]. The soil is normally moisture laden due to the high \nannual rainfall, which results in surface run-offs, rivulets and streams, which may convey \nsubstances like crude-oil to contaminate nearby land and rivers [4]. \n \nExperimental Design \nThe tested soil was divided into six treatment sample-cells, each horizontally extending \n40cm x 40cm and depth 30cm. The cells were such that the depth and exposed surface-\narea of the soil, and in turn its temperature, nutrient concentration, moisture content and \noxygen availability, could be controlled [7]. Furthermore, the cells inhibited excess run-\noffs of the crude-oil contaminant: such run-offs were inevitable since the remediation \nstudy took place from June to August 2005, in the open air and so exposed to the rains. \nCell O was the control volume, i.e. did not receive any treatment, whereas cells A, B, C, \nD and E were earmarked to receive 50g, 75g, 100g, 150g and 200g of 20-10-10 NPK \nfertilizer respectively, twice during the remediation period, i.e. at two-week intervals. \n \nSoil Treatment \nPrior to the fertilizer application, 800cm3 (i.e. 0.8 litres) of Bonny light crude-oil was \nsprinkled upon the earth in each of the cells (including the control cell) from a perforated \ncan at the rate of 0.8 litres of crude-oil per 0.16m2 of soil: hence, the surface of the earth \nin each cell was completely covered with a thin layer of oil. The objective was to \nsimulate conditions of a major spill. The cells were left undisturbed (i.e. in the open air) \nfor three days. Then the treatments i.e. different amounts of fertilizer were applied but \nequal rates of tilling were used. The various treatment cells were tilled twice a week with \ncutlasses and shovels to provide the necessary aeration and mixing of nutrients and \nmicrobes with the contaminated soil. The aforementioned quantities of fertilizer were \napplied, sprinkled to the relevant cells and well worked to at least 30cm depth in each \ncell. Thus, the equivalent of 6.25 ton\/ha, 9.375 ton\/ha, 12.5 ton\/ha, 18.75 ton\/ha and 25 \nton\/ha were applied to the cells A, B, C, D and E respectively. These amounts of fertilizer \nsupplied 1250 kg\/ha, 1875kg\/ha, 2500kg\/ha, 3750kg\/ha and 5000kg\/ha of nitrogen for the \nsix- week remediation period. \n \nSoil Samples \nThese were obtained using a 22-cm hand-dug soil auger and put in labelled polyethylene \nbags. The samples for the Total Hydrocarbon Content (THC) measurements were placed \nin one litre glass bottles and sealed with aluminium foil. This procedure was undertaken \n 4\nthree times to form three replicates. The bags and glass bottles were immediately \ntransferred to the laboratory for analysis. \n \nAnalysis of Soil Characteristics \nMeasures were made of some of the soil\u2019s physicochemical parameters, such as particle-\nsize distribution; THC; concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen and moisture in the \nsoil; the soil\u2019s pH value; its electrical conductivity and bacteria counts. Particle-size \nanalyses were obtained by the Bouyoucous hydrometer method, as modified by Day [8]. \nThe THC was measured using the procedure described by Odu et al [9], while the \norganic-carbon content was determined by the wet combustion method of Walkey and \nBlack [10]. The total nitrogen and moisture contents as well as the soil\u2019s pH value and \nelectrical conductivity were determined using methods adapted from Odu et al [9], Smith \nand Smith [11] and Jackson [12] respectively. The microbial analyses and bacterial \ncounts were carried out following the procedure described by Harrigan and McCane [13], \nCowan [14] and Buchanan and Gibbons [15]. \n \nLeast Significant Difference (LSD), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Correlation \nCoefficient methods were employed to analyze the measured data [16]. These were used \nto determine the relationship between time and the soil characteristics during  the \nremediation process. \n \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nThe soil\u2019s characteristics that were used as indicators of the levels of pollution and \nremediation, before and after the crude-oil contamination, as well as during remediation \nprocess, are presented in Tables 1\u21924. The particle-size analyses of the 30cm thick, top \nlayer of the soil before treatment showed that the soil texture is silty clay (see Table 1). \n \nThe soil\u2019s moisture-content prior to contamination averaged 13%. It dropped to about 8% \n(in cell A) after contamination, prior to remediation, and increased later in all the cells \nduring remediation because of the rainfall. Rowell [17] reported that in heavily-polluted \nsoils, water droplets adhere to the hydrophobic layer, and this prevents the wetting of the \nsoil aggregates. As a result, during the study, the cells were remediated through the \nintroduction of fertilizers and tilling. This process continued throughout the month of \nJuly, during which the maximum rate of rainfall occurs in this part of Nigeria [6], and \nresulted in the significant increases in the moisture content, i.e. to as high as 19% in cell \nA. Such moisture conditions are typical of silty-clay soils due to their high moisture-\nretention capacity. There was a correlation (r = +0.073) between soil moisture content \nand the remediation period, which was not significant either at the 1% or 5% probability \nlevels (Table 5). \n \n \n \n \n \n 5\nTable 1: Physicochemical characteristics of the silty-clay soil before its crude-oil \ncontamination \n(Results represent the means + standard deviation of treatment cells) \nPercentage (%)  by mass Percentage by mass \nSand Silt Clay Moisture \npH \n \n1: 2.5 \nEC \n \n\u00b5S \/ \ncm \nTHC \n \nmg \/ \nkg Organic C \nTotal \nN \n\u2248C \/ N ratio \n12.4 \n+ 0.4 \n40.1 \n + 0.2 \n47.5  \n+ 0.5 \n13 \n + 1 \n4.7  \n+ 0.1 \n28  \n+ 2 \n84  \n+ 10 \n0.19  \n+0.02 \n0.38  \n+ 0.03 \n0.5 \n + 0.01 \n \nTable 2: Soil\u2019s physicochemical characteristics 3 days after contamination, but \n    prior to any remediation being undertaken \n (Results represent the means + standard deviation of three replicates) \nPercentage  \nCell \n% moisture \nby mass \npH \n1: 2.5 \nEC \n\u00b5S\/cm \nTHC \nmg \/ kg Organic C Total N \n\u2248C \/ N ratio \nO 12 + 2 5.93 + 0.20 75 + 4 14,433 + 20 0.38 + 0.05 0.20 + 0.01 2 + 0.5 \n A 8 + 1 5.84 + 0.25 71 + 3 10,259 + 50 0.31 + 0.02 0.19 + 0.01 2 + 0.5 \nB 11 + 1 5.89 + 0.10 71 + 5 14,707 + 150 0.35 + 0.04 0.21 + 0.02 2 + 0.4 \nC 10 + 2 6.01 + 0.15 79 + 2 15,414 + 100 0.39 + 0.05 0.19 + 0.03 2 + 0.6 \nD 17 + 1 5.88 + 0.25 73 + 3 14,070 + 100 0.42 + 0.03 0.24 + 0.01 2 + 0.2 \nE 18 + 1 5.91 + 0.20 78 + 4 13,089 + 250 0.39 + 0.03 0.22 + 0.04 2 + 0.3 \n \nTable 3: Soil\u2019s physicochemical characteristics 2 weeks after remediation \n (Results represent the means + standard deviation of three replicates) \nPercentage  \nCell \n% moisture \nby mass \npH \n1: 2.5 \nEC \n\u00b5S\/cm \nTHC \nmg \/ kg Organic C Total N \n\u2248C \/ N ratio \nO 12 + 2 5.51 + 0.10 40 + 7 15,565 + 40 0.032 + 0.003 0.190 + 0.05 4 + 0.5 \nA 16 + 1 5.42 + 0.05 106 + 13 6,063 + 100 0.268 + 0.01 0.090 + 0.007 3 + 0.6 \nB 20 + 1 5.35 + 0.10 31 + 4 7,928 + 250 0.270 + 0.05 0.068 + 0.06 4 + 0.6 \nC 14 + 1 5.49 + 0.20 96 + 5 7,125 + 200 0.280 + 0.02 0.072 + 0.006 4 +0.4 \nD 18 + 2 5.56 + 0.15 32 + 4 4,535 + 180 0.315 + 0.01 0.086 + 0.007 4 + 0.5 \nE 16 + 1 5.70 + 0.10 215 + 15 1,659 + 210 0.305 + 0.06 0.068 + 0.006 4 + 0.6 \n 6\nTable 4: Soil physicochemical characteristics 6 weeks after remediation \n (Results represent the means + standard deviation of three replicates) \n \nPercent  \nCell \n% moisture \nby mass \npH \n1: 2.5 \nEC \n\u00b5S\/cm \nTHC \nmg \/ kg Organic C Total N \n\u2248C \/ N ratio \nO 18 + 0.5 5.74 + 0.10 23 + 5 19,414 + 90 0.19 + 0.05  0.032 + 0.003 6 + 0.8 \nA 19 + 0.5 5.95 + 0.15 72 + 6 530 + 30 0.14 + 0.04 0.030 + 0.002 5 + 0.6 \nB 16 + 1 5.85 + 0.25 90 + 9 1,043 + 180 0.18 + 0.05 0.030 + 0.002 6 + 0.8 \nC 16 + 1 5.94 + 0.30 94 + 8 1,202 + 150 0.18 + 0.05 0.030 + 0.002 6 + 0.7 \nD 16 + 1 6.08 + 0.30 97 + 6 5,236 +220  0.20 + 0.06 0.034 + 0.003 6 + 0.6 \nE 14 + 1.5 6.05 + 0.30 256 + 12 6,581 + 200 0.22 + 0.07 0.037 + 0.005 6 + 0.5 \n \nThe soil\u2019s pH increased in all the cells after contamination with crude-oil. It later decreased \nduring the remediation treatment: after the six weeks total remediation period, it increased \nin all the options once again ( see Tables 1\u21924). Tisdale and Nelson [18] made a similar \nobservation and reported that the decrease in pH during remediation treatment may have \nresulted from the production of acid radicals through the process of nitrification of the \napplied fertilizer. There was no significant change in the effect of remediation treatment on \nthe soil\u2019s pH value at 5% probability levels. Similarly, the electrical conductivity (EC) of \nthe earth in the cells generally increased. The soluble salt-content in the soil, which was \ndue to the introduction of the inorganic fertilizer, caused the general increase in the EC. \nOdu et al [9] made a similar observation. There was a correlation (r = +0.106) between \nsoil\u2019s EC and time elapsed (see Table 5).  \n \nA sharp increase in the soil\u2019s carbon (C) content resulted from the crude-oil contamination; \nso corroborating Jobson et al [2]. However, the organic carbon content dropped to near \nbackground conditions during the remediation treatment. In this study, the relationship \nbetween organic carbon content and remediation period showed a correlation (r = - 0.187). \nThis suggests that the amount of carbon reduced with time (see Table 5). On the other \nhand, the total nitrogen (N) content for the various options decreased upon prolonging the \nperiod of remediation, contrary to expectation that it would naturally increase with the \napplication of the nitrogenous fertilizer.  A hypothesis that would account for such \nbehaviour is that the bacterial population was readily utilizing the available nitrogen for \nhydrocarbon degradation: hence the available nitrogen was diminishing with time. Brady \nand Weil [19] made a similar observation and concluded that, during biodegradation, \nnitrogen may be lost to the atmosphere when nitrate ions are converted to gaseous forms of \nnitrogen by a series of widely-occurring biochemical-reduction reactions, brought about by \ndenitrifying bacteria, such as pseudomonas, bacillus and micrococcus, especially when \nlocalized micro-sites of low oxygen exist well within the soil aggregates. The correlation \n 7\nanalysis, between the total nitrogen content and remediation period, showed a negative \nrelationship (r = - 0.341) at a 5% probability level (Table 5). \n \nTable 5: The relationships between time elapsed after remediation to measured soil \ncharacteristics  during remediation as expressed by correlation coefficients and regression: \nthe g level is not significant at the 1-5% probability levels \n \nCorrelation regression \nfactor \nCorrelation \ncoefficient, r \nSignificance equation \ntime vs. moisture +0.073       y = 17.1 + 0.3x \ntime vs. pH +0.037 y = 5.54 + 0.05x \ntime vs. THC -0.260 y = 3170 \u2013 255x \ntime vs. organic C -0.187 y = 0.196 \u2013 0.01x \ntime vs. total N -0.341 y = 0.037 \u2013 0.0x \ntime vs. C\/N ratio +0.182         y = 4.0 + 0.2x \ntime vs. EC +0.106 y = 98.6 + 2.6x \n \nThere was a marked decrease in the percentage of the THC in all the earth samples in the \ncells except for that in the control cell, for which the THC increased. After six weeks of \nremediation, the percentage THC reductions for the treatment cells were 95%, 93%, 92%, \n63%, and 50% for cells A, B, C, D and E respectively (see Figure 1). The results indicate \nthat the applied fertilizer increased the degradation of the hydrocarbons since the THC of \nthe control cell that received no fertilizer treatment was on the increase. The continuous \nrise of the THC of the control cell was due to the existing anaerobic conditions, these \nresulted because the control-cell earth was not tilled at all, so there was insufficient oxygen \nsupply and hence anaerobic decomposition ensued resulting in organic materials (methane \n(CH4) and carbon dioxide, the former \u2013 a hydrocarbon) being produced and hence the \nincrease in the THC. \n \nIt is evident, from Table 6, that different concentrations of fertilizer affect the rate of \ndegradation. The behaviour of the cells, after two weeks of remediation, and at the end of \nthe remediation period, reveals that certain optima exist, which, when exceeded, cause \ndiminishing returns.  From the results in Table 6, it can be inferred that for quantities of \nfertilizer between 200g and 300g per 0.16m2, there was an excess of nutrients, which \nprobably reduced the activity of the microbes in the soil. The THC was increasing in cells \nD and E at six weeks after remediation. Vance [20] observed a similar behaviour: the \nsudden increase in contaminant concentration was probably induced by the high levels of \nbacterial activity stimulated in the hydrocarbon-rich soil.  The microbes excreted extra-\ncellular surfactant-like polymers during their metabolic cycle: these resulted in the \nhydrocarbons being of low concentrations in the cells from which the samples were \ncollected.  \n \n \n \n 8\nTable 6: Percentage THC Reductions \n \nSampling Period (Weeks)  \nTreatment Cell 2 6 \n \nA \n \n41 \n \n95 \n \nB \n \n46 \n \n93 \n \nC \n \n54 \n \n92 \n \nD \n \n68 \n \n63 \n \nE \n \n87 \n \n50 \n \nResults of the total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) count showed that there was a general \nincrease in the THB in all the cells (Table 7). However, cell E and the control cell exhibited \ndifferent behaviours. The control cell, of those tested, increased at the lowest rate.  \nOdokuma and Dickson [4] observed a similar behaviour and noted that the relatively low \nvalues obtained in the control cell may have resulted from the toxicity of the crude-oil to \nthe soil microbes, brought about by the high concentration of the crude-oil before the \nremediation treatment. For cell E, the increase in the THB count was significant within the \nfirst two weeks. It later increased at a slower rate during the remaining four weeks.  This \nmay have been due to the retardation of microbial activity resulting from the high \nconcentration of ammonia gas released from the fertilizer, because most commercial \nfertilizers supply nitrogen in soluble forms, such as nitrate or ammonium. This has been \nreported previously by Brady and Weil [19]. The hydrocarbon-utilizing bacterial types \nisolated from the soil samples were bacillus, corynebacterium, pseudomonas, \nflavobacterium, micrococcus, acinetobacter and aerococcus.     \n 9\n \n    \n     Figure 1: Rate of hydrocarbon loss  \n \n    Table 7:  Total heterotrophic bacterial count. \n \nSampling Period (Weeks) \n0 2 6 \n \n \nCell Heterotrophic bacteria count ( 10 5 Cfu\/ml) \n \nO \n \n8.9 \n \n12.8 \n \n15.3 \n \nA \n \n3.5 \n \n18.6 \n \n26.8 \n \nB \n \n6.2 \n \n16.2 \n \n26.4 \n \nC \n \n5.9 \n \n17.0 \n \n28.4 \n \nD \n \n10.1 \n \n19.4 \n \n28.4 \n \nE \n \n4.8 \n \n19.6 \n \n21 \n \nThe background (i.e. pre- contaminated) samples had a bacterial count of 3.3x105 Cfu\/ml.  \n \n \nConclusions and Recommendations \n \nNutrient-enhanced bioremediation can achieve the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons \nin agricultural soils.

The application of 200g or 12.5 ton\/ha (Cell C) produced a 92% hydrocarbon loss. \nCell D (which received 18.75 ton\/ha or 300g of fertilizer) had a 63% loss.  Cell E (which \nreceived 400g or 25 ton\/ha) recorded the lowest rate (i.e. 50%) of hydrocarbon degradation \nafter the six-week period. Thus between 75 and 200g of fertilizer per 0.16m2 (i.e. 4.7\u219212.5 \nton\/ha) will lead to the fastest biodegradation. For this to occur, certain optima should \napply, i.e. a pH value in the  range 5.5\u21926.0, moisture content between 14 and 19% during \nthe wet season and a tillage rate of between 2 and 5 times a week. \n  \n \nFor an effective bioremediation: \n\u2022 Nitrogenous-based fertilizers (preferably NPK type) should be used and an \napplication of between 4.7 and 12.5 ton\/ha should be resorted to achieve an \naccelerated biodegradation.  \n\u2022 Bioremediation should be applied during the dry season, because a wet soil \ninduces anaerobic conditions that impede accelerated biodegradation. When \ndone during the wet season, the rate of tillage or soil aeration should be \nincreased to about five times a week to facilitate adequate mixing of the \nnutrients and microbes with the contaminated soil and also to enhance the \ndiffusion rate of oxygen to the deeper layers. \n \nReferences \n \n1.
