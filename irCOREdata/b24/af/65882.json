Bolton and L. Vrancken\nAbstract\nWe define two transforms between minimal surfaces with non-circular ellipse of cur-\nvature in the 5-sphere, and show how this enables us to construct, from one such\nsurface, a sequence of such surfaces. We also use the transforms to show how to\nassociate to such a surface a corresponding ruled minimal Lagrangian submanifold of\ncomplex projective 3-space, which gives the converse of a construction considered in\na previous paper, and illustrate this explicitly in the case of bipolar minimal surfaces.\nKey words: Sphere, minimal surface, ellipse of curvature, Lagrangian submanifold,\ncomplex projective space.\nSubject class: 53B25, 53B20.\n1 Introduction\nLet f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion of a surface S into the unit 5-sphere. The\nimage of the unit circle in the tangent space under the second fundamental form of f is\na central planar ellipse E in the normal space of f called the ellipse of curvature. Let\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 pi\/2 be such that cos \u03b8 is the ratio of the lengths of the minor and major axes\nof E. The geometrical significance of \u03b8 lies in the fact that if R\u03b8 is the rotation of the\nnormal space through angle \u03b8 about the minor axis of E then the orthogonal projection of\nR\u03b8(E) onto the plane containing E is a circle. If N is the unit vector in the normal space\northogonal to the plane containing E, then the transform we will consider is obtained by\napplying R\u03b8 to N . Of course, there are certain choices of sign and orientation to be made\nhere, and the various choices available give two essentially different transforms. We shall\nshow that these transformed surfaces are also minimal, and that the two transforms are\nmutual inverses. This enables us to define a sequence {fp : p \u2208 Z} of minimal immersions\ninto S5(1) with f 0 = f , and we instigate an investigation of this sequence.\nThe transforms described above are natural generalisations of the polar construction\n[10] for superconformal minimal surfaces in S3(1) and S5(1) (although when the ambient\nspace is S3(1) the polar is simply the unit normal to the immersion). In the latter situation,\nthe ellipse of curvature is a circle, the angle of rotation \u03b8 is zero, and in both situations the\n0We are grateful to the London Mathematical Society for financial support during the preparation of\nthis paper.\n1\nsequence of minimal immersions is periodic with period two. Our motivation for discovering\nand studying these transforms comes from [3], where we showed how to associate two\nminimal surfaces in S5(1) to a ruled minimal Lagrangian submanifold of complex projective\n3-space. We showed that these minimal surfaces were related by the above transforms. In\nthe present paper we show that the construction described in [3] may be reversed, thus\nshowing that all minimal surfaces in S5(1) whose ellipse of curvature is not a circle may\nbe constructed using the methods of [3]. We then illustrate this explicitly in the case of\nbipolar minimal surfaces [10] in S5(1).\n2 Minimal surfaces in S5(1)\nFor the rest of the paper, f : S \u2192 S5(1) will denote a minimal immersion of an oriented\nsurface S into S5(1). We use the orientation and induced metric to give S the structure\nof a Riemann surface in such a way that f is a conformal immersion. If II denotes the\nsecond fundamental form of f in S5(1) we recall that for each p \u2208 S the subset E(p) of\nthe first normal space of S at p given by\nE(p) = {II(X,X) | X is a unit tangent vector to S at p}\nis a (possibly degenerate) central ellipse called the ellipse of curvature of S at p.\nIn this section, we assume that S has non-circular non-degenerate ellipse of curvature\nat every point. We show how to associate a complex moving frame to such an immersion,\nand obtain the moving frame equations and integrability conditions. The approach we use\nis based on the theory of harmonic sequences, which is described in [5] for the more general\nsituation of minimal surfaces in Sm(1) or CPm(4).\nLet z = x + iy be a local complex coordinate on S, and denote \u2202\n\u2202z\nby \u2202 and \u2202\n\u2202z\u00af\nby \u2202\u00af.\nWe introduce C6-valued functions f0, f1, f2 by\nf0 = f, (1)\nf1 = \u2202f, (2)\nf2 = II(\u2202, \u2202), (3)\nwhere II now denotes the complex bilinear extension of the second fundamental form of\nf in S5(1). If ( , ) is the complex bilinear extension of the standard inner product on\nR6, it follows that (f0, f1) = 0 while conformality of f is equivalent to\n(f1, f1) = 0. (4)\nThus f0, f1, f\u00af1 are mutually orthogonal and f2 is the component of \u2202f1 orthogonal to f0,\nf1, f\u00af1. We note that, by Takahashi\u2019s Lemma [12], the minimality of f is equivalent to\n\u2202\u2202\u00aff0 = \u00b5f0 for some real-valued function \u00b5.\nIf f2 = a\u2212 ib where a, b are R6-valued functions, it follows from conformality of f that\nthe ellipse of curvature is homothetic to the image of the map\n\u03c8 7\u2192 II(cos\u03c8 \u2202\n\u2202x\n+ sin\u03c8 \u2202\n\u2202y\n, cos\u03c8 \u2202\n\u2202x\n+ sin\u03c8 \u2202\n\u2202y\n) = 2(a cos 2\u03c8 + b sin 2\u03c8). (5)\n2\nSince the ellipse of curvature is not a circle we see that (f2, f2) 6= 0. As noticed by Hopf,\nthe function (f2, f2) is holomorphic, so that [4] there exists a complex coordinate z (which\nwe will call an adapted complex coordinate for f), defined up to rotations by pi\n2\n, such that\n(f2, f2) = \u22121. In this case\n\u22121 = (f2, f2) = (a, a)\u2212 (b, b)\u2212 2i(a, b),\nso that\n(a, a)\u2212 (b, b) = \u22121, (a, b) = 0. (6)\nIt now follows from (5) that a lies along the minor axis and b the major axis of E. It\nfollows from (6) that there is a non-negative function \u03c6 such that\n|a| = sinh\u03c6, |b| = cosh\u03c6, (7)\nso that the eccentricity e of E is given by\ne =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 |a|2|b|2 = sech\u03c6. (8)\nAt points where the ellipse of curvature is non-degenerate, a and b are linearly independent,\nand \u03c6 is positive. Thus f2 and f\u00af2 are also linearly independent, and we complete our com-\nplex moving frame for f by letting N be a real unit vector orthogonal to {f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2}.\nIt is then straightforward to check that if F = {f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2, N} and if \u03c9 = log |f1|2,\nthen the matrix A of complex bilinear inner products of the frame vectors of F is given by\nA =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 e\u03c9 0 0 0\n0 e\u03c9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 \u22121 cosh 2\u03c6 0\n0 0 0 cosh 2\u03c6 \u22121 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (9)\nWe now write down the moving frame equations for F . A straightforward computation\nusing (9) shows that if \u03b1 = (\u2202f2, N), then the moving frame equations for F may be\nwritten in terms of \u03c9, \u03c6, \u03b1 as follows:\n\u2202f0 = f1,\n\u2202f1 = f2 + \u2202\u03c9 f1,\n\u2202f\u00af1 = \u2212e\u03c9f0,\n\u2202f2 = e\n\u2212\u03c9f\u00af1 + 2\u2202\u03c6 coth 2\u03c6 f2 + 2\u2202\u03c6 csch 2\u03c6 f\u00af2 + \u03b1N,\n\u2202f\u00af2 = \u2212e\u2212\u03c9 cosh 2\u03c6 f\u00af1,\n\u2202N = \u2212\u03b1 csch2 2\u03c6 (f2 + cosh 2\u03c6 f\u00af2).\nOf course, the corresponding \u2202\u00af equations may be found by taking the conjugates of the\nabove. It follows from uniqueness of solutions of linear differential equations and the inte-\ngrability conditions \u2202\u2202\u00afF = \u2202\u00af\u2202F that a minimal surface with non-circular non-degenerate\n3\nellipse of curvature in S5(1) is determined, up to O(6)-congruence, by functions \u03c9, \u03c6 > 0,\n\u03b1 satisfying the following system of differential equations:\n\u2202\u00af\u03b1 = \u22122\u03b1\u00af\u2202\u03c6 csch 2\u03c6,\n\u2202\u00af\u2202\u03c9 = \u2212e\u03c9 + e\u2212\u03c9 cosh 2\u03c6,\n2\u2202\u00af\u2202\u03c6 = \u03b1\u03b1\u00af csch 2\u03c6\u2212 e\u2212\u03c9 sinh 2\u03c6.\n(10)\nThe functions \u03b1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 have geometrical significance: \u03b1 is analogous to the torsion of a\nspace curve in that it is a measure of the rate at which the surface is pulling away from the\ngreat 4-sphere which contains its tangent and first normal space, the metric on the surface\nis given by 2e\u03c9|dz|2, and \u03c6 is a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse of curvature.\nRemark 1 The above equation for \u03c6 may be used to show that every compact minimal\nsurface S in S4(1) contains at least one point at which the ellipse of curvature is a point, a\nline segment or a circle. Otherwise, \u03c6 would be a smooth globally defined positive function\non S satisfying the two-dimensional sinh-Gordon equation.\n3 The transforms\nIn this section we assume that f : S \u2192 S5(1) is a minimal immersion with non-circular\nellipse of curvature at every point. We show how to associate to f two other minimal\nimmersions of the Riemann surface S into S5(1) which both induce the same conformal\nstrucure on S as that induced by f , and also have non-circular ellipse of curvature at\nevery point. We further show that an adapted complex coordinate z for f is also an\nadapted complex coordinate for our new minimal immersions. We first consider the open\nsubset of S on which the ellipse of curvature is non-degenerate. Then, as mentioned in the\nintroduction, our new minimal immersions are obtained by rotating N in the normal space\nthrough a geometrically significant angle \u03b8 about the minor axis of the ellipse of curvature.\nSo, let z be an adapted complex coordinate for f and let cos \u03b8 = |a|\/|b| = tanh\u03c6. Then,\napplying rotations of \u00b1\u03b8 to \u00b1N gives the four possibilities\n\u00b1 1\ncosh\u03c6\nb\n|b| \u00b1 tanh\u03c6N.\nFor definiteness, we take N to be such that {f0, \u2202f0\u2202x , \u2202f0\u2202y , II(\u2202f0\u2202x , \u2202f0\u2202x ), II(\u2202f0\u2202x , \u2202f0\u2202y ), N}\nis a positively oriented orthogonal moving frame of R6, and the two transforms we will\nconsider are those given by\nf+ = \u2212 1\ncosh\u03c6\nb\n|b| + tanh\u03c6N, (11)\nf\u2212 = \u2212 1\ncosh\u03c6\nb\n|b| \u2212 tanh\u03c6N. (12)\nThus if we orient the normal space by taking {II(\u2202f0\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f0\n\u2202x\n), II(\u2202f0\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f0\n\u2202y\n), N} to be posi-\ntively oriented, then the (+)transform f+ is obtained from f by the (+)construction which\n4\nis given by (11) and consists of rotating N about the minor axis of the ellipse of curvature\nthrough the angle \u03b8 anticlockwise, while the (\u2212)transform f\u2212 is obtained from f by the\n(\u2212)construction which is given by (12) and consists of rotating \u2212N about the minor axis\nthrough the angle \u03b8 clockwise.\nWe note that b = 1\n2\nII(\u2202f\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f\n\u2202y\n) is a nowhere zero vector, so the orientation of S induces\nan orthogonal complex structure J on the orthogonal complement of {f, \u2202f\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f\n\u2202y\n, b} in R6.\nAn alternative description of f \u000f is then given by\nf \u000f = \u2212 1|b|\n(\nb\n|b| + \u000fJ II(\n\u2202f\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f\n\u2202x\n)\n)\n.\nThis description is valid and differentiable at points where the ellipse of curvature degen-\nerates to a line segment, and hence we may define our transforms at these points also. We\nnote that f(S) is contained in a totally geodesic S3(1) in S5(1) if and only if it is totally\ngeodesic or the ellipse of curvature degenerates to a line segment on the complement of an\nisolated set of points (where the second fundamental form may vanish), and in this latter\ncase the transforms simply give the unit normal of f(S) in S3(1). From now on, we assume\nthat we are not in this situation, so that the ellipse of curvature is non-degenerate on an\nopen dense subset of S.\nWe note the following for later use. Let vol denote the complexification of the standard\nvolume form of R6. Since detA = e2\u03c9 sinh2 2\u03c6, we see that vol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2, N) =\n\u00b1e\u03c9 sinh 2\u03c6. However,\nvol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2, N) = \u221214vol\n(\nf0,\n\u2202f0\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f0\n\u2202y\n, II(\u2202f0\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f0\n\u2202x\n), II(\u2202f0\n\u2202x\n, \u2202f0\n\u2202y\n), N\n)\n,\nso that\nvol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2, N) = \u2212e\u03c9 sinh 2\u03c6. (13)\nWe now show that f+ and f\u2212 both induce the same conformal structure on S as that\ninduced by f . In order to do this, we first define\nf \u000f1 = \u2202f\n\u000f.\nHere and subsequently, we use \u000f as a superscript taking value + or \u2212, and use \u000f = \u00b11 in\nthe corresponding equations as appropriate. Then, using (11), (12) and the moving frame\nequations for F , we find that\nf \u000f1 = \u2212ie\u2212\u03c9f\u00af1 \u2212 12(\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6) sech2\u03c6\n(\ncsch 2\u03c6 f2 + coth 2\u03c6 f\u00af2 + \u000fiN\n)\n. (14)\nFrom this, a computation using (9) shows that\n(f \u000f1, f\n\u000f\n1) = 0, (15)\n|f \u000f1|2 = e\u2212\u03c9 + 12 |\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2 sech2\u03c6. (16)\nThus the maps f \u000f define conformal immersions of S into S5(1), so that if z = x+ iy then\n(x, y) are isothermal coordinates not only for the original immersion f but also for the two\n5\nnewly constructed immersions f \u000f. We note that the metric induced on S by f \u000f is given by\n2e\u03c9\n\u000f |dz2|, where \u03c9\u000f = log |f \u000f1|2.\nWe now show that each f \u000f is minimal. By Takahashi\u2019s lemma, it is sufficient to check\nthat \u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f is a multiple of f \u000f. We first note that it follows quickly from (14) that\n(\u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f, f0) = 0,\n(\u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f, f1) = 0,\nwhile a straightforward computer calculation shows that\n(\u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f, f2) = \u2212i(e\u2212\u03c9 + 12 |\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2 sech2\u03c6),\n(\u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f, N) = \u2212\u000f tanh\u03c6 (e\u2212\u03c9 + 1\n2\n|\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2 sech2\u03c6).\nHowever, it follows from (7), (9), (11) and (12) that\n(f \u000f, f0) = 0, (17)\n(f \u000f, f1) = 0, (18)\n(f \u000f, f2) = i, (19)\n(f \u000f, N) = \u000f tanh\u03c6, (20)\nand hence, using (16),\n\u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f = \u2212|f \u000f1|2f \u000f,\nshowing that \u2202\u2202\u00aff \u000f is indeed a multiple of f \u000f, so that each f \u000f is a minimal immersion of S\ninto S5(1).\nFinally in this section, we show that z is also an adapted complex coordinate for f \u000f. If\nII\u000f denotes the second fundamental form of f \u000f, we put\nf \u000f2 = II\n\u000f(\u2202, \u2202) = a\u000f \u2212 ib\u000f.\nAs in the moving frame equations for F , if \u03c9\u000f = log |f \u000f1|2, then\nf \u000f2 = \u2202f\n\u000f\n1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c9\u000ff \u000f1. (21)\nIt follows from (11), (12) and the moving frame equations for F that\n\u2202f \u000f1 = if0 + e\n\u2212\u03c9\n(\ni\u2202\u03c9 + tanh\u03c6 (\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6)\n)\nf\u00af1 + 2\u03bd csch\n42\u03c6 sinh2\u03c6 f2\n+ (1\/2)\u03bd coth 2\u03c6 csch 2\u03c6 sech2\u03c6 f\u00af2 + i\u000f\u03bd csch\n2 2\u03c6 tanh\u03c6 N,\n(22)\nwhere\n\u03bd = 2\u03b1\u000f\u2202\u03c6(\u22122 + cosh 2\u03c6) + 8i sinh2\u03c6 (\u2202\u03c6)2\n\u2212 \u000f\u2202\u03b1 sinh 2\u03c6+ i\u03b12 \u2212 2i sinh 2\u03c6 \u2202\u2202\u03c6,\nso that, using (9),\n(\u2202f \u000f1, \u2202f\n\u000f\n1) = \u22121.\nEquations (15) and (21) now imply that (f \u000f2, f\n\u000f\n2) = \u22121, so that z is also an adapted complex\ncoordinate for each f \u000f. In particular, each f \u000f has non-circular ellipse of curvature.\nSummarizing the above, we have the following theorem:\n6\nTheorem 1 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion with non-circular ellipse of\ncurvature at every point. Then the (+)transform f+ and the (\u2212)transform f\u2212 of f are\nboth minimal immersions of S into S5(1) which induce the same conformal structure on S\nas that induced by f . Moreover, both f+ and f\u2212 have non-circular ellipse of curvature at\nevery point and an adapted complex coordinate for f is also an adapted complex coordinate\nfor f+ and f\u2212.\nRemark 2 The final statement of the above theorem is equivalent to saying that f , f+\nand f\u2212 all have the same U2,\u22122 invariant (see [5] for the definition of this and related\ninvariants).\n4 A symmetric adapted moving frame\nIn this section we assume that f has non-circular ellipse of curvature at each point and is\nnot contained in a totally geodesic S3(1). We begin the study of f and its transforms by\nconstructing a moving frame B which gives equal prominence to f and f \u000f. We also obtain\nthe moving frame equations and integrability conditions for B.\nSo, let B = {f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f \u000f1, f \u000f0}. It follows quickly from (9) and the moving frame\nequations for F that the matrix B of complex bilinear inner products of elements of B is\ngiven by\nB =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 e\u03c9 0 \u2212i 0\n0 e\u03c9 0 i 0 0\n0 0 i 0 e\u03c9\n\u000f\n0\n0 \u2212i 0 e\u03c9\u000f 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (23)\nfrom which we see that\ndetB = (e\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f \u2212 1)2, (24)\nimplying that the vectors in B are linearly independent as long as \u03c9 + \u03c9\u000f 6= 0.\nLemma 1 We have that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u000f > 0 on an open dense subset U of S.\nProof: It follows from (16) that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u000f \u2265 0, and that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u000f = 0 on an open set if and\nonly if \u03b1 = \u22122i\u000f\u2202\u03c6. Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to \u2202\u00af and using\nthe integrability conditions (10) for the moving frame equations for F it then follows that\n\u22124i\u000f csch 2\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6\u2202\u00af\u03c6 = e\u2212\u03c9i\u000f csch 2\u03c6 (sinh22\u03c6\u2212 4e\u03c9\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u00af\u03c6).\nSimplifying the above equation then yields the contradiction 0 = e\u2212\u03c9 sinh 2\u03c6.\nThe advantage of the above condition is that on the open dense subset U we can\ninvestigate the original immersion f and the new immersion f \u000f with respect to the frame\nB = {f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f \u000f1, f \u000f0}.\n7\nIt follows from (24) that vol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n0) = \u00b1(e\u03c9+\u03c9\u000f \u2212 1). In order to determine\nthe sign we compute the volume explicitly. A straightforward calculation using (13) and\n(14) yields that\nvol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f) = \u000f csch22\u03c6 tanh\u03c6 |\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2vol (f0, f1, f\u00af1, f2, f\u00af2, N)\n= \u2212\u000fe\u03c9 csch 2\u03c6 tanh\u03c6 |\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2\n= \u2212\u000f1\n2\nsech2\u03c6 e\u03c9|\u03b1\u000f+ 2i\u2202\u03c6|2.\nThus, using (16),\nvol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n0) = \u2212\u000f(e\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f \u2212 1). (25)\nWe now intoduce the function \u03b3\u000f by\n\u03b3\u000f = (\u2202f1, f\n\u000f\n1), (26)\nand use (23) to write down the moving frame equations for B in terms of \u03c9, \u03c9\u000f, \u03b3\u000f as\nfollows.\n\u2202f0 = f1,\n\u2202f1 =\n\u2212i\u03b3\u000f+\u2202\u03c9e\u03c9+\u03c9\u000f\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121 f1 +\ne\u03c9(\u03b3\u000f+i\u2202\u03c9)\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121 f\u00af\n\u000f\n1 + if\n\u000f\n0,\n\u2202f\u00af1 = \u2212e\u03c9f0,\n\u2202f\u00af \u000f1 = \u2212e\u03c9\n\u000f\nf \u000f0,\n\u2202f \u000f1 = if0 \u2212 e\n\u03c9\u000f (\u03b3\u000f\u2212i\u2202\u03c9\u000f)\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121 f\u00af1 +\ni\u03b3\u000f+\u2202\u03c9\u000fe\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121 f\n\u000f\n1,\n\u2202f \u000f0 = f\n\u000f\n1.\nAs before, the corresponding \u2202\u00af equations may be found by taking the conjugates of the\nabove. The integrability conditions of the above system of equations are\n\u2202\u00af\u03b3\u000f = i(e\u03c9 \u2212 e\u03c9\u000f),\n\u2202\u2202\u00af\u03c9 = \u22122 sinh\u03c9 + 1\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\u000f\u22121 |\u03b3\u000f + i\u2202\u03c9|2,\n\u2202\u2202\u00af\u03c9\u000f = \u22122 sinh\u03c9\u000f + 1\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121 |\u03b3\u000f \u2212 i\u2202\u03c9\u000f|2.\n(27)\nAs before, solutions of (27) correspond up to O(6) congruence to a minimal surface and\nits \u000f-transform.\n5 The (+) and (\u2212) constructions are mutual inverses\nIn this section we use the frame B introduced in the previous section to prove the following.\nTheorem 2 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion with non-circular ellipse of\ncurvature at every point. Then the (+)construction and the (\u2212)construction are mu-\ntual inverses in the sense that both f+ and f\u2212 have non-circular ellipse of curvature and\n(f+)\u2212 = (f\u2212)+ = f .\n8\nProof: The theorem is clearly true if f(S) is contained in a totally geodesic S3(1), so we\nassume otherwise and work on the open dense subset U of S on which \u03c9 + \u03c9+ > 0. We\ndenote by p\u000f\u02dc(f\n\u000f\n0), where \u000f\u02dc\u000f = \u22121, the image of f \u000f0 by the \u000f\u02dc construction. So, by (11) and\n(12), we have that\np\u000f\u02dc(f\n\u000f\n0) = \u2212 1cosh\u03c6\u000f b\n\u000f\n|b\u000f| + \u000f\u02dc tanh\u03c6\n\u000fN \u000f = \u2212 b\u000f\ncosh2\u03c6\u000f\n+ \u000f\u02dc tanh\u03c6\u000fN \u000f. (28)\nNow let\nv = b\n\u000f\ncosh2\u03c6\u000f\n+ f0.\nIt follows from the \u000f-analogue of (9) and from (23) that v is orthogonal to f \u000f0 and f\n\u000f\n1, while,\nusing the \u000f-analogues of (6) and (7), we see that\n(v, f \u000f2) = (\nb\u000f\ncosh2 \u03c6\u000f\n, f \u000f2) + (f0, f\n\u000f\n2)\n= \u2212i |b\u000f|2\ncosh2 \u03c6\u000f\n+ (f0, \u2202f\n\u000f\n1)\n= \u2212i\u2212 (\u2202f0, f \u000f1)\n= \u2212i\u2212 (f1, f \u000f1)\n= \u2212i+ i = 0,\nso that v is a scalar multiple of N \u000f. We now use the moving frame equations for B to\ndetermine this scalar multiple as follows. First note that\nvol(f \u000f0, f\n\u000f\n1, f\u00af\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n2, f\u00af\n\u000f\n2, v) = vol(f\n\u000f\n0, f\n\u000f\n1, f\u00af\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n2, f\u00af\n\u000f\n2, f0)\n= vol(f \u000f0, f\n\u000f\n1, f\u00af\n\u000f\n1, \u2202f\n\u000f\n1, \u2202\u00aff\u00af\n\u000f\n1, f0)\n= \u2212 e2\u03c9\u000f\n(e\u03c9+\u03c9\n\u000f\u22121)2 |\u03b3\u000f \u2212 i\u2202\u03c9\u000f|2vol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, f\u00af \u000f1, f \u000f1, f \u000f)\n= \u000f e\n2\u03c9\u000f\n(e\u03c9+\u03c9\u000f\u22121) |\u03b3\u000f \u2212 i\u2202\u03c9\u000f|2,\nwhere the final equality above is obtained using (25).\nHowever, it follows from (27) and the \u000f-analogue of (10) that\ne\u03c9\n\u000f\n(e\u03c9+\u03c9\u000f\u22121) |\u03b3\u000f \u2212 i\u2202\u03c9\u000f|2 = 2 sinh2\u03c6\u000f, (29)\nso that\nvol(f \u000f0, f\n\u000f\n1, f\u00af\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n2, f\u00af\n\u000f\n2, v) = 2\u000fe\n\u03c9\u000f sinh2\u03c6\u000f.\nWe next note that the \u000f-analogue of (13) gives\nvol(f \u000f0, f\n\u000f\n1, f\u00af\n\u000f\n1, f\n\u000f\n2, f\u00af\n\u000f\n2, N\n\u000f) = \u2212e\u03c9\u000f sinh 2\u03c6\u000f,\nso it follows that v = \u2212\u000f tanh\u03c6\u000fN \u000f.\nThus, from (24) we have that\np\u000f\u02dc(f\n\u000f\n0) = \u2212v + f0 + \u000f\u02dc tanh\u03c6\u000fN \u000f\n= (\u000f\u02dc+ \u000f) tanh\u03c6\u000fN \u000f + f0 = f0,\n9\nimplying that the (+)construction and the (\u2212)construction are mutual inverses.\nThe above theorem shows that we may associate to a minimal immersion f : S \u2192 S5(1)\nwith non-circular ellipse of curvature a sequence {fp : p \u2208 Z} of such minimal immersions\nwith f 0 = f and, for each p, fp+1 = (fp)+ and fp\u22121 = (fp)\u2212. Moreover, each element of the\nsequence induces the same conformal structure on S, and an adapted complex coordinate\nz for any fp is an adapted complex coordinate for each element of the sequence.\n6 The geometry of the invariants\nIn the previous section we showed that we may associate to a minimal immersion f :\nS \u2192 S5(1) with non-circular ellipse of curvature a sequence {fp : p \u2208 Z} of such minimal\nimmersions with f 0 = f . For the remainder of the paper we will assume that f(S) is not\ncontained in a totally geodesic S3(1). We use the superfix p to denote objects connected\nwith fp. For instance, with each immersion fp we associate as before the invariants \u03c9p, \u03c6p\nand \u03b1p. Moreover with each (+)construction, fp \u2192 fp+1, we associate the invariants \u03c9p,\n\u03c9p+1 and \u03b3p+1 = (\u2202fp1 , f\np+1\n1 ), while with each (\u2212)construction we associate the invariants\n\u03c9p, \u03c9p\u22121 and \u03b4p\u22121 = (\u2202fp1 , f\np\u22121\n1 ). Thus, \u03b3\n1 is equal to the invariant \u03b3+ used in previous\nsections, while \u03b4\u22121 is equal to \u03b3\u2212. Since, from (23), we have that (fp1 , f\np+1\n1 ) = \u2212i, it is\nclear that \u03b4p = \u2212\u03b3p+1.\nAs already mentioned, the geometrical meaning of the invariants \u03c9p is clear, since they\ngive the metric induced on S by fp. Also, the final moving frame equation for F implies\nthat \u03b1p = 0 if and only if fp is not linearly full. In this section we look more closely at\nthis situation, and also obtain a geometrical characterisation of the condition \u03b3p+1 = 0.\nWe begin with a useful lemma.\nLemma 2 Let A be an orientation reversing isometry of R6. Then\n(Af)\u2212 = A(f+) , (Af)+ = A(f\u2212) .\nIn fact, more generally, for each integer p we have that (Af)p = A(f\u2212p).\nProof: As A is an orientation reversing isometry, if N is the normal vector associated to\nf as in equations (11) and (12), then the corresponding normal associated to Af is \u2212AN .\nThe first result is now clear from the definitions of the (+) and (\u2212)constructions given in\n(11) and (12). The second may be proved in a similar manner, and the final statement\nfollows by induction.\nTheorem 3 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion, not contained in a totally geodesic\nS3(1), with non-circular ellipse of curvature at every point. Let {fp} be the sequence of\nminimal immersions into S5(1) determined by f . For each integer q, the following three\nstatements are equivalent:\n1. \u03b1q = 0 on an open subset of S,\n10\n2. f q is not linearly full,\n3. there exists an orientation reversing isometry A \u2208 O(6) such that f q+1 = A(f q\u22121).\nMoreover, in this case, for every integer r we have that f q\u2212r and f q+r are congruent via\nreflection in the great 4-sphere containing f q.\nProof: We have already noted the equivalence of the first two statements. Now suppose\nthat condition 3 holds. Taking the (\u2212)construction of this, we may use Lemma 2 to see\nthat f q = A(f q). Since A has at least one eigenvalue equal to \u22121, it now follows that f q\nis not linearly full and that A is reflection in the great 4-sphere containing f q.\nConversely suppose that f q is contained is a totally geodesic S4(1). In this case N q is\na constant vector, so it is clear from (11) and (12) that f q\u22121 and f q+1 are congruent via\nreflection in the totally geodesic S4(1) containing f q. The final statement of the theorem\nnow follows from Lemma 2.\nA similar characterisation also exists for \u03b3q+1 = 0. We show in Section 9 that this\nsituation can actually arise; in this case f q is a bipolar surface in the sense of Lawson [10].\nTheorem 4 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion, not contained in a totally geodesic\nS3(1), with non-circular ellipse of curvature at every point. Let {fp} be the sequence of\nminimal immersions into S5(1) determined by f . For each integer q, \u03b3q+1 = 0 if and\nonly if there exists an orientation reversing isometry A \u2208 O(6) such that f q+1 = A(f q).\nMoreover, in this case, A is reflection in a great subsphere of S5(1) and for every integer\nr we have that f q+1+r = A(f q\u2212r).\nProof: Assume that f q+1 = A(f q). Then,\n\u03b3q+1 = (\u2202f q1 , f\nq+1\n1 )\n= (\u2202A(f q1 ), A(f\nq+1\n1 )).\nHowever,\nA(f q1 ) = A\u2202f\nq = \u2202A(f q) = \u2202f q+1 = f q+11 ,\nwhile, using Lemma 2,\nA(f q+11 ) = A(\u2202f\nq+1) = \u2202A(f q+1) = \u2202((A(f q))\u2212) = \u2202((f q+1)\u2212) = \u2202f q = f q1 .\nThus\n\u03b3q+1 = (\u2202f q+11 , f\nq\n1 ) = \u2212(f q+11 , \u2202f q1 ) = \u2212\u03b3q+1,\nso that \u03b3q+1 = 0.\nConversely suppose that \u03b3q+1 = 0. It then follows from the integrability conditions\n(27) that \u03c9q = \u03c9q+1. Since the set B is a basis for C6 we may define, for each z, a unique\nlinear map A(z) by\nAf q0 = f\nq+1\n0 , Af\nq\n1 = f\nq+1\n1 , Af\u00af\nq\n1 = f\u00af\nq+1\n1 ,\nAf q+10 = f\nq\n0 , Af\nq+1\n1 = f\nq\n1 , Af\u00af\nq+1\n1 = f\u00af\nq\n1 .\n11\nHowever, it follows from the moving frame equations for B that A does not depend on z,\nwhile (23) may be used to show that A is an isometry. It is clear from the definition that\nA has determinant \u22121 and A2 is the identity, so it follows that A is a reflection. As in the\nprevious theorem, the final statement follows from Lemma 2.\nIn the previous two theorems we have considered two situations which led to the con-\nclusion that two elements in a sequence {fp} are congruent via an orientation reversing\nisometry. An easy application of Lemma 2 quickly leads to the following theorem, which\nshows that the above situations are the only ones for which this can happen.\nTheorem 5 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion, not contained in a totally geodesic\nS3(1), with non-circular ellipse of curvature at every point. Let {fp} be the sequence of\nminimal immersions into S5(1) determined by f . Suppose that two elements f q and f r\nof the sequence are congruent via an orientation reversing isometry. Then there are two\npossibilities, depending on the parity of q \u2212 r. Either\n1. there exists an integer s for which \u03b1s = 0 on an open subset of S, or\n2. there exists an integer s for which \u03b3s+1 = 0.\nFinally in this section, we note that if two elements of a sequence {fp} are related by\nan orientation preserving isometry then the sequence is periodic in a natural sense. This\nsituation can actually arise, and we plan to investigate this further at a later date.\n7 Minimal surfaces and ruled Lagrangian submani-\nfolds\nIn a previous paper [3], we studied minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of complex projective\n3-space CP 3(4) which admit a foliation by asymptotic curves. Such submanifolds can be\ndivided in to three types.\n1. Those which additionally satisfy Chen\u2019s equality [8]. These were studied and charac-\nterized in [1], [2], and are closely related to minimal immersions of surfaces in S5(1)\nwith ellipse of curvature a circle.\n2. Those for which the unit tangent vectors to the asymptotic curves form a Killing\nvector field. It is shown in [3] that these are related to minimal surfaces in S3(1),\nand classification theorems are obtained in [7].\n3. All the rest. In [3] we showed how to construct, starting from such a submanifold,\na pair of minimal immersions of a surface S into S5(1) with non-circular ellipse of\ncurvature which are related by the (+) and (\u2212)constructions.\n12\nIn this section we deal with the converse of the construction described in [3]. We show\nhow to associate to a minimal immersion f of a surface in S5(1) with non-circular ellipse\nof curvature a Lagrangian submanifold of CP 3(4) belonging to the third type. We will\nthen show that the construction given in [3] associates to this Lagrangian submanifold\nthe immersion f and its (+)transform. We first briefly describe the construction given\nin [3]. Let M be a minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of CP 3(4) which admits a foliation\nby asymptotic curves. We construct an orthonormal moving frame {e1, e2, e3} along M\nsuch that e1 is tangential to the asymptotic curves and e2, e3 are eigenvectors of the second\nfundamental form AJe1 ofM with respect to the normal Je1 with corresponding eigenvalues\n\u00b1\u03bb (\u03bb > 0). Since M is Lagrangian in CP 3(4), there is a horizontal lift E0 : M \u2192 S7(1)\nof M to the unit 7-sphere of the Hopf fibration pi : S7(1) \u2192 CP 3(4) [11]. By setting\nEj = dE0(ej) for j = 1, 2, 3, we then define a map E = (E0, . . . ,E3) : M \u2192 U(4),\nwhere U(4) denotes the unitary group, but, by choosing a suitable horizontal lift, we may\nassume that the image of E is contained in the special unitary group SU(4). Composing\nE with a suitable standard double cover of the orthogonal group SO(6) by SU(4) gives a\nmap U = (U1, . . . ,U6) : M \u2192 SO(6). It turns out that U2 and U4 are constant along\nthe asymptotic curves of M , and their images are minimal surfaces in S5(1). If M is a\nLagrangian submanifold of the third type mentioned at the beginning of this section, then\nit is shown in [3] that the ellipse of curvature of these surfaces is not a circle, and the\nsurfaces are related by the transforms discussed in the current paper.\nWe will use the notation and terminology of [3], and work throughout on the open\nsubset U of S on which \u03c9 + \u03c9+ > 0. In order to simplify the notation, we denote the\nimmersion of S into S5(1) by f and let g be the (+)transform of f . As usual, we let z be\nan adapted complex coordinate, put f0 = f , f1 = \u2202f , g0 = g and g1 = \u2202g.\nWe will show that, for a suitable interval I of real numbers, M = I\u00d7U may be realised\nas a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of CP 3(4) of type 3 such that if {e1, e2, e3} is an\northonormal frame alongM of the type described above and in [3], then the corresponding\nmap U = (U1, . . . ,U6) :M \u2192 SO(6) has\nU2(t, z) = g0(z), U4(t, z) = f0(z), (30)\nwhere t is the standard real coordinate on I.\nIn fact, we use the invariants \u03c9, \u03c9+ and \u03b3+ to construct a map U = (U1, . . . ,U6) :\nM \u2192 SO(6) satisfying (30), with the property that if \u2126 = U\u22121dU then \u2126 has the form of\n(33) of [3] for suitable functions z221, z\n3\n12, z\n3\n22, z\n3\n32, \u03bb, a and b onM , and linearly independent\n1-forms \u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93 on M . Having done this, it is straightforward to deduce that we may\nreverse the construction given in [3] in order to construct from such a map U our required\nLagrangian submanifold of CP 3(4), with the orthonormal basis {e1, e2, e3} being the basis\nof vectors dual to {\u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93}.\nWe begin by noting from (42) of [3] that in order for (30) to hold we require that\ndU2(e2 \u2212 ie3) = 2\u03b81\n\u221a\n\u03bb g1, (31)\n13\nwhere \u03b81 is a fourth root of unity. In fact, we may assume that \u03b81 = 1 by rotating our\nadapted complex coordinate z through a suitable multiple of pi\/2. In a similar manner,\ndU4(e2 \u2212 ie3) = 2\u03b82\n\u221a\n\u03bb f1, (32)\nfor some fourth root of unity \u03b82.\nWe next note that for (34) and (35) of [3] to hold we must have that\ndU2(e2 \u2212 ie3) = (z312 \u2212 1\u2212 iz221)(U1 + iU3)\u2212 \u03bb(U5 + iU6),\nand\ndU4(e2 \u2212 ie3) = i\u03bb(U1 \u2212 iU3) + i(1 + z312 \u2212 iz221)(U5 \u2212 iU6),\nso that, from (31) and (32),\n2\n\u221a\n\u03bb g1 = (z\n3\n12 \u2212 1\u2212 iz221)(U1 + iU3)\u2212 \u03bb(U5 + iU6), (33)\n2\u03b82\n\u221a\n\u03bb f1 = i\u03bb(U1 \u2212 iU3) + i(1 + z312 \u2212 iz221)(U5 \u2212 iU6). (34)\nHowever, it follows from (23) that \u2212i = (f1, g1), so orthonormality of U requires that\n\u22124\u03b82\u03bbi = 2i\u03bb(z312 \u2212 1\u2212 iz221)\u2212 2i\u03bb(1 + z312 \u2212 iz221)\n= \u22124i\u03bb,\nso that \u03b82 = 1. Therefore, in order to construct U , it is necessary to determine real-\nvalued functions z312(t, z), z\n2\n21(t, z), \u03bb(t, z), and orthonormal vector fields U1(t, z), U3(t, z),\nU5(t, z), U6(t, z) in R6 satisfying (33) and (34) (with \u03b82 = 1 in this latter equation).\nHowever, as (f1, f\u00af1) = e\n\u03c9 and (g1, g\u00af1) = e\n\u03c9+ we see that\n2\u03bbe\u03c9\n+\n= (z312 \u2212 1)2 + (z221)2 + \u03bb2,\n2\u03bbe\u03c9 = (1 + z312)\n2 + (z221)\n2 + \u03bb2.\nThus\nz312 =\n1\n2\n\u03bb(e\u03c9 \u2212 e\u03c9+), (35)\nand\n(z221)\n2 +\n(\n1\u2212 1\n2\n\u03bb(e\u03c9 + e\u03c9\n+\n)\n)2\n= \u03bb2(e\u03c9+\u03c9\n+ \u2212 1).\nAs \u03bb and (e\u03c9+\u03c9\n+ \u2212 1) are both positive, we may define z221 and \u03bb by taking\n\u03bb = 2\ne\u03c9+e\u03c9\n+\n+2 cos t\n\u221a\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n+\u22121\n, (36)\nz221 = \u03bb sin t\n\u221a\ne\u03c9+\u03c9+ \u2212 1. (37)\nWe restrict t to lie on a suitable subinterval I of (0, pi), in order to ensure that \u03bb is well\ndefined and z221 > 0.\n14\nWe have now obtained, through (35), (36) and (37), formulae for z312, \u03bb and z\n2\n21 in terms\nof \u03c9, \u03c9+ and \u03b3+. We next obtain U1, U3, U5 and U6 as the solutions to (33) and (34).\nIn the next section we will discuss a particular special case of the construction detailed in\nthis section, so we will write down the solution to (33) and (34) and verify their properties\nexplicitly (for which we used Mathematica), although the properties we obtain may be\ndeduced directly from (33) and (34).\nSo, if\nC =\n\u221a\n\u03bb\ne\u03c9+\u03c9+\u22121 ,\nwe find from (33) and (34) that\nU1 + iU3 = \u2212C\n(\n(\n\u221a\ne\u03c9+\u03c9+ \u2212 1 + e\u2212it+\u03c9)g1 + ie\u2212itf\u00af1\n)\n, (38)\nU5 + iU6 = C\n(\ne\u2212itg1 + i(\n\u221a\ne\u03c9+\u03c9+ \u2212 1 + e\u2212it+\u03c9+)f\u00af1\n)\n. (39)\nIt is now a straightforward computation using (23) to verify that U1 up to U6 defined by\n(30),(38) and (39) are orthonormal vectors and that, using (25),\nvol(U1, . . . ,U6) = \u2212 1e\u03c9+\u03c9+\u22121vol(f0, f1, f\u00af1, g\u00af1, g1, g0)\n= 1.\nThus U = (U1, . . . ,U6) : M \u2192 SO(6), so that \u2126 = U\u22121dU is a skew symmetric matrix\nwhose second and fourth columns have the correct form.\nIt remains to find the linearly independent 1-forms \u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93 on M , and real valued\nfunctions z322, z\n3\n32, a and b on M such that the entries of \u2126 = U\u22121dU are as given in (33)\nof [3].\nSince dU2(\u2202\/\u2202t) = 0, for (33) of [3] to hold we need that \u03c92(\u2202\/\u2202t) = \u03c93(\u2202\/\u2202t) = 0.\nAlso, from (31) with \u03b81 = 1, we have\ndU2(e2) =\n\u221a\n\u03bb dg(\u2202\/\u2202x) =\n\u221a\n\u03bb dU2(\u2202\/\u2202x),\ndU2(e3) =\n\u221a\n\u03bb dg(\u2202\/\u2202y) =\n\u221a\n\u03bb dU2(\u2202\/\u2202y),\nfrom which it follows that e2 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03bb \u2202\/\u2202x and e3 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03bb \u2202\/\u2202y are multiples of \u2202\/\u2202t. Thus\n\u03c92 =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ndx, \u03c93 =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ndy, (40)\nwhich also ensures that (34) holds with \u03b82 = 1.\nWe now consider the columns of \u2126 other than the second and fourth. These have the\ncorrect form if and only if we have that, modulo U2 and U4,\nd(U1 + iU3) \u2261 i\n(\n(1 + z312)\u03c91 + z\n3\n22\u03c92 + z\n3\n32\u03c93\n)\n(U1 + iU3)\n+ (c\u03bb\u2212\n1\n2dz \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c91)(U5 + iU6), (mod U2,U4),\n(41)\nd(U5 + iU6) \u2261 \u2212(c\u00af\u03bb\u2212\n1\n2dz\u00af + i\u03bb\u03c91)(U1 + iU3)\n\u2212 i ((z312 \u2212 1)\u03c91 + z322\u03c92 + z332\u03c93) (U5 + iU6), (mod U2,U4), (42)\n15\nwhere c = \u2212b\u2212 ia. In particular, \u03c91 must satisfy(\nd(U1 + iU3),U1 \u2212 iU3\n)\n+\n(\nd(U5 + iU6),U5 \u2212 iU6\n)\n= 4i\u03c91. (43)\nComputing the lefthand side explicitly using (38) and (39), we see that (43) holds if and\nonly if\n\u03c91(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n) = \u22121\n2\n, (44)\n\u03c91(\u2202\u00af) = \u221214i2i \u03b3\n++e\u03c9+\u03c9\n+\n\u2202\u00af(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9+)\ne\u03c9+\u03c9+\u22121 . (45)\nWe use these expressions to define \u03c91, in which case (40), implies that \u03c91, \u03c92 and \u03c93 are\nlinearly independent 1-forms on M .\nA straightforward computation using (38) and (39) now shows that(\nd(U1 + iU3),U5 \u2212 iU6\n)\n( \u2202\n\u2202t\n) = i\u03bb,(\nd(U1 + iU3),U1 \u2212 iU3\n)\n( \u2202\n\u2202t\n)\u2212 (d(U5 + iU6),U5 \u2212 iU6)( \u2202\u2202t) + 2iz312 = 0,(\nd(U1 + iU3),U5 \u2212 iU6\n)\n(\u2202\u00af) = \u22121\n2\n\u03bb2i \u03b3\n++e\u03c9+\u03c9\n+\n\u2202\u00af(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9+)\ne\u03c9+\u03c9\n+\u22121 = \u22122i\u03bb\u03c91(\u2202\u00af),\nso it only remains to define the complex-valued function c on M and the real valued\nfunctions z322 and z\n3\n32 in such a way that (41) and (42) hold. This may be done explicitly\nand uniquely by calculating\n(\nd(U1 + iU3),U5 \u2212 iU6\n)\n(\u2202),\n(\nd(U1 + iU3),U1 \u2212 iU3\n)\n( \u2202\n\u2202x\n),\nand\n(\nd(U1 + iU3),U1 \u2212 iU3\n)\n( \u2202\n\u2202y\n). We have thus proved the following theorem.\nTheorem 6 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion, not contained in a totally geodesic\nS3(1), with non-circular ellipse of curvature at every point. Then there exists a minimal\nLagrangian submanifold of CP 3(4), admitting a foliation by asymptotic curves, for which\nthe construction described in [3] yields f and its (+)transform on an open dense set.\nWe remark that, since we have shown in the previous section that such minimal surfaces\nare part of a sequence, minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of type 3 also form a sequence.\nHowever, up to now, we do not know geometrically (without using this detour over minimal\nsurfaces) how to associate one with its successor.\nIn the next section we will give an example in which we can explicitly describe the\nreverse construction detailed in this section.\n8 Lawson\u2019s bipolar surfaces\nLet f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion with non-circular ellipse of curvature, which is\nnot contained in a totally geodesic S3(1). As usual, we will work on the open dense subset\nU of S on which \u03c9 + \u03c9+ is non-zero, and let z be an adapted complex coordinate for f .\nUsing the notation of the previous section, we will consider the special case in which the\ninvariant \u03b3+ = (\u2202f1, g1) is identically zero. We will show that, in this case, f is the bipolar\nsurface in the sense of Lawson [10] of a minimal surface in S3(1).\n16\nWe begin by noting that if \u03b3+ = 0 then (27) implies that \u03c9 = \u03c9+ while (27) and Lemma\n1 imply that \u03c9 is a positive solution of the following partial differential equation:\n\u2202\u2202\u00af\u03c9 = \u22122 sinh\u03c9 + 1\ne2\u03c9\u22121 |\u2202\u03c9|2. (46)\nConversely given a positive solution of the above differential equation, there exists a cor-\nresponding minimal surface in S5(1) with non-circular non-degenerate ellipse of curvature\nand induced metric 2e\u03c9|dz|2.\nIt is convenient to rewrite the above differential equation by making the substitution\ne\u03c9 = cosh \u03b7. A short calculation shows that \u03c9 satisfies (46) if and only if the function \u03b7\nsatisfies the sinh-Gordon equation\n\u2202\u2202\u00af\u03b7 = \u2212 sinh \u03b7. (47)\nWe recall [9] that a solution \u03b7 of the sinh-Gordon equation determines an S1-family of\nnon-totally geodesic minimal immersions in S3(1) whose induced metric is e\u03b7|dz|2, and we\nwill see that f is the bipolar in S5(1) of the minimal immersion in this family for which\nthe coordinate curves are the lines of curvature.\nSpecialising the formulae of the previous section to the case \u03b3+ = 0, we obtain\n\u03bb = 1\ncosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7\n,\nz221 =\nsin t sinh \u03b7\ncosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7\n,\nz312 = 0,\n\u03c91 = \u221212dt,\n\u03c92 =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ndx,\n\u03c93 =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ndy,\nb = 1\n2\n\u03bb3\/2\u03b7y sin t,\na = 1\n2\n\u03bb3\/2\u03b7x sin t,\nz332 =\n1\n2\n\u03bb3\/2\u03b7x(cos t cosh \u03b7 + sinh \u03b7),\nz322 = \u221212\u03bb3\/2\u03b7y(cos t cosh \u03b7 + sinh \u03b7).\n(48)\nIn particular, \u2202\/\u2202t = \u22121\n2\ne1, \u2202\/\u2202x =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ne2, and \u2202\/\u2202y =\n1\u221a\n\u03bb\ne3.\nSubstituting these expressions into (25) of [3] we see that the horizontal lift F to S7(1)\nof the minimal Lagrangian immersion into CP 3(4) corresponding to f satisfies the following\n17\nsystem of differential equations:\nFtt = \u2212F\/4, (49)\nFtx =\n\u2212(i+sin t sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFx, (50)\nFty =\ni\u2212sin t sinh \u03b7\n2(cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFy, (51)\nFxx = \u2212(cosh \u03b7 + cos t sinh \u03b7)F + 2(sin t sinh \u03b7 \u2212 i)Ft\n+ \u03b7x (cos t cosh \u03b7+i sin t+sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFx \u2212 \u03b7y (cos t cosh \u03b7\u2212i sin t+sinh \u03b7)2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7) Fy,\n(52)\nFxy =\n\u03b7y (cos t cosh \u03b7+i sin t+sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFx +\n\u03b7x (cos t cosh \u03b7\u2212i sin t+sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFy, (53)\nFyy = \u2212(cosh \u03b7 + cos t sinh \u03b7)F + 2(i+ sin t sinh \u03b7)Ft\n\u2212 \u03b7x (cos t cosh \u03b7+i sin t+sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFx +\n\u03b7y (cos t cosh \u03b7\u2212i sin t+sinh \u03b7)\n2 (cosh \u03b7+cos t sinh \u03b7)\nFy.\n(54)\nIt follows from (49) that we may write\nF (t, u, v) = G1(x, y) cos\nt\n2\n+ iG2(x, y) sin\nt\n2\n, (55)\nfor suitable C4-valued functions G1 and G2. Substituting this into (50) and carrying out\nsignificant but elementary simplification we find that\n(G2)x = \u2212e\u2212\u03b7(G1)x, (56)\nwhile similar reasoning using (51) gives that\n(G2)y = e\n\u2212\u03b7(G1)y. (57)\nUsing (56) and (57) we find, after some calculation, that (52), (53) and (54) are equivalent\nto\n(G1)xx =\n1\n2\n\u03b7x(G1)x \u2212 12\u03b7y(G1)y +G2 \u2212 e\u03b7G1,\n(G1)xy =\n1\n2\n\u03b7y(G1)x +\n1\n2\n\u03b7x(G1)y,\n(G1)yy = \u221212\u03b7x(G1)x + 12\u03b7y(G1)y \u2212G2 \u2212 e\u03b7G1.\n(58)\nWe now note that since |F | = 1, (55) implies that |G1| = |G2| = 1 and that G1 is\nreal orthogonal to G2. The horizontality of F further shows that G1 and G2 are unitarily\northogonal.\nThe coefficients in the system (58) are all real, so the real subspace spanned by G1, G2,\n(G1)x and (G1)y is constant. We identify this subspace with R4 by picking an orthonormal\nbasis. But the system (58) is exactly that of a minimal surface G1 in S\n3(1) with unit\nnormal G2, induced metric ds\n2 = e\u03b7|dz|2 with the complex coordinate chosen such that the\nsecond fundamental form I\u02dcI of G1 satisfies (I\u02dcI(\u2202, \u2202), I\u02dcI(\u2202, \u2202)) = 1\/4. In particular, since\nI\u02dcI(\u2202\/\u2202x, \u2202\/\u2202y) = 0, we see that the coordinate curves of G1 are the lines of curvature.\nApplying now the definition of U4 of [3] and the expressions for \u03c91, \u03c92 and \u03c93 obtained\nin (48), we get that\nf = 1\ni\n\u221a\n2\n(F \u2227 (\u22122Ft)\u2212 \u03bbFx \u2227 Fy) \u2282 \u039b2C4.\n18\nAn easy calculation using (55) now shows that\nf = 1\u221a\n2\n(ie\u2212\u03b7G1x \u2227G1y \u2212G1 \u2227G2). (59)\nAccording to Lawson in [10], the bipolar surface of the minimal surface G1 in S\n3(1)\nwith unit normal G2 is the surface in S\n5(1) given by G1 \u2227 G2 in \u039b2R4 = R6. This is a\nminimal surface in S5(1). If we include \u039b2R4 in \u039b2C4 via v 7\u2192 (1\/\u221a2)(v \u2212 i ? v), where ?\ndenotes the Hodge star operator on \u039b2R4, then it follows immediately from (59) that f is\nthe bipolar of G1.\nConversely, let G1(z) be a non-totally geodesic minimal immersion in S\n3(1), other than\nthe Clifford torus, with unit normal G2(z). By restricting to an open dense subset if\nnecessary, we may assume that z is such that the induced metric is ds2 = e\u03b7|dz|2, where\n\u03b7 is a positive function satisfying (47), and that the second fundamental form I\u02dcI of G1\nsatisfies (I\u02dcI(\u2202, \u2202), I\u02dcI(\u2202, \u2202)) = 1\/4. Then G1 and G2 will satisfy the system (58), so if we\ndefine F using (55) then F is horizontal in S7(1) and satisfies the system (49)-(54). In\nparticular, we have that z312 = 0 and \u03c91(\u2202\u00af) = 0. If we apply the construction of [3] to the\nprojection of F to CP 3, then we will obtain the bipolar f(z) of G1(z). It then follows from\n(35) that \u03c9 = \u03c9+, so that (45) gives that \u03b3+ = 0. Hence, using Theorem 4, we obtain the\nfollowing.\nTheorem 7 Let f : S \u2192 S5(1) be a minimal immersion, not contained in a totally geodesic\nS3(1), with non-circular ellipse of curvature at every point. Then, on an open dense subset\nof S, the following three statements are equivalent:\n1. \u03b3+ = 0,\n2. f is the bipolar surface of a non-totally geodesic minimal surface in S3(1) which is\nnot the Clifford torus,\n3. the (+)transform f+ is the reflection of f in a great subsphere of S5(1).\nReferences\n[1] J.
