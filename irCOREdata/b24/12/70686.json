In the comprehension stage a \nmodel representing the information in the premises is constructed. In the description \nstage premises are integrated to formulate a putative conclusion. Finally, in the \nvalidation stage this conclusion is compared with alternative models of the premises \nto determine whether it has a counterexample. If no counterexample model is found \nthe conclusion is accepted. Although the MMT of deduction has achieved substantial \nsupport from numerous studies (see Johnson-Laird, 2001), disputes remain over \nwhether deduction might be better understood as involving a \u201cmental logic\u201d (e.g., \nRips, 1994), or probabilistic Bayesian computations (e.g., Chater & Oaksford, 2001). \n The present study tested MMT predictions about premise representation \nduring deduction by monitoring the time people spent processing the components of \ncategorical syllogisms. Such syllogisms consist of two premises and a conclusion, \neach containing one of four logical quantifiers that determine the problem\u2019s mood \n(quantifiers are denoted by letters: A = All, E = No, I = Some, and O = Some\u2026are \nnot). A syllogism\u2019s validity depends on the mood of the premises and conclusion and \nthe order of the terms in the argument (its figure). We follow the convention \n(Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984) of referring to syllogism terms as A, B and C, where A \nis linked to B in the first premise, B to C in the second premise, and A to C in the \nconclusion. Thus, four figures can be defined: AB-BC, BA-CB, AB-CB, and BA-BC.  \nFigural Effects in Syllogistic Reasoning \n Research has shown that a major influence on performance with categorical \nsyllogisms derives from their figure. Figure can bias both performance accuracy and \nFigural Effects    4 \n \ndirectionality preferences for term orders in conclusions (Johnson-Laird & Bara, \n1984). Figure AB-BC is easiest to reason with, followed by BA-CB; the remaining \nfigures promote increasing difficulty. The directionality biases seen in generated \nconclusions take the form of a preference for AC conclusion-term orders with AB-BC \narguments and CA orders with BA-CB arguments. The other figures reveal no \ndirectional preferences. Examining figural effects is the key concern of the present \nstudy as they are critical to understanding the nature of human reasoning. Indeed, \nDickstein (1978) argued that a theory of syllogistic inference would be incomplete \nwithout accounting for figural biases. Importantly, too, figural effects generalise \nbeyond categorical syllogisms, having been observed in conditional inference \n(Grosset & Barrouillet, 2003), in tasks combining disjunctive, conjunctive and \nconditional components (Garc\u00eca-Madruga, Moreno, Carriedo, Guti\u00e9rrez, & Johnson-\nLaird, 2001), and in relational reasoning (Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984). \n Hunter (1957) was one of the first theorists to forward an explanation of \npremise-integration processes, albeit in the relational inference paradigm. Hunter \nproposed two mental operations to enable premise combination: (1) the conversion of \nterms within a premise, or (2) the mental reordering of whole premises. For the AB-\nBC figure the middle terms fall adjacent to each other; the second premise easily \nintegrates with the representation of the first, without recourse to mental operations. \nFor the BA-CB figure the middle terms are not contiguous, so the formation of an \nintegrated representation requires mental operations and is more difficult. Johnson-\nLaird and Bara (1984) adopted Hunter\u2019s proposals as part of the premise-integration \nprocess within the MMT of syllogistic inference. They consider reordering to be the \ndominant mental operation for the BA-CB figure, which results in its representation in \nthe form CB-BA. The AB-CB and BA-BC figures are the most complex as they \nFigural Effects    5 \n \nrequire the conversion of a premise, which is argued to be more cognitively \ndemanding and error prone than premise reordering (Bara, Bucciarelli, & Lombardo, \n2001; though see Roberts, Newstead, & Griggs, 2001, for evidence that conversion \noperations may play only a limited role in syllogistic reasoning). MMT explains \ndirectionality effects in conclusion generation by proposing that reasoners, having \nconstructed integrated models where middle terms are contiguous, state conclusions \nbased on a \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d (FIFO) principle (Broadbent, 1958).  \nStenning (2002), however, is critical of the MMT explanation of figural \neffects on conclusion order, and suggests that it is insufficient merely to claim a role \nfor the FIFO principle without converging evidence. Moreover, he argues that \nsubstantiation of such a mechanism could not, in itself, be taken as definitive support \nfor any particular representational system such as MMT. Indeed, the mental \nmanipulations proposed by Hunter (1957) could be adopted as a component of any \nrepresentational account of deduction that specifies the integration of premises. \nNotwithstanding these arguments, it remains that MMT is the only contemporary \naccount of syllogistic reasoning that explicitly posits a working memory demand \ninduced by figure1 that promotes figural biases on performance. Indeed, the concept \nof working-memory demand is central to the implementation of the description stage \nin the most recent computational model of MMT (Bara et al., 2001). \n Some theorists argue that figural biases are a methodological artefact restricted \nto conclusion-production paradigms (Geurts, 2003; Rips, 1994; Wetherick, 1989), \nwhilst others dispute that cognitive load is induced by figure (see Chater & \nOaksford\u2019s, 1999, probability heuristics model--PHM). For example, in response to \nEspino, Santamar\u00eda, and Garc\u00eca-Madruga\u2019s (2000a) evidence for figural effects based \non the activation of end-terms in memory, Oaksford argues: \u201cTheir finding does not \nFigural Effects    6 \n \naddress the issue of processing difficulty, so it is difficult to see how it bears on \nPHM\u2019s prediction of no differences in processing difficulty between figures\u201d \n(Oaksford, 2001, p. 208). Oaksford disputes the importance of Espino et al.\u2019s results \nfor the PHM, but indicates that if a measure of processing difficulty demonstrated a \nfigural demand, this would challenge the current formulation of this model.  \n Espino, Santamar\u00eda, and Garc\u00eca-Madruga (2000b) produced evidence for \nfigure-induced processing demands with BA-CB relative to AB-BC syllogisms. They \nargued that processing difficulty with figure BA-CB should promote increased \ninspection times for the second premise from a MMT perspective. This prediction was \nsupported using a sequential premise-presentation method that enabled the \nmeasurement of processing times for second premises. However, participants were \nunable to inspect: (1) the first premise after viewing the second, or (2) either premise \nafter the conclusion. This method thus creates an additional working memory burden \nthat may inhibit deployment of preferred reasoning strategies (Gilhooly, Logie, & \nWynn, 2002). We note, too, that studies examining the ease of premise integration in \ntemporal and spatial inference by measuring processing times for individual premises \nhave also typically used sequential\u2014rather than parallel\u2014premise presentation \n(Carrieras & Santamar\u00eda, 1997; Morra, 2001; Vandierendonck & de Vooght, 1996), \nwhich may constrain the nature of preferred reasoning strategies (though see Roberts, \n2000; Schaeken & Johnson-Laird, 2000). Overall, we believe that concerns with the \nsequential presentation method point to the need for a replication of Espino et al.\u2019s \n(2000b) study with a more flexible premise-presentation technique.  \nProcessing Direction in Syllogistic Inference \n The figural effects we have outlined with categorical syllogisms dominate in \nthe conclusion-production paradigm, where premises are given and conclusions \nFigural Effects    7 \n \ngenerated (e.g., Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984). In contrast, figural effects are not well \nestablished in the conclusion-evaluation paradigm, where the validity of presented \nconclusion is assessed (e.g., Evans, Handley, Harper, & Johnson-Laird, 1999). MMT \nhas tended to finesse distinctions between production and evaluation paradigms, \ninstead emphasizing the stages of comprehension, description and validation. There \nis, however, an emerging theoretical debate as to whether processing in evaluation \ntasks involves either: (1) \u201cforward reasoning\u201d from premises to conclusion, as \nespoused in standard MMT and recent variants (e.g., Bucciarelli & Johnson-Laird, \n1999; Bara et al., 2001; Quayle & Ball, 2000); or (2) \u201cbackward reasoning\u201d whereby \nthe presented conclusion is used to guide construction of a model of the premises \n(e.g., Evans, Handley, & Harper, 2001; Hardman & Payne, 1995; Klauer, Musch, & \nNaumer, 2000). The backward-reasoning view is clearly rather different to the \nstandard MMT claim that premise-driven processing underpins syllogistic inference2. \n One response to this debate is the suggestion (Morley, Evans, & Handley, \n2004) that whilst backward reasoning prevails in conclusion-evaluation tasks (as \npresented conclusions can motivate inferential processes), forward reasoning \ndominates in conclusion-production tasks (as there is no given conclusion to guide \nprocessing)3. This proposal provides a compelling account of why figural effects on \nresponse accuracy appear in conclusion-production tasks, but are weak or absent in \nevaluation tasks. Despite Morley et al.\u2019s (2004) claimed support for this position, few \nstudies have systematically examined figural effects in evaluation tasks (but see \nDickstein, 1978, for an account of figural effects in a multiple-choice task). The main \nevaluation-task studies have been those by Evans et al. (2001) and Quayle and Ball \n(2000), which focused primarily on belief bias effects rather than figure per se. It \nmay, therefore, be premature to dismiss either the influence of figural effects in the \nFigural Effects    8 \n \nevaluation paradigm or the possibility that forward reasoning processes may dominate \nin both evaluation and production paradigms. \nOverview of Methodology and Predictions \n Our experiment was devised to replicate and extend Espino et al.\u2019s (2000b) \nstudy by implementing a more flexible process-tracing method. We employed a \ntechnique whereby clicking a mouse cursor on designated screen areas revealed \nsyllogistic components and enabled computer-logging of inspection times. Once the \ncursor was moved from an active screen area the syllogistic component was \nimmediately re-masked. This approach was inspired by mouse- and eye-tracking \nstudies of the Wason Selection Task (Evans, 1996; Ball, Lucas, Miles, & Gale, 2003) \nand, in particular, the \u201cmouse-contingent display\u201d technique pioneered by Schroyens, \nSchaeken, Fias, & d'Ydewalle (1999, 2000) for studying on-line propositional \nreasoning processes (see also Roberts & Newton, 2001).  \n These methods are all predicated on the assumption that inspection times \nprovide a direct measure of the processing effort devoted to problem components \nbeing gazed at. In studying reasoning with categorical syllogisms various predictions \ncan be examined with inspection-time data. According to the standard MMT, AB-BC \nsyllogisms are easier to process than BA-CB ones, and should be associated with \nlower premise inspection times. However, backward-reasoning theories predict no \ninspection-time imbalance across figures, as conclusion-driven strategies will not \nentail re-representation of premises in the BA-CB figure to form an integrated model. \nIn addition, standard MMT also predicts that participants prefer AC conclusions for \nAB-BC syllogisms and CA conclusions for BA-CB syllogisms. Accordingly, non-\npreferred conclusions may be associated with longer inspection times. Again, no such \ninspection time imbalance is predicted by theories emphasising backward-reasoning. \nFigural Effects    9 \n \n In relation to the validity status of conclusions it is also possible to derive \ninspection-time predictions from MMT variants. Some theorists posit no inspection-\ntime differences across components of valid and invalid problems because only a \nsingle possible model is considered in either case (e.g., Evans et al., 2001). Others \n(e.g., Quayle & Ball, 2000) predict lower inspection times for components of valid \nproblems because they require the consideration of only a single model to be \naccepted, whereas invalid problems require further model construction to refute the \nfallacy. Thompson, Striemer, Reikoff, Gunther, and Campbell (2003) likewise predict \nlower inspection times for valid conclusions. They suggest (cf. Evans et al., 2001; \nKlauer et al. 2000) that reasoners only search for a single model that is consistent with \na conclusion, but find this easier for valid conclusions (because all models of the \npremises are consistent with these) than for invalid conclusions (where only some \nmodels are consistent). Yet another construal, based on the standard MMT, is that in \norder to accept a conclusion as valid all possible models require consideration, \nwhereas invalid conclusions require discovery of only a single disconfirming model to \nbe rejected. Thus, interesting oppositional predictions are possible concerning the \nlevel of scrutiny that will be directed at the components of valid and invalid problems. \nMethod \nParticipants \n Forty-four psychology students (aged 18 to 45) from the University of Derby \ngained course credit for participation. None had prior knowledge of reasoning research. \nDesign and Materials \n The experiment involved a 2 x 2 x 2 repeated-measures design that manipulated \nFigure (AB-BC vs. BA-CB), Mood (IEO vs. EIO), and Validity (valid vs. invalid). The \ndependent measures were conclusion-acceptance rates and inspection times for the \nFigural Effects    10 \n \ncomponents of presented syllogisms (i.e., Premise 1, Premise 2, and Conclusion). \nParticipants were presented with eight target syllogisms (four in figure AB-BC; four in \nfigure BA-CB) in the moods IEO and EIO. Half the problems were presented with a \nlogically valid conclusion, and half with an invalid possible strong conclusion (Evans et \nal., 1999). IEO problems have a valid Some A are not C conclusion and an invalid Some \nC are not A conclusion, whilst the reverse holds for the EIO problems. There were four \npractice items in the moods AEA, III, IAI and AEE. The content of all syllogisms was \nneutral, and involved arbitrary combinations of professions, pastimes, and hobbies. The \norder of problems was partially counterbalanced and content was systematically rotated \nthrough the different problem forms. Authorware 5.1 running on Windows PCs was \nused to present instructions and problems and to record responses and inspection times. \nProcedure \n Participants were presented with the following computer-based instructions: \n\u201cThis is an experiment to test people\u2019s reasoning ability. You will be shown 16 \nreasoning problems. For each problem there will be three masked statements. These will \nbe labelled \u2018Premise 1\u2019, \u2018Premise 2\u2019 and \u2018Conclusion\u2019. By clicking your mouse on the \nmasked areas you can reveal the statements. For each problem you are asked if the \nconclusion given below the premises may be logically deduced from them. You should \nanswer this question on the assumption that the two premises are, in fact, true. You may \nrevisit each of the three masked areas as many times as you wish although you cannot \nview more than one area simultaneously. [An example problem was presented at this \npoint]. If, and only if, you judge that the conclusion necessarily follows from the \npremises, you should click \u2018Yes\u2019; if you judge that it does not necessarily follow you \nshould click \u2018No\u2019. Please take your time and be sure that you have the right answer \nbefore giving your response. After each trial a box will appear saying \u2018Click to \nFigural Effects    11 \n \ncontinue\u2019. Do this when you are ready to proceed. The first four trials are practice \nitems\u201d. \nResults and Discussion \nConclusion-Acceptance Rates \n Statistical assessment of conclusion-acceptance rates (Table 1) using Analysis of \nVariance (ANOVA) revealed a reliable main effect of Validity, with valid conclusions \nbeing accepted more frequently than invalid ones (68% vs. 52%), F(1, 43) = 5.09, MSE \n= .541, p = .029. No other effects or interactions were evident. Acceptance rates for the \npresent syllogisms are similar to previous conclusion-evaluation studies (e.g., Evans et \nal., 1999). The main effect of Validity supports the view that people have a modicum of \ndeductive competence on this task whilst simultaneously being biased toward accepting \nconclusions not strictly warranted by the given premises (Evans & Over, 1997). \n (Table 1 about here) \nInspection Times \n Table 2 summarizes inspection-time data relating to syllogistic components \ncollapsed over correct and incorrect conclusion-evaluation responses (cf. Thompson et \nal., 1993, for evidence that time-based measures in syllogistic inference are comparable \nbetween collapsed data and correct-only data). Descriptive analysis revealed that data \nwere positively skewed. A square-root transformation reduced this skew successfully, \nand statistical analyses were performed on transformed data. For clarity of interpretation \nwe report inspection-time means throughout the paper both before transformation and \nconverted back into original units (seconds) after transformation.  \n(Table 2 about here) \nPremise inspection times. An ANOVA was conducted on premise inspection-\ntime scores using the factors of Figure (AB-BC vs. BA-CB), Validity (valid vs. invalid), \nFigural Effects    12 \n \nand Premise Component (Premise 1 vs. Premise 2), and collapsing across Mood. This \nrevealed a reliable main effect of Figure, F(1, 43) = 6.08, MSE = 0.729, p = .018, with \npremises in the BA-CB figure inspected for longer than premises in the AB-BC figure. \nThis result indicates increased processing demands associated with premises when \nmiddle terms are non-contiguous, and supports the critical MMT prediction that \nadditional mental manipulations are required to align such premise terms (Johnson-\nLaird & Bara, 1984). The analysis failed to support a main effect of Validity, F(1, 43) = \n2.39, MSE = 0.507, p = .13, although the mean cumulative premise inspection time for \nvalid syllogisms (13.97 s after transformation) was less than that for invalid syllogisms \n(15.23 s after transformation). There was no significant effect of Premise Component, \nF(1, 43) = 1.27, MSE = .359, p = .28. \n An assessment of the specific locus of premise-based inspection-time effects \nwas possible by examining the data for the presence of an interaction between Premise \nComponent (Premise 1 vs. Premise 2) and Figure (AB-BC vs. BA-CB). For syllogisms \nin the BA-CB figure the greatest inspection time should arise for Premise 1 as this \nneeds to be both refreshed and integrated with the representation of Premise 2 (Johnson-\nLaird & Bara, 1984), whereas inspection times for two premises in the AB-BC figure \nshould be similar to one another as Premise 2 simply needs to be integrated with the \ncurrent representation of Premise 1. The mean values depicted in Table 2 suggest that \nthis pattern of premise-inspection times is evident, and an ANOVA revealed that the \ninteraction between Premise Component and Figure was reliable, F(1, 43) = 4.36, MSE \n= 0.149, p = .043. LSD main effects analyses demonstrated a significant difference \nbetween Premise 1 viewing times in the AB-BC figure compared with the BA-CB \nfigure (p = .007), with the latter being higher than the former. There was no significant \ndifference between Premise 1 and Premise 2 inspection times for the AB-BC figure, \nFigural Effects    13 \n \nalthough there was a near significant difference between Premise 1 and Premise 2 \ninspection times for the BA-CB figure (p = .072), with Premise 1 having the larger \nmean viewing time, as per MMT predictions. \n Conclusion inspection times. Our analyses of conclusion inspection times were \ndevised: (1) to test the MMT prediction of increased inspection times for conclusions in \na non-preferred direction relative to a preferred direction (reflecting a conflict between \nthe directionality of presented conclusion terms and the directionality of terms in mental \nmodels), and (2) to examine validity effects on conclusion inspection times as the \npresence of processing differences for valid and invalid conclusions is informative \nabout the status of different contemporary variants of MMT. Conclusion inspection-\ntime data are presented in Table 3, collapsed across Mood and Figure. An ANOVA \nrevealed a reliable main effect of Conclusion Direction, F(1, 43) = 7.40, MSE = .35, p = \n.009, with non-preferred term directions being inspected for longer than preferred ones. \nThere was also a reliable main effect of Validity, F(1, 43) = 6.02, MSE = .516, p = .018, \nwith invalid conclusions being viewed for longer than valid ones. Conclusion Direction \nand Validity were not found to interact, F(1, 43) = 0.26, MSE = .49, p = .61. \n(Table 3 about here) \n    General Discussion \n Our study tested predictions based on the standard MMT of syllogistic \nreasoning (Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991), including the claimed role of forward-\nreasoning processes that begin with premise modelling and progress to conclusion \nexamination. Under this view, problem figure impacts directly on the processing \neffort required to formulate models of premises, and figural influences should \ngeneralise across conclusion-production and conclusion-evaluation tasks. To date, \nhowever, studies that have used an evaluation paradigm (Evans et al., 2001; Morley et \nFigural Effects    14 \n \nal., 2004; Quayle & Ball, 2000) indicate that figure has a limited influence on \nconclusion acceptance rates, though few studies have examined more subtle \nprocessing-time measures. Recently, too, it has been suggested that evaluation tasks \nmay be less biased by figure than production tasks, as the former may be dominated \nby conclusion-driven processes (e.g., Morley et al., 2004).  \n Our experiment focused on the evaluation paradigm and assessed whether the \nfigure of categorical syllogisms impacts the processing of problems components (i.e., \npremises and conclusions). The study involved an inspection-time methodology \nsimilar to that pioneered by Espino et al. (2000b), but enhanced to allow recursive \ninspection of previous problem components post-activation to enable detection of the \nprecise locus of figural effects on processing. Moreover, the flexibility to visit and \nrevisit premises and conclusions facilitated the examination of the specific syllogistic \ncomponents that are associated with relatively longer or shorter inspection-times and \nthe testing of processing effects relating to preferred versus non-preferred conclusion \ndirections predicted under MMT (e.g., Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984). \n A key prediction derived from the standard, premise-driven MMT was that \nthere should be increased viewing of the premises of BA-CB problems relative to AB-\nBC ones, because BA-CB premises require an additional mental operation (re-\nordering Premise 1 after Premise 2) to bring middle terms into contiguity. This \nfinding was supported. MMT also permitted a more fine-grained prediction to be \nmade: For syllogisms in the BA-CB figure, increased viewing times should arise for \nPremise 1 relative to Premise 2 since it is the representation of Premise 1 that must be \nrefreshed prior to integration with the representation of Premise 2. For the AB-BC \nfigure there should be no marked difference in viewing times for the two premises, \nFigural Effects    15 \n \nwhich can be integrated in a straightforward manner. The predicted interaction pattern \nbetween figure and premise component was evident in the inspection-time data. \n A final prediction from MMT related to directionality biases associated with \nthe processing of presented conclusions relative to the assumed order of premise \nterms in models. We predicted increased inspection times for conclusions whose \nterms were in a non-preferred direction versus conclusions whose terms were in a \npreferred direction. This is because participants would be expected to linger longer \nover conclusions in non-preferred directions, whilst engaging in a process of scanning \nmodels in a cognitively demanding right-to-left direction rather than the more natural \nleft-to-right direction assumed under a FIFO principle (Johnson-Laird & Bara, 1984). \nThis effect was reliable. Overall, the MMT view of syllogistic inference as a forward, \npremise-to-conclusion process achieves good support from our inspection-time data. \n We next consider evidence for predictions derived from recent variants of the \nMMT of syllogistic inference (Hardman & Payne, 1995; Quayle & Ball, 2000), which \npropose that valid conclusions can be endorsed as necessary without the need for \nalternative models to be formulated, whereas invalid but \u201cpossible\u201d conclusions \nrequire multiple-model construction (see Thompson et al., 2003, for an identical \nprediction based on an alternative MMT account). As such, invalid problems might be \nexpected to be associated with greater premise refreshing and increased conclusion \nscrutiny in order for models to be actively maintained and fleshed out in working \nmemory, and compared with given conclusions. The predicted validity effect on \npremise inspection times was in the correct direction but was not significant, whereas \nthe influence of validity on conclusion inspection times was highly reliable. \n Overall, our experiment supports key processing assumptions of MMT in its \nstandard form (Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991) and some its recent variants that also \nFigural Effects    16 \n \npropose forward-reasoning processes in the evaluation paradigm (e.g., Quayle & Ball, \n2000). The figure of a syllogism has detectable influences on premise and conclusion \nprocessing in a syllogistic-evaluation paradigm, even though such effects have limited \nimpact upon acceptance rates, which remain stable across the relatively \u201ceasy\u201d figures \nstudied here (AB-BC and BA-CB). The validity status of syllogistic conclusions also \nhas a demonstrable effect on conclusion processing and conclusion-acceptance rates. \n Evidence for figural influences in an evaluation paradigm runs counter to \nclaims (Morley et al., 2004) for a dissociation between processing direction in \nconclusion-evaluation versus conclusion-production tasks. Morley et al. propose that \nforward reasoning dominates in the conclusion-production paradigm, whereas \nbackward reasoning prevails in conclusion-evaluation. Our evidence for figural \neffects on processing in the evaluation paradigm is not easily reconcilable with this \nposition. However, Morley et al.\u2019s use of belief-oriented materials might explain the \ndiscrepant findings across studies (see also Ball, Phillips, Wade, & Quayle, 2006, for \neye-tracking evidence of conclusion-driven processing in a belief-bias paradigm). \nBelief-oriented conclusions may compel reasoners toward a conclusion-driven \nprocess, whereas neutral conclusions may instead promote a premise-driven process.  \n Although our evidence for a figure-induced working-memory load is \ninconsistent with several contemporary theories, we agree with Stenning (2002) that \nthis does not provide fundamental evidence against the core principles of accounts \nthat emphasise either rule-based or heuristic processes operating on syntactic aspects \nof presented information. In fact, the reordering processes proposed by Hunter (1957) \ncould be appended to alternative representational accounts such as those based on \nmental logic or Euler circles. Moreover, Stenning and Yule (1997) suggest that spatial \narrays or verbal lists are plausible explanations of the memory implementation in \nFigural Effects    17 \n \nsyllogistic reasoning, although these mechanisms require more detailed specification \nto account for all of our premise inspection data. Ford (1994) proposed an algebraic \nsubstitution procedure that would certainly incur a demand on working memory. \nHowever, this explanation was not corroborated by data presented by Espino et al. \n(2000a) based on their experiments testing the activation of end terms, which \nsupported a premise-reordering manipulation. Finally, some theorists propose that \nfigural bias in syllogistic reasoning stems from a rhetorical principle based on the \ntendency for people to use as the subject of the conclusion a term that has appeared as \nthe subject of one of the premises(e.g., Wetherick & Gilhooly, 1990; see also Chater \n& Oaksford\u2019s, 1999, probability heuristics model). While such theoretical positions \nhave not previously been associated with the notion of a cognitive load, it has recently \nbeen suggested (Oberauer, H\u00f6rnig, Weidenfeld, & Wilhelm, 2005) that an inadvertent \nselection of a middle term from the first premise as the subject of the conclusion may \noccur in the figure BA-CB, and that this putative subject term would require revision \nupon the reading of the second premise and the realisation that it is, in fact, a middle \nterm. Such a process could explain increases in premise inspection times. \nWe acknowledge that most theories of syllogistic reasoning might well be able \nto extrapolate their central principles to provide an account of figural influences on \npremise and conclusion processing in a way that could accommodate inspection-time \neffects as seen in the present study. It remains for the advocates of these theories to \nmeet this challenge. However, we would argue that it is to the credit of mental models \ntheory that it alone successfully predicted the full range of inspection-time evidence \nobserved in our study.  \nFigural Effects    18 \n \nReferences \nBall, L.

Although this theory does not directly specify working memory \ninvolvement, it does lend itself to an implicit assumption that working memory loads \nmay be associated with figural influences on performance. \n 2 The contrast between forward and backward processing described here refers \nto premise-driven versus conclusion-driven processing as defined by Morley, Evans, \nand Handley (2004), rather than the distinction applied by Dickstein (1978) when \ncontrasting subject-to-predicate and predicate-to-subject processing with classical \nsyllogisms. \n 3 We are mindful to refer to the possibility that forward and backward \nreasoning may dominate processing in syllogistic reasoning rather than proposing that \nreasoning would be observed to be deterministically in either form. We recognise the \ninherent flexibility of much cognitive processing (e.g., Siegler, 1996) such that it \nwould make little sense to predict that all participants will perform the same way on \nall presented tasks, or, indeed, that individuals will behave the same on all trials. \nInstead, our research on figural effects focuses on the prevailing processing approach \nused in the evaluation paradigm. \n \n \n Figural Effects   25 \n \nTable 1 \nPercentage of Conclusion Acceptances as a Function of Figure, Mood,  and \nConclusion Validity  \n           Figure AB-BC         Figure BA-CB  \nConclusion validity   IEO  EIO  M  IEO  EIO  M \nValid \n \n68 55 62  75 71 73 \nInvalid \n \n54 50 52  45 59 52 \nM 61 53 57  60 65 63 \n       Figural Effects       26 \n \nTable 2 \nMean Inspection Times (in Seconds) for Components of Syllogisms as a Function of Figure, Mood, and Conclusion Validity  \n                                           Figure AB-BC  Figure BA-CB \n IEO EIO M       IEO EIO M \n Syllogism component ND TD ND TD ND TD       ND TD ND TD ND TD \nValid              \n   Premise 1 6.44  5.20 8.97 7.29 7.70 6.25 7.74 6.97 9.06 7.78 8.40 7.38 \n   Premise 2 6.43  5.62 8.62 6.97 7.52 6.30 8.02 7.18 6.68 5.76 7.35 6.47 \n   Conclusion 5.68 4.93  6.76 5.90 6.22 5.42 5.25 4.67 4.82 4.33 5.03 4.50 \nInvalid              \n   Premise 1 7.95 6.50 6.97 6.15 7.46 6.33 10.59 8.82 9.49 8.12 10.04 8.47 \n   Premise 2 8.28 7.13 6.80 5.66 7.54 6.40 8.8 7.78 8.49 7.56 8.64 7.67 \n   Conclusion 7.26 6.10 5.15 4.49 6.21 5.30 6.97 6.20 7.64 6.50 7.31 6.35 \nNote.
