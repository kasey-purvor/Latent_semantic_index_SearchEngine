It is caused by a\nsevere or partial impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis\naffecting cortisol biosynthesis. Approximately 5\u20138% of\nall cases are due to steroid 11\u0001-hydroxylase deficiency\n(11OHD; OMIM \u0001202010), which occurs in approxi-\nmately 1:100,000 to 1:200,000 live births in nonconsan-\nguineous populations (1).\nSteroid 11\u0001-hydroxylase (CYP11B1, EC 1.14.15.4)\nconverts 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone\n(DOC) to cortisol and corticosterone, respectively. Inac-\ntivatingCYP11B1mutations causean impairmentof these\ntwo reactions. Therefore 11OHD results in an accumula-\ntion of the precursor steroids, which are shunted into the\nadrenal androgen synthesis pathway, resulting in viriliza-\ntion of female external genitalia (46,XX disordered sex\ndevelopment). Postnatal androgen excess causes preco-\ncious pseudopuberty, rapid somatic growth, and acceler-\nated bone maturation in both sexes. The accumulation of\nDOC, which binds and activates the mineralocorticoid\nreceptor, leads to hypertension in about two thirds of pa-\ntients (1).\nA milder, nonclassic 11OHD form (2, 3), with a phe-\nnotype resembling nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n(4), is caused by partial impairment of CYP11B1 function\n(2). The frequency of this mild form is unknown, but it\nappears to be rare (2, 3). Nonclassic 11OHD canmanifest\nwith mild virilization and precocious pseudopuberty in\nchildren and with signs and symptoms suggestive of poly-\ncystic ovary syndrome in adult women. However, unlike\nclassic 11OHD, arterial hypertension is not commonly\nfound in the nonclassic form (2).\nThe CYP11B1 gene is localized on chromosome 8q21,\napproximately 40 kb from the paralog aldosterone syn-\nthase gene (CYP11B2) (5). A mutation cluster in exons 2,\n6, 7, and 8 has been suggested (6, 7). However, a large\nnumber ofCYP11B1-inactivatingmutations are localized\nto other gene regions (Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1,\npublished as supplemental data on The Endocrine Soci-\nety\u2019s JournalsOnlineweb site at http:\/\/jcem.endojournals.\norg). In addition, chimeric CYP11B2\/CYP11B1 genes\nabolishing 11\u0001-hydroxylase function have been de-\nscribed (8\u201310).\nHerein, we have characterized seven novel CYP11B1\nmutations identified in threepatientswith classic 11OHD,\ntwo patients with a mild form (nonclassic) of the disease,\nand three heterozygote carriers for CYP11B1 mutations.\nTo prove the disease-causing effect of the novelCYP11B1\nvariants, the mutations were functionally characterized\nusing an in vitro expression system. The results of the in\nvitro analysis confirmed themolecular diagnosis of 11OHD\nin five patients and allowed the 11OHD carrier status to be\nestablished in the other three individuals.\nPatients and Methods\nPatients with classic CYP11B1 deficiency\nPatient 1. p.[W116G]\u0002[R448H]\nThe male patient of Eastern German origin first presented 34\nyr ago at the age of 2 yr when admitted with vomiting. Signs of\nprecocious pseudopuberty were noted, including pubic hair, pe-\nnile growth, andacceleratedbone age (BA)of 7 yr.Hewasmildly\nhypertensive (110\/85 mmHg). The history revealed that the pe-\nnile growth, growth acceleration, and pubic hair development\nhad started at age 11 months. He was treated with prednisolone\nuntil the age of 22 yr, when dexamethasone was introduced. His\nfinal height was well within the normal range (182 cm). At\npresent, he is mildly overweight (bodymass index, 26.87 kg\/m2)\nand normotensive (100\/70 mm Hg). A current clinical assess-\nment revealed normal sexual function, normal sperm count, and\nandrogens in the normal male range.\nPatient 2. p.[Q19X]\u0002[A165D]\nThe male patient of British Caucasian origin was diagnosed\n41 yr ago at the age of 21 months. He presented with enlarged\npenis, pubic hair, and acne. At diagnosis he was hypertensive\n(130\/90 mm Hg; 140\/90 mm Hg). Currently he receives glu-\ncocorticoid treatment with prednisolone and antihypertensive\ntherapy with a combination of spironolactone, amiloride, and\nfurosemide.\nPatient 3. p.[K254_A259del]\u0002[K254_A259del]\nThe 13-yr-old patient of Kuwaiti origin was born with an\napparently male genital phenotype. It is reported that shortly\nthereafter he was diagnosed as suffering fromCAH. The patient\nwas commenced on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone replace-\nment and was reared as a boy. At age 11 yr, he was hypertensive\n(140\/100 mm Hg), with a height of 141.1 cm [\u00021.74 SD score\n(SDS)] andbodymass indexof19.39kg\/m2 (\u00010.28SDS).Hehad\naBAof15.5 yr.On examination, he hada6-cmstretchedphallus\nwith penoscrotal hypospadias, fused rugose scrotum with no\npalpable gonads, and internal female genitalia. Chromosome\nanalysis established the diagnosis of 46,XX disordered sex de-\nvelopment. The patient is now on hydrocortisone replacement\nand has been gonadectomized.\nPatients with nonclassic CYP11B1 deficiency\nPatient 4. p.[M88I]\u0002[R384Q]\nThe boy (46,XY karyotype) from Spain presented at age 10.3\nyrwith precocious puberty. Physical examination revealed pubic\nhair stage P3, genital stage G3, a testicular volume of 8 ml, and\nacne. He was normotensive. The parents reported that they had\nnoted penile growth continuously since birth. His height was\n159.2 cm (\u00013.26 SDS) with an advanced BA of 14 yr. Blood\npressure was within the normal range. Basal and cosyntropin-\nstimulated 11-deoxycortisol levels were elevated at 114 and\n135 nmol\/liter, respectively (normal values,\u000311.6 and\u000323.1\nnmol\/liter).\n780 Parajes et al.

Seven Novel CYP11B1 Mutations J Clin Endocrinol Metab, February 2010, 95(2):779\u2013788\npreviously described (13). Site-directed mutagenesis was per-\nformedusing theQuikChangeXLSite-DirectedMutagenesisKit\n(Stratagene, Amsterdam, TheNetherlands). Insertion of themu-\ntations and the integrity of the insert were checked by direct\nsequencing. Approximately 3.5 \u0005 105 COS7 cells were plated\n24 h before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with\n1 \u0002g of each pcDNA3.1-CYP11B1 construct, 0.5 \u0002g of adreno-\ndoxin (pECE-Adx), and 0.5 \u0002g of Adx reductase (pECE-ADR)\nexpression vectors (kindly provided by Professor W. L. Miller,\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of California, San Fran-\ncisco, CA), using Fugene-HD transfection reagent according to\nthemanufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianap-\nolis, IN). COS7 cells were incubated with the transfection re-\nagents for 24 h at 37 C in DMEM supplemented with 200 mM\nglutamine and 10% fetal calf serum, followed by a further 24-h\nincubation in fresh full DMEM media.\nThe kinetic constants of CYP11B1 in intact COS7 cells were\ndetermined 48 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for\n90 min at 37 C with 1000 \u0002l DMEM containing 5 \u0002mol\/liter\n18\u0001-glycyrrhetinic acid (an 11\u0001-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\ninhibitor to inhibit the 11\u0001-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type\n2 activity endogenous to COS7 cells, which otherwise facilitates\nthe further conversion of the reaction product cortisol to corti-\nsone), 0.2 \u0002Ci 3H-labeled 11-deoxycortisol, and 2, 5, 10, or 15\n\u0002mol\/liter unlabeled 11-deoxycortisol. Steroids were extracted\nwith 5 ml dichloromethane, concentrated by evaporation at 55\nC, and separated by thin-layer chromatography on PE SILG\/UV\nsilica gel plates (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) using a 300:\n20:1 dichloromethane:methanol:water solvent system. Sub-\nstrates and conversion products were identified by comparison\nwith comigration of unlabeled reference steroids and quantified\nusing a Bioscan 2000 image analyzer (Lablogic, Sheffield, UK).\nAll assayswere performed in at least three independent triplicate\nexperiments, and data are presented as means \t SEM. Kinetic\nparameters were established by nonlinear regression, using the\nMichaelis-Menten equation to determine theMichaelis-Menten\nconstants Km and Vmax. Catalytic efficiency was defined as the\nratioVmax\/Kmexpressed as percentage ofwild-type.Mutations\nwith undetectable activity under the above conditions were in-\ncubated for24hat37Cwith1ml fullDMEMcontaining0.2\u0002Ci\n3H-labeled 11-deoxycortisol and 250 nmol\/liter unlabeled 11-\ndeoxycortisol as previously described (13). Cells were scraped\nfromtheplates, resuspended in cold1xPBS, and sonicated for cell\nlysation. A Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)\nwas used for total protein assessment. The 11\u0001-hydroxylase ac-\ntivity of the mutants was expressed as a percentage of substrate\nconversion in nanomoles per milligram of total protein per\nminute, defining CYP11B1 wild-type activity as 100%. Enzyme\nkinetic parameters and enzymatic activity were calculated using\nthe GraphPad Prism software version 4.0 (GraphPad, Inc., San\nDiego, CA).\nTo ensure comparable levels of expression and translation of\nCYP11B1 wild-type and mutant proteins, Western blot analysis\nwas performed using an antihuman-CYP11B rabbit antiserum\n(kindly provided byDr. H. Takemori, Department ofMolecular\nPhysiological Chemistry, Osaka University Medical School,\nOsaka, Japan) as previously described (13).\nMolecular modeling\nThedetailed generationof the humanCYP11B1 three-dimen-\nsional structure model using the x-ray structure of the mamma-\nlian cytochrome CYP2C5 (Pdb code 1DT6) as a template has\nbeen described previously (13, 14). The structural representa-\ntions were generated using the programs Deep View\/Swiss-Pdb\nViewer (http:\/\/www.expasy.org\/spdbv\/) and Molsoft ICM\nBrowser Pro (Molsoft L.L.C, La Jolla, CA).\nResults\nMolecular genetic analysis of the CYP11B1 gene\nSeven novel mutations in eight nonrelated individuals\nwere detected (Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1). Patient\n1 was a heterozygous for the novel T to G transversion at\nposition 733 (g.733T\u0004G, p.W116G) and the known\np.R448H mutation (11) on the other allele. Patient 2\nwas a compound heterozyogous for a novel C toA trans-\nversion at position 2690 (g.2690C\u0004A; p.A165D) and a\ndescribed nonsense mutation (p.Q19X) (15). Patient 3\ncarried a novel homozygous 18-bp deletion resulting in\na six-amino acid in-frame deletion (g.3093_3110del,\np.K254_A259del).\nPatient 4 was a compound heterozygous for the novel\nG to A substitution at position 651 (g.651G\u0004T; p.M88I)\non the maternal allele and for the severe mutation\np.R384Q (6) on the paternal allele. A novel heterozygous\nC to T transition at nucleotide 2672 was found in the\nunrelatedpatients 5and6 (g.2672C\u0004T;p.P159L). Patient\n5 was homozygous for the p.P159L mutation, whereas\npatient 6wasaheterozygous carrier for thep.P159Lallele.\nPatient 7 was confirmed to be a heterozygous carrier for a\nnovel C to T transition at position 4077 (g.4077C\u0004T,\np.R366C). Patient 8 was also a heterozygous carrier hav-\ning a novel A to G transition at nucleotide 4660\n(g.4660A\u0004G, p.T401A). PartialCYP11B1 gene deletions\nin the carriers were ruled out by Southern blot analysis.\nFunctional 11\u0001-hydroxylase in vitro assays\nThe sevennovelCYP11B1mutationswere functionally\nanalyzed using transiently transfectedCOS7 cells measur-\ning the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. The\nthree mutations detected in patients with classic 11OHD\n(p.W116G; p.A165D; p.K254_A259del) had absent en-\nzymatic activity.\nOnly the p.A165D mutation showed some conversion\nfor 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol after incubating these\nthreemutationswith a lower 11-deoxycortisol concentra-\ntion (250 nmol\/liter) for 24 h. The conversion rate of\np.A165Dwasnot expressed in percentageCYP11B1wild-\ntype activity because it would overestimate the residual\nactivity.\nThe other four mutations (p.M88I, p.Pro159Leu,\np.R366C, and p.T401A) detected in patients with mild\n11OHDandheterozygous carriers resulted in partial 11\u0001-\nhydroxylase impairment. The p.M88I mutation reduced\nJ Clin Endocrinol Metab, February 2010, 95(2):779\u2013788 jcem.endojournals.org 783\nactivity to 39.8 \t 6.4% of wild-type. p.P159L and\np.R366C showed a similar impairment with 25.8\t 3.3%\nand 23.0 \t 3.1% of wild-type activity, respectively.\np.T401A had 37.5 \t 3.8% of the normal 11\u0001-hydroxy-\nlase activity (Fig. 1A).\nDetermination of kinetic constants showed similar Km\nvalues for p.M88I, p.R366C, and p.T401A with signifi-\ncantly impairedVmax comparedwithwild-type (Fig. 1B).\nThe p.P159L mutation did not reach substrate saturation\nunder the established reaction conditions.\nWestern blot analysis demonstrated that all mutations\napart from the p.K254_A259delmutation had translation\nefficiency similar to wild-type. The p.K254_A259del mu-\ntation resulted in a smaller band of decreased intensity\n(data not shown).\nDiscussion\nHerein, we have characterized three severe and four mild\nCYP11B1 mutations found in three patients with classic\n11OHD, in two patients with nonclassic 11OHD, and in\nthree heterozygous carriers. Apart from the p.P159L mu-\ntation, allmutationsweredetected indifferent individuals.\nHowever, there was no obvious connection between the\npatient homozygous for the p.P159L from Eastern Ger-\nmany and the heterozygous carrier from Spain. The in\nvitro activity of the less severely affected allele was con-\nsistent with the clinical phenotype in all affected patients.\nDiagnostic criteria such as an 11-deoxycortisol response\nafter 1-24ACTH stimulation to differentiate between het-\nerozygous carriers and patients withmild 11OHD are not\nwell established, such as differentiation by 17OHP re-\nsponse to 1-24ACTH in 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The\ntwo genetically proven carriers studied had normal or\nmildly elevated basal 11-deoxycortisol levels and showed\na variable increase of 11-deoxycortisol to 1-24ACTH\nstimulation. This variability has previously been reported\nin patients with mild or nonclassic 11OHD (2).\nFunctional effects of CYP11B1 mutations\nInvitro11\u0001-hydroxylase activityof less than5%canbe\nconsidered severe and ismost likely associatedwith classic\n11OHD (6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17). However, a significant\nnumber of detected CYP11B1 missense mutations have\nnot been functionally analyzed yet (15, 18\u201324) (Table 1),\nwhich does not allow for exact phenotype prediction.\nWe demonstrated a partially impaired CYP11B1 activ-\nity in four of the novel mutations, which are associated\nwith nonclassic 11OHD. Until now, only three mild\nCYP11B1 mutations detected in three patients with non-\nclassic 11OHD have been functionally analyzed (2). The\nresidual 11\u0001-hydroxylase enzyme activity of these previ-\nously described mutations (p.P42S, p.N133H, and\np.T319M) ranged from 15 to 40% of wild-type activity.\nThis is a similar magnitude as the in vitro activity of our\np.M88I, p.P159L, p.R366C, and p.T401A mutations.\nFour otherCYP11B1 variants (p.R43Q, p.P135S, p.F139L,\nand p.T196A) resulted in approximately 30\u201350% resid-\nual CYP11B1 activity (16). These variants were found in\na cohort study analyzing the effect of CYP11B1 variants\non the etiology of hypertension, and no data on the sex\nhormone status are available. All previously described in\nvitro studies on mild CYP11B1 mutations employed sig-\nnificantly longer incubation times for the analysis of the\np.P42S, p.N133H, and p.T319Mmutations (15\u201324 h) (2)\nand for the analysis of thep.R43Q,p.P135S, p.F139L, and\np.T196A variants (24 h) (16). This potentially overesti-\nmates the in vitro CYP11B1 activity of mutations. Using\nsimilar incubation times for ourmildCYP11B1mutations\nFIG. 1.

The p.P159L mutation is not\nshown because this mutation did not reach substrate saturation under\nthe employed reaction conditions.\n784 Parajes et al. Seven Novel CYP11B1 Mutations J Clin Endocrinol Metab, February 2010, 95(2):779\u2013788\nresulted in a significant overestimationwith an increase to\n55\u201363% of wild-type activity (data not shown). The re-\nsidual activity of mild mutations described in this paper\n(p.M88I, p.P159L, p.R366C, and p.T401A) are within\nthe well-established range of 21-hydroxylase mutations\ncausing nonclassic CAHwith a residual 21-hydroxylase\nactivity of about 20\u201350% (25, 26).\nPutative effects of severe CYP11B1 mutations\nThe tryptophan 116 residue is highly conserved in the\nCYP11 family across species (Fig. 2), and two severe mu-\ntations at codon 116 have already been described (12, 14).\nTrp116 lies in the B-C loop (Fig. 3), which contains the\nsubstrate recognition site 1, oneof sixpostulated substrate\nrecognition sites (27). The side chains of Trp116 and\nLeu113 interact with Phe223 and Trp247. Thus, the\nchange from the aromatic tryptophan to the small ali-\nphatic glycine might alter the conformation of the sub-\nstrate access channel in a similar fashion as the p.W116C\nmutation (14). This alteration might impact on substrate\naccess and product release, thereby abolishing CYP11B1\nfunction.\nAlanine165 is localized in theDhelixofCYP11B1 (Fig.\n3) and conserved in theCYP11 family, includingmembers\nof hepatic CYP2C monooxygenases (Fig. 2C), with the\nexception of humanCYP11A1 (Fig. 2A).No acidic amino\nacids suchas aspartic acid are present at the corresponding\nresidue in aligned cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) (Fig.\n2). The change to Asp165 does not lead to obvious steric\nproblems in silico with neighboring residues, but it\nchanges the polarity and structure of the protein surface.\nThis changewillmost likely not affect redox-partner bind-\ning because it takes place on the opposite side of the\nCYP11B1 protein. Further conclusions on the effect of the\np.A165D mutation on CYP11B1 from the comparison\nwith other steroidogenic CYP enzymes are difficult. No\nmutations in the D helix of CYP17A1 have been reported,\nand only twomutations without functional data available\ninCYP21A2 (p.V139W;p.C147R)havebeendescribed to\nFIG. 3.

In general, the\nF and G helices and F-G-loop together with the B-C loop\ncontrol access to the active site of mammalian CYP en-\nzymes, with he F and G helices and F\/G-loop forming the\nroof of the substrate-binding pocket (29). Therefore, a\ndeletion within this structure can be predicted to result in\nan enzyme with absent CYP11B1 function, consistent\nwith our patient\u2019s clinical phenotype and absent in vitro\nCYP11B1 activity.\nPutative effects of mild CYP11B1 mutations\nThe methionine 88 residue localized in the N-terminal\nregion is not highly conserved and an isoleucine is present\nat the corresponding position of murine 11\u0001-hydroxylase\n(Fig. 2). M88 is found in a region connecting the A and B\nhelices (Fig. 3). It lies in a hidden cove on the surface of\nCYP11B1 and forms an H-bond with E383, which is lo-\ncalized in a \u0001 sheet of the K-L loop. The substitution for\nisoleucine does not lead to any major structural changes.\nThere is only a minor polarity change on the surface of\nCYP11B1. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the p.M88I\nmutation only leads to mild reduction of in vitro 11\u0001-\nhydroxylase activity.\nProline 159 is conserved within the CYP11 family and\nis found in CYP21A2, CYP3A4, and CYP3A7 (Fig. 2).\nHowever, various types of aminoacids are present in other\nCYP enzymes ranging from hydrophobic, over polar to\nacidic and basic amino acids in other CYP enzymes. P159\nis localized in theD helix opposite the L helix. A change to\nleucine would not affect the protein surface, neither pre-\ndictedH-bond formation nor interferencewith residues in\nthe L helix. However, the presence of a leucine residue at\nthis position (L159) removes a small kink fromtheDhelix.\nThis might lead to a minor change in orientation of the E\nhelix butwithout obviousdirect effect on the active center.\nOverall, these in silico changes are consistent with the\npartially preserved in vitro activity of p.P159L.\nThe arginine 366 residue is localized in the K helix (Fig.\n3) and conserved within the CYP11B family. A lysine res-\nidue is present at the corresponding position of CYP11A1\nenzymes (Fig. 2). This lysine residue (K377 in human\nCYP11A1) appears to be involved in binding the electron\nproviding factor Adx (30). The side chain of R366 faces\ntoward the protein surface, and a change to cysteine\n(p.R366C) eliminates a positive surface charge. This mu-\ntation leaves a cove on the surface, which most likely im-\npacts on Adx binding. Other residues are involved in the\nCYP-Adx interaction (30, 31), including amino acid res-\niduesR453 andR454,which remain intact. Amutation of\nresidue R453 (p.R453Q) resulted in almost absent\nCYP11B1 activity (32) emphasizing the importance of\nthese two arginine residues (R453, R454). The change to\ncysteine at position 366 might also lead to an interaction\nwith T359. Threonine 359 is localized in the J-K loop, but\nthis proposed new interaction has no obvious effect on the\nactive center. Therefore, p.R366C might affect the inter-\nactionwith the electron providing factor Adx and thereby\npartially impair CYP11B1 function.\nAlthough the threonine 401 can be found in a huge\nnumber of CYP enzymes, valine residues are present at the\ncorresponding residue in CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 (Fig. 2).\nThe effect of the p.T401Amutation appears less dramatic\nas expected from the clustalW alignment. Threonine 401\nis localized in between the K and L helices. The side chain\nfaces toward the surface providing a surface hydroxyl\ngroup.The change to alanine 401 leads to loss of this polar\ngroup and leaves a small cove on the surface, but it does\nnot lead tomajor steric changes. The onlyminor change is\nthe possible loss of a weak interaction with arginine 80.\nTherefore, the in silico findings are consistent with mild\nimpairment of the CYP11B1 in vitro activity of the\np.T401A mutation.\nIn conclusion, we have confirmed the inactivating na-\nture of the sevennovelCYP11B1mutations. Furthermore,\nfourCYP11B1mutationswith significant residual activity\nassociated with nonclassic 11OHD were characterized.\nThis doubles the number of reported mutations responsi-\nble for mild 11OHD. Our findings emphasize the impor-\ntance of considering mild 11OHD in patients presenting\nwith signs and symptoms similar to nonclassic 21-hydrox-\nylase deficiency. Therefore, our data are essential for the\nclinical and genetic counseling, helping to estimate the\nseverity of clinical disease expression in 11OHD.\nAcknowledgments\nAddress all correspondence and requests for reprints to: Nils\nKrone, M.D., Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabo-\nlism, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of\nBirmingham, Institute of Biomedical Research, Wolfson Drive,\nBirmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.
