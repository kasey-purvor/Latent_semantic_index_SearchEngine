Watching television tends to be a social activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt to groups of \nusers rather than to individual users. In this paper, we discuss different strategies for combining individual user \nmodels to adapt to groups, some of which are inspired by Social Choice Theory. In a first experiment, we \nexplore how humans select a sequence of items for a group to watch, based on data about the individuals\u2019 \npreferences. The results show that humans use some of the strategies such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. \nAdditive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about \nfairness and avoiding individual misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how satisfied people believe \nthey would be with sequences chosen by different strategies, and how their satisfaction corresponds with that \npredicted by a number of satisfaction functions. The results show that subjects use normalization, deduct misery, \nand use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though not \ncompletely correct predictions. According to our subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies give \nsatisfaction to all individuals in the group. The results also show that subjects put more emphasis than expected \non showing the best rated item to each individual (at a cost of misery for another individual), and that the ratings \nof the first and last items in the sequence are especially important. In a final experiment, we explore the \ninfluence viewing an item can have on the ratings of other items. This is important for deciding the order in \nwhich to present items. The results show an effect of both mood and topical relatedness. \n \nKeywords Group modeling, interactive television, social choice, adaptation, recommender \n1 Introduction \n 1\nInteractive television offers the possibility of personalized viewing experiences. Different domains have been \nidentified in which this personalization would have a great impact, such as education (Masthoff & Luckin, \n2002), news (Maybury, Greiff, Boykin, Ponte,  McHenry & Ferro, 2004), advertising (Lekakos, \nPapakiriakopoulos & Chorianopoulos, 2001), and electronic program guides (Cotter & Smyth, 2000). Adapting \ntelevision to individual viewers is a topic in itself, and a lot of research has already been done, particularly in the \narea of electronic program guides (e.g., O\u2019Sullivan, Smyth, Wilson, McDonald, & Smeaton, 2004). This research \ntends to build on decades of work on content-based and social filtering. In this paper, we will explore an even \nmore difficult issue: adaptation to a group of viewers. We believe this to be essential for interactive television as, \nin contrast to the use of PCs, television viewing is largely a family or social activity (Barwise & Ehrenberg, \n1988; Kasari & Nurmi, 1992). Unfortunately, television-viewing statistics do not include data on the average \nnumber of people watching television together and who watches television with whom (as also noted by Gillard, \n1999). It is very likely to be culturally dependent, as the number of televisions per household varies widely. \nAccording to a large research study in the UK (Livingstone & Bovill, 1999), television is the medium most often \nshared with family. Watching television together is top of the list of activities shared between parents and \nchildren, and more than two thirds of children watch their favorite programme with somebody else, nearly \nalways family. Children most often watch with their siblings (Van Evra, 1998). Young people would like to \nwatch television with friends, though (due to a lack of resource) many do not manage to do so (Livingstone & \nBovill, 1999). Given the rising number of televisions in bedrooms it is likely that watching television with \nfriends will be an increasingly popular activity. Already, television is the most popular conversation topic of \nyoung people with friends (Livingstone & Bovill, 1999). For these reasons, we believe that adaptive television \nshould be able to adapt to groups of people watching together. These groups can be quite heterogeneous, and \nage, gender, intelligence, and personality influence what types of TV programmes people enjoy (Kotler, Wright \n& Huston, 2001; Gillard, 1999; Livingstone & Bovill,1999). The question then arises how one can adapt to a \ngroup of viewers, in such a way that each individual enjoys (and in educational programs, benefits from) the \nbroadcast. \n2 Strategies for combining user models \nUser modeling has been widely studied, particularly the modeling of user preferences (directly or indirectly via \nobservation and inference) (see UMUAI journal, User Modeling conferences). In contrast, group modeling \u2013\ncombining individual user models to model a group\u2013 has hardly been investigated in our field. There are only \nthree main adaptive systems that use it: MUSICFX (McCarty & Anagnost, 1998), POLYLENS (O' Conner, Cosley, \nKonstan & Riedl, 2001), and INTRIGUE (Ardissono, Goy, Petrone, Segnan, & Torasso, 2002). MUSICFX is used \nin a company's fitness center to select background music to suit a group of people working out at any given time. \nPOLYLENS is a group recommender extension of MOVIELENS, which recommends movies based on an \nindividual's taste as inferred from ratings and social filtering. It allows users to create groups and ask for a \nrecommendation for that group. INTRIGUE recommends places to visit for tourist groups taking into account \ncharacteristics of subgroups within that group (such as children and disabled). Though some exploratory \nevaluation of MUSICFX and POLYLENS has taken place, for none of these systems it has been investigated how \neffective their group modeling strategies really are, and what the effect would be of using a different strategy. \nBesides, the application domains of both POLYLENS and MUSICFX differ from television viewing in the sense \nthat these systems do not need to select a group of items: people normally only see one movie per evening, and \nmusic stations can play forever1. For INTRIGUE, on the other hand, it is quite likely that a tourist group would \nvisit multiple attractions during their trip, but the selection of a balanced sequence has not been addressed yet. \nOur view on adaptive interactive television is that reasonably small video segments would be concatenated (this \nis in line with Maybury et al., 2004, who mention that their newsitems on average are only 51 seconds long). The \nsmaller the segments the more adaptation and real interactivity can take place.  \n \nThough group modeling has hardly been studied in our field, the related issue of social choice (also called group \ndecision making) \u2013deciding what is best for a group given the opinions of individuals\u2013 has been studied \nextensively in economics, politics, sociology, and mathematics (see, e.g. Condorcet, 1785; Pattanaik, 1971; \nTaylor, 1995). Their construction of a social welfare function is very similar to our group modeling problem. \nOther areas in which the problem has been studied are Meta-Search, Database Middleware, Collaborative \nFiltering, and Multi-Agent systems. In Meta-Search, the ranking lists produced by multiple search engines need \nto be combined into one list (they call this the problem of rank aggregation). See, for instance, Dwork, Kumar, \nNaor, Sivakumar (2001), and Cohen, Schapire, and Singer (1999). Dwork et al. base their work on social choice \ntheory, and use a variant of the method of Kemeny, which uses an extended Condorcet principle (see Section 2.2 \nfor an explanation of the ordinary Condorcet principle, and why we object to it). In Database Middleware, \nobjects have to be ordered where each object has numerical values for multiple fields (see for instance, Fagin, \nLotem, and Naor, forthcoming). In Collaborative Filtering, preferences of a group of individuals have to be \naggregated to produce a predicted preference for somebody outside the group. See Pennock, Horvitz and Giles \n(2000) for an explanation of how social choice theory applies to collaborative filtering. In multi-agent systems, \nagents need to take decisions that are not only rational from an individual\u2019s point of view, but also from a social \npoint of view. See Hogg and Jennings (1999) for a discussion of social rationality for agents and its links to \nSocial Choice Theory. See Ephrati and Rosenschein, (1996) for how a social decision mechanism (namely the \nClarke Tax mechanism) can be used to reach consensus between multiple non-cooperative (possibly cheating) \nagents. \n \nIn this section, we will discuss some of the issues, and present a number of example strategies. \n2.1 Focusing our problem and introducing an example \nAssume the television has a set of items to choose from. These can be news items, quiz questions, MTV music \nclips, television programs, etc. For our discussion we will just call them items (and video clips in the \nexperiments). Assume the television needs to adapt to a group of viewers. Assume the television knows who the \n                                                          \n 2\n1 This would have been different if MUSICFX selected individual songs rather than radio stations. \nviewers are, and the system has preference ratings for each of them (say from 10, really like, to 1, really hate). \nThe problem now is which items should the television show, given that it has time for a certain number but not \nall of them? \n \nAn example of this situation is given in Table 1. There are three viewers, John, Adam and Mary, and the \ntelevision has ten items to select from (A to J). For each item, it knows the preference ratings, for instance, John \nreally likes A, but Adam really hates it. The problem is what should the TV show if it has time for only one \nitem? What if it has time for two items? Etc. \n \nTable 1. Example ratings for a group of three viewers. \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \n \nThe example in Table 1 will be used to illustrate the strategies described below, and will also be used in the \nexperiments presented in Sections 3 and 4. \n \nNote that we have made a number of simplifications: we have assumed that a number of problems have been \nsolved while actually they are still a focus of much research. For example: \n\u2022 How will the television know who is watching it? Solutions have been proposed in the form of an individual \ninfrared card which registers viewers automatically (Lieberman, van Dyke, & Vivacqua, 1999), an \nindividual token which you have to put on the television, a login procedure (which can take a conversational \nform, with the television asking who is watching it tonight), and a probabilistic mechanism using the time of \nday combined with a known probability of a viewer watching at that time (Goren-Bar & Glinansky, 2002). \n\u2022 How will the preferences of the individual users be determined? Social, and content-based filtering can be \nused, combined with stereotypes (see many papers in Ardissono & Buczak, 2002). Obviously, there is a \ncomplication in that it is difficult to make inferences from actions when a group watches the television, but \nactions at times the user watches alone could be used combined with a probabilistic model when watching in \ncompany. Plua and Jameson (2002) describe a mechanism by which groups of people who know each other \nwell can help each other to specify their preferences. An additional complication is that an individual\u2019s \nratings might depend on the group they are in. For instance, a teenager might be very happy to watch a \nprogramme with his younger siblings, but might not want to see it when with his friends.  \n\u2022 Dealing with differences in rating tendencies. Not all people have the same rating behavior. Some people only \nuse the ends of the scale, they either \"really hate\" or \"really love\" an item. Others only use the middle, never \nbeing very positive, and never being really negative.  A \"7\" by Pete, who is always very negative, may be a \nfar more positive review than a \"9\" by Tim, who likes everything. Note that similar differences may occur \nwhen ratings are inferred from viewing behavior. These differences in behavior should be taken into account \nwhen using ratings as input for a group model. One way to do this is to normalize them. Though we have \nnot assumed the ratings of John, Adam and Mary to be completely comparable (and indeed some differences \nin rating tendencies can be seen in the example, e.g. between John and Adam), we have simplified our \nproblem by giving all individuals \u201creasonable\u201d rating behaviors. For instance, none of them only uses the \nends of the scale.   \n\u2022 Dealing with uncertainty. The preferences as determined by filtering mechanisms do not have to be correct \n(though accuracy is growing). For the research in this paper, we will assume the ratings to be accurate. We \nwill revisit this issue in the Areas for Further Work section in the conclusions. \n\u2022 Changing groups. We assume that the group remains the same during the whole sequence. If one member of \nthe group needs to leave early (a child, for instance, who has to go to bed) then it is likely that the \npreferences of that person should have greater weight when they are present. \n\u2022 Dealing with multidimensionality. Often, you have ratings in multiple dimensions, rather than just one \ndimension. For instance, in adaptive instruction, there are many reasons for selecting an item, such as the \nstudent's existing knowledge (does it fulfill the prerequisites), learning goal and learning style, the \neducational flow (does it built on what has been explained before), etc. One way to match this onto the \nmodeling as discussed above would be to construct a single rating for each item based on how it scores on \nthese criteria. Masthoff (2003) describes a way in which the aggregation methods discussed in this paper can \nbe used to aggregate ratings of different criteria. \n 3\n\u2022 How will the recommendations be presented to the group? We assume that the television decides which items \nto show, so, does not give the viewers a choice. One kind of application we are considering is a personalized \nnews program. So, instead of watching a news broadcast that is the same for all viewers (like the BBC \nnews), you would watch a news program with items in it that are automatically selected for the group of \npeople you are watching with. Most recommender systems, in contrast, would present their list of \nrecommendations to the user, and different ways have been devised on how to do this. For instance, \nZimmerman, Parameswaran, and Kurapati (2002) discuss using celebrities (a photo combined with text) to \npresent generated content recommendations (for instance, for an Electronic Program Guide).  \n \nAll of these problems merit more research, but are beyond the scope of this paper. \n2.2 Desirable properties \nIn Social Choice Theory, some consensus exists about desirable properties of voting systems, but it has been \nproven that no system can have all these properties (Arrow, 1950), and, arguably, this is why different voting \nsystems exist in different countries, institutions, and societies (see Cranor, 1996, for about 20 of these, and \nSection 2.3 for a selection). One analysis of 27 democracies over a period of 45 years found a staggering 70 \ndifferent voting systems being used for national elections (Lijphart, 1994). \nSome examples of desirable properties that have been proposed: \n\u2022 Pareto rule (Pareto, 1897). \nIf at least one person prefers x to y and nobody prefers y to x, then x should be above y in the ranking. If \nnobody prefers x to y and nobody prefers y to x, then x and y should share a place in the ranking. \nIn our example, everybody prefers F to G. Hence, F should precede G in the group list. Similarly, F should \nprecede H, as John and Mary prefer it and Adam does not mind. \nIn this manner, we find: \nB should precede C    D should precede B,C,G  E should precede G,I  \nF should precede B,C,D,G,H,J  H should precede B,C,G,J  J should precede C,G \n\u2022 Anonymity (May, 1952). \nIf the ratings of two individuals are swapped for all alternatives, then the resulting sequence should remain \nthe same. Note that dictatorship violates this rule, and that it can be well defended that in real life television \nviewing not everybody has to have equal rights all the time. For instance, if it is John\u2019s birthday than maybe \nit is fair to give John more satisfaction on that day than the others. \n\u2022 Positive Association. (Arrow, 1951). \nIf alternative x preceded alternative y in the sequence, then an increase in an individual's rating of x should \nmaintain x's position before y in the sequence. \nIf alternative x appeared equal to alternative y in the sequence, then an increase in an individual's rating of x \nshould lead to x being before or equal to y in the sequence. Note that it is tempting to say that x should \nprecede y in the latter case, but this is too strong a condition. For instance, if the sequence was determined \non the basis of Plurality Voting (see below), then x and y could be equal because as many people preferred x \nto y as preferred y to x. Increasing the rating of x for one individual does not necessarily change this.  \n\u2022 Condorcet winner criterion (Condorcet, 1785). \nAn alternative x is a Condorcet winner if for each other alternative y:  \nx is preferred to y by the majority of individuals. \nThe criterion states that if a Condorcet winner exists then it should top the group list on its own. \nA weaker version allows it to share the top of the group list.  \nThe criterion becomes stronger when modifying the Condorcet winner definition to  \n\u201dx is preferred or equal to y by the majority of individuals.\u201d \nIn our example, both E and A are Condorcet winners using this definition.  \nWe do not agree with this criterion (not even in its weakest form). Assume an item x is rated 10, 1, 10 (as A \nis in our example). Assume all other items are rated 9, 9, 9. Item x is then a Condorcet winner, but it can be \nargued that it should not top the group list, given the misery it produces for the second individual.  \n \nOur resistance to the Condorcet winner criterion highlights another property we might want our voting systems \nto have: \n\u2022 Each individual\u2019s satisfaction with the results should be above a certain threshold.  \nWhen a sequence of items is selected for a group to watch, the individual\u2019s satisfaction could be measured at \n 4\nthe end of the sequence, or, in a stronger version of this rule, at any moment in the sequence. Note that the \nlatter does not necessarily mean that the individual\u2019s satisfaction with each item should be above a certain \nthreshold, as satisfaction is considered in the context of the items shown so far. For instance, consider a \nsequence \u201c8  9  3  10\u201d. If we want to measure satisfaction at any moment in the sequence, then we would \nhave to measure the satisfaction after having seen \u201c8\u201d, after having seen \u201c8  9\u201d,  \u201c8  9  3\u201d, and \u201c8  9  3  10\u201d. \nThe satisfaction of the individual after having seen \u201c8  9  3\u201d could well be higher than the satisfaction with \n\u201c3\u201d on its own, so this sequence might pass this criterion, while a sequence \u201c3  8  9  10\u201d might fail.   \n \nWe will need to determine empirically whether typical TV viewers share our negative feelings about the \nCondorcet winner criterion, and whether they agree with our individual satisfaction rule.  \n2.3 Example strategies \nMany strategies, also called \u201csocial choice rules\u201d, \u201cgroup decision rules\u201d, and \u201crank aggregation functions\u201d, have \nbeen devised for reaching group decisions given individual opinions. We will discuss some simple ones (the first \nfive originate from social choice theory and the latter five from our specific use), and illustrate them with the \nexample introduced above. The example will show the 'group list' resulting from the strategy, a sequence \nindicating in which order the items would be chosen. Sometimes, two items score the same, like E and F in the \nAdditive Utilitarian strategy. That is indicated in the group list by placing them between brackets. This means \nthat either E is followed by F, or F followed by E. The main purpose of this section is to show that many \ndifferent, all seemingly logical, strategies can be devised, all of which have quite distinct results when applying \nthem to the example. \n \n1. Plurality Voting (also called 'first past the post'). Each voter votes for his or her most preferred alternative. \nThe alternative with the most votes wins.  This method is, for instance, used in UK elections. When a \nsequence of alternatives needs to be selected, this method can be used repetitively: first, an election is held for \nthe first place in the sequence, next for the second place, etc. In the example, John would like to vote for A, E, \nor I (all ratings of 10). Adam for B, D, F, or H, and Mary for A. Traditionally in Plurality voting, each \nindividual has only one vote, so, John would have to decide whether to vote for A, E, or I. If John were aware \nof the preferences of the others, then it is likely that he would vote for A, as with Mary\u2019s vote this would \nsecure a majority. In our scenario, with only three individuals and ten items, it is quite likely that a vote would \nend in a tie (in contrast to politics, where the number of individuals tends to be a lot larger than the number of \nalternatives). If John were to vote for E or I, then all three individuals would vote for a different item, and \nthere would be no winner. It would clearly be in John\u2019s interest to vote A. In our case, the television would \ndecide on a choice for the group, and as the television would be aware of all individuals\u2019 preferences, it could \neasily accommodate strategic voting, to prevent ties. Our interpretation of Plurality Voting in this context will \ntherefore be that rather than giving individuals one vote, we allow them to vote for all items that have the \nhighest rating. In our example, this gives A two votes, and it becomes the start of the sequence. Next, John \nlikes to vote for E or I, Adam for B, D, F, or H and Mary for E. With two votes E has most votes, and \nbecomes second in the sequence. \n 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 10 \nJohn A,E,I E,I I I H,J J G C \nAdam B,D,F,H B,D,F,H B,D,F,H B,D,H B,H B B C \nMary A E F D,I H,J J B,G C \nGroup A E F D,I H J B,G C \n        \n \nGroup List: \nAEF(I,D)HJ(B,G)C \n \nInstead of using the method repetitively, each voter could vote for x alternatives (with x being the length of \nthe sequence). \n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \nJohn AEI AEIF AEIFHJ AEIFHJDG \nAdam BDFH BDFHJC BDFHJCE BDFHJCEG \nMary A AE AEF AEFDI AEFDIHJ AEFDIHJBG \nGroup A AE AEF F(AEDI) F(AEDIHJ) FHJ(AEDI) FHJED(AI) FHJEDG(AIB)\n \n 5\n2. Utilitarian Strategy. Utility values for each alternative (expressing the expected happiness) are used, instead \nof just using ranking information (as in plurality voting). This can be done in multiple ways: \nAdditive. Ratings are added, and the larger the sum the earlier the alternative appears in the sequence. Note \nthat the resulting group list will be exactly the same as when taking the average of individual ratings. For this \nreason this strategy was called the \"Average strategy\" in (Masthoff, 2002). This strategy (often in a weighted \nform, where weights are attached to individual ratings) is used in multi-agent systems (Hogg & Jennings, \n1999) and Collaborative filtering. This is also the strategy used in the INTRIGUE system (Ardissono et al, \n2002), with a weighting depending on the number of people in the subgroup and the subgroup\u2019s relevance \n(children and disabled had a higher relevance). \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nGroup 21 18 13 22 26 26 17 23 20 22 \n        \n \n \n   Group List: \n   (E, F) H (D, J) A I B G C \n \nMultiplicative. Instead of adding the utilities, they are multiplied, and the larger the product the earlier the \nalternative appears in the sequence.  \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nGroup 100 180 48 378 630 648 180 432 210 384 \n        \n \n \n Group List: \n F E H J D I (B, G) A C \n \nA disadvantage of the utilitarian strategy is that an individual viewer might always lose out, because their \nopinion happens to be a minority view. This is more likely to cause problems the larger the group. After all, in \na small group the opinion of each individual will have a large impact on the average\/product. \n \n3. Borda Count (Borda, 1781). Points are awarded to each alternative according to its position in the individual's \npreference list: the alternative at the bottom of the list gets zero points, the next one up one point, etc. For \ninstance, in our example John has the lowest rating for C, and hence, C is awarded 0 points. A problem arises \nwhen an individual has multiple alternatives with the same rating. We have decided to distribute the points. \nSo, for example, in Mary's list B and G share the place one up from the bottom and get (1+2)\/2 = 1 1\/2 points \neach. To obtain the group preference ordering, the points awarded for the individuals are added up.   \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 8 1 0 2 \u00bd 8 6 2 \u00bd 4 \u00bd 8 4 \u00bd \nAdam 0 7 \u00bd 4 \u00bd 7 \u00bd 3 7 \u00bd 2 7 \u00bd 1 4 \u00bd \nMary 9 1\u00bd 0 5\u00bd 8 7 1\u00bd 3\u00bd 5\u00bd 3\u00bd \nGroup 17 10 4\u00bd 15\u00bd 19 20\u00bd 6 15\u00bd 14\u00bd 12\u00bd \n        \n \n \n Group List: \n F E A (H, D) I J B G C \n \n4. Copeland Rule (Copeland, 1951). This is a form of majority voting. It orders the alternatives according to the \nCopeland index: the number of times an alternative beats other alternatives minus the number of times it loses \nto other alternatives. For instance, in the example A beats B as both John and Mary prefer it.  \n A B C D E F G H I J \nA 0 - - - 0 - - - 0 - \nB + 0 - + + + 0 + + + \nC + + 0 + + + + + + + \nD + - - 0 + + - 0 0 - \nE 0 - - - 0 - - - - - \nF + - - - + 0 - - - - \nG + 0 - + + + 0 + + + \nH + - - 0 + + - 0 + - \nI 0 - - 0 + + - - 0 - \nJ + - - + + + - + + 0 \nIndex +7 -6 -9 +1 +8 +5 -6 0 +3 -3 \n        \n \n \n Group List: \n E A F I D H J (B, G) C \n \nNote that in the example the resulting group list is almost identical to the one resulting from repetitive \nplurality voting. \n \n 6\n5. Approval Voting. Voters are allowed to vote for as many alternatives as they wish. This is intended to promote \nthe election of moderate alternatives: alternatives that are not strongly disliked. This type of voting is used by \nseveral professional societies, like the IEEE. In our example, we could assume that John, Mary, and Adam \nvote for all alternatives with a rating above a certain threshold. They could vote for all alternatives with a \nrating higher than 5, as this means voting for all alternatives they like at least a little bit.  \n \nThreshold 5. \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 1   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \nAdam  1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 \nMary 1   1 1 1  1 1 1 \nGroup 2 1 1 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 \n        \n \n \n   Group List: \n   (D, E, F, H, J) (G, A, I) (B, C) \n \nThreshold 6. \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 1    1 1  1 1 1 \nAdam  1 1 1 1 1  1  1 \nMary 1   1 1 1   1  \nGroup 2 1 1 2 3 3 0 2 2 2 \n        \n \n \n   Group List: \n   (E, F) (A, D, H, I, J) (B, C) G \n \n6. Least Misery Strategy. Make a new list of ratings with the minimum of the individual ratings. Items get \nselected based on their rating on that list, the higher the sooner. The idea behind this strategy is that a group is \nas happy as its least happy member. POLYLENS (O' Conner, Cosley, Konstan & Riedl, 2001) uses this \nstrategy, assuming groups of people going to watch a movie together tend to be small and a small group to be \nas happy as its least happy member. A disadvantage is that a minority opinion can dictate the group: if \neverybody really wants to see something, but one person does not like it, then it will never be seen.   \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nGroup 1 4 2 6 7 8 5 6 3 6 \n        \n \n \n   Group List: \n   F, E, (H, J, D), G, B, I, C, A \n \n7.

Average Without Misery Strategy. Make a new list of ratings with the average of the individual ratings, but \nwithout items that score below a certain threshold (say 4) for individuals. \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nGroup - 18 - 22 26 26 17 23 - 22 \n        \n \n   Group List: \n   (E, F), H, (D, J), B, G (threshold 4) \n   (E, F), H, (D, J), I, B (threshold 3) \nMUSICFX (McCarty & Anagnost, 1998) uses a more complex version of this strategy.  Their users rate all \nmusic stations, from +2 (really love this music) to -2 (really hate this music). These ratings are converted to \npositive numbers (by adding 2) and then squared to widen the gap between popular and less popular stations. \nAn Average Without Misery strategy is used to generate a group list. To avoid starvation and always picking \nthe same station, a weighted random selection is made from the top m stations of the list (m being a system \nparameter).  \n \n9. Fairness Strategy. Top items from all individuals are selected. When items are rated equally, the others' \nopinions are taken into account. The idea behind this strategy is that it is not so bad to watch something you \n 7\nhate, as long as you get to watch the things you really love as well. This strategy is often applied when people \ntry to fairly divide a set of items: one person chooses first, then another, till everybody has made one choice. \nNext, everybody chooses a second item, often starting with the person who had to choose last on the previous \nround. It continues till all items have been used. In our example, if we assume John chooses first, then John \nwould like A, E, or I. He could choose E because it causes the least misery to others and has the highest \naverage. Next it is Adam's turn. Adam would like B, D, F, or H. He could choose F because it has the best \nratings for the others. Mary would choose A (her highest rating). Next, Mary would like E, which has already \nbeen shown, and then F, which also has already been shown. Therefore, it makes sense to let Adam choose. \nHe likes B, D, or H. He chooses H, as that has the best ratings for the others. Following this strategy, we could \nend up with a group list like: E, F, A, H, I, D, B, etc. The list would, of course, be different if we let Mary or \nAdam choose first. However, we would expect A to be within the first three items, as it is the item Mary \nprefers most. \n \n10.Most Respected Person Strategy (Also called \"Dictatorship\"). The ratings of the most respected person are \nused --in our example assume that is Adam--, only taking the ratings of the others into account to choose \nbetween similarly rated items. The idea behind this strategy is that groups may be dominated by one person. \nFor instance, some research shows that the television remote control is most often operated by the oldest male \npresent. Similarly, adults may have more influence than children (could depend on the time of day, adults \nhaving more influence later in the day). Visitors may have more influence than inhabitants of the house. \nSpecial circumstances, like birthdays, illness, etc. can influence who is \"the most respected\" person on a \nparticular moment. This strategy is used often in collaborative filtering under the name of \u201cthe nearest \nneighbor strategy\u201d: only the preferences of the individual closest in taste to the outsider are used.  \nA more sophisticated use of differences in social status would be to assign weights to the individuals' ratings. \nAs mentioned above, this has also been used in collaborative filtering and in the INTRIGUE system (Ardissono \net al, 2002), both of which use a weighted additive utilitarian strategy. \n A B C D E F G H I J \nJohn 10 4 3 6 10 9 6 8 10 8 \nAdam 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \nMary 10 5 2 7 9 8 5 6 7 6 \nGroup 1 9 8 9 7 9 6 9 3 8 \n        \n \n \n   Group List: \n   F H D B J C E G I A \n2.4 Summary of strategies and the issue of Satisfaction \nTable 2 summarizes the results of the previous section. \n \nTable 2.

One major difference between strategies is the emphasis placed on individual satisfaction, particularly \n 8\navoidance of misery, compared to the satisfaction of the majority of the group. A clear example is the location of \nA in the group lists, an item that is very much hated by Adam (rating 1), but loved by both John and Mary \n(ratings 10). Plurality Voting puts A at the top of its list, and it ranks also highly in the lists of the Copeland, \nBorda, Most Pleasure and Fairness strategies. In contrast, the Average Without Misery strategy completely \nignores A, and A also ranks at the bottom of the lists of the Least Misery and Utilitarian Multiplicative strategies. \n \nA second major difference between the strategies is whether they use only the relative position of items in each \nindividual\u2019s preference list, or also the strengths of these preferences. The Plurality, Copeland, Borda, and Most \nRespected Person strategies only use relative positions, unlike the Utilitarian, Least Misery, Average Without \nMisery, and Most Pleasure strategies. \n \nAs discussed in Section 2.2, we believe strategies should have a property like \u201cEach individual\u2019s satisfaction \nwith the results should be above a certain threshold\u201d. So, to determine how good the strategies are we need a \nway of measuring each individual\u2019s satisfaction with the sequences they produce. Note that this is something the \nchoice strategies do not tell us. One way of doing this would be to have a Satisfaction Function that takes as \ninput a sequence and an individual\u2019s and their friends\u2019 ratings and produces as output a number that quantifies \nthe individual\u2019s satisfaction with that sequence. Ideally, such a Satisfaction Function would be empirically \nvalidated, for example by predicting individuals\u2019 satisfaction with sequences and then measuring in an \nexperiment how satisfied they really are (see Experiment 2, Section 4). A good Satisfaction Function would be a \nfast way to test how strategies perform under many different circumstances (like group size, ratings, sequence \nlength, etc.).  Additionally, the construction of a good Satisfaction Function would provide valuable insights into \nwhat makes a good strategy. \n \nA basic Satisfaction Function \nIn its simplest form, a Satisfaction Function would take as input a set of ratings for any sequence of clips and \nproduce as output a real number. One such function that has been used a lot is Addition: the summation of the \nindividual\u2019s ratings of the clips concerned. So, for instance, John\u2019s satisfaction with FEAHD would be 43 \n(9+10+10+8+6), while Mary\u2019s would be 40 (8+9+10+6+7). Though without thresholds we cannot say whether \nthese numbers amount to high or low satisfaction, the function would predict that John would be more satisfied \nthan Mary. \nThe issue of normalization \nA basic Satisfaction Function as sketched above only considers the ratings of the selected clips. It does not take \ninto account how these ratings compare to those of the unselected clips. So, for instance, ratings of \u201c6 5 6 7\u201d \nwould produce the same satisfaction whether the other clips had ratings of \u201c9 10 10 10 10 9\u201d or \u201c1  2  1  3  1  4\u201d. \nTo counteract this, normalization can be used, by dividing the sum of ratings of the selected clips by the \nmaximal \u201cpossible\u201d sum for that individual. For instance, the maximum sum for John for a sequence of five \nitems is 47 (namely 10+10+10+9+8), while the maximum for Mary is 41. So, John\u2019s satisfaction with FEAHD \nwould be 0.91 (43\/47), while Mary\u2019s would be 0.98 (40\/41). We could then conclude that Mary would be more \nsatisfied than John (in contradiction with the results without normalization). Normalization is one way to \ncounteract differences in rating tendencies.2  \n \nThe issue of linearity \nAn issue that has not been taken into account by any of the described strategies is that ratings are not necessarily \nlinear. The question arises whether the difference between a \u201c9\u201d and a \u201c10\u201d should really be as big as between a \n\u201c6\u201d and a \u201c7\u201d. We have the hypothesis that the further away from the middle point of the scale (in our example \n5.5 can be seen as Neutral), the larger the difference between subsequent ratings. So, both the differences \nbetween a 9 and a 10 and between a 1 and a 2 are larger than the difference between a 6 and a 7. To achieve this, \nwe could convert the ratings \u201c1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\u201d for our satisfaction function into \u201c \u201325 \u201316 \u20139 \u20134 \u20131 +1 +4 +9 \n+16 +25\u201d. This has for instance as a result that FE would give Mary a higher satisfaction (16+4=20) than JC \n(9+9=18), while the satisfaction would be equal if ratings were considered linear (FE= 9+7=16, JC = 8+8=16).  \n                                                          \n 9\n2 Note that normalization only works when we assume each individual to have some items they like. For \ninstance, we would not want to conclude that a selection of  \u201c2  2  2  2\u201d with other items of  \u201c1  1  1  1  1\u201d, would \nmake this individual 100% satisfied. \nThe issue of misery \nAnother question is whether satisfaction depends on pleasure only (the sum of the positive numbers as a \nproportion of the maximum achievable pleasure) or whether it is also affected negatively by disagreeable \nexperiences (more than because of losing out on possible pleasure).  \nThe issue of order \nUntil now, we have considered the Satisfaction Function to take as input a set of ratings (whether only of \nselected or also of unselected items). This assumes that the order of the sequence does not impact the \nSatisfaction. However, the impact of viewing an item on the user's happiness is likely not only to depend on the \nviewer's liking for the item in isolation, but also on the context in which the item is shown. It is well known in \nthe advertising world that the context of an advertisement has an impact on its effectiveness and resulting brand \nevaluation. In particular, studies have shown that the viewer's mood (as induced by watching the preceding \nprogram) has a significant effect on brand evaluations (Meloy, 2000; Gardner, 1985), with the viewer responding \nmore positively if they were in a more positive mood. The liking of a television program has a similar significant \neffect (Murray, Lastovicka, and Singh, 1992; Schumann and Thorson, 1990). So, we hypothesize that an item \nthat is rated as, say, a 3 could be perceived more highly after having watched a 10, and less highly after having \nwatched a 1. There is also an interaction between the emotional tone of commercials and programs (Kamins, \nMarks, and Skinner, 1991): viewers preferred a sad commercial in the middle of a sad program, and a humorous \ncommercial in a humorous program. This forms the basis for consistency theory, which suggests that viewers try \nto maintain a mood throughout a program. For example, after watching a \"September 11th\" news item, viewers \nmight prefer watching another sad item, rather than a funny one, even when normally they would rate the funny \none higher. Other content aspects are also likely to play a role. An item about \u201cthe position of the Kurds in Iraq\u201d \nmay be appreciated more than its individual rating suggests, after having just seen an item about \u201cthe US \nposition on Iraq\u201d.   \nThe issue of solidarity \nIs it possible to determine an individual\u2019s satisfaction without considering the satisfaction of the others in the \ngroup? Would a person be as satisfied with a certain sequence when his friend got a sequence of \u201c1 2 1 3\u201d as he \nwould be when his friend got a sequence of \u201c7 8 6 8\u201d? Hogg and Jennings (1999) deal with this issue in multi-\nagent systems by adding a weighted measure of the satisfaction of the society. They consider weights between 0 \n(a very selfish agent) and 1 (a very sociable agent). In fact, the situation could be even more complicated: \nsomebody could be jealous of the pleasure of their friend, so their satisfaction would decrease if their friend\u2019s \nratings increased. Note that this is quite likely when siblings are watching television together. \n \nSo, how do we decide which is the best Satisfaction Function? A way to find such function is to determine some \nplausible functions before measuring (reported) human satisfaction in an experiment, and to use these functions \nto predict the experimental outcomes. A comparison between the predictions and the real outcomes would then \nproduce insights into the relative merits of the Satisfaction functions and their weaknesses. Additionally, the \nexperiment could produce the needed threshold value. We will report on such an experiment in Section 4. First, \nhowever, we have explored how people act when confronted with the task our strategies perform.  \n3 Experiment 1: How real people do it \nOne can easily create hundreds of strategies (the strategies above are only the tip of the iceberg). The important \nquestion is which strategy is most effective and will be most liked by viewers. As a starting point, we want to \ndetermine what strategy real people use.  We have performed a first experiment to explore this.  \n3.1 Experimental design \nMethod \nSubjects were divided into two groups, experiencing different experimental conditions. In both conditions, \nsubjects were given the same individual ratings of three people, John, Adam, and Mary, for a set of video clips. \nIn seven questions, they were asked which clips the three should view as a group, given that they only had time \nto see respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 clips, and why they made that selection. The task presented to both groups \n 10\ndiffered only in that in condition 2, \"John, Mary and Adam\" had been replaced by \"John (29), Mary (32), and \ntheir grandfather Adam (81)\" (see Appendix A for exact task wordings). A between-subject design was used, as \na pilot test revealed large order effects: subjects felt compelled to change their group ratings in favor of Adam, if \nthey received condition 2 after condition 1. The individual ratings had been chosen primarily to enable \ndifferentiating between the strategies we expected subjects to use (same ratings were used as in Section 2). In \naddition, we ensured that John and Mary had quite similar ratings, while Adam\u2019s ratings were frequently the \nopposite of the ratings of the other two. We also ensured that for one clip, namely clip A, John and Mary had \nmaximal positive ratings (10), while Adam had a maximal negative rating (1). The latter would give a good idea \nof the importance subjects assigned to avoiding misery. The ratings can also be seen as representing different \nrating behavior: Adam has not used the maximum of the scale (10), while John has used it three times.   \n \nResearch questions \nWe wanted answers to the following research questions: \n\u2022 Do subjects follow a clear strategy? Is it possible to describe subjects' individual behavior in terms of a \nlogical strategy? Are the strategies discussed above being used? \n\u2022 Is there a dominant strategy? Is one strategy used by a majority of subjects, and, if so, which strategy is it? \n\u2022 Do subjects take pleasure, misery, and fairness into account? Which do they find most important? \n\u2022 Do subjects follow the rules (exhibit the desirable properties as discussed in Section 2.2)? \n\u2022 Is social standing taken into account? Does subjects' behavior change if one person in the group can be \nregarded as more important? \nWe expected the results of both experimental conditions to provide some answers to the first four questions, and \nthe difference between the conditions to provide some insight in the last question. Our hypothesis was that in \nCondition 2, Adam would be regarded as more important (because of his age), and the selections would be more \ngeared toward his taste. Note that we have deliberately chosen to make this experiment an indirect one: rather \nthan having an actual group sit down to decide what to watch, subjects were asked what they thought people \nshould watch. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, we really wanted our subjects to think about what would be \nbest for the group as a whole. Giving them a role to play (i.e. to represent John, Adam or Mary) could lead to \nthem trying to defend their own interests (even with clear instructions to consider the group as a whole). \nSecondly, as discussed in our literature review in Section 2, individuals behave differently depending on who \nelse is in the group. Some people tend to be more accommodating of others, some are more timid and others \nmore outspoken, some are better at arguing their case, or are just more respected. We did not want the eloquence \nwith which John, Mary and Adam argued their case to influence the outcomes.  \nSubjects \nThirty nine subjects participated in the experiment. All were final-year undergraduate students of the IT faculty \nattending a lecture of the Adaptive Interactive Systems module. The students were studying various courses \n(B.A. Computer and Information Systems, B.Sc. Computer Studies, B.Sc. Computer Science, and B.Sc. \nSoftware Engineering). The experiment took place in a lecture room. Subjects were assigned to experimental \ncondition depending on where they sat: the left of the room was assigned to condition 1 (18 subjects, 16 male, 2 \nfemale, average age 28, standard deviation 9.7), the right to condition 2 (21 subjects, 15 male, 6 female, average \nage 24, standard deviation 3). Students participated in the experiment voluntarily (in addition to the numbers \nmentioned above, 9 students chose not to participate). The spread over courses was similar for both conditions. \n3.2 Results and discussion \nSubjects do not seem to answer the questions independently: they responded which new clip should be added to \nthe sequence they had already chosen for the previous question. This made it possible to present the results in the \nway we have done in Tables 2 and 3 (for respectively, Condition 1 and 2), only showing the new clip selected for \neach question. However, from an experimental point of view, this is not ideal: it might have influenced their \nstrategy, making it perhaps less likely that they use the \"fair strategy\" (which only makes sense when selecting a \nlarger group of clips).  We need to explore whether the results would be different if we asked the subjects \nimmediately to select, say, six clips. A between-subject design could be used to distinguish between different set \nsizes. \n \n 11\nTable 3.

This does not necessarily mean that the subject was consciously applying this strategy. \n \nTable 3 shows the results for Condition 1, and Table 4 for Condition 2. As can be seen in the tables, subjects did \nnot always make a unique selection for a clip, sometimes they answered \"D or J\". We have tried to keep the \ntables as simple (and uncrowded) as possible: if a cell does not have a clip name in it, then the first name above \nit applies. For instance, sub11 replied F to the first question. Subjects have been ordered to make the tables as \neasy to view as possible.  The tables include information about how well the subjects' replies fit some of the \nstrategies discussed in Section 2: \n\u2022 Bold borderlines indicate replies that are in correspondence with the Average Strategy. So, for instance, all \nreplies of sub14 were the same as those by the Average Strategy. The first two replies by sub16 were the \nsame as those by the Average Strategy, but sub16\u2019s later replies differed. \n\u2022 Gray cell shading indicates replies that are in correspondence with the Least Misery Strategy. So, for \ninstance, all replies of sub11 were the same as those by the Least Misery Strategy. The first three replies by \nsub16 were the same as those by the Least Misery Strategy, but sub16\u2019s later replies differed. \n\u2022 Bold dotted borderlines indicate replies that are in correspondence with the Average Without Misery \nStrategy. So, for instance, all replies of sub2 were the same as those by the Average Without Misery \nStrategy. \n \nNote that strategies can have overlapping starts of their group lists. For instance, both the Average Strategy and \nthe Least Misery Strategy allow a start of FEHDJ. This means that cells can have both a gray cell shading and a \nbold borderline. So, for instance, sub7's replies followed the Average Strategy for the first five clips, and in \ncorrespondence with the Least Misery Strategy for the first six clips. Also, note, we have only used the Bold \ndotted borderlines, when the Average Without Misery Strategy starts deviating from the Average Strategy. \n \nDo subjects follow a clear strategy? \nThere is evidence that human subjects use the strategies mentioned above, particularly the Average Strategy, the \nAverage Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy.  \n\u2022 Average Strategy. Two subjects in Condition 1 (sub14 and 9) and five subjects in Condition 2 (SUB8, 16, \n11, 19, and 6) exactly followed the Average Strategy. Their papers tended to show additions on them. \n\u2022 Least Misery Strategy. Three subjects in Condition 1 (sub11, 10, and 5) and two subjects in Condition 2 \n(SUB12, and 10) exactly followed the Least Misery Strategy. Three subjects in Condition 1 (sub4, 7, 3) and \nthree in Condition 2 (SUB 20, 3, 4) followed the Least Misery strategy almost completely. For clip 7, three \nselected A (\"while Adam hates it, the others really like it so he will just have to put up with it\", \"Mary seems \nto lose out in most clips, so A is for her\", \"Might as well please two out of three\"), three selected I \n(\"Closest\", \"At least the majority will be satisfied\"). \n\u2022 Average Without Misery Strategy. Two subjects in Condition 1 (sub 17, 2) and three subjects in Condition 2 \n(SUB2, 14, 5) exactly followed the Average Without Misery Strategy. Three subjects used a threshold of 4 \nor 5 and two subjects (sub2, SUB5) used a threshold of 2 or 3. As expressed by one subject \"I try to please \nall of them making sure that no is lower than five\". Note that the resulting sequence for the Average Without \nMisery Strategy for a threshold of 2 or 3 coincides with Multiplicative Utilitarianism (but no signs of \nmultiplications where found on the papers). \n\u2022 Fairness Strategy. Two subjects (sub6, 13) used some kind of a Fairness Strategy. Both selected A relatively \nearly. They made comments like \"Although Adam gave 1 mark for A, he gets to see F\", \"Although some \ngave some clips low marks, they all get to see some they rated highly\". Other subjects applied fairness \ntowards the end: \"Mary 's average ratings have been low, so give her something she will enjoy\" (sub1, \nexplaining selecting A), \"Mary seems to lose out in most clips, so A is for her\" (SUB3), \"As Adam did not \nlike A, pick D next as he scored it a 9\" (SUB15). \n\u2022 Approval voting. The subjects\u2019 explanations did not show any sign of using Approval voting. Nevertheless, \nthirteen subjects\u2019 sequences fall within those permitted by Approval voting with threshold 5, and eleven \nwithin those permitted by Approval voting with threshold 6 (seven of which are in common with threshold \n5).  These seem high numbers, but it has to be taken into account that Approval voting (particularly with \nthreshold 5) did not put many restrictions on the sequences it allowed. \n\u2022 Nobody used plurality voting (in either form) and nobody used the Copeland rule. Nobody completely \nfollowed the Borda count (though two subjects\u2019 behavior on the first four items coincides with it: sub6 and \nsub13). \n \n \n 13\nIs there a dominant strategy? \nThere does not seem to be a clearly dominant strategy, but Average, Average Without Misery, and Least Misery \nare all plausible candidates for implementation. Fairness plays a role, but our human subjects did not have a clear \nstrategy for applying it. \n \nDo subjects take misery into account?  \nMany subjects take misery into account, as evidenced by the high proportion of subjects using the Least Misery \nand Average Without Misery strategies. Even subjects that do completely deviate from the Least Misery or \nAverage With Least Misery strategies, like sub12, sub15, SUB21, SUB18, SUB17, and SUB13 avoid misery: all \nleft out A and I from their selection. Therefore, preference should be given to a strategy that takes misery into \naccount. \n \nIs social standing taken into account?  \nWe did not find any statistically significant differences between the conditions. Only one subject explicitly \nmentioned age as a reason for a selection: \"A is not chosen because only the young ones like the topic\" (SUB5). \nOur intention of making Adam the most respected person did not completely succeed: one subject (SUB7) \nactually mentioned \"Adam's scores have been ignored to some extend because of age\", another (SUB21) said \n\"overall pick the average highest, if there is any difference attempt to match the two people with the same age\". \nOverall, it seems that this part of the experiment was not successful: in future we will have to make it more \nobvious that one person is socially more important (perhaps by making it their birthday). \n \nDo subjects follow the rules? \nNo, subjects sometimes exhibit completely unexpected behavior. Four subjects in Condition 1 and four in \nCondition 2 selected G (ratings 6,6,5) before D (ratings 6,9,7). This seems rather illogical, and breaks the Pareto \nrule. Two of these subjects explained using disparities in ratings as a basis for selection. This would mean that a \ngroup is happy if everybody were equally happy or miserable. Overall, ten subjects broke the Pareto rule, in \nways as shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5. Ways in which subjects broke the Pareto rule. \n B (4,9,5) \nbefore  \nD (6,9,7) \nB (4,9,5) \nbefore  \nH (8,9,6) \nG (6,6,5) \nbefore  \nD (6,9,7) \nG (6,6,5) \nbefore  \nH (8,9,6) \nG (6,6,5) \nbefore  \nJ (8,8,6) \nG (6,6,5) \nbefore  \nE (10,7,9) \nJ (8,8,6) \nbefore  \nH (8,9,6) \nsub8 x x x x x x  \nsub18   x    x \nsub16   x x   x \nsub15   x x x x x \nsub3       x \nSUB1   x     \nSUB18   x x x  x \nSUB21   x x x x x \nSUB7   x    x \nSUB17       x \n \nThe only plausible explanation seems to be that subjects thought fairness to be more important than pleasure. \nSubjects also do not follow the Condorcet winner criterion. In its stronger form, A and E were both Condorcet \nwinners, but almost all subjects started their sequence with F. This backs up our resistance against the Condorcet \nwinner criterion. \n4 Experiment 2: How people judge the sequences produced \nIn the previous experiment, we have investigated what strategies people follow and what they find important \nwhen making a decision on behalf of a group (for instance, misery, fairness, etc). However, the fact that, for \ninstance, many people used a Least Misery strategy does not necessarily mean that our television should use this \nstrategy (though it seems a reasonable option, given the results of Experiment 1). Similarly, the fact that nobody \nused the Copeland rule does not necessarily mean that the television should definitely not use that strategy. \n 14\nPerhaps that strategy was just to complex for a human to apply. In this experiment, we have turned the game \naround: instead of asking subjects to produce a satisfying sequence, we have presented subjects with sequences \nproduced by the strategies, and asked them how satisfied they would be with such a sequence. We wanted to \ndetermine which strategy produces the most satisfaction for all members of the group. To gain a better \nunderstanding of what determines an individual\u2019s satisfaction, we have also compared a number of satisfaction \nfunctions (see Section 2.4) to see which provides the best predictions.  \n4.1 Experimental design \nMethod \nSubjects were told that they were going to watch video clips with their two friends. They were given the same \nindividual ratings of three people, themselves, Friend1, and Friend2, for a set of video clips. The ratings used \nwere the same as those in Experiment 1, with John\u2019s ratings corresponding to their own, Adam\u2019s ratings to \nFriend1\u2019s, and Mary\u2019s ratings to Friend2\u2019s.4 They were told the TV had selected a sequence of clips for them, \nand were asked how satisfied they and their friends would be given that sequence, and why. This was repeated \nthree times: all subjects were given three different sequences on three pieces of paper, stapled together. (See \nAppendix B for the exact wording.)  Table 6 shows the sequences used, and the reason for using them: \n \nTable 6. Sequences used and reasons for using them. \nSequence Reason \nFEAHD Social choice according to Borda Count \nEAFID Social choice according to Copeland rule \nAEFID Social choice according to Plurality voting (one for one) \nFEHJDI Social choice according to Utilitarian multiplicative \nEFHDJB Social choice according to Average without misery \nFEHJDG Social choice according to Least misery \nAEIBDF Social choice according to Most pleasure \nEFHDJA Social choice according to Utilitarian additive \nAIEFD Social choice set according to Plurality voting and Copeland rule, but in another sequence with \nthe most negative items for Adam at the start. Together with EAFID and AEFID used to see if the \norder of the sequence influences the results. \n \nSequences have been kept as short as possible, not to overburden the experimental subjects. Some of the \nsequences are longer (6 items) than others (5 items), because they would not distinguish between voting \nstrategies otherwise. Though we used \u201cI\u201d, \u201cFriend1\u201d and \u201cFriend2\u201d in the text of the experiment, we will use \n\u201cJohn\u201d, \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d in our discussion (this makes it easier to compare between experiments).  \nNote: as before we have chosen for an indirect experiment: rather than having an actual group sit down and \nmeasure how satisfied each individual would be with a certain sequence, subjects were asked how satisfied they \nthought all members of the group would be. Measuring satisfaction would require subjects to really experience \nthe clips, and this would have required a set of clips with ratings accurately reflecting our subjects\u2019 tastes. To \ncompare multiple sequences, we either would need different groups of people with the same tastes (difficult to \nfind and control) or use a within subject design. However, order effects could have been large, as showing a clip \nmultiple times would influence its rating. \nSatisfaction functions we will use to make predictions \nWe have used six simple satisfaction functions to predict the outcomes of this experiment: \n1. Linear Addition without Normalization: The most basic satisfaction function discussed in Section 2.4, where \nthe individual\u2019s ratings of the selected items are summed.  \n2. Linear Addition with Normalization: As the previous one, but now with normalization. \n                                                          \n 15\n4 We decided to use \u201cFriend1\u201d and \u201cFriend2\u201d rather \u201cAdam\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d to avoid any influence on the subjects\u2019 \nbehavior. After all, names imply gender. It would have been better to use three male names in Experiment 1. \nThough we did not detect any influence, we decided to avoid the risk in this experiment. \n3. Quadratic Addition, Pleasure only, without Normalization: Ratings are transformed as described in Section \n2.4  (10 becomes 25, 1 becomes \u201325 etc). The individual\u2019s positive ratings of the selected items are summed. \nNegative ratings are ignored. \n4. Quadratic Addition, Pleasure only, with Normalization. \n5. Quadratic Addition, Pleasure minus Misery, without Normalization: As Quadratic Addition, Pleasure only, \nbut now the negative ratings are also incorporated in the sum.  \n6. Quadratic Addition, Pleasure minus Misery, with Normalization. \nThe differences in predictions between 1,3,5 on the one hand and 2,4,6 on the other hand will provide insight \ninto whether subjects use Normalization. The differences in predictions between 3,4 on the one hand, and 5,6 on \nthe other hand will provide insight into whether the subjects deduct misery. The differences in predictions \nbetween 1,2 on the one hand, and 3,4,5,6 will provide insight into whether subjects use the ratings as linear. \n \nWe have not used the order of the sequence as input for our satisfaction functions. We did consider adding a \nsatisfaction function that uses the sequence of the ratings: increasing the added satisfaction of an item if the \nprevious rating was high. However, we decided to leave this to future research, as we want to resolve some of \nthe other issues first, and did not know enough yet about the influence ordering could have. \n \nLinear Addition with Normalization (left) and without Normalization (right) \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIB\nDF\nEF\nHD\nJA\nJohn\nAdam\nMary\n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIB\nDF\nEF\nHD\nJA\nJohn\nAdam\nMary\n \nQuadratic Addition, Pleasure Only, with Normalization (left) and without Normalization (right) \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIB\nDF\nEF\nHD\nJA\nJohn\nAdam\nMary\n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIBD\nF\nEF\nHD\nJA\n   John\n   Adam\n   Mary\n \nQuadratic Addition, Pleasure minus Misery, with Normalization (left) and without Normalization (right) \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIBD\nF\nEF\nHD\nJA\nJohn\nAdam\nMary\n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIB\nDF\nEF\nHD\nJA\n   John\n   Adam\n   Mary\n \nFigure 1.

John and Adam quite equal without. John beats Mary \nwithout normalization, and they are quite equal with normalization. \n\u2022 Effect of deducting Misery. (Comparing the middle two graphs with the bottom two graphs). \nEFHDJA: Adam beats Mary without deduction of misery. With deduction, Mary beats Adam (or is almost \nequal to Adam, without normalization).  \n\u2022 Effect of Quadratic versus Linear. (Comparing the top two graphs with the bottom four graphs). \nFEHJDI: In Linear Addition, John and Mary are quite equal. In the others, John clearly beats Mary. \nFEHJDG: In Quadratic, Adam clearly beats Mary. In Linear, Adam and Mary are quite equal. \nEFHDJA: In Linear, Mary beats John (or is equal to John without normalization). In Quadratic, John beats \nMary. \nResearch questions \n1. Is one of our satisfaction functions a good predictor of subject behavior? The satisfaction functions above \npredict how each individual\u2019s satisfaction compares to that of the other two individuals for a particular \nsequence, as well as how it compares to their own satisfaction for other sequences. For instance, according \nto the Quadratic-Addition-Pleasure-Only satisfaction functions, John and Mary would be more satisfied with \nAIEFD than Adam, and both would prefer AIEFD to FEHJDI. The predictions of the various satisfaction \nfunctions differ, and in the experiment we can compare these predictions with the satisfactions as indicated \nby our experimental subjects. A main question was whether the predictions of one our satisfaction functions \nwould closely match those of our subjects. We also wanted answers to the following related questions, to \nbetter understand what makes a good satisfaction function: \n\u2022 Do subjects use normalization?  \n\u2022 Do subjects deduct misery?  \n\u2022 Do subjects use linear rating scales?  \nWe can use the differences in predictions as discussed above to answer these three questions.  \nIf one of the satisfaction functions is a very good predictor, then it might be possible to also determine \nthresholds. Let  s  be the predicted satisfaction of an individual with a sequence. We would like to determine \nthresholds t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5, such that: \n- s < t1: individual is very dissatisfied with the sequence (score of 1 on the scale of the experiment) \n- t1 \u2264 s < t2 : individual is dissatisfied with the sequence (score of 2 or 3 on the scale) \n- t3 \u2264 s < t4: individual is satisfied with the sequence (score of 5 or 6 on the scale) \n- t4 \u2264 s  : individual is very satisfied with the sequence (score of 7 on the scale) \nIf one of the Normalized satisfaction functions were a good predictor, then all thresholds would have to be \nbetween 0 and 1.  \n2. Does the order of the sequence influence subjects\u2019 satisfaction ratings? What aspects of order do subjects \nmention? We have given the subjects sequences of selected items, rather than sets. This allows the subjects \nto use this information if they want to. We hope that the subjects\u2019 explanations will provide us with more \ninsight into how order influences satisfaction. To study this further, we have included three experimental \nconditions (EAFID, AEFID, AIEFD) that are exactly the same, with the same set of items being selected, \nexcept that they are presented in a different order. Note that in our experiments we have deliberately \nabstracted items (A to J) instead of telling the subjects about the item content. This ensures that subjects use \nthe ratings provided rather than their own personal opinions. This has as side effect that the subjects cannot \nuse content information (the emotional tone or how the content is related to the content of other items). So, \nour experiment will be restricted to the impact of the ratings profile of a sequence on satisfaction (for \ninstance, exploring the difference between \u201c7 1 9 3 9\u201d and \u201c1 3 7 9 9\u201d), and not the emotional or content \nprofile. It might be possible to change this in a future experiment, but it is a tricky issue to handle: for \ninstance, telling subjects an item is \u2018sad\u2019 might influence their opinion of that item in isolation, not just as \npart of a sequence. \n3. Do subjects use social aspects to determine individual satisfaction? We have not used social aspects \n(solidarity or jealousy) in our satisfaction functions. Without having resolved the other issues first, it would \nhave led to an explosion in possible satisfaction functions. Even more so, as the selfishness\/sociality of our \n 17\nindividual subjects would have an impact, and different \u2018average sociality\u2019 weightings would have been \nneeded for the predictions. However, we hoped that subjects\u2019 explanations would indicate whether they had \ntaken social aspects into account. \n4. Is there one strategy (or multiple ones) that is clearly better than the others, in terms of keeping all members \nof the group happy? As subjects would indicate the satisfaction of all members of the group, we could \ninvestigate whether there is a sequence (i.e. the result of a particular selection strategy) with positive \nsatisfaction (i.e. score 5 or above) on average --or better even for all subjects-- for all members of the group. \nSubjects \nTwenty-two subjects participated in the experiment. All were academic staff of the University of Brighton. \nSubjects were assigned to experimental condition at random. To control for order effects, each sequence \nappeared similarly often as first, second and third paper. Permutated sequences AIEFD, AEFID, and EAFID \nwere not given to the same subjects, so, there was a complete between-subjects design for those. Each sequence \nwas studied by at least seven subjects (some by eight). \n4.2 Results and discussion \nFigure 2 shows the average satisfaction scores per condition.  \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nFE\nAH\nD\nAI\nEF\nD\nAE\nFID\nEA\nFID\nFE\nHJ\nDI\nEF\nHD\nJB\nFE\nHJ\nDG\nAE\nIB\nDF\nEF\nHD\nJA\nJohn\nAdam\nMary\n \nFigure 2. Average satisfaction scores per condition. \nDo subjects use normalization? \nComparing the results with the prominent differences between the predictions of the satisfaction functions (see \nSection 4.1), we find: \n\u2022 FEAHD: There is a trend that Mary beats John, as predicted by normalization. This is not statistically \nsignificant, but \u201cwithout normalization\u201d predicted John to beat Mary. \n\u2022 AIEFD, AEIBDF:  John and Mary are quite equal, which is more in tune with normalization. \n\u2022 EFHDJB: Mary and John almost equal, as predicted by normalization. \n\u2022 FEHJDG: There is a trend that Adam beats John, as predicted by normalization, but this is not statistically \nsignificant. However, John clearly beats Mary, as predicted by \u201cwithout normalization\u201d (this is statistically \nsignificant, p<0.01). \nSo, overall, there is some evidence that normalization has taken place, but with a contradictory result for \nFEHJDG (which is a strange case, as will be discussed below).  \nDo subjects deduct misery? \nComparing the results with the predictions of the satisfaction functions (see Section 4.1), we find: \n\u2022 EFHDJA: There is a trend that Mary beats Adam as predicted by deducting misery. This is not statistically \nsignificant, but without deducting misery it was predicted that Adam beats Mary. \n 18\nSo, there is some evidence that misery is taken into account (deducted). This is in line with the results of \nExperiment 1. \nDo subjects use linear rating scales? \nComparing the results with the predictions of the satisfaction functions (see Section 4.1), we find: \n\u2022 FEHJDI: John beats Mary, as predicted by Quadratic. This is statistically significant (p<0.01). \n\u2022 FEHJDG: Adam clearly beats Mary, as predicted by Quadratic. This is statistically significant (p<0.001) \nSo, there is clear evidence that Quadratic is a better measure than Linear.  \nDoes the order of the sequence influence satisfaction? \nOrder is mentioned by six subjects: \n\u2022 One subject (S22) mentioned that the first clip mainly influenced his ratings. Another subject (S3) explained \na low rating for Adam in AIEFD: \u201chad to endure his two least favorite clips. Then he gave up and went \naway.\u201d \n\u2022 One subject (S20) considered how the individuals\u2019 experience changed over time. For FEHJDH he mentions \nthe problem of John feeling a decline of \u201cquality\u201d from the second clip onwards. He also mentioned that \nJohn would be quite satisfied with EFHDJA \u201cending in a high\u201d (in addition to seeing good clips). In support \nof this, another subject explained a low satisfaction of Adam with EFHDJA by \u201cnever finish on a bad one\u201d \n(S7). A third subject (S18) shared this interest in the end of the sequence: she mentioned that Adam and \nMary would be more satisfied than John with FEAHD (contrary to general belief) because they get more \nfavorite clips towards the end. She also gave John a low rating (3) for EFHDJA because she assumed it to be \nboring to see too many favorites in a row! \n\u2022 One subject (S13) explicitly indicated not having taken order into account. \nNo statistically significant differences were found between the results of EAFID, AEFID, and AIEFD. This is \nnot surprising given the small number of subjects who mentioned order. Most subjects treated the sequences as \nsets. The ordering issue will need to be studied further in future experiments, particularly investigating the \nimpact of the start of the sequence, the end, and the increase or decrease of pleasure over time. \nDo subjects use social aspects to determine individual satisfaction? \nMost subjects did not explicitly do so. \n\u2022 Only three subjects (S15, S12, and S11) mentioned taking the mood of the others into account when \ndetermining the satisfaction of an individual. Another subject (S16) mentioned \u201cIf satisfaction depends on \nothers being satisfied I could not assess this, because there was too much to hold in short-term memory. I \nhad no overall model of the situation, and merely did the three evaluations independently.\u201d  \n\u2022 One of these subjects (S11) mentioned that it would be important to know more about the context: \u201cif \nwatching at your own house, your visitors\u2019 satisfaction becomes more important\u201d.  \nIs one of the satisfaction functions a good predictor? \nComparing the average profile above with the profile of the normalized \u201cQuadratic Addition, Pleasure minus \nMisery\u201d satisfaction function, it can be concluded that they are quite similar. There are, however, still a number \nof noticeable differences: \n\u2022 Adam\u2019s satisfaction for AIEFD (and its permutations) is low, but not as low as predicted. Similarly, Adam\u2019s \nsatisfaction for AEIBDF is higher than expected. Perhaps the numbers associated with low ratings (like \u201325 \nfor a rating of 1) should be less negative than we have them. So, deducting misery, but less severely. \n\u2022 The difference between John\u2019s and Mary\u2019s satisfaction for FEHJDG is larger than expected. Comparing \nMary\u2019s satisfaction for FEHJDG with that for EFHDJB shows a significant difference (p<0.05). This is \nstrange as the only difference between both sequences (except order) is the G in one sequence and the B in \nthe other, both of which have the same rating for Mary. Perhaps subjects did take a social aspect into \naccount: preferring B (which at least gives pleasure to Adam) to G (which gives pleasure to nobody), and \nfeeling more upset about missing favorite A because G pleases nobody. Many subjects mention missing A \nas the reason for giving a low mark. \n\u2022 John\u2019s satisfaction for EFHDJA is lower than expected (compared to Adam\u2019s and Mary\u2019s satisfaction). This \nmight be partly caused by the somewhat odd behavior of subject S18 (See order section above). Another \nsubject mentioned giving John a low rating (3) because of missing out on one of his favorites (I). \n 19\n\u2022 The last two points (and the frequency with which subjects used the argument of missing the favorite for \ngiving a lower mark) indicates that a higher weight has to be given to favorites, such that satisfaction goes \ndown when all favorites are missed.  \nThese differences have made it impossible to determine thresholds. \nIs there a strategy that keeps everyone happy? \nOn average, John, Adam and Mary were all reported to be not dissatisfied with FEAHD (Borda Count), FEHJDI \n(Multiplicative Utilitarian), EFHDJB (Average without Misery), AEIBDF (Most pleasure) and EFHDJA \n(Additive Utilitarian). Looking at individual subjects\u2019 responses, FEHJDI (Multiplicative Utilitarian) is the only \nsequence that has ratings of at least 4 for all subjects for all individuals. The average ratings for this sequence are \neven above 5 for John, Adam, and Mary, showing a certain degree of satisfaction for all of them. So, \nMultiplicative Utilitarian seems the most promising strategy, but the others are not bad either. Of course, we \nneed to investigate this issue further, using different individual ratings and different lengths of the sequence. \nHowever, on the basis of this experiment, we can reduce the number of strategies to be investigated (discarding \nCopeland rule, Plurality voting, Least misery).  \nOther issues \n\u2022 One subject mentioned that the length of the clips would be important. (S19) This is a valid point, as \nviewing something you hate for five minutes or an hour would indeed make a big difference.  \n\u2022 One subject mentioned that other factors would influence satisfaction, like the discussion on the basis of the \nclips (S18). \n\u2022 Almost all subjects talked about including (or not having included) the favorite clip(s). This seemed to be a \nmore important issue than expected.  \n5 Algorithms for presenting a sequence: the issues of order and ratings \nUntil now we have focused on how a set of items suitable for a group can be selected based on the individuals\u2019 \nratings.  The television will also need to decide in which order to show the items. In this section, we will sketch \nthree algorithms that take ordering issues into account, and we will empirically explore the assumptions \nunderlying these algorithms. \n5.1 Algorithms \nAlgorithm 1: Using the group list ranking \nAs the selection strategies described produce a ranked group list, the simplest algorithm is to show the items in \nthe same order as they appear in the list. We have applied this method when producing the sequences for \nExperiment 2. The algorithm is depicted in Figure 3. Note that this algorithm might need to be slightly modified \nif the time durations of items vary. Television programmes (such as the news) tend to have a fixed length. Items, \non the other hand, could have varying lengths, with one item being longer than another. It is possible that at the \nend of the sequence an item lower in the group list ranking needs to be selected to fill the available time, as the \nitem which turn it was might be too long. \n \n \nRemove item \nfrom list \nShow first \nitem of list Time left \nDetermine  \nGroup List \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Algorithm for deciding sequence using group list ranking. \n \nAlgorithm 2: Changing order \nUsing the group list ranking to determine the order will produce a sequence with items liked by the group at the \nstart and a decline in quality afterwards. However, this might not be the best order for keeping everybody \n 20\noptimally satisfied. As indicated in Section 2.2 we believe that a good sequence should keep each individual\u2019s \nsatisfaction above a threshold at each moment during the broadcast. Our example in that section already showed \nthat the order of the items impacts whether or not a sequence meets this criterion. Comments made by some \nsubjects in the previous experiment show that there might be additional aspects that decide how good a sequence \nis, like having a strong ending. As discussed in Section 2.5, it is also likely that the mood induced by watching an \nitem and the topic of an item influences what is the best item to show next.  So, instead of showing items in the \norder of the group list, a more advanced algorithm could merely use the group list to decide which set of items to \nshow and then order this set taking certain constraints into account (see Figure 4). For instance, it could order the \nset such that the sequence \n\u2022 Keeps individuals sufficiently satisfied throughout the broadcast: the predicted satisfaction of each \nindividual at each point in the sequence is above a certain threshold \n\u2022 Has a strong ending: The predicted satisfaction of each individual with the last M items is above a certain \nthreshold  \n\u2022 Exhibits consistency in mood: The predicted mood induced by each two adjacent items in not \u201ctoo wide \napart\u201d on a mood scale. For instance, it might be fine to succeed a \u201cVery Happy\u201d item with a \u201cHappy\u201d item, \nbut not with a \u201cVery Sad\u201d item.   \n\u2022 Has a good narrative flow: Topically related items are as close as possible in the sequence.  \nNote that these constraints are both speculative and vague. Though they might seem reasonable, we have not \nproven yet that they are, and we have not specified them in detail (for instance, how far apart are two adjacent \nitems allowed to be on the mood scale, what is the value of M, etc.). Also, the constraints could conflict: two \nitems can be highly topically related but induce widely different moods. Additionally, the television will need \ninformation about the mood and topicality of the items to be able to use them for ordering. This requires either \nexplicit annotation (rather unlikely to happen for small television items), or an inference mechanism based on \nwhat is known about the item. The main source of information about items will be their subtitles, complemented \nby the audio and video signal.  We expect that it might be possible to automatically estimate the mood of an item \nbased on an analysis of its subtitles (e.g. looking for words like murder, disaster, dead, etc) and the tone of voice \nof the people in the video. Topical relatedness could perhaps be estimated by comparing the frequencies of (non-\ncommon) words in the subtitles. In the experiment below we will explore our assumptions that mood and topical \nrelatedness should have an impact on the order. The practical issue of how to automatically determine the mood \nor topicality is beyond the topic of this paper.  \n \n \nDetermine order \nto show items in \nDetermine top N \nitems to show \nShow items in \nthis order \nDetermine  \nGroup List \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Algorithm for deciding sequence using ordering constraints. \n \n \nAlgorithm 3: Changing ratings  \nThere seems to be one major flaw in the reasoning above: until now we have tacitly assumed that we can first \nselect a set of items and then order them, ignoring that ratings might change as an effect of viewing an item. \nHaving shown an item to the group, issues like mood consistency and topical relatedness might well lead to an \nitem outside the selected set being more suitable to show next than the items in our selected set.  We believe that \nthe individuals\u2019 ratings should be recalculated taking into account the items they have seen so far. This leads to \nthe algorithm depicted in Figure 5. Different rules could be used for the recalculation of ratings, and the \nfollowing are some speculative examples: \n\u2022 If an item is topically related to the item shown, then increase its rating (by an amount proportionate to the \nrelatedness). \n\u2022 If an item has the same mood as the item shown, then increase it\u2019s rating, and decrease the rating if the \nmoods conflict (by an amount proportionate with the intensity of the mood). A question is whether changes \nin ratings need to apply only for the duration of the next selection or for longer. For instance, suppose the \nTV shows a \u201cvery sad\u201d item. This might lead to a reduction in ratings for \u201chappy\u201d items. If the TV were to \nshow a \u201cneutral\u201d item next, should the ratings for the \u201chappy\u201d items be restored to their previous value, or \nremain reduced?  \n 21\n\u2022 If the (predicted) viewer\u2019s satisfaction is high after watching the items so far, then increase ratings, and if \nthe (predicted) satisfaction is low then decrease ratings. To give an example of how this might work: \nAssume Adam is shown a number of items he likes. This gives him high satisfaction. Because of this, his \nratings for other items (like the ones he normally hates) will increase. This makes it more likely these items \nwill be selected (for instance, by passing the threshold in an Average Without Misery strategy). Assume as a \nconsequence an item he normally hates is shown, like item A. This reduces his satisfaction and therefore his \nratings for other items, making it more likely he will see something he enjoys soon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUpdate \nRatings \nShow first \nitem of list \nDetermine  \nGroup List Time left \n \nFigure 5. Algorithm for deciding sequence using rating modification. \n \nNote that this algorithm allows items to be shown multiple times. This can be counteracted by sharply decreasing \nthe rating of items that have been shown, or by adding a constraint to the \u201cShow first item of the list\u201d that it has \nto be the first item not already shown. Whilst showing a news item multiple times needs to be avoided, this \nmight not be equally true for all types of programmes and viewers. Toddlers, for instance, very happily watch \nsomething they like multiple times. Similarly, a music clip might warrant watching multiple times for a fan. It \nseems therefore best to leave this issue to be dealt with by the sub-algorithm that determines each individual\u2019s \nratings.  \n \nTo investigate whether this algorithm is indeed better than the other two algorithms discussed, our next step is to \nexplore if people do indeed adjust their ratings. More particularly, we would also like to gain insight into the \neffects of mood, satisfaction, and topical relatedness on the ratings of items after having viewed another item.  \n5.2 Experimental design \nMethod \nSubjects were told that they were going to watch the evening news, and that the television would select a \nsequence of news items for them. They were asked to rate seven news items on how much they would want to \nwatch them and how they might expect the news item to make them feel. After they had rated all seven items, \nsubjects were told what the first item on the news was, an item that they had not yet seen. They were asked to \nrate this first item on how much they would want to watch it and how they might expect the item to make them \nfeel.  Next, they were asked to rate the other seven news items again, given that they had just watched that first \nitem. There were two experimental conditions. In Condition A, the first news item was \u201cBrighton University \nWatts Building on Fire: hundreds feared dead\u201d. In Condition B, it was \u201cEngland football team has to play \nBulgaria in the next round\u201d. (See Appendix C for the exact wording.)  Table 7 shows the news items used, and \nthe reason for using them. \n \nResearch questions \nWe wanted answers to the following research questions: \n\u2022 Do people adjust ratings? Does having watched the first news item influence the ratings for the other news \nitems? If this is the case, then a new group list will have to be determined after each presented item, as in \nAlgorithm 3 of the previous section. If the ratings stay the same, then we could apply an ordering algorithm \nto the group list, as in Algorithm 2 of the previous section. Our hypothesis was that in both conditions the \nratings would change. \n\u2022 Does mood influence the way ratings are adjusted? Condition A was constructed to test this. We expected \nall subjects to feel very sad after viewing the \u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: hundreds feared \ndead\u201d item. Our hypothesis was that this would influence their ratings, particularly of items of a conflicting \n(\u201chappy\u201d) mood, such as the \u201c[Insert name of your favorite sport\u2019s club] wins important game\u201d item. \n\u2022 Does topical relatedness influence the way ratings are adjusted? Does having watched the first news item \ninfluence the ratings of topically related items to a higher extent than the ratings of topically unrelated \nitems? Condition B was constructed to test this. Our hypothesis was that after watching the \u201cEngland \nfootball team has to play Bulgaria in the next round\u201d item, subjects would change their ratings for the \u201cMain \n 22\nthree Bulgarian players injured after Bulgaria-Spain football match\u201d item, and, to a lesser extent, for the \n\u201cEarthquake hits Bulgaria\u201d item. \n\u2022 Does the subject\u2019s satisfaction influence the way ratings are adjusted? Does a subject with a high rating for \nthe first item increase the ratings of the other items? Does a subject with a low rating for the first item \ndecrease the ratings of the other items? We can only test this on items that are topically unrelated and in the \nsame mood (or these aspects might cause a change). Our hypothesis was that the rating for the \u201cEarthquake \nhits Bulgaria\u201d item would increase after having seen the \u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: \nhundreds feared dead\u201d item, as both are sad items, topically unrelated, and the \u201con fire\u201d item is expected to \nhave a high interest rating.  \n\u2022 Is there an interaction between these factors? Is there an interaction between the subject\u2019s satisfaction of an \nitem and the effect of topical relatedness on ratings for other items? Our hypothesis is that subjects who \nexpress an interest in the \u201cEngland football team has to play Bulgaria in the next round\u201d item are more \nlikely to increase the rating of the topically related \u201cMain three Bulgarian players injured after Bulgaria-\nSpain football match\u201d item than subjects who were not interested.  \n \nTable 7. News items used and reasons for using them. \nNews item Reason \n\u201c[Insert name of your favorite sport\u2019s club] wins \nimportant game\u201d \nExpect that most subjects would want to see this item \nand that it would make them feel very happy.   \n\u201cFleet of limos for Jennifer Lopez 100-metre trip\u201d5 This item and the next two were real news items that \nwere chosen to be not topically related to the \u201cEngland \nfootball team has to play Bulgaria in the next round\u201d \nand \u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: \nhundreds feared dead\u201d items.  \n\u201cHeart disease could be halved\u201d5 Expect that it would make most subjects happy. \n\u201cIs there room for God in Europe?\u201d5 Expect that subjects would differ in opinion. \n\u201cEarthquake hits Bulgaria\u201d Expect that most subjects would want to see this item \nand that it would make them feel sad. Also picked \n\u201cBulgaria\u201d to make this item weakly topically related \nto the \u201cEngland football team has to play Bulgaria in \nnext match\u201d item.  \n\u201cUK fire strike continues\u201d Expect that most subjects would not want to see this \nitem at the start. The UK fire strike had already been in \nthe news for months.

We therefore expected them to be both very \ninterested in and very sad about this item. Constructed \nto investigate the effect of mood. \n\u201cEngland football team has to play Bulgaria in the \nnext round\u201d (only in Condition B) \nTopically related to two other items, with a different \ndegree of relatedness. Constructed to investigate the \neffect of topical relatedness. \nSubjects \nThirty-four subjects participated in the experiment. All were final-year undergraduate students of the IT faculty \nattending a lecture of the Adaptive Interactive Systems module6. The students were studying various courses \n(B.A. Computer and Information Systems, B.Sc. Computer Studies, B.Sc. Computer Science, and B.Sc. \n                                                          \n5 These news headlines were taken from the Yahoo news site http:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/ on 28-2-2003. \n 23\n6 Note: this experiment took place almost a year after Experiment 1, so none of these subjects had participated \nbefore. \nSoftware Engineering). The experiment took place in a lecture room. Subjects were randomly assigned to an \nexperimental condition. Students participated in the experiment voluntarily (in addition to the numbers \nmentioned above, two students chose not to participate). The spread over courses was similar for both \nconditions. \n5.3 Experimental results and discussion \nInfluence of viewing an item on ratings for other items \nThe results for Condition A (\u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: hundreds feared dead\u201d) clearly \nconfirm our hypothesis that there can be a large influence of viewing an item on the ratings of other items. \nFigure 6 shows a dramatic decrease in ratings after seeing this item. All subjects modified at least one rating, and \nthe difference in ratings was statistically significant. We can therefore conclude that Algorithm 3 is the best \ncandidate.  \n \nMean (St.Dev)  \nNews item Before After \nWins Game  4.71 (1.99) 3.65 (2.18) \nLopez  3.18 (1.78) 2.47 (1.74) \nHeart Disease  5.53 (1.07) 4.76 (1.39) \nGod   3.94 (1.89) 3.06 (1.78) \nEarthquake  5.47 (1.28) 4.00 (1.41) \nFire Strike  4.71 (1.26) 3.65 (1.37) \nPlayer Injury  2.41 (1.42) 2.00 (1.37) \nNews Item\nW\nin\ns \nG\nam\ne\nLo\npe\nz\nP\nla\nye\nr I\nnj\nur\ny\nH\nea\nrt \nD\nis\nea\nse\nG\nod\nFi\nre\n S\ntri\nke\nE\nar\nth\nqu\nak\ne\nR\nat\nin\ng 8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nBefore\nAfter\n   \nFigure 6.Box plot and summary table for Condition A showing the mean, standard deviation, median, and \nquartiles, and outliers (circles) of the subjects\u2019 ratings for the various news items before and after seeing the \n\u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: hundreds feared dead\u201d item. \n \nInfluence of mood \nThe results for Condition A (\u201cBrighton University Watts Building on Fire: hundreds feared dead\u201d) were hoped to \nshed some light on the influence of mood. We clearly succeeded in producing an item that made all subjects \nexpect to feel sad.  All subjects chose \u201cvery sad\u201d, with the exception of two who chose the category just above \nthat. However, we probably succeeded too well: subjects were expecting to be sad to the extent that most \ndecreased their ratings across the board. Some subjects expressed this by making comments like \u201cI would not be \ninterested to see anything anymore, when worried about friends dying\u201d. This does confirm our hypothesis that \nmood can influence ratings, but not our more particular hypothesis about the way it would affect them. We did \nnot find that the ratings of happy items decreased more than those of sad items. On the contrary, the Heart \nDisease item (judged by subjects as making them happy) showed a smaller decrease than the sad Earthquake \nitem. So, contrary to our hypothesis and the literature described in Section 2, it might be that subjects actually \nprefer a happy item to distract them from the sad news. Subjects\u2019 comments also indicate that there is more to \nitems than mood and topic: namely, an importance dimension. Subjects commented that after seeing the \nBrighton University On Fire item, they were no longer in the mood for irrelevant items, such as the Wins Game \nand Lopez items. \n \n 24\nWe also did a small pilot test using an \u2013as we thought- positive mood inducing item \u201cWar avoided by \nnegotiation\u201d. This proved problematic: our pilot subjects varied in opinion on how happy this item would make \nthem feel. Their comments show that this was due to the subjects\u2019 opinion on the desirability of avoiding a war \nin Iraq. Note that we never specified which war was supposedly avoided. This shows the difficulty in \nconstructing items with a certain fixed mood or interest.  \n \nInfluence of satisfaction \nWe could not draw any conclusions about the influence of satisfaction from the \u201cEarthquake in Bulgaria\u201d item in \nCondition A, because the \u201cUniversity on Fire\u201d item had had the unexpected effect of changing all ratings. Also, \nno effect was found in Condition B. Therefore, we have not found any proof to support the recalculation of \nratings dependent on the rating of the previous item. However, we need still to investigate whether satisfaction \nwould have an influence if there were no other influencing factors (like mood and topical relatedness). It might \nalso be that the influence of satisfaction is not a conscious influence, one that people are aware of, and that a \nmore realistic experiment in which subjects were really viewing video clips is needed.    \n \nInfluence of topical relatedness \nThe results for Condition B (\u201cEngland football team has to play Bulgaria in the next round\u201d) confirm our \nhypothesis that viewing an item can influence the ratings of topically related items. Figure 7 shows that subjects \nincreased the ratings of the topically related items, while the ratings of the topically unrelated items remained \nsimilar (actually, the means even show a small decline in ratings for these items). The strongly topically related \n\u201cMain three Bulgarian players injured after Bulgaria-Spain football match\u201d also showed a larger change in \nratings than the weakly related \u201cEarthquake hits Bulgaria\u201d. \n \nMean (St.Dev)  \nNews item Before After \nWins Game 5.06 (1.92) 5.18(1.70) \nLopez 2.47 (1.51) 2.29 (1.40) \nHeart Disease 5.76 (.97) 5.59 (1.06) \nGod  3.47 (1.81) 3.47 (1.66) \nEarthquake 4.76 (1.52) 4.88 (1.36) \nFire Strike 4.47 (1.59) 4.41 (1.66) \nPlayer Injury 3.76 (1.44) 4.18 (1.63) \nNews Item\nW\nin\ns \nG\nam\ne\nLo\npe\ns\nPl\nay\ner\n In\nju\nry\nH\nea\nrt \nD\nis\nea\nse\nG\nod\nFi\nre\n S\ntri\nke\nEa\nrth\n Q\nua\nke\nR\nat\nin\ng 8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nBefore\nAfter\n   \nFigure 7.Box plot and summary table for Condition B showing the mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, \nand outliers (circles) of the subjects\u2019 ratings for the various news items before and after seeing the \u201cEngland \nfootball team has to play Bulgaria in the next round\u201d item. \n \nInteraction between satisfaction and the effect of topical relatedness \nWe expected the effect of topical relatedness to depend on the interest the subject had for the item they viewed. \nFor instance, if a subject were completely uninterested in the English football team, then we would not expect an \neffect on their ratings for the related \u201cMain three Bulgarian players injured after Bulgaria-Spain football match\u201d. \nOn the contrary, if a subject were very interested in the English football team, then we would expect their ratings \nfor the related item to go up.

In this paper, we have defined the problems associated with adaptation to groups, \ndescribed our initial research in this area, discovered some answers and many more questions that need \nanswering.  \n6.1 Conclusions from the study \nThe main results from this study are: \nPeople use some of the choice strategies described in Section 2, such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. \nAdditive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about \nfairness and avoiding individual misery. (Experiment 1) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nPeople use normalization: their satisfaction does not only depend on the selected items, but also on the not \nselected ones. (Experiment 2) \nPeople deduct misery: their satisfaction is negatively affected by disagreeable experiences, more than \nbecause of losing out on possible pleasure. (Experiment 2) \nPeople use the ratings in a non-linear way: i.e. the difference in ratings between say 9 and 10 is regarded as \nlarger than that between 7 and 8. (Experiment 2)  \nThe \u201cNormalized Quadratic Addition, Pleasure minus Misery\u201d satisfaction functions produced reasonable, \nthough not completely correct predictions. (Experiment 2) \nThe sequences produced by five choice strategies (Borda Count, Multiplicative Utilitarian, Average without \nMisery, Most pleasure, and Additive Utilitarian) gave, in our example, on avarage satisfaction to all \nindividuals in the group. (Experiment 2) \nMultiplicative Utilitarian seems the best strategies as it\u2019s sequence produced satisfaction for all individuals \nin the group according to all subjects. (Experiment 2)  \nPeople\u2019s opinion about items can change dramatically as a result of watching another item. Hence, ratings \nneed to be recalculated after showing each item, and a new Group list needs to be determined before \nselecting the next item. (Experiment 3) \n 26\nPeople\u2019s opinion about items can change as a result of the mood induced by watching an item. Watching a \nvery sad item can decrease the ratings for other items. Contrary to expectation, it does not seem to decrease \nthe ratings of conflicting mood items more than those of similar mood. (Experiment 3) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nPeople\u2019s opinion about items can change as a result of their topical relatedness to a shown item. There is a \ntrend towards an interaction with Satisfaction: if the person is interested in the shown item, than the ratings \nof topically related items are more likely to increase. (Experiment 3) \n6.2 Limitations of the study \nIndirectness of the experiments  \nAs discussed in Sections 3 and 4, we have deliberately chosen to make the experiments indirect. In Experiment \n1, rather than having an actual group sit down to decide what to watch, subjects were asked what they thought \npeople should watch. In Experiment 2, rather than having an actual group sit down and measure how satisfied \neach individual would be with a certain sequence, subjects were asked how satisfied they thought all members of \nthe group would be. In Experiment 3, real news headings were used for items, rather than the abstract items used \nin the earlier experiments. But again, we did not really show the items to the subjects, but asked them how much \nthey wanted to see them and how they expected viewing them would make them feel. We explained the reasons \nfor this indirect approach in Sections 3 and 4, and they mainly had to do with controlling the experiment. \nHowever, as always, the more an experiment is controlled, the less it resembles the real world.   \n \nSubjects used in the experiments \nThe sets of subjects were quite homogeneous, particularly the level of education: either having or studying for a \ndegree, mostly in computing. Subjects were also from a relatively narrow age range (though not as narrow as the \nword \u201cstudent\u201d suggests, as we have a large proportion of mature students), and the majority of subjects in \nExperiments 1 and 3 were male. This raises some doubts about the generalisability of the results, as the \ndemographic of a television audience is a lot more heterogeneous. However, as the indirectness of our \nexperiments did require a certain level of education, it would have been impossible to use a cross section of the \npopulation. This would also have required a rather large group of subjects. Nevertheless, the generalisability of \nthe results remains to be proven.   \n \nExample used in the experiments \nIn both Experiments1 and 2, we have used the example of a group of three people, with particular ratings for \nthese three people. It still needs to be proven that our result about the suitability of the strategies is generalisable \nto larger groups, and different rating distributions.  \n \nAssumptions made \nAs discussed in Section 2, we have made a number of assumptions. In a sense, all of them are limitations of this \nstudy. The most important limitation seems our assumption that ratings are accurate: recommender systems need \nto be able to deal with uncertainty. This might mean that rather than having an accurate rating for an individual \nfor an item, we might have a probability distribution that indicates the likelihood of certain ratings for that item. \nOr it might mean that we have an estimated rating with an indication of how certain the system is about its \nestimation. Taking uncertainty into account would have made our experiments far more complicated. We had, \ntherefore, decided to separate concerns, and start with the assumption that ratings were accurate. We believe that \nmost results \u2013in the sense of what is important to people, like avoiding misery- would still hold when dealing \nwith uncertainty, but that an additional set of rules would apply in that case.  \n6.3 Areas for further work \nOur research has only just started, and raises many questions that warrant further research. For example: \nThe Multiplicative Utilitarian strategy seems a good strategy to use, but more experiments are needed to \nconfirm this. These experiments would need to deal with the limitations mentioned above. \nOne way to reduce the effort involved in empirical evaluations would be to have a good Satisfaction \nFunction to predict experimental results. The \u201cNormalized Quadratic Addition, Pleasure minus Misery\u201d \nsatisfaction function is a promising start, but needs further improvement to become more accurate.  \n 27\nFinding a highly accurate Satisfaction Function would also allow us to mathematically determine the \noptimal strategy.  \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nThe ordering of the sequence requires more investigation. This is not only a group adaptation issue, but \napplies also when dealing with only one viewer. We need to determine what exactly the effect of mood is, \nhow to correctly predict the size of the effect of topical relatedness on ratings, and how to deal with the \nimportance dimension. On a more practical level, we need to investigate how mood, topicality, and \nimportance can be automatically detected based on subtitles, audio, and video.  \nInvisible members can be added to a group (to represent teachers, or parents) to ensure that a viewer\u2019s \n(student or child) overall viewing experience is more appropriate. It should be investigated how this can be \ndone and can be made both acceptable and beneficial for the viewer. Similarly, television critics could be \nadded as members of a group. Their ratings would accurately reflect their opinions.  \nAn individual\u2019s satisfaction might be influenced by adequate user interface design. For instance, when \nshowing an item, it could be indicated to the viewers what the next item(s) will be (for instance, using a \nsubtitle). This tells viewers who do not like the current item that the next one will be to their taste. This \nmight avoid dissatisfaction, boredom, and walking away from the television. \nAcknowledgements \nThe author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions and comments which \naided in improving the article, and the Nuffield Foundation for support via grant NAL\/00258\/G. \nReferences \nArdissono, L. and Buczak, A.
