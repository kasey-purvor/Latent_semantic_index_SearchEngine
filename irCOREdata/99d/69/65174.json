INTRODUCTION\nOVER THE last 40 years, there has been an increasedapplication of wind turbines (WTs) around the world,\nwith growth in rating from 30 kW to > 5 MW and, more\nrecently, their application offshore [1]. To reduce the cost of\nenergy from WTs, there is a pressing need to improve the WT\navailability and reduce the operational and maintenance (O&M)\n0278-0046\/$26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Variation in power output from a 33-kW fixed-speed WT over five\nsuccessive periods of 900 s, each showing the large variation in the signal due\nto wind turbulence (taken from [7]).\ncosts. Aside from developing more advanced machine designs\n[2] to improve the availability, an effective way to achieve\nthis improvement would be to apply reliable and cost-effective\ncondition monitoring [3], which is why this subject is attracting\nindustrial and academic attention.\nThe wind industry currently uses condition monitoring sys-\ntems (CMSs), such as vibration, temperature, lubrication oil,\nand generator current analysis, developed from other rotating\nmachine power generation industries [4]\u2013[6], where they have\nachieved success. However, despite their application in the\nwind industry [7], they have not yet proven their effectiveness\ndue to the peculiarities of a WT, which has a slow speed and\nrapidly varying torque. Commercial WT CMSs mostly employ\nvibration-based techniques, which are sophisticated, and the\nsensors and cabling are costly. The technique is also not ideally\nsuited to all WT types and faults. Lubrication oil analysis is\nbecoming more popular for detecting gearbox tooth and bearing\nwear but cannot detect failures outside the gearbox. More\nadvanced techniques, such as optical strain measurement, have\nbeen developed for monitoring WT blade integrity. However,\nthese are expensive, and recent reliability surveys [8] have\nshown that WT electrical systems have a higher failure rate than\nthe mechanical systems. For these reasons, an electrically based\nWT CMS would be beneficial and could be more comprehen-\nsive, simpler, and cheaper than other techniques. This paper will\npropose such a technique.\nInstantaneous electric power measurement has been demon-\nstrated on induction machines for detecting motor faults [9].\nThree-phase total power monitoring has also been applied to\nWTs as a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis signal [10]\nbut has not achieved commercial application. This research will\nbe based entirely on the use of this signal and the generator\nspeed for condition monitoring. Power output measurement\nwas considered for condition monitoring in [7] and [10], but\nFig. 1, taken from [7], shows how the WT power output signal\nexperiences continuous and rapid variations during operation.\nThe work reported in this paper is an enhancement of the\nresearch described in [11], now including the following:\n1) a more comprehensive description of the background\ntechnology and the state of the art of the proposed\ntechnique;\n2) an improved mathematical presentation;\n3) additional figures to enhance the description of the\ntechnique;\n4) more substantial experimental results;\n5) an amended conclusion.\nFig. 2. Structures of real large WTs. (a) Geared. (b) Direct drive.\nThe novelties of the proposed technique are summarized as\nfollows:\n1) a technique for WT condition monitoring based on mea-\nsuring the generator total power signal rather than more\nconventional measurements validated by experiments on\na test rig with a simple fault setup;\n2) a new adaptive continuous-wavelet-transform (CWT)-\nbased energy tracking method, reducing the calculation\ntime for feature extraction when applied to lengthy sig-\nnals, making possible less time-intensive WT condition\nmonitoring;\n3) the successful detection of two types of fault using this\nmethod has been demonstrated on two WT arrangements,\nincluding both electrical and mechanical faults;\n4) the proposed method is more efficient for the detection\nof faults in variable-speed WTs than other more conven-\ntional techniques;\n5) the technique used in this paper can be applied to any WT\ngenerator for tracking any characteristic, fault-related fre-\nquency component, so it is general and could be applied\nto detect a variety of faults depending on the choice of\nfrequency selected.\nWavelet transforms have been successfully used in condition\nmonitoring and diagnosis of rotating electrical machine faults\n[1], [12]\u2013[14]. However, most used the discrete wavelet trans-\nform (DWT) rather than the CWT, although the latter is superior\nto the former in multiresolution signal analysis. However, the\nCWT involves more intensive convolution calculations than the\nDWT, making it more difficult to process lengthy online data,\nsuch as WT monitoring signals. Moreover, it is inconvenient to\napply the traditional time\u2013frequency\u2013amplitude CWT image to\nmachine condition monitoring, as was done in [15]. Wavelets\nhave been proposed for WT condition monitoring [16], [17] but\nhave not yet received commercial application.\nII. APPLYING GENERATOR POWER MONITORING TO WTs\nA WT converts the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical\nenergy, utilizing mechanical and electrical conversion, control,\nand transmission systems. The architectures of two commonly\nused large WTs are shown in Fig. 2.\nThe application of vibration, temperature, and lubrication oil\ntechniques to monitoring WTs should improve their availability\nbut, to date, is not being widely used for the following reasons:\n1) lack of practical industry experience with condition mon-\nitoring in the wind environment;\n2) difficulties collecting and interpreting the data, including\nthe risk of false or missed alarms;\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham. Downloaded on April 09,2010 at 13:54:59 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nYANG et al.: COST-EFFECTIVE CONDITION MONITORING FOR WIND TURBINES 265\n3) the fact that present techniques may not be suited to all\ntypes of WTs such as shown in Fig. 2;\n4) the fact that developing reliable WT condition monitoring\ntechniques requires complex and lengthy collaboration\nbetween WT operators and manufacturers in the field.\nWT power flows are disturbed by both mechanical and\nelectrical faults [16], [17]. To measure the WT shaft torque is\ncostly and usually impractical for a real WT. In contrast, shaft\nspeed and electrical power output are routinely monitored for\nWTs, but, to date, commercial CMSs do not use these signals.\nIn comparison with conventional stator current analysis,\nwidely adopted for condition monitoring motors [4], [6], power\nmonitoring could have the following disadvantages.\n1) The error in the total power signal depends not only on\nthe voltage and current transducer error \u03b5 but also on the\nmeasurement method. In the three-wattmeter method, the\nerror will be 6\u03b5, but, in the two-wattmeter method,\nthe error is limited to 4\u03b5, whereas the current signal error\nwould be only \u03b5. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio for\nbasic analysis should be better for current than power\nanalysis.\nOn the other hand, monitoring based on power analysis could\nhave the following advantages.\n1) The power signal is already available from the generator\nterminal voltage and current signals for the control of the\nWT and can conveniently be accessed.\n2) Fewer cheaper transducers than accelerometers and oil\ndebris probes are required for power monitoring.\n3) Mechanical and electrical faults both disturb the genera-\ntor power output, so power monitoring could detect both\ntypes of faults.\n4) Single line current analysis contains the mains frequency\ncarrier, whereas this is absent in the power signal. There-\nfore, the signal-to-noise ratio for faulty feature analysis\nshould be better for power than current analysis, balanc-\ning the aforementioned transducer error effect.\n5) In the power signal, the fault-related frequency side-\nbands, around the mains frequency, are folded down\naround dc, limiting the bandwidth needed to monitor the\nsignal.\nAn example of the current, voltage, and power signals mea-\nsured under faulty conditions on an induction generator, fitted to\nthe test rig described in the following, is shown in Fig. 3, where\nthe signals were collected when a periodic rotor electrical\nasymmetry was applied in the presence of serious noise due\nto power system imbalance.\nThe fault in Fig. 3 was applied at the time intervals of 20\u201340 s\nand 60\u201380 s and was absent in the other time intervals. It\ncan be seen that the amplitudes of both the current\u2013time and\nvoltage\u2013time waveforms gave no indication of abnormal con-\nditions, whereas the total three-phase power signal P changes\nsignificantly during the abnormality due to the presence of 2fse\nand 2sfse components. The total power P (t) was calculated\nusing\nP (t) =\n3\u2211\ni=1\nIi(t) \u00b7 Vi(t). (1)\nFig. 3. Comparison of current, voltage, and total power signal in the presence\nof a rotor asymmetry fault. (a) Line currents. (b) Phase voltages. (c) Total power.\nIII. DESIGN OF WAVELET-BASED ADAPTIVE FILTER\nIn this paper, a CWT-based adaptive filter has been designed\nto track the energy in the power signal in the prescribed fault-\nrelated frequency bands rather than at all frequencies of the\nmonitoring signal. In this way, the wavelet calculation can\nsignificantly be reduced, and the results can be displayed graph-\nically rather than as a screen dump image, making the technique\nattractive for online application. Details of the technique are\ndescribed as follows.\nThe CWT of a real-time signal x(t) can be defined as\nCWT(b, a) = 1\u221a|a|\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nx(t)\u03c8\u2217\n(\nt\u2212 b\na\n)\ndt (2)\nwhere the asterisk \u201c\u2217\u201d indicates the complex conjugate.\nTraditionally, the wavelet function \u03c8(t) is dilated or com-\npressed by changing the scale parameter a so that all signal\ncomponents ranging from frequency 0 to half the sampling\nfrequency can be projected onto an appropriate time-scale map,\nas shown in Fig. 4. The bottom figure shows the time waveform\nof a sample signal of increasing frequency being inspected; the\ntop figure shows the wavelet coefficients of this signal obtained\nat different wavelet scales and times.\nMany of the calculations shown in Fig. 4 are unnecessary for\nWT condition monitoring because the fault-related frequencies\nare few in number and the energy extracted at nonfault-related\nfrequencies is not helpful to assess the machine condition.\nTherefore, an adaptive CWT-based filter has been designed,\nwhich only extracts energy at known fault frequencies, while\nfrequencies unrelated to the fault are left unprocessed. The\ncalculation time for the new technique will be much shorter\nthan that for a conventional CWT applied to a broad band-\nwidth signal. Therefore, the proposed CWT-based energy\ntracking technique should prove more efficient for online\nprocessing of WT monitoring signals than conventional CWT\nprocessing.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Illustrative example of the conventional CWT.\nFig. 5. Two-dimensional sliding window.\nA time\u2013frequency sliding window has been designed for this\ntask, as shown in Fig. 5. Its central frequency \u03c9c is the mean\nfrequency during the time interval T of the prescribed fault-\nrelated frequency band. The upper and lower cutoff frequencies\n\u03c9upper and \u03c9lower are adapted to the fluctuation of the generator\nrotational speed \u03c9fg in that interval, i.e.,\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\n\u03c9upper = \u03c9c + \u03c9f\/2\n\u03c9lower = \u03c9c \u2212 \u03c9f\/2\n\u03c9f = \u03b7\u03c9fg.\n(3)\nFrom Fig. 4, it is noticed that \u03c9f could also be a time-\nvarying parameter, intrinsically dependent on the turbulence of\nthe wind. Experience has shown that onshore wind turbulence\nvaries between 12% and 20%, whereas offshore turbulence\napproximates to \u223c6%.\nThe relationship between any prescribed frequency \u03c9 and its\ncorresponding wavelet scale a is\na =\n\u03c90\n\u03c9\n. (4)\nWith the aid of (3) and (4), the range of the wavelet scales\nfor conducting bandpass filtering can be determined by\na \u2208 [amin amax] (5){\namin = \u03c90\u03c9upper\namax = \u03c90\u03c9lower .\n(6)\nTABLE I\nCOMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY COMPARISON BETWEEN CWT, DWT,\nAND PROPOSED APPROACH\nSubsequently, by performing the CWT locally in the scale\nrange defined by (5), a matrix of wavelet coefficients is obtained\nCWTlocal(b, a) =\n1\u221a|a|\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nx(t)\u03c8\u2217\n(\nt\u2212 b\na\n)\ndt. (7)\nThe energy A of the frequency component of interest in the\ntime interval T is estimated by\nA(t0 + T\/2)=max (|CWTlocal(b, a)|)\n{\na \u2208 [amin amax]\nb \u2208 [t0 t0 + T ].\n(8)\nThe sliding window is moved forward along the signal; the\nmaximum and minimum wavelet scales in (5) being redefined\nwithin each time interval according to the generator rotational\nspeed \u03c9fg. Then, using the aforementioned technique, the en-\nergy A in the fault-related frequency band is calculated in each\ntime interval using (7) and (8). These calculations are repeated\nuntil the whole signal has been processed. Finally, a curve\nof the energy variation in the fault-related frequency band is\nobtained, and changes in the running condition of the WT can\nbe assessed.\nThis task could have been accomplished using a series of\nconventional bandpass filters set up to cover the expected speed\nrange of the turbine. However, such an analysis would not have\nthe advantages of the CWT in processing nonstationary signals\nshown in Fig. 1 and [18].\nTo verify the computational efficiency of the proposed tech-\nnique compared to the traditional CWT and DWT, a calculation\nwas performed to extract the 50-Hz energy component from\n1 s of line current signal, sampled at a frequency of 2 kHz.\nThe time taken by each approach is listed in Table I. The\ncalculations were done in a computer with 1.4 GHz of Intel\nPentium processor and 512 MB of RAM.\nFrom Table I, it can be concluded that the proposed energy\ntracking technique is the most computationally efficient of the\nthree approaches.\nIV. WT CONDITION MONITORING BY POWER\nSIGNAL ANALYSIS\nIn view of the proposed advantages of generator power\nsignal analysis for detecting both mechanical and electrical\nfaults in a variety of designs of WT drive train, it has been\napplied in this paper, in combination with the energy tracking\nmethod described previously, to develop a new WT condition\nmonitoring technique.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Schematic diagrams of the WT drive train test rig. (a) With permanent-magnet synchronous generator installed. (b) With induction generator\ninstalled.\nA. WT Drive Train Test Rig\nOne of the difficulties in gaining practical industry experi-\nence of condition monitoring on real WTs is the lack of collab-\noration needed with WT operators and manufacturers, due to\ndata confidentiality, particularly when faults are present. This\ncan be avoided by gaining condition monitoring experience\nusing a controllable experimental test rig to which defined faults\ncan be applied. Therefore, the technique proposed in this paper\nhas been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test\nrig designed to investigate condition monitoring signals in the\nlaboratory. This test rig was described in detail in [16] and was\nequipped first with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator\nand, subsequently, with an induction generator, both as shown\nin Fig. 6.\nThe synchronous generator [Fig. 6(a)], such as might be used\nin a direct-drive WT, was rated for the experiment at 10 kW,\nthree-phase 54-pole permanent-magnet machine with a rectified\noutput feeding a resistive load bank.\nThe induction generator [Fig. 6(b)], such as might be used\nin a geared-drive WT, was rated for the experiment at 30 kW,\nthree-phase four-pole wound-rotor machine, with the rotor cir-\ncuit coupled via slip rings to a three-phase resistive load bank,\nso that rotor electrical imbalance could be applied, and the\ngenerator stator fed the three-phase mains.\nThe test rig comprises a 54-kW dc variable-speed motor\nand a two-stage gearbox, instrumented and controlled using\nLabVIEW. In the experiments, a variety of wind speed inputs\ncould be applied to the test rig via the dc motor, the speed\nof which is controlled by an external model incorporating the\nproperties of natural wind at a variety of speeds and turbulences\nand the mechanical behavior of a 2-MW WT operating under\nclosed-loop conditions. Relevant signals were collected from\nthe terminals of the generator and the drive train when subjected\nto this driving speed.\nA number of electrical and mechanical drive train faults\ncould be applied to the test rig. Because they are not necessarily\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham. Downloaded on April 09,2010 at 13:54:59 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Mechanical Unbalance Fault Simulated on Rotor of\nSynchronous Generator\nThe mechanical unbalance fault was simulated by attaching\na 1-kg mass to the generator rotor with an equivalent rotating\nmass of 290.7 kg, which is \u223c0.3%. This represents a balance\nquality grade of G 7.8 (7.8 mm\/s), within the limit of G 16\n(16 mm\/s) prescribed in ISO1940-1:2003 for a low-speed pro-\npeller shaft, applicable to a direct-drive WT shaft. The details\nof this estimation are given in Appendix A. The peak-to-peak\nmeasured displacement of the generator shaft changed a little\nbefore and after the placement of the unbalanced mass, varying\nin the range 90\u2013140 \u03bcm. The equivalent vibration velocity\nwould have been 0.13\u20130.21 mm\/s, with the generator running\nat the maximum rotational speed of 28 r\/min well within the\n0.71-mm\/s limit that is acceptable for machines \u2264 15 kW\nprescribed in ISO2372:1974.\nWhen the synchronous generator ran at varying speed repre-\nsenting the wind driving situation, the speed, torque, and total\npower were measured using a sampling frequency of 1 kHz,\nand the \u201cfault-like perturbation\u201d was periodically applied to the\nrotor. The time waveforms of the signals before and after the\napplication are shown in Fig. 7(a).\nFrom Fig. 7(a), it can be seen that, in the presence of the mass\nunbalance fault, the driving shaft torque signal gave a response\nat the shaft rotational frequency frm, as expected, fluctuating\nby 8% range due to the combined effects of mass unbalance\nfault and wind driving turbulence, which can be compared to\nfluctuating by 4% due to the wind driving turbulence alone. By\ncontrast, the generator power showed only a slight change in the\npresence of the fault. In this case, the fault-related frequency is\nfrm, and the CWT-based energy tracking technique was applied\nto extract energy at this frequency, as shown in Fig. 7(b). This\nprovided a clear indication of the presence or absence of the\nmechanical unbalance fault despite the fact that the shaft speed\nwas varying continuously throughout the experiment and the\neffect could not be observed in the unprocessed total power\nsignal shown in Fig. 7(a).\nFig. 7. Mass unbalance fault applied to a synchronous generator rotor on the\nWT test rig, representing a direct-drive WT. (a) Signals when a mass unbalance\nfault was simulated on a synchronous generator rotor. (b) Detecting a mass\nunbalance fault from the power signal.\nTABLE II\nPARAMETERS USED FOR CALCULATION RESULTS IN FIG. 7\nIt can be seen from Fig. 7(b) that a 0.3% or G 7.8 unbal-\nance fault was easily detectable. This shows that the proposed\ntechnique has the potential to detect an incipient mechanical\nunbalance fault of 0.3% or G 7.8 on a direct-drive WT. The\nparameters used for this calculation are given in Table II.\nC. Electrical Asymmetry on Rotor of\nInduction Generator\nThe electrical asymmetry was simulated on the induction\ngenerator by adjusting the phase resistances in the load bank\nexternally connected to the rotor. Two levels of rotor asymmetry\nwere applied to investigate the effect of an incipient fault. These\nwere an electrical asymmetry of Ue = 4.7% and, then, a larger\nasymmetry of 9.2%. The details of the rotor circuit and the\nestimation of asymmetry are described in Appendix B and\nin Table IV.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Electrical asymmetry applied to an induction generator rotor on the test\nrig, representing a geared-drive WT. (a) Signals when an electrical asymmetry\nfault was simulated on an induction generator rotor. (b) Detecting an electrical\nasymmetry fault from the power signal.\nAs in the mechanical unbalance experiment, the rotational\nspeed, mechanical drive shaft torque, and generator total power\nsignals were measured when the \u201cfaultlike perturbation\u201d was\nperiodically applied to the rotor. A smaller fault was applied in\nthe period 60\u2013120 s and a larger fault between 180 and 240 s,\nwith the rotor circuits being balanced in the periods 0\u201360 s,\n120\u2013180 s, and 240\u2013300 s. The time waveforms of the signals\ncollected in this experiment are shown in Fig. 8(a), and it can\nbe seen that, due to the effect of the varying generator speed,\nthe fault symptom cannot be observed clearly from either the\ngenerator shaft torque or total power.\nWhen the rotor phase resistances are imbalanced, the genera-\ntor current, voltage, and power are modulated twice by the slip\nfrequency as the rotor asymmetry moves through the air gap\nmagnetic field twice for every pole pair cycle [4]. Therefore, in\nthis case, the fault-related frequency is 2sfse, and the CWT-\nbased energy tracking technique was applied to extract the\nenergy at that frequency, as shown in Fig. 8(b).\nFrom Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that the smaller, 4.7%, fault was\nnot clear although it is still visible, so the condition monitoring\nalgorithm had limited detectability in this case. This lack of\ndetectability was due to the residual imbalances present in the\nTABLE III\nPARAMETERS USED FOR CALCULATION RESULTS IN FIG. 8\nrotor windings, brush gear, and connections, as well as the\nnegative influence of the timely varying generator rotational\nspeed which partially hid the faulty feature. However, the larger\n9.2% fault was clearly visible in the figure and, therefore,\nreadily detectable despite the fact that the 2sfse frequency\nsignal was varying during the experimental processes.\nThis shows that the proposed technique has the potential to\ndetect an incipient 9.2% electrical asymmetry fault on a geared-\ndrive WT generator. The parameters used for this calculation\nare given in Table III.\nV. CONCLUSION\nTo improve the WT availability and reduce the O&M costs,\na new WT condition monitoring technique has been proposed.\nFrom this research, the following conclusions can be reached.\n1) In comparison with the conventional vibration, tem-\nperature measurement, and lubrication oil analysis,\nthe technique proposed shows the following potential\nadvantages:\na) reduced capital cost;\nb) ability to detect both electrical and mechanical faults;\nc) applicable to both geared and direct-drive WTs.\n2) The proposed CWT-based energy tracking method not\nonly reduces the calculation needed to extract features\nfrom lengthy online data but also provides a feasible\ncondition monitoring approach that is applicable to WTs\noperating at either fixed or variable speed.\n3) Experiments have shown that the proposed technique is\ncapable of detecting both mechanical and electrical faults\nin WT drive trains of different types.\n4) The technique is a feasible way to establish a sim-\nple, cheap, but potentially global cost-effective CMS for\na WT.\nThe technique now needs to be applied to the power signals\nobtained from real WTs during real mechanical and electrical\nfaults to determine the detectability of the algorithm and its\nability to detect incipient faults in both cases.\nFurther work will also be needed to establish the ability of\nthis technique for a wider range of faults and for a variable-\nspeed WT under closed-loop control.\nAPPENDIX A\nGENERATOR ROTOR MECHANICAL UNBALANCE\nBased on BS ISO1940-1:2003, the balance quality grade G\nmay be calculated by\nG = e \u00b7 2\u03c0frm (A1)\nwhere\ne =mr\/Meq (A2)\nUm =(m\/Meq)\u00d7 100.
