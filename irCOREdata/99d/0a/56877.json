Researchers in \nComputer-mediated communication (CMC) have conducted \na great deal of work on replicating typical non-verbal \naspects of face-to-face communication in computer \nmediated social environments and also introducing new \nnon-verbal cues in a manner that is respectful of the context \nin which these interactions take place [3]. One of the major \nstrategies for increasing the richness of social presence has \nbeen by exposing the underlying social behaviours of group \nmembers, and making implicit factors in computer-\nmediated communication explicit. For instance, applications \nhave been created that expose social network information \n[10] as \u201cSocio-Contextual\u201d information (data that makes \nhidden information about the social context of individuals \nmore visible) to participants within group working \nscenarios [5,2,8] and games [6]. \nIn related work to that described here, Martino et al found \nthat displaying socio-contextual information in the form of \nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) indices to players of a \ncollaborative group treasure hunting game had a positive \neffect on increasing group ability to cooperate and engage \nwith the game [9]. \nOSNs as Socially Enhanced Application Platforms \nThe explosive growth in popularity of Online Social \nNetworks (OSNs) such as MySpace and Facebook serves to \nhighlight the value of rich social context in mediated \nenvironments. Such sites act as a social management tool \nthrough which users can describe their various social \nrelationships. Upon this Social Graph, mediated \napplications can be built that take advantage of the social \ncontext provided in order to create more engaging \nexperiences [4,11]. These applications range in complexity \nfrom simple messaging and status-sharing tools, to complex \nand sophisticated games involving rich social data. For \nexample the game Restaurant City allows players to \n\u201cemploy\u201d real friends as waiters and chefs in their virtual \nrestaurants while FriendFolio allows players to buy and sell \ntheir own friends in popularity based stock market. \nThe combination of research on socio-contextual \naugmentation and the emerging importance of OSNs as a \nplatform for social gaming led us to seek to investigate \nwhether this same augmentation is effective in applications \nbuilt on existing social network structures (e.g. Facebook) \nand whether this would extend to activities not centred \naround task completion or problem solving. \n  \nFigure 1 - Magpies Interface \nMAGPIES \nIn order to answer these research questions, a social game \napplication was created and deployed using the Facebook \nplatform. The platform exposes large amounts of \ninformation about the social graph to application developers \nthrough an API to allow the creation of socially rich games \nand tools. The game described here, called Magpies, is \ncentred on the theme of collection; in many cultures, \nMagpies are birds associated with the activity of collecting \nsmall shiny trinkets with which they decorate their nests. \nPlayers in the game work individually and create \ncollections or stashes around a theme determined through \nfree text entry. Other players are invited to contribute items \nthat match the theme, in the form of text, images and\/or \nlocations. The stash then builds up over time as a list of \ncuriosities that match this theme. Players can rate one \nanother\u2019s stashes and compete to build the most popular \ncollections. \nPlayers are also able to create and join arbitrary groups \nwithin the system. Groups are ranked against each other \nbased on the status of the players within, to add a socially \ncompetitive angle to an otherwise individually driven game. \nMagpies was tested internally through a series of usability \nevaluations and focus groups in order to fine tune the game \ndesign and interface, before being released officially on the \nFacebook platform and being made open to the public. \nSocial Context Information \nIn Magpies, as an addition to the main game, users were \nexposed to a variety of measures based on a selection of \nstandard Social Network Analysis (SNA) indices (e.g. as in \n[14]). These were split into group and individual indices. \nThe Group Indices included Group Centralisation, Group \nReciprocity and Group Density. The Individual Indices \nincluded Degree Centrality, In-Degree Centrality, Out-\nDegree Centrality and Reciprocity. \nThese measures were calculated regularly based on activity \nwithin the game, and presented to the user as values \nbetween zero and five \u201cstars\u201d (as seen in Figure 2). The \ntechnical names for the indices were replaced in the \ninterface by labels validated by focus groups as more \nmeaningful to players (i.e. \u201cReciprocity\u201d became \n\u201cEquality\u201d) and supported with descriptions and examples \nwithin the game. \nAdditional visualisations allowed players to see activity in \nthe form of network graphs. For example, it was possible to \nview the pattern of interactions between players within \ngroups in the form of a network graph, where individuals \nwere represented by nodes and connected by arrows. These \narrows represent the act of one player contributing to the \nstash of another. Players could also visualise group \nmembership by seeing a graph that represented each group \nas a node connected by edges indicating shared \nmembership. This aided the players when choosing to join \ngroups.  \n \nFigure 2 - Group Social Network Indices in Magpies \nIt must be emphasised that the enhanced social contextual \ninformation provided to players in the Magpies condition \nwas provided as additional supporting information around \nthe core mechanics of the game. There was no central task \nplayers were asked to perform with the aid of this \ninformation, and no problems that required solving through \norganised group collaboration. \nMETHOD \nIn order to conduct a controlled experiment, a second, \nalmost exact duplicate of the Magpies game was created \ncalled Beachcombers, so-named from the activity of \nexploring beaches to discover trinkets and treasures washed \nashore by the tides. This game was identical to Magpies \napart from the branding and the fact that the social \ncontextual information was hidden from view of the players \nthemselves. \nBoth games were released at the same time to a small group \nof volunteer participants selected by trial organisers and \nfrom then additional players were free to join the game \nthrough natural \u201cviral\u201d spread. Each new player was asked \nto complete a release form for trial participation before \nbeginning to play. All interactions with both versions of the \nsystem, including page access and usage of functionality, \nwere recorded, along with the results of the social network \nindices, for post-trial analysis. Players were able to join \neither game freely. Despite this only one (non-invited) \nparticipant interacted with both games during the trial \nperiod. \nThe concurrent trials for both games lasted for 50 days \nstarting at the end of April 2009. At the end of the trial \nperiod questionnaires were distributed to all participants in \norder to gather additional non-procedural information about \nthe trial. \nRESULTS \nOver the course of the trial a total of 215 players played the \ntwo games. Between both conditions 166 collections were \ncreated, and these provoked a total of 364 response \ninteractions (including a combination of text, images and \nlocations) from other players. \nTable 1 - Collections and Interactions in both Conditions \n Players (N) Collections Total \nInteractions \nMagpies 102 67 297 \nBeachcombers \n(Control) \n113 75 89 \nTable 1 shows the breakdown of players, collections and \nresponse interactions between the two distinct conditions. \nBoth conditions had a similar number of players who \ncreated a similar number of collections. There is a striking \ndifference in the number of interactions contributed by \nplayers in the augmented (Magpies) condition. \nGrowth of Player-base \nFigure 3 shows the cumulative growth in registrations \nexperienced by each application during the trial period. The \ngraphs both follow a very similar \u201cS-curve\u201d of diffusion \n[12]. A month into the trial, the rate of new registrations \nslowed. This pattern of growth matches the experience of \nFacebook applications in general [4,11]. Both Magpies and \nBeachcombers experienced extremely similar patterns of \ngrowth, which indicates that the additional socio-contextual \ninformation in the augmented condition does not appear to \nbe an interesting factor for attracting new players, or \n \nFigure 3 - Cumulative Registrations for both Conditions \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\nTrial Day\nC\nu\nm\nu\nla\nti\nv\ne \nR\neg\nis\ntr\nat\nio\nn\ns\nMagpies\nBeachcombers\n \nFigure 4 - Interactions and Stashes in both Conditions \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\nTrial Day\nC\nu\nm\nu\nla\nti\nv\ne \nC\no\nu\nn\nt Beachcombers Stash\nBeachcombers Int'ns\nMagpies Stash\nMagpies Int'ns\n motivating existing players to actively engage in \nrecruitment. \nEffect of Enhanced Social Context on Interactions \nIn-game collections created in the socio-contextually \naugmented condition (Magpies) provoked many more \nresponse interactions from other players than those \ncollections in the non-augmented condition. \nFigure 4 shows the pattern of interactions (i.e. the act of a \nplayer making a contribution to another player\u2019s collection \nwithin the game) experienced in both conditions over time, \ncompared with the growth of collection creation. As can be \nclearly observed, the pattern of interactions in the \naugmented condition appears to be highly accelerated when \ncompared with the non-augmented condition, despite the \npatterns of collection creation and player-base growth being \nvery similar. This indicates an increase in engagement with \nthe game for the players in the augmented condition. \nCONCLUSION \nIn this paper we have described a new application, \nMagpies, which is a non-task-oriented social game \ndeployed on the Facebook OSN. Magpies uses social \nnetwork analysis (SNA) information to add social data to \nthe context of a player\u2019s interactions within the game. \nIn a controlled study involving over two hundred users, the \nresearch shows that when players were exposed to this \nadditional socio-contextual information, they were more \nlikely to be involved in a higher number of social \ninteractions with other game players compared with a game \nthat did not display this socio-contextual information. \nThese results corroborate findings in previous work by \nMartino et al [9], in which players exposed to SNA \ninformation while playing games demonstrated increased \nactivity and engagement, and extends this work further by \nshowing that the observed increase in activity is not just \nlimited to games centred around collaborative task \ncompletion or problem solving, but also applies to games \nsuch as Magpies, where the central objective is not as \nclearly defined and the additional social information is \nprovided simply as context to the game play. \nMagpies was deployed on the social platform of Facebook \nand allowed to grow naturally through the social graph. \nHowever, results show that the use of socio-contextual \naugmentation did not have any significant effect on the rate \nof growth of the player-base. The increased engagement \nand increased social presence observed with active players \ndoes not appear to be a motivating factor for new users to \njoin the game. Since the socio-contextual enhancement in \nthe Magpies condition was not related to the act of \nrecruitment it may not have impacted on recruiting \nbehaviours. In terms of Kluger & DeNisi\u2019s theory of \nFeedback Intervention [7], when goals and feedbacks are \nclear as in our socio-contextual information, optimal usage \nof the feedback occurs, and users' attention is oriented \ntoward task motivation level (in which users usually try to \nfind a way to fill the gap between feedback value and goal \nvalue). A feedback on activity (such as the one we are \nproposing) may shift users' attention toward task-\nmotivation level and therefore drive users' attention toward \nincreasing social interactions (indices values), since this is \nthe behaviour suggested by the feedback itself. \nPlayer activity may be considered an indicator for social \npresence in mediated communication [1], and for a social \ngame such as Magpies, additional socio-contextual \ninformation serves to both add an additional layer of \ncontext onto the social gaming experience, and also to make \nthe gaming experience more engaging for the players. \nWe have demonstrated that adding rich socio-contextual \ninformation shown to game players can enhance their \ngeneral engagement with the game. However, it is not clear \nwhat specific contextual information is the most effective. \nIn Magpies, players had a large selection of indices to \nbrowse, but the relative efficacy of each index is unknown. \nREFERENCES \n1.
