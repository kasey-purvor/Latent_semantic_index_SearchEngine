A third point is that the idea of the\nnetwork acts as a powerful metaphor even if we are able to discount any particular theory\ngenerated in its support. The network metaphor can act as a unifying concept allowing us\nto bring together apparently disparate elements of the field.\nI would lend support to all of these; but within the context of the paper, the third, the\nexploration of the metaphor of networks, does raise some concerns for me. These\nconcerns fall under two related headings. First, I have some concerns about how the\ntechnical and mathematical models of networks are used (or not) within this paper to\nexplore \u2018the wider debate about networks\u2019 and to elaborate the network metaphor.\nSecondly, I have some concerns about the network metaphor itself.\nThe use of technical and mathematical models of networks\nWhen I initially read the paper I was expecting to see a discussion of one or more\nmathematical models of the topology of complex networks that could in turn be used\n*Centre for Learning and Quality Enhancement, University of Teesside, Middlesbrough, TS1\n3BA, UK.

Ingraham\n       to help clarify the loose usage of the network metaphor that is, as the paper demon-\nstrates, applied widely in a range of contexts that are of interest to learning technolo-\ngists. For example, in introducing his discussion of modelling network topologies,\nJones writes, \u2018The importance of this field of study is that it holds out the prospect of\ndeveloping mathematical laws of networks that may prove to be robust in describing\na broad range of phenomena.\u2019 While I admit that the notion of \u2018developing mathe-\nmatical laws\u2019 in the context of any aspect of human behaviour rather alarms me, I am\nquite convinced that such modelling can serve to illuminate the way the network\nmetaphor is used in other contexts.\nTo be fair, I don\u2019t think the author ever had any intention of explicitly applying the\nmodel (Barabasi et al., 2002) he describes in the section on networks in the way I had\nhoped; and I guess that my hope had more to do with my own narrow and rather\nunder-developed interest in the topology of electronically mediated scholarly argu-\nment (Ingraham, 2000). Rather the paper offers us a view of a number of different\nareas in which a network metaphor is being used and encourages us to examine that\nmetaphor as a way of relating those various areas of discourse. This is perfectly appro-\npriate and the discussion most interesting, but I guess I am still hoping that these\nremarks will provoke the author into making more explicit use of the model articu-\nlated by Barabasi et al. (2002) to illuminate the other instances of the network meta-\nphor that he introduces.\nThis seems particularly important because, having been provoked by Jones (2004)\nto read the Barabasi paper, it did seem to me to offer a number of interesting potential\npoints of contact with some of the other instances of networks that Jones discusses.\nFor example, the power-law distribution model presented by Barabasi is at least remi-\nniscent of the power relationships at issue within Jones\u2019 discussion of the \u2018Networked\nSociety\u2019. Further, for me at least, the juxtaposition of these two discussions of\nnetworks (social and mathematical) was also highly reminiscent of Foucault\u2019s (1979)\nconsideration of the power relationship between vertical hierarchies and \u2018micro-revo-\nlutions\u2019 that, like Bakhtin\u2019s (1984) \u2018carnavalesque\u2019, complicate and undermine\nauthority. In short, as Jones suggests, the power of the network metaphor if linked\nfrom one area of discourse to another can at the very least be thought provoking; and\nI would like to know more about what thoughts it has produced in the author.\nHowever, while this slide from one instantiation of the network metaphor to\nanother supports Jones\u2019 contention that \u2018\u2026\u201cnetworks\u201d provide a useful metaphor\nthrough which to focus aspects of research into \u201conline learning\u201d\u2019, it also points in\nthe direction of some of my concerns with the respect to the network metaphor itself.\nAs Jones recognizes in his discussion of the ideological baggage that may be associated\nwith it, the network metaphor can be value laden in various ways that, if not carefully\nhandled, may actually undermine its utility to the learning technologist.\nFirst, networks, understood as a collection of nodes and links can be, and too often\nare, understood to be planer structures. That is, flat two-dimensional, even if infi-\nnitely extensible, structures. However, complex networks (whether cyber, social, or\nbiological) are never less than three-dimensional. Understanding this added dimen-\nsion of complexity can make a significant difference to our understanding of the issues\n Networks and learning\u2014a commentary\n \n191\n                to be illuminated through the network metaphor. For this reason alone Jones is right\nto encourage writers on the subject of networked society and learning to be more\naware of the technical literature on the topology of networks. The expression \u2018world-\nwide web\u2019 is a case in point. The word \u2018web\u2019 suggests a relatively simple two-dimen-\nsional set of nodes and links while \u2018worldwide\u2019 suggests a degree of complexity\nincompatible with that image. Barabasi et al. (2002) offer statistics about the levels of\ncomplexity in such systems that are truly daunting; and modelling the topology of\ncyber space has almost become a form of geographical research in its own right (see\nCyber Geography Research1).\nConcerns about the network metaphor\nThe metaphor, if not carefully grounded, can lead writers to over simplify the issues\nunder study; and this leads to my second concern about the network metaphor. Jones\n(and others including Barabasi et al.) when talking of social networks treat human\nbeings as \u2018nodes\u2019. \nNetworked learning remains concerned with social process but it sets itself the task of\nunderstanding the links between different nodes, the learners, the tutors and the resources\nthat make up a networked learning setting.\nMy question here is what are the implications of treating tutors and students as nodes?\nComputers and documents or other artefacts can easily be understood as nodes; and\nI can see how this might be extended to include concrete socio-political structures.\nHowever, tutors and students, as human beings, seem to me to be better understood\nnot as nodes or links, but as link makers.\nI accept that tropologically it is possible to abstract a pattern of relationships between\na group of individuals that might be usefully described as a network and that in such\nan abstraction the people might be viewed as nodes. However, such an abstraction is\nonly realised as a network if the people make the links and it is the pattern of links that\nthey make and the \u2018social process\u2019 through they make them that actually constitutes\ntheir networking and instantiates a particular instance of a network. Of course their\ncapacity to engage in this process may be to a greater or lesser degree constrained by\nthe physical (or social) infra-structure of network platforms through which they make\nlinks, but that is not the same thing as seeing them as nodes.\nIn order to understand the distinction I am trying to make, let us consider some\nrelatively small subset of a complex but power delimited network for learning\u2014the\nresources made available to support even a single week\u2019s study in most academic\ndisciplines. We can imagine this network of resources as instantiated online or not. It\nreally doesn\u2019t matter. In any event, what we will normally have is some core text(s) or\nactivities with which the learner needs to interact. These core texts\/activities will be\nlinked to one another in various possible ways and sequences. They will also normally\nbe linked to precursor texts\/activities to which the learner may need to return and to\nsubsidiary texts\/activities with which the learner may or may not interact, and which\nmay or may not lead the learner to follow up further references contained within them\n 192\n \nB. Ingraham\n           and so on (at least potentially, ad infinitum). Of course, practical considerations will\nalways limit the play of what Kristeva (1986) called intertextuality, but the real point\nhere is that the path, followed through the potential network of nodes, the set of links\nmade between nodes, is likely to be different for each learner.\nIf in a networked learning environment we scale this up to include the Internet, the\npotential variety in the complexity expands infinitely. In effect every URL on the\ninternet can be linked to every other. However, it is the only the links actually made\nby an individual learner that represent the network of which they are a part and (to\nsome degree) what they have learned from and about that network. To talk about\nlearners in such complex systems as nodes, seems to me to risk unhelpfully over-\nsimplifying the situation by directing attention away from the process of networking\nand towards a necessarily inaccurate abstract network metaphor. It is in understand-\ning (and, yes, probably directing) this process of exploration, this activity of linking\nthat I, as a pedagogue, am most interested.\nI accept that this model is perhaps one of \u2018networked individualism\u2019 (Castells,\n1996, 2001), but the fact that networkers may be collaboratively (or otherwise linked)\nthrough a network does not, it seems to me make them nodes; and so reducing them,\nhowever valuable in understanding the powerful role of network infrastructure in\ndelimiting the learning process, doesn\u2019t seem to me to add much to our understand-\ning of the process itself. More helpfully in that respect is perhaps the transactional\nmodel of internetworking articulated by Garrison and Anderson (2003). They view\nhigher education as \u2018a supportive critical community of inquiry\u2019 that can be extended\nin space and time by contemporary network technologies. By focusing on the trans-\naction (linking in this case) their model provides an interesting grounding in research\npraxis for the study of that activity in such a community; but it could also benefit from\na more robust network model or metaphor.\nHere again the model articulated by Barabasi and his colleagues (2002) is sugges-\ntive. This model contains concepts of clustering and replication that, as Jones cites,\nargue that networks are \u2018\u2026 far from random, but \u2026 evolve following robust self-orga-\nnizing principles and evolutionary laws\u2026\u2019 (Barabasi et al., 2002). Although I am not\nmathematician enough to be certain, I think the Barabasi model of replication is\nmathematically discreet from the self-replicating mathematics of fractals, but still it is\nnonetheless reminiscent of fractal development and this may hint at a way of model-\nling the networking rather than the network.\nThe growth patterns of fractals have proven particularly interesting in describing\ncomplex and chaotic natural systems (Gleick, 1987) and they might prove a valuable\nalternative for modelling the topology of networking. Jo\u00ebl de Rosnay (1995), for\nexample, has used such an approach for what he sees as the symbiotic relationship\nbetween humanity and modern communication systems. If one focuses attention on\nthe activity, on the \u2018social process\u2019, we may find that the topology of cyber relation-\nships is rhizoid rather than racinated. In their seminal study, Rhizome, Deleuze and\nGuattari (1976) exploit a play on the French word \u2018racine\u2019 which means root.\nHowever, racine is also the root for racination (thinking) and allied to our English\nword rational. Rational thought they argue is typically bifurcating like the roots of\n Networks and learning\u2014a commentary\n \n193\n                                    plants. It spreads out rather like a network. This they compare with an alternative\nmodel, the rhizome. Rhizomes rather than spreading out, fold back on and through\nthemselves in complex patterns of growth that are reminiscent of fractals and, perhaps\nprovide a better image of (metaphor for) the three-dimensional pattern of linking and\nrelinking that typifies internetworking.\nConclusion\nPerhaps neither the image of the rhizome nor the mathematical model of fractals will\nprove adequate to the task of providing a truly robust description of networking.\nHowever, in applying any such metaphor, I think it is important to distinguish\nbetween the physical instantiation of a network, whether in the wiring of a computer\nnetwork or in social structures, and the actual activity of internetworking, which may\nprove to be less susceptible to either the topology or the tropology of the image of\nnetwork. In any event, I hope these remarks serve to reflect just how valuable I think\nJones\u2019 paper is in offering up a direction for future inquiry. Working to develop better\nmodels of the topology of the networks and using such models to investigate and\nground the metaphor of the network can only improve our understanding of learning,\nwhether networked online or through other social structures.\nNotes\n1.
