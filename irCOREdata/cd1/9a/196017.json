The experiment was carried out in the evening hours when the electron density in the F-region dropped, and the HF pump frequency fH was near and then above the critical frequency of the F2 layer. The distinctive feature of this experiment is that the pump frequency was just below the third electron gyro harmonic frequency, while both the HF pump beam and UHF radar beam were directed towards the magnetic zenith (MZ). The HF pump-induced phenomena were diagnosed with several instruments: the bi-static HF radio scatter on the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg path, the CUTLASS radar in Hankasalmi (Finland), the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at Troms\u00f8 and the Troms\u00f8 ionosonde (dynasonde). The results show thermal electron excitation of the HF-induced striations seen simultaneously from HF bi-static scatter and CUTLASS radar observations, accompanied by increases of electron temperature when the heater frequency was near and then above the critical frequency of the F2 layer by up to 0.4 MHz. An increase of the electron density up to 25% accompanied by strong HF-induced electron heating was observed, only when the heater frequency was near the critical frequency and just below the third electron gyro harmonic frequency.

Ionosphere (Active experiments) \u2013 Radio sci-\nence (Nonlinear phenomena)\n1 Introduction\nIt is well known that intense HF radio waves transmitted\nfrom high-power ground-based HF heating facilities strongly\nmodify the ionospheric plasma. The excitation of artificial\nsmall-scale field-aligned irregularities or striations (Minkoff\net al., 1974; Djuth et al., 1985; Blagoveshchenskaya et\nal., 1999, 2006b), HF-induced electron heating (Rietveld\net al., 2003) and airglow (Brandstrom et al., 1999; Peder-\nsen and Carlson, 2001; Kosch et al., 2002), anomalous ab-\nsorption (Robinson, 1989) and other phenomena occur at\nthe upper hybrid resonance altitude in HF heating experi-\nments when O-mode polarized HF pump waves reach the\nionospheric reflection height. An O-mode HF pump wave\ncouples through striations into electrostatic (upper hybrid)\nwaves at the upper-hybrid resonance altitude, which is be-\nlow the reflection height of the heating wave. Upper hybrid\nwaves propagate in a direction near perpendicular to the mag-\nnetic field and their energy dissipation heats the electrons.\nThrough thermal instabilities, these waves can excite artifi-\ncial field-aligned irregularities (AFAIs) which can trap the\nexciting upper hybrid field. Theoretical work undertaken in\nthe 1970s indicated that the thermal parametric instability\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n132 N. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: HF pumping towards magnetic zenith\n(Grach and Trakhtengerts, 1976) and resonance instability\n(Vas\u2019kov and Gurevich, 1976) play important roles in the\ngeneration of artificial field-aligned irregularities, or stria-\ntions. More recent theoretical studies of non-linear stabiliza-\ntion of the striations (Gurevich et al., 1995), the self-focusing\nof the HF pump wave caused by the density depletions within\nthe striations (Gurevich et al., 2001), and the excitation of\ndensity and\/or temperature-gradient-driven instabilities such\nas a drift wave (Franz et al., 1999) have also detailed various\ngeneration mechanisms. Striations are generated near the up-\nper hybrid resonance (UHR) altitude, where the heater fre-\nquency is f 2H=f\n2\nUHR=f\n2\np+f\n2\nce, where fp is the local plasma\nfrequency and fce is the electron gyrofrequency. The UHR\nheight is several kilometers below the reflection level of the\nHF pump wave. Radio wave HF pump-induced ionospheric\nphenomena occurring near electron gyroharmonics have at-\ntracted considerable interest especially as double- vs. single-\nresonance phenomena.\nElectron acceleration above 10 eV is well established, and\nrecent measurements of blue emissions at 427.8 nm from\nN+2 in artificial aurora at high latitudes (Holma et al., 2006;\nGustavsson et al., 2006) are direct evidence of some flux of\nelectrons with energies above 18 eV, producing HF-enhanced\nionization. Spatio-temporal evolution of HF-induced phe-\nnomena near the fourth electron gyroharmonic (Ashrafi et al.,\n2006, 2007) is indicative of a descent in altitude of EISCAT\nUHF ion line enhancements and optical emissions, both ac-\ncompanied by pump-induced variations in electron density.\nEISCAT\/HEATING experiments at Troms\u00f8 have shown\nAFAIs excited in the F-region as well as in the auroral E-\nregion when the pump frequency exceeded the critical fre-\nquency, as observed by an ionosonde located near the HF\nheating facility. Djuth et al. (1985) found from VHF radar\nobservations during Troms\u00f8 HF heating experiments, that\nthe generation of striations in the auroral E-region was possi-\nble when the heater frequency, fH , exceeded the critical fre-\nquency foEs by 0.2 MHz. The same result was obtained by\nBlagoveshchenskaya et al. (1999, 2006a) when strong heater-\ninduced striations were observed in the auroral E-region with\nbi-static HF radio scatter. Striations have also been observed\nfrom Troms\u00f8 HF heating experiments in the night-side F-\nregion of the auroral ionosphere when foF2 drops below the\nheater frequency by up to 0.5 MHz (Blagoveshchenskaya et\nal., 2006b). In all these studies the condition of the auro-\nral ionosphere was monitored by ionosonde data. It was\nfound that despite the fact that the HF pump frequency ex-\nceeded foF2 (foEs), it was comparable to the maximum up-\nper hybrid frequency. Observations of airglow at 630 nm\n(red line) and 557.7 nm (green line) during the HF iono-\nspheric modification experiments at the HAARP heating fa-\ncility have shown HF-induced green and red lines at the mag-\nnetic zenith (MZ) to persist after the critical frequency foF2\ndropped below the heater frequency (Pedersen et al., 2003).\nIn the same study it was mentioned that the brightest emis-\nsions had a slight tendency to occur very near the critical\nfrequency of the F2 layer, but all emissions cut off sharply\nat about 0.5 MHz above foF2. Again here the status of the\nionosphere was estimated from an ionosonde located at the\nHAARP site. Mishin et al. (2005) proposed a scenario for\nthe HF heater-induced phenomena at magnetic zenith in the\nunderdense ionosphere when foF2 dropped below the heater\nfrequency, but HF-induced airglow at green and red lines re-\nmained. He explained this feature in terms of strong turbu-\nlence at magnetic zenith, with the oscillating two-stream in-\nstability (OTSI) of upper hybrid waves as the primary source\nof Langmuir waves. Note that ionosondes provide informa-\ntion about the status of the ionosphere above the heating fa-\ncility as a whole, but they cannot reproduce the peculiarities\nin the different parts of the heated volume with high tempo-\nral resolution. Hence there is a need to compare data from\nthe dynasonde (Rietveld et al., 2008) and the EISCAT UHF\nradar directed towards magnetic zenith.\nIn this paper we present multi-instrument experimental re-\nsults from an experiment on 13 October 2006 at the EIS-\nCAT\/HEATING facility at Troms\u00f8, Norway, where the HF-\npump beam was directed towards the magnetic zenith (MZ).\nIn the course of the experiment the electron density in the F-\nregion dropped, and the heater frequency was near and then\nabove the critical frequency of F2 layer. Of special impor-\ntance to this experiment is that the pump frequency was just\nbelow the third electron gyro harmonic frequency. We exam-\nine the behavior of the HF-induced striations from bi-static\nHF radio scatter on the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg path\nand from CUTLASS radar in Hankasalmi (Finland). Further,\nwe analyze in detail the distinctive features in the behavior of\nionospheric plasma parameters, particularly the electron den-\nsity Ne and electron temperature Te, from the European In-\ncoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at Troms\u00f8, pointing in\nthe MZ. Finally, we discuss and explain the results obtained.\n2 Experimental arrangement\nThe experiment reported here was conducted on 13 October\n2006 from 15:00 to 19:00 UT. The EISCAT HF heating fa-\ncility (Rietveld et al., 1993) located near Troms\u00f8 in Northern\nNorway (geographical coordinates 69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E; mag-\nnetic dip angle I=78\u25e6) was used to perturb the ionosphere in\nthe high-latitude F-region. The heating facility was operat-\ning at 4040 kHz, in O-mode polarization, with a modulation\ncycle of 2 min on\/2 min off. The phased array 2 was used,\nresulting in an effective radiated power (ERP) of 190 MW.\nThe HF heater antenna beam was tilted 12\u25e6 to the south of\nzenith, thus allowing HF pumping in the field\u2013aligned direc-\ntion (magnetic zenith, MZ).\nThe HF heating facility at Troms\u00f8 is located adjacent to\nthe EISCAT UHF incoherent radar at 930 MHz (Rishbeth and\nvan Eyken, 1993). In the course of the experiment the UHF\nradar antenna was directed towards magnetic zenith.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 131\u2013145, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/131\/2009\/\nN. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: HF pumping towards magnetic zenith 133\nBi-static HF Doppler radio scatter observations were car-\nried out on the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg path at an op-\nerational frequency of 17 640 kHz. In accordance with the\nBragg condition, the HF bi-static backscatter is sensitive to\nsmall-scale irregularities having spatial sizes of the order of\n9 m across the geomagnetic field. The diagnostic transmitter\nis located near London (52\u25e6 N, 0\u25e6 E) at a great circle dis-\ntance of \u223c2200 km from Troms\u00f8. The reception of the diag-\nnostic waves scattered from field-aligned irregularities over\nTroms\u00f8 was made with a Doppler spectral method in St. Pe-\ntersburg (60\u25e6 N, 30\u25e6 E) at a distance of \u223c1200 km (with a\ndouble rhombic receiving antenna directed towards Troms\u00f8).\nThe spectral processing was carried out by using a windowed\n(Hanning) fast Fourier transformation (FFT). In the course\nof the Troms\u00f8 experiment described here, a sampling rate\nof 102 Hz allowed a spectral analysis bandwidth of 51 Hz.\nA specified number of 512 FFT coefficients provided a fre-\nquency resolution of 0.1 Hz. Each segment used for the FFT\nwas overlapped by 50%, which yielded the production of a\nDoppler spectrum every 5 s. The mechanism of bi-static scat-\nter is very similar to direct backscatter, but with the transmit-\nter and receiver at different locations. The azimuth angle be-\ntween the incident and scattered wave vectors is about 120\u25e6\non the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg path.\nSimultaneous CUTLASS data are also available from\nHankasalmi, Finland radar (63\u25e6 N, 27\u25e6 E). CUTLASS (Co-\noperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System) is a\npair of HF coherent backscatter radar located in Finland and\nIceland and forms part of the SuperDARN array (Greenwald\net al., 1995; Milan et al., 1997; Lester et al., 2004). In the\ncourse of the experiment CUTLASS operated at three fre-\nquencies of about 10, 11.5 and 13.2 MHz. Note that CUT-\nLASS was running a non-standard scan for heating. The\nHankasalmi radar had 15 km range gates, with the first gate\nstarting at a range of 480 km. The beam integration time was\n3 s. The scan was restricted to beams from 3 to 7, and a\nthree-frequency sweep was used.\nThe status of the ionosphere in the course of the experi-\nment was checked by an ionosonde (dynasonde) at Troms\u00f8\n(Rietveld et al., 2008). Ionograms were taken every two min-\nutes. The viewing geometry is shown in Fig. 1.\n3 Observational results\nWe have analysed HF heater-induced phenomena in the F-\nregion of the ionosphere. The analysed period was limited\nto 15:00 to 15:30 UT, since after 15:30 UT transmission to\nthe F-region was blocked by absorption\/reflection in the E-\nregion in which very high electron densities were observed.\nIonograms obtained on 13 October 2006 during heater-off\nand heater-on periods are presented in Fig. 2a and b, re-\nspectively. Significant spreading in the F2 layer took place\nthroughout the experiment, which is indicative of patchy\nplasma densities. In the course of the experiment, the iono-\n \nFig. 1 \n \nFig. 1.

The London-St. Peters-\nburg direct path is shown on the map by a thin line. The viewing\ngeometry of the Hankasalmi CUTLASS HF coherent scatter radar\nis also presented on the map.\ngrams obtained showed that the critical frequencies of the F2\nlayer foF2 changed from 4.2 MHz at 14:58 UT to 3.4 MHz at\n15:20 UT. The first three ionograms obtained during heater-\non periods (see Fig. 2b) appear to be weaker, because of an\nincreased HF noise floor when the heater is on, especially\nnear the heater frequency, which happens to be near foF2.\nFor these events, to estimate HF-induced variations in the\nF-region electron density we used fxF2 and calculated the\nmaximum plasma density from that and the electron gyro fre-\nquency at the corresponding altitude. In this case the values\nobtained for fmaxF2 during the heater-on periods were about\n4.35, 4.25, 4.3, and 3.75 MHz in the first, second, third, and\nfourth heater-on periods, respectively.\nFigure 3 displays dynamic Doppler spectra of HF diag-\nnostic signals on the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg path\nat an operational frequency of 17 640 kHz on 13 October\n2006 from 14:59 to 15:16 UT.

The heater-on\nperiod from 15:08\u201315:10 UT is the last with backscatter at an\noperational frequency of 13.2 MHz, and 15:12\u201315:14 UT is\nthe last with backscatter at frequencies of 10 and 11.5 MHz.\nComparing the occurrence of striations from Figs. 3 and\n5 and Troms\u00f8 dynasonde data (Fig. 2a), it can be seen that\nafter the first heater-on period at 15:02 UT, the critical fre-\nquency of F2 layer was foF2=4.2 MHz. After the second one\nat 15:06 UT, it was 4.1 MHz. After the third heater-on pe-\nriod at 15:10 UT it was about 3.9 MHz, and after the fourth\nheater-on period at 15:14 UT it was 3.7 MHz.\nFigure 6 presents data from the EISCAT UHF radar data at\nTroms\u00f8 on 13 October 2006 from 14:58 to 15:30 UT as the\nUHF radar beam pointed in the MZ, showing the effects of\nHF pumping. One can clearly see the strong electron temper-\nature Te increases (second panel) closely related to the first\nfour heater-on periods in which the heater-induced striations\nwere observed both from bi-static HF Doppler radio scatter\nand from the CUTLASS radar. In Fig. 6 white horizontal\nlines near the reflection height of the HF pump wave (most\nlikely at the upper hybrid resonance altitude) in the Ne, Te,\nTi , and Vi panels show data with a high residual to the fit-\nting. The residual is a measure of deviations, the difference\nbetween the observed and theoretical curve fits to the radar\necho spectra. In such time intervals, closely related to the\nfirst three heater-on periods, strongly enhanced ion-acoustic\nand even central line peaks in the spectra were observed.\nThis is typical of strong Langmuir turbulence. The altitude of\nthis heater-induced Langmuir turbulence was about 230 km,\nand did not change during the experiment. It is important to\nnote that at the altitude of 230 km the pump frequency is just\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/131\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 131\u2013145, 2009\n136 N. F.

The\nCUTLASS Hankasalmi radar was running a non-standard scan for\nheating. It had 15 km range gates, with the first gate starting at a\nrange of 480 km. The EISCAT\/HEATING facility transmitted from\n15:00\u201315:02, 15:04\u201315:06, 15:08\u201315:10, and 15:12\u201315:14 UT.\nbelow the third electron gyro harmonic. Although the single\naltitude range-gate (230 km altitude), in which the HF-driven\ninstability leads to a strong ion-line enhancement, is difficult\nto analyze for temperatures and densities, adjacent altitudes\ncan be used to examine plasma responses.\nTemporal variations of the electron density Ne, ion and\nelectron temperatures, Ti and Te, and ion velocities Vi at al-\ntitudes of 214, and 264 km from the EISCAT UHF radar ob-\nservations on 13 October 2006 from 14:58 to 15:15 UT are\nshown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. Figure 8 shows the\ntemporal variations of EISCAT UHF radar residuals at the\nthree altitudes of 230, 214, and 264 km. Note that the data\nwith a residual of more than 2 cannot be trusted. From Fig. 8\nresiduals at altitudes of 214 and 264 km stayed mainly be-\nlow the threshold value of 2. At 230 km the residuals were\nmore than 2.0 in parts of the first three heater-on periods. In\nFig. 7a, b note particularly the following features: Increases\nin electron temperature Te were observed at the two altitudes\nin the first four heater-on periods from 15:00\u201315:02, 15:04\u2013\n15:06, 15:08\u201315:10, 15:12\u201315:14 UT. During the first three\nheater-on periods, when HF pumping was produced near the\ncritical frequency foF2, Te increases were accompanied by\nreal electron density enhancements up to 25%, at the alti-\ntudes immediately above and below 230 km. At 214 km the\ndefined Ne increases occurred in the first and second heater-\non periods, and at 264 km they were observed in the first and\nthird heater-on periods.\nWe note with respect to the electron temperature Te, mea-\nsured by the UHF radar, that the last clearly enhanced Te was\nmeasured during the HF-on period from 15:12\u201315:14 UT, but\ncontrary to the first three heater-on periods this Te enhance-\nment was not accompanied by an increase in the Ne. The\nfirst HF-on cycle during and after which no detectable Te en-\nhancement was seen was from 15:16\u201315:18 UT.\nFigure 9 presents the temporal variations of electron den-\nsity from both the maximum of the F2 layer and from\n214 km, as estimated from the Ne(h) profiles obtained from\nthe Troms\u00f8 dynasonde data (see Fig. 2a, b). Recall that\nduring heater-on periods we used fxF2 and calculated the\nmaximum plasma density from it and the electron gyro fre-\nquency at the corresponding altitude. From Fig. 9 we note\nthat some enhancements in the electron density were also ob-\nserved from dynasonde data in the first three heater-on peri-\nods. As a whole, values of electron densities are less than or\ncomparable to UHF radar measurements in the MZ.\nFigure 10a\u2013d presents electron density profiles Ne(h) from\nheater-on (red line) and preceding heater-off (blue line) pe-\nriods obtained from UHF radar measurements for the first,\nsecond, third, and fourth heating cycles respectively. The\nclearest heater-induced effects in the plasma density are seen\nin the first three heater-on periods in a wide altitude range of\nup to 100 km.\n4 Discussion\nWe have considered multi-instrument observational data\nfrom an experiment on 13 October 2006 at the EIS-\nCAT\/HEATING facility at Troms\u00f8, Norway, when the elec-\ntron density in the F-region dropped and the heater frequency\nwas near and then above the critical frequency of the F2 layer.\nIn the course of the experiment the pump frequency was very\nclose to and just below the third electron gyro harmonic fre-\nquency.

Temporal variations of residuals of EISCAT UHF radar data\nat altitudes of 214, 230, and 264 km.\nElectron heating by the upper hybrid resonance, creating\nAFAIs, always leads to decreased electron density in the stri-\nations. This decreased density in turn further focuses HF ra-\ndio waves into plasma density depletions. Hence the AFAIs\ngrow nonlinearly, forming bunches of striations (Gurevich\net al., 1998). If the pump HF radio waves propagate suf-\nficiently close to parallel to Earth\u2019s magnetic field B, the\nwaves can be trapped, thereby depositing most of the HF\nenergy in the plasma (Gurevich et al., 2001). Observations\nwhich confirm this prediction were made simultaneously at\nEISCAT\/HEATING facility at Troms\u00f8 (Leyser et al., 2000;\nKosch et al., 2002; Rietveld et al., 2003) and HAARP (Peder-\nsen and Carlson, 2001; Gurevich et al., 2002; Pedersen et al.,\n2003). This strong enhancement of trapped HF waves near\nparallel to B, leading to the magnetic zenith effect, has since\nbeen studied at these and other HF facilities. Several such\nstudies have focused on optical emissions. It was shown that\nHF-induced airglow maximizes during HF pumping towards\nmagnetic zenith (Kosch et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2003).\nThe same is true for some Langmuir turbulence phenomena,\nwhich also show a strong preference for excitation by pump\nHF radio waves in the field-aligned direction (Isham et al.,\n1999). The generation of strong Langmuir turbulence with\nupper hybrid waves as the primary source of Langmuir waves\nhas been proposed by Mishin et al.

They also showed that large electron temperature in-\ncreases of 3000 K above the background were accompanied\nby ion heating of about 100 K, and electron density decreases\nof up to 20%. Here we add insights for the HF pump-induced\nphenomena when the HF heater frequency on the one hand\nwas very close to the third electron gyro harmonic frequency,\nand on the other hand was near the critical frequency of the\nF2 layer.\nWe observe plasma density increases by up to 25%. Such\nplasma density increases might result from three mecha-\nnisms which we examine below: (1) Changed temperature-\ndependent reaction rates, leading to transiently changed\nplasma density (Sipler and Bionde, 1972). (2) Redistribu-\ntion of thermal plasma due to changed electron gas temper-\nature and diffusion rates (Meltz and LeLevier, 1970). (3)\nEnhanced production of ionization by accelerated electrons\n(Carlson, 1993).\n(1) Temperature-dependent reaction rates: Sipler and\nBiondi (1972) measured a transient decrease in 630.0 nm\nemission at Arecibo, due to an HF heater-induced increase\nin electron temperature, and explained this as a consequence\nof transient reduction in dissociative recombination.

It leads to a momentary decrease\nin O(1D) concentration, 630.0 nm emission, dissociative re-\ncombination, and thus to a transient increase of plasma den-\nsity, after which the rate-limiting charge transfer from atomic\noxygen ions restores the initial steady-state plasma density.\nWe must test whether this process can explain the transient\nplasma density increase here. The formula for the tempera-\nture dependence and the coefficient for the density suppres-\nsion, which they used for that calculation and which fit the\ndata, has since been updated as per Schunk and Nagy (2000)\nfor temperatures above 1200 K, yet gives essentially the same\nnumerical values. Here we must replace the Sipler and\nBiondi (1972) oxygen-ion-only calculation by total ion den-\nsity, and calculate plasma density changes for our conditions,\nwhere the electron temperature changes will be significantly\ngreater than the 1972 Arecibo data and thus temperature-\ndependent change will likewise be greater than the 1.3% seen\nat Arecibo.

The [N2] and [O] densities for corre-\nsponding altitude were taken from the MSIS model (http:\n\/\/omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov\/vitmo\/msis vitmo.html). The cal-\nculations give electron density increases from 2.4 to 5.3%,\ndepending on the altitude and Te enhancements. These cal-\nculations ignoring transport (discussed below) give an upper\nlimit to the impact of this process.\nA more straightforward proof derives from the direct com-\nparison with observations on the preceding day, 12 October.\nWe compared results obtained on 13 October 2006 with data\ncollected during our experiment on 12 October 2006, which\nbears a close resemblance to the one discussed here. It was\nconducted in the same time-of-day, HF pumping was also\nproduced towards MZ, the same heater frequency and mod-\nulation were used, and the UHF radar was in operation. We\nhave examined the plasma density and electron temperature\non both days. Figure 11a, b shows data from two range gates,\nboth of which are free of any HF ion-line enhancement. The\nFig. 11a, b data from the EISCAT UHF radar observations on\n12 October 2006 from 15:28 to 15:52 UT, when the F2 layer\ncritical frequency fell through fH on this day, presents tem-\nporal variations of the electron density Ne, ion and electron\ntemperatures Ti and Te, and ion velocities Vi , at altitudes of\n214 and 264 km. We look first at the changes in the electron\ndensity on 12 October (Fig. 11b), and find no convincing ev-\nidence of any increase at 264 km. The next day, 13 October\n(see Fig. 7b) showed an increase in electron density in the\nfirst and third heater-on periods. In fact the Te increase for\n13 October (see Fig. 7b) was less, being heated from roughly\n2300 to 3500 K (\u223c50%), vs. from roughly 1800 to 3200 K\n(80%) on 12 October (see Fig. 11b). No detectable changes\nin ion temperatures were observed near these altitudes on ei-\nther day. (Note: The higher unheated base electron temper-\nature on 13 October was consistent with the slightly lower\nplasma density. On 12 October the background electron den-\nsity was larger, foF2 from dynasonde data at Troms\u00f8 was\nabout 4.4 MHz). By this electron temperature-dependent ef-\nfect alone, if the 13 October plasma density increase was due\nto electron gas temperature changes, 12 October would show\neven greater plasma density increases. In fact no noticeable\nincrease in plasma density was seen. The behavior of elec-\ntron density at the altitude of 214 km (Figs. 7a and 11a) is\nsimilar to those observed at the altitude of 264 km. Thus we\ncannot explain the 13 October plasma density increase by\nthis effect, consistent with the detailed calculations.\nThus we conclude from both the data alone and from the\nmodel calculations, that the Ne enhancement on 13 October\n2006 by 25% cannot be explained by temperature-dependent\nreaction rates.\n(2) Redistribution of thermal plasma: Meltz and LeLe-\nvier (1970) did the first estimate of how long it would\ntake for this diffusion-constrained redistribution to measur-\nably change plasma densities during HF heating experi-\nments. Plasma transport by hydrodynamic expansion of\nheated plasma along magnetic field lines is a well established\nfact. Here after turn-on in heating experiments, the response\ntime to the temperature-dependent pressure gradient is lim-\nited by ion drag that is, ions diffusing through neutral parti-\ncles. Plasma density would decrease slightly at the peak den-\nsity and increase above and below the peak. The response\ntime, from 5 to 10 min or more, is found to be much too\nsluggish to explain our observations for this 2 min on\/2 min\noff cycle. Because of this the only argument remains for an\nincrease in plasma density.\n(3) Enhanced production of ionization: Carlson (1993)\npredicted measurable increases in plasma density to be feasi-\nble, due to enhanced production of ionization by accelerated\nelectrons, once HF heating facilities reached the GW class of\neffective radiated power (ERP) densities. This quantitative\nprediction was based on calculations for achieving HF en-\nergy densities approaching that of solar EUV in the F-region,\nand finding means to efficiently convert the HF energy to the\nsuprathermal electron energy through electron acceleration\nprocesses.\nThe key arguments from that work (Carlson, 1993) are\nas follows: (1) The electron production rate by the sun for\na sunspot number of 60 is 103 cm\u22123 s\u22121, spread in altitude\nover order 100 km, representing \u223c4\u00d710\u22128 W cm\u22122. (2) A\nGW ERP HF facility would deliver about of \u223c10\u22127 W cm\u22122\nnear the F-region peak altitude. (3) The efficiency of conver-\nsion of HF energy to the electron energy accelerated above\nthe ionization threshold for effective ionization production\n(taking \u223c30 eV per ionization) was established by Carlson et\nal. (1982) to be order 10% at order 100 MW ERP. (4) With ju-\ndicious selection of future operating modes, comparable ef-\nficiencies should be realizable, and appreciable production\nof ionization should be seen. We find the observations here\nsupport both that frame of reference and that prediction.\nThat the presence of suprathermal electrons is a standard\nfeature of HF heating experiments at all latitudes is well es-\ntablished experimentally. HF-excited airglow enhancements\nwere first reported at 630.0 nm (Sipler and Biondi, 1972)\nwhere they are most easily seen, but they can be and are\nfound in HF experiments, due to both thermal and acceler-\nated electrons (Carlson, 2002). More sophisticated optical\nexperiments have since unambiguously established optical\nemissions excited at wavelengths that can only be excited by\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/131\/2009\/ Ann.

Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: HF pumping towards magnetic zenith 143\n2002), and are also seen directly in enhanced incoherent scat-\nter radar plasma lines (Carlson et al., 1982).\nThe theory underlying the magnetic zenith effect (Gure-\nvich et al., 2001, 2002) can be succinctly summarized. A res-\nonance instability occurs in the vicinity of the upper hybrid\nfrequency, exciting upper hybrid plasma waves and small\nscale field-aligned plasma depletions, or striations, which\ngrow nonlinearly, reinforced by self focusing. Also, a para-\nmetric instability takes place in the Langmuir resonance re-\ngion near the pump reflection height, where nonlinear pro-\ncesses in Langmuir turbulence create cavitons which acceler-\nate electrons up to tens of eV with the help of electron elastic\nscattering. For launch of high-power HF radio waves suffi-\nciently close to parallel to the magnetic field, the HF propa-\ngation path leads to trapping of the HF rays in the striations,\nwhich can heat sufficiently to allow the HF energy to bore\nup to the reflection height. Striations extend along B both\nabove and below the upper hybrid altitude, and as a result\nnonlinear cavities and cavitons are formed even 20\u201330 km\nfrom the upper hybrid altitude. HF waves effectively trapped\ninside cavities lead to additional heating there. The max-\nimum heating is near the magnetic zenith, as is the inten-\nsity of HF-enhanced incoherent scatter echoes due to Lang-\nmuir waves (as observed by Isham et al., 1999). A signif-\nicant part of the pump wave effectively trapped inside the\ncavity reaches the height of reflection, and by electron accel-\neration produces notable fluxes of accelerated electrons via\nLangmuir turbulence (Gurevich et al., 2004). The essential\nfactor at these HF launch angles towards magnetic zenith is\nthe trapping of the HF radio waves (Gurevich et al., 2001,\n2005), whereby first, a large percent of the total HF energy\nbecomes deposited in the plasma, and second, a significant\nfraction goes into electron acceleration. Calculations based\non this theory have estimated that accelerated electrons can\nabsorb up to tens of percent of the HF ERP (Gurevich et\nal., 2005). Energy deposition and electron acceleration are\nintensified for pumping near the double resonance, and elec-\ntron acceleration is enhanced for operation at multiples of the\nelectron gyro harmonic frequency. We should acknowledge\nthat invoking the above explanations need not exclude other\nelectron acceleration processes from occurring as well. For\nexample, Ashrafi et al. (2007) suggested that upper hybrid\nwaves, which propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field,\nand Langmuir waves, which propagate parallel to the mag-\nnetic field, act simultaneously to accelerate electrons even in\nthe steady state. However the role of Langmuir turbulence\nnear the reflection height in electron acceleration remains\ncentral.\nOn 13 October we observe the increased plasma den-\nsity, for operation very near the double resonance. We ob-\nserve the presence of HF-enhanced ion spectra, which indi-\ncates that HF pump energy is reaching the reflection height,\nwhere Langmuir turbulence can produce fluxes of suprather-\nmal electrons. We are operating very close to the triple of\nthe electron gyro frequency, which should maximize the ef-\nfectiveness of suprathermal electron flux production. We see\nplasma density enhancements for which the only explanation\nwe can identify is the ionization by this suprathermal elec-\ntron flux, and prior calculations verify adequate energy can\nbe available.\nData obtained on 12 October are very similar to the 13\nOctober in terms of its aeronomy and geophysical charac-\nter. Among with it they show no significant plasma den-\nsity enhancement, nor any detectable HF-enhanced ion spec-\ntra, indicating the absence of strong pump energy reaching\nthe reflection height. Thus there is no such mechanism to\nproduce significant suprathermal electron fluxes. While the\ndays are similar for purposes of examining their aeronomy,\nthey are critically different for purposes of examining their\nplasma physics. The experiment on 12 October does not\nhave operation very near the double resonance and the third\ngyro harmonic. On 13 October 2006 the upper hybrid reso-\nnance altitude and the altitude of heater-induced Langmuir\nturbulence was about 230 km, and it did not change dur-\ning the experiment. At the altitude of 230 km, the pump\nfrequency fH=4040 kHz is very close to and just below\nthe third electron gyro harmonic, 3fce=4045 kHz. There-\nfore, in such conditions one would expect double resonance\n(fH=fUHR\u22483fce) effects to pertain, effects which are impor-\ntant to the magnetic zenith and electron acceleration process\n(Gurevich et al., 2001, 2004). In contrast, on 12 October\n2006 the upper hybrid resonance altitude was about 210 km,\nwhere the heater frequency fH was far from 3fce=4079 kHz.\nWe have observed an increase in plasma density dur-\ning a high-power HF experiment pointing towards magnetic\nzenith. Further, we have examined possible sources for this\nionization change, including the publications of Sipler and\nBiondi (1972) and Meltz and LeLevier (1970) and others\nsince, and find only one that can explain our observations.\nCarlson (1993) proposed the production of ionization by\nsuprathermal electrons, and presented calculations showing\nthat the observable plasma density enhancements, provided\nby the efficient conversion of HF energy to the electron flux\nenergy, can occur when enough ERP is transmitted. Gure-\nvich et al. (2001, 2002) proposed a magnetic zenith mecha-\nnism for making a large fraction of the ERP available in the\nplasma production region, and means for the electron accel-\neration. Bernhardt et al. (1989), Djuth et al. (1999, 2005)\nPedersen et al. (2003), Gustavsson et al. (2005), Holma et\nal. (2006), Ashrafi et al. (2007) have also worked on elec-\ntron acceleration mechanisms and experimental evidence for\ntheir presence. Our work here shows the signatures of the\nmagnetic zenith mechanism in terms of both rapid forma-\ntion of striations and strong Langmuir turbulence when the\nplasma-density enhancements were produced. We conclude\nthat the proximity to the double resonance and to the multi-\nple gyro frequency pumping is a key to the effectiveness of\nplasma production through ionization by suprathermal elec-\ntron fluxes accelerated in the strong Langmuir turbulence re-\ngion near the pump height of reflection.

The ex-\nperiment was carried out in the evening hours when the elec-\ntron density in the F-region dropped, and the HF pump fre-\nquency fH was near and then above the critical frequency\nof F2 layer. The distinctive feature of this experiment is that\nthe pump frequency was just below the third electron gyro\nharmonic frequency while both the HF pump beam and UHF\nradar beam were directed towards the magnetic zenith (MZ).\nThe results showed the thermal electron excitation of the HF-\ninduced striations as seen simultaneously from HF bi-static\nscatter and CUTLASS radar observations, accompanied by\nincreases of electron temperature when the heater frequency\nwas near and then above the critical frequency of F2 layer up\nto 0.4 MHz. In addition to strong electron gas heating and\nplasma structuring, we observed measurable plasma density\nenhancements on one of two otherwise similar adjacent days.\nWe explain this plasma density increase by building on prior\nwork and taking the double resonance condition to signif-\nicantly enhance electron acceleration. The increase of the\nelectron density by up to 25%, accompanied by the strong\nHF-induced electron heating, was only observed when the\nheater frequency was near the critical frequency and just be-\nlow the third electron gyro harmonic frequency.\nIn summary, the combined effect of upper hybrid reso-\nnance and gyro resonance at the same altitude gives rise to\nstrong electron heating and excitation of striations, which at\nmagnetic zenith leads to HF ray trapping and extension of\nHF waves to altitudes where they can excite Langmuir turbu-\nlence, leading to fluxes of electrons accelerated to energies\nthat produce measurable ionization.\nAcknowledgements.
