Introduction\n[2] Long\u2010term geophysical processes such as sea level\nchange, tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment may\nbe measured using geodetic GPS coordinate time series. To\nenable such (sub\u2010) millimeter per year order motions to be\nconfidently identified, shorter\u2010term deformation time series\nsignatures caused by loading of the surface of the solid Earth\nfrom the constant redistribution of atmospheric, oceanic and\ncontinental\u2010water masses, must be removed from the time\nseries with suitably accurate geophysical models. Ocean tide\nloading displacements are routinely corrected in geodetic\ndata processing with recent models agreeing to around 1 mm\nor better in all but a few regions of the world [Penna et al.,\n2008]. Atmospheric pressure loading (ATML) predictions,\nfollowing their introduction over 20 years ago, are now\nprovided by several on\u2010line services either as corrections at\nknown geodetic sites or in the form of global grids. van\nDam et al. [1994] found that removing modeled ATML\nfrom GPS heights reduced the variance at 12 of 19 globally\u2010\ndistributed sites and that ATML could account for up to\n24% of the total variance, and later Tregoning and van Dam\n[2005] showed peak to peak vertical displacements of up to\n18 mm for mid\u2010to\u2010high latitude sites and a reduction in\nRMS of up to 2 mm. However, GPS time series are not\nnormally corrected for loading effects of non\u2010tidal water\nredistributions, possibly due to the lack of temporal (monthly\nfor continental water and 12 hourly for ocean) and spatial\n(1\u00b0 or coarser) resolution of readily accessible models and\ntheir estimated contribution is still a subject of debate, with\nonly limited, or somewhat inconclusive, studies undertaken.\nUsing TOPEX\/POSEIDON (T\/P) altimeter data and output\nfrom an oceanic general circulation model to infer changes in\nocean bottom pressure, van Dam et al. [1997] found a typical\nsite RMS of 2 mm in the modeled height displacements for\nsites close to the coast. Munekane and Matsuzaka [2004]\nfound evidence that some vertical movement at three tropi-\ncal Pacific island GPS sites was anti\u2010correlated with T\/P\naltimeter data corrected for steric effects. A reduction in\nheight variance of about 10% for four GPS sites (corrected\nfor ATML) around the Adriatic region was shown by Zerbini\net al. [2004] on applying non\u2010tidal ocean loading (NTOL)\ndisplacements computed using the Estimating the Circulation\nand Climate of the Oceans (ECCO) model, but the modeled\nand observed NTOL differed by a scaling factor of about 2.5.\nNordman et al. [2009], using interpolated monthly sea level\ndata from Baltic tide gauges to compute NTOL, found an\nimprovement in RMS at only one of their three Fennoscandia\nGPS sites and when ATML predictions were also added, they\nfound no overall decrease in RMS. Both Zerbini et al. [2004]\nand Nordman et al. [2009] used \u2018legacy\u2019 GPS analysis meth-\nods, notably using inhomogeneously computed International\nGNSS Service (IGS)\/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) orbits\nrespectively, rather than homogeneous reprocessing incor-\nporating updated error models. W\u00f6ppelmann et al. [2009] for\nexample, found reductions in the noise of such height time\nseries of 30\u201340% compared with \u2018legacy\u2019 processing.\n[3] This paper investigates whether NTOL effects on\ngeodetic GPS height time series are significant and should\n(and can) be modeled in geophysical studies, by considering\nmodeled displacements and 3\u20134 years of homogeneously\nreprocessed GPS data using current error models. We con-\nsider 17 coastal EUREF (www.epncb.oma.be) and NERC\nBIGF (www.bigf.ac.uk) sites around the southern North Sea\n(Figure 1), a region particularly susceptible to storm surges,\nand investigate whether global, coarse spatial and temporal\nresolution ocean models are adequate, or whether finer\nresolution regional models are preferred. As NTOL is cor-\nrelated with atmospheric pressure, we also consider atmo-\nspheric pressure loading (ATML) effects, and the coupling\nbetween NTOL and ATML. As a spin\u2010off, the changes in\nthe precision of the GPS height time series also enable us to\nassess the quality of the ocean models themselves.\n2. Modeling Atmospheric and Non\u2010tidal Ocean\nLoading Displacements\n2.1. Model Data\n[4] To compute the ATML we used the surface pressure\nfields from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\/\n1National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\n2School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle University,\nNewcastle upon Tyne, UK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/11\/2011GL046940\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 38, L09314, doi:10.1029\/2011GL046940, 2011\nL09314 1 of 5\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\/NCAR)\nreanalysis project [Kalnay et al., 1996]. The dataset consists of\na global grid with a 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 spatial and a 6\u2010hourly temporal\nresolution. We handled the problematic S1 and S2 atmospheric\ntides [Ponte and Ray, 2002] by calculating and removing the\n30 year (1978\u20132008) mean for each 6 hourly time step (00 h,\n06 h, 12 h, 18 h). This is exactly equivalent, in a weighted least\nsquares sense, to estimating and removing the mean pressure,\nsine and cosine amplitudes of the S1 tide and the cosine of the\nS2 tide over the entire period; the approach taken by Petrov\nand Boy [2004].\n[5] To compute the NTOL we used the output from two\ndifferent models, a near global ocean circulation model and\na high resolution storm surge model restricted to the\nnorthwest European continental shelf. The first model we\ntested uses the ocean bottom pressure output from model\nkf066b, a data assimilated oceanic general circulation model\nrun at JPL as part of the ECCO consortium [Stammer et al.,\n2002]. The model extends between \u00b180\u00b0 latitude with a\nlongitudinal grid spacing of 1\u00b0, and a latitudinal grid spacing\nof 0.3\u00b0 within 10\u00b0 of the equator that gradually increases to\na 1\u00b0 resolution at \u00b125\u00b0. It is provided at 12 hour sampling,\nwith the values representing an average over 12 hours rather\nthan an instantaneous snapshot. Sea level observations from\nsatellite altimetry are assimilated into the model using a\nKalman filter approach [Fukumori et al., 1999] and the\nmodels are forced with wind stress, surface heat flux and\nevaporation\u2010precipitation fields from the NCEP\/NCAR\nreanalysis. The model uses the Boussinesq approximation\nthat conserves volume rather than mass. This can produce\nunwanted spurious effects which can be reduced by calcu-\nlating and removing the global mean bottom pressure at\neach epoch [Greatbatch, 1994].\n[6] For a second approach to modeling the NTOL we used\nthe UK operational tide\u2010storm surge model, POLSSM\n(Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Storm Surge Model),\nwhich covers the entire northwest European continental\nshelf from 40\u00b0N to 63\u00b0N and from 20\u00b0W to 13\u00b0E (Figure 1)\nat 12 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution [Flather,\n2000]. The surface boundary conditions for this barotropic\nmodel are the mean sea level atmospheric pressure and 10 m\nwind components. Validation of the operational model is\nperformed monthly by comparison with observed sea level\ndata from the UK national tide gauge network and typical\nRMS errors are about 10 cm.\n2.2. Loading Computation\n[7] The loading was calculated by convolving the atmo-\nspheric and non\u2010tidal ocean models with the Green\u2019s func-\ntion for the PREM model, as described by Farrell [1972].\nWe used the SPOTL [Agnew, 1997] program, which uses a\npolar grid centered on the station with grid dimensions\nincreasing with distance from the center. We used degree\none Love numbers such that the implied frame is the center\nof mass of the solid Earth (CE) [Blewitt, 2003].\n[8] The ECCO model does not include atmospheric\npressure forcing, of which the primary response in the\noceans is an inverted barometer (IB) at time scales greater\nthan a few days. Traditionally, the modified IB effect,\nwhereby the net change in mass above the oceans is applied\nevenly across the whole ocean floor [van Dam and Wahr,\n1987], has been applied to the ATML calculations. There-\nfore for continuity and to facilitate comparison with previ-\nous ATML datasets, we attribute this effect to the ATML\nand not the NTOL induced effect. A comparison between\nour ATML displacement time series and those calculated by\nPetrov and Boy [2004] at six European sites showed a\nmaximum standard deviation of the differences of 0.07,\n0.03 and 0.3 mm in north, east and up respectively.\n[9] In order to embed the regional POLSSM ocean model\nin what is essentially a global calculation we must be con-\nscious of global mass conservation. While the dynamics\nwithin the model are well defined, the total mass on the shelf\nis sensitive to the applied open\u2010ocean boundary condition,\nwhich is ignorant of global mass conservation. To achieve\nthis we took advantage of the fact that there is a minimum of\nsea level variability (and, by implication, bottom pressure\nvariability) near the steepest part of the continental slope,\nleading to a decoupling of deep ocean and shelf sea vari-\nability [Hughes and Williams, 2010]. We assumed that the\nmodel correctly represents bottom pressure gradients on the\nshelf, which we defined as the region shallower than 300 m,\nbut that the bottom pressure gradient is zero in the global\nocean outside this depth contour, the latter being equivalent\nto the usual assumption of a passive IB ocean. At each\nepoch, we then added a separate, spatially\u2010uniform bottom\npressure in order to ensure conservation of global ocean\nmass, and continuity of the bottom pressure signal averaged\nalong the 300 m contour. This strategy did however\nnecessitate that the ATML and NTOL calculations are not\nentirely separate (they are for the two global grids), meaning\nthat the ATML is slightly different from that associated with\nthe ECCO model.\n3. GPS Processing\n[10] For the 17 North Sea sites considered, all available\nGPS data during the window 2005.0 to 2009.0 were processed\nin daily 24 hour batches using the GIPSY v5.0 software in\nFigure 1. Regional extent of the extended POLSSM\nmodel. The red line indicates the 300 m ocean depth con-\ntour, with all ocean depths denoted by colors. Red dots\ndenote the locations of the 17 GPS sites within 15 km of\nthe southern North Sea coast used in this study.\nWILLIAMS AND PENNA: NON-TIDAL OCEAN LOADING L09314L09314\n2 of 5\nprecise point positioning mode [Zumberge et al., 1997]. JPL\nreprocessed fiducial\u2010free satellite orbit and clock products\nwere held fixed, estimating one set of coordinates per 24 hour\nbatch, together with receiver clock offsets (white noise) and\ntropospheric zenith residual delays (to ECMWF\u2010derived a\npriori hydrostatic and wet zenith delays) and north\u2010south and\neast\u2010west gradients every 5 minutes. Random walk sigmas of\n3 mm\/\u221ah and 0.3 mm\/\u221ah were applied in the zenith delay and\ngradient estimation, respectively. The VMF1 [Boehm et al.,\n2006] tropospheric mapping function and a 10 degree eleva-\ntion cut\u2010off were used, with absolute satellite and receiver\nantenna phase centre variations and offsets modeled accord-\ning to Schmid et al. [2007], and ocean tide loading displace-\nment corrections (computed using SPOTL and the FES2004\n[Lyard et al., 2006] ocean tide model) applied. Ambiguities\nwere fixed using ambizap v3 [Blewitt, 2008], which rejects\na site on a day if less than 18 hours data are available. The\nresulting daily height estimates were transformed to the IGS\nrealization of ITRF2005 and concatenated to form the\nhomogeneously reprocessed (observed) GPS height time\nseries, typically 3\u20134 years long per site.\n4. Results\n[11] The observed GPS height time series for an example\nsite, TERS, is shown in Figure 2. Also included are the daily\naverages of the ATML displacement and the combined\nATML and NTOL displacement from both the ECCO and\nPOLSSM models. Visually there is a good agreement\nbetween the observed and predicted displacements, although\nthe displacement predicted from the global ECCO model\nappears larger than that predicted from the regional\nPOLSSM model. To assess the effectiveness of the loading\nmodels on the GPS height time series we use the statistical\ntechniques of van Dam and Herring [1994] and van Dam\net al. [1994]. The GPS height variance changes are shown\nin Table 1 for six different scenarios: (i) the predicted\nATML is removed; (ii) the predicted NTOL is removed; (iii)\nthe NTOL is removed after the ATML has been removed\nfrom the GPS heights first; (iv) the ATML is removed after\nthe NTOL has been removed from the GPS heights first;\n(v) both the ATML and the NTOL are removed; (vi) both\nloads are removed after applying scaling parameters that\nmaximize the variance change. Scenario (iii) illustrates how\nmuch extra variance reduction the NTOL creates over the\nmore standard ATML calculation and scenario (iv) illus-\ntrates how much extra variance ATML creates over the\nNTOL. We find that the variance has been reduced in all\ncases except one, namely scenario (ii) for the ECCO model\nat site BORJ. A typical estimate of the uncertainty in the\nvariance change is about 0.4 to 1.5 mm2 and all variance\nchanges except three are significant at the three sigma\nFigure 2.

Also shown in Table 1 are the median\nvariance changes for the 17 sites, the median percentage\nreduction in RMS and the median correlation coefficients\nbetween the modeled series and the GPS observations.\n[12] In all the outlined scenarios, the POLSSM model\noutperforms the ECCO model by around 11%. The reduc-\ntion in variance is slightly bigger for the ATML component\nthan the NTOL but the variance reduction is clearly\nimproved if both loads are applied together, with a median\nchange of 17 mm2 for the POLSSM model, ranging from 12\nto 22 mm2 (over 50% in some cases).\n[13] In scenario (vi) the median estimated scale parameter\nfor the ATML is 1.1 for both ECCO and POLSSM. For the\nNTOL the median scaling parameter is 0.8 for the ECCO\nmodel and leads to an improvement, with the variance\nreduction rising by 1 mm2. This would appear to indicate\nthat the ECCO model is over predicting the bottom pressure,\nand hence displacements, in this region by about 30% (as\nobserved in Figure 2). The coarse resolution of the ECCO\nmodel also means that the eastern half of the English Channel\nis missing and hence nearby sites such as MARG, SHEE and\nSHOE are only loaded by distant grid points. It is not very\nnoticeable in the results but that may be because the missing\nocean partially compensates for the over prediction of the\nloading. For POLSSM the NTOL scaling parameter indicates\nthat the displacements are under predicted by about 10% and\nwe find a variance reduction increase of around 0.5 mm2.\n5. Discussion and Conclusions\n[14] We have shown that geodetic homogeneously repro-\ncessed GPS height time series for sites around the southern\nNorth Sea exhibit NTOL effects of comparable size to\nATML. For island sites such as HELG and TERS the NTOL\nvariance reduction is greater than that due to ATML (over 4\ntimes greater for HELG). For more inland sites such as\nNEWC, DELF and sites situated within estuaries or bays, the\nATML is dominant. Together, NTOL and ATML can reduce\nthe GPS height variance by 12 to 22 mm2 (35\u201354%), much\ngreater than the negligible improvement reported by\nNordman et al. [2009], and equivalent to an RMS reduction\nof around 20\u201330%. The variance reduction arising from\nNTOL, having already removed ATML, reaches up to 44%\n(for HELG), much greater than the 10% reductions reported\nby Zerbini et al. [2004]. Clearly NTOL corrections should be\napplied to GPS measurements used in geophysical studies,\nbut which is not normally undertaken by GPS analysts,\nincluding key geophysical providers such as the IGS Anal-\nysis Centers, even in their reprocessing. Implementing such\ncorrections will decrease the time required to detect changes\nin mean sea level, improve our ability to measure transients,\nand increase the correlation between GPS and GRACE\u2010based\nestimates of elastic deformation due to hydrological loading\n[e.g., Tregoning et al., 2009].\n[15] Maximum geophysical benefit of GPS measurements\nwill only be obtained (at least for shallow seas such as the\nsouthern North Sea) if NTOL effects are removed using\nhigh resolution models such as POLSSM (12 km grid),\nalthough such models are not readily available. We have\ndemonstrated that the global 1\u00b0 grid ECCO model (kf066b)\ncan provide a useful first order approach, although the dis-\nplacements had to be scaled by 0.8 to maximize the height\ntime series variance reduction and hence the ECCO model\noverpredicts NTOL in the southern North Sea (Zerbini et al.\nTable 1.

Meanwhile, for POLSSM the overall vari-\nance reduction was 11% greater than when using ECCO,\nand at sites TERS and BORJ the reductions were improved\nby 33% and 63% respectively. These results highlight the\nusefulness of a high\u2010resolution model (even if lacking in\nglobal coverage) compared to a low\u2010resolution global model.\nThe results also provide integrated checks on the ocean\nmodels using an independent dataset, which could be used\nto help refine such models in the future.\n[16] Acknowledgments.
