It is a signal of \nanomaly.  \n \n(Dr Claire Sturge quoted by Black J in Re D, para. 61) \n \nThis case comment seeks to examine the family form rhetoric in the High Court case \nof Re D (contact and parental responsibility: Lesbian mothers and known father) \n[2006] EWHC 2 (Fam), [2006] 1 FCR 556.  Specifically, the comment seeks to relate \nthe concept of the two-parent \u2018sexual family\u2019 (Fineman, 1995, pp.143-176), as the \nmeans of legitimising and organising familial relations, to the decision in Re D.  In Re \nD, the High Court granted a restricted form of parental responsibility to the applicant \nand child\u2019s biological father, Mr B.  The respondents, Ms A and Ms C\u2014a lesbian \ncouple who are D\u2019s co-mothers and primary carers\u2014objected to the application.  By \nawarding Mr B a contingent form of parental responsibility, Judge Black felt that he \n 2 \nwas taking a \u2018creative\u2019 approach to parental responsibility that would accommodate \nMr B\u2019s need to be recognised as D\u2019s father, as well as reflecting the \u2018paramount \nposition of the family comprising the two mothers and the [child]\u2019 (para. 93).  Re D is \na notable case for several reasons.  Firstly, it directly situates parental responsibility in \nthe context of parental status and recognition, as opposed to its more traditional \npresentation as a practical tool for parenting.  The \u2018creative\u2019 use of parental \nresponsibility in Re D further reflects the current inadequacy of legal terminology in a \nsociety where parenthood increasingly occurs outside the confines of the traditional \nnuclear family.  This has contributed to the growing significance of obtaining an \naward of parental responsibility in the absence of any alternative recognition or grant \nof status that may better suit a particular parenting role.  Secondly, while arguably \naffording further and welcomed legal recognition to same-sex parenting and families, \nthe judgment in Re D emphasises the limited form of this increased recognition and its \ndependence on a sexually intimate couple as opposed to care and\/or dependency \nrelations.  Thirdly, in positioning Mr B as a potential threat to the security of the \nprimary family unit, we see a shift in legal attitude towards fatherhood, which has \ntraditionally been constructed as fomenting family security.  This shift however is \nperhaps of limited applicability, materialising only when the child is already located \nwithin a sexual family unit.   In Re D, we also see a legal deference to the significance \nand recognition of genetic fatherhood, begging the question, to what extent have \ndominant notions of fatherhood really changed? \n \n \nBackground and Legal Issue \n \n 3 \nThe history of Re D is that Ms A and Ms C decided they would like to raise a child \ntogether.  Wanting the child to have a father figure, they advertised for a man who \nwould be interested in (physically) fathering a child with them.  Mr B came forward \nand in 2000, D was born after sexual intercourse took place between Ms A and Mr B.  \nIt is unclear from the case how the parties reached their decision to pursue the \narrangement, or to what extent they explicitly discussed how parental status and roles \nwould be manifest.  However, no formal agreement was made and when D was born \nconflict soon arose when it became clear that there was disparity in relation to the \nenvisioned extent of Mr B\u2019s direct involvement with D.  Mr B expected to have much \nmore of a parenting role than Ms A and Ms C intended.  Although seeking to \nencourage a direct father-child relationship between Mr B and D, Ms A and Ms C \nwanted this to be through \u2018relatively infrequent visits and benign and loving interest\u2019 \nas opposed to \u2018something of the role of the absent parent after divorce\u2019 (per Black J at \npara. 5).   \nThe parties first came to court in 2001 when Mr B applied for contact with D \nand a parental responsibility order under the Children Act 1989.  At this time, there \nwas a considerable amount of mistrust and resentment between the two parties.  This \nwas attributable to not only their disparate visions, but also Mr B\u2019s excessive and \noften inappropriate reactions to the conflict, such as incessant phone calls, frequent \naccusatory postcards and claims that he would oust Ms C (D\u2019s non-biological mother) \nwhen he obtained parental responsibility for D.  The presiding judge, Black J, \nindicated that he would not be prepared to award Mr B parental responsibility at this \nstage.  Mr B\u2019s application for parental responsibility was therefore adjourned.  \nHowever, Black J did make provision for limited monthly contact between Mr B and \nD.  While Mr B\u2019s behaviour since D\u2019s birth had not been helpful, Black J was \n 4 \nencouraged by his more recent efforts to regain control of his emotions, such as by \nattending counselling.  Black J felt that although it was important that any decision he \nmade regarding contact should reflect and foster the security of D\u2019s primary family \nunit with Ms A and Ms C (para. 9), Mr B was still an important figure in D\u2019s life and \nthat it would be in D\u2019s best interests to have contact with him (para. 10).  By the time \nRe D reached the court again in 2006, the issue of contact between Mr B and D\u2014\nwhich had been increased over time by agreement between the parties\u2014had been \nreasonably settled.  The legal issue now in polarised dispute was whether Mr B should \nbe granted parental responsibility, alongside Ms A and Ms C.  Given D\u2019s current \nliving arrangements and Ms A and Ms C\u2019s opposition to Mr B having parental \nresponsibility, applying for a parental responsibility order from the court under \nsection 4(1)(c) of the Children Act 1989 was the most appropriate course of action for \nMr B.  Whether or not to award him the order was the legal issue in Re D.   \n \n \nConsidering Parental Responsibility \n \nObtaining Parental Responsibility \nIt is worth here considering how particular adults obtain parental responsibility, to \nhelp stress the significance of the concept of the sexual family in the legal regulation \nof families.  While the legislative framework is somewhat flexible (see sections 2(5)-\n(7) and 3(5), Children Act 1989)\u2014and certainly more so than that of parentage\u2014it \nstill reflects an ideological preference for the (biological and\/or legal) sexual family \nby making it more straightforward for those who are within its boundaries to obtain \nparental responsibility.  To demonstrate, women who give birth are automatically \n 5 \ngranted parental responsibility (section (2)(1) and 2(2)(a), Children Act 1989), as are \nmarried fathers (section 2(1), Children Act 1989).  As D\u2019s full biological mother, this \nis how Ms A obtained parental responsibility.  Biological fathers, who like Mr B were \nnot married to the child\u2019s legal mother at the time of birth, can directly apply for \nparental responsibility and have been able to do so since the Children Act 1989 came \ninto force.  They can either make a formal agreement with the child\u2019s mother (section \n4(1)(b), Children Act 1989), or apply for a parental responsibility order or a residence \norder from the court (sections 4(1)(c) and 12(1), Children Act 1989).  While much \nattention has been given to the difference between how married and unmarried fathers \nobtain parental responsibility (see Sheldon 2001), it is important to recognise that only \nbiological fathers\u2014as opposed to social parents and carers\u2014 have been able to apply \ndirectly for parental responsibility since the enactment of the Children Act 1989.  In \naddition, since 1 December 2003, if an unmarried biological father jointly registers \nthe child\u2019s birth with the mother, he will automatically be granted parental \nresponsibility upon registration (section 4(1)(a), Children Act 1989).\n1\n  Therefore, \nwhile the Children Act 1989 may have entrenched the \u2018naturalness\u2019 of the marital \nfamily unit, the biological imperatives of the sexual family unit have also been \nafforded special recognition.  Similarly, under recent legislative reforms, step-parents \nand civil partners are now entitled to apply directly for parental responsibility under \nthe newly inserted sections 4A and 4A(1) of the Children Act 1989.  Clearly these \nnew reforms give welcomed legal recognition to non-biological parents who \nundertake a parenting role with respect to a partner\u2019s \u2018natural\u2019 child\u2014but only if they \nhave a legally valid partnership with that person.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n This legislative reform was not retrospective.  Therefore, even if Mr B was named as D\u2019s father on \nher birth certificate (which is not discussed in the case), he still has to take formal action in order to \nobtain parental responsibility. \n 6 \nNon-biological parents, who like Ms C do not have a legally recognised \nrelationship with a child\u2019s natural parent, have tended to rely on residence orders to \nobtain parental responsibility (see Re G (Children) [2005] EWCA (Civ) 462).  In Re \nD, Ms A and Ms C were awarded a joint residence order (section 12(2), Children Act \n1989) at the conclusion of the 2001 hearing.  Although section 114 of the Adoption \nand Children Act 2002 amends section 12 of the Children Act 1989 to enable the \ncourt to direct that a residence order made in favour of any person who is not a \n(biological) parent to continue in force until the child reaches 18, how this will affect \njoint residence orders is not yet clear.  Therefore, it may well be that unlike Ms A\u2019s \npermanent award of parental responsibility, Ms C\u2019s current award of parental \nresponsibility is dependent upon the joint residence order remaining in force.  If Ms C \nwere to become Ms A\u2019s civil partner, and apply directly for parental responsibility, \nher award would remain in force until otherwise directed by the court, as with the \nparental responsibility orders awarded to unmarried biological fathers.  In other \nwords, for a parental responsibility award not to be contingent on another award under \nthe children Act 1989 being in place, the adult must be within the boundary of the \nsexual family unit, either through a biological connection, or by formalising their \nintimate relationship with a child\u2019s \u2018natural\u2019 parent. \n \nThe Concept of Parental Responsibility \nBefore we discuss the desirability of Mr B being granted the order, it is worth first \nconsidering the actual concept and purpose of having parental responsibility.  Parental \nresponsibility was introduced into statute by the Children Act 1989.  Its introduction \nwas intended to signal a shift in emphasis from parental power and rights, to parental \ncare (see Lowe and Douglas, 2007, pp. 369-70).  The relationship between parental \n 7 \nrights and responsibilities has been addressed in detail by various commentators since \nthe Children Act 1989 came into force (see McCall Smith, 1990; Eekelaar, 1991, \n1994; Bainham, 1994).  What is important for the purposes of this comment is to \nappreciate that the introduction of parental responsibility was intended to foster the \nnotion that, \n \n\u2026the duty to care for the child and to raise him to moral, physical and emotional \nhealth is the fundamental task of parenthood and the only justification for the \nauthority that it confers. \n \n(Department of Health, Introduction to the Children Act 1989, HMSO: 1989: \npara.1.4) \n \nIt would seem to follow then that the function of parental responsibility is to enable \nsomeone to act as a parent by legally conferring to them the ability to make decisions \nabout a child\u2019s care and upbringing.  In other words, vest someone with the legal \nauthority to act as a social parent.  However, as the very definition of parental \nresponsibility suggests, parental rights and responsibilities remain intertwined terms \n(see further Bainham, 1999, pp.33-35; Lowe and Douglas, 2007, 377-408): \n \n\u2026 \u2018parental responsibility\u2019 means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibility and \nauthority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property. \n \n(Section 3(1) of the Children Act 1989) \n \nPractically, we can easily see how rights and responsibilities may be acted on \nsimultaneously, particularly in the context of a parent(s) seeking to exercise their care \nof the child without the interference from the state or another parent(s).  However, as \nLowe and Douglas note, the judiciary have further endorsed the idea that parental \n 8 \nresponsibility confers not just rights as well as responsibilities, but also a type of \nstatus (2007, p.375).  Black J made early reference to this in Re D by quoting Butler \nSloss LJ in his elaboration of the concept from the Children Act 1989 definition: \n \nParental responsibility is a question of status and is different in concept from the \norders which may be made under s 8 in Pt II of the Children Act.  The grant of the \napplication declares the status of the applicant as the father of that child.  It has the \nimportant implications for a father whose child might for example be the subject of an \nadoption application or a Hague Convention application.  In each of those examples, \na father with parental responsibility would have the right to be heard on the \napplication.  \n \n(Para. 20, quote from Re H (a minor) (parental responsibility) [1998] 2 FCR 89) \n \nWhether or not we agree that parental responsibility should (or does) confer a type of \nstatus, what is clear is that the status is contingent upon being able to exercise certain \n\u2018rights\u2019.  Re D then is particularly noteworthy, given that Mr B was granted (at his \nown suggestion) an award of parental responsibility that prescribed how and when he \ncould exercise his parental \u2018rights\u2019 in relation to D\u2019s education and medical treatment.  \nThese are two significant areas of a child\u2019s upbringing, and parental responsibility is \nneeded if an adult is to be entitled to make related decisions or be consulted (see \nsection 2(7), Children Act 1989).  Having parental status through legal parentage does \nnot create similar entitlements.  We can therefore appreciate the significance of an \naward of parental responsibility for someone who wants their parental status to mean \nmore (even if not day-to-day care) than having their name on a birth certificate, or \nhaving a certain status with respect to succession law.  An award of parental \nresponsibility is of even more significance when that person\u2019s parental role is in \ndispute, or where parental relationships are likely to break down (see para. 48). \n 9 \nHowever, under the award granted in Re D, Mr B could not visit or contact D\u2019s school \nwithout the prior written consent of Ms A or Ms C, nor contact any health \nprofessional involved in D\u2019s medical care without similar consent.  Given that D\u2019s \nschooling and medical care were two of the main areas of conflict between the parties, \nwe are left questioning the tangible effects of granting him this particular parental \nresponsibility order.  While his award evidently creates other \u2018rights\u2019 beyond the \nmedical and education context (see Bainham, 1999, 33-35), most of these were not in \ndispute.\n2\n  Re D therefore, is perhaps the first case to really locate parental \nresponsibility in the context of pure status, given that his award was effectively \n\u2018stripped of practical effect\u2019 (per Black J, para. 21).  This leaves us questioning \nwhether or not Mr B should really have been granted the award given the fundamental \nnature of the pre-conditions, or why Black J did not instead regulate the award \nthrough a \u2018prohibited steps\u2019 or \u2018specific issue\u2019 order (section 8, Children Act 1989)?  \n \nThe Decision: Awarding Parental Responsibility Orders \nTraditionally, the decision whether or not to award a parental responsibility order has \nbeen based on a consideration of the unmarried biological father\u2019s \u2018commitment\u2019, \n\u2018attachment\u2019 and \u2018motivation\u2019 (see Re H (minors) (rights of putative fathers) (No 2) \n[1991] FCR 361; sub nom Re H (minors) (local authority: parental rights) [1991] 2 \nAll ER 185), guided by whether or not the order is in the child\u2019s best interests (section \n1, Children Act 1989).  Perhaps because of the amorphous nature of the best interest \nprinciple, the courts have concentrated heavily on these three material considerations \n(per Black J, para. 25), and a parental responsibility order tends to be awarded where \nthe biological father has some sort of \u2018positive relationship\u2019 with the child (see further \n                                                 \n2\n Note that the ability to consent\/object to an adoption was another significant \u2018right\u2019 considered by \nBlack J (paras. 21 and 94).  This issue shall be addressed in the discussion section. \n 10 \nSheldon, 2001, p.103).  Given the various precedents, the Child and Family Court \nAdvisory Support Service (CAFCASS) officer recommended that this was a case \nwhere the biological father should be granted parental responsibility, \n \nMr B clearly has a positive relationship with the child, he has demonstrated \ncommitment and given the length of time of his involvement, he is not a threat to Ms \nA and Ms C\u2019s relationship. \n \n(para. 26) \n \nHowever, Black J took the view that this was not a sophisticated enough analysis of \nthe situation and the \u2018novel\u2019 issues it presented.  Black J, instead ordered that expert \nevidence should be obtained, and a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr \nClaire Sturge, was asked, \n \n\u2026to consider the sociological and psychological impact (both in the short and long \nterm) of granting the father parental responsibility (i) on the child (ii) on the primary \nfamily unit and (iii) on society\u2019s perception of the family. \n \n(para. 28) \n \nWhile Black J acknowledged the increased legal recognition of same-sex families in \nhis ruling (para. 30-32), he was receptive to the anxieties held by Ms A and Ms C \nabout the extent to which society would recognise and accept their \u2018family\u2019, \nparticularly the role of Ms C as D\u2019s (non-biological) co-mother (para. 33 and 64).  \nAlthough there is not space in this short comment to discuss the psychiatrist\u2019s report \nin full, it is worth noting that in the absence of any conclusive research as to whether \nawarding Mr B parental responsibility would or would not be in D\u2019s best interests \nwith respect to her development and identity formation (para. 70-74), Dr Sturge \n 11 \ninstead focussed her report on whether awarding Mr B parental responsibility would \naffect the security and integrity of D\u2019s primary (sexual) family unit with Ms A and Ms \nC.  Dr Struge did not make a specific recommendation, but did voice her opinion in \nevidence that \u2018the risks of Mr B having parental responsibility outweighed the \nbenefits\u2019 (para. 84), and that Mr B\u2019s practical commitment to D would be unaffected \nby parental responsibility (para. 71).  Black J provided in his judgement a string of \nquotes from Dr Sturge\u2019s report that reflect her concerns that awarding Mr B parental \nresponsibility would cause tension with D\u2019s primary (sexual) family unit, and \u2018signal \nanomaly\u2019 to both D and society at large.  These are worth quoting in full to help \ndemonstrate how family form became the integral consideration of D\u2019s best interests \nin the case, rather than substantive parenting, which instead received nominal \nattention: \n \nThe more her father is in evidence, the less clear D will be about what constitutes her \nfamily and how viable the unit within which she lives is. \n \nThe more her father is around, the more likely that others will treat the \u201ccentral\u201d \nfamily as incomplete and seek to include the father e.g. in school decisions and \nmedical treatment. \n \nA third parent (and I use the word advisedly) will be confusing for D.  Her sense of \nsecurity will be strongest if she is clear that responsibility for her lies within her \n\u201cnuclear\u201d family. \n \n(para. 81) \n  \nDespite these concerns however, Dr Sturge (like Black J) is sympathetic to Mr B\u2019s \nneed to have an officially recognised role in D\u2019s life, \n \n 12 \nWhat would solve this would be if the father could receive official recognition in \nsome way but not be allowed to involve himself in the nitty gritty of D\u2019s life-the \nparenting couple having rights above his in this area as is, for example, seen in \nspecial guardianship. \n \n(para. 83) \n \nSimilarly, the CAFCASS officer (who thought it in D\u2019s best interests to award the \norder) saw the application as being more about meeting Mr B\u2019s emotional need to be \nrecognised as D\u2019s parent, than affecting the current practicalities of his relationship \nand contact with D (para. 85).  Indeed, he suggested that an award of parental \nresponsibility might, in meeting his need to be recognised, encourage less day-to-day \ninterference from Mr B.  This again reflects the irony of the award in Re D\u2014that Mr \nB should be granted an order that has traditionally been seen as a practical tool for \nparenting, to enable him to take a step back from D\u2019s daily care.  While Black J may \nregard his decision as a \u2018creative\u2019 approach to parental responsibility, we do have to \nconsider what kind of precedent he has created.  To what extent has he shifted the \nboundaries and purpose of an award of parental responsibility?  Alternatively, given \nthe fine-balance of the award being, or not being in D\u2019s best interests, we also have to \nwonder why Black J thought it better to award an order \u2018stripped of practical effect\u2019 as \nopposed to deciding that a non-contingent award should be granted, or that the \napplication should be denied? \n \n \nConcluding Discussion \n \nConsidering Alternative Decisions \n 13 \nA useful way of analysing the decision in Re D may be to consider what the judge \ncould have otherwise decided.  As aforementioned, Black J could have either 1) \ngranted the order without the preconditions, 2) granted the order without the \npreconditions, but have attached a section 8 order to it, or 3) denied the application.  \nWhile the second option may effectively seem the same as the actual decision, there \nare subtle but important differences.  Granting a contingent order inherently changes \nthe boundaries of the award, and as Black J said in his conclusion, \u2018reflect[s] the \nfundamental nature of these restrictions on Mr B\u2019s parental responsibility\u2019 (para. 91).  \nIf Mr B fails to meet the conditions, the whole question of whether or not he should \nhave parental responsibility would likely have to be reconsidered by the court.  \nSimilarly, should circumstances change with respect to D\u2019s education and medical \ntreatment, an entirely new order not premised on the original contingencies would  \nhave to be applied for.  Alternatively, regulating the award with a section 8 order \nindicates that as a father with a \u2018positive relationship\u2019 with his biological child, Mr B \nis entitled to the \u2018rights\u2019 emerging from parental responsibility, but that particular \ncircumstances\u2014in this case, his past behaviour and his relationship with D\u2019s primary \ncarers\u2014have resulted in the court ordered restrictions being necessary to ensure D\u2019s \nbest interests.  If circumstances were to change, the restrictions could then be \namended or removed.  Such a decision may have better reflected the legal precedents \nrelating to parental responsibility orders and have encouraged the case to be more \nabout D\u2019s welfare than the needs of the adults involved and family form.  A \nconsideration of why granting the order without any regulation, or denying the order, \nmay not have been viable alternatives, will elaborate such a claim. \n \nDismissing the Application and Legal Terminology \n 14 \nThere are few cases whereby a parental responsibility order has been refused, \nindicative of the reality that few men without some sort of \u2018positive relationship\u2019 with \ntheir child apply for one (Sheldon, 2001, p.103).  Although Mr B has been referred to \noccasionally as a \u2018(known) sperm donor\u2019 (para. 53), this hardly adequately reflects the \nsituation now.  Under current precedents then\u2014as referred to by the CAFCASS \nofficer\u2014we can appreciate why Black J did not simply dismiss the application when \nRe D reached the courts again in 2006.  Furthermore, we should perhaps not \nunderestimate the reality that unlike most resident parents, parental responsibility is \noften sought by a non-resident parent not to enable that adult to undertake the day-to-\nday care of the child, but to give them certain entitlements that legal parentage does \nnot currently convey.  While Re D focussed particularly on schooling and medical \ncare in this context, another pertinent entitlement referred to, was the fact that if Mr B \ndid not have parental responsibility, his consent to an adoption application would not \nhave to be obtained (para. 94).  While the Adoption and Children Act 2002 allows a \nsame-sex partner to adopt a partner\u2019s biological child without severing the partner\u2019s \nparentage (section 51(2)), the parentage of the child\u2019s other biological parent (if \nknown) will be disengaged.  Therefore, if Ms C applied to adopt D in the future, and \nMr B did not have parental responsibility, he would legally not have to be notified, \nnor his consent obtained.  Black J felt that this would have been inappropriate given \nthe level of commitment that Mr B had shown to D (para. 94), the lack of formal \nagreement before D was born compounding the need for a sensitive consideration of \nthese issues.   \n The difficulties surrounding the adoption issue similarly reflect the inadequacy \nof legal concepts and terminology in the context of parenthood and increasingly \ndisparate families.  These shortcomings were acknowledged in Re D by both Black J \n 15 \nand Dr. Sturge (see paras. 22, 33-34, 57).  However, the end decision in the case fails \nto substantially reflect these concerns and instead indicates that an award of parental \nresponsibility should be tailored to meet \u2018novel\u2019 parenting situations, whether or not \nthis award offends the originally intended purpose of parental responsibility.  While \nreforms such as section 51(2) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and proposed \namendments to the parentage provisions in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology \nAct 1990 (see Department of Health, 2006, para. 2.69) are clearly important and \nwelcome, they merely scratch the surface of a much-needed review of legal categories \nrelated to parenthood and families.  For instance, legal parentage could be \nreconsidered in a much more substantial way than permitting two people of the same \nsex to hold the status.  Recently, Ontario\u2019s Court of Appeal allowed a child to have \nthree legally recognised parents in the context of a similar situation to Re D (A.A. v \nB.B., 2007 ONCA 2).  A reform such as this would have removed the precarious need \nfor Ms C to have to adopt D in the first place, and have kept this aspect of parental \nrecognition a parentage as opposed to a parental responsibility issue.  Similarly, \nrethinking both what parentage is grounded on and what it is to mean in practical \nterms could be a useful endeavour, encouraging the legal terminology in this area to \nbetter reflect empirical reality and stop cases like Re D becoming so \u2018zero-sum\u2019. \n \nAwarding a Non-Contingent Award and the Sexual Family \nWhat then of Black J\u2019s decision not to award a non-contingent parental responsibility \norder?  Ultimately, this reflects the extent to which the concept of the sexual family \norders legal considerations of familial relations.  Black J distinguished Re D from the \nprevious case-law, which dealt mainly with granting parental responsibility  in the \ncontext of the child being raised solely by its mother, as opposed to a pre-formed \n 16 \nsexual family.  Granting parental responsibility to Mr B then would effectively \nacknowledge the existence of the \u2018anomalous\u2019 parent-number-three.  While not \nwishing to deride the fears Ms A and Ms C had regarding the difficulties they will \nface in gaining acceptance of their family unit, the discussion in the case does stand \ntestament to the assumption that a child should have two parents.  In other words, that \nBlack J felt the need to so distinguish the case, as opposed to presenting his concerns \nin the context of D\u2019s best interests because of, say the tense relationships between the \nparties, reveals the underlying significance of the sexual family concept; that numbers \nrather than substantive parenting is what is seen to promote the best interests of the \nchild.  Would Black J have been as reserved about awarding the parental \nresponsibility order in 2006 had it been a single woman (heterosexual or lesbian) who \nhad come to this arrangement with Mr B?  If Mr B had behaved in the same fashion \nwith a single mother, would this have been discussed in the context of threatening the \nsecurity of the child\u2019s \u2018primary family unit\u2019, or would a non-fettered parental \nresponsibility order have been assumed to be in the child\u2019s best interests, under the \nmantra of \u2018two-is-better-than-one\u2019?  Although these questions are clearly speculative, \nit is useful to think through them and to reflect on the fact that the \u2018security\u2019 of a \nsimilarly derided family unit\u2014that of the single parent\u2014would likely have received \ntrifling attention.  The worrisome numbers of contact orders being granted to a violent \nex-partner of a resident parent perhaps indicative of this assertion (see Eriksson and \nHester, 2001; Smart and Neale, 1999, chapter 8).   \n \nThe Significance of Genetic Fatherhood \nA final issue of significance is how Re D relates to dominant socio-legal notions of \nfatherhood.  Firstly, it is interesting that Mr B should be posited as a potential threat to \n 17 \nfamilial security.  This compares greatly to the socio-legal rhetoric that from the mid-\n1980s has traditionally constructed fathers as cementing family security. Various \npieces of legislation have been enacted to reflect this idea by encouraging the \ndesignation of a \u2018father\u2019 to a family unit (see Child Support Act 1991; Human \nFertilisation and Embryology Act sections 13(5) and 28; Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003).  Evidence of this supposition can still be \nseen in recent case law, such as Judge Hedley\u2019s ruling in Re R (Contact: Human \nFertilisation and Embryology Act) [2001] 1 FLR 247 where he awarded parentage to \na man (B) who had no biological connection to the child, and no relationship with the \nchild\u2019s mother when she undertook the course of fertility treatment that resulted in the \nchild\u2019s conception (overturned in Re R (A Child) [2003] EWCA Civ 182 and In Re D \n(A Child Appearing by Her Guardian Ad Litem) (Respondent) [2005] UKHL 33).  \nThe mother in this case, Ms D, had not told the fertility clinic doctor about the end of \nher relationship with B, and as Sheldon writes,  \n \nSpeculatively, it would appear that the granting of rights to Mr B might thus be seen \nas a way of imposing appropriate and responsible (male) control over her, the need \nfor such control being further mandated by her mental and emotional fragility. \n \n(Sheldon, 2005, p.357) \n \nInterestingly, Hedge J was not convinced of the permanency of Ms D\u2019s relationship \nwith her new partner, Mr S.  In other words, he was viewing Ms D and her child as \nbeing a single-parent family unit, as opposed to a sexual family unit.  Therefore, in \ndrawing attention to this possible shift in legal rhetoric on fatherhood, we must not \nloose sight of the fact that it may well be of a very limited nature, materialising only \nwhen the child is already located within a stable sexual family. \n 18 \n Secondly, the shift may also be limited in that it is coloured by a growing \nemphasis on biological (genetic) fatherhood.  While it should ideally be the private \nprerogative of individuals to order their own familial affairs, it is interesting that Ms A \nand Ms C wanted the \u2018father figure\u2019 in D\u2019s life to be biologically related, particularly \nif they wanted the man to have more of an uncle-like as opposed to parental \nrelationship.  It may well have been that (non) access to formally regulated donor \ninsemination under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, whereby \nsperm donors waive their parentage (section 28(6)), was the deciding practical factor \n(see Millns, 1995).  However, that D\u2019s conception came about through sexual \nintercourse as opposed to self-insemination indicates that on some level, the \nbiological connection was important for Ms A and Ms C, perhaps representing a level \nof permanency that a social \u2018father figure\u2019 might not?  Given the legal \nacknowledgment of biological fatherhood, such a belief could certainly be \nunderstood.  It also reflects the many interconnected, and sometimes contradictory \nnotions that we have of parenthood, in the context of whether it is the biological, legal \nor social ties that matter.  Furthermore, that Black J did not simply accept the expert \nevidence of Dr Sturge\u2014in that the award would unduly put at risk the security of D\u2019s \nprimary (sexual) family unit\u2014indicates a similar legal attachment to biological \nfatherhood and the belief that it should be afforded legal recognition.  While \nunderstanding Black J\u2019s concerns about the adoption issue and precedent, his award \nsimultaneously represents a prioritising of Mr B\u2019s biological parentage over that of \nMs C potential legal parentage.  Again, as aforementioned, Black J was acting in the \ncontext of inadequate legal terminology.  However, his end decision and references to \nD\u2019s \u2018mother and her mother\u2019s [partner]\u2019 (para. 9 and 10), as opposed to D\u2019s \u2018mothers\u2019, \n 19 \ndoes reveal an underlying bias towards biological parenthood and a somewhat \nreluctance to see a social parent as a \u2018real\u2019 parent. \n \nJulie McCandless \nKeele University \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank Nicolette Priaulx for her helpful comments on an earlier draft of \nthis case comment. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBainham, A.
