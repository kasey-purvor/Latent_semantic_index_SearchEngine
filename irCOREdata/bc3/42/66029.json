The identification of a redox-inactive chaperone partnership defines a new system of\ntestis-specific protein folding with implications for male fertility.\nINTRODUCTION\nProtein disulfide isomerase (PDI) catalyzes the formation,\nisomerization and reduction of disulfide bonds in the endo-\nplasmic reticulum (ER). More than 17 mammalian PDI ho-\nmologues have been identified all characterized by the pres-\nence of one or more thioredoxin folds (Ellgaard and\nRuddock, 2005). PDI itself contains four of these thioredoxin\ndomains: two with the thioredoxin redox active site CXXC\n(designated a-type domains) and two domains lacking the\nactive site (designated b-type domains). The b-type domains\nlack redox activity, but have either a structural function or\nare involved in substrate recognition and binding (Klappa et\nal., 1998a). In PDI, these domains have an a-b-b\u0001-a\u0001 organi-\nzation. PDIp, ERp57, and PDILT share the same domain\nstructure with PDI, but various other configurations of thi-\noredoxin domains exist in other PDI family members, with\nmost PDIs containing at least one a-type domain with an\nintact active site motif (Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005).\nPDI homologues are not functionally equivalent, as\nshown by differences in their ability to complement a yeast\nstrain deficient for PDI (Gunther et al., 1993; Kramer et al.,\n2001). Furthermore, the different PDI family members inter-\nact with discrete sets of substrates. PDI catalyzes in vitro\nredox reactions in a wide variety of substrates, including\nbovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), insulin, and ribo-\nnuclease (Weissman and Kim, 1993; Zheng and Gilbert,\n2001). PDI also displays chaperone activity toward nondis-\nulfide bond\u2013containing substrates (Cai et al., 1994) and\nforms the noncatalytic subunit in prolyl 4-hydroxylase\n(Koivu et al., 1987) and microsomal triglyceride transfer\ncomplex (Wetterau et al., 1990). ERp57 interacts with a spe-\ncific set of glycosylated proteins that are recruited via its\ninteraction with the lectins calnexin\/calreticulin (Oliver et\nal., 1997; Jessop et al., 2007) and is a component of the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class I loading complex\n(Lindquist et al., 1998; Dick et al., 2002). ERp72 has been\nfound in association with a number of immature or unfolded\nproteins, including MHC class II and thyroglobulin (Schaiff\net al., 1992; Kuznetsov et al., 1994) and has been implicated in\nER retention of misfolded proteins (Forster et al., 2006). The\npancreas-specific PDIp binds unfolded proteins and specif-\nically recognizes tryptophan and tyrosine residues in sub-\nstrates (Klappa et al., 1998b; Ruddock et al., 2000). Therefore,\nmultiple PDI homologues may be required for substrate-\nspecific folding.\nTwo PDI-like proteins, ERp44 and PDILT, have ER lume-\nnal a-type domains, but lack the canonical active site motif,\nwhereas ERp27 and ERp28 are devoid of a-type domains\n(Ferrari et al., 1998; Anelli et al., 2002; van Lith et al., 2005;\nAlanen et al., 2006). Most PDI family members are ubiqui-\ntously expressed, although a few PDI family members such\nas endoPDI, PDIp, and PDILT have a restricted tissue dis-\ntribution. PDIp expression is mostly limited to the pancreas\n(Desilva et al., 1996; Dias-Gunasekara et al., 2005). Although\nPDIp may have overlapping substrate specificities with\nPDI, it could serve as a specific folding catalyst for a\nThis article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press\n(http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1091\/mbc.E07\u201302\u20130147)\non May 16, 2007.\nAddress correspondence to: Adam Benham (adam.benham@durham.\nac.uk).\nAbbreviations used: BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; en-\ndoH, endoglycosidase H; IAA, iodo-acetic acid; MHC, major histo-\ncompatibility complex; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PDILT,\nprotein disulfide isomerase-like protein of the testis.\n\u00a9 2007 by The American Society for Cell Biology 2795\nsubset of pancreatic secretory proteins (Ruddock et al.,\n2000). EndoPDI\/ERp46, with three CxxC thioredoxin mo-\ntifs, is highly expressed in endothelial cells where it has a\nprotective role during hypoxia (Sullivan et al., 2003). The\nthird PDI family member with restricted tissue expression is\nPDILT.\nWe have recently identified PDILT as a PDI homologue\nthat is specifically expressed in testis (van Lith et al., 2005).\nThe testis has two distinct compartments: the seminiferous\ntubules, which contain differentiating germ cells supported\nby somatic Sertoli cells, and an interstitium containing Ley-\ndig cells, peritubular cells, and blood vessels. Germ cell\nmaturation (spermatogenesis) is a complex process; during\nthe first phase, diploid spermatogonia undergo rounds of\nmitotic replication before entering a second, lengthy, meiotic\nprophase that culminates in two rounds of cell division to\nyield haploid spermatids. During the third phase, known as\nspermiogenesis, the spermatids undergo extensive remodel-\ning characterized by loss of somatic histones, DNA compac-\ntion, cessation of DNA transcription, and development of a\nflagellum (Hess, 1990). Within the seminiferous epithelium\nthe germ cells at different phases of maturation are arranged\nin constant associations known as \u201cstages\u201d with the diploid\nspermatogonia at the periphery of the tubules and the most\nmature, haploid, elongate spermatids proximal to the lumen\n(Hess, 1990; Russell et al., 1990).\nIn the present study, we set out to determine PDILT\nexpression and function in the testis. Although calnexin\ninteracts with ERp57 to support disulfide bond formation in\nnewly synthesized glycoproteins in somatic cells (Oliver et\nal., 1997), we identify PDILT as a partner for the testis-\nspecific calnexin homologue calmegin in postmeiotic male\ngerm cells. Our data suggest that PDILT-calmegin com-\nplexes are required as a specialized chaperone system for\nspermatogenesis-specific proteins during the final stages of\ngerm cell maturation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell Lines, Tissues, and Antibodies\nHuman cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in minimal Eagle\u2019s\nmedium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 2 mM glutamax, 100 U\/ml penicillin, and 100 \u0001g\/ml\nstreptomycin (Invitrogen).\nTissues for immunoprecipitation\/Western blot analysis and immunohisto-\nchemistry were obtained from rats (SD) and mice (C57\/B6 or CD1). Sections\nof testes from human, stump-tailed macaque, and common marmoset were\nfrom blocks of fixed tissue held in an archive at the Human Reproductive\nSciences Unit Edinburgh.\nThe anti-HA (HA-7; Sigma), anti-myc (9B11; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA),\nanti-ERp72 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and anti-BiP (H-129; Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were commercially available. The PDILT\nantiserum was raised against purified recombinant His-tagged PDILT; this anti-\nserum was used in all experiments, except where noted. The anti-peptide PDILT\nantiserum was raised against the PDILT peptide RQKLINDSTNKQELN coupled\nto hemocyanin and was a kind gift from Dr. L. Ellgaard (University of Copen-\nhagen, Denmark). The polyclonal antiserum against PDI has been described\n(Benham et al., 2000), and the mAb against PDI was obtained from Affinity\nBioReagents (Golden, CO). The anti-ERp57 antiserum was a kind gift from Prof.\nN. Bulleid (University of Manchester, England). The calmegin antiserum was a\nkind gift from Prof. Y. Nishimune (The Research Institute of Microbial Diseases,\nOsaka, Japan). The calnexin antiserum was a kind gift from Prof. I. Braakman\n(University of Utrecht, The Netherlands).\nConstructs\nConstruction of human PDILT with a C-terminal myc-tag has been de-\nscribed previously (van Lith et al., 2005). The PDILT cysteine-to-alanine\nmutants were generated from this construct using Quik Change Site-\nDirected Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers GTCA-\nGAGCCCATCAGCGCCAAAGGAGTGGTTGAATC\/GATTCAACCACTC-\nCTTTGGCGCTGATGGGCTCTGAC (PDILT C135A) and GCACCCTG-\nGTCTAAAAAGGCCAAGATGCTGTTCCCAC\/GTGGGAACAGCATCTT-\nGGCCTTTTTAGACCAGGGTGC (PDILT C420A). For biophysical analysis,\nmature PDILT (S21-L584) was cloned into pLWRP51, a modified pET23b vector\n(Novagen, Madison, WI), which encodes an N-terminal His tag (MHHHHHHM)\nbefore the first amino acid of the protein sequence, using the primers TTTTTTT-\nTCATATGTCACCAGAGGTTAACGCCGGTG and TTTTTTTTGGATCCTTAT\nTAAAGTTCTTCCTTGACTTTTGGTTTCTTCTTTTGC. The PDILT-HA construct\nwas a kind gift from Dr. L. Ellgaard. All plasmids generated were verified by\nsequencing.\nTransfections\nTransfections with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were done according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Subconfluent cells in 6-cm dishes were\nwashed with Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution and Optimem and transfected\nwith 1 \u0001g of DNA for 6 h in the presence of Optimem serum-free medium.\nAfter 6 h the cells were washed and returned to normal growth medium. The\ncells were analyzed 24 h after transfection.\nRNA Isolation and RT-PCR\nTotal RNA from rat tissues was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma) accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA concentration was deter-\nmined by spectrophotometry to ensure equal total RNA input. RT-PCR was\nperformed with the AccessQuick kit (Promega, Madison, WI) using 50 ng\nRNA on a Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Sense and\nantisense primers were designed on different exons to exclude amplification\nof contaminating genomic DNA: PDILT (set 1), CATCGTTGGCTTCTTCCAG\nand TATTTTGGAATCTCTTCACTGG; PDILT (set 2), CCATGTGCTCAAG-\nCAGGAAC and CACTCAGAAACTGATGTCAGGAC; calmegin, CACCT-\nCAACCTATAGGAGAAG and CTTCATCTCATCCTCTGATCC; PDI, AAG-\nGAATATACAGCTGGCAG and CCTTCTTCAGGCCAAAGAAC; and actin,\nCCACACCTTCTACAATGAGC and ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC.\nPCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.\nImmunoprecipitations and Western Blotting\nCells and tissues were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM\nNaCl, and 5 mM EDTA, supplemented with 20 mM iodo-acetic acid (IAA)\nand protease inhibitors. Postnuclear lysates were incubated with protein A\nSepharose beads (Sigma) and antisera for 1\u20132 h at 4\u00b0C. After extensive\nwashing of the beads, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in\nsample buffer and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to\npolyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 150 mA for\n2 h. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline Tween (TBST) with\n8% milk, followed by incubation with primary antibody at the following\nconcentrations: 1:2000 anti-myc and anti-HA, 1:10,000 anti-PDILT, and 1:1000\nanti-PDI and anti-calmegin. After washing three times with TBST, the mem-\nbranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (DAKO, High Wycombe,\nBucks., United Kingdom), washed, and visualized by electrochemilumines-\ncence (ECL; Amersham\/GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom)\nand exposure to film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein markers were\nfrom Bio-Rad.\nEndoglycosidase H Treatment\nSamples were treated with endoglycosidase H (endoH) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, lysates\ncleared by centrifugation were \u00022-mercaptoethanol\u2013reduced and SDS-dena-\ntured followed by incubation without or with endoH in 50 mM sodium citrate\n(pH 5.5) at 37\u00b0C for 16 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\nImmunohistochemistry\nTesticular tissues were fixed in Bouins solution, processed into paraffin wax\naccording to standard procedures and cut in 4-\u0001m-thick sections onto poly-\nlysine slides (VWR Scientific Products, West Chester, PA). Wax was removed\nwith Histoclear (Agar Scientific, Stansted, United Kingdom), and the tissue\nwas rehydrated in sequential washing steps from 100 to 70% ethanol. Endog-\nenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide in meth-\nanol. Antigen retrieval was done by incubating the slides in 10 mM sodium\ncitrate at 90\u00b0C for 30 min. After a blocking step in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS) with 5% goat serum and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the sections\nwere incubated with primary antibodies in PBS with 0.2% BSA. Primary\nantibodies were detected with the ABC kit (DAKO) followed by developing\nwith 3,3\u0001-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma). Sections were counterstained with\nhematoxylin. Slides were mounted with 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX;\nAgar Scientific) and analyzed with an inverted microscope (Axiovert 10,\nZeiss, Thornwood, NY).\nPurification of Human Recombinant PDILT\nHis-tagged PDILT was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)\npLysS in LB medium at 37\u00b0C by inducing with 1 mM isopropyl \u0002-d-thiogal-\nactoside at an OD600 of 0.3 for 4 h. After pelleting at 8000 rpm for 10 min, the\npellet was resuspended in one-tenth volume of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH\n7.3) with 10 \u0001g\/ml DNase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were lysed by\nM. van Lith et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2796\nfreeze-thawing twice, and the insoluble material was collected by centrifuga-\ntion (9000 rpm for 20 min). The pellet was washed twice with 20 ml of 50 mM\nTris, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 8.0), twice with distilled water, and\ncentrifuged at 9000 rpm for 20 min between each wash. PDILT was recovered\nfrom the washed pellet by solubilizing in 20 ml of 5 M guanidine hydrochlo-\nride\/50 mM Tris (pH 8.75), with the insoluble material removed by centrif-\nugation at 9000 rpm for 20 min. The soluble fraction was incubated in 10 mM\ndithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 30 min. Excess DTT was re-\nmoved by gel filtration using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) which had\nbeen pre-equilibrated in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2 M sodium phos-\nphate (pH 7.0). Solubilized His-PDILT was loaded onto a His-Trap column\n(GE Healthcare) and refolded on-column by a linear buffer exchange from 3\nM guanidine\/0.2 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) to 0.2 M sodium phosphate\n(pH 7.0) over 4 h. PDILT was eluted from the column with 50 mM EDTA, 20\nmM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0).\nPurified Rat PDI was a gift from N. Bulleid.\nBiophysical Analysis\nFar UV circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco J810 Spectropo-\nlarimeter (Easton, MD). Data were collected using 0.1 mg\/ml PDILT at 25\u00b0C\nas an average of eight scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm,\nmeasured at a scan speed of 20 nm\/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and\na time constant of 0.5 s. The maximum HT voltage was below 600 V.\nFluorescence spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50\nspectrophotometer (Boston, MA) using a 1-ml cuvette. Data were collected at\n25\u00b0C as an average of four scans, excitation at 280 nm, emission at 300\u2013400\nnm, slit widths of 5 nm, and a scan speed of 200 nm\/min. Protein stocks were\ndiluted \u000220-fold to a final concentration of 2 \u0001M into 0.2 M phosphate buffer,\npH 7.0, containing 0\u20136 M guanidine hydrochloride and equilibrated for 5 min\nat 25\u00b0C before fluorescence spectra were recorded. All spectra were corrected\nfor the blank spectra with no protein added. The fluorescence parameter\nexamined to observe the effects of guanidine hydrochloride on protein struc-\nture was the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity 2 nm either side of the\n\u0003max for native protein to the average fluorescence intensity over the range\n320\u2013400 nm. This parameter was chosen because it is independent of con-\ncentration and less dependent on the direct effects of guanidine hydrochloride\non tryptophan fluorescence.\nOxido-reductase Assays\nFor the insulin-reduction assay, human insulin (Sigma) at a final concentra-\ntion of 0.17 mM was incubated with 1 \u0001M PDILT or PDI in the presence of 5\nmM DTT. Precipitation of the insulin B chain was monitored by measuring\nOD600 at 5-min intervals after addition of insulin.\nTo monitor protein oxidation and isomerization, 70 \u0001M of recombinant\nbovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5, or 0.1\nM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, both containing 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM reduced\nglutathione (GSH), and 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione was incubated with and\nwithout 10 \u0001M of PDILT. Disulfide bond formation of BPTI was monitored by\ntrapping thiol-disulfide exchange by treating with 1.1 M iodoacetamide,\ndesalting the sample, and analyzing it by electrospray mass spectrometry\n(Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom).\nThe protein oxidation assay using a fluorescent decapeptide with 3.2 \u0001M\npeptide substrate and 0.2 \u0001M PDILT has been described (Ruddock et al.,\n1996). Deglutathionylation activity was monitored as described previously\n(Peltoniemi et al., 2006), using 0.2 \u0001M PDILT in the presence of 1 mM GSH\nand 5 \u0001M substrate peptide. Glutathionylation activity was determined as\ndescribed previously (Peltoniemi et al., 2006), using 0.2 \u0001M PDILT and 5.4 \u0001M\nsubstrate peptide.\nPeptide-binding Assay\nCell extracts from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS were prepared by repeated freeze-\nthawing. Bolton-Hunter 125I-labeling of \u0003-somatostatin (AGSKNFFWKTFSS)\nwas performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia\nBiotech, Piscataway, NJ). Cross-linking was performed using the homobifunc-\ntional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (Sigma) as described\n(Klappa et al., 1998a). As a positive control an E. coli lysate expressing ERp27\n(Alanen et al., 2006) was used. This lysate was prepared as detailed for the\npurification of PDILT, except that because ERp27 is solubly expressed, the\nsoluble postlysis material was used.\nRESULTS\nBiophysical Characterization of PDILT\nPDILT shares almost 50% sequence similarity with PDI, with\nthe most notable differences being the altered active site\nmotifs in PDILT (SXXS and SXXC) and a free cysteine at\nposition 135 in the first catalytic domain. C135 is conserved\nin PDILT between species, but is not found in other PDI\nfamily members. As PDI has both redox and chaperone-like\nproperties, we wanted to see whether these functions were\nretained in PDILT. Therefore, we purified and refolded a\nHis-tagged version of PDILT from a bacterial lysate to near-\npurity as shown on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel\n(Figure 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified pro-\ntein gave the correct mass (65612.5 Da) for a single sodium\nadduct of the protein. The far-UV circular dichroism spec-\ntrum suggested that PDILT was structured and contained a\nsignificant amount of \u0004-helix and \u0002-sheet (Figure 1B). Ma-\nture PDILT contains three tryptophans, and the fluorescence\nspectra of PDILT under nondenaturing conditions gave a\n\u0003max of 334 nm (Figure 1C), indicative of a tryptophan\nresidue being in a hydrophobic environment. On addition of\n6 M guanidinium chloride the fluorescence spectra of PDILT\nhad a \u0003max of 354 nm, indicative of a denatured protein.\nFluorescence-based denaturation curves for PDILT showed\na multiple-phase transition from the native to the denatured\nstate (Figure 1D), similar to that observed for PDI (Morjana\net al., 1993). The midpoint of the fluorescence change be-\ntween 0 and 6 M guanidinium chloride was around 3.5 M,\nhigher than that of any domain of PDI, indicating that the\npurified PDILT was structured.\nHuman PDILT contains two cysteine residues: one in the\ncatalytic site of the second catalytic domain (C420) and one\naway from the catalytic site in the first catalytic domain, but\nat a position suitable for PDI-substrate interactions (C135).\nUnder nondenaturing conditions PDILT has a free sulfhy-\ndryl content of 2.1, as determined by the Ellman\u2019s reagent\nassay (data not shown), implying that both cysteines are\nsolvent accessible. In addition, when lysates from HeLa cells\ntransfected with PDILT were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-\nPAGE, PDILT was engaged in disulfide-linked complexes\n(Figure 1E, lane 1). Replacement of either cysteine with\nalanine resulted in the loss of some, but not all complexes,\nshowing that each cysteine mediates distinct disulfide-\nlinked complexes (Figure 1E, lanes 2 and 3). As expected,\nmutation of both cysteines abolished all disulfide-linked\nPDILT complexes (Figure 1E, lane 4). Thus, the PDILT cys-\nteines are solvent exposed, both in vitro and in vivo.\nBecause both cysteines of PDILT are solvent exposed, we\nnext examined if PDILT had oxido-reductase activity. PDI\ncatalyzes a wide range of thiol-disulfide exchange reactions,\nincluding reduction of disulfides, oxidation of dithiols to a\ndisulfide, and reductive removal of a glutathione moiety\nfrom a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide (Ruddock et al.,\n1996; Peltoniemi et al., 2006). First, we used an insulin re-\nduction assay (Holmgren, 1979) to establish whether PDILT\nhad reductase activity. When PDI was incubated with insu-\nlin in the presence of DTT, the insulin B chain rapidly\nprecipitated as expected (Figure 1F, PDI). In contrast, PDILT\ndid not display any reductase activity over the nonenzy-\nmatic reduction of insulin alone (Figure 1F, compare PDILT\nvs. insulin), suggesting that PDILT is not a conventional\ndisulfide oxidoreductase. Similarly, PDILT does not show\nany peptide oxidation activity toward a decapeptide sub-\nstrate (Ruddock et al., 1996), nor does it show any degluta-\nthionylation activity toward a glutathionylated octapeptide\n(Peltoniemi et al., 2006) nor glutathionylation activity toward\na nonglutathionylated version of the same octapeptide (data\nnot shown).\nIn contrast to these results, PDILT-substrate interactions\nwere observed in a BPTI refolding assay. BPTI has been\nwidely used to study PDI-catalyzed protein refolding\n(Weissman and Kim, 1993). Reduced BPTI is soluble, as is\npurified PDILT, but when they were combined, a precipitate\nformed rapidly. Analysis of the precipitate by SDS-PAGE\nshowed that it contained both proteins, indicating a PDILT-\nMale Germ Cell Function of PDILT\nVol. 18, August 2007 2797\nBPTI interaction (data not shown). Because PDI is able to\ninteract with peptides and proteins that do not contain cys-\nteines, we next examined whether PDILT engages in similar\ninteractions by using a \u0003-somatostatin cross-linking assay.\nThe 14-amino acid peptide \u0003-somatostatin has previously\nbeen used to examine peptide\/nonnative protein-binding\nsites in other PDI family members, including PDI (Klappa et\nal., 1998a), PDIp (Klappa et al., 1998b), and ERp27 (Alanen et\nal., 2006). When radiolabeled \u0003-somatostatin is added to\nsuitable lysates, specific cross-linking with these PDI family\nmembers can be observed by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE\ngels. When PDILT was used in the \u0003-somatostatin assay, a\nweak band was observed at the expected position of PDILT\nin an E. coli lysate that had 2 \u0001g of purified PDILT added to\nit (Figure 1G, lane 1). These bacteria expressed human\nERp27 as an internal control. Because the PDILT band was\nnot visible in the control samples (Figure 1G, lane 2), this\nshows that PDILT interacts with \u0003-somatostatin indepen-\ndently of substrate cysteines.\nExpression of PDILT Is Restricted to a Subset of Germ\nCells\nTo gain further insight into the function of PDILT in vivo,\nwe raised a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant puri-\nfied human PDILT. The antiserum specifically recognized\nboth transfected PDILT in HeLa cells (Figure 2A) and en-\ndogenous PDILT in mouse testis (Figure 2B). The antiserum\ndid not detect PDILT in nontesticular tissues (Figure 2B, top\npanel), whereas PDI and calnexin were detected in all tissues\nexamined (Figure 2B, bottom panel), corroborating the tes-\ntis-specific expression of PDILT reported previously (van\nLith et al., 2005).\nHaving demonstrated the specificity of the PDILT anti-\nserum, we used immunohistochemistry on rat testis sections\ncounterstained with hematoxylin to determine the cellular\nFigure 1.

The preimmune serum showed\nminor staining in the interstitial areas of rat testis due to\nresidual trapped serum (Figure 3A, rat-NRS) and was indis-\ntinguishable from secondary antibody alone (data not\nshown). In contrast, the anti-PDILT serum intensely stained\npopulations of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules (Figure\n3A, rat-\u0004PDILT). The immunostaining pattern was essen-\ntially the same for mouse testis (Figure 3A, mouse-\u0004PDILT)\nand when using the antiserum raised against a PDILT pep-\ntide [Figure 3A, mouse-\u0004PDILT (pep)]. PDILT expression\nwas also restricted to germ cells in testis from human, ma-\ncaque, and marmoset (Figure 3B). Although in rat, mouse,\nand macaque, cross-sections of individual tubules are char-\nacterized as containing a single grouping (spermatogenic\nstage) of germ cells (Hess, 1990), the organization of sper-\nmatogenesis in human and the common marmoset is more\ncomplex, and tubule cross-sections contain germ cell com-\nplements typical of a mixture of stages (Schulze et al., 1986;\nMillar et al., 2000). The restricted expression pattern of\nPDILT to a subset of germ cells was in stark contrast with the\nexpression patterns of other PDI family members PDI,\nERp57, and ERp72 or the ER chaperone BiP. Although ex-\npression levels varied between the different cell types within\nthe seminiferous tubules, expression of these other PDI fam-\nily members was ubiquitous throughout the seminiferous\nepithelium (Figure 3C). Thus, PDILT is expressed in testis of\nmultiple mammalian species and in contrast to other PDI\nfamily members, its expression is restricted to a subset of\ntesticular germ cells.\nPDILT Is Expressed in Postmeiotic Germ Cells\nCloser examination of adult rat testis sections showed that\nPDILT was present in the most mature germ cells, located\naround the seminiferous tubule lumen (Figure 4A). When\nevaluated using the standard spermatogenic staging scheme\n(Figure 4B), it was apparent that immunopositive staining\nwas first detectable in haploid round spermatids found at\nstage VII. In all species examined, the onset of PDILT ex-\npression commenced upon completion of meiotic prophase.\nThereafter, in the rat PDILT was present in the cell body of\nall subsequent round and elongating spermatids (Figure 4A,\nstages IX, XI, and XIV). PDILT was not detected in sperma-\ntozoa in the epididymis or in the ejaculate (data not shown;\nEllerman et al., 2006), consistent with the finding that PDILT\nwas not found in the nuclei of the spermatozoa but could be\ndetected in apical and basal residual bodies (Figure 4A,\nstage XI) that are left behind when spermatozoa are released\n(Clermont et al., 1987). The germ cells to which PDILT was\nlocalized are summarized on a diagram that shows the germ\ncells associations found in the different stages of spermato-\ngenesis in the rat (Figure 4B).\nPDILT Expression Is under Developmental Control\nAs PDILT was first seen at the round spermatid stage, we\nasked whether the onset of PDILT expression coincides with\nthe appearance of differentiating germ cells during the first\nwave of spermatogenesis in development. Total RNA, iso-\nlated from rat testes at different ages, was used for RT-PCR\nto determine the expression of PDILT with age. A cDNA\ncontaining the coding region of PDILT gave a product of\nexpected size (Figure 5A, PDILT 1). No product was ob-\nserved when using RNA derived from testes of 2- and\n15-d-old rats, demonstrating that PDILT was not expressed\nin somatic cells that make up the bulk of the testes at these\nages. PDILT mRNA was detected in testis from day 30 and\nreached adult levels from day 45 onward. RNA from liver of\na 58-d-old rat served as negative control (Figure 5A, PDILT\nFigure 3. Expression of PDILT is germ cell specific. (A) Sections\nfrom rat testis counterstained with hematoxylin (blue) were immu-\nnostained with normal rabbit serum (NRS) or an anti-PDILT serum\nraised against recombinant PDILT at a dilution of 1:8000 (top pan-\nels).

(B) Testis\nsections from human, macaque, and marmoset were immuno-\nstained for PDILT. Although a single population of PDILT-positive\ngerm cells occupied the full circumference of the tubule in macaque,\nthe staining on human and marmoset was more heterogenous con-\nsistent with the existence of tubules containing more than one stage\nof spermatogenesis in a single cross section.

Similar results were obtained when using a second\nprimer set that spanned the entire PDILT coding sequence\n(Figure 5A, PDILT 2), confirming that expression of PDILT\nmRNA starts between days 16 and 30. Note the absence of\nproduct from the cDNA with this second primer set, as these\nprimers were designed outside the coding region contained\nin the cDNA. There were no additional products in any of\nthe RT-PCRs on rat testes or liver with these primers, show-\ning that there are no alternative PDILT splicing products.\nThe developmentally regulated expression of PDILT con-\ntrasts with the expression of PDI, as PDI mRNA was present\nin testis and liver of rats throughout postnatal development\n(Figure 5A).\nWe also compared the expression of PDILT with that of\ncalmegin, a testis-specific homologue of the chaperone\ncalnexin. Calmegin is expressed in differentiating male\ngerm cells upon the appearance of pachytene spermato-\ncytes (Watanabe et al., 1994). RT-PCR showed that calme-\ngin is readily detected in testis from day 30 onward,\nconsistent with the presence of pachytene spermatocytes\nat this age (Figure 5A).\nTo determine the relationship between mRNA levels and\nprotein expression, testes and liver from rats were lysed and\nanalyzed by Western blotting. PDILT was completely absent\nin testes from 2- and 15-d-old rats. Consistent with the\nRT-PCR results, PDILT could be detected at day 30 (on very\nFigure 4.

Expression of PDILT commences during the first wave of\nspermatogenesis. (A) Total RNA extracted from testis of 2-, 15-, 30-,\n45-, and 58-d-old rats was used for RT-PCR using primer sets\nspecific for PDILT, calmegin, PDI, and actin. As a positive control,\ncDNA was used for PDILT, calmegin, and PDI. PDILT primer set 1\nwas designed on 2 internal exons, whereas PDILT primer set 2 was\ndesigned on the first and last exons, to exclude expression of alter-\nnatively spliced variants during development.

(Figure 5B). Calmegin reached adult\nlevels of expression by day 30, whereas PDI was expressed\nthroughout postnatal development (Figure 5B). To examine\nwhether the onset of PDILT expression corresponds with the\nfirst appearance of round spermatids in development, sec-\ntions of testes from rats of different ages were taken for\nimmunohistochemistry. PDILT was not detected in any so-\nmatic cells or germ cells in testis from 21- and 28-d-old rats.\nOn day 31, some of the seminiferous tubules contained\nPDILT-positive cells close to the tubule lumen. The propor-\ntion of seminiferous tubules containing PDILT-positive cells\ndramatically increased with age and by day 45, all of the\nseminiferous tubules were positive for PDILT (Figure 5C).\nTaken together, these data show that PDILT expression is\ndetected in testis from 30-d-old rats, consistent with the\nappearance of round spermatids during the first spermato-\ngenic wave at puberty. This strongly suggests that PDILT is\nunder developmental control and has a role in sperm differ-\nentiation.\nPDILT Is a Calmegin-interacting Protein\nTo understand PDILT behavior and function in the ER, we\ninvestigated whether any PDILT-protein interactions could\nbe detected, either in transfected cells or in testis tissue. As\nsome thioredoxin family members (Zhao et al., 2003) and\nredox enzymes (Dias-Gunasekara et al., 2005) form ho-\nmodimers, we first explored whether PDILT is able to self-\nassociate. Given that spermatids are difficult to isolate and\ntransfect, PDILT-myc and an HA-tagged version were ex-\npressed in HeLa cells, either alone or together. Cell lysates\nwere subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc or\nanti-HA antibodies and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE\nand Western blotting. Both PDILT-myc and PDILT-HA were\nexpressed as expected (Figure 6, lanes 1\u20133) and anti-myc and\nanti-HA antibodies pulled down PDILT-myc and PDILT-\nHA, respectively (Figure 6, lanes 5 and 7, top panel, and\nlanes 10 and 11, bottom panel) showing that immunopre-\ncipitations were successful. Anti-myc and anti-HA also co-\nimmunoprecipitated PDILT-HA and PDILT-myc, respec-\ntively, from double transfectants (Figure 6, lane 7, bottom\npanel, and lane 11, top panel), indicating that PDILT-myc\nand PDILT-HA interacted. Anti-myc and anti-HA did not\ndirectly immunoprecipitate PDILT-HA and PDILT-myc\n(Figure 6, lane 6, bottom panel, and lane 9, top panel),\ndemonstrating the specificity of the immunoprecipitations.\nIn addition, the interaction did not occur postlysis because\nno interaction could be detected when lysates of single\ntransfectants were mixed (data not shown). To determine\nwhether PDILT homodimers are disulfide-linked, we coex-\npressed PDILT-HA with PDILT-myc C135A\/C420A that\nlacks cysteines and is therefore unable to form mixed\ndisulfides. Anti-myc and anti-HA coimmunoprecipitated\nPDILT-HA and PDILT-myc C135\/C420 (Figure 6, lane 8,\nbottom panel, and lane 12, top panel), showing that the\ninteraction was not disulfide-linked. Thus, in addition to\nforming disulfide-linked complexes (Figure 1E), PDILT\ncan engage with itself in a noncovalent complex.\nWe next analyzed endogenous PDILT-protein interactions\nin testis tissue. The onset of expression and the staining\npattern of PDILT resembles that of calmegin (Figure 5).\nBecause both proteins are testis-specific homologues of ubiq-\nuitously expressed counterparts involved in protein folding,\nwe explored the possibility that PDILT and calmegin inter-\nacted. Testis and liver lysates were either directly analyzed\nor subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDILT or\nanti-calmegin, followed by Western blotting for PDILT and\ncalmegin. Both PDILT and calmegin are present in testis, but\nnot in liver (Figure 7A, lanes 1 and 2). The antisera against\nPDILT and calmegin immunoprecipitated PDILT (Figure\n7A, lane 4, top panel) and calmegin (Figure 7A, lane 6,\nbottom panel), respectively. Significantly, PDILT interacted\nwith calmegin (Figure 7A, lane 6, top panel) and vice versa,\ncalmegin coimmunoprecipitated, albeit more weakly, with\nPDILT (Figure 7A, lane 4, bottom panel). Anti-calmegin did\nnot directly immunoprecipitate PDILT from a HeLa PDILT-\nmyc lysate, showing the specificity of the immunoprecipita-\ntion (Figure 7B). The interaction between the testis proteins\nPDILT and calmegin is specific as neither PDI (Figure 7C,\nlane 6, WB \u0004CMG and lane 4, WB: \u0004PDI) nor ERp57 (Figure\n7C, lane 4, WB: \u0004ERp57) could be detected in calmegin\nimmunoprecipitates from testis lysates.\nThe PDILT-Calmegin Interaction Is Glycan-independent\nBoth calnexin and calmegin interact with nascent glycopro-\nteins in a glycan-dependent way (Ikawa et al., 1997). Because\nPDILT itself is glycosylated, PDILT could be one of these\nglycoproteins requiring assistance from calmegin to fold.\nAlternatively, PDILT could be a novel, nonredox active part-\nner for calmegin. To distinguish between these possibilities,\nmouse liver and testis lysates were mock-treated or treated\nwith endoH to remove glycans. EndoH treatment resulted in\nan increased electrophoretic mobility of PDILT, consistent\nwith the removal of the PDILT glycans (Figure 7D, lanes 3\nand 4, top panel) and confirming that endogenous PDILT is\nan ER-resident protein (van Lith et al., 2005). Calmegin is not\nglycosylated, and its mobility remained unchanged upon\nendoH treatment (Figure 7D, lanes 3 and 4, bottom panel).\nDeglycosylation had no effect on the efficiency of immuno-\nprecipitation of PDILT or calmegin (Figure 7D, lanes 7 and 8,\ntop panel, and lanes 11 and 12, bottom panel). The anti-\ncalmegin and anti-PDILT antisera coimmunoprecipitated\nPDILT and, more weakly, calmegin, respectively, from both\nmock- and endoH-treated samples (Figure 7D, lanes 11 and\n12, and 7 and 8), indicating that the calmegin\/PDILT inter-\naction was glycan-independent. These results suggest that\nPDILT is not merely a substrate for calmegin, but rather a\npartner for this lectin-like protein. The postmeiotic cells of\nthe testes therefore host a unique ER chaperone complex,\nFigure 6. PDILT self-associates. Wild-type (wt) or cysteine mutant\n(C135A\/C420A, denoted CA) HA- or myc-tagged PDILT was ex-\npressed in HeLa cells as indicated. Lysates were directly analyzed\n(lanes 1\u20134) or subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc\n(lanes 5\u20138) or anti-HA (lanes 9\u201312) before SDS-PAGE and Western\nblotting with anti-HA (bottom panel) and anti-myc (top panel).

It has recently\nbecome apparent that the physiology of tissue-specific\nfolding, misfolding, and quality control will be central to\ndiseases including those of the pancreas (e.g., diabetes;\nOzcan et al., 2006) and the CNS (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s Disease;\nUehara et al., 2006). The testes present a special case for\nthe control of ER protein folding because of the unusual\nenvironment; besides experiencing low temperature, de-\nveloping germ cells also require a new proteome and\nextensive organelle remodeling to produce the acrosome\nfor sperm\u2013 egg fusion.\nWe have used a range of methods to determine the\nexpression of an unusual, testis-specific, PDI homologue,\nPDILT. PDILT is exclusively found in postmeiotic germ\ncells (Figure 3A), an expression pattern that is conserved\nin mouse, rat, marmoset, macaque, and human (Figure 3,\nA and B). This is in dramatic contrast to other members of\nthe PDI protein family, including ERp57, ERp72, and PDI,\nwhich are expressed in all cell types of the testis (Figure\n3C). PDILT was not detected in testes at 21 or 28 d of\nlife, at a time when the most mature germ cell type was\nthe pachytene spermatocyte (Clermont and Perey, 1957),\nbut PDILT was detectable in testicular extracts and in cells\nnear the lumen of seminiferous tubules by day 30 or 31, a\ntime when the most mature germ cell types are haploid\nround spermatids (Figure 4). Thus PDILT seems to be\nrequired during spermiogenesis when round spermatids\ndifferentiate into mature spermatozoa. These dramatic\nmorphological changes are accompanied by the appear-\nance of many transcripts unique to this cell type, a num-\nber of which are also translationally regulated (Hecht,\n1990). Proteins unique to the haploid germ cells include\ntestis-specific histones, transition proteins and prota-\nmines, all of which are essential for the correct packaging\nof DNA into the sperm head (Yu et al., 2000; Adham et al.,\n2001) and proteins essential for the formation of the ac-\nrosome (Hurst et al., 1998) and flagellum (Brohmann et al.,\n1997). Male haploid germ cells also often express genes\nthat are variants of somatically expressed genes (Lin and\nMorrison-Bogorad, 1991; Hecht, 1998), and PDILT and\ncalmegin may represent such examples.\nPDILT shows the same domain architecture as PDI,\nERp57, and PDIp (Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005), but has a\nnumber of significant differences. Most notably, PDILT lacks\nthree of the four active site cysteine residues and other\nresidues required for redox activity, such as the equivalent\nto R120 in PDI (Lappi et al., 2004). It is therefore not surpris-\ning that PDILT is not catalytically active as a thiol-disulfide\noxidoreductase in any of the standard in vitro assays. How-\never, human PDILT does have two surface-exposed cysteine\nresidues, and these mediate distinct mixed disulfide com-\nplexes in cells (Figure 1E). In addition, PDILT does form\ncomplexes with the peptide \u0003-somatostatin (Figure 1G) and\nthe nonnative protein BPTI (data not shown). Because both\nnonnative BPTI and PDILT are soluble in isolation but\nquickly form aggregates when combined, the interaction\nbetween these proteins must result in a significant confor-\nmational change in at least one of them, probably caused by\nPDILT binding to hydrophobic residues in BPTI with sub-\nsequent exposure of other hydrophobic residues. PDI has\nthree distinct substrate-binding sites (Koivunen et al., 2005)\nand does not form aggregates in vitro, whereas ERp57 has\none of these sites specialized for the interaction with calre-\nticulin\/calnexin (Russell et al., 2004) and does form aggre-\ngates in vitro with nonnative BPTI and other nonnative\nproteins (Karala and Ruddock, unpublished observation).\nPDILT forms a complex with calmegin (Figure 7), consistent\nwith in vitro aggregation occurring to the PDI-family mem-\nbers that are part of a lectin complex in vivo.\nAlthough an indirect interaction between PDILT and\ncalmegin cannot be formally excluded, the association be-\nFigure 7. PDILT interacts with calmegin.

(B) Lysates from HeLa cells transfected with PDILT-\nmyc were directly analyzed (lane 1) or subjected to immunoprecipi-\ntation with anti-myc (lane 2) and anti-calmegin (lane 3).

The asterisk indicates a background band\noccasionally observed.\nM. van Lith et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2802\ntween the two proteins in the ER of spermatids is glycan-\nindependent (Figure 7). Thus, PDILT is not just a glycosy-\nlated substrate for calmegin, but is more likely to be a\npartner in a unique protein-folding system. Our inability to\ndetect calmegin-ERp57 and calmegin-PDI complexes in tes-\ntis suggests that the PDILT-calmegin complex performs a\nunique role in ER quality control, although some caution is\nrequired in interpreting negative immunoprecipitation data\n(Figure 7C). Because PDILT has no oxido-reductase activity\nin vitro and lacks the classical WCGHC motif of standard\noxidoreductases, it is likely that PDILT operates as a folding\nassistant for spermatid-specific glycoproteins that have been\nensnared by calmegin. This is supported by the observation\nthat calmegin interacts with nascent glycoproteins (Ikawa et\nal., 1997) and our finding that PDILT interacts in vitro with\nthe model peptide \u0003-somatostatin and the nonnative protein\nBPTI (Figure 1). The fact that PDILT can be recovered in\ndisulfide dependent complexes from transfected cells (Fig-\nure 1E) and as complexes from testes (van Lith et al., 2005)\nsuggests that both PDILTs solvent-exposed cysteine resi-\ndues may trap free single cysteines in substrates, perhaps\nusing them as a molecular handle to facilitate protein fold-\ning of the peptide backbone. Whether noncovalent PDILT-\nPDILT complexes (Figure 6) have an independent functional\nrole in vivo, or perhaps operate as an inactive chaperone\nreservoir, requires further investigation. Together, our work\nidentifies a new quality control hub unique to the ER of\nspermatids, alongside the ERp57\/calnexin and BiP\/PDI\npartnerships found in somatic cells (Molinari and Helenius,\n2000). Although calnexin presents nonnative glycoproteins\nto the redox-active ERp57, the glycan recognition is de-\ncoupled from the redox activity for the PDILT\/calmegin\npair. It will now be important to determine whether calme-\ngin and PDILT work on similar or independent substrates to\nERp57 and PDI, given that both PDI and ERp57 are also\nexpressed in postmeiotic cells (Figure 3C). Now that ap-\nproaches to determine the substrate specificity of ERp57\nhave been successful (Jessop et al., 2007), it should be possi-\nble to identify the range of endogenous PDILT substrates by\nproteomics and the in vivo role of PDILT homodimerization\n(Figure 6), once the limitations of transfecting and culturing\ngerm cells have been overcome.\nAnother interesting possibility is that PDILT is required\nfor specific events during meiosis, such as remodeling the\nER in preparation for acrosome formation and the expulsion\nof the cytoplasmic body. Both PDI and ERp29 are involved\nin ERAD of microbial proteins (Tsai and Rapoport, 2002;\nMagnuson et al., 2005), and it may be that PDILT is required\nfor unfolding and retrotranslocation of ER proteins during\nthe programmed disposal of the residual body. Further-\nmore, ERp57 is found at the surface of sperm and is required\nfor disulfide bond exchange in preparation for gamete fu-\nsion (Ellerman et al., 2006). The C-terminal QEDL motif of\nERp57 is inefficiently retrieved by the KDEL receptors,\nmeaning that ERp57 may be more reliant on its associa-\ntion with ER-resident proteins for its retention than other\nPDIs (Raykhel, Alananen, and Ruddock, unpublished\ndata). Thus one possibility is that PDILT regulates ERp57\nexport to the cell surface by competing with ERp57 for\ncalmegin and calnexin and allowing monomeric ERp57 to\nbe exported from the ER. In vitro experiments with the\npurified, glycosylated components will be required to deter-\nmine the relative affinities of these proteins for each other.\nCalmegin is required for fertility (Ikawa et al., 1997),\nand it will be important to determine whether PDILT-\ndeficient mice are also infertile. With many human male\ninfertility cases unexplained, identifying genes and path-\nways associated with infertility remains a public health\npriority.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Laura Walters, David Dixon, and Helen McPhee for technical\nassistance and Neil Bulleid, Lars Ellgaard, Ineke Braakman, and Yoshitake\nNishimune for reagents.\nREFERENCES\nAdham, I.
