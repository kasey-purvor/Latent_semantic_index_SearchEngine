INTRODUCTION\nThe Medium Energy Neutral Atom sMENAd instrument\non the IMAGE spacecraft1 was designed to image the ener-\ngetic neutral atom sENAd emissions from the earth\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere over an energy-per mass range of 1\u201360 keV\/amu\nwith a nominal angular resolution of 4\u00b0 34\u00b0. The instrument\nis comprised of a set of three snominallyd identical sensor\n\u201cheads\u201d with head 2 pointing perpendicular to the spacecraft\nspin axis and heads 3 and 1 offset by \u00b120\u00b0 with respect to the\nperpendicular direction. Photographs of the MENA instru-\nment mounted on the IMAGE spacecraft and also in the\nlaboratory during calibration are shown in Figs. 1sad and\n1sbd. In panel sad, the spin axis of the spacecraft points to-\nward the top of the page, and the MENA instrument is\nmarked with an arrow. From left to right the heads are iden-\ntified as: head 3, head 2, and head 1. The heads image only in\nthe polar angle direction swith respect to the spin axisd and\nare collimated in the azimuthal direction fthe transmission\nprobability in the azimuthal direction has a full width at half\nmaximum sFWHMd of approximately \u00b14\u00b0g. Imaging in the\nazimuthal direction is facilitated by the rotation of the space-\ncraft sthe spin period is nominally 120 sd. Three heads are\nrequired in order to increase the total field of view sFOVd in\nthe polar angle direction and in order to fill in the central\ngaps in coverage in each head.\nA schematic illustration of the imaging concept for a\nsingle head is shown in Fig. 1sdd. Incident ENAs are initially\ncollimated in azimuth by a set of 21 curved parallel plates.\nThese plates are alternately biased with high voltage son the\norder of 3 kVd in order to sweep out ions with energies up to\nabout 20 keV. An ENA must then pass through a freestand-\ning transmission grating nano-structure designed to transmit\nheavy particles but reject UV photons. Following this, the\nENA passes through a thin carbon foil smounted on the bot-\ntom side of the grating structured. ENAs exiting the foil gen-\nerate secondary electrons that we call \u201cstart electrons.\u201d These\nelectrons are accelerated by a grid which causes them to\nmove very rapidly downward to the microchannel plate\nsMCPd detector in a z-stack configuration that subsequently\ngenerates a \u201cstart pulse\u201d on a \u201cstart\u201d position-sensitive an-\node. Meanwhile, the ENA continues on in a straight line path\nto impact the MCP detector and generates a \u201cstop\u201d pulse on\nthe stop position-sensitive anode. Although they are mounted\non a single board, the start and stop anodes are physically\nseparated and electrically isolated, each having its own pro-\ncessing electronics. The stop anode lies on both sides of the\nstart anode, and the two halves of this split anode are elec-\ntrically coupled. The total variation in gain across the MCP is\n,10%.1\nThe quantities that are measured and reported for the\ndetection of and ENA are: start position, stop position, start\npulse height, stop pulse height, time of flight sTOFd, head\nidentification sIDd, and the 4\u00b0-wide azimuthal sector in\nwhich the event occurred. The TOF is measured as the time\ndifference between the start pulse and the stop pulse. On\nboard the spacecraft, these quantities are all described using\n8 bit words and the on-board image processing can take ad-\nvantage of the full digital resolution. However, the direct-\nevents data that get telemetered to the ground have a reduced\nresolution.

A further\ncomplication is that, due to telemetry constraints, only a sub-\nset of the measured direct events can be included in the tele-\nmetered direct events data set stypically we receive no more\nthan <13 000 events per spin on the groundd.\nFor the azimuth bin, the direct events data contain a 6 bit\ncoarse resolution word specifying an 8\u00b0-wide azimuth bin,\nplus a 1 bit word indicating whether the event occurred in\nthe lower 4\u00b0 portion of the 8\u00b0 bin or the upper 4\u00b0 portion of\nthe 8\u00b0 bin. However, since the size of the telemetry buffer\nallocated for MENA typically allows for the storage of no\nmore than <13 000 direct events sper spind there is a limited\nnumber of events that can be reported back to the ground in\none spin of the spacecraft. Thus the quota of reported events\nis usually spent on those that occurred in the lower half of\nthe coarse bin. This unfortunately limits the azimuthal reso-\nlution of the direct events data to just 8\u00b0 or 45 bins per spin\nas indicated by the bracketed quantity in Table I.\nIn addition to the direct events data, we also receive on\nthe ground the total singles counts for start, stop, and valid\nscoincidenced events in each head accumulated over an entire\nspin. These quantities allow us to scale the direct event count\nrates up to what was observed on board\u2014although this scal-\ning process does not compensate for the poorer counting\nstatistics inherent in the direct-events data.\nBefore launch it was anticipated that the measured quan-\ntities would be used as follows. First, the start and stop po-\nsitions would be used to determine the incident angle, j. The\nTOF and incident angle would be used to determine the\nspeed. The pulse heights were then supposed to allow for\nresolution of mass se.g., H or Od. And finally the energy\nwould be determined from the mass and speed. In practice,\nthis scheme works very well except that so far, we have not\nbeen successful in using the pulse heights to extract species\ninformation. Thus, for the time being we assume that all the\nENAs are hydrogen. However, as we shall see later in this\ndocument, there is still a chance that we may yet be able to\nseparate hydrogen and oxygen in the direct-events data.\nA much more detailed description of the MENA instru-\nment can be found elsewhere.1 In this document, we focus\nspecifically on the process of converting the raw direct-\nevents data into images with units of integral and differential\nflux. In doing so, we present a first-principles calculation of\nthe MENA geometric factors based on a detailed understand-\ning of the physical design of the instrument. Following this,\nwe discuss issues associated with energy binning and we\npresent a solution that not only overcomes these issues, but\nalso offers the possibility of extracting species information as\nwell.\nII.

However, it can also be evaluated se.g., via Monte\nCarlo integrationd for more complex trajectories se.g., curved\ntrajectories of charged particles in a magnetic fieldd. In addi-\ntion, Tuszewski, Cayton, and Ingraham3 have recently ex-\ntended Sullivan\u2019s formalism to analytically include more\ncomplicated particle trajectories that can contribute to the\ncount rate despite the fact that they do not necessarily pass\nthrough the geometrical apertures. This newer \u201canalytical\nprobability\u201d sAPd approach can account for features such as\npenetrating particles, scattering, reflections and secondary\nbremsstrahlung photons. Although in future work we may\nneed to include some of these more complicated effects, here\nwe will restrict our calculations to simple straight-line trajec-\ntories that have a clear geometrical path through the aperture\nand adopt Sullivan\u2019s original formalism.\nIn order to greatly simplify the above expression, we\nassume: s1d only a single species is present sor we can sepa-\nrate multiple speciesd; s2d the detection efficiency does not\nvary with position on the detector; s3d the detection effi-\nciency is constant over the integration time; s4d the incident\nflux does not change over the integration time, and; s5d the\nenergy and angular dependencies of the incident flux are\nseparable such that jsE ,u ,fd= j0sEdFsu ,fd. Then sin spheri-\ncal polar coordinatesd, we can rewrite Eq. s1d in terms of a\n\u201cdirectional response function,\u201d RsE ,u ,fd and an \u201cinstru-\nment gathering power,\u201d GsEd.\nThe directional response function sor \u201ceffective area\u201d as\nit is often calledd is defined as\nRsE,u,fd = t sE,u,fdE\nS\nu\u02c6 \u00b7 ds s2d\n=t sE,u,fdAsu,fd , s3d\nwhere Asu ,fd is the projected area in the direction su ,fd and\nt sE ,u ,fd can be thought of as an additional direction and\nenergy dependent probability for particles to get to the de-\ntector se.g., due to the collimating structures and start foil in\nour cased. The instrument gathering power is defined as\nGsEd = E\nu\nE\nf\nRsE,u,fdFsu,fdsinu du df . s4d\nThus, Eq. s1d can be rewritten as\nC = E\nE\nj0sEd GsEd dE . s5d\nNote that if the incident flux is constant over the angular\nrange of integration, we can set Fsu ,fd=1. The gathering\npower then becomes the familiar \u201cgeometric factor,\u201d G given\nby\nGsEd = E\nu\nE\nf\nRsE,u,fd sinu du df . s6d\nFurthermore, if jsEd is approximately constant over the en-\nergy integration range, we have the familiar flux conversion\nformula\nC = j0sEdGsEdDE s7d\nor\nj0sEd =\nC\nGsEdDE\n. s8d\nAs we shall see later, the generation of differential flux im-\nages from the direct events data is not quite as simple as\napplying this formula to every pixel, but we will still need to\ncompute fluxes with it.\nIn order to proceed with the calculation of the geometric\nfactors, it is crucially important to recognize what coinci-\ndence measurements we are actually making with the MENA\ninstrument. Unlike more conventional particle telescopes, the\nMENA instrument is inherently an imaging device. Thus, we\nare not just interested in the fact that a neutral atom passed\nthrough the entrance aperture and hit the detector\u2014that is\nnot the measurement that we are after. Instead, we are inter-\nested in making a large number of individual measurements\nof the following sort: a particle passed through a small por-\ntion of the entrance aperture and landed in a small portion of\nthe detector. In other words, we are making measurements of\nthe count rate observed when a particle has a specific start-\nbyte value and a specific stop-byte value. A single head can\nthen be thought of as one that is comprised of son the order\nofd 163128 individual little particle telescopes\u2014as many as\n16 start-byte \u201capertures\u201d and as many as 128 stop-byte \u201cde-\ntectors.\u201d In practice, for MENA, only ten start-byte values\nmap to physical regions in the entrance aperture. And there\nare also substantially fewer than 128 \u201cvalid\u201d stop-byte values\npossible due to the fact that the central portion of the position\nsensitive anode is dedicated to measuring start events.\nAnother way to think about this is to imagine a some-\nwhat differently designed instrument. Let us suppose that the\nentrance aperture really was a narrow slit and the detector\nplane was comprised of an array of 128 discrete silicon de-\ntectors. Then it is easy to see that each aperture\/detector pair\ncomprises a separate particle telescope. This type of design is\nin fact implemented in the Polar CEPPAD\/inverse photo-\nemission spectroscopy sIPSd instrument4 on a much smaller\nscale. In IPS, there are three collimated heads and each head\nis comprised of a slit camera with three discrete silicon de-\ntectors. With MENA, we essentially have ten of these slit\ndetectors stacked next to each other by virtue of the fact that\nthe start-byte value tells us the \u201csubaperture\u201d through which\nthe particle entered the instrument. In essence, the MENA\n043303-3 Calculation of MENA geometric factors Rev. Sci. Instrum. 76, 043303 ~2005!\nDownloaded 16 Oct 2006 to 194.80.32.10. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\ndesign is the same as the IPS design except that both the\nphysical location of the entrance aperture and the physical\nbounds of each detector are electronically selected\u2014and this\nelectronic selection is accomplished via the start- and stop-\nbyte assignments.\nIn this interpretation of the MENA instrument, the spe-\ncific start-byte value corresponds to a physical aperture\nwidth and the specific stop-byte value corresponds to a\nphysical area on the detector. Thus, with knowledge about\nhow the start and stop-byte values map to physical space, we\ncan compute the projected area of each subdetector. This is\nexactly what is done in the following section.\nIII. PROJECTED AREA FOR A START-BYTE\/STOP-\nBYTE PAIR\nThe projected area, Asu ,fd, for a two-element telescope\nis easily computed using the so-called \u201cshadow area\u201d method\nse.g., Sullivan2d. In spherical-polar coordinates fFig. 2sadg,\nAsu ,fd is given by\nAsu,fd = Ashadowsu,fd \u00b7 u\u02c6 , s9d\nwhere, Ashadowsu ,fd is the overlapping surface area that re-\nsults when the aperture is parallel projected down to the de-\ntector si.e., it can be thought of as the area of the \u201cshadow\u201d\nthat the aperture casts on the detectord, and u\u02c6\n= scos u cos f , cos u sin f , sin ud is the direction the response\nis computed for. If the aperture and detector planes are in the\ny\u2212z plane then Ashadowsu ,fd= sAs ,0 ,0d so that\nAsu,fd = Assu,fdcos f cos u . s10d\nAlthough Sullivan2 gives Asu ,fd for a two-element detector\nwith different-sized rectangular apertures, the geometry is\nvalid only for elements that are centered on the x axis. Since\nwe wish to compute the geometric factor for each and every\nstart-byte\/stop-byte combination, we need to compute the di-\nFIG. 2. sColor onlined sad Definition of coordinate system used to compute\nthe projected area. sbd Schematic showing area overlap in the z or \u201cimaging\u201d\ndirection. The start-byte aperture is shown projected down to the detector\nplane at three different angles. The left and right cases illustrate partial\noverlap while the central case illustrates complete overlap. As j increases,\nthe area of overlap will first increase linearly from zero to a maximum\n\u201cplateau\u201d value and then decrease linearly from the maximum value back to\nzero. fE.g., see Fig. 4sbd.g scd Area overlap in the y or \u201ccollimated\u201d direction.\nIn sbd and scd, the relative sizes of the start and stop regions are not to scale.\nFIG. 3.

Instrum. 76, 043303 ~2005!\nDownloaded 16 Oct 2006 to 194.80.32.10.

The u and f angles are the\nspherical-polar coordinates snote that u is the latitude instead\nof the co-latituded and j is the angle between the x axis and\nthe projection of the three-dimensional s3Dd vector onto the\nx-z plane. Also shown is the relationship between j, u, and\nf. Figure 1scd illustrates how a MENA head is oriented rela-\ntive to this coordinate system.\nThe overlap in the z direction si.e., the imaging direc-\ntiond is shown schematically in Fig. 2sbd. For a given start\nbyte, the detector is like a slit camera. And if we consider\nalso only a single stop byte, then the detector has just the\nwidth of that stop byte. The values of za, zb, zc, zd have been\ndetermined experimentally for each start byte and stop byte\nand can be computed via empirically determined polynomi-\nals. The quantities ze and zf give the start-byte position pro-\njected down to the MCP at an angle of j. Thus\nze = za \u2212 L tan j = za \u2212 L\ntan u\ncos f\n,\nzf = zb \u2212 L tan j = zb \u2212 L\ntan u\ncos f\n.\nIf we define the quantities\nz1 = maxszc,zed , s11d\nz2 = minszd,zfd s12d\nthen the overlap distance is given by\nZ = maxsz2 \u2212 z1,0d . s13d\nFigure 2scd shows the geometry in the y direction si.e.,\ncollimated directiond and proceeding as above, we have\nye = ya \u2212 L tan f ,\nyf = yb \u2212 L tan f\nand\ny1 = maxsyc,yed , s14d\ny2 = minsyd,yfd , s15d\nwhich gives the following for the overlap distance in the y\ndirection:\nY = maxsy2 \u2212 y1,0d . s16d\nThe shadow area sas a vector quantityd is then given as\nAshadow = sYZ,0,0d . s17d\nFinally, with, u\u02c6= scos u cos f , cos u sin f , sin ud, the pro-\njected area is given by\nAijksu,fd = Ashadow \u00b7 u\u02c6 = YZ cos f cos u , s18d\nwhere the subscripts i, j, and k refer to individual start byte,\nstop byte, and head values. Note that since the empirically\ndetermined mapping from bytes to position sfor both start\nand stop bytesd is different for each of the heads, the Aijk will\nin general all be somewhat different.\nIn order to proceed with the calculations outlined above,\nwe must know the physical values of za, zb, zc, zd, ya, yb, yc,\nand yd for each of the start and stop-byte combinations for all\nthree heads. The mappings from start and stop bytes to\nphysical position along the anode have been determined\nfrom calibration data. The start-byte-to-position mappings\nwere fit with straight lines for all heads as shown in Fig. 3sad,\nand the stop-byte-to-position mappings were fit with cubic\npolynomials as shown sfor head 2d in Fig. 3sbd. The position\nversus byte polynomials adopted for each head are as fol-\nlows:\nHead 1\nZstart = \u2212 0.918 75 + 0.025B ,\nZstop = \u2212 6.0695 + 0.064 491B \u2212 2.1694e \u2212 4 B2\n+ 4.9283e \u2212 7 B3.\nHead 2\nZstart = \u2212 0.918 75 + 0.025B ,\nFIG. 4.

This combined with the trigonometric\nfactors in expression s18d give rise to the variability in the upper envelope in\nsad.

Although in the\nfuture, we may be able to recover some additional informa-\ntion from the calibration data and\/or utilize on-orbit data\nacquired from all three heads to place constraints on the head\n3 mappings, this is a complicated task and is beyond the\nscope of the present article. Therefore, for our present pur-\nposes, the stop-byte-to-position polynomial for head 3 was\nderived by averaging the coefficients from heads 1 and 2.\nThe above polynomials were initially used to derive the\nstart\/stop byte-to-angle mappings for both the on-board and\nstatistics data. They are still used for the on-board data, but\nfor the statistics processing we have adopted new angle look\nup tables sLUTsd that were re-derived from the calibration\ndata in a different manner.\nFigure 4 illustrates the projected area obtained for a start\nbyte of 7 in head 2 at f=0\u00b0.

COLLIMATOR TRANSMISSION PROBABILITY\nIn the previous section, we computed the directional re-\nsponse function for a two-element detector comprised of a\nsingle narrow start-byte aperture and a single narrow stop-\nbyte detector. This would be sufficient for the MENA instru-\nment if there were no collimator, no transmission gratings\nand no grating support structures. In reality, particles must\nget through all of those additional apertures before they\nreach the \u201cstart-byte aperture\u201d on the foil. In order to deal\nwith this further complication, we introduce a transmission\nfunction that specifies, for a given direction, the probability\nthat a particle will reach the foil.\nIn this section we examine the types of collimating\nstructures found in the IMAGE\/MENA collimator\/\ntransmission grating assembly and we determine, analyti-\ncally, the separate transmission probability functions associ-\nated with each. These probability transmission functions are\nthen combined together in order to obtain the overall trans-\nmission probability.\nA.

In the lower part of the figure, enlarged\nviews of the coarse triangular nickel support mesh, the fine\nnickel support bars, and the gold bars of the transmission\ngrating are shown.\nThe fabrication of the transmission gratings is an ex-\ntremely difficult process because the gold bars have to be\nTABLE II.

As a result of this difficulty,\neach transmission grating produced for MENA had some-\nwhat different rejection\/transmission characteristics. In addi-\ntion, two different \u201clots\u201d were manufactured for MENA: Lot\nU02 and Lot U04. In total, approximately 77 gratings were\nmounted in frames for possible use in MENA. To keep track\nof them all, an inventory numbering system was devised to\nidentify the lot number, the wafer ID and the frame number.\nAfter defects were repaired spatching pinholesd and the\nUV-rejection and ion transmission characteristics of each\ngrating\/frame assembly were measured, 15 were selected for\nthe flight instrument\u2014three from lot U02 and 12 from lot\nU04. Table II indicates which gratings went into each of the\nMENA heads.\nA series of scanning electron micrographs sSEMsd of a\nMENA transmission grating are presented in Fig. 6. The\nframe ID for this grating assembly is IB030. It comes from\nLot U02 and has wafer and scribe ID numbers of U02H007\nand 2994, respectively. Due to a variety of defects, this grat-\ning was not considered flight quality. The large rectangular\nhole in the grating was intentionally cut with an ion beam in\norder to measure the cross-sectional dimensions of the gold\nbars and fine nickel support structures.\n1. Fine nickel supports\nThe fine nickel bars that support the gold gratings have\neither a rectangular or a slightly trapezoidal cross section as\nshown schematically in Fig. 7. The angle b is measured from\nthe normal incidence direction perpendicular to the collimat-\ning bars while the angle a is measured from the normal\nincidence direction parallel to the collimating bars. Given\nthe symmetry of the collimating structures, we note that\nt s+a ,bd=t s\u2212a ,bd and t sa , +bd=t sa ,\u2212bd.\nFor the rectangular geometry, the probability of getting\nthrough the structure can be computed as shown in Fig. 7sbd.\nFrom this figure, we can see that if a beam comprised of\nFIG. 6.

Since d=D\u2212H tan b and tan b+\n=D \/H ssee figured, where b+ is the maximum angle that can\nmake it through, we have for the transmission probability,\nt=1\u2212tan b \/ tan b+.\nNote that in terms of the angles a and b\u2014which are\nthe angles in the parallel and perpendicular planes,\nrespectively\u2014the transmission probability is independent of\na.\nAn additional factor for the overall transmission prob-\nability needs to be taken into account: the probability of\nactually hitting a gap as opposed to hitting a bar. This prob-\nability is just given by \u00ab=D \/ sD+Wd, where D is the gap\nwidth and W is the bar sor plated width. Thus, the overall\ntransmission probability for a collimating structure with rect-\nangular bars is given by\nt sa,bd = \u00ab51 \u2212 tan btan b+ ubu , b+0 else 8 , s19d\ntan b+ =\nD\nH\n, s20d\n\u00ab =\nD\nsD + Wd\n. s21d\nFIG. 7. sColor onlined.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\nFor the trapezoidal geometry, the probability of getting\nthrough the structure can be computed as shown in Fig. 7sdd.\nProceeding as above, the overall transmission probability for\nthis collimating structure is given by\ntsa,bd = \u00ab5\n1 ubu , b1s23d\n1 \u2212\ntanb \u2212 tanb1\ntan b+ \u2212 tan b1\nb1 , ubu , b+,\n0 else\n6 s22d\ntan b+ =\na + D\nH\n, s23d\ntan b1 =\na\nH\n, s24d\n\u00ab =\nD\nsD + WTd\n, s25d\na =\nWT \u2212 WB\n2\n, s26d\nwhich is again independent of a.\nThe actual dimensions of the fine nickel support struc-\ntures were determined from measurements of SEMs as\nshown in Fig. 6scd. Although there is probably a slight trap-\nezoidal shape to the fine nickel support bars, the SEMs ana-\nlyzed so far suggest that the departure from a rectangular\ngeometry is very small. Thus, assuming the nickel bars are\nrectangular in cross section, the dimensions obtained from\nFig. 6sdd indicate that average bar width, height and period\nare 1.13, 0.93, and 3.96 mm, respectively.\n2. Curved collimator plates\nThe large curved collimator plates on MENA si.e., the\nbrass-colored plates shown at the top of Fig. 5d can be\nthought of as very narrow and tall rectangular bars that are\ncurved into arc shapes. The above transmission probability\nfor the rectangular geometry is still valid for this case if we\nnote that the height of each bar decreases by a factor of\ncos a. Thus, for the curved collimators, the transmission\nprobability is dependent on a because the value of b+ in-\ncreases as a increases.\n3. Gold grating bars\nAlthough the gold grating bars were intended to have a\nrectangular geometry, technical limitations in their fabrica-\ntion lead to bars that have a more \u201cbarrel-shaped\u201d geometry.\nBy this we mean that the cross section of each bar is like a\nrectangle with \u201cbulging\u201d sides si.e., each bar looks like a\nbarrel when viewed edge ond. Here we develop an analytic\nexpression for the transmission function associated with such\nstructures under the assumption that the bulging sides can be\nexpressed as arcs of circles.\nThe barrel geometry can be approximated by the inter-\nsection of a rectangular bar and two cylinders as shown in\nFigs. 8sad and 8sbd. From the lower part of panel sad, we can\nsee what the radius of each circle needs to be, given that we\nknow the height h of a bar and the distance c that the middle\nof the bar sticks out relative to the tops and bottoms of the\nbar\nr =\nh2 + 4c2\n8c\n. s27d\nIf the gap between two bars is given by D, and we place the\norigin at the center of the gap, then the circle defining the left\nside of the gap is centered at a point \u2212sD \/2+rd, while the\ncircle defining the right side of the gap is centered at a point\n+sD \/2+rd.\nAs shown in Fig. 8scd, the transmission probability, t, is\ngiven by the quantity d \/D, where D is the sknownd gap\nwidth and the distance d is a function of the angle b. Note\nthat, as with the rectangular and trapezoidal geometries dis-\ncussed above, since b is defined as the angle between the y\naxis and the projection of the ray onto the x-y plane, the\ntransmission probability will be independent of the angle a\nswhich is defined as the angle between the y axis and the\nprojection of the ray onto the y-z planed.\nIn order to compute the transmission probability for this\ntype of collimating structure, we note that there are three\ndistinct cases to consider. The first case occurs when the\nincident rays enter the gap such that they are tangent to the\ncylindrical portions of the barrels. This will occur when ubu\n,b0. The second case occurs when b0, ubu,b1. In this\ncase the incident rays are tangent to the cylinders at points\nthat are not on the defined barrel. In this regime, d is calcu-\nlated simply by considering the corner points as we did for\nthe rectangular geometry. Finally, the third case occurs when\nubu.b1. For this case no rays can get through and the prob-\nability must be 0.\nFrom Fig. 8sdd, we can see that the limiting angles are\ngiven by\nsin b0 = h\/2r , s28d\ntan b1 = s2c + Dd\/h . s29d\nAlso, from Fig. 8sbd, we see that for ubu,b0\nd = D + 2rS1 \u2212 1\ncos b\nD\nand, since t=d \/D,\nt = 1 +\nh2 + 4c2\n4cD S1 \u2212 1cos bD .\nWhen b0, ubu,b1, the transmission probability can be\ncomputed as we did for the simple rectangular bars with a\nsmall modification. Note that D in this case is not the dis-\ntance between the corner points\u2014it is the gap between the\nbulging centers. So in this case, d+h tan b=D+2c, so that\n043303-9 Calculation of MENA geometric factors Rev. Sci. Instrum. 76, 043303 ~2005!\nDownloaded 16 Oct 2006 to 194.80.32.10.

Coarse nickel supports\nThe coarse triangular nickel support mesh is a much\nmore macroscopic structure than either the fine nickel sup-\nport bars or the gold grating bars. In addition, as shown in\nthe scanning electron micrograph in Fig. 9sad, it lies in the\nsame layer and has the same height as the fine nickel support\nbars. As a result, the modification of the overall angular de-\npendence of the transmission characteristics due to the coarse\nmesh will be very small. Thus, for the coarse triangular mesh\nwe assume a uniform constant transmission factor of 0.899.\nThis value is derived from the dimensions shown in Fig.\n9sbd.\nFIG. 8. sColor onlined sa, bd Defining the \u201cbarrel\u201d geometry in terms of intersecting cylinders. scd The transmission probability that results when the incident\nparallel rays are tangent to the cylindrical sidewalls. sdd When b.bo, the rays are no longer tangent to the cylindrical sidewalls.

Overall transmission efficiency\n1.

Note that we have left these terms as\nfunctions of j and f for clarity. It is a simple task to make\nthem functions of u and f instead.\n2. Energy dependence\nSince all atoms with energies above about 1 keV are\nable to make it through the foil, the transmission efficiency\nabove 1 keV is taken to be 100%. Below 1 keV the trans-\nmission efficiency will begin to drop due to the finite thick-\nness of the carbon foil. In this regime, the efficiency will also\nbe dependent upon the angle of incidence since the path\nlength through the foil is dependent upon the angle of inci-\ndence. A detailed calculation of these efficiencies can be\nmade using the TRIM code,5 but for our present purposes we\nwill simply restrict our analysis to energies above 1 keV and\nassume sto a good approximationd that there is no energy\ndependence to the transmission efficiency.\n3. Postfoil detection efficiency\nFor ENAs that make it through the collimator, transmis-\nsion grating and foil, an additional postfoil detection effi-\nciency must be taken into account. This additional efficiency\nresults from a number of individual efficiencies including:\nthe probability of generating secondary electrons in the foil;\nthe probability of detecting the primary ENA; the probability\nof detecting the secondary start electrons; and the probability\nof making it through the accelerating and shields grids. Al-\nthough this combined efficiency is not easy to compute from\nfirst principles, it can be measured in a relatively simple\nFIG. 9. sad SEM showing a corner region of the coarse nickel mesh. The\nfine nickel bars are the medium-sized horizontal structures and the much\nsmaller gold grating bars can be seen as vertical white stripes below them.\nNote that the coarse mesh is the same height as the fine nickel supports and\ntherefore does not significantly alter the transmission characteristics. sbd\nDimensions and transmission efficiency, T, of the coarse triangular nickel\nsupport mesh snot to scaled.\n043303-11 Calculation of MENA geometric factors Rev.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\nmanner in the laboratory using a combination of the coinci-\ndence and singles rates from the start and stop portions of the\ndetector.\nIf ENAs are passing through the foil at a rate S and at an\nangle of incidence such that the parallel-projected area of the\nentrance aperture falls completely within the active area of\nthe stop detector, then the individual singles rates in the start\nand stop detectors will be given by: RA=\u00abAS and RB=\u00abBS,\nrespectively. Furthermore, if the detectors are independent,\nthe coincidence rate will be: RAB=\u00abA\u00abBS+Rch=\u00abS+Rch\nwhere the overall postfoil detection efficiency, \u00ab, is equal to\n\u00abA\u00abB. Here, Rch is the chance coincidence rate which is ap-\nproximately given by TRARB, where T is the coincidence\ntime window. In our case, the overall postfoil efficiency is\nnear 40% and the laboratory measurements were taken with\nsingles rates on the order of 1 kHz and a time window of\napproximately 300 ns. Therefore sin the laboratoryd, Rch is\nnegligible in comparison to the total measured coincidence\nrate, RAB, and can be safely neglected.\nSince S=RAB \/\u00ab, we have \u00abA\u00abB= s\u00abRA \/RABd\n3 s\u00abRB \/RABd=\u00ab. Thus\n\u00ab =\nsRABd2\nRARB\n. s32d\nUse of this formula together with measurements of the coin-\ncidence and singles rates taken in the laboratory prior to\nlaunch gives a total overall postfoil detection efficiency of\n\u00ab=0.424.\n4. Overall detection efficiency\nFinally, a total transmission probability as a function of\nlook direction can be defined as the product of all the rel-\nevant probabilities\nt su,fd = tCsfd 3 tTGsu,fd 3 tNSsu,fdtCM 3 \u00ab . s33d\nThe various dimensions assumed for the three collimating\nstructures are summarized in Table III and plots showing the\ndependence of tC, tTG, tNS, and t on the angles a and f are\nshown in Fig. 10.\nV. GEOMETRIC FACTORS\nFor each start and stop-byte combination, we can define\na geometric factor as follows:\nGijk = E\nu=\u2212p\/2\n+p\/2 E\nf=0\np\nAijksu,fdtsu,fd cosu du df . s34d\nHere, i and j correspond to start- and stop-byte numbers and\nk corresponds to the head number s0, 1, or 2d.\nThe Gijk for IMAGE\/MENA were computed snumeri-\ncallyd and are shown in Fig. 11. Note that there is a very\nsignificant degree of asymmetry in each head and that the\nthree heads are all different. The anomalously low ampli-\ntudes for start bytes 4 and 14 are due to the fact that those\nstart bytes correspond to physical entrance apertures at the\nedges of the grating and are therefore chopped to smaller\nsizes than those start bytes that map to the central regions of\nthe grating. Similarly, start bytes f0\u20133, 15g all map to regions\noutside of the entrance aperture and therefore they all have\nG;0.\nVI. CULLING OF DIRECT EVENTS\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have so far ignored the\nfact that each head actually has a central blind spot. This\nblind spot exists because the section of the detector area\nbelow the start foil must be dedicated to detecting start elec-\ntrons and cannot simultaneously detect ENAs. Therefore, in\nreality, the geometric factors for each start byte will drop\nvery rapidly to zero for stop-byte values that map to the start\nsection of the position sensitive detector. The exact stop-byte\nranges where the count rates first begin to drop for each start\nbyte can be easily determined from the data itself. We have\ncompiled these values into a \u201cmask\u201d array which we use to\n\u201ccull out\u201d start\/stop-byte pairs that map within or close to the\nedges of the central blind spot. This simple approach allows\nus to use the geometric factors shown in Fig. 11 without\nmodification since the nonphysical regions will never be\nused. fNote that the specific start\/stop-byte pairs that we cull\ncan be seen as black areas in the angle look up tables sLUTsd\nshown later in Fig. 12sad.g\nVII. COMPARISON WITH ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION\nThe effective area at various incident angles for heads 1\nand 2 in the MENA instrument were measured in the labo-\nratory prior to launch. A broad beam source of H+ and O+ at\n31 keV and of H+ at 9 keV were used for this purpose. The\nbeam was broad enough to fill the entrance aperture and was\nmeasured to have very low divergence s<0.1\u00b0 d so that, to a\nvery good approximation, it can be considered as a parallel-\nTABLE III.

The \u201cstop-bytes\u201d column indi-\ncates which stop bytes actually contributed to the sum sfor\nu=20\u00b0d.

We\ncould have guessed this from the outset, but the above analy-\nsis provides an excellent check on our calculations of the\nbyte-dependent projected area curves slike those shown in\nFig. 4d.\nAlthough there is considerable uncertainty in the mea-\nsurements for the effective area, our calculated value for\nhead 2 is reasonably close to the measured value of\n0.11\u00b10.06 cm2 and is well within the uncertainty range.\nVIII. INTEGRAL FLUX IMAGES\nFrom Eq. s5d, the count rate for a given start byte\nsi indexd, stop byte sj indexd, head ID sk indexd, and azimuth\nbin s, indexd is given by\nCijk, = E\nE\nj0,ijk,sEdGijksEddE . s36d\nSince the angular distribution of the differential flux does not\nvary much over a start-byte\/stop-byte pair, we can safely set\nFsu ,fd=1 so that GijksEd=GijksEd. Furthermore, if the over-\nall detection efficiency is independent of energy sfor energies\nabove about 1 keV this is a good approximationd, then\nGijksEd=Gijk. We then have\nCijk, = GijkE\nE\nj0,ijk,sEddE . s37d\nTo define an \u201cintegral flux,\u201d Jijkl, we accumulate counts\nfrom a given lower cutoff energy, Eo, up to E=\u2018. Then\nCijk, = GijkE\nE+\n\u2018\nj0,ijk,sEddE = GijkJijk,. s38d\nThe integral flux, J, is therefore given by\nJijk, =\nCijk,\nGijk\n. s39d\nTo perform this calculation for the IMAGE\/MENA\ndirect-events data, for each head and azimuth bin, counts are\nfirst accumulated into stop-byte\/start-byte bins. Then the to-\ntal count rate for that bin, Cijk,, is divided by the correspond-\ning geometric factor, Gijk. Each of the resulting integral\nfluxes are then mapped to the polar angle implied by their ijk\nvalues. The interactive graphical tool shown in Fig. 12sad\nillustrates this process step by step. The top three rows show\nthe process for heads 1, 2, and 3 separately, while the bottom\nrow shows all three heads combined. From left to right the\ntop three rows show: s1d the polar angle look up table sLUTd\nas a function of start shorizontal dimensiond and stop sverti-\ncal dimensiond bytes; s2d the raw total count rate as a func-\ntion of stop byte for start bytes of 0\u201315 si.e., there are in\nessence 16 curves of count rate versus stop byte overplottedd;\ns3d the raw total count rate as a function of polar angle seach\nbin\u2019s start and stop byte gives a polar angle via the angle\nLUTsd; s4d integral flux scount rate divided by Gd as a func-\ntion of polar angle; s5d integral flux binned into 4\u00b0 polar\nangle bins; s6d complete all-sky image for a given head with\nazimuth angle on the vertical axis and the polar angle on the\nhorizontal axis.\nAll of the line plots are averaged over the azimuthal bins\nindicated by the yellow bar that appears to the right of each\nall-sky image. For the top three rows, the polar angle plots\nrange from \u221260\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 and are all in the \u201chead frame\u201d sin\nwhich u=0\u00b0 is perpendicular to the detector planed. In the\nbottom row, the individual heads are combined by shifting\nheads 1 and 3 by \u00b120\u00b0 with respect to head 2. In addition, the\nplots that are functions of polar angle range from \u221280\u00b0 to 80\u00b0\nin the bottom row. To reduce artifacts in the final merged\nimage, note that we do not simply merge together the three\nindividual head images. Instead, we bin the combined cor-\nrected angular distributions si.e., the processing always flows\nfrom left to right in Fig. 12sad\u2014not top to bottomd.\nAlthough the geometric factors obtained do an excellent\njob of converting counts to flux, combining data from the\nthree heads together almost always produces artifacts in the\nfinal image if additional processing is not performed. The\ntwo main reasons for this are: s1d the overall relative effi-\nciencies of the three heads may vary to some degree, and s2d\nthere may be different amounts of background noise in each\nimage. In addition, the background noise must be subtracted\nfrom the count rate, not the final fluxes. In the presence of\nbackground noise and an overall efficiency factor, the flux is\ngiven by\nJ = \u00abSC \u2212 BG D . s40d\nIn order to seamlessly merge data from the the three\nseparate heads together, we first need to determine the rela-\ntive efficiencies and the background count rates.

We determine the five unknown parameters\nusing a fitting procedure to minimize the total absolute dif-\nference sin log spaced between the fluxes that result at polar\nangles where the three heads overlap. The problem is not\nunder determined since there are five unknowns and five re-\ngions of overlap. More work needs to be done on which\nazimuth bins should be used for this fitting procedure, but the\nresults so far are quite encouraging. In addition, strong emis-\nsions tend to dominate the fit which can sometimes produce\nobvious artifacts in very low flux regions. For this reason, we\ntentatively chose to fix the background rates at 0.0 in Fig. 12.\nA projected version of the final integral flux image\nshown in Fig. 12sad is presented in Fig. 12sbd. The data are\nshown in a 360\u00b0 fish-eye projection looking toward the cen-\nter of the earth. Gaps in coverage near the poles of the all-\nsky image spolar angles approaching \u00b190\u00b0d can be seen as\ndistorted black circular regions to the left and right of the\nearth. The broad black horizontal gap connecting the poles\ncorresponds to azimuth bins for which the instrument auto-\nmatically turned off during its sweep past the sun. The bright\nregions above the sun gap are likely spurious counts due to\nsolar UV photons. The grid seen through the data is the un-\nderlying equatorial plane of the solar-magnetic sSMd coordi-\nnate system and the lines are drawn every 2 RE in both the x\nand y directions. The bright syellow, orange and redd emis-\nsions are ENAs emitted from regions quite close to the earth,\nwhile the more extended dimmer emissions sblue to cyand\nare emitted farther out from the plasma sheet. Note that in\nthis somewhat peculiar projection, the inner part of the im-\nage si.e., the circular region inside of the polesd corresponds\nto the more familiar 180\u00b0 fish-eye projection, while the ring\noutside of this corresponds to regions that are actually\n\u201cbehind us.\u201d While the mapping in the outer regions is not\nintuitively obvious sespecially near the polesd, this type of\nprojection allows us to display\/monitor all of the data avail-\nable at once without adversely distorting the view in the\nearthward direction.\nIn Fig. 13, the count rate versus angle and the integral\nflux versus angle panels are shown enlarged for six different\nevents. The contributions from each head are color coded:\nhead 1 is green; head 2 is yellow; and head 3 is blue. As can\nbe seen, in all cases the head-to-head match is excellent.\nIX.

Problems with energy binning\nIn order to determine the energy of a particle in the\nMENA instrument, we need to know: its time of flight\nsTOFd; its angle of incidence; and its mass. If we assume for\nthe moment that all of the ENAs are hydrogen, then we can\nignore the mass dependence. Then, the angle of incidence\ngives the path length, the TOF and path length give the\nspeed, and the speed and assumed mass give the energy. The\nmain problem with this scheme arises as a result of two\nseparate effects: s1d once measured, the TOF value is digi-\ntized into fairly coarse \u201cTOF bytes\u201d and s2d the mapping of\nTOF byte to energy changes as a function of polar angle\nsbecause the path length changesd.\nThese effects are illustrated in Fig. 14. The image in the\nlower left portion of the figure is an integral flux image from\nhead 2 and the two vertical arrays represent the 64 TOF byte\nvalues possible in the direct events data. The array on the left\nshows the TOF to energy mapping for a pixel at a polar angle\nof \u221240\u00b0 while the array on the right shows the TOF to energy\nmapping for a pixel at a polar angle of \u221228\u00b0. As can be seen,\nthe midpoint energy for each TOF byte is somewhat different\nfor the two pixels. The main effect of this variation is that for\na given requested energy band, a different set of TOF bytes\nwill end up getting used depending on what angle we are\nlooking at. For example, if we ask for energies between 2\nand 5 keV, the TOF bytes that will be used at \u221240\u00b0 and \u221228\u00b0\nare those that are shaded green in Fig. 14. The right-hand\nside of Fig. 14 shows the TOF bytes that would be used for\nother requested energy bands at the midpoint of the nominal\n4\u00b0 polar angle bins snote that we are not restricted to using 4\u00b0\nbinsd.\nAt this point, it is important to recognize that the DE that\nFIG. 14. sColor onlined Time-of-flight sTOFd byte to energy mapping at two different polar angles.

Note that the actual E and DE implied by these groupings of bytes is what should be used in the flux conversion formula\u2014not\nthe requested E and DE.\n043303-18 Henderson et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 76, 043303 ~2005!\nDownloaded 16 Oct 2006 to 194.80.32.10. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\nappears in Eq. s43d is not the one explicitly defined by the\nrequested energy band. Rather it is the one implicitly implied\nby the specific grouping of TOF bytes that actually get used\nat each polar angle. This is a serious problem because it\nmeans that both DE and E vary with polar angle. To illustrate\nthis more clearly, we plot DE spurple pointsd and E sgreen\npointsd as a function of polar angle in Fig. 15 together with\nthe raw count rate swhite pointsd as a function of u. In this\nplot we have not binned the data into regular polar angle bins\nwhich is why there are so many different angles represented.\nWhile the variation of E and DE is apparent in each\npanel, the most obvious and disturbing feature of this plot is\nthat for all but the 1\u20131000 keV requested energy band, E\nand DE are in fact discontinuous functions of polar angle.\nThe effect these discontinuities have on the raw count rate is\nclearly visible. Note that, even for a requested energy band\nof 1\u201360 keV, small but very noticeable discontinuities ap-\npear in the count rate data. These artifacts get much more\nsevere for the higher energy bands and\/or when the requested\nDE gets smaller si.e., when DE \/E gets smalld. Another arti-\nfact that is introduced when DE \/E becomes too small is that\ngaps begin to appear in polar angle coverage as shown in the\n20\u201325 keV panel. This occurs because DE gets so small that\nnone of the TOF-byte midpoint energies fall in the requested\nenergy range for some polar angle ranges.\nB. Solution to energy binning problems\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the way to\ncorrect for the discontinuities in the count rate data is to\nFIG. 15. sColord Variation of energy and DE as a function of polar angle and requested energy band. For a given energy band, the actual Emid sgreen pointsd\nand DE spurple pointsd will vary with polar angle. The white points are the polar angle distribution of the raw counts s210 spins of data from October 4, 2000d.\nAll quantities are plotted in arbitrary units and the scaling is different for all panels. However, to get a sense of the energy scaling, the two horizontal red lines\ndrawn on each panel indicate the requested energy range se.g., 1\u20132 keV for the upper right hand panel and 20\u201325 keV for the lower right hand paneld. Note\nthat for all but the 1\u20131000 keV case, the E and DE \u201ccurves\u201d are discontinuous functions of polar angle. This is due to the fact that different groups of\ntime-of-flight-byte bins need to be used at different polar angles. As can be seen in the raw count rate distributions, introduction of discontinuities in the data\nis the main consequence of this inconsistency. But notice also, that gaps in coverage can occur when DE \/E becomes small as is the case for the 20\u201325 keV\npanel.\n043303-19 Calculation of MENA geometric factors Rev. Sci. Instrum. 76, 043303 ~2005!\nDownloaded 16 Oct 2006 to 194.80.32.10. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\ndivide by the appropriate value of DE. The reason this does\nnot work is that while it formally results in a proper differ-\nential flux, the energy, E, at which the differential flux is\nevaluated for still changes discontinuously as a function of\npolar angle. In other words, dividing by the proper DE pro-\nduces differential flux images where each polar angle repre-\nsents a different energy. In addition, this approach does noth-\ning to avoid the introduction of gaps in polar angle. Clearly,\nin order to be able to generate uniform-energy differential\nflux images at arbitrary energies, a different approach is nec-\nessary. In this section we describe an alternative processing\nscheme that overcomes these problems and is also reason-\nably simple to implement.\nRather than trying to bin the data into pre-selected en-\nergy bands se.g., 1\u20132 keV, 2\u20135 keV, etc.d, we instead con-\nstruct a \u201cdifferential flux versus energy spectrum\u201d for each\npixel in the final image. Once this is done, the differential\nflux at any desired energy can be interpolated from these\nspectra. This approach ensures that the fluxes in each of the\npixels in the final image will be evaluated at the same energy\nand it also eliminates the gaps that were described in the\nprevious section. The task of creating differential flux images\ntherefore boils down to three distinct subproblems: s1d Cal-\nculation of the differential flux energy spectrum for a given\npixel in a given head; s2d combining the spectra together in\npixels where heads overlap, and; s3d interpolating to the de-\nsired energy.\n1. Differential flux energy spectra\nFrom Eq. s43d, we can write\nj0,ijk,tsEijktd =\nCijk,t\nGijksEijktdDEijkt\ns44d\n=\nCijk,t\nFijksEijktd\n, s45d\nwhere, FijksEijktd is the \u201cflux conversion factor\u201d sFCFd, i is\nthe start-byte index, j is the stop-byte index, k is the head ID,\n, is the azimuth bin number, and t is the TOF-byte index. As\nwe have noted above, this simple formula can be used to\nconvert raw count rate to flux provided that the true flux j\nand the geometric factor G do not change very much over the\nrange of energies considered, DE. In our case this is a rea-\nsonable approximation since G is approximately independent\nof energy above 1 keV and each TOF byte implies a fairly\nnarrow \u201cenergy aperture.\u201d\nOur algorithm for computing the differential flux versus\nenergy spectrum in a single pixel for a single head is outlined\nbelow.\n\u2022 Define the polar angle pixels. Nominally these will be\n4\u00b0 or 5\u00b0 wide, but for a given head they can be any\nreasonably small value. However, in order to properly\nmerge the final spectra for each head together into a\nsingle image, we should restrict the polar angle bin size\nto values that are multiplicative factors of 20\u00b0.\n\u2022 For a given pixel, scan through the raw direct events\nand select those that contribute to the pixel, i.e., select\nthose events that have start\/stop\/azimuth byte combina-\ntions that fall in the Du \/Df range implied by the se-\nlected pixel.\n\u2022 Convert each selected event to a differential flux using\nthe appropriate geometric factor, Gijk, and the DE im-\nplied by its TOF-byte value. Also keep track of all the\ncorresponding energies that result from this operation.\nAt this point we technically have a differential flux ver-\nsus energy spectrum in the pixel. However, in practice\nthe counting statistics will be extremely poor if we stop\nhere.\n\u2022 To build up counting statistics, we bin the differential\nfluxes into a smaller number of discrete TOF bins. One\nway to accomplish this is to average the fluxes into 64\nbins according to their TOF values. The energy that we\nassociate with each bin is then taken to be the average\nenergy of the fluxes that went into that bin. Since there\nare many TOF bins at the lower energies, each with\nvery narrow DE ranges, the counting statistics at low\nenergies can still be quite poor. Thus an alternate bin-\nning scheme in which groups of low-energy TOF bins\nare averaged together can be used instead. The latter\nbinning scheme generally yields better results.\n2. Combining spectra from different heads\nOnce the differential flux versus energy spectrum has\nbeen determined for each pixel in all three heads, we are\nready to combine the three heads together. In pixels of the\nfinal image where two heads overlap snote that there are no\npixels for which three heads ever overlapd, the two different\nenergy spectra must be merged together. One way to accom-\nplish this is to simply create a new merged spectrum from\nthe flux versus energy data points in each head sthis will\nresult in a merged spectrum with twice the data points con-\ntained in a single head spectrumd. A negative aspect of this\napproach is that it often introduces artifacts into the final\nimage because the spectrum from one head may have much\npoorer counting statistics than the other. In order to solve this\nproblem, we use a weighted average of the individual spectra\ninstead of just merging the data points. The weights are de-\ntermined by the number of counts that went into each flux\nestimate.\n3. Interpolating to the desired energy\nAfter the energy spectrum for a given pixel has been\ncomputed, the differential flux at a given energy is obtained\nby interpolation sor extrapolation if necessaryd. Several inter-\npolation methods have been implemented including: linear\ninterpolation; B-spline interpolation, Cardinal spline interpo-\nlation sjoined Bezier spline segments in which only zeroeth\nand first order derivatives are forced to be continuousd; ro-\nbust straight line fitting of nearby points swith an adjustable\nnumber of points in the fitd; Maxwellian distribution fit; and\na Kappa distribution6 fit.\nThe best results are obtained with the B-spline interpo-\nlation and the Kappa fit. For the B-spline interpolation the\ndata points sflux versus energyd are taken to be the control\npoints of the B-spline curve. Note that for this type of spline,\n043303-20 Henderson et al. Rev.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/rsi.aip.org\/rsi\/copyright.jsp\nthe interpolated curve always lies in the \u201cconvex hull\u201d of the\npiece-wise linear curve defined by the control points.7 Thus,\nthe curve is not forced to go through any of the data points\nand will never \u201cblow up.\u201d\nAn interactive graphical tool illustrating the steps out-\nlined above is shown in Fig. 16. From left to right and top to\nbottom, the six panels containing line plots show: Counts\nversus TOF byte; counts\/G versus TOF byte; differential flux\nversus TOF byte; differential flux versus re-binned TOF bins;\ndifferential flux versus energy; differential flux versus energy\nfrom re-binned TOF bins. The four panels on the right show\nthe differential flux images obtained from each head plus the\ncombined image. The line plots correspond to the pixel\nmarked with a cross hair. The differential flux images were\nevaluated at 5 keV and the interpolated value for the pixel\nunder the cross hair is shown as a larger orange square in the\nlower-right line plot. The vertical lines on the lower two\nplots are drawn at energies of s1, 2, 5, 12, 27, 40, and\n60 keVd.\nThe data shown in Fig. 16 were acquired on orbit by\nMENA over an accumulation time of 420 min between 17\nand 24 UT on October 4, 2000. Although for routine scien-\ntific analysis we would not consider using such long integra-\ntion times, here it is useful to monitor the effects of our\nprocessing without the counting noise obscuring the results.\nAlthough a few artifacts remain in the final differential flux\nimage sin the form of vertical stripesd, the overall quality of\nthe image is quite high. An additional feature that can be\nseen in the energy spectra for these long-time-average im-\nages is the possible presence of two distinct particle popula-\ntions. This can be seen in the differential flux versus energy\nplot shown in the lower left hand panel of Fig. 16. It is quite\npossible that the component appearing at lower energies\ncould be due to oxygen ENAs, although more work needs to\nbe done in order to verify this hypothesis.\nA set of differential flux images for a different event are\nshown in Fig. 17sad.

OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND FUTURE WORK\nIn the previous sections we discussed processing algo-\nrithms that we have developed for creating both integral and\ndifferential flux images from the raw MENA direct events\ndata and the example shown in Fig. 17sad clearly demon-\nstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Nevertheless, sev-\neral outstanding issues remain that we still need to address\nand we will briefly discuss them below.\nA. Scattering, point spread function, and image\ndeconvolution\nIn our calculation of the geometric factors above, we\nassumed that ENAs incident on the start foil fsee Fig. 1sddg\npass through it unperturbed on straight-line trajectories. In\nreality, the thin carbon foils used in the MENA instrument\ncan produce a significant degree of angular scattering of the\nincident ENAs. As discussed by Funsten, McComas, and\nBarraclough,9 the scattering half angle is inversely propor-\ntional to the incident particle energy\nc1\/2 =\nkF\nE\n, s46d\nwhere the \u201cfoil constant,\u201d kF depends on the incident particle\ntype se.g., H or Od, the target composition scarbon in our\ncased, and the thickness of the foil sfor MENA, the carbon\nfoils have a mass per area value of approximately\n1.1 mg\/cm2 giving a thickness of <49 \u00c5d.\nThe overall effect of the scattering in the carbon foils is\nto broaden the polar angle profiles in each head. The broad-\nening is worst at the lowest energies and improves substan-\ntially at higher energies. In addition, for a given energy,\nheavier atoms se.g., He, O, etc.d scatter much more than\nFIG. 17. sColord sad Differential flux images at eight different energies constructed from IMAGE\/MENA direct-events data acquired during a storm on June\n18, 2001. sbd An example of polar-angle \u201cblooming\u201d in an image acquired on October 14, 2000.

In order to remove this undesirable\neffect, the \u201cscattering function\u201d must be deconvolved from\nthe images in the head frame. Although simple Fourier meth-\nods for image deconvolution exist,10 it is important to recog-\nnize that they do not work well in deconvolving extended\nsources and they also rarely yield acceptable results in situ-\nations where there is significant noise present. Several de-\nconvolution methods that are more suitable for our purposes\nare discussed in Jansson\u2019s book11 and in a review article by\nStarck, Pantin, and Murtagh.12 The so-called \u201cDamped\nRichardson-Lucy\u201d algorithm is a particularly appealing can-\ndidate because: it is explicitly based on a maximum-\nlikelihood solution for Poisson statistics; it \u201cconserves en-\nergy;\u201d it ensures \u201cpositivity;\u201d it is iterative and therefore fast;\nand it is specifically designed to work with extended sources.\nWe have implemented the method and applied it to the final\nimages with some encouraging initial results sbut we note\nthat a proper implementation requires the deconvolution to\nbe done in the head frame, not the final image framed.\nB. Point spread function and polar-angle \u201cblooming\u201d\nartifacts\nPerhaps the most obvious and unnatural artifact in the\nMENA images is the \u201cpolar angle blooming\u201d effect as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 17sbd. It seems to occur when MENA is imag-\ning particularly intense low-altitude emissions from near the\nlimb of the earth at relatively oblique viewing angles si.e.,\nwhen IMAGE is not high above the poled. Under these con-\nditions, the azimuth bins affected susually only one or two of\nthemd show a broad enhancement over an anomalously wide\nrange of polar angles. This feature is indicated by an arrow in\nFig. 17sbd. Our initial, tentative interpretation of this feature\nis that it could be a result of the low-altitude ENA emissions\nhaving a significant oxygen content. Since oxygen neutral\natoms sat a given energy per amud will undergo substantially\nmore scattering in the thin carbon foil se.g., see Funsten,\nMcComas, and Barraclough9d, the signal would \u201cspread out\u201d\nmore in the imaging spolar-angled direction. Note that this\nimplies that the point spread function in the polar angle di-\nrection is likely to be species dependent as we mentioned in\nthe previous section.\nC. Sun signal contamination\nAlthough the nano-structure transmission grating used in\nthe IMAGE\/MENA heads was designed to reject UV pho-\ntons swhile at the same time transmitting ENAsd, the\nIMAGE\/MENA instrument still turns off once each 2 min\nspin period as it sweeps past the sun in order to avoid dam-\nage to the detectors from the very intense flux of solar UV\nphotons. Despite this safeguard, we have discovered that the\nMENA instrument still appears to respond to solar photons\u2014\nand in certain circumstances the peak response can occur\nwhen the instrument is not even looking directly at the sun.\nIn order to determine the source of this contamination,\nwe have computed the total projected sor \u201ceffective\u201dd area of\nsolar-illuminated surfaces upstream of the gratings scollima-\ntor plates and inner surfaces of the collimator housing struc-\ntured as a function of spin phase angle. We find that this\nprojected area is highly correlated with the polar-angle-\nsummed count rate versus spin phase. We therefore surmise\nthat the anomalous sun signal present in the data is due to\nreflection of solar UV photons from the collimator plates and\nfrom the collimator housing structure into the detector.\nA detailed calculation of these effects from first prin-\nciples would be extremely difficult and is far beyond the\nscope of the present article. Although more work needs to be\ndone in modeling the photon response, the removal of this\nartifact from the images will almost certainly be accom-\nplished with an ad hoc empirical processing scheme.\nD. Correct background subtraction\nIn counting experiments, the number of counts observed\ntypically obeys a Poisson distribution. If we have an under-\nlying count rate, r, and an observing time, T, then the ob-\nserved number of counts, n, will be Poisson-distributed as\nfollows:\npsnurd =\nsrTdn\nn!\ne\u2212rT. s47d\nHere, psn urd is the probability of getting n counts given that\nwe know that the rate has a value r. However, our problem is\nquite different from this one. We wish to infer the value of r,\ngiven that we observed n counts in the sknownd time interval,\nT. In other words, what we need to compute is psr und. This\ncan be accomplished by using Bayes\u2019 theorem which gives\nse.g., see Loredo13 and D\u2019Agostini14d the \u201cposterior distribu-\ntion\u201d\npsrund =\nTsrTdne\u2212rT\nn!\n. s48d\nThe mode smost probable value, i.e., the peak of the distri-\nbutiond, mean skrl=erpsr unddrd, and standard deviation\nskr2l\u2212 krl2d1\/2 of this distribution are: n \/T, sn+1d \/T, and\n\u02dbn+1\/T, respectively. One way to summarize the inferred\nvalue of r is to report the most probable value sthe moded\ntogether with a \u201ccredibility region\u201d containing 95% of the\nposterior density. The credibility region will in general be\nasymmetric about the mode and will never contain negative\nnumbers. Note that when n is large, the Poisson distribution\ncan be approximated by a Gaussian with mode, mean, and\nstandard deviation of: n \/T, n \/T, and \u02dbn \/T, respectively,\nwhich is consistent with the Bayesian result in the limit of\nlarge n.\nAlthough this result seems trivial swe would have cho-\nsen r=n \/T even without the Bayesian analysisd, it does allow\na more rigorous treatment of uncertainties and, as we shall\nsee, the Bayesian approach allows us to correctly deal with\nbackground subtraction. The following description of correct\nbackground subtraction is discussed much more thoroughly\nin Loredo.13\nIf we have a signal with rate s and a background with\nrate b and we do not know what either of these values are,\nthen they have to be inferred from the observed count rates.\nOne way to do this is to measure a count rate while looking\nat the \u201csignal+background\u201d and also to measure the count\nrate while looking away from the signal swhere presumably\n043303-23 Calculation of MENA geometric factors Rev.

If we collect Non counts in a time\nTon when we are looking at the signal+background and we\ncollect Noff counts in a time Toff when we are looking at just\nthe background, then it would be tempting to compute s\n=Non\/Ton\u2212Noff \/Toff as the \u201cbackground\u2212subtracted\u201d signal.\nUnfortunately, this approach is incorrect despite the fact that,\nin practice, it is the method employed almost universally.\nThe most obvious symptom that it is an incorrect prescrip-\ntion for background subtraction is that the resulting signals\ncan be negative\u2014a result that we know a priori can never\nhappen.\nThe correct approach to obtaining the signal s is via\nBayes\u2019 theorem. As described in detail by Loredo,13 applica-\ntion of Bayes\u2019 theorem to this problem leads to the following\nposterior for s\u00f80:\npssuNonId = o\n1=0\nNon\nCi\nTonssTondie\u2212sTon\ni!\ns49d\nwhere\nCi =\nS1 + ToffTonD\ni sNon + Noff \u2212 id!\nsNon \u2212 id!\no j=0\nNon S1 + ToffTonD\nj sNon + Noff \u2212 jd!\nsNon \u2212 jd!\n. s50d\nApplication of this approach to the IMAGE\/MENA data may\nresult in qualitatively \u201cbetter looking\u201d background subtracted\nimages. And it may also be quantitatively important in ENA\ninversion schemes as well as the possible extraction of weak\nsignals such as one might expect from the heliospheric ENA\nemissions or weak down-tail magnetospheric emissions.\nE. MCP design considerations\nAs we have seen, the inherent mismatch between the\nrequested DE and the actual DE combined with the polar-\nangle-dependent TOF byte to energy mapping, results in se-\nvere artifacts in the differential flux images. We note that this\nwould not have occurred if the TOF-byte-to-energy map-\npings were fixed si.e., not angle dependentd\u2014we would then\njust use the \u201cnatural\u201d E and DE values implied by the appro-\npriate TOF-byte groupings. This could have been achieved\nwith a curved MCP\/anode detector since the path length\nwould then be constant. Thus, it may be appropriate to con-\nsider adopting a cylindrically curved MCP stack in future\nversions of the MENA instrument.\n1 C. J. Pollock, K. Asamura, J. Baldonado, M. M. Balkey, P.
