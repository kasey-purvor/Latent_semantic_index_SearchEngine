This study investigated the effect of oropharyngeal geometry on inhaled aerosol \ncharacteristics via pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), both with or without spacers.   \nMethods. Seven adult oropharyngeal models with different centreline lengths, total volumes, \nand degree of constrictions were employed as induction ports for a laser diffraction particle \nsize analyser and cascade impactor. Particle size change over time, mass median aerodynamic \ndiameter (MMAD), average median volume diameter (DV50), inhaled doses, and \noropharyngeal depositions (percentage of the nominal dose) for aerosols via suspension and \nultrafine pMDIs with or without spacers at 30 l\/min airflow were determined.   \nResults. Variations in oropharyngeal geometry caused significant variations in inhaled \nparticle size distributions, doses, oropharyngeal drug depositions, and particle size change \nover time when pMDIs were used without spacers.  However, inhaled aerosol characteristics \nhad marginal variations for the ultrafine pMDI plus large volume spacer (MMAD range: \n0.69-0.78 \u00b5m, DV50 range: 1.27-1.36 \u00b5m, inhaled dose range: 46.46-52.92%).  It was found \nthat the amounts of inhaled aerosol particles with aerodynamic size of less than 0.83 \u00b5m via \npMDIs plus large volume spacer were slightly affected by the oropharyngeal geometry.   \nConclusion. Inhaling ultrafine aerosols via spacers may reduce the effect of oropharyngeal \ngeometry on inhaled aerosol properties. \n \nKey Words: Pressurised Metered Dose Inhalers; Ultrafine aerosols; Inter-subject inhaled \ndose variability; oropharyngeal models; acute asthma exacerbations  \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nPulmonary drug delivery has been employed not only for treatment of respiratory \ndiseases, such as asthma, but also delivery of peptides such as insulin for systemic effects and \nvaccines for immunization [1].  Amongst the inhalers, pressurised metered dose inhalers \n(pMDIs) are used extensively by patients due to their portability, low airflow resistance, and \ngeneration of suitable aerosols independent of patient inspiratory flow rate.  The presence of \nthese properties has resulted in using pMDIs (with spacers) as first line drug delivery device \nin treatment of acute asthma exacerbations [2,3].  However, a subgroup of patients has been \nidentified who had poor responses to inhaled drugs (corticosteroids and bronchodilators) via \nthese devices [2,4], which could not be attributed to the poor inhalation technique, as pMDIs \nwere used with spacers.  To achieve goals of therapy in these patients, increasing the drug \ndose was considered, but this resulted in increased drug systemic side effects [4], or the \npatients were required intense monitoring and hospitalisation [2].  Furthermore, it has been \nshown that variability in oropharyngeal drug deposition caused variability in amounts of drug \nreaching the lungs via inhalers [5-8], and consequently resulted in variable clinical responses \n[5].  Therefore, these observations suggest that reduction in the amount of drug reaching the \nlungs could have played an important role for poor responses to the inhalation therapy. \nAttempts have been made to reduce the oropharyngeal drug deposition by increasing \ninhaler airflow resistance [8], and elongating the inhaler mouthpiece [9].  However, these \napproaches were not successful.  This is because inhalers with a high airflow resistance were \nnot suitable for young children and the elderly patients [10].  Furthermore, elongating inhaler \nmouthpiece was not sufficient to reduce significantly oropharyngeal drug deposition \ncompared to the normal oropharyngeal drug depositions [9].  In fact, recent studies using \noropharyngeal models have indicated that differences in the oropharyngeal geometries would \ncause variation in the amounts of drug delivered to the lungs via conventional suspension \n 4 \npMDIs with or without spacers [11,12].  However, ultrafine pMDIs (devices that generate \naerosols with mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 1 \u00b5m) which have markedly \ndifferent aerosol performance compared to conventional suspension pMDIs [13,14] have not \nbeen investigated.   \nThe primary goal of this study was to compare an ultrafine pMDI with a suspension \npMDI with regard to the effect of oropharyngeal geometry on the inhaled aerosol particle size, \nparticle size time profile, dose, and oropharyngeal drug deposition.  In this study \nphysiologically faithful oropharyngeal models were employed and spacers with different \nsizes were considered.  A corticosteroid inhaler and a bronchodilator inhaler which are \ncommonly used in treatment of acute asthma exacerbations were chosen.  The secondary goal \nof this study was to estimate aerodynamic particle size, which would make the inhaled dose \nrelatively independent of the oropharyngeal geometry. \n \nMaterial \nBrij\u00ae35 (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether) and beclometasone dipropionate were \npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany).  Glycerol was \nobtained from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Poole, England), salbutamol sulphate micronised \npowder was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline (Ware, UK), Decan 90 detergent solution was \nobtained from Decan Laboratories Ltd (Sussex, UK), and HPLC grade methanol was \npurchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK).  Salbutamol sulphate suspension \npMDI (Ventolin\u2122 Evohaler\u2122 ,GlaxoSmithKline Ltd, London, UK, 100 \u00b5g per actuation), \nand beclometasone dipropionate solution pMDI (Qvar\u2122 ,Ivax Pharmaceuticals, London, UK, \n50 \u00b5g per actuation) were employed.  \n \n \n 5 \nMethods  \n \nThe Oropharyngeal Models and Add-on Spacers \nThree-dimensional reconstructions of the mouth and throat of healthy adult subjects \ninhaling at 30 l\/min via the Bricanyl pMDI (AstraZeneca, Kings Langley, UK) and \nNebuChamber mouthpiece (AstraZeneca, Kings Langley, UK) were considered.  These data \nwere obtained in a previous study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [15].  The \nsubjects\u2019 age range was 23-35 years.  In total, seven three-dimensional reconstructions were \nemployed.  For the purpose of this study, oropharyngeal shapes with different centreline \nlengths and configurations were used.  The oropharyngeal geometries were ranked between 1 \nand 7 according to their volumes (by rank 1 being the smallest volume and 7 the largest one).  \nAlso, similar to a previous study\n \n[8], the oropharyngeal configurations were categorised into \n3 groups.  The grouping was based on the severity of the airway narrowing (due to the \noropharyngeal posture) in the oropharynx section of the throat.  The groups were: \nA. Wide open space \nB. Moderate narrowing  \nC. Marked constriction.  \nFigure 1A illustrates the three dimensional surface rendering of the reconstructed mouths \nand throats, their midsagittal sections, and designations (1C, 2C, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6B, 7B).  \nFigure 1B depicts a typical head and neck MRI image illustrating the centreline in the mouth \nand throat, and the region of the airway (starting from the back of the upper lip to 2 cm below \nthe vocal cords) that was considered to calculate the oropharyngeal volume.  The midsagittal \nhead and neck MRI images of the subjects, and cross sectional areas of the oropharyngeal \nreconstructions (along the centreline) are provided as on-line supplementary material.  Table \n1 presents the oropharyngeal lengths, volumes, and their designations.  The oropharyngeal \n 6 \nplastic (acrylnitrile-butadiene-styrene) models were prepared according to the previously \nreported method [16].  The 1C, 2C, 3A, and 5A models were employed in previous studies \n[12, 16].  The inhalers were tested in this study had low airflow resistances similar to those \nthat were used in the MRI study [15]; and also similar inspiratory airflow rates via the \ninhalers were employed.  Furthermore, the circular shape and cross sectional diameter of the \nQvar mouthpiece were similar to the shape and dimensions of the oral cavity inlets of 2C, 4A, \n5A, and 6B models.  Similarly, the rectangular shape and cross sectional diameter of the \nVentolin Evohaler mouthpiece were comparable with shape and dimensions of the oral cavity \ninlets of 1C, 3A, and 7B models.  Therefore, marked differences in the oropharyngeal \ngeometries due to switching from the original inhalers that were used in the MRI study [15] \nto those that were employed in this study were not expected.   \nThe AeroTrach Plus\u2122 spacer (Trudell Medical International) was used as a large valved \nholding chamber (large volume spacer, 149 ml space volume).  In addition, the Optimiser \n(Norton Healthcare and Glaxo-SmithKline Ltd, Harlow, UK,) was used with the Ventolin as \nsmall volume spacer.  Furthermore, a high-density polyethylene tube with 2 cm internal \ndiameter (2.2 cm outer diameter) and 8 cm length (denoted as \u201clong tube\u201d) was used with the \nQvar.  To reduce the electrostatic charge in the spacers, these were soaked for 2 hours in 2% \n(w\/v) Decan 90 solution and left to drip-dry. \nThe following inhaler devices were employed: the Qvar, Qvar with the large volume \nspacer, Qvar with the long tube, and Ventolin with the large volume spacer which had \ncircular mouthpieces; and therefore these were used with the 2C, 4A, 5A, and 6B \noropharyngeal models (which also had circular cross section at the inlet of the oral cavity part \nand diameter similar to the inhalers\u2019 mouthpieces).  Combinations of the Ventolin pMDI with \nor without the Optimiser had rectangular mouthpiece shape; and therefore these were used \nwith 1C, 3A, and 7B models (which also had rectangular cross section at the inlet of the oral \n 7 \ncavity part and diameter similar to the inhalers\u2019 mouthpieces).  In this study it was possible to \nmatch commercially available ultrafine pMDI (the Qvar with circular mouthpiece) with the \noropharyngeal models that also had circular oral cavity inlet.  The rectangular mouthpiece of \nbronchodilator suspension pMDI necessitated using oropharyngeal models with rectangular \noral cavity inlets.  The matching of the inhalers with the corresponding oropharyngeal models \nwas performed to ensure suitable connections between the inhalers and models.  However, by \nconsidering employed airflow rate (30 l\/min) and aerosol particle diameter (mostly less than \n3\u00b5m) in this study, based on a previous work, a considerable change in the oropharyngeal \ndrug deposition due to variations in the mouthpiece diameter and shape was not expected [17]. \n \nLaser Diffraction Particle Size Measurements \nA Sympatec HELOS BF\/MAGIC\n\u00ae\n system (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, \nGermany) equipped with a modular inhaler adapter (INHALER\n\u00ae\n 2000) and R2 lens (size \nrange from 0.25\u201387.5 m) was used to obtain laser diffraction angles and intensities.  The \nFraunhofer model operated within the WINDOX 5 software was employed to calculate the \nparticle size distributions of the samples.  Aerosols were directed to the inhaler module either \nvia an oropharyngeal model (connected to the inlet of the inhaler module from its upper \ntrachea part) or by directly connecting the inhaler device to the instrument.  In this study the \ncounter flow was not used.  However, the windows that the laser beam passed through were \ncleaned regularly.   \nTo deliver aerosols to an oropharyngeal model, a pMDI with or without a spacer was \nconnected to the oral cavity part of the corresponding model and sealed using flexible \nParafilm M.  Then the airflow through the inhaler device and oropharyngeal model was set to \n30 l\/min and the device was actuated once.  When the suspension pMDI was evaluated, the \ndevice was shaken before each actuation.  The particle size measurements were performed at \n 8 \n1 ms time slices with trigger conditions of either optical concentration greater than 0.3%, or \nreal time duration of 0.2 seconds.  As the duration of aerosol delivery via an inhaler with or \nwithout attaching to a model had a distribution, for simplicity, general trends are reported in \nthis study.  The airflow rate was set at 14 l\/min when pMDIs were used with the large volume \nspacer and connected directly to the inhaler module (without using any oropharyngeal model).  \nThis allowed obtaining suitable number of sample data points.  Based on a previous study, \nmarked differences in the aerosol performances of the pMDIs used with the large volume \nspacer (reduced electrostatic charge) caused by switching the airflow rate from 30 l\/min to 14 \nl\/min were not expected [18].  Prior to each experiment, the oropharyngeal models were \nwetted with a solution of 0.7 g Brij 35 in 100 ml of glycerol to simulate the wet mucosa that \nnaturally occurs in the throat. \nThe particle size distributions were compared statistically by the average median \nvolume diameter Dv50, defined as 50% of the cumulative volume undersize (this parameter \nwas indicated as X50 by the manufacturer).  The relative span, (Dv90-Dv10)\/Dv50, for each \nparticle size distribution was calculated to present the dispersity of the distribution.  Particle \nsize measurements for each experimental setting were replicated six times.   \n \nAerodynamic Particle Size Measurements \nThe oropharyngeal models using suitable adaptors were connected to the Next \nGeneration Impactor (Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK).  Then, a glass microfibre filter at \nthe outlet of the impactor was used to capture particles that were not collected by the \nimpactor.  A high capacity pump (Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK) was used to draw air \nthrough the oropharyngeal models and impactor at 30 l\/min.  Based on previously published \ndata, the impactor plates were not coated with any adhesive agents [19].  An inhaler device \n(pMDI with or without attaching to a spacer) was connected to the oral cavity of the \n 9 \nrespective model and the connection was sealed using Parafilm M flexible film.  When the \nrequired airflow through the device and model was established, the pMDI was actuated once \nand the airflow rate was maintained for 8 seconds.  The suspension pMDI was shaken before \neach actuation.  For each particle size measurement, the pMDIs were actuated 10 times.  \nThen, the oropharyngeal model, spacer, impactor cups, and filter were washed with either \ndistilled water for the salbutamol pMDI, or methanol\/water mixture (70\/30% v\/v) for the \nbeclometasone dipropionate pMDI.  The amount of deposited drug in each section was \ndetermined using spectrophotometric analysis at 276 nm for salbutamol sulphate and 239 nm \nfor beclometasone dipropionate from the relevant standard curves.  Drug depositions within \nthe impactor or oropharyngeal models are reported as percentage of nominal dose via the \npMDIs.  Oropharyngeal models before each aerosol deposition experiment were wetted by \nthe corresponding washing solution to simulate the wet condition in the mouth and throat. \nSince the oropharyngeal models were considered as the induction port for the \nimpactor, then total amount of drug deposited in the impactor and attached filter was \nconsidered as the inhaled dose.  The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of aerosol \nparticles for each experimental setting was calculated by plotting cumulative percentage of \nmass less than stated aerodynamic diameter (probability scale) versus aerodynamic diameter \n(log scale).  Each deposition study was replicated six times.  The experiments were \nperformed at the local ambient conditions (typically 20\u00baC temperature and 70% relative \nhumidity).  In the Result section the Qvar pMDI is referred as the ultrafine pMDI, and the \nVentolin Evohaler pMDI as the suspension pMDI.   \n \nStatistical Analysis  \nKruskal\u2013Wallis tests followed by two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests for all cases were \nconducted.  Then, by considering total number of comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was \n 10 \napplied to the  level.  Therefore, as the number of comparisons was 6 for each experimental \nsetting in the group of 2C, 4A, 5A, and 6B models, the significance level for this group was \nconsidered as P < 0.008.  Similarly, since the number of comparisons was 3 for each \nexperimental setting in the group of 1C, 3A, and 7B models, the significance level was set as \nP < 0.016.  \n 11 \nResults  \nParticle Size Analysis \nLaser Diffraction  \nFigure 2 presents cumulative volume percent size distribution curves of aerosol \nparticles at the exit of oropharyngeal models via the inhalers.  In the figures, representative \nparticle size distributions via the inhalers without using an oropharyngeal model are also \nplotted.  It can be seen that particle size distributions were affected considerably by the \noropharyngeal geometry when pMDIs were used alone (Figures 2A and 2B), or the \nsuspension pMDI with spacers (Figures 2C and 2D).  When the large volume spacer was used \nwith the ultrafine pMDI, the deviation from the original particle size distribution was minimal \n(Figure 2E).   \nFigure 3 illustrates particle size distribution parameters, DV10, DV50, DV90, and span \nchanges over time.  It can be seen that when the oropharyngeal models were used with \npMDIs only (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C), duration of aerosol delivery was longer for the \nultrafine pMDI than the suspension formulation.  This may be explained due to entrapping of \nultrafine aerosol particles in air recirculations (within the models) for a longer time than \nlarger aerosol particles via the suspension formulation.  Also, within each formulation, the \nduration of aerosol delivery was increased by increasing the oropharyngeal volume.  \nFurthermore, all particle size distribution parameters changed significantly over time for \nmodels that had constrictions in the oral cavity (the 1C, 2C, 6B, and 7B models).  Taking \npMDI formulation into account, decrease in particle size was more significant for the \nultrafine pMDI (contained alcohol) than the suspension formulation. \nThe emission of aerosols with relatively constant particle size distribution via the \noropharyngeal models with wide openings in the oral cavity (the 4A and 5A models in \nFigures 3A and 3B) by using the ultrafine pMDI may be explained by rapid ventilation of the \n 12 \nmodels and consequently faster evaporation of the propellant and excipient.  However, a \nrelatively steady state situation in particle size was observed around 2 seconds after actuation \nfor models with large oropharyngeal volumes (the 5A and 6B models).  Particle size change \nover time for pMDIs without connecting to the models did not follow the above patterns (data \nnot shown).   \nUsing the large volume spacer plus pMDIs alleviated particle size change over time \nfor Dv50 (Figure 3F) and Dv90 (Figure 3G), but not for Dv10 (Figure 3E) values for aerosols \nthat pass through the models.  Similar trends (Figures 3E-3G) were also observed for aerosols \nvia the pMDIs plus the large volume spacer only (without connecting to models).  It can be \nseen from Figure 3E that for these aerosols Dv10 values initially increased then decreased.  \nThis may be due to saturation of the laser measuring chamber with the propellant and \nexcipient; and consequently delaying evaporation of aerosol particles.  Similarly, gradual \nevaporation of propellants and excipients from the aerosol particles within the models might \ncause a gradual decline in particle size when the models were employed.   \nThe average volume median diameters (Dv50) of the aerosol particles via the pMDIs \nwith or without spacers are illustrated in Figure 4A.  In this figure data are presented as \nascending oropharyngeal volume on the x-axis.  It can be seen from using the ultrafine pMDI \nwithout a spacer Dv50 decreases significantly from 1.24  0.09 m to 0.82  0 .01 m as the \noropharyngeal volume increases from 53.4 to 68.4 cm\n3\n (oropharyngeal models: 2C, 4A, and \n5A).  However, average Dv50 increases significantly to 1.10  0.13 m despite increasing the \noropharyngeal volume (75.1 cm\n3\n) for the 6B model.  A similar trend in average Dv50, but \nwith less severity can also be seen for the ultrafine pMDI that was used with the long tube.  \nThis observation may be explained by referring to Figures 3A to 3C indicating that the \npresence of constrictions in the oral cavity might delay evaporation of the propellant and \n 13 \nexcipient, which resulted in initial larger aerosol particles emitting from the model; and this \nincreased the average value of Dv50.   \nUsing the ultrafine pMDI with the large volume spacer increased average Dv50 \ncompared to the ultrafine pMDI without using the spacers (Figure 4A), but the variability of \nthese values between the oropharyngeal models decreased (1.27  0.06 m to 1.36  0.13 \nm).  In contrast, average Dv50 changed considerably for the suspension pMDI (with or \nwithout spacers) as a function of total oropharyngeal volume and presence of constrictions in \nthe oral cavity (Figure 4A).   \n \nAerodynamic Particle Size  \nCumulative mass aerodynamic distribution curves for aerosol particles that passed \nthrough the models via the inhalers are illustrated in Figure 5.  A clear effect of \noropharyngeal geometry on the distribution curves can be seen when pMDIs used without \nspacers (Figure 5A for the ultrafine pMDI, and 5C for the suspension pMDI).  Using the large \nvolume spacer (Figure 5B and 5C) or the small volume spacer with the suspension \nformulation (Figure 5E) reduced the effect of oropharyngeal geometry on aerodynamic \nparticle size distributions (at least up to 90% cumulative mass).  The data in Figure 5 also \nshow a non-linear relationship between cumulative mass under size and aerodynamic particle \nsize in the probability-log scale, for aerosols that passed through the models, in particular for \nthe ultrafine pMDI.   \nParticle deposition distributions within the impactor for the pMDIs used with the large \nvolume spacer are illustrated in Figure 6 (Figure 6A for the ultrafine pMDI and 6B for the \nsuspension pMDI).  It can be seen that amount of inhaled aerosol particles with aerodynamic \ndiameter less than 0.83 m (stage 7, MOC and filter) became relatively independent of the \noropharyngeal geometry.   \n 14 \nEstimated mass median aerodynamic particle diameters for aerosols via the inhalers \nattached to the models are presented in Figure 4B.  Significant differences between MMAD \nvalues were found for the ultrafine pMDI without spacer (MMAD range: 0.41  0.04 m to \n0.61  0.04 m, P < 0.008), salbutamol pMDI with the large volume spacer (MMAD range: \n1.86  0.18 to 2.05  0.13 m P < 0.008), and salbutamol pMDI with the small volume \nspacer (MMAD range: 1.86 \u00b1 0.07 m to 2.05 \u00b1 0.04 m, P<0.016).  However, the \ndifferences in MMAD values of the models for the salbutamol without spacer, despite the \nlarge variations, did not reach the significance level (range: 1.73 \u00b1 0.12 m to 1.85 \u00b1 0.13 \nm).  On the other hand, using the ultrafine pMDI with the large volume spacer resulted in \nless variation in the MMAD values (MMAD range: 0.69 \u00b1 0.03 m to 0.78 \u00b1 0.02 m) with \nno significant differences amongst those.   \n \nInhaled Dose and Oropharyngeal Drug Deposition  \nThe inhaled doses and oropharyngeal drug depositions, as percentage of the nominal \ndose, via the pMDIs with or without spacers are shown in Figure 7.  In this figure data are \npresented as ascending oropharyngeal volume on the x-axis.  A\n \ngeneral positive correlation \ncan be seen between volume of the oropharyngeal model and inhaled dose (Figure 7A) for \nthe ultrafine pMDI without spacer (15.99 \u00b1 4.95% to 42.50 \u00b1 3.68%), and salbutamol pMDI \nwith or without spacers.  Statistical analysis showed significant differences amongst those \nvalues.  However, inhaled doses for the ultrafine pMDI with the large volume spacer despite \na small increase (46.46 \u00b1 2.77% to 52.92 \u00b1 4.92%) were relatively independent of the \noropharyngeal geometry and showed no significant differences amongst the models.  Data in \nFigure 7A also indicate that inhaled doses via the suspension pMDI plus the large volume \nspacer were comparable with those through the small volume spacer. \n 15 \nIncreasing oropharyngeal volume reduced oropharyngeal drug deposition for the \nultrafine pMDI with or without the large volume spacer, and suspension pMDI with the large \nvolume spacer (Figure 7B).  However, oropharyngeal drug depositions via the suspension \npMDI with or without the small volume spacer were dependent on the oropharyngeal volume \nand presence of constrictions within the airway.  Drug deposition, as percentage of the \nnominal dose, within the large volume spacer was 14.94 \u00b1 1.32% for the ultrafine pMDI, and \n64.79 \u00b1 4.35% for the suspension pMDI. \n \n \n 16 \nDiscussion  \nThe results of this study suggest that inhaled doses of aerosol particles with \naerodynamic size less than 0.83 \u00b5m from large volume spacers at rate of 30 l\/min would not \nbe affected significantly by the oropharyngeal geometry.  Also, the presence of constrictions \nin the oral cavity may affect evaporation rate of aerosol particles via pMDIs.   \nTreatment with high and repeated doses of brochodilators and corticosteroids in \nmanagement of acute asthma exacerbations have been indicated in the literature [20,21].  \nDelivering high and less variable inhaled doses of these drugs would be crucial in an \neffective treatment of acute asthma exacerbations.  Therefore, based on the results of this \nstudy, to achieve high and less variable lung doses, development of ultrafine or \nnanosuspension pMDI formulations should be expanded [22,23]. \nThe results of this study further demonstrate that although ultrafine pMDIs may \nproduce aerosol particles with MMAD of 1 \u00b5m [14], time and space should be given for \nevaporation of propellant and cosolvent from the initial generated aerosol particles.  Then the \ninhaled dose may become independent of oropharyngeal geometry. It should be noted that in \nthis study the ambient conditions (humidity and temperature) were used for the inhaled air.  \nWhereas the results of this study may not be valid if air with high level of humidity is inhaled \nwhich may increase the size of inhaled particles [24].  Furthermore, as particle size may \nchange due to hygroscopic growth in the lungs [25], then depending on the change in the \nparticle size, despite the similarity of inhaled doses, the same regions of the lungs may not be \ntargeted [26]. \nThe results of this study agree well with a previous in vitro study showing a negative \ncorrelation between total oropharyngeal volume and aerosol deposition in the throat via a \nsuspension pMDI [11].  In addition, the current study shows that the presence of constrictions \nshould be considered.  Since smaller throats with wide openings in the airway may result in \n 17 \nsimilar aerosol depositions as do larger throats but with constrictions.  Furthermore, the \nrelationship between the total oropharyngeal volume and inhaled dose, or oropharyngeal drug \ndeposition may be eliminated if ultrafine aerosols are inhaled via a large volume spacer at 30 \nl\/min.   \nDespite the important role of corticosteroids in management of acute asthma \nexacerbations, a study has found no benefit of doubling inhaled corticosteroid amounts in the \nmanagement plan [27].  This observation may be partly explained by the results of this study \nthat as the inhalers in the above study were suspension pMDIs, then the inhaled doses might \nhave been extensively affected by the oropharyngeal geometry and posture.   \nThe results of this study regarding variation in the oropharyngeal aerosol deposition \nvia pMDIs may be applicable to adult subjects with stable asthma, as differences in \noropharyngeal aerosol depositions between these asthmatic and healthy adult subjects have \nnot been shown before [28].  However, it should be noted that the oropharyngeal models \nemployed in this study were based on healthy adult subjects.  This may not completely \nrepresent patients with acute asthma exercitations.  As it seems impossible to determine the \noropharyngeal configurations of these patients using conventional methods such as MRI, then \nit was anticipated that employing oropharyngeal models with different configurations would \nillustrate the possible range of oropharyngeal geometries that may occur in these patients.  \nAdditionally, it may be argued that elements other than suitable particle size distribution and \ndose of aerosols are required in an effective treatment of acute asthma exacerbations.  \nTherefore, clinical studies will be required to establish the results of the current study.   \nThe results of this study are also in good agreement with data from clinical studies \nshowing large intra-subject and inter-subject variations of lung doses for aerosol particles \nwith MMAD > 2 m [29-32].  In addition, the results of this study agree with the data of a \nclinical study showing high lung doses (approximately 58% of the ex-actuator dose) with \n 18 \nlittle variability via the Qvar with a large volume spacer in children aged 5 to 17 years old \n[33].  Age dependent drug lung deposition via a suspension pMDI plus spacer has shown \nbefore [34].  \nAnother limitation of this study is comparing the aerosol performances of two pMDI \nformulations with different actuator designs.  As it has been shown that the actuator design \nsuch as the orifice size could have effect on the plume geometry [35], then the results of this \nstudy may not be valid if significant changes are applied to the actuators or formulations of \nemployed pMDIs.  \nIn conclusion, the present study suggests that delivery of aerosol particles with \nMMAD less than 0.83 m to the lungs via large volume spacers at 30 l\/min inhalation flow \nrate would not be affected significantly by the variations in the oropharyngeal geometry.  The \nresults of this study are in good agreement with clinical data.  Therefore, in formulation of \npMDIs, ability of a product to generate ultrafine aerosol particles may be considered an \nimportant feature when fast and precise amount of inhaled drug is necessary.   \n \nAcknowledgment  \nWe would like to take this opportunity and express our gratitude to Sympatec Ltd, \nWaterfold House, Bury, BL9 7BR for providing use of the Sympatec HELOS BF\/MAGIC\n\u00ae\n \nsystem with the Inhaler 2000 module to perform this study.
