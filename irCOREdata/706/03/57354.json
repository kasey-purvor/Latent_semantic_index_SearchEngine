It is part of the Andean basement that outcrops both as discontinuous inliers50\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nthroughout the belt and in uplifted blocks in the Andean foreland, from as far north as51\nVenezuela to as far south as the Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina (see Rapela et al., this 52\nvolume). Metamorphic rocks of the Arequipa Massif are mostly metasedimentary and range 53\nfrom amphibolite to granulite facies. Pervasive retrogression under greenschist facies was54\nfocused within late strongly sheared zones.  Early dating of granulites between Caman\u00e1 and 55\nMollendo (Fig. 1) by Rb-Sr (whole-rock isochrons) and U-Pb (bulk dating of zircons) first 56\nresulted in Precambrian ages of ca 1.8\u20131.95 Ga (Cobbing et al., 1977; Dalmayrac et al., 1977; 57\nShackleton et al., 1979). Regional metamorphism in the Arequipa Massif according to these 58\nauthors resulted from a single Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal event; the age of sedimentary 59\nprotoliths was estimated at ca. 2000 Ma. Emplacement of plutons and metamorphic 60\nreworking under low-grade conditions took place in the Paleozoic at ca. 450 Ma and ca. 390 61\nMa (Shackleton et al., 1979).62\n63\nPaleogeographic models of Proterozoic continents as developed in the 1990s led to a 64\nrenewed interest in the study of the Arequipa Massif. According to these models most 65\ncontinental masses reunited into a large supercontinent called Rodinia by the end of the 66\nMesoproterozoic as a result of the Grenvillian orogeny (e.g. Moores, 1991; Hoffman, 1991; 67\nDalziel, 1997). In these models, and in more recent paleogeographical reconstructions, the 68\nAmazonia craton figures juxtaposed to Laurentia, i.e., the ancestral North America craton, at69\nca. 1.0 Ga, although their relative positions vary from one to another (e.g., Dalziel, 1997; 70\nDavidson, 1995; Loewy et al., 2003; Tohver et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008). Amazonia broke 71\naway from Laurentia in the Neoproterozoic, leading to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean and 72\nthe intervening Grenvillian orogen broke into conjugate belts along the margins of the rifted 73\ncontinents. Because Grenvillian ages were known from elsewhere in South America, lending74\ncredence to the Laurentia - Amazonia connection in this way, the age, paleogeography and75\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \ntectonics of the Arequipa Massif became the subject of thorough isotope (Nd and Pb) and76\nrenewed geochronological research (Wasteneys et al., 1995; Tosdal, 1996; Bock et al., 2000; 77\nLoewy et al., 2003, 2004). 78\n79\nU-Pb single-grain zircon dating of granulites yielded Grenvillian ages of ca. 1200 Ma near 80\nQuilca, and ca 970 Ma near Mollendo for the high-grade metamorphism, with protolith ages 81\nof ca. 1.9 Ga (Wasteneys et al., 1995). The age of regional metamorphism in the Arequipa 82\nMassif thus switched from Paleoproterozoic to Late Mesoproterozoic and the massif was re-83\ninterpreted as having originated within the Grenville province. Further conventional zircon U-84\nPb dating was carried out by Loewy et al. (2004) on igneous gneisses of the San Ju\u00e1n and 85\nMollendo areas. They inferred a complex history of crystallization of protoliths between 1851 86\nand 1818 Ma, and at ca. 1790 Ma, with development of an earlier gneissic fabric prior to the 87\nlatter (M1 metamorphism). Mesoproterozoic metamorphism (M2) took place between ca.88\n1052 Ma at San Ju\u00e1n and 935 Ma near Mollendo, suggesting a north-to-south younging of the 89\nmetamorphic peak. A retrograde metamorphic overprint (M3) and conspicuous granite 90\nmagmatism took place in the Ordovician at ca. 465 Ma (Loewy et al., 2003). Martignole and 91\nMartelat (2003) focused on the structure, geochronology and mineralogy of the high-grade92\nmetamorphism between Caman\u00e1 and Mollendo, which they classified as of the UHT type 93\n(T>900 \u00baC; 1.0\u20131.3 GPa) on account of ubiquitous peak assemblages with 94\northopyroxene+sillimanite+quartz and the local coexistence of sapphirine+quartz. Dating this 95\nmetamorphism was attempted by in situ chemical (CHIME) U-Th-Pb determinations on 96\nmonazites; the calculated ages range from 1064 to 956 (\u00b150) Ma, with a peak ca. 1.0 Ga.97\n98\nThe Arequipa Massif has long been considered to be the northern exposure of a larger99\nhypothetical continental block that outcrops as basement inliers within the Andean Cordillera100\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nin northern Chile and northern Argentina, i.e., the composite Arequipa-Antofalla craton 101\n(Ramos, 1988). This block includes a Grenvillian basement and post-Grenvillian 102\nmetamorphic and igneous overprints as young as 0.4 Ga (Loewy et al., 2003). Isotope (Nd 103\nand Pb) and geochronological considerations led Casquet et al. (2008) to establish 104\ncomparisons between Grenvillian terranes recognized in the Western Sierras Pampeanas, i.e., 105\nthe Andean foreland, and the Arequipa Massif, thus enlarging the boundaries of the Arequipa-106\nAntofalla block. However, both the role of the Arequipa Massif in the Grenvillian orogeny 107\nand its pre-Grenvillian history are still poorly known. Wasteneys et al. (1995) were the first to 108\npropose that the Arequipa Massif was a promontory of Laurentia accreted to Amazon\u00eda 109\nduring the Suns\u00e1s orogeny, a Late Mesoproterozoic Grenvillian-age tectonic event long 110\nrecognized along the SW margin of Amazon\u00eda, in Brasil and SE Bolivia (Litherland et al., 111\n1989; Cordani and Teixeira, 2007). According to Wasteneys et al. (1995) granulite 112\nmetamorphism resulted from pre-collisional subcontinental mantle delamination coeval with 113\nflat subduction, and concomitant rise of the hot asthenosphere that heated the overlying 114\ncontinental crust (see also Martignole and Martelat, 2003). However, for Loewy et al. (2004)115\nthe Arequipa-Antofalla block was an orphaned block, accreted to Amazonia during the 116\nSuns\u00e1s orogeny at ca. 1.05 Ga.   117\n118\nIt is now widely accepted that the Grenvillian orogenic cycle played an important role in 119\nCentral Andean South America as evidenced by the Arequipa Massif and the Western Sierras 120\nPampeanas. Moreover Grenvillian-age rocks have long been recognized in the basement of121\nthe Northern Andes (e.g., Restrepo Pace et al., 1997) and along the southern margin of the 122\nAmazonia craton (Cordani and Teixeira, 2007). However the pre-Grenvillian history and the 123\ntime and mode of accretion of the Grenvillian terranes to nearby Amazonia, and correlations 124\nwith the alleged Laurentian conjugate margin, still remain speculative.   125\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n126\nThis contribution is aimed at better constraining the igneous and metamorphic history of 127\nthe Arequipa Massif by means of new U-Pb SHRIMP determinations and complementary 128\ngeochemical evidence. We conclude that the massif was the site of a complex history that129\nconsisted of sedimentation, magmatism and metamorphism (UHT) in the Paleoproterozoic, 130\ndevelopment of a sedimentary basin in the Mesoproterozoic, Grenville-age medium- to high-131\ngrade metamorphism, and local metamorphic reworking and magmatism in the Early 132\nPaleozoic.133\n134\nGeological setting135\n136\nThe most comprehensive geological description of the Arequipa Massif is that of137\nShackleton et al. (1979). We retain here some of the domains that they distinguished to better 138\nlocate our samples. A summarized description follows based on their work and our own 139\nobservations.140\n141\nThe northern section 142\n143\nThe San Ju\u00e1n Marcona area in the north (Fig. 1) consists of a basement and a discordant 144\ncover sequence. The latter is formed by glacial diamictites of the Chiquerio Formation 145\nfollowed by a carbonate cap, the San Ju\u00e1n Formation, both probably Neoproterozoic (Chew et 146\nal., 2007). The basement consists of banded migmatitic gneisses and minor fine-grained 147\ngneisses, strongly dismembered concordant pegmatites, concordant and discordant 148\namphibolite dykes, and a foliated megacrystic granite of ca. 1790 Ma (Loewy et al., 2003). 149\nLate granitic plutons cutting the discordance are Ordovician (Loewy et al., 2003).

Southward, this domain merges into a low-grade zone, the Oco\u00f1a phyllonite 153\nzone, that consists of strongly strained greenish chlorite-muscovite schists, grey 154\nmetasandstones, quartz veins and concordant foliated pegmatite bodies. Shear bands, i.e., S-155\nC\u00b4 structures, are widespread and suggest that this is a shear zone with a top-to-the-NE sense 156\nof movement. Relics of an older foliation with discordant pegmatite dykes are locally 157\npreserved in strain shadows, outside which pegmatites are transposed to parallelism with the 158\nshear foliation. This shear zone was attributed to Paleozoic tectonism, probably Devonian, on 159\nstructural grounds only (Shackleton et al., 1979). However, one foliated granite within the 160\nzone yielded an Ordovician age of ca. 464 Ma that is argued by Loewy et al. (2003) as shortly 161\nprior to the low-grade metamorphism (M3). The large Atico igneous complex consists in large 162\npart of diorites variably retrogressed to chlorite - epidote - albite, and abundant pegmatite 163\ndykes. This complex, along with its southern prolongation in the Caman\u00e1 Igneous Complex,164\nwas attributed an age of ca. 450 Ma by Shackleton et al. (1979) on the basis of a combined 165\nRb-Sr whole-rock isochron. 166\n167\nThe southern section 168\n169\nThe Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain is the largest one and consists of high-grade rocks that 170\nunderwent granulite facies UHT metamorphism, with a paragenesis containing 171\northopyroxene+sillimanite+quartz and sapphirine+quartz (Martignole and Martelat, 2003). It 172\nconsists for the most part of monotonous banded migmatitic gneisses formed by variably 173\nrestitic mesosomes and alternating leucosomes (Fig. 2a). Augen-gneisses are found locally,174\nsuch as near Mollendo, that probably formed by stretching of banded migmatites within 175\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nstrongly strained shear zones. Peneconcordant but unstrained muscovite pegmatite sheets are 176\nirregularly distributed throughout the domain, more abundant in the north and northwest 177\nbetween Quilca and Caman\u00e1. Foliation is very regular over long distances. However changes 178\nin dip and strike can be mapped on a regional scale due to large upright post-foliation folds.179\nSmall-scale (cm to m) syn-foliation folds are locally found.180\n181\nThe Ilo domain 182\n183\nThe southernmost Ilo domain is separated from the main massif by a cover of Mesozoic 184\nand Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. This domain is a medium- to low-grade shear zone with 185\nstrongly retrogressed igneous protoliths. The main facies is reddish, variably foliated,186\nporphyritic granite. Boudins of coarse anorthosite that resulted from stretching of older larger 187\nbodies are aligned within the foliated porphyritic granite. A third facies consists of narrow 188\nbands, parallel to foliation, of a dark fine-grained mylonitic rock that contains irregularly 189\ndistributed feldspar porphyroclasts. Contacts are sharp or gradual. Some bands look like 190\nsheared porphyritic granites; others as appear to be derived from dykes that underwent local 191\nmingling with the host granite. Strain increases from anorthosite through the dark bands to the 192\ngranite; mylonitic foliation is common (Fig. 2b). Martignole et al. (2005) considered the 193\nprotoliths to be part of a Grenvillian AMCG suite.   194\n195\n196\nSampling and petrographic description197\n198\nOut of a larger sampling of the whole massif from San Ju\u00e1n down to Ilo, eight samples 199\nwere chosen for U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons and eight for Nd isotope composition. Two 200\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nmuscovite samples were collected from pegmatites. Sampling was aimed at deciphering the 201\ncomplex geological history of this basement and particularly to constrain the age of the 202\nGrenvillian tectonothermal event. Because of the tectonic implications and the expected 203\ninfluence of the alleged Grenvillian anorthosite magmatism in UHT metamorphism (e.g., 204\nArima and Gower, 1991, and references therein) one target was the anorthosite and allied 205\nrocks from Ilo. Determining the protoliths of many of the metamorphic rocks was difficult, 206\nparticularly for the highly recrystallized rocks of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain, and so five 207\nhigh-grade gneisses from this domain were also analysed for REE.208\n209\nSample locations are shown in Fig. 1. Coordinates, description, abbreviated mineralogy 210\nand the analytical work carried out on each sample are shown in Table 1. More detailed 211\npetrographic descriptions of the rocks can be found in Supplementary Table 1, obtainable212\nfrom the Journal of South American Earth Sciences supplementary data file #1. 213\n214\n215\nAnalytical methods216\n217\nREEs were analysed at ACTLABS (Canada) by ICP-MS (Table 4). Samples for Sr and Nd 218\nisotope analysis were crushed and powdered to ~ 200 mesh. Powders were first decomposed 219\nin 4 ml HF and 2 ml HNO3 in Teflon digestion bombs for 48 hours at 120 \u00baC, and finally in 220\n6M HCl. Elemental Rb, Sr, Sm and Nd  were determined by isotope dilution using spikes 221\nenriched in 87Rb, 84Sr, 149Sm and 150Nd. Ion exchange techniques were used to separate the 222\nelements for isotopic analysis. Rb, Sr and REE were separated using Bio-Rad AG50 x 12 223\ncation exchange resin. Sm and Nd were further separated from the REE group using Bio-224\nbeads coated with 10% HDEHP. All isotopic analyses were carried out on a VG Sector 54 225\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nmulticollector mass spectrometer at the Geocronolog\u00eda y Geoqu\u00edmica Isot\u00f3pica Laboratory, 226\nComplutense University, Madrid, Spain.  Nd and Sr isotope data are shown in Tables 2 and 3 227\nrespectively. 228\n229\nU-Pb analyses were performed on eight samples using SHRIMP RG at the Research School 230\nof Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra. Zircon fragments were 231\nmounted in epoxy together with chips of the Temora reference zircon, ground approximately 232\nhalf-way through and polished. Reflected and transmitted light photomicrographs, and 233\ncathodo-luminescence (CL) SEM images, were used to decipher the internal structures of the234\nsectioned grains and to target specific areas within the zircons. Each analysis consisted of 6 235\nscans through the mass range. The data were reduced in a manner similar to that described by 236\nWilliams (1998, and references therein), using the SQUID Excel macro of Ludwig (2001). U-237\nPb data are in Supplementary Table 2 obtainable from the Journal of South American Earth 238\nSciences Data Files 2#. Results are shown in Figs 3-5 and described below.239\n240\n241\nZircon SHRIMP U-Pb samples and results242\n243\nMAR-8. Fine-grained gneiss (meta-igneous) (Fig. 3a). Zircons are elongate (less than 244\n150\u03bcm in length) sub-rounded to euhedral in shape. CL images show that most grains consist 245\nof a core and a rim. Cores are elongate euhedral prisms, although with resorption features, 246\nwith oscillatory zoning that reflects an igneous origin. Rims show low luminescence and are 247\nlarge enough to be analysed. 248\n249\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nEighteen points were analysed including rims and cores. Nine cores yielded 207Pb\/206Pb 250\nages between 1210 and 1813 Ma. If analyses with discordance > 10% are rejected (#12 & 251\n#17), the remaining spots plot near Concordia and yield a mean 207Pb\/206Pb age of 1796\u00b113 252\nMa (MSWD = 1.5), which is interpreted as the crystallization age of the igneous protolith. 253\nThe high Th\/U values of cores (0.32\u20130.34), typical of igneous zircons, reinforce this 254\ninterpretation. Rims are high-U (mostly over 1000 ppm) and with very low Th\/U values 255\n(mostly <0.2) typical of a metamorphic origin. Rim analyses plot on a discordia with an upper 256\nintercept at 1033\u00b123 Ma and a lower intercept at 469\u00b170Ma; taken as the ages of Grenvillian 257\nmetamorphism and early Paleozoic overprint, respectively. The latter gave rise to more 258\npronounced Pb-loss in the Grenvillian rims than in the relict cores.    259\n260\nOCO-26. Meta-sandstone (Fig. 3b). The zircons from this sample are mostly equant, round 261\nto sub-round grains that range up to 200 \u00b5m in diameter but with many less than 50\u2013100\u00b5m.  262\nThe grains are generally clear and colourless, with only some clouded grains, and some that 263\nmay be frosted due to surface transport.  The CL images reveal a complex internal structure 264\n(Fig. 3b).  Many grains comprise a zoned igneous centre, overgrown by metamorphic zircon 265\nwith homogeneous CL.  Also common are grains with metamorphic central areas with lighter 266\nor darker CL outermost metamorphic zircon.  Some grains have multiple stages of zircon 267\ngrowth, the outermost invariably being a bright CL metamorphic rim.268\n269\nGiven the complex nature of the zircon population, 105 areas were analysed on 70 zircon 270\ngrains.  The analyses range up to 30% discordant, although many are within analytical 271\nuncertainty of both the Wetherill (204Pb-corrected data) and Tera-Wasserburg concordias (data 272\nuncorrected for common Pb).  The relative probability plot shows a major peak at 1000 Ma, 273\nwith slightly younger subordinate groups of analyses at ca. 940 Ma and ca. 840 Ma, a 274\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nsequence of minor peaks through the Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1200, 1260, 1340, 1500), and a 275\nsignificant concentration in the interval 1650\u20132030 Ma, as well as a few older ages back to 276\n2770 Ma (Archaean).  The older ages are comparable to those seen in other samples reported 277\nhere. We interpret the major peak at ca. 1000 Ma as corresponding to peak metamorphism of 278\nGrenville-age in the Atico domain. All older ages are interpreted as reflecting detrital grains, 279\nmostly igneous, but also metamorphic mantles.280\n281\nThe data giving the youngest ages tend to plot above the Concordia curve in the Tera-282\nWasserburg diagram (not shown), in part forming a Pb-loss discordia.  These areas are 283\nconsidered to have lost radiogenic Pb and are not interpreted as reflecting Neoproterozoic 284\nmetamorphic zircon.  However, the presence of ages of 850\u2013950 Ma in the analyses of the 285\nouter areas and rims to structured grains record mean that a case can be made for 286\nmetamorphic zircon development later than 1000 Ma.287\n288\nOn the basis of this interpretation, peak metamorphism occurred at ca. 1000 Ma and the 289\nsedimentary protolith may well have formed between this time and the next oldest minor peak 290\nat ca. 1200 Ma, i.e., Late Mesoproterozoic.291\n292\nCAM 2. Migmatitic gneiss (mesosome) (Fig 4a). The zircons from this sample are equant 293\nto elongate, round to subround in shape and less than 200 \u00b5m in length. The CL images 294\nreveal a range of internal structures. Some areas are zoned igneous zircon, whilst other areas295\nhave an irregular wispy structure, and yet others areas are broad and homogeneous. These 296\nfeatures indicate a range of zircon crystallization events from simple igneous crystallization, 297\nto recrystallized zones and then finally metamorphic zircon growth. 298\n299\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nTwenty-four areas were analysed on 21 zircon grains covering the range of internal CL 300\nstructures, and yielding a bimodal distribution. In general the zoned igneous zircon yields 301\nolder Proterozoic dates, whereas the more homogeneous metamorphic areas yield Grenvillian 302\ndates. But this is not always the case: the outer more homogeneous areas on grains #16 and 303\n#18 both yield older Proterozoic dates, whilst the weakly zoned area analysed on grain #17 is 304\nGrenvillian in age. Centres and rims were analysed on grains #10, #15 and #21. Both areas 305\non grain #10 yield concordant Grenville dates, though the irregularly zoned core (#10.2) is 306\nolder than the homogeneous metamorphic rim (#10.1). The irregularly zoned core of grain 307\n#15 is ca. 1960 Ma whereas the homogeneous rim is ca. 1050 Ma. The zoned core of grain 308\n#21 is ca. 1890 Ma, with the homogeneous rim Grenvillian at ca. 1040 Ma.309\n310\nOverall, the older group consists of igneous and perhaps metamorphic core zircon with a 311\nrange of nearly concordant 207Pb\/206Pb ages of 1760 \u20131950 Ma, but with a composite peak at312\nca. 1900 Ma. The Grenvillian metamorphic group is rather variable with, at the older end, one 313\nconcordant age at 1125 Ma and one less so at ca. 1210 Ma, and at the younger end, two 314\n206Pb\/238U  ages less than 1000 ma that probably indicate either Pb-loss of Grenvillian areas or 315\na superimposed thermal event peaking at ca. 980 Ma. The weighted average of the six 316\nremaining 206Pb\/238Pb ages is 1040\u00b111 (MSWD = 0.90), which is taken as the peak of 317\nGrenvillian metamorphism.318\n319\nCAM-7. Migmatitic gneiss (mesosome) (Fig 4b). The zircons from this sample are round, 320\nequant-to-elongate grains that range from less than 100 \u00b5m in diameter to 200\u00b5m or more in 321\nlength. A few multi-lobate grains are present, representing metamorphic overgrowths. The CL 322\nimages, as of sample CAM 2 show a variety of textures and features. There are areas of 323\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nzoned igneous zircon, usually more centrally located within the grains, with both irregular and 324\nhomogenous CL structures in outer areas (mantles) and rims.325\n326\nTwenty-seven areas have been analysed on 20 zircon grains with rim-and-core pairs327\nanalysed for seven grains. The zoned igneous core to grain #17 has an Archaean 207Pb\/206Pb 328\nage of ~2690 Ma whereas the more homogeneous rim area, interpreted as metamorphic, is 329\nGrenvillian in age with a 206Pb\/238U date of ~1120 Ma. The outer areas and zoned igneous 330\nzircons provide a range of nearly concordant 207Pb\/206Pb dates, mostly around 1860 to 2080 331\nMa. The Wetherill plot for the 204Pb-corrected data clearly shows that whilst some areas are 332\nnear Concordia at about either 1950 Ma or 1000 Ma, many of the areas analysed are 333\ndiscordant and would lie on a simple discordia between these two end-members. A discordia 334\nline fitted to a selected group of 22 analyses gives an upper intercept of 1924\u00b125 Ma and 335\nlower intercept of 1026\u00b132 Ma (MSWD = 3.7), the latter being taken as the age of peak336\nGrenvillian metamorphism. The analyses not included in this general discordia line are for 337\n#15.2, with the youngest 207Pb\/206Pb date, and those with 207Pb\/206Pb dates older than 2000 338\nMa. 339\n340\nFrom the current data set it is clear that detrital igneous zircon and probably overgrowths341\nof Paleoproterozoic age are common in this sample. New zircon formed during a Grenville-342\nage event is present. A number of the grains\/areas analysed show variable radiogenic Pb-loss 343\nat this time and so lie on a discordia trend.344\n345\nQUI-16. Migmatitic gneiss (mesosome) (Fig. 4c). Separated zircons are mostly ca. 200 \uf06dm 346\nin length, equant to slightly elongated, and sub-round in form. CL images show complex 347\ninternal structures, with small relict cores (in some cases with igneous zoning) surrounded by 348\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nmantles of variable thickness most of which show broad faint oscillatory zoning, and low-349\nluminiscence rims. The latter are usually complete and discordant to the earlier structures; 350\nthey are of irregular thickness, up to 50 \uf06dm or more on some grain tips. The textures are 351\ninterpreted as due to detrital igneous crystals and successive stages, probably two, of 352\nmetamorphic overgrowth.353\n354\nSixteen areas were analyzed on 15 grains. Both core and mantle were analysed in grain #1. 355\nTwo analyses (# 4 and #8) were carried out on well-developed rims; their 207Pb\/206Pb ages are356\n1079 Ma and 1995 Ma. The other spots were on mantles: Th\/U ratios are generally high 357\n(0.07\u20133.33, with 12 out of 16 ratios being > 0.2). If the more imprecise analyses are excluded,358\nthe rest plot on a simple Discordia (MSWD = 0.9) with an upper intercept at 1861\u00b132 Ma and 359\na poorly defined lower intercept at 1011\u00b173Ma.360\n361\nMOL-17.  Augen-gneiss (uncertain protolith) (Fig. 4d). The zircons from this sample are 362\nround to subround grains that are generally clear. The CL images show complex internal 363\nstructure; many grains have zoned igneous cores, interpreted as igneous, overgrown by more 364\nhomogeneous, probably metamorphic zircon.365\n366\nSixteen grains were analysed, with most of the analyses on the more homogeneous outer 367\nareas of the grains interpreted as metamorphic. The exceptions are the analyses of grain #16, 368\nwhere the zoned core was also analysed (both core and rim giving Archaean ages of ca. 2900 369\nMa). The analyses are generally low in U and the Th\/U ratios range to very high values (0.16\u2013370\n4.06), apart from those of grains #10 and #11 (0.08). The analyses mostly plot on a simple 371\ndiscordia between 1892\u00b162 Ma and 973\u00b182 Ma (MSWD rather high at 2.4). There are a 372\nnumber of discordant analyses, but these do not indicate the presence of intermediate 373\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nMesoproterozoic zircon. The three youngest Grenvillian areas are highly concordant and yield 374\na defined Concordia age of 940\u00b16 Ma (MSWD = 0.004), which is taken as the best age for the 375\nPb-loss and possible metamorphic event. There is a possibility that this rock underwent an 376\nolder thermal event responsible for the Paleoproterozoic ages of some overgrowths. The377\nultimate age of the protolith is unknown as insufficient data were obtained from cores.378\n379\nILO-19. Mylonitic porphyritic granite (Fig. 5a). The abundant zircons in this sample are 380\nelongate, mostly ~200 \u00b5m in length, or longer, with either subround or pyramidal 381\nterminations. Many grains can be seen to be strongly zoned under transmitted light and 382\nalthough many are clear and colourless a few are dark and metamict. CL shows a variety of 383\ninternal structures. Many grains and areas within grains are simple oscillatory zoned zircon,384\nbut there are prominent grains with very irregular internal features and in places these wispy385\nfeatures overprint and cross-cut what is interpreted to be the primary simple igneous zoning.386\n387\nTwenty-three areas were analysed on 20 grains covering the full range of complex internal 388\nCL structures. All 23 analyses yield 206Pb\/238U ages in the range 415\u2013465 Ma and the relative 389\nprobability plot shows a broad peak or peaks centred at about 450 Ma. Apart from 3 analyses 390\n(#3, #4.1 & #15) the data are low in common Pb and the 204Pb-corrected data are within 391\nuncertainty of concordia. There is no evidence for any Grenville-age event in these zircon 392\ngrains. There is a wide range in U and Th contents, but the Th\/U ratios are moderate to high, 393\nreflecting the dominantly igneous nature of the zoned zircon. If the three analyses with high 394\ncommon Pb and all others with >10% discordance are excluded, three possible age peaks can 395\nbe recognized: ca. 460 Ma, ca. 446 Ma and ca 432. The younger peak could be related to 396\nretrogression within the shear zone (overprinting features in zircon grains) which is strong in 397\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nthis rock. 398\n399\nILO-20. Dark mylonitic gneiss (Fig. 5b).  The zircons from this sample are mostly slender, 400\nelongate grains with subhedral terminations.  More equant and bulkier elongate grains are also 401\npresent, tending to be coarser-grained, up to 250\u00b5m in length and 50\u00b5m in width. The CL 402\nimages show a complex internal structure.  Whilst many grains have length-parallel zoning 403\n(interpreted as igneous), more homogeneous, possibly metamorphic, zircon is present both as 404\nrims and in places forming anastomosing embayments into the zoned igneous zircon.405\n406\nTwenty-six areas were analysed on 21 grains ( Fig. 5b). A wide range of the internal 407\nstructures noted above were analysed, with both the zoned igneous and the more 408\nhomogeneous areas interpreted as metamorphic analysed on a number of single grains.  The 409\nresulting data form a dispersed grouping that is dominantly within uncertainty of the Tera-410\nWasserburg Concordia.  Two analyses, #2.2 and #6.1, are more enriched in common Pb; the 411\nformer yields a young 206Pb\/238U date of ca. 438 Ma and the area analysed is considered to 412\nhave lost radiogenic Pb.  The relative probability plot of 206Pb\/238U ages shows a dominant 413\nbell-shaped peak, which yields a weighted mean age of 464\u00b14 (MSWD = 1.07). It is 414\nnoteworthy that this grouping includes both zoned igneous and the more homogeneous zircon 415\nareas; thus the igneous emplacement and subsequent metamorphic developments in these 416\ngrains occurred within the analytical uncertainty of 464 Ma. On the older age side, there is a 417\nsubordinate grouping around ca. 480 Ma (four analyses give a mean of 483\u00b17 Ma) and 418\nscattered older dates to ca. 512 Ma.  The central areas to a number of grains were analysed as 419\nit was originally presumed that this rock would yield a Grenvillian age.  However, whilst 420\nthere are scattered analyses older than the dominant Ordovician peak, there is no evidence for 421\nsuch a Grenville event.422\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n423\nILO-23. Anorthosite (Fig. 5c). Only a few zircon grains were separated from this sample (7 424\non the probe mount). They are elongate and range from clear subhedral forms to dark, 425\nmetamict subhedral grains. The CL images are very dark, but relict igneous zoning can be 426\nseen. 427\n428\nSeven areas were analysed on 6 grains; they have high U ranging from 1700 to 3065 ppm, 429\nwith relatively moderate Th and Th\/U ratios in the range 0.08 \u20130.21. This is on the slightly 430\nlow side for normal igneous zircon but may reflect late-stage magmatic crystallisation or 431\npartial melting. The areas analysed are low in common Pb, but not ideal in terms of zircon 432\nclarity or good CL structure. The relative probability plot for the limited number of analyses 433\nis irregular, with one clearly older analysis and some skew to the young age side. A weighted 434\nmean of the 206Pb\/238U ages for 5 of the 7 analyses provides an estimated crystallisation date 435\nof 464\u00b15 Ma (MSWD = 1.0).436\n437\n438\nPegmatites439\n440\nBecause Rb is strongly fractionated in muscovite relative to Sr, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio in the 441\nmineral increases very quickly time and the calculated age is insensitive to the assumed initial 442\nvalues for calc-alkaline magmas. The ages of two muscovite samples obtained in this way 443\nwere 1000 and 1100 Ma (Table 3), i.e., Grenvillian. These pegmatites, although roughly 444\nconcordant to their host rocks, do not show evidence for ductile deformation and\/or 445\nsuperimposed metamorphism, and the Rb-Sr ages are taken as dating magmatic 446\ncrystallization.447\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n448\n449\nREE and Nd isotope data450\n451\nREE data for five samples of high-grade gneisses from the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain 452\n(Table  4) are plotted in Fig. 6. They show enrichment in LREE relative to HREE, with 453\n(La\/Yb)N values between 13.5 and 24, and a small negative Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu* = ca. 0.8). 454\nREEs patterns are remarkably similar in the five gneisses suggesting that they were all 455\nderived from the same type of protolith. They are also strikingly similar to those of shales, 456\ne.g., the North American Shale Composite (Taylor and McLennan, 1988), so that it may be457\ninferred that the gneisses were derived from detrital sedimentary rocks. The small differences 458\namong the five rocks analysed here may be attributed to variable melt extraction during 459\nmigmatization.   460\n461\nNd isotope composition is available for the five high-grade gneisses (Table 2). They 462\nyielded \uf065Ndt values of -5.5 to -8.2 at the reference age of 1700 Ma. Nd single-stage depleted-463\nmantle model ages (TDM, DePaolo et al. 1981) range between ca. 2.3 and 2.5 Ga.464\n465\nNd isotope composition is also available for three meta-igneous rocks from the Ilo domain. 466\n\uf065Ndt values at the reference age of 475 Ma (Table 2) differ significantly from one rock to 467\nanother: -6.4 (ILO-19), -7.8 (ILO-20) and -3.6 (ILO-23), the latter being for the anorthosite. 468\nThe value for ILO-20, the mafic gneiss, is less primitive than that of the granite, perhaps 469\nindicating different protoliths and not only strain differences between the two rocks as might 470\nbe argued from field evidence alone. 471\n472\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nDiscussion473\n474\nTwo views emerge from these data. 1) The geological history of the Arequipa massif 475\ncovers a very long period of time, between Paleoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic 476\n(Ordovician\u2013Silurian). 2) Three main rock-forming events took place, at widely separated 477\ntimes: in the Paleoproterozoic, in the Late Mesoproterozoic and in the Paleozoic.     478\n479\nThe Paleoproterozoic. An old orogenic history480\n481\nThe protolith of the strongly retrogressed quartzose gneiss MAR-8 from the San Ju\u00e1n482\nMarcona domain was a felsic igneous rock, probably volcanic or subvolcanic. Its age of483\n1796\u00b113 Ma (Late Paleoproterozoic) coincides with a discordia upper intercept age of 484\n1793\u00b16 Ma found by Loewy et al. (2004) for a retrogressed foliated megacrystic granite 485\nnearby (sample U\/Pb-3). The age of ca. 1.79 Ga thus corresponds to an event of felsic 486\nmagmatism. Moreover, this age constrains the age of the host metasedimentary rocks that 487\nwere coeval or older.488\n489\nMigmatitic gneisses of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain, although separated from the San 490\nJu\u00e1n domain by the Atico medium-grade rocks and the Oco\u00f1a Phyllonite zone, probably 491\ncorrespond to the same geological domain, although they are generally less retrogressed and 492\nappear to contain material older than the igneous protolith in the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona domain. 493\nMost of the migmatitic gneisses are probably metasedimentary, as inferred from both the 494\nsimilarity of their REE pattern to those of shales and the high peraluminosity evidenced by 495\nthe mineral compositions (Martignole & Martelat, 2003).  496\n497\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nAll the samples contain Paleoproterozoic zircons that underwent a metamorphic overprint 498\nof Grenvillian age. Low-discordance Paleoproterozoic ages range from 1.76 to 2.1 Ga. A few 499\nscattered Archaean zircons were also found (ca. 2.7 Ga in CAM-7, ca. 2.9 Ga in MOL-17).500\nMoreover, the Paleoproterozoic ages embrace detrital cores with relict igneous zoning and501\nthick subrounded, homogeneous or weakly concentrically-zoned, overgrowths (mantles). The 502\nlatter features are common in high-grade metamorphic zircons (Vavra et al., 1999; Corfu et 503\nal., 2003). Most of the analysed areas were overgrowths, most of them with Th\/U values 504\nhigher than most metamorphic zircons (which tend to have values < 0.1). This fact however 505\nhas been also recognized in other high-grade metamorphic areas (e.g., Goodge et al., 2001) 506\nand, of particular relevance, in UHT metamorphic regions, e.g., in the Napier Complex, 507\nAntarctica (Carson et al., 2002). Such high Th\/U values in metamorphic mantles are attributed 508\nto U-depletion during UHT metamorphism prior to zircon growth (Black et al., 1986; Carson 509\net al., 2002). We propose that the zircon overgrowths in the Arequipa massif migmatitic 510\ngneisses probably resulted from UHT metamorphism in the Paleoproterozoic.511\n512\n  Samples CAM-2 and CAM-7 contain detrital igneous cores of 1890 Ma to 2080 Ma that,513\nalong with the few Archaean cores referred to above, suggest magmatic events in the source 514\narea of the sedimentary protoliths in the Middle Paleoproterozoic (Rhyacian and Orosirian) 515\nand in the Archaean. Most of the analysed zircon areas plot on discordias resulting from Pb-516\nloss during Grenvillian metamorphism, and as most correspond to mantles on older cores, the 517\nupper intercept ages probably date metamorphism. The strongest cases are for samples QUI-518\n16 and MOL-17, where only overgrowths were considered for regression; the resulting ages 519\nare 1861\u00b132 Ma and 1892\u00b162 Ma, respectively. Thus a metamorphic event at ca. 1.87 Ga is 520\ninferred for the Paleoproterozoic overgrowths. Whether these Paleoproterozoic overgrowths 521\nformed in situ or were detrital is more difficult to assess. Zircon grains in samples QUI-16 522\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nand MOL-17 show overgrowths that are quite regular and complete around detrital igneous 523\ncores (Fig. 4). This might be taken as compatible with overgrowth formation in situ and 524\nconsequently with a metamorphic event in the Caman\u00e1-Mollendo domain at ca.1.87 Ga. This 525\ninterpretation strengthens that of Loewy et al. (2004), who argued on geological grounds for a 526\nmetamorphic event (M1) and deformation at ca. 1.8 Ga, i.e., prior to the intrusion of the 527\nmegacrystic granite (U\/Pb3). Consequently, the age of the sedimentary protoliths of the 528\nmigmatitic gneisses can now be bracketed with some confidence between ca. 1.87 and the 529\nminimum age of detrital igneous zircons, i.e., ca. 1.9 Ga. In consequence sedimentary 530\nprotoliths formed shortly before metamorphism. Quite similarly Cobbing et al. (1977), 531\nDalmayrac et al.(1977) and Shackleton et al. (1979) argued in favour of a granulite facies 532\nregional metamorphism between ca. 1.8 and 1.95 Ma, with protolith ages of ca. 2000 Ma. 533\nHowever these authors considered that the granulitic gneisses resulted from a single 534\nmetamorphic event and did not recognize the superimposed Grenvillian event (see below). 535\n536\nNd isotope values (TDM between ca. 2.3 and 2.55 Ga) suggest that Nd in the Caman\u00e1-537\nMollendo migmatitic gneisses is largely reworked from an old continental crustal material, 538\nPaleoproterozoic and\/or Archaean. This is compatible with the presence in some samples of 539\nold detrital zircons of ca. 2690 Ma (CAM-7) and ca. 2900 Ma (MOL-17) that indicate an540\nArchaean source. Moreover, the crustal source of the zircons experienced magmatism at 541\ndifferent times between ca. 1.9 and 2.1 Ga, probably with addition of a juvenile component to 542\nthe upper continental crust. This constitutes a significant fingerprint of the source area, i.e., 543\nold Nd model ages and a younger zircon population.544\n545\nAs for the Paleoproterozoic, the pattern that emerges from zircon ages and the geological 546\nand geochemical evidence is one of an orogeny between ca. 1.79 and 2.1 Ga (Orosirian to 547\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nRhyacian) involving: a) early magmatism (between 1.89 and 2.1Ga), presumably through 548\npartly Archaean continental crust, b) sedimentation of a thick sequence of terrigenous 549\nsediments, c) UHT metamorphism at ca. 1.87 Ga, and d) late felsic magmatism at ca. 1.79 550\nGa.551\n552\nThe Atico domain: a Mesoproterozoic sedimentary basin.553\n554\nThe only sample from this medium-grade metamorphic domain (OCO-26) shows 555\nsimilarities to the migmatitic gneisses of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain, but also significant 556\ndifferences. Many low-discordance areas yield ages between 1700 and 2030 Ma and a few are557\nArchaean, between 2600 and 2800 Ma (one discordant age ca. 3100 Ma). These ages are from558\ndetrital igneous cores and metamorphic mantles, and are similar to the Proterozoic to 559\nArchaean low-discordance ages found in the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo and San Ju\u00e1n domains. On 560\nthe other hand, OCO-26 contains zircons with nearly concordant ages between ca. 1200 and 561\nca. 1600 Ma. This group of ages has not been recognized in the high-grade domains; we 562\ninterpret these zircons as detrital. Grenvillian metamorphism started at ca. 1000 Ma.563\n564\nDeposition of the sedimentary protolith of OCO-26 occurred between ca. 1200 and565\nca.1000 Ma, i.e., in the Late Mesoproterozoic. Detrital zircons were fed from a source area 566\nsimilar to the high-grade Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo and San Ju\u00e1n domains, but also from an567\nunknown source that provided the Mesoproterozoic zircons of 1200\u20131600 Ma. The Atico 568\ndomain can thus be interpreted as a sedimentary basin deposited on a Paleoproterozoic high-569\ngrade basement consisting of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Cobbing et al. (1977) first 570\nconsidered the Atico metasedimentary rocks to be younger than the Mollendo high-grade 571\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \ngneisses because of the presence of quartzites, absent in Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain. However 572\nthis opinion was challenged by Wasteneys et al. (1995).573\n    574\nThe Grenville-age metamorphic event575\n576\nAll the zircon populations from the San Ju\u00e1n, Atico and Caman\u00e1-Mollendo samples show 577\nthe imprint of a metamorphic event Late-Mesoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic in age. 578\nThis metamorphism produced Pb-loss on both older zircon igneous cores and on 579\nPaleoproterozoic overgrowths, giving rise to linear discordias, and probably new overgrowths 580\nin the form of contrasting luminescence rims. Recorded Grenvillian ages can be bracketed 581\nbetween ca. 940 and ca. 1080 Ma, taking age uncertainties into account. In the Caman\u00e1-582\nMollendo domain Grenvillian ages are apparently older in the Quilca and Caman\u00e1 samples 583\n(CAM-2: 1040\u00b111 Ma; CAM-7: 1026\u00b132 Ma; QUI-16: 1011\u00b173 Ma) than in the Mollendo 584\nsample (MOL-17: 940\u00b16 Ma), a fact that was also recognized by Wasteneys et al. (1995; 585\npoint C: 966\u00b15 Ma) and by Loewy et al. (2004; sample U\/Pb-2: 935\u00b114 Ma). Sample MAR-8 586\nfrom the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona domain yielded an age of 1033\u00b123 Ma for the Grenvillian event, 587\ni.e., within error of those of the southern Caman\u00e1-Mollendo domain. The weighted average 588\nage of metamorphism in northern Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo and San Ju\u00e1n Marcona is 1037\u00b119 Ma. 589\nIn the Atico domain we found a spread of Grenvillian ages between ca. 1000 and ca. 840 Ma. 590\nThe latter domain underwent only Grenvillian metamorphism, in contrast with the Caman\u00e1\u2013591\nMollendo domain, which besides Grenvillian metamorphism underwent an older 592\nPaleoproterozoic event. Martignole and Martelat (2003) carried out chemical dating of 593\nmonazites from the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain and found a spread of Grenvillian ages; 594\nstatistically meaningful ages of ca. 1000 Ma were obtained for three samples near Caman\u00e1. 595\nMoreover, muscovite pegmatites, probably migmatitic melts, were emplaced during the 596\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nGrenvillian event (1000 and 1100 Ma) as inferred from the Sr isotope composition of 597\nmuscovites presented here.598\n599\nGrenville-age metamorphism at Arequipa took thus place in as many as three separate 600\nepisodes: 1) ca. 1040 Ma in the Quilca and Caman\u00e1 areas of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain, 601\nand in the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona domain, 2) at 940\u00b16 Ma in the Mollendo area of the Caman\u00e1-602\nMollendo domain; 3) between ca. 1000 and 840 Ma in the Atico domain. This evidence 603\nsuggests that in the Arequipa massif metamorphic domains are juxtaposed that underwent 604\nGrenvillian metamorphism at different times and had different cooling histories. 605\n606\nIt is difficult to distinguish the effects of the Grenvillian metamorphic overprint on the 607\nolder UHT paragenesis. Martignole & Martelat (2003), although favouring a single 608\nmetamorphism of Grenville-age, leave this question open, suggesting that this might 609\ncorrespond to the lowest-P event (T<900\u00baC) they recognized. In our hypothesis that the UHT 610\nmetamorphism in Arequipa was Paleoproterozoic, temperatures attained during Grenvillian 611\nmetamorphism had to be high enough to completely reset the Th-U-Pb system in monazites 612\n(ca. 730\u00baC; Copeland et al., 1988; Parrish, 1990) unless the monazite formed only during the 613\nGrenvillian event. Moreover Grenville-age Ms-pegmatites are evidence for renewed partial 614\nmelting at this time. Temperatures between 730\u00ba and 900\u00baC were thus probably attained 615\nduring Grenvillian metamorphism in the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain. In the Atico domain616\nhowever, Grenvillian metamorphism only attained P-T values within the stability field of 617\nstaurolite+andalusite (Shackleton et al., 1979) implying a low-pressure type of 618\nmetamorphism.619\n620\nPaleozoic events: the Ordovician magmatic arc621\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n622\nOrdovician crystallization ages found here for the igneous protoliths of the Ilo domain623\nwere unexpected. Martignole et al. (2005) interpreted these rocks as a Grenvillian AMGC 624\n(anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite) suite on the basis of locally preserved relict high-625\ntemperature minerals such as pyroxenes and alleged metamorphic garnet, and Nd model ages 626\nof ca. 1.15 Ga. In our samples those minerals are absent. However minerals such as 627\nhornblende, biotite and rutile (in anorthosite) are preserved in the less retrogressed rocks 628\n(ILO-20 and ILO-23) and also argue in favour of an earlier high-temperature history629\nincluding igneous crystallization in a deep magma chamber and metamorphism. The latter,630\nwhich is evidenced by zircon overgrowths on igneous cores (e.g., ILO-20), took place within 631\nthe analytical uncertainty of the crystallization ages. Ages of igneous zircons of ca. 460 Ma 632\nplace this magmatism within the Famatinian orogenic cycle, well-known in NW Argentina,633\nwhich took place along the proto-Andean margin of Gondwana (Pankhurst et al., 2000; 634\nDahlquist et al., 2008, and references therein). Loewy et al. (2004) obtained U-Pb ages 635\nbetween 440 and 468 Ma for late granitic intrusions in the Arequipa massif. Nd isotope 636\nconsiderations suggest that the Ilo magmatism involved variable contamination with an 637\nevolved continental crust (\u03b5Nd = -3.6 to -7.8; TDM = 1.5 to 1.8 Ga) with some evidence for 638\nmixing\/mingling between magmas.639\n       640\nA Paleozoic metamorphic event is also recorded in the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona domain. Here 641\n(sample MAR-8), an event that produced variable Pb-loss of Grenvillian and Paleoproterozoic 642\nzircon is suggested by a discordia with a lower intercept  at 469\u00b170 Ma. Strong retrogression 643\nin the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona and Oco\u00f1a areas was attributed by Loewy et al. (2004) to an M3 644\ntectonothermal event at ca. 465 Ma, i.e., Ordovician, as inferred from the U-Pb ages of  645\nalleged  pre- and post-metamorphic plutons in the area. This event correlates with the 646\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nMarcona event of Shackleton et al. (1979), which produced a foliation (S3) and greenschist-647\nfacies retrogression of the basement gneisses. The Oco\u00f1a phyllonite zone that separates the 648\nAtico domain from the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain was attributed to this M3-S3 event649\n(Shackleton et al., 1979; Loewy et al., 2004).650\n651\nIn the Ilo domain, zircons from the mylonitic dark gneiss and mylonitic porphyritic granite 652\nrecord evidence of overprinting at 430\u2013440 Ma that could be related to retrogression within 653\nthe shear zone. This age is within error of that found at San Ju\u00e1n Marcona and attests to 654\nmetamorphic processes in Ordovician to Silurian times. This Ordovician to Silurian low-grade655\nmetamorphic overprint was largely restricted to shear zones and basement areas near the 656\ncontact with cover sequences of Neoproterozoic age, such as in the San Ju\u00e1n Marcona domain657\n(Shackleton et al., 1979; Chew et al., 2007). Focused flow of water-rich fluids along these 658\nzones played a significant role in metamorphism. Large areas of the Arequipa massif,659\nhowever, do not record any evidence of Paleozoic metamorphism. 660\n661\nCorrelations and geodynamic implications662\n663\nThere is agreement that the Laurentia and Amazonia cratons were juxtaposed across the 664\nGrenvillian orogenic belt at the end of Rodinia amalgamation at ca. 1.0 Ga (e.g., Dalziel, 665\n1997; Davidson, 1995; Loewy et al., 2003; Tohver et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008). Models differ 666\nhowever on the relative position of these cratons, either in the NE (relative to present-day 667\nNorth America) or in the SE. Fig. 7 shows a paleomagnetically-constrained paleogeography at668\nca. 1.2 Ga, i.e., the alleged age of collision, according to Tohver et al. (2004). It shows the 669\nlocation of the Grenville belt of North America and its alleged counterpart along the western 670\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nand southwestern margin of Amazonia, together with outcrops of basement in the central 671\nAndes region with Grenvillian ages of interest to this contribution.672\n673\nThe Arequipa massif is a Paleoproterozoic inlier overprinted by the Grenvillian orogeny. 674\nCorrelation with other Paleoproterozoic terranes in Laurentia or Amazonia is hindered by the 675\nisolation of the Arequipa massif. Compared with the ages of Paleoproterozoic orogenies in 676\nLaurentia (e.g., Goodge & Vervoort, 2006, fig. 1; Goodge et al., 2004, fig. 16) the age interval 677\n1.76\u20132.1 Ga of Paleoproterozoic zircon in the San Ju\u00e1n and Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domains 678\nembraces the Yavapai orogeny (1.7\u20131.8 Ga) and the Penokean and Trans-Hudson orogenies 679\n(1.8\u20132.0 Ga; Schulz & Cannon, 2007; Whitmayer and Karlstrom, 2007). If formerly part of 680\nLaurentia, the Arequipa massif would be a relic of the pre-Grenvillian southern margin of the 681\ncontinent (present coordinates) isolated from the northern Paleoproterozoic belts by younger682\njuvenile accretionary belts (Mazatzal and the Granite-Rhyolite province: 1.7\u20131.3 Ga; Fig. 7). 683\nThe Laurentian connection was favoured by Wasteneys et al. (1995) and Loewy et al. (2003, 684\n2004). On the other hand, rocks equivalent in age are also found in the Venturi\u2013Tapaj\u00f3s belt 685\nof the Amazonia craton (2.0\u20131.8 Ga; Cordani and Teixeira, 2007). Nevertheless, the latter is a 686\njuvenile accretionary belt whilst the Arequipa massif is a block of reworked continental crust. 687\nMoreover the Venturi\u2013Tapaj\u00f3s belt is quite distant from the Arequipa massif even in current 688\nreconstructions, which would imply a significant lateral displacement before Grenvillian 689\nmetamorphism.690\n691\nThe Rio Apa block, south of present day Amazonia (Fig. 7), is another area to be 692\nconsidered, with U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages largely coincident with those of detrital zircons 693\nin the Arequipa migmatitic gneisses (Cordani et al., 2008).  Here widespread granitoid 694\ngneisses (1.94 Ga) were intruded by granitic plutons of the Alumiador Intrusive Suite (ca.695\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n1.83 Ga) and younger orthogneisses between 1.7 and 1.76 Ga. Nd model ages are between 2.2 696\nand 2.53 Ga (Cordani et al., 2005). Allegedly Paleoproterozoic metamorphism was medium-697\nto high-grade (Cordani et al., 2008), but so far no evidence of UHT metamorphism has been 698\nrecorded. The Rio Apa block was overprinted by a Grenville-age thermal event between ca.699\n1.3 and 1.0 Ga (Cordani et al., 2005) and with the Arequipa massif could thus be part of a 700\nlarger Paleoproterozoic inlier within the South American counterpart of the Grenville orogen.701\nThe Maz domain in the Western Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina contains metasedimentary 702\nrocks with Paleoproterozoic zircons (1.7\u20131.9 Ga) and old Nd model ages (1.7\u20132.7 Ga), and 703\nwas also reworked by the Grenvillian orogeny (Casquet et al., 2008), so that it could also be 704\npart of the same continental block.705\n706\nAccretion of the Arequipa massif to Amazonia has been attributed to the Grenvillian707\n(Suns\u00e1s) orogeny (Wasteneys et al., 1995; Loewy et al., 2004). Grenvillian ages of igneous 708\nrocks and metamorphism were early recognized along the southeastern margin of the 709\nAmazonia craton by Priem (1971) and Lintherland et al. (1989). The latter coined the name 710\nSuns\u00e1s orogeny for this tectonothermal event and attributed to it an age of ca. 1000 Ma. 711\nOrogeny involved folding and metamorphism along discrete metasedimentary belts that wrap 712\naround an older metamorphic core, the Rondonian\u2013San Ignacio province (1.5\u20131.3 Ga; 713\nCordani and Teixeira, 2007). Tohver et al. (2004) summarized the Grenvillian history as 714\nconsisting of two events, an older one of Laurentia\u2013Amazonia collision (1.2\u20131.12 Ga), and a 715\nyounger one of alleged oblique convergence and intracontinental strike-slip at ca. 1.1716\n(Suns\u00e1s\u2013Aguapei\u2013Nova Brasilandia orogeny). The second event was accompanied by 717\nmagmatism and metamorphism within the metasedimentary belts. Metamorphism was mostly 718\nof low grade but also reached granulitic facies (at Nova Brasilandia), dated at 1.09 Ga with 719\ncooling through 920 Ma. Precise U-Pb SHRIMP ages led Boger et al. (2005) to constrain720\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nSuns\u00e1s deformation as predating ca. 1070 Ma. Santos et al. (2008) revisited the tectonic 721\nevolution of the southern margin of Amazonia and re-interpreted the Suns\u00e1s orogeny as an 722\nautochthonous orogen involving four orogenic pulses between 1465 and 1110 Ma, suggesting 723\na Laurentia\u2013Amazonia connection at ca. 1450 Ma. The period between 1070 Ma and ca. 980 724\nMa was apparently a period of craton stabilization, with anorogenic granitic magmatism along 725\nthe southern margin of Amazonia (Santos et al., 2008; Cordani and Teixeira, 2007, and 726\nreferences therein).727\n728\nIn the Grenville province of Canada the Grenvillian orogenic cycle started at ca. 1.25 Ga 729\nand ended at ca. 850 Ma (Davidson, 1995, Rivers, 1997). Between 1100 and ca. 980 Ma, the 730\norogenic cycle involved two contractional episodes: the widespread penetrative Ottawan 731\norogeny (1080\u20131020 Ma) and the more localized Rigolet event (1000\u2013980 Ma). In a recent 732\ninterpretation of the crustal-scale orogenic evolution of the Grenville province, Rivers (2008) 733\nargued that collapse of the Ottawan thickened orogen took place during the time interval 734\n1050\u20131020. Former contractional structures were reworked in extension and AMGC 735\ncomplexes were intruded that heated the middle crust. Horst-and-graben structures developed 736\nat this time in the upper crust. During the time interval 1020\u2013950 Ma the Grenville province 737\nunderwent contraction at the Grenville front. The hinterland however underwent protracted 738\nextensional collapse over this period with development of extensional shear zones, deep 739\nductile detachments and metamorphism (Rivers, 2008).     740\n741\nThe contractional phase of the Ottawan orogeny (1080\u20131050 Ma) and the older Grenvillian 742\norogenic cycle events are not recognized in the Arequipa massif. However, the coincidence of 743\nthe Arequipa massif Grenvillian metamorphic ages of 1040\u2013840 Ma with protracted extension744\nboth in the Laurentian Grenville orogen (except for the localized Rigolet pulse at ca. 1.0 Ga)745\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nand in southern Amazonia suggests that metamorphism in Arequipa, which was low-P type,746\nmight be related to overall extension and heating, and not to collision as formerly argued. The747\nprecise tectonic setting remains unknown and more structural work is required to constrain it.748\nLaurentia\u2013Amazonia collision took probably place earlier, at ca. 1.2 Ga (Tohver et al., 2004) 749\nor during the Ottawan orogeny (Rivers, 1977, 2008) but is not recognized in the Arequipa 750\nmassif except for the detrital zircons of 1200\u20131260 Ma in the Atico metasedimentary rocks.751\nWhether formerly part of Laurentia or of Amazonia, the location of Arequipa before collision 752\nremains uncertain.753\n754\nThe Atico sedimentary basin that formed between 1200 and 1000 Ma might be also 755\nrelated to the protracted extensional event referred to above. The magmatism at Ilo that 756\nincluded anorthosites was not involved in the Grenvillian metamorphism. Grenvillian 757\nmetamorphic domains with different P-T-t histories were probably juxtaposed across low-758\ngrade shear zones in the Ordovician\u2013Silurian.759\n760\n761\nConclusions762\n763\nThe Arequipa massif is a Paleoproterozoic inlier in the South American Grenville-age 764\norogen. It was probably part of a larger continental block that also included the R\u00edo Apa block 765\nand the western Sierras Pampeanas Maz terrane. 766\n767\nThe Paleoproterozoic pattern that emerges is one of an orogeny between ca. 1.79 and 2.1 768\nGa (Orosirian to Rhyacian) involving: a) early magmatism (between 1.89 and 2.1Ga), 769\npresumably through partly Archaean continental crust, b) sedimentation of a thick sequence 770\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nof terrigenous sediments, c) UHT metamorphism at ca. 1.87 Ga, and d) late felsic magmatism 771\nat ca. 1.79 Ga.772\n773\nThe Atico domain can be interpreted as a sedimentary basin deposited on a 774\nPaleoproterozoic high-grade basement consisting of igneous and metamorphic rocks. 775\nDeposition occurred between ca. 1200 and ca.1000 Ma, i.e., in the Late Mesoproterozoic. 776\nDetrital zircons were fed from a source area similar to the high-grade Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo and 777\nSan Ju\u00e1n domains, but also from an unknown source that provided Mesoproterozoic zircons 778\nof 1260 \u20131600 Ma.779\n780\nGrenville-age metamorphism at Arequipa took place in up to three stages: 1) ca. 1040 Ma 781\nin the Quilca and Caman\u00e1 areas of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain, and in the San Ju\u00e1n 782\nMarcona domain, 2) 940\u00b16 Ma in the Mollendo area of the Caman\u00e1\u2013Mollendo domain; 3) 783\nbetween 1000 and 850 Ma in the Atico domain. In the Arequipa massif metamorphic domains 784\nare therefore juxtaposed that underwent different Grenvillian metamorphic histories. The 785\ngeodynamic significance of Grenvillian metamorphism is unknown but it could be related to 786\nextension and not to collision as formerly argued.787\n788\nDuring the early Paleozoic the Arequipa massif underwent magmatism at ca. 465 Ma and 789\nfocused retrogression along shear zones or unconformities between 430 and 440 Ma. 790\n791\nAcknowledgements792\n793\nFinancial support for this work was provided by Spanish MEC grant CGL2005-794\n02065\/BTE and Universidad Complutense grant 910495 and Argentinian  PICT 1009.
