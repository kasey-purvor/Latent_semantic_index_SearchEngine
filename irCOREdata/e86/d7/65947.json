Each plays all of the \nothers. If teams have home grounds or stadia then each pair plays twice \u2013 \nhome and away. Points are awarded depending on the outcome of each \nencounter and the team or player with the greatest number of points is the \nwinner. This form of competition is almost universal in organised, especially \nprofessional, sport. For the spectator the enjoyment arises in part from the \nquality of the encounters (was it a good game?) and in part from the \naccumulation of points and the rewards that follow. But there is, arguably, \nanother consideration; the extent to which the tournament is characterised by \ncompetitors of broadly similar competence resulting in some real uncertainty \nas to the outcome or, at the other extreme, dominance by one or a small \nnumber of competitors leading to predictable outcomes which, while the \nperformances may be technically admirable, nonetheless detracts from the \ncontest as spectacle. As well as competition for the top position there will \nusually be other outcomes of interest to fans: whether local rivals are beaten, \nwhether performance this year is better than that of last year, and so on. The \ncloseness of these results within the main competition add considerably to the \nwide appeal of the league across the whole season. \n 3\n It is reasonable to seek some structural description of the results of a season \nof matches. The final league positions or points total provide a one-\ndimensional description. A two-dimensional description is provided by a \nnetwork the links of which describe interactions between pairs of teams and \nmay give both a better understanding of how the final positions were obtained \nand also a feeling for the characteristics of  the matches themselves. It is the \npurpose of this paper to propose just such a model. While in principle the \ngreater level of detail offered by this approach should provide a fuller \nstructural description this may be mitigated by the extra demands made of the \ndata. It may also be the case that the structure which is apparent at a high \nlevel of aggregation (the final result) is inherently less apparent when the data \nare disaggregated. \n \nThe purpose is therefore twofold: to describe and apply a suitable network \nmodel and to use the results obtained to investigate the degree to which a \nparticular soccer league may be said to exhibit structure. \n \nThis paper is organised as follows: different ideas of competitiveness are \nconsidered and a network model is proposed; the model is applied and the \nresults obtained are presented; the results and application of the model are \ndiscussed. \n \n \nThe data \n 4\n The data used as illustration are taken from football (soccer) and are the \nresults in the English Premiership. English professional football is organised \ninto four leagues or divisions (the names seem to vary but since \u201cleague\u201d has \na better marketing ring it seems to be gaining the upper hand). These used to \nbe called simply Division One down to Division Four (or, for those of us of \nthe necessary antiquity, Division Three South and Division Three North). In \nthe season 1995-6 (hereafter just 1995) the highest division set itself apart \nwith a separate management in order better to exploit the commercial \nrevenues available, primarily from the sale of television rights. This highest \ndivision was called the Premiership, now the Barclays Premiership in \nrecognition of sponsorship. The next division is now called the Coca Cola \nChampionship and the third and fourth divisions are Coca Cola League One \nand Coca Cola League Two (the marketing folk march on). \n \nThere are twenty teams in the Premiership. Each plays all of the other \nnineteen twice, at home and away, giving 380 matches in all. Three points are \nawarded for a win and one for a draw. These points are aggregated to give a \nfinal table of results. In the event that two teams have the same number of \npoints the tie is resolved by the goal difference of each; the goal difference \nbeing the difference between the total number of goals scored and conceded \nby that team. Figure 1 shows the final points scores for each of the nine \nseasons studied in this paper. \n \n 5\nThe top four teams are eligible to play in a pan European competition, the \nChampions League, the following year. The next three teams play in a less \nprestigious European competition, the UEFA cup. As well as kudos \nparticipation in these European competitions also brings considerable \nadditional revenues. \n \nThe bottom three clubs are relegated and replaced by the top three clubs from \nthe Championship. Again, the financial implications are great. \n \nThe data used in this paper are the results of the nine seasons from 1995 until \n2003. \n \n \nCompetitiveness \n \nThe award and aggregation of points provides some measure of \ncompetitiveness: the spread of points might reasonably be seen as an \nindication of how competitive the season of matches has been. From Figure 1 \nit is easy to see that the 2003 season in which Arsenal carried all before them, \nnot losing one of their 38 matches, was not prima facie as competitive as, say, \nthe 1997 season in which the spread of points was less. The first two lines of \nTable 1 give the mean number of points and the standard deviation. \n \nHowever, while the total number of points awarded gives an idea of overall \nperformance it misses an important dimension of competition. For those fans \n 6\nfollowing a particular team and for neutral observers much of the excitement \nand interest of the season is to do with the degree to which that team has not \nbeen dominated by, nor has dominated, others. It is generally assumed that \nsome degree of uncertainty about the outcome of the match has a beneficial \neffect on attendance at football matches (Peel and Thomas, 1992; Forrest and \nSimmons, 2002) and also at rugby games (Peel and Thomas, 1997). This \nuncertainty is determined by a number of factors, some of which are \nstructural \u2013 broadly the underlying differences in ability between teams \u2013 and \nsome of which are specific \u2013 local derbies (matches between local rivals) \nbeing an often cited example. The competitiveness inherent in a match will \nalso vary through time; the end of the season seeing both vigorously \ncontested matches to determine matters of qualification at the top of the table \nand relegation at the bottom, and also fairly meaningless middle of the table \ncontests. (This latter is not a necessary condition of league competitions. In \nthe NFL football league in the US the order in which teams select incoming \nplayers for a new season \u2013 the draft \u2013 is determined by league position, the \nbottom team having first pick.) In trying to estimate the outcomes of \nparticular matches it is sometimes assumed that betting odds contain useful \ninformation about these various factors (Peel and Thomas, 1992, 1997; \nForrest and Simmons, 2002)   although a Poisson model has been used to \nsimulate match results (Crowder et al, 2002; Croucher, 2004). A regression \nmodel using several variables has also been used for this purpose (Dobson \nand Goddard, 2004). \n \n 7\nIn this paper we focus not on forecasting individual results but rather on \nretrospective description of a season's play and on whether this has changed \nover the  nine years of the Premiership. The strategy essentially is that the \nresults of the 380 matches define the links in a twenty node network and that \nthis permits the construction of a measure describing the degree to which \nnodes can be grouped into blocks of similarly performing teams. It is these \npairwise competitions which both underlie the final league positions of the \nteams and also describe the individual tussles which give richness and variety \nto the league season for the fans of all twenty teams. Describing the season at \nthis more detailed level will provide a fuller appreciation of the structure of \ncompetitiveness within the league. The two descriptions of  the results \u2013 \nblocks and the league table of points \u2013 are both mappings of the results and \nshould be seen as complementary. Blocks are based on pairwise competitions \nand so motivations may be particular to the pair of teams, as in local derbies \nor other contests between foes of long standing. Points, on the other hand, \ndetermine the all-important league positions and the financial consequences \nthereof. \n \n \nDifferences in performance \n \nOne of the main and consistent factors affecting match outcomes is home \nadvantage. We avoid this bias by looking only at results aggregated over both \ngames that a pair of teams play.  \n \n 8\nPerhaps the most obvious measure of the difference in performance between \ntwo teams, i and j, is the goal difference. Define  \n \ngij  =  goals scored by i \u2013 goals scored by j, taken over both matches \n \nHowever, league positions are determined not by goals but by points. It is not \nuncommon that a team, once ahead in a match, just protects that lead by \nplaying the rest of the game defensively. There arise occasionally situations \nin which teams may have the same number of points and so, at either end of \nthe league, goal difference is important, but these are infrequent. In \nrecognition of this primacy of points we may prefer a measure of the \ndifference in performance  based on points rather than goals:  \n \npij  =  points scored by i \u2013 points scored by j, taken over both matches \n \n \nA network-based measure \n \nAny network can be made into a symmetrical binary network, X, by setting \n \n xij  =  1 if  |gij| \u2264 \u03b1    ;  \u03b1>0      (1) \n       =  0 otherwise   \n \nand similarly for pij. In what follows it is convenient also to set  \n \n 9\n xii  =  1  ;    \u2200 i \n \nX then indicates pairs of teams whose performances are practically \nindistinguishable according to the parameter \u03b1. \n \nWe may group pairs of teams into blocks which are maximally dense: \n \nxij  =  1 for all pairs i,j in the same block \n \nFor instance, if teams a and b and c constitute a block then a is similar to b, b \nis similar to c and a is similar to c and each of these three similarities have to \nbe established explicitly; there is no commutative effect whereby the first two \nimply the third. \n \nThe number, B, of these maximally dense blocks which it is possible to \nconstruct gives a measure of the competitiveness in the league. The smaller \nthe number of blocks the more competitive the league: in the extreme, if B = \n1 then it is impossible to distinguish the performance of any of the teams and \nthe league is maximally competitive, while if B = 20 then no blocking is \npossible and the league is minimally competitive, each team is distinguished \nfrom all others. \n \nFollowing the general approach adopted by Jessop (2003) define a \nmembership matrix \u039b in which the binary variable \u03bbik = 1 if team i is in block \nk and 0 if it is not. Since each team may be in only one block,  \n 10\n  \u2211 \u03bbik  =  1    ;    \u2200 i       (2) \n  k   \n \nBlock k comprises sk teams where \n \n sk  =  \u2211 \u03bbik  ;    \u2200 k       (3) \n           i \n \nSince each block must be a maximal density block we have \n \n \u2211\u2211 xij\u03bbik\u03bbjk  =  sk2  =  (\u2211 \u03bbik )2  ;  \u2200 k    (4)  \n  i  j                                 i \n \nFinding block membership involves solutions for \u039b which are in some sense \noptimal but the formulation in (4) leads to an integer quadratic programme in \nwhich only local optima will be found. Reformulation as an integer linear \nprogramme leads to globally optimal solutions but at the expense of an \nincreased problem size (though this increase may be mitigated by exploiting \nthe symmetry of the problem and computing using only half matrices).  \nIntroduce the three dimensional matrix \u03a6 such that \n \n \u03c6ijk  =  \u03bbik\u03bbjk               (5) \n \nwhich can be achieved via the constraints \n \n \u03c6ijk  \u2264  \u03bbik   \n \n \u03c6ijk  \u2264  \u03bbjk               (6) \n 11\n      \n \u03c6ijk  \u2265  \u03bbik + \u03bbjk  - 1      \n \nso that (4) becomes: \n \n\u2211 \u2211 \u03c6ijkxij   =   \u2211 \u2211 \u03c6ijk  ;    \u2200 k   (7)  \n             i   j                    i   j \n \nTo find the minimum number of maximum density blocks introduce the \nvector \u0393 of binary variables \u03b3k which have value 0 if block k is empty and 1 \notherwise. Ensure this by the constraints \n \n \u03b3k  \u2264  sk  =  \u2211 \u03bbik  ;    \u2200 k      (8) \n                    i \n \nand Q.\u03b3k  \u2265  sk  =  \u2211 \u03bbik  ;    \u2200 k     (9) \n                                    i \n \nwhere Q is a number large in the context of the problem: Q = 100 was used. \n \nSet the matrices \u039b and \u0393 to have dimensions i = 1 \u202620 and k = 1\u2026B \u2264 20 \nand then solve the programme \n \nmin  \u2211 \u03b3k          (10)                          \n                 k     \n \nsubject to constraints (2), (6), (7), (8) and (9). The result is the minimum \nnumber, Bmin, of non-empty blocks. \n             \n 12\nIn general the solution is not unique: there may be more than one blocking \npattern for any Bmin. This is unimportant if the purpose of the analysis is to \nuse Bmin as a measure of competitiveness but is important if we also wish to \nidentify which teams comprise the blocks. There is another consideration. \nJust as we define the density of the network to be \n \n D  =  \u2211\u2211 xij \/ 202       (11) \n           i  j                           \n \nwe may also define the proportion of links which are accounted for by the \nblock structure as \n \n A  =  \u2211 sk2 \/ \u2211\u2211 xij        (12) \n          k          i  j          \n \nthe numerator being just the number of links in all Bmin blocks. It is natural to \nwish to maximise A and this can be done via the programme \n \n max  S  =  \u2211 sk2  =  \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u03c6ijk       (13)  \n                   k             k   i    j             \n \nsubject to (2), (6) and (7). The number of blocks for the summation of k is set \nto Bmin as determined by the previous model. S is a measure of concentration \nin that it reflects the allocation of the nodes into (maximum density) blocks, \nhigher values of S corresponding to the presence of larger blocks. (Although \nargued from a slightly different standpoint this is formally the same as the \nmeasure of industrial concentration due to Herfindahl (1950) and Hirschman \n(1964) as applied to the problem of blockmodel construction by Jessop \n 13\n(2003).) Again, the solution may not be unique, although the number of \noptimal solutions will be smaller, of course.  \n \nAs well as the pairwise relations X there may be other measures which \ncharacterise the relative fortunes of two teams; the difference in their final \nleague positions, for instance. Given such a measure, say qi for team i, then yij \n= |qi \u2013 qj| is a measure of distance between pairs of teams. Given two or more \nblock structures with the optimal value Smax one may be preferred if the \nconstituents of blocks exhibit greater compactness in that teams in each block \nare in aggregate closer according to Y. We may, in other words, prefer a \nstructure which results from the programme \n \nmin  C  =  \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u03c6ijkyij          (14)  \n                              k   i    j             \n \nsubject to \n \n  \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u03c6ijk  =  Smax      (15)  \n               k   i    j             \n \nand also subject to (2), (6) and (7) as before. \n \nThree models have been described: \n \n(a) min B provides a good first descriptor and, importantly, provides a \nvalue for Bmin which permits much reduced computing time for \n(b) and (c) below;  \n 14\n (b) max S describes the aggregation into maximum density blocks and so \nthe proportion of interactions accounted for by the blocking; \n \n(c) min C provides an improved set of block memberships and so is only \nuseful if this is of interest, since nothing is added to the systemic \ndescription provided by Bmin and Smax. \n \n \nApplication and results \n \n \nSystem description \n \nThree binary networks are defined; one based on goal difference and two on \npoints. Because of the infrequency of high scoring matches (Table 1, line 3) a \nmodest goal difference was used, teams being deemed similar if the goal \ndifference, over both matches, was no more than 1. \n \nThe absolute value of the points difference across two matches can be either \n0, 3 or 6. The first two were used. A points difference of 0 arises when either \nboth matches are drawn or each team wins one match. A difference of at most \n3 points arises in all cases except where one team wins both matches. The \nthree networks are  \n \n 15\n xij   =  1 if  |gij|  \u2264  1 the goals network    (16) \n       =  1 if  |pij|  =  0 the 0points network    (17) \n       =  1 if  |pij|  \u2264  3 the 3points network    (18) \n \n       =  0 otherwise \n \nAs illustration, Figure 2 shows an application to the results for the 2000 \nseason. Figure 2(a) shows the results for each match. Figure 2(b) shows the \nbinary 0points network. A 1 in the table show where each of a pair of teams \ngained the same number of points from their two matches. Figure 2(c) shows \nthe effect of the blockmodel which is essentially a reordering of rows and \ncolumns to give the blocks as maximum density squares along the diagonal. \nThe densities of the off-diagonal elements measure the interaction or \nconnectedness between the blocks. For some applications a further \nhierarchical clustering of blocks using these inter-block densities may be \nhelpful. This was not judged to be the case here since it is the systemic \ndescription provided by the blocks themselves which is the main concern. \n \nTable 1 shows the results of applying the models. The densities of each type \nof network do not change much: the goals model accounts for about half the \nmatches played; the 0points model for about a third and the 3points model for \nabout three quarters. \n \nThe minimum numbers of blocks does not alter much, although with the \n0points model there is a small increase in the number of blocks over time. As \n 16\nis to be expected, the number of blocks is smaller the greater the network \ndensity. \n \nThe proportion of the links accounted for by the blocks, A, initially varies but \nover time appears to converge to a similar value of about 0.4 for all three \nmodels. This is further discussed below. \n \nTeam performance \n \nThe above describe the structural properties of the competitive system. Do the \nblock structures correlate with the results for individual teams?  \n \nIn minimising C we choose to use the points difference between teams as a \nmeasure of compactness. Table 2 shows the results for the 0points network. \nPoints achieved rather than team names are shown. Blocks are arranged in \ndescending order of mean points score per block. Within each block points \nare listed in descending order. \n \nA measure of the extent to which the order as presented is different from that \nbased on unblocked points is given by computing Spearman's rank correlation \ncoefficient, rs, between the orderings such as those given in Table 2 and the \nfinal league positions.  The degree to which the blocking alters the ranking \nwill depend in part on the number of blocks. Because of this it is probably \nonly sensible to compare coefficient values for each network in turn (the \nnumber of blocks varying only a little), rather than between networks. It \n 17\nought also to be borne in mind that the differences in block means are not \nalways great. However, values of rs do give an indication of blocking effects \n(Table 1). Figure 3 shows two illustrative examples to assist in the \ninterpretation of rs. High values of rs indicate that similarly performing teams \nare in the same block whereas low values and so may be seen to indicate \nmore unexpected (and so entertaining?) results.  \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nBlockmodels have been presented as a description of the results of a league \ncompetition. The results may be considered at two levels; at the level of \nstructural description and at the level of team performance. In considering \nthese it must be remembered that block structures are not necessarily unique: \nthere may be more than one partitioning of teams into blocks that gives the \nsame distribution of block sizes corresponding to a given minimum number \nof blocks or maximum value of S. At the level of structural description the \nexistence of multiple optima is of no concern.  \n \nIn describing structure two parameters are used in finding blocks. The first is \nthe performance measure used and the second is the cut value \u03b1 (1).  Three \ncombinations were used ((16) to (18)) resulting in corresponding criteria and \nbinary networks. Because it is points rather than goal differences which \ndetermine so many issues important to the clubs the measures based on points \nare preferred. Network density (the fraction of matches with results meeting \n 18\nthe criterion) is, of course, different depending upon the network used, \nranging from about 30% to about 75%. These densities do not change much \nover time. Although the different networks are of different densities the \ndegree to which the interactions are accounted for by the blockmodels, A, is \nroughly constant for each network. This may be due to a characteristic \ninherent in the game. \nWesson (2002) makes the point that soccer is, by design or otherwise, a low \nscoring game (for the matches studied here the mean number of goals per \ngame is about 2.6) and that as a consequence the result of any match is not \nvery predictable. This is a function of the rules which govern the conduct of \neach match, the fact that it is in the end points and not goals which matter and \nso the defence of a narrow advantage, and, as in any such sport, the physical \nopposition of two teams resulting in an Ashby-like mutual regulation (\"If  you \nwant to contain the behaviour of twelve people in red shirts running madly all \nover a football field, you will need at least twelve men in white shirts to do it. \n(Beer, 1975)) \nThe argument is effectively one of small sample size: if the number of goals \nper match were higher then the abilities of the superior (more skilled and \nbetter organised) team would more often lead to the defeat of lesser teams. \nAlthough the binary networks here are formed by the aggregation of home \nand away results this hardly represents a great increase in sample size. In the \nextreme, the result of each match may be determined randomly, which is to \nsay without regard to the skills or strengths of the teams involved. Figure 4 \nshows that this might well be so. For each of the three network types twenty \n 19\nrandom binary networks were constructed with probabilities of 0.33, 0.5 and \n0.75, which are the average network densities for the networks. Each link was \nassigned a random number. If this was less than the characteristic probability \nthe link was actuated; xij=1. The results are shown together with the results \nfor the nine seasons of the Premiership. At the extremes of density only one \nconfiguration is possible: when D=1 all possible links are realised and there is \njust one block, while if D=1\/n (n is the number of nodes) there are just n \nsingletons. In both cases A=1. For intermediate densities the number of \npossible configurations, and so the possible range of A, is higher. \n \nTwo features of Figure 4 are worth noting: first, that there is a quite  wide \nspread of A values for any density and, second, that the actual results are \nindistinguishable from those of the simulated random networks. In \nconsequence we may believe that the lower bound for A as indicated by the \nrandom networks is not sharply defined and that the results obtained from the \nfootball networks  lie in that region. \n \nThe similarity of the results for the random and football networks is an initial \nindication that the structure in football league results, considered as pairs of \nmatches, is at best weak.  \n \nHowever, the indications provided by the rank correlation measures are that \nthere is some correspondence between block membership and seasonal \nperformance as shown by the final points total. This total is based on the \naggregation of the results of 38 matches and so should be a quite good \n 20\nindicator of underlying relative team performance. The correspondence \nbetween block membership and points obtained were reasonably high: rs>0.7 \nfor 14 of the 27 results and rs>0.5 for 24. To the extent that the correlations \nare nor perfect it may be inferred that some unexpected results are to be found \nand this is to be welcomed as an indicator,  albeit a crude indicator, of the \nentertainment value of the matches throughout the season. \n \nThis is an apparently paradoxical result: that meaningful groups can be found \nin data even though the foundation for the construction of those groups is \nweak. One interpretation is that this demonstrates the power of the \naggregation of 38 results into overall points when compared with the \naggregation over just two games to form networks. In addition, recall the \nrelation between the max S and min C models. Because of the weak network \nstructure there are likely to be a number of possible patterns of block \nmembership which are consistent with the value of Smax. The pattern found in \nthe optimisation will depend in part on the implementation of the algorithm in \nthe software and is to that extent arbitrary. Minimising C was introduced as a \nmeans of finding a particular solution for Smax. It is not possible to assess the \nimpact of the min C criterion by examining the reduction of C consequent \nupon its introduction because of the arbitrariness mentioned above. As an \nalternative consider the change in S (and so in A) of dropping from the min C \nmodel the constraint that S=Smax. The results are shown in Table 1 as the last \nline in each section. The reduction is usually no more than 10%. This \ndifference may be seen as an indication that imposing the S=Smax constraint \n 21\ngives a modest but perceptible improvement in S indicating the existence of \nsome structure in the network. \n \nThe existence of a weak structure at this level is consistent with attempts \nmade to forecast match outcomes. Croucher (2004) used two Poisson models \nthe parameters of which were the mean number of goals per match scored at \nhome and away by all teams in the league. Match results were then forecast \nassuming independence of the performance of the two teams (ie.using just the \nproduct of the two Poisson probabilities). It was concluded that while this \ngave reasonable results in some cases the assumption of independence was \nunsustainable (see also Dobson and Goddard, 2004) and that there was some \ninteraction between teams. It is the interactions between team pairs which is \nthe basis for the network models, though the characterisation of the results in \nthe random networks is not so fine as that provided by the two Poisson \nmodel. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe feasibility of constructing blockmodels as descriptors of league \nperformance has been demonstrated. \n \nBlock structures do not vary significantly over time. This may be because \ntheir characteristics are similar to those of random networks of the same \n 22\ndensity and that it is this comparatively weak structure which, getting no \nstronger, is at least stable. \n \nThis similarity to random networks may be inherent in the game of soccer, in \nparticular as a consequence of the low scoring rate. While this helps to \nprovide agreeably unexpected results it also means that at the level of team \npairs little overall structure can be determined.  \n \nMeaningful identification of the teams in each block is possible. To quite a \ngood degree block membership is related to team strength as measured by \naggregate points totals. The small change in S which results from relaxing the \nrequirement that S=Smax reinforces the view that while some structure exists \nin the network it is not great. \n \nThe Barclays Premiership has enough structure to ensure that over a season \nthe better teams succeed and the poorer teams are relegated but, at the \nnetwork level of matches, a much weaker structure so that the outcomes are \nsufficiently uncertain that entertainment is maintained. The stronger \nconclusion is that the networks have characteristics indistinguishable from \nthose of random networks and so exhibit no structure at all and so no \ninformation is useful once network density is known. That blocks may be \nconstructed in which a non-trivial relation exists between block membership \nand points total indicates that the stronger conclusion is too strong and that \nsome further investigation may be worthwhile. \n \n 23\nThese investigations into league structure have usefully been made using the \nnetwork models developed. \n \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nI should like to thank Dr Les Proll of the University of Leeds for helpful \ndiscussion on the LP formulation of the blockmodel. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBeer S (1975).
