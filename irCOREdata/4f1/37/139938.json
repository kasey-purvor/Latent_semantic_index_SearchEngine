INTRODUCTION\nFibre Bragg grating sensors are fast becoming a key technology for use in a wide variety of structural strain monitoring\napplications\"2. The majority of interrogation techniques used for this application area are based on illuminating an array of\nFBG's using a source with a large spectral bandwidth, typically several tens of nanometers. Wavelength-division-\nmultiplexing (WDM) techniques are then used to measure the wavelength of light returned from each grating3. This\ntechnique works well for limited grating numbers; typically \u201410 sensors can be unambiguously monitored if each sensor has\na range of 5OOO.tm\/m. Additional sensors can be addressed by incorporating time-division-multiplexing (TDM)4'5 and\/or\nspatial-division-multiplexing. In both cases the individual sensor bandwidth is generally restricted to a maximum of a few\nhundred Hz. The limited optical power available per sensor also limits the sensor bandwidth by limiting the signal to noise\nratio available. An alternative approach, that has had limited practical demonstration to date, is to interrogate the FBG's with\na laser source. Now the source spectral width is much narrower then the FBG such that a change in the centre wavelength of\nthe FBG causes a change in the intensity of the reflected light. Although intensity sensors have relatively low dynamic range\n(102 1O) in comparison to interferometric and wavelength based techniques, their performance is adequate for many\nengineering applications. When laser interrogation is used arrays of FBG's need to be fabricated with near identical centre\nwavelengths and with low reflectivities to minimise crosstalk and ensure sufficient light reaches the furthest gratings in the\narray. ThM of identical arrays has been proposed5 and recently demonstrated4. 1DM is appropriate for gratings that are\nseparated by several meters of fibre and\/or have unequal physical separations. However, high speed detection and processing\nelectronics are required which decrease the signal to noise performance.\nIn this paper we propose and demonstrate an alternative laser based interrogation technique based on frequency-division-\nmultiplexing (FDM). In this method each FBG sensor forms one \"mirror\" in a path length imbalanced interferometer. The\ninterferometer is illuminated with a single frequency laser source and pseudo-heterodyne signal processing implemented via\nmodulation of the laser output wavelength. The phase of the carrier generated is dependent on the FBG and the\nenvironmental perturbations on both fibre arms of the interferometer. However, the amplitude of the carrier is primarily\ndependent upon the amount of light reflected from the FBG. Arrays of gratings with different optical path length imbalances\ncan be formed, producing a range of carrier frequencies, which can be electronically demultiplexed. These FBG arrays form\ninterferometers within interferometers or nested interferometers as they have recently been termed6. The nested\ninterferometer arrangements described in reference 6 differ from the technique described here in that WDM is used and the\nFBGs are used to define the sensor region butdo not themselves act as sensors.\nFurther author information-\nR.

Background\n2. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\nFigure 1 shows schematically the difference in interrogation of a Bragg grating by a source with a spectral range that is\nbroad compared to the optical bandwidth of the FBG and a source with a spectral range much smaller then the FBG\nbandwidth. Figure la shows that if the FBG centre wavelength changes, due to strain or temperature changes for example,\nthe FBG will reflect light of a slightly different wavelength. There may also be a change in the reflected intensity dependent\nupon the source spectral profile and position of the FBG wavelength in the source spectrum. In figure lb the reflected\nwavelength remains the same as the FBG wavelength moves but the reflected intensity changes.\nFigure la: Schematic illustrating a\nbroad bandwidth source illuminating a narrow\nbandwidth FBG\n2.2. Single Sensor Interrogation\nFigure ib: Schematic illustrating a narrow\nbandwidth source illuminating a broad\nbandwidth FBG\nIncorporating this effect into an interferometric interrogation technique can be understood by reference to figure 2. The\noptical configuration shown is a simple fibre optic Michelson interferometer formed using a directional coupler. The\n\"mirrors\" are formed by a FBG and a mirror, or a second FBG.\nSourc%.\nFBG\nDetector\nIII I\nMirror\nor FBG\nFigure 2: Optical Fibre Michelson Interferometer\nwith a FBG mirror\nThis interferometer configuration behaves in a similar way to one formed using two conventional mirrors, that is, any\nperturbation of the fibre forming the interferometer causes a concomitant change in the interferometer phase. However, a\nchange in the centre wavelength of the FBG causes an additional phase change and a change in the intensity of the returned\nsignal. This can be seen by considering the transfer function of a two-beam interferometer:\n267\nI I\nSource\nGrating\n+\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 09 Feb 2011 to 138.250.84.47.

The amplitude of the fringes can be calculated from the difference between\nthe maximum and minimum interferometer output levels. Figure 3 shows the variation of this value as a function of the ratio\nof signal to reference intensity. As the intensity of the optical power returning from the grating increases, the photodetector\noutput increases. The transfer function is, in general, nonlinear. However, there are regions that are approximately linear. In\naddition it is possible to calibrate the sensor output to correct for the non-linearity. The transfer function has a steeper\ngradient for low values of 12111, i.e. indicating potentially higher sensitivity for low reflectivity gratings.\n2.0\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nE 0.2\n0.2 0.4\n'2' Ii\n0.6\n'2\/Il\n0.1\n0.8 1.0\nFigure 3: Fringe amplitude (Imax - 1mm) plotted against the intensity ratio ('2 IIl)\nInset: Enlarged region '2 II =0 to 0.1\n2.3. Signal Processing and Multiplexing\nTo distinguish phase changes from intensity changes requires some form of signal processing technique. Since we are\ninterested in exploring the potential of the technique for addressing an array of sensors the signal processing method should\nenable multiplexing of the sensors. The method we propose here is FMCW which uses wavelength modulation of the source\ncombined with an imbalance in the optical paths between the two interferometer arms to generate a different carrier\n268\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 09 Feb 2011 to 138.250.84.47.

The phase change, Ap, in the interferometer due to an optical frequency change\nLXV, is given by\n2itALzv\nL(p= (3)C\nwhere AL is the optical path length imbalance and c is the free space speed of light. For a particular i\\L, tp can be arranged\nto be a multiple of 2ic by adjusting Av appropriately9\"0.\nModulation of the injection current of the laser with a serrodyne (sawtooth) waveform causes a linear change of the emission\nwavelength and a concomitant linear change in phase of the interferometer. Electrical bandpass filtering can be used to\nremove the higher frequencies associated with the ramp to produce a pseudo-heterodyne carrier.\nAll FBG's within the FDM array are written at the same central wavelength. Multiple reflections between FBG's will\ncontribute to the carrier frequency amplitude unless careful consideration is given to the sensor array topology11. To reduce\nthis crosstalk component, the optical path difference between any sensor and the reference arm mirror must be different from\nthe physical separation of any two FBG's within the array. This is achieved as shown in figure 4 where all the FBG's are\nseparated by equal optical path lengths. Here the optical path length in the reference arm is arranged to be equal to the\noptical path length to the grating B +2\/3 of the length to grating C. The shortest path length imbalance in the array of\ninterferometers is formed by the mirror and grating C. The amplitude of the injection current modulation is adjusted to\nproduce 6ic radians phase change for a path length imbalance of 3m, equivalent to 3 fringes. FBG B has an optical path\nlength difference which produces a phase change of 4ic radians, equivalent to 2 fringes. In a similar way FBG A produces 5\nfringes and FBG D and E produce 4 and 7 fringes respectively. Multiple reflections between pairs of gratings give rise to\nfrequency components at multiples of 3 fringes and can therefore be separated from the individual grating signals. The\nlength of the reference arm of the interferometer can be chosen such that the balance point lies assymmetrically between any\npair of gratings. Locating the balance position near the central array halves the maximum optical path length, hence reducing\nthe laser phase noise component by minimising the longest optical path length imbalance.\nFigure 4.

A function\ngenerator was used to apply a 3kHz serrodyne modulation frequency to the injection current. The current modulation was\n1.2mA giving rise to 3GHz (O.OO7nm) modulation; the laser characteristics were measured to be 2.5GHzJmA using a\nconfocal Fabry-Perot interferometer. The signal detected at the photodiode was electronically band-pass filtered and the\namplitude of the carrier was measured on an oscilloscope. The fringe visibility was maximised by using a quarter wave plate\nin one arm of the interferometer to match the polarisation states of the signals before mixing. The FBG was mounted on a\npiezoelectrically controlled translation stage capable of applying \u20141OOOim\/m across the sensor.\nPZT Controller\nFigure 5: Experimental arrangement for single sensor configuration.\nFG =Function generator, LD =Laserdiode, OSC =Oscilloscope, SA = Spectrum analyser, PC = Personal computer,\nI = Isolator, S = Splice, M = Mirror, BPF =Band pass filter.\n3.2.

The\nlaser output was monitored with a monochromator; although the monochromator output was time averaged no mode hopping\nwas visible even over several hours of observation. A Fabry Perot etalon was incorporated into the system to monitor the\nlaser stability during the experiment. Two of the three gratings were mounted onto PZT controlled translation stages.

The high frequency flyback component is\nevident in this waveform but, when filtered out, would produce a pure 9kHz carrier signal. Straining gratings 1 & 2 away\nfrom the interrogation wavelength enables isolation of the response of FBG G3, which is shown in figure 12c. The optical\nimbalance to the third FBG, G3, was set to give a 24kHz signal. It is clear from the trace shown that 8 fringes were produced\nby the system, thus proving the imbalance was correct. A slight modulation of the fringe amplitude is evident below the\n24kHz signal. This is primarily due to remaining contributions from the other two FBG. Superposition of the noise and\ngrating signals is demonstrated in figure 12d which shows a typical response from the system before frequency separation.\nGi G2 G3MR 'MR\n0.016 $\n0.014\n:\n0.012 $\n0.01 : I\n0.008\n: I\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n\u2014 \u2014\nFigure ha\nF I kHz\nFigure lhb\nF I kHz\n-\n!!\nit 1LJLI\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.035\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\nFigure 12a\nFigure 12b\nFigure 12c\nFigure 12d\n. : Figure lic\nI Frequency \/z15 18 21 243 6 9 12 Time\/ms 0\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 09 Feb 2011 to 138.250.84.47.

Although the FBG reflectivities are equal, figure 1 ic shows a slight decrease in reflected intensity with\nposition in the array. This is due to the intensity of the reflected optical power from each successive FBG being reduced by\nthe transmission losses of the preceding FBG's within the array. Figure 1 lb shows the frequency spectrum of the system with\nstrain applied to FBG G2. Relative changes in intensity can be seen as well as a marked increase in all the intensity values.\nThe general rise at all frequencies is due to the increased reflection from the FBG array. Additionally the sensor arm noise\nsignal is increased as more multiple reflections are produced. Figure 1 la shows the difference in optical intensity resultant\nfrom the applied strain. The 15kHz signal, characteristic of FBG G2 optical path difference demonstrates the largest\nintensity increase. This is due to the reflectivity increase in response to applied strain. Increased response from FBG Gi at\n6kHz is due to increased power levels in the system and the associated intensity increase in ramp harmonic signals. The FBG\nG3 response at 24kHz is increased the least as lower optical power levels are now transmitted through to it or received back\nfrom it. If equal optical intensities were incident on gratings 1 and 3, their responses would be identical.\n5. DISCUSSION\nThe 35O.tm\/m sensing range was limited by the grating bandwidth of -O.2nm. The range could be improved by using a\ngrating with a broad spectrum or a linear discriminator grating formed by an apodised chirped FBG'3. These are available\nwith linear slopes of up to lO-2Onm implying a potential strain range up to 20000pni\/m.\nThe novel topology used in this system allowed much of the multiple reflection crosstalk noise to be filtered out, reducing\nthe crosstalk noise floor. Power budget calculations were carried out for a crosstalk noise limited system, with no additional\nnoise sources taken into account. A serial array of up to 25 FBG's written with reflectivities of 1% would be possible. Above\nthis the crosstalk signal would become as large as the reflected signal from the last FBG in the array. By reducing the\nreflectivity to 0. 1 %, this would rise to a 500 sensor maximum. Comparison was made of two 1 0 sensor arrays, one\ncontaining FBG's written at identical reflectivities, the other composed of FBG's written with decreasing reflectivity\nvalues14. Taking the crosstalk noise values (C\/N) for the tenth sensor in the array i.e.sensor of highest loss: the decreasing\nreflectivities system would give C\/N of 12.49dB, equivalent to 100 FBG's using the like reflectivities system. Ten identical\nsensors of 1% reflectivity in the latter system produced C\/N of only 24.35dB which increased to 44.43dB for 0.1%\nreflectivities. FBG' s with equal reflectivity, therefore, proved to be the superior system, as well as being far less complex to\nmanufacture.\nThe nonlinear response of system intensity to strain application, shown in figure 3, was not accounted for in the results as the\nregion of the curve which the data was recorded over closely approximated a linear response. Increased resolution is\npossible by calculating the sensor response for the non-linear transfer function. It has been shown that lower reflectivity\nFBG's increase the sensitivity of the system. The inset to figure 3 exhibits a similar transfer function with increased gradient\nfor lower reflectivity values. Combined with the results from the crosstalk analysis, this response shows that low reflectivity\nFBG's can reduce crosstalk and increase system strain resolution.\nDiode modulation frequencies up to several tens of GHz are possible which would enable sensing of AC measurands up into\nultrasonic regimes. Further work is now being carried out to combine the FDM with WDM techniques in order to increase\nthe number of sensors which could be interrogated for the same crosstalk limits. Unlike alternative systems involving ThM\ntechniques, sensor separations can remain relatively short, reducing lead length and its associated noise components. In\naddition, no high speed electronics are required in the FDM system, a limiting factor in most 1DM arrangements.\nThe use of birefreingent optical fibre will be required in multiplexed arrays to ensure consistent matching of the polarisation\nstates.\nThe technique has the potential to be extended to measure the phase of each nested interferometer, that is, to provide\nmeasurand information integrated along the optical fibre between gratings in a similar manner to that reported in reference 6.\nThe difference with this technique is that all the gratings have the same centre wavelength. Extending the techniques\nreported in this paper to provide distributed and localised information is currently under investigation.\n273\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 09 Feb 2011 to 138.250.84.47.
