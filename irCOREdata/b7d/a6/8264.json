Racoon, beaver, bear, fox, lynx, mink, otter, wolf, ermine \u2013 such exquisite \nbeauty renders the excruciating pain somehow poetic\u2026  \n \nFor the farmed creatures, their sacrificial \u2018snuff\u2019 is the sanity-shattering cage-slam, \nincarceration breeding intolerable distress: repeated baying, pacing, twitching until \nthe petit mort of anal\/vaginal electrocution, of asphyxiation or poisoning, of pressing, \nstrangling, stamping, bludgeoning, or the heightened ecstasy of being skinned alive\u2026   \n \n \nAvoidance of death-marks on the fetish-fabric of the fur is vital, allowing the \ndisavowal needed by fetish-purists who seek the idealised and non-bodily material \npleasure of a \u2018fur experience\u2019. This paper asserts that it is the heady mix of sex, \nsadism, seduction and sensuality that keeps fur both perennially attractive and \nascendant in the fashion industry, and connects it powerfully to the production and \nconsumption of the most notorious and unsavory of pornography: \u2018snuff\u2019. Snuff, as a \nverb, means to extinguish, douse, smother, choke, blow out, quench, and it is used \ninformally as replacement for \u2018kill\u2019 (first coined in Ed Sander\u2019s The Family, based on \nCharles Manson\u2019s story, the word was employed subsequently in the Findlay partners\u2019 \ncommercial film Snuff, released in 1976 shortly after the US confiscation of several \nSouth American underground films containing footage of women apparently killed on \ncamera and during climactic sexual action). Such filmic \u2018snuff\u2019 violently discloses the \nbody and its private parts, negating the disavowal of fetishism by insisting that its gift \nis essentially overt, violent and real. Somewhere within a territory of perversity, \ninformed and troubled by definitions and corruptions of fetishism and sadism, \nhowever, fur dynamically co-joins the fetishistic disavowing pleasure of its rich surface \nwith the overt deliberateness of suffering at its point of production (in turn informing \nits moment of consumption, where arguably it activates commodity fetishism again). \nFur fabric manages to perform this oscillation between the disclaimer of the fur \nfetishist and the de-fetishized knowingness of the fur sadist, corrupting both in its \ninsinuation that the deep and complex perversion of Western fur appreciation \u2013 \ncertainly post-1980s PETA \u2013 lies in the fetishist\u2019s obverse acceptance of the \u2018attraction \nof repulsion\u2019, the inversion of the traditional male fetishist in the legions of fur-\nwearing femme fatales, and the Sapphic implications of such femmes\u2019 somatic \ninsertion into the fur that still is inflected as female genitalia\u2026    \n \nWith this potent oscillation in mind, the embodied nature of fur, its origin as a soft \ncover for a (once) living creature, arguably positions it as an essentially deathly fabric. \nIs it possible now to escape the ecstatic pleasure of the stroke of soft pelt passing \nacross one\u2019s skin, or avoid the knowing acceptance of agony, to disavow desire for the \nsex-death nexus, or to critically subordinate emotion and empathy in making or taking \nfur? Fur, I contend, provides the true \u2018stuff of snuff\u2019, allowing what Linda Williams calls \nin relation to hard-core pornography \u201cthe perverse substitute of death spasm for \npleasure spasm: the replacement of orgasm\u2019s \u2018little death\u2019 by real death\u201d (Williams \n1990:192). My contention is that it is the actual deaths of fur\u2019s birth that creates in \nfur the sheath-space of heightened pleasure for the sadist-fetishist (the former \nlooking directly at the slit-skin, the latter seeing no death-marks and choosing to \ndisavow in spite of what is seen. It is then the absence of death that makes even the \nextreme fineness of the best of micro fibres nothing other than a poor and sterile \nsubstitute for the \u2018real snuff\u2019.  \n \nThe anti-fur campaigns of the 1980s and since have left Western consumers in no \ndoubt as to where fur comes from, how it is obtained, who consumes it, and what the \ndishonourable cultural penalty might be of wearing it (Emberley 1998:21-42; Quan \n1998:1; Hoffmann 2006). The environmental, social and trans-cultural, economic, \ngender-related, post-colonial and neo-imperialist aspects of fur production, trade and \nconsumption are not the focus of this paper, and they are amply covered elsewhere. \nIt is not necessary here, for example, to review the English \u2018sumptuary laws\u2019 of the \nfourteenth to early seventeenth century, their restriction on all kinds of perceived \nexcess including the wearing of fur apparel (by those of lesser social rank than the \nhigher nobility), and their functions to preserve class distinction and privileged social \norder, regulate luxury and extravagance for moral purpose, and to encourage frugality \nand industry in the lower classes to support those in the upper classes (Emberley \n1998:8-9,43-44). Nevertheless, the tension between hedonism and restraint (Baldwin \n1926:10 in Emberley 1998:44), or critique versus practice of excess (Bourdieu 1984: \n24), illuminated by these laws in some way previews the pro-fur and anti-fur rhetorics \nof the late twentieth century wherein fur fashionistas accused the anti-fur lobby of \n\u201cself-righteousness and ecological Puritanism\u201d (Bolton 2005:68; Quan 1998:2), while \nthe anti-fur lobby counter-charged fur advocacy as decadent and selfish to the point \nof wilful cruelty and ecological destruction (Nadeau 2001:177). Specifically, it is what \nEmberley calls fur\u2019s role as both a \u201clibidinal fetish\u201d and a \u201ccomplex sign of political, \npoetic and \u2026 erotic power\u201d (1998:4) that is central to this paper\u2019s argument. In these \nwords, fur\u2019s dynamic magic is captured, and its potency as a sexual signifier of great \nintricacy is established. The anti-fur campaigns that told us \u201cIt takes up to 40 dumb \nanimals to make a fur coat. But only one to wear it\u201d (Lynx 1984), and the like, missed \nthe point of fur ethics entirely. As Skov (2004:24) notes, in spite of the vehemence of \nsuch opposition, and in spite of the now familiar tales of terror of how fur arrives on \nthe high street, \u201cthe erotically charged entwinement of fur, beauty and pain has \nsurvived\u201d. Understanding and accepting that entwinement as shifting between denial \nand celebration of the perversions (fetishism on one hand, sadism on the other) of fur \nliberates us then to consider our principled position in relation to it. \n \nFur is sex, it is transgressive, it is perverse, it is about climactic dominance and it is \nabout death, it does conjure the magnetism and dynamism of sadomasochistic sexual \npractice. And, in parallel, it perversely disavows all this to be purely about the fetish-\nfur-iness of itself and its breath-taking affect. If fur-wearing lovers of fur know their \nbreach of the codes of compassion and the ethics of endearment (and even the most \ndisavowing fetishists must), then any punishment experienced at the hands of PETA \nactivists only liberates their enjoyment of fur\u2019s purity and perversity. Williams argues \nin this vein within the complex and shifting expressions of the sadomasochistic \nscenario, but her sentiment \u2013 that punishment thus \u201cserves a function: it absolves the \nsupposedly desireless woman of responsibility and blame for pleasures she \nnevertheless enjoys\u201d (1990:213) \u2013 is arguably applicable to the fur-wearing woman \nwho deals with punitive activist scorn and strides onwards, fur-clad and bold, \npropelled by her conviction in North\u2019s \u201curge to extravagance\u201d (1999:unpaginated). As \na lone fetishist, she is more unusual in her gender; as a sadist, however, she finds a \nnumber of phallicized female fur-fellows with whom to stride. The depth of the \npleasure and power combination contained in the wearing of fur for such women is so \ngreat that no form of societal or cultural censure deflects it. It is effectively a \nsadomasochistic bond, rather than a strictly fetishistic one, with all the mobility of \nidentification that such SM bonds allow. As such, it echoes the intensity of the slow \ncoital strangulation of Kichi by the phallic female Sada in Oshima\u2019s film In the Realm \nof the Senses (1976). As there, that \u2018snuff\u2019 is followed by absolute possession \u2013 of the \nstrength of that felt by the wearer for her fur \u2013 when Sada castrates Kichi (literally \n\u2018taking the phallus\u2019, but here death-marked) in what Williams calls \u201can expression of \ntheir mutual desires carried to the limits of life itself\u201d (1990:221). She owns his body \nby the chilling deathly action of her desire and its enactment. So too, the fur-woman \nowns her collection of bodies, represented in the punishingly potent, achingly poetic \nand sensually superior fabric of fur. Its rejection can, I argue, only be then made in \nspite of fur, and as an act of conscious denial of its \u2018pleasure space\u2019, rather than in \nopposition to it\u2026  \n  \nMale fetishist Mockle\u2019s description of his adolescent rite of passage into the \u2018pleasure \nspace\u2019 of fur ownership reads as a long-anticipated and delicious sexual initiation, \ncharged with secrecy, furtiveness, and a particularly intense sense of private \nautoeroticism:  \n \n\u2026two of our female teachers had gorgeous long dark \nmusquash coats \u2026 except the initial contact in the school \nplayground, I had yet to feel a fur\u2026 \n \n\u2026I acquired my first fur shortly before my eighteenth \nbirthday \u2026 I rushed home, smuggling it in past my parents, \nand remember spending much of the rest of the day \ntouching it, stroking it and, I have to admit, being sexually \naroused by it\u2026 \n(Mr Mockle, www.mrmockle.com, accessed 08.11.06). \n \n \nWhile fur\u2019s silky soft handle and cool suppleness ensures the pelt\u2019s material-fetishistic \ncapability for conjuring sexual excitement (Entwistle 2000:191-192), its \u201cpowerful \nerotic appeal\u201d is especially characterised for Mockle and his like by its unique \ncombination of tactile, olfactory and visual stimulation (Steele 1996:143). \nEncountering fur therefore in that sphere becomes a \u2018whole body\u2019 sensual experience, \nand fur\u2019s caress of the body \u2013 both how that privately feels to the wearer and how \nthat outwardly looks to the viewer \u2013 encourages heightened sensation, and invites \u2013 \nsymbolic or actual \u2013 erotic engagement (Hollander 1995:134). The private and \npreserved excitement of a fetishist results from refusal of the pelt\u2019s association with \ndeath, loss, castration, even female genitalia: for the fur fetishist, fur\u2019s touch, sight \nand smell conjure a powerful sensual experience, but I maintain that the whisper of \ndeath is also there to inflame other complex entanglements and to struggle with the \nfetishist\u2019s disavowal through insistence on knowing. That whisper prompts a subtle \nshiver of the necromantic, the necrophilic, the sense of \u2018deaths and maidens\u2019, \nunderpinning the more acceptable, more savoury explanations of fur\u2019s appeal. Thus, \nfur is bodily, and an embodiment of body-ness, and this is key to its position as the \nprimary fabric of desire. Nadeau (2001:8), for example, illuminates her own sensual \nand embodied fur-response as she \u201ccannot help but seeing the feeling of the fur at the \ntips of [her] fingers \u2026 cannot help but feeling the skin that is wearing the fur\u201d. Her \nwords merge her with the animal that once was, revealing that it\u2019s about the purity of \nqualitative indulgence of personal desire, it\u2019s about the pleasurable excess of the \nsensual pelt-touch of purest foxy-fur on bare bold flesh. It\u2019s about gratifying the \ndecadent itch of a want so sexy it\u2019s a rush, the breathy mouth-feel of the slink and \nglide of it, its oil-slick of sex\u2026 And more, it is the stillness of fur\u2019s embodied body that \nis its erotic and deathly beauty. That which once rippled and writhed, is stilled, and by \nforce of action or of consumer will. That (phallic) devouring force, as a sadistic \ninstrument, the convoluted politics of desire acting around it, and the implications of \nthat enactment, require further exposition than mere fetishism allows... \n \nMy grandmother wore four peeled pelts to her Presbyterian kirk.  \n \nThe minks\u2019 beady glass eyes and their tiny hooked claws unnerved the child-me, but \u2013 \nthrough the childish terror that provokes the onset of sexual fetishism \u2013 I ached for \nthe smooth sweep of their long, lustrous bodies, yearned for the lash of their perfect \ntail-whips, and burned for the imagined glamour of a God-fearing woman dripping \nfurs. No foxy vixen she, no Diana, no Dionysian diva or Bacchanalian fur-clad nymph, \nno earthy Amazon: for my grandmother her minks signalled social solidity, a lucky \nmarriage, and distance travelled from birth in a Belfast butcher\u2019s shop. A lover of \nanimals, she hit men for hitting dogs, but neither she nor I \u2013 disavowing class-\nfetishists together \u2013 reflected the connection between suffering hounds and those four \ndead minks. My grandmother was no sex kitten: more a puritanical puppy, an Old \nTestament gal, for whom \u201cthe Lord God made coats of skins, and clothed [Adam and \nEve]\u201d, concealing their shame (Genesis 111: 21). Hence, for her fur was modest and \nbiblical, arguably symptomatic of her religion\u2019s smug operation of a notion of God-\ngiven leadership over lowly beasts. This staunch fur-clad matron was a world away \nsurely from the decadence of the Marquise de Fontenay, attending post-Revolution \nOpera clad only in the skins of tigers (Ewing 1981:100), entirely detached from Walter \nChin\u2019s iconic model in au naturel Galliano fur and flesh-matching undergarments \n(Bolton 2005:74), light years from the Dalmatian-draped archetype of Cruella de Ville, \na key player in fur\u2019s association with \u201chuman greed, extravagance, folly and even sin \n\u2026 the epitome of \u2026 depraved luxury\u201d (Ewing 1981:26). Not my grandmother, surely? \nBut the ties that bind these unlikely protagonists are there, and they are the real ties \nof mink tails, stiffened sinews, coagulated bloodied arteries. I can mobilise \nKonopnicki\u2019s question in relation to my grandmother\u2019s minks, \u201cAm I an accomplice to \nmurder by stroking the softness of animal fur with the tips of my fingers?\u201d I can hear \nmy inner conscience ask am I a sinner for the sexy stirrings the feel of those minks \nelicited from me. I can reflect on Konopnicki\u2019s answer: \u201cI have no remorse and I \nrefuse to renounce the shiver of a body wrapped in fur\u2026\u201d (1995:9 in Nadeau 2001:7).  \n \nRefusal combined with knowing: a potent combination. \n \nImagine, fetish-sadist, being peeled\u2026 \nImagine a heap of carcasses, a peeled racoon raising your bloody dying head to stare \nat a camera, a racoon with gorgeous lashes, blinking but with your poor bleeding \nheart exposed, and your precious pelt flayed off over your head like a jumper... \nOh sweetness, imagine suffering to death\u2026  \n \nOh my love, imagine your poor bleeding heart exposed for me\u2026 \nStrike dear mistress and cure his heart (Velvet Underground Venus in Furs 1966). \n \nBut, look, that racoon \u2013 not you, my heart \u2013 was in China, and we\u2019re here together in \nthe humane West. We don\u2019t believe in cruelty. We feel fur can be ethical. We\u2019re in \nliberal London, the capital of Great Britain, known throughout the world for fair play, \nfair game, the love of dogs, cats, foxes, and little children, and the Parliamentary \nhome of the British Fur Farming Prohibition Bill of 2003. We\u2019re not, as liberals, averse \nto a bit of cleaned up \u2018snuff\u2019, but we\u2019re intellectually attracted only\u2026 That poor old \nracoon in pesky China should be the last of a dying breed\u2026 Let\u2019s disavow together, \nhoney, and stroke the fur together, honey\u2026  \n \nDisavowal? Fetishist, we don\u2019t know whether our fur is ripped off a racoon\u2019s shrieking \nframe in Hebei Province, excised from the cooling body of Finnish fox whose pacing up \nand down in a fur farm cage beat out a rapid rhythm of despair, or sliced off some \ngibbering abject creature whose last meal was part of its own leg as it tries to gnaw \nits flesh and bone from the steel jaws of a leg-trap in deepest Omaha. Fetishist, we \nreally won\u2019t be able to tell if we\u2019ve been naughty little fur consumers or if we\u2019ve joined \nthe self-less fight against over-population by \u2018pest species\u2019...  \nAnd \u2013 honey \u2013 as for those darned proliferating baby harp seals on the ice floes of \nNewfoundland \u2026 damn their selfish fish-eating ways, honey...  \n \nImagine being a fish-eating fashion victim.  \nImagine wearing pure white baby fur.  \nImagine being a Newfoundland boy-man, steeling yourself for that first penetration. \nImagine being a fur virgin.  \nImagine that loss of innocence\u2026  \n \nImagine having a fur coat and no knickers.  \nImagine being a turn-coat.  \n \nImagine being Naomi and Cindy, infamously posing in PETA\u2019s \u2018I\u2019d rather go naked \nthan wear fur\u2019 campaign, then popping on the second-hand coats of dead animals \n(Frankel 1997; McVeigh 1999, referring to Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford). \nOnce a fetishist\u2026  \nImagine being Claudia and Melissa similarly \u2018changing their spots\u2019 (Fur Information \nCouncil of America, referring to Claudia Schiffer and Melissa Etheridge).  \nOnce a sadist\u2026  \n \nFur\u2019s ubiquity and versatility as seared, plucked, knitted and trimmed fabric as much \nas in swathes of the pure stuff, satisfies the \u2018snuff\u2019 enthusiasts as much as the lower-\nkey Mockles. Kardasis opines that farmed fur \u201cdoesn\u2019t make this right, it just makes it \nthe best we can do\u201d. Fur is, he asserts, \u201cthe first coverlet of your life\u201d (Kardasis 2005: \nunpaginated), but his guilt-tripping validation of a primal infant attachment to the \n\u2018mother-fur\u2019 is excruciating (he truly is the knowing-disavowing fetishist), and so far \naway from sexy sassy Kate Moss\u2019 promenade of her fatal-foetal attraction in velvety \ndove grey broadtail, baby-wrinkled and severed straight from Mummy. That, is the \nsexy fetishist, never mind whether it\u2019s the \u2018best we can do\u2019\u2026 \n \nImagine fur-lined fetish-knickers, Ms Moss \nImagine giving a damn...  \n \nFur farm footage shows cage-mad, stress-crazy foxes pacing, ducking, twitching, \nwhile excrement and filth builds up in layers below them; racoons incarcerated \nwithout cover or heating, but with the infected and cannibalised carcasses of their \ncage mates for company; a vixen with bone exposed in her ulcerated leg, her deeply \ninfected eyes waiting for death and accessories-use rather than full-pelt glory \n(www.petatv.com). It\u2019s uber-porn, all the more delightful since its narrative evidences \nthat market-acceptable lush and luscious fur will grow even in the short life of a \ntraumatised, undernourished, dehydrated, infected creature, putting paid to the \nargument that if caged fur animals weren\u2019t treated well, the fur would be poor.  \nLet\u2019s disavow\u2026 sit back and enjoy the movie.  \nImagine it\u2019s important that they aren\u2019t treated well (damn their verminous fish-eating \nways\u2026); imagine it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t think about it.  \nThis, essentially, is the expedient perversion of fur-loving: the oscillation of \ncontemporary Western fur-lovers between indulgence in not-knowing and enjoyment \nof the sheer pleasure of the fur (purist-fetishists), the impossibility of not-knowing but \nsomehow managing to turn away (disavowing fetishists), the rationalising of fur as \nnecessary in the grand scheme (masochistic moral apologists), and immersion in the \ndeathly delight and cruel excess of the \u2018snuff\u2019 (fur-sadists). This is the complexity and \ncharge of fur, more potent than any other fabric. \n \nA dog fox involuntarily bites on a metal pole as an electrically charged steel rod is \npushed upward deep into his rectum. The fox violently arches his back in orgasmic \necstasy, his insides fry, his teeth shatter, his heart slowly ruptures, he painstakingly \nshudders towards oblivion. It could be the best of \u2018snuff\u2019, an eloquent tale of climactic \ndeath inscribed with painful beauty, a noble guarantee that his fur, unmarked by \ncause of death (phew\u2026), will provide a full pelt and a sublime bodily experience for its \nwearer. This is what Stella McCartney describes as \u201cimmeasurable suffering\u201d, but \u2013 \nsomehow, sweetheart, it\u2019s because I\u2019m worth it.  \n \nImagine suffering immeasurably\u2026  \nImagine suffering deliciously\u2026  \nImagine lying naked in a cold space, while a thick and heavy blanket of finest dog-\nfoxy fur is slowly drawn up over each inch of your charged, enlivened body, your \nnipples like bullets, your clitoris rock hard (you bad phallic female fetishist, you), your \nheart racing, your pulse beating, your breath heavy and low...  \n \nRemember, dog fox, your fur equals sex, and more than one kind of sex. If it\u2019s not the \ncontrolled pleasure of a spike-heeled, sheath-skinned, skin-sheathed dominatrix, it\u2019s \nJ-Lo\u2019s blinged-up, sexy, sharp, street \u2018ho\u2019, or Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hypnotising ass-shakin\u2019 \nghetto-queen. It\u2019s Liz Hurley\u2019s sophisticated quintessentially English classic-fur charm, \nor Lizzie Jagger\u2019s hot-red foxy femme fatale. It\u2019s kitten-heeled, kitten-soft, Monroe-\nkittenish kitten-kitsch or it\u2019s four minks on a puritan\u2019s shoulder\u2026 Yes, Quan, you\u2019re \nright when you note that a \u201cwoman in a fabulous fur coat looks arrogant and carnal \nbecause she obviously does not mind if a few animals have died to keep her warm\u201d \n(Quan 1998:2), and yes, Lurie, you\u2019re close to the essence when you state that \u201cOne \nof the most persistent specialized forms of erotic appeal is that which connects love \nand death, sometimes so closely that only what is damaged or dangerous can arouse \nthe passions\u201d (Lurie 1992:256). But note please Williams\u2019 arguing of complicity \nbetween those who witness cinematographic \u2018snuff\u2019, \u201cin the flesh\u201d even if on screen, \nand the abusive perversion of its mode of production (1990:185). Her contention that \n\u201cgoing to a cinema to watch a death spasm is obscene\u201d is surely no less dreadful than \nwearing its results (1990:186), and it provides a useful focus for reflection on the \n(porno)graphically described death of our dear dog fox above. So, with fashion \nproviding opportunity for enactment of specific fetishistic or ambiguous sadistic sexual \nfantasy, fur finds a top billing in the material construction of sexuality, its fabric sado-\nfetish operating to both focus desire on and disclose \u201cthe real object of curiosity and \ndesire\u201d, arguably the human body and ultimately its genital prize beneath the animal\u2019s \nfur (Hamlyn 2003:13)\u2026 \n \nNadeau asserts that \u201cSkin, flesh, fur all act as interfaces of the female body [my \nemphasis]\u201d (2001:8), and the association of fur and female genitalia as representing a \nhighly sexualised focus for the typically male fetishist is well documented (Freud \n2005:299). Such association is apparent in visual practice: Oppenheim\u2019s dainty \nBreakfast in Fur (1933) invites erotic domestic oral consumption; Helen Chadwick\u2019s I \nThee Wed (1993) encircles phallic vegetable forms in furry rings; Linda Dement\u2019s In \nmy Gash (1995) explores the artist\u2019s corporeal aggression, fleshly desire and \ndestructive fantasies in vulval digital fur imagery. Jana Sterbak\u2019s pungent Vanitas: \nFlesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic (1987) may be closer to the real picture. Quan \n(1998:2) proposes that a \u201cmink or sable worn half-open is reminiscent of \u2018a woman\u2019s \nlush, unwaxed outer labia\u201d, and Helmut Newton\u2019s Laura Dressed in a Fox Cape, \nAvenue George V, Paris (1974) pictorially activates just this concept. In the film \nPerformance (1970, UK, directed by Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg) the \npolysexual protagonist Pherber lies talking to her London Gangster while stroking her \nfur coat just above her naked crotch, and other commentators note the various fur \nreferences connected to colloquial or vulgar terms for the vulva or vagina \u2013 pussy \n(Bell-Price and da Cruz 2005:117), muff (Lurie 1992:234; Bolton 2005:72), beaver \n(Nadeau 2001:12), meat (Adams 1990), and just as fur \n \n\u2026the emotion I felt being inside her fur, literally inside, \nbecause you see when she grabbed me to kiss me, her coat \nhalf-opened and suddenly I found myself inside her fur, so \nto speak \u2026 I suddenly remembered Tata Rachel\u2019s black \npubic hair of my childhood dreams, and I started feeling \nsomething bulge inside my pants\u2026  \n(Federman 2001:215) \n \n \n \nAngela Carter takes us further and darker, linking \u2013 in \u2018cunning lingua\u2019 \u2013 the intensely \noral aspect of female genitalia to the skinning of fur production and a form of erotic \nskinned rebirth as \u201ceach stoke of his tongue ripped off skin after successive skin \u2026 \nand left behind a nascent patina of shining hairs\u201d (Carter 1979:75). So, as Quan \nnotes, \u201cFur had a bad reputation before PETA tried to give it one\u201d (1998:1), and in \nmore general terms associations with selling, or at least trading, sex and the \nachievement of fur ownership are strong. Filmic representations of the prostitute (or \nequivalent) and her fur are many: in Pabst\u2019s The Joyless Street (1925), Garbo\u2019s fur \ncoat \u201cfunctions as a soft currency of libidinal exchange\u201d (Emberley: 1998:4), while in \nMann\u2019s Butterfield 8 (1960), Taylor\u2019s fur coat informs the viewer of her character\u2019s \nsexual and moral degeneracy. The excessive consumption of fur by the current \n\u2018celebrity nobility\u2019 is notable, and echoes the sex-charge and power-potency of these \nrelations. Liebovitz\u2019s American Vogue image of P. Diddy Combs\u2019 emergence from a \nwhite Mercedes, in a white fox fur coat, with a white \u2018trophy\u2019 woman (played child-like \nby Kate Moss) into a crowd of paparazzi showcases Combs as one of the fur-clad \naristocrats of the new Golden Age of Glamour (Bolton 2005:53). With his fox an \nencultured white, worn easily on confident shoulders of assured status, her fur is \n\u2018other\u2019, a wilder \u2018cat-spot\u2019, clutched by this ambiguous woman-girl-creature for \nprotection from other predators. The sub-text relationship \u2013 wealthy male and fur-clad \nmistress; whore and pimp; cultured and animalistic; sadist and fetishist; black man \nand white woman \u2013 is linked to the archetypal iconography of fur particularly since the \nearlier twentieth century. Bolton (2005:53) mines fur\u2019s other association of \u201cvirility, \nmachismo, and, ultimately, male dominance\u201d via its \u201cespousal and acquisition by \npimps\u201d, referencing Tracy Funches\u2019 Virgo Couple photograph (1998 from the \nPIMPNOSIS series, 1995-2001) in which a naked black woman clings to her pimp who \nis head to heel in white fur, diamonds and chain, bespoke suit and fur trilby. Bolton \ndescribes the fur\u2019s role in mediating the relationship between possessor and \npossessed asserting that the \u201cmink coat\u2026along with a Cadillac or Rolls Royce, is a \npimp\u2019s most palpable display of economic and sexual supremacy\u201d (2005:53). Hot and \nheady \u2018snuff\u2019\u2026 \n \nThe pimp-whore power dynamic manifests also in the role of the fur in the clothed and \nunclothed gendered body scenario. Skov (2005:21) picks up on fur\u2019s contested role in \nnavigating between historicised notions of individual personality expression through \nclothing and societal fears of \u201cshowing too much\u201d, thereby \u201cgiving off signs of a \nsexuality at odds with the dominant perception of feminine morality\u201d. Skov argues \nthat tension was resolved by the layering possible in adoption of the fur coat, which \nallowed a \u201cnew sexual layer to the dressed appearance\u201d which has then focused fur \nexplicitly on the body underneath, whether dressed or not (Skov 2005, citing Sennett, \n1992: 188-9). This layering is essentially played out as a key theme in the iconic \nnarrative of von Sacher-Masoch\u2019s Venus in Furs (originally published in 1870). \nProtagonist Wanda, in \u201cErmine furs [that] adorn the imperious\u201d (Velvet Underground \nVenus in Furs 1966) cruelly and sadistically dominates the story\u2019s male character. Key \nto reading her fur, we are compelled to understand that she is physically and \nemotionally icy, and it is the interface between her marble skin and the warm furs \nthat mobilise the sexual exchange between Wanda and Leopold. Nadeau argues that it \nis exactly the \u201ccarnal and intimate contact\u201d between female and animal skin that \ncreates an enormous sexually-charged and sensually mesmeric force in Wanda, \nrendering her combination of self and fur as embodying desire for her slave, and \nenabling the exchange of heightened pleasure for devoted adoration (Nadeau \n2001:15). Leopold\u2019s character Severin effortlessly connects sexual passion with \ntyranny and cruelty perpetrated by a fur-clad woman, describing the exquisite \npleasure of sexualised suffering and torture. So, the potency of the fur-clad female is \nrendered archetypal. The cruel coldness of Wanda informs a range of scenarios from \nthat of the trophy huntress (Lurie 1992:233) to the animalistic primitive, from that of \npretenders to being \u201ca very expensive animal\u201d (Lurie 1992:232) to the versatile and \nbrittle heroine-villainesses of 1940s film noir who \u201cdripped furs over their severe \ntailor-mades \u2026 backless, slinky dresses \u2026 trenchcoats\u2026\u201d (Wilson 2003:143-144), from \nNew Yorker fur panache and \u201cunrepentant, brash display\u201d to Knightsbridge furs\u2019 \n\u201cbadge of class\u201d (Wilson 2003: 140), and from the \u2018foxy lady\u2019 of David Garnett\u2019s Lady \ninto Fox novel (1922) to Bell-Price\u2019s \u201csartorial barbarism\u201d (2005:20,31). \n \nImagine being barbaric\u2026  \n \nEd Gein (1906-1984) peeled his murder victims and exhumed corpses for the same \npurpose, fashioning a \u2018woman suit\u2019 in the USA of the late 1950s. His peelings informed \nthe fictional \u2018Buffalo Bill\u2019 Jame Gumb who starved and removed the skin of his victims \nto similarly construct a garment in Jonathan Demme\u2019s film Silence of the Lambs \n(1991). How problematic would it be to raise an argument that the knowing use and \nwearing of fur must echo (at least) the viewing of (if not participation in) the most \nheightened versions of sadomasochistic pornography since the sensibility required to \npass the use of fur must either be that of the sadist (dominating the animal) or \nperhaps the masochist (in abject empathy with the animal), or wavering, as good \nperverts do, between them both? As in critiques of the spectatorship of such \npornography, might an argument hold that the user is only one step removed from \nthe bloody action of the means of production, which is implicit in the product? That is, \nis the wearer of fur only one remove from the barbarism, excess and orgiastic cruelty \nof its manufacture, and indeed is this absolutely understood by the consumer of fur \n(even if subsequently denied to allow return to the purist pleasure of the absolutist \nfetishist)? \n \nWriting of hard-core SM and \u2018snuff\u2019 porn, Williams examines the \u2018slasher\u2019 film genre \nwhich \u201clike pornography \u2026 pries open the fleshy secrets of normally hidden things\u201d \n(1990:191), and the \u2018snuff\u2019 film category comprising \u201ca perverse displacement of \npornographic hard-core sexual activities, which typically end in penetration, onto the \npenetrating violation of the body\u2019s very flesh\u201d (1990:192). In describing  \u201cthe \nperverse pleasure of witnessing the involuntary spasm of death\u201d (1990:193), Williams \nmight as readily be transposed onto a discourse of witnessing or wearing the fur \nevidence of the agonies of fur-bearing animals prior to and during their surrender of \ntheir fur. Might this be considered analogous to the witnessing of the execution or \ndischarge of \u2018snuff\u2019? Arguably, if a fur coat has some connection to pubic hair, then \nthe body of a dying animal or a dying woman exposes the hidden orgasm that hard-\ncore can never see but always seeks. Williams cites the \u201cfrenzy of the visible\u201d in \n\u2018snuff\u2019, which counteracts the \u201cinvisible involuntary spasm of orgasm that is so hard to \nsee in the body of the woman\u201d (1990:194), that \u201cintangible aspect\u201d that for Bataille \n(1986:29) is the essence of human eroticism. Williams further queries the hidden \nnature of the female orgasm and the need for its disclosure: \n \nRead in the context of pornography \u2026 a flinch, a convulsion, \na welt, even the flow of blood itself, would seem to offer \nincontrovertible proof that a woman\u2019s body, so resistant to \nthe involuntary show of pleasure, has been touched, \u2018moved\u2019 \nby some force  \n(Williams 1990:194). \n \n \nDoes a fur then allow us collective access to a moving experience, a body death, an \norgasmic climax, that is normally denied us? Might we further consider the ice maiden \nswathed in pelts as so essentially disembodied that her orgasm is only visible in the \nanimal\u2019s death? I think here of da Cruz\u2019s relation of how the quivering bristle of fur\u2019s \ntexture signifies its connection to \u201canimals aroused by passion or aggression\u2026 [and] \n\u2026sexual gentility and ferocity\u201d (2005:166). That arousal conjures the (detachable) \nphallus, and Williams reminds us that Andrea Dworkin (1987:63) defined \u201call sexual \nacts involving heterosexual penetration as real or symbolic aggression and thus as \nsadism\u201d (Williams 1990:195). The sexualised \u2018penetration\u2019 of the fur-bearing animal \nvia the teeth of traps, through shock-inducing anal\/vaginal insertion, in asphyxiation\u2019s \ngag or poison\u2019s invasion, by bullet piercing, pressing, strangling, stamping, \nbludgeoning, or through the \u2018skin flick\u2019 of being peeled alive, enacts Kaja Silverman\u2019s \n(1988:31 in Williams 1990:195) interrogation of Freud\u2019s articulation of perverse \nsexuality, defined as not ending in coitus, and lacking \u201ca genital goal or discharge or \n\u2018end-pleasure\u2019\u201d. Further, Williams\u2019 description of a typical SM film: \u201cThere is no visible \nclimax, in either the dramatic or the sexual sense of the word, only a suspenseful \nspectacle of prolonged suffering\u201d (1990:197) is telling if applied to the temporal and \nspatial distantiation enacted by even those fur-wearing consumers who acknowledge \nthe sexualised violence inherent in fur. That separation, fur\u2019s \u201cnihilistic desire for \nsensation\u201d (Arnold 2001:57), is that which Williams describes thus: \n \n\u2026we are watching (whether with fascination, pleasure, \nhorror, or dread) an act that seems real but with which we \nhave no physical connection ourselves (Williams 1990:188). \n \n \nSo, if normatively \u201cAbject terror [is] gendered feminine\u201d (Clover 1987:212, referenced \nin Williams 1990:207), is fur-wearing a means by which a woman achieves the high \ndrag of phallic supremacy, interfering with \u2013 though not overtly challenging \u2013 \nnormative hierarchies of male and female sexual and power relations?  \n \nImagine wearing a fur phallus\u2026 \n \nIn the ineffectual high camp of fashion speak, Valerie Steele asserts \u201cdesigners today \nare increasingly channelling the spirit of warrior women, with female modernity \nconcerned with a fashion discourse of silk and steel\u201d (Steele 2006:1). In this \nlanguage, fur operates specifically to conjure the intimacy, nakedness and sensuality \nof lingerie while simultaneously activating hard protection and powerful discipline. By \ndoing so, fashion\u2019s female protagonist is situated as a delicate man-eater or femme \nfatale, a \u201cconceptual fusion of woman and beast\u201d however other she appears (da Cruz \n2005:145).  As Medusa, Siren, spider-woman, \u2018black widow\u2019, eroticised death, as the \nanimalistic and ferocious Irena of Cat People (1982), the feral savage, or Bell-Price\u2019s \n\u201cancient Amazon, the voluptuous virago and divine huntress\u201d (2005:13), or even as \nthe still-potent persona of Mrs Danvers, the depraved and secretive lesbian stroking \nthe dead Mrs de Winter\u2019s fur coat over her cheek (Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca 1940), she is \nthe perpetrator of a sexualised act of terror and destruction. This is acknowledged \nrepeatedly: \n \nThe fur-bearing woman, as a class unto herself, collectively \ncomes to figure as a cold and cruel monstrosity, an \naccessory to the crime who would wear her capacity for \nterror and violence on her sleeve (Emberley 1998:25) \n \n \nBut darker again, Bell-Price and da Cruz reference pagan animism, witchery, \u201cpsychic \nfelinism\u201d, and folkloric antiquity (2005:117) in relation for fur-wearing females, citing \nthe Bacchantes\u2019 \u201cinfamous unbridled frenzy \u2026 murderous savagery \u2026 frolicking with \nanimals or wearing their skins \u2026\u201d (2005:130). Such excess becomes fur, with its \nthreat of extinction, its insatiable appetite, and its interconnectedness to death.  \n \nThe ravenous femme fatale is never more present, however, than with the unborn \nkarakul lambs of Central Asia whose unformed fur makes astrakhan (also known as \nbroadtail or Persian wool). As modelled by Madonna, this finest of fur requires firm \npressure on the ewe\u2019s stomach or a quick slash to her throat, aborting her young up \nto thirty days before they are due without any death marking of the foetal-soft, curly-\ncute and terror-tender skin (Haven 2002). The \u201ccruellest and most vicious fur\u201d (Croft \n2005) is available from Lagerfeld, Fendi, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana and others. Nadeau \nasserts \u201dfur per se has no value without the raw materiality of skin, and the constant \nrearticulation and sexualized negotiation between skin and pelts, between the \napparent mobility of the body and the aberrant stillness of fur\u2026\u201d (2001:17). The \nmoment of death may be configured as rapturous, honourable, ecstatic, orgasmic, \ntranscendental, but ultimately it is truly and actually deathly, as is the best \u2018snuff\u2019. \nHere, where \u201ckilling functions as a form of rape\u201d, the ultimate orgasm is the \n\u201cpenetrating violation of the body\u2019s very flesh\u201d (Williams 1990:191-192) in a \u2018money \nshot\u2019 combination of the foetal unborn and the already \u2018snuffed\u2019\u2026 \n \nDeath-marks on the fur represent the key to this essay. For some of the consumers \u2013 \nlovers, for that is the potency of the engagement \u2013 of fur I argue that the (symbolic) \nvisibility of those death marks is vital to their appreciation of their fur. These are the \nfur sadists, for whom terror, death, pain and abject suffering inform the fur they wear, \ninflect their enjoyment of it, and allows their dominion over the animals and their \npotency, phallic of otherwise, to be part of the enactment of their pleasure. I have \ntraced and exemplified those who are steeped in this aspect of fur\u2019s particularity and \npleasure. And I have asserted that this form of fur-loving is close in essence to the \nextreme enjoyment of the real death action of ultimate \u2018snuff\u2019.  \n \nThis is not the whole story, however, and there is no question that fur\u2019s position as \nthe ultimate fabric is desire is assured by a more complex and dynamic set of \nmeaning and articulations. For others who love fur the need to disavow its origins \u2013 in \nspite of not being able to avoid that knowledge \u2013 is essential to their fetish-purist \nappreciation of the idealised pleasure affect of fur fabric. It is their complete refusal of \nfur as a skinned beast that permits their fetishised relationship to it. \n \nBut this too is not the whole story.  \n \nI believe that fur is an extraordinary phenomenon in fashion in this time in human \ncultural history. It defines the wild complexity of human sexual perversion by \ncombining apparently opposite psychic forces \u2013 the will to destroy and the desire to \nappreciate. Enabling the perverse interconnection of sadistic and fetishistic drives, it \nreflects our collective capability for sexual decadence and the satiation of appetites \nregardless of cost. The death marks are always there, and cannot truly be ignored or \noverseen. This essay merely maps the field of fur-love, proposing that it is impossible \nnot to see the death-marks, and suggesting that the differences between the perverse \npositions of fur-lovers lie only in whether they choose to directly view or perform the \nheat of the \u2018snuff\u2019 or to delicately slide their eyes away to linger on the cooled pelt.  \n \n \n \nBibliography \n \nAdams, C.
