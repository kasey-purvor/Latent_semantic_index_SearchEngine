Introduction \n \nThe focus of the search for traces of past and present extraterrestrial life is on Mars, \nwhere recent discoveries indicate that the environmental conditions necessary to \nsupport life may have been commonplace at times in its history. Examples include \nfeatures in sediments indicative of standing water detected by the NASA Mars \nExploration Rovers (Squyres et al., 2004), the detection of the potential biosignature \nmethane in the atmosphere of Mars by the ESA Mars Express orbiter (Formisano et \nal., 2004) and the confirmation of extant water ice in the subsurface near Mars\u2019 north \npole by the NASA Phoenix lander (Smith et al., 2009). Forthcoming missions, such as \nESA\u2019s ExoMars, seek to transform these hints of life into the discovery of past or \npresent biology. All known life is based on organic compounds; hence carbon-based \nmolecules are the targets for life-detection missions. To date, the only experiments \ndesigned to detect life on Mars were the biology experiments of the Viking Landers. \nThe Viking gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) detected no organic \ncompounds in the martian soil, and the positive result of the Labelled Release \nexperiment has generally been interpreted in terms of soil chemistry, rather than \nbiology (Biemann, 1976; Sims et al., 2005). More recently, an alternative mechanism \nof detection, the Specific Molecular Identification of Life Experiment (SMILE) (Sims \net al., 2005), has been proposed, in which solvents would be used to extract organic \nmatter from the soil and introduce it into sensitive, antibody-based detection \ninstrument (e.g., Sims et al., 2005). \n \nHowever, this approach meets difficulties regarding the choice of solvent. A single \nsolvent capable of extracting a wide range of compounds is desirable but challenging, \n 4\nas target compounds include polar biomolecules such as amino acids and non-polar \nfossil hydrocarbons such as isoprenoids. Two approaches have emerged that can \naccommodate a wide range of compounds using a single solvent. One approach is to \nmanipulate the polarity of water by varying its temperature and pressure (Aubrey et \nal., 2008). This method can target compounds of specific polarity by precisely \nmatching the polarity of water to a particular class of analyte. An alternative approach \nis to add surfactants to aqueous solutions, forming micelles that encapsulate non-polar \norganic compounds within a polar solution. A surfactant approach to organic \nextraction on space missions has additional benefits for solutions designed for \nmicrofluidic detection equipment, as surfactants are wetting agents that prepare \nmicrofluidic component surfaces for fluid transport, Furthermore, protein-based \nantibodies, which represent an attractive detection mechanism, are relatively \nunaffected by surfactant solutions, in contrast to the deleterious effects of organic \nsolvents (Cullen et al., personal communication). \n \nIn this paper, we report on the development of surfactant solutions as solvents for in \nsitu life detection experiments. We have spiked a terrestrial analogue of Martian soil, \nJSC Mars-1 (Allen et al., 1998), with a range of organic molecules, and then used a \nrange of solvents to gauge their extraction efficiency. The results indicate that \nsurfactant solutions have wide applicability on space missions, especially where \nmicrofluidic systems are the final destination of any extracted organic matter. \n \n 5\n2. Methodology \n \nBriefly, samples of JSC Mars-1 were spiked with known masses of standards and \nextracted using a range of solvents. The efficiency of the solvents at extracting the \nstandards was then determined by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). \n \n2.1. Samples, standards and solvents \n \nThe Martian soil analogue, JSC Mars-1, was chosen as the material on which the \nstandards were applied. JSC Mars-1 is the <1 mm size fraction of a palagonitic tephra \nfrom the Pu\u2019u Nene cinder cone, located in the saddle between Mauna Loa and Mauna \nKea volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii (Allen et al., 1998). The JSC Mars-1 was \ncleaned prior to spiking with standards using ultrasonic extraction, first with a 93:7 \nvol:vol mixture of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol, then with deionised water, \nto remove any soluble organic components.  \n \nSamples of JSC Mars-1 were spiked with seven standards \u2013 atrazine, anthracene, \nhexadecane, phytane, pyrene, squalene and stigmasterol (Fig 1). Standards were \nchosen to reflect a range of structures and solubilities in water. Four solvents were \nused to extract spiked samples of JSC Mars-1 \u2013 93:7 DCM:methanol; 67:33 \nhexane:acetone, 20:80 methanol:water and 20:80 methanol:water with 1.5 mg ml-1 of \nthe non-ionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene (80) sorbitan monooleate, commonly \nknown as polysorbate 80 (P80). All ratios are by volume. \n \n 6\n2.2. Extraction procedure \n \nPreliminary experiments indicated that P80 concentrations in the range of 1.5-2.5 mg \nml-1 in 20:80 methanol:water were able to extract organic compounds. Stronger \nconcentrations of P80 did not result in significantly more efficient extraction, so a P80 \nconcentration of 1.5 mg ml-1 was chosen. Aliquots of 1000 mg of JSC Mars-1, \npreviously cleaned by extraction with 93:7 DCM:methanol and deionised water, were \nplaced in test tubes previously cleaned by baking in air at 500 \u00b0C for several hours. To \neach was added 1 ml of a solution of the seven standards in DCM, each standard \nbeing present at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g ml-1. The solvent-wet JSC Mars-1 was then \nallowed to dry overnight in a hotbox set at 35 \u00b0C. \n \nTo each spiked aliquot of JSC Mars-1, 3 ml of the appropriate solvent was added \n(Table 1). Extraction using 93:7 DCM:methanol and 67:33 hexane:acetone was \nperformed using one test tube each. Extraction using 20:80 methanol:water and P80 \nsolution was performed in triplicate. Each test tube was sonicated for 20 minutes, \nusing a Sonics & Materials, Inc. VCX-130 Vibra-Cell sonicator set at 40% amplitude, \ndelivering about 2-3 W to the sonic probe head. Following sonication, the test tube \nwas centrifuged at 1500 rpm for two minutes and the supernatant was pipetted away \nto a separate test tube. Two further cycles of addition of solvent, sonication, \ncentrifugation and pipetting of the supernatant then followed. \n \nThe accumulated supernatant was filtered using a 200 nm filter \u2013 a cellulose acetate \nfilter for the aqueous solutions and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter for the \norganic solvents. The organic solvents were blown down under a stream of nitrogen \n 7\nthen redissolved in DCM, ready for injection onto a GC-MS. Evaporation of the less \nvolatile aqueous extracts was impractical and could have caused the loss of analytes, \nso liquid-liquid extraction was performed to transport the dissolved standards from the \naqueous phase to the DCM.  \n \nFor liquid-liquid extraction, one-quarter of the volume of each aqueous extract was \nplaced with 6 ml of DCM in test tubes and sonicated using the VCX-130 sonicator, \nusing the same settings as described previously, for 20 minutes, to ensure good \nmixing between the aqueous and organic phases.  The sonication of the aqueous and \norganic phases produced a white emulsion that was separated using 2 minutes of 1500 \nrpm centrifugation and standing overnight. Following separation, both phases were \ntransferred to a separating funnel, with the test tube being rinsed three times each with \nDCM and the appropriate aqueous solvent, with these solvents also being added to the \nseparating funnel, to avoid loss of analyte. Using the separating funnel the denser \norganic phase was separated from the aqueous solution. Two further ~3 ml volumes \nof DCM were then individually added to the separating funnel, with the denser \norganic phase being transferred to the test tube each time. Finally, the DCM solution \nwas blown down under a stream of nitrogen to a volume of 1 ml, which was then \ntransferred to a vial ready for GC-MS analysis, again with repeated rinsing of the test \ntube interior with DCM to minimise analyte loss.  \n \n2.3. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry \n \nThe extracts of the spiked JSC Mars-1 were analysed using an Agilent 6890N gas \nchromatograph (GC) and a 5973 Mass Selective Detector. One \u00b5l of solvent was \n 8\ninjected in to the DB-5MS column, with helium carrier gas flowing at 1.1 ml min-1. \nThe GC oven was initially held at 50 \u00b0C for 1 minute, then the temperature raised at 4 \n\u00b0C min-1 to 310 \u00b0C, where it was held for 20 minutes, for a total run length of 86 \nminutes. The standards were identified by reference to the NIST 98 mass spectral \ndatabase, and the retention times for this instrumental configuration established by \nprevious runs of the individual standards. \n \n 9\n3. Results \n \n3.1. Chromatograms of extracted JSC Mars-1 \n \nChromatograms displaying the compounds extracted from the spiked samples are \nshown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A and 2B show 93:7 DCM:methanol and 67:33 hexane:acetone \nextracts, showing efficient extraction of the standards added to the JSC Mars-1. Fig. \n2C shows the liquid-liquid extract of the 20:80 methanol:water extract of the spiked \nJSC Mars-1, revealing that only the water-soluble atrazine was extracted \u2013 no trace of \nthe other standards was detectable. However, the addition of 1.5 mg ml-1 P80 to the \n20:80 methanol:water enabled significant amounts of hexadecane, phytane and \nsqualene, and some stigmasterol, to be extracted, as shown in Fig. 2D. As noted \nabove, the aqueous extracts were each performed in triplicate and only representative \nchromatograms are shown in Fig. 2D. \n \n3.2. Quantification of extraction efficiencies \n \nThe extraction efficiencies of each standard in each chromatogram were quantified by \nmeasuring the area of each peak. Comparison of these areas to the areas of these \npeaks in the chromatogram of the 93:7 DCM:methanol extract enables the \ndetermination of relative extraction efficiencies (Table 1). The areas of peaks in the \nchromatograms of the aqueous extracts were multiplied by four, to account for the \ndivision of these aqueous extracts into four aliquots. The data is also shown \ngraphically in Fig. 3. \n \n 10\nExtraction with 67:33 hexane:acetone is about as efficient as extraction with 93:7 \nDCM:methanol, except for squalene and stigmasterol, where extraction with 67:33 \nhexane:acetone is considerably more efficient than with 93:7 DCM:methanol. For the \naqueous solvents, 20:80 methanol:water alone was capable of only extracting the \npartially water-soluble atrazine. However, the addition of 1.5 mg ml-1 P80 enabled the \nextraction of the aliphatic compounds hexadecane, phytane and squalene, although no \npyrene or anthracene was detectable. Relative to 93:7 DCM:methanol, the P80 \nsolution gave an extraction efficiency of up to 30% for hexadecane and phytane, and \nup to about 10% for squalene and stigmasterol.  \n \n 11\n4. Discussion \n \n4.1. Solvent extraction efficiencies  \n \nA solution of 1.5 mg ml-1 P80 in 20:80 methanol:water allows the extraction of \naliphatic standards, such as hexadecane and phytane, at an efficiency of about 30%, \nrelative to 93:7 DCM:methanol. The extraction of squalene and stigmasterol using \nP80 is rather less efficient, but still achieves extraction efficiencies of ~5% of that of \n93:7 DCM:methanol.  \n \nIn contrast to the good extraction efficiencies for aliphatic compounds, the aromatic \ncompounds pyrene and anthracene were not detected. This observation is unexpected \nas P80 has been proposed as a surfactant for solubilising polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons from contaminated soils (Yeom et al., 1995). The result must reflect the \nchemistry of the P80 surfactant and\/or the hydrophobicity of the low molecular \nweight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. P80 consists of hydrophilic \npolyoxymethylene head and a long hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon tail. Aromatic \ncompounds, which are likely to exist prior to extraction sorped to mineral surface or \nincorporated in micropores, may be less well accommodated in, or attracted to, the \nP80 micelles. Hence, the P80 solution is an aqueous solvent capable of selectively \nextracting aliphatic compounds under the conditions described. \n \n4.2. Solvent systems for Mars \n \n4.2.1. Extraction efficiency of P80 solution \n 12\n \nThe antibody assay system planned for the LMC will contain antibodies capable of \nbinding to representative compounds that may be found within the Martian regolith \n(Parnell et al., 2007). These antibodies will denature in the presence of organic \nsolvents such as DCM. However, surfactant-based aqueous solvents, such as the P80 \nsolution employed here, do not denature the antibodies and are therefore suitable for \nthe LMC. Nevertheless, it is essential that the solvent chosen is capable of efficiently \nextracting organic compounds from the Martian regolith. The data presented here \nshows a 25-30% extraction efficiency, relative to 93:7 DCM:methanol, for the P80 \nsurfactant solution. Although the chances of successful detection of organic \ncompounds in the Martian soil ultimately depend on the concentration of that organic \nmatter, we consider P80 to be an acceptable compromise between extraction \nefficiency and antibody compatibility.  \n \n4.2.2. Spiked JSC Mars-1 as a model of the martian regolith \n \nThe standards were applied to the JSC Mars-1 by evaporating their host solvent and \nthereby depositing the compounds on the surfaces of mineral grains presenting easily \naccessible targets for extraction. However, natural organic matter in rocks can be \nbound to minerals and spread heterogeneously throughout a rock. Organic matter \nintermingled in this fashion is undoubtedly more difficult to extract than organic \nmatter simply deposited on the surfaces of grains. However, it is worth noting that the \nsonication regime employed here had the effect of eroding the grains of JSC Mars-1, \nproducing fine-grained material suspended in the solvent, demonstrating that \nsonication-assisted extraction, as intended to be used by the LMC, is likely to be \n 13\ncapable of extracting organic matter in the interiors of grains. Further work is \nnecessary to understand the extraction of more mineralogically and organically-\ndiverse samples. \n \n4.2.3. Organic compounds expected in the martian regolith \n \nThe nature of the organic compounds expected in the Martian subsurface, and the \nalteration chemistry occurring, of relevance to the LMC was summarised by Parnell et \nal. (2007) and will only be discussed briefly here. Two sources of organic matter in \nthe Martian regolith can be inferred \u2013 a definite source in meteoritic infall and a \npossible source in biology. These organic compounds are then processed by oxidants \nin the soil and by ionising radiation, resulting in a wide range of possible compounds. \nMeteoritic infall is estimated to deliver about 240 tonnes of organic matter annually to \nMars (Flynn, 1996), much in the form of a refractory organic macromolecule, but \nbiologically relevant amino acids (e.g., Sephton, 2002) and nucleobases (Martins et \nal., 2008) can also occur. The nature of organic matter produced from indigenous \nMartian biology is open to speculation, but the design of the LMC has assumed that it \nwill share certain similarities with terrestrial life (Parnell et al., 2007). On Earth and \npresumably on Mars it is the lipid components that are most likely to persist in either \nrecent or ancient fossil form (Sephton, 2010) and this preservation potential has \nensured that the majority of terrestrial biomarker methods focus on aliphatic \nhydrocarbon compounds. In this context the development of an antibody compatible \nsolvent system that efficiently and selectively extracts an information rich fraction of \norganic compounds can be viewed as a positive development.  \n \n 14\n5. Conclusions \n \n1. Surfactant-based solutions are effective at extracting aliphatic standards spiked on \nto the Martian analogue, JSC Mars-1. Hexadecane and phytane spiked on to JSC \nMars-1 are extracted by a 1.5 mg ml-1 solution of polysorbate 80 in 20:80 \nmethanol:water at about 25-30% of the extraction efficiency of 93:7 DCM:methanol. \nSqualene and stigmasterol are extracted less efficiently, about 5-10% of the extraction \nefficiency of 93:7 DCM:methanol.  In contrast, extraction by 20:80 methanol:water \nalone, without the surfactant, did not extract any of these compounds. \n \n2. The polysorbate 80 solution did not extract the aromatic compounds spiked to JSC \nMars-1, pyrene and anthracene. Hence, the polysorbate 80 solvent solution appears to \nselectively extract the most information rich compound class for fossil biomarker \nanalysis, the aliphatic hydrocarbons. \n \n3. The Life Marker Chip, being developed for the detection of the chemical signature \nof life in the Martian subsurface, requires a solvent to transfer biomarkers from the \nsoil to the antibody sites on the LMC itself. This solvent cannot be organic, as it \nwould denature the antibodies, and the aqueous solvent 20:80 methanol:water does \nnot extract the water-insoluble organic solvents. However, addition of 1.5 mg ml-1 \npolysorbate 80 to the 20:80 methanol:water provides an effective compromise \nbetween extraction efficiency and antibody compatibility. \n \nAcknowledgements.
