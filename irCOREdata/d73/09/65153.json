We end with consideration of issues to do with facilitating the early \nrecognition that a strategizing intervention can stall. \n \n 2 \n1.0 Introduction \nWriters on strategic management have argued that for continued survival an \norganization\u201fs strategic decision making must achieve the retention of the \norganization\u201fs alignment with the external environment [1-3]. Failure to achieve this \nresults in strategic drift Johnson [4]. Huff et al. [5] contend that inertia in such \n(re)alignment, defined as the degree of the level of commitment to the organisation\u201fs \ncurrent strategy, will grow over time as current ways of operating become deeply \nembedded in an organization, regardless of, and generally without reference to, \ndevelopments in the environment. Commitment to the status quo will, they argue, \nescalate in a smooth, undisturbed fashion over time with incremental adjustments to \nthe current strategy and little conscious attention to strategic choice, so long as \norganizational performance is satisfactory. However, if and when it becomes evident \nwithin the organisation that there is no longer an appropriate alignment between its \nstrategy and the requirements of the environment, \u201cpressure for change\u201d will \ninevitably develop.  \n \nNote that the causal mechanisms behind strategic inertia have not been well \ndescribed or documented in the strategic management literature. Barr and Huff [6] \nargued that \u201c\u2026 strategic change becomes more and more probable as the \u2026 \npressure for change \u2026 resulting from various stimuli exceeds the current level of \ninertia (pressure to maintain the status quo\u201d (p 342)   However,  as Huff and Huff  [7] \nhave argued, \u201c\u2026 there is little guidance from the literature \u2026 to suggest when \nresponse \u2026 will focus an incremental homeostatic adjustments (to strategy) and \nwhen more dramatic \u2026 change in direction traditionally of interest to strategy \nresearchers is likely to occur\u201d (p 84).   \n \nIn this paper, we document and analyse the strategic views of individual members of \na top management team at the time of a scenario planning intervention by the \n 3 \nauthors. The agreed aim of the scenario intervention was to evaluate the degree of \nexpansion of production that was necessary in light of plausible changes in the future \ndemand for a key product. However, after the standard pre-intervention interviews \nhad been conducted with the top team, and the results circulated within the team, the \nscenario process stalled and key members of the team dis-engaged. Why was this? \nWe analyse the content of the pre-intervention interviews using two frameworks: (i) \nthat of Janis and Mann [8] who proposed that decisions with conflicted options \nprovoke stress responses within individual decision makers that are reduced by the \nunconscious operation of defensive mechanisms - which act  to maintain the decision \nmaker\u201fs mental equilibrium and (ii) that of Maitis and Lawrence [9] who proposed a \ngeneral, situational, framework for understanding failures in organizational \nstrategizing. Details of both of these frameworks are given later. \n \nThe Janis and Mann framework was previously used by Hodgkinson and Wright [10] \nin an earlier analysis of a failed scenario intervention. The difference between \nHodgkinson and Wright\u201fs analysis and the present one is that in the current case \nanalysis, we find that all members of the top management team, apart from the CEO, \nrecognised that the expansion decision was fraught with risk. Additionally, all \nmembers of the team recognised that change from this strategy was also hazardous. \nIn the Hodgkinson and Wright study, the whole of the top team sought a resolution to \nthe common perception that both the currently-followed strategy and alternative \nstrategies were fraught with risk but were, nevertheless, unable to find a resolution to \nthis decision dilemma. Also, the defensive mechanisms adopted by the top team \nwere found to be magnified by the dynamics of the CEO\u201fs personality which exhibited \na strong need for control [11-13]. Hodgkinson and Wright  argued that their scenario \nintervention merely served to undermine the CEO\u201fs self-perception of her own self-\nefficacy to shape the destiny of her company. By contrast, in the present case study, \nthe CEO\u201fs strong positive view of the need to expand production was unchanged by \n 4 \nthe views of other members of the top management team \u2013 when these views were \nsurfaced in the pre-intervention interviews. The detail of the viewpoints of the CEO \nand the other members of the team are explored and explicated, in detail, later. \n \nIn the next sub-section we document the theoretical utility of scenario planning as an \nintervention that has the ability to challenge business-as-usual thinking. In a \nsubsequent section, we give background to our case analysis. As we shall see, the \ncase organization\u201fs degree-of-expansion decision was anchored [14-15] on the \ndemand forecasts of the major customer, such that as these forecasts changed so \ndid the degree-of-expansion decision. After this explication of the case context, we \ndetail our methodological approach to our interview analysis using the two \nframeworks (i.e., Janis and Mann; Maitlis and Lawrence) and then, finally, we present \nour analysis and conclusions. \n \n1.1 Overcoming strategic inertia with scenario planning \nThe process of scenario planning provides, in principle, an apt framework through \nwhich the appropriateness of a particular strategy or range of strategic options can \nbe tested for environmental fit and robustness. Additionally, since the essence of \nscenario thinking is to examine a range of plausible, alternative futures, the process \nintervention facilitates the expression of dissenting opinion within the organisation as \nto what the future may hold and challenges potentially inappropriate confidence in \nterms of both a single-point future and a single, tried-and-trusted strategy. Simple \nextrapolations of the past and single-point best guesses about the evolving state of \nthe external environment are thus attenuated, and the degree of alignment between \nstrategy and a range of futures becomes the focus of attention [16]. For a fuller \naccount of scenarios and the scenario process, see [3, 16-19]. Wiltbank et al [20] \nargued that scenario planning enhances adaptability in the organization \u2013 such that \nstrategy is less dependent on any one prediction. Further, Hutzschemreuter & \n 5 \nKleindienst [21] argued that \u201cthe long-term success of an organization is increasing \nbased on knowledge, accumulation and sharing\u2026 strategy processes that are \ndesigned to leverage the potential of human capital accumulated within the \norganization are the key for competitive advantage.\u201d (p 709). By our analysis, \nscenario planning has the capability, in principle, to provide such insight and value to \nthe organisation. In fact, in very many applications of the method, we have been \nsuccessful in producing what we term an \u201corganizational  jolt\u201d , leading to a re-think of \nstrategy \u2013 see [16, 22-24] for descriptions of our past successes. \n \nIt is interesting to note contemporary examples of strategic inertia in the recent world \nfinancial crisis. As late as March 16th, 2008, the US Secretary of the Treasury  stated \n\u201cI have great, great, confidence in our capital markets \u2026 (they are) strong \u2026 resilient \n\u2026 efficient \u2026 flexible\u201d. On July 15th, 2008, the President of the USA stated \u201c \u2026 we \ncan have confidence in the long-term foundation of our economy \u2026 I think the \nsystem is basically sound. I truly do\u201d Yet, on September 23rd  2008, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury said \u201c The market turmoil that we are experiencing today poses great \nrisks to US taxpayers\u201d. On September 24th 2008, the president said \u201c.. our entire \neconomy is in danger\u201d, as he urged Congress to pass the $700 billion bailout. See \nMakridakis, Hogarth, and Gaba for an insightful analysis of these contemporary \nissues [25]. In our view, adoption of scenario thinking in the US government would \nhave provided a challenge to business-as-usual thinking in the first half of 2008.See \nWright and Goodwin [26] for more detail on the use of scenario thinking to enhance \npreparedness for the occurrence of rare events. \n \n2.0 Background to the case analysis \nIn January 2005, Alpha-a, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha, had established itself \nas a major player in the specialised-engine management unit business. The \u201cengine \nmanagement unit\u201d is an electronic component that monitors and adjusts engine \n 6 \nsystems to cope efficiently and effectively with varied operating environments. As a \nconsequence of sustained economic growth, especially in Asia, sales of engine \nmanagement units were growing at 10% (compound annual average growth rate) \nand the existing manufacturing capacity at Alpha\u2013a was deemed unlikely to meet the \ndemands of the future. \n \nFollowing a review of the specialised-engine industry and market worldwide, of which \nengine management units were a major part, Alpha embarked upon a plan to raise in \nexcess of $34M to expand the production capacity to approximately 100,000 units a \nyear from the existing capacity of approximately 20,000 units per year. This \ninvestment represented the largest single investment in the company\u201fs thirty-year \nhistory.  \n \nIn May 2005, having failed to raise the necessary funds for the expansion of \nproduction from conventional sources of investment, the board took the decision to \nsell the most profitable division of Alpha (Alpha-b) for approximately $250M. The \nraised cash would result in a return to the shareholders, the elimination of debt, and \nfunds for the expansion.  \n \nIn June 2005 a reappraisal of the assumptions and data used to justify the five-fold \nexpansion suggested that a more modest expansion might be appropriate. As a \nconsequence of these uncertainties the company decided to re-evaluate its position, \nwith three levels of expansion proposed: 55,000 units per year, 75,000 units per year \nand 100,000 units per year, over a three year period. In repositioning the levels of the \nexpansion and the necessary funds to achieve each target production run, the \ndecision to sell Alpha-b was brought into question. \n \n 7 \nIn August 2005, the scenario intervention took place in order to re-visit the decision to \nexpand capacity.   \n \nSince the decision to expand the manufacturing facility had already been taken. The \nonly decision to be taken post August 2005 was, \u201cto what level does the expansion \nproceed?\u201d.  The driving motivation behind the expansion was the demand forecasts \nof Alpha-a\u201fs major customer. At the end of 2004, Alpha-a\u201fs major customer predicted \nthat the \u201f06 run-rate would be 5000 units per month, the equivalent of a total capacity \nof 75,000 units per year (this number includes other customers and contingency \nplanning).  However, the major customer had adjusted his forecasts to, variously, \n4200, 3000, 3675, and 2700 units\/month in the time-period November 2004 to \nAugust 2005. As noted, the scenario planning exercise began in August 2005. Figure \n1 shows the time-line of the customer\u201fs forecasts - paired with the unfolding of the \nAlpha-a\u201fs decision making on expansion. Clearly, Alpha-a\u201fs degree-of-expansion \ndecision making was closely tied to the customer\u201fs (changing) forecasts of demand. \nAs such, there is strong evidence for the \u201canchoring trap\u201d [15] in the forecasts of \nAlpha-a. \n \n \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n \n \n2.1 Analysis of the Investment Prospectus \nThe Investment Prospectus, produced in January 2005, provides the best source of \ndata to understand the decision to expand manufacturing of engine management \nunits. As we shall document, the Prospectus was a highly optimistic piece of work. \n \n 8 \nOne table contained in the January 2005 Investment prospectus estimated the share \nof the specialised engine business for Alpha-a\u201fs customers. Most noticeably, the type \nof specialised engine was omitted and the major customer was expected to have \n55% of the market share by 2006. By contrast, a recent market survey (in 2006) \nsuggested that the specialised engine business was divided into four categories and \nonly in one type was Alpha-a\u201fs \u201cMajor Customer\u201d shown to lead; with 42% of the sub-\nmarket. In fact, the majority of the data in the Investment Prospectus was provided by \nthe major customer. \n \nAnother table in the Investment Prospectus revealed that Alpha-a expected to \ncapture 100% of out-sourced production for all customers. The Prospectus also \nincluded estimates of the percentage of engine management units outsourced. The \nprospectus forecast that Alpha-a would control 87% of the world\u201fs specialised-\nengine, engine management unit market. Intuitively, It would seem highly unlikely \nthat major OEMs in the specialised engine market would allow one company to \ncontrol this level of the world market from a single facility - the supply-chain risks \nwould be too great. \nIn estimating that Alpha-a would achieve 100% of the outsourced engine \nmanagement units for specialised-engines, the Investment Prospectus neglected \ncompetitor behaviour. Indeed, recent press (January 2006) releases indicate that \ncompetitor manufacturers are now expanding to address the same market. \nKahneman and Lovallo [27] document \u201ccompetitor neglect\u201d as a major cause of \nunrealistic optimism in strategic decision making. \n \nIn fact, Alpha-a had never covered its costs since the initial purchase of the \nmanufacturing capability in 1998. To address this deficit, the strategy adopted in \n2004 was to use volume manufacturing to cover its costs and generate profit on high \n 9 \nmargin low-volume products that would naturally benefit from the high-volume \nmanufacturing equipment and philosophy. \n \nNo matter how detailed the Investment Prospectus had been it could not have dealt \nwith the forecast changes in demand detailed in Figure 1. The major customer \nchanged its demanded run-rate seven times in as many months. The January 2005 \nInvestment Prospectus had attempted to forecast demand and, with hindsight, was \nseen to fail. This lack of correspondence between forecasts and unfolding events \nshould, logically, have tempered the over-optimistic forecasts of Alpha-a [25] and, to \nan extent, it did \u2013 since the lack of correspondence provided the backdrop to the \nscenario planning intervention. Perhaps scenario planning could enable the company \nto create better strategy after evaluating, more comprehensively, the nature of the \nfuture. This was the back-drop to the scenario intervention that we describe next. In \nmid-2005, the company decided to use scenario planning to look in to the future in \norder to understand the uncertainties of the specialised engine business by \nexamining the external environmental factors that influence demand. \n \nIn summary, Alpha-a\u201fs forecasts of the likely future demand for engine-management \nsystems was anchored on the (changing) forecasts of its major customer. There was \nalso evidence of unrealistic optimism in the forecasts. Hammond et al [15] provide \nseveral recommendations for reducing such bias \u2013 focussing on seeking \u201c \u2026 \ninformation and opinions from a variety of people to widen your frame of reference \nand to push your mind in fresh directions\u201d (page 121). In this way, you can \u201c\u2026 \nuncover errors in thinking before they become errors in judgment\u201d (page 135). As \nalready noted, scenario planning provides, in principle, such a challenge to business-\nas-usual thinking. \n \n3.0 The Scenario planning Intervention \n 10 \nThe scenario planning intervention followed the \u201cDriving Forces\u201d technique [16,26]. \nThe project\u201fs scope was to examine the future external environment against which \nAlpha-a\u201fs planned facility expansion would be judged. As an ongoing exercise within \nthe company, Alpha-a was, at the time of the scenario planning intervention, \nexamining its competitive position using both SWOT and other strategy analyses. \nA scenario planning intervention challenges the status quo and promotes free-\nthinking. This process necessitates the acceptance that different views and opinions \nexist concerning the same issues and thus the process encompasses multiple \nperspectives - often stemming from the different cultural, ideological and disciplinary \nbackgrounds of participants. Scenario thinking enhances the analysis of perceived  \ncausal linkages between environmental factors that appear, on the surface, as \nunrelated.  \n \nIn stimulating atypical thinking and acting as \u201cagent provocateur\u201d, the scenario \nplanning exercise \u201cdeliberately provokes a high degree of turbulence within the \nparticipating group\u201d [16]. The procedure followed in the scenario planning exercise is \nthat offered by Van der Heijden et al. in \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d [16, Chapter 7]. The \nreader is directed to this text for a more in-depth treatment with further examples. \n \nThe first stage of the scenario planning exercise is to define the problem. Van der \nHeijden et al. [16 p. 192] refer to this, generically, as \u201cidentifying knowledge gaps\u201d. \nWithin the context of this project this was straightforward:  to what capacity level \nshould the expansion rise? Inherent within this is the assumption that the higher level \naims \u2013 i.e., the strategic direction of the company - had already been set. Thus, at \nthe outset of the scenario planning exercise (August 2005), the objective of the \nexercise was relatively well defined. \n \n 11 \n3.1 The Scenario Timeline \nThe scenario planning exercise had an intended duration of about ten to twelve \nweeks with fully constructed scenarios expected by December 2005. Figure 2 shows \na model scenario project program lasting ten weeks. Figure 3 shows the actual \nproject timeline. It includes key events that tended to temporarily derail the project \nand ultimately caused it to over-run. The reasons why the project overran will be \ndiscussed in subsequent sections. \n \n \nInsert Figures 2 and 3 about here \n \n \n \n \n3.2 The Scenario Team \nThe scenario team must have decision authority within the organization and, in our \nintervention, consisted the board of directors: The chief executive officer (CEO), the \nmanaging director (MD), the financial director (FD), the director of strategy (SD), the \ndirector of engineering (ED) and the chief technology officer (CTO). One director, the \nnewly appointed operations director, felt he was too busy, since he was new to the \nindustry and organization, to play an active role. The authority of the team appeared \nto be axiomatic. Their participation seemed to signify the importance of the task and \ntheir willingness to be interviewed, in the knowledge that interviews would be \nrecorded on tape, exhibited an openness that gave no indication of the problems that \nlay ahead. \n \n 12 \n3.3 Interviews with the Directors of Alpha-a \nThe second stage of the scenario exercise is \u201cexploring the scenario context\u201d. This \ncould have been achieved by simply bringing the team together in a single room and \nstating the goal of the project. However, this has the deleterious effect of constraining \nthe thinking of the team [16], and therefore a favoured approach is to start the \nprocess with a number of private interviews [cf 22,23]. The interviews with the \nscenario project team members are intended to capture horizons of thinking by \nallowing each member of the team to voice their views in private and with a \nguarantee of anonymity. The anonymous nature of the interviews is an important \nfactor since it allows issues that may not be raised in public to be surfaced to the \nfacilitator. These elicited views express how each member of the team sees the \ncompany moving forward and how it will interact with the future competitive \nenvironment. The six directors were interviewed in private. The interview was \ninitiated with a five-minute introduction to the concept of the scenario planning \nexercise. The confidential nature of the statements and resultant anonymity was \nstressed to encourage candour. Each participant was asked seven questions.  \n \nThese \u201ctrigger\u201d questions used to elicit information from those interviewed in Alpha-a \ncase are given in Table 1. These are known, in the scenario literature, as the \u201e7 \nQuestions\u201f [3]. They are generalized questions concerning the future, present and \npast of the organization - within the context of the external environment. These \nquestions were also utilised in the case analyses presented by Hodgkinson and \nWright [10]. The interviews were taped and then transcribed. \n \n \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \n 13 \n \nIn addition to the six formal interviews, a number of unstructured conversations were \ncarried out with leading technical and managerial staff about the future external \nenvironment. The outcome of the analysis of the formal interview transcripts was a \nwritten Report circulated to the scenario team. It allowed an \u201call inclusive view of the \norganization and its environment\u201d [16]. The interview transcripts included over one-\nhundred pages of text and the Report grouped quotations from the interviewees on \nparticular issues and concerns where a variety of viewpoints existed. The headings \nfor the groupings were \u201cOrganisation\u201d (including sub-groupings of corporate \nstructure, people, leadership, and morale), \u201cPolitics\u201d (including UK and worldwide), \n\u201cOperations\u201d (including the manufacturing facility, efficiency, production versus R&D, \ncustomer facing, and supply-chain), \u201cStrategic\u201d (including in-the-past, here-and-now, \nexpansion, and the future), \u201cStakeholders\u201d, \u201cTechnology\u201d, Economics\u201d, Environment\u201d, \n\u201cMarketing\u201d, and \u201cDecisions\u201d.  Statements made by individuals were made \nanonymous and then placed in what, intuitively seemed to be the most appropriate \ncategory. The reader of the Report was thus in a position to see the degree of \nconvergence \u2013 or divergence \u2013 of the views of the interviewees on a particular issue \nor concept. The written Report was circulated to the team in early October 2005. The \nReport was twenty-two pages in length and  sample page is shown in Figure 4. \n \n \nInsert Figure 4 about here \n \n \nAs mentioned earlier, the scenario planning exercise was expected to \u201cprovoke \nturbulence within the participating group\u201d: this was clearly stated in the introduction to \nthe Interview Report and this is what it did.  The Report demonstrated the level of \n 14 \ndivergence of opinion, within the board of directors, on how the company should \ndevelop in the future. It was after the Report was circulated that the scenario process \nstarted to stall.  \n \nMuch of the literature on scenario interventions gives the impression that the \napplication of a prescriptive process intervention will naturally lead to a successful \noutcome without recognition of the limitations and problems encountered. There is a \ndistinct lack of literature covering unsuccessful interventions (the only exceptions \nbeing Hodgkinson and Wright [10]; Maitlis and Lawrence [9]. \n \n4.0 Why did the process intervention fail to meet its objectives? \nWe examine this question in light of two conceptual frameworks. The first is the \nConflict Theory of Decision Making [8]. The second is that of Maitlis and Lawrence \n[9], who present a \u201ctheoretical framework for understanding failure in processes of \norganizational strategizing\u201d based on their experiences with a British Symphony \norchestra. \n \n \n4.1 Analysis of the interview data using the Conflict Theory of Decision-\nMaking) \n \nThe sheer size of the expansion (especially in terms of investment) may, in our view, \nhave caused high levels of anxiety and stress in members of the top management \nteam. For this reason, the psychology of the directors involved in the process \nintervention is next analysed using the Conflict Theory of Decision Making [8]. Our \nmethodological approach is identical to that of Hodgkinson and Wright [10] - in that it \nlooks at the only source of primary data; namely the interview transcripts.  \n \n 15 \nJanis and Mann [8] provide a comprehensive account of decision processes that are \nengendered in response to decision dilemmas, and as such their theory could, \npotentially, account for the case findings of strategic inertia.  The theory describes a \nnumber of basic patterns of coping with a challenge, be it a threat or an opportunity. \nIntense conflicts, Janis and Mann argue, are likely to arise whenever an individual \nhas to make an important decision. Such conflicts become acute as the decision \nmaker becomes aware of the risk of suffering serious losses from whatever course of \naction is selected. Decisional conflicts in this context refer to simultaneous opposing \ntendencies within the individual to accept or reject a given course of action. The most \nprominent symptoms of such conflicts are hesitation, vacillation, feelings of \nuncertainty and signs of acute emotional stress whenever a decision comes within \nthe focus of attention.  \n \nAccording to Janis and Mann, several types of decisional behavior called \u201ecoping \npatterns\u201f are the direct result of the conflict. Only one coping pattern, vigilance, \nresults in the careful search for and use of information in the face of a challenge. A \nprecondition for vigilance is that the decision makers must have concluded that \namongst other things, a better solution(s) does exist and that there is adequate time \nto debate and search for it - the result of which is a moderate level of stress. \nHypervigilance, a second coping pattern, results when the decision makers are \naware that a better solution probably does exist, but perceive that they have \ninsufficient time to engage in a search for it. Defensive avoidance behaviour, a third \ncoping pattern, arises when the perception is that no better solution exists other than \nthe current course of action, and can take one of three forms: procrastination which \ninvolves postponing the decision; buck passing which involves shifting the \nresponsibility of the decision to someone else; and bolstering which includes \nexaggerating the favourable consequences of the current course of action and \nminimizing the unfavourable consequences. Bolstering, as an observable behavior, \n 16 \nshares characteristics with non-rational escalation of commitment but the \nmechanisms that are theorised to induce this behavior are separable. \n \nBoth hypervigilance and defensive avoidance are preceded by high stress, since \nthere is recognition that the risks associated with adhering to the current option(s) are \nserious. Unconflicted adherence, a fourth coping pattern, is preceded by low stress, \nsince here the decision maker views the current course of action as unthreatened \nand the outcomes associated with alternative courses of action as inconsequential. \nSearch for information regarding the consequences of changing a decision is minimal \nand, since no risks are thought to be associated with it, the current course of action is \nadhered to. Unconflicted change, a fifth coping pattern, is also preceded by low \nstress since here a threatened current course of action can be replaced by an \nalternative, unthreatened course of action. Figure 5 details the essential elements of \nthis theoretical model, as related to the current context of strategic decision making. \n \nInsert Figure 5 about here \n \n \n4.1.2 Interview coding \nIn order to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the interview transcripts we used an \na priori scheme comprising 14 categories, which collectively embrace the full range \nof concepts employed within the Janis and Mann conflict theory of decision making \n[10].  An additional miscellaneous category was added to the coding scheme to allow \nfor the possibility that none of the categories derived from this theory were \napplicable. The coding scheme is presented in full in Table 2. \n \n 17 \nInitially, the researchers read through the set of original interview transcripts and \nhighlighted interviewee responses, or \u201equotations\u201f, that were, plausibly, illustrations of \nthe various aspects of Janis and Mann\u201fs theory. The highlighted responses were \nthen allocated to one of the 14+1, a-priori, categories as considered appropriate, any \ndisagreement between the researchers as to category allocation being resolved \nthrough discussion. \n \nTo the best of our knowledge our analysis of the interview transcripts was \nexhaustive. However in order to ensure that we had not inadvertently overlooked any \nmaterial of potential relevance, we explained the Janis and Mann theory to two post-\ngraduate research assistants. They were then given them a copy of the categories \nshown in Table 2, and instructed to independently:  \n \n\u201c\u2026 read through each of the 6 interview transcripts and indicate any additional \nphrases, sentences or paragraphs that you believe could be plausibly allocated to \nany of the 14 categories (you are not required to actually allocate them, merely to \nindicate which phrase\/sentence\/paragraph deals with decisional issues that could \nbe categorised into one or more of the 14 categories).\u201d \n \nOur approach replicates the approach taken in Hodgkinson and Wright [10]. As \nexpected, the research assistants identified very few additional quotations.  \n \nThe analysis in the Alpha-a case was based on a total of 64 quotations identified \nthrough this exercise. In the text of this paper, we selectively allocate the 64 \nquotations in order to illustrate those aspects of Janis and Mann\u201fs theory that we \nbelieve are identified within the dataset. Our interpretation is necessarily subjective, \nHowever, given that all 64 quotations are documented across the Tables attached to \n 18 \nthis paper, readers are in a position to reflect on the extent to which they agree or \ndisagree with our account of the data. \n \n \nInsert Table 2 about here \n \n \n4.1.3 Findings \nWill Alpha-a be at serious risk  if it doesn't change its current strategy? \n \nFive of the interviewed participants presented a view that the short-term strategy \nbeing operated \u2013 i.e., the in-principle decision to expand production in line with the \nmajor customer\u201fs view of its future needs - was damaging the long-term future of the \ncompany as illustrated by the following remark:  \n \n\u2018I don\u2019t think we are doing  much significant research and I think that even within 5 \nyears the company is jeopardised by that short term view.' (ED) \n \nOnly the CEO did not vocalise that the expansion of manufacturing production was \nrisky.  The comments of the other directors presented in Table 3. Therefore, the \nanswer to the above question would appear to be \u201cyes\u201d. \n \n \nInsert Table 3 about here \n \n \nWill the risks to Alpha-a  be serious if it does change its current strategy?  \n 19 \n \nThat the organization was dependent on one customer is illustrated in the following \nquotation,  \n\u2018\u2026 at the moment we are a one trick pony.' (FD) \n \nThis situation seems to be further exasperated by the fact that most directors didn\u201ft \nbelieve all the business activities were up to scratch - consequently making a change \nin the business model (away from volume manufacturing) difficult and risky - as \ndemonstrated by the comments presented in Table 4. \n \n \nInsert Table 4 about here \n \n \nIs it realistic to hope to find a better solution for Alpha-a's current strategic dilemmas? \n \nThe answer to this question is not simple. One might argue \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. On the \none hand, some directors believed there was hope but felt more \u201cinfluential\u201d directors \nwere ignoring their opinions, thus those who were supportive of an alternative \nstrategy were being marginalised. On the other hand, there was a belief that the \nmajor problem was that the operation of the business was running against the \n\u201cstated\u201d strategy and the \u201cexecuted\u201d strategy was damaging the longevity of the \ncompany. As noted earlier, the stated strategy was to use the volume engine \nmanagement unit manufacturing business (a low margin product) to maintain the \nfacility\/infrastructure (that is, used to pay the bills) with priority given to develop new \nproducts (with higher margin) and new revenues. \n \n 20 \nThe executed strategy was to give priority to the major customer whose only interest \nwas the lower-margin engine-management-unit business.  \n \nAs illustrated by a statement from  the ED: \n\u2018\u2026if the strategy\u2019s how I believe it to be then we need to actually follow it because \u2026 \nat almost every opportunity of decision making the decisions actually go against the \n[stated] strategy.' (ED) \n \nFrom the authors\u201f perspective, it was obvious that a number of directors felt \nmarginalized and thus impotent to direct the company on a more sustainable path. \nThe CEO, who was the sole member of Alpha-a to sit on the executive board of \nAlpha, could not accept alternatives to the flawed \u201cexecuted\u201d strategy; although there \nappears to be a realisation, by the other directors,  that the present state of affairs \nwas unacceptable - as presented in Table 5. \n \n \nInsert Table 5 about here \n \n \nShifting Responsibility \nThe marginalization of a number of directors provided an excuse to blame others for \nthe position the organization found itself in. This shifting of responsibility was also \nevident in those directors who appeared to have maintained their influence. There \nwas frequent use of the word \u201cwe\u201d, meaning the directors, when it appeared that this \nshould have been \u201cI\u201d.  The MD was quite honest about shifting the blame: \n \n 21 \n'I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be much help, other than to\u2026 because I wasn\u2019t party to a \nlot of that. So that was pulled together essentially by the FD and the SD, I\u2019d made \ninput with [the operations manager at the time]\u2019s help in terms of tool cost and things \nlike that. I think what everybody said at the time, and we can blame [the former CEO] \nfor that, because [he\u2019s] gone, was that these numbers are just far too big.' (MD)) \nThere were a number of instances where responsibility for the issues was deflected \nor deferred to others, - shown in Table 6. \n \n \nInsert Table 6 about here \n \n \nIn some cases this extended to entities outside the company. On a number of \noccasions participants expressed the opinion that the company\u201fs best future lay in \nthe hands of another company - as presented in Table 7. \n \n \nInsert Table 7 about here \n \n \nProcrastination \nShifting responsibility is recognized as a defensive avoidance strategy, as is \nprocrastination. There were many references in all interview transcripts to \u201cwe have \nto\u201d, or \u201cwe need to\u201d. The use of the future tense was pervasive in the transcripts - as \ndocumented in Table 8.  \n \n \n 22 \nInsert Table 8 about here \n \nBolstering \nAlthough there was a general acceptance that elements of the present situation had \nto change there seemed a reluctance to do so as evidenced in the statements \nillustrating procrastination. At the same time there was strong support for the current, \nfailing operational strategy \u2013 see Table 9. \n \n \nInsert Table 9 about here \n \n \nIt appears, therefore, that the directors of Alpha-a exhibit all three of the defensive \navoidance strategies postulated by Janis and Mann [8]. That these avoidance \nstrategies had a negative impact on \u201cinformation search\u201d and \u201ccontingency planning\u201d \nis illustrated in the following Tables - 10 and 11.  \n \n \nInsert Table 10 about here \nInsert Table 11 about here \n \n \nThe above analysis demonstrates the operation of elements of the defensive \navoidance mechanisms predicted by the Conflict Theory of Janis and Mann [8]. Our \nfindings would also tend to support the assertion that these defensive strategies were \nengaged as a result of stress induced by an acceptance that the expansion decision \nwas fraught with risk. The timing of the scenario process intervention could not have \n 23 \nbeen worse. The divestiture of the Alpha-b business was high in the consciences of \nthe directors. The loss of the major part of Alpha\u201fs business was going to have a \nlarge effect on the form of Alpha-a. This was evidenced by the following statement \nfrom the CEO: \n\u2018A very large part of the business is going to be sold and we will end up with a new \nshape of company.'   (CEO) \n \n4.2 Analysis of the interview data using the Maitlis and Lawrence framework \nMaitlis and Lawrence [9] presented a \u201ctheoretical framework for understanding failure \nin processes of organizational strategizing\u201d based on their experiences with a British \nSymphony orchestra. We next turn to us their framework to see if it provides \nadditional insights on our interview analysis. We proceed by stating Maitlis and \nLawrence\u201fs main propositions and then relate these, in turn, to our case materials. \n \nProposition 1a: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when key \nactors do not interpret the issue as relevant to their situation and as having \nthe potential to further their own interests. \n \nWhether the background of uncertainty that pervaded the organization during the \ntiming of the process intervention distracted those involved is difficult to say. \nCertainly there was an undercurrent that the directors had more important things to \ndo than participate in the workshops. As we noted earlier, for the newly-appointed \nOperations director, getting to know the business was more important than being \ninvolved in the scenario intervention process. It may have been that, with the \ndivestiture of the Alpha-b business, the directors saw a management system that \nwas top-heavy; as demonstrated by the following quote, \n \n 24 \n \u2018I think we actually have too many Chiefs and not enough Indians ... and [we] \nprobably [need] some thinning down.' (ED) \nThus, fearful of redundancy, some participants could have chosen to \u201clook busy\u201d \n(keep their heads down) rather than participate in a tangental scenario planning \nexercise. Nevertheless, the CEO, MD, FD, SD, CTO and ED all volunteered to take \npart. \n \nProposition 1b: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail if the issue \nis not interpreted and labeled in a way that is legitimate within the existing \norganizational discourse. \n \nOne feature of the interview transcripts was the perceived lack of a coordinated, and \nunanimous, strategy. A number of the participants took the view that a higher-level \nstrategy for the expansion decision was missing and as such the lower level decision \nabout the degree of expansion \u2013 the focal issue of the scenario intervention - was \ninappropriate, as illustrated by the following statement, \n \n\u2018I think we do have a definite strategy but at almost every opportunity of decision \nmaking the decisions actually go against [it].' (ED) \n \nTo recap, the stated, higher-level, strategy of Alpha-a was, in fact, to use the volume \nengine management unit manufacturing business (a low-margin product) to maintain \nthe extant facility\/infrastructure in order to give priority to efforts to develop new \nproducts and revenue streams.  \n \nProposition 2a: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when the \norganizational politics preclude agreement on the definition of the concept, \nand there exists no actor powerful enough to impose a definition. \n 25 \n \nWithin the interview transcripts, there was evidence of fundamentally different views \nof what was important for the future of the company. In addressing the interview \nquestion, \u201cWhat are the decisions to be made today?\u201d, some directors  viewed the \n\u201cnext step\u201d very differently (Table 12).  \n \n \nInsert Table 12 about here \n \n \nBy January 2006 the two directors (the FD and the SD) had left the company and two \nothers (the CTO and ED) were, effectively, demoted.  \n \nProposition 2b: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when the \npreexisting discursive resources of key actors are highly incompatible. \n \nIn line with proposition 2b, there was a heterogeneity in the business backgrounds of \nthe team of directors - see Table 13. \n \n \n Insert Table 13 about here \n \n \nProposition 3a: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when \norganizational politics do not allow for the assignment of responsibility and \naccountability in a way that benefits key actors. \n \n 26 \nThe subject of authority and responsibility seemed a common problem; there were \nsigns that authority was not fully clearly defined within the organization (Table 14). \n \n \nInsert Table 14 about here \n \n \n \nProposition 3b: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when the \nconcept definition is highly complex and internally inconsistent. \n \nIt is difficult to argue that the issue of the \u201cnext step\u201d for Alpha-a was too complex to \nbe discussed and analysed within the scenario intervention. What was inconsistent \nwere the opinions of the directors on how to move the company forward - see \nProposition 2a, above. \n \nProposition 4: An episode of strategizing will be more likely to fail when the \nconcept has been defined in terms of the organization\u2019s weaknesses rather \nthan its strengths. \n \nSeveral of the participants thought that the expansion of Alpha-a was poorly \nconceived since the future success of the decision was founded on a perceived \nweakness in the organization - namely its operational capability. The expansion was \nabout becoming a major player in the volume business but Alpha-a\u201fs existing \nsuccess was perceived to lie in clever solutions, not in volume production (Table 15).  \n \n \n 27 \nInsert Table 15 about here \n \n \nIn summary, application of the Maitis & Lawrence [9] framework to the interview data \nrevealed some support for their propositions about why processes involved in \norganisational strategising can fail.  Specifically, the directors may (1) have been \nmore focussed on keeping their jobs rather than participating in the scenario \nexercise, (2) the directors did not agree an over-arching strategy and so discussion \nof the degree of expansion lacked legitimacy, (3) the directors disagreed about the \nnature of the decision facing them, (4) the directors were heterogeneous in their \nbackgrounds and (5) the nature of authority\/responsibility\/accountability in Alpha and \nAlpha-a was moot.  In short, there is some evidence that the set of ambient \ndiscursive and political factors were in-appropriate for strategising success.   \n \n5.0 What, then, can be learned from our analysis of this case intervention? \n \n5.1 implications for theory \nThe first point is that scenario planning is one, well-utilised, way of exploring \ndifferences in perceptions of the business environment with a management team.  \nBut, to initiate this, perceptions need to be shared \u2013 and it was at the early stage of \nthe sharing of perceptions where this scenario intervention failed.  It is worth re-\nstating that, in the Report containing the clustered interview quotations, each \nquotation was made anonymous and that thus the directors would not have been \nable to recognise one another \u2013 unless, of course, the degree and nature of \nindividual\u201fs disserting opinions were already salient to the other Directors in the \norganisation.  Given that the range of divergent opinions\/views were now salient to \neach of the directors, four of the directors decided not to continue. Why?  Rationally, \nit would have made sense to continue and make a thorough evaluation of the \n 28 \ndecision to expand \u2013 given the emergent salience of alternate views on the issue. \nAnd, this is the exact remedy recommended [15, 27] to overcome the pitfalls of \noverconfidence, inappropriate anchoring, and the inappropriate search for confirming \nevidence for the adequacy of an already-made decision.  But the MD, the ED, and \nthe FD dropped out.  Even the CEO dropped out.  Only the SD and the CTO \ncontinued their involvement onto the next workshop.  Why were members of the top \nteam unwilling to continue their engagement with the scenario process?  It is our \nbelief that the weight of evidence indicates that further continuation was seen by all \nparticipants, including the CEO, as likely to lead to a serious questioning of the, \nalready-made, decision to expand production.  As such, the whole top-level strategy \nof the firm, including the sale of Alpha-b would be under intense scrutiny.  But this \nissue could not be faced and so both the CEO and some of those directors with \ndoubts about (1) the viability of the expansion decision and (2) the viability of the \ncontinuation of their own jobs decided to lower their heads below the parapet.  \nNevertheless, the scenario intervention continued with the ongoing involvement of \ntwo Directors. The four scenarios that were subsequently developed utilised two, \nhigh-impact, low-predictability clusters as the scenario dimensions. These were (i) \nhigh economic growth \u2013 stalled economic growth, and (ii) legislative support for EU-\nbased high-technology manufacturing \u2013 legislative inhibition of EU-based high-\ntechnology manufacturing.  The scenarios considered (a) civilian and military markets \nfor the engine management systems in Asia, North America and Europe, (b) \ntechnology change, and (c) environmental issues. The scenarios that were eventually \nconstructed by a team, including the SD and CTO, showed that the expansion \ndecision was fragile against these scenarios and that other decision options were, in \nfact, dominant.   \n \nIn short, our case analysis illustrates that there was strong   \u201cpressure for a change\u201d \nin the currently-followed strategy and this pressure emanated from the Directors of \n 29 \nAlpha-a.  This pressure for change was revealed in the interview Report and made \nsalient to all the Directors. As such, the degree of inertia cannot, we posit, be linked \nto the operation of unconscious processes or, indeed, human cognitive limitations \nthat could be remedied by recommended techniques [15, 25].  The degree of \npressure for a change of strategy was obvious and salient to all. \n \nIn summary, all of the directors, apart from the CEO, saw the irrationality of \nexpanding production of the engine management units at the time that we conducted \ninterviews to set the scenario intervention process in motion. The pressure for a \nchange in strategy, as evidenced in the interview transcripts, was immense. But the \nresult of this pressure was neither a step change in strategy nor an incremental \nchange in strategy - as predicted by Huff et al [7, 5]. In fact there was no change in \nstrategy at all.  \n \nOur case study illustrates that inertia in strategic decision making can be extreme \u2013 \nmore extreme that the extant literature has recognised before. Our case analysis \ndoes not negate the conclusions of the earlier literature but extends and \ncomplements them with an existence demonstration of such an extreme.  As such, \n\u201cincreasing pressure for change\u201d may not produce a change in strategy. At the time \nof the distribution of the Interview Report, the individual directors were, arguably, \nunaware that the other directors were also not aligned to the executed strategy.  \nOnce aware of one-another\u201fs viewpoints, they did not combine to exert a joint, and \nperhaps multiplicatively strengthened, pressure for a change of strategy. An \nalternative route was taken to relieve the pressure \u2013 they dispersed. Thus, the \nstrategic episode captured in the scenario workshop did not invoke vigilant \nevaluations of alternative strategy options.  \n \n5.1 Implications for intervention practice \n 30 \nOur study provides an existence demonstration of the extent to which a senior \nmanagement team may persist in a chosen strategy despite the well-orchestrated \nintroduction of countervailing evidence. Strategy workshop practitioners should be \nsensitive to this demonstration. Critical voices can go unheard \u2013 even when these \nvoices are in the majority. \n \nOur process intervention stalled when the results of our preliminary interviews were \nfed-back in anonymous form to our interviewees. The questions posed in the \ninterviews were, on the face of it, fairly innocuous (see Table 1). As we have noted, \nthis was an exceptional outcome in our prior consultancy experience of successful \nscenario-based interventions utilising identical methodology. Could we have \npredicted this unusual response before our intervention?  \n \nRecall that the focus of our intervention was to evaluate the degree-of-expansion \ndecision rather than the expansion decision per-se. Our initial analysis of the \ninterview data in terms of Janis & Mann\u201fs conflict theory of decision making revealed \nevidence that all of the directors (with the exception of the CEO) perceived both the \ninitial decision to expand and consequential degree-of-expansion decision as fraught \nwith risk.  Additionally, change from this linked strategy was also perceived to be \nhazardous and any resolution the issues was not seen to be straightforward.  As \nsuch, as predicted by Janis & Mann model, the directors were found to have \nengaged psychological coping patterns to defensively avoid the decision dilemma \nwith which they were faced.  We found evidence of (i) shifting responsibility for \nresolving the decision dilemma, (ii) procrastination over resolving the decision \ndilemma, (iii) and bolstering of the current executed strategy - of keeping close to the \nmajor customer and expanding production of engine management units. As predicted \nby the Conflict Theory, we also found evidence of limited information search and poor \ncontingency planning for future eventualities.  These deficiencies and defects in \n 31 \ndecision making could not have been forecast a-priori. Additionally, we found \nevidence that, in agreement with the Maitlis and Lawrence framework, the set of \nambient discursive and political factors were in-appropriate for strategising success.  \nArguably, we also could not have known, a-priori, that our respondents would not be \nin agreement with the over-arching strategy to expand - such that discussion of the \ndegree of expansion lacked legitimacy. We also could not have known that the \nnature of authority\/responsibility\/accountability in Alpha and Alpha-a was moot. All \nthat we could have known, a-priori, was that the directors were heterogeneous in \ntheir backgrounds.  \n \nHowever, once we obtained the range of views on the over-arching strategy to \nexpand we could have taken this as a warning that, perhaps, the interview \nparticipants would not be prepared to deal with the conflict of viewpoints  that we \nwere to surface via our circulation of the anonymous interview quotations. Ronald \nHeifetz, a psychiatrist, has argued [28] that adaptive work is needed to allow group \nparticipants to be open about their individual viewpoints and facilitate change of \nopinion in stressful situations - such as the one that we encountered. Successful \nleaders, and perhaps scenario practitioners, need to be able to gauge how far to \ncognitively and emotionally challenge individuals in the process of enabling vigilant \ndecision making. Clearly, in our case example, the executives were not ready to \nreceive the challenge presented in the summarised interview notes. In hindsight, \nperhaps we should have diverted from the standard scenario intervention process at \nthis point and not shared the interview notes. Perhaps we should have proceeded \ndirectly to the scenario construction process in order to build, gradually, a common \nmind-set in our participants. Clearly, the yield of the pre-intervention interviews \ndeserves close attention in future scenario interventions with top management \nteams. And application of the Janis and Mann\u201fs conflict theory of decision making \ndemonstrably provides a useful lens with which to analyse the interview material. \n 32 \n \nCould we have predicted the unusual response to the early stage of our scenario-\nplanning intervention? On reflection, we have no clear answer to this question. As we \nhave noted, at the time of our intervention, the divestiture of the Alpha-b business \nwas high in the consciences of the directors. The loss of the major part of Alpha\u201fs \nbusiness was going to have a large effect on the form of Alpha-a  and the directors, \nthemselves, were unsure of their future roles and responsibilities. If our respondents \nhad felt more secure in their roles then, perhaps, the scenario intervention process \nwould have continued with the involvement of all the initially-involved directors. \nPerhaps, also, the documented weight of the countervailing opinion about the \ndecision to expand production would have made this, already-taken, decision the \nsubject of vigilant decision making within an unfolding scenario process. We \nconclude that a scenario planning intervention has, in principle, the capability to \nprovide such insight and value to an organisation and, as such, can aid a top \nmanagement team to overcome pitfalls in decision making. But such benefits can be \nattenuated by an un-receptive organisational context \u2013 as documented in this case \nstudy.  \n \n \nPostscript \nBut what of the CEO? The financial report made by Alpha-a, at the end of the 2006 \nfinancial year, included a statement of the CEO\u201fs resignation \u2013 to be effective from \nthe the date of the next annual general meeting. What caused this resignation? \nSome events that followed the scenario intervention shed light on this subsequent \nevent. It transpired that shortly after the end of the scenario intervention the major \ncustomer refused to give a contractual commitment to Alpha-a for supply of engine \nmanagement units. In fact, the major customer eventually said that it wanted no more \n 33 \nengine management units from Alpha-a. Subsequently the planned expansion at \nAlpha-a was halted and about $7million was lost as deposits on the new equipment \nthat had been sourced for the expansion. At the time of writing, however, the major \ncustomer had again placed orders for engine management units \u2013 as a result of  \nfailures by  their other suppliers \u2013 and has ordered a limited number of units to be \nsupplied up until February 2007.
