STREVENS\nBigger Than Chaos: Understanding Complexity Through\nProbability\nCambridge (MA): Harvard University Press, 2003\n$76 (hardback), ISBN: 0674010426\nCharlotte Werndl\nThe Queen\u2019s College, Oxford University\ncharlotte.werndl@queens.ox.ac.uk\n1 Introduction\nThis book aims to explain, by appealing to the mathematical method of ar-\nbitrary functions (MAF) initiated by Hopf and Poincare\u00b4, how the many and\nvarious interactions of the parts of a complex system often result in simple\nprobabilistic patterns of behaviour. A complex system is vaguely defined\nas a system of many parts (called enions) which are somewhat autonomous\nbut strongly interacting; (italicised words are Strevens\u2019 jargon). Strevens\nsays that a system shows simple behaviour when it can be described math-\nematically with a small number of variables.1 A philosophical treatment of\ncomplex systems, the MAF, and the emergence of simple probabilistic pat-\nterns is welcome because these important topics have been rather neglected.\nThe book proceeds as follows: The Introduction (Chapter 1) is followed by\na discussion in Chapters 2 and 3 of the MAF. This discussion is divided into\nan informal part, where the results are explained, and a formal part where the\nresults are proven. Strevens\u2019 strategy here is to prove theorems from strong\nassumptions, and then to argue that they are approximately true if, more\nrealistically, the assumptions are approximately fulfilled. In Chapter 4 these\nresults are applied to explain the simplicity of complex systems. Finally,\nChapter 5 contains very brief remarks on the philosophical implications for\nthe higher-level sciences. No previous knowledge about complex systems or\n1Hence systems exhibiting deterministic chaos can show simple behaviour.\n1\nthe MAF is presupposed. Basic knowledge of probability theory suffices to\nunderstand the main arguments, and basic measure theory to master the\nformal parts.\nNevertheless, the discussion is interesting both to experienced readers and\nto novices. The book provides a good introduction to the MAF and contains\nsome interesting original material. However, the book promises more than\nit delivers: There are no convincing examples, and one\u2019s ultimate conclusion\nis that we do not yet know whether the book\u2019s proposed explanation of the\nsimple behaviour of complex systems succeeds. Furthermore, there are some\nconceptual lacunae and technical mistakes. Still, Strevens\u2019 arguments suggest\nat least a possible explanation of the simple behaviour of complex systems,\nand this is an important contribution given the difficulty of the task at hand.\nLet me go into the details. I will concentrate on the main chapters, Chapters\n2\u20134, and, in order to advance the discussion, I will focus on my objections.\n2 The Method of Arbitrary Functions\nStrevens calls the scheme for explaining simple behaviour that he advocates\nenion probability analysis (EPA). It consists of three stages. First, a proba-\nbility is assigned to events that a specific enion in a given microstate will next\nbe in a given macrostate, the (single microstate) enion probability ; where mi-\ncrostates describe all information about the enions and macrostates describe\nonly enion statistics. Assume that the probabilistic supercondition holds,\ni.e. that these enion probabilities depend only on macrostates, and that the\noutcomes of any two different enion probabilities are probabilistically inde-\npendent. Then, second, the enion probabilities can be aggregated, often by\napplying the law of large numbers, to yield probabilistic relations only be-\ntween macrostates. Third, a law about macrostates is derived from these\nprobabilities, which is simple because it makes no reference to microstates.\nMost of the book is concerned with showing, by appealing to the MAF, that\ncomplex systems satisfy the probabilistic supercondition.\nChapter 2 and the first part of Chapter 3 explain two core ideas of the\nMAF. Strevens\u2019 results here are a slight variation of classical results and are\nrather obvious once these results are known (see in particular Hopf [1934],\n[1936]; readers of this journal may also recall von Plato [1983]). His results\ndiffer because, Strevens argues, for the application to complex systems it is\nimportant not to consider limiting behaviour as the classical treatments do\n2\n(e.g. a limit in which time or the number of sections in a roulette wheel goes\nto infinity). Let me explain the two core ideas in Strevens\u2019 terms.\nFirst, consider a probabilistic experiment2 C consisting of a (i) determin-\nistic mechanism, such as the evolution function of a roulette wheel with 36\nequally spaced red and black sections; (ii) the variables V which provide ini-\ntial conditions for the mechanism, such as the initial angular velocity with\nwhich the roulette wheel is spun; (iii) a set of outcomes, such as \u2018landing\nred\u2019 and \u2018landing black\u2019 for the roulette wheel; and (iv) a density quanti-\nfying the frequency or probability of the possible values of V , such as the\nprobability density of initial angular velocities imparted to the wheel by a\ncroupier. Now assume that the experiment is microconstant relative to an\noutcome O, meaning that the space of possible values of V can be partitioned\ninto micro-sized contiguous sets such that across the different sets, the pro-\nportion of values which lead to O is a constant, called the strike ratio CO.\nThen for any density which is macroperiodic (meaning: constant on each set\nin the partition), the probability that the experiment yields O is CO. For\ninstance, the roulette wheel is microconstant relative to the outcome \u2018land-\ning red\u2019 because the space of possible values of initial angular velocities can\nbe partitioned into micro-sized contiguous sets such that across the different\nsets the proportion of velocities which lead to the outcome red is a constant,\nsay one half. If the density representing the initial angular velocity of the\ncroupier is constant on each set in the partition, then the probability of the\nexperiment landing red will be one half (even though the value of the density\ncan vary greatly from one set of the partition to another).\nStrevens (pp. 60\u20131) argues that all mechanisms of microconstant exper-\niments show sensitivity to initial conditions as usually understood in chaos\ntheory. It is true that microconstancy implies that there is some \u03b5 which we\nregard as small such that for any initial condition v1 there is an initial condi-\ntion v2 which is less than the distance \u03b5 apart from v1 and which yields the\nopposite outcome. However, it is not true that microconstant experiments\nalways show sensitivity to initial conditions as understood in chaos theory,\nnamely that for every \u03b5 and every initial condition v1 there is an initial con-\ndition v2 which is less than \u03b5 apart from v1 and which leads to a different\noutcome. For instance, imagine a roulette wheel whose position after t time\nunits is v+ t, where v represents the initial conditions, and where we choose\n2Despite the anthropomorphic word \u2018experiment\u2019, this need not involve any human\naction or intention.\n3\nv \u2208 [0, 1] and assume that the wheel has a circumference of 1; hence positions\nwhich differ by a natural number are identified. Assume that the wheel is\ndivided into 36 equally spaced red and black sections and that the mecha-\nnism is stopped after 34\n36\ntime units. Then the experiment is microconstant,\nbut solutions starting close together stay close for all times;3 hence very close\ninitial conditions nearly always lead to the same outcome.\nThe second core idea of the MAF has to do with the probabilistic inde-\npendence of two (or more) microconstant experiments. Given two causally\nisolated microconstant experiments C and D with strike ratios CO1 and DO2 ,\nStrevens defines combined experiments in such away that the combined ex-\nperiment is microconstant relative to the outcome O1 and O2 with strike\nratio CO1 and DO2 . It follows that if the joint density is macroperiodic, the\noutcomes are probabilistically independent.\nThe second part of Chapter 3 contains some new and interesting re-\nsults: most notably, that specific causal couplings of microconstant exper-\niments yield probabilistically independent outcomes and that some exper-\niments whose states are deterministically chained maintain macroperiodic\ndistributions and hence yield probabilistically independent outcomes. These\nresults hold under the additional assumptions that the transformation T rep-\nresenting the chaining mechanism or the causal coupling is strongly inflation-\nary, i.e. T maps every subset of its domain to a larger set, and is microlinear,\ni.e. T is linear or affine once restricted to any set of some partition of its\ndomain into contiguous micro-sized regions.\nThe main proofs in Chapters 2 and 3 are correct; but the discussion\nis sometimes strange; e.g., the term \u2018contiguous\u2019, which, as we have seen,\nfigures in important definitions is never formally defined (pp. 128, p. 134,\np. 220). What is more is that I have doubts about Approximation 3.18.3 of\nthe main theorem on deterministically chained experiments (p. 248). This\napproximation addresses the worry that when a transformation representing\nthe chaining that is only approximately microlinear is repeatedly applied to\na macroperiodic density, this may eventually result in a density which is not\neven approximately macroperiodic. Strevens argues that this worry is un-\nfounded because strongly inflationary transformations will tend to stretch out\nany area of non-macroperiodicity. But this is not convincing. For instance,\nfor the so-called exact systems, which include many strongly inflationary\n3In other examples differences in initial conditions can even shrink for microconstant\nexperiments.\n4\ntransformations, any initial density will (sometimes quickly) converge to the\ninvariant measure of the system. And many invariant measures are not ap-\nproximately macroperiodic (cf. Berger [2001], Chapter 4). This is problem\nis potentially serious because this approximation plays a crucial role in the\napplication to the complex systems in Chapter 4.\n3 Complex Systems\nIn the first part of Chapter 4 Strevens states general conditions under which,\nhe argues, the simple behaviour of complex systems can be explained. The\nevolution of complex systems is represented by sequences of microstates.\nGiven a microstate, the outcomes of many microdynamic probabilistic exper-\niments determine the next microstate. The formal results of Chapters 2 and 3\nare applied so as to conclude that the outcomes of these microdynamic prob-\nabilistic experiments are probabilistically independent. Strevens argues that\nthis implies that every (single microstate) enion probability depends only on\nmacrostates and that the outcomes of any two different enion probabilities\nare probabilistically independent. Thus the probabilistic supercondition is\nsatisfied, and EPA can be applied to obtain laws about macrostates.\nHere I should note that the title \u2018Bigger Than Chaos\u2019 and the discussion\nabout chaos is confusing because two different meanings of chaos (enions\ninteracting in many and various ways, and deterministic chaos as in chaos\ntheory) are conflated (p. 332). Deterministic chaos is not a main concern of\nthe book, although some results require strong inflation, which is sometimes\nfound, but neither necessary nor sufficient for deterministic chaos (Werndl\n[2009a], pp. 209\u2013211). What the title expresses is the main theme, viz.\nthat probabilities of microconstant experiments are indifferent to the de-\ntailed complicated micro-dynamics of complex systems and create simple\nbehaviour.\nThe general argument for the simplicity of complex systems simply as-\nsumes that microdynamic probabilistic experiments are microconstant and\nhave macroperiodic densities (pp. 278, p. 283). And it requires that the\ncoupling and the chaining transformations are strongly inflationary. All will\nagree that in the final analysis this has to be verified for each complex sys-\ntem. But we should note that Strevens\u2019 remark that strong inflation \u2018is in\nfact not such a rare thing\u2019 (p. 279) is controversial since this is a very strong\ncondition. For instance, although several very simple models of determinis-\n5\ntic chaos are strongly inflationary, many chaotic systems such as the logistic\nmap or the Lorenz system are not; and it is conjectured that more realistic\nchaotic models are typically not strongly inflationary (Smith et al. [1999],\npp. 2861\u20132).\nFurthermore, the crucial formal conclusion that the (single microstate)\nenion probabilities only depend on macrostates is established only informally\n(Section 4.4), leaving uncertainty whether the conclusion is true. Given that\nthe main results in Chapters 2 and 3 were really proven, one would have\nexpected proper formal results here also.\nMoreover, important paradigms of complex systems are what is often\ncalled self-organised systems, where enions interact much more strongly with\ntheir neighbours than with other enions (Camezine et al. [2001]). As Strevens\npoints out (p. 291), EPA alone cannot explain the simplicity of these systems.\nHere additionally other techniques, such as the renormalisation group, are\nneeded.\n4 Examples: Statistical Physics, Population Ecology\nand the Social Sciences\nIn the second part of Chapter 4 EPA is applied to concrete examples. In\nstatistical physics Strevens claims that, by considering the collision of par-\nticles in hard-sphere systems, the application of EPA yields the Maxwell-\nBoltzmann distribution, or at least the assumptions such as \u2018molecular chaos\u2019\nneeded to derive this distribution. And he spectulates that the same con-\nsiderations can be used to provide an understanding of all the dynamics\nproperties of gases, such as the tendency to equilibrium. These ideas are\ninteresting and worthy of further consideration.\nBut Strevens\u2019 discussion is rather disappointing: Several formal con-\nclusions are only established informally, leaving uncertainty whether they\nare true. What is more is that there are several different derivations of\nthe Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which depend on different assumptions\n(Uffink [2006], Sections 3 and 4; Uhlenbeck and Ford [1963]). Strevens nei-\nther states which of these sets of assumptions he wants to derive nor does he\ndirectly derive the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. And the exact assump-\ntions needed for the known derivations of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-\ntion seem different from the ones Strevens obtains.\nFurthermore, his comments about other approaches in statistical physics\n6\nare sometimes erroneous. Let me give two examples. First, Strevens claims\nthat \u2018the ergodic approach looks for a more extreme form of independence\nthan I do\u2019 (p. 316). It is unclear what \u2018the ergodic approach\u2019 is because\nthere are many different approaches to statistical physics employing ergodic\ntheory. Strevens seems to think that \u2018the ergodic approach\u2019 requires sys-\ntems to be Bernoulli systems, whilst he only requires that the evolution can\nbe viewed as an irreducible and aperiodic Markov process. The discussion\nis quite informal; but if he really regarded the evolution as a discrete-time\nor continuous-time finite-state irreducible and aperiodic Markov process, this\nwould actually imply that the system is Bernoulli (Ornstein and Weiss [1991],\np. 22; Werndl [2009b]). Furthermore, several ergodic approaches impose con-\nditions on the dynamics which are weaker than being Bernoulli, for instance,\nthat the systems are ergodic or nearly ergodic (Frigg [2008], Sections 3.2.4\nand 3.3.3; Uffink [2006], Sections 3\u20136). Ergodicity does not even imply any\nsensitivity to initial conditions. All this leads one to strongly doubt that his\napproach requires less independence than \u2018the ergodic approach\u2019.\nSecond, Strevens claims that ergodic theory is unsuitable for treating\ncomplex systems because even the most general theorems in ergodic theory\nassume that the energy is conserved and that the evolution function is contin-\nuous (pp. 26\u201327). This is not so: Ergodic theory has been applied to several\nsystems which do not conserve energy, e.g. the Lorenz system, and to many\nnon-continuous evolution functions, e.g. the baker\u2019s transformation (Ornstein\nand Weiss [1991]). Generally, many ergodic theorems only require a measur-\nable evolution function, including functions which are nowhere continuous,\ne.g. the Dirichlet function (Berger [2001], Chapter 3).\nBy appealing to EPA, Strevens suggests some interesting possible ex-\nplanations of the simple behaviour in population ecology and in the social\nsciences. But there are no concrete models, and he admits that not enough\nis known to really say whether EPA applies (pp. 327, p. 355). So in the end\nwe can conclude only that still a lot of work is needed to explain the simple\nbehaviour of complex systems; exciting work for the future!\nDespite these problems, the book will be valuable because of its good intro-\nduction to the MAF, its new results concerning the MAF, and its stimulating\nideas about how to explain the simple behaviour of complex systems.\n7\nAcknowledgements\nMost thanks should go to Jeremy Butterfield for many valuable suggestions.\nI am also grateful to Franz Huber, Roman Frigg, and Michael Strevens for\nhelpful discussions and comments.\nReferences\nBerger, A.
