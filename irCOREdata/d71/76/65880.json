The Anopheles mosquitoes that act as vectors for\nhuman Plasmodium parasites must access sugar, blood, and\naquatic oviposition sites to complete their life cycle and\nmaintain parasite transmission. The availability of such\necological resources to mosquitoes has long been recognized\nas a crucial determinant of malaria transmission [3], but\nquantitative understanding of this process, as well as viable\nmeans to prevent it, remain poorly developed compared with\nother disease [4] and pest systems [5]. Recent theoretical work\nhighlights the enormous influence of blood source and\naquatic habitat availability in determining malaria trans-\nmission intensity, disease burden, and their responsiveness to\nvarious forms of control [6\u201312]. Here we apply field-para-\nmeterized kinetic models of mosquito host availability [11,13]\nto identify important shortcomings of current global targets\nfor delivering insecticide treated nets (ITNs) [2,14,15], the\nmost important vector control tool in Africa today. Not only\ndoes the model outline the limitations of existing strategies\nthat emphasize targeting of vulnerable groups such as young\nchildren and pregnant women [16\u201318], it also indicates how\ncomplementary strategies to promote coverage of whole\npopulations, including nonvulnerable adults and older\nchildren [19], will achieve greater and more equitable\nreduction of disease burden than otherwise would be\npossible.\nInsecticide-treated nets (ITNs) represent a practical and\neffective means to prevent malaria in Africa [20], so scaling\nup coverage to at least 80% use by young children and\npregnant women by 2010 is a consensus target of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Roll Back\nMalaria Partnership, and the US President\u2019s Malaria Initiative\n[2,14,15]. Targeting individual protection to these vulnerable\ngroups [16\u201318] is a well-founded and explicitly accepted\npriority of all three initiatives, because these groups bear the\nhighest risk of morbidity and mortality from malaria.\nHowever, this strategy largely ignores the potentially greater\ncommunity-wide benefits of broader population coverage\n[19], and no explicit resources, targets, or strategies have been\nproposed to achieve these benefits.\nITNs can protect not only the individuals and households\nthat use them, but also members of the surrounding\ncommunity [19,21\u201326]. This is because they kill adult\nmosquitoes directly or force them to undertake longer, more\nhazardous foraging expeditions in search of vertebrate blood\nand aquatic habits [11]. Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria\nparasite responsible for the bulk of deaths in Africa, requires\nat least 8 d to develop from imbibed gametocytes into mature\nsporozoites within the salivary glands of the vector mosquito.\nThis means that most malaria transmission is carried out by\nmosquitoes that are at least 10 d old and have taken several\nprevious blood meals at intervals of 2\u20135 d [27,28]. By even\nmodestly increasing mosquito mortality while they attempt to\nfeed on humans, ITNs can greatly reduce the number of\nmosquitoes that survive repeated hazardous encounters with\nprotected humans [11]. Also, the excito-repellent properties\nof ITNs can reduce the frequency with which mosquitoes\nsuccessfully acquire blood, often diverting them to feed on\nother mammals that do not host the malaria parasite,\nresulting in greatly reduced prevalence of sporozoite in-\nfection [11]. This theoretical rationale is strongly supported\nby detailed observations from experimental hut studies [29\u2013\n34] and from larger village-scale trials: ITNs have been clearly\nshown to reduce malaria risk among unprotected individuals\nby suppressing the density [35\u201337], survival [35\u201337], human\nblood indices [38,39], and feeding frequency [39] of malaria\nvector populations.\nLarge reductions of transmission are required to appreci-\nably reduce malaria burden in most of Africa [17,40],\nparticularly in the longer term as exposure and immunity\nre-equilibrate [41]. ITNs can address this challenging need\nthrough direct personal protection and area-wide suppres-\nsion of the malaria transmission intensity that benefits even\nnonusers. It has been suggested that such communal benefits\ncan make large impacts on disease burden only if appreciable\nlevels of coverage are achieved in the human population as a\nwhole [11,12,19], but precise coverage targets for achieving\nthis remain to be determined. So how much coverage is\nenough to protect individuals who do not use an ITN?\nMethods\nOverview\nHere we used recently developed kinetic models of\nmosquito behaviour and mortality [11,13] to answer this\nquestion by considering the impact of ITNs on human host\navailability and feeding hazards to mosquitoes, as well as the\nconsequences of such changes for malaria transmission\nintensity. Protection was estimated in terms of protection\nagainst exposure to infectious mosquito bites, expressed as\nthe relative change in the entomological inoculation rate\n(EIR). EIR is a proven epidemiological indicator of malaria\ntransmission intensity and a key determinant of disease\nburden [17,40].\nTwo common but ecologically distinct African malaria\ntransmission systems are considered. First, we modelled an\nAnopheles gambiae Giles or An. arabienis Patton (sibling species\nfrom the same species complex known as An. gambiae sensu\nlato) population with access to human blood only. Second, we\nconsidered An. arabiensis populations in the presence of\nabundant cattle, which can act as alternative blood sources.\nAn. gambiae greatly prefers humans, but An. arabiensis will\nreadily feed upon cattle [42,43], so populations of these\nspecies respond quite differently to increasing ITN coverage,\nwith malaria transmission by the latter typically being lower\nto begin with but less sensitive to control with ITNs [11].\nIn both transmission systems we considered ITNs with\nproperties typical of those evaluated in rigorous clinical trials\n[20] or those of emerging technologies with improved\noperational durability [44\u201347]. Note that coverage is ex-\npressed as the proportion of the total human population\nusing an ITN each night, rather than in terms of ownership,\nbecause this value is the most direct indicator of both\npersonal and communal protection.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of how mosquito behaviour\nand survival were modelled as a function of host availability,\nITN properties, compliance, and coverage. The approach\ndescribed is essentially a behaviourally explicit extension of\nexisting vector biodemography [48] models, which predict\nepidemiologically relevant outcomes such as exposure to\ntransmission (the biodemography\u2013epidemiology model). The\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291247\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\nFigure 1. A Schematic Outline of the Two-Tier Model Used for This Analysis, Adapted from Previous Detailed Descriptions\nA detailed model of mosquito behaviour and survival as a function of host availability, ITN properties, compliance, and coverage [11,13] was used to\nestimate the key biodemographic parameters that determine malaria transmission intensity (behaviour\u2013biodemography model). This model allowed\nthe influence of ITN usage upon malaria transmission intensity to be estimated (biodemography\u2013epidemiology model) in terms of EIR experienced by\nboth users and nonusers [11,27,50]. All terms and symbols are defined in detail elsewhere [11,27,50,52] and are summarized in Methods.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040229.g001\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291248\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\nprinciples and utility of the biodemography\u2013epidemiology\nmodels we have used [27,49,50], as well as several others that\nare based on similar assumptions [6,18,28,51], are well\nestablished. Notably, this family of models realistically\nassumes that mosquito behaviour cycles between host\nseeking, feeding, resting, oviposition-site seeking, oviposition,\nand back to host seeking again [51]. Similarly to recent\nanalyses of the importance of oviposition [7,8,10] and host\nacquisition [11,12] processes, here we explicitly modelled the\nunderlying behavioural events that determine the input\nparameters of these biodemographic processes (the behav-\niour\u2013biodemography model). Detailed consideration of mos-\nquito behaviour and mortality upon encounter with\nindividual hosts (the individual-level submodel) allows simu-\nlation of the impact of ITNs upon the foraging requirements\nand risks for mosquito populations at the community level\n(the community-level submodel). This hierarchical approach\nlinks individual- and community-level submodels into an\nintegrated behaviour\u2013biodemography model, which drives\nthe outcome of the biodemography\u2013epidemiology model and\nallows the influence of ITNs upon malaria transmission\nintensity to be estimated in terms of EIR experienced by both\nusers and nonusers [11,27,50].\nThe specific modelling approach described here is almost\nidentical to our recent exploration of the optimal properties\nof ITNs as a function of local ecology [11], apart from subtle\nimprovements in terms calculating mosquito diversion,\nmortality, and feeding probabilities per host encounter. It is\nalso similar to and consistent with the approaches of others\n[6,12] but accounts for the fact that ITNs can act only during\ntimes of the night when they are actually in use, so that their\noverall protection is also influenced by subtle variations in\nthe behavioural interactions between humans and mosqui-\ntoes [13]. This model has already been evaluated through\nimproved iterations in terms of sensitivity to variations in the\nassumed parameter values for the insecticidal and excito-\nrepellent properties of ITNs [11], the survival rate of\nmosquitoes while foraging for resources [11], the innate\nresource preferences of vector populations [11,50,52], and the\navailability of those resources, including oviposition sites [50]\nand alternative blood meal hosts [11,50].\nWhile the analysis outlined here could be implemented\nwith either of the recently developed (and perhaps more\nelegant) alternative models [6,12], this particular form\ncaptures all of the same processes without necessitating the\nmathematical subtleties of integration, differentiation, equi-\nlibrium analysis, or limits. While these are inherently valuable\ntools for mathematical modelling, they often constitute\n\u2018\u2018black boxes\u2019\u2019 to nonmathematicians, including several\nauthors of this article. We therefore chose a model that does\nnot require mathematical complexities that might limit\naccessibility to some of the field biologists and epidemiolo-\ngists for whom this analysis is most relevant. The model is\npresented as a downloadable spreadsheet (see Protocol S1)\nand has proven valuable for teaching the ecological basis of\nmalaria epidemiology and control to students in both the\ndeveloped and developing world.\nModelling Mosquito Behaviour and Mortality at the\nIndividual Level\nHere we describe a submodel of behavioural and mortality\nprocesses that occur at the level of individual mosquitoes\nseeking, encountering, attacking, and feeding upon individ-\nual blood hosts. Another important simplification to consider\nis that, like most deterministic malaria transmission models,\nour approach assumed a \u2018\u2018malaria in a bottle\u2019\u2019 scenario in\nwhich populations of identical parasites, vectors, and hosts\nare mixed homogenously within an enclosed system [53]. One\nimportant corollary of this assumption is that well-estab-\nlished variations of vulnerability to malaria infection within\nhuman populations [16,17] or associated variations in\nattractiveness and availability to mosquitoes [9,54\u201356] are\nnot explicitly modelled.\nAs defined previously [52], the availability (a) of any host (j)\nof any species (s) is the product of the rate at which individual\nvectors encounter it (es, j) and the probability that, once\nencountered, they will feed upon it (\/s, j):\nas; j \u00bc es; j\/s; j: \u00f01\u00de\nNote that this kinetic definition of availability as a rate per\nunit time is consistent with applications of the same term to\nacquisition of oviposition sites [10], the term attraction rate for\nblood sources [6,57], and the terms feeding rate and oviposition\nrate for both resources [8,12].\nWe considered successful feeding as just one of three\npossible outcomes of a host encounter by a female vector, the\nother two being death while attempting to feed and diversion\nto seek another host (Figure 1). We considered this a two-\nstage process in which the vector first either attacks the\nencountered host or is diverted away and searches for\nanother, the probabilities of which we denote as c and D,\nrespectively. This definition of diversion includes the\ncombined effects of noncontact repellency and contact-\nmediated irritancy, often referred to as excito-repellency\n[58,59]. Considering mean values for hosts of any given\nspecies (s), the sum of these two probabilities is:\ncs \u00fe Ds \u00bc 1: \u00f02\u00de\nWe then considered the second stage of the blood\nacquisition process, namely feeding.

We adapted Equation 3 from our previous\nformulation [50] to estimate the survival rate per feeding\ncycle (Pf) as the product of the probability of surviving the\neventual attack on a host that may be protected (Pc) and the\nprobabilities of surviving the gestation (g), oviposition site-\nseeking (go), and vertebrate host-seeking (gv) intervals, with\ndistinct daily survival probabilities for the resting (P),\nforaging for either oviposition sites or vertebrate hosts (Pov),\nand attacking (Pc) phases:\nPf \u00bc PgPgo\u00fegvov Pc: \u00f012\u00de\nThe mean probability of mosquitoes surviving their\neventual chosen host attack (Pc) was calculated assuming that\nthe proportion of all attacks that end in death is the sum of\nthe mortality probabilities for attacking protected and\nunprotected hosts, weighted according to the proportion of\nall encounters that will occur on such hosts. Assuming that\nprotection does not affect encounter rates, and that these\nrates are proportional to availability when unprotected, we\napplied this weighting approach to estimate total attack-\nrelated mortality rate and consequent survival as follows:\nPc \u00bc 1\u0002\nlu\u00fepah;uNh;p \u00fe lu\u00f0acNc \u00fe ah;uNh;u\u00de\nah;u\u00f0Nh;u \u00fe Nh;p\u00de \u00fe acNc : \u00f013\u00de\nSimilarly, the human blood index is calculated as the\nproportion of total host availability accounted for by humans\n[52], similarly to Equation 9:\nQh \u00bc\nAh;u \u00fe Ah;p\nAh;u \u00fe Ah;p \u00fe Ac : \u00f014\u00de\nThe EIR for protected and unprotected individuals was\nthen calculated from the total number of infectious bites\nupon humans that occur in the population as a whole (b E)\n[27,49], the share of the total human availability represented\nby that group, and the population size of that group:\nEIRh;u \u00bc bEAh;uAhNh;u \u00f015\u00de\nEIRh;p \u00bc\nbEAh;p\nAhNh;p\n; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere b is the mean number of infectious human bites each\nemerging mosquito takes in its lifetime and E is the\nemergence rate of mosquitoes [27].

Namwawala, in the\nKilombero Valley, southern Tanzania is the primary centre\nfor parameterising our model because of the exceptionally\ndetailed quantitative characterisation of malaria transmission\nand vector biodemography in this village and the surround-\ning area. This is a holoendemic village with intense seasonal\ntransmission, stable high parasite prevalence in humans, and\na heavy burden of clinical malaria [61\u201368]. At this site the\nbulk of transmission is mediated by An. gambiae sensu lato (of\nwhich the main species involved in transmission is An.\narabiensis) and transmission intensity has been modelled with\navailable field data [27,49].\nAs previously described [27,49], we based our estimate of\nhuman population size [62] approximately upon those\nreported for this particular village during the early 1990s.\nNevertheless, we used a human population size of 1,000 and,\nwhere relevant, a bovine population of the same size so that\nthe EIR experienced by users and nonusers could be easily\ncalculated at net coverage levels approaching 0% and 100%.\nBy setting coverage to 0.001 or 0.999, this model simulates a\nsingle user or nonuser in the population, respectively.\nInfectiousness of humans (j) is set to 0.030, reflecting a\nmore precise recent estimate [69] than was available\npreviously [61,63]. In a typical holoendemic scenario, the\ninfectiousness of the human population is thought to be\nlargely insensitive to reductions in transmission intensity [69].\nIn the interests of making conservative and generalizable\npredictions, we assumed that increasing coverage with ITNs\nwill not affect j [69], even though reduction of j is likely at\nEIR values below 10 infectious bites per person per year [56].\nWe set mean daily survival of the resting phase (P) at 0.90,\nreflecting a median value of daily survival at four well-\ncharacterised holoendemic sites [27] and estimated daily\nindoor survival for An. gambiae s.l. in Tanzania [70]. As\npreviously described, the daily survival rate of mosquitoes\nwhile foraging for blood or oviposition sites (Pov) was set at\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291251\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\n0.80, representing a median value of plausible field values\n[11]. The results of experimental hut studies [34] were\ncombined with host-choice evaluations [71] and appropriate\nanalytical models [50,52] to define the attack and mortality\nprobabilities of An. arabiensis encountering cattle or humans:\nwe set the probability that An. arabiensis will attack unpro-\ntected cattle or humans (cu), conditional upon encountering\nthem, to be 0.90 and the chance that they will die in the\nattempt (lu) at 0.10.\nUsing these parameters and Equation 3, we calculated that,\nfor An. arabiensis, the overall feeding probability upon either\ncattle (\/c) or unprotected humans (\/h,u) would be 0.81, a value\nsimilar to previous estimates of approximately 0.80\u20130.85 for\nthe feeding success of An. gambiae sensu lato on sleeping\nhumans in Tanzania [34,62]. We also applied these same\nprobabilities of attacking (cu), feeding (\/h,u), and dying (lu) to\nAn. gambiae sensu stricto encountering unprotected humans.\nThe availabilities of unprotected humans and cattle were\ncalculated for An. arabiensis using field measurements of the\nduration of the feeding cycle and were extended to An.\ngambiae s.s., accounting for the lower estimated relative\navailability of cattle (kc) to this mosquito species as previously\ndescribed [52]. Note that kc is assumed to modify ac by\naffecting the encounter rate only, indicating that these\nmosquitoes can differentiate between preferred and non-\npreferred hosts at long ranges [72\u201374]. In the case of An.\narabiensis this assumption is consistent with the longer spatial\nrange of attraction of cows relative to humans for zoophilic\nmembers of the An. gambiae complex [72\u201374].\nParameters Reflecting the Effects of Insecticide-Treated\nBed Nets\nThe parameter definitions and values describing the\nimpacts of ITNs on vector behaviour and mortality at the\nlevel of individual interactions are listed in Table 1. The\nimpacts of ITNs very much depend on their excito-repellent\nand insecticidal properties, which are most representatively\nevaluated using well-established experimental hut method-\nologies [59,75,76] that have been extensively applied to this\nparticular intervention [29\u201334]. Furthermore, the interaction\nof these two properties, to yield varying levels of personal and\ncommunal protection, is complex and has crucial implica-\ntions for ITN programmes across Africa [11]. Sensitivity\nanalysis of models similar to those used in this paper [11] have\npreviously been used to explore the influence that these\nproperties might have upon the magnitude and equity of\nprotection afforded by ITNs (Figure 2). In order to validate\nthis slightly revised model (see Equations 4\u20138) and similarly\ninvestigate such interactions at ITN coverage levels that can\nbe plausibly sustained, we examined usage data collected\nduring routine socioeconomic status surveys of a long-\nstanding demographic surveillance system in the Kilombero\nValley, southern Tanzania, where social marketing pro-\ngrammes have been well established since 1997 [77,78]. Data\nfrom the annual ITN usage survey in 2004 were used because\nthey overlap with detailed entomological surveys of malaria\ntransmission (which will be reported elsewhere). These\nsurveys of randomly sampled residents from across two rural\ndistricts indicate that 75% (11,982\/16,086) net use was\nachieved although most of these nets were not effectively\ntreated [79]. In this sensitivity analysis, we assumed that new\nlong-lasting ITN technologies [44\u201347] will enable sustained\ncoverage with nets that are effectively treated even under the\nmost rigorous programmatic field conditions.\nFigure 2 shows that, for the comparatively zoophilic vector\nAn. arabiensis, in the presence of alternative hosts, excito-\nrepellency consistently enhances the benefits for both users\nand nonusers, regardless of the insecticidal properties of the\nnet. Consistent with previous analyses using this model [11],\nthis simulation suggests that nets that are purely excito-\nrepellent and lack insecticidal properties could slightly\nincrease exposure of nonusers to An. gambiae sensu lato by\ndiverting mosquitoes to them where no alternative sources of\nblood are available. Thus, purely diversionary vector control\nstrategies may indeed be ethically questionable, as was\npreviously suggested [31,34,80,81]. Nevertheless, even modest\ninsecticidal properties are expected to counterbalance this\ninequity and confer a useful communal reduction of EIR.\nWhile repellent properties do slightly reduce the benefits to\nFigure 2. The Simulated Protection ITNs Afford against Exposure to\nMalaria Transmission as a Function of Their Ability to Divert and Kill Host-\nSeeking Mosquitoes\nProtection is expressed as relative exposure to malaria transmission\n(EIRC\/EIRo) for individuals with (Equation 19) and without (Equation 18)\nnets is plotted as a function of their ability to divert (Dp) and kill (lp)\nmosquitoes attacking protected humans. To simulate the likely field\nproperties of existing long-lasting insecticidal nets with a full range of\ninsecticidal and excito-repellent properties, the parameters of this model\nreflecting increased mosquito mortality (lp) and diversion (Dp) were\nvaried across a plausible range of 0\u20130.8. As described in the main text\nand previous publications, these results represent simulations in two\ndistinctive scenarios: An. gambiae sensu lato in the absence of cattle\n(results for both sibling species are identical) and An. arabiensis in the\npresence of one head of cattle per person. The biodemographic\nparameters of the interacting vector and parasite are also exactly as\ndescribed previously [11,13] with survival of foraging mosquitoes (Pov)\nset at 0.8 per day. Coverage levels of 75% net usage was assumed,\nconsistent with the results of surveys in the Kilombero Valley, southern\nTanzania (see Methods: Parameters Reflecting the Effects of Insecticide-\nTreated Bed Nets).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040229.g002\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291252\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\nnonusers exposed to anthropophagic vectors lacking an\nalternative host, this slight disadvantage is likely to be\noutweighed in practice by the advantage of improved\npersonal protection for users: Excito-repellent properties\nand physical barriers add to the effectiveness of insecticides\nfor personal protection because these two incentives con-\nstitute the major motivating force behind ITN uptake and use\nat the individual and subsequently the community level. It is\nalso reassuring to note that the predictions and epidemio-\nlogical implications of this slightly revised model are very\nsimilar to those reported for its previous iteration [11].\nWe therefore concluded that the simulations described in\nthe main text should consider ITNs with both insecticidal and\nexcito-repellent properties, consistent with those of products\ncurrently on the market that have been evaluated in a variety\nof settings and experimental designs.\nTo simulate the likely properties of established ITNs under\nprogrammatic conditions, we conservatively assumed they will\nboth divert and kill 40% more mosquitoes than an unpro-\ntected human (lp\u00bc 0.4 and Dp\u00bc 0.4). A net with such proper-\nties would protect against 64% of indoor exposure (1\u0002 [(1\u0002\n0.4)3 (1\u0002 0.4)]\u00bc 0.64), as measured in a typical experimental\nhut trial [46,76]. To explore the best possible future scenario\nfor the development of highly durable ITNs [44\u201347] or regular\nretreatment services [82], we also simulated increasing co-\nverage with nets that divert and kill 80% more mosquitoes\nthan with an unprotected human (lp \u00bc 0.8 and Dp \u00bc 0.8),\nproviding 96% protection (1\u0002 [(1\u00020.8)3 (1\u00020.8)]\u00bc0.96). The\nproportion of normal biting exposure that occurs while\nnets are actually in use (pi) has been estimated as 90% for A.\ngambiae in southern Tanzania [13], so we set pi to a value of 0.90.\nResults\nFigure 3 illustrates how increasing community-level pro-\ntection of ITN nonusers and users alike combines with\nconstant individual protection to reduce exposure to malaria.\nRegardless of vector species or the availability of alternative\nhosts, modestly effective conventional ITNs achieve much\ngreater impact upon human exposure, even that of users, if\napproximately half or more of the whole human population\nis covered. While this principle has already been suggested by\nfield trials [19] and two independently formulated models\n[11,12], here we have identified specific coverage thresholds at\nwhich communal protection becomes greater than or equal\nto individual personal protection. Where alternative hosts for\nvector mosquitoes are absent, 35% of the human population\nmust sleep under regular ITNs to achieve equivalence of\npersonal and communal protection mechanisms, resulting in\nmajor community-wide suppression of exposure. The same\ntarget is achieved at 55% coverage where alternative hosts\nsuch as cattle are present.\nFigure 3. Relative Exposure to Malaria Transmission (EIRC\/EIRo) as a Function of Increasing Coverage with Insecticide-Treated Nets\nWe express coverage as the proportion of the total human population using an ITN each night, and protection as the proportional reduction of\ninfectious bites to which a resident is exposed (see Methods). Individual protection afforded to users (thin solid line; Equation 20) and communal\nprotection afforded to nonusers (thick dashed line; Equation 18), as well as their combined effect on users (thick solid line; Equation 19) are separately\ncalculated [11,13]. Two distinct but common and broadly distributed ecological scenarios in Africa are considered: (1) An. gambiae or An. arabienis\n(sibling species of the same species complex known as An. gambiae sensu lato) populations in the absence of alternative blood sources and (2) vector\npopulations dominated by An. arabiensis in the presence of abundant cattle as alternative hosts. Both scenarios are simulated with ITNs that have either\nstandard or improved properties (See Methods). Grey shading represents an approximate absolute maximum for community-level coverage achievable\nby covering vulnerable under five years of age and pregnant population groups only with perfect targeting efficiency. Arrows extrapolate the\nthresholds at which communal and personal protection are equivalent.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040229.g003\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291253\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\nThe insecticidal and excito-repellent properties of ITNs\nthat define levels of personal protection also determine the\nextent of community-wide alleviation of exposure amongst\nusers and nonusers alike [11], so improved ITN properties\nconsistently result in improved overall impact. In our model,\nslightly higher usage rates were required to achieve equiv-\nalence of individual and communal effects, with thresholds of\n40% and 64% coverage for vector populations with and\nwithout alternative hosts, respectively (Figure 3). While\nemerging ITN technologies with long-lasting insecticidal\nproperties under programmatic conditions [44] would confer\nuseful personal protection even at low coverage levels,\npersonal protection was greatly enhanced by communal\nprotection. At the 75% total population coverage recently\nachieved with largely untreated nets in southern Tanzania\n(Killeen et al., unpublished data), net users and nonusers are\npredicted to receive .98% and .90% protection, respec-\ntively, regardless of ecological scenario, if those nets were to\nbe replaced with improved long-lasting insecticidal nets. Even\nfor users of improved ITNs, this level of protection against\nAfrican vector species is impossible without the contribution\nof community-level transmission suppression, because at least\n10% of exposure occurs outdoors during times of the night\nwhen nets are not in use [13,83]. We conclude that modest\ncoverage (thresholds of approximately 35%\u201365% use, de-\npending on ecological scenario) of entire malaria-endemic\npopulations, rather than just the most vulnerable minority, is\nneeded to realize the full potential of ITNs, even with longer-\nlasting products or regular retreatment services [14,44]. This\nrange of modelled thresholds is remarkably consistent with\nthe figure of 50% suggested by large-scale field trials using\napproximately equivalent technology [19].\nDiscussion\nIn addition to the direct impacts on vector populations\nexplicitly modelled above, coverage of adults and older\nchildren is likely to have further benefits arising from\nsubtleties of mosquito resource utilization that are often\nunder-appreciated. Over 80% of human-to-mosquito trans-\nmission originates from adults and children over five years of\nage, because these groups constitute the bulk of the\npopulation and are more attractive to mosquitoes [56].\nWhere the entomological inoculation rate is fewer than ten\ninfectious bites per person per year, the distributions of\ninfectiousness [56,69], morbidity, and mortality will all shift\ninto these older age groups, necessitating protection of all\nmembers of the population. Under such conditions, ITNs\ncould suppress transmission not only through direct impacts\non mosquito mortality, host choice, and feeding frequency\n[11], but also by limiting the prevalence, density, and\ninfectiousness of malaria parasites in the human population\n[56].\nAn under-emphasized feature of communal protection is\nthe enhancement of ITN programme equity, regardless of\necological scenario or ITN effectiveness: If the majority of\npeople living in malaria-endemic Africa regularly used\nexisting ITN technologies, nonusers would receive communal\nprotection at least equivalent to using the only ITN in an\notherwise unprotected population (Figure 3). This means that\nall children would equitably receive communal protection at\nleast equivalent to the personal protection of an ITN, with\nusers receiving multiplicative combined effects on exposure\nof both personal and communal benefits. While the wisdom\nof targeting interventions to protect at-risk individuals is\nbased on solid scientific grounds [9,18,84] and is widely\naccepted [16], this approach should not preclude efforts to\nmaximize communal protection through less selective deliv-\nery mechanisms. Targeting limited subsidies to maximize\npersonal protection of the most vulnerable should remain a\npriority, but more equitable and effective suppression of risk\nfor entire populations, including vulnerable groups, can be\nattained with quite modest coverage across all ages. Most field\nevaluations of ITNs have been conducted at reasonably high\ncoverage levels [19], and all five mortality trials [21,85\u201388] that\nestimated that ITNs save 5.5 lives for every 1,000 children\nprotected [20] covered large portions of entire communities\nrather than only the children themselves.\nThe choice of ITN delivery strategy has proven contentious\nin recent years [89,90], but proponents of both market-based\nand public-sector approaches equally emphasize targeting\nstrategies [9,16,84] to enhance equity and minimize leakage of\nsubsidized ITNs beyond intended target groups [91\u201394].\nWhile optimal targeting of finite subsidies is highly desirable,\nthere are fundamental limitations to the impact that can be\nachieved: Even if resources were perfectly targeted, 80%\ncoverage of pregnant women and children under five years of\nage could be accomplished with less than 20% coverage of the\nwhole population, and even less of the total human host\navailability [11,56], as well as the infectious parasite reservoir\n[56,69]. Even if the ITN coverage targets of the MDGs were\nattained with flawless targeting efficiency, the substantial and\nequitable benefits of communal protection would not be\nachieved. Specifically, the target of 70% less exposure to\ntransmission [13] would not be attained by the remaining\nminority of vulnerable individuals who are not covered and\ndo not use an ITN, regardless of ecological scenario or ITN\nproperties (Figure 3). We therefore highlight an important\ncaveat to the following conclusion of the current Global\nStrategic Framework for ITN scaleup in Africa [95]: \u2018\u2018In order\nto achieve maximum public health impact, ITN coverage\nneeds to be maximized amongst those population groups that\nare most vulnerable to malaria infection and its consequen-\nces, primarily pregnant women and children under five years\nof age.\u2019\u2019\nSpecifically, we conclude that protecting the vulnerable can\nachieve maximum public health impact only if comple-\nmented by strategies that also achieve broad coverage of the\npopulation as a whole.\nIn reality, the targets for coverage of vulnerable groups will\nnot be reached without some leakage and inequity. Our\nanalysis suggests that such concerns may be less of a problem\nthan the targets themselves and may be minimized by\nextending coverage priorities to include all age groups.\nFortunately, consensus is finally emerging that a range of\napproaches to ITN deployment merit investigation, develop-\nment, and comparative evaluation at scales for which no\nprecedent yet exists [95]. Note that this analysis supports the\nimplementation of any of the diverse and rapidly emerging\ndelivery strategies as long as high coverage with long-lasting\nITNs is sustained across entire malaria-endemic populations\non national scales. Perhaps the most important remaining\nquestion is: How can such population-wide coverage levels be\naffordably and cost-effectively sustained?\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org July 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e2291254\nPreventing Childhood Malaria with ITNs\nGrowing financial support for malaria control globally\n[14,15,95] may enable fully subsidized provision to entire\npopulations [82] of the world\u2019s most impoverished, malaria-\nafflicted nations. Existing evidence, based largely on individ-\nual protection alone, indicates that ITNs are as cost-effective\nas childhood immunization [96], and future analyses should\nexplicitly consider the additional benefits of communal\nprotection. Implementing this goal may be relatively straight-\nforward for programmes that are primarily subsidized and\nimplemented through the public sector, such as recent\nsuccessful initiatives associated with vaccination campaigns\n[91]. By comparison, social marketing approaches, including\nhybrid systems that deliver public subsidies through the\nprivate sector, may require more detailed consideration,\nparticularly where cost sharing with the target population is\nsubstantial and biased toward the nonpregnant adults and\nolder children who are key to communal protection.\nAlthough social marketing approaches to ITN distribution\nface substantial challenges [93,97,98], notable success in terms\nof coverage and impact have been reported in a variety of\nsettings [94,99,100], including the KINET programme in\nKilombero Valley, southern Tanzania where ITNs have been\npromoted and subsidized since 1996 [77,78]. Much of the\nessential experience generated by KINET was later integrated\ninto the ITN promotion strategy of the National Malaria\nControl Programme of Tanzania, which supports private\nsector distribution through a voucher system that subsidizes\npurchase by vulnerable priority groups [101]. In the mean-\ntime, the preceding KINET pilot in Kilombero has achieved\n75 % net use amongst randomly sampled residents of all ages\n(Killeen et al., unpublished data). It is particularly noteworthy\nthat substantial levels of communal protection were achieved\n[102] (unpublished data) even though most of these nets were\nuntreated or poorly treated at the time of evaluation [79]\n(unpublished data). Reassuringly, the model applied here\napproximately reproduces these patterns of communal\nprotection using plausible parameter estimates for the net\nproperties, vector behaviours, and host demographics of the\narea (unpublished data). We therefore recommend that the\ncost-effectiveness of such hybrid approaches be explicitly\nevaluated in terms of the complementary respective contri-\nbutions of public-sector subsidies and cost-sharing by target\npopulations to personal and communal protection.\nWhile appropriate engagement and sensitization of ma-\nlaria-afflicted populations is essential to the success of any\nITN promotion programme, this is likely to be especially true\nwhere cost-sharing by the target population will be needed to\ncomplement limited public subsidies. Such cost-sharing\nschemes may be the only affordable means to support full\npopulation coverage where available subsidies are inad-\nequate. In such resource-limited circumstances, high levels\nof awareness, acceptance, and willingness to pay will be\nessential to enable concerted use of ITNs by adults and shared\nprotection of all children within their communities.\nOverly confident extrapolation from mathematical models\nto set operational targets for malaria control has proved to be\na grave mistake in the past [103]. A number of complications\nnot captured by this model could emerge as ITN coverage\nincreases, not least of which might be increased selection for\ninsecticide resistance [104,105]. While we urge caution in\ninterpreting the numerical results of our analysis, the\nphenomenon outlined is well established and has clear\nimplications for malaria control in Africa and beyond [19].\nIn fact, the analysis presented here provides a generalizable\nrationale that strongly supports the conclusions of the most\nrecent and meticulous evaluations of the community-level\nbenefits of ITNs: \u2018\u2018High coverage with ITNs will do more for\npublic health in Africa than previously imagined\u2019\u2019 [19].\nWe therefore suggest that further field data, analyzed with\nappropriate theoretical models and cost-effectiveness frame-\nworks, are required to verify and quantify the levels of\ncommunal protection afforded by increasing ITN use across\nAfrica. International targets [2,14,15] should be amended to\ninclude thresholds for coverage of entire populations and\nmonitored accordingly. By making life increasingly difficult\nfor mosquitoes through programmes that promote ITN use\nby the majority of their human victims, it may be possible to\nprotect the 15%\u201320% of children and pregnant women in\nAfrican communities who would not otherwise be covered\neven if existing personal protection targets of the MDGs [2],\nthe Roll Back Malaria Partnership [14], or the U.S. President\u2019s\nMalaria Initiative [15] were to be achieved.\nSupporting Information\nProtocol S1.

Malaria\u2014a parasitic disease common in tropical and\nsubtropical countries\u2014causes about a million deaths every year, mainly\namong young children and pregnant women living in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. The parasite responsible for most of these deaths is Plasmodium\nfalciparum. Like all malaria parasites, it has a complex life cycle, part of\nwhich takes place inside mosquitoes. When a malaria-carrying mosquito\nbites a person (usually at night), parasites enter the human blood stream\nand travel to the liver where they reproduce before invading red blood\ncells. Here, they multiply again before bursting out and infecting more\nred blood cells as well as causing a high fever and sometimes damaging\nthe nervous system, liver, and kidneys. When a mosquito bites someone\nwho is infected, it often picks up parasites in its blood meal (mosquitoes\nneed mammalian blood for successful reproduction), thus completing\nthe malarial transmission cycle.\nWhy Was This Study Done? One way to break this cycle and reduce\nmalarial transmission is to decrease the number of contacts between\npeople and mosquitoes by encouraging people to sleep under\ninsecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Field studies have shown that ITN use\nreduces deaths from malaria, so the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals, and the US President\u2019s\nMalaria Initiative have set a target of at least 80% use of ITNs by young\nchildren and pregnant women (the people most vulnerable to malaria)\nby 2010. But would broader population coverage with ITNs interrupt the\nmalarial transmission cycle more effectively? Might the wider use of ITNs\n(which both directly kill mosquitoes and repel them so that mosquitoes\nhave to travel farther to get the blood they need to reproduce) be a\nmore effective way to reduce local mosquito numbers and, conse-\nquently, human\u2013mosquito contacts and malarial transmission? In this\nstudy, the researchers used mathematical modeling to ask how much\ncommunity-wide coverage with ITNs is needed to protect vulnerable\nindividuals against malaria without them personally using an ITN.\nWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers developed a\nmodel for the transmission of the malaria parasite using data collected in\nTanzanian villages where malaria is common, and used it to investigate\nhow different patterns of ITN use might affect the individual protection\nof ITN users and the communal protection of nonusers. High (80%)\ncoverage targeted at young children and pregnant women (less than\n20% of the population) provided limited but valuable protection to these\nvulnerable individuals. However, the model predicted that a similar\ndegree of community-wide protection would result if 35% of the whole\npopulation slept under ITNs provided there was no nonhuman blood\nsupply for the mosquitoes. In other words, the vulnerable individuals in\nthe population received the same degree of protection from this\nintervention as they would have got from personally using an ITN. If an\nalternative blood supply for the mosquitoes (for example, cattle) was\nincluded in the model, just over half of the population needed to sleep\nunder ITNs to provide the same degree of community-wide protection as\ntargeted ITN use.\nWhat Do These Findings Mean? Although the use of ITNs by vulnerable\ngroups should remain a priority, these findings suggest that the wide-\nscale ITN use by the entire population should also be promoted. The use\nof ITNs by about half the population, predict the researchers, could\nprotect all the young children in that population, even those who did\nnot sleep under a net. As with all mathematical models, the accuracy of\nthis prediction depends on the assumptions and data incorporated into\nthe model. So before recommending community-wide use of ITNs, the\nactual level of communal protection provided by increased ITN coverage\nmust be measured by rigorously evaluating ongoing national pro-\ngrammes. If such surveillance data confirm this model\u2019s predictions, wide\ncoverage with ITNs might do more for public health in Africa than\npreviously thought, suggest the researchers, provided the financial and\nlogistical challenges associated with achieving high ITN coverage in this\npoor region of the world can be solved.\nAdditional Information.
