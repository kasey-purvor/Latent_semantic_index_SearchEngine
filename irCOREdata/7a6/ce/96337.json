The pioneering model upon which it is built, aggregating the subject specific \ncontent of a consortium of participating institutions and their repositories, is examined in \nthis article. An overview of existing subject repositories is given, along with an analysis \nof the scholarly communications landscape in economics and how the new EO subject \nrepository fits into this environment. This paper makes a case for collaboration between \ninstitutional repositories as a way of increasing Open Access (OA) access to research. \n \nKeywords: subject repositories; open access; economics, institutional repositories \n \nIntroduction \n \nSuccessful examples of subject repositories are rare, and limited to a few scientific \ndisciplines. Given the thousands of institutional repositories (IRs) that now exist \naround the world this looks iniquitous. However, while it is widely understood who \nowns IRs (mostly universities and librarians), where their content comes from \n(academics at any given university) and who set them up (librarians, often funded by \nnational initiatives), there are no such uniform answers if you ask the same questions \nof the few subject repositories (SRs) that have been established. \nSubject repositories \n \nDefinitions of \u2018subject repository\u2019 are as rare as successful subject repositories \nthemselves. The definition given in the report of JISC\u2019s Subject and Institutional \nRepositories Interactions Study is useful: \n\u2018Subject repository: This is a collection of research outputs with a common link to a \nparticular subject discipline. Subject repositories are likely to cover one broad-based \ndiscipline, with contributors from many different institutions supported by a variety of \nfunders; the repositories themselves are likely to be funded from one or more sources \nwithin the subject community.  \n \nDeposit of content is voluntary. These repositories are usually concerned with \ndissemination; for example the emergence of the arXiv repository replacing the practice \nof circulating paper preprints in the particle physics community.\u2019 (Jones et al, 5) \n \nThis definition does not cover bibliographies that only collect references to \nresearch outputs and not full text or content. However, because most repositories \ncontain both full-text content and citations, citation-only bibliographies and \nrepositories have much in common and will be examined here as appropriate. It is \nalso not uncommon to see references to a Central Repository (CR). This could include \nsubject based repositories, but also include funder repositories or collections based \naround another notion or purpose. \nArXiv, a pre-print repository for Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, \nQuantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance and Statistics looms large over the \nlandscape of existing subject based repositories, because of its penetration in its field, \nits size and its longevity. It grew organically and quickly, and is widely credited with \nbeing one of the major factors behind the burgeoning Open Access movement. ArXiv \nhas become an essential place for authors to present their work in the discipline of \nhigh energy physics, and Gentil-Beccot et al describe the benefits of those working in \nhigh\u2013energy physics in participating in Open Access: \n\u2018There is an immense advantage for individual authors, and for the discipline as a whole, \nin free and immediate circulation of ideas, resulting in a faster scientific discourse.\u2019 (10) \n \nOther notable subject repositories are BioMed Central, the Open Access \npublisher of biomedical journals, Cogprints, a cognitive sciences archive, and E-LIS \nfor library and information science. Beyond a few other examples, there are very few \nsubject repositories catering for academic disciplines. Economics has several \nexamples of subject level collections that pre-date EO. Three key examples are \nResearch Papers in Economics (RePEc), Econstor, and the Social Science Research \nNetwork (SSRN).  \nRePEc describes itself as a subject bibliography, as it does not hold any \ncontent, just references. It is very successful, and has achieved a critical mass of \nreferences that have made it a key resource for economists. It is populated with \nreferences directly from authors or research groups, and holds over 315,000 working \npapers and links to 490,000 journals articles (based on co-operation with publishers). \nIt is maintained with volunteers, and has no central \u2018home\u2019. \nEconStor contains all the content of the German National Library of \nEconomics (ZBW) catalogue, and also working papers, discussion papers and \nconference proceedings from economic research institutions in Germany as well as \nsome from the United States. It acts in a way a national subject repository for \nGermany, \nSSRN is a scholarly repository for a variety of social science disciplines, \nranging from Accounting to Economics, to Law and Political Science, etc. The \nservice allows academic papers to be uploaded directly by authors and become \navailable worldwide for free downloading. At the same time, SSRN includes articles \nand working papers from major publishers, which are available only by licence or by \npaying a fee. In addition to these services, SSRN has a function for ranking of \ninstitutions, authors and papers, which is available to registered users.  \nSSRN finances itself through fees from institutions that outsource the \ndistribution of their research papers to SSRN, subscription fees for SSRN's subject \nmatter abstracting journals, fees for professional and job announcements, conference \nfees for SSRN's Conference Management System and fees shared with publishers \nwho distribute their papers through SSRN on a pay per download basis (Jensen). \nWhile this cost structure allows SSRN to invest substantially in its infrastructure, the \nfees limit the access to SSRN services for less well-funded institutions, and thereby \naugments the existing dissemination gap between European and American \ninstitutions. Finally, there is a clear American bias in relation to its content and so the \nsharing of both European and non-English material in its data collection is limited.  \nOn this evidence, subject repositories that contain significant amounts of full \ntext articles are rare. Economics as a discipline has some laudable examples of \ncitation databases and extensive bibliographies, such as RePEc, but full text articles \nare hard to find without subscriptions to toll access journals or services such as SSRN. \nThe subject repositories that do exist do not have a close relationship with \ninstitutional repositories. Content may well be duplicated, and there are no \nrelationships where content from a SR will automatically appear in an institutional \nrepository.  \nSubject repositories offer much to the respective researcher in a field. They \noffer a window to research as it happens; the inclusion of pre-prints, before their \nformal publication makes them an indispensible to the researcher looking for the latest \nresearch trends. Also, their independence from publishing houses is also a potential \nbenefit for those wishing to see change in the mechanisms of scholarly \ncommunication. However, they are also usually patchy in coverage and depth of \ncontent, and are often reliant a subject community to sustain them \u2013 often on a \nvolunteer basis. The particular needs of different subjects primarily shape the \ncomposition of these existing subject repositories. Appreciation of the process of \nresearch dissemination within a discipline is essential to understanding where any \nexisting subject collections exist, and how viable a repository based on the \nEconomists Online model would be. \nScholarly communication in economics \n \nThe economics publishing market exhibits a number of unique peculiarities. First, the \neconomics research market is dominated by academic institutions in the United States. \nThe top-producing departments and individuals are mainly located in the United \nStates. Despite the considerable amounts of research output produced by European \nresearch institutions, their output is underrepresented in top academic journals. While \nscholars in Europe contributed approximately one quarter of the world\u2019s academic \npublications in the field, only one sixth of the world\u2019s citations refer to European \npublications (Dr\u00e8ze and Estevan 273). This under-representation, however, does not \nappear to depend primarily on the quality of the actual publications, as the top 10 \nEuropean economics departments rank high in global comparison, despite \nconsiderable disagreement about ranking methods and the relative weighting of \nranking criteria (see Kalaitzidakis et al, Coup\u00e9 and Neary et al). This suggests that \nthere are weaknesses in dissemination practices, access and visibility. Findings from \nprevious studies commissioned by the European Economics Association (EEA) have \nrevealed that there is a European market for subject-oriented information services in \nterms of both potential end users and under-exploited sources of academic content \n(Combes and Linnemer). \nSecond, the landscape of publication types is particular to economics. In \ncontrast to other disciplines, books are reputed not to carry much weight in the \ndiscipline. Peer-reviewed journal articles, which are predominantly final, archival \npublications, therefore are the most visible and well known output of researchers \n(Lubrano et al 2). A relatively small number of prestigious journals with extremely \nlow acceptance rates dominate the field. Most journal content is available \nelectronically, and a variety of citation indices track the prestige and impact of journal \noutlets and articles (Dawson and Rascoff 3). Economists experience extremely long \ntime lags (on average two to four years, and sometimes even more) from completing a \nresearch paper to its publication. Given the relatively short \u2018shelf life\u2019 of economics \ninformation, journals therefore represent the body of knowledge several years after, \nrather than at the moment of publication. This has led to a proliferation of sharing \nwork in progress, predominantly in the form of working and conference papers. For \nscholars, these papers present an important way of claiming a stake in research topics \nand receiving feedback before publication. These publications are scattered across \ndifferent online resources, for example international databases, departmental websites \nand institutional repositories. While there have been some experiments with varying \nforms and degrees of open access journal publication, progress in this area is still \nlimited (Harley et al 343). \nThird, datasets have become of growing importance in economics research \ncommunication. Economists derive or collect data predominantly from public sources, \nand in fewer cases generate the data themselves. While data-sharing is still relatively \nlimited (McCullough et al 2), some journals, such as the Canadian Journal of \nEconomics, and funding bodies now mandate the release of associated datasets. Apart \nfrom data, material from some subfields of economics appear in an increasing number \nof popular press books, newspaper editorials or economics blogs; however, these are \ntraditionally considered outside the realm of standard scholarship. Fourth, concerns \nabout the high costs of commercial publications impede access to final publications \nfor some segments of the research community, especially scholars situated in less well \nresourced institutions. \nEconomics therefore has a fertile environment for change and development in \nthe future of scholarly communication. The existing infrastructure features some \nimportant collections and organisations, but prior to the launch of Economists Online, \nthe potential for open access sharing of full text articles and data has not been \nexploited. \nEconomists Online \u2013 a new subject repository \n \nThe Economists Online service, launched in January 2010, allows access to citations \nand a large number of full text copies of economics research carried out in some of \nthe world\u2019s leading economics research institutions. In a pioneering development, \nEconomists Online also contains datasets linked to the publications that reference \nthem. EO was developed by the Network of European Economists Online (NEEO) \nproject and is now supported by the Nereus consortium.  Nereus members include \nlibraries from around the world within academic institutions carrying out significant \neconomics research. \nEO uses a model that has previously been untried, aggregating subject specific \ncontent from IRs into one subject collection. EO achieves this by harvesting metadata \nand links to economics material held in the institutional repositories of the academic \ninstitutions involved in the EO service, making them cross-searchable and accessible \nfrom a central portal. This architecture exploits OAI-PMH harvesting technology, and \nis able to draw content from a range of different repository systems.  A strength of \nthis model is that it is easily scaleable \u2013 new IRs could be added to be harvested by \nEO with relative ease. Institutions who join the Nereus consortium can have their \ncontent added quickly to EO. \nThere are currently around 24 contributing member institutions, who provide \naccess to a variety of material types:  \n\u2022 Journal articles, primarily the accepted versions (i.e. final author versions after \npeer-review) or publisher\u2019s final portable document formats (PDF) - where \npublishers allow; \n\u2022 Working papers, preferably from institutional working paper series; \n\u2022 Conference proceedings; \n\u2022 Books and book chapters, book references and the books themselves digitally \navailable, or parts thereof where publishers allow and where viable; \n\u2022 PhD theses; \n\u2022 Datasets linked to the publications that reference them. \n \nThe intuitional repositories of these institutions variable contain much more \ncontent than just economics. However, the EO harvester is able to identify via local \ninstitutional metatada only the items that are of importance to economics. By \nharvesting all of this subject-specific material into one collection, Economists Online \nprovides an interface that is deigned to service the economics research community \nspecifically \u2013 something that the broader institutional repositories cannot do as \nspecifically. To meet this opportunity, Economists Online features a number of \nfacilities requested by the research community when the portal was being developed: \n\u2022 Simple and advanced search options; \n\u2022 Facets, to refine search results; \n\u2022 Multilingual searching (Spanish, German, French, English); \n\u2022 RSS feeds; \n\u2022 Export search results (e.g. for storage in a reference manager); \n\u2022 Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) code searching; \n\u2022 Author publication lists. \n \nThe development of EO was funded by the European Commission\u2019s \neContentplus programme. Library staff in the NEEO project member institutions have \nled the development of EO, and these library staff consulted their economics faculties \nregularly for guidance, using both focus groups and surveys, to ensure that authors \nwere happy with how their work is presented in the portal and that the portal would \ninclude features that are useful to them as researchers.  \nAlongside the material harvested from the EO contributing members the portal \ncontains the contents entire RePEc economics database. This is a very significant \nbenefit for economics researchers, who can use the advanced features of the EO \ninterface to search all of RePEc\u2019s content as well and the new material that EO has \nmade open access. Material harvested by EO is also preserved. The Nereus \nconsortium has concluded a landmark agreement with the Koninklijke Bibliotheek \n(the National Library of the Netherlands) for the preservation of the content available \nvia EO. \n This model allows provides a high quality, tailored service for \neconomists in the form of the portal itself, and relies upon the submission of content \nto be managed at a institutional level. This is a clear departure from previous subject \nrepository collections, and relies upon local mechanisms for collecting information \nabout publications and research. \nA new library-led model for subject repositories \n \nWhy are librarians, and the institutional repositories that they have built and \npopulated, well placed to found a subject repository upon? \nThere are several reasons, but most salient is that the library profession has \nembraced the Open Access movement. Unfettered access to academic research is a \ngoal that university librarians have been working hard to attain. The work invested in \ndeveloping IRs in universities around the world demonstrates the power of their \nconviction in OA, and forms a stable foundation to build upon. Charles Bailey Jr, \ndescribes libraries as \n\u2026no longer simply consumers of scholarly information. A growing \nnumber of libraries have become digital publishers, primarily offering free\/open \naccess journals and institutional repositories. (21) \n \nThe role that IRs play at the institutional level is also changing, and \nrepositories are becoming authoritative sources of information about institution\u2019s \nresearch outputs. Many UK universities have used information from their IR for their \nResearch Assessment Exercise (RAE) submission and many other institutions, such as \nthe University of Southampton, use their IR as a publication database (Simpson and \nHey 5).  \nSubject repositories generally rely on submissions by individuals or bodies. \nThe EO subject repository model relies upon content in IRs, something that there is \nstrong evidence will continue to grow and develop. The OpenDOAR website has \nreported consistent growth in its database of IRs in existence over the last 5-10 years, \nand as more IRs contain more content, critical mass will develop, making IR\u2019s an \neven stronger source of information about research outputs. \nThis new model for populating a subject repository means that authors only \nneed to deposit their work in one repository for it to be visible in others, exploiting the \ninteroperability of the OAI-PMH protocol. Studies show that authors are highly \nunlikely to deposit their work in more than one place:  \n\u2018evidence reveals that when an article has been presented in one repository, the author(s) \nwill be hesitant to make it repeatedly available in a second repository. (Xia 494) \n \nAnother major benefit of a leading role for librarians in this sort of \ndevelopment is their commitment to quality metadata. As popular as the subject \nrepositories and bibliographies like ArXiv and RePEc are, one area that they lack is \nhigh quality, accurate and descriptive metadata. The importance of this information, \nespecially in the linked environment of the web, is increasingly important. Librarians \nrecognise this and have built repositories that use rich metadata schemas and the \nability to share this rich information. The metadata that EO contains originates from \nthe host IR, and is then enriched by the EO service to include information like JEL \ncodes. \nIRs are also strongly focussed on benefits for end users, and not just the \nauthors who contribute to them. In the DRIVER\u2019s Guide to European Repositories, it \nis claimed that the:  \n\u201c\u2026greatest opportunities for abundant and diverse services are where these relate to user \nneeds (such as) discipline or subject-specific portals\u201d ( Weenink et al 44) \n \nEconomists Online fundamentally relies upon IRs that provide its foundations, \nand the EO model is predicated on the success and future of repositories at an \ninstitutional level. However, where there is the risk of duplication of effort content \nbetween institutional and existing subject repositories (Harnad), SR\u2019s using the EO \nmodel can only benefit the institutional repositories that they harvest. Institutional \nrepositories hardly need any configuration to be successfully harvested into a SR in \nthis infrastructure, and continue to hold and full text items on their servers, meaning \nthat downloads will still be counted by the individual institutions. Institutions will \nreceive more traffic to the repositories because of the greater exposure their content \nwill receive by being exposed in a subject level repository like EO. Authors will also \nbe able to deposit locally , knowing that their work will then be harvested to \nappropriate collections like EO. This type of distributed deposit, rather than a \ncentralised model used by other subject repositories, utilises the enormous expertise \nbeing developed by the growing institutional repository movement in libraries and \ninstitutions around the world. \nConclusions \n \nIs this new model sustainable in the long term? To be truly sustainable, the identity of \nthe subject repository comes from the subject, not from the contributing members. No \nexisting repository can yet claim to be a complete representation of research in a \nsubject (including all types of material, from papers to datasets). A subject repository \nis defined by its content and those who supply that content, and while a SR based on \nthe EO model could survive the loss of a few contributing members, critical mass of \ncontent is essential to their success.  Subject repositories should strive to transcend the \nindividual sources of its material if they are to become relevant at an international, \nsubject level.  \nThat is not to say that the reputation for quality in such a subject repository \ndoes not rely upon authoritative sources. Ironically however, subject repositories built \non this model could turn out to be less sustainable than individual IRs, because of the \nlack of a specific body to run them. EO is the first subject repository to be managed \nby an international consortium of libraries like Nereus, and this model will now be \ntested in particularly hard economic times.  \nWhile the scope for the role of IRs is clearly established, and the case for \nindividual institutions to support them has been proven, it remains to be seen whether \nsubject repositories built on top of this stability will benefit from the same support. \nUltimately, engagement with researchers in a given field of research is key to the \nsuccess of a SR, and EO is the first international SR by expert library staff for the \nbenefit of a particular field. \nEconomists Online therefore marks an exciting moment in the history of the \nOpen Access movement. Leveraging the potential of repositories set up by libraries \nfrom around the world, it brings a unfettered access to a great deal of excellent \neconomics research to a wider audience than ever before. In the fast changing world \nof scholarly communication, SRs that harvest full text content, datasets and citations \nfrom existing IRs can play a key role in the dissemination of research. \n Acknowledgements \n \nThanks to Tobias Thiel, PhD candidate at LSE who contributed material for the overview of the \neconomics scholarly communication environment.
