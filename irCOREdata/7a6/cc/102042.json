INTRODUCTION\nStriped patterns, from convection rolls to sand ripples, are\nabundant in nature. The basic cellular pattern sets in above a\ncritical value of the external stress at a favored wavelength\nselected by the system. Close to onset, the pattern is modu-\nlated on long space and time scales, as described by varia-\ntions in its complex amplitude. In a two-dimensional isotro-\npic environment, the amplitude is usually expected to evolve\naccording to the Ginzburg-Landau equation\nAT5mA2uAu2A1~]X2 12 i]YY !2A , ~1!\nderived by Newell and Whitehead @1# and Segel @2#. How-\never, in some cases the coefficient of the cubic term is small\nat onset, so the expansion can no longer be truncated at cubic\norder and must include higher-order terms, leading to the\nequation\nAT5mA1auAu2A2uAu4A1ibA2~]X1 12 i]YY !A\u00af\n1iguAu2~]X2 12 i]YY !A1~]X2 12 i]YY !2A . ~2!\nThis equation is relevant to binary convection at small Lewis\nnumber @3,4#. In contrast to the usual equation ~1!, the am-\nplitude equation ~2! is nonvariational. The stability of roll\nsolutions in the one-dimensional version of this equation\n(]Y50) was investigated by Eckhaus and Iooss @7#.\nThe body of this paper investigates the stability to long-\nwavelength disturbances of stationary roll solutions of the\nnonvariational amplitude equation ~2!, determines the sub- or\nsupercriticality of the bifurcations, and illustrates the behav-\nior with numerical simulations.\nII. PHASE INSTABILITIES\nThe leading-order amplitude equation for rolls u(x ,y ,t)\n5A(X ,Y ,T)eix1c.c. in a homogeneous, isotropic two-\ndimensional environment in the case where the coefficient of\nthe cubic term is small at onset is Eq. ~2! above. The param-\neters m, a, b, and g are real constants. The equation is equi-\nvariant under x reflection (X!2X ,A!A\u00af ) and y reflection\n(Y!2Y ). Isotropy of the environment requires that the de-\nrivatives occur in combinations of (]X2 12 i]YY)A @5,6#. This\nlast point is made clear by expressing rolls at an angle u,\nu5Aueix sin u1iy cos u1c.c., ~3!PRE 581063-651X\/98\/58~6!\/7315~4!\/$15.00in terms of the original roll solution giving\nu5Aueix~sin u21 !1iy cos ueix1c.c. ~4!\nSince the environment is isotropic, neither Au nor the ampli-\ntude equation governing its evolution can depend on u, so we\nmust have a combination of derivatives that acts on\neix(sin u21)1iy cos u to give zero. The combination ]X2 12 i(]YY\n1]XX) satisfies this requirement. However, the term 2 12 i]XX\nis higher order than the other terms and so is omitted.\nThe amplitude equation was derived in the one-\ndimensional case by Eckhaus and Iooss @7#. It contrasts with\nthe more usual form of the amplitude equation @1,2#, where\nthe coefficient of the cubic term is of unit order at onset.\nThere is no Lyapunov functional for the present amplitude\nequation and the system is nonvariational. At m50 the\ntrivial solution A50 undergoes a pattern-forming instability.\nClose to onset, the scalings are m;O(e2), A;O(e1\/2),\n]\/]X;O(e), ]\/]Y;O(e1\/2), a;O(e), b, and g;O(1),\nwith ueu!1.\nThe amplitude and wave number of stationary roll solu-\ntions A5R0eiqX, with R0 and q real constants, are related by\nO5m2q21$a1~b2g!q%R0\n22R0\n4\n. ~5!\nMaking the perturbation A5R0eiqX(11a) with uau!1 gives\naT5aR0\n2~a1 a\u00af !22R0\n4~a1 a\u00af !12iq~]X2 12 i]YY !a\n1~]X2\n1\n2 i]YY !2a1~b2g!qR0\n2~a1 a\u00af !\n1ibR0\n2~]X1\n1\n2 i]YY !a\u00af1igR0\n2~]X2\n1\n2 i]Y Y !a . ~6!\nConsidering long wavelength perturbations @]X ,]Y;O(d),\nudu!1], the amplitude perturbation (a1 a\u00af) evolves accord-\ning to\n~a1 a\u00af !T52@$a1~b2g!q%R0\n222R0\n4#~a1 a\u00af !1O~d2!.\n~7!\nSo the rolls are amplitude stable when\nR0\n2. 12 $a1~b2g!q%, ~8!\nas found by Eckhaus and Iooss @7#.\nA. Eckhaus instability\nThe phase behavior can be divided into Eckhaus and zig-\nzag parts. If the perturbation a is dependent on X and T only7315 \u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society\n7316 PRE 58R. B. HOYLEthere is an Eckhaus instability with the phase perturbation\n(a2 a\u00af) behaving according to the equation\n~a2 a\u00af !T5c1~aXX2 a\u00afXX!1c2~aXXXX2 a\u00afXXXX!1O~d6!,\n~9!\nwhere\nc1511\n@2q1~b1g!R0\n2#@2q2~b2g!R0\n2#\n@2\u0084a1~b2g!q\u0085R0224R04# , ~10!\nc25\n~12c1!2\n@2\u0084a1~b2g!q\u0085R0224R04# . ~11!\nSetting a2 a\u00af5AesT1ikX, where A is a constant, shows that\nthe Eckhaus instability occurs when\n11\n@2q1~b1g!R0\n2#@2q2~b2g!R0\n2#\n@2$a1~b2g!q%R0\n224R0\n4#\n,0, ~12!\nas found by Eckhaus and Iooss @7#.\nClose to onset, the phase equation for the Eckhaus insta-\nbility is given by\nfT5c1fXX1c2fXXXX1g~fX\n2 !X , ~13!\nwhere f5(a2 a\u00af);O(d), c1;O(d2), c2 , and g;O(1),\n]X;O(d), ]T;O(d4), and udu!1. The form of the nonlin-\near term is given by the scalings and the requirement that the\nequation should be equivariant under x reflection (X!2X ,\nf!2f) and y reflection (Y!2Y ,f!f).\nThe coefficient g of the nonlinear term can be found using\nKuramoto\u2019s method @8#. Setting f5 q\u02dcX1f\u02dc in the phase\nequation ~13! gives\nf\u02dc T5~c112gq\u02dc !f\u02dc XX1c2f\u02dc XXXX1g~f\u02dc X\n2 !X . ~14!\nHowever, this is equivalent to letting q!q1 q\u02dc , which would\ngive the coefficient of f\u02dc XX a value of c11 q\u02dc(dc1 \/dq) to\nleading order. It is then possible to identify g5 12 (dc1 \/dq).\nSubstituting the expression f5 a\u02c6(T)eikX1b\u02c6 (T)e2ikX\n1c.c. into the phase equation ~13! leads to evolution equa-\ntions for a\u02c6(T) and b\u02c6 (T). A linear analysis of the a\u02c6 equation\nshows that the Eckhaus instability sets in for c1,k2c2[ccr\nand then solving for b\u02c6 and substituting back into the a\u02c6 equa-\ntion leads to an expression\nua\u02c6u25\n~c12ccr!~c124ccr!\nk2g2 ~15!\nfor the amplitude of stationary solutions. Thus, for c2.0,\nua\u02c6u2 is positive for c12ccr,0, i.e., in the region of linear\ninstability, so the bifurcation is supercritical, whereas for\nc2,0, ua\u02c6u2 is positive for c12ccr.0 and the instability is\nsubcritical.\nIn the amplitude stable region, the coefficient c2 is nega-\ntive @Eq. ~8!#, so the instability is subcritical, whereas in the\namplitude unstable region, the coefficient c2 is positive and\nthe instability is supercritical. In the usual real Ginzburg-\nLandau equation ~1!, rolls are amplitude stable whenever\nthey exist and the Eckhaus instability is always subcritical,\nadjusting the wavelength of the pattern by creating phaseslips in the pattern, where uAu50 and the phase is undefined.\nHere the supercritical Eckhaus instability creates no defects\nas the pattern evolves towards a flat state (q50) since the\nconstant flat component of the solution grows faster than\ndefects are formed by the Eckhaus instability ~Fig. 1!. The\nEckhaus instability leads to flattening of the solution by in-\ncreasing the pattern wavelength @Fig. 1~d!#. The numerical\nintegration of Eq. ~2! shown in Fig. 1 was performed using a\npseudospectral code and periodic boundary conditions. The\ncondition ]Y50 was enforced by integrating the one-\ndimensional version of the equation.\nB. Zigzag instability\nIn the zigzag instability where the perturbation varies only\nin the Y direction, the phase perturbation evolves according\nto the equation\n~a2 a\u00af !T5$q1\n1\n2 ~b1g!R0\n2%~aYY2 a\u00afYY !\n2 14 ~aYYYY2 a\u00afYYYY !. ~16!\nInstability sets in for $q1 12 (b1g)R02%,0. In contrast to the\nusual case, the zigzag instability can occur for q.0 if (b\n1g),0 and q,2 12 (b1g)R02. In this case the mechanism\nis expected to be different from the usual one where rolls at\ntoo long a wavelength (q,0) saturate into bends that de-\ncrease the wavelength.\nThe instability boundary q52 12 (b1g)R02 is a parabola\nin (m ,q) space:\nm5\nq\n~b1g!2\n$2a~b1g!1q@41~3b2g!~b1g!#%.\n~17!\nHowever, because for given m and q there can be zero, one,\nor two corresponding values of R0\n2\n, only certain segments of\nthe parabola act as stability boundaries ~see Fig. 2!. Depend-\ning on the parameter values, the zigzag curve can interact in\nmany different ways with the neutral curve m5q2 and the\nsaddle-node curve m5q22 14 $a1(b2g)q%2, which marks\nFIG. 1.

The\nlatter two curves are drawn for various parameter values in\nFig. 3 of Eckhaus and Iooss @7#. The zigzag curve is tangen-\ntial to the saddle-node curve at q52a(b1g)\/$41(b2\n2g2)%. When @42(b2g)2#.0, a.0, and b,0, there is a\nrange of values of m, 2a2\/@42(b2g)2#,m,2a2\/@4\n1(3b2g)(b1g)# , for which roll solutions cannot be\nstable to the zigzag instability. Eckhaus and Iooss @7# found\na similar phenomenon for the Eckhaus instability and termed\nit \u2018\u2018strong rejection of patterns\u2019\u2019; here then is a \u2018\u2018strong re-\njection of patterns\u2019\u2019 by the zigzag instability. The stability\ndiagram is given in Fig. 2 for a case where there is strong\nrejection. Note also from the figure that where a roll solution\nwith q.0 is unstable to the zigzag instability ~in the second\nlightest shaded region, for example! it is possible that there is\na stable roll solution with an even greater value of q at the\nsame value of the forcing m. Thus the zigzag bending of the\nrolls, which leads to a shorter wavelength, might in fact sta-\nbilize the pattern as it does in the q,0 case where the rolls\nare at a wavelength longer than critical.\nThe nonlinear phase equation close to onset is given by\nfT5c3fYY2\n1\n4 fYYYY1hfY\n2 fYY , ~18!\nwhere c35$q1 12 (b1g)R02%. The equation is equivariant\nunder x reflection (X!2X ,f!2f). and y reflection (Y\n!2Y ,f!f). The appropriate scalings are ]T;O(d4),\n]Y;O(d), c3;O(d2), f;O(1), and h;O(1). Setting f\n5pY1f\u02dc , substituting into the phase equation ~18!, and lin-\nearizing in f\u02dc gives\nFIG. 2. Zigzag stability diagram for the case where there is\nstrong rejection of patterns by the zigzag instability, $42(b\n2g)2%.0, a.0, and b,0. The parameter values are b521.0,\ng520.5, and a51.0. The solid line is the neutral curve m5q2, the\ndotted line is the saddle-node curve, and the dashed line is the\nzigzag instability boundary. In the lightest shaded region, there is\none roll solution at each point (q ,m) and it is stable to the zigzag\ninstability. In the second lightest region, there is one solution and it\nis zigzag unstable. In the second darkest region, there are two so-\nlutions at each point and they are both unstable to the zigzag insta-\nbility. In the darkest shaded region there are two solutions and they\nare both zigzag stable. In the unshaded region there are no roll\nsolutions. Note that for the range of m between the two straight\ndotted lines, m1[2a2\/@42(b2g)2#,m,2a2\/@41(3b2g)(b\n1g)#[m2 , all roll solutions are unstable to the zigzag instability.\nThis is strong rejection of patterns.f\u02dc T5~c31p2h !f\u02dc YY2 14 f\u02dc YYYY . ~19!\nHowever, this is equivalent to tilting the roll solution slightly\nto obtain a new roll solution with wave number q1 12 p2, in\nwhich case the coefficient of f\u02dc YY would be c3\n1 12 p2(dc3 \/dq) to leading order @9#. Hence it is possible to\nidentify h5 12 (dc3 \/dq). If h.0, the nonlinear term is stabi-\nlizing, in that it makes a positive contribution to the effective\ndiffusion coefficient, so the instability is supercritical,\nwhereas if h,0 the nonlinear term is destabilizing and the\ninstability is subcritical. The coefficient h can be found ex-\nplicitly to be\nh5 12 1 14 ~b1g!\ndR0\n2\ndq ~20!\n5 12 1\n1\n4 ~b1g!R0\n2 @2q2~b2g!R0\n2#\n@2m1q22R0\n4#\n. ~21!\nFigure 3 shows a numerical integration of Eq. ~2! using a\npseudospectral code with periodic boundary conditions in\nboth directions. The initial state is a roll solution at negative\nwave number (q,0) with random noise added and is stable\nto Eckhaus and amplitude modes, but unstable to the sub-\ncritical zigzag mode. The real part of the amplitude A is\ncontoured at various times during the integration showing\nthe evolution of the subcritical zigzag instability. Disloca-\ntions are formed in the pattern during the evolution from the\ninitial unstable roll state. As can be seen from the left-hand\nside of the domain in Fig. 3~d!, the pattern evolves towards\nrolls at a smaller value of uqu. Since q is negative, this cor-\nFIG. 3.

The zigzag mode appears almost immedi-\nately at various points in the integration domain and diffuses\nalong the roll axes until the entire domain is covered. The\npattern finally develops patches of wiggles @Fig. 4~d!#. This\ncontrasts with the usual case where the wave number is\nsmaller than critical (q,0) and the pattern saturates in an\noblique mode at a larger wave number. With the parameter\nvalues of the numerical integration (a51.0, b5g522.0,\nand m50.25), there is one stable and one unstable roll solu-\ntion in the range 0,q,(11A6)\/5. The initial pattern is an\nunstable roll solution in this range, but there do exist stable\nroll patterns with higher values of q. It is possible then that\nthe patches of wiggles are stabilizing.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nThe phase instabilities of the nonvariational Ginzburg-\nLandau equation with quintic and space-dependent cubic\nterms ~2! show interesting features. The Eckhaus instability\nis subcritical where roll solutions are amplitude stable and\nsupercritical where roll solutions are amplitude unstable. The\nsupercritical Eckhaus instability is unusual and arises be-\ncause the amplitude instability causes a nonzero flat compo-\nnent of the solution to grow sufficiently fast that the Eckhaus\nmode evolves without causing phase slips.\nThe zigzag instability can occur not only for rolls with a\nlonger than critical wavelength (q,0) but also for rolls with\na wavelength shorter than critical (q.0). This seems coun-\nterintuitive since the zigzag bending mode acts to decrease\nthe wavelength. However, in this system it can happen that\nrolls at even shorter wavelength ~higher q! are stable. Fur-\nther, the zigzag instability can be subcritical, creating defects\nin the pattern, in contrast to the usual supercritical case.@1# A. C. Newell and J. A. Whitehead, J.
