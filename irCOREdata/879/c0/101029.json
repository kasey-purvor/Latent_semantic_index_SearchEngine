INTRODUCTION\nThe considerable scientific interest that has arisen in car-\nbon nanostructures since buckminsterfullerene1 and carbon\nnanotubes (CNFs)2 were identified has led to numerous in-\nvestigations into their electronic and mechanical properties\nand possible engineering applications. Catalytic chemical va-\npor deposition of hydrocarbons is now widely used for car-\nbon nanotube growth as a simple and efficient method for\ntheir production. In addition to CNTs, similar methods have\nbeen used for the synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs),\nalso known as carbon filaments since the early 1950\u2019s.3\nCNFs can be grown using catalytic decomposition of hydro-\ncarbons over transition metal particles such as iron, cobalt,\nnickel, and their alloys at temperatures ranging from 500 to\n1000 \u00b0C.4 A microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor\ndeposition (PECVD) process, used for the preparation of dia-\nmond and diamond-like carbon films, has recently been used\nfor the growth of CNTs and CNFs.5\u201310 However, in all these\nmethods reported substrate temperatures were higher than\n500 \u00b0C due to the microwave plasma heating and use of\nadditional heating source.\nThe formation of carbon nanotubes and nanofiber inter-\nconnecting networks with excellent electrical11 and thermal\nconduction12 could improve these parameters, even at low\nconcentrations, when used as conductive filling material in\ncomposite structures. The synthesis of connections between\ntwo or more different CNFs is important for the development\nof carbon nanotube-based electronic devices and conducting\nstructures.13\u201317 Branched carbon nanotubes have been syn-\nthesized using pyrolysis at temperatures of around\n1000 \u00b0C.18,19 Multijunction carbon nanotube networks have\nbeen also synthesized using pyrolysis at 1100 \u00b0C.20 Using an\nalumina template with branched channels produced by\netching,14 Y-shaped junctions of carbon nanotubes were syn-\nthesized by CVD at 650 \u00b0C. For carbon nanotubes synthe-\nsized using radio frequency PECVD (rf PECVD) at around\n650 \u00b0C, nanojunction formation was observed after the ap-\nplication of high electric field.21\nIn order to enable use of polymers and organic substrates\n(for the CNT and CNF growth) that cannot tolerate higher\nprocess temperatures, we have developed a method for cata-\nlytic CNF growth at room temperature using radio frequency\ncombined with microwave PECVD, where the substrate was\nkept at room temperature by using a purposely designed\nwater-cooled sample holder. Instead of using high tempera-\ntures s.500 \u00b0Cd to provide the correct growth environment\nfor the CNFs, we have utilized hydrocarbon plasmas to pro-\nvide the energy dynamics necessary for the dissociation of\nthe carbon and the subsequent catalytic growth on transition\nmetal particles at room temperature.\nRecently we published the evidence of carbon nanofiber\ngrowth at room temperature using rf PECVD.22 With an ad-\nditional microwave power source, used in this work, signifi-\ncant numbers of branched or welded CNFs, forming inter-\nconnecting networks, was synthesized at room temperature.\nThis method should allow the growth of CNTs and CNFs\nover relatively large areas on different substrates including\nplastics and other polymers which are extremely important\nfor potential applications such as flat panel displays23 and\nfuel cells.24 Growth of aligned carbon nanofibers on plastic\npolyimide foil substrates for flat panel display applications\nhas been reported recently.23 However, the growth tempera-\nture of 200 \u00b0C is still restricting the use of some temperature\nsensitive plastic and organic substrates that room tempera-\na)Present address: Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge,\nTrumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom.\nb)Electronic mail: S.Silva@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 96, NUMBER 6 15 SEPTEMBER 2004\n0021-8979\/2004\/96(6)\/3443\/4\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics3443\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The method we have used\nin this work uniquely demonstrates direct synthesis of\nbranched and nonbranched carbon nanofibers and their inter-\nconnecting networks at room temperature.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe CNFs were grown using a 13.56 MHz radio fre-\nquency PECVD system, supported by a 2.45 GHz micro-\nwave power supply (Fig. 1), at 100 W rf power and\n250\u2013850 W microwave power. For the given process condi-\ntions, the microwave and radio frequency plasma input\npower was kept constant during the deposition. Nickel pow-\nder (99% purity), with average particle diameter of 4\u20137 mm,\nwas used as a catalyst in the CNF growth process. Approxi-\nmately 50 mg of nickel powder was dispersed to produce a\nuniform thin layer on the top of a graphite or silicon sub-\nstrate. In order to keep the macroscopic substrate tempera-\nture s25 \u00b0Cd near constant, the substrate was placed on a\nwater-cooled sample holder and the temperature was moni-\ntored. Methane gas (99.999% purity) with a flow rate of\n70 sccm was introduced into the chamber prior to switching\non the radio frequency and microwave power supplies. Ex-\nperiments were conducted for 15 min at a process pressure\nof 12 mTorr.\nThe CNFs were characterized using a Hitachi S-4000\nfield emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a\nPhilips CM 200 transmission electron microscope (TEM)\nequipped with a Gatan Imaging Filter energy loss spectrom-\neter.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAnalysis conducted using SEM and TEM have shown\nthat the average length of the CNFs is between 0.5 and\n20 mm with diameter ranging from 10 to 100 nm with aver-\nage diameter around 50 nm [Fig. 2(a)]. Nickel catalyst par-\nticles were observed at the end of the CNFs, remote from the\nsubstrate (Fig. 2). The diameter of the CNF is similar to that\nof the attached nickel particle, which usually is heart shaped\nand completely enveloped by a layer of carbon [Fig. 2(b) and\n2(d)]. Bidirectional growth with a diamond-shaped catalyst\nparticle in the middle of a CNF was also observed. More-\nover, each nickel particle was responsible for the growth of\nsingle unidirectional or bidirectional CNF. Figure 2(c) re-\nveals the presence of disordered graphene layers parallel to\nthe surface of the heart-shaped catalyst particle, forming\n\u201cherringbone\u201d or \u201ccup-stacked\u201d structures with <0.34 nm as\nthe interplanar distance. Figure 2(d) shows an energy-filtered\nTEM (EFTEM) image formed with electrons that have\npassed through the sample and have lost a unique amount of\nenergy, which is characteristic to the Ni L edge (2p-3d tran-\nsitions, 855 eV). Hence, Fig. 2(d) shows a Ni map, revealing\nthat the particle at the tip of the CNF is indeed Ni and that Ni\ndoes not diffuse within the CNF to concentrations above the\nEFTEM detectability limit.\nThe TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 2 suggest that the\ntip growth mechanism, for carbon nanofibers grown in this\nstudy is similar to the tip growth processes described by\nBaker and Harris25,26 and used by Bower and co-workers27 to\nexplain the growth of their CNTs using microwave PECVD.\nPrior to the growth of carbon nanofibers, formation of small\ndomains of ultrafine transition metal particles occurs. These\ndomains act as nucleation seeds for the carbon nanofiber\ngrowth. The size of small domains corresponds to the diam-\neter of the CNF. After decomposition of methane on the sur-\nface of the ultrafine metal particles, carbon and hydrogen\ndissolves in the metal creating a supersaturated surface.\nNickel metal particles become supersaturated by carbon,\nwhich then precipitates at the \u201ccold-end\u201d of the catalyst par-\nticle surface to form carbon nanofiber structures. All these\nFIG. 1. A schematic of the radio frequency supported microwave PECVD\nsystem used to grow carbon nanofibers. FIG. 2.

The mechanism in-\nvolved in low temperature growth of CNF is not fully under-\nstood yet. We therefore believe the size of the nanodomains\nformed in the Ni catalyst is critical for the efficient coupling\nof the electromagnetic energy of excitation source to the par-\nticle. Although the macroscopic temperature of the substrates\nis low, enough localized energy is transferred into the cata-\nlyst particles to generate the nucleation sites and subsequent\ngrowth.\nIn addition to the well known unidirectional and bidirec-\ntional morphologies, between 10% and 20% of the CNFs\nillustrated in the present work are spontaneously branching\nor welding during growth, with the formation of Y-shaped\njunctions [Figs. 3(a)\u20133(c)]. The SEM micrograph in Figure\n3(a) shows a number of welded CNFs, some of which are\nindicated by the arrows. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show one such\nY-type junction that has been tilted through 26\u00b0, showing\nthat the CNFs are welded to form the connection. The axis of\ntilt is indicated in Fig. 3(c). Formation of carbon nanofiber\njunctions involves complex growth mechanism that is yet to\nbe fully determined. As a possible growth mechanism to ex-\nplain carbon nanotube and nanofiber junction formation a tip\nfusion was previously suggested.21,28 SEM and TEM inves-\ntigations conducted did not provide evidence that the tip fu-\nsion had occurred at any stage of the growth process. The\nelectric and magnetic field effects and localized energy trans-\nfer in the plasma could cause carbon-carbon bond breaking\nand redeposition of the carbon atom to form the junction. We\nbelieve that irradiation of the electrons and ions from the\nplasma play significant role in carbon nanotube and nanofi-\nber welding and formation of the junctions. Terrones and\nco-workers demonstrated formation of molecular junctions\nof crossed single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) using the electron\nbeam in a transmission electron microscope at specimen\ntemperatures of 800 \u00b0C.29 Welding of crossed SWCNTs us-\ning ion beam irradiation was demonstrated employing em-\npirical potential molecular dynamics.30 Authors have also\nsuggested that ion beam irradiation potentially could be used\nfor developing complicated networks of joined nanotubes.\nThey concluded that welding of carbon nanotubes is not pos-\nsible without structural defects. Defect rich structures of car-\nbon nanofibers synthesized in this work, could be very ben-\neficial for junction formation between them. Carbon\nnanotube and nanofiber junction formation in plasmas could\nbe the proof for the role ion irradiation plays. More work is\nrequired to investigate plasma electron and ion characteris-\ntics during the synthesis of branched carbon nanofibers and\nestablish the role of electron and ion irradiation.\nRaman spectroscopy was used for structural analysis of\ncarbon nanofibers synthesized using rf combined microwave\nPECVD. Raman spectra were taken under ambient condi-\ntions using a Renishaw RM 100 Raman Microscope (Fig. 4).\nThe excitation source was a 514.5 nm Ar+ laser with optical\npower at the source of 20 mW. The wave numbers of the\nmain characteristic peaks in the spectra were determined by\nLorentzian curve fitting. The Raman spectra of all forms of\ncarbon show two common features: a G peak at about\n1580 cm\u22121 and a D peak at about 1355 cm\u22121. The Raman\nspectrum of carbon nanofibers synthesized at 500 W of mi-\ncrowave power shown in Fig. 4 has a G peak position around\n1577 cm\u22121, with a shoulder at around 1611 cm\u22121. The posi-\ntion of the defect induced D peak is around 1346 cm\u22121, with\na higher intensity than the G peak sIG\/ ID=0.85d, indicating\nrelatively small size graphite clusters within the CNF struc-\nture.

Its intensity is con-\nnected to the presence of sixfold rings and represents the\nbreathing modes of sp2 atoms in the rings.31\u201333\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nCarbon nanofibers as well as branched nanofibers and\ntheir networks were produced at room temperature onto a\nvariety of substrates, over relatively large areas. We have\nachieved the synthesis of CNFs at room temperature in a\nradio frequency assisted microwave PECVD system, using\nnickel powder as a catalyst at 100 W rf power and micro-\nwave power ranging from 250 to 850 W. Room temperature\ngrowth of carbon nanofibers is of technological importance\nsince it would allow the use of low temperature substrates\nwhich are suitable for flat panel display34 and fuel cell\napplications.35 Random networks of carbon nanotubes have\nalready been used as electronic material for the fabrication\ninto thin-film transistors.36 Electronic applications of carbon\nnanotube networks will benefit with the introduction of new\ntemperature sensitive substrate materials when the method\ndescribed in this manuscript is used for the carbon nanotube\nnetworks synthesis. Growth of CNTs and CNFs on tempera-\nture sensitive substrates could now be achieved using a\nmethod described in this paper, a rf PECVD method we re-\nported earlier,22 and a dc PECVD method reported recently\nfor the growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes at tem-\nperatures as low as 120 \u00b0C.23,27 However, only the technique\ndescribed in this work demonstrates formation of Y-shaped\nCNF junctions and interconnecting networks at room tem-\nperature. This may be significant with respect to the possi-\nbility of creating interconnects for electronic devices at a\nnanometric scale and assembling new classes of materials\nfrom carbon nanofibers on temperature sensitive substrates,\nsuch as plastics, organics, and paper. The room-temperature\ncarbon nanofiber growth will allow direct nanofiber network\nsynthesis within temperature sensitive matrix materials for\nthe improvement of the electrical and thermal conductivity,\nover relatively large areas, even at very low nanofiber con-\ncentrations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nOne of the authors B.O.B. would like to thank R.
