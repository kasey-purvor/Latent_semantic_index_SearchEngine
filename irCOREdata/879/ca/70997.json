A particularly important line of study has focused upon the diverse national institutions that create geographically heterogeneous cultures of work. Yet none of these studies place questions about how global firms act as \u2018cultural entrepreneurs\u2019 at the centre of their analysis.

A particularly important line of study has focused upon the diverse \nnational institutions that create heterogeneous cultures of work and define how \nfirms are structured and operate (Gertler, 2004; Jones, 2003). Using the lens of \nwork on the \u2018varieties of capitalism\u2019 (Hall and Soskice, 2001; Whitley, 2001), \nresearch has documented the difficulties associated with transferring best \npractices between countries, institutional settings and cultures (Gertler, 2004; \nSchohenburger, 1999) and the adaptation strategies employed by TNCs when \noperating in culturally diverse overseas markets (Christopherson, 2007; Wrigley \net al., 2005).  \nYet few existing studies, with the exception of Schoenberger\u2019s seminal \nwork (1997), place \u2018corporate culture\u2019 and questions about how global firms act \nas \u2018cultural entrepreneurs\u2019 (c.f. Garud et al., 2007) at the centre of their analysis. \nThis is a significant research void considering the potential impacts of firms\u2019 on \nthe production of instability, convergence or even continued difference in \nnational business cultures and norms. This paper, therefore, uses the case of \ntransnational law firms to extend existing theoretical debates about the \ngeographies of learning and best practice (Gertler, 2001) and the \nembeddedness of production networks (Hess, 2004) by analysing the forms of \n\u2018cultural entrepreneurship\u2019 occurring in TNCs. It does this by firstly integrating \ninsights from work on corporate cultures (Trompenaars and Prud'homme, 2004) \nand the drivers and processes of change in national institutional systems \n 4\n(Crouch, 2005; Djelic, 1998; Morgan, 2001) into existing geographical \ndiscussions of cultures of work in TNCs and then by examining empirical \nmaterial detailing the way managers in transnational law firms drive change in \ninstitutionalised cultures of work in different international subsidiaries. This show \nthat the use of the fine-grained empirical study that economic geographers are \nso adept at completing offers opportunities to enhance both theoretical work on \ncorporate cultures but also the varieties of capitalism. The latter is especially \ntimely considering the failure of economic geographers to engage with the \nvarieties of capitalism debates, something Peck and Theodore (2007) have \nhighlighted recently. \nThe rest of the paper is structured into four further sections. The next \nsection explores existing approaches to cultures of work and argues that more \nunderstanding is needed of the role of TNCs as agents of change. Section three \nlooks at the challenges posed to transnational law firms by diverse legal cultures \nof work before sections four and five use empirical material to analyse the \nstrategies of partners in transnational law firms for managing and changing \ncultures of work in overseas offices. Section six provides conclusions.    \n \n \n2) Globalization and the challenge of \u2018cultures of work\u2019 \n \nAs Schoenberger (1997, 116) suggests, \u201cCorporate culture is generally viewed \nas a set of social conventions embracing behavioural norms, standards, \ncustomers, and the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 underlying social interactions within the \nfirm\u201d. \u2018Culture\u2019 emerges in organizations through the work of influential leaders \nbut also because of \u2018external\u2019 influences on the social practices, norms and \nvalues of workers. Significantly, as Schoenberger argues, firms can face a \n 5\n\u2018cultural crisis\u2019 when diverse cultures within the firm cause tensions between \ndifferent groups of workers or when competitors gain advantage because of \nadvantages accrued from their culture. It is the first scenario that is the focus of \nthis paper, and in particular how geographical heterogeneity in cultures cause \ntensions within firms. \nGertler\u2019s studies of the experiences of German manufacturers in Canada \nprovide perhaps one of the most sophisticated analyses of how geographical \ncultural heterogeneity emerges and causes management problems in global \nfirms (2004). As Gertler reveals, diversity in the institutional regimes of countries \n(employment laws, training and apprenticeship requirements, worker and trade \nunion rights in firms) produce important differences in the way workers behave, \nexpect to be treated and organize the production process. This means \neverything from shift patterns to machinery design need to be adapted if firms \nare to operate successfully outside of their home countries. Other examples of \nsuch detailed archaeologies of cultures of work include the writing of Saxenian \n(1994) and in relation to the professions MacDonald (1995).  \nHaving such detailed understandings of how diverse cultures emerge is \nan essential starting point when seeking to develop subtle analyses of the nature \nand affects of \u2018cultural management\u2019 in global firms. In particular existing \ndetailed archaeologies of cultures of work point towards the importance of \ndeveloping better understanding of two issues. First, the need for reflexivity in \nmanagement responses to cultural difference needs to be considered. Jones \n(2003) suggests that there needs to be macro- and micro-cultural tropes in \nglobal firms; a set of consistent worldwide values but also geographically-\npeculiar cultures and ways of working that reflect local norms. Echoing this idea \nChristopherson (2007) points out how managers in global retailers like Tesco \nhave to constantly reconsider the appropriateness of their business models and \n 6\nbecome cognisant of and sympathetic to the place-specific reactions of workers, \nsuppliers and consumers to home-country models. Schoenberger (1999, 211-\n212) describes how, as a result, corporate best practices are managed in most \nfirms not by making a choice between the binary positions of global roll-out \nversus host-country adaptation. Rather:  \n\u201c[t]he firm\u2019s dominant culture, created by and expressed through the activities \nand understanding of top management at headquarters, necessarily contains \nmultiple subcultures...These sub- or countercultures emerge as the people in the \ncorporate region confront their particular situation, which is likely to produce \nmany kinds of problems and opportunities that not adequately addressed by \ncentral norms and standards\u2026[the outcomes] reflect a dialectical process in \nwhich something new is produced through the encounter between the existing \nfirm (a unit of which may be implanted in a new territory) and the particular piece \nof the world in which it has been established\u201d. \n \nThe description by Schoenberger of something new points to the second issue \nthat must be considered in relation to cultures of work: if and how global firms \nengage in attempts to change existing and produce new cultures.  \nA vast literature has emerged from academics (Alvesson, 2002; Bjerke, \n1999) as well as academically-informed management consultants such as \nTrompenaars and Prud\u2019homme (2004) that suggests the corporate culture of \nglobal firms, and more precisely the ability of global firms to reproduce home-\ncountry corporate cultures overseas, is central to profitability. As Trompenaars \nand Prud\u2019homme note, \u201cMany problems within organizations are caused by \nconflicts between the different value orientations related to these different \ncultures\u2026The art of creating a viable corporate culture is not to choose a fixed \nset of value orientations but to reconcile these contrasts or dilemmas\u201d \n(Trompenaars and Prud\u2019homme\u2019s, 2004, 24). The challenges of reconciling such \n 7\ndifferences means that, for Alvesson and Willmott, management work in global \nfirms is less about establishing formal rules and structures and more about using \ndiscourses to mould the cultures of workers (table 1). As they put it,  \n\u201corganizational control is accomplished through the self-positioning of \nemployees within managerially inspired discourses about work and organization \nwith which they may become more or less identified and committed\u201d (Alvesson \nand Willmott, 2002, 620). \n [Insert table 1 here] \n \nDicken (2000) perceptively broaches this subject when he describes not just the \n\u2018placing of firms\u2019 but also the \u2018firming of places\u2019: how TNCs are both embedded \nby territorial systems but also influence the places in which they operate. Coe \nand Wrigley (2007) also set the agenda for a debate within economic geography \nabout the influences of TNCs on host countries when they describe the \n\u2018battlefield\u2019 global retailers face as they attempt to balance the need to both learn \nfrom overseas subsidiaries but also implement corporate best practices. As their \nearlier work has shown, \u201cThe task for the TNC, then, is to generate and\/or \ndiscover best practices rooted in particular places\/communities and, secondly, to \ncirculate this tacit knowledge throughout its organizational space\u201d (Wrigley et al., \n2005, 450). Similar insights have also be gained from work on US and UK \nfinancial institutions in Europe (Clark et al., 2002; W\u00f3jcik, 2006) and the affects \nof the arrival of US TNCs on the way businesses operate in Asia (Yeung, 2000).1  \n                                            \n1\n Importantly, in all of this work there is no suggestion of homogenisation; rather \ndialectical processes producing forms of hybridity are shown to be at work resulting in \ncontinued national distinctiveness but with greater points of convergence than in the \npast.  \n 8\nThere is, however, a tendency in existing literature to focus upon only the \nway institutional arrangement lead to change in the ownership and structuring of \nfirms with less attention given to how the activities of TNCs effect change in \ncultures of work and the implications of any changes. The latter is an important \nconsideration because the impacts of changes in cultures of work are equally \nsignificant as far as processes of \u2018Americanization\u2019 and convergence in \ninstitutional arrangements are concerned (Djelic, 1998). I, therefore, build on the \ninsights of existing work on corporate culture (Trompenaars and Prud\u2019homme, \n2004) and management \u2018identity work\u2019 (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002) to suggest \nthat theoretical understanding of the multiple forms of \u2018embeddedness\u2019 affecting \nTNCs (Hess, 2004) and the impacts of TNCs on host-countries can be advanced \nby considering the strategies used to deliberately change cultures and minimise \nthe adaptations firms have to make in their international subsidiaries.  \n \n \nTransnational social space and the negotiation of change in cultures of work \n \nChanges in cultures of work can themselves affect firm structures, something \nespecially significant in relation to law firms because questions about the \nAmericanization of legal services, the spread of adversarial legalism and \nresultant challenges to national professional regimes are of growing importance \n(Flood, 2007; Quack, 2007). As Morgan and Quack (2005) show, the arrival of \nUS and English law firms in Germany and their \u2018transplanting\u2019 of Anglo-\nAmerican, mega-law firm cultures did not lead to copycat strategies by German \nfirms. However, it did lead to the emergence of a German style of corporate \nmega-law firm, revolutionising the German market which had long been \ndominated by small firms and lawyers that acted primarily as civil servants. This \n 9\nmodel emerged as German lawyers responded to the threat of competition from \nUS and English firms whose lawyers had completely different cultures of work (a \npreference for large firms with teams of specialised lawyers) and importantly \ncompletely different cultures of client service (lawyers as trusted advisors to \nbusiness).  \nExploring the way TNCs open up what Morgan (2001) describes as \ntransnational social spaces to \u2018transplant\u2019 home-country cultures of work into \noverseas offices is the first step in better theorising the role of TNCs in \nprocesses of change. Global law firms, like most TNCs, employ locally trained, \neducated and \u2018acculturated\u2019 workers. Therefore, intra-firm spaces that help \nmanage cultures using tools including communities of practice, expatriates, the \nenrolment of employees on MBA programmes and the use of management \nconsultants\u2019 services are vital. Other strategies can also include selective \nrecruitment (Welch and Welch, 2006) and the mentoring of existing employees \nby individuals \u2018avowed\u2019 to the firm\u2019s culture (Covaleski et al., 1998). Direct \nmanagement work on identity is, however, perhaps the most critical part of the \nprocess of managing cultures. Surprisingly, though, there are few detailed \nempirical investigations of the nature of such management work and how it \ninteracts with the strategies Morgan (2001) describes. The rest of the paper \naims to help deal with this research lacuna \nFollowing Alvesson and Willmott (2002, 625), management work \n\u201cencompasses the more or less intentional effects of social practices upon \nprocesses of identity construction and reconstruction\u201d.  Whilst it is often \nimpossible to banish many of the institutional influences on workers that Gertler \n(2004) describes, management work can change workers\u2019 cognition, \nunderstandings and values, thus allowing cultures of work to be changed without \ncreating fundamental conflicts between different understandings of how \u2018work\u2019 is \n 10 \ndefined. As Clark and Tracey (2004) suggest, this is because geographically \nheterogeneous social structures (institutions) might condition individuals\u2019 \nbehaviours and cultures of work, but the influence of these structures gets \nreproduced over time as a result of multiple forms of agency and the strategic \nchoice abilities of actors. Clark and Tracey draw on the work of Giddens (1984) \non structuration and in particular Archer (2000) to explain this process. Archer \nidentifies the actors involved in forms of \u2018cognitive\u2019 change by distinguishing \nbetween \u2018primary\u2019 agents who reproduce social conditions and \u2018corporate\u2019 \nagents who can influence and change conditions through their actions. In the \ncontext of national business cultures and systems this means it is important to \nunderstand how primary agents (workers usually) are influenced by national \ninstitutional contexts but also transnational social spaces opened up by the \nstrategies of managers and even \u2018deviant\u2019 workers (corporate agents). The \nactions of corporate agents can lead to change in the cognitive frames and \nbehaviours of primary agents when effective strategies are used to negotiate the \nadoption of new values.  \nIt is these negotiations of new cultures of work that the rest of the paper \nexamines. Analysis below of interview data relating to transnational law firms \nshows that the discursive strategies Alvesson and Willmott (2002) outline (table \n1) are particularly important in the work of corporate agents acting as cultural \nentrepreneurs.2 Influential partners act as corporate agents and seek to change \nlawyers\u2019 values take advantage of the fact that, as Streeck and Thelen (2005, 9) \nnote, institutions and cultures are socially constructed and legitimised norms that \nare continually challenged as well as reinforced. However, as becomes clear, \nchanging cultures is a \u201cprecarious and often contested process\u2026Organizational \n                                            \n2\n The importance of discourse in changing social structures is something both Archer \n(2000) and Giddens (1984) allude to in their own work \n 11 \nmembers are not reducible to passive consumers of managerially designed and \ndesignated identities\u201d (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002, 621). Cultural \nentrepreneurship and the management work of corporate agents is, therefore \nabout producing negotiated reconciliations between what Jones (2003) calls \nmacro- (firm-wide) and micro-cultural tropes (local variations).  \n \n \n3) Transnational law firms and cultures of work \n \nTransnational law firms have gained the title of the \u2018trade warriors\u2019 and the \n\u2018forward guard\u2019 or \u2018shock troops of capitalism\u2019, thus attracting increasing \nattention for economic geographers (Beaverstock, 2004; Faulconbridge, 2007a; \nFaulconbridge and Muzio 2007, 2008; Jones, 2005, 2007) and other social \nscientists (Morgan and Quack, 2005; Silver, 2007). Significantly, as Morgan \n(2001) explains, transnational law firms don\u2019t simply adapt to host-country \ncontexts. Rather they also seeks to spread their home-country practices \nworldwide, something associated with the diffusion of an Anglo-American style \nof lawyering, initially to continental Europe and more recently to Asia \n(Economist, 1996; Faulconbridge, 2007a; Quack, 2007).  \nMore detailed reviews of the aims and strategies of transnational law \nfirms (table 2) are provided by Beaverstock (2004), Faulconbridge (2007a, \n2007b) and Jones (2007). It is, however, worth revisiting discussions of the \napproaches firms have used to establish global presence because of their \ninfluence on how cultures of work are managed. As Beaverstock et al. (1999) \ndescribe, the process of globalization in the legal industry has led to the \nemergence of two types of firm. First, firms with a direct presence facilitated by \nthe establishment of an office which is staffed by local and\/or expatriate lawyers. \n 12 \nSecond, firms with indirect presence facilitated by membership of a legal \nnetwork such as Interlex or through the establishment of a \u2018best friends\u2019 \narrangement with \u2019local\u2019 law firms in overseas jurisdictions. The indirect strategy \nis perhaps the least popular strategy today with all of the firms listed in table 2 \nrelying on direct presence. This is significant because lawyers in the overseas \noffices of the firms listed in table 2 are employed by a single transnational firm \nand, as such, should not have conflicting commitments to multiple organizations. \nIt might, therefore, be expected that they would be devoted to the values of the \nfirm they represent and, as a result, would be responsive to management work \non culture. The very nature of \u2018work\u2019 in law firms, and the importance of the local \nlawyer and client, does however make such an assumption problematic. \n[Insert table 2 here] \n \n \n\u2018Work\u2019 in the transnational law firm \n \nThere are multiple influences upon the nature of work in transnational law firms \nand these also define cultures of work; the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 by which \ninteractions between colleagues and clients are defined (Schoenberger, 1997). \nFirst, and perhaps most fundamentally, lawyers as well as law firms continue to \nbe regulated at the national scale. Extensive work on the sociology of the \nprofessions has revealed that the national or regional institutional apparatus \nregulating professional work - professional associations and professional \neducation - itself produces distinct cultures of practice (Broadbent et al., 1997; \n 13 \nMacDonald, 1995). 3 As Faulconbridge and Muzio (2007) describe, transnational \nlaw firms employing \u2018local\u2019 lawyers, therefore, encounter practitioners already \nsocialised into particular cultures of work. Table 3 identifies some of the key \nvalues of lawyers and how they differ as a result of the influence of diverse \nnational institutional backdrops. In line with existing work on labour geographies \n(Peck, 1996; Herod, 2001), this reveals the important forms of territorial and \nsocietal embeddedness that influence workers in TNCs and their cultures. \n[Insert table 3 here] \nSecond, the nature of work in transnational law firms is also defined by \nthe peculiarities of providing legal advice. Here the tension alluded to in table 3 \nbetween those seeing themselves as independent advisors and those familiar \nwith legal practice as teamwork is significant. As has been described elsewhere \nin relation to professional service firms (Alvesson, 2002; Faulconbridge and \nMuzio, 2008; Grabher, 2002), there is an increasing preponderance to the \norganization of work through \u2018temporary teams\u2019 that are formed to fulfil a client\u2019s \nrequirements and then disbanded. In transnational law firms these teams are \noften cross-border in nature and require cooperation and collaboration between \nlawyers in several jurisdictions.  \nThe main strategy transnational law firms have used to manage this \nneed for teamwork is the practice group. As worldwide groupings practice \ngroups act as an umbrella under which all lawyers with the same legal speciality \nsit. As Faulconbridge (2007a) describes, the aim of firms is to make practice \ngroups cohesive and based on a common set of values. To this end, each \n                                            \n3\n Of course, as Gertler (2001) points out, variations can also exist at the sub-national \nlevel. This is particularly significant in the USA where New York legal cultures are \ndifferent to cultures in other cities (e.g. Chicago or Los Angeles). \n 14 \npractice group often has its own unique sub-culture. For example litigators, \nperhaps unsurprisingly, often display more ruthless attitudes to work and \nperformance whereas corporate lawyers are more likely to engage in negotiation \nand debate, reflecting the norms of their legal work. Lawyers remain in the same \npractice group for long periods of time but have to work with international \ncolleagues in the same and other practice groups when temporary teams are \nformed to fulfil the requirements of a transaction. For those less acquainted with \nsuch team-based approaches a difficult adjustment is needed, both in terms of \ngetting used to teamwork itself but also in terms of the compromises needed to \naccommodate different modes of working when teams are made-up of lawyers \nfrom several countries.  \nFinally, thirdly, the nature of work in transnational law firms is also \ndefined by the client. Lawyers in transnational firms are the \u2018trusted advisors\u2019 of \nbusiness (Maister et al., 2002) increasingly fulfilling commercial rather than \nfiduciary roles (Hanlon, 1999). This means that client expectations inform \ncultures of work in two overlapping ways. First, and because of the importance \nof repeat business and the establishment of long-term relationships with large \nTNCs, a core group of often US and English firms define many of the norms of \nservice delivery. The profits generated from relationship clients and the fact that \nthese clients often use the services of all or several of the firm\u2019s offices means \ntheir expectations form the basis of firmwide cultures of work. Second, and in \ncontrast, cultures of work in transnational law firms are also influenced by a \nconstant search for new business in overseas markets. As a result, and \ncountering the affects of US and UK relationship clients, cultures of work in \noffices are also influenced by local norms of legal work and service delivery. In \norder to make, for example, German or French clients feel comfortable using an \nEnglish or US transnational firm the ability to also provide services in a local \n 15 \nmanner is essential. This means firms search for a delicate balance between \nfirmwide values and cultures of work (macro-cultural tropes) defined by \nrelationship clients and local responsiveness and integration (micro-cultural \ntropes).   \n \nRenegotiating \u2018work\u2019 \nThe renegotiation of cultures of work in transnational law firms is, therefore, a \ncomplex process defined by geographical variations in the meaning of work. The \nremainder of the paper explores the strategies of the partners involved in \nnegotiations about cultures of work and considers how their strategies allow \nsensitivity to but also manipulation of the multiple influences on the way lawyers \nbehave. This reveals the tensions that emerge between \u2018top down\u2019 management \nwork and the \u2018bottom up\u2019 influences of both powerful local lawyers and clients. \nThe compromises needed result in slow but subtle changes in how lawyers work \nin both the home-country and host-countries of transnational law firms.  I explore \nthese issues using data from interviews completed in late 2005 and early 2006 \nwith 25 partners working in transnational law firms. The aim of these interviews, \nwhich were conducted in London and New York, was to examine the various \ntypes of management work employed by English and US transnational law firms \nto deal with the challenges of diverse cultures of work. As a result, charting \nEnglish and US cultures of legal work, whilst important for identifying the values \nand norms the firm sought to reproduce, was only one of the aims of the \ninterviews. Indeed, as has been widely noted (Jones, 2003; Trompenaars and \nPrud\u2019homme, 2004), studying \u2018cultures\u2019 is an immensely difficult task and it often \nmore fruitful to examine the management work used to regulate the affects of \ndifferences in cultures than it is to study \u2018cultures\u2019 in isolation as independent \n 16 \nentities. Most importantly, then, interviews sought to reveal the experiences of \nmanaging partners and other influential players in relation to strategies for \nmanaging cultures of work and their affects in different legal jurisdictions. \nInterviews with individuals holding such influential positions were conducted in \nsix of the firms listed in table 2 (two English and four US firms) with interviews \nalso completed with partners holding non-managerial positions in three of these \nfirms. Those interviewed had experience of working and managing cultures of \nwork in the USA (for English firms), England (for US firms), Germany and Hong \nKong.  \nAll interviews with the exception of two were recorded and transcribed. \nData was used to allow a grounded theory approach to theory building to be with \nrecurrent themes and processes identified in interview data. Themes and \nprocesses were then further explored using secondary data, primarily in the form \nof reports from the legal press (e.g. The Lawyer; New York Lawyer). It is, \ntherefore, important to acknowledge that the following discussion does not claim \nto provide a comprehensive analysis of differences in cultures of work per se. \nRather, the aim is to explore the processes of management work and how these \nrespond to and are affected by the diverse cultures that exist in transnational law \nfirms.   \n \n4) Spatial heterogeneity in legal cultures of work  \nTable 4 provides two examples of how the challenges posed by \nheterogeneous cultures of work can affect firms financially and in terms of \nreputation. It also points towards the strategies used to solve these conundrums. \nAs the data shows, there is no one-way (home-country outwards), linear \n 17 \nrationality in the way changes in cultures of work are negotiated because of the \ncomplex forces defining different parts of work cultures. As a result, the work of \ninfluential partners in law firms is defined by the outcomes of the months or even \nyears of careful work designed to identify the most appropriate strategy to \nminimise cultural difference and invoke changes in culture in each office. The \nstarting point for understanding the strategies used is to consider how firms seek \nto minimise the emergence of cultural differences in the first place.  \n[Insert table 4 here] \n \n \nSelective recruitment and promotion \n \nA key strategy adopted by transnational law firms in their attempts to manage \ncultures of work is selective recruitment when opening or expanding offices \n(Morgan and Quack, 2005). This usually means either: (a) merging with a firm \nwith experience of working overseas and which is populated by lawyers who are \nsympathetic to Anglo-American practices; and\/or (b) recruiting lawyers that have \neducational or work experience in the UK or USA. Examining the latter strategy \nin detail reveals why such careful recruitment is important for firms trying to \nmanage cultures of work and develops existing understanding of this corporate \ntactic.  \nIn Clifford Chance\u2019s Tokyo office only one partner does not have a \ndegree-level qualification from outside of Japan.4 The most common qualification \nis an English or American law degree or MBA. This reflects the trend Yeung \n(2000) noted in the Asian context with managers with Western experience \n                                            \n4\n Data collected from Clifford Chance\u2019s website (www.cliffordchance.com) in September \n2007. \n 18 \ninfluencing transitions in business systems. One partner described the effect of \nsuch careful recruitment strategies in the following terms: \n\u201cAnd the lawyers that I\u2019ve dealt with a lot in Europe, it\u2019s very easy to get on with \nthem and they\u2019re probably more like minded that I\u2019m used to when working with \noverseas lawyers, I guess it\u2019s because the culture is the same\u2026I suppose we\u2019re \nparticularly careful in whom we pick and a lot of them are more international that \nthose I\u2019ve come across before, they\u2019ve come to [US firm x] because they\u2019ve \nworked in America\u201d (7, managing partner US firm London). \n \nThe hope is that selectively recruited lawyers will have had their cognitive \nframes changed by their socialising experience overseas. In effect, recruiting \nlawyers with experience of Anglo-American education is seen as a way of short-\ncircuiting and reducing the strength of institutionalised norms of work, ensuring \nindividuals are already familiar with the principles of teamwork and are aware of \nAnglo-American clients\u2019 expectations. As a result, all recruitment in transnational \nlaw firms is culturally selective. As the partner quoted above described: \n\u201cAnybody coming into the practice is seen by a lot of people\u2026And they might \ncome in for half a day and have a whole series of half hour slots and they\u2019ll see \npeople one after another\u2026And part of what they\u2019d be looking for, because they \nwould see lawyers who wouldn\u2019t necessarily be in the same practice area so it\u2019s \nnot going to be a technical examination, it\u2019s largely to see if they fit culturally\u201d \n \nIndeed, the Lawyer (2006a) noted how Clifford Chance was preparing for the \nmuch-expected deregulation of the Chinese market by targeting so-called \u2018sea \nturtles\u2019 or \u2018hai gui\u2019 \u2013 Chinese nationals who have or are currently working outside \nof China and are looking for an opportunity to return home. In the words of the \nfirm\u2019s Asian Managing Partner, this strategy is a response to the fact that \u201cWhile \nclients recognise the strengths of the domestic law firms, they\u2019ve expressed a \n 19 \nview to us that what they really look for is to have an international law firm that \nknows them far better\u201d (quoted in The Lawyer, 2006a). Meanwhile Freshfields \nBruckhaus Deringer, formed through the merger of an English and German firm, \nhas joint senior partners, one from England and one from Germany. Significantly \nthe German senior partner is based jointly in London and Frankfurt and studied \nat a German law school before going to the Wharton School of the University of \nPennsylvania.  \nBy employing lawyers with educational experience in England or the \nUSA transnational law firms do not hope to achieve the production of a home-\ncountry clone. Rather a layering process takes place with lawyers being \naccustomed and more sympathetic to US and English styles of practice. This \nmeans their cultures of work are influenced by a mix of home- and host-country \nnorms and it is easier, as one interviewee put it, \u201cto bring them up as an [firm x] \nGermany lawyer\u201d (21). Recruiting individuals with experience in England or the \nUSA also means responses to in-house training and expatriate management \nwork on identity are likely to be more positive than individuals without such \nexperience. Indeed, the response of new recruits to such management work on \nidentity often determines an individual\u2019s career trajectory. Demonstrating \ncommitment to the \u2018preferred\u2019 values and cultures of the practice-group and firm \nis often one of the promotion criteria in law firms. Those junior lawyers with \nexperience in England or the USA often find it easier to adjust to such values \nand, as a result, are often able to gain the support needed from partners \nworldwide to achieve promotion to the level of senior associate or partner.5 As \none partner described this state of affairs: \n                                            \n5\n Promotion in law firms for junior lawyers is normally granted by an all-partner vote or by \na committee of partners from throughout the firm. This means it is necessary for an \nindividual to get the support of partners both in the country they work but also overseas \n 20 \n\u201cif you want to control quality and make sure you\u2019re offering to the World a \nunique \u2018this is us\u2019 there has to be certain standards everyone adheres to.  And \nthat\u2019s attained through the partnership process.  If you don\u2019t make those \nstandards then you don\u2019t get in\u201d (1, partner, US firm in London). \n \nOf course, selective recruitment and subsequent training is not possible in all \ncases and even when implemented does not eliminate cultural difference. \nConsequently additional strategies, primarily relying on management work on \nidentity by incumbent partners are vital. \n \n \n5) Management work and the negotiation of change in identity and cultures \n \nAs Lazega (2001) describes, it is an influential cadre of senior and managing \npartners, famed for their ability to generate work and respected because of their \ntechnical skills, that are centrally involved in producing and renegotiating \ncultures of work. These individuals use their respect to gain election to senior \n\u2018managerial\u2019 positions and as corporate agents (Archer, 2000) carefully examine \nall of the influences described above on cultures of work (national institutional \ncontexts, the role and nature of teamwork and client expectations) and the way \nthese interact with and determine responses to any attempts to reproduce \nhome-country norms. They then use this knowledge to develop strategies that \nhave the potential to change the norms and values of lawyers overseas but also, \non occasions, in the home-country of the firms.  \n \n                                                                                                                      \nand most importantly in the home-country of the firm, which is often over-represented on \nsuch committees.  \n 21 \nExpatriates  \n \nAs the seminal study of Edstr\u00f6m and Galbraith (1977) highlights, expatriates can \nboth socialize local managers into the values of the firm and provide information \nto headquarters about the challenges and opportunities faced when attempting \nto align subsidiaries with worldwide strategies. Beaverstock (2004) also notes \nthat expatriates act as vectors for knowledge and the transfer of corporate best \npractices in law firms through transnational knowledge communities. Interviews \ncompleted as part of this study confirmed these suggestions. I explore the role of \nthe \u2018management intelligence\u2019 expatriates can provide other partners in the \nsection on partner negotiations below. Here I focus upon the crucial role of \nexpatriates as they actively attempt to change the understanding and outlook of \nlawyers in relation to cultures of work. This reveals further insights into how \nexpatriates form one part of a multifaceted process of discursive management of \ncultures of work  \nExpatriation strategies usually operate at the practice-group level with \nexpatriates working in the same practice group regardless of which overseas \noffice they temporarily dwell within. The aim is to create the connections and \nintegration needed to allow lawyers to work as one seamless, culturally aligned \nteam. This means expatriates reproduce the peculiar cultures of their practice \ngroup. However as Beaverstock (2002) shows, expatriates do not simply \nreproduce the cultures of the practice group in the office in which they temporary \nreside. Expatriates rarely become assimilated into the local communities they \nbecome temporary members of, instead acting as bridging agents devoted to the \nfirm\u2019s values but also cognisant of local norms. This means they play a vital role \nin management work on cultures because, as one expatriate managing partner \ncharged with establishing an overseas office commented:   \n 22 \n\u201cSo, why a middle age Brit, first of all in Germany and then in New York?...both \nthe cases of Germany and the US it was a strategic decision and we took the \nview that they were very important markets for us as an evolving global \norganization but they were not markets, for a variety of reasons including \nbusiness cultural reasons, where it would be easy for us to grow\u2026 for that \npurpose you need a lot of cultural glue or you end up having a very different \nculture of the business\u201d (21, English Managing Partner of New York Office of \nEnglish Firm).   \n \nExpatriates can help produce, then, what Covaleski et al. (1998) would call an \n\u2018avowed\u2019 lawyer. As role models and through the training they offer new recruits \nand the peer-pressure they exert of local partners who might behave in a \nmanner contrary to the principal home-country norms of the firm, expatriates can \nchange the perspectives of overseas workers. Of course, this is a delicate \nbalancing act and the aim is not to homogenise cultures of work worldwide. So \nwhen expatriates use the demands of home-country relationship clients to \nencourage lawyers to change their ways of working there are inevitable rebuttals \nfrom local lawyers who highlight the importance of also serving local clients in a \nmanner to which they are accustomed. Developing knowledge of the nature of \nsuch rebuttals and identifying ways to negotiate around them is all part of the \nrole of an expatriate. Indeed, eradicating all traces of local culture was widely \nrecognised by interviewees to be counter-productive. As the English expatriate \nmanaging partner went on to say about the socialisation process:  \n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do it and there are blatant examples of failure, but our clear \nview is that to really be an effective multi-jurisdictional organization\u2026you\u2019ve got \nto be a deeply rooted local Dutch firm, Belgium firm, Luxembourg firm or \nwherever it is.  But you\u2019ve also got to have a set of values, a set of priorities, set \nof objectives, set of shared values and strategy for the firm that binds you \n 23 \ntogether\u2026You have to have a strong homogonous culture for the firm itself, and \nthat\u2019s very often in quite subtle ways, its more about values, how you do things \nand that doesn\u2019t happen by accident you have to work at that\u201d. \n \nAs a result, the management work of expatriates\u2019 results in subtle changes in \nvalues as individuals become more committed to serving the firm and fitting with \nits norms but in their own personal way. This outcome mirrors the ideas of \nDelmestri (2006) who has shown that when workers are socialised into the \nculture of the firm by expatriates they often develop multiple identities that reflect \nboth the institutionalised norms of their place of education and training but also \nthe values of the firm. The latter often become dominant with the former \n\u2018repressed\u2019 by the individual as a display of commitment. This does not mean, \nthough, that the former disappear. Hence there is never a homogenisation \nprocess in terms of cultures of work.   \nExpatriates, as agents able to actively engage in identity work but also \ndevelop management intelligence of cultural differences, tend to be used in two \nsituations in transnational law firms. First, when \u2018cultural\u2019 challenges are \nsignificant and pose a threat to the effective operation of the firm. Second, \nduring the first years of new offices, the assumption being that more established \noffices having a number of trusted, socialised indigenous leaders. For example, \nClifford Chance has only three expatriates in its well-established thirty-four \npartner strong Paris office but six expatriates in its relatively new thirteen strong \nTokyo office.6 Meanwhile David Childs, the worldwide managing partner of \nClifford Chance, relocated to New York in 2005 to \u2018steady the ship\u2019 and drive the \nsomewhat drawn-out transition of the office into the Clifford Chance culture after \n                                            \n6\n Data collected from Clifford Chance\u2019s website (www.cliffordchance.com) in September \n2007. \n 24 \nthe firm\u2019s 2001 merger with Roger Wells (FT, 2005). In addition, in such \nsituations expatriates are also complemented by careful partner negotiations, \nthe role of which is reviewed below. \n \n   \nPartner negotiations  \n \nIn collaboration with expatriate partners, the most influential individuals in \ntransnational law firms \u2013 the senior partner, practice-group leaders, and \nmanaging partners \u2013have a central role in the management of cultures of work. \nAs part of their frequent business travel to visit overseas offices (see \nFaulconbridge and Beaverstock, 2008) and through speeches at all-partner \nconferences, memos to partners and video-conferences these individuals use \ntheir influence to further align the values and understandings of lawyers in \noverseas offices with those of \u2018the firm\u2019. Interestingly these influential individuals \nare not always from the home-country of the firm. However, only those who \ndisplay allegiance to the firm\u2019s core values usually fill senior positions.  \nIn addition to personal influence and status in the firm, various other \nresources are also used in negotiations to change the perspectives and norms \nof lawyers. The need to recruit US and English multinationals as clients provides \none example of how such resources are used by senior and managing partners. \nAll lawyers working for the firms listed in table 2 are expected to be acutely \naware of the \u2018trusted advisor\u2019 role they fulfil and, as one managing partner \ndescribed the use of clients as a resource for changing cultures: \nIt\u2019s [the way we work] defined by the client in terms of their expectations.  And \nbusinesses with the highest expectations and the most onerous requirements \ntends to be US businesses investing in Europe because they have a high level \nof expectation and a high level of sophistication in the way they use the \n 25 \nlaw\u2026And so we tend to have developed our systems around the expectations \nand requirements of US businesses\u201d (2, Managing Partner, London office of \nEnglish firm). \n \nSenior and managing partners will build, then, discursive strategies designed to \nconvince lawyers of the legitimacy of home-country \u2018firm\u2019 model by drawing on \nrelationship clients\u2019 demands. Tactics related to this include, for example, \nhighlighting the potential for competitors to steal clients who feel they are not \nreceiving the service they are accustomed to. This mirrors, then, Alvesson and \nWillmott\u2019s (2002) description of \u2018management work\u2019 based on discourses (table \n1). Influential partners\u2019 tactics define preferred identities and position \nproblematically the identity of lawyers displaying disliked cultures of work (parts \none, two and six, of table 1). Ultimately, such an approach is important because, \nas one managing partner noted: \n\u201cThe trick when you\u2019ve got scale is to try and develop a broadly similar view and \na consensus around the specifics of the strategic direction of the firm.  And it \ndoes mean an acceptance by partners of some reduction in their autonomy for \nthe sake of performing and implementing [home-country] strategy\u201d (2). \n \nThis approach and the consensus it produces is powerful because, as both \nArcher (2000) and Giddens (1984) recognise, language and discourse are \nmechanisms associated with the reproduction of social values and norms. Of \ncourse, this does not mean that partners in offices outside of the USA and \nEngland do not resist such change. As noted above, \u2018local\u2019 lawyers will engage \nin their own propaganda war to try and change perspectives about the \nappropriateness of their culture of work. Evidence of the success of this can be \nfound in the resigned comments of the managing partner quoted above who \nwent onto suggest, \u201cGerman businesses have different expectations and \n 26 \nstandards and also a different attitude and appreciation of the advice and \nservice they\u2019re being given\u2026And that\u2019s incredibly important because there are \nmany businesses in Europe that don\u2019t appreciate the American style\u201d.  \nHence we do not see the intact transfer of practices from country-to-\ncountry. Instead, compromise leads to evolutions in the perspectives of lawyers, \nnot necessarily so that they wholeheartedly accept the practices and associated \ncultures emerging from the home-country of the firm, but so that layered change \ncan occur and new, often hybrid forms of practice emerge. Therefore such \nchange is not predictable and negotiations can fail or lead to unexpected \noutcomes. This mirrors the ideas presented in table 4 and it is worth \ninvestigating in more detail one of the changes described. To do this I draw on \ninsights from interviews as well as reports in The Lawyer (1999, 2004, 2005), \nFinancial Times (2005) and the New York Law Journal (2005) to unpick the \nmanagement work associated with changes in remuneration cultures in one \ntransnational law firm.  \n \n \nRenegotiating cultures of remuneration \n \nFor one English firm, failure to recognise the norms of partners in the New York \noffice who were trenchantly wed to the \u2018eat what you kill\u2019 remuneration approach \ncaused major problems. The rollout of home-country practices resulted in the \nalienation of partners in New York who began to leave the firm as a result of \ntheir dissatisfaction. Consequently the senior and managing partners spent a \nsignificant amount of time making partners both in the home- and host-country \naware of this problem and sensitive to the impacts on the firm. In effect they \nused discursive strategies designed to change the knowledge and \n 27 \nunderstanding of partners (parts three, four, five, eight and nine of the model \ndescribed in table 1). This helped change the perspectives of lawyers in both the \nLondon and New York offices and created opportunities for change in both \nhome- and host-country cultures.  \nNegotiations with partners in New York were initially difficult. In part this \nwas probably because of the lack of intelligence from expatriates due to their \nlimited numbers in the New York office. As one partner working in New York \ncommented about this issue:  \n\u201cright now our managing partner isn\u2019t here and he\u2019s never here\u2026and it\u2019s hard to \nthink how many expats are floating around, I can only come up with one and \nhe\u2019s marginal\u201d (20, partner, New York). \nThis situation was rectified when the managing partner of the firm moved to New \nYork. As well as directly negotiating with partners, the insights he and others \nprovided into the nature of conflicts were vital for informing negotiating tactics. \nThis allowed the identification of the areas in which compromise might be \nreached and the types of changes that would satisfy partners in the overseas \noffice.  \nDiscussions with partners in the home-country (the London office) were \nfacilitated by two contextual factors which provided important resources that \nwere enrolled to help change perspective and values. First, the fact that the USA \nwas widely seen by partners in the home-country as an important market for the \nfirm to succeed in. Second, the problems caused by the arrival of a cohort of US \nfirms in the City of London using the \u2018eat what you kill\u2019 model. US firms were \npoaching star lawyers by tempting them with inflated salaries that could not be \noffered in a \u2018lockstep\u2019 model. Lawyers in London already recognised the need for \nrevisions to existing practices to address this \u2018poaching\u2019 problem. Knowledge of \nthese two issues allowed firm-leaders to build discourses promoting change by \n 28 \nfocussing on issues associated with group identity, the need for a new set of \nrules of the game, and the importance of responding to changing contexts (table \n1).  \nUltimately the senior partner and managing partner of the firm managed \nto gain agreement from partners for the introduction of a performance culture \ninto remuneration decisions, in contradiction to the fundamental culture of the \nEnglish lockstep. Of course, in a market seen as financially less important the \nresponse from partners in the home-country is likely to have been far less \nvigorous with interpretations of the challenges and suitable responses differing. \nThis means, as Gertler (2001) and Whitley (2001) have suggested that home-\ncountry feedbacks whereby negotiations change the perspectives of those \noperating in the incumbent regime are likely to be the exception rather than the \nrule. Nevertheless, in each case outcomes are dependent on interactions \nbetween contending parties that play-out differently depending on the stakes, \nforms of cultural heterogeneity and actors involved. Two-way learning and \nchanges in home-country cultures are, therefore, always possible.  \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThere has been widespread reporting of the adaptation strategies needed to \nprevent \u2018culture clashes\u2019 in TNCs (Christopherson, 2007; Wrigley et al., 2005) \nbut, as this paper has shown, adaption is not the only strategy TNCs employ to \ndeal with geographically heterogeneous cultures. Increasingly important yet \nsomewhat understudied is the role of strategies designed to drive change in \ncultures of work so as to help minimise the affects of cultural heterogeneity on \n 29 \nTNCs\u2019. The analysis provided in this paper highlights two particularly important \nissues in relation to such cultural entrepreneurship in TNCs.  \nFirst, the value of studying the micro-level processes, strategies and \nforms of \u2018corporate\u2019 agency that lead to changes in the values and attitudes of \nworkers in TNCs is emphasised by the research presented. The insights gained \nfrom detailed empirical study of transnational law firms and their use of selective \nrecruitment, expatriates and management negotiations to change cultures help \ndevelop theorisations of the \u2018firming of places\u2019 (Dicken, 2000) and of the role of \ntransnational networks in producing dialectic relations between TNCs\u2019 \nsubsidiaries (Hess, 2004; Wrigley et al., 2004). The findings suggest that more \nattention should be paid to how, when empowered with suitable forms of \nagency, managers are able to engage in informed bargaining that skirts around \nand deals with the challenges of cultural difference. Altering the cognitive frames \nof workers (Clark and Tracey, 2004) and creating acceptance in either home- or \nhost-countries of new models of working can minimise (but not completely \nabolish) the changes needed when transferring business models between \ncountries. This is an important strategy used by TNCs to cope with the \nmanagement of corporate cultures across space and deserves further attention \nfrom economic geographers.  \nIn addition, second, the fine-grained empirical study of cultural \nentrepreneurship reported here provides new insights into the nature of changes \nin \u2018national\u2019 cultures of work driven by processes of globalization (Yeung, 2000). \nThe data examined here suggests that we should not get carried away with \ndiscussions of processes of change as evolutions are often moderate, far from \nteleological and the result of delicate negotiations between contending parties, \nthe outcomes of which cannot be predicted and might even result in failure and \nthe reactionary reinforcement of existing values. The analysis reveals, then, that \n 30 \ncultures get produced and reproduced as they move in transnational \ncommunities (Gertler, 2001; Morgan, 2001; Wrigley et al., 2005). Nevertheless, \nthe analysis in the paper does also suggest that, to use the terminology of Katz \nand Darbishire (2000), the production of converging divergences is increasingly \ncommon as a result of the work of TNCs. The data reveals that the cultures and \ninstitutionalised norms of \u2018primary agents\u2019 in firms can be fundamental altered by \nforms of management work by \u2018corporate agents\u2019 (Archer, 2000; Giddens, 1984). \nWhen considered in the context of work on the varieties of capitalism (Hall and \nSoskice, 2001), the finding, and the suggestion of micro-scale study as an \napproach for understanding if and how change might occur, could help \ngeographers rectify their lacklustre attempt to engage in debates about the way \nglobalization has produced instability in institutional regimes (Peck and \nTheodore, 2007). Future research might, then, examine how detailed empirical \nstudy can enhance existing understanding of the forms of pressure, imitation \nand influence that lead to more widespread changes that re-define not just firm-\nspecific cultures of work but also national and\/or regional norms as TNCs act as \nvectors for the spread\u2019 and reproduction of Anglo-American business practices \nin different societies. This would open-up a whole new domain of research for \neconomic geographers.  \n  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nTBC \n \n \n \n 31 \nReferences \nAlvesson, M.

Exemplary differences between national legal business systems and cultures.  \nSource: Fieldwork and Flood (1989), Hanlon (1999), Lane et al. (2002) and Morgan and Quack (2005). \n \n \nFacet business \nculture \n \nDifferences between jurisdictions \n \nExplanations and examples \n \nIndependence of \nprofessionals and \nrole of \ncommercialism in \nlegal advice \n \nThe role of lawyers in society is diverse \nthanks to variable heritages influenced \nby lawyers\u2019 relationship with the state.  \n \n \n\u2022 US lawyers are zealous promoters of capitalism and have always been autonomous from the \nstate. Large corporate law firms emerged in the early 1900s; \n\u2022 English lawyers increasingly entrepreneurial from 1960s onwards. Large law firms (more than \n25 partners) allowed since 1967;  \n\u2022 Germany lawyers traditionally civil servants and advised corporations of the law and its \nrequirements, not how to manipulate it. Only recently has the idea of lawyers as corporate \nservice providers emerged and only since 1987 have large corporate law firms been permitted.  \n \n \nRemuneration \nstructure \n \nThe \u2018lockstep\u2019 system (all partners \nshare profits with individual\u2019s share \ndetermined by seniority) versus \u2018eat \nwhat you kill\u2019 (an individual\u2019s profits \nreflect those they generated for the \nfirm).  \n \n \n\u2022 The perception of lawyers being \u2018defenders\u2019 of capitalism in the USA leads to increased use of \njudicial processes with one corporate lawyer defending or promoting the case of their client to \na judge. Consequently, eat what you kill individualism dominates. \n\u2022 English corporate lawyers rarely find themselves in such an adversarial courtroom role, instead \nnormally acting as a team to negotiate on behalf of a client. Lockstep system thus preferred. \n  \n \nLawyers as \nautonomous sole \npractitioners \nversus team-\nworkers  \n \nMost marked between civil law \n(autonomous individuals) and common \nlaw jurisdictions. \n \n\u2022 Anglo-American common law lawyers used to working in teams to deal with the complexities \nof interpreting regulation. \n\u2022 Continental European civil law lawyers used to acting as autonomous technical experts where \nvalue gained from an individual\u2019s expertise. \n \n 39 \nTable 4. The effects of negotiations on the practices of lawyers in overseas offices. \nSource: Interviews, The Lawyer (1999, 2004, 2005) and Financial Times (2005). \n \n \n  \n Situation  \n \nInfluences on \nmeanings of work \ncausing differences \n \nImplications  \n \nChange strategy \nemployed \n \nQuote exemplifying challenge\/solution \n \n \nOffices outside of USA \nand Western Europe \nweren\u2019t meeting service \nstandards and following \n\u2018best practice\u2019 \nprocedures used in \nmerger and acquisitions \ntransactions. \n \nExperience of \u2018team-\nworking\u2019 and \nunderstanding of the \nneed for procedures all \nfollow when in a big \nteam varied between \njurisdictions. \n \nTransnational clients do \nnot receive the same \nstandard of service \nfrom each office.  \n \nPractice-leaders from \u2018gold \nstandard\u2019 jurisdictions, \nrespected because of their \nexpertise and track-record, \ncoach colleagues in other \noffices and socialise them \ninto the firm\u2019s \u2018best \npractice\u2019.  \n \n \n\u201cThere are only certain offices in the network that \nare allowed to run multi-jurisdictional deals.  \nThey tend to be the money markets, so Chicago, \nNew York, London and Frankfurt.  So we tend to \nfind that they\u2019re the offices that go off and train \nother offices on what the practices are for doing a \nmulti-jurisdictional deal.  So once a year, people \nfrom the London office go off and train all of \nLatin America associates on global M&A and try \nand get them to buy into our ways of working (1, \npartner, London). \n \nDifferent remuneration \ncultures (i.e. eat what \nyou kill versus lockstep). \n \nEducational \nexperiences, \nconfounded by \ndiffering degrees of \nindividualism and \ncollaboration in work \ngenerally, created \nvariations in cultures of \npay between countries. \n \nImplementation of \nworldwide model \nnecessary to create an \nintegrated partnership.  \n \nDevelop hybrid model that \nadapts lockstep to allow \nsuper point rewards for \nexceptional performance. \nLawyers had to be \nconvinced by the managing \nand senior partner that this \nchange was right for the \nfirm.  \n \n\u201cOur conclusion has been that its better to have a \nbusiness in the US that\u2019s aligned to our overall \nculture than to allow it to develop as a separate \nsub-culture with a different set of values, \nprimarily because if you have a different culture \nwith a different set of values, and you\u2019re \npersisting with the \u2018one firm\u2019 approach, you can\u2019t \nhelp but to have real tensions because the cultures \njust don\u2019t mesh\u201d (2, managing partner, London). \n \n \n"}
