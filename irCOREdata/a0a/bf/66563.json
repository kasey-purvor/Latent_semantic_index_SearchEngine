Res., 40, W07202, doi:10.1029\/2003WR002759.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Grain size measurements of fluvial gravels are a\nfundamental descriptor for many fields of geomorphological\nresearch, including sediment transport [e.g., Middleton and\nSouthard, 1984; Wiberg and Smith, 1987] and the study of\nflow resistance and the prediction of flow velocities in open\nchannel flow [e.g., Bray, 1982; Clifford et al., 1992]. Fur-\nthermore, grain size has also been demonstrated to be an\nimportant variable for the habitat preferences of salmonids\n[e.g., Rimmer et al., 1983; Cunjak, 1988; Heggenes, 1996].\nMethods for the field measurements of the grain size distri-\nbutions of fluvial sediment are well established and are the\nsubject of many studies [Wolman, 1954; Hey and Thorne,\n1983;Church et al., 1987; Rice and Church, 1996; Bunte and\nAbt, 2001]. Generally, these methods are labor intensive and\nrequire a significant amount of fieldwork to implement.\nConsequently, the time needed to acquire grain size measure-\nments may limit the size of the area that can be sampled.\n[3] However, there has been growing interest in the\ndevelopment of methods which could potentially reduce\nthe field effort associated with grain size data collection and\nso increase the area that may be sampled. These methods\ntypically rely on photographs of the bed. Also called\nphotosieving, they involve taking plan view images of\ngravels either in exposed areas [Adams, 1979; Ibbeken\nand Schleyer, 1986; Butler et al., 2001a] or shallow sub-\nmerged areas [Whitman et al., 2003]. Generally, images of\nthe riverbed are collected from standing position with some\nform of scale information in each image. This yields images\nthat cover up to \u00011 m2 (e.g., 0.4 m2 [Bunte and Abt, 2001]).\nThese images are then analyzed either using manual mea-\nsurements [e.g., Adams, 1979] or using automated image\nsegmentation and measurement [Butler et al., 2001a]. The\nmain advantage of photosieving lies in the fact that actual\nmeasurement of the clasts does not take place in the field,\nwhich saves field effort. However, photosieving has three\nmain disadvantages. First, the method is limited to mea-\nsurement of the visible surface of gravels. Therefore photo-\nsieving is not applicable in cases where subsurface grain\nsizes are required. Second, the minimal clast size that can be\nanalyzed is typically in the gravel range, for example,\nIbbeken and Schleyer [1986] only considered particles\ncoarser than 20 mm, and Butler et al. [2001a] followed\nthe recommendations of Wolman [1954], designed for\nmanual grain size measurements, and set the lower thresh-\nold of measurable size to 8 mm. These thresholds are\ndirectly related to image scale. Provided that sufficient\nimage texture is present, higher-resolution imagery should\nallow for the detection of sand and silt particles. However,\ngiven current imaging technology, the detection of individ-\nual sand grains would require images with extremely low\nspatial coverage, of the order of a few square centimeters.\nThis is clearly not practical for reach of river-scale studies,\nand thus photosieving is not applicable to sands, silts, and\nclays and is more suitable to gravely environments.

This bias has two causes. The\nfirst is the approximation of the actual clast dimensions in\nthree-dimensional space from their projection in a two-\ndimensional image. Second is that the hiding effect of\nneighboring, overlapping, and interlocking (i.e., armored)\nclasts will cause additional bias. Ibbeken and Schleyer\n[1986] have found that while photosieving does cause a\nbias, this bias is acceptably small and the correction may\nusually be neglected. Adams [1979] found a significant bias\nand used an appropriate correction factor. However, Church\net al. [1987] note that the magnitude of this correction factor\nwill depend on the degree of imbrication and the angle of the\nclasts within the bed fabric. Therefore generalized correction\nfactors are difficult to justify.\n[4] The computer automation of photosieving techniques\ncould allow for a significant increase in the volume of grain\nsize information that is collected. However, even if auto-\nmated methods were applied to process 0.4 m2 images,\n1000 images would be required to cover 400 m2. Such\ntechniques are therefore limited to small river reaches and\nare impractical when grain size information over very large\nscales (>10 km) is of interest. For example, Rice and\nChurch [1998] used grain size data sampled at the river\nscale to show that downstream fining is not continuous\nalong a given river. This allowed for the development of the\nconcept of the sedimentary link. Furthermore, Fausch et al.\n[2002] propose that fluvial habitat modeling of aquatic\nspecies must be extended to the scale of the entire river.\nGiven that grain size distribution is a fundamental parameter\nof aquatic habitat [Guay et al., 2000], catchment-scale grain\nestimations will be necessary. Since both field measure-\nments and photosieving are not easily applicable at the river\nscale, there is a need for alternative methods.\n[5] Airborne multispectral remote sensing techniques\nhave already been successfully applied to large-scale geo-\nmorphological work in fluvial environments [Winterbottom\nand Gilvear, 1997; Wright et al., 2000; Zhang, 2000;\nLegleiter et al., 2002]. These authors demonstrated that it\nis possible to classify morphological units in fluvial envi-\nronments such as pools, riffles, and rapids from multispec-\ntral imagery with resolutions ranging from 0.25 to 3 m.\nFurthermore, an empirical method of automated grain size\nmeasurement using a combination of centimeter-resolution\nairborne digital color imagery and close range millimeter\nresolution imagery has been proposed by Verdu\u00b4 et al [2003].\nThese authors used one-dimensional semivariance measure-\nments combined with data acquired using close range\nimagery to determine grain size measurements from high-\nresolution airborne digital imagery. They report an R2 value\nof 0.86 between predicted and observed values for grain\nsizes.\n[6] The work presented here is part of a larger research\nproject, GEOSALAR, which aims to apply geomatics and\nremote sensing techniques to river-scale mapping of the\nphysical habitat of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The\nspecific objective of this work is to obtain an automated\nmethod of grain size estimation capable of yielding reliable\nvalues for the median diameter (D50) of dry exposed surface\ngravels, with a spatial resolution of the order of 1 m. This\nstudy first considers both image texture and two-dimen-\nsional semivariance as theoretical bases for the estimation of\ngrain sizes from airborne imagery. These tools are tested on\ntwo sets of digital imagery with ground resolutions of 3 and\n10 cm. Ground truth grain size data were correlated to local\nimage properties in order to establish predictive relation-\nships. Subsequently, independent validation of the predic-\ntive relationships was carried out with manually collected\nfield data. The validation results show that the observed\ncorrelation between local image texture and grain size is less\nreliable than the correlation relationship between grain size\nand local semivariance. Therefore local image semivariance\nwas used to develop a new method for fully automated grain\nsize measurement from high-resolution digital airborne\nimagery.\n2. Mapping Grain Size From Airborne\nImagery: Theoretical Considerations\n[7] This section presents the currently known image\nprocessing theory and established methods that could allow\nfor the development of automated grain size mapping. In\norder to develop automated grain size mapping, quantitative\nimage properties which can be used to predict the size of\ngravels in an image must be found. These properties can\nthen be used to predict grain sizes in either a physical\nmodeling approach or an empirical modeling approach.\n[8] Physical modeling involves the use of known physical\nproperties of the gravel patches under a given illumination to\npredict the radiometric and reflective characteristics of the\ngravels as a function of their grain size. Such approaches\nhave been applied with success in the field of canopy\nreflectance modeling [Baret et al., 1994; Borel and Gerstl,\n1994]. In the case of fluvial gravels, the main image\ncharacteristic is the presence of light-dark contact zones\ncreated by gravels and their shadow. It is reasonable to\nassume that these light-dark contact zones will be affected\nby grain size since larger particles will have larger light\nareas and will also produce larger shadows. Therefore\npredicting the radiometric and reflective characteristics of\ngravels would require physical models for the reflection\nand dispersion of light and the statistical spatial distribu-\ntion of shaded areas as a function of surface roughness,\ngravel lithology, and illumination. While some progress\nhas been made in the field of modeling the roughness of\ngravels [Robert, 1991; Bergeron, 1998; Butler et al.,\n2001b], the modeling of the spatial distributions of shaded\nareas and the prediction of gravel image texture as a\nfunction of lighting conditions and particle size remains\nan extremely complex and difficult problem. This difficul-\nty is reflected in the absence of published work describing\nmethods of grain size estimation based on the physical\nprediction of their image texture.\n[9] The empirical approach is a black box method that\nseeks to establish a statistical relationship between local\nimage properties and ground truth data. This approach is\nconceptually simpler and, if properly applied, could allow\nfor a characterization of the complex image textures asso-\nciated with fluvial gravels. However, appropriate image\nproperties that are highly sensitive to image texture must\nbe identified. Furthermore, calibration data are required in\norder to establish an empirical predictive relationship be-\n2 of 11\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS W07202\ntween an image property and grain size. Examination of the\navailable literature reveals two image properties that could\npotentially be used for grain size mapping: image texture\nand semivariance.\n[10] Image texture, as defined by the cooccurrence\nmatrix, was among the first local image properties to be\ndeveloped capable of segmenting image areas that appear\nvisually distinct to a human observer [Haralick et al., 1973;\nHaralick, 1979; Conners et al., 1984]. It is therefore\nreasonable to hypothesize that image texture may allow\nfor grain size determination since patches of different grain\nsizes appear distinct to a human observer provided image\nresolution is sufficient. Semivariance is also frequently\nemployed in digital image processing [Wulder and Boots,\n1998]. For example, Miranda and Carr [1994] have shown\nthat semivariance can distinguish between different species\nof vegetation when applied to spaceborne imaging radar-B\n(SIR-B) imagery, and Verdu\u00b4 et al. [2003] have successfully\nused semivariance to predict grain sizes. Image semivar-\niance and texture were therefore tested as possible image\nproperties capable of deriving grain size from airborne\ndigital imagery.\n[11] Image texture is defined as an attribute representing\nthe spatial arrangement of the gray levels of the pixels in a\nregion [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n(IEEE), 1990]. Texture-based analysis operates by trans-\nforming a raw image into a textural image, where regional\ntexture information is represented as gray levels. Image\ntexture is evaluated with the cooccurrence matrix. The\ncooccurrence matrix is constructed by comparing all image\npixels separated by a distance D at direction ~d. The i, jth\nelement of the cooccurrence matrix P for an image is the\nnumber of times that gray levels i and j occur in two pixels\nseparated by distance D and direction~d divided by the total\nnumber of pixel pairs [Castleman, 1996]. Therefore cooc-\ncurrence can quantify how many pixels of similar gray\nlevels are neighbors. The cooccurrence matrix is of size\n(L, L), where L is the number of gray levels in the image\n(256 for 8 bit gray scale images). However, calculation of a\n256 \u0002 256 cooccurrence matrix remains computationally\ndemanding even with current desktop computers. To make\ncomputation times manageable, images are typically\nresampled to 8, 16, or 32 gray levels. Once the cooccurrence\nmatrix is calculated, textural features may be derived to\nreduce the information in the cooccurrence matrix to a\nsingle value [Haralick et al., 1973; Conners et al., 1984;\nCastleman, 1996]. Among these textural inertia is of par-\nticular interest in this case. Textural inertia is a dimension-\nless parameter defined as [Conners et al., 1984]\nI \u00bc\nXL\u00041\ni\u00bc0\nXL\u00041\nj\u00bc0\ni\u0004 j\u00f0 \u00de2Pij; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere I is the textural inertia and i and j are the brightness\nlevels in the cooccurrence matrix P of size (L, L). The form\nof equation (1) justifies its potential interest for the present\napplication. The term (i \u0004 j)2 has the effect of eliminating\nthe contribution of diagonal terms in the cooccurrence\nmatrix where I = j. Furthermore, the exponent in the term\nhas the effect of exaggerating the contribution of values in\nthe cooccurrence matrix where i greatly differs from j.\nTherefore textural inertia hides areas where equal brightness\nlevels are in contact, and it highlights areas where different\nbrightness levels are in contact. This should be well suited\nto images of gravel beds characterized by light-dark contact\nareas between uniform colored clasts and shaded zones.\n[12] The second property under consideration is local\nsemivariance. Verdu\u00b4 et al. [2003] used one-dimensional\nsemivariance estimates originally developed for the analysis\nof one-dimensional data. However, one-dimensional semi-\nvariance is defined for one-dimensional, time series\u2013type\ndata. It is therefore not capable of processing data arranged\nin a raster format such as a digital image. It is therefore\nnecessary to extend one-dimensional semivariance to two\ndimensions if the information content of digital images is to\nbe fully exploited. Two-dimensional semivariance can be\ndefined by the following [Carbonneau et al., 2003]:\ng p; q\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\n2 N \u0004 pj j\u00f0 \u00de M \u0004 qj j\u00f0 \u00de\nXN\u0004\npj j\u00fep\n2\ni\u00bc1\u00fe pj j\u0004p\n2\n\t\nXM\u0004\nqj j\u00feq\n2\nj\u00bc1\u00fe qj j\u0004q\n2\nZ i\u00fe p; j\u00fe q\u00f0 \u00de \u0004 Z i; j\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u000b2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere p and q are the lags in the x and y directions, M and N\nare the dimensions of the surface in the x and y directions,\nand Z(i, j) is the variable of interest, in this case brightness\nlevel, at point (i, j). The two-dimensional semivariogram is\ntherefore a raster of values giving half the variance for every\ncombination of lags p and q. Semivariance has units that are\nthe square of the units of Z. For images, brightness values\nare dimensionless. Therefore image semivariance is dimen-\nsionless and will be referred to without units throughout this\narticle.\n[13] The semivariance recognizes that the variance in\nbrightness levels between pixels separated by a certain\ndistance will be a function of that distance. For the case\nof a raster image with a checkerboard pattern (i.e., alternat-\ning white and black pixels in a raster) the maximum semi-\nvariance will be reached for a lag of 1. If the checkerboard\nis made of alternating 2 pixel \u0002 2 pixel areas, the maximum\nsemivariance will be reached for a lag of 2. Hence there\nshould be a relationship between the grain size of an image\npatch and the lag at which the maximum semivariance (the\nsill) is reached. However, this does not take into account the\ndiscretization effects encountered when sampling real con-\ntinuous phenomena with discreet pixels of finite size. If the\ngrains are smaller than the pixel size (also called pixel\nground footprint), then one pixel will sample several grains\nand their associated shadow areas. Therefore the brightness\nlevel of the pixel will have a mixed spectral signature, and\nits brightness will be an averaged value. The semivariance\nsill for a raster of such pixels cannot be clearly related to the\ngrain size. However, the semivariance value of the sill\nshould be reduced due to the averaging effect of the\nsampling which reduces the difference between maximum\nand minimum brightness values. As particles in the image\nget coarser, there is an increased probability that pixels will\ncover more homogeneous zones of light or shadow. There-\nfore the pixel brightness values will more closely represent\nthe actual continuous illumination variations of the surface\nand less averaging will occur. Thus the maximum difference\nbetween light and dark areas will be increased, and the\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS\n3 of 11\nW07202\nsemivariance sill value will also be of higher magnitude. It\ncan therefore be hypothesized that grain size can be corre-\nlated with the sill value of local image semivariance.\nFigure 1 shows an example of two semivariograms and\nillustrates that the sill plane is sensitive to image size. The\ndisappearance of the sill plane is symptomatic of nonstatio-\nnarity caused by a trend in the image data [Rossi et al.,\n1992]. Trends in image data are caused by objects of uniform\ncolor that are of comparable scale to the image. In such\ncases, the semivariogram will display a strong anisotropy\nwhich will reflect the orientation of the large object in the\noriginal image. The use of the semivariogram sill in image\nprocessing is therefore limited to cases where the objects in\nan image are much smaller than the total image dimensions.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Airborne Digital Imagery Acquisition\n[14] Field work for the study was carried out on the\n80 km long main branch of the Sainte-Marguerite River in\nQuebec, Canada. In August 2002, two helicopter surveys\nwere carried out during the summer period of low flow. The\nXEOS\nTM\nsystem, developed by GENIVAR Inc., was used to\nobtain plan view digital imagery of the entire 80 km study\narea. The helicopter surveys were carried out at heights\nabove the bed of 450 m and 155 m in order to obtain digital\nimagery with ground resolutions of 10 cm (1:1200 scale)\nand 3 cm (1:350 scale), respectively. Image format was\n3008 pixels \u0002 1960 pixels in the standard visible bands of\nred, green, and blue. Images were collected at 60% overlap\nto allow for photogrammetric work to be carried out in the\nfuture. Two days were required to complete the surveys\nyielding 1600 ten-centimeter-resolution images and 5600\nthree-centimeter-resolution images. Flights were carried out\nbetween 10:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. with weather conditions\nbeing generally cloudy and dry with infrequent sunny\nspells. Figure 2 shows examples of images for both avail-\nable resolutions.\n3.2. Photocontrol and Image Georeferencing\n[15] Photocontrol points were collected with a Leica RTK\nGPS 500 system capable of centimeter-scale accuracy.\nIdentifiable natural features such as logs and large clasts\nor man-made features such as roadside guard railings were\nused as targets for photocontrol. Additionally, \u0001600 artifi-\ncial targets were placed along the river prior to the flight and\nwere subsequently surveyed. This survey required\u00013 weeks\nof field work to complete. Image georeferencing was\nundertaken using the georeferencing tool in ArcMap (ESRI\nFigure 1. Examples of two-dimensional semivariograms\nillustrating both sill plane presence and absence. (a) Two-\ndimennsional semivariogram for a 33 \u0002 33 pixel image.\n(b) Two-dimensional semivariogram for a 20 pixel \u0002\n20 pixel image.\nFigure 2. Examples of high-resolution airborne imagery\nfrom the Sainte-Marguerite River located at 48.38\u0001N,\n70.20\u0001W: (a) 3 cm image; (b) 10 cm image.\n4 of 11\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS W07202\nInc., Redlands, California). This tool allows the user to\nassociate image points with their geographic coordinates. At\nleast two points are required to perform the affine transfor-\nmation that determines the orientation and scale of an\nimage. When additional points are added, a least squares\nregression algorithm was applied to determine optimal\ngeoreferencing results. The quality of the georeferencing\nprocess was examined with the total RMS error output by\nArcMap (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California). In this case, the\nmean RMS error for all 3 cm images was \u00b127.8 cm, and it\nwas \u00b1120 cm for 10 cm images.\n3.3. Ground Truth Grain Size Data\n[16] Grain sizes along the river range from coarse sand to\nboulder. In order to obtain a similar size range over a small\nreach, amidchannel bar covered by 10 imageswas selected as\na pilot study site. This particular bar was selected because it\npresented the full range of grain sizes present along the river,\nthus allowing for reliable calibration of the methodology.\nGrain size calibration data were obtained with a close range\nphotosieving technique selected to reduce the field time\nrequired to obtain ground truth data. Furthermore, by using\nplan view images as ground truth data, bias due to particle\nimbrication should be similar in both the ground truth images\nand the airborne images. Seventy plan view digital images\nwere taken along the midchannel bar with a commercial\ndigital camera. Image format was 1600 pixels\u0002 1200 pixels.\nFor each image, which covered about 1.2 m \u0002 0.9 m\n(1.08 m2), a ruler was placed in the top of the frame to\nestablish scale. The center of the ruler was surveyed with\nthe Leica RTK GPS 500 to establish the position of the\nclose range images on the airborne photos. In anticipation\nof potential georeferencing errors, close range images\nwere taken in the middle of uniform patches whose area\nexceeded 1 m2.\n[17] Grain sizes for these close range images were deter-\nmined with a graphic user interface programmed in the\nMATLAB environment (The Mathworks Inc., Natik, Mas-\nsachusetts). A 5 \u0002 10 grid was first superimposed on the\nimages. The user then manually identified with the mouse\nthe a and b axis of clasts which were at the 50 grid\nintersections, and the program output the D50 for the image.\nA value of 0 mm was assigned to sand surfaces.\n3.4. Image Classification\n[18] Image processing was first applied to perform a\nclassification of the dry bed areas using MATLAB (The\nMathworks Inc., Natik, Massachusetts). Dry bed areas in the\nimages were identified with histogram segmentation of\nthe intensity band in hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color\nformat. HSI is an alternative color format to the widespread\nred-blue-green (RGB) format. Instead of representing color\nwith three orthogonal components, as in the RGB format,\nthe HSI format represents color in a spherical coordinate\nformat where the hue and the saturation values are equiv-\nalent to the azimuthal and polar angles, respectively, and the\nintensity is equivalent to distance from the origin. In the\nintensity band, dry exposed gravels have a higher brightness\nvalue and are well suited to automated thresholding meth-\nods. In this case, Otsu\u2019s method [Otsu, 1979] was applied to\nisolate the dry exposed gravels from the rest of the image.\nThis histogram-based method is designed to produce a\nsegmentation threshold that minimizes the variance within\nthe two resulting classes in the histogram. The performance\nof the classification algorithm was verified by selecting\n10 images and manually tracing contours of the dry bed\nareas and comparing surface dimensions of manual and\nautomated classification as a percentage. For dry bed areas\nthe mean difference is 3.1%, and the standard deviation of\nthe difference is 4.2%. Figure 3 presents a binary classifi-\ncation with dry bed areas in black.\n3.5. Image Corrections\n[19] The classification results were used to correct the\nimages before grain size estimation procedures. For each\ngrain size estimation method discussed in section 2, local\nimage texture correlation, and local two-dimensional semi-\nvariance correlation a different correction was applied,\nirrespective of image resolution. Image texture was found\nto be sensitive to illumination changes in the imagery that\ncan be caused by variations in daylight or camera exposure\ntimes. Therefore the brightness of the images was corrected\nto compensate for illumination changes during the air\nsurvey. It was found that conventional histogram equaliza-\ntion or histogram stretches saturated the brightness levels in\nlarge areas and thus gave poor results. Therefore a simple\nhistogram shift was applied to give dry gravel patches an\nequal mean brightness level of 150. Semivariance methods,\nwhich operate on the basis of differences in brightness\nlevels, are insensitive to histogram shifts. However, semi-\nvariance methods would predictably be very sensitive in\nedge areas where the dark colored wetted perimeter pixels\nare in contact with lighter dry bed pixels. Therefore the\nclassification results were used to reset the brightness levels\nof all pixels in the wetted and vegetated areas (the \u2018\u2018not\u2019\u2019 dry\narea in the Boolean logic sense) of the image to the mean dry\nbed pixel value. This resulted in a reduced contrast along the\nedges of the dry bed area.\n3.6. Mapping Local Image Properties: The Sampling\nWindow Method\n[20] The image properties described in section 2 are\ntypically calculated for entire images. However, if the entire\nimage is reduced to single semivariance sill plane or textural\nFigure 3. Binary image showing automatically detected\ndry bed areas in Figure 1a.\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS\n5 of 11\nW07202\ninertia value, spatial location of texture and semivariance\ninformation are lost. It is therefore necessary to adopt a\nsampling window mapping approach. Instead of calculating\ntexture and semivariance for the entire image, these prop-\nerties are calculated for a small subsample of the image, the\nsampling window. By displacing the sampling window over\nthe image it is possible to map local image properties and\nthus retain spatial information about the variation of local\nimage properties. The resulting property map will hereafter\nbe termed the property image. Thus the semivariogram or\ncooccurrence is calculated for each window of size (W, W)\nin the original (M, N) image. Semivariance is then reduced\nto a single value by taking the mean value of the sill plane,\nand cooccurrence is expressed by the inertia value. The\nresulting image has dimensions (M\/W, N\/W). Therefore, in\nthe property image the i, jth pixel is the local property value\nin the region [i:i +W \u0004 1; j:j +W \u0004 1] of the original image.\nThese property images can be used to test for correlation\nbetween local image properties and grain size in airborne\ndigital imagery.\n3.7. Optimal Window Size Selection\n[21] The sampling window method requires the selection\nof a suitable window size. Since no theoretical guidelines\nexist for the optimal determination of window sizes, several\nwindow sizes were tested in order to assess the sensitivity of\nvarying window sizes and to produce guidelines for optimal\nwindow size selection. The study objective of producing\ngrain size maps with a spatial resolution of 1 m was used to\nobtain starting values of window size. This corresponds to\n33 pixels \u0002 33 pixels in the 3-cm-resolution imagery and\n10 pixels \u0002 10 pixels in the 10 cm imagery. The range of\nwindow sizes, selected to include these values, was there-\nfore set to 5 \u0002 5, 10 \u0002 10, 20 \u0002 20, 33 \u0002 33, and 50 \u0002 50.\nProperty images for semivariance and texture were calcu-\nlated for all window sizes and for both image resolutions.\nThis yielded 20 distinct grain size data sets that will require\ncalibration and validation.\n3.8. Predictive Model Calibration\n[22] Once the 20 property images were calculated, the\nvalues of semivariance or texture were extracted at\nthe locations where ground truth data was available. The\nposition of the ground truth grain size data was found by\ninterpolating the property image to the same resolution as\nthe original RGB image. A new false color image was then\ncreated by substituting the blue band with the property\nimage. In order for this operation to work the property data\nmust be rescaled, with a linear function, to the range [0 255].\nThis false color image was then automatically georefer-\nenced by applying the same ground control point file as for\nthe original RGB image. Thus the value of the false blue\nband, the property band, was read at the coordinates of the\nground truth data and retransformed to the original property\nvalues with the scaling relationship. The ground truth b axis\ngrain sizes were then plotted against the extracted local\nimage properties for each given location. The relationships\nthus obtained, if any, could then be applied to estimate grain\nsizes in areas where no ground truth data was available.\n3.9. Model Validation\n[23] In order to validate the predictive relationships estab-\nlished between image properties and grain sizes, independent\ndata was obtained (C. Davey, personal communication,\n2003). This data set consists of 15 manual bulk sampling\nmeasurements of the b axis D50 of the dry bed armor layer.\nTheD50 of the armor (i.e., surface) layer was selected because\nit corresponds to the visible portion of the bed material.\nFurthermore, since bulk sampling involves the removal and\nmeasurement of all the particle of the armor layer, irrespec-\ntive of their size, this method removes any photosieving-type\nerrors associated with the hiding effect of overlapping clasts\nand the minimal clast size restrictions. The data collection\nsites were scattered along a 10 km stretch of the Sainte-\nMarguerite River. Therefore each data point could be found\non a single image, none of which have been used in the\ncorrelation model. Grain size maps were therefore calculated\nfor these 15 images. Data point locations were provided with\na precision estimated at \u00b11 m. Therefore predicted grain sizes\nfor each validation point location were extracted from the\ngrain size maps by taking the mean grain size calculated in a\n1 m \u0002 1 m window centered on the point location. Predicted\ngrain sizes versus observed grain sizes were then plotted to\nestablish model validity. Furthermore, the mean and standard\ndeviation of the differences between predicted and observed\npoints were calculated to obtain quality assessment. These\nresults are expressed both as absolute values, in centimeters,\nand in normalized form, as a percentage of the local D50.\n4. Calibration and Validation Results\n[24] Table 1 gives the results of the model calibration\nrelationships according to the size of the window that was\nused (both in pixel units and in centimeters), the resolution\nof the images, and the image property that was applied. In\nTable 1 the NS entry signifies that semivariograms for a\ngiven window size did not have a sill plane and thus that the\nmethod is inapplicable.\n[25] It was decided that only models where the majority\nof the variability was explained (i.e., with an R2 > 0.5)\nwould be studied further and validated. R2 values in Table 1\nrange from 0.27 to 0.8. Acceptable levels of explanation are\nonly found in the case of 3 cm imagery. In total, five models\nwere validated. For the local image texture method, 20 \u0002 20\nwindows, 33 \u0002 33 windows, and 50 \u0002 50 windows\napplications were validated. For the local semivariance\nmethod, only the 33 \u0002 33 window and the 50 \u0002 50 window\nwere considered. Table 2 presents the results of the model\nvalidation carried out with the independent data. While the\nR2 values indicate good linear relationships between ob-\nserved and predicted data, slope values for the regressions\nshow many cases where predicted values are underesti-\nmated. Furthermore, high bias values (intercepts) can be\nobserved in most cases. However, in the case of the 33 \u0002 33\nwindow used with local semivariance, validation results are\nexcellent. This model was therefore selected as the optimal\nmethod for this study. Figure 4 shows the regression plots\nfor calibration and validation of this selected method. The\nerror for the method was examined further with the mean\nand standard deviation of the differences between observed\nand predicted values. The mean difference was \u00040.28 cm\nwith a standard deviation of 1.39 cm. If normalized by the\noverall D50, this is a bias (systematic error) of \u00041.4% and a\nprecision of \u00b115.4%. Once validated, the regression equa-\ntion for the 33 \u0002 33 sampling window applied to 3 cm\n6 of 11\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS W07202\nimagery can be used to predict grain sizes from semi-\nvariance property images (Figure 5).\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Guidelines for Successful Implementation of Grain\nSize Estimation Models\n[26] On the basis of our results, six important parameters\ncan be identified for successful implementation of grain size\nmapping: sampling window size (W), image resolution (i.e.,\npixel ground footprint) (R), scale of ground truth data (GT),\nscale of uniform gravel patches (GP), median particle size\n(D50), and the minimum number of pixels required for a\ntwo-dimensional semivariogram to present a sill plane (SS).\nFor grain size estimation to be successful the required\nrelationship between these parameters can be inferred from\nour experimental results and expressed by the following\nequations:\nW \f SS; \u00f03\u00de\nWR \r GP; \u00f04\u00de\nWR \u000e GT; \u00f05\u00de\nD50 \f R: \u00f06\u00de\n[27] Equation (3) states that the sampling window must\nbe of sufficient extent to ensure the presence of a sill plane\nin the semivariogram. As discussed in section 2, the absence\nof a sill plane renders the semivariance method unusable. In\nthis particular case, if the sampling window is too small, it\nbecomes possible for a few individual clasts to occupy a\nlarge part of the window. This will cause trend and lead to\nthe disappearance of the sill plane. Table 1 and Figure 1\nsupport this analysis by showing that for smaller window\nsizes, sill planes were not present.\n[28] Equation (4) states that the ground footprint of the\nsampling window (i.e., the actual size of the window in real\nspace), WR, should be smaller than the scale of uniform\ngravel patches in the study area. The semivariance and\ntexture methods both implicitly assume that the area within\nthe sampling window consists of a uniform gravel patch.\nCareful examination of the imagery used to calibrate the\nmethod (Figure 2a) and manual measurements of individual\npatches show that patch sizes range from 0.9 to 10 m2.\nTherefore, in the cases where the ground footprint of the\nsampling window is greater than \u000e1 m2, the sampling\nwindow will frequently be straddling two or more uniform\ngravel patches. The effect of having multiple patches in a\ngiven sampling window was examined further by taking\nthree image samples of 33 \u0002 33 pixels at a resolution of\n3 cm. The first consisted of uniform fine gravels. The area\nof the second sample was half covered by fine gravels with\nthe other half covered by cobbles. Finally, the third con-\nsisted of uniform cobbles. The semivariograms and inertia\nvalues were then calculated and examined for these three\nsamples. For the first sample, semivariance sill plane value\nwas 284, and textural inertia was 1.2. For the second\nsample, semivariance sill plane value was 78, and textural\ninertia was 0.6. Finally, for the third sample, semivariance\nsill plane value was 42, and textural inertia was 0.08. The\nmean value of the sill plane for the mixed sample was\ntherefore intermediate to those of the fine gravel and cobble\nsamples. A similar result was obtained with the textural\ninertia values with the inertia of the mixed surface being\nbetween the inertias for fine gravels and cobbles. This\nTable 1.

This is not a problem if the\npatch scale is greater than the sampling window. In such a\ncase, contact areas between patches will yield a grain size\ngradient, but the central area of the patches will have\nsemivariance and inertia values that reflect the grain size\nof the patch. However, if the patch scale is smaller than the\nsampling window, it will not be possible to interpret the\ninertia and semivariance sill values as being associated with\na single grain size. Therefore, as window size increases, the\nstatistical benefits gained by the larger sample size (i.e.,\nlarger window size) are offset by more than one grain size\ndistribution appearing in the sample population, thus lead-\ning to a loss of model quality when window size is larger\nthan the patch scale (equation (4)). This effect is clear in\nTables 1 and 2, where a strong dependency on sampling\nwindow size can be seen. For both the textural and semi-\nvariance methods, validation quality degrades when com-\nparing 33 \u0002 33 and 50 \u0002 50 windows. As indicated in\nTable 1, the ground footprint of 33 \u0002 33 windows in 3 cm\nimagery is 99 cm \u0002 99 cm. This corresponds almost exactly\nto the 1 m \u0002 1 m scale of the ground truth imagery. In the\ncase of the 50 \u0002 50 windows, the ground footprint increases\nto 150 cm \u0002 150 cm. Table 1 therefore shows that as the\nground footprint departs from the 1 m2 scale of the ground\ntruth data, model quality degrades.\n[29] A similar issue arises when considering the scale at\nwhich the ground truth data are collected. Equation (5)\nstates that when establishing a correlation model between\nlocal image properties and ground truth grain size data, the\narea over which the ground truth grain sizes were measured\nshould be comparable to the ground footprint sampling\nwindow size. If this is not the case and the sampling\nwindow is too large, when local image properties for the\nground truth data area are evaluated, they will be affected by\nparticles not measured in the ground truth data. This is\nlikely to be one of the major factors contributing to the\nfailure of grain size estimation in 10 cm imagery. Table 1\nshows that in all attempts made with 10 cm imagery, results\nwere poor. However, it is possible that if ground truth data\nwere collected at the proper scale, useful grain size infor-\nmation could be collected from 10 cm airborne digital\nimagery.\n[30] The final consideration is the image resolution with\nrespect to particle size. Equation (6) states an idealized\ncondition where the pixel size of the image is smaller than\nall particles in the image. Given that current airborne\nimaging technology is capable of centimeter-scale resolu-\ntions, the condition in equation (6) cannot be met for clays,\nsilts, sands, and fine gravels. It is therefore necessary to\nFigure 4.

As discussed in\nsection 2, the main source of brightness variations in gravel\nimages is the clast-shadow contact areas whose size scales\nwith the particle size. Therefore, in areas where the image\npixel ground footprint is significantly greater than particle\nsize, both clast and shadow contact areas will be contained\nwithin any given pixel. This will average out the brightness,\nand the variation will be lost, which could be expected to\nlead to a failure of grain size estimation methods for particle\nsizes smaller than the pixel ground footprint sizes. However,\nerror assessment results for grain size estimates derived\nfrom 3 cm imagery using local semivariance calculated over\n33 pixels \u0002 33 pixel sampling windows show that mean\nerror was \u00040.28 cm with a standard deviation of 1.39 cm.\nBoth these results are well below the pixel size which\ndemonstrates the subpixel sensitivity of the method. How-\never, examination of Figure 4a shows a departure from\nlinearity at small sizes. This loss of quality at small scale\ncan partially be attributed to particle size being smaller than\nmedian grain size. Furthermore, a size-dependent noise\neffect is present. Examination of Figure 4a reveals a series\nof points near the origin with a grain size of 0 mm (sand)\nand semivariance values ranging from 5 to 50. Close\nexamination of the photosieving images and the airborne\nimages shows the presence of small woody debris and\nshrubs. The color of the debris and shrubs is often in\ncontrast to the color of neighboring pixels. Therefore this\ncan have an effect on image texture and semivariance. In the\ncase of coarse clasts, where the pixel size is smaller than the\nparticle size, the texture and semivariance values associated\nto the clasts themselves are high, and the debris has little\neffect on the correlation relationship. In the case of clasts\nsmaller than the pixel size, the pixel values represent\naveraged values of light-dark contact areas. Therefore\nassociated semivariance and texture values are small, and\nthe debris, which is often larger than the pixel size, can\nsignificantly increase the total observed texture and semi-\nvariance values and therefore cause a size-dependent depar-\nture from linear behavior. Hence loss of quality can be\nexpected in areas where the particle size is significantly\nsmaller than the pixel size. The failure of grain size\nestimation from 10 cm resolution imagery can partially be\nattributed to pixel size versus particle size effects. In the\ngrain size map shown in Figure 5, only 4% of clasts (by\nsurface) were larger than 10 cm (i.e., 100 mm). However,\nwoody debris and small bushes frequently exceed 10 cm in\ndiameter. Therefore it should be expected that attempts at\ngrain size estimation from 10 cm resolution imagery may\nfail since most particles are smaller than the pixel size and\ndebris is frequently larger than the pixel size.\n5.2. Performance of Texture Versus Performance\nof Semivariance\n[31] After model validation, local image semivariance\ngives better results then local image texture and was selected\nas the best method for grain size mapping (Figure 5).\nDespite the fact that the local image texture model had a\ncomparable quality, image texture failed at the validation\nstage. The likely explanation for this is that image texture\nremains sensitive to illumination changes that can occur as a\nresult of changes in daylight or camera exposure times. The\nimages used for model calibration were taken consecutively,\nwhile those used for validation, scattered over 10 km, were\ntaken over a greater time span during which lighting con-\nditions could have changed slightly. These changes in\nillumination could potentially alter the predictive relation-\nship between texture and grain size and cause the failure of\nthe texture model at the validation stage. It is therefore\npossible that a better illumination correction procedure\nwould improve this situation. Another possible explanation\nfor the failure of the texture method lies in the resampling of\nthe colors in the original image. As stated previously, during\nthe calculation of the cooccurrence matrix, images were\nresampled to 32 gray levels in order to reduce processing\ntime to manageable levels. This resampling reduces the\ninformation content in the image by smoothing small differ-\nences in gray levels. Since image semivariance uses bright-\nness differences in the raw 8 bit gray level image, maximum\nimage information is preserved and the semivariance method\ncan be expected to be more sensitive to small changes in\ncolor patterns. Therefore semivariance was selected as the\nmethod used for gain size estimation.\n5.3. Grain Size Data Quality\n[32] The quality of the semivariance-based grain size\nestimations can be quantified from mean error estimates\nand their standard deviation. The mean error of \u00041.4%\nobtained during validation can be interpreted as a bias, and\nthe standard deviation of 15.4% can be interpreted as a\nprecision of \u00b115.4% for the method. This error is high\ncompared to field methods which can have precisions below\n\u00b110% [Bunte and Abt, 2001]. However, the automation of\nthe process and the surfaces that can be covered make this\nerror acceptable. Given that the validation data consisted of\nbulk samples and that the calibration data consisted in\nphotosieving grain size data, a bias was expected during\nvalidation. The obtained bias of \u00041.4% therefore seems to\nsupport the findings of Ibbeken and Schleyer [1986], who\nfound that the bias associated to photosieving was suffi-\nciently small to neglect correction factors. Furthermore, the\nsmall reported bias confirms field observations that clasts in\nthe study river are generally weakly imbricated.\n[33] The most likely sources of error affecting the model\ncalibration can be associated to lighting conditions. While\nthe semivariogram is not sensitive to lighting intensity\nsince it operates on absolute differences, it may be\nsensitive to changes in lighting direction. This may affect\nthe size of clast shadows and can therefore change both\nimage texture and semivariance. For this reason, imagery\nwas not collected in early morning or evening.\n5.4. Comparison to Other Methods of Grain\nSize Estimation From Airborne Images\n[34] With an R2 of 0.96, these results surpass those of\nVerdu\u00b4 et al. [2003]. The most likely explanation for this\nimproved performance is the use of two-dimensional semi-\nvariance as opposed to one-dimensional semivariance.\nImages are by definition two-dimensional. Therefore the\nuse of two-dimensional semivariance makes more efficient\nuse of the information content in the imagery and improves\nthe estimation of the sill value.\n5.5. Future Research\n[35] The first important aspect requiring further research\nis the measurement of grain sizes in submerged areas. The\nW07202 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: MAPPING GRAIN SIZE IN GRAVEL BED RIVERS\n9 of 11\nW07202\ndry bed areas typically represent a small fraction of the total\nriver channel area. The conventional solution to this prob-\nlem is to fly the airborne survey in periods of low flow.\nHowever, this solution still provides a partial view of the\nriverbed. Therefore a method to measure grain sizes within\nthe wetted perimeter from airborne imagery would be\nhighly useful. Examination of air photos taken in fluvial\nenvironments shows that for shallow areas, some texture is\nvisible on the riverbed. It is therefore possible that methods\nsimilar to those presented in this article could yield usable\nestimates of grain sizes for greater areas of the wetted\nperimeter. The major question that remains is the quality\nthat can be achieved since the presence of a water interface\nwill severely degrade image quality even if turbidity is low.\nIt can therefore be expected that the quality of the grain\nsizes estimates will be much lesser than those presented\nhere. However, even if of lesser quality, these estimates\ncould still be of use in many fields of research.\n[36] Further investigation is also required to assess the\nuniversality of the grain size mapping method presented\nhere. This two-dimensional semivariance-based D50 map-\nping method relies on image properties that exist in any\nimage, and therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that the\nmethod is transferable to other river systems. However,\nseveral issues need to be investigated. The effect of varying\nriver lithologies on the precision of the method and on the\ncalibration relationship for the empirical model should be\nstudied in order to demonstrate that the method is applicable\non any river. Additionally, a better understanding of the\neffect of the illumination angle during image collection on\nthe model calibration could potentially improve the result-\ning data quality.\n6. Conclusion\n[37] It has been demonstrated that reliable grain size\nestimations of the exposed dry bed areas of a river channel\ncan be obtained from digital airborne imagery, provided that\nimage resolution, sampling window size, and ground truth\ngrain size scale are adjusted with respect to particle size and\nuniform gravel patch scale following equations (3)\u2013(6). If\nproperly calibrated and adjusted, the methods presented in\nthis study allow for fully automated mapping of grain size\nwith an error of \u00b115.4% at a spatial resolution of 99 cm. Such\nmethods, combined with appropriate data management, will\ntherefore allow for studies and modeling of processes on a\nscale which has been difficult to work with in the past.\nNotation\nD distance separating two image pixels, in pixels.\n~d direction between two image pixels, degrees.\nP cooccurrence matrix, dimensionless.\nL number of rows and columns in the cooccurrence\nmatrix.\nI textural inertia, dimensionless.\ng semivariance, square of the units of the variable of\ninterest.\nZ spatial variable of interest used in semivariance\ncalculations, any unit.\n(M, N) image dimensions, in pixels.\np lag value in the x direction used in semivariance\ncalculations, in pixels.\nq lag values in the y direction used in semivariance\ncalculations, in pixels.\nW number of rows and columns in sampling window\nmethods.\nD50 median grain size, mm.\nSS Minimum widow size to achieve a stable semi-\nvariance sill plane.\nGP Size of a uniform gravel patch, cm.\nGT Size of the sampling area for ground truth data,\ncm.\nR Image resolution, cm.\n[38] Acknowledgments.
