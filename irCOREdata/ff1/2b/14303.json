As the Teaching and\nLearning Committee of the University of Western Australia observe in Alternative Modes\nof Teaching and Learning (1996, 2):\nThe new world that is emerging values flexibility over rigidity, and process over content.\nYet with our complex system of faculties and departments, courses and units, curricula\nand assessment, we offer students little control over their own learning. Our current\nmodel is predominantly didactic rather than negotiated, and we prefer to control\nlearning resources, rather than offer them. Our school system is already adapting, re-\nstructuring and adopting technology to make the curricula more relevant to individual\nlearners' characteristics, to make learning more active, and to empower students to take\n50\nALT-] Volume 6 Number I\nresponsibility for their own learning. Students will come to expect no less from their\ntertiary experiences.\nTeacher educators have been slow to realize the potential of technological change. Where\ncomputer-mediated delivery has been used to educate teachers, it has been mostly in the field\nof Continuing Teacher Education (CTE) and some universities now offer postgraduate\nteacher-education programmes via flexible delivery involving off-campus, computer-\nmediated delivery. In the area of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) there has been less\nexperimentation. Selinger (1996) describes an 18-month, part-time, distance-taught PGCE\noffered by the Open University for potential primary and secondary teachers who were\nunable to attend a full-time course. However, this programme was delivered mainly via the\ntraditional Open University print media packages, with the use of information technology in\nthis programme being restricted to synchronous\/asynchronous email for tutorial support and\ntext-based conferences. Otherwise, there has been little reported experimentation with\nflexible delivery in ITE programmes, and little or no work has been done which involves\ncomparing the efficacy of flexible delivery compared with traditional university teaching.\nIn recent years, partnership models, which involve students spending a greater proportion\nof their time in schools, have become fashionable with teacher educators. However, as with\ncomputer-mediated delivery, little is known about the efficacy of a partnership model when\ncompared with the traditional alternative. The study reported here aims to explore the\nefficacy of these two innovations with respect to the delivery of a courseware module for\nITE. The null hypotheses tested were: (1) that the efficacy of computer-mediated delivery\nof courseware is not different from that of traditional, university delivery methods, and\n(2) that the efficacy of learning in partnership with schools is not significantly different\nfrom university-based learning.\nMethods\nPreliminary inventory methods. Student teachers were randomly approached at the\nUniversity of Western Australia and asked to complete inventory forms. The sample of\nstudent teachers included male (N=14) as well as female (N=21) students. Inventory form\nquestions included one which asked students to indicate their gender and one which asked\nthose students with an email account to indicate the approximate number of times per\nweek they checked them.\nMain study sample. The sample comprised 43 student teachers of science, studying a\nlesson-planning courseware module as part of their Diploma in Education programme.\nScience was the major teaching area for 21 students who had studied a science to at least\nthe third year of their undergraduate programme. It was a minor teaching area for 22 of\nthe students who had studied a science to the second year of their undergraduate\nprogramme. Eighteen of the students were male and 25 female. All of the students studied\nthe same courseware designed to develop lesson planning skills, which comprised a lecture\nfollowed by a seminar.\nThe students were assigned to four treatment groups. The assignment was purposive with\nrespect to the level to which science had been studied successfully in the student's\nundergraduate programme and with respect to student gender, as it was thought that these\nvariables might also influence achievement.\n51\nBrian M.

The second group (N=12) received the lecture at university supplemented by a\nschool-based courseware package to be completed with the student's supervising teacher.\nThe third group (N=10) and the fourth group (N=10) were given training in using email\nand an Internet browser. For these groups, the courseware used by to the first two groups\nwas delivered via the Internet with electronic tutorial support provided by the university\nlecturer.\nMain study instruments. An instrument called the Science Lesson Plan Rating Instrument\n(SLPRI) was developed for the purpose of assessing lesson planning achievement. The\ncategories of the SLPRI are shown in Table 1.\nAppraisers using the instrument are required to judge the quality of the lesson plan against\na set of criteria. Using a dichotomous scoring key for each of the 34 criteria, a maximum\nscore of 34 points could be attained.\nMain study procedure. Six appraisers were selected for training in using the instrument.\nThese six appraisers were all science-education lecturers involved in initial teacher\neducation. After a day of intensive training in using the instrument, reliability trials were\ncarried out. Appraisers were required to assess three sample lesson plans provided; the\nthree appraisers with the closest agreement in assessing these lesson plans were selected to\nparticipate in the study.\nStudent teachers were pre-tested with respect to their lesson-planning skills by being asked\nto prepare a lesson on the differences between animal and plant cells. Students were then\nassigned to the four treatment groups and post-tested with respect to their lesson-planning\nskills by being asked to prepare a further lesson on the differences between animal and\nplant cells. To avoid experimenter-expectation effects (Barber, 1973), the roles of\ninvestigator and experimenter were separated and the investigator did not participate in\ndata collection. The lesson plans resulting from the pre-test and post-test were randomly\nassigned to appraisers to avoid systematic rating errors in the results.\nResults\nPreliminary inventory results. As shown in Table 2, preliminary inventory data revealed\nthat the mean number of times per week in which male student teachers used email\naccounts (5.14) was significantly higher than the mean number for female students (2.21).\nThe inventory data supported the consideration of gender as a factor within the\nexperimental design of the main study.\nMain study results. Students' post-test scores on the SLPRI were converted to percentages\nand subjected to a two-way analysis of co-variance, with the delivery strategy (traditional\nor computer-mediated) and the context (university-based or partnership) as factors, and\nthe pre-test scores as a co-variate. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nBoth of the null hypotheses were rejected. Students' achievement gains were higher when\ncomputer-mediated delivery strategies were employed when compared with traditional\nuniversity delivery methods (see Table 3). Also, achievement gains were higher when\n53\nBrian M. Sovo and Roger G.

Reasons for this greater efficacy require further study.\nClark (1994) asserts that media as well as media attributes fail to influence learning, and\nthat delivery media are not directly responsible for motivating learning. Schutte (1997)\nsuggests that the greater efficacy of computer-mediated communications relates to the\n54\nALT-] Vb\/ume 6 Number I\nenhanced levels of interaction among students. The National Council for Educational\nTechnology (NCET, 1996) suggests that advantages of computer-mediated delivery are\nenhanced peer-group interaction, opportunities for self-paced work and access to advice\nfrom peers, tutors and experts via the Internet on demand. Mason (1994) suggests that\ncomputer-mediated delivery can improve professional development and training by\nenhancing tutorial support, providing a forum for interaction between teachers and\nlearners, and a medium for mutual support for students, facilitating access to expert\ndebate.\nThe conclusion that achievement gains were higher when students worked in a partnership\narrangement with schools, rather than in a traditional university-based environment, is\nsignificant in that we were unable to locate other quantitative empirical studies which had\naddressed this issue. This finding is supportive of policies which involve student teachers\nspending more time in schools and undertaking more of their educational studies in a\nschool-based setting.\nAchievement gains were 36 per cent higher for the treatment group where computer-\nmediated delivery on a flexible learning basis was employed in a partnership context, when\ncompared with traditional delivery methods. This finding supports Attwood's (1994, 11)\nassertion that:\nIt is still early days in the development of formalized partnership models of teacher\neducation, and new initiatives are yet to be fully evaluated. At present IT needs special\nattention, mainly because of constraints on resources and staff expertise. However, all\nthe project reports indicated that where there was adequate staff support, a suitable\nresource base and a shared understanding of the appropriate use of IT in education,\nsupported through course and assessment requirements, IT in partnership worked well.\nSeparate ANOVAs were carried out for the entire sample on the two factors which were\ncontrolled in the experiment, namely the year-level to which science had been studied\nsuccessfully in the student's undergraduate programme, and the student's gender. The null\nhypothesis that the year-level to which science had been studied did not influence lesson-\nplanning achievement was rejected (F=5.53 on 1 degree of freedom, p=0.024), and this\nfinding confirms that subject-matter understanding is an important factor in determining\nlesson-planning achievement. However, there were no significant differences in achieve-\nment associated with student gender (F=0.03, p=0.86). This surprising finding suggests\nthat although male students may make greater use of information technology as supported\nby the preliminary data (see also, for example, Davidson, 1995), when required to do so,\nfemale students perform on a par with their male counterparts.\nReferences\nAttwood, G.
