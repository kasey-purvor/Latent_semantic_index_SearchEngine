INTRODUCTION \nOwing to their unique characteristics, lasers have the propensity to be employed for the non-\ncontact processing of materials which are otherwise difficult to process. Concrete is a \ncomposite material consisting of an array of fine and coarse aggregate pieces embedded \nwithin an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) matrix. Consequently the processing and surface \ntreatment of concrete can be an arduous task.  \nTo date, many studies have been carried out to investigate the laser processing of concrete. \nMost of the research, however, has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and \nreinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers, most prominently with regard to nuclear \nreactor decommissioning 1-3. Also, as part of nuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al 4-7 \nconducted research to determine the workability of several laser techniques for sealing\/fixing \nradioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces. Such techniques experimented with were: \ndirect glazing of the concrete, single and multiple layer fusion cladding and combined \nchemical\/fusion cladding. Work by Sugimoto et al 8 focused upon modifying the surface \nappearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. \nThe laser treatment produced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and appearance \nunique to laser treatment. The resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of \nthe post-process cement based materials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al 9. \nBorodina et al 10 has carried out investigations into the structural changes within the \ncomposition of zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing \nmicrostructural changes, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. In all of these \nstudies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity formation were found to be major \nproblems undermining the performance of the laser treated surface layer. \nThis present work is concerned with the utilisation of the relatively novel high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) to generate a surface glaze on the OPC surface layer of concrete, and the \neffects thereof on the OPC\u2019s mechanical, physical and chemical properties. The ultimate aim \nof this investigation is to facilitate the hitherto impossible task of generating a durable and \nlong-lasting surface seal on the concrete, thereby extending the life and applications base of \n 4 \nthe concrete. It is a distinct possibility that such a development may yield significant \neconomic benefits. \nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete. For the \npurpose of experimental convenience the as-received concrete blocks were sectioned into \nsquares (120 x 120 x 20mm) prior to laser treatment. The composition of the concrete by \nvolume is as follows: 20mm limestone aggregate (40%), 10mm limestone aggregate (14 %), \nzone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) and particulate fine aggregate (7%). \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810nm \u00b120nm \nand operating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The laser \nbeam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4m long, 600\u00b5m core diameter optical \nfibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis \nof a 3-axis CNC gantry table. The concrete sample blocks were irradiated using the \ndefocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam spot diameter of 2mm and laser powers \n(measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power meter) of 20-55 W. The defocused \nlaser beam was fired across the surfaces of the concrete samples by traversing the samples \nbeneath  the beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from                    \n60-600 mm\/min. The laser optics were protected by means of a coaxially blown shield gas jet \na rate of 5 l\/min. For comparison purposes both O2 and Ar were used. \nTo determine the characteristics of the glazes the HPDL treated concrete samples were \nexamined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse \nX-ray analysis (EDX) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, as well thermal analysis \ntechniques.  \n \n 5 \nIII. GENERAL EFFECTS OF HIGH POWER DIODE LASER INTERACTION \nWITH CONCRETE \nA. Effect of laser power density on melt depth and morphology \nVariations in the power density were seen to significantly affect the surface morphology and \nthe size of the region of laser melting on the OPC surface of the concrete. A series of \nexperiments were conducted with an O2 shield gas for a wide range of power densities, whilst \nthe traverse speed was fixed at 120, 300 and 480 mm\/min. Fig. 1 shows how the depth of the \nlaser melt region on the OPC surface of the concrete increases with increased power density \nfor the given traverse speeds.  \nIn the relatively low power density range (<0.75 kW\/cm), a minimum power density level of \naround 0.2 kW\/cm was required, below which no discernible effect of the laser treatment on \nthe OPC surface of the concrete could be seen, regardless of the traverse speed. A typical \nexample of a low power density laser interaction region is the top track shown in Fig. 2. As \none can see, laser interaction at this relatively low level resulted in only slight surface \ncharring. At relatively medium power densities (0.75-2.25 kW\/cm), however, the surface \ncondition of the OPC surface of the concrete after laser radiation had changed considerably. \nA typical example of a medium power density laser interaction region is the centre track \nshown in Fig. 2. Here a green coloured surface (which is discussed later) has been generated \nthat appears glazed. The surface undulates greatly, with the undulations being regular in both \nperiodicity and intensity. In addition, the surface displays very few microcracks and few \nporosities. The bottom track shown in Fig. 2 shows an example indicative of a relatively high \npower density range (2.25-3 kW\/cm) track. The effects in terms of surface condition are \nsimilar to those of the relatively medium power track. But, in contrast, the undulating surface \nis much more pronounced, whilst the surface is heavily pitted with many porosities and \ndisplays a large number of microcracks. \nB. Effect of traverse speed on melt depth and morphology \nAs with power density variations, traverse speed changes affected both the surface \nmorphology and the size of the region of laser interaction on the OPC surface of the concrete. \n 6 \nA series of experiments were conducted with an O2 shield gas for a wide range of traverse \nspeeds, whilst the power density was fixed at 1, 2 and 3 kW\/cm with a spot diameter of                 \n1mm. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the depth of the laser treatment on the OPC \nsurface of the concrete and the traverse speed for the stated power densities.  \nFrom the experiments it was observed that generally, as the traverse speed increased, the \ndepth of  the laser melt region decreased. Also, processing with traverse speeds less than            \n120 mm\/min and in excess of 480 mm\/min, resulted in the surface condition of the OPC \nsurface of the concrete after laser irradiation being extremely poor. As the tracks on the top \nand bottom of Fig. 4 show, the treated surfaces display many large porosities and a large \nnumber of microcracks. \nC. Mass loss\/regain during and after laser treatment \nAlthough material ejection was generally not a typical feature of HPDL beam interaction \nwith the OPC surface of the concrete, a loss in mass of the concrete was a possibility due to \nthe resulting heat effects of the process. In order to determine any weight loss experienced by \nthe concrete as a result of HPDL irradiation, a number of samples were stored in a controlled \nenvironment for two days prior to laser irradiation. The samples were weighed regularly to \nensure a constant mass. The samples were treated at various power densities and traverse \nspeeds and then immediately weighed. Fig. 5 shows the percentage loss of original mass \nexperienced by the concrete in terms of power density and traverse speed.  \nAs one can see from Fig. 5, the loss in mass experienced by the concrete increases almost \nproportionately in a linear manner with increasing power density up to approximately                \n2.1 kW\/cm. After this point the loss in mass can be seen to decrease in terms of the power \ndensity. It is reasonable to assume that this indicates that a level of power density saturation \nhas been attained, beyond which further increases in power density have a marginal effect on \nthe loss in mass of the concrete. In contrast, as the traverse speed is increased then the loss in \nmass experienced by the concrete decreases, again in a linear manner. \nAfter laser treatment the samples were stored in an uncontrolled environment (open \nlaboratory) and weighed regularly every day for 12 days. The results of these tests are \n 7 \nillustrated in Fig. 6, which shows clearly that the extent to which the concrete regains mass is \na function of the density of the energy deposited on its surface. This is perhaps not surprising \nsince an increase in the energy density increases the likelihood of material ejection or \nporosity formation. Also, as the energy incident upon the OPC surface of the concrete \nincreases, the HAZ will consequently increase in size. \nThe general mass regain experienced by the laser treated concrete at the various laser power \ndensities is thought to be the result of the rehydration through contact with the air of the \nHAZ, which is comprised of unslaked lime (as discussed later). This appears to be a \nreasonable assumption when one considers that in terms of absolute mass regain, the greatest \nmass regain occurs with the samples treated with the highest power density. For instance, the \nconcrete sample treated at a power density of 1 kW\/cm initially reduces in mass to 99.7% of \nits original mass, but after 12 days has regained 0.1% to be finally 99.8% of its original mass. \nIn contrast, the concrete sample treated at a power density of 3 kW\/cm initially reduces in \nmass to 98.4% of its original mass, but after 12 days has regained some 0.5% to be finally \n98.9% of its original mass. \nIV. THERMAL ANALYSIS \nA number of methods exist that can yield the thermal characteristics of concrete. Arguably \nthe two most effective are Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG) and Differential Thermal \nAnalysis (DTA), which are commonly performed simultaneously. From these techniques it is \npossible to observe the full range of reactions which occur in the OPC surface of the concrete \nfrom ambient temperature up to, and including, the melting temperature. TG-DTA of \nconcrete has been carried out and explained fully by a number of workers 11-13. Table I details \nthe summary results of these analyses.  \n \n \n \n 8 \nA. The effects of increasing temperature \n1. Effect on water held in cement paste \nWater is present within concrete in three forms 14: (i) Combined Water - water which is \ncombined in the hydrated cement compounds and as such is part of the solid, (ii) Gel Water - \nadsorbed water which is held by surface forces on the gel particles and (iii) Capillary Water - \nfree water which is present in the pores beyond the range of the surface forces of the solids in \nthe cement paste. In practice, these divisions are somewhat arbitrary, as low levels of heating \ncan result in the loss of combined water, whilst some gel and capillary water remains. \nNonetheless, the divisions serve to outline the general behaviour of the first stages of heating \nduring the HPDL treatment of the OPC surface of the concrete as detailed in Table I- Region \nI.    \nThe first effect of the heat generated by laser interaction with the OPC surface of the concrete \nis to weaken the bonds of the bound water layers, causing a reduction in strength. The loss in \nstrength is regained above 1200C as the OPC surface of the concrete begins to dry out, \nresulting in densification and an increase in the van der Wall\u2019s forces as the cement gel layers \nmove closer together 15. This is due to the evaporation of capillary water from large pores \nnear to the surface of the OPC at temperatures between 30 and 1200C 12.  \nAs the temperature increases, so does the rate of evaporation due to the loss of the more \ntightly bound gel and chemically-bound waters 15. As the chemically-bound water is released \nthe gel begins to break down, occasioning an increase in porosity and microcracking. \nConsequently, there is a rapid loss in strength above 3000C 12. The dehydration of ettringite \noccurs between 100 and 1500C. With the application of sufficient heat the ettringite may \nultimately be converted to CaO and Al2O3. Again, this will lead to a loss in strength. \n2. Dehydration of Ca(OH)2 \nDTA results show that up to approximately 4200C the concrete remains relatively stable 11, 12. \nSome dehydration occurs, however, and water is also lost from the pores of the cement. But, \nas one can see from Table I- Region II, this effect is far outweighed by the dehydration of \nCa(OH)2 which follows shortly after 420\n0C is exceeded in accordance with \n 9 \n   Ca(OH)2\u2192CaO+H2O (1) \nAdditionally, the dehydration of the Ca(OH)2 promotes the development of microcracks \nwhich begin initially around the Ca(OH)2 \n12. Moreover, this dehydration results in unslaked \nlime (CaO) which is effectively the HAZ. This CaO is either located below the glazed surface \nlayer or around the edges of the glaze. Indeed, by using a phenolphthalein indicator followed \nby water misting, it was possible to clearly discern the HAZ around the laser treated zone on \nthe OPC surface of the concrete, since phenolphthalein is an indicator which is colourless in \nCaO, turning violet-red in the presence of Ca(OH)2 due to the change in pH. \nV. MECHANICAL, CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES \nCurrent British and international standards in relation to concrete, are concerned only with \nwater sorptivity and compressive strength. Consequently, it was not possible to test the \nHPDL generated glazes according to, and strictly adhering to, established tests. As such, \nwherever possible tests based on current standards were developed to investigate specific \naspects of particular relevance to the HPDL generated glazes; namely the pull-off strength, \nthe surface roughness, the rupture strength, the wear resistance and the corrosion resistance.  \nA. Pull-off strength \nIn order to ascertain the strength of the bond between the HPDL generated surface glaze on \nthe OPC and the concrete substrate itself, pull-off tests were conducted. For the tests the \nconcrete was prepared as relatively small area samples (25mm x 25mm). High tensile \naluminium test dollies were then attached onto the glazed surface and to the axially opposite \nconcrete substrate surface using Araldite epoxy and left to cure for 24 hours. In order to \nensure axial accuracy (essential for true results), the test dollies were set in position using \nidentical V-blocks. The samples were placed into an Instron 4507 tensile\/compressive test rig \nby mounting the test dollies into the jaws of the rig. A tensile force was then applied until \nfailure with the energy being simultaneously recorded. \nThe results obtained varied markedly with changes in the laser operating parameters, as               \nFig. 7 shows. A post-test analysis of the samples showed that the material failed \n 10 \napproximately below the laser treated surface in the HAZ. Within the optimum laser \noperating parameters the average bond strength of the glaze was recorded as 24 MPa. This \ncompares with 63 MPa for the untreated OPC surface of concrete.  \nB. Rupture strength \nTests were conducted to determine the rupture strength of the OPC glaze. Test samples were \nprepared as described above. The samples were placed onto the sample stage of the Instron \n4507 tensile\/compressive test rig and then subjected to a compressive rupture force until the \nOPC glaze failed (cracked), with the energy being simultaneously recorded. The rupture force \nwas applied by means of a high tensile steel indentor with a 1mm radius point. The results of \nthe tests revealed that the average rupture strength of the OPC glaze was only 0.8 J, whilst the \nrupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was some 4.3 J.  \nC. Water sorptivity testing \nIn order to test the water sorption properties of the OPC glaze, or in other words, the effect of \nthe OPC glaze on the water absorption characteristics of the concrete, comparison \nexperiments with the untreated OPC surface were conducted by measuring the water \nsorptivity. For the experiment the HPDL treated and untreated OPC samples were cut into \nsmaller pieces (25 x 25mm). The tests were conducted in accordance with the standard \nprocedure as used by Hall et al 16. The samples were dried to a constant weight in an air oven \nat 650C to ensure all pores were free of water. The OPC laser glaze and the untreated OPC \nsurfaces were then immersed in water and weighed at regular intervals. The side faces of the \ntwo samples were shielded from the water by means of an Araldite coating. In order to \ndetermine the sorptivity of the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC surface, i was plotted \nagainst the square root of time so as to give a straight line, as shown in Fig. 8. i is defined as \n   i\nm\nA\n=\n\u2206 .1000\n (2) \nwhere \u2206m is the cumulative change in mass with time and A is the absorbing surface area. \nThe sorptivity, S, the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC surface is simply the gradient of this \nline.  \n 11 \nAs is evident from Fig. 8, the sorptivity of the untreated OPC surface was a typical                \n0.096 mm\/min1\/2, compared with 0.043 mm\/min1\/2 for the laser glazed OPC surface. Thus it is \nreasonable to conclude that since the laser glazed OPC surface has half the sorption of the \nuntreated OPC surface, then the OPC laser glaze afforded the concrete twice as much \nresistance to water absorption than the untreated OPC surface. In addition, because the best-\nfit straight line for the laser glazed OPC surface is below that of the untreated OPC surface, \nas well as intercepting the axis at a point below the untreated OPC surface, then it can be \nconcluded that rate of absorption is of the laser surface glazed concrete is much less that of \nthe untreated concrete. Furthermore, it is a distinct possibility that the HAZ, which was \nidentified as CaO resulting from the dehydration of the Ca(OH)2, may, once re-hydrated, act \nas a barrier towards liquids such as water, therefore augmenting the resistance of the laser \nglazed OPC surface to water absorption. \nD. Wear life characteristics \nThe wear resistance of a material in general is determined primarily by the hardness of                 \nthe material in comparison with the hardness of other materials with which it comes into \ncontact 17. However, wear resistance does not always increase with hardness 18. Tests were \ntherefore conducted in accordance with Lawrence et al 19 to determine the exact difference in \nwear resistance characteristics of the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC surface. For \nexperimental purposes the OPC was cut into smaller pieces (25 x 25mm). Half of the samples \nwere then laser treated. All the samples were then weighed and subjected to a friction force \nfor 8 hours, being removed from the machine and weighed at two hourly intervals. \nFig. 9 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the OPC glaze and \nthe untreated OPC. As one can see, the wear resistance of the OPC glaze is fractionally \ngreater than that of the untreated OPC. However, the OPC glaze shows a significant increase \nin wear resistance over the untreated OPC surface, with the weight loss being 2 times lower \nafter 4 hours, and 3 times lower after 8 hours. \n \nE. Corrosion resistance \n 12 \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal \nservice environment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore corrosion resistance \ntests based upon BS 6431 20 were conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and Premier \nProducts MP9 detergent cleaner. The experiments were carried out by dropping small \namounts of the corrosive agents in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% \non to the surface of the untreated and HPDL glazed OPC surface of concrete at hourly \nintervals for four hours. The samples were then examined optically and mechanically tested \nin terms of compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of the various corrosive \nagents were used principally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% nitric acid is \nused within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels 21.  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately \nattack the untreated OPC surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with \ngreater severity than the detergent, whilst the HPDL glazed surface displayed no discernible \nmicrostructural changes or signs of devitrification due to corrosion.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 22 revealed that exposure of the untreated OPC \nsurface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear \nresistance of the OPC. As Fig. 10 shows, exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and sodium \nhydroxide in the concentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength \nof approximately 19-37%. In the case of the detergent a discernible loss in compressive \nstrength only occurred with concentrations above 40%. Here the average loss in compressive \nstrength for concentrations in the range 60-80% was approximately 17%. This compares with \nno discernible difference in either the wear resistance or the compressive strength of the \nHPDL glazed surface. \nFig. 11 shows the variation in wear resistance of the untreated OPC surface when exposed to \nthe reagents with an 80% concentration. As one can see, the wear resistance is significantly \naffected, particularly through interaction with the nitric acid and the sodium hydroxide. Here \nthe weight loss was approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed OPC after 4 hours, \nand approximately 11 times higher after 8 hours for the nitric acid. In the case of the \ndetergent the weight loss was marginal after both 4 and 8 hours. \n 13 \nF. Wear life characteristics \nAs the results of the mechanical and chemical tests show, the OPC glaze out performed the \nuntreated OPC surface in almost all the test areas. Moreover, the generally superior \nmechanical and chemical performance of the OPC glaze over untreated OPC suggests that the \nlife characteristics of the OPC glaze may also superior to those of untreated OPC. This was \nespecially true in the case of chemical resistance and water permeability, where the OPC \nglaze proved to be resistant to both. This marked variation in corrosion resistance and \npermeability performance is due to the difference in structure of the OPC glaze and the \nuntreated OPC. Whereas the OPC glaze is of an amorphous nature, the untreated OPC is \ncomprised of a porous polycrystalline structure, thus the untreated OPC is readily attacked  \nby acids whilst the amorphous structure of the OPC glaze ensure an increase in acid \nresistance 23. However, in any analysis of the wear life of the two materials the in-situ relative \nthickness of the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC layer on concrete must be considered in \norder to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics, particularly when \nconsidering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). \nConsequently the increase in wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nOPC laser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (3) \nwhere, Wear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg.cm .cm)\nWear rate (mg.cm .h )\n-3\n-2 -1\n (3a) \nTable II summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the OPC glaze over \nthe untreated OPC surface. As Table II shows, the OPC glaze gives an increase in actual life \nover the untreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. However, as one can see, the \nincrease in actual life of the OPC glaze over the untreated OPC surface varies considerably \ndepending upon the working environment. But, notwithstanding this, arguably the most \ncommon working environment for an OPC surface would involve some contact with at least  \ndetergent acids, therefore yielding significant economic savings since a HPDL glazed OPC \nsurface lasts around 2.5-times longer than one which is unglazed. \n 14 \nVI. DISCUSSION \nA. Glaze formation mechanism  \nThe complex chemistry of the OPC surface of the concrete and the hydration of its various \nconstituents are not yet fully resolved 24. Notwithstanding this, it is known that the \nconstituents of OPC are minerals which exist as multi-component solid solution chemical \ncompounds. Of particular importance with regards this study, OPC contains in relatively \nlarge proportions: SiO2 (21wt%), Al2O3 (5wt%) and Fe2O3 (3wt%), which are basic glass \nnetwork formers and modifiers. Consequently the intense local heating brought about by the \nincident HPDL beam results in melting of these compounds at around 12830C, thereby \ncausing the materials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous glassy material \nconsisting of various calcium-silicate-alumina compounds 4. Indeed, the amorphous nature of \nthis glaze is verified by the XRD analysis results given in Fig. 12.  \nAs was mentioned earlier, HPDL interaction with the OPC surface occasioned a dramatic \ncolour change; changing from grey to green. These changes are due to the resultant phase \ntransitions and also, the presence in small concentrations of metal transition ions in various \noxidation states within the OPC composition, in particular, ferric ions in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ \noxidation state. Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions are known to give rise to green and blue colours \nrespectively when subjected to intense heating 25, 26. However, if both phases are present \nwithin the composition, then the colour is determined by the Fe3+\/Fe2+ ion ratio, resulting in \ndark blue or black colours 25, 26. Since the surface produced after HPDL treatment was green, \nthen it is reasonable to assume that both phases were not present within the OPC. \n1. Cracking and the formation mechanism \nAs Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show, cracking of the HPDL induced glaze occurred to various degrees. \nThe formation of cracks can be attributed mainly to thermal stresses generated during HPDL \nirradiation. This is due to the fact that OPC has low thermal conductivity, and, as such, \nduring laser heating a large thermal gradient between the melt zone and the substrate exists \nwhich results in the generation of thermal stresses. Additionally, despite the fact that the \nHPDL surface treatment process is effectively localised in nature, the fact remains that a \n 15 \ncertain amount of the heat generated will be conducted to sections of the OPC where the \nsurface is already glazed. This, combined with existence of a relatively cold OPC substrate \nmeans that thermal stresses will be generated. During the heating phase the stresses will be \ncompressive and relieved by plastic deformation, thus precluding crack formation. At high \ntemperatures (T\u2265Tm) the stresses can also be relieved \n27-29. However, during cooling when the \ntemperature falls below Tm, then stresses will accumulate. If the fracture strength of the \nmaterial is exceeded, then cracking within the melted layer will occur. The thermal stress \u03c3, \ninduced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation:  \n  \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (4) \nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u2206T is the temperature change, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal \nexpansion and \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. More succinctly, \u2206T is the difference between the critical \ntemperature (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and ambient temperature. For \nOPC this is the difference between the melting point, 12830C and ambient temperature 200C. \nSo, if it is assumed that the glass formed on the surface of the OPC is similar to soda-lime-\nsilica glass because the compositions of the two materials are similar, then by using the \nfollowing values for pyrex: E=6.42 x 104 MN\/m, \u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1, \u2206T=12630C and \u03bd=0.176, \nwhen the OPC surface of the concrete was irradiated by the HPDL beam the thermal stress \nproduced in the resulting glass according to Equation (4) was around 305 MN\/m. Since this is \nwell in excess of the fracture strength of the glass, 120 MN\/m 30, cracking will occur, and can \nonly be avoided by severe distortion or through the reduction of \u2206T by pre-heating.  \nAs one can see from Fig. 13, under the extreme laser processing conditions of relatively high \npower density (3.25 kW\/cm) and slow traverse speed (120 mm\/min) with an Ar shroud gas, \nmicrocracking within the OPC glaze occurred both parallel and perpendicular to the surface. \nSuch findings are in accord with the nature of the tensile stresses produced during cooling of \nthe solidifying layer in terms of the glazed layer section thickness. During cooling of a \nrelatively thin glazed layer, the temperature is almost uniform across the section, therefore it \nonly experiences a two-dimensional stress at the surface. However, for relatively thick \nsection glazes, as is the case in question, the temperature gradient across the depth is present \n 16 \nalong with the gradients at the surface. Consequently the three-dimensional nature of the \nstresses produces microcracks that are both perpendicular and parallel to the surface 29, 31. \n2. Porosities and the formation mechanism \nFrom Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 it can be seen that porosities were a common feature of the HPDL \ninduced glaze, varying in size from microscopic pits to large craters depending upon the laser \noperating parameters. For all instances of porosity formation the mechanism behind their \ndevelopment is the consequence of gas escaping from within the melt and disrupting the \nsurface 32. With regard to the OPC glaze, the gas is likely to be CO2 \n9. If the laser energy \ndensity incident on the OPC is too low, then the generated CO2 can not escape from the \nmolten OPC surface easily because of the high viscosity of the melt. As such, when the CO2 \neventually does penetrate the melt surface, the resultant porosity is not filled by the flow               \nof the melt; since the insufficient energy density is unable to maintain a high                        \nenough temperature for an adequate length of time and thus decrease the overall viscosity of \nthe melt 31. In this case the porosities formed are typically small and shallow, being regular in \nboth periodicity and intensity (Fig. 14 (a)). On the other hand, if the laser energy density \nincident on the OPC surface of the concrete is too high, then boiling of the surface may \nhappen. At the same time an increase in CO2 formation may occur within the melt. These \nindividual pockets of CO2 formation may combine and rise to surface of the melt. Once the \nenergy density decreases (as the laser traverses away), then the additional CO2 will attempt to \nescape from the molten surface. However, as Fig. 14 shows schematically, the solidifying \nmelt will prevent this, causing bubbles to form (a). The excessive CO2 gas pressure will \nfirstly cause the bubbles to expand (b) and ultimately rupture the walls of the bubbles (c), \ncreating a sharp \u2018knife edge\u2019 porosity 3, 9. These types of porosity are usually large, deep and \nrandomly spaced. \n \n3. Shroud gas effects \nBecause of its open structure, it is possible for gases to dissolve molecularly in glass, and,              \nif the gas molecule is small enough, it can diffuse rapidly in a simple glass such as fused \n 17 \nsilica 30. Indeed, gases such as H2 and O2 are known to dissolve molecularly in glass and can \nalso react with the glass network 30. The quality of the glazes produced, in terms of porosity \nand microcracks, was greatly influenced by the type of shroud gas employed. When using \nboth Ar and O2 shroud gases the surfaces appeared undulated and displayed porosities. \nHowever, the crack density in the Ar shroud gas sample was found to be higher than that of \nthe sample treated with an O2 shield gas. \nThe use of O2 as the shroud gas significantly reduced the number of microcracks and \nporosities within the OPC glaze. This indicates that the O2 interacted with the glass network \nincreasing the heat generation and subsequently the fluidity of the melt. In contrast, the Ar \ndid not interact with the glass network and was consequently trapped within the more viscous \nmelt in the form of bubbles. As such, when employing O2, inherent gas bubbles generated \nduring vitrification of the OPC escaped from the melt more readily due to its lower viscosity, \nthus reducing the number of porosities. In addition, as the cooling curves for the HPDL \ntreated OPC surface of the concrete shown in Fig. 15 indicate, when the laser beam had been \nremoved, the cooling of the OPC was faster when an Ar shroud gas as opposed to an O2 \nshroud gas was employed. Therefore, the length of time that the OPC surface of the concrete \nis of a sufficient fluidity to allow the generated gas bubbles to escape the surface easily is \nmuch reduced, resulting in porosities and microcracks. \nB. Stability to devitrification \nDespite the fact that HPDL interaction with the OPC surface of the concrete generates an \namorphous glaze, it is possible for the OPC glaze to become crystalline through the \ndestruction of the glassy state by means of a process known as devitrification. This can occur \nas either the breakdown of the glass surface by corrosion or weathering, or as a result of the \noverall composition remaining unchanged while the crystals separate in the glassy medium, \ntherefore destroying the glassy state. This process being entirely dependant upon the \ntemperature and composition of the glass.  \nA high magnification SEM examination of the OPC glaze revealed no evidence of \ndevitrification was observed within the OPC glaze. This indicates that exposure of the OPC \n 18 \nglaze to the extremely harsh reagents detailed previously did not cause the glaze to devitrify. \nNor did the glass devitrify as a result of favourable high temperatures and glass composition. \nThis is of great significance since devitrification in this manner is the result of the movement \nof atoms to allow orientation and the presence of crystallisation centres. Such centres occur \nusually at the glass\/air boundary, around a porosity 17. Clearly, as Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show, \nporosities were in general a common feature of the OPC glaze. Furthermore, it is highly \nlikely that the composition of the OPC glaze also played an important part in the stability to \ndevitrification of the glaze. In particular it is known that compounds such as Al2O3 and MgO \n(which an EDX analysis showed were present in abundance in the OPC glaze) are known to \nbe very useful in assuaging devitrification problems 17. This is because the inclusion of such \ncompounds within the OPC glaze composition creates an glaze without a high liquidus \ntemperature and therefore a reduced tendency towards devitrification 17.  \nVII. CONCLUSIONS \nUsing a 60 W-cw high power diode laser (HPDL), glazing of the ordinary Portland cement \n(OPC) surface of concrete was successfully demonstrated with power densities as low as           \n750 W\/cm and at rates up to 480 mm\/min. \nThermal analysis techniques were used to identify the degradation reactions and the \ntemperatures at which they occur. In particular, the dehydration of Ca(OH)2 in the cement \nmatrix was ascertained as forming the heat affected zone (HAZ). Cracks and porosities were \ncommon features of the laser glaze. Cracking was identified as being due to the generation of \nthermal stresses in excess of the fracture strength of the glaze. Porosities are believed to be \nthe result of CO2 formation which ruptures the molten surface as it forms bubbles in an \nattempt to escape into the atmosphere.  \nThe use of an O2 shroud gas, as opposed to Ar, significantly reduced the number of \nmicrocracks and porosities within the OPC glaze. This is believed to be due to O2 interacting \nwith the glass network and thus increasing the heat generation and subsequently the fluidity \nof the melt. In contrast, the Ar did not interact with the glass network and was consequently \ntrapped within the more viscous melt in the form of bubbles. As such, when employing O2, \n 19 \ninherent gas bubbles generated during the laser vitrification of the OPC escaped from the \nmelt more readily due to its lower viscosity, thus reducing the number of porosities and \nmicrocracks. \nLife assessment testing revealed that the OPC glaze had an increase in wear life of 1.3 to 14.8 \ntimes over an untreated OPC surface, depending upon the corrosive environment. Mechanical \ntesting of the seals revealed that the average rupture strength of the OPC glaze was only 0.8 J, \nwhilst the rupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was some 4.3 J. The average bond \nstrength of the glaze was recorded as 24 MPa. This compares with 63 MPa for the untreated \nsurface of the OPC. Clearly, the economic and material benefits to be gained from the \ndeployment of such an effective and efficient coating on OPC could be significant. \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \n1. K.
