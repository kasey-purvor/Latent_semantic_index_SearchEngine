The upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere,\nor ionospheric D region, is an atmospheric layer which is\ndifficult to access experimentally. A useful method that also\nhas a large potential for further studies is artificial heating\nof electrons by means of powerful radio transmitters. Here\nwe estimate the effect of D-region heating for a few typi-\ncal cases of high electron density \u2212 daylight, typical auroral\nelectron precipitation, and a solar proton event\u2212 by coupling\na model of RF electron heating to the Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion Chem-\nistry (SIC) model. The predicted effects are among others\nan increase in the ratio of the concentration of negative ions\nto that of free electrons, and an increase in the absorption of\ncosmic noise as measured by riometers. For the model runs\npresented in this paper we have calculated the absorption for\nthe frequency (38.2 MHz) of the IRIS imaging riometer in\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland, as observing the ionosphere above the\nEISCAT Heater in Troms\u00f8, Norway. The predicted enhance-\nments of the absorption are 0.2\u20130.8 dB, an effect which is\nclearly detectable.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Active experiments; Ion chemistry\nand composition; Wave propagation)\n1 Introduction\nArtificial heating of ionospheric free electrons by means of\npowerful HF transmitters is a well established experimental\nmethod. Elevated electron temperatures give rise to several\neffects, such as perturbations of the electron density and an\nenhanced formation rate of negative ions which is important\nin the D region. Incoherent scatter radars (ISRs), riometers\nand optical instruments are applied for remote sensing of the\neffects. Stubbe (1996) has reviewed many of the experiments\nundertaken with the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific\nAssociation (EISCAT) Heater, which is collocated with the\nCorrespondence to: C.-F. Enell\n(carl-fredrik.enell@sgo.fi)\nUHF and VHF ISR transmitters close to Troms\u00f8 in Norway\nand thus a unique facility of its kind.\nMany recent experiments with the EISCAT heater have fo-\ncused on radio-induced optical emissions from the F region\n(Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999; Kosch et al., 2002a,b). In these ap-\nplications, the system is configured to transmit in the o-mode\ncircular polarisation, in order to avoid losses by D-region ab-\nsorption. On the other hand, transmitting in the x-mode dur-\ning adequate background conditions (daytime and\/or strong\nparticle precipitation), the experiments can be optimised for\nD-region studies.\nThere are, in fact, several classes of such dedicated D-\nregion experiments. Artificial Periodic Irregularities (API)\nis a combined heating and diagnostic radar experiment (Be-\nlikovich et al., 1986), which has been successfully demon-\nstrated with the EISCAT heater (Rietveld et al., 1996). A\npower-stepping D-region heating experiment, combined with\nISR observations, gives another interesting possibility to\nstudy the negative ion region (Mathews and Bekeny, 1978;\nTurunen, 1996) but this has not yet been experimentally\ntested. Other experiments involving D-region effects include\nthe generation of extremely low frequency (ELF) pulsations\n(Pashin et al., 1995) and modulation of polar mesospheric\nsummer echoes (Chilson et al., 2000). The latter is a pro-\ncess involving attachment of electrons to aerosols and thus\nsomewhat similar to the negative ion related experiments\nsuggested here.\nThe modulation of riometer absorption during heating ex-\nperiments under different conditions of energetic particle\nprecipitation has been estimated by Pashin et al. (2003),\nwhose results, i.e. an increase by 0.2\u20130.5 dB of the cosmic\nnoise absorption at 38.2 MHz, agree well with the results of\nthis work. Minami et al. (1999) have possibly detected this\neffect experimentally, but do not state any quantitative re-\nsults, except for the altitude of maximal heater wave absorp-\ntion.\n1576 C.-F.

The latter\nhas not been feasible until rather recently, due to the com-\nputer power needed for model implementations. Many mod-\nels, such as the widely used 2-D UBAIM model (Kazil et al.,\n2003), do not include coupling of neutral and ion reactions.\nOur approach, on the other hand, is to run a comprehensive\nmodel of ion-neutral reactions, using a simple numerical ap-\nproach and restricting ourselves to one dimension.\nThe Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion Chemistry model (SIC) was originally\ndeveloped as a steady-state box model of ion-ion reactions\n(Turunen et al., 1996). Later, SIC was extended into a 1-D\nmodel of coupled ion and neutral reactions. Detailed descrip-\ntions of changes and additions have been published by Ver-\nronen (2001) and Verronen et al. (2002). We therefore only\nbriefly summarise the most important features of the current\nversion of SIC here.\nThe current version of SIC models up to 36 positive and\n29 negative atomic, molecular and cluster ions, as well as up\nto 13 neutral components, in the altitude range 20\u2013150 km.\nThe remaining neutral components have fixed concentrations\ngiven by the MSISE-90 model (Hedin, 1991) and tables\nin Shimazaki (1984). Normally, SIC is forwarded in inter-\nvals of 5 to 15 min, using a reaction matrix, where the rates\nof nearly 400 reactions are taken into account. Vertical trans-\nport of neutral species is calculated between the intervals,\nexcept for O(1D) and N(2D), due to the fact that their chem-\nical lifetimes are much shorter than the transport time scale.\nThe one-dimensional approach of SIC is fully sufficient for\nthe present study of local heating effects, since an air parcel\ncannot be heated for a time interval longer than its traversal\nof the heater beam.\nThe D-region mean free path is sufficiently short so as to\njustify the assumption that ion, electron and neutral tempera-\ntures are equal during undisturbed conditions, i.e. whenever\nthe heater is off. For the present study, however, the elec-\ntron temperature Te must be separated from the ion\/neutral\ntemperature T when calculating the reaction rates of electron\nattachment and ion-electron recombination, since these will\nbe affected by the heating. The reaction rate coefficients af-\nfected by this separation are listed in Table 1. We assume that\nthe use of these same reaction rate coefficients is justifiable\nsince the electron temperature will not deviate from the neu-\ntral temperature by more than one order of magnitude (see\nRees, 1989). During the subsequent SIC runs, the electron\ntemperature was either set equal to the neutral temperature\n(henceforth referred to as \u201cbackground runs\u201d) or calculated\nby the electron heating model described in Sect. 3.1 (\u201cheat-\ning runs\u201d).\nAssuming overall neutrality, we can calculate the electron\ndensity from the model results as\nNe = Np \u2212Nn, (1)\nwhere Np and Nn are the total concentrations of positive\nand negative ions, respectively.\n3 Estimating the effects of RF heating\n3.1 The electron heating model\nThe electron temperature is calculated by a parallel-layer\nmodel described by Kero et al. (2000). The principle follows\nBelova et al. (1995) and is shown schematically in Fig. 1. For\neach model layer i, the dissipation Qi of radio wave energy\nby electron heating is calculated from the imaginary part of\nthe refractive index n according to\nQ = \u22122\u03c9H Im (n) Ii + Irefl\nc\n[Wm\u22123], (2)\nwhere \u03c9H is the angular frequency of the heater wave, Ii and\nIrefl are the incident and reflected irradiances at layer i, and\nthe complex refractive index n is calculated by the Appleton-\nLassen equation for a given electron density and magnetic\nfield. The incident irradiance I0 at the bottom layer at alti-\ntude h0 (altitudes are for a given SIC model run, i.e. at a\nmaximum 20\u2013150 km in 1-km steps) is assumed to be the\neffective radiated power (ERP) of the transmitter divided by\nC.-F. Enell et al.: Heating effects on riometer absorption 1577\nFig. 1. The layer model of electron heating. For each layer the dissi-\npation of RF energy is calculated by the Appleton-Lassen equation.\nReflection at layer boundaries is also included in the present version\nof the heating model, although this effect is generally very small. A\nlayer spacing of 1 km is used, as this is the resolution of the required\ninput profiles produced by the SIC model (electron and atomic oxy-\ngen density) and the MSISE-90 atmosphere (neutral temperature,\nN2 and O2 profiles).\n4pih20 (no absorption below the model altitudes) and the re-\nflected irradiance is the sum of the reflections at layer bound-\naries:\nIrefl,i = Ii\n(\nRe (ni+1 \u2212 ni)\nRe (ni+1 + ni)\n)2\n[Wm\u22122], (3)\naccording to the Fresnel relations. As Fig. 1 suggests, the\nupward and downward irradiances should, in principle, be\nsummed over an infinite number of reflections. Since the\nreflection is generally very small, only two iterations are used\nhere.\nThe equilibrium electron temperature profile is calculated\nby equating the RF energy dissipation Qi to the losses\nin electron collisions with N2, O2 (elastic collisions, rota-\ntional excitation and vibrational excitation) and with atomic\noxygen (elastic collisions, electronic excitation and fine-\nstructure transitions) as a function of temperature. Expres-\nsions given in Banks and Kockarts (1973) are used to pa-\nrameterise the temperature dependence of these collisional\nlosses.\n3.2 Riometer absorption calculation\nThe estimate of riometer absorption L for a given electron\ndensity profile is also based on the relations of electron-\nneutral collision losses given in the work by Banks and\n45\no\nHeater Riometer\nFig. 2. The geometry of the riometer absorption calculation. An\nangle of 45\u25e6 between the heater and riometer beams is assumed,\ncorresponding approximately to beam 9 of the IRIS riometer in\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi. We assume a perfect overlap.\nKockarts (1973). Using a formalism according to Sen and\nWyller (1960) we calculate the differential absorption dL\/dh\n[dB\/km] of each model layer as a function of:\n\u2013 The effective frequency \u03bde of electron collisions with\nN2, O2, O, H and He at a given temperature;\n\u2013 The riometer angular frequency \u03c9rio ;\n\u2013 The electron gyrofrequency \u03c9h at altitude h and latitude\n\u03c6, i.e.\n\u03c9h=2pi \u00b78.8\u00b7105\n\u221a\n4 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03c6\n(\nRearth\nRearth+h\n)3\n[s\u22121];\nusing the pure dipole approximation of the magnetic\nfield (which is used in the heating model as part of the\nAppleton-Lassen equation, as well).\nTo take into account the geometry of the riometer beam,\nthe differential absorption dL\/dh is multiplied by the so-\ncalled effective obliquity factor, a function of the riometer\nbeam width and zenith angle (Hargreaves and Detrick, 2002).\nAll absorption estimates henceforth will be calculated for a\ngeometry similar to beam 9 of the IRIS imaging riometer\n(Browne et al., 1995) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (69\u25e6 N, 21\u25e6 E) in north-\nern Finland, which overlaps the heater volume in the entire\naltitude range of interest. The calculated effective obliquity\nfactor of this beam is close to 1.42 at all altitudes, which\nmeans that we can simply apply the factor\n\u221a\n2 expected for\nan infinitely narrow beam tilted by 45\u25e6, as shown in Fig. 2.\nIRIS operates at a frequency of 38.2 MHz, which is therefore\nused in the calculations.\n1578 C.-F.

Due to the relatively low electron\ndensity below 100 km, the absolute effect is small, whereas\nthe electron temperature perturbation is very large, approx-\nimately 2500 K, at its maximum around 80 km. This gives\nrise to an estimated increase in riometer absorption of 0.2\u2013\n0.3 dB. The total absorption was calculated by summing the\ndifferential absorption over the entire altitude range.\nIn the second scenario (Fig. 4), the ionisation by electron\nprecipitation was switched on for the entire 1.5-h model run.\nThis produces a significantly larger electron density between\n70 and 100 km. The maximum absorption of the heater wave,\ntherefore, takes place at a lower altitude and the temperature\nincrease is smaller, but the higher electron density causes a\nhigher riometer absorption \u2212 the total absorption as summed\nover all altitudes being 1\u20131.5 dB \u2212 with a modelled increase\nof up to 0.8 dB during the heating period.\nFinally, scenario 3 repeats the same calculations with pro-\nton precipitation according to the GOES measurements from\n12:30 UT on 29 October 2003 (Fig. 5). The model does not\ninclude any rigidity effect (proton energy cutoff due to in-\nteraction with the magnetic field), so the estimate is a worst\ncase, as seen in the high electron density and the small elec-\ntron temperature enhancements. The heater wave in this\nscenario is now mainly absorbed below 65 km and the ri-\nometer absorption might be high, here above 8 dB, which is\nsometimes also observed experimentally during solar proton\nC.-F.

The modelled absorption enhancement during heat-\ning is still 0.6 dB, attributable to the electron temperature in-\ncrease (close to a factor of 2) around 60 km.\nFigure 6 shows a time series of modelled riometer absorp-\ntion for the entire noon and morning 8-MHz heating runs. In\nthe morning quiet-time background case, the absorption in-\ncreases slowly from a very low level during the heating inter-\nval. In the proton cases it is evident that the 5-min resolution\nof the heating model runs cannot reproduce the actual rise in\nthe absorption. More interesting is the almost instantaneous\nincrease from the background level when there is a D region\nwhich is preconditioned by electron precipitation. The ab-\nsorption subsequently stays almost constant during the heat-\ning interval.\nFig. 7. Time series of the relative change (between background and\n8-MHz heating noontime runs) in the ratios of negative ion to elec-\ntron density. 1: The quiet-day case; 2: The electron precipitation\ncase; 3: The proton precipitation case.\n1582 C.-F. Enell et al.: Heating effects on riometer absorption\nFigure 7 shows the relative change in the ratio of negative\nions to electrons between the background and heating runs.\nThese results confirm that an electron density depletion due\nto negative ion formation takes place. The exact rates of neg-\native ion reactions will therefore affect the rates of electron\ndensity changes when the heater is switched on and off. The\nchanges in negative ion densities also have a potential effect\non minor neutral components. Therefore, in-situ measure-\nments during heating would be a very interesting experiment\nto perform.\n6 Conclusions\nA number of test cases have been modelled and there is con-\nsistently an increase in cosmic noise absorption in the range\n0.2\u20130.8 dB for the more realistic geomagnetic conditions.\nAlthough the electron density is somewhat reduced during\nthe heating, due to production of negative ions, the fact that\nthe increased electron temperatures cause enhanced electron-\nneutral collision frequencies (and thus a larger absorption) in\nthe heated volume is dominate in all modelled cases. How-\never, runs for even larger proton fluxes (not shown here), re-\nsulting in a modelled background absorption (without heat-\ning) of up to 30 dB, indicate that at very high ionisation rates\nthe reduction of electron density due to negative ion produc-\ntion will dominate over the effect of increased collisional fre-\nquency. For such rare cases the effect of heating would be a\ndecreased absorption.\nThe sensitivity of IRIS is approximately 0.05 dB (Detrick\nand Rosenberg, 1990), i.e. one order of magnitude higher\nthan the expected modulation. Therefore, the predicted effect\nis detectable in this ideal case, where a good overlap between\nthe heated volume and the riometer beam is assumed.\nThe rise and fall times of the modulated absorption have\nbeen shown above (Fig. 6) to be different for the different\nconditions modelled. In the proposed experiments a prop-\nerly adapted combined SIC-heating model can be adjusted\nto reproduce the observed behaviour. In this way, we could\nimprove the estimates of, for example, electron-to-neutral at-\ntachment rates, using the lower ionosphere as a natural labo-\nratory.\nAcknowledgements.
