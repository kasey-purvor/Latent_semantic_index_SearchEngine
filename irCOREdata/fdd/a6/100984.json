Angular momentum generation by this mode competes with collective\nrotation. The experimental data are compared with tilted-axis cranking calculations, supporting the\nvibrational interpretation. However, the lower experimental energies provide evidence that more\ncomplex interactions of states are playing a role.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.91.182501 PACS numbers: 27.70.+q, 21.10.Jx, 21.10.Rependicular to the symmetry axis (i.e., with K \u0001 0). In transitions, whose energies span a small range withThe low-energy excitations of atomic nuclei can be\nunderstood as either being due to individual nucleonic\n(intrinsic) motions, or to collective rotations and vibra-\ntions of the bulk nuclear matter. In deformed nuclei, ro-\ntation typically dominates the high-angular-momentum\nstructure, since it usually generates angular momentum\nwith the lowest excitation energy. The lowest-energy\nstate, at a given angular momentum, is called an yrast\nstate, and such states have special status in nuclear-\nstructure physics. Despite high level density at high ex-\ncitation energy, the yrast states are readily identified\nexperimentally, sometimes up to angular momenta in\nexcess of 40 \u0003h, and with excitation energies greater\nthan 10 MeV. They therefore provide powerful probes of\nnuclear structure [1]. Notwithstanding the prevalence\nof rotational yrast states, there exists a small region\nof prolate deformed nuclei, centered on mass number A \u0001\n180, where few-nucleon, broken-pair excitations are\nfound to be energetically favored [2]. In this Letter, the\nfirst evidence is provided that, in combination with few-\nnucleon excitations, the multiphonon vibrational mode\ncan become the favored high-spin mode.\nA key feature in the A \u0001 180 region is that many of the\nindividual nucleon orbits, close to the neutron and proton\nFermi surfaces, have large angular-momentum projec-\ntions on the symmetry axis (the long axis) of the prolate-\ndeformed spheroidal nucleus. The individual projections\nsum up to give high-K, total projection values, and\nbroken-pair excitations are then able to compete with\ncollective rotation, which takes place about an axis per-0031-9007=03=91(18)=182501(4)$20.00 \uf6d9some cases, the energetically favored states combine\nthese two mutually perpendicular modes but, in accor-\ndance with the Bohr-Mottelson collective model [3], the\naddition of angular momentum by rotation requires\nmore energy than it would in the absence of the high-K\nvector. That is, the rotational energy follows the strong-\ncoupling formula, E\u0002 \u0003\u0003h2=\u00042=\u0006\u0007\u0003I\u0004I\b 1\u0006\tK2\u0007, where =\nis the moment of inertia, and I is the total angular mo-\nmentum. This leaves open the possibility for a favorable\norientation of quadrupole vibrations to play a role. The so-\ncalled \u0007 vibration has angular momentum I \u0002 2, oriented\nalong the symmetry axis (K \u0002 2). Such vibrations based\non nuclear ground states are well known, but their en-\nergy of about 1 MeV cannot compete with typical I \u0002 2\n(K \u0002 0) rotational energies of \u0001100 keV. However, the\nsituation may be radically different for \u0007 vibrations based\non high-K states, as we now report.\nThe present work focuses on the collective excita-\ntions of a K\b \u0002 25\b, 130 ns isomeric state of the nuclide\n182Os. Previous studies of 182Os [4\u20137] have established\nthe six-quasiparticle (three-broken-pair) structure of this\n7049-keV isomer, and given preliminary evidence [8] for\na fragmented level structure above the isomer. The latter\nstudy was, however, unable to fully disentangle the tran-\nsition sequences. The present work has exploited the large\nefficiency and resolving power of the Gammasphere\n\u0007-ray spectrometer [9], and the timing between beam\npulses and \u0007 rays, to establish the complex multiple struc-\ntures above the 130-ns isomer.

This suggests that the excitations may be\nof multiphonon vibrational character.\nHigh-spin states were populated in 182Os with the\n150Nd\u000436S; 4n\u0006 reaction. The 36S beam was supplied by\nthe 88-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory with a natural pulsing frequency of 14.2 MHz.\nA 1:0-mg=cm2 150Nd target (enriched to 89:9%) was used,\nwith a 7:3 mg=cm2 backing of 197Au to stop the nuclear\nrecoils in the focus of the array. The \u0007-\u0007 coincidence\ntiming window was defined such that the maximum time\ndifference between any two germanium-detector signals,\nconsidered to be part of the same event, was \u00011 \fs.\nMore experimental details are given in Ref. [10].\nThe partial level scheme for the principal structure\nabove the K\b \u0002 25\b isomeric state at 7049 keV is shown\nin Fig. 1, along with the extensions of the ground state and\nt bands in 182Os [4,11]. [The t band is based on an \u0004i13=2\u00062\nK\b \u0001 8\b band head with a strong rotational alignment\n[11].] In the present work, all structures withK \n 25were\nextended to higher spins, and the spin and parity of the\nisomer were firmly established to be K\b \u0002 25\b [12]. The\ntime-coincidence information, with respect to the beam\npulsing, enabled various prompt-delayed (across isomer)\nmatrices to be created. In particular, a prompt-delayed\nmatrix was constructed from gating on several delayed\ntransitions (80\u2013150 ns after the primary beam pulse)\nwhich lie below the 130 ns, K\b \u0002 25\b isomer, and select-\ning any prompt transitions (within 25 ns of the primary\nbeam pulse) which were part of the same event. Gates\nwere placed in these matrices and the \u0007-ray intensities\nand coincidence relationships were used to determine the\nordering of the \u0007 rays in the level scheme. Figure 2 shows\na prompt spectrum of the K\b \u0002 25\b structure in coinci-\ndence with a prompt 757-keV transition from this matrix.\nThe structure built directly upon the K\b \u0002 25\b iso-\nmeric state consists of two irregular sequences of\ninterlinked-E2 transitions (see Fig. 1). These sequences\nare unusual when compared with those of normal high-K\nrotational bands. For example, the \u0007-ray energy sequence\nis irregular, and the even-spin sequence is more strongly\npopulated than the odd-spin sequence. In addition, the\nlack of a systematic increase in transition energy and the\nrelatively small energy span, 157 keV (757\u2013914 keV), for\nthe six E2 transitions in each sequence are unexpected\nfeatures. A sequence of six collective K\b \u0002 25\b transi-\ntions would be expected to have gradually increasing\ntransition energies (proportional to spin) which would\nspan a much larger energy range, such as those in the\nground state and t bands. Finally, both sequences exhibit\ndecays to other structures which lie above the K\b \u0002 25\b\nisomer [12]. This would not normally be associated with\nhigh-K rotational bands, where the band generally only\ndecays out at the bandhead itself.\nThe anomalous aspects of the sequence above the\nK\b \u0002 25\b isomer may be interpreted as evidence for\nquadrupole vibrational excitations, in particular \u0007 vibra-\ntions, whose angular momentum vector is in the same\n182501-2direction (along the symmetry axis) as theK \u0002 25 intrin-\nsic motion. Under these circumstances, harmonic multi-\nphonon \u0007 vibrations would be expected to have equal E2\ntransition energies, which is close to the observed behav-\nior. A critical issue centers on the value of the phonon\nenergy. The \u0007 vibration based on the ground state of 182Os\nhas an energy of 891 keV [13], which is similar to the E2\nenergies in the structure above the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer.\nIndeed, due to the shallow potential-energy surface as a\nfunction of the \u0007 deformation, calculated by Xu et al. [7],\nit might be expected that there would be even lower\n\u0007-vibrational energies based on the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer.\nIn competition with \u0007 vibrations, the rotational energy\nwould be expected to be similar to that in the extension of\nthe ground-state band, e.g., 945 keV for the 28\b ! 26\b\ntransition [11]. This is only slightly greater than the ob-\nserved value of 861 keV in the structure above the K\b \u0002\n25\b isomer, leading to the possibility of admixture be-\ntween rotational and vibrational excitations of the K\b \u0002\n25\b configuration. This possibility is supported by the ob-\nservation of strong \u001aI \u0002 1 transitions: In the harmonic-\nvibration scenario, the vibrational angular momentum is\nin approximately the same direction as the magnetic-\nmoment vector of the K\b \u0002 25\b structure, that is along\nthe nuclear symmetry axis, and the M1 transitions\nwould be very weak. Therefore, a rotational component,\nperpendicular to the symmetry axis, is implied, in order\nto account for the \u001aI \u0002 1, M1 strength.182501-2\n200 400 600 800 1000\nENERGY (keV)\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nCO\nU\nN\nTS\n34\n3\u2022\n42\n1\u2022\n436\u2022\n440\u2022\n48\n1\n49\n3\u2022\n52\n6\u2022 57\n0\u2022\n58\n9\n78\n0\u2022\n81\n1\u2022\n83\n7\u2022\n84\n1\u202263\n K\n( \u03b1\n) X\n ra\ny\n71\n K\n(\u03b2)\n X\n ra\ny\n86\n1\n97\n1\n91\n4\u2022\n92\n17\n90\n27\n0\u2022\nFIG. 2.

The calculations, performed in the\nlimit of zero pairing, show that the energy in the rotating\nframe, or Routhian, E0\u0004!c; \u0013; \u0007\u0006 is nearly constant, at a\ncritical frequency (corresponding to half the E2 transi-\ntion energy) of !c \u0001 0:4 MeV, along a path in \u0013\t \u0007\nspace, as the angular momentum increases. (Here, \u0013 is\nthe tilt angle between the angular-momentum vector and\nthe long principal axis, and \u0007 is the triaxiality parameter:\n\u0007 \u0002 0\r for prolate shape, 30\r for triaxial shape and 60\r\nfor oblate shape.) The quadrupole (\u00142 \u0002 0:190) and hexa-\ndecapole (\u00144 \u0002 0:026) deformations are also found to be\nalmost constant. Since the energy E\u0004I\u0006 \u0002 E0\u0004!c\u0006 \b!cI,\nincreases linearly with I, then the transition energies are\nfound to be constant and equal to !c.

Figure 3 shows how the calculated and experi-\nmental excitation energies of the states progress with spin\nfor the ground-state band, the t band, and the structure\nabove the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer. The linear behavior of the\nlatter contrasts with the quadratic behavior of the ground\nstate and t bands.\nThe SCTAC calculations reveal that, as the spin in-\ncreases up the band, both the orientation angle \u0013 and the\ntriaxiality parameter \u0007 change, whereas the rotational\nfrequency remains constant. In a normal rotational band,\nthe angular momentum gain is due to the increasing an-\ngular frequency at an approximately constant shape. Thus,\nin this interpretation, the collective structure, based on\nthe K\b \u0002 25\b isomer, is very different from a normal ro-\ntational band. It is more like a multiphonon band. A \u0007vi-\nbration appears similar to a static triaxial deformation in\nthe frame of reference that rotates with the angular ve-\nlocity !\u0007. The triaxiality parameter \u0007 is proportional to\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\nn\np\n, where n is the number of phonons. This is similar to\nthe SCTAC result. The difference is that the phonons are\nnot traveling waves with respect to the long axis but have\na more complicated tilted geometry. The fact that the\nRouthian does not change along a \u0013\t \u0007 path, that com-\nbines changes of the angular momentum orientation and\nof the triaxiality of the shape, suggests that it is a similar\npath along which the high-K bands couple with the low-K\nbands. As discussed in Ref. [15], deviations from axial\nshape strongly enhance the coupling between different\norientations. The resulting coupling appears to be strong\nenough to partially destroy the effect of the K-selection\nrule, which is an important issue in the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer\ndecay in 182Os [4].\nThe SCTAC calculations offer an explanation for the\nanomalous properties of the structure built upon the\nK\b \u0002 25\b isomeric state. The linear relation between\nthe transition energy and spin is fairly well reproduced\nby the calculation [see Fig. 3(b)]. However, the calcula-\ntions apparently underestimate the effects of othertive to the K\b \u0002 25\b bandhead, and the B\u0004M1\u0006=B\u0004E2\u0006 ratios.\nB\u0004M1\u0006=B\u0004E2\u0006 \u0004\fN=eb\u00062 Calculated\nalculated Experiment \u0007\r \u0013\r\n20.7 \u000f \u000f \u000f \t7:4 19.0\n16.4 92:5\u0010 6:5 \t9:7 23.7\n13.4 22:6\u0010 1:1 \t12:2 26.8\n11.1 1:6\u0010 0:1 \t15:0 28.5\n9.6 1:7\u0010 0:1 \t17:6 29.2\n8.0 64:8\u0010 7:9 \t20:4 30.7\n7.0 3:4\u0010 0:2 \t22:9 31.9\n6.3 7:0\u0010 0:4 \t25:1 33.3\n5.6 2:1\u0010 0:1 \t27:2 34.8\n5.0 4:1\u0010 0:3 \t29:0 36.3\n4.3 1:2\u0010 0:1 \t31:1 37.3\n3.6 3:4\u0010 0:3 \t33:4 37.4\n3.0 5:3\u0010 0:3 \t35:0 36.0\n182501-3\n-4.0\n-3.5\n-3.0\n-2.5\n-2.0\nE x\n \n-\n \n0.\n40\n81\n I \n(M\neV\n)\n (+,0) K\u03c0=0+\n (+,0) t-band\n (+,1) t-band\n     calculated t-band\n     calculated ground-state band\n(a)\n-4.0\n-3.5\n-3.0\n-2.5\n-2.0\n20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40\nI  (h- )\n (+,0) K\u03c0=0+\n (+,0) Band above K\u03c0= 25+ Isomer\n (+,1) Band above K\u03c0= 25+ Isomer\n     Calculated K\u03c0= 25+ Isomer band\n     Calculated ground-state band\n(b)\nFIG. 3.

In\naddition, although the theoretical B\u0004M1; I ! I \t 1\u0006=\nB\u0004E2; I ! I \t 2\u0006 ratios fairly well reproduce the trend\nof the experimental data for many of the states, there\nare some discrepancies especially for the lower-spin val-\nues (see Table I). (The experimental I ! I \t 1 values\nassume that there is no E2 component.) These differences\nbetween the SCTAC model calculations and the experi-\nmental data can be taken as evidence for a complex inter-\naction of states in several mixed bands. (The SCTAC\ncalculation only follows the structure that gradually de-\nvelops from the K\b \u0002 25\b bandhead state and, in par-\nticular, these calculations predict a K \u0002 32 structure\nwhich may become important for spins > 30 \u0003h.)\nIn order to further investigate this effect, multiquasi-\nparticle Nilsson-model calculations based on a fixed\nshape (with BCS pairing) have also been performed for\n182Os. These calculations use the method of Jain et al. [16],\nwhere the monopole pairing strengths (Gn \u0002 21 MeV=A\nand Gp \u0002 22 MeV=A) were chosen to reproduce the one-\nquasiparticle states in the neighboring nuclei. Many in-\ntrinsic configurations are predicted to occur in the vicin-\nity of the K\b \u0002 25\b isomeric state, each of which would\nbe expected to have a \u0007-vibrational structure built upon it.\nAll of these states can interact and perturb the states of\nthe observed K\b \u0002 25\b structure and could thereby ex-\nplain the fluctuations in the experimental B\u0004M1\u0006=B\u0004E2\u0006\nvalues. Since there are uncertainties in the predicted182501-4relative energies of the configurations, which are caused\nby the uncertainties of the theoretical single-particle\nlevels, we have not attempted a full quantitative analysis\nin the present work. Although these bands cross each other\nin the I \u0001 30 region (see Fig. 3), interband transitions\nhave not been identified. A detailed report on the other\ncomplex structures observed above the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer,\nand the mixing calculations will be published in Ref. [12].\nIn summary, new structures have been established built\nupon the K\b \u0002 25\b isomeric state in 182Os. Although\nthese sequences appear somewhat irregular, the qualita-\ntive results suggest that the properties can be understood\nif the angular momentum is built up, to a large extent,\nfrom multiple phonons. Not only do the vibrations com-\npete with rotations in generating angular momentum\nabove the K\b \u0002 25\b isomer, but also, above 34 \u0003h, the\nhigh-K vibrational structure becomes the yrast structure\nof 182Os. We propose that, at high angular momentum, in\na well-deformed nucleus, the \u0007-vibrational energy can\nbecome lower than the rotational energy, albeit with\ncomplex admixtures. It is hoped that the present results\nstimulate further investigations of multiphonon states\nbuilt on high-K configurations. One important ingredient\ncould be an extension of the RPA approach [17].\nThe authors would like to thank G. D. Dracoulis for\nuseful discussions. D. M.
