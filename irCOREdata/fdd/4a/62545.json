This article describes the cloning and characterisation of the wap65-2 \ngene from the Antarctic plunderfish (Harpagifer antarcticus). The transcriptional \nexpression of this gene in response to elevated seawater temperatures over a time \ncourse series is presented. Initially there is strong down regulation of this gene to a \nmaximum of 40 fold within 4 hours, followed by recovery to almost control levels \nwithin 48 hours, indicating that this gene does not play a role in the potential \ntemperature adaptation of H. antarcticus.  \n \n \n 2\nWAP65 \nIntroduction \nWhilst environmental adaptation and the capacity to cope with change is a  \nspecies-specific phenomenon, poikilothermic animals are clearly far more vulnerable \nto environmental temperature changes compared to homeotherms. However many \neurythermal aquatic poikilotherms experience and adapt to wide variations in natural \nwater temperatures. Examples of such include a seasonal 30\u00baC temperature range \nfor goldfish and carp and 13\u00b0C weekly variations experienced in ephemeral pond \nenvironments inhabited by the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus. Therefore \nwithin each species there is the capacity for physiological and biochemical \nreorganisation to enable adaptation to either warmer or cooler seasonal \ntemperatures, a process termed acclimatization (Hazel and Prosser, 1974). In the \nexperimental context this process has been re-named acclimation to delineate \nlaboratory manipulation from conditions found in the natural environment. \nProtein 2-D gel electrophoresis experiments identified a 65-kDa protein that \naccumulated in various tissues in goldfish (Carassius auratus) and carp (Cyprinus \ncarpio) acclimated to 30\u00baC for a minimum of 5 weeks (Watabe et al, 1993; Kikuchi et \nal, 1993). This was subsequently named Warm Acclimated Protein (wap65). These \nfish proteins showed 31% sequence identity to rat hemopexin. This is a protein \nsynthesised in the rat liver and plays an important role scavenging haems from \nblood. The mRNA for wap65 in C. auratus is rapidly amplified in the liver to a \nmaximum of a 40 fold increase on day 3 of temperature acclimation experiments \nwith a subsequent decline to a steady 10 fold increase for long-term acclimated \nstocks (Kikuchi et al, 1997). This finding is concurrent with the gene product having \nan acclimation function at least in these fish species. Further analyses on other fish \nspecies (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Ictalurus punctatus, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes and \nTakifugu rubripes) have shown that in contrast to the single isoform found in \nmammals, wap65 is present in duplicate in fish, presumably as a result of the teleost \nwhole genome duplication event (Amores et al, 1998). These fish isoforms display \ndifferent affinities for haem, tissue distributions and development patterns (Hirayama \net al, 2003; 2004; Nakaniwa et al, 2005). \nIn contrast to the eurythermal examples quoted earlier, some animals exist \nwithin a very narrow environmental temperature envelope. For example most \nAntarctic marine species are highly stenothermal (Somero and DeVries, 1967; Peck \net al, 2000) having adapted to life in the Southern Ocean at stable sub zero \ntemperatures. The ability of these animals to adapt\/acclimatize to warmer sea \ntemperatures is of prime importance given the current IPCC Third Assessment \nclimate models and predictions of global climate change. \nIn our laboratory, a number of experiments have been carried out to \ninvestigate the effects of elevated water temperatures on the gene expression profile \nof the Antarctic plunderfish (Harpagifer antarcticus). During EST screening a number \nof clones were identified with high sequence similarity wap65. Here we describe the \ncharacterisation of the gene for the H. antarcticus wap65 and the effects of an \nelevated water temperature regime (6\u00baC) on expression levels over a 48-hour time \ncourse. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nAnimal sampling \nH. antarcticus used in the experimental work were collected at Rothera \nResearch Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o 34\u05f3 07\u05f4 S, 68o 07\u05f3 30\u05f4 W) \nby SCUBA divers during the austral summer. The animals were returned to the UK in \na refrigerated transport aquarium and maintained in a recirculating aquarium at close \nto 0 oC until required for experimental work. Thirty five fish were transferred to the \n 3\nWAP65 \nexperimental tank at time zero and maintained at 6.0 \u00b1 0.08oC. Five animals were \nkilled at zero, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours using Home Office approved procedures.  \n \nCloning and sequencing \nApproximately 1,000 clones were sequenced from a directionally cloned non-\nnormalised H. antarcticus liver cDNA library. All clones were vector and quality \nclipped before subjecting to BLAST sequence similarity searching. Analysis of BLAST \nresults identified 10 ESTs, which showed high sequence similarity to the warm-\ntemperature-acclimation-related-65 protein (accession number Q4W7I1). These 10 \nEST clones were concatenated and edited using the phred, Phrap and consed \npackages (Ewing and Green 1998; Gordon et al, 1998). Sequence analysis was \nperformed using the EMBOSS suite of open source software  \nhttp:\/\/emboss.sourceforge.net. Alignments were exported into Boxshade \n(http:\/\/www.ch.embnet.org\/software\/BOX_form.html) for annotation. The H. \nantarcticus Wap65 sequence was submitted to the EMBL database with the accession \nnumber AM408054. \n \nRNA Isolation and Q-PCR \nTotal RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using TRI Reagent (Sigma) \naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u03bcg of total RNA was DNase treated \nand reverse transcribed using a first strand synthesis kit (Promega). Profiling of \ntissue-specific expression and Q-PCR was carried out using the following primers: \nAcclim2F (TAGAGCACTACTACTGTTTCCA) and Acclim2Rev \n(AGGCCGTCACGCTTGGTGT); (ActinF: ACAGACTACCTCATGAAGATCCT; ActinR: \nGAGGCCAGGATGGAGCCTCC). Actin was used as the housekeeping sequence for \nboth RT and Q-PCR experiments as it had previously been shown not to change \nunder the experimental conditions used (data not shown). For Q-PCR, both primer \nsets were checked over a four fold 10x dilution series with RSq values and PCR \nefficiency values (1.00 and 100.8% respectively for Wap65) calculated using the \nMxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software. Wap65 and actin sequences \nwere amplified from each time point using Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR Master Mix \n(Stratagene) and an MX3000P (Stratagene). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 10 \nminutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute with a \nfinal dissociation curve step. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR experiment consisted \nof 5 control individuals and 5 experimental individuals (both in triplicate). Analysis \nwas performed using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software \nand data exported into the Relative Expression Software tool (REST) \n(http:\/\/www.gene-quantification.info\/), which incorporates the Pfaffl method of \ncompensating for the PCR efficiency and also uses a Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation \nRandomisation Test (Pfaffl et al, 2002). The results were also subjected to a 2-\nsample t-test using MINITAB v14 to determine significance and delineate the 95% \nconfidence range.  \n \nResults \nConcatenation of EST data (10 clones) produced a 1367nt consensus \nsequence of high quality reads. BLAST sequence similarity searching of this sequence \nrevealed 72% sequence identity (Expect = 1.9e-174, Score = 1711) with the warm-\ntemperature-acclimation-related-65 protein (accession number Q4W7I1) from the \nMedaka fish Oryzias latipes. Sequence comparisons identified that the full-length \nwap-65 coding sequence of 431 amino acids was present with 23 nts and 51nts of 5\u2019 \nand 3\u2019 UTR respectively. Sequence alignments using Clustal W (Figure 1) indicate \nthat the H. antarcticus gene shares greater sequence similarity to the fish wap65-2 \n 4\nWAP65 \nisoform (72.2% sequence identity to O. latipes  wap65-2, but only 49% sequence \nidentity to O. latipes  wap65-1). No library clones were identified with high sequence \nsimilarity to wap65-1. Examination of the H. antarcticus gene with regard to \nhemopexin motifs indicates a similar protein structure with 10 cysteines conserved \n(out of 12 in mammals) to produce disulphide bridges. This gene also contains 6 \n(Trp196, Tyr201, Phe208, Tyr222, tyr229 and Phe230) out of the 7 aromatic \nresidues plus Pro 294 that have been defined as important for the structure and \nstability of the haem pocket and also both histidine (His213 and His266) residues \nwhich form the bis-histidyl Fe(III) complex involved in haem axial ligand binding \n(Paoli et al, 1999). However the H. antarcticus gene only contains a single N-\nglycosylation site and N-glycosylation has been shown to be important in haem \nbinding. Tissue distribution of H. antarcticus wap65-2 was examined by RT-PCR over \na range of 15 tissues in control animals. There was a very limited distribution with \nstrong expression in the liver and much lower expression in the posterior kidney only \n(Figure 2). Q-PCR revealed that H. antarcticus wap65-2 was not induced in response \nto an increased environmental temperature of 6\u00baC. In fact a sigmodal-shape \nresponse was produced when the data is plotted as log fold expression change \nverses time, with considerable initial down regulation (approximately 40 fold) for the \nfirst 8 hours followed by re-equilibration to base-line levels around zero (Figure 3). \nThe smallest p value for this dataset is 0.069, which is not significant at the 95% \nlevel, but the p values are supportive of the general trend outlined above. In this \nexperiment, variation in gene expression was high due to a limited data set and high \ninter-individual variation, as would be expected from a wild population study. This \nwide genetic variation clearly affects significance testing and the resultant p values. \n \nDiscussion \nThe designation of wap65, isoform 2 via sequence similarity analyses was \nvalidated by the tissue distribution. Wap65-2 has a much more restricted tissue \ndistribution (mainly liver), compared to wap65-1, which is present in multiple tissues \nin O. latipes and Takifugu (Hirayama et al, 2003; 2004). In spite of the presence of \nthe two conserved histidine residues proposed to be essential for haem binding, \nother fish orthologues of Wap65-2, which also contain these residues, do not show \nan affinity for haem (Hirayama et al, 2004). There is sufficient conservation of gene \nsequence between H. antarcticus wap65-2 and O. latipes wap65-2 to suggest that \nthe two genes are functional orthologues. Although true acclimation experiments for \nperiods of several weeks were not carried out on H. antarcticus, the 6\u00baC time course \nassay was carried out for a 48 hour period, during which, based on previously \npublished findings, wap65 should have been significantly induced. In contrast, in H. \nantarcticus expression of wap65-2 was down regulated for a period of between 8-12 \nhours, after which levels returned to those of the control base line. The \nconsequences of which are that the H. antarcticus  wap65-2 is not involved in \ntemperature acclimation. The initial drop in expression may well be due to a primary \n\u201cshock\u201d response. This is mirrored in other genes that we have surveyed from the \nsame animals in this time course assay (unpublished data), with the fish \nsubsequently adjusting, at least in terms of gene transcription processes, to the \nelevated water temperature. If this is subsequently proved to be the situation, then \nthe speed of the initial drop in expression levels and lag to return to a steady state is \nprobably a function of mRNA stability and gene regulation respectively. Several \nexperiments have been successfully carried out to acclimate Antarctic fish to 4\u00b0C \n(Carpenter and Hofmann, 2000; Lowe et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2006). Therefore, \nalthough these fish survive in a stable environment of \u20131.8\u00baC to +1.0\u00b0C almost year-\nround, they do potentially have the ability to acclimate to higher water temperatures \n 5\nWAP65 \nthan they experience in the natural environment. However, this acclimation process \nis unlikely to involve wap65-2. \nThis finding adds further data to the complex regulation of wap65 isoforms in \nfish. This gene set  has also been shown to be induced in response to immunological \nstimulus using LPS and hypoxia in C. auratus  (Kikuchi et al, 1997; Gracey et al, \n2001). However, there is no elevation in the expression of either of the two wap65 \nisoforms to induction by LPS in O. latipes (Hirayama et al, 2004) or to environmental \ntemperature increases in O. latipes and T. rubripes (Hirayama et al, 2003). Indeed, \nso far, the correlation of increased expression levels of wap65 with increased \nenvironmental temperature have only been identified in the Cypriniformes, \nspecifically the wap65-1 isoform. Takifugu, H. antarcticus  and O. latipes belong to \nthe orders: Perciformes and Atheriniformes, so potentially this acclimation function of \nwap65 is phylogenetically constrained. The biochemical processes, by which Antarctic \nfish acclimate to warmer sea temperatures remains unknown. Experiments are on-\ngoing in our laboratory using cDNA microarrays and long term acclimation \nexperiments to decipher this process. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was produced within the BAS Q4 BIOREACH\/BIOFLAME core programme. \nThe authors would like to thank the Rothera dive team for sample collection, Pete \nRothery for statistics advice and Keiron Fraser for help in performing the heat shock \nexperiments.  \n 6\nWAP65 \n \nReferences \n \nAmores A, Force A, Yan YL, et al. 1998.
