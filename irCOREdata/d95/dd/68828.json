The world, then, \nmay at last be waking up to the global crisis of climate change; this also testifies to the \nglobal connectedness possible with modern electronic media. \n \nEnvironment 2.0 was initiated in 2006 to explore contributions to the sustainability of \nthe way we live our lives. It involves participatory art and design projects that \ncollaboratively produce and make sense of information about natural, built and social \nenvironments. We envision an exploration of how locative art can develop \u201cnew senses\u201d \nand share discoveries with neighbors and people around the globe to become a part of a \nworldwide network of \u201cone billion eyes.\u201d \n \nEnvironment 2.0 has taken me on a journey, comprising encounters with climatologists, \nclimate hackers, DNA barcoders, urban gardeners, peak oil activists, butterfly \nenthusiasts and all points between. Staging events in Manchester, Singapore, Lancaster, \nAmsterdam and Berlin, I began in the role of curator and artist, and along the way found \nmyself in discussions with the U.K.'s Ministry of Transport on how art methods can \nignite innovation on sustainable transport, working as a weather forecaster with the Met \nOffice in a series of mass participation projects, and adding an engagement with the \nenvironment to the FutureEverything festival's now-perennial themes of society, \ntechnology and the city. \n \nIn urban environments in particular, we are separated from the consequences of our \nactions as surely as the tarmac of the road cuts us off from the earth beneath. This \nphysical boundary encourages a phenomenological separation. Innovative approaches to \nparticipatory observation and mapping can overcome this separation when combined \nwith the way the Internet and digital media have enabled individuals to produce and \nshare information globally and instantly. Cracks in the pavement can be widened by \ncreative intervention or social innovation---artworks, social entrepreneurship, scientific \nintervention or innovations that harness everyday creativity. \n \nSociety\u2019s relationship with the environment is increasingly mediated by digital tools. \nIndustrial societies have viewed the environment as a resource to be exploited and \ntamed. Now a new relationship to environment is beginning to emerge. Mapped, tagged \nand digitized, the world ceases to be inert raw material (or standing reserve) and \nbecomes instead digitally navigable, computable, manipulable, understandable and \nexperience-able in new ways. \n \nPervasive and locative arts enable people collectively to participate in sampling their \nlives, cities and environments, producing new datasets and visualizations in an active \nengagement with the mediated environment. These forms enable monitoring of digital \ntraces in the environments: footprints in a navigable world. This makes possible an \ninterface between our digital footprint, our environmental footprint, the resources we \nuse and the burden we place on the environment. \n \nGlocal, lobal connections are critical here. One of the Internet\u2019s most powerful impacts, \nin fact, is at a local level. Social technologies can be a catalyst for local social interactions; \nwitness the success of schemes such as Freecycle and craigslist. These global \ntechnologies can also enable people to experience and monitor the changing climate and \nthe effects of what they do, locally and globally. \n \nIncreasingly, people are routinely generating data about their environment simply by \nusing media devices connected to the Internet. There are possibilities for environmental \nsensing that leverage social networks at a very large scale, and for community sensing \ninvolving social media and pervasive networks. Envisioning millions of users, each a \nbroadcaster, presents challenges of the intelligibility of a million different data sources, \nas well as issues of accountability. \n \nAs the heat rises, more and more people are engaging with the environment and the \nchallenge of climate change in creative and often unexpected ways. Environment 2.0 \ninvestigates the potential for participatory mass observation and builds in a capacity to \ncollect, interpret and develop a critical mass of ideas, experiences and motivations into \nsolutions that can transform our engagement in the environment. \n \nDrew Hemment \nLeonardo Guest Editor \nMember, Leonardo Lovely Weather Working Group \nEnvironment 2.0 \n<http:\/\/labs.futureeverything.org\/env20> \n"}
