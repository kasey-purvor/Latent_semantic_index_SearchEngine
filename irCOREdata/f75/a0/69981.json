Introduction: subglacial rhyolite eruptions \n \nIn recent years a number of field studies in Iceland have yielded new insights into the \nrange of behaviour exhibited by rhyolitic eruptions beneath ice. The spectrum of \ndocumented eruption types, summarised in McGarvie (this issue) includes small-\nvolume effusive eruptions dominated by quench hyaloclastite (Furnes et al. 1980, \nTuffen et al. 2001), larger-volume explosive eruptions, some of which pierce the ice \nsurface and create tuyas (Tuffen et al. 2002a, Stevenson 2005, Stevenson et al. 2006), \nmixed eruptions with both explosive and effusive behaviour (Tuffen et al. 2008a) and \nlarger volume effusive eruptions (McGarvie et al. 2007).  \n The salient findings of these studies include: 1) subglacial cavities are \ngenerally well-drained although some meltwater is available to interact with rising \nmagma; 2) in effusive eruptions the ice roof is close to the growing edifice; 3) \nexplosive eruptions involve significant magma vesiculation, 3) tuya-building \neruptions terminate with effusion of degassed, subaerial lava flows and 4) interactions \nbetween magma and water include phreatomagmatic fragmentation, quench \nfragmentation and perlite formation. The range of styles of eruption has been \nattributed to a range of magma discharge rates \u2013 with explosive eruptions favoured by \nrapid magma discharge and melting (Tuffen et al. 2007) although different magma \nvolatile contents may also be important.  \n Another factor that has not been considered is the contrasting effect that \ndifferent ice thicknesses may have on the mechanisms of rhyolitic eruptions, as most \ndeposits studied to date are inferred to have been emplaced beneath relatively thick \nice (>150 to >600 m). Detailed studies of subglacially erupted basaltic sequences have \nshown that there are important differences between the products of eruptions under \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nthick and thin ice (Smellie and Skilling 1994, Smellie 2000). Basaltic eruptions under \nthin ice (<150 m) involve considerably less magma-meltwater interaction due to the \npermeable nature of the ice, as the rate of ice deformation around subglacial \nmeltwater drainage channels is sluggish, allowing efficient drainage of meltwater \nthrough a hydrological system that is most likely at atmospheric pressure. By contrast \nbasaltic eruptions beneath thicker ice are characterised by the formation of a quasi-\nstable englacial or ice-contact lake and extensive interaction between rising magma \nand meltwater (e.g. Skilling 1994). \nMeltwater accumulation is thought to be much less important during rhyolitic \neruptions under ice, possibly due to the positive pressure changes expected during \nmelting of ice by lower-temperature rhyolitic magma (Hoskuldsson and Sparks 1997, \nTuffen et al. 2002b). Nonetheless it is not known whether the degree of interaction \nwith meltwater differs during rhyolitic eruptions beneath thick and thin ice, or \nwhether the mechanism of rhyolitic eruptions beneath thin ice differ greatly from \nthose beneath ice hundreds of metres thick. The aim of this paper is thus to document \nfor the first time the products of a rhyolitic eruption beneath thin ice \u2013 at Krafla in \nnorthern Iceland \u2013 and to reconstruct the type of interaction between magma and ice \nand meltwater that occurred, before considering which factors may have controlled \nthe mechanisms of the eruption. \n \n2. Geological setting of Krafla central volcano \n \nKrafla central volcano is located on the northern rift zone of Iceland (Fig. 1) and  \ncomprises a ~15 km diameter central volcano and a 100-km-long basaltic fissure \nswarm. Rhyolitic volcanism at Krafla occurred in two main phases, each of which \nproduced about 1 km3 of magma (Jonasson 1994), followed by a smaller third phase. \nThe first phase occurred at about 100 ka, near the beginning of the last glacial period, \nand may have triggered collapse of a ~8 \u00d7 6 km caldera. The eruption generated a \nrhyolitic dome at H\u00e1g\u00f6ng and a 2.5 km3 welded airfall tuff that comprises 1 km3 of \nrhyolitic magma that was incompletely mixed with basaltic magma. The second phase \nalso occurred during the last glacial period and formed three subglacial rhyolite ridges \njust outside the caldera rim. These are J\u00f6rundur, Hli\u00f0arfjall and Gaesafjallarani (Fig. \n1), which are about 300 m high and have a total volume of 0.7 km3. They consist of \nrhyolitic lava lobes and quench hyaloclastite.  \n The third phase involved a small-volume (<0.05 km3) rhyolitic eruption that \nformed Hrafntinnuhryggur (Obsidian Ridge) at about 24 ka (Ar\/Ar date from \nS\u00e6mundsson et al. 2000), a minor eruption near Krokkuvotn that generated mixed \ndacitic-andesitic lavas and hyaloclastites, and two postglacial eruptions of rhyolitic \npumice, the Hveragil tephra at about 9000 BP and the 1724 Viti pumice (Jonasson \n1994). Krafla volcano is best known for the spectacular 1975-1984 basaltic fissure \neruption and associated rifting (e.g. Einarsson and Brandsdott\u00edr 1980). \n \n3. Structure of Hrafntinnuhryggur  \n \nHrafntinnuhryggur is a south-southwest \u2013 north-northeast trending ridge 2.5 km in \nlength within the eastern part of the Krafla caldera (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3a). It rises up \nto 80 m above the surrounding land and has a maximum elevation of 706 m. \nHrafntinnuhryggur is bounded to the east and south by glacially eroded basaltic \nhyaloclastites and lavas, to the northeast by the altered rhyolitic formations of Krafla \nmountain and to the west by vegetation-covered subaerial basaltic lava flows. It is the \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \neasternmost and longest of three parallel fissures that follow the regional tectonic \ntrend, the other two having produced small volumes of basaltic spatter (Fig. 2, Fig. \n3a). Two shallow depressions on the western side of the ridge, one of which harbours \nan ephemeral lake, are thought to be explosion craters and could be related to the \nHrafntinnuhryggur eruption.  \n Hrafntinnuhryggur consists of several small-volume rhyolitic lava flows and \ndome-like bodies fed by a feeder dyke, which is exposed at the southern end of the \nridge. Minor amounts of fragmental lithofacies are also locally exposed. Due to \nvegetation and scree exposure is patchy, being best close to the ridge crest and less \ngood on its flanks (Fig. 3a). There is no evidence for any glacial erosion of the ridge, \napart from at its southern end below about 640 m, where erosion has exposed the \nfeeder dyke down to an elevation of 595 m.  \n There have been only two published studies of Hrafntinnuhryggur to date, \nthose of Wright (1915) and Jonasson (1994). Wright described the growth of \nlithophysae and etching processes of the obsidian by corrosive hydrothermal fluids. \nJonasson described the petrology of the Hrafntinnuhryggur magma in a paper \naddressing the genesis of rhyolitic magma at Krafla. To our knowledge there has been \nno published study of the lithofacies or reconstruction of the eruptive environment. \n \n3.1. Overall morphology of lava bodies at Hrafntinnuhryggur \n \nDue to obscured contacts the number of individual lava bodies is uncertain but is \nlikely to be between 9 and 12, all but one of which occur on the main ridge itself (Fig. \n2). The exception is a small rhyolite lava body that crops out ~300 m to the west, \napproximately parallel with the larger of the two basaltic fissures (locality DD on Fig. \n2). Lava bodies on the main ridge range from ~70-750 m in length (parallel to the \nridge axis) and their exposed widths range from 20-200 m. Lava thicknesses can only \nbe estimated due to lack of exposed bases, but the range 20-50 m seems reasonable, \nbased on the ridge morphology. Lavas typically crop out as a series of ~10 m high \ncliffs on the upper flank of the ridge, which can be traced laterally for hundreds of \nmetres (Fig. 3). Pumiceous zones on flow tops are less well exposed but can \ncommonly be identified from the presence of pale, weathered pumiceous clasts \nlittering the upper surface of the ridge. Likewise the location of obsidian margins of \nlava bodies can sometimes be inferred from patches of black obsidian scree. The \ncontact with older rocks is exposed in two localities (Fig. 2) \u2013 at locality AP on the \neastern flank and at the southern end of the ridge where the feeder dyke cuts basaltic \nhyaloclastite. The majority of lava bodies have a near-horizontal sheet-like form with \nan approximately flat-lying upper surface, although one has a dome-like morphology \n(locality AJ, Fig. 2). The orientation of flow banding structures within lava bodies \nwas measured and is plotted on Fig. 4, together with the distribution of columnar \njoints, perlitic textures and measured water contents. Banding is mostly very steeply \ndipping and strikes roughly parallel to the long axis of the ridge. \n \n \n4. Lithofacies descriptions \nThe lithofacies at Hrafntinnuhryggur can be grouped into the following categories: \nintrusive (feeder dyke and perlitic lavas), fragmental (pumiceous tuffs and perlitic \nhyaloclastite breccias) and effusive lavas. The four principal textural zones of the \nlavas are described, as well as their pumiceous flow tops, columnar-jointed sides and \na basal contact with the bedrock. Details of these facies are summarised in Table 1 \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nand each one is described in detail below, following the order given above. Figure 5 \nschematically shows how they relate to each other. Note that whereas the geological \nmap in Fig. 2 indicates the location of lava bodies and key outcrops the scale does not \nallow the spatial distribution of different zones to be shown \n \n \n4.1. Intrusive facies \n4.1.1. Feeder dyke \n \nThe feeder dyke crops out at the southern terminus of the ridge at ~595 m elevation, \nwhere a >2 m wide dyke of obsidian trending north-northeast is exposed (locality I on \nFig. 2, Fig. 6a), although contacts with country rock are not seen. Despite intermittent \noutcrop the dyke can be traced for about 50 m to the north at ~610 m elevation, where \nit flares to 5 m in width and the contact with country rock (basaltic hyaloclastite) is \nexposed (locality G). The dyke then appears to further flare to >10 m in width at 620 \nm elevation and feeds a gently inclined lava body >500 m in length, which forms the \ncrest of the southern part of the ridge.  \n At its southernmost outcrop (Fig. 3a,c) the >2 m-wide dyke consists of black \nobsidian containing ~5-10 % vesicles that are strongly elongated (axial strain of up to \n50, with lengths up to 50 mm but widths typically <1 mm). Vesicle strain is parallel to \nthe dyke walls and the axis of elongation points upwards towards the north-northeast, \ndirectly towards the lava fed by the dyke. The strain is therefore consistent with \nlateral transport of magma, although the flow direction cannot be reconstructed \nwithout magnetic measurements (Canon-Tapia & Castro 2004). Jointing in the \nobsidian is a intermediate between hexagonal columns and parallel platy fractures, \nwith joints normal to both the dyke margins and the vesicle alignment, and spaced 4-7 \ncm apart (Fig. 3a,c). There is no obvious variation in jointing, vesicle strain or \nabundance across the dyke. \n Where the contact with basaltic hyaloclastite is exposed at locality G (Fig. 3b) \nthe ~5 m-wide dyke comprises 1-2 m thick obsidian margins directly adjacent to the \nhyaloclastite, which displays a ~30 cm thick baked zone, and a 1 m thick devitrified \ninner portion. Although the obsidian margins are crumbly and poorly preserved they \nappear to be cut by columnar joints spaced about 5 cm apart. To the north at ~620 m \nelevation the dyke further flares to feed an overlying lava body, where there is a 1-2 \nm thick columnar-jointed obsidian margin surrounding a devitrified lava core, which \nis cut by fanning clusters of columnar joints 7-11 cm apart and 2 m or more in length. \nThese joints cross-cut flow banding and deformed vesicles in the obsidian and \npenetrate the entire exposed thickness of the lava. Vesicles exhibit much lower strain \nthan in the narrowest part of the dyke. Elsewhere on the ridge the feeder dyke is not \nexposed, although lava outcrops are probably underlain by a near-vertical shallow \ndyke 2.5 km in length. \n We attribute the change in columnar joint orientation and spacing from the \ndyke to the lava flow to a change from quenching against water-saturated country \nrocks in a small, stable, confined system to quenching by external water\/ice in an \nunconfined but larger-volume lava body in which localised crack formation and lava \nmovement created more irregular cooling patterns.  \n \n4.1.2. Perlitic obsidian lava \n \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nAt lower elevations on the western ridge flank (mostly beneath 660 m elevation) there \nare large patches of obsidian scree punctuated by occasional outcrops of columnar-\njointed, perlitic obsidian (Fig. 7a). The obsidian is commonly strongly altered, with \netching of glass surfaces, dissolution of spherulites and growth of zeolitic minerals on \nthe surfaces of columnar joints, as seen in Fig. 7b where the contact with perlitic \nbreccias is exposed. The columns mostly range from 5 to 12 cm in width and show no \nsystematic pattern of alignment. Locally, highly fractured perlitic lavas grade \noutwards into indurated breccia cemented by alteration minerals, although it is \ndifficult to distinguish between truly fragmental facies and net-veining caused by \nalteration (Allen 1988).  Flow folding and vesicle populations are largely similar to \nthose seen in the better exposed lavas on the ridge crest. The perlitic texture \ncomprises beads of black glass ~0.1-0.5 cm across surrounded by grey, hydrated \nglass.  \n The pervasive perlitisation and hydrothermal alteration of lavas, \npreponderance of columnar joints and association with fragmental lithologies are all \ntaken as evidence for extensive interaction between cooling lavas and meteoric fluids \nboth syn- and post-eruption. Although exposure is poor, the lavas are inferred to have \nintruded meltwater-saturated, quench-fragmented breccias. The absence of any \npeperitic textures contrasts with those formed when lavas have intruded fine-grained \nashes (c.f. Tuffen et al. 2002, Tuffen et al. 2008a), perhaps reflecting the less effective \nmeltwater-driven fragmentation at Hrafntinnuhryggur than at other locations. \n \n4.2. Fragmental lithofacies \n \nFragmental lithofacies are mostly poorly exposed, thus only brief description and \ntentative interpretations are provided here. Notable outcrops occur at the northern end \nof the ridge, where the contact with lavas is exposed (O on Fig. 2) and between 650 \nand 685 m elevation on the west flank of the southern part of the ridge. \n \n4.2.1 Pumiceous tuffs \n \nAt locality N on the northern part of the ridge (Fig. 2) a massive, pale grey-brown \nloose tuff at least 5 m in thickness is found. The tuff has a predominant matrix \ngrainsize of 100-200 microns. It contains up to 60 % angular pumice lapilli <5 cm in \nlength and a much smaller proportion of angular obsidian fragments with similar \ntextures to the fractured outer margins of lava bodies. Although no geochemical data \nwere taken the tuff is therefore inferred to be juvenile. A similar lithology crops out \non the west side of the southern part of the ridge (Fig. 2).  \n Although there is inadequate information for a confident reconstruction of the \nemplacement mechanisms, we speculate that these pumiceous tuffs represent \nexplosively-generated ashes formed during magmatic fragmentation although the role \nof external water cannot be ruled out. The structureless and poorly sorted nature of the \ndeposits is similar to vent-proximal pyroclastic deposits formed during explosive \nsubglacial activity (e.g. Tuffen et al. 2002a, Tuffen et al. 2008a). \n \n4.2.2. Perlitic hyaloclastite breccias \n \nAt locality O on the northern part of the ridge (Fig. 2) a sharp, irregular contact \nbetween patches of shattered, zeolite-veined black obsidian and crumbly clast-\nsupported, locally jigsaw-fit grey obsidian breccia was exposed by digging (Fig. 7b). \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nThe spacing of fractures bounding intact, unaltered clasts in the obsidian matches the \npoorly-defined boundaries of crumbly breccia clasts. The breccias are therefore \ntentatively interpreted as hydrothermally altered, quench-fragmented breccias \nassociated with the margins of meltwater-quenched lava bodies, similar to better-\nexposed quench hyaloclastites at Torfaj\u00f6kull (Furnes et al. 1980, Tuffen et al. 2001). \n The flanks of the ridge, especially the western flank of the southern part of the \nridge, are mantled by obsidian-pumice breccias (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), but these are thought \nto be formed by post-eruptive, and possibly postglacial gravitational spalling of \ndetritus from the ridge. \n \n4.3. Effusive facies - lava flows and domes \n \nAlthough there is some variability, lava bodies typically display distinctive textural \nzonation between their interiors and bases, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. The \ntextural zones comprise a) an outer zone of locally perlitised, extensively fractured \nblack obsidian associated with hyaloclastites, surrounding b) colourful flow-banded \nobsidian with small-scale faulting, c) a vesiculated lithophysae-rich zone and d) a \nspherulitic inner zone. Additionally pumiceous flow tops are locally observed (zone \ne), together with columnar-jointed flow sides (zone f) and, in one locality, the contact \nbetween a lava base and the underlying rock (zone g). It is impossible to show the \ndistribution of these zones on the geological map in Fig. 2 as most zones are far too \nnarrow to be represented, but the location of good examples of each zone is indicated \non the map. The zones are described in detail below: \n \n4.3.1. Fractured obsidian lower margins (zone a) \n \nBest exposed at localities BQ and G (Fig. 2) this zone of black phenocryst- and \nvesicle-free obsidian is locally exposed at the lower margins of lava bodies. The \nobsidian is cut by columnar-to-platy joints typically spaced 5-10 cm apart, which are \nperpendicular to the lava body margins (Fig. 8a). As the zone thickness is only 1-2 m \nit cannot be indicated on the geological map (Fig. 2), but it crops out locally at the \nlower margin of the spherulitic lava bodies. Where exposed the obsidian zone either \ngrades out into perlitic, jigsaw-fit breccias (at locality N on the north part of the ridge) \nor directly contacts country rock (at locality G). In some localities (such as directly \neast of the larger of the two craters) the obsidian is strongly etched and fractures are \ninvaded by zeolitic minerals, indicating considerable post-eruptive hydrothermal \nalteration (Wright 1915).  \n We interpret that this zone was formed by quenching and fracturing of magma \nin contact with either waterlogged country rocks or water-saturated, cogenetic \nhyaloclastite breccias. It is therefore analogous to the outer zone of intrusive lava \nlobes at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (Tuffen et al. 2001). Perlitic alteration indicates significant \nhydration of glasses by external water (e.g. Davis & McPhie 1996), consistent with \nthe quench fracturing and hyaloclastite formation associated with the lava margins. \n \n4.3.2. Faulted flow-banded obsidian (zone b) \n \nThis zone, whose width can range from decimetres to over a metre, occurs \nimmediately inwards from the quench fractured obsidian margin and comprises flow-\nbanded obsidian, with blue, grey, brown, green and black bands spanning a range of \nwidths from <1 mm to >1 cm. It is best seen on the eastern flank at localities such as \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nAO and AI. The banding is offset by millimetres to centimetres on prominent curved \nor near-planar faults (Fig. 8b), which have so thoroughly healed that they do not affect \nthe morphology of conchoidal fracture surfaces formed upon hammering. Thin \nsection analysis reveals a complex collage of textures generated by superimposed \nphases of ductile shearing, vesiculation, bubble collapse, faulting, fragmentation and \nhealing (Fig. 8c,d). This reflects a prolonged period of deformation spanning the \nbrittle-ductile transition (Tuffen et al. 2003), a process that will be described in detail \nelsewhere.  \n We speculate that the fracturing may have been due to high, transitory strain \nrates associated with cracking of the adjacent outer carapace of the lava and the \nsudden vaporisation of external water. This is because the Hrafntinnuhryggur obsidian \nrequires stresses of several hundred MPa to fail at the low strain rates relevant to lava \ndeformation (Tuffen et al. 2008b). Such high stresses cannot be easily attained by \nflow-related processes alone in such small, shallow lava bodies. \n \n4.3.3. Vesiculated lithophysae-rich obsidian (zone c) \n \nThe faulted and flow-banded obsidian zone envelops a lithophysae-bearing zone of \nvariably vesicular obsidian that is only locally observed and is of highly variable \nthickness, from <10 cm to >2 m. The best exposed examples, such as locality BV, \noccur on the eastern flank. Spherical lithophysae ~1-7 cm across, which consist of \ntessellating hexagonal clusters of radiating feldspar and quartz crystals around a \ncentral void, are present in variable proportions, typically comprising 5-10 % of the \nrock volume (Fig. 9a). They occur in both black and blue-grey-brown banded \nobsidian, which is locally strongly vesiculated, and both overprint and deflect flow \nbands. Vesicles are predominantly near-spherical but may be strongly sheared, show a \nlimited range of sizes (mostly 1-10 mm) and make up 5-50 % of the obsidian volume. \nLocally clasts of vesicle-rich, lithophysae-free obsidian may appear within \nlithophysae-bearing bubble-free obsidian, whereas elsewhere the vesicle-rich obsidian \nappears to have been shattered and then healed (at AO, Fig. 9b). In a number of \nlocalities close to the ridge crest (e.g. O shown on Fig. 2, Fig. 9c) the lithophysae-rich \nobsidian appears to have been invaded by veins of bright red collapsed foam. \nElsewhere, the lithophysae-bearing zone occurs as intrusive veins within spherulitic \nobsidian of the lava interior (Fig. 5, Fig. 9d).  \n \n4.3.4. Spherulitic inner zone (zone d) \n \nBy far the largest portion of the majority of the lava bodies consists of spherulitic \nobsidian. Spherical intergrowths of radiating feldspar, quartz and magnetite ranging \nfrom <0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and comprising up to 100 % of the rock volume. Like \nthe lithophysae, the spherulites both overprint and deflect flow banding, indicating a \nrange of temperatures of formation that spans the glass transition interval (Monecke et \nal. 2004, Castro et al. in press). The spherulitic lava may vary from massive to banded \non centimetre to metre scales, and commonly contains irregularly spaced, folded veins \nof spherulite-free and sometimes lithophysae-bearing banded obsidian, between 1 cm \nand 1 m in width (AH on Fig. 2, Fig. 10a). Vesicularity is mostly low, but may reach \n20-30 vol. % in some localities. Fracture in the lava mostly occurs as sheets parallel to \nflow banding structures. At one outcrop striations on exposed platy fracture surfaces \nare consistent with slip on internal shear surfaces delineated by variably spherulitised \nflow bands in the lava (locality AJ on Fig. 2, Fig. 10b). The fractures are therefore \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nthought to be syn-emplacement structures formed during late-stage movement of the \ncooling lava bodies. \nThe interior of one lava body, approximately located at the centre of the ridge \n(Fig. 2) is microcrystalline rather than spherulitic, and coincides with the zone of \nmaximum etching, zeolite growth and hydrothermal alteration.  \n \n4.3.5. Interpretation of textural zones a-d \n \nThe range of textures observed reflects variations in cooling rate that were largely \ncontrolled by proximity to the lava margin, and the cooling effects of external water. \nAlthough poorly exposed, the quenched, fractured carapace associated with \nfragmental material bears close resemblance to the outer carapace of subglacially \nerupted rhyolitic lava bodies at Torfaj\u00f6kull that were intruded within quench \nhyaloclastite and formed during effusive subglacial eruptions (Furnes et al. 1980, \nTuffen et al. 2001, Tuffen et al. 2008a). The origin of the flow-banded and faulted \nzone is more enigmatic. Flow bands appear to have primarily formed through the \nductile strain of variably vesicular melt, some of which collapsed to form dense \nobsidian. The relationship between the spherulitic and lithophysal zones is interpreted \nas follows: crystallisation of spherulites in the lava interior released latent heat that \nled to remobilisation and secondary vesiculation of melt (Tuffen & Castro, 2008). \nThis led to the intrusion of veins of melt from spherulitic lava interiors towards the \nchilled lava margins. In these veins lithophysae crystallised rather than spherulites. \nExactly why this occurred is not obvious but may reflect a lower degree of \nundercooling, due to latent heat release, and a smaller number of nucleation sites. \nVein intrusion and heating may have played a role in fracturing the lava margins, \nallowing ingress of external water and triggering steam-driven explosions that \nshattered high-temperature melt. \nAlternatively, the lithophysal zones could represent an advanced stage of \nspherulite crystallization, whereby hydrous solute rejection from the growing \nspherulites builds up enough of a concentration gradient of water around the \nspherulite that \u201cback diffusion\u201d of H2O occurs into the spherulite (Wright 1915), \ncausing it to vesiculate and rupture into a lithophysa.  \n The orientation of flow banding structures within lava bodies is steeply \ndipping and consistent with budding of small lava flows and dome-like bodies from \nthe feeder dyke, a transition that is well exposed only at the southern end of the ridge. \nFink (1983) and Sampson (1987) similarly noticed that flow banding in the vent areas \nof subaerial obsidian flows is near-vertical, indicating feeding from depth and limited \nviscous gravitational spreading.  \n \n4.3.6. Pumiceous carapaces (zone e) \n \nAt several locations on the ridge crest (e.g. U, close to the 706 m summit of the ridge, \nFig. 2) the upper surface of the lava consists of >1 m of in-situ pumiceous material, \ncontaining >50 % and locally >70 % near-spherical bubbles. Pumiceous material may \nbe interbanded with denser obsidian. In many localities there is no intact carapace \npreserved but instead the ground is littered with pumiceous fragments. The most \nprominent and largest zones of pumiceous material occur at the highest parts of the \nridge, above 680 m elevation (Fig. 2).  \nSimilar finely vesicular carapaces occur on the outer surface of subaerial \nobsidian lavas (Fink 1983). Although the pumiceous zones at Hrafntinnuhryggur are \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nnot well preserved, their locally intact nature differentiates them from pyroclastic \nmaterial. Furthermore, the high vesicularity contrasts with the vesicle-free \nhyaloclastites found at lower elevations. The presence of delicate, easily-eroded \npumiceous material is evidence that 1) the upper part of the ridge pierced the ice \nsurface and was emplaced in an ice-contact but subaerial environment (Lescinsky & \nSisson 1998) and that 2) the upper part of the ridge escaped subsequent glacial \nerosion. In subglacial rhyolite sequences similar pumiceous carapaces have only been \nfound in the tuya-capping lava flows emplaced subaerially within ice cauldrons after \nthe ice surface was breached (Tuffen et al. 2002, Stevenson 2005).  \n \n4.3.7. Columnar-jointed flow sides (zone f) \n \nThe sides of lava bodies at 650-680 m elevation are commonly cut by prominent \ncolumnar joints. Their distribution is indicated in Fig 4 and the joints cut spherulitic \nlava of zone d containing up to 30 % vesicles. Joints occur in two main types: either \naligned normal to steeply-dipping outer surfaces (Fig. 11a, locality BR) or occurring \nas less well-organised splaying clusters of columns that radiate from depressions at \nthe top part of the lava sides (Fig. 11b, locality P). The first type of column cuts flow \nbands and vesicles at a variety of angles, is spaced typically ~7-12 cm but \nexceptionally 20 cm apart, and extends up to 3 m into the lava (Fig. 11a). The second \ntype of column may extend over >5 m, be strongly curved or branching, and is \npredominantly orientated normal to the upper surface of the lava and to flow \nstructures (Fig. 11b). Both types of columnar joint contrast with those found in the \nfeeder dyke, which are more hackly in appearance, more closely spaced, and oriented \nexclusively normal to the dyke walls and flow structures in the obsidian (Fig. 6).  \n The development of sets of joints normal to steeply-dipping cooling surfaces \nhas become used as a diagnostic indicator of quenching of lava against an ice wall \n(Lescinsky & Sisson 1998, Lescinsky & Fink 2000, Tuffen et al. 2002b). The \nconfinement of these textures to elevations between 650 and 680 m elevation may \nindicate that the ice surface was at around 680 m elevation, consistent with the \npumiceous subaerial flow-top facies found above this elevation. The splaying sets of \ncolumnar joints more closely resemble the entablature jointing found in the upper tier \nof river-cooled basaltic lava flows (e.g. Lyle 2000), and are thought to indicate \ncooling by water running over the surface of the deforming lava body prior to \ncomplete solidification.  \n \n4.3.8 Basal facies (zone g) \n \nThe contact between a lava body and the bedrock (basaltic hyaloclastite) is exposed at \n~660 m elevation, 150 SE of the southern summit of the ridge (Fig. 12; locality AP on \nFig. 2). Here, the south-east margin of an otherwise poorly-exposed lava body crops \nout along a ~50 m long series of low cliffs (Fig. 12a). The upper parts of the lava are \npervasively columnar-jointed (Fig. 12b), with gently-inclined joint orientations \nindicative of quenching against a static ice wall (e.g. Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998). In \ncontrast, the lower parts of the lower flow (Fig. 12c) are draped on the steeply-\ninclined (~20\u00b0 dipping), eroded bedrock of basaltic hyaloclastite. At the contact there \nis no obvious quench-fractured selvage in the tightly flow-folded obsidian flow and \nno cooling joints are present, whilst there is a ~10 cm thick baked zone in the basaltic \nhyaloclastite.  \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \n This combination of features is thought to indicate lava emplacement into a \nsteep, well-drained bergschrund-like cavity, with minimal meltwater retention. The \nupper parts of the lava quenched against a static ice wall, whilst the lava base flowed \nover \u201cdry\u201d bedrock (shown schematically in Fig. 12d). An alternative but unlikely \nexplanation is that the lava was intruded as a sill-like body at the ice-bedrock interface \n(e.g. Wilson & Head 2002) but this cannot readily explain the lack of meltwater- or \nice-related cooling joints at the lava base.  \n \n5. Obsidian geochemistry \n5.1. Major element composition \n \nMicroprobe analyses on glasses were carried out to investigate the extent of \ncompositional variability in Hrafntinnuhryggur magma. Glasses are aphyric tholeiitic \nrhyolites, with abundant microlites of clinoferrosilite and magnetite that are \npredominantly <1 \u00b5m across. Three samples were analysed, whose localities are \nshown in Fig. 2: S11b, a loose black obsidian block from locality E on the western \nflank near the southern end of the ridge, N9a from locality P on the northern crest of \nthe ridge (vesiculated lithophysae-rich obsidian from zone c), and S37c from locality \nAO on the east flank (faulted flow-banded obsidian from zone b). Analyses were \ncarried out at the University of Edinburgh, using a 4 nA current, 20 kV accelerating \nvoltage, and a beam defocused to 10 microns in order to minimise sodium loss.  \n Results for all species analysed (Table 2) are identical to within analytical \nerror, indicating that the Hrafntinnuhryggur magma is homogenous. There was no \nsignificant difference found between the major element composition of different \ncoloured flow bands in zone b or between zones of bright red collapsed pumice and \nsurrounding black obsidian from zone c, indicating that the range of textures and \ncolours present must reflect diverging cooling, degassing or redox conditions rather \nthan bulk compositional differences. \nAccording to Jonasson (1994), the Hrafntinnuhryggur rhyolite was generated \nby extraction of partial (~10%), near-liquidius melts from hydrothermally altered \ntholeiitic basalt, which is likely to have occurred at the margins of the shallow basaltic \nmagma chamber. Coexisting phase compostions in other Krafla rhyolites indicate \nmagma temperatures of 850-950 \u00b0C.  \n \n5.2. Glass water content \n \nH\n2\nO concentrations were determined by synchotron Fourier-transform infra-\nred spectroscopy (SFTIR) at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory, USA. Measurements were made on doubly-polished wafers (~40-400 \nmicrons thick) sectioned from bulk samples collected along the ridge axis. We \ncollected spectra on 3-10 spots per wafer with a Thermo Nicolet Magna 760 FTIR \nspectrometer interfaced with a NicPlan IR microscope (at beamline 1.4.3). The SFTIR \nbeam has a diffraction-limited diameter of about 3 \u00b5m. The uncertainty in spot \nposition is + 2 \u00b5m. Transmittance spectra were obtained over the mid-IR (1,400-4,000 \ncm-1) to the near-IR (3,700-6,500 cm\n-1\n) regions with MCT detectors, KBr beam-\nsplitters, and the synchotron light source. 128 scans were used to obtain each \nspectrum and these spectra were corrected by subtracting a background spectrum \ncollected every hour. We determined OH\n- \nconcentrations from the intensity of the \nbroad 3,570 cm\n-1 \nabsorption band, utilizing an absorption coefficient of 100 L \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nmol\u2022cm\n-1 \n(Newman et al. 1986). We estimate the analytical uncertainty of OH- \nconcentration to be + 10% of the measured value. As dissolved water is dominated by \nhydroxyl ions at the low water concentrations [OH-] is assumed to equate to [H2OT]. \nResults are reported in Table 3.  \n \n6. Discussion \n \n6.1. Magma-ice interaction at Hrafntinnuhryggur and palaeo-ice thickness \n \nThe eruption at Hrafntinnuhryggur appears to have involved comparatively little \ninteraction with meltwater. Evidence for magma-water interaction is confined to the \npresence of a small volume of quench-fragmented breccias and minor perlitic \nalteration around some lava margins. This contrasts with more pervasive magma-\nmeltwater interaction during rhyolitic eruptions beneath considerably thicker ice (e.g. \nTuffen et al. 2001; 2008a). Although exposure of fragmental lithologies is poor, there \nis no evidence for reworking of clastic material by meltwater or for erosion of \nbedrock by eruption-generated meltwater, unlike eruptions under thicker ice (Tuffen \net al. 2001, 2002a and 2008a). The apparently dry bedrock encountered by the base of \none lava body indicated that a sub-ice cavity was very well drained due to the steep \nbedrock slope.  \n The ice surface elevation during the eruption can be roughly estimated using \nthe highest elevation ice-contact columnar joints as a minimum and the lowest \nelevation of the pumiceous flow-top facies (inferred to be subaerial) as a maximum. \nThis yields elevations of 680-685 m on the northern part of the ridge and 670-690 m \non the southern part. If we make the major assumptions that the ice surface was \napproximately horizontal around the dyke, the bedrock surface was approximately \nhorizontal under the ridge and that little bedrock erosion has occurred after the \neruption, this yields ice thicknesses of 45-50 m (northern part of the ridge) and 35-55 \nm (southern part). The dyke exposure at the southern limit of the ridge has certainly \nundergone considerable post-eruptive erosion and crops out ~75-95 m beneath the \ninferred ice surface, although ~ 40 m of this may be now-removed bedrock. As \ndirectly to the south the current bedrock elevation plunges steeply to under 500 m, the \nice nearby may have been considerably thicker, facilitating erosion of the southern \npart of the ridge during any minor phase of re-advance. \nObsidian from the quenched margins of lava bodies contains 0.10-0.23 wt % \nH2O, whereas a sample from the dyke at locality I contains 0.37 wt % H2O. These \nresults show degassing to near-atmospheric pressure in the majority of the lava \nbodies. The solubility pressure for 0.37 wt % H2O of 13 bar (calculated using \nVolatileCalc, Newman & Lowenstern 2002, assuming carbon dioxide had entirely \ndegassed) corresponds to 66 m of bedrock (basaltic hyaloclastite with a density of \n~1900 kg m-3) or 190 m of firn at 700 kg m-3. Given that the inferred ice surface on \nthis part of the ridge was only 75-95 m above the level of dyke exposure, the loading \nwas probably predominantly due to overlying bedrock, with a small contribution from \nthe weight of firn. This inference is consistent with our estimate that ~40 m of \nbedrock was removed from above the exposed dyke by erosion. \n The inferred range of ice thicknesses (35-55 m) falls close to the normal range \nof firn thicknesses for temperate ice sheets (40-70 m, Paterson 1994), making it likely \nthat the eruption encountered firn rather than ice. As firn is highly permeable and \ndeforms much more slowly than ice, this inference is consistent with evidence for \nhighly efficient meltwater drainage and the lack of evidence for any meltwater \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \naccumulation. Nonetheless, firn is sufficiently competent to divert and mould \nadvancing lava, as demonstrated during the 1983 Klyuchevskoi eruption (Vinogradov \n& Murav\u2019ev 1988). Thus, if the Hrafntinnuhryggur eruption did encounter firn rather \nthan ice, it appears that lava-firn contact features are more similar to those of lava-ice \ncontact than those formed when lavas encounter snow (c.f. Mee et al. 2006). Studies \nof basaltic sequences erupted under thin ice (Mt Pinafore; Smellie et al. 1993, Smellie \n& Skilling 1994) concluded that the permeable nature of the ice\/firn would allow \nmeltwater to escape more easily than if the ice were thicker and subglacial drainage \nchannels were closed more rapidly by ice plasticity. We reach a similar conclusion \nhere and contrast the Hrafntinnuhryggur eruption with that of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur, Torfaj\u00f6kull \nwhere much more interaction with meltwater occurred, and oversteepening of the \nedifice against surrounding ice led to flank instability (Tuffen et al. 2001). \n A schematic cartoon showing the inferred eruption mechanisms is provided in \nFig. 13. The ratio of lavas to fragmental deposits is not known due to the strong bias \nin exposure towards lava lithologies and uncertainties about the topography of \nbedrock underlying the ridge. \n \n6.2. Timescale of the eruption and meltwater generation \n \nThe approximate timescale of the eruption can be estimated using the calculation by \nHoskuldsson & Sparks (1997) for buoyant rise of rhyolitic magma in a dyke through \nthe Icelandic crust. The magma discharge rate Q is then given by the following \nequation (modified from Hoskuldsson & Sparks 1997 eq. 7): \n\u00b5\n\u03c1\u03c1\n3\n)(2 3 dmc xghQ \u2212=  \nwhere \u03c1c is mean crustal density over the dyke length (2700 kg m-3), \u03c1m is magma \ndensity (2300 kg m-3), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m s-2), h is the dyke \nhalf-width in m, xd is the dyke length in m and \u00b5 is the magma shear viscosity in Pa s. \nThe average aspect ratio (xd\/2h) of rhyolitic dykes in Iceland is estimated at 500 \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson 1983). Given that Hrafntinnuhryggur is 2.5 km in length, if we \nassume that the eruption occurred from one continuous dyke of this length, a width \n(2h) of 5 m is expected. The exposed dyke, with thickness >2 m at the southern part \nof the ridge, was probably close to the tip of the dyke and so may be narrower than \nthe majority of the dyke, so a value of 5 m is appropriate. \nHoskuldsson & Sparks assumed that magma viscosity lay between 106 and 107 \nPa s. To check this we have used the latest model for the viscosity of magmatic \nliquids (Giordano et al. 2008), which accounts for major element composition and \nwater content of the magma. Using the measured Hrafntinnuhryggur melt \ncomposition, and assuming a magma temperature of 900 \u00b0C, we find that viscosities \nof 106, 107 and 108 Pa s require water contents of 1.5, 0.62 and 0.18 wt % \nrespectively. If we assume that the melt was water-saturated during shallow ascent \n(reasonable due to the presence of vesicles) and use published solubility-pressure \nrelationships (Newman & Lowenstern 2002), these water content values transpose to \ndepths of 755, 136 and 11 m respectively. If we further assume that magma rise is \nlargely controlled by processes in the top ~200 m of the dyke, where viscosity rapidly \nincreases due to degassing, we must therefore consider the controlling viscosity range \nto be between 107 and 108 Pa s. This range of magma viscosity corresponds well with \nestimates of the Newtonian viscosity of flow lobes of the Namshraun rhyolite lava at \nTorfaj\u00f6kull (Wilson et al. 2007) but exceeds that suggested by Hoskuldsson & Sparks \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \n(1997). It yields magma discharge rates of 1-10 m3 s-1 (dyke width 5 m), which \ncorrespond to eruption timescales of 2-20 months for the ridge as a whole. \n Although there is considerable uncertainty in the magma discharge rate, there \nbeing no subaerial flow lobes whose morphology can be used to infer emplacement \ntimescales (c.f. Wilson et al. 2007), what is clear is that the meltwater flux would \nhave been negligible. If we assume that ~75 % of the erupted magma transferred its \nheat to the surrounding firn (which may be an overestimate) and that magma-firn or \nice heat transfer was 100 % efficient (also unlikely) this yields a rate of meltwater \ngeneration of only 7-70 m3 s-1. As there is no evidence for meltwater accumulation in \nthe vent area, the magnitude of any eruption-triggered j\u00f6kulhlaup was therefore orders \nof magnitude smaller than the Gj\u00e1lp or more recent Kverkfj\u00f6ll j\u00f6kulhlaups \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 1997, Rushmer 2006).  \n \n6.3. The eruption mechanism and influence of firn\/ice \n \nGiven the limited interaction between magma and firn\/meltwater, with little \nhyaloclastite generated, we believe that the eruption mechanisms were not \nsignificantly affected by the surrounding firn\/ice. If no firn or ice had been present \nduring the eruption, it is likely to have formed a number of small lava flow lobes \nemanating from a number of discrete vents along a fissure row (e.g. Namshraun and \nother similar subaerial rhyolitic lava flows at Torfaj\u00f6kull; McGarvie 1984, Wilson et \nal. 2007). The main effect of the firn\/ice was to constrain the advance of lava bodies \nand cause the formation of a steep-sided ridge. The explosive phase of the eruption is \nlikely to have shattered the thin roof of overlying firn\/ice, rather than having been \nconstrained within a strong ice-walled cavity (c.f. Tuffen et al. 2008a). This shattering \nwould have been assisted by firn\/ice fracture during the initial rifting event (Wilson & \nHead 2002). We can therefore conclude that small-volume effusive eruptions of \nrhyolitic lava from beneath thin ice are unlikely to involve significant explosive \nmagma-meltwater interaction or generate powerful j\u00f6kulhlaups, unless the bedrock \ntopography favours accumulation of meltwater around the vent. \nIf the eruption had occurred under much thicker ice, where meltwater could \nhave been abundant, would the eruption have been explosive or intrusive? Using the \ncalculations in Tuffen (2007) for evolving cavity and edifice sizes during fissure \neruptions under 600 m ice, we find that the low magma discharge rate at \nHrafntinnuhryggur (<10 m3s-1 magma) from a 2.5 km-long fissure plots firmly in the \nintrusive domain (Figure 4 of Tuffen, 2007). This is where cavity growth is slower \nthan edifice growth, so that the cavity becomes entirely filled with erupted debris and \nthere is limited scope for explosive magma-meltwater interaction. We therefore infer \nthat, if the eruption had occurred under thicker ice, it was also have been effusive in \nnature, and may have formed similar lava lobe-quench hyaloclastite facies to those \nfound at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (Tuffen et al. 2001).  \n \n7. Conclusions  \n \nHrafntinnuhryggur was emplaced in a rhyolitic fissure eruption and formed a number \nof small-volume lava bodies together with minor fragmental material. The distribution \nof columnar jointing, quench hyaloclastite and subaerial pumiceous flow carapaces of \nlava bodies indicates that the eruption pierced the surface of ice only 35-55 m thick. \nThis thickness corresponds with that of permeable firn in temperature glaciers. There \nObsidian dyke through thin ice  Tuffen and Castro \nis no evidence for accumulation of meltwater and only minor interaction between \nmagma and meltwater occurred.  \nThe complex internal textural zonation of lava bodies is attributed to variable \nrates of cooling, deformation and degassing, which led to pervasive late-stage \ncrystallisation of lava interiors, with brittle-ductile deformation of outer zones. The \nwater content of erupted glasses indicates degassing to near-atmospheric pressures on \nthe ridge crest, whereas the feeder dyke is significantly more water-rich, with a \nsaturation pressure of 13 bars. Simple calculations suggest that the eruption duration \nwas probably between 2 and 20 months, and that the eruption could not have \ngenerated a significant j\u00f6kulhlaup. We show that the mechanisms of the eruption were \nprobably not greatly affected by the presence of such thin overlying ice, and contrast \nthe eruption of Hrafntinnuhryggur with rhyolitic eruptions beneath much thicker ice \nelsewhere, where the hazards from explosive activity and meltwater floods were much \ngreater. \n \n------------------------ \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are indebted to Orkust\u00f6fnun for allowing us to stay at Krafla power station during \nthe fieldwork, to the landowner for permission to work on the volcano, to Kristj\u00e1n \nJ\u00f3nasson for help with sampling permission, Harry Pinkerton and Lionel Wilson for \ndiscussions about lava emplacement, Anthony Newton for assistance with microprobe \nanalyses, and to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Leverhulme Trust and \nNERC for funding our research.
