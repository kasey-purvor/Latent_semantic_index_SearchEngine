Examples include lasers, pat-\ntern forming systems [1], trapped electrons which display\nbistability and switching in a strong periodic field [2], and\nspatially periodic systems (ratchets) which display a uni-\ndirectional current when driven by a nonthermal noise [3].\nIt was recognized by Onsager and Machlup [4] that an in-\nsight into the physics of large fluctuations can be gained\nfrom an analysis of the distribution of fluctuational paths\nalong which the system moves to a given state. This dis-\ntribution is a fundamental characteristic of the fluctuation\ndynamics, and its understanding paves the way to control-\nling the fluctuations. In the present Letter we show that, in\nsystems away from thermal equilibrium, the distribution of\nfluctuational paths generically displays critical behavior.\nFluctuational motion from the vicinity of the stable state\n(where the system spends most of its time) to a given state\nmay occur along different paths. For large fluctuations,\nthe distribution of these paths peaks sharply at the optimal\n(most probable) path, often called the Onsager-Machlup\noptimal path. In the theory of large fluctuations, the pattern\nof optimal paths plays a role similar to that of the phase\nportrait in nonlinear dynamics; we report below the first\nexperimental observations of this pattern.\nFor a system in thermal equilibrium with a bath with\na short correlation time, the optimal path to a given\nstate is the time-reversed path of the system from this\nstate to the vicinity of the stable state in the neglect of\nfluctuations (the deterministic path) [5]. This is no longer\ntrue for nonequilibrium systems, because they lack time\nreversibility. Even for simple nonequilibrium systems\nthe pattern of optimal paths, as well as the statistical\ndistribution [6], may have singular features.\nThe occurrence of singularities is clear from the formal\nanalogy between extreme fluctuational paths and extreme\npaths in quantum mechanics. Well-known singularities\nof the pattern of extreme paths in optics and quantum\nmechanics are caustics [7]. The wave function blows up0031-9007y96y77(26)y5229(4)$10.00on a caustic (as it does at a classical turning point, which\nis an analog of a caustic in the 1D case). In the general\ncase caustics start in pairs from a cusp point, also known\nas a focal point: see Fig. 1.\nCaustics and cusps in the pattern of extreme fluctuational\npaths have been found numerically in a number of papers\n[8,9], and some related analytical results were obtained in\n[9(c)], [10,11]. We note that, in the problem of fluctu-\nations, contributions to the probability distribution from\ndifferent paths are all positive, whereas the contributions\nto the transition amplitude in quantum mechanics are com-\nplex and it is their interference pattern that is actually ob-\nserved. Therefore the singularities in the pattern of optimal\nfluctuational paths differ from those known for the wave\nFIG. 1. Extreme paths of (1) for K \u00ad q 2 q3 1 0.264 3\ncos 1.2t.

The data points show the maxima\nof the prehistory probability distribution measured for three\nfinal points away from the cusp. Reduced variances of the\ncorresponding Gaussian distributions s2 (displaced along the\nordinate axis for clarity) are compared with the theory in\nthe inset.\u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society 5229\nVOLUME 77, NUMBER 26 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 23 DECEMBER 1996fields [11]. In particular, optimal fluctuational paths do\nnot encounter caustics, but they do focus into cusp points.\nUse of the prehistory probability density [12] (see below)\nenables us to set the subject on an experimental footing. It\nalso makes it possible to reveal and analyze, theoretically\nand experimentally, singular behavior of the distribution of\nfluctuational paths.\nWe investigate singular features of the paths distribu-\ntion using as an example the simplest possible system\nwhere these features may arise: an overdamped Brown-\nian particle driven by a periodic force Ksq; td and white\nnoise jstd, with the equation of motion\n\u00d9q \u00ad Ksq; td 1 jstd, Ksq; td \u00ad Ksq; t 1 Td ,\nkjstdjst0dl \u00ad Ddst 2 t0d .\n(1)\nThe model (1) applies to a wide range of physical systems\nand has attracted much attention recently, cf. [13,14],\nparticularly in the context of stochastic resonance [15].\nFor small D, within a relaxation time tr the system (1)\nwill approach the stable periodic state qs0dstd,\n\u00d9qs0d \u00ad Ksqs0d; td, qs0dst 1 Td \u00ad qs0dstd , (2)\nand a periodic stationary probability distribution will be\nformed in the basin of attraction to this state (transitions\nbetween stable states will not be considered here; we also\nlimit the discussion to period-one stable states).\nThe distribution of paths for large fluctuations can be\ninvestigated and visualized through the analysis of the\nprehistory probability density, phsq, t j qf , tfd [12]. This\nis the conditional probability density for a system that had\nbeen fluctuating about qs0dstd for a time greatly exceeding\ntr , and arrived to the point qf at the instant tf , to have\npassed through the point q at the instant t st , tfd. It can\nbe written as a path integral:\nphsq, t j qf , tfd \u00ad C\nZ qstf d\u00adqf\nqstid\u00f8qs0dstid\nD qst0d exp\n\u2022\n2\nSfqstdg\nD\n\u201a\n3 dfqstd 2 qg, ti ! 2\u2018 ,Z\ndqphsq, t j qf , tfd \u00ad 1 , (3)\nwhere C is the normalization constant.\nThe functional Sfqg determines the probability distribu-\ntion over the paths of a Markovian system. To lowest or-\nder in the noise intensity D it takes the form of the action\nfunctional for an auxiliary dynamical system with the La-\ngrangian Ls \u00d9q, q; td (cf. [16]):\nSfqstdg \u00ad\nZ tf\nti\ndt Ls \u00d9q, q; td ,\nLs \u00d9q, q; td \u00ad\n1\n2\nf \u00d9q 2 Ksq; tdg2. (4)\nClearly, the formulations (3) and (4) are similar to the path-\nintegral expression for the appropriate transition amplitude\nin quantum mechanics [17], with \" replaced by 2iD.\nThe optimal fluctuational path qoptst j qf , tfd along\nwhich the system arrives at the point qf at the instant\ntf is the path that provides the minimum to Sfqstdg. It is5230given by the solution of the variational problem\ndSfqg\ndqstd\n\u00ad 0, qoptstf j qf , tfd \u00ad qf ,\nqoptsti j qf , tfd ! qs0dstid for ti ! 2\u2018 .\n(5)\nIn fact, Eq. (5) describes extreme fluctuational paths.\nOptimal paths provide the global minimum to the action\nSfqg. It is clear from (3) that for small D it is these\noptimal paths that are of physical significance. Extreme\npaths qstd as given by (4) and (5) can intersect each\nother, and the dynamical system with the time-dependent\nLagrangian (4) is nonintegrable. In contrast, generically\nonly one optimal path can arrive at a given point.\nThe physical meaning of the prehistory probability den-\nsity ph (3) becomes clear if one expands the coordinate\nqstd into the orthonormal functions cnstd which diagonal-\nize the second variation of the action,\nqstd \u00ad qoptst j qf , tfd 1\nX\nn\nancnstd . (6)\nIt follows from (4) that the functions cnstd satisfy a\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type equation\n2c\u00a8n 1 V stdcn \u00ad lncn ,\nV std \u00ad\n\u2022\n\u203a2K\n\u203aq\u203at\n1\n1\n2\n\u203a2K2\n\u203aq2\n\u201a\nopt\n, (7)\nwith the boundary conditions cnstid \u00ad cnstfd \u00ad 0 [in (7)\nthe derivatives of K ; Ksq; td are evaluated for q \u00ad\nqoptst jqf , tfd].\nFor trajectories qstd close to the optimal path, the an\nin (6) are small, and the action Sfqstdg is quadratic in an\n[unless sqf , tfd is close to the cusp; see below],\nSfqstdg \u00ad Ssqf , tfd 1 sshanjd, sshanjd \u00ad\n1\n2\nX\nn\nlna\n2\nn ,\nSsqf , tfd ; Sfqoptst j qf , tfdg .\n(8)\nIf one writes the path integral (3) as an integral over all\nan and substitutes Eqs. (6) and (8) into (3), one obtains\nphsq, t j qf , tfd \u00ad M exp\n\u02c6\n2\nfq 2 qoptst j qf , tfdg2\n2Ds2st j qf , tfd\n!\n,\ns2st j qf , tfd \u00ad\nX\nn\nl21n c\n2\nnstd, M \u00ad s2pDs\n2d21y2.\n(9)\nIt is seen from (9) that, near the maximum, the\ndistribution ph is Gaussian in the distance of the point\nsq, td from the optimal path qoptst j qf , tfd (cf. [12]).\nTherefore by investigating ph one can find directly the\noptimal path itself, and also analyze the shape of the tube\nof paths arriving at a given point sqf , tfd. Away from the\ncusp point, the width of this tube is ~D1y2.\nThe reduced width of the distribution (9) sst j qf , tfd\nis given by the Green function of (7) at zero energy. For\nan arbitrary periodic force K in (1) its evaluation reduces\nVOLUME 77, NUMBER 26 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 23 DECEMBER 1996to the solution of an ordinary differential equation\ns2st j qf , tfd \u00ad\nZ tf\nt\ndt1 exp\n\"\n22\nZ t1\nt\ndt2 bst2d\n#\n,\n\u00d9b 1 b2 \u00ad V std , (10)\nbstid \u00ad bsti 1 T d for ti ! 2\u2018 .\nClearly, sst j qf , tfd is independent of qf , tf for tf 2\nt \u00c0 tr : it gives the reduced width of the stationary\nGaussian distribution about qs0dstd. Experiments on an\nanalog electronic model of (1), based on a standard\ntechnique [18], have yielded results which are in very\ngood agreement with Eqs. (5) and (10); see Fig. 1.\nThe only generic structurally stable singularities of the\npattern of extreme paths of Sfqg (4) are caustics and\ncusps [19]. Since caustics may not be observed in the\npattern of optimal paths [11], it is particularly interesting\nto investigate the distribution ph near cusp points. At the\ncusp sqc, tcd one of the eigenvalues ln becomes equal to\nzero [7] (we set l0 \u00ad 0). Equation (9) does not apply if\nthe final point sqf , tfd is close to sqc, tcd; in particular, s\ndiverges for l0 \u00ad 0. We now present results for the case\nwhere the final point is precisely the cusp.\nAt the cusp point it is necessary [7] to keep in the\nexpansion of the action s (8) the higher-order terms in\nthe amplitude a0 of the \u201csoft mode\u201d c0std ; cc0std ~\nexpf\nRt dt0bst0dg:\nscshanjd \u00f8\n1\n4\ng0a\n4\n0 1\n1\n2\nX\nn.0\nlna\n2\nn 1\n1\n2\na20\nX\nn.0\ngnan .\n(11)\nIf we change to integration over the coefficients an in the\npath integral (3), and integrate over all an.0 with account\ntaken of Eqs. (8) and (11) we obtain the prehistory\nprobability distribution for the paths coming to the cusp\npoint in the form\nphsq, t j qc, tcd \u00ad Mc\nZ \u2018\n2\u2018\nda0 expf2F sa0 j qc, tcdyDg\n3 exp\n\"\n2\nfq 2 qoptst j qc, tcd 2 a0cc0stdg2\n2Ds2c st j qc, tcd\n#\n, (12)\nF sa0 j qc, tcd \u00ad 14 ga\n4\n0, g \u00ad g0 2\n1\n2\nX\nn.0\nl21n g\n2\nn .\nThe function s2c in (12) is given by Eq. (9) with the term\nn \u00ad 0 being eliminated from the sum; Mc ; Mcstd is a\nnormalization constant.\nVery close to the cusp point, i.e., for very small\nstc 2 td the shape of the distribution (12) is dominated\nby diffusion, so that the distribution is Gaussian; the term\na0cc0 can be neglected, and scstd \u00f8 stc 2 td1y2.\nFor larger stc 2 td we have from (12)\nphsq, t j qc, tcd \u00ad M\u02dcc exp\n(\n2\ng\n4D\n3\n\u2022\nq 2 qoptst j qc, tcd\ncc0std\n\u201a4)\n,\ntr * tc 2 t \u00c0 D1y2g1y2y \u00d9c2c0stcd . (13)Equation (13) shows that, at the critical point, fluctuations\nabout the optimal path become strongly non-Gaussian,\nand the prehistory probability distribution can be used\nto reveal the critical behavior of the fluctuational paths.\nThe characteristic width of the distribution (13) is ,D1y4,\nand its shape is determined by the soft mode cc0std.\nThis mode is localized within the range tc 2 t & tr .\nFor tc 2 t \u00c0 tr the distribution (12) goes over into the\nstationary Gaussian distribution about the attractor qs0dstd.\nThe measured and calculated evolutions of the distribution\nwith stc 2 td are in good agreement: see Fig. 2. Critical\nbehavior of the distribution of paths coming to a cusp\npoint is much more pronounced than that of the statistical\ndistribution near a cusp, where it is seen primarily in a\nblowing up of the prefactor [9(c)], [11].\nThe above analysis can be generalized to describe\ncritical broadening of the prehistory distribution for the\nfinal point close to the cusp. It can also be shown that,\nas in the case of stationary systems [11], a switching line\nemanates from the cusp point. This line separates regions\nof the sq, td plane which are reached along different\nsets of optimal paths. On this line the logarithm of\nthe stationary probability distribution is nondifferentiable\nin the limit D ! 0; the singularity shown to occur in\nnonequilibrium systems by Graham and T\u00e9l [13]. Its\nposition is determined by equality of the probabilities to\nreach it along optimal paths arriving from opposite sides.\nIt can be explicitly found in special cases [9(a)], [10(a)].\nFor sqf , tfd lying close to the switching line [and\nfar enough from sqc, tcd], the prehistory distribution\nshould have two ridges centered at the optimal paths\nq\ns1,2d\nopt st j qf , tfd which intersect each other at sqf , tfd.\nFIG. 2.

(9), with the\nnormalization factors ~exps2Sfqs1,2dopt gyDd, respectively.\nThe resultant corral formed by the ridges as measured in\nthe experiment is shown in Fig. 3.\nWe note that the optimal paths \u201cdie\u201d on the switching\nlines: the extreme paths which provide a solution to\nEqs. (5) are no longer optimal at the distance \u00c0D1y2\nbeyond the switching line. In particular, as is clear from\nFigs. 1 and 3 they are not optimal when they encounter\ncaustics, and thus caustics are not seen directly in the\nprehistory probability density (cf. [11]).\nObservation of the pattern of optimal paths and of\ncritical effects is possible because, for classical fluctuation\nprocesses, we can establish how the system had been\nmoving before its arrival in a given state. This contrasts\nwith quantum mechanics, where e.g., observation of a\npath passing through a slit destroys the interference in\na two-slit experiment. We note that the Landau theory\nof critical behavior applies exactly to the present system,\nsince the soft mode is localized and there is a gap between\nits energy and the energies of other modes.\nIn conclusion, we have used the prehistory probability\ndistribution to analyze singular features of the pattern of\noptimal fluctuational paths in systems away from thermal\nequilibrium. We have predicted and observed critical\nbroadening of the distribution of paths arriving in the\nvicinity of cusp points, and we have also observed a\nswitching line in the pattern of optimal paths.\nThe work was supported in part by the Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council (UK) and by the\nRussian Foundation for Basic Research.5232*Permanent address: Institute of Metrological Service,\nAndreevskaya Nab.
