The currencies of the EU-8 that will be \nstudied are of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and \nSlovakia, daily, from 2005 to 2008.  \n \nDesign\/Methodology \nContagion is said to be revealed if there are greater links after August 2007 compared \nwith before. The links or bonds are revealed by the number of cointegrating vectors \nand the extent of Granger-causality that exists among the currencies. The role of the \nEuro is also identified using the same techniques. \n \nFindings \nThe bonds between these seven countries strengthen after the beginning of the \nbanking crisis compared with before, whilst the ties with the Euro remains stable.  \n \nResearch limitations\/implications \nA banking crisis not directly related to the EU-8 spilled over to a change in the \ncorrelations among their currencies. If the EU requires convergence of emerging with \ndeveloped markets before currency assimilation, research is needed to explore how a \n 1\nrecord of financial rectitude can be demonstrated whilst recognising that contagion is \nmore likely to affect those emerging markets and information deficiencies.   \n \nPractical Implications \nFirst, the EU should reconsider the entry requirements for the EU-8 still disqualified \nfrom joining the Euro. The protected 2 year period of displaying financial rectitude \nvia targeting the Euro before accession is considered may now appear a burden that to \ngreat for small economies to bear. Second, it is not necessarily a crisis that changes \nthe rewards from diversification, contagion may also do this. \n \nOriginality\/value \nThe finding of increased bonding among emerging market currencies precipitated by \na banking crisis in related geographical and financial markets, before a local crisis \nbecame evident is novel.  \n \nKey words Contagion, EU-8, Foreign Exchange Rates, Cointegration, Granger-\ncausality \n \nPaper Type Research Paper \n 2\nIntroduction \nModern portfolio theory advocates that investors should manage risk through \ndiversification across a variety of assets (Cuthbertson, 1996). Dispersing investments \nacross two assets that are not perfectly correlated should reduce risk exposure. \nDiversification in asset types is based on the view that each is a function of a \ndistinctive group of variables (Hoesli et al., 1997). So, for example, diversification in \nproperty types is based on the presumption that each is a function of a distinctive \ngroup of variables: business services drive office rents; industrial performance affects \nindustrial rents; and consumer demand influences retail rents. Thus, the market \ndrivers should be different.  \nThe credit crunch\/banking crisis of 2007\/8 entailed excessive lending in the \nUS sub-prime market plus the marketing and miss-rating of complex debt instruments \nby western financial institutions. The timeline of events in the credit crisis (Bank of \nEngland, 2008) shows evidence of some financial distress, particularly relating to \nBear Sterns, but the key announcement made on 9 8 07 of BNP Paribus suspending \nthree sub-prime money market funds and the European Central Bank injecting \u20ac95bn \nto boost liquidity in the banking sector was the marker of a change. The London \ninterbank lending system essentially fails to operate from this time on, precipitating, \nwithin a month, the first run on a British bank for over a century. This crisis might \nhave spilled over to other markets not directly affected, altering the basis for portfolio \ndiversification among these markets, including emergent European markets. \n The aim of this paper is to examine whether the banking crisis in the US and \nWestern Europe, that began in August 2007, spilled over to the currencies the EU-8 \nsuch that it could be viewed as financial contagion. The structure of the paper is as \nfollows. In the first section, there is a review of literature concerning emerging \n 3\nmarkets and financial contagion over numerous crises. This is followed by an outline \nof theoretical perspectives on contagion and then a review of the background or \nsetting of the study, including hypotheses. The data and the methodology are then \nreviewed. The results reveal that there has been a strengthening of links among the \nEU-8 both in the long and short runs, whilst the bond with the Euro remains. It is \nconcluded that financial contagion occurred from developed economy markets \ndirectly related to the crisis to emerging markets before a currency crisis hit one of the \nEU-8. \n \nEmerging Markets and Contagion \nPericoli and Sbracia (2003) suggest a financial crisis is usually related to a currency, a \nstock market or a banking crisis. Financial assts used in this regard includes bonds \n(e.g. Yang, 2005) currencies (e.g. AuYong et al., 2004) and stock markets (e.g. \nGilmore and McManus, 2002; Syriopoulos, 2007). Gilmore and McManus (2002) \nexplore whether emerging equity markets of markets of Central Europe are segmented \nfrom the US and, hence, provide scope for diversification. They undertake Granger-\ncausality and cointegration tests. As they find no cointegration and only one case of \nGranger-causality, they conclude that diversification is appropriate. \n In their study of Central European stock markets, Serwa and Bohl  \n(2005) point out that very few empirical studies have concentrated on contagion \namong these markets. The Russian crisis of 1998\/9 led to increased correlations \nacross Central European stock markets during the 1994\u20131999 period (Gelos and \nSahay, 2001) with market sentiment being a conduit (Darvas and Szap\u00e1ry, 2000). \n  Serwa and Bohl (2005) use the same approach as Forbes and Rigobon (2002) \nand Gelos and Sahay (2001) in examining the co-movement of stock index returns by \n 4\ncross-market correlation. They find that Central European stock markets are no more \nlikely to be subject to contagion than western stock markets over the 1997-2002 \nperiod. The Central European stock markets exhibit interdependence rather than \ncontagion. \n \nSplit Sample Analysis using Cointegration and Granger-causality \nWhilst exploring integration among eleven European and US stock markets, Yang et \nal. (2003) find that the establishing of European monetary union affected the \nintegration of both EMU and non-EMU markets. This is an example of a study that \nentails splitting the data into before and after an event to examine whether the event \nleft a mark upon the degree of integration among a number of financial markets. An \napproach to the investigation of shock analysis\/ contagion and integration involves the \nuse of cointegration with Granger-causality.  \nUsing stock market indices of emerging Central European and developed \nstock markets, as with Gilmore and McManus, Syriopoulos (2007), examines \nfinancial market links. He finds that they seem to be more strongly linked to the \nmarkets of the US and Germany as a result of membership of the EU. To achieve this, \nhe considers the stock markets of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, \nin the two years prior three, and three quarters, after the establishment of EMU on the \nFirst of January 99. Stock market interdependence is based on testing for \ncointegration and the number of vectors, analysing the relevant ECM, and considering \nthe speed of adjustment: greater interdependence is reflected in the number of vectors. \nIn contrast with Gilmore and McManus, he finds that there is one cointegrating vector \namong the six indices for both before and after EMU. This includes the US S&P500 \nand the German Dax. Finding that both the developed economy indices had non-zero \n 5\nloadings in the long run vector, Syriopoulos concludes that they both have a dominant \ninfluence on the emerging markets, which is line with Yang et al.. Although, the \nfinding of one vector in both periods suggests that there is no strengthening of links, it \ndoes indicate that portfolio diversification is less effective and that immunity to \nexternal shocks is limited by a long run relationship with other markets.  \nThe Granger-causality results for both the pre and post eras again suggest that \nboth the developed-economy indices have a dominant influence on the emerging \nmarkets. The post EMU period is characterised by weaker short run links among the \nemerging markets, with Slovakia, in particular, following a more autonomous path.  \nAlso exploring the impact of an event, AuYong et al. (2004) examine \ncontagion among foreign exchange markets of emerging and Asian economies. The \ndata, which is daily 14 countries\u2019 foreign exchange rates against the US Dollar from \n1994 to 2001, is divided into seven sub-samples. Each series is assessed in each sub-\nperiod for pairwise and multiple cointegration. The pairwise cointegration results \nsuggest major economies (Japan) and those close together Indonesia and Thailand) \nare cointegrated throughout, suggesting trade and proximity are important factors in \ncontagion. \nArranging the 14 currencies into four groups, AuYong et al. show how the \ndegree of integration, as measured by the number of cointegrating vectors, varies. For \nexample, the Asian currencies are cointegrated before the Mexican crisis of 1994\/5 \nbut are not found to be cointegrated again until the Russian crisis of 1998\/9.  \nThe Granger-causality tests also revealed instability in linkages. During the \ncrisis in that area, causality was found between countries with weak trading links and \nat a great distance from the Asian region. This may suggest relationships that can be \nrelated to the contagion rather than interaction that would provoke normal co-\n 6\nmovements. Given the level of inter and intra regional interaction indicated by either \nGranger-causality or cointegration, AuYong et al. suggest diversification on an \ninternational basis may be undermined particularly when they find that (real) trade \nlinks do not adequately explain causality relationships.   \nMasih and Masih (1997, 2004) examine the impact of the stock exchange \ncrash of October 1987. They find cointegration among six major stock markets (1997) \nand the five monthly European stock market indices (2004) both before and after the \ncrisis. They find only one vector in each period. In the 2004 paper, oddly, \ncointegration is not found across the entire period but this is not investigated in the \n1997 paper. Also in the 1997 paper, vector loadings are investigated. Only the French \nindex appears to have a zero loading in the long run vector.  \nThe Granger-causality results suggest that most links were altered. In the 1997 \npaper there were no significant links before the crash, which conflicts with the 2004 \npaper. Only the bond between Germany causing France was consistent across both \neras in the 2004 paper. Thus, the crash is found to have altered the bonds between \nmany markets. \n \nFinancial Crises and Contagion \nIn their review of contagious financial events, Kaminsky et al. (2003) highlight three \ncommon themes: first, an abrupt reversal of capital flows; second, an unanticipated \nannouncement that sets off a readjustment of portfolios; and third, leveraged common \ncreditors, such as commercial banks, help propagate the crisis across national borders. \nAll three appear evident in the credit crunch of 2007.  \nKaminsky et al. (2003) identify three groups of theories to explain contagion. \nThe first, herding, concerns an information-cascade, where individuals observe the \n 7\nbehaviour of those \u2018in front of them\u2019 and, without regard to their own information, \nfollow that. Indeed, where investors in portfolios face information asymmetries, the \ncosts of correcting these may outweigh the benefits, so herding is rational. Mimicking \nthe market portfolio is a prediction of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, so if other \ninvestors are divesting themselves of a country specific investment, so should you. \n The second, trade linkages, can be seen in a regional system of countries in a \nfixed exchange rate system with strong trade linkages among sub-group and one of \nthese devalues. The change in relative prices will put pressure on others in the sub-\ngroup to follow suit, such as the Portuguese Escudo devalued with the Spanish Peseta \nduring the ERM crisis of 1992. \n The third explanation of contagion is financial linkages. Rational investors \nwith non-performing assets in country-diversified portfolio may rebalance it by \nselling assets. As the assets that will be sold are unlikely to be the country where asset \nprices have collapse, the rebalancing will depress asset prices in other countries. \nBanks play an important role in this process as they call in loans in markets that are, \nas yet, unaffected by the contagion, in an effort to shore-up positions in their home \nmarket.  \n Pericoli and Sbracia (2003) present five definitions of contagions; the fifth, \n(shift) contagion, is relevant for the approach taken here. Shift contagion entails an \nintensification or change in the transmission of shocks between markets. This is a \nvariant on the third and fourth definitions, which relate to an intensification of the co-\nmovement of assets across markets. Shift contagion implies a structural break and the \nidentification of a tranquil, pre-event period. The key concern about contagion is that \nit undermines the very assumptions of portfolio analysis. Markets that were assumed \n(estimated to be) weakly associated before the event are subsequently found to be \n 8\nstrongly associated, so that diversification across these markets fails to shield the \ninvestor from unsystematic risk. \n \nA Macroeconomic Perspective  \nAs a group in 2006, the EU-8 had relatively low rates of household debt to income. \nHowever, the period from 2000-2006 had seen a high rate of growth of credit in \nLatvia and Estonia compared with the others whereas in Slovakia and the Czech \nRepublic it had fallen. Moreover, the external debt of banks and enterprises in Latvia \nand Estonia was also out of line with the others. But this difference may reflect macro \ntargets. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia pursue variants of \ninflation targeting, whereas Latvia targets exchange rate stability.  \nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia were members of the Central \nEuropean Free Trade Area until 2004, which should foster relatively strong trading \nbonds. In an exercise to examine financial stability in Europe and a single market in \nbanking, Garcia and Nieto (2007) estimate cross border bank asset holdings in the \nEuropean Economic Area. They find that the large western economies generally hold \na low level \u2013 certainly less than 25%. By contrast, of EU-8 analysed, the lowest \nproportion is just below 60% and Estonia is estimated at 100%. Clearly, the scope for \nfinancial contagion is greater in the EU-8 as a result. Moreover, Lithuania and Estonia \nin 2004 and Latvia and Slovakia in 2005 joined the so-called ERM11, the precursor to \njoining the Euro. In a speech given by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board \nof the ECB, in April 2005 suggested that ERM11, by requiring the adoption of a \nconsistent monetary and economic policy framework, fosters policy discipline \ntowards stability. It can help establish a stable macroeconomic environment and can \nact as a catalyst of structural reforms. Second, it can enhance policy credibility and \n 9\nhelp guide expectations. The central parity of a currency against the Euro provides \nguidance to foreign exchange markets and should contribute to greater exchange rate \nstability. Furthermore, this should constrain inflationary expectations, accelerating \ndisinflation and reduce inflation volatility. ERM11 should foster another link among \nthe currencies. \n Daianu and Lungu (2007) review the impact of inflation targeting on the \nCentral European economies of Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and \nthe Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The cost of accession to the EU in \n2004 has, Daianu and Lungu argue, pushed up inflation. Karam et al. (2008) might \nargue that this is a price worth paying, as smaller states are subject to more volatility \nthan larger ones. The problems of conflicting government goals and uncertainty about \nthe future making forecasting [and hence targeting] inflation challenging could breed \nuncertainty among speculators. This would undermine confidence in the central bank \n(Daianu and Lungu, 2007). Indeed, targeting both low inflation and exchange rate \nstability (as part of ERM11) implies a conflict of goals if the same instrument is used. \nOne would anticipate that, among the group, there would be at least one \ncointegrating vector, possibly, given the extent of the common borders and history, \nthere would be more. Moreover, given the banking linkages, bonds with Europe and \nthe accession to the Euro criteria, there is likely to be some contagion leading to more \nbonding as measured by cointegration and Granger-causality after the [news] event of \n9 8 08. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the foreign exchange rates (FX rates) are \nled, in the long run (Jones and Leishman) and short run (Granger-causality sense), by \nthe Euro.  \nData for the Czech Koruna, Estonian Kroon, Hungarian Forint, Lithuanian \nLitas, Latvian Lats, Polish Zloty, Slovakian Koruna and Euro, all measured in US \n 10\nDollars, is taken from the Bank of England\u2019s statistics website for the period 15 7 05 \nto 28 10 08. This covers 835 daily FX rates, with the break occurring at 9 8 07. Plots \nof the logged series (unlabelled) are displayed in Figure 1. There may be a slow drift \ndownwards in the levels of the data but this may not be significant. In generally, the \nlower two (Czech Koruna and Estonian Kroon) appear almost flat, whilst the rest \nappear to drift very much in line. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n11\n\/0\n7\/\n20\n05\n11\n\/1\n0\/\n20\n05\n11\n\/0\n1\/\n20\n06\n11\n\/0\n4\/\n20\n06\n11\n\/0\n7\/\n20\n06\n11\n\/1\n0\/\n20\n06\n11\n\/0\n1\/\n20\n07\n11\n\/0\n4\/\n20\n07\n11\n\/0\n7\/\n20\n07\n11\n\/1\n0\/\n20\n07\n11\n\/0\n1\/\n20\n08\n11\n\/0\n4\/\n20\n08\n11\n\/0\n7\/\n20\n08\n11\n\/1\n0\/\n20\n08\n \nFigure 1 Exchange Rates vs US Dollar  \n \nThe autocorrelation functions (ACF) of the exchange rate data are considered.

Despite this, a Box-Ljung test (with 4 lags) \nindicates that the Latvian Lats and the Slovak Koruna follow random walks. \n \n 11\nTable 1 Autocorrelation Function Coefficients of the Data Differenced \nLag Czech Estonia Hungary Lithuania Latvia Poland Slovakia Euro \n1 .011 .009 .064 .009 .003 .093 .032 .008 \n2 .068 .058 -.007 .058 .055 .109 .039 .059 \n3 .023 .029 .067 .029 .035 .031 .012 .029 \n4 .118 .089 .159 .088 .076 .141 .079 .088 \n5 .012 -.009 .057 -.008 -.012 .025 -.014 -.009 \n6 -.003 -.006 -.076 -.006 -.010 -.051 -.023 -.006 \n7 .015 -.040 .065 -.040 -.033 -.001 -.005 -.040 \n8 .017 .005 .057 .004 .009 .065 .040 .004 \n9 -.038 -.043 -.023 -.043 -.043 -.024 -.015 -.042 \n10 -.036 -.028 -.007 -.028 -.017 .014 -.025 -.028 \n11 -.018 .016 .035 .016 .023 -.040 .006 .016 \n12 .089 .037 .092 .037 .046 .100 .055 .037 \n13 .035 .035 .043 .035 .045 .028 .071 .035 \n14 .025 .066 .031 .066 .065 .025 .035 .067 \n15 .070 .072 .061 .072 .065 .070 .017 .072 \n16 .005 -.025 -.036 -.026 -.020 .007 -.024 -.026 \nCritical Value 0.07 \n \nUsing the Akaike lag selection criterion, the data from the eight FX rate series will be \nconsidered for unit roots.

The results are for an \nADF with a linear trend (critical value \u20133.4175) and without a linear trend (critical \nvalue \u20132.8654). The unit root tests suggest that all the series are difference-stationary. \nGiven the discussion above the results entailing the intercept but no trend are more \nlikely to reflect the data generating mechanism. \n \n 12\nTable 2 Unit Root Test Results \n Before Aug 2007 After Aug 2007 \n a b a b \nCzech -1.1512 -2.9758 -1.4503 (4) 1.3986 \nEstonia -.72230 -3.0272 -.18490 (4) 1.6434 \nHungary -.69179 -1.9306 -.27336 (7) 1.7436 (7) \nLithuania -.72207 -3.0265 -.43831 (4) 1.6438 \nLatvia -.76062 -3.0103 -.15072 (4) 1.7467 \nPoland -1.1586 -3.3366 (1) -.68712 (4) 2.3436 (6) \nSlovakia -.11696 -2.5055 -1.2509 (4) 1.6214 \nEuro -.72156 -3.0275 -.43793 (4) 1.6450 \na intercept but not a trend  b an intercept and a linear trend  \nLag(0) unless indicated \n \nAnalytical Approach \nThe non-stationary data is tested for cointegration using the Johansen (1988) method. \nThe Johansen approach is based on full information maximum likelihood estimation \nand is primarily applied to I(1) data. Let xt be an n \u00d7 1 vector, with a pth order vector \nerror correction (VECM) format expressed as, \n\u0394xt =  \u03bc + \u0394x t\u2212j + \u03a0xt\u2212p +et ,  et ~ iid (0, \u03a9e), \u03a6 j\nj\np\n=1\n1\u2212\u2211\nwhere \u03bc is a vector of constants, xt vector of the n  FX rate variables, et is vector of \nresiduals and \u03a6 and \u03a0 are n \u00d7 n matrices of parameters. The long-term relationship \nparameter matrix, \u03a0 is assessed for its rank. If the rank of \u03a0 = r, where 0 < r < n, then \nsome or all the variables in xt are cointegrated with r cointegrating vectors. Defining \n\u03a0 = \u03b1\u03b2', where both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are n \u00d7 r matrices, the columns of \u03b2 form r distinct \ncointegrating vectors and \u03b1, the corresponding weights. The Johansen estimation \nprocedure offers two options for testing the number of cointegrating relations. The \none used here, known as the Trace test, entails the likelihood ratio  \n)\u02c61(\n1\n\u2211\n+=\n\u2212\u2212=\nn\nrj\njtrace lnT \u03bb\u03bb   (Johansen, 1995 p.93). \nThe Trace test is preferred to the alternative, the Maximal Eigenvalue, as it is more \nrobust to both residual skewness and kurtosis (Cheung and Lai, 1993). Silvapulle and \n 13\nPodivinsky (2000) report that, when using Johansen\u2019s technique, researchers should \nnot be overly concerned by small departures from normality, even in finite samples. \nThey examine the impact of skew and leptokurtic errors and find they represent a mild \nproblem. They also report that tests for restrictions on cointegrating vector values \nappear to be robust to both problem areas.  \n \nThe Number of Cointegrating Vectors \nThe Johansen MLE can produce as many as n \u2013 1 cointegrating vectors from n \nvariables. Dickey et al. (1991) suggest that each vector represents a constraint on a \nsystem of variables, restricting their deviations from the long-run relationship to be \nwithin certain boundaries. The greater the number of cointegrating relations, the more \nstable the model.  \nAs a cointegrating vector is a stationary linear combination of non-stationary \nvariables it is possible for a sub-set to be stationary. Davidson (2000) argues that a \ncointegrating relation with k (< n \u2212 1) variables may be reducible, implying a sub-set \nof k \u2212 j variables may be cointegrated. A cointegrating relation with k variables is \nonly irreducible if dropping any one of them leaves the set not cointegrated. Thus, \u201cit \nis legitimate to check for cointegrating relationships in sub-sets.\u201d (Dickey and \nRossana, 1994, p.342). This translates in to, with r cointegrating vectors among the n \nFX rates from Central Europe, the series are closely bonded with r = n \u2212 1 and \nweakly bonded if r = 1 and not bonded in the long run if r = 0. Jones and Leishman \n(2006) go one step further revealing a leading housing region by considering whether \nthe addition of that region to a group of others that are cointegrated results in an \nincrease in the number of cointegrating vectors. This translates in to, with r \ncointegrating vectors among the n FX rates from Central Europe, where n > r > 0, if it \n 14\nis a leading currency in the Jones and Leishman sense, the addition of the Euro to this \ngroup should be associated with r + 1 vectors from n + 1 currencies. \n \nGranger-causality \nIn an n-dimensional multivariate vector error correction model of lag order (p) \n(VECM(p)) for lnFX1, the logged foreign exchange rate for country 1, can be \nrepresented as \ntpjt\nr\nj\nj\np\nj\njntnjjt\np\nj\njjt\np\nj\njt ezFXFXFXFX 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1=\n21\n1\n1=\n111 ln..ln+ln=ln ++\u0394++\u0394\u0394+\u0394 \u2212\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2211\u2211\u2211\u2211 \u03b1\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u03bc\n \nwhere \nzjt = \u03bc1 + \u03b2j1 lnFX1t + \u03b2j2 lnFX2t + \u03b2j3 lnFX3t + \u2026 + \u03b2jn lnFXnt  \ne1t ~ iid (0, \u03c31e\u00b2), \n\u03bc1 is the intercept capturing rate of drift or is the mean of the levels of the \ndata. \n \nChanges in currency market 2 are said to Granger-causality changes in currency \nmarket 1 if \u03c62j \u2260 0 for all j, with the possibility of Granger-causality in both directions \n(feedback). Granger-causality and cointegration have been used to identify unified \nspatially-distinct markets and to delineate leading markets\/ spillover\/ contagion. \nFinding they are difference stationary suggests the FX rate series could be \ncointegrated. Using an Akaike lag selection criterion, a lag length of four for pre and \npost event structures is used. Two formats are considered for the VECM; the intercept \ncould be in the long run relations or in the short run expression. The results for the \nnumber of cointegrating vectors and Granger-causality were almost identical but the \n 15\nconstant in the short run relations was found to be zero in all cases, whereas the \nintercept in the long was found to be different from zero (see Table 4).  \n \nCointegration \nThe cointegration results for the pre and post August 2007 periods are reported in \nTable 3. In the period up to the crisis the group of seven currencies exhibit one \ncointegrating vector at the 5% level. Thus, there is a long run relation among the \ngroup. As the period considered does not involve a currency crisis, it will be assumed \nthat this reveals normal currency relations. There is only a weak link between them \nbut the follow common trends. In the period after August 2007, the period after the \nwestern banking crisis began to unfurl, the group of seven currencies exhibit two \ncointegrating vectors. Thus, in the crisis period, the bonds between the currencies \nappear to have increased. On this measure, there appears to be evidence of shift \ncontagion in the fifth definition sense of Pericoli and Sbracia (2003). \n \nTable 3 Cointegration Test Results  \nHypothesis Trace Statistic \n \nCritical \nValue  \nNull Alt.

The \nnull that the factor loading for currency j is zero is not rejected in the cases of Czech \n 16\nKoruna, Hungarian Forint, Latvian Lats, Polish Zloty and Slovakian Koruna in the pre \nAugust period. Indeed, the test results in Table 4 indicate two of the Baltic States \nappear cointegrated only. This suggests that these currencies are weakly bound at \nbest.  \n By contrast the post-August considerations paint a different picture. Only the \nSlovakian Koruna appears to have a zero weighting. Thus, there again appears to be a \nsignificant change in the level of interaction among the currencies of Central Europe. \nAgain, on this measure, there appears to be evidence of shift contagion. \n \nTable 4 Tests for Zero Loadings \n Before Aug \n2007 \nAfter Aug \n2007 \nCzech 1.2502[.264] 17.8387[.000]** \nEstonia 72.5458[.000]** 68.8259[.000]** \nHungary 1.2260[.268] 28.2844[.000]** \nLithuania 72.5415[.000]**  68.8029[.000]** \nLatvia .062087[.803] 7.9128[.019]* \nPoland .55444[.457]  23.2970[.000] ** \nSlovakia 2.9708[.085]  3.1801[.204] \nIntercept 72.5518[.000]**  68.8309[.000]**  \n \nGranger-causality \nThe short run links are revealed by Granger-causality tests based on the Vector Error \nCorrection Models. The models, in general, exhibit errors that are independent over \ntime. Where heteroscedasticity was evident, a Newey-West adjustment was made \nentailing 14 lags. As one might anticipate, this was needed more for the post than the \npre August 2007 period. The errors appear leptokurtic, which is common in financial \ndata and Silvapulle and Podivinsky (2000) view this as a minor problem.  \n The Wald tests, displayed in Table 5 for the period before the crisis, suggest \nthat there were no short run links among the Central European currencies. By \ncontrast, the Granger-causality test show, in Table 6, that Poland exhibits a leading \nrole in short run currency changes. The test results may also point to a secondary \n 17\neffect through Hungary. Moreover, Latvian Lats leads the Slovakian Koruna and \nfeeds-back with the Hungarian Forint. Overall, evidence suggests no currency is \nindependent of all others in the post August 2007 period. Yet again, on this measure, \nthere appears to be evidence of shift contagion in the fifth definition sense of Pericoli \nand Sbracia (2003). \n  \nTable 5 Granger-causality Test Results Before August 2007 \n Czech Estonia Hungary Lithuania Latvia Poland Slovakia \nCzech  1.8539 [.603] \n1.6908 \n[.639] \n1.8489 \n[.604] \n2.8452 \n[.416] \n2.9254 \n[.403] \n2.9527 \n[.399] \nEstonia 1.2044 [.752] \n 2.2688 \n[.519] \n1.0096 \n[.799] \n.94050 \n[.816] \n.49685 \n[.920] \n2.8030 \n[.423] \nHungary .78230 [.854] \n.88191 \n[.830] \n .88164 \n[.830] \n1.1665 \n[.761] \n1.4176 \n[.701] \n2.1412 \n[.544] \nLithuania 1.2248 [.747] \n1.0707 \n[.784] \n2.2530 \n[.522] \n .98893 \n[.804] \n.56249 \n[.905] \n2.9046 \n[.407] \nLatvia 1.3820 [.710] \n2.8198 \n[.420] \n1.0188 \n[.797] \n2.8340 \n[.418] \n 1.0966 \n[.778] \n4.8385 \n[.184] \nPoland 1.4911 [.684] \n3.2083 \n[.361] \n.52402 \n[.914] \n3.2005 \n[.362] \n3.7684 \n[.288] \n 4.4050 \n[.221] \nSlovakia .43537 [.933] \n.60089 \n[.896] \n.88433 \n[.829] \n.59335 \n[.898] \n.69252 \n[.875] \n.97703 \n[.807] \n \n \nTable 6 Granger-causality Test Results After August 2007 \n Czech Estonia Hungary Lithuania Latvia Poland Slovakia \nCzech  2.7313 [.435] \n4.0821 \n[.253] \n2.7753 \n[.428] \n2.8212 \n[.420] \n1.7559 \n[.625] \n.88978 \n[.828] \nEstonia 1.0834 [.781] \n 1.0094 \n[.799] \n1.5713 \n[.666] \n1.2790 \n[.734] \n2.2536 \n[.521] \n3.4446 \n[.328] \nHungary 15.8094 [.001]** \n7.9671 \n[.047]* \n 7.9879 \n[.046]* \n8.4145 \n[.038]* \n3.1606 \n[.368] \n8.5535 \n[.036]* \nLithuania 1.0378 [.792] \n1.5872 \n[.662] \n.94656 \n[.814] \n 1.3467 \n[.718] \n2.1941 \n[.533] \n3.4470 \n[.328] \nLatvia 2.2096 [.530] \n5.3731 \n[.146] \n9.0821 \n[.028]* \n5.3359 \n[.149] \n 7.8126 \n[.050] \n8.8606 \n[.031]* \nPoland 10.6085 [.014]* \n12.9904 \n[.005]** \n24.0237 \n[.000]** \n12.9300 \n[.005]** \n12.4727 \n[.006]** \n 9.3072 \n[.025]* \nSlovakia 1.0070 [.800] \n2.4606 \n[.482] \n1.9017 \n[.593] \n2.4342 \n[.487] \n2.5242 \n[.471] \n.26459 \n[.967] \n \n*sig. at the 5% level, **sig. at the 1% level \n \n                                                                               \nThe Leading Role of the Euro \nThe leading role of the Euro is considered in two ways: first, following Jones and \nLeishman (2006) the Euro should add an extra cointegrating vector if added to the \ngroup of seven currencies considered for cointegration; second, the Euro could \nGranger-cause change in other currencies.  \n 18\n Having found one cointegrating vector among the seven currencies before and \ntwo after August 2007, the null the addition of the Euro to the pre August 07 period \nproduces one or fewer vectors is rejected. A likelihood ratio statistic of 171, reported \nin Table 7 > critical value of 132 indicates there are two vectors (but not three, 72 < \n102). The inference is that the Euro leads the other seven currencies in the long run. \nThe same can be said of the post August period, where the null of two vectors is \nrejected in favour of three (105 > 102). Finding the Euro is a leading currency both \nbefore and after August 07 is consistent with Syriopoulos (2007) and suggests a stable \nrelation that may be one through which contagion could be transmitted. \n \nTable 7 Tests for Additional Cointegrating Vectors with the Euro \n 1 CV 2 CV 3CV\nTo Aug 07 320.3746   171.2067   72.4633   \nAfter Aug 07 284.0970   186.6748  105.8222   \nCritical Values 166.1200   132.4500   102.5600   \n    \n \nBy contrast with the long run, the short run reveals no leading role of the Euro. The \nWald tests, reported in Table 8 fail to reveal any Granger-causality from the Euro to a \nsingle currency.  \n \nTable 8 Granger-causality Test Results with the Euro \n Czech Estonia Hungary Lithuania Latvia Poland Slovakia\nTo Aug \n07 \n4.6533 \n[.199] \n3.2911 \n[.349] \n5.3368 \n[.149] \n3.2995 \n[.348] \n3.3799 \n[.337] \n4.3660 \n[.225] \n4.6148 \n[.202] \nAfter Aug \n07 \n3.3223 \n[.345] \n2.5787 \n[.461] \n1.4758 \n[.688] \n2.5923 \n[.459] \n3.1544 \n[.368] \n2.8674 \n[.413] \n3.1077 \n[.375] \n \n \nThe leading role of the Euro is confined to the long run. Unlike among the seven \nCentral European currencies, the Euro\u2019s influence on the region appears stable. These \nresults are out of line with Gilmore and McManus (2002) who find no cointegration. \n 19\nAlthough Syriopoulos (2007) finds one cointegrating vector this remains the case \nafter the schism. This does not demonstrate contagion. Serwa and Bohl (2005) do not \nfind contagion either across Eastern European markets. However, given the inclusion \nof two developed economy indices, Syriopoulos may have revealed a stable leading \nrole of the Dax and S&P500. His short run results does not indicate an increase in the \nlinks between markets, and so not evidence of shift contagion in the fifth definition \nsense of Pericoli and Sbracia (2003). \n \nConclusion \nThe findings suggests that despite not being of the region directly concerned, the EU-\n8 were subject to financial contagion, perhaps as a result of a banking sector that had \nstrong cross-border links and possibly based on lack of information about EU-8 \nmarkets. The assessment of shift contagion in the fifth definition sense of Pericoli and \nSbracia (2003) was revealed both in the long and short runs when comparing the pre \nand post August 2007 periods. Given the volatility among currencies of smaller \neconomies, the increased bonding, and targeting of the Euro, the scope for deflecting \nshocks through exchange rate adjustments was much reduced. The protected 2 year \nperiod of displaying financial rectitude via targeting the Euro before accession is \nconsidered may now appear a burden that the IMF is supporting indirectly. Perhaps, \nin the light of the regular crises that beset financial markets and how contagion \nappears to undermine the hope of self determination of a small economy, the EU \nshould reconsider the entry requirements for the EU-8 still not approved to join the \nEuro. \nAt the end of the study period the Slovakian Koruna was revalued and then \ngranted permission to join the Euro in 2009 whilst the Forint was facing sustained \n 20\nspeculative pressure. Following offering an emergency package to Hungary of $25bn, \nthe IMF set up a $100bn fund to support emerging economies weather the global \ncredit crunch. If the EU continues to require convergence of economy with emerging \nmarkets to the standards expected of developed economies before currency accession \nto monetary union, research is needed explore how a record of financial rectitude can \nbe demonstrated whilst recognising that contagion is more likely to affect those \nemerging markets with information deficiencies.   \n \n \nReferences \nAuYong, H., Gan, C. & Treepongkaruna, S.
