Evidence from macropalaeontology, calcareous, phosphatic 18 \nand silicious micropalaeontology, cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cysts, miospores and 19 \nstrontium isotopes made available after the establishment of these zones in the 1980s 20 \nhas been used to reinterpret this important zonal scheme. The Shublikodinium 21 \nSuperzone is renamed herein as the Rhaetogonyaulax Superzone. The 22 \nRhaetogonyaulax Superzone is reinterpreted as being Ladinian to Early Sinemurian, 23 \n 2 \nmainly using conodont data. It is thus significantly shorter in duration than was 24 \noriginally envisaged (Late Anisian to Late Pliensbachian). The Luehndea Assemblage 25 \nis a low diversity dinoflagellate cyst association which marks a eustatic rise; it is 26 \nsubdivided into two subzones. It is of latest Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian age, 27 \nbased largely on palynological evidence. The Bajocian to earliest Oxfordian 28 \nPareodinia ceratophora Superzone represents the inception of the continuous 29 \nMesozoic-Cenozoic dinoflagellate cyst record in Australia. It comprises seven zones, 30 \nwhich appear to be slightly older than originally interpreted based on evidence from 31 \nammonites, calcareous nannofossils, strontium isotope stratigraphy and dinoflagellate 32 \ncysts. The overlying Pyxidiella Superzone is characterised by diverse dinoflagellate 33 \ncyst associations. It is Early Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian in age, and comprises three 34 \nzones. The bases of the Wanaea spectabilis and Wanaea clathrata zones are 35 \nreinterpreted as being slightly older than originally envisaged. The superjacent 36 \nFromea cylindrica Superzone is Tithonian to earliest Valanginian and modified ages 37 \nare indicated for four of the nine zones. This unit is dominated by endemic 38 \ndinoflagellate cysts, reflecting a global trend towards provincialism at this time due to 39 \na regressive eustatic regime. 40 \n 41 \nKeywords: biostratigraphy; dinoflagellate cysts; Mesozoic; Australia 42 \n 43 \n1. Introduction 44 \nAn integrated dinoflagellate cyst and spore-pollen biozonation for the Late 45 \nPermian (Gzhelian) to Palaeocene (Danian) was published by Helby et al. (1987a). 46 \nThis landmark study was begun in the 1970s; it was presented at symposia and 47 \n 3 \ncirculated informally prior to publication in 1987. The necessary extensive taxonomic 48 \ndocumentation was published in 13 papers within the same volume (Jell, 1987). This 49 \nimportant biostratigraphical scheme rapidly became the standard Mesozoic 50 \npalynozonation used in exploration geology on the North West Shelf of Australia 51 \n(Fig. 1). Helby et al. (1987a) includes a Middle Triassic (Anisian) to Palaeocene 52 \n(Danian) dinoflagellate cyst zonal scheme comprising 45 zones, 44 of which are 53 \nsubdivided into seven superzones. The resolution of this zonal scheme is somewhat 54 \nvariable, but generally it provides substage level subdivision. It is clear that a 55 \nsignificantly greater level of precision is possible because a series of alphanumeric 56 \nsubzones were illustrated, but not defined (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 47). 57 \nRecently the biozonation of Helby et al. (1987a) has been significantly refined 58 \nin terms of its resolution. In a series of taxonomic papers largely on the Jurassic, 59 \nHelby and Partridge (2001) and Riding and Helby (2001a-h) described 55 new 60 \ndinoflagellate cyst and acritarch species. Many of these taxa allow the definition of 61 \nsubzones within the biozonation of Helby et al. (1987a). These intervals, numbered 62 \nwith alphanumeric codes, were illustrated by Foster (2001, fig. 2). The subzones 63 \nremain informal, however the datums which allow this relatively refined biozonation 64 \nto be recognised have been illustrated by Helby et al. (2004) and Partridge (2006). 65 \nCompared with similar biozonations, this zonal scheme has relatively few ties 66 \nto the Mesozoic Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points (GSSPs) (Helby et al, 67 \n1987a, figs. 4, 12, 19, 32). By contrast, the European Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst 68 \nbiozonations of Woollam and Riding (1983), Riding and Thomas (1992) and Poulsen 69 \nand Riding (2003) are closely calibrated throughout to the Sub-Boreal ammonite 70 \nzonation. Furthermore, there are many more published data on Jurassic dinoflagellate 71 \ncysts from Europe in comparison to Australia. 72 \n 4 \nBased on the ranges of certain key taxa in Helby et al. (1987a), there are 73 \napparently some incoherencies in the stratigraphical ranges of important cosmopolitan 74 \ntaxa between Australasia and Europe. For example, Davey (1988), Riding and 75 \nFensome (2002) and Riding (2003; 2005a) commented that the range tops of species 76 \nsuch as Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Rigaudella aemula and Scriniodinium 77 \ncrystallinum are significantly younger in Australasia than in Europe. Reworking 78 \nand\/or palaeogeographical and\/or palaeolatitudinal factors may explain this apparent 79 \nheterochroneity. Furthermore, Riding and Helby (2001b) and Riding and Fensome 80 \n(2002) illustrated and commented on disparities in the ranges of species of Wanaea 81 \nand Endoscrinium\/Scriniodinium respectively between the Northern and Southern 82 \nhemispheres. For example, Riding and Helby (2001b, fig. 12) commented that, 83 \ngenerally, Australian species of Wanaea are somewhat younger than their European 84 \ncounterparts. Subsequently, Riding (2003) suggested that the ages of most of the early 85 \nBajocian to early Berriasian Australasian dinoflagellate cyst zones of Helby et al. 86 \n(1987a) appear to be anomalously young when compared with European ranges of 87 \ncosmopolitan taxa. 88 \nIn this paper, we attempt to comprehensively and objectively review the ages 89 \nof the Australasian dinoflagellate cyst zones of Helby et al. (1987; 2004) and 90 \nPartridge (2006) from the Middle Triassic (Ladinian) to the Late Jurassic (Tithonian). 91 \nThis study is based on biostratigraphical evidence developed since the publication of 92 \nHelby et al. (1987a), and new Australian Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst and other 93 \npalaeontological data. 94 \n 95 \n2. The Late Triassic and Jurassic geology of the North West Shelf of Australia 96 \n 5 \nThe North West Shelf represents the passive continental margin of northwestern 97 \nAustralia and comprises the Northern Carnarvon, Roebuck, Offshore Canning, 98 \nBrowse and Bonaparte basins (Fig. 1). This large area, also known as the Westralian 99 \nSuperbasin, is an extensive depocentre approximately 2400 km long and 400 km 100 \nwide. The region represents the premier hydrocarbon province in Australia as 101 \nsummarised in Longley et al. (2002). Late Triassic and Jurassic strata occur across 102 \nAustralia with predominantly non-marine deposits in the onshore eastern basins, and 103 \nmixed terrestrial-marine sediments in the major northwestern and western basins. 104 \nMost onshore Triassic-Jurassic strata are non-marine, largely fluvial-dominated 105 \nsuccessions that are devoid of dinoflagellate cysts; they will not be discussed further. 106 \nThick Jurassic marine successions are largely confined to the North West Shelf, with 107 \na thin transgressive package in the Perth Basin. 108 \nThe North West Shelf formed as an intracratonic rift with the earliest known 109 \ntectonic activity occurring in the Cambrian, and the first continental slivers rifted off 110 \nduring Devonian to Permian fragmentation (Metcalfe, 1990). The final significant 111 \nperiod of terrane dispersal, which led to the break-up of Gondwana, occurred in the 112 \nLate Triassic to Late Jurassic. Rifting commenced in the Carnian and Norian and a 113 \nconcurrent uplift and erosion event, the 'Fitzroy Movement' (Forman and Wales, 114 \n1981), along the northwest margin of Australia provided large volumes of sediment to 115 \nthe newly formed depocentres. Thick Carnian-Norian fluvio-deltaic successions were 116 \ndeposited as the Mungaroo Formation in the Northern Carnarvon Basin and the upper 117 \nKeraudren Formation in the Offshore Canning Basin. These were subsequently 118 \noverlain by the transgressive, paralic to shallow-marine successions of the Brigadier 119 \nand Bedout formations, respectively. Marine sediments in the Bonaparte and Browse 120 \nbasins are represented by the paralic to shallow marine Pollard, Challis and Nome 121 \n 6 \nformations (Fig. 2). The oldest consistently recorded dinoflagellate cyst assemblages 122 \nin Australia, the Rhaetogonyaulax Superzone, are known from the Upper Carnian to 123 \nRhaetian marine beds of the North West Shelf. 124 \nThe Lower Jurassic succession of the North West Shelf comprises much marginal 125 \nmarine and some non-marine sedimentation. Marine environments persisted in the 126 \nNorthern Carnarvon Basin, where shallow marine to paralic conditions are 127 \nrepresented by the North Rankin Formation and the Murat Siltstone. The sometimes 128 \nsparse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of the Dapcodinium priscus Zone are recorded 129 \nfrom the North Rankin Formation and the underlying Brigadier Formation in the 130 \nNorthern Carnarvon Basin, and the lower Plover Formation in the Bonaparte Basin 131 \n(Fig. 2). The thick Early Jurassic lower Plover Formation successions in the 132 \nBonaparte and Browse basins contain marine, paralic and fluvial sediments. 133 \nStratigraphically important but sparse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of the 134 \nLuehndea Assemblage have been recovered from the lower Plover Formation of the 135 \nJabiru and Skua oilfields (Riding and Helby, 2001a; Fig. 2). Dinoflagellate cyst 136 \nabundance and diversity are extremely low in the Early Jurassic to early Middle 137 \nJurassic of Australia. Dinoflagellate cysts are absent or rare in the Late Sinemurian to 138 \nEarly Bajocian; this is similar to the coeval record in the Northern Hemisphere 139 \n(Riding and Thomas, 1992). 140 \nProgressive deepening throughout the Middle Jurassic is evident from the 141 \nincreased coastal plain and tidal channel deposits within the upper Plover Formation 142 \nof the Bonaparte and Browse basins, occasional marine influence in the fluvio-deltaic 143 \nDepuch Formation of the Offshore Canning Basin, the marine Cadda Formation in the 144 \nNorth Perth Basin and the persistent marine environments in the Northern Carnarvon 145 \nBasin (Fig. 2). In the latter basin, the restricted marine Athol Formation and overlying 146 \n 7 \ndeltaic Legendre Formation contain moderately abundant dinoflagellate cyst 147 \nassemblages. These associations represent the major radiation of gonyaulacacean 148 \ndinoflagellate cysts in Australia. In the Bonaparte and Browse basins, the major 149 \nincrease in dinoflagellate cyst diversity occurs in the Callovian deltaic to nearshore 150 \ndeposits of the Elang, Laminaria and Montara formations (Fig. 2). 151 \nThick successions of marine claystones, siltstones and fine sandstones represent 152 \nthe major fill of the Late Jurassic depocentres of the North West Shelf. The Dingo 153 \nClaystone is particularly thick (~3500 m), and is one of the key source rocks in the 154 \nNorthern Carnarvon Basin. It is overlain by the shallow to deep marine Angel 155 \nFormation and the submarine fan sands of the Dupuy Formation (Fig. 2). In the 156 \nBrowse and Bonaparte basins, a similarly rapid transgressive phase occurred across 157 \nunderlying shallow marine and deltaic successions. This is represented by the Vulcan 158 \nFormation and the Frigate Shale; these Late Jurassic marine deposits contain 159 \nextremely abundant and diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. 160 \n 161 \n3. Overview of Triassic and Jurassic marine palynology 162 \nTriassic and Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts have been intensively studied since 163 \nthe 1960s, and Riding and Sarjeant (1985), Riding and Thomas, (1992) and Riding 164 \nand Ioannides (1996) outlined their history of study. For the Northern Hemisphere, 165 \nthe majority of publications on this topic are from northwest Europe, where the 166 \nstandard Triassic and Jurassic stage stratotypes and GSSPs are located, and many of 167 \nthese data are correlated with the standard ammonite zonation. Some of the major 168 \npapers on this topic are Wiggins (1973), Bujak and Fisher (1976), Raynaud (1978), 169 \nWoollam and Riding (1983), Riding and Sarjeant (1985), Riding and Thomas (1988; 170 \n 8 \n1992; 1997), Feist-Burkhardt and Wille (1992), Poulsen (1996), Feist-Burkhardt and 171 \nMonteil (1997), Riding et al. (1999), Riding (2005b) and Bucefalo Palliana and Burati 172 \n(2006). Riding and Ioannides (1996) gave a review of Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts 173 \nwith a comprehensive bibliography. These authors also described major trends in the 174 \nglobal provincialism of these marine palynomorphs. 175 \nBackhouse (1988), Riding and Ioannides (1996) and Mantle (2009a) assessed 176 \nthe literature on Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts from Australasia. The earliest 177 \npublications on Austral Mesozoic dinoflagellate cysts were the results of the extensive 178 \ncollaborative work between Isabel C. Cookson of Melbourne and prominent European 179 \npalynologists, firstly Georges Deflandre and subsequently, Alfred Eisenack (e.g. 180 \nDeflandre and Cookson 1955; Cookson and Eisenack, 1958; 1960). This early 181 \nresearch was principally taxonomic, and the first comprehensive dinoflagellate cyst 182 \nbiozonation covering the Jurassic was Helby et al. (1987a). This scheme was the 183 \nresult of much work done on behalf of the petroleum exploration industry in offshore 184 \nAustralia by the authors and workers such as Ott (1970). Davey (1988) produced a 185 \nMiddle Jurassic (Bathonian) to Early Cretaceous (Aptian) palynozonation for Papua 186 \nNew Guinea. The correlation of this zonal scheme with that of Helby et al. (1987a) 187 \nwas discussed by Francis and Westermann (1993) and Davey (1999). Other papers on 188 \nAustralasian and Antarctic marine Jurassic palynology include Filatoff (1975), 189 \nWiseman (1980), Wilson (1984), Wilson and Helby (1986; 1987), Stover and Helby 190 \n(1987a,b), Backhouse (1988), Helby and Wilson (1988), Helby et al. (1988), Welsh 191 \n(1990), Riding et al. (1992), Sarjeant et al. (1992), Snape (1992), Bint and Marshall 192 \n(1994), Burger (1994; 1996), Nicoll and Foster (1994); Parker (1986), Riding and 193 \nHelby (2001a-g), Backhouse et al. (2002), Riding and Fensome (2002), Mantle (2005; 194 \n2009a,b), Riding (2005a) and Riding et al. (2010). 195 \n 9 \nTying Australian Jurassic palynozonation schemes to the geological timescale 196 \nor making valid correlations to the more tightly constrained European dinoflagellate 197 \ncyst zonations has always been problematic. There are very few Jurassic ammonite 198 \nlocalities in Australia and those that are documented or specimens fortuitously 199 \nrecovered from boreholes are often highly endemic. However, there are fossiliferous 200 \nJurassic sections with well-preserved ammonite-belemnite-bivalve faunas in India 201 \n(Krishna et al. 1982, Garg et al. 2003), Indonesia (Sato et al., 1978; Challinor and 202 \nSkwarko, 1982; Westermann and Callomon, 1988; Challinor, 1991), New Zealand 203 \n(Stevens, 1965, 1997; Challinor, 1999, 2001, 2003), and Papua New Guinea (Norvick, 204 \n1973; Challinor, 1990; Sukamto and Westermann, 1992). The key papers detailing 205 \ndinoflagellate cyst assemblages associated with these molluscan faunas are Helby et 206 \nal. (1987a), Helby and Hasibuan (1988), Helby et al. (1988), Francis and Westermann 207 \n(1993) and Garg et al. (2003). These papers document the few macrofaunal ties to the 208 \ngeological timescale for Australasian Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts. However, the 209 \nendemic nature of many of these faunas means that correlation to the standard 210 \nEuropean ammonite zonation is a convoluted process that for some assemblages 211 \ninvolves multiple steps using macrofaunal tie points across several continents. 212 \nCalcareous nannofossils may also have great potential as a correlative 213 \nmicrofossil group on the North West Shelf. The most widely utilised Jurassic 214 \nnannofossil zonation (NJ zonation scheme of Bown and Cooper, 1998) resulted from 215 \nmany studies of European successions and is directly correlated with the standard 216 \nEuropean ammonite successions. Howe (2000) stated that the NJ nannofossil zones 217 \nappear to be readily applicable to Australian successions and he detailed calcareous 218 \nnannofossil assemblages from 17 petroleum exploration wells in the Northern 219 \nCarnarvon Basin and Timor Sea. The spore-pollen and dinoflagellate cyst zones for 220 \n 10 \nthese samples were also listed, thus providing an important set of independent Jurassic 221 \nmicrofossil ties to the geological timescale. However, this study remains a pilot 222 \nproject and until more Australian successions (particularly continuous sections) are 223 \nstudied there will remain some uncertainties. There must be a distinct possibility that 224 \nsome similar or even identical calcareous nannofossils have different ranges in 225 \nAustralasia compared to the Northern Hemisphere as is widely observed amongst the 226 \ndinoflagellate cyst faunas. 227 \nConodont elements are another critical but much under-studied correlative tool 228 \nfor marine successions of the Australian Triassic. Important papers on successions in 229 \nthe North West Shelf (Nicoll & Foster, 1994, 1998; Nicoll, 2002) provide valuable 230 \nconodont ties points for the more widely available palynological assemblages. As for 231 \nthe calcareous nannofossils, the conodont zonations developed in the Northern 232 \nHemisphere appear to be consistently applicable across the North West Shelf. 233 \nHowever, whilst some moderately abundant and diverse conodont faunas have been 234 \nrecovered, there are also some tie points that are based on very few or fragmented 235 \nspecimens. Another major consideration is that facies changes can have a major 236 \ninfluence on conodont distribution and there are currently too few suitable lithologies 237 \nto fully model these changes in Australian successions. 238 \n 239 \n4. Stratigraphical palynology 240 \nIn this section the 20 Middle Triassic (Anisian-Ladinian) to earliest 241 \nCretaceous (earliest Berriasian) dinoflagellate cyst zones of Helby et al (1987a; 2004) 242 \nand Partridge (2006), and the one dinoflagellate cyst assemblage of Riding and Helby 243 \n(2001a) are reviewed with emphasis on their respective ages. The 20 dinoflagellate 244 \n 11 \ncyst zones are within four of the seven Mesozoic dinoflagellate cyst superzones of 245 \nHelby et al (1987a). The original tie points, subsequent relevant stratigraphical 246 \ninformation and the ages of the relevant cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst taxa are 247 \ndiscussed as appropriate. 248 \n A schematic comparison of the zonations of Helby et al (1987a), Helby et al. 249 \n(2004)\/Partridge (2006) and the present interpretation is given as Figs. 3, 4. The 250 \nvarious supporting stratigraphical data used herein for the age assessments of the 251 \nMiddle Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous dinoflagellate cyst zones are summarised in 252 \nFig. 5. Comparative range charts for selected Middle Triassic (Anisian) to earliest 253 \nCretaceous (earliest Berriasian) dinoflagellate cysts from Alaska, Australia, the 254 \nArctic, Europe, New Zealand and Russia as appropriate are presented as Figs. 6-10. 255 \nThese diagrams are designed to enable the comparison of the ranges of key marker 256 \ndinoflagellate cysts from appropriate regions. The majority of the data were taken 257 \nfrom the literature and unpublished public domain literature such as released well 258 \ncompletion reports. Fig. 11 is a compilation of the most important Middle Jurassic 259 \n(Bajocian) to earliest Cretaceous (earliest Berriasian) dinoflagellate cyst marker 260 \nspecies of the North West Shelf of Australia. 261 \nFull author citations and the related bibliography for all the dinoflagellate cyst 262 \ntaxa quoted may be found in Fensome and Williams (2004). 263 \n 264 \n4.1 The Rhaetogonyaulax Superzone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised herein 265 \nHelby et al. (1987a) established the Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic 266 \nShublikodinium Superzone. The name is changed herein to the Rhaetogonyaulax 267 \nSuperzone because Shublikodinium is a junior synonym of Rhaetogonyaulax 268 \n 12 \naccording to Stover and Evitt (1978) and Lentin and Williams (1989). The 269 \nRhaetogonyaulax Superzone was defined on a composite succession from the 270 \nBonaparte Basin, and was interpreted as being Middle Triassic (Late Anisian) to Early 271 \nJurassic (Late Pliensbachian) by Helby et al. (1987a, fig. 46). It is based on the 272 \npresence of the Rhaetogonyaulax (Shublikodinium) Flora, a low-diversity suite of 273 \nmainly rhaetogonyaulacoid and suessioid dinoflagellate cysts. This assemblage is 274 \nconfined to marginal basins in Western Australia and Indonesia. Helby et al. (1987a) 275 \nestablished six zones within the Rhaetogonyaulax Superzone. The ages of the 276 \nyoungest four Triassic subdivisions were revised by Nicoll and Foster (1994) as a 277 \nresult of conodont biostratigraphy \u2013 conodonts provide the best independent age 278 \ncontrol for the Middle to Late Triassic palynozones of the North West Shelf. 279 \nHelby et al. (1987a, fig. 8) illustrated 12 dinoflagellate cysts from the 280 \nRhaetogonyaulax Superzone. Susadinium sp. A is now Susadinium? australis and is 281 \ninterpreted as Early Toarcian (Riding and Helby, 2001a). Of the remaining 11 taxa, 282 \nsix are known from Europe; these are Beaumontella langii, Dapcodinium priscus, 283 \nHeibergella? kendelbachia, Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, Suessia swabiana and 284 \nSverdrupiella spp. The remaining five (Sahulidinium ottii, Hebecysta balmei, 285 \nRhaetogonyaulax wigginsii, Suessia sp. A and Wanneria listeri) are so far known only 286 \nfrom Australia. The ranges of the principal Ladinian to Sinemurian cosmopolitan 287 \ndinoflagellate cysts are illustrated in Fig. 6. Australasian-European provincialism is 288 \nmore marked than it appears because the latest Carnian-Sinemurian part of the 289 \nRhaetogonyaulax Superzone also contains low diversity suites of undescribed 290 \ndinoflagellate cysts (Helby et al., 1987a). Wilson and Helby (1986) was the first 291 \npublished report of Triassic dinoflagellate cysts from Australasia. Subsequent 292 \ncontributions include Helby et al. (1987a,b), Stover and Helby (1987a), Helby and 293 \n 13 \nWilson (1988), Brenner (1992), Burger (1994; 1996), Nicoll and Foster 294 \n(1994),Backhouse and Balme (2002), and Backhouse et al. (2002). 295 \nDespite similarities at the generic level (Fig. 6), Middle Triassic to earliest 296 \nJurassic dinoflagellate cysts exhibit marked provincialism. The most diverse Mid-Late 297 \nTriassic associations are from the Carnian and Norian of arctic Canada, where 298 \ndiversity may reach 19 species (Bujak and Fisher, 1976), and Alaska where Wiggins 299 \n(1976) listed 42 species on his summary range chart. These Arctic palynofloras are 300 \ndominated by Sverdrupiella and its close relatives Hebecysta, Heibergella and 301 \nNoricysta. The Sverdrupiella suite had a circum-Pacific distribution during the Norian 302 \n(Helby et al, 1987b). Species of this plexus in arctic Canada and Australasia are 303 \ndifferent, and diversity is much reduced in the Southern Hemisphere (Helby and 304 \nWilson, 1988). Moreover, representatives of the Sverdrupiella suite are extremely rare 305 \nin the Rhaetian of Europe (Morbey and Dunay, 1978; Riding and Thomas, 1992). The 306 \ndinoflagellate cyst record in Europe is confined to the latest Triassic (Rhaetian), 307 \nwhere eight species are known (Riding and Thomas, 1992, fig. 2.8). This flora is 308 \ndominated by the cosmopolitan species Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica (see Orbell, 1973; 309 \nFig. 6). 310 \nDespite some provincial differences, the Rhaetian to Hettangian dinoflagellate 311 \ncyst records of Europe and Australia also exhibit significant similarities. For example 312 \nthe oldest occurrences of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the earliest Rhaetian, and the 313 \npresence of Dapcodinium priscus in the absence of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the 314 \nHettangian-Early Sinemurian appear to have widespread correlative significance (Fig. 315 \n6). It is also clear that facies control strongly influenced the stratigraphical distribution 316 \nof marine palynomorphs during the Triassic and Early Jurassic. Major eustatic shifts 317 \nand marine transgressions appeared to have controlled certain bioevents. For example, 318 \n 14 \nthe influx of dinoflagellate cysts including Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica during the Early 319 \nRhaetian of Europe was probably related to the transgressive surface close to the base 320 \nof the UAB-1 2nd-Order Supercycle of Haq et al. (1987). 321 \n 322 \n4.1.1 The Sahulidinium ottii Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 323 \nThis stratigraphically isolated, monospecific association represents the oldest 324 \nrecord of unequivocal dinoflagellate cysts in the world. It is known only from samples 325 \ncontaining a Staurosaccites quadrifidus Spore-pollen Zone assemblage. The age 326 \ncontrol for the Sahulidinium ottii and Staurosaccites quadrifidus zones was based on 327 \nthe occurrences of Early-Middle Anisian ammonoids and bivalves in older strata and 328 \nCarnian dinoflagellate cysts in younger strata (Wiggins, 1973; Skwarko and Kummel, 329 \n1974; Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 4). Based on this indirect evidence, Helby et al. (1987a, 330 \nfig. 8) assigned their Sahulidinium ottii Zone to the Late Anisian-Early Ladinian. 331 \nHowever, the range of this species is herein considered to lie within the Ladinian to 332 \nearliest Carnian based on equivocal conodont data (fragments of Paragondolella spp.) 333 \nfrom the Cape Londonderry Formation in the Kelp Deep-1 well (unpublished data). 334 \nThis conodont data suggests the Staurosaccites quadrifidus Spore-pollen Zone may 335 \nrange up to the earliest Carnian. Furthermore, the Sahulidinium ottii Zone reference 336 \nsection consists of a thin (~3m) interval in the Sahul Shoals-1 well and is suggestive 337 \nof a relatively short zonal duration; there is currently no definite evidence for an 338 \nAnisian age (Fig. 6). 339 \n 340 \n4.1.2 The Rhaetogonyaulax wigginsii Zone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised by Nicoll 341 \nand Foster (1994) 342 \n 15 \nThe Rhaetogonyaulax wigginsii Zone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised by 343 \nNicoll and Foster (1994) was defined by the range bases of Rhaetogonyaulax 344 \nwigginsii and Wanneria listeri (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 8). The original name was the 345 \nShublikodinium wigginsii Zone of Helby et al. (1987a). The inception of 346 \nRhaetogonyaulax wigginsii in the latest Carnian represents the base of the continuous 347 \nLate Triassic-earliest Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst record in Australia. Only 348 \nRhaetogonyaulax wigginsii and Suessia swabiana occur in this zone (Helby et al., 349 \n1987a, fig. 8). The dating of this zone as latest Carnian to mid Norian is based on 350 \ncorrelation with the Samaropollenites speciosus Spore-pollen Zone of Helby (1987a), 351 \nand the Epigondolella triangularis, Metapolygnathus primitius, and Metapolygnathus 352 \ncommunisti conodont zones from the reference section, the Sahul Shoals-1 well from 353 \nthe North West Shelf of Australia (Nicoll and Foster, 1994). This is broadly consistent 354 \nwith the oldest occurrence of Rhaetogonyaulax spp. in the latest and Late Carnian of 355 \nAlaska and arctic Canada, respectively (Wiggins, 1973; Bujak and Fisher, 1976; 356 \nHelby et al., 1987a, fig. 4; Fig. 6). 357 \n 358 \n4.1.3 The Wanneria listeri Zone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised by Nicoll and Foster 359 \n(1994) and Backhouse et al. (2002) 360 \nThe original Suessia listeri Zone (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 8) was defined by 361 \nthe range bases of the index species and Hebecysta balmei. Nicoll and Foster (1994) 362 \nand Backhouse et al. (2002) renamed this unit the Wanneria listeri Zone. 363 \nRhaetogonyaulax wigginsii, Suessia swabiana, Wanneria listeri and various 364 \nundescribed taxa are present in this interval (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 8). 365 \n 16 \nNicoll and Foster (1994, p.105) reported a single conodont tie point 366 \n(Epigondolella bidentata) from the uppermost part of the zone in the reference 367 \nsection, the Ashmore Reef-1 well. Helby et al. (1987a, fig.4) used the range bases of 368 \nHeibergella and Sverdrupiella in the overlying Hebecysta balmei Zone to assign a 369 \nNorian or older age to the Wanneria listeri Zone. However, Bujak and Fisher (1976, 370 \ntable 1) indicated that the inceptions of Heibergella and Sverdrupiella in the Sverdrup 371 \nBasin of arctic Canada are of Carnian age (Fig. 6). The boundary between the 372 \nWanneria listeri and Hebecysta balmei zones appears to be somewhat facies-373 \ncontrolled, and conodont evidence indicates considerable overlap in the zonal ranges 374 \n(Nicoll and Foster, 1994, figs. 2, 4). The range base of inconsistent 375 \nClassopollis\/Corollina spp. at the base of the Wanneria listeri Zone in Australia 376 \ncoincides with the increase in abundance of this pollen in Europe (Morbey, 1978; 377 \nVisscher et al., 1980; Fig. 6).  378 \nLargely based on the supporting conodont evidence, the Wanneria listeri Zone 379 \nis considered herein to be of Middle-Late Norian age. 380 \n 381 \n4.1.4 The Hebecysta balmei Zone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised by Nicoll and 382 \nFoster (1994) and Backhouse et al. (2002) 383 \nThe Hebecysta balmei Zone is defined as the interval between the inceptions 384 \nof Hebecysta balmei and Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 8). 385 \nHebecysta balmei and Sverdrupiella spp. are both confined to this biozone, although 386 \nSverdrupiella spp. are more typical towards the middle of the zone (R. Helby personal 387 \ncommunication) rather than at the base of the zone as depicted by Helby et al. 388 \n(1987a). Wanneria listeri is the main accessory dinoflagellate cyst with rare Noricysta 389 \n 17 \nsp., Dapcodinium sp., Rhaetogonyaulax wigginsii and Suessia swabiana found in only 390 \na few wells. 391 \nThe age of this zone was assigned to the Middle-Late Norian by Helby et al. 392 \n(1987a) based on the inceptions of Heibergella and Sverdrupiella in the Canadian 393 \narctic. Similar range bases for these genera were also recorded by Wiggins (1976) for 394 \nAlaska and for Sverdrupiella in New Zealand (Helby and Wilson, 1988). These 395 \ndatums, however, may occur in the Carnian of northern Canada (Bujak and Fisher, 396 \n1976; Fig. 6). The Middle-Late Norian age was revised to Late Norian to earliest 397 \nRhaetian by Nicoll and Foster (1994; 1998) and Backhouse et al. (2002). This was 398 \nbased on conodont and pollen data from the reference sections, the Mt. Ashmore-1B 399 \nand Ashmore Reef-1 wells, respectively. The Hebecysta balmei Interval Zone is 400 \nassociated with the Epigondolella postera, and Epigondolella bidentata conodont 401 \nzones (Nicoll and Foster, 1994; 1998), and the Minutosaccus crenulatus Spore-pollen 402 \nZone of Helby et al. (1987a). Nicoll and Foster (1994) also recorded the co-403 \noccurrence of conodonts of the Misikella hernsteini Conodont Zone within the 404 \nHebecysta balmei and Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica zones thus indicating that the zonal 405 \nboundaries are either diachronous or overlap within the range of the Misikella 406 \nhernsteini Conodont Zone (as depicted by Nicoll and Foster, 1994, p. 103). The 407 \nHebecysta balmei Zone is attributed herein to the Middle - Late Norian or possibly to 408 \nearliest Rhaetian (Fig. 6). 409 \n 410 \n4.1.5 The Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) revised by Nicoll 411 \nand Foster (1994), Backhouse and Balme (2002) and Backhouse et al. (2002) 412 \n 18 \nThis zone is defined by the range of prominent Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, 413 \nalthough this is probably somewhat facies controlled with Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica 414 \nprominent in open marine settings and scarce in some shallower marine environments 415 \nwhere Wanneria listeri is typically the most abundant dinoflagellate cyst. The 416 \ninception of Dapcodinium priscus also marks the base of this unit, and the top is 417 \nfurther delineated by an increase in abundance of Dapcodinium priscus and the range 418 \nbases of Beaumontella langii, Heibergella kendelbachia and Suessia sp. A (Helby et 419 \nal., 1987a, fig. 8). Accessory forms comprise Rhaetogonyaulax wigginsii, Suessia 420 \nswabiana, Noricysta sp. and a low-diversity suite of undescribed forms. 421 \nThe Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone was interpreted as being of Early-Middle 422 \nRhaetian age based on the inception and decline of the index species (Helby et al., 423 \n1987a, fig. 4). This age was revised to Early to Late Rhaetian by Nicoll and Foster 424 \n(1994; 1998) on conodont evidence. Bralower et al. (1992) and Brenner et al. (1992) 425 \nreported Rhaetian calcareous nannofossils and ostracods from the lower and upper 426 \nparts of the Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone from the Wombat Plateau, offshore 427 \nWestern Australia. The Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone and the Ashmoripollis 428 \nreducta Spore-pollen Zone were both correlated with the Misikella hernsteini and 429 \nMisikella posthernsteini conodont zones, based on data from the Ashmore Reef-1 well 430 \n(Nicoll and Foster, 1994; 1998). This age is consistent with the presence of 431 \nRhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the Rhaetian of Europe (e.g. Morbey, 1975; 1978; 432 \nMorbey and Dunay, 1978; Powell, 1992; Fig. 6). In the U.K. Rhaetogonyaulax 433 \nrhaetica is common to abundant at the Westbury Formation-Lilstock Formation 434 \ntransition, and is frequently prominent in the unequivocal Late Rhaetian Cotham 435 \nMember (e.g. Morbey, 1978; Warrington et al., 1980; Warrington and Whittaker, 436 \n1984; Lott and Warrington, 1988). The entire range of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica 437 \n 19 \nhence confirms the conodont dating of the Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone in 438 \nAustralia as early to late Rhaetian (Fig. 6). The major reappearance of dinoflagellate 439 \ncysts at the base of the Rhaetian Stage in the Northern Carnarvon Basin also closely 440 \nmirrors the progression from non-marine to marine conditions in Europe at that time. 441 \nThe Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone of Australia is therefore coeval with the 442 \nRhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Interval Biozone of Powell (1992) in Europe. 443 \nIn summary, there is significant palynological evidence for the Rhaetian age of 444 \nthe Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica Zone of Australia. For example, the range bases of the 445 \ndinoflagellate cysts Beaumontella langii, Dapcodinium priscus, Heibergella 446 \nkendelbachia and Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica are within the Rhaetian in both Australia 447 \nand Europe (Fig. 6). Herein, the Australian range top of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica is 448 \nplaced slightly below the Rhaetian-Hettangian boundary.The range top of common 449 \nRhaetogonyaulax rhaetica is in the late Rhaetian and the top of the zone is placed at 450 \nthis point. 451 \n 452 \n4.1.6 The Dapcodinium priscus Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 453 \nThis zone is defined as the entire range of prominent Dapcodinium priscus. 454 \nThe base is also marked by the range tops of Rhaetogonyaulax wigginsii and 455 \nprominent Wanneria listeri and Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, and the range bases of 456 \nBeaumontella langii, Heibergella kendelbachia and Suessia sp. A (Helby et al., 457 \n19087a, fig. 8). Accessory forms comprise Beaumontella langii, Heibergella 458 \nkendelbachia, sparse Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, Suessia swabiana, Suessia sp. A and 459 \na low-diversity association of undescribed forms. Helby et al. (1987a) commented that 460 \nit is possible to subdivide this zone into two informal subzones. This was formalised 461 \n 20 \nby Backhouse and Balme (2002) who placed the Jurassic\/Triassic boundary at the top 462 \nof the lower subzone, coeval with the top of the Ashmoripollis reducta Spore-pollen 463 \nZone. Dinoflagellate cyst diversity is highest in the lower subzone, where other 464 \nTriassic species are present. By contrast, the upper subzone is characterised only by 465 \nthe index species; this is associated with the Corollina torosa Spore-pollen Zone of 466 \nHelby et al. (1987a) (Backhouse et al., 2002, fig. 9). As discussed above, Susadinium 467 \nsp. A. is now Susadinium? australis and occurs within the overlying Early Toarcian 468 \nLuehndea Assemblage of Riding and Helby (2001a). 469 \nThe Dapcodinium priscus Zone was considered to be of Middle Rhaetian to 470 \nLate Pliensbachian (possibly earliest Toarcian) age by Helby et al. (1987a, p. 15). 471 \nThis is based on the decline of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica at the base of the zone, and 472 \nthe incoming of abundant Dapcodinium priscus and Corollina within this interval (i.e. 473 \nat the top of the Ashmoripollis reducta Spore-pollen Zone). However, Corollina is 474 \nalso typically abundant in the Rhaetian of Europe (Morbey, 1978; Fig. 6). In both 475 \nAustralia and Europe, Dapcodinium priscus ranges from the latest Triassic into the 476 \nearliest Jurassic. In Europe it is most consistent in the Rhaetian and Hettangian, and is 477 \npresent only sporadically in the Early Sinemurian (Morbey, 1978; Feist-Burkhardt and 478 \nWille, 1992; Riding and Thomas, 1992). Therefore, based on a correlation with 479 \nEurope, the Dapcodinium priscus Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) is reinterpreted as 480 \nbeing of latest Rhaetian to Early Sinemurian age (Fig. 6). This accords with the 481 \nsituation in many well intervals in Australia, where in the Jurassic Dapcodinium 482 \npriscus is most common in the lowest part of the upper Dapcodinium priscus subzone 483 \nand is scarce in the highest part of its range. It is not recorded above the mid part of 484 \nthe Corollina torosa Spore-pollen Zone. The latest Rhaetian of Europe is 485 \ncharacterised by a marked decline in Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, and an increase in 486 \n 21 \nDapcodinium priscus (see Courtinat and Piriou, 2002). In summary, the base of the 487 \nDapcodinium priscus Zone of Australia is considered to be within the latest Rhaetian 488 \nbecause of a correlation with the decline in Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the Northern 489 \nHemisphere, and the virtually synchronous \u2018switchover\u2019 with Dapcodinium priscus 490 \n(Fig. 6). Other typical Triassic dinoflagellate cysts, notably Suessia swabiana and 491 \nHeibergella? kendelbachia, also occur in the lower Dapcodinium priscus subzone. 492 \nThe top of the Dapcodinium priscus Zone is interpreted herein to be of Early 493 \nSinemurian age based on correlation with the range of this species in Europe. Placing 494 \nthe top of the Dapcodinium priscus Zone at this point means that the Late Sinemurian 495 \nand most of the Pliensbachian interval are devoid of dinoflagellate cysts in Australia 496 \n(Figs. 6, 7). This situation is similar in the Northern Hemisphere, where the only 497 \nrecords of dinoflagellate cysts are monospecific assemblages of Liasidium variabile in 498 \nthe Late Sinemurian (Weiss, 1986; Brittain et al., 2010). 499 \n 500 \n4.2 The Luehndea Assemblage of Riding and Helby (2001a) 501 \nThe Luehndea Assemblage of Riding and Helby (2001a) represents a 502 \nsignificant addition to the zonation of Helby et al. (1987a) (Fig. 7). It is not placed 503 \ninto the scheme of dinoflagellate cyst superzones of Helby et al. (1987a) because it 504 \nrepresents a relatively short interval, and it is isolated from the subjacent and 505 \nsuperjacent dinoflagellate cyst successions by non-marine intervals (Foster, 2001, fig. 506 \n2; Helby et al., 2004). 507 \nThe Luehndea Assemblage is a distinctive, low-diversity dinoflagellate cyst 508 \nassemblage, which is present in the late Early Jurassic of the Timor Sea area and 509 \noffshore Western Australia. It is considered to be a marginal marine association. 510 \n 22 \nRiding and Helby (2001a) described an endemic flora of nine dinoflagellate cyst 511 \nspecies from the lower Plover Formation in the Jabiru and Skua oilfields of the Timor 512 \nSea. Two dinoflagellate cyst suites were recognised. These are the Susadinium? Suite, 513 \nwhich is succeeded by the more diverse Skuadinium Suite (Riding and Helby, 2001a, 514 \nfig. 12). The two subdivisions represent dinoflagellate cyst subzones 9Bii and 9Bi 515 \nrespectively of Foster (2001, fig. 2). These subzones were not used in the zonations of 516 \nHelby et al. (2004) and Partridge (2006) because it is not known if they, or the 517 \nKekryphalospora distincta Spore-pollen Zone of Foster (2001) and Riding and Helby 518 \n(2001a), can be recognised regionally. This brief influx of marine microplankton 519 \noverlies paralic strata, hence it is interpreted as representing a base level rise. This 520 \nwas probably the Early Toarcian global eustatic rise of Haq et al. (1987). Rare 521 \nspecimens of Luehndea have also been recovered from the Northern Carnarvon and 522 \nPerth basins and illustrates this Early Toarcian eustatic sea-level rise is probably more 523 \nwidely recognisable across the northern and western Australian basins than previously 524 \nthought. 525 \nThe interval which includes the Luehndea Assemblage was considered to be 526 \nearliest Toarcian by Helby et al. (1987a) based on the occurrence of Susadinium sp. A 527 \n(= Susadinium? australis). Riding and Helby (2001a) defined the assemblage and 528 \ncorrelated it to the Early Toarcian based on comparisons with European dinoflagellate 529 \ncyst genera. Specifically, the overlapping ranges of Luehndea and Susadinium?, 530 \ntogether with Mendicodinium and Nannoceratopsis, indicate that the assemblage is of 531 \nEarly Toarcian age (Morgenroth, 1970; Riding, 1987; Riding and Thomas, 1992; 532 \nBucefalo Palliani et al., 1997a,b; Bucefalo Palliani and Mattioli, 1998; Fig. 7). The 533 \nrecognition of Luehndea septata in samples up to 20-30 m below the entire Luehndea 534 \nAssemblage suite suggests the assemblage may, in part, range down into the latest 535 \n 23 \nPliensbachian (Fig. 7). The associated spore-pollen floras are entirely consistent with 536 \nthe Toarcian. In particular, the occurrence of the spore Kekryphalospora distincta 537 \nsupports this correlation (Fenton and Riding, 1987; Fig. 7). Riding and Helby (2001a) 538 \nalso stated that two samples from the Coojong-1 well in the Northern Carnarvon 539 \nBasin, earlier noted by Howe (2000) to be from the NJ5b and NJ6 calcareous 540 \nnannofossil zones, contained Luehndea Assemblage palynofloras. This provides 541 \nstrong independent evidence for the latest Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian age 542 \nassigned herein to the Luehndea Assemblage. 543 \n 544 \n4.3 The Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone of Helby et al. (1987a) 545 \nThe Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone was considered to be of Early 546 \nBajocian to earliest Oxfordian age, and is recognised in Western Australia, South 547 \nAustralia, northern Queensland and Papua New Guinea (Helby et al., 1987a). This 548 \nextensive distribution is due to the dominantly nearshore\/shallow marine nature of the 549 \nBajocian to lowermost Oxfordian strata of Australasia. The superzone is characterised 550 \nby the consistent occurrence of Pareodinia ceratophora and a diversification of 551 \ndinoflagellate cysts throughout. This radiation includes the inceptions of important 552 \ngonyaulacacean lineages, for example the range base of Wanaea in the Late Bajocian. 553 \nThe oldest subdivision, the Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone, represents a widespread 554 \nmarine transgression; this appears to be related to the Early Bajocian part of the LZA-555 \n1 Supercycle of Haq et al. (1987). This was followed by a regression during the Late 556 \nBajocian-Early Bathonian (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 46). Following this eustatic fall, 557 \nan apparently continuous record of marine palynomorphs throughout the Middle and 558 \nLate Jurassic and most of the Cretaceous was established (Helby et al., 1987a, figs. 559 \n45, 46). 560 \n 24 \nThe trend of a transition from low-diversity dinoflagellate cyst floras 561 \ndominated by genera such as Dissiliodinium, Nannoceratopsis and Pareodinia in the 562 \nBajocian, followed by a radiation of gonyaulacacean forms including the inceptions of 563 \ngenera with epicystal archaeopyles (e.g. Ctenidodinium and Wanaea) in the 564 \nBathonian, and further diversification during the Callovian and earliest Oxfordian is 565 \nglobal (Figs. 8, 9). This floral succession is observed throughout the Americas, 566 \nAustralasia, Europe and the Middle East (e.g. Johnson and Hills, 1974; Bujak and 567 \nWilliams, 1977; Davies, 1983; Woollam and Riding, 1983; Prauss, 1989; Conway, 568 \n1990; Poulsen, 1996; Quattrocchio et al., 1996). This evolutionary pattern is therefore 569 \nof high chronostratigraphical significance, albeit at a broad level of resolution. The 570 \nstratigraphical ranges of selected cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst taxa within this 571 \nSuperzone are illustrated as Figs. 8 and 9. 572 \n 573 \n4.3.1 The Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone of Helby et al. (1987a), revised by Helby et 574 \nal. (2004) 575 \nThe Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone was defined using the total range of 576 \nMeiourogonyaulax sp. A of Helby et al. (1987a). However, the definition of this Early 577 \nBajocian biozone was redefined by Helby et al. (2004) as the range of consistent 578 \nDissiliodinium caddaense. This was because the tripartite subdivision of the zone, 579 \nbased on an acme of Dissiliodinium caddaense in the middle part of the unit, noted by 580 \nHelby et al (1987a, fig. 15) cannot be recognised outside of the Perth Basin. Diversity 581 \nwas relatively low throughout the Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone; Helby et al. 582 \n(1987a, fig. 15) and Riding et al. (2010) reported twelve taxa. These include the long-583 \nranging Batiacasphaera spp., Nannoceratopsis spp., Pareodinia ceratophora, 584 \nPareodinia halosa and Pareodinia spp. The more restricted Dissiliodinium 585 \n 25 \ncaddaense, Dissiliodinium sp. (no antapical node) of Helby et al. (1987a), 586 \nMeiourogonyaulax sp. A, Nannoceratopsis deflandrei, Nannoceratopsis spiculata, 587 \nand Phallocysta erregulensis are also present. Acmes of Dissiliodinium caddaense 588 \nand Phallocysta erregulensis may be present in the middle part, and Dissiliodinium 589 \nsp. (no antapical node) characterises the upper part of the zone (Helby et al., 1987a, 590 \nfig. 15). 591 \nThe Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone is dated as Early Bajocian on the basis of 592 \nthe molluscan faunas of the Newmarracarra Limestone of the Champion Bay Group 593 \nand correlatives such as the Cadda Formation in the Perth Basin (Filatoff, 1975, p. 7, 594 \nfig. 2). Arkell and Playford (1954), Arkell (1956) and Playford et al. (1975) stated that 595 \nthe Newmarracarra Limestone faunas are referable to the early Bajocian Discites and 596 \nLaeviuscula chronozones, possibly extending into the Sauzei and Humphriesianum 597 \nchronozones. This was refined to the early Laeviuscula Chronozone (Westermann and 598 \nWang, 1988; Riding et al., 2010) on the basis of ammonite and strontium isotope 599 \nevidence from the Northern Carnarvon Basin (Tusk-1 and 2 wells). This tie point to 600 \nthe early Laeviuscula Chronozone is accurate and reliable; it is the best link to the 601 \nEuropean standard succession in the entire Jurassic of Australia. Foraminiferal data 602 \nare also consistent with the Early Bajocian (Apthorpe, 1994; 2003). Calcareous 603 \nnannofossils indicate a correlation with the uppermost NJ8 and NJ9 nannofossil 604 \nzones, which gives a Middle Aalenian to Early Bajocian age (Howe, 2000). Thus the 605 \nDissiliodinium caddaense Zone is interpreted herein to range from the base of the 606 \nBajocian to the top of the NJ9 Nannofossil Zone. Hence it encompasses the entire 607 \nLaeviuscula Chronozone. 608 \nIn terms of dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphy, Dissiliodinium spp., 609 \nNannoceratopsis spp., Pareodinia ceratophora, Pareodinia halosa and Wanaea sp. 610 \n 26 \nare known from the Early Bajocian of Europe (e.g. Fenton and Fisher, 1978; Fenton, 611 \n1981; Feist-Burkhardt, 1990; Riding et al., 1991; Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997; 612 \nFig. 8). Dissiliodinium, Pareodinia and Wanaea are especially significant because the 613 \nrange bases of these genera are typically Bajocian (Fig. 8). The range top of 614 \nNannoceratopsis deflandrei and the range base of Nannoceratopsis spiculata are both 615 \nEarly Bajocian (Stover, 1966; Gowland and Riding, 1991; Feist-Burkhardt and 616 \nMonteil, 1997), whilst the range base of Dissiliodinium is relatively concurrent in the 617 \nAalenian and Bajocian of Europe and Australasia, respectively (Fig. 8). Furthermore, 618 \nthe lack of diverse gonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts strongly suggests that this 619 \nzone is largely of Early Bajocian age (Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992, fig. 2; Feist-620 \nBurkhardt and Monteil, 1997, figs 4, 5). 621 \nPhallocysta erregulensis is confined to the Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone 622 \nand closely resembles Phallocysta elongata. The latter differing only in having a 623 \nconsistently smooth endocyst, a geniculate, type 3I, periarchaeopyle and being 624 \nsomewhat less variable in outline. Phallocysta elongata ranges from the latest 625 \nToarcian to the Early Bajocian in Europe (Riding, 1994) and hence in a 626 \nmorphostratigraphical sense, Phallocysta erregulensis is consistent with the Early 627 \nBajocian (Fig. 8). 628 \nA potential Middle Jurassic evolutionary lineage can be invoked in that 629 \nDissiliodinium caddaense appears be an evolutionary precursor of Wanaea. The 630 \nspecimens of Dissiliodinium caddaense illustrated by Stover and Helby (1987a, figs 631 \n4A-D) closely resemble the early, simple (energlynoid\/non-flanged) representatives of 632 \nWanaea, especially Wanaea verrucosa (see Riding and Helby, 2001b). Dissiliodinium 633 \nhas a multiplate (1-5P) polyplacoid precingular archaeopyle and Wanaea has an 634 \nepicystal archaeopyle. However, if the precingular plates in Dissiliodinium caddaense 635 \n 27 \ndid not separate laterally and apically (i.e. from the apical plate series), the 636 \narchaeopyle type would change from being polyplacoid precingular to epicystal. The 637 \nmorphologies are otherwise similar, so it seems possible that Wanaea originated in 638 \nthis way. This scenario is typical of the experimentation in archaeopyle styles in the 639 \nBajocian (Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 2001). 640 \n 641 \n4.3.2 The Nannoceratopsis deflandrei Zone of Foster (2001) and Helby et al. (2004) 642 \nThe Caddasphaera halosa Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) proved to be 643 \nsomewhat poorly defined and understood. Consequently, this unit was replaced by the 644 \nNannoceratopsis deflandrei and Wanaea verrucosa zones by Helby et al. (2004). 645 \nThese zones were defined on more distinctive taxa than the Caddasphaera halosa 646 \nZone. This strategy also allowed the closing of the stratigraphical gap in the zonation 647 \nbetween the Dissiliodinium caddaense and Caddasphaera halosa zones of Helby et 648 \nal. (1987a, fig. 15). 649 \nThe Nannoceratopsis deflandrei Zone of Helby et al. (2004) was defined as 650 \nthe interval between the range top of consistent Dissiliodinium caddaense and the 651 \nrange top of Nannoceratopsis deflandrei, together with the range base of Wanaea 652 \nverrucosa. Two divisions can be recognised based on the range base of \u2018spiny 653 \nvarieties\u2019 of Ctenidodinium (Helby et al., 2004, figs. 1, 4). This zone is characterised 654 \nby low diversity assemblages. These comprise Acanthaulax cf. crispa, 655 \nBatiacasphaera spp., Ctenidodinium spp. (spiny varieties), Dissiliodinium sp. (no 656 \nantapical node), Nannoceratopsis deflandrei, Nannoceratopsis cf. spiculata, 657 \nNannoceratopsis spp., Pareodinia ceratophora, Pareodinia halosa, Pareodinia spp., 658 \n 28 \nPhallocysta granosa and Scriniocassis sp. (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; unpublished 659 \ndata). 660 \nThe Nannoceratopsis deflandrei Zone was assigned to the Late Bajocian by 661 \nHelby et al. (2004, figs. 1, 4) and Partridge (2006). The only independent evidence of 662 \nthe age of this unit is from the calcareous nannofossil assemblages in the partially 663 \ncoeval Dictyotosporites complex Spore-pollen Zone. These suggest a correlation with 664 \nthe NJ9 or younger nannofossil zones (Howe, 2000) which are considered indicative 665 \nof an Early Bajocian or younger age. 666 \nThe presence of Acanthaulax cf. crispa, Ctenidodinium spp., Dissiliodinium 667 \nspp., Nannoceratopsis deflandrei, Nannoceratopsis cf. spiculata, Nannoceratopsis 668 \nspp. and Pareodinia spp. is consistent with a mid Bajocian age when compared to the 669 \nNorthern Hemisphere dinoflagellate cyst record (Fig. 8). For example, according to 670 \nFeist-Burkhardt and Monteil (1997, figs. 4,5), the range bases of Acanthaulax crispa, 671 \nCtenidodinium spp. and Nannoceratopsis spiculata, and the range top of 672 \nNannoceratopsis deflandrei (as Nannoceratopsis gracilis) lie close to the Early-Late 673 \nBajocian transition (Fig. 8). The presence of Scriniocassis sp. is also consistent with 674 \nthe Early-Late Bajocian transition (Riding and Thomas, 1992). The low-diversity 675 \nnature of the assemblages in the Nannoceratopsis deflandrei Zone is most similar to 676 \nEarly Bajocian of the Northern Hemisphere (Riding, 1987; Feist-Burkhardt, 1990; 677 \nRiding et al., 1991; Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997). 678 \nGiven that the underlying Dissiliodinium caddaense Zone is of unequivocal 679 \nEarly Bajocian age, the Nannoceratopsis deflandrei Zone is interpreted here as being 680 \nof late Early to Late Bajocian age due to evidence from calcareous nannofossils and 681 \ndinoflagellate cysts. On the basis of European dinoflagellate cyst ranges, this interval 682 \nincludes the Early-Late Bajocian transition. Hence the base of the Nannoceratopsis 683 \n 29 \ndeflandrei Zone has been extended into the Early Bajocian (Figs. 4, 8). This zone is 684 \nonly recognized in a small number of wells through what is normally a non-marine or 685 \nmarginal marine succession. 686 \n 687 \n4.3.3 The Wanaea verrucosa Zone of Foster (2001) and Helby et al. (2004) 688 \nThe Wanaea verrucosa Zone replaced the upper part (7ci) of the 689 \nCaddasphaera halosa Zone of Helby et al. (1987a). This zone is defined by the 690 \nstratigraphical range of Wanaea verrucosa. The base and top are also defined by the 691 \napparent extinction of Nannoceratopsis deflandrei and the inception of Wanaea 692 \nindotata respectively. 693 \nThis zone yields dinoflagellate cyst associations with a high diversity of 694 \nlargely undescribed species (R. Helby, personal communication). The described taxa 695 \ncomprise Batiacasphaera spp., Ctenidodinium ancorum, Endoscrinium kempiae, 696 \nNannoceratopsis spp., Pareodinia ceratophora, Pareodinia halosa, Pareodinia spp., 697 \nPhallocysta granosa, Ternia balmei, Valvaeodinium spinosum, Wanaea enoda, 698 \nWanaea lacuna and Wanaea verrucosa (see Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; Riding and 699 \nHelby, 2001b, figs. 11, 12; Helby et al., 2004; unpublished data). The diversity 700 \nincreases up-section, and the range bases of Valvaeodinium spinosum and 701 \nEndoscrinium kempiae define three subzones (Foster, 2001, fig. 2; Helby et al., 2004, 702 \nfig. 4; Partridge, 2006). 703 \nThe Wanaea verrucosa Zone or equivalents were assigned to the Early to 704 \nMiddle Bathonian, with no independent evidence (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 12; Helby 705 \net al., 2004, fig. 4; Partridge, 2006). In Europe, the occurrences of simple (non-706 \nflanged) species of Wanaea, in the absence of prominent Ctenidodinium spp. are 707 \n 30 \nindicative of the Late Bajocian (Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997, figs. 4, 5; Fig. 8). 708 \nCtenidodinium spp. are present in the Late Bajocian, however this genus became 709 \nprominent in the Early Bathonian in the Northern Hemisphere (Riding et al., 1985; 710 \nFeist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997, figs. 4, 5; Riding et al., 1999, fig. 15; Fig. 8). The 711 \nrange base of Valvaeodinium spinosum is typically close to the Early-Late Bajocian 712 \ntransition (Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997). Furthermore, specimens recorded in 713 \nthis zone as Endoscrinium luridum are similar in morphology to the European taxon 714 \nEndoscrinium asymmetricum. The range base of Endoscrinium asymmetricum is early 715 \nLate Bajocian (Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992, fig. 2), hence a correlation is 716 \neminently possible based on this morphostratigraphical evidence. 717 \nIn summary, the highly diverse yet largely undescribed assemblages from the 718 \nWanaea verrucosa Zone are far more characteristic of the Late Bajocian than the 719 \nBathonian based on comparisons with Europe. Hence, the Wanaea verrucosa Zone is 720 \nhere assigned to the Late Bajocian to Early Bathonian (Fig. 8). 721 \n 722 \n4.3.4 The Wanaea indotata Zone of of Helby et al. (1987a) 723 \nThe Wanaea indotata Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) is the interval between the 724 \nrange bases of Wanaea indotata and Wanaea digitata. There is an acme occurrence of 725 \nFusiformacysta challisiana in the middle of the zone. This zone typically yields 726 \nmoderately diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, including undescribed 727 \nmorphotypes. Aldorfia aldorfensis, Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, Ctenidodinium 728 \nancorum, Durotrigia spp., Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella spp., Endoscrinium kempiae, 729 \nEndoscrinium luridum, Fusiformacysta terniana, Glossodinium dimorphum, 730 \nLithodinia protothymosa, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Nummus apiculus (acritarch), 731 \n 31 \nrare Pareodinia ceratophora, Pareodinia halosa, Ternia balmei, Valvaeodinium 732 \nspinosum and rare Wanaea enoda are also present (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; Riding 733 \nand Helby, 2001b,d; Riding and Fensome, 2002, fig. 2; unpublished data). 734 \nThe Wanaea indotata Zone was given a latest Bathonian to earliest Callovian 735 \nage by Helby et al. (1987a). The base was revised to early Late Bathonian by Helby et 736 \nal. (2004) and Partridge (2006). The first occurrence of Wanaea digitata at the top of 737 \nthe zone was used as independent evidence by Helby et al. (1987a) to apply an earliest 738 \nCallovian age to this boundary. In Europe, this datum is intra-mid Callovian (Riley 739 \nand Fenton, 1982). Calcareous nannofossils from immediately below a horizon 740 \nreferable to the Wanaea indotata Zone in the Capella-1 well are ascribed by Howe 741 \n(2000) to the NJ11 calcareous nannofossil Zone. The NJ11 Zone, as utilised in the 742 \nNorthern Hemisphere, is latest Bajocian to early Late Bathonian and this represents 743 \nthe only independent age control for the Wanaea indotata Zone. 744 \nBy comparison with European dinoflagellate cyst floras, the Wanaea indotata 745 \nZone is highly unlikely be younger than Middle Callovian due to the absence of 746 \ncomplex flanged forms of Wanaea, Rigaudella aemula, Stephanelytron spp. and 747 \nconsistent Gonyaulacysta jurassica (see Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding and 748 \nThomas, 1997, fig. 2; Riding, 2005b; Fig. 8). The presence of forms such as Aldorfia 749 \naldorfensis, Ctenidodinium sellwoodii\/tenellum, Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella spp. and 750 \nKorystocysta spp. are highly characteristic of the Bathonian (Gocht, 1970; Riding et 751 \nal., 1985; Fig. 8). The Ctenidodinium sellwoodii\/tenellum group is especially 752 \nsignificant. In Europe, Ctenidodinium sellwoodii first occurs in the Bajocian and is 753 \nconsistently common to abundant throughout the Bathonian (Riding et al., 1985; 754 \n1991; Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997; Fig. 8). Similarly, in Australia, the range 755 \nbase of Ctenidodinium ancorum (similar morphotype to the Ctenidodinium 756 \n 32 \nsellwoodii\/tenellum complex) extends down to the upper Wanaea verrucosa Zone and 757 \nis consistently common through the Wanaea indotata to Ctenidodinium ancorum 758 \nzones (Riding and Helby, 2001d). These bioevents are considered to be broadly 759 \nsynchronous in the latest Bajocian to Bathonian of Europe and Australasia. Thus 760 \nsupporting a latest Bajocian age for the Wanaea verrucosa Zone and a Bathonian age 761 \nfor the Wanaea indotata Zone. The presence of Glossodinium dimorphum in this zone 762 \nis interesting. The range base of this species in the Northern Hemisphere is Middle 763 \nOxfordian (e.g. Riding and Thomas, 1992). Hence its range base is sigificantly older 764 \nin the Southern Hemisphere. 765 \nIn summary, the Wanaea indotata Zone is assigned herein to the late Early to 766 \nLate Bathonian on the basis of evidence from calcareous nannofossils and 767 \ndinoflagellate cysts. 768 \n 769 \n4.3.5 The Ternia balmei Zone of Helby et al. (2004) 770 \nThe Wanaea digitata and Rigaudella aemula zones of Helby et al. (1987a) 771 \nproved difficult to use due to widespread inconsistency in the recognition of the oldest 772 \noccurrence of Riguadella aemula between Australian basins due to facies differences 773 \n(Helby et al., 2004). The range base of Rigaudella aemula was used to delineate the 774 \nWanaea digitata and Rigaudella aemula zones by Helby et al. (1987a). Hence Helby 775 \net al. (2004) replaced these two zones with three new subdivisions, the largely 776 \nCallovian Ternia balmei, Voodooia tabulata and Ctenidodinium ancorum zones. This 777 \nwas deemed a better strategy than revising the existing zones. 778 \nThe Ternia balmei Zone replaced the Wanaea digitata Zone and the lower part 779 \n(subzones 7aiibii and 7aiibi) of the Rigaudella aemula Zone of Helby et al. (1987a). 780 \n 33 \nThe Ternia balmei Zone was defined as the interval between the range base of 781 \nWanaea digitata and the range top of Ternia balmei. The zone can be subdivided 782 \nusing the range bases of Riguadella aemula and Voodooia tabulata, the range top of 783 \nLithodinia protothymosa and the Durotrigia magna acme (Helby et al. (2004, figs 1, 784 \n3). 785 \nThe dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of the Ternia balmei Zone are 786 \nsignificantly more diverse than the underlying subdivisions. These associations 787 \ninclude the dinoflagellate cysts Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, Ctenidodinium 788 \nancorum, Ctenidodinium fuscibasilarum, Ctenidodinium planocristatum, Durotrigia 789 \nmagna, Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella spp., Fostericysta eclipsiana, Fusiformacysta 790 \nchallisiana, Glossodinium dimorphum, Gonyaulacysta jurassica, Lithodinia 791 \nprotothymosa, Meiourogonyaulax penitabulata, Meiourogonyaulax viriosa, 792 \nNannoceratopsis pellucida, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta spp., 793 \nPareodinia ceratophora, rare Pareodinia halosa, Rigaudella aemula, Tabulodiniun 794 \nsenarium, Ternia balmei, Tubotuberella dangeardii, Voodooia tabulata, prominent 795 \nWanaea digitata, Wanaea indotata, Woodinia pedis and Yalkalpodium elangiana (see 796 \nHelby et al., 1987a; Riding and Helby, 2001d; Riding and Fensome, 2002, fig. 2; 797 \nMantle 2009a,b; unpublished data). The acritarchs Nummus apiculus and Wuroia 798 \ncapnosa are also present. 799 \nThe Ternia balmei Zone was assigned to the Early to Late Callovian by Helby 800 \net al. (2004). Helby et al. (1988) described macrofaunas and palynofloras referable to 801 \nthe Ternia balmei Zone from the Oraka Sandstone of Kawhia, North Island, New 802 \nZealand. These authors assigned an undifferentiated Callovian age to this biota, 803 \nsignificantly emending the Late Callovian to Kimmeridgian age of Hudson et al. 804 \n(1987). The age of the Oraka Sandstone was also discussed by Stevens (1997, p. 97). 805 \n 34 \nCalcareous nannofossils provide only a rather imprecise Bathonian or younger age for 806 \nthe Ternia balmei Zone (Howe, 2000). 807 \nHelby et al. (1987a, fig. 12) used the European range base of Wanaea digitata 808 \nat the base of the Zone to derive a Middle Callovian age. The range base of complex 809 \nflanged forms of Wanaea (including Wanaea digitata) is Middle-Late Callovian in 810 \nEurope (Riley and Fenton, 1982; Riding and Thomas, 1992; Fig. 9). The inception of 811 \ndiverse dinoflagellate cysts including Atopodinium prostatum, Clathroctenocystis 812 \nasaphes, Gonyaulacysta eisenackii, consistent Gonyaulacysta jurassica, Limbodinium 813 \nabsidatum, Paragonyaulacysta spp., Rhynchodiniopsis cladophora, Rigaudella 814 \naemula, Sirmiodinium grossii, Stephanelytron spp. and Tubotuberella dangeardii are 815 \nindicative of the Callovian Stage in Europe (e.g. Riding, 1987; 2005b; Feist-Burkardt 816 \nand Wille, 1992; Martill et al., 1994; Riding and Thomas, 1992; 1997). A comparison 817 \nof these ranges with those for Australia is given in Fig. 9. For example the range base 818 \nof consistent Gonyaulacysta jurassica occurs close to the base of this zone in 819 \nAustralia (unpublished data). In Europe the range base of consistent records of this 820 \nspecies is in the Early-Middle Callovian (Riding et al., 1999; Fig. 9). The presence of 821 \nthe Ctenidodinium, Durotrigia and Meiourogonyaulax\/Lithodinia groups in the 822 \nTernia balmei Zone (Riding and Helby, 2001d) is further support for a Callovian age. 823 \nThese genera are prominent in the Callovian, and far less typical of the Oxfordian in 824 \nEurope (Fig. 9). Fostericysta eclipsiana is similar in morphology to Jansonia scarffei, 825 \nhowever the latter species is confined to the Middle-Late Bathonian (Tykoezinski et 826 \nal., 2000). 827 \nTo conclude, the Ternia balmei Zone is herein considered to be of Early to 828 \nMiddle Callovian age (Figs. 4, 9). 829 \n 830 \n 35 \n4.3.6 The Voodooia tabulata Zone of Helby et al. (2004) 831 \nThe Voodooia tabulata Zone replaced subzones 7aiiaii and 7aiiai from the 832 \nupper part of the Rigaudella aemula Zone of Helby et al. (1987a). It was defined as 833 \nthe interval between the range tops of Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata (Helby et 834 \nal., 2004, fig. 1). The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are extremely similar in both 835 \ndiversity and taxonomic spectrum to those from the underlying Ternia balmei Zone. 836 \nInceptions of Australasian species in this zone include Cygnusicysta talterniana, 837 \nSystematophora geminus, Tringadinium bjaerkei, Tringadinium comptum, 838 \nTubotuberella apatela and Woodinia bensonii (see Riding and Helby, 2001e). 839 \nThis unit was assigned to the Late Callovian by Helby et al. (2004). There are 840 \nno reliable macrofaunal ties for the Australian Callovian biozones, thus the 841 \ndinoflagellate cyst correlations for this and adjacent zones and the Early Oxfordian 842 \nmacrofaunal tie points for the immediately younger Wanaea spectabilis Zone provide 843 \nthe strongest evidence for a Late Callovian age for the Voodooia tabulata Zone. 844 \nThe dinoflagellate cyst correlations supporting this latest Callovian age are 845 \nrepresented by the diverse dinoflagellate cyst associations which include 846 \nstratigraphically significant and geographically widespread forms such as 847 \nAtopodinium prostatum, consistent Gonyaulacysta eisenackii, Gonyaulacysta 848 \njurassica, Limbodinium absidatum, Mendicodinium spp., Rhynchodiniopsis 849 \ncladophora, Rigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium dictyotum, Tabulodinium senarium, 850 \nTubotuberella apatela, Tubotuberella dangeardii and Wanaea digitata (see Davey, 851 \n1988; Helby et al., 1987a; unpublished data; Fig. 9). In Europe, there was a similar 852 \nsignificant increase in dinoflagellate cyst diversity in the Late Callovian, with many 853 \nimportant and characteristic taxa having inceptions (e.g. Riding and Thomas, 1992, 854 \nfig. 2.11). The presence of common Ctenidodinium, Lithodinia and 855 \n 36 \nMeiourogonyaulax in the Voodooia tabulata Zone is additional support for restricting 856 \nthis zone to the Late Callovian (see section 4.3.5). 857 \n 858 \n4.3.7 The Ctenidodinium ancorum Zone of Helby et al. (2004) 859 \nThe Ctenidodinium ancorum Zone was defined as the interval between the 860 \nrange top of Voodooia tabulata and the range base of Scriniodinium crystallinum 861 \n(Helby et al., 2004, figs. 1, 3; Partridge, 2006). The range top of Ctenidodinium 862 \nancorum marks the middle part of the zone (Helby et al., 2004, figs. 1, 3). However, 863 \nin a detailed study of nine wells from the Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, Mantle 864 \n(2009b) found that the last occurrences of Voodooia tabulata and Ctenidodinium 865 \nancorum were largely synchronous. In Undan-2, Voodooia tabulata was recorded 866 \nwith a younger last appearance datum than Ctenidodinium ancorum. Thus, the last 867 \nappearance datum of Voodooia tabulata may not always be a consistent boundary 868 \nmarker for the Ctenidodinium ancorum and Voodooia tabulata zones in the Timor Sea 869 \nregion. It may also be that the Callovian unconformity removed parts of the 870 \nCtenidodinium ancorum Zone. 871 \nThe Ctenidodinium ancorum Zone sensu Helby et al. 2004 replaced subzones 872 \n7aib and 7aia from the uppermost part of the Rigaudella aemula Zone of Helby et al. 873 \n(1987a). The 7aib assemblages are substantially similar to those in the underlying 874 \nVoodooia tabulata Zone although diversity is somewhat decreased (section 4.3.6; Fig. 875 \n9). However, the 7aia assemblages are essentially Wanaea spectabilis Zone 876 \nassemblages without Scriniodinium crystallinum. Mantle (2009b) considered that this 877 \nsubzone should represent the lowermost Wanaea spectabilis Zone. As the 878 \nCtenidodinium ancorum Zone appears somewhat ambiguously constrained, and is 879 \n 37 \ntypically a thin interval, further investigations may deem it necessary to place the 880 \nlower and upper portions of this zone into the Voodooia tabulata and Wanaea 881 \nspectabilis zones respectively. One endemic Australasian species with an inception in 882 \nthe currently accepted framework for this zone is that of rare Pyxidiella pandora. 883 \nThis unit was assigned to the Early Oxfordian by Helby et al. (2004). An 884 \nearliest Oxfordian age is consistent with the marked decrease in abundance of 885 \nCtenidodinium, Lithodinia and Meiourogonyaulax, as is also recorded in Europe (Fig. 886 \n9). Furthermore, the respective Late Callovian and Early Oxfordian ages of the 887 \nsubjacent Voodooia tabulata and the superjacent Wanaea spectabilis zones support 888 \nthe earliest Oxfordian age herein assigned to the Ctenidodinium ancorum Zone. 889 \n 890 \n4.4 The Pyxidiella Superzone of Helby et al. (1987a) 891 \nThe Pyxidiella Superzone of Helby et al. (1987a) was named after the Late 892 \nJurassic dinoflagellate cyst Pyxidiella pandora, and is based on the Dingodinium 893 \njurassicum Zone of Evans (1966). It comprises three dinoflagellate cyst zones, and 894 \nranges in age from the early Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian according to Helby et al. 895 \n(1987a; 2004) and Partridge (2006). The Superzone is characterised by abundant and 896 \ndiverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, with several important inceptions (Helby et 897 \nal., 1987a, fig. 15). Pyxidiella Superzone palynofloras are present across the North 898 \nWest Shelf and the Papuan Basin. The formation of grabens in the North West Shelf 899 \nled to the deposition of thick, organic-rich Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian sediments. By 900 \ncontrast, in areas unaffected by these tectonic controls, the coeval strata are thin and 901 \nintermittent. Organic-rich source rocks of this age were developed worldwide at this 902 \ntime (Miller, 1990). 903 \n 38 \n 904 \n4.4.1 The Wanaea spectabilis Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 905 \nThe Wanaea spectabilis Zone was defined as the interval between the range 906 \nbase of Scriniodinium crystallinum, and the range base of consistent Wanaea 907 \nclathrata (Helby et al., 1987a; 2004). Stratigraphically important datums within this 908 \nzone include the range tops of Fostericysta eclipsiana, Systematophora geminus, 909 \nWanaea digitata and consistent Microdinium jurassicum, the range bases of 910 \nDingodinium jurassicum, Gonyaulacysta ceratophora, Oligosphaeridium spp., 911 \nWanaea spectabilis and Wanaea talea, and acmes of Cygnusicysta talterniana, 912 \nOligosphaeridium spp., and Woodinia bensonii (Helby et al. 1987a; Riding and 913 \nHelby, 2001e; Helby et al., 2004, figs. 1, 3; Partridge, 2006). Helby (1987a, fig. 15) 914 \nillustrated Wanaea spectabilis as ranging throughout this biozone. This species is now 915 \ninterpreted as being confined to the upper part of this zone, with rare specimens 916 \npresent in the lowermost part of the Wanaea clathrata Zone (Riding and Helby, 917 \n2001b, figs. 11, 12; Helby et al., 2004, figs. 1, 3; Partridge, 2006). 918 \nThere is a marked increase in dinoflagellate cyst diversity at the base of this 919 \nzone with many specific inceptions (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15). Cosmopolitan taxa 920 \npresent in this zone include Chytroeisphaeridia cerastes, Clathroctenocystis asaphes, 921 \nEllipsoidictyum cinctum, Endoscrinium galeritum, Endoscrinium luridum, Fromea 922 \ntornatilis, Gonyaulacysta centriconnata, Gonyaulacysta eisenackii, Gonyaulacysta 923 \njurassica, Leptodinium ambiguum, Leptodinium mirabile, Limbodinium absidatum, 924 \nMendicodinium groenlandicum, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Pareodinia spp., 925 \nRhynchodiniopsis cladophora, Rigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium crystallinum, 926 \nScrinodinium dictyotum, Sentusidinium spp., Stephanelytron-Lagenadinium spp., 927 \nTubotuberella apatela, Tubotuberella dangeardii and Wanaea digitata\/fimbriata (see 928 \n 39 \nDavey, 1988; 1999; Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; Riding and Fensome, 2002, fig. 2; 929 \nunpublished data). Indigenous Australasian forms include Cassiculosphaeridia solida, 930 \nChlamydophorella wallala, Cygnusicysta talterniana (acme), Dingodinium 931 \njurassicum, Dingodinium swanense, Fostericysta eclipsiana, Fusiformacysta 932 \nchallisiana, Gonyaulacysta ceratophora, Microdinium jurassicum, Nummus 933 \ntithonicus (acritarch), Oligosphaeridium swanense, Productodinium chenii, 934 \nProlixosphaeridium capitatum, Pyxidiella pandora, Systematophora geminus, 935 \nTringadinium bjaerkei, Tringadinium comptum, Wanaea spectabilis, Wanaea talea, 936 \nWoodinia bensonii and Yalkalpodium elangiana (see Davey, 1988; Helby et al., 937 \n1987a; Riding and Helby, 2001b,d,e,f,g; Riding and Fensome, 2002). Hence the trend 938 \nof relatively high dinoflagellate cyst diversity initiated during the Late Callovian is 939 \ncontinued throughout the Oxfordian in both Australia and Europe. Wilson and Helby 940 \n(1987) described an Oxfordian dinoflagellate cyst association from North Canterbury, 941 \nNew Zealand which closely resembles both Australian and European Early-Middle 942 \nOxfordian palynofloras. 943 \nThe Wanaea spectabilis Zone was deemed to be Early to Middle Oxfordian by 944 \nHelby et al. (1987a, p. 29). Foster (2001, fig. 2), Helby et al. (2004) and Partridge 945 \n(2006) revised this to Early to Late Oxfordian. The Oxfordian correlation was based 946 \non unpublished ammonite evidence provided by W.J. Arkell (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 947 \n12). This material, from the Cape Range-1 well between 1620 and 1585 m, lies in the 948 \nmiddle part of the Wanaea spectabilis Zone (Helby and Powis, 1981). J. Backhouse 949 \n(unpublished data) noted that Helby et al. (1987a, p. 17) mistakenly attributed these 950 \nammonites to the Wanaea clathrata Zone. Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 86, figs. 951 \n7,8) stated that the ammonites in the Cape Range-1 well are large Perisphinctes sp., 952 \nand are possibly referable to the Middle Oxfordian Mayaites-Perisphinctes 953 \n 40 \nAssemblage of the Sula Islands, Indonesia (Arkell, 1956; McWhae et al., 1958). This 954 \nis broadly consistent with the Late Oxfordian ammonites from Kawhia, New Zealand 955 \nfound in two samples probably referable to the Wanaea spectabilis Zone (Helby et al., 956 \n1988). These two samples are from the base of the Ohineruru Formation which 957 \nStevens (1997) attributed to the Early Kimmeridgian but is now considered Middle 958 \nOxfordian (Campbell et al., 2004). Howe (2000) could only assign samples from this 959 \nzone to the NJ9 Nannofossil Zone or younger, which means an age no older than 960 \nBathonian. However, some samples from the Alaria-1 well yielded calcareous 961 \nnannofossil assemblages that are probably referable to the NJ15b and NJ16 962 \nnannofossil zones. This suggests, at least in part, a latest Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian 963 \nage. The interpretations of Francis and Westermann (1993, fig. 7) were adapted by 964 \nDavey (1999, p. 30), who concluded that the top of his LJ11 Zone is no younger than 965 \nMiddle Oxfordian. The majority of the non-dinoflagellate cyst biostratigraphical 966 \nevidence indicates a Middle-Late Oxfordian age for the Wanaea spectabilis Zone. 967 \nMany of the cosmopolitan taxa recorded in the Wanaea spectabilis Zone of 968 \nAustralia are characteristic of the Oxfordian in the Northern Hemisphere (see above). 969 \nExamples include Atopodinium prostatum, Clathroctenocystis asaphes, Endoscrinium 970 \ngaleritum, Fromea tornatilis, Gonyaulacysta centriconnata, Limbodinium absidatum, 971 \nRigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium crystallinum, Stephanelytron spp. and Wanaea 972 \ndigitata\/fimbriata (e.g. Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding and Thomas, 1992; 973 \nFig. 9). Specifically, Fromea tornatilis, Gonyaulacysta centriconnata, Limbodinium 974 \nabsidatum, Rigaudella aemula, and Wanaea digitata\/fimbriata are characteristic of 975 \nthe Early-Middle Oxfordian in Europe (Riding and Thomas, 1997; Riding et al., 1999; 976 \nRiding, 2005b). Davey (1988; 1999) recorded Wanaea digitata\/fimbriata from the 977 \nWanaea spectabilis Zone of Papua New Guinea; this species is a reliable Early 978 \n 41 \nOxfordian marker throughout the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Riding and Thomas, 979 \n1992). The prominent presence of Gonyaulacysta ceratophora in this interval is also 980 \nsignificant because this Australian species is similar in morphology to Gonyaulacysta 981 \njurassica subsp. adecta var. longicornis (Riding, 2005a). The latter is characteristic of 982 \nthe Early-Middle Oxfordian of Europe (Riding and Thomas, 1997; Riding, 2005b; 983 \nFig. 9). Additionally, the range bases of consistent Dingodinium, Leptodinium and 984 \nunequivocal Systematophora are markers for the Oxfordian; these genera are rare or 985 \nunknown from the Callovian in the Northern Hemisphere (Riding and Thomas, 1992). 986 \nHence the dinoflagellate cyst evidence for the Wanaea spectabilis Zone points to the 987 \nEarly-Middle Oxfordian. This is broadly consistent with Francis and Westermann 988 \n(1993, fig. 7), and compares with a Middle-Late Oxfordian age on the non-989 \ndinoflagellate cyst biotas (see above). 990 \nIn summary, on the balance of all the biotal evidence and the ages of the 991 \nadjacent zone, the Wanaea spectabilis Zone is interpreted as being of Early to early 992 \nLate Oxfordian age (Figs. 4, 9). 993 \n 994 \n4.4.2 The Wanaea clathrata Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 995 \nThe Wanaea clathrata Zone was defined as the interval between the range 996 \nbase of consistent Wanaea clathrata and the range top of Wanaea clathrata (Helby et 997 \nal. (1987a; 2004). The diverse accessory forms are substantially similar to those from 998 \nthe underlying Wanaea spectabilis Zone. However the range bases of Indodinium 999 \nkhariense, Striatodinium lineatum and Striatodinium ottii occur in this zone (Riding 1000 \nand Helby, 2001f). 1001 \n 42 \nThe Wanaea clathrata Zone was interpreted as latest Oxfordian to earliest 1002 \nKimmeridgian by Helby et al. (1987a; 2004), Foster (2001) and Partridge (2006). 1003 \nHelby et al. (1987a, fig. 19) indicated that the Kimmeridgian ammonites (Kossmatia 1004 \nsp.) and belemnites (Retroceramus galoi) are present in the upper part of the zone 1005 \n(Arkell, 1956; Balme, 1957; Wiseman, 1980). This material from the Cape Range-1 1006 \n(1316-1189 m) and Cape Range-2 (1380-1212 m) wells in the Carnarvon Basin was 1007 \nconsidered to be \u201cpossibly Middle or Early Kimmeridgian\u201d by Wiseman (1980). 1008 \nHowever, Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 86) asserted that the identification of 1009 \nKossmatia sp. is possibly a misidentification of the Late Oxfordian \u201cPerisphinctes\u201d 1010 \nsularus-moluccanus group (\u201cP. indicus\u201d). Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 81) also 1011 \ndescribed Middle or Late Oxfordian molluscan faunas from the Misool Islands, 1012 \nIndonesia associated with the Wanaea clathrata Zone. Consequently, Francis and 1013 \nWestermann (1993, fig. 7) assigned the Wanaea clathrata Zone to the Late Oxfordian. 1014 \nDavey (1988, fig. 3) also interpreted the Wanaea clathrata Zone as being Early-1015 \nMiddle Oxfordian on dinoflagellate cyst evidence; this was subsequently revised to 1016 \nMiddle-Late Oxfordian (Davey, 1999, figs 8, 9). However, Helby and Hasibuan 1017 \n(1988, fig.1, sample 64\/65) recorded bivalve (Malayomaorica malayomaorica) and 1018 \nbelemnite (Retroceramus haasti) species whose range overlap strongly supports an 1019 \nEarly Kimmeridgian age for the upper Wanaea clathrata Zone. Further evidence that 1020 \nthe Wanaea clathrata Zone is probably not wholly Oxfordian is provided by latest 1021 \nOxfordian to earliest Kimmeridgian calcareous nannofossils associated with the 1022 \nunderlying Wanaea spectabilis Zone (Howe, 2000). The overlying Dingodinium 1023 \nswanense Zone is rarely more than a few hundred metres thick and it would also 1024 \nappear exaggerated for it to span the entire Kimmeridgian. Although, the non-1025 \ndinoflagellate cyst biotal evidence for the age of the Wanaea clathrata Zone is 1026 \n 43 \nsomewhat problematical (see above) a Late Oxfordian to Early Kimmeridgian age is 1027 \nassigned herein (Figs. 4, 9). 1028 \nThe dinoflagellate cyst associations in the Wanaea clathrata Zone are 1029 \nsubstantially similar to those in the underlying Wanaea spectabilis Zone, and only 1030 \nmarginally lower in diversity (Davey, 1988, p. 30). This unit is distinguished by the 1031 \nprominent occurrence of Wanaea clathrata, to the virtual exclusion of all other 1032 \nspecies of Wanaea (Riding and Helby, 2001b, figs 11, 12). The lowered diversity 1033 \npartly reflects the absence of typically Early and Middle Oxfordian taxa such as 1034 \nFromea tornatilis, Limbodinium absidatum and Wanaea talea. Many of the species in 1035 \nthe Wanaea clathrata Zone are typical of the Middle and Late Oxfordian of the 1036 \nNorthern Hemisphere. These comprise Ellipsoidictyum cinctum, Endoscrinium 1037 \ngaleritum, Endoscrinium luridum, Gonyaulacysta jurassica, the Leptodinium 1038 \nambiguum-mirabile-subtile complex, Leptodinium spp., Mendicodinium 1039 \ngroenlandicum, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Rigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium 1040 \ncrystallinum, Scriniodinium dictyotum, Stephanelytron-Lagenadinium spp., 1041 \nSystematophora spp., Tubotuberella apatela and Tubotuberella dangeardii (see Helby 1042 \net al., 1987a; Davey, 1988; Riding and Fensome, 2002; unpublished data; Fig. 9). An 1043 \nimportant occurrence is that of Endoscrinium luridum in Papua New Guinea (Davey, 1044 \n1988, fig. 14); the range base of this species marks the Middle Oxfordian in Europe 1045 \n(Riding and Thomas, 1992; 1997). The range top of Endoscrinium galeritum also 1046 \noccurs within the zone (Riding and Fensome, 2002). In the Northern Hemisphere, this 1047 \nbioevent is normally in the Late Oxfordian (Partington et al., 1993; Riding et al., 1048 \n1999, fig. 25). The presence of consistent Dingodinium and Leptodinium is also 1049 \nhighly characteristic of the Oxfordian. Wanaea fimbriata is present in the Wanaea 1050 \nclathrata Zone in Papua New Guinea (Davey, 1988; unpublished data). However the 1051 \n 44 \nrange top of Wanaea fimbriata lies in the Early Oxfordian of Europe (e.g. Riding, 1052 \n1984; 1987). A similar apparent incoherency is that, in Europe, the range top of 1053 \nWanaea spp. lies at the Early-Middle Oxfordian transition (e.g. Riding and Thomas, 1054 \n1992). Hence this important genus has a significantly younger range top in Australasia 1055 \n(Helby et al., 1987a; Riding and Helby, 2001b, fig. 12; Fig. 9). Despite these 1056 \nanomalies, the Wanaea clathrata Zone is here attributed to the Late Oxfordian to 1057 \nEarly Kimmeridgian. This slightly extends the base of the zone as depicted by Helby 1058 \net al. (2004) and Partridge (2006) but is in close agreement with the initial publication 1059 \n(Helby et al., 1987a). The key lines of evidence are the dinoflagellate cyst 1060 \nassociations (in particular the range top of Endoscrinium galeritum and the range base 1061 \nof rare Cribroperidinium spp.), coupled with the probable Late Oxfordian ammonites 1062 \nfrom Western Australia, the Middle Oxfordian to Early Kimmeridgian molluscan 1063 \nfaunas from Indonesia and the ages of the adjacent zones. 1064 \n 1065 \n4.4.3 The Dingodinium swanense Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 1066 \nThe Dingodinium swanense Zone was defined as the interval between the 1067 \nrange tops of Wanaea clathrata and Dingodinium swanense by Helby et al. (1987a; 1068 \n2004) and Partridge (2006). Dingodinium swanense is frequently abundant in the 1069 \nupper part, and Tubotuberella missilis is confined to the middle part of this zone 1070 \n(Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; Helby et al., 2004, fig. 1). Craspedodinium swanense and 1071 \nCribroperidinium corrugatum are also confined to this unit (Riding and Helby, 1072 \n2001f). The range bases of Endoscrinium irregulare, Gonyaulacysta fenestrata, 1073 \nGonyaulacysta cf. fenestrata, Hadriana cincta and Mombasadinium parvelatum, 1074 \ntogether with the range tops of Oligosphaeridium swanense, Rhynchodiniopsis 1075 \n 45 \ncladophora, Striatodinium lineatum and Striatodinium ottii occur in this zone (Riding 1076 \nand Helby, 2001f). 1077 \nThe marine microplankton associations are significantly similar in content and 1078 \nrelative proportions to those from the underlying Wanaea clathrata Zone. The 1079 \naccessory forms are diverse, and include Cassiculosphaeridia solida, Cygnusicysta 1080 \ntalterniana, Dingodinium jurassicum, Egmontodinium cf. torynum, Gonyaulacysta 1081 \nceratophora, Indodinium khariense, Leptodinium ambiguum, Leptodinium mirabile, 1082 \nNannoceratopsis pellucida, Nummus tithonicus (acritarch), Oligosphaeridium cf. 1083 \ndiluculum, Pareodinia ceratophora, Peridictyocysta mirabilis, Productodinium 1084 \nchenii, Prolixosphaeridium capitatum, Pyxidiella pandora, Rigaudella aemula, 1085 \nScriniodinium crystallinum, Tringadinium bjaerkei and Tubotuberella missilis (see 1086 \nDavey, 1988; 1999; Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 15; Riding and Helby, 2001f,g; 1087 \nunpublished data).  1088 \nThe Dingodinium swanense Zone was considered to be Kimmeridgian by 1089 \nHelby et al. (1987a, p. 29; 2004) without independent evidence. However, Davey 1090 \n(1988, fig. 3; 1999, figs. 8, 9) stated that the equivalent of this zone, the lower part of 1091 \nhis Cribroperidinium perforans Zone, is Late Oxfordian based on the occurrence of 1092 \ncommon Scriniodinium crystallinum. This evidence is deemed to be questionable 1093 \nbecause the range top of this species in the Southern Hemisphere is apparently 1094 \nTithonian, i.e. significantly younger than Late Oxfordian (Riding and Fensome, 2002, 1095 \nfig. 2). Francis and Westermann (1993, fig. 7) correlated this zone to the latest 1096 \nOxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian based on molluscan evidence. Helby et al. (1988) 1097 \nidentified the Dingodinium swanense Zone in the Waikutakuta Siltstone and the 1098 \nKowhai Point Siltstone of Kawhia, New Zealand. These lithostratigraphical units 1099 \nwere dated as ?late Early Kimmeridgian and Late Kimmeridgian using radiolaria 1100 \n 46 \n(Aita and Grant-Mackie, 1992) and ammonites (Stevens, 1997). Samples from the 1101 \nDingodinium swanense Zone in the Alaria-1 well yielded calcareous nannofossils 1102 \ncharacteristic of the Early Tithonian (Howe, 2000). Clearly, the biostratigraphical 1103 \nevidence for the age of the Dingodinium swanense Zone is somewhat incoherent. 1104 \nEndemism between the Northern and Southern hemispheres was relatively 1105 \nmarked during this interval. However, cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cysts present in the 1106 \nDingodinium swanense Zone include Endoscrinium luridum, Leptodinium ambiguum-1107 \nmirabile-subtile, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Rhynchodiniopsis cladophora, 1108 \nRigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium crystallinum and Tubotuberella dangeardii. This 1109 \nassociation is characteristic of the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian interval (e.g. Riding and 1110 \nThomas, 1988; 1992; 1997; Riding, 2005b; Fig. 10). Based on this association, 1111 \nparticularly the occurrences of species such as Leptodinium ambiguum, Leptodinium 1112 \nmirabile, Rhynchodiniopsis cladophora and Tubotuberella dangeardii, the 1113 \ndinoflagellate cyst data for the Dingodinium swanense Zone is considered to support a 1114 \nKimmeridgian rather than a Tithonian age. 1115 \nTo summarise, the Dingodinium swanense Zone is deemed to be of Early to 1116 \nLate Kimmeridgian age based on dinoflagellate cysts, molluscs and radiolaria, and the 1117 \nages of the adjacent zones. 1118 \n 1119 \n4.5 The Fromea cylindrica Superzone of Helby et al. (1987a) (pars) 1120 \nThe Fromea cylindrica Superzone is based on the Cannosphaeropsis 1121 \nmirabilis-Cannosphaeropsis mirabilis\/Scriniodinium attadalense zones of Evans 1122 \n(1966), and comprises nine zones ranging in age from Early Tithonian to Early 1123 \nValanginian (Helby et al., 2004; Partridge, 2006). Helby et al. (1987a, fig. 11) 1124 \n 47 \ncompared the zones to the six surfaces and units II to V of Wiseman (1979; 1980, 1125 \nrespectively). The four oldest zones are considered herein. Helby et al. (2004) 1126 \ncommented that the high level of biostratigraphical resolution in this Early Tithonian 1127 \nto earliest Berriasian interval gives an average duration for a single subzone of 1128 \napproximately 250,000 years. The superzone is developed throughout the offshore 1129 \nbasins of north and west Australia and Papua New Guinea in a wide variety of 1130 \ndepositional settings where Helby et al. (1987a) considered it to be characterised by 1131 \nthe 'often prominent occurrence of Belodinium dysculum, Egmontodinium torynum, 1132 \nFromea cylindrica and Peridictyocysta mirabilis'. However the abundance of these 1133 \nspecies varies across the region and they are rather uncommon marker species in some 1134 \nbasins. 1135 \nThe Fromea cylindrica Superzone is dominated by endemic Australasian 1136 \ndinoflagellate cysts. The intense provincialism around the Jurassic-Cretaceous 1137 \ntransition reflects a regressive regime (Haq et al., 1987); the endemism affected most 1138 \nfossil groups (Casey, 1973; Abbink et al., 2001 and references therein). Cosmopolitan 1139 \ndinoflagellate cysts are distinctly subordinate, and some geographically-widespread 1140 \nspecies appear to have disparate stratigraphical ranges between the hemispheres. 1141 \nHence this interval appears to represent the maximum incoherence in terms of species 1142 \ncontent and biostratigraphy between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Within 1143 \nthe Northern Hemisphere, there was also some provincialism between the 1144 \ndinoflagellate cysts in the Boreal and Tethyan provinces at this time (Fisher and 1145 \nRiley, 1980; Dodekova, 1994). 1146 \n 1147 \n4.5.1 The Cribroperidinium perforans Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 1148 \n 48 \nThe Cribroperidinium perforans Zone was defined as the interval between the 1149 \nrange top of Dingodinium swanense and the range base of Omatia montgomeryi 1150 \n(Helby et al., 1987a). Supplemental datums within this zone include the range bases 1151 \nof Belodinium dysculum, Belodinium nereidis, Belowicysta balteus, Belowicysta sp. A 1152 \nand Peridictyocysta mirabilis (Helby et al. 1987a; Riding and Helby, 2001g), and the 1153 \nrange tops of Gonyaulacysta fenestrata, Hadriana cincta, Indodinium khariense and 1154 \nMombasadinium parvelatum (Helby et al., 1987a; 2004, fig. 2; Riding & Helby, 1155 \n2001f). The range tops of the acme occurrences of Cribroperidinium perforans and 1156 \nImpletosphaeridium pachydermum in the lower and upper parts of the zone 1157 \nrespectively allow the delineation of three subdivisions (Helby et al, 1987a, fig. 21; 1158 \nHelby et al., 2004, fig. 2). 1159 \n Helby et al. (1987a) reported that the diversity in this zone is moderate. 1160 \nFurther accessory forms include Cassiculosphaeridia solida, Dingodinium 1161 \njurassicum, Endoscrinium irregulare, Fromea cylindrica, Gonyaulacysta 1162 \nceratophora, Impletosphaeridium pachydermum, Leptodinium eumorphum, 1163 \nMeiourogonyaulax bulloidea, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Nummus tithonicus 1164 \n(acritarch), Pareodinia ceratophora, Pyxidiella pandora, prominent Rigaudella 1165 \naemula and Scriniodinium crystallinum (see Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21; Riding and 1166 \nHelby, 2001f,g). 1167 \nThe Cribroperidinium perforans Zone was assigned to the earliest Tithonian 1168 \nby Helby et al. (1987a; fig 19). This is supported by belemnite and bivalve evidence 1169 \nfrom three wells in Papua New Guinea which indicates a Late Oxfordian to Early 1170 \nTithonian age for this zone (Stevens, 1965; Helby et al., 1987a, appendix 3). Helby et 1171 \nal. (1987a) also commented that the reports of Cribroperidinium? perforans from the 1172 \nNorthern Hemisphere by Williams (1977) and Sarjeant (1979) are of Early Tithonian 1173 \n 49 \nage. Cribroperidinium is abundant and diverse throughout the Kimmeridgian and 1174 \nTithonian of the Northern Hemisphere, however, the European range of 1175 \nCribroperidinium? perforans is not deemed to be especially biostratigraphically 1176 \nsignificant (Cookson and Eisenack, 1958; Below, 1981). 1177 \nThis interval has been interpreted as being significantly older than earliest 1178 \nTithonian; Davey (1988; 1999) and Burger (1996) assigned it to the Late Oxfordian. 1179 \nFrancis and Westermann (1993) placed the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone in the 1180 \nEarly Kimmeridgian. However, Helby and Hasibuan (1988) and Francis and 1181 \nWestermann (1993, p. 81, 87) reported that palynofloras from the ?uppermost 1182 \nCribroperidinium perforans Zone and the Omatia montgomeryi Zone in Misool, 1183 \nIndonesia are associated with ammonites, belemnites and calcareous nannofossils of 1184 \nKimmeridgian-earliest Tithonian aspect. Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 86) also 1185 \nmentioned a considerable body of ammonite evidence from Kawhia, New Zealand 1186 \nwhich indicates an Early Tithonian age for the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone 1187 \n(Helby et al., 1988). However, Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 86) stated that there 1188 \nis some doubt as to the identification of these ammonites. Subsequently, the ammonite 1189 \ndata from New Zealand associated with the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone was 1190 \nreviewed by Stevens (1997). The key material is from the lower Kinohaku Siltstone to 1191 \nthe lower Puti Siltstone near Kawhia from which an Early Tithonian age was 1192 \nestablished (Stevens, 1997; Campbell et al., 2004). Because this New Zealand 1193 \nmaterial is from only part of the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone, this unit is 1194 \nconsidered to be at least partly Early Tithonian. This is entirely consistent with the 1195 \nbivalve-belemnite data evidence from Papua New Guinea (Stevens, 1965) and 1196 \nmacrofaunal data from Misool (Helby and Hasibuan, 1988; Francis and Westermann, 1197 \n1993). 1198 \n 50 \n There are few stratigraphically useful cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst datums 1199 \nwithin the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone of Australasia. The range top of 1200 \nLeptodinium spp. is within this unit in Papua New Guinea (Davey, 1988), and this 1201 \ndatum is broadly consistent with Europe. Intriguingly, the Cribroperidinium 1202 \nperforans Zone lies stratigraphically below the range tops of Endoscrinium luridum, 1203 \nNannoceratopsis pellucida and Scriniodinium crystallinum (Fig. 11). These datums 1204 \nare characteristically Kimmeridgian in Europe (Woollam and Riding, 1983; Riding 1205 \nand Thomas, 1988). In Papua New Guinea, the above taxa coexist with forms which 1206 \ntypically have range bases in the Tithonian-Berriasian such as Cyclonephelium spp., 1207 \nHistiophora sp., Oligosphaeridium diluculum and Stiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum 1208 \n(see Davey, 1988; 1999; Fig. 10). These forms do not overlap with Endoscrinium 1209 \nluridum and the other Kimmeridgian forms in Europe (Riding and Thomas, 1988). 1210 \nThe apparently younger ranges may be due to genuine heterochroneity or reworking. 1211 \nSignificant reworking events of Middle to Late Jurassic sediments are well known 1212 \nacross the North West Shelf (Bint and Marshall, 1994; unpublished data). 1213 \nTaking consideration of the biostratigraphical evidence from calcareous 1214 \nnannofossils, dinoflagellate cysts and molluscs, together with the the ages of the 1215 \nadjacent zones, the Cribroperidinium perforans Zone is interpreted herein as being of 1216 \nearliest Tithonian age, while acknowledging that the zone may also be partly 1217 \nKimmeridgian in age. 1218 \n 1219 \n4.5.2 The Omatia montgomeryi Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 1220 \nThe Omatia montgomeryi Zone represents the interval between the range base 1221 \nof Omatia montgomeryi (equivalent to the range tops of Gonyaulacysta fenestrata and 1222 \n 51 \nHadriana cincta), and the range tops of Omatia montgomeryi, Belowicysta balteus 1223 \nand Belowicysta sp. A of Riding and Helby (2001g) (Helby et al., 1987a; 2004, fig. 2). 1224 \nThe entire range of the acme occurrence of Omatia montgomeryi is present in the 1225 \nmiddle part of the zone, and this allows the delineation of three subdivisions (Helby et 1226 \nal, 1987a, fig. 21; Helby et al., 2004, fig. 2). 1227 \nThe dinoflagellate cyst diversity in this zone is moderate to high. Forms 1228 \ntypically present include Batiacasphaera spp., Belodinium dysculum, Belodinium 1229 \nnereidis, Cassiculosphaeridia solida, Cribroperidinium spp., prominent Dingodinium 1230 \njurassicum, Endoscrinium irregulare, Fistulacysta simplex, Fromea cylindrica, 1231 \nGonyaulacysta jurassica, prominent Herendeenia pisciformis, Impletosphaeridium 1232 \npachydermum, Komewuia glabra, Leptodinium eumorphum, Meiourogonyaulax 1233 \nbulloidea, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Nummus similis (acritarch), Nummus tithonicus 1234 \n(acritarch), Oligosphaeridium cf. diluculum, Omatia montgomeryi, Pareodinia 1235 \nceratophora, Peridictyocysta mirabilis, Pyxidiella pandora, prominent Rigaudella 1236 \naemula, Scriniodinium crystallinum, Sentusidinium spp. and Systematophora palmula 1237 \n(Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21; Davey, 1988; 1999; Riding and Helby, 2001g). 1238 \nThe Omatia montgomeryi Zone was assigned to the Early Tithonian by Helby 1239 \net al. (1987a, fig. 19) based on the ages of adjacent zones with no independent 1240 \nevidence. Other workers, however, have interpreted it as being significantly older. It 1241 \nwas assigned to the Late Oxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian by Davey (1988) and Burger 1242 \n(1996), and to the Early Kimmeridgian by Davey (1999). Francis and Westermann 1243 \n(1993, p.87) placed this unit largely in the Late Kimmeridgian; however, these authors 1244 \nadmitted that this age assessment was somewhat tentative, being interpolated between 1245 \nLate Oxfordian and Early Tithonian correlation points. Helby and Hasibuan (1988) 1246 \nand Francis and Westermann (1993, p. 81, 87) also reported that dinoflagellate cysts 1247 \n 52 \nof the Omatia montgomeryi Zone in Misool, Indonesia have been found together with 1248 \nKimmeridgian-earliest Tithonian calcareous nannofossils and molluscs. The 1249 \ncalcareous nannofossils are indicative of the Watznauria communis Nannofossil Zone 1250 \n(Francis and Westermann, 1993). Ammonite data from New Zealand associated with 1251 \nthe Omatia montgomeryi Zone (Helby et al., 1988) are considered by Stevens (1997) 1252 \nto be indicative of the Early Tithonian. Samples f8628 and f8625 of Helby et al. 1253 \n(1988), both from the Puti Siltstone, are referable to the Omatia montgomeryi Zone. 1254 \nThe Early Tithonian ammonite data of Stevens (1997) is based on widespread 1255 \nmaterial from the Himalayas, Madagascar and Mexico. Further support for a late 1256 \nEarly Tithonian age comes from Indian ammonite assemblages. Garg et al. (2003) 1257 \nrecovered dinoflagellate cysts typical of the Omatia montgomeryi Zone from a 1258 \nHildoglochiceras-Virgatosphinctes ammonite assemblage in northern Indian Tethyan 1259 \nsuccessions. 1260 \nThe range top of common\/consistent Scriniodinium crystallinum occurs in 1261 \nAustralia and Papua New Guinea within the Omatia montgomeryi Zone, and 1262 \nEndoscrinium luridum, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, Rigaudella aemula, 1263 \nStephanelytron scarburghense and Tubotuberella dangeardii are also present (Helby 1264 \net al., 1987a, fig. 21; Davey, 1988; 1999; Figs. 10, 11). These species all have 1265 \nKimmeridgian range tops in Europe (Riding and Thomas, 1988), hence appear to 1266 \nrange stratigraphically higher in the Southern Hemisphere. Some of these occurrences 1267 \nmay be due to extensive reworking. The macrofaunal evidence for the Early Tithonian 1268 \nappears to be robust, due to the presence of dinoflagellate cysts from Papua New 1269 \nGuinea which are typical of the Tithonian-Berriasian interval such as Circulodinium 1270 \ncompta, Cyclonephelium spp., Histiophora sp., Oligosphaeridium diluculum and 1271 \nStiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum (see Davey, 1988; 1999). 1272 \n 53 \nFollowing review of the available biostratigraphical evidence and the ages of 1273 \nthe adjacent zones, the Omatia montgomeryi Zone is interpreted herein as being 1274 \nwholly within the Early Tithonian (Figs. 4, 10). 1275 \n 1276 \n4.5.3 The Dingodinium jurassicum Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 1277 \nThe Dingodinium jurassicum Zone is the interval between the range tops of 1278 \nOmatia montgomeryi, Belowicysta balteus and Belowicysta sp. A of Riding and Helby 1279 \n(2001g), and the range top of the acme occurrence of Nummus similis (Helby et al., 1280 \n2004, fig. 2). This zone can potentially be resolved into ten subdivisions based on the 1281 \nrange tops of Batiacasphaera crassicingulata (acme), Cassiculosphaeridia solida 1282 \n(acme), Carnarvonodinium striatigranulatum, Atopodinium sp., Carnarvonodinium 1283 \nmorganii (acme), Bonbonadinium granulatum and Belodinium nereidis (acme), and 1284 \nthe range bases of Bonbonadinium granulatum, Belodinium nereidis (acme), Balcattia 1285 \ncheleusis, Dissimulidinium purattense and Rhynchodiniopsis serrata (acme) (Helby et 1286 \nal., 2004, fig. 2). 1287 \nDinoflagellate cyst diversity in the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone is high 1288 \naccording to Helby et al. (1987a). Other forms typically present include Aidelocysta 1289 \nclavata, Ampulladinium variabile, Balcattia cheleusis, Belodinium dysculum, 1290 \nBiorbifera ferox, rare Bourkidinium granulatum, Broomea simplex, Circulodinium 1291 \ndensebarbatum, prominent Dingodinium jurassicum, Egmontodinium torynum, 1292 \nEndoscrinium irregulare, Fromea cylindrica, Impletosphaeridium pachydermum, 1293 \nprominent Komewuia glabra, Leptodinium eumorphum, Meiourogonyaulax bulloidea, 1294 \nMeiourogonyaulax diaphana, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, prominent Nummus similis 1295 \n(acritarch), Nummus tithonicus (acritarch), Omatidinium amphiacanthum, 1296 \n 54 \nPapuadinium apiculatum, Pareodinia ceratophora, Peridictyocysta mirabilis, 1297 \nPerisseiasphaeridium inusitatum, Pyxidiella pandora, Rigaudella aemula, prominent 1298 \nRhynchodiniopsis serrata, abundant Sentusidinium spp., Sirmiodinium grossii 1299 \n(triangular variety), Stanfordella granulosa, Systematophora areolata, 1300 \nSystematophora palmula and Valensiella delicata (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21; Bint 1301 \nand Marshall, 1994, fig. 4; Riding and Helby, 2001g). 1302 \nThe Dingodinium jurassicum Zone is of late Early- early Late Tithonian age 1303 \naccording to Helby et al. (1987a, p. 31, 39); this is supported by macrofaunal evidence 1304 \n(Teichert, 1940; Brunnschweiler, 1954; 1960; Stevens, 1965; Playford et al., 1975). 1305 \nHowever, molluscan assemblages recovered from the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone 1306 \nof the Canning Basin, Western Australia and Papua New Guinea are solely Early 1307 \nTithonian (Helby et al., 1987a, appendix 3). Whilst, the buchid bivalve and belemnite 1308 \nassemblages associated with the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone from 3801.5 m in the 1309 \nOmati-1 well, Papua New Guinea, and from 360.9 m in the Broome-3 well, Western 1310 \nAustralia were reinterpreted as latest Kimmeridgian to late Early Tithonian by Francis 1311 \nand Westermann (1993, p. 85, 86). 1312 \nOther reports have assigned an older age to this interval, however these age 1313 \ndifferences are not as significant as in the subjacent zones. Davey (1988) placed the 1314 \nequivalent interval, which was subdivided into five dinoflagellate cyst zones, into the 1315 \nEarly Kimmeridgian to late Early Tithonian. Davey (1999, fig. 8) subsequently 1316 \nrevised this to Early Kimmeridgian-Earliest Tithonian and changed the parameters of 1317 \nthe zone. Welsh (1990, p. 378, 379) assigned the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone to the 1318 \nKimmeridgian to Middle Tithonian. This author stated that the four lowermost zones 1319 \nof Davey (1988) are difficult to recognise in Papua New Guinea, and reclassified 1320 \nthem as subzones of the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone. The correlations of Davey 1321 \n 55 \n(1988; 1999) and Welsh (1990) were all based on a succession of range tops of key 1322 \nEuropean dinoflagellate cyst markers. Burger (1996) deemed this zone to be Middle 1323 \nKimmeridgian to Early Tithonian. 1324 \nSnape (1992) reported Dingodinium jurassicum Zone dinoflagellate cyst 1325 \nassociations from the Antarctic Peninsula that occur with Tithonian ammonites 1326 \n(Whitham and Doyle, 1989). A correlation to the Late Kimmeridgian-Early Tithonian 1327 \nwas preferred by Francis and Westermann (1993), who stated that dinoflagellate cyst 1328 \nAssemblage B described by Jain et al. (1984) from the Spiti Shale of Malla Johar, 1329 \nnorthern India is referable to the uppermost Dingodinium jurassicum Zone. This 1330 \nequates to the earliest Tithonian Torquatisphinctes-Aulacosphinctoides ammonite 1331 \nassemblage. However, Garg et al. (2003) carried out further investigations on 1332 \ndinoflagellate cyst assemblages recovered directly from the fine-grained matrix 1333 \nof\/from ammonites collected in the same region. Their work suggests a late Early 1334 \nTithonian age for the Omatia montgomeryi Zone; this requires a younger age for the 1335 \noverlying Dingodinium jurassicum Zone. The range base of the spore genus 1336 \nCicatricosisporites\/Ruffordiaspora within the Spiti Shale succession further supports 1337 \nthe Tithonian age (Jain et al., 1984; Vijaya and Kumar, 2002). Francis and 1338 \nWestermann (1993) mentioned occurrences of the mid Tithonian ammonite Uhligites 1339 \nassociated with the lower part of the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone from New 1340 \nZealand (Bradshaw and Challinor, 1992). Stevens (1997) also noted a late Early 1341 \nTithonian age for the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone for ammonites from the Puti 1342 \nSiltstone, New Zealand. 1343 \nThere are few potentially significant cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst species 1344 \nin the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone in Australia (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21). 1345 \nHowever, Rigaudella aemula is present and the range top of consistent 1346 \n 56 \nNannoceratopsis pellucida occurs in Australia and Papua New Guinea within this 1347 \nzone. Additionally, Endoscrinium luridum, rare Scriniodinium crystallinum, 1348 \nStephanelytron spp. and Tubotuberella dangeardii are also present (Helby et al., 1349 \n1987a, fig. 21; Davey, 1988; 1999; Fig. 10). These all have range tops in the 1350 \nKimmeridgian of Europe (Riding and Thomas, 1988), hence appear to range 1351 \nsignificantly younger in the Southern Hemisphere. It is possible that some of these 1352 \noccurrences represent reworking. The occurrences of typically Tithonian-Berriasian 1353 \ndinoflagellate cysts in this zone, in Australia and Papua New Guinea, is consistent 1354 \nwith the evidence from macrofossils for a mid Tithonian age. These include 1355 \nBatioladinium sp., Circulodinium compta, Circulodinium densebarbatum, common 1356 \nCribroperidinium spp., Cyclonephelium spp., Endoscrinium attadalense, 1357 \nKleithriasphaeridium sp., Oligosphaeridium diluculum, rare Scriniodinium 1358 \ncampanula, Stiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum, Systematophora palmula, 1359 \nTanyosphaeridium spp., and Valensiella delicata (see Davey, 1988; 1999). 1360 \nIn conclusion, the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone is considered herein to be of 1361 \nlate Early to early Late Tithonian age due to macrofossil evidence from Antarctica, 1362 \nNew Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Western Australia, data from key European 1363 \ndinoflagellate cyst markers, together with the Early Tithonian and Late Tithonian-1364 \nearliest Berriasian ages of the immediately adjacent zones. 1365 \n 1366 \n4.5.4 The Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone of Helby et al. (1987a) 1367 \nThe Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone represents the interval between the range 1368 \ntop of the acme occurrence of Nummus similis, and the range top of Pseudoceratium 1369 \niehiense (Helby et al., 1987a; 2004, fig. 2). This interval can potentially be subdivided 1370 \n 57 \ninto eight subzones. These are based on the range tops of frequent Circulodinium 1371 \ndensebarbatum, frequent Rhynchodiniopsis serrata, Balcattia cheleusis, frequent 1372 \nPerisseiasphaeridium inusitatum, Nummus tithonicus (acme), Circulodinium 1373 \ndensebarbatum, Biorbifera ferox, Dissimulidinium purattense and Gardodinium 1374 \nangustum. The key range bases are Nummus tithonicus (acme), consistent 1375 \nImbatodinium kondratjevii, consistent Pseudoceratium iehiense and 1376 \nClathroctenocystis calabaza (Helby et al., 2004, fig. 2). 1377 \nHelby (1987a, p. 39, fig. 21) defined this zone as the total range of 1378 \nPseudoceratium iehiense. However, Helby et al. (2004) commented that the range 1379 \nbase of Pseudoceratium iehiense is extremely rare or completely absent in the older 1380 \npart of its range, i.e. in the lower part of this zone. This datum would be close to the 1381 \nJurasssic-Cretaceous transition. Bint and Marshall (1994) adjusted their Dingodinium 1382 \njurassicum-Pseudoceratium iehiense zonal boundary to reflect this. Helby et al. 1383 \n(2004) retained the original extents of these zones and used the range top of the 1384 \nNummus similis acme to define the base of the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone. 1385 \nThe trend of relatively high marine microplankton diversity is maintained in 1386 \nthe Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone (Helby et al., 1987a). Accessory forms not listed 1387 \nabove include Aidelocysta clavata, Ampulladinium variabile, Batioladinium 1388 \npaeminosum, Batioladinium radiculatum, Belodinium dysculum, Belodinium nereidis, 1389 \nBourkidinium granulatum, Broomea simplex, rare Carnarvonodinium morganii, 1390 \nDingodinium jurassicum, Egmontodinium torynum, Endoscrinium irregulare, 1391 \nFlamingoia cometa, Fromea cylindrica, Impletosphaeridium pachydermum, Kalyptea 1392 \nwisemaniae, Leptodinium eumorphum, Meiourogonyaulax bulloidea, 1393 \nMeiourogonyaulax diaphana, Nummus similis (acritarch), Omatidinium 1394 \namphiacanthum, Papuadinium apiculatum, Peridictyocysta mirabilis, 1395 \n 58 \nPseudoceratium robustum, Pseudoceratium weymouthense, Pyxidiella pandora, 1396 \nRigaudella aemula, prominent Sentusidinium spp., Sirmiodinium grossii (triangular 1397 \nvariety), Stanfordella granulosa, Systematophora areolata, Systematophora palmula, 1398 \nTubotuberella vlamingii and Valensiella delicata (see Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21; 1399 \nDavey, 1988; Bint and Marshall, 1994, fig. 4; Riding and Helby, 2001g). 1400 \nHelby et al. (1987a, p. 39) assigned the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone to the 1401 \nLate Tithonian to Early Berriasian. The Late Tithonian range base of the spore genus 1402 \nCicatricosisporites\/Ruffordiaspora in Europe was used as independent evidence for 1403 \nthe age of the middle part of this zone. This conclusion was endorsed by Davey (1988, 1404 \np. 27) and Backhouse (1988). Cicatricosisporites is prominent in the latest Jurassic 1405 \nand Early Cretaceous of Europe (Batten, 1996; Davey, 1999; Tiwari, 1999a,b). 1406 \nHowever, it is possible that this datum is diachronous due to migrations from low to 1407 \nhigh palaeolatitudes in both hemispheres (Dettmann and Playford, 1969; Burger, 1408 \n1990). This means that the genus appeared earlier, probably during the Kimmeridgian 1409 \nin the Great Artesian Basin and during the Tithonian in the Canning and Carnarvon 1410 \nbasins (Burger, 1989). Sajjadi and Playford (2002a,b) placed this datum in the mid 1411 \nTithonian of the Eromanga Basin. There is limited macrofossil data in the latest 1412 \nTithonian to Hauterivian of Australia. However, Helby et al. (1987a, appendix 3) 1413 \nrecorded Valanginian to Hauterivian macrofaunas from Papua New Guinea associated 1414 \nwith the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone; these appear to be anomalously young. Bint 1415 \nand Marshall (1994) reported that zircon crystals from a series of altered volcanic ash 1416 \nbeds at the top of the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone from the Wanaea-2 well in the 1417 \noffshore Northern Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia yielded earliest Cretaceous 1418 \nradiometric ages. 1419 \n 59 \nSome authors have attributed a slightly older, entirely Tithonian, age to this 1420 \ninterval. Davey (1988; 1999) assigned the equivalent interval to the Pseudoceratium 1421 \niehiense Zone to the late Early-Late Tithonian. The lowermost part of the 1422 \nPseudoceratium iehiense Zone has also been identified in the Sula Islands, Indonesia 1423 \nin ammonite and bivalve-rich beds (Francis and Westermann, 1993). These strata are 1424 \npart of the latest Tithonian-earliest Berriasian Blandfordiceras-Haplophylloceras-1425 \nHimalayatidae ammonite assemblage. Welsh (1990, figs 1, 2) assigned the 1426 \nPseudoceratium iehiense Zone to the latest Tithonian, and Burger (1996) deemed this 1427 \nunit to be Early-Late Tithonian in age. 1428 \nThe only \u2018anomalously young\u2019 Late Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst species 1429 \npresent in this unit is Rigaudella aemula (Helby et al., 1987a, fig. 21; Davey, 1988 1430 \nfigs. 6, 14). The range top of this species is Middle Oxfordian in Europe (e.g. Riding, 1431 \n2005b). Some of the Tithonian occurrences in the Southern Hemisphere probably 1432 \nrepresent reworking (Davey, 1988, fig. 6). There are certain potentially significant 1433 \ncosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst datums in the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone in 1434 \nAustralia. The presence of Ctenidodinium culmulum is consistent with the Late 1435 \nTithonian-earliest Berriasian of Europe (Woollam and Riding, 1983). The occurrence 1436 \nof Imbatodinium kondratjevii also supports the Tithonian age of this zone (Bint and 1437 \nMarshall, 1994, fig. 4; Fig. 10). Riding et al. (1999, fig. 26) reported Imbatodinium 1438 \nspp., including Imbatodinium kondratjevii, from the Tithonian of the Moscow Basin, 1439 \nRussia. Another bioevent which may be useful is the oldest occurrence of 1440 \n'pseudoceratioid' dinoflagellate cysts. These are genera such as Muderongia, 1441 \nPhoberocysta and Pseudoceratium which closely resemble the modern genus 1442 \nCeratium (see Wall and Evitt, 1975). In the Northern Hemisphere, Muderongia 1443 \nsimplex (= Muderongia sp. A of Davey, 1979) occurs in the Late Tithonian (Riding et 1444 \n 60 \nal., 2000; Fig. 10). In the Southern Hemisphere, Pseudoceratium iehiense, 1445 \nPseudoceratium robustum and Pseudoceratium weymouthense occur in the same 1446 \ninterval (Bint and Marshall, 1994). It seems likely that these synchronous ranges are 1447 \nbiostratigraphically significant (Fig. 10). Stevens (1987, p. 195) commented on the 1448 \nmorphological similarities between Scriniodinium prolatum from offshore Western 1449 \nAustralia and Scriniodinium pharo from Europe. These two species are large, and 1450 \nhave well-developed apical horns; they are both present around the Jurassic-1451 \nCretaceous transition (Riding and Fensome, 2002, fig. 2; Fig. 10). Other typically 1452 \nTithonian-Berriasian dinoflagellate cysts in the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone include 1453 \nCassiculosphaeridia spp., Circulodinium densebarbatum, Cribroperidinium spp., 1454 \nCyclonephelium spp., Endoscrinium attadalense, Oligosphaeridium diluculum, rare 1455 \nScriniodinium campanula, Stiphrosphaeridium dictyophorum, Systematophora 1456 \npalmula, Tanyosphaeridium spp. and Valensiella delicata (see Davey, 1982; 1988; 1457 \n1999; Heilmann-Clausen, 1987; Fig. 10). 1458 \nIn conclusion, the Pseudoceratium iehiense Zone is considered herein to be of 1459 \nLate Tithonian-Early Berriasian age based on the macrofossil evidence of Francis and 1460 \nWestermann (1993), various palynological data, the radiometric dating of Bint and 1461 \nMarshall (1994) and the mid Tithonian and Early Berriasian ages of the adjacent 1462 \nzones (Helby et al., 1987a; 2004; Partridge, 2006). 1463 \n 1464 \n5 Brief overview of Triassic-Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst provincialism 1465 \n Because the majority of dinoflagellates are marine, motile, planktonic and 1466 \nunicellular, dinoflagellate cysts have potentially extremely wide geographical 1467 \ndistributions. Several Triassic-Jurassic species such as Dapcodinium priscus, 1468 \n 61 \nGlossodinium dimorphum, Gonyaulacysta jurassica, Nannoceratopsis pellucida, 1469 \nRhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, Rigaudella aemula, Scriniodinium crystallinum, Suessia 1470 \nswabiana and Systematophora areolata are cosmopolitan. There are also large floral 1471 \nsimilarities at higher taxonomic levels, in addition to notable morphological 1472 \nsimilarities and trends. The cosmopolitan forms quoted above are also 1473 \nstratigraphically significant. They can therefore help in interregional correlation, 1474 \nassuming that any heterochroneity associated with, for example, slow migrations over 1475 \ntheir global distribution and major reworking events are not significant. 1476 \n The Triassic-Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst succession is substantially 1477 \nsimilar over much of the Northern Hemisphere, i.e. the Americas, Europe, the Middle 1478 \nEast, Russia and western Asia (Riding and Ioannides, 1996). For example, Jurassic 1479 \nmarine palynofloras from the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina are closely comparable with 1480 \ncoeval assemblages from Europe (Quattrocchio and Volkheimer, 1990; Quattrocchio 1481 \net al., 2007). No endemic Australasian taxa have been recorded from South America. 1482 \nBy contrast, there are significant proportions of endemic taxa in Australasia. These 1483 \ninclude Belowicysta balteus, Dissiliodinium caddaense, Hadriana cincta, 1484 \nSahulidinium ottii, Skuadinium spp., Ternia balmei, Tringadinium bjaerkei, 1485 \nTubotuberella missilis and Woodinia pedis. These forms may have had specific 1486 \ntolerances in terms of palaeolatitude, palaeotemperature etc., which confined them to 1487 \nsoutheast Tethys. This endemism, and some apparent stratigraphical incoherency, 1488 \nmeans that the correlation of the Australian zones to their European counterparts is 1489 \nnot straightforward. Despite the endemism, the partial global continuity gives 1490 \nmicrofossil groups such as dinoflagellate cysts a marked advantage over macrofossil 1491 \ngroups including the ammonites, which weare by comparison intensely provincial.1492 \n There appears to have been major floral differences between western and 1493 \n 62 \neastern Tethys during the Triassic and Jurassic. In the west (i.e. eastern North 1494 \nAmerica, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East) the dinoflagellate cyst 1495 \nassociations are markedly different to coeval assemblages from eastern Tethys (i.e. 1496 \nAustralasia, eastern Asia and northeastern India). This scenario is mirrored by other 1497 \nfossil groups, in which this pan-Tethyan endemism is significantly more profound. 1498 \nThe strongest eastern Tethyan ties exist between Australia, Indonesian, New Zealand 1499 \nand Papua New Guinea where many of the dinoflagellate cyst zones are workable 1500 \nacross the whole region. However, there are also marked similarities between Late 1501 \nJurassic Australasian\/Indonesian palynofloras and those recorded in east Africa (Jiang 1502 \net al. 1992, Schrank 2005, Msaky, 2007), India (Jain et al. 1984, Garg et al. 2003), 1503 \nand Madagascar (Chen, 1978, 1982). These include many species which are rarely or 1504 \nnever recorded in European assemblages, including: Broomea ramosa, Broomea 1505 \nsimplex, Carnarvonodinium morganii, Cribroperidinium perforans, Dingodinium 1506 \njurassicum, Indodinium khariense, Komewuia glabra, Mombasadinium parvelatum, 1507 \nNummus similis (acritarch), Omatia montgomeryi, Productodinium chenii, Wanaea 1508 \nclathrata, and Wanaea spectabilis. Most of these palynofloras also share considerable 1509 \nsimilarities with European palynofloras, thus they are potentially important tie points 1510 \nbetween European and Australian dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. However, better 1511 \nindependent age control of these assemblages is required before they can be reliably 1512 \ncorrelated. The northern Indian assemblages have further issues regarding reworking, 1513 \nmarginal preservation and the complex, structural terrain with associated stratigraphic 1514 \nuncertainties. 1515 \n Despite the limited marine circulation between the western Tethys and the 1516 \nPacific through the Central American Seaway during the Triassic and Jurassic, the 1517 \nTethys circumglobal current (TCC) flowed westwards in tropical palaeolatitudes 1518 \n 63 \n(Bush, 1997). Because of the gentle temperature gradient between the tropics and the 1519 \npoles during Mesozoic greenhouse conditions, north-south currents were much 1520 \nweaker than today. This also means that oceanic upwelling would have been 1521 \nsuppressed in comparison to that during icehouse conditions. The westward flow of 1522 \nthe TCC would have tended to aid migrations of planktonic organisms from eastern to 1523 \nwestern Tethys during this interval. However, endemic Australasian dinoflagellate 1524 \ncyst taxa have not been recorded west of east Africa and India (Jiang et al., 1992; 1525 \nGarg, et al., 2003). It is possible that the continuity of shelfal palaeoenvironments, 1526 \npartially stagnant oceans and\/or unknown latitudinal, temperature or other constraints 1527 \nprevented the westward migration of endemic Austral dinoflagellate cysts. 1528 \n There are far more published data on Triassic-Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts 1529 \nfrom Europe and adjacent regions than in Australasia and eastern Asia. Southern 1530 \nHemisphere studies on measured sections with detailed sample-by-sample 1531 \ninformation such as the report on the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous 1532 \nsuccessions of Papua New Guinea by Davey (1988) are few. It is clear that the 1533 \nrelative lack of detailed (quantitative) published records across Australia and New 1534 \nZealand is a major impediment to in-depth comparisons with coeval floras elsewhere 1535 \nin the world. Meaningful comparisons require similar datsets. Efforts need to be made 1536 \nto disseminate detailed palynological records through key released well sections in the 1537 \nNorth West Shelf to allow biotal similarities and differences to be objectively and 1538 \ncomprehensively assessed. 1539 \n 1540 \n6 Conclusions 1541 \n 64 \nThis study has comprehensively and objectively reviewed the 1542 \nchronstratigraphical extents of the Middle Triassic (Ladinian) to earliest Cretaceous 1543 \n(earliest Berriasian) dinoflagellate cyst zones established by Helby et al. (1987a; 1544 \n2004), Riding and Helby (2001a) and Partridge (2006) for the North West Shelf of 1545 \nAustralia. When available, non-palynomorph fossil groups are used to independently 1546 \ntie these zones to the geological timescale. The stratigraphical ranges of key 1547 \nAustralasian dinoflagellate cysts are also compared to the more tightly constrained 1548 \nEuropean zones to help confirm these tie points. A summary of the confirmed and 1549 \nreinterpreted ages of the 20 dinoflagellate cyst zones and one dinoflagellate cyst 1550 \nassemblage is given in Figs. 3, 4. 1551 \nThe main reinterpretations pertaining to the Rhaetogonyaulax Superzone of 1552 \nHelby et al. (1987a) is that its stratigraphical extent is now considered to be Ladinian 1553 \nto Early Sinemurian. By contrast, Helby et al. (1987a) illustrated this unit as being 1554 \nLate Anisian to Late Pliensbachian (Fig. 3). The oldest occurrences of 1555 \nRhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the Late Triassic, and the presence of Dapcodinium 1556 \npriscus in the absence of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica in the earliest Jurassic appear to 1557 \nhave widespread correlative significance (Fig. 6). In Europe and Australasia, they 1558 \nindicate the earliest Rhaetian and Hettangian-Early Sinemurian respectively. As a 1559 \nconsequence of this, the age of the Dapcodinium priscus Zone is considered herein to 1560 \nbe latest Rhaetian to Early Sinemurian in age (Fig. 3). It is clear that facies variations 1561 \nstrongly influenced the stratigraphical distribution of marine palynomorphs during the 1562 \nTriassic and Early Jurassic. Major eustatic shifts and marine transgressions appeared 1563 \nto have controlled certain bioevents. More taxonomic work is required before global 1564 \nprovincialism can be comprehensively assessed for the Middle-Late Triassic and 1565 \nacross the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. 1566 \n 65 \nThe Luehndea Assemblage of Riding and Helby (2001a) is a low-diversity 1567 \ndinoflagellate cyst assemblage which was developed in marginal marine conditions in 1568 \nthe Timor Sea and offshore Western Australia. It can be subdivided into two subzones 1569 \nand is interpreted as being of latest Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian age, The 1570 \nAssemblage probably reflects the Early Toarcian eustatic rise. 1571 \nThe Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone represents the inception of the 1572 \ncontinuous, gonyaulacacean-dominated, dinoflagellate cyst record in Australia. The 1573 \nsuperzone is well represented, despite the paralic nature of much of the strata of this 1574 \nage in Australia. The superzone includes seven zones, all of which appear to be 1575 \nslightly older than were interpreted by Helby et al. (1987a). The Middle Jurassic was 1576 \na critical phase in the general trends of dinoflagellate cyst evolution. The record of the 1577 \nmajor lineages in Australia is similar to that in the Northern Hemisphere. 1578 \nGonyaulacacean forms became established in the low-diversity Bajocian floras and 1579 \nrapidly diversified through the succeeding Bathonian and Callovian stages. The oldest 1580 \nsubdivision of the Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone, the Dissiliodinium caddaense 1581 \nZone, is interpreted to be Early Bajocian in age rather than Early-Late Bajocian 1582 \n(Helby et al., 1987a) based on reliable evidence from dinoflagellate cysts, 1583 \nnannofossils and strontium isotopes. The lack of ammonites and paucity of 1584 \nnannofossil data require the use of cosmopolitan dinoflagellate cyst species as the 1585 \nmajor tie points throughout the remainder of the Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone. 1586 \nThe occurrence of simple (non-flanged) Wanaea spp. in the absence of prominent 1587 \nCtenidodinium spp. supports a Late Bajocian age for the base of the Wanaea 1588 \nverrucosa Zone. The Wanaea indotata Zone is interpreted as earliest to Late 1589 \nBathonian in age on dinoflagellate cyst and nannofossil evidence. The remaining three 1590 \nzones in the Pareodinia ceratophora Superzone lack good independent control points, 1591 \n 66 \nalthough the most reliable dinoflagellate cyst bioevents for correlation to Europe are 1592 \nthe large decreases in Ctenidodinium spp. and Meiourogonyaulax-Lithodonia spp. in 1593 \nthe earliest Oxfordian, thus supporting this age for the Ctenidodinium ancorum Zone. 1594 \nThe three zones of the Pyxidiella Superzone are Early Oxfordian to 1595 \nKimmeridgian in age, as proposed by Helby et al. (1987a). The only changes to the 1596 \nages of these zones are the slightly older bases for the Wanaea spectabilis and 1597 \nWanaea clathrata zones. The Superzone is characterised by diverse dinoflagellate 1598 \ncyst associations and is well-developed in Western Australia, the Timor Sea region 1599 \nand the Papuan Basin. The oldest subdivision is the Wanaea spectabilis Zone, marked 1600 \nby an increase in dinoflagellate cyst diversity, and dated as Early Oxfordian to 1601 \nprobably intra Late Oxfordian. This is consistent with ammonite faunas from 1602 \nIndonesia, New Zealand, and the Northern Carnarvon Basin. A latest Oxfordian to 1603 \nearliest Kimmeridgian age is suggested for the Wanaea clathrata Zone on the basis of 1604 \nsomewhat slender dinoflagellate cyst and molluscan evidence. The Dingodinium 1605 \nswanense Zone is interpreted as being intra Early to Late Kimmeridgian based on 1606 \nmolluscan, nannofossil and radiolarian ages. 1607 \nThe Fromea cylindrica Superzone is developed throughout Australasia and 1608 \nincludes nine subdivisions, of which the four Jurassic zones are considered herein. 1609 \nThe Superzone is dominated by endemic dinoflagellate cysts and this interval 1610 \nrepresents the maximum global stratigraphical incoherence. This reflects a global 1611 \ntrend towards endemism at this time, caused by a generally regressive eustatic regime. 1612 \nThe Cribroperidinium perforans Zone is interpreted as being earliest Tithonian. The 1613 \nlate Early Tithonian age for the Omatia montgomeryi Zone is supported by ammonite 1614 \ndata. The most convincing independent ages for the Dingodinium jurassicum Zone are 1615 \nfrom ammonite assemblages in New Zealand and Antarctica. The zone is considered 1616 \n 67 \nto be late Early to Late Tithonian in age. The base of the Pseudoceratium iehiense 1617 \nZone is placed within the Late Tithonian based on macrofaunal, palynological and 1618 \nradiometric evidence. The upper part of the zone lies in the Early Berriasian. 1619 \n 1620 \nAcknowledgements 1621 \nThis contribution is part of a joint British Geological Survey (BGS) and Geoscience 1622 \nAustralia (GA) research programme under the auspices of the Virtual Centre of 1623 \nEconomic Micropalaeontology and Palynology (VCEMP).
