INTRODUCTION\nOPTICAL transmission in long-haul fiber systems in-corporating cascaded erbium-doped fiber amplifiers\n(EDFAs) is limited by the accumulated amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE) noise. All-optical 2R regeneration using\npassive saturable absorbers (SAs) is of interest as a means of\nreducing the noise accumulation and extending the error-free\ntransmission distance [1].\nSemiconductor SAs incorporating multiple-quantum wells\n(MQWs) exhibit strong nonlinear absorption response to\noptical power, as the photogenerated free-carrier population\nbuilds up in the MQW region, resulting in an absorption\ndecrease when the input power increases above a threshold.\nOvercoming the long (nanosecond) absorption recovery time\nof such SAs by introducing defects in the MQW region via\nlow-temperature molecular beam epitaxy [2], high-energy ion\nimplantation [3], or Fe-doping [4] is required in order to make\nsuch devices usable in high bit-rate transmission systems.\nImproved system performance has been reported when fast SAs\nwere incorporated at the amplification points [5], [6], while\nan increase in transmission distance from 1300 to 7600 km\nfor a BER in a 40-Gb\/s system was recently\ndemonstrated when the SA was combined with a nonlinear\nfiber [7]. However, application of SAs in systems with long\nManuscript received May 8, 2003; revised October 13, 2003.

Structure of the SA.\nspans of standard single-mode fiber (SMF) and conventional\ndispersion compensation has not yet been demonstrated. For\n10-Gb\/s transmission systems without regeneration operating\nat 1550 nm and incorporating dispersion compensated standard\nfiber with 75-km amplifier spacings, error-free transmission\ndistances up to 2500 km have been demonstrated [8], [9].\nRecently, we developed an MQW SA monolithically inte-\ngrated in a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity and implanted with nitrogen ions\nat an energy of 4 MeV. By incorporating the SA in a 40-Gb\/s\nsystem, we demonstrated ASE noise suppression on \u201czero\u201d bits\n[10]. In this letter, we use the same device in combination with a\nnonlinear fiber and an optical filter to control amplitude fluctua-\ntions on \u201cone\u201d bits, thereby forming a 2R all-optical regenerator\n[11]. We demonstrate 10-Gb\/s error-free transmission improve-\nment to over 7000 km in a dispersion compensated SMF recir-\nculating loop with an amplifier spacing of 80 km, when the 2R\nregenerator is included in the system.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM\nThe SA incorporates an MQW active layer formed by 50\nInGaAsP m quantum wells, separated by InGaAsP\nm barriers, grown by metal\u2013organic vapor phase\nepitaxy (Fig. 1). To increase the contrast ratio, the device is op-\nerated in reflection and the MQW layer is integrated in an asym-\nmetric Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity [2], [12]. The cavity is formed by\nthe top air\u2013semiconductor interface and a 16-period InGaAsP\n1041-1135\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Experimental configuration.\nm \/InP distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). The de-\nsign of the cavity requires that the front and the effective back\nreflections interfere destructively at the wavelength of the MQW\nexcitonic absorption peak, when the input power is low. To sat-\nisfy this condition, InP spacer layers are used above and below\nthe MQW, adjusting the optical path length through the SA to in-\nduce a -phase shift of the back reflection compared to the front\nreflection at the required wavelength. Under these conditions, if\nthe input power is increased, the MQW excitonic absorption is\nbleached, and the back reflection becomes dominant, leading to\nincreased overall device reflectivity. By operating at normal in-\ncidence, the device is made polarization insensitive.\nTo reduce the absorption recovery time of the SA, implan-\ntation of nitrogen ions was performed at 4 MeV energy and\n200 C temperature, using a dose of 3 10 cm . At this\nenergy, the ions pass through the MQW layer and stop in the\nfirst layers of the DBR, as calculated using the simulation pro-\ngram SRIM-2000 [13]. However, defects generated along the\nion traces act as photocarrier trapping and recombination cen-\nters, thereby reducing the absorption recovery time, while pre-\nserving the nonlinear absorption of the MQW. A pump-probe\ntechnique using 2-ps pulses at 4-MHz repetition rate was used\nto measure the recovery time of the SA. The as-grown material\nhad a 1\/e absorption recovery time of 3 ns, which was reduced to\nless than 5 ps after implantation. Measurements of the transfer\nfunction of the SA with input pulse energy at 4-MHz repetition\nrate indicated a contrast ratio of 7.5 dB and an insertion loss of\n10 dB (including circulator) when the SA was fully saturated,\nwhile the saturation energy of the device was estimated to be\n12 pJ.\nOnce saturated, the SA acts as a linear loss in the system, and\ncannot reduce any amplitude fluctuations or noise accumulated\non \u201cone\u201d bits. In [11], Matsumoto et al. suggested the combi-\nnation of an SA with a highly nonlinear fiber and a bandpass\nfilter, to form a 2R regenerator. Self-phase modulation in the\nfiber results in pulse-compression, and energy equalization is\nachieved by transmitting the pulses through an optical bandpass\nfilter. To complete the 2R regenerator, a 3-km span of TrueWave\nRS fiber ps\/nm\/km was used after the SA, followed by\nan optical filter of 0.9-nm bandwidth.\nThe 2R regenerator was tested in a 10-Gb\/s recirculating\nloop. The experimental configuration is shown in Fig. 2. The\nloop consists of 80 km of SMF ps\/nm\/km , followed\nFig. 3.

The mean power at\nthe input of the 80-km span is set to 1 dBm. The DCM consists\nof dispersion compensating fiber ( 1400 ps\/nm), trimmed\nusing 1.4-km SMF to minimize distortion of a 40-Gb\/s eye after\n15 recirculations around the loop without regeneration. The\ninput power to the DCM was 1 dBm. The 10-Gb\/s input signal\nconsists of 6-ps (full-width at half-maximum) return-to-zero\npulses at 1550 nm, modulated with a pseudorandom binary\nsequence (PRBS) data sequence.\nThe regenerator consists of two sections: The first section\nincorporates an EDFA, a 3-nm bandwidth optical filter and the\nSA, with 16.5-dBm power incident on the SA. The second\nsection incorporates an EDFA that provides 10 dBm at the input\nof the nonlinear fiber, which is followed by the optical bandpass\nfilter.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTo evaluate the performance of the system without the re-\ngenerator, a 3-nm bandwidth optical filter was used before the\nAOM in the loop, to limit the accumulation of out-of-band ASE\nnoise and jitter in the transmission system as the number of re-\ncirculations increases. When the regenerator was added to the\nsystem, the 3-nm bandwidth filter was bypassed, as indicated\nby the dashed arrow in Fig. 2. The evolution of the factor\nwith distance was measured with and without the regenerator in\nthe system. Fig. 3 shows the experimental linear factor with\ndistance without and with regeneration in the system, for mod-\nulation with PRBS and PRBS data sequences.\nThe maximum error-free propagation distance ( factor 6)\nfor a PRBS data sequence without noise suppression\nwas 2000 km. Adding the 2R regenerator in the system, an\nerror-free distance of 7280 km was achieved. The perfor-\nmance of the system was also examined when the input signal\nwas modulated with a PRBS.

Without the 2R regenerator,\nthe factor degrades fast and error-free transmission is only\nachieved over 1600 km. When the regenerator is included in\nthe system, the error-free transmission distance is increased to\nover 5840 km. The faster degradation of the factor in this case,\ncompared to that for the shorter data sequence, is observed both\nwithout and with regeneration, and can be attributed to more in-\ntense jitter. It is interesting to note that for both lengths of PBRS,\nan improvement by a factor of 3.6 in transmission distance\nwas achieved.\nThe electrical eye diagrams of the input signal and after\n2000 km without and with the regenerator in the recirculating\nloop are shown in Fig. 4. At 2000 km, noise accumulation causes\neye closure in the case without regeneration. A clear improve-\nment is observed with the 2R regenerator in the system at similar\ndistances, while the main system limitation as the transmission\ndistance increases to 6480 km is timing jitter.\nIn order to explore the system enhancement through re-\ngeneration, we deliberately increased the loss per span and\nmeasured the factor at a distance of 3440 km. Initially,\nthe optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measured after a single\nspan was 30.5 dB (resolution bandwidth of 0.1 nm for the\nnoise measurement), while the factor after 43 recirculations\nin the loop (3440 km) was 8.55. When the loss per span was\nincreased by 2.8 dB, the optical SNR and factor were re-\nduced to 28.5 dB and 6.2, respectively. The result shows that\nthe interamplifier spacing could be increased to over 90 km\nwhile maintaining error-free transmission.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAn ion-implanted MQW SA integrated in a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot\ncavity was combined with a nonlinear fiber and an optical filter\nto form a 2R regenerator. The 2R regenerator was tested in a\n10-Gb\/s transmission system and an improvement by a factor\n3.5 in the error-free transmission distance was demonstrated\nfor and PRBS modulated signals. The MQW SA\nis polarization insensitive, passive, and requires no postimplant\nfabrication.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. Atkinson, W. H. Loh, V. V. Afanasjev, A. B. Grudinin, A. J. Seeds,\nand D. N.
