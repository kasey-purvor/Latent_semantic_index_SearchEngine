Re-\ncently, hexagonal structures @2#, bright cavity solitons @3,4#,\nand dark cavity solitons @4# were experimentally observed in\nthese devices and a reasonable agreement was found with the\nmodel equations put forward in Ref. @5#. On general grounds,\nit is understood that such spatial structures, whether localized\nor extended, result from modulational instabilities ~MI!\n@6\u20138#. Moreover, as shown numerically in Ref. @9#, the lo-\ncalized solutions and the spatially periodic ones that bifur-\ncate from the MI\u2019s are intimately related. This demonstrates\nthe importance of MI\u2019s when studying the complex spatial\ndynamics of these systems.\nPrevious work revealed that more than one MI can coex-\nist, each associated with different critical wave numbers @10#.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to provide an analytical\nunderstanding of how two such MI can interact in this sys-\ntem. This question has obviously a much broader scope than\nsemiconductor cavities. Previous studies have shown that co-\nexisting pattern-forming instabilities can give rise in two di-\nmensions to quasicrystals @11# or superlattices @12# through\nresonance between unstable modes in nonequilibrium spa-\ntially extended systems. However, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, the kind of interaction reported here has not been ad-\ndressed so far.\nDue to the complicated microscopic structure of the ma-\nterial and because of the diffusion of carriers, only numeric\n@9# or semianalytic @13# theoretical results are available for\nthese devices. Even the characteristic polynomial has to be\nstudied numerically @10#. As a preliminary step in our inves-\ntigation, therefore, we will derive a simpler, more tractable\nequation that retains the relevant spatial dynamics of the\nmodel in Ref. @5#.\nWe thus start from the model in Ref. @5#, although we\nnormalize the variables with respect to the lasing threshold\nvalues ~in the absence of injected field! in order to reduce the\nnumber of free parameters. If we consider a bulk semicon-\nductor cavity driven by a constant electric field amplitude Y1063-651X\/2003\/68~1!\/015201~4!\/$20.00 68 0152at frequency v i , the equations for the dimensionless field F\nand carrier ~real! variable Z are\n]F\n]t\n5iuF1~11ia!ZF2i\u201e2F1Y , ~1!\n]Z\n]t\n5g@P2Z2~112Z !uFu21D\u201e2Z# , ~2!\nwhere time is rescaled to the photon lifetime k21, u5(vc\n2v i)\/k is the normalized cavity detuning, a is the linewidth\nenhancement factor, and \u201e2 is the transverse Laplacian. The\nunit length is the diffraction length v\/A2kv i, v being the\nspeed of light. g51\/(kTn) is the ratio of the nonradiative\ncarrier recombination time to the photon lifetime and D\n5(2kv iTn \/v2)Dn is the rescaled carrier diffusion constant.\nFinally, P is the pump parameter; it is related to the injected\ncurrent I through P5(gNth\/2k)(I\/I th21), where g is the\ndifferential gain and Nth , I th are the lasing threshold values\nof the electron density and the electric current, respectively.\nThey are themselves related to the transparency density N0\nand the volume of the active region V through Nth5N0\n1k\/g , I th5eVNth \/Tn . In what follows, we only consider\npumping currents below the lasing threshold, so that\n2gNth\/2k,P,0. For the sake of simplicity, we have ne-\nglected the radiative recombination of carriers and, without\nloss of generality, Y is real. Finally, we note that if the mul-\ntiple quantum well structure is used, light and matter can\ninteract through a well resolved excitonic line and the corre-\nsponding equations are equivalent to Eqs. ~1! and ~2!. The\nexcitonic detuning is d5(ve2v i)\/ge , where ve is the ex-\ncitonic resonance and ge is the linewidth; d plays essentially\nthe same role as a .\nFor two-level atoms, an analytical treatment based on the\nsmallness of the detunings u and d leads to a Swift-\nHohenberg equation ~SHE! @14,15#. In the present situation,\nd is replaced by a , which is generally of order the of 1, so\nthat the same scheme is not applicable. However, we can\nsimplify Eqs. ~1! and ~2! while retaining the relevant physics\nif we can identify the conditions where ~i! the bistability is\u00a92003 The American Physical Society01-1\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nKOZYREFF, CHAPMAN, AND TLIDI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 015201~R! ~2003!nascent, ~ii! the modulational instabilities that are respon-\nsible for the appearance of spatially structured solutions are\nin a close vicinity of the switching region, and ~iii! the asso-\nciated unstable wave numbers k are small. Moreover, the\nproblem can be explicitly handled if the cavity detuning u\nvanishes. We therefore begin our study with u50. Other-\nwise, the conditions just stated are implicit and the develop-\nment that we will present involve much heavier algebraic\nexpressions.\nFor the homogeneous steady state, one has Y\n5Y (P ,uFu). Nascent bistability corresponds to ]Y \/]uFu\n5]2Y \/]uFu250. This occurs for the critical values Pc\n529\/2, Fc5(12ia)A3\/2(11a2), Zc523\/2, and Y c\n5A27(11a2)\/8. At this operation point, the steady state is\nunstable with respect to homogeneous fluctuations. On the\nother hand, we find from the linear stability analysis that\nthere is a long wavelength instability at this point if\nD.Dc58a\/3~11a2!. ~3!\nWith this piece of information, we are in a position to reduce\nthe laser equations to a single scalar partial differential equa-\ntion by perturbation. We closely follow the procedure ex-\nposed in Ref. @15# for two-level atoms. To formalize the\nrequirement of a small hysteresis domain, we introduce a\nsmall parameter e by\nP5Pc13e2p . ~4!\nSecond, Y is parametrized as Y5Y c(12e2p\/21e3y \/4),\nwhere the second term anticipates a solvability condition at\nO(e2) of the development. Next, from Eq. ~3!, we write D\n5Dc(11ed). It is also necessary to rescale time and space\nas t}e2t and j}e1\/2x. The most suitable scaling in that re-\nspect appears to be t5e2t\/@1\/g1Dc \/a# and j\n5e1\/2x\/ADc. Let us then substitute in Eqs. ~1! and ~2! the\nfollowing power series for F and Z:\nF~x,t !5Fc@11e f ~j,t!1\u0095\u0095\u0095# ,\nZ~x,t !5Zc@11ez~j,t!1\u0095\u0095\u0095# . ~5!\nCollecting like powers of e , we find at dominant order that\nz52 f . It is only at third order in e through a solvability\ncondition that f is determined. We find @16#\n] f\n]t\n5y2 f ~p1 f 2!1~d2 f \/2!\u201e2 f 2a\u201e4 f 2\u201e2 f 2, ~6!\nwhere \u201e2 means now ]2\/]j1\n21]2\/]j2\n2 and a[(1\n2a2)\/(4a2). Let us emphasize that the same can be done\nfor nonzero cavity detuning u , at the cost of increased alge-\nbraic complexity. The reduced equation then retains the same\nform, with the deviation parameters y, p, and d preceded by\nsome u-dependent coefficients. Equation ~6! resembles the\nSHE, which regularly shows up in nonlinear optics @14,17#.\nA notable difference, though, is the occurrence of nonlinear\ndiffusive terms, which are directly imputable to the diffusion\nof charge carriers in the semiconductor material. These qua-\ndratic nonlinearities break the f\u21922 f symmetry that exists01520in the SHE. Other variations of the SHE with nonlinear dif-\nfusive terms have been derived for optical parametric oscil-\nlators @18# and thermal convection @19#, but they preserve\nthis inversion symmetry. The coefficient a in Eq. ~6! must be\npositive, which seems to suggest that Eq. ~6! is valid only for\na,1. In fact, for nonzero u , a can be positive for arbitrarily\nlarge a . To be more concrete, let us consider some typical\nphysical parameters values: Dn530 cm2 s21, Tn51029 s,\nk5531011 s21, v i52.231015 s21, a53. The correspond-\ning reduced diffusion parameter D equals 0.67, and it is\nclose to Dc(u) provided that u.1.66. For this value of u\nand a53, we find that a50.58. In order to check the valid-\nity of the above developments, we have compared bifurca-\ntion diagrams obtained from Eqs. ~1! and ~2! and from Eq.\n~6! and found quantitative agreement with e50.05 in Eq. ~4!\nalthough, for some parameter values, e had to be much\nsmaller @16#.\nWe are now in a good position to study the interaction of\nMI\u2019s. By contrast with the system ~1! and ~2!, the linear\nstability analysis of the homogeneous steady state can be\ndone explicitly and effortlessly with the modified SHE. The\nhomogeneous steady state is given implicitly by y5 f s(p\n1 f s2). Introducing perturbations of the form exp(lt1ik\u0095j)\naround f s in Eq. ~6! yields the dispersion relation\nl52p23 f s22~d25 f s\/2!k22ak4. ~7!\nEquating simultaneously l and ]l\/]k to zero, the thresholds\nfor modulational instability are found to be\nf s5 f 65\n10d64Aa@12d21~25248a !p#\n25248a , ~8!\nwith critical wave numbers k65A(5 f 622d)\/4a , provided\nthat 5 f 6.2d . Two possible situations where both thresholds\nsimultaneously exist are depicted schematically in Fig. 1.\nThe fact that k2\u00dek1 and that f 2\u00de2 f 1 results from the\nnonlinear diffusive terms in Eq. ~6! and could not happen in\nthe usual, symmetric, SHE.\nInspection of Eq. ~8! reveals that, as p approaches p*\n512d2\/(48a225), the two instability points f 6 tend to a\ncommon value f *525p*\/6d , with wave number k*\n5A12f *\/5. In the vicinity of this point, we can describe the\ninteraction between the two instabilities analytically.

Note, in particular,\nthe presence of a complex first-order partial derivative and\nthe way the bifurcation parameters Dp and Dy appear on the\nright hand side. It admits an infinity of branches of spatially\nperiodic solutions of the form A5r exp(iDkh), where r is\nthe oscillation amplitude and Dk is a correction to the critical\nwave number k*.

To each value of Dk corresponds a\nbranch of solution and we thus have a family of curves in the\nbifurcation diagram, as shown in Fig. 2. A crucial observa-\ntion is that the envelope of these branches is itself a branch\nof solutions given by\nlrenv\n2 1mDy252Dp , Dk525Dy \/~48a !. ~13!\nLet us examine how this \u2018\u2018envelope\u2019\u2019 branch evolves in\nthe bifurcation diagram. Here, we only consider the case l\n.0, for which one can show that this branch is stable @16#.\nIf m.0 and Dp,0, it describes an ellipse that connects the\nFIG. 1. Three possible outcomes of the linear stability analysis\nof the homogeneous state of Eq. ~6!. Full line, stable; dotted line,\nunstable. The case p5p* corresponds to f 15 f 2 in ~a! and ~b!,\nleading either to a completely stable homogeneous branch or to ~c!.01520two instability points. This connetion is made possible by the\nfact that the wave number varies along that particular branch.\nOn the other hand, if m,0 and Dp.0, there are two enve-\nlope branches which grow in opposite directions. Finally,\nfrom this situation, changing the sign of Dp leads the two\ninstability points to merge and annihilate in such a way that\nthe envelope solution is nowhere connected to the homoge-\nneous steady state @see Fig. 2#. This proves the existence of\nisolated branches of solutions in the semiconductor cavity. In\nthis situation, no threshold is associated with the instability.\nThese analytical predictions are well reproduced by the nu-\nmerical integration of Eq. ~6! @see Fig. 3#. Periodic boundary\nconditions along the transverse direction have been used and\nthe initial condition was taken to be the upper unstable ho-\nmogeneous steady state plus a small white noise to seed the\ninstability.\nFIG. 2.

On the other hand, hexagonal patterns do appear experi-\nmentally without threshold @2#. This fact was attributed to\ndevice imperfections, which appears perfectly plausible.\nHere, we worked in the limit of nascent bistability and, in\nthis limit, the isolated branch of periodic solution is found at\nhigh field intensities. Therefore, the present analysis cannot\ndirectly be applied to the experiment in Ref. @2#. Neverthe-\nless, it shows that thresholdless appearance of periodic pat-\nterns can have a dynamical origin, in addition to device im-\nperfections. We note in addition that \u2018\u2018collisions\u2019\u2019 of MI\u2019s\ncan, in principle, appear outside the nascent bistability re-\ngime and that the reasoning presented here can be done in\ntwo dimension as well. Numerical simulations carried out in\ntwo dimensions confirm the existence of isolated branch of\nhexagon solutions.\nIn conclusion, we have simplified model ~1! and ~2! into\nEq. ~6! in the nascent bistability limit. Next, we have derived\nthe normal form ~10! for two interacting modulational insta-\nbilities with different critical wave numbers. From the un-01520stable portion of the homogeneous solution emerges a con-\ntinuous family of periodic branches, parametrized by the\nwave number. This family of curves assumes a nontrivial\nenvelope in the bifurcation diagram. It is this envelope that\nshould be considered when determining the transverse spatial\ndynamics of the semiconductor cavity. This envelope can\nsmoothly join the two instability points or form an isolated\nbranch of solutions, in a way that could not be anticipated by\nonly considering a single branch with fixed wave number.\nAfter this paper was submitted, Maggipinto et al. published a\nnumerical study of the dynamical system ~1! and ~2! which\ncompletes and supports much of the above analysis @20#. As\nan extension of this research, it would be interesting to in-\nvestigate if and how envelope branches influence the bifur-\ncation scenarios leading to quasycristals and superlattices in\nother spatially extended nonequilibrium systems.\nIt is a pleasure to thank J.
