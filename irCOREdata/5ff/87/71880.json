They should also address how far political economy \nis (or should become) an interdisciplinary venture. We find it hard to answer these \nquestions, however, because neither co-author identifies with a single discipline. \nIndeed, we reject the discursive and organizational construction (and, worse, the \nfetishization) of disciplinary boundaries. This means in turn that we cannot describe \nour approach as inter- or multi-disciplinary in its aspiration -- even though, faute de \nmieux, we draw on concepts, theoretical arguments, and empirical studies written \nfrom existing disciplinary perspectives. Instead, we describe our shared approach as \npre-disciplinary in its historical inspiration and as post-disciplinary in its current \nintellectual implications. We are not alone in refusing disciplinary boundaries and \ndecrying some of their effects. Indeed, among the most exciting recent intellectual \ndevelopments in the social sciences is the increasing commitment to transcending \nthese boundaries to better understand the complex interconnections within and \nacross the natural and social worlds. Thus our own forum contribution seeks to bring \nout some implications of pre- and post-disciplinary analyses of political economy. We \nadvocate the idea of a 'cultural political economy' and suggest how it might transform \nunderstandings of recent developments in political economy. \n \nExciting Intellectual Developments \n \nWe can classify these into three broad groups. The first is rooted in the gradual \ndecomposition and\/or continuing crisis of orthodox disciplines and is reflected in the \nrise of new transdisciplinary fields of study and a commitment to post-disciplinarity. \nThis is reflected in growing critical interest in the history of the social sciences, their \ngrounding in Enlightenment thought, their links to state formation in Europe and the \nUSA as well as to capitalist economic development, and their differential articulation \nto modernity.2 It is linked to increasing interest in such issues and perspectives as \nthe situatedness of social science knowledge; post-colonialism as topic and method; \nand the challenges to received paradigms from 'post-modernity'. It is also seen in the \ngrowth of 'cultural studies' as one of the most innovative trans- or post-disciplinary \nfields of inquiry and its major role in re-connecting the humanities and social \nsciences; and, more important for our purposes, in the so-called 'cultural turn', \nbroadly understood, in many more orthodox disciplines (see below). Another \nsymptom is the influence of intellectual figures with no clear disciplinary identity \nwhose work is influential across many disciplines. Among these are Louis Althusser, \nJudith Butler, Zygmunt Bauman, Manuel Castells, Michel Foucault, Nancy Fraser, \nAnthony Giddens, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway, David Harvey, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, \nErnesto Laclau, Karl Polanyi, Edward Said, Saskia Sassen, Gayatri Chakravorty \nSpivak, and Iris Marion Young. We can also note new forms of scholarship and the \nentry of new types of scholar into disciplines previously dominated by white, middle-\nclass, malestream theorizing from Europe and North America. Overall, these \ndevelopments have generated multiple challenges to orthodox ontologies, \nepistemologies, and methodologies in individual disciplines.  \n \nThe second set of developments concerns the decline of 'area studies' and the rise \nof various new institutionalisms. Area studies originated in Eurocentric views of other \ncivilizations and in classical imperialist expansionist interests; they grew after the \nSecond World War largely in response to America's postwar security concerns and \nhegemonic pretensions. Comparative politics had already begun to challenge their \nfetishistic division of the world into distinct areas; vulgarized versions of globalization \ntake this further with the idea that we live in one world. In this context variations on \ninstitutionalism (historical, economic, rational choice, sociological, ideational, etc) \noffer different routes to a unified approach to comparative analysis. In addition, the \n(re-)discovery of globalization (previously discussed in terms of the world market, the \ninternational division of labour, cultural imperialism, etc.) challenges the taken-for-\ngrantedness of national societies as units of analysis in most social science \ndisciplines -- including sociology (national societies), politics (national states, public \nadministration, and international relations), neo-classical economics (divided \nbetween micro- and macro-economics, with the latter equated with national \neconomics and\/or international trade), anthropology (concerned with 'primitive \nsocieties'), etc.. All of this has significant implications for political economy -- moving \nit away from traditional understandings of comparative politics and area studies.  \n The third set of developments concerns the emergence of new themes and problems \nthat partly reflect the new approaches identified above, partly reflect real changes in \npolitical economy, and partly reflect new concerns among the sponsors and \nconsumers of 'political economy' as a discipline. Among these themes and problems \nthe most notable are globalization, governance, non-governmental organizations, \nnetworking, the knowledge-driven economy, the primacy of geo-economics over \ngeo-politics, new forms of warfare, new forms of risk, environmental change, bodies \nand embodiment, and temporality and spatiality. We touch on some of these below. \n \nIs the study of political economy an interdisciplinary venture? \n \nOur short, and apparently paradoxical, answer to this question was indicated above. \nWhilst the origins of classical political economy were pre-disciplinary, contemporary \npolitical economy is becoming post-disciplinary. Early students of political economy \nwere polymaths who wrote on economics, politics, civil society, language, morals, \nand philosophy (for example, Locke, Smith, Ferguson, Millar, Montesquieu, Hegel). \nThey examined how wealth was produced and distributed and the close connection \nbetween these processes and modern state formation and inter-state relations. \nLater, political economy was separated into different disciplines: economics; politics, \njurisprudence and public administration; and sociology and\/or anthropology. These \nco-existed with history (typically sub-divided in terms of distinctive historical periods, \nareas, and places and borrowing many concepts from other branches of the \nhumanities and social sciences) and with geography (which had an ambivalent \nidentity and employed eclectic methods due to its position at the interface of nature \nand society and which was often prone to spatial fetishism). We are now witnessing \nthe breakdown of these established disciplinary boundaries as well as the \nrediscovery of space and time as socially constructed, socially constitutive relations \nrather than mere external parameters of disciplinary inquiry. \n \nWhich intellectual traditions are still pertinent to the analysis of the \ncontemporary world? \n \nOur answer is again implied above. The most pertinent intellectual traditions to such \nan analysis are found among those that antedated disciplinary boundaries and\/or \nrefused to accept them. The most obvious of these, by virtue of its historical \ncontinuity and its impact in many disciplines, is Marxism -- although this is best \nconsidered as a family of approaches rather than a single unified system and has \nitself experienced recurrent crises and repeated re-invention. Its overall relevance \nderives from its ambition to provide a totalizing perspective on social relations as a \nwhole in terms of the historically specific conditions of existence, dynamic, and \nrepercussions of the social organization of production. In addition, it originated in a \ncreative synthesis of German philosophy, classical English economics, and French \npolitics and has remained open (in its non-sterilized, undogmatic variants) to other \ninfluences -- witness the impact at different times of psycho-analysis, linguistics, \nstructuralism, post-structuralism, the \u2018cultural turn\u2019, feminism, nationalism, and post-\ncolonialism. Particularly important among Marxist developments in political economy \nin the last 25 years or so are the regulation approach and transnational historical \nmaterialism. The regulation approach is a variant of evolutionary and institutional \neconomics that analyses the economy in its broadest sense as including both \neconomic and extra-economic factors. It interprets the economy an ensemble of \nsocially embedded, socially regularized, and strategically selective institutions, \norganizations, social forces, and actions organized around (or at least involved in) \ncapitalist reproduction.3 Transnational historical materialism is even broader in \nscope.4 It is especially concerned with the international dimensions and \ninterconnections of class formation, state formation, regime building, and social \nmovements and is explicitly trans-disciplinary in approach as well as transnational in \nits substantive concerns.  \n \nAnother important pre-disciplinary intellectual tradition is the so-called Staats- or \nPolizeiwissenschaften (state or 'police' sciences) approach that developed in 19th \ncentury Germany and elsewhere in Europe and has recently been revived in the \nconcern (whether Foucauldian or non-Foucauldian in inspiration) with governance \nand governmentality. Feminism is another recently re-invigorated tradition. It has had \nan increasing impact on questions, methods, and approaches in contemporary \npolitical economy both through its critiques of orthodox approaches, through its \nradical redefinition of the key topics in the field, and through its substantive studies. \n In addition, new intellectual currents have emerged that are becoming increasingly \npertinent to political economy. We will mention just four here. One is political \necology. This seeks to transcend the nature-society dichotomy and to provide a \ntotalizing analysis of their structural coupling and co-constitution. Another is \ndiscourse analysis qua set of methods rather than a distinctive object of inquiry -- \nwith various sub-specialisms (such as the narrative, rhetorical, argumentative, and \nlinguistic turns). Particularly important for our purposes is its focus on the discursive \nconstitution and regularization of both the capitalist economy and the national state \nas imagined entities and on their cultural as well as social embeddedness. Yet \nanother current, less significant as yet in political economy but with obvious import \nfor it, is 'queer theory'. This aims to subvert the heteronormative assumptions of \nfeminism as well as malestream theory and stresses the ambivalence and instability \nof all identities and social entities.5 The fourth current is critical geo-politics and \ncritical security studies. This applies various new intellectual currents to deconstruct \nand redefine the nature of international relations. Palan has recently grouped some \nof these emerging currents together under the rubric of 'post-rationalism' -- a trend \nthat approximate what we ourselves term 'cultural political economy'.6 \n \nWe can counterpose such explicit pre-disciplinary revivals or post-disciplinary \ndevelopments to attempts in some disciplines to establish their intellectual \nhegemony through conceptual and methodological imperialism. The most egregious \nexample here is economics, with its attempt to model all behaviour in terms of the \ncanonical economic man and rational, maximizing calculation. Less influential but \nstill significant is the 'exorbitation of language' in discourse analysis \u00e0 la Laclau and \nMouffe, which analyses all social relations in terms of the metaphor of language. A \nmore productive view is that discourse involves \u2018both what is said and what is done, \nwhich breaks down the distinction between language (discourse in the narrow sense) \nand practice\u2019.7 This enables the analyst to transcend the action\/language distinction \nand to explore the complex 'discursive-material' nature of practices, organizations, \nand institutions. Nor is Marxism immune from its own imperialist tendencies. This is \nespecially serious when it shifts from being one totalizing perspective among others \nto a claim to be able to interpret the world as a closed totality -- a claim aggravated \nwhen expressed in the form of one-sided theoretical deviations such as technological \ndeterminism, economism, class reductionism, politicism, ideologism, or voluntarism. \nIndeed no theoretical perspective is entirely innocent of such tendencies to push its \ntheoretical horizons to the maximum and this can often prove productive within the \ncontinuing development of the social sciences. \n \nIn this spirit we will use our limited space here to support two main arguments. The \nfirst concerns the continued relevance of Marxism as a pre-disciplinary intellectual \ntradition committed to the critique of political economy -- subject to certain \nmodifications consistent with the overall Marxist tradition. The second concerns the \nsignificance of the post-disciplinary \u2018cultural turn\u2019 for rethinking political economy -- \nsubject to certain modifications that re-assert the importance of the materiality of \npolitical economy as regards both its objects of analysis and its methods of inquiry. \nIn our own particular cases, this involves a major convergence between traditional \nMarxism and the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 to produce a Marxist-inflected \u2018cultural political \neconomy\u2019. But there are other ways to reinvigorate Marxism and\/or to develop \n\u2018cultural political economy\u2019 and we do not wish to be too prescriptive. So we will \nmake separate cases for each before offering some overall conclusions. \n \nRe-Invigorating Marxism \n \nMarxism has experienced recurrent crises closely related to capitalism's surprising \ncapacity for self-regeneration and socialism's equally surprising capacity for self-\ndefeat. Yet Marx's pioneering analysis still defines the insurpassable horizon for \ncritical reflection on the political economy of capitalism. This does not mean that it is \nincontrovertibly true and cannot be improved -- far from it. Instead it means that \nMarx's critique of political economy is an obligatory reference point for any serious \nattempt to improve our understanding of the nature and dynamic of capitalism as an \nhistorically specific mode of production.8 This is nowhere clearer today than in \nMarxist analyses of the growth dynamic and crisis-tendencies of Atlantic Fordism, \nthe re-scaling of economic and political relations, the logic -- and illogic -- of neo-\nliberal globalization, the structural contradictions and strategic dilemmas of the so-\ncalled knowledge-driven economy (or, as Castells' influential work defines it, \ninformational capitalism),9 the restructuring of the Keynesian welfare national state \nand the tendential emergence of the Schumpeterian workfare post-national regime,10 \nand the analysis of new forms of socialization of the relations of production \ncorresponding to the new forces of production. Key concepts for this work of re-\ninvigoration include the contradictions inherent in the commodity as the 'cell form' of \ncapitalism; the specificities of labour-power, money, land (or, better, the natural \nenvironment), and knowledge as fictitious commodities; the constitutive \nincompleteness of the capital relation, i.e., the inherent incapacity of capital to \nreproduce itself solely in and through exchange relations; the significance of spatio-\ntemporal fixes as socially-constructed institutional frameworks for displacing and \ndeferring the contradictions and dilemmas of capital accumulation beyond their \nprevailing spatial boundaries and temporal fixes;11 and the overall importance of \nfocusing on social relations, social practices, and emergent processes rather than on \nfixed, unchanging structures and their equally fixed, unchanging contradictions that \nfunction teleologically as the hidden hand of history. \n \nMaking the \u2018Cultural Turn\u2019 in Political Economy \n \nThe 'cultural turn' is best interpreted broadly and pluralistically. It covers approaches \nin terms of discourse, ideology, identity, narrativity, argumentation, rhetoric, \nhistoricity, reflexivity, hermeneutics, interpretation, semiotics, deconstruction, etc.. It \nis important to note here that discourse analysis and its cognates involve a generic \nmethodology as well as the substantive fields of enquiry to which they have largely \nbeen applied. They are therefore as relevant to the investigation of the economic and \npolitical orders as they are to work on the so-called 'ideological' or 'cultural' \nphenomena. One key feature of the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 is its discursive account of power. \nThis involves the claim that the interests at stake in relations of power are \nsignificantly shaped by the discursive constitution of identities, modes of calculation, \nstrategies, and tactics and not just by the so-called 'objective' position of specific \nagents in a given conjuncture (as if they existed outside of discourse); and also that \nthe primary institutional mechanisms in and through which power is exercised, \nwhether directly or indirectly, themselves involve a variable mix of discursive and \nmaterial resources. Another key feature, influenced both by Gramscian and \nFoucauldian analyses, is its emphasis on the social construction of knowledge and \ntruth regimes. Both themes can be applied to political economy itself. Thus \u2018cultural \npolitical economy\u2019 can be said to involve a critical, self-reflexive approach to the \ndefinition and methods of political economy and to the inevitable contextuality and \nhistoricity of its claims to knowledge. It rejects any universalistic, positivist account of \nreality, denies the subject-object duality, allows for the co-constitution of subjects \nand objects, and eschews reductionist approaches to the discipline. However, in \ntaking the \u2018cultural turn\u2019, political economy should continue to emphasize the \nmateriality of social relations and the constraints involved in processes that also \noperate 'behind the backs' of the relevant agents. It can thereby escape the \nsociological imperialism of pure social constructionism and the voluntarist vacuity of \ncertain lines of discourse analysis, which seem to imply that one can will anything \ninto existence in and through an appropriately articulated discourse. \u2018Cultural political \neconomy\u2019 should recognise the emergent extra-discursive features of social relations \nand their impact on capacities for action and transformation. \n \nAn interesting example of the potential for \u2018cultural political economy\u2019 can be found in \nthe recent work of the so-called 'Italian School'12 inspired by Robert Cox's \nappropriation of Gramscian concepts for analyses of international political economy. \nThis school had a strong pluri-disciplinary perspective from the outset -- aiming to \ngive equal analytical weight to production, institutions, and ideas and to develop rich \nhistorical analyses based on a variety of investigative methods. Cox himself \nexamined how modes of production, structures of power, and ideological domination \ncame to be articulated into more or less stable and coherent 'historical structures' or \n'historic blocs' that secure a 'fit' between these three sets of factors. He also argued \nthat each historical structure was contradictory, contested, and liable to eventual \nbreak down.13 He provided a detailed account of the succession of relatively stable \nworld orders under the hegemony (armoured, of course, by coercion) of particular \nnational economies that benefit from their dominance in the most advanced \nproduction technologies and production regimes and that have also solved at least \ntemporarily the problems associated with the preceding world order.14 Thus the \n'great transformation' produced by the hegemonic order of the postwar era emerged \nin response to the social conflict of the nineteenth century. The bourgeoisie \nconsolidated its rule by developing a new hegemonic vision and gradually reshaping \nkey national institutions to help them develop a cohesive culture based on production \nrelations. It generalized its conception of social and political order to the international \nlevel to create an international system supportive of its profit and power interests. \nThis involved creating partners abroad, controlling interest formation by influencing \ntheir domestic environments, and socializing them into the hegemonic worldview. \nNonetheless such attempts to develop transnational hegemony are limited by \ndomestic modes of production and emerging social forces outside the dominant \nsocial formation.15 Recent globalization trends in the world economy reflect a \nfundamental shift from the previously nation(al)-state-oriented mode of production \ntowards a global economy and involve major redesign of the institutional architecture \nof states and international relations.16 \n \nMost earlier Coxian analyses tended to prioritize the (material) power-institution side \nof this trialectic, and therefore, fell short of a more thorough Gramscian analysis in at \nleast three ways: (a) over-privileging class over non-class identities and interests in \nthe analysis of power and institutions; (b) under-examining \u2018ideas\u2019 (even the ideas \ncentral to economic hegemony and governance) -- seeing them in largely ideational \nterms rather than as both practical and discursive in nature, attributing their \nproduction primarily to intellectuals rather than exploring the complex articulation of \nfolklore, popular common sense, specialized disciplines, science, and philosophy, \nand regarding them as relatively fixed rather than as inherently polysemic and \nunstable; and (c) largely ignoring the complex co-constitutive relationship among \nideas, power and institutions in favour of a largely juxtapositional analysis of different \nfactors that were often handled in ideal-typical terms.17 More recent work has begun \nto correct these problems in two ways: first, by adopting a more faithful Gramscian \nanalysis and\/or a taking a Foucauldian cultural turn in dealing with ideational issues; \nand, second, by providing a more rigorous analysis of the institutional mediations \ninvolved in the organization, articulation, and embedding of production and political \ndomination. Thus Cox has recently incorporated \u2018otherness\u2019 into his work on \ncivilizations;18 and has also discussed the new world order in terms of the \u2018new \nmedievalism\u2019 -- \u2018a multi-level system of political authorities with micro- and macro-\nregionalisms and transborder identities interacting in a more complex political \nprocess\u2019.19 Likewise, Gill has examined the \u2018global panopticon\u2019 and surveillance \norder of neo-liberalism;20 Sinclair has investigated bonds and debt-rating agencies \nas producers of financial knowledge;21 and Rupert has discussed the contested \ncommon sense in the USA.22 This shift suggests that Coxians are re-evaluating \nGramsci\u2019s arguments about \u2018ideas\u2019\/culture and have taken the \u2018cultural turn\u2019.  \n Nonetheless, from our paradoxical pre- and post-disciplinary perspective, the Coxian \nSchool has failed to deliver its full potential. In addition to the problems in its initial \nideal-typical analysis of modes of production and structures of domination and its \ntendency to separate the economic and political, it also failed to fully exploit \nGramsci's pioneering analyses. For, if we recall that Gramsci himself saw hegemony \nas moral, intellectual, and political leadership even if it also required a decisive \neconomic nucleus, this would require serious engagement with non-class identities \n(e.g., gender, race, ethnicity) and the distinctive practices involved in constructing \nhegemony on different scales. At stake here is the need to avoid short-circuiting \none's analysis directly to classes as actors and to concentrate instead on how \nidentities, interests, and social movements acquire class relevance and how this \nmight be assessed. In short, the real problem for the early Coxian school is how a \nclass relevant project (e.g., neo-liberalism) is assembled in \u2018material-discursive\u2019 \nspace and how it is reproduced (not mechanistically) within the wider society despite \nits reliance on an inherently unstable equilibrium of compromise and the pressures to \nwhich it is subjected. To this we might add the neglect of the discursive constitution \nof the economy as an object of economic regulation and of the discursive \nconstitution of the political imaginary in and around which particular political regimes \nare stabilised. In both cases this involves not only the demarcation and differential \narticulation of specific institutions (e.g., distributing them across 'economic'-'extra-\neconomic' or 'public'-'private' divides) but also the constitution of specific subject \npositions and their differential articulation with other identities (e.g., workers or \ncitizens with diverse gender, ethnic, 'racial', or regional identities). Building on this \nexample, we now present a research agenda in and for \u2018cultural political economy\u2019. \n \nOn \u2018Cultural Political Economy\u2019 \n \nThe \u2018cultural turn\u2019 in political economy can be translated into at least five interrelated \nresearch injunctions: (a) take the argumentative, narrative, rhetorical, and linguistic \nturns seriously in the analysis of political economy, either as the principal method of \nanalysis or as adjuncts to other methods of inquiry; (b) examine the role of discourse \nin the making and re-making of social relations and its contribution to their emergent \nextra-discursive properties; (c) investigate discourses and discursive configurations \nas a system of meanings and practices that has semiotic structuring effects that \ndiffer from those of emergent political and economic structures and, a fortiori, study \nhow these different principles or logics interact and with what effects; (d) focus on \nthe (in)stability and the interplay of objects-subjects in the remaking of social \nrelations -- and hence the importance of remaking subjectivities as part of the \nstructural transformation and actualization of objects; and (e) examine the \nrelationship between the politics of identity\/difference and political economy - \nespecially the complex articulations between class and non-class identities over \ndifferent times and spaces. Pursuing these themes should enable political economy \nto become more self-reflexive epistemologically and methodologically and to \nbroaden its traditional, structuralist research agenda. \n \nPerhaps the most important role for the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 is to critique the distinction \nbetween the economic and the political on which most work in political economy is \npremised. Some Marxist theorists consider the distinction between the economic and \nthe political as nothing more than an illusory, fetishized reflection of the 'separation-\nin-unity' of the capital relation.23 Although we reject this essentialist position, we do \nshare its insight that the cultural and social construction of boundaries between the \neconomic and political has major implications for the forms and effectiveness of the \narticulation of market forces and state intervention in reproducing and regularizing \ncapitalism. Thus we suggest that, within the totality of economic relations, specific \neconomies be seen as imaginatively narrated systems that are accorded specific \nboundaries, conditions of existence, typical economic agents, tendencies and \ncountertendencies, and a distinctive overall dynamic. Among relevant phenomena \nhere are technoeconomic paradigms, norms of production and consumption, specific \nmodels of development, accumulation strategies, societal paradigms, and the \nbroader organizational and institutional narratives and\/or metanarratives that provide \nthe general context (or 'web of interlocution') in which these make sense.24 \nAccordingly, rather than seek objective criteria to identify the necessary boundaries \nof economic space (on whatever territorial or functional scale), it is more fruitful to \npose this issue in terms of an imaginary constitution (and naturalization) of the \neconomy. This always occurs in and through struggles conducted by specific agents, \ntypically involves the manipulation of power and knowledge, and is liable to \ncontestation and resistance. The state system can likewise be treated as an \nimagined political community with its own specific boundaries, conditions of \nexistence, political subjects, developmental tendencies, sources of legitimacy, and \nstate projects.25 Moreover, building on these arguments, we can also study how \nstruggles over the definition of the boundaries between the economic and the extra-\neconomic (including the political) are central to the economic restructuring and the \ntransformation of the state and state intervention.26  \n \nAnother major theme in \u2018cultural political economy\u2019 concerns the constitution of its \nsubjects and their modes of calculation. This is a field where the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 has its \nmost distinctive contribution to make in rounding out Marxism and critiquing other \napproaches within contemporary political economy. For political economy in general \nhas an impoverished notion of how subjects and subjectivities are formed and how \ndifferent modes of calculation emerge and become institutionalized. Marxism has \nalways had problems in this regard due to its prioritization of class (most egregiously \nso in the unacceptable reductionist claim that there is a natural movement from \nobjective 'class in itself' to subjective 'class for itself').27  But rational choice theories, \nwhich have become increasingly dominant in contemporary political economy, are no \nbetter: they simply naturalize one version of rationality and show no interest in the \nformation of different subjects and modes of calculation. These problems are \nespecially relevant, of course, to the emergence of new subjects and social forces in \npolitical economy -- an issue related closely (but not exclusively) to periods of crisis \nand struggles over how to respond thereto.28 More generally, a \u2018cultural political \neconomy\u2019 approach means that interests cannot be taken as given independently of \nthe discursive constitution of particular subject positions and the modes of \ncalculation from which their interests are calculated in specific material-discursive \nconjunctures.  \n \nBuilding on these two research themes, a third area for \u2018cultural political economy\u2019 \nwould be the analysis of how different subjects, subjectivities, and modes of \ncalculation come to be naturalized and materially implicated in everyday life and, \nperhaps, articulated to form a relatively stable hegemonic order (or, alternatively, are \nmobilized to undermine it). This is an area where Gramsci still has a particular \nrelevance but where his contribution must be reconstructed in sympathetic \nopposition to his over-simplified appropriation in the Italian School. In this way a \n\u2018cultural political economy\u2019 can develop and articulate the micro-foundations of \npolitical economy with its macro-structuring principles in an overall material-\ndiscursive analysis without resorting to the unsatisfactory, eclectic, and incoherent \ncombination of rational choice theory and institutionalism that is still too often \nadvocated as a 'way out' of the impasse of political economy. The key to such a \ncultural political economic analysis would be a reciprocal analytical movement \nbetween the micro through the meso to the macro and back again. Thus one could \nshow the linkages between personal identities and narratives to wider cultural and \ninstitutional formations that provide both 'a web of interlocution'29 and a strategically \nselective institutional materiality.30 One could also demonstrate their connection to \nlarger meta-narratives that reveal links between a wide range of interactions, \norganizations, and institutions or help to make sense of whole epochs;31 and to the \ncomplex spatio-temporal fixes (such as that associated with Atlantic Fordism) that \ninstitutionalize particular spatialities and temporalities as inherent material-discursive \nproperties of individual and organizational routines and that define the spatial and \ntemporal horizons within which action is oriented.32 In short, adopting a \u2018cultural \npolitical economy\u2019 perspective will facilitate research into the conjunction and \ndisjunction of micro-, meso-, and macro-level analyses in both discursive and \nmaterial terms. \n \nTo illustrate these arguments, we briefly consider the rise of neo-liberalism. Even if \none accepted that the framework of a hegemonic order is largely determined by \nmaterial forces, this order must still be narrated and rendered meaningful by and\/or \nto actors located at key sites for its reproduction. For economic agents do not merely \nsubmit to the abstract category of \u2018market\u2019 or the 'dull compulsion of economic \nrelations'. Their economic world is rich in contested meanings regarding what \nconstitutes the \u2018market\/state\u2019, \u2018private\/public\u2019, \u2018competitiveness\u2019 etc., and the rules \nand conventions according to which they should operate. The current neo-liberal \nhegemonic order and its associated symbols (e.g., freedom of choice) and practices \n(e.g., privatization, deregulation, individualism, flexibility, globalization) have become \nmeaningful and partially legitimated in and through particular representational \npractices in diverse sites in production, exchange, and finance. In finance, \u2018market-\nbased monetary rationalities\u2019 and practices are constructed in different domains and \nin a wide range of texts by international institutions such as the IMF, BIS, and credit \nagencies as well as by local(ized) actors, such as bank managers, market analysts, \nand lay investors. A new market-friendly 'common sense' has been constructed in \nand through research reports, official statistical interpretations, speeches, policy \ndocuments, laws, business press, investors\u2019 chronicles, indices, popular economic \nliterature, management courses\/theories, etc. These different discourses may then \nbecome sedimented to form an ensemble of discursive practices that reconfigure \nsubjects and subjectivities, conduct and institutions and generate a new \u2018common \nsense\u2019 that gets selected and repeated as the preferred \u2018reality\u2019 (or regime of truth) in \ndifferent sites. 33  This \u2018reality\u2019 is typically associated with a specific order of spatial \nand temporal horizons of action (e.g., production for the \u2018world market\u2019\/ finance as a \n\u2018space of flows\u2019) and condensed into specific institutional ensembles with distinct \nspatialities and temporalities that differentially reconfigure structural constraints and \nconjunctural opportunities and privilege some strategies and tactics over others. \nFinally, we should note that such discursive practices are always contestable and \nopen to the play of agency (hence also resistance). In the case of neo-liberalism, for \nexample, this is evident in the attempts of (class and non-class) actors to inflect or \ntransform these dominant codes. This occurs through the circulation of alternative \nreports, shadow publications, critical e-mail circulars, independent protest \nmeetings\/slogans, etc., that challenge the dominant \u2018common sense\u2019; as well as in \nmore direct forms of resistance in factories, offices, social movements, and riots. \nThus, a cultural approach reveals the multiple sites\/levels in which class-relevant \nprojects such as \u2018neo-liberalism\u2019 are assembled and contested in material-discursive \nspace; and how its hegemony is reproduced (not mechanistically) despite its reliance \non an inherently unstable equilibrium of compromise and the pressures to which it is \nsubjected.  \n \nIn short, a research agenda based on a cultural approach to political economy \ninvolves addressing the following questions: (a) how are objects of economic \nregulation and governance constituted in specific conjunctures and how do they \nbecome hegemonic despite the inevitable tendencies towards instability and fluidity \nin social relations; (b) how are the actors\/institutions and their modes of calculation \nconstituted and how do they interact to produce these objects in both discursive and \nextra-discursive fields of action; (c) what are the specific discursive practices (e.g., \nhierarchization, exclusion\/inclusion) and structuring principles involved in \nconsolidating the narrative and non-narrative discourses that (re-)position subjects \nand identities, articulate power and knowledge, institutionalize truth regimes, and \nmaterialize power relations in specific institutional contexts; (d) how do counter-\nhegemonic forces challenge routinized categories and naturalized institutions, \ngenerate new subject positions and social forces, and struggle for new projects and \nstrategies; and (e) how are diverse forces continually balanced and counter-\nbalanced in an unstable equilibrium of compromise within specific spatio-temporal \nfixes to maintain what is often little more than a \u2018thin coherence\u2019 in different \nconjunctures?  \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \nOur answers to the three key questions posed to us are as follows. First, the most \nexciting developments in the study of contemporary political economy involve the \nrevival of pre-disciplinary approaches such as Marxism and the rise of post-\ndisciplinary approaches such as \u2018cultural studies\u2019, which, when applied to political \neconomy, opens a space for \u2018cultural political economy\u2019. Second, the study of \npolitical economy became a disciplinary venture in the course of the consolidation of \nthe institutional separation of the market economy, the national state based on the \nrule of law, and the emergence of civil society and the public sphere. The limitations \nof these fetishized distinctions always made the most provocative work in political \neconomy interdisciplinary in the sense of drawing on the best work from different \ndisciplines, especially in concrete-complex analyses. But we are now witnessing the \nemergence of a post-disciplinary approach that reflects the crisis in the received \ncategories of analysis and the disciplines that correspond to them. And, third, the \nintellectual tradition that remains most pertinent to contemporary world is Marxism \ntogether with other species of institutional and evolutionary political economy that \ntake institutions seriously and start from the assumption that the economic and extra-\neconomic are intimately inter-related and co-constitutive. But this tradition can be \nmade even more fruitful through its creative synthesis with other pre- or post-\ndisciplinary traditions such as political ecology and feminism (or queer theory) \nprovided that its primary concern with the materiality of capitalism, its structural \ncontradictions, and its associated strategic dilemmas is maintained. \n \n                                                                                                                                        \nEndnotes \n \n1  The arguments presented below have been jointly developed over many years. \nNgai-Ling Sum introduced the idea of \u2018cultural political economy\u2019 to emphasise the \nimportance of cultural studies for political economy; Bob Jessop reached similar \nconclusions in moving from state theory via the regulation approach to the \nnarrative turn. Whilst Ngai-Ling Sum would describe herself as post-disciplinary, \nBob Jessop prefers to invoke the pre-disciplinary Marxist tradition. \n2   For example, Immanuel Wallerstein, Opening the Social Sciences.
