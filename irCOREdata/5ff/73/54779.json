As Hackley (2003) argues, \nthere is an inbuilt assumption in the majority of texts that marketing can be learnt in \nthe abstract. This approach is evident in many leading texts, typical of the ones used \non undergraduate marketing courses; see for example Jobber (2007), Kotler and \nArmstrong (2006), Brassington and Pettitt (2005); Dibb and Simkin et al (2006). \nNewer texts like Stokes and Lomax (2008) carry on this tradition. The theories \nreferred to here are well rehearsed in the texts. Market segmentation variables exist as \na priori truths. The product life cycle indicates the type of marketing response \nnecessary at each of its stages. There is a normative communications planning model \nwhich emphasises a universal view of consumer behaviour. Marketing plans should \nadopt the same structure everywhere, irrespective of context or size of firm. These \n\u2018articles of faith\u2019 (Kent 1998p139), with their religious overtones, suggestive of a \nchurch of marketing, are informed by a hypothetic deductive approach rooted in a \nsystems perspective. In marketing, it can be argued that a majority of textbook writers \nexist as a priestly type, having a faith in order and regularity. Robson and Rowe \n(1997), note that the current dominant theories of marketing are analogous to a false \nreligion, where belief is required in a totalising system of knowledge.  \n \nThe assumption is that we start from an abstractly generated theory and then move \ninto the real world (Tapp and Hughes 2008). Marketing textbooks conform to this \npositivistic model, where marketing action is seen as either being consistent with a \ntheory or as an aberrant deviation from it. In contrast, practice suggests that marketing \ntheory as espoused in textbooks is rarely found (Edwards 2005). Yet still we continue \nto perpetuate these frameworks as being eminently useful. This paper argues that what \nis out there instead, is a range of disparate practices and marketing activities. The \nlatter first and foremost conform to a local logic of action and not to some abstract \nsystem of marketing thought. In order to examine marketing practice from an \ninterpretative perspective, which attempts to highlight the discrepancies between the \ntheory of textbooks and reality, an inquiry based on a phenomenological approach \nwas adopted. Results are reported that suggest the textbook format currently in use \nneeds a radical rethink, in order to incorporate the ethnography of the marketing \npractitioner. It is not one overarching positivistic theory with attendant models that we \nshould be looking for, but many socially mediated theories.  It seems clear that most \nstandard marketing texts appear to assume that all action is activated through \ntechnical theory (Dunne 1999), when in reality organisations are about a complex, \ninterpreted social world. At the disposal of the interpretative researcher, are a range of \nemic techniques enabling us to better understand the vagaries of the practitioner\u2019s \nworld. These methods, largely underutilised in the study of marketing management, as \nopposed to consumer behaviour, include grounded theory, ethnography, the \nphenomenological interview and ethnomethodology (Goulding 2005; Ehigie and \nEhigie 2005; Hassard 1990). \n 2\nSimon (1994) points out that managers are valuable sources of information, where \nthey are conveyors of an understanding that is rarely exploited in research into \nmarketing. Apart from the selection of often terse case studies in texts by authors, \nthere is little engagement with the narrative form as expressed in the words of actual \nmarketing managers. Short vignettes are put side by side with passages on marketing \ntheory. Rarely do we see marketing practice articulated from the perspective of those \nwho implement it. As a consequence, whether or not marketing principles were \nactually employed becomes very difficult to determine. As Hackley (2003p1342) \npoints out, \u201cMarketing texts offer little ethnographic or other contextual \ninformation\u2026\u201d  Tapp and Hughes  (2008), make the important point that marketing is \nnot amenable to study by an abstract and generalised method. It is a social construct \nalmost impossible to externalise outside of dialogue and debate.  \n \nMarketing management is hence a complex and nebulous phenomenon. Tapp and \nHughes (2008) call for the applied academic to get nearer to this type of knowledge \nthat is trans - disciplinary, reflecting the messy world of the practitioner. The next \nsection outlines the research approach adopted in this study and then considers the \nfindings and how they compare with standard textbook approaches to marketing. \nRelevant academic literature is also examined in this section. Finally, the conclusion \noffers some thoughts on how a revised perspective could be used to enhance and \nchange the present structure of the marketing textbook. \n \nTHE RESEARCH METHOD   \n \nQualitative research can take different approaches Wright (2008). One area is \nphenomenology. The latter   emerged out of a developing discontent with a philosophy \nof science based on an account of measurable material things, which is the approach of \npositivism. Phenomenology takes into account the experiencing person and the \nconnections between human consciousness and objects existing in the natural world. In \nphenomenology, perception is regarded as the primary source of knowledge and is a \nsource that cannot be doubted (Moustakas, 1994). The object of a conscious act or \nexperience is inseparable from the meaning attached to it. Experience is then intentional \nand meaning is at the heart of phenomenological understanding. Phenomenology tries to \nunderstand the way a person lives, creates and relates to the world. The \nphenomenological process describes what is perceived, sensed and known in one\u2019s \nimmediate awareness and experience. What is utilised by the researcher is only the data \nthat is available to consciousness and understanding is developed through the totality of \nthe experience (Moustakas, 1994). The phenomenological approach involves an \nunderstanding of experience in order to obtain a comprehensive description that provides \nthe basis for a reflective structural analysis. This is usually obtained through the open-\nended interview, which is a first person\u2019s report of life experiences (Marshall and \nRossman1999). These life experiences can often be articulated as narratives, further \nadding to the richness of the researcher\u2019s insights (Shankar and Goulding 2001).  \n \nA research study was undertaken then, using the phenomenological interview, which \ninvolved having conversations with senior marketing managers who could speak for \nmarketing activity in their organisation. Over eighty different marketing managers were \nwritten to, using a standard letter, asking for interview access. In the end, twenty four \ninterviews were completed with marketing managers representing a wide range of \nsmall, medium and large sized organisations. A key criteria in selecting organisational \n 3\nmembers to interview, was that respondents had responsibility for writing marketing \nplans. Interviewees  came from printing, building contracting, book publishing, meat \nslicing equipment manufacture, financial services, retailing, computer  hardware and \nsoftware, professional services,  public sector leisure, television, consultancy, and a  \ncharity. Also interviewed were marketing managers from manufacturers of beauty \nproducts, handbags, paint brushes, packaging equipment and small electrical motors. \nFor the purpose of this paper, all respondents and their companies have been made \nanonymous, along with the particular area of the country in which the interviews took \nplace. In all cases, fictitious names have been adopted.  \n \nMARKETING\u2019S ARTICLES OF FAITH: FINDING ALTERNATIVES  \n \nFirstly, it is it is worth noting here that virtually without exception all the managers \ninterviewed were familiar with the technical language of academic marketing, from \nthe four Ps to various strategic planning models. Generally though, these frameworks \nnever really seemed to occupy the thinking of, or form a major part of these marketers \ndiscourse. It can be argued that textbook marketing knowledge is, after all, relatively \neasily acquired, unlike the experientially mediated skills and understanding demanded \nby the complex work practices of the professionals in this study. Brown (1998) has \npointed out that what exists in textbooks is no trivial matter however.  He suggests \nthat it can be argued they represent the very essence of the marketing discipline, a \npoint endorsed by Gummesson (1993; 2002). Kent (1986; 1998), has pointed out that \nmuch of marketing is sacred dogma, a feature sustained by ceremonial incantation. \nArguably the latter is manifested through the marketing textbook. The research here \nsuggests that practising managers have different perceptions of what marketing is, and \ndifferent ways of talking about it, compared to the dictates of the high priests of the \ndiscipline who write these textbooks. As Kent (1986) notes, the first heretics to question \nthe teachings of the church of marketing can be traced back to the early sixties. This \npaper can be seen to fall within this `heretical' tradition and the following sections take \nissue with some of the established \u2018articles of faith\u2019. Hackley (1998), goes some way in \nconfirming this position. He points out that marketing exists in many forms in the life \nworld, where it possesses its own distinctive discursive structures, ones which are \nmarkedly different from ones existing in the textbooks.  \n \nArticle of faith: there is only one definition of marketing \n \nOne such article of faith is represented by the common definition of marketing used. \nIn textbooks, standard definitions of marketing make little or no reference to context, for \nexample the ones by  Kotler and Armstrong (2006) and Brassington and Pettittt (2005).  \nMarketing is defined universally, with little attention paid to the manner in which it \nmight be interpreted by organisational members. A recent attempt by the Chartered \nInstitute of Marketing (2007) to reformulate its definition of the discipline does not move \naway from universalism, despite its length and \u2018verbosity\u2019 (Charles 2007).  Standard \ndefinitions can be seen as potentiality invalidating other marketing meanings and \nactions, which do not conform to the same pre-determined measures. In contrast, for \nmost managers in the study here,  marketing could not be defined in any abstract way \noutside of their own activity frame. A specific organisationally focused definition of \nmarketing, representative of the general findings of this study, is offered by Roy Sands \nof Jenkins department store. When asked how marketing is defined, he commented that, \n \n 4\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, it is promoting Jenkins as a brand to achieve the best \nsales results we can with the resource that we have available and within the sales \npromotional budget.\"   \n \nGeneral findings here indicate that the sense of any object is derived from its context, or \nis `indexed' to a particular situation (Heritage 1984). For organisational actors, it \nbecomes difficult to make sense of what marketing is, if abstracted from its local \ncontext. In considering definitions and their impact on practice, Robson and Rowe \n(1997) point out that a phenomenological study would be of great assistance in assessing \nthe true role of selling in marketing. They postulate that a significant number of \nmarketing academics claim that selling is actually extraneous to marketing activity. As \nBrown (2006p221) has pointed out, marketing is first and foremost about \u2018selling stuff\u2019 a \npoint that sometimes seems to be obscured in marketing textbooks which often attempt \nto make scientific sounding statements about market oriented companies being more \nprofitable than ones with selling orientations.  Judging by some of the comments from \nmanagers in this study, selling is seen as being a very significant aspect of marketing. \nJason Hobart, Marketing Director of Stirling Publisher; \n \n\u201c...marketing is at the end of the day selling, and you sell more by having the right \nproduct at the right price and knowing who the right people are to sell it to.\" \n \nIt can be argued then, that success is not just about basing business activity on a single, \n\u2018right\u2019 way (Murray et al 2002). Robbin's (1991) in-depth case study analysis of a family \ncompany, found that although strategic marketing planning was absent, the company \nwas prospering. Anecdotally, this type of situation is well recognised within the \npractitioner communities. The evidence seems to be strong that academic research in \nmarketing fails to make much of an impression on marketing practitioners. From a \nsurvey of marketing managers McKenzie et al (2002) concluded that none of them \nregularly read an academic journal, and that the awareness of academic marketing \njournals among marketing managers is very low, even for journals that claim to have \npractitioners among their target audience. A recent survey of marketing research \npractitioners established that they find sources of information other than academic \njournals,  mainly  professional magazines and web sites, far more useful for \nprofessional purposes (Baines, et al 2006). It is interesting to note that marketing \ntextbooks are nowhere mentioned in these studies as sources of instruction. \n \nArticle of faith: environments are objectively determined  \n \nAnother central article of faith promulgated in textbooks is based on one which suggests \nthe environment can be represented and analysed in an objective manner. In most \nmarketing texts, there is at least one chapter which represents the environment and its \nconstituent factors in a relatively straightforward and unambiguous fashion. Stokes and \nLomax (2008) is an example. Weick (1995) argues however, that the environment is \nsubjectively perceived and constructed by organisational members as individual acts. \nResearch conducted by Knibbs et al (1987), clearly highlighted how different managers \nwithin the same organisation construct significantly different organisational analyses, \neven though they are all supposedly describing the same external environments. If \nmanagers do not notice, or are not concerned by certain environmental events, then they \nwill not be acted upon (Weick, 1995). For Smircich and Stubbart (1985), strategic \nmanagers are \u201cplaywrights\u201d who create and enact their own environments. \n 5\nWeick also points out that the rational model assumes a mass of data is collected on the \nbusiness environment. This is not always the case in practice. One manager in the study \nspoke for many when he was asked if he completed an environmental analysis. He \nreplied by saying \u201cNo, No\u2026I just want to know how the opposition is disposed \naround me\u2026.\u201d  \n \nIn this study, the business environment was not found to be a fixed objective entity, \nbut embedded in the local rationality of marketing managers worlds. This is a result of \nthe pragmatic acceptance of what is reasonable and achievable, by organisational \nmembers. Textbooks regularly fail to capture this complexity and ambiguity relying \ninstead, on a simple organisation\\environment dichotomy.  \n \nArticle of faith: marketing decisions are best made using rational technical tools \n \nAn additional key article of the textbook faith is represented by the strategic planning \ntools.  In most marketing textbooks, it seems obligatory for firms to carry out a portfolio \nanalysis, see Brassington and Pettitt 2005pp399-404; Kotler and Armstrong pp39-44).  \nThese are ubiquitous in the modern marketing textbook, despite a critical crescendo as to \ntheir relevance. Morrison and Wensley (1991) argue it is an approach which \u2018boxes in\u2019 \nstrategic thinking and is an outmoded orthodoxy. Additionally, the Boston matrix is \ncriticised as being too narrow and difficult to work with. Whilst Brown (2001p93) has \nnoted that the `bloom is going off boxes\u2019 matrices are very resilient. For some of the \nmanagers in this study, it is clear that decisions are based on an alternative, intuitive, \ntacit approach, rather than on the use of boxes.  At Vincent Duke, a major financial \nservices company, the marketing manager indicated that strategic thinking does not \nprimarily come from the planning tools. \n \n \u201c \u2026most of us really do our marketing thinking by just imagining how we would feel as \na customer, and that has given us an awful lot of what we need to know and understand, \nto move the company on.\" \n \nThere is little evidence that marketing textbooks even acknowledge this approach to \ndecision making let alone discuss it. The case is that intuition and tacit knowledge \noften developed in local contexts do not sit well with overarching, explicit rationalist \nframeworks. Robin Cawley, marketing director of the major financial services firm  \nNelson Universals, in wrestling with the inherent problems of trying to model complex \nbusiness activity, indicates the importance of the tacit.  \n  \n\u201cAll you are left with is gut feel and this kind of wisdom and experience. There is a \nplace for that because in the absence of any clear direction you have to base it on \nsomething; you might as well base it on gut feeling as anything else.\" \n \nHackley (2000) in his study of work in an advertising agency, indicated how central tacit \nknowledge is to marketing decision making. Hackley (1999), states the tacit area of \npractical knowledge refers to action which is left out of abstracted theoretical \ndescriptions, but on which the accomplishment of action depends. He contends that high \nlevel practical knowledge in this area is tacit. He goes on to point out that a person who \nis highly accomplished in strategic marketing decision making, is likely to be able to \nutilise sophisticated and experientially mediated concepts in coping with marketing \nissues. These implicit features of marketing knowledge are systematically ignored in \n 6\ntextbooks, where the emphasis is still put on the four Ps of the marketing mix as \nframeworks for understanding (for example Brassington and Pettitt 2005). This is \ndespite concerted argument which suggests the concept is increasingly moribund \n(Gronross 1994; Brownlie and Saren 1992). \n  \nThe notion of social reality as a constellation of pluralities, suggests that knowledge is \noften personal and subjective. A consequence of this is that each marketing manager \nhere has a reservoir of wisdom which is embedded within the context of their own \norganisation. This may not be able to be codified into one overarching marketing reality, \nbut into many. This is a point most textbooks ignore. Trevor Cole of Lewis Stuart, which \nmanufactures small industrial machines, explains why he does not use the analytical \nmarketing tools. Trevor was asked if he used tools like the Boston matrix to help plan \nand execute marketing strategy. \n \n\" No, in practice we probably don't. We use more initiative, conversations. We do with \nthe AVV external overseas distributors...we say, what do you actually think about your \nmarket currently? How do you see it? Forecast what you are going to order from us, and \nin fact we do use their forecast within our manufacturing build programmes.\u201d  \n \nFor Brown (2001), the marketing concept itself is inherently spiritual. It stresses \nbecoming over being, an unending quest for customer orientation and the pursuit of \ngeneral theories. This priestly view of marketing has its attendant rites and rituals, part of \nwhich is its analytical tools. As Kent (1998p139) points out, current marketing \nknowledge is \u2026.\"Embedded in faith - faith in the efficacy of its preaching; faith in the \ncatechisms of its teachings; faith in the textbooks of marketing dogma.\u201d Matrices are \ninherently mystical squares and boxes; they are chimera, articles of faith that appear in \ntextbooks, but not in the life worlds of the marketing managers in this study. \n \nArticle of faith: marketing is mainly about managing the four Ps \n \nMany textbooks give the strong impression that marketing is principally about managing \nthe four Ps, see for example Stokes and Lomax (2008). In Dibb et al (2006), pages 293 \nthrough to 713 deal almost exclusively with the manipulation of the marketing mix. In \ncontrast, managers in the study often referred to the inadequacy of a four Ps approach. \nAt Stirling Publisher, Jason Hobart, the marketing director, points out that,  \n \n\u201cin the marketing plan you will not see the four Ps\u2026it becomes a  bit slavish\u2026.I \nwould rather talk about understanding markets, understanding how you reach end \nusers, and understanding how you continue your business as usual; sales to those \nmarkets, how you get incremental sales to those markets, how you get loyalty, so \nduring the year we have got a growing loyal base.\u201d  \n \nIt can probably be argued that in fact marketing is more about the management of \nrelationships. Gummesson (2002) is critical of the way relationships and networks are \ndealt with in marketing textbooks. He argues that the area has still not made any \nsubstantial impact, with relationship marketing often appearing as an adjunct chapter at \nthe end.  This may be overstating the case. None of the following have a whole chapter \ndevoted to relationship marketing; Brassington and Pettitt (2005), Dibb and Simkin et al \n(2006), Jobber (2007), Stokes and Lomax (2008). Given Gummesson\u2019s point that \nbusiness is a primarily a network of relationships, the reductionist logic inherent in the \n 7\nmarketing textbook is flawed. For Gilmore et al. (2001), networks are an important \nway in which marketing decisions are made. Their study indicates that SME \nmarketing decision making is built around spontaneity, reactivity, informality and \nlooseness.  As a result of the interviews carried out with the managers of this study, \nthere is no reason to suggest that networks are not a major way in which marketing \ndecisions are made in all types of businesses, not just small ones. \n \nThe case is that the conventional strategic planning models of the textbooks emphasise a \nsimple systemic approach. This largely ignores context as Hills et al (2008) study shows. \nThey identify small business `entrepreneurial\u2019 marketers, where business is principally \nabout a social, negotiated order rather than the simple systemic truths of marketing \ntextbooks. As Brown (2008) notes, structure dominates agency in most mainstream \nmarketing books. The latter do not capture the complex nature of lived reality and the \nstrategy-making process which exists within the network approach to marketing \n(Wensley 1995; Moller and Halinen 2000). Here, the emphasis is not on general \nprescription but, rather, on description and understanding, in an attempt to explain how \ninstitutions and individuals interact in inter-firm relationships (Ellis and Meyer, 2001). \nAt Mitre Technics, which is a B2B firm,  it is almost impossible just to base \nmarketing on a simple general planning model, as each customer has to be dealt with \nindividually. Gordon Willis indicates that, \n \n\"...everything is sold to a different specification to every customer...a lot of long term \ncontracts and you have to write very detailed customer plans and  quality plans for a \ncontract...we are currently writing contracts now, that will  run for another eight or \nten years...\u201d \n \nArguably, a key relationship within the organisation is the internal market.   Although \nthe debate about this area  has been present for some considerable time (see (Ahmed \nand Rafiq 2004; Piercy and Morgan 1994), it has still not yet appeared as a mainstream \ntopic in marketing textbooks, As Robin Cawley, marketing director   comments,   \n \n\u201c\u2026your own people, who at the end of the day are the make or break of your \ncompany, because that is who the customer and the retailer will touch\u2026.and if they \ndon\u2019t agree with what the company is doing? ...internal marketing is incredibly \nimportant, that is counted as almost the thing that most marketing textbooks ignore.\u201d \n \nAs with relationship marketing generally, none of the textbooks examined gave it a \nseparate chapter. The failure to deal with this topic fully, with its emphasis on people, \ntheir often diverse perceptions and motivations at work, means that textbook marketing \nisolates itself from the interdisciplinary nature of   practice. Somehow, magically, \nemployees fit unproblematically into the configurations of the organisations marketing \nsystem. This is an assumption strongly questioned in this study, supported in turn by the \nwork of Harris and Ogbonna (1999). \n \nArticle of faith: True marketing understanding is about the principles of analysis, \nplanning and control \n \nAnother area of significant neglect in the study of marketing decision making in \ntextbooks, which is linked to relationship and network activity, is the role of talk. \nMarketing textbooks overwhelmingly see the discipline in terms of a straightforward \n 8\nfunctionalist model, devoid of subjectivity.  As Brownlie and Saren (1997p150) note, \nmarketing is reported in such as way so as to neglect \u201cthe broader social processes \nand practices that are constitutive of organising activity.\u201d Despite the fact that as early \nas 1973, when Mintzberg showed that management decision making is characterised \nby  verbal interaction, the study of talk still does not occupy the writers of marketing \ntextbooks. As Boden (1994) points out, the main activity of managers in organisations \nis not planning, but talking.  In the study here, talk was found to be a central aspect of \nmarketing decision making. Vaara et al., (2004) note that much existing research into \nstrategy ignores the discursive practices of individuals. King (2003), points out that in \norganisational theory, the role of text is dominant over that of talking. Hackley \n(2003), indicates that the enacted complexities of marketing are reduced to the endless \nreproduction of abstract principles in texts where the process of talk is ignored. Des \nArkwright, director of leisure marketing at Newfound City Council, indicates that talk \nis intrinsic to his work. \n \n\u201c\u2026So an awful lot of talking internally, with various people and an awful lot with \npartners, potential partners and again I mean last week we had a company come down \nfrom  Scotland who would like to build facilities, maybe in some of our parks, and \nthere was a lot  of talking to them...quite a bit of talking to communities...\" \n \nExplicit theories of marketing contained in textbooks, dealing with high level strategic \ndevelopment fail to engage with the notion of the socially mediated nature of \nknowledge. Decision making is linear, variables can be easily isolated and technical \nrationality dominates the process of understanding (Cunningham 1999). In contrast, for \nWeick (1995), the sense that managers make of their world is not rooted in theoretical \nmodels, but in reflexivity and the ongoing nature of events, where managers are always \nin the middle of things. Strategy becomes observed patterns in past decision behaviour \nand is not a future constructed now, and then subsequently implemented as the analysis, \nplanning and control model suggests. Guy Martin of Media K a marketing and design \nconsultancy goes on to suggest there is a key element of retrospect to decision making.  \n \n\u201cIf  you are wandering along with your army, fighting your battles and all that, at \nsome point you have got to go over the next hill and see what is there and look back \nand see how you are.\" \n \nSignificantly, what textbooks actually fail to do adequately is to capture the narratives \nthrough which marketers make sense of their world. An important body of research in \norganisations has been carried out, showing the extent of storytelling in organisations \n(see Boland and Tenkasi 1995; Hopkinson 2003; Skoldberg 1994). The textbooks \nemphasise normative marketing theory where people appear devoid of their \ninterpretative, narrative based selves.  As Patterson and Brown (2005) point out, telling \ntales is central to successful communication. The problem is that marketing academics \nseem to have forgotten this important fact when they come to write their textbooks. This \nstudy found that managers frequently resorted to stories when recounting their \nexperiences. If managers think in story telling modes they why is this not reflected in \ntexts?  One of the managers in the study commented on how people go about making \nmeaning in their organisation, using stories \n \n\u201cPeople think narratively, we do not think in bullet points\u2026what bullet points lack are \nthe broader explanations which people need\u2026in terms of my staff having to \n 9\nimplement plans, people will say \u2018I worked for so and so and this is how we did it, \ncan we do something like that here\u2019. People rarely say we must achieve this or that \nratio or percentage rate, but people will tell each other stories about retention rates \ninstead.\u201d \n \nMarketing is essentially about good communications and here there is a paradox if we \nthink about the role of the textbook. Brands are built on good stories (Brown 2005). \nAre textbooks however, helping to develop the marketing storytellers of the future?  \nThe reliance in the textbooks on largely untested articles of faith, generalised, \nunimaginative theories, and a variety of mystic matrices  (Brown 2001), is unlikely to \nprovide budding marketers with the facility to provide the consumer with an inspiring \nvision of a company\u2019s products and services. Textbooks not only fail to reflect reality, \nbut they are also doing a disservice to those about to enter the field. As Brown (2008) \nshows, many leading marketing practitioners have never formally studied the topic \nand yet are successful, despite having little familiarity with 4Ps, 7Ss or 3Cs.  As yet, \nfew newer marketing textbooks, with some exceptions, (see Blythe 2006; Saren 2006; \nPalmer 2004), appear to be about attempts to pursue different agendas. The latter \nbook for example, places relationships in much more of a pivotal position than many \nother established texts, while the first takes a critical perspective on some established \naspects of  prescriptive theory, through the use of \u2018talking points\u2019 throughout the text. \nSaren\u2019s book represents a radical departure with an emphasis on marketing as a social \nprocess, rather than as a set of instrumental management driven processes.  In general \nthough, it is clear that most marketing textbooks remain remarkably resilient to \nchange.  \n \nCONCLUSION: THE ENDING OF HERESY AND THE CREATION OF   A \nNEW VISION OF MARKETING \n \nIn drawing together the findings from the research, a number of key issues emerge.  \nFirstly, marketing was never defined as an abstract principle outside the activity frame \nof these managers. The study reflects the point made by Hackley (2001p94) that \u201c\u2026I \nhave never heard of a marketing intervention that was that was designed and enacted \nguided by anything other than local experience\u2026\u201d Another key finding relates to \nselling. The latter is frequently relegated to a position of lesser importance in general \nmarketing textbooks. In this study, it is seen by managers to be a central feature of \ntheir activity. Additionally, the business environment, which is usually subjected to a \nsuperfluity of analytical models, is not imbedded in these frameworks, but exists \ninstead in the enacted complexities of managers\u2019 day to day sensemaking experiences. \nFor the marketers of this study, decision making boxes are often viewed as being \nperipheral, with judgements about marketing being based around the tacit and the \nintuitive. Allied to this, the basis for a considerable amount of decision making in \nmarketing is relationships and networks, where strategy emerges from talk, interaction \nand the general flow of discontinuous events. Decisions come from observing patterns \nin past behaviour and acting on these patterns in a reflective, indexical manner. \nInternal relationships are also very significant. Marketing success is not based on a \nsimple grasp of planning principles and processes, but on an understanding of how \npeople as subjective actors work and think in the pursuit of  often diverse personal \nobjectives. The commitment of employees and their ability to be able to derive a \nsense of meaning from work is as central to the success of marketing as any rational \ndecision tool. Finally, it is important to note that marketing success is perhaps \n 10\npredicated on no more than a good story told well, a point missed by most of the \nstandard marketing texts, with their emphasis on rational processes. \n \nReality is multifaceted and arguably, each marketing situation is unique. How can the \nrichness of this marketing practice be better understood and communicated? It is \nargued that to understand this complexity, means that marketing scholars should first \nexamine what goes on under the name of marketing in organisations, using an \ninterpretative perspective.  The resulting thick descriptions could be the basis of new \nvisions and theories of marketing which are rooted in the lived world of the \npractitioner and not in abstract theory. Some important implications stem then from \nexamining the local contexts in which marketing operates. This study shows for \nexample, that the marketing manager of Vincent Duke operates relatively successfully \na marketing process that does not bear much resemblance to the dominant model. \nWhy then can\u2019t the marketing textbook capture, in rich ethnographic detail, the \nexactitudes of the decision making process he uses and the ensuing practical action? \nInstead, we have emasculated case studies that demonstrate dubious notions of terse \npropositional knowledge, which always are linear and technically rational. In marked \ncontrast, the business world is fraught with problems and fails to conform to textbook \nprinciples. Kent (1998) calls for the observation of reality to be mediated through a \nfocus on the subjective worlds of participants. The multiple realities of marketing \ncannot be brought to light using only the rituals and rhetoric used by the priests of \nmarketing\u2019s established church. What is required is a different vision of marketing \nreality. Diversity should be embraced, seen as adding to knowledge, rather than being \ndismissed as simple heresy.  \n \nManagers in this study have provided some insights into their own personal views of \nmarketing theory and practice and these could be further assembled and extended to \nprovide marketing learners with deep contextual information about the management \nof marketing. As individuals in society we interpret and order our knowledge in \ndifferent ways (Berger and Luckman 1966), so it is questionable to think that \nmarketing knowledge should be represented any differently. The search for and belief \nin a general theory of marketing is illusory, when confronted by the reality of \nmarketing managers local experiences and knowledge. Textbooks must try to capture \nthis aspect of reality, if they are to present marketing with integrity. The argument \nwhich states the role of textbooks is present sets of handy mnemonics to learners is a \ntired one. The discipline has to draw much more fully on the interpretative tradition. \nWe are likely as a consequence, to end up with competing theories of what marketing \nis, based on accounts of practice. This can only add value to the subject both as an \nacademic endeavour and as an applied field. If this complicates marketing, making it \nmore interdisciplinary and demanding for learners, then this is a challenge worth \nfacing. Ass a result, a new ethnographically informed marketing will be based on the \nchanging common sense practices of social actors and not within a set of reified and \ndubious articles of faith.  \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAhmed, P.
