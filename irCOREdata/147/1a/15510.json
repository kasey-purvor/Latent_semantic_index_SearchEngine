Eikemo\nThis article uses data from three waves of the European Social Survey\n(2002, 2004, 2006) to compare educational inequalities in self-reported health\n(good vs. bad) and limiting longstanding illness in six age groups based on\ndecade of birth (1930s\u20131980s) in 17 countries, categorized into four welfare\nstate regimes (Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Scandinavian, Southern). The\nauthors hypothesized that health inequalities in these age groups would\nvary because of their different welfare state experiences\u2014welfare state\nregime life courses\u2014both temporally, in terms of different phases of welfare\nstate development (inequalities smaller among older people), and spatially,\nin terms of welfare state regime type (inequalities smaller among older\nScandinavians). The findings are that inequalities in health tended to increase,\nnot decrease, with age. Similarly, inequalities in health were not smallest in\nthe Scandinavian regime or among the older Scandinavian cohorts. In keeping\nwith the rest of the literature, the Bismarckian and Southern regimes had\nsmaller educational inequalities in health. Longitudinal analysis that\nintegrates wider public health factors or makes smaller comparisons may be a\nmore productive way of analyzing cross-national variations in health\ninequalities and their relationship to welfare state life courses.\nRecently, there has been a surge in comparative social epidemiology and public\nhealth policy research, and a sizeable amount of this has examined the relationship\namong different types of welfare states (welfare state regimes) and population\nInternational Journal of Health Services, Volume 40, Number 3, Pages 399\u2013420, 2010\n\u00a9 2010, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.\ndoi: 10.2190\/HS.40.3.b\nhttp:\/\/baywood.com\n399\nhealth (1). Initially, attention was placed on differences by welfare state regime\nin terms of overall population health (e.g., infant mortality rates, life expectancy\nat birth, or self-reported health) (2\u20136). These studies consistently found that\npopulation health is enhanced by the Scandinavian welfare state regime, which\noffers universalism, comparatively generous replacement rates, and extensive\nwelfare services (7). For example, Navarro and colleagues (4) found that countries\nthat have had long periods of government by redistributive political parties (most\nnotably the Scandinavian countries) have experienced lower infant mortality\nrates. These findings were reinforced by Chung and Muntaner\u2019s multilevel longi-\ntudinal analysis of welfare state regimes (8), which showed that about 20 percent\nof the difference in infant mortality rates among countries, and 10 percent of\nthe difference in low birth weight, could be explained by the type of welfare\nstate, with the Scandinavian welfare states outperforming the others. Similarly, a\nmultilevel study of morbidity by welfare state regime found that the Scandinavian\nwelfare states fared better, with lower rates of limiting longstanding illness and\npoor self-reported health (6).\nMore recently, and especially since publication of the results of the Tackling\nHealth Inequalities in Europe project (www.eurothine.org), empirical attention\nhas shifted to examining differences by welfare state regime in terms of socio-\neconomic inequalities in health (9\u201314). There was a clear expectation, not least\nbecause of their comparatively strong performance in terms of overall population\nhealth, that market-generated health inequalities would be smaller in the more\ngenerous and egalitarian Scandinavian welfare states. However, with the excep-\ntion of one study (9), recent comparative research on health inequalities by\nwelfare state regime has found that inequalities in self-reported health are smallest\nin the Bismarckian welfare states, not the Scandinavian ones (11, 12, 14). Simi-\nlarly, for mortality, no evidence of systematically smaller inequalities was found\nin the Scandinavian welfare states\u2014indeed, the inequalities were smallest in\nthe Southern regime countries (10). This has been a contentious finding, given\nthe egalitarian ethos and redistributive policies of the Scandinavian countries\n(especially when contrasted to the status-maintaining approach of the Bismarckian\nwelfare states) (7). Subsequently, there has been much debate on this topic, and\nvarious explanations have been put forward for the counterintuitive findings,\nranging from artifact (15), to health behaviors (10), to relative deprivation\n(16, 17) (for an overview, see 18). These explanations, however, are rather\nunconvincing, and one possible issue that may have explanatory power, or at\nleast contextual relevance, is whether the findings are consistent in terms of\nage-related welfare state experience\u2014what we refer to in this article as welfare\nstate regime life course. This is important not just in terms of establishing\nwhether the earlier findings are consistent when examined by age group, but\nalso because it provides a possible way of gaining insight into how patterns of\nhealth inequalities across Europe are related to the development of welfare states\nand welfare state regimes.\n400 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nWelfare states are by no means static entities; in fact, they have experienced\nnumerous changes since their initial establishment in the early postwar period\n(19). In the social policy literature it is possible to identify at least four phases\nin the development of the majority of postwar Western welfare states: first,\npre-welfare state; second, the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the Fordist welfare state; third,\ncrisis and restructuring; and fourth, the emergence of post-Fordist workfare\nstates (20). Welfare state experiences will therefore differ by people\u2019s age, both\nwithin and between countries. For example, the welfare state experienced by\nolder people in the Scandinavian countries will differ considerably from that\nexperienced by younger people in the Anglo-Saxon countries.\nSimilarly, following life course epidemiology, health status reflects not just\nan individual\u2019s current position but also his or her accumulation of (welfare\nstate) experiences over time (21). The life course perspective highlights the\nimportance of critical periods and pathways of causation that allow us to under-\nstand the effect of the lived experience of different welfare state regimes on\nhealth inequalities (22). Yet, even though an understanding of the differential\nimpact by socioeconomic status of welfare state regimes on life course trajectories\ncan illuminate the role of public policies, there is a paucity of studies that use\nlife course perspectives on welfare state regimes and health inequalities. This\nis due, to some extent, to a lack of suitable data. A way out of this impasse is\nprovided by the fact that life course in Western societies is partly age-structured\n(23). To a certain extent, the life course is thus (age) standardized by common\nwelfare state institutions (24). For certain aspects of the life course, such as\neducation, this age structuring is more substantial than for others. Examining\nhealth inequalities by age group therefore enables us to consider the effects of\nwelfare state regime life courses: it provides an opportunity to look at patterns of\nhealth inequalities within the development of European welfare states.\nWELFARE STATE REGIMES\nIn his seminal work The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Esping-Andersen\npresented a three-fold classification of Western welfare states (liberal, conserva-\ntive, social democratic) (7). His typology was based on the operationalization of\nthree principles: decommodification (the extent to which an individual\u2019s welfare\nis reliant on the market), social stratification (the role of welfare states in main-\ntaining or breaking down social stratification), and the private-public mix (the\nrelative roles of the state, the family, and the market in welfare provision). There\nhave been numerous critiques of the Three Worlds typology: in terms of the\nrange of countries and regimes, the absence of a consideration of gender, the\nmethodology, and\/or the focus on cash benefits (for an overview, see 1). As a\nresult of this criticism, modified or alternative typologies have been proposed,\nmost of which place emphasis on those characteristics of welfare states not\nextensively examined by Esping-Andersen and which tweak the number of\nregimes and\/or specific country classifications (25). Although none of these\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 401\nalternative categorizations has been generally accepted as the new standard\ntypology of welfare regimes, Ferrera\u2019s typology (26) has been highlighted as\none of the most empirically accurate. The Ferrera typology classifies countries\non the basis of service coverage, poverty rates, and income replacement rates. It\nresults in a fourfold typology of European welfare state regimes: Scandinavian\n(social democratic), Anglo-Saxon (liberal), Bismarckian (conservative), and\nSouthern (see Box 1). In this article, as with our previous research on welfare\nstate regimes and health outcomes (6, 12\u201314, 27), we use the Ferrera typology.\n402 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nBOX 1\nWELFARE STATE REGIMES\nScandinavian. The Scandinavian regime type (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden)\nis characterized by universalism, comparatively generous social transfers, a\ncommitment to full employment and income protection, and a strongly inter-\nventionist state. The state is used to promote social equality through a redis-\ntributive social security system. Unlike the other welfare state regimes, the\nScandinavian regime type promotes an equality of the highest standards, not an\nequality of minimal needs, and it provides highly decommodifying programs.\nAnglo-Saxon. In the welfare states of the Anglo-Saxon regime (United Kingdom,\nIreland), state provision of welfare is minimal, social transfers are modest and\noften attract strict entitlement criteria, and recipients are usually means-tested\nand stigmatized. In this model, the dominance of the market is encouraged\nboth passively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, and actively, by subsidizing\nprivate welfare schemes. The Anglo-Saxon welfare state regime thereby\nminimizes the decommodification effects of the welfare state, and a stark\ndivision exists between those\u2014largely the poor\u2014who rely on state aid and\nthose who are able to afford private provision.\nBismarckian. The Bismarckian welfare state regime (Austria, Belgium, France,\nGermany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland) is distinguished by its\n\u201cstatus differentiating\u201d welfare programs, in which benefits are often earnings-\nrelated, administered through the employer, and geared toward maintain-\ning existing social patterns. The role of the family and the voluntary sector\n(especially the Church) is also emphasized, and the redistributive impact is\nminimal. However, the role of the market is marginalized.\nSouthern. In Ferrera\u2019s typology, the Southern European welfare states (Italy,\nGreece, Portugal, and Spain) comprise a distinctive, southern, welfare state\nregime. The southern welfare states are described as \u201crudimentary\u201d because\nthey are characterized by their fragmented system of welfare provision, which\nconsists of diverse income maintenance schemes that range from the meager\nto the generous, and welfare services, particularly the health care system, that\nprovide only limited and partial coverage. Reliance on the family and voluntary\nsector is also a prominent feature.\nSource: Adapted from Eikemo and Bambra (29).\nWELFARE STATE REGIME DEVELOPMENT\nThe historical development of postwar welfare provision across Western Europe,\nas noted above, can be divided into four distinctive periods: pre\u2013welfare state,\nthe golden age of the welfare state, crisis and restructuring, and the emergence\nof post-Fordist workfare states. To some extent, the timing of these periods\nof welfare state development varies by country and by welfare state regime.\nFor example, the Southern regime countries (except Italy) experienced dic-\ntatorships until the mid-1970s, with highly regressive fiscal policies (4); nor is\nthe timing of developments universal in other regimes\u2014for example, Finland\u2019s\nwelfare state developed later than that of the other Scandinavian countries. This\nhistorical overview is therefore only able to capture the broad thematic changes\nin the development of European welfare states.\nPre\u2013Welfare State\nFor most of the 19th century, there was minimal state welfare within Europe\nbeyond very basic \u201cpoor relief\u201d\u2014the provision of basic food rations and\nshelter (often provided through institutions such as the English workhouse\nsystem). Beyond these provisions, welfare came from family members or\ncharity (particularly the Church). This began to change in the early 20th\ncentury with the introduction of rudimentary, highly selective (non-workers,\nwhich included most women, were typically excluded), state-organized welfare\nsystems, which provided basic pensions, unemployment benefits, and sick-\nness benefits funded through social insurance payments (e.g., the 1911 National\nInsurance Act in the United Kingdom and the Bismarckian welfare reforms of\n1880s Germany).\nGolden Age of Welfare\nIt was not until after World War II (1945) that what is now referred to as\nthe Fordist welfare state was established. There are competing explanations as\nto why the welfare state emerged at this point, between modernization theory,\nthe power resources model, and the requirements of capital thesis (for a detailed\noverview, see 20). To a greater or lesser extent (see Box 1), the golden age\u2019s\nFordist welfare state was characterized by centralism, universalism, Keynesian\ndemand-management, full (male) employment and high public expenditure, and\nthe promotion of mass consumption through a redistributive welfare system\nand social wage (28). There was also a mainstream political consensus in favor\nof the welfare state. In the golden age of welfare state expansion (1940s to\n1960s), Western Europe experienced significant improvements in public housing,\nhealth care, and the other main social determinants of health (29).\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 403\nCrisis and Restructuring\nThe golden age of welfare state expansion effectively ended with the economic\ncrisis of the 1970s (high inflation, slow economic growth, the end of full employ-\nment), during which there was a general loss of confidence in the ability of\nFordist welfare state capitalism to adequately maintain profitability and safe-\nguard capitalist reproduction (initially in the United Kingdom and then across\ncontinental Europe). Besides these internal constraints, there were also external\nchallenges such as globalization (30). The political consensus of the early postwar\nyears was also broken, and governments started to dismantle and restructure\nthe welfare state. Reforms (which largely occurred in the 1980s and 1990s)\nwere characterized by the privatization and marketization of welfare services,\nentitlement restrictions and increased qualifying conditions for benefits, and a\nshift toward targeting and means-testing; cuts or limited increases in the actual\ncash values of benefits; modified funding arrangements (with a shift away from\nbusiness taxation); and an increased emphasis on an active rather than a passive\nwelfare system (29).\nPost-Fordist Workfare States\nThe restructuring of the welfare state has been analyzed by some commentators\nas a shift from the Fordist system of Keynesian welfare state capitalism, which\ncould afford and required a high level of public welfare expenditure, to a\npost-Fordist system of Schumpeterian workfare state capitalism in which high\nwelfare expenditure is incompatible with the continuing needs of capital accumu-\nlation (20). Post-Fordist workfare states are characterized by decentralization\nand welfare pluralism, the promotion of labor market flexibility, supply-side\neconomics, the subordination of social policy to the demands of the market,\nand a desire to minimize social expenditure (20, 28). As in the Fordist welfare\nstates, there are variants on the post-Fordist model reflecting welfare state regimes\nand their differing policy responses to common challenges (28, 31).\nRESEARCH HYPOTHESES\nDuring these different phases of development, the welfare states of Europe\nhave acted as greater (during the golden age) or lesser (during the pre\u2013welfare\nstate and post-Fordist periods) mediators of the impact of social determinants\non health and health inequalities. We therefore suggest that educational inequal-\nities in self-reported health will vary by welfare state experience (welfare state\nlife course) both temporally, in terms of the different phases of welfare state\ndevelopment, and spatially, in terms of welfare state regime type. Specifically,\nwe examine two interrelated hypotheses:\n404 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\n1. Patterns of educational inequalities in health will vary by age within welfare\nstate regimes, being smaller among older people.\n2. Patterns of educational inequalities in health will vary by age among\nwelfare state regimes, being smallest among the older Scandinavian\ncohorts.\nMETHODS\nThe data are from the European Social Survey (ESS), from which we used the\nmerged version of three waves (2002, 2004, and 2006) for 17 Western European\ncountries. Data and extensive documentation from the ESS are freely available\nfor downloading at the Norwegian Social Science Data Services website\n(www.nsd.uib.no). We included 85,514 individuals divided into six age groups\n(people born in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, representing\ndifferent welfare state life courses; see Table 1), after listwise deletion of cases\nfrom all applied variables.

It avoids interpretation problems, because it is less volatile\nthan income and occupation (which are more influenced by health-related\nsocial mobility later in life) and social mobility. The association between socio-\neconomic position and poor health is well established, and education has\nadditional specific influences through increasing knowledge and skills that may\naffect cognitive function, make individuals more receptive to health education\nmessages, and\/or make them more able to communicate with and access health\nservices (32). In meritocratic societies, education is a fundamental indicator\nof people\u2019s position in society, because it is an important contributor to later\noccupation and income (33, 34).\nThe measure of education was based on a variable describing full-time\neducation in years. However, as Table 2 shows, average years of education\nvaries among European countries and is especially low in the Southern\ncountries. In comparative studies, it is thus important to take into account\nthe extent of variation of reported years of education in different countries.\nWe did this by applying a total impact measure of education. First, for each\ncountry separately, we standardized the continuous variables of educational\nattainment such that the national average was equal to 0 and the standard\ndeviation equal to 1 year of education (0.2% of the respondents with 26 to\n40 years of education were excluded from the analysis). This was done separately\nfor each age cohort within each country, for men and women separately.\nSecond, we inverted this variable by multiplying it by \u20131, such that higher\nvalues correspond to lower educational levels. Next, the standardized variable\nwas introduced as an independent variable in a logistic regression analysis,\ncontrolled for age and ESS-round, with health variables as the dependent\nvariable. Finally, odds ratios (ORs) were computed as the antilogarithm of the\nestimated logistic regression coefficients. The OR should be interpreted\nas the health difference between people with average years of education\nand those with years of education one standard deviation below the national\naverage. ORs of poor self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness are\npresented for men and women in six age groups within each of the four welfare\nstate regimes.\nA weight was applied in all analyses to correct for design effects due\nto sampling design in countries where not all individuals in the population have\nan identical selection probability. All analyses were done for men and\nwomen separately.\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 407\n408 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nTable 3\nSample size (N) and prevalence of poor self-rated health (SRH) and limiting\nlongstanding illness (LLI) in four welfare regimes and six age cohorts\nfor men and women separately (N = 85,514)\nAge group,\ndecade of\nbirth\nMen Women\nWelfare regime N SRH LLI N SRH LLI\n1930s\n1940s\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\n1,118\n620\n1,103\n1,983\n1,854\n899\n1,111\n2,936\n1,894\n903\n1,296\n3,618\n2,021\n1,006\n1,373\n3,822\n1,716\n845\n2,764\n1,931\n1,411\n876\n1,287\n3,057\n41.1\n31.9\n57.9\n41.8\n34.7\n31.0\n43.0\n35.3\n24.9\n20.2\n33.5\n26.8\n17.5\n15.2\n20.7\n19.6\n13.7\n12.3\n14.8\n14.2\n12.0\n13.1\n11.9\n11.8\n38.6\n34.5\n29.6\n36.1\n32.5\n29.1\n16.5\n28.7\n23.0\n20.4\n11.8\n21.4\n18.9\n14.2\n7.3\n14.9\n14.2\n9.7\n4.6\n10.4\n13.3\n8.3\n3.8\n9.5\n1,155\n612\n1,287\n2,060\n1,838\n992\n1,429\n3,007\n1,865\n1,118\n1,671\n3,929\n1,966\n1,262\n1,874\n4,787\n1,648\n992\n1,652\n3,019\n1,323\n955\n1,204\n2,900\n51.0\n37.4\n72.6\n51.4\n38.8\n28.1\n59.2\n39.1\n26.5\n20.6\n43.3\n29.7\n17.1\n15.1\n31.1\n21.5\n12.2\n12.5\n22.0\n18.1\n13.9\n8.7\n13.9\n15.7\n41.3\n33.3\n41.7\n40.2\n35.5\n28.5\n26.8\n30.4\n29.8\n18.9\n15.4\n23.9\n21.6\n13.1\n10.4\n15.8\n15.8\n10.8\n6.0\n12.1\n17.0\n6.2\n4.5\n10.1\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 presents odds ratios (y axes) for reporting poor self-assessed health\nand limiting longstanding illness according to educational attainment in\nfour welfare state regimes. Odds ratios are given for men and women separ-\nately within six different age groups (x axes). Exact ORs are given in\nAppendix Tables I and II (pp. 416\u2013417). The results are presented in line with\nour two research hypotheses.\nOur first research hypothesis, that patterns of educational inequalities in\nhealth will vary by age within welfare state regimes, being smaller among\nolder people, does not seem to be supported by the results shown in Figure 1.\nThe ORs seem to decrease in all regimes by age (from left to right), and they\nare smallest among the youngest age cohort (those born in the 1980s). However,\nto further clarify these findings, we have also estimated correlation coeffi-\ncients (by correlating ORs with one unit increase of age groups) for all regimes\n(see Table 4). Negative associations are evident in all regimes for men and\nwomen for both health indicators, although far from all are significant. The\nsummary measure of Table 4 shows that the associations of ORs and age are\nstrongest in the Southern regime (r = \u20130.72), intermediate in the Bismarckian\n(r = \u20130.48) and Scandinavian (r = \u20130.45), and weakest in the Anglo-Saxon\n(r = \u20130.23). We should add, however, that some of the observed lines in Figure 1\n(e.g., for ORs of LLI in Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon regimes) seem to be\ncurvilinear, increasing from the left and then decreasing again (even more) to\nthe right. In any case, the overall picture seems to be that health inequalities\nincrease by age group.\nThe second research hypothesis, that patterns of educational inequalities in\nhealth will vary by age between welfare state regimes, being smallest among the\nolder Scandinavian cohort, is correct in the first part. There is some patterning\nof educational inequalities by welfare state regime: inequalities in SRH and\nLLI tend to be smallest in either the Southern or Bismarckian regimes (with\nthe exception of the 1940s cohorts) and highest in the Scandinavian (with\nthe exception of LLI for the 1940s male cohort and the 1930s and 1940s\nfemale cohort). The second part of the hypothesis, that ORs will be smallest\namong the older Scandinavian cohort, is not supported by our results; on the\ncontrary, health inequalities are relatively large within this group, both for\nmen (ORLLI = 1.30, ORSRH = 1.35) and women (ORLLI = 1.19, ORSRH = 1.48).\nThe group with the smallest inequalities in SRH is the youngest (1980s)\nSouthern regime cohort (men, OR = 1.04; women, OR = 0.97), and for LLI\nthey are smallest among the 1980s female cohort in the Southern regime\n(OR = 0.90) and the 1980s male cohort in the Bismarckian regime (OR = 1.00).\nThe ORs among older Scandinavians are therefore not consistently lower than\nthose for younger Scandinavian age groups, nor are they lower than in other\nEuropean age groups.\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 409\n410 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 411\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\nO\nd\nd\ns\nra\nti\no\ns\n(y\nax\nes\n)\nan\nd\nag\ne\ng\nro\nu\np\ns\n(x\nax\nes\n)\nfo\nr\nm\nen\nan\nd\nw\no\nm\nen\nre\np\no\nrt\nin\ng\np\no\no\nr\nse\nlf\n-r\nat\ned\nh\nea\nlt\nh\n(S\nR\nH\n)\nan\nd\nli\nm\nit\nin\ng\nlo\nn\ng\nst\nan\nd\nin\ng\nil\nln\nes\ns\n(L\nL\nI)\nac\nco\nrd\nin\ng\nto\ned\nu\nca\nti\no\nn\n,\nin\nS\nca\nn\nd\nin\nav\nia\nn\n,\nA\nn\ng\nlo\n-S\nax\no\nn\n,\nS\no\nu\nth\ner\nn\n,\nan\nd\nB\nis\nm\nar\nck\nia\nn\nw\nel\nfa\nre\nre\ng\nim\nes\n.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results do not entirely support our two research hypotheses. For the first\nhypothesis, although patterns of educational inequalities in health did vary a\nlittle by age within welfare state regimes, they were not smaller among older\npeople. The extent of age-related differences in the magnitude of health inequal-\nities varied by welfare state regime, as, for example, age was more associated\nwith patterns of health inequalities in the Southern regime than in the others.\nThere were particularly notable decreases in inequalities in health among the\nyounger groups in the Southern countries\u2014perhaps reflecting the beneficial\neffects of the shift away from dictatorship (4). Overall, however, health inequal-\nities tended to increase with age\u2014not decrease as predicted by our hypothesis.\nThis is counterintuitive from a welfare state development perspective, as the older\ncohorts experienced stronger and more redistributive welfare state contexts (with\nthe exception of those in Southern regime countries). However, the finding is in\nkeeping with those of a recent longitudinal study of self-rated health, which found\nthat social inequalities in health widened with age in all four welfare states under\nstudy (United States, Britain, Germany, and Denmark) (19). That study also\nnoted that educational health inequalities were not apparent until people were\nover 25 years of age, which is similar to our finding that health inequalities are\nsmallest among the youngest age group (born in the 1980s). This may be because\n412 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nTable 4\nCorrelations between odds ratios of poor self-rated health (SRH) and\nlimiting longstanding illness (LLI) and (one unit increase of) age groups,\nfor men and women separately\nWelfare\nregime\nCorrelation coefficients (Pearson\u2019s r)\nSummary\nby regime\nPoor SRH LLI\nMen Women Men Women\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\n\u20130.74*\n\u20130.52\n\u20130.58\n\u20130.51\n\u20130.89**\n\u20130.29\n\u20130.92***\n\u20130.57\n\u20130.55\n\u20130.39\n\u20130.49\n\u20130.73*\n\u20130.33\n\u20130.29\n\u20130.92***\n\u20130.17\n\u20130.45**\n\u20130.23\n\u20130.72***\n\u20130.48**\nNote: Age cohorts are given values from 1 (born in the 1930s) to 6 (born in the 1980s) in the\ncorrelation analyses.\n***p < 0.01; **p < 0.05; *p < 0.10\nill health is a rarer event in all social classes at younger ages. Furthermore, the\nhigher levels of decommodification provided by the older welfare states would\nhave affected income inequalities through redistribution, but this may not affect\ninequalities in health in the same way\u2014as Dahl and coauthors (16) comment, it\nis more difficult to redistribute health than income. Finally, the older groups\nexperienced the better welfare state provision in earlier periods of their lives,\nwhereas now (when health outcomes are being measured), perhaps when these\nolder people are most in need, they experience the reformed, less generous,\nwelfare state provision.\nSimilarly, with our second hypothesis, although patterns of educational\ninequalities in health varied by age among welfare state regimes, they were not\nsmallest for the Scandinavian regime or among the older Scandinavian cohorts.\nThis hypothesis was developed by a desire to assess the consistency, across\ndifferent age groups, of the finding that health inequalities are not lowest in the\nScandinavian countries. In this respect, our findings are in keeping with the\nbroader literature, as the Bismarckian and Southern regimes fairly consistently\nexhibited smaller educational inequalities in health across most age groups and\namong both men and women. Various studies of self-rated health and mortality\nhave come to the same conclusion (10\u201312, 14). Our results, therefore, like those\nin earlier studies, are very challenging in terms of theorizing the relationship\nbetween welfare state inputs and health inequalities outputs. Speculative reasons\nfor the relative underperformance of the Scandinavian model in the area of\nhealth inequalities (as opposed to overall population health) have been suggested\nelsewhere (18, 34\u201336), These include artifact (the results are not real but due to the\nmeasures used in the studies), health selection (the social consequences of ill\nhealth are greater in the Scandinavian countries), health behaviors (socioeconomic\ninequalities in smoking are much higher in the Scandinavian countries than in\nother welfare state regimes), health care services (tentative evidence suggests that\ninequalities in mortality as a result of diseases amenable to medical intervention\nare higher in the Scandinavian countries), or relative deprivation (the health\neffects of relative deprivation may be more extensive in the Scandinavian welfare\nstates, because these regimes generate, but do not meet, high levels of expectation\nof upward social mobility and prosperity) (18, 34\u201337).\nThese explanations, coupled with our results, suggest that there is a need\nto integrate details about other, more conventionally analyzed, public health\ninfluences (such as smoking rates, health care provision) into the welfare state\nregime approach\u2014termed elsewhere \u201cpublic health regimes\u201d (38, 39). The\nwelfare state regime concept has many uses in untangling the complexities\nof comparing different countries and systems. However, it is perhaps rather\nlimited for getting down to the minute details of how and why inequalities\nin health are generated (18). Thus there is a need to make more precise\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 413\ncomparisons among the different welfare state life courses of groups in\nparticular welfare states (and welfare state regimes) (15). For example, a\ndetailed case study could be made that compares the average welfare state\nlife course experiences of different educational and age groups in the\nUnited Kingdom with those of the same groups in Sweden. Finally, there\nis a clear need for better\u2014longitudinal\u2014data to comprehensively assess\nour hypotheses.\nLimitations of the Study\n1. Longitudinal data suitable for studying the effects of welfare state regime\nlife courses on health inequalities are now being collected (e.g., the Survey\nof Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, wave 3), but they are not\nyet available. We attempted to overcome this lack of data by examining\nhealth inequalities in different age cohorts, using cross-sectional cross-\nnational data. We are justified in this approach by the age-structuring of the\nlife course, especially pertaining to education (23). However, the study is sub-\nject to the usual limitations of this study design, and longitudinal data would\nbe much preferred.\n2. Although a growing number of studies have shown that the measure of\nself-assessed health is strongly correlated with more objective measures such\nas mortality (40, 41), we cannot exclude the possibility of a substantial, additional\neffect of cultural differences.\n3. The European Social Survey presents an outstanding opportunity to\ninvestigate cross-national patterns of health inequality among age groups,\nas the survey asks the same questions in all countries. But we acknowledge\nthat many issues may affect the comparability of multi-country studies, such\nas non-response (see Table 2), modes of data collection, translations, and\nconduct of the study. This applies especially to the first wave in Switzerland,\nwhich had a response rate of only 33.5 percent. If non-response is related to\nhealth and education, then this would produce biased inequality measures.\nAnother methodological issue is that our sample comes from three sweeps\nof the ESS.\n4. As noted earlier, the concept of welfare state regimes and their develop-\nment is itself rather limiting, as it places very generalized and broad parameters\naround how welfare states evolve over time. The four phases and associated\ntime periods used in our study are therefore very approximate, and there are\nclear differences both between and within regimes in terms of the time periods\nwhen welfare states developed. For example, Sweden did not do any restructur-\ning until the 1990s recession, whereas the reform period in the United Kingdom\nstarted in the early 1980s. The Southern regime countries (with the exception\n414 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nof Italy) also had a different developmental trajectory, with dictatorships\nthat lasted until the 1970s. Similarly, there are within-regime differences,\nas Finland\u2019s welfare state developed much later than that of the other Scan-\ndinavian countries.\n5. The choice of welfare state typology may well have influenced the results.\nThere are various welfare state typologies in circulation, which configure the\ncomposition of the regimes in different ways. Most notably for this study, the\nNavarro and Shi typology (42) has a more concisely defined Southern (late\ndemocracy) welfare state regime, which excludes Italy. If a different welfare state\ntypology were used, our results might have been different. However, the Ferrera\ntypology (26) is well-tested in health research and has been assessed as the most\nempirically accurate.\n6. We have used education as our measure of socioeconomic inequalities.\nThis was done because education is seen as a less volatile measure than income\nor occupation (32). However, as many epidemiological studies have shown, the\nextent of health inequalities can sometimes depend on how they are measured\n(32). This has also been demonstrated in studies of health inequalities by welfare\nstate regime that use income as the indicator of inequality, which produce slightly\ndifferent country and welfare state regime patterning than the education measure\n(12, 14). We therefore acknowledge that a different indicator of socioeconomic\nstatus might change our results.\nCONCLUSION\nThis is the first study to examine health inequalities by age and welfare state\nregime across Western Europe. Like many previous studies of health inequalities\nby welfare state regime, the findings are in contrast to theoretical expectations,\nas the Scandinavian countries did not have the smallest inequalities. This may\nbe because the welfare state regime concept is too broad, or because it ignores\nthe influence on health inequalities of other important public health factors\n(such as health care provision and smoking rates). Public health regimes\nmay therefore be a more productive way forward in terms of analyzing cross-\nnational variations in health inequalities. The article has also outlined a new\nconcept\u2014that of welfare state life courses\u2014and this is something that can\nbe further developed theoretically and examined in more detail empirically.\nThis, perhaps, could best be done by looking in more detail at how institutional\nsettings shape the life course and health outcomes in the welfare states of\njust one welfare state regime type, preferably using longitudinal data. To\ndevelop the concept and assess its value for public health research, more\nprecise empirical comparisons are needed than can be offered by this exploratory\necological overview.\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 415\n416 \/ Bambra, Netuveli, and Eikemo\nAPPENDIX TABLE I\nOdds ratios (95% confidence interval) of reporting poor self-rated health\naccording to education within four welfare regimes and six age groups,\nfor men and women separately (N = 85,514)\nAge group,\ndecade of birth Welfare regime Men Women\n1930s\n1940s\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\n1.35 (1.19\u20131.53)\n1.40 (1.16\u20131.69)\n1.29 (1.14\u20131.46)\n1.28 (1.16\u20131.40)\n1.40 (1.26\u20131.55)\n1.52 (1.29\u20131.78)\n1.37 (1.21\u20131.55)\n1.28 (1.18\u20131.38)\n1.36 (1.22\u20131.51)\n1.25 (1.06\u20131.48)\n1.43 (1.26\u20131.62)\n1.25 (1.16\u20131.35)\n1.42 (1.26\u20131.61)\n1.29 (1.07\u20131.55)\n1.16 (1.01\u20131.33)\n1.32 (1.21\u20131.43)\n1.23 (1.07\u20131.41)\n1.20 (0.97\u20131.48)\n1.35 (1.16\u20131.57)\n1.32 (1.18\u20131.47)\n1.14 (0.93\u20131.39)\n1.36 (1.10\u20131.69)\n1.04 (0.88\u20131.23)\n1.05 (0.92\u20131.18)\n1.48 (1.30\u20131.68)\n1.19 (1.00\u20131.41)\n1.49 (1.32\u20131.68)\n1.28 (1.17\u20131.40)\n1.49 (1.34\u20131.65)\n1.35 (1.16\u20131.57)\n1.42 (1.27\u20131.59)\n1.22 (1.13\u20131.31)\n1.49 (1.34\u20131.67)\n1.17 (1.01\u20131.36)\n1.46 (1.31\u20131.62)\n1.33 (1.23\u20131.43)\n1.45 (1.29\u20131.64)\n1.20 (1.02\u20131.40)\n1.24 (1.12\u20131.38)\n1.33 (1.23\u20131.43)\n1.34 (1.16\u20131.54)\n1.39 (1.14\u20131.68)\n1.23 (1.10\u20131.39)\n1.23 (1.12\u20131.35)\n1.28 (1.06\u20131.54)\n1.26 (1.00\u20131.58)\n0.97 (0.81\u20131.15)\n1.05 (0.93\u20131.18)\nNote: Bold indicates significant differences by education (p < 0.05).\nWelfare State Regime Life Courses \/ 417\nAPPENDIX TABLE II\nOdds ratios (95% confidence interval) of reporting limiting longstanding illness\naccording to education within four welfare regimes and six age groups,\nfor men and women separately (N = 85,514)\nAge group,\ndecade of birth Welfare regime Men Women\n1930s\n1940s\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\nScandinavian\nAnglo-Saxon\nSouthern\nBismarckian\n1.30 (1.15\u20131.48)\n1.25 (1.05\u20131.49)\n1.31 (1.13\u20131.50)\n1.19 (1.08\u20131.30)\n1.19 (1.08\u20131.32)\n1.37 (1.17\u20131.61)\n1.61 (1.33\u20131.95)\n1.27 (1.16\u20131.38)\n1.31 (1.17\u20131.46)\n1.48 (1.24\u20131.76)\n1.39 (1.15\u20131.68)\n1.30 (1.19\u20131.41)\n1.32 (1.17\u20131.48)\n1.15 (0.96\u20131.38)\n1.27 (1.03\u20131.58)\n1.16 (1.06\u20131.27)\n1.25 (1.09\u20131.43)\n1.22 (0.96\u20131.54)\n1.47 (1.14\u20131.89)\n1.15 (1.02\u20131.30)\n1.05 (0.86\u20131.29)\n1.23 (0.96\u20131.57)\n1.10 (0.82\u20131.46)\n1.00 (0.87\u20131.15)\n1.19 (1.05\u20131.35)\n1.22 (1.02\u20131.46)\n1.65 (1.45\u20131.89)\n1.16 (1.06\u20131.27)\n1.33 (1.20\u20131.47)\n1.18 (1.02\u20131.36)\n1.54 (1.33\u20131.77)\n1.10 (1.01\u20131.19)\n1.30 (1.17\u20131.44)\n1.24 (1.06\u20131.45)\n1.43 (1.23\u20131.66)\n1.25 (1.16\u20131.35)\n1.38 (1.24\u20131.54)\n1.09 (0.92\u20131.29)\n1.47 (1.25\u20131.73)\n1.22 (1.12\u20131.32)\n1.32 (1.16\u20131.51)\n1.36 (1.11\u20131.67)\n1.24 (1.01\u20131.52)\n1.20 (1.08\u20131.34)\n1.17 (0.98\u20131.40)\n1.01 (0.76\u20131.35)\n0.90 (0.67\u20131.21)\n1.06 (0.93\u20131.22)\nNote: Bold indicates significant differences by education (p < 0.05).\nREFERENCES\n1.
