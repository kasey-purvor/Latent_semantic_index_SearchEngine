We use data from the 1996 British Social Attitudes Survey \nto investigate the interacting effects of different domains of scientific and contextual \nknowledge on public attitudes toward science.  The results point to the clear importance of \nknowledge as a determinant of attitudes toward science. However, in contrast to the rather \nsimplistic deficit model that has traditionally characterised discussions of this relationship, \nthis analysis highlights the complex and interacting nature of the knowledge-attitude \ninterface. \n \n \n \n \n1\nScience in Society: Re-evaluating the Deficit Model of Public Attitudes1 \n \nTHE DEFICIT MODEL AND ITS CRITICS \nThe field of study known as \u2018public understanding of science\u2019 stands today at \nsomething of a crossroads (Miller 2001).  In the fifteen years or so since the publication of \nthe Bodmer report by the Royal Society (Bodmer 1985), the loose assemblage of \ninterdisciplinary approaches that have been applied to the field has produced much in the \nway of practical educational initiatives such as \u2018Science, Technology and Engineering Week\u2019 \nin the UK and \u2018Project 2061\u2019 in the United States. Many other science popularisation \ninitiatives in the UK have been  funded through the Committee for Public Understanding of \nScience (COPUS).  Scholarship has also flourished, with much funding directed at academic \nresearch into science communication and public attitudes towards science and technology.   \nA major aim of COPUS was not only to popularise science, but also to enhance the \n\u2018scientific literacy\u2019 of the British public.  The Bodmer report was commissioned in the belief \nthat the public\u2019s interest in and support for science and scientists was waning. At the same \ntime, scientists themselves had retreated from public debate to an alarming degree. The \nreport suggested not only that scientists now had a duty to go out and communicate the \nbenefits of science to a wider public, but also that a more  \u2018scientifically literate\u2019 public would \nbe more supportive of scientific research programs and more enthusiastic about \ntechnological innovations. This would, of course, be a rather happy outcome for the scientific \nresearch community.  \nA scientifically literate citizenry is also one that can effectively participate in public \ndebates about science and hold government to account over the speed and direction of \nscience policy. From this normative perspective, in modern democratic societies, citizens \nneed to have sufficient levels of accurate information on which to base their assessments of \npolicy alternatives in order that their policy preferences best reflect their own self or group \n 2\ninterests (Converse 1964, Delli-Carpini and Keeter 1996). As scientific and technological \ninnovations become increasingly central to the functioning of modern societies and to the \ndaily lives of individual citizens, the argument goes, so the importance of technical and \nscientific knowledge within the mass public is concomitantly augmented.  \nThere is little doubt, however, that one of the primary motives underlying recent \ngovernment and business initiatives to increase public \u2018understanding\u2019 of science is what \nNelkin (1995) calls \u2018selling science\u2019  (see for example Office of Science and Technology and \nthe Wellcome Trust 2001). Implicit or explicit, in this programmatic agenda is the claim that \n\u2018to know science is to love it\u2019.  That is to say, the more one knows about science, the more \nfavourable one\u2019s attitude towards it will be. Regrettably, from this point of view at least, \npublics both in Europe and in the United States appear to possess depressingly low levels of \nscientific knowledge. Jon Miller conceptualises \u2018civic scientific literacy\u2019 as comprising three \nrelated dimensions:  \u2018a vocabulary of basic scientific constructs sufficient to read competing \nviews in a newspaper or magazine\u2026an understanding of the process or nature of scientific \ninquiry\u2026some level of understanding of the impact of science and technology on individuals \nand on society\u2019 (Miller 1998). While Miller\u2019s concept is by no means an uncontested one, on \nhis definition not more than one quarter of the European and US publics qualify as \nscientifically literate. Moreover, this situation has hardly changed since systematic \nmeasurements first began in the late 1950s, despite the best efforts of governments and \neducators alike to popularise science and make it more accessible to ordinary citizens during \nthe intervening years. Withey (1959) found that In 1957 only about 10 percent of Americans \ncorrectly defined science as having to do with the concepts of controlled experimentation, \ntheory and systematic variation. Fifteen years later, when the U.S. National Science \nFoundation (NSF) initiated its Science Indicators survey series, the proportion was \nunchanged (Gregory and Miller 1998).  In 1988, Durant, Evans and Thomas (1989) reported \nthat only 17 percent of the British public spontaneously referred to experimentation and\/or \ntheory testing when asked the question: \u2018what does it mean to study something \n \n \n \n \n3\nscientifically?\u2019 When the same question was asked nearly a decade later, in the 1996 British \nSocial Attitudes survey (Jowell, Curtice, Park, Brook, Thomson and Bryson 1997), the \nproportion remained statistically unchanged at 18 percent. The picture for what might be \nconsidered \u2018factual\u2019 or \u2018textbook\u2019 scientific knowledge is similar.  For instance, Durant, Evans \nand Thomas (1989) report that in 1988 only 34 percent of the British public knew that the \nearth goes around the sun once a year and only 28 percent knew that antibiotics kill bacteria \nbut not viruses (see appendix for more factual knowledge questions from this survey). In the \nUSA, respondents faced with the same questions fared similarly to their British counterparts, \nwith 46 and 25 percent providing the correct answer respectively. \nAgainst this backdrop of widespread scientific \u2018ignorance\u2019 amongst lay publics, there \nhas been, over the past few decades, rising public scepticism about the benefits of scientific \nand technological innovation and a diminishing conviction that scientific progress is \ncoterminous with social progress (Hargreaves 2000, Touraine 1985).  In Britain, this view \nmotivated a major public inquiry into the relationship between science and society by the \nHouse of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000) which suggested that \n\u2018society's relationship with science is in a critical phase\u2019 characterised by \u2018public unease, \nmistrust and occasional outright hostility\u2019.  Unease of this kind has been evident in public \ncontroversies a number of years, concerning, for example, the real and potential dangers of \nDDT in the early 1960s, nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s and, more recently, crises in \npublic confidence in farming and food technologies following the BSE scandal in Britain in the \n1990s. Typifying this state of affairs at present is gene technology.  While held out by some \nas promising almost limitless future benefits for society, optimism about these prospects in \nEurope has steadily declined since the beginning of the 1990s (Gaskell, Allum, Wagner, \nHviid Nielsen, Jelsoe, Kohring and Bauer 2001). The scientific community, along with \ngovernments and industry, all now recognise that a sufficiently hostile public and media can \n 4\nseriously constrain or even veto a contentious research program (Miller, Pardo and Niwa \n1997). \nThe assumption that it is a lack of public understanding or knowledge that has led to \nthe present climate of scepticism toward science underpins what has come to be known as \nthe \u2018deficit model\u2019 (Layton, Jenkins, McGill and Davey 1993, Wynne 1991, Ziman 1991). In \nthis formulation, it is the public that are assumed to be \u2018deficient\u2019, while science is \u2018sufficient\u2019 \n(Gross 1994).  The public\u2019s doubts about the value of scientific progress or fears about new \nor unfamiliar innovations, such as genetically modified organisms or microwave ovens, are \ndue to ignorance of the science behind them. Lacking a proper understanding of the relevant \nfacts, people fall back on mystical beliefs and irrational fears of the unknown. If one accepts \nthis hypothesis, the obvious implication for science policy is that public information \ncampaigns should be instigated to remedy the public\u2019s disenchantment with science. Whilst \nthe deficit model, as we shall refer to it here, is to some extent a simplification, or even \nsomething of a \u2018straw man\u2019, it quite evidently underlies many programmatic statements from \nthe scientific community when the misplaced fears of a scientifically illiterate public and mass \nmedia are bemoaned (Evans and Durant 1995). And the simple logic of the deficit model is \nsupported by a good deal of cross-national empirical evidence for a robust but not especially \nstrong positive correlation between \u2018textbook\u2019 scientific knowledge and favourability of \nattitude toward science (e.g. Bauer, Durant and Evans 1994, Evans and Durant 1995, \nGaskell, Allum, Wagner, Hviid Nielsen, Jelsoe, Kohring and Bauer 2001, Grimston 1994, \nMcBeth and Oakes 1996, Miller, Pardo and Niwa 1997, Sturgis and Allum 2000, Sturgis and \nAllum 2001).  \nUnsurprisingly, given its normative and epistemological implications, the deficit model \nhas come in for sustained criticism on a number of grounds.  Firstly, the assumption that so-\ncalled \u2018irrational\u2019 fears of lay publics are based on lack of scientific understanding has been \nstrongly challenged by a number of commentators.  Douglas and Wildavsky (1982), for \nexample, have argued that people\u2019s fears about new technologies are functional in that they \n \n \n \n \n5\nprovide a basis for maintaining cultural associations.  In other words, people select risks to \nworry about according to the norms of their social milieu rather than responding to \nsupposedly more \u2018objective\u2019 hazards.  Others have shown that perceptions of technological \nrisks are related to certain types of worldview (Slovic and Peters 1998) or the holding of \ncertain core beliefs and values such as environmentalism. In none of these conceptions is \nthe perception of risk dependent primarily on one\u2019s level of scientific understanding. \nAnother criticism of the deficit model and the way in which it has been approached via \nquantitative survey research focuses on the selection of appropriate measures of scientific \nunderstanding (Hayes and Tariq 2000, Peters 2000). The argument is made that proponents \nand opponents in scientific controversies are likely to select different domains of knowledge \nas being relevant or important (Peters 2000). The normative assumptions behind the \nselection and development of knowledge measures such as those of Withey, Miller, Evans \nand Durant may not necessarily correspond with those of all protagonists in any given \nscientific controversy.  Peters (2000), for example, criticises some of the knowledge \nmeasures used in the 1992 Eurobarometer survey (INRA 1993) as being based on a \n\u2018culturally determined idealisation\u2019 of what should constitute scientific knowledge.  As a \nresult, he argues, the measures present a biased indication of the relative levels of relevant \nscientific understanding that is dependent on respondents\u2019 national and cultural locations. \nAnother recent current of criticism of the deficit model suggests that the effect of scientific \nknowledge is far outweighed by the influence of social trust on people\u2019s perceptions of new \nand potentially risky technologies (Priest 2001, Priest 2001, Siegrist, Cvetkovich and Roth \n2000). \nWhile these criticisms are undoubtedly in many ways valid, they do not, in our view, \nsufficiently problematise the deficit model to justify scrapping it entirely.  Indeed, we find it \npuzzling that many scholars utilising survey research methods that consistently uncover \nassociations between knowledge of and attitudes towards science, despite controlling for a \n 6\nrange of other important characteristics such as age, education and social class, often \nchoose to ignore this finding and instead emphasise the other factors that are also influential \nin the formation of attitudes (Hayes and Tariq 2000, Hayes and Tariq 2001, Priest 2001, \nSturgis and Allum 2001). It is quite clear that culture, economic factors, social and political \nvalues and worldviews are all important in determining the public\u2019s attitude towards science.  \nThere is, however, no reason to assume in consequence that scientific knowledge does not \nhave an additional and independent influence, for reasons that are thus far not clearly \nunderstood.  In fact there is ample reason to consider it quite implausible that the well-\ninformed and poorly informed citizen go about the business of making up their minds in the \nsame way (Sniderman, Glaser and Griffin 1990).    \n \nTHE CONTEXTUALIST PERSPECTIVE \nA more trenchant critique is one which suggests the existence of other knowledge \ndomains that influence attitudes towards science and technology in opposite or conflicting \nways to factual scientific knowledge. Jasanoff, for example, suggests that what is important \nfor people\u2019s understanding of science is not so much the ability to recall large numbers of \nmiscellaneous facts but rather \u2018a keen appreciation of the places where science and \ntechnology articulate smoothly with one\u2019s experience of life\u2026and of the trustworthiness of \nexpert claims and institutions\u2019 (Jasanoff 2000).  Brian Wynne, an incisive critic of the deficit \nmodel of PUS, delineates this position further. Criticising survey-based PUS research\u2019s over-\nreliance on simple \u2018textbook\u2019 knowledge scales, he suggests that in order to properly capture \nthe range of knowledge domains relevant to lay attitudes towards scientific research \nprogrammes \u2018three elements of public understanding have to be expressly related: the formal \ncontents of scientific knowledge; the methods and processes of science; and its forms of \ninstitutional embedding, patronage, organisation and control\u2019 (Wynne 1992) \nClearly the implication of what we shall here refer to as the \u2018contextualist\u20192 position is \nthat the deficit model considers only the first two of these elements and that, in neglecting the \n \n \n \n \n7\ndifferent forms of engagement that individuals and groups might have with science in a \nvariety of contexts, PUS research has overstated the importance of the simple linear deficit \nmodel.  Other knowledges - be it intimate knowledge of working procedures at a nuclear \npower plant or awareness of the practical political interdependencies between government, \nindustry and scientific institutions - will always be moderating factors. The ways in which \npeople utilise their factual scientific knowledge is contextualised by the circumstances under \nconsideration.  As a corollary to this line of argument we can assume that the third element in \nthis formulation will influence public attitudes in ways opposite to or conflicting with the first \ntwo elements. If not, then it would appear to be nothing other than a somewhat more \nelaborated restatement of the deficit model.   \nIn this vein, Steven Yearley highlights public trust in scientific expertise as a key \nfactor in the contextualisation of knowledge of science (Yearley 2000).  Trust in expert \nclaims, he argues, is always mediated by knowledge of the institutional arrangements under \nwhich expertise is authorised. Claims to expert knowledge are always contestable depending \non what one knows of the relevant institutions.  For instance, claims made by government \nexperts may be evaluated differently to those made by scientists employed by non-\ngovernmental organisations.  At this point, trust becomes the issue.  Of course, in making \nthese evaluations, other psychological and social factors come into play: political ideology, \npersonal interests and preferences.  Nevertheless, all things being equal, some form of \n\u2018institutional knowledge\u2019 will serve in this example to contextualise \u2018factual\u2019 scientific \nknowledge and knowledge of scientific methods when people evaluate the science under \nconsideration.   \nWynne and others who have been instrumental in the articulation of the contextualist \nperspective have argued that a survey-based, quantitative approach cannot shed any useful \nlight on this or other contextualising forms of knowledge.  In fact, it would not be an \nexaggeration to say that one of the central axioms of this perspective seems to be that \n 8\nsurvey-based methods are at best procrustean and at worst fundamentally misleading for \nunderstanding lay publics\u2019 knowledge of and interactions with science (Wynne 1995). The \nprincipal contention is that \u2018surveys take the respondent out of [their] social context and are \nintrinsically unable to examine or control analytically for the potentially variable, socially \nrooted meanings that key terms have for social actors\u2019 (Wynne 1995).  Methodologically, the \ncontextualist perspective has relied instead on qualitative case studies for empirical support \n(e.g. Irwin and Wynne 1996, Kerr, Cunningham-Burley and Amos 1998, Michael 1992, \nMichael 1996). A contextualist theoretical outlook and a quantitative methodological \napproach are, apparently, incommensurable from this perspective.  \nThis conflation of theory and method - with contextualist perspectives requiring an \nideographic\/qualitative approach and quantitative\/survey based research seen as good only \nfor propounding the deficit model \u2013 is, we believe, both an unnecessary and an unhelpful \nstate of affairs. As Einsiedel astutely remarks: \u2018Contrasting [the deficit model] with the \ninteractive science model3 may have analytical value, but one thereby tends to emphasise \nthe stark differences between the two and to overlook the possibility that these frameworks \nmay be complementary rather than mutually exclusive\u2019 (Einsiedel 2000). Furthermore, the \nidea that survey based analyses are not capable of or suitable for demonstrating a \ncontingent or mediated relationship between knowledge and attitude does not bear close \nscrutiny. Evans and Durant (1995), for example, show that while the simple deficit model \nholds for attitudes to science in general, better informed respondents tend to be among the \nmost sceptical when it comes to \u2018morally contentious\u2019 and \u2018non-useful\u2019 sciences.  Similarly, \nBauer, Evans and Durant (1994), in another multi-variate statistical analysis, show that the \nstrength of the knowledge-attitude relationship varies across Europe according to national \nlevels of economic advancement.  However, while these studies demonstrate, through \nquantitative analysis, the contingent nature of the knowledge attitude nexus, they do not \nfocus specifically on the mediational or contextualising form of knowledge as set out, \nhowever imprecisely, by those propounding this theoretical model. \n \n \n \n \n9\n The present research is motivated by a concern to address this gap in the empirical \nliterature; we believe that potentially valuable theoretical insights and developments in the \nfield of public understanding of science are being stymied by the paradigmatic formalisms \nand methodological orthodoxies of divergent research traditions. Rather than seeing the \ncontextualist perspective as a potentially decisive critique of the deficit model, we hope in this \npaper to show how these two theoretical perspectives might be integrated in a more complex \nand complete account of how what people know about science and the context in which it is \npractised affects their general favourability toward science and the scientific community. In \nusing a quantitative, survey based approach as the vehicle in this regard, we do not aim to \npick it out as the methodological \u2018royal road\u2019, but, rather, aim to illustrate how both the deficit \nand contextualist models might be investigated from this particular perspective. \n \nMEASURING CONTEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE \nThe key problem, of course, in integrating the contextualist perspective within a \nsurvey based quantitative analysis is obtaining satisfactory operationalisations of the relevant \nknowledge domains. Finding adequate indicators of hypothetical and unobservable concepts \nis difficult at the best of times (Hox, 1997). The process is at its most treacherous when, as in \nthe current instance, the concepts in question are \u2018fuzzy\u2019, multi-dimensional and, to a large \ndegree, contested. However, the potentiality of biased or unreliable measurement should not, \nwe would argue, lead us to abandon the idea that there might be something of interest to be \nmeasured. Rather, the question that needs to be addressed is: how can we obtain the best \nmeasurements?   \nThe notion of contextualising knowledge is not, to be sure, a domain of specified and \nparticular content in and of itself. Rather, it expresses the idea of an interacting causal \nmechanism between two or more independent variables and an unspecified dependent \nvariable. Earlier we briefly reviewed some of the definitions and examples that proponents of \n 10\nthe contextualist perspective have suggested might constitute knowledge domains that act in \nsuch a way in combination with factual scientific knowledge and attitudes toward science. We \nwould summarise these as falling into either of two main categories: \u2018institutional knowledge \nof science\u2019 denoting an understanding of the ways in which science is embedded within \nwider political, economic and regulatory settings and \u2018local knowledge\u2019 which we take to \nmean knowledge of the ways in which specific applications of science or technology connect \nwith everyday practices in particular contexts. As we are here focusing on the national \npicture, using data that is representative of the GB population rather than any specific \nlocalities, we focus our attention on the former of these. There is, however, no reason why \nthe analytical approach we adopt here could not equally well be applied to small area data if \nan appropriate measure of the relevant \u2018local knowledge\u2019 in question were available. \nSo how does one go about measuring the average citizen\u2019s knowledge of the political \nand institutional relationships in which science and the development of science policy and \nregulation is embedded? Well, here we propose that the answer truly is in the question. For \nwhat we are surely dealing with here is a kind of \u2018political sophistication\u2019 \u2013 a concept which \nhas undergone a great deal of theoretical and empirical scrutiny in the field of political \nscience over the last thirty or so years (Luskin 1987). This programme of research has \nrepeatedly demonstrated that, firstly, individual citizens vary enormously in the amount they \nknow about politics and that, secondly, one\u2019s level of political knowledge has a significant \nimpact on one\u2019s political preferences, likelihood of voting and a whole host of other important \nbehaviours, attitudes and beliefs (Converse 2000, Delli-Carpini and Keeter 1996). What it \nhas also shown is that, as with most areas of knowledge or intelligence, in politics people \ntend to be \u2018generalists\u2019, such that their level of knowledge in any one particular domain will \nbe highly predictive of their level of knowledge in another. So people who know the names \nand faces of political \u2018actors\u2019 also tend to know about the institutions of government and \nwhere parties and candidates stand on the major issues of the day.  For example, Delli \nCarpini and Keeter have shown that, in two recent US surveys, the average correlation \n \n \n \n \n11\nbetween scales measuring knowledge about political \u2018players\u2019 and the policy stances of \npolitical parties is approximately .80.  They also find that, in a range of US surveys, the \nlowest correlation between sub-domains of political knowledge (drawn from a pool of ten \ndifferent domains) is as high as .52, while the greatest is .97. \nBased on results like these, we would argue that if we can distinguish between \nindividuals in terms of their level of political knowledge, such a measure is also likely to be \ndiscriminative of the extent to which people are aware of the political and institutional \nrelationships within which the practice and regulation of science and technology is located. \nLet us not forget, after all, that the ways in which science is practised, regulated and \ndeployed in society is still essentially a \u2018political\u2019 matter. \nSo while political knowledge batteries - as routinely implemented in surveys of \npolitical attitudes and behaviour - are clearly not direct measures of the \u2018institutional \nknowledge of science\u2019 construct as set out above, we believe that they will likely act as \nreasonably good proxies: people who are knowledgeable about political parties and the issue \npositions they endorse, are also more likely to be familiar with existing forms of scientific \nregulation, government committee structures, the nature of links between science, industry \nand government and so forth.   \nAn additional reason for preferring this particular operationalisation in the analysis is \nthe difficulty of obtaining purely factual \u2018answers\u2019 to any questions that might otherwise be \nused as indicators.  Bauer, Petkova and Boyadjieva (2000) have developed a set of items \ndesigned to measure what they also term \u2018institutional knowledge of science\u2019. They found \nthat \u2018institutional knowledge\u2019 comprises two sub-domains of belief about a) the autonomy of \nscientists and b) the ways in which institutions function. However, they themselves \nacknowledge the potential pitfalls of trying to directly assess this type of knowledge by \npointing to what they the see as the inherently contested nature of \u2018facts\u2019 about institutions. \nAs a result, the problem with Bauer et al.\u2019s scale is that too many of the items, in the absence \n 12\nof any objective means of determining the \u2018correct\u2019 response, stray from the knowledge into \nthe attitudinal domain4. As we are here primarily interested in how different domains of \nknowledge impact on attitude toward science, we feel that it is of paramount importance to \nemploy measures of knowledge that have, without descending into solipsism, easily \nverifiable right or wrong answers. It is therefore, we believe, preferable to use a less direct \nbut verifiably a knowledge based measure of our key theoretical construct than a more direct \nbut also a more ambiguous and contestable one. \n \nANALYSIS \nFrom the discussion above it is possible to deduce a number of empirical hypotheses \nconcerning the relationship between the favourability of people\u2019s attitudes toward science \nand their level of political and scientific sophistication. These are tested on data from a \nsurvey of a representative sample of the British population. Firstly, then, the deficit model \nholds that a generally negative attitude toward science is underpinned by, inter alia, a lack of \n\u2018textbook\u2019 scientific knowledge.  Our first hypothesis therefore becomes: \n \nH1 \u2013 The main effect of scientific knowledge on general attitude toward science \u2013 \ncontrolling for a range of important demographic characteristics - will be significant and \npositive. \n \nThe contextualist account, on the other hand, contends that understanding of the \nrelationships between political and financial institutions and the scientific community is at \nleast as important as scientific knowledge and will, in the aggregate, serve to diminish or \neven counteract any simple positive linear relationship between textbook scientific \nknowledge and attitude toward science. Our second hypothesis is therefore: \n \n \n \n \n \n13\nH2 \u2013 The main effect of political knowledge on general attitude toward science \u2013 \ncontrolling for a range of important demographic characteristics and scientific knowledge - \nwill be significant and negative. \n \nIf the contextualist account is correct, we would also expect that political knowledge \nwill act to moderate the effect of scientific knowledge in the formation of attitudes.  In other \nwords, for people with a lot of knowledge about politics and institutional decision-making, \nscientific knowledge will not be related to attitudes in the same way as it is for those without \nmuch political awareness.  Accordingly, our third hypothesis is: \n \nH3 \u2013 The effect of scientific knowledge on attitude toward science will vary as a \nfunction of level of political knowledge. \n \nFinally, the contextualist account sees contextual knowledge as a kind of \u2018protective \nfilter\u2019, endowing us with an important scepticism concerning the aims, objectivity and \nindependence of the scientific community. Thus, while we might expect to see a strong \ncorrelation between textbook scientific knowledge and acceptance of science for those less \nknowledgeable in this domain, any such relationship should also steadily diminish as the \nstock of political knowledge increases. Our fourth hypothesis (conditional on non-rejection of \nH3) therefore becomes: \n \nH3b - the positive effect of scientific knowledge on attitude toward science will be \ngreatest at low levels of political knowledge and will be much diminished at higher levels of \npolitical knowledge. \n \n 14\nThese hypotheses are tested using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression on a \nscale measuring favourability of attitude toward science and applications of scientific \nknowledge. Data come from the 1996 British Social Attitudes Survey (Jowell, Curtice, Park, \nBrook, Thomson and Bryson 1997) that contains the necessary measures of all key \nvariables.5 The dependent variable is an additive scale comprising four five-point Likert items \n(Cronbach\u2019s Alpha = 0.53) 6 that measure a general attitude toward science and the benefits \nof technological innovation. These questions have been included in a number of previous \nsurveys and have been used to create a measure of general attitude toward science in a \nnumber of studies (Bauer, Durant and Evans 1994, Evans and Durant 1995, Miller, Pardo \nand Niwa 1997, Pardo and Calvo 2002). Exact wordings for these items are provided in the \nappendix.  Raw scores on the summed scale have a possible range of zero to sixteen as the \nindividual items were all coded zero (least favourable) to four (most favourable). To facilitate \ninterpretation and comparability with the other key variables in the analysis, the raw scores \nwere converted into percentiles, representing the percentage of respondents at each value of \nthe raw scale. Respondents at a particular level of the scale were assigned the mid-point of \nthe set of percentiles covered by that particular value. Thus, for example, 0.2 per cent of \nrespondents had the lowest score on the raw summed scale. These respondents were \nassigned a percentile score of 0.001, representing the mid-point of this set of percentiles on \na zero to one scale. Higher scores on this scale therefore indicate a more favourable attitude \ntoward science.  A histogram of the raw scale score is presented in the appendix. \nAs a measure of scientific knowledge we use a ten-item subset of the scale originally \ndeveloped by Durant, Evans and Thomas (1989) that subsequently became known as the \n\u2018Oxford\u2019 scale of scientific knowledge. The subscale used here (range = 0-10) taps a range of \nareas of scientific knowledge (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha = 0.68). These include; understanding of \nprobability theory; understanding of the nature of scientific enquiry; understanding of \nexperimental design and control groups; and a number of areas of \u2018textbook\u2019 scientific \nknowledge. Raw scale scores were also converted to a percentile measure as outlined \n \n \n \n \n15\nabove. Exact wordings for these items and details of codings of correct\/incorrect responses \nare provided in the appendix.  \nFor our measure of political knowledge, we use a six-item scale tapping respondent \nknowledge of the policy stances of the main political parties in Great Britain (Cronbach\u2019s \nAlpha = 0.66). Raw scores ranged from zero to six and were also converted to a percentile \nmeasure to ease interpretation and comparability. Exact wordings and coding schemes are \nprovided in the appendix.  \n \nRESULTS \nTable 1 shows the results of three OLS regression models predicting general attitude \ntoward science. Predictors in the models are political affiliation; age; sex; religiosity; social \nclass; scientific qualifications; general educational attainment; marital status; and \nemployment status. Political knowledge, scientific knowledge and their interaction are \nincorporated in the models in iterative steps. The results of Model 1 clearly support H1, with \na positive and highly significant coefficient of 0.286 (p<0.001) for scientific knowledge, even \nin the presence of other important determinants of general attitude toward science. Note also \nthat the majority of other independent variables in the model are significant at the p < 0.05 \nlevel or lower and in the expected direction \u2013 being male, younger, non-religious, right wing, \nhaving scientific qualifications and being in a non-manual social-class are all positively \nassociated with a more favourable attitude toward science. \nModel 2 incorporates all the independent variables in Model 1 but this time adds \npolitical knowledge as a predictor in the model. The significant and positive main effect of \npolitical knowledge does not support H2 but in fact shows that the opposite of H2 pertains \u2013 \ngreater levels of political knowledge also lead to a more favourable attitude toward science. \nThis finding would appear to be at odds with the contextualist perspective. For the \ncontextualist critique of the deficit model argues that it provides an overly simple, holistic \n 16\naccount of the knowledge-attitude relationship and that considering other domains of \nknowledge such as \u2018institutional knowledge of science\u2019 as determinants of attitude would \nshow a reversal of the positive association commonly found between \u2018textbook\u2019 scientific \nknowledge and attitude toward science.  \n \nTABLE 1 HERE \n \nOur interpretation here depends crucially, of course, on acceptance of the political \nknowledge measure acting as a reasonable proxy for the \u2018institutional knowledge of science\u2019 \ndomain described by contextualist accounts \u2013 a point which we consider at greater length \nbelow. Note also that the R2 increases significantly and that the coefficients for the other \nindependent variables are not much affected as a result of the inclusion of political \nknowledge in the model. The biggest change is in the negative coefficient for sex (female) \nindicating that at least some of the negative attitude toward science amongst women may be \ndue to the difference in levels of political knowledge between the sexes. \nModel 3 further elaborates on Models 1 and 2 by including the interaction of political \nand scientific knowledge as an additional predictor of attitude toward science. What the \nsignificant interaction parameter in Model 3 shows then, is that there is indeed a \ncontextualising or moderating effect of political knowledge on the relationship between \ntextbook scientific knowledge and attitude toward science, supporting hypothesis H3. \nSomeone with the lowest level of political knowledge (zero) and the lowest level of scientific \nknowledge (zero) would have a predicted score of .49 (the intercept) on the attitude toward \nscience variable (that is to say they would be on the 49th percentile of the attitude variable). If \nsomeone has the lowest score on the political knowledge measure, a one unit increase in \nscientific knowledge would lead to a .18 increase in attitude toward science. If someone has \nthe lowest score on the scientific knowledge score, however, a one unit increase in political \nknowledge would lead to only a .008 increase in attitude toward science. The positive \n \n \n \n \n17\ncoefficient for the interaction of political and scientific knowledge indicates that, for every one \nunit increase in political knowledge, the slope of attitude toward science on scientific \nknowledge increases by 0.16 or, equivalently, for every one unit increase in scientific \nknowledge, the slope of attitude toward science on political knowledge increases by 0.16. \nThus, at all levels of scientific knowledge, the effect of growth in political knowledge is to \nfurther enhance the already favourable attitude. This is counter to what the contextualist \nmodel would predict as specified in hypothesis H3b. The same \u2018amplification\u2019 effect applies \nequally to scientific knowledge, which maintains a positive slope on attitude toward science \nat all levels of political knowledge - with the largest coefficients appearing at higher levels of \npolitical knowledge.  \nThe nature of this interacting effect between political and scientific knowledge on \nattitude toward science can be represented in three dimensional space by taking the \npredicted score on the attitude dependent variable from Model 3 at each combination of \nlevels of the other two variables as shown in Figure 1.7 Figure 1 clearly illustrates the \ncurvilinear relationship between each knowledge domain and attitude toward science. Note \nhow the regression plane always moves in an upward direction on the Z axis with increases \nin scientific or political knowledge. The group most favourable toward science are those at \nthe top percentile of both knowledge dimensions, while the least favourable are those with \nthe lowest score on political knowledge and the minimum on the scientific knowledge scales. \nFor those at the highest level of political knowledge, moving from the bottom to the top of the \nscientific knowledge scale alone results in a increase in favourability of attitude toward \nscience of almost thirty percentiles. This compares with a more modest jump of around \nseventeen percentiles for the same increase in scientific knowledge amongst those at the \nlowest level of political knowledge \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n 18\n \nThis then appears to be the reverse of what the contextualist account would lead us \nto expect \u2013 rather than political knowledge acting to attenuate the positive effect of \u2018textbook\u2019 \nscientific knowledge on attitude toward science, it actually appears to amplify the existing \npositive association. Furthermore, of the two domains, scientific knowledge appears to be far \nthe stronger determinant of attitude toward science. The largest increase in favourability of \nattitude caused by increasing political knowledge is 14 per cent while the equivalent figure for \nscientific knowledge is more than double that amount. This can be seen from the fact that the \nangle of elevation of the regression plane in Figure 1 is more oblique from left  to right than it \nis from front to back. \n \nDISCUSSION \nWe have tried in this paper to show how the contextualist and deficit perspectives in public \nunderstanding of science might be integrated within a survey-based quantitative analysis. In \ndoing so we hope to open up a more open and fruitful dialogue between researchers in the \nfield who come, perhaps, from different methodological and epistemological research \ntraditions. Too often methodological formalism and theoretical orthodoxy seems to prevent \nthe useful cross-fertilisation of ideas and stifles the progression and refinement of theory. To \nbe sure, we recognise that there are a number of problems and limitations in our approach \nand do not claim that the conclusions we draw concerning the complex relationship between \ndifferent domains of knowledge and attitude toward science are definitive. Nonetheless, \nmany of the caveats we ourselves would place on these results derive from circumstances \nbeyond our control; we have had, for example, to rely on analysis of secondary data and, to \nthat extent, have not been able to develop our own operationalisations of key constructs in \nour theoretical models. For this reason we hope that readers will see this analysis as a \nposition piece to be elaborated and improved upon in the future.  \n \n \n \n \n19\nWe anticipate two primary lines of objection to our analysis and the conclusions we \nhave drawn from it. To those who contend that these sorts of questions are simply not \namenable to a quantitative, survey-based approach, we have little to say in reply8. It is not \nthe aim of this paper to counter a generalised scepticism of the survey method (indeed any \nsceptics reading this paper are more likely to have had their prejudices confirmed) but to \nshow how these two important theoretical perspectives might be integrated within a single \nmethodological study. More forceful criticism will concern the operationalisations of our key \ntheoretical constructs: \u2018general attitude toward science\u2019, \u2018textbook knowledge of science\u2019 and \n\u2018institutional knowledge of science\u2019, to which we turn below. \nWe are aware that the use of such a generalised measure of attitude toward science \nraises issues of the exact meaning of such an abstract construct and whether our results \ncan, in any way, be expected to apply to more concrete and localised contexts. One does, of \ncourse, need to be extremely careful when interpreting general attitudes and their \nrelationship to more specific opinions and behaviours (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980).  \nNevertheless, we believe that an overall evaluation of science as measured here is \ndiagnostic of a wider set of attitudes, values and beliefs reflecting a person\u2019s disposition \ntowards the social integration of technological innovation and \u2018scientific progress\u2019 and concur \nwith Evans and Durant who argue that such a construct has real social force and meaning in \nthat it represents evaluations of science as \u201ca set of principles, a way of understanding the \nworld, or as a profession\u2019 (Evans and Durant 1995).  \nAs regards our measures of scientific and political knowledge, we accept that \nknowing the answers to these items in isolation cannot be conceived of as very interesting or \nuseful for understanding someone\u2019s attitude toward science in society.  How can knowledge \nor ignorance of a set of true\/false questions in a survey tell us anything of any value about \nsomeone\u2019s real understanding of science or politics? This line of criticism, however, \nfundamentally misses the point of measurement using diagnostic indicators. For, as we have \n 20\nalready pointed out, there is good evidence to suggest that people do not tend to learn things \nin isolation (Evans and Durant 1995, Gaziano and Gaziano 1996, Miller 1983, Miller 1998, \nPopkin and Dimock 1999, Tichenor, Donohue and Olien 1970).  It is likely, for example, that \na person who obtains a high score on this particular science quiz also has a range of other \nrelevant scientific knowledge and understanding that, taken together, influence the formation \nof their attitude toward science. Confusing the contents of the measurement instrument with \nthe attitude or trait underlying responses to it is a common mistake among critics of \nquantitative approaches to PUS. But, as Philip Converse has remarked, \u2018it does not take \nmuch imagination to realise that knowledge of minor facts\u2026are diagnostic of more profound \ndifferences in the amount of contextual information citizens bring to their judgments\u2019 \n(Converse 2000). The items selected for this analysis should accordingly be seen as \ndiagnostic indicators rather than fully constitutive of the actual scientific and political \nknowledge relevant to attitude formation.    \nOne need not disagree with our position here, however, to argue that our measure of \npolitical knowledge is not tapping the kind of awareness of \u2018patronage, organisation and \ncontrol\u2019 that is stressed within the contextualist treatment of \u2018institutional knowledge of \nscience\u2019. While acknowledging the need for further work and replication for delineating the \nmeasurement properties of this construct, we believe that we have summoned ample \nevidence pointing to the validity and reliability of such measures in general. And, furthermore, \nthere is no particular reason why awareness of science and technology policy and regulation \nshould not be among the other political issues, knowledge of which is known to correlate with \nthese sorts of items. Finally, if it could be shown that the type of policy related political \nknowledge that we have used here has, in fact, little to do with the type of \u2018institutional-\nrelational\u2019 knowledge that we are attempting to tap, it begs the question of why this type of \npolitical knowledge is related to the formation of attitudes towards science in the way we \nhave shown it to be. \n \n \n \n \n \n21\nCONCLUSION \nThe results as they stand lend some support to the contextualist perspective, \nalthough not perhaps in the way we might have expected. The effect of scientific knowledge \non attitude toward science is not a straightforward linear main effect, but does indeed appear \nto be \u2018contextualised\u2019 by at least one other domain of knowledge. This domain, we have \nargued, is that which Wynne (1992) has described as representing an individual\u2019s \nunderstanding of the \u2018patronage, organisation and control\u2019 operating in and around science \nand the scientific community. Contrary to what the contextualist critique of the deficit model \nwould lead us to expect, however, the effect of this knowledge domain seems to operate in \nways similar to \u2018textbook\u2019 scientific knowledge, augmenting the already positive influence of \nthe latter domain on favourability of attitude toward science. This latter result leads us to \nsuggest a possible mechanism underlying these findings.    \nPopkin and Dimock (1999) observe that respondents with low levels of political \nknowledge tend to see political scandal as much more serious than those with higher levels \nof political knowledge and understanding. They use Attribution Theory and, in particular, the \nnotion of the \u2018Fundamental Attribution Error\u2019 (Jones and Nisbett 1971) to explain why this \nmight be so. Attribution research has shown that people tend to interpret the behaviour of \nothers as indicative of character, while tending to attribute their own behaviour to \ncircumstances (Watson 1982). In other words, if a Member of Parliament writes a bounced \ncheque it is because she is untrustworthy; if I write a bounced cheque it is because I was so \nbusy that I forgot to first make sure I had sufficient funds. Furthermore, because we also tend \nto overestimate the reasonableness of our own actions, we also overestimate the probability \nthat others would do the same as us.  When this is not the case, we tend to attribute the \ndifference to \u2018bad character\u2019 (Ross and Anderson 1982).  Because a key moderating factor in \nthe tendency to make internal attributions is the amount of contextual information available to \nobservers, Popkin and Dimock argue that those with more political knowledge better \n 22\nunderstand the constraints and contexts in which political behaviour takes place. The more \nsituations and contexts in which one has observed these actions, the less likely it is that \nbehaviour will be attributed to character.   \nThis, of course, is entering the realms of post-hoc speculation but has, we feel, \nimportant implications for the interpretation of the findings that we have presented in this \npaper, in addition to highlighting a promising avenue for future research.  The effect of \nscientific knowledge on the attitudes of respondents whose knowledge of politics is high is \ngreater than it is for those with low political knowledge.  With a greater degree of political \nunderstanding and awareness, it may be that people are less likely to attribute the less \nfortunate outcomes of scientific development to the bad character of scientists or politicians \nbut to a more complex set of institutional, political and other \u2018situational\u2019 factors.  Hence, \nwhatever leads knowledge of science to increase one\u2019s favourability towards it, is even more \neffective when people are familiar with the complex range of circumstances surrounding \nscientific and technological development within the wider political landscape.  \nIn making these observations we are convinced that, firstly, both deficit and \ncontextualist perspectives help to explain how, why and under what conditions knowledge of \nmany kinds is important in determining public attitudes towards science and, secondly, that \nsurvey-based approaches are by no means unsuitable for research into public understanding \nof science from a \u2018contextualist\u2019 theoretical perspective.   \n \n \nNotes \n1 An earlier version of this article was presented at the World Association of Public Opinion \nResearch (WAPOR) Annual Conference, Date, Rome, Italy. \n2 We use this term to denote this perspective because, in this view, knowledge of science is \nseen not as an abstract canon of \u2018facts\u2019 but as sets of understandings within varying practical \nand social contexts. The effect of one form of understanding on attitude will, in this view, be \ncontextualised by other areas of knowledge. \n \n \n \n \n23\n3 We are here interpreting Einsiedel\u2019s use of \u2018interactive science model\u2019 as being equivalent \nor nearly equivalent to what we refer to as the contextualist perspective. \n4 The survey uses a multi-stage sampling design and is representative of the UK adult \npopulation. It was carried out by Social and Community Planning Research and achieved an \noverall response rate of 65 per cent. \n5 While this coefficient is well below the traditional cut-off criterion for scale reliability of 0.7, \nmore sophisticated scale assessment using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)  suggests a \none factor model fits the data extremely well  (X2 = 0.2; df = 1; p= 0.647), with all 4 indicators \ncontributing significantly (p < 0.001) to the common factor variance. \n6 The predicted scores assume values of zero on all other independent variables in the \nmodel. \n7 However, we point such readers in the direction of King, Keohane and Verba (1994) and \nGoldthorpe (2000) for excellent expositions in this regard. \n8 They include as \u2018knowledge\u2019 items, statements such as \u2018The reward of scientific research is \nrecognition rather than money\u2019 and \u2018For the industrialized countries investment in science is \na top priority\u2019 which we consider express unverifiable beliefs that are more indicative of \nattitudes.\n 24\n \nBibliography \n \nI.

The effect of one form of understanding on attitude will, in this view, be \ncontextualised by other areas of knowledge. \n3 We are here interpreting Einsiedel\u2019s use of \u2018interactive science model\u2019 as being equivalent \nor nearly equivalent to what we refer to as the contextualist perspective. \n4 They include as \u2018knowledge\u2019 items, statements such as \u2018The reward of scientific research is \nrecognition rather than money\u2019 and \u2018For the industrialized countries investment in science is \na top priority\u2019 which we consider express unverifiable beliefs that are more indicative of \nattitudes. \n5 The survey uses a multi-stage sampling design and is representative of the UK adult \npopulation. It was carried out by Social and Community Planning Research and achieved an \noverall response rate of 65 per cent. \n6 While this coefficient is well below the traditional cut-off criterion for scale reliability of 0.7, \nmore sophisticated scale assessment using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)  suggests a \none factor model fits the data extremely well  (X2 = 0.2; df = 1; p= 0.647), with all 4 indicators \ncontributing significantly (p < 0.001) to the common factor variance. \n7 The predicted scores assume values of zero on all other independent variables in the \nmodel. \n8 However, we point such readers in the direction of King, Keohane and Verba (1994) and \nGoldthorpe (2000) for excellent expositions in this regard. \n"}
