These include\nthe integration of information and communication technology systems to assist in the teaching\nof a given higher-education curriculum. A number of papers address the questions which are\non all our lips, such as: How, when and where should we embark on such a teaching exercise\nand, perhaps more importantly, at what cost? Ryan et al, Zhao et al and Lavelle offer useful\ninsights into the setting up of computer-based resources for the teaching of economics, design\nand contract law, while Mozzon-McPherson's study demonstrates how Internet resources can\nenhance the process of language learning. However, an interesting finding from many of the\nteaching experiments is that in spite of students' enthusiasm for these new teaching\ntechnologies, they do not wish to see the traditional lecture totally replaced by computer-\nlearning sessions. Students recognize the advantages of working at their own pace, but still feel\nmore comfortable with the tried and trusted lecture. They do not want to be distanced from\ntheir tutors, and the students from the study by Ryan et al suggested that their CBL sessions\nshould in future be supervised by subject specialists.\nHarding et al warn that the introduction of computer-based learning materials should be\nconsidered as an 'add-on cost' to course production, and that the benefits of using such\nmaterials should be seen more in terms of an 'enhancement of education rather than a\nreplacement of older methods'. This opinion is substantiated by Allinson who suggests that the\napplication of 'comprehensive multimedia implementations for the teaching of practical social\npsychology skills can be viewed as an augmentation of traditional methods and not merely an\nimposed substitute'.\nHow to promote and support the appropriate use of technology in teaching and learning was\nthe remit of the Education Technology Service of the University of Bristol, and Longstaffe et\nal describe the activities of such a working support-service, while Harding et al argue for the\nimplementation of a simple courseware-management system if co-operative cross-platform\ncourseware development is to be sustained.\nAnother question which is prompted by this set of papers is: How can we evaluate our\n3\nDen\/se Whitelock Editorial\ncomputer-based learning systems once we have built them? The formative evaluation carried\n o\nout by Tosunoglu et al included a number of different measures. They utilized pre- to post-test\nchange scores to assess learning gains, and also conducted a series of interviews supported by\na number of questionnaires to gain insight into the subject attitudes towards the software.\nGordon and Garrud employed an array of evaluation techniques including pre- and post-tests,\nrandomized trials, and cohort comparisons. The summative evaluation of Pollock et al of their\nfirst-year mathematics CAL course for the BTechEd students shows that students' examination\nresults were on a par with the previous year which was taught by traditional methods. A\ncombination of formative and summative evaluations are advocated to understand the benefits\nof computer-based learning systems.\nA further theme which emanates from these papers is the role of information and\ncommunication technologies for distance learners. The study by Whitelock et al forms part of\nan ongoing research programme to investigate students working with a computer at a distance\nwith audio only, and then video links. Their work suggests that rather than being an inferior\nsubstitute to working side by side, it seems that the audio condition has some advantages.\nWilson and Whitelock's paper emphasizes the importance of minimizing information overload\nfor both tutors and students (a computer-conferencing system is being used to teach a computer\nscience course to distance learners), while Kirkwood et al examine the organizational and\npedagogical changes that may ensue with the more extensive use of IT.\nOne issue that was only touched upon was the use of IT to promote collaborative learning. We\nknow that IT can provide an environment that supports group work, and finding ways to\ninvestigate laboratory results into curriculum packages presents us with future challenges.\nDenise Whitelock, The Open University\n4\n"}
