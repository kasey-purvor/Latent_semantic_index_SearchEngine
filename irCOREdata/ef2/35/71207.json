Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; electric\nfields and currents) \u00e1 Magnetospheric physics\n(magnetosphere\u2013ionosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nOmega bands are a distinct class of auroral form that\ngenerally occur in the morning sector during the\nrecovery phase of magnetospheric substorm (Akasofu,\n1974; Saito, 1978; Rostoker and Barichello, 1980). They\nare characterised by bright regions extending from the\npoleward boundary of the aurora separated by a dark\nregion that loosely resembles an inverted Greek letter X.\nIn many cases the bright protruding regions, originally\ndescribed as \u2018\u2018torches\u2019\u2019 by Akasofu and Kimball (1963),\nalso resemble the letter X and the term \u2018\u2018omega band\u2019\u2019 is\nused to describe auroral features with either character-\nistic. Omega bands have been observed to propagate in\nthe eastward direction at velocities ~1 km s)1 (Lu\u00a8hr and\nSchlegel, 1994) and have also been observed in both\nhemispheres simultaneously (Mravlag et al., 1991). As\nthey travel eastward the spatial structure of omega\nbands remains relatively unchanged and observations of\nomega bands are usually accompanied by azimuthal\ncomponent magnetic disturbances. Studies by various\nauthors (Saito, 1978; Kawasaki and Rostoker, 1979;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1983; Buchert et al., 1988) have\nconcluded that the observation of a Ps 6 pulsation\n(period ~4\u201340 min) implies the existence of an auroral\nomega band. In addition, previous authors have linked\nPs 6 pulsations to the propagation of vortical Hall\ncurrents associated with field-aligned currents (FACs)\n(e.g. Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994) although the mechanism\nby which these FACs arise is still uncertain.\nThe stable nature of the omega band structure\ncombined with rapid propagation in the azimuthal\ndirection implies that extended networks of magneto-\nmeter stations are particularly suitable for the study of\nthis phenomena. Equivalent currents calculated from\nground magnetometer stations reveal much information\nregarding the spatial extent of the auroral features and\nthe current systems contained within them.\nHigh frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF)\ncoherent scatter radars measure signals backscattered\no\u0080 magnetic field-aligned plasma irregularities. These\nprovide measurements of line-of-sight (l-o-s) ionospheric\nconvection velocities fromwhich estimates of ionospheric\nelectric fields can be derived over a very large field-of-\nview at relatively high temporal resolution (see Sect. 2).\nCorrespondence to: J. A. Wild\nE-mail: jaw11@ion.le.ac.uk\nAnn. Geophysicae 18, 99\u2013110 (2000) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 2000\nFurthermore, by combining the ionospheric electric field\nstrength inferred from radar observations and magnetic\nfield measurements from ground magnetometers within\nthe radar field-of-view it is possible to make estimates of\nthe ionospheric Hall conductance at several points\ninside the region of interest. Whilst this technique does\nnot readily yield absolute measurements of conductance\nsuch as those obtained using incoherent scatter radars\n(e.g. Buchert et al., 1988), the estimates can be made\nover a greatly extended area when compared with the\nincoherent scatter approach. The resulting distribution\nof high and low conductance contributes further to the\nunderstanding of omega band structure and electrody-\nnamics.\nIn this work, we present observations of an interval\nof intense Ps 6 pulsations with the Co-operative UK\nTwin Located Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS)\nFinland HF radar, the Scandinavian Twin Auroral\nRadar Experiment (STARE) Norway VHF radar and\nelements of the Greenland coastal and International\nMonitor for Auroral Geomagnetic E\u0080ects (IMAGE)\nmagnetometer networks. The simultaneous multi-instru-\nment observations allow us to deduce a two-dimensional\ndescription of the omega bands in terms of magnetic\nperturbations, FACs, ionospheric electric fields, Hall\nconductances and equivalent currents. Finally, various\nproposed formation mechanisms are considered and the\nrelationship between omega bands and the substorm\nphases are discussed.\n2 Instrumentation\nCUTLASS (Fig. 1) is a bi-static HF coherent radar, with\nstations in Finland and Iceland and forms part of the\ninternational SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar\nNetwork) chain of HF radars (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nEach radar of the system is frequency agile (8\u201320 MHz),\nroutinely measuring the line-of-sight (l-o-s) Doppler\nvelocity and spectral width of, and the backscattered\npower from, ionospheric plasma irregularities. The\nradars form 16 beams of separation 3.24\u00b0. Each beam\nis gated into 75 range bins, each of length 45 km in\nstandard operations. During standard operations the\ndwell time for each beam is either 7 or 3 s, giving a full\n16-beam scan, covering 52\u00b0 in azimuth and over 3000 km\nin range (an area of over 3 \u0002 106 km2), every 120 or 60 s.\nCommon volume data from the two stations can be\ncombined to provide E and F-region ionospheric con-\nvection velocities perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nThe l-o-s ionospheric convection velocities used in this\nstudy were measured by the CUTLASS Finland radar\nlocated at Hankasalmi (62.3\u00b0N, 26.6\u00b0E), Finland be-\ntween 01:30\u201303:30 UT on 11 May 1998. During this\ninterval the radar was operating in a non-standard scan\nmode.

This allows\nthe construction of full 16-beam scans at a reduced\ntemporal resolution of 4 min, in addition to the\nprovision of high time resolution data (~14 s) along a\nsingle look direction (in this case beam 9, a beam which\napproximately overlies the main meridional chain of the\nIMAGE array). The second radar of the CUTLASS pair,\nlocated at Pykkvib\u00e6r (63.8\u00b0N, 20.3\u00b0W), Iceland was\noperating in a similar mode during this interval provid-\ning one high time resolution beam in addition to reduced\ntemporal resolution scans of the entire field-of-view.\nAlthough backscattered power from approximately 8\u00b0 of\nmagnetic latitude over a period of a least 5 hours was\nobserved by the Finland radar, no significant backscatter\nwas observed in the same region by the Iceland radar\nduring this interval.\nThe STARE system (Greenwald et al., 1978) com-\nprises two coherent VHF radars located at Midtsandan\n(63.4\u00b0N, 10.7\u00b0E), Norway and Hankasalmi (62.3\u00b0N,\n26.6\u00b0E), Finland operating at 140.0 MHz and\n143.8 MHz respectively. Each radar forms 8 beams of\nseparation 3.6\u00b0 and each beam is gated into 50 range\ngates, each of length 15 km with a range to first gate of\n495 km. The beams of all CUTLASS and STARE\nradars are numbered in clockwise direction (0\u20137 in the\ncase of STARE, 0\u201315 for CUTLASS), however in\ncontrast to the CUTLASS radars which cycles through\nbeams sequentially to construct a scanof the field-of-view,\nthe STARE radars scan all 8 beams simultaneously,\n\u2018\u2018floodlighting\u2019\u2019 the entire field-of-view over a 20 s\nintegration time. Each radar routinely measures\nE-region backscattered power and irregularity l-o-s\nphase velocity and by combining velocity measurements\nfrom the overlapping region of the two fields of view\n(~2.3 \u0002 105 km2) it is possible to derive E-region iono-\nspheric flow velocities perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield. Once again, during this interval significant\nbackscattered power was measured at one radar only\n(Norway).\nFig. 1.

Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands\nThe majority of magnetic field observations are\nobtained from stations belonging to two arrays, the\nGreenland west coast magnetometer chain (details of the\ninstrumentation and a description of the observatories\nhave been given by Wilhjelm and Friis-Christensen,\n1976) and the IMAGE magnetometer network (Lu\u00a8hr,\n1994). Data from the Jan Mayen magnetometer de-\nployed by the Troms\u00f8 Auroral Observatory have also\nbeen employed. All magnetic observations have been\nmade by fluxgate magnetometers and data have been\npresented in a common co-ordinate system where X, Y\nand Z components have directions geographic north,\ngeographic east and vertically downwards respectively.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Ground magnetometer response\nFigure 2 presents the X and Y components of the local\nmagnetic field measured at several stations of the\nIMAGE magnetometer array and the Jan Mayen\n(JAN) magnetometer of the Troms\u00f8 Auroral Observa-\ntory. These elements of the IMAGE array are located at\nmagnetic local times approximated by MLT \u0019 UT\u0087 2\nand Jan Mayen is located at MLT \u0019 UT\u0087 1. Beginning\nat approximately 01:50 UT, a series of at least five Ps 6\nwave-cycles with periods of approximately 18 min are\nclear in the Y component magnetograms from the SOR,\nTRO, AND and KIL stations. Less intense pulsations\nare also observed at BJN. Oscillations of comparable\nmagnitudes and periods are also apparent in the X\ncomponent measured at all of the IMAGE stations\nshown. These pulsations are not observed at JAN\nalthough both X and Y components are disturbed\nthroughout the interval. At stations where the pulsa-\ntions are most pronounced (e.g. TRO) the first positive\ndeviation in the Y component is significantly smaller\nthan during later pulsations. Subsequently, the Y-\ncomponent oscillations lead the X component oscilla-\ntions in phase (Y component becomes more positive as\nthe X component becomes more negative and vice-\nversa). The maximum amplitude of the Y component\noscillations at TRO occurs at around 02:20 UT with a\npeak to peak value ~150 nT. The delay between each\npulsation being observed at SOR after being observed at\nAND suggest that the structures are propagating in an\neastward direction over the Scandinavian sector with a\nmean velocity ~0.75 km s)1. Furthermore, comparing\nthe Ps 6 pulsation train at SOR and AND at geographic\nlongitudes of 22.22\u00b0 and 16.03\u00b0 respectively, it is clear\nthat ionospheric structures that gives rise to the\nFig. 2a, b.

X component\ndata have been filtered between 200 and 20 s in order to\nstudy Pi2 pulsations (SKT only shown) and provide a\nreference time for the substorm onsets (Rostoker et al.,\n1980) and these are indicated in the figure by vertical\nlines. In addition, the majority of IMAGE magnetome-\nters observed a significant substorm onset\/intensification\nat 23:30 UT on the previous day (10 May, 1998 not\nshown).\n3.2 Radar measurements of ionospheric convection\nThe line-of-sight (l-o-s) ionospheric convection velocities\nobserved by the STARE Norway and CUTLASS\nFinland radars between 01:30\u201303:30 UT on 11 May,\n1998, are presented in Fig. 4. Prior to 01:50 UT a\nbackground flow with poleward component\n\u0014 120 m s)1 was observed between magnetic latitudes\n65\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 by the CUTLASS radar (Fig. 4a). AT ~01:53\nUT a region of intense poleward flow ~600 m s)1\ndeveloped at ~71\u00b0 magnetic latitude and drifted ~2\u00b0\npoleward over the following 5 min. This is immediately\nfollowed by a region of equatorward flow of velocity\n~240 m s)1 propagating polewards over a similar time\nscale and latitudinal extent. Beginning at 02:00 UT, a\nregion of poleward flow ~600 m s)1 is observed over\napproximately 1.5\u00b0 of magnetic latitude with the equa-\ntorward boundary located at ~68\u00b0. This region was\nobserved to move in a poleward direction at a rate of\napproximately 3\u00b0 in 10 min and was again followed by a\nregion of weaker (~240 m s)1) equatorward flow. Re-\ngions of comparable strong poleward then weak equa-\ntorward flow, always propagating away from the radar\nare then observed with a repetition period ~18 min. At\nleast five such structures are clear during the interval\nand are marked by vertical lines at (\u008b1 min): 02:00,\n02:18, 02:36, 02:53, and 03:10 UT. In many cases a\nperiod during which no backscattered signal is observed\noccurs immediately after the region of enhanced flow\nhas reached its most poleward location (e.g. 02:25\u2013\n02:40, magnetic latitudes 70\u00b0\u201374\u00b0). By studying the\nelevation angle of received backscattered signal sur-\nrounding these regions, they have been determined to\ncorrespond the ionospheric F-region. It is likely that the\nregions of reduced backscatter correspond to regions of\nvery low electric field and high conductance within the\nluminous tongue of the omega band. This would lead to\nthe quenching of any electron density irregularities in\nthese regions and thus the removal of the targets\nnecessary for radar backscatter. The conductances in\nthese regions are examined further in later sections.\nE-region l-o-s velocities measured by the STARE\nNorway radar (Fig. 4b) indicate a generally elevated\npoleward component of the background flow\n(~600 m s)1) in the highest latitude region of backscatter\nobserved by this radar (~69\u00b0) when compared to\nF-region l-o-s velocities measured by CUTLASS at the\nsame latitudes. Superimposed upon this background are\nregions of enhanced poleward flow extending equator-\nward as far as ~66\u00b0, each interval lasting ~10 min and\nwith a repetition period ~18 min. These occur at\n(\u008b1 min): 01:54, 02:13, 02:32, 02:48, and 03:04 UT\nand are again indicated by vertical lines. The regions of\nreduced backscatter observed by CUTLASS at magnetic\nlatitudes \u001570\u000e are not apparent in the STARE radar\ndata as the field-of-view does not extend to such high\nFig. 3.

Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands 103\n3.3 Derived equivalent current features\nFor some time omega bands have been associated with\nthe ionospheric Hall current vortices that arise as a\nresult of FACs (Opgenoorth et al., 1983; Buchert et al.,\n1988; Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994). In order to visualise the\ncurrent structure associated with the Ps 6 pulsations\n(and hence the omega bands) presented here, a sequence\nof equivalent current vectors are derived from 3\nmagnetometers of the IMAGE chain (Fig. 5). For an\nE-region current system with a spatial extent of greater\nthan the E-region height, and assuming a horizontally\nuniform ionospheric conductivity, then the ground\nmagnetic field deflections, b, can be related to an\nionospheric equivalent current density, J, by\nJx \u0088 \u00ff 2l0\nby Jy \u0088 2l0\nbx ; \u00851\u0086\nwhere x and y indicate the northward and eastward\ncomponents respectively (Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994).\nSince the omega bands appear to move eastward,\naccording to the observed propagation delay in the\nmagnetometer data, the current vectors have to be\nplotted against an inverted time scale to give a correct\nimage of the spatial current distribution (see e.g. Lu\u00a8hr\nand Schlegel, 1994). So that direct comparisons can be\nmade between the current distributions at various\nlatitudes, time o\u0080sets appropriate for the propagation\ndelay between each longitudinally separated station\nhave been incorporated (180 and 350 s for TRO and\nAND respectively). These o\u0080sets are consistent with the\ntime taken for each omega band to travel longitudinally\nbetween the observing magnetometer and beam 9 of the\nCUTCLASS radar at the speed calculated in Sect. 3.1.\nDuring the interval presented at least five pairs of\nvortices are observed. Each pair of vortices is associated\nwith a region of upward and a region of downward FAC\nwhere each FAC generates a Hall current of anticlock-\nwise and clockwise sense respectively, characteristic\nfeatures of auroral omega bands. As the series of\ncurrent pairs propagate eastward over the magnetome-\nters, the measured equivalent current vectors rotate in a\nclockwise direction indicating that the current system is\nlocated poleward of SOR, TRO and AND. In the region\nbetween each upward\/downward FAC pair, the equiv-\nalent current will be directed in an approximately\nequatorward direction. From Fig. 5 the equivalent\ncurrent direction can be seen to achieve an equatorward\npointing direction (vertically downward in figure) at the\nfollowing time (\u008b1 min): 02:04, 02:20, 02:38, 02:55, and\n03:08 UT. Equivalent currents derived at BJN (not\nshown) rotate in an anticlockwise direction over a near-\nidentical timeframe implying that the observed current\nsystem is located equatorward of that station, i.e. in the\nregion between SOR and BJN. It is just this region that\nis contained within the fields of view of the CUTLASS\nand STARE radars.\n3.4 Derived ionospheric Hall conductances\nIt is possible to more closely examine the relationship\nbetween the magnetic field observed by the ground\nmagnetometers and ionospheric speed (which is related\nto one component of the horizontal electric field) by\ncombining the measured ionospheric velocities and the\nderived equivalent current intensity. As the equivalent\nHall currents JH are related to the ionospheric electric\nfield, E, and hence the plasma convection velocity, v, via\nthe height integrated Hall conductance,\nP\nH , by\nJH \u0088\nX\nH\nE \u0088\nX\nH\nvB \u00852\u0086\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, in the present\nexperimental arrangement an estimate of the Hall\nconductance may be estimated from (Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1993,\n1996).X\nH\n\u0019 \u00ff 2\nl0\nby\nvxB\n: \u00853\u0086\nThe l-o-s velocities measured by the radar are assumed\nto have been made along a near-meridional beam\ndirection implying\nFig. 5. Equivalent current patterns deduced from IMAGE magne-\ntometer data. The current vectors have been plotted against a reversed\ntime axis. This is appropriate for visualising eastward moving\nfeatures. The TRO and AND time series have been shifted by 180\nand 350 s respectively to account for the propagation delay between\nthose magnetometers and SOR\n104 J. A. Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands\nvl\u00ffo\u00ffs \u0019 vx \u00854\u0086\nand by is simply the component of the observed\nmagnetic field in the Y direction. In order to emphasise\nthe fluctuations in the ionospheric Hall conductances\nthat result from omega band passage over a given\nlocation, magnetic field data have been filtered between\n1200 and 300 seconds. The background magnetic field is\ndetermined by applying low pass filter (1200 s) to the\noriginal magnetic field data. This background field is\nthen added to the filtered data to provide a time-series of\nmagnetic field observations which although filtered, still\ncontains information regarding the background level of\nthe magnetic field. Finally, the absolute value of\nmagnetic field from the quiet period prior to the Ps 6\npulsations is subtracted from the resulting time series\ne\u0080ectively removing the quiet time and internal mag-\nnetic field variations. What remains is the magnetic field\ndue to the enhanced electrojet and omega band struc-\ntures. In the interests of consistency l-o-s velocity data\nhave been filtered similarly although there is no\nrequirement to subtract the background from these\nabsolute measurements. Figure 6 presents the parame-\nters used to calculate\nP\nH employing data from the SOR\nmagnetometer and CUTLASS Finland (beam 9, range\ngate 16). Magnetic field and l-o-s velocities are processed\nin the manner described (centre 2 panels) in Fig. 6.\nA suitable o\u0080set (75 s) has been added to the By time-\nseries to account for the slight longitudinal separation of\nSOR and the chosen range gate in the high-time\nresolution beam of the radar. The calculated Hall\nconductance is insensitive to the uncertainties in this\no\u0080set (\u008b20%) as this uncertainity is small compared to\nthe lifetime of each pulsation (~20 min). Equivalent\ncurrents derived from SOR and BJN are overlaid at\nappropriate latitudes on the range-time-velocity (RTV)\nplot (lower panel) Fig. 6. Finally, the calculated Hall\nconductance is presented (Fig. 6, top panel). All panels\nare plotted against a common reversed time scale in\norder to visualise the spatial structure of the omega\nbands.\nConductance time-series have been calculated for five\nmagnetometer\/radar pairs (three magnetometers within\nthe CUTLASS field-of-view, two within the STARE\nfield-of-view) and these are shown in Fig. 7. All CUT-\nLASS derived conductances contain o\u0080sets such that the\npresented profiles occur at positions within beam 9.\nSTARE derived conductances are calculated using l-o-s\nvelocities from range cells directly overlaying SOR and\nTRO.\nBeginning with the CUTLASS derived profiles\n(Fig. 7a), in both the TRO and SOR panels five\nsignificant peaks in the Hall conductance are clear.\nValues of conductance rapidly increase to values ~10\ntimes above the background level. As the technique\nemployed here to calculate Hall conductance is influ-\nenced greatly by the magnitude of the background\nmagnetic field it is very di\u0081cult to determine an absolute\nvalue of conductance. It is more appropriate to view the\npresented profiles as indicators of the variability of the\nionospheric Hall conductance due to the passage of\nauroral omega bands through the observation points.\nNonetheless sustained conductances of ~100 S are\nentirely reasonable, indeed Hall conductances up to\n~200 S have previously been associated with auroral\narcs by a number of authors (e.g. Buchert et al., 1988;\nLu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994; Aikio and Kaila, 1996). The\npeaks in conductance at SOR and TRO occur almost\nsimultaneously implying that at scales comparable to\nthe separation of these stations the spatial structure of\nthe omega bands is relatively uniform. By comparing the\nconductance with derived equivalent currents at both\nSOR and TRO it can be seen that the Hall conductance\nincreases to its maximum level between the observation\nof maximum poleward and maximum equatorward\nequivalent currents. This is consistent with the passage\nof an upward FAC slightly polewards of the point of\nobservation creating an anticlockwise vortical Hall\ncurrent (viewed from above) and a region of high\nconductance due to enhanced electron precipitation.\nAlthough the derived conductances at BJN are not as\nclearly defined as those at lower latitude stations a\nsequence of successive peaks and troughs are still\nidentifiable. In general, the maximum conductance value\nat BJN is substantially lower and is observed prior to\nthat at lower latitudes suggesting that the omega band\nstructure is not uniform at all the latitudes observed.\nMore precisely the \u2018\u2018leading\u2019\u2019 of more poleward obser-\nvations implies that the high conductance\/precipitation\nregion is not aligned in a meridional direction. Instead\nthe equatorward region lags behind the poleward by\nsome distance (~200 km in the longitudinal direction) as\nthe whole structure propagates eastwards.\nSimilar conductance signatures of multiple omega\nband passage are apparent in STARE derived conduc-\ntances (Fig. 7b). All five omega bands are clearly\ncontained within the STARE\/SOR observations. Within\nthe range gate overlaying TRO, no l-o-s velocity\nmeasurements were made after ~03:15 UT although\nfour significant conductance intensifications were ob-\nserved prior to this time. It should be noted that\nconductances calculated from the STARE beams select-\ned are a factor ~5 smaller than CUTLASS derived\nconductances. The selection of beams within the\nSTARE field-of-view that closely overlay SOR and\nTRO rather than the beam that is most closely aligned\nto a meridional direction implies that Eq. (4) is no\nlonger accurate as the l-o-s velocities will be contami-\nnated with the zonal component of the ionospheric flow.\nExamination of STARE beam 0 (azimuth ~13\u00b0) reveals\nthat l-o-s velocities in a near-meridional direction are ~4\ntimes smaller than those measured in beams 3 and 4.\nAlso, the poleward component of velocity, vx, measured\nby STARE is likely to be underestimated due to sound-\nspeed limiting e\u0080ects (Robinson, 1986). Furthermore,\nthe use of l-o-s velocities from multiple beams intro-\nduces a temporal o\u0080set between each beam\u2019s estimated\nconductance profile. It is therefore reasonable to assume\nthat the suppressed conductances and dispersed timings\ndeduced from STARE l-o-s velocities are artificially\ndistorted due to viewing angle geometry. Once the\nrelevant geometrical issues have been resolved, conduc-\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands 105\n106 J. A.

Never-\ntheless the location of regions of elevated Hall conduc-\ntance at SOR and TRO derived from both CUTLASS\nand STARE are approximately co-located.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Omega band structure\nThe observations and interpretation presented so far\nhave been employed to construct a schematic represen-\ntation of the structure of an auroral omega band\n(Fig. 8a). Measurements of ionospheric electric field,\nequivalent currents and derived conductances are com-\nbined to infer the optical and current structure of the\nomega band, associating high conductance with high\nauroral luminosity. In general the peak of conductance\nis located on the westward side of the enhanced\nconductance region that relates to the auroral projec-\ntion. Highly luminous, high conductance regions are\nassociated with upward FACs (Akasofu, 1981; Opgen-\noorth et al., 1983), which in this case are located near the\npoleward boundary of the auroral oval, and around\nwhich vortical Hall currents flow in an anticlockwise\nsense. These upward FACs occur further towards the\neast at higher latitudes as indicated by the o\u0080set of\nregions of high conductance at BJN and SOR as shown\nin Fig. 6. Outside the high conductance region, down-\nward FACs (associated with clockwise Hall currents)\nallow current closure through the ionosphere. The\nresulting equatorward current between the two Hall\ncurrent systems gives rise to the intense poleward flow\nobserved by the radars. This flow is then shifted to\nhigher latitudes by the distorted poleward boundary of\nthe auroral oval as the next omega band moves in from\nthe west. This region is clearly apparent as a diagonal\nFig. 6. Line-of-sight velocities from beam 9 of the CUTLASS\nFinland radar as a function of magnetic latitude and time (bottom\npanel). Equivalent current patterns deduced from SOR and BJN are\noverlaid at appropriate latitudes.

Estimated\nionospheric Hall conductances, derived from magnetometer and l-o-s\nvelocity data is displayed in the top panel (see text for description). All\npanels are plotted against a common reversed time axis in order to\ncorrectly visualise the spatial structure of eastward propagating\nfeatures\nb\nFig. 7. a Ionospheric Hall conductances derived from CUTLASS\nbeam 9, l-o-s velocities and IMAGE magnetometer data.

CUTLASS derived profiles are directly comparable\nas all l-o-s velocities are drawn from a single beam whereas STARE\nderived profiles represent simultaneous measurements from two\nseparate locations (see text for description).

Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands 107\nband of poleward flow in the reversed time scale range-\ntime-intensity plot in Fig. 6. Finally, just before the high\nconductance region reaches its maximum poleward\nextent, vortical Hall currents briefly drive a weak\nequatorward flow. The scale size of the entire omega\nband is ~500 km in the longitudinal direction and\n~600 km in the latitudinal direction. The eastward\npropagation velocity of the omega bands observed\nduring this interval is ~0.75 \u008b 0.1 km s)1. This view\nof omega band structure is consistent with that pro-\nposed by Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel (1994) and it could be\nconsidered that a refinement of that description is\nappropriate to the observations in this case study.\nAlthough the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar tech-\nnique used in that study allows the derivation of\nP\nH\ndirectly from observed ionospheric parameters (i.e. does\nnot require a radar\/magnetometer pair and the assump-\ntions required in their combination) the spatial extent of\nthe field-of-view is limited to one location. The multi-\npoint nature of the current study over a much larger\nfield-of-view, albeit with a less absolute method of\nconductance determination, yields further information\nregarding the morphology of omega bands.\n4.2 Omega band formation\nThe process by which omega bands are created is still\nunclear. Many authors have linked morning sector\nauroral omega bands with pairs of field-aligned currents\n(Opgenoorth et al., 1983; Buchert et al., 1988; Lu\u00a8hr and\nSchlegel, 1994) although the exact mechanism by which\nthese currents arise remains a subject for debate. The\ndistribution of FACs within the inferred bright region is\nnot consistent with the expected distribution if omega\nbands were to form as a result of the interchange\ninstability as proposed by Yamamoto et al. (1997). In\nthat case, upward FAC would be concentrated within\nthe bright region at the eastward boundary of each\nomega band and downward current just inside the\nwestward boundary. Despite the lack of optical obser-\nvations due to the unsuitable season of the interval\npresented, the asymmetrical distribution of omega band\nstructure presented here is entirely consistent with\noptical observations in previous studies (e.g. Snyder\nand Akasofu, 1974; Opgenoorth et al., 1994). These are\ncharacterised by a roughly X shaped distortion of the\nbright poleward boundary of the auroral oval, slightly\ndarker in the central region than at the edge and often\n\u2018\u2018leaning\u2019\u2019 slightly in the longitudinal direction.\nComplementary observations of the ultraviolet aurora\nroutinely made by the Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI)\ninstrument on-board the POLAR spacecraft (Torr et\nal., 1995) would have proven useful in characterising the\nspatial structure but these were also unavailable during\nthe interval presented here. The omega bands described\nhere are, however, consistent with the results of a\nKelvin-Helmholtz type instability near the poleward\nboundary of the auroral oval, the mechanism of\nformation being similar to that of auroral spirals or\nfolds as discussed by Hallinan (1976). In this case a\nvelocity shear would occur at the poleward boundary of\nthe auroral oval in the dawn convection cell where\nregion 1 (downward) and region 2 (upward) FACs lead\nto Hall currents (opposite in direction to the E\u0002 B\ndrifts) as discussed by Fuji et al. (1994) and as indicated\nin Fig. 8b. It is possible that the presented omega bands\nhave been generated by another instability process but\nthe exact determination of the generation mechanism\nwould require co-ordinated in-situ observations from\nspacecraft within the appropriate region of the magne-\ntosphere which are unavailable for this interval.\nOf particular interest is the relationship of omega\nbands in the morning sector to substorm phase. Gen-\nerally observed in the morning hours around 05:00 MLT\nfollowing substorm activity, it has long been assumed\nthat omega bands are a purely recovery phase phenom-\nenon (Akasofu, 1974; Saito, 1976; Rostoker and Baric-\nhello, 1980). The omega bands observed on the morning\nof 11 May, 1999, occurred during a sequence of\nsubstorm onset\/intensifications that began at 23:30 UT\nof the previous day (not shown) with subsequent onset\/\nintensifications at 00:43, 01:35, 01:50, and 03:05 UT\n(Fig. 3). The onset\/intensification of a substorm to the\nwest over Greenland at 01:50 UT and the almost\nsimultaneous observation (within minutes) of auroral\nomega bands in the morning sector suggests a more\nsubtle mechanism. The concurrent growth of a magne-\ntospheric substorm during the recovery phase of a\nprevious substorm and the link with auroral omega\nbands in the morning sector has been discussed previ-\nously by Pellinen et al. (1992). Conventional interpr-\netation suggests that the substorm recovery phase is an\ninterval during which the general level of magnetic\nFig. 8. a Schematic representation of auroral omega bands.

Wild et al.: Multi-instrument observations of the electric and magnetic field structure of omega bands\ndisturbance declines to some quiet level. It seems\nunlikely then that a system that is tending to a more\nquiescent state would spontaneously generate a series of\ninstabilities such as omega bands in the morning sector.\nA new substorm onset, acting upon an already disturbed\nsystem could intensify the dawn convection cell, already\nenergised by the previous substorm expansion, and thus\ncould have the ability to drive the large-scale downward\ncurrents at the poleward edge of the morning sector oval\nunstable, creating a series of filamentary FACs.\nA detailed study of IMAGE network X component\nmagnetograms reveals a sudden intensification of the\nnegative bay at 01:50 UT observed at many stations\nsimultaneously, regardless of longitudinal location. This\nis in contrast with subsequent observations of Ps 6\npulsations (omega bands) that follows shortly after-\nwards which are dispersed in longitude. This implies that\nthat the onset of the bay is a global response to the\nonset\/intensification (Opgenoorth and Pellinen, 1998)\nobserved at Greenland and the pulsations are due to\ndrifting omega bands that are formed after the new\nsubstorm onset. Furthermore, the absence of Ps 6\npulsations at JAN (located between the Scandinavian\nand midnight sectors at 70.3\u00b0 magnitude latitude)\nsuggests that the observed omega bands have not\npropagated eastward from the region of substorm\nonset\/intensification but have been created in the\nmorning sector in response to the substorm onset. In\norder to more fully determine whether or not all omega\nbands are triggered by an expansion phase onset during\nthe substorm recovery phase, as appears to be the case\nhere, it will be necessary to perform an extensive\nstatistical study of previous omega band intervals and\nthis will be the basis for future research.\n5 Summary\nDuring the interval 00\u201308 UT on 11 May, 1998, the\nCUTLASS Finland HF radar was operating in a high\ntime resolution mode providing 14 s observations of a\nsingle beam in an approximately poleward direction.\nBetween 01:30\u201303:30 UT a series of five intervals of flow\nof latitudinal extent ~1.5\u00b0 were observed to propagate\naway from the radar, each lasting for ~10 min with a\nrepetition period ~18 min. The STARE Norway VHF\nradar operating in a standard scan mode with temporal\nresolution ~20 s also observed extended regions of\npoleward flow of similar duration and repetition fre-\nquency. The latitudinal extent of the enhanced flow\nregion was consistent with that measured by HF radar\nalthough STARE observations preceded those from\nCUTLASS by ~5 min.\nStations of the IMAGE magnetometer network\nsituated in the Scandinavian sector (~05:00 MLT)\nrecorded at least five intense Ps 6 pulsation wave-cycles\nin both the X and Y components between 02:00\u201303:30\nUT implying the nearby transit of a series of auroral\nomega bands. The scale size of these omega bands has\nbeen estimated at ~400 km in the longitudinal direction\nand ~600 km latitude. The delay between observing the\npulsations at longitudinally separated stations indicates\nthat the eastward propagation of the omega bands is at\na speed of ~0.75 km s)1. By studying ionospheric\nelectric fields, ground magnetometer data, derived\nequivalent currents and derived ionospheric Hall con-\nductances the spatial structure of the observed omega\nbands has been deduced. The region of elevated\nconductance has a peak value at the westward edge of\neach omega bands, and appears to be associated with\nupward FAC (assumed to be downward precipitating\nelectrons). Downward FACs are located outside of the\nhigh conductance regions. The Hall currents that arise\nas a result of both upward and downward FACs result\nin strong flows in the region just poleward the auroral\nboundary between the high conductance regions (in-\nferred to be bright tongues) and weak equatorward\nflows at the tip of the tongues. This structure is\nconsistent with omega band formation due to a\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability near or at the poleward\nboundary of the auroral oval although observations that\nwould verify this supposition are not available for this\ninterval.\nThe interval during which the radar observations\nwere made occurred during a period of several magne-\ntospheric substorm onset\/intensifications and simulta-\nneously with a new intensification at 01:50 UT observed\nby the Greenland west coast magnetometer chain\nlocated at ~23:30 MLT. It is suggested that the global\nresponse to a onset\/intensification that occurs during the\nrecovery phase of a previous substorm acts as a trigger\ncausing the downward current at the poleward edge of\nthe auroral oval to the east to become unstable. The\nseries of filamentary FACs that would then result\nmanifest themselves as omega bands at the poleward\nboundary of the auroral oval.\nAcknowledgements.
