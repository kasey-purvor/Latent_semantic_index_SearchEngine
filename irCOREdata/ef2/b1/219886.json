Patients with coronary heart disease were identified from general practice computer systems, recruited and randomized (2:1) to intervention or control. The 12-month intervention comprised an initial consultation with a community pharmacist to review appropriateness of therapy, compliance, lifestyle, social and support issues. Control patients received standard care. The primary outcome measures were appropriate treatment [derived from the National Service Framework (NSF)], health status (SF-36, EQ-5D) and an economic evaluation.

No statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups were shown at follow-up for any of the primary outcome measures such as numbers on aspirin or lifestyle measures. There were few differences in quality of life (SF-36) between the intervention and control groups at baseline or follow-up or with overall EQ-5D score over time. The total National Health Service cost increased between baseline and at 12 months in both groups but to a greater extent in the intervention group.
