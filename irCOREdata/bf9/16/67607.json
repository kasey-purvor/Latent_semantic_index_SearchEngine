The activation lasted \u000110 min, occurred during geomagnetically quiet\nconditions (Dst\u0002\u000310 nT), and was followed by a global-scale substorm about half an hour\nlater (at 2246 UT). Both the pseudo-breakup and the substorm had onsets at times\ncorresponding to the Wind satellite observations of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BZ\nnorthward turnings as delayed to the subsolar magnetopause. The auroral display of the\npseudo-breakup was a mesoscale spiral with a counterclockwise winding direction.\nSimultaneously, STARE recorded clockwise plasma flow in the spiral surroundings.\nApplying the method of characteristics to the MIRACLE observations revealed that the\nspiral was associated with a localized current wedge (less than a few hours inMLTand about\n4\u0001 in latitude), tilted in the northeast-southwest direction. The maximum upward current\ndensity at the western edge of the wedge was about 6 A\/km2, which clearly exceeds the\nthreshold of spiral buildup (2.5 A\/km2) suggested by earlier theoretical studies. About an\nhour before the pseudo-breakup, the energy input from the solar wind to the magnetosphere\n(quantified by the \u0001 parameter) exceeded the substorm threshold and the ionospheric\nconductivity was high enough to support substorm activity. Two likely reasons for the\nactivation to remain localizedwere its unfavorable location in themorning side of theHarang\ndiscontinuity region and the abrupt decrease of the solar wind energy input at its onset\ntime.

Introduction\n[2] A pseudo-breakup is a small, localized substorm-like\nactivation, which typically lasts less than 10 min and does\nnot lead to a global reconfiguration of the magnetotail like\nsubstorms do. A pseudo-breakup typically precedes a full-\nscale substorm by some tens of minutes [Koskinen et al.,\n1993; Cattell et al., 1994]. In the literature, the definition of\na pseudo-breakup often varies depending on the available\nobservations. Some of the observations, without mentioning\nthe term \u2018\u2018pseudo-breakup\u2019\u2019, carry the characteristics of\nwhat is now known to belong to a pseudo-breakup. Orig-\ninally, the term was used to describe a highly localized (both\nin space and time) auroral activation in the ionosphere, but\nlater, with increasing availability of satellite observations,\nalso localized magnetospheric activations were included in\nthis definition.\n[3] Despite being localized and short-lived, pseudo-\nbreakups do not show any significant differences from\nsubstorm, either in the ionosphere or in the magnetosphere\n[e.g., Pulkkinen, 1996; Aikio et al., 1999]. Thus, the trigger\nmechanism is expected to be similar for both kind of\nactivations, and other properties must be in control of the\nsize and duration of the event. Rostoker [1998] suggested\nthat all auroral breakup activations are controlled by the\nsame physics - no matter what the size is - and the substorm\nexpansions are built up of a series of small-scale current\nsystems, one of which could show up as a pseudo-breakup.\nIn fact, the pseudo-breakup disturbances both in the plasma\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO. A1, 1020, doi:10.1029\/2002JA009276, 2003\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/03\/2002JA009276$09.00\nSIA 4 - 1\nsheet [Koskinen et al., 1993; Pulkkinen et al., 1998] and on\nthe ground [e.g., Ohtani et al., 1993] can also locally be of\nthe same order of magnitude as the substorm onset-related\ndisturbances. Pseudo-breakups can be associated with mag-\nnetic reconnection in the tail as well as a local dipolarization\nof the geomagnetic field, disruption of the tail current,\ndispersionless particle injections, and formation of a current\nwedge [Koskinen et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1994;\nPulkkinen et al., 1998]. Some pseudo-breakups have even\nbeen observed together with the ejection of a plasmoid\n[Aikio et al., 1999].\n[4] Pseudo-breakups have been observed in regions pole-\nward [Akasofu, 1964] equatorward [Nakamura et al., 1994]\nand westward [Amm et al., 2001; Koskinen et al., 1993;\nOhtani et al., 1993] of the following substorm activity.\nVortex-like auroral structures (bulges, spirals, etc.) have often\nbeen recorded during pseudo-breakups [Nakamura et al.,\n1994; Amm et al., 2001] but, as reported by Partamies et al.\n[2001], auroral spirals per se do not imply a pseudo-breakup\nor any particular kind of magnetic activity. In the case studied\nhere, a pseudo-breakup spiral was very clear and it was\nlocated poleward and eastward of the following substorm.\n[5] The ionospheric and magnetospheric mechanisms\npreventing a pseudo-breakup from growing to a global-\nscale activation are still under discussion. At least three\ndifferent possibilities have been suggested in the literature:\ninsufficient energy flow from the solar wind to the magneto-\nsphere, lack of stored energy in the tail [Nakamura et al.,\n1994; Ohtani et al., 1993; Amm et al., 2001], or too low\nionospheric conductivity to close the substorm current\nwedge [Koskinen et al., 1993]. In this context, ionospheric\nfeedback processes have to be taken into account because\nthe travel time of the Alfve\u00b4n waves (information) between\nthe ionosphere and the magnetotail is about 1\u20135 min, which\nis of the order of the lifetime for pseudo-breakups [Pulkki-\nnen, 1996].\n[6] Amm et al. [2001] studied the ionospheric electro-\ndynamics of a pseudo-breakup event with the method of\ncharacteristics which provides a rigorous way to define the\ntwo-dimensional distribution of total ionospheric currents\nand conductivities. In their case, the conductivity in the\nanalysis area appeared to be high enough for substorm\nactivity and the current system was very similar to a sub-\nstorm current wedge. Only western edge of the wedge, i.e.,\nupward currents fed by westward currents, was found in the\nfield of view of the instrumentation. The downward current\npart of the wedge was outside of the analysis region. The\nevent of Amm et al. however, was not a typical pseudo-\nbreakup as it was not followed by a substorm, but took\nplace simultaneously with it in a region distinct from the\nmain auroral bulge. In this study, we analyze a pseudo-\nbreakup which clearly precedes a substorm. For this case,\nthe method of characteristics yields an ionospheric current\ndistribution different from the one reported by Amm et al.\nThe global context of the event (interplanetary magnetic\nfield [IMF] conditions and convection) is also discussed in\nmore detail than in the previous study.\n[7] In this paper, we briefly depict the instrumentation in\nsection 2. In section 3 we describe both global and local\nobservations. The observations are compared to previous\npseudo-breakup studies in section 4, and conclusions are\ngiven in section 5, respectively.\n2. Instrumentation\n[8] This study utilizes the instrumentation of the Magne-\ntometers\u2013 Ionospheric Radars\u2013All-sky Cameras Large\nExperiment (MIRACLE) [Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998], i.e., the\nIMAGE magnetometer chain, FMI all-sky cameras (ASC),\nand Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment\n(STARE). In 1997, IMAGE included 24 magnetometers\nwith a latitude range from 59.90\u0001 to 78.92\u0001. The IL index\n(local auroral electrojet (AL) index calculated from\nIMAGE) was used to characterize the intensity of the\nmagnetic activity within the region covered by IMAGE.\nThis index is defined as a lower envelope of the variations\nin the magnetic X-component at the IMAGE stations.\n[9] The field of view (FOV) of an ASC covers a circular\narea with a diameter of about 600 km at the altitude of 110\nkm. This FOV of 140\u0001 corresponds to 440 pixels and thus,\ngives an average spatial resolution of a couple of km\/pixel.\nThe exact spatial resolution depends on the elevation angle,\nand is lower toward the horizon. Still, the resolution is better\nthan 10 km\/pixel everywhere. The images have been flipped\nin the east-west direction so that the auroras are viewed\nfrom above. Here we use ASC images from Muonio (MUO,\n68.02\u0001N and 23.53\u0001E, or 64.65\u0001 CGM lat and 105.70\u0001\nCGM lon) and Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL, 69.02\u0001N and 20.87\u0001E, or\n65.81\u0001 CGM lat and 104.32\u0001 CGM lon) stations to study the\nevolution of both green (557.7 nm) and red (630.0 nm)\nauroras.\n[10] The STARE radars [Greenwald et al., 1978] are\nlocated at Hankasalmi in Finland and at Midtsandan in\nNorway. They record coherent backscatter at the frequency\nof about 140 MHz. The FOVof STARE is a 400 km \u0004 400\nkm rectangular area in the region 14\u0001\u201326\u0001E in longitude\nand 68\u0001\u201373\u0001N in latitude. The radar system measures the\nspeed of meter-scale ionospheric irregularities in the E\nregion at times when the electric field is larger than the\nthreshold value of about 17 mV\/m.\n[11] We also show some data from the European Incoher-\nent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar in Troms\u00f8, Norway. This\nradar is operated at the frequency of 931 MHz, and a long\npulse CP-1-k experiment was run on 3 November 1997 with\nthe radar beam looking field-aligned.\n[12] Solar wind parameters (magnetic field, velocity,\npressure and density) were monitored by the Wind satellite\nat the distance of about 110 RE from the Earth along the\nSun-Earth line (Y \u0005 \u000360 RE and Z \u0005 15 RE in GSE). Los\nAlamos National Laboratory (LANL) geostationary satellite\nLANL-97A provided energetic electron precipitation data,\nwhich can be used for monitoring the substorm activity in\nthe Russian sector.\n3. Data Description and Analysis\n3.1. Solar Wind and Magnetospheric Conditions\n[13] The first part of 3 November 1997, was geomagneti-\ncally quiet with the Dst index greater than \u000315 nT. The\nglobal AE index (not shown) indicated enhanced magnetic\nactivity from around 1730 UT onward, and two activations\nof interest took place at 2212 UT and 2246 UT. According\nto the Wind satellite (XGSE \u0001 110 RE), the IMF BZ was\npositive at noon but started to decrease around 13 UT. After\nremaining negative (\u0001\u00034 nT) for several hours, the IMF BZ\nSIA 4 - 2 PARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION\nsuddenly increased by about 3 nT at 2141 UT (second panel\nin Figure 1) and simultaneous minor changes were observed\nin solar wind pressure and density. The third panel of Figure\n1 shows the 1-min averaged \u0001 parameter derived from the\nsolar wind magnetic field data recorded by Wind according\nto the definition by Perreault and Akasofu [1978]. It had\nbeen at an elevated level for hours and became larger than\nthe substorm threshold value of 1011 W [Akasofu, 1981]\nabout an hour before the first activation. At 2141 UT the\nenergy input from the solar wind to the magnetosphere\nsuddenly decreased from 1.5 \u0006 1011 to 0.4 \u0006 1011 W. The\ntime lag from the Wind location to the magnetopause was\napproximately 31 min according to the observed average\nsolar wind speed (330 km\/s). Thus, the northward turning\nand decrease in e reached the magnetopause at the time of\nthe first activation at 2212 UT (for caveats, see section 4.2).\nSimultaneously, the particle instrument onboard the Los\nAlamos National Laboratory (LANL) LANL-97A satellite\n(foot point at about 67\u0001N and 70\u0001E in geographical\ncoordinates) recorded a drifting hole in the energetic\nelectron fluxes (lower panel in Figure 2). Similar holes\nhave been observed at substorm onsets, they are of the\nsame origin and occur simultaneously (but at higher ener-\ngies) with the substorm related particle injections [Sergeev\net al., 1992].\n3.2. Ionospheric Signatures\n[14] The top panel in Figure 1 shows the northern polar\ncap (PC) index composed from the magnetic observations at\nTHL station in Greenland [Troshichev et al., 1979]. PC\nmonitors the polar cap convection and is thus affected by\nboth dayside and nightside merging rates. PC stayed around\n1 mV\/m during 2100\u20132230 UT despite the significant IMF\nBZ changes. Only during the expansion phase of the sub-\nstorm PC gradually increased to values \u00023 mV\/m. Thus,\nTHL seemed to monitor preferentially nightside reconnec-\ntion effects and the IL index was more affected by the\ndayside reconnection.\n[15] The IL index (in the fourth panel of Figure 1) shows\ntwo activations. The IMAGE magnetometer chain recorded\nFigure 1. PC index (upper panel) shows the effect of the solar wind on the polar cap. IMF BZ variations\nin GSE recorded by Wind satellite (second panel) shifted to the magnetopause with the time lag of 31\nmin. Epsilon parameter (third panel) shows the energy input from the solar wind shifted to the\nmagnetopause. The IL index (fourth panel) describes the energy dissipation in the MIRACLE time sector.\nX-components of the magnetic field at SOD (67.37\u0001N and 26.63\u0001E or 63.92\u0001MLAT and 107.26\u0001\nMLON), MUO, KIL and KEV (69.76\u0001N and 27.01\u0001E or 66.32\u0001 MLAT and 109.24\u0001 MLON) are shown\nin the fourth panel. Vertical lines are drawn for the pseudo-breakup and the substorm onset.\nPARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION SIA 4 - 3\nthe growth phase of the substorm as a gradual negative\ndeviation in X. This means that the chain was below the\nmorning sector westward electrojet. The pseudo-breakup at\n2212 UT was observed as a \u000150 nT disturbance in the\ngrowth phase trend simultaneously with the IMF BZ north-\nward turning and geosynchronous drifting hole observa-\ntions. The growth phase subsequently continued in the\nScandinavian sector until an eastward expanding substorm\nactivation reached the network at 2246 UT. The Greenland\nmagnetometers in the evening sector (around 20 MLT)\nshowed a small signature of the substorm onset at 2244\nUT (data not shown). Neither CANOPUS (14\u201316 MLT)\n[Rostoker et al., 1995] nor 210MM (\u000107 MLT) [Yumoto et\nal., 1992] magnetometer chain recorded any signatures\nfollowing the IMF BZ turning or substorm activity.\n[16] A summary plot of the ionospheric measurements by\nthe MIRACLE network and EISCAT Troms\u00f8 radar is\nshown in Figure 3. Both activations, the pseudo-breakup\nand the substorm (pink arrows and dashed lines), appear in\nthe keogram (color-coded intensity in a latitude versus time\nplot, first panel) of the KIL all-sky camera as enhancements\nin luminosity. The pseudo-breakup auroras formed a spiral\nat the geographical latitude of 68.7\u0001 (65.3 in CGM), near the\nzenith of KIL. The following substorm onset appeared\nslightly southward of the geographical latitude of the\npseudo-breakup. The boundaries of the westward electrojet\n(based on the variations in magnetic X component) plotted\non the top of the keogram show that the activations\nappeared in the equatorward part of the westward electrojet.\nAfter 2300 UT the electrojet broadened due to the substorm\nexpansion phase.\n[17] The backscattered power measured by the STARE\nNorway radar (second panel) enhanced remarkably at 2212\nUT. The strongest signals came from the latitudes north of\nthe auroral emission, around 70\u0001. At the substorm onset\ntime (2246 UT), the backscatter region started to move\nsouthward while the intensity of the signal remained at the\nsame level.\n[18] Prior to the pseudo-breakup, the EISCAT Troms\u00f8\nradar recorded a clear decrease in the electron density (3rd\npanel). At the same time the ion temperatures (4th panel)\nwere very high. This indicates that the radar measured\nstrong electric field probably related to the pre-breakup\narc south of the radar beam. According to the ASC images\nfrom KIL, the pre-breakup arc began to brighten at 2205\nUT, which is also the time when the electron density\ndecreased and the ion temperature enhanced. Shortly after\n2212 UT, these conditions changed rapidly when the aurora\nreached the EISCAT beam causing an increased electron\ndensity layer to appear at the altitudes between 100 and\n150 km.\n[19] Only the riometers at Abisko (CGM lat 65.2),\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi (CGM lat 65.9) [Browne et al., 1995], and Ivalo\n(CGM lat 65.0) of the 9-instrument network in Northern\nScandinavia, Iceland and Svalbard (data not shown)\nrecorded enhanced absorption associated with the activa-\ntions. This suggests a localized source of energetic precip-\nitation. The absorption peaks in the 1-min data coincided\nwith the onsets of magnetic activations at 2212 UT and\n2246 UT. The absorption peak of the pseudo-breakup was\nclearly shorter and less intense than that of the substorm\nonset. In both cases the enhancement was clearest at\nAbisko, which was located close to the region of the most\nFigure 3. Ionospheric summary plot. First: KIL keogram\nwith westward electrojet boundaries.

No drift motion is\nvisible in the data as the peaks at this time resolution are\nsimultaneous at all three stations.\n[20] In the ASC images a quiet arc above both MUO and\nKIL brightened at 2205:00 UT, moved slowly southward\nand formed a street of 2 spirals. The first one was clearest at\n2211:40 UT above MUO, while the other one was com-\npletely wound in the zenith of KIL at 2212:00 UT (top panel\nin Figure 5). The latter spiral was approximately twice as\nlarge (diameter over 300 km) as the first one and its\nevolution took roughly one minute. Afterward, the spiral\nbroke and its remnants faded away, so that the sky was clear\nat 2216 UT in MUO and at 2220 UT in KIL.\n[21] The images taken by the UVI imager on the Polar\nsatellite [Torr et al., 1995] (not shown) were available only\nfor the last 1.5 hours of the day. The first UV image with an\nappropriate viewing angle was taken at 2225:51 UT, i.e.,\nafter the first activation but before the substorm onset. At\nthis time, the oval over Scandinavia was very quiet. A few\nminutes later (at 2228:57 UT), VIS images showed a\nslightly broader and more active part of oval over Green-\nland. The next four UVI images (2235:03\u20132256:30 UT)\nillustrate how the region of substorm activity expanded to\nthe MIRACLE MLT sector. The ASCs at MUO and KIL\nrecorded a growth phase arc around 2243 UT but they did\nnot show any significant activity after that.\n[22] The longitudinal localization of the pseudo-breakup\nis demonstrated by Figure 2. The dispersed energetic\nelectron hole is shown in the lower panel and the variations\nof the magnetic X-components from AMK (Greenland east\nchain, 37.63\u0001W), KEV (27.01\u0001E), KIL (20.87\u0001E) and LOZ\n(northern Russia, 35.02\u0001E) are plotted in the upper panel.\nLOZ is located slightly eastward of the IMAGE stations\nand clearly outside of the breakup current system. How-\never, the LANL measurements further east of LOZ indicate\nthat the injection region had a much wider longitudinal\nextent. To the west, the breakup did not reach the east\ncoast of the Greenland and thus, this event was limited in a\nfew MLT hours. According to IMAGE magnetograms, the\nlatitudinal scale of the activation was only about 4\u0001. The\ndispersion time of the drifting hole, as measured by LANL,\nwas 1.5\u20132.0 min from the lowest (50\u201375 keV) to the\nsecond highest (0.75\u20131.1 MeV) energy channel. This time\ndelay together with the typical drift velocities of electrons\nin the two energy ranges (assuming 90\u0001 pitch angle)\nsuggests that the origin of the injection took place about\n8\u201311\u0001 east of the satellite. Scandinavia is not yet directly\nunder this area, but as reported by Reeves et al. [1990] and\nReeves et al. [1991] the injection regions at the geosta-\ntionary orbit are often much wider (up to \u000190\u0001 around the\nmidnight) than the ionospheric current system would\nsuggest.\n3.3. Electrodynamics of the Pseudo-Breakup Spiral\n[23] Top panel of Figure 5 shows the evolution of the\nspiral over KIL at 2211\u20132213 UT. The spiral at 2212 UT as\nobserved by the MUO and KIL ASCs is reproduced in the\nbottom panel of Figure 5 by applying the inversion method\nFigure 4. Distribution of the total upward (squares, negative) and downward (crosses, positive) FACs at\n2212 UT derived from the method of characteristics. The shaded area marks the approximate location and\nsize of the auroral spiral. The letter A shows the location of Abisko riometer.\nPARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION SIA 4 - 5\nof Janhunen [2001] to the green and red light images. The\ninversion method takes into account the altitude structure of\nthe auroras and thus, provides a better mapping than plain\nconversion to geographic coordinates. Compared to the\nobserved aurora (top panel in Figure 5), the inverted spiral\nform is well reproduced and also some filamentary fine\nstructures are visible. As the MIRACLE ASCs were not yet\ncalibrated in 1997, the absolute energy flux values given in\nFigure 5 are estimates only. Furthermore, the saturation of\nthe ASC images prohibit us from seeing the changes in the\nhighest intensities. The overlayed vectors show the hori-\nzontal plasma velocity field measured by the STARE radars.\nThe velocity was northward to the west of the spiral and\nturned gradually being eastward to the north of the spiral.\nNo measurements were available within the aurora, because\nthe conductivities were high in the precipitation region and\nthus, the electric fields decreased below the radar measuring\nthreshold. The southern and southeastern parts of the auroral\nstructure were outside the radar FOV, which explains the\nlack of measurements in those regions. However, the flow\npattern suggests a clockwise plasma flow in the spiral\nsurroundings. This rotation is opposite to the counterclock-\nwise winding of the spiral, but consistent with the E \u0004 B\ndrift in a region of upward FAC and converging electric\nfields.\n[24] The method of characteristics [Amm, 1998] uses the\nelectric field measured by STARE and IMAGE magnetic\nfield data as inputs together with an estimate of the ratio\nof Hall to Pedersen conductivity a. Here a is assumed to\nbe 3 at latitudes 68\u0001\u201369\u0001, and 1.5 at latitudes 69\u0001\u201371.5\u0001.\nThe model outputs are the distribution of the Hall con-\nductivity, horizontal Hall and Pedersen currents, field-\naligned currents (FAC) due to both Hall and Pedersen\ncurrents, as well as the total FAC. The spatial resolution\nof the method is about 50 km (\u00010.5\u0001) in latitude and 200\nkm (\u00012.0\u0001) in longitude, i.e., of the size of the spiral.\nWithin these resolutional limits the method of character-\nistics has been shown to be reliable (for a detailed\ndiscussion on the error estimates, see Amm [1995]). The\ntotal FAC distribution at 2211:40 UT is presented in\nFigure 4. The region of the strongest downward FACs\nis found to the northeast of the auroral spiral. The most\nintense upward FACs are located to the east and west of\nthe spiral, about 1\u0001 south of the downward FAC region.\nOnly weak downward directed currents are colocated with\nthe spiral. In the spiral region the FACs of scale sizes\nsmaller than the spatial resolution of the method sum up\nto an almost zero net current. Both regions of strong\nupward FACs were colocated with the areas of most\nintense Hall conductance gradients (Figure 6). The peak\nvalue of the Hall conductance is 40 S within the spiral\nand the strongest gradients appear westward of the spiral.\nSimilar conductivity values have also been recorded dur-\ning full-scale substorms [Gjerloev and Hoffman, 2000].\n[25] The conductivities were also estimated from the\nEISCAT Troms\u00f8 radar measurements (location is marked\nin Figure 6) using a program called Spectrum (for more\ndetails, see Kirkwood [1988]). This program utilizes the\nNeutral Atmosphere Empirical Model (MSISE90) [Hedin,\n1991] for calculating the collision coefficients. The result-\ning height-integrated Hall conductance at 2212 UT along\nthe radar beam is about 2.6 S, and the corresponding value\nfrom the method of characteristics is 20\u201325 S. The auroral\nform has a fairly sharp boundary toward the radar (north)\nbut for the method of characteristics the sharpness of the\nboundary is limited by its latitudinal resolution of 50 km.\nThus, the high conductances within the aurora are smeared\nout at the edges causing the discrepancy between the\nEISCAT observations and the values in Figure 6. Further-\nmore, when the precipitation reached the radar beam at\n2215 UT, the EISCAT conductances grow rapidly to the\nvalues (25\u201327 S) comparable to the peak values of the\nmodel (40 S).\n[26] The total horizontal currents (Figure 7) are domi-\nnated by the southwest directed Hall currents. The Pedersen\ncurrents cause only a slight counterclockwise rotation of the\ncurrent vectors at the poleward edge of the spiral. The total\ncurrent field supports the pattern of a local current closure\nbeing directed from the downward to the upward FAC\nregion. Unlike a typical east-west aligned (along the oval)\nsubstorm current wedge, the current in our case is flowing\nacross the narrow oval in the northeast-southwest direction.\nIn the region of interest the sum of the upward and down-\nward FACs is 671 kA and 505 kA, respectively. Thus, the\nFigure 5. The top panel shows the evolution of the auroral\nspiral as a sequence of the KIL ASC images at 2211:00 UT\n(left), 2212:00 UT (middle) and 2213:00 UT (right).

The max-\nimum current density at the western edge of the spiral was\n\u00016 A\/km2, which clearly exceeds the threshold of the spiral\nformation (2.5 A\/km2) suggested by the theoretical study of\nHallinan [1976].\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Comparisons With Other Pseudo-Breakup Events\n[27] In the event analyzed by Amm et al. [2001] the\npseudo-breakup lasted roughly 3 min and occurred in the\nmidnight sector, westward of the main activity region.\nSimilarly to the event studied here, the pseudo-breakup\ntook place poleward of the following substorm. The FACs\nand horizontal currents derived with the method of charac-\nteristics [Amm, 1995] did not form a local current closure\nlike in our case, but the upward FACs in the pseudo-breakup\nregion were closed by remote FACs outside and eastward of\nthe analysis area. The region of the strongest upward FAC\nlocated at the northern boundary of the auroral vortex\nstructure, while the strongest conductivity gradients were\nfound west of the aurora, just like in the event studied here.\nSince the IMF BZ had been negative for an extended period\nand there was ample energy in the magnetosphere, and the\nionospheric conductivity was high enough for a substorm,\nthe authors concluded that some features in the internal\nmagnetospheric conditions prevented the activation from\ngrowing to a global substorm expansion phase. Also in our\ncase the ionospheric conductivity at the pseudo-breakup\nonset was high enough for a full-scale substorm. The energy\ninput from the solar wind stayed above 1011 W [Akasofu,\n1981] for about an hour before the activation, but dropped\ndown to 0.4 \u0006 1011 W at its onset. According to Kallio et al.\n[2000], the solar wind energy input during the expansion\nphase controls the intensity of the activation. After the\npseudo-breakup onset the input was very small and thus\nthe activity ceased. On contrary, during the following sub-\nstorm the e values increased and as a result a global-scale\nsubstorm took place. The location of our pseudo-breakup\nevent in the postmidnight sector was probably another\ncrucial factor prohibiting the activation to reach global\nextent. According to the coupled two-circuit magneto-\nFigure 6. Distribution of the Hall conductance (S) at 2212 UT as a result of the method of\ncharacteristics. The shaded area shows the spiral location and size. The location of the EISCAT TRO\nradar (69.58\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E) is marked by a letter E.\nPARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION SIA 4 - 7\nsphere-ionosphere coupling model of pre-breakup arcs by\nRothwell et al. [1991], magnetospheric plasma flows in the\npostmidnight sector are not as efficient FAC generators as\nflows in the evening sector.\n[28] A similar situation has been discussed by Yahnin et\nal. [1983] in a study of a weak (\u000170 nT), short-lived (\u00016\nmin) and localized (\u0001250 km in latitude and \u00011 hour in\nMLT) substorm, which took place within the region of\nwestward electrojet. Also this activation was preceded by\na period of negative IMF BZ, and during the event the IMF\nBZ turned northward. The authors consider the IMF turning\nas an external impulse trying to trigger the substorm activity\nwhen the magnetotail did not meet the conditions for a\nlarge-scale instability.\n[29] The localized current wedge of our event resembles\nthe current systems observed by Baumjohann et al. [1981]\nduring a sequence of substorm intensifications. The activa-\ntions were localized in latitude (some 100 km), longitude\n(roughly 1000 km) and time (less than 10 min), and the\ndeviations in X-component as well as the estimated iono-\nspheric conductivities were of the same order as in our case.\nHowever, the local wedges of the activations were system-\natically aligned in east-west direction. Only about one\nfourth of the horizontal currents were directed northward\nand closed by the FACs at the northern and southern\nboundaries of the active region. Thus, our observation of\na wedge aligned rather across the oval than along it is\ndifferent from the previously studied pseudo-breakup type\nevents.\n[30] From the viewpoint of geostationary particle flux\ndata, our event is not exceptional. Yahnin et al. [2001] also\nreported about drifting electron holes in their study of a\n\u2018\u2018pseudo-breakup phase\u2019\u2019 of an isolated substorm. Our\nevent could be considered as a \u2018\u2018pseudo-breakup phase\u2019\u2019\nwith only one activation. However, as our event was\nobserved also by riometers, we do not believe that the poor\nenergization of the magnetospheric particles would explain\nthe decay of the activation like Yahnin et al. did. Also\nKoskinen et al. [1993] considered the weakness of the\nmagnetospheric energization processes to be the main\nreason for the quenching of the pseudo-breakup. Although\ntheir pseudo-breakup event was associated with a weak\ngeostationary particle injection it did not cause any signa-\ntures in riometer data.\n4.2. Connection to the IMF BZ Turning?\n[31] The timing of the pseudo-breakup event of this\npaper suggests its association with the northward turning\nof the IMF BZ. According to the simplest estimate of the\npropagation delay of the IMF change from the satellite to\nthe magnetopause (TLAG = (XWind \u0003 10 RE)\/VSW, where\nXWind is the X-component of the Wind position in GSE and\nVSW is the average solar wind speed observed by the\nsatellite), the ionospheric response on the nightside would\nhave been simultaneous with the arrival of the IMF turning\nto the subsolar magnetopause with the time delay of TLAG\n= 31 min. This time lag was also obtained as a result of a\ncross-correlation between the IMF BZ and the magnetic X-\nFigure 7. Horizontal Hall (black) and Pedersen (green) current vectors as produced by the method of\ncharacteristics.\nSIA 4 - 8 PARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION\ncomponent measured at KIL with a correlation coefficient\nof 0.86. The ACE and IMP-8 satellites were also in the\nsolar wind during the period of our interest. ACE was\nfurther away from the Earth (XGSE \u0001 220 RE) and the Sun-\nEarth line (YGSE \u0001 \u000370 RE) but closer to the XY-plane\n(ZGSE \u0001 2 RE) than Wind. About 37 min earlier than Wind\nit recorded IMF variations almost identical to those meas-\nured by Wind, including also the IMF northward turning\nthat matches the pseudo-breakup timing. This time differ-\nence of 37 min is consistent with the observed solar wind\nspeed and the distance (\u0001110 RE) between the satellites.\nThe IMP-8 satellite was much closer to the magnetopause\n(XGSE \u0001 35 RE, YGSE \u0001 20 RE, ZGSE \u0001 \u000320 RE) but the\ndata were available only until 2130 UT. Although it did not\nrecord the IMF turning, all the earlier variations were\nsimilar to the Wind recordings with a time delay of about\n26 min (distance of \u000185 RE). Thus all the satellite\nmeasurements are in a good agreement with the 31-min\ntime delay between the Wind satellite and the ground-\nbased observations.\n[32] However, estimating the propagation time of the\nsolar wind structures from upwind satellites to the magneto-\npause is not a straightforward task and does not necessarily\ngive accurate results. As suggested by Collier et al. [1998],\nthe uncertainty in the propagation time (\u0001T ) is strongly\ndependent on the satellite\u2019s position in the solar wind, and\ncan be estimated by the equation\n\u0001T \u0001 D?=Dk\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0006 TLAG \u00f01\u00de\nwhere D? is the distance between the Sun-Earth line and the\nsatellite and Dk is the distance of the satellite from the\nmagnetopause. Using the GSE coordinates of Wind, we\nobtained the timing uncertainty of about 17 min. The\ncorresponding timing uncertainty for the ACE satellite is 23\nmin. These errors in timing are comparable to the\nionospheric response times to subsolar IMF changes (15\u2013\n20 min) reported by Cowley and Lockwood [1992].\n[33] Keeping in mind the timing uncertainty of about 17\nmin in the delay time from Wind to the magnetopause, we\nchecked the SuperDARN [Greenwald et al., 1995] radar\ndata and recordings from several magnetometer networks\nfrom 2155 UT until 2230 UT to find ionospheric signatures\nof the IMF BZ turning. No effects were found in the dayside\nmagnetograms of the 210 MM and CANOPUS networks\n(\u000107 MLT and 14\u201316 MLT, respectively), or the stations\ninside the polar cap (THL in Greenland and VOS in the\nAntarctic). Examination of line-of-sight velocities of indi-\nvidual SuperDARN radars did not reveal any obvious\nresponse signatures either. Iceland East radar monitors\nmainly the plasma flows along the oval in the Scandinavian\nsector. During 2200\u20132210 UT the radar observed continu-\nous westward flows (with velocities of 200\u2013400 m\/s) in the\npolar cap region (data not shown here), which is consistent\nwith the morning cell convection. Simultaneous IMAGE\nmagnetometer observations (cf. Figure 3) of the westward\nelectrojet at the auroral latitudes further support this con-\nclusion. At 2212 UT the radar backscatter dropped abruptly,\nwhich is probably a consequence of a change in the radar\nviewing conditions due to increased E-layer conductivities\ncaused by enhanced precipitation. The time resolution of\nthese observations is 2 min and thus, we cannot determine\nwhether the decrease in radar echo preceded the pseudo-\nbreakup or not.\n5. Conclusions\n[34] We have given a detailed description of a pseudo-\nbreakup event on 3 November 1997, with a good coverage\nof ground-based instrumentation and solar wind observa-\ntions. The pseudo-breakup took place during a substorm\ngrowth phase. Both the Wind and ACE data suggest that the\nIMF BZ turned toward positive values at the subsolar point\nat the pseudo-breakup onset time. The errors in the time\ndelay from the spacecraft to the magnetopause, according to\nCollier et al. [1998], are 23 min for ACE and 19 min for\nWind, i.e., comparable with the previously reported signal\npropagation times from the magnetopause to the nightside\nionosphere [Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. However,\nbesides the pseudo-breakup, neither SuperDARN data nor\npolar cap or dayside magnetometer data showed any sig-\nnatures of the IMF turning within the time windows defined\nby the timing uncertainties. Thus, the hypothesis associating\nthe IMF BZ northward turning with the pseudo-breakup\nonset remains without profound observational confirmation.\n[35] In the ionosphere, the pseudo-breakup aurora formed\na counterclockwise spiral structure with clockwise plasma\nflow in the same region. The method of characteristics\n[Amm, 1998] was used to determine the distribution of\nionospheric Hall conductivity and both horizontal and\nfield-aligned currents. As a rough estimation of the total\nFAC balance in the area of interest, we summed separately\nthe upward and downward FAC values. The result for the\ndownward current is 671 kA and for the upward current 505\nkA. This, together with the pattern of the horizontal cur-\nrents, suggests that the FAC was mainly closed locally\nwithin our analysis region. The current system resembled\nmuch a substorm current wedge, although in this case the\nionospheric part of the wedge was not east-west directed but\nrather northeast-southwest directed. The size of the wedge\nwas about 4\u0001 in latitude and less than a few hours in MLT.\nThe peak current density of the spiral exceeded the thresh-\nold value of the spiral formation suggested by Hallinan\n[1976]. The pseudo-breakup was associated with a drifting\nelectron hole recorded by the geostationary LANL instru-\nment 40\u0001 east from the region of ground-based observa-\ntions. As the first approximation (drift of the 90 pitch angle\nparticles), the observed energy dispersion of the hole\ncorresponds to a source region only about 10\u0001 (instead of\n40\u0001) west of the satellite. Thus, the injection region at the\ngeostationary distance seemed to be azimuthally much\nwider than the ionospheric current system. Indeed, the\nRussian magnetometer station in Lovozero, which is located\nbetween the regions of the ground-based and satellite\nobservations, did not record any significant variations dur-\ning the pseudo-breakup.\n[36] Within the spiral structure, both EISCAT observa-\ntions and the method of characteristics yielded Hall con-\nductivity values high enough to allow a substorm current\nwedge formation. Also, the energy input from the solar\nwind to the magnetosphere (\u0001) exceeded the substorm\nthreshold value of 1011 W about an hour before the\npseudo-breakup, but then dropped down to about 0.4 \u0006\n1011 W at the onset time. Consequently, the direct input\nPARTAMIES ET AL.: A PSEUDO-BREAKUP OBSERVATION SIA 4 - 9\nfrom the solar wind did not feed the activation like it often\ndoes during full-scale substorms [Kallio et al., 2000].\nFurthermore, the unfavorable location of the activation in\nthe morning side of the Harang discontinuity region prob-\nably prohibited it from becoming a global-scale substorm.\n[37] Acknowledgments.
