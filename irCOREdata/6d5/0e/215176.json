Introduction \nTo increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in their country is a desirable policy goal \nfor most policy-makers. Yet, often the factors influencing the influx of FDI are not \neasily amenable to policy, either because they are unalterable, like natural endowment \nof physical resources, and cultural and geographic proximity to major source \ncountries, or because changing them is a very long-term process, as in the case of the \nefficiency of political institutions, market size, or the education and productivity of \nthe local labour force. However, there are still a number of measures which can be \ntaken to compete in the rivalry for foreign investment: on the one hand, restrictions \nimposed on investors regarding, e.g., the profit repatriation can be unilaterally eased, \nred tape or corporate taxes can be reduced, and on the other hand, bilateral measures \ncan be taken, such as concluding bilateral investment treaties (BIT) or double taxation \ntreaties (DTT).1 \nThe question addressed in this paper is whether the conclusion of a DTT leads \nto more bilateral FDI between the two respective countries. If existent, this benefit \ncould compensate for the costs attached to DTTs. Besides the costs of negotiating and \nratifying the contract and giving up some fiscal sovereignty, there could also be a loss \nin tax revenues for at least one of the signing parties. This is particularly important \nfrom the point of view of developing countries as most treaties favour residence-based \nover source-based taxation.2 \nWe are of course not the first to analyse the effect of DTTs on FDI. However, \nour major original contribution to this literature is that we overcome two limitations \n                                                 \n1\n There are a multitude of different names for double taxation treaties such as double taxation \nagreements, capital tax treaties, tax treaties, or treaties covering the taxation of investment and income.  \n2\n It is important to clarify that the residence (or home) country is the state where the enterprise has its \ndomicile, whereas the host country is the state where the foreign investment takes places and thus \nwhere the income is generated. For this reason, the latter is also referred to as the source country in the \ncontext of taxation, whereas in the context of FDI, the source country denotes the home country of the \nmultinational enterprise (MNE). \n4 \nof existing studies. These have either suffered from the absence of information on \nbilateral FDI, using instead aggregate FDI in a large and representative monadic \ncountry year sample (Di Giovanni 2005; Neumayer 2007), or, where they used \nbilateral FDI data, they have suffered from a small and unrepresentative dyad year \nsample (Davies 2003, 2004; Blonigen and Davies 2004, 2005; Egger et al. 2006; \nCoup\u00e9, Orlova and Skiba 2008). This applies in particular to the large number of \ndeveloping countries, which are hardly covered in the estimations. Instead, we test the \neffect of DTTs on FDI in a dyadic country dataset, in which both developed and \ndeveloping countries are very broadly represented over a long period of time. We find \nthat DTTs increase the bilateral FDI stock between 27 and 31 percent. \nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows: the next section \ndiscusses the benefits and costs to the contracting partners of concluding DTTs. \nSection 3 presents trends in the development and coverage of DTTs, demonstrating \nthat not only have DTTs become increasingly popular, but also their geographical \ncoverage has extended to include many developing countries. Section 4 reviews \nexisting studies, which have examined the effect of DTTs on FDI and discusses their \nshortcomings. Section 5 explicates our research design, section 6 reports results from \nthe main estimations and robustness tests, while section 7 concludes. \n \n2. The benefits and costs of Double Taxation Treaties \nDouble taxation is generally defined as the imposition of comparable taxes in at least \ntwo countries on the same taxpayer with respect to the same subject matter and for \nidentical periods (OECD 2005). This may occur if one country claims taxing authority \nbased on the residence or the citizenship of the taxpayer, while another country \npostulates taxing authority based on where the income originates. Another potential \n5 \nsource of twofold taxation could be the fact that both countries claim either a certain \ntaxpayer as a resident or that an income arises within its country (Doernberg 2004). \nAlso, different methods for the determination of the internal transfer price applied in \ntwo states can lead to a double taxation, e.g., a company has a production facility in \ntwo countries and delivers intermediate goods from the plant in country A to the \nfactory in country B. If domestic rules in B set a value of 80 USD as appropriate, but \ncountry A ascertains a value of 100 USD, then revenues of 100 USD in the source \ncountry stand vis-\u00e0-vis expenses of only 80 USD in the recipient country (Lang 2002). \nEven though measures to prevent double taxation can be implemented \nunilaterally, countries have on a very large scale resorted to the conclusion of DTTs. \nBy burdening economic activity in a foreign country twice, double taxation is often \nbelieved to have a negative effect on the total amount of FDI as well as on the \nallocation of FDI across countries. In the words of Egger et al. (2006: 902): \u201cOne of \nthe most visible obstacles to cross border investment is the double taxation of foreign-\nearned income.\u201d One major purpose of DTTs is thus the encouragement of FDI. Tax \nrelief to foreign investors from double taxation is not the only purpose of DTTs, \nhowever. Another important purpose is the exchange of information. DTTs help to \ncombat tax evasion and tax avoidance and to prevent double non-taxation by making \ninformation from one contracting state available to the other contract partner. In \nprinciple, these other aspects of DTTs could discourage FDI. \nIn addition, also other regulations, calculation methods and definitions are \nharmonised in a tax treaty, mitigating the uncertainty an investor faces when dealing \nwith foreign fiscal systems and lessening the administrative effort. The tax authorities \nof either country profit from this harmonisation, as the variety of different legislations \nthey have to deal with is reduced. Closely related to the anti-tax-avoidance objective \n6 \nof exchanging information and setting rules for transfer-price calculation is the \nargument that DTTs may help to reduce harmful international tax competition from \ntax havens. Even though tax treaties are an insufficient measure (due to their bilateral \ncharacter) to completely avoid harmful tax competition (Toumi 2006), they contain \nsome regulations to at least mitigate the problem: the permanent establishment rule \nand the provisions against treaty shopping limit the circle of beneficiaries and curb \n(along with the transfer pricing restrictions) the opportunities to channel income \nthrough tax havens (OECD 1998).3 Lastly, similar to BITs, the benefits of concluding \nDTTs may go beyond any concrete treaty provision in that countries may acquire \n\u201cinternational economic recognition\u201d (Dagan 2000: 32) or, in the words of \nRosenbloom (1982, cited in Reese 1987: 380), a \u201cbadge of international economic \nrespectability\u201d with a dense network of DTTs. \nAgainst these benefits of DTTs, there are also a number of costs to the \ncontracting parties. Negotiating and ratifying the contract ties up administrative \nresources. Given the length and labour intensity of the negotiation process, and the \nadditional effort of matching versions in different languages, the costs can be \nsubstantial, especially, but not only, for smaller or developing countries.4 The \nprovisions in the treaty may conflict with domestic tax law which has to be adapted as \na consequence. Here, the national fiscal sovereignty is curtailed.  \nThe most important cost factor is the potential loss of tax revenue since DTTs \nregularly favour residence over source taxation. Due to the reciprocity of FDI flows, \nbenefits offered to investors from the contracting partner in one country should, in \n                                                 \n3\n However, another perspective is that a wide treaty network has the unintentional consequence of \nopening up the benefits of harmful preferential tax regimes offered by treaty partners (OECD 1998). \nThe OECD advises countries against entering DTTs with tax havens (OECD 1998). \n4\n Shelton (2004) points out that the negotiation of the Netherlands-US treaty took more than ten years \nand consumed probably several person-years of work. As of April 2003, Mauritius, a country with a \npopulation of just 1,200,000 had been in the process of negotiating or finalising treaties with 16 \ncountries. \n7 \ntheory, be compensated by the same benefits given to that country\u2019s own investors in \nthe other contracting state. This is because a country serves as both a host and a \nresidence country for foreign investment at the same time. However, especially FDI \nflows and stocks between developing and developed countries are highly asymmetric, \nas developing countries are mainly net-capital importers. Entering a DTT therefore \noften leads to a loss of tax revenue in developing countries (Easson 2000). \n \n3. Trends in the development and coverage of DTTs \nEarlier historical treaties notwithstanding, the first model DTT was published in 1928, \nby a Group of Experts which had been convoked by the League of Nations in 1921. \nEven though since then the international tax legislation has become considerably \nmore complex, the commentaries more extensive and some tax loopholes have had to \nbe closed, this model treaty still forms the basis for all DTTs in force today (Graetz \nand O\u2019Hear 1997). \nFigure 1 illustrates the development of the annual average of new treaty \nconclusions, treaty terminations and the number of total treaties in force. The pace of \ntreaty conclusion has increased tremendously over the last decades: from an annual \naverage of nearly 18 new conventions during the 1960s, to 58 DTTs per year in the \n1980s, more than 80 in the 1990s, and reaching a peak with 117 newly concluded \ntreaties in 1998. Since then, the expansion has lost some momentum, but has \nremained at a high average of 92 new DTTs per annum in 2004 to 2007. Noteworthy \nis the fact that the number of terminated treaties jumped up at the end of the 1980s. \nHowever, this cannot be interpreted as a renunciation of bilateral cooperation, since \nmost of the terminated treaties were substituted by a renegotiated contract. Radaelli \n(1997) argues that these new contracts more strongly emphasize the role of tax \n8 \ntreaties in avoiding tax evasion through transfer pricing, or guard more strictly against \ntreaty shopping.5 \n \ninsert figure 1 around here \n \nA comprehensive worldwide network of bilateral tax treaties would require \nmore than 18,000 DTTs.6 However, the 2,351 treaties concerning the taxation of \nincome and capital which were in force at the end of 2007 encompass nearly all \nOECD countries and cover a very large proportion of global FDI flows and stocks. \nFigure 2 shows the regional distribution of treaties concluded by the end of 2006.7 \nDeveloped countries are involved as a signatory in 74 percent of all DTTs, with either \ndeveloping countries (38 percent), another developed country (24 percent) or a \ntransition economy (12 percent) representing the contracting partner. South-South \ntreaties account for 16 percent of all treaties in force, while treaties involving a \ndeveloping and a transition country represent 12 percent. Finally, only 80 DTTs (3 \npercent) were concluded between countries of the CIS and South-East Europe. \n \ninsert figure 2 around here \n \n4. Existing studies on DTTs and FDI \nAs mentioned in the introduction, existing empirical studies either suffer from a \nnarrow and non-representative sample size when using bilateral FDI data or need to \n                                                 \n5\n Radaelli focuses on US treaties; however, since most treaties contain some anti-abuse provisions, this \nassessment should apply elsewhere as well.  \n6\n Calculation based on 192 UN members. The exact figure depends on the number of independent tax \nauthorities. \n7\n This chart includes also some DTTs other than treaties on income and capital, which are the focus of \nthis article. \n9 \nresort to aggregate FDI data in order to achieve a large, representative sample size. \nStarting with the dyadic literature first, Davies (2003) examines the impact of treaty \nrenegotiations over the period 1966 to 2000 on both inbound and outbound US FDI. \nDuring this period, 20 treaty renegotiations took place. On the whole, Davies finds \nthat DTT renegotiations had no effect on FDI.8 One limitation of the study is sample \nselection: on the one hand, with one exception, all treaty renegotiations took place \nwith developed countries. On the other hand, only US FDI activity is examined. This \nis even more critical, since the US is notorious for its strictness in insisting on anti-tax \navoidance and information exchange provisions in treaty renegotiations.  \nFocussing on US inward and outward investment stocks, Blonigen and Davies \n(2004) examine the influence of a DTT conclusion on the size of bilateral FDI. The \ndataset contains 88 partner countries over up to 20 years from 1980 through 1999. \nTheir analysis differentiates between new and old treaties, the former being concluded \nbefore the sample period, the latter from 1981 onwards. The authors argue that an \nendogeneity problem (DTTs may be correlated with unobserved variables and \ntherefore correlated with the error term) is more likely to occur with old treaty \npartners, since the US tends to conclude DTTs with important partner countries such \nas Western European countries, at an early stage. Similar to Davies (2003), Blonigen \nand Davies (2004) find that DTTs have no positive effect on inward or outward FDI. \nThe degree to which this result can be generalised is again limited since the scope of \nthe sample is confined to US investments. \nBlonigen and Davies (2005) broaden their research by using OECD data on \nbilateral FDI stocks and flows covering 23 developed source countries over the period \nof 1982-1992. They find a positive relationship between the existence of a DTT and \n                                                 \n8\n Davies (2004) comes to similar conclusions. \n10 \nhigher FDI stocks and flows in OLS estimation. Compared to a situation without a tax \ntreaty, a DTT is accompanied by a 2.5 bn USD higher FDI stock in the host country \nand a 234 m USD higher inflow, respectively.9 In order to address the endogeneity \nproblem, the authors distinguish between new and old treaties. The impact of old \ntreaties remains positive with even higher coefficients than in the aggregate \nestimation, whereas the new treaties have a negative \u2013 but not statistically significant \n\u2013 influence. Deploying a fixed-effects estimation, the coefficient for new treaties stays \nnegative and is now significant at the 5 percent level, revealing a 2.6 bn USD \ndecrease in FDI stock and a 315 m USD decrease in FDI flows.10  \nThe reservations toward the earlier studies still apply: the sample has been \nexpanded beyond U.S. FDI, but it remains restricted in terms of country coverage (no \ndeveloping source countries and a limited range of developing host countries) and \ntimeframe, which does not cover the boom of FDI activity during the 1990s. \nFurthermore, only 3 percent of the country pairs concluded a treaty during the \nexamination period (compared to 74 percent with old treaties), raising the issue of a \npotential sample selection bias if the selected countries share certain characteristics \nwhich are not captured in the control variables.  \nEgger et al. (2006) estimate the effect of tax treaties on bilateral outward FDI \nfrom OECD source countries over the period of 1985-2000 with a two-step selection \nmodel. Arguing that treaty conclusion is an endogenous event, they presume a self-\nselection into the treatment group, i.e. the group of country-pairs between which a \nDTT is in force. This treatment group covers 67 observations, while the control group \n                                                 \n9\n This magnitude appears to be very high, taking into account a sample mean of 3.4 bn USD outbound \nstocks and 283 m USD outflows, respectively. \n10\n Since the fixed-effects (FE) estimator only uses the variation within each country pair, time invariant \nvariables, and thus also the old-treaty variable, cannot be estimated separately. Interestingly, the \nnegative coefficient can be seen as an argument against potential reverse causality, since there is no \nobvious reason why higher FDI activity should lead to less DTTs. \n11 \nwithout treaties encompasses 719 observations. In a first step, the authors estimate the \npropensity of a specific country pair to enter a DTT with a probit model. In the second \nstep, they conduct a difference-in-difference estimation, using the difference between \nthe two-year average of FDI-log after and the biannual average prior to treaty \nconclusion as the dependent variable. Using different criteria (e.g., similar propensity \nto sign a DTT) for assorting, the same calculation method is applied to the control \ngroup. Comparing the difference of FDI stock for the treaty group with the difference \nof a similar control group, one can estimate the average effect of the treatment. Egger \net al. find a negative effect of DTTs on FDI. \nCoup\u00e9, Orlova and Skiba (2008) concentrate their research on the influence of \nboth BITs and DTTs on the FDI flows from OECD into transition economies, \ncovering 17 source and nine host economies over the period of 1990-2001. No \nconsistent results are found as the sign and statistical significance of the estimated \ntreaty coefficients depend largely on the estimator used (OLS, random effects, fixed \neffects, two-stage least squares). \nTurning toward studies, which use aggregate rather than bilateral FDI data in \nlarger and more representative samples, Di Giovanni (2005) examines the impact of \nvarious macroeconomic and financial variables on cross-border M&A activities as a \ncomponent of FDI over the period from 1990 to 1999, covering 193 countries. He \nfinds that a DTT is accompanied by increased cross-border acquisition activities. \nNeumayer (2007) estimates the effect of DTTs on FDI to developing countries, using \nboth dyadic outbound FDI stocks from the US, as well as the total inbound FDI stocks \nof developing countries and the FDI inflows to developing countries as dependent \nvariables. The former dataset encompasses data from 1970 to 2001 and 114 host \ncountries, the latter dataset covers 120 host countries from 1970 on for the FDI flows \n12 \nand from 1980 on for the stocks, respectively. The effect of a DTT conclusion with \nthe US is measured by a dummy variable; however, since the other FDI data are in \naggregate form and are thus non-dyadic, the explanatory variable is replaced by the \ncumulative number of DTTs the specific country has signed with OECD countries, \nweighted by the OECD country\u2019s share of FDI outward flows relative to total world \noutward FDI flow. Regarding the US data, Neumayer finds that the existence of a \nDTT is associated with a 22 percent higher FDI outbound stock in fixed effects \nestimations. The positive impact is confirmed in the non-dyadic dataset, suggesting \nthat countries with a higher number of cumulative DTTs have both a higher FDI stock \nas well as higher FDI inflows. Separating the data in two subsamples of low and \nmiddle income developing countries, the positive effect is only found for the latter \ngroup.  \nIn conclusion, the studies that employ bilateral FDI data by and large fail to \nfind a positive effect of DTTs on FDI. However, their major limitation is the small \nand non-representative sample size. The couple of studies that employ aggregate FDI \ndata in a large and representative sample come to the opposite conclusion: DTTs \nincrease FDI. In this study, we will analyze whether this positive effect carries over to \nbilateral FDI data once a large and representative country sample is employed. \n \n5. Research Design \nThe dependent variable \nGiven that we employ dyadic fixed effects estimation throughout, which is \nexclusively based on the within-variation in the data, measuring FDI in stocks rather \nthan flows is more appropriate (Egger and Merlo 2007). We use absolute FDI stocks \n13 \nrather than FDI stocks as a share of a country\u2019s GDP since the latter measure would \ncapture the relative importance of FDI to the host country, but not FDI stocks directly. \nOur main innovation and contribution to the existing literature on DTTs and FDI is \nthe use of dyadic FDI stock data for a large and representative sample covering both \ndeveloped and developing countries. Our sample covers 30 FDI source countries, of \nwhich 10 are developing countries, and 105 FDI host countries, of which 84 are \ndeveloping countries. The appendix lists the countries included in the sample. \nTo achieve such a large and representative sample of dyadic FDI, we \nundertook a number of steps. Most importantly, we purchased FDI stock data from \nUNCTAD (2008), which are not publicly available. Our starting point is the bilateral \ninward FDI stock. For those dyads, which do not report any inward FDI stock data, \nbut report outward FDI stock data, we reversed these to fill in missing inward FDI \nstock data. Where they overlap, inward and reversed outward FDI stock data are very \nhighly correlated at r = 0.86. The combined FDI stock data from UNCTAD were then \ncombined with publicly available data from OECD (2008), for the relatively small \nshare of dyads for which UNCTAD does not report data. Where they overlap, data \nfrom the two sources are very highly correlated (both instock and reversed outstock \ndata from both sources are correlated at r = 0.99 with each other). For around half of \nall dyads in our sample, there are no reported FDI stock data at any point of time. We \nhave set the FDI stock to zero for these dyads if there are no reported FDI flow data at \nany point of time for these country pairs either. The reason is that in these cases we \ncan be fairly confident that there are no, or virtually no, bilateral FDI stocks existent. \nThis mainly affects dyads between some developing countries, but also some dyads \nbetween one of the medium-sized or small developed countries and small developing \ncountries. \n14 \nWe take the natural log of FDI stocks.11 Doing so allows an easy interpretation \nof estimated coefficients as elasticities and, more importantly, reduces skewness of \nthe dependent variable, which increases the model fit substantially. Note that we use \nFDI stock data in nominal USD, since there is no adequate deflator available for FDI \nin many developing countries. Using the US deflator instead is likely to bias the \nresults (Baldwin and Taglioni 2006). We therefore use year-specific time dummy \nvariables in all estimations. They also account for any trends in total FDI that affect \nall dyads equally. \nThe analysis covers the period from 1978 to 2004. While UNCTAD\u2019s Data \nExtract Service provides FDI data since 1970, very few countries report FDI stocks \nfor the early or mid-1970s at a bilateral level. As a consequence we start with 1978, \nthereby avoiding any biases arising from an extremely small sample of reporting \ncountries in the early periods. \n \nExplanatory variables \nOur explanatory variable of main interest is the presence of a DTT. Existing studies \ndiffer in that some take the year of signature (e.g., Neumayer 2007), while others take \nthe year of ratification as the treaty\u2019s start period (e.g., Coup\u00e9, Orlova and Skiba \n2008). The DTT signature date is usually referred to as the date of conclusion. The \ntreaty partners commit themselves to arrange the procedures necessary under \ndomestic law for the final conclusion of the treaty. However, to enter into force, the \ntreaty must be ratified by the parliaments or heads of state of the contracting states \nand a formal exchange or deposit of the instruments of ratification has to take place. \nFrom this point on, the states are bound to honour the terms of the treaty. Yet, the \n                                                 \n11\n We set the very small number of observations with negative FDI stocks equal to 0.1 before taking the \nlog. The same applies to the larger number of observations with zero FDI stocks. \n15 \nmost important date is in fact when the provisions become effective, which is \nspecified in one of the last articles of the treaty and is typically January, 1 of the year \nfollowing ratification. Because the date of effectiveness is what matters most to \nforeign investors, we take the year of effectiveness as the start of the DTT (taken from \nIBFD 2008). The binary DTT variable is labelled dtt_dummy. \nAs control variables, we include the following set of standard determinants of FDI \noften employed in the empirical literature: \n\u2022 The log of total host GDP in (nominal) USD (lnGDP), taken from World Bank \n(2006), to control for market size, which is expected to have a positive influence \non FDI (market-seeking FDI). \n\u2022 The log of host GDP per capita in (nominal) USD (lnGDPpc), taken from World \nBank (2006), to control for the mean purchasing power of domestic consumers. \n\u2022 The log of the inflation rate in the host country in percent, measured by the GDP \ndeflator (lnInflation), taken from World Bank (2006), as a proxy for \nmacroeconomic distortions, suggesting a negative impact on FDI. \n\u2022 Ratio of sum of imports and exports to GDP in the host country (Trade openness) \nfrom World Bank (2006), to control for openness of trade. Since a considerable \npart of international trade is intra-industry trade, a positive sign is expected. \nFurthermore, openness to trade may serve as a proxy for general openness towards \nforeigners and for a positive attitude towards globalisation.  \n\u2022 A dummy is included taking the value of one, if the home and host country have \nsigned a common regional trade agreement (RTA), which is either a customs \nunion or a free trade agreement (Source: WTO 2007). A positive sign is expected.  \n\u2022 The binary variable bit_dummy controls for the existence of a bilateral investment \ntreaty (Source: UNCTAD 2007a). By entering such a treaty, the host country \n16 \ncommits itself to meeting various obligations regarding the protection of \ninvestments, e.g., \u201cfair and equal treatment\u201d, \u201cfull protection and security\u201d, or \n\u201cprotection against unreasonable or discriminatory measures\u201d (Salacuse and \nSullivan 2000: 82-83). Also, provisions are agreed upon for the settlement of \ninvestment disputes. Such a contract reduces uncertainty and should therefore \nfoster FDI (Neumayer and Spess 2005; Busse, K\u00f6niger and Nunnenkamp 2008). \n \nTable 1 presents descriptive summary variable statistics. \n \ninsert table 1 around here \n \nEstimation technique \nIn our main estimations, we use a dyadic fixed-effects estimator, i.e. each dyad of \ncountries has its own intercept. One advantage is that all factors that a country pair \nhas in common and that are time-invariant (common border, language, geographical \ndistance, historical ties, etc.) are automatically controlled for. Dyad fixed effects also \nautomatically exclude all \u201cold treaties\u201d, that is, treaties that were concluded before the \nstart of our estimation period (1978), from having an effect on the estimation results \nsince dyads with such treaties have no within variation in the treaty dummy variable. \nFar from representing a nuisance of fixed-effects estimation, this exclusion of old \ntreaties actually represents an advantage because it deals with the problem that older \ntreaties are more likely to be correlated with unobserved variables and therefore \nendogenous, i.e. correlated with the error term. We use standard errors that are fully \nrobust toward arbitrary autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity (i.e., standard errors are \nclustered on dyads). \n17 \nIn robustness tests, we also use Arellano and Bond\u2019s (1991) general method of \nmoments (GMM) dynamic panel estimator. Our T is relatively large, which gives a \nvery large number of potential instruments. Using too many instruments can bias the \nestimation results (Roodman 2007). Unfortunately, it is not clear what constitutes too \nmany. We follow Roodman\u2019s (2007) advice to restrict the number of lags to a \nmaximum of medium length and to check the robustness of results toward increasing \nand decreasing the lag length. We have therefore restricted the use of lagged \ninstruments to a total maximum of six, but our results are robust toward using the full \ninstrument set as well as using instruments up to a total maximum of four lags. \n \n6. Results \nTable 2 presents our main estimation results. We start with a static model, i.e. a \nmodel, in which no lagged dependent variable is included (column 1). We briefly \ndiscuss results on the control variables first. With the exception of trade openness, \nwhich has the expected positive coefficient sign, but is not statistically significant at \nconventional levels, all variables have statistically significant coefficients in line with \nexpectation. Host countries with larger economies, higher per capita income as well as \nlower inflation rates and which have concluded a BIT with the source country receive \nmore FDI from this country. Our variable of main interest, dtt_dummy, has the \nexpected positive and statistically significant coefficient. In order to interpret its \nsubstantive importance, one needs to take into account the necessary correction for \nthe estimated variance for dummy variable coefficients in semi-logarithmic equations \n(see Kennedy 1981). The estimated average effect of concluding a DTT is to increase \nFDI stocks by around 27.3 percent. \n \n18 \ninsert table 2 around here \n \nEgger and Merlo (2007) argue that static models tend to over-estimate the \neffect of BITs (and, by implication, DTTs) as they ignore the dynamic nature of FDI. \nIn column 2 we therefore include the lagged dependent variable. The coefficient of \nthe dtt_dummy variable cannot be directly compared to the one from the static model \nbecause in the dynamic model it merely represents the short-run effect, which is \nestimated at around 9.7 percent. The long-run effect needs to take into account the \ncoefficient of the lagged dependent variable and is estimated at around 31 percent. \nThe dynamic long-run effect of DTTs is thus not much different from the static effect, \nand is in fact slightly higher. \nFixed-effects estimations with the lagged dependent variable included suffers \nfrom some Nickell (1981) bias, which only vanishes as T, the number of time periods \nof the panel, becomes large. To eliminate this bias, we use Arellano and Bond\u2019s \n(1991) generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. It has the additional \nadvantage that the endogeneity of variables can be explicitly taken into account. \nThere is the possibility that the estimated effect of dtt_dummy suffers from reverse \ncausality bias: rather than the successful conclusion of DTTs increasing bilateral FDI, \ncountries may conclude DTTs with whom they have a large bilateral FDI stock. The \nsame argument applies to the conclusion of BITs. \nUnfortunately, the Arellano and Bond (1991) estimator also has a \ndisadvantage. This estimator removes any correlation between the explanatory \nvariables and fixed effects by first differencing the variables. For a dummy variable, \nwhich is zero at first and then always one from the year the DTT becomes effective \nonwards (until its possible termination), this creates the problem that the first \n19 \ndifferenced variable is zero at first, is one only in the year of becoming effective and \nzero again in all subsequent years. In other words, by first differencing the dtt_dummy \nvariable, the Arellano and Bond (1991) estimator can only estimate an effect of DTTs \nin the first year of becoming effective. This is not the effect we are interested in. \nInstead, we want to know the effect that a DTT exerts over its entire lifetime. To \novercome this problem, we replace the dtt_dummy with a variable that measures the \nyears passed since becoming effective, with the year of conclusion set to one \n(dtt_age). In first differences, this new variable is zero for all years prior to becoming \neffective and then one for all years from becoming effective onwards (until its \npossible termination).12 In non-reported estimates we tested, but failed to find \nevidence for a non-linear effect of treaty age on FDI. \nColumn 3 presents our GMM estimation results. Note that the estimation \nresults are not directly comparable to the static or dynamic fixed-effects results since \nthe relevant variable is no longer the existence of a DTT, but the number of years \nsince a DTT has been effective. Importantly, however, once we eliminate the Nickell \nbias and control for endogeneity, the results suggest that (the age of) a DTT still has a \npositive effect on the bilateral FDI stock. \nWe have undertaken a large number of additional estimations to check \nwhether our results are robust toward changes in the sample. To keep the exposition \nsimple, we only report the estimated coefficients of the dtt_dummy variable for all \nthree model specifications. In row 1 of table 3 we restrict the sample to a similar \nsample as the one contained in Blonigen and Davies (2005), while row 2 does the \n                                                 \n12\n Note that, contrary to FE estimations with dtt_dummy as the explanatory variable, old treaties, i.e. \ntreaties concluded before the start of our sample period, will have an effect with the dtt_age variable in \nthe GMM estimations. This is not really problematic, however, since in GMM estimations the dtt_age \nvariable is explicitly treated as endogenous. That is, similar to the lagged dependent variable, the first-\ndifferenced dtt_age and bit_age variables are instrumented with their levels lagged two or more \nperiods. \n20 \nsame for the sample used in Egger et al. (2006). If our argument is correct that non-\nrepresentative sample size is the main reason for the finding in the extant literature \nthat DTTs do not have a positive effect on FDI, then our DTT variables should no \nlonger be positive and statistically significant in these estimations. This is in fact the \ncase, with the exception of the GMM estimations for the sample used in Egger et al. \n(2006). This therefore mirrors the existing results and buttresses our argument that \nsample size matters. \n \ninsert table 3 around here \n \nTo make our sample as representative as possible, we have, under certain \nconditions (see section 5 above), filled dyads which did not report any FDI stocks \nwith values of zero. If they are in fact zero or close to zero, then this procedure is \ncorrect as these dyads belong to the relevant population. One might nevertheless be \nconcerned that these observations drive our results. In row 3 of table 3 we therefore \nexclude all observations with FDI stock values of zero in our dependent variable. As \ncan be seen, while the estimated coefficients become smaller in the static and the \nGMM estimations compared to the full sample, they remain positive and statistically \nsignificant with the exception of the static estimation, in which case the estimated \ncoefficient is almost significant, however (p-value of 0.106). \nIn row 4 we restrict the sample to developing host countries only, for which \nany potential increase in FDI is relatively more important given the likely loss in tax \nrevenue following the conclusion of a DTT.13 DTTs continue to have a positive and \nstatistically significant effect on bilateral FDI stocks. In row 5, we further restrict the \n                                                 \n13\n Developed countries are defined as US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. \nDeveloping countries are all the other countries. \n21 \nsample to developed source countries. With the exception of the FE dynamic \nestimation, DTTs continue to exert a positive effect on FDI. \nIn rows 6 and 7 we constrain the sample to middle- and low-income \ndeveloping host countries, following World Bank (2008) classification. DTTs seem to \nhave a positive effect in both sub-samples, even if for low-income countries the \ncoefficient of dtt_dummy is marginally insignificant in the dynamic FE estimations. \nThe sizes of the respective coefficients are relatively similar across the sub-samples \nand comparable to the sample with all developing host countries included. \nIn rows 8 and 9 we exclude resource-intensive and transition countries from \nthe sample of developing countries, respectively.14 Excluding these groups of \ncountries does not change dramatically the estimated coefficients of dtt_dummy and \ndtt_age, respectively. They remain positive and statistically significant and while the \ncoefficient size is somewhat smaller if resource-intensive countries are excluded \ncompared to the results for the full developing country sample, the estimated \nconfidence intervals of the two coefficients overlap to a large extent. \n \n7. Conclusion \nIt is not surprising that policy-makers around the world are engaged in fierce \ncompetition for FDI, as host countries could benefit from activities of multinational \nenterprises through the inflow of additional capital, technology spillovers or increased \ncompetition. At least regarding policy instruments, it is still disputed how to \neffectively increase the attractiveness of a country for foreign investors. In this paper, \n                                                 \n14\n A country is classified as resource-abundant if its resource rents, that is, energy plus mineral \ndepletion in percent of GNI, are higher than 15 percent on average of the first three years in the sample \n(1978-1981). This corresponds to the World Bank (2006) criterion; however, data is not available for \nall countries, which may be problematic since countries in which FDI is likely to be resource-seeking \nare not classified as such (e.g., Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan). Transition countries are defined as the East \nEuropean former Communist countries as well as the Russian Republic. \n22 \nwe examined one important policy instrument, namely, the impact of DTTs on FDI \nstocks in the host economy. Apart from using a relatively long time period, the main \nadvantage of our empirical analysis is the inclusion of an unprecedented number of \nboth host and source countries, which reduces the risk of distorted results due to a \nsample selection bias. \nAfter controlling for various determinants of bilateral FDI stocks, our results \nshow that DTTs are indeed positively associated with foreign investment in the host \ncountry. The results hold for different specifications of the econometric model, \nincluding an instrumental variable GMM approach, and various sub-samples. Since \nthe estimated coefficients for the DTT variable are not only statistically significant, \nbut also substantively important, our results indicate that policymakers have resorted \nto an effective means to promote FDI by concluding DTTs. \nHowever, alongside the favourable impact of DTTs on FDI stocks, the \npotential negative effects of DTTs also have to be considered. As we have pointed \nout, negotiating a DTT could absorb valuable administrative resources, which \nparticularly applies to (low-income) developing countries. Likewise, depending on the \nfinal outcome of the negotiations on the DTT, host countries potentially face losses in \ntax revenues. For many developing countries, these losses are not offset by tax \nreductions for domestic investors abroad due to the prevailing asymmetry in FDI \nstocks. As a consequence, each country should carefully ponder the pros and cons of \nnegotiating a DTT.  \nIn terms of future research, it would be clearly useful to weigh the costs and \nbenefits of concluding a tax treaty from a policy perspective. Based on our findings, \ntwo opposing effects regarding tax income could occur: on the one hand, if the agreed \nwithholding taxes are lower than the existing corporate tax rate, the tax authority \n23 \ncollects less from a single company; however, as the DTT attracts more FDI, overall \ntax revenues might rise. In addition, particularly developing countries could profit \nfrom the beneficial impact of the foreign capital mentioned above. Obviously, this \ntype of analysis should be performed at a country level, as the analysis can be quite \ncomplex. \n24 \nReferences \nArellano, Manuel and Stephen Bond, 1991, Some Tests of Specification in Panel \nData: Monte Carlo Evidence and an Application to Employment Equations, \nReview of Economic Studies, 58(2), pp. 277-297. \nAvi-Yonah, Reuven S., 2007, Double Tax Treaties: An Introduction, \nhttp:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1048441, accessed: \n26.03.2008. \nBaldwin, Richard and Daria Taglioni, 2006, Gravity for Dummies and Dummies for \nGravity.
