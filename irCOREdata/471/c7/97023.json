Introduction\nFree-surface flows over rough surfaces or submerged bodies have been studied\nfor over a century. Early work includes that of Kelvin (1886), who considered the\nstationary wave pattern caused by finite elevations or depressions in the bed of a\nstream, and Lamb (1913), who found the two-dimensional velocity potential due to a\nfixed circular cylinder in a uniform stream, under the assumption that the cylinder is\nsmall and the free-surface conditions are linearized.\nSeveral authors have used singularities to model both finite and infinite bodies\nmoving in a free stream, for example Havelock (1927) and Gazdar (1973). Dean\n(1948) and Ursell (1950) consider a wave incident on a fixed submerged circular\ncylinder, using a linearized theory of small disturbances. Wilmott (1987) applies the\ntechnique of matched asymptotic expansions to the motion of a small body beneath\na free surface. All these works rely on a linearization of the free-surface conditions,\neither in an ad hoc fashion, or due to the disturbing body being small in comparison\nto its distance from the free surface.\nWith the advent of the computer, it became possible to retain the full nonlinear\nfree-surface condition using numerical simulation. For example, von Kerczek &\nSalvesen (1977) consider numerically the generation of waves on the surface of a\nstream by an imposed pressure distribution on the surface. Forbes & Schwartz (1982)\nconsider flow over a semi-circular bump in the bed of a stream of finite depth\nusing a Joukowski transformation on the potential plane to reduce the problem to\n300 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nan integro-differential equation. Analytical results are given in the linear case, and\nnumerical results presented using the full nonlinear boundary condition. This work\nwas generalized to a system of two superposed fluids and to an arbitrary topography\nof the bottom by Belward & Forbes (1993) and Dias & Vanden-Broeck (2004). In a\nsimilar vein, King & Bloor (1987) consider the flow over a step by again formulating\nthe problem as a nonlinear integro-differential equation. Analytical results are given\nfor small step height, and numerical results presented for arbitrary steps. This was\ngeneralized to flow over a submerged body in King & Bloor (1989), and to flow over\nan arbitrary bed topography in King & Bloor (1990). A numerical method involving\nisolated sources located outside the flow domain is used to compute potential flows\nover submerged cylinders in Scullen & Tuck (1995). Ploughing flows, in which a\nuniform stream is split by a semi-infinite obstacle are studied numerically in Tuck &\nVanden-Broeck (1998). Various nonlinear free-surface flows generated by submerged\nsources and sinks were calculated numerically by Tuck & Vanden-Broeck (1984),\nForbes & Hocking (1990), and Vanden-Broeck & Keller (1997). These flows model\nselective withdrawal from reservoirs.\nSupercritical flows (in which the Froude number is greater than unity) of a finite-\ndepth fluid with a mat or distributed sink are considered by Koerber & Forbes (1998,\n1999, respectively).\nIn three dimensions, Tuck & Scullen (2002) compared full numerical simulations\nboth with an ad hoc linearization of the free-surface condition, and with a consistent\nthin ship approximation, for submerged spheroids.\nIn all these works, analytic results are available when the disturbance to the free\nstream is small, but for more general situations, a numerical simulation is required.\nIn this paper, we aim to extend our knowledge of the generation of gravity waves\nby a rough bottom or submerged object in a free stream by considering a different\nasymptotic limit in which analytical progress can be made. Specifically, we consider\nan arbitrary flow geometry in the limit of small Froude number. In this limit, the\ndominance of gravity means that the free surface is again flat to leading order, even\nthough the disturbance to the flow by the object is great.\nThe problem is a singular perturbation problem, and we would therefore expect the\nformal asymptotic series developed in powers of the Froude number to be divergent.\nThis divergence is associated with the presence of an exponentially small correction\nto the algebraic expansion, which appears \u2018beyond all orders\u2019 (Dingle 1973).\nKruskal & Segur (1991) observed that in nonlinear ordinary differential equations,\nthe divergence is caused by a singularity in the analytic continuation of the leading-\norder solution, near which the formal asymptotic series breaks down. They formulate\nan inner problem in the vicinity of the singularity, and find that its solution contains\na decaying exponential in the far field, in addition to the terms which match with\nthe algebraic series. This exponential is matched to a solution of the linearized\nequation away from the singularity to obtain the exponentially small, beyond all\norders correction. Kruskal & Segur (1991) solve the inner problem numerically\n(observing the exponential along a ray on which the algebraic terms vanished), but\nother authors have since observed that the far field of the inner solution can be\nBorel-summed to obtain the exponential to be matched to the outer solution (see, for\nexample, Combescot et al. 1988; Hakim 1991).\nA similar method is formulated in Chapman, King & Adams (1998), Chapman\n(1999) and Chapman & Vanden-Broeck (2002), where the algebraic asymptotic\nexpansion (away from the singularity) is optimally truncated (that is, truncated\nat its least term), which results in an exponentially small error between the truncated\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 301\nseries and the exact solution. This allows the exponentially small corrections to be\nobserved switching on across Stokes lines by smoothing the Stokes discontinuity,\nand is a generalization of the smoothing of Stokes discontinuities in linear ordinary\ndifferential equations discovered by Berry (1989).\nThe exponentially small correction terms which appear in the present problem\ncorrespond to gravity waves on the free surface of exponentially small amplitude. We\nwill develop a procedure to determine the region of the free surface they occupy, as\nwell as their magnitude, for general flow geometries. We note that exponentially small\ngravity\u2013capillary waves have been studied in the context of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries\nequation in Akylas & Yang (1995), Byatt-Smith (1991), Grimshaw & Joshi (1995)\nand Pomeau, Ramani & Grammaticos (1988).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In \u00a7 2, we formulate the problem\nmathematically. In \u00a7 \u00a7 3 and 4, we apply the procedure developed in Chapman et al.\n(1998). In \u00a7 3, we naively expand the solution as a formal power series in the Froude\nnumber and find the form of the late terms in this series. This enables us, in \u00a7 4, to\ntruncate the algebraic series optimally, and to observe the subdominant exponentials\nbeing switched on across Stokes lines.\nIn \u00a7 5, we consider as a test problem the flow over a step, considered previously\nby King & Bloor (1987). The analytical results in King & Bloor (1987) are for small\nstep height, but we find that the small-step-height limit of our result does not agree\nwith the small-Froude-number limit of their result: the two limits do not commute.\nIn Appendix A, we apply our procedure to the limiting problem of small step height\n(thus applying the limits in reverse order), and show that it agrees with the result of\nKing & Bloor (1987). In Appendix B, we consider the canonical scaling in which the\nFroude number and step height both tend to zero at the appropriate rate.\nIn \u00a7 6, we compare the results of \u00a7 5, Appendix B and King & Bloor (1987) with a\ndirect numerical simulation of the full problem. We find that a uniform approximation\ngenerated from the results of \u00a7 5 and Appendix B is remarkably accurate, even\nfor relatively large Froude numbers. This is in contrast to the small-step-height\napproximation, which is good only for very small steps (at moderate Froude numbers).\nFinally, in \u00a7 7, we present our conclusions.\n2. Formulation of the problem\nWe consider a general steady, incompressible, irrotational, inviscid flow in the\npresence of gravity with small Froude number. The fluid velocity u =(u, v)=\u2207\u03c6,\nwhere the velocity potential \u03c6 satisfies\n\u22072\u03c6 = 0.\nOn all boundaries we have the kinematic condition\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202n\n= 0,\nwhile on the free boundary we also have the dynamic condition, which from Bernoulli\u2019s\nequation is\n\u0003\n(\n1\n2\n|\u2207\u03c6|2 \u2212 1\n2\n)\n+ y = 0 (2.1)\nwhere \u0003 =U 2\/gL is the square of the Froude number, and we have non-dimen-\nsionalized the fluid velocity \u2207\u03c6 with the flow at infinity, U , and length with a typical\nlength L which will depend upon the exact geometry being considered. For flow in a\n302 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nchannel, L will be a typical channel depth, while for flow over a submerged object, L\nwill be the depth of the object.\nAs usual, we define the complex potential by w=\u03c6 + i\u03c8 , where \u03c8 is the stream-\nfunction (with \u03c8 chosen to be zero on the free boundary), and we let z= x+iy. Since\nw is then an analytic function of z, the map z\u2192w is a conformal transformation of\nthe flow region to a region of the potential plane.\nIt is convenient to work in terms of the complex velocity dw\/dz= u \u2212 iv, which\nmay be written as qe\u2212i\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is the angle the streamlines make with the x-axis.\nThen\ndx\nds\n= cos \u03b8,\ndy\nds\n= sin \u03b8,\nwhere s is arclength, so that differentiating (2.1) gives\n\u0003q\ndq\nds\n= \u2212sin \u03b8, (2.2)\non the free boundary. Noting that\ndq\nds\n=\ndq\nd\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202s\n= q\ndq\nd\u03c6\nin the potential plane this is\n\u0003q2\ndq\nd\u03c6\n= \u2212sin \u03b8. (2.3)\nA second transformation w \u2192 \u03b6 is often used to map the flow region in the potential\nplane to the upper half-\u03b6 -plane. Then the analyticity of qe\u2212i\u03b8 in the upper half-plane\nimplies\nlog q = \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03be \u2032) d\u03be \u2032\n\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be , (2.4)\nwhere \u03b6 = \u03be + i\u03b7.\nNow in the course of our analysis we will need to complexify the free boundary,\ni.e. complexify x, y, s, \u03c6, q and \u03b8 . Since we are dealing with complex variables z, \u03b6\nand w anyway this can lead to some confusion. The complexification of \u03c6 is simply\nw, that of \u03be is simply \u03b6 . The only difference between the complexified free boundary\nand the flow region is that on the complexified free boundary q and \u03b8 are not real,\neven though qe\u2212i\u03b8 is still equal to dw\/dz.\nAnalytically continuing (2.4) into the upper half-\u03be -plane gives\nlog q \u2212 i\u03b8 = \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 , (2.5)\nwhere we have replaced \u03be by \u03b6 to avoid confusion. Similarly, we will write (2.3) for\ncomplex \u03c6 by replacing \u03c6 by w so that\n\u0003q2\ndq\ndw\n= \u2212sin \u03b8. (2.6)\nThus our problem is (2.5) and (2.6), together with the conformal map w \u2192 \u03b6 which\ndepends on the geometry of the particular problem we are considering. We can\nperform much of our analysis without knowing the precise form of this map. Thus,\nin the next two sections we leave it unspecified, so that the results are applicable to\na general flow problem. Then, in \u00a7 5, we apply these results to the particular example\nof flow over a step.\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 303\n3. Asymptotic expansion for small Froude number\nWe will solve (2.5) and (2.6) asymptotically as \u0003 \u2192 0, with the particular goal of\nidentifying the exponentially small terms beyond all orders, which correspond to the\ngravity waves on the free surface. The procedure developed in Chapman et al. (1998)\nis as follows. The first step is to determine the algebraic expansion in powers of \u0003.\nThe presence of exponentially small correction terms means that this expansion is\ndivergent, and so must be truncated. If we truncate it after N terms, where N is fixed,\nthen the error is O(\u0003N ) as \u0003 \u2192 0. However, if we truncate it at its least term (that\nis, we truncate it optimally), then the error is exponentially small in \u0003 (note that the\nnumber of terms in the optimal truncation depends on \u0003, so that N increases as \u0003\ndecreases). By examining the behaviour of the remainder after optimal truncation, we\nare able to observe directly exponentially small correction terms being switched on\nacross Stokes lines.\nBecause the number of terms in the optimally truncated series increases as \u0003\ndecreases, to determine the optimal truncation point and the remainder after optimal\ntruncation we do not need to know the full asymptotic expansion in powers of \u0003, but\nonly the late terms in the expansion, that is, the coefficient of \u0003n for large n.\n3.1.

(3.3)\nNote that the integral in (3.3) corresponds to integrating over the boundary of the\nfluid domain, and will therefore contain sections corresponding to fixed boundaries\n(on which \u03b8 is known), and a section corresponding to the free boundary (on which\n(3.2) holds); typically the free boundary will correspond to 0<\u03be <\u221e (see \u00a7 5, and in\nparticular equation (5.2), for example).

(3.7)\nThe terms on the left-hand side of (3.6) come from expanding the product of three\nseries q2dq\/dw, those on the right-hand side of (3.6) come from expanding \u2212sin \u03b8 ,\nwhile those on the left-hand side of (3.7) come from expanding log q . In each case,\nwe have listed the terms which we will see are dominant for large n, since as we have\n304 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nsaid, in order to truncate the series (3.1) optimally we need to know the behaviour of\nthe late terms in the expansion. Thus, we aim to solve (3.6) and (3.7) in the limit as\nn\u2192 \u221e.\nNow in the leading-order problem, q0 may have singularities as a function of w\n(through the conformal map \u03b6 ). However, all higher-order problems are linear and\ncan therefore introduce no new singularities in q . Thus, the singular points of qn(w)\nmust be the same as those of q0(w) for all n. The singular perturbation in (2.6) means\nthat to determine each successive term in the expansion we differentiate the previous\nterm. Thus, if qn has a singularity of the form 1\/(w \u2212 w0)n, then qn+1 will have a\nsingularity of the form n\/(w \u2212 w0)n+1. Therefore, as n\u2192 \u221e, we expect the asymptotic\nexpansions (3.1) to exhibit factorial\/power divergence, so that we make the ansatz\n\u03b8n \u223c \u0398\n(n + \u03b3 )\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\n, qn \u223c Q\n(n + \u03b3 )\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\nas n \u2192 \u221e, (3.8)\nwhere \u0398 , Q, \u03c7 and \u03b3 may be functions of w, but are independent of n. This is\nsimilar to a WKBJ ansatz, with \u03c7 the phase, and \u0398 and Q the amplitudes. We will\nfind that the terms on the left-hand side of (3.7) exponentially dominate those on the\nright-hand side for large n, so that\n\u03b8n \u223c \u2212 iqn\nq0\n+\niq1qn\u22121\nq20\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as n \u2192 \u221e, (3.9)\nor equivalently\nqn \u223c iq0\u03b8n + i\u03b8n\u22121q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as n \u2192 \u221e. (3.10)\nThen at leading order as n\u2192 \u221e in (3.6), using (3.10) and the ansatz (3.8) we have\niq30\nd\u03c7\ndw\n= 1, (3.11)\nso that\n\u03c7 = \u2212i\n\u222b\ndw\nq30\n. (3.12)\nNow, since the singularities of qn must be the same as those of q0, \u03c7 must vanish at\none of these singularities, at w=w0 say. Then\n\u03c7 = \u2212i\n\u222b w\nw0\ndw\nq30\n. (3.13)\nProceeding to the next order in n in (3.6) we find \u03b3=constant, and then at the next\norder\nq20Q\n\u2032 \u2212 2q0q1Q\u03c7 \u2032 + 2q0q \u20320Q = \u2212 iq1Q\nq20\n(3.14)\nwhere \u2032 \u2261 d\/dw, i.e.\nQ\u2032\nQ\n= \u22122q\n\u2032\n0\nq0\n\u2212 3iq1\nq40\nby (3.11).

By (3.9) and (3.8), the amplitude function\nfor the late terms in \u03b8 is given by\n\u0398 = \u2212\u039bi\nq30\nexp\n(\n\u22123i\n\u222b w\nw\u2217\nq1\nq40\ndw\n)\n. (3.16)\nThus, we have determined the late terms in the expansion of \u03b8 and q , up to the (as\nyet) arbitrary constants \u03b3 and \u039b. To summarize, we have\n\u03b8n \u223c \u2212 i\u039b\nq30\nexp\n(\n\u22123i\n\u222b w\nw\u2217\nq1\nq40\ndw\n)\n\n(n + \u03b3 )\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\n, qn \u223c \u039b\nq20\nexp\n(\n\u22123i\n\u222b w\nw\u2217\nq1\nq40\ndw\n)\n\n(n + \u03b3 )\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\n,\n(3.17)\nwith \u03c7 given by (3.13).

To determine \u039b, we must match with an inner region in the vicinity of w0,\nwhich we will do in \u00a7 3.3.\nTo do this matching we need to know the behaviour of (3.17) as w \u2192w0, which we\nnow determine.

(3.19)\n3.2. Inner limit of q0\nTo determine \u03b3 , we must examine the order of the singularity in q0 as w \u2192w0. This\nwill depend on the type of singularity in the flow field. Typical singularities include\nstagnation points, sources, sinks and flow around the corner of an obstacle.\nFor stagnation points and flow around corners, locally in the vicinity of the\nsingularity we have w \u2212 w0 = const \u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)k for some k \t=1. For a stagnation point\n306 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\ngenerically k=2, whereas for flow around a corner k=\u03c0\/\u03b2 where \u03b2 is the interior\n(i.e. in the fluid) angle of the corner. Then, for the corresponding singularity on the\nanalytic continuation of the free boundary\ndw\ndz\n= q0e\n\u2212i\u03b80 = q0 = const \u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)k\u22121 = const \u00d7 (w \u2212 w0)(k\u22121)\/k, (3.20)\nremembering that \u03b80 = 0. Thus, q0 \u223c c(w \u2212w0)\u03b1 where \u03b1=(k \u2212 1)\/k and c is constant,\nand we have\n\u03c7 \u223c \u2212 i(w \u2212 w0)\n1\u22123\u03b1\nc3(1 \u2212 3\u03b1) . (3.21)\nRemembering that we need \u03c7 to vanish at w=w0, we see that we require \u03b1 < 1\/3.\nOnly those singularities with \u03b1 < 1\/3 will generate Stokes lines and their associated\nexponentially small correction terms. In particular, this means that Stokes lines (and\ngravity waves) are not generated by stagnation points, and will only be generated by\ncorners with in-the-fluid angles greater than 2\u03c0\/3 (unlike the case of capillary waves\nstudied in Chapman & Vanden-Broeck 2002). At singularities with \u03b1\u0001 1\/3, the phase\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u221e. Although not generated by such singularities (which correspond to the point\nat infinity in the standard examples from second-order linear ordinary differential\nequations) Stokes lines will often end at them; they are discussed in more detail in\nChapman & King (2003).\nNow, for the asymptotic behaviour (3.21) to be consistent with (3.18) we require\nthat\n(1 \u2212 3\u03b1)\u03b3 + 5\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1,\ni.e.\n\u03b3 = \u2212 6\u03b1\n1 \u2212 3\u03b1 . (3.22)\nFinally, the alternative to w \u2212 w0 being a power of z locally is to have w \u2212\nw0 = const \u00d7 log(z \u2212 z0), corresponding to a source or sink. In that case,\ndw\ndz\n= q0 exp(\u2212i\u03b80) = q0 = const \u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)\u22121 = const \u00d7 exp(\u2212(w \u2212 w0)),\nand there is no singularity in q0.\n3.3. Inner expansion in the vicinity of the complex singularity\nTo determine \u039b, we must match with an inner solution in the vicinity of the singularity\nin the complex plane. Now in the vicinity of the complex singularity w0, log q \u2212 i\u03b8 is\nequal to the (regular) expansion of the right-hand side of (2.5), which is evaluated\non the real axis, and therefore involves the outer expansion of q and \u03b8 , away from\nthe singularity. However, we know that inserting the expansions for q and \u03b8 into the\nright-hand side simply gives the outer expansion of log q \u2212 i\u03b8 . The right-hand side\nof this equation in the inner region is therefore simply the inner limit of log q \u2212 i\u03b8 .\nHence, since \u03b80 = 0 and\nq0 \u223c c(w \u2212 w0)\u03b1,\nin the vicinity of w0, we have\nqe\u2212i\u03b8 = c(w \u2212 w0)\u03b1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.23)\n\u0003q2\ndq\ndw\n= \u2212sin \u03b8. (3.24)\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 307\nMotivated by (3.21) we define the inner variable \u03b7 by w=w0 + \u0003\n1\/(1\u22123\u03b1)\u03b7 (remembering\nthat \u03b1 < 1\/3), and set q = \u0003\u03b1\/(1\u22123\u03b1)c\u03b7\u03b1q\u00af .

Stokes line smoothing\nHaving determined the late terms of the divergent asymptotic expansion we are\nin a position to identify the exponentially small terms switched on across Stokes\nlines. We keep the analysis here brief since the details are very similar to calculations\nwhich have appeared elsewhere (Chapman et al. 1998; Chapman 1999; Chapman &\nVanden-Broeck 2002).\n308 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nWe begin by truncating the expansion after N terms, so that\n\u03b8 =\nN\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u0003n\u03b8n + RN, q =\nN\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u0003nqn + SN.\nThen the remainders SN and RN satisfy\nSN\nq0\n\u2212 \u0003q1SN\nq20\n\u2212 \u0003\nNq1qN\u22121\nq20\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = iRN, (4.1)\n\u0003q20S\n\u2032\nN + 2\u0003q0q\n\u2032\n0SN + 2\u0003\n2q0q1S\n\u2032\nN + 2\u0003\n2q0q\n\u2032\n1SN + \u0003\n2q1q\n\u2032\n0SN + \u0003\nN\u03b8N + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = RN + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(4.2)\nwhere the omitted terms are lower order as N \u2192 \u221e and \u0003 \u2192 0. The homogeneous\nversions of these equations have a solution\nRN \u223c \u0398e\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003, SN \u223c Qe\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003, (4.3)\ncorresponding to gravity waves on the free surface. Following Dingle (1973) we expect\nthere to be Stokes lines whenever successive terms in the expansions of \u03b8 and q have\nthe same phase, i.e. when \u03c7 is real and positive. We will show that a multiple of (4.3)\nis switched on across these Stokes lines. We define the Stokes multiplier A by setting\nSN = AQe\n\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003.\nThen, using (4.1) in (4.2) and noting (3.11) and (3.14), gives\n\u0003q30\ndA\ndw\nQe\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003 \u223c i\u0003NqN,\nas \u0003 \u2192 0 and N \u2192 \u221e. Changing variable to write A as a function of \u03c7 instead of w,\nand using the expression (3.17) for qN gives\ndA\nd\u03c7\n=\n\u0003N\u22121e\u03c7\/\u0003\n(N + \u03b3 )\n\u03c7N+\u03b3\n. (4.4)\nNow the right-hand side of (4.4) is minimal for N \u223c |\u03c7 |\/\u0003, corresponding to the\noptimal truncation point. Hence we let N = |\u03c7 |\/\u0003 + \u03c1, where \u03c1 is bounded as \u0003 \u2192 0.\nThen, since N is a function of |\u03c7 | only, following Chapman et al. (1998) we write\n\u03c7= rei\u03d1 and write\nd\nd\u03c7\n= \u2212 ie\n\u2212i\u03d1\nr\nd\nd\u03d1\n.\nThen, as \u0003 \u2192 0, using Stirling\u2019s approximation of the \n-function,\ndA\nd\u03d1\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r exp(i\u03d1)\u0003N+\u03b3 exp(r exp(i\u03d1)\/\u0003) exp(\u2212N \u2212 \u03b3 )(N + \u03b3 )N+\u03b3\u22121\/2\n\u00031+\u03b3 rN+\u03b3 exp(i(N + \u03b3 )\u03d1)\n,\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r1\/2 exp(i\u03d1) exp(r exp(i\u03d1)\/\u0003) exp(\u2212r\/\u0003 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b3 )\n\u00031\/2+\u03b3 exp(i(r\/\u0003 + \u03c1 + \u03b3 )\u03d1)\n(\n1 +\n\u0003(\u03c1 + \u03b3 )\nr\n)r\/\u0003+\u03c1+\u03b3\n,\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r1\/2 exp(i\u03d1) exp(r exp(i\u03d1)\/\u0003) exp(\u2212r\/\u0003)\n\u00031\/2+\u03b3 exp(i\u03d1(r\/\u0003 + \u03c1 + \u03b3 ))\n.\nNow, the right-hand side is exponentially small except near \u03d1 =0, which is the Stokes\nline. Thus there is a rapid variation in A at this point, corresponding to the switching\non of our subdominant exponential. To examine this transition we introduce the local\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 309\nscaling \u03d1 = \u03b4\u03d1\u00af , giving\ndA\nd\u03d1\u00af\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r1\/2\u03b4 exp(\u2212r\u03b42\u03d1\u00af2\/(2\u0003))\n\u00031\/2+\u03b3\n.\nWe see that the correct scaling is \u03b4= \u00031\/2, giving\ndA\nd\u03d1\u00af\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0r1\/2 exp(\u2212r\u03d1\u00af2\/2)\n\u0003\u03b3\n.\nHence\nA = A0 +\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 i\n\u0003\u03b3\n\u222b \u03d1\u221ar\n\u2212\u221e\nexp(\u2212t2\/2) dt.\nMatching with the outer solution away from the Stokes line we find there is a jump\nin A given by\nA(\u03d1 = 0\u2212) \u2212 A(\u03d1 = 0+) = 2\u03c0i\n\u0003\u03b3\n. (4.5)\nThus, by optimally truncating the expansion in powers of \u0003 and examining the\nequation for the remainder, we have been able to observe directly subdominant\nexponentials being switched on across Stokes lines.\nTo summarize, the Stokes lines are the lines on which \u03c7 is real and positive, and\nacross these Stokes lines an exponentially small correction term to the optimally\ntruncated algebraic expansion of q is switched on, which is\n2\u03c0i\n\u0003\u03b3\nQ exp(\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003). (4.6)\nSince Rn \u223c \u2212iSn\/q0 by (4.1) this means that, using (3.17), the corresponding\nexponentially small correction term in \u03b8 is\n2\u03c0i\n\u0003\u03b3\n\u0398 exp(\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003). (4.7)\nFor each singularity in the upper half-plane, there will be a corresponding singularity\nin the lower half-plane for which the exponentially small correction terms are the\ncomplex conjugates of (4.6), (4.7). Thus, for real \u03be (i.e. on the real free surface), the\ncorrection term is equal to twice the real part of (4.6), (4.7). Since \u03c7 is complex, these\nexponentials are oscillatory, i.e. they correspond to gravity waves on the free surface.\nLet us now examine the implications of the analysis of the preceeding two sections\non a concrete example, namely the flow over a step.\n5. Example: flow over a step\nAs a concrete example to illustrate the ideas we have introduced, we consider the\nflow over a step as shown in figure 1. This problem was previously analysed by King &\nBloor (1987), who found the height of the waves on the free surface analytically in\nthe limit of small step height for arbitrary Froude number. Our analysis is applicable\nin the complementary regime of arbitrary step height but small Froude number, and\nit is interesting to compare the two approximations.\nIf the flow at \u2212\u221e is uniform of speed U , and the height of the channel at \u2212\u221e is h, we\nnon-dimensionalize velocity with U and length with h\/\u03c0, so that the streamfunction\nvaries from zero on the free surface to \u2212\u03c0 on the channel bottom. Then \u0003 =\u03c0U 2\/gh.\n310 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nF\nA\nB\nE\n\u03c8 = 0\n\u03c8 = \u2013\u03c0 C\nA C EB FD\n(a) (b)\nD\nFigure 1. Flow over a step.

For the case of flow over a step, this map is \u03b6 =e\u2212w .

(5.13)\nAlthough (5.13) is asymptotically correct for small \u0003, it is not as good an approxi-\nmation as (5.12). When we integrate \u03b8 to obtain y we effectively divide by the\nwavenumber of the waves. Rather than using the asymptotic value for the wave-\nnumber of a\/\u0003b, which may not be so accurate when \u0003b is not too small (as in our\nexamples), we can simply use the exact value for the wavenumber of small-amplitude\nwaves at infinity, given by 1\/\u0003q2\u221e where\na1\/2\nb1\/2\n\u2212 1\nq\u221e\n=\n\u0003\n2\u03c0\n(\nq2\u221e \u2212 1\n)\n; (5.14)\nwe do this when we compare the asymptotic solution to a full numerical solution in\n\u00a7 6. Note that for sufficiently large b, (5.14) has no solution, indicating that for such\nsteps, the waves at infinity are not small, but of order one amplitude.\nBefore we compare (5.12) to a numerical simulation, we first compare our result\nfor an arbitrary step height at small Froude number with that of a small step at\narbitrary Froude number, a result due to King & Bloor (1987). In the limit of small\nstep height, the images in the \u03b6 -plane of the top and bottom of the step are close\ntogether. Thus, b= a(1 + \u03b4), \u03b4 \f 1. In this case, the problem can be linearized in \u03b4 at\narbitrary Froude number, and the amplitude of the gravity waves generated is given\nby King & Bloor (1987) as (in our scaling)\nH \u223c \u03c0\u03b4\u0003\ncosh k(\u0003 \u2212 sech2k) , (5.15)\n314 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nwhere k is the positive root of\n\u0003k = tanh k.\nAs \u0003 \u2192 0, k \u223c 1\/\u0003 and the amplitude of the gravity waves is\nH \u223c 2\u03c0\u03b4e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003. (5.16)\nNow, if we write b= a(1 + \u03b4) in (5.13) and take the limit as \u03b4 \u2192 0, we find that the\namplitude of gravity waves is approximately\nH \u223c 0.82 \u0003\u22121\/5\u03b46\/5e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003. (5.17)\nThis clearly does not agree with (5.16), and we can see why by looking at (5.13).\nIt is clear from looking at the exponential that there is a distinguished limit when\n\u03b4=O(\u0003); the limits \u03b4 \u2192 0 and \u0003 \u2192 0 do not commute. In Appendix A, we consider\nthe limit in which \u03b4 \f \u0003, so that we first linearize the equations in \u03b4, and then perform\nour beyond-all-orders analysis. In this limit, we retrieve the result (5.16) of King &\nBloor (1987). In Appendix B we examine the distinguished limit \u03b4=O(\u0003).\nFinally, we comment on the corresponding results for a step down rather than a\nstep up. In fact, our results do not depend on the direction of the flow, and could\nequally well be applied to flow from right to left down the same step. The Stokes line\nanalysis tells us the jump in the amplitude of the waves as we cross the Stokes line;\nit does not say which side the waves are present. To determine the position of the\nwaves, we applied the radiation condition so that there were no waves arriving from\ninfinity, that is, the waves are present downstream.\nThus, if we reverse the flow, we would find waves present at minus infinity rather\nthan plus infinity. Expression (5.11) still holds, but now is evaluated as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, where\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, q0 \u2192 1, w \u223c x, \u03c7 \u223c \u2212iw \u223c \u2212ix.\nThus, as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\n\u03b8exp \u223c 0.82\n\u00036\/5\n(\nb\na\n\u2212 1\n)6\/5 (a\nb\n)3\/2\nexp\n(\n1 \u2212 a\n3\/2\nb3\/2\n\u2212 \u03c0a\n3\/2\n\u0003b3\/2\n)\n\u00d7 cos\n(\n\u22123\n\u222b w\nw\u2217\nq1\nq40\ndw + x + constant\n)\n,\ngiving the amplitude of the gravity waves on the free surface at minus infinity as\nH \u223c 0.82\n\u00031\/5\n(\nb\na\n\u2212 1\n)6\/5 (a\nb\n)3\/2\nexp\n(\n1 \u2212 a\n3\/2\nb3\/2\n\u2212 \u03c0a\n3\/2\n\u0003b3\/2\n)\n. (5.18)\nAlternatively, we can observe that the situation considered previously corresponds to\na step down rather than a step up if 0<b<a rather than 0<a<b. The important\nsingularity is still \u03b6 =\u2212a, and the same methodology can be employed. Now, however,\ncare must be taken when evaluating some of the integrals. For example, in evaluating\nthe real part of \u03c7 as \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e from (5.4) we do not now want to integrate along the real\naxis in the region \u2212a < \u03b6 <\u2212b where the argument of the root is negative. Instead\nwe integrate to minus infinity, and then round in a large cirular arc to arrive at plus\ninfinity. Thus, the real part of \u03c7 arises from the pole at infinity in this case, rather\nthan the pole at zero.\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 315\n6. Numerical results\nIn this section we describe a boundary-integral-equation method to compute fully\nnonlinear solutions for the flow over a step. The numerical procedure is similar to\nthat used by King & Bloor (1987), Tuck & Vanden-Broeck (1998) and Chapman &\nVanden-Broeck (2002).\nWe truncate the domain to [X\u2212, X+], and introduce the equally spaced points in \u03c6\n\u03c6I = X\u2212 +\n(\nI \u2212 1\nN \u2212 1\n)\n(X+ \u2212 X\u2212) (I = 1, . . . , N) (6.1)\nand the corresponding unknowns\n\u03b8I = \u03b8[\u03b6 (\u03c6I )] (I = 1, . . . , N) (6.2)\nwhere \u03b6 =e\u2212\u03c6 .\nWriting \u03c4 = logq , we evaluate the values \u03c4MI of \u03c4 [\u03b6 (\u03c6)] at the midpoints\n\u03c6MI =\n\u03c6I + \u03c6I+1\n2\n(I = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1), (6.3)\nby applying the trapezoidal rule to the integral in (5.2) with a summation over the\nmesh points \u03c6I . The use of equally spaced points and of midpoints enables us to\nneglect the singularity of the Cauchy principal value without losing accuracy.\nThe values of \u03b8 at the midpoints are evaluated in terms of the unknowns (6.2)\nby interpolation formulae. Next, the values of y at the midpoints are obtained by\nintegrating the identity\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u03c6\n= e\u2212\u03c4 sin \u03b8 (6.4)\nby the trapezoidal rule with the condition y(\u03c61)= 0. Next we satisfy Bernoulli\u2019s\nequation\n\u0003\n(\nq2\n2\n\u2212 1\n2\n)\n+ y = 0 (6.5)\nat the midpoints \u03c6MI . For given values of a, b and \u0003, this gives a system of N \u2212 1\nnonlinear algebraic equations for the N unknowns, (6.2). The last equation imposes\nthe radiation condition by requiring \u03b81 = 0. This forces the free surface to be flat and\nwaveless as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The system of N equations with N unknowns is solved by the\nNewton method.\nThere are two sources of error in the computations, namely the values X\u2212 and\nX+ at which the domain is truncated and the number of mesh points N . For given\nvalues of X\u2212 and X+, we run the program for increasing values of N until the results\nare independent of N within graphical accuracy. We then repeat the procedure for\nlarger values of X\u2212 and X+ until the results are also independent of X\u2212 and X+.\nMost of the results below could be calculated with N =1300, X\u2212 =\u221212 and X+ =4.\nNote that, although the truncation error is K \u03b4\u03c62, with \u03b4\u03c62 about 10\u22124, we are able\nto calculate accurately the amplitude of gravity waves which are much smaller than\n10\u22124. This is because for small amplitude waves, the constant K is also very small.\nThe results of the numerical simulations are shown in figures 4\u20138. In figure 4, we\nshow an example of the profile of the free surface, illustrating the waves generated\nby the step. In figure 5, we show the logarithm of the amplitude of the wavetrain\nat infinity as a function of b, for \u0003 =0.04\u03c0 (corresponding to a Froude number of\n0.35). The asymptotic results for b \u2212 a=O(1) (equation (5.12)) and b \u2212 a=O(\u0003)\n(equation (B 16)) are shown, along with a uniform approximation generated by adding\n316 S. J. Chapman and J.-M.

The points are the\nnumerical simulation.\nthe logarithms of these two results and subtracting the overlap. Also shown is the\nlinearized small-step result of King & Bloor (1987) (equation (5.15)). The points are\nthe numerical simulations. We see that the outer approximation is very good, and the\nuniform approximation even better, whereas the small-step approximation is good\nonly for b very close to a, when the waves are extremely small.\nIn figure 6, we show the results for \u0003 =0.1\u03c0, corresponding to a Froude number of\n0.56. In this case, because the Froude number is not that small, we see that there is a\nlarge difference between the outer approximation with b \u2212 a=O(1) and the uniform\napproximation. However, the uniform approximation is still close to the numerical\nresults. Even for this relatively large Froude number, the small-step approximation is\ngood only for b very close to a.\nIn figure 7, we show the results for \u0003 =0.3, corresponding to a Froude number of\n0.548, the same as that used in figure 4. Even though the waves are not small, the\nasymptotic approximation is still good.\nFinally, in figure 8, we show the logarithm of the amplitude of the wavetrain at\ninfinity as a function of \u0003, for a=1 and b=1.8. Here we can see that as \u0003 is increased,\n318 S. J. Chapman and J.-M. Vanden-Broeck\nthe error in the outer approximation with b \u2212 a=O(1) gradually increases. However,\nthe uniform approximation is still showing no signs of divergence, even at \u0003 =0.4,\ncorresponding to a Froude number of 0.63.\nNote that the logarithms in figures 5\u20138 are all natural logarithms, so that while the\namplitude of the waves is exponentially small in \u0003, and is numerically very small for\nsmall Froude number, the asymptotic results provide a good approximation even for\nFroude numbers in the range 0.5\u20130.7, with corresponding wave amplitudes around\n0.08. As illustrated in figure 4, such amplitudes are not particularly small, so that our\nresults may have practical as well as theoretical significance.\n7. Conclusion\nWe have examined the problem of irrotational inviscid incompressible free-surface\nflows in the limit of small Froude number. We find that singularities in the\ncomplexification of the surface velocity result in a divergent asymptotic expansion\nin powers of the Froude number. Such singularities correspond to stagnation\npoints or corners in submerged objects or on rough beds. The divergence of the\nasymptotic expansion is associated with Stokes phenomenon. By optimally truncating\nthe expansion, we are able to observe exponentially small gravity waves generated\nacross Stokes lines.\nAs an example of the application of our theory, we considered the flow over a\nstep previously considered by King & Bloor (1987). We found that there were, in\nfact, three possible parameter regimes, depending on whether the dimensionless step\nheight was small, of the same order, or large compared to the square of the Froude\nnumber.\nAlthough the amplitude of the waves we predict is exponentially small in the\nFroude number and therefore numerically very small for small Froude numbers,\nnumerical simulations of the full nonlinear problem show that our asymptotic results\nare accurate even for quite large Froude numbers, for which the amplitude of the\nwaves is around 0.08, and is significant. This is in contrast to the linearized theory of\nsmall step height, which is accurate only for very small steps.\nAppendix A. Small step height\nIn this section, we consider the limit in which \u03b4 \f \u0003, so that we first linearize the\nequations in \u03b4, and then perform our beyond-all-orders analysis. In this limit, we\nshould retrieve the result (5.16) of King & Bloor (1987). In the following section, we\nexamine the distinguished limit in which \u03b4=O(\u0003).\nWith b= a(1 + \u03b4), \u03b4 \f 1 we expand\nq = 1 + \u03b4q \u2032 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b8 = \u03b4\u03b8 \u2032 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nto give, to leading order in \u03b4 (dropping the primes)\n\u0003\u03b6\ndq\nd\u03b6\n= \u03b8, (A 1)\nq =\n1\n2(\u03b6 + a)\n\u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6\n=\n1\n2(\u03b6 + a)\n+ i\u03b8 \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 , (A 2)\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 319\nwhere we indent under the pole in the integral in (A 2) so that we can analytically\ncontinue \u03b6 to the upper half-plane. We now very briefly repeat the analysis of \u00a7 3 on\nthe new equations (A 1)\u2013(A 2). Expanding\n\u03b8 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u0003n\u03b8n, q =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u0003nqn,\nthe leading-order solution is\n\u03b80 = 0, q0 =\n1\n2(\u03b6 + a)\n, (A 3)\nwhile at O(\u0003n)\n\u03b6\ndqn\u22121\nd\u03b6\n= \u03b8n, (A 4)\nqn = i\u03b8n \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03b8n(\u03b6\n\u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 . (A 5)\nWith the ansatz (3.8), the final integral in (A 5) is exponentially subdominant, so that\n(A 5) gives\nqn \u223c i\u03b8n as n \u2192 \u221e. (A 6)\nThen (A 4) gives, to leading order in n as n\u2192 \u221e,\n\u03b6\nd\u03c7\nd\u03b6\n= i,\nso that\n\u03c7 = i log(\u2212\u03b6\/a), (A 7)\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03c7(\u2212a)= 0. At the next order in n, we find\ndQ\nd\u03b6\n= 0,\nso that Q= constant = \u039b, say. Now, as \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212a,\nq0 \u223c a\n2(\u03b6 + a)\n, \u03c7 \u223c \u2212 i(\u03b6 + a)\na\n.\nFor this to be consistent with (3.8) we require \u03b3 =1.

Stokes lines and gravity waves\nThere are Stokes lines whenever \u03c7 is real and positive, corresponding to |\u03b6 |= a or\nRe(w)=\u2212log a. Thus, there is a Stokes line which cuts the real free boundary at\n\u03c6=\u2212log a. Across this Stokes line, a calculation identical to that of \u00a7 4 shows that\nthe exponentially small correction term\n\u03b8exp =\n2\u03c0i\n\u0003\u03b3\n\u0398e\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003 + complex conjugate\n= \u22122\u03c0\n\u0003\ne\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 sin\n(\nlog(\u03b6\/a)\n\u0003\n)\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u0003\ne\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 sin\n(\n\u03c6\n\u0003\n+\nlog a\n\u0003\n)\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u0003\ne\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 sin\n(\nx\n\u0003\n+\nlog a\n\u0003\n)\nis switched on, since \u03c6= x to leading order in \u03b4. The corresponding exponentially\nsmall correction to the height of the free surface is given by integrating with respect\nto x as\nyexp = \u22122\u03c0 e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 cos\n(\nx\n\u0003\n+\nlog a\n\u0003\n)\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 321\nThus, the amplitude of gravity waves on the free surface is\nH \u223c 2\u03c0\u03b4e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003,\nin agreement with (5.16).\nAppendix B. Canonical scaling\nWe saw in the previous section that there is a distinguished limit when \u03b4=O(\u0003).\nThis corresponds to both corners of the step being in the inner region of \u00a7A.1. In\nthis section, we consider the beyond-all-orders analysis with this canonical scaling.\nThe results here will bridge the gap between the order-one step analysis of \u00a7 5, and\nthe small-step analysis of Appendix A.\nB.1.

(B 14)\nB.3. Stokes lines and gravity waves\nThere is a Stokes line where \u03c7 is real and positive, i.e. where |\u03b6 |= a, or Re(w)=\u2212log a.\nThus, there is a Stokes line which cuts the real free boundary at \u03c6=\u2212log a.\nAn analysis identical to that of \u00a7 4 shows that across this Stokes line, the exponen-\ntially small correction term\n\u03b8exp \u223c 2\u03c0i\n\u0003\u03b3\n\u0398 e\u2212\u03c7\/\u0003 + complex conjugate\n= 2\u03c0\u039b\n(\n\u0003\u03b6\n\u03b6 + a\n)3i\u03b2\/2\ne\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003e\u2212i log(\u03b6\/a)\/\u0003 + complex conjugate\n= 4\u03c0|\u039b| e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 cos\n(\n\u2212 log(\u03b6\/a)\n\u0003\n+ arg(\u039b) +\n3\u03b2\n2\nlog\n(\n\u0003\u03b6\n\u03b6 + a\n))\n= 4\u03c0|\u039b| e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 cos\n(\n\u03c6\n\u0003\n+\nlog a\n\u0003\n+ arg(\u039b) \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c6\n2\n+\n3\u03b2\n2\nlog\n(\n\u0003\ne\u2212\u03c6 + a\n))\n(B 15)\nis switched on. Since \u03c6= x to leading order, the corresponding exponentially small\ncorrection to the height of the free surface is given by\nyexp \u223c 4\u03c0|\u039b|\u0003 e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003 sin\n(\n\u03c6\n\u0003\n+\nlog a\n\u0003\n+ arg(\u039b) \u2212 3\u03b2\u03c6\n2\n+\n3\u03b2\n2\nlog\n(\n\u0003\ne\u2212\u03c6 + a\n))\n.\nThus, the amplitude of the gravity waves at infinity in this case is\nH \u223c 4\u03c0|\u039b|\u0003 e\u2212\u03c0\/\u0003. (B 16)\nThis result provides a smooth transition between the \u03b4=O(1) case considered in \u00a7 5\nand the \u03b4 \f \u0003 case considered in Appendix A.\nLet us check that (B 16) matches with (5.13) as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e and with (5.16) as \u03b2 \u2192 0. To\nmatch with (5.16) we require that |\u039b(\u03b2)| \u223c\u03b2\/2 as \u03b2 \u2192 0; figure 9 shows that this is\nindeed the case.\nThe b=O(1) result (5.13) written in terms of \u03b2 is\nH \u223c 0.82\n\u00031\/5\n(\u03b2\u0003)6\/5 exp\n(\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u0003\n(\n1\n1 + \u03b2\u0003\n)3\/2)\n\u223c 0.82\u0003\u03b26\/5 exp\n(\n\u2212\u03c0\n\u0003\n+\n3\u03b2\u03c0\n2\n)\n.\n324 S.

As \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e\nthe curve should tend to unity.\nFor this to match with (B 16) we require that\n\u039b(\u03b2) \u223c 0.82\n4\u03c0\n\u03b26\/5e3\u03b2\u03c0\/2\nas \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. The matching is illustrated in figures 10 and 11. We note that the\nconvergence as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e is slow. This explains why, as we saw in \u00a7 6, a uniform\napproximation generated from the b=O(1) and b=O(\u0003) results does much better\nthan the b=O(1) approximation for moderate Froude numbers.\nExponential asymptotics and gravity waves 325\nREFERENCES\nAkylas, T. & Yang, T.-S. 1995 On short-scale oscillatory tails of long-wave disturbances.
