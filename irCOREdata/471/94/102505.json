These cooperative arrangements \nrepresent new organizational formation that seeks to achieve \norganizational objectives better through collaboration than through \ncompetition. \nPractical implications  \n(if applicable) \nThe paper provides future research directions on partner selection, \nnetworks patterns and processes, understanding the integration in \nalliances through fusion, fission, and how to manage developmental \ndynamics. \nWhat is original\/value of paper We conclude with some future directions for theory construction and \nempirical research. \n  \n  \nIntroduction \n \nThe international business literature has already acknowledged a number of positive outcomes \nfor companies actively engaged in strategic alliances, such as higher return on equity, better \nreturn on investment, and higher success rates, compared with integration through mergers and \nacquisitions, or companies in the Fortune 500 list that avoid building inter-corporate \nrelationships (Booz-Allen & Hamilton, 1999). At the same time, it is an acknowledge fact that \nthere is little understanding among business executives regarding the formation processes, the \ndynamics and evolution of inter-corporate relations, and what are the factors that determine the \nsuccess rate in strategic alliances (O\u2019Farrell & Wood, 1999). Much of the fundamentals in this \nfield were established with the seminal edited volume by Contractor and Lorange (1988) on Co-\noperative Strategies in International Business, with contributions from Buckley and Casson on a \n                                                 \n1 In: Management Decision, Vol 43:1, 2005. \n 2 \n \n\u2018theory of co-operation\u2019, Contractor and Lorange on \u2018the strategy and economic basis for \ncooperative ventures\u2019, Harrigan on \u2018partner asymmetries\u2019 - among other positional papers in the \nsame volume.  The research in the field was marked also by contributions from Cunningham & \nCalligan (1991) on \u2018competitiveness through networks of relationships\u2019, Hamel (1991) on \u2018inter-\npartner learning in strategic alliances\u2019, Auster (1994) on \u2018theoretical perspectives on inter-\norganisational linkages\u2019, Gulati (1995) on the relationsgip between repeated transactions and \ntrust\u2019, Doz (1996) on the \u2018learning processes in strategic alliances\u2019,  Little, et.al. (1998) on \n\u2018management of collaborations in technology based product markets\u2019. \n \nThe issues of trust, partner selection, knowledge transfer through co-operative business \nventures, complementarities and synergies between partners have dominated the scientific \ndiscourse. Some of the leading research questions explored were: why alliances are set-up \n(Gugler, 1992, Lei, 1993); the international context of cross\u2014border strategic alliances \n(Snodgrass, 1993, Levinson & Asahi (1995), or how to achieve success in international strategic \nalliances (Bleeke and Ernst (eds.) 1993), Mohr and Spekman, 1994). In general the \ncontributions to the field of inter-corporate strategic alliances focus either on an in-depth \nanalysis of a selected narrow issue - such as the effect of knowledge ambiguity on technological \nknowledge transfer in strategic alliances (Simonin, 1999), and methodological issues of \nconstruct validity in measuring strategic alliance performance (Arino, 2003), or swiping \ngeneralizations of more general magnitude \u2013 such as Bensimon\u2019s executive guidelines (1. \nassimilate the competencies of your partner; 2. think of your partner as today\u2019s ally and \ntomorrow\u2019s competitor; 3. Share power and resources, but share information wisely; 4. structure \nyour alliance carefully) (Bensimon, 1999). \n \nIn this paper, we seek to go beyond the current trends in the business and management \nliterature on strategic alliances, and to explain the formation, implementation, and \nconsequences of strategic alliances among autonomous actors in an organizational field.  We \nreview the recent theoretical and empirical research literatures on strategic alliances and the \nglobalization of competition and cooperation. We examine the purposes and motives of \norganizations entering into strategic alliances, and driving forces behind this process.   \n \nNext, we analyze the implementation processes and problems encountered in managing \nalliances, particularly building partner trust and safeguarding against opportunism. We look at \nthe consequences of strategic alliances, including: the transformation of various kinds of \norganizational capital (human, financial, cultural, social); outcomes for both an alliance and its \npartner organizations; their impacts on the division of labor within organizational fields; and \nconsequences at the societal level.  Finally, we conclude with some speculations about future \ndirections for theory construction and research on strategic alliances.     \n \nThe Concepts of Strategic Alliances and Organisational Fields \n \nSeveral interorganizational formations emerge when organizations search for new efficiencies \nand competitive advantages while avoiding both market uncertainties and hierarchical rigidities.  \nThe classification in Table 1 presents thirteen basic forms of interorganizational relations \nappearing in the theoretical and research literatures. The principal dimension ordering this \nclassification is that, from bottom to top, collaborating firms experience increasing integration \nand formalization in the governance of their interorganizational relationships.  Governance \nrefers to combinations of legal and social control mechanisms for coordinating and safeguarding \nthe alliance partners\u2019 resource contributions, administrative responsibilities, and division of \nrewards from their joint activities. At the bottom of Table 1 are pure market transactions \nrequiring no obligation for recurrent cooperation, coordination, or collaboration among the \n 3 \n \nanonymous exchanging parties.  At the top are hierarchical authority relations in which one firm \ntakes full control, absorbing another\u2019s assets and personnel into a unitary enterprise.  In \nbetween these extremes of market and hierarchy are eleven general strategic alliance forms, or \n\u201chybrids\u201d that combine varying degrees of market interaction and bureaucratic integration \n(Williamson 1975).   \n \nA strategic alliance involves at least two partner firms that: (1) remain legally independent after \nthe alliance is formed; (2) share benefits and managerial control over the performance of \nassigned tasks; and (3) make continuing contributions in one or more strategic areas, such as \ntechnology or products (Yoshino and Rangan 1995:5).  These three criteria imply that strategic \nalliances create interdependence between autonomous economic units, bringing new benefits \nto the partners in the form of intangible assets, and obligating them to make continuing \ncontributions to their partnership.  Different alliance forms represent different approaches that \npartner firms adopt to control their dependence on the alliance and on other partners.  The \nstrategic alliance forms in Table 1 are also associated with different legal forms, which enable \nfirms to control the resources allocation and the distribution of benefits among the partners.  \n(See also Knoke 2001: 121-128)  \n \nTable 1. Varieties of Inter-organizational Relations \n \nHIERARCHICAL \nRELATIONS \nThrough acquisition or merger, one firm takes full control of another\u2019s \nassets and coordinates actions by the ownership rights mechanism \nJOINT VENTURES Two or more firms create a jointly owned legal organization that serves a \nlimited purpose for its parents, such as R&D or marketing \nEQUITY \nINVESTMENTS \nA majority or minority equity holding by one firm through a direct stock \npurchase of shares in another firm \nCOOPERATIVES A coalition of small enterprises that combine, coordinate, and manage \ntheir collective resources \nR&D CONSORTIA \n \nInter-firm agreements for research and development collaboration, \ntypically formed in fast-changing technological fields  \nSTRATEGIC \nCOOPERATIVE \nAGREEMENTS \nContractual business networks based on joint multi-party strategic control, \nwith the partners collaborating over key strategic decisions and sharing \nresponsibilities for performance outcomes \nCARTELS Large corporations collude to constrain competition by cooperatively \ncontrolling production and\/or prices within a specific industry \nFRANCHISING A franchiser grants a franchisee the use of a brand-name identity within a \ngeographic area, but retains control over pricing, marketing, and \nstandardized service norms  \nLICENSING \n \nOne company grants another the right to use patented technologies or \nproduction processes in return for royalties and fees \nSUBCONTRACTOR \nNETWORKS \nInter-linked firms where a subcontractor negotiates its suppliers\u2019 long-term \nprices, production runs, and delivery schedules \nINDUSTRY \nSTANDARDS \nGROUPS \nCommittees that seek the member organizations\u2019 agreements on the \nadoption of technical standards for manufacturing and trade \nACTION SETS \n \nShort-lived organizational coalitions whose members coordinate their \nlobbying efforts to influence public policy making \nMARKET \nRELATIONS \nArm\u2019s-length transactions between organizations coordinated only through \nthe price mechanism \n \n 4 \n \nAn organizational field consists of \u201cthose organizations that, in the aggregate, constitute a \nrecognized area of institutional life: key suppliers, resource and product consumers, regulatory \nagencies, and other organizations that produce similar services or products\u201d (DiMaggio and \nPowell 1983:148).  At any time, a particular organizational field may contain numerous alliance \nnetworks that compete against rival alliances and traditional single firms.  The overarching \nstructure of the field\u2019s alliance networks varies according to the degree of overlap or separation \namong each strategic alliance\u2019s partner firms.     \n \nTo the extent that trust substitutes for more formal control mechanisms, such as written \ncontracts, an alliance can reduce or avoid paying several types of transaction costs, such as \nsearching for information about potential partners and monitoring to ensure that each party \nmeets its obligations (Gulati 1995a:88-91).     \n \nAn alternative psychological conceptualization emphasizes trust as confidence in another\u2019s \ngoodwill, of faith in the partner\u2019s moral integrity (Ring and Van de Ven 1994).  The social \npsychological explanation of trust is rooted in basic social exchange principles, including \nconformity to such norms as reciprocity, commitment, forbearance, cooperation, and obligations \nto repay debts.   \n \nThe formation of network relationships is intimately related to the creation of social capital.  \nHowever, networks and social capital are closely related, but not identical, concepts.  If a \nrelation proves not to be beneficial for attaining an actor\u2019s goals and turn instead into constraints \nthat impede performance, then it constitutes a social liability (Leenders and Gabbay 1999:3).  \nCorporate social capital also originates in macro-level processes that are more than aggregated \ninterpersonal ties.  Interorganizational networks can generate corporate social capital in the \nform of organizational prestige, reputation, status, and brand name recognition.   \n \nThe analysis of macro-level processes in the business literature emphasizes the concept of \nintangible assets that firms accumulate by using their human resources and labor.  Webster \n(1999) conceptualized three types of investment in intangible assets: knowledge capital \n(intangible assets which improve the human understanding of the market and the profit \nopportunities); capacity capital (intangible assets which raise the maximum level of production \nthrough employment of new organization and labor technologies); and control capital (intangible \nassets that enable firms to control their input markets, the quality and quantity of work efforts, \nand the output markets).  The latter can also be divided into rent-seeking capital (dictating \nprices to suppliers), organization capital (controlling the work flow), and market access capital \n(controlling output prices and the level of demand) (Webster 1999:14).  Analysts consider firms\u2019 \nintangible investments as enabling them to reduce competition in order to increase the profits \nfrom their activities and the potential for appropriation of financial capital through market and \nnonmarket transactions.  The fundamental bases of intangible capital include the individual and \ncollective skills, capabilities, and understandings used by a firm to influence and control its \nrelations with other firms, business partners, consumers, and governmental regulators.   \n \nThe Formation of Strategic Alliances \n \nWhile many analysts regard strategic alliances as recent phenomena, interorganizational \nlinkages have existed since the origins of the firm as a production unit.  Some examples include \nfirm and entrepreneur ties to credit institutions such as banks; to trade associations such as the \nearly Dutch Guilds; and to suppliers of raw materials, such as family farms, individual producers, \nand craftsmen.  Contemporary firms\u2019 networks typically include diverse organizations, such as \nsuppliers, buyers, competitors, regulatory authorities, financial and credit institutions, that \n 5 \n \ntogether comprise the \u201ceconomic organization of production\u201d (Ghoshal and Bartlett 1990).  \nLorange and Roos (1993) likewise referred to multinational corporations (MNCs) as \u201cnetworks of \nalliances\u201d that cross national borders and industrial sectors.  Dicken (1994) described these \nproduction networks as a mix of intra- and interfirm structures of relationships, shaped by \ndifferent degrees and forms of power and influence over inputs, throughputs, and outputs.  \n  \nStrategic alliances are not only trading partnerships that enhance the effectiveness of the \nparticipating firms\u2019 competitive strategies by providing for mutual resource exchanges \n(technologies, skills, or products).  They are also new business forms that enable the partners to \nenhance and control their business relationships in various ways.   \n \nStrategic Alliances as Hybrid Forms.  Analysts widely recognize that alliances are hybrid \norganizational forms or hybrid arrangements between firms that blend hierarchical and market \nelements (Auster 1994; Olk 1999).  They encompass both short-term project-based, and long-\nterm equity-based, cooperation between firms with varying degrees of vertical integration and \ninterdependence.  Whenever legal or economic constraints prevent a firm from using hierarchy \nor full ownership as a solution, it may opt to enter into an alliance to counteract certain market \nforces that threaten its well-being (Anderson and Gatignon 1986; Hennart 1991).  To a some \nextent, alliances combine the assets and capabilities with the uncertainties and liabilities of all \npartners.   \n \nAn asymmetry exists in organizational abilities to exert power and control over another \norganization and its resources (Oliver 1990).  Effective cooperation requires mutual recognition \nof these differences and a serious commitment by the partners not to take advantage of one \nanother when opportunities arise.  Institutionalizing cooperative agreements is very problematic \nbecause it requires new structures, routines, and organizational practices to emerge from \nroutine interactions and transactions between partners.  Strategic alliances as an organizational \nform stand intermediate to individual firms and more complex social formations such as \norganizational fields and communities of economic actors.   \n \nStrategic Motives, Intents, and Choices.  Firms undertake strategic alliances for many \nreasons: to enhance their productive capacities, to reduce uncertainties in their internal \nstructures and external environments, to acquire competitive advantages that enables them to \nincrease profits, or to gain future business opportunities that will allow them to command higher \nmarket values for their outputs (Webster 1999).  Partners choose a specific alliance form not \nonly to achieve greater control, but also for more operational flexibility and realization of market \npotential.  Their expectation is that flexibility will result from reaching out for new skills, \nknowledge, and markets through shared investment risks.  The strategic motives for \norganizations to engage in alliance formation vary according to firm-specific characteristics and \nthe multiple environmental factors.  As summarized in Table 2, this diversity has triggered the \ndevelopment of several classification schemes in the theoretical literature.     \n \nBleeke and Ernst (1993) summarize the generic needs of firms seeking alliance as cash, scale, \nskills, access, or their combinations.  Such motivational diversity characterizes alliance \nformation in many industries, and theorists have proposed several explanatory schemes to \nclassify and analyze the range of collaborative solutions adopted by firms.  The level of \ncooperation between businesses seems much less influenced by internalized costs and benefits \nthan by: the history of the partnering firms\u2019 relationships; the current market positions of each \nfirm; their joint resource capabilities; and informational asymmetries relative to firms engaging in \narm\u2019s-length market transactions (Dietrich 1994).  In other words, forming business networks \nand contractual or relational alliances is driven less by firms\u2019 retrospective economic rationalities \n 6 \n \nthan by their strategic intentions.  Two or more autonomous organizations decide to form an \nalliance for an emerging joint purpose.  Therefore, their decision to collaborate cannot be \ndetermined in a rational way by the purpose itself, nor by the current environmental pressures \nthat compel them to cooperate.  On the contrary, these factors merely help firms to construct \npost-facto justifications and rationalizations about their collaboration decision.  A decision to \ncooperate is not a responsive action, but is fundamentally a strategic intent, which aims at \nimproving the future circumstances for each individual firm and their partnership as a whole.   \n \n \nTable 2.

While seeking partnerships firms try to address internal \norganizational problems, they consider economic benefits, engage in strategic positioning, or \npolitical maneuvering with governments and competitors. The motives to engage in strategic \nalliances listed in Table 2. therefore can be grouped in 4 different categories: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.

Politica l - M arket developm ent: deve loping  techn ical standards;\novercom ing  leg al \/ regu la tory barriers\n 7 \n \nA fundamental contrast between strategic and operational decisions is that the latter are based \non transaction cost calculations, while strategic choices are determined by the perceived \nbenefits from future activities.  A firm\u2019s strategic decisions are driven not only by evaluations of \nits present circumstances, but also by expectations about its future outcomes.  Strategic \ndecisions involve both company policies and the resource investments necessary for their \nimplementation, treating the perceived future benefits as expected returns on those \ninvestments.  Strategic alliances challenge the neoclassical economic assumption of interfirm \ncompetition, because they are driven not by expected direct impact on costs, profits, and other \ntangible benefits, but by indirect positive outcomes from their accumulated intangible assets and \ncorporate social capital.  They lock competitors in cooperative ventures where the partners \nshare both the risks and the benefits resulting from their collective activity.  The transaction cost \nconcept no longer provides a sufficient explanation of organizational behavior because the firms \npay relational costs arising from all their joint efforts to build bridges to span the partnership\u2019s \nuncertainties.  Relational costs in an alliance are not merely expenditures necessary to maintain \ninformal relations with business partners, but additionally include the commitments and \ninvestments the partners commit to their risky and uncertain venture.  Relational costs to each \nfirm arise from potential negative impacts on a company\u2019s profits, occurring because the \npartners must strategically adjust their other business relations and operations to accommodate \nthe new alliance.  Participation in an alliance may require a firm to reorganize, reduce, or \nterminate other business relations in order to oblige a new partner\u2019s interests.  This post-\ndecision adjustment leads to foreclosures of some future business opportunities and their \nassociated loss of potential benefits and profits.   \n \nDeciding to enter a strategic alliance and selecting a specific governance form also conveys \norganizational power implications.  These choices are shaped by the distribution of economic \npower along the production chain within and outside the partnering firms.  Pressures to form \nalliance derive from processes inside and outside organizations.  Researchers have found that \nalliance forms vary with the firms\u2019 market positions (leader vs. follower) and the strategic \nimportance of collaborations within each parent firms\u2019 portfolios (core vs. peripheral business) \n(Lorange and Roos 1993).  Firms tend zealously to protect their core businesses and, are thus \nmore willing to enter alliances involving peripheral activities which offer wider scope for \norganizational learning and less vulnerability from sharing confidential information.  Lorange and \nRoos also offered examples of how large firms use joint ownership to restructure their poorly \nperforming business segments.  In such instances, the partnership generates instrumental value \nby allowing the dominant firm to undertake radical changes its portfolio\u2019s peripheral activities.   \n \nBusiness Environment Factors.  Alliance formation is broadly shaped by general economic \nconditions and the institutional frameworks in countries of operation, including legal \nrequirements, macro-economic policies, price controls, financial capital markets, distribution \nchannels, and methods of contract enforcement.  State regulatory activity affects firms\u2019 freedom \nto form business coalitions and joint ventures.  Thus, government intervention provides the \nmajor constraints and opportunities for strategic alliance formation.  Alliances often require \nformal approval by national governments, particularly in adhering to antimonopoly or antitrust \nregulations.  Likewise, some research and development (R&D) alliances originate as \ngovernment-funded projects that may include heavy state supervision. Tax incentives and \ninternational trade regimes established by foreign governments can also directly affect domestic \nfirms\u2019 decisions whether to enter into long-term overseas business relationships.   \n \nEmpirical researchers have conducted little comparative research explaining the impact of state \ninterventions on alliance formation.  Most investigations of state privatization and economic \nliberalization policies emphasized only the creation of general economic investment \n 8 \n \nopportunities, without ascertaining whether individual firms or strategic alliances were more \nlikely to seize such opportunities.  Unfortunately, regulation theorists remain steadily focused on \nmacro-level dynamics, while corporate governance researchers explore the strategic \nmanagement practices of individual corporations.  Thus, the meso-level is ripe for analytic \ndevelopment.  Another neglected researched area is private-sector partnerships with \ngovernment agencies.  Strategic collaborations with governments are in the business-press \nhype, particularly regarding large global infrastructure projects such as energy, water supply, or \ntelecom systems.  Particularly in less-developed countries, or in the defense sector in all \ncountries, government procurement, general funding, and other state initiatives are a major \nfactor in the proliferation of MNC alliances with local firms.  \n \nAnother country-specific systemic feature shaping coordinated action patterns is the complex \nset of relations among corporations, business associations, local and central governments, and \nelite universities.  Italian industrial districts are just one renown instance where historically \nrooted local business communities display dense interfirm relationships, based on simultaneous \ncompetition and cooperation, where alliance ties occur both within and extend well beyond the \ndistrict boundaries.  To explain this phenomenon, Mizruchi and Schwartz (1987) mentioned the \ndevelopment theory relationship between the structure of national business communities and \neconomic development.  Their core proposition is that businesses take distinct institutional \nforms at different stages of economic development.  Although cooperative ventures occur at all \ndevelopmental stages, business strategic alliances were a globalization phenomenon that \nemerged only after the Second World War.   \n \nTheorists generally recognize that firm responses to state regulatory interventions vary widely \nacross national cultures.  Two salient examples are the Korean chaebol and the Japanese \nkeiretsu, distinctive alliances forms that evolved from such traditional societal institutions as the \nextended family and the industrial cluster (Amin 1992; Gerlach 1992).  Another consensus is \nthat both multinational corporations and international strategic alliance networks usually seek to \novercome, circumvent, or subvert the regulatory mechanisms established by national \ngovernments (Dicken 1994).     \n \nIndustrial Factors.  The industrial context of alliances also exerts strong direct impacts on \ninterfirm relationships. The intensity of industry competition and the social organization of \nspecific product markets powerfully influences whether firm decide to internalize certain \nactivities, to compete for greater market share, to cooperate with other firms for particular \nstrategic advantages, or to internationalize by entering foreign markets.  The importance of \nindustrial contexts lies in how leading supply chains spread across different subsectors and \nwhich economic transactions occur among connected firms.  Extreme contrasts are industries \nwith long-established oligopolies or duopolies and industries with low barriers to entry and high \nrates of new firm creation.   \n \nIndustries may be classified along numerous dimensions, such as resource consumption levels, \ncapital investment, labor scarcity, knowledge intensity, and technological innovation.  This \nmultidimensionality means that potentially many industry factors drive organizational strategies \nin seeking alliances for comparative advantage.   \n \nAnalysts generally recognize that, due to technical or economic rationales, firms are more \nvulnerable when closely tied up to a dominant partner (e.g., Pennings 1994).  Technology plays \na significant role in setting organizational field boundaries and shaping internal structures.  \nAmong the competing technologies in a specific industry, some are core and leading while \nothers are supporting.  Rapid technological changes, or the abrupt emergence of a \n 9 \n \ncompetence-destroying technology, can radically restructure an entire organizational field\u2019s \ncompetitive and collaborative alignments.  The private and governmental sources of technology \nresearch funding, and R&D expenditure levels in general, differ markedly across industries.  \nCross-border technology alliances benefit directly from these differences.  In most national \neconomies, indirect subsidization takes place as governments fund R&D.   \n \nOrganizational Factors.  The diversity of organizations in an organizational field stems from \nsuch company-specific properties as their sizes, visible and tacit assets, collaborative histories, \nownership forms, corporate social capital networks, product ranges and diversification, market \nshares, and market penetration through distribution channels.  Given such diversity, \npropensities to participate in strategic alliances should vary across firms operating within the \nsame organizational field.  Corporate social capital influences alliance creation, as new ties \nbuild on existing interfirm relations (Walker, Kogut and Shan 1997; Gulati 1998:300).   \n    \nAlliance formation processes are also shaped by a dominant corporation (national or \nmultinational).  Dicken (1994) suggested that MNCs, with their complex headquarter-subsidiary \nrelationships, have established new foundations for business networks and multifirm alliances.  \nTherefore, the subunit coordination taking place inside an MNC provides a convenient blueprint \nfor coordinating complex alliance networks.  This dynamic is one reason why alliance analysts \ncan never resolve the debate over control and resource allocation processes.  Foreign investors \nfacilitate local companies\u2019 integration into global production and distribution chains, creating \nbusiness opportunities for local firms.  In addition, MNCs help to develop domestic markets, \ngenerate demand and competition, thereby restructuring existing relations within the markets \nthey penetrate.  However, studies of equity joint ventures make clear that huge discrepancies \noccur between the objectives of foreign and domestic firms.  Domestic firms typically seek \nopportunities to improve their export capabilities, while foreign firms desire greater access to the \nhost country\u2019s markets (Buckley and Casson 1988; Pan and Li 1998).  This tension over \nincompatible objectives, capabilities, and constraints among international joint venture partners \nis a crucial reason why partnering firms often seek equity controls to safeguard their alliance \nrisks.   \n \nA substantial difference between an MNC and a strategic alliance lies in the concept of shared \ncontrol.  Metaphorically, CEOs describe the alliance management problem by referring to the \nold logic of the octopus and the new logic of the network, where a different kind of \ninterdependence emerges (Lorange and Roos 1993).  The octopus symbolizes classical \nmanagement control from the center, while the network metaphor requires decentralized \norganizational structures and management processes to facilitate shared control.  Strategic \ninterdependence is one salient feature of successful alliances in dynamic markets (Sanchez \n1994).   \n \nGlobalization Drivers and Commodity Chains.  Market globalization transforms the nature of \ncorporate operations.  Competitive and strategic advantages now derive from companies\u2019 \ncapacities to cooperate with other firms; to form business networks with suppliers and buyers; to \nreap economies of scale; and to share costs and benefits with partners in geographically and \nculturally distant locations.  Globalization forces are among the key drivers forcing corporations \nto explore alternative ways of gaining and preserving competitive advantages.  These factors \ninclude: heightened competitive pressures on a global scale; shorter product life-cycles and \nrapid technological change; emergence of new competitors; personnel recruitment and \nplacement practices that extend corporate social capital across national boundaries; and \nincreased demand by global firms for systemic solutions.  Long-term strategies based on win-\nwin scenarios enable them to leverage their outputs for a broader commercial application across \n 10 \n \ndifferent locations and market segments (Lorange and Roos 1993).  According to Zajac\u2019s survey \nof MNC leaders, strategic alliances were considered a viable alternative to mergers and \ninternalization strategies by the majority of respondents (Zajac 1990).   \n \nTraditional global commodity chains are producer-driven and comprised of four segments: raw \nmaterial supply network, production network, export network, and marketing network (Gereffi \n1990).  Each segment and the entire commodity chain consists of interlinked firms, representing \nan input-output structure with spatial dispersion and concentration of units, and a governance \nstructure to coordinate the entire production system (Gereffi 1994).  This governance form has \nmore linear ties and is based on repetitive transactions and long-term contracts where the \nproducers become push-factors moving their products towards the final retail market.  In \ncontrast, the buyer-driven chain has multiple backward and forward linkages and resembles a \nstrategic alliance structure with complex logistics pulled by the retail sector with buyer-driven \norders.  The selection of firms for such chains is very much determined by whether the \ncoordinator role is dominated by producers or buyers, and varies across industry contexts.  \nThus, the globalization of commodity chains has stimulated complex economies of scale and \nscope that foster increasing rates of strategic alliance formation.   \n \nThe Implementation of Strategic Alliances \n \nAlliance implementation issues include the choice of governance mechanisms, enhancing trust \nand reciprocity between partners, managing the integration of project staffs from different \norganizational cultures, and resolving conflicts that arise among partners with divergent \nexpectations about and contributions to their collaboration.   \n \nRelational Contracting.  Some firms engaging in repeated long-term transactions may attempt \nto use hierarchical governance forms to safeguard the specific assets that evolve during their \nexchanges (Haugland 1999).  Hierarchical governance mechanisms include empowering one \nfirm\u2019s decisions over another\u2019s; creating a neutral body with authority and power to control \nspecific issues; and implementing standard operating procedures within the alliance.  As an \nalternative to hierarchical governance, Haugland (1999) proposed that relational contracting \ncould counteract the uncertainties associated with arm\u2019s-length contracts.  Relational \ngovernance forms rely on such diverse coordination mechanisms as reciprocity norms, \ninterorganizational trust, and social capital embedded in multiplex exchanges and social \ninteractions.  As a theoretical perspective, the concord that implicitly underlies relational \ncontracting contrasts with the opportunism explicitly presumed in both agency theory and \ntransaction cost economics (Borsch 1994).  Relational contracting embraces not only \nunspecifiable terms and conditions in complex and open-ended contracts, but also collective \ninterorganizational strategies for eliminating rivalry through tacit coordination.  Pursuing a \ncollective strategy typically depends on unanticipated future conditions that cannot be explicitly \nwritten into formal contractual agreements.  Hence, successful strategies require basic trust, \nmutual understanding, unrestricted learning, and interorganizational knowledge-sharing to \nachieve a high level of joint decision making at both strategic and operational levels.  Doz, Olk \nand Ring (2000) operationalized these processes as \u201copen solicitation\u201d and \u201cseeking domain \nconsensus,\u201d where the relational partners continually elaborate on their mutual objectives, \ncapabilities, resources, and tasks.  Achieving a well-documented consensus would then serve \nas a foundation on which relationally contracted firms could subsequently announce and \nimplement a formal strategic alliance.  A central issue remains how best to manage the balance \nbetween interdependence and control, with the alternative strategic alliance governance forms \ndiscussed above serving as particularly important mechanisms for resolving conflicts and \npreserving the partners\u2019 relationship (Harrigan 1988a; Haugland 1999).  Social capital, in the \n 11 \n \nform of interpersonal and interorganizational trust, is indispensable to reducing the costs of \nnegotiations between partners.  Moreover, many analysts treat trust as both an alliance \noutcome variable and a predictor of alliance success (Olk and Earley 2000). \n \nManaging Alliance Formation.  Once organizations decide to form a strategic alliance, the \npartners face serious challenges of turning their good intentions into a viable enterprise at all \nlevels, from routine activities to strategic policies.  This implementation phase typically requires \nthat two autonomous firms pool some human resources and material assets; develop a practical \ngovernance structure with sufficient power and control; and learn how to cooperate for mutual \nbenefit.  The inevitable misunderstandings and conflicts arising in a collaborative undertaking \ndemand that partner firms and their employees master new management skills, especially \ncoping with complex lateral relationships spanning legally autonomous entities.  When two firms \nsimply attempt to work together according to an agreement, the clean authority lines of a \ncorporation hierarchy typically are supplanted with disorderly parallel command-and-report \nsystems.  The managers delegated by the partners to implement the joint project may be initially \nuncertain about who is really in control and possesses final decision making authority.  Careful \nattention must be paid to selecting staff and leaders for liaison management, \u201cthe required \ncontinual linkages among partners and between partners and the alliance\u201d (Mockler 1999:144).  \nCreating a formal separate subsidiary having its own board of directors and internal authority \nhierarchy, with equity stakes legally dividing ownership and control among the partners, may \nhelp to clarify the venture partners\u2019 ultimate rights and expectations vis-\u00e0-vis one another.  But, \neven the most meticulous contractual safeguards provide no guarantees against the \nuncertainties, ambiguities, and disputes that constantly surface during daily operations.  Several \nsocial control processes, such interorganizational trust, reciprocity, and confidence (Das and \nTeng 1998), loom large as mechanisms for sustaining alliances during their precarious \nimplementation phase.   \n \nGenerating trust among alliance participants is crucial to overcoming competitive rivals\u2019 initial \nsuspicions about possible partner opportunism, which may prevent effective implementation of \ntheir collaborative agreement.  Imbalances in organizational power, indicated by disparities in \nthe resources contributed and controlled by each partner organization, can impede trust \ncreation due to the partners\u2019 unequal capacities to fulfil their obligations (Goel 1994; Chaudhuri \n1995; Brousseau and Quelin 1996; Lin and Germain 1998).  Initial alliances among previously \ninexperienced partners (\u201cvirgin ties\u201d) often begin with formal contractual linkages that expose \nthe partners only to small risks.  Because both organizations still have few grounds for trusting \none another, equity-based contracts predominate as legal protections against potential \nopportunism (so-called \u201chostage-taking\u201d purportedly limits each firm\u2019s capacity to act in \ndisregard of the partner\u2019s interests).  Once both partners gain mutual confidence through \ncontinual testing, then \u201cinformal psychological contracts increasingly compensate or substitute \nfor formal contractual safeguards as reliance on trust among parties increases over time\u201d (Ring \nand Van de Ven 1994:105).  Repeated strategic alliances among experienced partners are \nmore likely to rely on interorganizational trust than on formal safeguards against potential \npartner opportunism.   \n \nPrior Alliances.  Using a 1980-89 panel of 166 corporations operating in three worldwide \nsectors (U.S., Japanese, and European new materials, industrial automation, and automotive \nproducts firms), Gulati (1995b) conducted event-history analyses on a variety of dyadic alliances \nranging from licensing agreements to closely intertwined equity joint ventures.  He found strong \nevidence that formal equity-sharing agreements decreased with the existence and frequency of \nprior ties to a partner.  Domestic alliances less often involved equity mechanisms than did \ninternational agreements, supporting claims that trust relations are more difficult to sustain \n 12 \n \ncross-culturally.  Strategically interdependent firms (i.e., companies operating in complementary \nmarket niches) formed alliances more often than did firms possessing similar resources and \ncapabilities.  Previously allied firms were more likely to engage in subsequent partnerships, \nsuggesting that over time, each firm acquired more information and built greater confidence in \nits partner.  However, beyond a certain point, additional alliances reduced the likelihood of \nfuture ties, perhaps reflecting fears of losing autonomy by becoming overly dependent on a \npartner.  (See also Walker, Kogut and Shan 1997; Gulati and Gargiulo 1999.)  Indirect \nconnections within the social network of prior alliances also shaped the alliance formation \nprocess: previously unconnected firms were more likely to ally if both were tied to a common \nthird-party, but their chances of partnering diminished with greater path distances.  Gulati \n(1995b: 644) concluded that \u201cthe social network of indirect ties is an effective referral \nmechanism for bringing firms together and that dense co-location in an alliance network \nenhances mutual confidence as firms become aware of the possible negative reputational \nconsequences of their own or others\u2019 opportunistic behavior.\u201d  His results reflected a logic of \nclique-like cohesion rather than status-competition among structurally equivalent organizations. \n  \nTrust and Reciprocity.  Andrea Larson\u2019s (1992) ethnographic exploration of dyadic alliances \nilluminated the role of trust and reciprocity norms during the alliance implementation phase.  \nShe conducted in-depth interviews in the mid-1980s with informants from seven partnerships \ncreated by four small entrepreneurial companies (a telephone distributor, a retail clothing \ncompany, a computer firm, and a manufacturer of environmental support systems).  Although \nmutual economic gain was a necessary incentive for an alliance to emerge, sustaining the \nrelationship required a trial period, lasting between six and 18 months, during which the partners \nincrementally built stable and predictable structures to govern their collaboration.  Key features \nof this critical trial phase were the institutionalization of implicit and explicit rules and \nprocedures, and the evolution of clear expectations that became taken-for-granted by managers \nin both companies.  As a relationship solidified over time, organizational actions grew more \nintegrated and mutually controlled through intertwined operational, strategic, and social \nmechanisms.   \n \nStrategic Alliances Outcomes  \n \nAlthough organizations form strategic alliances for diverse motives, and partners generally \nexpect to benefit from their collaboration, analysts encounter difficulties in untangling the impact \nof environmental, economic, organizational, and interorganizational factors on alliance \noutcomes and consequences.  Authors of \u201chow to\u201d guides typically trumpet the alleged positive \nconsequences of joint ventures and equity arrangements (e.g., Triantis 1999; Wolf 2000).  \nEmpirical researchers generally appear more pessimistic about partners\u2019 abilities to overcome \nthe inherent tensions between competition and cooperation to achieve lasting results.  For \nexample, Das and Teng (1998:493) observed that \u201cthe essentially fickle and tentative nature of \npartner cooperation should not be overlooked\u201d because it renders many strategic alliances \n\u201cfundamentally self-defeating, unstable, and transitional in nature\u201d (see also Inkpen and \nBeamish 1997).  Conceptual and measurement problems plague performance and productivity \nassessments, whether using objective outcome indicators (e.g., financial gains, innovations) or \nsubjective indicators (e.g., partner satisfaction with the collaboration).  Evaluating international \nalliances is especially complicated, because firms from different countries and cultures generally \napply divergent success criteria (Si and Bruton 1999; Yan and Zeng 1999).  Despite such \noperational difficulties, researchers have investigated a variety of factors affecting several \ndimensions of strategic alliance consequences.     \n \n 13 \n \nSurvival and Termination.  One difficulty in assessing performance outcomes is that most \ninterorganizational collaborations are intentionally short-lived affairs, designed to achieve only \nlimited purposes.  A fundamental performance question is, how long do strategic alliances \nsurvive beyond their formal announcement before eventual termination?  A collaborative \nagreement may terminate through complete project dissolution, either before or after achieving \nits formal objectives; by a joint venture\u2019s acquisition by one of its partners; or through an \norganizational merger of the parent firms.  Researchers have investigated several factors that \nmay affect the survival rates and end states of various types of alliances.   \n \nMost analysts found high levels of strategic alliance instability and dissolution, with failure rates \napproaching 50 percent (Harrigan 1988b; Kogut 1988; Dacin, Hitt and Levitas 1997).  Alliances \nin the technologically volatile telecommunication industry exhibit an \u201calarming tendency to fall \napart due to fickle behavior of members\u201d (Curwen 1999:141).  Bleeke and Ernst (1993) used \nunpublished reports and interviews with insiders of top companies in the U.S., Europe and \nJapan to determine that, among 49 cross-border alliances, 51 percent were successful for both \npartners while 33 percent resulted in failure for both.  Success meant that the partners achieved \ntheir own strategic objectives and recovered their financial capital costs.  An event history \nanalysis of 186 joint ventures among U.S. and Japanese electronics firms between 1979-1988 \nfound a 43 percent dissolution rate, with an average life span of less than five years (Park and \nUngson 1997). International joint ventures are purportedly more vulnerable to \nmisunderstandings arising from incompatible national and corporate cultures, resulting in high \nmanagerial conflicts and early terminations (see also Lin and Germain 1998; Simonin 1999; \nSteensma and Lyles 2000).  However, contrary to expectations, Park and Ungson found that \nU.S.-Japanese electronics joint ventures lasted longer and were less likely to dissolve than \ndomestic alliances between American firms.   \n \nAnalysts disagree whether project acquisition, or the internalization of a joint venture by one of \nthe partners, should be treated as an alliance failure or a successful realization of the acquiring \norganization\u2019s personnel and capital investments.  The widespread assumption that instability is \nequivalent to collaborative failure may be inaccurate.  Data on 272 terminated IJVs revealed \nfrequent equity transfers between the parent firms, reflecting the ultimate owner\u2019s strategic \nintentions from the start of the venture (Reuer 1997).  More than 80 percent of the international \nalliances studied by Bleeke and Ernst ended in acquisitions, usually by the stronger partner \n(1995:97).  Among the important factors explaining this outcome were firm size, frequency of \ninterorganizational communication, board of directors power, the relative size of partner \ncontributions, and inequalities in distributing the benefits produced by the partnership.   \n \nA complete merger between organizations represents an extreme outcome of a strategic \nalliance.  Partnerships may serve as a transitional phase (\u201ccourtship\u201d) in which potential mates \nexplore the feasibility of fusing their identities into a new enterprise.  By enabling two courting \norganizations to observe one another\u2019s business activities from the inside, alliances familiarize \ntop managers with both corporate cultures and reveal the potential for performance \nimprovements by combining operations (Nanda and Williamson 1995).  However, Hagedoorn \nand Sadowski (1999) argued that transitions from strategic technology alliances to acquisitions \nand mergers rarely occur.  Just 2.6 percent of 6,425 alliances from 1970-1993 could be directly \nlinked to such transformations.  The authors concluded that strategic technology partnering is a \ndistinct mode of governance which is unconnected to subsequent merger (for other views of this \nsector\u2019s dynamics, see Hennart and Reddy 1997; Jamison 1998).   \n \nAchieving Learning Objectives.  Many organizations enter alliances with great anticipation \nabout learning from their partners, whether as the primary goal or as a derivative of other \n 14 \n \nobjectives, such as creating new products and technologies or penetrating into new markets.  \nOrganizational learning occurs when a firm acquires, assimilates, and applies new information, \nknowledge, and skills that enhance its long-run performance and competitive advantage.  \nStrategic alliances can operate as institutionalized channels for transferring and creating new \norganizational capacities.  Learning may occur either through exploitation as one organization \nacquires another\u2019s know-how, or through common experience as partners learn synergically \nwhile implementing a collaborative agreement (Tsang 1999).  The first dynamic connotes \ncompetition, while the latter process implies greater mutuality and interdependence.  Factors \nshaping basic organizational learning capacity include \u201cthe nature of the shared business \nactivity, the type of knowledge jointly developed, and the firm\u2019s reward system\u201d (Lei, Slocum and \nPitts 1997:210).   \n \nAlthough substantial organizational enlightenment may occur through vicarious learning and \nimitation of a more sophisticated partner, R&D collaborations typically require mutual \nexperiential learning activities to synthesize original knowledge, which then becomes the \nventure owners\u2019 joint intellectual property.  Whether organizational learning involves acquiring \nroutine or extraordinary knowledge, transaction cost analysts caution that alliance participants \nrisk potential opportunism from their partner\u2019s unrestricted access to proprietary secrets and \npatented processes.  Repeated collaborations enhance mutual learning experiences as \ninterorganizational trust emerges to substitute for formal protections against the fear of being \nripped off.  A study of 212 alliances in six manufacturing and service industries found that higher \nlevels of relational capital (social capital based on trust, respect and friendship) and integrative \nconflict resolution mechanisms (ensuring fairness and procedural justice) increased both \ncorporate learning and protection of proprietary assets (Kale, Singh and Perlmutter 2000).   \n \nOrganizational success in achieving alliance learning objectives depends on several dimensions \nof knowledge and organizational structure.  In particular, both organizations\u2019 absorptive \ncapacities--their interwoven human resources, finance capital, social capital, and organizational \nbelief systems--constrain their effective information processing, acquisition of partner expertise, \nand adoption of innovations.  In a survey with high-tech firms, the most significant determinant \nof knowledge transferability was tacitness, defined as knowledge \u201cwhich cannot be easily \ncommunicated and shared, is highly personal and deeply root in action and in an individual\u2019s \ninvolvement with a specific context\u201d (Simonin 1999:469).  Moreover, the impacts of partner \ncultural distance, asset specificity, and past experience on knowledge ambiguity were \nmoderated by alliance duration, firm size, and collaborative experience.  An exploratory study of \nnetwork formation in 53 R&D consortia (Doz, Olk and Ring 2000) found that tacit learning was \nmore strongly connected to similar interests of the partners, and was unrelated to solicitation \nand consensus-seeking processes during the alliance formation period.  Thus, the partners\u2019 \nattitudes and needs had stronger influence on their learning capabilities than did their \ninteractions prior to entering the alliance.   \n \nCase studies of learning in specific industries have also identified factors that aid or thwart \ninnovation and knowledge transfer among alliance partners.  Embedded internal constraints on \nknowledge exchange and organizational learning, arising from the firms\u2019 incompatible \norganizational structures and corporate cultures, ultimately doomed collaboration among \nunequals.   \n \nAlliance Impacts on Partners.   Apart from the immediate outcomes of formal collaborative \nactivities, strategic alliances may also affect the partnering organizations\u2019 performances and \nsurvival chances.  Some analysts seek to link alliance characteristics to various firm economic \nindicators such as stock prices, profits, productivity, market shares.  A more difficult task is to \n 15 \n \ndemonstrate that alliances produce substantial non-financial, or transformational, outcomes \nsuch as enhanced organizational credibility (Human and Provan 1997).  For example, do firms \ninvolved in certain types of collaborations gain in perceived legitimacy, trustworthiness, and \nreputation for quality within their organizational fields?  A considerable empirical problem is how \nto detect the consequences of relatively small alliances for their much large parent \norganizations.   \n \nOne outcome hypothesis attracting recent research attention is that strategic alliances \ncontribute to superior production performance by the parents.  Research on 142 Canadian \nbiotechnology startup firms from 1991-1996 found that their initial performances were enhanced \nby establishing alliance networks that provided access to \u201cdiverse information and capabilities \nwith minimum costs of redundancy, conflict, and complexity,\u201d gave more opportunities to learn \nfrom established rivals, but avoided risky intra-alliance rivalries (Baum, Calabrese and \nSilverman 2000:287).  In particular, the startups\u2019 alliance networks boosted their innovativeness \nas measured by rates of patenting and R&D growth.  A comparative study of alliance networks \namong 138 steel and 130 semiconductor firms from 1990-1994 found that the influence of \nnetwork characteristics on firm performance varied with industry contexts (Rowley, Behrens and \nKrackhardt 2000).   \n \nIn another analysis of semiconductor firms from 1985-1991, Stuart (2000) investigated the \nimpact of alliances on innovation rates and economic growth.  He measured innovation as the \nnumber of patents granted and growth as annual semiconductor sales.  The crucial factors were \nnot the size of each firm\u2019s alliance portfolio (number of alliances formed during the previous five \nyears), but the resource profiles of its partners.  Specifically, both innovation and sales rates \nincreased substantially if a firm was connected to more technologically innovative and revenue-\nrich alliance partners.  These effects were especially potent for younger and smaller firms. An \nimportant implication of Stuart\u2019s analysis is that firms derive advantage from their partners\u2019 \ncorporate social capital, even if their strategic alliance fails to achieve its professed formal \nobjectives.  Again we see that defining alliance success and failure is fraught with ambiguities.   \n \nAnother basic outcome hypothesis is that a strategic alliance increases a firm\u2019s equity value if \nthe collaboration enhances the parent organizations\u2019 competitive advantages.  Firms that \ntransfer proprietary knowledge and pool specialized resources and employee skills into a joint \nR&D project sometimes achieve technological breakthroughs with widespread product \napplications that yield market windfalls for all partners.  Several investigations uncovered \npositive impacts of alliances on corporate shareholder value.  The average stock price response \nwas positive on the day of announcements for 345 nonequity strategic alliances by 460 most \nhigh-tech firms from 1983-1992 (Chan, Kensinger, Keown and Martin 1997).  Among alliances \nbetween firms within same industry, a bigger stock price jump occurred for technical than for \nmarketing agreements, suggesting \u201cthat partnering firms from the same industry can better take \nadvantage of technological complementarities\u201d (p. 213).   \n \nIn contrast to robust research on the financial consequences of alliances for partner \norganizations, studies of noneconomic outcomes are relatively rarer.  Typical subjective \nmeasures include informant ratings of performance and subjective satisfaction with the alliance \npartner.  For example, Sim and Ali (1998) found higher success ratings with past joint venture \nexperience and greater cooperation.  Saxton (1997) found that perceptions of initial and overall \nrelationship satisfaction increased with higher partner reputation for management quality; with \ngreater shared strategic decision making; and with greater strategic fit or similarities between \nthe partners.  However, a prior partnership with another firm was linked only to initial satisfaction \nbut not to longer term alliance benefits. Continued partnering reflects inertia or \n 16 \n \ninstitutionalization \u201cas opposed to a reflection of mutual trust and commitment\u201d (Saxton, 1997: \n455).  Among negative consequences of alliance networks researchers identify the effect of \nsocial embeddedness on market efficiencies by locking partners into unproductive relations or \nblocking collaboration with other viable firms, and \u201crigidity in changing order levels and trading \npartners [and] potential lack of market stimulus.\u201d  (Gulati, Nohria & Zaheer 2000, Sako \n(1992:239).   \n \nSocietal Consequences.  Researchers have paid least attention to the impacts of strategic \nalliances on the larger social systems in which they are embedded.  Economists have sounded \ntheoretical alarms about the increased anticompetitive consequences of cooperative endeavors, \nwarning that partnerships can hinder efficient production, restrict market access, and reduce \neconomic competition (Carlton and Salop 1995).  In particular, multiple recurrent R&D projects \namong members of an alliance network may create opportunities for collusion by firms that \nsimultaneously compete across multiple product markets (Vonortas 2000).  Although alliance \nparticipation by foreign firms in domestic industries may safeguard against anticompetitive \nbehavior, domestic firms sometimes set up joint ventures precisely to deter market entry (Zhao \n1999).  An alliance between an incumbent airline with excess capacity and an entrant to share \nexpensive facilities at lower costs can appear efficient and competitive, but \u201cmay be made to \ndiscourage the entrant from building its own facility and entering at a larger, more competitive \nscale\u201d (Chen and Ross 2000:328).  By reducing the total capacity that might otherwise be \nconstructed (thus keeping consumer prices higher through restricting supply), anticompetitive \narrangements can reduce societal welfare even when the alliance partners do not directly \ncompete.  Negative impacts may be especially flagrant where multinational firms use joint \nventures with local firms as strategic devices to penetrate developing nations.   \n \nSimilar qualms concern greater concentration within industries arising from the competitive \nadvantages achieved by R&D alliances compared to firms that independently pursue R&D \ninnovations.  The superior economic efficiencies accruing to R&D alliance members may \nparadoxically contribute to less-competitive outcomes at the industry level, with consumers \nagain paying higher prices.  If alliance networks lead to concentration of R&D funding within an \nindustry, rates of innovation may fall in the absence of competitors to spur exertions forward.   \n \nConclusions and Future Directions \n \nStrategic alliances are more than simple instrumental means for achieving collective goals \ndirectly benefiting the collaborators.  They also constitute each partner firms\u2019 corporate social \ncapital, providing potential access to various assets controlled by other strategic alliance \nnetwork members. Alliances provide opportunities for participants to tap into the resources, \nknowledge, and skills of their immediate partners in a portfolio of inter-firm agreements.  \nFurther, given latent reachability across strong ties and possibilities for activating brokerage \nefforts to interconnect the partners of partners, these complex patterns of social capital \nembedded within an organizational field-net of a strategic alliance offer enormous potential for \nsignificantly leveraging its member firms\u2019 resource capabilities. Theoretical conjectures and \nempirical investigations of strategic alliances over the past two decades reveal an accelerating \nproliferation of these interorganizational phenomena.  Arm\u2019s-length market exchanges may \nprove less efficient than alternative interfirm arrangements for carrying out many complex co-\nproduction processes, such as R&D on highly uncertain technologies, as well as for overcoming \nlegal-political-cultural barriers to cross-national transactions. Current debates over the \nglobalization of business systems emphasize how both local and international environments \nfoster international joint venture partnerships, but these environments may also inhibit the full \nrealization of benefits obtainable through such relationships.  The images of mixed advantages \n 17 \n \nand drawbacks accruing from collaborative enterprises reflect the current ambiguous state of \nknowledge about strategic alliance networks and their multidimensional consequences.   \n \nPartner selection comprises the largest and richest body of empirical research.  It seeks to \nexplain who collaborates with whom, at what rates, for how long, and deploying what \ngovernance forms (especially equity or nonequity ownership of joint enterprises).  An important \nsubset focuses on IJVs, with their added complexity of diverse cross-national cultures and legal-\ngovernmental systems.  Analysis of alliance formation processes should feature more explicit \ncontingency perspectives that explicitly identify how variations in business systems, industries, \nstrategic alliance networks (organizational field nets), markets, and organizational attributes \ncondition participation opportunities and organizational perceptions of collaborative efficacy.  \nWe also urge more study of innovative dynamics occurring at the strategic alliance network \nlevel; that is, not by examining the creation of new products and technologies, but explaining \nhow tie-formation processes subsequently feedback to transform the global network structure \nitself.  Some other fundamental questions whose conditional elaboration could be profitably \npursued include:   \n \nSimilarity versus complementarity in partner choice:  If strategic alliances are primarily \nabout gaining access to useful resources not possessed by an organization, then collaborating \nwith complementary strengths and weaknesses presumably yields larger payoffs than affiliating \nwith highly similar peers.  But, which organizational attributes hold the keys to a more perfect \nunion and under what conditions?  Products, market positions, technologies, human resources, \nmanagerial styles, or more intangible elements such as reputation and institutional thought \npatterns?  Perhaps curvilinear relationships are more plausible. \n \nRegarding the issue of cultural distance a relevant question is whether particular nations have \nspecific cultural codes, equivalent to the trust-based cooperative norms of Japanese society, \nthat foster and sustain higher cross-national collaboration rates?  Researchers also recognize a \nstrong tendency for partners to repeat their alliances over time, but the conditions favoring \npersistence and desistence aren\u2019t fully understood.  Brokerage processes, involving third-party \nintroductions and vetting, are crucial social mechanisms for forging new ties between \nunacquainted organizations.  But, more needs to be learned about the characteristics and \nconditions favoring successful as well as failed match-making.  The complementarity principle \nsuggests that brokers will perform better if they serve to connect somewhat disparate, rather \nthan highly similar, partners.     \n \nNetwork patterns and processes:  Organizational field nets typically exhibit internally \ndifferentiated but malleable structures, with some actors occupying more central locations and \ncontrolling access to information and resources.  Researchers can apply network principles to \ninvestigate important questions about alliance formation processes across several levels of \nanalysis.  At the micro-level of a firm, how do individual organizations\u2019 varied positions within the \nstrategic alliance network facilitate or impede the construction of more diverse portfolios?  \nAmong the several alternative centrality conceptualizations, which measures yield greater \nexplanatory accuracy in predicting new and repeat alliances?  At the macro-level of a complete \nfield-net, how do changes in various structural dimensions alter alliance formation rates over \ntime?  Most intriguing, what cross-level conditional effects occur, involving interactions among \nfirm attributes, ego-centric positions, and complete networks on collaborative dynamics?   \n \nFusion or fission:  Not all alliances are intentionally designed to achieve mutually beneficial \noutcomes for all parties.  Some organizations may enter strategic alliances as cautious, lower-\nrisk pathways for exploring opportunities for subsequent mergers, takeovers, or business-unit \n 18 \n \ndivestitures.  Researchers need a deeper understanding of conditions promoting such \nmanipulative behavior, with or without partner consent, and how such arrangements differ from \ncollaborations intended to preserve partner autonomy.  When are firms more disposed to form \ntemporary alliances for controlled risk-assessment prior to taking the plunge into full-fledged \ncorporate fusion or fission?   \n \nDevelopmental Dynamics: The period after an alliance announcement, from implementation to \ntermination, is less thoroughly investigated.  Analysts routinely stress the importance of trust as \na crucial form of corporate social capital important to overcoming awkwardness and potential \nconflicts while partners attempt to turn their plans into practices.  Power dynamics also come \ninto play as project managers negotiate the practical allocation of authority, property rights, \nmanagement responsibilities, and division of rewards or losses from the undertaking.  We have \nlittle information about immanent failures during initial attempts to implement a formal \nagreement.  What conditions lead to the abrupt breakdown of negotiations and discourage \nfurther efforts to relaunch a new partnership?  Organizational researchers have conducted too \nfew ethnographic studies to comprehend the full range of patterns and problems encountered \nby real alliance participants.  What institutional, relational, and organizational features of a \nstrategic alliance network push projects along increasingly cooperative or hostile trajectories?  \nIn the absence of hierarchical controls, are agents\u2019 personal attributes or organizations\u2019 \nstructural features more important for sustaining corporate trust and implementing quality \nworking relations?  What measures of absorptive capacity could enable researchers to test \nmany interesting theoretical hypotheses about knowledge transfers between partners and \nlearning processes occurring within projects?  Organizational sociology needs more detailed \nexplorations of alliance termination dynamics, particularly whether amicable or unpleasant \nconclusions produce lingering impacts for subsequent attempts to collaborate with the same or \nnew partners.   \n \nPerformance Outcomes: An impressive literature has accumulated about the performance \noutcomes of alliances and the parent organizations.  Some empirical studies suggest that most \ncollaborations are relatively short-lived, with many failing to achieve their formal objectives of \nR&D innovation, organizational learning, or foreign-market penetration.  Other evidence \nindicates that the parent organizations often derive significant performance benefits, such as \nstock price boosts and sales growth following alliance announcements.  This mixed evidence \napparently has not dampened the accelerating reliance on strategic alliance, especially among \nglobal businesses.  Analysts should increasingly disentangle the relative impacts of \norganizational, relational, and environmental contexts on various performance measures.  \nTheorists could construct more nuanced specifications of detailed social mechanisms that \nconditionally influence outcomes in strategic alliance networks.  For example, which formal \ngovernance structures interact with what organizational components to boost learning and \nknowledge transfer?  How does the corporate social capital embedded in interfirm trust relations \ncombine with social norms emerging from a collaboration to shape the distribution of outcome \nrewards among the partners?  Finally, because analysts have paid so little attention to the \nunintended consequences of proliferating alliances at the societal and international levels, \nresearchers have much to scrutinize.   \n \nIn conclusion, organizational sociology\u2019s collective understanding of the social organization and \ndynamics of strategic alliance behavior has come far over the past two decades.  But, as this \nsection indicates, we still have many more questions than answers.  Fortunately, numerous \nopportunities abound for collaborative theorizing and analysis.   \n \n \n 19 \n \nReferences \n \nAgarwal, S. and S. Ramaswami.
