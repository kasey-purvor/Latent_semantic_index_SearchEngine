We call \ud44b a dynamic bridge, because its terminal value \ud44d1\nis not known in advance. We compute explicitly its semimartingale decomposition under both\nits own filtration \u2131\ud44b and the filtration \u2131\ud44b,\ud44d jointly generated by \ud44b and \ud44d. Our construction is\nheavily based on parabolic PDE\u2019s and filtering techniques.

This construction will be performed adding a well-chosen drift to\na suitable Brownian martingale corresponding to \ud435. Such a drift will be a nonlinear function of \ud44d\ud461\nand \ud44b\ud461.

We called\nsuch a process a dynamic Markov bridge because it is Markov and especially because its terminal\nvalue is not fixed in advance but it is dynamic itself, being the terminal value of the process \ud44d.\nThis construction is obtained in Theorem 2.1, which is the main result of the mathematical part of\nthe paper.\nThis study has a two-fold motivation, probabilistic and financial. First, the purely probabilistic\none: in the paper by Fo\u00a8llmer et al. [11], a thorough investigation of this problem has been done\nin the case \ud44e \u2261 \ud70e \u2261 1, where \ud44d as well as \ud44b are Gaussian processes. More precisely, they studied\nsolutions \ud44b of SDE\u2019s \ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 + \ud6fc\ud461\ud451\ud461, where \ud6fc\ud461 depends linearly on \ud44b and \ud44d = \ud6fd. They obtain\na characterization of such linear drifts \ud6fc\ud461 making \ud44b a Brownian motion in its own filtration in\nterms of Volterra kernels solutions to some integral equations, that can be reduced in some special\ncase to a Sturm-Liouville equation. Fo\u00a8llmer et al. were in turn motivated by the following natural\nmodification of the classical Brownian bridge dynamics\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n\ud6fd\ud461 \u2212\ud44b\ud461\n1\u2212 \ud461 \ud451\ud461\nwhere in the drift \ud6fd\ud461 replaces \ud6fd1 as in the classical \u201cstatic\u201d Brownian bridge. It has been shown\nin [11] that \ud44b is still a bridge in the sense that \ud44b1 = \ud6fd1 but it is not a Brownian motion in its\nown filtration anymore. They then focused more on general linear drifts preserving the Brownian\nproperty. Considering only linear drifts allows them to use the nice and powerful relation between\nGaussian processes and Volterra kernels. Few questions naturally arise from that work: What\nhappens if the signal \ud44d is not necessarily Gaussian? Is it still possible to construct a \u201cdynamic\u201d\nbridge \ud44b with the required properties? It turns out that it is still possible, but using completely\ndifferent techniques. Indeed, \ud44d being not Gaussian anymore, one is lead to consider nonlinear drifts\nto build the bridge, which makes impossible the use of Gaussian processes theory. However, the\nMarkov nature of the problem allows us to use techniques from parabolic PDEs and those from\nfiltering theory in order to carry out our analysis.\nThe second motivation \u2013 that we share with Fo\u00a8llmer et al. [11] \u2013 is a financial one: The dynamic\nbridge \ud44b is the solution of a Kyle-Back type equilibrium model of a gradually informed insider\ntrading (see [2] for initial information and [3, 23, 9] for the dynamic information case). In such a\nmodel, the insider observes a signal process (unknown to the market) \ud44d as above with \ud44e \u2261 1 driven\nby the Brownian motion \ud6fd. She applies a well-chosen drift, modelling her strategy, to the Brownian\nmotion \ud435 in such a way that (i) the resulting process\ud44b ends up in \ud44d1 and (ii) the distribution of the\nprocess remains unchanged, i.e. \ud44b is again a Brownian motion in its own filtration. Condition (i)\nguarantees that the strategy maximizes the insider\u2019s expected gain. On the other hand, condition\n(ii) means that the strategy of the insider, i.e. the drift, is \u201cinconspicuous\u201d, and this corresponds\nto the notion of equilibrium as defined in [2, 3]. The reader is referred once more to the papers\n[2, 3, 23, 9] for more financial as well as mathematical details. Our probabilistic construction of\nthe dynamic bridge \ud44b leads to an interesting generalization of such a model, where the signal\nmodelling insider\u2019s dynamic information is not necessarily Gaussian. Even in this more general\nframework, we are able to give an explicit solution for the equilibrium total demand and optimal\ninsider\u2019s strategy in our main result of the financial part of the paper, Theorem 5.1. Interestingly,\nthe existence of a solution for insider\u2019s maximization problem imposes a very precise structure on\nthe form of the signal volatility \ud44e(\ud461, \ud44d\ud461) (see Section 5), resulting in the insider\u2019s signal being a\nfunction of a Gaussian process. This seems to indicate that a non-trivial generalization beyond a\n2\nGaussian setting is impossible. Nonetheless, we would like to stress the fact that while the financial\napplication forces the signal to be \u2018almost-Gaussian\u2019 as explained in Remark 5.5, the construction\nwe perform in Section 2 is much more general, since it includes signals which are not necessarily\nGaussian.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains the motivation and formal definition of\nsuch a bridge. A new proof of Gaussian bridge construction is given in Section 3, while in the\nSection 4 the general construction is proved. At the end of this section, we also give an application\nof our result to build an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge. Finally, in Section 5 we shortly introduce the\nfinancial model and we apply the main result contained in Section 2 to find the equilibrium total\ndemand and optimal insider\u2019s strategy.\n2 Formulation of the problem and some auxiliary results\nLet (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) be a filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions. Note that we do\nnot require \ud4a20 to be trivial. Assume that on this probability space there exist two independent\nstandard Brownian motions, \ud435 and \ud6fd, and a random variable \ud44d0 in \ud4a20, which implies that \ud44d0 is\nindependent from \ud435 and \ud6fd.\nLet \ud4b5 = (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461), (\ud44d\ud461), (\ud443 \ud467)\ud467\u2208\u211d) be a diffusion process with values in \u211d. Here we are using the\nformulation of a Markov process as given in, e.g., Blumenthal and Getoor [7] or Sharpe [21]. Time\nvaries in the finite interval [0, 1]. We will use the notation \u211d+ for [0,\u221e) and \u2131\ud44c\ud461 for \ud70e(\ud44c\ud460; \ud460 \u2264 \ud461)\nfor any (possibly, vector-valued) stochastic process \ud44c .\nWe further assume that \ud44d is the unique strong solution on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) of\n\ud451\ud44d\ud461 = \ud70e(\ud461)\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud44d\ud461)\ud451\ud6fd\ud461, \ud461 \u2208 (0, 1], (2.1)\nwith \ud44d0 \u2208 \ud4a20 being a random variable with distribution, \ud707, and where \ud70e : [0, 1] 7\u2192 \u211d+ is a\ndeterministic function, \ud449 (\ud461) := \ud450 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud70e\n2(\ud460) \ud451\ud460 for some constant \ud450 > 0, and \ud44e : [0, 1] \u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d\nis regular enough for ensuring the existence of a unique strong solution. Moreover, \ud70e, \ud449 and\n\ud44e are required to satisfy further regularity conditions precise statements of which are given in\nAssumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 below.\nThe rest of this section will be devoted to the construction of a process \ud44b and a probability\nmeasure \ud707 on \u211d satisfying the following three conditions:\nC1 For every \ud447 < 1, \ud44b is the unique strong solution of the SDE\n\ud44b\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460)\ud451\ud435\ud460 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud6fc(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud460, for \ud461 \u2208 (0, \ud447 ]\nfor some Borel measurable real valued function \ud6fc. Moreover, (\ud44b,\ud44d) is a Markov process. More\nprecisely, (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461), (\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461), (\ud443 \ud465,\ud467)(\ud465,\ud467)\u2208\u211d2) is a Markov process with values in \u211d2 endowed\nwith its Borel \ud70e-algebra, with an initial distribution given by \ud6ff0 \u2297 \ud707 where \ud6ff0 is the Dirac\nmeasure at 0.\nC2 lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 exists \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s. and \ud44b1 := lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44d1, \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s..\nC3 (\ud44b\ud461)\ud461\u2208[0,1] is a local martingale in its own filtration.\n3\nRemark 2.1 In view of Theorem 8.1 in [16] the condition C3 implies that \ud44b, if exists, will be a\ndiffusion process with diffusion coefficient \ud44e and no drift in its own filtration. As C2 is also in place\nthis diffusion process will be conditioned to hit \ud44d1 at time 1. If we have allowed \ud44b to be adapted\nto the filtration generated by \ud44d1 and \ud435 such a process can be obtained using the available theory\nof \u2018static\u2019 Markov bridges (see, e.g., [10] and Proposition 37 in [5]) with a drift \ud6fc(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d1) since\n\ud44d1 and \ud435 are independent. However, the condition C1 stipulates that \ud44b should be adapted to the\nfiltration generated by the independent processes \ud44d and \ud435. This forces us to develop a theory of\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 Markov bridges as we will describe in the subsequent sections.\nRemark 2.2 The main difficulty with the construction of the process \ud44b is that all the conditions\nC1-C3 have to be met simultaneously. To illustrate this point consider the simple case \ud44e = \ud70e = 1.\nIf one allows the drift, \ud6fc, in condition C1 to depend on \ud44d1, then\n\ud44b\ud461 = \ud435\ud461 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44d1 \u2212\ud44b\ud460\n1\u2212 \ud460 \ud451\ud460 (2.2)\nhas a unique strong solution over [0, 1) and its solution can be continuously extended to the full\ninterval [0, 1] since conditioned on \ud44d1 = \ud467 this is the SDE for a Brownian bridge from 0 to \ud467 over\nthe interval [0, 1]. This is a Markovian bridge conditioned to hit \ud44d1 at \ud461 = 1 and, moreover, it is a\nmartingale in its own filtration (see expression (10) and the discussion after it in [11]).\nIf we replace \ud44d1 with \ud44d\ud461 in the above formulation we obtain the SDE\n\ud44b\ud461 = \ud435\ud461 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44d\ud460 \u2212\ud44b\ud460\n1\u2212 \ud460 \ud451\ud460\nwhich has a unique strong solution which satisfies C1 and C2 (see Lemma 2.1 in [11]). However,\n\ud44b does not satisfy C3 (see Lemma 2.2 in [11]).\nOne is also tempted to think that a projection of the solution of (2.2) onto the filtration generated\nby \ud44b and \ud44d could give us the construction that we seek. Note that the solution of (2.2) is adapted\nto the filtration (\u2131\ud435,\ud44d\ud461 ) enlarged with \ud44d1. In this enlarged filtration \ud44d has the decomposition\n\ud44d\ud461 = \ud6fd\u00af\ud461 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44d1 \u2212 \ud44d\ud460\n1\u2212 \ud460 \ud451\ud460\nwhere \ud6fd\u00af is a standard Brownian motion adapted to this filtration (see Theorem 3 in Chap. VI of\n[19]) and independent of \ud435. Comparison of the SDEs for \ud44b and \ud44d reveals an inherent symmetry\nof these two processes. Thus, the semimartingale decomposition of these two processes with respect\nto (\u2131\ud44b,\ud44d\ud461 ) should have a symmetric structure, in particular if one is a martingale with respect to\n(\u2131\ud44b,\ud44d\ud461 ) so is the other. However, this is inconsistent with the structural assumptions we have on\n\ud44b and \ud44d which are manifested in C1 and (2.1).\nThese examples, in particular the last one, demonstrate that the solution to our problem cannot\nbe obtained via a combination of available enlargement of filtration and nonlinear filtering tech-\nniques.\nWe would like to stress here that the functions \ud70e and \ud449 that appeared in the dynamics of \ud44d play a\ncrucial role in the existence of the solution of the problem above. Indeed, suppose that \ud70e \u2261 1 and\n\ud449 (\ud461) = \ud461 for each \ud461 \u2265 0, and \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) is regular enough to ensure the existence of a square integrable\n4\nnon-constant solution to (2.1). Suppose that there exists a solution to the problem defined by\nconditions C1-C3. Consider the probability measure \u2119 defined on (\u03a9,\u2131\ud44b1 \u2228 \u2131\ud44d1 ) by\n\u2119(\ud438) =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud443 0,\ud467(\ud438)\ud707(\ud451\ud467), \u2200\ud438 \u2208 \u2131\ud44b1 \u2228 \u2131\ud44d1 .\nNote that \ud44b1 = \ud44d1, \ud443\n0,\ud467-a.s. for every \ud467 \u2208 \u211d implies that \ud44b1 = \ud44d1,\u2119-a.s., therefore, for any\nbounded measurable function \ud453 ,\n\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d1)] = \ud53c[\ud453(\ud44b1)] (2.3)\nwhere \ud53c is the expectation operator with respect to \u2119. One one hand,\n\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d1)] = \ud53c[\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\ud44d0]] =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud438\ud443\n\ud467\n[\ud453(\ud44d1)]\ud707(\ud451\ud467) =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud466)\ud45d(\ud467, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 \ud707(\ud451\ud467)\nwhere \ud45d(\ud467, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 = \ud443 \ud467(\ud44d1 \u2208 \ud451\ud466). On the other hand, conditions C1 and C3 imply that\n\ud44b\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460)\ud451\ud435\n\ud44b\n\ud460\nfor some Brownian motion \ud435\ud44b adapted to \u2131\ud44b . Comparing this to (2.1) we see that the law of \ud44b\ud461\nis that of \ud44d\ud461 conditioned on \ud44d0 = 0 for any \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1]. Therefore,\n\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44b1)] =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud466)\ud45d(0, \ud466) \ud451\ud466. (2.4)\nLet \ud453(\ud466) = \ud452\ud456\ud45f\ud466. Then, in view of (2.3) we have\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud452\ud456\ud45f\ud466\ud45d(0, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud452\ud456\ud45f\ud466\ud45d(\ud467, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 \ud707(\ud451\ud467)\n=\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud452\ud456\ud45f\ud466\n(\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud45d(\ud467, \ud466)\ud707(\ud451\ud467)\n)\n\ud451\ud466.\nNote that the interchange of integrals is justified since \u2223\ud452\ud456\ud45f\ud466\ud45d(\ud467, \ud466)\u2223 < \ud45d(\ud467, \ud466) and \u222b\u211d \u222b\u211d \ud45d(\ud467, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 \ud707(\ud451\ud467) =\n1. This implies that the characteristic functions of the measures \ud45d(0, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 and\n(\u222b\n\u211d \ud45d(\ud467, \ud466)\ud707(\ud451\ud467)\n)\n\ud451\ud466\nare the same. We can assume, without substantial loss of generality, that \ud45d is continuous in both\nparameters1. Therefore, we can invert the Fourier transform to identify \ud707 as the Dirac measure at\n0 and conclude that \ud44b and \ud44d have the same law.\nHowever, under the assumption \ud707 = \ud6ff0, Remark 5.2 (i) in [11] shows that such a construction\nis not possible. Indeed, Remark 5.2 (i) in [11] contains the following statement: Given filtration \u2131\ud461\nand a square integrable \u2131\ud461-adapted processes \ud44b and \ud440 with the same second moments such that\ni) \ud44b is a local martingale in its own filtration, ii) \ud440 is an \u2131\ud461-martingale, and iii) \ud4401 = \ud44b1, then\n\ud440\ud461 = \ud44b\ud461 for all \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1]. Applying this result to our setting we get \ud44b\ud461 = \ud44d\ud461 for all \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1] and,\nthus, \u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud6fd\ud460 = \ud44d\ud461 = \ud44b\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud435\ud460 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud6fc(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud460.\n1This can be achieved by standard regularity assumptions on \ud44e which will ensure that \ud45d is a continuous solution\nof a Kolmogorov equation (see Theorem 3.2.1 in [22])\n5\nThis implies that\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud6fc(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud460 is a continuous martingale with finite variation, therefore it is\nidentically 0. Thus, \u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud6fd\ud460 = \ud44d\ud461 = \ud44b\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44e(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460)\ud451\ud435\ud460.\nSince \ud435 and \ud6fd are independent, this yields that [\ud44d,\ud44b] \u2261 0. However, as \ud44d = \ud44b, we have [\ud44d,\ud44d] \u2261 0,\nwhich implies \ud44b = \ud44d \u2261 0, which is a contradiction.\nThis example highlights that the relationship between \ud449 (\ud461) and \ud461 is very important for the\nexistence of a solution to the problem we aim to solve. The following assumption formalizes this\nrelationship along with imposing some regularity conditions. In particular, Assumption 2.1.1 rules\nout the above pathology, Assumption 2.1.2 controls the speed of convergence of \ud449 (\ud461) \u2212 \ud461 to 0 as\n\ud461\u2192 1 (for an earlier use of this assumption see [9]), and Assumptions 2.1.3 to 2.1.5 ensure sufficient\nregularity for the problem.\nAssumption 2.1 Fix a real number \ud450 \u2208 (0, 1]. \ud70e : [0, 1] 7\u2192 \u211d+ and \ud44e : [0, 1] \u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d+ are two\nmeasurable functions such that:\n1. \ud449 (\ud461) := \ud450+\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud70e\n2(\ud462)\ud451\ud462 > \ud461 for every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1), and \ud449 (1) = 1;\n2. lim\ud461\u21911 \ud7062(\ud461)\u039b(\ud461) log(\u039b(\ud461)) = 0, where \ud706(\ud461) = exp\n{\n\u2212 \u222b \ud4610 1\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212\ud460\ud451\ud460} and \u039b(\ud461) = \u222b \ud4610 1+\ud70e2(\ud460)\ud7062(\ud460) \ud451\ud460;\n3. \ud70e2(\ud461) is bounded on [0, 1];\n4. \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) is uniformly bounded away from zero, i.e. there exists a constant \ud716 > 0 such that\n\ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) \u2265 \ud716 for all \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1] and \ud467 \u2208 \u211d;\n5. \ud44e(\u22c5, \u22c5) \u2208 \ud4361,2 and has enough regularity in order for (2.1) has a unique strong solution2.\nRemark 2.3 Notice that Assumption 2.1.2 is, in fact, an assumption on \u039b(\ud461), since we always\nhave that lim\ud461\u21911 \ud706(\ud461) = 0. Indeed, since \ud449 (\ud461) is increasing and \ud449 (1) = 1, we have that \ud449 (\ud461) \u2264 1 for\n\ud461 \u2208 [0, 1] and therefore\n\ud706(\ud461) \u2264 1\u2212 \ud461 (2.5)\nwhich leads to conclusion that lim\ud461\u21911 \ud706(\ud461) = 0. For another use of this assumption and further\ndiscussion see [9].\nAlthough Assumption 2.1.2 seems to be involved, it is satisfied in many cases. The following remark\nstates a sufficient condition for this assumption to be satisfied.\nRemark 2.4 Note that when lim\ud461\u21911 \u039b(\ud461) < \u221e the condition is automatically satisfied due to the\npreceding remark. Next, suppose that lim\ud461\u21911 \u039b(\ud461) = \u221e, \ud70e is continuous in a vicinity of 1 and\n\ud70e(1) \u2215= 1. Then, an application of L\u2019Ho\u02c6spital rule yields\n0 \u2264 lim\n\ud461\u21911\n\u039b(\ud461) log(\u039b(\ud461))\n\ud706\u22122\ud461\n=\n1 + \ud70e2(1)\n2\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\nlog(\u039b(\ud461))\n(\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461)\u22121 .\n2A sufficient condition ensuring strong solution is given in Assumption 2.2.\n6\nThen note that since lim\ud461\u21911 \ud7062(\ud461)\u039b(\ud461) = 0, \u039b(\ud461) \u2264 \ud706\u22122(\ud461) for \ud461 close 1. Thus,\n0 \u2264 lim\n\ud461\u21911\n\u039b(\ud461) log(\u039b(\ud461))\n\ud706\u22122\ud461\n\u2264 1 + \ud70e\n2(1)\n2\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\nlog(\ud706\u22122(\ud461))\n(\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461)\u22121 = (1 + \ud70e\n2(1))\ud459\ud456\ud45a\ud461\u21911\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n1\n\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212\ud460\ud451\ud460\n(\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461)\u22121 = 0,\nafter another application of L\u2019Ho\u02c6spital rule since \ud70e2(1) \u2215= 1. This in particular shows that Assump-\ntion 2.1.2 is satisfied when \ud70e is a constant.\nBefore we present our main result we shall collect some preliminary results on the transition density\nof the diffusion\n\ud451\ud709\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461, \ud709\ud461)\ud451\ud6fd\ud461.\nWe are in particular interested in the existence and smoothness of this transition density. The natu-\nral way to obtain these results is to use the link between the transition density and the fundamental\nsolution of\n\ud464\ud462(\ud462, \ud467) =\n1\n2\n(\n\ud44e2(\ud462, \ud467)\ud464(\ud462, \ud467)\n)\n\ud467\ud467\n, (2.6)\nestablished in Corollary 3.2.2 in [22]. However, as we do not assume \ud44e to be bounded, this theorem\nis not applicable. On the other hand, since \ud44e is bounded away from 0, the following function\n\ud434(\ud461, \ud465) :=\n\u222b \ud465\n0\n1\n\ud44e(\ud461, \ud466)\n\ud451\ud466 (2.7)\nis well defined and the transformation defined by \ud701\ud461 := \ud434(\ud461, \ud709\ud461) will yield, via Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula,\n\ud451\ud701\ud461 = \ud451\ud6fd\ud461 + \ud44f(\ud461, \ud701\ud461)\ud451\ud461, (2.8)\nwhere\n\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) := \ud434\ud461(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465))\u2212 1\n2\n\ud44e\ud467(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465)), (2.9)\nand \ud434\u22121, the inverse of \ud434, is taken with respect to the space variable. This transformation along\nwith the next assumption is going to provide a uniformly elliptic operator which via Theorem 10 in\nChap. I of [12] and Theorem 3.2.1 of [22] would imply the existence and smoothness of transition\ndensity of \ud709.\nAssumption 2.2 \ud44f and \ud44f\ud465 are uniformly bounded on [0, 1] \u00d7 \u211d and \ud44f\ud465 is Lipschitz continuous\nuniformly in \ud461.\nDue to this assumption Corollary 3.2.2 of [22] implies that the transition density of \ud701 is the\nfundamental solution of\n\ud464\ud462(\ud462, \ud467) =\n1\n2\n\ud464\ud467\ud467(\ud462, \ud467)\u2212 (\ud44f(\ud462, \ud467)\ud464(\ud462, \ud467))\ud467. (2.10)\nFor the reader\u2019s convenience we recall the definition (p. 3 of [12]) of fundamental solution, \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467),\nof (2.10) as the function satisfying\n1. For fixed (\ud461, \ud465), \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) satisfies (2.10) for all \ud462 > \ud461;\n2. For every continuous and bounded \ud453 : \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d\nlim\n\ud462\u2193\ud461\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud453(\ud465)\ud451\ud465 = \ud453(\ud467). (2.11)\n7\nThe following proposition provides the existence of the transition density of \ud709 and formalizes the\nsmoothness requirement on the transition density together with some properties that we will use\nlater.\nProposition 2.1 Under Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2 there exists a fundamental solution, \u0393 \u2208 \ud4361,2,1,2,\nto (2.10) which also solves the adjoint equation\n\ud463\ud461(\ud461, \ud465) + \ud44f(\ud461, \ud465)\ud463\ud465(\ud461, \ud465) +\n1\n2\n\ud463\ud465\ud465(\ud461, \ud465) = 0. (2.12)\nMoreover, the function \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) defined by\n\ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) := \u0393(\ud461, \ud434(\ud461, \ud465);\ud462,\ud434(\ud462, \ud467))\n1\n\ud44e(\ud462, \ud467)\n, (2.13)\nsatisfies (2.6) for fixed (\ud461, \ud465) and it is the transition density of \ud709, i.e.\n\ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud451\ud467 = \ud443 (\ud709\ud462 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\ud709\ud461 = \ud465) for \ud462 \u2265 \ud461.\nFurthermore, \ud43a\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) exists and satisfies\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud43a\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud451\ud467 = 0 =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\u0393\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud451\ud467. (2.14)\nProof. Since \ud44f and \ud44f\ud465 are bounded and Ho\u00a8lder continuous under the assumptions of the propo-\nsition, it follows from Theorem 10 in Chap. I of [12] that the fundamental solution, \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467), to\n(2.10) exists and is also the fundamental solution of (2.12) by Theorem 15 in Chap. I of [12]. In\nparticular, \u0393 \u2208 \ud4361,2,1,2. Moreover, Assumption 2.2 also implies, due to Corollary 3.2.2 in [22], that\n\u0393 is the transition density of \ud701.\nDefine \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) by (2.13) and observe that \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) for fixed (\ud461, \ud465) solves (2.6). Since by\ndefinition \ud701\ud461 = \ud434(\ud461, \ud709\ud461) and \ud434 is strictly increasing\n\ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) \ud451\ud467 = \u0393(\ud461, \ud434(\ud461, \ud465);\ud462,\ud434(\ud462, \ud467))\n1\n\ud44e(\ud462, \ud467)\n\ud451\ud467\n= \u0393(\ud461, \ud434(\ud461, \ud465);\ud462,\ud434(\ud462, \ud467)) \ud451\ud434(\ud462, \ud467)\n= \ud443 (\ud701\ud462 \u2208 \ud451\ud434(\ud462, \ud467)\u2223\ud701\ud461 = \ud434(\ud461, \ud465))\n= \ud443 (\ud434(\ud462, \ud709\ud462) \u2208 \ud451\ud434(\ud462, \ud467)\u2223\ud434(\ud461, \ud709\ud461) = \ud434(\ud461, \ud465))\n= \ud443 (\ud709\ud462 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\ud709\ud461 = \ud465),\nwhich establishes that \ud43a is the transition density of \ud709.\nMoreover, equations (6.12) and (6.13) following Theorem 11 in Chapter I of [12] give the fol-\nlowing estimates:\n\u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) \u2264 \ud436 1\u221a\n\ud462\u2212 \ud461 exp\n(\n\u2212\ud450(\ud465\u2212 \ud467)\n2\n2(\ud462\u2212 \ud461)\n)\n, and (2.15)\n\u2223\u0393\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\u2223 \u2264 \ud436 1\n\ud462\u2212 \ud461 exp\n(\n\u2212\ud450(\ud465\u2212 \ud467)\n2\n2(\ud462\u2212 \ud461)\n)\n, (2.16)\n8\nfor some positive \ud436, depending on \ud450, and any \ud450 < 1. Note that\n\u222b\n\u211d\ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud451\ud467 = 1 =\n\u222b\n\u211d \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\ud451\ud467\nsince both \ud43a and \u0393 are transition densities. Thus, (2.14) will hold if one can interchange the deriva-\ntive and the integral. This is justified since due to (2.16) \u2223\u0393\ud465\u2223 \u2264 \ud43e exp\n(\u2212\ud4501\ud4672) when \ud465 is restricted\nto a bounded interval and where the constants \ud43e and \ud4501 do not depend on \ud465 and might depend\non \ud462 and \ud461. The result then follows from an application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem. \u25a0\nIn order to motivate our main result let\u2019s first consider the special case of \ud70e \u2261 0 so that \ud44d1 = \ud44d0.\nIn terms of the insider trading models that we have in mind this corresponds to the case when the\ninsider has the complete information at time-0 regarding the time-1 value of the traded asset as in\n[2]. If \ud707(\ud451\ud467) = \ud43a(0, 0; 1, \ud467)\ud451\ud467, then there exists a unique strong solution to\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\ud461 + \ud44e\n2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\n\ud43a\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, 1, \ud44d0)\n\ud43a(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461; 1, \ud44d0)\n\ud451\ud461,\nwith the initial condition\ud44b0 = 0, which satisfies all the properties stated inC1-C3 (see Proposition\n37 in [5] for a proof of this and other related results. Observe that this result does not require\nuniform ellipticity of \ud44e, thus the extension to time inhomogeneous case is immediate).\nThe specific form of the drift term in the SDE above thus gives us a hint to formulate the\nsolution of the original problem stated at the beginning of this section. Before we state our main\nresult we introduce one last assumption.\nAssumption 2.3 \ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) is absolutely continuous with respect to \ud461 for each \ud465, i.e. there exists a\nmeasurable function \ud44f\ud461 : [0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d such that\n\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) = \ud44f(0, \ud465) +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44f\ud461(\ud460, \ud465) \ud451\ud460,\nfor each \ud465 \u2208 \u211d. Moreover, \ud44f\ud461 is uniformly bounded.\nTheorem 2.1 Suppose \ud707(\ud451\ud467) = \ud43a(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467)\ud451\ud467 where \ud450 \u2208 (0, 1) is the real number fixed in Assump-\ntion 2.1 and \ud43a is given by (2.13). Let for \ud461 < 1\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\ud461 + \ud44e\n2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud451\ud461, (2.17)\nwhere\n\ud70c(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) := \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467). (2.18)\nUnder Assumption 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, on every interval [0, \ud447 ] with \ud447 < 1, there exists a unique strong\nsolution to the above SDE with the initial condition \ud44b0 = 0. Moreover, the conditions C1-C3 are\nsatisfied.\nWe will give a proof of this result in the special case \ud44e \u2261 1 in Section 3 and a proof of the general\nresult will be given in Section 4. However, we shall now state and prove two lemmata to show how\nthe choice of the drift term in (2.17) would imply condition C3, i.e. \ud44b as defined in (2.17) is a local\nmartingale in its own filtration. Before we can formulate them, we need to introduce the following\nnotation.\n9\nLet \u2131 := \ud70e(\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461; \ud461 < 1) and define the probability measure \u2119 on (\u03a9,\u2131) by\n\u2119(\ud438) =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud443 0,\ud467(\ud438)\ud707(\ud451\ud467), (2.19)\nfor any \ud438 \u2208 \u2131 . Of course, in order for this construction to make sense we need the existence of\na solution to (2.17). This will be proved in Section 4 in Corollary 4.1, thus, the above probability\nspace exists and is well defined. Under \u2119, (\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\ud461<1 would still be a strong Markov process (see\nCorollary 4.1). Let \ud4a9 be the null sets of \u2119. Proposition 2.7.7 in [13] shows that the filtration\n(\ud4a9 \u2228 \u2131\ud44b,\ud44d\ud461 )\ud461<1 is right-continuous. With an abuse of notation we shall still denote the \ud70e-algebra\ngenerated by \u2131 and \ud4a9 with \u2131 , and denote \ud4a9 \u2228 \u2131\ud44c\ud461 with \u2131\ud44c\ud461 for any (\u2131\ud44b,\ud44d\ud461 )\ud461\u22641-adapted process\n\ud44c . Next, let \u2131\u02dc\ud44b\ud461 := \u22291>\ud462>\ud461\u2131\ud44b\ud462 . We shall see in Remark 4.1 later that the \u2131\ud44b is right-continuous,\ni.e. \u2131\ud44b\ud461 = \u2131\u02dc\ud44b\ud461 . We say that \ud454\ud461 : \u03a9 \u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d is the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 , if \ud454\ud461 is\nmeasurable with respect to the product \ud70e-algebra, \u2131\ud44b\ud461 \u00d7 \u212c where \u212c is the Borel \ud70e-algebra of \u211d,\nand for any bounded measurable function \ud453\n\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d\ud461)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud467)\ud454\ud461(\ud714, \ud467) \ud451\ud467,\nwhere \ud53c is the expectation operator under \u2119. Note that due to Markov property of (\ud44b,\ud44d),\n\ud53c\u211a[\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] but we will keep the above notation for the clarity of the expo-\nsition. We will often write \u2119[\ud44d\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \ud454\ud461(\ud714, \ud467) \ud451\ud467 in order to refer to the conditional density\nproperty described above. Now, we are ready to state and prove the following lemma.\nLemma 2.1 Suppose there exists a unique strong solution of (2.17). If \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) given by (2.18)\nis the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 for every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1), then (\ud44b\ud461)\ud461\u2208[0,1) is a local martingale\nin its own filtration.\nProof. It follows from standard filtering theory (e.g. Theorem 8.1 in [16]) that\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\n\ud44b\n\ud461 + \ud44e\n2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud53c\n[\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] \ud451\ud461,\nwhere \ud435\ud44b is an \u2131\ud44b\u2212Brownian motion. However, if \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) is the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461,\n\ud53c\n[\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \u222b\n\u211d\n\ud43a\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\ud451\ud467 = 0\ndue to Proposition 2.1, so that\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\n\ud44b\n\ud461\nand, thus, \ud44b is a local martingale since \ud44e is continuous. \u25a0\nIn view of this lemma we show in Section 4 that \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) is indeed the conditional density of\n\ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 for every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1). The following lemma will be key in proving this result.\nLemma 2.2 Suppose there exists a unique strong solution of (2.17). Let \ud448\ud461 := \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud44d\ud461) and\n\ud445\ud461 := \ud434(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461), where \ud434 is defined by (2.7). Define\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) := \ud70c(\ud461, \ud434\u22121(\ud461, \ud465), \ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467))\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)), (2.20)\nwhere \ud70c is given by (2.18). Then,\n10\n1. \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \u22c5) is the conditional density of \ud448\ud461 given \u2131\ud445\ud461 iff \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) is the conditional density of\n\ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 .\n2. (\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \u22c5))\ud461\u2208[0,1) is a weak solution to the following stochastic PDE:\n\ud454\ud461(\ud467) = \u0393(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467) +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e2(\ud460)\n{\n\u2212(\ud44f(\ud449 (\ud460), \ud467)\ud454\ud460(\ud467))\ud467 + 1\n2\n(\ud454\ud460(\ud467))\ud467\ud467\n}\n\ud451\ud460 (2.21)\n+\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud454\ud460(\ud467)\n(\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467)\n\u2212\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud454\ud460(\ud467)\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467)\n\ud451\ud467\n)\n\ud451\ud43c\ud454\ud460 ,\nwhere\n\ud451\ud43c\ud454\ud460 = \ud451\ud445\ud460 \u2212\n(\u222b\n\u211d\n[\n\ud45d\ud465\n\ud45d\n(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467) + \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460)\n]\n\ud454\ud460(\ud467)\ud451\ud467\n)\n\ud451\ud460.\nProof. Notice that since \ud434(\ud461, \u22c5) is strictly increasing, \u2131\ud445\ud461 = \u2131\ud44b\ud461 for every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1) and there is\na one-to-one correspondence between the conditional density of \ud44d and that of \ud448 . More precisely,\n\u2119[\ud44d\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \u2119[\ud448\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ].\nThus, if \u2119[\ud44d\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud467) \ud451\ud467, then\n\u2119[\ud448\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ] = \u2119[\ud44d\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ]\n= \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467))\ud451\ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n= \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467))\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)) \ud451\ud467\n= \ud70c(\ud461, \ud434\u22121(\ud461, \ud445\ud461), \ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467))\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud434\u22121(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)) \ud451\ud467\n= \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467)\ud451\ud467\nby (2.20). The reverse implication can be proved similarly.\nIn order to prove the second assertion observe that due to (2.13) and (2.20) we have\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467). (2.22)\nWe have seen in Proposition 2.1 that \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) solves (2.10) for fixed (\ud461, \ud465) and it also solves\n(2.12) for fixed (\ud462, \ud467). Combining these two facts yields that \ud45d satisfies\n\ud45d\ud461(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467)+\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465)\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467)+\n1\n2\n\ud45d\ud465\ud465(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = \u2212\ud70e2(\ud461)(\ud44f(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467))\ud467+1\n2\n\ud70e2(\ud461)\ud45d\ud467\ud467(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467). (2.23)\nUsing Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula and (2.23), we get\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467) = \u0393(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467) +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e2(\ud460)\n{\n\u2212(\ud44f(\ud449 (\ud460), \ud467)\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467))\ud467 + 1\n2\n(\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467))\ud467\ud467\n}\n\ud451\ud460\n+\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud467)[\ud451\ud445\ud460 \u2212 \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460)\ud451\ud460]\nDue to (2.14), \ud451\ud43c\ud454\ud460 = \ud451\ud445\ud460 \u2212 \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460)\ud451\ud460 when \ud454\ud461(\ud467) = \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467). By repeating this argument we\narrive at the desired conclusion. \u25a0\nBefore we give a proof of Theorem 2.1, we will first investigate the Gaussian case, i.e. \ud44e \u2261 1.\n11\n3 Gaussian case\nUnder the assumption \ud44e \u2261 1, \ud44d becomes a Gaussian martingale and its transition density is given\nby \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) = 1\u221a\n2\ud70b(\ud462\u2212\ud461) exp(\u2212\n(\ud465\u2212\ud467)2\n2(\ud462\u2212\ud461) ) since it is a time-changed Brownian motion where the\ntime-change is deterministic. In this case, the equation (2.17) reduces to\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n\ud44d\ud461 \u2212\ud44b\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud451\ud461. (3.24)\nThis equation along with various properties of its solution is discussed in Danilova [9], Fo\u00a8llmer, et\nal. [11] and Wu [23].\nTheorem 3.1 Suppose \ud44e \u2261 1 and \ud70c is given by (2.18). Then, Theorem 2.1 holds.\nThe proof of the above theorem will be done in several steps, first of which being the following\nproposition.\nProposition 3.1 There exists a unique strong solution to (3.24) over [0,1). Moreover, ((\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461))\ud461\u2208[0,1)\nis strong Markov.\nProof. Since \ud467\u2212\ud465\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212\ud461 is Lipschitz over any [0, \ud447 ] for \ud447 < 1, there exists a unique strong solution\nto the above equation with \ud44b0 = 0 by Theorem 38 of Chap. V in [19]. Moreover, Theorem 5.4.20\nin [13] yields (\ud44b,\ud44d) has strong Markov property. \u25a0\nThe above proposition shows that condition C1 of the bridge construction is satisfied. We next\nshow that the solution to (3.24) satisfies condition C2 and then conclude this section with a proof\nof Theorem 3.1.\nLemma 3.1 Let Assumption 2.1 hold. Let \ud706(\ud461) = exp\n{\n\u2212 \u222b \ud4610 1\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212\ud460\ud451\ud460} and \u039b(\ud461) = \u222b \ud4610 1+\ud70e2(\ud460)\ud7062(\ud460) \ud451\ud460 be\nas in Assumption 2.1, and \u2113 > 0 be the associated constant in Assumption 2.1. Define\n\ud711(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) =\n1\u221a\n2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113)\n\ud452\n(\ud465\u2212\ud467)2\n2\ud7062(\ud461)(\u039b(\ud461)+\u2113) (3.25)\nThen, (\ud711(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461))\ud461\u2208[0,1) is a positive supermartingale and\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud711(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = +\u221e, \ud465 \u2215= \ud467 (3.26)\nProof. Direct calculations give\n\ud711\ud461(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) +\n\ud467 \u2212 \ud465\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud711\ud465(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) +\n1\n2\n\ud711\ud465\ud465(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) +\n\ud70e2(\ud461)\n2\n\ud711\ud467\ud467(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = 0 (3.27)\nThus, it follows from Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula that \ud711(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461) is a local martingale. Since it is obviously\npositive, it is a supermartingale.\nIn order to prove the convergence in the case of \ud465 \u2215= \ud467, consider two cases:\n12\n\u2022 Case 1: lim\ud461\u21911 \u039b(\ud461) < +\u221e. Then, since due to the Remark 2.3 we have that lim\ud461\u21911 \ud706(\ud461) = 0,\nwe obtain that\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud711(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = lim\n\ud461\u21911\n1\u221a\n2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113)\n\ud452\n(\ud465\u2212\ud467)2\n2\ud7062(\ud461)(\u039b(\ud461)+\u2113) = +\u221e (3.28)\n\u2022 Case 2: lim\ud461\u21911 \u039b(\ud461) = +\u221e. In this case we will have:\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\nlog\ud711(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = lim\n\ud461\u21911\nlog(2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113))\n[\n(\ud465\u2212 \ud467)2\n2\ud7062(\ud461)(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113) log(2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113))\n\u2212 1\n2\n]\n= +\u221e\nwhere the last equality is due to Assumption 2.1.2. Indeed, the condition yields that\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud7062(\ud461)2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113) log(2(\u039b(\ud461) + \u2113)) = 0\nsince when lim\ud461\u21911 \u039b(\ud461) = \u221e, lim\ud461\u21911 log(2(\u039b(\ud461)+\u2113))log(\u039b(\ud461)) = 1 and lim\ud461\u21911 \ud7062(\ud461)\u039b(\ud461) = 0. Therefore we\nhave lim\ud461\u21911 \ud711(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = +\u221e\nThe proof is now complete. \u25a0\nProposition 3.2 \ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44d1) = 1 where \ud44b is the unique strong solution to (3.24).\nProof. Let \ud440\ud461 := \ud711(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461). Then, \ud440 = (\ud440\ud461)\ud461\u2208[0,1) is a positive supermartingale by the\nprevious lemma. Using the supermartingale convergence theorem, there exists an \ud4401 \u2265 0 such\nthat lim\ud461\u21911\ud440\ud461 =\ud4401, \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s.. Using Fatou\u2019s lemma and the fact that \ud440 is a supermartingale, we\nhave\n\ud4400 \u2265 lim inf\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud4380,\ud467[\ud440\ud461] \u2265 \ud4380,\ud467[\ud4401] = \ud4380,\ud467\n[\nlim\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud711(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n]\n,\nwhere \ud4380,\ud467 is the expectation operator with respect to \ud443 0,\ud467. Since\ud4400 is finite, one has lim\ud461\u21911 \ud711(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\nis finite \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s.. Therefore, \ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 \u2215= \ud44d1) = 0 in view of (3.26). \u25a0\nProposition 3.3 Let \ud44e \u2261 1, \ud707(\ud451\ud467) = \ud43a(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467)\ud451\ud467 where \ud450 \u2208 (0, 1) is the real number fixed in\nAssumption 2.1 and \ud43a is given by (2.13). Then,\n\u2119[\ud44d\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] = \ud43a(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) \ud451\ud467.\nProof. As (\ud44b,\ud44d) is jointly Gaussian the conditional distribution of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 is also Gaussian\n(see Theorem 11.1 in [16]). Thus, it suffices to find the conditional mean \ud44d\u02c6\ud461 and the variance \ud6fe\ud461 in\norder to characterize the distribution completely. Theorem 10.3 in [16] yields\n\ud451\ud44d\u02c6\ud461 =\n\ud6fe\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\n{\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 \u2212 \ud44d\u02c6\ud461 \u2212\ud44b\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud451\ud461\n}\n, (3.29)\nand\n\ud451\ud6fe\ud461\n\ud451\ud461\n= \ud70e2(\ud461)\u2212 \ud6fe\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461 , (3.30)\n13\nwith the initial conditions that \ud44d\u02c60 = \ud53c[\ud44d0] = 0 and \ud6fe0 = \ud450 due to the choice of \ud707. In particular, \ud6fe\ud461\nis deterministic. One can verify directly that \ud6fe\ud461 = \ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461 satisfies (3.30) and the initial condition\nsince \ud449 (0) = \ud450 by Assumption 2.1. Thus, (3.29) becomes\n\ud451\ud44d\u02c6\ud461 = \ud451\ud44b\ud461 \u2212 \ud44d\u02c6\ud461 \u2212\ud44b\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud451\ud461,\ni.e. \ud44d\u02c6 is a solution to the following SDE:\n\ud451\ud44c\ud461 = \ud451\ud44b\ud461 \u2212 \ud44c\ud461 \u2212\ud44b\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud451\ud461, (3.31)\nClearly, choosing \ud44c\ud461 = \ud44b\ud461 will solve this SDE. Moreover, as the function\n\ud466\u2212\ud465\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212\ud461 is Lipschitz on [0, \ud447 ]\nfor any \ud447 < 1, it follows from Theorem 7 in Chap. V of [19] that (3.31) has a unique solution. Thus,\n\ud44d\u02c6\ud461 = \ud44b\ud461, which in turn yields that the conditional distribution of \ud44d\ud461 is Gaussian with mean \ud44b\ud461 and\nvariance \ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461. Note that the density associated to this distribution is given by \ud43a(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461;\ud449 (\ud461), \u22c5)\nwhen \ud44e \u2261 1. \u25a0\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 establish that conditions C1 and C2 are\nsatisfied. Finally, C3 is satisfied as well due to Proposition 3.3 in view of Lemma 2.1. \u25a0\n4 The general case\nWe now go back to proving Theorem 2.1. The proof is structured in several steps in the following\nway. We first show that there exists a strong solution, which is also Markov, to the system of\nSDEs given by (2.1) and (2.17) on the time interval [0, 1). Then we show that lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 exists\nand equals \ud44d1, \ud443\n0,\ud467-a.s. implying that there is no explosion until time 1 so that the solution can\nbe continuously extended to the whole interval [0, 1] and satisfies the bridge condition. Then we\ncharacterize the conditional distribution of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 and identify it with \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) which will\nin turn imply that \ud44b is a local martingale in its own filtration via Lemma 2.1. Finally, we provide\nan application of our method to the construction of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges.\n4.1 Existence of a strong solution on the time interval [0, 1) and the bridge\nproperty\nRecall from Lemma 2.2 that \ud448\ud461 = \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud44d\ud461), \ud445\ud461 = \ud434(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) where \ud434 is defined in (2.7) and \ud70c\nis related to \ud45d via (2.20). Since \ud434 is strictly increasing, the existence of the strong solution with\nMarkov property to the system of SDEs given by (2.1) and (2.17) and the convergence of \ud44b\ud461 to \ud44d1\nis equivalent to the existence of a strong solution with a Markov property of the following system,\nwhich can be obtained by an application of Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula,\n\ud451\ud448\ud461 = \ud70e(\ud461)\ud451\ud6fd\ud461 + \ud70e\n2(\ud461)\ud44f(\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\ud451\ud461\n\ud451\ud445\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n{\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n+ \ud44f(\ud461, \ud445\ud461)\n}\n\ud451\ud461, (4.32)\nand convergence of \ud445\ud461 to \ud4481.\n14\nFirst observe that due to (2.22), we have \ud45d\ud465(\ud461,\ud465,\ud467)\ud45d(\ud461,\ud465,\ud467) + \ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) =\n\u0393\ud465(\ud461,\ud465;\ud449 (\ud461),\ud467)\n\u0393(\ud461,\ud465;\ud449 (\ud461),\ud467) + \ud44f(\ud461, \ud465). Thus, due to\nLemma A.1 and Assumption 2.2, \ud45d\ud465(\ud461,\ud465,\ud467)\ud45d(\ud461,\ud465,\ud467) +\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) is locally Lipschitz for \ud461 \u2208 [0, \ud447 ] for any \ud447 < 1 and\ntherefore \ud445 is the unique strong solution to the corresponding stochastic differential equation on\n[0, 1) up to an explosion time (see Theorem 38 of Chap. V in [19]). Moreover, the solution will have\nstrong Markov property for any stopping time strictly less than the explosion time by Theorem\n5.4.20 in [13]. We shall now see that there won\u2019t be any explosion until time 1 and, indeed, \ud445\ud461\nconverges to \ud4481.\nProposition 4.1 Suppose that Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are satisfied. Then\n\ud443 0,\ud467(lim\n\ud461\u21911\n\ud445\ud461 = \ud4481) = 1.\nProof. As observed before there exists a strong solution to (4.32) up to an explosion time.\nLet\u2019s denote this explosion time with \ud70f . We will first argue that \ud443 0,\ud467(\ud70f < 1) = 0. Recall that\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) (see (2.22)) and define\n\u210e(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) :=\n\u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\n\ud45e(\ud462\u2212 \ud461, \ud465, \ud467) (4.33)\nwhere \ud45e is the transition density of a standard Brownian motion. This yields that\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467)\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467)\n=\n\ud467 \u2212 \ud465\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461 +\n\u210e\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n\u210e(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n.\nProposition A.1 in the Appendix states that \u210e\ud465(\ud461,\ud465;\ud449 (\ud461),\ud467)\u210e(\ud461,\ud465;\ud449 (\ud461),\ud467) is uniformly bounded on [0, 1]\u00d7\u211d\u00d7[0, 1]\u00d7\u211d,\nthus we can define an equivalent probability measure \ud443\n0,\ud467\non \ud4a21 (recall that all the stochastic\nprocesses have been defined on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461)) which is introduced at the beginning of Section 2) by\nthe following:\n\ud451\ud443\n0,\ud467\n\ud451\ud443 0,\ud467\n:= \u2130\n(\u222b \u22c5\n0\n\ud70e(\ud460)\ud44f(\ud460, \ud448\ud460)\ud451\ud6fd\ud460\n)\n1\n\u2130\n(\u222b \u22c5\n0\n{\n\ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud70f\ud460 ) +\n\u210e\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\n\ud70f\n\ud460 ;\ud449 (\ud460), \ud44d\ud460)\n\u210e(\ud460,\ud445\ud70f\ud460 ;\ud449 (\ud460), \ud44d\ud460)\n}\n\ud451\ud435\ud460\n)\n1\n,\nwhere \ud445\ud70f is the process \ud445 stopped at \ud70f and \u2130(\u22c5)\ud461 denotes the Dole\u00b4ans-Dade stochastic exponential\ntaken at time \ud461. Recall that \ud70e and \ud44f are bounded by Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2. Under this new\nmeasure \ud443\n0,\ud467\n, (4.32) becomes\n\ud451\ud448\ud461 = \ud70e(\ud461)\ud451\ud6fd\ud461\n\ud451\ud445\ud70f\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud445\n\ud70f\n\ud461 , \ud448\ud461)\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud70f\ud461 , \ud448\ud461)\n\ud451\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n\ud448\ud461 \u2212\ud445\ud70f\ud461\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461\ud451\ud461, (4.34)\nwhere \ud6fd and \ud435 are two (\ud4a2\ud461)-Brownian motions under \ud443 0,\ud467. First, observe that if \ud443 0,\ud467(\ud70f < 1) > 0,\nso is \ud443\n0,\ud467\n(\ud70f < 1). However, we have shown in Proposition 3.1 that (4.34) has a non-exploding\nsolution over [0, 1). This contradiction implies that \ud443 0,\ud467(\ud70f < 1) = 0 . Moreover, Proposition 3.2\nshows that \ud443\n0,\ud467\n(lim\ud461\u21911\ud445\ud461 = \ud4481) = 1. This yields \ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud445\ud461 = \ud4481) = 1 due to the equivalence\nof the measures.\n\u25a0\nThe next proposition and its corollary sum up what we have achieved so far in this section.\n15\nProposition 4.2 Under Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, there exists a unique strong solution to the\nSDE\n\ud451\ud445\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n{\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n+ \ud44f(\ud461, \ud445\ud461)\n}\n\ud451\ud461,\nwith \ud4450 = 0 such that (\ud445,\ud448) has strong Markov property over the interval [0, 1). Moreover,\n\ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud445\ud461 = \ud4481) = 1.\nProof. Propositions 4.1 and A.1 imply that \ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud445\ud461 = \ud4481) = 1, which in turn yields that\nthere is no explosion until time 1. Thus, Theorem 38 of Chap. V in [19] gives that \ud445 is indeed the\nstrong solution of the SDE over the time interval [0, 1). Moreover, due to Theorem 5.4.20 in [13]\n(\ud445,\ud448) has strong Markov property. \u25a0\nThe following corollary is immediate due to the one-to-one relationship, via the strictly mono-\ntone transformation \ud434, between (\ud445,\ud448) and (\ud44b,\ud44d).\nCorollary 4.1 Under Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, there exists a unique strong solution to (2.17)\non [0, 1] such that (\ud44b,\ud44d) has a strong Markov property. Moreover, lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 exists \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s. and\n\ud44b1 := lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44d1, \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s..\n4.2 Conditional distribution of \ud44d\nWe now turn to proving \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \u22c5) is the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 , which will in turn imply\nthat the solution of (2.17) is a local martingale in its own filtration via Lemma 2.1. In order to find\nthe conditional density of \ud44d we will first find the conditional density of \ud448 given (\u2131\ud445\ud461 ) and then use\nLemma 2.2. The reader is asked to review the notation introduced after the statement of Theorem\n2.1 at this point. Recall that \ud448\ud461 = \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud44d\ud461) and \ud445\ud461 = \ud434(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) where \ud434 is the function defined by\n(2.7). Under this transformation \ud4480 has a probability density given by \u2119(\ud4480 \u2208 \ud451\ud467) = \u0393(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467) \ud451\ud467,\nwhere the measure \u2119 is defined by (2.19).\nNext, fix a \ud447 < 1 and let \u2119\ud447 := \u2119\u2223\u2131\ud44b,\ud44d\ud447 be the restriction of \u2119 to \u2131\n\ud44b,\ud44d\n\ud447 . The reason for\nthis restriction is due to the fact that the drift term in (4.32) is not defined at \ud461 = 1 and this\nwill lead to inapplicability of the results of [14] that we cite later in this subsection. Note that\n\u2119[\ud448\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ] = \u2119\ud447 [\ud448\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ] for \ud461 \u2208 [0, \ud447 ] and, since \ud447 is arbitrary, this identity will allow us\nto obtain all the conditional distributions of \ud44d\ud461 for \ud461 < 1.\nThe remainder of this subsection is devoted to the proof of that\n\u2119\ud447 [\ud448\ud461 \u2208 \ud451\ud467\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ] = \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467) \ud451\ud467,\nwhere \ud45d is defined by (2.20). In order to achieve this goal we will use the characterization of the\nconditional distributions obtained by Kurtz and Ocone [14]. We refer the reader to [14] for all\nunexplained details and terminology.\nRemark 4.1 Let \u2119\ud447 be the absolutely continuous measure on the same space defined by the Radon-\nNikody\u00b4m derivative\nexp\n{\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b \ud447\n0\n(\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud448\ud460)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud448\ud460)\n+ \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460)\n)2\n\ud451\ud460\u2212\n\u222b \ud447\n0\n(\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud448\ud460)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460, \ud448\ud460)\n+ \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460)\n)\n\ud451\ud435\ud460\n}\n.\n16\nNote that, under \u2119\ud447 , \ud445 is a Brownian motion independent of \ud448 . Moreover, as we have just seen,\nthere is no explosion before time 1 for the system of SDEs for (\ud448,\ud445). Thus, it follows from the\nno-explosion criterion (see Exercise 2.10 in Chap. IX of [20]) that \u2119\ud447 is a probability measure\nequivalent to \u2119\ud447 . As the natural filtration of a Brownian motion is right continuous, this in turn\nimplies that (\u2131\ud44b\ud461 )\ud461\u2208[0,\ud447 ] is right continuous, too.\nLet \ud4ab be the set of probability measures on the Borel sets of \u211d topologized by weak convergence.\nGiven \ud45a \u2208 \ud4ab and \ud45a\u2212integrable \ud453 we write \ud45a\ud453 := \u222b\u211d \ud453(\ud467)\ud45a(\ud451\ud467). The next result is Lemma 1.1.\nin [14]:\nLemma 4.1 There is a \ud4ab-valued \u2131\ud44b-optional process \ud70b\ud461(\ud714, \ud451\ud465) such that\n\ud70b\ud461\ud453 = \ud53c[\ud453(\ud448\ud461)\u2223\u2131\ud445\ud461 ]\nfor all bounded measurable \ud453 . Moreover, \ud70b\ud461 has a right continuous version.\nLet\u2019s recall the innovation process\n\ud43c\ud461 = \ud445\ud461 \u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70b\ud460\ud705\ud460\ud451\ud460\nwhere \ud705\ud460(\ud467) :=\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud445\ud460,\ud467)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud445\ud460,\ud467)\n+ \ud44f(\ud460,\ud445\ud460). The next lemma will show that \ud445 is an integrable process and,\nthus, \ud70b\ud460\ud705\ud460 exists for all \ud460 < 1 since \ud44d is integrable and\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud460,\ud465,\ud467)\n\ud45d(\ud460,\ud465,\ud467) =\n\ud467\u2212\ud465\n\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212\ud460+ a bounded function, due\nto Proposition A.1.\nLemma 4.2 Let \ud445 be the unique strong solution of (4.32) under Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.\nThen, for every \ud447 < 1,\n\ud53c\n[\n\ud4452\ud461\n] \u2264 \ud436(1 + \ud708\u22122\ud447 )\ud452\ud436\ud708\u22122\ud447 \ud461,\nfor every \ud461 \u2264 \ud447 where \ud436 is a constant and \ud708\ud447 := inf\ud461\u2264\ud447 (\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461).\nProof.

The result then follows from Gronwall\u2019s inequality. \u25a0\nIn order to be able to use the results of [14] we first need to establish the Kushner-Stratonovich\nequation satisfied by (\ud70b\ud461)\ud461\u2208[0,\ud447 ]. To this end, let \ud435(\u211d2) denote the set of bounded Borel measurable\nreal valued functions on \u211d2 and consider the operator \ud49c0 : \ud435(\u211d+ \u00d7 \u211d) 7\u2192 \ud435(\u211d2) defined by\n\ud49c0\ud719(\ud461, \ud465) = \u2202\ud719\n\u2202\ud461\n(\ud461, \ud465) +\n1\n2\n\ud70e2(\ud461)\n\u22022\ud719\n\u2202\ud4652\n(\ud461, \ud465) + \ud70e2(\ud461)\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465)\n\u2202\ud719\n\u2202\ud465\n(\ud461, \ud465),\n17\nwith the domain \ud49f(\ud49c0) = \ud436\u221e\ud450 (\u211d+\u00d7\u211d), where \ud436\u221e\ud450 is the class of infinitely differentiable functions\nwith compact support. Due to Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 imposed on \ud70e and \ud44f, it is well-known, see\ne.g. Remark 5.4.17 in [13], that the martingale problem for \ud49c0 is well-posed and its unique solution\nis given by (\ud461, \ud448\ud461). Moreover, the Kushner-Stratonovich equation for the conditional distribution\nof \ud448 is given by the following:\n\ud70b\ud461\ud453 = \ud70b0\ud453 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70b\ud460(\ud49c0\ud453)\ud451\ud460+\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n[\ud70b\ud460(\ud705\ud460\ud453)\u2212 \ud70b\ud460\ud705\ud460\ud70b\ud460\ud453 ] \ud451\ud43c\ud460, (4.35)\nfor all \ud453 \u2208 \ud436\u221e\ud450 (\u211d)(see Theorem 4.3.1 in [6]) Note that \ud453 can be easily made an element of \ud49f(\ud49c0)\nby redefining it as \ud453n where n \u2208 \ud436\u221e\ud450 (\u211d+) is such that n(\ud461) = 1 for all \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, the above\nexpression is rigorous. The following theorem is a corollary to Theorem 4.1 in [14].\nTheorem 4.1 Suppose the conditions in Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hold. Let (\ud45a\ud461) be an \u2131\ud44b-\nadapted ca`dla`g \ud4ab-valued process such that\n\ud45a\ud461\ud453 = \ud70b0\ud453 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud45a\ud460(\ud49c0\ud453)\ud451\ud460+\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n[\ud45a\ud460(\ud705\ud460\ud453)\u2212\ud45a\ud460\ud705\ud460\ud45a\ud460\ud453 ] \ud451\ud43c\ud45a\ud460 , (4.36)\nfor all \ud453 \u2208 \ud436\u221e\ud450 (\u211d), where \ud43c\ud45a\ud461 = \ud445\ud461 \u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud45a\ud460\ud705\ud460 \ud451\ud460. Then, \ud45a\ud461 = \ud70b\ud461 for all \ud461 < \ud447 , a.s..\nProof. Proof follows along the same lines as the proof of Theorem 4.1 in [14], even though,\ndifferently from [14], we allow the drift of \ud445 to depend on \ud461 and \ud445\ud461, too. This is due to the fact that\n[14] used the assumption that the drift depends only on the signal process, \ud448 , in order to ensure\nthat the joint martingale problem (\ud445,\ud448) is well-posed, i.e. conditions of Proposition 2.2 in [14] are\nsatisfied. Note that the relevant martingale problem is well posed in our case since the system of\nSDEs in (4.32) has a unique strong solution and the drift and dispersion coefficients are bounded\non compact domains over the interval [0, \ud447 ] (see Proposition 5.3.20 and Remark 5.4.17 in [13] in\nthis regard). \u25a0\nNow, we can state and prove the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.2 Suppose the conditions in Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hold. Then,\n\ud70b\ud461\ud453 =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud467)\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467) \ud451\ud467,\nfor any bounded measurable \ud453 . Therefore,\n\ud53c[\ud453(\ud44d\ud461)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\ud461 ] =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud467)\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud467) \ud451\ud467.\nProof. We have seen in Lemma 2.2 that \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \u22c5) satisfies (2.21), i.e., \ud45a\ud461(\ud451\ud467) := \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud467)\ud451\ud467\nsolves (4.36). Then, it follows from Theorem 4.1 that \ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \u22c5) is the conditional density of \ud448\ud461,\nwhich gives the first assertion. The second assertion follows from the explicit relationship between\n\ud45d and \ud70c as described in Lemma 2.2 . \u25a0\n18\n4.3 Proof of the main result and application to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges\nNow we have all the results necessary to prove Theorem 2.1.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. The strong solution, Markov property and \ud443 0,\ud467(lim\ud461\u21911\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44d1) = 1\nfollow from Corollary 4.1. Moreover, it follows from Corollary 4.2 that \ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud467) is the conditional\ndensity of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 . Thus, \ud44b is a local martingale in its own filtration by Lemma 2.1 \u25a0\nNote that using the methods employed in this section one can prove the following theorem as\nwell.\nTheorem 4.2 Let \ud44d be the unique strong solution on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) to\n\ud44d\ud461 = \ud44d0 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e(\ud460)\ud451\ud6fd\ud460 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e2(\ud460)\ud44f(\ud460, \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud460,\nwhere \ud44f \u2208 \ud4361,2\ud44f with bounded derivatives and \ud70e is as before. Suppose \ud443 (\ud44d0 \u2208 \ud451\ud467) = \u0393(0, 0; \ud450, \ud467)\ud451\ud467\nfor some \ud450 \u2208 (0, 1). Let \ud70c(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) := \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) where \ud449 is as defined earlier and \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) is\nthe fundamental solution of (2.10).

Using the method employed in the proof\nof Proposition 3.3 we have that \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) is the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\ud461 for \ud461 < 1.\nThus, it remains to show that \ud44b1 = \ud44d1, \ud443\n0,\ud467-a.s..\nNote that the above convergence will be obtained if one can find a continuous function \ud44f(\ud461) with\n\ud44f(1) = 1 such that \ud44b\ud461 \u2212 \ud44f(\ud461)\ud44d\ud461 converges to 0 as \ud461 \u2191 1. We will choose this new function so that\nthat \ud44c\ud461 := \ud44b\ud461 \u2212 \ud44f(\ud461)\ud44d\ud461 defines a Markov process.

We keep\n20\nthe notation of the previous sections, in particular all the stochastic processes will be defined on\n(\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a).\nConsider a stock issued by a company with fundamental value given by the diffusion process\n\ud4b5 = (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461), (\ud44d\ud461), (\ud443 \ud467)\ud467\u2208\u211d) with values in \u211d, and satisfying\n\ud44d\ud461 = \ud44d0 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e(\ud460)\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud460), \ud44d\ud460)\ud451\ud6fd\ud460 (5.39)\nwhere \ud6fd is a standard Brownian motion adapted to (\ud4a2\ud461), \ud44e and \ud70e are deterministic functions,\n\ud449 (\ud461) = \ud450+\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud70e\n2(\ud460)\ud451\ud460, for some constant \ud450 and the probability density of \ud44d0 is \ud43a(0, 0; \ud450, \u22c5) with \ud43a\ngiven by (2.13). We will require \ud44e and \ud70e satisfy some further assumptions which are made precise\nin Assumption 5.2 below.\nThen, if the firm value is observable, the fair stock price should be a function of \ud44d\ud461 and \ud461.\nHowever, the assumption of the company value being discernible by the whole market in continuous\ntime is counter-factual, and it will be more realistic to assume that this information is revealed to\nthe market only at given time intervals (such as dividend payments times or when balance sheets\nare publicized).\nIn this model we therefore assume, without loss of generality, that the time of the next infor-\nmation release is \ud461 = 1, and the market terminates after that. Hence, in this setting the stock\ncan be viewed as a European option on the firm value with maturity \ud447 = 1 and payoff \ud453(\ud44d1). In\naddition to this risky asset, there is a riskless asset that yields an interest rate normalized to zero\nfor simplicity of exposition.\nThe microstructure of the market, and the interaction of market participants, is modeled as a\ngeneralization of [3]. There are three types of agents: noisy\/liquidity traders, an informed trader\n(insider), and a market maker, all of whom are risk neutral. The agents differ in their information\nsets, and objectives, as follows.\n\u2022 Noisy\/liquidity traders trade for liquidity reasons, and their total demand at time \ud461 is given\nby a standard (\ud4a2\ud461)-Brownian motion \ud435 independent of \ud6fd and \ud44d0.\n\u2022 Market maker observes only the total market order process \ud44c\ud461 = \ud703\ud461+\ud435\ud461, where \ud703\ud461 is the total\norder of the insider at time \ud461 which is an absolutely continuous process, and therefore \ud44c is\na continuous semimartingale on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a). This in particular implies that the market\nmaker\u2019s filtration is \u2131\ud44c\ud461 . Similar to [8], we assume that the market maker sets the price\nas a function of weighted total order process at time \ud461, i.e. we consider pricing functionals\n\ud446\n(\n\ud44c[0,\ud461], \ud461\n)\nof the following form\n\ud446\n(\n\ud44c[0,\ud461], \ud461\n)\n= \ud43b (\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) , \u2200\ud461 \u2208 [0, 1) (5.40)\nwhere \ud44b is the unique strong solution of\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud464(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud44c\ud461, \u2200\ud461 \u2208 [0, 1), \ud44b0 = 0 (5.41)\non (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) for some deterministic function \ud464(\ud460, \ud465) chosen by the market maker. More-\nover, a pricing rule (\ud43b,\ud464) has to be admissible in the sense of Definition 5.1. In particular,\n\ud43b \u2208 \ud4361,2 and, therefore, \ud446 is a semimartingale on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) on [0, 1).\n21\n\u2022 The informed investor observes the price process \ud446\ud461 = \ud43b (\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) where \ud44b is given by (5.41),\nand the true firm value \ud44d\ud461, i.e. her filtration is given by (\u2131\ud44d,\ud446\ud461 ). Since she is risk-neutral, her\nobjective is to maximize the expected final wealth, i.e.\nsup\n\ud703\u2208\ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464)\n\ud4380,\ud467\n[\n\ud44a \ud7031\n]\n= sup\n\ud703\u2208\ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464)\n\ud4380,\ud467\n[\n(\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2212 \ud4461\u2212)\ud7031 +\n\u222b 1\u2212\n0\n\ud703\ud460\ud451\ud446\ud460\n]\n(5.42)\nwhere \ud4380,\ud467 is the expectation with respect to the probability measure \ud443 0,\ud467 which is the law\nof (\ud44b,\ud44d) with \ud44b0 = 0 and \ud44d0 = \ud467, and \ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464) is the set of admissible trading strategies\nfor the given pricing rule (\ud43b,\ud464), which will be defined in Definition 5.2. That is, the insider\nmaximizes the expected value of her final wealth \ud44a \ud7031 , where the first term on the right hand\nside of equation (5.42) is the contribution to the final wealth due to a potential differential\nbetween price and fundamental at the time of information release, and the second term is the\ncontribution to final wealth coming from the trading activity.\nRemark 5.1 Note that by setting \ud70e \u2261 0 and \ud450 = 1, we obtain the \u201cstatic information market\u201d\nconsidered by [2]. Moreover, setting \ud44e \u2261 1 results in the model studied by [3].\nIn both cases, \ud449 (\ud461) \u2212 \ud461 was a measure of the uncertainty of the market about the value of \ud44d\ud461\nwhich is equivalent to the informational advantage of the insider in comparison with the market\nmaker (see discussion at the beginning of p. 393 of [3]). As we will see later in Remark 5.8, this\nobservation remains valid in our generalized case.\nRemark 5.2 We stress the fact that the total demand \ud44c = \ud44c \ud703 depends on insider\u2019s strategy \ud703,\nso that the market maker\u2019s filtration \u2131\ud44c = \u2131\ud44c \ud703 depends also on \ud703 (through \ud44c ). To avoid heavy\nnotation, we will drop the superscript \ud703 from total demand. So will simply write \ud44c and \u2131\ud44c instead\nof \ud44c \ud703 and \u2131\ud44c \ud703 , respectively.\nNote also that the above market structure implies that the insider\u2019s optimal trading strategy\ntakes into account the feedback effect i.e. that prices react to her trading strategy according to\n(5.40) and (5.41). Our goal is to find the rational expectations equilibrium of this market, i.e. a\npair consisting of an admissible pricing rule and an admissible trading strategy such that: a) given\nthe pricing rule the trading strategy is optimal, b) given the trading strategy, there exists a unique\nstrong solution, \ud44b\ud461, of (5.41) over the time interval [0, 1), and the pricing rule is rational in the\nfollowing sense:\n\ud43b(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) = \ud446\ud461 = \ud53c\u211a\n[\n\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\u2131\ud44c\ud461\n]\n(5.43)\nwith \ud4461 = \ud453(\ud44d1). To formalize this definition of equilibrium, we first need to define the sets of\nadmissible pricing rules and trading strategies.\nThe definition of admissible pricing rules is a generalization of the one in [2] and [3]. This\ngeneralization allows the market maker to re-weight his past information with a weighting function\n\ud464 as stated in (5.41).\nDefinition 5.1 For a given semimartingale \ud44c on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a), an admissible pricing rule is any\npair (\ud43b,\ud464) fulfilling the following conditions:\n1. \ud464 : [0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d+ is a function in \ud4361,2([0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d) bounded away from 0.\n22\n2. There exists a unique strong solution of\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud464(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud44c\ud461, \ud44b0 = 0 (5.44)\nover the time interval [0, 1) on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\u2131\ud44c\ud461 ),\u211a);\n3. \ud43b \u2208 \ud4361,2([0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d);\n4. \ud465 7\u2192 \ud43b(\ud461, \ud465) is strictly increasing for every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1];\nMoreover, given \ud703 \u2208 \ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464), a pricing rule (\ud43b,\ud464) is said to be rational if it satisfies (5.43).\nRemark 5.3 The strict monotonicity of \ud43b in the space variable implies \ud43b is invertible, thus, the\nfiltration of the insider is generated by \ud44b and \ud44d. Moreover, since \ud464 is bounded away from 0 the\nfiltrations generated by \ud44b and \ud44c are the same. This in turn implies that (\u2131\ud446,\ud44d\ud461 ) = (\u2131\ud435,\ud44d\ud461 ), i.e. the\ninsider has full information about the market.\nIt is standard (see, e.g., [3], [8] or [23]) in the insider trading literature to limit the set of\nadmissible strategies to absolutely continuous ones motivated by the result in Back [2], and we do\nso. The formal definition of the set of admissible trading strategies is summarized in the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition 5.2 An \u2131\ud435,\ud44d-adapted \ud703 is said to be an admissible trading strategy for a given pair\n(\ud43b,\ud464) if\n1. it is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, i.e. \ud703\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud6fc\ud460\ud451\ud460;\n2. There exists a unique strong solution, \ud44b, to the SDE3 (5.44) on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\u2131\ud435,\ud44d\ud461 ),\u211a) over the\ninterval [0, 1).\n3. (\ud44b,\ud44d) is a Markov process adapted to (\ud4a2\ud461) with law \ud443 0,\ud467;\n4. and no doubling strategies are allowed i.e.\n\ud4380,\ud467\n[\u222b 1\n0\n\ud43b2 (\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) \ud451\ud461\n]\n<\u221e. (5.45)\nThe set of admissible trading strategies for the given pair (\ud43b,\ud464) is denoted with \ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464).\nGiven these definitions of admissible pricing rules and trading strategies, it is now possible to\nformally define the market equilibrium as follows.\nDefinition 5.3 A triplet (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217, \ud703\u2217) is said to form an equilibrium if (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217) is an admissible\npricing rule for the semimartingale \ud44c \u2217 = \ud435+ \ud703\u2217, \ud703\u2217 \u2208 \ud49c(\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217), and the following conditions are\nsatisfied:\n1. Market efficiency condition: given \ud703\u2217, (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217) is a rational pricing rule.\n3Note that this SDE is well defined on (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\ud4a2\ud461),\u211a) since, due to absolute continuity of \ud703, \ud44c = \ud435 + \ud703 is a\nsemimartingale on it.\n23\n2. Insider optimality condition: given (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217), \ud703\u2217 solves the insider optimization problem:\n\ud4380,\ud467[\ud44a \ud703\n\u2217\n1 ] = sup\n\ud703\u2208\ud49c(\ud43b\u2217,\ud464\u2217)\n\ud4380,\ud467[\ud44a \ud7031 ].\nAdditionally, to define a well behaved problem we impose the following technical conditions on the\nmodel parameters.\nAssumption 5.1 \ud453 : \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d is a strictly increasing function belonging to \ud4361 such that\n\u2223\ud453(\ud467)\u2223 \u2264 \ud4581 exp (\ud4582\ud434(1, \ud467)) , \u2200\ud467 \u2208 \u211d\nfor some constants \ud4581 and \ud4582 where \ud434 is given by (2.7).\nRemark 5.4 The assumption that \ud453 is strictly increasing implies that the larger the signal \ud44d the\nlarger the value of the risky asset for the insider. This assumption will also play a role in order to\nprove that the proposed equilibrium pricing rule satisfies condition 4 in Definition 5.1.\nAssumption 5.2 We assume that the parameters of the model satisfy the following assumptions:\n1. Both \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) and \ud70e(\ud461) satisfy Assumption 2.1.\n2. \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) also satisfies a nonlinear PDE:\n\ud44e\ud461(\ud461, \ud467) +\n\ud44e2(\ud461, \ud467)\n2\n\ud44e\ud467\ud467(\ud461, \ud467) = 0 (5.46)\nRemark 5.5 Due to definition of \ud44f given in (2.9) we have\n\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465) = \ud434\ud461(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465))\u2212 1\n2\n\ud44e\ud467(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465))\n= \u2212\n\u222b \ud434\u22121(\ud461,\ud465)\n0\n\ud44e\ud461(\ud461, \ud466)\n\ud44e2(\ud461, \ud466)\n\ud451\ud466 \u2212 1\n2\n\ud44e\ud467(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465))\n=\n1\n2\n\u222b \ud434\u22121(\ud461,\ud465)\n0\n\ud44e\ud467\ud467(\ud461, \ud466) \ud451\ud466 \u2212 1\n2\n\ud44e\ud467(\ud461, \ud434\n\u22121(\ud461, \ud465))\n= \u22121\n2\n\ud44e\ud467(\ud461, 0),\nwhere the second equality is due to the definition of \ud434 (see 2.7) and the third equality follows from\nAssumption 5.2.2. Therefore, \ud44f is continuous and depends only on \ud461. Moreover, Assumptions 2.2\nand 2.3 are automatically satisfied since \ud44e \u2208 \ud4361,2 and \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1]. In this case \ud448\ud461 = \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud44d\ud461),\nwhere \ud434 is defined in (2.7), is a Gaussian process. Moreover, in the next subsection we will give\nsome heuristics indicating that \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) being a solution to (5.46) is a necessary condition for the\nexistence of an equilibrium. This suggests the conclusion that the only possible form for the signal\n\ud44d, for which an equilibrium in the sense of Definition 5.3 exists, is \ud44d\ud461 = \u03a6(\ud461, \ud448\ud461) where \ud448 is a\nGaussian process and \u03a6 is a deterministic function.\n24\n5.1 Equilibrium\nFirst, we shall provide some heuristics in order to motivate the PDE (5.46) we imposed on \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467).\nLet (\ud43b,\ud464) be any rational pricing rule. First, notice that a standard application of integration-\nby-parts formula applied to \ud44a \ud7031 for any \ud703 \u2208 \ud49c(\ud43b,\ud464) gives\n\ud44a \ud7031 =\n\u222b 1\n0\n(\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2212 \ud446\ud460)\ud6fc\ud460 \ud451\ud460.

(5.61)\nRemark 5.6 In Proposition 5.1 we show that if the system of PDEs given by (5.60) and (5.61)\nare satisfied, then there exists an optimal strategy for the insider. Under further assumptions one\ncan show that the requirement on (\ud43b,\ud464) posed by the PDEs (5.60) and (5.61) is in fact a necessary\ncondition for the existence of an optimal solution for the insider. Indeed, if \ud453 is bounded, and\ntherefore, \ud439 and \ud43b are bounded, and there exists an optimal strategy for the insider such that the\nvalue function is in \ud4361,2,2, then Theorem 4.3.1 in [17] gives that \ud43d has to satisfy simultaneously\n(5.54) and (5.55). Thus, \ud464 satisfying the nonlinear PDE above is a necessary condition in order\nto have a smooth value function \ud43d .\n26\nAn examination of (5.61) suggests that \ud44b associated with the optimal strategy is a martingale\nin its own filtration. In view of these observations, recalling the bridge construction in the previous\nsection with certain properties, it is easily seen that \ud44e(\ud461, \ud465) is a natural candidate for the equilibrium\nweight function \ud464\u2217(\ud461, \ud465). That is the reason why we need to assume that \ud44e satisfies PDE (5.46).\nRemark 5.7 PDE (5.46) admits many explicit solutions satisfying the properties listed in As-\nsumption 2.1.

We recall from Proposition 2.1 that the\nfunction \ud43a = \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud466) is the transition density of\n\ud451\ud709\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461, \ud709\ud461) \ud451\ud6fd\ud461, (5.73)\nand from Theorem 2.1 that there exists a unique strong solution under \u2131\ud435,\ud44d of the following SDE:\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\ud461 + \ud44e\n2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud451\ud461, \ud44b0 = 0.\nTheorem 5.1 Under Assumptions 5.1 and 5.2 there exists an equilibrium (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217, \ud703\u2217), where\n(i) \ud43b\u2217(\ud461, \ud465) = \ud439 (\ud449 \u22121(\ud461), \ud465) where \ud439 is given by (5.50) and \ud464\u2217(\ud461, \ud465) = \ud44e(\ud461, \ud465) for all (\ud461, \ud465) \u2208\n[0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d;\n(ii) \ud703\u2217\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0 \ud6fc\n\u2217\n\ud460\ud451\ud460 where \ud6fc\n\u2217\n\ud460 = \ud44e(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460)\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460,\ud44d\ud460)\n\ud70c(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460,\ud44d\ud460)\nwith \ud70c(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) and the process\n\ud44b\u2217 is the unique strong solution under \u2131\ud435,\ud44d of the following SDE:\n\ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud435\ud461 + \ud44e\n2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\n\ud70c\ud465(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud70c(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461, \ud44d\ud461)\n\ud451\ud461, \ud44b0 = 0.\nProof. We will first show that (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217) is admissible in the sense of Definition 5.1. Note\nthat since \ud439 \u2208 \ud4361,2, so is \ud43b\u2217 \u2208 \ud4361,2([0, 1] \u00d7 \u211d) and \ud464\u2217 is bounded away from 0 since \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) is\nassumed to be bounded away from 0 in Assumption 5.2. We also have that \ud44b\u2217 is the unique strong\nsolution to\n\ud44b\ud461 =\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud464\u2217(\ud460,\ud44b\ud460)\ud451\ud44c \u2217\ud460 ,\non (\u03a9,\ud4a2, (\u2131\ud44c \u2217\ud461 ),\u211a) by condition ii) of the theorem and that \ud451\ud44b\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud44c \u2217\ud461 = \ud464\u2217(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)\ud451\ud44c \u2217\ud461 . In\norder to complete the proof of admissibility we next show that \ud465 7\u2192 \ud43b\u2217(\ud461, \ud465) is strictly increasing\n29\nfor every \ud461 \u2208 [0, 1]. Observe that this is equivalent to the analogous property for \ud439 . First, using\n(5.50) and (2.13) we obtain\n\ud439 (\ud461, \ud467) =\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud466)\u0393(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467); 1, \ud434(1, \ud466)) \ud451\ud434(1, \ud466).\n=\n\u222b \ud434(1,\u221e)\n\ud434(1,\u2212\u221e)\n\ud453(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\u0393(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467); 1, \ud466) \ud451\ud466\n=\n\u222b \ud434(1,\u221e)\n\ud434(1,\u2212\u221e)\n\ud453(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\ud45e (1\u2212 \ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) + \ud450(\ud461), \ud466) \ud451\ud466,\nwhere the last line follows from Lemma A.3 and \ud45e is the transition density of standard Brownian\nmotion given by\n\ud45e(\ud461, \ud465, \ud466) =\n1\u221a\n2\ud70b\ud461\nexp\n(\n\u2212(\ud465\u2212 \ud466)\n2\n2\ud461\n)\n,\nand \ud450(\ud461) =\n\u222b 1\n\ud449 (\ud461) \ud44f(\ud460)\ud451\ud460. Due to bounds on \ud453 we can differentiate inside the integral to get that\n\ud439\ud467(\ud461, \ud467) =\n\u222b \ud434(1,\u221e)\n\ud434(1,\u2212\u221e)\n\ud453(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\ud45e\ud465 (1\u2212 \ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) + \ud450(\ud461), \ud466) 1\n\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n\ud451\ud466\n= \u2212\n\u222b \ud434(1,\u221e)\n\ud434(1,\u2212\u221e)\n\ud453(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\ud45e\ud466 (1\u2212 \ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) + \ud450(\ud461), \ud466) 1\n\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n\ud451\ud466\n=\n\u222b \ud434(1,\u221e)\n\ud434(1,\u2212\u221e)\n\ud453 \u2032(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\n\ud44e(1, \ud434\u22121(1, \ud466))\n\ud44e(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)\n\ud45e (1\u2212 \ud449 (\ud461), \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) + \ud450(\ud461), \ud466) \ud451\ud466 > 0,\nwhere the third equality follows from integration by parts, which is valid due to Assumption 5.1.\nThe final strict inequality is due to the fact that \ud453 is strictly increasing and \ud44e is strictly positive.\nTherefore, (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217) is admissible for the semimartingale \ud44c \u2217 = \ud435 + \ud703\u2217.\nNext, we turn to verify that \ud703\u2217 \u2208 \ud49c(\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217). By construction \ud703\u2217 is absolutely continuous.\nMoreover, the conditions 2 and 3 of Definition 5.2 follow from Theorem 2.1. Finally, condition 4\nfollows from Lemma A.3.\nTo finish the proof, let us verify that the triplet (\ud43b\u2217, \ud464\u2217, \ud703\u2217) given in the statement satisfy the\nfive conditions of Lemma 5.1. First, \ud43b\u2217 as defined satisfies condition 1 in Lemma 5.1 due to (5.51).\nThe second condition is trivially satisfied due to Assumption 5.2. For the third condition observe\nthat \ud44b\u2217 is a local martingale in its own filtration due to Theorem 2.1. However, since \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) is\nuniformly bounded away from 0, it follows that the natural filtrations of \ud44b\u2217 and \ud44c \u2217 coincide. The\nconclusion that \ud44c \u2217 is a Brownian motion in its own filtration follows as soon as one observes that\n\ud451\ud44c \u2217\ud461 =\n1\n\ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\u2217\ud461 )\n\ud451\ud44b\u2217\ud461 , i.e. \ud44c \u2217 is a local martingale with [\ud44c \u2217, \ud44c \u2217]\ud461 = \ud461.\nIn order to verify the fourth condition, observe that \ud43b\u2217(1, \ud465) = \ud439 (1, \ud465) = \ud453(\ud465). Since by\nTheorem 2.1 we have \ud44b\u22171 = \ud44d1, \ud443 0,\ud467-a.s., the condition holds.\nFinally, to demonstrate the martingale property of \ud43b\u2217(\ud461,\ud44b\u2217\ud461 ) observe that the transition density\nof \ud44b\u2217 is given by \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) since in its own filtration\n\ud451\ud44b\u2217\ud461 = \ud44e(\ud461,\ud44b\n\u2217\n\ud461 )\ud451\ud44c\n\u2217\n\ud461 ,\n30\nand \ud44c \u2217 is a Brownian motion so that \ud44b\u2217 satisfies the same SDE (5.73) as the process \ud709. Therefore,\n\ud53c\u211a[\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\u2131\ud44b\u2217\ud461 ] = \ud53c\u211a[\ud453(\ud44b\u22171 )\u2223\u2131\ud44b\n\u2217\n\ud461 ]\n=\n\u222b\n\u211d\n\ud453(\ud466)\ud43a(\ud461,\ud44b\u2217\ud461 ; 1, \ud466) \ud451\ud466\n= \ud439 (\ud449 \u22121(\ud461), \ud44b\u2217\ud461 )\n= \ud43b(\ud461,\ud44b\u2217\ud461 ),\nwhere one to the last equality is due to (5.50). \u25a0\nRemark 5.8 Note that it follows from Corollary 4.2 that the conditional density of \ud44d\ud461 given \u2131\ud44b\u2217\ud461\nis \ud43a(\ud461,\ud44b\u2217\ud461 ;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467). Note that \ud43a(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) converges to the delta function as \ud461 converges to \ud462.\nTherefore, the closer \ud449 (\ud461) is to \ud461, the smaller is the uncertainty of the market maker about the\nvalue of \ud44d\ud461. Hence, in our case, as in [3], \ud449 (\ud461) \u2212 \ud461 is a good measurement of the informational\nadvantage of the insider.\nA Appendix\nProposition A.1 Suppose Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are satisfied. Then, \u210e\ud465\u210e : [0, 1] \u00d7 \u211d \u00d7\n[0, 1]\u00d7 \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d as defined in (4.33) is (uniformly) bounded.\nIn order to prove the proposition above we need a few preliminary results. The first one is the\nfollowing classical result due to [1].\nLemma A.1 There exist positive constants, \ud6fc1, \ud6fc2,\ud4401, and \ud4402 such that\n\ud4401 \ud45e(\ud6fc1(\ud462\u2212 \ud461), \ud465, \ud467) \u2264 \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) \u2264\ud4402 \ud45e(\ud6fc2(\ud462\u2212 \ud461), \ud465, \ud467),\nfor all (\ud465, \ud467) \u2208 \u211d2 and \ud462 > \ud461.\nNext we need to obtain estimates on the function \u210e\ud465\/\u210e. This will be done by following the\napproach employed in [4]. For this purpose define the martingale \ud43f by\n\ud451\ud43f\ud462 = \u2212\ud43f\ud462\ud44f(\ud462, \ud701\ud462)\ud451\ud6fd\ud462, \ud462 \u2265 \ud461\nwith \ud43f\ud461 = 1 and let\n\ud43c(\ud462, \ud467) :=\n\u222b \ud467\n0\n\ud44f(\ud462, \ud466)\ud451\ud466 \ud441\ud462 :=\n\u222b \ud462\n\ud461\n{\n\ud43c\ud461(\ud460, \ud701\ud460) +\n1\n2\n\ud44f\ud465(\ud460, \ud701\ud460) +\n1\n2\n\ud44f2(\ud460, \ud701\ud460)\n}\n\ud451\ud460.\nRecall that \ud701\ud460 = \ud434(\ud460, \ud709\ud460) and \ud451\ud701\ud460 = \ud451\ud6fd\ud460+ \ud44f(\ud460, \ud701\ud460)\ud451\ud460, where the function \ud44f has been defined in (2.9).\nRemark A.1 Notice that Assumptions 2.2 and 2.3 ensure that the above formulation make sense.\nThen,\n\ud43f\u22121\ud462 = exp {\ud43c(\ud462, \ud701\ud462)\u2212 \ud43c(\ud461, \ud701\ud461)\u2212\ud441\ud462}\nand a straightforward application of Girsanov\u2019s theorem yields\n\u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) = exp (\ud43c(\ud462, \ud467)\u2212 \ud43c(\ud461, \ud465))\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467] \ud45e(\ud462\u2212 \ud461, \ud465, \ud467),\n31\nwhere \ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 is the expectation operator with respect to the law of the standard Brownian motion\nstarting at \ud465 at time \ud461. Therefore, (4.33) becomes\n\u210e(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) = exp (\ud43c(\ud462, \ud467)\u2212 \ud43c(\ud461, \ud465))\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467].\nObserve that \u2202\ud43c(\ud461,\ud465)\u2202\ud465 = \ud44f(\ud461, \ud465), which is bounded. Therefore, in order to establish the uniform\nboundedness of \u210e\ud465\/\u210e, we need estimates on\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\ud438\n\ud465,\ud45e\n\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467]\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467]\n.\nThe next lemma is going to give us an alternative representation of the numerator in the above\nexpression which allows us to obtain a uniform bound on \u210e\ud465\/\u210e.\nLemma A.2 Suppose Assumptions 2.2 and 2.3 are satisfied and \ud701\ud461 = \ud465. Then we have\n\u2202\ud441\ud462\n\u2202\ud465\n=\n\u222b \ud462\n\ud461\n{\n\ud44f\ud461(\ud460, \ud701\ud460) +\n1\n2\n\ud44f\ud466\ud466(\ud460, \ud701\ud460) + \ud44f(\ud460, \ud701\ud460) \ud44f\ud466(\ud460, \ud701\ud460)\n}\n\ud451\ud460.\nMoreover,\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467] = \u2212\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\nexp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2202\ud441\ud462\n\u2202\ud465\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467] .\nProof. In order to prove the first statement note that \ud701\ud462 = \ud465+\ud44a\ud462 for some Brownian motion\nwith\ud44a\ud461 = 0. Since the integrands are differentiable functions with bounded derivatives, this allows\nus to differentiate under the integral sign. Although derivative exists only almost everywhere, it is\nno problem since the law of Brownian motion is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue\nmeasure. For the second assertion take an infinitely differentiable \ud453 : \u211d 7\u2192 \u211d with a compact\nsupport. Therefore, if differentiation inside the expectation is justified,\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\ud453(\ud701\ud462)] = \ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n{exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\ud453(\ud701\ud462)}\n]\n= \u2212\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\u2202\ud441\ud462\n\u2202\ud465\nexp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\ud453(\ud701\ud462)\n]\n+\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\nexp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\ud453 \u2032(\ud701\ud462)\n]\n.\nAs \u2202\ud441\ud462\u2202\ud465 , \ud453 and \ud453\n\u2032 are bounded, we only need to show exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462) is bounded by an integrable\nfunction in order to justify the differentiation. Indeed, using Assumptions 2.2 and 2.3 on the\nboundedness of function \ud44f and its first derivatives, together with the definition of \ud441\ud462, one can\neasily prove that \ud441\ud462 \u2265 \ud43e(\ud45a\ud462 + \ud465 \u2212 \ud458) \u2265 \ud43e(\ud45a1 + \ud465 \u2212 \ud458) for some positive constants \ud458,\ud43e, where\n\ud45a\ud462 = min\ud461\u2264\ud460\u2264\ud462\ud44a\ud460. Thus, exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462) is bounded above by the random variable \ud436\ud452\u2212\ud45a1 for a\npositive constant \ud436, which may depend on \ud465 in a continuous fashion. It follows from the reflection\nprinciple for Brownian motion that \u2212\ud45a1 has the same law as \u2223\ud44a1\u2223. Moreover the random variable\nexp(\u2223\ud44a1\u2223) being integrable, we have that exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462) is bounded, uniformly in \ud462, by an integrable\nfunction which does not depend on \ud465 when \ud465 is restricted to a compact domain. This justifies the\ndifferentiation inside the expectation.\nOn the other hand,\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462] \ud453(\ud701\ud462)\n]\n= \ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n{\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462]\ud453(\ud701\ud462)}\n]\n\u2212\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462]\ud453 \u2032(\ud701\ud462)\n]\n,\n32\nthus, we will be done as soon as we have that\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\ud453(\ud701\ud462)] = \ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202\ud465\n{\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462]\ud453(\ud701\ud462)}\n]\n.\nSince \ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462] is bounded and away from zero whenever (\ud465, \ud701\ud462) belongs to a bounded\ndomain4 and \ud453 has a compact support, this will follow if \u2202\u2202\ud465\ud438\n\ud465,\ud45e\n\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462] is bounded for fixed\n\ud462 > \ud461 whenever (\ud465, \ud701\ud462) belongs to a bounded domain in \u211d2.

First note that in view of Lemma A.2\n\u210e\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\n\u210e(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\n= \u2212\n\n\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465)\u2212 \ud438\n\ud465,\ud45e\n\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462) \u2202\u2202\ud465\ud441\ud462\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467]\n\ud438\ud465,\ud45e\ud461 [exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462)\u2223\ud701\ud462 = \ud467]\n)\n.\nAs \u2202\u2202\ud465\ud441\ud462 is uniformly bounded, in \ud462 and \ud465, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u210e\ud465(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\u210e(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2223\ud44f(\ud461, \ud465)\u2223+ sup\n\ud465\n{\ness sup\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u2202\ud465\ud441\ud462\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223}\nby Jensen\u2019s inequality. However, sup\ud465\n{\ness sup\n\u2223\u2223 \u2202\n\u2202\ud465\ud441\ud462\n\u2223\u2223} is finite under our assumptions. Finally,\nsince \ud44f is also bounded under our assumptions, the result follows. \u25a0\nLemma A.3 Suppose that \ud44e(\ud461, \ud467) and \ud70e(\ud461) satisfy Assumption 5.2. Let \ud44d satisfy (2.1) and \ud44b be\nthe process defined in Theorem 5.1. Then,\n1. \ud44f(\ud461, \ud467) = \ud44f(\ud461) where \ud44f is defined by (2.9);\n2. the fundamental solution of\n\ud464\ud462(\ud462, \ud467) =\n1\n2\n\ud464\ud467\ud467(\ud462, \ud467)\u2212 (\ud44f(\ud462, \ud467)\ud464(\ud462, \ud467))\ud467\nis \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud462, \ud467) = \ud45e(\ud462\u2212\ud461, \ud465+\u222b \ud462\ud461 \ud44f(\ud460)\ud451\ud460, \ud467) where \ud45e is the transition density of standard Brownian\nmotion;\n4These can be proven by similar arguments that are used in showing exp(\u2212\ud441\ud462) is bounded by an integrable\nfunction.\n33\n3. For every \ud467 \u2208 \u211d\n\ud4380,\ud467\n[\u222b 1\n0\n\ud43b2 (\ud461,\ud44b\ud461) \ud451\ud461\n]\n<\u221e,\nwhere \ud43b(\ud461, \ud465) = \ud439 (\ud449 \u22121(\ud461), \ud465) with \ud439 given by (5.50).\nProof.\n1. This follows from Remark 5.5.\n2. Recall that \u0393 is the transition density of\n\ud451\ud701\ud461 = \ud451\ud6fd\ud461 + \ud44f(\ud461)\ud451\ud461.\nThus, \ud701\ud462 \u2212 \ud701\ud461 has a Gaussian distribution with mean\n\u222b \ud462\n\ud461 \ud44f(\ud460)\ud451\ud460 and variance \ud462\u2212 \ud461.\n3. Under the assumptions of the lemma, the process \ud448 and \ud445 as defined in Lemma 2.2 satisfy\n\ud451\ud448\ud461 = \ud70e(\ud461)\ud451\ud6fd\ud461 + \ud70e\n2(\ud461)\ud44f(\ud461)\ud451\ud461\n\ud451\ud445\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n{\n\ud45d\ud465(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n\ud45d(\ud461, \ud445\ud461, \ud448\ud461)\n+ \ud44f(\ud461)\n}\n\ud451\ud461,\nwhere \ud45d(\ud461, \ud465, \ud467) = \u0393(\ud461, \ud465;\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467). Therefore,\n\ud451\ud445\ud461 = \ud451\ud435\ud461 +\n{\n\ud448\ud461 \u2212\ud445\ud461 \u2212\n\u222b \ud449 (\ud461)\n\ud461 \ud44f(\ud460)\ud451\ud460\n\ud449 (\ud461)\u2212 \ud461 + \ud44f(\ud461)\n}\n\ud451\ud461.\nThe solution of the above SDE is given by\n\ud445\ud461 = \ud4480 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud44f(\ud460)\ud70e2(\ud460)\ud451\ud460\u2212 (\ud4480 \u2212\ud4450) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n1\n\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212 \ud460\ud451\ud460\n)\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n0\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n\ud460\n1\n\ud449 (\ud462)\u2212 \ud462\ud451\ud462\n)\n\ud44f(\ud460)\ud70e2(\ud460)\u2212 \ud44f(\ud460) +\n\u222b \ud449 (\ud460)\n\ud460 \ud44f(\ud462)\ud451\ud462\n\ud449 (\ud460)\u2212 \ud460\n)\n\ud451\ud460 (A.74)\n+\n\u222b \ud461\n0\n\ud70e(\ud460)\n(\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n\ud460\n1\n\ud449 (\ud462)\u2212 \ud462\ud451\ud462\n))\n\ud451\ud6fd\ud460 +\n\u222b \ud461\n0\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \ud461\n\ud460\n1\n\ud449 (\ud462)\u2212 \ud462\ud451\ud462\n)\n\ud451\ud435\ud460.\nTherefore, \ud445\ud461 is a normal variable with bounded (uniformly in \ud461) mean and variance. Indeed,\ndue to Remark 2.3, sup\ud460,\ud461 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u222b \ud461\ud460 1\ud449 (\ud462)\u2212\ud462\ud451\ud462) < \u221e. Moreover, \ud44f and \ud70e are bounded by\nassumption. Therefore, the moment generating function of \ud445\ud461 is a bounded function of time\nin [0, 1]. Next, observe that\n\ud439 (\ud461, \ud467) = \ud438[\ud453(\ud44d1)\u2223\ud44d\ud461 = \ud467] = \ud438[\ud453(\ud434\u22121(1, \ud4481))\u2223\ud448\ud461 = \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)]\n\u2264 \ud4581\ud438[exp(\ud4582\ud4481)\u2223\ud448\ud461 = \ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467)]\n= \ud4581 exp\n(\n\ud4582\n\u222b 1\n\ud461\n\ud44f(\ud460)\ud451\ud460+ \ud4582\ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467) +\n1\n2\n\ud45822(1\u2212 \ud449 (\ud461))\n)\n\u2264 \ud43e exp(\ud4582\ud434(\ud449 (\ud461), \ud467))\n34\ndue to Assumption 5.1 on \ud453 ; the third line is due to the form of the moment generating\nfunction of the Gaussian random variable \ud4481 \u2212 \ud448\ud461. This in particular implies\n\ud4380,\ud467[\ud43b2(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461)] = \ud438\n0,\ud467[\ud439 2(\ud449 \u22121(\ud461), \ud44b\ud461)]\n\u2264 \ud43e2\ud4380,\ud467 [exp (2\ud4582\ud434(\ud461,\ud44b\ud461))]\n= \ud43e2\ud4380,\ud467 [exp (2\ud4582\ud445\ud461)] .\nNote that \ud460\ud462\ud45d\ud461\u2208[0,1]\ud4380,\ud467 [exp (2\ud4582\ud445\ud461)] < \u221e since the moment generating function of \ud445 is\nbounded.
