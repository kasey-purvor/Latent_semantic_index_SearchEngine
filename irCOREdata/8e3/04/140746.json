Introduction \n \n    The quartz crystal microbalance is a label free technique, which minimises interference with the \ninteraction being studied and also eliminates expensive and time-consuming purification \nprocedures in many situations. A piezoelectric device is portable, simple and cost effective, and is \nsuitable for real-time monitoring of biospecific interactions such as antigen-antibody, receptor-\nligand, enzymes-substrate inetractions etc. with high sensitivity and specificity. The principles \nunderlying measurement using a piezoelectric sensor and the general experimental apparatus were \ndescribed by Luong and Guilbault [1]. The applications of quartz crystal microbalance \nimmunosensors and future trends were presented in a review [2]. The first immunosensor based on \nQCM for detecting anti-BSA antibody by coating antigen was developed by Shons in 1972 [3]. \nFollowing this development, piezoelectric immunosensors have been widely used in liquid-phase \nanalysis and have been adopted in the fields of clinical analysis, environmental monitoring [4], \nfood analysis and veterinary diagnosis [5]. \n    In general, protein immobilization on biosensor surfaces can be performed by covalent binding \nor adsorption or avidin-biotin binding on the crystal surface. For small ligands and proteins, \ncovalent binding provides the highest irreversible surface loading and is therefore the best method \nto immobilize molecules on the crystal surface [6]. Interest in the properties and applications of \ncovalent immobilisation based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has grown enormously \nbecause they provide numerous advantages for sensor performance [7, 8]. Different types of \ncovalent binding of materials on the surface of piezoelectric crystals were discussed in previous \npublications [9-11]. Adsorption procedures are easier and quicker than the other immobilization \ntechniques, but they do not yield stable affinity systems for biosensor design. Weak bonds created \nby non-covalent attachment usually caurse severe leakage of the biomolecule off the surface and \ndegradation of performance with use. Some of these methods can be problematic due to random \norientation and detachment of the immobilized proteins [12]. The best immobilization technique \ndepends on the individual system and it should provide good sensor performance in terms of \nsensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and regeneration ability.  \n    The objective of the present study was to develop a piezoelectric immunosensor for the \ndetermination of the algal toxin, okadaic acid (Figure 1). A competitive format (Figure 2) \nincorporating an immobilisation method using polyethylenimine with glutaraldehyde cross-linking \nwas adopted. The crystal surface was modified with polymer polyethylenimine and the free amino \ngroups obtained were activated by glutaraldehyde. OA-BSA conjugate was then bound to the \nactivated derivatives to form a cross-linked complex, which strongly attached to the gold surface \nof the crystal, resulting in good long-term storage properties. However, the detection limit and the \nsensitivity of the sensor were not satisfactory. For this reason, an antibody-BSA hydrogel was \nadopted to improve the performance of the piezoelectric immunosensor. Stimuli-sensitive \nhydrogels have attracted considerable attention as intelligent materials, since they can abruptly \nchange their volume in response to environmental change, such as solvent composition, pH, \ntemperature, concentration of guest, light and electric field [13-17]. Such gel swelling effects have \nbeen observed with both antibody and antigen systems [18]. This important phenomenon has not \nbeen previously applied to the detection of okadaic acid, a key algal toxin in the environment. Our \nstudies commenced with an initial evaluation of these principles applied to the detection of OA.  \nThe work focused on the preparation of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-antibody hydrogel with \nglutaraledehyde cross-linking and the effect of concentration of okadaic acid on the volume of the \ngel. \n         \n2. Experimental \n \n2.1. Apparatus  \n \n    The liquid-phase piezoelectric detector and piezoelectric crystals (AT-cut, quartz plate diameter \n14 mm, gold electrode diameter 8mm, 10 MHz resonant frequency) used for the first phase of the \nwork were purchased from Universal Sensors, INC (New Orleans, USA). For the work on the \nantibody-BSA gel, crystals with a Cr\/Au surface and a diameter of 6 mm were purchased from \nTechnobiochip (Marciana Marina, Italy).  ELISA was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate \n(Nalge Nunc International, Nunc-ImmunoTM Plate, MaxiSorpTM Surface, made in Denmark). Bio-\nTek Instruments supplied the reader (model EL 311SX). A Slider-A-Lyzer cassette, 3,500 MWCO \n(from Pierce) was used for the purification of OA-BSA conjugate and the purified conjugate was \nanalysed for protein content using an uv\/vis spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard). \n 2.2. Chemicals \n \n    Anti-okadaic acid monoclonal antibody was purchased from Iatron laboratories, INC (Tokyo, \nJapan). Okadaic acid (Prorocentrum concavum) was purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, \nUK), p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1-ethyl-3-(3-\ndimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS), anti-mouse IgG-\nalkaline phosphatase conjugate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyethylenimine (PEI), \nglutaraldehyde (GA) and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemicals LTD (Dublin, \nIreland).  \n \n2.3. Conjugation of okadaic acid to bovine serum albumin  \n \n    Okadaic acid (100 \u00b5g) was dissolved in 80 \u00b5l of DMSO and added to the mixture of 10 \u00b5l of \nEDC (20mg\/ml) and 10 \u00b5l of NHS (10 mg\/ml). The mixture was allowed to react for two hours by \nshaking gently at room temperature. A molar ratio of 14:1 was used in the conjugation of OA to \nBSA. BSA (592 \u00b5g) was dissolved in 350 \u00b5l of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% \nNaN3 and was added drop-wise to activated-OA. The reaction was allowed to proceed for four \nhours by shaking gently on ice. After purification by dialysis with four changes of buffer \novernight, the total volume of the conjugate was brought up to 1ml and the concentration of \nprotein in the conjugate was determined at 280 nm using an uv\/vis spectrophotometer. The molar \nabsorptivity of BSA was estimated by measuring the absorbance of 1 mg\/ml BSA solution and \nwas used to calculate the concentration of protein in OA-BSA.  \n \n2.4. ELISA for the assessment of OA-BSA conjugate \n \n    The immobilisation of OA-BSA conjugate onto a microtiter plate was achieved by adding 50 \u00b5l \nof conjugation solution to each well and incubating, followed by blocking using 100 \u00b5l of 1% \nBSA in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The antibody binding was then carried out by adding 50 \u00b5l of \n30 \u00b5g antibody solution and incubating, followed by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of anti-mouse IgG-\nalkaline phosphatase (10,000-fold dilution) to each well. Colour development was achieved by the \naddition of 100 \u00b5l of 1 mg\/ml p-NPP in 0.1 M diethanolamine, pH 9.5 containing 1 mM MgCl2 \nand 50 mM KCl and incubating. The yellow product was monitored at 405 nm. All incubations \nproceeded at 37 \u00b0C for one hour. Between incubations, the ELISA plate was washed three times \nwith Tris buffer. \n \n2.5 Preparation of a piezoelectric sensor using polyethylenimine with cross-linking \n \n    A crystal surface was cleaned as previously described in a reference [19]. The crystal was \nplaced into a solution of 1.2 M NaOH for five minutes and then into 1.2 M HCl for five minutes, \nfollowed by the addition of 20 \u00b5l of concentrated HCl for 1 min. The crystal was then washed \ntwice with ethanol and finally washed thoroughly with distilled water followed by drying at 37 \u00b0C. \n    PEI (10 \u00b5l of 2 % in methanol) was added onto the crystal surface in a flow cell and after air-\ndrying for 30 min the PEI-coated crystal was washed four times using methanol. The free amino \ngroup obtained on the crystal surface was activated using 40 \u00b5l of 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in distilled \nwater and incubation proceeded for 45 min. After washing thoroughly using distilled water, 15 \u00b5l \nof a 1:2 dilution of stock OA-BSA conjugate plus 5 \u00b5l of buffer was applied onto the treated \ncrystal surface and allowed to react for 60 min. After extensive washing, the crystal surface with \ncross-linked complex was blocked using 50 \u00b5l of 0.1M glycine in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 \nfor 60 minutes. After washing and air-drying the device was stored dry in a fridge prior to use. All \nincubations proceeded at room temperature. To be able to cover the whole crystal surface a \nvolume of 20 \u00b5l solution was applied onto a crystal surface. The crystal frequency was monitored \nbefore (F1) and after (F2) material binding (non-real-time measurement), and the frequency \nchange (\u2206F) resulting from material binding was calculated using \u2206F = F2 \u2013 F1. \n    For the calibration for okadaic acid, a mixture of free OA (5 \u00b5l ) and 3.75 \u00b5g of \u03b1-OA (15 \u00b5l, \n0.25 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l) was incubated for 20 min before adding to a sensor surface. After the incubation of the \nmixture onto the sensor surface for 60 min the sensor surface was washed twice using 200 \u00b5l of \ndistilled water and its frequency was monitored.  \n \n2.6. Preparation of an antibody-BSA hydrogel on a crystal surface \n     A crystal was placed into a solution of H2O2\/H2SO4 (1:3, V\/V) for 10 seconds and washed \nthoroughly using distilled water. After drying in an oven it was stored in a desiccator for up to one \nweek. The procedure for the preparation of the membrane was similar to the method previously \ndescribed by Wan [20]. Antibody solution (200 \u00b5l, 5 mg\/ml) was freeze dried and was then \ndissolved in 20 \u00b5l of 5 % BSA solution in 0.05M phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 5% glycerol. \nAn aliquot of the mixture (3 \u00b5l) was applied onto a clean crystal surface and the crystal was placed \nin a saturated glutaraldehyde vapour to form a solid membrane by cross-linking. In order to protect \nthe electrical connections of the crystal they were covered with adhesive tape during the exposure \nto glutaraldehyde. The sensor was allowed to form a solid membrane on its surface while stored in \na refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) overnight. The glycerol served as a plasticizer to inhibit the formation of \ncracks in the membrane and this resulted in a homogenous membrane and better adhesion to the \ngold surface. The sensors were stored dry in a fridge prior to use. \n \n2.7. Measurement system for crystal with an antibody-BSA gel \n \n    Measurements were carried out with a single-channel flow injection system assembled with \nTeflon tubing and a peristaltic pump (Gilson Minipuls 3, Paris, France) with a flow rate of 20 \n\u00b5l\/min. The coated crystal was mounted in a flow cell which was connected to a Libra \u03b1 \nNanobalance Measuring System (Technobiochip, Marciana, Italy) to record the frequency. The \nLibra \u03b1 Nanobalance was interfaced to a PC for data recording and processing. The system was \ndriven by LIBRA 3.1 software running under MS-WindowsTM. Before making an injection the \nsensor was stabilized by running 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for about 6 hours. Sample \nsolution (500 \u00b5l) containing okadaic acid in the same buffer, was introduced into the buffer stream \nvia a valve loop injector. The oscillation frequency of crystal was recorded with time (real-time \nmeasurement) and the frequency change (\u2206F) resulting from the reaction of the antibody with the \nantigen was calculated from the difference in frequency before (F1) and after (F2) the binding \nevent, \u2206F = F2 - F1.\n \n3. Results and discussion \n 3.1. Investigation of a coupling method for detecting okadaic acid \n \nFour crystals were taken as supplied, rinsed with distilled water and then dried in air for 35 \nminutes. Considerable decreases in oscillation frequency of the crystals were observed due to \nwater variable retention. To eliminate this effect on a crystal frequency and avoid air-drying step \n100 \u00b5l of distilled water was added onto each crystal surface prior to frequency measurement \nbefore and after biomolecule binding. \nThe determination of okadaic acid using a piezoelectric immunosensor with different coupling \nmethods was investigated. The techniques examined were protein A, protein G and \npolyethylenimine with glutaraldehyde cross-linking. With protein A coupling, buffer pH values of \n5.5 and 7.4 for protein A binding and pH values of 5.5, 7.4 and 9.6 for antibody binding were \ntested and the results showed that the best immobilisation occurred at pH of 5.5 and 7.4 for the \nprotein A binding and for the antibody binding, respectively. The frequency change resulting from \nanti-OA antibody (1 mg\/ml) binding using protein A and protein G were similar. However, the \nsignal obtained in the determination of okadaic acid was very small. A large frequency change for \nOA-BSA binding to a gold surface was obtained using polyethylenimine with glutaraldehyde \ncross-linking, and therefore this method was applied to our further studies. \n \n3.2. Characterisation  \nIn order to provide an immunosensor with a good performance the molar ratios of OA:BSA for \nthe conjugatation, the incubation time for the activation of PEI on a crystal surface using \nglutaraldehyde, the influence of the dilution factor of the conjugate and the amount of antibody on \na crystal frequency were investigated. \n    Different molar ratios (4:1, 14:1 and 30:1) of OA:BSA were studied for the conjugation of OA \nto BSA. The results with ELISA showed that the absorbance for the conjugate (14:1) was 1.5 \ntimes higher than the others. The two conjugates (l4:1 and 30:1) were also used with piezoelectric \ncrystals and the frequency changes for both conjugates were almost same. The molar ratio of 14:1 \nin the conjugation of OA to BSA was adopted in further work. \n    Optimisation of the incubation time for the activation of PEI on a crystal surface using \nglutaraldehyde was performed. Figure 3 shows that the frequency change of a crystal increased \nwith the incubation time of glutaraldehyde on PEI-coated crystals and reached a plateau at \nincubation time of 45 min. \nThe effect of the dilution factor of OA-BSA conjugate on crystal frequency was investigated. \nThe dilution factors (1:8, 1:4 and 1:2) of OA-BSA conjugate were examined and the results \nobtained were shown in Figure 4. The dilution factor of 1:2 of conjugate produced an adequate \nsignal and it was adopted for further work. \nAs expected, the frequency change of sensors increased with increasing amount of antibody \nadded onto their surfaces.  As shown in Figure 5, 20 \u00b5g of antibody (20 \u00b5l, 1.0 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l of antibody) \nproduced a satisfactory response with a frequency change of 440 Hz being recorded. In order to \nminimise the amount of antibody needed to produce a significant signal, improvement of the \nquality of the OA-BSA conjugate was studied. The results obtained showed that significantly less \nantibody was required to generate a response; 3.75 \u00b5g of antibody resulted in a frequency change \nof approximately 500 Hz when using the new OA-BSA conjugate, this was because a higher \ndensity of conjugate (more okadaic acid bound to the BSA) was obtained by using a more \nconcentrated BSA solution for the conjugation.  \n     \n3.3. Storage lifetime of a piezoelectric immunosensor \n \nClean crystals were treated with polyethylenimine, glutaraldehyde and OA-BSA conjugate and \nwere then blocked using glycine as described in the experimental section. After air-drying the \nsensors were stored dry in a refrigerator (4 \u00b0C). The frequencies of three treated crystals were \nmeasured regularly over a period of one week and no changes in frequency were observed (Figure \n5).  The immobilisation of antibody (15 \u00b5l, 0.5 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l) onto the sensor\u2019s surface with time was  \nfurther investigated at 1, 19 and 39 days after storage. The results obtained showed that after 38 \ndays the immobilization of antibody to the sensor\u2019s surface produced the same frequency change \nas that obtained with the freshly treated sensors. This good long-term storage stability allowed us \nto prepare many sensors in a single batch thus aiding consistency between experiments and saving \nmaterials and time. \n 3.4. Calibration for okadaic acid using polyethylenimine with cross-linking  \n \nSince okadaic acid dissolves in organic solvents such as ethanol and a quartz crystal senses the \ndensity change on its surface, the effect of ethanol on a crystal surface was studied with both real-\ntime (crystal frequency was measured versus reaction time)  and non-real-time measurement as \nmentioned in the experimental section. The results obtained showed that the crystal frequency \ndecreased on the addition of ethanol to distilled water on sensors surface with real-time \nmeasurement, but a change in frequency was not observed in the case of the non-real-time \nmeasurement. Therefore the non-real-time measurement mode was applied to produce the \ncalibartion curve for okadaic acid to avoid the effect of ethanol on the oscillation frequency of the \ncrystal.  \nDifferent incubation times (0 and 20 min) of the mixture of antibody and free okadaic acid were \ntested prior to application to the sensor. Following incubation of the mixture for zero minutes, \nabout 63 % of antibody was bound to OA-BSA conjugate immobilized on the crystal surface after \none hour reaction time between the mixture and conjugate. This resulted in less competition \nbetween free OA and OA in conjuate on the crystal surface. In contrast, at the mixture incubation \ntime of 20 min most of antibody reacted with the free okadaic acid and much less antibody was \nbound to OA-BSA conjugate on the sensor surface, resulting in a higher sensitivity to okadaic \nacid.  \nThe calibration curve for okadaic acid was prepared in the concentration range from 0 to 25 \n\u00b5g\/ml of okadaic acid and the linear portion is shown in Figure 6 (two crystals were used for each \npoint on the curve), and it was  linear up to 16 \u00b5g\/ml with a detection limit of 1.9 \u00b5g\/ml. An \nimmunosensor for okadaic acid based on the technique of screen-printing has been previously \nreported by Tang [21] and the detection limit and the sensitivity were orders of magnitude better \nthan piezoelectric immunosensor. To produce a satisfactory device for okadaic acid an attempt was \nmade to improve the performance of a piezoelectric immunosensor for okadaic acid by using an \nantibody-BSA gel. \n \n3.5. Improvement in sensitivity of piezoelectric sensor using an antibody-BSA hydrogel  \n     \n    Three batches of crystals with antibody-BSA gels were made and it was observed that antibody-\nBSA membranes for the first batch detached partially from crystal surfaces after measurements. \nThis can be explained by the fact that the antibody and BSA were not completely cross-linked \nwhen the sensors were placed in unsaturated glutaraldehyde vapour. Subsequent results showed \nthat a saturated glutaraldehyde vapour resulted in good adhesion of the membrane to the gold \nsurfaces of the crystals. \n     Five crystals were prepared with anti-okadaic acid antibody and bovine serum albumin gel \naccording to the immobilization procedures described above. The sensors were evaluated in a flow \ninjection system and the decreases in frequency were observed when okadaic acid solution was \nintroduced in the buffer flow. Each sensor could be used for a couple of measurements. A typical \nset of measurements for one crystal with three different concentrations of analyte (10, 25 and 50 \nng\/ml) showed that the frequency change of the sensor increased with the concentration of okadaic \nacid and reached a plateau at 50 ng\/ml of okadaic acid. By comparison, the lowest measurable \nconcentration of okadaic acid and the sensitivity of the sensor were improved by 524 and 80 fold, \nrespectively. A crystal with BSA gel only was studied as a control in the determination of okadaic \nacid. Decrease in frequency of the crystal was initially observed, but the oscillation frequency \nreturned to the baseline after continuously introducing the buffer flow. This phenomenon in the \ncontrol crystal can be explained by the fact that the oscillation frequency of crystal changed in \nresponse to the different composition of the sample solution in the buffer flow.  \n    Since a quartz crystal microbalance conventionally senses the mass change on its surface and \nokadaic acid is a small molecule, it is unlikely that direct binding of okadaic acid to immobilised \nantibody would result in a good detection limit and high sensitivity. We therefore conclude that the \noscillation frequency of crystals with hydrogel decreased due to a volume change of the gel \nresulting from the binding of okadaic acid to antibody recognition sites. \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe quartz crystal microbalance using polyethylenimine coupling with glutaraldehyde cross-\nlinking in conjunction with the competitive format was able to quantify okadaic acid in standard \nsolution. The polyethylenimine immobilisation with glutaraldehyde cross-linking was a successful \ncoupling method that produced a piezoelectric immunosensor with a good long-term storage \nlifetime of 38 days. However, the sensitivity of the device for okadaic acid was not satisfactory. \nThe antigen-sensitive hydrogel proved to be a useful approach for the development of a highly \nsensitive quartz crystal microbalance for okadaic acid. Initial results were very promising, \ndemonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in both the minimum amount of analyte \ndetectable and the sensitivity of the device. These improvements could pave the way for a practical \npiezoelectric immunosensor for environmental monitoring. Naturally, further optimisation is \nrequired to improve performance and to demonstrate the practical usefulness of this new approach \nfor okadaic acid in mussels.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n      \n    The authors would like to express their gratitude for the financial support from EU (QLKI-CT-\n1999-51197) and the EU Thematic Network SENSPOL (EVKI-CT-1999-20001). \n \nReferences \n \n[1] J.
