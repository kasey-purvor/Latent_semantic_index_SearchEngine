Introduction \n \nFuel cells represent a key technology in the delivery of clean energy for a future sustainable society. \nAlkaline polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (APEMFC) are a disruptive technology promising the \nability to use cheaper, more abundant, non\u2013platinum catalysts [1,2]; there is also growing evidence of their \nability to operate in the presence of carbonate anions [3,4]. \nIt is vitally important to understand the in situ single electrode performances during fuel cell testing of \nnew materials and components. A reference electrode (RE) is required to measure the individual anode and \ncathode potentials in fuel cells but the applicability of the commonly used three electrode configuration \n 2 \nalongside thin solid electrolytes is still being debated. The main concern is that the overpotentials and \nimpedance responses (impedance spectra) of the anode or cathode are a function of RE position and the \ndegree of misalignment of the active electrodes of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA); there have \nbeen extensive theoretical studies, involving simulation methods [5\u201313].  \nFor the planar geometry commonly used in fuel cell research, the inactive portion of the electrolyte is \napproximately equipotential at a distance of more than three electrolyte thicknesses from the edge of the \nactive region [7]. A slightly misaligned MEA strongly biases the potential of the inactive portion of the \nelectrolyte [7] and, as a consequence, the potential of a reference electrode located in this inactive area is \nbiased. This makes it impossible to measure the separate overpotential of an anode and a cathode accurately. \nThe situation is worse when trying to separate the impedance responses (on introduction of a.c. signals) of \nan anode and a cathode from the whole cell response, as the potential distributions in thin electrolytes are \nfrequency dependent [9,11\u201312]. \nThe prior simulation studies [11] show that the impedance of a half\u2013cell does not distort significantly \nwhen the active electrodes of a MEA are well aligned and the active electrodes of the MEAs have the same \nelectronic properties i.e. with the same electronic resistance (R) and capacitance (C). However, when the \nactive electrodes of the MEAs have different R and C characteristics, the impedance is distorted even when \nthe electrodes are precisely aligned [9,12]; Cimenti et al. has discussed the simulation results on this topic \nin detail [11\u201312]. Five different cell geometries are commonly encountered in the literature [14], with pellet \ngeometry and microfabricated microelectrode arrays being the two that are generally acknowledged to \nallow isolation of the impedance of working electrode; these geometries are, however, very different to the \nplanar structure encountered in fuel cells.  \nThe prior work of Piela et al. [15] found that the iR\u2013free individual electrode overpotentials can be \nmeasured with planar structured MEAs when placing a RE in ionic contact with the active layer of the fuel \ncell electrode of interest; this cleverly avoids the interfering potential distributions within the electrolyte \nwhen the RE is in contact with the protruding part of the electrolyte. As the RE was placed in the electrode \narea, the sensed overpotential was characteristic of a local overpotential rather than an average electrode \noverpotential. These local overpotentials were related to the fuel cell operating conditions. However, the \nmeaning of this local overpotential is ambiguous as it cannot be precisely defined due to the structure of the \n 3 \nMEA that was used. This limits the application of REs when detecting the local overpotential of an \nelectrode. On the other hand, the average overpotential of the electrode could only be measured under \ncertain conditions: This limits the application of the RE when detecting the average overpotential of the \nelectrode. Furthermore, it was also difficult to mould the RE into the system used.  \nThe premise of this study is that the RE can be located in the inactive electrolyte area outside the MEA \nso that accurate average overpotential of the electrode can be measured. In this case, it is crucial to \nunderstand the role of the RE in a 3\u2013electrode configuration with the application\u2013relevant planar structure. \nIn this study, the effect of the placement of the RE and the misalignment of the active electrodes of an \nalkaline MEA in an APEMFC were studied using multiple REs. The strategy employed to measure the \ngenuine impedance of a working electrode using the 3\u2013electrode method was to locate the RE as close as \npossible to working electrode. It is shown that the RE can be located at an equipotential surface close to the \nelectrode under study simply by careful control and optimisation of the MEA electrode misalignment. The \nuse of this method significantly alleviates electrolyte\u2013derived distortions in the measured impedance \nspectra. Although the experiments were conducted using alkaline MEAs in APEMFCs, the proposed \nmethod, in principle, should be applicable to any type of fuel cell or other electrochemical energy \nconversion device with thin planar geometry. \n \n2. Experimental \n \nA Pd coated Pt wire containing absorbed H (denoted (Pt)PdH) was used as the RE. The preparation and \nstability of this novel reference electrode were as previously reported [16]. In brief, Pd was \nelectrodeposited on the surface of Pt wire in aqueous (NH4)2PdCl4 (0.04 mol dm\u20133) containing HCl (aq, 1.0 \nmol dm\u20133), using a current density of 30 mA cm\u20132 (geometric). After deposition, the Pt\/Pd electrode was \ninitially charged at 30 mA cm\u20132 for 15 min (electrode cleaning procedure) and then at \u201330 mA cm\u20132 for 15 \nmin (H adsorption procedure) in either aqueous KOH (1 mol dm\u20133) or H2SO4 (aq, 1 mol dm\u20133). The MEAs, \nradiation\u2013grafted alkaline anion\u2013exchange membranes (AAEM), alkaline ionomer, and fuel cell test \nprocedures (at 50\u00b0C) were as previously reported [17\u201318]. The AAEMs used in the experiment were \n 4 \ndesignated S20 (20 \u03bcm thick when fully hydrated) and S80 (80 \u03bcm hydrated). To obtain a thicker AAEM \n(approximately 160 \u00b5m thick when hydrated), 2 \u00d7 S80 were used and assembled in situ. \nA Fuel Cell Test Station (Arbin instrument, USA) was used to keep the fuel cell running under \ncontrolled conditions, i.e. Tcell = 50\u00b0C, flow rates (H2 and O2) = 400 cm3 min\u20131, relative humidity RH = \n100%, and no back pressurization. The potentials and impedances between the active electrodes of the \nMEAs and the RE, between different REs, and the cell potential and impedance spectra using the 2\u2013\nelectrode (anode\u2013cathode) method were simultaneously recorded on a 1470E\/1455A CellTest system \n(Solartron Analytical, UK) with the simultaneous use of multiple channels. The impedance spectra were \nobtained over the frequency range 50 kHz \u2013 100 mHz, recorded at 10 steps decade\u20131, for each applied \nconstant d.c. current. The potentials corresponding to a particular applied d.c. current were recorded before \nand after the impedance measurement to confirm that the cell and the reference electrode (RE) were stable; \nresults were discarded if the cell potential varied by more than 20 mV. The open circuit voltages (OCV) of \nthe cell and potentials vs. RE were also recorded before and after all impedance measurements to check if \nthe RE potentials were still stable; results were discarded if the potential drift vs. RE was over 40 mV. The \nmean of cell voltage and the potential vs. RE were the average data when the cell was stable at each applied \nd.c. current step. \nThe different positions of the various REs and misplacement of the active electrodes of MEA used in this \nstudy are defined in Scheme 1. The size of the MEA electrodes are 25 mm \u00d7 25 mm when fully aligned \n(symmetrical). When misaligned, the anode and cathode (of the same composition) had a geometric area \n(25 mm \u00d7 D) with D was reduced from 25 mm to 20 mm. When the electrodes of the MEA were \nmisaligned, the electrolyte area in close proximity to the cathode is designated the cathode area, and the \narea in close proximity to the anode is designated the anode area. The different REs are denoted as REi or \nREj; more specifically, the RE in the cathode area is denoted REc and the RE in the anode area is denoted \nREa. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1 Comparison of the novel (Pt)PdH RE to an established Ag\/AgCl RE \n 5 \n \nAfter the (Pt)PdH RE was charged with adsorbed H2, the stability of the novel (Pt)PdH RE was \ncompared to an Ag\/AgCl RE is shown in Figure 1. The potential of (Pt)PdH RE vs. Ag\/AgCl RE was \nrecorded in aqueous H2SO4 (1 mol dm\u20133) and KOH (1 mol dm\u20133) without H2 purge. It was clear that there \nwere two stable potentials when using the (Pt)PdH RE; this was caused by the H2 absorption property of \nthe Pd as discussed in detail in our previous work [16], which also highlighted the stability of the (Pt)PdH \nRE in APEMFCs. This is confirmed again with the data presented in Figure 7: The potential of the (Pt)PdH \nRE did not change before and after the test. It is important that the high potential state of the (Pt)PdH RE is \nstable without the need to supply H2 as this allows for the RE to be easy moulded into the fuel cell system. \n \n3.2 The overpotential of anode and cathode vs. different reference electrodes \n \nTypical anode and cathode potentials vs. different REs, when the active electrodes of MEA were \nmisaligned by d = 2.5 mm, are presented in Figure 2. The \u201ckink\u201d in the middle of the cell polarization curve \nwas not caused by the use of the REs: No kinks are observed when other MEAs are tested using the same \nRE. This MEA was deliberately chosen because such unusual behaviour would allow clear indications of \nanode and cathode performances when the cell performance of the cell changed so dramatically. The \ndirectly measured cell voltage (2\u2013electrode method) is equal to potential of cathode vs. REc (or REa) minus \npotential of anode vs. REc (or REa). The potential of anode vs. REa (and REc) changed in a similar manner \nto the deterioration of the whole cell response at higher current densities. Although the overpotential of the \ncathode vs. REa was much bigger than overpotential of cathode vs. REc, the overpotential of cathode vs. \nREa or REc changed less significantly when the performance of cell deteriorated. In all the tests conducted, \nthe potential of the anode vs. REi increased noticeably unlike the potential of cathode vs. REi, when the \nperformance of cell deteriorated. This implies that the deterioration in cell performance was ascribed to the \nincreasing overpotential of anode (i.e. the cell performance is primarily controlled by the overpotential of \nanode). However, there is a significant discrepancy between the potential of the anode (or the cathode) vs. \nREa and vs. REc. The physical meaning of the difference in potential of the active electrode vs. REa and REc \nis unclear. To investigate, the cell configurations detailed in Scheme 1 were utilised. \n 6 \n \n3.3 Direct current (d.c.) experiments \n \nFigure 3 presents the idealized equivalent circuit descriptions of the fuel cells under test when the RE is \nlocated at different positions in the solid electrolyte. Points i and j represent the equipotential surfaces \nwhere the REs are located. Under d.c. conditions, pure resistances (R) are considered. In the discussions \nbelow, V represents the experimentally determined voltages and \u03c6 represents the real potential. Hence, \u03c6a is \nthe real potential of the anode, \u03c6c is the potential of cathode, \u03c6REi is the intrinsic potential of the RE at point \ni, VA\/B is the experimental potential of \u201cgeneric electrode A\u201d vs. \u201cgeneric electrode B\u201d (i.e. VA\/B = VA \u2013 VB \n= \u2013 (VB \u2013VA) = \u2013 VB\/A), Vanode\/REi is the experimental potential between anode and REi, Vcathode\/REi is the \nexperimental potential between cathode and REi, and Rcell is the resistance of the cell, which is assumed \nequal to the resistance of the membrane plus the contact resistance between the active electrodes and \nmembrane (R). \u03c6REi = \u03c6REj  because the intrinsic potential of the reference electrodes are the same. \nThe intrinsic potential of the RE is set as the baseline reference in the below equations. Under d.c. \nconditions,  \nVanode\/REi = \u03c6a \u2013 (\u03c6REi \u2013 IRi1)                                                                                          1.1 \nVcathode\/REi= \u03c6c \u2013 (\u03c6REi + IRi2)                                                                                         1.2 \nRcell = R = Ri1 + Ri2 = Rj1 + Rj2                                                                                      1.3 \n\u03c6REi = \u03c6REj                                                                                                                      1.4    \nVcathode \u2013Vanode = Vcathode\/REi \u2013 Vanode\/REi  \n                         = \u03c6c \u2013 \u03c6a \u2013 IRi2 \u2013 IRi1 = \u03c6c \u2013 \u03c6a \u2013 I(Ri1 + Ri2)  \n                         = \u03c6c \u2013 \u03c6a \u2013 IR = Vcell                                                                              1.5   \nFor REs at different position, the potential between the reference electrodes in the electric field is \nVREi\/REj = VREi \u2013 VREj = Vanode\/REj \u2013Vanode\/REi  \n= (\u03c6REi \u2013 IRi1) \u2013 (\u03c6REj \u2013 IRj1) = I(Rj1 \u2013 Ri1)                                                         1.6 \nAs Rj1 \u2013 Ri1 \u2260 0, the potential between different reference electrodes changes linearly in terms of current. \nIf VREi \u2013 VREj > 0, then Rj1 \u2013 Ri1 >0 and the potential of REi is therefore closer to anode potential. If VREi \u2013 \n 7 \nVREj = 0 (the potential between the REs does not change in terms of current), then Rj1 = Ri1 and this \nindicates that the reference electrodes are located at the equipotential surface of the electric field.  \nAccording to equation 1.5, the potential between the anode and cathode tested by the same RE is equal \nto the directly measured Vcell, which is verified by the experimental results presented in Figure 2 (and \nconsistent with a previous study [19]). As shown in equation 1.1 and 1.2, the tested potential between the \nactive electrodes and the RE includes the partial potential loss of the electrolyte. This suggests that when \nVcathode \u2013Vanode = Vcell, the measured potentials between the active electrodes and the RE fail to represent the \ntrue potential of the individual cell electrodes. \nAs the potential differences defined above involve partial potential losses due to the solid electrolyte, it \nis necessary to study the potential distribution within the electrolyte, more specifically the potential \ndistribution in the inactive area of the membrane (outside the MEA active area). The different RE positions \nand misplacement of the active electrodes of MEA are defined in Scheme 1, with a typical result (for \nscenario (d) in Scheme 1) shown in Figure 4. The potential between the two REs increased or decreased \napproximately linearly as a function of current, which is consistent with equation 1.6. The results showed \nthat the potential difference between two REs located in the same inactive area of the membrane (with \nmisaligned MEA electrodes) were < 50 mV when the REs were located < 9 mm apart and in the middle of \nthe membrane (between 2 AAEMs pressed together). Similar results were achieved for the other \nexperimental scenarios presented in Scheme 1. In brief, the potential distribution around a single inactive \narea of the membrane is pseudo\u2013uniform (within the tolerances discussed above). The potential of a RE is \nnot sensitive to the position within an inactive area, which is consistent with the previous studies [7] i.e. the \npotential outside the MEA, > 3 \u00d7 l (membrane thickness) away from the edge of the MEA, is uniform no \nmatter whether the MEA electrodes were misaligned or not. As can be seen in Figure 4 with a misaligned \nMEA, VRE1\/RE3 and VRE2\/RE3 were positive and VRE5\/RE4 was negative in terms of current. So the potential at \nthe cathode area decreased slightly away from MEA edge, whilst the potential at the anode area increased \nslightly away from MEA edge (a phenomenon that may be caused by stray currents within the same \ninactive area). \nConversely, the potential difference between two REs located at different inactive areas (cathode area or \nanode area) changed significantly as a function of current (> 200 mV for VRE5\/RE3 in Figure 4). The \n 8 \npotential differences between REs in different inactive areas were typically in the range 60 \u2013 200 mV. \nFigure 5 shows the potential difference between two REs located in different inactive area when the MEA \nelectrodes were aligned as precisely as possible (d = \u00b1 0.5 mm). For example VRE5\/RE2 can be positive or \nnegative (when the MEA electrodes were deliberately misaligned all such potentials were positive). The \npotential difference between RE5 and RE2 is therefore correlated to the misalignment of the MEA (due to \nits sensitivity to small degrees of misalignment). Based on our assumption, RE2 should be located in a \nhigher potential area on MEA misalignment (i.e. the cathode area where RE2 is located has a higher \npotential and the anode area where RE5 is located has a lower potential). On the basis of the experimental \nobservations, the potential distribution at the inactive areas of the membrane is suggested in Figure 6. \nWhen the current is stepped from one current to another, there is always a delayed potential response as \nshown in Figure 7, with MEA misalignments of 1.5 \u2013 2 mm (scheme 1d). OCVb represents the open circuit \nvoltage (OCV) before the fuel cell had undergone current discharge, and OCVa represents the OCV after \nthe cell testing was complete. Times of 100 s or more were often required to obtain stabilized potentials. \nHence, using voltammetric sweep measurements will involve errors even with scan rates as slow as 5 mV \ns\u20131. To alleviate errors originating from the voltage transients, the fuel cells were discharged under constant \ncurrent mode with MEAs misaligned at d \u2264 \u00b1 0.5 mm (aligned), d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm, 2.5 \u2013 3.0 mm, 5.0 \u2013 5.5 \nmm (Figure 8). The solid electrolyte used was two 2 \u00d7 S80 AAEMs assembled together in situ with the \nREs located between the two membranes to lower the contact resistance between RE and the membrane. \nThe error bars in Figure 8 indicate the maximum drift of the potentials during each test step with each \nconstant current discharge when the cell is \u201cstable\u201d (typical shifts of 5 \u2013 20 mV). The standard deviations \nof the recorded potentials were typically less than \u00b1 8 mV. The potentials between the anode and the RE at \nanode area was denoted as Va, between the cathode and the RE at cathode area was denoted as Vc, and \nbetween the RE at anode area and the RE at cathode area was denoted as VREa\/REc. VREa\/REc increased \nlinearly with current and the slope of the linear regression line was less than the cell resistance measured \nusing the electrochemcial impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method [2] when d \u2264 \u00b1 0.5 mm (aligned MEA). \nHowever, the slopes matched the EIS cell resistances well (close to the IR line) when the MEA mismatch \nwas increased to d =1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm. The VREa\/REc regression lines were ca. 50 mV higher, but parallel to, the \nIR plots with increased misalignment (when d = 2.5 \u2013 3.0 mm and 5.0 \u2013 5.5mm). As the slopes of VREa\/REc \n 9 \nvs. current matched Rcell values with MEA misalignments of \u2265 1.5 mm, it is hypothesised that the potential \ndifference between REa and REc originated from Rcell. Generally the Rcell includes electronic, ionic and \ncontact resistances. Based on the results, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Rcell mainly consists of the \nmembrane resistance and the contact resistances between the active electrodes and the membrane. The \nmisalignment of the MEA locates REc at an equipotential surface that is close to the potential of cathode \n(and vice versa for the REa). When the MEA is misaligned by \u2265 1.5 mm, REa and REc are hypothesised to \nbe at the equipotential surfaces shown in Figure 3(b). \nWhen the MEA was deliberately misaligned from \u00b1 0.5 mm, (Vc \u2013 Va) went from being < (Vcell + IR) in \nthe aligned state to (Vc \u2013 Va) = (Vcell + IR) with d = 1.5 \u2013 2 mm (where the slope of VREa\/REc was also equal \nto Rcell). The values of (Vc \u2013 Va) measured were about 50 mV greater than (Vcell + IR) when the MEA \nmisalignment was increased to 2.5 \u2013 3.0 mm and 5 \u2013 5.5 mm. The test was repeated several times with d = \n2.5 mm and (Vc \u2013 Va) was always ca. 50mV greater than (Vcell + IR); this cannot be written off as simply \nthe indeterminate errors of the test.  \nThe experimental results presented above suggest that there are two critical misalignment regimens: (1) \nd \u2248 0 mm and (2) d = 1.5 \u2013 2 mm. When d was within \u00b1 0.5 mm, the potential between REs in different \nactive areas changed significantly in terms of current (positive or negative depending on if d > 0 mm or < 0 \nmm). When d > 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm, (Vc \u2013 Va) increased to 50 mV higher than (Vcell + IR) where it remained \nunchanged even when d was increased to 5 \u2013 5.5 mm. When misalignment was 1.5 \u2013 2 mm, (Vc \u2013 Va) was \nvery close to (Vcell + IR). If we measure the potential of anode vs. REa and the potential of cathode vs. REc \nwith +1.5 mm misalignment of the MEA electrodes, reasonably accurate values of the anode and cathode \noverpotentials can be determined. The difference between (Vc \u2013 Va) and (Vcell + IR) is a useful parameter to \njudge if the electrodes of MEA are optimally misaligned.  \nIn summary, the potential between anode and cathode was separated into three components with the use \nof two REs located in the anode and cathode inactive areas respectively, and with misalignment of the \nMEA such that (Vc \u2013 Va) = (Vcell + IR), i.e. Vtot = |Vc| + |Va| + |Vm| =\u03c6c \u2013\u03c6a \u2013 IR. In this case, REa and REc \nwere located at an equipotential surface depicted in Figure 3(b). Vc and Va adequately represent the \npotentials of cathode and anode respectively. The difference between the electrode potentials vs. REa and \nREc (shown in Figure 2) is caused by the IR drop of membrane and the contact resistance between the \n 10 \nactive electrodes and the membrane. The potential between cathode vs. REc and the potential between \nanode vs. REa will represent the real potential of the cathode and anode with optimal MEA misalignment. \nTsutsum et al. [20] also suggest the misalignment of the MEA to exclude the effect of the cell internal \nresistance so that the potential of a single electrode can be measured. This is highly consistent with our \nstudy. As shown in Fig. 8(a), a slightly misaligned MEA (\u2264 0.5 mm) significantly reduces the effect of the \ncell resistance as there is only about 30 mV difference between (Vc \u2013 Va) and (Vcell + IR). This means it is \npossible to record the potentials of single electrodes with MEA misalignments of 0.5 mm. However, such \nsmall misalignments are not enough to record the a.c. impedance spectrum of a single electrode (this will \nbe discussed in detail in section 3.4). A non\u2013systemic study (not shown in this paper) suggests that the best \nmisalignment distance d is related to membrane thickness L. It is important to find the relationship between \nthe misalignment distance d and L so that a general criterion can be applied to different systems where the \nmembrane thicknesses are different. This needs a more precise alignment technology current impossible for \nour state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art MEA preparing process, this will be discussed in a later study.  \n \n3.4 Alternating current (a.c.) experiments (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS) \n \nFor the a.c. experiments with constant d.c. current discharges, small a.c. current perturbations were \napplied to the system under load. The impedance of the reference electrode was very small and is assumed \nto not change in terms of frequency. As described in equation 1.1, Vanode\/REi = \u03c6a \u2013 (\u03c6REi \u2013 IRi1). When an \na.c. current signals were introduced, only a.c. potential (and current) responses were recorded. The a.c. \npotential signal recorded was \u0168  anode\/REi = \u03c8a + \u0128Z i1 where \u0168 , \u03c8a, \u0128 and Z represent, respectively, the a.c. \nresponse of the measured potential, the real a.c. potential response of the anode, the total a.c. cell current \nand the impedance of membrane and contact resistance between the active electrodes and membrane. Even \nif the electrolyte resistance does not change with frequency (Z = R), \u0128R is still frequency dependent because \nof the term \u0128. At a given frequency (f), electrodes with very different time constants will generate different \npotential distributions at the electrode\/electrolyte interfaces, causing the potential distributions inside the \nelectrolyte to change with frequency [11\u201312]. This leads to a complicated influence of the electrolyte on the \nEIS responses. As shown above in Figure 3(b), when the electrodes of MEA are controllably misaligned, \n 11 \nRi1 = Rj2 = 0, Rj1 = Ri2 = R, and so as Zi1 = Zj2 = 0, Zj1 = Zi2 =Z. So, \u0168  anode\/REi = \u03c8a, which means that the \nimpedance spectrum acquired vs. REi at the equipotential surface in the anode active area in close \nproximity to the anode is the true impedance of anode (and vice versa for impedance of cathode). \nUnder the conditions defined in Figure 3(a),  \n\u0168anode\/REi = \u03c8a + \u0128Zi1                                                                                                       1.7 \n\u0168cathode\/REj = \u03c8c \u2013 \u0128Zj2                                                                                                     1.8 \n\u0168REi\/REj = \u0128Zj1 \u2013 \u0128Zi1                                                                                                       1.9 \nZ = Zi1 + Zi2 = Zj1 + Zj2                                                                                                 1.10 \nWhen using a single RE, \n\u0168cathode\/REi \u2013 \u0168anode\/REi =\u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128Zi2 \u2013 \u0128Zi1 = \u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128(Zi1 + Zi2)  \n                                    = \u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128Z = \u0168cell                                                         1.11 \nWhen using two REs, \u0168cathode\/REi, \u0168anode\/REi and \u0168REi\/REj were measured, \n\u0168cathode\/REj \u2013 \u0168anode\/REi \u2013 \u0168REi\/REj  \n                      = \u03c8c \u2013 \u0128Zj2 \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128Zi1 \u2013 \u0128Zj1 + \u0128Zi1 \n                      = \u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128(Zj1 + Zj2)  \n                      = \u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128Z = \u0168cell                                                                              1.12 \nWhen the two REs located at the equal potential positions in Figure 3(b), \nZi1 = Zj2 = 0, Zj1 = Zi2 =Z                                                                                            1.13 \n\u0168cathode\/REc \u2013 \u0168anode\/REa \u2013 \u0168REi\/REj  \n                      = \u03c8c \u2013 \u03c8a \u2013 \u0128Z = \u0168cell                                                                             1.14 \nThe equations above suggest that  \nZtot = \u0168cell \/ \u0128 = Z cathode\/REi + Z REi\/anode                                                                          1.15 \nZtot = \u0168cell \/ \u0128 = Zcathode\/REj + Z REi\/anode + ZREj\/REi                                                            1.16 \nEquations 1.15 and 1.16 are consistent with the experimental results obtained where the calculated total \ncell impedance spectra (sum of the impedance spectra listed above) were equal to the measured whole cell \nimpedance spectra (simultaneously recorded between the anode and cathode using the 2\u2013electrode method), \napart from small discrepancies at high frequencies (Figure 9 \u2013 10 relates to equation 1.15, Figure 11 relates \n 12 \nto equation 1.16). Equation 1.15 is also consistent with previous studies [20,21] that showed that the sum of \nthe anode and cathode impedance spectra vs. the same RE was equal to the impedance spectrum of the cell. \nThe a.c. impedance spectra vs. different REs would only be the same if the REs are located at the same \nequipotential surface under a.c. conditions. Figure 9 shows the results when REs located in the same \ninactive area (Figure 9 should be consulted alongside Scheme 1) with aligned anode and cathode. The \npotentials between REs at opposite points of the same inactive area changed less than 5 mV as a function of \ncurrent, which was smaller than the potential drifts of the REs (not shown in Figure 4 for clarity). Figure \n9(a) clearly shows that the impedance spectra vs. different REs were the same, with aligned anode and \ncathode (Scheme 1a); this was also true with misaligned anode and cathode (Scheme 1c). However in \nFigure 9(b) with misalignment of d = 2.5 mm, the EIS spectra parallel shifted but with retention of the \nspectral form (shape). These observations occurred with all the scenarios depicted in Scheme 1 when \ndifferent REs were located in the same inactive area. The sum of the anode and cathode impedances vs. the \nsame RE (denoted as Calcul Cell in Figure 9) matched the measured whole cell impedance (2\u2013electrode \nmeasurement). The impedance spectral features vs. different REs located in the same inactive area \nremained effectively the same in shape and magnitude, which means they are insensitive to the position of \nREs in the same inactive area. This also suggests that the REs are located on comparatively equipotential \nsurfaces in these a.c. experiments. As long as there is only a small potential difference between the two \nreference electrodes as a function of current, there were only small differences in the form of the resulting \nimpedance spectra; the resistances measured from the high\u2013f x\u2013axis intercepts were, however, sensitive to \nthe small potential differences between the two reference electrodes. \nThis situation was very different when the REs were located in different inactive areas. Despite the \npotential difference of such REs being < 50 mV at 360 mA cm\u20132 (Figure 5(b)) with well aligned MEAs, the \nimpedance spectra obtained vs. the different REs were markedly different (Figure 10). As discussed in \nsection 3.3 (and defined in Scheme 1), RE5 is located at the cathode inactive area while RE2 is located at \nthe anode inactive area. It was clear that, even at a low current density of 40 mA cm\u20132, there was a clear \ndifference between the cathode impedance spectra vs. RE5 and vs. RE2 (Figure 10(a)). The impedance of \nthe anode did not conspicuously change (as it was larger in magnitude), whilst the impedance of the \ncathode vs. the different REs was radically different at 240 mA cm\u20132 (Figure 10(b)). The cathode \n 13 \nimpedance spectrum vs. RE2 contained a substantial inductive loop at lower frequencies. These results \nsuggest that the potential distributions within inactive areas are uniform under both a.c. and d.c. test \nconditions, but are substantially different between different inactive areas under a.c. test conditions (even if \nthe potential differences between different inactive area was small under d.c. test conditions). This suggests \nthat the potential distribution within the cathode inactive area is dominated by the cathode and is uniform \nwith both d.c. and a.c. test conditions (vice versa with regards to the anode inactive area). This also \nsuggests that the potential distributions under d.c. conditions correspond to the potential distributions under \na.c. conditions as the potential difference between REs located at different inactive areas is different from \nthe potential differences between REs within the same inactive area (one represents the IR drop or partial \nIR drop of the membrane, one represents the potential difference caused by stray currents). \nThe impedance spectrum of the cathode vs. RE2 (Figure 10(b) inset) was equal to the sum of the cathode \nvs. RE5 and RE5 vs. RE2 impedance spectra (also true for anode spectra), and hence the differences \nbetween the impedance spectra of the cathode (anode) vs. different REs derive from the different responses \nof the two REs. For more clarity, Figure 11 shows two typical measurements of the effect of the RE \nresponse between REi and REj when located within the cathode inactive area (Figure 11(a)) and at different \ninactive areas(Figure 11(b)); the small and big differences between the electrode impedance spectra vs. \ndifferent REs, when the REs were co\u2013located within the same inactive area (Figure 9(b)) and when located \nat different inactive areas respectively (Figure 10), can be accounted for by the differences in response \nbetween the two REs. The impedance spectra of the cathode vs. REc and REa, and anode vs. REc and REa \nwith MEA misalignment of d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm are presented in Figure 12. Due to the MEA symmetry, the \nimpedance of the electrode vs. REc relates to d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm, whilst the impedance of the electrode vs. \nREa relates to d = \u2013(1.5 \u2013 2.0) mm. The impedance spectrum of the cathode vs. REa is right\u2013shifted \ncompared to the cathode vs. REc with an arc of increased magnitude and a manifest low\u2013f inductive loop; \nthe impedance spectrum of the anode vs. REc is right\u2013shifted compared to the spectrum of the anode vs. \nREa (identical right\u2013shift magnitude to that observed on switching to the cathode vs. REa from the cathode \nvs. REc responses). The high frequency resistances (high\u2013f x\u2013axis intercept) of the anode (also cathode) vs. \nREa and REc were clearly different; the anode\/REc response had a similar profile compared to the anode vs. \nREa response and was only slightly bigger in magnitude. This behaviour compares well to the results \n 14 \nreported from prior simulation studies [11\u201312]. The inset in Figure 12 gives the impedance response \nbetween REc and REa; this was comparable in magnitude to cathode vs. REa\/REc responses but was much \nsmaller than anode vs. REa\/REc responses. There was a significant difference between the impedance \nspectra of cathode vs. REa and vs. REc, but only a slight difference between the impedance spectrum of \nanode vs. REa and vs. REc. This again confirms that the difference between the impedance spectra of each \nelectrode vs. different REs was caused by the differing responses of the two REs. \nThe MEAs with different anode\u2013cathode misalignments had different impedance responses (Figure \n13(a); related d.c. performances are found in Figure 8), whilst the overpotential of the cathode vs. REc did \nnot change significantly. As this implies that the cathode responses in all tests were similar, the cathode \nresponses can be used to judge the effect of MEA misalignment. The impedance response of the cathode vs. \nREc became smaller in magnitude from 0 < d < 0.5 mm to d = 2.5 \u2013 3.0 mm, but then stabilised in \nmagnitude (with a similar profile) for d = 2.5 \u2013 5.5 mm, as presented in Figure 13(b); this is consistent with \nthe d.c. results (when d = 2.5 \u2013 5.5 mm, (Vc \u2212 Va) \u2212 (Vcell + IR) = ca. 50 mV and did not increase further). \nThe significant low frequency semicircles in the impedance spectra of the cathode with d = 2.5\u20133.0 mm and \nd = 5.0\u20135.5 mm in Figure 13(b) correlate with the mass transport phenomena that are typically observed in \nsuch cells. However, the medium frequency semicircle at d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm was larger than that at d = 2.5 \u2013 \n3.0mm and 5.0 \u2013 5.5 mm; this is further confirmation of the earlier assertion that the observation that (Vc \u2212 \nVa) was 50mV higher than (Vcell + IR) was not due to indeterminate experiment\u2013derived errors.  \nThe results discussed above for the a.c. experiments correlate well to those obtained in the d.c. studies. \nThe overpotential of each electrode under d.c. discharge determined the impedance spectrum of that \nelectrode. Analysis of the d.c. responses suggest that the impedance spectra recorded for the cathode vs. \nREc and anode vs. REa do represent the true impedance responses of the cathode and anode with an \noptimally misaligned MEA (d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0mm with the cell configuration and the MEAs used in this study). \nAlthough the impedance spectrum of cathode was similar when d = 2.5 \u2013 5.5 mm, an underestimation of \nthe impedance of the electrode is possible because (Vc \u2212 Va) was ca. 50mV higher than (Vcell + IR), i.e. Vc \nand Va partially sense the potentials of the cathode and the anode. The distortions of the impedance \nresponses were caused by the frequency dependent potential distributions in the electrolyte. As the potential \ndistribution in the electrolyte is related to the anode and cathode, the impedance spectrum between REa and \n 15 \nREc can be attributed to the response of the electrolyte and the \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between anode and cathode \nthrough the electrolyte. By subtracting the impedance response of REc\/REa from the impedance responses \nof the anode vs. REc and cathode vs REa, the impedance spectra of anode vs REa and cathode vs. REc are \nconsistent with the overpotentials of anode and cathode measured in the d.c. experiments. \nAs mentioned in section 3.3, with small MEA misalignments (ca. 0.5 mm), as presented in Fig 8(a), the \ndifference between (Vc \u2013 Va) and (Vcell + IR) is only 30 mV. This is good enough to measure the potentials \nof the single electrodes. However, the magnitude of the cathode impedance spectrum is significant different \n(but with the same form). This suggests that the impedance spectrum of a single electrode can be optained \nonly when the MEA is optimally misaligned.  \nPrior simulation studies [9] suggest the primary and secondary potential distributions in thin solid \nelectrolytes are different for planar structure systems and that it is impossible to measure the true \nimpedance of the working electrode in such a configuration; these studies indicate that it is difficult to \nensure that the primary and secondary potential distributions are the same, even if the cell geometry is well \ndesigned. However, the experimental results presented above suggest that it is possible to locate RE in \nclose proximity to the working electrode (Figure 3b) by optimally misaligning the MEA electrodes to \nminimize the interferences derived from the response of the electrolyte; the potential difference between \nREa and REc is primarily dictated by the membrane resistance. The impedance spectrum of the cathode \nremained unchanged with misalignments of d \u2265 2.5mm in the systems tested. Although these experimental \nresults support the majority of the prior simulation results [11\u201312], there are some discrepancies. These \nlikely originate from the different geometry of the electrodes used (circular in simulation studies and square \nin this study). As discussed in section 3.3, the real overpotentials of anode and cathode can be determined \nonly when the MEA electrodes were misaligned in a narrow range (to allow the real impedance of anode \nand cathodes to be measured). However, there have been no simulation studies involving the misalignment \nof MEA electrodes over such a narrow range.  \nBased on the analysis above, the impedance spectra of the anode vs. REa and the cathode vs. REc can \nbe considered as the real impedance spectra of the electrodes when the MEA is misaligned by d = 1.5 \u2013 2.0 \nmm in the systems studied. The results from comprehensive utilisation of the REs in fuel cell testing \n(Figure 14) show that three different \u201ctypes\u201d of impedance spectra can be identified. The time constant of \n 16 \ncathode arc was frequency dependent, whereas the time constant of anode arc was relatively insensitive to \nfrequency with different constant current cell discharges. The anode impedance response contains \nsignificant and complex mass transport interferences due to the water generation at anode [16]. The \nREc\/REa impedance spectra exhibit an inductive loop at lower frequencies. \nAssigning the distortion of impedance responses of the anode and cathode to the frequency dependent \nresponse of electrolyte facilitates interpretation of the results; small and controlled MEA electrode \nmisalignment results in significant differences between the impedance spectra vs. REa and REc (the \npotential of cathode inert area is dominated by cathode and the potential of anode inert area is dominated \nby anode). The small magnitude impedance of the cathode vs. REa was distorted significantly by inclusion \nof the frequency dependent electrolyte response i.e. the low\u2013f inductive loop in the REc\/REa impedance \nspectra is the source of the inductive loop in the impedance spectrum of cathode vs. REa (Figure 12). The \nimpedances of the anode vs. REc and REa were similar because they were significantly larger in magnitude \nthan the frequency dependent electrolyte responses. It is clear that only when the impedance of the \nelectrode is comparable to or smaller in magnitude than the frequency dependent response of the electrolyte \nwill the distortion of the electrode impedance response become significant. In this study, the performance \nunder d.c. conditions determined the a.c. responses. The potential difference between REa and REc with \noptimally misaligned MEA electrodes represents the response of the membrane (the ohmic IR drop of the \nmembrane and the contact resistances between the electrodes and membrane) during d.c. discharge and the \noverpotentials and the impedances of the anode and cathode can be separated; the impedances of the anode \nand the cathode can be measured on subtracting the frequency dependent response of membrane. Making \nthe stated assumptions, the real impedance of anode and cathode can be determined, i.e. the impedance of \nanode vs. REa (located in anode area) and the impedance of cathode vs. REc (located in cathode area) \nrepresent the real impedance of anode and cathode respectively when the MEA is optimally misaligned. \nThis is an important result which makes it clear that optimal misalignment of the MEA is necessary to \ndetermine the impedance of a single electrode and that it is possible to get the impedance of a single \nelectrode when using the applicant\u2013relevant planar MEA configurations. \nThe d.c. results suggest that if membrane resistance and contact resistance between the active electrode \nand membrane themselves are not frequency dependent, the high frequency resistance in the impedance \n 17 \nspectrum between REc and REa will be considered as the resistance of the membrane and the contact \nresistance between the active electrode and membrane; the high frequency resistance of the impedance \nspectrum between REc and REa is equal to Rcell. This cannot, however, be true because the high frequency \nresistance (from the x\u2013axis intercept) of the cathode vs. REc (or anode vs. REa) is dependent on the exact \nposition of the RE. In Figure 9(b), where RE3 was closer to the cathode than RE1 the high frequency \nresistance of cathode vs. RE3 was smaller (similar results were obtained with the other configurations \ndefined in Scheme 1). The high frequency resistance shifted according to the potentials of the REs because \nthey exhibit a small variation when located at different positions within the same inactive area. The results \nin section 3.3 indicate that the potentials within the cathode inactive area decreased, and the potentials \nwithin the anode inactive area increased, when shifting the location further away from MEA edge. This is \nindicative of the REs not being located exactly at the equipotential surface of the electric field (Figure 3), \ndue to the presence of stray currents in the electrolyte. The potential difference between REc and REa was \nsmaller than the assumed potential difference between the two equipotential surfaces; the high frequency \n(x\u2013axis intercept) resistance of the REc\/REa impedance response will consequently be smaller than the \nassumed resistance of the membrane and the contact resistances between the electrodes and membrane. \nThis makes the physical meaning of high frequency resistances measured using the REs ambiguous.  \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe a.c. impedance response of an electrode can be determined when measured vs. a reference electrode \nlocated with an area of the membrane that is adjacent to the electrode. Deliberate and optimal misalignment \nof the MEA electrodes ensures that the potential in the inactive electrolyte area adjacent to the cathode (the \ncathode area) is dominated by cathode and the potential at the inactive electrolyte area adjacent to the \nanode (the anode area) is dominated by anode when conducting both d.c. and a.c. electrochemical \nexperiments. VREa\/REc, the potential between reference electrodes located in the anode (REa) and cathode \n(REc) areas, relates to the IR drop of the electrolyte and contact resistances between the electrodes and the \nelectrolyte. The difference between the tested potential of cathode vs REc minus the potential of anode vs. \nREa (Vc \u2212 Va) and the IR corrected cell potential (Vcell + IR) can be used to judge the optimal misalignment \n 18 \nof the MEA. When (Vc \u2212 Va) \u2248 (Vcell + IR), the overpotentials and impedances of the cathode and anode \ncan be separately measured after subtraction of the frequency dependent response of the electrolyte where \nappropriate. In the system used in this study, the optimal electrode misalignment is 1.5 \u2013 2.0 mm. A future \nstudy will be conducted to find the relationship between d and L to guide the misalignment of MEA in \ndifferent systems. \nBased on this study, to obtain the real potential and impedance of a single fuel cell electrode containing \nplanar MEAs we suggest: \n1. Locate two spatially separated REs in anode and cathode inactive areas of the respectively. To \ncorrectly misalign the MEA, a test should be run to make sure that (Vc \u2013 Va) \u2248 (Vcell + IR) to determine the \noptimal misalignment distance d. The impedance of anode and cathode may be underestimated with over \nmisalignment or overestimated with not enough misalignment.  \n2. The impedance and potential of anode is obtained by measuring the anode properties vs. REa while \nthe impedance and potential of cathode is obtained by measuring the cathode properties vs. REc. These are \nthe real impedance and potentials of single electrodes because the response due to the membrane is already \nsubtracted from the response between the single electrodes and REs (anode vs. REa and cathode vs. REc) \ndue to the optimal misalignment of the MEA. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe authors thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK, Grant EP\/F027524\/1) \nand the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory for funding.
