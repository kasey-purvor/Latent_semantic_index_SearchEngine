Easy solutions are unlikely, given the\ncomplex interaction between the abundant availability\nof energy dense food, the ever decreasing demand for\nenergy expenditure in the modern world, and the\nimpact of our genetic make up. Treatment of people\nwho are already obese is difficult; however, several sys-\ntematic reviews in recent years have shown that diet,\nexercise, and behavioural approaches, used in combi-\nnation, are effective management strategies, at least in\nthe short term.1 2\nThe role of primary care in managing obesity in\nthe United Kingdom is linked to achieving targets for\nthe national service framework for coronary heart dis-\nease.3 The Department of Health stated that primary\ncare should \u201cuse every opportunity to promote healthy\nlifestyles\u201d and should provide advice on diet, weight\nreduction, and exercise.4 A survey of general practi-\ntioners and practice nurses by the National Audit\nOffice identified several factors that they felt would\nassist them in the treatment of patients, including more\ninformation on effective interventions, availability of\nbetter materials for advising patients, and better train-\ning for staff.5 Little is known about how effective such\ntraining is in helping primary care teams to manage\nobesity more effectively. A systematic review of\ninterventions to improve health professionals\u2019 man-\nagement of obesity in 1999 found little rigorous\nresearch from which to draw conclusions.6\nWe have evaluated, in a cluster randomised trial, a\ntraining programme (the intervention) promoting the\nevidence based treatment of obesity, delivered to\ngeneral practice teams (unit of randomisation).\nAlthough many trials have measured the effectiveness\nof training, few have measured effectiveness at the level\nof health outcomes in patients. The primary outcome\nmeasure in this study was difference in patients\u2019 weight,\nbut we also measured difference in practitioners\u2019\nknowledge and behaviour in weight management\nconsultations.\nMethods\nThe method has been reported in detail elsewhere.7\nFigures 1 and 2 show the flow of practices, staff, and\npatients through the trial.\nRecruitment\nWe recruited practices from four health authority areas\nin the Northern and Yorkshire region of England\nduring a four month period. We invited all 161\npractices in selected primary care groups to partici-\npate, of which we randomised 44 (without financial\nincentives): 12 in North Durham, 16 in Leeds, 10 in\nNewcastle, and 6 in Scarborough. All general\npractitioners and practice nurses in the 44 practices (a\ntotal of 245 staff) were eligible to participate.

The recruitment strategy was extended to\ninclude assistance from study personnel and mail\nshots. Towards the end of the recruitment period, a\nresearcher accessed the list of patients who had been\nrecruited in the early stages and invited them to attend\nfor collection of baseline data, so that all patients had\nbeen weighed within two months of randomisation. All\npractices were randomised simultaneously in June\n2000.\nRandomisation\nRaab and Butcher did the randomisation, using the\nmethod they described in 2001, in which patient level\ncharacteristics (body mass index at recruitment, age,\nand sex) and practice level characteristics (practice size,\nsocioeconomic status, and existence of dietetic service)\nwere used to inform randomisation.9 One permutation\nof treatment allocation with acceptable balance was\nrandomly selected, a method that ensured equal num-\nbers of practices and approximately equal numbers of\npatients in both treatment arms. Researchers collecting\nbaseline data contacted a distant member of the\nproject team to ascertain intervention status. We\narranged delivery of the intervention to practices as\nsoon as possible after completion of baseline data.\nEach intervention practice was allocated a control\npractice pair\u2014for purposes of data collection only\u2014to\nreduce any impact of seasonal variation in the main\noutcome variable.10\nIntervention\nAt the start of the intervention period, we provided all\npractices with a list of their patients who had entered the\ntrial. The educational strategy was based on a previous\nnutrition training programme.8 We delivered three 90\nminute sessions, intended to be delivered at intervals of\nno less than one week and no more than two weeks\napart, to the 22 intervention practices. We asked all gen-\neral practitioners and practice nurses to attend all three\nsessions. Four dietitians were trained in the standardised\ndelivery of the training and then delivered the\nprogramme to small group, multidisciplinary general\npractice teams. The programme promoted a model\napproach to obesity treatment, which incorporated best\nevidence and was perceived to be brief enough that pri-\nmary care staff could deliver it to their patients. The\ntraining covered information on the clinical benefit of\nweight loss and effective treatment options, including\nreduction of dietary energy intake, increased physical\nactivity, and pharmaceutical intervention.\nThe model of obesity management entailed practi-\ntioners seeing patients regularly (about every two\nweeks) until they had lost 10% of their original body\nweight and then less regularly (about every one to two\nmonths) for maintenance of weight over a sustained\nperiod. Current and target weight and dietary and\nactivity targets were to be recorded in the patients\u2019\nrecords to facilitate continuity of support across\npractice teams. Prescription of a moderate energy defi-\ncit diet was advocated, as recommended by the Scottish\nIntercollegiate Guidelines Network.11 A \u201cready reck-\noner\u201d was produced to allow practitioners to estimate a\npatient\u2019s daily energy requirement and then to\ncalculate a daily 500 kcal (2.5 MJ) deficit. Diet sheets\nand supporting written resources facilitated the dietary\nprescription to patients.

Control practices were asked to\nprovide usual care to their patients.\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was difference in mean\nweight of patients between intervention and control\npractices 12 months after the intervention. We also\nmeasured difference in weight at three months and 18\nmonths post-intervention. We measured knowledge of\nobesity management and self reported behaviour in\nobesity management consultations for all practice staff\nbefore and after the intervention. We gathered this\ninformation by using a questionnaire designed by us\nand field tested with staff from non-participating\npractices.\nProcess assessment\nPractices had no trial specific responsibility to see\npatients once the training intervention had been deliv-\nered. We used process assessment to provide insight\ninto the implementation of the weight management\nprotocol. Researchers extracted information from the\nmedical records of those patients still participating in\nthe trial, in both arms, one year after the intervention.\nThese data included whether patients had been seen\nabout their weight and whether weight, diet, and exer-\ncise targets had been recorded as advocated in the\nintervention.\nSample size and analysis\nA clinically significant effect of intervention can be\nachieved with as little as 5% (or 3-5 kg) weight loss in\nobese people.1 2 We designed the study to have 80%\npower to detect a mean difference in weight between\ntreatment arms of approximately 3-5 kg, assuming 5%\nsignificance and a within practice correlation coef-\nficient of 0.05. Allowing for withdrawal and loss to\nfollow up of 15%, this gave a required number of\npatients per treatment arm of approximately 660,\nequivalent to 22 practices recruiting 30 patients each.\nWe collated all data on a purposefully designed\ndatabase by using Microsoft Access software. We\nanalysed change in both continuous and categorical\noutcome variables by using STATA to account for both\nwithin cluster and between cluster variation. We did\nanalyses on an intention to treat basis, where possible.\nBlinding\nPatients were not aware of the intervention status of\ntheir practice, and researchers collecting outcome\nmeasurements from patients were blind to the\nintervention status of the practices, both before and\nafter the intervention. Double blinding was not\npossible in this trial, as practice staff were inevitably\naware of whether or not they had been trained.\nResults\nAll 44 practices completed the trial. One practice (allo-\ncated to the intervention group) declined the training\nintervention but agreed to continue with outcome\nassessment, and one would only consent to the training\nif two of the three sessions were combined. Training\nwas delivered between June and November 2000. This\nextended intervention period was due to difficulties in\narranging training sessions in practices.\nIn total, 991 patients gave consent, of whom 843\n(85%) attended for collection of baseline data and were\nsubsequently randomised. Table 1 shows the character-\nistics of the practices and patients after randomisation.\nTable 2 shows the difference in patients\u2019 weight after\nthe training. Twelve months after the training the\npatients in the intervention group were 1 (95%\nconfidence interval \u2212 1.9 to 3.9) kg heavier than the\ncontrols (P = 0.5).\nTwo hundred and thirty one (95%) practitioners\ncompleted the questionnaire at baseline, and 192\n(83%) of these completed the post-intervention assess-\nment. Table 3 shows the difference in knowledge levels\nbetween control and intervention practitioners after\nthe training. The odds ratio of providing the correct\nresponse was higher for trained practices for all but\none of the five questions, but only two of these reached\nstatistical significance.\nWe collected process information from the medical\nrecords of 670 patients. Table 4 shows the difference in\nactivities between intervention and control practices\none year after the training intervention.

Trained practices were\nmore likely to discuss weight (odds ratio 2.0, P = 0.003),\nand the records of patients from trained practices were\nmore likely to include weight (odds ratio 2.0,\nP = 0.004), target weight (13.6, P \u2264 0.001), and dietary\ntargets (4.5, P = 0.02).\nDiscussion\nThe rapid increase in the incidence of obesity and\nassociated comorbidities presents a major challenge to\nhealth care in the United Kingdom. The National\nAudit Office reported a lack of \u201cbuy in\u201d towards man-\nagement of obesity on the part of general practitioners,\nbut also that training, information on the effectiveness\nof interventions, and resources to use with patients\nwould assist them in the task.5 Our findings indicate\nthat a training package promoting a brief and\nprescriptive approach to the treatment of obesity by\nusing lifestyle modification, and intended to assist pri-\nmary care staff incorporating such treatment into rou-\ntine care, did not ultimately affect the weight of this\nmotivated and at risk cohort of patients.\nImpact of the intervention\nThe training was well received and was based on an\nacceptable model applied in a previous study.8\nPractitioners\u2019 knowledge of the principles of obesity\nmanagement improved, and trained practitioners were\nmore likely to implement weight management\nstrategies promoted in the training. Patients from\ntrained practices were seen more often and were more\nlikely to have weight, target weights, and dietary targets\ndocumented in their records, but in absolute terms the\nlevel of implementation was low. Target weights were\nrecorded for only 14% of participating patients in\ntrained practices, compared with just 3% of participat-\ning patients in control practices, in the year after deliv-\nery of the training. Patients in trained practices\nattended two more consultations than did those in\ncontrol practices, averaging eight consultations in the\nyear after the intervention. Treatment as per protocol\nwould entail fortnightly follow up until 10% of initial\nbody weight was lost, potentially some 20 or more con-\nsultations in the year. The low level of implementation\nof the obesity management model means that we\ncannot draw conclusions about its effectiveness.\nThe training programme was realistic in terms of\nthe type of training that might be delivered to primary\ncare teams by NHS dietitians. Obesity management is\ncomplex, and strategies that have shown promise in\nthe literature include the application of behaviour\nchange techniques, antiobesity drugs, and promotion\nof higher levels of physical activity. Undoubtedly, a four\nand a half hour training programme can only scratch\nthe surface of these issues. Even so, several general\npractitioners from these motivated practices expressed\nmisgivings about the need to devote so much time to\nthe subject, and indeed more in-depth training for\npractice teams is unlikely to be feasible, set against\ncompeting educational priorities in general practice.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the study\nSeveral previously recognised characteristics of obesity\ntreatment trials were evident in our study.12 Samples\nare usually biased towards women, and our sample was\npredominately female. In addition, our sample was\nskewed towards more extreme obesity. Retention of\nparticipants in obesity trials is recognised as problem-\natic,12 and it was potentially an even greater problem in\nour study, as the intervention was aimed at practices\nand it may have been difficult for patients to see any\nbenefit from participation. Despite the observed loss to\nfollow up of patients, the study maintained 80% power\nowing to a negligible within practice correlation\ncoefficient for the main outcome variable.\nUsing the general practice as the unit of\nrandomisation reduces the possibility of contamina-\ntion between treatment arms by minimising the risk of\ncontact between health professionals from different\narms. As stated earlier, in an effort to further eliminate\ncontamination, we offered training only to general\npractitioners and practice nurses. In reality, enforcing\nthis research condition was difficult, and many\nadditional practice staff, including district nurses and\nhealth visitors, turned up for the training. We detected\nno evidence of contamination between intervention\ngroups, but this cannot be ruled out.\nConclusion\nThis training programme resulted in only limited\nimplementation of an approach to obesity manage-\nment and did not achieve improved patient weight loss.\nA more in-depth training programme might be more\nsuccessful at changing practitioners\u2019 behaviour but is\nunlikely to be generalisable to most general practices\nin the United Kingdom. Other strategies to manage\nobesity in primary care urgently need to be considered\nand evaluated. These might include motivated and\ndedicated obesity specialists placed at the level of the\nprimary care trust, use of leisure services, and use of\nthe commercial weight loss sector.\nWe thank the dietetic managers, Chris Wyn-Jones (North\nDurham), Julia Smith (Newcastle Nutrition), Sue Waddington\n(Scarborough), and Celia Firmin (Leeds Community Dietetics)\nfor their contribution to the study design and help to ensure its\nsmooth running; Andy Vail (Hope Hospital, Salford) for his ini-\nTable 4 Difference in process outcomes between patients from intervention and control practices after training.
