The review considers the chemical cleaning mechanism,\nand the perceived link between this and membrane fouling by natural organic\nmatter (NOM)\u2014the principal foulant in municipal potable water applications.\nExisting chemical cleaning agents used for this duty are considered individually\nand their cleaning action described, along with the most commonly applied\ncleaning protocols (i.e. the cleaning conditions, cleaning sequence and method\nof cleaning agent application).

Introduction \nThere is considerably less literature dedicated to membrane cleaning than to fouling [1,2] \nparticularly regarding either theoretical development or municipal applications; this is \npossibly because membrane cleaning is considered a low-cost activity (compared to, for \nexample, pre-treatment). A review of the scientific and technical literature on Scopus reveals \nthat of the 1200-or-so papers on microfiltration or ultrafiltration identified when these terms \nare combined with those relating to drinking water supply (\u201cpotable\u201d, \u201cdrinking\u201d, \n\u201cfreshwater\u201d and \u201craw water\u201d), 279 included the subject of fouling with 80 of these including \nthe word \u201cfouling\u201d in the article title. Using the same terms and substituting the word \n\u201ccleaning\u201d for fouling the title search yielded only 9 results. Whilst this is far from \n*Manuscript\nPage 2 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2 \n \ncomprehensive, with many key papers (Table 1) left unidentified by such a \u201cblind\u201d search, \nthe outcomes are none-the-less indicative of the lack of attention paid to membrane chemical \ncleaning in the municipal sector when compared to fouling.  \n \nThe earliest particle fouling modelling studies were based on colloidal particle trajectory \nanalysis with Darcian relationships and Hagen-Poiseulle flow [3]. These models assumed \nhomogeneous fouling and pore size and distribution characteristics and did not relate well to \nfield observations. Fane and Fell [4] discussed the properties of ultrafiltration (UF) and \nmicrofiltration (MF) membranes and related these to flux decline behaviour, but the \ndiscussion of fouling control mechanisms was not oriented towards development of practical \noptions such as chemical cleaning. With uptake of potable membrane water treatment plants \nincreasing from the late 1990s, researchers began to relate permeation to the characteristics of \nnatural organic matter (NOM), a key component of most source waters, with many feed water \ncharacterisation studies aimed at identifying and understanding the behaviour of major NOM \nfoulants [5-7]. This work has extended through prediction of fouling [8,9] and amelioration \nthrough pretreatment [10], and membrane material surface modification [11]. \n \nEarly modelling investigations revealed inconsistencies between fouling from natural raw \nsource waters and that from model studies [12]. It has since become apparent that not only \nNOM but also extracellular polymeric substances, or EPS [13,14] are possible key foulants; \nthe complexity of organism behaviour and refouling tendencies makes cleaning science \ndevelopment critical to operation. With increasing numbers of membrane installations, and \ncommensurately more related studies providing more information, modelling based on \nfouling mechanisms has become more sophisticated, incorporating observed impacts of \nmembrane morphology on heterogeneity of the foulant deposition layers [15] and the \nmorphology of fouling itself [16]. Such models have mainly been based on laboratory work \nusing analogue foulants, dedicated to either a fundamental understanding of fouling and\/or \nthe development of fouling resistant membranes [17], or through mitigation of adsorption \nproperties of known problem foulants [18,19]. From the turn of the millennium there has \nbeen increased study of patterns of foulants with variability in cleaning and backwashing. \nCombinations of operational and material conditions, such as the impact of surface \nmodification of membrane materials [20], have been investigated aimed at predicting fouling \nbehaviour. \n \nPage 3 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3 \n \nAcross the entire range of UF and MF, studies of cleaning have been secondary to developing \nan understanding of fouling; cleaning studies themselves have been largely limited to \nphysical cleaning (i.e. backflushing, or reversing the flow back through the membrane, and \nrelaxation, or temporary cessation of permeate flow). Notwithstanding the greatly improved \nunderstanding of fouling, there remains a challenge both to develop the techniques and \nregimes for their effective and efficient removal; the same level of understanding for cleaning \nas exists for fouling needs to be attained. \n \n2. Membrane chemical cleaning  \n2.1. Definition \nThe simplest definition of cleaning is a procedure applied to a material to relieve it of all non \nintegral substances which are generally termed \u201cfoulants\u201d [21]. Fouling is thus the general \nterm for the decline in flux, or more accurately permeability, with time. The foulants may be \nreversible or irreversible, the latter causing permanent changes in the membrane performance \n[22], and cleaning thus aims to remove all foulants either by physical, chemical or \nbiochemical means [23]. \n2.2. Mechanism \nMembrane chemical cleaning can be envisaged as a 6-step process [24,25]: \n1. bulk reaction (hydrolysis and other) of cleaning reagents as the CIP is introduced, \n2. cleaning agent is transported to membrane surface, \n3. cleaning agent transits through foulant layers to membrane surface, \n4. cleaning reactions solubilise and detach foulants, \n5. waste cleaning agent with suspended foulants transported to interface, and finally \n6. transport of waste matter to the bulk solution from retentate side of membrane.  \n \nA de facto accepted conceptual model for cleaning and fouling was presented by Liu et al. \n[26], which links the major fouling and cleaning forces. The foulant and membrane interact \nmainly through hydrophobic attraction; the mechanism for cleaning is primarily electrostatic \nrepulsion. An understanding of the foulant chemical properties expedites the selection of \ncleaning chemicals, since chemical effects are largely understood: fouling by potable waters \nis increased at higher foulant molecular weights and charge ratios, the presence of divalent \ncations in the water and membrane hydrophobicity [16,26]. An increase in the cleaning \nPage 4 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4 \n \nmedium electrostatic potential through charge density, polarity or pH thus suppresses the \nattraction forces and increases cleaning efficacy. \n2.3. Plant operation and design. \nCleaning is applied routinely via a chemically enhanced backflush (CEB) or a clean in place \n(CIP). A chemical reagent is introduced into the permeate side of the membrane; the lumens \nfor in-out capillary tube (CT) or the module shell for out-in hollow fibre (HF) membranes. \nFor a CEB, the chemicals are introduced with the routine backflush. CEB is used for \nstabilising\/maintaining the permeability (and is often referred to as \u201cmaintenance\u201d cleaning) \nby preventing foulant build up, and is automatically scheduled daily to weekly with no \nmanual intervention. The CEB reagent concentration is relatively low, soak times relatively \nshort and application temperatures normally ambient, compared to a CIP where the objective \nis to recover the flux and thus requiring longer soak times and higher cleaning agent \nconcentrations and soak temperatures. CIPs are normally applied on an ad-hoc basis in \nresponse to excessive permeability decline, and can involve a sequence of cleans using \ndifferent reagents (normally basic, oxidative and acidic). \n \nStudies of cleaning efficacy across 21 existing full-scale potable water MF\/UF plants [27,28] \nrevealed differing sustainable fluxes according to the level of pretreatment, backflush cycle \ntime, chemical cleaning cycle time, cleaning temperature and, in particular, design flux. It is \nnow generally recognised that the capital cost advantage offered by higher-flux operation is \nmore than offset by the greater diligence demanded with cleaning, the reduced cleaning cycle \ntime, and performance and life of the membrane [29]. In a more recent and extensive survey \nof 87 plants [30], very diverse cleaning practices were revealed. Backflush frequencies varied \nfrom 5 to 96 per day with a median of 32 and lasted from 10 seconds to 10 minutes with a \nmedian of 77 seconds. Less than half the plants surveyed carried out maintenance cleaning on \naverage more than once a week. The CIP cleaning frequency ranged from 0.2 to 50 per year \nwith a median of 4 per year. Results were skewed by the under sizing of some plants, \nconfirming findings of water industry wide research [2] regarding flux sustainability. \n2.4. Cleaning reagent performance. \nThe primary barrier to effective chemical cleaning is thought to be mass transfer, the second \nstep in the cleaning mechanism (Section 2.2.), where the chemical is prevented from reaching \nthe foulant at high enough concentrations to overcome the attraction forces [26].  Figure 1 \nshows this electrostatic model schematically. Since, in the electrostatic equilibrium model, \nPage 5 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5 \n \nforces retaining the foulant at the membrane are reduced during cleaning to allow its physical \nremoval, it follows that the most appropriate cleaning agent will depend upon the nature of \nthe foulant, i.e. organic\/inorganic, acidic\/basic, and the charge state. It is possible to envisage \nthe transport mechanisms using a simple stage model shown in Figure 2.  The accepted \nphysico-chemical mechanisms attributable to the most commonly available potable \nmembrane cleaning agents are summarised in Table 2. \n \n2.4.1. Caustic soda \nCaustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions are applied mainly at pH levels of 11-12, \nor less if membrane chemical resistance is an issue (as is the case with polyvinylidene \ndifluoride, or PVDF). Hydroxide encourages dissolution of weakly acidic organic matter, \ngenerally with carboxylic and phenolic functional groups, and promotes cleavage of \npolysaccharides and proteins into smaller sugars and amides [31,32,33]. Hydroxide also \nexpands NOM molecules, allowing enhanced mass transfer of the cleaning agent solution to \nthe membrane surface [34]. It may also be effective for removing inorganic colloids and \nsilicates where charge effects and ionic strength increase the solubility and electrostatic \nrepulsion [35]. Permeability recovery tends to increase with NaOH concentration up to a \nthreshold value which varies for different foulants and membrane materials [26,33,35,36], \napplication [37] and the degree of fouling [22]. \n \n2.4.2. Oxidants \nOxidants include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), of which the \nlatter is by far the most common. However hypochlorite is not universally applied since (a) \nsome polypropylene (PP) membranes are not chlorine tolerant [23], and (b) chlorinated \norganics are generated which can have health and environmental impacts which then may \nrestrict the use of chlorine based reagents. Oxidation degrades the NOM functional groups to \ncarboxyl, ketonic and aldehyde groups, which makes them more susceptible to hydrolysis at \nhigh pH levels [38]. This may explain why the combination of oxidant with alkaline cleaning \nagents has been shown empirically to be more effective than oxidant cleaning agents alone, \nespecially where organic foulants dominate [34,39-41].  \n \nIn a comparison study between alkaline H2O2 and NaOCl cleaning of NOM-fouled PES UF \nmembranes, NaOCl was found to provide better removal of organics through oxidation of \nPage 6 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6 \n \naromatic humic substances at elevated pH levels [39]. This was not repeated for peroxide. \nThe halogenation of the aromatic rings is known to be a common mechanism for the \nbreakdown of humic materials [42], furthermore, the Strugholtz study [39] appears to suggest \nthat the oxidative properties of the hypochlorite may be more significant than the hydrolysis \ncatalysing effect of the hydroxide. Liu et al.\u2019s study (2001) [26] indicates that caustic \npromotes a more open fouling layer that allows the chlorine to reach the membrane surface, \nwhich may explain the increased efficacy of hypochlorite at higher pH levels. Huang et al., \n(2008) [43] showed that free chlorine affects oxidation of organic colloids while the soak \ntime governs their diffusion from the membrane surface. Chlorine is thought to contribute to \nmembrane swelling, which generally enhances mass transfer of the cleaning agent to the \nfoulant at the membrane surface [22]. \n \nClearly, it is advantageous to establish the optimum concentration of caustic soda and \nhypochlorite for membrane cleaning, since excessive concentrations of hypochlorite are \nundesirable on the basis of cost and loss of membrane integrity. At concentrations above 150 \nmg.L\n-1\n and low-neutral pH levels, chlorination of the C-S bonds in PES has been observed \n[44], and the alkaline tolerance of PVDF membranes is limited to pH levels below 11. \nHowever, the variation in permeability recovery from these studies indicates that cleaning \nefficiency cannot be estimated solely on the basis of the chemistry of the foulant, cleaning \nagent and the membrane material - a conclusion arrived at from a recent survey of plants in \nthe UK [45]. \n \n2.4.3. Acids \nAcid cleaning aims to remove multivalent cationic species such as in hardness salts and metal \nhydroxides [21,22]. Mineral acids, predominantly hydrochloric (HCl) and sulphuric (H2SO4), \nare commonly used, due to their low cost, and are effective for both CEB and CIP down to \npH levels of 1.0 for PES and PVDF, below which integrity problems may arise. As well as \ncatalysing acid hydrolysis, acids are mildly oxidative for NOM, forming soluble aromatic \naldehydes and acids at NOM functional groups [38], but are generally used for removal of \nmineral scaling. \n \nWhilst strong mineral acids can solubilise deposits, organic acids, such as citric and oxalic, \nare more effective for formation and transportation of organo-metallic foulants from the \nPage 7 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7 \n \nmembrane to the bulk solution [39]. Citric acid provides buffering and has good chelating \nabilities, making it effective and easy to use with a lower risk of pH damage compared with \nmineral acids [29]. Along with NaOCl, it is reported to be the most used chemical cleaner for \nMF\/UF membranes [30]. Citric acid can disrupt biofilm formation by removing minerals \nfrom foulant layers [46], disrupting enzymes that allow their establishment [47,48]. Iron \nreadily forms complexes [23] but their limited solubility inhibits their transport from the \nmembrane surface [22]. The combination of citric and oxalic acid has proved effective in \npractice where multiple organometallic complex species can form [49], supporting \nobservations from cleaning effectiveness studies where combinations of cleaning agents in \nmulti stage applications proved more effective and high permeability recovery more \nattainable despite incomplete foulant removal [48].  \n \nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is another chelating ligand providing reasonable removal of \ninorganic scale but, in common with most chelates, has poor removal of elemental sulphur \nand colloidal silicates [47]. As with citric acid, its buffering capability and sequestering \nability make it potentially useful for routine automated cleaning or even CEB where the risk \nof overdose and damage are lessened. Its use has been reported in very few MF\/UF cleaning \npapers; it is recommended only for some proprietary industrial membranes [21] and, most \nusually, for cellulose acetate RO membranes fouled with metal oxides [33]. It is apparently \nless effective than other cleaning chemicals against NOM [41]. \n \n2.4.4. Others \nCleaning additives such as EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) provide additional \nchelation capacity for metals such as calcium and the dispersal minerals in general [22,26,41] \nEDTA is often blended into proprietary cleaning agents as an enzyme disruptor (such as P3 \nUltrasil 11) and studies have demonstrated they inhibit biofilm reformation [25]. Enzyme \ncleaning agents have been applied on some PP membrane-based US plants where they are \nshown  to function at temperatures up to 45\u00b0C [27]. However, its general use in potable water \nis constrained both by cost and potable water legislation. \n \nAmmonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) has also been used to assist the removal of silica deposits \n[29], though silica remains one of the most challenging of foulants since it forms inert silicate \ncolloids with high surface attraction forces. Silica is highly insoluble and does not readily \nPage 8 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8 \n \nhydrolyse [50]. It is destabilised only by fluoride, which can displace the counter ion but may \nalso cause damage to some membranes. Ammonium bifluoride is occasionally dosed to break \nup silica deposits [29]. It is favourable to remove silica through pretreatment [31]. \n \n3. Cleaning processes \n3.1. Effect of cleaning agent sequence \nCleaning sequence application is known to affect the degree of permeability recovery [22]. \nStudies where membrane cleaning sequences have been tested consistently indicate that an \nalkali followed by an acid clean is more effective than the reverse for membranes treating \nsurface water [21,26,33-37,43,51]. This could be explained by the effect of the charge on the \nmembrane surface and foulants (associated with the cleaving of the foulant molecules) \nfollowing the alkaline clean, along with swelling of both the foulant layer and the membrane \nat higher pHs. This then enhances the cleaning reagent mass transfer for the subsequent step. \nHowever, an acid-alkali cleaning sequence is commonly specified for groundwater sources, \nsince the acid removes inorganics such as metal oxides and carbonates which may otherwise \nform precipitates at high pH [29]. A reduced temperature sensitivity has been reported for \nremoval hydrophobic NOM, with the acid-alkali sequence [39]. Industrial process waters \ntreating proteinaceous waters routinely employ an acid-alkali sequence to prevent gel layer \nformation [2] or mineral precipitation [21]. \n \nThe choice of cleaning sequence is governed by the feed water and the type of fouling. From \nthe literature it appears that a predominance of hydrophobic NOM favours alkali followed by \nacid, whilst predominantly inorganic scaling or metal hydroxide precipitates favour acid-\nalkali. Given that both these materials are present in biofilms in varying proportions, and that \nbiofouling can be considered ubiquitous in potable water membrane plants, selection of the \nmost appropriate cleaning sequence is not always apparent on the initial process technology \nand system selection. \n3.2. Other cleaning factors \nIncreased temperatures decrease the reliance on turbulence to overcome mass transfer \nlimitations, since diffusive mass transfer is increased, and this is seen as an important \nqualitative cleaning model factor [36]. Foulant solubility is also increased at higher \ntemperatures, as is reactivity of the NOM functional groups [42], and also swelling and \nPage 9 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9 \n \nmechanical destabilisation of organic foulant or biofilm layers [52]. However extremes of \ntemperature and pH can also solidify and crystallise biofilm deposits, and specifically the \nscalant components of these (calcium carbonate, ferric hydroxide, silicates, etc), making them \nharder to remove [36]. Membrane integrity also limits the range of pH and temperature, \nalthough the latter is determined by the potting material used in the membrane modules rather \nthan the membrane material itself.  \n3.3. Alternative processes \nMore benign but expensive alternative cleaners, such as enzymes, are employed more usually \nfor industrial and food waste treatment [18] where added value is higher than for municipal \napplications: enzymic cleaning is not considered appropriate to bulk potable applications. \nUltrasonic cleaning has been used for treating flat sheet membranes in laboratory tests [53] \nand for membranes fouled from dairy processing operations [54], though this treatment can \ncause membrane damage and incurs a high energy demand [55]. In this regard there is \nevidence that some membranes are more susceptible to integrity failure than others: PES \nmaterials were shown to fail after 5 minutes of exposure to the ultrasound (at f = 47 kHz). \nHowever, more recent studies demonstrated some potential for ultrasonic cleaning in lower \nflux crossflow systems fouled with dairy wastewater [54].  There is evidently further research \nneeded to establish whether ultrasonically-assisted cleaning has a place in potable water \nmembrane filtration where integrity is critical. \n3.4. Cleaning process studies \nGiven the stated variables influencing cleaning efficacy it is clear that rigorous assessment of \ncleaning efficacy is challenging, given the heterogeneous and sometimes quixotic nature of \nfouling. Comprehensive modelling of membrane cleaning demands a large number of \nexperiments to cover possible ranges of membrane fouling conditions from natural waters. \nAn early attempt by Bartlett et al. to quantify cleaning [36] studied the permeability recovery \nresponse to cleaning factors for flat sheet membranes fouled with dairy waste. This study \nexamined concentration, temperature, alkali\/acid combinations and cross flow effects on \ndifferent surface concentrations of the same foulant, and concluded that the optimum \ncleaning response could be reached using different regimes.  \n \nChen et al. [56] carried out the first reported factorial study experiment on a suite of \nmembrane operating parameters, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on their operational \nimpact. The experiments employed HCl and NaOH to clean spiral wound RO and UF fouled \nPage 10 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10 \n \nwith municipal wastewater secondary effluent. Factors considered were NaOH concentration, \ntemperature and recirculation duration, HCl cleaning time and the use of forward backflush \nand normal backwash after chemical cleaning. The relationships between the resulting \nrecoveries were explored. For this application it was seen that the temperature and \nconcentration of the NaOH were most critical in optimising recovery in combination with the \napplication of a backflush. \n \nThis factorising of chemical cleaning variables has been advanced in the research [45, 46, 52, \n57] and there also exists possibilities for automating and optimising the cleaning and \nbackwash cycles, as demonstrated for UF plants [58]. The need for controlling cleaning has \nled to the proposal of dynamic models for predicting optimum soak times [59]. These models \nhave been developed for given specified conditions and mainstream cleaning research \nremains generally restricted to specific treatment problems using empirical and heuristic data \n[51]. These should not be conflated with recently suggested generic fouling models [60]. \nRecent factorial studies of a number of membranes show that simple optimisation based on \nmultiple factors varies between and within the different types and configurations [45] and this \nsuggests cleaning performance optimisation demands an ongoing systems approach. \n \nThe poor predictability of full scale systems in practice has led researchers to study neural \nnetworks, such as for predicting flux decline in MF\/UF systems [61,62]. This approach has \nbeen developed further by Strugholtz et al. (2008) [63], where ceramic UF systems were \noptimised using neural networks incorporating genetic succession algorithms based on the \ninitial operational and raw water parameter states.  \n4. Discussion and conclusions \nFoulant studies, particularly NOM fouling, have dominated research into cleaning but are \nbest described as \u201ca single frame of a moving picture\u201d [38]. It is clear that membrane material \nchoice affects the cleaning agent systems performance but these are prescribed by suppliers \nfrom limited information and can therefore serve to limit the scope for ongoing optimisation.  \nCleaning studies which have evolved from simple mass transport models, based on \nattachment\/detachment force equilibrium models and where the cleaning factors have \nfollowed foulant characterisation, have the potential to inform cleaning practice. A variety of \ntools are becoming more available for characterising systems and the empirical\/heuristic \nPage 11 of 19\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11 \n \napproach has led to differing interpretations of the relationship between fouling and MF\/UF \nplant design and operation. It has therefore been proposed that unified fouling index (UFI) be \ndeveloped [60]. A UFI would create indices based on quantification of the fouling potential \nof commercial membranes by standardised bench tests, and offers advantage(s) of being \nuniversally applicable to low pressure (i.e. ultrafiltration and microfiltration) membrane \nsystems for generic potable water types. \n \nPermeability recovery alone is itself insufficient to characterise changes in membrane fouling \nin response to cleaning [64]. The development of dynamic cleaning models provides a \nsystems approach to cleaning, whereby input variations, surface modification and ageing \neffects can be accommodated. A quantitative understanding of how the cleaning efficacy \nchanges under different loading and fouling conditions is also required. Advanced use of \nstatistical methods, such as response surface models [65], can be used to generate \npolynomials based on the key cleaning design parameters (cleaning agent concentration and \ntemperature, CEB backflush rate, cleaning exposure time, etc.), and have been recently \nemployed to optimise membrane cleaning [1, 46]. Whilst the coefficients generated by this \nmethod appear to be site specific [45], they may provide a basis for developing a unified \ncleaning index (UCI) from pilot or continuing bench scale tests alongside the UFI currently \nbeing proposed. With amalgamation of such bench tests and real time plant data, heuristic \nmodels would be possible that would expand the development of a practical membrane \ncleaning science. Given that UFI is currently in its infancy, it would seem that there is a \nconsiderably more development required in generating a usable UCI for informing chemical \ncleaning protocols. \nReferences \n[1] Porcelli., N. and Judd, S.J.
