Based on an ongoing action research study involving postgraduate\nstudents studying in the UK and USA, this paper will identify some theoretical roots and\nderive from these six conceptual areas that seem to the authors to have relevance and\nsignificance for behaviour online. An exploration of these forms the basis for a two-\ndimensional model which can account for what happens when groups come together to\nlearn in cyberspace. In depicting this model, there is acknowledgement of the existence of\nthird and fourth dimensions at work. However, the explanatory power of taking these\nextra dimensions into account is beyond the scope of the analysis thus far.\nIntroduction\nCurrent interest in the use of Communications and Information Technology (C&IT) in\nhigher education and other settings is at a high level (for example, Framework V: Towards\na User-Friendly Information Society; the ESRC Programme PACCIT) and while\nuniversities - in response to the Dearing Report - begin to exercise effort in restructuring\ncourse delivery methods to take advantage of the technology, there is a danger that the\nissue of the changes in the social dynamics that are a direct consequence of the transition\nfrom actual space to virtual space will be overlooked. Some work has been undertaken in\nthis area (notably Rheingold, 1991; Cook, 1995; McConnell, Hardy and Hodgson, 1996)\nbut there is need for additional research if we are to identify a clearer sense of how effective\nonline learning might manifest itself. We agree with Jones (1998), however, that the\ntechnology presents considerable challenges in establishing and maintaining communities:\n64\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nThe learning process may bring people together insofar as such learning is often\ncollaborative, but it is equally as often frustrating and off-putting. (Jones, 1998: 8)\nThis paper will explore an approach to postgraduate education which depends on online\ncollaborative construction of knowledge, drawing on students' past experience and new\nunderstanding gained on the course. There are other models of practice employing\ncomputer-mediated communication (CMC) in postgraduate teaching, but it has been\ndecided to limit the scope of this paper to action science groups (Argyris, Putnam and\nSmith, 1986) because the nature of the work undertaken by these small groups is intense\nand personal, providing fertile ground for the creation of the learning community which is\nthe focus of the research. Action Science has been described as 'the science of\ninterpersonal action' (Argyris, 1993) and is an approach to personal and organizational\ndevelopment. Action science employs a number of methods by which participants examine\ntheir work-based defensive routines and look to change their underlying theories-in-use to\nproduce more positive and effective ones. Participants of all six cohorts under\nconsideration here wrote case studies which were then interrogated online by their small\ngroup and the two facilitators. A case study in this context is a written record of a\nremembered conversation about which the case writer feels dissatisfied for some reason. It\nwas expected that learning will occur at two levels. Firstly, each case writer has the\nopportunity to gain insight into his or her own defensive routines as played out in the\noriginal dialogue. Secondly, all group members learn the specific questioning skills\nrequired of an action scientist, enhance their ability to spot underlying inconsistencies in a\nconversation and gain practice in rewriting statements in a new format which is more likely\nto lead to mutual learning and win-win outcomes.\nIt is felt that each group within the six cohorts that represents our data set has\ndemonstrated some vivid characteristics. We consider that this rich environment is a source\nof real insights into the challenges offered by CMC in creating learning communities and\nthis has enabled us to develop a model that goes some way to describing the characteristics\nof these communities.\nThere have been almost fifty years of research and theorizing about the way in which\ngroups of various sizes function in a variety of face-to-face settings, including some in\nhigher education classrooms and lecture theatres. Research into CMC has a much shorter\nhistory. An examination of the literature persuades us that it is easy to make incorrect\nassumptions about the characteristics of the online classroom. CMC is often seen simply\nas another process which can be incorporated into existing thinking and practice, rather\nthan one requiring a shift in conceptualization: about teaching and learning; about groups;\nand about the effect of technology on their structure and function. As Fernback noted,\nWe know already that many of the assumptions we hold about the negotiation and\nformation of social relationships, and particularly about community, do not seem to\napply in the complex realm of CMC. (Fernback, 1999: 205)\nNot surprisingly, the rhetoric and some of the practice of teaching and learning see CMC\nas a potential pedagogy for higher education as the capacity of the medium to deliver\ncourse materials and to generate interactivity between lecturers and students and among\nthe student body becomes apparent. While the move towards the virtual campus cannot be\nignored, there is the need to identify some of its characteristics and the theories underlying\n65\nMike Davis and Kate Denning Almost as helpful as good theory: some conceptual possibilities for the online classroom\nthe practice. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to explore some of the theory that\ncontributes towards an effective understanding of what takes place when groups of\nstudents meet and learn online. In common with standard practice, students' names have\nbeen changed. Their contributions to discussion, however, are uncorrected.\nSome theoretical possibilities\nWhile not believing that activity in cyberspace has direct analogies with face-to-face\nexperiences, our thinking is shaped by attention to two main theoretical sources: group\ndynamics - both from a sociological (Miller, 1993) and a psychoanalytical perspective\n(Bion, 1961) - and situated learning, particularly its focus on notions of communities of\npractice, socially constructed knowledge and authentic activity (McLellan, 1996). In the\nlimited space we have available for this paper, we will go no further than claiming a\nrelationship between the components of situated learning identified by McLellan, onto\nwhich we have mapped online experience of working with action science.\nKey component Online experience of action science\nStories The case studies\nReflection Reflecting on and in action through case study interrogation and rewrites\nCognitive apprenticeship Working with 'expert' facilitators\nCollaboration Working collaboratively to reveal defensive routines and to seek win-win\nalternatives\nCoaching Deliberate teaching and modelling of good action science interrogation\nMultiple practice Successive cases during which time participants become more skilled and\nconfident\nArticulation of learning skills The construction of a metadialogue to inform a group's practice and\nachievement\nTechnology Making appropriate use of the available technology.\nTable I: Relationship between key components of situated learning and online experiences of action\nscience\nOur thinking, dominated at the time by consideration of group dynamics, led us to reflect\non six conceptual areas which seem to be powerful ingredients in the online classroom:\n\u2022 social organization\n\u2022 orientation towards learning\n\u2022 orientation towards task and\/or tutor\n\u2022 group work modality\n\u2022 emotional climate\n\u2022 group response to challenge.\n66\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nSocial organization\nWhile communication online can be task-based there is an expectation that other, non-task\nbut socially essential communication will contribute to the growth and sustenance of the\ncommunity. Sociolinguists call this phatic communication (Stubbs, 1983), and it is seen as\nessential to maintain effective social interaction. It has been argued (Feenberg, 1989) that\nCMC is poor at fulfilling these phatic functions. He writes: 'AH such phatic signs are\nbypassed in computer conferencing. Even standard codes for opening and closing\nconversations are discarded' (Feenberg, 1989: 22).\nThis is particularly problematic in online communication because there is only the single,\ntextual cue available for inspection in contrast with the multiple cues that exist in face-to-\nface communication. Evidence from previous studies in CMC (Davis, 1997; Davis and\nHolt, 1998) suggests that this form of interchange may not arise spontaneously and its\nabsence can contribute towards social isolation and withdrawal. There are models that\nsuggest that remediation of this is possible using a number of straightforward strategies,\nsuch as sending private email messages, directing comments at individuals and modelling\nresponsiveness (Harasim, Hiltz, Teles and Turoff, 1995; Midoro, 1999). The research is key\nboth to identify and to refine appropriate facilitation strategies to maximize effective\nlearner participation and interdependence. Positive outcomes of well-timed and well-\ncrafted tutor interventions include independence and community. However, whilst\nindependence can be a rewarding outcome of a learning experience, it can also work\nagainst effective community membership.\nOrientation towards learning\nOrientation towards learning has two related continua:\nindividual >- cooperative >- collaborative\ndependent >- independent >- interdependent\nCollaborative, interdependent learning, which is that discovered in a learning community,\ncan be understood 'as a distributed, ongoing social process, where evidence that learning is\noccurring or has occurred must be found in understanding the ways in which people\ncollaboratively do learning and do recognize learning as having occurred' (Jordan, 1996:\n42). Collaborative learning occurs when participants mutually engage 'in a coordinated\neffort to solve [a] problem together' (Roschelle and Behrend, 1995: 70). Whipple describes\nthe benefits of collaborative learning:\ncollaboration results in a level of knowledge within the group that is greater than the\nsum of the knowledge of the individual participants. Collaborative activities lead to\nemergent knowledge, which is the result of interaction between (not summation of) the\nunderstandings of those who contribute to its formation. (Whipple, 1987: 5).\nIn contrast, Hiltz, describing the software they use, writes: \"This assignment was carried\nout using the 'activity branch' software. In a response branch, each student must answer\nthe question before being able to read the answer of others' (Hiltz, 1994: 59).\nThis kind of structure may work counter to attempts at building a learning community.\nWhilst the focus is on ensuring that the individual learner thinks, then an interactive\n67\nMike Davis and Kate Denning Almost as helpful as good theory: some conceptual possibilities for the online classroom\nbuilding of ideas is absent and it becomes unlikely that collaborative learning can take\nplace or a learning community emerge.\nOrientation towards task\/tutor\nA classic depiction (Bennis and Shepard, 1956) of group life is that it can be divided into\ntwo main phases: dependence-power relations and interdependence-personal relations, and it\nis this that determines the orientation towards the task and the tutor. In dependence-power\nrelations, students engage in flight from the task through avoidance and reliance on social\nengagement to occupy time. Counterdependency - a metaphorical fight with authority -\ncan also emerge. The shift into interdependence-personal relations leads to conditions where\nthere is considerably less dependence on external authority - either in the shape of the task\nor the tutor - and the development of a shared sense of responsibility for group\nperformance. In online communities, this can create conditions in which members feel\naddicted to the process. In sharp contrast to this condition is the total separation of self\nfrom others: the condition of anomie 'when members of a superficially well-organised\nsociety feel disconnected and isolated' (Reber, 1995: 39).\nGroup work modality\nGroup life can also be characterized from a more psychological perspective, originally\nmodelled by WDfred Bion (Bion, 1961). Fundamental to Bion's thinking about groups is\nthat membership of them is part of the human condition. As he wrote: 'no individual,\nhowever isolated in time and space, can be regarded as outside a group, or lacking in active\nmanifestations of group psychology' (Bion, 1961:132).\nBion proposed that groups work at two levels. Work groups function effectively, engage\nwith the task and with one another and attend to the needs of the group. According to\nBion, however, whilst a group is operating in 'work' mode it is also capable of being\nsubverted at any one time by one of the three basic assumptions - dependence, flight\/fight\nor pairing.\nA group moves into basic assumption dependency whenever it is reliant on a leader and\nbelieves that the leader will control, make decisions and rein in any passions that are too\nthreatening to the safety of the group. A group in conflict or under pressure will often\nmove into denial manifest as flight (running away from a difficult issue to talk about 'safer'\ntopics) or fight (usually a verbal struggle). A group is considered to be in basic assumption\npairing when two members of the group are heavily involved in a discussion and the\nremainder of the group is silent but attentive. It is likely that a series of pairs will emerge,\neach dominating the discussion for a while. Basic assumption groups are thought to be\nmutually exclusive: for example, a group in basic assumption pairing cannot demonstrate\nflight\/fight or dependency-type behaviour. It is possible for a group to move readily from\none basic assumption to another.\nEmotional climate\nAll of the above conditions represent a challenge to the group and this challenge\ncontributes towards an emotional reaction, either shared or individual. Among these, we\nhave identified indifference (real or otherwise), frustration, off-task fascination, and\n68\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nanxiety. The first three are counterproductive in respect of the success of the group and\/or\nits task completion. The latter can be productive or its opposite: too high anxiety\ninvariably leads to ineffectiveness or, in the worst case, withdrawal; too low is insufficient to\ndrive the motor of learning.\nGroup response to challenge\nGroups respond to challenge at different times in different ways. Our experience has led us\nto identify four responses: groups that become hostile to the task reveal passive resistance\nor aggression, often by showing little interest in the activity; others deny that there is a\nproblem when attempts are made to establish dialogue about the events unfolding. Others\nbecome fascinated with membership of the group and are seduced by the social aspects of\ntheir communication. Successful groups, however, engage in risk-taking: challenging other\nmembers, indeed challenging themselves, to push the margins of what is possible.\nDiscussion\nIn an attempt to gain some insight into how these conceptual areas might inter-relate, we\nchose a 2 x 2 matrix (see Figure 1) to characterize four archetypal groups.\nHigh (9)\nLearning\nDynamics\nLow(l)\nType 9.1-\"I'm ok,\nyou're ok!\"\n1.

Socially, group members are isolated and their basic\nassumption is flight - from the task and any discussion about the task. This leads to public\nMike Davis and Kate Denning Almost as helpful as good theory some conceptual possibilities for the online classroom\nindifference (despite email messages that indicate private frustration and anger) and a\ngroup strategy of passive resistance or aggression. Whilst successful groups showed\nthemselves willing to build upon each other's ideas and create new levels of understanding,\nother groups never gained any momentum:\nHilary: I am not really enjoying our group interaction. It is very slow and uninvolved\nand the communication levels are very low. I am finding it hard to find questions to ask.\nI don't know why.\nA willingness to avoid the task and discussion about the task is well summed up by one\ncase-writer who commented on his own case as follows:\nJack: i [sic] have reviewed your input, and appreciated your interest, the questions that\nwere asked will help me focus on the situation.\nSince this particular casewriter only made two interventions into his own case (the average\nfor one of the cohorts was twenty-six) this represents 50 per cent of his output and clearly\nthe experience has made little positive impact on him and the rest of the group.\nSummer Holiday (1.9)\nIf a group is high on group dynamics but low on learning dynamics then group members\nmay be having a lot of fun whilst achieving little learning. Here, members are displaced\nfrom normal life and they demonstrate self-interest and individuality. Work is avoided and\nthe complex notion of basic assumption pairing is acted out. In this, the group waits for a\nmagical event to emerge from possible pairing of other participants. Accordingly, they can\nbe high on social interaction - invariably manifested through social 'conversation' at the\nexpense of work. Indeed, the social is the dominant theme in this type of group and this, of\ncourse, can be very satisfying for the members and is very seductive. The following example\ndemonstrates a group being hampered by notions of the need to be inclusive whilst at the\nsame time struggling with the process of making decisions online.\nLaura: since nobody is taking the initiative but everybody seems to share the view (at least\nthis is what I make out of it) I would like to see how many of you could make it for an on\nline session, real time sometime this satarday [sic] or Sunday afternoon. This is the time that\nI can make it if you think that some other time is more convinient [sic] please suggest it.\nThis comment came in week four of seven weeks when the group had already been\ndiscussing meeting synchronously (at the same time as each other) since the first week. It\nseems likely that the social element was so important for this group that the thought of\nmeeting up at a time that didn't suit all of them was unthinkable. The group continued to\nresist moves by various members to experiment with synchronous communication until, in\nweek six, the following intervention from one of the tutors coincided with the most\ninnovative member being more proactive about her desires.\nJack: Would 7pm on tonight and on Wednesday night suit everyone?\nKate (Facilitator): I think trying to get everyone may be a mistake. All you need is the\ncasewriter and one or two others. More is obviously great, but not essential. I sense\nwaiting for everyone to agree could mean that yet again you fail to meet.\n70\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nJack: that's true, Kate . . . I had forgotten that that time would not be convenient for all\n. . . so who will meet me on line . . . I'll be here at 7.00pm.\nAnd she was. Those that met up with her clearly enjoyed 'being' together, but continued to\nuse the time in a largely social way. Although the group had managed to overcome one of\nits difficulties (making decisions) it was unable to work against the by now well established\nnorm of social activity dominating the work space.\nI'm ok, you're ok (9.1)\nIf a group is high on learning dynamics but low on group dynamics then members will\nshow little concern for each other personally and will tend to work independently rather\nthan interdependently. One group whose group strategy we have characterized as denial\nhad the following conversation:\nMegan: I am aware that there are a number of things I have been thinking but not saying\nand I wonder if this is true for others also.\nRod: M, I too feel that perhaps we aren't as active as we could be. But I am OK with it.\nHere Rod refused to take up the gauntlet, preferring to work in her own way which Megan\nlater described as 'bullying'.\nSuch groups are capable of acting co-operatively rather than collaboratively. In the latter,\nunderstanding and insight grow from the social construction of knowledge. In the former, it is\nmore competitive and individual understanding and insight is the desired outcome, possibly at\nthe expense of others' learning. Inevitably, groups who find themselves in this situation\ndemonstrate counter-dependent behaviour with frequent (although invariably unsuccessful)\nappeals to authority to deal with the problematic group dynamics. Equally inevitably, tutors are\nheld responsible for their failure to make the groups work more effectively and members deny\ntheir collective and individual responsibilities for the difficulties the group is experiencing.\nBelow is an extract from a group who struggled and looked to the tutors to make the\ninteraction more productive.\nSue: MikeD, Kate, correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that in order for a case to be\ncompleted, it was necessary to provide the 'interrogated' with a TIU. This didn't happen\nin my case.\nKelly: yes, S. I am also interested in getting an answer to this question, you will\nremember that I raised a similar concern to Kate and MikeD last time when my case was\ndiscussed, but I did not get any satisfactory response. As for MikeD, he did not even\nbother to comment on the issue. With Kate it was better because, even if she did not\nanswer my question, she at least asked me questions in relation to the issue.\nHere we have two group members whose primary concern is that they gain from the\nexperience without necessarily giving to the rest of the group. Both are requesting a theory-\nin-use from members of the group, neither were very forthcoming in giving them to others.\nThis demonstrates a group attempting to learn individually in an environment set up for\ncollaborative learning. It is not possible to do action science alone. If it were possible they\nwould have done it!\n71\nAlike Davis and Kate Denning Almost as helpful as good theory: some conceptual possibilities for the online classroom\nTough Love (9.9)\nGroups who manage both group dynamics and learning dynamics get as close as is possible\nto becoming a learning community. They behave in a collaborative manner, in particular in\nchecking out assumptions and perceptions with other group members.\nKate: I'm going to be really mean now Rod and assume that 'Ooh that's harsh' means I\nhit the nail on the head there. Is my assumption correct?\nThe work of the group takes on an incredible pace and volume: students report logging in\nat all times of the day and night and many independently have talked of how addictive the\nprocess is.\nJackie: I agree about this becoming somewhat addictive. I find myself wanting to\nchecking [sic] several times daily.\nThe consequence of volume and intensity is that considerable insight is developed into the\ninterpersonal processes under exploration through the action science cases.\nJackie: What has been very revealing for me in these 2 days has been the emotion evoked\nat my keyboard. I have had more than a couple of moments where a light has come on, a\nbell clanged, or several ahas. I've been all teared up in several of my responses tonight.\nI've experienced many things sitting and reflecting [...] What I find so amazing and\npossibly the real truth is how all of you see through my coverup.\nAction science, as an organizational intervention, is very powerful but it can raise high\nlevels of anxiety given that the design is to explore participants' interpersonal\nincompetence. Frequently people act out the characteristics of their case during\ninterrogation, and that makes necessary risk-taking. One group had a difficult first\nweek with only three of its members contributing actively to the discussion. After several\ndays Pete (following email correspondence with one of the facilitators) posted this\nmessage:\nPete: I have been following but rather in what to me is an awkward position. I don't\nknow why I suddenly chose to be an observer in this discussion...\nHe received a number of responses from the active members letting him know how hard\nthey had been working to keep the group moving with such low 'attendance'. One of the\nreplies indicated a broader awareness both of the effect his silence had on the group and of\nthe reciprocal nature of the work.\nJackie: I realise that it isn't always easy [sic] to get to your computer but if we can at least\ncheck in at the beginning of the cases and if we are not going to be able to make\ncomments for whatever reasons at least inform each other of that so that we are aware of\nwhat is going on. I think this would help us all to work more effectively as a group. We\nare all presenting cases here and I assume that we would all like all members of the\ngroup to contribute to this otherwise how can we be a group??\nThis marks a clear challenge to the 'observer' stance Pete had been taking - if you want us\nto work for you, then you have to work for us. Pete took up the challenge, apologized to the\ngroup and began making effective interventions. This early friction was one of the key\nmoments for this group who went on to produce some high-quality work.\n72\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nAs has been mentioned earlier one of the elements of the group whose orientation towards\nlearning is collaborative is that the knowledge is constructed together by the sharing of\nthoughts, feelings and knowledge. This building of ideas results in higher-order insights\nthan might be gained individually. One participant commented on how the group seemed\nto be building individual lines of enquiry rather than working together, which, whilst it was\ntrue, was a comment which itself was part of the following scaffold:\nKelly: I find Karen [facilitator] has made an intervention that has set me thinking . . .\nJackie: Just to tag on to K's response...\nMegan: Good job K you've hit a big problem on the head.. . maybe one solution is . . .\nOur model, as it stands, assigns to each of the six conceptual areas four potential states to\ncorrespond to the creation of four ideal group types. This, however, is a misrepresentation\nof the complexity of the model we have created, as much as anything else for neatness of\nexposition. What we are aware of is a third dimension, not accommodated by the 2 by 2\nmatrix, which can indicate possible alternative alignments of the various characteristics of\nbehaviour and their interrelationship. This we have designated depth (the fact that a\nconceptual area can be manifest in a number of ways) and see it as the third dimension of\nthe model which as yet remains in its infancy. The danger, however, here is that we fall into\nthe trap identified by Aarseth:\nthe race is on to conquer and colonise these [learning technologies] for our existing\nparadigms and theories, often in the form of 'the theoretical perspective of <fill in your\nfavourite theory\/theoretician here> is clearly really a prediction\/description of <fill in\nyour favourite digital medium here>.' This method is being used with permutational\nefficiency throughout the fields of digital technology and critical theory, two unlikely\ntango partners indeed. But the combinatorial process shows no sign of exhaustion yet.\n(Aarseth, 1999: 31)\nAt least we are aware of this risk, and we will remind ourselves of it from time to time.\nConclusion\nSo, what, if anything, can we conclude? The model depicted in Figure 1 was the product of\ninspiration and intuition based on our iterative analysis of data collected over a three-year\nperiod and it feels as if it has some explanatory power. We plan to re-examine our data in\nan attempt to confirm the accuracy of the conclusions we have drawn. We then want to\nexamine other data from other online courses that are similar in nature to see if the model,\nas it currently stands, is robust. Then we might be able to tackle the third dimension, depth,\nand the, as yet unmentioned, fourth dimension of time.\nReferences\nAarseth, E.
