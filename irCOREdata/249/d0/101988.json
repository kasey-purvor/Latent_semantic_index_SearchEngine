These systems are\nnot ergodic; their various invariant sets display a rich\nand complicated geometry and support dynamics with\nnontrivial statistical properties. Most of the characteris-\ntics of these systems are not completely understood. Basic\nquestions such as the distribution of periodic points and\nthe coding of the trajectories on the closure of the discon-\ntinuity lines, are still open.

Historically, this was the first\nsituation where they were introduced and numerically\nstudied.1\n~b! They are realizations of discontinuous automorphisms\nof the torus which preserve the Lebesgue measure; in\nparticular they are the piecewise linear versions of the\nwell-known standard map.\n~c! They are closely related to systems representing round-\noff schemes emerging from the numerical simulation of\ndynamical systems, e.g., Refs. 2 and 3.\n~d! They serve as a conjugate model for the first return\nmaps of certain dual billiard systems.4\nThese maps give rise to a complicated interplay between\nregular ~periodic or quasi-periodic! motion and abundant er-\nratic regions whose ergodic and statistical descriptions are\nfar from being understood. Roughly speaking the torus splits\ninto three invariant sets: the discontinuity line and its for-\nward and backward images, the set of periodic points sur-\nrounded by ~quasi-!periodic circles and the complement D8\nof these two sets. Despite the simple form of the isometries,\nthe existence and the nature of these three sets raise several\nquestions. For example, are there periodic orbits of arbi-\ntrarily large period? What is the topological and geometric\nstructure of D8? Does D8 admit dense orbits? Apart from a\nfew cases quoted below, these questions are completely\nopen.\nWe briefly discuss the main rigorous contributions to\nthis field. Goetz in Refs. 5\u20137, gave some general results on\nthe coding and the geometry of the periodic cells. An ex-\nhaustive study of three examples can be found in Refs. 8 and\n9 by using intricate renormalization techniques, the authors\nwere able to characterize the set of periodic points and the\u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/chaos.aip.org\/chaos\/copyright.jsp\n559Chaos, Vol. 13, No. 2, 2003 Rotation on a torus\nDodynamics on D8. A generalization of their techniques to\nother cases seems to be very hard. A related, more arithmetic\nanalysis of the periodic sets can be found in Refs. 2 and 3.\nThe topological entropy of piecewise isometries was shown\nto be zero in dimension 2 in Ref. 10 and in arbitrary dimen-\nsion in Ref. 11. Parallel to these analytic works, there have\nbeen several numerical investigations; they usually con-\nfirmed, in a large variety of situations, the rich behavior\nquoted above, but also revealed new features like the pres-\nence of invariant curves in D8, which suggests that the dy-\nnamics is not transitive on the exceptional set12 and the un-\nboundedness of return times to some subsets of the space. In\nthis paper we focus on the example studied in Ref. 8. This\nsystem, as we will see in the next section, is a piecewise\nrotation depending on one parameter, the angle u . Depend-\ning on whether u\/p is rational or not, the dynamics is dif-\nferent. The set D8 usually displays a \u2018\u2018fractal\u2019\u2019 structure,\nconsisting of complicated patterns, repeated at different\nscales. In order to better understand this structure, we studied\nthe box-counting and the correlation dimension of the set D8\nfor u\/p irrational and the complexity of the language for\nsome rational and irrational u\/p . The former case was done\nin the attempt to check Ashwin\u2019s conjecture that the set D8\nhas positive Lebesgue measure; we give strong numerical\nevidence that the box-counting dimension is 2. Since piece-\nwise isometries have zero topological entropy, the complex-\nity function is a useful tool to illustrate the combinatorial and\narithmetic properties of the dynamics. For our map we find a\nlow-order polynomial complexity; in some cases even\n~piecewise! linear complexity. In the last section we will\ndevelop a general scheme, first introduced in Refs. 2 and 3,\nto conjugate piecewise isometries on a torus with discretized\nrotations on a multidimensional lattice. The algebraic degree\nof the rotation angle is related to the dimension n of\nthe torus: angles of higher algebraic degree tend to produce\nmore complicated systems, and this could explain the differ-\nent behavior encountered in the growth of the complexity\nfunction.\nII. NOTATION\nA. Preliminaries\nWe will follow the notation of Ref. 8. Consider the two-\ndimensional torus V5(R\/Z)2, where Z is the Z2 lattice cen-\ntered at the origin: Z5Z22( 12, 12). We will study the map\ninduced by the matrix\nT~x !5M tx mod Z for M t5S 0 121 t D .\nThe eigenvalues of M t are l1,25(t6At224)\/2. If utu<2,\nthe eigenvalues are on the unit circle and the matrix is ellip-\ntic. Moreover, if t\u201eZ, then M t does not preserve the lattice,\nand iterates of T(x) are not given by the power of M t . The\ntransformation T is discontinuous on the circle @21\/2,1\/2#\n3$1\/2%.

Redistribution subject to AThe determinant of M t is 1 and T is a one-to-one transfor-\nmation, so the Lebesgue measure is preserved. One can eas-\nily check that M t is conjugate to a rotation by a linear\nchange of coordinates x\u00b0Cx , for the following matrix:\nC5S 1 2t\/20 A12t2\/4D .\nLetting cos u5t\/2, we get\nC\u0095M t5R2u\u0095C ,\nwhere Ru is the rotation matrix u .

Figure 1 shows an angle irrational A2p\/4. This\nexample will be further investigated; it also serves as a test\ncase for our numerical algorithms.\nB. Partition and coding\nThe set Vu has a natural partition into three atoms: P0 ,\nthe set of points which remain in the rhombus under the\nrotation and P21 and P1 , the sets of points mapped outside\nof the rhombus at the lower side and the upper side, respec-\ntively ~see Fig. 2!.\nP05$xPVuuR2uxPVu%,\nP215$xPVuu~R2ux !2.~sin u!\/2%,\nP15$xPVuu~R2ux !2,~2sin u!\/2%,\nwhere (x)2 denotes the second component of the vector x.\nNow the transformation becomes a piecewise isometry,\nFu5H f 215R2ux2v if xPP21 ,f 05R2ux if xPP0 ,\nf 15R2ux1v if xPP1 ,\nwhere v5(2cos u, sin u); in Fig. 2 we can see that v\n5a9aW .

We call a cell the set of all the points which\nfollow the same itinerary. The set of cells is therefore the\nquotient of Vu by the equivalence relation \u2018\u2018having the same\ncode:\u2019\u2019\nx;y,i~x !5i~y !.\nAnother way of saying this is that the set of the cells S\n5Vu \/; is the collection of the connected components of\nthe dynamical refinement S5~ i50\n\u2018 Fu\n2iP .

O is the union of the maximal open neighborhoods\n~called periodic islands! surrounding the periodic\npoints. This is an open set, and hence of positive Le-\nbesgue measure. Each point in O is periodic or qua-\nsiperiodic, with a periodic itinerary.\n~ii! Du consists of the discontinuity line and its forward\nand backward images.

Its Lebesgue measure and\nfractal dimension are unknown, except for the ex-\namples discussed in Ref. 8.\nIII. DIMENSION ESTIMATES\nFor most angles u , the set Du8 appears to be fractal in the\nsense that it displays a complicated geometric structure at\nevery scale. Only for the example u5p\/4, the Hausdorff\ndimension is known exactly, and it coincides with the box-\ncounting dimension. For other rational angles ~i.e., u\n5p\/q), the structure becomes more complicated as the de-\nnominator q increases, but the dimension seems to remain\nstrictly less than 2. The irrational case displays an even more\ncomplicated structure. Calculations made in Ref. 13 seem to\nindicate that the dimension is 2. One of our aims is to con-\nfirm this conjecture by different methods. Namely, we carryIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/chaos.aip.org\/chaos\/copyright.jsp\n561Chaos, Vol. 13, No. 2, 2003 Rotation on a torus\nDoFIG. 2.

If for small e , N(e)\nscales as a power law:\nN~e!;e2d\nthen d is defined to be the box-counting dimension of L .

We will work with an approximation of Du obtained by\niterating a set of 10 000 uniformly distributed points on the\ndiscontinuity line. Estimates will be made at various scales\nand on various parts of this set. Basically one considers a\ngrid covering the window to be studied. Because of memory\nconstraints we were unable to consider grids finer than\n500035000. In compensation, we can make the window ar-\nbitrarily small and, with sufficiently long computation time,\nstudy arbitrarily small scales ~up to machine precision ofIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/chaos.aip.org\/chaos\/copyright.jsp\n562 Chaos, Vol. 13, No. 2, 2003 Bruin et al.\nDocourse but in fact computation time is the practical limita-\ntion!. To save memory, the iterations are \u2018\u2018memoryless:\u2019\u2019\neach point of the discontinuity line is checked to be in the\nwindow and increments the number of hits in the cell of the\ngrid in which it falls. In this way, we get a \u2018\u2018density map\u2019\u2019 of\nthe set. It tells us how many nonempty boxes there are.\nMoreover the number of points in each cell gives an estimate\nof the number of points separated by a distance smaller than\nthe diameter of the cell. This gives us a way to estimate the\nbox-counting dimension ~counting the nonempty boxes! and\nthe correlation dimension, assuming the points are uniformly\ndistributed over the cell. This assumption is an oversimplifi-\ncation, but it is a necessary approximation since it is impos-\nsible to consider every possible pairs ~which could be of\norder 1017).\nIn order to perform concrete computations, we must fix\nu . We have chosen u5A2p\/4 ~see Fig. 3!. ~Other choices\nseem to generate sets Du with similar structure.! The set is\nembedded in a unit square ~see Fig. 3!. As we are limited to\na 500035000 grid, computations on the whole set constrains\nus to use e>231024. These scales are quickly saturated,\nthat is to say the values obtained stabilize early. Values of\nbox-counting dimension for e from 1021 to 1022 stabilize at\n1.82, and for e from 231023 to 231024 ~finest grid!, the\nvalue does not exceed 1.89. If we want to go to smaller\nscale, we are led to use a window, at the risk of making a bad\nchoice, where dimensions could be smaller locally. The win-\ndow is chosen so that it does not contain too big holes. Its\nside length 1021, by which we reach scales down to 1025.\nThe return times to this window will of course become\nlonger. Therefore going to even smaller scale, say by a factor\n10, to obtain the same number of points ~up to 512 million!\nin the window would lead to huge computation time.\nIn order to check the method\u2019s efficiency, some tests\nhave been done on the case u5p\/4 for which Hausdorff\ndimension is theoretically known to be ln(3)\/ln(11A2). The\nbox-counting results are collected in Fig. 4, where each point\nis an estimate for a fixed number of points and for a fixed\nscale. The circles indicate scales e from 1022 to 1023, and\nFIG. 3.

The plot shows that we\nfind the theoretical value with reasonably good accuracy.\nThe same is done for u5A2p\/4 in Fig. 5. Here the conver-\ngence is very slow, with scales down to 1025 and the number\nof points up to 109 in the window. The box-counting dimen-\nsion hardly exceeds 1.95. Results for correlation dimension\nare more suggestive, we have a faster value around 1.97, as\nshown in Fig. 6. Furthermore, one can ask if the set shows\ninhomogeneities in its fine fractal structure. In other words,\ndoes the set display multifractal features? One way to inves-\ntigate this aspect is to compute the generalized dimensions\nDq ~see below! and see if we obtain a multifractal spectrum.\nThe standard way to do this is to choose a sequence of points\non L and compute the q-correlation integral ~see Refs. 16\nand 17!, defined as\nFIG. 4.

Ref. 14. We notice that for\nq52, the integral C2(e) is just the number of couples of\npoints separated by a distance less than e , as above.\nIn order to compute this quantity in general, we will\nrefine the method described above. Instead of storing only\nthe number of points in each cell, we will recall the points\nthemselves but each in their respective cells. In this way, we\nobtain a list of points for each cell. To save computation\ntime, we will restrict the computation of the quantity Q(e\n2uXi2X ju) for a given Xi , to the X j in the surrounding cells\nonly. This method computes exactly the quantities Cq but\nneeds much more memory than the previous one. As a con-\nsequence, we cannot use too many points on the attractor: we\nused 5 million points for scales ranging from 1022 to 1023.\nOur experiments show that Dq is constant 2 ~within the\nranges of our computation accuracy!, which gives strong nu-\nmerical evidence that Du8 has a unifractal structure, uniformly\nover Du8 and over scales.\nIV. COMPLEXITY\nExcept for the special case studied in Ref. 8, the lan-\nguage produced by the dynamical system Fu is not under-\nstood. We already know that the entropy is 0 ~cf. Ref. 11!. In\nthis section, we will investigate the complexity of the lan-\nguage numerically. We denote by p(n) the number of sub-\nwords of length n appearing in the language, which is equal\nto the number of cells of order n. The topological entropy of\nFIG. 6.

Redistribution subject to Athe shift is the exponential growth rate of p(n); it coincides\nwith the topological entropy of the system T itself. Hence\np(n) grows subexponentially.\nWe will study several angles, and we will see that the\ncomplexity varies, depending on the rationality of the angle.\nWe can compute complexity in two different ways, by count-\ning subwords in the language, and by counting cells. How-\never, the first method is not very practical. One can only\ncompute the number of subwords of one ~or finitely many!\nvery long words, but in general, we cannot be sure that this\nword contains all possible subwords of the language. There\nis no guarantee that the point whose itinerary is used to count\nthe subwords visits all possible cells. In general, the dynam-\nics on the exceptional set seems to be nonminimal. Figure 7\nshows an example of an infinite but nondense orbit in the\nexceptional set.\nIn order to estimate the complexity of the map in a reli-\nable way, we prefer to compute the n cells themselves ex-\nFIG. 7.

For\np57 however, where the complexity displays a shape simi-\nlar to the previous cases, the plot consists of pieces of curves\nrather than pieces of lines. Moreover the forward differences\nplot is not monotone ~yet roughly increasing! and very dif-\nferent from the previous cases. For p\/8 we did not find the\npiecewise linear behavior within the depth of recursion used.\nHere one can notice that the real numbers 2 cos(p\/q) in the\ntransformation matrix are always algebraic. For q54,5,6,\nthey are quadratic, and we see a common piecewise linear\nbehavior for all of these angles. If n57, then 2 cos(p\/q) is a\ncubic number, and we find a different, piecewise \u2018\u2018smooth,\u2019\u2019\nbehavior for this angle. The next case, q58 gives an alge-\nbraic number of degree 4, and the corresponding plot does\nnot exhibit any piecewise behavior anymore. This suggests a\nrelationship between the complexity of the transformation\nand the algebraic degree of its parameters. Some support for\nthis suggestion emerges from the work of Vivaldi et al.,2,3\nsee Sec. V, where the algebraic degree plays a central role. In\nany case, the complexity tends to increase with denominator\nq. For q.7, the curves computed seem to be best fit ~in the\nsense of least squares! by a power law. Figure 9~a! displays\nFIG. 9.

DISCRETIZED ROTATIONS\nIn this section we will focus on an apparently different\nsubject which turns out to be related to the preceding discus-\nsions. The study of the pathologies induced in dynamical\nsystems by round-off errors is a fairly recent field of inves-\ntigation, attracting an increasing amount of attention ~see, for\nexample, Refs. 2, 3, 20\u201326!.

To illustrate this problem, it is\nhelpful to track the errors precisely in simple systems.\nAmong these systems, we can consider linear maps dis-\ncretized on a uniform ~5 equidistant! lattice ~usually, the\ndiscretization in computer arithmetic is not uniform, leading\nto exponential lattice!. Even in this system the effects of\nrounding-off are far from negligible. Earlier results have\nbeen obtained by Vivaldi and his co-authors ~Refs. 2, 3, 23!.\nIn Ref. 2, a special case of discretized linear map has\nbeen studied, namely ~in the notation of Ref. 2!:\nF:Z2\u2192Z2, F~x ,y !5~ blx c2y ,x !,\nfor l52 cos(2p\/5)5(12A5)\/2. The key argument is that\nthis system is isomorphic to a piecewise isometry on a dense\nsubset of the two-torus, very similar to the ones described in\nthe preceding sections. Moreover, the method used to de-\nscribe the toral system, based on a scaling argument, is\nroughly the same as in Ref. 8.\nGeneralizations of this special result are possible for\neight other values of l , in particular l5(11A5)\/2 ~corre-\nsponding to a rotation by p\/5) and l5A2 ~corresponding to\na rotation by p\/4). Another accessible case, though compu-\ntationally awkward is l5A3, for which the phase portrait\nexhibits no clear self-similarity.\nIn all the mentioned cases, l is a quadratic integer, im-\nplying that the dynamics for the so-called \u2018\u2018localized map\u2019\u2019\ntakes place in a two-dimensional torus. The generalization of\nthis fact is the aim of Ref. 3, where it is shown that higher\ndegree algebraic numbers lead to higher dimensional tori.\nOur interest rather concerns torus maps, so in the follow-\ning sections, we will start from a torus map and show that an\nisomorphism can be found with a discretized map on an\n~eventually! multidimensional lattice, mirroring what is done\nin Ref. 3 in a more elementary way. This isomorphism en-\nables us to carry properties from one system to the other. For\nexample, it immediately connects the conjecture of the\ndenseness of elliptic islands for toral automorphisms to the\nconjectured boundedness of orbits for discretized rotations.\nSecond, as we observed in the preceding section, the com-\nplexity of the toral map x\u00b0M tx(mod Z)2 seems to depend\non the algebraic degree of t52 cos u, where u is the rotation\nangle. The above isomorphisms maps a dense subset E\u02dc t\n3E\u02dc t of the torus ~see below! to the 2d22-dimensional lat-\ntice on which the discretized linear map acts. Although we\ndo not pretend to have a proof, it can be expected that com-\nplexity of discretized linear maps increases with the dimen-\nsion of the lattice.\nThird, as observed in Refs. 8 and 2, the process of gen-\nerating periodic orbits on the torus by a renormalization tech-\nnique, can be translated to produce the periodic orbits on the\ndiscretized lattice by a substitution scheme. Moreover, for\nseveral cases, the shapes of the periodic orbits of the dis-\ncretized rotation can be recovered by a substitution process\nnot unlike the Koch snowflake construction.

Remarks on the quadratic case\nWe saw above that the toral map based on M t and re-\nstricted to Et\n2,T2 is isomorphic to a discretized linear map\nFt . Therefore it is surprising to see that M t and Ft are\nsimultaneously elliptic only in a few cases. In infinitely\nmany cases M t is elliptic while F\u02c6 t is hyperbolic or vice\nversa.

Then the matrices M t and F\u02c6 t are both el-\nliptic if and only if one of them is conjugate to a rational\nrotation.\nProof: First suppose that M t ~or F\u02c6 t) is conjugate to a\nrational rotation. Then utu,2 and t52 cos u for u5pp\/q\nand p ,qPZ. Therefore\ncos~qu!51 or cos~qu!521.\nAssume that cos(qu)51 ~the other case is treated similarly!.\nThen pp\/q for p50,2, . . . ,2(q21) are the solutions of the\nequation cos(qu)2150.

If ut8u.2, then any u8\nParccos(t8\/2) has the form np1iw for some nPZ and w\n\u00de0. But then qu8 has a similar form, and cos(qu8)\u00de1.\nConversely, if we have utu,2 and ut8u,2, then as\nt1t85a and t\u0095t852b ,\nwe have\nuau<utu1ut8u,4 and ubu5utuut8u,4.\nSince a ,bPZ, there are only a finite number of cases.

If both systems are not both ellip-\ntic, the isomorphism can still provide useful insights. For\nexample, if M t is elliptic and F\u02c6 t hyperbolic, it is surprising\nto find the complexity of a hyperbolic system in a subset Et\n2\nof the torus. On the other hand, if F\u02c6 t is elliptic and M t is\nhyperbolic, then the boundedness of all orbits of Ft ~this is\nan important question; there is only partial numerical evi-\ndence for boundedness of orbits! yields that Et\n2 consists of\nperiodic points.

Again, this\nwas done by using very careful and precise numerical pro-\ncedures. In particular, we detected a relationship between the\ncomplexity of the transformation and the algebraic degree of\nits parameters.

The forward iterates of the\ndiscontinuity line for the toral map\nconjugate to F2A2 .an isomorphism between the piecewise rotations and ~multi-\ndimensional! discretized rotations. We first generalized some\nrecent results by Vivaldi and co-workers, which are of an\nintrinsic interest, especially for the possibility to conjugate\nelliptic and hyperbolic dynamics, as we pointed out in Sec.\nV. It is also interesting to note that these results seem to\ncontradict a conjecture made by Ashwin et al. in Ref. 29. In\nthat paper, the planar piecewise isometries based on convex\npolygons were expected to have a complexity at most qua-\ndratic while we exhibited polynomial exponents significantly\ngreater for our case.\nComing back to the relationship with complexity, we\nwant to make the following technical observations. Recall\nthat the piecewise isometry was characterized by a parameter\nu . The fact that u52 cos(p\/q) for q54,5,6 are quadratic\nimplies that the discretized rotation takes place on a two-\ndimensional lattice; they have a common phase space and a\ncommon complexity behavior. Numbers of higher algebraic\ndegree require higher dimensional lattices: if u is of degree\nd, then the lattice is of dimension 2(d21). This increase of\ndimension is parallel to the increase of the complexity dis-\ncussed in Sec. IV.\nRigorous mathematical methods to substantiate the nu-\nmerical conclusions are still elusive. This is another interest-\ning and promising direction in the understanding of piece-\nwise isometries.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank P. Ashwin, A. Goetz, P.
