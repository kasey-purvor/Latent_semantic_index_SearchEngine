However, HIV prevalence declines can \noccur in the absence of behaviour change due to the natural dynamics of epidemics [3] and changes \nin reported behaviour may be due largely to changes in social desirability bias resulting from the \nimpact of AIDS mortality on social norms [4]. Thus, establishing whether declines in HIV \nprevalence have been caused by reductions in risk behaviour is not straightforward [5]. Where \ndeclines in HIV prevalence can be attributed to changes in behaviour, a further question arises as to \nwhether these changes resulted from HIV prevention activities. This is a particular concern given \nthat community randomised trials have yielded disappointing results on the effectiveness of \nbehavioural interventions [6-9]. As a result of these difficulties - and limited possibilities for \necological comparisons due to the similarity of programmatic responses in countries with and \nwithout declines in HIV prevalence - there is still very little scientific evidence for the success of \nHIV prevention programmes in reducing infection rates in sub-Saharan African countries. \n \nHIV prevalence has fallen in Zimbabwe from 25.3% (uncertainty bounds, 23.6%-27.1%) in 1997 to \n13.7% (11.9%-15.0%) in 2009 [10, 11]. HIV incidence has also declined [10] and mathematical \nmodel fits to surveillance data suggest an acceleration in this decline due to reductions in risk \nbehaviour occurring between 1999 and 2004 [12]. Survey data show reductions in reports of \nmultiple sexual partnerships and sustained high levels of condom use in casual partnerships over \nthe same period [10, 13]. These epidemiological and behaviour trends coincided with a period of \nscale-up of national HIV control programmes in Zimbabwe [14]. However, this period was also \nmarked by high AIDS mortality [10, 15]  and the beginnings of a severe economic downturn [16] in \nthe country. Thus, as elsewhere, the contribution of HIV control programmes to the reductions in \nHIV infection rates and associated risk behaviour in Zimbabwe remains unclear. \n \nOne little explored approach to assessing the contribution of national HIV prevention programmes \nto reductions in HIV risk is to examine their coverage and impact in prospective community \nsurveys. In this article, we use prospective data from a large-scale general population cohort of \ninitially uninfected individuals in eastern Zimbabwe, collected between 1998 and 2003 (i.e. \ncovering the period when the most rapid reductions in HIV prevalence and high risk sexual \nbehaviour were observed) to describe patterns of association between exposure to HIV prevention \nprogrammes, relatives with AIDS and unemployment and psychological factors believed to mediate \nbehaviour change, observed changes in reported behaviour and levels of HIV incidence. \n \n \n 5\nMethods \n \nTheoretical framework \n \nWe use a simplified theoretical model structure for our exploration of the effects of HIV prevention \nprogrammes and changes in epidemiological and socio-economic context on individuals\u2019 adoption \nof behaviours that are less risky for HIV infection (Fig. 1). Adoption of safer behaviours is taken to \nbe mediated by a number of psychological attributes including knowledge about HIV\/AIDS, \nperceived personal risk of infection [17] and self-efficacy [18]. Individuals\u2019 socio-demographic \ncharacteristics, including their sex, age, education, marital status and income levels, may influence \nthese psychological attributes, along with aspects of their social networks such as partner, \nhousehold and extended family characteristics and membership of social groups [19]. These local \nnetworks are influenced, in turn, by the social norms that prevail within the wider community. \n \nA change in the socio-economic environment, such as an increase in poverty, could lead to changes \nin behaviour patterns. For example, in a setting where men are the main cash income earners and \ntransactional sex is common, reductions in male incomes (through job loss and high inflation) could \nlead to safer behaviour. Other things being equal, the rise in poverty might also be expected to draw \nmore women into unprotected transactional sex; however, the combination of extensive HIV\/AIDS \nprevention programming and high AIDS mortality could limit this effect. A distinction in \nprogrammes can be drawn between those that are directed primarily to individuals (e.g. television \nand radio campaigns) and those that are directed to the local community (e.g. HIV\/AIDS meetings), \nalthough changes in individual attitudes and behaviour may eventually generate feedbacks into the \ncommunity. Indeed, these two forms of programmes may have synergistic effects, in that the first \ntypically focus on improving knowledge, while the second often seek to increase levels of risk \nperception and self-efficacy [20] and could lead to collective renegotiation of social norms [21]. \nThis seems particularly likely where there is high exposure to AIDS mortality. \n \nIn this paper, we begin to test this framework by using regression models to investigate the separate \neffects of exposure to HIV programmes, relatives with AIDS and unemployment on psychological \nstatus, sexual risk behaviour and HIV incidence.   \n \nData \n \nData from the first two rounds of the Manicaland General Population Cohort Survey were used in \nthis study. The detailed procedures followed in the survey have been published [13]. In brief, we \nconducted a baseline census of all households in twelve predominantly rural study sites in a phased \n 6\nmanner (one site at a time) between July 1998 and February 2000. Random samples of men aged \n15\u201354 years and women aged 17-44 years resident within the study households was recruited into \nan open cohort. A follow-up census and survey were conducted in each of the same sites three years \nlater (July 2001 to February 2003). All baseline respondents were included amongst those \nconsidered eligible at follow-up. Data on onset of sexual activity were collected in standard face-to-\nface interviews. However, to reduce social desirability bias in reports on numbers of sexual \npartnerships and unprotected casual sex, in most cases, these data were collected using Informal \nConfidential Voting Interviews (ICVI) [22]. HIV serological testing was done on dried blood spot \nspecimens using a highly sensitive and specific antibody dipstick assay. Written informed consent \nwas sought as a condition of enrolment and continuation in the study. Prior ethical approval for the \nstudy was obtained from the Research Council of Zimbabwe (Number 02187) and the Applied and \nQualitative Research Ethics Committee in Oxford, United Kingdom (N97.039). \n \nFollowing these procedures, 98% and 94% of the households identified in the survey areas at \nbaseline and follow-up, respectively, were enumerated. Individual participation rates were 79% in \nboth rounds of the survey. Sixty-one percent of those interviewed at baseline (and not known to \nhave died subsequently) were re-interviewed at follow-up. Out-migration was the principal reason \nfor loss-to-follow-up with only 1% of baseline respondents declining to participate in the next \nround of the survey. \n \nStatistical analysis \n \nThe analysis of the reported exposures, reported behaviours and HIV incidence was conducted \nusing data from the closed cohort of individuals who were uninfected at baseline and were re-\ninterviewed and re-tested at follow-up. Coverage of programme activities, exposure to relatives sick \nwith or dying from AIDS and unemployment were estimated and compared for members of this \ncohort at baseline and follow-up. Individuals who reported having heard HIV\/AIDS messages \nthrough the national media (television, radio or newspapers) five or more times in the last month \nwere treated as having been exposed to media campaigns \u2013 making the results for this indicator \nconservative since individuals with lower and\/or less recent exposure were included in the \ncomparison group. In six of the twelve sites, an intensive programme of peer education meetings \nwith women engaging in commercial sex work and their prospective male clients was implemented \nbetween 1998 and 2003 [7]. This intervention reduced unprotected casual sex and HIV incidence in \nmen reached by the programme but did not reduce risk behaviour or HIV incidence at the \ncommunity level. Since these activities have been evaluated separately [7] and were not \nrepresentative of the national response in rural areas [23], survey participants from the intervention \nsites in this trial were excluded from the analysis of the effects of HIV\/AIDS meetings.  \n 7\nAssociations between reported primary exposures (i.e. AIDS mortality, HIV\/AIDS programmes \netc.) and psychological status at recruitment were measured for males and females separately using \nlogistic regression. This was done so that the mediating effects on behaviour and HIV incidence of \nimproved psychological status resulting from the primary exposures could be measured over the \nsubsequent inter-survey period. Knowledge about HIV\/AIDS was measured using an index \nconstructed from responses to a series of questions about modes of transmission, protective \nmeasures and symptoms [24]. Risk perception and self-efficacy were measured using responses to \nthe questions: \u201cDo you think you could become infected with HIV yourself in the future?\u201d and \u201cDo \nyou think there are things you can do to avoid becoming infected?\u201d respectively. Tests for effects \non subsequent sexual behaviour were measured using prospective data spanning the 3-year inter-\nsurvey period (1998-2000 to 2001-2003). Four sexual risk behaviour outcomes were investigated \nusing logistic regression \u2013 initiation of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex \nwith a casual partner and (for married respondents) spouse being unfaithful. Poisson regression was \nused to test for associations with subsequent sexual behaviour and incident HIV infection. All tests \nwere controlled for sex, age and clustering at the village level with results being considered \nsignificant at the 95% confidence level. Tests that included sexual behaviour indicators as \nindependent or dependent variables were also controlled for interview method and tests that \nmeasured associations with subsequent behaviour and incident HIV infection were adjusted for \nprior sexual risk behaviour (number of new partners in the year before baseline interview and, \nwhere necessary, onset of sexual relations). In analysing the effects of programme and other \nexposures on having an unfaithful spouse, women with polygamous husbands were excluded and \nresults were adjusted for whether or not the respondent reported an unfaithful spouse at baseline. \nOur analysis of national HIV prevalence trends shows that risk of HIV changed around the period \nof data collection [12] and we are interested in the behaviour changes following an exposure, \ntherefore, in this part of the analysis, for each exposure variable, individual participants who had \nnot been exposed at baseline but who were exposed during the inter-survey period were excluded \u2013 \nso, for example, sexual behaviour and HIV incidence were compared between individuals who had \nhad a relative with AIDS prior to baseline and those who still reported not having had a relative \nwith AIDS when interviewed again in the follow-up survey. \n \nIn addition, to assess the contributions of HIV prevention programmes and background factors to \nbehaviour change, multi-variable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for \ndecreasing or maintaining low risk behaviour between the baseline and follow-up survey interviews \nin the intervention control areas, by presence and timing of exposure (i.e. prior to or only after \nrecruitment). Decreasing risk was defined as having reduced the number of new sexual partners in \nthe past year and low risk behaviour was defined as having no new partners in the past year. Odds \n 8\nratios were adjusted for age group, education, marriage, competing factors, interview method and \nclustering at the village level.  \n \n \nResults \n \nAssociations between psychological status, sexual risk behaviour and HIV incidence \n \nConsistent with the theoretical framework, increased knowledge about HIV\/AIDS was associated \nwith lower HIV incidence (aIRR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.00) and greater self-efficacy showed a non-\nsignificant protective association (aIRR 0.76; 0.44-1.31), whilst respondents perceiving a risk of \nHIV infection experienced higher incidence (aIRR 1.68; 1.16-2.42). As reported previously, self-\nreports of initiating sex amongst respondents who were virgins at baseline (1.75% versus 0.6%; \naOR 3.59; 95% CI, 1.42-9.02), multiple sexual partners (3.2% versus 1.4%; aOR 2.08; 1.44-3.00) \nand unprotected casual sex (3.2% versus 1.6%; aOR 1.70; 1.19-2.43) during the 3-year inter-survey \nperiod were each associated with higher risk of having acquired HIV infection during this period \n[25]. Among married respondents, having an unfaithful spouse showed a non-significant \nassociation (1.9% versus 1.7%; aOR 1.36; 0.89-2.08) \n \nExposure to HIV prevention programmes, relatives with AIDS and unemployment \n \nAt baseline, 30% (95% CI, 29%-32%) of the cohort reported recent repeated exposure to \nHIV\/AIDS messages through the national media (Fig. 2). At follow-up, this figure had increased to \n39% (37%-40%). Baseline exposure was greater for males (42%; 40%-45%) than for females \n(22%; 20%-24%) but increases over time were recorded for both sexes. A much smaller non-\nsignificant increase was seen in lifetime attendance at HIV\/AIDS meetings (from 27%; 25%-29% \nto 29%; 27%-31%) with both sexes reporting similar levels of attendance at each interview.  \n \nA substantial increase was recorded in the proportion of the cohort reporting having had a relative \nwith AIDS between the first (30%; 95% CI, 29%-32%) and second (47%; 46%-49%) rounds of the \nsurvey. More women than men reported relatives with AIDS at baseline (34% (32%-36%) versus \n25% (23%-27%)) but both sexes reported increases of approximately 50% during the inter-survey \nperiod. Unemployment fell from 75% (74%-77%) at baseline to 70% (68%-71%) at follow-up, \npossibly reflecting selective out-migration of individuals who were made redundant or left their \njobs. More women (90%; 89%-92%) than men (54%; 52%-56%) were unemployed at baseline and \nsimilar modest reductions over time were seen in both sexes. \n \n 9\nProgramme exposure, psychological status and subsequent risk of HIV infection \n \nTable 1 shows the results of the analysis of the effects on psychological status, subsequent sexual \nrisk behaviour and HIV incidence of individual level characteristics (including unemployment), \nhaving a relative with AIDS and programmatic activities suggested in the theoretical model as \ninfluencing behaviour.   \n \nMen and women with more education had better knowledge, lower risk perception (for men) and \ngreater self-efficacy. More educated men had similar behaviour and HIV risk to less educated men \nduring the 3-year inter-survey period but more educated women were more likely to report multiple \nsexual partnerships and showed a trend towards higher risk of acquiring HIV (2.1% versus 1.1%; \naIRR 1.44; 95% CI, 0.96-2.16). Married men were more likely to express self-efficacy than \nunmarried men while married women had less knowledge and lower self-efficacy than unmarried \nwomen. However, marriage was associated with fewer multiple sexual partnerships and less \nunprotected casual sex for both sexes and with a lower risk of having become infected, particularly \nfor women (1.2% versus 2.2%; aIRR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73). \n \nUnemployed men had less risk perception and showed a trend towards lower HIV incidence \ncompared to those in employment (1.7% versus 2.4%; aIRR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47-1.20) but no \ndifferences in behaviour were observed. In women, unemployment also showed a non-significant \nnegative association with HIV incidence (1.5% versus 2.1%; aIRR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.34-1.46) and \nwas associated with fewer reports of multiple sexual partnerships and unprotected casual sex during \nthe inter-survey period. In men, having relatives with AIDS was associated with greater self-\nefficacy but did not show an effect on behaviour or HIV incidence. Women with relatives with \nAIDS had enhanced levels of knowledge, risk perception and self-efficacy and showed a trend \ntowards reduced risk of becoming infected with HIV (1.2% versus 2.0%; aIRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.40-\n1.08); however, no clear behavioural pathway was apparent in the data. \n \nExposure to media campaigns and HIV\/AIDS meetings was associated with better knowledge and \ngreater self-efficacy for men (borderline significant for the effect of HIV\/AIDS meetings on self-\nefficacy) and for women (Table 1). Exposure to media campaigns did not translate into safer \nbehaviours or reduced HIV incidence for either sex. However, women who had attended HIV\/AIDS \nmeetings showed non-significant but consistent trends towards fewer multiple sexual partners (aOR \n0.65; 95% CI, 0.37-1.13), less unprotected casual sex (aOR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.33-1.07) and lower \nHIV incidence (0.9% versus 1.8%; aIRR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24) in the inter-survey period. The \ntrend towards reduced HIV incidence remained after further adjustment for AIDS mortality and \nindividual characteristics as potential confounders (aIRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.34-1.28).   \n 10\nProgramme exposure and behaviour change \n \nA substantial reduction was recorded in the mean number of new sexual partners reported in the \npast year over the period 1998-2003 by individuals who were uninfected at baseline. Amongst men, \nthe mean number fell by 50% from 1.02 (95% CI, 0.90-1.15) to 0.52 (0.46-0.57), whilst, in women, \nthere was a reduction of 53% from 0.19 (0.15-0.23) to 0.09 (0.07-0.11). In general, men and women \nexposed to HIV prevention programmes, relatives with AIDS and unemployment, before or during \nthe inter-survey period, did not show greater reductions in risk behaviour than those who did not \nreport exposure (Fig. 3). However, women who had attended HIV\/AIDS meetings prior to \nrecruitment were more likely than women who had never attended these meetings to reduce their \nrisk behaviour or to maintain low risk behaviour (96.4% versus 90.8%; aOR 3.09; 95% CI, 1.27-\n7.49). Newly unemployed men (84.2% versus 76.0%; aOR 2.13; 95% CI, 0.98-4.59) tended to be \nmore likely than men in employment to adopt or maintain safer behaviour. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe results of this analysis provide some encouragement that HIV prevention programmes may \nhave contributed to the decline in HIV prevalence and the associated reductions in risk behaviour \nseen in eastern Zimbabwe in the late 1990s and early 2000s [13]. In the predominantly rural study \nsettings, programme coverage increased during this period and was associated, for both sexes, with \nbetter knowledge and greater self-efficacy; attributes that, in turn, were protective against HIV \ninfection. For women, attendance at community-based HIV\/AIDS meetings was directly associated \nwith increased adoption of safer behaviours and a substantial (one-third) but non-significant \nreduction in HIV incidence.  \n \nExposure to relatives dying from AIDS is associated with lower HIV incidence in women in this \ncohort [25]. However, we found no evidence for differences in rates of behaviour reduction by \nexposure to AIDS mortality. Previously, we have found that greater poverty (measured using an \nasset index) is associated with higher HIV incidence in men [26]. In this analysis, we explored the \neffect of unemployment (possibly a better indicator of current income). Overall, unemployment \nrates were high (75%) but did not increase over the period 1998-2003. Unemployment showed a \ntrend towards lower HIV incidence in both sexes and we found a borderline significant association \nbetween recent loss of employment and adoption of safer behaviour in men. Caution is needed in \ninterpreting these findings since individuals who lost their jobs but remained in the study areas may \ndiffer from those who migrated and were lost to follow-up.  \n \n 11\nIn a context of high exposure to AIDS mortality and escalating poverty [16], HIV prevention \nprogramme activities (and particularly community-based HIV\/AIDS meetings [19]) may have led \nto changes in social norms which, in turn, could have influenced the behaviour of individuals who \nwere not themselves exposed to these activities - both directly and through changes in the \navailability and characteristics of prospective partners. If so, we may have underestimated the \nimpact of HIV programmes since those affected indirectly in this way were included in the \nreference categories in our analysis. This analysis is also limited in that the data on HIV prevention \nprogrammes were restricted to exposure to media campaigns and HIV\/AIDS meetings. Sexual risk \nbehaviour can be reduced following counselling and testing, particularly amongst those who receive \nHIV positive results, but uptake was low in this population during the study period [27]. \nNevertheless, other programmes such as HIV prevention activities in schools, initiated in the early \n1990s, may have resulted in adoption of safer behaviours [23]. \n \nIn some instances we found evidence for associations between individual characteristics and HIV \nincidence without there being clear behavioural pathways explaining these associations. This could \nbe due to limited statistical power to conduct subgroup analyses, limitations in the behavioural \nvariables examined (e.g. no data were collected on position within local sexual networks) or to \nreporting bias. The data covering the 3-year inter-survey period may be subject to recall bias. Social \ndesirability bias may increase with exposure to HIV programmes leading to overestimation of their \neffects on behaviour; we minimised this bias, however, by using the ICVI method. \n \nThese limitations notwithstanding, this study provides an example of how prospective data from a \npopulation-based cohort can be used in evaluations of HIV prevention programmes. Community \nrandomised controlled trials (CRCTs) can help in establishing the effectiveness of interventions in \nspecific epidemiological contexts [28] under carefully controlled conditions [29]. However, these \ntrials are becoming increasingly complex and expensive to implement, particularly given the ethical \nrequirement to provide HIV prevention services already proven to be effective to participants in \nboth intervention and control groups [30]. Furthermore, alternative methods such as those applied \nin the current study, are needed when the aim is to evaluate the impact of HIV prevention \nprogrammes when scaled-up in \u201creal world\u201d circumstances that extend beyond the confines of a \ntrial setting. More studies of this nature could be useful and, especially, when done in combination \nwith mathematical modelling [31] to examine the impact of behaviour changes associated with \nparticular interventions (including treatment) on trends in HIV infection. \n \nThis study was undertaken in Zimbabwe\u2019s eastern province of Manicaland. Patterns of programme \nimplementation and coverage are likely to have varied across the country. However, the increase in \nprogramme coverage observed here coincided with a period when the National AIDS Council and \n 12\nNational AIDS Trust Fund were established in Zimbabwe to coordinate and promote the national \nresponse to HIV\/AIDS. Following this initiative, similar increases in programme coverage were \nobserved in national surveys [14]. Furthermore, the declines in HIV prevalence and risk behaviour \nfound in the current study sites have also been observed in the national population [32]. Therefore \nHIV prevention programmes could have had similar effects in other parts of the country to those \nseen here in Manicaland. \n \n \n \nConflicts of interest: \n \nNone. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank the Wellcome Trust for funding support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13\nFigure captions \n \n \nFig. 1.
