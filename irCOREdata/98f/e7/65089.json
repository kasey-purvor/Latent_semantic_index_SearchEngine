Sun: corona, magnetic \felds\n1. Introduction\nMany dynamic events in the Sun\u2019s corona are largely dom-\ninated by the magnetic \feld. Often, three-dimensional\nmodels of such events need to incorporate considerations\nof the topology of the magnetic \feld, for example, flares\n(Sweet 1969; Machado 1983; Lau 1993; Aulanier et al.\n1998), jets (Yokoyama & Shibata 1996; Shibata et al.\n1996) and reconnection in general (Schindler et al. 1988;\nHesse & Schindler 1988; Hornig & Rasta\u00a8tter 1997, 1998;\nPriest & Forbes 2000). To understand these phenomena,\nit is helpful to consider the topological structure of their\nmagnetic \felds.\nThe topological structure, or skeleton, of a magnetic\n\feld is de\fned by the con\fguration of the flux sources\n(which are not necessarily balanced), the null points\n(where the magnetic \feld vanishes) and the network of\nspine \feld lines and separatrix surfaces (Priest et al. 1997).\nFor each null the eigenvalues of the magnetic \feld can\nbe calculated. Since r:B = 0 the sum of the eigenval-\nues must be zero (Cowley 1973; Fukao et al. 1975; Greene\n1988; Lau & Finn 1991; Parnell et al. 1996), so this will\nnormally mean that two eigenvalues are of one sign (say,\nnegative) and the other is of opposite sign (say, positive).\nIn the plane of the eigenvectors corresponding to the two\nnegative eigenvalues there is a fan of \feld lines which con-\nverge into the null (or radiate out from it when the eigen-\nvalues are positive) and make up a separatrix surface. In\nthe direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the lone\npositive eigenvalue there is a spine \feld line, which comes\nSend o\u000bprint requests to: D. S.

The structure of a three-dimensional magnetic \feld\nnear a linear null point\nout of the null (or goes in when the eigenvalue is negative)\n(Priest & Titov 1996; Lau & Finn 1990). An example of\nthis is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe separatrix surfaces divide the volume into regions\nwhere all the \feld lines have the same connectivity be-\ntween flux sources. For example, a single separatrix sur-\nface will divide the volume into two regions of connectivity,\neach region on either side of the separatrix surface. So the\nmagnetic topology describes how regions of \feld line con-\nnectivity are positioned relative to one another and which\nregions border one another.\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20010016\n340 D. S. Brown and E. R. Priest: Null points in the corona\nIt is convenient when studying solar coronal magnetic\ntopology to work with potential \felds (i.e., static \felds\nwith r\u0002B = 0) and to adopt the magnetic charge topol-\nogy method described by Longcope (1996). Here the flux\nsources in the photosphere are modelled as point sources\nlying on a plane and the coronal volume is normally taken\nto be the upper half plane. This formulation gives the sim-\nple analytical expression\nB(r) =\nX\ni\n\u000fi\nr \u2212 ri\njr \u2212 rij3\n;\nfor the resulting magnetic \feld, where ri is the position of\nthe ith source and \u000fi is its strength.\nIt should be noted that the approximation of coronal\nmagnetic \felds by equilibrium models such as potential\n\felds is valid when the plasma velocities are much smaller\nthan the Alfv\u0013en speed so that the coronal \feld evolves\nthrough a series of equilibria. This is, for example, \fne\nduring the usual evolution of active regions, although of-\nten force-free models are more appropriate than potential\nmodels, especially during the slow storage of excess en-\nergy before a solar flare. It certainly fails during the rapid\nphase of an eruptive flare when speeds are no longer much\nsmaller than the Alfv\u0013en speed. Furthermore, it should be\nnoted that the strength of single magnetic sources can\nchange either by their fragmentation into two or more\nsources, by the merging of two or more sources, or by\nthe appearance (or disappearance) by flux emergence (or\nsubmergence) of a positive-negative bipolar pair.\nModelling photospheric flux sources (of radius \u000e, say)\nby point sources of zero radius is a reasonable approxi-\nmation provided one is further than a distance \u000e from the\nsource. This would be typically 200 km for an intense pho-\ntospheric flux tube, a few megametres for a pore and about\n10 Mm for a sunspot. A possible way to avoid the singu-\nlarity would be to place a source below the photosphere,\nbut this has the disadvantage of making flux pass through\nthe whole photosphere. Preferable would be to model a\nsource by a circular region of radius \u000e in the photosphere\nat which the normal \feld is uniform and outside which it\nvanishes (Lothian & Browning 1995). At distances much\nlarger than \u000e from the source, this would give a \feld struc-\nture that is very similar to the structure due to a point\nsource.\nGenerally, in a \fnite region of the solar surface the\nmagnetic flux does not balance, since flux leaves (or en-\nters) the region to (or from) other sources at large dis-\ntances (R, say). Therefore, this paper usually consid-\ners an unbalanced set of sources by essentially putting\nthe balancing source at in\fnity (e.g., Inverarity & Priest\n1999). This is a good approximation at distances that are\nsmall compared to R, since, when viewed from such a dis-\ntance the group of unbalanced sources resembles the uni-\npolar \feld due to a single source of strength equal to the\nimbalance.\nBrown & Priest (1999a) have used this approach to\nclassify completely the topological behaviour resulting\nfrom three sources. They described the key bifurcation\nFig. 2. Three-dimensional \feld line plot showing the double-\nintersecting-detached topological state due to three negative\nsources (labelled 1, 2 and 3) and a positive source (labelled\n4). The solid lines show the fan \feld lines, the thick lines show\nthe spine \feld lines, the dashed lines represent separators, the\nasterisks are sources and the dots are null points\nbehaviour that occurs when one topological state is per-\nturbed and changes into di\u000berent state. One particular bi-\nfurcation, called the global separator bifurcation, describes\nhow two separatrix surfaces can interact and give birth to\na separator.\nA separator is the \feld line that marks the intersec-\ntion of two separatrix surfaces and borders four regions of\ndi\u000berent connectivity. Separators are believed to be loca-\ntions where current ribbons form and reconnection can\ntake place (Longcope 1996; Priest & Titov 1996). The\ntopological behaviour of separators has been investigated\nfurther by Brown & Priest (1999b). They study how four\nunbalanced sources can give rise to multiple separators\nin the corona, and how these separators can interact. In\nparticular, they describe how two separators can merge to\nform a single separator (although this technically involves\nthree other separators lying in the photosphere).\nFigure 2 shows a topological state, which will be re-\nferred to as the double-intersecting-detached state, due to\nfour sources. Three of the sources are negative and the\nfourth is positive. The three negative sources outweigh the\npositive source. There are three null points and these give\nrise to three separatrix surfaces. One of the surfaces forms\na separatrix dome which has the three negative sources\nand three null points lying on its boundary, while the pos-\nitive source is completely enclosed by the dome. There\nare also two separatrix walls which divide the interior of\nthe dome into three segments. Each segment contains \feld\nlines which connect the positive source to one of the neg-\native sources (a di\u000berent source for each segment). The\nseparatrix walls continue outside the dome, and divide the\nexternal region into three subregions, where the remain-\ning flux from each of the negative sources radiates out to\nin\fnity (or other \\hypothetical\" sources a large distance\naway). Figure 3 shows the intersection of the separatrices\nwith the z = 0 plane, which clearly shows the di\u000berent\nregions of connectivity and how they border one another.\nD. S. Brown and E. R. Priest: Null points in the corona 341\nFig. 3. Field line plot showing the intersection of the separatrix\ndome and walls of the double-intersecting-detached topological\nstate with the z = 0 plane. The solid lines show the fan \feld\nlines, the thicker lines show the spine \feld lines, the dashed\nlines represent the projection of the separators onto the z = 0\nplane, the asterisks are sources and the dots are null points\nThe two separatrix walls intersect the separatrix dome in\ntwo separators, both of which begin at one of the null\npoints and end up at the remaining null points.\nThe long-term goal is to understand the complex\ntopology of coronal magnetic \felds due to many sources\n(Seehafer 1985, 1986), by constructing the skeletons of the\ndi\u000berent topologies and understanding the bifurcations\nfrom one topology to another. Although the potential \feld\ndue to three sources is fully understood (Brown & Priest\n1999a), the four-source case has no complete understand-\ning, even though several authors have investigated various\naspects.\nFor example, Molodenskii & Syrovatskii (1977) dis-\ncussed the existence of null points out of the z = 0\nplane, and suggested that their number and position are\ndetermined by the number of sources and their posi-\ntions, though they generally considered balanced \felds.\nTopologies incorporating null points out of the z = 0 plane\nwere also considered by Lau (1993) for a class of solar\nflare models. However, to obtain these nulls the magnetic\nsources were set at di\u000berent levels beneath the z = 0 plane\nGorbachev et al. (1988) considered how topologies due\nto four balanced sources (arranged as two bipoles) can\nproduce separators, the formation of which may act as a\ntrigger for a solar flare. They examined how the sources\ncan be perturbed from a topological con\fguration without\na separator to a state where a separator is present. They\nalso considered how the magnetic \feld along the separa-\ntor can reverse direction as the sources pass through criti-\ncal con\fgurations. This work was continued by Gorbachev\n& Somov (1988) who studied the e\u000bect that varying the\nsource strengths of these bipoles has on the shape of\nthe polarity inversion line (PIL). Fixing the positions\nof the sources they demonstrated that, by varying the rel-\native source strengths, the curvature of the S-like shape of\nthe PIL would change. They also showed that a separator\ncan appear and they related the \feld structure about the\nseparator to the plasma structure seen during two-ribbon\nflares.\nBungey et al. (1996) considered two, three and four\nsource cases where the sources are placed at di\u000berent\nheights beneath the z = 0 plane in such a way that\nbald patches, places where a \feld line grazes the z = 0\nplane, are present. They investigated the behaviour of bald\npatches in an evolving con\fguration similar to that used\nby Gorbachev & Somov (1988), particularly how a bald\npatch can appear and split into two separate bald patches.\nTogether, these works give only a partial understanding of\nthe complexity of four-source con\fgurations.\nInverarity & Priest (1999) modelled the magnetic\nstructure of the quiet Sun by placing magnetic sources\nand sinks on a hexagonal network of supergranule cells.\nIn particular, they considered a simple three-cell network\ncon\fguration of twelve unit sources and the e\u000bect of in-\ncreasing the strength of a central source and moving it\naround. They found many null points in the plane of the\nsources and out of the plane when the central (negative)\nsource is smaller in magnitude than the sum of the (pos-\nitive) strengths of the surrounding sources. The main re-\nsults of the study were to show how complex the topology\nof the coronal \feld is and to use Euler characteristics to\nrelate the numbers of null points and sources.\nThe aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it will\ncontinue to explore the nature of the topology due to\nfour sources as one of the building blocks of even more\ncomplex con\fgurations. Secondly, in view of the poten-\ntial importance of null points in the corona, which were\ndemonstrated in one particular quiet-Sun con\fguration by\nInverarity & Priest (1999), the object is to explore in de-\ntail the nature of the simplest con\fguration with a coro-\nnal null and a bifurcation that causes such a null point to\nbe born or die. Such a con\fguration may form part of\nmany more structures than just the simple network\ncon\fguration.\n2. Null points in the corona\n2.1. Analytical example of a coronal null\nOften, null points of topological states due to three or four\nsources lie in the plane z = 0 (Brown & Priest 1999a). This\nis not always the case, however, and it is possible for null\npoints to lift o\u000b from the z = 0 plane. However, in gen-\neral it has not been established how common coronal nulls\nare in the solar corona. For example, the particular quiet-\nSun network con\fguration of Inverarity & Priest (1999)\nof three hexagonal cells of unit positive sources with a\ncentral negative source had at most one coronal null and\nbetween 12 and 20 photospheric nulls.\nConsider now, a simple example with three sources\nof equal strength, \u000fs = \u22121, positioned equidistant from\neach other in an triangular formation. Now place a posi-\ntive source of unit strength in the centre of the triangular\nformation, as shown in Fig. 4. Taking the origin at the\n342 D. S. Brown and E. R.

By symmetry, it is clear that there\nis a null point lying on the y-axis (i.e., x = 0 and z = 0).\nAlong this line Bx = Bz = 0 and By is given by Eq.

By rotational symmetry\nthere are two further nulls at a distance \u00190.91 from the\norigin, along the lines y = x cos\u0019=6 and y = x cos 5\u0019=6.\nHowever, this does not account for all of the nulls.\nAlong the z-axis (x = y = 0) Bx = By = 0, and Eq. (3)\nbecomes\nBz(0; 0; z) =\nz\njzj3 \u2212\n3z\n(1 + z2)3=2\n\u0001 (5)\nSetting this to zero produces exactly one null point above\nthe plane z = 0 satisfying\n8z6 \u2212 3z4 \u2212 3z2 \u2212 1 = 0; (6)\nwhich gives z \u0019 0:962.\nThe topology is shown in Fig. 5. There are three ver-\ntical separatrix walls which meet at the spine of the null\nout of the plane. This spine is connected to the central\npositive source. Each of the separatrix walls includes one\nof the null points which lie in the z = 0 plane. Enclosing\nthe central positive source there is a separatrix dome on\nwhich lie the remaining three sources and all of the nulls.\nThe three separatrix walls intersect the separatrix dome\nat separators (shown dashed in Fig. 5). These separators\nmeet at the null out of the plane and connect it to each\nof the three nulls in the z = 0 plane. The null point which\nlies out of the plane marks the point where all three of the\nseparatrix walls and the separatrix dome meet.\n2.2. Varying the central source strength\nSuppose now that the central positive source has a\nstrength of \u000fp rather than 1 and the negative sources each\nhave strength \u2212\u000fn instead of \u22121. The position of the null\npoint out of the plane on the z-axis is then given by:\nBz(0; 0; z) =\n\u000fp\nz2\n\u2212 3\u000fnz\n(1 + z2)3=2\n= 0; (7)\nD. S. Brown and E. R.

Three-dimensional \feld line plot showing a particular\nCoronal-Null state { an asymmetric topological state generated\nby sources at (0; 0), (0; 1), (\u22120:7;\u22120:6) and (0:9;\u22120:4) with\nrespective strengths 1:5, \u22120:9, \u22120:8 and \u22121:1 and a null out\nof the z = 0 plane. The solid lines show the fan \feld lines, the\nthick lines show the spine \feld lines, the dashed lines represent\nseparators, the asterisks are sources and the dots are null points\nwhich can be rearranged to give\nz = \u0006 1\u0012\u0010\n3\u000fn\n\u000fp\n\u00112=3\n\u2212 1\n\u00131=2 \u0001 (8)\nThis has the property that z \u2212! 1 as \u000fp \u2212! 3\u000fn from\nbelow. Thus, as the sum of the sources tends to zero, the\nnull point out of the z = 0 plane moves out to in\fnity.\nWhen \u000fp=\u000fn exceeds 3 the null point out of the plane no\nlonger exists (since solutions to Eq. (8) are complex) and\nsome of the \feld lines from the positive source open out.\nThis could occur by negative flux interacting and being\ncancelled by external positive flux.\n2.3. Bifurcation behaviour\nIn the previous example, it was possible to calculate the\nnull points analytically due to the three-fold degree of\nsymmetry. Nevertheless, one has to be careful in making\ngeneral deductions from symmetric systems since many\nsuch examples can possess topologically unstable non-\ngeneric behaviour (Brown & Priest 2000). However, the\ntopology of this con\fguration, with its null out of the\nplane is structurally stable and so does continue to ex-\nist when the system is perturbed and the symmetry is\nbroken. An example of this is given in Fig. 6.\nFigure 7 shows where the topological state with a null\nout of the plane (henceforth referred to as the Coronal-\nNull state or CN state for short) exists in parameter space.\nThe negative sources in Fig. 6 are \fxed and the position\nof the positive source is varied. Eventually, the coronal-\nnull state bifurcates into the so called double-intersecting-\ndetached state shown in Fig. 2, in which there are two\nseparators, one separatrix dome and two separatrix walls.\nTo understand how this bifurcation occurs, the be-\nhaviour of the null points must be analysed. The paths of\nthe null points as the positive source is moved are shown in\nFig. 8. The initial con\fguration is the one shown in Fig. 6\nFig. 7. Bifurcation diagram showing the region in parameter\nspace where there is a null point out of the plane. The hor-\nizontal and vertical axes represent the locations of a positive\nsource of strength 1:5. Fixed negative sources are located at\n(0; 1), (\u22120:7;\u22120:6) and (0:9;\u22120:4) with strengths \u22120:9, \u22120:8\nand \u22121:1. The topological states are (CN) coronal-null state,\n(2ID) double-intersecting-detached state\nFig. 8. Plot showing the evolution of the null points as the\ntopology bifurcates between the coronal-null state and the\ndouble-intersecting-detached state. The large dots indicate\nthe initial position of the nulls. The path of the varying source\nis indicated by a dashed line\nand, as the positive source is moved along the dashed line,\nthe nulls move along the solid curves.\nThe null which is out of the z = 0 plane can be seen to\napproach the plane and merge with one of the null points\nalready in the plane. This behaviour seems strange at \frst,\nuntil one remembers that the behaviour in the unphysical\nregion below the z = 0 plane is the mirror image of the\nbehaviour above the plane. Thus, there is also a null point\nbelow the plane which approaches the plane and merges\nwith the null in the plane and the one that approaches\nfrom above at the same time.\nIn other words, the three nulls merge to form a third-\norder null point at the moment of bifurcation. Two of the\nsolutions then become complex and the third-order null\nbecomes a \frst-order null (part of the double-intersecting-\ndetached state). This is a three-dimensional version of a\n344 D. S. Brown and E. R. Priest: Null points in the corona\npitchfork bifurcation, which is referred to here as a local\ndouble-separator bifurcation.\nPreviously (for example Brown & Priest 1999a), lo-\ncal bifurcations of the magnetic \feld have involved\nthe appearance of a second-order null which splits into\ntwo \frst-order nulls, or the reverse process where two\n\frst-order nulls coalesce to form a second-order null which\nis annihilated. In both cases the second-order null only ex-\nists for critical values of the parameters, and is therefore\ntopologically unstable (as small perturbations of the pa-\nrameters will cause it either to disappear or to spilt into\ntwo \frst-order nulls).\nPitchfork-type bifurcations of the magnetic \feld have\nbeen demonstrated by Priest et al. (1997) with three\nsources. However, their example only occurs between topo-\nlogically unstable three-source states which have high\nsymmetry and is a non-generic example. Also, the three\nnull points involved in their bifurcation remain in the\nz = 0 plane at all times.\n2.4. Analytical model for local double-separator\nbifurcation\nAn analytical model for the magnetic \feld of this process\ncan be described by the equation\nB(r) =\n0@ \u2212x (3z2 + \u0015+ a\u0001(2\u0015+ a)y\nz\n(\nz2 \u2212 \u0015\u0001\n1A ; (9)\nwhere \u0015 is the parameter to be varied and a is a constant\nwhich is \fxed so that \u0015 + a > 0 and 2\u0015+ a > 0 near the\nbifurcation point (\u0015 = 0).\nEquation (9) has null points where x = y = 0 and\nz = 0 or z = \u0006p\u0015. When \u0015 < 0 the system has two com-\nplex roots and the only physical null point is at (0; 0; 0).\nWhen \u0015 = 0 the system has a triple root at (0; 0; 0) which\nis a third-order null point. As \u0015 increases, the third-order\nnull splits into three \frst-order nulls, as shown in Fig. 9.\nBefore bifurcation the single null point has an asso-\nciated separatrix surface. At bifurcation, this actually be-\ncomes two di\u000berent surfaces in the plane x = 0 that meet\nalong the line x = z = 0 (which becomes a spine \feld line).\nAs the nulls split, a new separatrix surface is formed be-\ntween the spines of the two nulls that leave the z = 0\nplane (Fig. 9). This surface is perpendicular to the other\ntwo separatrix surfaces.\n3. Simulated magnetograms for coronal nulls\nThis paper has examined lower-order cases that produce\ncoronal nulls utilising point sources. However, the flux sur-\nface seen in magnetograms, taken by instruments such as\nSOHO\/MDI, are more complex than this, so what type of\ncon\fgurations in a magnetogram would give rise to nulls\nin the corona? Antiochos (1998) discuss a possible the-\noretical setup where a negative flux patch is completely\nsurrounded by positive flux. This possesses a coronal null\nabove the negative flux patch.\nFig. 9. Plots illustrating a local-double-separator bifurcation.\nThe \feld initially has one null point with a separatrix surface.\nAt bifurcation this null becomes a third-order null and splits\ninto three \frst-order nulls, which give birth to two new sepa-\nratrix surfaces and the corresponding spines\nFigure 10 shows contour plots of Bz for the coronal-\nnull state and the double intersecting-detached state.\nThese plots are used to simulate how magnetogram data\nfor these con\fgurations might appear. The plots are taken\nat a height z = 0:1 so that Bz has a non-zero component\nalmost everywhere (small perturbations of this height do\nnot change the qualitative nature of the \feld, so long as\nit does not approach or exceed the height of the coronal\nnull).\nThese cases are quite simple representations of what\nhappens in the solar corona and photosphere and a more\ncomplex example is shown in Fig. 11 along with the topo-\nlogical skeleton it produces. This is more akin to the type\nof magnetogram observable when a small bipole emerges\nbetween a larger bipole (such as those observed by Wang\n& Wang 1996; Filippov 1999; Aulanier et al. 2000), and\none of the smaller flux patches interacts and embeds itself\nwithin a larger patch. For this case, the total flux is bal-\nanced (although the small bipole and the large bipole are\nindividually unbalanced) and the coronal null is located\nD. S. Brown and E. R. Priest: Null points in the corona 345\nFig. 10. Contour plots of the magnetic \feld in the z-direction,\nBz at a height z = 0:1, for (top) the coronal-null state in\nFig. 6. and (bottom) the double-intersecting-detached state,\nwhere the positive null has been perturbed to the position (0:7;\n0:5). The dashed curves are negative contours, the solid curves\nare positive contours and the thick curve is the polarity inver-\nsion line. The plusses and asterisks show the xy-positions of\nthe positive and negative sources\nabove the positive source which is embedded within the\nring of negative sources. There are nine separators con-\nnecting the coronal null to nulls in the z = 0 plane and\nthese lie on a separatrix dome which incorporates the ring\nof negative sources and their associated nulls and encloses\nthe small positive source completely.\n4. Conclusions and discussion\nTo be able to understand coronal phenomena, it is im-\nportant to develop a theory for magnetic topology of the\ncorona. As the solar magnetic \feld is extremely complex,\nit is vital to study local structures, such as the one that\nFig. 11. (Top) Contour plot of the magnetic \feld in the z-\ndirection, Bz at a height z = 0:1, for a complex thirteen source\ncase where a coronal null exists. (Bottom) The skeleton of this\ntopology showing where the coronal null lies\nhas been described in this paper, in order to be able to\ncomprehend the global \feld in which it may be embed-\nded. Coronal nulls may be a vital topological feature for\nreconnective events and so it is necessary to understand\nhow they are born and the magnetic \feld evolves.\nResearchers such as Inverarity & Priest (1999) have\ndemonstrated the theoretical existence of stable coronal\nnulls, but have not discussed in detail the mechanisms\nwhich cause them to be born through a bifurcation. When\na source of one polarity (say, positive) is surrounded by\nsources of the opposite polarity (say, negative), and the\nsum of the negative sources locally outweighs the strength\nof the positive source, then a null point will be present in\nthe region z > 0. This paper has illustrated such behaviour\nwith three surrounding sources, but, it is expected to hold\nalso with four or more sources or as part of a more complex\ntopology (such as in Fig. 11).\nSuch a coronal null is connected to the other nulls in\nthe z = 0 plane by separators. These separators would\nprobably play an important role in a more dynamic sit-\nuation since they are regions where current ribbons can\nform and reconnection can take place (Longcope & Cowley\n1996). Adding more negative sources to the surrounding\nring would create more null points in the z = 0 plane\nwhich could be connected to the coronal null by a sepa-\nrator. The example shown in Fig. 11 has eight null points\nin the z = 0 plane which are all connected to the coronal\n346 D. S. Brown and E. R. Priest: Null points in the corona\nnull by separators. This provides plenty of locations for\nreconnection to take place.\nIt has also been demonstrated how a coronal null can\nbifurcate out of or back into the z = 0 plane. At a critical\nsource con\fguration, a linear null lying in the z = 0 plane\nbecomes a third-order null, which splits into three linear\nnulls, one of which stays in the z = 0 plane, one rises into\nthe region z > 0 and the third moves into the unphysical\nregion z < 0. This is known as a local double-separator bi-\nfurcation, which is a three-dimensional version of a pitch-\nfork bifurcation. Previous local bifurcations of the mag-\nnetic \feld have involved the appearance of second-order\nnulls which split into two \frst-order nulls (or the reverse\nprocess) (Brown & Priest 1999a). An example of the ap-\npearance of a third-order null was given by Priest et al.\n(1997), but this was a non-generic case due to the sym-\nmetry of the system, where a second-order null appeared\nat the same location as an existing \frst-order null.\nVarying the relative strength of the flux sources causes\nthe null point to rise and lower in the z-direction. As the\nsources approach flux balance, the null point moves out\nto in\fnity. Such a mechanism causes closed \feld lines to\nopen in response to a \fnite motion of the sources and may\nbe the basis of a flux break-out model for solar flares and\nother eruptions (Bungey 1995; Antiochos 1998; Antiochos\net al. 1999). The idea of having topological triggers for\ncon\fned flares rather than eruptions has been previously\nsuggested by Lau (1993) and Gorbachev et al. (1988).\nFurthermore, the flux con\fguration of a magnetic frag-\nment being surrounded by fragments of opposite polarity\nhas been observed by D\u0013emoulin et al. (1994); Filippov\n(1999); Aulanier et al. (2000) in photospheric magne-\ntograms, and their coronal magnetic structures (whether\ncomputed or sketched) were related to a coronal null. Also\nFletcher et al. (2000) have recently proposed a model us-\ning a topological structure of this form and demonstrated\nthat \feld lines may reconnect through the coronal null\nwhen flux cancellation (or emergence) occurs.\nThe presence of a coronal null may then form a basis\nfor an explanation of why regions with so-called parasitic\npolarities or delta spots (e.g., Zirin 1988) are likely to\nproduce flares.\nAcknowledgements.
