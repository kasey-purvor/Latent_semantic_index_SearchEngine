Introduction\n[2] Since the discovery of the plasmapause by Carpenter\n[1963] and Gringauz [1963] the dynamic plasmasphere -\nplasmapause - plasmatrough system has been extensively\nmonitored using both ground-based and satellite techniques.\nThe dynamics of mass loss and injection processes are\nnot fully understood, in fact the Imager for Magnetopause-\nto-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) mission is dedicat-\ned to better understanding these issues. However, the\naverage position of the plasmapause can be described\nby empirical models, for example Orr and Webb [1975]\nand Carpenter and Anderson [1992]. The majority of\nthese previous studies have investigated electron number\ndensity, and so the behaviour of the ion populations are less\nwell understood.\n[3] This letter presents the first coordinated IMAGE\nsatellite and multi-instrument ground-based study of the\nplasmasphere. Observational results from ground-based\nmagnetometers, VLF receivers, the IMAGE RPI (Radio\nPlasma Imager) and EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Imager),\nand plasma mass densities calculated along flux tubes by\nSUPIM (Sheffield University Plasmasphere Ionosphere\nModel) [e.g., Bailey and Sellek, 1990] are compared. In a\nsimilar plasmatrough study Loto\u2019aniu et al. [1999] compared\nground-based magnetometer derived plasma mass densities\nto in-situ electron densities measured by the CRRES satellite.\n[4] By assuming a hydrogen plasma, electron number\ndensities (e.g., from the VLF measurements or IMAGE\nRPI instrument) can be directly converted to plasma mass\ndensities. When these are compared to mass density esti-\nmates including heavy ions (e.g., those derived from ground-\nbased magnetometer data or the SUPIM model) this allows\ninferences to be made about the presence of heavy ions.\n[5] Individual techniques cannot provide plasma densi-\nties at all local times or L-shells. Currently, the best single-\ninstrument view of the plasmasphere comes from the EUV\nimager on the IMAGE satellite [Sandel et al., 2000]. This\nroutinely produces remote-sensing images of the helium\nportion of the plasmasphere, with spatial and temporal\nresolutions of 0.1 RE and \u000110 minutes respectively, in\n2-D line-of-sight integrated pictures. Therefore, coordinated\nmulti-instrument observations of a particular plasma popu-\nlation, recorded at different L-shells and\/or local times, can\noffer a unique view of plasma dynamics currently unavail-\nable using a single instrument alone.\n2. Method and Results\n[6] We present observations from 19th August 2000, a\ngeomagnetically quiet day with Kp < 2 during which the\nmagnetosphere was recovering from a Kp = 8\u0002 storm which\noccurred seven days previously.\n[7] The cross-phase technique compares amplitude and\nphase spectra, in the ULF range, from latitudinally separated\nground-based magnetometer pairs to produce an estimate of\nthe local field line resonant frequency of the field-line whose\nfootprint lies approximately mid-way between the two sta-\ntions [e.g., Waters et al., 1996; Menk et al., 1999]. As this\nfrequency depends upon the field line length, the ambient\nmagnetic field strength, and the plasma density along the\nfield line, it can be used to obtain an estimate of the equatorial\nplane plasma mass density [e.g.,Menk et al., 1999]. This was\nachieved by numerically solving the standing toroidal Alfve\u00b4n\nwave equation in dipole coordinates, derived by Radoski\n[1967]; and assuming a radial density distribution \u0001r\u00023.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 30, NO. 12, 1600, doi:10.1029\/2003GL016946, 2003\n1Department of Physics, University of York, Heslington, York, UK.\n2School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and CRC for Satellite\nSystems, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, Texas, USA.\n4Space and Atmosphere Research Group, Department of Applied\nMathematics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.\n5British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n6Now at Dept. of Physics, University of Alberta, Canada.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/03\/2003GL016946$05.00\n2 - 1\n[8] Data from eight selected stations of the combined\nSAMNET (U.K. Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network) and\nBGS (British Geological Survey) magnetometer array and\nfour stations of the IMAGE (International Monitor for\nAuroral Geomagnetic Effects) array in northern Europe\nhave been used to produce ten plasma density estimates\nbetween L = 2.66 and L = 5.85 from 0625\u20130750 UT\n(approximately 0704\u20130858 LT). One of the magnetometer\nstations (Thurso, 58.36\u0001N, 3.69\u0001W, L = 3.30) was tempo-\nrarily deployed as part of the SAMNET array between 18\u2013\n21st August 2000. The location of these stations are shown\nas solid squares in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the cross-phase\nderived mass densities for this interval. Associated error-\nbars plotted in Figure 2 relate to uncertainty in identifying\nfield line resonant frequencies using the cross-phase tech-\nnique, and are typically \u000125\u201330%. Other less significant\nuncertainties are due to assumptions of a toroidal mode\nwave and the r\u00023 density dependence assumed in calculat-\ning the mass density for the observed resonant frequency.\nThese have not been included in the cross-phase error-bars\nshown in Figure 2.\n[9] The RPI instrument on board the elliptically orbiting\nIMAGE satellite is able to passively measure the ambient\nelectric field in order to determine the local plasma fre-\nquency, and thus the in-situ electron density [e.g., Reinisch\net al., 2000; Goldstein et al., 2003]. Data from two orbits\nare presented. The first pass (orbit 1 in Figure 2), between\n0615\u20130812 UT (\u00010300 MLT), spanned L-shells between\n8.10 and 2.45 and latitudes between 34\u0001N and 19\u0001S. The\nsecond pass (orbit 2 in Figure 2) was from 1928\u20132214 UT\n(\u00010300 MLT) and spanned L-shells between 3.20 and 7.97\nand latitudes between 24\u0001N and 25\u0001S. The northern hemi-\nsphere geomagnetic field ground footprints of the IMAGE\nsatellite during these two intervals are plotted in Figure 1\nusing the Tsyganenko 89 magnetic field model (from\nSSCWeb at http:\/\/www.sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov).\n[10] Recent observations have suggested that field-aligned\ndensity profiles at high altitudes may be almost constant\n[Goldstein et al., 2001]. Hence the\u0003 and + symbols in Figure\n2 represent the expected equatorial electron density if the\nlocal field-aligned density variation is constant. However,\nprevious studies have also suggested steeper plasma density\nvariations along the field line.Warner and Orr [1979] stated\nthat a plasma density variation of r\u00023 is approprite for the\nplasmasphere. Poulter et al. [1984] calculated that varying\nthe assumed density variation between r\u00023 and r\u00025 would\nalter the deduced density by less than \u00b19%. The size of the\nerror bars in Figure 2 shows the difference between the\nequatorial plane electron number densities if constant and r\u00023\nmapping of RPI densities to the equatorial plane are assumed.\nThe implicit error associated with identifying the in-situ\nIMAGE RPI electron densities relates to the uncertainty in\nmanually determining the electron plasma frequencies.\nThis error is assumed to be 12% on average; however, this\nerror is not indicated explicitly in Figure 2.\n[11] VLF (Very Low Frequency) signals received at two\nlocations have also been used to calculate equatorial plane\nelectron number densities (filled diamond symbols in\nFigure 1). Doppler whistler-mode signals from the NLK\ntransmitter (48.2\u0001N, 121.9\u0001W; open diamond in Figure 1)\nwere received at Dunedin, New Zealand (46\u0001S, 171\u0001E) and\ntypically propagate along ducts situated between L= 2.0\u20132.5\nat the geographic longitude \u0001162\u0001W (first dashed line in\nFigure 1). The delay times used to calculate the equatorial\nplane electron density were measured at 1000 UT (0000 LT),\nsee Clilverd et al. [1991] for more details. Also, natural\nlightning-generated whistlers were received at Halley (76\u0001S,\n26\u0001W) between 0400\u20130730 UT (0100\u20130430 LT). These are\nassumed to be generated in the east-coast region of the USA,\nand propagate at an assumed longitude of \u000140\u0001W (second\ndashed line in Figure 1). Eight equatorial plane electron\ndensities in the region of L = 4 were calculated using the Park\ndiffusive equilibrium model no. 1 [Park, 1982] from the Ho\nand Bernard [1973] 3-point whistler scaling method. The\nerror associated with the VLF-derived electron densities is\nassumed to be 10% [Ho and Bernard, 1973].\n[12] Mass densities have also been calculated using the\nSUPIM model. SUPIM is an ab-initio model which assumes\na dipolar geomagnetic field and solves time dependent\nequations of continuity, momentum and energy balance to\nproduce estimates of O+, H+, He+ and e\u0002 density along a\nclosed plasmaspheric flux tube as a function of local time\nfor a particular day. Actual values of Ap and f10.7 are used\nas inputs for the model. The individual ion densities in the\nequatorial plane were summed to provide an overall plasma\nFigure 1.

Discussion\n[14] In Figure 3 the first IMAGE orbit profile shows a\ngradual decrease in density with L-shell from L \u0001 2.45 to\nL \u0001 4, beyond which density decreases more rapidly, by\nover two orders of magnitude across 2 RE, before again\ndecreasing with L at a gradual rate to L = 8.10. The second\nIMAGE orbit profile shows an extended plasmasphere to\nL \u0001 6 where a sharp decrease of density indicates a typical\nplasmapause. Beyond L \u0001 6 in the plasmatrough the density\ncontinues to decrease gradually with increasing L-shell.\nThese profiles can be compared to Figure 1 of Carpenter\nand Anderson [1992]. The IMAGE orbit 1 profile is similar\nto refilling profiles whereas the IMAGE orbit 2 profile is\nsimilar to a recently depleted plasmasphere profile, albeit at a\nvery high L-shell. The presence of these two profiles on the\nsame day suggests that azimuthal structure is present in the\ndensity distribution in the quiet-time outer plasmasphere.\n[15] The Kp-driven empirical model for local-time de-\npendent plasmapause position given by Orr and Webb\n[1975] locates the plasmapause at L = 5.44 \u00b1 0.4 at 0800\nLT (= UT) on this day; in fairly good agreement with the\nobserved results in Figure 3. The predicted plasmapause\nposition appropriate to the RPI density profile for IMAGE\norbit 1 is 0.1 RE inward of this. Hence the differences\nbetween the ground-based cross-phase profile (0600\u2013\n0800 LT) and the first IMAGE pass (0300 LT) cannot be\nexplained by LT differences in model plasmapause location\nbut are indicative of an azimuthally localised density\ndepletion in the outer plasmasphere which is local to\nIMAGE during orbit 1.\n[16] The cross-phase derived plasma mass density profile\nshows a gradual decrease with L-shell at typical plasma-\nspheric densities (\u00011000 amu\/cc), and is in agreement with\nthe plasmaspheric part of the IMAGE orbit 2 profile. The\nVLF derived plasma densities also show a typical plasma-\nsphere profile, in good agreement with those profiles\nderived from the cross-phase technique and from the RPI\ninstrument during IMAGE orbit 2.\n[17] The plasmaspheric plasma density profile calculated\nby the SUPIM model, shown in Figure 3, agrees well with\nthose derived from the three observational techniques, thus\nvalidating all of these techniques during a quiet interval.\nHowever, local time variation offered by SUPIM (not\nshown) does not explain the different plasma density profile\nobserved during IMAGE orbit 1.\n[18] Figure 4 (top panel) shows the IMAGE EUV equa-\ntorial intensity of 30.4 nm ultraviolet light. In this plot, each\npixel of the 1030 UT raw EUV image has been mapped to the\nmagnetic equatorial plane assuming a dipole field, as de-\nscribed for single points inGoldstein et al. [2003]. The sun is\nto the right, in the direction of the white arrow; and radial\ndistance in the equatorial plane is shown by the concentric\ncircles, each separated by 1 RE. Significant azimuthal struc-\nture is apparent, particularly in the nightside, consistent with\ndiffering RPI density profiles between orbits 1 and 2; this\nstructure being observed to co-rotate in subsequent EUV\nimages (not shown). Squares show the location of the in-situ\nRPI measurements for orbit 1, and circles show the locations\nof these plasma elements in the 1030 UT EUV image,\nassuming co-rotation. The bottom panel shows He+ column\nabundance (circles), calculated from EUV pixel intensity and\nthe observed solar flux at 30.4 nm. Also plotted is the\nelectron column abundance, (solid line) calculated from the\nobserved RPI orbit 1 density data as shown in Figure 3,\nassuming constant density along magnetic field lines. Aside\nfrom the scale factor of 40 there is excellent agreement\nbetween the RPI and EUV column density profiles, veri-\nFigure 3.

The agreement\nbetween the ground-based density profiles and RPI orbit\n2 (Figure 3) suggests a more azimuthally uniform plasma-\nsphere might be present later following a more extended\nperiod of refilling. The EUV intensity versus L profile for\n1030 UT and 0730 LT (not shown), appropriate to the VLF\nmeasurements in Figure 3, suggest that higher densities\nmay persist to at least L = 4.8 (the edge of the EUV field\nof view for this LT). This is consistent with ground\nmeasurements of a more extended plasmasphere at later\nlocal times.\n[19] To examine the presence of heavy ions in the\nplasmasphere we have compared the IMAGE orbit 1 RPI\nand cross-phase derived plasma densities observed at sim-\nilar L-shells (within 0.2 RE). Assuming all heavy ions are of\none species, the inferred number density is 35\u201364% He+ or\n7\u201313% O+ for L < 3.45. Beyond L = 3.45 the observed\ndensities from the two techniques agree within the limit of\nthe errors, suggesting relatively few heavy ions in the outer\nplasmasphere. This general trend agrees with that of Craven\net al. [1997], who observed a decrease in He+ to H+ ratio\nwith increasing radial distance in the plasmasphere. The\npercent number density of He+ calculated by SUPIM\nincreases from 2.9% at L = 2.57 to 6.5% at L = 6.02, whilst\nthe percent number density of O+ is negligible. This may\nexplain the slightly lower SUPIM profile as compared with\nthe cross-phase derived profile at low L-shells in Figure 3.\n4. Conclusions\n[20] A multi-instrument study of quiet-time magneto-\nspheric cold plasma densities has been presented. Using\ndata collected on 19th August 2000 by the IMAGE RPI\ninstrument, ground-based VLF receivers and ground-based\nmagnetometers, equatorial plane plasma mass density pro-\nfiles in the plasmasphere have been derived. These profiles\nwere compared to each other and also to that calculated by\nthe SUPIM model. Excellent agreement was obtained,\nvalidating the cross-phase technique for monitoring plasma-\nspheric density profiles during quiet times. Comparison of\nplasma density profiles suggested that few heavy ions were\npresent beyond L = 3.45.\n[21] Beyond L \u0001 4 the two profiles presented for the two\nIMAGE satellite passes on 19th August 2000 disagree,\nsuggesting azimuthal structure in the outer plasmasphere.\nIMAGE EUV images verify the gradual plasmapause ob-\nserved by RPI during orbit 1; quiet-time plasmaspheric\nazimuthal structure seen in the EUV images being consis-\ntent with the in-situ RPI observations differing from orbit to\norbit, and with the observations of Moldwin et al. [1995]\nand Carpenter and Lemaire [1997]. Our study illustrates the\nbenefits of using multiple instruments as a means to identify\nsmaller-scale plasma density structures. In the future, multi-\ninstrument studies can be used to monitor geomagnetic\nstorm-time plasmaspheric depletion and refilling processes,\nand to examine the role of heavy ions during these times.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
