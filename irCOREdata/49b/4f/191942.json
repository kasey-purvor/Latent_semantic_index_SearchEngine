Recent \nevidence suggests that temperature-dependent changes in presynaptic mechanisms remain \nin overall equilibrium and have little effect on transmitter release at low transmission \nfrequencies (Kushmerick et al., 2006). Our objective is to examine the postsynaptic \neffects of temperature. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from principle neurons in the \nmedial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) showed that a rise from 25\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C \nincreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) amplitude from -33\u00b12.3 to -46\u00b15.7pA (n=6) and \naccelerated mEPSC kinetics. Evoked EPSC amplitude increased from -3.14\u00b10.59 to -\n4.15\u00b10.73 nA with the fast decay time constant accelerating from 0.75\u00b10.09 ms at 25 oC \nto 0.56\u00b10.08 ms at 35oC.  Direct glutamate application produced currents which similarly \nincreased in amplitude from -0.76\u00b10.10nA at 25\u00b0C to -1.11\u00b10.19nA 35\u00b0C.  Kinetic \nmodelling of fast AMPA receptors showed that a temperature-dependent scaling of all \nreaction rate-constants by a single multiplicative factor (Q10=2.4) drives AMPA channels \nwith multiple subconductances into the higher-conducting states at higher temperature. \nFurthermore, Monte Carlo simulation and deconvolution analysis of transmission at the \ncalyx showed that this acceleration of the receptor kinetics explained both the mEPSC \nand evoked EPSC temperature-dependence. We propose that acceleration in postsynaptic \n2 \nAMPA receptor kinetics, rather than altered presynaptic release, is the primary \nmechanism by which temperature changes alter synaptic responses at low frequencies.\n3 \nIntroduction. \n \nFrom a physiological perspective, control of mammalian body temperature in the \nrange of 37-38oC is crucial for normal brain activity, with function becoming seriously \nimpaired during hypothermia when core temperature drops below 32\u00b0C (Kumar & Clark, \n2002).  Synaptic transmission in mammals is adapted to 37oC and extrapolation of data \nfrom low temperature studies is problematic due to its multifactorial nature (Micheva & \nSmith, 2005). Many in vitro studies are conducted at lower temperatures to aid tissue \nsurvival and improve voltage clamp of conductances with rapid kinetics. Characterization \nof the temperature dependence of synaptic transmission will allow closer comparison of \nin vitro and in vivo data and gives some insight into central mechanisms of hypothermia.   \nThe calyx of Held synapse onto MNTB neurons has become an important model \nof central synaptic transmission.  Located in the auditory pathway it contributes to sound \nsource localization (Grothe, 2003) involving interaural timing and level discrimination. \nIts large size and somatic location allow in vitro recording of fast AMPA receptor \nmediated glutamatergic EPSCs (Forsythe & Barnes-Davies, 1993b; Forsythe 1994; \nBarnes-Davies & Forsythe, 1995; Borst et al., 1995; Taschenberger & von Gersdorff, \n2000) and miniature events (mEPSCs) caused by the release of single quanta of \nglutamate (Sahara & Takahashi, 2001).   \nPresynaptic calyceal recordings show that raised temperature reduced presynaptic \naction potential (AP) amplitude and duration (Kushmerick et al., 2006) leading to \nreduced calcium influx (Borst & Sakmann, 1998). So although the readily-releasable pool \nsize and vesicle recycling rates are enhanced at physiological temperatures (Pyott & \nRosenmund, 2002) reducing short-term depression (Taschenberger & von Gersdorff, \n2000; Kushmerick et al., 2006), AP-induced transmitter release is slightly reduced (Pyott \n& Rosenmund, 2002) or unchanged during single EPSCs (Kushmerick et al., 2006). \nThere is evidence that temperature changes alter postsynaptic response (for example \nAsztely et al., 1997; Kidd & Isaac, 2001) but relatively little information is available \nfrom CNS synapses.  \n4 \nThe aim of the present study was to characterise the effect of temperature on \nsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) using spontaneous mEPSCs and evoked synaptic \ncurrents (EPSCs) at the calyx of Held. Computational modelling of AMPA-receptors was \nemployed to determine how temperature influenced mEPSCs. Monte Carlo techniques \nsimulating mEPSCs at different temperatures supported the hypothesis that acceleration \nof postsynaptic AMPAR reaction kinetics is the predominant factor in determining the \ntemperature sensitivity of synaptic transmission. The results demonstrate that the increase \nin synaptic strength with raised temperature is a postsynaptic mechanism due to opening \nof AMPA receptors to higher conducting states. \n \nMaterials and Methods. \n \nPreparation of Brain Slices. \nLister-Hooded rats (10 and 11 days old) were killed by decapitation in accordance \nwith the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) act 1986 and brainstem slices containing the \nsuperior olivary complex (SOC) prepared as previously described (Wong et al., 2003).  \nBriefly, 220 \u00b5m-thick transverse slices of SOC containing the MNTB were cut in a low-\nsodium artificial CSF (aCSF) at ~0\u00baC.  Slices were then maintained in a normal aCSF at \n37\u00baC for 1 hour, after which they were stored at room temperature.  Composition of the \nnormal aCSF was (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 \nsodium pyruvate, 3 myo-inositol, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 ascorbic acid.  The pH was 7.4 \nwhen bubbled with 95% O2\/95% CO2.  For the low sodium aCSF, NaCl was replaced \nwith 250 mM sucrose, and CaCl2 and MgCl2 concentrations were changed to 0.1 and 4 \nmM, respectively. \nElectrophysiology and imaging. \nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from MNTB neurons (visualized \nat 40X with a Zeiss Axioskop fitted with DIC optics) using a multiclamp 700B amplifier \n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and pCLAMP9 software (Molecular Devices, \nSunnyvale, CA), sampling at 50 kHz filtered at 10 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from \nborosilicate glass capillaries containing an internal filament (GC150F-7.5, outer diameter \n5 \n1.5 mm, inner diameter 0.86 mm; Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, UK) using a 2-stage \nvertical puller (PC-10 Narishige, Tokyo, Japan).  Pipettes had a final open-tip resistance \nof ~3.5 M\u2126 when filled with a solution containing (mM) 97.5 Kgluconate, 32.5 KCl, 10 \nHEPES, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 5 QX-314 (pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH).  Whole-cell \naccess resistances were <20 M\u2126 and series resistances were routinely compensated by \n70%.  EPSCs were evoked by stimulation with bipolar platinum electrode placed at the \nmidline across the slice and using a DS2A isolated stimulator (~8V, 0.2 ms; Digitimer, \nWelwyn Garden City, UK). \nSynaptic connections were detected using an imaging technique described \npreviously (Billups et al., 2002).  Briefly, cells were loaded with 7\u00b5M Fura2-AM \n(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for ~4 minutes and then viewed using a Photometrics \nCoolSNAP-fx camera after a single 100ms exposure to 380 nm (provided by a xenon arc \nlamp controlled by a Cairn Optoscan monochromater; Cairn Instruments, Faversham, \nUK).  The fluorescent image was displayed using Metafluor imaging software (version \n4.01, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and regions of interest were drawn around \nvisualized neurons.  A stimulus train was delivered (200Hz, 200ms) and synaptically \nconnected cells were identified by a decrease in the 380 nm signal brought about by the \npostsynaptic calcium rise.  These cells were then located and patched. \nRecordings were taken at specified temperatures between 25 and 38\u00b0C, the bath \ntemperature was feedback controlled by a Peltier device warming the aCSF passing \nthrough a rapid flow perfusion system.  A small volume (~800 \u00b5l) tissue bath was used to \nallow fast temperature equilibration, and a ceramic water-immersion objective coated \nwith sylgard was used to minimize local heat loss.  Regular calibration of temperature \nwas carried out, with the bath temperature stable within \u00b1 1\u00b0C. MNTB cells were voltage \nclamped at a holding potential of -60 mV. EPSCs were elicited at a frequency 0.2 Hz to \nminimise short term depression and where possible, temperature was varied while \nmaintaining patch recording from individual neurons so each cell acted as its own \ncontrol. mEPSCs were extracted from traces using the \u2018event detection\u2019 tool in pClamp9 \n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All drugs were applied by bath perfusion in the \n6 \naCSF.  Drugs used were tetrodotoxin (TTX; Latoxan, Rosans, France), DNQX and \nkynurenate (Tocris, UK). \nPressure applications of Glutamate. \nPuffing experiments were performed using a Picospritzer III (Intracel) connected \nto a 3.5 M\u2126 electrode filled with 5 mM glutamate in aCSF. The tip of the electrode was \nplaced near a patch clamped MNTB neuron and the maximal response to the agonist was \noptimized by mapping pipette positions. Pulses of 3 ms (10 PSI) were applied every 8 \nseconds in the presence of TTX and Kynurenate at 25oC or 35oC as indicated.  \nStatistics. \nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM or mean  \u00b1 SD and significance verified using \na two-tailed paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test on raw data, with a p value <0.05 \nbeing considered significant. \nModelling. \nGlutamate diffusion and binding to AMPARs at the calyx of Held was modelled \nusing \u2018MCell\u2019 version 2.76 (Stiles & Bartol, 2001, http:\/\/www.mcell.salk.edu\/) which \nemploys Monte Carlo algorithms to simulate the three-dimensional diffusion of \nindividual ligand molecules and allows for the inclusion of effector sites to simulate \nligand binding. All simulations were carried out with a time step of 1\u00b5s. The MCell code \nis available for download at ModelDB: \n(http:\/\/senselab.med.yale.edu\/senselab\/ModelDB\/default.asp; Revision note: the code will \nbe available upon publication - until then, it may be accessed at \nhttp:\/\/homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk\/mhennig\/Calyx\/). \nSynaptic Geometry    \nThe model consists of a single active zone (AZ) where glutamate is released from \na vesicle; its associated postsynaptic density (PSD) and neighbouring PSDs were \nincluded. The geometry of a calyceal AZ was constructed according to morphological \ndata given by S\u00e4tzler et al. (2002) (Fig. 3A). Quadratic sections of pre- and postsynaptic \nmembrane were separated by a cleft of 28nm. PSDs with an area of 0.1nm2 and separated \nby 317nm were populated with 80 AMPARs each. Glutamate was released from a single \nvesicle above the central PSD. The location of the vesicle relative to the PSD was \n7 \nvariable, and for a given set of simulations the location was assumed to be randomly \ndistributed above the area of the PSD in each trial (Franks et al., 2003). The case where \nthe vesicle was not constrained to the area above the PSD was also considered. \nA vesicle was modelled as a cube with a side length of 32nm, corresponding to a \nvolume of 3.3 10-23m3 (equivalent to a spherical vesicle with a diameter of 46nm as given \nby S\u00e4tzler et al. (2002), which was corrected for a membrane thickness of 6nm). The \nvesicle was connected to the synaptic cleft by a fusion pore, which was modelled as a box \nwith a height of 9nm (about 1.5 times the membrane thickness) and a variable \ndiameter (Stiles et al., 1996; Franks et al., 2003). At the beginning of a release, the fusion \npore was gradually opened according to dfp(t)=dmax (1-e-at), where t is the time in ms and \na=0.01ms -1. The diameter was taken dmax=9nm, and a value dmax=11nm was also \ninvestigated. \nTo reproduce the observed variability of mEPSCs (see Results; Franks et al., \n2003; Raghavachari & Lisman, 2004), the precise location of the vesicle was assumed to \nbe uniformly distributed over an area restricted to 200nm relative to the centre of this \nPSD. This was approximated by running multiple simulations of releases at six different \nradii (see Fig. 3A, top). To account for the higher probability of observing a release \nfurther away from the centre of the PSD (because the circumference of the circles defined \nby each radius increases with distance, and a release can occur at any location of this \ncircle), the number of individual releases at each radius contributing to the average \nmEPSC was then chosen such that a uniform coverage of the area was obtained. \nGlutamate Concentration and Diffusion \nThe glutamate content of the vesicle was adjusted such that the peak glutamate \nconcentration in the synaptic cleft did not exceed 1mM during a release (Clements et al., \n1992). The peak concentration was typically reached, depending on the diffusion \ncoefficient and fusion pore dynamics, at around 300-500\u00b5s after the beginning of the \nfusion process. The vesicle contained 6000 glutamate molecules, which corresponds to a \nvesicular concentration of 302 mM. The diffusion coefficient for glutamate was set to \nD=3 10-6cm2s-1, as it is likely to be lower than in aqueous solution (D=7.5 10-6cm2s-1 for \nglutamine; Longsworth, 1953) due to increased viscosity of the intracellular medium and \n8 \nadditional diffusion barriers (Rusakov & Kullmann, 1998). This value however was not \ncritical for the results shown here, as it was possible to obtain precise fits of the miniature \nevents with values in the range of D=2-6 10-6cm2s-1 by adjusting the rate constants of the \nAMPA receptor model accordingly. To constrain the value of D, the AMPAR rate \nconstants for channel opening and closing were initially set to the values reported by \nRobert & Howe (2003) for GLUR4 (see below), and then the diffusion coefficient was \nestimated which allowed for best fits to the experimental data. \nAMPAR Model    \nTo simulate postsynaptic AMPAR gating, a kinetic model of the GluR4 channel \nwas constructed based on earlier work by Robert & Howe (2003) as follows: \n \n--- insert kinetic scheme here --- \n \nThis model is based on the following experimental findings : \n1. AMPA receptors are tetramers (Rosenmund et al., 1998), each subunit binds one \nagonist molecule and from each of these closed bound states (C1-C4), a transition into an \nopen (O1-O4) or desensitised (D1-D4) state is possible (Armstrong & Gouaux, 2000; Sun \net al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003). Some earlier models assumed that desensitisation can also \noccur from bound states where channel opening is not possible (Vyklicky et al., 1991; \nRaman & Trussell, 1995; Robert & Howe, 2003). This may however result from the low \nconductance associated with this state (see below) that cannot be resolved in noisy \nrecordings (Clements et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2002). \n2. Agonist binding and unbinding is assumed to take place from closed and desensitised \nstates, with little or no contribution from open states (Armstrong & Gouaux, 2000). \nHence in this model receptor occupancy can change between closed and desensitised \nstates. \n3. The conductance of AMPA channels depends on the occupancy by agonist \nmolecules (Swanson et al., 1997; Rosenmund et al., 1998; Smith & Howe, 2000; Smith et \nal., 2000; Jin et al., 2003; Gebhardt & Cull-Candy, 2006). These experimental data \nsuggest that successive binding to the four AMPAR subunits affects the channel \n9 \nconductance and the data of Smith et al. (2000) suggests that high-conductance channels, \nsuch as those found at the calyx of Held (Sahara & Takahashi, 2001) have four clearly \nresolvable conductances. The respective conductances were set as fractions of the peak \nconductance at the fourfold bound state (O4; 0.1, 0.4 and 0.7).  All simulation parameters \nare summarised in Table 1 below. \n4. Glutamate binding was assumed to be cooperative, which is reflected by the increasing \nfactors for kB. This departure from the model by Robert & Howe (2003) was motivated \nby comparison of simulations with experimental data (see Results, Fig. 3). A cooperative \nbinding model was also proposed by Clements et al. (1998) and Raghavachari & \nLisman (2004). \n5. Assuming an acceleration of transition between different conformational states with \nincreased temperature, temperature dependency of the AMPAR kinetics was modelled by \nscaling the rate constants with a multiplicative factor. This assumption implies that all \nconformal changes in AMPARs may be accelerated uniformly with increased \ntemperature. Other combinations were also investigated. \n \nParameter Description Value \nkB Agonist binding rate 10 \u00b7 106M\u22121s\u22121 \nkU Agonist unbinding rate 8 \u00b7 103s\u22121 \nkO Channel opening rate 20 \u00b7 103s\u22121 \nkC Channel closing rate 10 \u00b7 103s\u22121 \nkD Desensitisation rate 4s\u22121 \nkR Resensitisation rate 15s\u22121 \ngi Channel conductances 6, 24, 42, 60pA \n \nTable 1:  Parameters for the kinetic AMPA receptor model.  \n \nAMPAR mediated currents    \nDuring the MCell simulations, the occurrences of all AMPAR reaction \nintermediates were counted at each iteration. The postsynaptic current was then generated \n10 \nby assigning each open state the respective conductance and by simulating voltage clamp \nat -60mV with a reversal potential of +7mV. All currents were, as in the experiments, \nfiltered at 10kHz. \nFitting mEPSCs    \n A combination of simulations with MCell and NEURON (Hines & Carnevale, \n1997) was used to produce the fits to the experimentally obtained miniature events. \n(Hines & Carnevale, 1997). The AMPA receptor model was implemented using \nNMODL (Hines & Carnevale, 2000) and AMPAR rate constants were optimised by least \nsquare fitting using the Praxis package. In this process, the rate constants for channel \nopening and closing were constrained to values close to those reported by Robert & \nHowe (2003) for GLUR4, which were experimentally estimated from open times and \nburst length distributions. A fit was first obtained for mEPSCs at 25\u00b0C and then a further \nfit to the same mEPSC at 35\u00b0C was achieved by fitting a single multiplicative factor. \n \nResults. \n \nTemperature effects on mEPSCs in the Calyx of Held. \nThe temperature dependence of postsynaptic AMPA receptors was assessed using \nspontaneous mEPSCs recorded from MNTB principle neurons at 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C in the \npresence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.5 \u00b5M) (Fig. 1A, B). Ten minutes were allowed for \nequilibration of temperature to the new value.  Mean amplitude, decay time-constants \n(single exponential) and frequencies of mEPSCs were calculated from averages of at least \n40 events at each temperature in each of 6 neurons.  In these cells, mEPSC mean \namplitudes  increased by 40\u00b114% (from -33 \u00b1 2.3 pA at 25\u00b0C to -46 \u00b1 5.7 pA at 35oC) \nand mean frequency increased by 440 \u00b1 175% (from 0.1 \u00b1 0.02 Hz at 25\u00b0 to 0.47 \u00b1 0.19 \nHz at 35oC).  The mEPSCs also had faster time-course at higher temperature; with 10-\n90% rise time and decay time constant (single exponential) decreasing by 15 \u00b1 8% (from \n0.25 \u00b1 0.02 ms at 25\u00b0C to 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 ms at 35oC) and 34 \u00b1 7% (from 0.51 \u00b1 0.06 ms at \n25\u00b0C to 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 ms at 35oC), respectively (Fig. 1B).  All changes in amplitude and \ndecay time constant were significant (p<0.05, paired t-test), however frequency \n11 \ndistributions were not Gaussian (p<0.05, Kolmogorov & Smirnov test) but a Wilcoxon \nsigned rank non-parametric test showed the increase in frequency with temperature was \nsignificant (p=0.0313). \nHistograms of mEPSC amplitudes were constructed for events in a single cell and \nacross the population of neurons (Fig. 1C).  The amplitude distributions were similar and \nshowed a rightward shift with increased temperature. Coefficients of variation (CV, after \nsubtraction of recording noise) were similar for both temperatures. At 25oC, the \nhistograms indicate some events smaller than -15 pA merging into noise, with fewer \nevents being lost at higher temperatures. Distributions for 10-90% rise time and decay \ntime constant significantly decreased with temperature (p<0.002, paired t-test; Fig 1D).  \nThere was a strong tendency towards increasing variance of both these parameters with \ndecreasing mEPSC amplitude, such that no apparent correlation existed between either \n10-90% rise time or decay time constant and mEPSC amplitude. \n \nSimulation of mEPSCs at 25oC \nMonte Carlo simulation of vesicular glutamate release, diffusion and AMPAR \ngating was used to model mEPSCs at the calyx of Held. The geometric layout of the \nsimulation is shown in Figure 2A and kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. A \nvesicle is placed above the presynaptic membrane and release is initiated by opening of a \npore that allows diffusion into the cleft. Diffusing glutamate binds to AMPA receptors \nembedded in the postsynaptic densities (PSDs). The model included five PSDs, and the \nvesicle was placed at random locations within a radius of 200nm relative to the central \nPSD (see Methods). Neighbouring PSDs were included to account for neurotransmitter \nspill-over (Neher & Sakaba, 2001), vesicle fusion never occurred at these locations.  \nWe first fitted the time course of average mEPSCs to the recordings from a single \ncell at 25\u00b0C (cell shown in Fig. 1B). To prevent over-fitting due to the large number of \nstates and transition rates in the kinetic scheme for AMPARs, the following constraints \nwere imposed on the model. First, the rates into and out of desensitisation were fixed \nsuch that a prolonged application of ligand molecules led to fast (see Fig. 3E) and near \ncomplete termination of the current (Sahara & Takahashi, 2001). Second, the channel \n12 \nopening and closing rates were fixed to those estimated Robert & Howe (2003) for \nGLUR4 subunits. This left the binding and unbinding rates between closed and \ndesensitised states as open parameters. Because mEPSCs are caused by rapid, short \nglutamate concentration transients, the effect of changing binding and unbinding rates \nbetween desensitised states had no influence on the response. Therefore, these rates were \nset equal to those for closed states. \nSimulated mEPSCs were averages from at least 155 individual realisations of a \nsingle release process. The comparison between an averaged simulated and recorded \nmEPSC shows that this model can produce a very accurate fit of the time course of a \ntypical mEPSC at the calyx of Held (Fig. 2B, bottom). The amplitude of the simulated \nmEPSC depends on the number of open channels, each weighted by the conductance \nstate assigned to its respective agonist occupancy (calculated by weighting each open \nchannel by its relative conductance level, compare Fig.2C, black and grey trace). \nConsistent with experimental data (Ishikawa et al., 2002), the AMPAR population (a total \nof 400 channels) during a single simulated vesicle is not saturated (Fig. 2C, dashed trace; \na total of about 80\/400 channels enter bound states, of these 40 channels are located in \nthe central PSD). Desensitisation occurs to approximately half of the available channels \nin the central PSD, and to about 20% of the channels in the neighbouring PSDs (Fig.2C, \ndotted line). \nExploiting Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we also investigated the variability \nof postsynaptic responses due to the stochasticity of diffusion and channel gating. The \npeak amplitude of individual mEPSCs is highly variable (range: -11pA to -69pA, CV: \n0.33, Fig. 2D), and is, as observed experimentally, strongly skewed (skewness: 0.71). The \ndistribution of 10%-90% rise and decay time constants closely matches the \nexperimentally observed values and dependence of variance on peak amplitude (Fig. 2E). \nThis indicates that the sources of variability included in these simulations (stochasticity \nof diffusion and ligand-receptor interactions and variable vesicle placement) can account \nfor almost all of the variability in experimental single cell data. \nIn addition, varying the number of receptors at each PSD (Gaussian distribution \nwith \u03c3=16 receptors) could fully reproduce the experimentally observed variability (CV: \n13 \n0.39, skewness: 1.1; not illustrated), as could keeping the number of receptors fixed  \nwhile not restricting vesicle location to the area above the PSD (CV: 0.38, skewness: 0.8; \nnot illustrated). \nCooperative binding and variable vesicle location can explain mEPSC variability \nAs suggested by the results above, variability in the vesicle location may be the origin of \nthe variability of mEPSCs recorded at the calyx of Held. The simulations show that the \nvesicle location relative to a PSD strongly influences the concentration of glutamate \n\u2018seen\u2019 by the AMPARs: moving the vesicle away from the centre of the PSD decreases \nthe concentration significantly while increasing the amount of spill-over glutamate to \nneighbouring PSDs (Fig. 3A). The spill-over glutamate concentration however peaks less \nrapidly compared to that at the central PSD (compare Fig. 3A, left and right panels), such \nthat the rising phase of a mEPSC mainly depends on the time course of the glutamate \nconcentration over the central PSD. \nVesicle location has a strong effect on the AMPA response, while the number of \nchannels with one or more bound glutamate molecules does not strongly depend on \nvesicle location (Fig. 3B). Release further from the PSD centre leads to fewer glutamate \nmolecules binding and receptor opening to lower conducting states (Fig. 3C). This gives \na substantial reduction (~66%) of the average current from a release 200nm away \ncompared to a central release (Fig. 3D) and can explain the variability of mEPSC peak \nresponses. Note that assuming a completely random vesicle location within a certain area \nmakes releases at or near the centre of a PSD less likely than in the periphery, which in \nturn increases the likelihood of small amplitude mEPSCs. This could be a simple \nexplanation for the strongly skewed amplitude histograms found experimentally (Fig. \n1C). \nThe effect of vesicle location strongly depends on cooperative binding of \nglutamate in the AMPAR model, and is responsible for the steep dose-response \nrelationship required for the variability caused by an approximately tenfold agonist \nconcentration difference (Fig. 3A).  Simulating AMPAR currents generated by a constant \nconcentration of glutamate shows that the peak amplitude varies more strongly for the \ncooperative binding model, compared to a model assuming independent binding (Fig. \n14 \n3E,F). In both cases, rate constants for binding and unbinding were adjusted to fit the \naverage mEPSC, subject to the constraints outlined above. It was noted that for the \nindependent model no alternatives could provide a similar fit while simultaneously \nproducing a steeper dose-response relationship. We also note that in the cooperative \nbinding model the 10%-90% rise time varied more strongly in the range 0.1-1mM (Fig. \n3E), which explains the good fit of the mEPSC rise time distribution (Fig. 2E) and is \nconsistent with experimental evidence obtained in CA1 pyramidal cells (Andrasfalvy & \nMagee, 2001). An independent binding model failed to reproduce the dependency of rise \nand decay time variability as a function of the mEPSC peak amplitude (data not shown).  \nWe propose, therefore, that in the context of the assumptions made here, a cooperative \nbinding model for AMPARs is necessary to explain the different aspects of mEPSC \nvariability at the calyx of Held.  \nAcceleration of AMPA receptor kinetics underlies temperature dependency of mEPSCs \nWe next used Monte Carlo simulations to distinguish between three plausible \nmechanisms that could contribute to the larger and faster synaptic responses at increased \ntemperature: 1. faster presynaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release 2. faster \nglutamate diffusion in the synaptic cleft or 3. accelerated molecular kinetics of \npostsynaptic AMPA receptors. \nA temperature-dependent acceleration of AMPAR reaction kinetics was the only \nmechanism required for successful reproduction of the experimental data. Starting from \nthe fit of mEPSCs at 25\u00b0C, a multiplication of all rate constants with a constant factor \n(Q10=2.4) was the only modification necessary to simulate faster mEPSCs with increased \namplitude and to fit the average mEPSC successfully at 35\u00b0C from the same \ncell (Fig. 4A-C). Again assuming a variable number of receptors at each PSD (see \nmethods) the response variability is comparable to the experimental results for a single \ncell (Fig. 4D, compare with Fig. 1C). Both rise and decay time distributions are similar to \nthose obtained experimentally and show the same trend of decreasing variability with \nincreasing mEPSC peak amplitude (Fig. 4E). \n \nAMPA receptors are driven into higher conducting states at physiological temperature \n15 \nThe kinetic AMPAR model was constructed to reflect the physical and physiological \nproperties of neuronal AMPA receptors, including multiple sub-conductance states. This \nlevel of detail allowed us to assess the influence of the increased rate constants with \ntemperature, and to refine and predict a more general model for temperature-related \nchanges in synaptic transmission. \nThe solid lines in the left panel of Figure 4F show the average number of open \nchannels during the mEPSC time course at 25oC and 35oC. The acceleration of receptor \nkinetics with temperature is indicated by the faster rise time of the grey (35\u00b0C) in \ncomparison with the black (25oC) traces. The associated relative conductance generated \nby the open channels is shown by the broken lines (open channels weighted by their \nrelative conductance level). The small magnitude of this conductance indicates that many \nreceptors are opening to low conductance states, so contributing little to the final current. \nAlthough the total number of open channels is little affected by temperature (solid \nlines Fig. 3D, both panels) the relative conductances (broken traces) differ substantially; \ni.e. the same number of receptors are open at both temperatures, but at 35\u00b0C a larger \nproportion are reaching a higher conductance state. This is clarified in the right panel of \nFigure 4D, where conductance traces were re-scaled to the peak of the absolute number \nof open channels at 35\u00b0C. Hence the larger proportion of AMPARs driven to high \nconductance states generates more current at higher temperatures, as shown by the larger \namplitude of the broken grey trace (35oC) in comparison to the broken black trace (25oC). \nThe larger current is a sole consequence of faster binding at high temperature, since \nreceptor affinity is unchanged and these open states are visited for shorter periods so \ngenerating rapid decays. Overall this suggests that at sub-physiological temperatures a \nsubstantial population of AMPARs bind glutamate but remain \u201csilent\u201d, contributing little \nto the postsynaptic current. Note that this conclusion is not only valid for the specific \nparameters set considered here, since any increase in kB (required to account for faster \nrise times at higher temperature) will lead to a higher probability of entering higher \nconductance states. \nThe model predicts that the average channel conductance of AMPARs should \nchange with temperature. This prediction was tested by investigating the relationship \n16 \nbetween the variance and mean of mEPSCs. For binomially distributed data, this relation \nis \u03c32=Nq2p(1-p), where \u03c32 is the variance, N the number of channels, q the mean channel \nconductance and p its open probability. Using the relation I=Npq, where I is the mean \ncurrent, we obtain \u03c32\/I=q(1-p). Hence, if we assume a constant p (i.e. unaltered affinity \nof the AMPARs), an increase of \u03c32\/I with temperature would indicate an increase in q. \nThis quantity can be measured directly for the experimental and simulated \nmEPSCs at the peak of the response. We did not pursue a full non-stationary variance-\nmean analysis (Sahara & Takahashi, 2001) because the simulations suggested that \nAMPARs desensitise during the course of a single mEPSC (see below) and therefore no \nreliable estimate of q may be obtainable. For the cell shown in Figure 3, we obtained \n\u03c3l\n2\/Il=6.53 10-12pA (25oC) and \u03c3h2\/Ih=7.28 10-12pA (35oC) giving a ratio \n(\u03c3h2Il)\/(\u03c3l2Ih)=1.23 (with the index l corresponding to 25\u00b0C, h to 35\u00b0C; variance due to \nrecording noise was subtracted).  The plausible explanation for this difference as \npredicted by the model, is that mean unitary conductance of single AMPAR channels has \nincreased with a rise in temperature. After pooling all mEPSCs recorded (389 events at \n25\u00b0C and 1502 events at 35\u00b0C; paired recordings from six cells), we found \u03c3l2\/Il=1.35 10-\n11pA, \u03c3h2\/Ih=1.69 10-11pA and a ratio (\u03c3h2Il)\/(\u03c3l2Ih)=1.25. For the simulated mEPSCs the \nratio was (\u03c3h2Il)\/(\u03c3l2\/Ih)=1.25 (\u03c3l2\/Il=2.65 10-12pA, \u03c3h2\/Ih=2.97 10-12pA) without and \n(\u03c3h2Il)\/(\u03c3l2\/Ih)=1.21 (\u03c3l2\/Il=4.53 10-12pA, \u03c3h2\/Ih=5.47 10-12pA) including variability in \nreceptor number.  \nHence in all three cases (single cell, pooled data and simulated responses) \u03c32\/I  \nincreased when temperature was raised, confirming an increased unitary conductance of \nthe AMPARs. Because not all sources of variability were considered, the absolute \nvariance in the simulations is slightly lower than that found in experimental recordings. \nNevertheless, the variance of the single cell data and the simulated responses is in the \nsame order of magnitude, indicating that the model contains the main sources of \nvariability. \nInfluence of glutamate diffusion and spill-over on simulated mEPSCs \nUsing the model, we next examined temperature-dependent influences on glutamate \nrelease, diffusion and spill-over. With the Q10 of diffusion ~1.3 in the synaptic cleft \n17 \n(Hille, 2001) only a small effect of temperature is expected. Temperature could also \naffect the vesicle fusion process, so to assess the influence of these parameters in the \nmodel, the diffusion coefficient was increased by a factor of 1.33, and the maximal width \nof the pore from 9 to 11 nm (with a corresponding increase of 1.25 in opening velocity).   \nIncreasing the diffusion coefficient leads to a slightly weaker glutamate transient, \nwhich decays faster, and this effect is also seen in the mEPSC (Fig. 5A). A widening of \nthe pore leads to a faster rise of the glutamate transient, which has a higher amplitude. \nAgain, this behaviour is also visible in the simulated mEPSC (Fig. 5A). Combining both \nmanipulations leads to a faster rise and decay, but also reduces the amplitude (Fig. 5A), \nwhich is not consistent with the experimental observation of faster rise and decay times \nand increased amplitude. Note also that all effects on the time course are much smaller \nthan those observed experimentally with temperature.  We therefore conclude that \ntemperature-dependent changes in diffusion or exocytosis cannot account for the \nobserved changes in experimental mEPSCs. \nFigure 5A also shows the glutamate spill-over transients at neighbouring PSDs, \nand the simulations suggest that the amplitude and rise of the spill-over transient is little \naffected by diffusion and exocytosis, while the decay shows a weak dependence on the \ndiffusion coefficient (note that spill-over transients will be stronger for releases not \ncentred above the PSD, see Fig. 3A); thus spill-over will contribute both to the response \nand desensitisation during a mEPSC. Comparing simulations where all PSDs were \npopulated with AMPARs with those with only the central PSD was populated shows that \nglutamate spill-over contributes to the peak and decay phase of mEPSCs (Fig. 5B, \ncompare solid and dashed traces). The relative influence of glutamate spill-over is similar \nat both 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C (Fig. 4C, compare solid and dashed traces) reflecting some \nchannel opening in neighbouring PSDs.  The number of open channels remains similar at \nboth temperatures however, further implying little temperature dependent spill-over (Fig. \n4F). \n In addition, spill-over leads to desensitisation of AMPARs at neighbouring \nPSDs (Fig. 5C). At higher temperatures more channels desensitise during a single \nmEPSC (Fig. 5C, compare black and grey traces), which results from an accelerated entry \n18 \ninto desensitised states.  The relative increase in the number of receptors entering \ndesensitised states on raising temperature is, however, substantially smaller for the sites \naffected by spill-over transmitter than for the central PSD (Fig. 5C, compare the two solid \nand dashed traces; note that a different scale applies to each pair). This suggests that at \nsub-physiological temperatures, the relative contribution of spill-over to desensitisation is \nstronger than at 37oC, as has been observed experimentally at the calyx of Held (Wong et \nal., 2003; Renden et al., 2005). \nEffects of Temperature on evoked EPSCs in the Calyx of Held. \nThe effect of changing temperature was measured on evoked EPSCs at a holding \npotential of -60 mV,  by electrical stimulation of the trapezoid body fibres.  Mean EPSC \namplitude, decay time constants (fitted with fast and slow exponentials), 10-90 % rise \ntimes and latency were calculated from averages of at least 10 events (evoked at 0.2 Hz).  \nTwo groups of recordings were obtained: data where the temperature was varied between \n25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C; or between 30\u00b0C and 38\u00b0C (allowing 10 minutes for the temperature to \nstabilise at the new value). Temperature changes caused considerable movement of the \ntissue, so multiple temperature changes in the same neuron were difficult to achieve \nroutinely; but data from two neurons included recordings from the full temperature range, \nas shown by the graphs in Figure 6B. It should be noted that in both of these cells, \ntemperature changes followed the sequence 30\u00b0C, 38\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C and down to 25\u00b0C, \nillustrating that the changes were reversible.  For each of the parameters (amplitude, fast \ndecay and latency) a linear trend was observed, similar to the averaged population data \nshown in Figure 6C (n= 6-9).  At 25\u00b0C mean EPSC amplitude was -3.14 \u00b1 0.59 nA, 10-\n90% rise time was 0.33 \u00b1 0.002 ms, fast decay time constant 0.75 \u00b1 0.09 ms, slow decay \ntime constant 6.39 \u00b1 0.85 ms (relative contribution = 15.3 \u00b1 2.0%)  with the EPSC having \na latency (measured from stimulus artefact to EPSC onset) of 1.2 \u00b1 0.21 ms (n=6).  On \nraising temperature to 35\u00b0C, EPSC amplitude increased by 34 \u00b1 2.7 % to -4.15 \u00b1 0.73 \nnA, 10-90 % rise time decreased by 23.1 \u00b1 5.5 % to 0.28 \u00b1 0.02 ms, fast decay time \nconstant accelerated by 26.5 \u00b1 3.0 % to 0.56 \u00b1 0.08 ms, slow time constant accelerated by \n24.0 \u00b1 4.0 % to 4.85 \u00b1 0.71 ms and latency decreased by 38.7 \u00b1 5.9 % to 0.73 \u00b1 0.07 ms.  \nAll changes were significant (p<0.01, n=6, paired t-test) and reversible upon returning to \n19 \n25\u00b0C.  Changing from 30\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C also caused reversible and significant changes in the \nEPSC: amplitude (increased by 33.3 \u00b1 12 % from -4.56 \u00b1 0.38 nA to -6.11 \u00b1 0.51 nA), \nfast time constant (decreased by 22 \u00b1 5.2% from 0.46 \u00b1 0.06 ms to 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 ms), 10-\n90 % rise time (decreased by 13.1 \u00b1 3.6 % from 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 ms to 0.23 \u00b1 0.02 ms) and \nlatency (decreased by 25.5 \u00b1 3.6 % from 0.81 \u00b1 0.15 ms to 0.62 \u00b1 0.15 ms; all p<0.05 \npaired t-test, n=6).  Slow decay time constant (representing 14.3 \u00b1 1.3 % of decay) \ndecreased by 13.8 \u00b1 4.4 % from 4.74 \u00b1 1.14 ms to 3.88 \u00b1 0.74 ms, but this was not \nsignificant (p>0.05 paired t-test). \nTemperature-dependent effects on glutamate-evoked currents. \nIn order to confirm the postsynaptic site of action, we tested the AMPAR \nresponse to applied glutamate at different temperatures in the same cells. Glutamate was \npressure ejected (5mM, 3 ms) using a picospritzer onto individual neurones and the \nresponses recorded at 25oC and 35oC, in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M TTX and 2 mM \nkynurenate, to block voltage-gated sodium channels, minimise extra-synaptic receptor \nactivation and AMPAR desensitization (Wong et al., 2003). Direct application of \nglutamate at 25oC gave a mean current of -0.76 \u00b1 0.10 nA, increasing to -1.11 \u00b1 0.19 nA \nat 35\u00b0C (Fig. 7; p<0.05, n=7 paired t-test).  The decay time constant (single exponential) \nof the responses evoked by a single glutamate puff accelerated from 38.7 \u00b1 4.3 ms at \n25\u00b0C to 25.4 \u00b1 2.4 ms at 35\u00b0C (Fig. 7; p<0.05paired t-test, n=7). These AMPAR currents \nwere blocked by bath application of 10 \u00b5M DNQX (n=3) and application of aCSF alone \ninduced no postsynaptic response (Fig. 7; n=3).  \n \nTemperature-dependent effects on evoked EPSCs are postsynaptic. \nA previous report demonstrated that temperature has little effect on quantal \ncontent of single evoked responses at the calyx of Held (Kushmerick et al., 2006). Our \nmodelling studies indicate that temperature-dependent changes in mEPSCs are due to \npostsynaptic effects on receptor kinetics. Using a simple deconvolution analysis to \nestimate the quantal content of evoked EPSCs (see e.g. Cohen et al., 1981; Borges et al., \n1995) we confirm that temperature change has little influence on quantal content.  \n20 \nThe deconvolution analysis was carried out using the averages of evoked \nresponses and mEPSCs at 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C (Fig. 8, upper graphs). The release rates \nobtained by deconvolution show a positive transient followed by negative undershoot \n(Fig. 8, lower graphs).  Negative release rates reflect the fact that the assumption of linear \nquantal summation is not sufficient for the calyx of Held, because desensitization and \nglutamate spillover both influence the late part of the response (Neher & Sakaba, 2001). \nThe release rates at both temperatures show great similarity (Fig. 8, lower traces) with \nboth cases exhibiting peak release rates of ~140 ms-1, and is qualitatively consistent with \nearlier estimates at room temperature (Borst & Sakmann, 1996; Meyer et al., 2001). As \nexpected, the release time course is slightly faster at 35\u00b0C, which may be a consequence \nof the faster presynatic Ca2+ currents at increased temperature (Helmchen et al., 1997; \nBorst & Sakmann, 1998). \nIn conclusion, our combined experimental and modelling studies show that \ntemperature-dependent changes in single evoked EPSCs are predominantly mediated by a \npostsynaptic mechanism, supporting the hypothesis that the influence of temperature on \nsynaptic transmission is due to acceleration of AMPAR kinetics. \n \nDiscussion \nIn the present study, we examined the influence of temperature on synaptic transmission \nfor miniature and evoked EPSCs at the calyx of Held. We found a systematic amplitude \nincrease and acceleration of EPSC kinetics with raised temperature.  These data were \ncompared with Monte Carlo simulations to and lead to the following conclusions: First: \ntemperature-dependent changes in amplitude and mEPSC time-course can be explained \nby accelerated agonist binding, unbinding and kinetics of AMPAR channel gating. It was \nsufficient to assume a single factor that equally affects all transition rates between \ndifferent AMPAR states. Their accelerated kinetics drives AMPARs into higher \nconducting states while simultaneously speeding the response. Second: evoked responses \nexhibited very similar temperature-dependent behaviour and the glutamate puffing \nexperiment and deconvolution analysis confirmed a postsynaptic site of action. \n \n21 \nmEPSCs at the Calyx of Held \nExperimental mEPSCs showed variable amplitudes, with similar skewed \namplitude distributions for both single cell and populations of neurones (Fig. 1).  \nAveraged mEPSCs were similar in amplitude and time-course to previous reports \n(Ishikawa et al., 2002; Habets & Borst, 2005) at room temperature. There was a \nsignificant increase in mean mEPSC amplitudes and acceleration in their time course \nwith increasing temperature in agreement with Kushmerick et al. (2006).   \nThese changes could stem from multiple pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms.  For \ninstance, increased filling of vesicles at room temperature increases mEPSC amplitude \n(Ishikawa et al., 2002). Our simulations show that this increase only scales linearly with \nvesicle content, with no effect on rise or decay time (data not shown, see also Franks et \nal., 2003; Raghavachari & Lisman, 2004), but substantially increases the number of \nAMPAR channels entering desensitised states. Hence vesicle filling can be excluded as a \nmajor influence on synaptic time-course, as it cannot explain the changed mEPSC \nkinetics, and as desensitisation has been shown not to increase disproportionately with \ntemperature (Kushmerick et al., 2006). \nOther factors include the release mechanism (fusion pore formation and\/or \nkinetics), glutamate diffusion across the cleft and postsynaptic AMPAR kinetics.  The \nsimulations demonstrate that increasing the diffusion coefficient led to faster but smaller \nresponses, and that speeding exocytosis increases rise times and amplitudes (see also \nStiles et al., 1996). These results illustrate that opening of the fusion pore (and not the \nreaction kinetics associated with state transitions in the AMPA receptors) limit the slope \nof mEPSCs rise time (Fig. 5A). When both these mechanisms are varied using plausible \nincreases with temperature, the changes in mEPSC kinetics were far smaller than those \nobserved experimentally, and when combined they lead to a decrease in amplitude \n(Fig. 5A). As this behaviour is inconsistent with the experimental results, we excluded an \nacceleration of diffusion and exocytosis as the primary cause of mEPSCs temperature \ndependence. It should be noted that the smallest rise times of simulated mEPSCs at 35\u00b0C \nare slightly larger than those obtained experimentally (Fig. 4D), indicating that \n22 \nexocytosis may indeed be accelerated, albeit with minor effects on mEPSC kinetics and \namplitude.  \nConversely, an acceleration of AMPAR reaction kinetics, leading to channel \nconductance changes (increased activation of higher-conducting open states) was \nsufficient to reproduce all temperature-dependent changes observed for mEPSCs (Fig. 4). \nThis result is consistent with the glutamate puffing experiments demonstrating that robust \nchanges in EPSC amplitude and kinetics can be observed even when all presynaptic \nrelease mechanisms are excluded (Fig. 7). In particular, scaling of all transition rate \nconstants by a single factor could account for all observed mEPSC changes, with reaction \nrates of glutamate binding and unbinding (KB and KU) effectively adjusting kinetics and \namplitude of the response. Scaling the other reaction rates (KO, KC and KD) by different \namounts in a certain range also allowed successful fits, but only when the binding and \nunbinding rates were adjusted accordingly. On the basis of the experimental data it was \nnot possible to distinguish between these different possibilities.  A precise distinction \nbetween pre- and postsynaptic factors would then be possible by comparing Arrhenius \nplots for mEPSCs and glutamate puffing (cf. Stiles et al., 1999). These experiments are \nhowever impractical at the calyx of Held due to the limited available recording time. \nGiven that the multiple states in the kinetic scheme could have different activation \nenergies, increasing all reaction rates by a single factor is just the simplest of many \npossible permutations which could explain the observed temperature-dependent changes. \nWe tested whether modifying single rate-constants or subgroups of rate constants could \nlead to similar effects. Changing only a single rate constant never accounted for the \nexperimental data; i.e. it is possible to increase the current amplitude by increasing kB or \nkO, but this also increases rise or decay times, contrary to the mEPSC recordings. \nChanging both rates associated with channel opening and closing (kO and kC) allows for \nfaster decay times, but with very little influence on either rise time or amplitude. \nAdditionally, increasing entry into desensitisation (kD) allows for either faster decay \ntimes or stronger currents, but they do not both change simultaneously (as in the \nexperimental data).  \n23 \nChanging the rates associated only with glutamate binding (e.g. kB by a factor 4.7 \nand kU by 8.6) did allow fitting of both the larger amplitude and faster kinetics at high \ntemperature.  The importance of this is that mEPSC rise-time essentially depends on the \nratio of kB and kU, (setting a lower boundary to the value of kB) and that these parameters \nstrongly affect the current amplitude by determining which conductance levels are \naccessible. Hence different combinations of kB and kU allow for successful fits when the \nother rate constants were changed accordingly (with kO and kC being overall less sensitive \nto changes than kD).  Thus, the simple case of scaling all rate-constants with a single \nfactor, whereby the rates of glutamate binding and unbinding (kB and kU) effectively \nadjust kinetics and amplitude of the response, represents a fair approximation of the \nexperimental data. Thus the evidence strongly indicates that the increased mEPSC \namplitude is mediated by increased occupancy of higher subconductance levels (which \nare more accessible at higher temperature) rather than a general increase in magnitude of \nthe unitary conductance or subconductance levels. This is consistent with data showing \nthat AMPAR channels have multiple conductance states, and that receptor occupancy \ndetermines the conductance (e.g. Swanson et al., 1997; Rosenmund et al., 1998; Smith & \nHowe, 2000; Smith et al., 2000; Morkve et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003; Gebhardt & Cull-\nCandy, 2006).  In contrast, attempts to reproduce the observed temperature-dependent \neffects on mEPSCs with models without multiple conductance levels (such as those \nderived by Raman & Trussell, 1992, 1995) consistently required adjustment of individual \nrate constants, as the affinity of open states (and hence the apparent affinity of the \nreceptor) had to be strongly increased to account for the larger amplitudes at higher \ntemperature. In testing the possibility that the increase in AMPAR conductance is due to \nchanges in unitary conductance\/subconductances, simulations indicate that even a modest \n(~1.2 fold) uniform increase of the conductance would substantially increase the \namplitude, but to achieve acceleration of the receptor kinetics further modification of \nreceptor gating would be required.  Indeed, increased mean channel conductance with \ntemperature is also observed in nAChRs (Dilger et al., 1991) which (as for a number of \nother channel types such as potassium channels) also possess multiple conductance \nstates (Colquhoun & Sakmann, 1985; Fox, 1987). Our results and modelling suggest that \n24 \nthe observed conductance changes on raising temperature reflect the preferred opening of \nchannels to higher conductance states. Thus, faster receptor kinetics is the primary effect \nof raising temperature (via increased agonist binding), pushing open channels into higher \nconductance levels. \nEvoked EPSCs \n In individual neurons where temperature was varied, evoked EPSCs varied in \namplitude, 10-90% rise time, decay time constant (fast) and latency in linear fashions \n(Fig. 6).  This pattern supports the idea that most of the temperature effects in this system \nare happening at the postsynaptic receptor level (since multifactorial mechanisms would \nbe less likely to follow linear trends). Furthermore the current induced by direct \napplication of glutamate (so bypassing the presynaptic release machinery) also increased \nin amplitude with increased temperature.  \nThe latency decrease of evoked EPSCs indicated that presynaptic mechanisms are more \nefficient at higher temperatures.  Changes in stimulus-evoked synaptic responses is well \ndocumented over temperature using direct recordings from calyceal terminals, with the \npresynaptic action potential shortening (Borst et al., 1995) and calcium currents getting \nlarger but quicker, leading to reduced calcium entry into the terminal during an action \npotential (Borst & Sakmann, 1998).  A recent report used the postsynaptic response as a \nmeasure of presynaptic transmitter release and interpreted the larger EPSC amplitude \nwith temperature as indicating increased release (Yang & Wang, 2006). However the \nmaintained quantal content of evoked EPSCs observed by Kushmerick et al.  (2006) \ncombined with the postsynaptic changes in AMPAR, with temperature (reported here) in \nfact supports a postsynaptic temperature-dependent mechanism.  Further to this, the \ncharge integral of evoked EPSCs remained relatively constant at the two temperatures, \nconsistent with the interpretation that presynaptic changes (i.e. reduced calcium entry, but \nincreased calcium coupling to release) mutually compensate during temperature changes \nso maintaining similar overall release probability for evoked events (Kushmerick et al., \n2006).  The increased mEPSC frequency observed with temperature could be consistent \nwith increased presynaptic calcium coupling to exocytosis, but other evidence suggests \n25 \nthat spontaneous and evoked release arise from differing vesicle pools, such that mEPSC \nfrequency can change without affecting evoked release (Sara et al., 2006). \nDeconvolution indicated that the quantal content of an evoked EPSC remained \nsimilar between room and physiological temperatures (Fig. 8). The experimental and \nmodelling data in this study strongly suggests a mechanism where cooperative binding at \nthe AMPAR is optimised at physiological temperatures and reduced at sub-physiological \ntemperatures, giving smaller and slower synaptic responses.  This is in turn is followed \nby less efficient unbinding, which accounts for the slower mEPSC decay at room \ntemperature. \nIn the auditory brainstem, binaural comparison of microsecond timing differences \ncarries information about sound localization (Grothe, 2003) and so requires extreme \nprecision of action potential timing. It is clear that higher temperatures permit higher \nfrequency transmission at the calyx of Held (Taschenberger & von Gersdorff, 2000) and \nother excitatory synapses (Saviane & Silver, 2006). The increased postsynaptic AMPAR \nresponse at higher temperatures makes synaptic transmission more secure with a higher \nsafety factor, which in turn triggers a well timed postsynaptic action potential.  In a \ncomplimentary fashion, presynaptic increases in vesicle recycling reduce the impact of \nshort term depression during high frequency stimulation (Kushmeric et al., 2006; Pyott & \nRosenmund, 2002). A combination of these pre- and postsynaptic elements explains the \nunderlying temperature-dependence of synaptic transmission, and provides a theoretical \nbasis to integrate experiments conducted at physiological and subphysiological \ntemperatures.\n26 \nReferences \n \nAndrasfalvy BK & Magee JC (2001) Distance-dependent increase in AMPA receptor \nnumber in the dendrites of adult hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.

In the same neurones (right panel) there was a linear decrease of EPSC fast decay \ntime constant with increasing temperature.  In both cells, temperature variation followed \nthe pattern 30\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C, then to 35\u00b0C and finally 25\u00b0C, illustrating the reversibility of \nthe temperature changes.  C, Pooled data from all neurones show similar trends with \nincreasing temperatures measured at 25\u00b0C (n=8), 30\u00b0C (n=9), 35\u00b0C (n=9) and 38\u00b0C \n(n=6).  EPSC amplitude (left panel) increases at higher temperatures while fast decay \ntime constant (right panel) decreases in a linear fashion with increasing temperature. \n \nFigure 7. Postsynaptic AMPAR currents evoked by direct glutamate application \nalso increase with raised temperature. \nPressure application of glutamate (5mM) produced consistently large inward currents in \nMNTB neurons held at -60 mV (in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M TTX and 2 mM kynurenate). \nA, Representative traces for 25 and 35\u00b0C showing increased current amplitude and faster \nkinetics at 35\u00b0C. B, Pressure application of aCSF alone under the same conditions \nproduced no response. C & D summarise paired data from 7 cells for peak amplitudes (C) \nand decay time constant (D) at 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C (* denotes  p<0.05 paired t-test).  \n35 \nFigure 8.  Deconvolution analysis of evoked EPSCs at 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C indicates \nsimilar quantal content at each temperature. The contribution of individual mEPSCs \nto the average shape of evoked EPSCs (top plots, 6 cells, 60 events at 25\u00b0C [black trace] \nand 6 cells, 60 events at 35\u00b0C [grey trace]) was estimated by deconvolving them with the \naverage, zero-padded mEPSCs at each temperature (6 cells, 389 events at 25\u00b0C and 6 \ncells, 1502 events at 35\u00b0C). The resulting estimated release rate is shown in the bottom \nplots. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 nA\n5 ms\n25 \u00b0C\n35 \u00b0C\nA\nEP\nSC\n A\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (-n\nA\n)\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n20 25 30 35 40\nTemperature (\u00b0C)F\nas\nt D\ne\nca\ny \n\u03c4\n(m\ns)\nB\n1 nA\n2 ms35 \u00b0C\n25 \u00b0C\nEP\nSC\n A\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (-n\nA\n)\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n20 25 30 35 40\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n20 25 30 35 40\nC\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n20 25 30 35 40\nFa\nst\n \nD\nec\na\ny \n\u03c4\n(m\ns)\n\n\n"}
