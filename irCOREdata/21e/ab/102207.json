Copyright \u0001 2003\nNew York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nAt Home in the World?\nThe Bharatanatyam Dancer As\nTransnational Interpreter\nJanet O\u2019Shea\nThe stage lights come up gradually as a bharatanatyam dancer, costumed in a\ntailored silk sari and beautifully adorned in jewelry, walks out from backstage. In\na manner neither formal nor completely relaxed, she walks downstage to a point\nbeyond the normal performing space but still removed from the audience. She be-\ngins to explain the key features of this South Indian classical dance form. More\nspecifically, she extracts, for decoding, the symbolic hand gestures known as mu-\ndras from bharatanatyam\u2019s semiotic lexicon. Standing in one place and without\nmusical accompaniment, she performs mudras fluidly and gracefully. Meanwhile,\nshe also translates into English the sahitya, or lyrics, of the song that the gestures\nwill accompany. Demonstrating her skill in elegantly balancing the competing\ntasks of speaking and rendering gestural movement, she alerts the audience to the\nlinguistic nature of the abhinaya, or dramatic dance.1\nAt the end of the synopsis, the dancer retreats backstage. A musical interlude\nsignals the beginning of the \u201cactual\u201d performance. The dancer reappears, walking\ncrisply. When she launches into the performance of the piece, her gestures flow\neasily as in the explanation, but now she augments them with evocative facial ex-\npressions and a directed use of her gaze.\nBharatanatyam, a highly technical, primarily solo South Indian classical dance\nform, consists of a repertoire and vocabulary that bifurcates into nritta, abstract\nrhythmic choreography, and nritya or abhinaya, dramatic dance. Its nonthematic\nsections consist of explosions of virtuoso footwork, performed with legs rotated\noutward into a bent-knee position that exemplifies the form\u2019s characteristically\ngrounded use of weight. An erect torso floats gracefully above the dynamic feet.\nThe abhinaya component, by contrast, organizes itself around lyrical, leisurely\nphrases of gestural movement traced by articulated fingers, hands, and arms. In\nthese segments, the dancer walks in time to the music, her body position almost\nquotidian in comparison with the sharply delineated positions of the more stac-\ncato phrases.\nPreperformance explanations have characterized bharatanatyam performances\nover the course of the 20th century. In the mid-1920s, when brahman lawyer E.\nBharatanatyam 177\nKrishna Iyer initiated his mission to resurrect bharatanatyam as a cultural treasure,\nhe did so through lecture demonstrations as well as performances, which he\noffered in cities and towns of Southern India (Arudra 1986\/87b:33). Jewish-\nAmerican dancer Ragini Devi\u2019s first international tours of classical Indian dance\nforms in 1937 and 1938 consisted of lecture demonstrations as well as concerts\n(The Civil and Military Gazette 1938).2 In the mid-1940s, Ram Gopal introduced\nto his tightly designed series of short, classical Indian dances brief verbal explana-\ntions, which preceded each dance with a sketch of its overall theme (David\n2001:35\u201336). The specific practice of executing mudras while offering a verbal\ninterpretation of sung poetic texts rose in popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s.\nDuring the early 1990s, the practice became so prevalent that dancers imported\nexplanation into Indian performance contexts, including into bharatanatyam\u2019s\nhome city of Chennai, formerly Madras.3\nThe demand for translation signals bharatanatyam\u2019s 20th-century history of\nrecontextualization and its long-standing international circulation. The practice\nof interlocution both responds to and obscures the dance form\u2019s participation\nin a global culture market. It reveals the kind of historical double binds4 with\nwhich the late-20th-century bharatanatyam dancer contended. The practice of\nverbal explanation thus speaks to the 20th-century predicament of bharatanatyam\nin which the dance form appears internationally as both an emblem of national\nand diasporic identity and as a \u201chigh art\u201d that transcends national and linguistic\nboundaries.\nAt the same time, however, verbal translation paradoxically accords the chore-\nography an inscrutability while also demonstrating its translatability. This kind of\npreperformance synopsis lines up two thought systems: an English verbal frame-\nwork and a South Indian choreographic one. The explanation of mudras in\nsuccession interprets the \u201cEastern\u201d choreography through the \u201cWestern\u201d linguis-\ntic system. The English-language epistemology thereby emerges as the means\nthrough which the audience finds the choreography intelligible. Thus, this style\nof translation relies upon a problematic5 that treats the English-language frame-\nwork as a mere explanatory device without its own cultural coding. A spoken in-\nterlocution thus risks representing bharatanatyam more as a means of entry into a\ncultural field of reference,6 than as a set of choreographic choices and composi-\ntional devices.7\nOrientalism and Globality\nWhen a dancer, viewer, or promoter presents bharatanatyam as both requiring\nand evading translation and treats the English-language explanation as culturally\n\u201cneutral,\u201d s\/he revisits the central premise of the 18th- and 19th-century orien-\ntalist treatment of Indian literary and scholarly texts.8 The orientalist model of\ntranslation rested on the assumption that the \u201cEastern\u201d text required the interven-\ntion of an interlocutor who, through his9 specialist knowledge, could unlock its\nmysteries for \u201cthe West.\u201d The public who received this information, within the ori-\nentalist paradigm, inhabited the position of subject rather than object of knowl-\nedge. The representation of \u201cforeign\u201d texts and practices within 19th-century\nEuropean society thus did not encourage viewers\/readers to examine their own\ncultural investments but rather reinforced the presumed objectivity of their own\nsocial and political position.10\nPreperformance translations, like the textual material of the colonial orientalist\nperiod, characterize bharatanatyam as an object of knowledge, to be uncovered\nand explained by an expert interlocutor. Nonetheless, they invert an orientalist\ndivision of labor by conflating the roles of \u201cnative informant\u201d and translator-\nauthor. As such, the translating dancer generalizes her own subject position by\n178 Janet O\u2019Shea\ninterlocuting for the dance form. The act of translation,\nthen, marginalizes the dance form for its international\nviewership, designating it as that which requires expli-\ncation; but at the same time, this translation universal-\nizes the dancer\u2019s status as she adopts the position of the\nagent of information.\nThe very appearance of verbal translation, however,\ncomplicates even this dichotomy between subjects and\nobjects of knowledge. While a preperformance synop-\nsis foregrounds the dance\u2019s \u201cforeign-ness,\u201d its stan-\ndardized mode of delivery reveals the dance form\u2019s\nhistory of international circulation. Bharatanatyam, as\nwell as sadir before it,11 circulated internationally and\nresponded to global discourses on dance. This trans-\nnational circulation dates back to, and, in some in-\nstances, anticipated the bharatanatyam \u201crevival\u201d of the\n1930s and 1940s.12\nThe international performance careers of both In-\ndian and non-Indian dancers inflected the refiguration\nof the previously marginal sadir as the respectable con-\ncert form bharatanatyam.13 Modern dance forerunner\nRuth St. Denis (Coorlawala 1992; Allen 1997),14 balle-\nrina and choreographer Anna Pavlova,15 and Indian modernist Uday Shankar\n(Erdman 1987)16 all played a role in the bharatanatyam revival, encouraging the\nreturn of audience members\u2019 and dancers\u2019 attention to Indian classical arts. Con-\nversely, Balasaraswati\u2019s emphasis on expressivity won admirers among pre- and\nearly modern dancers such as Ted Shawn and Martha Graham (Cowdery 1995:51;\nLa Meri 1985:12; Pattabhi Raman and Ramachandran 1984:26) who found in her\nclaim that interior experience articulated universal themes (Balasaraswati 1988) a\ncorroboration of their own views on artistry. The early 20th-century refiguration\nof bharatanatyam as a stage practice likewise intersected with a global, modernist\nconcern with the reinvention of dance as a serious \u201chigh\u201d art. Revival period\npractitioners like Rukmini Devi and Balasaraswati both invoked discourses of in-\ndividual creativity in their representation and legitimation of bharatanatyam.17\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, bharatanatyam circulated through ever-more global tra-\njectories. The dance form operates as, in Arjun Appadurai\u2019s (1996) terms, inten-\ntional cultural reproduction for nonresident Indians in places as divergent as Los\nAngeles, Singapore, and Manchester. Bharatanatyam likewise provides a means of\nmaintaining nationalist sentiment in exile for Sri Lankan Tamils in Canada, Ger-\nmany, and the U.K.18 Practitioners of this dance form have brought it to such dis-\nparate locales as Japan and Argentina. Iconic representations of bharatanatyam\nappear in advertisements and travel guides; bharatanatyam dancers formed the\nback-up routine for Madonna\u2019s performance for the 1999 MTV music video\nawards. The practice of this dance form likewise offers the successful performer\ninternational travel opportunities19 and acclaim, and requires a global orientation\nto achieve this level of success. Dancers who strive to maintain professional lives\nin Chennai perform internationally in order to attain a level of financial reim-\nbursement that offsets the generally low honoraria offered by Chennai venues and\nto generate the credibility needed to maintain the interest of Chennai promot-\ners.20 This state of transnational circulation, like the bharatanatyam revival\u2019s rela-\ntionship to international discourses of dance, marks the concert art form as\n\u201calways-already\u201d global.21\nTranslation not only operated as a method for negotiating this international cir-\nculation of dancers and choreographies, but also provided dancers with a strategy\n1. Subathra Subramaniam\n(left) and Mayuri Boonham\nfrom the British dance com-\npany Angika (2001).\n(Photo by London Dong)\nBharatanatyam 179\nfor marketing their performance work in transnational dance milieus. By the late\n20th century, bharatanatyam\u2019s reputation as a reclaimed and respectable tradition\nproduced a proliferation of trained and accomplished dancers. Chennai, for much\nof the last century, housed a surplus of bharatanatyam dancers in relation to its\nviewing public (Coorlawala 1996:71; Gaston 1996:119\u201321; Meduri 1996:xl)22 as\ndid other Indian and international metropolises. In order to develop a career as a\nperformer, a dancer, facing such a surfeit, can contend with her competition by\ncultivating new audiences. This task presents obstacles as the complex coding of\nbharatanatyam requires specialized skills on the part of audience members for full\ncomprehension. When a dancer translates a piece before performing it, she bridges\na perceived gap between content and perception, thereby enabling a broader range\nof spectators to access the piece.23\nAlthough verbal interlocution reiterates an orientalist problematic, the factors\nthat foster the appearance of interlocution unsettle orientalist notions of a static\ntradition. The 20th-century\u2019s translating bharatanatyam dancer, rather than rep-\nresenting an ancient, unchanged culture, grappled with numerous, contemporary\nparadoxes. While some practitioners of the 1980s and early 1990s used verbal in-\nterlocution to contend with competing pressures upon the dance form, cho-\nreographers of the mid- to late 1990s, especially those working internationally,24\ndeveloped projects that \u201ctranslate\u201d (Erdman 1987) epistemologies, choreographic\ndevices, and poetic texts, foregrounding rather than masking their transnational\nposition.25 These projects align different linguistic, movement, and musical vocab-\nularies in such a way that they subvert a tendency to place European thought sys-\ntems as the primary framework of interpretation.\nTactics of Globality: Alternatives to Orientalism\nToronto-based choreographer Hari Krishnan\u2019s composition When God Is a\nCustomer (1999)26 relies upon verbal translation but uses Telegu songs and their\nEnglish translation, each as an accompaniment to different kinds of choreography.\nThe piece counterposes sections that feature short, Telegu-language songs, which\nKrishnan27 interprets through bharatanatyam\u2019s stylized gestures, with phrases of\neither quotidian gesture or abstract expressionist, contemporary dance\u2013derived\nmovement. The latter is accompanied by a spoken English translation of the po-\netic text projected over the sound system. This strategy retains bharatanatyam\u2019s\ncharacteristic relationship of dance to text. The piece de-exoticizes the mudra sys-\ntem for its Canadian audience, however, by treating it as equivalent to expression-\nist and pedestrian movement vocabularies.\nAs the poems begin, the lights come up slightly and Krishnan materializes out\nof the shadows. Barely visible in silhouette, he suggests, through stylized gestures,\nan intimate encounter between a courtesan and her god-lover. In silence, seated\non a pedestal, Krishnan mimes the heroine\u2019s awakening the following day, stretch-\ning his arms, throwing back his head, and using small delicate movements to sug-\ngest the lady\u2019s ablutions. He holds a dignified, feminine pose, with a straight arm\npropped on a raised knee, accompanied by the voice-over of an English phrase\nthat expresses the courtesan\u2019s joy: \u201cToday is a good day.\u201d\nKrishnan stands, descends from the pedestal, and, in conjunction with the sung\nTelegu lyrics, uses mudras and facial expressions to convey the mood of the song.\nHe traverses the stage in a stately manner, walking in time to the music. In the role\nof the heroine, Krishnan extends his hands and draws them back, indicating the\nrequest \u201cask him to come.\u201d Subsequently, he raises a hand to his forehead and ex-\ntends it forward, bowing slightly, conveying the promise \u201cI will give him a royal\nwelcome.\u201d He develops this mood of joyous anticipation, tracing his articulate\nhands and arms through improvised elaborations that invoke the regal status of the\n180 Janet O\u2019Shea\nabsent lover. At the end of the Telegu song, Krishnan resumes a more quotidian\npose as he represents the woman patiently awaiting the paramour\u2019s arrival.\nThe piece proceeds in this manner as stylized mudras sculpt the particular im-\nages referred to in the Telegu refrains, the tone of which Krishnan conveys\nthrough semirealistic facial expression. During the English translation, however,\nhis countenance remains neutral and he either holds a suggestive pose or extracts\none word from the line of poetry, the connotations of which he invokes through\nthe expansion of a symbolic gesture. For other phrases of English text, he suggests\nemotional overtones through full-body positioning rather than through facial ex-\npression and gestures with a specific linguistic meaning. For example, in one sec-\ntion, as the poetry describes the heroine\u2019s anxiety, he contracts his torso, bringing\nhis hands to the center of his chest. He follows this sinking of the chest with a\ncounteracting arch of the spine, led by the hands. He reaches his arms out from\nhis center, pulling his entire torso into an open flexion and creates a vulnerable\nlook that supplements the straining arms.\nIn creating the piece, Krishnan aligned the Telegu songs so that they formed a\nlinear narrative (1999). As a result, the non-Telegu speaking audience member can\nanticipate the development of the theme as it unfolds, aided not only by English\ntranslation but also by the momentum of the storyline as evoked by Krishnan\u2019s\ngestures. Rather than dwell on a process of decoding, the non-Telegu speaking\nviewer\u2019s attention can focus on the choreographic priorities of the\nbharatanatyam-derived movement as well as the more expressionist ones. Krish-\nnan\u2019s alternation between stylized gesture for Telegu songs and a more abstracted\nvocabulary for their English translation therefore speaks directly to the problem-\natic of interpretation for an international audience.28\nIn When God Is a Customer, Krishnan provides an alternate solution to a pre-\nperformance explanation by situating verbal interpretation within the work itself.\nInstead of mystifying the bharatanatyam text by providing a synopsis of the pre-\nsumably cryptic mudras, Krishnan accompanies both English and Telegu sections\nwith movement. He therefore equates the languages by treating both as dance ac-\ncompaniment rather than presenting one as the explanatory device for the other.\nBy contrast, Triple Hymn (2000) by Angika, a British dance company consisting\nof dancer-choreographers Mayuri Boonham and Subathra Subramaniam, trans-\nlates not linguistic but melodic, choreographic, and rhythmic components into\none another. The choreography interweaves bharatanatyam and carnatic music\nwith European classical music. To the sounds of a European operatic melodic\nstructure based on the words of the Sanskrit Gayatri Mantra and on a recitation of\nvarious names of Hindu goddesses, two dancers in classical costume render lyrical\ngestures from the bharatanatyam movement vocabulary. During the Gayatri Man-\ntra section, they perform symbolic mudras, suggesting worship, prayer, and other\nritual actions. They subsequently depict the various forms of the goddess through\ncharacteristic iconographic poses.\nRather than treat bharatanatyam as a cultural icon that depends on a European\nvocabulary for clarification, Triple Hymn places two signifiers of classicism\u2014bhar-\natanatyam and European classical music\u2014alongside each other. Boonham and\nSubramaniam intertwine two traditional forms instead of interpreting one\nthrough the other. The choreographers thereby make explicit the cross-cultural\nexchange that fostered the project. The piece speaks to the dynamic, cosmopoli-\ntan London environment in which it was performed and, by pointing to such an\nongoing interculturality, queries the need for explication.\nCanadian choreographer Lata Pada\u2019s Cosmos (1999), like Triple Hymn, finds\nsimilarities in two different epistemological systems. As its name implies, the work\nconcerns itself with theories of universal creation. Cosmos opens on a semidark-\nened, empty stage. A narrator, invisible but audible over the sound system, trans-\nBharatanatyam 181\nlates into English a quote from the Creation Hymn, of\nthe Rig Veda. The stanza reflects on the paradox of uni-\nversal creation: \u201cIn the beginning there was nothing\nand there was not nothing.\u201d The unoccupied stage\nspace reinforces the mysteriousness of the quote. An\nensemble of dancers bursts forth from the wings, per-\nforating the charged vacuum with their interjections\nof dynamic, rhythmic phrases. The dancers careen\nthrough the space, pursuing one another into an in-\ncreasingly tighter spiral.\nThey wind their way into a close circle. They pause\nfor a moment, tense in their stillness, before launching\na phrase of staccato footwork. Each dancer takes a wide\nstance with legs rotated out and knees bent, hands at\nher waist. Their alternating pattern of footwork impels\ntheir bodies across the stage as the center appears to\neject them outward. Their trajectories, linear at first,\ncurve and cross, becoming increasingly chaotic. The\nensemble, initially united, fractures into a collection of\nindividual dancers, each tracing her own divergent spa-\ntial pathway after a \u201cbig bang\u201d of explosive footwork.\nIn the next scene, the dancers condense their traveling movements into parallel\npaths that follow specific orbits. Their routes widen and flatten elliptically so that\nthey cross one another without pushing each other off course. While the first\nscene traced a transition from disorder to equilibrium, this scene moves from or-\nder to disruption. The dancers\u2019 set orbits waver as they deviate from their clear\nroutes. The performers succumb to the pull of a black hole, resuming a pulsating\nphrase that indicates their increasing momentum as they catapult toward center\nstage.\nThe closing sections evince the harmony of the solar system. The dancers now\ndevelop cooperative relationships with one another, again interweaving without\ncolliding or disrupting one another\u2019s trajectories. They break off into duets. Back\nto back, the dancers exchange weight, arms and hands articulating themselves into\nclassical bharatanatyam mudras as bodies remain taut and straight even in tilted po-\nsitions. The stylized gestures and the dancers\u2019 verticality reinforce the image of\nstability and balance in the relationships between the relatively proximate heav-\nenly bodies.\nPada\u2019s piece depicts the creation of the universe by tracking the transition from\nthe churning of nebulous, protoplasmic energy, its explosion into defined pieces\nof matter, and its ultimate condensation into the specific orbits of heavenly bodies.\nThe choreography thereby blends the theories of creation put forth by European\nrationalist, scientific traditions, and by Vedic philosophy. As such, Cosmos explains\nthe two epistemological systems through one another. The work, by placing the\nVedic hymn at the beginning of a depiction of the \u201cbig bang,\u201d highlights the con-\ntradiction at the center of both the Vedic and scientific explanations of creation in\nthat each hypothesis suggests that matter arose from an undefined primordial en-\nergy. Although Pada uses an English translation of the hymn, she nonetheless fore-\ngrounds the South Asian text as she uses it to demonstrate the paradox imbedded\nin the \u201cbig bang\u201d theory rather than using the cosmological hypothesis to argue\nfor the rationality of the philosophical tract. In contrast to an orientalist project of\ntranslation, therefore, her composition does not treat the European scientific\nmodel as an objective explanation but rather foregrounds how its contradictions\necho the concerns of the Vedic philosophical tract. Thus, the South Asian knowl-\nedge system frames the scientific paradigm, a maneuver that reverses the premise\nof orientalist translation practices.\n2.

(Photo\nby Cylla von Tiedemann)\n182 Janet O\u2019Shea\nEach of these late-century projects offers bharatanat-\nyam an active role in a cosmopolitan urban environ-\nment by deploying methods of exchange between\nepistemologies that circumvent or reverse an orientalist\nproblematic. Krishnan retains the translation paradigm\nbut de-exoticizes the relationship between text and ges-\nture by using English and Telegu in an equivalent man-\nner. Boonham and Subramaniam create a harmonious\nfusion of classical disciplines and symbols that highlights\nthe hybrid positioning of performers and viewers alike\nand, therefore, questions the need for translation at all.\nPada, like Krishnan, examines different thought systems\nthrough one another and inverts an orientalist frame by\ninterpreting the European epistemology through the\nVedic philosophical one rather than vice versa. Each of\nthese projects treats bharatanatyam as an entity that re-\nsponds to the hybridity of its immediate, urban envi-\nronment rather than as a discrete entity that requires\nexplanation.\nI began this essay with the image of the translating\nbharatanatyam dancer in order to query the historical\nlegacy of this practice and, in doing so, to demonstrate\nwhat kinds of cultural and political dilemmas the late-\n20th-century bharatanatyam practitioner faced. I sug-\ngested that verbal interlocutions retain orientalist frames but also that they emerge\nout of factors that belie orientalist narratives of unchanging tradition. The late-\ncentury experiments that I discuss here engage explicitly with bharatanatyam\u2019s\ntransnational position and offer the possibility that choreographic translations can\nmove beyond orientalist models of interpretation. These choreographies, rather\nthan representing isolated experiments, speak to the dance form\u2019s history of stra-\ntegic negotiation with globality and hybridity as well as with the staging of local,\nregional, and national affiliations. In offering an alternative to orientalist para-\ndigms, these projects present the possibility that practitioners can contend with\nthe dance form\u2019s complex historical legacy while also challenging viewer expec-\ntations. As such, they level the choreographic field so that the dance form can\ntruly be at home in the world.\nNotes\n1. This essay is based on presentations given at the Association for Asian Studies (2000) and\nDance Under Construction (2001) conferences.\n2. Ragini Devi performed bharatanatyam and kathakali. She was among the first foreigners to\nperform Indian classical dance forms, the first nonhereditary dancers of both forms, and the\nfirst female kathakali dancers.\n3. The city of Madras was officially renamed Chennai in the late 1990s, a shift that reinstated\nthe Tamil name of the metropolis.\nI base this observation of the relative prevalence of preperformance translation on my\nexperience viewing international bharatanatyam concerts from 1988 to the present and in\ncomparisons between concerts in Chennai in 1989, 1995 to 1996, and 1999.\nBy using the phrase \u201chome city,\u201d I do not mean to suggest that the relationship between\nbharatanatyam and Madras\/Chennai is organic and unself-conscious. Bharatanatyam estab-\nlished itself in Madras at the time of the bharatanatyam revival of the 1930s. This relationship\ndid not go uncontested nor did it merely fix bharatanatyam in this city. The relationship be-\ntween bharatanatyam, urbanization, and transnationalism requires more attention than I can\ngive it here. For more information, see my discussion of bharatanatyam\u2019s production of lo-\ncality (2001:155\u2013213).\n3. Hari Krishnan at the\nDarasuran temple in\nTanjavur, India.

I borrow this idea of the historical double binds of bharatanatyam from scholar and chore-\nographer Avanthi Meduri who has designed a series of lectures in which she represents the\ntensions of gender, subjectivity, modernity, and nationhood through a performed limp.\n5. I borrow this notion of a problematic of orientalism from Partha Chatterjee (1986). Chatter-\njee argues that postcolonial nations inverted the problematic of colonialism\u2014independence\nrather than continued subjugation\u2014but relied upon the same thematic, that of a binary dif-\nference between \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest.\u201d Here, I reverse Chatterjee\u2019s argument in order to draw\nout a shared problematic between 18th- and 19th-century scholarly and 20th-century pre-\nperformance translations.\n6. British choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh comments on the assumption that contemporary\ndance derived from Indian movement vocabularies serves a function more \u201ccultural\u201d than\nartistic and links this premise to the practice of offering word-for-gesture translations\n(1995:192). Jeyasingh commences her Making of Maps (1991) with a deconstruction of the\npreperformance synopsis. Dancers\u2019 voices, projected over the sound system, intersect and in-\nterrupt one another with phrases like \u201cvanakkam; good evening\u201d and \u201cthe tillana is a dance\nof joy.\u201d Meanwhile, the ensemble moves slowly and decisively into and out of postures de-\nrived from bharatanatyam nritta choreography. Their impassive facial expressions contrast\nwith the sunny voices of the verbal accompaniment.\n7. Jeyasingh also identifies an over-emphasis on literal meaning in the British reception of In-\ndian performance forms ( Jeyasingh 1982:4).\n8. Edward Said cites the scholarship of Sir William Jones in the late 18th century as the incep-\ntion of orientalist scholarship in India (1979:75).\n9. Here, I use the masculine pronoun intentionally in order to emphasize the gendered invest-\nments of orientalist thought. See Koritz (1997) for more on the gendered underpinnings of\nOrientalism.\n10. A classic example of this phenomenon is the 19th-century colonial exhibitions in Europe\n(Mitchell 1992).\n11. \u201cBayaderes\u201d (temple dancers) from South India appeared in Europe for the first time in 1838.\n12. \u201cRevival\u201d is the most commonly used term for the reformulation of sadir as the concert art\nform bharatanatyam. As Matthew Allen suggests, however, this term is \u201cdrastically reductive\u201d\nbecause this shift also consisted of a \u201cre-population,\u201d \u201cre-construction,\u201d \u201cre-naming,\u201d \u201cre-\nsituation,\u201d and \u201cre-storation\u201d (1997:63).\n13. The bharatanatyam revival\u2014including its politics and its historical investments\u2014has already\nreceived much scholarly attention and therefore I only gesture to it here. I refer to, for in-\nstance, Allen (1997), Coorlawala (1992, 1996), Gaston (1992, 1996), Meduri (1988, 1996),\nand Srinivasan (1983, 1985), as well as my own essay on the contrasting perspectives of Bal-\nasaraswati and Rukmini Devi (1998).\n14. St. Denis performed her Nautch Dance and Radha before Indian audiences in 1926. Uttara\nAsha Coorlawala (1992) maintains that her performances encouraged Indian viewers to seek\nout the dance forms on which St. Denis based her choreography. Allen likewise notes this\ninfluence but also emphasizes that the direct impact of the Denishawn company on India was\n\u201cshort-lived\u201d (1997:91).\n15. Anna Pavlova, who brought ballet to the status of \u201cautonomous art,\u201d encouraged Rukmini\nDevi to seek out the art form of \u201c[her] own country\u201d (in Ramnarayan 1984a:29). Joan Erd-\nman discusses in some detail the influence that Pavlova had on Uday Shankar (1987:71\u201373)\nwho, in turn, was a \u201ccatalyst to the renaissance in Indian classical dance\u201d (69).\n16. Shankar influenced the revival of classical Indian arts in several ways. First, as Erdman indi-\ncates, Shankar participated in the institutionalization processes that supported the classical\nIndian dance revivals by providing his students with training in bharatanatyam, kathakali, and\nmanipuri alongside his own technique and improvisation classes (1987:84). He also helped to\nspark the career of legendary devadasi dancer T. Balasaraswati. At Balasaraswati\u2019s first concert\nat the Music Academy in 1933, Shankar, as a member of the audience, was so captivated by\nher dancing that he requested a repeat performance. Haren Ghosh, a friend of Shankar and\nan impresario, who also attended the performance arranged Balasaraswati\u2019s first concert out-\nside of southern India, which led to other concerts in north India and, ultimately, interna-\ntionally (Arudra 1986\/87a:25, 1986\/87c:20).\n17. Both Balasaraswati and Rukmini Devi located in bharatanatyam opportunities for creativity\nand individual expression. While Rukmini Devi found creative expression in the composi-\ntion of new dances which, she maintained, sprang from traditional aesthetics (Ramnarayan\n184 Janet O\u2019Shea\n1984b:32), Balasaraswati found opportunities for imaginative work in improvised sections of\nthe inherited repertoire (Balasaraswati 1988:39).\n18. I am indebted to Jeyanthy Siva for first calling my attention to the use of bharatanatyam in\nthe production of Tamil nationalist sentiment.\n19. For instance, Gaston states that younger generations of icai vellala (the caste group that largely\nconstituted devadasi communities) dancers have pursued professional performance in recent\nyears because of the possibility it provides for international travel (1996:129).\n20. I base this observation on personal correspondence (1995\u20131996, 1999) with Chennai-based\ndancers who are at different levels of renown and seniority.\n21. I borrow the application of this Derridean phrase from Meduri (1996:400). Meduri uses this\nphrase to query the gendered implications of the air of respectability that bharatanatyam ac-\nquired in the mid- to late 20th century.\n22. Senior dancer and teacher Kalanidhi Narayanan describes this surfeit through reference to\n\u201csupply and demand\u201d (1999). She suggests that Madras simply cannot provide solo concerts\nfor all of its dancers as the number of dancers outweighs the number of performance slots.\nGaston likewise identifies a \u201cdance boom\u201d that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s (1996:119\u2013\n20).\n23. Performers use other methods of bridging a gap in comprehension, including the provision\nof libretti and, more rarely, the use of supratitles.\n24. Translation experiments are not, however, exclusive to performances in non-Indian con-\ntexts. Chennai-based choreographer Gitanjali Kolanad\u2019s What She Said (1993), for example,\ndeploys scholar A.K. Ramanujan\u2019s English translations of Tamil Sangam poetry. Maharash-\ntrian bharatanatyam dancer Sucheta Chapekar has reconstructed 17th- and 18th-century\nMarathi-language dance compositions and has integrated Hindustani (North Indian classical)\nmusic with bharatanatyam (Sethuraman 1985:46).\n25. Experiments with cross-cultural interpretation are not unique to the late 20th century. For\ninstance, as Joan Erdman (1987) argues, modernist Uday Shankar\u2019s work translated Indian\naesthetic components into European compositional frameworks.\n26. Named after a scholarly text of the same title (Ramanujan, Narayana Rao, and Shulman,\n1994).\n27. Here, in the interest of consistency and in capitulation to European and American conven-\ntions of nomenclature, I identify dancers and choreographers by their second names. This\ncreates an awkward fit with Indian, and especially South Indian, naming conventions. How-\never, I do this to avoid a situation in which scholars appear by last name and dancers by first\nname, an approach which might suggest that choreography is a less serious enterprise than\nwriting.\n28. The piece would have a different, although not necessarily predictable, effect in Chennai.\nThe majority of dance viewers in Chennai speak Tamil with a significant minority speaking\nTelegu as their first language. Dance compositions until recently used a number of different\nlanguages, primarily Tamil, Telegu, and Sanskrit. In Chennai, as elsewhere, an emphasis on\nthe comprehensibility of poetic texts has increased. Dancers, choreographers, and promoters\nhave responded to this concern by presenting more pieces in the Tamil language (Nandini\nRamani 1999).\nReferences\nAllen, Matthew\n1997 \u201cRewriting the Script for South Indian Dance.\u201d TDR 41, 3 (T155):63\u2013100.\nAppadurai, Arjun\n1996 Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization.
