From bias offset\nvoltage dependent measurements, it is concluded that the delayed fluorescence is generated via triplet-\ntriplet annihilation. A fast and efficient triplet exciton quenching by charge carriers is found to occur in\nthe active polymer layer of the working devices.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.90.127402 PACS numbers: 78.55.Kz, 78.60.Fi\nSince the first report of electroluminescence (EL) in\npolymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) by Burroughes\net al. [1], a great deal of research has been devoted to\nunderstanding the photophysical properties of conjugated\npolymers. Luminescence in PLEDs is usually governed\nby the radiative recombination of singlet excitons. It\nfollows from spin statistics and spin dependent recombi-\nnation that between 50% to 75% of all recombination\nevents within a PLED can produce triplet excitons, thus\nas little as 25% generates singlet excitons [2,3]. For\npoly(9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl) (PF2\/6), it\nis suggested that less than one triplet exciton is formed\nfor every singlet exciton [3]. Even given the latter sce-\nnario, efficient radiative triplet recombination would en-\nhance PLED performance by at least 50%. Therefore,\ncharacterizing the nature and photophysics of triplet\nstates of light emitting polymer systems is extremely\nimportant. Direct spectroscopic information on triplet\nstates of conjugated polymers can be obtained from de-\nlayed emission lasting up to several seconds, i.e., phos-\nphorescence (Ph) and delayed fluorescence (DF). How-\never, DF in conjugated polymers can originate from either\ntriplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) [4] or recombination\nof geminate (Coulombically bound) electron-hole pairs\neffectively trapped within the active polymer layer [5].\nIt is already reported that conjugated polymers emit Ph\nand DF at low temperature upon photoexcitation [5\u20137].\nHowever, until now, there is no report of intrinsic electro-\nphosphorescence from conjugated polymers commonly\nused for PLED fabrication. There have been several re-\nports in the literature on the observation of \u2018\u2018after glow\u2019\u2019\nfrom PLEDs operated in pulsed mode [8\u201310]. However,\nthis has invariably been ascribed to both fast (15 ns) and\nslow (1 \u0001s) decaying components of the swept out charge\ncarriers upon switch off [9]. No spectroscopy was made\non this after glow light to determine its true origin.\nSeveral workers observed electrophosphorescence from\nPLEDs by doping the polymer layer with phosphorescent\ndye molecules containing heavy metal atoms (platinum)\n[11,12]. Very recently, Lupton et al. [13] reported electro-\nphosphorescence from a diaryl (diphenyl)-substituted\nderivative of ladder-type poly(paraphenylene) (PhLPPP)\nby incorporating covalently bound heavy metal atoms\n(palladium) into the polymer backbone, thereby increas-\ning the spin-orbit coupling and, hence, the triplet popu-\nlation. In this Letter, we report for the first time the\nobservation of truly intrinsic electrophosphorescence\nand delayed electroluminescence from pristine PF2\/6\nthin film. This is a very important observation keeping\nin mind that the real photophysics in the active polymer\nlayer in PLEDs is governed by charge recombination and\nnot photoexcitation. Here, we note that, although poly-\nfluorenes have been under intensive study for many years,\nits electrophosphorescence could not be observed before\nmainly because of the lack of experimental sensitivity.\nThe complete experimental setup (vide infra), presently\navailable in our laboratory, makes it possible to detect and\ntime gate the weak electrophosphorescence signal from\npolyfluorene based devices, which requires a N2 glove box\nto fabricate the PLEDs, a fast pulse generator to apply the\ndriving bias voltage pulses across the devices, and a high\ngain charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to record the\nelectrophosphorescence signal.\nPF2\/6 is widely used as the active layer in bright EL\ndevices [14,15]. The general spectroscopic features of\nPF2\/6 have been reported in several publications\n[16,17]. From photoluminescence (PL) measurements,\nit is already known that PF2\/6 thin film emits Ph and\nDF at low temperature (<100 K) upon photoexcitation\n[6,7]. Based on the PL intensity dependence of Ph and DF\non the excitation pulse energy and decay kinetics mea-\nsurements, it was argued that DF in PF2\/6 thin film\noriginates from TTA [6,7]. It is to be noted that prompt\nfluorescence of PF2\/6 exhibits a weak keto defect emis-\nsion band at about 515 nm upon photoexcitation [18].\nHowever, the keto defect emission band becomes very\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 MARCH 2003VOLUME 90, NUMBER 12\n127402-1 0031-9007=03=90(12)=127402(4)$20.00 \uf6d9 2003 The American Physical Society 127402-1\nprominent when the polymer film is excited via charge\nrecombination due to charge carrier trapping. In order to\navoid this unwanted keto defect emission band, we used\nPF2\/6 endcapped with bis(4-methylphenyl)phenylamine\nwith a monomer\/endcapper feed ratio (mol=mol) as 96:4\n(PF2\/6am4) (inset of Fig. 1) in the present work. The\nketo defect emission band is almost completely sup-\npressed in the prompt fluorescence from the devices based\non PF2\/6am4 as the active emitting layer [18].\nLEDs were fabricated on solution etched indium tin\noxide (ITO) coated glass substrates as described previ-\nously [15]. Briefly, a 30 nm thick hole-transporting layer\n(HTL) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with\npolystyrene sulphonated acid (PEDOT) was spin coated\non the ITO layers and dried overnight. PF2\/6am4 was\ndissolved in toluene and the solution was spin coated\nonto the HTL coated substrates to give an active layer\nwith a thickness of 80 nm. The synthesis of the conju-\ngated polymer PF2\/6am4 has been described elsewhere\n[18,19]. Calcium cathodes (50 nm) were evaporated onto\nthe polymer layer, followed by a capping layer of alumi-\nnum (50 nm), in a N2 glove box. A Hewlett-Packard pulse\ngenerator (8114A) was used to apply the bias voltage\npulses with a typical rise and fall time of 10 ns. For\nbias offset dependent measurements, a unity voltage\ngain differential amplifier was used with a Keithley\n2400 used to provide dc bias offset voltages. The electro-\nluminescence emitted by the device was dispersed by a\nmonochromator (TRIAX 180, JOBIN YVON-SPEX) and\nrecorded by a red enhanced, gated intensified CCD cam-\nera (4 Picos, Stanford Computer Optics) [7]. This camera\npermits variable integration and delay times allowing\ntime-resolved detection of electroluminescence with\nvery high gain from 200 ps up to 80 s after the device\nis turned off. All experiments were performed under a\ndynamical vacuum of <10\u00014 Torr in a temperature con-\ntrolled helium cryostat.\nThe prompt fluorescence spectra of PF2\/6am4 thin film\nunder the application of a bias voltage at low tempera-\nture (28 K) (Fig. 1) are identical to those reported by\nseveral authors as observed upon photoexcitation [6,7].\nThe solid line in Fig. 1 shows the delayed electrolumi-\nnescence of PF2\/6am4 thin film at 28 K. The device is\nkept ON for 5 ms (electric pulse width), and then a delay\ntime of 5 ms is applied after which the delayed emission\nis measured with an integration time (detection gate\nwidth) of 70 ms. In this way, the weak delayed emission\ncan be observed without being swamped by the intense\nprompt fluorescence. The delayed emission spectra ex-\nhibit similar features to those previously observed by\nseveral workers by PL measurements [6,7]. The high\nenergy part of the delayed emission spectra is identical\nto the prompt fluorescence spectra at 28 K and is attrib-\nuted to DF. The low energy part of the delayed emission\nspectra exhibits two vibronic bands, the first one at 2.19 eV\nand the second one at 2.02 eV. It possesses a vibronic\nstructure similar to that of the prompt fluorescence spec-\ntra at 28 K and is logically attributed to Ph. It is note-\nworthy that this is the first observation of intrinsic\nelectrophosphorescence in a conjugated polymer. The\nimportance of this observation lies in the fact that it gives\na straightforward way to study the triplet state photo-\nphysics in the active polymer layer of PLEDs.\nIn order to see the origin of the DF observed in the\npresent investigations, we measured the delayed emission\nspectra at 28 K at a drive bias voltage of 12 V, as a\nfunction of bias offset voltage after the device is turned\noff. The bias offset of the voltage pulse was varied below\nthe turn-on voltage of the device (4.0 V) [20], keeping the\npulse amplitude constant at 12 V.

However, the EL intensities of Ph as\nwell as DF decrease gradually with the increase in re-\nverse bias offset voltage (inset of Fig. 2). If geminate pair\nrecombination is responsible for the observed DF, then\nincrease in reverse bias offset voltage should lower the\nDF intensity without affecting the Ph intensity at all\n[13]. Thus, our findings clearly rule out geminate pair\nrecombination to be responsible for the observed DF. The\nfact that both Ph and DF intensities decrease (the latter\nalbeit faster than the former) with the increase in reverse\nbias offset voltage strongly suggests that both have the\nsame origin, i.e., triplets. Thus, the DF observed upon\ncharge recombination must originate from TTA. This is\nfurther supported by the fact that, as the bias voltage is\nincreased from 7 to 12 V (keeping the bias offset voltage\nconstant at 0 V), the EL intensities of Ph and DF obey a\nIDF\u0006I\n1:4\nPh dependency over the entire bias voltage range\n(figure not shown). This superlinear dependence of DF\nintensity on Ph intensity strongly indicates that TTA is\nresponsible for the observed DF. Earlier, from PL mea-\nsurements, several authors reported similar dependence\nof DF intensity on Ph intensity based on the excitation\nenergy dependence and suggested TTA to be responsible\nfor the DF observed upon photoexcitation [6,7].\nThe decrease in Ph intensity with an increase in re-\nverse bias offset voltage (Fig. 2) seems to be due to the\nquenching of triplet population by charge carriers. It is\nwell known that under the application of a bias voltage a\nfraction of the injected charge carriers is trapped near the\ninterface regions of the polymer layer and the electrodes\nleading to accumulation of space charge and thus to local\nchanges of the internal electric field [8\u201310,21\u201323]. Pinner\net al. [8] reported that the trapped charge carriers give\nrise to a sharp discharging current spike (of the order of\n\u0001s) after the device is turned off. In fact, we observed a\nweak short-lived DF (of the order of \u0001s) in polyfluorene\nbased devices, which can be detected at 28 K as well as at\n292 K (no electrophosphorescence can be detected at\n292 K). The short-lived DF grows in intensity as the\ntemperature is increased from 28 to 292 K and is attrib-\nuted to the space charge effect, the details of which will\nbe discussed in a separate communication. However, it is\nnoteworthy that the short-lived DF signal is found to be\nquenched significantly under the application of a reverse\nbias offset voltage. This indicates that a part of the\ntrapped charge carriers is swept out to the respective\nelectrodes in the presence of a reverse bias offset voltage\nafter the device is switched off. While moving to the\nrespective electrodes, some of these charge carriers\nquench the triplet population, thereby quenching Ph in-\ntensity and subsequently DF intensity, to some extent\ndepending on the magnitude of the reverse bias offset\nvoltage. This kind of triplet exciton quenching by charge\ncarriers has been extensively studied in molecular crys-\ntals [24] and is expected to play a significant role on the\ntriplet population in PLEDs. However, little information\nis available about this process in conjugated polymers\nbecause of the lack of experimental data. Our observa-\ntions indicate that triplet exciton quenching by charge\ncarriers is indeed an important process in devices based\non conjugated polymers and, hence, must be taken into\naccount while determining the ratio of singlet to triplet\npopulation in working PLEDs accurately.\nAt delay times <30 ms, the DF intensity decays in a\npower law fashion, IDF\u0006tm (inset of Fig. 3). In integrated\nkinetics, the value of m is found to be\u00010:2 at delay times\n<3 ms and approaches a value of \u00010:5 for delay times\nexceeding 3 ms. So, in real kinetics the value of m varies\nfrom\u00011:2 to\u00011:5 in the respective time domains. Hertel\net al. [6] observed similar behavior for the decay kinetics\nof DF in the same delay time region upon photoexcita-\ntion, although the values of m observed in the present\nwork are somewhat lower than those reported by them. At\ndelay times > 60 ms, the Ph as well as the DF exhibit a\nmonoexponential decay as shown in Fig. 3. This is a true\ndifferentiated kinetics as the channel width of the detec-\ntion (40 ms) is much shorter than the applied delay times.\nThe lifetimes of Ph and DF are found to be 217 and 97 ms,\nrespectively. Thus, the decay time of DF is almost half of\nthat of Ph indicating that the phenomenology regarding\nPh and DF is the same. This again confirms that the DF\nobserved upon charge recombination originates from\nTTA. Our results are basically similar to the decay ki-\nnetics of Ph and DF earlier observed by several authors\nfrom PL measurements [6,7]. However, these authors\nreported much longer lifetimes for Ph as well as DF.\nFinally, the reverse bias offset voltage is found not to\naffect the decay kinetics of either Ph or DF observed in\nthe ms time domain.

We also observed a\ndelayed fluorescence at long delay times (of the order of\nms). From bias offset voltage dependence of the EL\nintensities of Ph and DF, it is concluded that the DF\noriginates from TTA. Superlinear dependence of the DF\nintensity on Ph intensity, obtained by increasing the bias\nvoltage, again confirms that TTA is responsible for the\nobserved DF. At delay times <30 ms, the DF decays in a\npower law fashion with an exponent value of \u00011:5. Both\nPh and DF decay monoexponentially at long delay times\n(>60 ms) with lifetimes of 217 and 97 ms, respectively,\nindicating that the DF is generated via TTA. However, the\ndecay kinetics of electrically induced Ph and DF are\nfound to be somewhat different from those observed ear-\nlier by PL measurements. A fast (submicrosecond) triplet\nexciton quenching by charge carriers is found to occur\nvery efficiently in the PLEDs, and this quenching process\nmust be taken into account while determining the ratio of\nsinglet to triplet population in working devices accurately.\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for funding (GR\/\nM86040 and GR\/R19687).
