This can be \nachieved by either increasing customer numbers (assuming average revenues per \ncustomers (ARPU) does not decline) or through increasing the usage that existing \ncustomers\u2019 make of their mobile devices. The former is becoming increasingly \ndifficult as penetration rates for mobile phones reach saturation.\n1\n While attracting \ncustomer from competing operators is a possibility, competitors too are looking to \nattract customers in a similar fashion, and the practice eventually becoming a zero-\nsum game. The latter will require enticing subscribers to make greater use of their \nmobile device through availing of content and services in addition to voice. These so \ncalled \u2018data services\u2019 are seen as where the potential for growth lies. However, the \nnature of these services as well as winning business models is still open to \nspeculation. And, of course, incumbents will not have it all their own way with new \nentrants and mobile virtual networks operators (MVNOs) likely to provide stiff \ncompetition. New technologies like Wi-Fi\n2\n, WiMax\n3\n, IMS\n4\n and broadcasting \ntechnologies will also have a disruptive impact on the current ecosystem for mobile \noperators and mobile service providers. \n \nThe Internet has shown the way to commercialise digital content and in the provision \nof services.  However, despite the existence of WAP\n5\n, most access to the Internet is \nstill through either fixed lines or wireless WiFi hotspots. In the future, handheld \nmobile devices connected to telecommunications networks are predicted to become a \ncritical way to gain access to the increasing amounts of content now in digital format \nas well as avail of services and applications. What is becoming clear is that mobile \noperators are unlikely to develop and manage all these services. Content and services \nare likely to be provided by a myriad of third party organisations ranging from the \nlarge media conglomerates such as Disney, NBC and Sony to global and regional \nbanks to smaller \u201ccottage\u201d industry companies like iTouch, Index, Monstermob, Zed \nand Jamba.  \n \nMobile operators are today in a key position as they \u201cown\u201d the mobile delivery \nchannel as well as relationships with customers. This monopolistic position however \ncan also make them complacent. It similarly can stifle strategic thinking and \ninnovation. Of course, mobile operators don\u2019t want to end up like Internet service \nproviders (ISPs); while providing the access point to the fixed Internet many have \nbeen unable to appropriate the value that is proportional to their privileged position. \nOnly a small percentage of ISPs are profitable today, a situation defined by the fact \nthat: barriers to entry are low, the cost of acquiring customers is high, switching costs \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 3 \nare low, competition is based on price, and in most cases ISP\u2019s don\u2019t have any \nrelationship with their customers.  To reap rewards, operators must maintain their \ncurrent privileged position yet provoke innovation in the kind of products and services \nthat will create value for customers and thus lead to continued revenue growth. \n \nTo maintain this position, operators have sought to develop \u201cwalled garden\u201d portals to \nensure that content creators are kept well away from end-customers. This strategy has \nmade it difficult for content providers to easily connect up to operator networks in \norder to make their content available and those that do are also unhappy with the \nrevenue-sharing arrangements.\n6\n This practice is based on the old conception of the \nvalue chain with its value creating logic as a linked chain of activities, a perspective \nthat leads to the development of strategies focused on controlling the chain. Indeed, \nfixed wireline operators owned the entire value chain. With the digitisation of both \ncontent and the value chain this logic is inappropriate and requires a fresh perspective \nthat recognises co-operative relationships and alliances. Mobile telecom operators \nmust also redraw their IT architecture if they hope to market new services quickly and \ncheaply.\n7\n Many have begun to implement service delivery platforms (SDPs) to \nfacilitate the provision of new and innovative content from 3\nrd\n party providers, \nhowever the overall logic guiding these initiatives is based on old conceptions of \nvalue creation and the value chain logic. This raises the issue of developing software \nframeworks to assist the establishment of inter-organizational relationships where the \nfocus is not just on facilitating data exchange but also different business models and \nbilateral service level agreements. \n \nThis paper offers an alternative perspective on how managers can shape strategy and \ndevise business models in order to capture and leverage opportunities in digital \ncompetitive spaces. In particular, it focuses on the provision of innovative content and \nservices to customers through mobile devices. After a brief introduction to the mobile \ncontent and services ecosystems it highlights the challenging of leveraging value \nthrough the transmission network.  The value network concept is then introduced and \nthe process of network value analysis (NVA) is described. The provision of \ninnovative mobile content and services is then explored using value network analysis \nand some implication for mobile service operators and mobile service providers \ndeveloped. The paper concludes by exploring the implication of the value network \nlogic for the development of software systems for the networked economy. \n \n \nEvolution of the mobile services ecosystem \n \nThe mobile ecosystem (the development and provision of voice and data services) is \nrelatively new.\n8\n The technical foundation for the current mobile data transmission \nsystem was laid down in the early 1990s, with the introduction of GSM\n9\n as a standard \nin many parts of the world.\n10\n With GSM networks customers pay for the time \nconnected rather than the amount of data transferred. Newer networks based on \nGPRS\n11\n technology are package switched, which means that users are constantly \nconnected but only pay for the amount of data transmitted. The transition to GPRS \nfrom GSM is possible with fairly limited investment, no more than an upgrading of \nthe network. UMTS\n12\n, or 3G, offers improved speeds as well as more efficient use of \nfrequency space. However, it requires new investment and deployment of new \ntechnical infrastructures. \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 4 \n \nThe mobile phone is now more than just a functional piece of technology to connect \nup to mobile transmission networks. It doesn\u2019t merely replace the land line: it is a \nfashion item that has become an indispensable device for managing emails to contacts \nto diaries. It also provides the access capability for many different types of content \nand services, such as financial transactions, entertainment, and gambling. In the \nbusiness-to-business (B2B) domain, it can provide access to corporate applications, \nsuch as customer relationship management and task scheduling. Personalisation, \ncommunication, positioning and immediacy are the cornerstone of the mobile \nmarketplace for consumers.\n13\n With handset positioning capability, for example, \ncustomers can get answer to questions such as \u201cWhere is the nearest restaurant?\u201d or \n\u201cHow do I get to the main train station?\u201d\n14\n  \n \nOver last decades, deregulation, internationalisation and technology innovation have \ndramatically changed the face of the European telecommunications industry.\n15\n To \ncope with these powerful forces, incumbent telecommunication operators have had to \nstrategically renew their companies and develop new competencies, particularly to \ncompete with mobile services. These shifts also demand a change in managerial \nmindsets. For the tradition telecom operator (PTT) this transition has not been easy \nand many have struggled; Figure 1 captures the transition that has been necessary \nacross a number of key dimensions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 1 From monopoly to competition: challenges facing traditional telecom \noperators as they enter mobile space. \n \nFrom the exuberance of youth, the mobile industry is now showing signs of maturing. \nFigure 2 presents the major shifts that this maturation has caused among incumbent \noperators. Service providers no longer look on customers as engaging in transactions, \ngenerating revenue through network usage. Even the word \u201csubscriber\u201d has \nconnotations of subscribing to use the transmission network, and has its legacy in \nfixed wire-line voice services. Service providers now seek to develop closer \nrelationships with their customer base. The early practice among operators was to \npush services at customers. Today, the focus is on better understanding customers and \ntheir preferences, and segmenting the customer base, focusing on providing \ndifferentiating offerings. Indeed, in the early days, network operators competed with \nMonopoly \nTelecom\nOperator\nCompetitive Telecom\nOperator\nConnection\nInstalling\ninfrastructure\nCharacteristic\nEconomy\nof scale\nCost\nrecovery\nUniversal\nservice\nMarket\npricing\nShareholder\nvalue\nRevenue\/\ncustomer\nLaunching\nProducts\nCustomer\nbase\nCompetitive\nadvantage\nCore\ncompetence\nPerformance\nmeasure\nPricing\napproach\nCorporate\nobjective\nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 5 \neach other to attract customers; the value of the network increases with number of \ncustomers.\n16\n Today, the focus is on customer retention. Indeed, average revenue per \nuser (ARPU), a key metric in the early days has been replaced by average profit per \nuser (APU). At the origins of the industry, operators focused on investing in \ninfrastructure, building and rolling out transmission networks and broadening \ncoverage. The key today is to leverage key assets, such as billing, messaging, \nlocation, presence, etc. And, just when operators were considering 3G TV and video \nservices, phones with television receivers that let broadcasters bypass mobile \nnetworks and transmit programs straight to handsets have begun to appear.\n17\n \n \nOne key shift is that from a focus on technology, particular stressing the advantages of \ndigital over analogue, to content and services. It is the take-up of these services that \nwill drive network traffic. Yet, incumbent operators equally recognise that in the \nfuture significant value will not be created through the transmission of digital \u2018bits\u2019. \nIndeed, it has been said that transporting bits is an even worse business to be in than \nthat of airlines with their fare wars!\n18\n The cost of sending data across a network is \nbased on the amount transmitted not connection time or distance. Value, rather than \npure cost is what is important and should be a key driver in the construction of any \ncompetitive strategy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2 Shifts in the attitude of mobile service providers. \n \nWith traditional networks in organisations (such as LANs and WANs) the cost of \nusing the network is based on capacity not volume of data transmitted. However, \nwhere data is delivered over a wireless connection, every bit of data transmitted has a \ncost. So a financial trader will value the timely collection of bits describing a market \nmovement far more highly than a multiple megabit picture. Since wireless spectrum \nresources are limited and more precious than cables or fibre in the ground, mobile \noperators have to manage the cost of each bit transmitted versus the revenue gained. If \nan operator is just a \u2018bit pipe\u2019 utility provider, delivering and charging for simple raw \ndata, this places a greater onus on the user to manage their use of the actual services \ncarried. \n \nThe traditional mobile service provider, while also the operator of the network \ntransmission infrastructure through ownership of the licence spectrum, may not \nnecessarily be so in the future.

This practice \nprovides new delivery channels for leveraging brands of non-telecommunications \norganisations, enabling relationships with their customers to be enhanced. We have \nalso witnessed a new type of service provider utilising the services of mobile virtual \nnetwork enablers (MVNE), facilitating these providers to deliver services without any \ntelecoms operational expertise. \n \nThe challenge of combining IT, data and applications with mobile access creates a \nservice delivery opportunity; integrating the commercial considerations of customer \nservice levels, multiple provider billing and international relationships with the \ntechnology challenges of complex data over transient connections. This moves the \nargument from one of the cost of supplying a commodity to one of value, service \ndelivery and solution provision.  \n \n \nFrom value chain to value network \n \nThe value chain as both a concept and tool has been used for the last 30 years to \nunderstand and analyse industries.\n19\n It has proved a very useful mechanism for \nportraying the chained linkage of activities that exist in the physical world within \ntraditional industries, particularly manufacturing. Furthermore, it has also framed our \nthinking about value and value creation. However, as products and services become \ndematerialised and the value chain itself no longer having a physical dimension, the \nvalue chain concept becomes in an inappropriate device with which to analyse many \nindustries today and uncover sources of value.\n20\n This is particularly evident in sectors \nsuch as banking, insurance, telecommunications, news, entertainment, music, \nadvertising, and certain areas of the public sector.\n21\n In addition, many industries now \nexhibit strong co-operative behaviour\n22\n with inter-firm relationships playing a \nsignificant role in strategic performance.\n23\n The focal of the value chain is the end \nproduct and the chain is designed around the activities required to produce it. The \nlogic being that every company occupies a position in the chain; upstream suppliers \nprovide inputs before passing them downstream to the next link in the chain, the \ncustomer. With the vale network concept, value is co-created by a combination of \nplayers in the network. \n \nThe competitive realities of the \u201cnetwork economy\u201d require that we rethink traditional \nmethods for analysing competitive environments. The old linear models do not \naccount for the nature of alliances, competitors, complementors and other members in \nbusiness networks. Traditionally, strategists use the value chain to analyse the firm \nand its major competitors and to identify gaps between firm performance and a \ncompetitor\u2019s performance. Once the gaps are known, the strategist can make and \nimplement plans to close them. This is a valuable exercise, particularly in the \n\u2018physical\u2019 world typified by manufacturing firms. Strategy becomes primarily the art \nof positioning a firm in the right place on the value chain.\n24\n Figure 3 illustrates a value \nchain perspective of the mobile network operator. \n \nAdopting a contrasting network approach, organisations focus not on the company or \nthe industry, but the value-creating system itself, within which different economic \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 7 \nactors \u2013 supplier, partners, allies, and customers \u2013 work together to co-produce value. \nWhere once individual firm battled against each other, today the war is waged \nbetween networks of interconnected organisations. Leaders must view the health and \nwell being of their network and the individual partners that compose it to be as \nimportant as their own company\u2019s.\n25\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 3 The traditional industry value chain view of the mobile network operator: \nVodafone and Orange. \n \nValue networks are composed of complementary node and links.\n26\n The crucial \ndefining feature of networks is the complementarity between the various nodes and \nlinks. A service delivered over a network requires the use of two or more network \ncomponents. Think of value networks as a set of relatively autonomous units that can \nbe managed independently, but operate together in a framework of common principles \nand service level agreements (SLAs). Firms in the network are independent; otherwise \nthey would fall into a case of \u2018vertical quasi-integration\u2019.\n27\n However, the relationships \nenjoyed by the firms in the network are essential to their competitive positions. The \nstructure of the network plays an important role in firm performance and in industry \nevolution.\n28\n  \n \nTransaction cost analysis\n29\n provides a way of understanding the impact of new \ninformation and communication technologies and why transformations take place \nwithin industries. According to this theory, an organisation has two options for \norganising its activities: an internal hierarchical structure that integrates activities into \nits managerial structure, or a market relationship with external firms.\n30\n Market \ntransactions support coordination between multiple buyers and sellers, and \nhierarchical transactions that support coordination within the firm.\n31\n  Digitisation is \nsignificantly altering the cost structure of firms such that the cost of transactions, both \nwithin and between organisations, is dramatically declining.\n32\n Thus, many of the \nbenefits associated with integrated firms (i.e. hierarchy), which primarily arise from \ntheir lower transaction costs, are eliminated. This can be seen right across traditional \nindustries with fragmentation of traditional value chains from banking to automotive \nmanufacturing.\n33\n It is also leading to the emergence of the so called virtual \norganisation.\n34\n  \n \nAnalysis suggests that the present integrated mobile telecommunications company is \nnot sustainable and that companies may need to deconstruct around one of three \nNetwork \nequipment and \nspectrum\nInfrastructure \nand operations\nBilling Retail \ndistribution\nPortals and \nresellers\/\nMVNOs\nVodafone\nOrange\n\u202299% population \ncoverage\n\u20221,800hMz\n\u2022In-house \u2022Own billing \nsystem\n\u2022Own branded and \nother retail chains\n\u2022Distribution\n\u2022Own portal\n\u2022Centrica\n\u202299% population \ncoverage\n\u20221,800hMz\n\u2022In-house \u2022Own billing \nsystem\n\u2022Own branded \nretail chains\n\u2022Other retailers\n\u2022Distributors\n\u2022Own portal\nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 8 \nfunctions, unless clear strategic benefits can be identified and pursued by keeping \nthese functions within the same organisation:\n35\n \n \n\u2022 Customer relationship business, where competitive advantages come from \neconomies of scope, with each customer treated as an individual. \n\u2022 Service and content innovation and commercialisation businesses, where the \nfocus is on new innovations and on the speed-to-market for new content and \nservices. \n\u2022 Infrastructure management businesses, providing network access and \nmediating capability, where economies of scale dominate the management \nphilosophy. \n \nIn contrast to the value chain logic, these functions are performed simultaneous rather \nthan sequentially, and mutual adjustments are required with respect to network scope, \ncapacity and the technical properties of the concurrent services.\n36\n  \n \nCurrently, most mobile operators, particularly the main players, manage these \nfunctions under the same organisational roof. But this can have implications, for \nexample, the ability to offer innovative products to customers may be limited by the \nunderlying technological characteristics of the core network or by the need to avoid \ncannibalising the organisation\u2019s own sales in other divisions.\n37\n The separation of the \nthree functions is beginning to be seen in the industry, for example MVNOs focusing \non managing a brand\u2019s relationship with the customer.\n38\n \n \nWhile integrated companies do have many long term strategic advantages\n39\n, over time \nthe specialised, focused and relatively \u2018simple\u2019 organisation that emerge from this \ndeconstruction will not remain static. Instead, these companies will become more \ncomplex as they develop expertise in other areas, albeit on a smaller scale than \npreviously, and with different emphasis as well. An infrastructure provider will, for \nexample, require expertise in customer management, as well as product innovation \nand commercialisation to identify, establish, and then manage the new business \nrelationships that it establishes. However, potential conflicts will again emerge \nbetween different functions. The grouping of expertise within organisations will not \nbe the same as before; it will differ depending on what part of the telecommunications \nindustry the organisation is located in, and the business model it has chosen to \ndevelop. This fragmentation results in a radical deconstruction of the industry where \ncomplex relationships will need to be formed between different players in order to \ndeliver services to end customers. These can be represented by a network of \nconnected entities: the value network. \n \nIn analysing a network as opposed to a chain, we are essentially asking the same \nquestion as with value chain analysis: \u201cHow is value created?\u201d The traditional answer \nto this question is \u201cThrough the value chain\u201d. However, in the networked economy as \nfirms move increasingly to a virtual marketspace\n40\n, traditional analytical tools fail to \nidentify the true sources of value. The key to value creation in the networked \neconomy lies in understanding how value is created in relationships.\n41\n From a network \nperspective relationships are viewed as part of a larger whole \u2013 a network of \ninterdependent relationships.\n42\n These relationships are \u2018connected\u2019 since what \nhappens in one relationship affects positively or negatively in others.  \n \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 9 \nWe must therefore extend any analysis away from viewing value creation from the \nperspective of an organisation as an isolated unit to looking at how the organisation \ncreates value within the context of the network. It is this network of relationships that \nprovides the key to understanding the competitive environment in the network \neconomy. Consider Intel developing a new microprocessor. The success of this chip \ndepends on software developers writing applications that leverage the new processing \ncapability; hardware manufacturers must build systems that can accommodate the \nnew chip, including any additional cooling requirements; and new bus architectures \nmay also need to be designed. This ecosystem must be cultivated. \n \nOne of the most important aspects of the networked economy is its dynamic nature. \nAn action by one participant in the network can influence other network members. Or \nan action by one participant may require further actions by other participants to be \neffective. This can have broad implications. It is no longer enough to think of a firm \nas a member of a closed system subject to uncontrollable outside shocks. It is actually \npart of a network that produces its own change. Thus, in analysing the network all \naspects of the network must be included: customers, suppliers, competitors, allies, \nregulators, complementors and any other network players whose presence in the \nnetwork can influence value creation of the firm. \n \nBy understanding a firm\u2019s relationships with other network members, strategists can \nbetter understand the following: \n \n\u2022 Where value lies in the network and how value is co-created \n\u2022 How the firm\u2019s activities will affect the network and  \n\u2022 How other members are likely to respond. \n \nAs a result, analysing a network places all the elements of a network in their proper \ncontext and becomes the guiding force for determining how a networked economy \nbusiness model should be improved or developed. Taking a network view of a mobile \noperator and rather than merely asking \u201chow can the operator add value to its \ncustomers?\u201d we ask \u201cHow can the operator add value to the other members of the \nnetwork?\u201d In so doing, we begin to understand not only the direct relationships \nbetween operators and customers, but also the interrelationships between all the other \nmembers of the network \u2013 a much more complex issue! \n \n \nFoundations of Network Value Analysis (NVA) \n \nThe development of any set of propositions around new business models in the \nevolving networked economy must be based on underlying theoretical perspectives. \nTraditionally, linking up businesses to form networks has been the object of numerous \ninvestigations in the fields of economics, sociology and informatics.\n43\n These \ninvestigations describe network phenomena as very abstract approaches to network \nclassification and structure.\n44\n However, neither transaction cost theory\n45\n, network \ntheory\n46\n, network economics\n47\n nor any other of the theories examined provide support \nin answering practical questions with strategy formulation.  \n \nFrom our research, we have developed an approach that we call Network Value \nAnalysis (NVA). With NVA, the aim is to generate a comprehensive description of \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 10 \nwhere value lies in a network and how value is created. Box 1 illustrates the stages in \nundertaking such an analysis. The first step involves defining the network objectives \nand setting the boundaries of the analysis. We can conceive a network as an imaginary \nconstruct invented to connect together a set of relationships between entities where \nlinkages (e.g. interactions, influences and relationships) already exist. Using this \nperspective, networks are essentially mental constructions of what we \u201csee\u201d connected \nin reality.  \n \nThe network should contain roles or functions as nodes not specific organisation \nnames. Organisational boundaries can subsequently be constructed around these \nfunctions. For example, in constructing the network for the mobile content and \nservices ecosystem, we have separate nodes for transmission network operation and \nservice provision and not specify particular organisations such as Vodafone, TIM or \n02. With \nMVNOs, for \nexample, we have \na breed of service \nprovider now \nproviding voice \nand data services \nbut not operating \ntheir own \ntransmission \nnetwork.  \n \nThrough analysis of the network, it aids in addressing the issues faced when designing \nstrategy. These include: \n \n\u2022 What roles (or groups of players) are benefiting most in the new \nconfiguration? \n\u2013 Multiple new roles \n\u2013 Roles differ depending on service \n\u2013 Roles likely to be disaggregated \n\u2013 Roles could be played by multiple players within a single offering \n \n\u2022 Different business logics for different players (depending on their roles in the \nnew network) \n\u2013 What are the key resources they need to have? \n\u2013 What are the key activities they need to do? \n\u2013 What are the key cost and value drivers?  \n \n\u2022 Different players require different business logic \n\u2013 Where are you best placed to play? \n\u2013 What are your key strengths and how can they be leveraged in this new \nspace?  \n\u2013 Where will competitors have advantages over you?   \n \n\u2022 New business models \nBOX 1. Network Value Analysis \n \n1. Define the network \n2. Identify and define network entities \n3. Define the value each entity perceives from being a \nnetwork member. \n4. Identify and map network influences. \n5. Analyse and shape. \n \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 11 \n\u2013 Could you build the resources and capabilities required to compete in \nthe chosen role?  \n\u2013 Which ones are appropriate for each player? \n \nStep 1: Define network objectives.  \n \nWith NVA, the aim is to generate a comprehensive description of where value lies in \na network. The first step involves defining the network or setting the boundaries of \nanalysis. This will be from the perspective of the network focal. The network focal is \nthe organisation or business unit (economic units such as corporations, divisions profit \ncentres, and small and medium sized enterprises) whose business model relies on the \nnetwork under consideration.  \n \nStep 2: Identifying and defining network participants \n \nIdentifying network participants requires taking the standpoint of the network focal \nand identifying all actors that influence the value the network focal delivers its end-\ncustomers. We can define the network as consisting of all those actors or communities \nof people that exist in the network focal\u2019s current network environment that have a \ndirect influence on, or are affected by, its value propositions towards customers. \nDepending on the network objectives, these can include designers, suppliers, \ncompetitors, channels, regulators, technology vendors, and software suppliers.  \n \nStep 3: Identifying value dimensions of the network participants \n \nDelivering value requires a clear understanding of exactly what kind of value is \ndesired by network members. Simply, value is as they perceive it, so every \norganisation must find ways to draw out from network members how they see value \u2013 \nnow and in the future. This is why planning a value delivery strategy by \u201cidentifying \nthe value\u201d for all participants is so important.\n48\n The objective is to capture the \nperceived value of the different participants in regard to being part of the extended \nnetwork. \n \nPerceived value concerns implicit beliefs that guide behaviour\n49\n and this step involves \ninvestigating why members are part of the network. It is worth mentioning here that \nalthough we tend to refer to perceived value in a positive sense (e.g. the entertainment \npleasure a user perceives through Internet gaming) this step also involves capturing \nthe perceived inconveniences (or detriments) the participants perceive due to being \npart of the extended network (participants can be both voluntarily and involuntarily \ninvolved in the network). In a way, these detriments can be thought of as negative \nvalue dimensions as they destroy\/reduce value for the participant. Although simple in \nconcept, the mere recognition that the perceived benefits (and perceived \ninconveniences or detriments) of network members diverge is an important step \ntoward the network focal \u2018managing\u2019 the participants as it is identifying and \nclassifying those benefits and detriments. \n \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 12 \nIdentifying the value dimensions of the network participants involves asking, \u201cWhat \nare they getting out of the network?\u201d As opposed to traditional activity analyses of \nfirms and behavioural analyses concerning individuals, investigating the perceived \npositive and negative value dimensions of network participants proves to be more \nadvantageous when studying opportunity networks. Opportunity networks represent \nemerging networks \u2013 no one knows what they will look like in the future. The only \nway to analyse them is to assess the forces that are shaping such networks. Perceived \nvalue is a key driver of behaviour which in turn is a key force of network \ndevelopment. In a way, perceived values envisage a network member\u2019s highest level \nof steering toward influencing network development \u2013 it is the perceived values that \nsteer what people and firms are willing to do and not do.  \n \nStep 4: Define value linkages \n \nThis step involves identifying the nature of linkages between the members of the \nextended network. As linkages between members can take several forms (e.g. \nfinancial control, affection, dependency for content etc.) we only consider those that \nfeed the value dimensions identified for all network participants in the previous step. \nMore specifically, we call these linkages network influences. Identifying network \ninfluences is important for NVA, as the level of influence is an important indicator of \nthe amount of attention providers will need to give to that network participant when \ndeveloping its business model. \n \nA network influence is any linkage that influences or impacts the perceived value \ndimensions and\/or behaviour of a network participant. Influences on a network \nparticipant\u2019s behaviour are included in the analysis as behaviour is very closely \nrelated (and dependent) on the value a participant perceives from the network. As a \nguide, suffice it is to say that perceived value concerns implicit beliefs and it is these \nbeliefs that guide behaviour.  \n \nInfluences are a manifestation of linkages between network members and concern \nwhat flows in the network \u2013 that is, what is carried or exchanged in the network. The \ndifferent types of influences can be categorized as follows:\n50\n  \n \n(1) Exchange of goods and services; for example, new content. \n(2) Affective and liking (expressive\/emotional); for example, customers attracted \nto a brand. \n(3) Information and ideas (cognitive); for example, ideas for new service offerings \ncoming from customers, content developers or market research companies. \n(4) Influence and power (prescriptive); for example, regulators. \n \nNetwork influences can be direct or indirect depending on whose perspective one \ntakes. With NVA, we take the perspective of the network focal with respect to its \nobjectives and offerings towards its customers. Only those influences that have an \nexplicit affect on their business are considered.  \n \nInfluences can be positive or negative with respect to the value dimensions and\/or \nbehaviour of the participant that is affected. Perceptions are used, as whether real or \nimaginary is not the issue as long as it is perceived to be a threat it has a negative \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 13 \ninfluence with respect to their value dimensions. An influence can be considered as \nnetwork critical if (a) the provider network currently depends on this linkage to create \nvalue for the users and\/or (b) the influence can alter the current network significantly \nif no action is undertaken in respect of this influence.  \n \nStep 5: Analyse and shape \n \nThe network value map provides an overview of the network and thus allows some \nquick conclusions to be drawn as it relates to the roles of the different participants in \nthe network and analyse scenarios in terms of effects on the network of discrete \nevents. The key to this analysis is a thorough understanding of the value dimensions \nof all participants and how they are influenced by other participants. End customers \nare typically the key to value creation in this network.  \n \nA map is by definition static \u2013 a snap shot in time \u2013 whereas the environment, and in \nparticular in a network, is dynamic. In addition to the analysis of the static map, we \ntherefore need to add another layer of analysis examining the behaviour of the \nnetwork. This entails describing some relevant network effects and features of \ndifferent types of networks. Any analysis typically covers the following: \n \n\u2022 Identification of the different roles of the participants in the network \n\u2022 Analysis of the value dimensions of the users \n\u2022 Analysis of the network dynamics in play and their implications in future \nscenarios \n\u2022 Challenges that can be extracted from the analysis.  \n \n \nMobile content\/service innovation and provision \n \nTo illustrate network value analysis, we shall examine mobile content and service \ninnovation and its provisioning to customers.  It is widely established that content and \nservices will be the drivers of traffic through operator transmission networks. It is also \nacknowledged that operators themselves will not develop all of these services but that \nthey will be provided by third-party providers. Some of these will be large \nconglomerate media organisations; others will be smaller start-ups companies or \naggregators. The \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approaches, where only content from selected \nproviders is made available from an operator portal is acknowledged as being no \nlonger appropriate: customers want choice. This has implications for operators and \ntheir competitive behaviour. \n \nThus, network participants include MVNO, network operators, content aggregators, \ncontent\/service creators, browsers developers, infrastructure equipment, marketing \ncompanies, regulators, etc. \n \nCurrently, the process to physically connect up new 3\nrd\n parties content and service \ncreators takes up considerable time and can be a costly exercise. Often connecting up \neach creator or aggregator is a significant systems integration project. Initial \nnegotiations, agreeing business model and defining appropriate service level \nagreement all take time, and operators could potentially have 1000\u2019s of content \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 14 \nproviders. Consequently, the time-to-market for new services is such that commercial \nopportunities can be lost due to long lead times; many services can have short \nlifecycles, for example, content based around a new movie or a marketing campaign \nfor a consumer product. For the operator, the cost of 3\nrd\n party management can be \noverly complex and excessive.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 4 Partial network value map for mobile content. \n \nFigure 5 illustrates schematically the network relationship between content and \nservice creators and a network operator. It outlines what the 3\nrd\n party provider is \nseeking from the relationship, and thus membership of the overall network. These \ninclude a process that facilities easy sign-up and negotiation, easier connection to \nphysical network, quick time to market for their offerings, more control over service \nlifecycle and quick settlement. The operator also has particular requirements driven \nby their need to offer customers a broader service portfolio: seeking low risk so that \ntheir brand is not compromised, greater control over network assets, shorter time to \nenrol new third parties, robust business processes and support for different business \nmodels and revenue distribution schemes.  \n \nWe cannot forget the customer from analysis as the customer ultimately defines value. \nAs a member of the network, the customer is not interested in the complexity of the IT \nsystems or transmission network. Equally, customers do not want to be concerned \nwith the revenue sharing agreement between content provider and network operator. \nThe customer is seeking choice, service quality, relevance, ease of use, fair and easily \nunderstood pricing as well as good support, if required.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContent\/service\nCreator\nPortal\nWeb\nContent\naggregators\nOS\nDevice\nBrowser\nBilling\nHosting\nService\nProvider\nLocationInfrastructure\nEquipment\nMessaging\nJava\nBrands\nMarketing cos\nNetwork\noperator Personalisation\nRegulators\nRing\ntones\nPayment\nASP\nSoftware\nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 5 Business drivers for service level agreements (SLAs) between Operator and \ncontent and service providers (Source: Mobile Cohesion, 2005). \n \nReducing the time-to-market for new content and services has significant benefits for \nboth the creator and the operator (see Figure 6). Content becomes profitable within a \nshorter space of time. Short lifespan services, such as those associated with particular \nbrand promotions, also become economically feasible. For the marketers, it now \npermits more granular segmentation of the market, with content focused on the \nparticular demographic of the customer. This enables operators to increase its content \nand services portfolio, thereby driving revenue growth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 6 Pushing back the breakeven point: more services, more customers, more \nrevenue. \n \nThis figure also illustrates the theory of the Long Tail. This emerging thesis asserts \nthat if customers have infinite choice, they will gravitate towards niches because they \nsatisfy narrow interests better.\n51\n We are already witnessing this phenomenon in areas \nsuch as music and book retailing. For example, more than half of Amazon\u2019s book \nsales come from outside its top 130,000 titles; this is more than most bookstores will \ntypically stock in a physical book store.\n52\n Rhapsody streams more songs each month \nbeyond its top 10,000 than it does its top 10,000. \npenetration\nrevenues\nHigh\nLow\n0 %\nvoice\nsms\nring-tones\/logosservices for narrow\ncustomer segments\nor with short life-spans\nbreak-even level\nNetwork Operator\nI need:\n\u2022 An easy sign-up \nprocess\n\u2022 Simpler physical \nconnection to \nnetwork\n\u2022 Shorter time-to-\nmarket\n\u2022 Lower cost\n\u2022 Good management \nreporting\n\u2022 Control of service \nlifecycle\n\u2022 Quick settlement\nContent and \nservice creators\nI need:\n\u2022 Low risk\n\u2022 Control of network \nassets\n\u2022 Increased ARPU\n\u2022 Broader service \nportfolio\n\u2022 Cost reduction in \ndealing with 3rd parties\n\u2022 Shorter time to enrol \nnew 3rd parties\n\u2022 Good business \nprocesses\n\u2022 Different business \nmodels\nOperator \nNetwork, IT \nand Business \nProcesses\n3rd Party\nIT and \nBusiness \nProcesses\nService Level Agreement\nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 16 \n \nThe key factor that determines whether a sales distribution has a long tail is the total \ncost of inventory storage and distribution; when insignificant, as it is with digital \nservices and distribution channel, it becomes economically viable to target many \nsmall market segments. This might be content specifically for a football team, a \ncompany, or a school. Services and content that may have low volumes can \ncollectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few \u2018big hits\u2019 \nif distribution channel is large enough. \n \n \nInsights for mobile operators  \n \nSo what insights can we glean from analysing the mobile content and service \necosystem from a network perspective? What is clear is that operators cannot expect \nto go it alone if they are to provide the kind of content and range or services that \ncustomers will increasingly demand. They will be forced to cooperate and partner \nwith a range of content and service providers from the large media conglomerates and \naggregators to smaller content creators. This requires that network operators embrace \nthe value network concept and its implications. \n \nDriven by the value chain logic, the large European and US mobile operators have \nfocussed on \u201ccontent ownership\u201d or deployed \u201ccontent control\u201d strategies. They also \nwork with a small number of content owners and aggregators. The Long Tail thesis, \nhowever, means that the stranglehold of the big content providers over operators and \nservice providers can be diminished. These content providers typically provide the \n\u201cbig hits\u201d for distribution. However, by making available a wide variety of content \nfrom many different sources can be very profitable. Operators must shift their \nthinking from viewing connection to customers as a \u201cdumb pipe\u201d to a \u201csmart pipe\u201d in \norder to protect their privileged position on the value network and remain relevant. \nThis entails brokering out their key assets such as search, personalisation, device \nmanagement, and sophisticated charging to developers of content. \n \nAs value is ultimately defined by the customer, operators must base offerings around \nthe notion of value. They must move away from viewing the customer as \u201cmy \ncustomer\u201d to adopting a perspective of the customer as that which the network seeks \nto satisfy. This will demand significant mindset shifts in operator organizations that \nhave traditionally guarded closely their customers.  Focusing exclusively on the next \nnode in a value network can similarly be a mistake. Value networks are not \ncollections of partners delivering value to one other, based on requirements of next in \nline. \n \nOperators must explore new revenue sharing models. As one  content provider \nrecently noted \u201c[w]e find the standard 85%:15% revenue split for i-mode much more \nreasonable than the 60% we get from Vodafone live! Ironically, i-mode provider KPN \nnot only gives us more money than Vodafone does, but it also excels in technical and \nmarketing support.\u201d\n53\n  Those with more favourable models will attract more content \ncreators and thus increase the number of customers ultimately using the network.  \n \nInter-firm relationships facilitate the flow of knowledge and other resources \nthroughout the network. For example, this knowledge can be from customers \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 17 \nproviding information about their preferences or from content creators, perhaps a \nmedia organisation about to lunch a new movie. This flow of knowledge is crucial for \nthe sustainability of a network. For example, one European content provider recently \nnoted \u201c[w]e keep asking operators for more feedback on usage. But they are bad at \ndata mining and would rather keep the little information they have to themselves. \nWhy can\u2019t they understand that we need this data to improve products?\u201d\n54\n \n \nOf course, content and services that fail to meet the operator designated SLAs could \nhave a detrimental effect on the brand of the operator. For example, news services \ndelivering news late to customers or poor graphical presentation of a game can be \nperceived as the fault of the network operator. Operators must therefore continually \nmonitor the performance of providers using their network as well as the quality of \nservices being delivered.  \n \nNetworks do not remain stable but evolve over time. This evolution can be the result \nof particular events, for example competitor strategies, new technologies or regulatory \nevents, which change the structure and configuration of a network. Consider the \nimpact that Skype and Google are likely to have on the fixed-line voice transmission \nbusiness. Using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology, both have not only \nbecome members of this network but challenge the dominant position of traditional \nnational Telcos. WiMax, IMS and satellite technologies are poised to challenge the \n3G transmission networks of incumbent operators as are broadcasting companies and \nhandset manufacturers. \n \n \nValue networks and inter-organizational systems \n \nThe value network logic raises particular issues for the development of systems \nsupporting inter-organisational relationships. Traditionally technologies like \nelectronic data interchange (EDI) and more recently the Internet (via electronic \nmarketplaces) have been used to facilitate connectivity and integration of data and \ninformation from partner organisations using agreed standards. While the content or \nservice of the third-party can be embodied in an electronic form, other aspects of the \nrelationship are still conducted on a personal basis.  \n \nMost software today is designed based on value chain logic. This means that even if \ntwo companies seek to collaborate, with both using software from the same vendor, it \nis still considered a major systems integration (SI) task to physically and logically \nconnect up systems. In value networks, lengthy SI projects are not a viable option, or \nindeed appropriate. Furthermore, the focus of new inter-organizational systems should \nnot just be on exchanging information but also for facilitating the establishment of \ndifferent types of relationships as well as to manage the myriad of third party content \nproviders. For example, it is likely that operators will establish different service levels \nwith different content providers. It is also possible that different business models will \nunderpin each of these relationships. New software systems must facilitate all these \ntasks. Self-service portals to automate the process of collaboration are a likely way \nforward. \n \nOne way is to view the relationship between network parties at five levels: business \nmodel, management reporting and administration, business process, service level, and \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 18 \nnetwork. Each level defines a set or terms and conditions (or policy) relating to the \ndifferent dimensions of a partnership. Technology can support, and often automate, all \nfive levels.  \n \nThe network level is perhaps best understood and developed and where the focus of \nattention has been in developing inter-organizational systems. In the mobile eco-\nsystem, this level is concerned with facilitating the transmission of content through \nthe wireless network. New technologies like Internet-based web services\n55\n permit \noperators to leverage the key assets of their physical transmission network. They can \nexpose network capabilities, such as SMS, MMS, presence and location, making them \neasily available to content and service creators. This helps developers to create \ncontent more easily and speedily that takes advantage of the full capability of the \noperator network. \n \nThe traditional \u201csign-up\u201d process for prospective content providers can be long, \ncomplex and expensive. It typically entails initial meetings and presentations, \nfollowed by negotiations, perhaps due diligence, and ultimate agreements of business \nmodel and service levels. Given the large number of potential content providers an \noperator may work with this process can be resource intense. However, today, \ntechnology can automate most of the process involved in collaboration. One scenario \nmight be that through an operator portal potential providers can register, outline the \nservice they would like to provide to customers and the network resources they would \nneed. After an assessment is made within the operator, a frame agreement can be \ngenerated and appropriate service levels established. Third-party providers might, for \nexample, be assigned difference levels of privileges. For example, Blue partners \nmight be tightly constrained and permitted to avail of a very basic service level and \naccess to particular network resources; Platinum partners might have more privileges \nand be given full access to the network and network assets. The brand of the Blue \npartner will typically be weaker and less recognizable than that the operator; poor \ncontent from providers within this category could seriously undermine the brand of \nthe operator. The Blue partner may possibly not be permitted to release content onto \nthe operator network unless is it first checked by the operator. For Platinum partners, \ntheir brand may be as strong as or stronger than that of the operator and within their \nservice level they may have permission to launch products directly onto the market \nover the operator network. Indeed, the privileges granted to premium brands may \nposition them closer to an MVNO than a mere content creator.  \n \nThe service level agreement is essentially the framework within which the business \nmodel is operationalized. It defines, among other things, access to transmission \nnetwork resources (such as SMS, MMS, or presence) and when network resources can \nbe used. The service level essentially determines the extent of trust that exists between \noperator and third-party provider. The service level will govern such aspects of the \nservice as subscription\/provisioning model, billing models, service lifecycle, media \nand content type. Additionally, an operator may sign a deal with a mapping service or \npayment service, so rather than all content providers who require these services for \ntheir offerings signing separate deals, they can piggy-back on this resource. \n \nTechnologies can also facility the day-to-day management and administration of the \nrelationship. Speedily reporting customer take-up of services, categories of customer \nusing service are valuable information for content creators. Service quality and usage \nFROM VALUE CHAIN TO VALUE NETWORK \nPublished in European Management Journal \nVol. 24, Issue 2, 2006 Page 19 \ncan be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the optimum service portfolio and \nfacilitate settlement between the operator and content creator. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nMobile content and services is the future: a world where customers will, through a \nhandheld device, transact banking services, make purchases, access news and stories, \nplay games, view videos and TV, gamble, etc. However, it is unlikely that today\u2019s \nmobile operator will be able to develop the types and range of content and services \nthat consumers will increasingly demand. They may not even wish to. A host of \ndifferent players in the mobile ecosystem are already jockeying for position, including \ninfrastructure, content providers, content aggregators, software developers and device \nmanufacturers. This ecosystem is a set of firms that co-create value. Those who \nunderstand the sources of value in the network and are able to exploit them will be the \nwinners. \n \n \nEnd Notes \n \n1\n Leading global investment bank Nomura estimate that subscriber growth is slowing and the Western \nEuropean mobile market crossed the 90% penetration milestone at end of 2004.
