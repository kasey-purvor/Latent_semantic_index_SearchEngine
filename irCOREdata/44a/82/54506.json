Although electromagnetic\nmachines have lower power density that their hydraulic counlterparts, electrically based power units have\nthe potential to offer significant system advaltages in terms of higher reliability, reduced overall system\nmass. imnproved control dynamnics ald better energy efficienlcy [3.4]; the latter translating to a net\nreduction in mass and drag from the umbilical cable connection for power transmission from a surface\nship,\nDuring deep-sea operation of the ROV, buoyancy constraints and cooling issues make it highly desirable\nto operate power electronic drive systems in an oil-filled environment subiect to the high ambient pressure\n(up to 400bar), as opposed to being housed in a thick-walled metallic pressure vessel subject to nolninal\natmospheric pressture Ib(ar). However, capacitors (particldarly electrolytic types) and some industrial\ngrade semicondtuctor devices are known to be extremely sensitive to presswre dute to their constrLction,\nand can implode under piessures corTesponding to 3000m sea depth (300bar). As drive systems must\nwith-stand z300bar ambient, the components shouldd ideally be able to withstand 1.33x is pressure\n(z4OObar) to provide an operating safety margin on the system components. Tests investigating electrical\nand mechanical failure of the power electronic devices by subjecting commercial devices to target\npressures in an oil-filled pressure chamber have been previously attailed, resulting to several device\nfailures [4]. For electric thrluLster actuators and servo systems, it is apparent that daltetratives to industry\nLIt 2005 - Dn.dcn P.1\nSens;orIcss Cowol of lIrvlSrvl,; for dcc,-rj'--;.

Here tlen, matrix converters, [3,5,6,7,8] present a natural candidate,\nsince, unlike conventional rectifier\/inverter counlterparts viz. voltage- and current-source variants,\nconverters based on a switch matrix do not require a two-stage (rectifier\/inver-ter) conlversion process, with\nthe consequential elimination of the intermediate reactive energy storage elemelnt.\nMoreover, by reducing the number of external wiring\/connections between the motor cand invetter by\nemploying sensorless commutation of PMSMs, whichi traditionally require the use of encoder, resolver or\nHall-effect signal feedback of rotor position, reliability cal be improved further. The paper will show that\nby employing only measured motor terminal quantities and observer-based rotor position estimation\nschemes, no extenial sensor signal connections (between motor ald inverter) are necessary, since the\nrequired current\/voltage transducers (which operate satisfactorily in high-pressure oil-filled environmnents)\nLOB 2005 - 9nsdcii 1SB1.l 0.2\nCoau-ol C-f l'Irvlsrvli; for dccp-..tROV -N \"ciTzd by Marix Convcr.crs BINGaAM1 MiS\nDEl 2005 L)i--;c11i ISBSN :9(U1548tf-5 1i9.2\nScnsorlcs.s Conu.1 cfPMSMs for dccp-scaRO V. exeked by Matrix Convcrccrs I3INGHAM CLis\ncanl be sited at the power conlverter within the high-pressure chamber.

By\ncomparison with Fig. 3(b), the common requirement for control of PMSMs using 6-switch VSIs, and\nthose of a matrix converter, can be seen. In particular, they both requfre knowledge of rotor position and\ndemanded V\u00a7 and V, and feedback of motor phase currents. A typical configLration of a 3x3 matrix\nconverter employed including in-line filter components, is shown by Fig. 4.\nRotor position estimation in stator fixed reference frame\nAn EKF is considered for sensorless estilnation of rotor position for a PMSM powered by a mnatrix\nconverter.

Measuremnents taken during steady-state operation\nof the machine with a speed demalnd of 418 rad\/s (1000 rpm) are given in Fig. 5; specifically showing.\nrotor algular velocity, anld importantly. the difference (error) between the measured and observed rotor\nposition, respectively. The stealy state position error is seen to be 4102 rad. As demonstrated, die\nestimates a-e sufficiently accurate for the machine to adequLately operate under closed-loop torque ald\nspeed control at steady-state.\nAn attractive feature of the EKF for this (application is the ability to maintain obsetrver stability at zero\nspeed for start-up without incorporating any supplementary open-loop routines. By way of example, Fig. 6\nshows measured results from die observer wlhen the system is excited widli a step demand from 0 to 209\nrad\/s (500 rpm) at t=Os. As is evident, estimates of speed and position are accurately determined and\nstability is mainltained with a steady-state position error of approx -0.2 rad. Moreover, it can be seen that\nfor tcOs zero speed of the observer estimates is maintained. Of note, however, is fiat position error\nsignificcantly increases about zero speed, althogh thle observer\/controller combination does not show amy\ndestabilising tendencies.\nFigure 7, shows the response of the m-otor to a transient change in speed demand from +209 rad\/s to -209\nrad\/s (+500 rpm to -500 rpm) at t-Os. It cal be seen that the EKF accurately estimates the speed, Fig.\n7(a). Although a slight increase of transient error in position estimates is evident, ultimately motor\nperfonnance is not unduly degraded, Fig. 7(b).\nA significant impe-diment to the general adoption of position sensorless control of die PMSM excited by\nmatrix conlverters for applications on deep sea ROVs is the behaviour of the observer in response to a\nfault. ranging fr-om fauLlts due to damage to the umbilical resultinlg in inlput supply faults. to conlverter\nmcaiftmutions and machinle supply fauilts. Such conditions can provoke instability of the observer estimates\nthat can be critical to matrix convet-ter modulation schelnes. Here then. fautlt tolerant imnplelnenltation is\nproven, such that. upon ocCLrrence of a mnotor open-circuit phase fault, from zero speed, the PMSM\nremains functional, and is transferred into a safe mode of operation. Figure 8(a) and (b) shows an example\nof a single phase machine termiTnal fault, indicated by the loss of supply to phase B, ald operated from\nstart-up to steady-state 125rad\/s (300rpm). Phase voltage is monitored at the output terminal of the\nconvetter prior to the open circuit fault, henlce, is included in the measurelnenlts. Upon detection of the\nfault the covarialce matrices Q (and R are mnodified such that stability of the observer estimncates is retaLined.\nFigure 8(c) shows the rotor angtlar velocity whilst operating at 125rad\/s (300rpm), and the difference\n(error) between the measured and observed rotor position, respectively, where a steady state position error\nis seen to be r0.4 rad, Fig 8(d). As delmonstmted, the observer does not show any destabilizing tendencies\nand the estimated position rema-ins sufficiently accurate for the machine to operate under closed-loop\ntorquLe and speed control, ultimnately allowing the ROV to accomnmodate a \"limp-home\" fcacility.

The conventional voltage source inverter (VSI) which traditionally facilitates\nmost synchronous machine drives in indushty applications. consist of large dc-lik electrolytic capacitors,\nthat cannot withstand the considered pressures unless enclosed in large air-filled chanbers cat -atmnospheric\npressure, which tends to be of high mass. Here, excitcation of PMSMs via matrix converters, which\neliminates large dc-link capacitors, provides an alternative solution. In particular, witlh a view to\nminimising external cabling\/routing requirements, and simplifying motor designs by vitte of not having\nto house and seal rotor position sensors and associated electronics in die motor housing, sensorless\noperation of PMSM excited by 3x3 matrix converter is reported. It is shown that observer-based\nsensorless schemes, developed for control of PMSMs with traditional VSIs, can be readily applied to\nvariants driven matix converters, with experimental results showing the benefits of employing such\nschemes. Start-up from zero speed and speed reversal are experimentally demonstrated. Finally, a degree\nof fault tolerant operation is demonstrated, such that upon occurrence of a phase fault, the PMSM remains\nfuLnctional, and the stability of the observer is maintained.\nReferences\n[t] Bhangu, B.
