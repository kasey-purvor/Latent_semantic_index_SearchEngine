INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, physics of quantum ratchets draw a grow-\ning attention. In mechanics, a ratchet is a device that is used\nto restrict motion in one direction while permitting it in an-\nother. In general, one means by a ratchet any sort of asym-\nmetric potential or a potential lacking a center of the spatial\ninversion. At the turn of 1980s and 1990s, it was understood\nthat unbiased nonequilibrium noncentrosymmetric systems\ncan generate transport of particles, and this conception has\nroots in different fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. In\nmechanical, electronic, optical, and biological systems, a\nparticle, classical, or quantum, charged or neutral, propagat-\ning in a periodic potential with broken centrosymmetry and\nsubjected to an ac force exhibits a net dc macroscopic flow.\nExamples are electrons in solids, Abrikosov vortices in su-\nperconductors, and biological motor proteins.1 One of imple-\nmentations of the ratchet phenomenon is a linear photogal-\nvanic effect \u0001LPGE\u0002. It represents a generation of a dc\nelectric current under absorption of linearly polarized light in\nunbiased crystals of piezoelectric classes. Glass et al.2 were\nthe first to attribute a photoinduced current observed in ferro-\nelectric LiNbO3 to a novel photogalvanic effect and pro-\nposed the first correct model for its microscopic qualitative\ninterpretation. A consistent quantitative theory of LPGE was\ndeveloped by Belinicher and Sturman followed by other\ntheorists \u0001see Refs. 3 and 4\u0002.\nNoncentrosymmetric bulk semiconductors and hetero-\nstructures are natural quantum ratchets and the further stud-\nies of LPGE in these systems allow one to elucidate the\nwhole problem of the ratchet effect. In particular, a current of\nthe LPGE consists of two contributions, ballistic and shift,\nwhich as a rule are comparable in the order of magnitude.5 It\nis important to note that similar two contributions to the\nelectric current, called the skew-scattering and side-jump\ncurrents, do exist in the anomalous Hall effect \u0001see the recent\nreview by Sinitsyn6\u0002. Another important point is that one\nshould include into the light absorption process contributing\nto the ballistic current an additional simultaneous scattering\nfrom a static defect or a phonon compared to the light-\ninduced optical transition, leading to the shift current. In\nGaN-based structures first observation of LPGE has been\nreported quite recently.7\u201312 Here, we present results of de-\ntailed experimental and theoretical investigation of LPGE in\nheterostructures based on GaN and its alloys with AlN. The\ncommercial fabrication of blue and green light-emitting di-\nodes have led to well established technological procedures of\nepitaxial preparation of these heterostructures and initiated a\ngreat activity on investigations of their properties.13 The pho-\ntogalvanics serves as a solid bridge between transport and\noptics and, therefore, reveals both transport and optical prop-\nerties of the systems under study.\nII. SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS\nThe experiments are carried out on \u00010001\u0002-oriented wurtz-\nite n-GaN \/Al0.3Ga0.7N heterojunctions grown by metal-\norganic chemical vapor deposition on C-plane sapphire sub-\nstrates \u0001for details of growth, see Ref. 7\u0002. The thickness of\nthe AlGaN layers was varied between 30 and 100 nm. An\nundoped 33 nm thick GaN buffer layer grown under a pres-\nsure of 40 Pa at a temperature of 550 \u00b0C is followed by an\nundoped GaN layer \u0001\u00032.5 \u0001m\u0002 grown under 40 Pa at\n1025 \u00b0C; the undoped Al0.3Ga0.7N barrier was grown under\n6.7 Pa at 1035 \u00b0C. The mobility and density in the two-\ndimensional \u00012D\u0002 electron gas measured at room temperature\nare \u0001\u00041200 cm2 \/Vs and Ns\u00041013 cm\u22122, respectively. To\nmeasure the photocurrent two pairs of contacts are centered\nat opposite sample edges with the connecting lines along the\naxes x \u0005 \u000611\u00af00\u0007 and y \u0005 \u0006112\u00af0\u0007 \u0001see inset in Fig. 1\u0002. The current\ngenerated by the light in the unbiased samples is measured\nvia the voltage drop across a 50 \u0002 load resistor in a closed-\ncircuit configuration. The voltage is recorded with a storage\noscilloscope.\nThe photocurrents were induced by indirect intrasubband\n\u0001Drude-type\u0002 optical transitions in the lowest size-quantized\nsubband. The emission from a terahertz molecular laser op-\ntically pumped by a transversely excited atmospheric pres-\nsure \u0001TEA\u0002 CO2 laser14 is used for the optical excitation.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 245304 \u00012008\u0002\n1098-0121\/2008\/77\u000124\u0002\/245304\u000112\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society245304-1\nWith NH3, D2O, and CH3F as an active media, we could\nobtain radiation pulses of duration of \b100 ns with wave-\nlengths \u0003=77, 90.5, 148, 280, 385, and 496 \u0001m and a power\nP\b5 kW. Radiation in both the normal- and oblique-\nincidence geometries was applied with the angle of incidence\n\u00040 varying from \u221230\u00b0 to +30\u00b0, \u00040=0, corresponding to the\nnormal incidence and laser beam lying in the \u0001xz\u0002 plane \u0001see\ninsets in Figs. 1, 2, and 4\u0002.\nOptically pumped molecular lasers emit linearly polarized\nradiation with the polarization plane determined by that of\nthe pump light: the electric field vector of the terahertz ra-\ndiation El generated by the molecular laser can be either\nparallel \u0001like for the lines \u0003=90.5, 148, and 280 \u0001m\u0002 or\northogonal \u0001lines 77, 385, and 496 \u0001m\u0002 to the polarization\nvector of the pump beam depending on the angular momen-\ntum selection rules for the pump and the terahertz transitions\nin the active media.14\nIn the experiments, the plane of polarization of the radia-\ntion incident on the sample was rotated applying \u0003 \/2 plates,\nwhich enabled us to vary the azimuth angle \u0005 from 0\u00b0 to\n180\u00b0 covering all possible orientations of the electric field\ncomponent in the \u0001xy\u0002 plane. Hereafter, the angle \u0005=0 is\nchosen in such a way that the incident light polarization is\ndirected along the y \u0005 \u0006112\u00af0\u0007 direction \u0006see inset in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0007.\nTo investigate the photogalvanic effects, we also use el-\nliptically polarized light. In this case, the polarization of the\nlaser beam is modified from linear to elliptical by means of\ncrystal quartz \u0003 \/4 plates. The counterclockwise rotation\n\u0001viewing from the laser side\u0002 of the optical axis of the\nquarter-wave plate by the angle \u0006p results in the variation of\nthe radiation helicity as Pcirc=\u2212sin 2\u0006p. Here, the angle\n\u0006p=0 is chosen for the position of the quarter-wave plate\noptical axis coinciding with the incoming laser polarization,\nin which case, the linear polarization degree is given by\nfourth harmonics of \u0006p.\nA series of measurements is carried out by making use of\nthe frequency tunability and short pulse duration of the free\nelectron laser \u201cFELIX\u201d at FOM-Rijnhuizen in the Nether-\nlands operated in the spectral range between 70 and\n120 \u0001m.15 The output pulses of light from the FELIX were\nchosen to be \u00046 ps long, separated by 40 ns in a train \u0001or\n\u201cmacropulse\u201d\u0002 of 7 \u0001s duration. The macropulses had a rep-\netition rate of 5 Hz.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIrradiating the \u00010001\u0002-grown GaN\/AlGaN heterojunction\nby polarized light at oblique incidence, as sketched in the\ninset to Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, causes a photocurrent signal measured\nacross a contact pair. The width of the photocurrent pulses is\nabout 100 ns, which corresponds to the terahertz laser pulse\nduration. The signal depends on the light polarization, and all\ncharacteristic polarization properties persist from 4.2 to 300\nK. The experimental data presented below are obtained at\nroom temperature. The effect is observed for all the wave-\nlengths applied \u0001between 77 and 496 \u0001m\u0002. We use two ge-\nometries: the longitudinal geometry \u0001Jx in the Fig. 1\u0002, in\nwhich the photocurrent is measured in the direction along\nin-plane component e\u02c6\u0005 and the transverse geometry \u0001Jy in the\nFig. 1\u0002, where the signal is detected in the direction normal\nto the light propagation unit vector e\u02c6 \u0006see the inset in Fig.\n1\u0001a\u0002\u0007.\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of the photocurrent on the\nazimuth angle \u0005 for both experimental geometries obtained\nFIG. 1. Photocurrent as a function of angle \u0005 measured at room\ntemperature at oblique incidence \u0001\u00040=15\u00b0\u0002 in the \u0001a\u0002 longitudinal\n\u0001Jx\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 transverse \u0001Jy\u0002 geometries. Photocurrent is excited by\nlinearly polarized radiation with wavelength \u0003=148 \u0001m and power\nP\u00045 kW. The full lines are fits to Eqs. \u00016\u0002. To get agreement with\nexperiments, we used one fitting parameter J0\u0007\b and introduced an\noffset Joffset for the current Jx detected in the direction of light\npropagation. The inset shows the experimental geometry. An addi-\ntional inset in the lower panel displays the sample and the radiation\nelectric field viewing from the source of radiation side.\nFIG. 2. Photocurrent as a function of angle of incidence \u00040\nmeasured at room temperature in the transverse geometry and azi-\nmuth angle \u0005=45\u00b0. Photocurrent is excited by radiation with wave-\nlength \u0003=148 \u0001m and power P\u00045 kW. The full line is the fit to\nEqs. \u00016\u0002 with the same fitting parameter J0 as used in Fig. 1. The\ninset shows the experimental geometry.\nWEBER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 245304 \u00012008\u0002\n245304-2\nat the positive incidence angle \u00040=15\u00b0 and e\u02c6\u0005 \u0005x. The polar-\nization dependence of the current in the longitudinal geom-\netry is well fitted by Jx=J0\u00011\u2212cos 2\u0005\u0002+Joffset, while for the\ntransverse geometry, we have Jy =\u2212J0 sin 2\u0005. Note that the\noffset contribution Joffset is observed in the longitudinal ge-\nometry only. Below, in Sec. IV B, we will demonstrate that\nexactly these dependences follow from the theory. As a func-\ntion of the incidence angle, the photocurrent changes sign at\n\u00040\u00040. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2, which shows the de-\npendence Jy\u0001\u00040\u0002 for the fixed azimuth angle \u0005=45\u00b0. A simi-\nlar dependence is also detected for the longitudinal current\nJx. We note that, like the polarization dependent contribution\nto the photocurrent, the detected offset current in the longi-\ntudinal geometry Joffset inverts its direction when the inci-\ndence angle changes its sign.\nThe wavelength dependence of the photocurrent obtained\nin transverse geometry at azimuth angle \u0005=135\u00b0 and angle\nof incidence \u00040=15\u00b0 is shown in Fig. 3. The data are mea-\nsured both on FELIX \u0001dots\u0002 and on molecular laser \u0001tri-\nangles\u0002. Fitting the data to the well known spectral behavior\nof the Drude absorption,16,17\nJy\u0001\t\u0002 \u0007 \n\u0001\t\u0002 \u0007\n1\n1 + \u0001\t\u000bp\u00022\n, \u00011\u0002\nwe obtain that the spectral behavior of the photocurrent can\nreasonably be described by this equation \u0001see full line in Fig.\n3\u0002. For the fit we used \u000bp as an adjustable parameter and\nscaled the whole dependence by the ordinate. Analyzing this\ndependence, we obtained that the momentum relaxation time\ncontrolling absorption is about 0.05 ps. This value is twice\nshorter than the transport time \u0001\b0.1 ps\u0002 extracted from the\nmobility measurements at room temperature. We attribute the\nshortening of the momentum relaxation time by electron gas\nheating due to absorption of the intense terahertz radiation.\nThe reduction in the mobility due to heating stems from\nenhancement of scattering by phonons under increase of\ntemperature. Using short 6 ps pulses of FELIX, we observed\nthat the response time is determined by the time resolution of\nour setup but it is at most 100 ps or shorter \u0001see the inset in\nthe left upper corner of Fig. 3\u0002. This fast response is typical\nfor photogalvanics where the signal decay time is expected\nto be of the order of the momentum relaxation time3,4,14 be-\ning in our samples at room temperature of the order of 0.1\nps.\nIn addition to the signal excited by the radiation at oblique\nincidence, we also detected a small photocurrent at normal\nincidence. The polarization behavior of this signal is shown\nin Fig. 4. In this setup, photocurrent dependences can be well\nfitted by Jx=J1 sin 2\u0005 and Jy =J1 cos 2\u0005 \u0001see also Sec.\nIV A\u0002. Rotating the sample around z axis, we proved that the\ncurrent direction is solely determined by the orientation of\nradiation electric field relative to the in-plane crystallo-\ngraphic axes. We note that this contribution is about 1 order\nof magnitude smaller than that at oblique incidence even at\nsmall angles \u00040\u000415\u00b0.\nBesides investigations of photocurrent in response to lin-\nearly polarized radiation, we also performed measurements\nunder excitation with elliptically polarized light. Such ex-\nperiments are of particular interest because such radiation, in\npartially circularly polarized light, has previously been used\nfor investigation of the circular photogalvanic effect\n\u0001CPGE\u0002,4,7,14 which coexist with the LPGE yielding beatings\nin \u0006p dependence. The CPGE is characterized by a photocur-\nrent whose direction is changed upon reversal of the radia-\ntion helicity. It has been observed in GaN-based structures\ndemonstrating a substantial structural inversion asymmetry\n\u0001SIA\u0002 in this wide band gap material.7,9\u201311 We have shown\nFIG. 3. Spectral dependence of the transverse photocurrent Jy\nmeasured at room temperature at oblique incidence \u0001\u00040=15\u00b0\u0002 for\nazimuth angle \u0005=135\u00b0. The data are obtained with the free electron\nlaser FELIX \u0001dots\u0002 and with molecular optically pumped laser \u0001tri-\nangles\u0002. The full line shows fit to Eq. \u00011\u0002.

In Fig.\n5\u0001a\u0002 transverse and longitudinal photocurrents are measured\nfor the experimental setup with El perpendicular to the inci-\ndence plane \u0001s polarization at \u0006p=0\u0002. We find that the polar-\nization dependences in this experiment are well fitted by Jx\n=J0\u00011\u2212cos 4\u0006p\u0002 \/2+Joffset and for transverse geometry by\nJy =\u2212J0 sin 4\u0006p \/2+J2 sin 2\u0006p \u0001see Sec. IV B 2 for theoreti-\ncal justification\u0002. We note that we used for fitting the same\nvalues of J0 and Joffset as in experiments with linearly polar-\nized radiation.\nAs we discussed above, our laser can generate linearly\npolarized radiation either oriented along or perpendicularly\nto the polarization of the pump radiation. By that we change\nthe position of the electric field of transformed beam relative\nto the optical axis of the quarter-wave plate, consequently\nchanging the orientation of the ellipse as well as radiation\nhelicity of the beam at the sample. In order to check how this\ntransformation influence results, we provided an additional\nexperiment using laser beam with again \u0003=148 \u0001m and\ne\u02c6\u0005 \u0005x but for El parallel to the incidence plane \u0001p polarization\nat \u0006p=0\u0002. Figures 5\u0001c\u0002 and 5\u0001d\u0002 show the data obtained in\nthis geometry. In contrast to the results presented in Figs.\n5\u0001a\u0002 and 5\u0001b\u0002, the photocurrent now shows another type of\npolarization dependences: Jx=J0\u00013+cos 4\u0006p\u0002 \/2+Joffset and\nfor transverse geometry Jy =J0 sin 4\u0006p \/2+J2 sin 2\u0006p. The\nfact that contribution given by J2 did not change is not sur-\nprising because this term is due to radiation helicity which\ndoes not change: Pcirc=\u2212sin 2\u0006p. The changes in contribu-\ntion induced by the degree of linear polarization are caused\nby the fact that the orientation of corresponding ellipses at\nthe sample at a given \u0006p is different.\nThe photocurrent polarization properties revealed experi-\nmentally both under normal and oblique incidences are ex-\nplained in Sec. IV, where we propose a simple illustrative\nmodel to interpret the nature of the photocurrent under study\nand derive general phenomenological equations. The mea-\nsured wavelength and temperature dependences of the LPGE\ncurrent are described in Sec. V where a microscopic theory is\ndeveloped.\nIV. MODELS, PHENOMENOLOGY, AND POLARIZATION\nDEPENDENCES OF THE PHOTOCURRENTS\nThe appearance of the LPGE can be visualized by a\nsimple one-dimensional model of randomly distributed but\nidentically oriented wedges acting as asymmetric scattering\ncenters.3,4,14 This model showing the generation of a photo-\ngalvanic current is relevant for 2D GaN\/AlGaN structures\nexcited by the radiation at normal incidence. In Fig. 6 a\nwedge with a base oriented along x direction is depicted\nwhich obviously does not possess a center of inversion. In\nequilibrium the velocities of electrons are isotropically dis-\ntributed. Application of an external in-plane alternating field\nE\u0001t\u0002=E sin \tt adds an oscillatory motion along the electric\nfield to the random thermal motion of the electrons. If the\nfield points along the height of the wedges \u0001E \u0005y or \u0005=0\u0002,\nthen the scattering results in a carrier flow in the \u0001\u2212y\u0002 direc-\ntion, yielding an electric current jy\f0 shown by the up ar-\nrow in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. By that electron fluxes along the x direction\ncompensate each other and jx is absent. A variation of the\nFIG. 5.

It may,\ne.g., reverse its direction, as it is shown in Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002 for the\nfield oriented along the base of the wedges, or rotate by 90\u00b0\nin the case of E directed at 45\u00b0 to y axis.\nIn order to describe the observed polarization and angle of\nincidence dependences, we derive here phenomenological\nequations for the photocurrents in 2D GaN-based structures\nand give a model for LPGE. The linear photogalvanic current\ndensity j is phenomenologically described by the following\nexpression:3,4,14\nj\u0003LPGE = \t\n\u0001\r\n\b\u0003\u0001\r\u0001E\u0001E\r\n\u0001 + E\rE\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002 . \u00012\u0002\nHere, E is the electric field amplitude of the light wave and \u0001\nis the third-rank tensor symmetric in the last two indices. The\nindex \u0003 enumerates two in-plane coordinates x and y, while\n\u0001 and \r run over all three Cartesian coordinates.\nThe LPGE is allowed only in piezoelectric crystal classes\nof noncentrosymmetric media where nonzero components of\nthe tensor \u0001 do exist. The point symmetry of wurtzite 2D\nelectron systems confined in the \u00060001\u0007 direction is C3v,\nwhich differs from the C6v symmetry of the bulk GaN due to\nthe absence of translation along the growth axis z, i.e., be-\ncause of the presence of interfaces.

Normal incidence\nIn our experiments, a linear photogalvanic current is ob-\nserved at normal incidence \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002. It follows from Eqs.\n\u00014\u0002 that while at normal incidence the photocurrent propor-\ntional to the constant \b vanishes because Ez=0, the contri-\nbution determined by the constant \b\u0001 is nonzero. The obser-\nvation of this photocurrent is an important result\ndemonstrating substantial difference in symmetry between\nwurtzite 2D GaN\u00010001\u0002-based structures with C3v symmetry\nand zinc-blende GaAs- and InAs-based heterostructures hav-\ning C2v or D2d symmetry, where the LPGE is forbidden at\nnormal light incidence.\nThe polarization dependences for normal incidence follow\nfrom Eqs. \u00014\u0002 and are given by\njx = \b\u0001\u0001t0E0\u00022sin 2\u0005 ,\njy = \b\u0001\u0001t0E0\u00022cos 2\u0005 , \u00015\u0002\nwhere t0=2 \/ \u0001n\t+1\u0002 is the amplitude transmission coefficient\nfor normal incidence and n\t is the refractive index of the\nmedium \u0001for GaN, n\t=2.3\u0002. Both polarization dependences\nwell describe our experimental data with one fitting param-\neter \b\u0001 \u0001see the solid lines in Fig. 4\u0002. This agreement clearly\ndemonstrates the generation of LPGE current at normal inci-\ndence. We emphasize that the current direction depends on\nthe orientation of the polarization plane with respect to the\ncrystallographic axes x and y. In the case that contacts are\narbitrary oriented relative to the crystallographic directions,\nEq. \u00015\u0002 holds but the phase shift appears. This is considered\nin Appendix A.\nB. Oblique incidence\n1. Linear polarization\nLinear photogalvanic effect is also observed at oblique\nincidence. Moreover, comparison of Figs. 1 and 4 shows that\neven at a small incidence angle \u00040, the photocurrent is sub-\nstantially \u0001by the order of magnitude\u0002 larger than that at nor-\nmal incidence. While at normal incidence the photogalvanic\ncurrent is solely described by the constant \b\u0001 at oblique in-\ncidence, another term in Eq. \u00014\u0002 shows up. This term is de-\ntermined by the second linearly independent constant \b. The\npolarization dependence of this contribution in the geometry\nrelevant to the experiment depicted in Fig. 1, where the in-\ncidence plane is chosen to be the plane \u0001xz\u0002 and the angle \u0005\nis counted from y, is given by\njx\u0001\u0005\u0002 = \bE02tp2 cos \u0004 sin \u0004\u00011 \u2212 cos 2\u0005\u0002 ,\njy\u0001\u0005\u0002 = \u2212 \bE02tpts sin \u0004 sin 2\u0005 . \u00016\u0002\nHere, \u0004 is the refraction angle related to the incidence angle\n\u00040 by sin \u0004=sin \u00040 \/n\t, and ts and tp are the Fresnel ampli-\ntude transmission coefficients from vacuum to the structure\nfor the s- and p-polarized lights, respectively.24 These func-\ntions are shown in Fig. 1 by the solid lines. To get agreement\nwith experiments, we used the above equations with one fit-\nting parameter \b and introduced an offset for the current Jx\ndetected in the direction of the light propagation. Registra-\ntion of these characteristic polarization dependences proves\nobservation of LPGE at oblique incidence.\nComparing the results presented in Figs. 1 and 4, we can\nestimate of the ratio of different components of the tensor \u0001\nfor the studied structures. At \u0004\u00040.1 rad, ts\u0004 tp\u0004 t0, there-\nfore from the ratio of the amplitudes in Figs. 1 and 4 equal to\n\r\b\u0001 \/\b\u0004\r, we get \r\b\u0001 \/\b\r\u000410\u22122. This hierarchy of components\nof the third rank tensor \b\u0003\u0001\r in the systems of C3v symmetry\nis expectable;3 however, we demonstrate that the \b\u0001-related\neffect is observable. While the effect described by the con-\nstant \b also exists in the bulk GaN as well as in the C\u000fv\ngroup, the photocurrent proportional to \b\u0001 arises only due to\nthe reduced symmetry C3v of the system, i.e., due to size\nquantization. Therefore, the latter contribution should in-\ncrease at narrowing of the 2D layer.\nEquations \u00016\u0002 show that the photogalvanic current should\nfollow the dependence tstp sin \u0004, in particular, reverse its di-\nQUANTUM RATCHET EFFECTS INDUCED BY TERAHERTZ\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 245304 \u00012008\u0002\n245304-5\nrection upon inversion the angle of incidence. This behavior\nis indeed observed. Figure 2 shows the LPGE current depen-\ndence on the incidence angle \u00040 obtained for Jy at a fixed\nlinear polarization of radiation \u0001\u0005=45\u00b0\u0002. We note that the\noffset photocurrent observed in the longitudinal direction\nonly is always directed antiparallel to e\u02c6\u0005. We ascribe the off-\nset to the photon drag current which is linearly coupled to the\nphoton momentum. This effect is out of scope of the present\npaper.\nIn our experiments, we also probe LPGE for the light\ndirected along other crystallographic directions. Investigat-\ning transverse and longitudinal currents being perpendicular\nand parallel to the incidence plane, respectively, we observed\nthat all polarization dependences are described by the same\nconstant \b independently of the in-plane direction of the light\npropagation. The reason of this fact is that the current con-\ntribution proportional to \b is due to cone asymmetry being\naxially isotropic in the plane of our structures. Thus, this\nphotocurrent is totally determined by the light polarization\nstate and propagation direction, and it is independent of the\nincidence plane orientation relative to the in-plane crystallo-\ngraphic axes. For linearly polarized light, the photocurrent\ncan be presented in the invariant form as j=2\bE\u0005Ez, where\nE\u0005 is the projection of the light polarization vector E onto the\nstructure plane. It is seen that the LPGE current is always\ndirected along E\u0005. By introducing the azimuth angle \u0010 so that\n\u0010=0 corresponds to the polarization perpendicular to the in-\ncidence plane \u0001s polarization\u0002, we obtain for transverse \u0001j\u0002\u0002\nand longitudinal \u0001j\u0005\u0002 currents\nj\u0002 = \bE02tpts sin 2\u0010\u0001e\u0005\u02c6 \u0011 z\u02c6\u0002 ,\nj\u0005 = \bE02tp2 cos \u0004\u00011 \u2212 cos 2\u0010\u0002e\u02c6\u0005 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere z\u02c6 is the unit vector along the normal.\n2. Elliptical polarization\nIllumination of the structure by elliptically polarized ra-\ndiation also results in generation of the LPGE current, which\nis determined by the linear polarization degree of the light.\nHowever, elliptically polarized radiation is also characterized\nby the nonzero helicity. This results in the additional effect\nsolely determined by the degree of circular polarization, the\ncircular photogalvanic effect.3,4,14 This effect is phenomeno-\nlogically described by\nj\u0003CPGE = \t\n\u0001\n\u0012\u0003\u0001i\u0001E\u0011 E\u0001\u0002\u0001 = E0\n2tptsPcirc\u0001\u0002e\u02c6\u0002\u0003, \u00018\u0002\nwhere e\u02c6 is the light propagation unit vector and \u0002 is the\nsecond-rank pseudotensor. In the systems of C3v symmetry,\nthe tensor \u0002 has one linearly independent component,\nnamely, \u0012xy =\u2212\u0012yx\n\u0012. Thus, the CPGE current flows always\nperpendicularly to the incidence plane.\nIn our experimental setup, a quarter-wave plate is rotated\nby the angle \u0006p between the laser light polarization vector El\nand the principal axis of the polarizer \u0001see inset to Fig. 5\u0002.\nThe total photogalvanic current is given by both second and\nfourth harmonics of this angle. While radiation handedness is\nsolely determined by the angle \u0006p and does not depend on\nthe relative orientation between El and the plane of inci-\ndence, the orientation of the ellipse is substantially different.\nIn particular, for El perpendicular to the incidence plane at\n\u0006p=0 \u0001s polarization\u0002 and for El parallel to the incidence\nplane at \u0006p=0 \u0001p polarization\u0002, the orientation of the corre-\nsponding ellipses on the sample differs by 90\u00b0. Therefore, in\nthe former case, light is never p polarized, and in the latter\ncase, s polarization cannot be achieved, which is quite dif-\nferent from the geometry of half-wave plate where all states\nof linear polarization can be obtained. Thus, we derive two\nsets of equations describing experimental setup of Figs.\n5\u0001a\u0002\u20135\u0001d\u0002.\nIn the first geometry \u0001s polarization at \u0006p=0\u0002 from Eqs.\n\u00014\u0002 and \u00018\u0002, we get\njx\u0001\u0006p\u0002 =\n\b\n2\nE0\n2tp\n2 cos \u0004 sin \u0004\u00011 \u2212 cos 4\u0006p\u0002 ,\njy\u0001\u0006p\u0002 = E02tpts sin \u0004\u000e\u2212 \b2 sin 4\u0006p + \u0012 sin 2\u0006p\u000f , \u00019\u0002\nand for the latter geometry \u0001p polarization at \u0006p=0\u0002,\njx\u0001\u0006p\u0002 =\n\b\n2\nE0\n2tp\n2 cos \u0004 sin \u0004\u00013 + cos 4\u0006p\u0002 ,\njy\u0001\u0006p\u0002 = E02tpts sin \u0004\u000e\b2 sin 4\u0006p + \u0012 sin 2\u0006p\u000f . \u000110\u0002\nHere, we again took into account that in our samples \r\b\u0001\r\n\u0013 \r\b\r. Fits of experiment with the constant \b independently\nobtained from experiments with half-wave plates and \u0012 as a\nsingle adjustable parameter being the same for all curves\nyields a good agreement with the experiment. Here, again for\nthe longitudinal photocurrent, the offset due to photon drag\neffect shows up and has the same value as that in the experi-\nments with half-wave plates.\nV. MICROSCOPIC THEORY\nIn order to describe the measured dependences of the pho-\ntocurrent on wavelength and temperature, we have devel-\noped a microscopic theory of LPGE. First we consider the\ncontribution proportional to the coefficient \b in Eq. \u00014\u0002. This\ncontribution does exist not only in systems of the C3v or C6v\nsymmetry but is also allowed by the uniaxial point group\nC\u000fv. Therefore, we can calculate the \b contribution to jx,yLPGE\nin the uniaxial approximation. Then we turn to calculation of\nthe contribution proportional to \b\u0001 in Eq. \u00014\u0002 and surviving\nunder normal incidence due to the reduced C3v symmetry of\nthe system. We note that so far the LPGE in 2D systems has\nbeen treated theoretically for direct intersubband transitions\nonly.25,26 The mechanism of the LPGE under Drude absorp-\ntion differs strongly because scattering is unavoidably\npresent in the intrasubband absorption process.\nWEBER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 245304 \u00012008\u0002\n245304-6\nA. Microscopic model for oblique incidence\nMicroscopically the LPGE current consists of the shift\nand ballistic contributions, which in general can be compa-\nrable in order of magnitude. We start from the analysis of the\nshift contribution and then turn to the ballistic contribution.\n1. Shift contribution\nThe shift contribution arises due to coordinate shifts of\nthe free-carrier wave-packet center-of-mass by microscopic\nlengths in quantum transitions. The corresponding current is\na product of the elementary charge e, the transition probabil-\nity rate Wk\u0001k, and the shift vector Rk\u0001k or, explicitly,\njLPGE\u0001shift\u0002 = 2e\t\nk\u0001k\nWk\u0001kRk\u0001k, \u000111\u0002\nwhere the factor \u201ctwo\u201d accounts for spin degeneracy. The\nelementary shift is related to the transition matrix element\nMk\u0001k by\n5\nRk\u0001k = \u2212\nIm\u0006Mk\u0001k\n\u0001 \u0001\u0002k + \u0002k\u0001\u0002Mk\u0001k\u0007\n\rMk\u0001k\r\n2 = \u2212 \u0001\u0002k + \u0002k\u0001\u0002arg\u0001Mk\u0001k\u0002 ,\n\u000112\u0002\nwhere arg\u0001u\u0002 is the phase of the complex number u. The\nabove two equations are general and valid for the shift pho-\ntocurrent calculation in any frequency range.3,4 Here, for the\nfirst time, we apply them to consider the LPGE under the\nDrude absorption. Note that Eq. \u000112\u0002 was applied in the\ntheory of anomalous Hall effect6,27 where the coordinate shift\nat scattering is called a side jump.\nThe main contribution to the matrix element for indirect\nintrasubband optical transitions,\nM1k\u0001,1k\n\u0005\n= U1k\u0001,1k\u000e Vk\u0001Ek\u0001 \u2212 Ek \u2212 Vk\u0014\t\u000f , \u000113\u0002\ncomes from two-quantum processes a1 and a2 with interme-\ndiate virtual states in the same e1 subband \u0001see Fig. 7\u0002.\nHere, the 2D electron kinetic energy Ek=\u00142k2 \/2m, m is\nthe electron in-plane effective mass, Vk is the matrix element\nof electron-light interaction,\nVk = \u2212\ne\u0014A\nmc\ne \u00b7 k ,\n\t, A, and e are the frequency, amplitude, and unit polariza-\ntion vector of the light wave, U1k\u0001,1k is the matrix element of\nintrasubband elastic scattering e1,k\u2192e1,k\u0001, and the super-\nscript \u0005 indicates that the process is allowed for the polariza-\ntion e containing an in-plane component e\u0005.

A value of \u0017 is nonzero due to an asymmetrical\nshape of the electron envelope functions in the e1 and e2\nsubbands caused by the build-in electric field. An inhomoge-\nneous asymmetrical distribution of scatterers along the z axis\ncan also contribute to \u0017.\n2. Ballistic contribution\nIn order to obtain a nonzero ballistic photocurrent, it is\nnecessary to go beyond the approximation of single-impurity\nscattering and take into account simultaneous scattering by\ntwo impurities in one process. Such optical-absorption pro-\ncesses are schematically shown in Fig. 8. Let us introduce\nthe antisymmetrical part Wk\u0001k\na\nof the k\u2192k\u0001 transition rate\nWk\u0001k, which changes sign under simultaneous inversion of\nthe wave vectors k and k\u0001. It can be expressed in terms of\nFermi golden rule,\nWk\u0001k\na\n=\n2\u0019\n\u0014\n\rMk\u0001k\ra\n2\u0006f\u0001Ek\u0002 \u2212 f\u0001Ek\u0001\u0002\u0007\u0015\u0001Ek\u0001 \u2212 Ek \u2212 \u0014\t\u0002 ,\n\u000119\u0002\nwhere \rMk\u0001k\ra\n2 is the antisymmetric part of the squared modu-\nlus of the optical two-impurity-mediated matrix element\nMk\u0001k. Then the ballistic contribution to the LPGE current is\ngiven by\njLPGE\u0001ball\u0002 = 2e\t\nk,k\u0001\nWk\u0001k\na \u000bp\u0001vk\u0001 \u2212 vk\u0002 , \u000120\u0002\nwhere vk=\u0014k \/m is the electron velocity.\nHere it is worth discussing the dependence of the ballistic\nand shift contributions on the concentration of elastic scat-\nterers Nd. For two-impurity scattering the probability rate\nWk\u0001k\na \u0007Nd\n2\n. In contrast, the single-impurity scattering rate\nWk\u0001k in Eq. \u000111\u0002 linearly depends on Nd. However, the bal-\nlistic current is controlled by the momentum relaxation time\n\u0006see the factor \u000bp in the right-hand side of Eq. \u000120\u0002\u0007. Since\n\u000bp\u0007Nd\n\u22121\n, the ballistic and shift currents are both proportional\nto Nd. In this sense, there is an analogy between a pair of the\ntwo contributions to the photocurrent and a pair of the side-\njump and skew-scattering currents in the anomalous Hall\neffect.6\nIn order to get the photocurrent proportional to both e\u0005\nand ez, we extract from \rMk\u0001k\r\n2 the interference term propor-\ntional to Re\u000bM\u0005M\u0002\u0001\f, where M\u0005 and M\u0002 are the contribu-\ntions to the matrix element of the indirect optical transition\nproportional to ex,y and ez, respectively.

Microscopic model for normal incidence\nAn ideal GaN\/AlN interface has the point-group symme-\ntry C3v, which is a subgroup of the C6v\n4 space group of a bulk\nwurtzite crystal. The group C6v\n4 is nonsymmorphic and con-\ntains, in addition to C3 and \u000ev, the elements \u000b\rC6\r\u0003\f , \u000b\r\u000ed\r\u0003\f,\nwhere \u0003 is the fractional lattice translation \u00010,0 ,c \/2\u0002 and c is\nthe lattice constant along the principal axis z. In the 2D struc-\ntures, the screw-axis and glide-plane operations shift the in-\nterfaces along z not bringing the system into coincidence\nwith itself and, as a result, the point-group symmetry reduces\nto C3v.\nFor the C6v symmetry of bulk wurtzite structure, charac-\nteristic of III-nitrides, the nonvanishing third order tensor\ncomponents \b\u0003\u0001\r symmetrical in \u0001 and \r are \bzzz, \bzxx\n=\bzyy, and \bxxz=\bxzx=\byyz=\byzy\n\b. Therefore, forbidden\nare such bulk effects as the second-harmonic generation for\nexcitation along z, a piezoelectric field induced in the \u0001x ,y\u0002\nplane under the deformation in this plane and the photocur-\nrent in the \u0001x ,y\u0002 plane for the light propagating along z. The\nreduction from C6v to C3v removes these restrictions and four\nnew nonzero components appear, \bxxy =\bxyx=\byxx=\u2212\byyy\n\n\b\u0001 \u0006see Eqs. \u00014\u0002\u0007. Note that it is the interface that is exclu-\nsively responsible for the appearance of new components.\nHere we propose a microscopic model of the LPGE under\nnormal incidence. In this geometry virtual transitions via\nother size-quantized electronic subbands are forbidden;\ntherefore, we should consider the light absorption with inter-\nmediate states either in the same e1 electronic subband or in\nthe valence band. In the first case, see Fig. 7, the reduced C3v\nsymmetry manifests itself in the scattering matrix element\nU1k\u0001,1k, and, instead of Eq. \u000116\u0002, one should replace the el-\nementary shift in the product \rMk\u0001k\r\n2Rk\u0001k by the scattering\ninduced shift,\nRk\u0001k\n\u0001U\u0002\n= \u2212\nIm\u0006U1k\u0001,1k\n\u0001 \u0001\u0002k + \u0002k\u0001\u0002U1k\u0001,1k\u0007\n\rU1k\u0001,1k\r\n2 .\nNote that the main contribution to U1k\u0001,1k dependent only on\nthe difference \u0001k\u0001\u2212k\u0002 does not result in the shift because the\noperator \u0001\u0002k+\u0002k\u0001\u0002 nullifies such a term. Similar contribution\nto the LPGE current has been calculated for Drude absorp-\ntion in the heavy-hole subband of a bulk p-GaAs,30 where\nthe shift appeared due to interference of polar and deforma-\ntion scattering mechanisms on optical phonons.\nFor optical transitions going via \u001b6 valence-band states,\nthe elementary shift can be related to asymmetry of the in-\nterband optical matrix elements, in which case the asymme-\ntry of the interband scattering matrix element is neglected.\nWe consider this mechanism in more detail. Taking into ac-\ncount the symmetry considerations, we can present the inter-\nband matrix elements of the operator e\u0005 \u00b7p \u0001where p is the\nmomentum operator\u0002 between the conduction-band state \u001b1\nand the valence-band states \u001b6 as\ne\u0005 \u00b7 pc\u001b1;v,\u001b6x\u0001k\u0002 = iPex + Q\u0001exky + eykx\u0002 , \u000123\u0002\ne \u00b7 pc\u001b1;v,\u001b6y\u0001k\u0002 = iPey + Q\u0001exkx \u2212 eyky\u0002 ,\nwhere P and Q are real constants. Multiband derivation of\nthese contributions for GaN-based 2D structures is given in\nAppendix B. The matrix element Q is nonzero due to the\npresence of the interface in the heterostructure. This ap-\nproach is similar to description of interface inversion asym-\nmetry induced spin splitting in the envelope-function\nmethod, where the \u0015-functional terms are introduced into the\ninterband Hamiltonian \u0001see Refs. 31 and 32\u0002. As a result, we\nexpect a strong dependence of Q on the confinement size\nbecause Q is proportional to a product of the electron and\nhole envelope functions at the interface \u0006see Eq. \u0001B3\u0002\u0007. We\nexpand Mk\u0001k and Rk\u0001k in powers of small parameters \u0014\t \/Eg,\nE\u00af \/Eg\u00131.

Experi-\nment shows a noticeable magnitude of the LPGE current\nunder normal incidence \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002.\nVI. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we discuss the role of the contributions to\nthe total current and analyze the frequency and temperature\ndependences of LPGE. An analytical estimation for the shift\nand ballistic photocurrents at Drude absorption is readily\navailable for the photon energies \u0014\t small compared to the\nelectron typical energy E\u00af , which is relevant to our experi-\nments performed at room temperature and applying terahertz\nradiation. In this case, Eqs. \u000117\u0002 and \u000122\u0002 reduce to\njLPGE\u0001shift\u0002 \u0003 2\u0017ez21\n\n\u0005I\n\u001621\n,\njLPGE\u0001ball\u0002 \u0003 \u0017ez21\n\n\u0005I\n\u001621\n\u000e\u0014\t\n2E\u00af\n\u000f2.\nSince \u0014\t \/E\u00af\u00131 the shift contribution dominates the LPGE.\nThis estimation is confirmed by the study of the frequency\ndependence of LPGE. Indeed, while the shift photocurrent\nfollows the frequency dependence of the absorbance which,\nfor Drude processes, is given by Eq. \u00011\u0002, the ballistic contri-\nbution has another frequency dependence because in this\ncase jLPGE\u0001ball\u0002 \u0007\n\u0005\t2. The observed good agreement of the cur-\nrent and absorption frequency behavior \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002 unam-\nbiguously proves the dominating role of the shift contribu-\ntion to the LPGE. We note that such a spectral behavior of\nthe LPGE has been previously observed in bulk III-V\nsemiconductors.33\nWe note that even for the opposite limit of \u0014\t \/E\u00af\u001c1 the\nLPGE due to Drude absorption is still dominated by the\nshift contribution. In this case, estimations yield\njLPGE\u0001shift\u0002=\u2212\u00013 \/2\u0002jLPGE\u0001ball\u0002 .\nNow we analyze the temperature dependence. As follows\nfrom Eq. \u000117\u0002, the temperature dependence of the LPGE cur-\nrent is given by jLPGE\u0001shift\u0002\u0007\u0017\n\u0005\u0001T\u0002. Taking into account tempera-\nture behavior of the Drude absorption \u0006see Eq. \u000118\u0002\u0007, we get\njLPGE\u0001shift\u0002\u0007\u0017 \/\u000bp\u0001T\u0002. Here we again use the relation \u0014\t\u0013E\u00af\n\u0003kBT. Variation of the temperature results in the change of\nthe dominant scattering mechanisms. Typically in the low-\ndimensional structures by raising temperature, we get a tran-\nsition from the temperature-independent scattering rate by\nimpurities 1 \/\u000bp\nimp to the fast-increasing rate due to scattering\nby phonons 1 \/\u000bp\nph\u0001T\u0002. As a result, we have for the LPGE\ncurrent\njLPGE\u0001shift\u0002 \u0007\n\u0017imp\n\u000bp\nimp +\n\u0017ph\n\u000bp\nph\u0001T\u0002\n.\nThis expression demonstrates that despite the inverse mobil-\nity 1 \/\u0001\u0001T\u0002\u00071 \/\u000bp\nimp+1 \/\u000bp\nph\u0001T\u0002 is a monotonous function of\ntemperature \u0001see inset in Fig. 3\u0002 and the asymmetry factors \u0017\nare temperature independent, the LPGE current can have a\nminimum or even change the sign at temperature increase.\nThis is due to the interplay between two contributions to the\nLPGE caused by different scattering mechanisms character-\nized by substantially different values of \u0017imp and \u0017ph possibly\nbeing even opposite in signs. Due to the fact that only one\ntime is temperature dependent, \u0006\u000bp\nph\u0001T\u0002\u0007 variation of tempera-\nture may result in the dominance of one or the other contri-\nbution to the LPGE current.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we have studied the linear photogalvanic\neffect in wurtzite GaN\u00010001\u0002-based heterojunctions under\nexcitation by linearly and elliptically polarized lights in the\nterahertz frequency range. Experimentally, the properties of\nLPGE have been revealed as a function of the incidence\nangle and the polarization state of radiation. A detailed point-\ngroup symmetry analysis of the polarization properties\nshows an agreement between the experimental data and the\nphenomenological theory of LPGE. Phenomenologically, the\neffect is described by the two linearly independent coeffi-\ncients \b and \b\u0001, the former being allowed by the C3v, C6v,\nand even C\u000fv symmetries and the latter being nonzero only\nfor the C3v symmetry. An observation of the photocurrent\nunder normal incidence determined by \b\u0001 unambiguously\ndemonstrates a reduction in the heterojunction symmetry\nfrom hexagonal C6v to trigonal C3v. However, beginning\nfrom very small oblique angles first contribution to the pho-\ntocurrent prevails over the second one. The frequency depen-\ndence of the measured LPGE photocurrent exhibits a Drude-\ntype behavior. A microscopic theory of LPGE under the\nintrasubband \u0001Drude\u0002 absorption in the lowest e1 electron\nsubband has been developed. While calculating the \b-related\nphotocurrent, we have included virtual indirect optical tran-\nsitions via the higher subband e2, estimated both the shift\nand ballistic contributions and showed that the first one ex-\nceeds the other by a large factor \u0007\u0001E\u00af \/\u0014\t\u00022. The dominating\nshift photocurrent repeats a Lorentzian frequency depen-\ndence of the Drude-absorption coefficient, in agreement with\nthe experiment. The temperature dependence of the photo-\ncurrent is governed by a product of the absorption coefficient\nand the dimensionless parameter of asymmetry.

IV A we get phenomenological equations for\nLPGE at normal incidence. We obtained that the photocur-\nrent direction is determined by the orientation of the electric\nvector with respect to the crystallographic axes x and y. Most\nconvenient for this effect is to investigate the current in the\ndirections along and perpendicular to one of the mirror-\nreflection planes of the C3v point group. However, in contrast\nto III-V semiconductor heterostructures where well deter-\nmined in-plane crystallographic orientation is naturally ob-\ntained by cleaving in GaN\/AlGaN heterojunctions grown on\nthe sapphire substrate this may be not the case. Therefore, we\nobtain here the LPGE for the arbitrary orientation of contacts\nin respect to the crystallographic directions. To describe this\nsituation, we introduce the angle \u001d between the in-plane\ndirections x\u0001 and y\u0001 along, which the contacts are made and\nthe crystallographic axes x and y \u0001see Fig. 9\u0002. The symmetry\nconsiderations yield the expression for the combination of x\u0001\nand y\u0001 components of the photocurrent, which follows from\nEqs. \u00014\u0002 for Ez=0,\njx\u0001 + ijy\u0001 = i\b\u0001\u0001Ex\u0001 \u2212 iEy\u0001\u0002\u0001Ex\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212 iEy\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002exp\u00013i\u001d\u0002\nor, equivalently,\njx\u0001 = \b\u0001\u0001t0E0\u00022 sin\u00012\u0005 \u2212 3\u001d\u0002 ,\njy\u0001 = \b\u0001\u0001t0E0\u00022 cos\u00012\u0005 \u2212 3\u001d\u0002 , \u0001A1\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is counted from y\u0001: E\u0001\u0005=0\u0002 \u0005y\u0001.\nEquations \u0001A1\u0002 demonstrate that the azimuth angular de-\npendence for arbitrary orientation of contacts in respect to\nthe crystallographic directions remains the same but differs\nby the phase shift 3\u001d. Finally, we note that the photocurrent\ndetermined by the constant \b in Eq. \u00014\u0002 is independent of the\nangle \u001d because it is totally defined by position of the inci-\ndence plane and polarization of light. Therefore, Eq. \u00017\u0002\nholds for any angle \u001d.\nAPPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF INTERBAND MATRIX\nELEMENTS\nEquation \u000123\u0002 can be obtained from the two-band electron\neffective Hamiltonian\nHc\u001b1;v,\u001b6x\u0001k\u0002 =\n\u0014\nm0\n\u0001iPkx + Qkxky\u0002 , \u0001B1\u0002\nHc\u001b1;v,\u001b6y\u0001k\u0002 =\n\u0014\nm0\n\u0016iPky + Q12 \u0001kx2 \u2212 ky2\u0002\u0017\nby using the relation\ne \u00b7 pc\u001b1;v,\u001b6\u0001k\u0002 =\nm0\n\u0014\n\u0001e \u00b7 \u0002k\u0002Hc\u001b1;v,\u001b6\u0001k\u0002 .\nWe describe the symmetry reduction from C6v to C3v by\nintroducing a \u0015-functional perturbation V\u02c6 \u0001\u0015\u0001z\u2212zif\u0002, where zif\nis the interface coordinate in the z axis and the operator V\u02c6 \u0001\ntransforms according to the representation B1 of the group\nC6v with the basic function y3\u22123x2y \u0001here as before we as-\nsume that one of the three mirror-reflection planes in the C3v\ngroup contains the axes y ,z and is perpendicular to x\u0002.
