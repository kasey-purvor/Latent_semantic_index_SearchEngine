Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable room for improvement.\\ud\nMethodology\/Principal Findings: Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently. However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only. sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008) PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions. RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5\u2019-ends of these six Northernsupported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using 5\u2019-RACE analysis.\\ud\nConclusions\/Significance: We have developed, computationally examined and experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we have undertaken suggests that ~40% of sRNAscanner hits with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification.\\ud\nsRNAscanner is available from: http:\/\/bicmku.in:8081\/sRNAscanner or http:\/\/cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in\/sRNAscanner\/","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/,","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/8808\/1\/journal.pone.0011970%5b1%5d.pdf","pdfHashValue":"b7ba712b77dc8078ba2f8bcc28c5c92f5d807d1d","publisher":"Public Library of Science","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8808<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2016-04-19T10:44:24Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_6<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9550<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_9<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nsRNAscanner: A Computational Tool for Intergenic Small RNA Detection in Bacterial Genomes<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nSridhar, Jayavel<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSambaturu, Narmada<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSabarinathan, Radhakrishnan<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nOu, Hong-Yu<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nDeng, Zixin<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSekar, Kanagaraj<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRafi, Ziauddin Ahamed<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRajakumar, Kumar<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nBackground: Bacterial non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis.

Many sRNAs have been assigned\nregulatory roles in the survival and physiology of the organism [2].\nProkaryotic sRNAs are known to play roles in regulation of\nsporulation [3], sugar metabolism [4], iron homeostasis [5],\nsurvival under oxidative stress [6], DNA damage repair,\nmaintenance of cell surface components [7] and regulation of\npathogenicity [8]. Though sRNAs do not code for peptides they\nexert their function through antisense modes by RNA\u2013RNA base\npairing [9,10] or by antagonizing target proteins through RNA\u2013\nprotein interactions [11]. Genomic screens for sRNAs have been\nmost extensively conducted in the model organisms E. coli K-12\n[12,13] and Bacillus subtilis [3]. More recently, significant numbers\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\nof sRNAs in pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus [14],\nPseudomonas aeruginosa [15] and Listeria monocytogenes [16] have been\nidentified, though functional roles of the majority remain to be\ndetermined.\nMost computational methods, such as QRNA [17] and\nIntergenic Sequence Inspector [18], use intergenic sequence\nconservation among related genomes to identify sRNAs. By\ncontrast, the RNAz [19] and sRNAPredict [15,20] programs\nutilize estimated thermodynamic stability of conserved RNA\nstructures and existing \u2018orphan\u2019 promoter and terminator\nannotations for sRNA predictions, respectively. Previous studies\nby Argaman et al. [12], Chen et al. [21], Pfeiffer et al. [22] and\nValverde et al. [23] had used promoter and terminator signals to\npredict sRNAs but did not provide computational scripts for\ngeneral use. This study implements a generic transcriptional signal\ndetection strategy and applies it systematically to obtain repro-\nducible computational results and matching \u2018prediction scores\u2019.\nFurthermore, sRNAPredict [15,20] and SIPHT [24] require\navailable promoter information and databases of rho-independent\nterminators predicted by TransTermHP [25] to identify sRNAs.\nMoreover, sRNAPredict2 requires as inputs sequence and\nstructure conservation data as identified by Blast and QRNA,\nrespectively, markedly hampering detection of sRNAs mapping to\nnon-conserved intergenic sequences. The proposed tool overcomes\nthese limitations by searching genome sequences for orphan\ntranscriptional signals and integrating signal co-ordinates to\nidentify candidate intergenic sRNAs without any pre-require-\nments.\nComparative genomic approaches are restricted to identifying\nsRNA candidates located within conserved genomic backbone\nregions common to closely related bacteria [26]. However, most\nbacterial species have significant cumulative spans of multiple\nstrain-specific sequences or islands, dispersed along the genome,\nmany of which play key adaptive and\/or pathogenesis-related\nroles [27,28]. Indeed, genomic island-borne sRNAs have been\nidentified in S. aureus [14] and Salmonella enterica serovar\nTyphimurium [22,29]. Furthermore, sRNAs transcribed from\nstrain-specific regions of S. Typhimurium were reported to partake\nin complex networks for stress adaptation and virulence regulation\n[8,22,28,29] leading Toledo-Arana et al. [8] to emphasize the\nneed for identification of strain-specific sRNAs in pathogens. S.\nTyphimurium is an important food-borne pathogen that causes a\nsubstantial burden of diarrhoeal disease globally. Life-threatening\nsystemic infections can also occur in those with severe co-\nmorbidities, at extremes of age and\/or with impaired immune\nsystems.\nWe have constructed a position weight matrix (PWM) based\ntool named sRNAscanner, using E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA-\nspecific transcriptional signals as positive training data, for the\nidentification of intergenic sRNAs. Experimentally characterized\nE. coli sRNA promoters appear to vary slightly in base\ndistribution frequencies when compared to E. coli mRNA\npromoters (Table S1a), though it remains possible that observed\ndifferences may be statistically insignificant. sRNAscanner cut-off\nthresholds were identified using the known E. coli K-12 MG1655\nsRNAs as a positive dataset [30]. The predictive abilities of\nsRNAscanner and sRNAPredict2 [20] were then compared by\nanalysing 13 bacterial genomes representative of diverse species.\nAs a specific case study, we analyzed a S. Typhimurium complete\ngenome sequence and experimentally validated a small set of\npreviously uncharacterized predictions. Our results strongly\nsupport the accuracy and utility of sRNAscanner as a tool for\nthe discovery of novel sRNA genes within intergenic regions of\nbacterial genomes and hint at the broader power of customized\nPWMs as a generic strategy for detection of defined genomic\nfeatures in diverse bacterial genomes.\nMethods\nSummary of the sRNAscanner program\nsRNAscanner uses as inputs matching complete bacterial\ngenome sequence and protein coding table files in standard\nFASTA and tab-delimited text formats, respectively, to identify\nsRNA genes in intergenic regions. The sRNAscanner suite consists\nof algorithms to perform the following functions: (a) construct\nPWMs from sRNA-specific transcriptional signals, (b) search\ncomplete genome sequences using constructed PWMs to identify\n\u2018orphan\u2019 intergenic promoter and terminator locations, (c) perform\ncoordinate based integration of promoter\/terminator signals to\ndefine putative intergenic transcriptional units (TU) and (d) select\npredicted TUs based on cumulative sum of scores (CSS) values\nabove a nominated threshold. The CSS value is determined by\nsummating three individual matrix-specific sum of scores (SS)\nvalues for each candidate TU (see below for calculation of SS\nvalue). sRNAscanner uses pre-computed PWM and the following\npre-defined parameters to predict intergenic sRNAs: promoter\nbox 1 SS value ($2), promoter box 2 SS value ($2), terminator SS\nvalue ($3), spacer 1 range (defines distance between promoter\nboxes 1 and 2; 12\u201318), spacer 2 range (defines distance between\npromoter box 2 and terminator signal; 40\u2013350), Unique Hit value\n(200) and CSS ($14). The Unique Hit value identifies potential\nTU from a set of overlapping hits based on the presence of closely\nlocated start coordinates mapped within a defined window size\nwhich by default is set at 200 bp. sRNAscanner selects the TU\nwith the maximum CSS value from each overlapping set as a\nunique representative hit for the set. Note: all parameters can be\naltered by users as required. Predicted TUs are examined for the\npresence of a putative ribosome binding site and initiation codon;\nif both signals are identified the TUs are classified as coding for\nputative mini-proteins [28]. Remaining TUs are considered to\ncode for candidate sRNA molecules. A flowchart summarizing the\nsRNAscanner algorithm is shown in Figure 1.\nConstruction of PWMs from training data\nsRNAscanner computes a PWM of four rows and x columns for\nN input sequences each having x residues; N and x can be any\npositive integer. The program uses multiple sequences of sRNA-\nspecific transcriptional signals in fasta format as input for the\nconstruction of alignment matrices. The alignment matrix\ncaptures the number of occurrences, ni,j, of letter i at position j\nacross the set of aligned sequences. Subsequently, actual\noccurrence values were converted into log-odd scores; values that\nreflect the positional weights of each of the four bases (A, T, G, C)\nat each position. Frequency calculations and scoring schemes were\nadopted from previous algorithms and the positional weights were\nderived from the alignment matrix itself. A PWM was then derived\nfrom the above alignment matrix using the following formula (see\nHertz and Stormo, 1999 [31] for details):\nln\nnijzpi\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004\nNz1\u00f0 \u00de\npi\n& ln\nfij\npi\nIn this formula N is the total number of input sequences and pi is\nthe a priori probability of the letter i occurring at position j of an\ninput sequence; by definition for a four component system (A, C,\nG & T) this expected frequency is 0.25 for each of the four\nnucleotides, fi,j= ni,j\/N is the frequency of the letter i in position\nDiscovery of Bacterial sRNAs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\nj. Importantly, the precise genomic base frequency of the\ntraining or test genomes do not have a role in the construction of\nPWM. The log-odd scores are used for the construction of\nPWM; the algorithm was implemented using the PWM_create\nmodule of the sRNAscanner program. We have used ten\npromoter boxes and twenty one rho-independent terminators\n[21] of experimentally-verified E. coli K-12 sRNA genes as\ntraining data to construct PWM1 (promoter box1), PWM2\n(promoter box2) and PWM3 (rho-independent terminator)\n(Table S1 and Figure S1).\nIdentification of intergenic sRNA specific transcriptional\nunits\nPWM1, PWM2 and PWM3 matrices were used individually to\nscan entire genome sequences, one nucleotide at a time, by a\nsliding window method as described previously [31]. The width of\nFigure 1. Flowchart illustrating an overview of the sRNAscanner algorithm. The final step was performed using the web-based TargetRNA\n[41] utility and\/or by comparison of sRNAscanner hits with RNA deep sequencing datasets. The output dataset obtained is shown as the red outlined\nbox at the bottom of the figure. sRNAscanner hits supported by TargetRNA only are classed as possible sRNA candidates, whilst those supported by\ndeep seqeuncing are considered as probable sRNA candidates. Details of parameter values used in this study are as indicated in the text.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.g001\nDiscovery of Bacterial sRNAs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\neach sliding window was equal to the length of its matching input\nPWM. The matrix-specific SS value of each DNA sequence\nwindow was calculated by adding the PWM-determined scores\ncorresponding to each of the respective bases within the window as\ndescribed previously [31]. Each successive sliding window was\nassigned a SS value and it was compared against a selected\nthreshold SS value obtained by analysis of the 92 known E. coli K-\n12 sRNA genes from the sRNAMap and Rfam datasets (http:\/\/\nsrnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw\/). sRNAscanner was run with an\narbitrary minimum SS value of 1 for each of the three matrices\nto identify potential intergenic TUs which were then compared\nmanually with the known K-12 sRNA genes to identify\nconcordant pairs. Using these criteria and no imposed CSS cut-\noff, 66 of the 92 known sRNAs were identified as possessing\nsRNAscanner-detectable potential transcriptional signals (Table\nS2). Re-iterative empirical analyses using progressively higher\nmatrix-specific SS values were performed to identify matrix-\nspecific default SS thresholds that sought to maximize sensitivity\nwhilst minimizing false-positive hits; SS cut-offs determined were\nas mentioned previously. Sequences having PWM1-, PWM2- and\nPWM3-specific SS values above the threshold scores were selected\nas potential promoter box 1, promoter box 2 and terminator signal\nhits, respectively. Next, the orientation, relative position and\nspacing of PWM-detected hits were examined against pre-defined\nallowable ranges for spacer 1 and spacer 2 to identify potential\nTUs. Spacer parameters used were based on analysis of the length\nand transcriptional signal spacing features of known E. coli and\nother Enterobacteriaceae sRNAs. Sequences satisfying both spacer\nchecks and a selected CSS cut-off value were identified as likely\nTUs. The PWM3 SS value was expected to contribute most to the\nCSS score as for the known E. coli K-12 TUs detected by the\nprogram, PWM3 scores varied from 4.54\u201311.19, whilst the top\nvalues for PWM1 and PWM2 were 4.98 and 6.03, respectively.\nImportantly, higher SS values on one or both of the other matrices\nwould not have compensated for a single below-threshold score.\nIdentified TUs were compared with protein coding annotation\nfiles. Non-redundant, intact, non-overlapping TUs identified\nwithin intergenic regions alone and lacking putative ribosome\nbinding sites and start codons were reported as probable sRNA-\nspecific intergenic TUs.\nsRNAscanner availabitlity and requirements\nProject name: sRNAscanner; Home page: http:\/\/bicmku.in:8081\/\nsRNAscanner or http:\/\/cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in\/sRNAscanner\/;\nOperating system: Linux\/Unix platforms; Programming language:\nC++; Compiler: g++\/gcc 4.2 or higher; License: GNU GPL.\nBacterial strain and growth conditions\nS. enterica Typhimurium wild type strain SL1344 (JVS-1574,\nMPIIB culture collection) was used for experimental validation.\nFor early stationary phase (ESP) and late stationary phase (LSP)\ncultures, 25 ml of Luria-Bertani broth was inoculated with a 1\/\n100 overnight culture and grown at 37uC in a shaking incubator\n(220 rpm) in a 100 ml flask. Optical density at 600 nm (OD600)\nwas monitored. Two ESP cultures (OD600 = 0.5 [OD-0.5],\nOD600 = 2.0 [OD-2.0]) and four LSP cultures (3 h [3H], 6 h\n[6H], 9 h [9H] and overnight [ON] post-OD600 = 2.0) were\nobtained. Approximately 108 ESP (OD600 = 0.5) cells were treated\nwith mitomycin C (0.5 mg\/ml) [SOS], acidic LB (pH 5.4) [Acid]\nor cold shock (15uC) [Cold] for 30 min to induce an SOS\nresponse, acid stress or cold shock conditions, respectively.\nAbbreviations shown are to describe the eleven growth conditions.\nSalmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) induced cultures [SPI-1]\nwere grown with high salt-containing LB broth (0.3 M NaCl) for\n12 hours at 37uC\/220 rpm in tightly closed tubes. Salmonella\npathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) induced cultures [SPI-2] were\nprepared by inoculating 70 ml of SPI-2 medium [32] in 250 ml\nflasks, with 1\/100 inoculums grown in SPI-2 medium overnight,\nand incubated at 37uC\/220 RPM until reaching an OD600 = 0.3.\nThe above cultures were spun down and the cell pellets mixed with\nstop mixture [95% ethanol (v\/v), 5% phenol (v\/v)] and\nimmediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nRNA isolation and Northern blot analysis\nTotal RNA was prepared from frozen cells using the TRizol\n(Invitrogen) method and treated with DNase I (Fermentas) as\ndescribed previously [32]. Approximately 10 mg of RNA for each\ngrowth condition was added to 26 RPA buffer and run on 6%\npolyacrylamide\/7 M urea gels, along with a pUC8 DNA ladder\n(Fermentas). After separation RNA was transferred to Hybond-XL\nnylon membranes (GE Healthcare) and UV cross-linked. Potential\nsRNA transcripts were detected using c-ATP end-labeled\noligonucleotide probes (Table S3).\n59 RACE mapping of RNA transcripts\n59RACE experiments were performed as described by Vogel\nand Wagner [33]. In summary, primary transcripts were treated\nwith tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), ligated to A4 RNA\nadapters (500 pmol) at the 59ends and reverse transcribed into\ncDNA with random hexamers (400 ng) using Superscript II\nReverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Next, the first strand of the\ncDNA molecule was PCR amplified using an adapter-specific\nprimer (JVO-0367) and matching sRNA-specific primer (Table\nS3). Amplified 59 RACE products were cloned into TOPO\npCR2.1 and sequenced from both ends with M13 primers.\nResults and Discussion\nOptimization of sRNAscanner with known E. coli K-12\nMG1655 (NC_000913) sRNA data\nWe analysed the E. coli K-12 MG1655 (NC_000913) genome\nusing pre-defined parameters (see User Guide) and matrices\ntrained with data from ten promoter boxes and twenty one rho-\nindependent terminators [21] of experimentally verified E. coli K-\n12 sRNA genes. To maximize sensitivity at the expense of\nspecificity, we ran this analysis without application of a CSS cutoff.\nPredicted intergenic sRNA-specific transcriptional units were\ncompared with the 92 reported E. coli K-12 sRNAs available in\nsRNAmap [1] and\/or Rfam [34]. Physical locations of 66 of the\n92 experimentally-validated sRNAs fully or partially overlapped\nwith sRNAscanner-identified putative TUs. However, application\nof the program without a CSS cut-off led to extremely low\nspecificity with .2,500 putative intergenic TU identified. Subsets\nof known MG1655 sRNA predicted by sRNAscanner and other\ncomputational and experimental methods are shown as a Venn\ndiagram (Figure 2). The mean and standard deviation of the CSS\nof experimentally verified MG1655 sRNA transcriptional units\ndetected by sRNAscanner were used to define a stringent CSS cut-\noff value of 14 (mean + standard deviation = 13.87). Nevertheless,\nthe substantial overlap between whisker plots of CSS values for the\nknown sRNAs and the uncharacterized sRNAscanner hits\n(Figure 3A) and the fact that these two sets remained unresolved\neven when CSS score distributions were plotted as a histogram\n(Figure 3B), suggested that many genuine E. coli K-12 intergenic\nTUs remained to be experimentally defined or that the matrices\nand\/or the sRNAscanner algorithm lacked specificity. Interest-\ningly, the single uncharacterized hit outlier with a CSS=19.56 has\nalso been predicted by SIPHT (Figure 3A). Lists of sRNAscanner-\nDiscovery of Bacterial sRNAs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\npredicted (CSS.14) known and novel candidate sRNA TUs in\nMG1655 are as shown (Table S2 and Table S4).\nAnalysis of sRNAscanner performance characteristics\nsRNAscanner was run with the training set derived matrices\nand pre-defined parameters. Excluding the 10 sRNAs used to\ninform the PWM1 and PWM2 matrices, sRNAscanner (CSS.14)\ndetected 24% of the known E. coli K-12 sRNA genes [1].\nAssessment of the specificity of sRNA prediction tools remains\nextremely challenging as there are no gold standards and known\nbacterial sRNAs are likely to represent no more than the tip of a\nvast \u2018RNome\u2019 iceberg. Even experimental validation is problem-\natic as individual sRNA may only be expressed under highly\nspecific conditions and\/or at extremely low levels. We have\nattempted to examine the specificity of sRNAscanner through\nthree bioinformatics approaches. sRNA genes used to inform the\ntraining dataset were included in these subsequent analyses.\nFirstly, we have generated a conventional Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) plot [35] based on analysis of the E. coli K-\n12 genome (Figure 4A). The set of known K-12 sRNAs predicted\nby sRNAscanner were defined as the \u2018True positive\u2019 set and the\nimpact of the full range of CSS cut-off values was assessed. The\nROC plot and related normalized frequency distribution graph\n(Figure 4B) suggested a major sensitivity\u2013specificity sacrifice with\nthere being no classical optimum point; favoring either led to a\nmarked deterioration of the other. However, even by these criteria\nthe sensitivity (Sn) \u2013 specificity (Sp) performance of sRNAscanner at\nCSS.14 (Sn=32%; Sp=95%) was comparable to that of\nsRNAPredict2 (Sn=20%; Sp=96%). Secondly, we compared\nthe performance of the pre-computed training-set-derived PWMs\nwith those of randomly generated \u2018equivalent\u2019 matrices and used\nboth sets of matrices to analyse the E. coli K-12 genome sequence.\nEquivalent random matrices were generated by randomly\nshuffling entire columns within each matrix (R1 random matrices)\n(Figure S2), the numbers within individual columns (R2 random\nmatrices) (Figure S3), and a combination of these two shuffling\nstrategies (R3 random matrices) (Figure S4). This approach\npreserved the precise SS characteristics for matching genuine\nand random matrices and allowed the same SS and CSS\nthresholds to be used. However, only the R1 random matrices\nrepresented the same combination of nucleotide preferences,\nthough present in distinct permutations as compared to the\noriginal matrices. The training and random PWM sets were used\nto search the E. coli K-12 genome to identify occurrences of each\nmotif and, through integration of these data, TU-like arrange-\nments. The occurrence frequencies (OF) of individual motifs were\ndefined as the number of predictions per nucleotide of the\ngenome. The ratios of OF obtained with the random and\nrationally-derived original matrices were expected to be inversely\nproportional to the ratios of matrix specificities [36]. However\nwith the exception of the comparison between the genuine and R1\nversions of PWM2, all three training PWM had higher OF than\nmatching random matrices when applied to the K-12 genome\nsequence (Figure 4C). This was most marked for PWM3 with its\nthree random versions exhibiting less than 20% of the hits\nobserved with the training set-derived matrix. These data strongly\nargued against the random nature of bacterial intergenic DNA\nand demonstrated the relative abundance of terminator-like motifs\nFigure 2.

Hits identified by the random matrices were\ncompared with known sRNA regions to identify the number of\nknown sRNA TUs detected. The stringent requirement for the\ncorrectly ordered, orientated and appropriately spaced occurrence\nof each of the three independently detected transcriptional signals\nwas expected to filter out much of the noise. Indeed, use of the\ntraining dataset-derived PWMs resulted in identification of 66\nknown sRNA TUs (CSS scores [mean, range]: 12.87, 8.65\u201317.57),\nwhile use of the R1 random PWM, the best performing of the\nrandom versions, yielded only 14 known sRNA TUs with lower\nCSS scores (11.42, 9.77\u201314.09). The R2 and R3 shuffled matrices\nidentified 5 and 9 potential sRNA TUs, respectively. Hence, the\ntraining matrices detected more than four times as many known\nsRNA TUs but only approximately twice as many total \u2018TU\u2019 hits\nas the R1 matrices (Figures 4D and 4E). Nevertheless, as the\nrandom matrices yielded up to 68% as many total \u2018TU\u2019 hits as the\ntraining set-derived PWMs it would appear that even with a\nstringent CSS.14 cut-off, that at best only about 40% of positive\ncalls were valid. As a third approach, we hypothesized that the\nratio of the numbers of hits obtained with the full complement of\nconcatenated genuine intergenic DNA to those found on\nrandomly shuffled intergenic sequences would provide a qualita-\ntive measure of specificity. The concatenated sequence comprising\nall K-12 intergenic sequences fused end-to-end (VIGS) was\nsubjected to random nucleotide shuffling to generate ten random\nvariants (RIGS-1 \u2013 RIGS-10). A length distribution histogram of\nthe \u2018sRNA\u2019 hits in the VIGS and RIGS sequences is shown in\nFigure 4F. Consistent with a moderate level of specificity, the\nconcatenated native intergenic sequence yielded approximately\nthree times as many hits as those identified on the \u2018average\u2019\nrandom intergenic sequence (435 vs 152) (Table S5). Use of future\nadditional filters and\/or genus-adapted PWMs may lead to\nincremental increases in specificity, perhaps with minimal loss of\nsensitivity. For example, TransTermHP-2.07-predicted rho-inde-\npendent terminators in E. coli K-12 and S. Typhimurium LT2\ntypically exhibited PWM3 scores of $6 as opposed to the PWM3\nminimum score criterion of .3, suggesting a possible route to\nspecificity gain.\nHead to head comparison of sRNAscanner and\nsRNAPredict2\nA diverse group of bacterial genome sequences representative of\nEnterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae, Clostridia-\nceae, Chlamydiaceae and Lactobacillaceae were analyzed using sRNAs-\ncanner. Intergenic transcriptional unit data derived from sRNAs-\ncanner analyses were compared with previously reported\nsRNAPredict2 results [20]. Manual curation of these predictions\nidentified partial or complete overlaps with known sRNAs.\nsRNAscanner (CSS.14) and sRNAPredict2 detected a total of\n180 (Sn=31.3%) and 184 (Sn=32%) known sRNA genes,\nFigure 3.

By comparison, 92 known sRNAs were\npredicted uniquely by sRNAPredict2. However, sRNAPredict2\nyielded appreciably more uncharacterized hits than sRNAscanner\n(2953 vs 2344), suggesting a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the\nlatter. Similarly, large numbers of novel hits missed by\nsRNAPredict2 were predicted by sRNAscanner, and vice versa.\nIndeed, combined use of the two tools may potentially offer a\ndegree of cross-validation. However, sRNAscanner as optimized\npresently appeared to be more appropriate for the analysis of\nFigure 4. The three approaches used to estimate the specificity of sRNAscanner. Conventional ROC (A) and normalized frequency\ndistribution (B) plots were generated following analysis of the E. coli K-12 genome. The brown line in (A) denotes the point on the ROC curve which\ncorresponds to CSS= 14. For these analyses, the set of 92 known sRNA were defined as the true positive set.

Typhimurium LT2 genome using sRNAs-\ncanner under default conditions yielded a total of 38 known and\n118 novel candidate sRNAs (Figure 5, Table S4). The genomic\nlocations of the 118 novel sRNA candidates were compared with\nputative intergenic transcripts detected in deep sequencing\nlibraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated RNA obtained\nfrom S. Typhimurium SL1344 grown under multiple conditions\n[32,37,38] [unpublished data, J. Vogel]. S. Typhimurium SL1344\nwas used for all subsequent experimental validation as no\ncomparable RNA deep sequencing dataset was available for S.\nTyphimurium LT2. Sixteen novel sRNA candidates were detected\nby both sRNAscanner and deep sequencing analysis (Table 2).\nNorthern and 59 RACE based verification of novel sRNAs\npredicted by both sRNAscanner and deep sequencing\nNorthern blot experiments using oligonucleotide probes target-\ning the 16 novel sRNA candidates mentioned above were\nperformed (Table S3). RNA samples were harvested from cells\ngrown and\/or subjected to eleven different growth conditions. Six\nof the candidates (sRNA1, sRNA3, sRNA6, sRNA8, sRNA10 and\nsRNA12) yielded distinct Northern-detectable transcripts of\nbroadly similar sizes to the sRNAscanner-predicted entities\n(Figure 6).

of Bacterial sRNAs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\ntranscripts. Given the above assumption, sRNA1 and sRNA12\nwere expressed under all growth conditions tested; sRNA8 and\nsRNA10 were detected in late stationary phase samples only,\nwhilst sRNA3 appeared to be induced specifically under cold\nshock conditions. The sRNAscanner-predicted sRNA6 overlapped\nwith a previously proposed processed 59UTR fragment of the yhiI\ntranscript [38] that was likely to match the transcript we detected\nunder ESP-2.0 conditions. However, in this study the sRNA6 locus\nwas also found to express a distinct ,70 nt transcript found under\nLSP and SPI-1\/SPI-2 inducing conditions only.\nThe 59ends of six candidate sRNA transcripts corresponding to\nthe same Northern-supported candidates were successfully\nmapped by 59RACE analysis. The 59 RNA termini identified for\nsRNA1, sRNA6 and sRNA10 were coherent with computationally\npredicted transcriptional start sites but start-sites of the remaining\nthree candidates varied significantly from those predicted by\nsRNAscanner (Table 2). The extents of overlap between sRNA\npredicted entities, deep sequencing identified sequences and\n59RACE mapped start-sites are shown schematically in Figure 6;\nNorthern-detected transcripts were excluded as their precise\nlocations could not be conclusively inferred on the basis of\navailable data.\nPotential biological significance of sRNAscanner\npredictions for Salmonella Typhimurium\nRecent discoveries of three sRNAscanner identified hits that\nhad originally been classified as novel provide further biological\nvalidation of this algorithm; sRNA17, sRNA20 and sRNA29 are\nnow known as isrM [29], STnc410 [22] and rseX [39,40],\nrespectively. As many functionally characterized sRNAs are\nantisense regulators of cognate mRNA targets [41], we hypoth-\nesized that the presence of a matching TargetRNA hit may allow\nfor more reliable identification of genuine sRNAs. However, we\nemphasize that bioinformatically-derived predictions of sRNA\u2013\nmRNA interactions remain fraught with problems. Consequently,\npending experimental validation by gel-shift assays or other\nmethodologies TargetRNA data need to be treated as truly\nputative. We identified 22 sRNAscanner hits with TargetRNA-\nidentified potential mRNA targets (Figure S5); five had also been\ndetected in the deep sequencing dataset (Table 2). Several\nTargetRNA-identified genes play roles in pathogenesis. sRNA18\nputatively targets STM1403 that codes for SscB, a type III\nsecretion system (T3SS) chaperone encoded by Salmonella patho-\ngenicity island 2 (SPI-2). SscB is needed for normal secretion and\nfunction of the SseF T3SS effector, which in turn is required for\nSalmonella-induced epithelial cell filamentation and bacterial\nproliferation in macrophages [42]. sRNA33 is believed to regulate\nssaP, which is postulated to code for part of the SPI-2 T3SS\ntranslocon apparatus itself [43]. sRNA23 is predicted to regulate\nRcsF which has been proposed as one of two proximal membrane-\nlocated sensors for the Rcs phosphorelay signal transduction\nsystem that coordinately regulates expression of SPI-1\/SPI-2,\nflagellar, fimbrial and capsule-related colonic acid synthesis genes\n[44]. sRNA28 is hypothesized to target stiB, a fimbrial chaperone\ngene, potentially allowing for sRNA28-based fine-tuning of Sti\nfimbriae expression [45]. sRNAs have also been shown to regulate\nS. Typhimurium outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles in\nresponse to envelope stress [46] or nutrient availability [39].\nSimilarly, sRNA29 and sRNA7 are predicted to interact with\nOMP-encoding genes (Table 2). Clearly, data supported solely by\nsRNAscanner and TargetRNA bioinformatics predictions remain\nspeculative and robust experimentation would be required to\nvalidate these prior to drawing firm conclusions.\nb\n,c\nsR\nN\nA\nsc\nan\nn\ne\nr-\np\nre\nd\nic\nte\nd\ntr\nan\nsc\nri\np\nt\nco\no\nrd\nin\nat\ne\ns\nan\nd\nle\nn\ng\nth\n(n\nt)\n.\nd\nG\ne\nn\ne\ns\nfl\nan\nki\nn\ng\nca\nn\nd\nid\nat\ne\nsR\nN\nA\nlo\nci\no\nb\nta\nin\ne\nd\nfr\no\nm\nK\nEG\nG\ng\ne\nn\no\nm\ne\nm\nap\ns.\ne\n5\n9e\nn\nd\ns\no\nf\nth\ne\np\nri\nm\nar\ny\ntr\nan\nsc\nri\np\nts\nid\ne\nn\nti\nfi\ne\nd\nu\nsi\nn\ng\n5\n9R\nA\nC\nE\ne\nxp\ne\nri\nm\ne\nn\nts\n.\nf S\nta\nb\nle\ntr\nan\nsc\nri\np\nts\nid\ne\nn\nti\nfi\ne\nd\nb\ny\nN\no\nrt\nh\ne\nrn\nan\nal\nys\nis\nin\nth\nis\no\nr\no\nth\ne\nr\nre\nce\nn\nt\nst\nu\nd\nie\ns.\ng\nT\nh\ne\nm\nid\nd\nle\nar\nro\nw\nh\ne\nad\nre\np\nre\nse\nn\nts\nth\ne\no\nri\ne\nn\nta\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nth\ne\nsR\nN\nA\ng\ne\nn\ne\n;\nle\nft\nan\nd\nri\ng\nh\nt\nar\nro\nw\nh\ne\nad\ns\nin\nd\nic\nat\ne\no\nri\ne\nn\nta\nti\no\nn\ns\no\nf\nfl\nan\nki\nn\ng\ng\ne\nn\ne\ns.\nh\nP\no\nte\nn\nti\nal\np\nri\nm\nar\ny\nm\nR\nN\nA\nta\nrg\ne\nt\nid\ne\nn\nti\nfi\ne\nd\nu\nsi\nn\ng\nth\ne\nT\nar\ng\ne\ntR\nN\nA\nto\no\nl\n[4\n1\n].\ni G\ne\nn\nB\nan\nk\nfu\nn\nct\nio\nn\nal\nan\nn\no\nta\nti\no\nn\ns\no\nf\nth\ne\np\nu\nta\nti\nve\nta\nrg\ne\nt\nm\nR\nN\nA\ns.\nl R\ne\nfe\nre\nn\nce\ns\nre\nle\nva\nn\nt\nto\nth\ne\np\nre\nd\nic\nte\nd\nta\nrg\ne\nt\ng\ne\nn\ne\ns\nan\nd\n\/o\nr\nth\ne\nre\nce\nn\ntl\ny\nin\nd\ne\np\ne\nn\nd\ne\nn\ntl\ny\nid\ne\nn\nti\nfi\ne\nd\n\/p\nre\nd\nic\nte\nd\nsR\nN\nA\ns;\nFu\nll\nd\ne\nta\nils\no\nf\nre\nfe\nre\nn\nce\ns\nin\nd\nic\nat\ne\nd\nw\nit\nh\n\u2018R\n\u2019\nar\ne\np\nro\nvi\nd\ne\nd\nin\nSu\np\np\no\nrt\nin\ng\nIn\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n(F\nile\nS2\n).\nm\nN\nT\n,\nd\ne\nn\no\nte\ns\nn\no\nt\nte\nst\ne\nd\n.\nd\no\ni:1\n0\n.1\n3\n7\n1\n\/j\no\nu\nrn\nal\n.p\no\nn\ne\n.0\n0\n1\n1\n9\n7\n0\n.t\n0\n0\n2\nT\na\nb\nle\n2\n.\nC\no\nn\nt.\nDiscovery of Bacterial sRNAs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e11970\nFigure 6.

Despite use of\na small, single species-derived training set, we have demonstrated\nthe major utility of sRNAscanner to predict large numbers of\npotential sRNA genes in diverse bacterial species. Undoubtedly, it\nis vital to further experimentally validate the predictive accuracy of\nsRNAscanner and other sRNA prediction programmes using\nNorthern blot analysis, ultra-high-density cDNA sequencing\n[37,38] and other emerging tools. Nevertheless, caution is\nadvisable in interpretation of results as each experimental method\nhas its own strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, transcriptional\nsignals would be expected to vary considerably between\nphylogenetically distant organisms. Consistent with this idea, we\nfound that the E. coli-derived PWMs used in this study performed\nwell with medium and low GC genomes but not with high GC\ngenomes. Consequently, we propose that an organism-targeted\napproach is likely to lead to significantly enhanced performance\ncharacteristics. Importantly the tool developed and the strategy\nproposed would allow users to generate individualized PWMs\nbased on species-, genus- or family-derived training sets to better\nidentify sRNA genes in selected bacterial organisms. In addition, a\nreiterative process of PWM optimization and selection of\nrationally informed cut-offs based on newly discovered and\nvalidated sRNAs may allow for progressively higher levels of\nspecificity without excessive loss of sensitivity. Finally, we propose\nthat PWM-based scanning strategies may in time prove to be a\npowerful way of revealing other cryptic codes not only in DNA but\nin protein molecules as well.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Details of sRNAscanner training dataset.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s001 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nTable S2 List of known E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA TUs\nidentified by sRNAscanner.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s002 (0.08 MB\nPDF)\nTable S3 Oligonucleotides used in this study.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s003 (0.02 MB\nPDF)\nTable S4 Details of known and novel sRNA regions predicted\nby sRNAscanner in 13 bacterial genomes.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s004 (0.02 MB\nPDF)\nTable S5 Analysis of Virtual Intergenic Genome Sequences\n(VIGS) and Random Intergenic Genome Sequences (RIGS)\nderived from the E. coli K-12 genome using sRNAscanner and\nGlimmer.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s005 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nFigure S1 Training set-derived PWM1 - PWM3 matrices.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s006 (0.04 MB\nPDF)\nFigure S2 R1 versions of random matrices.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s007 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nFigure S3 R2 versions of random matrices\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s008 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nFigure S4 R3 versions of random matrices.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s009 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nFigure S5 TargetRNA-identified putative sRNA-mRNA inter-\nactions.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s010 (0.07 MB\nPDF)\nFile S1 Details of known and novel sRNAs predicted by\nsRNAscanner in the 13 genomes analysed.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s011 (0.47 MB\nXLS)\nFile S2 Supplementary References.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0011970.s012 (0.03 MB\nPDF)\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Ziauddin Ahamed Rafi\nwho was the inspiration behind this study.
