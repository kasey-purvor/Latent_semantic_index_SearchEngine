Perhaps the most\ndramatic consequence of the defect is persistent photocon-\nductivity where illumination at low temperatures produces a\nchange in conductivity that persists at low temperatures after\nthe illumination is removed. It is generally accepted that the\nDX centers are an intrinsic property of the donor impurities\nthat can be described by a \u201clarge lattice relaxation negative U\nmodel.\u201d5\u20137 In this model the neutral donor state can reduce\nits energy by trapping an extra electron coupled with a large\nbond breaking displacement of the donor atom.8 The DX\ncenter can be described by the charge exchange reaction\n2d0\u2192 d+ + DX\u2212, \u00011\u0002\nwhere d0 and d+ represent neutral and ionized shallow donor\nstates, respectively. DX-like centers have also been demon-\nstrated to exist in the II-VI compound CdTe, doped with\ndonors from groups III and VII, both under hydrostatic\npressure9 and when alloyed with zinc.10,11 More recently, it\nwas shown that donor-doped CdTe alloyed with\nmanganese12,13 also exhibited the characteristic persistent\nphotoconductivity of a DX-like system.\nOne issue relating to the DX center that is still largely\nunresolved is that concerning its magnetic state. Equation \u00011\u0002\nsuggests that the DX\u2212 state is a singlet while the d0 donor is\na doublet. ESR measurements14 support this picture with a\nsignal being enhanced after illuminating at low temperatures.\nHowever, high sensitivity SQUID magnetometry\nmeasurements15 provide no convincing evidence for a mo-\nment change upon exciting the semiconductor into a persis-\ntent photoconducting state. DC-SQUID measurements made\non Cd1\u2212xMnxTe1\u2212ySey : In16 were used to infer a singlet\nground state of the DX-like center, following the observation\nof bound magnetic polarons only after illuminating into the\npersistently conducting state. However, such an observation\ncannot be taken as unambiguous proof of a singlet ground\nstate of the DX-like center: electrons bound to such an ener-\ngetically \u201cdeep\u201d state would be expected to be strongly lo-\ncalized and hence unlikely to form large magnetic polarons,\neven if in a doublet state. Thus, a doublet state to doublet\nstate transition after illumination would not be inconsistent\nwith the results of Ref. 16. In light of this unresolved feature\nof DX centers, we have utilized muon spin relaxation \u0001\u0001SR\u0002,\ntogether with bulk dc SQUID magnetic measurements, to\ninvestigate the magnetic properties of a material containing\nDX-like centers. We have chosen to investigate the dilute\nmagnetic semiconductor CdMnTe \u0001CMT\u0002 that is known to\nexhibit a spin glass behavior at compositions x\u00030.01,17 with\na freezing temperature that increases with increasing manga-\nnese content. Muons have been found to be a useful probe of\nthe spin glass behavior of CMT with x\u00040.2.18\u201321 We inves-\ntigate samples below the spin glass percolation limit \u0001x\n\u00050.2\u0002, moreover we observe the DX center perturbing the\nimplanted muon environment. The CMT samples were\ndoped with either indium or aluminum atoms as the former\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 054421 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/73\u00015\u0002\/054421\u00016\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society054421-1\ndopant has been shown to form DX-like centers22,23 while\nthe latter is expected to behave only as a shallow donor\nlevel.9,23 We show that the implantation of positively charged\nmuons, which are local probes of magnetism, is affected by\nthe presence of these deep centers. Moreover, the \u0001SR data\nprovide strong evidence for the diamagnetic nature of the\nground state of the defect, and for the possible existence of\nmultiple DX centers.\nBulk single crystals of CMT doped with indium and alu-\nminium were grown using the vertical Bridgman technique.\nThe crystals were annealed in a cadmium atmosphere to re-\nduce cadmium vacancies that act as compensating centers.\nTwo n-type samples were produced for this study, one of\neach dopant type with the indium-doped sample \u0001I1\u0002 having\na Mn fraction of 0.15, determined by EDAX measurements,\nand the aluminium \u0001A1\u0002 sample with a Mn composition of\n0.14. Standard four terminal dc resistivity measurements\nwere performed on each sample from 4\u2013290 K to determine\nif the samples exhibit the PPC effect. The bulk magnetic\nmeasurements were carried out upon an Oxford Instruments\n\u0001OI\u0002 helium 3 system modified to include a Quantum Design\nDC SQUID with a first-order gradiometer pickup coil con-\nfiguration. This setup allowed dc susceptibility measure-\nments to be made in the temperature range 0.350\u20132.5 K in a\nfield of 10 \u0001T, with a magnetic field of up to 0.01 T being\napplied upon cooling. The He3 system also included an in-\nfrared LED operating at 940 nm, to allow for in situ illumi-\nnation of the sample. \u0001SR was carried out at the ISIS labo-\nratory, Oxford, UK upon the beamline EMU. We operated in\nthe \u201cfly-past\u201d mode due to the relatively small sample sizes.\nA bottom-loading OI helium 3 cryostat with a silver sample\nholder was modified to enable direct illumination with a\nLED that has a peak output of 940 nm. In particular, the\nLED was heat sunk to the 1 K pot to enable continuous\nillumination of the sample while at low temperatures. The\nLED was shielded from the muon beam by a silver plate. All\nmeasurements were performed upon samples cut from the\nsame crystal ingots that have been used for electrical and\nmagnetic characterization.\nThe electrical transport data are shown in Fig. 1 for both\nsamples, before and after illumination. Sample I1 was illu-\nminated at 4.2 K until the PPC was saturated. The same il-\nlumination method was applied to A1, but no evidence of\nPPC was observed, even after an extended period of irradia-\ntion. It is obvious under the given experimental conditions\nthat only I1 was excited into a PPC state, indicating the\npresence of DX centers. No centers form in A1 due to the\nsmall distortion in the lattice when doping with Al. Room\ntemperature Hall measurements were performed, giving car-\nrier densities of 1.1\u00061016 cm\u22123 and 2.3\u00061016 cm\u22123 for I1\nand A1, respectively. Resistivity measurements indicate that\nthe shallow donor binding energy for I1 is \u0003220 K and\n\u0003150 K for A1. We observe only one quenching temperature\nat 100 K, however, other investigations into\nCd1\u2212xMnxTe:In22 and Cd1\u2212xZnxTe:Cl24 have recorded an-\nother higher quenching temperature proving the existence of\nmore than one possible deep center, which have been theo-\nretically predicted.23 It is believed that heavy doping levels\nof the crystals could also contribute to multiple DX states.25\nFigure 2 shows the bulk magnetic data of sample A1. The\nsample was field cooled \u0001FC\u0002 from above the spin glass tran-\nsition temperature \u0001Tg\u0002 in 4 and 10 mT and then measured in\nthe remnant field. The remnant field was determined to be\n10 \u0001T, by a calibration of the same sample in the tempera-\nture range 2 to 5 K in a commercial Quantum Design\nMPMS magnetometer. The data indicate a spin glass, with a\nTg of 0.95 K consistent with a Mn fraction of x=0.14, which\nis in good agreement with the EDAX characterization. Our\ndata show that the sample behaves in a similar manner to\nmany of the wide band gap dilute magnetic\nsemiconductors.26\nFigure 3 shows the results of the bulk magnetic suscepti-\nbility measurements of sample I1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 054421 \u00012006\u0002\n054421-2\nwith Tg of 1.06 K, which is in agreement with the literature\nfor a Mn fraction of x=0.15, confirming that I1 has a slightly\nhigher Mn concentration than A1. The derivative of the sus-\nceptibility shows that the effect of inducing PPC appears to\nshift Tg to 1.10 K. Previous measurements have indicated\nthat photoinduced magnetism can make a significant contri-\nbution to the magnetic susceptibility in dilute magnetic\nsemiconductors.16,27 The enhancement has been attributed to\nan increase in the number of bound magnetic polarons that\nare localized around donor atoms. For the case of I1 it is\npossible that the electrons can become localized at shallow\ndonor impurity sites after they are photoexcited from the\ndeep DX center. If the DX center is near Mn atoms that are\npart of the spin glass cluster, it is feasible that these small\nbound magnetic polarons will have an effect upon the spin\nglass freezing temperature.\nWe chose \u0001SR to complement these measurements, as it\nis a sensitive local magnetic probe with which to investigate\nthe spin glass transition. The muon beam is spin polarized\nwith each muon carrying a positive charge. The pulsed na-\nture of the ISIS facility means that approximately 500 muons\nenter the sample every 20 ms, all of which decay before the\nnext pulse arrives. Electronic dipole calculations suggest the\nmuons will sit at an interstital site in CdMnTe, in agreement\nwith previous work.18 Figure 4 shows a typical relaxation\nabove Tg \u0001T=1.5 K\u0002 in both samples along with the fit, de-\ntails of which will be described later in the paper. The first\nobservation is that the relaxation functions required to fit the\ndata will be different, immediately suggesting that the muon\nsite is different in the two samples. Thus, the nature of the\ndonor clearly has a major impact upon the muon relaxation.\nThe specific form of relaxation for each sample did not\nchange over the entire temperature range studied. The ob-\nserved relaxation is from muonium; transverse field measure-\nments indicate a diamagnetic muon fraction consistent with\nthe background levels obtained for each sample, as identified\nin Fig. 4. The application of a 10 mT longitudinal field above\nthe spin glass transition temperature produces starkly differ-\nent results. For A1 the relaxation is partially decoupled, in-\ndicating a possible dynamic relaxation, as is expected for a\nmaterial just above Tg. However, for I1 the sample is fully\ndecoupled at the same temperature in the same field, indicat-\ning the importance of the In doping on the relaxation. This\nfurther suggests that the muon sites are different for both\nsamples, indicating the importance of the DX center. The\nmeasurements described below were carried out in the zero-\nfield configuration.\nFor sample A1 the data were fitted over the entire tem-\nperature range with a relaxation function Gz\u0001t\u0002 of the form\nGz\u0001t\u0002 = ALor exp\u0001\u2212 \u0007t\u0002 + Abg, \u00012\u0002\nrepresenting a Lorentzian relaxation plus a background term.\nALor and Abg represent the initial asymmetry of the Lorentz-\nian exponential and the background term, respectively. \u0007 rep-\nresents the muon spin depolarization rate and the fluctuation\nrate that is proportional to the magnetic field distribution\naround the implanted muon and t represents time. Figure 5\nshows the depolarization rate in sample \u0001A1\u0002 with respect to\ntemperature, and it is clear from this that there is a subtle\nchange in relaxation above 0.95 K, coincident with the ob-\nserved spin glass transition in the bulk magnetic susceptibil-\nity shown in Fig. 2. The temperature dependence of the de-\npolarization rate shows no change within the experimental\nerror from 2 to 10 K. ALor and Abg remained constant\nthrough the transition region. Much work has been carried\nout using \u0001SR to examine spin glass transitions, but the\nwork has tended to concentrate upon canonical systems. Al-\nthough the Lorentzian relaxation tends to indicate dilute spin\nsystems, none of the other expected properties were\nobserved.28 Measurements were also carried out under con-\nstant illumination at 0.9 K, but no change in the relaxation\nwas observed. This measurement was essential to confirm\nthe fact that the sample A1 was not affected by subband gap\nradiation, it also doubled as a test, to ensure that under con-\nstant illumination, the temperature did not change. Although\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Magnetic susceptibility as a function of\ntemperature for CdMnTe:In.

The experiments were performed in the zero-field configu-\nration at 1.5 K.\nPROBING THE MAGNETIC GROUND STATE OF THE\u00bc PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 054421 \u00012006\u0002\n054421-3\nthis exact nature of relaxation is not normally observed for a\nspin glass, an unpublished study upon the dilute magnetic\nsemiconductor Cd0.95Mn0.05Te has observed a similar small\nchange in the relaxation at Tg.29 This indicates that the Tg for\nour samples can be used as a marker for the observed mag-\nnetic properties induced by optical excitation.\nThe ZF data of sample I1 was fitted with a relaxation\nfunction of the form\nGz\u0001t\u0002 = AGaus exp\u0004\u2212 \u0001\bt\u00022\u0005 + Abg, \u00013\u0002\nwhere AGaus represents the initial asymmetry of the Gaussian\nsquared relaxation with \b representing the depolarization\nrate of the decay. Initial measurements were made without\nillumination and the results are presented in Fig. 6 \u0001hollow\nsquares\u0002. The results indicate that there is no clear change in\nthe relaxation at Tg \u00011.05 K\u0002, and therefore suggest that the\nimplanted muon is coupled to the DX center, which is\nthought to be diamagnetic. The diamagnetic nature of the DX\ncenter could mean that the coupled muonium is insensitive to\nthe Mn clusters undergoing the spin glass transition.\nWe have already shown that the sample undergoes a\nsubtle change in the bulk magnetization \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 after illumi-\nnating until the PPC is saturated. Therefore we tried to in-\nvestigate this phenomenon using \u0001SR. The sample I1 was\nilluminated at 4 K and subsequently cooled to the base tem-\nperature in the dark. The ZF relaxation was measured in the\ndark; no change in the depolarization rate \u0001\b\u0002 was detected\nbetween 300 mK and 5 K, indicating that the muons could\nstill not observe the known contribution to the magnetic sus-\nceptibility of the photoinduced carriers. This cannot be ex-\nplained by the binding of the muon to a shallow state, as no\nevidence was detected upon the application of a transverse\nfield.30 If the muon couples to the diamagnetic negative U\ncenter to form muonium, it could be insensitive to the Mn\nclusters and cannot be photoexcited under any conditions.\nHere the implanted muon is perturbing the normally well\ncharacterized behavior of a persistent photoconductor. How-\never, there is another possible explanation based on the\npremise that there is more than one type of DX center, in-\ncluding a center that does not contribute to the PPC state. For\nthis particular scenario it is reasonable to assume that there is\na relaxation back into the ground state after an initial excita-\ntion.\nTo elucidate the interaction mechanism between the muon\nand the DX center we continually illuminated the sample\nwhile varying the temperature through the spin glass transi-\ntion region. The results of this measurement are shown in\nFig. 6 \u0001solid squares\u0002, where the relaxation rates were fitted\nwith Eq. \u00013\u0002. The data show a major change in the depolar-\nization rate between 1.05 and 1.1 K, in agreement with the\nTg obtained from the bulk magnetic measurements as dem-\nonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3. We did not see any change in\nAGaus and Abg over the temperature range investigated\n\u00010.350 mK\u20137 K\u0002. The experimental procedure of constant\nillumination from the LED that was heat sunk to the 1 K pot\nmeant we had a much shorter stability time for the cryostat,\nleading to reduced statistics, hence the increase in the error\nbar size. However, there is a discernible difference in the\nmuon depolarization above and below the spin glass transi-\ntion.\nIt is clear from the measured relaxation rate \u0001\b\u0002 that the\nmuonium coupling is intrinsic to the observation of the spin\nglass transition, and we suggest that the positively charged\nmuon coupled directly to the DX\u2212 center. This leads to the\nconclusion that both before and after excitation into the PPC\nstate the muons are still relaxing close to a deep center that\ndoes not detect the magnetic transition. Such a model indi-\ncates that not all the DX centers are being photoexcited into\nthe shallow donor state and only under continuous illumina-\ntion are all electrons excited out of their deeply bound state\nand experience the host magnetism. The muon results also\nsuggest that some electrons are recaptured, indicating there\nare some centers that do not contribute to the PPC state. This\nrecombination rate is clearly of the order of microseconds, as\nthe muons can detect a subtle change in the local magnetic\nstructure, as under constant illumination they are not bound\nto the deep state.\nPark and Chadi23 have predicted that multiple DX centers\nin CdTe, ZnTe, and Cd1\u2212xZnxTe when doped with group VII\nFIG. 5.

However, the same model predicts that only one DX\ncenter will exist when doped with a group III element such\nas In. Leighton et al.22 have noted that the very high quench-\ning temperature \u0001190 K\u0002 of the PPC, they see for\nCd0.9Mn0.1Te: In suggests the existence of another DX cen-\nter. Indeed, much work on Al1\u2212xGaxAs31 has suggested that\ncenters with different binding energies can arise because of\nthe sensitivity of the impurity center of its local atomic en-\nvironment. The number of Mn ions surrounding a donor will\naffect the actual binding energy \u0001Ei\u0002 of the DX center, which\nshould be labeled according to the number of Mn \u0001i\u0002 ions\nsurrounding the impurity center, where i=0,1 ,2 ,3. Using a\nsimilar statistical argument as other work,22 and assuming no\nMn clustering, we find that, for x=0.14, the probability of\nobtaining a center with i=0, 1, 2, or 3 Mn atoms as 55%,\n37%, 5.7%, and 2.3%, respectively. So far the experimental\nevidence has only pointed to two possible deep centers, this\nhas been explained by the low probability of finding the high\nMn environment. However, our results suggest that the muon\nis susceptible to any DX center relaxation after excitation,\nleading to the situation where the implanted muon could be\nsurrounded by two or three Mn ions. This could explain why\nthe form of muon relaxation is different between A1 and I1;\nmuon decay in I1 would not be in a dilute environment and\nhence explain the Gaussian relaxation.\nA recent theoretical study in CdTe32 citing experimental\nwork that demonstrates a high In concentration \u00011021 cm\u22123\u0002,\nhas demonstrated that during illumination not all the DX\ncenters can be transformed because the substitutional con-\nfiguration becomes energetically unfavorable at a certain\nconcentration of electrons in the conduction band. It has\nbeen predicted only a concentration of 1018 cm\u22123 DX centers\ncan be photoexcited. Our results indicate that under illumi-\nnation all the electrons from all the deep centers are excited\ninto the conduction band, however, a certain proportion of\nthe electrons recombine to form a DX\u2212 center \u0001in a time of\napproximately 10 \u0001s\u0002, leading to a situation where constant\nillumination has to be applied to detect the spin glass transi-\ntion. We suggest that the electrons will recombine with pre-\nviously unobserved DX centers.\nThe large negative U model also predicts that the DX\u2212\ncenter is diamagnetic; this is a direct consequence of Eq. \u00011\u0002,\nas two electrons will pair with opposite spin. When the im-\nplanted muon is tightly bound to the DX\u2212 center, no mag-\nnetic transition is visible, however under photoexcitation we\nobserve Tg, as the muons are no longer tightly bound. Previ-\nous work has concentrated on the influence of the deep cen-\nter on the bulk magnetic properties,14,15,33,34 however, we\nhave used a local probe \u0001\u00032 nm\u0002 concentrated around the\ndeep center to detect its magnetic properties and provide\nstrong evidence for the diamagnetic nature of the DX center\nground state. Again, it is essential to note that we have also\ncarried out work on a sample \u0001A1\u0002 without a DX center with\nnominally the same Mn concentration, indicating the impor-\ntance of the deep center upon the implantation site.\nIn conclusion, we have evidence to suggest that muons\nare attracted to DX\u2212 centers and the muon becomes a local\nmagnetic probe of the deep center. We have carried out the\nfirst local measurements, indicating the diamagnetic nature\nof the ground state of the DX\u2212 center. We have also proved\nthat there is more than one possible DX\u2212 center that has\nbefore been experimentally observed and theoretically pre-\ndicted, however, the previous measurements have only been\nable to distinguish centers that participate in PPC. From our\nmeasurements it has been possible to prove that there are\nmore DX\u2212 centers that do not participate in the PPC effect,\nleading to the situation where this could possibly explain the\nlack of the expected photoinduced carriers.35\nWe thank A.
