Following\nMetcalfe et al. (1996) we show that simple Bruzual & Charlot evolutionary models\nwhich assume exponentially increasing star-formation rates with look-back time and\nq0=0.05 continue to give excellent fits to galaxy counts and colours in the deep imaging\ndata. With q0=0.5, an extra population of \u2018disappearing dwarf\u2019 galaxies is required\nto fit the optical counts.\nWe further find that the (r \u2212 i) : (b \u2212 r) colour-colour diagrams show distinctive\nfeatures corresponding to two populations of early- and late-type galaxies which are\nwell fitted by features in the Bruzual & Charlot models. The (r\u2212 i) : (b\u2212 r) data also\nsuggest the existence of an intrinsically faint population of early-types at z \u223c 0.1 with\nsimilar properties to the \u2018disappearing dwarf\u2019 population required if q0=0.5.\nThe outstanding issue remaining for the early-type models is the dwarf-dominated\nIMF which we invoke to reduce the numbers of z > 1 galaxies predicted at K < 19.\nFor the spiral models, the main issue is that even with the inclusion of internal dust\nabsorption at the AB = 0.3 mag level, the model predicts too blue (u\u2212 b) colours for\nlate-type galaxies at z \u223c 1. Despite these possible problems, we conclude that these\nsimple models with monotonically increasing star-formation rates broadly fit the data\nto z \u223c 3.\nWe compare these results for the star formation rate history with those from the\ndifferent approach of Madau et al. (1996). We conclude that when the effects of internal\ndust absorption in spirals are taken into account the results from this latter approach\nare completely consistent with the \u03c4=9Gyr, exponentially rising star formation rate\ndensity out to z \u2248 3 which fits the deepest, optical\/IR galaxy count and colour data.\nWhen we compare the observed and predicted galaxy counts for UV dropouts in\nthe range 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 from the data of Steidel et al. (1999), Madau et al. (1996) and\nnew data from the Herschel and HDF-S fields, we find excellent agreement, indicating\nthat the space density of galaxies may not have changed much between z = 0 and\nz = 3 and identifying the Lyman break galaxies with the bright end of the evolved\nspiral luminosity function. Making the same comparison for B dropout galaxies in the\nrange 3.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.5 we find that the space density of intrinsically bright galaxies\nremains the same but the space density of faint galaxies drops by a factor of \u223c5,\nconsistent with the idea that L\u2217 galaxies were already in place at z \u2248 4 but that dwarf\ngalaxies may have formed later at 3 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.\nKey words: galaxies: evolution - galaxies: photometry - cosmology: observations\n\u22c6 Present address: LAS, Traverse du Siphon, Les Trois Lucs, F-\n13102 Marseille, France\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIn four previous papers, Jones et al. (1991) (hereafter Paper\nI), Metcalfe et al. (1991) (hereafter Paper II), Metcalfe et al.\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS\n2 N. Metcalfe, et al.\n(1995a) (hereafter Paper III) and McCracken et al. (2000)\n(hereafter Paper IV), we used photographic and CCD data\nto study the form of the galaxy number-magnitude relation\nat both optical (B \u223c 27.5) and infra-red (K \u223c 20) wave-\nlengths. In this paper we extend our observations of the B-\nband field of paper III to even deeper magnitudes (B \u223c 28\nmag), and over a much larger area of 7\u2032\u00d77\u2032, by exposing for\na total of 30 hours over five nights with the Tektronix CCD\nat the prime focus of the 4.2 metre William Herschel tele-\nscope (WHT). We have also acquired \u223c 34 hours of exposure\nin the U -band (to U \u223c 27 mag), 8 hours in the R-band (to\nR \u223c 26.5 mag) and 5 hours in the I-band (to I \u223c 25.5 mag)\non the same field, again with the WHT. We refer to this field\nthroughout as the William Herschel Deep Field (WHDF).\nAlthough not competing in terms of either collecting\narea or field of view with these ground-based observations,\nthe high resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope offers\nthe ability to image sub-arcsecond objects to much greater\ndepths than can be done from the ground. The Hubble Deep\nField (HDF) project (Williams et al. 1996) has provided such\na dataset in the public domain, and here we present our anal-\nysis of the F300W , F450W , F606W and F814W prelimi-\nnary release North (HDF-N) and South (HDF-S) fields, us-\ning similar data reduction techniques as for the WHT data.\nRoughly speaking, these passbands correspond to U , B, R\n& I (see section 4.2). For unresolved objects the 3\u03c3 limit of\nB \u223c 29.5 mag on the F450W image is considerably deeper\nthan our WHT frame. However, for resolved galaxies this\nlimit is much brighter. Indeed, for sources more extended\nthan the WHT \u2018seeing\u2019 disk (\u223c 1.25\u2032\u2032 radius) the ground-\nbased frame is slightly deeper, making it an ideal comple-\nment to the HST images. A similar situation exists between\ntheWHT u and the HDF F300W frames, where, for a source\nat the WHT seeing limit, the WHT is actually over 0.5 mag\ndeeper than the HDF. The same is not true for the F606W\nand F814W images, which are 2-3 mag deeper (for typical\ngalaxy sizes) than the deepest previous R and I-band galaxy\ncounts (Smail et al. 1995, Hogg et al. 1997).\nThe modelling and interpretation of HDF-N data has\nbeen discussed briefly elsewhere (Metcalfe et al. 1996). Here\nwe discuss the data reduction for both ground- and space-\nbased data, and present the number counts, colour distri-\nbutions and models in greater detail. Finally we discuss the\ncomparison between the models and the data.\nThe optical - infra-red properties of the WHDF, based\non infra-red imaging data to K \u223c 20 taken on the United\nKingdom Infrared Telescope, and data to K \u223c 23 on one\nsmaller, 1.8\u2032 \u00d7 1.8\u2032 area, are discussed in Paper IV.\nWe now also have infra-red imaging data covering the\nwhole of our WHDF to H \u223c 22.5 mag taken with the \u2126\nPrime camera on the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope. This data\nwill be discussed in a subsequent paper (McCracken et. al.,\nin prep.).\n2 THE OBSERVATIONS\n2.1 New WHT observations\nOur data were taken during four observing runs at WHT\nprime focus; one of 5 nights in September 1994 during which\nall of the b-band data and about 3hrs of r-band data were\nFigure 1. Filter\/detector throughputs for the HDF (dashed\nlines) and WHDF (solid lines) observations. The WHDF curves\ninclude the effects of La Palma extinction.\nacquired, a further run of 4 nights in September 1995 dur-\ning which the remaining r-band data and some of the u-\nband data were collected, and 3 nights in both October\n1996 and September 1997 when the rest of the u-band ex-\nposures and all the i-band data were taken. Observing con-\nditions were much better in 1994, when 4 out of 5 nights\nwere photometric, than in 1995 or 1996, when the observa-\ntions were affected by dust and poor seeing. The 1997 run,\nalthough not completely photometric, had good seeing of\n\u2248 1\u2032\u2032 FWHM. For the 1994 and 1995 runs we used the Tek-\ntronix CCD camera at WHT prime focus, giving a field size\nof 7.17\u2032\u00d77.17\u2032 at a scale of 0.42\u2032\u2032 per pixel. The gain was set\nto 1.7e\u2212\/ADU and the read-noise is about 7e\u2212. However, in\n1996 we switched to a Loral CCD, with 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels\nat a scale of 0.26\u2032\u2032 per pixel and a gain of 1.22e\u2212\/ADU . In\n1997 we again used a Loral CCD (although not the same\nchip as in 1996); this time the gain was set to 1e\u2212\/ADU .\nThese chips have a much higher (about a factor of three)\nshort wavelength response than the Tek CCD, as a result\nof which most of our u-band signal comes from the 1996\/7\ndata.\nThe Harris B, R and I filters were used - these are much\ncloser to the standard photoelectric bands (throughout, any\nreferences to standard photoelectric R and I magnitudes\nimply those on the Kron-Cousins system) than the KPNO\nfilters used in papers II and III. The U filter was a 50mm\nRGO filter, which caused some vignetting at the edges of the\nCCD. The filter response curves can be seen in Fig. 1. To\navoid confusion we use lower-case u, b, r & i to refer to the\npassbands defined by the WHT filter\/detector combination.\nExposures were centred on 00h19m59s.6 +00\u25e604\u203218\u2032\u2032\n(B1950.0). This field encompasses the 24 hour INT and 10\nhour WHT images from paper III, although the centre is\nabout 1.5\u2032 north of that of these previous exposures. Indi-\nvidual u and b-band exposures were usually 2000s, with some\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

These short exposures were\nnecessary in order to avoid saturating the CCDs with the\nbackground sky signal. To avoid excessive atmospheric ex-\ntinction, no u-band frames were taken at an airmass greater\nthan \u223c 1.5, and no b-band frames at greater than \u223c 1.8. The\nr and i-band frames, where extinction is less of a problem,\nwere mostly taken at higher airmass than this. The field was\noffset a few arcseconds in different directions between nights\nin order to avoid dud pixels always falling on the same place\non the sky.

The\neffective exposure times, defined as the equivalent number\nof seconds at the zenith in photometric conditions (with the\nLoral CCD for the u), are given in Table 2. The seeing was\ngood in 1994 and 1997, always less than 2\u2032\u2032 FWHM, and\naround 0.9\u2032\u2032 on some nights, but ranged from 1\u2032\u2032 \u2212 5\u2032\u2032 in\n1995 and 1.3\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2.0\u2032\u2032 in 1996. The images with the worst\nseeing were not used in the data reduction (see section 3.1).\nStandard stars were taken at the beginning and end of each\nnight, as were twilight flat-fields. Standards were also occa-\nsionally taken during the night, although we were also able\nto use our image frames to monitor atmospheric conditions.\n2.2 The Hubble Deep Fields\nFor the HDF-N we use the F300W , F450W , F606W and\nF814W preliminary \u2018drizzled\u2019 WFPC2 images released into\nthe public domain on 1996 January 15 (Williams et al. 1996).\nThese are flat-fielded, cosmic-ray rejected, sky-subtracted\nstacked images, resampled to a scale of 0.04\u2032\u2032\/pixel. Each of\nthe three wide-field WFPC2 chips were analysed separately.\nWe made no attempt to use the data from the PC chip.\nNote that some 25% of the observations are not included in\nthe F450W images and an optimal weighting scheme was\nnot used for stacking these data, nor for the F300W data.\nFor the HDF-S we use the combined WFPC2 images re-\nleased in November 1998. We have also analysed the un-\nfiltered STIS QSO field image. For unresolved objects the\neffective FWHM is \u223c 0.15\u2032\u2032 (see Williams et al. 1996).\n3 WILLIAM HERSCHEL DEEP FIELD\n3.1 Data reduction\nA detailed description of our data reduction procedures can\nbe found in Paper III. Briefly, a master bias frame is formed\nfrom a median of many individual bias exposures and nor-\nmalised to the bias level in the overscan region of each ex-\nposure. This bias frame is then subtracted. The resulting\nframes are then trimmed to remove the overscan and divided\nby a master flat-field, formed from the median of all the flat\nfields in the relevant filter throughout the run. Cosmic rays\nare removed by comparing each pixel in each frame with the\nmean and standard deviation in that pixel over all other ex-\nposures (where necessary, normalised and re-scaled) taken\nthat night. Any pixels more than 4.5\u03c3 away from that mean\nare replaced by the mean of the surrounding 5 \u00d7 5 pixels\nin the image being cleaned. Finally, each image is inspected\nvisually on the computer and any remaining blemishes (e.g.\nsatellite trails) removed interactively. All the individual im-\nages are then registered with one another to the nearest\ninteger pixel shift by doing a pixel-pixel cross-correlation\nbetween images. They are then added together. Frames on\nwhich the seeing was equal to or greater than 2.0\u2032\u2032 FWHM\nwere discarded.\nThe final b-band image is 998\u00d7 991 pixels (7.0\u2032 \u00d7 6.9\u2032)\nand has a sky surface brightness of 21.9 mag\/arcsec2 . The\nseeing is \u223c 1.25\u2032\u2032 FWHM (as in papers II and III this is\njudged by comparison with a simulated Moffat profile (Mof-\nfat 1969)).\nThe final r-band image has 986\u00d7966 pixels (6.9\u2032\u00d76.8\u2032)\nand has a sky brightness of 20.0 mag\/arcsec2 . There was\na slight rotational shift between the 1994 and 1995 data\nwhich was corrected for using the shear technique described\nin paper III. The seeing on this frame is \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 FWHM.\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n4 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nThe 1995, 1996 and 1997 u-band data were reduced sep-\narately. The 1995 data were then resampled to 0.26\u2032\u2032\/pixel\nand, along with the 1996 data, shear-rotated slightly in or-\nder to match the 1997 data. There was a problem with the\nLoral CCD used in 1997 in that it had a \u223c 5% non-linear re-\nsponse at low signal levels. This posed a particular problem\nfor u-band deep field data frames, where even in 2000 sec\nexposures the sky levels were low. Extensive exposure tests\nwere carried out with a dome lamp to enable a correction\nfactor as a function of count rate to be determined. This was\nthen applied to the data. As a check on this procedure one\nstandard star field was repeated with a series of exposure\ntimes, and detailed comparisons made between stars cover-\ning a range of magnitudes on our field in 1997 and 1995\/6.\nIn fact, the uncorrected and corrected standards gave the\nsame zero-point to within 0.01 mag (as expected, as most of\nthe light from these stars comes at high count rates where\nthe non-linear correction is negligible). However, the correc-\ntion did improve the relation between the 1995\/6 and 1997\ndata frames, removing a \u223c 0.05 mag non-linearity between\nbright and faint stars. The three datasets were then stacked\ntogether (with appropriate weighting to allow for the differ-\nent gain factors, signal strength and sky levels) and all the\nimage analysis was done on this final combined frame, which\nencompasses 1593\u00d71582 pixels (6.9\u2032\u00d76.9\u2032) with a \u2018seeing\u2019 of\n\u2248 1.35\u2032\u2032 FWHM. The sky brightness was 21.5 mag\/arcsec2 .\nThe 1996 and 1997 i-band data were also reduced sep-\narately. The non-linearity in the 1997 Loral CCD was not\na problem for the i data, as the sky levels were well into\nthe linear regime (and as we found for u data the zero-point\nfrom the standards was not affected). As a result no correc-\ntion was applied. However, an extra problem with all the\ni-band data was the presence of fringing. To remove this it\nwas necessary to create a master fringe frame by taking the\nmedian of all the data-frames. This was then scaled to suit\neach individual frame (by trial and error) and subtracted.\nA small amount of rotation and pixel rescaling (\u223c1%) were\nrequired before the two runs could be stacked together. The\nfinal i-band image has 1622 \u00d7 1747 pixels (7.0\u2032 \u00d7 7.6\u2032) and\na sky brightness of 18.9 mag\/arcsec2 . It has the best seeing\nof all our data, with a FWHM of only 1.2\u2032\u2032.\nBoth the present b-band data and our 26hr INT prime\nfocus CCD data from paper III cover the \u223c 2\u2032 diameter\narea observed for 10hrs with the WHT auxiliary focus CCD\ncamera (paper III). By stacking all three together in the\ncommon area we have been able to create an ultra-deep im-\nage. To achieve this the INT and WHT auxiliary images\nwere rotated, again using the shear technique described in\npaper III, and resampled to the same pixel scale as the WHT\nprime image. The three were then registered to one pixel ac-\ncuracy and added. The resulting image is 243 \u00d7 240 pixels\n(1.7\u2032 \u00d7 1.7\u2032) (as the WHT auxiliary image was circular, the\neffective exposure time is lower in the corners). The ratios\nof number of electrons detected in each separate image from\nan object are; 3.06 : 1.03 : 1.0 (WHT prime : WHT aux.\n: INT prime). The stacked image is therefore equivalent to\n1.7\u00d7 the WHT prime exposure, i.e. \u223c 46hrs of 4-m time,\nand is \u223c 0.3 mag deeper. Fig. 2 shows a sky-subtracted sur-\nface brightness contour plot of this co-added image, with a\ngeometric progression of levels starting at 1000ADU (29.4\nmag\/arcsec2) and rising by factors of two.\nAlthough not adding to the discussion of counts and\nFigure 2. Isophotal contour plot for the 50 hour co-added b-\nband data. Contours start at 29.4 mag\/arcsec2 and rise in 0.75\nmag steps.\ncolours in this paper, this small field has the advantage of\nhaving been the subject of a 30 hourK-band exposure taken\nwith IRCAM3 camera (which has an almost identical field\nof view) at UKIRT. Thses data, and a detailed analysis of\nthe (b\u2212K) colour distribution, has been presented elsewhere\n(Paper IV).\nTable 1 lists the parameters of all our final images.\n3.2 Calibration\nZero-points for our data were provided by observations of\nequatorial standard star fields from Landolt (1992). Mostly\nthey were observed close to the meridian. The CCD field of\nview is large enough to see 5 \u223c 10 standards on a Landolt\nfield in a single exposure.\nAs all our WHDF frames are on the same field we adopt\nthe procedure of calibrating all the frames (in each run) in\none band relative to ones taken on the meridian on pho-\ntometric nights. This is done by comparing magnitudes for\na selection of bright (but not saturated) objects. The stan-\ndard stars observations then provide an absolute calibration.\nAs the airmass of the standards and of the WHDF on the\nmeridian are very similar, this way we are not sensitive to\nairmass extinction coefficients. In fact, by fitting a sec z law\nto the relative magnitudes of objects on our WHDF field\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 5\nthroughout a night\u2019s observations, we were able to derive\natmospheric extinction coefficients appropriate to each run\nand hence apply relative airmass corrections to those stan-\ndards not observed at the meridian.\nWhere possible, colour equations measured during the\nrun are used to convert the standards to the \u2018natural\u2019 CCD\nbands (which agree with standard UBRI for objects with\nzero colour) and the magnitudes and colours we measure for\ngalaxies are in these \u2018natural\u2019 systems, which we designate\nuccd, bccd, rccd and iccd (although, as we shall see below,\nthese are very close to the standard photoelectric bands).\nThe bccd and rccd magnitudes from the Tek CCD used\nin 1994 suffered a minor problem in that our observed stan-\ndard star magnitudes appeared to be correlated with expo-\nsure time (at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude).\nAfter consultation with the RGO (T. Bridges, priv. comm.)\nit became apparent that a small additive shutter timing cor-\nrection was necessary for the WHT prime focus camera. The\nmagnitude of this correction was dependent on zenith angle,\nbeing \u223c +0.05s for most of our standards. Applying this\nsignificantly reduced the scatter between the observed and\ncatalogued magnitudes, and the following colour equations\nwere determined from n observations of 28 stars:\nbccd = B \u2212 0.012(B \u2212R) (n = 73)\nrccd = R (n = 65)\nThe rms scatter about the B and R relations was\n\u00b10.014 mag. The range in colour covered was \u22120.5 <\n(B \u2212 R) < 2.5. Fig 3 shows examples of the data on which\nthese relations were based.\nIn 1995 only one night was demonstrably photometric\nand this was used to calibrate our data independently from\nthe 1994 observations. Again we found rccd = R, with a scat-\nter of \u00b10.009 mag from measurements of 23 standards.The\nrccd zero-point deduced from this gave magnitudes on the\nWHDF which agreed to within 0.02 mag in the mean from\nthose found in 1994. Note that no shutter correction was ap-\nplied to this data, as a series of test exposures ranging from\n1s to 20s were taken sequentially on the same field during\nphotometric conditions and no dependence of the zero-point\non exposure time was present down to the 0.01 mag level.\nThe data from the uccd and iccd standards (whether\ntaken with Tek or Loral CCD between 1995 and 1997) show\na significantly higher scatter than the bccd or rccd data. The\nreasons for this are not clear; airmass corrections are not\nthe cause because, as already noted, all the standards were\ntaken at very similar airmass - also the effect exists between\nstandards on the same CCD image and is not due to varia-\ntions from night to night (or within a single night).\nAll the 1995 u-band data were tied to the one photo-\nmetric night, although frequent standards were taken every\nnight (the maximum variation in zero-point from night-to-\nnight was 0.2 mag), and we were able to utilise most of these\nto derive an approximate colour equation of\nuTek \u2248 U \u2212 0.1(U \u2212B) (n = 96)\nvalid for \u22121.5 < (U\u2212B) < 2.5, with a scatter of \u00b10.08 mag,\nexcluding two standards whose magnitudes were confirmed\nFigure 3. Example standard star calibration plots (catalogue\ncolour versus observed - catalogue magnitude) for the WHT u,\nb, r and i bands. The dotted lines indicate the adopted colour\nequations.\nby repeat measurements to be \u223c 0.4 mag off the mean line.\nFig 3 shows these data.\nThe 1996 and 1997 u-band standards taken with the Lo-\nral CCD showed a similar scatter with respect to the Landolt\nmagnitudes of \u223c \u00b10.10 mag. This excludes the two stan-\ndards which were discrepant in the 1995 Tek data, which\nwere again found to be off by \u223c 0.4 mag. Significantly, if\nwe compare frames with several standards on taken both\nin 1996 and 1997, the scatter between the 1996 and 1997\ndata was only \u00b10.03 mag. A similar exercise between fields\nin common to 1995 and 1996\/7 datasets gave \u00b10.06 mag.\nThe Loral data do not show a colour term as large as the\n0.1(U \u2212B) found for the Tek data, and the scatter prevents\nany reliable estimate of a shallower relation. However, the\nstandards on fields in common between the Tek and Loral\nobservations indicate that there is a significant colour term\nbetween these two CCDs. We estimate this as\nuTek \u2212 uLoral \u2248 \u22120.07(U \u2212B) (n = 25)\nwhich reduces the scatter to \u00b10.04 mag. As the 1996\/7 data\ndominate the stacked image in terms of signal-to-noise we\nadopt a colour equation of\nuccd \u2248 U \u2212 0.03(U \u2212B)\nas appropriate for our final dataset (for \u22121.5 > (U \u2212 B) >\n2.5).\nAlthough there is clearly some uncertainty in the uccd\nzero-point, when the 1995, 1996 and 1997 WHDF data were\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n6 N. Metcalfe, et al.\ncalibrated and reduced independently, the magnitude scales\nagreed to within 0.03 mag.\nThe scatter in the iccd-band standards (\u00b10.10 mag)\nappears partly due to non-photometric variations on some\nnights (especially in 1997) at the 0.05 mag level. There is also\nsome evidence of inaccuracies in some of the fainter Landolt\nstandards on the fields we used (and many of the brighter\nstandards were unusable due to saturation), as standards on\none field taken in both 1996 and 1997 show the same offsets\nwith respect to the Landolt magnitudes (up to 0.2 mag, with\nno correlation with colour), and a scatter of < 0.01 mag be-\ntween the two years. Fig. 3 shows the data from 1997. As a\nresult of these uncertainties, and the short colour range in\n(V \u2212 I), we make no attempt to fit a colour equation but\njust assume iccd = I .\nFortunately, in 1995 we observed an area encompass-\ning the WHDF in the I-band with a Tek CCD on the INT\n2.5m telescope. These independent data show an offset of\nonly \u223c 0.04 mag with the WHT data, giving us confidence\nin our zero-point (although any possible problems with the\nstandard magnitudes would affect these data as well).\n3.3 Image analysis\nOur procedure is very similar to that used in Papers I-IV\n(note that the data in each passband are reduced indepen-\ndently); the sky background is removed and images are de-\ntected isophotally using the limits given in Table 2. These\nimages are then removed from the frame, replaced by a local\nsky value, and the resulting frame smoothed heavily before\nbeing subtracted from the original. This produces a very\nflat background. The isophotal detection is then repeated.\nIn order to reduce false detections, images whose centres lie\nonly two pixels apart are recombined into one single image.\nA Kron-type pseudo-total magnitude is then calculated for\neach image, using a local value of sky.\nOne complication with both our u-band and b-band ex-\nposures was the presence of scattered light (at the 1% level\nin b and 10% in u) on one side of the field. This had a sharp\nedge which proved difficult to remove by the above back-\nground flattening technique. It therefore proved necessary\nto remove this interactively from the frame.\nTable 2 shows the limiting isophotes and magnitudes\nfor our isophotal detection routine and the minimum radius,\nradius multiplying factor (see paper III) and correction to\ntotal magnitude for our Kron magnitudes. As in our pre-\nvious papers the minimum radius is set to be that for an\nunresolved image of high signal-to-noise, and the correction\nto total is the light outside this minimum radius for such\nan image. Our measurement limits (table 1) give the total\nmagnitudes of unresolved objects which are a 3\u03c3 detection\ninside the minimum radius.\nAs in paper III we measure fixed aperture colours. For\nall the WHT data we use an aperture of 1.5\u2032\u2032 radius, and\ncorrect the measured colours for the difference in \u2018seeing\u2019\nbetween the different bands (this is a small effect, and is es-\ntimated from inspection of stellar profiles). Images detected\nin one band are matched with those detected in the other\nwithin \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 of the position in the first band. Any multi-\nple matches which occur are decided by visual inspection. If\neither image is below the 3\u03c3 magnitude measurement limit\nfor that band then no colour is measured.\nFigure 4.

We find a scatter in (B \u2212R) rising from \u223c \u00b10.1 mag\nfor 22 < B < 24 mag to \u223c \u00b10.5 mag for 25 < B < 26\nmag. The much noisier INT data will, of course, dominate\nthe scatter.\n3.4 Star\/galaxy separation\nStar-galaxy separation was done on the b-band frame using\nthe difference between the total magnitude and that inside\na 1\u2032\u2032 aperture, as described in paper II. This enabled us to\nseparate to b \u223c 24 mag. Some additional very red stars were\nidentified from the r and i frames in similar fashion.\nThe colours of the stars can be used as an external,\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

Fig. 4\nshows the (U \u2212B) : (B \u2212R) and (R\u2212 I) : (B \u2212R) colour-\ncolour diagrams for the unsaturated stars on our frames.\nAlso shown are the colours of the Landolt (1992) standard\nstars. The agreement between the stellar loci is at the 0.1\nmag level or better for all the colours. We note that we have\nno stars on the giant branch and that nearly all our stars are\ntype G or later. There are, however, quite a sizeable num-\nber of stars which lie well away from the expected locus, in\nthe sense that for their (B \u2212 R) colour they are too blue\nin (U \u2212 B) and, sometimes, too red in (R \u2212 I). Visual in-\nspection reveals that most of these are isolated objects (so\nnot errors due to confusion), and their appearance concurs\nwith their automated identification as stellar. They tend to\nbe amongst the fainter stars identified. These may be very\ncompact galaxies, subdwarfs or QSO\u2019s.\n3.5 Comparison with our previous published data\nIn Fig. 5 we show the comparisons between our B and R INT\ndata from paper III and our new data on this field. Colour\ncorrections have been included to put all the data onto the\nstandard photoelectric system. We find for the mean offset\nand rms scatter for over 500 objects\nB(wht)\u2212B(int) = \u22120.10\u00b1 0.20 B < 25\nR(wht)\u2212R(int) = \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.19 R < 23.5\nIt is clear that there is significant offset between the\nnew and old data, in the sense that the new magnitudes are\nbrighter.\nWe have made a detailed comparison with our original\nshort exposures on this field (paper II), both for aperture\nmagnitudes and for Kron total magnitudes, in order to de-\ntermine the source of this discrepancy. It would appear that\nthe major problem comes from an error in the exposure time\nrecorded in the header of one of the original B CCD frames\non this field described in Paper II. This accounts for 0.06\nmag, and propagates to the Paper III data, as this was cali-\nbrated using the results from Paper II. The remaining offset\nFigure 5.

Whenever subsequently referred to, these data have been\ncorrected by this amount. As the counts in Paper II were an\naverage of 12 fields, and the timing error was only present\non the one frame, these results are unaffected at the 0.01\nmag level.\n3.6 Completeness corrections and simulations\nThe deeper the ground-based number-counts are pushed\nthe more important the corrections for confusion and in-\ncompleteness become. The magnitude limits in Table 1 are\njust theoretical calculated values for isolated images and are\nbased on measured sky noise, and take no account of the\nefficiency of the detection procedure or the effects of confu-\nsion. To make a better estimate of the completeness of our\ncounts we have added numerous artificial stars of various\nknown magnitudes to our real data frames and subjected\nthem to the normal data reduction procedure. Fig. 6 shows\nthe distribution of measured magnitudes for these stars for\nthe 30hr b-band data. Table 3 gives the mean magnitudes,\nscatter, and detection rate for this data and for the stacked\nb-band frame and the r-, u- and i-band frames. Note that\nan image is considered undetected if it is merged with an-\nother image and the combined brightness is a factor two or\nmore greater than its true magnitude, or if it is not found\nwithin \u00b12 (Tek) or \u00b13 (Loral) pixels of its true position.\nAs expected the detection rates in the real data drop as the\nmagnitude becomes fainter. This is almost entirely due to\nimages being merged with other, brighter images. Hence the\nhigher detection rates in both the r-band and the i-band\ndata, where the density of objects is lower, despite the sim-\nilar signal-to-noise ratios.\nAlthough the above procedure gives a reasonable es-\ntimate of the measurement of real images it tells us little\nabout whether we are losing low surface brightness, extended\ngalaxies, and nothing about the number of false detections\nwe may pick up. Some of these may be genuine noise spikes,\nbut most are actually caused by the effect of noise causing\nthe software to deblend single images into multiple compo-\nnents. The best way to account for all these effects is to cre-\nate full simulated CCD images, as described in paper III, for\neach evolutionary cosmological model of interest and run the\nimage detection and analysis software on these. The results\ncan then be compared with the real data. Ideally this would\nrequire a knowledge not only of how galaxies evolve in lumi-\nnosity and number, but also in morphology. In practice, such\ndetailed information is not available; however, much can be\ninferred by treating galaxies as ideal bulges and disks and\nwe have therefore re-created the two evolving B-band simu-\nlations described in paper III, with the appropriate parame-\nters for our 30hr WHT data (note that in order to simulate\nthe noise correctly the simulations include a contribution\nfrom sources fainter than the measurement threshold). Fig.\n7 displays the true and measured counts from the two mod-\nels, together with that from our real data, both raw and cor-\nrected for the detection rates in Table 3. Two points emerge\nfrom this. First, the corrections based simply on the detec-\ntion rates appear very close to those inferred from the full\nsimulations. To demonstrate this further we show in Fig. 7\nthe results of a simulation in which we have adjusted the\ntrue count to be very close to the real count as implied by\nthe detection rates. The measured count from this simu-\nlation is in reasonably good agreement with the raw data,\napart from the faintest points where the model falls off faster\nthan the data. We suspect this is a limitation of the models\nrather than an indication that the count slope suddenly rises\nagain. Second, the true counts appear to lie somewhere be-\ntween our two models. In particular, that model favoured in\nPaper III, with the steep luminosity function slope at high\nredshift, is now seen to overpredict the number of galaxies.\nThe corrections applied to the counts for the 30hr b-\nband frame are based on this simulation. For the other\nbands, i.e the co-added b-band frame, where with such a\nsmall area the corrections are particularly susceptible to the\nactual arrangement of images, and the u-, r- and i-band\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 9\nFigure 6. The results of adding simulated stars of known magnitude to the real WHT 30 hour b-band frame. Histograms of measured\nmagnitude are shown for 162 simulations of stars of each of five known magnitudes (indicated by the dashed vertical lines). Non-detections\nare placed in the faintest bin.\nframes which are not quite as deep, we appeal to the agree-\nment between the b-band detection rate corrections and\nthose from the full simulations and use the detection rate\ncorrections determined for each band (Table 3) to correct\nthe counts.\nNone of the above tests account for the problem of the\nhalos of bright images, which tend to be broken into many\nfaint images by isophotal detection algorithms. To some ex-\ntent the measurement of a local sky for the Kron magnitudes\nreduces this effect, but it still proved necessary to inspect all\nimages around the bright stars and galaxies in our frames by\neye and remove detections judged to be false. The effect this\nhas on the counts is small (always < 10%), but it is much\nmore important when attempting to measure the clustering\nof galaxies.\n4 THE HUBBLE DEEP FIELDS\n4.1 WFPC2 Data Reduction and Image Analysis\nThe HDF-N and HDF-S images were reduced in similar fash-\nion, except where noted.\nIn order to facilitate image detection, we rebinned\nthe images into 0.08\u2032\u2032 pixels and trimmed off (HDF-N) or\nblanked-out (HDF-S) the regions of lower signal-to-noise\naround the edge of the frames caused by the dithering tech-\nnique used in the observations. We then followed a similar\nprocedure to our WHT reductions. A 3-D polynomial of up\nto 3rd order was fitted to the sky background and subtracted\nfrom the data. An isophotal image detection algorithm was\nthen run over the data and a smoothed version of the data\nwith the detected images removed was subtracted from the\noriginal. The detection algorithm was then re-run on this\nflat-background frame. We used the zero-points issued with\nthe data-release as the initial basis for our photometry.\nNormally we would then use our isophotal detections\nas a basis for measuring total magnitude using our Kron-\nstyle algorithm. However, the HDF data, especially at the\nshorter wavelengths where for most galaxies we are looking\nfar into the rest-UV, suffers from the \u2018problem\u2019 that most\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n10 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nFigure 7. (a) Closed and open circles represent raw and corrected\n(on the basis of the simulated star results) galaxy counts from the\nWHT b-band data compared with true (solid line) and measured\n(dot-dashed lines) counts from the two simulations discussed in\nPaper III. (b) As for (a) but now showing our best fit simulation,\nwhere the true galaxy count has been adjusted to give a measured\ncount in agreement with the data.\nof the bright spiral and irregular galaxies are broken into\nnumerous bright knots, each detected as separate images by\nthe software. It was therefore necessary to re-assemble these\ngalaxies, and we chose to do this by visual inspection on the\nframes of all pairs of objects whose centres were closer than\n0.35\u2032\u2032. On average, this resulted in \u223c 100 re-assembled ob-\njects per frame, composed of an average of 4 sub-images, out\nof about 2500 detected objects. Inevitably it is ambiguous\nas to whether some images should be re-assembled or not -\nmany of them do not resemble \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies. In making\nour judgements we have borne in mind that an angular sep-\naration of 0.1\u2032\u2032 never exceeds a true separation of \u223c 400pc\nfor q0 = 0.5 and is unlikely to reach even twice this for low\nq0. It is difficult to conceive of images this close as separate\nentities.\nOnce the \u2018broken\u2019 images have been reassembled we\nrun our Kron magnitude software to determine total mag-\nnitudes. Tables 1 and 2 give details of the magnitude limits\nand isophotal and Kron parameters adopted for the HDF\nfields.With our choice of minimum radius (0.35\u2032\u2032) and mul-\ntiplying parameter (2.0) we should detect about 90% of\nthe light from resolved or unresolved objects. However, this\nchoice of minimum radius is not optimal for a star (for which\na 0.15\u2032\u2032 radius would result in a 0.5 magnitude improve-\nment in detection limit), but a compromise between signal-\nto-noise and the desire not to underestimate the magnitudes\nof faint, resolved galaxies. Many of these are likely to have\ntheir radii set to the minimum value just due to the noise in\ncalculating the Kron radius.\nAs the F300W frames are much less deep than the oth-\ners (due to the poor UV response of the WFPC2 CCDs) it\nwas decided to use the F450W image detections as input to\nthe Kron magnitude routine for these frames, rather than\nthose from the F300W image.\nFor an unresolved image, the total magnitudes which\ngive a 3\u03c3 detection inside our minimum radius of 0.35\u2032\u2032 are\ngiven in Table 1. We emphasise the point that these limits\nwill be brighter for resolved galaxies.\nAlthough the PC data is included in the HDF-S frames\n(and went through the reduction procedure), we exclude this\narea from our final sample due to the much lower signal-noise\non this chip. The final areas for the HDF-S and combined\nHDF-N data are listed in Table 1. These include a small loss\ncaused by images being too close to the edge of the fields to\nbe measured.\nDue to the vastly improved resolution and pixel scale\nthe HDF images do not suffer from confusion losses due to\ncrowding in the way the ground-based data does, and no\ncorrection has been applied. Incompleteness does occur at\nthe faintest magnitudes due to the offset and scatter between\nour isophotal and total magnitudes, and due to isophotal\neffects. These are discussed in Section 4.3.\nAs with the ground-based data we use fixed apertures\nto measure colours (section 3.3), but with a much smaller\nradius of 0.35\u2032\u2032. No relative \u2018seeing\u2019 correction is required. To\nmatch images we adopt a slightly different strategy to that\nfor the WHT data, in that we use the positions of the images\ndetected in one band as input to the Kron magnitude mea-\nsuring routine on the frames in the other bands (with the\none exception of the F300W band, where, as noted above,\nwe already use the F450W detections). The reason for this\nis that, due to the high resolution of the HDF and the irreg-\nular nature of many of the images, the positions of images\ndetected in one band may not coincide precisely with those\ndetected independently in another. One consequence of this\nis that we attempt a measurement of the colour for all the\nimages detected in a particular band, irrespective of whether\nthe corresponding object is below the detection limit in the\nother bands.\n4.2 WFPC2 Magnitude Systems\nTo compare the HST results with ground-based data it is\nnecessary to make some form of conversion from WFPC2\nmagnitudes (throughout this paper we zeropoint the HDF\ndata onto the vega system, defined so that an A0 star has\nzero colour) into the standard U,B,R&I bands. This can\nonly be done approximately, as none of the HDF filters are\nparticularly close to their more standard counterparts, and\nin general exact colour equations have not been measured.\nNote that for our cosmological models we always use the\ncorrect filters and do not rely on these transforms.\nAs a starting point we adopt the synthetic colour trans-\nforms of Holtzman et al. (1995), except for F814 where we\nuse their observed values. For F450W , F606W and F814W\n(we defer discussion of the F300W band until the end of\nthis section) the three Holtzman et al. (1995) equations we\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 11\nuse are\nB = F450vega + 0.23(B \u2212 V )\u2212 .003(B \u2212 V )\n2\nV = F606vega + .254(V \u2212 I) + .012(V \u2212 I)\n2\nI = F814vega \u2212 .062(V \u2212 I) + .025(V \u2212 I)\n2\nHowever, we really need these relations in terms of HDF\ncolour, not (B \u2212 V ) and (V \u2212 I), and to introduce a con-\nversion for the R band. The I : F814vega relation can be\ndeduced in terms of (F606 \u2212 F814)vega from the above\nequations, but to proceed further we use the following two\napproximate relations between the standard photoelectric\nbands which we have derived from the Landolt (1992) list\nof standard stars\n(V \u2212R) \u2248 0.58(B \u2212 V )\n(V \u2212 I) \u2248 1.95(V \u2212R)\nThese relations are accurate to no better than 0.05 mag, but\nthis is adequate for our purposes as this error gets multiplied\nby the colour coefficients, most of which are small. All five\nequations apply only for stars with (B\u2212V ) <\u223c 1.4 and (V \u2212\nI) <\u223c 2.0.\nCombining all the above (approximating second order\nterms), we can deduce\n(B \u2212 V ) \u2248 0.94(F450 \u2212 F606)vega\nand\n(V \u2212 I) \u2248 1.44(F606 \u2212 F814)vega\nand hence,\nB \u2248 F450vega + 0.22(F450 \u2212 F606)vega\nR \u2248 F606vega \u2212 0.37(F606 \u2212 F814)vega\nI \u2248 F814vega \u2212 0.07(F606 \u2212 F814)vega\nFor the median colour of the HDF galaxies (with F814vega <\n28) these approximate to\nB \u2248 F450vega + 0.1\nR \u2248 F606vega \u2212 0.1\nI \u2248 F814vega\nNote that the F450W colour equation is almost identi-\ncal to that used in Papers I, II and III for the photographic\nbj band. Hence\nbj \u2248 F450vega.\nThe F606W band is midway between the V and R pass-\nbands, and so has a large colour transform to either. Here\nwe have chosen to convert to R, as there are very few pub-\nlished V -band counts.\nThe F300W observations are more of a problem. This\nband is significantly shorter in wavelength than photoelec-\ntric U and the Holtzman et al. synthetic colour transforma-\ntion is large (varying by >\u223c 1 mag for \u22121 < (U\u2212B) < 1) and\nmay be multi-valued at (U \u2212B) \u223c 0.0. According to Holtz-\nman et al. there is also some question of the reliability of\nthe WFPC synthetic transforms for such short wavelength\nfilters. The best we can do in these circumstances is to take\nan approximate linear fit of the form\nU \u223c F300vega \u2212 0.75(U \u2212B)\nwhich reproduces the Holtzman et al. results to within \u223c 0.3\nmag for \u22121.5 < (U \u2212 B) < 1. Combined with our B-band\ntransformation this implies\nU \u223c F300vega \u2212 0.43(F300 \u2212 F450)vega +\n0.09(F450 \u2212 F606)vega\nFor galaxies with colours near the median of our distribu-\ntions this roughly translates to\nU \u223c F300vega + 0.4\nWe would hope that our B,R and I transforms are accu-\nrate to \u223c 0.1 mag, which is sufficient for the number-counts\nand colour distributions. Any comparison between HDF and\nground-based U can only be described as approximate.\n4.3 WFPC2 Completeness\nThe combination of ultra-high resolution but fairly unspec-\ntacular surface brightness limits can potentially lead to\nproblems in measuring resolved images. To counter this we\nemphasise that our adopted magnitude limits are quite con-\nservative. For unresolved images the highest signal-to-noise\nwould be achieved inside a radius of only 0.15\u2032\u2032. By choos-\ning a minimum radius of 0.35\u2032\u2032 we are sacrificing \u223c 0.5 mag\nin depth for such objects, in the hope of better measuring\nextended galaxies. Even so, the 3\u03c3 limit for a galaxy with a\nKron radius of 1\u2032\u2032 will be \u223c 1 mag brighter than that listed\nin Table 1. As an example, Fig. 8 shows the distribution of\nour measured Kron radii (containing \u223c 90 per cent of the\nlight) for the HDF-N F606W data. The solid line shows the\n3\u03c3 magnitude limit as a function of Kron radius. Although\nat the faintest magnitudes the majority of measured galax-\nies have Kron radii less than 0.6\u2032\u2032, there is a significant tail\nstretching out to \u223c 1\u2032\u2032.\nWe also have to consider the scatter between the isopho-\ntal magnitudes used in the detection routine (which were\nlimited as in Table 2) and the Kron magnitudes finally\nadopted. As a result of this the Kron magnitudes always\nhave a brighter completeness limit than the isophotal detec-\ntions.\nTaking these effects into account we consider the fol-\nlowing are reasonable completeness limits for our counts;\nF300vega \u223c 27; F450vega \u223c 28.5; F606vega \u223c 28.5;\nF814vega \u223c 27.5 (for HDF-N) and F300vega \u223c 26.5;\nF450vega \u223c 28.0; F606vega \u223c 28.0; F814vega \u223c 27.0 (for\nHDF-S). We analysed the HDF-S data to a slightly brighter\nmagnitude limit than the HDF-N due to the presence of ar-\neas of lower signal to noise at the joins between the three\nthree individual WFPC chips.\nAs a check, we have run the simulation used to correct\nthe WHT b-band data (section 3.6) with parameters appro-\npriate to the HDF-N F450W data. This suggests that for\nF450Wvega >\u223c 29 we start to lose significant numbers of disk\ndominated (i.e. low surface brightness) objects, but that at\nbrighter magnitudes the measured count is a good represen-\ntation of the true count. However, the size of images (which\nis dependent on cosmology) is a much more important factor\nin the HDF simulations than in those for the WHT, and it\nis not clear how accurate our simulations are in this respect;\nfor now we are confident that corrections to our magnitude\nscale or counts will not exceed 20%.\nWe have also run the detection\/analysis procedure on\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n12 N.

This enables\nus to look for spurious noise detections, which may add to\nthe count. We find less than a 5% contribution from such\nimages to the differential count at B \u223c 28, and nearly all\nthose which are found lie in the areas of reduced signal-to-\nnoise around the edge of the field. We therefore conclude\nthat such detections are not a significant problem.\n4.4 Comparison with other reductions\nThere are several other versions of galaxy counts based on\nthe HDF frames. Ferguson (1998) has presented a compari-\nson of our HDF-N data with that of Williams et al. (1996)\nand Lanzetta et al. (1996). Clear differences exist between\nthe datasets, all three of which used different photometry\npackages to analyse the HDF images.\nHere we compare in detail our HDF-N data with those\nof Williams et al. (1996), as they show the largest discrep-\nancy with ours. Fig. 9 shows an object by object magnitude\ncomparison between the two datasets for the F450W band,\nand a comparison of the resulting counts. It is clear that\nthere is a systematic magnitude offset and that our count\nslope is steeper than theirs, resulting in a difference of almost\na factor two in the surface density of objects at the faintest\nmagnitudes. Similar differences exist in the other 3 bands.\nFigure 9. (a) The difference between our magnitudes and\nWilliams et al. (1996) (on their AB system) for all objects de-\ntected by us on the HDF-N F450W frames. (b) A comparison of\nthe galaxy counts from the above frames - solid dots, this work,\nopen circles, Williams et al..\nAs pointed out by Ferguson (1998) there are two reasons\nfor this discrepancy. First, as noted above our magnitudes\nbecome systematically brighter as they become fainter. The\nexact offset is difficult to gauge as the magnitude difference\ndistribution has broad wings and becomes skewed, but, as an\nexample, the peak in (F606this paper\u2212F606Williams et al) \u223c\n0.05 at F606AB \u223c 25, \u223c 0.10 at F606AB \u223c 27 and \u223c 0.20\nat F606AB \u223c 28. The affect of this on the counts is actually\nquite small, generally < 10%. Second, we find objects which\nWilliams et al. apparently do not detect at all. This ap-\npears to account for the majority of the difference between\nthe datasets. A visual inspection of these images leads to\nthe conclusion that virtually all are merged into adjacent\nimages in the Williams et al. data. We suspect Williams\net al.\u2019s claim that merging is not a significant problem is\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

Of these 49\nare missing from their fully-merged sample (at any magni-\ntude), but 31 are still missing from their unmerged dataset.\nOf these, visual inspection reveals 25 are still merged with\nclose neighbours.\nAs at some level the definition of what is one galaxy\nsplit into two and what is two close galaxies is subjective,\nit is not possible to say who is \u2018right\u2019 and who is \u2018wrong\u2019.\nHowever, this ambiguity in the HDF counts should be borne\nin mind when comparing with theoretical models.\n4.5 HDF-S STIS Imaging Data\nThe Hubble Deep Field South STIS, unfiltered, 43hr image\nis to date the deepest image ever taken, being about \u223c 1\nmag deeper that the F606W images (although only cover-\ning \u223c 50\u2032\u2032\u00d7 50\u2032\u2032). The passband is effectively defined by the\nCCD and is \u223c 4000A\u02da wide (FWHM) centred on \u223c 6000A\u02da .\nWe have analysed the data in similar fashion to the WFPC2\nHDF images. Details of the parameters used are give in Ta-\nble 2. Areas around the central quasar and the bright star\non one edge of the frame were removed (and replaced by\nzero signal) before analysis, and the area of the frame was\nadjusted to take this into account. We adopted the AB zero\npoint of 26.39 given on the HDF-S WWW pages. As the\npassband is very different from conventional filters we make\nno attempt to convert these magnitudes into any other sys-\ntem.\n5 GALAXY COUNTS AND COLOURS\n5.1 U-band counts\nThere are very few U -band counts in the literature. Fig.\n10 shows the differential U -band galaxy count for those\nwe have been able to find, together with our WHT data\nfrom this paper (throughout, we assume galactic extinc-\ntion of EB\u2212V = 0.02 for the WHDF, as in Paper III).

The agreement between the ground-\nbased counts is good, apart from those of Songaila et al.\n(1990) which are somewhat low. These data were taken\nthrough a non-standard U -filter, and the offset to standard\nU we have used (from Hogg et al. 1997) must be rather\nuncertain. Overall there seems little change in the slope of\ndlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.4 from U \u223c 18 to U \u223c 25. Faintward of this\nthere is some indication that the counts are becoming shal-\nlower. We also show as an inset our HDF F300vega counts.\nThe approximate equivalent U -limit for the HDF data is\n27.5 mag. These appear to have quite a similar slope to the\nground-based data, although the F300W band is much fur-\nther into the ultra-violet than the ground-based U and the\nK-corrections for galaxies will be very different. In particu-\nlar, the Lyman-\u03b1 forest and the Lyman-limit start to dim\nthe flux reaching the F300W band at lower redshifts than\nfor the U band.\nTable 4 gives our WHT counts, whilst Table 5 lists our\nHDF counts as a function of F300vega.\n5.2 B-band counts\nFig. 11 shows a compilation of published B-band galaxy\ncounts over the range 15 <\u223c B <\u223c 29, including the corrected\ncounts from our new WHT data (for the whole WHDF and\nfor the co-added field) and the HDF F450W counts. All the\ncounts have been adjusted to be on the standard photoelec-\ntric B-band system. For our HDF counts the difference be-\ntween F450vega and B is 0.1 mag - section 4.2.

However, the slope is somewhat\nshallower that before, d logN\/dmb \u223c 0.25, which, if this\nreflects the slope of the faint end of the luminosity function\nTable 8.

(1997),\nbased on observations in good seeing on the Keck telescope.\nHowever, HDF data provide the major change, extending\nabout two magnitudes fainter than the ground-based data.\nTable 10.

However, the\nmean (F606\u2212 F814) colour for the HDF data is fairly con-\nstant faintward of R \u223c 24, suggesting that any change in\ncount slope between F606W and R is going to be mini-\nmal. The integral R counts reach \u223c 2\u00d7 106deg\u22122. We note\nthat the faint end slope is very similar to the B data, with\nd logN\/dmR \u223c 0.25. The count data are presented in Tables\n9 and 10.\nAlso shown inset in Fig. 12 are the HDF-S STIS counts.\nThese probe even deeper than the HDF F606 counts and ap-\npear to continue with a similar slope of \u223c 0.25. Note that\nthe apparent turn-over in the faintest bin is due to incom-\npleteness.\n5.4 I-band counts\nThis is the first time we have included an I-band count in\nthis series of papers. TheWHDF counts are detailed in Table\n11, whilst the HDF counts in F814vega are listed in Table\n12. From section 4.2 we see that F814vega \u223c I .\nThe counts are plotted in Fig. 13. Note that as well as\nour HDF counts and the WHT I-counts, we also show in\nthis diagram for the first time two sets of ground-based I-\nband CCD counts taken at prime focus of the Isaac Newton\ntelescope. The first set, to I \u223c 23, is based on 10 of the\nfields in Paper II (total area 6.3\u00d710\u22123 sq. deg.). These data\nconsisted of 4\u00d7 400s exposures on each field taken with an\nRCA CCD. The data reduction and analysis of these frames\nwere identical to those for the B and R frames in Paper II.\nThe second set are taken off a 1.5hr total exposure with a\nTek 1024\u00d71024 CCD (total area 2.4\u00d710\u22122 sq. deg.) centred\non the WHDF (see also section 3.2). These reach I \u223c 23.75.\nThe data reduction and analysis are similar to that described\nhere for the WHT data. Once again, all magnitudes have\nbeen adjusted to be on the standard ground-based system.\nThe ground-based counts have a slope of dlog(N)\/dm \u223c\n0.33 for 21 <\u223c I <\u223c 25, which appears to flatten slightly to\ndlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.27 for the fainter HDF data.\n5.5 Colours\nAs noted in sections 3.3 and 4.1 we use fixed aperture\ncolours. However, the difference in this aperture between\nthe WHT and HDF data (1.5\u2032\u2032 radius as opposed to 0.35\u2032\u2032)\ncertainly means that we are measuring colours (on average)\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

Fig. 23 shows the equivalent plots for the spaced-\nbased data, split into bright and faint magnitude ranges. We\ndiscuss these in more detail in the next section. Note, how-\never, that due to the different K-corrections between the\nHST and WHT passbands, especially in the ultra-violet,\nwhere the filters differ by \u223c 600A\u02da , the tracks of galaxies\nin these plots are not expected to be the same.\n6 GALAXY EVOLUTION MODELS\n6.1 Overview\nIn our previous work (Shanks 1990, Paper II, Paper III)\nwe have noted that if the B-band models are normalised at\nB \u223c 18 rather than B \u223c 15 then non-evolving models give a\nreasonable representation of the B counts and redshift dis-\ntributions in the range 18 <\u223c B <\u223c 22.5. Some support for this\nhigh normalisation comes from work on HST galaxy counts\nsubdivided by morphology, where non-evolving models with\nhigh normalisation give an excellent fit to both spiral and\nearly-type counts with 17 <\u223c I <\u223c 22 (Glazebrook et al. 1995,\nDriver et al. 1995). In Paper IV we have also shown that\nthese same non-evolving models fit the K-band counts as\nfaint as K \u223c 23. The B counts now have the work of Bertin\n& Dennefeld (1997) added at the bright end, comprising pho-\ntographic measurements over 145 deg2. Again these show a\nsteeper slope than the models at B < 17. The same au-\nthors\u2019 R counts show a similar effect at R < 16. In the I\nband the recent counts of Postman et al. (1998) also show\na steep slope at I < 17. Although these counts cover only\n16 deg2, they are made using a CCD. Finally, the 2MASS\ncounts (Cutri & Skrutskie 1998) which cover 158 deg2 to\nH = 15 and K = 14 are also found to be steeper than\nthe no evolution models (see McCracken et. al. in prepara-\ntion). This effect therefore seems to be present over a wide\nrange of passbands. If number count steepness were caused\nby evolutionary changes in star formation rate (SFR) at low\nredshifts, z <\u223c 0.1, then it would be surprising if the near-IR\ncounts were affected as much as the B counts. We therefore\ncontinue to believe that the most likely interpretation is that\nthis steepness at bright magnitudes is caused by large scale\ninhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution on \u223c 150h\u22121Mpc\nscales (Shanks et al. 1990, Paper III). Further evidence for\nthis has come from preliminary luminosity function data in\nthe 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey which shows a LF with the\nlocal M\u2217 and slope \u03b1 (Efstathiou et al. 1988, Loveday et al.\n1992, Ratcliffe et al. 1998), but a \u03c6\u2217 which is 50% higher\nthan the local value and in good agreement with the value\nthat is used here. We therefore believe that these develop-\nments justify our normalising the count models at B \u223c 18,\ncorresponding to an overall value of \u03c6\u2217 \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123. The\nexact normalisation (\u03c6\u2217) we use is given in Table 13 for the\nevolutionary models. In the case of no evolution we increase\nthese \u03c6\u2217\u2019s by 10% to give the same normalisation at B = 18\nas in the evolutionary models.\nMetcalfe et al. (1996) presented two evolutionary mod-\nels with this high normalisation which gave reasonable fits\nto the counts at all the wavelengths for which they had data,\nand to the HDF colours. These were a simple, q0 = 0.05 lu-\nminosity evolution model with exponentially decaying star\nformation rates, and a q0 = 0.5 model, similar but for the\naddition of a population of dwarf (hereafter \u2018dE\u2019) galaxies\nwith a constant star-formation rate until z \u223c 1 and zero\nthereafter.\nAs in Metcalfe et al. (1996), for simplicity we only con-\nsider two basic forms of evolution; a \u03c4=2.5Gyr exponentially\ndecaying star formation model for E\/S0 and Sab galaxies,\nand a \u03c4=9 Gyr model for Sbc\/Scd\/Sdm, both from Bruzual\n& Charlot (1993). This assumes that the evolution of the dif-\nferent morphological types is simply governed by their SFR\nhistory. For q0=0.05 and q0=0.5, the present day galaxy\nages are assumed to be 16Gyr and 12.7Gyr, implying for-\nmation redshifts of zf = 6.3 and zf = 9.9. We also consider\na model with a cosmological constant, zero spatial curvature\nand \u21260=0.3, with a present day age of 18 Gyr and a forma-\ntion redshift of zf = 7.9. Details of the present day lumi-\nnosity functions and colours used in our models are given in\nTable 13. All models take account of Lyman-\u03b1 forest\/break\nabsorption as described by Madau (1995). Similar models\nhave been used by Pozzetti et al. (1998).\nOne feature of these pure luminosity evolution (PLE)\nmodels is that they predict that z > 1 galaxies should be\ndetectable at reasonably bright magnitudes and this predic-\ntion has been broadly confirmed by B \u223c 24 redshift surveys\n(Cowie et al. 1995, 1996) undertaken on the Keck 10-m tele-\nscope. However, to provide a detailed fit to the B-band n(z)\ndistribution it is necessary to moderate the number of high z\nspiral galaxies predicted by the \u03c4=9 Gyr model by including\nthe effect of internal dust extinction, with A\u03bb \u221d 1\/\u03bb (Met-\ncalfe et al, 1996, cf.Campos & Shanks 1997 and refs. therein).\nWe have, at least initially, assumed that the extinction law\nand the star-formation history\/metallicity evolution can be\ntreated independently. Edmunds & Phillipps (1997) and Ed-\nmunds & Eales (1998) have investigated the effects of drop-\nping this assumption and indeed in Section 7 of this paper\nwe discuss possible evidence for evolution of the extinction\nlaw with redshift. A similar problem exists in the K-band\nn(z) with the \u03c4=2.5Gyr model for early-type galaxies. Here,\nessentially passive evolution overpredicts the high z tail at\nK \u223c 19. We have overcome this by adopting a dwarf domi-\nnated IMF, with a slope x = 3, for early-type galaxies (see\nPaper IV). In the optical bands this produces results very\nsimilar to the more widely used Salpeter or Scalo IMF\u2019s.\nThere is some evidence that passively evolving models over-\npredict the HST morphological counts of early-type galaxies\n(see e.g. Driver et. al. 1998 and references therein), but our\nmodel does a reasonable job of matching these counts, ex-\ncept at the faintest magnitudes, where morphological identi-\nfication becomes difficult. One problem for the x=3 model is\nthat it predicts an M\/LB \u223c120M\/L\u2299 for early-type galaxies\nas opposed to M\/LB=20 for x=1.35 and compared to the\nobserved value of M\/LB=10hM\/L\u2299. This disagreement in\nthe x=3 case is caused by the excess of low-mass stars. We\nhave therefore also considered a model still with \u03c4=2.5Gyr\nbut with an x=3 IMF which cuts off below 0.5M\u2299. The\nisochrone synthesis code for this case was specially supplied\nby G. Bruzual. This model then predicts M\/LB=5M\/L\u2299, in\nmuch better agreement with observation. The effect on the\ngalaxy colour predictions is reasonably small; for example,\nat 16Gyr the predicted rest (V \u2212K) colour is 3.27 for the\nx=3+0.5 M\u2299 cutoff case compared to (V \u2212K) = 3.67 in the\nx=3 uncut case and to (V \u2212K) = 3.25 in the Salpeter case.\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 19\nValues observed for giant ellipticals are in the range 3.1-3.5.\nVazdekis et al. (1997) have further shown that dwarf dom-\ninated IMF\u2019s with a low mass-cut, solar metallicities and a\n16Gyr age do produce consistent population synthesis model\nfits to nearby early-type galaxy spectra. Another problem\nfor a dwarf-dominated IMF is that it contains too few gi-\nant stars to generate the observed metallicity of present-day\nearly-type galaxies. However, this is also a problem for a\nSalpeter IMF, and a short initial burst with a much flatter\nIMF slope usually has to be invoked to solve this problem.\n(e.g Vazdekis et al. 1997). Indeed, Vazdekis et al. find that\ntheir chemical evolution, \u2018closed-box\u2019 model with a flat IMF\nduring an initial short burst and then a steeper IMF(x=2-\n3) plus low mass cut-off, produces an excellent fit to the\nspectra, and hence the observed metallicities, of local giant\nellipticals.\n6.2 Galaxy Count Models\nGalaxy counts generally constrain particular combinations\nof evolutionary models and cosmological parameters. Figs\n10 - 13 show how our various models fit to the counts in the\nfour bands. The HDF-S STIS count models (see Shanks et\nal. in prep.) are shown inset into Fig. 12. As well as the two\nevolving models described above, we also show their non-\nevolving counterparts, with the exception of the \u039b model\nwhich is very similar to the q0=0.05 no-evolution model.\nAlso shown is the q0 = 0.5 evolutionary model without the\nextra dE component and a new q0=0.5 evolutionary model\nwhich has a steeper luminosity function slope for Scd\/Sdm\ngalaxies (see below). As can be seen, even at the depths\nreached by STIS, our preferred evolutionary models fit the\ncounts reasonably well over a wide range of wavelengths.\nThis agreement continues into the infra-red (Paper IV).\nNote that both the evolution and no-evolution models in\nthe range 18<\u223c U <\u223c24 have different slopes when expressed\nin the ground-based U and HST F300W passbands, with\nthe slope in the F300W band being steeper. This is due\nto the HST band peaking at 3000A\u02da and the ground-based\nband peaking at 3800A\u02da .\nAs the counts move bluewards from I to B, the pat-\ntern is that the evolutionary excess of galaxies sets in at\nincreasingly lower space densities of galaxies, indicating the\nincreased sensitivity of the bluer bands to the increased SFR.\nHowever, at U the evolutionary excess appears smaller than\nat B; it also sets in no earlier in terms of galaxy number\ndensity. The reason is that the U band is unique in that it\nlies shortward of the 4000A\u02da break even at z = 0. Thus the\nK-corrections for late types are less than in B by about a\nmagnitude at z > 0.5 and indeed are negative for z > 1.\nThis means that the no-evolution U models are intrinsically\nsteeper than in B at U \u223c 24 and lie closer to the U data,\nwhich in fact has a similar slope to the B data. Thus less\nU evolution might, in principle, be thought to be needed.\nThe Bruzual & Charlot models, however, predict a similar\namount of evolution in U as in B, about 1 magnitude at\nz > 1. This leads to the U evolution models being slightly\nhigher than the data at U \u223c 24 whereas the B evolution\nmodels are slightly lower than the data. This results in a\nproblem for the models in fitting the detailed (U\u2212B) colours\nat B >\u223c 24, as we discuss further below with regard to the\nFigure 14. bccd-limited (b \u2212 r)ccd colour-magnitude histograms\nfor the WHDF data, split into four magnitude bins. The percent-\nages indicate the colour completeness for that magnitude range.\nThe predictions of the q0 = 0.05 (solid line) and q0 = 0.5 dwarf\n(dashed line) models are also shown.\nn(u\u2212b)ccd histograms in Fig. 16 and the (u\u2212b)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd\ndistribution in Fig. 20(b).\nThe q0=0.5 evolutionary model (without the added dE\ncomponent) fits the counts in the range 18 <\u223c B <\u223c 25\nwhereas the q0=0.05 and the similar k = 0, \u2126\u039b=0.7, \u21260=0.3\nmodels extend the fit to 18 <\u223c B <\u223c 27. It is well known that\nthe 4\u00d7 smaller volume available to z = 4 in the q0=0.5 case\nmakes it impossible to fit the faintest optical data with a\nPLE model (Yoshii & Takahara 1988, Guiderdoni & Rocca\nVolmerange 1990, Koo et al. 1993). Metcalfe et al. (1996)\ntherefore invoked the extra dE population at high redshift\nto improve the fit of this model. The parameters for this pop-\nulation are also given in Table 13. Essentially, these galax-\nies have a constant star-formation rate between zf = 9.9\nand z = 1 when the SFR cuts off. This causes the galaxies\nto dim dramatically in brightness, till they end up at the\npresent day with an M\u2217 some 5 magnitudes fainter than the\nnormal M*(z = 0) and with the colour of an E\/SO. This\nis in the spirit of a disappearing dwarf model (e.g. Babul\n& Rees 1992, Babul & Ferguson 1996, see also Phillipps &\nDriver 1995 for a discussion) built in the Bruzual & Char-\nlot \u2018single-burst\u2019 framework. Clearly it is not unique and if\nq0=0.5 then other models such as dynamical merging may\nalso produce the increased numbers of galaxies required at\nfaint magnitudes.\nA further q0=0.5 model that we consider explicitly here\nfor the first time is a model where we use a steeper faint end\nslope for the Scd and Sdm luminosity functions, \u03b1 = \u22121.75\nrather than \u03b1 = \u22121.5. Although this slope is steeper than\nseen in local luminosity functions, if the local under-density\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n20 N.

As Figure 14 but now for the HDF-N and HDF-S\nF450vega-limited (F450\u2212 F606)vega data.\nis real then it could be that the local luminosity function is\ndeficient in faint galaxies due to biasing. Then even cluster-\nfree luminosity function estimates may give misleading re-\nsults, assuming as they do that the luminosity function form\nis independent of galaxy environment. Alternatively, the late\ntype galaxy luminosity function may be assumed to evolve\nto steepen from \u03b1 = \u22121.5 to \u03b1 = \u22121.75 at z > 1. Possi-\nble evidence for such steepening at lower redshift has come\nfrom Lilly et al. (1995). Such a model gives a good fit to\nthe optical UBRI counts in Figs. 10 - 13. We also find that\nit is in reasonable agreement with the galaxy n(z) data at\nB < 22.5 and 22.5 < B < 24. McCracken et. al. (in prep.)\nfind that the H counts are only slightly over-predicted by\nsuch a model at H = 28. As they point out, the flat slope of\nthe H counts seems to disallow any such steepening of the\nluminosity function in the q0=0.05 cosmologies.\nFigure 16. bccd-limited (u\u2212 b)ccd colour-magnitude histograms\nfor the WHDF data.

In Figs. 16\n- 19 we show in the form of histograms the comparison be-\ntween our models and the data in both the HDF and WHDF.\nGenerally we regard the agreement in all bands as good,\nat least in terms of where the broad body of the galaxy\ncolours lie.

Recall\nthat the spiral types in our models are already assumed to\nhave dust absorption, AB = 0.3 mag at z = 0. If we added\nmore dust in the context of these models then we would have\ndifficulty in matching the extended n(z) in the Keck redshift\nsurveys at B < 24 (Metcalfe et al. 1996). We shall also ar-\ngue later that simply invoking dust extinction laws with a\n2200A\u02da dust feature as seen in the Galaxy is not supported\nby the (u \u2212 b)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd colour-colour data. The only\nother parameter which can potentially affect the UV colour\nof a star-forming galaxy is the IMF. We shall look further at\nwhat changes might improve the fit of the (u\u2212 b)ccd colours\nin Sect 6.4.\nMetcalfe et al. (1996), Madau et al. (1996) and Shanks\net al. (1998) all assumed on the basis of the Bruzual & Char-\nlot models that in the HDF (F300 \u2212 F450)vega > 0 corre-\nsponded to z >\u223c 2 galaxies. However, the above problem,\ntogether with the sensitivity of U \u2212B colours to both dust\nand Lyman absorption encourages us to use the extensive\nspectroscopic data in the HDF to check the reliability of our\nmodels. We shall see in Fig. 24(b) that (F300\u2212F450)vega=0\nclearly discriminates spectroscopic galaxy redshifts, above\nand below z = 2. Fig. 25 also shows that the HDF UV\ndropout galaxies accurately fall in their predicted place for\nz >\u223c 2 galaxies in the (F450\u2212F606)vega : (F606\u2212F814)vega\ndiagrams, which strongly suggests that z >\u223c 2 galaxies can\nbe discriminated from z < 2 galaxies on the basis of their\nground-based B\u2212R : R\u2212 I colours (see also fig. 4a of Met-\ncalfe et al. 1996). Thus it seems that, whatever the model\nuncertainties at z = 1, by z = 2 the effects of Lyman absorp-\ntion dominate, leaving the model (F300\u2212F450)vega colours\nroughly correct at z = 2. Metcalfe et al. then went on to de-\ntermine the fraction of HDF UV dropouts at 27 < B < 28\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n22 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nand found \u223c47\u00b17%, a fraction which compares well with\nthat predicted by the models. The results of calculating the\nz >\u223c 2 UV luminosity density with these criteria are discussed\nin Section 6.5 below (and by Shanks et al. 1998).\nIn the WHDF a simple (u\u2212 b)ccd cut is not adequate to\ndiscriminate high z galaxies, partly due to the difference in\npassbands, but mainly due to the brighter magnitude limit\nand hence lower average redshift of the sample. As a result\nit is necessary to apply a simultaneous cut in (b \u2212 r)ccd, in\norder to eliminate low z early type galaxies (especially for\nr-limited samples). In order to compare with previous work\nin the literature we take as a starting point UV dropout cri-\nteria which match those of Steidel et al. (1999) as closely\nas possible; these transform to a cut with approximately\n(u \u2212 b)ccd >1 (and \u22120.1 < (b \u2212 r)ccd < 1.6) in our mag-\nnitude system, and a limit of rccd <25.25. We also assign\n(u \u2212 b)ccd colours (which are really blue limits) to those\ngalaxies which were not detected in u by assuming their\nuccd magnitude to lie at the 3\u03c3 limit (uccd = 26.8). Given\nthe relative depths of our u-band data and Steidel et al.\u2019s,\nthis is roughly equivalent to the 1\u03c3 magnitude they adopted\nfor their non-detections. Many of these galaxies then fail\nthe selection criteria due to being too blue in (u \u2212 b)ccd.\nThe main purpose of this procedure is to remove faint, low-\nz early-type galaxies which might otherwise be mistaken for\nhigh-z dropouts. However it should be noted that it also\nloses potential high-z candidates in the process. We shall\nsee how some of these might be recovered in section 6.4.\nWith these criteria (and an eyeball check to exclude\nphotometry problems such as mergers) we detect 32 UV\ndropouts in 49 arcmin2, i.e. 0.65\u00b10.12 arcmin\u22122, to rccd <\n25.25 which is comparable to the 1.18\u00b10.04 arcmin\u22122 sky\ndensity for z \u223c 3 galaxies found by Steidel et al. (1999) at\nRAB < 25.5 (or rccd <25.25) and the upper limit of 3.3\u00b10.3\narcmin\u22122 for UV dropouts set by Guhathakurta et al. (1990)\nat a similar R-band limit. Applying the same blending cor-\nrections assumed by Steidel et al. (1999) for the brighter\ngalaxies would increase these three observed sky densities\nby a factor of 1.3.\n6.4 WHDF Colour-Colour Distributions\nWe first discuss the WHDF (r\u2212i)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd colour-colour\ndiagram. This is shown in Fig. 20(a). The data shows two\nunmistakable features. The first is the plume of red galaxies\nwhich moves redwards from (b\u2212r)ccd \u2248 1.6 to (b\u2212r)ccd \u2248 3\nat (r \u2212 i)ccd \u2248 0.7. The second is the \u2018hook\u2019 feature which\nlies below this red plume and contains the majority of the\ngalaxies. Interestingly, the models seem to show the same\ngeneric features, mostly due to the redshifting of the H\/K\nbreak through the passbands. The red plume is identified\nwith early type galaxies, with their decreasing UV spectrum\nshortward of the Ca II H\/K break moving through the b\nband and making the (b\u2212 r)ccd colour redder until z \u223c 0.5.\nAt 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 0.9 the H\/K feature moves through the r band\nmaking the (b \u2212 r)ccd colour more blue and the (r \u2212 i)ccd\ncolour more red. This shift of the (b \u2212 r)ccd colour to the\nblue is helped by the \u03c4=2.5 Gyr evolution whose effect on\nthe UV spectrum is increasingly felt in the b band at z >\u223c 0.5.\nThe hook feature is identified with spiral galaxies, with again\nthe H\/K break moving through the b band until z = 0.25\nwhen the increasing spiral UV spectrum is redshifted into\nthe b band. Then, helped by the H\/K break moving through\nthe r band at z >\u223c 0.5, (b\u2212 r)ccd continues to become bluer\nuntil the Lyman \u03b1 forest enters the b band at z \u223c 2.3. The\nH\/K break entering the r band at z \u223c 0.5 causes (r\u2212i)ccd to\nbecome redder before the same feature entering the i band\nat z > 0.8 causes (r \u2212 i)ccd to become bluer again.\nThe fact that the models show these features suggest\nthat they are broadly correct. Indeed the evolutionary mod-\nels show increased agreement with the data than simply us-\ning the K-corrections, especially in the case of the early-\ntypes beyond z \u223c 0.8. This is shown in Fig. 21 where we\ncompare the colour tracks from our evolutionary models to\nthe K-corrections calculated from our Bruzual models. In\nthe case of the spirals, the K-corrections provide a better\nfirst-order description of the colour-colour tracks than for\nthe early-types but evolution at low redshift and dust red-\ndening at high redshift also help; evolution makes the spi-\nrals slightly bluer than the K-corrections in (b \u2212 r)ccd and\n(r \u2212 i)ccd at z <\u223c 1 but then the K-corrections and evolu-\ntionary model colours become very similar in the 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 3\nrange. The effect of spiral dust actually makes the evolu-\ntionary model redder in (b \u2212 r)ccd at z >\u223c 1.5 and here it is\nthe effect of evolution and dust combined which improves\nthe fit of the Sbc model to the data.\nHowever, in detail there remain differences between the\nmodels and the (r\u2212 i)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd data. The most serious\nproblem in Fig. 20(a) is that the early-type galaxies appear\nto be too blue in (r \u2212 i)ccd at z >\u223c 0.5, indicating more flux\nshortwards of the H\/K break than predicted in the models.\nThis problem is a feature of all models tested including those\nwith a Salpeter IMF. Increasing \u03c4 helps by extending the\nperiod of active star-formation to lower redshifts but then\nthe (b \u2212 r)ccd colours tend to turn to the blue at z = 0.5\ntoo quickly in comparison with the data. It is possible that\nmodels with a less sharp H\/K break at high redshift may\nhelp because of decreased metallicity but so far we have not\ntested this hypothesis further.\nFig. 22 compares the predicted number density of galax-\nies at each point in the WHDF (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd\ncolour-colour diagram with the data. It can be seen that\nthe q0=0.05 and q0=0.5 dE evolutionary models both gen-\nerally give a good fit. In both cases the spirals are well fitted.\nAs in Fig. 20(a), the evolutionary models predict early-type\ncolours which are too red in (r\u2212 i)ccd for z > 0.5. It should\nbe noted that in the case of the early-types the q0=0.5+dE\nmodel appears to give more low redshift early types and\nthus better agreement with the data than the low q0 model.\nThese galaxies are estimated to lie at z \u223c 0.15 from their\ncolours and thus will have MB \u223c \u221216. These low luminosity\ngalaxies are therefore excellent candidates for a disappearing\ndwarf\u2019 population and spectroscopy is required to confirm\ntheir redshifts and investigate the nature of these galaxies.\nThe 32 UV dropout, rccd < 25.25, candidate 2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c\n3.5 galaxies based on the Steidel et al. (1999) selection crite-\nria discussed in the previous section have been circled in the\n(r\u2212i)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd plane in Fig. 20. However, it is clear that\nwe can use (r \u2212 i)ccd to refine further our candidate selec-\ntion, as some of the dropout galaxies have (r\u2212 i)ccd colours\nthat are too red for them to be at high redshift.

The locations of our initial sample of 32 high-z, UV-dropout galaxies based on the criteria of Steidel et al. (1999) are\nshown on both plots as circles and inverted triangles, the latter symbol indicating candidates which pass the Steidel et al. criteria but\nare too red in (r \u2212 i)ccd. The extra candidates which increase our final sample to 43 dropouts are shown as upright triangles (note that\nall the candidates are selected from an r-limited sample and so may not have corresponding data points or arrows on these plots).\nthe 3\u03c3 limit and subsequently failed Steidel et al.\u2019s selection\ncriteria (see section 6.3), we find that many of these have\n(r \u2212 i)ccd colours which indicate they are 2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5\ngalaxies ((r\u2212 i)ccd < 0.2). The net result is that our number\nof dropout candidates increases from 32 to 43, or 0.88\u00b10.13\narmcmin\u22122. It is this sample that we take forward to our dis-\ncussions in Sections 6.7 and 6.8. The q0=0.05 and 0.5 evolu-\ntionary models predict a sky density of 2.6-2.9 arcmin\u22122 for\n2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 galaxies at rccd <25.25. Thus the sky densities\npredicted by both models are in reasonable agreement with\nthe sky density of z \u223c 3 galaxies found in the WHDF and by\nSteidel et al. (see section 6.3), especially if we apply Steidel\net al.\u2019s bright-end 30% blending correction (which should be\nrelevant to both datasets). This suggests that Lyman break\ngalaxies may be interpreted as the high luminosity tail of\nnormal spiral galaxies as their SFR increases exponentially\nback towards their formation epoch. This conclusion applies\nboth in the q0=0.05 case where 99% of z >\u223c 3 galaxies are\nSbc\/Scd\/Sdm and even in the q0=0.5 \u2018disappearing dwarf\u2019\ndE case where 86% of the z >\u223c 3 galaxies are Sbc\/Scd\/Sdm\nand the remainder mostly E\/SO\/Sab with less than a 1%\ncontribution from dE.\nIt can also be seen from Fig. 20(a) that many other\ngalaxies appear in the same (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd location\nas our UV-dropout candidates but with no UV dropout.\nClearly there is the possibility that these are also z \u223c 3\ncandidates. Madau (1995) has used the incidence of Lyman\nlimit systems in QSO spectra to argue that almost all (\u223c\n80%) z >\u223c 3 galaxies should show UV dropout. This argu-\nment works well at z >\u223c 3.5, because there is a relatively\nlarge redshift range between 3 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 for a Lyman limit\nsystem to enter the U band. However, the empirical mean\nredshift of the UV dropout galaxies of Steidel et al. (1999)\nlies at z = 3.04\u00b10.24 and here the above argument reverses,\nbecause there is then only a very limited redshift range in\nwhich a Lyman limit system can intervene in the U band.\nThus at z \u223c 3 there is the possibility that 80% of galaxies\ndo not show UV dropout. Taking all the galaxies with simi-\nlar (r\u2212 i)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd colours to the UV dropout galaxies\ni.e. those with \u22120.1 < (b\u2212 r)ccd < 1.6 and (r \u2212 i)ccd < 0.2,\nwe find \u223c 220 new candidate z \u2248 3 galaxies. Spectroscopy\nof these candidates are required to determine how many of\nthem are actually at high redshift.\nThe WHDF (u\u2212 b)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd diagram in Fig. 20(b)\nshows the same two populations as in (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd\nalthough slightly less distinctively. The plume of early types\nlies at (b \u2212 r)ccd > 1.6 with the spirals now occupying a\nbroad strip below them. Again the E\/SO model seems to fit\nthe E\/SO plume to z \u223c 0.5 with the H\/K break exiting the b\nband at z \u223c 0.25 and then the evolved spectrum shortwards\nof 2500A\u02da entering the u band at z >\u223c 0.5 which takes the\n(u \u2212 b)ccd colour blueward until z \u223c 0.8, when, with both\nu and b on the steep but constant slope of the UV \u2018upturn\u2019\nspectrum, a constant (u\u2212 b)ccd = \u22120.4 colour is maintained\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n24 N.

The strong bluewards\nshift in (b \u2212 r)ccd between 0.7 <\u223c z <\u223c 1.5 is caused both\nby the H\/K break being redshifted through r and the UV\n\u2018upturn\u2019 spectrum at \u03bb < 2500A\u02da being redshifted through\nb. The spiral (u \u2212 b)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd tracks again first move\nbluer in (u \u2212 b)ccd and redder in (b \u2212 r)ccd due to H\/K\nmoving through the b band at 0 < z <\u223c 0.3. Then (b\u2212 r)ccd\nbecomes bluer at z >\u223c 0.5 when the decreasing spectrum\nshortwards of the H\/K break is redshifted through r until\nthe UV \u2018upturn\u2019 reaches r at z = 1.5.

(1999), as discussed in Section 6.3. The locations of our\nfinal sample of 43 u-band dropouts is indicated, with distinct\nsymbols indicating the original 32 satisfying the criteria of\nSteidel et al., and those lost and gained from invoking the\n(r \u2212 i)ccd selection. Note that, as the dropouts are chosen\nfrom an r-limited sample, not all have corresponding data\npoints on this b-limited plot. It can be seen that there is\ngood agreement with the location of z \u2248 3 galaxies implied\nby our models, for both early-types and spirals.\nAs shown by Fig. 21, in (u\u2212 b)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd the effects\nof evolution are again bigger for the early-type model than\nthe late-type model. At 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 1.8 the (b\u2212 r)ccd colours\nfor early-type evolution model become bluer than the K-\ncorrections and at 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 0.9 the (u\u2212b)ccd colours for this\nmodel also become bluer than the K-correction. However, for\nz > 0.9 in (u\u2212 b)ccd and z > 1.8 in (b\u2212 r)ccd the colours for\nthe evolution model are redder than the K-correction and\nthis trend is confirmed when intervening Lyman \u03b1 absorp-\ntion enters both u and b. For the spirals the K-corrections\nseem to give a similar result everywhere to the evolutionary\nmodel, evolution making the colours slightly bluer than the\nK-correction at low redshift and dust making the evolution-\nary model slightly redder at high redshift. We note that the\nK-corrections of Pence (1976) are similar to the Bruzual &\nCharlot K-corrections for z <\u223c 0.5 and, if anything, slightly\nbluer in (u\u2212 b)ccd at z >\u223c 0.5.\nThus in the redshift range 0.3 <\u223c z <\u223c 1 the predicted\n(u\u2212b)ccd colours for the spiral model are much bluer than is\nobserved; the spiral model reaches (u\u2212b)ccd = \u22121.0 whereas\nthe data only reach (u\u2212 b)ccd = \u22120.5. The discussion of the\nuccd and bccd photometry zeropoints in section 3.2 indicates\nthat errors in the colour zero-point of 0.1 mag or larger are\nunlikely. In any case we shall see below that the same effect\nis also seen in the independent HDF data. This discrepancy\nis surprising since the UV spectra of star-forming galaxies\nare only governed by two parameters, dust absorption and,\nmore weakly, the IMF. We postpone to Section 7 further\ndiscussion of possible explanations of this result.\n6.5 HDF Colour-Colour Distributions\nAn HDF-N colour-colour comparison with similar models\nhas previously been briefly discussed by Metcalfe et al.\n(1996). We now add in the HDF-S data and look at the\ncombined (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega and\n(F300 \u2212 F450)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega diagrams at both\na bright and a faint limit in Figs. 23. The most promi-\nnent feature remains the line of galaxies moving redward\nin (F300 \u2212 F450)vega while remaining blue in (F450 \u2212\nF606)vega. These are the UV dropouts galaxies expected\nto be at z >\u223c 2 as discussed above. In general, the tracks\nappear broadly consistent with the models and as such\nprovide strong support for the approach used here. The\n(F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega tracks again seem\ngood fits; the Sbc track in particular gives an excellent\nfit to many of the bluer galaxies, although when shifted\nto the rest colours of Scd and Sdm\u2019s gives slightly too\nblue a colour in (F450 \u2212 F606)vega. In the bright data the\nplume of early-type galaxies is not seen as clearly as in the\nWHDF in either (F300 \u2212 F450)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega\nor (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega but the models\nagain give a reasonable representation of the redder galaxies.\nAgain, as for the WHDF (u\u2212 b)ccd, the Sbc model predicts\ntoo blue (F300\u2212 F450)vega colours for spirals at z = 1 and\nthe arbitrary shifting of the Sbc curve to the rest colours of\nScd and Sdm galaxies leaves their tracks not fitting well in\nthis redshift range either. At fainter limits, it can be seen\nthat galaxies predicted to lie at z \u223c 2 dominate the data.\nNext, in Fig. 24(a),(b) we plot the HDF-N and HDF-\nS galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts on the (F300 \u2212\nF450)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega and (F606 \u2212 F814)vega :\n(F450 \u2212 F606)vega diagrams. The points are colour-coded\naccording to the galaxy redshift range and the model tracks\nare similarly colour-coded. It can be seen there is good gen-\neral agreement between the predicted and observed redshift\nranges, again firmly supporting the idea that these simple\nmodels do an excellent job of describing the colours of faint\ngalaxies.\nFig. 25 shows how the HDF UV dropouts populate\nthe correct part of the HDF (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212\nF606)vega diagram for z >\u223c 2 galaxies. Again this indicates\nthat ground-based (r \u2212 i) : (b \u2212 r) colour-colour combina-\ntions may be effectively used to discriminate z >\u223c 2 galaxies\nwithout the need of a UV band.\nFig. 26 compares the predicted number density of galax-\nies at each point in the (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212\nF606)vega colour-colour diagrams with the data at F606 <\n28. It can be seen that the q0=0.05 and q0=0.5 dE evolu-\ntionary models both give a good fit with the density peak-\ning in both the models and the data at the colours of z \u223c 2\nspirals. The fact that the spiral models fit so well through-\nout the range 0 < z <\u223c 3 is again a strong argument that\nthe evolutionary history of the SFR is well described by\nthe \u03c4=9Gyr exponentially increasing SFR used here. The\nearly-type galaxies are not so clearly seen in this HDF data\ncompared to the equivalent WHDF data shown in Fig. 22.\n6.6 Sizes\nIt has been claimed that the angular sizes of faint HDF\ngalaxies are small compared to local galaxies (Roche et al.\n1998 and references therein), suggesting there has been size\nas well as luminosity evolution. We have examined this ques-\ntion in the light of our simple evolutionary models by adapt-\ning the simulation procedures used to replicate the WHT\ndata in section 3.6 to produce mock HDF frames based on\nour models. We are then able to apply our data-analysis\nprocedures to these frames and compare the angular sizes\nmeasured for the artificial galaxies with the real HDF data.\nAs before (see Paper III), we assume the Freeman (1970)\nlaw to relate exponential disk size to absolute magnitude\nand the diameter-magnitude relations of Sandage & Perele-\nmuter (1990) for r1\/4 bulges. Fig. 27 shows the results for\nour q0 = 0.05 model. The solid line represents the mean\nisophotal radius (at \u00b5F450 = 28.5) of our artificial galaxies,\nwhilst the dots show the same quantity for the F450-band\nHDF-N data. Although small differences exist, the agree-\nment between model and data is remarkably good. It should\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n26 N.

The evolutionary tracks predicted from our Bruzual & Charlot\nmodels are shown out to z = 4 for the five galaxy types. Filled squares show z = 0, open squares with numerals indicate 0.5z steps.\nbe noted that the apparent isophotal angular radii for the\nfaintest galaxies (\u223c 0.2\u2032\u2032) correspond to metric radii of only\n\u223c 2 kpc (H0 = 50 kms\n\u22121Mpc\u22121). This is much smaller\nthan local L\u2217 galaxies, but demonstrates both the effect of\nisophotal dimming and the fact that, at F450vega \u223c 29, in\nthe models we are looking down the luminosity function to\ngalaxies with low intrinsic luminosities and small sizes.\nWe find similar results for the q0 = 0.5 dE model, if\nwe assume the \u201cdisappearing dwarf\u201d population follows the\nsame Sandage & Perelemuter law as local bulge dominated\ngalaxies.\n6.7 Star Formation History\nOur evolutionary models imply that the SFR density rises to\nbeyond z = 2, according to the \u03c4=9Gyr Bruzual & Charlot\nmodel. This is at odds with the conclusions of Madau et\nal. (1996) who used UV fluxes as an estimate of the SFR\nand, on the basis of the same HDF-N data, concluded that\nthe SFR peaks at z \u223c 1 and decreases rapidly thereafter.\nFollowing Shanks et al. (1998) we first discuss the reasons\nfor the differences seen between our SFR history and the\noriginal SFR estimates of Madau et al. (1996).\nThe approach of Madau et al. (1996), following Cowie et\nal. (1988) and Lilly et al.(1995,1996), uses the fact that the\ngalaxy UV flux density is proportional to the SFR density to\nobtain estimates of the SFR history of the Universe. They\nuse the CFRS spiral evolving LF of Lilly et al. (1995) to\ndetermine the 2800A\u02da flux density in the range 0 < z <\u223c 1\nand the HDF F300W and F450W dropouts to obtain the\n1620A\u02da flux density in the ranges 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 and 3.5 <\u223c\nz <\u223c 4.5. Their conclusion of a peak in the SFR at z \u2248 1 is\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 27\nFigure 24.

The location of (F300 \u2212 F450)vega drop-out galaxies in the HDF (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega plane. Circled\ndots indicate galaxies with no measured (F300 \u2212 F450)vega. By comparing with Fig. 24(a) it can be seen that these drop-out galaxies\nhave colours very close to those predicted by the models for galaxies with z > 2 in this colour plane.\nther supporting evidence comes from the B < 19.5 mag 2dF\ngalaxy redshift survey results of e.g. Colless (1999) where the\nluminosity function at low z appears to move in the density\nrather than the luminosity direction, as would be expected\non the basis of the large-scale structure hypothesis.\nIn considering possible reasons first for the differences in\nthe 0.2 <\u223c z <\u223c 1 range, fig. 5 of Shanks et al. showed that our\nexponential models reasonably fit the rest B-band luminos-\nity functions determined from the CFRS data. However, the\nworst fit of our evolving luminosity function to the CFRS\ndata was in the 0.2 < z < 0.5 spiral bin and this proba-\nbly accounts for most of the discrepancy between our model\nSFR density and the CFRS data in this range. Further un-\ncertainty is introduced because the 2800A\u02da flux density in\nthis bin has to be extrapolated from the observed B-band\ndata (Lilly et al. 1996). Other measures of the SFR from the\nOII measurements of Tresse & Maddox (1998) and Treyer et\nal. (1998) at z\u223c0.2 agree much better with our exponential\nmodel at low redshift.\nIn the 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 range, the reasons that the SFR\ndensity estimate of Madau et al. lies a factor of \u22483 below\nour model in fig. 4 of Shanks et. al. (1998) are also clear.\nFirst, if we repeat the Madau et al. measurement in the\nHDF-N, then we obtain a factor of 1.56\u00d7 bigger luminosity\ndensity at 1620A\u02da for z >\u223c 2 UV drop-out galaxies than these\nauthors, mostly due to the fact that we measure brighter\nmagnitudes for individual galaxies (see Fig. 9). Second, if\nMadau et al. were to include our AB(z=0) = 0.3 mag dust\nabsorption for spirals, then this would effectively increase\ntheir 1620A\u02da luminosity density by another factor of 2.12.\nCombined, these two effects give a factor of 3.3\u00d7 overall\nwhich explains the above discrepancy of approximately a\nfactor of 3. In the 3.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.5 bin the same two effects\napply. However, the discrepancy here with our model is so\nlarge that we shall suggest below that they may in fact be\nin genuine disagreement.\nIn Fig. 28(a,b) we illustrate some of these points by\ncomparing various observational estimates of the SFR den-\nsity with our evolutionary models for both the q0=0.05\n(\u03c4=9Gyr, tgalaxy=16Gyr, h50 = 1) and the q0=0.5+dE\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

In (a) the dis-\ncontinuity arises from the contribution of the \u2018disappearing\ndwarfs with their constant SFR at z>1. The z = 0 normali-\nsation used in both cases was obtained by first estimating the\nlocal luminosity density in the F300W passband from the\nSbc\/Scd\/Sdm Schechter parameters in Table 13. This gave\n\u03c13000A = 9.8\u00d7 10\n25h\u22123\n50\nerg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 Mpc\u22123. We then con-\nverted to SFR density using the factors given by Madau et\nal. (1996) (corrected downwards by a factor of 1.25 according\nto the extrapolation to 3000A\u02da from 1500-2800A\u02da and then\ndownwards again by the factor 1.6 for the reasons suggested\nby Connolly et al. 1997) to obtain \u03c1\u2217 = 0.00735M\u2299h\n\u22123\n50\nyr\u22121\nMpc\u22123. Finally we corrected this SFR(z) normalisation for\nour inclusion of AB = 0.3 mag dust absorption. Assuming\nour 1\/\u03bb dust model this amounts to an upwards correction\nby a factor of 1.54.\nAll observational points based on \u03c12800A are first cor-\nrected downwards by the factor of 1.6 recommended by\nConnolly et al (1997). They are then corrected using the\nAB = 0.3 mag dust absorption as used in our model. Fur-\nther, we have LF corrected each point either by taking the\npublished correction or, where these are absent, as in the\ncase of the HDF-N data of Madau et al. (1996), by run-\nning the q0=0.05\/ q0=0.5+dE evolutionary models in each\nredshift range and integrating the galaxy luminosity density\nto convergence. We also apply these LF corrections to our\nown data. Thus if our model and the data are fully consis-\ntent, then they should agree in this Figure. As well as the\npoints of Gallego et al. and the CFRS points of Lilly et al.\n(1996) (both dust\/LF corrected), we have also plotted the\ndust\/LF corrected HDF-N points of Connolly et al. (1997)\nin the 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 2 range.\nAlso shown in Fig. 28 are our new WHDF estimates\nof the SFR density at 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 2. These were obtained\nby integrating the luminosity density of galaxies with (b \u2212\nr)ccd < 0.6 and (r \u2212 i)ccd > 0.4 which are approximately\nwhere the 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 2 galaxies lie in Fig. 20. The 343 galaxies\nwith bccd < 26 and the 267 galaxies with rccd < 25.5 give\nthe values for the UV luminosity density and SFR densities\nshown in Table 14; these are somewhat lower than given by\nConnolly et al. particularly in the q0=0.05 case. However,\nthe colour cuts we have used are relatively crude and this\nmay be responsible for any difference with the HDF results\nand our own data.\nIn the redshift range 2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5, Fig. 28 shows\nthe HDF-N UV dropout data of Madau et al. (1996), cor-\nrected for our AB = 0.3 mag dust absorption and our\nLF incompleteness corrections. Also shown is the Keck\nUV dropout galaxy data of Steidel et al. (1999), with our\ndust (AB = 0.3 mag with 1\/\u03bb giving A1500 = 0.9 mag)\nand LF incompleteness corrections. With their own dust\n(E(B \u2212 V )Calzetti=0.15 giving A1500 = 1.7 mag) and LF\nincompleteness corrections, Steidel et al. (1999) find their\nz = 3 SFR is a factor of 3.4 higher than shown in Fig. 28\n(a). Fig. 28 also gives new estimates of the SFR density at\n2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 from WHDF u-band dropouts to rccd <25.25\ntogether with the estimates from the data of Steidel et al.\n(1999). Here we have taken the 43 UV dropout candidates\nwe identified in Section 6.4 to give the value of \u03c11500 shown\nin Table 14. Again using the conversion factors stated in the\npaper of Madau et al. this gives the SFR densities shown\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n30 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nFigure 27.

The dust\/LF corrected estimate is plotted in\nFig. 28. We have corrected our WHDF data upwards by\na factor of 2.38 in the case of q0 = 0.5, 3.15 in the case\nof q0 = 0.05, to use the effective volumes (including their\ncolour incompleteness\/deblending correction) of Steidel et\nal. (1999). The observed WHDF SFR density estimate is\nclose to the observed value from Steidel et al. (1999), when\nour corrections are consistently used. We similarly have plot-\nted our estimates of the SFR at 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 from the HDF-\nN and HDF-S UV dropouts using the same criteria as used\nby Madau et al. (1996). All HDF SFR\u2019s at z = 2.75 have\nbeen corrected upwards by a factor of 1.19 to account for\ncolour incompleteness\/blending as estimated by Steidel et\nal (1999).

Again the points shown assume our dust and LF\ncorrections. Using their own LF and dust absorptions would\nresult in a factor of 1.7 increase in the SFR at z = 4 over the\nvalue shown in Fig. 28 (a). Although Steidel et al. include\n1.7 magnitudes of dust absorption at 1500A\u02da as opposed\nto our 0.9 magnitudes, their use of the effectively gray ex-\ntinction law of Calzetti (1997) means that they include 1.2\nmagnitudes of dust at 2800A\u02da compared to our 0.5 magni-\ntudes, so the effect of their higher dust absorption is mainly\non the normalisation of the SFR:z plot rather than its form\n(compare their fig. 9 to Fig. 28 (a)). In Fig. 28(a),(b) the\nWHDF points are close to both models at z = 4 but the Stei-\ndel et al. point is higher than the q0=0.05 model at z = 4\ndue to a large LF correction. However, in all cases the HDF\npoints at z = 4 are lower, even though we have applied both\nthe dust and LF incompleteness corrections consistently. We\nshall return to discuss this discrepancy between the HST and\nground-based SFR estimates at z = 4 in Section 6.8.\nWe conclude that, within the various errors and cor-\nrection factors, there is reasonable self-consistency with the\nfully corrected SFR density data and our model assuming an\nexponentially increasing SFR with look-back time, at least\nto z \u223c 3. At 3.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.5, the ground-based data of Steidel\net al. and ourselves is generally in much better agreement\nwith our exponential model than the HDF data. Steidel et\nal. (1999) have suggested that this may be because the HDF-\nN is too small to be representative. However, we note that\nthe B dropout data from the HDF-S show good agreement\nwith the HDF-N SFR density. Therefore the picture at high\nredshift based on the integrated measure of UV luminosity\nand SFR density remains unclear. We note that because of\nthe large size of the LF incompleteness and dust corrections,\neven where our model and the SFR density data agree, this\nonly really checks the internal consistency of our model and\nthe SFR data. In Sect. 6.8 we shall make a more direct test\nof our models than afforded by Fig. 28.\nProbes of the SFR at high z using SCUBA sub-\nmillimetre observations (Smail et al. 1997, Hughes et al.\n1998, Barger et al. 1998) have also suggested that dust may\nre-radiate absorbed UV luminosity and thus provide an ex-\nplanation for the sub-mm counts. Busswell & Shanks (2000)\nhave shown that dust re-radiated UV flux in our evolving\nspirals, even though the B-band absorption is as low as\n0.3 magnitudes, can also make a significant contribution to\nthe steep sub-mm counts. Thus our spiral evolution models\nwhich include dust may be enough in themselves to explain\nthe sub-mm counts, at least at faint, \u223c 1mJy fluxes.\n6.8 Counts of UV and B dropout galaxies and the\nepoch of galaxy formation\nIn order to clarify the status of our model predictions at\n2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.5 we now consider Figures 29 and 30 where we\nhave plotted the number-magnitude counts of UV dropout\n(as defined in section 6.4) and B dropout (see section 6.7)\ngalaxies and compared them to our model predictions. The\ncount predictions for the q0=0.05, q0=0.5(+dE) and \u039b evo-\nlutionary models are shown and their shapes are similar to\nthe galaxy luminosity functions at high redshift. The up-\nturn at M\u2217 in the q0=0.5 case is due to the extra contri-\nbution from the disappearing dwarf population at high red-\nTable 15.

Taking Fig. 29(a) first, which applies to the counts of\nground-based UV dropouts in the redshift range 2.5 <\u223c z <\u223c\n3.5, plotted as a function of rccd magnitude, we see that,\nalthough the new WHDF count (Table 15) is slightly lower\nthan the Keck data from Steidel et al. (1999), overall the\ndata agree well with the model predictions at bright mag-\nnitudes. Similarly, in Fig. 29(b), the HDF-N UV dropout\ndata from Madau et al. (1996) and our own HDF-N and\nHDF-S analyses in the 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 range agree well with\nthe models at fainter F606vega magnitudes. In Fig. 29 we\nhave adopted the average colour incompleteness\/blending\nfactors suggested by Steidel et al. (1999) which means that\nboth the Steidel et al. and the WHDF number counts are\nincreased by a factor of 1.3. We conclude that the luminosity\nfunction of galaxies in the redshift range 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 ap-\npears reasonably consistent with the local galaxy luminosity\nfunction of Sbc\/Scd\/Sdm galaxies (which dominate at high\nredshifts), as modified by the effects of \u03c4=9Gyr evolution\nplus dust. In the particular case of the q0=0.5 model, the\ndata seem more consistent with a model which includes the\ndE population rather than the same model without the dE\npopulation (also shown in Fig. 29). Thus there is strong ev-\nidence that the space density of galaxies at low redshift and\nz \u223c 3 may be very similar, whatever the underlying model,\nand this may be a stronger conclusion than any drawn from\nFig. 28 above which frequently have to rely on large LF in-\ncompleteness corrections at high redshift to compare SFR\ndensities with low redshift measurements. Fig. 29 suggests\nthat not only may the galaxy luminosity density be constant\nin the range 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 3 but the space density and luminosity\nfunction of galaxies may also be reasonably unchanging in\nthis redshift range. It also suggests that the Lyman-break\ngalaxies detected by Steidel et al. may be interpreted as the\nevolved bright tail of the local Sbc\/Scd\/Sdm galaxy lumi-\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n32 N.

At z \u223c 4, the data\nseem more similar to the fourth model shown, which is the\nq0=0.5 model without the extra dE population. Thus the\noverall conclusion seems to be that at z \u2248 4 the observed\ngalaxy luminosity function appears to drop significantly be-\nlow our basic models at absolute magnitudes fainter than\nM\u2217.\nOne interpretation would be that the assumption of a\nconstant space density of galaxies in our models had failed\nby z \u223c 4 and that we were possibly detecting the epoch\nof galaxy formation. It might also be suggested in the con-\ntext of the q0=0.5 model that the results might imply that\nthe bright galaxies were in place even as early as z \u2248 4\nand the dE population appeared between 3 <\u223c z <\u223c 4 and\nthen dimmed to become the dwarf galaxy population possi-\nbly detected at b < 25 in the WHDF (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd\ncolour-colour diagram. This may be similar to the \u2018downsiz-\ning\u2019 scenario claimed by other observers at lower redshifts\n(e.g. Cowie et al. 1996).\n7 DISCUSSION OF MODEL SUCCESSES AND\nFAILURES.\nOur basic conclusion is that the galaxy counts in the optical\nbands can be well fit by simple Bruzual & Charlot models\nwith an exponentially increasing rate of star-formation to\nz \u223c 3. In the low q0 case, this type of model can fit the data\nto B \u223c 27 whereas in the high q0 case the model only fits to\nB \u223c 25, just beyond the current limit for galaxy redshift sur-\nveys. In this case a model with either a disappearing dwarf\ndE population or an increased luminosity function slope at\nhigh redshifts must be invoked to increase the counts at faint\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V.

These data are compared to our evolutionary model\npredictions with q0=0.05, 0.5 and \u2126\u039b=0.7. In the q0=0.5 case the\ncontribution of the dE population can be seen at iccd > 25 and\nthe prediction for the q0=0.5 model without the dE population\nis also shown. The observed faint galaxy LF appears to fall below\nour model predictions by a factor of \u22485, indicating that while\nbright L\u2217 galaxies may have been in place at z \u22484, the faint\ngalaxy population may have formed between z \u2248 3 and z \u2248 4.\nmagnitudes. We have also shown that the models produce\na magnitude-size relation, which for either value of q0, is\nconsistent with the data.\nWe have also presented new results from the WHDF\nand the HDF-N and HDF-S for the SFR density of galaxies\nover the redshift range 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 and the results from this\napproach are broadly consistent with both previous data and\nthe above results if effects such as internal dust absorption\nin spirals are included in the models. However, other system-\natic effects may still dominate this route to the SFR history.\nAlso, with this approach the poor fit to the faint counts of\nthe q0=0.5 model using the local galaxy luminosity function\nwould be missed.\nAt high redshifts, the number of galaxies predicted by\nthe simple models at z \u2248 3 agrees well with the number\nof UV dropout galaxies detected at R \u223c 25 by ourselves\nand by Steidel et al. (1999). Thus the PLE models seem to\ncontinue to fit the data as far as z\u22483. However, at z \u2248 4, the\nPLE models start to overpredict the faintest data and this\nmay suggest that dwarf galaxies may have formed at z \u2248 4.\nWe regard the agreement between the spiral models and\nthe bright, Lyman break galaxy data as another indication\nthat the spiral model is broadly correct in the range 1 <\u223c\nz <\u223c 3 and therefore that the star-formation rate follows our\nexponential model throughout this redshift range.\nWe have seen that the agreement between these models\nand the WHDF and HDF galaxy colours is particularly good\nin (R\u2212 I) : (B\u2212R), where two faint galaxy populations are\nclearly seen corresponding to early- and late-type galaxies.\nThe features seen in the data match those predicted by the\nmodels so well that this forms a strong argument that these\nmodels must be a reasonably accurate description of the\nevolving spectra of faint galaxies. Even in (U \u2212B) : (B\u2212R)\nthey at least provide a good qualitative description of the\ndata.\nThe outstanding issue for the early-type galaxy models\nis the need to use a dwarf-dominated IMF (with a 0.5M\u2299\ncut-off) for early-types in order to reduce the number of z >\n1 galaxies predicted in K < 19 redshift surveys. The effect\nof using this IMF on the predicted optical colours is small.\nA slightly more extended initial period of star-formation is\nrequired with our dwarf dominated IMF(\u03c4=2.5Gyr) than\nwith Salpeter (\u03c4=1Gyr) to match the move towards bluer\n(B \u2212 R) colours at z \u223c 0.5 seen in the (R \u2212 I) : (B \u2212 R)\ndiagram. However, we note that the Salpeter\/\u03c4=1Gyr model\nwould then also overpredict the numbers of z > 1 galaxies\ndetected in optical (B < 24) redshift surveys too. Thus, over\na wide range of wavelengths, the case against the Salpeter\nplus \u03c4=1Gyr model for early-types from the redshift surveys\nis strong. The alternative solution to the dwarf-dominated\nIMF is a merging model as considered by other authors (e.g.\nKauffmann & Charlot 1998). It remains to be seen whether\nthe merging model will produce as good a fit to the (R\u2212I) :\n(B \u2212R) data as the simple PLE model discussed here.\nFor the spiral model, the outstanding issue is that in\nthe redshift range 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 1 the predicted (u \u2212 b)ccd\ncolours are up to 0.5 magnitudes too blue compared to\nthe data. Since the u and b bands peak close together at\n3800A\u02da and 4400A\u02da this implies quite a sizeable discrep-\nancy in the redshifted spectral slope between 1500-2500A\u02da ,\nwhere the Bruzual and Charlot model predicts approxi-\nmately f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\n\u22122.5 and the data would prefer f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\n0.5.\n(u\u2212 b)ccd is more affected than (b\u2212 r)ccd because the small\nwidth of the u band means there is less smoothing and\nbecause the wide wavelength separation of b and r means\nthat they simultaneously lie in the range 1500-2500A\u02da for a\nshorter redshift span (at z \u223c 1.7). The (u\u2212b)ccd discrepancy\nis puzzling because the UV colours of star-forming galaxies\nare governed by only two parameters, dust and the IMF. We\nalready have AB = 0.3 mag dust in the model and because\nthe reddening vector runs parallel to the (u\u2212b)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd\ntrack at z = 1, it would take a significant increase in the\namount of spiral dust to improve the fit and this would spoil\nthe n(b) and n(z) fits even at bccd \u223c 25.\nWe have experimented with including the Galactic\n2200A\u02da dust absorption feature but although this tends to\nhelp while it moves through u, it then moves through b mak-\ning (u \u2212 b)ccd sharply redder and this tends to make the\nagreement with the data even worse at z >\u223c 0.7. We also\ntried using an x=3 IMF as for the early-types with \u03c4=9Gyr\nto redden the (u \u2212 b)ccd colours but although this helped\nredden (u \u2212 b)ccd in the 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 1 range, (b \u2212 r)ccd also\nbecame too red for any agreement with the data even at\nlow redshift. We conclude that the original parameters of\nAB = 0.3 mag, 1\/\u03bb, dust absorption and a Salpeter IMF re-\nmains closer to the (u\u2212 b)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd data than these al-\nternatives. The fact that the K-corrections seem to demand\na steep UV slope for galaxies locally might be thought to\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n34 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nindicate an explanation for the (u\u2212b)ccd problem where the\nIMF might evolve with redshift. However, the UV spectra\nof local spirals has much scatter and it has long been known\nthat only the bluest local galaxies (e.g. NGC4449) give spec-\ntra as steep as predicted by the Bruzual & Charlot models\nwith an IMF that is a single power-law.\nG. Bruzual has suggested (priv. comm) that an upper\nmass cut-off of 5-6 M\u2299 in the spiral IMF rather than the 125\nM\u2299 which we conventionally use will flatten the spiral s.e.d.\nshortwards of 2000A\u02da and help take the colours closer to the\ndata. He has supplied models which show this effect on the\n(u\u2212b)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd diagram and it clearly helps the (u\u2212b)ccd\ncolours at z = 1, while continuing to produce reasonable\ncolours for a spiral at z = 0. A 5-6 M\u2299 cut corresponds\nto an IMF with no stars earlier than about B2-B3 which\nmight be plausible, particularly if more massive stars are\nassumed to be preferentially cocooned in dust. A potential\nproblem with this or any other explanation which effectively\nreduces the slope of the UV s.e.d. for spirals is that the\nK+evolution correction at a given SFR may produce less\nbright galaxies at high redshift, causing our evolutionary\nmodel to underpredict the B counts, for example. Increasing\nthe SFR at early times to account for this might not be\npossible because the galaxy would evolve to be too red for\na spiral at z = 0.\nFlat UV spectra have also been observed in the spectra\nof local starburst galaxies. For example, Gonzalez Delgado et\nal. (1998) have obtained UV spectra of four local starbursts\nwith the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope and the Goddard\nHigh Resolution Spectrograph on HST. These authors show\nthat the spectral energy distribution follows f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\n\u03b2 with\n\u03b2 = \u22120.84 \u00b1 0.26. This is much flatter from the \u03b2 = \u22122.6\nto \u22122.2 they expect on similar grounds to our argument\nabove. They, however, believe that the prediction for \u03b2 is\nso stable that any deviation can be immediately interpreted\nas being caused by dust absorption. They obtain an average\nvalue of AB = 0.73 \u00b1 0.11 for their four starburst galaxies\nusing an LMC extinction law. They also obtain the relation\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.11\u2206\u03b2 where \u2206\u03b2 is the difference between\nthe observed and predicted slope. In our case \u2206\u03b2 \u223c3 and so\nAB \u223c 1.3. This is so large that the dust would redden the\ngalaxy colour predicted for an Sbc spiral by 0.6 magnitudes\nand a prime motivation for adopting the \u03c4 = 9Gyr model,\nthat it gave a blue enough colour for a present day spiral,\nwould then be lost. Gonzalez Delgado et al. also detect SiIV\nand CIV absorption lines with P Cygni profiles which is a\nsignature of O-type and early B-type stars. They suggest\nthat this argues against a bright IMF cut-off earlier than\nB2.\nSteidel et al. (1999) have fitted reddenings to their\nLyman-break galaxies and find values very similar to those\nwe use here, finding an average E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.15 for an\naverage AB \u223c 0.5 mag using the Calzetti (1997) absorp-\ntion law. However, E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.15 would only produce\na spectral slope change of \u2206\u03b2 = 1.2, and this is less than\nhalf what is needed to redden spiral (u \u2212 b)ccd colours to\nwhat is observed in the WHDF. Pettini et al. (2000) have\nalso detected P Cygni profiles in the spectra of the lensed\nLyman-break galaxy MS 1512-cB58 which again may indi-\ncate the presence of O-stars and argue against the existence\nof an upper mass cut-off. In this galaxy the spectral index\nimplies E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10 again close to what we have as-\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nSbc, q=0.05, Evoln.+1\/\u03bb dust\nSbc, q=0.05, Evoln. + Evolving dust\nb-\nr C\nCD\nr-iCCD\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n-1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\nSbc, q=0.05, Evoln.+1\/\u03bb dust\nSbc, q=0.05, Evoln. + Evolving dust\nb-\nr C\nCD\nu-bCCD\nFigure 31.

(b) As for (a) showing the\neffect of the evolving dust model on the model predictions for\n(r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd.\nsumed in our spiral models. However, this dust absorption\nimplies a far higher dust-gas ratio than seen in comparably\nlow-metallicity galaxies such as the LMC and SMC.\nOur view is that it may be unreasonable to invoke dust\nabsorption as high as E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.3 or AB = 1.3 mag\nto explain the (u\u2212 b)ccd colours of the z = 1 spirals in the\nWHDF. On the other hand it is clear that P-Cygni profiles\nof SiIV and CIV are seen in both Lyman-break galaxies and\nnearby starbursts. These features are seen in stars as late as\nB0 and a 5-6 M\u2299 cut would correspond to a cut at B2-B3.\nWe are therefore forced to consider another model where the\nevolution of the dust extinction law is now invoked to explain\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\nGalaxy number counts - V. Ultra-deep counts: The Herschel and Hubble Deep Fields 35\nthe red (u\u2212b)ccd colours of the WHDF data. Noting that the\n2200A\u02da feature helped redden (u\u2212 b)ccd as it passes through\nthe u band, we suggest that the high metallicity galaxies\nfound at low redshift may therefore show a 2200A\u02da feature\nas seen in the Milky Way. Then, since the predicted sharp\nfeature caused by the 2200A\u02da feature passing through the b\nband is not observed, we hypothesise that at higher redshifts\nthan z \u2248 0.6 the extinction law evolves to look more like\nthe extinction law seen in the low metallicity SMC, which\nis close to our 1\/\u03bb law. In this way, the strength of the\n2200A\u02da feature produces increased reddening as the u (and\nb) bands move towards 2200A\u02da than in (b \u2212 r)ccd at higher\nredshift when the 2200A\u02da feature has disappeared. We have\ntested this evolutionary model using the following simple\nevolutionary prescription to mimic this effect in the u band.\nA\u03bb = AB \u00d7 4400\/\u03bb, \u03bb > 2500A\u02da\nA\u03bb = AB \u00d7 (4400\/\u03bb + (9886\/\u03bb \u2212 3.9544) \u00d7 (1 \u2212\nexp(\u2212texp\/t))), \u03bb < 2500A\u02da\nwhere texp=8Gyr and t is the look back time. This ensures a\nsmooth transition from the 2200A\u02da feature dominated law at\nlow z to the 1\/\u03bb law at higher redshifts. This dust evolution\nthen produces a much redder (u\u2212 b)ccd at z = 1 while not\ndisturbing unduly the fit in (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd at either\nthis or higher redshift (see Fig. 31).\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have produced uccd, bccd, rccd and iccd galaxy number\ncounts and (u\u2212 b)ccd, (b\u2212 r)ccd and (r \u2212 i)ccd colours from\none 7\u2032\u00d77\u2032 field, on which we have the deepest ground-based\nB-band image yet taken. We also have deep H and K-band\nphotometry on this field (Paper IV, McCracken et al. in\nprep).\nWe have compared these data with our analysis of the\nHDF-N and HDF-S, produced using the same software. For\nthe UV and blue-bands, although the HDF\u2019s are deeper for\nunresolved objects, in terms of surface brightness signal-to-\nnoise our WHT image is \u223c 0.4 mag deeper, and also covers\n5 times the area. The counts from the datasets agree well,\nafter the ground-based data has been corrected for confu-\nsion. All are still rising at the faintest magnitudes, with a\nslope dlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.25. The HDF F606W counts are over\n2 magnitudes deeper than the previous equivalent ground-\nbased limits. They also show a still-rising count at the faint\nend with a slope dlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.25. The ground-based U\ncounts show an almost constant slope of dlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.4\nto U \u223c 25.5. However the HDF F300W counts flatten to a\nslope dlog(N)\/dm \u223c 0.15.\nThe deepest counts are the HDF-S STIS data, which\nreach to STISAB \u223c 30, which is roughly equivalent to R \u223c\n30. Our evolutionary models continue to fit to the limit of\nthese deepest optical number count data.\nIn terms of the comparison with evolutionary models,\nwe summarise our conclusions as follows:\n1. We have fitted simple exponential star-formation his-\ntory models to our data, and found that low q0 cosmologies\ngive a good fit from U toK over a range of \u223c 10 magnitudes.\nTo enable high q0 models to fit, an extra component must\nbe added to the galaxy population at high (z >\u223c 1) redshift.\nOne way of doing this is by adding a \u2018disappearing dwarf\u2019\ndE population which is bright and blue at high redshift and\nfaint and red at low redshift.\n2. At very bright magnitudes (B <\u223c 17) our count models\nfail and overpredict the counts. Since the steep count at\nB <\u223c 17 seems to be reproduced at the same level at R, I ,\nH and K, which is unlikely for an evolutionary explanation,\nthis represents strong evidence that the high normalisation\nwe have adopted for the counts is substantially correct.\n3. The models provide a good fit to the distributions of\ncolours in (b\u2212 r)ccd and (F450\u2212F606)vega and in (r\u2212 i)ccd\nand (F606 \u2212 F814)vega, although in both (u \u2212 b)ccd and\n(F300 \u2212 F450)vega the spiral models are too blue by 0.5\nmagnitudes at z = 1.\n4. The same models produce elliptical and spiral tracks\nin the colour-colour planes with shapes very similar to the\nloci of the data. The fact that the fit of our models is so good,\nparticularly in (r\u2212i)ccd : (b\u2212r)ccd for the ground-based data\nand (F606 \u2212 F814)vega : (F450 \u2212 F606)vega for the HDF,\ndata lends strong support to the underlying assumption that\nthe star-formation rate increases exponentially to beyond\nz = 2 (Metcalfe et al. 1996). It is clearly possible to use\n(R\u2212 I) : (B \u2212R) to probe the star-formation rate directly\nover a wide redshift range 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 3, emphasising the\npower of this colour-colour diagram as a diagnostic tool for\ngalaxy evolution.\n5. In the WHDF (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b\u2212 r)ccd plane, we detect\nan excess of low redshift(z \u2248 0.1), low luminosity early-\ntype galaxies which may have parameters consistent with\nthe \u2018disappearing dwarfs\u2019 invoked in our q0=0.5 evolutionary\nmodel.\n6. We have shown how the discrepancy with the z = 1\nSFR peak of Madau et al. (1996) comes from the differ-\nent treatment of dust and photometry in the HDF. When\nwe repeat the UV dropout SFR density measurement made\nin the 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 range by Madau et al. we find good\nself-consistency with the prediction of our exponentially in-\ncreasing SFR (\u03c4=9Gyr) spiral model.\n7. We have made new measurements of the SFR den-\nsity in the WHDF and in the HDF-N and HDF-S. In the\nredshift range 1 <\u223c z <\u223c 2 the WHDF SFR density lies lower\nthan the measurement of Connolly et al. (1997) in the HDF.\nThese measurements bracket the prediction of our \u03c4=9Gyr\nspiral model. In the 2 <\u223c z <\u223c 3.5 range our observed SFR\ndensity based on UV dropouts, corrected for dust and LF\nincompleteness, and the ground-based estimates of Steidel\net al. (1999) lie close to the HDF estimates and our model.\nAt 3.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.5 there is a wider spread, with the brighter\nground-based SFR estimates from the WHDF and Steidel\net al. generally being higher and closer to the model than\nthe HDF SFR estimates which are significantly lower than\nthe model.\n8. We have detected a population of galaxies that oc-\ncupy the same part of the (r \u2212 i)ccd : (b \u2212 r)ccd plane as\nz \u223c 3 UV dropout galaxies, but which do have measurable\nu-band fluxes. We have suggested that these may be candi-\ndates for high redshift galaxies that do not show UV dropout\nand that statistics of QSO absorption lines may not rule out\nsuch a population at z \u2248 3. The increase in SFR density at\nz \u2248 3 will depend on the fraction which prove to be at high\nredshift.\n9. We have created simulated CCD frames to check\nthe apparent sizes of galaxies predicted by our evolutionary\nc\u00a9 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201337\n36 N. Metcalfe, et al.\nmodels and found they are quite consistent with the sizes of\ngalaxies measured on the HDF-N.\n10. For the early-type models, the main remaining prob-\nlem is that although they produce reasonable fits to the\ndata at optical wavelengths, they predict too many high\nredshift (z >\u223c 1) galaxies at K \u223c 19 unless they have a\ndwarf-dominated stellar IMF. This reduces the evolutionary\nbrightening at infra-red wavelengths whilst still allowing suf-\nficient optical evolution. Dynamical merging may constitute\nan alternative explanation and this possibility has been ex-\nplored by other authors (eg Kauffmann & Charlot 1998).\n11. The main outstanding question for the spiral mod-\nels is why do they predict (u\u2212 b)ccd and (F300\u2212F450)vega\ncolours which are too blue in the range 0.5 <\u223c z <\u223c 1? We\nhave suggested that this problem is unlikely to be solved\nby the addition of more dust to the models because the\namount of dust needed is so great (AB \u223c 1.3 mag) that it\nwould lead to the model predicting (B \u2212 R) colours that\nare \u223c0.5 magnitudes too red for a z = 0 spiral. One possi-\nbility is that the spiral IMF is truncated above 5-6 M\u2299. It\nis the subject of continuing research to see if such a model\ncan produce enough evolution to continue to fit the steep\nB-band number-count slope. Another possible explanation,\nsuggested by the dust laws in nearby galaxies with different\nmetallicities, is that the dust extinction law evolves, with the\n2200A\u02da dust absorption feature appearing in high metallic-\nity galaxies at z <\u223c 0.5 and disappearing in lower metallicity\ngalaxies at higher redshift.\n12. The evolutionary q0=0.05 and q0=0.5 models cor-\nrectly predict the sky density of Lyman break z \u2248 3 galax-\nies detected by Steidel et al. (1999) from Keck spectroscopy.\nThe models suggest that these galaxies may be spiral galax-\nies which have undergone an exponentially increasing SFR\nwith look-back time. At z \u2248 4 these models generally over-\npredict the space density of sub-L\u2217 galaxies at faint limits\nin the HDF-N and HDF-S and WHDF by a factor of 5, sug-\ngesting that we may have reached an epoch of significant\ngalaxy formation. The z \u2248 4 luminosity function matches\nbest our q0=0.5 model with the dE population removed,\nsuggesting that one interpretation might be that bright L\u2217\ngalaxies were already in place at z = 4 but many fainter\ngalaxies formed at 3 <\u223c z <\u223c 4.
