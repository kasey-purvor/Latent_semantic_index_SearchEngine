In areas of the UK where \nsoils are light in texture and readily erodible this problem can be serious, with rates of \nerosion typically between 0.5 and 200 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121 (Chambers et al, 2000). Land in \nfallow and winter cereal crops are less susceptible to soil erosion than some other \ncrops (e.g. maize and potatoes) (Evans, 2002) but, as they have bare ground or low \ncrop cover during the autumn and winter they can still suffer large erosion losses \n(Chambers and Garwood, 2000). \nPhosphorus (P) binds to soil particles, and losses of P associated with soil particles are \noften linked to soil erosion.  Water erosion preferentially removes the finer fractions \nof the soil with which P is commonly associated.  This leads to P becoming \nconcentrated in overland flow (Quinton et al., 2001; Quinton, 2002). \nDiffuse P pollution, predominantly from agricultural sources (including fertiliser and \nanimal waste), presents a serious problem in the UK, contributing to the \neutrophication of waterways and standing water bodies (Haygarth et al., 2005).  \nSurface waters in the UK are strongly limited by P and even small additions can cause \neutrophication.  High inputs in the form of organic and inorganic fertilisers from \nagriculture have resulted in considerably higher levels of soil P than are utilised by the \ncrop plants, thus creating an increased potential for the transfer of P to the wider \nenvironment (Haygarth et al., 1998; Haygarth et al., 2005).   \nPotentially high levels of excess P in soils along with increases in soil erosion have \nled to large amounts of P being transported to waterways.  In recognition of this \nproblem, European legislation in the form of the Water Framework Directive \n(2000\/60\/EC) requires action to reduce diffuse P pollution as part of an objective of \n3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nrestoring waters to good ecological status.  This will require that mitigation options \nare introduced within fields, at field boundaries and adjacent to water bodies. \nAs a result of the research effort since the 1930s, there is a wide range of effective \nmitigation options for reducing soil erosion (see Chambers et al., 2000 for examples).  \nMuch less is known about how effective these mitigation options are for reducing the \nP losses that are associated with sediment.  This paper considers three treatments with \npotential for reducing sediment and P losses associated with combinable crops: \nminimum tillage, contour cultivation and in-field vegetative barriers.   \nMinimum tillage, which involves shallow tillage using a tine cultivator (Rasmussen, \n1999), has the potential to conserve organic matter, promote aggregate stability, \nincrease infiltration and reduce losses of sediment and sediment-bound pollutants \n(Quinton and Catt, 2004; Silgram and Shepherd, 1999).  In a review of studies \nevaluating minimum tillage, Strauss et al. (2003) found a median effectiveness of \n74% for reducing soil erosion.  Although the benefits for soil erosion are well \nestablished, the potential for reducing nutrient pollution is less clear. \nContour cultivation reduces runoff by increasing surface roughness perpendicular to \nthe slope.  The increased surface roughness reduces the velocity of any flowing water, \nproviding more time for infiltration and reducing erosion rates.  Although popular as a \nmeans of reducing soil losses in many parts of the world, contour cultivation has not \nbeen widely taken up in the UK due to concerns that machinery will overturn in wet \nconditions (Chambers et al., 2000).  Quinton and Catt (2004) demonstrated the \npotential benefits for reducing soil losses and runoff on sandy soils in the UK but, as \nwith minimum tillage, although the benefits for reducing soil erosion are well known, \nthere is less evidence available to indicate the benefits for P losses. \n4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nVegetative barriers have frequently been used as field-edge mitigation options but can \nalso be placed within fields along the contour, where they serve to reduce slope length \nand act as barriers to overland flow, thus retaining sediment from up slope.  Contour \ngrass strips have received some research attention and have been shown to reduce \nsediment losses.  In laboratory experiments, Ligdi and Morgan (1995) found contour \ngrass strips were effective in removing sediment on 5% and 10% slopes.  In a flume \nexperiment with different grasses and flow rates, Dabney et al. (1995) found contour \ngrass strips to range from 15 to 79% in their effectiveness.  In this study we used \nbeetle banks as vegetative barriers.  These raised banks are seeded with a wildflower \nand grass mix to attract invertebrates and are installed primarily for biodiversity \nbenefits.  Funding is available for farmers in the UK for the installation of beetle \nbanks under the Environmental Stewardship Entry Level Scheme (ELS), but uptake of \nthis option in the pilot scheme (1998\u20132000) was not high (ADAS, 2001). \nThis paper evaluates the potential for minimum tillage, contour cultivation and beetle \nbanks to reduce sediment and P losses from combinable crops; it will also examine \ntheir cost-effectiveness. \n \nMethods \nField Experiment \nIn 2005 a field experiment was established at Loddington in Leicestershire, central \nEngland (GB grid reference: SK795018).  The site is run by the Game Conservancy \nTrust\u2019s Allerton Project, which seeks to demonstrate means of farming profitably with \nminimal environmental impact.  Borderless hill-slope plots were established on a field \nwith soils consisting of Hanslope and Denchworth series clays on an erodible slope \n5 \nwith an angle varying between 2 and 6o.  The field was planted with wheat (Triticum \naestivum v. Solstice) in 2005 and oats (Avena sativa v. Gerald) in 2006. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nEight different treatments were applied (table 1, figure 1).  Half of the field was \ncultivated with minimum tillage using a disk cultivator with a maximum depth of \n15 cm and half was conventionally ploughed using a mouldboard plough with a \nmaximum depth of 18 cm. Each half of the field had three different cultivation \ntreatment areas (TA).  One TA from each tillage treatment was cultivated up and \ndown the slope and a second TA was ploughed on the contour, with a beetle bank \nacting as a vegetative barrier part-way up the slope.  In a third TA a mixed direction \ncultivation treatment was used in 2005\/6, with ploughing and drilling conducted up \nand down the slope and rolling and all subsequent operations conducted on the \ncontour.  In 2006\/7 this treatment was replaced with contour cultivation.  Each \ntreatment had three replicate collection tanks collecting runoff from unbounded plots \n(one tank had to be removed from the contour cultivation\/minimum tillage\/beetle \nbank combined treatment due to a perched water table surfacing within the plot, so \nthis treatment was only replicated twice).  Unbounded plots were 12 m wide and the \nlength of the hill slope was an average of 67 m.  Variation in slope length and angle \nwas small so is unlikely to have a large effect on the results.   \nRainfall and runoff were recorded between October and May in 2005\/6 and 2006\/7.  \nTanks were sampled after each rainfall event that generated runoff.  Runoff was \ncollected in 3 m troughs sunk into the ground so that they were flush with the soil \nsurface.  Clay soil from the site was packed around the troughs to give a smooth \nsurface for water to flow over and to ensure water was not infiltrating at the edges of \nthe troughs.  These were placed towards the base of the slope, and water and eroded \nsediment ran through pipes to a splitting device located on the top of each tank.  The \n6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nsplitting devices enabled collection of representative samples between 50% and \n12.5% of the total surface runoff, which could be adjusted depending on prevailing \nconditions.  Splitting devices were thoroughly evaluated and calibrated in the \nlaboratory before installation.  The collected runoff was stored in 500 litre tanks.  On \nseveral occasions the runoff volumes filled the tanks, causing them to overflow; on \nthese occasions a value for minimum runoff volume was measured. \nPrior to sample collection, water and sediment in the collection tanks was agitated \nthoroughly and a mixed water and sediment sample was taken for analysis.  Samples \nwere collected as soon as possible after the rainfall event to minimise \nadsorption\/desorption effects.  Samples were kept cool prior to analysis. \n \nLaboratory Methods \nThe mixed water and sediment samples collected were analysed for total P (TP) and \ntotal P <0.45 \u03bcm (TDP) using acid molybdate\/antinomy with ascorbic acid reduction \n(USEPA, 1985) and determined spectrophotometrically (880 nm) using a Seal \nAnalytical AQ2 analyser.  Particulate phosphorus (PP) was calculated as TP minus \nTDP.  Total suspended solids in the runoff samples were determined using a standard \nfiltration and drying technique using Whatman GF\/C filters with a pore size 1.2 \u03bcm \n(Bartram and Balance, 1996). \n \nStatistical Analysis \nData were analysed using repeated-measures analysis of variance, where runoff \nvariables were the dependant variables and treatment was the independent variable, \nand correlation coefficients.  Post-hoc analysis was conduced using Tukey honest \nsignificant difference test.  Data analysis was conducted using R (R Development \n7 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nCore Team, 2007) and SPSS (SPSS Inc, 2005). All data are presented as yields per \nhectare for overwinter losses.   \n \nCost-effectiveness Analysis \nTo determine the cost-effectiveness of the different approaches, simple spreadsheet \nmodels were constructed at the farm level. These spreadsheets calculated individual \ncrop margins and thence an overall arable rotation margin at the farm level in the \nplough up and down slope treatment (control scenario).  Impacts on this margin as a \nresult of the treatments undertaken were then incorporated into the spreadsheets. The \nmodels used data from the experimental work, the case study farm as a whole and \npublished data on prices and costs associated with each of the crop enterprises.  The \ndata from the experimental work were collected for each treatment in each year and \ninclude (i) the field records on crop establishment, fertiliser and spray applications, \nharvesting and yield, and (ii) the additional operations associated with the mitigation \noptions.  Additionally, the crops grown, their areas and average yield across the whole \nfarm were also collected for each year. \nIn the control scenario, \u2018operating\u2019 margins for each crop were calculated to reflect \nthe costs of crop establishment, fertiliser and agro-chemical applications, and \nharvesting.  This used crop yield and price to determine gross output. Seed, fertiliser \nand agro-chemical variable costs were then deducted to derive the gross margin. \nFinally, labour and machinery costs (which could be directly allocated to each crop \nenterprise, and were associated with establishment, fertiliser and agro-chemical \napplications, and harvesting) were deducted to derive an \u2018operating\u2019 margin.  This \noperating margin goes beyond an enterprise gross margin, as it includes some fixed \n8 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncosts; however, it is not a true net margin, as certain building, land and general \noverhead costs were excluded. \nTo calculate gross output, average crop yields from the 2006 and 2007 harvest years \nwere multiplied by October 2006 and 2007 market prices respectively (Farmers \nWeekly, 2006a,b; Farmers Weekly Interactive, 2007).  Variable cost data were \ninitially based upon standard costs taken from Nix (2005) and then amended to reflect \nactual practice using the field data provided. Nix provides price information on seeds, \nfertilisers and agro-chemicals prices, and uses these to calculate typical individual \ncrop gross margins.  Machinery and the associated labour costs were calculated based \nupon the number and type of operations undertaken, and as with the variable cost \ndata, were initially based upon average farmer cost data taken from Nix (2005).  The \ncalculations take into account the work rate possible on the medium\/heavy soils that \noccur at Loddington, and include fuel, labour requirement, repairs and depreciation \nbut exclude the more general overhead costs. \nThese margins were then used to produce a net return per average cropped hectare for \na typical arable operation, taking into account the difference in areas of crop grown. \nTo do this, each crop margin was multiplied by the percentage area that was grown on \nthe farm taken from the 2006 and 2007 harvest year farm records. \nFinally, variable and operating costs associated with each mitigation option were then \nincorporated to demonstrate the impact on the relevant crop operating margins and the \noverall average net return per hectare.  The calculations used the data from the farm \nfield records covering (i) crop establishment, fertiliser and spray application, and \nharvesting and (ii) the additional costs associated with the establishment of the beetle \nbank for each of the identified mitigation options. It was assumed that mitigation \ntakes place on all fields where cereal crops were grown.  A more accurate picture \n9 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwould be to determine what percentage of the land and hence cereal crop would \nrequire implementation of the mitigation option.  Average net return per hectare \nwould therefore be somewhere between the original and new margin.  This would not \nnecessarily be the case in reality.  The switch to minimum tillage and contour \ncultivation  is included in the model within the relevant crop operating margins, \nspecifically in terms of impacts on yield, fertiliser and agrochemical costs, and \nchanges to operational costs. Additional capital costs associated with the purchase of \nnew alternative equipment to undertake minimum cultivation were not included here.  \nConsideration was also given to the establishment of the vegetative strip.  There are \nadditional costs arising from establishment and annual maintenance requirements, loss \nof productive land and, potentially, the increased requirement for weed control in \nareas at the edge of the banks that cannot be cultivated.  The initial cost for the \nestablishment of a vegetative strip covers land preparation, sowing of grass seed and \ncutting in the first year.  A fully mechanised operation with plough, seedbed \ncultivation, drill and rolling is assumed. In subsequent years, regular topping of the \nvegetation may be required.  As a one-off capital cost, the initial cost of establishment \nis not included within the crop enterprise operating margins.  The costs associated \nwith the reduction in arable area are more difficult to calculate. In addition to the \ndirect loss of arable land, there are potential costs associated with reduced field size, \nslower work rate and as a result increased crop enterprise operational costs.  This is \ndependent on farm size, arable area, field sizes, slopes and opportunity to incorporate \nsuch strips within field.  In practice, areas taken for the vegetative strip would \nprobably be less than one hectare, allowing for some reduction in cost if the area was \nsmall enough to be seeded by hand. \n \n10 \nResults 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMonitored Events \nA total of 20 events were monitored from October to May 2005\/6 and October to May \n2006\/7.  Ten events were monitored in each year.  Total rainfall was 382 mm in \n2005\/6  and 359 mm in 2006\/7.  The mean event size was 38 mm in 2005\/6 and \n36 mm in 2006\/7, but variability in event size was greater in 2005\/6 than 2006\/7 \n(Figure 2).  Compared to mean rainfall (1998\u20132007), rainfall in the first sampling \nseason was below average for the first five months, but then exceeded the average for \nthe remaining months.  In the second sampling season, rainfall considerably exceeded \naverages during November, January, February and March.  With the exception of \nApril, when rainfall was very low, all other months were close to average rainfall. \n \nSurface Runoff \nTotal surface runoff (Figure 3a) and the event runoff coefficients (percentage of \nrainfall lost as runoff) were higher in 2006\/7 than in 2005\/6.  In year 1 there was a \nsignificant effect of treatment on runoff (F=9.699, p<0.001).  Post-hoc analysis \nshowed significantly more (p<0.01) runoff from the mixed direction treatment (PL \nmix) (1.93 mm) than the treatment ploughed up and down slope (PL) (0.24 mm).  \nThere was also significantly more (p<0.01) runoff with the PL mix treatment than the \nplough contour cultivation and beetle bank treatment (PL C BB) (0.17 mm), MT \n(0.51 mm) and MT C BB treatments (0.66 mm).  The minimum tillage mixed \ndirection treatment (MT mix) (1.85 mm) resulted in significantly more (p<0.01) \nrunoff than the MT C BB treatment and the MT treatment. \nIn year 2 there was no significant effect of treatment on runoff (F=1.97, p=0.16).     \n \n11 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSuspended Sediment \nSuspended sediment losses were also greater in year 2 than year 1 (Figure 3b).  In \nyear 1 there was a significant effect of treatment on sediment losses (F=11.93, \np<0.001).  The mixed direction treatments PL mix (5.2 kg ha\u22121) and MT mix  \n(17 kg ha\u22121) treatments were mainly responsible for this. MT mix had significantly \nhigher (p<0.05) losses than the PL (1.1 kg ha\u22121), PL C BB (0.4 kg ha\u22121), MT \n(3.4 kg ha\u22121) and MT C BB (3.7 kg ha\u22121) treatments. \nIn year 2 there was also a significant effect of treatment on sediment loss (F=3.06, \np=0.05).  Post-hoc analysis showed no significant differences between individual \ntreatments. \n \nTotal Phosphorus \nFigure 3c shows variability within treatments was very large.  In year 1 there was a \nsignificant effect of treatment on TP losses (F=9.86, p<0.001). This was \npredominantly driven by the high losses from the mixed direction tillage treatments, \nPL mix (0.017 kg P ha\u22121) and MT mix (0.037 kg ha\u22121) .  MT mix showed significantly \nhigher (p<0.01) losses than the PL (0.029 kg P ha\u22121), PL C BB (0.002 kg P ha\u22121), MT \n(0.009 kg P ha\u22121) and MT C BB (0.01 kg P ha\u22121) treatments.  Year 2 showed no \nsignificant effect of treatment on TP (F=2.21, p=0.13).   \nAs with runoff and sediment, TP losses were much higher in year 2 than year 1 for all \ntreatments conducted over two years.  \n \nTotal Dissolved Phosphorus \nThe difference in losses between years 1 and 2 is less than that observed for other \nrunoff variables.  Variability in the data is much lower than other runoff variables \n12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n(Figure 3d). Differences in TDP losses were proportionally much lower than \ndifferences between TP losses.   \nExamining year 1 data shows a significant effect of treatment on TDP losses (F=6.74, \np<0.05).  Significantly higher losses (p<0.05) were found from the PL mix \n(0.0026 kg P ha\u22121) treatment compared to the PL C BB (0.0006 kg P ha\u22121) and PL \n(0.0008 kg P ha\u22121), MT (0.0014 kg P ha\u22121) and MT C BB (0.0012 kg P ha\u22121) \ntreatments.   \nIn year 2 there was no significant effect of treatment on TDP losses (F=2.06, p=0.14).   \n \nParticulate Phosphorus \nPP losses were higher in year 2 than in year 1. Results for PP losses were similar to \nsediment losses.  In year 1 there was a significant effect of treatment on PP \n(F=13.118, p<0.001).  As with sediment losses, the MT mix (0.0322 kg P ha\u22121) \ntreatment was mainly responsible for this, with significantly higher (p<0.05) losses \nthan the PL (0.0016 kg P ha\u22121), PL C BB (0.0009 kg P ha\u22121), PL (0.0015 kg P ha\u22121) \nand MT C BB (0.0077 kg P ha\u22121) treatments. \nIn year 2 there was no significant effect of treatment on PP loss (F=2.21, p=0.12).  . \n \nCost-effectiveness Analysis \nTable 2 illustrates the 2006 and 2007 cropping areas and, based upon this, an average \n\u2018operating margin\u2019 per hectare for the case study farm.  Table 3 shows the financial \nimpact of the introduction of the various mitigation options on the \u2018operating\u2019 margin \nin each year.  Field records from both years show that no changes in terms of fertiliser \nor agro-chemical applications were required and that there were no impacts on yield. \nIn the long term, this may not be the case.     \n13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe switch to a minimum tillage system, as is to be expected, reduces establishment \ncosts and thereby increases the operating margin.  However, it can increase certain \nweed burdens, giving rise to increased agrochemical costs. This has not been the case \nso far.  \nThe change to operating across the contour has not been explicitly costed.  In reality, \nadditional time spent in the field as a result of a reduced work rate will increase the \noperational costs per hectare associated with crop establishment, and, potentially, \nfertiliser application and spraying of agrochemicals. Many farmers are reluctant to \nadopt contour cultivation because of the difficulties with cultivation and spraying \noperations. Furthermore, it would only be possible on a limited number of slopes. \nProvisional estimates for the establishment of the vegetative strip suggest a cost of \nestablishment of \u00a3163 ha\u22121 and ongoing annual maintenance cost of \u00a321 ha\u22121. The \ncosts associated with reducing field size and increasing operational costs amount to \nbetween \u00a31 and \u00a32  ha\u22121 and are incorporated within the resultant operating margin. \n \nDiscussion  \nMonitored events \nTotal surface runoff, losses of sediment and losses of TP were generally much higher \nin year 2 than in year 1.  The large variation between years demonstrates the need for \nlonger term monitoring.  There was also large variability between plots and events \nwithin treatments.   \nIn year 1 overwinter losses of sediment (range for treatment means 0.4-17 kg ha\u22121) \nwere lower than the average losses for tillage land in England and Wales reported by \nChambers et al. (2000) (160\u2013123,000 kg ha\u22121).  Losses of sediment in year 2 of this \nexperiment (33-184 kg ha\u22121) were closer to the range reported by Chambers et al. \n14 \n(2000).  P losses from the experiment in year 2 (0.04\u20130.16 kg P ha\u22121) were lower than \naverage losses from agriculture-dominated catchments in the UK (Ul\u00e9n et al., 2007) \n(0.5 kg P ha\u22121) and at the lower end of the range for reported losses from tillage land \nin England and Wales (0.16\u201394 kg P ha\u22121) (Chambers et al. 2000), although in year 1 \nlosses were lower (0.002\u20130.03 kg P ha\u22121).   \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \nMinimum tillage \nA review of the literature comparing minimum tillage to ploughing suggests minimum \ntillage commonly results in a significant reduction in surface runoff and sediment \nlosses (Strauss et al., 2003), but reductions were not observed at this site.  There were \nno significant reductions in runoff or sediment losses in the minimum tillage \ntreatments compared to plough treatments, in the plots ploughed up and down, in \nthose ploughed on the contour, or in those ploughed on the contour with a beetle bank.  \nExamination of the data did not reveal any apparent, but non-significant differences. \nTP and PP losses also showed a very similar pattern.  As losses of TP across all \ntreatments were strongly driven by sediment losses across all treatments (r2=0.92, \np<0.01), this is not surprising.  Losses of TDP showed a slightly different result, with \na trend towards higher losses of TDP from the MT treatment than the plough \ntreatment in year 1.  In year 2 this was not the case with no significant difference \nbetween treatments.  The higher losses observed in year 1 could be due to P \nconcentrating at the surface of the soil and an increase in organic matter (Bertol et al., \n2007; Saveedra et al., 2007).  Saavedra et al. (2007) found significantly higher organic \nmatter contents in soils under minimum tillage than those under conventional tillage.  \nThey also found higher TP, Olsen P and organic P concentrations, but these \ndifferences were not significant.  A small plot study study with intense rainfall in \n15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBrazil on a Hapludox soil (68% clay, 21% silt, 11% sand) showed P concentrations in \nthe upper 0\u20130.025 m of a soil with no-tillage cultivation were over five times those in \nthe conventional tillage after four years of treatment (Bertol et al., 2007). \nThe reduced establishment costs associated with minimum tillage may make this \noption more appealing to farmers.  However, at higher prices for output (as was seen \nin 2007) moving to minimum tillage has less of a percentage impact than at lower \nprices, although the actual (absolute) change is the same. The lack of a significant \nreduction in P and sediment losses with minimum tillage means that although costs \nare not increased overall, this cultivation is not cost-effective. \n \nMixed direction tillage \nThe mixed direction tillage treatment presents an advantage over contour cultivation: \nit avoids conducting the tillage and drilling across the slope, which many farmers feel \npresents a risk of vehicles slipping down slope or tipping over.  The mixed direction \ntillage treatment resulted in significantly higher losses of runoff, sediment and PP \ncompared to all other treatments.    Losses of TP and TDP were significantly higher \nfrom the mixed direction minimum tillage treatment and there was a clear trend for \nhigher losses in the plough mixed direction tillage, although this was not significantly \ndifferent from other plough treatments (Figure 3d).  However, it is possible that longer \nmay be required for the treatment to have an effect. \nAlthough mixed direction tillage offers some advantages for farmers over contour \ncultivation, it is clearly not beneficial to controlling soil erosion or nutrient losses.  \nFarmers working on similar soils would be better using up and down slope \ncultivations than using the mixed direction tillage.  These high sediment and P losses \nare likely to be a result of the contour rolling following up and down slope tillage \n16 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwhich formed a series of slightly raised, loose soil micro-ridges on the soil surface.  \nCrop alignment encouraged water movement down slope as in the up and down slope \ncultivations, but these micro-ridges were too small to impede flow, instead providing \na source of easily erodible soil.  This measure would not be cost-effective given \nincreased losses and increased labour costs in cultivating across the slope. \n \nContour cultivation \nThe contour cultivation treatment was established in year 2 of the experiment.  \nContour cultivation did not result in a significant reduction in surface runoff when \ncompared to up and down cultivation in either the plough or minimum tillage plots.  \nHowever figure 3a shows that there was quite a large difference between the \ntreatments, with a mean reduction of 72.2% although this ranged from 9 to 98%. \nSediment losses followed a very similar pattern to runoff (Figure 3b),  This was the \nsame for TP, TDP (Figures 3c and d) and PP.  Although the results were not \nstatistically significant, the strong trends in the data suggest that there are benefits to \nbe gained from using contour cultivation to reduce runoff sediment and P losses.   \nThere are additional costs associated with contour cultivation tillage, primarily \nadditional time spent in the field which will increase operational costs compared with \ntraditional cultivation.  Many farmers are reluctant to adopt contour cultivation \nbecause of difficulties with cultivation and spraying operations (Quinton and Catt, \n2004), but with the right incentive this measure could be cost-effective. \n \nBeetle Bank \nData collected from the beetle bank and contour cultivation treatment did not show a \nsignificant reduction in surface runoff compared to up and down slope cultivation.  \n17 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nThere was no significant difference between runoff from the beetle bank plots than \nfrom the contour cultivation plots.  Figure 3a shows that this difference is small and \nvariability was large.  Sediment losses, TP and PP losses again show a similar pattern \nto surface runoff.  In both years there was no significant difference between TDP \nlosses from the beetle bank treatment and the plough treatment and figure 3d shows \nthat the mean loss was actually slightly higher from the beetle bank plots than the up \nand down slope cultivation in year 1. \nFor all of the runoff variables considered there were only minor reductions in losses \nprovided by the beetle bank treatment compared to the contour cultivation treatment.  \nIn order for a beetle bank to be placed on the contour, contour cultivation needs to be \nused.  Beetle banks are potentially problematic for farmers, not only requiring contour \ncultivation, but also resulting in a loss of land and potentially introducing weeds in the \nareas at the end of banks that cannot be cultivated.    They also result in additional \ncost to the farmer both through increased operational costs and a loss of productive \nland.  Installing beetle banks as a measure to improve water quality may not seem \nvery beneficial, but they do have a proven benefit for invertebrate diversity (Thomas \net al., 2002).  If beetle banks are going to be installed as a conservation measure to \nenhance invertebrate diversity, placing them on the contour combined with contour \ncultivation is likely to have increased benefits for water quality when compared to \ncontour cultivation alone.  Given the additional costs associated with their installation \nand the minimal reduction in erosion losses, beetle banks are only cost-effective for \nfarmers to install where there are gains for biodiversity. \n \nConclusion \n18 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nMinimum tillage did not reduce or increase diffuse pollution when compared to the \ncontrol, although it may be beneficial in other situations and reduces operating \nmargins.  \nMixed direction tillage resulted in increases in surface runoff, sediment and P losses \nand is not recommend as a mitigation option.  Contour cultivation gave much more \npositive results:  although differences were not significant, mean sediment and P \nlosses were much lower.   However, the additional time input required for cultivations \nand safety concerns mean that this option may not be popular with farmers. \nThe beetle bank generates additional costs for the farmer and although it provides \nsignificant reductions in runoff variables compared to up and down slope cultivation, \nthere is only a marginal benefit compared to contour cultivation alone.  The additional \nbiodiversity benefits of beetle banks mean that there is potential for their installation \nto benefit water quality if they are placed on the contour. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis project is funded by the UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs \n(Defra) (project PE0206).
