New \ndisciplines and sub-disciplines, as well as institutions, were founded to come up \nwith answers, while many artists and writers also became preoccupied with \nfacets of urban knowledge. \u201eOne walked, of course, with one\u201fs eyes greatly open\u201f, \nHenry James disingenuously remarks in the Preface to The Princess \nCasamassima.2 \nA trio of Americans, Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882-1966), Henry James \n(1843-1916), and Joseph Pennell (1857-1926), were demonstrably attracted to \nLondon. Their photographs, writings and drawings, respectively, speculate about \nits temporal, spatial and phenomenological thresholds: where the city begins and \nends; how the visible and invisible (or hidden) dimensions of the city abut each \nother; and how part and whole relate, and according to what measure and from \nwhat point of view. Although their professional associations are a convenient \nrationale for this essay,3 it is the interplay of phrases, anecdotes, narratives, \nframes, and perspectives, across written and visual forms that open up what are, \nin the end, intriguing theoretical insights. Coburn, James and Pennell came up \n 2 \nagainst a challenge central to modernity: how to represent not simply what could \nbe seen but also the hidden forces that have shaped a city, and would continue \nto shape it into the future.  London had a population of nearly six million people, \nwas the capital of the British Empire, and was engulfing surrounding towns, while \ncontinuing to extend its influence internationally. Accordingly, though not \nstraightforwardly, London precipitated debates over representation, located, at \nthat time, along the shifting fault-line between Realism and Modernism. It also \noccasioned apprehension about the urban future. Near the end of E. M. Forster\u201fs \nHowards End (1910), Helen Schlegel observes that \u201eLondon\u201fs creeping\u201f, as the \n\u201ered rust\u201f of a previously invisible city appeared on the horizon. \u201eAnd London is \nonly part of something else\u201f, she adds. Friedrich Engels, writing more than half a \ncentury before, supplies a corresponding perspective from within its boundaries:  \nA town, such as London, where a man may wander for hours without \nreaching the beginning of the end, without meeting the slightest hint \nwhich could lead to the inference that there is open country within reach, \nis a strange thing.4 \nCoburn, James and Pennell were intrigued by the phenomenon of the \ncity, even as they focussed on individual cities. Among other cities, James wrote \nabout New York, earlier and later in his career in Washington Square (1880) and \nThe American Scene (1907), and Venice and Florence in essays from the 1870s \nto 1890s collected in Italian Hours (1909). He reserved some of his most \nmelodramatic pronouncements for London, \u201ethe murky modern Babylon\u201f of his \n1888 essay, \u201eLondon\u201f, and went on to explore the \u201edeepest abyss of all the \nwonderments that break out for the student of great cities\u201f, as he put it in the \nPreface to In the Cage (1898). In this and other Prefaces, he reconsidered the \ncities of some of his fiction in the company of Alvin Langdon Coburn, during their \ndeliberations over what would make appropriately symbolic frontispieces for The \nNovels and Tales of Henry James, better known as the New York Edition (1907-\n09). Their association enhanced Coburn\u201fs Modernist credentials, at a time when \n 3 \nhe, too, was embarking on an exploration of cities that would shortly culminate in \na selection of striking photographs for two books, London, which appeared in \nquite different versions in 1909 and 1914, and New York (1910), and in \nunrealised plans for a book to be entitled The Adventures of Cities. Joseph \nPennell\u201fs visual explorations of two cities, in particular, are now appreciated \nindependently from his many commissions to illustrate essays and fiction. Sidney \nDark wrote a supporting text for London (1924), containing fifty-five drawings, \ndating from 1908, but never before reproduced. Pennell\u2019s New York Etchings, a \ncollection of ninety prints from the Picker Art Gallery, was published in 1980. It is \ngermane to one of the strands in this essay to note that Pennell\u201fs style changed, \nshortly after he contributed illustrations to James\u201fs \u201eLondon\u201f, becoming more \nImpressionistic and loosely Modernist throughout the 1890s. This accorded with \nhis stout defence of drawing and painting against photography\u201fs aesthetic \nadvances. When James\u201fs essay was reprinted in English Hours in 1905, \naccompanied by a few more London essays, Pennell provided a completely new \nset of illustrations.5 \nII \nFor a start, James has to get himself across the threshold into London from \nsomewhere else, a process that makes one pause to think whether any \ncomparable conundrum confronts visual artist when framing a city sight and \ndrawing limits. In the single essay, \u201eLondon\u201f, an account of the city that he had \nlived in since 1876, there is a good deal of getting there, just as, in \u201eAn English \nEaster\u201f (1877), James is three-quarters through an essay about a visit to \nRochester, Canterbury and Dover and has still not left London. \u201eThe sense of \napproach\u201f to London jolts him over breakfast at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool, \nshortly after docking, and he prolongs his meditation by taking \u201ethe slowest of \nSunday trains, pottering up to London\u201f, and then spinning out \u201evirtually a first \nimpression\u201f in the cab that takes him and his luggage from Euston to Morley\u201fs \nHotel, Trafalgar Square. There is a tension between James\u201fs growing sense of \n 4 \nhimself as an author, and one who is particularly at home in cities, and the \ncounterweight of London.  The former comes out most strongly, if still \nambiguously in the Prefaces to the New York Edition near the end of his career, \nbut authorial power is evident in this early essay in his highly self-conscious \ncapturing of London in a phrase.  Set against James\u201fs rhetorical assertions, \nhowever, is his acknowledgement of London as, seemingly, preoccupied with its \nown past, present and future, and with what James, from time to time, invokes \nas its \u201elaws\u201f, meaning the manifestation of hidden forces.  \nJames also expands his authority over the city by skillfully \nmanipulating narrative time in the essay.  He locates the city\u201fs present, the \u201enow\u201f \nof London, by bringing his own story up to date. In effect, he ushers the reader \ninto his own present: \nPractically, of course, one lives in a quarter, in a plot [of the city]; but in \nimagination, and by a constant mental act of reference, the sympathizing \nresident inhabits the whole \u2013 and it is only of him that I deem it worth \nwhile to speak. \nIn re-introducing himself as a London resident for over a decade, and putting to \none side the visitor that he had earlier been, James assuredly crosses the \nthreshold and fully enters the city, taking possession of it in the present tense.  \nMore than this, though, James seeks to create the necessary margin from which, \nin a moment of insight, he can bring together the part and the whole of the city: \n[The resident] fancies himself, as they say, for being a particle in so \nunequalled an aggregation; and [London\u201fs] immeasurable circumference, \neven though unvisited and lost in smoke, gives him a sense of social and \nintellectual elbow-room.6 \nAt about the time when \u201eLondon\u201f was re-published in English Hours \n(1905), with Joseph Pennell\u201fs new drawings for all of the essays, James initiated \na collaboration with Alvin Langdon Coburn. Those years overlapped with what \nMike Weaver calls Coburn\u201fs \u201eSymbolist period, in which he made his great \n 5 \ncontribution to photography\u201f.7 James threw himself into his work with Coburn, \nperceiving a synergy with the photographer\u201fs symbolist aesthetic, which he \nbolstered with robust instructions: \u201eOnce you get the type into your head, you \nwill easily recognise specimens by walking in the old residential and \u201enoble\u201f parts \nof the city\u201f.8 They worked most closely on the five London photographs, but it is \nilluminating to bring two of these together with a selection of other Coburn \nphotographs of London from the same period. These photographs, accompanied, \nwhere it is helpful, by James\u201fs commentary, test their common ambition to cross \nthe urban threshold by means of a symbolic aesthetic that proposes to unite the \nvisible and the invisible aspects of a city. \nThe \u201eunequalled aggregation\u201f and \u201eimmeasurable circumference\u201f of \nLondon is not approached narratively by Coburn, as it is, however circuitously, by \nJames in the opening pages of \u201eLondon\u201f, when he establishes his right to \nresidency and, with it, to an overview. Instead, Coburn opts for a pictured \ntotality, in line with his emerging symbolist aesthetics. In St. Paul\u2019s from Ludgate \nCircus (1905), the cathedral is given centrality because it over-shadows the \nforeground, other than where smoke blocks the view, and out-shines the other \ndomes and steeples on the skyline. In St. Paul\u2019s from the River (c. 1906)9 and \nalso in The Dome of St Paul\u2019s (c. 1906), which is the photograph James approved \nas the frontispiece to The Princess Casamassima (1886) (see figure 1), the \npictorial and historical authority of the dome is confirmed by the use made of the \nRiver Thames.  \nIn many of his cityscapes, as well as his landscapes, Coburn follows \nthe example of pictorial photography and seeks out and enhances what he calls \nthe \u201eliquid surfaces\u201f, produced by light on water. The language of \u201epresentment\u201f, \n\u201erecognition\u201f, \u201etransfiguration\u201f, and \u201etype\u201f used by James to guide Coburn in his \nsearch for appropriate images is entirely apposite, and not simply for Coburn\u201fs \nlocal commission, but equally, for Coburn\u201fs preferred pictorialism and its \nmaturation into a symbolist aesthetic. Thus, a patch of light on the River Thames \n 6 \nin St. Paul\u2019s from the River sits directly under St. Paul\u201fs and an arch of the old \nWaterloo Bridge. The lit-up river, prominent, too, in The Dome of St. Paul\u2019s \n(1905-06) consigns other aspects of the scene to the static margins, while \nserving to reinforce the Cathedral as a symbol of London\u201fs soul. In 1935, Coburn \nretrospectively generalised his aesthetic: \nOne by one material things come to be known for what they are, beautiful \nsymbols of still more beautiful Realities. One by one they are taken into \nthe mind and their outward forms transcended until in the end only the \nRealities themselves are contemplated, and at last the soul comes to \nbehold the One Reality face to face, and symbolism is overpassed. \nFor Mike Weaver, building on Coburn\u201fs pronouncement, St. Paul\u2019s from the River \nexemplifies a hierarchy of interpretation: \n[It] may be read at several levels. Literally, it is a picture of St. Paul\u201fs \nCathedral, Waterloo Bridge, and the River Thames. Figuratively, it unites \na dome, a bridge, and a river. Allegorically, it offers a dome of knowledge, \nsupported on pillars of Wisdom, over the Great Flood. Anagogically, it \nshows eternity triumphing over time.10 \nThese statements, from James as commissioning novelist, Coburn, \nhimself, and Coburn\u201fs best critic, sum up a compelling understanding of Coburn, \nat least in the period of his London work. Yet, it requires a dedicated adherent of \na symbolist aesthetic and the synechdochal claims upon which it rests, to ignore \nthe literal or discursive level of content in Coburn\u201fs photographs. Content is a \ndimension that photography records more effectively than any other medium \n(with the exception of the movies), even when techniques, such as the soft-focus \nand telephoto lens used by Coburn at that time, increase opacity and promote \npictorial flatness. Coburn complained that \u201ethe camera if left to its own devices \nwill simply impart local information to the exclusion of everything else\u201f.11 \nPhotography\u201fs other defining characteristics are the simultaneous capturing of a \nmoment in time and a point of view in space, and the implied world continuing \n 7 \nbeyond the frame.  Later, we can acknowledge that these, too, prove to be a \ncheck upon the dominant symbolism of Coburn\u201fs London photographs and, \ntherefore, are factors in assessing how cities can be known. \nSt Paul\u2019s from the River is as perfectly composed a photograph as one \nmight imagine, but composition works both ways, and can highlight, as well as \nrelegate, the literal, discursive content. The flatness that derives particularly \nfrom the positioning of the dome, as though it sits on the bridge, creates \ncompositional unity but also provokes speculation about what possible frame \ncould contain potentially discordant elements. The river strikes us immediately as \na shimmering image. But, then, a cluster of boats moored near Waterloo Bridge \nis associated compositionally, by means of two boats in mid-stream, with the \nriver. The river is thereby re-animated, though less as a \u201eliquid surface\u201f, in which \nmovement is somehow not to or from anywhere, but, as the Thames, flowing \neastwards to the sea as London\u201fs greatest trade route and source of financial \nliquidity. Similarly, the spires of St. Paul\u201fs and other churches stand out from the \nmass of undifferentiated buildings to reach towards the halo of light in a lowering \nsky. They overlook mere trade on the river. Henry James had much to say in The \nAmerican Scene about the skyscrapers of New York which, as \u201emonsters of the \nmere market\u201f dominated, from above, the spire of Trinity Church on Broadway.12 \nIn Coburn\u201fs remarkable photographs of London, an equally significant \nrelationship between religion and trade is proposed by means of a compositional \nlink in a flat plane that seeks to transcend the historically contingent sphere. It is \nnot exactly a reversal of James\u201fs regret on behalf of Trinity Church, but St. Paul\u201fs \nendorses the material activities below by appearing to rise from the bridge, \nreminiscent of the shops and merchants\u201f premises of Florence\u201fs Ponte Vecchio. \nA \u201eliquid surface\u201f is, again, prominent, even central, in Coburn\u201fs close-\nup view of the river, Waterloo Bridge (1906).13 It separates the foreground from \nthe background, where we have a glimpse of buildings on the far bank of the \nriver. Yet, the relatively small patch of light, far from \u201eoverpassing\u201f \u2013- as Coburn \n 8 \nwould have it -- the day-to-day details of work, is circumscribed by what the \nphotograph also tells us of the past work of building the bridge, and the present \nwork on the river. Taken almost at river level, Waterloo Bridge depicts a river of \ntrade, with the prow of a working boat jutting out from the bottom left corner, \nsmaller boats visible under the arch of the bridge, and the brickwork of the \nbridge. This is an alternative to Coburn\u201fs London Bridge (1905), in which the \nsuperstructure is pre-eminent, with its business end and physical infrastructure \nhidden. Waterloo Bridge is structurally similar to The Tower Bridge (c. 1906), \nin which the working aspects also occupy most of the photograph, but compete, \nfor impact, with the familiar imposing bridge structure in the background.14 \n \nFigure 1: Alvin Langdon Coburn, The Dome of St Paul\u2019s, frontispiece to The \nPrincess Casamassima, The Novels and Tales of Henry James, V, Book Collection, \nHarry Ransom Humanities Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin. \n \nThe banks of the Thames feature in a number of Coburn\u201fs photographs, \nin spite of the ostensible interest in more elevated cultural icons along the river. \n 9 \nIn The Dome of St. Paul\u2019s (see figure 1), Coburn catches the current running fast \nunder the old Southwark Bridge, the light on the water, and the silhouette of the \ncathedral on the far side of the bridge. St. Paul\u201fs may be distant, and vague, but \nits height and cultural resonance ensure prominence, not least in the title of the \nphotograph. However, the foreground of The Dome of St. Paul\u2019s is occupied by \nthe muddy edge of the Thames, lapped by small waves. On the right-hand side of \nthe photograph, the upright of a riverside structure (probably Cannon Street \nRailway Bridge), figures as an internal part-frame. It serves to draw the eye \ndown from the sphere of St. Paul\u201fs to the foreground. This muddy space, which, \ntwice a day, disappears with the flood tide, is also the point of view from which \nthe photograph is taken: the south bank of the Thames, at low tide. The \nthreshold between land and water is vague. From this unprepossessing \nforeground, the photograph takes on a subtle difference from those in which \nshimmering light and the mystery of Impressionist-like distance from the object \nare invariably dominant. \nJean-Paul Sartre\u201fs comments on a related phenomenon, slime, pin-\npoint two contrasting characteristics of the river conveyed by Coburn in The \nDome of St. Paul\u2019s. Sartre\u201fs description, \u201ethe permanence within change that \nwater has\u201f, is akin to what Coburn is getting at in his phrase \u201eliquid surface\u201f. But, \nthen, Sartre adds, there is the \u201eaberrant fluid\u201f that is slime, \u201ethe agony of water\u201f. \nHe designates slime an \u201eantivalue\u201f, and there is something of this in the mud that \nCoburn portrays, though the idea of mud as a boundary between states is more \npertinent. This boundary comes and goes, but does so within the city, rather \nthan at the rural edge of London marked by the old house in E. M. Forster\u201fs novel \nof the same period. In The Dome of St. Paul\u2019s there is a rivulet coming in from \nthe left and crossing the mud, an outlet for water or sewage from the city, one \nwould think, and a tiny instance of the circulation of the city\u201fs water; just as the \nThames was, even in the great age of the railways, a major instance of the \ncirculation of trade. A common stage in city-formation has been the incorporation \n 10 \nwithin the city\u201fs systems of locations and their associated activities that were \nonce firmly consigned to areas outside of the city walls: cemeteries, waste-\ndisposal, even some markets.15 The mud-bank between high and low tide is an \nintriguing sign of this process of absorption, being both centrally inside the city \nand at an edge that appears and disappears; and, to rely on Sartre once more, is \n\u201ealready almost a solid permanence\u201f, a \u201esticky thickness in its liquidity\u201f.16 In one \nof his most famous London photographs, The Embankment (1906), the tide is \nhigher, and the edge has become more solid: a curve of streetlamps and trees on \nthe embankment, with, above it, once again, the dome of St. Paul\u201fs, and, below \nit, the river. Not all of the lamps can be reflected in the river, however, because \nthe water only partially covers the mud, an ambiguous sign of what is and is not \nthe city.  \nAt the time when Coburn was photographing St. Paul\u201fs from the edge \nof the Thames -- as a frontispiece to James\u201fs one attempt, twenty years earlier, \nat a sustained treatment of the urban working class in The Princess Casamassima \n-- these muddy edges would still have been the location for small boats to be \nlaunched and moored, and for a scavenging trade in goods, and also in people \nwho lacked the comfort of James, in his resident-alien category. The muddy \nedges are the sphere of the everyday, and of the river as a working space and, \ntherefore, in terminology given resonance by Kevin Lynch in The Image of the \nCity, a place for some people, yet a place that was not always in sight, and \nhidden from the official iconology of the city. For all their preoccupation with the \nfamous sights of London, many of Coburn\u201fs photographs keep the all-but-hidden \nin view.17 \nThe composition of Wapping (c. 1905)18 shows the Japanese influence \non Coburn in flattening the plane of the photograph, yet also tells us that James \nand Coburn\u201fs quest to find, in James\u201fs expression, the \u201espirit of the great city\u201f has \nto acknowledge the co-existence of work. Evidently, work has taken over both \nsides of the river. On the nearside are the posts of a dock, the sails and rigging \n 11 \nof a moored schooner, and a small boat and oarsman just offshore. There are no \nfamous buildings in sight, and even the high-street of Wapping, itself, is replaced, \non the far bank, by the Thames-side warehouses, \u201ethese rigidly unfeatured \nedifices\u201f. These are James\u201fs words when describing a day-trip by boat from \nWestminster to Greenwich. James continues, blithely crossing the border \nbetween form and contingent historical circumstances, between the city and its \nvast hinterland: \nall this sordid detail reminds me of nothing less than the wealth and \npower of the British empire at large; so that a kind of metaphysical \nmagnificence hovers over the scene, and supplies what may be literally \nwanting.19  \nIn a few of Coburn\u201fs photographs, and in James\u201fs occasional, quite \nstartling statements, such as the one above, it is the invisible totality, alone, that \nfinally makes sense of the contingent details. For all his growing assurance as a \nwriter, apparent in his subtle shifts of time and place and a facility with telling \nphrases to sum up a city, James\u201fs search for mastery over the city leads him to \nopt, first, for a conventional, topical source of meaning for citizens of London in \nthe late nineteenth-century -- \u201ethe British empire at large\u201f \u2013 before, then, settling \nfor the compensations of a \u201emetaphysical magnificence\u201f. In Coburn\u201fs case, \nphotography offers a quite specific resistance to the metaphysics that, if anything, \nhe embraced more whole-heartedly than James. After the ability to record detail, \nthe second defining characteristic of photography is that a photograph signifies \nthe moment in which an image was captured, and the invisible point of view of \nthe photographer. In Parliament from the River (c. 1906) Coburn leaves the point \nof view from the muddy edge of the river in The Dome of St. Paul\u2019s, and assumes \na position behind the oarsman, as he, on his barge mid-stream, occupying the \nforeground and in focus, looks across the bow at the locus of political power and \nauthority embodied in buildings. Mistiness, here, signifies, in some measure, the \ninaccessibility of power that is nevertheless present and inescapable. In spite of \n 12 \nthe distance across the river, Coburn\u201fs lens captures the gothic architecture of \nParliament, thereby evoking religion, less to subsume politics into a greater \nventure and more to suggest a sustaining alliance between church and state. The \nsame alliance is present in Westminster Abbey (1905), taken from the street \ncorner of Victoria Embankment and Westminster Bridge, looking over \nParliament\u201fs Old Palace Yard to St. Margaret\u201fs Church, and then the Abbey.20 \nCoburn\u201fs London was published in two editions within a few years of \neach other. They have quite different introductory essays that bear upon the \nquestions of how the sheer \u201ethereness\u201f of objects and people in a photograph can \nbe assimilated into the desired aesthetic whole; and how, in James\u201fs terminology, \n\u201etype\u201f and \u201especimen\u201f may relate to each other. The text of London: A Book of \nAspects (1909) by the Symbolist poet and critic, Arthur Symons, became the \nIntroduction to the very limited edition of London (1914). It is a piece of literary \nImpressionism, full of images of London that accord with the aspects of the city \nfavoured by Coburn and James. Thus: \nIf the Thames is the soul of London, and if the parks are its eyes, surely \nTrafalgar Square may be reckoned its heart. There is no hour of day or \nnight when it is not admirable, but for my part I prefer the evening, just \nas it grows dusk, after a day of heavy rain.21 \nThroughout, Symons is more comfortable with the symbolic potential of London\u201fs \nstreets than with the details, which perturb him greatly. Yet his backward-looking \noverview, when read alongside Coburn\u201fs photographs, credits the totality, \nwhether imagined as a body or as a metaphysical entity, with more authority \nthan can be justified when the mimetic detail of the photographs, as well as their \nformal points of view, are contextualised historically. For Hilaire Belloc, in the \nrival Introduction to Coburn\u201fs London (1909): \nThe prime element in the structure of the town from its very beginnings \nhas been its combination of commercial port and national capital. \u2026 \n 13 \nLondon, in a word, was in every way called to be a meeting-place, and \nespecially a meeting place of commerce.22  \nUnderstandably, Coburn was amazed that his photographs were apparently \nignored, especially as Belloc apparently thought highly of them. Still, we can take \nBelloc\u201fs concern with trade, politics, religion, and class, and specifically with the \nsystemic, circulatory aspect of London\u201fs trade associated with the river, as \nencouraging a fresh look at Coburn\u201fs photographs. Circulation extends far beyond \nthe Thames, however. \nIII \nIn the \u201ePreface\u201f to In the Cage James risks the symbolic aesthetic that he had set \nout in \u201eLondon\u201f along a narrative line; that is to say, having subtly associated \naesthetics and metaphysics in his writings about cities, almost presenting them \nas spaces for the refinement of a style, he confidently descends the social scale \nand enters a mundane world, one of shabby respectability as characters come to \npopulate his narrative: \nThe postal-telegraph office in general, and above all the small local office \nof one\u201fs immediate neighbourhood, scene of the transaction of so much of \none\u201fs daily business, haunt of one\u201fs needs and one\u201fs duties \u2026 had ever \nhad, to my sense, so much of London to give out, so much of its huge \nperpetual story to tell, that any momentary wait there seemed to take \nplace in a strong social draught, the stiffest breeze of the human \ncomedy.23 \nJames was far from metaphysical in his instructions to Coburn, dispatching him \nto a specific, if generic and nondescript, London sight, one with some interesting \nramifications: \nThere will be then another thing that I haven\u201ft mentioned, for \u201eIn the \nCage\u201f: a London corner, if possible, with a grocer\u201fs shop containing a \npostal-telegraph office. \u2026 Look for grocer\u201fs shops with post-offices \ninside.24 \n 14 \nJames\u201fs reliance on letters and telegrams would have made him \nbroadly aware of the status of the General Post Office, if not necessarily aware \nthat an 1867 Act of Parliament had given it almost a monopoly over \ncommunications. Importantly, he positions his telegraphist at the nexus of \ncommerce and communications in Cocker\u201fs: \nThis transparent screen fenced out or fenced in, according to the side of \nthe narrow counter on which the human lot was cast, the duskiest corner \nof a shop pervaded \u2026 at all times by the presence of hams, cheese, dried \nfish, soap, varnish, paraffin, and other solids and fluids that she came to \nknow perfectly by their smells without consenting to know them by their \nnames. \nThe telegraphist, as a \u201epublic servant\u201f, however, \u201eobscure\u201f, perceives herself to be \nabove Mr Mudge, her former colleague and fianc\u00e9, whose unwavering and, finally, \nfulfilled, expectation that he will marry her is founded on his own narrative. In \ndescending the social ladder by transferring from the Mayfair post-office\/grocer\u201fs \nshop to the \u201emuch lower neighbourhood\u201f of Chalk Farm, he moves up the \neconomic ladder by his promotion \u201eto a more commanding position\u201f, and because \nhis interest is decidedly on the commercial side of the \u201etransparent screen\u201f that, \nfrom his point of view, fences in the public servant.25 Mr Mudge, at least, savours \nthe names of the commodities, and, we can reasonably assume, their \ndifferentiating brand-names, as well. Whatever else it is, In the Cage is a story of \ncommodities, a point that is underlined by the absence of people and even of a \ndoor to the shop in Coburn\u201fs photograph. \n 15 \n \nFigure 2: Alvin Langdon Coburn, The Cage, frontispiece to In the Cage, The \nNovels and Tales of Henry James, XI, Book Collection, Harry Ransom Humanities \nResearch Center, The University of Texas at Austin. \n \nAmong Coburn\u201fs photographs of cities, the frontispiece of the volume \nof The New York Edition containing In the Cage is unusual in its archival detail, \nand for the kind of clarity that his pictorialist techniques of the time \u201ebrushed\u201f \naside, much as Impressionist painters had been doing for three decades. The \nCage (c. 1906), as it is captioned (see figure 2) reveals the interconnections of \nclass, trade and the city, as mediated through the postal service. These \ninterconnections, it can be argued, constituted London, not through synechdochal \nrelations between part and whole, but through a structural logic of exchange. \nThis logic is revealed in Coburn\u201fs photograph of commodities in a shop window, \nand also through Joseph Pennell\u201fs images of London\u201fs transportation. The order \n 16 \nof priority in Coburn\u201fs photograph is a matter of point of view. The photograph \ntakes in only the capitalized, engraved words, \u201ePost Office\u201f, along the top of the \nshop-front, and, therefore, it is not apparent whether there is more shop signage, \naround the corner, devoted to the grocery business. A rectangular white sign \ndetails the Post Office\u201fs services, including \u201eParcel Post Telegraph\u201f and a savings \nbank facility, while the post-box itself, set into the wall of the shop, and \noccupying one of the four visible window spaces, supports the Post Office\u201fs \nprecedence. However, the other three window spaces are insistently commercial, \nencouraging spending rather than saving. In the top two windows, there are \nposters advertising the cost of sugar and coffee. In the bottom-right window, are \ncontainers for tea, sweets and other goods. Commodities are also depicted in the \nother, more up-market, London shop-window photographed by Coburn, under \nJames\u201fs guidance, as the frontispiece for The Golden Bowl, though the paintings \nand antique plates in The Curiosity Shop lack prices, and the display is more \nmuted. \nOstensibly, the post-office function drives James\u201fs narrative, and \nmoves the telegraphist beyond the daily routine of the shop and into the wider \ncity. As she discerns the intricacies of the aristocratic affair at the centre of the \nplot, reference points in the city become less tangible, pronouns multiply and \nnarrative turns back on, and around, itself before, indeterminately, proceeding. It \nbecomes more and more of a \u201elate\u201f tale by Henry James, in which the layers of \nself-consciousness leave a margin, from which \u201ea London corner\u201f may reveal \u201eso \nmuch of London \u2026 so much of its huge perpetual story\u201f. But this is a story in \nwhich epistemological ambiguities are more embedded in the changing dynamic \nof London\u201fs economic and social world than its style and narrative structure \nmight suggest. This dynamic is visually set out in Coburn\u201fs photograph, but with \nmuch greater emphasis on commodity fetishism than in James, for all his efforts \nto be contemporary. In the \u201egrocer\u201fs shop containing a postal-telegraph office\u201f, \ntrade has an eye for the main chance, as the self-made man, Mr Mudge, \n 17 \nrecognises. \u201eThe exuberance of the aristocracy was the advantage of trade\u201f, he \nobserves, \u201eand everything was knit together in a richness of pattern that it was \ngood to follow with one\u201fs finger-tips\u201f. \u201eThe more flirtations\u201f [within the aristocracy \nand conducted through the postal service], \u201ethe more cheese and pickles\u201f.26 \nFor all the plot\u201fs attention to aristocratic indiscretions and the \ntelegraphist\u201fs role, the established social and economic power structure is hardly \nimmune to trade, and, arguably, this proves to be a greater drama. Much the \nsame may be said of the barrier between the public and commercial spheres, as \nmanifested by the interior disposition of Cocker\u201fs, and the spatial organisation of \nthe window that Coburn photographed. The photograph appears to be quite \nrigidly structured around horizontal and vertical bands, including the almost \nabstract foreground. Yet this mini-archive of consumption points to an invisible \nlogic of exchange that mixes things up, not least the separation between \nappearance and reality. In the top two of the four windows, the sugar and coffee \nadvertising posters have been pasted over what appear to be more permanent \nwindow signs, this superimposition signalling a need for speedier communication \nwith potential customers in order to maximize sales. That the top left corners of \nboth posters are turning down anticipates the next advertisement. The items in \nthe bottom right window are also presumably inter-changeable. In the Cage and \nThe Cage are of the same world that Thorstein Veblen describes in The Theory of \nthe Leisure Class (1899), one in which a production economy is distorted by \nexchange-value. The proliferating mediations -- in James\u201fs words, \u201eneeds\u201f, \n\u201eduties\u201f, \u201elabours\u201f, \u201erewards\u201f and \u201edisappointments\u201f -- are all given economic value \nin the \u201emysterious character of the commodity-form\u201f, as Marx puts it.27 For Mr \nMudge, these mediations are not mere illusions. They connect aristocratic affairs \nwith grocery sales, and, in-glorious as they sound, are very much a part of \u201ethat \ndeepest abyss of all the wonderments that break out for the student of great \ncities\u201f. Importantly, class and trade, society and economy, are put into \n 18 \nrelationships by the public postal network, a system that crosses the city\u201fs limits \nbut also the nation\u201fs. \nThe global reach of the commercial world is most prominently \nrepresented in Coburn\u201fs frontispiece photograph by a sign for Mazawattee Tea \npainted onto, rather than engraved into, the glass of the bottom right window. \nThere is a typicality about this detail of a brand that is of a different, more lowly \nkind, than applies to James\u201fs \u201eSpecimens\u201f, which evoke \u201eTypes\u201f. Nevertheless, a \nbrand name resonates, too, as Alan Davies reports: \nMost of Densham & Sons business was now selling tea in bulk to local \ngrocers, which was then blended by the grocer for the retail trade. \u2026 It \nwas John Lane Densham who was instrumental in persuading his brothers \nthat the company needed a romantic and eye-catching name and, after a \nday spent in the Guildhall library, chose the name Mazawattee.28 \nThe brand-name was registered in 1887, and derived, according to Davies, from \n\u201emazathe\u201f, Hindi for luscious, being combined with \u201ewattee\u201f, Ceylonese for garden, \nto create an exotic image for an urban market. London was the capital of trade, \nand the company was vigorous in its brand-differentiation through the 1890s. It \nis not surprising, then, to find an advertisement for Mazawattee Tea in Coburn\u201fs \nshop window, though, by the time of his photograph, the price of tea had risen to \ninclude higher taxes to cover the heavy cost of the Boer War (1899\u20131902). Thus, \nthe exchange between London and Ceylon, passing through the East India Docks, \nwhich provoke in James, in \u201eLondon at Midsummer\u201f, the \u201eimaginative thrill\u201f of \nEmpire, was being diverted to assist in reparations and the post-war re-\nstructuring in South Africa.29 The significance of this detail in Coburn\u201fs \nphotograph expands, but not because the part symbolises a harmonious totality. \nPart meets whole through the evocation of trade routes between far-flung parts \nof the Empire and London. When rejecting the \u201eminiature cameras\u201f of the Kodak \nera, Coburn stated \u201eI like to compose my pictures to the edge\u201f30. Here, Coburn\u201fs \nphotograph follows trade lines to the edge. \n 19 \nAn observation, by Stanley Cavell in The World Viewed: Reflections on \nthe Ontology of Film, calls up the third defining aspect of photography as a \nmedium, beyond that of the recording of details and of the moment in which, and \nthe location from which, a photograph was taken: \nWhat happens in a photograph is that it comes to an end. A photograph is \ncropped, not necessarily by a paper cutter or by masking but by the \ncamera itself. \u2026 The camera, being finite, crops a portion from an \nindefinitely larger field. \u2026 When a photograph is cropped, the rest of the \nworld is cut out. The implied presence of the rest of the world, and its \nexplicit rejection, are as essential in the experience of a photograph as \nwhat it explicitly presents.31 \nA photograph sharpens the sense of a threshold, which, as it encloses a scene, in \nthe case of Coburn\u201fs The Cage, discloses a wider world, one to which even Mr \nMudge is connected, in his grocer\u201fs career in an obscure northern part of the city.  \nDetails and lines in a photograph are never that alone, because comprehension \nof an image within its own frame cannot fully equate to comprehensiveness of \nknowledge. \nDetails make sense in their signifying relationships. Beyond the edge \nof a photograph, lines imply direction or extension, including the lattice-work of \nlines in the foreground and the indistinct ones in the background in Wapping. \nThese lines in Coburn\u201fs city photographs advise us that bridges, machinery, \nbuildings, streets, rivers, and \u2013 most inclusively, if least dramatically \u2013 \ncommodities can only ever be partially meaningful in themselves, and need \u201ethe \nrest of the world\u201f. Labour in distant parts of the empire is needed to produce tea, \nand labour is needed in the centre of the empire to retail it. Probably the most \nwell-known evocation of the trading lines of Empire is in Heart of Darkness (1902) \nby Joseph Conrad, whom Coburn photographed in 1916, for More Men of Mark \n(1922), as he had photographed James in 1905 for Men of Mark (1913). The \nstory begins on the lower reaches of the Thames, \u201elike the beginning of an \n 20 \ninterminable waterway\u201f, linking, Conrad continues, \u201ethe biggest, and the greatest, \ntown on earth\u201f to, in James\u201fs words \u201ethe wealth and power of the British empire \nat large\u201f.32 This context supplies a compelling meaning to the misty outlines of \nwarehouses and the abstracted parts of river-side machinery that otherwise \nflatten Coburn\u201fs images. It is not that reality, in Coburn\u201fs photographs, is illusory, \nor even inverted, as Marx polemically has it in his famous camera obscura \nanalogy in The German Ideology (1845-47). If the meaning is less than clear, \nthen, like the commodities in the post-office\/grocery window, this is, in \u00c9tienne \nBalibar\u201fs explication of Marx, \u201ethe way in which reality (a certain form or social \nstructure) cannot but appear\u201f.33 \nIV \nIn contrast to the close collaboration that he developed with Coburn, James \nseemed little bothered by what Joseph Pennell would visually add to \u201eLondon\u201f \nwhen it was published in The Century Magazine in 1888. He invited Pennell to \n\u201efollow your own fancy. \u2026 do your own London, and it will be sufficiently mine\u201f.34 \nYet, with all but two of the drawings devoted to scenes of travel by rail, road and \nriver to, from and across the metropolis, Pennell, in a different visual medium \nfrom Coburn, also speculates on the idea of a threshold to the city, and the \nextent to which London may be picturable in all its relations.\n \n 21 \nFigure 3: Joseph Pennell, Charing Cross Station, from Henry James, \u201eLondon\u201f, \nThe Century Magazine, 37 (December 1888). \n \nPennell\u201fs first drawing is of Charing Cross Station (see figure 3), not \nEuston, where James had arrived in 1869, and is almost exaggeratedly oriented \ntowards themes of arrival and departure, and people on the move. Pennell\u201fs bid \nfor pictorial unity is at the other end of the spectrum from Coburn\u201fs and James\u201fs \nModernist strategies. One-point perspective straightforwardly connects \nforeground and background, whereas Coburn\u201fs pictorial inclinations seek to \nflatten such coordinates. And, as we have remarked, James\u201fs peregrinations and \nconstant qualifications of his own narrative of arrival in London (having already \narrived, as it were), subject narrative to the irony that becomes possible when a \nsecure citizen of the city views his earlier, arriving self.  Pennell adopts a less \nsubtle approach.  From a position at the same height as the skyline, which is \ndimly visible through the awning of the Charing Cross train shed, perspective is \nenforced by the receding platforms and tracks, the latter occupied by arriving \nand departing trains, with passengers streaming through the ticket barrier on to \nthe platform, under a sign: \u201eTo the Continental Main Line [and] North Kent Loop \nLine Train\u201f. However, as in other drawings for \u201eLondon\u201f, such as Bow Bells, \nCheapside, Piccadilly and In the Underground, pictorial unity, sought through use \nof traditional perspective, is combined with a decided anecdotal quality.35 \nTravelers of different class and gender are picked out and take on character, \nmuch as the letters on the platform sign are self-consciously drawn and, uneven \nand irregular, are individualized. Potential stories are inaugurated by men\u201fs hats: \nfrom top hats, sometimes matched by morning dress and usually paired with a \nwalking stick as accessory, through trilby- and bowler-hats, to the cap of the \nticket-inspector at the barrier. Newspapers, in the hands of men, wearing a \nrange of hats, suggest the public context of other stories, and a differentiation of \nnews according to class interest.  \n 22 \nThe details of travellers on the concourse in Charing Cross Station \n(1888) or of pedestrians, carriage-born citizens and those struggling with \nbarrows depicted in Bow Bells, Cheapside do not coalesce, as they do in Pennell\u201fs \nlater more Modernist etchings. By 1905 and the reprinting of \u201eLondon\u201f in English \nHours, Pennell had fully adopted an Impressionistic style and his entirely new set \nof drawings were part of a reaction to the clarity of detail that photographic \ntechnology could deliver. Yet, the localised discrimination possible in drawing and \nits associated technologies is a reason to hesitate in the face of visual \nModernism\u201fs tempting offer of pictorial unity. For the frontispieces to the New \nYork Edition, James asked Coburn to omit people, and while there are a few, the \napproach is far removed from the anecdotal. \nIt could have been London\u201fs lack of a surrounding city wall, such as \nJames was pleased to encounter in Chester, which he visited in 1869, that led \nhim to describe the approaching \u201egeneral immensity\u201f of London as a network: \n\u201ethe miles of housetops and viaducts, the complication of junctions and signals \nthrough which we made our way to the station\u201f. While not troubled by \nmetaphysical presences and absences, Pennell\u201fs drawings share with James\u201fs \nwritings an awareness that places of arrival are also places of departure; and \nwith that awareness, comes an interest in what London\u201fs identity might be, as \nthe city of meetings and transactions (what James calls \u201eour reciprocities and \nactivities\u201f) and of physical journeys and communications.36 Pennell contributes \ninsights into the infrastructure of London as a crossroads, one that faces the rest \nof the nation, including, to the north-west Liverpool and, from there, the Atlantic \nworld, and, to the south, the Continent and the Empire beyond. To be at Charing \nCross, in Pennell\u201fs drawing, is to register a curious form of motion: headed for \nsomewhere else, propelled by an exaggerated one-point visual perspective; \ndistracted by anecdotal detail; and at a threshold of somewhere different that is \nyet part of the same railway system. Pennell pursues this last conjunction of \nsameness and difference in his choice of succeeding images. A Cab Stand shows \n 23 \na road under Charing Cross Railway Station; that is, an intersection between rail \nand road travel. Somerset House, From Charing Cross takes us above the rail \nbridge, and depicts the tracks coming out of the station crossing, first, the horse-\ndrawn traffic on the Embankment and then the Thames, with a steamer moored \nalmost under the bridge. Other drawings are of barges moored at Limehouse and \nacross from the Tower of London at flood tide. \nWhen, early in 1912, Pennell had the opportunity to draw the Panama \nCanal under construction, he worried that he would get to Panama too late:  \u201ethe \nwork [would be] finished and \u2026 there would be nothing to see\u201f. He was \nfascinated by what could be seen, during construction projects, of the \ninfrastructure that, in the case of the Canal, would \u201ebe beneath the waters on one \nside and filled in with earth on the other\u201f. His drawings of the London \nUnderground, the great construction project in the years after 1884, when he \nmoved to the city, are not of the invisible workings, but of the appearance of \nwhat has been hidden, \u201efilled in with earth\u201f.37  \n \nFigure 4: Joseph Pennell, In the Underground Station, from Henry James, \n\u201eLondon\u201f, The Century Magazine, 37 (December 1888). \n 24 \nIn the Underground Station (1888) (see figure 4) is the third drawing in \n\u201eLondon\u201f, and follows on from Charing Cross Station and A Cab Stand. Pennell \nshows passengers on two facing platforms of a station on the Inner Circle Line, \nas the modern-day Circle Line was known. Anecdote, again, distracts attention \naway from the tracks to \u201esociety\u201f, meeting on the spacious platforms. The \nlocation is of more interest in this case, though. The station name is \nindeterminately reproduced as a sign over the tracks, to the extent that while the \nletters designate that it is probably Paddington underground station, there is \nenough of an overlap between the ten letters to suggest an amalgam of \n\u201eFarringdon\u201f and \u201ePaddington\u201f. \n \nFigure 5: Anon., Railway Plan of London and its Suburbs (1889), from Clive \nBillson, A History of the London Tube Maps, http:\/\/holopaw.me.uk (last viewed \n7th June, 2009). \n 25 \nThe stretch of line between these stations, dating from the opening \nceremony on 9th January, 1863, is the oldest in what became the Underground. \nIn 1888 it was the busiest stretch of line, with approaching five hundred trains \nper day. Moreover, at both Paddington and Farringdon there were intersections \nwith the over-ground rail system. The Great Western, and then the Great \nNorthern, ran trains into Paddington and then on through to Farringdon, and, in \nso doing, projected a notion of structure as network (see figure 5). When the \nInner Circle Line was completed it created an inner network within the national \nnetwork, rather than being, in Christian Wolmar\u201fs view, \u201elittle more than an \nunderground tunnel below London which happened to serve several local \nstations\u201f.38 Using the Inner Circle as a point of comparison for the roadway laid \nout as part of John Nash\u201fs adjoining Regent\u201fs Park, Arthur Symons misses the \npoint. \u201eAnd there is the perplexing inner circle\u201f, he grumbles, \u201ewhich is as difficult \nto get in or out of as its lamentable namesake underground\u201f.39 The point is that \nin economic as well as structural terms, the Inner Circle Line envisages a \nfunctional logic of circulation, rather than a totality, an insight that became \ninstitutionalised in 1931, when Harry Beck\u201fs structural map gained favour over \ngeographical maps of London Underground. In funding terms, too, the private \nsector built the lines, and then the Metropolitan and District companies had to \nconstruct the operating system -- in effect, the managing of time and space -- \nwithout any central transport authority, though Farringdon and Paddington were \nboth promoted as potential head-quarters. This paradoxical notion of an \nidentifiable, named entity which yet had permeable boundaries, and which could, \nsomehow, be represented, applies equally to the metropolis as to the \n\u201eUnderground\u201f. Thus, Farringdon and Paddington exemplified, for Pennell, the \nbusy intersection that, on a vast scale, made up London, which, in turn, was \ninextricably connected with somewhere else. Appropriately, to the east, the Inner \nCircle Line served the City of London which was at the financial centre of an \n 26 \nempire. These are common enough insights now but were hard-earned in the \nlate nineteenth-century. \nDuring this period in his career, when he felt less challenged by \nphotography\u201fs ability to reproduce details, Pennell exploited drawing\u201fs ability to \ncapture a dramatic but peculiar form of urban content, namely physical signs that, \nby definition, signified something else. In Sunset in Oxford Street the skyline of \nfive-storey buildings and church steeples is over-topped by a large sign on a \nframework of posts. The words are indistinct, as they are in Piccadilly and Bow \nBells, Cheapside, where men are converted into portable signs by the billboards \nthey carry. It is possible to make out, on one of the billboards in each drawing, \nthe word \u201eLondon\u201f, and Pennell jokingly qualifies and personalises the city-\ndesignation in Bow Bells, Cheapside as \u201ePennell London 1888\u201f. With that \nexception, the proliferation of signs and the instances of clocks in a number of \nthe drawings, signify an impersonal city, one in which people are unknown to \neach other and must, therefore, be informed, directed and encouraged to buy \ngoods and services. The station walls in In the Underground Station (see figure 4) \nare covered with signs, a mixture of directional or informational signs and \nadvertising. The easiest one to make out is above the station\u201fs less-than-distinct \nname, and advertises \u201eWilson Barrett\u201f. He was an actor, playwright and theatre \nmanager whose career had a late revival with a few successful melodramas on \nthe London stage in the 1880s. All of the Underground companies maximised the \nopportunity to advertise their own services, but, also, the services, \nentertainments and products to which their tracks gave easier access. Shops and \ntheatres, in return, consistently mentioned the proximity of an Underground \nstation in the advertisements they took out in newspapers, thereby helping to \ncreate a circuit of signs that brought together transportation and trade, each with \nits sub-systems of communication.  \nIn The Philosophy of Marx \u00c9tienne Balibar defends the mere \nappearances of social life against metaphysics, whether of the transcendental or \n 27 \nmaterialist kind, and explains why even the superficial detail of a brand name, \nshould not be overlooked: \nNow fetishism is not a subjective phenomenon or a false perception of \nreality, as an optical illusion or a superstitious belief would be. It \nconstitutes, rather, the way in which reality (a certain form or social \nstructure) cannot but appear. \u2026 To suppress the appearance would be to \nabolish social relations.40 \nIt is precisely the point about capital that it does not have a reliable image, but \nthat its pre-eminent site, the city, is full of prosaic signs, promising, advising, \ninforming, and commanding. Malcolm Bull, in Seeing Things Hidden: Apocalypse, \nVision and Totality, maintains that the period of modernity could, at most, witness \n\u201ethe coming into hiding\u201f of the unknown, as divergent elements in cities (classes, \nethnic and racial groupings, religion, and trade) came to occupy the same space in \ntime, and as it became more apparent in whose interest it was that capital should \nlack a clear representation.41  \nCoburn, James and, of the three of them, certainly Pennell did not \nsubscribe to radical or reforming traditions in art or literature that sought to \nreveal economic and social fault-lines running through the city, upsetting, at \nsome remove, versions of pictorial unity. Yet, we can interpret some of Coburn\u201fs \nphotographs, however opaque, as displacing the image of capital and its \ninstitutions into the incidental and marginal but still just-about-visible details of a \nshop window, Thames-side machinery, and a muddy river bank. Similarly, \nPennell\u201fs anecdotes and seemingly inconsequential, merely illustrative, interest in \nsigns and in transportation networks interrupt any smooth passage from detail to \ntotality. While, for his part, James\u201fs elaborate approach to a point of view in \n\u201eLondon\u201f, and his efforts, in some of his Prefaces to the London novels and stories  \nas well as, more prosaically, in his instructions to Coburn, to reserve a margin for \nhimself, reveal, in passing, how difficult it is to escape the complexity and \nindeterminacy of social relations in a great city. This was an insight James was \n 28 \nhappy to appropriate for his poetics in a less materialistic sense. But it is only by \nan inverted, and typically Modernist, understanding of alienation, allied to a \ndubious rhetorical play on use-value in the midst of the growing commodification \nof the telegraphist\u201fs world in In the Cage, that James can keep his distance: \nAdmirable thus [the working class\u201fs] economic instinct; it is curious of \nnothing that it hasn\u201ft vital use for \u2026 but somehow, after all, it gives no \npause to the \u201eartist\u201f, to the morbid imagination. That rash, that idle faculty \ncontinues to abound in questions, and to supply answers to as many of \nthem as possible; all of which makes a great occupation for idleness.42 \nWriting about another capital city, Prague, Jacques Derrida glosses \nsome of the issues worked through in this essay. Quickly disposing of the \nhistorical definition of a city\u201fs limit -- \u201ea gate, walls, an administrative border\u201f and \nso on -- he enquires, \u201eIs it enough to speak of the threshold to speak of the \nidentity of a city?\u201f His part-answer, that \u201ea city must remain open to knowing that \nit does not yet know what it will be\u201f, catches a sense of London in Coburn, James \nand Pennell, in spite of their stated models of representation.43 Their London was \nalready facing up to the invisible communication systems and impersonal \nmarkets that would stretch and confuse any category of identity. Confident \nenough to entitle, between them, two books and a few essays with the name of \nthe city, and to write and illustrate many more, in their efforts to describe, \nnarrate or picture London, they became entangled with larger forces or, in \nnineteenth-century language, laws. \u201eAs the great city makes everything\u201f, James \ncasually remarks of London, in a comment that bears upon his own medium but \nmore materially on the visual conditions for Coburn and Pennell, \u201eit makes its \nown system of weather and its own optical laws\u201f.44 When these three city-\nwatchers are alongside each other, whether in formal collaborations or not, the \nover-riding impression is of varying degrees of artistic authority bumping up \nagainst \u201eLondon [which] is only part of something else\u201f, in E. M. Forster\u201fs words, \nand \u201eLondon \u2026 a strange thing\u201f, in Engels\u201fs. In seeking to name the larger totality \n 29 \nand to fill the void, James turns to a rhetoric of excess. His memorable phrases \nmay be put together with the seemingly incidental details that cannot be \noverlooked in some entrancing photographs by Coburn, and also with Pennell\u201fs \neye for detail and choice of locations that are, at once, inside the city and a part \nof what is outside its boundaries. Together, they constitute some of the most \nrevealing representations of the hidden, but not unknowable, forces that make \nand re-make a city. \n                                           \n1 I should like to acknowledge the support of the Arts and Humanities Research \nCouncil.
