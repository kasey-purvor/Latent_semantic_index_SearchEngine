Malliaris \nInstitute of Psychiatry, \nKing\u2019s College London \ny.malliaris @ iop.kcl.ac.uk \n \n \n \nAbstract \n \nThis paper introduces an encapsulated sensor node \nthat is devised to monitor and record motion patterns \nover long, quotidian periods of time with potential \napplication in psychological studies. Its design fuses \ndifferent sensing modalities to allow efficient capturing \nof tilt and acceleration stimuli, as well as embedded \nalgorithms that abstract from the raw sensory data to \nindicative features. By combining tilt switches and \naccelerometers with customized processing techniques, \nit is argued that a power-efficient yet information-rich \napproach is reached for the observation and logging of \nhuman motion-based activity. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nMany believe that posture and motion patterns of \nthe human body are key indicators for a person\u2019s \nemotional state and wellbeing [1]. Capturing the \ngestures and pose of dancers, actors, and more recently \nalso patients, is receiving an increasingly amount of \nattention in the research community. \nCommon approaches that are currently applied in \nmotion capture involve tags and external sensors (such \nas video cameras [2] or ultrasound receivers), or highly \naccurate body suits [3] measuring rotation and \nacceleration. It is, with today\u2019s technology, costly and \nintrusive to capture all aspects of body motion and \npose throughout the day, in unpredictable \nenvironments and situations, with these traditional \nmethods. \nThe sensor node that is described in this paper \nprovides data that is accurate enough to tell what type \nof activities the wearer has been doing, but not as fine-\ngrained a\u2019nd detailed as commercially available motion \ncapture suits. The presented approach revolves around \nthe abstraction of sensory data in the sensor module \nitself, and a dynamic switching of the most appropriate \ninput modality.  \n2. Overview \n \nThe research that has led to this paper includes both \nhardware and algorithm decisions which are closely \ntied together: The algorithms do not just output pre-\nprocessed sensory data, but also control which sensors \nto activate, and at which speed the micro-controller \nshould operate.  \nA diagram of the presented approach is given below \nin Figure 1 as an overview of the paper \u2013 justification \nand a more detailed explanation will follow from the \nnext section onwards. The output of the sensor node \nvaries with the mode it is in: the node remains silent in \nsleep mode, a three-dimensional orientation (pose) is \ngiven in tilt mode, and characteristic pose and peak \ndescriptions are produced in acceleration mode. \nFigure 1. Diagram of the three possible states of \nthe sensor node (boxes), conditions for transition \nbetween them (edges), and output types (clouds). \n \nThe sensor node is foremost designed to provide a \nlow-energy method for sensing motion and posture of \nthe body it is attached to. As in many low-power \ndesigns, this need for preserving as much energy as \npossible has affected the choice of algorithms and \nindividual hardware components (in particular \nmicrocontroller and sensors). In this case, it has also \npropagated to the data analysis, exploiting the fact that \nhuman motion patterns do not always contain gestures. \ntilt switch \n no change no peaks \nhamming > threshold \nSleep Tilt \nZzzz..

Application \n \nDespite many advances in the genetics of \npsychiatric diseases [4], there is still no single \nlaboratory test for the diagnosis of any psychiatric \n\u201cdisease\u201d, unlike other areas of medicine. Diagnosis \nand therapy monitoring rely on self-report measures, \nsemi-structured interviews, and careful observation of \na patient\u2019s behaviour. Given the \u201cbehavioural\u201d nature \nof these disorders, the \u201cstatus-quo\u201d of psychiatric \nassessment is unlikely to change any time soon. This is \nwhere the promise of activity sensors presented in this \npaper lies. \nMood disorders make a fine example. For instance, \na depressive episode is characterised by major changes \nin mood, cognition and behaviour (see DSM-IV-TR1 \nfor major diagnostic criteria). Although activity \nsensing may never be able to tap in a patient\u2019s feelings \nor suicidal thoughts (but see Picard\u2019s work for \nemerging solutions to this, [5]), it can easily monitor \nchanges in psychomotor activity. Anergic and agitated \nstates as well as disturbances in sleep, are not only \nhighly distressing symptoms of mood disorders in the \npatients themselves, but they are also core symptoms \nthat have high predictive value for further relapses in \nremitted patients [6].  \nIndeed, there is some emerging work in the \napplication of activity sensors (Actigraphy) in \npsychiatry ([7], [8]). However, research so far has \nrelied on commercial off-the-shelf single sensor \naccelerometers with limited recognition capabilities \n(such as the Actiwatch and the Motionlogger, [9]). The \ncommercial cost of such devices (\u00a3400-\u00a3800) has \nthwarted further research development, and the \napplication of such work remains restricted in the \nrealms of well-funded research projects rather than real \nlife clinical practice. \nAlthough the low-cost and expandability of the \npresented activity sensors are major advantages for \nmany applications in psychiatry, there are also \nimportant theoretical benefits. From a theoretical point \nof view, psychiatric disorders provide a good pool of \nextreme behavioural and emotional states (such as \nvegetative depressed and highly activated manic states, \nrigid rituals of OCD and Autistic patients and so forth). \nSuch extreme states probably represent easier targets \nfor recognition by quantitative models used in the \ncurrent sensor network than \u201cnormal\u201d behaviours and \nemotions found in healthy populations.  \nThe challenge lies in the successful collaboration \nbetween the two fields (computer scientists \/ engineers   \n                                                           \n1http:\/\/www.behavenet.com\/capsules\/disorders\/dsm4TRclass\nification.htm \nand clinical psychologists \/ psychiatrists). And also in \nthe development of quantitative models, informed by \nactivity sensors, which will successfully characterise \nand distinguish between different illness states and \ndisorders.  \n \n4. Hardware Description \n \nThe biggest challenges in engineering such a body-\nworn activity sensor node are (1) keeping its power \nconsumption down and (2) keeping its form-factor \nunobtrusive to wear comfortably. In order to be able to \nlog activity data over long periods of time, the sensor \nnode is built to switch between two sensing modes: a \nrough pose-measuring mode and a more accurate \nacceleration sensing mode. A third mode powers the \nnode down for periods of no activity. \nThe first type of sensor present in the sensor node is \nthe tilt switch: the combination of 9 tilt switches \npositioned at 45 degree angles from each other cover a \nvery crude sense of tilt for the board in three planes (as \nillustrated in Figure 2 left). The easiest way to visualise \nhow this works, is in one plane (Figure 2 right); the \nother two orthogonal planes work the same, only 9 \ninstead of 12 switches are required since we have \ncommon tilt switches between the three planes. \nThe accelerometer (Analog Devices ADXL202JE) \ncovers both acceleration and pose in two axes, but at a \nmore fine-grained resolution than the cluster of tilt \nswitches.  \nThere are two important reasons for incorporating \nthese sensors this way. Both are related to resources:  \nEnergy. The tilt switches require less power: with \nheavy pull-up resistors, they draw only a few \nmicroAmperes, compared to a few hundred for the \naccelerometer. \nProcessing. The tilt switches\u2019 output is binary, and \nthus easier and faster to process and store, especially \nwhen combining multiple switches. The \nmicrocontroller also does not need to run at a fast \nspeed for reading the switches' state, which results in \nan additional way to energy preservation. \n \nFigure 2. Left: The sensor node (25x25mm) with \naccelerometer (a) and tilt switches (t). Right: the \narrangement of the tilt switches allows for a \ncoarse orientation or pose measurement.  \n0000 1000 1100 1110 \n1111 0111 0011 0001 \nt \na \nThe microcontroller (PIC16F628A) has specifically \nbeen chosen because of its capability to change its \nprocessing speed. For the tilt switches, it runs at a low \n48kHz, while it needs to switch to 4 MHz for \nprocessing the accelerometer data. The microcontroller \ncan also go into a low-power sleep mode if no change \nis detected for a while in the datastreams of both \nswitches and accelerometers. \nThe speed at which any microcontroller runs affects \nits power consumption heavily (measured with a 3V \ncoin cell battery attached): In sleep mode, it consumes \nabout 200 nA. It can be woken up by the switches, in \nwhich case it changes to the 48kHz mode using \napproximately 20 uA. If motion patterns (peaks) are \ndetected, the accelerometer is activated and the \nmicrocontroller switches to 4Mhz for reading and \nprocessing, which requires about 1 mA. \nThis sensor board is designed to piggyback on a \nwireless body sensor network node (BSN node, \ndeveloped at Imperial College, with similar specs as \nthe Telos Mote), to which it is interfaced via RS232. It \ncontains capabilities for both logging the data locally \n(4Mbit, enough for logging 3 hours in worst case) and \nwirelessly distributing the data over a network. \n \n5. Algorithm Description \n \nThe switches\u2019 states are read at a speed of around \n200 Hertz; this information is not stored, but is instead \nprocessed into two values: one which describes the \nmost often occurring set of states during the last 200 \nmeasurements, and another value that reflects how \nmany switches have toggled during that period. The \nfirst is denoted the medoid, the second the cumulative \nhamming distance; the medoid occupies 9 bits, while \nthe cumulative hamming distance is assigned to 3 bits. \nThe accelerometer\u2019s two signals are read at \napproximately 50 Hertz; out of the raw sensory data, \nthe basic statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and \nvariance), and peak features (length, height, sign, and \narea) are calculated over a sliding window. These \nfeatures for the two acceleration sensors are stored in \n96 bits (6 bytes for basic statistics, 6 bytes for peak \nfeatures of the last peak). Figure 3 illustrates how new \nvalues cause the features to be recomputed. \nFor the calculation of average and variance, it \nsuffices to keep the sum of the past n elements (sum) \nand the sum of squares (sumsq) as the variance can be \ncalculated by (sumsq \u2013 (sum2\/n)). Note that the \ncomplete array needs to be transversed only when \nminima and maxima need to be re-calculated (when the \noutgoing element used to be minimum or maximum). \nOtherwise only the first and last values of the first-in-\nfirst-out array need to be examined. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Step-by-step example in which a sliding \nwindow (first-in-first-out array) of past acceleration \nvalues is used to compute the necessary \nvariables for basic statistics and peak features. \n \nThe output of the activity sensor node is by default \na packet that contains both the tilt and acceleration \ninformation (15 bytes in total, including a 1-byte pre-\namble). After a long period of inactivity (defined by \nthe lack of significant peaks), the device will switch to \noutput from just the tilt switches (3 bytes in total, \nincluding pre-amble). If this pose state remains the \nsame for a long period, the device will finally go into a \npower-saving \u201csleep\u201d mode. \nThe sleep mode can only be interrupted by activity \non the tilt switches, in which case it will operate with \ntilt switch output only. The cumulative hamming \ndistance measure is then used as a way to spot \naccelerometer-based activity: if a threshold is reached, \nthe device goes into a mode that outputs the full tilt- \nand acceleration information. These modes thus allow \na reduction in power consumption and data storage. \n6. Long-Term Activity Monitoring  \n \nThe motivation for this work lies in the recording of \nlong-term activity patterns. In this aim, the challenge is \nto find an optimal position in the trade-off between \nconserving as much of the activity information as \npossible (but requiring much storage and energy) and \ndoing the implementation with limited resources (but \nthrowing away potentially useful data). \nTo illustrate how much information is retained, \nFigure 4a plots the data produced by an activity sensor \nnode, attached to the ankle, while the wearer was \nwalking and climbing stairs. The current \nimplementation of the sensor board sends an output \npackage (if in sensing mode) up to five times per \nsecond to the BSN node, as opposed to the common 30 \nto 50 Hertz found in work such as [10]. This \nbandwidth has been experimentally established to \navoid missing significant peaks in the accelerometer \nsignals.  \nFigure 4b shows reconstructed peak patterns from \nthe features for both activities, showing promising \ndifferences that could be exploited by classification \nalgorithms to distinguish between the two activities. \nNote that both activities would be difficult to separate \nif just the basic statistics were used as features.  \nWhen the user remains motionless for a while, no \ndata is supposed to be recorded. The mechanical nature \nof the tilt switch, however, sometimes causes single tilt \nswitches to oscillate, thereby preventing the device to \ngo into sleep mode. In our preliminary experiments so \nfar, this has occurred only on a few occasions. \n \n \n   \n \nFigure 4. a) Example data of the wearer while \nwalking and climbing stairs, and b) graphical \nrepresentations of typical peak patterns using the \npeak height and length features. \n7. Conclusions and Future Work \n \nThis paper has focused on the design of the sensing \ncomponent for the recognition of valuable features in \nacceleration and tilt measurements. Special care has \nbeen given on integration of both sensing and feature \nprocessing, so that as much activity-related data is \nretained, using a minimal amount of storage capacity. \nWith the sensing hardware completed, the next \nsteps would be to implement storage and \ncommunication facilities on the BSN wireless node to \nstart integration toward long term testing.  \nThis work was partially sponsored by the UK\u2019s \nDTI-funded UbiCare centre (http:\/\/www.ubicare.org) \nand the MRC London\/Newcastle eMonitoring Trial \n(http:\/\/www.bipolarlab.com).
