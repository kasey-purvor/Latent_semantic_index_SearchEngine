The\nimpetus for such research probably results from a\nconvergence of conceptual and methodological\ninnovations, including an appreciation of the\nimportance of the social environment to health\nand greater accessibility of multilevel modelling\ntechniques and software. However, multilevel\ninvestigations of area effects on health abound\nwith conceptual and methodological challenges\nwhich have given rise to numerous debates.\nDebated issues are summarised in table 1.\nIn a previous review of social determinant\nstudies examining effects of area socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) on health, 23 of 25 studies reported\nsignificant associations between at least one\nmeasure of area SES and health, while controlling\nfor individual SES.1 The investigators concluded\nthat data supported the existence of modest small\narea effects on health but that extant data were\nreplete with methodological problems. More spe-\ncifically, they stated: \u2018\u2018It is clear from our review\nthat investigations of the role of neighbourhood\nlevel [small area] social factors on health are\ncharacteristics of preliminary, exploratory studies\nin epidemiology. Certain aspects of study design\nare in need of improvement before the field can\nadvance [\u2026] We hope that this review will show\nwhat has already been achieved and point the way\nto more sophisticated studies of societal determi-\nnants of health\u2019\u2019 (pp 120\u2013121).\nIn an effort to map out multilevel research on\nsocial determinants of health, to identify the types\nof evidence available, and to gauge whether or not\n\u2018\u2018more sophisticated studies\u2019\u2019 are being conducted,\nwe undertook a scoping study of research of area\neffects on health published between July 1998 and\nDecember 2005. Unlike the more familiar systema-\ntic review, a scoping study addresses broad\nresearch topics where many different study\ndesigns are applied, with the aim of comprehen-\nsively examining the extent, range, and nature of\nresearch activity and to identify key concepts and\nresults.36 37\nGiven the broad diversity of studies, we\nrestricted the scoping review to multilevel investi-\ngations of area effects on self rated health (SRH),\ncardiovascular disease and risk factors, and mor-\ntality among adults. These health indicators were\nselected because of their relevance to understand-\ning the broader socio-spatial patterning of health.\nSRH is a highly predictive measure of morbidity\nand mortality, independent of other medical,\nbehavioural, or psychosocial factors,38 and cardio-\nvascular disease is one of the leading causes of\nmortality in developed countries.\nWe further restricted study selection to multi-\nlevel investigations allowing for estimation of\nbetween-area variation (random effects). As\npointed out by Merlo and colleagues,24 \u2018\u2018clustering\nof individual health within neighbourhoods\n(areas) is not a statistical nuisance that only needs\nto be considered for obtaining correct statistical\nestimations, but a key concept in social epidemiol-\nogy that yields important information by itself\u2019\u2019 (p\n443). As measures of variation provide information\non the portion of health differences among people\nthat may be attributable to the areas in which they\nlive, they are central to understand the significance\nof specific contexts for health.24\nIn keeping with the framework for conducting a\nscoping study proposed by Arksey and O\u2019Malley,36\nAbbreviations: MeSH, medical subject heading; SES,\nsocioeconomic status; SRH, self rated health\n853\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthe specific objectives of the scoping study were: (1) to provide\nan inventory of multilevel investigations of area effects on SRH,\ncardiovascular disease and risk factors, and mortality; (2) to\ndescribe and critically discuss the methodological approaches\nemployed and results observed; and (3) to formulate selected\nrecommendations for advancing the study of area effects on\nhealth.\nMETHODS\nThe scoping study involved three steps.\nFirst step\nIn the first step, the identification of studies published between\nJuly 1998 and December 2005 ensued from a comprehensive\nsearch strategy using the Medline database. We first used\n\u2018\u2018neighbourhood\/neighbourhood or area\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018multilevel\/multi-\nlevel or hierarchical\u2019\u2019 as words in the title or abstract of articles;\nthis search yielded 634 entries. Inclusion criteria for studies were:\npublication in the English language, peer reviewed journals, data\nfrom adult populations in industrialised countries, use of a\nmultilevel design with at least two units of analysis including\nindividuals and areas, and measurement and analysis of health\nindicators at the individual level. Studies exploring between\ncountry variation in health were excluded, though areas opera-\ntionalised by subregions of a country\u2014for example, states\u2014were\nincluded. Of the 634 studies, 67 meet the inclusion criteria.\nWe conducted additional searches using \u2018\u2018contextual effects\u2019\u2019,\n\u2018\u2018place effects\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018census tracts\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018community\u2019\u2019 as words in\ntitle or abstract, and \u2018\u2018residence characteristics and small area\nanalysis\u2019\u2019 as medical subject headings (MeSH), again limiting\nthe search to studies referring to multilevel methods in their\ntitle or abstract. Three additional studies were identified.\nReferences lists of all studies compiled and of other sources\nwere reviewed, yielding an additional 16 studies. In all, 86\nstudies meeting inclusion criteria were retained. In two studies,\nthe investigators reported findings for both self rated health\nand cardiovascular disease risk factors; these studies appear in\nboth categories.39 40 Overall the sample of the scoping study\ncomprised 88 multilevel investigations of area effects on health.\nSecond step\nIn the second step, studies were coded by one of us (MR) along\nthe following dimensions: citation and study location; health\nindicator\/analytical variable; research design, year of data\ncollection for individual sample; individual sample size and\nsex\/age distribution; individual characteristics adjusted for;\narea sample size and operational definition; area level\nexposures; crude between-area variation; adjusted between-\narea variation (for individual level variables); and summary of\nsignificant findings of adjusted area effects. LG and TAB cross\nvalidated half the studies. The coding scheme and abbreviations\nare summarised in table 2.\nThird step\nIn the third step, in order to gauge the accuracy of data\ncompiled, we established interauthor agreement in a random\nsample of about 25% of studies (n = 21) where the coding of\none us (MR) was compared with that of another (TAB) for all\ncoding dimensions except \u2018\u2018citation\/location\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018summary\nfindings of area effects\u2019\u2019. For every dimension, each source of\ninformation was equated with one observation. Discrepancies\nin values reported were considered a disagreement. Overall\ninterauthor agreement was 92.0% (43 disagreements in 513\nobservations), with agreement ranging between 81.0% and\n100% across dimensions. Finally, summary statistics were\ncompiled using the total sample of investigations (n = 88) as\nthe unit of analysis.\nRESULTS\nResults of study coding appear in the supplementary table,\nwhich can be viewed on the journal website (http:\/\/www.jech.-\ncom\/supplemental). Studies are listed alphabetically by sur-\nname of first author within each category of health indicator\u2014\nthat is, self rated health (n = 39), cardiovascular morbidity and\nrisk factors (n = 32), and mortality (n = 17). Table 3 presents\nsummary statistics for research design, operational definition of\narea contours, and exposure as a function of health indicator\nand time period.\nTable 1 Conceptual and methodological issues raised in published reports on area effects on health\nConceptual and methodological\nchallenges Description\nConceptualising causal pathways2\u201310 Absence of fully articulated theoretical frameworks and formulation of testable hypotheses.\nDesignating the ecologic unit of\nanalysis1 11 12\nEcologic units of analysis have been referred to as neighbourhood, small area, local area, and place. These labels have been\nused interchangeably without concern for differences in conceptual and operational definitions even though some have\nargued that there are substantive reasons for appropriately defining the nature of the ecological unit of analysis.\nDefining the spatial contours of the\necological unit of analysis1 5 8 13\u201315\nSpatial contours of small areas are mostly delimited by existing administrative and statistical spatial units. However, these\nareas may be of limited value in examining the association between area level exposures and health outcomes, because they\nmay lack any intrinsic meaning in relation to health, they may not correspond to the spatial distribution of environmental\nfeatures (ecologic exposures) associated with health, and they may be inconsistent with how residents define and experience\ntheir residential area.\nDefining ecologic exposures5 7 13 15 17\u201322 Little attention has been devoted to conceptually and operationally defining ecological exposures as researchers have tended\nto aggregate data from individuals to create meaningful area variables.\nControlling for individual-level\nvariables2 5 13 15 18 23\nLack of consistency in controlling for individual level variables and further lack of consensus on whether individual variables\nshould be conceptualised as confounders, moderators, or mediators of the associations between ecological exposures and\nhealth outcomes.\nPower, sample size, and\nrepresentativeness5 13 15 25\nUsual considerations surrounding statistical power and sample size have been neglected.\nUse of multilevel modelling\ntechniques4 13 15 23 24 26\u201328\nAppropriate use of multilevel modelling techniques has been applied suboptimally, thus limiting novel perspectives that might\nensue from their judicious application: results are mainly reported for fixed effects whereas the potentials of discussing\nconceptual and methodological ramifications of random effects have been ignored.\nDisentangling context from\ncomposition7 8 13 18 27 29\u201334\nSome investigators argue for disentangling the portion of the between area variation in health that is attributable to areas in\nwhich people live (contextual effect) from the portion attributable to individuals\u2019 characteristics (compositional effect), whereas\nothers argued that this is a \u2018\u2018false\u2019\u2019 issue as context and composition are inextricably intertwined.\nDearth of longitudinal and experimental\nstudies8 18 34 35\nFew studies have relied on research designs other than cross sectional. This limits ascertaining the duration and timing of\necological exposures, addressing selection bias, and ascribing causality. Furthermore, as people, areas, and the relation\nbetween the two may change over time, using longitudinal designs is of accrued importance.\n854 Riva, Gauvin, Barnett\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nYear of publication and location of studies\nThere has been a marked increase in the number of studies\npublished on area effects on self rated health, cardiovascular\ndisease and risk factors, and mortality over the 1998\u20132005 time\nperiod, which almost doubled from 2004 to 2005 (fig 1). Most\nresults are from area effects examined in the USA (n = 37) and\nthe United Kingdom (n = 14), although several studies\ninvolved data collected in Canada (n = 10), the Netherlands\n(n = 8), and Sweden (n = 8).\nResearch design and analytical variables\nAs shown in table 3, a majority of studies (80.7%) had cross\nsectional designs, whereas others adopted longitudinal designs\n(17.0%) wherein a majority of studies involved data from a\ncohort that were matched with vital statistics records to\nexamine associations with mortality and cardiovascular disease\nat a later time (designated as \u2018\u2018follow up\u2019\u2019 in the supplementary\ntable). Linear multilevel models for continuous and logistic\nmultilevel models for dichotomous outcomes were the most\ncommonly used statistical models, although some analyses\nwere done on models for ordinal outcomes.45 48 57 64 67 76\nIndividual data: sample size and variables\nSample size of individuals ranged between 57792 and\n2 637 628,101 with a median of 8606 individuals. Sixteen per\ncent of studies had a sample size over 100 000 individuals, but\nthe majority of studies (61%) had a sample size under 10 000.\nMost studies controlled for age, sex, SES, and marital status,\nbut some controlled for other individual characteristics such as\nhealth related behaviours, medical conditions, perception of\narea characteristics, social network, and years of residency in\nthe area. Seven studies did not control for individual\nSES.56 103 104 112 116 121 124 Most studies targeted general popula-\ntions, but some restricted their focus to men,96 118 older\nadults,64 88 92 and racial\/ethnic groups.54 55 59 80 83 95\nArea data: operational definit ion, sample size, and\nexposures\nAs shown in table 3, the majority of studies (89.8%)\noperationalised areas using statistical (for example, census\ntracts) or administrative spatial units (for example, city defined\nneighbourhoods, boroughs, local authorities), or both. One\nstudy delimited areas using geographical information sys-\ntems,107 and others clustered statistical\/administrative spatial\nunits based on similarities in terms of SES, demographic\ncomposition, and type of area.41 45\u201348 76 110 116 Most studies had a\ntwo level structure, with individuals nested within areas,\nthough some had more complex structures, including cross\nclassification,110 and three level structures\u2014for example,\nTable 2 Coding scheme and abbreviations\nCoding dimensions Explanations Abbreviations\nCitation\/location N Surname of first author and year of publication; country where\nstudy undertaken.\nStudies reporting data for both SRH and CVD risk factors\nindicated by asterisks.\nHealth indicator\/analytic\nvariable\nN Self rated health: How would you describe your overall state of\nhealth: excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\nN Risk factors for CVD: physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol\nconsumption, body mass index, overweight and obesity, diabetes,\nhypertension.\nN Mortality: all cause and cause specific mortality where individual\nlevel data available.\nN Analytic variable: treatment of the outcome variable was treated.\nBMI, body mass index; CVD, cardiovascular disease; CHD:\ncoronary heart disease; HBP, high blood pressure; N\u2019hood,\nneighbourhood; PA, physical activity.\nAnalytical variables: dichotomous\/binomial, 0\/1; ordinal\/\nordered categorical, ord; continuous, cont.\nDesign\/year of data collection\n(individual level)\nN Cross sectional, longitudinal (follow up), or case\u2013control\nresearch design.\nN Year of data collection at the individual level.\nSample size individuals (sex\/age\nrange)\nN Sample size of individual data (full dataset) and sex distribution\nand age in years (y) range of the sample.\ny, year\nNR, not reported\nIndividual characteristics\nadjusted for\nN Individual level characteristics adjusted for in multilevel models.

The most commonly\nused integral measure was income inequality, but other studies\nrelied on characteristics of the social and built environ-\nment,50 67 75 92 112 urban sprawl,87 and availability of services\nand parks.81 88 92 95 106 107\nSummary of findings about area effects\nAmong 47 studies that reported on between-area variation after\nadjusting for individual characteristics (minimally age, sex, and\nSES), 27 studies (57.4%) reported significant between-area\nvariation for at least one subgroup (defined either by individual\nor area level characteristics). Although several studies reported\none or the other, several did not report variance components\nfor both unadjusted and adjusted models.\nOf the 88 studies, six focused on between-area variation in\nhealth only56 60 63 73 89 94 and 82 examined main area effects. Of\nthese studies, six did not report significant direct area effects on\nhealth.51 75 93 96 120 122 All other studies reported significant\nassociations between at least one measure of area exposure\nand at least one health indicator. Significant cross level\ninteractions were observed, indicating that subgroups of\nindividuals may be differentially influenced by certain area\ncharacteristics, and by interacting area characteristics. More\nspecifically, effects of area deprivation on poor health,\nunhealthy behaviours, and risk of mortality were often greater\namong low SES individuals and among women.\nSelf rated health\nThirty nine studies examined area effects on self rated health.\nFour studies focused on between-area variation only, and 35\nTa\nb\nle\n3\nSu\nm\nm\nar\ny\nst\nat\nis\ntic\ns\nfo\nr\nre\nse\nar\nch\nde\nsi\ngn\nan\nd\nop\ner\nat\nio\nna\nld\nef\nin\niti\non\nof\nar\nea\nco\nnt\nou\nrs\nan\nd\nex\npo\nsu\nre\nas\na\nfu\nnc\ntio\nn\nof\nhe\nal\nth\nin\ndi\nca\nto\nr\nan\nd\ntim\ne\npe\nri\nod\nC\nod\nin\ng\nd\nim\nen\nsi\non\ns\nSe\nlf\nra\nte\nd\nhe\na\nlth\nC\na\nrd\nio\nva\nsc\nul\na\nr\nm\nor\nb\nid\nity\na\nnd\nri\nsk\nfa\nct\nor\ns\nM\nor\nta\nlit\ny\nTo\nta\nl\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n2\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u20132\n0\n0\n5\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nn\n(%\n)\nD\nes\nig\nn\nC\nro\nss\nse\nct\nio\nna\nl\n1\n6\n(4\n1\n.0\n)\n2\n3\n(5\n9\n.0\n)\n3\n9\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n1\n0\n(3\n1\n.3\n)\n1\n7\n(5\n3\n.1\n)\n2\n7\n(8\n4\n.4\n)\n2\n(1\n1\n.8\n)\n3\n(1\n7\n.6\n)\n5\n(2\n9\n.4\n)\n7\n1\n(8\n0\n.7\n)\nLo\nng\nitu\ndi\nna\nl\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n1\n(3\n.1\n)\n3\n(9\n.4\n)\n4\n(1\n2\n.5\n)\n3\n(1\n7\n.6\n)\n8\n(4\n7\n.1\n)\n1\n1\n(6\n4\n.7\n)\n1\n5\n(1\n7\n.0\n)\nC\nas\ne\u2013\nco\nnt\nro\nl\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n1\n(3\n.1\n)\n1\n(3\n.1\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n1\n(5\n.9\n)\n1\n(5\n.9\n)\n2\n(2\n.3\n)\nTo\nta\nl\n1\n6\n(4\n1\n.0\n)\n2\n3\n(5\n9\n.0\n)\n3\n9\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n1\n1\n(3\n4\n.4\n)\n2\n1\n(6\n5\n.6\n)\n3\n2\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n5\n(2\n9\n.4\n)\n1\n2\n(7\n0\n.6\n)\n1\n7\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n8\n8\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\nA\nre\na\nd\nef\nin\niti\non\nA\ndm\nin\nis\ntr\nat\niv\ne\/\nst\nat\nis\ntic\nal\n1\n4\n(3\n5\n.9\n)\n1\n9\n(4\n8\n.7\n)\n3\n3\n(8\n4\n.6\n)\n1\n1\n(3\n4\n.4\n)\n2\n0\n(6\n2\n.5\n)\n3\n1\n(9\n6\n.9\n)\n5\n(2\n9\n.4\n)\n1\n0\n(5\n8\n.8\n)\n1\n5\n(8\n8\n.2\n)\n7\n9\n(8\n9\n.8\n)\nO\nth\ner\n2\n(5\n.1\n)\n4\n(1\n0\n.3\n)\n6\n(1\n5\n.4\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n1\n(3\n.1\n)\n1\n(3\n.1\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n2\n(1\n1\n.8\n)\n2\n(1\n1\n.8\n)\n9\n(1\n0\n.2\n)\nTo\nta\nl\n1\n6\n(4\n1\n.0\n)\n2\n3\n(5\n9\n.0\n)\n3\n9\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n1\n1\n(3\n4\n.4\n)\n2\n1\n(6\n5\n.6\n)\n3\n2\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n5\n(2\n9\n.4\n)\n1\n2\n(7\n0\n.6\n)\n1\n7\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n8\n8\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\nA\nre\na\nex\np\nos\nur\nes\nD\ner\niv\ned\n1\n5\n(2\n6\n.3\n)\n2\n0\n(3\n5\n.1\n)\n3\n5\n(8\n9\n.7\n)\n8\n(2\n1\n.1\n)\n1\n7\n(4\n4\n.7\n)\n2\n5\n(7\n8\n.1\n)\n5\n(2\n2\n.7\n)\n1\n2\n(5\n4\n.5\n)\n1\n7\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n7\n7\n(8\n7\n.5\n)\nIn\nte\ngr\nal\n5\n(8\n.8\n)\n1\n3\n(2\n2\n.8\n)\n1\n8\n(4\n6\n.2\n)\n3\n(7\n.9\n)\n8\n(2\n9\n.6\n)\n1\n1\n(3\n4\n.4\n)\n2\n(9\n.1\n)\n3\n(1\n3\n.6\n)\n5\n(2\n9\n.4\n)\n3\n4\n(3\n8\n.6\n)\nN\non\ne\n1\n(1\n.8\n)\n3\n(5\n.3\n)\n4\n(1\n0\n.3\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n2\n(5\n.3\n)\n2\n(6\n.3\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n0\n(0\n.0\n)\n6\n(6\n.8\n)\nTo\nta\nl*\n2\n1\n(3\n6\n.8\n)\n3\n6\n(6\n3\n.2\n)\n3\n9\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n1\n1\n(2\n8\n.9\n)\n2\n7\n(7\n0\n.1\n)\n3\n2\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n7\n(3\n1\n.8\n)\n1\n5\n(6\n8\n.1\n)\n1\n7\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n8\n8\n(1\n0\n0\n.0\n)\n*P\ner\nce\nnt\nag\nes\ndo\nno\nt\nad\nd\nup\nto\n1\n0\n0\n%\nbe\nca\nus\ne\nso\nm\ne\nst\nud\nie\ns\nus\ned\nbo\nth\nde\nri\nve\nd\nan\nd\nin\nte\ngr\nal\nm\nea\nsu\nre\ns\nof\nar\nea\nex\npo\nsu\nre\ns.\nFigure 1 Trends in publication of multilevel investigations of area effects\non self rated health, cardiovascular morbidity and risk factors, and\nmortality.\n856 Riva, Gauvin, Barnett\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nwere cross sectional investigations of associations between area\nSES and SRH. In all but two studies,51 75 significant associations\nwere observed between at least one measure of area SES and\nSRH. More specifically, less favourable area socioeconomic\nconditions were associated with poorer SRH. Area affluence,\npositive perceptions of area environment, and higher area levels\nof collective efficacy and social capital were predictive of better\nSRH, although area residential stability was associated with\npoorer health.46 48 One study reported associations between poor\nSRH and unfavourable area level opportunity structures and\nsocial functioning, such as poor physical quality of residential\nenvironment, lower political engagement, and lower transport\nwealth.50 Several studies reported significant effects of social\nprocesses, characteristics of the built environment, and percep-\ntions of area characteristics as potential mediating pathways of\nthe association between area deprivation\/inequality and\nSRH.46 48 51 53 76\nCardiovascular morbidity and risk factors\nThirty two studies were investigations of cardiovascular disease\nand risk factors, of which two examined between-area variation\nonly.89 94 Some studies employed follow up96 101 102 and case\u2013\ncontrol research designs,99 but most were cross sectional.\nTwenty three studies examined the direct main effect of area\ndeprivation on cardiovascular disease and risk factors. In all\nstudies, at least one measure of area deprivation was associated\nwith a greater risk for cardiovascular disease and with at least\none but not all of the risk factors investigated. In general,\ngreater levels of area deprivation and inequality were associated\nwith a greater likelihood of unhealthy dietary habits, smoking,\noverweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. However,\npositive associations between affluence and smoking and\ndrinking behaviours were also observed,78 79 104 and in one\nstudy, greater state inequality was associated with lower body\nmass index among white women.80 A greater likelihood of\nwalking was observed in more deprived areas,88 106 but also in\nmore socially cohesive areas.88\nIn studies where area exposures were operationalised with\nintegral variables, results showed that in less sprawling areas,\nthe risk of being overweight or obese was lower and levels of\nwalking were higher.87 Involvement in physical activity and\nwalking was more likely in areas characterised by greater\navailability, accessibility, and density of selected services and\ngreen spaces.87 88 92 106 107 Dietary habits were associated with the\npresence of supermarkets and full service restaurants in the\narea,95 and greater mean distance to alcohol outlets was\nassociated with lower alcohol consumption.98 High convenience\nstore density and lower distance to convenience store were\nassociated with smoking, although this association was not\nsignificant in models controlling for area SES.81\nMortality\nSeventeen studies examined area effects on mortality, most of\nwhich reported results from matching of cohort data with vital\nstatistics.\nIn all but two studies,120 122 results showed that at least one\nmeasure of area SES was associated with all cause and cause\nspecific mortality, such that greater area deprivation and\nincome inequality were significantly associated with greater\nrisk of mortality. When adjusting for area SES, greater area\nreligious affiliation was associated with lower risk of all cause\nmortality,113 and areas with higher social capital were asso-\nciated with lower risk of all cause mortality and mortality from\nheart disease,116 while lower levels of social cohesion were\nassociated with higher risk of all cause mortality.118 Area SES\nconfounded the association between air pollution and all cause\nand cause specific mortality.115\nDISCUSSION\nResults of the scoping study showed that the typical methodo-\nlogical approach for multilevel investigations of area effects\nremains a cross sectional two level study wherein individuals\nare nested within areas delimited by administrative\/statistical\nspatial units, area level indicators are operationalised using\naggregates of individual variables, and direct associations\nbetween area exposures and individual level outcomes are\nadjusted for selected individual characteristics. Various large\ndatasets produced several publications, and it should be noted\nthat findings emanating from the same dataset clearly are not\nindependent.\nOver-reliance on cross sectional research designs raises the\ncritical issue of \u2018\u2018self selection\u2019\u2019\u2014that is, the fact that people\nwill be selected into residential areas based on individual\nattributes which are themselves related to health.2 To deal with\nthis issue, one frequently used strategy consists of controlling\nfor individual level variables that are potential confounders of\nassociations between area characteristics and health outcomes.\nAlthough useful, this modelling strategy does not overcome\nproblems associated with misspecification resulting from\nomitted or mismeasured individual level variables, or with lack\nof statistical power. Addressing these methodological issues\nrests on crafting longitudinal studies, assessing individual\ncharacteristics over the life course, and endeavouring to study\ncross level interactions and mediating pathways. In this regard,\nseveral investigators have emphasised the value of innovative\nmethodological approaches.125\nIn multilevel studies, there are at least two units of analysis:\nindividuals and areas. However, the attention that is usually\ndevoted to measuring individual attributes is infrequently\ncarried over to areas. For example, in six studies area sample\nsize was not reported, and most studies provided little informa-\ntion on the validity and reliability of area level measures of\nexposure. When measuring exposure, most studies relied on\nindicators of area SES derived from censuses and other surveys.\nAlthough easily accessible, such measures provide only trun-\ncated information about the context of areas,7 17 and may in fact\nbe endogenous to the composition of the areas as they are\ndetermined by individual characteristics of residents.2 35 To this\nend, some studies have tapped into measuring area exposures by\nmeans of ecometric procedures.20 23 45 46 48\nMost studies employed administrative or statistical spatial\nunits to define area contours, despite their recognised limita-\ntions\u2014that is, their potential lack of intrinsic meaning in\nrelation to health.1 5 8 13\u201315 Such limitations are evidenced by\nvariations in the strength and magnitude of area effects on\nhealth according to the operational definition of areas.44 58 65 111\nWe view as particularly innovative recent initiatives to define\narea contours by delimiting a radius around individual\nresidential location and post codes.107 126 127\nBetween-area variation was reported using a variety of\nstatistical parameters including variance components and\nstandard error coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients\nfor continuous and dichotomous outcomes, plausible value\nranges, and others, which precludes comparisons across\nstudies. Furthermore, several studies did not report variance\ncomponents for either unadjusted or adjusted models. This is\nunfortunate given the importance of measures of variation for\nunderstanding the socio-spatial patterning of health. There is\nclearly a need for more detailed and consistent reporting of\nbetween-area variation.24\nPower estimation in multilevel studies is complicated by the\nneed to account for the nested structure of the data.128 Only one\nstudy reported power calculations.91 Routine reporting of a\npriori power estimates and post hoc effect size calculations is\nwarranted in multilevel studies.\nSmall area effects on health 857\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nAlthough significant area effects were reported in a majority\nof studies, critical examination of findings revealed incon-\nsistencies within and across studies. For example, one study\nexamined associations between area deprivation and SRH for\ndifferent operational definitions of area; significant area effects\nwere observed for one type of area only.65 Others have examined\neffects of area deprivation on several cardiovascular disease risk\nfactors, but observed significant effects only for some of\nthem.78 83 Within individual studies, associations between\nhealth and several indicators of area SES were frequently\ninvestigated. Although there is probably multicolinearity\nbetween measures of area exposures,44 81 119 124 often only\ncertain indicators were significantly associated with the health\noutcome. This suggests that indicators of area SES such as\naverage income, educational attainment, and income inequality\nmay be tapping into different aspects of the social environment\nand may be differently associated with specific health out-\ncomes. In addition, a few studies reported no significant area\neffects. Of concern, findings of the scoping study show that\narea effects on a specific health indicator may be dependent on\nthe measure of area exposure and the spatial level (area unit) at\nwhich associations are investigated. This clearly underscores\nthe importance of conceptualising plausible causal pathways in\nthe search for new knowledge.\nThe diversity in research designs employed and in the\nreported results calls attention to the need to move toward a\nset of reporting guidelines for multilevel investigations of area\neffects on health. This could include, but not be exclusive to,\nthe following: first, greater details accorded to the description\nof the nested structure of the database with systematic\nreporting of sample size at both individual and area levels,\nand a more explicit discussion of the validity and reliability of\narea level measures of exposures; second, description of the\nanalytical strategy in such a way that would allow replication of\nanalyses; and third, better description of the between-cluster\nvariation in health outcomes, both in unadjusted and adjusted\nmodels for individual characteristics.24\nLimitations\nThe main limitation of our scoping study pertains to inclusion\ncriteria for studies. A first issue concerns keyword and MeSH\nsearches in the Medline database. Because the area of research\nemerged only recently, keywords listed by authors do not\nnecessarily correspond to keywords used for searching the\nliterature in the MeSH system. Rather, when searching for\n\u2018\u2018neighbourhood\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018area\u2019\u2019, MeSH uses the terms \u2018\u2018residence\ncharacteristics\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018small area analysis\u2019\u2019. Thus if these MeSH\nterms were not used to classify an article, and if the selected\nkeyword\u2014that is, \u2018\u2018neighbourhood\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018area\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018multilevel\u2019\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2018hierarchical\u2019\u2019\u2014were not specified either in the title or in the\nabstract of an article, then it would not have been identified. To\novercome this problem, more encompassing terms were used\nand reference lists of all identified articles were reviewed to\nidentify studies. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that some\nstudies may not have been identified with our search strategy.\nA second limitation pertains to the exclusion of the literature\non area effects on mental health, non-cardiovascular disease\nmorbidity, paediatric populations, maternal health, and health\nservices utilisation. Several of these studies have used\ninnovative methodological approaches and analytical proce-\ndures which could provide the reader with other perspectives\non area effects on health.126 127 129 130 It seems relevant to\nundertake a review of these studies as well to ascertain\nsimilarities and differences in the range and types of\ninvestigations conducted.\nConclusions\nThe results of the scoping study raise several important issues.\nOne issue pertains to whether or not \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 area effects are\nconcealed by less than adequate methodologies. This may\nindeed be the case. Several studies showed significant between-\narea variation and area effects independently of individual\ncharacteristics. These are quite considerable findings given that\nmost studies suffered from methodological limitations and lack\nof precision when operationalising and measuring context.\nSignificant results garnered with such measurement error\nprobably underestimate effect sizes.\nIn recent years, increased attention has been directed\ntowards formulating and testing theoretically based pathways\nbetween more specific area level measures of exposures and\nmore specific health indicators, such as the effect of the density\nof food stores on dietary habits, or the effect of urban form on\nphysical activity involvement. These measures of area expo-\nsures may be more proximal to influence everyday health\nrelated behaviours, thus operating on the pathways between\narea SES and broader health outcomes.\nA second issue is whether or not widely used methodologies\nfor studying areas and health are well suited to the task.\nMultilevel modelling, without being a panacea, is a suitable\nstatistical procedure that can be used to analyse data with\nnested sources of variability, while accounting for the non-\nindependence of within-cluster observations\u2014that is, addres-\nsing the non-random processes situating people with similar\ncharacteristics into certain types of areas.25 As operationalisa-\ntion of area contours essentially falls back on using readily\navailable spatial units such as census tracts, space is fragmen-\nted into seemingly independent area units, therefore ignoring\nspatial associations between areas. As pointed out by Chaix and\ncolleagues,126 multilevel modelling procedures are based on the\nassumption that spatial correlations can be reduced to within-\narea correlation. For this reason, multilevel approaches may\nprovide only limited information on the spatial distribution of\nhealth outcomes and ecological exposures, both when model-\nling variations and when investigating associations.126 Further\ndebates underscore limitations of multilevel models in detect-\ning causal effects of area exposures on health outcomes.2 15 35 131\nAnother issue relates to the most promising approaches in\nthis area of research. In recent years, didactic and conceptual\ntutorials linking social epidemiological concepts to multilevel\nanalysis have been published.24 26 28 132 Innovative methodolo-\ngical approaches and analytical procedures have been applied to\nexamining area effects on health, such as geographical\ninformation systems used to operationalise area contours and\necological exposures,107 126 127 development of measurement\ntechnology (for example, ecometrics20 22 45 46 48), geostatistical\nmodelling and spatial analysis,47 115 126 133 multilevel path ana-\nlyses,92 and multilevel structural equation modelling to test\npotential mediating pathways between area exposures and\nhealth outcomes.53 88 Others have underscored the value of\ndeveloping experimental research designs such as randomised\ncommunity trials,35 and natural134 and social experiments.135\nWhat seems to emerge from the accumulating evidence on\narea effects on health is a \u2018\u2018specific\u2019\u2019 research agenda. As argued\nby other investigators,17 133 136 we espouse the view that the\nadoption of a specific research approach to examine area effects\non health\u2014that is, one that would conceptualise, operationalise,\nand measure associations between specific health outcomes and\nWhat is already known\nN A significant portion of the variation in health is\nassociated with area context independently of individual\ncharacteristics.\n858 Riva, Gauvin, Barnett\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nspecific area exposures\u2014across specific spatial area units may\nyield more informative evidence of area effects.

The implementation\nand evaluation of policy interventions aimed at changing\narea exposures represents an opportunity to fill this\nknowledge gap.\nSmall area effects on health 859\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \n41 Be\u00b4land F, Birch S, Stoddart G.
