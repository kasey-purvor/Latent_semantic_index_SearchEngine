This paper provides a chronological study of rammed earth distribution through \nobservation of monumental buildings to aid the study of this building technique.

Removable formwork is installed, and the soil compacted \nwithin it. The technique is widespread but the distribution of rammed earth across the \nworld and its development over time has not previously been fully documented. Many \nsources quote the same examples of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, parts of the Great Wall \nof China, and the Alhambra in Granada. The distribution of rammed earth is however \nmore complex than usually portrayed, appearing to spread over the world in a number of \ntemporal waves, each precipitated by a different set of needs. \n \n \nIn this paper we first present a strict definition of the rammed earth technique, identifying \nit by name in different languages. We show that the rammed earth technique appears to \nhave developed independently in China and around the Mediterranean. The technique \nthen spread with the movement of peoples to different parts of the world. Rammed earth \nhas continually been reinvented as a building material. At times it has been used as a \nquick technique for the building of fortifications, a cheap way a man can build his own \nhome, and a sustainable construction technique using only what is available on site.  \n \nThe paper concentrates on monumental rather than vernacular architecture, as \nmonumental architecture is better documented and preserved. It is assumed that \nrammed earth was used as a vernacular technique where it is found as monumental \nbuildings. The examples given are taken from a wide literature review and from field \nvisits by the authors to Spain and India.  The two identified nuclei of rammed earth are \ndealt with separately, beginning with China. It is shown that similar techniques to those \nin China are found in central Asia and India. Rammed earth around the Mediterranean is \nthen discussed, its spread into Europe, and use during the Muslim caliphates. European \nmigration to the Americas and to Australasia spread rammed earth to regions where it \ndid not previously exist, but now flourishes. The differences between these two schools \nof historic rammed earth architecture are shown. Because the technique is not found in \nPre-Columbian America or Australasia prior to European settlement the spread of \nrammed earth from these centres explains the current geographical distribution of \nrammed earth. \n \nIn a study of this nature it is likely that some rammed earth architecture is missing and \nthere may be rammed earth sites which should be added. The nature of earthen \narchitecture means that sites are extremely vulnerable to decay, and thus historic sites \nmay no longer exist in a useful form to be studied. Further investigation is clearly \nrequired, but it is hoped that this paper is able to broadly outline the distribution and \ndevelopment of what we term \u201chistoric\u201d rammed earth. \n \n \n \nDefining \u201crammed earth\u201d \nThe term rammed earth has been used to describe a large number of different \nprocesses involving the dynamic compaction of soil to form a solid mass. This has led to \nconfusion and misdiagnosis amongst practitioners, and the following three distinct \nprocesses are therefore outlined. \n \n1. Compaction of a large area to make level. This is known as a rammed earth floor \nand its use is again becoming popular in modern architecture. \n \n2. Raising of mounds or platforms by the repeated addition and compaction of soil.  \nSoil would be taken from the surroundings, placed and compacted to increase the \nheight of an area. This method is seen as the production of defensive ramparts. \n \n3. Compaction of soil between formwork boards, which are later removed. This is \nthe process by which rammed earth walls are formed. This differs from 2 in that \nvertical faces of soil are formed, and remain exposed above ground. This is the \ndefinition which is used throughout the rest of this paper. This technique is known \nas pise in French, tapial in Spanish and taipa in Portuguese. \n \nDifficulty arises when describing similar techniques in various languages. In Spanish \ntapial is used to define rammed earth, but is broadly used for placement of material \nbetween removable formwork.  Many tapial structures in Aragon, Spain are constructed \nusing gravel cemented with lime, but cannot be considered as rammed earth. In Central \nAmerica, the word tapial is used to describe a technique which is actually a hybrid of \nrammed earth and wattle and daub (Easton 1996). The term hangtu is used by Chinese \narchaeologists to describe both rammed earth mounds and earth rammed between \nformwork. In Farsi chineh and in Uzbek pakhsa are the terms used for earth walls built \nup without formwork, known in English as cob. A variation on pakhsa described by \nSchroeder et al. (2005) involves the throwing of moist clay into formwork, which is then \nremoved and the resulting bricks stacked to form a wall. The layered technique (Walls \n \n2003) is similar to hangtu and cob, but a layer of lime is spread over a compacted layer \nprior to construction of the next. \nChina \nWarren (1993) observes that the simplest form of construction on the alluvial plains of \nnorthern China is rammed earth. Nomadic peoples in China began to form permanent \nsettlements during the Lung-shan era (c. 2310-1810BC). These settlements became \nringed with defensive walls, initially no more than mounds and ditches, but as the size of \nthe settlements grew, so did the size and complexity of the encircling walls. Walls were \ninitially constructed by heaping soil to form a rhomboid section wall, with the base width \nincreasing in proportion to the height. Yunxiang (2003) describes how these initially \nrhomboid walls may have been cut to present a vertical exterior face. Later soil may \nhave been heaped against a single vertical timber wall acting as formwork, which was \nthen removed. The technique may then have developed by the placing of two parallel \nvertical timber walls, with soil heaped against each one, and finally the rammed earth \ntechnique defined above was developed. \n \nThe Lung-shan sites of Lianyungang, Jiangsu and Taosi, in Shanxi Province (see Figure \n1 for locations) are encircled with large rammed earth mound walls. Taosi is also the site \nof what is considered to be the world\u2019s oldest observatory, which has a rammed earth \nwall of 60m diameter (Da 2003). The first definite use of formwork boards for the \nproduction of rammed earth walls comes from the walled Lung-shan settlement of \nPingliangtai in Henan Province in the middle Yellow River area, where traces of small \nwooden boards used for formwork and ramming tools have been found (Yunxiang \n2003). Pingliangtai has walls 13m wide at the base and the walls are still 3m high over \n4000 years after construction. The walls here form a square around the village of side \nlength 185m (Owen 2006). Due to the great thickness of these walls, it is thought that \nthe walls were constructed by heaping soil against two removable timber walls.  \n \n \nThe foundations of rammed earth walls have been found at palace complexes in Erlitou \nand Longwan, Hubei dated to 1900BC-1500BC (Hong 2005). Rammed earth mound \nwalls were likely to have been used at the city of Cheng tzu-yai, Shantung where walls \n9m wide and 6m high have been found (Wenke 1999). Excavations at the Shang \ndynasty (1600-1000BC) capital in Anyang city, Henan carried out in 1933 revealed a \nrammed earth wall 70m long and 2-4m wide (Houben and Guillaud 1994), and the cities \nof Linzi and Xiadu, built during the Warring States period (475-221BC), were encircled \nwith massive rammed mound walls, up to 30m thick at the base (Shen 1994). The Qin \ndynasty (221BC-206BC) were the first to construct a wall along the northern frontier of \nChina, using stone in the mountain ranges, and rammed earth in the plains. However it \nis in the Great Wall where the use of rammed earth is most recorded. The Han (206BC-\n202AD) and Jin (265-420) dynasties repaired or rebuilt the walls, but few sections \nremain, and thus it is impossible to tell the nature of their construction (Jiyao and \nWeitung 1990).  \n \nHouben and Guillaud (1994) argue that a \u2018true\u2019 rammed earth technique was first \ndeveloped during the Three Kingdoms Period (221AD to 581AD), where formwork was \nheld in place by long poles driven into the ground. This type of construction was used by \nthe Hakka people, who originated in the Henan and Shanxi provinces.  The Sui dynasty \n(581-618) reunited northern and southern China, and was followed by the Tang dynasty \n(618-907) which came under attack from Turkic tribes to the north of China. The Tang \ndynasty built cities (for example Jiahoe, Gaochang and Xi\u2019an) along the Silk Route, each \nencircled with large rammed earth walls (Jiyao and Weitung 1990). The Tang fort of \nBaishui, at the western end of the Silk Route is constructed wholly in rammed earth \n(Xinhua 2007). Upheaval at the end of the Tang dynasty led to the southward migration \nof the Hakka, who moved to Guangdong, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. The influx of the \nHakka into these regions drove them into conflict with their new neighbours and they \nconstructed the fortified farms known as Tu lou (meaning earthen structures). The Tu \nlou are large round or square rammed earth structures, which take many years to build \nand often house the whole family. There is only one entrance and no windows at ground \nlevel, making the structure easily defensible. The Tu lou are usually over 4 storeys high, \n \nwith walls over 1m thick, and can be between 60 and 90m in diameter. The highest \nconcentration of Tu lou is in Nanjing County, Fujian, where within a radius of 25km, \nthere are over 2000 such buildings (Aaberg-J\u00f8rgensen 2000). \n \nThe Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) arose from the defeat of the Jin empire by the Mongols, \nand saw a period of Chinese expansionism. Constant trouble from the Mongols on the \nnorthern borders led to the upgrade and repair of the Great Wall at this time. Sections of \nthe Ming wall were stronger than previous walls, being built in fired brick and stone, such \nas the famous section north of Beijing, but sections in the far west of China continued to \nbe constructed in rammed earth. The walls of Xi\u2019an, the Ming capital city, were initially \nconstructed in rammed earth, and are 18m wide at the base and 12m high. In 1558 they \nwere faced with brick, and so the rammed earth is now invisible (Jiyao and Weitung \n1990). The town of Cockcrow, north of Beijing was established in 1420 and has a \nmassive masonry fronted rammed earth wall now under the protection of the World \nMonument Fund (Evarts 2006). The greatest lengths of rammed earth in the Ming Great \nWall occur in Ningxia province (Evarts 2006; Smith 2006), where sections of wall \noriginally 9m high are constructed in layers of 15 to 30cm high, to form a rhomboid \nshaped wall (Figure 5). A number of forts are constructed along the wall at for example \nJiayuguan and Hexibao. Jiayuguan Fort was begun in 1372 and the bottom 6m of walls \nare rammed earth, but were raised using adobe bricks to their current height of 9m \n(Fletcher and Nicholas 2007). The use of rammed earth as a monumental building \nmaterial in China appears to decline following the construction of the Ming wall. \nRammed earth may have been extensively used in Tibet, and is certainly found at the \nPotala Palace in the capital Lhasa (Hurd 2006), and may thus have spread south to the \nHimalayas. \n \nHimalayas \nRammed earth is found extensively in the Himalayan kingdoms of Ladakh, Mustang \n(part of Nepal) and Bhutan (Figures 10 & 11). These kingdoms trace much of their \nhistory from Tibet and China to north, rather than India to the south. It is possible that \n \nthe same rammed earth techniques used in China and Central Asia were also used in \nthe Himalayas. Rammed earth is considered to be the oldest construction technique in \nLadakh, its use preceding that of sun dried mud brick (Jest et al. 1990). Evidence of the \nhistoric use of rammed earth in the Himalaya is provided by a rammed earth fortress at \nBasgo, Ladakh which was constructed before 1357 (Howard 1995). Lo Manthang the \ncapital of Mustang in Nepal is surrounded by a rammed earth wall which was built in \n1380 (UNITAR 2006). Much of the monumental and vernacular architecture in western \nBhutan is rammed earth (Nock 1995). Rammed earth was a successful construction \ntechnique used for Muslim fortifications in north Africa and Spain from the 8th century. \nAlthough the initial Muslim expansion (in 712AD) did not reach the Himalayas, there \nwere repeated incursions into Ladakh during the 15th century. These incursions \ndestroyed much of the monumental architecture, making it impossible to know if \nrammed earth was present prior to this period (Rizvi 1996). An Indo-Muslim manuscript \nwritten in Urdu (date unknown), details rammed earth construction (Acedo 2006 pp 51). \nFollowing the Muslim incursions into Ladakh, rammed earth was used for fortress \nconstruction at the towns of Shey and Leh. The technique is still used today where \ncorrugated steel sheeting is seen to have been used as formwork, producing corrugated \nrammed earth walls. \nMiddle East and Central Asia  \nEvidence of rammed earth in the Middle East is very scarce. Ochsenschlager (1998) is \nconvinced that the rammed earth used by modern Iraqi Marsh Arabs was used in \nantiquity, but a lack of archaeological investigation of the region means that identification \nof historic rammed earth is currently unlikely. Walls (2003, 2004) identifies the layered \ntechnique used in Oman and Iran, but this technique is more similar to cob. At Bam in \nIran, a highly studied site following the 2003 earthquake, the majority of construction is \nin adobe or chineh with only a few examples of rammed earth (Langenbach 2004). In \nUzbekistan pakhsa walls are found (Schroeder et al. 2005) which involve no formwork, \nbut pakhsa walls observed by Cooke (2005b) appear to have been constructed using \nformwork, in a manner which would be described as rammed earth. Construction in \nrammed earth in these regions is hampered by the lack of available timber for formwork \n \n(Schroeder et al. 2005), and as such any earth construction would take the form of cob, \nadobe or similar which do not require large timber formwork. Locations of these sites are \nshown in Figure 1. \n \nJest et al. (1990) argue that remnants of rammed earth walls and houses have been \nfound at Qinghai, Tsaidam between Tibet and Central Asia, which are thought to date \nfrom the Muomhong period (2000-500BC). Marshak (1990) and Turkekulova (2005) cite \nthe mud brick city of Penjikent (Tajikistan) as the highlight of pre-Islamic culture on the \nSilk Route. The city, established in the 5th century AD, is surrounded by earthen walls, \nand the ground floors of many buildings are constructed in rammed earth. The city was \nrazed by the Muslim expansion in 722 and is now a working archaeological site, but \nmany of the uncovered earth buildings quickly disintegrate once exposed. The Muslim \nexpansion brought the destruction of many earthen sites in Central Asia, and further \narchaeological investigation is required to establish the building techniques used \n(Stevens & Talon-Noppe 1983). City walls and buildings constructed in rammed earth at \nKhar Balgas city in Mongolia, capital of the Uyghur Empire (745 - 840) were uncovered \nby Russian archaeologists in 1949 but only a small amount of investigation has taken \nplace. The site was declared a World Heritage site in 2004 (ICOMOS 2002; UNESCO \n2003). Many Silk Route sites which survived the Muslim expansion were later razed by \nGenghis Khan in his campaigns in the 13th century. The fragile nature of earthen \nconstruction means that little remains of many central Asian historic sites (Turkekulova \n2005). \nMediterranean (Figure 2) \nRammed earth appears to first have been used in Phoenician settlements around the \nMediterranean. The Phoenicians spread from modern Lebanon, founding numerous \ncities along the Mediterranean including the Carthage in 814BC. Excavations of \nPhoenician settlements suggest the use of rammed earth both in north Africa (Carthage, \nKerouane and Utique (Houben and Guillaud 1994)) and in Spain (Morro de Mequitilla \n(Chazelles 1993)). Michon (1990) argues that the art of rammed earth building was \n \npractised by in north African by oasis dwellers. Pliny the Elder describes rammed earth \ntowers constructed by the Carthaginian general Hannibal (invader of Iberia 218BC): \n \n\u2018Moreover, are there not in Africa and Spain walls made of earth \nthat are called framed walls, because they are made by packing a \nframe enclosed between two boards, one on each side, and so are \nstuffed rather than built, and do they not last for ages, undamaged \nby rain, wind and fire, and stronger than quarry stone? Spain still \nsees the watchtowers of Hannibal and turrets of earth placed on \nmountain ridges\u2019 (Pliny and Healy, 1991). \n \nThe Romans admired rammed earth from a distance, using pozzolanic based concrete \nin preference to rammed earth, but Vitruvius\u2019 De architectura, a systematic compilation \nof the construction techniques known to the Romans and written between 27 and 23 BC \nreports rammed earth used in the city of Marseilles. Recent excavations of 3rd century \nAD sites at La Lagaste, Entremont, Martigues, Marignane, Mouries, Ruscino and Lyon \nin southern France have all uncovered sections of rammed earth walls (Houben and \nGuillaud 1994). The Latin verb pinsere is coined for the action of ramming earth and has \npassed into French as pise.  \nMuslim expansion \nWhile it is obvious that rammed earth was used as a construction technique before and \nduring Roman times, the use of rammed earth may have increased through the \nexpansion of Islam. Following the death of Muhammad in 632, Muslim armies spread \nquickly from the Arabian Peninsula, controlling Persia by 656. The Armenian city of \nYerevan was taken in 658, and is now surrounded by a historic rammed earth wall (Hurd \n2006). By 705 modern Afghanistan was Muslim, and the Indus River, the most easterly \npoint of the empire, was reached in 712.  \n \nThe Iberian peninsula was invaded in 711, and the maximum extent of the occupation \noccurred around 756. There has been a continued presence of Islam in Persia, the \n \nArabian Peninsula and north Africa since the initial expansion, and in Iberia a Muslim \npresence lasted until 1492. \n \nThe use of rammed earth may have increased with the growth of the Muslim Almoravid \nand Almohade Berber dynasties which originated from the Sahara and ruled north Africa \nand Iberia.  The famous Berber Kasbahs in the Draa and Dades valleys of A\u00eft Ben \nHaddou and Tamnougalt are now World Heritage sites but the date of their construction \nis unknown. In Marrakesh the city walls and the El Badi Palace, constructed in 1578 are \nconstructed mainly in rammed earth. Much of the vernacular architecture in Morocco is \nstill rammed earth. \n \nAzuar-Ruiz (1995) argues that a lack of evidence means that it is not possible to trace \nthe use of rammed earth prior to the 9th century in Iberia. The first rammed earth may \nhave been the castle of Badajoz, built in 874, of which nothing now remains. However \ntown fortifications in Calatayud and Pla d\u2019Almata dated to 884 have been uncovered. \nGraciani-Garc\u00eda &Tabales-Rodr\u00edguez (2003) argue that the oldest walls in the Alcazar of \nSeville (circa 914) constructed as dressed stone with a compacted mortar fill, are \nrammed earth, but this is considered to be the Roman technique of opus quadratum \nrather than rammed earth.  \n \nInternal political strife in Iberia at the end of the 10th century led to the construction of \ncastles (for example Ba\u00f1os de la Encina, Figure 6) which were built using rammed earth \nas a speedy construction method which producing durable fortifications. During this \nperiod separate kingdoms (Taifas) ruled small parts of the peninsula, constructing many \nfortifications (for example the Alcazar in Granada, Figure 7). Following repeated \nChristian incursions, the Iberian Muslims requested the assistance of the Almohade \nrulers of north Africa. The majority of rammed earth castle sites in southern Spain are \nassociated with the Almohade era (for example Castle of la Atalaya, Villena, Figure 8), \nalthough dating the initial construction of these sites is extremely difficult. The technique \nwas widespread during the 11th and 12th centuries, and Moses Maimonides, a Jewish \n \nwriter and philosopher, born in Cordoba in 1135, but residing in Morocco, Egypt and \nIsrael wrote of rammed earth: \n \nThe builders take two boards, about six cubits long and two cubits \nhigh and place them parallel to each other on their edges, as far \napart as the thickness of the wall they wish to build; they steady \nthese boards with pieces of wood fastened with cords. The space \nbetween the boards is then filled with earth, which is beaten down \nfirmly with hammers or stampers; this is continued until the wall \nreaches the requisite height and the boards are withdrawn. Moses \nMaimonides, cited Cooke (2005a) \nLate Medieval Europe  \nThe Muslim rule in Spain waned, and the last Muslim king of Granada was removed in \n1492. The Christian rulers of Spain initially employed the Muslim population as \ncraftsmen and artisans, and the rammed earth technique is found throughout Christian \nSpain. Fired brick began to be mixed with rammed earth (Gerrard 2003), and the \nintroduction of artillery led to the cladding of rammed earth walls in masonry. Some \nstrategic military structures were strengthened and enlarged in stone by the Christians \n(Figure 8), but rammed earth continued to be used for both strategic and vernacular \narchitecture (Jaquin et al. 2007). In Spain rammed earth was used for military \narchitecture (e.g. Figure 9) and vernacular architecture until the 19th century (Font & \nHidalgo 1991; Gerrard 2003). \n \nVernacular rammed earth in southern France may have been prevalent in Christian \nmedieval France, because rammed earth was introduced into Switzerland from the Lyon \nregion of France around 1660 where the alluvial soils proved ideal for rammed earth \nconstruction. The oldest Swiss rammed earth constructions are Gonzenbach castle \noutbuildings near Geneva (Kleespies 2000).  \n \nExpansion to the Americas (Figure 3) \nRammed earth was not found in the Americas prior to 1492. In 1549 Manuel da \nNobrega, a Jesuit missionary sent a request to Europe to send \u2018artisans able to handle \nloam, and carpenters, for the construction of a rammed earth wall\u2019.  Jose de Anchieta, a \nSpanish Jesuit arrived, and supervised the construction of Colegio da Companhia de \nJesus in Piratininga, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (Puccioni 1993). Tibbets (1989) and Easton \n(1996) argue that the first rammed earth in North America used a soil and sea shell mix, \ncompacted in heavy formwork, found in St Augustine, Florida and built in 1556. \n \nRammed earth was used in the Goi\u00e1s and Minas Geras areas of Brazil (Oliver 1997; \nJusti-Pisani 2004), In S\u00e3o Paulo the cathedral of Taubat\u00e9 was constructed from rammed \nearth in 1645 (Alvarenga 1993; Pereira 1993; Vinuales 1993) and the Church of Our \nLady of the Rosary in 1720 (Pecoraro 1993). In S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei the Basilica of Our \nLady of Pillar was built sometime in the early 18th century (Lima and Puccioni 1990). In \nGoi\u00e1s, the House of the Chamber constructed in 1776 is of very similar architecture to \nthat found in Portugal in the late 18th century (McHenry 1984). Rammed earth use was \nwidespread in S\u00e3o Paulo and the surrounding during the 18th and early 19th century. \nHowever in 1850 following flooding in the city a public campaign against the use of \nrammed earth led to a reduction in the use and demolition of much of the rammed earth \narchitecture (Pecoraro 1993; Pereira 1993; Justi-Pisani 2004). A small number of \nexamples of rammed earth architecture still exist, such as the Chapel of Morumbi which \nwas built in 1850 on farmland outside of S\u00e3o Paulo and is now a national monument.  \n18th century Europe \nThe prevailing political climate in Europe at the end of the 18th century was of revolution \nand for a rise in status of the common worker. Rammed earth began to be championed \nas a low cost owner-builder construction technique. In France G C Goiffon published Art \ndu macon piseur in Le Jai, an obscure Paris journal in 1772 and in 1786 Fran\u00e7ois \nBoulard published an article on rammed earth in Cours Complet d'Architecture (Cody \n1990). Neither article was as successful as the series of pamphlets published by \nFran\u00e7ois Cointeraux in 1791. Cointeraux lived in Lyon and \u201crediscovered\u201d the rammed \n \nearth legacy left by the Phoenicians almost 2000 years earlier. Cointeraux conducted a \nnumber of experiments on rammed earth, detailed in four documents (Cointeraux 1791; \nFigure 12) which were distributed around Europe. Gilly (1798) translated the works into \nGerman and Guiseppe del Rosso, an architect in Toscana, Italy published a rammed \nearth construction manual probably inspired by the work of Cointeraux (Bertagnin 1993). \nEnglish translations of Cointeraux\u2019s work were published in 1798 in England by Holland \nand Salmon (1798) and in the United States by Johnson (1806). \n \nA large number of barns and agricultural buildings were constructed to Cointeraux\u2019s \nspecifications in rammed earth and can be found in the Lyon area of France (CRATerre \n2006). In the rest of Europe, known surviving large buildings include a three storey hotel \nin Marcon, France, constructed in 1790 (McHenry 1984). In Germany a fire resistant \nhouse was constructed in 1795 by the head of the local fire service in Meldof, \nSchleswig-Holstein, who wanted an alternative to timber construction. Haus Rath in \nWeilburg an der Lahn, was constructed in 1828 which climbs to five storeys (Guntzel \n1990; Steingass 2005). \n \nIn the early 18th century a group of craftsmen travelled through Norway and Sweden \nbuilding in rammed earth using fixed formwork filled with lime mortar and slag of pebbles \nand stone. The increase in popularity of rammed earth was brought about by the \nperceived ecological crisis engulfing Europe at the time, which was seeking alternatives \nto timber construction to prevent deforestation in Europe (Palmgreen 2005). A Swedish \nmining engineer built houses in Hartz (1735) and Falun (1739). Lime production led to \nthe construction of rammed lime buildings in the middle of the 19th century. In Sweden \noutbuildings of the Karlsborg Fortress in Stockholm were built from rammed earth in \n1842 and parts of the summer residence of the Queen of Norway was constructed in \nrammed earth at Kongsvinger in 1890. However following the introduction of locally \nproduced Portland cement in Scandinavia at the turn of the 20th century, rammed earth \nfell into decline (Palmgreen 2005). \n \n18th and 19th century migration \nThe late 18th and 19th centuries saw the first truly mass migrations of peoples. \nMovement of peoples to North America, Australia and New Zealand brought previously \nunknown skills and customs to these lands. Rammed earth spread from rural to urban \nChina, and from China and Europe to America. European settlers to Australia and New \nZealand experimented in rammed earth. Rammed earth did not succeed everywhere, \nbut there are many examples of historic rammed earth structures built by these \nimmigrants. \n \nHoi Pa Village, Hong Kong, grew up in the 18th and 19th centuries built by Hakka \npeoples who had migrated south. The Fan Sin Kung temple in Hong Kong was \nconstructed in 1790 and Holmes (2000) states that it was common in this period for \nbuildings in Hong Kong to have at least one wall (usually the rear) constructed in \nrammed earth. A good example of traditional southern Chinese village architecture is the \nOld House, built in 1904 and now preserved as an Environmental Resource Centre \n(AMO 2004).  \n \nA depression in China, and the lure of gold mining, led to large migration to California in \nthe mid 19th century. In Fiddletown, California Chinese immigrants constructed a small \nrammed earth herb shop (The Chew Kee Store) around 1850, which was recently \nrepaired to become a museum (Easton 1993; Easton 2007). In Palo Alto, a business \nwoman named Juana Briones built a rammed earth type house around the same time \n(Camarillo 2005). \n \nOn the east coast of the United States a rammed earth construction manual was \npublished in New Jersey (Johnson 1806) which drew heavily on the work of Holland and \nCointeraux.  Johnson built a house near Trenton, New Jersey, hoping to provide a \nmodel to newly arrived Americans looking to settle new farm land.  Tibbets (1989) \nargues that German immigrants built in rammed earth in New York and Pennsylvania, \nand that Thomas Jefferson built his home (Monticello, Virginia) in rammed earth. \nAnother well documented structure, Hilltop House, was constructed in 1773 in \n \nWashington DC. Bushrod Washington (nephew of George Washington) built rammed \nearth lodges on his estate at Mount Vernon in 1812 (Pogue 2007). In 1819 John Stuart \nSkinner, editor of The American Farmer published a translation of Holland\u2019s work, and \nlater several other articles on rammed earth construction experiments taking place in \nNorth America, notably John Hartwell Cocke\u2019s slave quarters at his plantation in Bremo, \nNew Canton, Virginia (Johnston et al. 1969). Dr. William W. Anderson of Stateborough, \nSouth Carolina, recounted his experimentation with rammed earth construction, which \nhad begun with the construction of a small dairy in April 1821. Pleased with the results, \nAnderson constructed rammed earth servants quarters in July 1823. Gilman (1839) \npublished a treatise extolling the virtues of rammed earth, and John Stephen Wright, \neditor of Prairie Farmer published 40 references to rammed earth in this periodical \nbetween 1843 and 1855 (Cody 1990). In 1842 St Thomas Church in Shanty Bay Ontario \nwas built and in 1850 Dr Anderson began the Episcopal Church of the Holy Cross in \nSumter County, South Carolina (Easton 1996). \n \nEuropean settlers in Australasia in the mid 19th century experimented with a wide range \nof building techniques (see Figure 4 for site locations) . The first reference to rammed \nearth may be a notice by the Agricultural Society in May 1823 on the front page of the \nHobart Town Gazette, Tasmania.  \n \n'Resolved that the mode of building in pise, or rammed earth, \nappearing to this Society to be both economical and expeditious, \nthe Society earnestly recommend its adoption in Van Diemen's \nLand' (Moor & Heathcote 2002). \n \nThe Southern Australian reported in 1839 that \u2018nearly thirty houses have been erected, \nthey are mostly built of pise\u2019. In Rushworth, a gold rush town in Victoria, rammed earth \nwas used as a speedy construction technique and in Harden, Australian Capital \nTerritories, a rammed earth barn and stables are now a heritage monument (ACT 2004). \nMuch of the original settler architecture in Oberon (Gemmell-Smith 2004), and Penrith \n(NSWCR 1991) New South Wales was constructed in rammed earth, and though much \n \nhas been demolished, a small number of historic examples remain. On the west coast, \nthe village of Moora contains a large number of rammed earth structures, constructed \nbetween 1847 and 1869 (Laurie 1995). Earth building in New Zealand began with the \nfirst European settlers in 1840, but all forms of masonry construction fell out of favour \nfollowing earthquakes in 1846 and 1855 (Walker & Morris 1997). The best known \nexample of historic rammed earth in New Zealand is Pompallier House in Russell which \nwas completed in 1842 and has recently undergone conservation work (Bowman 2000). \n20th century \nThe two World Wars in the 20th century both saw rammed earth suggested as a solution \nto the housing and labour shortages which followed each war. In the UK following the \nFirst World War, Welsh architect Clough William-Ellis \u2018discovered\u2019 earth buildings hidden \nbeneath plaster veneers of historic cottages. His father-in-law St. Loe Strachey, an \nideologue aristocrat and media mogul, ran a campaign in The Spectator magazine, both \nfor information and to promote rammed earth as a building material in the UK. Following \nthe campaign, William-Ellis published a book (William-Ellis 1919) explaining earth \nbuilding techniques for use in the UK, and the Board of Agriculture constructed a series \nof prototype cottages at Amesbury, Wiltshire, some in rammed earth, others in brick and \nothers in rammed chalk. The rammed earth cottages, while initially popular, did succeed \ndue to the differential costs of labour and materials following the collapse of the post war \nboom (Easton 1996; Swenarton 2003; Walker et al. 2005). \n \nIn the United States Karl Ellington published a book (Ellington 1924) with a preface by \nWilliam-Ellis, and in 1926 Thomas Miller of the US Department of Agriculture was sent to \ninvestigate the Church of the Holy Cross in South Carolina, and as a result published \nFarmers Bulletin No 1500, which detailed rammed earth construction methods. Harry \nBaker Humphrey, a senior member of the Department of Agriculture, was impressed \nwith the technique and built his rammed earth home in 1926. Many others followed suit, \nusing the Farmers Bulletin to construct their own homes in rammed earth.  Academic \nresearch was carried out by Ralph Patty and Henry Delong of South Dakota State \nCollege, with many publications produced for example Patty (1936). As part of President \n \nRoosevelt\u2019s New Deal programme, a number of intentionally labour intensive homestead \nprojects were initiated. In 1932 Thomas Hibben built seven experimental rammed earth \nhouses at Gardendale, Alabama, all of which stand today. Elbert Hubbell, continuing the \nwork of Patty, built a many rammed earth structures on an Indian reservation in North \nDakota, and together with Miller and Hibben, Hubbell conducted tests on a number of \nearth building systems. They published the Building Materials and Structures report \n(BMS78) which concluded that all of the earth building methods tested were suitable for \nthe construction of single or two storey structures (Tibbets 1989; Easton 1996). A single \nreference (Kornouchow 1933) suggests that rammed earth may also have been \ninvestigated in the Soviet Union as a solution to social housing during this period. \n \nFollowing the Second World War, rammed earth was used in East Germany as a cheap \nand widely available construction material for immediate post-war reconstruction \n(Steingass 2005) and Building Standards documents covering rammed earth \nconstruction were published between 1947 and 1956 (Houben and Guillaud 1994). A \nsimilar revival was seen in Scandinavia at the same time with two books on rammed \nearth being published and a number of constructions (Palmgreen 2005). In Australia an \nEnglish trained architect, G F Middleton was employed by the Commonwealth \nExperimental Building Station in Sydney and conducted a large number of tests on \nrammed earth and other earth building techniques. His initial reports (Middleton 1952) \nand his Build Your House of Earth book (Middleton 1953) were until recently the \naccepted standard reference in Australian earth building (Moor and Heathcote 2002). \n \nIn the mid 1970s, a number of different groups began reinvestigating rammed earth, and \nestablished themselves as builders or academics to spread the rammed earth message. \nIn the United States, David Easton and Tom Schmidt began to build in rammed earth, in \nAustralia Giles Hohnen and Stephen Dobson founded companies offering rammed earth \nhomes. Architecture graduates Hugo Houben and Patrice Doat founded CRATerre at \nthe University of Grenoble, for the study of earth building materials. Following those \npioneers, the use of rammed earth has grown and shrunk in different parts of the world, \nbut is now enjoying a growth, and reinvention as a sustainable and environmentally \n \nfriendly building technique. Rammed earth is now a well established construction \ntechnique in Western Australia and the south west United States where cement \nstabilised rammed earth is gaining mainstream use. In Europe and other parts of the \nworld rammed earth is now being suggested as a sustainable construction material.  \nConclusions \nThe discussion above has detailed the development of rammed earth (as defined at the \nstart of this paper) across time and over specified regions. This is summarised in a \ntimeline in Table 1 supplemented by Figure 13 which indicates the most significant \nmovements of rammed earth methods over time. A development of the technique in \nChina was explained, and it is possible that rammed earth developed from the heaping \nof soil against vertical formwork in many parts of the world. Two independent schools \ncan be observed: one around the Mediterranean and one centred on China. \n \nRammed earth in China developed as a necessary construction technique where few \nbuilding materials were available. Yunxiang (2003) shows that heaping of soil may have \ndeveloped into compacting between formwork as a method of producing a vertical face. \nThe technique was successfully used for long sections of defensive walls built by \nsuccessive empires, eventually becoming known as the Great Wall of China. The \ntechnique is certainly used by the Hakka people originally from central China, and may \nhave been used in Tibet. Rammed earth is currently found in southern China as a result \nof Hakka migration, and in the Himalayan kingdoms of Ladakh, Mustang and Bhutan. \n \nRammed earth around the Mediterranean appears to be present in Phoenician and later \nCarthaginian settlements, such as those of Hannibal described by Pliny and Healy \n(1991). This appears to be independent from the rammed earth technique practiced by \nthe \u2018oasis dwellers\u2019 of north Africa\u2019 described by Michon (1990). The explosion of Islam \nin the 8th century led to the second introduction of rammed earth into Europe, this time \nfrom north Africa, and many rammed earth fortifications in southern Spain are a result of \nthis spread. Evidence in Central Asia is scarce, rammed earth is found in Penjikent in \nTajikistan, dated to the 5th century, and rammed earth walls at Yerevan in Armenia exist, \n \nbut the date of their construction is unknown. Muslim technology and architecture \nspread east with the armies, but it is probable that rammed earth already existed in \ncentral Asia prior to this.  \n \nThere is no evidence of rammed earth in the Americas or Australasia prior to European \nsettlement, even though rammed earth is now flourishing in those parts of the world. 16th \ncentury migration took the technique from Spain and Portugal to South America. 18th \nand 19th century migrants to North America and Australasia tried rammed earth amongst \na wide range of building techniques, and a small number of historic examples have been \nhighlighted. Chinese migration to the west coast of north America may have been \nresponsible for the Chew Kee store in California (Easton 1996). \n \nRammed earth use in Europe was revitalised by the publications of Cointeraux, and \ntranslations of his work helped to spread the message far.  In the 20th century rammed \nearth was again revived as a solution to the housing and labour shortages following \neach World War. Recently rammed earth has once again seen a revival in interest, this \ntime as a sustainable building material.  \n \nRammed earth is not a ubiquitous construction technique, instead finding niches in \ndifferent parts of the world. Rammed earth is found only where certain criteria are \nfulfilled. The building material, namely soil, must be suitable, and the wide range of \ndifferent suitable soils is testament to different mixtures which can be used. If a soil is \npredominantly clay, then it is more likely that moulded sun dried clay bricks will be \nmade. If the soil is too sandy, then any attempt to make rammed earth will ultimately fail. \nThe availability of timber is paramount. If timber is freely available, then it will be used \nfor construction, but formwork cannot be produced if it is wholly absent. The climate in \nwhich rammed earth will survive is the source of much debate. Rammed earth is found \nin regions with a Mediterranean climate, which includes western Australia and the south \nwest United States.  \n \n \nThis paper has provided a chronological account of rammed earth in different locations \naround the world. Monumental architecture has been used as references, and it is \nassumed that vernacular rammed earth existed where monumental rammed earth is \nfound. It may be likely that rammed earth may be discovered at sites not yet \ninvestigated, but the fragile nature of rammed earth means that many sites may no \nlonger exist.  \n \nRammed earth has been used for the quick construction of fortifications, and is used \nwhere few other building materials are available. Rammed earth flourishes where labour \nis comparatively cheap, and has repeatedly been proposed as a solution for owner-\nbuilder construction. Most recently rammed earth has been suggested as a sustainable \nbuilding technique, and it is hoped that the rich heritage of historic sites are able to \ninform modern construction. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAaberg-J\u00f8rgensen, J. 2000.
