Introduction\nA recent review highlighted that a key research priority for managers and academics alike is\n\u201ccreating and enhancing tools for capturing value in use for services and communicating value to\ncustomers\u201d (Ostrom et al., 2010: 26). Understanding what customers value has long been a\nchallenge: \u201cgaining a comprehensive understanding of the value of a market offering in a particular\ncustomer setting may appear monumentally difficult\u201d (Anderson & Narus, 1998: 55). In\ndiscussions of value, there has been an increasing recognition (e.g. Moller, 2006; Vargo & Lusch,\n2004, 2008a) of the importance of value created through the customer\u2019s own processes and\/or\njointly created between the customer and supplier. Moller (2006) observed that, until recently, the\nperceived value literature has been largely silent about joint value creation requiring the combined\nactivities of the buyer and the seller. This share of voice has, however, been only relative\n(Normann & Ramirez, 1993; Dorsch, Swanson & Kelley,2001), and in recent years, Vargo and\nLusch\u2019s (2004) service-dominant logic (SDL) along with the work other scholars (Woodruff &\nFlint, 2006; Payne, Storbacka & Frow, 2008; Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004) have reminded\nmarketers that the customer is always a co-creator of value who co-creates value \u2018in use\u2019, as\nopposed to value being embedded in tangible goods at the factory gate.\nValue has several meanings in the management literature, with a frequent focus on profit at the\nexpense of other possible contributions to value that relationships can make (Walter, Ritter &\nGemunden, 2001). While Walter et al. (2001) point out that understanding value creation from a\nprovider\u2019s perspective is important, other work has examined the customer\u2019s perspective (Woodruff\nand Gardial, 1996). For example, the value-added concept allows sellers to think of bundles of\nPage 6 of 48\nattributes and seller-controlled variables (Woodruff & Flint, 2006). While SDL literature has\nhighlighted the significance of customer perceived value-in-use (or value-in-context, as per Vargo,\nMaglio & Akaka, 2008), this strand of scholarship has as yet neither defined this term nor proposed\nhow it can be assessed. Building on Vargo and Lusch (2004, 2008a) as well as Woodruff (1997)\nand Woodruff and Flint (2007), we define value-in-use as a customer\u2019s outcome, purpose or\nobjective that is achieved through service. We adopt in turn Vargo and Lusch\u2019s (2004, 2008a)\ndefinition of service as the provider\u2019s process of using its resources for the benefit of the customer.1\nWe propose that value-in-use provides a missing link between service quality on the one hand and\nrelationship outcomes on the other. Consistent with the SDL argument, we argue that a value-in-use\nperspective is superior to the embedded value perspective which, building on the same authors, may\nbe defined as: the presence of service attributes, and performances against those attributes, for\nwhich the customer is prepared to pay.\nDiscussions of value are perhaps particularly prominent in discourse on business-to-business\ncontexts. As \u2018servitization\u2019 (Vandermerwe & Rada, 1988) pervades manufacturing, providers are\nchallenged to assess the perceived value that \u2018integrated solutions\u2019 deliver (Jacob & Ulaga, 2008).\nSolutions are defined by Evanschitzky, Wangenheim and Woisetschl\u00e4ger (2011, this issue) as\n\u201cindividualized offers for complex customer problems that are interactively designed and whose\ncomponents offer an integrative added value by combining products and\/or services so that the\nvalue is more than the sum of the components.\u201d If some felt that value propositions delivered\npurely through the appliance of physical goods could be assessed at the factory gate according to\nthe goods-dominant logic of embedded value (Vargo & Lusch, 2004), the notion of a solution\n1 We note that these definitions do not imply that the \u2018use\u2019 of \u2018value-in-use\u2019 is necessarily a customer\u2019s usage process\nsubsequent to service (that is, processes making use of jus usus fructus, the right to appropriate the returns arising from\nexploiting the provider\u2019s resources, as Haase and Kleinaltenkamp (2011) delineate it in their application of new\ninstitutional economics to service-dominant logic). Rather, it may equally refer to the resource integration process\nthrough which the customer integrates supplier resources with customer resources or others available to the customer in\nthe context of the customer\u2019s goals, thereby utilising the customer\u2019s right of jus usus, the right simply to use the\nprovider\u2019s resources. Hence the proposal by Vargo, Maglio and Akaka (2008) to adopt instead the term \u2018value-in-\ncontext\u2019. With this clarification, we believe the terms are interchangeable.\nPage 7 of 48\nclarifies the need to assess value that arises in the customer\u2019s space and through the customer\u2019s\nusage processes (Baines et al., 2007). Yet it is an assessment required by increasing numbers of\nmanufacturers who may previously have given it little thought; for fifty-eight percent of US\nmanufacturers, tangible goods now form only part of the value proposition, and this hybrid\napproach is growing across other developed nations, though its impact on profits is mixed (Neely,\n2008). Marketing discourse increasingly therefore focuses on utilization (Gummesson, 1995;\nLindgreen & Wynstra, 2005; Ngo & O\u2019Cass, 2009).\nWhile Vargo and Lusch (2008a) position their contribution as a positive rather than a normative\none, their highlighting, along with other scholars, of the customer\u2019s contribution as a co-creator of\nvalue suggests that a shift is required in how organizations elicit value sought by and derived by\ncustomers in their customer insight processes (Vargo & Lusch, 2006). In this paper, we ask the\nquestion: How does a business customer assess value-in-use? Combining means-end theory\n(Woodruff, 1997), work on co-creation (Payne et al., 2008), and definitional work on value (Vargo\n& Lusch, 2004; Woodruff & Flint, 2006), we propose a conceptual framework which relates service\nquality, usage process quality, and value-in-use. We explore this framework in a factory\nmaintenance context to ask how customers assess the value-in-use arising from a provider\u2019s service\nat inception and as the relationship continues over time. We adopt a critical realist perspective\nwhich allows the use of causal language and is \u201cparticularly well-suited as a companion to case\nresearch\u201d (Easton 2010: 119). Epistemologically, this perspective justifies the use of a single case\nprovided the process involves thoughtful in-depth research with the objective of understanding why\nthings are as they are. The single-case analysis presented in this paper identifies the key\nmechanisms for customer assessment of value in a business-to-business context and over time. The\nfindings provide some initial validation and refinement of our proposed framework for value-in-use\nassessment.\nPage 8 of 48\nSpecifically, we make contributions in four respects. First, we argue that current service quality\nmeasures are insufficient for understanding customer value, because to use them in isolation as\ndrivers of relationship outcomes would be to assume that value is embedded at the moment of\nservice delivery, which following Vargo & Lusch (2004) we argue to be incorrect. Second, we\ndemonstrate that the customer can articulate both the constructs by which they assess value-in-use\nand the causal chain by which they perceive value-in-use to be related to service quality. Third, we\ndemonstrate that customers can also articulate usage process quality and how it contributes to value-\nin-use. Fourth, we explore how perceptions of value evolve in the B2B space, tentatively proposing\nthat the value-in-use sought tends to shift from preventative goals to promotional goals as the\nformer are satisfied. We conclude by suggesting implications for practitioners\u2019 customer insight\nprocesses, and proposing some research directions.\n2. Approaches to the assessment of customer perceived value\nAlthough the potential of value-in-use for understanding the customer\u2019s world is widely recognised\nconceptually (Flint & Mentzer 2006; Vargo & Lusch 2004; 2008a; Vargo, Lusch & Morgan, 2006;\nWoodruff, 1997), it is still \u201cin its research infancy\u201d (Ostrom et al., 2010: 26). It is not yet clear how\nto operationalize it or relate it to the perceived excellence or superiority, to use Zeithaml\u2019s (1988)\ndefinition of quality, of a provider\u2019s value proposition. In working towards this goal we will start\nby considering existing measures of quality.\nThe original manufacturing management conceptions of quality were relatively straightforward\n(Ulaga, 2003). Quality was seen as a comparison of customer perceptions of tangible goods\nattributes against expectations, and was regarded as signalled through marketing communications\n(Zeithaml, 1988; Kirmani & Rao, 2000). For value propositions not delivered exclusively through\nthe appliance of tangible goods, SERVQUAL and its variants took a similar stance of measuring\nPage 9 of 48\nconformance to customer expectations (Zeithaml, Berry & Parasuraman, 1996). This generation of\nservice quality research broke new ground in acknowledging that this judgement of excellence or\nsuperiority was ultimately perceptual rather than objective, but shared with earlier quality work the\nemphasis on the moment of interaction between customer and provider (Parasuraman, Zeithaml &\nBerry, 1988). Just as Vargo and Lusch (2004) argued that value is not created at the factory gate,\nthe service quality literature stream has been criticised for not focusing on the outcomes of a service\nencounter (Buttle, 1996); that is, service quality does not assess value-in-use as we have defined it.\nIn particular, it ignores customer processes which may contribute to value co-creation, such as: (a)\nusage processes (Vargo & Lusch, 2004) which may occur subsequent to the provider\u2019s delivery\nprocess, as in the case of learning on an MBA program being applied in a student\u2019s subsequent\ncareer; (b) experience co-creation by the customer (Payne et al., 2008; Lusch, Vargo & O\u2019Brien,\n2007); and (c) the contribution to value creation of other customers (Diamond, Sherry, Muniz,\nMcGrath, Kozinets & Borghini, 2009) and other resource providers (McColl-Kennedy, Vargo,\nDagger & Sweeney, 2009). Partly because of these limitations, SERVQUAL has been modified in\nsome sectors, such as information systems (Kettinger and Lee, 1994).\nA further critique of service quality research has taken a relationship perspective. For instance, the\nAmerican Society for Quality (ASQ, previously ASQC) shifted from defining quality as \u201cthe\ntotality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated\nor implied needs\" (ANSI\/ASQC, 1987) to a relationally focused, processual definition as \u201cthe\nongoing process of building and sustaining relationships by assessing, anticipating, and fulfilling\nstated and implied needs\u201d (Judd, 1994). Several studies have shown that customers can and do\nmake judgements about the quality of their relationships with suppliers (e.g. Ballantyne & Varey,\n2006a; Storbacka, Strandvik & Gronroos, 1994; Ulaga & Eggert, 2006). Tuli, Kohli and Bharadwaj\n(2007) found that while providers tended to take a goods-centric view of customer solutions,\ndefining a customer solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and services for\nPage 10 of 48\nmeeting a customer\u2019s business needs, customers took a relational process view of solutions,\nemphasising requirements definition and post-deployment support \u2013 both of which pertain to the\ncustomer\u2019s usage processes as well as the service directly provided by the provider.\nIn summary, while these critiques do not invalidate service quality as a useful measure of the\nsupplier\u2019s contribution to value creation, a more holistic assessment of value-in-use would need to\nconsider also: i) The role of the customer\u2019s usage process in value creation; ii) The extent to which\nthe customer\u2019s intended outcomes are achieved \u2013 that is, the customer\u2019s value-in-use; and iii) The\nrole of the supplier-customer relationship in defining what the supplier\u2019s contribution is to be,\nincluding the supplier\u2019s support for the customer\u2019s own usage processes. We next synthesise this\nargument into a framework for assessing value-in-use.\n3. A means-ends framework for assessing value-in-use\nFigure 1 shows our conceptual framework for value-in-use assessment, which builds on Woodruff\u2019s\ncustomer value hierarchy perspective (1997).\n--------------------------------------------\nPlace Figure 1 Here\n--------------------------------------------\nVargo and Lusch\u2019s (2004) call to view tangible goods as \u2018appliances\u2019 for service delivery has been\nechoed in the co-creation work of Payne et al. (2008) who reiterate that service should be viewed as\na flexible process, not the provision of static entities. This notion \u2013 in combination with our\ndefinition of value-in-use earlier \u2013 implies that customers\u2019 use of a provider\u2019s service is goal-\ndirected. In a review of customer behavior, Bagozzi (1997) observed that the transaction-related\nPage 11 of 48\nprocesses of buying and selling are goal-directed behaviors. However, recent work brings to the\nfore the importance of usage (Moller, 2006; Vargo and Lusch, 2004). We consider the usage\nprocess as a purposeful, goal-directed behavior which, like service quality and relationship quality,\nis susceptible to the customer\u2019s quality assessment.\nWoodruff articulated the means-end approach for capturing an understanding of customer value\n(Woodruff, 1997; Woodruff & Gardial, 1996). Means-end laddering theory (e.g. Kelly, 1963;\nGutman, 1982) suggests that individuals, both as consumers and as members of a buying center,\nhave networks of goals comprising multiple levels. Individuals have goals regarding their own\nactions and goals regarding the outcomes of their actions (Gutman, 1997). Consistent with their\nladders of goals, individuals view provider offerings from different perspectives across a hierarchy\nof goals (Peterman, 1997; Rugg, Mahmood, Rehman, Andrews & Davies,2002). While originally\ndeveloped for understanding consumer behaviour, means-end theory has been used for explaining\nbehaviour of managers in customer value creation (Guenzi & Troilo, 2006) and sales process\nmanagement (Deeter-Schmelz, Kennedy & Goebel, 2002). We are not the first to have observed\nthat the value perceived by B2B customers has multiple levels (for example, Rugg et al., 2002; van\nder Haar, Kemp & Omta, 2001). Both Guenzi and Troilo (2006) and Rugg et al. (2002) in a\nbusiness context find that customers hold multiple levels of knowledge across the following range\nof goals, which can be thought of as going up a value hierarchy: (a) beliefs that relate to provider\nattributes or features; (b) subjective benefits; and (c) consistencies with personal values. The\ncustomer relates these levels with a mental map hypothesising causal links between these goals. In\na B2B context goals may be individual or organisational. Customers may move back and forth\nbetween these in either direction, so an IT solution may be viewed as making me more efficient at\nmy job (individual), helping my organisation maintain its competitive advantage (organisational),\nand increasing my job security (individual) (Rugg et al., 2002).\nPage 12 of 48\nGoal theory suggests a plausible explanation for the gap in understanding of value between\ncustomers and providers of \u2018solutions\u2019 (Paulssen & Bagozzi, 2006): namely, that providers fail to\nrecognise the importance of customer value perceptions at multiple levels and, particularly, the\nimportance of higher level customer goals (Rugg et al., 2002). A plausible reading of Tuli et al.\u2019s\n(2007) data is that providers\u2019 assessment of value tends to be attribute centric, focusing at the lower\nend of the hierarchy, whether because of a goods-dominant logic assumption that value creation\noccurs at the factory gate, or because this level is easier to measure. Importantly, we have argued\nthat the notion of service quality is often equally obsessed with what the provider delivers, as\nopposed to the value the customer gets. Insufficient effort has been put into specifying how\ncustomers select and strive for goals (Bagozzi, 1997; Botschen, Thelen & Pieters, 1999). We\nsuggest, therefore, that in order to effectively elicit a customer\u2019s assessment of value-in-use,\ncustomer perceptions need to be measured up as well as down the hierarchy of customer goals.\nThe implication of goal theory for value assessment is that providers cannot assume that customers\u2019\nvalue assessments are made at a single level, nor with regards purely to provider attributes or\nfeatures (Locke & Latham, 2002). Providers must also allow for assessments made at multiple\nlevels and at increasing levels of the value hierarchy including at the level of subjective benefits.\nOur framework takes direction from these hierarchical goal perspectives. Customers evaluate both\nservice quality and value-in-use: indeed, their goal hierarchy includes a mental model as to how\nthese levels relate. The customer is prepared to pay for the presence of certain attributes not because\nthey exceed expectations (Zeithaml et al., 1996) but because of their association with higher goals\nin the customer\u2019s mental model.\nPrecisely the same reasoning applies to usage processes. If the customer co-creates value through\ninteraction with the provider and other customers, then we would expect the customer\u2019s mental\nPage 13 of 48\nmodel to include these usage processes, and their hypothesised relationship to value-in-use in the\ngoal hierarchy. The customer\u2019s evaluation of the usage process could be expected to possess a\nvalence or direction in the same way as the customer\u2019s evaluation of the provider\u2019s service. That is,\nusage process quality exists and furthermore, there would appear to be no theoretical reason why it\ncannot be empirically elucidated.\nThe final element of our framework is relationship quality (Crosby, Evans & Cowles, 1990; Dorsch,\nSwanson & Kelley, 1998). We conceptualize relationship, following Morgan and Hunt (1994), as\nan ongoing process of interaction involving one or more value exchanges. In the light of Vargo and\nLusch\u2019s (2004) conceptualization of value exchanges, we can hence see relationship as an inter-\norganizational capability (Trist, 1983) by which exchange partners identify value-in-use sought,\nconstruct a value proposition, and assess service quality and value-in-use achieved; and relationship\nquality is the perceived excellence or superiority of this capability. Our conceptualization is\nconsistent with that of ASQC which we discussed earlier, but adds clarity in the conceptualization\nof needs as the value-in-use sought.\nWe note that the framework does not assume that value-in-use sought by the customer remains\nconstant through the relationship; this would be inconsistent with the phenomenological definitions\nof quality and value-in-use. The customer\u2019s assessment of value-in-use forms a cognitive map\nwhich may evolve over time (Huff, 1990). Equally, we do not assume that members of a buying\ngroup will share the same cognitive map.\nDespite the array of techniques available for assessing the quality of supplier controlled processes,\nour empirical research (reported below) is consistent with the pressing practitioner need for more\nholistic customer insight measures (Ostrom et al., 2010). The goods-dominant perspective is\ninadequate for explaining the role of customers in deploying their own resources in creative ways to\nPage 14 of 48\nderive value-in-use from a provider\u2019s service that varies from that intended by the firm (Arnould,\nPrice & Malshe, 2006) and it is not consistent with an increasing shift towards a continuous-process\nperspective where the customer\u2019s role as co-creator is recognised (Vargo & Lusch, 2004, 2006).\n4. Method\nOur conceptual framework (Figure 1) conjectures that business customers possess and can articulate\na mental model relating provider-controlled attributes and their own use processes to value-in-use.\nWe explore this framework through an interview-based case study in a maintenance context.\n4.1 Case selection\nIndustrial maintenance is a context in which some emerging practices subvert traditional models of\nownership and exchange (Tukker & Tischner, 2006). In this environment, customers struggle with\nassessment of value in propositions such as Rolls Royce\u2019s \u2018Power by the hour\u2019 which sees them\nyielding power, control and expertise to the provider while simultaneously achieving greater\norganizational efficiencies (Baines et al., 2007). In this case the provider, traditionally a\nmanufacturer of factory equipment, had recently shifted to providing an \u2018outsourced maintenance\nservice\u2019 (OMS) for manufacturing plants. This proposition involves a fully managed maintenance\nprogram including provision of factory equipment, parts procurement\/repairs, and third-party\nsupplier management, administered by a service professional (SP) located full-time at the customer\nsite.2 As well as employing the on-site SP, the provider takes on some risk through a business\n2 The outsourced maintenance program allows the provider to push their own-branded tangible goods but has a proportionally\ngreater emphasis on procurement and management of third party services from multiple suppliers.\nPage 15 of 48\nmodel which takes a preventative approach to maintenance and assures the customer of savings.\nThe proposition is unusual in its comprehensiveness and in the level of partnership it embodies\nwhich, at least in the selling stages, is offered and sold at a very senior level within the customer\norganization.\nThe selected customer organisation was the first company to purchase this innovative offering and\nits managers were well placed to reflect on any evolution of value over time from its four years of\nexperience with it. For this organization, an engine manufacturer, maintenance is an essential but\nnon-core function that ensures factory production lines continue running productively.\n4.2 Data collection\nA goal hierarchy is a form of cognitive map (Huff, 1990). To understand corporate decision making\nit is necessary to explore these maps for multiple individuals (Langfield-Smith, 1992; Larson &\nChristensen, 1993) and across multiple functions including decision makers and users (Qualls &\nRosa, 1995; Johnston, Leach & Liu, 1999). An initial interview with a key decision-maker defined\nthe buying group, which was confirmed by interviewees subsequently. This buying group\ncomprised four key decision-makers - operations manager, maintenance manager, factory manager\nand commercial manager - and four users (representing a subset of the total OMS user pool). The\nresearch protocol allowed for exploration to establish (a) what the customer believed the provider\nintended as their value proposition, (b) the process of provider selection and assessment, (c) the\ncustomer\u2019s assessment of value over time, and (d) what performance measures were used to assess\nproviders.\nPage 16 of 48\nAt three stages during the research, input was sought from managers in the provider to discuss the\nresearchers\u2019 emerging understanding. Interim findings were presented to representatives of the\nprovider\u2019s sales team and implications for the provider\u2019s value proposition were discussed.\n4.3 Data analysis\nData was collected to explore the proposed framework (Figure 1). An analytical reflection of the\ntranscribed interviews was carried out through the identification of patterns (Cassel & Symon,\n1990). The key themes in the a priori framework related to service quality, relationship quality,\nusage process quality, peer-to-peer interaction quality, and value-in-use. The coding process\nallowed for the emergence of additional themes: this occurred for \u2018network quality\u2019, further\ndescribed below. One proposed theme \u2013 peer-to-peer interaction quality \u2013 attracted no data and was\ndisbanded suggesting that it was not significant in the goal hierarchy for this customer. The\nmajority of the data was coded by one researcher with \u2018member checks\u2019 (Woodside, 2010)\nconducted by a second researcher.\nIt became apparent that all interviewees perceived two time periods with distinct value perceptions:\nan early \u201cintroduction\u201d period and a recent \u201ccurrent\u201d period. The early period (referred to as Year\n1 below) roughly corresponds with introduction up to month 12 of the customer\u2019s usage of the\noffering, while the later period (labelled Year 4) corresponds roughly with months 37 to 48. The\ntwo time periods appeared linked in the minds of interviewees with the on-site SP involved: \u2018Year\n1\u2019 corresponds with the term of the inaugural on-site SP who had since moved on, while \u2018Year 4\u2019\ncorresponds with his replacement. Hence, data was synthesised across the buying group for Year 1\n(Table 1) and Year 4 (Table 2) and then summarised against the value-in-use framework. By\nPage 17 of 48\nsynthesising across the buying group for simplicity, granularity may be lost with respect to\ndifferences in perceptions across the buying group; we offer this point as a topic for future research.\n5. Case study description\nWe now provide an exposition of the case study data, including background for judging boundary\nconditions (Beverland & Lindgreen, 2010; Stake, 1995), to tell the story of the OMS and its value\nassessment at Year 1 (Figure 2) and Year 4 (Figure 3).\n5.1 The introduction of the outsourced maintenance offering\nThe customer has a long heritage in manufacturing industrial engines. Five years ago, managers\ninvestigated outsourcing of the maintenance function, essential for keeping production lines going,\nbut which at the time seemed highly unstructured: \u201cchallenging,\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cdreadful.\u201d\nHowever, managers had struggled for several years with how to improve it. It had in turn \u201cbeen\ncentralized, decentralized. It was pretty grim.\u201d Breakdowns were common with some machine\nlines achieving only 35% overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) - \u201cand that\u2019s just outrageous.\u201d\nMaintenance was \u201cin excess of 90% reactive\u201d, yet staff thought they were doing an effective job\nbecause they were good at \u201cfire fighting.\u201d\nManagers were concerned with the amount of time spent reacting and the lack of planning: \u201cnobody\never sat back and thought about how you do this.\u201d Supervisors were spending time finding\nsuppliers, obtaining quotations and chasing parts, and little time on \u201cthe preventative stuff, the\nvisionary stuff, trying to do the planning, the preparation and delivering projects.\u201d\nPage 18 of 48\nAfter considering several providers, the customer engaged the case study provider to give a more\nproactive approach to maintenance. The provider was the only one that offered to place a\npermanent SP on-site. The provider would source, supply and repair third party equipment as well\nas its own branded equipment. Additionally, the provider\u2019s size and global reach meant it would\nbring a \u201cfull size inventory\u201d of parts and \u201cmarket clout\u201d to purchasing.\nOnce the program was in place, it highlighted problems elsewhere. Notably, managers found that\nfactory stores were disorganised and inefficient: \u201cIt was like a scrap yard and so we were throwing\ngood stuff away because we didn\u2019t know that it worked.\u201d The problem was compounded by the\nexistence of individual \u201csquirrel stores\u201d so, for example, after waiting for a part for one week \u201ca\nguy would come in from holiday and say, oh, I\u2019ve got twenty of those in my cupboard.\u201d The\nprovider was hence asked to add stores management to its maintenance responsibilities.\n5.2 Immediate impacts\nThe customer found that the offering was being used more than expected and the impact was\nvisible. Repairs were taking only ten minutes of factory supervisors\u2019 time, it was recalled, instead\nof days. \u201cIt suddenly freed up all the guys and it was great, that enabled us to then start talking\nabout the things that we should be doing upstream to get TPM [Total Preventative Maintenance]\nsorted.\u201d Stores management was also positively perceived. Once the provider had bar-coded all\nitems in the stores, the improvement was \u201cfantastic\u201d: \u201cWe found something like 1.2 million dollars\nworth of obsolete stock that was just rubbish \u2013 in cupboards, under desks.\u201d\n5.3 The customer\u2019s role in co-creating value\nPage 19 of 48\nThe customer organization was perceived as contributing to improved performance on-site through\nthe introduction of new processes and training. Staff were trained in the use of more proactive\nmaintenance processes and in the use of the now provider-run stores. The success of the new\napproach was perceived as being due also to the customer organization taking responsibility for\nimprovements. For instance, one manager described a conversation where one of his factory\nsupervisors was \u201cdemotivated\u201d because he needed $140,000 in spare parts to make his section\nperform better. The manager approved the bulk purchase under the following conditions: \u201cHere\u2019s\nthe deal, I will buy you this stuff, I expect you to look after it, maintain it, get it in the stores, label\nit.\u201d The result was that the area, previously running at 35% OEE, was now \u201ca hell of a machine\ntool line, it\u2019s now doing 85% OEE \u2013 every day currently, every single day.\u201d\nA key component in this initial success was thought to be the close working with the provider\u2019s SP:\n\u201cI didn't treat him as a service provider, I treated him as one of my team. He sat in the same office\nwith my first line. Every day he spoke to them. If there was a problem I would go and talk to him.\nHe came to our team meetings.\u201d The closeness of these individuals continued despite the SP and\nmanagers moving onto different roles more recently. In more recent times, some managers\nquestioned their organization\u2019s role in monitoring the OMS: \u201cWe have become a little bit\ncomplacent ... the KPIs aren\u2019t as good or robust as they should be\u2026we have perhaps let this die a\nlittle bit and that worries me a bit.\u201d\n5.4 Importance of the individual service provider\nThe contrast between the service provided by the original SP and his subsequent replacement\nhighlighted the importance of this appointment. The original SP seemed to work very well with\nmanagers and developed a good relationship with factory floor supervisors: \u201cOne of the benefits\nthat became obvious to us, we had a great guy doing the job.\u201d He was widely respected for being\nPage 20 of 48\n\u201con the ball with most things\u201d. Several comments were made, though, by both decision makers and\nusers about the contrast in service quality since the original SP had shifted to a more senior position.\nThe replacement SP appeared less responsive and less knowledgeable (contrast the quotes in Table\n1 with Table 2).\n5.5 Assessing the value of outsourced maintenance\nA comparison of value-in-use identified in Year 1 (Figure 2) and Year 4 (Figure 3) highlights that\nefficiency, asset maximisation, asset control and time for core business were explicitly stated for\nYear 1 but not Year 4 although these presumably would have continued to be germane. Most\nlikely, the customer felt that these value-in-use dimensions were already being achieved. There is\nsome support for this explanation in the observation that despite the concerns raised by several\nstudy participants, the solution was renewed into a fifth year.\nManagers believed that by Year 4, they had \u201cturned around\u201d maintenance. However, following the\ninitial significant improvement, managers observed that it was difficult to quantify the incremental\nvalue from the continuing cost of the OMS. One commented that: \u201cgenerally, it\u2019s a system that\u2019s\nbubbling along at a level that I just don\u2019t see anymore.\u201d The provider seemed to be finding it\nharder now to demonstrate value. Several changes in key personnel had compounded this difficulty\nincluding: (a) senior customer managers moving into different roles; (b) as noted earlier, the\noriginal SP had been promoted away; and (c) the current SP was no longer co-located with the\ncustomer\u2019s management team but sat in his own space on site, which meant that he - and\nconsequently other provider managers - risked being disconnected from the everyday concerns of\nthe customer\u2019s business.\nPage 21 of 48\nThe standard by which the provider was assessed seemed to have shifted upwards. One manager\nreported that the provider was \u201cgood at the mundane, rudimentary, tick-over stuff but not good at\ninnovation.\u201d There was also a concern that having become established, the provider had \u201crelaxed\u201d\nand lost \u201cpassion.\u201d This comment from another manager (previously a champion of the outsourced\nservice) reflected the current view of the provider: \u201cDo I see them as such a valued asset?\nProbably not at the moment. I still see them as providing us with a good service, but probably the\nfocus has gone a little bit away. I believe that [the provider] now probably have taken it that it\u2019s a\ngiven thing that they\u2019ll be on site here, probably the emphasis has gone away from providing such a\nquality service to be honest.\u201d\nRelationship quality assessments featured significantly in the Year 4 evaluations of the provider.\nCommunication was a key issue, with complaints that the provider should be more explicit about\ntheir impact through reporting (see Table 2). The Year 4 picture indicated some mistrust about the\ncommitment of the provider to meeting the customer\u2019s needs. The current relationship was\ndescribed as \u201cOK, but not great.\u201d There are multiple potential explanations for why relationship\nquality was assessed so differently and poorly at this later stage, for instance: (a) the replacement of\nthe original SP with a different individual between Year 1 and Year 4, (b) the second SP appeared\nnot to have tried as hard to embed himself at both senior management and operational levels of the\ncustomer organisation, (c) but even if he been successful in achieving the same level of\nembeddedness, perhaps differences in personal style \u2013 or even a personality clash - could have\ncreated similar deterioration in perceived relationship quality over time. The data are not\nconclusive on this point.\nIn both time periods, the customer\u2019s usage process quality was reflected upon, with a recognition\nthat the customer needed to do its part in extracting value. Greater degrees of scrutiny were\napplied to internal processes within the customer organisation in Year 4 than in Year 1 with\nPage 22 of 48\nassessments tending towards the negative (Figure 2 versus Figure 1). While agreeing that usage\nprocess quality had deteriorated, there were differences in the explanations that were offered. For\ninstance, one manager observed that his organization had weaknesses in providing information to\nthe provider that was useful to their processes, such as production forecasting (which might point to\nweaknesses in outsourcing capabilities). Several managers and floor supervisors believed there was\na lack of regular analysis (see Table 2).\nIn terms of overall value assessment, while outsourced maintenance had helped to streamline\nprocesses, it had not been without sacrifice, notably a perceived loss of knowledge and expertise\nwithin the customer organization (see Table 2). Also, communication was less direct and: \u201cless\nefficient somehow - the number of people that we\u2019re having to speak to, the communication\nchannels are longer. Inevitably you get Chinese whispers.\u201d\nIt seemed, then, that the value sought by the customer changed with time. Broadly, respondents\nrecalled an initial quality assessment from what the provider\u2019s sales manager referred to as the\n\u201choneymoon\u201d period, as summarised in Figure 2 and Table 1, and articulated a contemporaneous\nquality assessment in the later period of the engagement, summarised in Figure 3 and Table 2. The\nprovider was perceived as having done well in satisfying the initial goals, but not so well in noticing\nthe customer\u2019s additional goals over time: \u201cThey are not hungry enough. They should kick down\nthe door and dazzle me. Am I unreasonable? No, I am demanding.\u201d The assessment of provider\nprocesses, customer usage process and value-in-use was on the whole more negative in Year 4.\nWhile value-in-use in Year 1 was assessed at both organization and individual levels, it was\nassessed solely at an organizational level in Year 4, possibly as a result of interviewees rationalising\ntheir complaints.\nPage 23 of 48\n5.6 Provider response\nAs a result of this research the provider implemented changes to re-establish intimacy with the\ncustomer. The onsite SP was encouraged to \u201cget out of his office more\u201d and his role was\nsupplemented with a technical analyst to work closely with the customer management team.\nThe impact of the OMS on the customer\u2019s business following initial implementation had been\ndramatic. However, later when the effects were less evident, additional reporting was called for.\nNot realising this, the provider admitted \u201cthrowing\u201d resources into relationship building activities in\nYear 1 and then \u201ctook a step back from it in Year 2.\u201d Resulting from this study the provider\ndetermined that in future greater attention should be given to reinforcing the value delivered at each\nperiod of time in acknowledgement that perceptions of value-in-use evolve over time. Despite the\nless than positive evaluations described at Year 4, the contract was renewed into Year 5.\n--------------------------------------------\nPlace Table 1 Here\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\nPlace Table 2 Here\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\nPlace Figure 2 Here\n--------------------------------------------\nPage 24 of 48\n--------------------------------------------\nPlace Figure 3 Here\n--------------------------------------------\n6. Discussion\nOur analysis of customer perceptions of quality and value shows that customers can - independently\nand without prompting - articulate their quality perceptions of provider processes. In the case\nstudy, customers articulated dimensions of service quality (including at the provider organization\nand individual SP level) and relationship quality (again at the levels of organization and individual).\nAdditionally, our research indicates that customers can provide an assessment of the quality of their\nown usage processes (discussed below). Furthermore, our research indicates that customers can\narticulate the value-in-use derived in terms of goal-related constructs (also discussed below).\nAn emergent theme was that customers assess the network quality of the provider: that is, the\nprovider\u2019s strength in accessing and making use of other suppliers. In this manner, the provider acts\nnot only as a resource provider to the customer but also as a resource integrator (McColl-Kennedy\net al., 2009). If customers, too, are resource integrators, one of the tasks they can choose to\noutsource is some of this resource integration. The customer\u2019s decision to sign up the provider in\nthis case thus involved redrawing much of the customer\u2019s network (Gummesson, 2006; Normann &\nRamirez, 1993). This echoes Vargo, et al.\u2019s (2008: 149) coining of the term \u2018value-in-context\u2019,\nwhich they discuss as: \u201cimprovement in system well-being and we can measure value in terms of a\nsystem\u2019s adaptiveness or ability to fit in its environment\u201d. While we define value-in-use in terms of\nthe customer\u2019s goals, purposes or objectives, it arises from a variety of resources within the\ncustomer\u2019s network, or the system within which the customer resides, including not just those\nPage 25 of 48\ndirectly provided by the provider and the customer but also those provided by other actors in a\nconfiguration which the provider-customer relationship may influence.\nBased on our conceptualization and the findings from this exploratory study, we make four key\npropositions in the subsections which follow.\n6.1 The need for new quality measures\nDespite Woodruff\u2019s (1997: 149) identification of the need for companies wanting to \u201ccompete...on\nsuperior customer value delivery\u201d to improve their \u201ccustomer learning and translation processes [as\na] core competency issue\u201d, and the increasingly widespread discussion of the contention that value\nis created \u201cin use\u201d (Vargo & Lusch, 2006, 2008a), the predominant measures of quality continue to\nignore co-creation processes. For instance, none of the five SERVQUAL dimensions of tangibility,\nreliability, responsiveness, assurance or empathy relates to customer co-created value\n(Parasuraman, et al., 1988). Performance measures play a key role in organizational learning\n(Sinkula, Baker & Noordewier, 1997). Assessment of customer co-created value is a potentially\nvital performance measure for the provider, for whom it may influence service design. Equally, for\nthe customer, it may assist with \u2019outsource versus in-house\u2019 decisions, with monitoring the\nprovider, and with negotiating terms. In Zeithaml\u2019s (1988) early conceptualization of quality, value\nmediated between quality and price on the one hand, and relationship outcomes on the other;\ndespite this, the majority of service quality research in the intervening period has endeavoured to\nrelate quality to relationship outcomes such as overall satisfaction and retention directly (Davis-\nSramek, Droge, Mentzer & Myers, 2009). As our conceptual framework makes clear, the omission\nof usage process quality and value-in-use from such models implicitly assumes that value is created\nat the moment of service delivery. This assumption is more explicit in the common notion of value\nas quality divided by price (Naumann, 2004) \u2013 a very different concept from Zeithaml\u2019s (1988)\nPage 26 of 48\nconception as quality and price as antecedents to value, which allows for the existence of other\nantecedents. While Naumann\u2019s equation might form a reasonable assessment of value-in-exchange\n(Vargo & Lusch, 2004), it is far from a measure of value-in-use. Thus our first proposition is as\nfollows:\nProposition 1: Current service quality measures, when used in isolation, assume\nthat value is embedded at the moment of service delivery.\n6.2 Usage process quality\nUsage process quality does not previously appear to have been conceptualised or empirically\nexamined in SDL, although there has been a somewhat related examination of user processes as part\nof the technology acceptance model (TAM) in the information systems literature (Davis, Bagozzi &\nWarshaw, 1989). Satisfaction surveys assume that customers can assess the quality of provider\nprocesses. Yet our research shows that customers are quite capable of also articulating their\nperceptions of the quality of their own processes through interaction, usage, and engagement in\ntheir networks. Importantly, this spontaneous talk relates not just to the nature of the usage process\nbut also to its perceived excellence or superiority \u2013 that is, its quality. As with assessments of\nservice quality, customers elaborate on why certain features of the usage process are or are not\nregarded as excellent, in terms of the goals, purposes or objectives that are thereby aided or\nhindered. Hence our second proposition is that:\nProposition 2: The customer\u2019s usage processes can be subjected to quality assessment\nand related to value-in-use.\n6.3 The elicitation of value-in-use\nPage 27 of 48\nAn important finding from our data is that - as with usage process quality - customers can and\n(provided not prompted by an excessively narrow question about the value \u2018delivered by\u2019 the\nprovider) spontaneously do articulate their goals, purposes or objectives, the extent to which these\nare co-created with the provider, and the goal hierarchy by which this value-in-use derives from\nprovider and customer process quality. This leads to our third proposition:\nProposition 3: Value-in-use can be articulated by the customer, just as customers can\narticulate service quality.\nWe note that this proposition, in conjunction with Propositions 1 and 2, adds support to Vargo and\nLusch\u2019s (2004, 2008b) definition of service as the provider\u2019s process of using its resources for the\nbenefit of the customer.3 On the one hand, the customer integrates other resources too in order to\nachieve the benefits they seek: not least, through their own usage processes. Hence service is\ndistinct from value-in-use. On the other hand, service is defined in terms of its contribution to those\nbenefits; that is, the customer perceives a causal chain between the service provided and the benefits\nachieved; and, importantly, the customer judges quality precisely in terms of those service attributes\nwhich are hypothesized as contributing to the customer\u2019s objectives. Support for this argument from\ngoal theory and from our B2B exploration suggests that these definitions of service quality and\nvalue-in-use are not just scholarly constructs but are indeed elicitable aspects of the customer\u2019s\nworldview.\nThis articulation of value-in-use is at both an individual level and a corporate one. Not surprisingly,\ncorporate level evaluations of value-in-use were predominantly made by decision makers, while\nusers tended to assess value-in-use at an individual level. This is consistent with other laddering\n3 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this insight.\nPage 28 of 48\nstudies which observe that decision makers move more quickly to organizational benefits than those\nlower down in the organization hierarchy (Rugg et al., 2002). This might appear to lend support to\nprevious research which has focused on understanding management perceptions of value.\nHowever, an important finding is that value-in-use assessment at both levels is important to the\ncustomer organization\u2019s aggregate view of value. This was emphasised by observations that: (a) all\nof the managers said that following the initial implementation of the OMS, their assessment of\nvalue had been formed by observing the impact on the factory floor (i.e. their perceptions of the\nimpact on users); and (b) one manager emphasised that as a general rule, he made his assessments\nonly after seeking input from factory floor supervisors (i.e. the users).\n6.4 The evolution of value-in-use\nValue-in-use changes by definition depending on the customer\u2019s goals. Customers of B2B solutions\nmay be motivated by \u2018promotion goals\u2019, such that the value of a solution might arise from its ability\nto increase the productivity or effectiveness of the organization. Solution selling often relies on\nidentifying the performance-related objectives of the customer. However, customers of solutions\nmay be even more strongly motivated by \u2018prevention goals\u2019, where the competitive context \u201cmakes\naddressing specific painful problems unmistakably urgent\u201d (Lay, Hewlin & Moore, 2009: 48).\nThat value-in-use changes over time became clear from the case study (consistent with the work of\nBeverland and Lockshin, 2003). Customers\u2019 goals change at different stages of the relationship\nand affect their evaluations of value. Activities that might have initially led to high levels of\nsatisfaction may later be considered \u2018just a given\u2019 at subsequent stages of the relationship. Our\nreading of the case data interprets the changes in value-in-use sought as due, at least in part, to shifts\nin corporate and individual goals from preventative to promotional (see Section 5.5, and in\nparticular contrast Figure 2 with Figure 3).\nPage 29 of 48\nWe note, however, that alternative or complementary interpretations of the data are possible. For\nexample, by Year 4, perhaps easier tasks had been solved and remaining tasks were more difficult,\ngiving the provider increased difficulty in satisfying the customer. Or alternatively, by Year 4 the\ncustomer may have changed their value assessment because they had seen the problem solved,\nrecognised the superiority of this alternative way of operating, and adopted it. Hence adoption of\ninnovations may provide an alternative lens for viewing the evolution of the service, and the\nassessments applied to it, over time. In any event, our case data may not prove typical of other\ncontexts. We therefore tentatively offer the following proposition, with the caveat that it requires\nfurther empirical exploration.\nProposition 4: The value-in-use sought tends to shift from preventative goals to promotional\ngoals as the former are satisfied.\nThis echoes consumer research on the relationship between benefits and post-consumption feelings.\nGiven that avoiding pain is a necessity and that seeking pleasure is a relative luxury, customers\ninitially give higher priority to utilitarian benefits than to hedonic benefits (Chitturi, Raghunathan &\nMahajan, 2008: 50). This means that customers seek to initially \u201celiminate the points of pain\u201d\n(Keiningham & Vavra, 2001: 176) by meeting prevention goals (such as confidence and security)\nthrough utilitarian benefits. However, once prevention goals are met, customers tend to \u201cthen listen\nto their desires\u201d (Keiningham & Vavra, 2001: 176). At this point the provider\u2019s focus should be on\ncustomer delight which is not directly influenced by either prevention emotions or by satisfaction.\nThe provider should be focusing on the promotion benefits that will lead to feelings of excitement\nand cheerfulness.\nPage 30 of 48\n7. Conclusions\nOur conceptual framework for assessment of value-in-use implies that customer value may be\nunearthed by examining the interconnected constructs of: (a) customer assessment of service\nquality, relationship quality, and the emergent construct of network quality; (b) customer\nassessment of usage process quality; and (c) value-in-use. The case data were consistent with this\nframework, while adding a new construct, network quality.\nThe framework views value-in-use as multi-dimensional, and acknowledges both provider and\ncustomer contributions to value creation. It provides deeper insight than service quality alone by\nconsidering directly the customer\u2019s goals. This link to goals acknowledges that value-in-use may\nhave individual components within the corporate environment: as our data show, decision-making\nunits are made up of value-seeking individuals, who perceive the achievement of individual goals as\nwell as corporate ones.\nOur interviews with the customer and the provider have shown that both have a strong interest in\nunderstanding customer-perceived value. Both sides are dissatisfied with existing measures. We\nsuggest that by surfacing usage process quality and the value-in-use \u2013 and not just service quality\nwhich practitioners, like scholars, currently tend to focus on \u2013 we can give both sides much greater\nclarity on customer perceived value. For the provider this has implications for crafting,\ncommunicating and delivering value propositions. For the customer this clarity may assist in\nassessing the cost-benefit trade-off for propositions such as outsourced maintenance. A further\napplication is that by articulating usage process quality and value-in-use, both parties will be in a\nbetter position to determine how their continuing dialogue might generate value in new ways\n(Ballantyne & Varey, 2006b).\nPage 31 of 48\nAs Vargo and Lusch (2004) have argued and our data make plain, value-in-use is highly context\nspecific. Although service quality has many commonalities across contexts, the same seems\nunlikely to be the case \u2013 at least to the same extent \u2013 with value-in-use. Each context, therefore, is\nlikely to require qualitative exploration in the first instance. Our study suggests that this is perfectly\nfeasible, and provides in particular the insight that in a B2B context multiple respondents are\nneeded in order to assess value-in-use at individual as well as organizational level; studies in other\ncontexts \u2013 with different sectors, marketing practice archetypes and so on \u2013 are needed. There\nseems to be no reason why such qualitative work should not be followed by quantitative assessment\nof value perceptions, their antecedents such as the quality of service, relationships, networks and\nusage processes, and their consequences. This would go some way to answering Woodruff\u2019s\n(1997) call over a decade ago for \u201cnew method tools ... to deal with particular customer value\nlearning issues, such as predicting customer value change\u201d (Woodruff 1997: 150).\n7.1 Managerial implications\nWe contribute to a key research priority for managers (Ostrom et al., 2010) by proposing a new\nframework for value-in-use assessment. The conceptual framework shows how customers construe\nthe perceived value of service, and suggests that methods that can uncover the multiple aspects of\nquality and their connection to value-in-use will be required as a precursor to developing\nquantitative methods for assessing value-in-use. Notably, we suggest that qualitative methods\nincorporating laddering will indeed be needed (unless this insight is available informally as a side-\neffect of relational contact) before survey methods can be used, in order to tease out the dimensions\nof value-in-use, usage process quality and so on. A regular customer satisfaction tracker could then\nbe extended to include not just satisfaction with the provider\u2019s service but also with the firm\u2019s own\nusage processes, as well as value-in-use perceptions.\nPage 32 of 48\nSuch holistic measures of value-in-use and its antecedents would have multiple purposes. First, for\nimportant customers such as key accounts, customer-specific problems and opportunities could be\nidentified. Second, aggregate data could be used for purposes of management control. Third, cluster\nanalysis could be used to identify commonalities and differences in value-in-use perceptions. The\nprovider in our case study indeed intends to develop such a customer survey based on the\nqualitative work reported in this paper.\nThe case also provides a commentary on the advantages and pitfalls that can arise from managers\nachieving one of their key research priorities (Ostrom et al., 2010): to stimulate service innovation.\nThe innovation in this case was a complex proposition which evolved as the customer\u2019s goals\nchanged. The embodiment of the proposition in this case as an on-going business relationship\nimplies possibilities for further developing it after its initial implementation through modifications,\nupgrades and cross-selling. This was evident where the customer was calling for more innovation\nas the relationship continued, calls which the provider did not always heed. Partly because it had\nallowed its embedded SP (who worked mostly at the operational level) to take over communication,\nthe provider\u2019s relationship with the customer had shifted down from a strategic relationship to an\noperational one. The danger of no longer holding that conversation at managerial level with the\ncustomer meant that had it not addressed this issue, the provider might have missed key\nopportunities to protect and continue to enhance the relationship. One challenge, then, to innovating\nproviders appears to be to make the value-in-use currently being perceived by operational level staff\nin the customer organization visible to the decision-making unit.\n7.2 Limitations and directions for future research\nThe service evaluated in this case study is tailored to the customer, and the mechanisms identified\nas being key in the case may be specific to the context. While the challenge to assess customer-\nPage 33 of 48\nperceived value that faced both customer and provider in this case may prove typical where\nbusiness models are in flux, future research might beneficially apply the conceptual framework in\nother contexts.\nSuch work might also help towards scale development for usage process quality, network quality\nand value-in-use, along the lines of service quality scales. We note, however, that significant\ncontext specificity may be found for value-in-use in particular. While this is not necessarily a\nproblem for practitioners, who can use an initial qualitative study within a specific context prior to\nsurvey design, scholarly research may wish to explore whether generalised scales can be developed.\nSurvey work might also form the basis for exploration of variations in value propositions across\nmembers of the buying group.\nFinally, the time element in this study emerged from the depth interviews as a result of the\ninterviewees\u2019 own identification of distinct time periods over which value-in-use varied. As\nsuggested by Quintens and Matthyssens (2010), future researchers may wish to explicitly track\nvalue creation over time.\nPage 34 of 48\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, J.C. & Narus, J.A. (1998).

They could get out of their offices, they could start talking to the maintenance\nguys. It was like, I guess, a snowball effect\u201d (D7). \u201cWe\u2019d probably taken our eye off what supervisors should predominantly be\ndoing which is preventative stuff, the visionary stuff, trying to do the planning, the preparation and delivering projects\u201d (U8)\nTo the individual\nTime for my real job U1, U2, U3, U8 \u201cIt frees up my time\u201d (U1); \u201cIt saves days in negotiation\u201d (U1), \u201cI save days chasing parts\u201d (U3)\nTransfer the problem U1, U2, U3 \u201cIt makes my life easy because I just say, there you are [provider] sort it out for me and then it\u2019s not my problem anymore\u201d (U1)\n\u201cGets rid of my red tape activities\u201d (U2).\nRisk management U1 \u201cIf a repair doesn\u2019t come back right I can blame [the provider]\u201d (U1)\nPage 44 of 48\nTable 2: Quality and value dimensions (Year 4)\nDimensions Interview(s) Illustrative quotation(s)\nSERVICE QUALITY\nOrganization\nReporting on warranty\nrepairs\nD5 \u201cThey don\u2019t give us reports on warranty repairs anymore\u201d (D5)\nReporting on repairs U3, D6, U8 \u201cOf the ones that failed what did they do? I want them to show me how they are consistently improving\u201d (D6). \u201cWe should\nget sent a report on the items that were sent away\u201d (U8). \u201cWe want not a lot of hassle to find out what has been done\u201d (U3).\nQuality of repairs U2, U3 \u201cThere\u2019s a problem - which I\u2019m surprised they\u2019ve got - we aren\u2019t sure of the quality of their repairs\u201d (U3). \u201cBut a problem we\nare seeing a lot of, which then causes my guys more work, is things coming back that aren\u2019t repaired\u201d (U2).\nCustomer focus D6 \u201cThe problem is that they are constantly looking at their bottom line, not at our bottom line\u201d (D6).\nService professional\nSense of urgency U1 \u201cI think they often don\u2019t understand what I mean by urgent.. when I say something is urgent I expect a courier now to get the\npart and take it away\u201d (U1)\nCompetence \/ experience D5, U8 \u201cThey lack someone with the knowledge of [the original service professional]\u2026 we\u2019ve had some real sagas\u201d (D5).\nRELATIONSHIP QUALITY\nCommunication D5, D6, D7 \u201cAs a service provider, I think they should be doing a better job at telling us what they are doing for us rather than us asking\nthem\u201d (D7). \u201cThey should provide more quantitative measures of the services they offer (for example the percentage of\npeople who are satisfied\u201d (D6). \u201cI\u2019ve got problems with the transparency on the reporting and things\u201d (D5).\nCloseness of\nmanagement teams\nU8 \u201cWe never see their management team anymore\u201d (U8).\nNature of relationship D6 \u201cThe current relationship is OK but not great\u201d (D6).\nNETWORK QUALITY\nCoverage of supplier\nnetworks\nD5 \u201cI just get the feeling that [the provider] hasn\u2019t got the breadth of suppliers they need to have\u201d (D5)\nPage 45 of 48\nTable 2: Quality and value dimensions (Year 4) (cont.)\nDimensions Interview(s) Illustrative quotation(s)\nCUSTOMER USAGE PROCESS QUALITY\nMicro-management (-ve) U1, U8 \u201cWe often have to chase stuff up with them which I don\u2019t want to do\u201d (U1). \u201cWe are having to audit them because we don\u2019t\nhave the confidence they are doing it\u201d (U8)\nRegular analysis D4, D7 \u201cI think we have lost our way a bit in terms of the quantitative analysis\u201d (of the value of the service) (D7). \u201cWe don\u2019t do audits\nany more, we are just letting them get on with it.
