The southern Bellingshausen Sea (SBS) is a\nrapidly-changing part of West Antarctica, where oceanic and\natmospheric warming has led to the recent basal melting\nand break-up of the Wilkins ice shelf, the dynamic thin-\nning of fringing glaciers, and sea-ice reduction. Accurate\nsea-floor morphology is vital for understanding the contin-\nued effects of each process upon changes within Antarc-\ntica\u2019s ice sheets. Here we present a new bathymetric grid for\nthe SBS compiled from shipborne multibeam echo-sounder,\nspot-sounding and sub-ice measurements. The 1-km grid is\nthe most detailed compilation for the SBS to-date, reveal-\ning large cross-shelf troughs, shallow banks, and deep inner-\nshelf basins that continue inland of coastal ice shelves. The\ntroughs now serve as pathways which allow warm deep water\nto access the ice sheet in the SBS. Our dataset highlights ar-\neas still lacking bathymetric constraint, as well as regions for\nfurther investigation, including the likely routes of palaeo-\nice streams. The new compilation is a major improvement\nupon previous grids and will be a key dataset for incorpo-\nrating into simulations of ocean circulation, ice-sheet change\nand history. It will also serve forecasts of ice stability and fu-\nture sea-level contributions from ice loss in West Antarctica,\nrequired for the next IPCC assessment report in 2013.\n1 Introduction\nContributions to sea level from 21st Century changes in the\nWest Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) will form a key part of the\nFifth Assessment Report of the IPCC due in 2013.

In May 2008 the Wilkins ice shelf dramati-\ncally disintegrated and recent satellite measurements of ice-\nsurface elevation have indicated that glaciers which drain\ninto the SBS have undergone dynamic thinning (thinning\nas a result of flow acceleration) related to warming deliv-\nered through the oceans (Rignot and Jacobs, 2002; Pritchard\net al., 2009), and as a result of the southerly migration\nof regional isotherms (i.e. atmospheric warming; Cook and\nVaughan, 2010). A major ice stream, Ferrigno Glacier, which\ndrains into Eltanin Bay, thinned by more than 0.5 m yr\u22121 be-\ntween 2003\u20132007 (Pritchard et al., 2009) and currently ex-\nhibits thinning rates of ca. \u22126 m yr\u22121 at its grounding line.\nOceanographic data have also shown the SBS is a key area\nwhere warm Circumpolar Deep-Water (CDW; temperature\n\u22651.0 \u25e6C, salinity 34.7 psu) periodically floods onto the shelf\n(Talbot, 1988; Jenkins and Jacobs, 2008), and coupled ther-\nmodynamic models indicate that ice shelves in the SBS have\nbeen thinning rapidly as a result of basal melting, possibly\nfor some decades (Holland et al., 2010). Reduction in sea ice\nsince the 1970s is another indicator that the SBS is undergo-\ning considerable environmental stress (Jacobs and Comiso,\n1997). Thus it is of little surprise that a major focus of\nUK and US environmental research is the fast-changing SBS\narea.\nTopography is a key input parameter for any ice or ocean\nmodel addressing issues of change since the existence of\ntroughs and other landforms controls the delivery of oceanic\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n96 A.

In addi-\ntion, without realistic boundary conditions, models will not\nsimulate the evolution of the ice sheets accurately and may\nmisrepresent future contributions to climate change or sea\nlevel as a result. In the SBS, the current landscape be-\nneath the ice is underexplored and poorly known despite\nan ever-increasing ability to quantify subglacial topography\n(e.g. Pritchard and Bingham, 2007). For example, during\na recent radar survey of the Ferrigno Glacier, Bingham et\nal. (2010; unpublished data) discovered a >3000 metre-deep\nsub-ice trough, that is not represented in any existing topog-\nraphy (e.g. BEDMAP; Lythe et al., 2001). Likewise, the\nbathymetry of the SBS is often poorly represented in grids\nthat are frequently used by modellers to simulate ice changes\nThe Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011 www.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/\nA. G. C. Graham et al.: An improved bathymetry compilation for the Bellingshausen Sea 97\nand ocean circulation. A recent compilation of Antarctica\u2019s\nbed by Le Brocq et al. (2010) highlighted the weakness of\nbathymetry in regional compilations of Antarctic topogra-\nphy (Fig. 1b). While some regions are now well represented\n(e.g. the Amundsen Sea; Nitsche et al., 2007), the gridded\nbathymetry from the SBS remains inadequate for showing\nhow the ice and ocean interact there. An improved topogra-\nphy for the sea floor was recently presented by Timmerman\net al. (2010), but the grid was based on only a handful of\nthe available sounding datasets for the embayment and failed\nto resolve some of the key topographic features clearly in-\ncluding the outline of the shelf break. Better bathymetry is\nneeded urgently for this region, given that models of changes\nin the cryosphere (including the ice-sheet and ocean) will di-\nrectly inform the next IPCC assessments of climate change\nand sea-level rise.\nIn this paper, a new bathymetric grid is presented for the\ncontinental shelf and slope for the region 100\u201366\u25e6 W, 75\u2013\n68\u25e6 S in the Bellingshausen Sea (Fig. 1a). Existing grids for\nthe area show a variety of different topographies but none\nclearly define the detailed morphology of the shelf, includ-\ning the shelf edge and major cross-shelf troughs that have\nbeen partially imaged on multibeam echo-sounder data in the\narea (e.g. \u00b4O Cofaigh et al., 2005b; Dowdeswell et al., 2008;\nNoormets et al., 2009).\n2 Approach and method\nSyntheses of depth soundings into representations of sea-\nfloor topography have traditionally been carried out by hy-\ndrographers who draw contour maps by hand to portray in-\nferred morphology (Sandwell et al., 2001). However, these\nmethods are imprecise and often non-reproducible. An al-\nternative and successful method for producing bathymetry in\ndeep ocean areas is to apply an inversion to satellite gravity\ndata, but there are severe limitations to recovering sea-floor\ntopography from radar altimetry: namely, its moderate res-\nolution and problems of noise in gravity anomaly measure-\nments of the ocean surface slope (Smith and Sandwell, 1994;\nMacnab, 2009). This is particularly the case along polar con-\ntinental margins, as in the SBS, where sea-ice cover and vari-\nations in thickness of the crust and sedimentary strata are sig-\nnificant factors affecting the gravity anomaly field. Further-\nmore bathymetry data generated from inversion of Geosat\ndata do not extend beyond 72\u25e6 S. Therefore, for the purpose\nof regional ice or ocean modelling on a continental shelf we\nconsider the best bathymetric representation to be derived\nprincipally from in situ shipborne measurements.\nWe followed a procedure established by other work-\ners to produce a bathymetric compilation for the Belling-\nshausen Sea. Our approach mirrors closely that of Nitsche\net al. (2007), Fretwell et al. (2009) and Beaman et al. (2011),\naggregating ship soundings from many expeditions and com-\nbining them with other spatial data (sub-ice, sub-ice-shelf\nand land) to produce a continuous regional chart (Fig. 1c).\nAs primary context, sub-ice \u201cbed\u201d elevation data were ex-\ntracted from ALBMAP v.1 (LeBrocq et al., 2010) masked to\nthe ice fronts and coastline drawn from the Antarctic Digital\nDatabase v.4.1. We converted the 5-km netcdf grid to xyz\npoints and added these to our input dataset. Next, multibeam\ndata were gridded at 300-m cell size using the mbgrid tool\nin MB-system (Caress and Chayes, 2006) with a Gaussian\nweighted averaging function and allowed a free interpolation\nto the limit of 2 grid cells (0.6-km radius; N.B. version 1.1.\nof the grid). The grid included new swath bathymetry tracks\ncollected by the RRS James Clark Ross in 2008 and RV Oden\nin 2009\/2010. The majority of multibeam datasets had al-\nready been ping-edited to ensure removal of spurious data\nprior to our obtaining them for inclusion in the compilation.\nSingle beam echo-sounding data were compiled from a num-\nber of additional cruises of the James Clark Ross, RV Natha-\nnial B. Palmer, RV Eltanin, RV Polar Duke, and RV Po-\nlarstern (Table 1) and included in the grid. Ship-based spot\nsoundings from the Bellingshausen Sea UK Hydrographic\nOffice Collector\u2019s Sheet were also digitised and added to the\ndataset (Fig. 1c). These single soundings are particularly sig-\nnificant in areas where multibeam coverage is lacking and\nsoundings from other scientific cruises are sparse.\nTo the west of the study area there are few data points\nto constrain topography and here we steered the grid to-\nwards a shelf edge shape that is consistent with the satellite-\nderived gravity anomaly field by adding a \u2212580 m contour\napproximating the shelf-edge from the Smith and Sandwell\ngravity-derived topographic grid (Smith and Sandwell, 1997;\nFig. 1c). However our use of these data was minimal,\namounting to ca. <0.001% of the total dataset (11 points\nfrom a total of\u223c1 400 000). In addition, we digitised sub-ice\nshelf topography from Maslanyj\u2019s (1987) seismic soundings\nof the George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) and removed inaccurate\nshallow soundings from the ALBMAP point-set (inherited\nfrom BEDMAP) using a mask tool. To avoid aliasing issues\ndue to its narrow rift walls, we gridded the bathymetry of\nGVIIS separately to the remainder of the grid with a mini-\nmum curvature spline at 1-km grid spacing. The resulting\nraster was integrated into the compilation before final grid-\nding.\nA by-product of including this separate dataset was the oc-\ncurrence of a prominent ridge at the northern front of GVIIS,\nwhich resulted from the interpolation between deep sub-ice\nshelf bathymetry and shallow parts of the GLOBEC dataset\non the inner shelf (Bolmer, 2008). No evidence for this ridge\nwas found in existing bathymetric soundings indicating that\nanomalously shallow grid values in the GLOBEC grid were\nartificially \u201cpulling up\u201d bathymetry at the ice front. As a po-\ntential obstacle to motion of the grounding-line and ocean\nthroughflow, the ridge was identified as an artefact and re-\nmoved from the compilation by adding six control points at\nthe northern ice front to constrain bathymetry to a sensible\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/ The Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011\n98 A.

This method allows for near-seamless integration\nwith their Amundsen Sea bathymetric grid.\nFinal gridding of a merged point file was carried out us-\ning the Natural Neighbour algorithm in ArcGIS 9.3 (Sibson,\n1981). The interpolation tool finds the closest subset of input\nsamples to an interpolation point and applies weights to them\nbased on proportionate areas to interpolate a value. As data\nquality varies between the input surveys, several iterations\nwere required to identify and remove anomalous measure-\nments (e.g. data spikes from poorly-processed echo sounder\ndata). We produced a continuous topography with a grid cell\nsize of 1000 m.\n3 Results\nThe resulting grid is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It covers an\narea of the shelf, slope, and ice-sheet interior >810 000 km2\nin size. The continental shelf edge is well defined for the\nfirst time by the \u2212600 m contour, except at the mouth of the\nprominent Belgica Trough where the shelf break lies a little\ndeeper at ca. \u2212700 m (cf. Timmerman et al., 2010). A few\nsmall re-entrants to the west of the grid are artefacts resulting\nfrom sparse input data, due to persistent ice cover north and\nnortheast of Thurston Island which repeatedly prevents ship\naccess (Figs. 1c, 2). Measured linearly from the coastline,\nthe width of the shelf varies from very narrow (\u223c100 km)\nnorth of Charcot Island to broad (400\u2013480 km) in the central\nBellingshausen Sea (Fig. 2). Water depths on the shelf also\nvary considerably from >1000 m in the deepest inner-shelf\nbasins to ca. 400\u2013500 m on shallower banks.\nThe main shelf feature is Belgica Trough, a 430\u2013550 km\nlong (measured on a curvilinear course through Eltanin Bay\nand Ronne Entrance, respectively), 50\u2013120 km wide, and\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/ The Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011\n100 A.

On\nthe inner shelf, Belgica Trough is shown to be a conver-\ngent system connected by smaller tributary troughs to each\nof the Ronne Entrance and Eltanin Bay basins. The trough\nshoals from the inner shelf basins towards the middle shelf,\nbefore flattening out and deepening once again towards the\nshelf break (Fig. 4c), where the trough mouth also widens\n(Fig. 4a). A small, second order trough, known to exist on\nthe outer shelf within Belgica Trough (Hillenbrand et al.,\n2009) and resolvable in TOPAS profiles across the trough\naxis (Fig. S2), is well imaged in the new bathymetric chart\nmeasuring ca. 25 km wide, and 30\u201340 m deep (Fig. 4a and\nb). A new u-shaped trough is also revealed in the bathymetry\nto the east of Belgica Trough, which we refer to as Latady\nTrough. Latady Trough originates in Wilkins Sound and\npossesses an additional connection to the Ronne Entrance\n(Fig. 2). It is 390 km long, up to 80 km wide, has an arcu-\nate planform expression, and like the neighbouring Belgica\nTrough, features characteristics which suggest it has been\nglacially-carved (e.g., u-shaped, retrograde slope). In addi-\ntion, the data suggest the presence of two smaller troughs\non the inner shelf in the western part of the study area,\nnear 87\u25e6 W and 91\u25e6 W, but the data coverage is currently\ntoo sparse to outline their shape or extent (Fig. 2). Shallow\nbanks, typically 400\u2013500 m deep, separate the troughs and\nalso characterise regions of the inner shelf between deeper\nbasins (Fig. 2).\nAt the mouth of the Belgica Trough, a major glacial de-\npositional centre (Belgica Fan; Dowdeswell et al., 2008) is\nrepresented in the new bathymetry, in its entirety, for the first\ntime (Figs. 3 and 4a). It is characterised by widely-spaced\nslope contours and a clear bulge in the margin profile which\nbecomes progressively exaggerated with increasing depth. A\nsmaller fan may also exist on the outer shelf at the mouth of\nLatady Trough (at ca. 82\u25e6 W; Fig. 3), as inferred previously\nby Scheuer et al. (2006) and Noormets et al. (2009), with a\npotential third fan farther east at ca. 80\u25e6 W (Fig. 3). In addi-\ntion, other parts of the lower slope and upper continental rise\nare generally well imaged across our study area, including\nthe bathymetry surrounding Peter I island at \u223c90\u25e6 W, 69\u25e6 S\n(Figs. 3 and 4a). Refined bathymetry in this area will be par-\nticularly useful for future modelling of deep water circulation\n(Holland et al., 2010).\nSome uncertainties still remain in the bathymetric chart.\nSeams between detailed multibeam bathymetry and interpo-\nlated areas can cause artefacts manifested as sudden changes\nin seafloor roughness, but these are a necessary trade-off in\nexchange for a higher grid resolution and more detail. Track-\nline artefacts such as these are common to most bathymet-\nric compilations (e.g. Nitsche et al., 2007; Jakobsson et al.,\n2008). In addition, in areas with few data points, it should be\nnoted that the vertical accuracy of the dataset is significantly\nreduced because in these areas the grid relies on interpola-\ntion over large sectors unconstrained by real measurements\n(e.g. north of Thurston Island). Figure 1c highlights several\nareas of the sea floor that remain entirely devoid of real ob-\nservations. Likewise, sub-ice shelf bathymetry is still poor\nin the SBS. However, our inclusion of seismic soundings be-\nneath George VI ice shelf greatly improves the bathymetry\nbeneath the southern limb of the ice shelf, and our removal\nof ridge artefacts at the ice front also improves representation\nof the connection between the northern limb and Marguerite\nBay (Fig. 2; see Supplement).\nThe Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011 www.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/\nA.

For location, see Fig. 2.\nExact uncertainties are difficult to establish for the new\ngrid, given the range of data types, vintages, and associated\nerrors that make up the input dataset (e.g. some multibeam\ndatasets with a vertical accuracy of e.g. 1\u20132 m versus older\nsoundings with 10\u2019s of metres of potential error). Neverthe-\nless, we provide some basic error estimates for the grid\u2019s in-\nput datasets in Table 1, based on the RMS accuracy of the\nshipboard sonar systems used during acquisition, for water\ndepths relevant to this study. We acknowledge that other\nfactors including sea-state, beam angle, sea-floor geology,\nsound velocity correction, and signal-to-noise ratio may dras-\ntically affect sonar accuracy. Thus we suggest that readers\nconsult original data sources and related publications for fur-\nther details of uncertainty associated with individual surveys\n(Table 1).\nAs well as errors in the data, uncertainties also exist in the\ngrid interpolation process itself. To provide an estimate of\ngridding uncertainty, we took a sub-sample of 100 000 in-\nput data points and compared their true (measured) elevation\nagainst the corresponding Z-value for the grid cell at that lo-\ncation. We report an RMS error of 112 m, and a Mean Ab-\nsolute Error of 52 m for the grid. Larger errors occur locally\nand are usually associated with very steep topography (e.g.\naround Peter I Island, and parts of the upper slope). Whereas\nthese data skew the RMS and MAE towards higher values, in\ntruth over half the data have a local error <10 m, and \u223c70%\nof the dataset <30 m. These results suggest that the final in-\nterpolation adheres well to the input measurements.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/ The Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011\n102 A. G. C. Graham et al.: An improved bathymetry compilation for the Bellingshausen Sea\nOverall, this compilation is a major step in data represen-\ntation for the Bellingshausen Sea compared to the BEDMAP\nand recent ALBMAP compilations (Fig. 1b), and reveals\nmore detail than found within new continent-wide datasets\n(Timmerman et al., 2010). Digital versions of this grid\nare available for download at: http:\/\/doi.pangaea.de\/10.1594\/\nPANGAEA.746255 in netcdf and ArcGIS- compatible ascii\nraster formats (also included as a Supplement to the paper).\n4 Discussion\nOur new bathymetry resolves major topographic features of\nthe Bellingshausen Sea shelf in detail for the first time. At 1-\nkm resolution, the grid is of a much higher resolution than\ncurrent coupled ice-ocean or ice-sheet models require be-\ncause such simulations are computationally intensive and re-\nquire a significant amount of running time, especially where\nworking in large regional domains. However, even when\nresampled to lower resolutions, the differences in our grid\ncompared to alternative counterparts are such that the new\nbathymetry should be useful immediately. Furthermore we\nanticipate future improvements to model \u201cability\u201d (i.e. reso-\nlution and processing capability; Holland et al., 2010) which\nwill allow for the use of more detailed boundary conditions\nwith time.\nA main observation is the continuity of cross-shelf troughs\nfrom the shelf edge to the modern ice-shelf fronts. Several\nstudies have suggested that warm CDW must reach the ice-\nshelf fronts in the SBS to explain high rates of basal melting\nobserved there (Talbot, 1988; Jenkins and Jacobs, 2008; Hol-\nland et al., 2010). The new grid demonstrates that continuous\nconnections exist between the shelf edge where CDW orig-\ninates, and each of the southern George VI and Wilkins ice\nshelves, and Eltanin Bay ice front, via Belgica and Latady\nTroughs. Ferrigno glacier in particular, which has exhibited\ndynamic thinning and which may be an analogue for fast-\nchanging glaciers such as Pine Island Glacier, has a continu-\nous bathymetric link to the shelf edge along which the min-\nimum depth is only slightly shallower than 600 m, except\nacross a ridge near to its modern grounding line (at 400 m;\nFig. 4c). The current surface elevation change of Ferrigno\nglacier is measured at \u223c\u22126 m yr\u22121 at the grounding line,\nwhich makes the ice stream one of the most dynamic on the\nPacific margin of West Antarctica outside of the Amundsen\nSea sector (Pritchard et al., 2009).\nWarming as a result of CDW intrusion onto the inner shelf\nhas been cited repeatedly as an explanation for the recent\nthinning and rereat of some West Antarctic glaciers, and this\nappears to be the most likely cause for Ferrigno glacier\u2019s cur-\nrent changes (Rignot and Jacobs, 2002). However, the ap-\nparent ridge at the grounding line of the glacier would pose\na clear obstacle to any deep-water ocean influence on the ice\nmargin, if the sill were real. Thus, the simplest interpretation\nat present is that the sill imaged in our grid is an artefact of\nexisting topographic datasets and warm CDW does actually\nfind access to the grounding line via the glacial cross-shelf\ntrough. An embayment at the latitude and with the shape\nof Eltanin Bay would typically host an ice shelf, so the ab-\nsence of an ice-shelf or floating ice tongue today supports\nthe presence of a warm-water influence right up to the mod-\nern coastline. Further survey of the glacier\u2019s grounding line\nis warranted however, to substantiate the presence or absence\nof a sill, and to establish possible mechanisms behind recent\nice-sheet thinning in the SBS.\nIn contrast, oceanographic models of GVIIS indicate that\nvirtually all of its current melting variability is driven by\nocean processes at the southern end of the sub-ice cavity,\nin Ronne Entrance (Holland et al., 2010). Our grid shows\nboth the Latady Trough and Belgica Trough connect to the\nsouthern limb of GVIIS through bathymetric deeps of 800\u2013\n1000 m. Likewise, the base of the Wilkins Ice Shelf is con-\nnected to the shelf edge via the 600\u20131000 m deep Latady\nTrough. Although surface water might be a significant factor\nin melting these \u201cthroughflow\u201d ice shelves (Holland et al.,\n2010), interaction with warmer deep water masses is likely\nto play an important role in promoting high basal melt rates\nand ice-shelf changes in the SE Bellingshausen Sea.\nThe improved morphological characterisation of Belgica\nTrough also reveals that the outermost shelf slopes seaward\nand the trough gradient is relatively flat on the mid to outer\nshelf (Fig. 4c). In most other large palaeo-ice stream troughs\nin Antarctica, the outer shelf exhibits a distinct reverse slope\ntowards marked and deep (up to 1500 m) inner shelf basins\nnear to the coastline (e.g. Pine Island Trough; Graham et al.,\n2010). Theoretical studies have suggested that reverse gra-\ndient ice-sheet beds are a causal factor in ice-stream insta-\nbility and fast grounding line retreat (Vaughan and Arthern,\n2007; Katz and Worster, 2010). However, a recent chronol-\nogy presented for the retreat of palaeo-ice in Belgica Trough\nhighlighted an unusually slow and continuous deglaciation\nfor the WAIS in the SBS (calculating mean retreat rates of\n7\u201355 m yr\u22121) (Hillenbrand et al., 2010). We hypothesise that\nthe unusual shape of the outer shelf, together with a shal-\nlower trough profile, may have been influential for the style\nof ice-sheet recession in the Belgica Trough drainage catch-\nment. Moreover, the mouth of Belgica Trough forms the\ndeepest part of the shelf edge around West Antarctica which\nmay be a reason why the WAIS apparently began its retreat\nearly across this part of the continental margin (Hillenbrand\net al., 2010).\nA further feature which defines Belgica Trough\u2019s morphol-\nogy is its second-order trough (Fig. 4). The feature\u2019s loca-\ntion, nested within the larger Belgica Trough on the outer\nshelf (Figs. 4a, S2), implies a multi-episodic formation for\nboth the main and subordinate troughs. It was previously\nspeculated to have formed by meltwater outbursts during the\nlast deglaciation (Hillenbrand et al., 2009). Imaged here in\nfull for the first time, we propose an alternative genesis for\nthe feature: the trough forming as a result of focused glacial\nThe Cryosphere, 5, 95\u2013106, 2011 www.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/\nA.

Ice stream pathways are identified based on interpretations of Anderson et al. (2002), Heroy and Anderson (2005),\nEvans et al. (2006), \u00b4O Cofaigh et al. (2005a, b), Domack et al.

An analogue for such flow\nvariability already exists in the modern, in cross-stream ve-\nlocity variations measured on the Carlson-Talutis ice stream\n(e.g. Vaughan et al., 2008). As such, the second-order trough\nmay pose an interesting site for further study with possible\nrelevance to the flow behaviour of Antarctic ice streams op-\nerating today.\nIn addition, the bathymetry grid offers, for the first time,\na sharp definition of the continental margin that was absent\nin previous compilations (e.g. Figs. 1b, 3). The morphology\nof the margin and slope is highly significant for modelling\nalong-slope currents and for establishing the precise loca-\ntions of CDW intrusion onto the shelf. Warm deep water may\npreferentially move onto the continental shelf via shelf break\ncurvatures and depressions (Dinniman et al., 2004; Walker\net al., 2007) so an accurate delineation of the shelf edge can\nbe considered a basic requirement of successful ocean mod-\nels. Similarly, ice-sheet reconstructions also require a well-\ndefined shelf break to establish the limit of former grounded\nice, and the correct shape of the ice-margin has implications\nfor ice-sheet models because changes in ice margin geometry\nwill alter the strain distribution in simulated ice-sheets.\nFinally, the new depiction of sea-floor landscape reveals\ninformation about the pathways of former ice streams in the\nSBS. The new grid resolves at least two separate troughs that\naccommodated fast-flowing ice streams in the past. While\nBelgica Trough is already well-known as a former ice-stream\nroute ( \u00b4O Cofaigh et al., 2005b), Latady Trough is identi-\nfied here, for the first time, as a probable palaeo-ice stream\npathway. Limited bedform data already show fast grounded\nflow in the upstream portion of this route ( \u00b4O Cofaigh et al.,\n2005b), and unpublished multibeam data reveal streamlined\nlineations at the sea floor which suggest northerly grounded\nice flow west of Latady Island (British Antarctic Survey, un-\npublished data: included in the compilation). These data\nimply that the trough was an important outlet for ice drain-\ning Alexander Island during glacial periods.

Thus, the new grid should become a valuable re-\nsource for modellers reconstructing palaeo-ice activity in the\nBellingshausen Sea and for future expeditions targeting the\nmain channels of ice flow in the past ice sheets.\nOn a regional scale, our grid adds to a number of others\nwhich depict the gross morphology of the West Antarctic\nPacific margin, and show it to be dominated by cross-shelf\ntroughs that were carved by, and repeatedly channelled, ar-\nteries of ice flow (palaeo-ice streams) to the fringes of the\ncontinental shelf during periods of more extensive glaciation\n(Fig. 5). A compilation of these bathymetric charts illustrates\nat least 8 known palaeo-ice stream systems between 120\u2013\n60\u25e6 W which were active at the Last Glacial Maximum, and\nhighlights an additional 4 areas in the SBS region where the\nhistory of ice flow is almost entirely unknown (Fig. 5). These\nlatter regions require further marine geological investigation\nespecially since the few data that do exist indicate the po-\ntential for additional ice-formed troughs. In the meantime,\nthe newly-improved regional bathymetry can be used imme-\ndiately to test the reproducibility of ice stream locations and\nto constrain the patterns of long-term deglaciation within ice-\nsheet models of the palaeo-WAIS and Antarctic Peninusla Ice\nSheet. Future improvements to the grid can only help in con-\nstraining these models further, and may be achieved through\nadditional grid processing to remove trackline artefacts, in-\ntegration of novel bathymetric datasets (e.g. Padman et al.,\n2010), and targeted sonar mapping in areas not yet visited by\nresearch vessels.\n5 Summary\nWe produced the most detailed bathymetric grid to-date for\nthe hitherto poorly mapped southern Bellingshausen Sea in\nWest Antarctica. Our dataset shows that glacial troughs\ncarved out by the WAIS and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet\nduring repeated glaciations of the continental shelf are now\nprobably instrumental in delivering warm CDW to the ice\nmargin, which has been a factor in the recent rapid demise\nof both grounded and floating ice in the Bellingshausen Sea.\nUse of our grid in future ice and ocean models is strongly\nencouraged, to help determine WAIS stability and forecast\nfuture loss from the ice sheets which translates directly into\nglobal sea-level. We also identify the wider application of\nthe new bathymetry for mapping benthic biodiversity and re-\ngional biological trends (e.g. the Census of Antarctic Marine\nLife (CAML) community), habitat mapping across differ-\nent sea-floor terrains, structural geological and tectonic re-\nconstructions of the West Antarctic continent which utilise\npresent-day sea-floor topography (e.g. Eagles et al., 2009),\nas well as a starting point for reconstructions of Antarctic\npalaeo-topography.\nSupplementary material related to this\narticle is available online at:\nhttp:\/\/www.the-cryosphere.net\/5\/95\/2011\/\ntc-5-95-2011-supplement.zip.\nAcknowledgements.
