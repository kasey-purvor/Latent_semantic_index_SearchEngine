Here, Elaine Aston returns to the 'kitchen' in Bobby Baker's\nperformances of 'daily life'. The article examines Baker's 'language' of food which 'speaks'\nof domesticity, and her conjunction of comic playing and the hysterical marking of the\nbody, to show how her performance work constitutes an angry, feminist protest at the\nlack of social transformation in women's lives. Elaine Aston has authored a number of\nstudies on contemporary women's theatre, and is Chair of Contemporary Performance\nand Theatre Studies, Lancaster University.\nIN THE 1960s, before second-wave feminism,\nsociology lecturer Hannah Gavron researched\nthe lives of young mothers from middle-\nclass and working-class families in North\nLondon. Her research was published post-\nhumously as The Captive Wife (1966).1 Her\nsub-title, Conflicts of Housebound Mothers,\npoints to a domestic and maternal narrative\nof isolation, frustration, and confinement for\nwomen that second-wave feminism began to\naddress and to challenge in the 1970s.\nAmong the four demands of the liberation\nmovement, the request for twenty-four hour\nnurseries and free contraception and abortion\non demand were central to the possibility of\na social metamorphosis of women's mater-\nnal and reproductive lives. Despite these\nfeminist demands, however, relatively little\nwas to change. In particular, the conflict for\nwomen between the roles of mother and\nworker, which Gavron had highlighted,2 if\nanything grew more acute in the Thatcherite\n1980s, which promoted the myth of the\nSuperwoman - the working mother who\ncould 'successfully' combine professional life\nwith family life.\nIt is hardly surprising, therefore, that\nGavron's study remains ominously familiar,\nand that, despite certain class differences,\nmiddle- and working-class mothers with\ncare of young children remain 'isolated from\nthe mainstream of society',3 and still experi-\nence the difficulty of combining work and\nfamily.\nPerformance artist Bobby Baker takes the\n'conflicts of housebound mothers' and wives\nas a key (although not exclusive) subject for\nher shows. Like the women researched by\nGavron in her study, Baker is also a North\nLondon mother. She introduces herself - in\ninterviews and in the opening to her shows -\nas a middle-class housewife and mother of\ntwo from London N7. In particular, she\nmarks the tension between motherhood and\nwork. This tension was one which Baker\nexperienced in her own career: after training\nas an artist, her emergent performance career\nin the 1970s was interrupted by an eight-year\nbreak in which she birthed and cared for her\ntwo children. When Baker returned to perfor-\nmance in the late 1980s she created Drawing\non a Mother's Experience, and in the 1990s\nestablished her 'Daily Life' series, which so\nfar includes Kitchen Show (1991), How to Shop\n(1993), Take a Peek! (1995), and Grown-Up\nSchool (1999).4\nThat Baker's work imports her auto-\nbiographical 'daily life' experiences into a\nperformance context is important. Of course,\nwhen the autobiographical T enters the\nfictional frame of performance it raises many\ncomplex questions and issues around iden-\n17\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ntity, authenticity and construction of self -\nquestions which have received consideration\nelsewhere.5 What is important in Baker's\ncase is that her observational style of comedy\nis dependent upon the sense that she has\ndirect experience of the events she describes.\nAs one reviewer explained in a commentary\non her 1980 show, My Cooking Competes: 'The\naudience knew that this presenter had actu-\nally performed all these tasks, that they had\ntaken up her time, just as they wear away the\ntime of countless women, day after day.'6\nIn this way Baker, like Gavron with her\nempirically researched mothers, finds a\nmeans of introducing the 'real mother' into a\nsphere of representation from which she is\ntraditionally absent. For instance, in Mother-\nhood and Representation, E. Ann Kaplan\nexamines the discursive levels of the socially\nconstructed mother (historical) and the\nmother in the unconscious (psychoanalytic)\nin literary and film texts (fictional), but\nclaims that the fourth mother, the 'real life'\nmother, is not representable.7 Instead, she\nhopes that her analysis of historical, psycho-\nanalytic, and fictional mothers will be of\nsome benefit to the 'conflicted, difficult, and\nmarginalized life' of the 'real mother'.\nBy contrast, it is precisely this 'conflicted,\ndifficult, and marginalized life' of the real\nmother which Baker introduces by taking\nherself as subject of and agent for her work.\nShe uses her personal memories, experi-\nences, feelings of her 'real life', or 'daily life'\nas a middle-aged housewife and mother of\ntwo to challenge the socially constructed\n(historical) role of the mother. Her experi-\nences as a mother combine with her skills as\nan artist to transform the patriarchally con-\nstructed mother by unleashing the intense\npains and pleasures conventionally repres-\nsed and constrained by this dominant ideo-\nlogical formation.\n'Drawing on a Mother's Experience'\nFundamental to Baker's performances of\n'daily life' is the way in which she commu-\nnicates her experiences through the 'lan-\nguage' of food.8 After formally training as a\npainter, Baker began to work not with the\npaints of the artist's palette, but with the\ncolours and textures of the oral palette - of\nfood. Before she began work on food sculp-\nture, she 'among other things . . . danced\nwith meringue ladies, recreated the history\nof modern painting in sugar, and made a\nlife-size cake family in a sugar-decorated\nprefab entitled An Edible Family in a Mobile\nHome? Even when her work began to incor-\nporate dialogue, food remained her primary\n'language' - a means of communicating the\nexperiences of domestic, 'daily life' which\nshe shared with women in her audiences.10\nAfter her eight years away from the stage\nto have children, Baker returned to perfor-\nming with her food-painting show, Drawing\non a Mother's Experience, in which she des-\ncribes the experiences of becoming a mother\nand her subsequent transformation into a\nworking mother. In The Captive Wife Gavron\nquotes from a Marriage Guidance Council\nbooklet published in 1963 to describe the\ntime with young children as 'a time of \"pots\nand nappies, crying, feeding and the all\nimportant business of burping. It is the most\nextraordinary mixture of the sublime and the\nridiculous, the anxious and the funny\".'11\nOne might be forgiven for thinking this was\na reviewer commenting on Drawing on a\nMother's Experience.\nThe performance of Drawing begins with\nBaker laying out a polythene sheet to protect\nthe floor. Onto the polythene she spreads, as\nneatly as possible, a white double bed-sheet\n(her 'canvas'), onto which she proceeds to\nmark the experiences of becoming a mother.\nStarting in one corner, Baker presses down\nslices of cold roast beef to make a 'sensitive'\nmark recalling the birth of her first child. In\nthe style of a Jackson Pollock action painting\nshe makes further marks\/memories out of\nmilk, fish pies, stout, yoghurt, blackcurrants,\npreserves, tea, biscuits, black treacle, egg\nyokes, and whites. Verbally she refers to\nherself as a mother who is skilled at thrifty\nshopping, at recycling materials to avoid\nwaste, and as someone who is most experi-\nenced in cleaning and clearing up after others.\nConscious that such daily realities are\ntreated as mundane, boring, and insignifi-\ncant, she looks for short cuts in her maternal\n18\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nand domestic re-enactments to spare her\naudience the monotony of time-consuming,\nlabour-intensive tasks, or the embarrassment\nof the abject, reproductive body. At the close,\nshe exits as she entered - with all her food-\nstuffs packed into two plastic shopping bags,\nleaving not a trace of her presence in the\nperformance space.\nIn Draiving, the food painting 'speaks' the\nanxieties provoked by the idea of the 'suc-\ncessful' mother which women frequently\ninternalize. Many of these are linked to the\nbusiness of feeding. Baker, for example,\nnarrates the experience of being 'consumed\nby the worry of feeding', and marks the\nearly days of breast feeding her first child\nwith possets and dribbles of milk on the\nsheet. But this marks not only her 'success' at\nbeing able to breast feed (which she tells us\nshe was able to do to excess), but also the\nconsumption of her own body. As Rosalind\nCoward explains:\nAround the child's feeding, a whole drama\nis played out around anxiety, around which\nthe adequacy of mothering can be assessed.\nAnd this anxiety, produced by medical and\nscientific opinion, overlays the already anxious\nrelations which a mother and child will have\non the subject of food. Such opinion crosses over\nthe unconscious conflicts which a woman experi-\nences between the command to provide, to\ngive out and nourish, and the fear that, in so\ndoing, she may be consumed and disappear\naltogether.\nAs Baker's narrative\/painting unfolds, her\nnourishment of the baby raises the issue of\nwho, in turn, will feed the mother. It is\npossible to read this both literally in terms of\nthe incredible appetite which accompanies\nbreast feeding, and metaphorically - as\nwomen's hunger for keeping something of\ntheir own lives, their autonomy.\nBaker's need for self-nourishment is\nsigned through the action of the stout,\nbottles of which she rolls across the sheet to\nproduce marks which are more pronounced\nthan the 'sensitive' marks made by the roast\nbeef. She then repeats the action until she\nsucceeds in making the bottles chink - a\nsound which reminds her of the chink which\nthe empty bottles made as they rattled in the\nBobby Baker in Drawing on a Mother's Experience.\npram tray as she bumped her way over the\npavement to take the empties back to the off-\nlicence. (Delightfully, she tells us of the\ntroubled gaze of the health visitor who, on\none occasion, happened to witness this not-\nquite-so-'proper' image of the mother.)\nThe 'Old' Mother and the 'New'\n'Drawing on a mother's experience' takes on\nanother or double meaning, as it refers also\nto Baker's own mother. While the husband\nis busy rushing off to work, it is Baker's\nmother, she tells us, who feeds the hungry\ndaughter. Although psychoanlytically the\ntime of becoming a mother is seen as a\nmoment of potential reconciliation between\nmother and daughter, in reality it may also\nbe a period of difficult and complex nego-\ntiation between the 'old' mother and the\n'new'; between the different, generational,\ninternalized systems of 'successful' mother-\n19\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ning, or between the desire to be a mother and\nthe fear of becoming one's own mother, etc.13\nBaker gives 'voice' to these generational\ntensions through the mark of the fish pie: the\nfood her mother brought to nourish her,\nwhich had orange crumbs, rather than her\nown pie with wholemeal crumbs. Then the\nhidden tensions of drawing on one's own\nmother's experiences are further imaged in a\nmark made by a pudding of yoghurt and\nblackcurrants. On the one hand, this signifies\na comforting moment of self-infantilization,\nwith Baker the 'child' who eats up all her\nmother's puddings, even though she does\nnot like them.14 On the other hand, the\nrepressed resentment which this occasions\nexplodes in the urge to pop the black-\ncurrants, to crush them underfoot, and to\nadmire the chroma this produces in the\npainting: an intensity of pink as the red of\nthe currants dominates the white, milky\nyoghurt beginnings of the mark.\nThe lighter colours in the first part of the\npainting, the early days of mothering, are\ngradually overlaid by darker colours pro-\nduced by foodstuffs which, for example,\nnarrate a stressful time of money worries -\nmarked by the strong-smelling, brilliant red\nof her home-made, money-saving preserves.\nThe birth of a second child, marked by tea,\nbarely makes an impression, and if anything\nis 'slightly dull' and immediately swamped\nby strong swirls of black treacle. The treacle\nhints at a life outside of children as Baker\nmakes reference to her training as a painter\nand leads into her penultimate sequence: the\ntransformation into a working mother.\nBaker chooses to celebrate this transfor-\nmation with a recipe for a pudding which\nshe recollects making at this time for dinner\nparties. Preparing food for the entertainment\nof others is a different kind of cooking ritual:\na social occasion, signifying the mother's\nreturn to a public life - or rather a working\nlife that she has to combine with the work of\nmothering. Separating the yokes from the\nwhite of the eggs, Baker rushes around the\nsides of her sheet, trying not to trip up, to\nattend separately to the preparation of each\npart of the egg, and, finally, to fold these both\ninto the painting.\nThe recipe fails if the yoke and the white\ndo not separate - which speaks volumes to\nthose of us whose daily lives are a constant\nbattle to make a life split between children\nand work more manageable. Very briefly, she\ntakes delight in the feathering effect which\nthis produces before, dramatically, cancel-\nling out her drawing by sifting flour over the\nwhole sheet. There is, she explains, an\nelement which is too painful to talk about.\nAs Griselda Pollock argues: 'The painful\nmemories will not be left, sanitized by their\naesthetic look, assimilated back to the action\npainting they cleverly resemble.'15\nThe white blanket of flour cannot, how-\never, cover up all these marks\/memories.\nNor should they, as Baker's final sequence\nsuggests, be completely repressed. Instead,\nBaker rolls herself up in the sheet so as to\nresemble a 'human swiss roll' and takes\nthese marks on to her body. The struggle to\nget to her feet, whilst swathed in the marks\nof maternity, is considerable. She tells us she\nused to worry she would not get out, but\nthat she learnt not to panic. Then, in a quiet\nmoment of celebration, she begins to dance.\nPreviously she had told us she was not\nskilled at dancing, but this is a moment in\nwhich she pleasures herself - a final gestus\nshowing the struggle of the professional\nartist, successfully emergent from the 'sheet'\/\nmaternal, despite the way in which the body\nis weighed down, making it difficult to\nmove. Baker's choice of song to dance to,\nNina Simone's 'My Baby Just Cares for Me',\nis, she informs us, not significant: a final\nironizing of the mother, who, in truth, is\nalways at risk of being consumed by the act\nof caring for others.\n'Kitchen Show'\nWhile I was researching this article I kept\nremembering an independent feminist film\nfrom the late 1970s which I used to teach for\nthe Open University: Often During the Day,\ndirected by Joanna Davis. The film shows\nseveral shots of a kitchen, interspersed with\nextracts of text from Ann Oakley's The\nSociology of Housework - the text of which is\npresented both on screen and as voice-over -\n20\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nand uses a looped sound-track of everyday\nkitchen noises: tea-pouring, bread-cutting,\nchairs scraping. The technique of the sound\nloop effectively brings home the unchang-\ning, mindless, repetitive, endless, and thank-\nless tasks of domesticity. In the film, it is a\nwoman who is imaged as repeatedly clear-\ning up after others. It made for extremely\nuncomfortable viewing - but that of course\nwas the point.\nLike Often During the Day, Baker takes the\nkitchen as her setting for the first in her 'Daily\nLife' series, Kitchen Show. When she began\nperforming Kitchen Show in 1991, Baker\nreinforced the point about the spheres of\ndomesticity\/private and work\/public by\nstaging the show in her own North London\npine kitchen, rather than in a theatre.16 The\npiece is structured through twelve daily\nactions which take place in her kitchen, each\nof which she marks on her white overalls\nwhich have now become a hallmark of her\nshows.17\nAs she performs each one we hear about\nthe domestic story, event, feeling, experi-\nence, sensation, or memory associated with\nit, delivered in a documentary-style ('to-be-\ntaken-seriously') voice-over. The reviewer\nfor Time-Out explains:\nThe kitchen is the stage where she presents her\nprivate self through twelve actions she might\ncarry out any day, from clearing out the cutlery\ndrawer to rinsing spinach. These are strung\ntogether with female confidences, reminiscences,\nand send-ups of the apologetically appreciative\nmiddle-class wife and mother, and her inspired\nramblings take the lid off a woman's mind and\nmake sense and nonsense of the routines of\nrunning a home.18\nBaker re-presents the kitchen as a site of\nmany mixed emotions and pleasures: of anger\n(marked by the action of hurling a pear to\nrelieve tension); of joy (as she rinses and\npeels carrots under running tap water); or of\nthe oral pleasures of 'taste sensations' - the\nrepeated action of nibbling away at food\n(marked by red lipstick).\nThat the kitchen also evokes childhood\nmemories indexes the relatively unchanging\npatterns of the familial\/maternal life which\nBobby Baker in Kitchen Show, as performed at the\nLondon International Festival of Theatre, 1991.\nPhoto: Andrew Whittuck\ncontinue to situate women\/mothers in the\ndomestic.19 Lack of social transformation is\narguably a reason for the way in which\nBaker draws on hysteria as a protest against\nher domestic 'confinement' . As Catherine\nClement explains, the role of the hysteric is\nboth 'anti-establishment and conservative'.\n'The hysteric unties familiar bonds, intro-\nduces disorder into the well-regulated un-\nfolding of everyday life', and yet 'the family\ncloses around her again'.20 Performing hys-\nteria, therefore, is a way of marking a protest\nagainst domesticity: of disturbing the 'order',\nthe social system which continues to posi-\ntion women within the maternal and the\ndomestic spheres.\n21\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nHysteria as Performance\nBaker creates a performance register out of\na combination of clowning and physical\/\nhysterical markings of the body to relate\nevents, and experiences from her daily life,\nin a way highly reminiscent of the three-\nphase 'performance' of la grande hysterie by\nthe patients of the nineteenth-century 'expert'\nin female hysteria, Jean-Martin Charcot.21 In\nthe final phase of la grande hysterie, known as\nthe attitudes passionnelles, the patient would\nmime events and emotions from her life.22\nSimilarly, Baker's hysterical marking of her\nbody is a way of 'writing' events, memories,\nsensations, and emotions associated with the\n'madness' of the kitchen.23\nFor example, the first mark in Kitchen\nShow is one in which Baker talks about the\nritual of making tea. At the end of this\nsequence she marks the ritual by binding or\nbandaging her hand with elastoplast into a\nteaspoon-holding position. The hand remains\nthus bound, contorted like the hand of the\nhysteric, as the performance continues. Each\naction\/mark is posed for the camera; the\nmemory of an event or an emotion is thus\nwritten on to the body and 'photographed'.24\nThe last mark, her thirteenth mark - just\nto make it a Baker's dozen - is to exhibit her-\nself, complete with all twelve marks of\nritualized domesticity, on a cake-stand. In\npresenting herself rather than the meal as the\n'product' of her domestic labours, Baker\nreverses the visibility\/status of the food\/\nmeal and the invisibility\/low status of the\nwoman who labours in the kitchen on behalf\nof her family.\nMoreover, in this final, Charcot-styled\npose, she demythologizes the myth of the\n'body beautiful'.25 In offering herself up for\nvisual 'consumption', Baker highlights the\nway in which food regulates body image\nfor women. Her overalled body is neither\nstreamlined like her cats (as she reminds us\nwith the plastic black bin-liner pegged on to\nher shoulders), nor can it 'glide' in the blue\nsky (marked by the blue J-cloths stuffed into\nand trailing behind her slippers).\nHer head is doused in water, her hair is\nknotted with a wooden spoon, her face is\nsmudged with margarine, and her lips are\ncovered in red lipstick. And yet what is most\nimportant, Baker explains to us, is the look\nwhich these marks make when they are seen\nall together. Hysteria, as Elaine Showalter\nsummarizes, is 'a form of expression, a body\nlanguage for people who otherwise might\nnot be able to speak or even to admit what\nthey feel'.26 The vocabulary of Baker's thir-\nteenth mark, all her actions put together,\narticulates the domestic\/the 'feminine' body\nas festival and refusal; writes the 'language'\nof the kitchen on and through her body both\nas a celebration of and a protest against\n'daily life'.\n'Spitting Mad'\nOne of the dangers in the reception of\nBaker's work is that the reviewers see only\nthe clowning, not the anger; that they tend,\nas Claire MacDonald (commenting on Draw-\ning on a Mother's Experience) explains, to read\nher performance only through one self: 'the\nexperienced mother' who makes them 'feel\nthey are in safe hands'.27 However, in\nSpitting Mad, Baker's short film for BBC2's\n'Expanding Picture' series (1997), it is hard to\navoid the rage of the maternal. In this 'in-\nyour-face' performance Baker unleashes the\nanger of the mother which is traditionally\nsilenced by the dominant, caring, nurturing\nimage of maternity.\nBriefly, Spitting Mad opens with Baker in\nher garden luxuriating in the fresh, white,\nlinen cloths hanging out on her washing line.\nA quick tug on a cloth, and we switch to her\nspotless linen cupboard, where we see Baker\ntaking pleasure in the cleanliness and soft-\nness of the neatly stacked washing. From the\ncupboard we move to a clinical space set with\ntable, chair, and kitchen-style cupboards.\nThe encoding of the clinical again suggests\nan association between the kitchen and the\nasylum: a kitchen table and chairs are set in\nfront of a sash window, the bars of which, lit\nlike the furniture in harsh, bright light, link\nthe activity of the kitchen, of food, to mad-\nness. In her white overalls Baker signifies\nboth housewife and ('hysterical') patient\/\ninmate.28\n22\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nA white cloth is laid out on a bare table.\nBaker presents her materials: some household\nfoodstuffs, which variously include oranges,\na tin of soup, jams, wine, and sauces. Out of\nthese she proceeds to make a series of five\ntablecloth paintings. All of the five food\npaintings are made via the mouth, through\nspitting. In painting number one, Baker\nchews on orange segments, takes them out\nof her mouth, squeezes them into the cloth,\nand knots them into the material with twine.\nAs she twists and knots the segments into\nthe cloth we note a surge of anger in the\naction, and the anger mounts through the\nsucceeding four actions\/paintings: Weight\nWatchers tomato soup, sucked up through a\nstraw and blown out onto the cloth to make\na lined pattern; strawberry and apricot jams\npressed out of her lips onto the cloth; red\nwine gargled and sprayed out over the cloth;\nand sauces (yellow and red), chewed and\nspewed into and onto her 'canvas'. While the\npaintings start out with patterns (oranges)\nand lines (soup) the symmetry is upset and\ndistorted by rising anger. Working with the\njam painting, Baker abruptly announces that\nshe finds the lines of the lip-shapes of jam\npressed onto the cloth boring, and promptly\nspews out mouthfuls of pink (presumably\nstrawberry) yoghurt to make it more al've.\n23\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 09 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nIn the final painting, the camera moves in\nfor a close-up shot as Baker, angrily, tells us\nthat she needs to concentrate to make sure\nthat we get her point. Whereupon she tilts\nback her head, opens her mouth wide, and\npours in the Heinz tomato sauce until her\nmouth is full, overflowing, and then vomits\nthe red sauce out over the cloth. The anger\nin this final 'spitting mad' action, signed\nthrough the mound of red sauce splattered\non the cloth, is especially violent.\nIt is through the mouth and the symbo-\nlism of the regurgitated food that Baker\n'speaks' the rage of the mother in Spitting\nMad. As orifice, opening on\/to the body\nthrough which food\/fluids may pass, the\nmouth refuses the idea of the bound, pure,\nproper body, and highlights the abject: the\n'dirt', defined in Mary Douglas's terms as\n'matter out of place'. 'Where there is dirt\nthere is a system', Douglas argues.29 Systems\nof domesticity\/maternity are exposed in\nBaker's film as she upsets the idea we have\nof the kitchen as a site of cleanliness and\nhygiene - the idea that anyone preparing\nfood (and, as Baker established in Drawing\non a Mother's Experience and Kitchen Show,\ntraditionally in the family this means the\nmother) has to be clean, hygienic: in her\n'proper' place. Not to obey all the rituals and\nrules around cleanliness - hand-washing,\nfood-tasting, etc. - is to contaminate, to pol-\nlute, to create disorder.30\nMoreover, the angry regurgitation of food\nre-visions the 'natural'\/nature imagery of\nthe mother who feeds her young in the nest,\nto suggest not the 'good' mother \/breast (in\nKleinian terms), but the repressed 'mad'\/\n'bad' mother who fears that she will be\nsucked dry by the baby\/child who must al-\nways be fed; and anger, at the way in which,\nas Coward elucidates, 'domestic relations\nare ordered around the satisfaction of men's\nand children's oral needs. Women are expec-\nted to nourish not to demand.'31\nIf one takes the Freudian infantile theory\nof birth in which pregnancy is equated with\neating (birth with defecating),32 then expel-\nlation rather than ingestion of food symboli-\ncally encodes a refusal of the child\/family\nin the interests of self-nourishment. Or,\nborrowing from Kristeva,33 the spitting-out\nmay be read as a means of protecting the self\nfrom others - in this case, refusing the mater-\nnal self to establish 'myself, which is especi-\nally marked in the spitting out of the Heinz\nsoup (a sign of children's food\/meals).\nAs in Drawing on a Mother's Experience,\nworking with the white tablecloths, which\nbecome messy through the food painting,\ngives expression to the way in which a\nmother's work is a repetitive daily round of\ntidying, cleaning, and creating order (as in\nthe linen cupboard) only to have the family\ncreate disorder, dirt, mess, chaos.\nWhereas Spitting Mad opens with the\nclean sheets hung out on the line - lovingly\ntouched and admired by Baker - it closes\nwith a row of 'painted'\/'soiled' cloths on\ndisplay. This 'dirty protest', out in the public\nspace of the garden, is not, however, public\nenough. Instead, Baker selects two of her\npaintings\/cloths from the line to take with\nher on a boat on the River Thames. Out on\nthe river she acts as pilot, waving her cloths,\nsignalling in semaphore, to the repeated\nvoice-over, 'Provide better feeding'.\nIn this, her closing image, Baker is a\nveritable embodiment of the 'mad', carnival-\nesque mother. Hers is the 'off-side' maternal\nbody, which Cixous and Clement describe: a\ndangerous site of disorderly refusal.34 Like\nthe river (which eventually flows out to la\nmere, sea\/mother) she spills out into the city;\nrefuses to be repressed or contained. Baker\nintroduces or 'paints' the 'mad' mother into\nthe foreground of the male-dominated city-\nscape: Westminster, Big Ben, and the Houses\nof Parliament are here in the background.\n'Provide better feeding', the State's com-\nmand to mothers, is 'regurgitated' through\nthe food paintings as a feminist demand for\nthe transformation of women's lives: the\nbetter provision for and nourishment of a\nmother's 'daily life'.\nNotes and References\n1.

In her autobiographical talk given at the New\nWorks Festival, Leicester, in September 1997, Baker\ndescribed the three fundamental principles of her work\nas (1) drawing on her own experiences; (2) working\nwith food; and (3) striving for artistic integrity.
