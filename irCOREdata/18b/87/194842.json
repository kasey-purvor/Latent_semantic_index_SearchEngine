The strong, broad, skewed iron line is clearly detected and\nis well characterized by a steep emissivity profile within 6rg (i.e. 6G M\/c2) and a flatter profile\nbeyond. The inner radius of the emission appears to lie at about 2rg, consistent with results\nreported from both an earlier XMM-Newton observation of MCG\u20136-30-15 by Wilms et al.\nand part of an ASCA observation by Iwasawa et al. when the source was in a lower flux state.\nThe radius and steep emissivity profile do depend however on an assumed incident power-law\ncontinuum and a lack of complex absorption above 2.5 keV. The blue wing of the line profile\nis indented, either by absorption at about 6.7 keV or by a hydrogenic iron emission line. The\nbroad iron line flux does not follow the continuum variations in a simple manner.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: general \u2013 galaxies: individual: MCG \u2013 6-30-15 \u2013\ngalaxies: Seyfert \u2013 X-rays: galaxies.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15 has played an important role\nin studies of accretion on to black holes owing to the presence of a\nbroad, skewed iron line in its X-ray spectrum (Tanaka et al. 1995).\nThe shape of the line seen with ASCA is consistent with emission\nfrom the surface of an accretion disc extending from about 6 to\nmore than 40 gravitational radii (6\u201340rg; rg = G M\/c2) inclined at\nabout 30\u25e6 to the line of sight (Fabian et al. 1995). Occasionally\nthe red (i.e. lower energy) wing of the line is seen to extend below\n4 keV (Iwasawa et al. 1996; 1999). This can be explained by the\ndisc extending within 6rg which may imply the black hole must be\nrapidly spinning. The presence of the broad iron line in MCG\u20136-\n30-15 has been confirmed by BeppoSAX (Guainazzi et al. 1999),\nXMM-Newton (Wilms et al. 2001) and Chandra (Lee et al. 2002).\nHere we present preliminary results from a long 325 ks observa-\ntion of MCG\u20136-30-15 made with XMM-Newton. The source was at\na similar flux level to the previous ASCA observations, and about\n70 per cent brighter than during the earlier 100 ks XMM-Newton ob-\nservation reported by Branduardi-Raymont et al. (2001) and Wilms\net al. (2001). Simultaneous observations were made with BeppoSAX,\nproviding coverage from \u223c0.2\u2013100 keV. The present work focuses\non the spectrum above 2.5 keV and the iron K line features; absorp-\n\u0002E-mail: acf@ast.cam.ac.uk\ntion and emission features below 2 keV owing to oxygen and other\nelements will be discussed more fully in later work.\n2 DATA R E D U C T I O N\nMCG\u20136-30-15 was observed by XMMM-Newton (Jansen et al.\n2001) over the period 2001 July 31\u20132001 August 5 (rev. 301, 302\nand 303), during which all instruments were operating nominally.\nThe present analysis is restricted to the data from the European Pho-\nton Imaging Cameras (EPIC). Both the EPIC MOS cameras (Turner\net al. 2001) and the EPIC pn camera (Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001) were oper-\nated in small window mode and used the medium filter. Extraction of\nscience products from the Observation Data Files (ODFs) followed\nstandard procedures using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Sys-\ntem v5.2 (SAS).\nThe EPIC data were processed using the standard SAS processing\nchains. Source data were extracted from circular regions of radius\n30 arcsec from the processed MOS and pn images and background\nevents were extracted from regions in the small window least ef-\nfected by source photons. These showed the background to be rela-\ntively low and stable throughout the observation, with the exception\nof the final few ks of each revolution where the background rate\nincreased. Data from these periods were ignored. The total amount\nof \u2018good\u2019 exposure time selected was 315 ks and 227 ks for MOS\nand pn, respectively. (The lower pn exposure is due to the lower\n\u2018live time\u2019 of the pn camera in small-window mode, \u223c71 per cent).\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS\nL2 A. C. Fabian et al.\nThe ratios of event patterns as a function of energy showed there\nis negligible pile-up in the pn data but the MOS data suffer slightly\nfrom pile-up. A comparison of the data extracted including and\nexcluding events from the central 10 arcsec of the source region\nshowed only a slight flattening (\u0005\u0006 \u223c 0.06) in the piled-up spec-\ntrum. This small effect was ignored in order to increase the number\nof source counts.\nEvents corresponding to patterns 0\u201312 (single\u2013quadruple pixel)\nwere extracted from the MOS cameras and patterns 0\u20134 (sin-\ngle + double) were used for the pn spectral analysis, after checking\nfor consistency with the pattern 0 (single pixel event) data. The total\nnumber of photons extracted from the source region was 6.23\u00d7106\nfor the pn and 2.35 \u00d7 106 for each MOS camera. The BeppoSAX\ndata were processed in the standard manner (Fiore, Guainazzi &\nGrandi 1999).\n3 S P E C T R A L A NA LY S I S\nThe spectral calibration of the EPIC cameras is still evolving. Using\nthe publicly available software and response matrices, the remaining\ncalibration-dependent residuals over the 2.5\u201310 keV range consid-\nered here should be at the \u00015 per cent level (see Ferrando et al.\n2002). However, there remain problems with the model for charge\ntransfer inefficiency (CTI) for pn small-window mode data. In order\nto mitigate the effects of this, a conservative approach was used for\nthe present analysis, with detailed spectral fitting results based on\nonly the MOS data.\nThe source spectra were grouped such that each bin contains at\nleast 20 counts and were fitted using XSPEC V11.1 (Arnaud 1996).\nThe spectral responses used were m1_medv9q19t5r5_all_15.\nrsp for MOS1 (and similarly for MOS2) and epn_sw20_sdY9_\nmedium.rmf for the pn. The quoted errors on the derived model\nparameters correspond to a 90 per cent confidence level for one\ninteresting parameter (i.e. a \u0005\u03c7 2 = 2.7 criterion), unless otherwise\nstated, and fit parameters (specifically line and edge energies) are\nquoted for the rest frame of the source.\nThe EPIC MOS data show a spectral form remarkably simi-\nlar to those seen in earlier ASCA observations, as illustrated in\nFig. 1 (cf. fig. 1 of Iwasawa et al. 1996). The residuals around\n6 keV have been interpreted as a broadened and redshifted iron\nK\u03b1 emission from a relativistic accretion disc (Tanaka et al. 1995).\nOnly the XMM-Newton EPIC spectrum above 2.5 keV is exam-\nined here, to limit the effects of the complex soft X-ray absorption\n(see also Lee et al. 2001), a detailed treatment of which is beyond\nthe scope of this Letter. This energy range also excluded the region\naround the detector Si K-edge (1.84 keV) and the mirror Au M-edge\n(2.3 keV). To constrain the continuum, and in particular the Comp-\nton reflection component (e.g. George & Fabian 1991; Nandra &\nPounds 1994), better, the BeppoSAX MECS and PDS data were also\nfitted simultaneously. The normalizations of the MOS and MECS\ndata were allowed to vary independently, to account for differ-\nences in the absolute calibration, with the PDS normalization tied to\n0.86 times the MECS value (Fiore et al. 1999). Galactic absorption\n(NH = 4.06 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122; Dickey & Lockman 1990) was included\nin all the models discussed below.\n3.1 Phenomenological model\nThe iron line residuals were initially parametrized using a simple\nmodel comprising a power law plus Compton reflection, narrow\n(\u03c3 = 10 eV) Gaussian at 6.4 keV and a broad Gaussian whose en-\nergy and width were free parameters. The Compton reflector was\nFigure 1. Combined MOS spectrum (the data were combined for plotting\npurposes only) and ratio of data to a power-law model joining the 2\u20133 keV\ndata and 7.5\u201310 keV data. As this is not a realistic model for the continuum\nthe residuals should be considered merely as representative of the spectral\ncomplexity. The inset panel shows a close-up of the iron line region with the\n6.9-keV feature marked. This figure is available in colour on Synergy, in the\nonline version of the journal.\nassumed to be a neutral, static slab subtending a solid angle of 2\u03c0 sr\nat the X-ray source, inclined at i = 30\u25e6, and having solar elemen-\ntal abundances (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995). The primary contin-\nuum was a power law with an exponential cut-off at a fixed energy of\n400 keV (constraints on the reflection and continuum parameters are\ndiscussed later). This model gave a good overall fit with \u03c7 2 = 984.1\nfor 1034 degrees of freedom (dof ). The broad line component had\nan energy E = 4.8 \u00b1 0.3 keV, a width of \u03c3 = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 keV and\nequivalent width EW = 527 \u00b1 70 eV. The narrow, 6.4 keV \u2018core\u2019\nhad EW = 38 \u00b1 10 eV and peaked very close to 6.4 keV, with\nE = 6.40 \u00b1 0.04 keV if allowed to be free.\nVery narrow components to the iron line, unresolvable by EPIC,\nhave been observed in the Chandra HETGS spectra of several\nSeyferts (Yaqoob, Goerge & Turner 2002). They may be identified\nwith emission from, e.g. the BLR or molecular torus. Such narrow\nlines are not ubiquitous, however, and allowing the 6.4 keV compo-\nnent to have a finite width is resolved with a width corresponding\nto FWHM \u2248 30 000 km s\u22121 and EW = 120 eV. The fit is excellent,\nthe parameters are given in Table 1 (model 1). A preliminary analy-\nsis of the pn data gave generally consistent results and in particular\nthe core of the line was again resolved. See also Lee et al. (2002).\nThe large width of the line core suggests that this also arises in the\ndisc, rather than at a greater distance (cf. NGC 5548; Yaqoob et al.\n2001).\n3.2 Relativistic line profiles\nTo provide a more physically realistic description of the data the\nline profile of Laor (1991) was used to describe a broad line from\nan accretion disc surrounding a rotating black hole. The disc was\nassumed to be in a low state of ionization, with the rest energy of\nthe line fixed at 6.4 keV. The fits were relatively insensitive to the\nouter radius of the disc, which was therefore fixed at Rout = 400rg.\nThe free parameters in the model were: the inner radius of the disc,\nRin, the inclination, i, and the emissivity as a function of radius,\nwhich was parametrized as a power law of index q (i.e. R\u2212q ).\nBoth the line and the reflection spectrum were blurred using the\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 335, L1\u2013L5\nLooking at MCG\u20136-30-15 with XMM-Newton L3\nTable 1.

The preliminary pn analysis gave comparable results but\nsuggested an even stronger red wing to the line.\n3.3 Additional iron K components\nBefore exploring the red wing further it should be noted that there is\nsome additional complexity in the line region at \u223c7 keV (see inset of\nFig. 1). Including an iron K-edge in model 2 provided a significant\nimprovement in the fit (\u03c72 = 908.2\/1032), with an edge energy of\nE = 7.38\u00b10.09 keV and a depth of \u03c4 = 0.11\u00b10.02, similar to that\ndiscussed by Pounds & Reeves (2002). However, such an edge must\nhave a physical origin; if it is caused by neutral or near-neutral iron\nalong the line of sight, then strong iron-L absorption is expected\nwhich is inconsistent with the soft X-ray spectrum (Lee et al. 2001).\nIf the material is out of the line of sight and the edge is due to re-\nflection off distant material, the reflection component must be very\nstrong (R \u223c 3), which is then inconsistent with the relatively weak,\nnarrow 6.4-keV iron line observed in the spectrum. Another possi-\nbility is that the edge arises from thick material partially covering\nthe line of sight. This gives a comparable fit (\u03c72 = 894.6\/1032) to\nthe edge, with a covering fraction of \u223c0.16. Using this model the\nbroad line parameters differed only slightly from those of model 2,\nand the broad, red wing of the line, extending within 6rg, was still\nrequired in the fit.\nSako et al. (2002) suggested there may be significant absorp-\ntion in the 6.4\u20136.7 keV range due to inner-shell transitions of ion-\nized iron. This possibility was explored by including an absorp-\ntion line in model 2. This gave a good fit (\u03c72 = 923.9\/1031 dof )\nwith absorption-line parameters E = 6.74 \u00b1 0.05 keV and EW =\n138 \u00b1 35 eV. The relativistic line parameters differ only slightly,\nwith the emissivity index changing to q = 6.6 \u00b1 1.1.\nAn alternative interpretation is that the complexity around 7.0 keV\nis in an emission component, identified with recombination emis-\nsion by H-like iron. Adding a Gaussian to model 2 at E \u2248 6.9 keV\nagain improved the fit (\u03c7 2 = 956.1\/1032 dof ) and gives best fitting\nparameters of E = 6.91 \u00b1 0.03 keV and EW = 18 \u00b1 6 eV. If a\nline of this strength is caused by gas photoionized by the observed\ncontinuum then it must lie within a radius of \u223c2 \u00d7 1016 cm. Since\nit is not possible to unambiguously determine between absorption\nand emission as the source of complexity above 6.5 keV, both are\nconsidered in the following subsections.\n3.4 More complex models\nA steep emissivity function was required to model the red wing\nof the line (see also Wilms et al. 2001), but this gave too little flux\nfrom the outer parts of the disc to model the core of the line. This\nraises the possibility that the emissivity function is not a simple\npower law. This was explored by using a broken power law for the\nemissivity function, with emissivity index qin from Rin to Rbr and\nindex qout from Rbr to Rout. The fit parameters for this model are\ngiven in Table 1 (model 3).\nThis fit is not physically self-consistent for at least two reasons.\nFirst it ignores the emission from Fe K\u03b2, which is expected at\n7.05 keV. Secondly, the high EW of the line is not consistent with\nour assumptions about the reflection component, namely that it has\nRrefl = 1, i = 30 deg, solar abundances and is neutral. In such cir-\ncumstances, considering the observed value of \u0006, the predicted EW\nis only 140 eV (George & Fabian 1991). Two plausible possibilities\nare that the iron abundance in the accretion disc is higher than the\nsolar value (see e.g. Lee et al. 1999), or that the reflection compo-\nnent is enhanced for some reason, for example owing to anisotropy\n(Ghisellini et al. 1991) or geometry (Fabian et al. 2002).\nThe high abundance case was examined by fixing the iron abun-\ndance of the reflector to 3 \u00d7 solar in model 3. This in fact im-\nproved the overall fit compared to the solar abundance case (\u03c72 =\n877.2\/1031 dof ). Changes in the disc line parameters were negligi-\nble. The value of the cut-off energy can affect both the high energy\nspectral shape and the apparent strength of the reflection compo-\nnent. Allowing Ecut to be free in this fit gave Ecut = 241+228\u221286 keV\n(\u03c7 2 = 875.4\/1030 dof ). Allowing Rrefl to be a free parameter fur-\nther improved the fit, therefore this was also left free in model 4.\nModel 4 comprised a power law plus cold reflection (with over-\nabundant iron, AFe = 3), emission from iron K\u03b1 (6.40 keV) and K\u03b2\n(7.05 keV). The reflection plus line spectrum was then blurred us-\ning the LAOR kernel (with a broken power-law emissivity function).\nA narrow emission line at E = 6.9 keV (fixed) was also included\nin the model. This provided the best fitting model, with a cut-off\nenergy Ecut = 122+90\u221218 keV and Rrefl = 2.2+1.1\u22120.7, the other parameters\nare given in Table 1. The model and fit residuals are shown in Fig. 2\nand the \u2018fluxed\u2019 line profile based on this fit is shown in Fig. 3.\nIncluding an absorption line instead of a 6.9-keV emission line\ngave a slightly poorer fit (\u03c7 2 = 863.0\/1027 dof ) with line param-\neters E = 6.74 \u00b1 0.02 keV, EW = 31 \u00b1 9 eV (consistent with the\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 335, L1\u2013L5\nL4 A.

The\naverage continuum fluxes during these intervals differ by > \u00d72. The\nratio of the two spectra is shown in the top panel of Fig. 5 and shows\nclear signs of spectral variability. There is a slight depression around\n6.4 keV, indicating that the iron line core is stronger (compared to\nthe continuum) in the low-flux spectrum. The bottom panel of Fig. 5\nshows the residuals from fitting a power-law model to the difference\nspectrum (i.e. high-flux minus low-flux spectrum). The difference\nspectrum is consistent with a power law in the range 2-10 keV and\nFigure 4.

A detailed analysis of the spectral variability properties will\nbe given in a forthcoming paper but these first results are consis-\ntent with the simple two-component continuum model described in\nShih, Iwasawa & Fabian (2002).\nThe suggestion that the iron line was not as variable as the contin-\nuum was borne out by an examination of the rms spectrum. Fig. 6\nshows the normalized rms variability spectrum derived from the\nrevolution 302 pn data. The rms spectrum clearly shows that the\nfractional variability amplitude is suppressed at energies close to\nthe iron line, compared with surrounding continuum bands (see also\nInoue & Matsumoto 2001).\nA further point to note is that the rms spectrum (and the ratio of\nhigh\/low spectra) are smooth in the 0.2\u20131.0 keV range. In particular,\nthe absence of any feature at 0.7 keV in the spectral ratio is expected\nif the large drop at that energy (Fig. 1) is due to absorption (with\nconstant optical depth). For the drop to be the blue wing of an\nemission line (Branduardi-Raymont et al. 2001), the line intensity\nmust be responding linearly to the continuum flux (unlike the iron\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 335, L1\u2013L5\nLooking at MCG\u20136-30-15 with XMM-Newton L5\nFigure 6.

An examination of the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS)\nspectra confirms this result.\n5 D I S C U S S I O N\nA long observation with XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX of MCG\u2013\n6-30-15 in its typical state has again confirmed the presence of\nthe broad, skewed iron line. All the models considered above are\nformally acceptable (\u03c72\u03bd < 1.0), and all include emission within 6rg,\nconsistent with emission from a disc around a spinning black hole.\nModel 4 provides the best (in a \u03c7 2-sense) and most physically\nself-consistent explanation of the data. In this model, the disc emis-\nsivity is described by a broken power-law in radius, and it is in-\nteresting to note that the break radius occurs at \u223c6rg. Beyond this\nradius the disc has an emissivity profile qout \u223c 2.5 and produces an\niron line with an equivalent width \u223c200 eV (the 5.5\u20136.5 keV core\nof the line shown in Fig. 3), both close to the values expected from\nstandard accretion disc models. Within 6rg the emissivity steepens,\nproducing the strong low-energy tail to the line emission, also with\nan equivalent width \u223c200 eV, suggesting additional physics within\nthis region beyond that expected from standard accretion disc mod-\nels (see Wilms et al. 2001). The strong iron line is consistent with\nan enhanced reflection spectrum and an overabundance of iron or\nionization of the disc surface. This last possibility will be examined\nin a later paper.\nThe iron line parameters do, however, depend slightly on the as-\nsumptions made about the complex absorption. In particular all the\nabove models formally assume the effects of ionized absorption\nare negligible above 2.5 keV, which is correct for absorption aris-\ning from low-Z elements (e.g. O) but may not be true if there is\nabsorption by higher-Z elements (e.g. Si, S). A preliminary anal-\nysis allowing for the possibility of Si and S edges did not change\nthe requirement for a strong red wing to the iron line. A detailed\nanalysis of the RGS data will yield constraints on the warm absorp-\ntion (particularly on the low Z elements) and help remove existing\ndegeneracies.\nFuture work to determine the spin must include emission from the\nimmediate plunge region inside the innermost stable orbit (Reynolds\n& Begelman 1997; Agol & Krolik 2000) as well as returning radi-\nation (Martocchia, Matt & Karas 2002).\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nBased on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science\nmission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA\nMember States and the USA (NASA).
