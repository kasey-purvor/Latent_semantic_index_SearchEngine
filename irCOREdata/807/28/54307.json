Despite the obvious importance of spermatozoa to individual 2\nreproductive success a general explanation of variation in 3\nspermatozoan form and function is still lacking. In species with 4\ninternal fertilization, sperm not only have to interact with the 5\nphysical and biochemical environment of the female reproductive 6\ntract, but frequently face competition from the sperm of rival 7\nmales. Both sperm competition theory and adaptation to the 8\nselective environment of the female reproductive tract have been 9\nimplicated in the evolution of spermatozoan morphological 10\ndiversity.11\n2. Using the comparative method, we examine variation in sperm 12\nlength in relation to i) sperm competition intensity (as measured by 13\nrelative testis size) and ii) female reproductive characters, across 14\n15 species of beetle belonging to the family Bruchidae. 15\n3. Stepwise multiple regression within a phylogenetic framework 16\nrevealed sperm length to be positively correlated with female 17\nspermathecal duct length and negatively related to spermathecal 18\nvolume, but not testes size, indicating that the female reproductive 19\nenvironment rather than sperm competition per se exerts selection 20\non sperm length in this taxonomic group. 21\n4. A positive association between testes volume and the volume of 22\nthe female spermatheca was also evident suggesting correlated 23\nevolution of these traits.24\nPage 2 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n3\n5. A number of models of sexual selection could lead to the 1\ncorrelated evolution of male and female reproductive characters, 2\nalthough the underlying mechanisms of cause and effect remain 3\nelusive. Divergence between species (and populations) in 4\nprimary reproductive traits is likely to present a significant barrier 5\nto heterospecific fertilisation, and thus contribute to reproductive 6\nisolation.7\n8\n9\n10\nKeywords: Callosobruchus, postcopulatory sexual selection, sperm, 11\nspermathecal duct, comparative method.12\nPage 3 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n4\nIntroduction1\nAcross insect species, sperm morphology is extremely diverse2\n(Jamieson 1987), suggesting rapid and divergent evolution of this 3\ncharacter.  Parker (1982) was the first to theorise that post-copulatory 4\nsexual selection, in the form of sperm competition, should favour the 5\nproduction of numerous tiny sperm, as observed in the field cricket 6\nGryllus bimaculatus (Gage & Morrow 2003). However, positive 7\nrelationships between sperm length and sperm competition risk have 8\nbeen reported in a variety of taxa.   In a comparative study of 25 butterfly 9\nspecies, the length of eupyrene (fertilising), but not apyrene (non-10\nfertilising), sperm was found to increase with the degree of female 11\nmultiple mating, inferred from spermatophore counts of wild-caught 12\nfemales (Gage 1994).   Using testis size as an alternative indirect 13\nmeasure of sperm competition risk, Morrow & Gage (2000) found a 14\nsimilar relationship in moths, but in this group, the length of both sperm 15\ntypes increased with sperm competition risk.  Similar positive 16\nrelationships between sperm length and sperm competition risk have17\nbeen reported in birds (Briskie, Montgomerie & Birkhead 1997), 18\nnematodes (LaMunyon & Ward 1998, 1999), and mammals (Gomendio & 19\nRoldan 1991; although this has been refuted by Gage & Freckleton 20\n2003), whilst across species of fish, sperm length was found to be 21\nnegatively related to the intensity of sperm competition (Stockley et al.22\n1997). Hosken (1997), studying bats found no relationship between 23\nsperm size and sperm competition intensity.24\nPage 4 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n5\n  Within species, LaMunyon & Ward (2002) found that in the 1\nnematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the size of sperm from males from 2\nartificial lines, genetically induced to have high levels of sperm 3\ncompetition, increased by nearly 20% after 60 generations of selection 4\ncompared to the sperm of control-line males (LaMunyon & Ward 2002).   5\nIn this species, larger sperm have been shown to crawl faster and 6\ndisplace smaller sperm (from the spermathecae), thereby taking 7\nprecedence at fertilisation (LaMunyon & Ward 1998). By way of contrast, 8\nin Drosophila melanogaster, Pitnick et al. (2001) found no evidence that 9\nselection for monogamy altered sperm length.10\nDirectional selection via sperm competition alone ignores the 11\nreproductive interests of females.   Female reproductive morphology is 12\noften exceedingly complex and there is growing evidence that processes 13\nsuch as transport of sperm to and from the female sperm storage organs 14\nare at least partly under female control (Eberhard 1996), and thus female 15\nreproductive characters are likely to exert selection on sperm morphology 16\n(Eady 2001). A number of comparative studies have demonstrated 17\ncorrelations between sperm morphology and areas of the female 18\nreproductive tract, consistent with female-mediated selection on sperm 19\nmorphology. In featherwing beetles (Dybas & Dybas 1981), moths 20\n(Morrow & Gage 2000) and scathophagid flies (Minder, Hosken & Ward 21\n2005), sperm length has been shown to correlate positively with the 22\nlength of the ducts leading to the sperm storage organs. Sperm length 23\nhas also been shown to correlate positively with the size of the female 24\nsperm storage site in featherwing beetles (Dybas & Dybas 1981), stalk-25\nPage 5 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n6\neyed flies (Presgraves, Baker & Wilkinson 1999) and Drosophila (Pitnick, 1\nMarkow & Spicer 1999). These findings suggest that evolved differences2\nin sperm morphology are adaptations in response to changes in the 3\ndimensions of the female reproductive tract, with the value of such 4\nadaptations being particularly important during sperm competition (Pitnick 5\net al. 1999; Morrow & Gage 2000).   6\nHere, we use the comparative method of analysing 7\nphylogenetically independent contrasts (Felsenstein 1985) to investigate 8\nwhether sperm length is associated with testes size (an accepted indirect 9\nmeasure of sperm competition risk; Morrow & Gage 2000) and\/or 10\ndimensions of the female reproductive tract, across 15 species of bruchid 11\nbeetle (Bruchidae).   In the Bruchidae, sperm are usually transferred to 12\nthe female via a spermatophore deposited in the female\u2019s bursa 13\ncopulatrix (Zabrotes subfaciatus does not appear to transfer a 14\nspermatophore;  personal observation).   Following copulation, sperm 15\nmigrate from the spermatophore, through the spermathecal duct, to a 16\nchitinised spermatheca where they are stored until they are \u2018moved\u2019 back 17\nthrough the spermathecal duct to the site of fertilisation.   Under a 18\ncoevolutionary scenario, sperm length may exhibit correlated evolution 19\nwith any one of these regions of the female reproductive tract.20\n21\nMethods22\n(a) Species:  collection & culturing23\nCollection details for each species (where known) are presented in 24\nTable 1.   Species  were transported to Sunderland as egg\/larvae 25\nPage 6 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n7\ninfested seeds and immediately placed in small aerated plastic boxes 1\nand kept in a constant temperature environment at 27oC and 35% r.h., 2\nwith a 12L:12D photoperiod (host plant seeds of Kytorhinus sharpianus3\nwere first incubated at 10oC for 4 weeks in order to break larval diapause;  4\nIshihara & Shimada 1995).   A few days prior to eclosion seeds were 5\nisolated in cell trays and subsequent emergent beetles isolated and 6\nidentified.   Virgins were used wherever possible to control for mating 7\nhistory and only first generation adults were used.   All host plant material 8\nwas destroyed 6 weeks after it was first received at Sunderland.   One 9\nexception to this procedure was Bruchus rufimanus, specimens of which 10\nwere collected in the field as adults and so their mating history was 11\nunknown (although the spermatheca of all three females contained 12\nsperm).13\n(b) Microdissection and data collection14\nThree days post eclosion, beetles were euthanised and dissected in 15\ninsect saline.   Digital images of male and female characters (see below)16\nwere captured using a Sony DXC-390P 3CCD colour video camera 17\nmounted on an Olympus SZH10 binocular microscope or Zeiss phase 18\ncontrast microscope (used to measure sperm length), and measured 19\nusing NIH Image (Scion Corporation).   Length of the right elytron was 20\nalso measured for all beetles, being an accepted correlate of body mass 21\nin Callosobruchus maculatus (Wilson & Hill 1989).   To check this 22\nrelationship held at the level of family, male beetles were also weighed, 23\neither individually or as a \u2018species batch\u2019, within 24 h of eclosion.24\nPage 7 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n8\nMeasurement repeatability was estimated in C. maculatus via the intra-1\nclass correlation coefficient. All female traits (see below) were measured 2\n3x\u2019s across 6 females, whilst in males, the repeatability of sperm size 3\nwas estimated within an individual male by measuring 10 separate sperm 4\n3x\u2019s and across males by measuring 10 separate sperm each, from 8 5\nmales.  The repeatability of testes volume was estimated by measuring 6\ntestes 3x\u2019s across 9 males.7\nMale traits. The two pairs of spherical testes were dissected out of 8\neach male and placed on a \u2018Thomas Buerker\u2019 haemocytometer and 9\nflattened, using a coverslip, to a depth of 0.1 mm.   The flattened area of 10\neach testis was measured and used to calculate total testes volume.    11\nMature sperm were recovered from the spermathecae of females, 12\napproximately 4h after a single copulation with a virgin male.   Individual 13\nspermathecae were dissected free and transferred to cavity slides 14\ncontaining 40 \u00b5l insect saline.   Sperm were expelled by gently squeezing 15\nthe spermatheca with watchmaker\u2019s forceps in a series of soft pulses.   16\nThis method ejected sperm through the severed spermathecal duct.   The 17\nspermatheca was removed and the sperm solution mixed for 2 min using 18\nthe tips of the forceps.   A single drop of solution was transferred to a 19\nglass microscope slide and covered with a glass coverslip.   The overall 20\nlength and head length of the first three sperm encountered was 21\nmeasured from each dissection.22\nFemale traits.   The bursa copulatrix with the spermatheca still attached 23\nby its associated duct was carefully removed from virgin females.   24\nSpermathecal duct length was measured along its entire central axis from 25\nPage 8 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n9\nits junction with the spermatheca to where it joins the oviduct.   1\nBruchidaean spermathecae are elongated, cylindrical, tapered and 2\ncurved (Mukerji & Chatterjee 1951).   Assuming the spermatheca to be a 3\ncoiled cone, we estimated its volume as Pi x mean radius x length.  The 4\nmean radius was estimated by measuring the longitudinal area of the 5\nspermatheca and dividing it by twice the length of the line traced down 6\nthe central axis of the organ.   Dry weight, as a measure of size of the 7\nbursa copulatrix (Morrow & Gage 2000), was rejected because it would 8\nnot take into account differences in the thickness of the bursal walls or 9\nthe presence of bursal valves and\/or various sclerotised structures.   10\nThus, the volume of the bursa copulatrix was estimated in a similar 11\nmanner to that of the spermatheca, although we appreciate this still fails 12\nto take into account the thickness of the bursal wall.13\n(c) Comparative and statistical analysis14\nFelsenstein\u2019s (1985) method of comparing phylogentically independent 15\ncontrasts was used to test for correlated evolution among characters.   16\nThe phylogenetic relationships between the species examined in this 17\nstudy (Figure 1) were derived from an extensive systematic analysis of 18\n165 species, generated from the entire Cytochrome Oxidase 1 19\nmitochondrial gene, the D2-D3 expansion segment of 28S nuclear 20\nribosomal DNA, and partial taxonomic sampling (86 species) of an 800bp 21\nexon of elongation-factor-1\u0001 and approximately 1000bp of 18S nuclear 22\nribosomal DNA (Geoff Morse, unpublished data). The Callosobruchus 23\nphylogeny was resolved according to Tuda et al. (2006). Morphological 24\ndata were log10-transformed before analysis to normalise the25\nPage 9 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n10\ndistributions, and standardised independent contrasts were calculated 1\nfrom the log10-transformed phenotypic values using the Comparative 2\nAnalysis by Independent Contrasts (CAIC v. 2.6.8b) program of Purvis & 3\nRambault (1995).   Branch lengths were set equal.   These standardised 4\nindependent contrasts were then tested for correlated evolution by fitting 5\nleast-square (multiple) regressions forced through the origin, and thus, 6\nsample sizes represent the number of independent contrasts. Where the 7\nevolutionary assumptions of CAIC were violated (i.e. a significant 8\nrelationship between the absolute contrast value and the nodal mean), 9\nweighted regression through the origin was employed (Purvis & 10\nRambault 1995).11\n12\nResults13\nInterspecific variation14\nAcross the Bruchidae, substantial variation was found in the parameters 15\nmeasured (Table 2). That these measures represent accurate estimates 16\nof mean species level traits can be ascertained from an analysis of trait 17\nrepeatability carried out on Callosobruchus maculatus (Table 3).18\nComparison of independent contrasts (Table 4) confirmed that across the 19\nBruchidae, male elytron length was a good predictor of male mass, testes 20\nsize and female elytron length, but not sperm length or sperm head 21\nlength. Female elytron length was positively related to bursal volume, 22\nspermathecal mid-line length and spermathecal volume, but not 23\nspermathecal duct length (Table 5). We do not attempt to control for24\nallometric effects by calculating residuals (which may be biased), since 25\nPage 10 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n11\ninclusion of body size in multiple regression analysis achieves this 1\n(Freckleton 2002).2\n3\nCorrelated evolution of reproductive traits4\nCorrelated evolution between male and female traits was analysed using 5\nweighted multiple regression through the origin on independent contrasts6\nin trait variables. In the following analyses the maximal models included 7\nfemale elytron length, bursal volume, spermathecal duct length and 8\nspermathecal volume. Backward deletion from the maximal model, based 9\non changes in R2 revealed sperm length to be unrelated to bursal volume 10\n(\u0002R2 = 0.019, F1, 10 = 0.89, p = 0.37). The minimal model revealed sperm 11\nlength to be positively related to spermathecal duct length (B = 0.74, t = 12\n5.05, p < 0.0001) and female elytra length (B = 0.48, t = 2.69, p = 0.02) 13\nand negatively related to spermathecal volume (B = -87.35, t = 4.24, p < 14\n0.001). In a separate multiple regression analysis in which male elytron 15\nlength was included, sperm length was found to be unrelated to testes 16\nsize (\u0002R2 = 0.21, F1,11 = 3.82, p = 0.078).17\nBackward elimination from the maximal model revealed sperm head 18\nlength to be unrelated to spermathecal volume (\u0002R2 = 0.002, F1,10 = 0.04, 19\np = 0.85) or spermathecal duct length (\u0002R2 = 0.09, F1,11 = 0.21, p = 0.66). 20\nElimination of these two variables revealed the minimal model, in which 21\nsperm head length was negatively related to bursal volume (B = -0.018, t 22\n= 3.52, p < 0.004) and positively related to female elytron length (B = 23\n0.012, t = 2.81, p < 0.016).24\nPage 11 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n12\nIn the analysis of testes size, male elytron length was included in1\nthe maximal model as this covaried with testes volume. Backward 2\nelimination revealed testes size to be unrelated to female elytra length 3\n(\u0002R2 = 0.014, F1,9 = 4.7,  p = 0.056), but positively related to male elytron 4\nlength (B = 0.82, t = 5.56, p < 0.0001), spermathecal volume (B = 91.1, t 5\n= 2.7, p = 0.022), spermathecal duct length (B = 0.602, t = 3.93, p = 6\n0.003) and negatively to bursal volume (B = -0.99, t = 3.86, p = 0.003).7\n8\nDiscussion9\nA number of studies have shown sperm length to be positively associated 10\nwith sperm competition intensity (Gage 1994; Morrow & Gage 2000; 11\nBriskie, Montgomerie & Birkhead 1997; LaMunyon & Ward 1998, 1999, 12\n2002), a common measure of the latter being relative testis size (e.g.,13\nMorrow & Gage 2000;  Hosken & Ward 2001).   However, the present 14\nstudy, which controlled for any effect of body size on testes size by 15\nincluding both variables in a multiple regression model, found no 16\nrelationship between sperm length and testes size suggesting that 17\nintensity of sperm competition is not a major factor in the evolution of 18\nsperm length in the Bruchidae.   Instead, our results suggest that in the 19\nBruchidae, sperm length has coevolved with female spermathecal duct 20\nlength and spermathecal volume respectively. 21\nRapid coevolution between sperm length and seminal receptacle 22\nlength has been documented in Drosophila melanogaster in which female 23\nseminal receptacle length was exposed to artificial selection for either 24\nlong or short duct length (Miller & Pitnick 2002). In this species, 25\nPage 12 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n13\nfertilization success is in part determined by the interaction between 1\nsperm length and seminal receptacle length, such that long sperm tend to 2\nfunction better within the reproductive tracts of females with long seminal 3\nreceptacle lengths. Thus, seminal receptacle length selects for sperm 4\nlength. A similar scenario might occur in relation to spermathecal duct 5\nlength and sperm length. Indeed, Werner et al. (2007) have shown that 6\nthe spermatozoa of Drusilla canaliculata (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) 7\ninteract with the spermathecal duct to gain progressive motility.8\nWhat drives the evolution of spermathecal duct length or indeed 9\nany part of the female reproductive tract that alters sperm efficiency at 10\nfertilization is open to conjecture.   For example, variation in 11\nspermathecal duct length may arise as a result of natural selection, 12\nsexual selection, genetic drift and\/or pleiotropy. Such female biases over 13\npaternity may be considered analogous to the sensory biases (or sensory 14\ndrives, Boughman 2002) observed in precopulatory displays (Ryan et al.15\n1990) and may represent the starting point for a host of mechanisms of 16\nsexual selection including Fisherian (Morrow & Gage 2000) and good 17\ngene mechanisms (Pitnick et al. 1999). Such female biases are also a 18\nprerequisite for models of coevolution based on sexual conflict (Rice 19\n1996; Rice & Holland 1997; Pitnick et al. 1999). Longer sperm 20\n(possibly because of its increased contact area with the walls of the 21\nspermathecal duct;  Morrow & Gage 2000) may benefit males through its 22\nimproved ability to displace, or resist displacement by, the sperm of rival 23\nmales (Dybas & Dybas 1981; Presgraves et al. 1999), but such male 24\n\u2018control\u2019 may prove costly to females.   For instance, females may mate 25\nPage 13 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n14\nmultiply to gain a mixture of sperm from different males, thereby avoiding 1\nthe costs of genetic incompatibility (Zeh & Zeh 1997;  Treganza & Wedell 2\n2002).   Under this scenario, the effectiveness of long sperm may have a 3\ndetrimental effect on female fitness (since females may be stuck with 4\nsperm from a genetically incompatible male).   Therefore, females may 5\nbe counter-selected to increase spermathecal duct length so as to 6\nincrease access of other ejaculates (Pitnick et al. 1999).   The result of 7\nthis conflict is an evolutionary arms race with ever lengthening sperm and 8\nspermathecal ducts, resulting in correlated evolution of the two traits.   9\nUnder any of these mechanisms of sexual selection, extension of sperm 10\nbeyond some critical length is likely to be opposed by the increased costs 11\nof producing longer sperm (Pitnick, Markow & Spicer 1995;  Pitnick 12\n1996).   This critical length may correspond with the length of the 13\nspermathecal duct, since the wall area of the spermathecal duct with 14\nwhich the sperm can contact, and ther fore the advantages of increased 15\nsperm length, are finite (Morrow & Gage 2000).16\nWhilst the exact mechanisms that produce correlated evolution in 17\ntraits such as sperm length and spermathecal duct length remain elusive 18\ntheir divergence will almost certainly contribute to reproductive isolation 19\nbetween populations.   The prevalence of conspecific sperm precedence 20\nsupports this idea at a species level (Bella et al. 1992;  Gregory & 21\nHoward 1994;  Wade et al. 1994;  Price 1997;  Howard 1999;  Rugman-22\nJones & Eady 2007), whilst patterns of sperm precedence revealed by 23\nintraspecific (between population) sperm competition studies (Brown & 24\nEady 2001;  Hosken, Blanckenhorn & Garner 2002;  Nilsson, Fricke & 25\nPage 14 of 31Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n15\nArnqvist 2002, 2003;  Rugman-Jones 2003), may also reflect 1\ncoevolutionary divergence in sperm and female reproductive tract 2\nmorphology between populations (Eady 2001). 3\nAlthough testes size was not associated with sperm length, testes4\nsize was positively associated with spermathecal volume and 5\nspermathecal duct length. A similar relationship exists in moths (Morrow 6\n& Gage 2000) and scathophagid flies (Minder et al. 2005).   Since testis 7\nsize is commonly associated with male reproductive investment 8\n(Simmons 2001), it may be inferred that an evolved increase in 9\nspermathecal volume results in selection upon males to produce bigger 10\nejaculates, and\/or more sperm (requiring bigger testes) to fill and\/or flush 11\nprevious ejaculates from the spermatheca (Morrow & Gage 2000). At 12\nany given time following copulation, the number of sperm in storage 13\n(influenced by rates of sperm use and passive sperm loss) may affect 14\nfemale remating decisions and subsequent paternity (Parker 1993; Eady, 15\nRugman-Jones & Brown 2004). In insects, ejaculate size is thought to 16\nbe a major determinant of female remating (Ridley 1988; Simmons 2001)17\nand several studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between 18\nejaculate size and female remating intervals in bruchids (Eady 1995; 19\nMbata, Shu & Ramaswamy 1997;  Savalli & Fox 1999).   Since delaying 20\nfemale remating is an important component of male post-copulatory 21\nreproductive success (Ridley 1988;  Andr\u00e9s & Arnqvist 2001;  Simmons 22\n2001), any evolutionary increase in the size of the female sperm storage 23\norgan may result in selection on males to produce more sperm, resulting 24\nin the evolution of larger testes.   25\nPage 15 of 31 Functional Ecology\nFor Peer Review\n16\n1\nAcknowledgements2\nWe are greatly indebted to Dan Johnson, without whose enthusiasm and 3\ncooperation we could not have accessed many of the species used in 4\nthis study and Geoff Morse for his generous help with the phylogeny.   5\nWe also thank Peter Credland, Dragana Milanovic, John Kingsolver, 6\nBecky Ward, Helen Pearson, Michihiro Ishihara, M.
