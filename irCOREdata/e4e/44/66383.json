have provided an enduring interest for a generation of physicists and mathe-\nmaticians. On the physics side, instanton configurations give the leading non-perturbative contributions\nto the functional integral in the semi-classical approximation [2]. After the initial disappointment that\ninstantons were not going to provide a simple explanation of quark confinement, they have proved\ninteresting and useful both in phenomenological models of QCD (see, for example [3\u20135]) and for de-\nscribing exact non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories (as we describe in this\nreview). On the mathematical side, instantons lie at the heart of some important recent developments\nin topology and, in particular, of Donaldson\u2019s construction of topological invariants of four-manifolds\n(see [6] and references therein).\nThe main applications of instantons we will consider in this review are to supersymmetric gauge\ntheories. Recent developments have provided an extraordinary web of exact non-perturbative results\nfor these theories, making them an ideal field-theoretical laboratory in which to test our ideas about\nstrongly-coupled gauge dynamics. Highlights include Seiberg duality for N = 1 theories, the Seiberg-\nWitten solution of N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills and the AdS\/CFT correspondence. Typically\nsupersymmetry constrains the form of quantum corrections allowing exact results to be obtained for\nsome special quantities. Despite these constraints, supersymmetric gauge theories still exhibit many\ninteresting physical phenomena including quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Yang-Mills\ninstantons have played an important ro\u02c6le in some of these developments which we will review in the\nfollowing.\nInstantons in supersymmetric gauge theories were studied in detail by several groups in the 1980\u2019s.\nThis early work focused on the contribution of a single instanton in theories with N = 1 supersymmetry.\nImpressive results were obtained for the vacuum structure of these theories, including exact formulae\nfor condensates of chiral operators. Although precise numerical answers were obtained, interest in\nthese was limited as there was nothing with which to compare them.1 The new developments motivate\n1Note however, that several puzzles emerged on comparing numerical values for condensates obtained using different\n6\nthe extension of the instanton calculus to theories with extended supersymmetry and, in particular,\nto instantons of arbitrary topological charge. This is the main goal of the first part of this review.\nDevelopments such as Seiberg-Witten theory and the AdS\/CFT correspondence also yield precise pre-\ndictions for instanton effects, which can be checked explicitly using the methods we will develop below.\nThese applications, which are described in the second half of the review are important for two reasons.\nFirstly, they provide as a quantitative test of conjectural dualities which underlie the recent progress in\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. Secondly, they also increase our confidence in weak-coupling instanton\ncalculations and some of the technology which they require such as Wick rotation to Euclidean space,\nconstrained instantons, etc.\nA semi-classical evaluation of the path integral requires us to find the complete set of finite-action\nconfigurations which minimize the Euclidean action. In pure Yang-Mills theory, this was accomplished\nmany years ago in pioneering work by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin (ADHM) [7]. In partic-\nular, these authors found the complete set of self-dual gauge fields of arbitrary topological charge k.\nTheir construction, which works for arbitrary SU(N), SO(N) or Sp(N) gauge groups (but not for the\nexceptional groups), reduces the self-dual Yang-Mills equation to a set of non-linear algebraic equations\n(the \u201cADHM constraints\u201d) constraining a matrix of parameters (the \u201cADHM data\u201d). After modding\nout a residual symmetry group, each solution of the ADHM constraints defines a gauge-inequivalent,\nk-instanton configuration. The space of such solutions, which we denote Mk, is also known as the\nk-instanton moduli space.\nThe space Mk, has many remarkable properties which will play a central ro\u02c6le in our story. Firstly,\napart from having some isolated singularities, it is a Riemannian manifold with a natural metric. The\nsingularities are relatively mild, being of conical type, and have a natural interpretation as points where\ninstantons shrink to zero size. In addition, the moduli space carries families of inequivalent complex\nstructures and, when endowed with its natural metric, defines a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold. This property is\nmanifest in the ADHM construction, which is actually an example of a general method for constructing\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler spaces known as the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient. This viewpoint turns out to be very useful\nand we will find that many of the structures which emerge in the semi-classical analysis of the path\nintegral have a nice geometrical interpretations in terms of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient.\nApplying the semi-classical approximation to a Green\u2019s function requires us to replace the fields\nby their ADHM values and then integrate over the moduli space Mk. Constructing the appropriate\nmeasure for this integration, both in pure gauge theory and its supersymmetric generalizations, is the\nmain problem we address in the first part of the review. The main obstacle to overcome is the fact the\nADHM constraints cannot generally be solved except for small values of k. Hence, we cannot find an\nexplicit unconstrained parameterization of the moduli space. However, we will be able to find explicit\nformulae for the measure in terms of the ADHM data together with Lagrange multiplier fields which\nimpose the ADHM equations as \u03b4-function constraints. Under certain circumstances we will be able\nto evaluate the the moduli space integrals even for general k. For instance at large-N the ADHM\nconstraints can be solved, at least on a certain generic region of the moduli space, and this means that\nthe instanton calculus becomes tractable for arbitrary k. In the final Chapter we shall briefly explain\napproaches to instanton calculations. These will be re-examined in Chapter IV\n7\nimportant new developments that allow one to make progress even at finite N when one is on a Higgs\nor Coulomb branch.\nThe plan of this report is as follows. As a prelude we briefly review the basic philosophy of instanton\ncalculations. Chapter II provides a solid grounding of the ADHM construction of instantons in SU(N)\ngauge theory.2 Firstly, we describe some general features of instantons. This begins with the notion of\nzero modes in the instanton background, collective coordinates and the moduli space of instantons Mk.\nVery general arguments then show that Mk is a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold with a natural Hermitian metric.\nAfter this, we describe all aspects of the ADHM construction of Mk, putting particular emphasis on the\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient description. Most of the material in Chapter II is necessarily very mathematical.\nA reader primarily interested in physical applications of instantons can skip most of \u00a7II.3.1, \u00a7II.4.1,\n\u00a7II.5 and \u00a7II.6.\nChapter III, shows how the semi-classical limit of the functional integral reduces to an integral over\nMk with a volume form which is derived from the Hermitian metric constructed previously. However,\nin the setting of pure gauge theory, integrating out all the non-zero modes of the quadratic fluctuations\naround the instanton yields a non-trivial determinant factor which accounts for the one-loop effects in\nperturbation theory in the instanton background. We briefly describe, using results reviewed in [8],\nhow the determinants may be evaluated in the ADHM background, although the resulting expressions\nare rather unsatisfactory (involving spacetime integrals). This latter point will not overly concern\nus, because in the supersymmetric applications the non-trivial parts of the determinant factors cancel\nbetween bosons and fermions.\nChapter IV describes how the instanton calculus is generalized in a supersymmetric gauge theory.\nThis is done in the context of N = 1, 2 and 4 supersymmetric theories with no additional matter\nfields. (Adding matter fields is considered separately in \u00a7VI.3.) First of all, we explain how to construct\nthe Euclidean version of the theory by Wick rotation from Minkowski space and how this inevitably\nleads to a theory where the fermion action is not real. This is a fact of life in the supersymmetric\ninstanton calculus, just as it is when fermionic theories are investigated on the lattice, but does not\nlead to any inconsistencies or pathologies. In an instanton background, there are fermion zero modes\nand their associated Grassmann collective coordinates. We show how these are superpartners of the\nbosonic collective coordinates and so in a supersymmetric gauge theory the moduli space Mk is, itself,\nsupersymmetrized. We show how this fits in with the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient approach. In this section,\nwe explain in detail the concept of the super-instanton. In particular, in the N = 4 theory, the\nappropriate supersymmetric instanton solution is only an approximate solution of the equations-of-\nmotion, but one which captures the leading order semi-classical behaviour of the functional integral.\nWe also explain in this section how the addition of VEVs for the scalar fields (for the N = 2 and\n4 theories) leads to Affleck\u2019s notion of a constrained instanton. Our point-of-view is that constrained\ninstantons are\u2014in a sense\u2014only a mild modification of the conventional instanton: some of the collective\ncoordinates cease to be exact moduli and the whole effect can be described by the turning on a potential\non Mk. We call this approximate solution a \u201cquasi-instanton\u201d. Chapter V goes to describe the semi-\nclassical approximation in a supersymmetric gauge theory. In all cases we can formulate the leading-\n2The ADHM construction for the other classical groups is described separately in \u00a7VI.2.\n8\norder semi-classical approximation to the functional integral as an integral over the supersymmetric\nversion of Mk.\nSome generalizations, and other important miscellany, are collected in Chapter VI. In particular,\nwe explain how the ADHM constraints can be solved on generic orbit of the gauge group when N \u2265 2k;\nhow to extend the ADHM construction to gauge groups SO(N) and Sp(N); how to add matter fields\ntransforming in the fundamental representation; the effect of adding masses which break various amounts\nof supersymmetry; and how to define the notion of the instanton partition function.\nChapters VII-IX each describe an application of the multi-instanton calculus. In Chapter VII we\nreview the two distinct approaches to instanton calculus in N = 1 theories developed by different groups\nin the 1980\u2019s. One approach follows closely the methodology developed in the first part of the report,\nworking with constrained instantons in a weakly-coupled Higgs phase. As we review, this approach\nyields explicit agreement with the web of exact results which predict a precise numerical value for the\ngluino condensate in N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. The second, more controversial approach,\nattempts to evaluate the gluino condensate directly in the strongly-coupled confining phase. We cast\nfurther doubt on this method, by showing explicitly that the resulting formulae violate the clustering\nproperty, a general axiom of quantum field theory, and therefore cannot yield the exact answer. This\nis just as one might have expected: instantons are a semi-classical phenomena and as such are not\nexpected to yield quantitatively exact results in a strongly-coupled phase.\nWe then go on in Chapter VIII to consider instanton contributions to the low-energy effective action\nof N = 2 gauge theories on their Coulomb branch. These calculations are very important because\nthey can be compared with a completely different approach based on the celebrated theory of Seiberg\nand Witten. Perfect agreement is found providing strong evidence in favour of the instanton calculus\u2014\nincluding all this entails like the imaginary time formalism and the resulting saddle-point approximation\nof the functional integral\u2014but also in favour of Seiberg and Witten\u2019s ingenious theory. Several minor\nmodifications of the original Seiberg-Witten solution for N = 2 theories with matter are also described.\nThese involve ambiguities in the definition of parameters appearing in the exact solution.\nIn Chapter IX we consider conformal, or finite, gauge theories with N = 2 or N = 4 supersymmetry\nin their non-abelian Coulomb phase. Here, we show how various instanton effects for arbitrary instanton\ncharge can be evaluated exactly in the limit of large N . The large-N instanton calculus that we develop\nprovides substantial evidence in favour of the remarkable AdS\/CFT correspondence which relates the\ngauge theories to ten-dimensional superstring theory on a particular background. In particular we\nwill describe how, even at weak coupling, the large-N instanton calculus probes the background ten-\ndimensional spacetime geometry of the string theory directly.\nIn Chapter X we describe how instantons can be embedded in higher-dimensional theories as brane-\nlike solitons. We show in detail, as expected from general principles, the resulting collective coordinate\ndynamics involves a certain \u03c3-model on the brane world-volume with the moduli space of instantons as\nthe target space. This provides a useful way to understand the relationship of instantons to D-branes in\nsuperstring theory, a subject we go on to describe. Studying instantons in the context of string theory\n9\nprovides a powerful way to derive many aspects of the instanton calculus developed in the previous\nsections and in the process removes much of the cloak of mystery surrounding the ADHM construction.\nFinally, in Chapter XI we describe two recent developments in the instanton calculus. Firstly, how\nthe instanton is modified when the underlying gauge theory is defined on a non-commutative space.\nIt turns out that the instanton moduli space is modified in a particularly natural way. Secondly, we\ndescribe a new calculational technique which promises to make instanton effects tractable even at finite\nN and for all instanton charge. The key idea is that in the presence of scalar field VEVs, a potential\ndevelops on the instanton moduli space and the collective coordinate integrals localize around the critical\npoints of this potential.\nAppendix A details our conventions for spinors in different spacetime dimensions. Appendix B\nincludes an introduction to hyper-Ka\u00a8hler geometry. Appendix C reviews some useful identities for\ncalculations involving the ADHM data.\nThere are many other excellent reviews of instanton physics including [4,9\u201313]; however these reviews\nconcentrate on the single instanton.\nI.1 The philosophy of instanton calculations\nBefore we begin in earnest, it is perhaps useful to remind the reader of the basic philosophy of instanton\ncalculations. In quantum field theory, all information about the physical observables (i.e. the spectrum\nand the S-matrix) can be obtained by calculating the correlation functions of appropriate operators.\nThese correlation functions are defined by the Feynman path integral. The most convenient formulation\nis one where the correlation functions and the path integral are analytically continued to Euclidean\nspacetime. The path integral was first introduced as a formal generating functional for perturbation\ntheory. However, thanks to the work of Wilson, it is widely believed that the Euclidean path integral\nactually provides a first-principles non-perturbative definition of quantum field theory. Implementing\nthis definition in practice involves replacing continuous spacetime by a finite number of points and leads\nto the subject of lattice field theory which is beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the success\nof this viewpoint inspires us to take even the continuum path integral seriously.\nIn continuum quantum field theory we are generally limited to calculating at weak coupling. In four\ndimensions, the only exceptions are certain supersymmetric gauge theories which we will discuss further\nbelow. If the continuum path integral makes any sense at all, then the very least should expect is that\nit should yield sensible calculable answers at weak coupling. As mentioned above, the Feynman rules\nof ordinary weak-coupling perturbation theory can easily be derived from the path integral. However,\neven at weak coupling, the path integral contains much more information, including effects which are\nnon-perturbative in the coupling constant.\n10\nIn the simplest cases, the generating functional in Euclidean spacetime takes the schematic form,\nZ[J ] =\n\u222b\n[d\u03a6] exp\n(\n\u2212 1\ng2\nS[\u03a6] +\n\u222b\nd4x J\u03a6\n)\n, (1.1)\nwhere \u03a6 denotes some set of fields with sources J and S[\u03a6] is the Euclidean action which is real\nand bounded below. The gauge theories we consider below are characterized (classically) by a single\ndimensionless coupling, denoted g2, and one may always re-scale the fields so that the coupling appears\nin front of the action as indicated in (1.1). Of course, in the quantum theory, we will certainly need to\nmodify our discussion to account for the running of the coupling but we will, for the moment, postpone\nthis discussion.\nThe basic idea of the semi-classical approximation3 is that, for small g2, the path integral is domi-\nnated by the configurations of lowest Euclidean action and we may proceed by expanding around these\nconfigurations. The simplest such configurations are the perturbative vacua of the theory (i.e. minima\nof the classical potential) and the corresponding expansion is just the ordinary loop expansion. How-\never the Euclidean action may have other minima with finite action. Such configurations are known\nas instantons the same logic dictates that we should also expand in fluctuations around them. For an\ninstanton of finite Euclidean action Scl, the leading semi-classical contribution goes like exp(\u2212Scl\/g2)\nand expanding in fluctuation leads to corrections which are suppressed by further powers of g2.\nAs we will see, there are many extra complications and technical difficulties in carrying out this\nprogram in practice. As mentioned above, for asymptotically free theories of direct physical interest the\ncoupling g2 runs as a function of the energy and becomes large in the infra-red at the dynamical scale \u039b.\nIn this case, the fluctuations of the fields in the path integral become large and neither the instanton nor\nany other classical field configuration determines the physics. It seems therefore that instantons have\nlittle to tell us directly about these theories. On the other hand there are two types of theory we will\nmeet where instanton methods are directly applicable. Firstly, and most straightforwardly, there are\ntheories like N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory where the \u03b2-function vanishes and the coupling\ndoes not run. In this case we may set g2 \u226a 1 and safely apply semi-classical methods. The second type\nof theory is asymptotically free but also contains scalar fields which can acquire a vacuum expectation\nvalue (VEV) spontaneously breaking the gauge group. The Higgs mechanism then cuts off the running\nof the coupling in the IR. If the mass scale of the VEV is much large than the dynamical scale \u039b, the\ncoupling small at all length scales and semi-classical reasoning is valid.\nIn the case of a non-zero scalar VEV, we will also have to contend with problems related to the\nfact that instantons are no longer true minima of the action. In fact, both types of theory described\nabove requires a more complicated application of the semi-classical method than simply expanding\naround exact solutions of the equations-of-motion. We will frequently solve the classical equations only\napproximately order-by-order in g2. However, the basic philosophy remains the same: as long as the\ntheory is genuinely weakly coupled, an appropriate semi-classical approximation to the path integral\nshould be reliable and we can use it to evaluate the leading non-perturbative corrections to observables.\nIn the following chapters we will develop the necessary technology to accomplish this goal.\n3The term \u201csemi-classical\u201d originates in the observation that g2 appears in the exponent of (1.1) in exactly the same\nposition as Planck\u2019s constant ~ would if we restored physical units. Thus the g2 \u2192 0 limit is identical to the ~\u2192 0 limit.\n11\nII Instantons in Pure Gauge Theory\nIn this Chapter we describe instanton solutions of pure gauge theory, i.e. without any additional fields\npresent. To begin with we introduce the central concept of the moduli space of instantons and describe\nhow this space has a lot structure: it is a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold with singularities. In \u00a7II.4 we describe\nthe Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin construction of arbitrary instanton solutions and then explain\nhow the \u201cADHM construction\u201d can be viewed as a particular example of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient\nconstruction. This point-of-view is necessarily rather mathematical and some of the background required\nis reviewed in Appendix B.\nII.1 Some basic facts\nWe start with pure SU(N) gauge theory described by a Euclidean space action\nS[A] = \u22121\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN F\n2\nmn + i\u03b8k , (2.1)\nwhere the field strength Fmn = \u2202mAn \u2212 \u2202nAm + g[Am, An] and the topological charge is\nk = \u2212 g\n2\n16\u03c02\n\u222b\nd4x trN Fmn\n\u2217Fmn \u2208 Z (2.2)\nwith \u2217Fmn = 12\u01ebmnklFkl. In these conventions, characteristic of the mathematical instanton literature,\nthe gauge field Am is anti-Hermitian and so the covariant derivative is Dm = \u2202m + gAm.\nInstantons are the finite action solutions of the classical equations-of-motion which consequently\nsatisfy a first-order equation. From the inequality\u222b\nd4x trN\n(\nFmn \u00b1 \u2217Fmn\n)2 \u2264 0 , (2.3)\none establishes a lower bound on the real part of the action:\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN F\n2\nmn \u2265\n8\u03c02\ng2\n|k| , (2.4)\nwith equality when the gauge field satisfies the the self-dual, for k > 0, or anti-self-dual, for k < 0,\nYang Mills equations:\n\u2217Fmn \u2261 12\u01ebmnklFkl = \u00b1Fmn . (2.5)\nIn our convention, instantons are the self-dual solutions and carry positive topological (instanton) charge\nk > 0. In contrast, anti-instantons satisfy the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations and carry negative\ntopological charge k < 0. Their action is\nS =\n8\u03c02|k|\ng2\n+ ik\u03b8 =\n{\n\u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 k > 0\n\u22122i\u03c0k\u03c4 \u2217 k < 0 , (2.6)\n12\nwhere we have defined the complex coupling\n\u03c4 =\n4\u03c0i\ng2\n+\n\u03b8\n2\u03c0\n. (2.7)\nIn this review we will discuss exclusively instantons, rather than anti-instantons. The fundamental\nproblem then, and the main subject of \u00a7II.4, is to find all the solutions to (2.5) with a + sign. When\ndiscussing the instanton calculus it is very convenient to introduce a quaternionic notation for four-\ndimensional Euclidean spacetime. The covering group of the SO(4) Euclidean Lorentz group in four\ndimensions is SU(2)L\u00d7SU(2)R. A 4-vector xn can be rewritten as a (2, 2) of this group with components\nx\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 (or x\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1). Here, \u03b1, \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2 are spinor indices of SU(2)L and SU(2)R, respectively. The explicit\nrelation between the two bases is\nx\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = xn\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 , x\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 = xn\u03c3\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\nn , (2.8)\nwhere \u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 are four 2\u00d7 2 matrices \u03c3n = (i~\u03c4 , 1[2]\u00d7[2]), where \u03c4 c, c = 1, 2, 3 are the three Pauli matrices.\nIn addition we define the Hermitian conjugate matrices \u03c3\u00afn \u2261 \u03c3\u2020n = (\u2212i~\u03c4 , 1[2]\u00d7[2]) with components \u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n .4\nAs explicit 2\u00d7 2-dimensional matrices\nx\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\nix3 + x4 ix1 + x2\nix1 \u2212 x2 \u2212ix3 + x4\n)\n, x\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 =\n(\u2212ix3 + x4 \u2212ix1 \u2212 x2\n\u2212ix1 + x2 ix3 + x4\n)\n. (2.9)\nNotice that derivatives are defined in the same way:\n\u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = \u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u2202n , \u2202\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 = \u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n \u2202n . (2.10)\nBut note with this definition \u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 6= \u2202\/\u2202x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9.\nWe now introduce the Lorentz generators,\n\u03c3mn =\n1\n4\n(\u03c3m\u03c3\u00afn \u2212 \u03c3n\u03c3\u00afm) , \u03c3\u00afmn = 14(\u03c3\u00afm\u03c3n \u2212 \u03c3\u00afn\u03c3m) , (2.11)\nwhich are, respectively, self-dual and anti-self-dual:\n\u03c3mn =\n1\n2\n\u01ebmnkl\u03c3kl , \u03c3\u00afmn = \u221212\u01ebmnkl\u03c3\u00afkl . (2.12)\nIn terms of these, we write down, in regular gauge, the explicit one-instanton solution of the SU(2)\ngauge theory, known as the BPST instanton [1], as\nAn = g\n\u221212(x\u2212X)m\u03c3mn\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12 . (2.13)\nNote the identification SU(2) gauge indices and those of SU(2)L introduced above, reflecting the fact\nthat the instanton configuration breaks the product of these groups down to a diagonal subgroup. The\ninstanton gauge-field above depends on five parameters: one scale-size \u03c1 and the four-vector instanton\nposition Xm. Performing global SU(2) gauge-rotations of the right hand side of (2.13) the total number\nof free parameters of a single-instanton solution becomes eight. This is the first example of the emergence\n4Notice that indices are raised and lowered with the \u01eb-tensor defined in Appendix A: x\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9x\u03b2\u03b2\u02d9 .\n13\nof instanton collective coordinates. We will see that in general a k-instanton solution in the SU(N)\ntheory will contain 4kN collective coordinates (for the SU(2) theory and k = 1 we have 4kN = 8). It\nis straightforward to see that the corresponding field-strength\nFmn = g\n\u22121 4\u03c1\n2\u03c3mn(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)2 , (2.14)\nis self-dual. The anti-instanton is obtained from expressions above via a substitution \u03c3mn \u2192 \u03c3\u00afmn.\nNote that the BPST instanton (2.13) is a non-singular expression which falls off at large distances\nas 1\/x. This slow fall off would make it difficult to construct square-integrable quantities involving\ninstanton gauge fields (see [2] for more detail). An elegant and straightforward resolution of this tech-\nnical problem is to gauge-transform the regular instanton (2.13) with a singular gauge transformation\nU(x) = \u03c3\u00afm(x\u2212X)m\/|x\u2212X|. The resulting expression for the instanton in singular gauge is\nAn = g\n\u22121 2\u03c1\n2(x\u2212X)m\u03c3\u00afmn\n(x\u2212X)2((x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12) . (2.15)\nNote in singular gauge the SU(2) gauge indices are identified with SU(2)R indices in contrast to the\nexpression in regular gauge. This expression falls off as 1\/x3 at large distances which improves the\nconvergence of various integrals.5 Hence, from now on we will always assume that all the multi-instanton\nsolutions we are dealing with are written in singular gauge. The price to pay for this is the apparent\nsingularity of the solution (2.15) at the instanton centre xm = Xm. However, this singularity is not a\nproblem, since it is, by construction, removable by a gauge transformation. A rigorous way of dealing\nwith a singular gauge transformation is to introduce it on a punctured Euclidean space with the singular\npoint(s) being removed. Then the singular-gauge instanton remains regular on the punctured space.\nNote that the punctures contribute to the boundary, hence the integrals of total derivatives, such as\nthe instanton charge (2.2), will receive contributions from these punctures.\nII.2 Collective coordinates and moduli space\nOne of the key concepts associated to instantons (and more generally to solitons) is the idea of a\nmoduli space of solutions . For instantons, this is the space of inequivalent solutions of the self-dual\nYang-Mills equations (2.5). Since we are dealing with a gauge theory, the word \u201cinequivalent\u201d requires\nsome clarification. It is most convenient to think of \u201cinequivalent\u201d as being equivalence up to local\ngauge transformations. So, for instance, solutions differing by global gauge transformation will be\ndeemed inequivalent to each other. The reason for the distinction between local and global gauge\ntransformations is discussed in [9]. In the present context the main point is simply that the usual\ncovariant gauge fixing condition does not fix global gauge transformations and hence we must still\nintegrate over the corresponding orbits in the path integral. If one is calculating a correlation function\nof gauge-invariant operators, this integral simply leads to an additional factor of the volume of the\ngauge group.\n5The fast fall off of the singular gauge is also required for applying the LSZ reduction formulae to various Green\nfunctions in the instanton background.\n14\nIt will turn out that the moduli space of instantons has a lot of mathematical structure, but for the\nmoment, there are two properties that are paramount. Firstly, since finite action classical solutions of\ngauge theories on four-dimensional Euclidean space are classified by the topological (instanton) charge\n(2.2), the moduli space must contain distinct components describing the inequivalent solutions for each\ntopological charge k. When the gauge group is SU(N) (or U(N) since the abelian factor makes no\ndifference to the instanton solutions on a commutative Euclidean space) we will denote the moduli\nspace of instantons with topological charge k as Mk. The second property that these moduli spaces\nhave is that they are manifolds, a fact which is not a priori obvious. Strictly speaking, as we shall see\nlater, they have conical-type singularities (which occur physically when instantons shrink to zero size)\nand so we will use the term manifold in a slightly looser sense to encompass spaces with these kinds\nof features. We shall also see that Mk has even more structure: it is a complex manifold of a very\nparticular type known as a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold.\nSince the moduli space is a manifold, albeit with singularities, we can introduce local coordinates\nto label its points. The coordinates on the moduli space label various collective properties of the gauge\nfield and are therefore called collective coordinates. So the gauge fields of the instanton An(x;X) depend\nnot only on the coordinates on R4, xn, but also on a set of collective coordinates that we denote X\n\u00b5,\n\u00b5 = 1, 2, . . . , dimMk. Some of the collective coordinates have an obvious physical interpretation; for\ninstance, if we have have a given instanton solution, then since the solution is localized in R4 it has a\ndefinable notion of centre. We can obviously translate the whole configuration in R4 and so there must\nbe collective coordinates that specify the position of the centre which we denote as Xn, n = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nNotice that, by symmetry, the gauge fields can only depend on these coordinates through the difference\nxn \u2212Xn. To reflect this, the moduli space Mk is a product\nMk = R\n4 \u00d7 M\u0302k . (2.16)\nThe component M\u0302k, with the centre factored out, is known as the centred moduli space.\nNotice that the collective coordinates Xn arise because, by its very nature, a given instanton solution\nbreaks the translational symmetry of the theory. Another way to say this is that the subspace spanned\nby the collective coordinates Xn around a given point in the moduli space can be generated by acting\non the instanton solution with the group elements of the broken symmetry. In this case the symmetry\nin question are translations in spacetime. So if TX = \u2212Xn\u2202\/\u2202xn are the generators of translations, then\nAn(x;X, . . .) = e\nTXAn(x; 0, . . .) = An(x\u2212X; 0, . . .) . (2.17)\nThis is all quite trivial for the translational collective coordinates; however, it illustrates a general\nprinciple: there are collective coordinates associated to all the symmetries of the gauge theory that\nare broken by a given instanton solution. However, not all symmetries of the gauge theory give in-\nequivalent collective coordinates and not all collective coordinates correspond to broken symmetries:\nindeed typically the majority do not. Another way to phrase this is that the symmetries of the classical\nequations-of-motion are realized as symmetries of the moduli space and different symmetries may sweep\nout the same subspace of the moduli space while some symmetries may act trivially on (leave invariant)\nthe moduli space. Finally, there may be some directions in the moduli space, and typically the majority,\nthat are not related to any symmetry.\n15\nWe now describe the symmetries of our theory. First of all, we have spacetime symmetries including\nthe Poincare\u00b4 symmetry of four-dimensional Euclidean space. However, classical gauge theory is actu-\nally invariant under the larger group that includes conformal transformations. In all, this group has\nfifteen generators which includes four translations, six rotations, four special conformal transformations\ngenerated by\n\u03b4xn = 2xn(x \u00b7 \u01eb)\u2212 \u01ebnx2 , (2.18)\nwhere \u01ebn is an infinitesimal four-vector, and dilatations \u03b4xn = \u03b1xn. In quaternionic language where the\nvector xn is represented as the 2\u00d7 2 matrix x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 in (2.9), the action of the whole conformal group can\nbe written elegantly as\nx\u2192 x\u2032 = (Ax+B)(Cx+D)\u22121 , det\n(\nA B\nC D\n)\n= 1 , (2.19)\nwhere A, B, C and D are quaternions. Notice that there are fifteen variables in the transformation\n(2.19), matching the dimension of the conformal group. As well as these spacetime symmetries, there\nare global gauge transformations in our chosen gauge group SU(N). Some of these symmetries will,\nlike translations, be broken by an instanton solution, and consequently be realized non-trivially on the\nmoduli space.\nAnother key concept that is related to idea of a collective coordinate is the notion of a zero mode.\nSuppose that An(x) is an instanton solution. Consider some small fluctuation An(x) + \u03b4An(x) around\nthis solution which is also a solution of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations (2.5). To linear order\nDm\u03b4An \u2212Dn\u03b4Am = \u01ebmnklDk\u03b4Al . (2.20)\nThere are actually three independent equations here, manifested by writing them in quaternionic form:\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 \/\u00afD\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1\u03b4A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 , (2.21)\nwhere ~\u03c4 are the three Pauli matrices and we define the covariant derivatives in the quaternionic basis\nas\n\/D \u2261 \u03c3nDn , \/\u00afD \u2261 \u03c3\u00afnDn . (2.22)\nWe must also fix the gauge in some way to weed out the variations that are just local gauge transfor-\nmations rather than genuine physical variations of the instanton solution. This is conveniently achieved\nby demanding that all fluctuations, including the zero modes, are orthogonal to gauge transformations.\nHere, orthogonality is defined in a functional sense by means of the inner product on adjoint-valued\n(anti-Hermitian) variations\n\u3008\u03b4An, \u03b4\u2032An\u3009 = \u22122\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4An(x)\u03b4\n\u2032An(x) . (2.23)\nImplicitly, we are discussing fluctuations which are square-integrable with respect to this inner product.\nSo if \u03b4An is orthogonal to a gauge transformation,\n\u222b\nd4x trN Dn\u2126 \u03b4An = 0, then by integrating-by-parts\nDn\u03b4An = 0 . (2.24)\nAgain it is quite instructive to write this in quaternionic form:\n\/\u00afD\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u03b4A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (2.25)\n16\nThe conditions for a zero mode, (2.21) and (2.25), can then be written as a single quaternion equation:\n\/\u00afD\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u03b4A\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9 = 0 . (2.26)\nWe recognize this as the covariant Weyl equation for a Weyl spinor \u03c8\u03b1 = \u03b4A\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9 in the instanton\nbackground. Due to the free \u03b2\u02d9 index each gauge zero mode actually corresponds to two independent\nsolutions of the Weyl equation.\nThe fluctuations \u03b4An(x) satisfying (2.20) and (2.24), or (2.26), are then \u201czero modes\u201d in the sense\nthat they represent physical fluctuations in field space which do not change the value of the action.\nNon-zero mode fluctuations necessarily increase the action of the instanton solution. To quadratic order\naround the instanton solution, one finds\nS[A] = \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 +\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4Am(D2\u03b4mn + 2gFmn)\u03b4An + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n= \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4A\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u2206(+)\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b4A\u03b2\u03b1\u02d9 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n(2.27)\nwhere we have defined the fluctuation operator \u2206(+), and, for future use, a companion \u2206(\u2212):\n\u2206(+) \u2261 \u2212 \/D \/\u00afD = \u22121[2]\u00d7[2]D2 \u2212 gFmn\u03c3mn , (2.28a)\n\u2206(\u2212) \u2261 \u2212 \/\u00afD \/D = \u22121[2]\u00d7[2]D2 \u2212 gFmn\u03c3\u00afmn . (2.28b)\nThe equality between the two expressions in (2.27) is established by using the fact that \u03c3mn is a projector\nonto self-dual tensors (A.9). In addition, in an instanton (as opposed to an anti-instanton) background,\nthe second term in \u2206(\u2212) vanishes; hence\n\u2206(\u2212) = \u22121[2]\u00d7[2]D2 . (2.29)\nThe two operators \u2206(\u00b1) play an important ro\u02c6le in governing the behaviour of fluctuations around the\ninstanton in the semi-classical approximation. A important result is that in an instanton (self-dual)\nbackground \u2206(+) has zero modes, whereas, by virtue of (2.29), \u2206(\u2212) is a positive semi-definite operator\nand therefore has no normalizable zero modes.\nThe zero modes are associated to the collective coordinates in the following way. Consider the\nspace of solutions An(x;X) where xn are the Euclidean spacetime coordinates and X\n\u00b5 are the collective\ncoordinates. The derivative of the gauge field with respect to a collective coordinate, \u2202An\/\u2202X\n\u00b5, is\nguaranteed to satisfy the zero mode equation (2.20): in other words it is a potential zero mode. In\norder to ensure that it is a genuine zero mode, we have to satisfy the gauge condition (2.24). The way\nto achieve this is to notice that (2.20) is trivially satisfied by a gauge transformation \u03b4An = Dn\u2126, for\nsome function \u2126 in the Lie algebra of the gauge group. We can then consider a linear combination of\nthe derivative by the collective coordinate and a compensating gauge transformation:\n\u03b4\u00b5An(x;X) \u2261 \u2202An(x;X)\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2212Dn\u2126\u00b5(x) . (2.30)\nThe parameter of the gauge transformation \u2126\u00b5(x) is chosen in order that (2.24) is satisfied by \u03b4\u00b5An;\nhence\nDn\n( \u2202An\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\n= D2\u2126\u00b5 . (2.31)\n17\nThe quantity \u03b4\u00b5An is then the \u201cgenuine\u201d zero mode associated to X\n\u00b5. For the case of instantons, as\nlong as we work in a special gauge known as singular gauge (as in Eq. (2.15)), there are no subtleties\nassociated with normalizability and \u03b4\u00b5An are all square integrable. This rather convenient choice of\ngauge will be described in \u00a7II.4.3. Subsequently in \u00a7II.5 we will show in singular gauge that \u03b4\u00b5An is\nO(x\u22123) for large x.\nWe have seen that all collective coordinates are associated to zero modes. However, when gauge fields\ncouple to other fields, it can happen that instanton zero modes are no longer associated to collective\ncoordinates because they can fail to integrate from solutions of the linearized problem to solutions of\nthe full coupled equations. Often we find that zero modes of the linearized problem are lifted by higher\norder interactions or by external interactions (for instance when scalar fields have VEVs). In these\ncircumstances it is still useful to introduce the notion of quasi-collective coordinates which are lifted by\na non-trivial effective action. The quasi-collective coordinates give rise to the notion of a quasi-instanton\nwhich only satisfies the classical equation-of-motion up to a certain order in the coupling.\nII.3 General properties of the moduli space of instantons\nThe moduli space of instanton solutions plays a central ro\u02c6le in our story so it is important to describe\nin some detail how one arrives at a description of it. The story is necessarily rather mathematical, but\nthe final answer, known as the ADHM construction, after Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin [7] is\na great mathematical achievement which we will review in \u00a7II.4. The ADHM moduli space has a lot\nof structure that can be deduced from general considerations. For example, the dimension of Mk can\nbe obtained by simply counting the number of zero modes at a point in the moduli space using the\nAtiyah-Singer Index Theorem [14] (for applications to instantons see [15]). The result is that Mk has\nreal dimension 4kN .\nII.3.1 The moduli space as a complex manifold\nWe have argued that the moduli space Mk is a space with dimension 4kN . In fact it is a Riemannian\nmanifold endowed with a natural metric defined as the functional inner product of the zero modes (in\nsingular gauge),6\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X) = \u22122g2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4\u00b5An(x;X)\u03b4\u03bdAn(x;X) . (2.32)\nThis metric plays an important ro\u02c6le in the theory since, as we establish in \u00a7III, it defines the volume\nform on Mk that arises from changing variables in the path integral from the gauge field to the collective\ncoordinates. However, we shall find that various other quantities that are derived from the metric, like\nthe connection and curvature, also have an important ro\u02c6le to play in the instanton calculus.\nIn fact there is more structure to the moduli space than simply the existence of a metric. It turns\nout that it is also a complex manifold of a very particular kind; namely a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space (with\n6The factor of g2 is inserted here so that the metric is independent of the coupling.\n18\nsingularities). A short review of some relevant aspects of such spaces is provided in Appendix B.\nFundamentally, these spaces admit 3 linearly independent complex structures I(c), c = 1, 2, 3, that\nsatisfy the algebra\nI\n(c)\nI\n(d) = \u2212\u03b4cd + \u01ebcdeI(e) . (2.33)\nOften we will represent them as a three-vector ~I. The key idea for constructing the triplet of complex\nstructures on Mk arises from noticing that Euclidean spacetime is itself hyper-Ka\u00a8hler. The three\ncomplex structures of R4 can be chosen so that Icmn = \u2212\u03b7\u00afcmn, where \u03b7\u00afcmn is a \u2019t Hooft \u03b7-symbol defined\nin Appendix A. In the quaternion basis x\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\n(~I \u00b7 x)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = ix\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9 , (~I \u00b7 x\u00af)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 = \u2212i~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9x\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1 . (2.34)\nThese descend to give the three complex structures on Mk in the following way. Notice that in the zero\nmode equation (2.26) \u03b2\u02d9 is a free index. This means that if \u03b4\u00b5A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 is a zero mode then so is \u03b4\u00b5A\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9G\n\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03b1\u02d9,\nfor any constant matrix G. In particular, if \u03b4\u00b5A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 is a zero mode then so is (~I \u00b7 \u03b4\u00b5A)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03b4\u00b5A\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9.\nSince the zero modes form a complete set, there must exist ~I\u03bd\u00b5 such that\n(~I \u00b7 \u03b4\u00b5A)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = \u03b4\u03bdA\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9~I\u03bd\u00b5 , (2.35)\nfrom which it follows that the triplet ~I\u03bd\u00b5 satisfies the algebra (2.33).\nAt this stage, ~I\n\u00b5\n\u03bd are almost complex structures because we have not proved that they are integrable\n(B.1). Rather than prove this directly we will follow the analysis of Maciocia [16] and construct a hyper-\nKa\u00a8hler potential for Mk. This proves that Mk is not only hyper-Ka\u00a8hler but also it is a rather special kind\nfor which each complex structure shares the same Ka\u00a8hler potential (called the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential).\nThe expression for the potential is [16]\n\u03c7 = \u2212g\n2\n4\n\u222b\nd4xx2 trN F\n2\nmn . (2.36)\nIn order to prove this, we pick out one of the complex structures I(c) of R4. Choose holomorphic\ncoordinates (zi, z\u00afi), i = 1, 2, with respect to this particular complex structure. For example, choosing\nI\n(3) we have z1 = ix3 + x4 and z2 = ix1 \u2212 x2. The complex structure is associated, via (2.35), with\na complex structure on Mk. We can then choose a set of matching holomorphic coordinates on Mk\n(Z i, Z\u00af i), i = 1, . . . , 1\n2\ndimMk for which the complex structure on the moduli space is\nI\n(c) =\n(\ni\u03b4ij 0\n0 \u2212i\u03b4ij\n)\n. (2.37)\nThen, (\nI\n(c) \u00b7 \u2202A\n\u2202Z i\n)\n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n= i\n\u2202A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202Z i\n,\n(\nI\n(c) \u00b7 \u2202A\n\u2202Z\u00af i\n)\n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n= \u2212i\u2202A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202Z\u00af i\n. (2.38)\nFor example, for I(3) we have\n\u2202A\u03b12\n\u2202Z i\n= 0 ,\n\u2202A\u03b11\n\u2202Z\u00af i\n= 0 . (2.39)\nFurthermore, the variation equation (2.20) implies that the derivatives above automatically satisfy the\nbackground gauge condition (2.25). Consequently\n\u03b4iAn \u2261 \u2202An\n\u2202Z i\n, \u03b4\u00afiAn \u2261 \u2202An\n\u2202Z\u00af i\n(2.40)\n19\nare zero modes directly without the need for a compensating gauge transformation (2.30). This fact\nturns out to be crucial. Furthermore,\n\u22022An\n\u2202Z\u00af j\u2202Z i\n= 0 , (2.41)\nas is clear from (2.39) for the case of I(3).\nBy explicit calculation, using the zero mode condition (2.26) and (2.41), one finds\n\u22022\n\u2202Z\u00af j\u2202Z i\ntrN F\n2\nmn = \u0003 trN \u03b4iAn\u03b4\u00afjAn \u2212 2\u2202m\u2202ntrN \u03b4iAm \u03b4\u00afjAn . (2.42)\nUsing this in (2.36) and integrating-by-parts twice, discarding the surface terms since the zero modes\ndecay as O(x\u22123), we have\n\u22022\u03c7\n\u2202Z\u00af j\u2202Z i\n= \u22122g2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4iAn \u03b4\u00afjAn . (2.43)\nBy comparing with (2.32), we see that the above expression is a component of the metric on the space\nof zero modes:\ng(X) =\n\u22022\u03c7\n\u2202Z\u00af j\u2202Z i\ndZ i dZ\u00af j . (2.44)\nThis proves that \u03c7 is the Ka\u00a8hler potential for the complex structure I(c) for c = 3. However, \u03c7manifestly\ndoes not depend on the choice of the index c = 1, 2, 3 and so it is a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential, and by\nimplication Mk is hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space.\nII.4 The ADHM construction of instantons\nIn this section, we describe the construction of instantons due to Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin\n(ADHM) [7] and how this leads to a description of Mk for which the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler property is manifest.\nThis remarkable construction of ADHM was originally discussed in Refs. [17\u201319]. Here we follow, with\nminor modifications, the SU(N) formalism of Refs. [20,21]. Our approach here is to describe the ADHM\nconstruction as an ansatz for producing instanton solutions and we direct the reader to the references\nabove for the more mathematical technicalities.\nThe basic object in the ADHM construction is the (N +2k)\u00d72k complex-valued matrix \u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9 which\nis taken to be linear in the spacetime variable xn:\n\u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9(x) = a\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9 + b\n\u03b1\n\u03bbix\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 , \u2206\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\ni (x) = a\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\ni + x\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 b\u00af\u03bbi\u03b1 . (2.45)\nHere, we have introduced \u201cADHM indices\u201d \u03bb, \u00b5 . . . = 1, . . . , N + 2k and \u201cinstanton indices\u201d i, j, . . . =\n1, . . . , k and used the quaternionic representation of xn as in (2.8) and (2.9). By definition the conjugate\nis7\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi \u2261 (\u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9)\u2217 . (2.46)\n7Throughout this, and other sections, an over-bar means Hermitian conjugation: \u2206\u00af \u2261 \u2206\u2020. Notice as usual we have to\ndistinguish between upper and lower spinor indices, and hence ADHM indices, but not for the other types of index.\n20\nWe will soon verify by direct calculation that k is the instanton charge of the solution. As discussed\nbelow, the complex-valued constant matrices a and b in (2.45) constitute a (highly over complete) set\nof collective coordinates on Mk.\nGenerically, the null-space of the Hermitian conjugate matrix \u2206\u00af(x) is N -dimensional, as it has N\nfewer rows than columns. The basis vectors for this null-space can be assembled into an (N + 2k)\u00d7N\ndimensional complex-valued matrix U\u03bbu(x), u = 1, . . . , N :\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi U\u03bbu = 0 = U\u00af\n\u03bb\nu\u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9 , (2.47)\nwhere U is orthonormalized according to\nU\u00af\u03bbuU\u03bbv = \u03b4uv . (2.48)\nThe construction requires a non-degeneracy condition: the maps \u2206\u03b1\u02d9(x) : C\nk \u2192 CN+2k must be injective\nwhile the maps \u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9(x) : CN+2k \u2192 Ck must be surjective. Having said this, we will see in \u00a7II.6, that\npoints where the non-degeneracy conditions break down have an interesting physical interpretation.\nIn turn, the classical ADHM gauge field An is constructed from U as follows. Note first that for the\nspecial case k = 0, the antisymmetric gauge configuration An defined by\n8\n(An)uv = g\n\u22121U\u00af\u03bbu\u2202nU\u03bbv (2.49)\nis \u201cpure gauge\u201d so that it automatically solves the self-duality equation (2.5) in the vacuum sector. The\nADHM ansatz is that Eq. (2.49) continues to give a solution to Eq. (2.5), even for nonzero k. As we\nshall see, this requires the additional condition\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi \u2206\u03bbj\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9(f\n\u22121)ij , (2.50)\nwhere f is an arbitrary x-dependent k \u00d7 k dimensional Hermitian matrix. Note that the existence of\nthe inverse f\u22121 is guaranteed by the non-degeneracy condition.\nTo check the validity of the ADHM ansatz, we first observe that Eq. (2.50) combined with the\nnull-space condition (2.47) imply the completeness relation\nP\u03bb\u00b5 \u2261 U\u03bbuU\u00af\u00b5u = \u03b4\u00b5\u03bb \u2212\u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9fij\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5j . (2.51)\nNote that P, as defined, is actually a projection operator; the fact that one can write P in these\ntwo equivalent ways turns out to be a useful trick in ADHM algebra, used pervasively throughout the\ninstanton calculus. With the above relations the expression for the field strength Fmn may be massaged\nas follows:\nFmn \u2261 \u2202mAn \u2212 \u2202nAm + g[Am, An] = g\u22121\u2202[m(U\u00af\u2202n]U) + g\u22121(U\u00af\u2202 [mU)(U\u00af\u2202n]U)\n= g\u22121\u2202 [mU\u00af(1\u2212 UU\u00af)\u2202n]U = g\u22121\u2202 [mU\u00af\u2206f\u2206\u00af\u2202n]U\n= g\u22121U\u00af\u2202[m\u2206f\u2202n]\u2206\u00afU = g\u22121U\u00afb\u03c3[m\u03c3\u00afn]f b\u00afU\n= 4g\u22121U\u00afb\u03c3mnf b\u00afU .\n(2.52)\n8Frequently, where confusion cannot arise, we do not indicate all the indices. Often only the spinor indices have to\nlabelled explicitly.\n21\nSelf-duality of the field strength then follows automatically from the self-duality property of the tensor\n\u03c3mn (2.12).\nThe instanton number of the ADHM configuration can be calculated directly using a remarkable\nidentity of Osborn [8] for trN F\n2 in the ADHM background proved in Appendix C:\n\u2212 g\n2\n16\u03c02\n\u222b\nd4x trN F\n2\nmn =\n1\n16\u03c02\n\u222b\nd4x\u00032trk log f . (2.53)\nNow from (2.50) one can deduce the asymptotic form for f(x) for large x, f(x)\nx\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 x\u221221[k]\u00d7[k], and\ntherefore the right-hand side is equal to k as claimed.\nLet us analyse the factorization condition (2.50) in more detail. Noting that fij(x) is arbitrary, one\nextracts three x-independent conditions on a and b:\na\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi a\u03bbj\u03b2\u02d9 = (\n1\n2\na\u00afa)ij \u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9\n, (2.54a)\na\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi b\n\u03b2\n\u03bbj = b\u00af\n\u03b2\u03bb\ni a\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03bbj , (2.54b)\nb\u00af\u03bb\u03b1ib\n\u03b2\n\u03bbj = (\n1\n2\nb\u00afb)ij \u03b4\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 . (2.54c)\nThese three conditions are generally known as the \u201cADHM constraints\u201d [18, 19].9 They define a set of\ncoupled quadratic conditions on the matrix elements of a, a\u00af b and b\u00af. Note that (2.54b) and (2.54c) can\nbe combined in the useful form\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1 = b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 . (2.55)\nThe fact that the ADHM construction involves non-linear constraints presents considerable difficulties\nfor practical applications. However, it turns out, as we shall we shall see in \u00a7VI.1, that the ADHM\nconstraints can be resolved in a simple way, at least generically, when N \u2265 2k.\nThe elements of the matrices a and b comprise the collective coordinates for the k-instanton gauge\nconfiguration. Clearly the number of independent such elements grows as k2, even after accounting for\nthe constraints (2.54a)-(2.54c). In contrast, the number of physical collective coordinates should equal\n4kN which scales linearly with k. It follows that a and b constitute a highly redundant set. Much of this\nredundancy can be eliminated by noting that the ADHM construction is unaffected by x-independent\ntransformations of the form\n\u2206\u2192 \u039b\u2206\u03a5\u22121 , U \u2192 \u039bU , f \u2192 \u03a5f\u03a5\u2020 , (2.56)\nprovided \u039b \u2208 U(N + 2k) and \u03a5 \u2208 Gl(k,C). Exploiting these symmetries, one can choose a repre-\nsentation in which b assumes a simple canonical form [18]. Decomposing the index \u03bb = u+ i\u03b1\nb\u03b2\u03bbj = b\n\u03b2\n(u+i\u03b1)j =\n(\n0\n\u03b4 \u03b2\u03b1 \u03b4ij\n)\n, b\u00af\u03bb\u03b2j = b\u00af\n(u+i\u03b1)\n\u03b2j =\n(\n0 \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4ji\n)\n. (2.57)\n9We should warn the reader that we use the term \u201cADHM constraints\u201d in a rather more restricted sense after a\ncanonical choice has been made below.\n22\nThe remaining variables all reside in a and we will split them up in a way that mirrors the canonical\nform for b:\na\u03bbj\u03b1\u02d9 = a(u+i\u03b1)j\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\nwuj\u03b1\u02d9\n(a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)ij\n)\n, a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbj = a\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9(u+i\u03b1)\nj =\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9ju (a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1)ji\n)\n, (2.58)\nWith b in the canonical form (2.57), the third ADHM constraint of (2.54c) is satisfied automatically,\nwhile the remaining constraints (2.54a) and (2.54b) boil down to the k \u00d7 k matrix equations:\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9(a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9) = 0 (2.59a)\n(a\u2032n)\n\u2020 = a\u2032n . (2.59b)\nIn (2.59a) there are three separate equations since we have contracted a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 with any of the three Pauli\nmatrices, while in Eq. (2.59b) we have decomposed a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 and a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 in our usual quaternionic basis of spin\nmatrices (2.8):\na\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = a\n\u2032\nn\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 , a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 = a\u2032n\u03c3\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\nn . (2.60)\nIn the canonical form (2.57) we also have the useful identity\nb\u00af\u03b1b\n\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b21[k]\u00d7[k] (2.61)\nand the ADHM matrix f takes the form\nf = 2\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + (a\n\u2032\nn + xn1[k]\u00d7[k])\n2\n)\u22121\n. (2.62)\nNote that the canonical form for b (2.57) is preserved by a residual U(k) subgroup of the U(N +\n2k)\u00d7Gl(k,C) symmetry group (2.56):\n\u039b =\n(\n1[N]\u00d7[N] 0\n0 \u039e 1[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\n, \u03a5 = \u039e , \u039e \u2208 U(k) . (2.63)\nThese residual transformations act non-trivially on the remaining variables:\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 w\u03b1\u02d9\u039e , a\u2032n \u2192 \u039e\u2020 a\u2032n \u039e . (2.64)\nHenceforth, we shall use exclusively the streamlined version of the ADHM construction obtained\nby fixing b as in (2.57). The basic variables will be a\u03b1\u02d9 = {w\u03b1\u02d9, a\u2032n} where we will automatically assume\n(2.59b) so that the four k \u00d7 k matrices a\u2032n are defined from the outset to be Hermitian. The remaining\nconstraints (2.59a)\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2261 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n(\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n= 0 (2.65)\nwill be called the \u201cADHM constraints\u201d.\nII.4.1 The ADHM construction as a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient\nIt follows from the ADHM construction of the solutions of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations that the\nmoduli space Mk is identified with the variables a\u03b1\u02d9 subject to the ADHM constraints (2.65) quotiented\n23\nby the residual symmetry group U(k) (2.64). Subsequently it was realized that the ADHM construction\nwas actually an example of a more general construction that has become known as the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient [22]. This construction is reviewed in Appendix B and provides a way of constructing a new\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler space M starting from a \u201cmother\u201d hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space M\u02dc with suitable isometries. In\nthe case of the ADHM construction, the mother space M\u02dc is simply the Euclidean space R4k(k+N) with\ncoordinates a\u03b1\u02d9 and metric\ng\u02dc = 4\u03c02\n(\n2dw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu dwui\u03b1\u02d9 + d(a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1)ij d(a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)ji\n) \u2261 8\u03c02trk (dw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 dw\u03b1\u02d9 + da\u2032n da\u2032n) . (2.66)\nThe normalization factor here will be justified in \u00a7II.5. Flat space with dimension a multiple of four is\ntrivially hyper-Ka\u00a8hler as described in Appendix B. The tangent space of a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space of real\ndimension 4n, admits a distinguished Sp(n)\u00d7 SU(2) basis of tangent vectors. For flat space R4k(N+k),\nthis symplectic structure is realized by a set of coordinates z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9, i\u02dc = 1, . . . , 2k(N + k) and \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2, in\nterms of which the flat metric is\ng\u02dc = \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9dz\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 dz j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 , (2.67)\nwhere \u2126\u02dc is a symplectic matrix. In the present case, where M\u02dc = R4k(N+k) is identified with a\u03b1\u02d9, the\ncoordinates and matrix \u2126\u02dc are\nz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\n(a\u00af\u2032\u03b1\u02d91)ij\n\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9wui\u03b2\u02d9\n\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9(a\u2032\n1\u03b2\u02d9\n)ij\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc = 4\u03c02\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 0 1[kN]\u00d7[kN] 0\n0 0 0 1[k2]\u00d7[k2]\n\u22121[kN]\u00d7[kN] 0 0\n0 \u22121[k2]\u00d7[k2] 0 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (2.68)\nwhere the Roman indices i\u02dc, j\u02dc, . . . each run over the set of 2k(N + k) composite indices {iu, ij, ui, ij}.\nThe ADHM construction is the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient of M\u02dc = R4k(N+k) by the isometry group U(k)\nwhich acts on the variables a\u03b1\u02d9 as in (2.64). This action defines a set of tri-holomorphic Killing vector\nfields on M\u02dc:\nXr = iT\nr\nijw\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nju\n\u2202\n\u2202w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\n\u2212 iT rjiwuj\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202\n\u2202wui\u03b1\u02d9\n+ i[T r, a\u2032n]ij\n\u2202\n\u2202(a\u2032n)ij\n, (2.69)\nwhere T r is a generator of U(k) in the fundamental representation.10\nThere are two main parts to the quotient construction. Firstly, one restricts to the level set N \u2282 M\u02dc,\ndefined by the vanishing of the moment maps associated to the isometries, in this case the U(k) vector\nfields (2.69). The expressions for the moment maps are given in (B.39), using (2.68) and (2.69), the\nmoment maps are\ni~\u00b5Xr = 4\u03c02~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9trk\n(\nT ra\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b2\u02d9\n)\u2212 ~\u03b6r . (2.70)\nThe central elements ~\u03b6r can, in this case, take values in the Lie algebra of the U(1) factor of the gauge\ngroup. One notices immediately that the ADHM constraints (2.65) are precisely the conditions ~\u00b5Xr = 0\n(with vanishing central element). In other words, the ADHM constraints explicitly implements the first\npart of the quotient construction. The second part of the quotient construction involves an ordinary\nquotient of N by the U(k) action (which is guaranteed to fix N). But this quotient, as we have seen, is\nalso an essential ingredient of the ADHM construction.\n10We will choose a normalization trkT\nrT s = \u03b4rs.\n24\nThe conclusion is that the ADHM construction realizes the instanton moduli space Mk as a hyper-\nKa\u00a8hler quotient of flat space by a U(k) group of isometries (with vanishing central elements ~\u03b6r = 0).\nLater in \u00a7XI.1, we shall describe what the physical interpretation of taking a non-vanishing ~\u03b6r. The\ndimension of the quotient space Mk is\ndimMk = dim M\u02dc\u2212 4 dimU(k) = 4kN , (2.71)\nas anticipated by the Index Theorem.\nThe importance of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction is that geometric properties of Mk are\ninherited from the mother space M\u02dc in a rather straightforward way (as described in Appendix B). For\nexample of particular importance will be the metric on Mk and we will now describe in some detail how\nto construct it. First of all, we focus on TN, the tangent space of the level set. Locally, as described in\nAppendix B, this is the subspace of TM\u02dc orthogonal to the 3k2 vectors I\u02dc\n(c)\nXr, where I\u02dc\n(c)\nare the three\nindependent complex structures of the mother space M\u02dc. Then we have the following decomposition\nTN = V\u2295H , (2.72)\nwhere the horizontal subspace H is the subspace orthogonal to the vectors Xr and the vertical subspace\nV is the orthogonal complement. The tangent space of Mk is identified with the quotient TN\/V. This\nmeans that each X \u2208 TM has a unique lift to H, which, by a slight abuse of notation, we denote by\nthe same letter. The metric on the quotient g(X, Y ) is then identified with the metric on M\u02dc, g\u02dc(X, Y ),\nevaluated on the lifts to H.\nWhat we would like to show is that the metric on Mk inherited from the quotient construction is\nequal to the metric on Mk that arises from the functional inner product of zero modes (2.32). Rather\nthan implement the procedure that we describe above explicitly, it is more straightforward to use the\nfact that the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler spaces that we are considering are of a special class which admit a hyper-\nKa\u00a8hler potential. We have already determined in (2.36) the form of this potential for the metric arising\nfrom the inner product of zero modes. Is this equal to the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential arising from the\nquotient construction? First of all, the mother space M\u02dc trivially admits such a potential with\n\u03c7\u02dc = \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9z\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 z j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 \u2261 8\u03c02trk\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + a\n\u2032\nna\n\u2032\nn\n)\n. (2.73)\nThe hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential on the quotient space Mk is then simply obtained by finding a parameter-\nization of the ADHM variables in terms of the coordinates {X\u00b5} on Mk. In other words z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(X), or\na\u03b1\u02d9(X), which solves the ADHM constraints and for some choice of gauge slice for the U(k) action on\nthe level set N. The hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential for Mk is then obtained by restriction\n\u03c7(X) = \u03c7\u02dc\n(\nz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(X)\n)\n= 8\u03c02trk\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9(X)w\u03b1\u02d9(X) + a\n\u2032\nn(X)a\n\u2032\nn(X)\n)\n. (2.74)\nWe now evaluate (2.36) using Osborn\u2019s formula (C.6) for trN F\n2\nmn, giving\n\u03c7 =\ng2\n4\n\u222b\nd4xx2\u00032trk log f . (2.75)\nApplying Gauss\u2019s Theorem along with the ADHM form for the matrix f (2.62) and (2.45), one finds\nprecisely (2.74).\n25\nII.4.2 Symmetries and the moduli space\nWe now show how the symmetries of the classical gauge theory broken by an instanton solution are\nrealized on the ADHM moduli space. Consider, first of all, the action of the conformal group on the\ninstanton solutions. The action of the conformal group is given most elegantly in the quaternion basis\n(2.19). So acting on the ADHM variable \u2206(x) we find\n\u2206(x\u2032; a, b) = \u2206(x; aD + bB, aC + bA)(Cx+D)\u22121 . (2.76)\nNotice that since the gauge field only depends on U\u00af and U , defined by (2.47), the factor of (Cx+D)\u22121\non the right is redundant. Hence, the action of the conformal group on the ADHM variables is\na\u2192 aD + bB , b\u2192 aC + bA . (2.77)\nTo get the transformation on our canonical basis (2.57) and (2.58) we have to perform a compensating\ntransformation of the form (2.56) in order to return b to its canonical form (2.57). So there exist\ntransformations of the form (2.56), with \u039b and \u03a5 dependent on a and the element of the conformal\ngroup, that takes\n\u039b(aC + bA)\u03a5\u22121 = b , (2.78)\nwhere b assumes its canonical form (2.57). The resulting action of the conformal group on the ADHM\nvariable a is then\na\u2192 \u039b(aD + bB)\u03a5\u22121 . (2.79)\nFor example, translations act on the ADHM coordinates in the following way. From\n\u2206(x+ \u01eb; a, b) = \u2206(x; a + b\u01eb, b) , (2.80)\nwe deduce\na\u2032n \u2192 a\u2032n + \u01ebn1[k]\u00d7[k] , w\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 w\u03b1\u02d9 . (2.81)\nThis allows us to identify the coordinates of the centre of the instanton with the component of a\u2032n\nproportional the identity matrix:\nXn = \u2212k\u22121trk a\u2032n . (2.82)\nNote that these centre-of-mass coordinates do not appear in the ADHM constraints (2.65) reflecting of\nthe fact that the moduli space is the product (2.16).\nGlobal gauge transformation act on the gauge indices u, v, . . ., so only on the quantities wui\u03b1\u02d9. Gener-\nically, wui\u03b1\u02d9 constitute a set of 2k complex N -vectors. Consequently if N \u2264 2k then all global gauge\ntransformation generically act non-trivially on the ADHM variables while if N > 2k then there is a\nnon-trivial subgroup that leaves the instanton fixed. This is the stability group of the instanton. In order\nto identify it, we follow Bernard\u2019s description of the one instanton moduli space [23] and embed the\nk instanton solution in an SU(2k) dimensional subgroup of the gauge group. This involves choosing a\nsuitable gauge transformation that puts the N\u00d72k matrix w, with elements wui\u03b1\u02d9, into upper-triangular\n26\nform:\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8edw11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 w12... . . . ...\nwN1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wN,2k\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 = U \u00b7\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03be11 \u03be12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03be1,2k\n0 \u03be22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03be2,2k\n. . .\n. . .\n...\n...\n. . . \u03be2k,2k\n0\n...\n0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n. (2.83)\nThe \u03beab, a, b = 1, . . . , 2k, are complex except for the diagonal elements \u03beaa which we can choose to be\nreal. Note the group elements U in the SU(N \u2212 2k) subgroup in the lower (N \u2212 2k)\u00d7 (N \u2212 2k) corner\nleave \u03be invariant. Therefore, at least generically U is valued in the coset\nU \u2208 SU(N)\nSU(N \u2212 2k) . (2.84)\nThere are 4kN independent real parameters in w on the left-hand side of (2.83), matching 4k(N \u2212 k)\nin U and 4k2 in \u03be, on the right-hand side.\nWith the parameterization (2.83), the instanton solution has the form\nAn = U\n\u2020\n(\n(Ainstn )[2k]\u00d7[2k] 0[2k]\u00d7[N\u22122k]\n0[N\u22122k]\u00d7[2k] 0[N\u22122k]\u00d7[N\u22122k]\n)\nU . (2.85)\nWhere Ainstn is the k-instanton solution lying, generically, in SU(2k) \u2282 SU(N). Generically, the stability\ngroup of the instanton solution consists of the SU(N \u2212 2k) in the denominator of (2.84) along an\nadditional U(1) transformation generated by\n\u03bb =\n(\n1[2k]\u00d7[2k] 0[2k]\u00d7[N\u22122k]\n0[N\u22122k]\u00d7[2k] \u2212 2kN\u22122k1[N\u22122k]\u00d7[N\u22122k]\n)\n. (2.86)\nThe stability group, therefore, consists of elements ei\u03bb\u03b8g, with g \u2208 SU(N \u2212 2k). Notice that this is not\nexactly SU(N\u22122k)\u00d7U(1) because elements elements ei\u03bb\u03b81 and ei\u03bb\u03b82 with \u03b81\u2212\u03b82 = \u03c0 differ by an element\nof the centre of SU(N \u2212 2k). More precisely, therefore, the stability group is S(U(N \u2212 2k)\u00d7 U(1)) \u2282\nSU(N). To summarize: the non-trivial global gauge transformations acting on a generic instanton\nsolution are\nSU(N) for N \u2264 2k , SU(N)\nS\n(\nU(N \u2212 2k)\u00d7 U(1)) for N > 2k . (2.87)\nFor N > 2k, we will loosely refer to U, taking values in (2.84), as the \u201cgauge orientation\u201d of the\ninstanton, even though the true gauge orientation involves quotienting by the additional U(1) described\nabove. Notice, the additional U(1) can be identified with the U(1) subgroup of the U(k) auxiliary group.\nII.4.3 Singular gauge, one instanton, the dilute limit and asymptotics\nLet us determine the gauge field An more explicitly. This entails solving for U , and hence An itself via\n(2.49), in terms of \u2206. It is convenient to make the decomposition:\nU\u03bbv = U(u+i\u03b1)v =\n(\nVuv\n(U \u2032\u03b1)iv\n)\n, \u2206\u03bbj\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2206(u+i\u03b1)j\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\nwuj\u03b1\u02d9\n(\u2206\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)ij\n)\n. (2.88)\n27\nThen from the completeness condition (2.51) one finds\nV = 1[N]\u00d7[N] \u2212 w\u03b1\u02d9fw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 . (2.89)\nFor any V that solves this equation, one can find another by right-multiplying it by an x-dependent\nU(N) matrix. A specific choice of V corresponds to fixing the spacetime gauge. The \u201csingular gauges\u201d\ncorrespond to taking any one of the 2N choices of matrix square roots:\nV = (1[N]\u00d7[N] \u2212 w\u03b1\u02d9fw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9)1\/2 . (2.90)\nNext, U \u2032 in (2.88) is determined in terms of V via\nU \u2032 = \u2212\u2206\u2032\u03b1\u02d9fw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9V\u00af \u22121 (2.91)\nwhich likewise follows from (2.51). Equations (2.90) and (2.91) determine U in (2.88), and hence the\ngauge field An via (2.49).\nWe now show how the well-known (2.15) of \u2019t Hooft for the one instanton solution in SU(2) (in\nsingular gauge) is reproduced by the ADHM construction. Adopting the canonical form (2.57), we set\nthe instanton number k = 1, thus dropping the instanton, i, j, indices. Eq. (2.59b) then says that a\u2032n is\na real 4-vector which from the last section we will identify as minus the centre \u2212Xn of the instanton,\nas per (2.82),\na\u2032n \u2261 \u2212Xn \u2208 R4 . (2.92)\nThe ADHM constraint (2.65) collapses to\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9uwu\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03c1\n2 \u03b4\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9\n. (2.93)\nThe parameter \u03c1 will soon be identified with the instanton scale size. The constraint (2.93) can be\nexplicitly solved by taking\nw = \u03c1U\n(\n1[2]\u00d7[2]\n0[N\u22122]\u00d7[2]\n)\n, (2.94)\nwhich is the decomposition (2.83) for one instanton and identifies U \u2208 SU(N) as the gauge orientation\nof the instanton. For one instanton, the ADHM quantity f is a scalar; from (2.62)\nf =\n1\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12 . (2.95)\nThen, from (2.90) and (2.91),\nV = 1[N]\u00d7[N] +\n1\n\u03c12\n(\u221a (x\u2212X)2\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12 \u2212 1\n)\nw\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 ,\nU \u2032 = \u2212 (x\u2212X)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\n|x\u2212X|\u221a(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12 .\n(2.96)\nUsing (2.49), one finds the expression for the gauge potential in singular gauge\nAn = g\n\u22121 2w\u03b1\u02d9(x\u2212X)m\u03c3\u00afmn\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\n(x\u2212X)2((x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12) . (2.97)\n28\nComparing with the SU(2) solution (2.15), this form of the solution manifests the fact that a single\nSU(N) instanton is described by taking the SU(2) instanton solution and embedding it in SU(2) \u2282\nSU(N). In this case the three SU(2) generators are\nT cuv = \u03c1\n\u22122wu\u03b1\u02d9\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\nv , c = 1, 2, 3. (2.98)\nThe fact that these generators satisfy the SU(2) algebra is guaranteed by the ADHM constraints (2.93).\nWith the explicit solution (2.94)\nAn = U\n(\nASU(2)n 0\n0 0\n)\nU\n\u2020 , (2.99)\nwhich manifests the fact that U is the gauge orientation of the instanton taking values in the coset\nSU(N)\/S(U(N \u2212 2)\u00d7 U(1)).\nIn general a multi-instanton configuration cannot be thought of as a combination of single instantons.\nHowever, there are asymptotic regions of Mk where the solutions can be identified as being composed\nof well-separated single instantons. Here, we consider the completely clustered limit in which the k-\ninstanton configuration looks like k well-separated single instantons. Up to the action of the auxiliary\nU(k) symmetry, the completely clustered limit is the region of moduli space where the differences\nbetween the diagonal elements of a\u2032n are much greater than the off-diagonal elements (in a sense that\nwe make precise below). We can then identify X in \u2261 \u2212(a\u2032n)ii as the centres of each of the k single\ninstantons.\nTo be more specific, it is useful to fix the U(k) symmetry by setting to zero the off-diagonal com-\nponents of a\u2032n that are generated by U(k) adjoint action on the diagonal matrix diag(\u2212X1n, . . . ,\u2212Xkn).\nThe \u201cgauge choice\u201d amounts to taking\n(a\u2032n)ij(X\ni \u2212Xj)n = 0 (2.100)\nand we will denote the a\u2032 so constrained by a\u02dc\u2032. This leaves the diagonal symmetry U(1)k which will be\nidentified with the auxiliary symmetry of each of the k single instantons. In the complete clustering\nlimit, the terms (a\u02dc\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1)ik(a\u02dc\u2032\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9)kj, k 6= i, j, can be ignored in the ADHM constraints (2.65). In this case,\nthese off-diagonal constraints are linear in (a\u02dc\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)ij, for i 6= j,\n(X\u00af i \u2212 X\u00afj)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1(a\u02dc\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n)ij + w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\niuwuj\u03b2\u02d9 \u221d \u03b4\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 (2.101)\nand can be solved, although we will not require explicit expressions for the solutions. The diagonal\ncomponents of the ADHM constraints (2.65) in this limit are then simply\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iuwui\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03c1\n2\ni \u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9\n, (2.102)\n(no sum on i) for arbitrary \u03c1i. The constraint (2.102) is then the ADHM constraint of a single instanton\nand we can therefore identify \u03c1i with the scale size of the i\nth instanton. Each instanton is associated\nwith a particular SU(2) embedding of SU(N) defined by the generators\n(T ci )uv = \u03c1\n\u22122\ni wui\u03b1\u02d9\u03c4\nc\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\niv , c = 1, 2, 3, (2.103)\nwith no sum on i. One can show that the completely clustered limit is valid when, for each i 6= j,\n(X i \u2212Xj)2 \u226b \u03c1i\u03c1jtrN(T ci T cj ) . (2.104)\n29\nIn other words, the separation between the instantons must be much greater than the product of the\nscale sizes times a trace over generators which measures the overlap of the SU(2) embeddings of each\nof the instantons.\nIt will be important for many of the applications of the instanton calculus to describe the asymptotic\nfall off of the fields from the centre of the instanton. The nature of the fall off depends on the gauge\nused which for us means singular gauge as described above. From the previous formulae of this section\nfor arbitrary instanton charge k, we find the leading large-x asymptotic behavior of several key ADHM\nquantities, in singular gauge (2.90):\n\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 b\u03b1x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 , fij \u2192 1\nx2\n\u03b4ij , U\n\u2032 \u2192 \u2212x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\nx2\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , V \u2192 1[N]\u00d7[N] (2.105)\nand in addition, for the gauge field\nAn \u2192 g\u22121xm\nx4\nw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c3\u00afmn\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9 . (2.106)\nII.5 Zero modes and the metric on Mk\nThe ADHM construction yields an explicit solution for the self-dual gauge field in terms of the (over-\ncomplete) ADHM collective coordinates a\u03b1\u02d9. We now show how one can find explicit expressions for the\nzero modes. In \u00a7II.2, we showed, in the quaternion basis, that zero modes \u03b4A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 are solutions of the\ncovariant Weyl equation \/\u00afD\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u03b4A\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9 = 0. In Appendix C (Eq. (C.11)) we verify that the following linear\nfunctions\n\u039b\u03b1(C)\ndef\n= U\u00afCf b\u00af\u03b1U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1fC\u00afU , (2.107)\nfor a constant (N + 2k)\u00d7 k matrix C\u03bbi, is a solution of the covariant Weyl equation in the background\nof the instanton,\nD\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u039b\u03b1(C) = 0 , (2.108)\nas long as C satisfies the constraints\nC\u00afi\u03bba\u03bbj\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2212a\u00afi\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbC\u03bbj (2.109a)\nC\u00afi\u03bbb\n\u03b1\n\u03bbj = b\u00af\n\u03b1\ni\u03bbC\u03bbj . (2.109b)\nThere are 2k(N +2k) real degrees-of-freedom in C subject to 4k2 constraints (2.109a)-(2.109b). Hence,\nthere are 2kN independent solutions to the Weyl equation as anticipated by the Index Theorem.\nThe question is how these solutions are related to the derivatives of the gauge field with respect to\nthe collective coordinates? If X\u00b5 is an arbitrary collective coordinate then we prove in Appendix C\n(Eq. (C.16)) that\n\u2202An\n\u2202X\u00b5\n= \u2212g\u22121Dn\n( \u2202U\u00af\n\u2202X\u00b5\nU\n)\n+ g\u22121U\u00af\n\u2202a\n\u2202X\u00b5\nf\u03c3\u00afnbU \u2212 g\u22121U\u00afb\u03c3nf \u2202a\u00af\n\u2202X\u00b5\nU . (2.110)\nIn the quaternion basis we recognize the 2nd and 3rd terms as being 2g\u22121\u039b\u03b1(C\u03b1\u02d9) with C\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\u00b5:\n\u2202A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n= \u2212g\u22121D\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n( \u2202U\u00af\n\u2202X\u00b5\nU\n)\n+ 2g\u22121\u039b\u03b1(\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\u00b5) . (2.111)\n30\nThe first term in (2.111), as its form suggests, is precisely the compensating gauge transformation (2.30)\nneeded in order to force the zero mode into background gauge:\n\u2126\u00b5 = \u2212g\u22121 \u2202U\u00af\n\u2202X\u00b5\nU . (2.112)\nHence the expression for the zero modes is given explicitly by the linear function defined in (2.107)\n\u03b4\u00b5A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = 2g\n\u22121\u039b\u03b1(\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\u00b5) \u2261 2g\u22121U\u00af\n( \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\nf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1f \u2202a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\nU . (2.113)\nThe fact that C\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 satisfies the constraints (2.109a) and (2.109b) is partially taken\ncare of by taking the X\u00b5-derivative of the ADHM constraints (2.54a)-(2.54b). From the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient perspective, described in \u00a7II.4.1 and Appendix B, the conditions that arise from taking the X\u00b5\nderivative of (2.54a) are equivalent to the requirement that \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 is orthogonal to the 3k2 vectors\nI\u02dc\n(c)\nXr: i.e. \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 lies in the tangent space TN \u2282 TM\u02dc. However, this leaves k2 additional constraints\non \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 which have not been accounted for; namely,\n\u2202a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\na\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n= 0 . (2.114)\nFrom the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient point-of-view, these extra constraints simply require that the vector\n\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 is orthogonal to the tri-holomorphic Killings vectors Xr, (2.69), which generate the U(k)\nisometries of M\u02dc. This means that it lies in the horizontal subspace H \u2282 TN. The horizontal subspace\nis identified with the tangent space TMk by a unique lifting procedure. Hence, the zero modes are\nnaturally associated to tangent vectors to Mk.\nIt is remarkable that one can calculate the explicit functional inner product of the zero modes\nin singular gauge by using a formula attributed in Ref. [8] to Corrigan [24]. The proof, reviewed in\nAppendix C (Eq. (C.20)), was first published in [25], for gauge group Sp(1), and extended to gauge\ngroup SU(N) in [21]. The identity can then be written in terms of the Weyl spinor quantities \u039b(C) as11\u222b\nd4x trN \u039b(C)\u039b(C\n\u2032) = \u2212\u03c0\n2\n2\ntrk\n[\nC\u00af(P\u221e + 1)C \u2032 \u2212 C\u00af \u2032(P\u221e + 1)C\n]\n. (2.115)\nHere\nP\u221e = lim\nx\u2192\u221e\nP = 1\u2212 bb\u00af =\n(\n1[N]\u00d7[N] 0[N]\u00d7[2k]\n0[2k]\u00d7[N] 0[2k]\u00d7[2k]\n)\n. (2.116)\nFrom this identity, and the expression (2.113), we can deduce the expression for the metric on the space\nof collective coordinates (2.32)\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X) = 2\u03c0\n2trk\n( \u2202a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n(P\u221e + 1) \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u03bd\n+\n\u2202a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u03bd\n(P\u221e + 1) \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\n. (2.117)\nSince, \u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202X\n\u00b5 are the components of a vector in H (due to the constraints (2.109a)-(2.109b)), the\nmetric arising from the functional inner product of zero modes (in singular gauge) (2.117) is identical\n11The relative minus sign in the second term compared to Eq. (2.61) in [21] is due to the fact that in that reference\nwe have written the identity for the fermion zero modes and soM and N are Grassmann collective coordinates, whereas\nhere C and C\u2032 are c-number-valued.\n31\nto the metric on Mk induced by the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction. This is completely in accord\nwith the argument in \u00a7II.4.1 involving the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential.\nNow that we have found the explicit form of the zero modes and compensating gauge transformations\nin singular gauge, one can easily verify that for large x\n\u03b4\u00b5Am \u223c O(x\u22123) , \u2202Am\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u223c O(x\u22123) , \u2126\u00b5 \u223c O(x\u22122) . (2.118)\nThese formulae follow from the explicit expressions (2.110) and (2.112) and asymptotic formulae in\n(2.105).\nII.6 Singularities and small instantons\nWe have previously remarked that the instanton moduli space Mk fails to be a smooth manifold due\nto certain singularities. In this section we will explore these interesting features in more detail. Before\nwe embark on this analysis, it is important to emphasize that these singularities are not evidence of\nany pathology in the instanton calculus. The integrals over the Mk appearing in the semi-classical\napproximation of the functional integral are perfectly well defined in the vicinity of these singularities\nand in this sense the singularities are integrable.\nBefore we talk about the singularities specifically, let us develop a picture of the geometry of Mk.\nIn fact it will be more convenient, for the most part, to consider the centered moduli space M\u0302k defined\nin (2.16). As we have shown, the ADHM construction of Mk, or M\u0302k, is an example of a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient based on the quotient group U(k) and starting from flat space. Since the quotient group has\nan abelian factor the quotient construction can, in general, involve the parameters \u03b6c of (2.70) taking\nvalues in the u(1) subalgebra of the Lie algebra of U(k). However, the ADHM construction requires\n\u03b6c = 0 and this has some interesting consequences that we now elaborate.12 Firstly, the quotient space\nadmits a dilatation generated by a homothetic Killing vector which we denote \u03ba.13 To see this, let us\nnote that the mother space M\u02dc = R4n trivially admits a dilatation generated by the homothetic Killing\nvector \u03ba\u02dc with components\n\u03ba\u02dci\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 = z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 . (2.119)\nIn addition \u03ba is hypersurface orthogonal , i.e.\n\u03ba\u02dci\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2202 i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7\u02dc , (2.120)\nfor some function \u03c7\u02dc, which we identify with the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential (2.73). When the central terms\n\u03b6c = 0 it is easy to see that \u03ba\u02dc preserves the level set N and hence is the lift to H of a (hypersurface\northogonal) homothetic Killing vector \u03ba on the quotient space. The dilatation arises as a consequence of\nthe classical conformal invariance of the gauge theory described in II.4.2. The existence of the dilatation\nimplies that the metric on the quotient Mk has the form of a cone [26]. A space of this kind is known\n12The case \u03b6c 6= 0 corresponds to the ADHM construction in the gauge theory defined on a non-commutative spacetime\nas described in \u00a7XI.1.\n13A homothetic Killing vector is a conformal Killing vector, so L\u03bag = \u03c6g, for which \u03c6 is a constant.\n32\nas a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler cone. At this point it is convenient to talk about the centered moduli space M\u0302k.\nEverything we have said above is equally applicable to M\u0302k which has hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential \u03c7\u02c6 equal\nto \u03c7 in (2.74) with the trace components of a\u2032n set to zero. The fact that M\u0302k is a cone means that\nM\u0302k \u2243 R+ \u00d7 F with a metric\nds2 =\nd\u03c7\u02c62\n4\u03c7\u02c6\n+ \u03c7\u02c6ds2F . (2.121)\nSince F is not a sphere, M\u0302k has a conical singularity at \u03c7\u02c6 = 0 of which we will have more to say below.\nThe quotient space also inherits the obvious SU(2) isometries (acting in the obvious way on the \u03b1\u02d9\nindices) from the mother. These isometries on M\u02dc are generated by three Killing vectors with components\nn\u02dc(c)\u02dci\u03b1\u02d9 = I\u02dc\n(c)\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9z\ni\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 \u2261 i\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9z i\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 . (2.122)\nAs with the dilatation above, it is precisely when the central terms \u03b6c vanish that these symmetries are\ninherited by the quotient space Mk. To see this one simply has to verify that the action preserves the\nlevel set \u00b5c = 0.14 Notice that the four vectors \u03ba and n(c) are mutually orthogonal.\nThe existence of the dilatation and SU(2) isometries together implies that the centered moduli space\nis locally a product M\u0302k = [R\n4\/Z2] \u00d7 Q for some 4kN \u2212 8 dimensional space Q.15 In fact, when M\u0302k\nis described as the cone (2.121) the space F is a tri-Sasakian manifold, which due to the structure of\nSU(2) isometries described above, has the form of a non-trivial fibration of SO(3) over Q. One can\nfurther show that Q is a quaternionic Ka\u00a8hler space (see [27, 28] for more details and other references).\nHaving established the interesting cone geometry of Mk we now turn more specifically to its singu-\nlarities. It is not hard to pin down the reason for the singularities. The ADHM construction requires\nus to quotient the level set N by the U(k) auxiliary symmetry group and this procedure will introduce\norbifold singularities at points in N where U(k) does not act freely, i.e. where some subgroup of U(k)\nleaves a\u03b1\u02d9, a solution to (2.65), fixed. Geometrically, the volume of the gauge orbit through any point\nin N is proportional to the determinant of the matrix of inner products of the U(k) tri-holomorphic\nKilling vectors {Xr}: \u2223\u2223\u2223detk2 g\u02dc(Xr, Xs)\u2223\u2223\u22231\/2 . (2.123)\nThe k2 \u00d7 k2 matrix with elements g\u02dc(Xr, Xs) plays a ubiquitous ro\u02c6le in the instanton calculus and we\nintroduce the notation\ng\u02dc(Xr, Xs) \u2261 Lrs def= 8\u03c02trk\n(\nT rLT s\n)\n, (2.124)\nwhere the generators T r of U(k) were defined previously in \u00a7II.4.1. Here, using (2.66) and (2.69), L is\nan operator on k \u00d7 k Hermitian matrices of the form\nL \u00b7 \u2126 def= 1\n2\n{w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9,\u2126}+ 12 a\u00af\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u2126\u2212 a\u00af\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u2126a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 + 12\u2126a\u00af\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 ,\n= 1\n2\n{w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9,\u2126}+ [a\u2032n, [a\u2032n,\u2126]] .\n(2.125)\nAt a point where U(k) does not act freely, the operator L develops one, or more, null eigenvectors.\nThe relevant effect can be seen already at the one instanton level. In this case, the ADHM constraints\n14It is worth pointing out that the action is not tri-holomorphic because the SU(2) rotates the complex structures.\n15The Z2 quotient (acting by inversion) arises because the centre of SU(2) lies in the U(k) quotient group.\n33\nare more explicitly (2.93). The auxiliary group U(1) acts by phase rotation, w\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 ei\u03c6w\u03b1\u02d9, but does\nnot act freely when w\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 which, from \u00a7II.4.3, is the point at which the instanton has zero scale size\n\u03c1. This is precisely in accord with our description of the centered moduli space M\u0302k above as a cone\nover the tri-Sasakian space F. For the single instanton the apex of the cone is the point \u03c1 = 0. At\nthe one-instanton level we can be more explicit. In (2.87) we have identified the action of global gauge\ntransformations on Mk. In fact at the one-instanton level all gauge orbits are equivalent to the generic\none (2.87) and therefore the whole centered moduli space M\u03021 is simply a cone over the gauge orbit:\nM\u03021 \u2243 R+ \u00d7 SU(N)\nS\n(\nU(N \u2212 2)\u00d7U(1)) , (2.126)\nwhere the variable along the cone is \u03c7\u02c6 \u221d \u03c12. Since, at the one-instanton level, there are no additional\nsingularities in M\u0302k, the corresponding F is an example of a homogeneous tri-Sasakian space [27].\nAs discussed above, the centered moduli spaces M\u0302k for instanton charge k > 1 also have the structure\nof a cone over a tri-Sasakian space. The apex of the cone in this case corresponds to the point where\nw\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 and all the non-trace parts of a\n\u2032\nn vanish. We will shortly interpret this as the point in the moduli\nspace where all the instantons have shrunk to zero size and all lie coincident in R4. This is the point of\nmaximal degeneracy where the whole of U(k) is fixed. However, there are other singularities of smaller\nco-dimension in the moduli space reflecting the fact that the tri-Sasakian space F in this case is not\nhomogeneous and has singularities of its own. These can be uncovered in the following way. In \u00a7II.4.3,\nwe have described how multi-instanton configurations in various asymptotic regions of the moduli space\ncan be identified with clusters of smaller numbers of instantons. In particular, when wui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 0 for some\nfixed i = l, the ADHM constraints imply that the elements (a\u2032n)il, (a\n\u2032\nn)li \u2192 0, for i 6= l. In the limit, the\nsubgroup U(1) \u2282 U(k) corresponding to\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 wui\u03b1\u02d9ei\u03b4il\u03c6 , (a\u2032n)ij \u2192 e(\u03b4jl\u2212\u03b4il)\u03c6(a\u2032n)ij (2.127)\ndoes not act freely. This is a limit in the moduli space, where the k-instanton configuration looks like\na smooth (k \u2212 1)-instanton configuration along with a single instanton that has shrunk to zero size.\nThe point-like instanton still has a position X ln = \u2212(a\u2032n)ll; hence, in the limit Mk \u2192 Mk\u22121 \u00d7 R4. This\nprocess can continue. There are regions where some subgroup U(1)r \u2282 U(k) does not act freely, which\ncorresponds to a (k \u2212 r)-instanton configuration along with r point-like instantons. In this limit the\nmoduli space is of the form\nMk \u2212\u2192 Mk\u2212r \u00d7 SymrR4 . (2.128)\nHere, SymrR4 is the symmetric product of r points in R4.16 Additional singularities arise when the\npoint-like instantons come together at the same spacetime point. This describes a situation where a\nnon-abelian subgroup of U(k) does not act freely. The maximally degenerate situation is when the\nwhole of U(k) is fixed. This occur at the apex of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler cone and describes a configuration\nwhere all the instantons have shrunk to zero size at the same point in R4.\nIn a certain mathematical sense, the moduli space Mk excludes the regions with point-like instan-\ntons. It then has a natural compactification by including the regions with point-like instantons at the\n16This is the product (R4)r modded out by the group of permutations on r objects arising from the subgroup of the\nWeyl group of U(k) that permutes the r labels {i} for which wui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 0.\n34\nboundary [29] (see also [6]). However, in the semi-classical approximation of the functional integral,\nthe singularities of the instanton moduli space do not lead to a divergence of the collective coordinate\nintegral and\u2014for all practical purposes\u2014we need not distinguish between Mk and its compactification.\n35\nIII The Collective Coordinate Integral\nIn this section, we describe how instantons contribute to the functional integral of the field theory in the\nsemi-classical limit. To start with in \u00a7III.1 we consider the problem of expanding around an instanton\nsolution in the functional integral. We follow the approach of Bernard [23] suitably generalized in\nan obvious way to k > 1 (see also the thorough treatment in Osborn\u2019s review [8]). In particular,\nfollowing [23], we take advantage of certain simplifications that occur in singular gauge arising from\nthe fast fall off of the gauge potential. The goal of this section is to show that the leading-order semi-\nclassical approximation involves an integral over the collective coordinates with a measure defined by\nthe inner product of the corresponding zero modes along with a ratio of determinants arising from the\nfluctuations around the instanton. In \u00a7III.2 we explain how a concrete expression for the integration\nmeasure can be obtained using the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient perspective, although this was not originally\nhow the measure was found in Refs. [30,31]. We go on in \u00a7III.3 to review the successes and failures of the\nold instanton literature regarding the fluctuation determinants in the general k instanton background.\nWe do not develop this subject any further because the ratio of fluctuations in a supersymmetric theory\nis a trivial collective coordinate independent constant factor.\nIII.1 From the functional to the collective coordinate integral\nThe semi-classical approximation is a saddle-point method and, as such, in order to find the leading\norder behaviour of the functional integral, we need to consider the fluctuations around the instanton\nsolution. To this end, we expand\nAn(x) = An(x;X) + \u03b4An(x;X) , (3.1)\nwhere An(x;X) is the instanton solution as a function of the collective coordinates and \u03b4An(x;X) are\nthe fluctuations which are chosen to satisfy the background gauge condition (2.24)17\nDn\u03b4An = 0 . (3.2)\nNotice that the fluctuations depend implicitly on the collective coordinates. The action of the theory\nto quadratic order in the fluctuations is (2.27)\nS = \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4A\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u2206(+)\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b4A\u03b2\u03b1\u02d9 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.3)\nWe must also include the gauge-fixing term involving the ghost fields\nSgf = 2\n\u222b\nd4x trN bD2c . (3.4)\nThe fluctuations can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of the operator \u2206(+) which can be\nsplit into the zero modes, already extensively investigated in \u00a7II.5, and the non-zero modes:\n\u03b4An =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n\u03be\u00b5\u03b4\u00b5An + A\u02dcn . (3.5)\n17In the following all covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the instanton solution An(x;X).\n36\nHere, the non-zero mode fluctuations A\u02dcn are functionally orthogonal to the zero modes. In the functional\nintegral we now separate out the integrals over the zero and non-zero modes:\u222b\n[dAn] = g\n\u22124kN\n\u222b {\u221a\ndet g(X)\n\u220f\n\u00b5\nd\u03be\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\n}\n[dA\u02dcn] (3.6)\nHere, g(X) is the metric on the zero modes defined in (2.32). The term in braces is the integral over\nthe zero mode subspace. The factors of g in front of the measure arise from the fact that we included\na factor of g2 in the definition of the metric (2.32).\nThe non-zero mode fluctuations A\u02dcn and the ghosts can now be integrated out, producing the usual\ndeterminant factors:\u222b\n[dA\u02dcn] [db] [dc] exp\n1\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\n\u02dc\u00afA\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u2206(+)\u03b1\n\u03b2A\u02dc\u03b2\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 4bD2c\n}\n=\ndet(\u2212D2)\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\n. (3.7)\nAs is conventional, the prime on the determinant indicates that the operator \u2206(+) has zero modes and\nthese must be excluded in the product over eigenvalues that defines the determinant. So the leading\norder expression for the functional integral in the charge-k sector is\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\ng4kN\n\u222b {\u221a\ndet g(X)\n\u220f\n\u00b5\nd\u03be\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\n} det(\u2212D2)\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\n. (3.8)\nAt this stage, (3.8) is only schematic because in order to define the determinants rigorously, we must\nregularize the theory in some way. We shall consider this problem in \u00a7III.3.\nIn the final part of this section we explain how the integrals over the expansion coefficients of the\nzero modes {\u03be\u00b5} may be traded for integrals over the collective coordinates {X\u00b5}. This change of\nvariables is facilitated by the well-known trick of inserting an expression for unity in the guise of\n1 \u2261\n\u222b \u220f\n\u00b5\ndX\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223det \u2202f\u03bd\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u220f\n\u03bd\n\u03b4(f\u03bd(X)) . (3.9)\nA judicious choice for the function f\u03bd(X) is the inner product of the fluctuation (3.1) with the zero\nmode \u03b4\u03bdAn:\nf\u03bd(X) = \u22122g2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4An \u03b4\u03bdAn =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n\u03be\u00b5g\u00b5\u03bd(X) , (3.10)\nwhere we used (3.5) and the fact that the zero and non-zero modes are functionally orthogonal, along\nwith the definition of the metric g\u00b5\u03bd(X) as the inner product of zero modes (2.32).\nNow we compute the derivative\n\u2202f\u03bd\n\u2202X\u00b5\n= \u22122g2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\u2202\u03b4An\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u03b4\u03bdAn + \u03b4An\n\u2202\u03b4\u03bdAn\n\u2202X\u00b5\n}\n. (3.11)\nSince the total field An(x) in Eq. (3.1) does not depend on the collective coordinates, we can replace\n\u03b4An by \u2212An(x;X) in the first term. Using the fact that\u222b\nd4x trN Dn\u2126\u00b5\u03b4\u03bdAn = \u2212\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u2126\u00b5Dn\u03b4\u03bdAn = 0 , (3.12)\n37\nwhere the surface term vanishes due to the asymptotic form of \u2126\u00b5 and \u03b4\u03bdAn (see \u00a7II.5), and the last\nequality follows from (2.24), we have\n\u22122g2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n\u2202An(x;X)\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u03b4\u03bdAn = g\u00b5\u03bd(X) . (3.13)\nThe insertion of unity is then\n1 \u2261\n\u222b \u220f\n\u00b5\ndX\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223det(g\u00b5\u03bd(X)\u2212 2g2 \u222b d4x trN\u03b4An\u2202\u03b4\u03bdAn\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u220f\n\u03bd\n\u03b4\n(\u2211\n\u00b5\n\u03be\u00b5g\u00b5\u03bd(X)\n)\n. (3.14)\nPlugging this into (3.8), we perform the integrals over the expansion coefficients using the \u03b4-functions.\nSince g\u00b5\u03bd(X) is invertible the \u03b4-functions enforce \u03be\n\u00b5 = 0. Consequently in the second term of the\ndeterminant we can replace \u03b4An by the non-zero mode part of the fluctuation A\u02dcn. This term is higher\norder in g and may be dropped to leading order. Finally we have to leading order in in the charge-k\nsector \u222b\n[dAn] [db] [dc] e\n\u2212S[A,b,c]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\ncharge-k\ng\u21920\u2212\u2192 e\n2\u03c0ik\u03c4\ng4kN\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 \u00b7 det(\u2212D\n2)\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\n. (3.15)\nNotice that the resulting form of the collective coordinate integral is proportional to the canonical\nvolume form on the moduli space Mk associated to the metric g\u00b5\u03bd(X):\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 \u2261\n\u222b \u221a\ndet g(X)\n\u220f\n\u00b5\ndX\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\n, (3.16)\nalong with a non-trivial function on Mk equal to the determinants of the operators governing the\nGaussian fluctuations of the gauge field and ghosts in the instanton background (3.7).\nFinally, when calculating a correlation function \u3008O1(x(1)) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7On(x(n))\u3009 in the semi-classical limit, the\nfields insertions Oi(x(i)) are replaced by their values in the instanton background and so, to leading\nsemi-classical order, become functions of the collective coordinates.\nIII.2 The volume form on the instanton moduli space\nWe have shown that the leading order semi-classical approximation of the functional integral involves an\nintegral over instanton moduli space with a measure associated to the natural metric inherited from the\ninner product of the zero modes (2.32). At leading order in the saddle-point expansion, the integrand\nincludes determinants of the fluctuations (3.15), but in the present section we focus on the volume form.\nThe most direct way to obtain a workable expression for the volume form on the instanton moduli\nspace is to use the fact that this space can be described as a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient of flat space.\nActually this is not how the volume form was originally found in Refs. [20, 30, 31]. In these references,\nthe constraints of supersymmetry, the Index Theorem and other consistency conditions (most notably\n\u201cclustering\u201d in the dilute instanton gas limit) were used to write down the unique expression for the\nvolume form for a supersymmetric gauge theory. Then, decoupling the fermions and scalars, by giving\nthem large masses, an expression for the volume form on Mk was derived. Here, we will not follow this\n38\nroute, rather we shall take as our central theme the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction (an approach\nalso adopted in [32]). Since the quotient space Mk inherits a metric from the mother space M\u02dc it also\ninherits a volume form. Recall from \u00a7II.4.1 and Appendix B, there are two parts to the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient. Firstly, one restricts to the level sets N \u2282 M\u02dc defined by the vanishing of the moment maps\n~\u00b5 = 0. Then one performs a quotient by the group G finally giving Mk = N\/G. An expression for the\nvolume form on Mk, is be obtained from that of M\u02dc by imposing the vanishing of the moment maps by\nexplicit \u03b4-functions with the appropriate Jacobian. One then divides by the volume of the orbits of the\nG-symmetry. This leads in general to the expression (B.33). An expression for the volume form on Mk\nis then obtained by \u201cgauge fixing\u201d the U(k) symmetry. However, it turns out to be more convenient\nto leave the G-symmetry \u201cun-fixed\u201d. This is because the expressions for all the fields in an instanton\nbackground are G-invariant.\nFor the ADHM construction the mother space is M\u02dc = R4k(N+k) parameterized by a\u03b1\u02d9 with metric\n(2.66) and G is U(k) acting in (2.64). The moment maps are the ADHM constraints (2.59a). The U(k)\naction defines a set of vector fields on M\u02dc, Xr, r = 1, . . . , k\n2, given in (2.69). The inner-product of these\nvector fields is given by (2.124) which defines the ADHM operator L which appears in the formula for\nthe volume form. The volume form of the ADHM moduli space in its U(k)-unfixed form is, from (B.40),\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 =\nCk\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k(N+k)a\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223 k2\u220f\nr=1\n3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n2\ntrk T\nr\n(\n\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9\n))\n. (3.17)\nIn the above, we have defined\u222b\nd4k(N+k)a \u2261\n\u222b 4\u220f\nn=1\nk2\u220f\nr=1\nd(a\u2032n)\nr\nk\u220f\ni=1\nN\u220f\nu=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\ndw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu dw\u03b1\u02d9ui , (3.18)\nwhere the integral over the k \u00d7 k matrices a\u2032n and the arguments of the ADHM constraints are defined\nwith respect to the generators of U(k) in the fundamental representation, normalized so that trk T\nrT s =\n\u03b4rs. The volume of the U(k) is the constant\nVolU(k) =\n2k\u03c0k(k+1)\/2\u220fk\u22121\ni=1 i!\n. (3.19)\nThe normalization factor Ck can be determined by taking into account the normalization of the metric\n(2.66), giving\nCk = 2\n\u2212k(k\u22121)\/2(2\u03c0)2kN . (3.20)\nOur expression for the volume form on the instanton moduli space can be compared with the one-\ninstanton expressions in the literature [2,23]. For k = 1 the ADHM are resolved as described in \u00a7II.4.3.\nIn fact the necessary change of variables from wu\u03b1\u02d9 to the scale size \u03c1 and gauge orientation U is described\nin \u00a7VI.1. In particular, the (non-supersymmetric) one-instanton measure is given by (6.29) with N = 0,\nk = 1 and with W 0 \u2261 2\u03c12 and a\u2032n = \u2212Xn. In order to compare with the literature we integrate over\nthe gauge orientation U which is conveniently normalized so that\n\u222b\ndU = 1. This leaves\u222b\nM1\n\u03c9 =\n24N+2\u03c04N\u22122\n(N \u2212 1)!(N \u2212 2)!\n\u222b\nd4X d\u03c1 \u03c14N\u22125 , (3.21)\nwhich agrees with the expression for gauge group SU(N) derived in [23].\n39\nIII.2.1 Clustering\nThe relative normalization constants Ck, for different k, can be checked by using the clustering property\nof the instanton measure. This requires in certain regions of moduli space where a k instanton config-\nuration can be interpreted as well separated k1 and k2 instanton configurations, Mk is approximately\nMk1 \u00d7Mk2, and so the volume form factorizes as\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 \u2212\u2192 k1!k2!\nk!\n\u222b\nMk1\n\u03c9 \u00d7\n\u222b\nMk2\n\u03c9 . (3.22)\nWe can determine the overall normalization of the volume form by going to the completely clustered\nlimit defined in \u00a7II.4.3. In this limit, we can describe the positions of the single instanton by the diagonal\nelements of a\u2032n, (a\n\u2032\nn)ii = \u2212X in. Part of the U(k) symmetry can be fixed by setting to zero the off-diagonal\nelements of a\u2032n that are generated by U(k) adjoint action on the diagonal matrix diag(\u2212X1n, . . . ,\u2212Xkn);\nas in \u00a7II.4.3 we will denote the remaining off-diagonal elements as a\u02dc\u2032ij. In the measure, this gauge fixing\ninvolves a Jacobian factor:18\n1\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k\n2\na\u2032 \u2212\u2192 2\nk(k\u22121)\/2\n[Vol U(1)]k\n1\nk!\n\u222b k\u220f\ni=1\nd4X i\n{ k\u220f\ni,j=1\ni6=j\nd3a\u02dc\u2032ij |X i \u2212Xj|\n}\n. (3.23)\nThe off-diagonal ADHM constraints are linear in a\u02dc\u2032ij (2.101) and the corresponding \u03b4-functions in\n(3.17) can be used to integrate out completely the 3k(k \u2212 1) variables a\u02dc\u2032n. These integrals produce a\nfactor\n\u220f\ni6=j(X\ni \u2212Xj)\u22123. To complete the analysis we note that in the complete clustering limit\ndetL =\nk\u220f\ni=1\n2\u03c12i \u00b7\n\u220f\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.24)\nwhere 2\u03c12i \u2261 Li, the L-operator of each individual instanton.\nPutting everything together one finds in the complete clustering limit, with the normalization con-\nstant given in (3.20), \u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 \u2212\u2192 1\nk!\n\u222b\nM1\n\u03c9 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7\n\u222b\nM1\n\u03c9\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nk times\n, (3.25)\nas required.\nIII.3 Fluctuation determinants in the instanton background\nDeterminants of fluctuation operators in the background of a single instanton were first evaluated by\n\u2019t Hooft in the classic paper [2]. In this section, we sketch how the determinants of the fluctuation\n18The following formula can easily be derived from the well-known Jacobian that arises from changing variables from\nthe elements of a k \u00d7 k Hermitian matrix X (defined with respect to our basis T r) to its eigenvalues X i: \u222b dX =\n(2\u03c0)k(k\u22121)\/2\/\n\u220fk\ni=1 i! \u00b7\n\u222b\ndXi\n\u220f\ni<j(X\ni \u2212Xj)2. See for example [33].\n40\noperators in a general ADHM instanton background can be found, although we omit many of the\ntechnical parts of the calculation, principally because in the supersymmetric case the determinants over\nnon-zero modes cancel between the bosonic and fermionic fields [34]. A complete review of the old\ninstanton literature pertaining to the fluctuation determinants may be found in Osborn\u2019s Review [8].\nIdeally, one would want to express the results in terms of geometric quantities on the instanton moduli\nspace. This was never achieved and the final answers are quite implicit, involving spacetime integrals.\nThe first thing we need to do is to provide properly UV-regularized definitions of the determinants.\nWe will do this by introducing Pauli-Villars regulator fields with large masses \u00b5i and alternating \u201cmetric\u201d\nei, such that\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei = \u22121 ,\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei\u00b5\n2p\ni = 0 p = 1, . . . , \u03bd \u2212 1 . (3.26)\nWe will also define\nlog \u00b5 = \u2212\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei log \u00b5i . (3.27)\nFor a consistent regularization the number of regulator fields \u03bd must exceed three. The regularized\ndeterminants are\nlog det\u2032\u2206(+) = Tr\n{\nlog(\u2206(+) + P0) +\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei log(\u2206\n(+) + \u00b52i )\n}\n, (3.28a)\nlog det\u2206(\u2212) = Tr\n{\nlog \u2206(\u2212) +\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei log(\u2206\n(\u2212) + \u00b52i )\n}\n. (3.28b)\nIn (3.28a), P0 is the projector onto the zero mode subspace of \u2206\n(+). Since the non-zero eigenvalues of\n\u2206(\u00b1) are identical; hence, we can extract a very simple expression for the ratio\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\ndet\u2206(\u2212)\n= exp\n(\n2kN\n\u03bd\u2211\ni=1\nei\u00b5\n2\ni\n)\n= \u00b5\u22124kN , (3.29)\nHere, 2kN is the number of zero modes of \u2206(+) and \u00b5 is the overall Pauli-Villars mass scale (3.27). Using\nthis relation and the fact that det\u2206(\u2212) = {det(\u2212D2)}2 we can express the fluctuation determinants in\n(3.15) in terms of the determinant of the covariant Laplacian:\ndet(\u2212D2)\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\n= \u00b54kNdet(\u2212D2)\u22121 . (3.30)\nWe have succeeded in reducing the problem to that of the fluctuation determinant of a scalar field\ntransforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. By pooling together results from the\nold instanton literature we can find an expression for this determinant. Firstly, one can construct\nthe determinant for a scalar field transforming in the fundamental representation of SU(N) following\nRefs. [8, 35, 36]. The determinant for an adjoint-valued field is then related to this by a remarkable\nformula of Jack [37].\nSo we begin with a brief sketch of how one determines the fluctuation determinant of a scalar field\ntransforming in the fundamental representation. The key idea involves considering the variation of\n41\nlog det(\u2212D2)fund. by the collective coordinates.19 The resulting formula established in [8, 35, 36] is\n\u2202\n\u2202X\u00b5\nlog det(\u2212D2)fund. = 1\n6\u03c02\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03b4\u00b5AnJn , (3.31)\nwhere Jn is the conserved current\nJn = U\u00af\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9b\n\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b2f b\u00af\u03b2U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b2f b\u00af\u03b2\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n U (3.32)\nand \u03b4\u00b5An is the zero mode associated to X\n\u00b5. By integrating this expression one can extract the ratio of\nthe determinant in the instanton background to the determinant in the vacuum. The final expression\nestablished in [35] is expressed solely in terms of the ADHM matrix f :\nlog\n[det(\u2212D2)\ndet(\u2212D20)\n]\nfund.\n=\nk\n6\nlog\u00b5+ pk +\n1\n48\u03c02\n\u222b\nd4x(I1(x) + I2(x)) , (3.33)\nwhere D0 is the covariant derivative in the vacuum (An = 0), pk is a constant which will be determined\nshortly and the integrands are\nI1(x) = trk\n(\nf\u2202nf\n\u22121f\u2202nf\u22121f\u2202mf\u22121f\u2202mf\u22121 \u2212 20f 2\n)\n+\n4k\n(1 + x2)2\n, (3.34a)\nI2(x) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndt \u01ebmnkltrk\n(\nf\u02dc\u2202tf\u02dc\n\u22121f\u02dc\u2202mf\u02dc\u22121f\u02dc\u2202nf\u02dc\u22121f\u02dc\u2202kf\u02dc\u22121f\u02dc\u2202lf\u02dc\u22121\n)\n. (3.34b)\nHere, t is an auxiliary variable and f\u02dc(x, t) is the k \u00d7 k dimensional matrix derived from f(x):\nf\u02dc\u22121(x, t) = tf\u22121(x) + (1\u2212 t)(1 + x2)1[k]\u00d7[k] . (3.35)\nIn order to fix the constant pk we can appeal to a clustering argument. In the complete clustering\nlimit the k \u00d7 k matrix f is diagonal:\nf = diag\n(\n. . . ,\n1\n(x\u2212X i)2 + \u03c12i\n, . . .\n)\n, (3.36)\nwhere \u03c1i and X\ni\nn are the scale size and position of the i\nth instanton, respectively. In this limit the\nintegrals in (3.33) can easily be evaluated. (Actually the integral of I2 vanishes.) One finds\nlog\n[det(\u2212D2)\ndet(\u2212D20)\n]\nfund.\n=\nk\u2211\ni=1\n(\n1\n6 log(\u00b5\u03c1i)\u2212 518\n)\n+ pk . (3.37)\nComparing with the one instanton expression for this determinant [2] fixes the constant to be\npk = k\n(\n\u03b1(1\n2\n) + 5\n18\n) = k\n(\u2212 2\u03b6 \u2032(\u22121)\u2212 1\n6\nlog 2 + 15\n72\n)\n. (3.38)\nHere, \u03b1(1\n2\n) is a constant defined in [2].\nThe second part of the problem involves relating the fluctuation determinant associated to the\nfundamental representation of the gauge group to that of the adjoint representation. The way this was\n19Here, the subscript reminds us that the scalar field transforms in the fundamental representation of SU(N).\n42\nachieved [37] relied on the tensor product ADHM formalism developed in [18]. The analysis provides the\nfollowing explicit relation for the fluctuation determinant of the Laplace operator for an adjoint-valued\nfield in terms of one for a fundamental-valued field:\nlog\ndet(\u2212D2)\ndet(\u2212D20)\n= 2N log\n[det(\u2212D2)\ndet(\u2212D20)\n]\nfund.\n+ log detk2L\u2212 1\n16\u03c02\n\u222b\ndx4 log detkf \u0003\n2 log detkf + qk .\n(3.39)\nHere, L is the ubiquitous ADHM operator on k \u00d7 k matrices that we defined in (2.125). As above, we\nwill determine the constant qk by a clustering argument. In the complete clustering limit, we find\nlog\ndet(\u2212D2)\ndet(\u2212D20)\n= 2N\nk\u2211\ni=1\n(\n1\n6\nlog(\u00b5\u03c1i) + \u03b1(\n1\n2\n)\n)\n+ k(log 2\u2212 5\n6\n) + qk . (3.40)\nComparing this with the one instanton expression [2], we find\nqk = k\n(\n\u03b1(1)\u2212 4\u03b1(1\n2\n)\u2212 log 2 + 5\n6\n)\n= 5\n9\nk . (3.41)\n43\nIV Instantons in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories\nIn this Chapter we consider instanton configurations in gauge theories with supersymmetry. There is an\nintimate relation between instantons and supersymmetry which can be traced to the fact that, in any\nsupersymmetric gauge theory, self-dual gauge fields are invariant under precisely half the supersymmetry\ngenerators. As we will see, this is manifest in the ADHM construction, which has a very natural\nsupersymmetric generalization. Specifically we consider the minimal theories in four dimensions with\ngauge group SU(N) and N = 1, 2 and 4 supersymmetry. Like the purely bosonic gauge theory\nconsidered in previous chapters, the N = 1 and N = 2 theories are asymptotically free and the\nrelevance of instantons in the quantum theory is not immediately obvious. However, we will begin by\nfocusing on the classical aspects of these configurations.\nBefore searching for supersymmetric instantons there is the worrisome issue of supersymmetry in\nEuclidean space to discuss. The nub of the issue is the following: Weyl spinors in D = 4 Minkowski\nspace are in a \u201creal\u201d representation of the covering group of the Lorentz group SO(3, 1).20 Consequently\nthe minimal spinor in D = 4 is a Majorana spinor, which we can think of as two Weyl spinors \u03bb and \u03bb\u00af\nsubject to the reality condition\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = (\u03bb\u03b1)\n\u2020 (\u03b1\u02d9 = \u03b1) . (4.1)\nThis ensures, for instance, that the canonical fermion kinetic term is real. On the contrary, in D = 4\nEuclidean space, Weyl spinors are in \u201cpseudo real\u201d representations of SO(4) and one cannot impose\nthe reality condition (4.1). On the contrary, SO(4) \u2243 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) so the spinor indices \u03b1 and \u03b1\u02d9\nrefer to each of the SU(2)\u2019s and they are not mixed under complex conjugation. In Euclidean space\nthere is no notion of a Majorana spinor and, apparently, no Euclidean version of the theory with a real\naction. This problem may be by-passed in theories with extended supersymmetry as the Weyl spinors\nin these theories may be combined in pairs to form Dirac spinors which do have Euclidean counterparts.\nHowever, the problem is unavoidable for theories with N = 1 supersymmetry.\nThere are several alternative approaches to this issue favoured by different workers in the field. The\nmost conservative approach as described in [38] (See Appendix A of this reference), is to abandon the\nidea of constructing a Euclidean quantum field theory with N = 1 supersymmetric as unnecessary. In\nparticular, our main interest should be calculating Green\u2019s functions in the Minkowski space theory.\nAs in standard perturbative calculations, these Green\u2019s functions are most conveniently calculated\nby analytic continuation of the corresponding Minkowski space path integral to Euclidean spacetime.\nThis is effected by the standard Wick rotation of the time coordinate x0 \u2192 \u2212ix4. The path-integral\nexponent is then \u2212SE = iSM . The resulting path-integral can then be evaluated in the saddle-point\napproximation by expanding in fluctuations around the minima of SE. This procedure yields finite and\nwell-defined answers for the original Minkowski space Green\u2019s functions. In this context, the fact that\nthe fermionic part of SE is not real is inconsequential: it does not affect the convergence of the integrals.\nSome authors argue that reality of the action is not, in any case, the appropriate condition for Euclidean\nspace theories. Rather we should impose a modified condition known as \u201creflection positivity\u201d which is\n20Our conventions for spinors are described in Appendix A. In particular in Minkowski space our conventions are those\nof Wess and Bagger.\n44\ncharacteristic of fermionic actions on a spacetime lattice.\nIn the following we will adopt the conservative viewpoint described above. However, there are other\napproaches to instantons which divorce themselves from the Minkowski space theory and seek to define\nthe supersymmetric theory directly in Euclidean space [13,39]. This follows work of several authors who\nhave shown that it is actually possible to define Euclidean versions of the theories with both extended\nsupersymmetry and real actions [40\u201344]. These theories have the potentially undesirable feature of\na non-compact R-symmetry group and a scalar field with a negative kinetic term. The philosophy\nis therefore slightly different from our viewpoint\u2014and the relation with the original Minkowski space\ntheory is now rather obscure\u2014but the resulting calculations are essentially identical to those described\nbelow.\nIn the bulk of this chapter we will discuss the N = 1, 2 and 4 theories in a unified formalism. In the\nremainder of this introductory section we will introduce some of the key points which arise, starting with\nthe N = 1 theory which contains the gauge field and a single species of Weyl fermion \u03bb\u03b1 in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the gauge group. Setting the fermion fields to zero to start with, the ADHM instanton\nconfiguration trivially solves the equations-of-motion. However, must now consider the fluctuations of\nthe fermions around this solution. These are governed by the following covariant Dirac equations,\n\/\u00afD\u03bbA = 0 , (4.2a)\n\/D\u03bb\u00afA = 0 , (4.2b)\nwhere the covariant derivatives are taken in the adjoint representation and evaluated in the instanton\nbackground of topological charge k. As already discussed in \u00a7II.3, a standard application of the Atiyah-\nSinger index theorem shows that equation (4.2a) has 2kN linearly independent (normalizable) solutions.\nThese were identified explicitly in \u00a7II.5 as \u039b\u03b1(Ci), were i = 1, . . . 2kN labels the solutions of the\nconstraints (2.109a) and (2.109b). On the contrary, (4.2b) has no non-trivial solutions in an instanton\nbackground.\nThese solutions are known as the fermion zero modes of the instanton. There are two distinct\u2014but\nultimately equivalent\u2014approaches to treating these modes. One way of incorporating these modes is\nto treat them perturbatively as fluctuations around the ordinary bosonic instanton. This expansion\nis perfectly consistent, but is hard to carry out in practice beyond the lowest orders. An alternative\napproach, and the one we will adopt here, originates in the work of Novikov et al [38]. In this approach,\nwe interpret the fermionic zero modes as corresponding to a degeneracy of classical solutions just like\nzero modes of the gauge field we met in the previous chapter. More generally, the standard semi-classical\nreasoning suggests that we should look for finite-action solutions of the full coupled equations-of-motion\nof the supersymmetric theory. We will call these configurations super-instantons. In the present case\nthey are easy to find: the gauge field takes is ADHM value, while the fermions solve equations (4.2a)\nand (4.2b). Thus the right-handed fermion \u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 is zero; this ensures that the fermions do not modify\nthe Yang-Mills equation for the gauge field. Meanwhile, the left-handed fermion \u03bb\u03b1 is general linear\nsuperposition of the normalizable zero modes:\n\u03bb\u03b1 =\n2kN\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c8i \u039b\u03b1(Ci) . (4.3)\n45\nAs \u03bb\u03b1 is a fermionic field, the 2kN coefficients \u03c8\ni are Grassmann variables. In fact (4.3) can be written\nmore compactly as \u03bb\u03b1 = \u039b\u03b1(M), where the Grassmann quantities M = \u03c8iCi themselves satisfy the\nconstraints (2.109a) and (2.109b). We will call these constraints the \u201cfermionic ADHM constraints\u201d\nsince they will turn out to be the Grassmann superpartners of the \u201cbosonic\u201d ADHM constraints (2.65).\nThe solutions to these constraints will then be parameterized asM(\u03c8i).\nThe Grassmann variables \u03c8i are the fermionic analogs of the collective coordinates which parame-\nterize the general ADHM solution and we will henceforth refer to them as Grassmann collective coordi-\nnates . While the bosonic collective coordinates X\u00b5 have the interpretation as intrinsic coordinates on\nthe moduli space Mk, their Grassmann counterparts correspond to intrinsic symplectic tangent vectors\non this manifold (see Appendix B). Like the bosonic collective coordinates they parameterize degen-\nerate minima of the action and we must integrate over them. We will work out the exact integration\nmeasure in the following but the important qualitative features follow from the basic rules of Grassmann\nintegration, \u222b\nd\u03c8i = 0 ,\n\u222b\nd\u03c8i \u03c8j = \u03b4ij . (4.4)\nWe see that to obtain a non-zero answer, each Grassmann integration in the measure must be saturated\nby a single power of the integration variable. This leads to simple selection rule for fermionic Green\u2019s\nfunctions in the k instanton background. Specifically the Green\u2019s function, \u3008\u03bb(x1)\u03bb(x2) . . . \u03bb(xl)\u3009 will\nvanish unless l = 2kN . This counting can be understood by noting that N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-\nMills theory has an anomalous abelian R-symmetry under which the left- and right-handed fermions\nhave charges \u00b11. The exact anomaly in the R-symmetry current jR\u00b5 is determined at one loop as,\n\u2202mj\nR\nm =\nNg2\n8\u03c02\ntrN Fmn\n\u2217Fmn (4.5)\nIntegrating this equation over spacetime we find that conservation of the corresponding U(1) charge is\nviolated by 2kN units in the background of topological charge k. which agrees with the selection rule\ngiven above. This agrees with the selection rule described above. The symmetry means that observables\nof definite R-charge receive corrections from a single topological sector if at all. As we will see below,\nmuch more interesting behaviour is possible in theories without an anomalous abelian R-symmetry.\nIn the previous chapter we saw that a subset of the bosonic collective coordinates can be understood\nin terms of the action of symmetries of the theory on the instanton solution. The same is true for\nthe Grassmann collective coordinates. As mentioned above, any self-dual configuration of the gauge\nfield is invariant under half the generators of the supersymmetry algebra. On the other hand, the\nother half of the generators act non-trivially on the solution generating fermion zero modes. The\nN = 1 supersymmetry algebra has four supercharges and yields two zero modes. In fact, classical\nsupersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions are invariant under a larger superconformal algebra\nwhich, in the N = 1 case, includes four additional fermionic generators, two of which act non-trivially\non the instanton. Broken symmetries thus yield a total of four fermion zero modes. The argument\nwhich guarantees the existence of these zero modes is very robust (it is essentially Goldstone\u2019s theorem)\nand holds at all orders in the full quantum theory. As above, the actual number of zero modes is 2kN\nwhich equals four in the minimal case k = 1, N = 2. Thus, the situation for fermionic zero modes\nmatches nicely with the corresponding counting of bosonic zero modes given in the previous chapter.\n46\nSpecifically, the bosonic and fermionic zero modes of a single instanton of gauge group SU(2) are all\nassociated with the action of broken symmetry generators. For higher instanton number and\/or larger\ngauge group there are additional zero modes which do not correspond to broken symmetries.\nTheories with extended supersymmetry or, more generally, N = 1 theories with additional matter\nnecessarily contain scalar fields. As usual, the scalars can acquire vacuum expectation values (VEVs)\nwhich spontaneously break the gauge symmetry. This possibility is particularly important for applica-\ntions of instanton calculus to theories with asymptotic freedom. As usual such theories are characterized\nby logarithmic running of the coupling which introduces a dynamical scale \u039b. In the absence of scalar\nVEVs, the running coupling becomes large in the IR at mass scales of order \u039b and we do not expect\nsemi-classical methods to work. However, if we introduce a scalar VEV which breaks the gauge group\nat some scale v then the effective coupling will not run below this scale. In particular, if the scale of the\nVEV is much greater than \u039b, the running coupling is frozen before it has a chance to become large and\nthe theory is weakly coupled at all length scales. In these circumstances we can expect a semi-classical\nanalysis of the path integral to be reliable.\nIntroducing scalar fields, with or without VEVs, affects the instanton calculus in several important\nways. In addition to the gauge couplings of the scalars, supersymmetric Lagrangians necessarily contain\nYukawa couplings between the scalars and fermions. As above, we are looking for a super-instanton\nwhich solves the full equations of motion of the theory. A promising starting point is the configuration\ndescribed above where the gauge-field takes its ADHM value and the fermions are a general linear\ncombination of the zero-modes. The scalars themselves satisfy a covariant Laplace equation in the\ngauge field background with a fermion bilinear source term which comes from the Yukawa coupling\nand, as we review below, this equation can be solved explicitly. The solution exhibits a new feature\nof the super-instanton: bosonic fields can have pieces which are bilinear (or of higher even power) in\nthe Grassmann collective coordinates. A potentially worrying feature is that a complex scalar field \u03c6\ntypically acquires a non-zero Grassmann bilinear part, while its complex conjugate \u03c6\u2020 does not. There\nis no inconsistency here, as we can illustrate by considering the following toy integral:\nI =\n\u222b\nd2\u03c6 e\u2212|\u03c6|\n2+\u03c6A+\u03c6\u2217B , (4.6)\nwhere A and B are quadratic expressions in Grassmann variables and we suppose A 6= B\u2217. Obviously,\none should expand in the Grassmann composites A and B, since the series terminates because there\nare only a finite number of Grassmann variables, and then do the \u03c6 integral:\nI =\nP\u2211\nm,n=0\n1\nm!n!\nAmBn\n\u222b\nd2\u03c6\u03c6m\u03c6\u2217n e\u2212|\u03c6|\n2\n= \u03c0\nP\u2211\nm=0\n1\nm!\n(AB)m = \u03c0eAB . (4.7)\nHowever, the same result can be obtained by solving the \u201cequations-of-motion\u201d of \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2217 and shifting\nthe integration variables by the solution. The solutions are\n\u03c6 = B , \u03c6\u2217 = A , (4.8)\nwhich, since by hypothesis A 6= B\u2217, violate the reality condition on \u03c6. However,\nI =\n\u222b\nd2\u03c6 e\u2212(\u03c6\u2212B)(\u03c6\n\u2217\u2212A)+AB = eAB\n\u222b\nd2\u03c6 e\u2212|\u03c6|\n2\n= \u03c0eAB (4.9)\n47\nreproducing (4.7). In this way solving the equation-of-motion in the instanton background will involve\nGrassmann composite terms which violate the reality conditions of the fields, however, as we have seen\nwith the toy integral above, it is a convenient book-keeping device.\nEven in the absence of scalar VEVs, the configuration described above is not the end of the story\nbecause it does not necessarily solve the full coupled equations-of-motion. In particular, the non-zero\nGrassmann bilinear part of the scalar field can modify the equations of motion for the fermions and even\nfor the gauge field itself, invalidating our starting ansatz for these fields. In general this modification\nwill be non-trivial unless it is forbidden by the symmetries of the theory. For theories with an abelian\nR-symmetry, such as the N = 2 theory without scalar VEVs, the new terms in the equations are zero\nand our candidate super-instanton actually solves the full equations of motion. However, in one of\nthe most important cases, that of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills, there is no such symmetry and\nthe modification is unavoidable. Even in this case the situation is not as hopeless as it might appear\nbecause the offending couplings are each suppressed by powers of g2 at weak coupling. Fortunately, for\nour stated purpose of calculating the leading semi-classical contributions to Green\u2019s functions, it suffices\nto solve the equations of motion perturbatively to some order in g2. The resulting configuration differs\nfrom being an exact solution by a power of g2 and hence we will refer to it as a quasi-instanton. The\nquestion of whether a corresponding exact solution exists is an interesting one. As we are expanding in\nGrassmann bilinears, the perturbation series must truncate at some finite order and one might imagine\nthat the final result should be an exact solution. However, at least for the N = 4 theory we will\nargue that this is not the case. In fact, we will exhibit an obstruction to solving the equations beyond\nnext-to-leading order in this case. In any case, the utility of proceeding beyond the first few orders in\nthe classical equations is unclear, because one must also take into account quantum corrections which\nmodify the equations themselves at the same order in g2.\nAn important property of the quasi-instanton can be exhibited by calculating its action. The N = 4\ntheory has four species of Weyl fermions which lie in the fundamental representation of an SU(4) R-\nsymmetry. The corresponding Grassmann collective coordinates are \u03c8iA where, as in the N = 1 theory\ndiscussed above, i = 1, . . . , 2kN and A = 1, 2, 3, 4 is the R-symmetry index. In the absence of scalar\nVEVs, the action of our quasi-instanton of topological charge k is,\nS\u02dc =\n8\u03c02k\ng2\n\u2212 ik\u03b8 + 1\n96\n\u01ebABCDRijkl(X)\u03c8\niA\u03c8jB\u03c8kC\u03c8lD . (4.10)\nHere, R(X) is the symplectic curvature of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient space Mk, which depends explicitly\nthe chosen point in the moduli space. The action depends explicitly on both the bosonic and fermionic\ncollective coordinate reflecting the fact that we are not dealing with an exact solution of the equation\nof motion.\nFrom the point of view of the semi-classical approximation, the expression (4.10) can be thought of as\nan \u201ceffective action\u201d for the quasi-zero modes, to order g0 in the coupling, which results from integrating\nout the remaining modes of non-zero frequency. As we will see in the next Chapter, the exponential\nof this action is an essential ingredient in the collective coordinate integration measure. The effective\naction for the instanton collective coordinates closely related to the idea of a world-volume effective\naction for solitons and other extended object in higher dimensions. This point of view will be developed\n48\nsubstantially in Chapter X.\nThe dependence of the action (4.10), on the Grassmann collective coordinates means that the cor-\nresponding fermionic modes are not exact zero modes. These modes are lifted at order g0 in the\nsemi-classical expansion. The zero modes which are generated by the action of fermionic symmetry\ngenerators on the instanton are an important exception. The same symmetries lead to zero eigenval-\nues of the curvature tensor which mean that the action (4.10) is independent of the corresponding\nGrassmann collective coordinates. The associated zero modes remain unlifted to all orders in g2. The\nlifting of fermion zero modes means that the selection rules determining which Green\u2019s functions can\nreceive instanton corrections are much less restrictive than those of the N = 1 theory described above.\nTypically this is also related to the absence of an anomalous abelian R-symmetry. For example, in the\nN = 4 theory with zero scalar VEVs, the total number of exact fermion zero modes is sixteen (two\nsupersymmetric and two superconformal modes for each of the four species of Weyl fermion). This\nnumber does not depend on the topological charge and, for example, sixteen-fermion correlators receive\nan infinite series of corrections from all numbers of instantons.\nFinally we turn to the case where scalar fields develop non-zero VEVs. In this case, it is well known\nthat there is no non-trivial instanton solution of the coupled equations of motion for the gauge field and\nscalar. Indeed, the existence of such a solution is forbidden by Derrick\u2019s theorem. The problem is best\nillustrated by proceeding na\u00a8\u0131vely in the SU(2) theory. If we solve the covariant Laplace equation for an\nadjoint scalar \u03c6 with VEV diag(\u03c60,\u2212\u03c60) in the background of a single SU(2) instanton of scale-size \u03c1\nand substitute the solution back into the action the result is,\nS =\n8\u03c02\ng2\n\u2212 i\u03b8 + 4\u03c02\u03c12(\u03c60)2 . (4.11)\nThe instanton action depends explicitly on the scale size and may be lowered continuously to zero by\nshrinking the instanton. However, it is useful to note that the second term in the action (4.11) is down\nby a power of g2 relative to the first.21 Thus our candidate configuration is actually a quasi-instanton in\nthe same sense as in our discussion of the N = 4 theory above. In either case, our aim is to determine\nthe leading semi-classical behaviour of Green\u2019s functions and it is legitimate to solve the saddle-point\nconditions order by order in g2.\nIn the case of non-zero scalar VEVs, this approach was first developed by Affleck who referred to the\ncorresponding field configurations as constrained instantons. The formalism of constrained instantons\nis rather technical. However, as we explain below, a large part of it can actually be understood in\nterms of a modified instanton action like that given in (4.11). As mentioned above, any quasi-instanton\nwill have an action which depends explicitly on the collective coordinates. In the case of the N = 4\ntheory without scalar VEVs, the resulting expression, given as (4.10) above, is determined in terms of\nthe symplectic curvature on Mk. One of our main results is that the effect of introducing scalar VEVs\nis simply to introduce an appropriate potential on the moduli space. Furthermore this potential has a\nnice interpretation as the norm squared of a tri-holomorphic Killing vector on Mk (for related results\n21Strictly speaking this is true as long as we treat \u03c1\u03c60 as order g0. As we must integrate overall values of \u03c1 this\nassumption needs to be justified. In the cases of interest is not hard to show that that larger values of \u03c1\u03c60 are exponentially\nsuppressed and the na\u00a8\u0131ve scaling is correct.\n49\nin the context of dyons see [45, 46]).\nThe remainder of this Chapter is organized as follows. In \u00a7IV.1, we present the Minkowski space\naction, equations-of-motion and supersymmetric transformations of the minimal gauge theories with\nN = 1, 2 and 4 supersymmetries in four dimensions. We discuss the analytic continuation of the theory\nto Euclidean spacetime. In \u00a7IV.2 we construct the super-instanton at the first non-trivial order in g2.\nThis necessitates solving the adjoint Dirac equation (4.2b) for the left-handed fermion in the general\nADHM background. The general solution involves a matrix of Grassmann variables constrained by a\nlinear equation which generalizes the ADHM constraint equations of the previous chapter. We introduce\nintrinsic Grassmann collective coordinates and identify them as symplectic tangent vectors on Mk. We\ndiscuss the action of supersymmetry on the collective coordinates.\nIn \u00a7IV.3, we consider the construction of the super-instanton beyond linear order. This requires\nsolving the covariant Laplace equation for the adjoint scalar in the general ADHM background with\nan appropriate fermion bilinear source term. We show that this yields an exact super-instanton for the\nN = 2 theory (without scalar VEVs), but only a quasi-instanton, in the sense described above, in the\nN = 4 case. We demonstrate an obstruction to the existence of an exact solution in this case. In \u00a7IV.4,\nwe review the necessary aspects of the constrained instanton formalism. Finally, in \u00a7IV.5 we explain\nhow the supersymmetry of the field theory descends to the collective coordinates.\nIn the next chapter, we derive the instanton measure in supersymmetric theories. We introduce the\ninstanton effective action for these theories and discuss the consequent lifting of fermion zero modes.\nThen we derive an explicit formulae for the appropriate supersymmetric volume form on Mk.\nIV.1 Action, supersymmetry and equations-of-motion\nWe start by defining theories in four-dimensional Minkowski space with N = 1, 2 and 4 supersymmetry.\nIn the interests of brevity we will develop a unified notion that allows us to deal with all these cases\ntogether. To this end, we introduce the fermionic partners of the gauge field \u03bbA and \u03bb\u00afA. Here, A =\n1, . . . ,N is an R-symmetry index of the supersymmetry. Since we are working\u2014at least initially\u2014in\nMinkowski space, these spinors are subject to the reality conditions\n(\u03bbA\u03b1 )\n\u2020 = \u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A , (\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A)\n\u2020 = \u03bb\u03b1A (\u03b1 = \u03b1\u02d9) . (4.12)\nIn addition, for the theories with extended supersymmetry there are real scalar fields \u03c6a, a = 1, . . . , 2(N\u2212\n1). The Minkowski space action is22\nSMink =\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\n1\n2\nF 2mn +\ni\u03b8g2\n16\u03c02\nFmn\n\u2217Fmn + 2iDn\u03bb\u00afA\u03c3\u00afn\u03bbA \u2212Dn\u03c6aDn\u03c6a\n+ g\u03bb\u00afA\u03a3\nAB\na [\u03c6a, \u03bb\u00afB] + g\u03bb\nA\u03a3\u00afaAB[\u03c6a, \u03bb\nB] + 1\n2\ng2[\u03c6a, \u03c6b]\n2\n}\n.\n(4.13)\n22We remind the reader that our gauge field is anti-Hermitian rather than Hermitian, otherwise our conventions in\nMinkowski space are those of Wess and Bagger [47].\n50\nThe terms involving the scalar fields are, of course, absent in the N = 1 theory. The \u03a3-matrices are\nassociated to the SU(2) and SU(4) R-symmetry group of the N = 2 and N = 4 theories, respectively.\nFor N = 2 we take\n\u03a3ABa = \u01eb\nAB(i, 1) , \u03a3\u00afaAB = \u01ebAB(\u2212i, 1) , (4.14)\nIn this case the indices A,B, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = 1, 2 are spinor indices of the SU(2) subgroup of the U(1) \u00d7 SU(2)\nR-symmetry group. SO in this case, we can raise and lower the indices using the \u01eb-tensor in the usual\nway following the conventions of [47]. For the N = 4 case\n\u03a3a =\n(\n\u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3, \u03b72, i\u03b7\u00af2, \u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1\n)\n,\n\u03a3\u00afa =\n(\u2212 \u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3,\u2212\u03b72, i\u03b7\u00af2,\u2212\u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1) , (4.15)\nwhere \u03b7c, \u03b7\u00afc, c = 1, 2, 3, are \u2019t Hooft\u2019s \u03b7-symbols defined in Appendix A.\nThe theory (4.13) is invariant under the on-shell supersymmetry transformations\n\u03b4An = \u2212\u03beA\u03c3n\u03bb\u00afA \u2212 \u03be\u00afA\u03c3\u00afn\u03bbA , (4.16a)\n\u03b4\u03bbA = \u2212i\u03c3mn\u03beAFmn \u2212 ig\u03a3abAB\u03beB[\u03c6a, \u03c6b] + \u03a3ABa \u03c3n\u03be\u00afBDn\u03c6a , (4.16b)\n\u03b4\u03bb\u00afA = \u2212i\u03c3\u00afmn\u03be\u00afAFmn \u2212 ig\u03a3\u00afabAB \u03be\u00afB[\u03c6a, \u03c6b] + \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03c3\u00afn\u03beBDn\u03c6a , (4.16c)\n\u03b4\u03c6a = i\u03be\nA\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bb\nB + i\u03be\u00afA\u03a3\nAB\na \u03bb\u00afB .

(4.18)\nIn order to construct instanton solutions, we now Wick rotate to Euclidean space. Vector quantities\nin Minkowski space an = (a0,~a), with n = 0, 1, 2, 3, become an = (~a, ia\n0), with n = 1, 2, 3, 4, in\nEuclidean space. The Euclidean action is then \u2212i times the Minkowski space action. The exception to\nthis is that we define the Euclidean \u03c3-matrices as in (2.8) and (2.9), So in Minkowski space \u03c3n = (\u22121, ~\u03c4)\nand \u03c3\u00afn = (\u22121,\u2212~\u03c4 ), whereas in Euclidean space \u03c3n = (i~\u03c4 , 1) and \u03c3\u00afn = (\u2212i~\u03c4 , 1). Operationally, this\nmeans that when Wick rotating from Minkowski space to Euclidean space we should actually replace\nthe Minkowski space \u03c3-matrices by \u2212i times the Euclidean space \u03c3-matrices. As usual we treat \u03bb\u03b1\nand \u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 as independent spinors, i.e. independent integration variables in the functional integral.

For the case with N = 2 supersymmetry, we can recover the more conventional presentation\nof the theory by defining a complex scalar field\n\u03c6 = \u03c61 \u2212 i\u03c62 , \u03c6\u2020 = \u03c61 + i\u03c62 .

(4.23d)\nIV.2 The super-instanton at linear order\nWe will now attempt to find super-instanton configurations which solve the full coupled equations-of-\nmotion (4.22a)-(4.22d). First notice that the original instanton solution of the pure gauge theory (2.49)\nis a solution of the full equations-of-motion when all other fields are set to zero. In fact, we can use\nAm(x;X) as a starting point to find the more general solutions where the fermion and scalar fields are\nnon-vanishing. As explained in the introduction to this chapter we will proceed perturbatively order\nby order in the coupling. In this connection note the explicit powers of g appearing on the right-hand\nside of Eqs. (4.22a)-(4.22d).\nThe first step, following [38], is to expand to linear order in the fields around the bosonic instanton\nsolution. To the next order, we must therefore solve the covariant Weyl equations\n\/\u00afD\u03bbA = 0 , (4.24a)\n\/D\u03bb\u00afA = 0 , (4.24b)\n52\nfor the fermions, and the covariant Laplace equation\nD2\u03c6a = 0 , (4.25)\nfor the scalars. It then remains to be seen whether the original instanton solution needs to be modified\ndue the source term on the right-hand side of (4.22a).\nA key result follows from the fact that \/D has no zero modes in an instanton (rather than anti-\ninstanton) background. Consequently, the solution to (4.24b) is \u03bb\u00afA = 0. To prove this, (4.24b) implies\n\/\u00afD \/D\u03bb\u00afA = 0. But we can expand the product of operators using the definition of \u2206(\u2212) in (2.28b), so\n\/\u00afD \/D\u03bb\u00afA \u2261 \u2212\u2206(\u2212)\u03bb\u00afA = D2\u03bb\u00afA + \u03c3\u00afmnFmn\u03bb\u00afA (4.26)\nand use the fact that in an instanton background Fmn is self-dual. Since \u03c3\u00afmn is a projector onto the\nanti-self-dual part (2.12), we have\n\/\u00afD \/D\u03bb\u00afA = D2\u03bb\u00afA = 0 . (4.27)\nBut D2 \u2261 DnDn is a positive operator. This means D2\u03bb\u00afA = 0 implies \u03bb\u00afA = 0 and consequently there\nare no zero modes for the anti-chiral fermions. The discussion above also implies, for vanishing VEVs\nat least, that the scalar fields vanish also vanish at linear order.\nOn the contrary, for \u03bbA a similar maneuver to (4.26) gives\n\/D \/\u00afD\u03bbA \u2261 \u2212\u2206(+)\u03bbA = D2\u03bbA + Fmn\u03c3mn\u03bbA = 0 . (4.28)\nIn this case the second term does not vanish and so there is no reason for \u03bbA to vanish. In fact,\nwe should have anticipated this since, as discussed in \u00a7II.5, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem dictates\nthat the operator \/\u00afD has 2kN normalizable zero modes in the k instanton background for gauge group\nSU(N).\nIV.2.1 Adjoint fermion zero modes\nIn this section, we consider in more detail the adjoint-valued fermion zero modes in the background of\nthe bosonic instanton solution; in other words, the solutions of the covariant Weyl equation (4.24a) in\nthe ADHM background. Due to the linearity of the equation we can consider a single Weyl fermion \u03bb\nwith \/\u00afD\u03bb = 0. Fortunately, no addition work need be done since we have already solved this equation\nin \u00a7II.5 in the context of the gauge field zero modes. We can immediately write down the solutions in\nterms of the linear functions defined in (2.107):\n\u03bb\u03b1 = g\n\u22121\/2\u039b\u03b1(M) \u2261 g\u22121\/2\n(\nU\u00afMf b\u00af\u03b1U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1fM\u00afU\n)\n. (4.29)\n(The unconventional power of g\u22121\/2 in the definition reflects the true g-scaling of the fermion zero\nmodes, as will emerge in due course.) One difference from the gauge zero modes follows from the fact\nthat \u03bb is a Grassmann quantity; hence, M\u03bbi and M\u00af\u03bbi are constant (N + 2k) \u00d7 k and k \u00d7 (N + 2k)\nmatrices of Grassmann collective coordinates, respectively, which replace the c-number quantities C\u03b1\u02d9\n53\nand C\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 in (2.107). In addition, as indicated, the Grassmann collective coordinates do not carry the\nWeyl spinor index \u03b1\u02d9.\nIn order for (4.29) to be a solution of (4.24a), the Grassmann collective coordinates must satisfy the\nconstraints [18] (C.14)\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M+ M\u00af\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (4.30)\nExpanding \u2206\u00af and \u2206 as in (2.45) and writing all the indices explicitly, this becomes\nM\u00af\u03bbi a\u03bbj\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2212a\u00af\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9M\u03bbj , (4.31a)\nM\u00af\u03bbi b\u03b1\u03bbj = b\u00af\u03b1\u03bbi M\u03bbj . (4.31b)\nIn a formal sense discussed in Ref. [20], these fermionic constraints are the \u201cspin-1\n2\n\u201d superpartners of\nthe original \u201cspin-1\u201d ADHM constraints (2.54a) and (2.54b), respectively. Note further that (4.31b) is\neasily solved when b is in the canonical form (2.57). With the ADHM index decomposition \u03bb = u+ i\u03b1,\nwe set\nM\u03bbj \u2261M(u+i\u03b1)j =\n(\n\u00b5uj\n(M\u2032\u03b1)ij\n)\n, M\u00af\u03bbj \u2261 M\u00afj(u+i\u03b1) =\n(\n\u00b5\u00afju (M\u00af\u2032\u03b1)ji\n)\n. (4.32)\nEq. (4.31b) then collapses to\nM\u00af\u2032\u03b1 =M\u2032\u03b1 (4.33)\nwhich allows us to eliminate M\u00af\u2032 in favor ofM\u2032. In terms of the variables \u00b5, \u00b5\u00af andM\u2032\u03b1, the \u201cfermionic\nADHM constraints\u201d (4.31a) are\nM\u00afa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M\u2261 \u00b5\u00afw\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5+ [M\u2032\u03b1, a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9] = 0 . (4.34)\nThe quantities M = {\u00b5, \u00b5\u00af,M\u2032\u03b1}, subject to (4.34), are the Grassmann-valued partners of the ADHM\nvariables a\u03b1\u02d9 = {w\u03b1\u02d9, a\u2032n}. Later in \u00a7IV.5 we shall see that they are, indeed, related by supersymmetry.\nWe can now count the number of independent fermion zero modes. There are 2k(N + k) indepen-\ndent Grassmann variables M = {\u00b5, \u00b5\u00af,M\u2032}, subject to 2k2 constraints (4.34). Hence, there are 2kN\nindependent zero modes, in agreement with the Index Theorem.\nIV.2.2 Grassmann collective coordinates and the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction\nIt is interesting to establish the relationship between these Grassmann collective coordinates and the\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction. A hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space of dimension 4n admits a preferred SU(2)\u00d7\nSp(n) basis of tangent vectors. In particular, this leads to the notion of a symplectic tangent vector\n(B.30). With the relation between the ADHM data a\u03b1\u02d9 and the symplectic variables z\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 in (2.68), we\ncan see that the fermionic ADHM constraints (4.34) are precisely the condition that the symplectic\ntangent vector to the mother space\nMi\u02dc =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u00b5\u00afiu\n(M\u20321)ij\n\u00b5ui\n(M\u20321)ij\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (4.35)\n54\nis a symplectic tangent vector to the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient space Mk. Here, i\u02dc is the an index that, as\nearlier in \u00a7II.4.1, runs over {iu, ij, ui, ij}. In order to prove this we must show that the inner-product\nMi\u02dc\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r = \u22124i\u03c02trk T r\n(\n\u00b5\u00afw\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5+ [a\u00af\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1,M\u2032\u03b1]\n)\n, (4.36)\nvanishes, where Xr are the vectors, defined in (2.69), that generate the U(k) action on M\u02dc. It is easy to\nsee that this condition is equivalent to the fermionic ADHM constraints (4.34). To summarize, we have\nshown that the Grassmann collective coordinates are Grassmann-valued symplectic tangent vectors to\nthe instanton moduli space Mk.\nThe functional inner product of the fermion zero modes can be calculated using the same integral\nformula that we used to establish the functional inner-product of the gauge zero modes in \u00a7II.5 and\nAppendix C (Eq. (C.20)). For two such zero modes\u222b\nd4x trN \u039b(M)\u039b(N ) = \u2212\u03c0\n2\n2\ntrk\n[M\u00af(P\u221e + 1)N + N\u00af (P\u221e + 1)M] . (4.37)\nNotice that the extra minus sign in (4.37) relative to (2.115) arises because of the Grassmann-valued\nnature of the collective coordinates. This is precisely the inner product of symplectic tangent vectors\non M\u02dc:\n\u2126\u02dc(M,N ) = \u22124\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u039b(M)\u039b(N ) . (4.38)\nJust as in the c-number sector, where we have {X\u00b5} as intrinsic coordinates on Mk, so we can\ndefine intrinsic Grassmann-valued symplectic tangent vectors on Mk. To do this we solve the fermionic\nADHM constraintsM =M(\u03c8,X). Since the fermionic ADHM constraints are linear in the Grassmann\nvariables, the parameterization M(\u03c8,X) will be linear in the intrinsic Grassmann coordinates \u03c8i,\ni = 1, . . . , 2kN . In much the same way that the metric on Mk is induced by that on M\u02dc, so the inner\nproduct of Grassmann-valued symplectic tangent vectors on M\u02dc, (4.38), then induces a similar inner\nproduct on Mk. So for a pair of symplectic tangent vectors \u03c8 and \u03b8:\n\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\ni\u03b8j = \u2126\u02dc(M(\u03c8,X),M(\u03b8,X)) . (4.39)\nHere, \u2126ij(X) is the symplectic matrix which appears in the expression for the metric on Mk in (B.9).\nIV.2.3 Supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes\nIn \u00a7II.4.2, we described how those global symmetries of the classical equations-of-motion which act non-\ntrivially on the instanton are represented on the moduli space. The symmetries described there\u2014global\ngauge and conformal\u2014will also have an action on the Grassmann collective coordinates. In addition,\nwe have supersymmetry, enhanced to the superconformal group, that acts as symmetries of the classical\nequations-of-motion. These will act on the supersymmetrized moduli space [20, 38, 48].\nA special set of the fermion zero modes can be identified with the action of supersymmetry trans-\nformations on the bosonic instanton solution. As is evident from (4.23b) and (4.23c), supersymmetry\n55\ntransformations on the purely bosonic instanton turn on the fermionic fields:\n\u03bbA = i\u03c3mn\u03be\nAFmn , (4.40a)\n\u03bb\u00afA = i\u03c3\u00afmn\u03be\u00afAFmn . (4.40b)\nActually, to be more precise, in the bosonic instanton background \u03c3\u00afmnFmn = 0, so the anti-chiral\nfermions are not turned on. In particular, this means that the bosonic instanton is invariant under\nhalf the supersymmetries, namely the anti-chiral ones \u03be\u00afA. Correspondingly the chiral supersymmetry\ntransformations generate fermion zero modes. Using the expression for the field strength and fermion\nzero modes in the ADHM instanton background, Eqs. (2.52) and (4.29), respectively, we find\n\u03bbA\u03b1 = 4ig\n\u22121\/2(\u03c3mn\u03beA)\u03b1U\u00afb\u03c3mnb\u00affU\n= \u22124ig\u22121U\u00af\n(\nb\u03beAf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1f\u03beAb\u00af\n)\nU\n\u2261 g\u22121\/2\u039b\u03b1(\u22124ib\u03beA) .\n(4.41)\nHere, we have re-scaled\n\u03beA \u2192 g1\/2\u03beA (4.42)\nso that the following equations do not have g dependence. Consequently, the chiral supersymmetry\ntransformations generate fermionic zero modes with the Grassmann collective coordinates\nMA\u03bbi = \u22124i\u03beA\u03b1 b\u03b1\u03bbi , M\u00af\u03bbAi = \u22124i\u03be\u03b1Ab\u00af\u03bb\u03b1i . (4.43)\nThese privileged fermion zero modes are known as the \u201csupersymmetric zero modes\u201d. There are obvi-\nously two such modes for each species of fermion, hence the total number of supersymmetric modes is\nequal to half the number of component supercharges of the gauge theory, i.e. 2N .\nIn addition to these supersymmetric zero modes, there are fermionic zero modes corresponding to\nbroken superconformal invariance. These transformations can be obtained by generalizing the super-\nsymmetry transformations (4.23a)-(4.23d) by making the parameters \u03beA local in a particular way:\n\u03beA\u03b1 (x) = \u03be\nA\n\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A , \u03be\u00af\u03b1A(x) = \u03be\u00af\u03b1A + \u03b7\u03b1\u02d9Ax\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1 . (4.44)\nThis defines a basis of both supersymmetric and superconformal transformations generated by {\u03beA, \u03be\u00afA}\nand {\u03b7A, \u03b7\u00afA}, respectively. The bosonic instanton breaks half the superconformal transformations,\nnamely those generated by \u03b7\u00afA. These transformations generate fermion zero modes in much the same\nway as (4.41):\n\u03bbA\u03b1 = \u22124ig\u22121\/2(\u03c3mnx\u03b7\u00afA)\u03b1U\u00afb\u03c3mnb\u00affU\n= 4ig\u22121\/2U\u00af\n(\nbx\u03b7\u00afAf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1f \u03b7\u00afAx\u00afb\u00af\n)\nU\n= \u22124ig\u22121\/2U\u00af\n(\na\u03b7\u00afAf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1f \u03b7\u00afAa\u00af\n)\nU\n\u2261 g\u22121\/2\u039b\u03b1(\u22124ai\u03b7\u00afA) .\n(4.45)\nwhere in the second to last equality, we used the ADHM relations (2.47) which imply U\u00afbx = \u2212U\u00afa and\nx\u00afb\u00afU = \u2212a\u00afU . Consequently, the associated Grassmann collective coordinates are\nM\u03bbi = \u22124ia\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , M\u00af\u03bbi = \u22124i\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi . (4.46)\nAs for the supersymmetric modes, there are two such modes for each species of fermion, hence the total\nnumber of \u201csuperconformal modes\u201d is equal again to 2N .\n56\nIV.3 Going beyond linear order: the quasi-instanton\nIn order to evaluate correlation functions at their first non-vanishing order in the semi-classical ex-\npansion, we will find it necessary to go beyond the linear order analysis of the previous subsection.\nThe systematics of the semi-classical expansion can be deduced from the equations-of-motion (4.22a)-\n(4.22d) and the fact that the fermion zero modes \u03bbA are order O(g\u22121\/2) and the gauge field is O(g\u22121).\nSchematically, the various fields have the following g-expansions:\nAm = g\n\u22121A(0)m + gA\n(1)\nm + g\n3A(2)m + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03bbA = g\u22121\/2\u03bb(0)A + g3\/2\u03bb(1)A + g7\/2\u03bb(2)A + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03bb\u00afA = g\n1\/2\u03bb\u00af(0)A + g\n5\/2\u03bb\u00af(1)A + g\n9\/2\u03bb\u00af(2)A + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03c6a = g\n0\u03c6(0)a + g\n2\u03c6(1)a + g\n4\u03c6(2)a + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(4.47)\nIn the above,\nA(0)m = U\u00af\u2202mU , \u03bb\n(0)A = \u039b(MA) . (4.48)\nNote in the N = 1 theory there are no scalar fields, hence the leading order instanton solution,\nAm = g\n\u22121A(0)m , \u03bb\nA = g\u22121\/2\u03bb(0)A , \u03bb\u00afA = 0 , (4.49)\nis exact. We will also see shortly that in the absence of scalar VEVs the leading-order instanton\nconfiguration of the N = 2 theory,\nAm = g\n\u22121A(0)m , \u03bb\nA = g\u22121\/2\u03bb(0)A , \u03bb\u00afA = 0 , \u03c6a = g0\u03c6(0)a , (4.50)\nis again an exact solution. This will no longer be the case when VEVs are turned on. The N = 4 case\nis more subtle, and we will treat it carefully.\nWhen the expansions are substituting into the action, the latter is\nS =\n8\u03c02k\ng2\n+ ik\u03b8 + S\u02dc g0 +O(g2) , (4.51)\nwhere we have defined\nS\u02dc =\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\nDn\u03c6(0)a Dn\u03c6(0)a \u2212 \u03bb(0)A\u03a3\u00afaAB [\u03c6(0)a , \u03bb(0)B]\n}\n, (4.52)\nwhich will play an important ro\u02c6le in what follows. So if we wish to work to leading order in g, we only\nneed to solve the equations-of-motion to order g0.23 From (4.51), it follows we need the expression for\nthe scalar field to order g0. This is given by the solution of equation-of-motion (4.22d) with only the\nsource bi-linear in the fermion zero modes included:\nD2\u03c6a = g\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bbA\u03bbB . (4.53)\n23The higher order effects are, in any case, mixed non-trivially with the quantum effects from the fluctuations as we\nshall see in \u00a7V. The fluctuations actually also contribute determinant factors at O(g0). However, since our theory is\nsupersymmetric this is just a constant.\n57\nSince \u03bbA is O(g\u22121\/2) the solution is O(g0). The solution to (4.53) is found in Appendix C (Eq. (C.25))\nwith arbitrary VEV. Setting the VEV to zero, the solution has the form [21,25]\n\u03c6a = \u221214 \u03a3\u00afaABU\u00afMAfM\u00afBU + U\u00af\n(\n0[N]\u00d7[N] 0[N]\u00d7[2k]\n0[2k]\u00d7[N] \u03d5a1[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\nU , (4.54)\nwhere the k \u00d7 k matrices \u03d5a are\n\u03d5a =\n1\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaABL\n\u22121(M\u00afAMB) . (4.55)\nFor the case of N = 2, one can see that (4.54) implies that the holomorphic field \u03c6 is non-trivial, while\n\u03c6\u2020 remains zero. In other words, we can see that the lack of a reality condition on the fermions means\nthat the scalar field in the instanton background also violates its reality condition. The same is true in\nthe N = 4 theory. However, this violation of the reality condition only occurs in terms are quadratic\nin the Grassmann collective coordinates and so will not affect the convergence of the integrals over\nthe fluctuations of the scalar field (which will still satisfy the usual reality condition). The fact that\nthe reality properties of fields are violated in the instanton background by polynomial factors in the\nGrassmann collective coordinates will be a constant feature of the supersymmetric instanton calculus.\nFor the applications considered below to evaluating correlation functions at leading semi-classical\norder, it turns out that we need go no further in iterating the equations-of-motion. However, it is\ninstructive to go one step further by solving for the anti-chiral fermions at order g1\/2. At this order it\nappears from (4.22c) that the source term for the anti-chiral fermion turns on. However, for the N = 2\ntheories there is a major simplification compared with the N = 4 theories. From (4.53) we can see that\nonly the components of \u03c6a which are non-trivial are of the form \u03c6a = \u03c6AB\u03a3\u00afaAB. But we recall from\n(4.14) for the N = 2 theories\n\u03a3\u00afaAB = \u01ebAB\u03a3\u00afa , \u03a3\u00afa = (\u2212i, 1) . (4.56)\nConsequently\nN = 2 : \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03a3\u00afaCD = \u01ebAB\u01ebCD\u03a3\u00afa\u03a3\u00afa = 0 (4.57)\nand so the source term for the anti-chiral fermions vanishes and the anti-chiral fermion remain zero.\nThis should be contrasted with the situation in the N = 4 theories where one can show from the\ndefinition (4.15)\nN = 4 : \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03a3\u00afaCD = 2\u01ebABCD . (4.58)\nHence, in these theories the source for \u03bb\u00afA is non-vanishing and the anti-chiral fermions are non-trivial.\nAnother way to see the difference between the N = 2 and N = 4 theories is to note that the former\nhas an abelian factor in their R-symmetry group under which the fields have the following charges\nq(An) = 0 , q(\u03bb) = 1 , q(\u03bb\u00af) = \u22121 , q(\u03c6) = 2 , q(\u03c6\u2020) = \u22122 . (4.59)\nIn the instanton background, the charge 2 component \u03c6 is non-trivial, however, it is \u03c6\u2020, the charge \u22122\ncomponent, that couples in the source for \u03bb\u00af. In the N = 4 case there is no abelian R-symmetry to pro-\nvide a similar selection rule of this kind. The existence of the abelian R-symmetry in the N = 2 theory\nmeans that no other sources are turned on and so there is fully-fledged supersymmetric generalization of\nthe bosonic instanton solution which depends on 4kN Grassmann collective coordinates. The solution\nhas An, \u03bb\nA and \u03c6a all non-trivial, where An is the original gauge field, \u03bb\nA are the zero modes of the\n58\nWeyl equation and \u03c6a is the solution (4.54). It is easy to verify that this \u201csupersymmetric instanton\u201d\nis degenerate with the original bosonic instanton and so has action \u22122\u03c0i\u03c4 . In this case, therefore, the\ninstanton effective action S\u02dc in (4.51) vanishes, as do all terms higher order in g.\nThe picture in the N = 4 theory is much more subtle. Na\u00a8\u0131vely one would think that a supersym-\nmetric instanton with 8kN Grassmann collective coordinates exists also in this case, albeit that it is\nmuch harder to find. We will argue that this is not the case. Remarkably, we will find that most of\nthe Grassmann collective coordinates, exactly the 8kN \u2212 16 of them, are not true collective coordi-\nnates in the sense of parameterizing a space of solutions of the classical equations-of-motion. In view\nof this, we shall call them quasi-collective coordinates and associate to them a quasi-instanton. They\ncorrespond to zero modes of the linearized system that are lifted by interactions. As a consequence,\nthe action of the theory evaluated on the instanton solution (4.51), actually depends non-trivially on\nthe quasi-collective coordinate modes. The only \u201cgenuine\u201d collective coordinates are those protected\nby symmetries of the theory. For the N = 4 theory these number sixteen in total, corresponding to the\nsupersymmetry and superconformal generators which, as explained in \u00a7IV.2.3, act non-trivially on the\ninstanton. These zero modes are protected by symmetries and cannot be lifted by interactions. Hence\nthe exact instanton solution of the equations-of-motion of the N = 4 theory contains only sixteen Grass-\nmann collective coordinates. The expressions for the multiplet of fields of this solution can be found\nby acting on the bosonic instanton with a series of supersymmetry transformations (4.23a)-(4.23d),\nwith the x-dependent Grassmann parameters \u03beA in (4.44) and with the re-scaling (4.42). Iterating this\n\u201csweeping-out\u201d procedure to fourth order yields\n\u03bbA = ig1\/2\u03c3mn\u03be\nA(x)Fmn ,\n\u03c6a = \u221212g\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03beA(x)\u03c3mn\u03beB(x)Fmn ,\n\u03bb\u00afA =\n1\n3\nig3\/2\u01ebABCD( \/\u00afDFmn)\u03beB(x)\n[\n\u03beC(x)\u03c3mn\u03be\nD(x)\n]\n,\nAm = Am \u2212 16g2\u01ebABCD\n[\n\u03beA(x)\u03c3mn\u03be\nB(x)\n][\n\u03beC(x)\u03c3kl\u03be\nD(x)\n]DnFkl .\n(4.60)\nHowever, this exact instanton solution is not the most convenient starting point for the semi-classical\napproximation to the functional integral. Integrating over the quadratic fluctuations in the background\nof this exact solution, one would have to introduce the additional 8kN \u2212 16 fermion zero modes of the\nDirac operator. These modes will couple to the scalar field fluctuation and in order to lift them one\nwould have to re-sum tree-level perturbative contributions in the instanton background. A much faster\nand more elegant way of addressing this problem is to modify the instanton background by including in\nit from the beginning all 8kN fermion zero modes. Thus, as in Ref. [21], we will always work with the\nquasi-instanton configuration in the N = 4 theory which is not an exact solution, but does not require\nperturbation theory to lift the quasi-zero modes.\nThe subtlety of the quasi-instanton of the N = 4 theory appears when we try to solve for the anti-\nchiral fermions (4.22c). In Appendix C (Eq. (C.34)), we show that the right-hand side of the (4.22c)\ncan be decomposed as\ng\u03a3\u00afaAB[\u03c6a, \u03bb\nB] = g1\/2\n(\n\/D\u03c8\u00afA + \u039b(NA)\n)\n. (4.61)\nHere, NA is a Grassmann odd function of the collective coordinates which satisfies the fermionic ADHM\nconstraints (4.31a) and (4.31b) whose form is written down in Appendix C, Eq. (C.44).24 This means\n24Actually the Appendix considers the more general case when the scalar fields have VEVs.\n59\nthat the second term in (4.61) is a zero mode of \/\u00afD. The expression for \u03c8A in (4.61) is also given\nin Appendix C, Eq. (C.38). Notice that the right-hand side of (4.61) has a component in the kernel\nof \/\u00afD. However this kernel is not in the image of \/D, in other words there is no \u03bb\u00afA such that \/D\u03bb\u00afA =\ng1\/2( \/D\u03c8\u00afA + \u039eA). Hence it is impossible to solve this equation-of-motion. The best that can be done is\nto set\n\u03bb\u00afA = g\n1\/2\u03c8\u00afA , (4.62)\nwhich gives the leading order O(g1\/2) expression for the anti-chiral fermion in the instanton background.\nIn particular, from the expression for \u03c8\u00afA (C.38), this solution contains a cubic dependence on the\nGrassmann collective coordinates.\nWe shall see in \u00a7V, the failure to solve the anti-chiral fermion equation-of-motion is a symptom of\nthe fact that, all but the sixteen Grassmann collective coordinates associated to broken supersymmetric\nand superconformal invariance, are lifted by interactions and so are only quasi-collective coordinates.\nThe leading order effect is captured by the order g0 term in the action (4.52). Even though an exact\nsupersymmetric instanton does not exist in the N = 4 case, dependent on all 4kN Grassmann collective\ncoordinates, the approximate solution {Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a}, the \u201cquasi-instanton\u201d, is sufficient to capture semi-\nclassical contributions to the leading order in g. The expression for the anti-chiral fermion is then only\nneeded when one considers correlations functions with explicit insertions of \u03bb\u00afA.\nIV.4 Scalar VEVs and constrained instantons\nIn this section, we examine instantons in cases where the scalar fields have non-vanishing vacuum\nexpectation values. From the outset, we emphasized that instantons are a semi-classical phenomenon\nand therefore are only expected to describe the physics of these theories in a weakly-coupled phase.\nThe N = 4 theory has a weakly coupled regime, obtained simply by taking g\u2014which does not run\u2014to\nbe arbitrarily small. In this case the theory is in a non-abelian Coulomb phase and the semi-classical\napproximation is reliable. However, the pure N = 1 and N = 2 theories (with vanishing VEVs in the\nlatter) are strongly interacting. These theories can be rendered weakly coupled by breaking the gauge\nsymmetry via the Higgs mechanism. Either the gauge symmetry is broken to an abelian subgroup,\nyielding a Coulomb phase, or it is broken completely, yielding a Higgs phase. In the N = 1 theory this\ncan only be achieved by adding matter fields, a subject that we will pursue in \u00a7VI.3 and \u00a7VII. The\nN = 2, like the N = 4, theory has adjoint-valued scalar fields, \u03c6a, which can develop a VEV driving the\ntheory into an abelian Coulomb phase. By taking the VEV to be large the theory is weakly coupled and\nsemi-classical methods can be rigorously justified. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter,\nscalar VEVs have an unfortunate side effect on instantons: strictly speaking they no longer exist! The\nway to resurrect them and make sense of the theory in the Coulomb or Higgs phase was worked out\nsome time ago by Affleck [49] (see also [50]). Instantons are replaced by \u201cconstrained instantons\u201d in\na rather technically demanding formalism. But it turns out that the constrained instanton formalism\nis a paper tiger: working to lowest order in the semi-classical expansion with constrained instantons\ninvolves only a relatively mild generalization of the instanton calculus and, moreover, one which has a\nnice geometrical interpretation in the moduli space picture. Roughly speaking, instantons are no longer\n60\ntrue minima of the action and a potential develops on Mk: instantons now have non-trivial action\nas well as entropy. In this sense constrained instanton are examples of the more general notion of a\nquasi-instanton that we have already seen in the N = 4 theory.\nIV.4.1 Constrained instantons on the Coulomb branch\nThe N = 2 and N = 4 theories contain two and six real adjoint-valued scalar fields, respectively.\nThe classical potentials of these theories have flat directions along which these scalars develop VEVs\nbreaking the gauge group to its maximal abelian subgroup by the adjoint Higgs mechanism. In the\ncase of gauge group SU(N) the unbroken subgroup is U(1)N\u22121. Without loss of generality, we can\nsimultaneously diagonalize all the components of the VEVs and we label the elements\n\u03c60a = diag\n(\n(\u03c60a)1, (\u03c6\n0\na)2, . . . , (\u03c6\n0\na)N\n)\n, (4.63)\nwith\n\u2211N\nu=1(\u03c6\n0\na)u = 0 for tracelessness. Here, and in the following, the superscript \u201c0\u201d on a scalar field\ndenotes a vacuum expectation value. Up to Weyl transformations, these VEVs parameterize a moduli\nspace of inequivalent vacua known as the Coulomb branch.\nAfter the Higgs mechanism has done its work, the diagonal components of all the fields remain\nmassless whereas the off-diagonal components gain masses |(\u03c60a)u \u2212 (\u03c60a)v|. The N = 2 theory is\nasymptotically free with dynamical scale \u039b. The running of the coupling is cut-off in the IR at a\nscale set by the masses of the off-diagonal components. Thus, as long as we choose VEVs such that\n|(\u03c60a)u \u2212 (\u03c60a)v| \u226b \u039b, for all u, v, the theory is weakly coupled at all length scales and semi-classical\n(instanton) methods should be reliable. In contrast, the coupling constant of the N = 4 theory does\nnot run and we may achieve weak coupling simply by setting g2 \u226a 1, either on the Coulomb branch or\nat the conformal point where the non-abelian gauge symmetry is restored.\nAs we mentioned in the introduction to this Chapter, in the background of scalar VEVs, instantons\nare no longer exact solutions of the equations-of-motion due to Derrick\u2019s Theorem [51]. The action can\nalways be lowered by shrinking an instanton, so the the size of the configuration cannot be a genuine\nmodulus when the VEVs are turned on. The way to implement the semi-classical approximation around\ninstanton quasi-solutions in theories with symmetry breaking was developed by Affleck [49, 50]. For\nsimplicity, we review this approach in the context of a single BPST instanton of scale size \u03c1. The basic\nidea is to introduce a new operator, or \u201cAffleck constraint\u201d, into the action by means of a Faddeev-\nPopov insertion of unity. If this operator is of suitably high dimension Derrick\u2019s theorem is avoided and\ninstantons stabilize at a fixed scale size \u03c1. The integration over the Faddeev-Popov Lagrange multiplier\ncan then be traded off for the integration over \u03c1. The now-stable solutions are known as constrained\ninstantons. Of course, the detailed shape of the constrained instanton depends in a complicated way\non one\u2019s choice of constraint, but certain important features remain constraint independent, namely:\n(i) The short-distance regime, x\u226a 1\/(g\u03c60).25 In this regime the equations-of-motion can be solved\nperturbatively in g2\u03c12\u03c60; since ultimately, as seen ex post facto in \u00a7V.2, the integration over scale size\n25Here, \u03c60 is the characteristic scale of the VEVs.\n61\nis dominated by \u03c1 . 1\/\u03c60 this is tantamount to perturbation theory in g. As the constraints do not\nenter into these equations until some high order, the first few terms in this expansion are robust. In\nparticular, to leading order in the semi-classical approximation, the gauge fields and fermions are equal\nto their BPST expressions while the scalar fields undergo a minor modification to take account of the\nVEV.\n(ii) The long-distance regime, x \u226b 1\/(g\u03c60). The long-distance \u201ctail\u201d of the instanton reflects the\nHiggs mechanism. In the model at hand, the instanton component fields which gain a mass via the\nHiggs mechanism decay exponentially. In contrast, the diagonal components of the fields fall off as\npowers of \u03c12\/x2. It is an important assumption of the constrained instanton method that to leading\norder in the semi-classical approximation, the long-range behaviour of these massless fields is simply an\nextrapolation of the BPST core.26 So for the massless components the BPST form of the solution is all\nthat one needs to discuss the instanton on all length scales (at leading order). However, even for the\nmassive fields the BPST form often suffices, even though it is not correct at large distance. The reason\nis that the error made in using the BPST form rather than the actual exponential fall off is higher order\nin the coupling.\nThe most important conclusion of the constrained instanton method is that to leading order, small\nconstrained instantons are well approximated by ordinary BPST instantons. But since these are the\nones that are favoured by the now size-sensitive action of the constrained instanton, little error is made\nby replacing the constrained instanton by a conventional instanton. We will apply the same reasoning\nto the case of arbitrary topological charge to find that the core of the required constrained instanton is\nmore or less the ADHM instanton that we have constructed: the gauge field assumes its ADHM form,\n(2.49), and the fermions \u03bbA are the linear combination of zero modes of \/\u00afD, (4.29). The scalar field\ncontinues to obey (4.53) but now the boundary condition on \u03c6a is that it must approach the VEV \u03c6\n0\na\nat large distance from the instanton. The general solution with VEV [25] is derived in Appendix C\n(Eq. (C.25))\n\u03c6a = \u221214\u03a3\u00afaABU\u00afMAfM\u00afBU + U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a1[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\nU , (4.64)\nwith\n\u03d5a = L\n\u22121\n(\n1\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaABM\u00afAMB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (4.65)\nThat this has the requisite boundary condition (4.63) can be verified using the asymptotic formulae in\n\u00a7II.4.3.\nAs long as we work to leading order in g, the Affleck constraint does not explicitly appear and\nfurthermore there is no need to iterate the instanton solution any further. Just as in the N = 4 theory\nwith zero VEV, the quasi-instanton solution {Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a} is sufficient to capture the leading order\nsemi-classical approximation of the functional integral, as we describe in \u00a7V.\n26In principle, this simple patching of the short and long distance behaviour is modified at higher order in a way that\nis dependent on the precise form of the Affleck constraint.\n62\nIV.5 Collective coordinate supersymmetry\nIn \u00a7IV.2.3, we saw that chiral supersymmetry transformations on the bosonic instanton generate fermion\nzero modes: these are the supersymmetries that are broken by the purely bosonic instanton. Once, the\nfermion zero modes are turned on, the other half of the supersymmetry generators, the anti-chiral\nones which left unbroken the bosonic instanton, now act non-trivially on the super-instanton. It turns\nout, as we uncover in this section, that the supersymmetry transformations on the super-instanton\ncan be traded for supersymmetry transformations on the collective coordinates themselves. In fact\nthe unbroken supersymmetries of the ADHM background are linearly realized on the bosonic and\nfermionic collective coordinates. This is an example of a general feature of BPS saturated solitons and\ncorresponding higher-dimensional extended objects (i.e. branes). In all of these cases the unbroken\nsupersymmetries are linearly realized in the world-volume theory. Invariance under these symmetries\nis an important constraint which must be satisfied by the super-instanton measure we will construct in\nthe next section.\nTo find the transformations, we need to consider the supersymmetry variation of the gauge field\nAm and fermions \u03bb\nA in the background of the non-linear supersymmetric instanton solution. By the\nlatter, we mean the solution with Am and \u03bb\nA equal to their ADHM forms, (2.49) and (4.29), and\nwith the scalar fields given by (4.64). In the N = 4 case, or on the Coulomb branch of the N = 2\ntheory, this quasi-instanton configuration, as we have already described in \u00a7IV.3 and \u00a7IV.4, is only\nan approximate solution to the equations-of-motion, but, nevertheless, provides a convenient way of\ncapturing the leading order semi-classical contribution to the functional integral. As a symptom of the\nnon-exactness of the instanton solution in these cases, supersymmetry transformations on the fields, as\nwell as transforming the collective coordinates, also turn on components of the fields at a higher order\nin the semi-classical expansion. We have already seen this phenomena as the \u201csweeping-out\u201d procedure\nthat led to the expressions for \u03c6a, \u03bb\u00afA and Am in (4.60).\nWe start by considering the supersymmetry variation of the gauge field (4.23a). Since the anti-chiral\nfermions vanish, we have\n\u03b4A\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = 2ig\n\u22121\/2\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\u03bbA\u03b1 \u2261 2g\u22121\u039b\u03b1\n(\ni\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AMA\n)\n. (4.66)\nHere, for convenience we have re-scaled\n\u03be\u00afA \u2192 g\u22121\/2\u03be\u00afA . (4.67)\nComparing this with (2.110), the variation of the gauge field up to a local gauge transformation, under\na variation of the c-number collective coordinates, we deduce the simple rule\n\u03b4a\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AMA , \u03b4a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AM\u00afA . (4.68)\nThis leaves the transformations of the Grassmann collective coordinates which are deduced by con-\nsidering the variation of the fermions (4.23b). We have already shown how the first term lifts to the\ncollective coordinates in \u00a7IV.2.3 but for consistency and contrary to (4.69), we should re-scale\n\u03beA \u2192 g1\/2\u03beA . (4.69)\n63\nThe second term involves an expression which is higher-order in the VEVs and Grassmann collective\ncoordinates of O(g3\/2). In other words this term does not contribute to \u03b4\u03bb(0)A but rather the next term\n\u03b4\u03bb(1)A in th expansion (4.47). This is example of the sweeping-out procedure turning on a higher-order\nterm in the semi-classical expansion of a field. Note with vanishing VEVs and N < 4 supersymmetry\nthis term vanishes. The final term is O(g\u22121\/2) and in Appendix C (Eq. (C.45)), we show how it lifts\nto a variation of the Grassmann collective coordinates. Putting the two variations, from the first and\nthird terms, together, we have\n\u03b4MA = \u22124i\u03beA\u03b1 b\u03b1 + 2i\u03a3ABa Ca\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B , \u03b4M\u00afA = \u22124i\u03be\u03b1Ab\u00af\u03b1 + 2i\u03a3ABa \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9BC\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a , (4.70)\nwhere\nCa\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\na\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5a , C\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a = a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\n\u2212 \u03d5aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , (4.71)\nwhere \u03d5a was defined in (4.65) in the context of the scalar field equation. Notice that with the re-scaling\n(4.67) and (4.69), all g-dependence drops out of (4.70).\nThe anti-chiral supersymmetry transformation also turn on the anti-chiral fermions at O(g1\/2):\n\u03b4\u03bb\u00afA = \u2212ig1\/2\u03a3abAB \u03be\u00afB[\u03c6a, \u03c6b] . (4.72)\nAgain, this is a symptom of the fact that the quasi-instanton is not an exact solution to the equation-\nof-motion.27 Nevertheless, the supersymmetry transformations on the collective coordinates that we\nhave derived in (4.68) and (4.70) will turn out to be symmetries of the leading-order semi-classical\napproximation of the functional integral.\n27Except for N < 4, with zero VEVs, in which case (4.72) vanishes.\n64\nV The Supersymmetric Collective Coordinate Integral\nThis Chapter is a companion to the previous one and in it we consider how the supersymmetric instan-\nton is used to implement the semi-classical approximation of the functional integral in the context of a\nsupersymmetric gauge theory. As we have already seen, there are extra subtleties in the supersymmetric\ncase arising from the existence of quasi-zero modes. In this Chapter we show how the procedure that\nwe adopted to solve the equations-of-motion is precisely in accord with an expansion in g2. First of all,\nin \u00a7V.1 we describe how the semi-classical approximation of the functional integral leads to a supersym-\nmetrized version of the collective coordinate integral in which the Grassmann collective coordinates are\nalso integrated over. We show that, even though the non-trivial parts of the fluctuation determinants\ncancel between bosonic and fermionic fluctuations, there is still, in general, a non-trivial integrand\nwhich arises as a consequence of quasi-zero modes. In fact the integrand involves the exponential of\nthe \u201cinstanton effective action\u201d, a suitably supersymmetrized potential on the instanton moduli space.\nIn the case of constrained instantons the instanton effective action penalizes large instantons but, even\nwhen the VEVs vanish it is a non-trivial function of the Grassmann collective coordinates in the N = 4\ntheory. The instanton effective action is constructed and analysed in \u00a7V.2. In \u00a7V.3 we find an expres-\nsion for the supersymmetric volume form on the instanton moduli space. As in the pure gauge theory,\nthe hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction plays a central ro\u02c6le here. Finally, in \u00a7V.3.1, we show how the\nsupersymmetry of the underlying field theory is manifested on the collective coordinates.\nV.1 The supersymmetric collective coordinate measure\nIn order to implement the semi-classical approximation we must expand around the bosonic instanton\nsolution. In this section, we will initially consider the case where the VEVs vanish, so avoiding the\ncomplications of the constrained instanton. The gauge field is expanded as in (3.1) and (3.5) where we\nrecall that the fluctuations are split into the zero mode piece and the component orthogonal to the zero\nmodes; the latter being denoted A\u02dcn. The fermions are treated in a similar way: we separate out the\nzero modes of \/\u00afD and write the chiral fermion as\n\u03bbA(x) = g\u22121\/2\u03bb(0)A(x;X,\u03c8A) + \u03bb\u02dcA(x;X,\u03c8) . (5.1)\nThe 2kN Grassmann collective coordinates, for each species, are denoted by \u03c8A. Since the anti-chiral\nfermions and scalar field have no zero modes in an instanton background we continue to denote them\nas \u03bb\u00afA and \u03c6a.\nThe functional integral over the fermions can be factorized into integrals over the Grassmann col-\nlective coordinates \u03c8A and the non-zero mode fluctuations; schematically28\u222b N\u220f\nA=1\n[d\u03bbA] [d\u03bb\u00afA] = g\nkNN\n\u222b N\u220f\nA=1\n{ \u220f2kN\ni=1 d\u03c8\niA\nPfaff 1\n2\n\u2126(X)\n[d\u03bb\u02dcA] [d\u03bb\u00afA]\n}\n. (5.2)\n28The factor of gkNN arises from the factor of g\u22121\/2 included in the definition of each fermion zero modes in (4.29).\n65\nHere, \u2126(X) is the anti-symmetric 2kN \u00d7 2kN matrix defined by the functional inner-product of the\nzero-modes (4.39): \u222b\nd4x trN \u03bb\n(0)(x;X,\u03c8A)\u03bb(0)(x;X,\u03c8B) = \u22121\n4\n\u03b4AB\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\niA\u03c8jB (5.3)\nand the Pfaffian ensures that the integral is invariant under re-parameterizations of the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates.\nWe now plug the expansion of the fields into the action of theory we obtain\nS[g\u22121A(0)m + A\u02dcm, g\n\u22121\/2\u03bb(0)A + \u03bb\u02dcA, \u03bb\u00afA, \u03c6a] = \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 + Skin + Sint . (5.4)\nHere, the second term denotes the kinetic terms for the non-zero mode fluctuations:29\nSkin =\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u02dc\u00afA\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u2206(+)\u03b1\n\u03b2A\u02dc\u03b2\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 2Dn\u03bb\u00afA\u03c3\u00afn\u03bb\u02dcA +Dn\u03c6aDn\u03c6a\n}\n(5.5)\nand the third term includes the interactions between the zero and non-zero modes:\nSint =\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\n\u2212 \u03bb(0)A\u03a3\u00afaAB [\u03c6a, \u03bb(0)B]\u2212 2g1\/2[A\u02dcn, \u03bb\u00afA]\u03c3\u00afn\u03bb(0)A \u2212 2g1\/2\u03bb(0)A\u03a3\u00afaAB [\u03c6a, \u03bb\u02dcB] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n}\n. (5.6)\nThe remaining terms, whose presence is indicated by the ellipsis are higher order in g. We have also\nnot written down any terms involving the zero-mode piece of the gauge field because, as we saw in\n\u00a7III.1, once the integrals of the expansion parameters of the zero modes, the \u03be\u00b5 in (3.5), are traded for\nintegrals over the collective coordinates X\u00b5, at leading order the \u03be\u00b5 are set to zero.\nWe can now integrate over the non-zero modes {A\u02dcm, \u03bb\u02dcA, \u03bb\u00afA, \u03c6a}, and ghosts. This defines a kind of\neffective action on the collective coordinates Seff , which we call the instanton effective action:\ne\u2212Seff def= e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b\n[dA\u02dc] [db] [dc] [d\u03bb\u02dc] [d\u03bb\u00af] [d\u03c6] e\u2212Skin\u2212Sint\u2212Sgh . (5.7)\nThe instanton effective action is only non-vanishing in the N = 4 theory (or more generally in the\nN = 1 and N = 2 theories with non-vanishing VEVs) when the supersymmetric instanton is not\nan exact solution to the equations of motion. We can think of (5.5) and (5.6) as specifying a set of\nFeynman rules which determines Seff perturbatively in g. Only the non-zero mode pieces of the fields\nactually propagate and, in particular, the zero modes of the fermions \u03bb(0)A are non-propagating and\nact as sources. When we integrate out the fluctuations the second and third terms in (5.6) will not\ncontribute at the leading g0 order since they are order g1\/2; only the first term which is linear in the\nfluctuation of the scalar field is relevant. We can include the leading order effect in an efficient way via\na shift of the scalar field by \u03c6(0)a , the solution to the equation\nD2\u03c6(0)a = \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bb(0)A\u03bb(0)B . (5.8)\nThis equation is identical to one which we solved in \u00a7IV.3 and yields an expression for \u03c6a which is bi-\nlinear in the Grassmann collective coordinates. So when working to leading order in g, it is convenient\n29In the following, as previously, all covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the bosonic instanton solution\n(2.49).\n66\nto think of the background configuration of the instanton as being the multiplet {Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a}, defined\nin (2.49), (4.29) and (4.64). Notice that as we explained in the introduction to Chapter IV, the solution\nfor the scalar field has terms bilinear the Grassmann collective coordinates which violates the reality\ncondition on the field: \u03c6\u2020a is no longer the Hermitian conjugate of \u03c6a. However, as we explained, there\nis no inconsistency.\nOnce we have shifted the scalar field, the fluctuations can be integrated out. At leading order this\nyields the usual determinant factors. The gauge field and ghosts have already been dealt with in \u00a7III.1,\nwhile for the fermions we obtain\nPfaff \u2032\n(\n0 \/D\n\/\u00afD 0\n)\ndef\n=\n\u2223\u2223\u2223det\u2032( 0 \/D\/\u00afD 0\n)2 \u2223\u2223\u22231\/4 = \u2223\u2223det\u2032\u2206(+) \u00b7 det\u2206(\u2212)\u2223\u22231\/4 , (5.9)\nfor each flavour of fermion and where \u2206(\u00b1) are defined in (2.28a) and (2.28b). In (5.9), the prime,\nas usual, indicates that \u2206(+) has zero modes and the determinant must be taken over the subspace\northogonal to the zero mode space. Finally, the integrals over the scalar field fluctuation \u03c6\u02dca simply\ngives an additional factor of [det(\u2212D2)]1\u2212N . Putting the determinant factors together we have\u2223\u2223\u2223det(\u2212D2)\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223det\u2032\u2206(+)\u2223\u2223N\/4 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223det\u2206(\u2212)\u2223\u2223N\/4 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223det(\u2212D2)\u2223\u22231\u2212N = \u2223\u2223\u2223det\u2032\u2206(+)\ndet\u2206(\u2212)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223N\/4\u22121 , (5.10)\nusing (2.29) valid in an instanton background.\nThere are two leading-order g0 contributions to Seff . The first contribution arises from evaluating\nthe action of the theory on the multiplet {Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a}. This is simply the quantity S\u02dc defined in (4.52).\nThe second contribution comes from the determinants (5.10). Putting these together we have\nSeff = \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 +\n{\nS\u02dc + (N \/4\u2212 1) log [det\u2032\u2206(+)\/det\u2206(\u2212)]}g0 +O(g2) (5.11)\nAs we described in \u00a7III.3, the ratio of determinants in (5.11) is simply a power of the Pauli-Villars mass\nscale:\ndet\u2032\u2206(+)\ndet\u2206(\u2212)\n= \u00b5\u22124Nk . (5.12)\nThis cancelling of the determinants, up to a constant factor, is perhaps the biggest simplification that\noccurs for instantons in a supersymmetric gauge theory [34]. Recall that S\u02dc is an expression quartic\nin the Grassmann collective coordinates. In the N = 1 theory, there are no scalar fields, so this term\ncannot appear. In the N = 2 theory with zero VEVs, this term also vanishes because the multiplet\n{Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a} is an exact solution to the equations-of-motion. With zero VEVs, it is only in the N = 4\ntheory that this contribution to S\u02dc is non-vanishing as we shall find by explicit evaluation in \u00a7V.2.\nIncluding the bosonic parts of the functional integral as described in \u00a7III.1, the final expression for\nthe leading-order semi-classical approximation of the functional integral in the charge-k sector is(\u00b5\ng\n)kN(4\u2212N )\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b \u221a\ndet g(X)[\nPfaff 1\n2\n\u2126\n]N { 4kN\u220f\n\u00b5=1\ndX\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\nN\u220f\nA=1\n2kN\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03c8iA\n}\ne\u2212S\u02dc(X,\u03c8) . (5.13)\nSo the final expression for the leading-order semi-classical approximation of the functional integral\nin the k-instanton sector is simply a multiple of the supersymmetrized volume form on the instanton\n67\nmoduli space Mk with an integrand involving the instanton effective action S\u02dc:\u222b\n[dA] [d\u03bb] [d\u03c6] [db] [dc] e\u2212S\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\ncharge-k\ng\u21920\u2212\u2192\n(\u00b5\ng\n)kN(4\u2212N )\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N )e\u2212S\u02dc , (5.14)\nwhere we have defined an N supersymmetric volume form on Mk:\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ) def=\n\u222b \u221a\ndet g(X)[\nPfaff 1\n2\n\u2126(X)\n]N 4kN\u220f\n\u00b5=1\ndX\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\nN\u220f\nA=1\n2kN\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03c8iA . (5.15)\nWe will refer to the quantity\nZ\n(N )\nk =\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N )e\u2212S\u02dc , (5.16)\nas the instanton partition function since it has the form of a partition function of a zero dimensional field\ntheory. Later in Chapter X we will see that for N > 1 it can be viewed as the dimensional reduction of\nthe partition function of a higher-dimensional field theory. Specifically for N = 2, respectively N = 4,\nthe field theory is a two-dimensional, respectively four-dimensional, \u03c3-model with Mk as the target\nspace. This point-of-view leads very naturally to the relation of the instanton calculus to the dynamics\nof D-branes in string theory described in \u00a7X.3.\nIn the pure N = 1 and N = 2 theories, the pre-factors of the collective coordinates measures (5.14)\ncan be related to the renormalization group invariant \u039b-parameters. The point is that the coupling g\nmust run with the Pauli-Villars mass scale in such a way that the combination in front of the measure\nis a renormalization group invariant. This defines the \u039b-parameters in the Pauli-Villars scheme:\n\u039b3NN=1 = \u00b5\n3Ng(\u00b5)\u22122Ne\u22128\u03c0\n2\/g(\u00b5)2+i\u03b8 , \u039b2NN=2 = \u00b5\n2Ne\u22128\u03c0\n2\/g(\u00b5)2+i\u03b8 . (5.17)\n(Notice that the powers of g in (5.14) and (5.17) do not match. The additional powers of g come from\nthe insertions when one calculates correlations functions.) On the contrary, the N = 4 theory is finite,\nthe coupling does not run and as a consequence the integration measure (5.14) is independent of the\nPauli-Villars mass scale \u00b5.\nV.2 The instanton effective action\nIn this section, we evaluate the leading order contribution to the instanton effective action S\u02dc in (4.52).\nWhen the scalar fields have a non-trivial VEV, the semi-classical approximation proceeds via Affleck\u2019s\nconstraint method as explained in \u00a7IV.4. In this case, the scale sizes of instantons cease to be true moduli\nand the instanton effective action will be a non-trivial function on Mk which breaks superconformal\ninvariance.30 However, the now quasi -collective coordinates are still to be integrated over in the semi-\nclassical approximation of the functional integral. Furthermore, the Affleck constraint, at leading order,\ndoes not explicitly appear and further discussion of it is unnecessary. To leading order, the net effect\nof introducing the VEV is to change the boundary condition on \u03c6a, as indicated in (4.64) and this will\nfeed into the instanton effective action S\u02dc in a way we now calculate.\n30In the N = 4 case, this is in addition to the non-trivial instanton effective action that is present even when the VEVs\nvanish.\n68\nWith an integration by parts together with the scalar equation-of-motion, Eq. (4.52) may be re-cast\nas31\nS\u02dc =\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\n\u2202ntrN\n(\n\u03c6aDn\u03c6a\n)\u2212 1\n2\ngtrN \u03bb\nA\u03a3\u00afaAB[\u03c6a, \u03bb\nB]\n}\n. (5.18)\nThe first term, being a total derivative may be converted to a surface integral over the sphere at infinity\nin spacetime. Since it is gauge invariant we can evaluate it in any convenient gauge. In particular, in\nsingular gauge defined in \u00a7II.4.3, Eqs. (2.105) and (4.64) imply, in the limit of large x,\nxn\nx\nDn\u03c6a x\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 1\nx3\n(\n1\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\nA\u00b5\u00afB + w\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a + \u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 2w\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (5.19)\nHence, the first term in (5.18) is\n4\u03c02trk\n[\n1\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaAB \u00b5\u00af\nA\u03c60a\u00b5\nB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5a\n]\n. (5.20)\nThe second term can be evaluated by using the identity (C.34) in Appendix C:\n\u03a3\u00afaAB[\u03c6a,\u039b(MB)] = \/D\u03c8\u00afA + \u039b(NA) . (5.21)\nThen\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\u039b(MA)\n(\n\/D\u03c8\u00afA +\u039b(NA)\n)\n= \u22121\n2\n\u222b\nd4x\n(\n\u2202ntrN \u039b(MA)\u03c3n\u03c8\u00afA + trN \u039b(MA)\u039b(NA)\n)\n. (5.22)\nIn the first term, we have used the fact \/\u00afD\u03bbA = 0 to pull the derivative outside the trace. One can\nverify that for large x, \u03c8\u00af \u223c x\u22122 and \u03bb \u223c x\u22123; hence, the first term on the right-hand side of (5.22) gives\na vanishing contribution at infinity and may be dropped. The second term can be evaluated using the\ninner-product formula (4.37):\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u039b(MA)\u039b(NA) = \u2212\u03c0\n2\n4\ntrk\n[M\u00afA(P\u221e + 1)NA + N\u00afA(P\u221e + 1)MA]\n= \u03c02\u03a3\u00afaABtrk\n[\n\u00b5\u00afA\u03c60a\u00b5\nB \u2212 M\u00afAMB\u03d5a\n]\n,\n(5.23)\nwhere we used the expression for NA in (C.44) Appendix C:\nNA = \u2212\u03a3\u00afaAB\n{ (\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\nMB \u2212MB\u03d5a\n}\n+ 2\n(\n0 0\n0 G\u03b1\u02d9A\n)\na\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 2a\u03b1\u02d9G\u03b1\u02d9A . (5.24)\nHere, G\u03b1\u02d9A is a quantity needed to ensure that NA satisfy the fermionic ADHM constraints (4.34), but\nwhich, as one can show by explicit substitution, does not contribute to (5.23).\nAssembling all the pieces, the leading-order contribution to the instanton effective action is\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02trk\n{\n1\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00af\nA\u03c60a\u00b5\nB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u03d5aL\u03d5a\n}\n= 4\u03c02trk\n{\n1\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00af\nA\u03c60a\u00b5\nB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2212\n(\n1\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaABM\u00afAMB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\n)\nL\n\u22121\n(\n1\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaCDM\u00afCMD + w\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b2\u02d9\n)}\n.\n(5.25)\n31In the following {Am, \u03bbA, \u03c6a} take the ADHM expressions (2.49), (4.29) and (4.64).\n69\nOne can verify explicitly that the expression above is invariant under the supersymmetry transforma-\ntions (4.68) and (4.70). Notice in the N = 2 theory when the VEVs vanish S\u02dc = 0. However, in\nthe N = 4 theory with vanishing VEVs, S\u02dc remains a non-trivial expression quartic in the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates:\nS\u02dc = \u2212\u03c0\n2\n2\n\u01ebABCDtrk\n(M\u00afAMBL\u22121M\u00afCMD) . (5.26)\nThis reflects the fact that in the N = 4 theory the super-instanton is not an exact solution of the\nequations-of-motion.\nV.2.1 Geometric interpretation\nThe terms in the instanton effective (5.25) have an elegant interpretation in terms of the geometry of\nMk. To start with, the quartic coupling is precisely the coupling of the Grassmann-valued symplectic\ntangent vectors MA to the symplectic curvature of Mk:\nS\u02dc =\n1\n96\n\u01ebABCDR(MA,MB,MC,MD) = 1\n96\n\u01ebABCDRijkl\u03c8\niA\u03c8jB\u03c8kC\u03c8lD . (5.27)\nThe second expression is written in terms of the intrinsic coordinates \u03c8A. Here, R is the symplectic\ncurvature of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient space Mk. It is a totally symmetric tensor in the Sp(n) indices.\nIn Appendix B we derive a general formula (B.48) for the symplectic curvature of a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient in terms of the curvature and connection of the mother space M\u02dc. Using the relation (4.35)\nand the explicit representation of the generators of the U(k) symmetry in Eq. (2.69), we find\nMi\u02dcA(\u2126\u02dcT r )\u02dci j\u02dcMj\u02dcB \u2261 \u22124\u03c02itrk T r\n(M\u00afAMB \u2212 M\u00afBMA) . (5.28)\nHence, using the formula for the symplectic curvature (B.48) (in terms of the ADHM variables Mi\u02dcA =\nMi\u02dc(\u03c8A, X)) and the definition of Lrs in Eq. (2.124), we have\n1\n96\n\u01ebABCDRijkl\u03c8\niA\u03c8jB\u03c8kC\u03c8lD\n=\n1\n16\n\u01ebABCD\n\u2211\nrs\n[\nMi\u02dcA(\u2126\u02dcT r)\u02dci j\u02dcMj\u02dcB\n]\nL\n\u22121\nrs\n[\nMk\u02dcC(\u2126\u02dcT s)k\u02dc l\u02dcMl\u02dcD\n]\n= \u2212\u03c0\n2\n2\n\u01ebABCDtrk\n(M\u00afAMBL\u22121M\u00afCMD) .\n(5.29)\nwhich is precisely (5.26).\nThe pieces of the instanton effective action which do not depend on the Grassmann collective co-\nordinates also have a very concrete geometrical interpretation in terms of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient\nconstruction. The first observation is that the SU(N) gauge symmetry of the theory acts as a group\nof isometries on the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient space. Firstly, consider the SU(N) isometries generated by\nthe Killing vectors\nV\u02dc = iw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\n\u2202\n\u2202w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iv\n\u2212 iwui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2202\n\u2202wiv\u03b1\u02d9\n(5.30)\non the mother space M\u02dc. This group action descend to act as isometries on the quotient Mk. To see\nthis, it suffices to notice that the moment maps are invariant: V\u02dc \u00b5Xr = 0. In fact the group action\n70\nis also holomorphic with respect to each of the three independent complex structures, LV\u02dc I\u02dc\n(c)\n= 0, a\nproperty that can be easily be shown to be inherited by the action on the quotient. Consequently the\nvector fields generated by the group action are tri-holomorphic.\nNow consider a set of such isometries associated to U(1)N\u22121 \u2282 U(N) picked out by the VEVs of the\nscalar field:\nV\u02dca = iw\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\niu(\u03c6\n0\na)u\n\u2202\n\u2202w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\n\u2212 i(\u03c60a)uwui\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202\n\u2202wiu\u03b1\u02d9\n. (5.31)\nThis action, as described above is tri-holomorphic on the quotient space Mk. The lifts of the Killing\nvectors on the quotient Mk, Va, are equal to projection of the V\u02dca to H \u2282 TN. The bosonic parts of the\naction (5.25) are then equal to a sum over the inner-products of the vectors Va:\n4\u03c02trk\n[\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9L\u22121w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\n]\n= 1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X)V\n\u00b5\na V\n\u03bd\na , (5.32)\nwhere g is the metric on the quotient space. As explained in \u00a7II.4.1 (and more fully in Appendix B)\nthe metric on the quotient space g(X, Y ) is equal to g\u02dc(X, Y ), the metric on the mother space evaluated\non the lifts of X and Y . Hence,\ng(Va, Va) = g\u02dc(Va, Va) = g\u02dc(V\u02dca, V\u02dca)\u2212 g\u02dc(V\u02dc \u22a5a , V\u02dc \u22a5a ) , (5.33)\nwhere V\u02dc \u22a5a is the projection of V\u02dca to the vertical subspace V. The U(1)\nN\u22121 group action on M\u02dc is\ntri-holomorphic, hence g\u02dc(V\u02dca, I\n(c)Xr) = 0, so that V\u02dca already lies in the tangent space of the level set\nTN \u2282 TM\u02dc. Since the vectors Xr, r = 1, . . . , k2, form a basis for the vertical subspace,\nV\u02dc \u22a5a =\n\u2211\nrs\nXrL\n\u22121\nrs g\u02dc(Xs, V\u02dca) (5.34)\nand so\ng(Va, Va) = g\u02dc(V\u02dca, V\u02dca)\u2212\n\u2211\nrs\ng\u02dc(V\u02dca, Xr)L\n\u22121\nrs g\u02dc(Xs, V\u02dca) . (5.35)\nThe matrix of inner-products Lrs is given in (2.124). By explicit calculation we have\ng\u02dc(V\u02dca, V\u02dca) = 8\u03c0\n2trk\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u03c6\n0\naw\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n, g\u02dc(V\u02dca, Xr) = 8\u03c0\n2trk\n(\nT rw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (5.36)\nSubstituting these expressions in (5.35) gives (5.32).\nThe remaining terms in (5.25) involving the Grassmann collective coordinates can also be given a\ngeometric interpretation. First of all, we recall from \u00a7IV.2.2 that, from a geometric perspective, the\nGrassmann collective coordinates are Grassmann-valued symplectic tangent vectors to the instanton\nmoduli space. The action of the U(1)N\u22121 symmetry on the Grassmann collective coordinates generated\nby the vector fields V\u02dca in (5.31) is simply\n\u03b4a\u00b5\nA\nui = i(\u03c6\n0\na)u\u00b5\nA\nui , \u03b4a\u00b5\u00af\nA\niu = i\u00b5\u00af\nA\niu(\u03c6\n0\na)u , \u03b4aM\u2032Aij\u03b1 = 0 , (5.37)\nwhich defines \u03b4aMA. This variation can be written in a completely geometric way using the (flat)\nconnection on the mother space:\n\u03b4aMi\u02dcA =\n(\u2207\u02dcj\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 V\u02dc i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9a )Mj\u02dcA . (5.38)\n71\nWe now show that the Grassmann terms in the instanton effective action (5.25) can be interpreted in\nterms of the intrinsic geometry of Mk as\n2\u03c02\u03a3\u00afaABtrk\n{\n\u00b5\u00afA\u03c60a\u00b5\nB \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9L\u22121M\u00afAMB\n}\n= i\n4\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\niA\n(\u2207k\u03b1\u02d9V j\u03b1\u02d9a )\u03c8kB .

(5.41)\nPutting this together with (5.36), and using (2.124), we have proved (5.39).\nTo summarize, the instanton effective action (5.25) can be written in an elegant way involving only\nthe intrinsic geometry of Mk:\nS\u02dc = 1\n2\n{\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X)V\n\u00b5\na V\n\u03bd\na +\ni\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\niA\n(\u2207k\u03b1\u02d9V j\u03b1\u02d9a )\u03c8kB + 148\u01ebABCDRijkl\u03c8iA\u03c8jB\u03c8kC\u03c8lD} . (5.42)\nWe will see in \u00a7X that this effective action can be obtained from a non-trivial dimensional reduction of\na \u03c3-model in two and six dimensions, for N = 2 and N = 4, respectively, with the instanton moduli\nspace Mk as target.\nV.2.2 The size of a constrained instanton\nHaving derived the leading order expression for the instanton effective action, (5.25) or (5.42), we can,\nex post facto, justify the main assumption of the constrained instanton method that there is an effective\ncut-off on large instanton sizes. First of all, since the bosonic part of the instanton effective action is\nsimply (5.32), we can identify the minima of S\u02dc as fixed points of the U(1)N\u22121 action on the instanton\nmoduli space Mk. Since the construction of Mk involves a quotient by U(k), the fixed-point condition\nis (\n\u03c60a\n)\nu\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 = wuj\u03b1\u02d9(\u03c7a)ji , [a\n\u2032\nn, \u03c7a] = 0 , (5.43)\nin addition to the ADHM constraints (2.65). Here, \u03c7a are k\u00d7k Hermitian matrices acting as infinitesimal\ncompensating transformation in the auxiliary group U(k) which can depend on the VEVs \u03c60a. For generic\nvalues of the VEVs the solution of the equations (5.43) are as follows. At least until we impose the\nADHM constraints, each fixed-point set is associated to the partition\nk \u2192 k1 + k2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ kN , (5.44)\nup to the U(k) auxiliary symmetry. Each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k} is then associated to a given u by a map ui\nas follows:{\n1, 2, . . . , k1\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nu=1\n, k1 + 1, . . . , k1 + k2\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nu=2\n, . . . ,\n. . . , k1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ ku\u22121 + 1, . . . , k1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ ku\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nu\n, . . . , . . . , k1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ kN\u22121 + 1, . . . , k\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nu=N\n} (5.45)\n72\nFor a given partition the variables have a block-diagonal form\n(\u03c7a)ij = \u2212(\u03c60a)ui\u03b4ij , wui\u03b1\u02d9 \u221d \u03b4uui , (a\u2032n)ij \u221d \u03b4uiuj . (5.46)\nNow we impose the ADHM constraints (2.65). In the uth block the constraints are of the form of a\nset of ADHM constraints for ku instantons for which N = 1. In fact the N blocks each correspond to\nthe N U(1) subgroups of the gauge group picked out by the VEVs.32 Taking the trace of the ADHM\nconstraints within the block removes the a\u2032n dependent terms to leave equations of the form\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\nku\u2211\ni=ku\u22121+1\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9iuwui\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (5.47)\nHowever, the solution to these equations is wui\u03b1\u02d9 = 0. Therefore the structure of the partitions collapses\nto leave, up to the U(k) symmetry, a\u2032n and \u03c7a diagonal:\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 , a\n\u2032\nn = \u2212diag\n(\nX1n, . . . , X\nk\nn\n)\n. (5.48)\nTaking the solution above fixes all of the auxiliary symmetry apart from permutations; hence, the\nfixed-point space is simply Symk R4, the symmetric product of k points in R4. So the fixed-point set\ndescribes a configuration where all the instantons has shrunk down to zero size. It is easy to verify that\nthe gauge potential on this singular subspace is pure gauge. As the sizes of the instantons grow, the\neffective action favours instantons with sizes up to a scale \u223c 1\/\u03c60, where \u03c60 is the characteristic scale\nof the VEVs, after which they are exponentially suppressed. Therefore, constrained instantons have a\nnatural cut-off on the their scale size.\nV.2.3 The lifting of zero modes\nOf paramount importance for applications is the process of lifting fermion zero modes encoded in the\ninstanton effective action. First of all, consider the case with vanishing VEVs. In this case, the only\ngenuinely weakly-coupled scenario is the N = 4 theory. As we have emphasized in \u00a7IV.3, only the 8\nsupersymmetric and 8 superconformal zero modes are exact, the remaining 8kN \u2212 16 are lifted by in-\nteractions and consequently we expect the instanton effective action S\u02dc to depend on all the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates except (4.43) and (4.46). It is easily verified from (5.26) (using the fermionic\nADHM constraints (4.34)) that the latter sixteen variables decouple from S\u02dc as expected. There is an-\nother way to phrase this result. The decoupling of the supersymmetric and superconformal Grassmann\ncollective coordinates implies that the symplectic curvature of Mk admits four null eigenvectors:\nRijkl\u2113\ni = 0 . (5.49)\nThe fact that the symplectic curvature has four null eigenvectors implies that the holonomy group of\nMk is reduced from Sp(kN) to Sp(kN \u2212 2) (or for M\u0302k from Sp(kN \u2212 1) to Sp(kN \u2212 2)) [28, 52].\n32Actually this statement is not quite correct because we are taking a gauge group SU(N). However, the ADHM\nconstruction actually yields a U(N) gauge potential, where the abelian part of the gauge group is pure gauge: in this\nsense the statement is correct.\n73\nWhen VEVs are turned on, it is easy to see that the instanton effective action now lifts the super-\nconformal zero modes via the first term in (5.25), as one expects since conformal invariance is broken.\nOf course the supersymmetric zero modes remain unlifted because the introduction of VEVs does not\nbreak supersymmetry.\nV.3 The supersymmetric volume form on Mk\nIn this section, we show how to construct a volume form on the space of collective coordinates of a\nsupersymmetric instanton, generalizing the result (3.17) in the pure gauge theory. We shall adopt an\napproach based on the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction, but we shall find a result that is identical\nwith the original approach of Refs. [20,30,31] which relied on various consistency conditions, principally\nsupersymmetry and clustering, in order to construct the volume form.\nWe have already seen how the Grassmann collective coordinates arise in the context of the hyper-\nKa\u00a8hler quotient construction. The quantities {\u00b5, \u00b5\u00af,M\u2032\u03b1} can be arranged (4.35) as an n-vector Mi\u02dc\n(n = 2k(N+k)). The fermionic ADHM constraints are precisely the conditions forMi\u02dc to be a symplectic\ntangent vector to the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient space. Using this fact it straightforward to write down\nthe integration measure for the Grassmann collective coordinates. As for the volume form itself, the\nintegration measure on the quotient Mk is induced from that on the mother space M\u02dc. The covariant\nexpression for this latter quantity is \u222b \u220f2n\ni\u02dc=1 dMi\u02dc\nPfaff \u2126\u02dc\n, (5.50)\nwhere \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc is the anti-symmetric symplectic tensor on the mother space (2.68). We restrict to the\nquotient space by inserting explicit Grassmann-valued \u03b4-functions to impose the symplectic tangent\nvector condition (B.30). These \u03b4-functions must be accompanied by a suitable Jacobian giving\u222b \u220f2n\ni\u02dc=1 dMi\u02dc\nPfaff \u2126\u02dc\n1\nJf\ndimG\u220f\nr=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(Mi\u02dc\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r ) . (5.51)\nThe Jacobian Jf is related to the determinant of L, (2.124), the matrix of inner products of the normal\nvectors to the quotient space:33\nJf =\n\u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u2223 . (5.52)\nFor the particular quotient that yields the ADHM construction M\u02dc is flat, and Pfaff \u2126\u02dc is simply a\nnumerical factor and we can write the measure for each species of fermion as\u222b\nd2k(N+k)M \u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u2223\u22121 k2\u220f\nr=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrk T\nr(M\u00afa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M)\n)\n. (5.53)\nwhere34 \u222b\nd2k(N+k)M def=\n\u222b k2\u220f\nr=1\nd2(M\u2032)r\nk\u220f\ni=1\nN\u220f\nu=1\nd\u00b5\u00afiu d\u00b5ui . (5.54)\n33The following can be deduced from Eq. (5.79).\n34Our convention for integrating a two-component spinor \u03c8\u03b1 is\n\u222b\nd2\u03c8 \u2261 \u222b d\u03c81 d\u03c82.\n74\nPutting this together with volume form for Mk, (3.17), the collective coordinate volume form for an\narbitrary supersymmetric theory is\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ) =\nC(N )k\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k(N+k)a\nN\u220f\nA=1\nd2k(N+k)MA \u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u22231\u2212N\n\u00d7\nk2\u220f\nr=1\n{ 3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n2\ntrk T\nr(\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9)\n) N\u220f\nA=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrk T\nr(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA)\n)}\n.\n(5.55)\nThe normalization factor C(N )k can be determined by a careful analysis of the inner products of the zero\nmodes:\nC(N )k = 2\n\u2212k(k\u22121)\/2+kN(2\u2212N )\u03c02kN(1\u2212N ) . (5.56)\nAn independent check of the normalization constants C(N )k can be achieved, as in \u00a7III.2.1, by invoking\nthe clustering property of the instanton integration measure. In order to apply this argument we have\nto consider how the Grassmann integrals behave in the complete clustering limit. In this limit, the\noff-diagonal components of the fermionic ADHM constraints are dominated by the term\n(X\u00af i \u2212 X\u00afj)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1M\u2032\u03b1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (5.57)\nWe can therefore use the off-diagonal constraints to saturate the (M\u2032\u03b1)ij , i 6= j, integrals. This yields\na factor of \u220f\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)2 , (5.58)\nfor each species of fermion. However, each species of fermion is accompanied by a factor of |detk2L|\u22121\nwhich clusters as (3.24). Hence, what remains in the complete clustering limit are the diagonal fermionic\nADHM constraints which to leading order are the fermionic ADHM of the individual instantons. Hence,\ntaking into account the clustering of the purely bosonic parts of the volume form, as in \u00a7III.2.1, we find\nthat the supersymmetric measures clusters consistently.\nV.3.1 Supersymmetry\nIn this section, we will verify that the volume form Eq. (5.55) is invariant under the supersymmetry\ntransformations acting on the collective coordinates that we established in \u00a7IV.5.\nTo begin with, consider the supersymmetry variations of the bosonic and fermionic ADHM con-\nstraints, (2.65) and (4.34), since these appear as the argument of the \u03b4-functions in (5.55). First, the\nc-number ADHM constraints (2.65):\n\u03b4\n(\n~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9a\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b2\u02d9\n)\n= ~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9\n(\u2212 i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AM\u00afAa\u03b2\u02d9 + i\u03be\u00af\u03b2\u02d9Aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA) = \u2212i~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u03b1\u02d9A(M\u00afAa\u03b2\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9MA) . (5.59)\nIn other words, the bosonic ADHM constraints transform into a linear combination of the fermionic\nADHM constraints (4.34). Now the fermionic ADHM constraints themselves:\n\u03b4(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA\n)\n= 4i\u03beA\u03b1\n(\nb\u03b1a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1\n)\n+ i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B\n(M\u00afAMB \u2212 M\u00afBMA)+ 2i\u03be\u00af\u03b2\u02d9B\u03a3ABa (C\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9C\u03b2\u02d9a )\n= i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B\n(M\u00afAMB \u2212 M\u00afBMA \u2212 2\u03a3ABa w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 + 2\u03a3ABa L\u03d5a) .\n(5.60)\n75\nTo prove this, we used (2.54b) to show that first bracket on the right-hand side of (5.60) vanishes.\nGoing from the first line to the second line involved using the bosonic ADHM constraints (2.65) along\nwith the definition of L in Eq. (2.125). The final expression then vanishes by virtue of the definition of\n\u03d5a in Eq. (4.65) along with a \u03a3-matrix identity (A.20).\nThe fact that the variation of the bosonic (fermionic) ADHM constraints involves the fermionic\n(bosonic) ADHM constraints looks promising because it means that the variation of the product of\n\u03b4-functions in (5.55) vanishes to linear order. For the N = 1 measure, this is sufficient to prove\nsupersymmetric invariance. The reason is that the transformation of a\u03b1\u02d9 involves M but that ofM is a\nconstant. Hence, the super-Jacobian for the transformation of {a\u03b1\u02d9,M} vanishes at linear order. Since\nthere are no other contributions to consider, the N = 1 measure is a supersymmetric invariant.\nHowever, the story is more involved with extended supersymmetry. The reason is that, contrary to\nthe N = 1 case, the variation of the Grassmann collective coordinates (4.70) involves the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates through the dependence of C\u03b1\u02d9a and C\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a on \u03d5a, (4.71), which in turn depends on\nMA via (4.65). This means that at linear order there is non-trivial super-Jacobian for the transforma-\ntion of {a\u03b1\u02d9,MA}. In order to prove supersymmetric invariance, this super-Jacobian must cancel the\ntransformation of the remaining factor\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u22231\u2212N that we have not, hitherto, considered.\nRather than evaluate the variations of these two quantities, and then show that they cancel, we will\nproceed in more indirect fashion. The idea is to remove the dependence of \u03b4MA on the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates by introducing some auxiliary variables. The obvious candidate is \u03d5a itself. In\norder to implement this idea, we need to find out how \u03d5a transforms. We can answer this by considering\nthe variation of the definition (4.65). Writing this as\nL \u00b7 \u03d5a = 14 \u03a3\u00afaABM\u00afAMB + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 , (5.61)\nthe variation of the left-hand side is the sum of L \u00b7 \u03b4\u03d5a and\n(\u03b4L) \u00b7 \u03d5a = i2 \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\n({\n\u00b5\u00afAw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5A +M\u2032\u03b1Aa\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9M\u2032A, \u03d5a} \u2212 2M\u2032\u03b1A\u03d5aa\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 2a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5aM\u2032\u03b1A\n)\n= i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\n(\n\u00b5\u00afAw\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5a + [M\u2032\u03b1Aa\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9, \u03d5a]\u2212 \u03d5aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5A + [\u03d5a, a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9M\u2032\u03b1A]\n)\n,\n(5.62)\nusing the definition of L in (2.125). The last equality follows by using the fermionic ADHM constraints\n(4.34). For the variation of the right-hand side of (5.61), one finds\ni\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaBC\u03a3\nCA\nb \u03be\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\n(C\u00afb\u03b1\u02d9MB \u2212 M\u00afBCb\u03b1\u02d9)+ i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A(\u00b5\u00afA\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a\u00b5A) . (5.63)\nTaking the difference of (5.62) and (5.63), one deduces the variation of \u03d5a:\nL \u00b7 \u03b4\u03d5a = i\n{\n1\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaBC\u03a3\nCA\nb \u2212 \u03b4ab\u03b4AB\n}\n\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AFBb\u03b1\u02d9 , (5.64)\nwhere we have defined\nFBb\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(C\u00afb\u03b1\u02d9MB \u2212 M\u00afBCb\u03b1\u02d9) . (5.65)\nThis looks disappointing because the variation of \u03d5a seems to depend on itself via Cb\u03b1\u02d9 and C\u00afb\u03b1\u02d9. However,\nnotice that the variation of the Grassmann collective coordinates (4.70) actually depends not on \u03d5a\ndirectly but, more precisely, on the combination \u03a3ABa \u03d5a. From (5.64), we have\nL \u00b7 \u03b4(\u03a3ABa \u03d5a) = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9C(\u2212 \u03a3BCa FAa\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03a3ACa FBa\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u03a3ABa FCa\u03b1\u02d9) . (5.66)\n76\nNow for N = 2 supersymmetry, there is only a single independent quantity \u03a3ABa \u03d5a which we can take\nto be \u03d5 \u2261 \u03a312a \u03d5a = i\u03d51 + \u03d52. In this case the right-hand side of (5.66) vanishes identically; hence\n\u03b4\u03d5 = 0 . (5.67)\nWe now consider the extended set of variables {a\u03b1\u02d9,MA, \u03d5}, where the latter is subject to its own\n\u201cADHM constraint\u201d following from its definition (4.65):\nL \u00b7 \u03d5 = \u22121\n2\n(M\u00af1M2 \u2212 M\u00af2M1) + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9 , (5.68)\nwhere \u03c60 \u2261 \u03a312a \u03c60a. The N = 2 measure (5.55) can then be written in a suggestive way by replacing\nthe factor of |detk2 L|\u22121 with an integral over the auxiliary variable \u03d5 with an explicit \u03b4-function which\nimposes the new ADHM constraint (5.68):\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22121 = \u222b dk2\u03d5 k2\u220f\nr=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrkT\nr(L \u00b7 \u03d5+ 1\n2\nM\u00af1M2 \u2212 1\n2\nM\u00af2M1 \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9)\n)\n. (5.69)\nIt is then easy to see that, when re-written using the above identity, the new form of the measure is\nsupersymmetric. This follows because the variations of {a\u03b1\u02d9,MA, \u03d5} are either off-diagonal or vanish;\nhence, the super-Jacobian vanishes to linear order. To complete the proof, the variations of the ADHM\nconstraints, (2.65), (4.34) and (5.68) are also either off-diagonal or vanish,35 and so the variation of the\nproduct of \u03b4-functions also vanishes to linear order.\nFor N = 4 supersymmetry, we have to go back to (5.66) and follow the same logic. To make\nthings simpler, and ultimately without loss-of-generality, we can focus on particular a supersymmetry\nvariation, say \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d91 . In that case, the variation of the Grassmann collective coordinates (4.70) involves the\nthree quantities \u03d5A1 \u2261 \u03a3A1a \u03d5, A = 2, 3, 4. In that case, from (5.66), we have\nL \u00b7 \u03b4\u03d5A1 = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d91\n(\u2212 \u03a311a FAa\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03a3A1a F1a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u03a3A1a F 1a\u03b1\u02d9) = 0 . (5.70)\nThe new auxiliary variables \u03d5A1 are subject to their own \u201cADHM constraints\u201d:\nL \u00b7 \u03d5A1 = 1\n2\n(M\u00af1MA \u2212 M\u00afAM1)+ \u03a3A1a w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 . (5.71)\nSo for this particular supersymmetry variation, we consider the multiplet of variables {a\u03b1\u02d9,MA, \u03d5A1}.\nThe N = 4 collective coordinate integral (5.55) can then be re-cast by introducing integrals over the\nauxiliary variables \u03d5A1 along with explicit \u03b4-functions to impose (5.71):\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22123 = \u222b 4\u220f\nA=2\n{\ndk\n2\n\u03d5A1\nk2\u220f\nr=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrkT\nr(L \u00b7 \u03d5A1 \u2212 1\n2\nM\u00af1MA + 1\n2\nM\u00afAM1 \u2212 \u03a3A1a w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9)\n)}\n. (5.72)\nIt is then straightforward to prove, following the same logic as for N = 2, supersymmetric invariance.\nFirstly, the variations of {a\u03b1\u02d9,MA, \u03d5A1} are either off-diagonal or vanish; hence, the super-Jacobian\nvanishes to linear order. In addition, the variations of the ADHM constraints, (2.65), (4.34) and (5.71)\nare also off-diagonal or zero. Consequently, the variation of the product of \u03b4-functions also vanishes to\nlinear order. The new twist in the N = 4 case is, for each supersymmetry variation \u03be\u00afA, we must use a\ndifferent set of three auxiliary variables \u03a3ABa \u03d5a, B 6= A to prove supersymmetric invariance. Invariance\nof the measure (5.55) under a general supersymmetry variation then follows by linearity.\n35Note that the variation of (5.68) vanishes since we imposed it to find the variation of \u03d5a above.\n77\nV.4 From N = 4 to N = 0 via decoupling\nAn interesting consistency check on our collective coordinate integrals, Eq. (5.14) along with (5.55),\nwhich relates the expressions for different numbers of supersymmetries follows from renormalization\ngroup decoupling. The idea is to take one of the supersymmetric theories and add mass terms for some\nof the fields in such a way that for large masses the massive fields can be \u201cintegrated out\u201d and the theory\nflows in the infra-red to a theory with fewer supersymmetries. This procedure, when implemented at\nthe level of the semi-classical approximation, provides a way to relate the instanton integration measure\nfor different numbers of supersymmetries.\nWe begin, with the N = 2 theory, and give a mass to one of the two N = 1 chiral multiplets.\nAdding such mass terms is discussed in \u00a7VI.4. For a single flavour of fermion, the leading order effect,\nis to introduce (6.89)\nS\u02dcmass = m\n\u222b\nd4x trN \u03bb\n2 = \u2212m\u03c0\n2\ng\ntrk M\u00af(P\u221e + 1)M\u2261 \u2212m\n4g\n\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcMi\u02dcMj\u02dc , (5.73)\ninto the instanton effective action, where the inner product of two Grassmann symplectic tangent vectors\nwas defined in (4.38).\nThe integral over the Grassmann collective coordinatesM is written down in (5.53). It is convenient\nto re-write the argument of the fermionic ADHM constraints using (4.36) and then including the mass\nterm, we have\nI =\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22121 \u222b d2k(N+k)M k2\u220f\nr=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n4\u03c02\nMi\u02dc\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r\n)\nexp\n(m\n4g\n\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcMi\u02dcMj\u02dc\n)\n. (5.74)\nIn order to evaluate the integral it is useful to decompose\nMi\u02dc = \u03c3r\u03b1\u02d9X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r +M\u22a5 (5.75)\nwhere (M\u22a5)i\u02dc\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r = 0 for all r = 1, . . . , k and \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2. The quantity M\u22a5 is the projection of\nM which does not appear in the arguments of the \u03b4-functions and its integrals must be saturated\nby bringing down powers of the mass term. Hence with the decomposition (5.75), the integral (5.74)\nfactorizes as\nI =\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22121 \u222b \u220fk2r=1\u220f2\u03b1\u02d9=1 d\u03c3r\u03b1\u02d9 \u03b4( 14\u03c02\u03c3s\u03b2\u02d9X i\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9s \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r )\u2223\u2223\u2223det2k2 14\u03c02X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9s \u2223\u2223\u22231\/2 \u00b7\n\u222b\nd2kNM\u22a5 exp\n(m\n8g\n\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcM\u22a5i\u02dcM\u22a5j\u02dc\n)\n. (5.76)\nThe determinant in the denominator is the Jacobian for transforming to the variables \u03c3r\u03b1\u02d9. The Grass-\nmann integrals can now be done to give\nI =\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22121 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223det2k2 14\u03c02X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9s \u2223\u2223\u22231\/2 \u00b7 (2m\u03c02g )kN . (5.77)\n78\nThe second determinant factor can be related to a more familiar quantity by noting the following. From\nAppendix B, we established that on the level set of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient, the U(k)-vectors Xr\nsatisfy g\u02dc(Xr, I\u02dc\n(c)\nXs) = 0. In terms of components\n\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9X\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\nr \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX\nj\u02dc\u03b3\u02d9\ns ~\u03c4\n\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03b3\u02d9 = 0 implies X\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\nr \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX\nj\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\ns \u221d \u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 . (5.78)\nHence, from the definition of L is (2.124) and the explicit relation g\u02dc(Xr, Xs) = \u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9X\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\nr \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX\nj\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\ns , we have\u2223\u2223\u2223det2k2 14\u03c02X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9s \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223detk2 18\u03c02 12\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9r \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9s \u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2261 \u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u22232 . (5.79)\nConsequently, the two determinants in (5.77) cancel to leave a purely numerical factor\nI =\n(2m\u03c02\ng\n)kN\n. (5.80)\nUsing this expression for the integral (5.74), we find that after decoupling the N = 2 collective\ncoordinate integral gives the N = 1 collective coordinate integral with the following relation between\nthe Pauli-Villars mass scales:\n\u00b53NN=1 = m\nN\u00b52NN=2 , (5.81)\nAlternatively, we can phrase the result in terms of the renormalization group \u039b-parameters defined in\n(5.17):\n\u039bN=1 =\n(\ng2m\n)N\n\u039bN=2 . (5.82)\nTherefore, the decoupling limit is g2m\u2192\u221e and \u039bN=2 \u2192 0 in such a way that \u039bN=1 is fixed.\nNow we turn to the relation between the N = 4 and N = 2 theory. We start with the N = 4\ntheory and add an N = 2 preserving mass term for a pair of N = 1 chiral multiplets. This results in a\ncontribution (6.89) to the instanton effective action:\nS\u02dcmass = m\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n(\n\u03bb3\u03bb3 + \u03bb4\u03bb4\n)\n= \u2212m\u03c0\n2\ng\ntrk\n[M\u00af3(P\u221e + 1)M3 + M\u00af4(P\u221e + 1)M4] (5.83)\nWe can now integrate out the two flavours of Grassmann collective coordinates M3 and M4 as above\nto verify that the collective coordinate integrals are related if\n\u00b52NN=2 = m\n2N . (5.84)\nThis means that\n\u039bN=2 = m\n2Ne\u22128\u03c0\n2\/g2+i\u03b8 (5.85)\nand so the decoupling limit is m\u2192\u221e and g2 \u2192 0, in such a way that \u039bN=2 is fixed.\nWe remark that (5.82) and (5.85) are consistent with the standard prescriptions in the literature for\nthe renormalization group matching of a low-energy and a high-energy theory [53, 54]. The absence of\nnumerical factors on the right-hand side of these relations reflects the absence of threshold corrections\nin the Pauli-Villars scheme.\n79\nFinally, we can take the N = 1 theory and decouple the gluino to flow at low energies to the non-\nsupersymmetric theory. In this limit, the N = 1 collective coordinate integral gives the extrapolation\nof (5.55) to N = 0 with the relation\n\u00b54NN=0 = m\nN\u00b53NN=1 . (5.86)\nHowever, in the non-supersymmetric theory there is also a non-trivial fluctuation determinant described\nin \u00a7III.3 which is not, of course, reproduced.\n80\nVI Generalizations and Miscellany\nIn this section we describe some important generalizations of the instanton calculus and other results.\nIn \u00a7VI.1, we describe how the ADHM constraints can be solved when N \u2265 2k. This will be useful in\napplications where a large-N limit is involved, as in \u00a7VII and \u00a7IX. Then, in \u00a7VI.2, we explain how\nto generalize the instanton calculus to theories with gauge groups Sp(N) and SO(N). This is useful\nin the application to N = 2 theories described in \u00a7VIII involving gauge group SU(2) because it turns\nout that the instanton calculus of Sp(1) (\u2243 SU(2)) is actually more economical and convenient than\nthe SU(2)-as-an-example-of-SU(N) formalism developed previously. Moving on, in \u00a7VI.3, we describe\nhow to include matter fields in the calculus. This is important for the applications in \u00a7VII and \u00a7X.1.\nThe question of how to modify the instanton calculus when fields have masses is considered in \u00a7VI.4.\nFinally in \u00a7VI.5 we consider the instanton partition function in more detail. In particular we show how\nit can be \u201clinearized\u201d by introducing various auxiliary variables including Lagrange multipliers for the\nbosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints. We also show how the integrals over the overall position\ncoordinate and its superpartners can be separated out, leading to the notion of the centred instanton\npartition function.\nVI.1 Solving the ADHM constraints for N \u2265 2k\nIt turns out that when N \u2265 2k the ADHM constraints can be solved in a certain generic region of the\nmoduli space by a change of variables [21]. The idea is to introduce the gauge invariant U(N)-invariant\nbi-linears (\nW \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n)\nij\n= w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu wuj\u03b2\u02d9 (6.1)\nwhich can be incorporated into four k \u00d7 k matrices\nW 0 = tr2W, W\nc = tr2(\u03c4\ncW ) . (6.2)\nWhen N \u2265 2k, these variables are independent and the change of variables from the 4kN real variables\n{w\u03b1\u02d9, w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9}, to the bi-linear variables {W 0,W c} and the gauge orientation U (defined in \u00a7II.4.2) is invert-\nible, at least when the gauge orbit is generic as in Eq. (2.87). In changing variables, one must also, of\ncourse, specify the integration domain for the new variables. In particular, since the W variables are\nthe inner products of vectors they will be constrained by various triangle inequalities.36\nThe reason why this change of variables is useful, is because the ADHM constraints (2.65) are linear\nin W c; indeed they can be re-cast as\nW c = \u2212a\u2032ma\u2032ntr2\n(\n\u03c4 c\u03c3\u00afm\u03c3n\n)\n. (6.3)\nThe final description of the subspace of the moduli space on a generic orbit of the gauge group for\nN \u2265 2k is then in terms of the five k \u00d7 k Hermitian matrices, W 0 and a\u2032n, in addition to U. However,\n36Fortunately, these technicalities will not be relevant in our applications at large-N . In this case, steepest-descent\nmethods apply and the saddle-point values of the W \u2019s obtained in \u00a7IX and \u00a7VII satisfy all such triangle inequalities by\ninspection. In addition, we will show that on the saddle-points the k instantons inhabit k commuting SU(2) subgroups\nof the the gauge group. Hence, manifestly, they lie on a generic orbit of the gauge group (2.87).\n81\nas long as one is in a phase where the gauge symmetry is not broken then physical quantities are gauge\ninvariant and one can readily integrate over the gauge orientation U.\nIn order to exploit this linearizing change-of-variables, we must determine how the instanton inte-\ngration measure transforms in going from {w\u03b1\u02d9, w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9} to the bi-linears {W 0,W c} in Eq. (6.2) and the\ngauge orientation U. In what follows it will be useful to think of w\u03b1\u02d9 as an N \u00d7K-dimensional matrix\nw, where K = 2k, and to introduce the composite index a \u2261 i\u03b1\u02d9 = 1, . . . , K, so that the elements of w\nare wua. A suitable SU(N) gauge transformation U puts the matrix w into upper-triangular form, as in\n(2.83). The \u03beab are complex except for the diagonal elements \u03beaa which we can choose to be real. While\na priori the \u03beab are only defined for 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 K, it is convenient to extend them to 1 \u2264 b < a \u2264 K\nas well, by defining \u03beab = (\u03beba)\n\u2217. In terms of these extended variables, the gauge-invariant bi-linear W\ndefined in (6.1) is the matrix\nW = w\u2020w =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03be11 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n\u03be21 \u03be22\n...\n...\n...\n. . . 0\n\u03beK1 \u03beK2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03beKK\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03be11 \u03be21 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03beK1\n0 \u03be22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03beK2\n...\n. . .\n...\n0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 \u03beKK\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (6.4)\nNote that there are as many real degrees-of-freedom in the {Wab} as in the {\u03beab}. From Eq. (6.4) it\nfollows that\ndetKW =\n( K\u220f\na=1\n\u03beaa\n)2\n. (6.5)\nWhen calculating the Jacobian, it is useful to pass through an intermediate change-of-variables\ninvolving \u03be rather than the W . The Jacobian for this is\u222b\ndK\n2\nW = 2K\n\u222b\ndK\n2\n\u03be\nK\u220f\na=1\n\u03be2K\u22122a+1aa . (6.6)\nThis can be proved by induction. For K = 1 one has simply W11 = \u03be\n2\n11. From Eq. (6.4) we can also\neasily relate the Jacobian for K to that for K \u2212 1; one finds\n\u2202\n({Wab})\n\u2202\n({\u03beab})\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nK\n=\n\u2202WKK\n\u2202\u03beKK\n(K\u22121\u220f\na=1\n\u2202WaK\n\u2202\u03beaK\n\u2202WKa\n\u2202\u03beKa\n)\u2202({Wab})\n\u2202\n({\u03beab})\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nK\u22121\n= 2\u03beKK\n(K\u22121\u220f\na=1\n\u03be2aa\n)\u2202({Wab})\n\u2202\n({\u03beab})\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nK\u22121\n.\n(6.7)\nThe result (6.6) follows by induction.\nNext, we calculate the Jacobian for the change of variables from w to {\u03be,U}. To this end, define\nua \u2261 Uua to be the ath column of U, a = 1, . . . , K. Since U \u2282 SU(N)\n(u\u2020)a \u00b7 ub = \u03b4ab . (6.8)\nThe K N -vectors ua then provide the well-known parameterization of the coset (2.84) as a product\nof spheres [55]. To see this, u1 is a unit vector in an N -dimensional complex space and consequently\n82\nparameterizes S2N\u22121. The second vector u2 is also a unit vector, but one which is orthogonal to u1, and\nconsequently parameterizes S2N\u22123. Continuing this chain of argument, we see that the vectors {ua}\nparameterize the product of spheres\nSU(N)\nSU(N \u2212K) \u2243 S\n2N\u22121 \u00d7 S2N\u22123 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S2N\u22122K+1 . (6.9)\nFrom (2.83) we can read off the expansion of the elements of w in terms of the elements of the\nvectors ua:\nwua =\na\u2211\nb=1\n\u03bebau\nb\nu . (6.10)\nThe Jacobian can be determined through the following iterative process.

(6.11)\nHere d2N\u22121\u2126\u02c61 is the usual measure for the solid angles on S2N\u22121 parameterized by u1. Continuing the\nprocess on the next vector wu2 = \u03be12u\n1\nu + \u03be22u\n2\nu, we have\u222b N\u220f\nu=1\ndwu2dw\n\u2217\nu2 = 2\nN\u22121\n\u222b\nd\u03be12d\u03be\n\u2217\n12 \u03be\n2N\u22123\n22 d\u03be22 d\n2N\u22123\u2126\u02c62 .

(6.18)\nIn the expression (3.17) for volume form on Mk, the \u03b4-functions imposing the ADHM constraints\nsimply soak up the integrals over W c (giving rise to the numerical factor of 23k\n2\nfrom the 1\n2\n\u2019s in the\narguments of the \u03b4-functions) to leave\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 =\n23k\n2\nAk Ck\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k\n2\na\u2032 dk\n2\nW 0 d4k(N\u2212k)U\n\u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223N\u22122k . (6.19)\nThe simplifications for N \u2265 2k also extend to the Grassmann sector. The trick is to find a change\nof variables in the Grassmann sector which mirrors that which we have just described for the c-number\ncollective coordinates. To this end, let us identify the super-partners of the collective coordinates\nassociated to global gauge transformations on the instanton solution. Infinitesimally, the latter are the\nsubset of \u03b4w which preserve the gauge invariant variables W , i.e., which satisfy\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\u03b4wuj\u03b2\u02d9 + \u03b4w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\niuwuj\u03b2\u02d9 = 0 . (6.20)\nUnder a supersymmetry transformation (4.68) one has\n\u03b4wui\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\u00b5\nA\nui , \u03b4w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\niu = \u2212i\u00b5\u00afAiu\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A . (6.21)\nInserting Eq. (6.21) into Eq. (6.20) produces the gauge-invariant conditions\n\u03be\u00af\u03b2\u02d9Aw\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\niu\u00b5\nA\nuj + \u03be\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\u00b5\u00af\nA\niuwuj\u03b2\u02d9 = 0 (6.22)\nor equivalently,\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\u00b5\nA\nuj = 0 and \u00b5\u00af\nA\niuwuj\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (6.23)\nTo satisfy these constraints, it is convenient to decompose \u00b5A as follows:\n\u00b5Aiu = wuj\u03b1\u02d9(\u03b6\n\u03b1\u02d9A)ji + \u03bd\nA\niu, \u00b5\u00af\nA\niu = (\u03b6\u00af\nA\n\u03b1\u02d9 )ijw\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nju + \u03bd\u00af\nA\niu , (6.24)\nwhere \u03bdA lies in the orthogonal subspace to w:\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu\u03bd\nA\nuj = 0, \u03bd\u00af\nA\niuwuj\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (6.25)\nThe superpartners of the bosonic coset coordinates U are then precisely the variables {\u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA}.38 Notice\nin the case of a single instanton, the variables \u03b6\u00afA = \u03b6A are precisely the Grassmann collective coordinates\nassociated to superconformal transformations.\nWe now turn to the Grassmann part of the instanton measure (5.55). As explained above, the\nsuperpartners of the global gauge collective coordinates U are the Grassmann variables {\u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA} defined\n38It is worth mentioning that although the coset coordinates correspond to bosonic zero modes which are generated by\nLagrangian symmetries, this is not true of their Grassmann partners.\n84\nin Eqs. (6.24)-(6.25). Since these coordinates are orthogonal to the w\u00af and w vectors, respectively, it is\neasy to see from (4.31a) that they do not appear in the fermionic ADHM constraints. The Jacobian for\nthe change of variables from the original Grassmann coordinates {\u00b5A, \u00b5\u00afA} to {\u03b6A, \u03b6\u00afA, \u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA}, is, for\neach value of A,39\n\u2202\n({\u00b5A, \u00b5\u00afA})\n\u2202\n({\u03b6A, \u03b6\u00afA, \u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA}) = \u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223\u2212k . (6.26)\nAs in the bosonic sector, the change of variables allows us to integrate out the Grassmann-valued\n\u03b4-functions in the measure (5.55) trivially. The arguments of the \u03b4-functions are the fermionic ADHM\nconstraints which, in terms of the new variables, are (4.31a) are\n\u03b6\u00afA\n\u03b2\u02d9\nW \u03b2\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9 +W\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\u03b6\n\u03b2\u02d9A +\n[M\u2032\u03b1A, a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9] = 0 . (6.27)\nThese equations can be used to eliminate the 2k2 variables \u03b6\u00afA\u03b1\u02d9 , for each A. The relevant integral is\nsimply \u222b\nd2k\n2\n\u03b6\u00afA\nk2\u220f\nr=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrk T\nr(\u03b6\u00afA\n\u03b2\u02d9\nW \u03b2\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9 +W\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\u03b6\n\u03b2\u02d9A +\n[M\u2032\u03b1A, a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9])) = \u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223k. (6.28)\nNotice that the factor on the right-hand side conveniently cancels the Jacobian of (6.26).\nThe expression for the supersymmetric volume form on the instanton moduli space in the case\nN \u2265 2k is\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ) =\n23k\n2\nC(N )k Ak\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k\n2\na\u2032 dk\n2\nW 0 d4k(N\u2212k)U\nN\u220f\nA=1\n{\ndk(N\u22122k)\u03bdA dk(N\u22122k)\u03bd\u00afA d2k\n2\n\u03b6A d2k\n2M\u2032A\n}\n\u00d7 \u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u22231\u2212N \u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223N\u22122k .\n(6.29)\nThis expression for the measure is the starting point for two applications of the multi-instanton calculus\nat large N that we describe in \u00a7VII and \u00a7IX.\nVI.2 The ADHM construction for Sp(N) and SO(N)\nThe ADHM formalism [7] for constructing instanton solutions was adapted for dealing with any of\nthe classical gauge groups in the early instanton literature. The method adopted was to consider the\nconstruction for one of the series of classical groups, e.g. symplectic groups in Ref. [56] and orthogonal\ngroups in Ref. [57], and then embed the other two series in this series. Our approach will be no different,\nalthough we will start from the unitary series. The advantage of this is that all the previous formulae\nthat we have established in the SU(N) case can easily be adapted to describe the other gauge groups.\nIn order to construct instanton solutions for gauge theories with Sp(N) and SO(N) gauge groups\nwe use the embeddings40\nSp(N) \u2282 SU(2N) , SO(N) \u2282 SU(N) , (6.30)\n39We define the integrals over the k \u00d7 k matrices \u03b6\u03b1\u02d9A and \u03b6\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A with respect to the Hermitian basis T r introduced in\n\u00a7II.4.1.\n40For the orthogonal groups we restrict N \u2265 4.\n85\nto extract the ADHM formalism for these groups in terms of the SU(N) ADHM construction. The\nsurprising feature of the resulting formalism is that the auxiliary group, U(k) in the SU(N) case and\ndenoted generally as H(k) at instanton number k, is not in the same series as the gauge group G. Table\n6.1 shows the auxiliary groups and defines the quantities N \u2032 and k\u2032 allowing us to present a unified\ntreatment of Sp(N) and SO(N).\nG SU(N) Sp(N) SO(N)\nH(k) U(k) O(k) Sp(k)\nN \u2032 N 2N N\nk\u2032 k k 2k\nTable 6.1: Gauge and associated auxiliary groups\nTo describe the other classical groups we start with the theory with gauge group SU(N \u2032) at instanton\ninstanton number k\u2032. Instanton solutions in the Sp(N) and SO(N) theories follow by simply imposing\ncertain reality conditions on the ADHM construction of the SU(N \u2032) theory which ensures that the gauge\npotential lies in the appropriate sp(N) and so(N) subalgebra of su(N \u2032). In order to deal with both\nthe Sp(N) and SO(N) case at the same time it is useful to define the notion of a generalized transpose\noperation denoted t which acts either on gauge or instanton indices. Specifically, on Sp(n) group indices\nt acts as a symplectic transpose, i.e. on a column vector v, vt = vTJT , where J is 2n\u00d72n the symplectic\nmatrix\nJ =\n(\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n)\n; (6.31)\nwhile on O(n) group indices t is a conventional transpose t \u2261 T . The adjoint representations of\nboth groups are Hermitian t-anti-symmetric matrices and have dimensions n(2n + 1) and n(n \u2212 1)\/2,\nrespectively. Hermitian t-symmetric matrices correspond to the anti-symmetric representation of Sp(n),\nwith dimension n(2n\u2212 1) and the symmetric representation of SO(n), with dimensions n(n + 1)\/2.\nThe additional reality conditions on the ADHM variables are\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = \u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9(w\u03b2\u02d9)\nt , (a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)\nt = a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 . (6.32)\nThese reality conditions are only preserved by the subgroup H(k) \u2282 U(k\u2032) of the auxiliary symmetry\ngroup of the SU(N \u2032) theory. The matrices a\u2032n are Hermitian and, by (6.32), t-symmetric, i.e. real\nsymmetric in the case of auxiliary group O(k), and symplectic anti-symmetric in the case of auxiliary\ngroup Sp(k). It is easy to verify that the ADHM constraints (2.65) themselves are anti-Hermitian\nt-anti-symmetric, in other words H(k) adjoint-valued. It is straightforward to show that these reality\nconditions are precisely what is required to render the gauge field (2.49) t-anti-symmetric, in other\nwords to restrict it to an sp(N) and so(N) subalgebra of su(N \u2032), respectively.\nThe Grassmann collective coordinates are subject to a similar set of reality conditions:\n\u00b5\u00af = \u00b5t , (M\u2032\u03b1)t =M\u2032\u03b1 . (6.33)\n86\nSo M\u2032\u03b1 is t-symmetric. The fermionic ADHM constraints (4.34) are, like their bosonic counterparts\nt-anti-symmetric.41\nWe can now count the number of c-number and Grassmann collective coordinates. For both Sp(N)\nand SO(N) at instanton number k there are 4kN real independent w variables, taking into account\nthe reality conditions. The number of a\u2032n variables is 4 \u00d7 k(k + 1)\/2 and 4 \u00d7 k(2k \u2212 1), for Sp(N)\nand SO(N), respectively. The physical moduli space is then the space of these variables modulo the\nthree H(k)-valued ADHM constraints (2.65) and auxiliary H(k) symmetry. Hence the dimension of the\nphysical moduli space is 4k(N + 1) and 4k(N \u2212 2), for Sp(N) and SO(N), respectively. This agrees\nwith the counting via the Index Theorem. The counting of the Grassmann sector of the physical moduli\nspace goes as follows. There are 2kN real degrees-of-freedom in \u00b5 and 2\u00d7k(k+1)\/2 and 2\u00d7k(2k\u22121),\nin M\u2032\u03b1, for Sp(N) and SO(N), respectively. The ADHM constraints then impose 2 \u00d7 k(k \u2212 1)\/2 and\n2\u00d7 k(2k+1) conditions, for Sp(N) and SO(N), respectively. Hence there are 2k(N +1) and 2k(N \u2212 2)\nreal physical Grassmann collective coordinates for Sp(N) and SO(N), respectively. Again this agrees\nwith the counting via the Index Theorem.\nAs an example, consider the Sp(1) theory. Since Sp(1) \u2243 SU(2), this should have the same content\nas the SU(2) ADHM construction that we have described in \u00a7II.4; however, we will find that the Sp(1)\ndescription is more economical in that there are fewer ADHM variables subject to fewer constraints for a\ngiven instanton number. This makes the Sp(1) formalism particularly attractive in certain applications\n(for instance in \u00a7VIII). In this case, the reality conditions (6.32) are explicitly\nw\u2217ui\u03b1\u02d9 = \u01eb\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9Juvwui\u03b2\u02d9 , (a\n\u2032\nn)ij = (a\n\u2032\nn)ji . (6.34)\nGiven that a\u2032n are Hermitian, the second condition implies that a\n\u2032\nn are real symmetric k \u00d7 k matrices.\nWe now write the gauge group indices as \u03b1 = 1, 2 rather than u = 1, 2. In this case the first condition\nbecomes\nw\u2217i\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = \u01eb\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2wi\u03b2\u03b2\u02d9 . (6.35)\nThis means that wi are quaternions of the form (2.9), so wi\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 = win\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 for real win. The fact that the\ngauge indices are also labelled by \u03b1 means that the ADHM variable a\u03b1\u02d9 can be written as a quaternion:\na\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\nw\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\na\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (6.36)\nAt instanton number k, there are 2k(k+3) variables a\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 subject to 3k(k\u22121)\/2 ADHM constraints and\nk(k \u2212 1)\/2 symmetries to give the dimension of Mk as 8k. This compares with the SU(2) description,\nwhere there are 4k(k + 2) variables a\u03b1\u02d9 subject to 3k\n2 ADHM constraints and k2 symmetries. Clearly\nthe Sp(1) formalism is more economical. For example, at the one-instanton level there are no ADHM\nconstraints in the Sp(1) formalism compared with three in the SU(2) formalism.\nIn general all the formulae that we have established in the instanton calculus carry through to the\nSp(N) and SO(N) cases without change. The only difference is the ADHM variables are subject to the\nreality conditions (6.32) and (6.33). In particular, the collective coordinate integration measure and\nthe instanton effective action have the same form established in \u00a7V. Only the normalization constant\nfor the integral over the instanton moduli space C(N ) is changed.\n41In proving this it is useful to notice that (wt\u03b1\u02d9)\nt = \u2212w\u03b1\u02d9 and (\u00b5t)t = \u2212\u00b5.\n87\nVI.3 Matter fields and the ADHM construction\nIn this section we consider various aspects of the instanton calculus in supersymmetric theories with\nmatter fields. We will only consider matter in the fundamental representation of the gauge group\n(although the ADHM formalism can be extended to any higher representation by the tensor product\nformalism developed in [18]). There are two distinct applications: to N = 1 theories on the Higgs\nbranch and N = 2 theories on the Coulomb branch.\nVI.3.1 N = 1 theories on the Higgs branch\nLet us start by considering a theory with the N = 1 vector multiplet coupled to a a single fundamental\nchiral multiplet Q = (q, \u03c7), where q is the scalar (Higgs) field and \u03c7 is the Weyl fermion partner\n(Higgsino). The Euclidean space action for the matter fields (with no super-potential) is\nSmatter =\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\nDnq\u2020Dnq \u2212Dn\u03c7\u00af\u03c3\u00afn\u03c7\u2212\n\u221a\n2ig\u03c7\u00af\u03bb\u00afq +\n\u221a\n2igq\u2020\u03bb\u03c7+ 1\n4\ng2(q\u2020q)2\n}\n. (6.37)\nOn the Higgs branch, the scalar field will have an arbitrary VEV q0 and the instantons become con-\nstrained. As previously we can capture the leading-order behaviour in the semi-classical limit by an\nappropriate approximate instanton solution. As on the Coulomb branch of the N = 2 theories discussed\nin \u00a7IV.4, the anti-chiral fermions are zero for the approximate instanton: \u03bb\u00af = \u03c7\u00af = 0. To leading order,\ntherefore, the fundamental-valued chiral fermion \u03c7 satisfies the source free Weyl equation in the ADHM\ninstanton background\n\/\u00afD\u03c7 = 0 . (6.38)\nThe fundamental fermion zero modes were originally constructed in [18]. In our language, they read:\n\u03c7\u03b1 = g\n\u22121\/2U\u00afb\u03b1fK , (6.39)\nwhere Ki are k new Grassmann collective coordinates. In the case a fundamental fermion there are\nno analogues of the fermionic ADHM constraints for the new Grassmann coordinates K. So there are\nk independent zero modes which agrees with counting via the Index Theorem. The proof that (6.39)\nsatisfies (6.38) is a straightforward exercise in ADHM algebra, using (2.51), (C.19) and (C.2a):\n\/\u00afD\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1 =g\u22121\/2\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n\n(\n\u2202nU\u00af\u2206\u03b2\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9b\u03b1f + U\u00afb\u03b1\u2202nf\n)K\n=g\u22121\/2\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n U\u00af\n(\u2212 b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b2\u02d9b\u03b2\u03c3n\u03b2\u03b2\u02d9f \u2212 b\u03b2\u03c3n\u03b2\u03b2\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\u03b2\u02d9b\u03b1f)K = 0 . (6.40)\nOn the other hand, to leading order the Higgs field q satisfies an inhomogeneous covariant Laplace\nequation:\nD2q =\n\u221a\n2ig\u03bb\u03c7 (6.41)\ntogether with the VEV boundary conditions\nq\nx\u2192\u221e\n= q0 , (6.42)\n88\nwhere q0 = (q01, . . . , q\n0\nN) denotes the fundamental VEV. The right-hand side of Eq. (6.41) is the product\nof the classical configurations (4.29) and (6.39), respectively. The general solution to Eqs. (6.41)-(6.42)\nis\nq = U\u00af\n(\nq0\n[N]\n0[2k]\n)\n\u2212 i\n2\n\u221a\n2\nU\u00afMfK . (6.43)\nThe proof is another straightforward exercise in ADHM algebra (very similar to that in Appendix C\nEq. (C.25)). Firstly, similar to (C.3b),\nD2(U\u00afJ ) = \u22124U\u00afb\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b1J + U\u00af\u22022J \u2212 2U\u00afb\u03b1f\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2202nJ . (6.44)\nNow take J = \u2212 i\n4\nMfK and compare with\ng\u03bb\u03c7 = U\u00af\n(Mf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1fM\u00af)Pb\u03b1fK . (6.45)\nUsing the differentiation formulae (C.2b) and (C.2a) along with \u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M = \u2212M\u00af\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 and b\u00af\u03b1M = M\u00afb\u03b1,\none finds that the 2nd term in (6.44) matches the 1st term in (6.45), while the sum of the 1st and 3rd\nterms in (6.44) matches the 2nd term in (6.45).\nAs usual in the supersymmetric instanton calculus, q\u2020 ceases to be the conjugate of q in the instanton\nbackground, since it satisfies D2q\u2020 = 0 to leading order. Consequently\nq\u2020 =\n(\n(q0)\u2020[N] 0[2k]\n)\nU . (6.46)\nNotice that q\u2020 fails to be the conjugate of q due to the presence of terms bi-linear in the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates in the latter. This is a\u2014by now familiar\u2014symptom of working in Euclidean\nspace.\nTo capture the leading order behaviour we have to take the approximate instanton solution, including\nthe matter field solutions discussed above, and substitute them into the Euclidean action. The gauge\nfield term in the component Lagrangian yields \u22122\u03c0i\u03c4 as always. Following the method of Refs. [48,58],\nthe two other relevant terms of the action, namely the Higgs kinetic term and the Yukawa interaction\ninvolving the chiral fermions are turned into a surface term with an integration by parts in the former\ntogether with the Euler-Lagrange equation (6.41) for the fundamental scalar:\nS\u02dc =\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\nDnq\u2020Dnq + i\n\u221a\n2q\u2020\u03bb\u03c7\n}\n=\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\n\u2202n\n(\nq\u2020Dnq\n)\n+ q\u2020\n(\u2212D2q +\u221a2ig\u03bb\u03c7)} . (6.47)\nUsing Gauss\u2019s Theorem, the contribution to the action may then be extracted from the asymptotic\nfall-off at infinity\nxn\nx\nDnq x\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 1\n2x3\n(\nw\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9q0 + i\u221a\n2\n\u00b5K\n)\n(6.48)\nand hence to lowest order the instanton effective action is\nS\u02dc = \u03c02\n{\n(q0)\u2020w\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 q0 + i\u221a2(q\n0)\u2020\u00b5K\n}\n. (6.49)\nThis k-instanton formula, although written in ADHM collective coordinates, is nevertheless easily com-\npared with the one-instanton expression for the action with SU(2) gauge symmetry found in Ref. [38].\nThe first term in parentheses is equivalent to\n\u2211\ni |q0|2 \u03c12i , summed over the k different instantons, where\n89\n\u03c1i is the scale size of the i\nth instanton. Also the second term in parentheses is the fermion bi-linear\nnecessary to promote this \u03c12i to the supersymmetric invariant scale size constructed in [38]. Indepen-\ndent of one\u2019s choice of collective coordinates, the presence of the VEV in the instanton effective action\n(6.49) gives a natural cut-off to the integrations over instanton scale sizes [2], leading to an infrared-safe\napplication of instanton calculus.\nThe expressions given above may be immediately extended to phenomenologically more interesting\nmodels with NF fundamental flavors of Dirac fermions (known as a hypermultiplet). In this case the\ngauge multiplet is minimally coupled to 2NF chiral superfields Qf and Q\u02dcf , 1 \u2264 f \u2264 NF , where Qf\ntransforms in the N and Q\u02dcf in the N\u00af representation of the gauge group. We will take Q (Q\u02dc) to be an\nN \u00d7NF (NF \u00d7N), but for greater clarity we will often write the flavour indices explicitly. The action\nfor the matter fields is\nSmatter =\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\nDnq\u2020Dnq +Dnq\u02dcDnq\u02dc\u2020 \u2212Dn\u03c7\u00af\u03c3\u00afn\u03c7 + \u03c7\u02dc\u03c3nDn \u00af\u02dc\u03c7\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2ig\u03c7\u00af\u03bb\u00afq + i\n\u221a\n2q\u2020\u03bb\u03c7+\n\u221a\n2igq\u02dc\u03bb\u00af \u00af\u02dc\u03c7\u2212\n\u221a\n2ig\u03c7\u02dc\u03bbq\u02dc\u2020 + 1\n4\ng2(q\u2020q \u2212 q\u02dcq\u02dc\u2020)2\n}\n.\n(6.50)\nThe classical moduli space of the theory in the Higgs phase is given by [59, 60]:\nq0uf =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nv1 0 . . . 0\n0 v2 . . . 0\n...\n...\n. . .\n...\n0 0 . . . vf\n...\n...\n. . .\n...\n0 0 . . . 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n, q\u02dc0fu =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nv\u02dc1 0 . . . 0 . . . 0\n0 v\u02dc2 . . . 0 . . . 0\n...\n...\n. . .\n...\n. . .\n...\n0 0 . . . v\u02dcf . . . 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .

(6.55)\n42Here, and in the following, one should not confuse the flavour subscript f with the ADHM quantity f .\n90\nThe N = 1 supersymmetry transformation properties of the ADHM variables were constructed in \u00a7IV.5.\nTo check the invariance of the expression (6.55), it is necessary as well to derive the transformation prop-\nerties for the Grassmann collective coordinates K and K\u02dc associated with the fundamental fermions. As\nwith the other collective coordinates, this may be straightforwardly accomplished by equating \u201cactive\u201d\nand \u201cpassive\u201d supersymmetry transformations on the Higgsinos \u03c7 and \u03c7\u02dc. In this way one obtains:\n\u03b4Kf = \u22122\n\u221a\n2\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9q0f , \u03b4K\u02dcf = \u22122\n\u221a\n2q\u02dc0fw\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 . (6.56)\nIt is now easily checked that the action (6.55) is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations\n(4.68), (4.70) and (6.56).\nIt remains to determine how one integrates over the new Grassmann collective coordinates in the\nsemi-classical approximation of the functional integral. As for the adjoint-valued fields, the non-zero\nmode fluctuation determinants cancel, up to a power of the Pauli-Villars mass scale \u00b5\u22122kNF . The\nmeasure for integrating over the matter zero modes follows from the inner-product formula\u222b\nd4x\nNF\u2211\nf=1\n\u03c7\u02dcf\u03c7f = g\n\u22121\n\u222b\nd4x\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nK\u02dcff b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1Kf = \u2212 1\n4g\n\u222b\nd4x\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nK\u02dcf \u0003 fKf = \u03c0\n2\ng\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nK\u02dcfKf , (6.57)\nemploying (C.2b). The integration measure for the matter Grassmann collective coordinates is then\n\u03c0\u22122kNF\u00b5\u2212kNF gkNF\n\u222b\ndkNFK dkNF K\u02dc . (6.58)\nFor convenience, we define the combination\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ,NF ) = \u03c0\u22122kNF\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ) \u00b7 dkNFK dkNF K\u02dc (6.59)\nand then a generalization of the instanton partition function (5.16)\nZ\n(N ,NF )\nk =\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ,NF )e\u2212S\u02dc (6.60)\nto include the matter fields.\nWe will see that the N = 1 action (6.55) possesses two simplifying properties that the N = 2\naction, to be discussed below, does not. First, Eq. (6.55) has the form of a disconnected sum of k single\ninstantons; with the choice of these ADHM coordinates there is no interaction between them. Second,\nthe only gaugino modes that are lifted (i.e., that appear in the action) are those associated with the top\nelements \u00b5 and \u00b5\u00af of the collective coordinate matrices M and M\u00af. This leaves O(k) unlifted gaugino\nmodes after one implements the fermionic constraints (4.34). This counting contrasts sharply with\nthe N = 2 theories in which the number of unlifted modes is independent of the winding number k.\nSaturating each of these unlifted modes with an anti-Higgsino as per Affleck, Dine and Seiberg [50] one\nsees that unlike the N = 2 theory, here the sectors of different topological number cannot interfere with\none another, since the corresponding Green\u2019s functions are distinguished by different (anti-)fermion\ncontent.\n91\nVI.3.2 N = 2 theories on the Coulomb branch\nNow we consider N = 2 theories with NF flavors of fundamental hypermultiplets. Each such hypermul-\ntiplet comprises a pair of N = 1 chiral multiplets, Qf and Q\u02dcf , with the same conventions for component\nfields as in the N = 1 case discussed in the last section. In N = 1 language, these matter fields couple\nto the gauge multiplet via a superpotential,\nW =\n\u221a\n2g\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nQ\u02dcf\u03a6Qf .

The classical component fields \u03c7f , \u03c7\u02dcf , qf and q\u02dcf are still\ngiven by Eqs. (6.53)-(6.54), except that on the Coulomb branch the first terms on the right-hand sides\nof Eq. (6.54) are zero. The adjoint-valued fermions have their usual ADHM form \u03bb = g\u22121\/2\u039b(M1) and\n\u03c8 = g\u22121\/2\u039b(M2). To leading order, the scalar field \u03c6 satisfies the same equation-of-motion as in the\npure N = 2 gauge theory and so the solution follows from Eqs. (4.64) and (4.65) (along with definition\nof \u03c6 in (4.20)):43\n\u03c6 = i\n2\nU\u00afMAfM\u00afAU + U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d51[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\nU , (6.63)\nwhere\n\u03d5 = L\u22121\n(\n\u2212 i\n2\nM\u00afAMA + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n.

(6.65)\nThe solution of this equation is readily shown to be\n\u03c6\u2020 = U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60\u2020 0\n0 \u03d5\u20201[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\nU , (6.66)\nwhere\n\u03d5\u2020 = L\u22121\n(\n\u2212 1\n4\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nKf K\u02dcf + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60\u2020w\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (6.67)\n43In the following when discussing the N = 2 theory, we use the \u01eb tensor to raise and lower SU(2) R-symmetry spinor\nindices in the usual way following the conventions of [47].\n92\nNow we consider the matter fields themselves.

(6.76)\n44As usual, to leading order where we set the anti-chiral fermions to zero and ignore the potential terms for the scalar\nfields.\n93\nFirst of all, using (2.51), the left-hand side of (6.74) is\ng1\/2\n(\u221a\n2i\u03bbq\u02dc\u2020 +\n\u221a\n2\u03c8q + \u03c6\u03c7\n)\n= i\n2\nU\u00af\n{\nMAfb\u03b1PMA \u2212 b\u03b1fM\u00afAPMA\n+MAfM\u00afAPb\u03b1\n}\nfKf + U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d5\n)\nPb\u03b1fKf .\n(6.77)\nThen using the formula\nD\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9(U\u00afJ ) = U\u00af\u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9J \u2212 2U\u00afb\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9J , (6.78)\nwe have\n\/D\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03a5\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = i2\u01ebABU\u00af\n{\nb\u03b1fM\u00afA(1\u2212P)MA +MAf b\u00af\u03b1PMA +MAfM\u00afAPb\u03b1\n}\nfKf\n+ U\u00af\n{(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d5\n)\n(P \u2212 1)b\u03b1 + b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d5\n)\n\u2206\u03b1\u02d9\n}\nfKf .\n(6.79)\nIn the last term we can now use the identity (C.32), along with the expression for \u03d5 in (6.64):\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d5\n)\n\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2212 i2M\u00afAMA + {\u03d5, f\u22121} . (6.80)\nThis simplifies (6.79)\n\/D\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03a5\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = i2U\u00af\n{\n\u2212 b\u03b1fM\u00afAPMA +MAf b\u00af\u03b1PMA +MAfM\u00afAPb\u03b1\n}\nfKf\n+ U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d5\n)\nPb\u03b1fKf + U\u00afb\u03b1f\u03d5Kf .\n(6.81)\nNow one can see that apart from the last term, which is the fundamental zero mode \u0398, this is precisely\n(6.77). So the contribution to S\u02dc from the Yukawa terms is given by\n\u2212g1\/2\n\u222b\nd4x \u03c7\u02dc\u0398 , (6.82)\nwhich can be evaluated using the inner-product formula (6.57):\n\u2212\u03c02\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nK\u02dcf\u03d5Kf = \u03c0\n2\ng2\ntrk\n[( NF\u2211\nf=1\nKfK\u02dcf\n)\nL\n\u22121(\u2212 i\n2\nM\u00afAMA + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9\n)]\n. (6.83)\nSumming the result with (6.73) gives the leading order expression for the instanton effective action:\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02trk\n{\n\u2212 i\n2\n\u00b5\u00afA\u03c60\u2020\u00b5A + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2223\u2223\u03c60\u2223\u22232w\u03b1\u02d9\n+\n(\n1\n4\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nKfK\u02dcf \u2212 w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60\u2020w\u03b1\u02d9\n)\nL\n\u22121\n(\n\u2212 i\n2\nM\u00afAMA + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9\n)}\n.\n(6.84)\nAs with the N = 1 action (6.55), one can check that this expression is a supersymmetric invariant.\nNotice on the Coulomb branch, Eq. (6.56) collapses to\n\u03b4Kf = \u03b4K\u02dcf = 0 . (6.85)\nWe can also add N = 2 preserving masses for the hypermultiplets as explained in \u00a7VI.4 below.\nFinally, the collective coordinate integration measure for the Grassmann collective coordinates is given\nby the same expression, Eq. (6.58), as in the N = 1 theory.\n94\nVI.4 Masses\nIn certain circumstances one wants to add masses for some of the fields. Here we assess the affects\non the instanton calculus. It turns out that the effect will be simple to incorporate when working to\nleading order in the semi-classical approximation.\nThe interesting cases involve N = 1 preserving mass terms in either N = 2 or N = 4 theories. The\nsimplest case consists of a mass term for a fundamental hypermultiplet transforming in the (N , N\u00af) as\ndescribed in \u00a7VI.3. When Wick rotated to Euclidean space, the conventional mass term in components\nis\nSmass =\n\u222b\nd4x\n{\nm\u03c7\u02dc\u03c7+m\u2217\u03c7\u00af \u00af\u02dc\u03c7 + 2|m|2q\u2020q + 2|m|2q\u02dcq\u02dc\u2020\n}\n. (6.86)\nIn principle, these mass terms contribute new terms to the equations-of-motion which will affect the\ninstanton solutions themselves. In applications one is typically interested quantities that are known\nto have holomorphic dependence on the mass. We then expect that the semi-classical approximation\nrespects this dependence.45 Hence for a holomorphic quantity, we can treat m and m\u2217 as independent\nvariables and then setm\u2217 = 0. The mass terms then only affect the equations-of-motion of the anti-chiral\nfermions \u03c7\u00af and \u00af\u02dc\u03c7 and the supersymmetric instanton remains unaffected to leading order. Hence, we\nsimply have to evaluate the first term in Eq. (6.86) in the background of the supersymmetric instanton\nand add the resulting expression to the instanton effective action S\u02dc. The contribution can be determined\nusing the inner-product formula (6.57). For NF such hypermultiplets\nS\u02dcmass =\n\u03c02\ng\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nmf K\u02dcfKf . (6.87)\nNow we turn to masses for adjoint chiral superfields. As discussed above only the mass term for the\nchiral fermions is relevant. In the N = 4 theory the most general mass term for the chiral fermions is\nof the form\nSmass =\n\u222b\nd4xmABtrN \u03bb\nA\u03bbB . (6.88)\nwhere mAB is a symmetric matrix which in a suitable basis is diagonal mAB = diag(m1, m2, m3, m4). In\nthe general case, all the supersymmetry is broken, while if one, respectively two, of the eigenvalues vanish\nthen the coupling arise from mass terms that preserve N = 1, respectively N = 2, supersymmetry. To\nfind the effect on the instanton effective action we substitute the ADHM form \u03bbA = g\u22121\/2\u039b(MA) and\nevaluate the integral using Corrigan\u2019s inner-product formula (4.37):\nS\u02dcmass = \u2212mAB\u03c0\n2\ng\ntrk M\u00afA(P\u221e + 1)MB = \u2212mAB\u03c0\n2\ng\ntrk\n[\n2\u00b5\u00afA\u00b5B +M\u2032\u03b1AM\u2032B\u03b1\n]\n. (6.89)\n45It should be possible to prove this by showing that the relevant Ward identity is respected. Such a proof would follow\nthe lines of \u00a7VII.1 which considers a different Ward identity.\n95\nVI.5 The instanton partition function\nFor many applications and for later conceptual developments it is useful to re-formulate the collective\ncoordinate integral, or instanton partition function (5.16), by introducing some auxiliary variables which\nhave the effect of the \u201clinearizing\u201d problem in a sense to be described. To start with one introduces\nLagrange multipliers for the bosonic and fermionic ADHM \u03b4-function constraints and also, for N > 1,\nother additional auxiliary variables. In Chapter X we will see for N > 1 this linearized form of\nthe collective coordinate integral has an important relation to higher-dimensional field theories. This\npoint-of-view will also be the starting point for understanding the relation of the instanton calculus to\nD-branes in string theory as described in \u00a7X.3.\nIn the linearized formalism one introduces auxiliary variables in the form of: \u03c7a a 2(N \u22121)-vector of\nHermitian k\u00d7 k matrices; ~D, a 3-vector of Hermitian k\u00d7 k matrices; and k\u00d7 k matrices of Grassmann\nsuperpartners \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A, A = 1, . . . ,N . The instanton partition function (5.16) can be written as\nZ\n(N )\nk =\n22(2\u2212N )k\n2\n\u03c0(2\u22123N )k\n2\nC(N )k\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k(N+k)a d3k\n2\nD d2(N\u22121)k\n2\n\u03c7\nN\u220f\nA=1\nd2k(N+k)MA d2k2\u03c8\u00afA e\u2212S\u02dc , (6.90)\nwhere the instanton effective action is\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02trk\n{\n\u03c7aL\u03c7a +\n1\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaABMAMB\u03c7a\n}\n+ S\u02dcL.m. , (6.91)\nwhere\nS\u02dcL.m. = \u22124i\u03c02trk\n{\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\n(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA)+ ~D \u00b7 ~\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9} . (6.92)\nThe previous form of the collective coordinate integral (5.55) is recovered by integrating out the auxiliary\nvariables {\u03c7a, ~D, \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A}. Specifically, integrating out the Lagrange multipliers ~D and \u03c8\u00afA yield the \u03b4-\nfunctions in (5.55) imposing the ADHM constraints and their Grassmann analogues, (2.65) and (4.34).\nThe Gaussian integrals over \u03c7a yield the appropriate power of detk2L in (5.55) as well as the quadrilinear\ncouplings of Grassmann collective coordinates of the N = 4 theory (5.26).\nOne of the advantages of the linearized form of the partition function is that it is straightforward\nto incorporate scalar VEVs on the Coulomb branch in the N = 2 and N = 4 theories. One simply\ngeneralizes the following couplings in the instanton effective action S\u02dc:\nw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a \u2192 w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a + \u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 , \u03c7aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 \u03c7aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a ,\n\u00b5A\u03c7a \u2192 \u00b5A\u03c7a + \u03c60a\u00b5A , \u03c7a\u00b5\u00afA \u2192 \u03c7a\u00b5\u00afA + \u00b5\u00afA\u03c60a .\n(6.93)\nThe effective instanton action is now explicitly\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02trk\n{ \u2223\u2223w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a+\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\u2223\u22232\u2212 [\u03c7a, a\u2032n]2+ 12 \u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afA(\u00b5B\u03c7a+\u03c60a\u00b5B)+ 12\u03a3\u00afaABM\u2032AM\u2032B\u03c7a}+ S\u02dcL.m. , (6.94)\nwhere we used the definition of L in (2.125).

(6.95d)\n96\nOn integrating out the auxiliary variables {\u03c7a, ~D, \u03c8\u00afA}, these transformations reduce to those constructed\nin \u00a7IV.5.\nIn the N = 2 theory it rather simple to incorporate fundamental hypermultiplets. The instanton\neffective action, generalizing (6.94), is\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02trk\n{ \u2223\u2223w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a + \u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9\u2223\u22232 \u2212 [\u03c7a, a\u2032n]2 + i2 \u00b5\u00afA(\u00b5A\u03c7\u2020 + \u03c60\u2020\u00b5A)\n+ i\n2\nM\u2032AM\u2032A\u03c7\u2020 + 14\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nKfK\u02dcf (\u03c7\u2212 g\u22121mf )\n}\n+ S\u02dcL.m. ,\n(6.96)\nwhere we have defined\n\u03c60 = \u03c601 \u2212 i\u03c602 , \u03c7 = \u03c71 \u2212 i\u03c72 (6.97)\nand we have allowed for arbitrary hypermultiplet masses (6.87). Integrating out \u03c7a gives the instanton\neffective action (6.84). The supersymmetry transformations (6.95a)-(6.95d) are then augmented with\n(6.85).\nIn applications of the instanton calculus it is useful to define the notion of the \u201ccentred instanton\npartition function\u201d. This is defined in terms of an integral over the centred instanton moduli space\nM\u0302k, (2.16), where the overall position coordinates and their superpartners, the Grassmann collective\ncoordinates for the supersymmetries broken by the bosonic instanton solution (see \u00a7IV.2.3),\nXn = \u2212k\u22121trk a\u2032n , \u03beA = i4k\u22121trkM\u2032A , (6.98)\nhave been factored off. First of all, from the expression for the metric (2.66) we have\nds2Mk = 8\u03c0\n2k dXn dXn + ds\n2\nM\u0302k\n. (6.99)\nTherefore taking account of the normalization of the measure in the non-supersymmetric theory (3.16),\nwe have \u222b\nMk\n\u03c9 =\n\u222b\n(4\u03c0k)2d4X \u00b7\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9 . (6.100)\nNow we consider the supersymmetric integral. The inner-product of the supersymmetric zero modes\n(4.43) is from (4.37) \u222b\nd4x trN \u039b(\u22124i\u03beA1[k]\u00d7[k])\u039b(\u22124i\u03beB1[k]\u00d7[k]) = 16\u03c02k \u03beA\u03beB . (6.101)\nThis means \u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N ,NF ) =\n\u222b\n(4\u03c0k)2d4X\nN\u220f\nA=1\n(32\u03c02k)\u22121 d2\u03beA \u00b7\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N ,NF ) . (6.102)\nSince the instanton effective action is always independent of Xn and \u03be\nA, we can define the centred\ninstanton partition function, generalizing (6.60) as\nZ\u0302\n(N ,NF )\nk =\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N ,NF )e\u2212S\u02dc . (6.103)\n97\nVII The Gluino Condensate in N = 1 Theories\nPure N = 1 gauge theory is in some respects the simplest supersymmetric gauge theory; however, a\npuzzle arose in the mid-1980\u2019s over the numerical value of the gluino condensate. In this section, we\nwill describe how the puzzle\u2014described in detail below\u2014can be resolved using the calculus of many\ninstantons and, in particular, by exploiting the simplifications that occur in the large-N limit.\nIt is well established that N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory has N physically equivalent vacua,\nas dictated by the Witten Index, which differ by the phase of the gluino condensate. By dimensional\nanalysis one expects \u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= c \u039b3e2\u03c0iu\/N , u = 1, . . . , N , (7.1)\nwhere \u039b is the dynamical scale in the theory while c is a numerical constant. In particular, by a\npowerful supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem there can be no perturbative corrections to the\nform (7.1) since this would be a series in g and hence would not be holomorphic in \u039b.46 This suggests\nthat if c can be calculated to leading semi-classical order then it will be exact. Remarkably, there\nare two approaches in the literature for calculating the gluino condensate each superficially appearing\nto be exact but which differ in their predictions of the constant c. This disagreement is especially\nvexing in light of the fact that both involve the use of a single supersymmetric instanton. The first, we\nshall call the \u201cstrong-coupling instanton\u201d (SCI) approach [10, 38, 62\u201364], while the second, we call the\n\u201cweak-coupling instanton\u201d (WCI) approach [50, 64\u201366].\nIn the SCI approach one calculates the instanton contributions to the correlation functions of g2trN\u03bb\n2\ndirectly in the strongly-coupled confining phase of the theory. Strictly speaking, it is therefore not a\nsemi-classical calculation even though it uses instantons and ultimately we will conclude that this is\nwhy the SCI approach is flawed. In an instanton background, each insertion of g2trN\u03bb\n2 is quadratic in\nthe Grassmann collective coordinates and since the charge-k instanton has 2kN fermion zero modes,\nthe latter can only contribute to the kN -point function.47 Furthermore, by a Ward identity, which\nwe prove in \u00a7VII.1 is respected in the instanton approximation, the kN -point correlation function is\nindependent of the kN spacetime insertion points {x(i)}. The one-instanton calculation of the N -point\nfunction, reviewed in \u00a7VII.2.1, can be done exactly and yields the result\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(N))\n\u232a\n=\n2N\n(N \u2212 1)! (3N \u2212 1) \u039b\n3N . (7.2)\nIn order to extract\n\u2329\ng2trN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\nfrom the correlator (7.2), one then invokes cluster decomposition: taking\n|x(i) \u2212 x(j)| \u226b \u039b\u22121, and remembering the independence of the correlator on {x(i)}, one simply replaces\nthe left-hand side of Eq. (7.2) by\n\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232aN\n. Taking the N th root, the net result, based on this\none-instanton calculation, reads:\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\nSCI\n=\n2[\n(N \u2212 1)! (3N \u2212 1)]1\/N \u039b3 e2\u03c0iu\/N , (7.3)\n46In this context, \u039b is a complex quantity carrying with it the phase ei\u03b8\/3N .\n47This can also be deduced from the relation between \u039b and the running coupling (5.17) \u039b3N \u223c e2pii\u03c4(\u00b5).\n98\nwhere u = 1, . . . , N indexes the N vacua of the SU(N) theory, and reflects the ambiguity in taking the\nN th root. In retrospect\u2014as argued in Refs. [10, 63]\u2014the reason why the na\u00a8\u0131ve instanton calculation of\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\ngives zero is that the N vacua are being averaged over with equal weight in the instanton\napproximation and the phases cancel.48\nIn contrast, in the WCI approach, one modifies the pure gauge theory by adding matter superfields\nin such a way that the gauge symmetry is either entirely broken, or only an abelian subgroup remains,\nafter the Higgs mechanism. In this way the theory can be rendered weakly coupled in the infra-\nred and semi-classical approaches should be reliable. Here, we choose the former option by adding\nNF = N \u2212 1 matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In the\nHiggs phase, all the n-point functions of g2trN\u03bb\n2 receive contributions from constrained instantons.\nIn particular, based on fermion zero-mode counting, k-instantons now contribute uniquely to the k-\npoint function. We will argue in \u00a7VII.1 that, just as for the SCI approach, the supersymmetric Ward\nidentity guaranteeing independence of the result on the insertion points, is respected in the instanton\napproximation. In particular, the one instanton contribution to the one-point function can be performed\nexactly, as reviewed in \u00a7VII.2.2. The non-renormalization theorems of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory then permit the analytic continuation of the answer into the confining phase by decoupling\nthe extraneous matter fields. This is achieved by giving them a mass m, and taking the joint limit\nm \u2192 \u221e and \u039b(NF ) \u2192 0 in the manner dictated by renormalization group decoupling. Matching the\nexact one-instanton calculation onto the effective low-energy theory without matter gives:\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\nWCI\n= \u039b3e2\u03c0iu\/N . (7.4)\nNote that the renormalization group decoupling procedure forces the low-energy theory into one of the\nN degenerate vacua. The puzzle now reveals itself as the mismatch between (7.3) and (7.4).\nIn this Chapter, following Ref. [67], we review this old controversy, using the many-instanton calculus\nthat we have developed in previous sections. In particular, we shall calculate the k-instanton contribu-\ntion to the kN -point correlator, in the SCI approach, and the k-point function, in the WCI approach,\nin the large-N limit where the solution of the ADHM constraints described in \u00a7VI.1 in conjunction with\nsaddle-point methods simplify the instanton calculus. In a nutshell, our results cast serious doubt on\nthe validity of the SCI calculations of the condensate. Specifically, we will demonstrate that in the SCI\napproach cluster decomposition is violated at leading order in 1\/N :\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(kN))\n\u232a\nSCI\nN\u2192\u221e\n6=\n\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232ak\nSCI\n. (7.5)\nOn the contrary, we will present a new calculation showing that the WCI approach is perfectly consis-\ntent with clustering at leading order in 1\/N . But we shall go further and argue that the WCI approach\nis also consistent with clustering for finite N . The important implications of this observation are as fol-\nlows. Since cluster decomposition is an essential requirement of quantum field theories (with very mild\nassumptions that are certainly met by supersymmetric Yang-Mills), the exact quantum correlators must\nhave this property. The fact that cluster decomposition is violated by the instanton-saturated SCI cor-\nrelators means that\u2014contrary to claims in the literature\u2014the SCI approximation is only giving part of\n48The same argument implies that only the kN -point functions are non-vanishing, matching the selection rule arising\nfrom counting fermion zero modes in the k-instanton background.\n99\nthe full answer. Since the SCI correlators obey supersymmetric perturbative non-renormalization theo-\nrems [65], it necessarily follows that additional non-perturbative configurations must be contributing to\nthe correlators. On the contrary we will argue that the WCI approach, which is a genuine semi-classical\ntechnique, is consistent with cluster decomposition. We believe that this conclusion is perfectly natural\nand simply underlines the fact that instantons are a semi-classical phenomenon and should only be\ntrusted at weak coupling. We should add that there are other non-instanton approaches to calculating\nthe gluino condensate, for instance, via softly-broken N = 2 gauge theory [67] solved using the theory of\nSeiberg and Witten [68], or from monopoles acting as instantons in the three-dimensional gauge theory\nthat arises after compactification on a circle [69, 70]. These alternative approaches all agree with the\nWCI answer.\nVII.1 A supersymmetric Ward identity\nA fundamental property of correlation functions involving insertions of lowest components of gauge\ninvariant chiral superfields, of which trN\u03bb\n2 is an example, is that they are independent of the insertion\npoints [38, 62]. It is of paramount importance for our subsequent arguments that this property is\npreserved within both the SCI and WCI approaches. To start with, let us briefly review the field\ntheoretic argument. For any gauge invariant chiral superfield \u03a6 = A(x) +\n\u221a\n2\u03b8\u03c8(x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 one can show\n\u2202\n\u2202xn\nA(x) = i\n4\n\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c8\u03b1(x) . (7.6)\nHere, we have defined \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 via the supersymmetry variation \u03b4 = \u03be\n\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1 + \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b4\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9. In particular,\n\u2202\n\u2202xn\ntrN \u03bb\n2 = \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1m trN Fmn\u03bb\u03b1\n)\n. (7.7)\nNow consider the derivative of a correlator of lowest-component fields with respect to one of the insertion\npoints:\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(l)\nn\n\u2329\nA1(x\n(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7Ap(x(p))\n\u232a\n= i\n4\n\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n\n\u2329\nA1(x\n(1)) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c8\u03b1(x(l)) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ap(x(p))\n\u232a\n. (7.8)\nThe supersymmetry variation can then be commuted through the operators to the left and right, since\nfor a lowest component of a gauge invariant chiral multiplet \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9Aj(x) = 0. Furthermore, the vacuum\nis a supersymmetry invariant so the right-hand side of (7.8) vanishes and the correlation function is\nindependent of the insertion point {x(l).\nThe question which we now address is whether the supersymmetric Ward identity described above is\nrespected in either the SCI or WCI approaches. In anN = 1 supersymmetric theory, the supersymmetry\ntransformation \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 lifts to the collective coordinates as (4.68) and (4.70): \u03b4\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b2\u02d9 = i\u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9M and \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M = 0.\nUsing (7.7), this means\n\u2202\n\u2202xn\ntrN \u03bb\n2(x) = i\n(\n\u00b5ui\n\u2202\n\u2202wui\u03b1\u02d9\n+ \u00b5\u00afiu\n\u2202\n\u2202w\u00afiu\u03b1\u02d9\n+M\u2032ij\u03b1\n\u2202\n\u2202a\u2032ij\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n\u03c3m\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9trN Fmn\u03bb\n\u03b1 (7.9)\nand, in addition, \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9trN \u03bb\n2 = 0. In the instanton background, therefore, the x(l) derivative of the multi-\npoint correlator of g2trN\u03bb\n2 is equal to an integral over Mk of a total derivative. We can use Gauss\u2019s\n100\nTheorem to write this as an integral over the boundary of Mk. The only possible contributions can\ncome from the large sphere at infinity or the small spheres surrounding one of the insertion points. To\njudge whether the contributions are non-vanishing we need to determine the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe integrand.\nFirst of all, consider the SCI instanton approach, for which the relevant collective coordinate measure\nis (5.55) with N = 1. Consider the contribution from the sphere of large radius R. By this we mean\nwhere the ADHM variables scale as\ntrk\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + a\n\u2032\nna\n\u2032\nn\n) R\u2192\u221e\n\u223c R2 . (7.10)\nThe relevant asymptotic behaviour we need is\ntrN \u03bb\n2\n\u223c R\u22124 , trN Fmn\u03bb \u223c R\u22124 , (7.11)\nso, collectively, the kN operator insertions scale as R\u22124kN . To complete the analysis we have to deter-\nmine the scaling of the supersymmetric volume form (5.55). There are two sources of R dependence:\nfirstly there are 4k(N+k)\u22121 integrals over the c-number collective coordinates on the boundary, giving\nR4k(N+k)\u22121, and secondly the the \u03b4-functions for the bosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints scale as\nR\u22124k\n2\n.49 Overall, therefore, the volume form on the boundary scales as R4kN\u22121. Putting this together\nwith the scaling of the operator insertions, we see that the contribution from the large sphere scales\nas R4kN\u22121 \u00d7 R\u22124kN = 1\/R and therefore vanishes as R \u2192 \u221e. Now consider the behaviour on a small\nsphere of radius R around one of the insertion points x(j):\ntrk\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + (a\n\u2032\nn + x\n(j)\nn 1[k]\u00d7[k])(a\n\u2032\nn + x\n(j)\nn 1[k]\u00d7[k])\n) R\u21920\n\u223c R2 . (7.12)\nOn this sphere, the insertion at x(j) scales as R\u22124, while the other insertions at other points remain\nfinite.50 The collective coordinate integral over this boundary scales as R4kN\u22121. Therefore, as long\nas we avoid making all the insertions at the same point, there is a vanishing contribution as R \u2192 0.\nSince there are no contributions from the boundaries, we conclude that the integral vanishes and the\nsupersymmetric Ward identity is respected within the SCI approach.\nNow we turn to the same considerations in the WCI approach. In this case, k instantons contribute to\nthe k-point function rather than the kN -point function. To leading order in the semi-classical expansion,\neven though the instantons are now constrained, the insertions take their ADHM form and so satisfy\n(7.9). Hence, we use the same logic to write the x(l)-derivative of the k-point function with respect to\none of the insertion points as a total derivative on Mk. However, there are some new subtleties. Firstly,\nsince we are on the Higgs branch, there is a non-trivial instanton effective action (6.55) characteristic of\na constrained instanton calculation. Since it is a supersymmetric invariant though, we can pull \u03b4\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 past\ne\u2212S\u02dc, as well as the other insertions, in order to apply Gauss\u2019s Theorem. However, the instanton effective\naction (6.55) will modifies the asymptotic behaviour on the large sphere of radius R. The bosonic terms\n49The 3k2 bosonic ADHM constraints are quadratic in the bosonic ADHM variables and so scale as R\u22126k\n2\nwhile the\n2k2 fermionic ADHM constraints are linear in the bosonic variables and so scale as R2k\n2\n, giving R\u22124k\n2\n.\n50Note that this argument is only valid if the insertion points are distinct. We shall find out by explicit calculation\nthat ambiguities can arise if too many insertions are made at the same point.\n101\nin S\u02dc effectively prevent 4k(N \u2212 1) of the variables {wui\u03b1\u02d9, w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu} from becoming large on the boundary\nmanifesting the fast that the instantons are constrained and there is a cut off on their size. Taking this\ninto account, the measure now scales effectively as R4k\u22121 on the sphere, rather than the R4kN\u22121 of the\nSCI approach. Each of the insertions (which are equal to their ADHM expressions to leading order)\nstill scale as (7.11) and so the insertions, together, scale as R4k. Overall, measure and insertions scale\nas 1\/R and so there is a vanishing contribution as R\u2192\u221e. Likewise it is straightforward to show that\nthere are no contributions from around the insertion points themselves. The point is that in this case\nthe instantons are small and so the constraining plays no ro\u02c6le and the analysis is identical to the SCI\ncase above. Consequently the k-point correlations functions are independent of the insertions points in\nthe WCI approach.\nVII.2 One instanton calculations of the gluino condensate\nIn the following subsections, we review the one-instanton SCI and WCI calculations of the gluino\ncondensate.\nVII.2.1 Strong coupling\nThe strong-coupling one-instanton calculation was done originally for gauge group SU(2) in [38] and\nthen extended to the SU(N) theories in [63] (see also the very comprehensive review articles [10, 12]).\nTo begin with the supersymmetric volume form on the instanton moduli space is given in (5.55).\nHowever, since at the one-instanton level N \u2265 2k \u2261 2, we find it more convenient to use the expression\ngiven in (6.29) where the ADHM \u03b4-functions have been resolved:\u222b\nM1\n\u03c9\n(1) =\n23N\u03c02N\u22122\n(N \u2212 1)!(N \u2212 2)!\n\u222b\n\u03c14N\u22128 d4X d\u03c12 d4(N\u22121)U d2M\u2032 d2\u03b6 d(N\u22122)\u03bd d(N\u22122)\u03bd\u00af . (7.13)\nHere, d4(N\u22121)U is the unit normalized (\n\u222b\nd4(N\u22121)U = 1) volume form for the gauge orientation of\nthe instanton. We have identified Xn = \u2212a\u2032n, the position of the instanton, \u03c1 =\n\u221a\nW 0\/2, the scale\nsize, and {M\u2032, \u03b6} as the Grassmann collective coordinates associated to broken supersymmetric and\nsuperconformal invariance. In particular, recall from \u00a7VI.1, the definitions\n\u00b5 = w\u03b1\u02d9\u03b6\n\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03bd , \u00b5\u00af = \u03b6\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03bd\u00af . (7.14)\nBy explicit evaluation, using (4.29) and the one-instanton formulae of \u00a7II.4.3, the gluino insertions in\nthe one-instanton background are\ng2trN \u03bb\n2(x) =\n4g\u03c12\u03bd\u00af\u03bd(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)3 + 6g\u03c1\n4\n(M\u2032\u03b1 + \u03b6\u03b1\u02d9(x\u00af\u2212 X\u00af)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1)(M\u2032\u03b1 \u2212 (x\u2212X)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03b6 \u03b1\u02d9)(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 . (7.15)\nWe then insert\n\u220fN\ni=1\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(i)) into the collective coordinate integral. Since in the confining phase\nthere is no symmetry breaking and the insertions are gauge invariant there is no dependence on the\n102\ngauge orientation of the instanton and one can simply integrate over the associated collective coordinates\u222b\nd4(N\u22121)U = 1. Next, let us carry out the Grassmann integrations. Obviously the \u03b6 andM\u2032 Grassmann\nintegrals have to be saturated from the insertions at two points {x(i), x(j)} chosen from amongst the N .\nAfter integrating over \u03b6 and M\u2032, the contribution from this pair is\n36\u03c18 (x(i) \u2212 x(j))2\n((x(i) \u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4((x(j) \u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 . (7.16)\nNow we take advantage of the fact that the N -point function is independent of the x(i), to choose the\ninsertion points for maximum simplicity of the algebra. The simplest conceivable such choice, x(i) = 0\nfor all i, turns out to give an ill-defined answer of the form \u201c0\u00d7\u221e\u201d (the zero coming from the Grassmann\nintegrations as follows from Eq. (7.16), and the infinity from divergences in the \u03c12 integration due to\ncoincident poles). In order to sidestep this ambiguity, one chooses instead:\nx(1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = x(N\u22121) = 0 , x(N) = x . (7.17)\nThis choice is the simplest which gives a well-defined answer with no \u201c0 \u00d7\u221e\u201d ambiguity. More am-\nbitiously, one can still perform the calculation even if all the insertion points are taken to be arbi-\ntrary [10,63]; however, we find it convenient to take the minimal resolution provided by (7.17). Due to\nthe (x(i) \u2212 x(j))2 factor in Eq. (7.16), it follows that the pair of insertions {x(i), x(j)} responsible for the\n{M\u2032, \u03b6} integrations must include the point x(N) = x; there are N \u2212 1 possible such pairs, giving\n36(N \u2212 1)\u03c18 x2\n((x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 (X2 + \u03c12)4 (7.18)\nfor these contributions. The remaining Grassmann integrations over {\u03bd, \u03bd\u00af} are saturated by the N \u2212 1\ninsertions at x(i) = 0, and give\n(N \u2212 2)!\n[\n4\u03c12\n(X2 + \u03c12)3\n]N\u22122\n. (7.19)\nCombining the denominators in Eqs. (7.18)-(7.19) with a Feynman parameter \u03b1,\n1\n(X2 + \u03c12)3N\u22122\n1\n((x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 =\n(3N + 1)!\n3!

(3N \u2212 1) ,\n(7.21)\nin agreement with Eqs. (7.2)-(7.3). In the final expression, we have used (5.17) to remove any dependence\non the running coupling in favour of the \u039b-parameter.\n103\nVII.2.2 Weak coupling\nNext, let us review the weak coupling instanton calculation of the gluino condensate. These kinds of\ncalculation were originally done in [50,64\u201366] and reviewed in [12]. The strategy here is to add sufficient\nmatter fields in order to completely break the gauge group by the Higgs mechanism. For matter fields\ntransforming in the fundamental representation, this means we need add NF = N \u2212 1 hypermultiplets,\nthat is N \u2212 1 chiral multiplets in both the N and N\u00af representations. On the Higgs branch, the scalar\nfields of the chiral multiplets qf and q\u02dcf , f = 1, . . . , NF gain a VEV. For the case NF = N \u2212 1 we\ncan choose the VEVs as in (6.51). For large values of the VEVs, the theory is weakly coupled and\nsemi-classical methods should be reliable. In contrast with the SCI calculation, in the weakly-coupled\nHiggs phase\n\u2329\ng2trN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\nreceives a non-zero contribution directly at the one-instanton level. Decoupling\nthe extraneous matter and matching to the low-energy pure gauge theory is then accomplished using\nstandard renormalization group prescriptions. What is absolutely crucial is that, due to holomorphy,\nthe value of the the gluino condensate is not renormalized as the matter is decoupled and in this way\na result calculated at weak coupling can yield a result also valid at strong coupling.\nWe now calculate the instanton contribution to the one-point function\n\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\nin the theory with\nNF = N \u2212 1. The instanton calculus in theories with fundamental matter fields is described in \u00a7VI.3.\nSince the scalar fields in the matter sector have VEVs the calculation involves constrained instantons.\nAs we have seen, to leading order (which in the present context is exact) the effect of constraining the\ninstantons appears at the level of the instanton effective action which becomes a non-trivial function of\nthe collective coordinates as is evident in (6.55).\nThe existence of the NF fundamental hypermultiplets leads to new Grassmann collective coordinates\n{K, K\u02dc} as described in \u00a7VI.3. The new feature of the semi-classical limit are integrals over these new\ncollective coordinates Eq. (6.58). To leading order in the semi-classical approximation, the instanton\nmeasure is obtained by amalgamating (5.14), for N = 1, with (6.58):\n\u00b5k(3N\u2212NF )gk(NF\u22123N)e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N=1,NF ) e\u2212S\u02dc , (7.22)\nwhere the volume form \u03c9(N ,NF ) is defined in (6.59).\nIn order to calculate the gluino condensate, we must insert into (7.22) (with NF = N \u2212 1) the one\ninstanton expression for g\n2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2. Note that in contrast to the SCI approach, in this WCI calculation\na single instanton contributes directly to the one-point function. However, since the matter fields have\nnon-vanishing VEVs the instantons are constrained as described in \u00a7IV.4. This seems to preclude an\nevaluation of the condensate because we do not actually know the exact profile of \u03bb in the constrained\ninstanton background. However, we do know the profile of \u03bb in the core of the instanton where it is\nwell approximated by its ADHM form (4.29). Now suppose we simply use the ADHM expression for\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2 (written in (7.15)) have we any right to expect this to be a a good approximation? At first\nit appears not because the ADHM profile behaves differently in the tail of the instanton where it has a\npower-law fall off rather than the exponential fall off of the constrained instanton. However, this would\nonly be a problem for large instantons which are in any case suppressed by the instanton effective action\n104\n(7.27). Consequently the error made in substituting the ADHM profile for the insertion will be higher\norder in g and as long as we are only after the leading order expression, the ADHM profile will suffice.\nHere is the rub: we know that the condensate cannot receive any corrections in g by holomorphy and\nso the result we obtain will therefore be exact.\nThe insertion g\n2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2 in the background of one instanton is given in (7.15) and is quadratic\nin Grassmann collective coordinates. Since in the measure (7.22) includes an integral over the two\nGrassmann collective coordinates associated to broken supersymmetry transformations M\u2032 and the\ninstanton effective action (7.27) is independent of them, the insertion must saturate these integrals:\u222b\nd2M\u2032 trN \u03bb2(x) = g\u22121 6\u03c1\n4(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 . (7.23)\nThe instanton effective action is likewise independent of the position of the instanton Xn and so the\nintegrals over these collective coordinates give\u222b\nd4X\n1(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 = \u03c0\n2\n6\u03c14\n. (7.24)\nWhat remains is then a supersymmetrized integral over the centred moduli space M\u03021. In fact the gluino\ncondensate in the case NF = N \u2212 1 can be written simply in terms of the centred instanton partition\nfunction (6.103) as \u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= 1\n2\n\u00b52N+1g\u22122Ne2\u03c0i\u03c4 Z\u0302(N=1,NF=N\u22121)1 . (7.25)\nAt the one-instanton level, since N \u2265 2k \u2261 2, we can use results from \u00a7VI.1 to resolve the bosonic\nADHM constraints. When this has been done the centred one-instanton partition function is\nZ\u0302\n(N=1,NF=N\u22121)\n1 =\n23N\u22123\u03c02N\u22122\u22122NF\n(N \u2212 1)!(N \u2212 2)!\n\u222b\n\u03c14N\u22128 d\u03c12 d4(N\u22121)U\n\u00d7 dN \u00b5\u00af dN\u00b5 dNFK dNF K\u02dc\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5+ \u00b5\u00afw\u03b1\u02d9\n)\ne\u2212S\u02dc ,\n(7.26)\nwhere the the instanton effective action is (6.55) (with the choice of VEVs (6.51))\nS\u02dc = 2\u03c02\u03c12\nN\u22121\u2211\nf=1\n|vf |2\n(|Uf1|2 + |Uf2|2)+ i\u03c02\u221a\n2\nN\u22121\u2211\nf=1\n(\nv\u2217fKf\u00b5f \u2212 v\u02dc\u2217f \u00b5\u00affK\u02dcf\n)\n. (7.27)\nHere, we have used the one-instanton form for w\u03b1\u02d9 in terms of the gauge orientation U in Eq. (2.94).\nNotice that the form of the measure that we will use (7.26) is rather schizophrenic, since we have chosen\nto resolve the bosonic ADHM constraints as in \u00a7VI.1, but not the fermionic ones, as indicated by the\nremaining Grassmann \u03b4-functions in (7.26).\nWe now evaluate the partition function explicitly. First of all, the {Kf , K\u02dcf} and {\u00b5u, \u00b5\u00afu}, u 6= N ,\nintegrals are saturated by pulling down powers of the Yukawa coupling terms in the instanton effective\naction (7.27). This yields a constant term( \u03c02\u221a\n2\n)2(N\u22121) N\u22121\u220f\nf=1\n(vf v\u02dcf)\n\u2217 . (7.28)\n105\nThe integrals over the two remaining Grassmann variables {\u00b5N , \u00b5\u00afN} are saturated by the Grassmann\n\u03b4-functions: \u222b\nd\u00b5N d\u00b5\u00afN\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\nw\u00afN\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5N + \u00b5\u00afNwN\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n= \u03c12\n(|UN1|2 + |UN2|2) . (7.29)\nPutting all these factor together, we have the remaining bosonic integrals to perform\nZ\u0302\n(N=1,NF=N\u22121)\n1 = =\n\u03c04N\u2212822N\u22121\n(N \u2212 1)!(N \u2212 2)!\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\nv\u2217f v\u02dc\n\u2217\nf\n\u222b\nd4X d\u03c12 d4(N\u22121)U\n\u00d7 \u03c14N\u22126(|UN1|2 + |UN2|2) exp [\u2212 2\u03c02\u03c12 N\u22121\u2211\nf=1\n|vf |2\n(|Uf1|2 + |Uf2|2)] .\n(7.30)\nThe integral over the scale size is\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03c12 \u03c14N\u22126 exp\n[\u2212 2\u03c02\u03c12 N\u22121\u2211\nf=1\nv2f\n(|Uf1|2 + |Uf2|2)] = (2N \u2212 3)!(\n2\u03c02\n\u2211N\u22121\nf=1 v\n2\nf\n(|Uf1|2 + |Uf2|2))2N\u22122 . (7.31)\nThis leaves the remaining integral over the gauge orientation U which can be done by using the formulae\nin Ref. [71]:51\u222b\nd4(N\u22121)U\n|UN1|2 + |UN2|2[\u2211N\u22121\nf=1 v\n2\nf\n(|Uf1|2 + |Uf2|2)]2N\u22122 =\n(N \u2212 1)!(N \u2212 2)!\n(2N \u2212 3)!\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\n|vf |\u22124 . (7.32)\nCollecting the results, we have\nZ\u0302\n(N=1,NF=N\u22121)\n1 = 2\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\n(vf v\u02dcf )\n\u22121 (7.33)\nand hence \u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= \u00b52N+1g\u22122Ne2\u03c0i\u03c4\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\n(vf v\u02dcf )\n\u22121 . (7.34)\nThe result (7.34) is expressed in terms of bare quantities and involves the Pauli-Villars mass-scale \u00b5.\nWe need to re-express it in terms of renormalized quantities. Firstly, the bare VEVs vf and v\u02dcf should\nbe replaced by Z\n1\/2\nf v\nren.\nf and Z\n1\/2\nf v\u02dc\nren.\nf , respectively, where Zf is the usual multiplicative wavefunction\nrenormalization factor. From now on we shall drop the \u201cren.\u201d superscripts on the renormalized VEVs\nwith the understanding that, henceforth, all quantities are understood to be renormalized. The coupling\nconstant g and multiplicative renormalization factors Zf run with the Pauli-Villars mass scale \u00b5 in such\na way that the remaining factors are equal to a certain power of the strong coupling scale of the theory\nin the Pauli-Villars scheme:\n\u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121) = e\n\u22128\u03c02\/g(\u00b5)2+i\u03b8\u00b52N+1g(\u00b5)\u22122N\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\nZf(\u00b5)\n\u22121 , (7.35)\n51Alternatively, making the choice vf = v\u02dcf \u2261 v yields an elementary integral.\n106\ngeneralizing the NF = 0 relation (5.17). Note that due to holomorphy this relation must be exact. By\ndifferentiating with respect to \u00b5 this yields an exact expression for the \u03b2-function. It is an example of\nthe more general relation for arbitrary NF\n\u039b3N\u2212NF\n(NF )\n= e\u22128\u03c0\n2\/g(\u00b5)2+i\u03b8\u00b53N\u2212NF g(\u00b5)\u22122N\nNF\u220f\nf=1\nZf (\u00b5)\n\u22121 , (7.36)\nwhich upon differentiation leads to the famous Novikov-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov \u03b2-function of su-\npersymmetric QCD [12,72]:\n\u00b5\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u00b5\n= \u2212\u03b1\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u00b7 3N \u2212\n\u2211NF\nf=1(1\u2212 \u03b3f)\n1\u2212 N\u03b1\n2\u03c0\n, \u03b1 \u2261 g\n2\n4\u03c0\n, \u03b3f \u2261 \u2212d lnZf\nd ln\u00b5\n(7.37)\nThe final result for the gluino condensate is\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= \u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\n(vf v\u02dcf)\n\u22121 . (7.38)\nWe still have to relate the value of the gluino condensate (7.38) in the Higgs phase to that in the\nconfining phase. In other words, we have to track the value of the gluino condensate as we decouple\nthe matter fields. In order to achieve this in a controlled way, it is useful to re-interpret (7.38) in terms\nof a coupling in the low energy effective superpotential Weff for the matter fields in the Higgs phase. In\norder to determine the superpotential we exploit the general functional identity (see for example [73]):\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= b\u221210 \u039b\n\u2202\n\u2202\u039b\n\u3008Weff\u3009 . (7.39)\nHere, \u039b is the appropriate strong coupling scale and b0 is the first coefficient of the \u03b2-function, equal\nto 3N \u2212 NF = 2N + 1 in the present context. Since, the expression for the superpotential must be\ninvariant under gauge and global symmetries, it can be uniquely determined:\nWeff =\n\u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\ndet Q\u02dcQ\n. (7.40)\nThis is the famous Affleck-Dine-Seiberg (ADS) superpotential for N = 1 supersymmetric SU(N) QCD.\n(See Ref. [50] for the SU(2) case and Ref. [74] for the SU(N) calculation.) Note we have arrived at the\nADS superpotential by a somewhat different route to Refs. [50,74]. In those references, the form of the\nsuperpotential was deduced by first noticing that after the Higgs mechanism, there is a combination of\nthe matter fields which remains classically massless. The ADS superpotential then implies that these\nclassically massless fields receive a non-perturbative mass through a one-instanton effect. This mass, and\nhence the form of the superpotential itself, can be deduced by calculating the long distance behaviour\nof the two-point function of the massless component of the anti-Higgsinos \u03c7\u00af and \u00af\u02dc\u03c7. The computation\ninvolves using a single constrained instanton but to leading order we can replace the massless component\nof \u03c7\u00af and \u00af\u02dc\u03c7 by their value in the ADHM instanton background.52 The net result of this calculation is\nentirely consistent with our approach via the gluino condensate.\n52Notice that this involves iterating the constrained instanton to the required order where the anti-chiral fermions are\nnon-zero.\n107\nAs it stands, the ADS superpotential implies that the vacuum runs away away to infinity. One way\nto stabilize the theory is to add a small mass term. Using the ubiquitous holomorphy argument, the\nmass cannot get renormalized and will appear directly in the effective superpotential:\nWeff =\n\u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\ndet Q\u02dcQ\n+\nN\u22121\u2211\nf=1\nmfQ\u02dcfQf . (7.41)\nThe superpotential (7.41) now has well defined critical points at\nmfvf v\u02dcf =\n\u039b2N+1(N\u22121)\u220fN\u22121\nf \u2032=1 vf \u2032 v\u02dcf \u2032\n. (7.42)\nIt is easy to see that there are N solutions where vf v\u02dcf differ by N\nth roots of unity. At these critical\npoints the values of the gluino condensate obtained by using (7.39) are\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n=\n(\n\u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\nmf\n)1\/N\n, (7.43)\nwhich exhibits the N -fold degeneracy explicitly via the choice of the N th root.\nThe result (7.43) is justified in the weakly-coupled Higgs phase where the VEVs are large (or masses\nsmall) compared with \u039b(N\u22121). However the powerful Ward Identities of supersymmetric theory allow us\nto extrapolate the result into the regime of small VEV (large masses) and strong coupling. The point is\nthat since trN \u03bb\n2 is gauge-invariant and the lowest component of a chiral superfield, its VEV must be a\nholomorphic expression in the coupling constants of the theory. In the present context this means \u039b(N\u22121)\nand the masses. This implies that the result (7.43) cannot be subject to any perturbative corrections\nsince a power series in g would translate into an expression which could not be holomorphic in \u039b(N\u22121).\nHence, (7.43) must also be valid for small VEVs, or, correspondingly from (7.42), large masses. This\nis precisely the limit in which the matter fields are decoupled and the theory should flow into the pure\nN = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory. In particular the N supersymmetric vacua that we see at weak\ncoupling are continuously connected with the N supersymmetric vacua of the pure gauge theory. In\norder to track the value of the gluino condensate from weak to strong coupling we simply have to match\nthe \u039b-parameters of the two theories. The correct renormalization group matching in this case is [54,75]\n\u039b3N = \u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\nN\u22121\u220f\nf=1\nmf . (7.44)\nFinally putting (7.43) together with (7.44), we deduce\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232a\n= \u039b3e2\u03c0iu\/N , (7.45)\nfor u = 1, . . . , N which is the expression in (7.4).\nVII.3 Multi-instanton calculations of the gluino condensate\nIn this section, we calculate the contributions of arbitrary numbers of instantons to the gluino condensate\nin both the SCI and WCI approaches at large N where saddle-point methods are available to simplify\nthe instanton calculus.\n108\nVII.3.1 Strong coupling\nIn \u00a7VI.1, we derived a form for the multi-instanton volume form in a supersymmetric gauge theory\nwith N \u2265 2k. In the confining phase there is symmetry breaking and all insertions are gauge invariant,\nhence, we can immediately integrate over the gauge orientation:\n\u222b\nd4k(N\u2212k)U = 1. This gauge invariant\nform for the multi-instanton volume form is now particularly useful for taking a large-N limit.\nIn order to calculate the kN -point correlation function, we must insert into the measure the expres-\nsion for g\n2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2 evaluated in the k ADHM instanton background. At the multi-instanton level we\nfind it useful to use the identity (C.22) to express the insertions as\ntrN \u03bb\n2 =\n1\n4g\n\u0003 trkM\u00af(P + 1)Mf . (7.46)\nAs proved earlier, the correlation function is expected to be independent of the insertion points and\nso, as in the one-instanton sector in \u00a7VII.1, the {x(l)} can therefore be chosen for maximum simplicity\nof the algebra. The simplest conceivable choice, x(l) = 0 for all l, results in an ill-defined answer of\nthe form \u201c0 \u00d7\u221e\u201d (the zero coming from unsaturated Grassmann integrations, and the infinity from\ndivergences in the bosonic integrations due to coincident poles); we have already noted this fact in the\none-instanton sector in \u00a7VII.2.1. The simplest choice of the {x(l)} that avoids this problem, generalizing\n(7.17), is\nx(1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = x(kN\u2212k2) = 0 ,\nx(kN\u2212k\n2+1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = x(kN) \u2261 x (7.47)\nwhich we adopt for the remainder of this section.53\nIn the large-N limit, there is a large preponderance of insertions (7.47) at x(l) = 0, and the resulting\nfactor of (trN\u03bb\n2(0))k(N\u2212k), taken together with the Jacobian factor |det2kW |N\u22122k from the measure\n(6.29), dominate the integral and can be treated in a saddle-point approximation. Below we will carry\nout this saddle-point evaluation in full detail, but we can already quite easily understand the source of\nthe linear dependence on k in our final result. The argument goes as follows:\n(i) Let us imagine carrying out all the Grassmann integrations in the problem. The remaining large-\nN integrand will then have the form exp\n( \u2212 N\u0393 +O(logN)) where \u0393 might be termed the \u201ceffective\nlarge-N instanton action.\u201d The large-N saddle-points are then the stationary points of \u0393 with respect\nto the c-number collective coordinates. By Lorentz symmetry, \u0393 can only depend on the four k \u00d7 k\nmatrices a\u2032n through even powers of a\n\u2032\nn. (This is because the bulk of the insertions have been chosen\nto be at x(l) = 0; otherwise one could form the Lorentz scalar xna\n\u2032\nn and so have odd powers of a\n\u2032\nn.) It\nfollows that the ansatz\na\u2032n = 0 , n = 1, 2, 3, 4 , (7.48a)\nW c = 0 , c = 1, 2, 3 (7.48b)\n53As a nontrivial check on the Ward identity, we have also numerically integrated the large-N correlator for insertions\nother than Eq. (7.47), and verified the constancy of the answer presented below.\n109\nis automatically a stationary point of \u0393 with respect to these collective coordinates. (Note that (7.48b)\nfollows automatically from (7.48a) by virtue of the ADHM constraints (6.3).) It will actually turn out\nthat, once one assumes these saddle-point values, \u0393 is independent of the remaining collective coordinate\nmatrix W 0; furthermore we will verify that this saddle-point is actually a minimum of \u0393.\n(ii) Having anticipated the saddle-point (7.48a)-(7.48b) using these elementary symmetry consid-\nerations, let us back up to a stage in the analysis prior to the Grassmann integration, and proceed a\nlittle more carefully. Evaluating the insertions trN\u03bb\n2(x(l)) on this saddle-point, one easily verifies that\nthe \u03b6 modes vanish when x(l) = 0; consequently the \u03b6 integrations must be saturated entirely from the\nk2 insertions at x(l) = x. This leaves the M\u2032, \u03bd and \u03bd\u00af integrations to be saturated purely from the\ninsertions at x(l) = 0. Moreover, becauseM\u2032 carries a Weyl spinor index \u03b1 whereas \u03bd and \u03bd\u00af do not, the\ntrN\u03bb\n2(0) insertions depend on these Grassmann coordinates only through bi-linears of the form \u03bd\u00af \u00d7 \u03bd\nor M\u2032 \u00d7M\u2032; there are no cross terms.\n(iii) Performing all the Grassmann integrations then automatically generates a combinatoric factor\n(k2)! (k2)! (kN \u2212 2k2)!\n(\nkN \u2212 k2\nk2\n)\n. (7.49)\nHere the first three factors account for the indistinguishable bi-linear insertions of the \u03b6,M\u2032, and {\u03bd, \u03bd\u00af}\nmodes, respectively, while the final factor counts the ways of selecting the k2 bi-linears in M\u2032 from\nthe kN \u2212 k2 insertions at x(i) = 0. Multiplying these combinatoric factors together, as well as the\nnormalization constants from then instanton measure, and taking the (kN)th root yields, in the large-N\nlimit: [\nAk(C\n(1)\n1 )\nk (k2)! (kN \u2212 k2)!]1\/kN N\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 23\u03c02eN\u22121k\u039b3 +O(N\u22122) . (7.50)\nRemarkably, apart from a factor of four, this back-of-the-envelope analysis precisely accounts for the\nleading term in the 1\/N in the final answer, Eq. (7.63) below. Note that most of the remaining\ncontributions to the saddle-point analysis, which involve a specific convergent bosonic integral derived\nbelow, as well as the factor 23k\n2\n\/VolU(k) from Eq. (6.29), reduce to unity when the (kN)th root is\ntaken in the large-N limit; the missing factor of four will simply come from the leading saddle-point\nevaluation of the bosonic integrand.\nHere are the details of the large-N calculation of the kN -point correlation function. First, we find\nit convenient to partially fix the auxiliary U(k) symmetry by taking a basis where W 0 is diagonal:\nW 0 = diag\n(\n2\u03c121, . . . , 2\u03c1\n2\nk\n)\n. (7.51)\nAs the notation implies, in the dilute instanton gas limit \u03c1i can be identified with the scale size of the\nith instanton in the k-instanton sector (see \u00a7IV.2). The appropriate gauge fixing involves a Jacobian:\n1\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\ndk\n2\nW 0 \u2212\u2192 2\n3k(k\u22121)\/2\u03c0\u2212k\nk!\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nk\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03c12i\nk\u220f\ni<j=1\n(\u03c12i \u2212 \u03c12j )2 . (7.52)\nFor k = 1 one has, of course,\n\u222b\ndW 0 \u2192 2 \u222b\u221e\n0\nd\u03c12.\n110\nNow let us consider the Grassmann integrations, beginning with the \u03b6 variables. We assume the\nsaddle-point conditions (7.48a)-(7.48b), in which case\n\u2206 =\n(\nw\nx \u00b7 1\n[k]\u00d7[k]\n)\n, f = diag\n(\n1\nx2+\u03c121\n, . . . , 1\nx2+\u03c12\nk\n)\n(7.53)\nand from Eq. (7.46),\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x) =\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\n(\u03b6\u03b1\u02d9)ij(\u03b6\n\u03b1\u02d9)ji Fij(x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (7.54)\nwhere\nFij(x) =\n1\n4g\n\u0003\nx4\n(x2 + \u03c12i )(x\n2 + \u03c12j )\n(7.55)\nand the terms omitted in Eq. (7.54) represent dependence on the other Grassmann collective coordinates\n{M\u2032, \u03bd, \u03bd\u00af}. It is obvious from Eq. (7.55) that Fij(0) = 0, so that the \u03b6 must be entirely saturated from\nthe k2 insertions at x(i) = x as claimed above. Performing the \u03b6 integrations then yields\n(k2)!\nk\u220f\ni,j=1\nFij(x) . (7.56)\nNext we consider the insertions at x(l) = 0. Focusing on theM\u2032 modes first, one finds from Eq. (7.46):\ntrN\u03bb\n2(0) =\n2\ng\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\n(M\u2032\u03b1)ij(M\u2032\u03b1)ji (\u03c1\u22124i + \u03c1\u22124j + \u03c1\u22122i \u03c1\u22122j ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (7.57)\nomitting the \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bd\u00af terms. Hence the M\u2032 integrations yield\n2k\n2\ngk2\n(\nkN \u2212 k2\nk2\n)\n(k2)!\nk\u220f\ni,j=1\n(\u03c1\u22124i + \u03c1\n\u22124\nj + \u03c1\n\u22122\ni \u03c1\n\u22122\nj ) , (7.58)\nwhere the combinatoric factors in (7.58) (as well as in (7.56)) have been explained previously.54\nFinally we turn to the {\u03bd, \u03bd\u00af} integrations. Since (unlike \u03b6 andM\u2032) the number of \u03bd and \u03bd\u00af variables\ngrows with N as kN \u2212 2k2, it does not suffice merely to plug in the saddle-point values (7.48a)-(7.48b)\nand (7.53). One must also calculate the Gaussian determinant about the saddle-point, which provides\nan O(N0) multiplicative contribution to the answer. Accordingly we expand about (7.48a)-(7.48b) to\nquadratic order in the a\u2032n. From (7.46), the \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bd\u00af contribution to trN\u03bb2(0) has the form\n\u2212 1\n2g\ntrk \u03bd\u00af\u03bd\u0003 f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\n=\n2\ng\ntrk \u03bd\u00af\u03bdf b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\n(7.59)\nas follows from the differentiation formula (C.2b). Performing the {\u03bd, \u03bd\u00af} integrations therefore gives\n(kN \u2212 2k2)! exp\n{\n(N \u2212 2k)trk log\n(\n2f b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\n}\n= (kN \u2212 2k2)! exp\n{\n(N \u2212 2k)( log detk16(W 0)\u22122 \u2212 32 k\u2211\ni,j=1\n(a\u2032n)ij(a\n\u2032\nn)ji (\u03c1\n\u22122\ni + \u03c1\n\u22122\nj ) + O(a\u2032n)4\n) }\n.\n(7.60)\n54One can easily check that these large-N formulae are consistent with the explicit 1-instanton calculation presented\nin \u00a7VII.2.1 which is exact in N .\n111\nThe negative sign in front of the quadratic term in a\u2032n confirms that our saddle-point (7.48a)-(7.48b)\nis in fact a minimum of the action. Combining this expression with the measure factor in Eq. (6.29),\nnamely\u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223N\u22122k = exp ((N \u2212 2k) log det2kW ) = exp{(N \u2212 2k)( log detk(12W 0)2 + O(a\u2032n)4 )} , (7.61)\nand performing the Gaussian integrations over a\u2032n, yields:\n22k(N\u22122k) (kN \u2212 2k2)!\nk\u220f\ni,j=1\n(\n2\u03c0\n3N(\u03c1\u22122i + \u03c1\n\u22122\nj )\n)2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (7.62)\nwhere the omitted terms are suppressed by powers of 1\/N .\nFinally one combines Eqs. (6.29), (3.23), (7.56), (7.58) and (7.62) (and the definition of the \u039b-\nparameter in (5.17)) to obtain the leading-order result for the correlator:\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(kN))\n\u232a\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 2\nkN+k2\u2212k+1\/2 \u03c0\u2212k+1\/2 ekN (k2)! kkN\u2212k\n2+1\/2 \u039b3kN\n32k2 NkN+k2\u22121\/2 k!\nIk ,\n(7.63)\nwhere Ik is the convergent integral\nIk =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nk\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03c12i\nk\u220f\ni,j\ni6=j\n|\u03c12i \u2212 \u03c12j | \u00b7\nk\u220f\ni,j=1\nFij(x)\n(\n1\u2212 (\u03c1j\/\u03c1i + \u03c1i\/\u03c1j)\u22122\n)\n. (7.64)\nNote that Ik is independent of x as a simple re-scaling argument confirms. For the simple case k = 1,\nI1 =\n3\n2\nand the expression (7.63) agrees\u2014as it must\u2014with the large-N limit of the one-instanton result\nin Eq. (7.21).\nVII.3.2 Weak coupling\nIn this section, we turn to multi-instanton effects in the WCI approach. We apply the same large-N\nsaddle-point methods to extract the large-N behaviour of the k-instanton contribution to the k-point\nof g\n2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2. In order to make the calculation more manageable, we will choose the VEVs from the\noutset to be v1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = vN\u22121 = v\u02dc1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = v\u02dcN\u22121 \u2261 v. In this case, the bosonic part of the instanton\neffective action (6.55) can be written as\nS\u02dcb = \u03c0\n2v2tr2k(W \u2212 \u03be\u2020uu\u2020\u03be) . (7.65)\nHere, W and \u03be are the 2k \u00d7 2k matrix defined in (6.1) and (2.83), respectively, and the complex 2k\nvector ui\u03b1\u02d9 is defined in terms of the gauge orientation via\nu =\n(\nU1N , . . . ,U2k,N\n)\n. (7.66)\nNotice that the correlation function only depends on the gauge orientation through the vector u in the\ninstanton effective action (7.65). So we need an expression for the reduced measure\n\u222b\ndU =\n\u222b\nd2ku f(u).\n112\nWe now pause to evaluate the function f(u). The complex 2k-vector u is composed of the first 2k\ncomponents of the complex unit N -vector U = (U1N , . . . ,UNN). Let u\u02dc = (U2k+1,N , . . . ,UNN) be the\ncomplementary complex (N \u2212 2k)-vector: U = u+ u\u02dc. It is clear that the measure on the unit vector U\ninherited from the group measure\n\u222b\ndU is proportional to\u222b\nd2NU \u03b4(|U |2 \u2212 1) =\n\u222b\nd4ku d2(N\u22122k)u\u02dc \u03b4(|u|2 + |u\u02dc|2 \u2212 1) . (7.67)\nThe measure on u is obtained by integrating over u\u02dc giving (up to constant)\u222b\n|u|\u22641\nd4ku (1\u2212 |u|2)N\u22122k\u22121 . (7.68)\nActually (7.68) is still too general for our needs. It will be sufficient for our purposes to know the\nmeasure on the k quantities zi = u\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni ui\u03b1\u02d9 (with no sum on i). The measure on the {zi} follows easily\nfrom (7.68). Finally, taking into account the normalization (6.17), we have the required expression for\nthe reduced measure of the gauge orientation:\u222b\nd4k(N\u2212k)U =\n\u0393(N)\n2\u0393(N \u2212 2k)\n\u222b 1\n0\n{ k\u220f\ni=1\ndzi zi\n}(\n1\u2212\nk\u2211\ni=1\nzi\n)N\u22122k\u22121\n, (7.69)\nwith the constraint\n\u2211k\ni=1 zi \u2264 1.\nWe now have all the ingredients needed to start a large-N analysis. In this limit, we will evaluate\nthe collective coordinate integral by a method of steepest descent. As usual in such a saddle-point\nanalysis, one exponentiates any terms in the collective coordinate integral raised to the power N , and\nincludes them, along with the bosonic terms in the instanton effective action, in a large-N effective\naction. There are two contributions besides the instanton effective action (7.65). The first, is the factor\nof |det2kW |N in the measure (6.29) and the second the factor of (1\u2212|u|2)N in the measure for the gauge\norientation (7.68). Placing all these contributions up in exponent the defines a saddle-point action:\n\u0393 = \u2212N log det2k\n(\n1\n2\nW 01[2]\u00d7[2] \u2212 2a\u2032ma\u2032n\u03c3\u00afmn\n)\n+ \u03c02v2tr2k(W \u2212 \u03be\u00afuu\u00af\u03be)\u2212N log(1\u2212 |u|2) . (7.70)\nNow we find the extrema of \u0393 with respect to the independent variables a\u2032n, W\n0 and u\u03b1\u02d9.\nRather than write down the saddle-point equations and proceed to solve them, we will simply write\ndown an ansatz for the solution and then show ex post facto from a fluctuation analysis that it is indeed\nan extremum. Up to the auxiliary U(k) symmetry, our ansatz is\nW 0 =\nN\n\u03c02v2\n1[k]\u00d7[k] , (7.71a)\na\u2032n = \u2212diag(X1n, . . . , Xkn) , (7.71b)\nui\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (7.71c)\nThese values imply\n\u03be =\n\u221a\nN\n2\u03c02v2\n1[2k]\u00d7[2k] , W =\nN\n2\u03c02v2\n1[2k]\u00d7[2k] . (7.72)\n113\nThe solution has a simple physical interpretation. It represents k instantons in the dilute-gas limit\nwith positions X in, all with the same scale size\n\u221a\nN\/(2\u03c02v2) inhabiting k mutually commuting SU(2)\nsubgroups of the gauge group55 orthogonal to the gauge orientation of the VEV (since ui\u03b1\u02d9 = 0). The\nfact that the instantons live in commuting subgroups of the gauge group implies that they are non-\ninteracting and the solution is dilute-gas-like.\nWe now turn to an analysis of the fluctuations around the solution (7.71a)-(7.71c). The explicit\nexpression for the expansion of action around the saddle-point to quadratic order is\n\u0393(2) = 2kN(1 + log(2\u03c02v2\/N)) +\n(2\u03c02v2)2\n4N\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u03b4W 0ij\u03b4W\n0\nji\n+\n(2\u03c02v2)2\nN\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)2(a\u2032n)ij(a\u2032n)ji +\nN\n4\nk\u2211\ni=1\nz2i ,\n(7.73)\nwhere we have removed the cross terms between fluctuations involving \u03b4W 0 with u and a\u2032n with u by\nappropriate shifts in \u03b4W 0 and a\u2032n. At this point, we find it convenient to fix the U(k) symmetry by\nmaking the \u201cgauge choice\u201d (2.100) for the fluctuations a\u2032n and then denote the remaining fluctuations\na\u02dc\u2032n.\nTo leading order in the 1\/N expansion, we substitute the saddle-point expressions for the vari-\nables (7.71a)-(7.71b) into the insertions. Due to the dilute-gas nature of the saddle-point solution, at\nleading order, each insertion g\n2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2 will be a sum over k one-instanton expressions involving the\none-instanton collective coordinates {\u03c1i, X in, ui\u03b1\u02d9,M\u2032ii, \u00b5ui, \u00b5\u00afui} for a fixed i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. In particular,\nthe only dependence on the Grassmann collective coordinatesM\u2032ii is through the insertions because at\nleading order they decouple from the fermionic ADHM constraints. Therefore using the one-instanton\nexpression (7.15), we can replace each insertion with\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x) \u2212\u2192\nk\u2211\ni=1\n2\u221253\u03c0\u22126v\u22124gN2(\n(x\u2212X i)2 +N\/(2\u03c02v2))4 (M\u2032\u03b1)ii(M\u2032\u03b1)ii . (7.74)\nEven at this intermediate stage in the calculation we can draw an important conclusion. Since, to\nleading order, the insertions do not involve any \u201coff-diagonal\u201d collective coordinates which communicate\nbetween the individual instantons of the saddle-point solution, the result for the correlation function is\ndestined to cluster correctly. Nevertheless, it is interesting to show how this happens explicitly.\nAs we have noted, the leading order expression for the insertions are independent of the fluctuations\n55The generators of the SU(2) embeddings of the k instantons in the dilute limit are given in (2.103). The fact that\nthe commutators of these generators for different instantons vanishes follows from the fact that the solution above has\nW c = 0.\n114\n\u03b4W 0ij and a\u02dc\n\u2032\nn; hence, we can immediately integrate them out:\u222b\ndk\n2\n\u03b4W 0 d3k(k\u22121)a\u02dc\u2032 exp\n{\n\u2212 (2\u03c0\n2v2)2\n4N\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u03b4W 0ij\u03b4W\n0\nji \u2212\n(2\u03c02v2)2\nN\nk\u2211\ni,j=1\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)2(a\u2032n)ij(a\u2032n)ji\n}\n=\n(\nN\u03c0\n\u03c04v4\n)k2\/2(\nN\u03c0\n4\u03c04v4\n)4k(k\u22121)\/2 k\u220f\ni,j=1\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)\u22123 .\n(7.75)\nWe have succeeded in integrating out all the off-diagonal c-number collective coordinates. Now for\nthe Grassmann sector. The off-diagonal elements ofM\u2032\u03b1 do not appear in the instanton effective action\n(6.55) and, at leading order in 1\/N , in the insertions (7.74); hence, the integrals over these quantities\nmust be saturated by the fermionic ADHM constraints. Since at the saddle point a\u2032n is diagonal, the\nintegrals are \u222b k\u220f\ni,j=1\ni6=j\n{\nd2M\u2032ij\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\n(X\u00af i \u2212 X\u00afj)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1(M\u2032\u03b1)ij\n)}\n=\nk\u220f\ni,j=1\ni6=j\n(X i \u2212Xj)2 . (7.76)\nThis conveniently cancels against similar factors in (3.23) and (7.75).\nThe integrals that remain are over the positions of the instantons X in, the gauge orientation co-\nordinates zi and the Grassmann collective coordinates {\u00b5iu, \u00b5\u00afiu, (M\u2032\u03b1)ii,K, K\u02dc}. The integrals over\nthe remaining Grassmann collective coordinates proceeds as for the exact one-instanton calculation\nin \u00a7VII.2.2: the {K, K\u02dc} and {\u00b5ui, \u00b5\u00afiu} integrals are saturated by bringing down terms from the instan-\nton effective action (6.55), as in (7.28) for each i. The integrals over the remaining variables {\u00b5Ni, \u00b5\u00afiN}\nare then saturated by the diagonal fermionic ADHM constraints, as in (7.29), for each i.\nPutting all the pieces together, we have the leading order 1\/N contribution\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(k))\n\u232a\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 3\nk\u00b5k(2N+1)g\u22122kNe2\u03c0ik\u03c4v\u22122kNN3k\/2\n2k\u03c09k\/2k!\n\u00d7\n\u2211\nperms\n{li} of {1,...,k}\nk\u220f\ni=1\n{\u222b\nd4X i\n1(\n(x(li) \u2212X i)2 +N\/(2\u03c02v2))4\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndzi z\n2\ni e\n\u2212Nz2i \/4\n}\n.\n(7.77)\nPerforming the remaining integrals\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(k))\n\u232a\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192\n(\n\u00b52N+1g2Ne2\u03c0i\u03c4v\u22122(N\u22121)\n)k\n(7.78)\nAfter renormalizing the VEV and matching to the pure gauge theory in the way described the end of\n\u00a7VII.2.2, our leading-order large-N result is\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(k))\n\u232a\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 \u039b3k . (7.79)\nAs noted above above, clustering is satisfied at large N .\n115\nVII.4 Clustering in instanton calculations\nTaking the SCI calculations in \u00a7VII.2.1 and \u00a7VII.3.1, compare the kN th-root of (7.63) with the large-N\nlimit of the N th-root of the one-instanton result (7.21):\n2e\nN\nk\u039b3 +O(N\u22122) verses 2e\nN\n\u039b3 +O(N\u22122) . (7.80)\nThe implication is that the clustering property of the field theory is not respected by approximating\nthe functional integral with an integral over instantons in the confining phase. In Ref. [67], it was\nfurther shown that the existence of the Shifman-Kovner vacuum designed to reconcile the SCI and\nWCI at the one-instanton level, cannot account for the mismatch (7.80) for general k. We interpret\nthe result to mean that instantons in the confining phase by themselves cannot account for all of the\ngluino condensate and that additional non-perturbative configurations must necessarily contribute. This\nconclusion is also supported by numerical calculations of the two-instanton contribution to four-point\nfunction for gauge group SU(2) which were performed in [67].\nIn contrast the WCI approach is consistent with clustering, at least at large N : compare (7.45) with\n(7.79). But we can argue further that consistency with clustering is guaranteed in the WCI approach,\neven at finite N . The argument proceeds as follows. Suppose one calculated the k-instanton contribution\nto the k-point function in the regime where |x(i) \u2212 x(j)| \u226b g\/v, where v is the characteristic scale of\nthe VEVs. In other words, the separation between the insertions is much greater than the effective\ncut-off on the instanton scale size imposed by the instanton effective action (6.55). Since each insertion\ncan saturate the integrals over two Grassmann collective coordinates, the dominant contribution to the\nintegral comes from a region where one of the k instantons lies in the vicinity of each of the k insertion\npoints. Choosing the insertion points in this way selects a region of Mk in which the k instanton\nconfiguration is completely clustered, as described in \u00a7II.4.3. So to leading order we can ignore any\ninteractions between them. The collective coordinate integration measure then clusters as in (3.25).\nThe factor of 1\/k! is then cancelled by the k! ways of pairing the k instantons and k insertion points.\nHence, to leading order, for these large separations we have\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 g2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2(x(k))\n\u232a\nk-inst\n=\n\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\ntrN\u03bb\n2\n\u232ak\n1-inst\n. (7.81)\nBut we have proved in \u00a7VII.1 that the correlation functions are independent of the insertion points and\nso (7.81) is an exact statement.\nNow that we have established that the SCI approach is inconsistent with clustering it is appropriate\nfor us to make some comments regarding this methodology. The usual justification put forward for this\nmethod can be paraphrased as follows [10, 38, 63]. The correlation functions of trN \u03bb\n2 are independent\nof the insertion points and so we can consider the configuration where the insertions are very close\ncompared with the scale of strong coupling effects \u039b. In this case only small instanton configurations\nshould contribute to the integral over the instanton moduli space. If this is true then we should be\nable in invoke asymptotic freedom, namely the fact that the integral over the instanton moduli space\ninvolves the the instanton action factor exp(\u22128\u03c02\/g2), where g runs with the characteristic scale size\nof the instanton, to argue that the calculation is reliable for insertions which are arbitrarily close.\n116\nThe fact that the correlation functions are independent of the insertions then allows us to continue\nto large separations. Unfortunately this argument is potentially flawed because, as in is clear from\n(7.21), the integral over the instanton scale size is not cut-off exponentially by the separations between\nthe insertions but only by a power law and so large instantons are not adequately suppressed. This\nbehaviour should at least question the use of asymptotic freedom as an argument for exactness.\nAlthough we have only chosen to discuss the gluino condensate the analysis can be generalized to\nany correlation function involving gauge-invariant lowest-components of chiral superfields. For example,\nin the theories with fundamental hypermultiplets, the gauge invariant composite q\u02dcfqf \u2032 is also gauge\ninvariant and the lowest component of a chiral superfield. So correlation functions of this insertion,\nalong with g2trN\u03bb\n2 will, by the Ward identity, be independent of the insertion points and holomorphic\nin the couplings. The SCI verses WCI mismatch that we have witnessed for the gluino condensate\nextends to these correlation functions and the same conclusion applies: only the WCI approaches are\nreliable. The mismatch is particularly striking in the theory with NF = N \u2212 1 hypermultiplets.

In the SCI\nmethodology one takes the Higgs to be zero in the bare theory so that the instantons are not constrained.\nVEVs for the scalar fields then arise from instanton effects. On the contrary, in the WCI methodology\nthe Higgs VEV is included in the bare theory and the instantons are constrained. The SCI approach\nyields the result [10]\nGSCI =\n\u039b2N+1\n(N\u22121)\nN !\n\u01eb{fl},{f \u2032l} , (7.83)\nwhere \u01eb{fl},{f \u2032l} equals 1 if all the fl are distinct and {fl} \u2261 {f \u2032l}, otherwise it is 0. The WCI result is\nvery easy to establish given the calculation of\n\u2329\ng2\n16\u03c02\n\u03bb2\n\u232a\nin \u00a7VII.2.2. This is because the insertions of\nthe matter fields can be replaced by their VEVs q\u02dcfqf \u2032 \u2192 v\u02dcfvf\u03b4ff \u2032 . Multiplying (7.34) by the product\nof VEVs one finds\nGWCI = \u039b2N+1(N\u22121)\nN\u22121\u220f\nl=1\n\u03b4flf \u2032l . (7.84)\nWhat makes the mismatch between (7.83) and (7.84) particularly striking is that the integral over the\ncollective coordinates that yields the WCI result is formally just the limit of the SCI integral with the\nVEVs set to zero: vf = v\u02dcf = 0 as emphasized in the context of gauge group SU(2) in Ref. [76]. So the\ncollective coordinate integral is discontinuous at this point. These considerations show that the SCI\napproach yields an incorrect result even when applied in a weakly-coupled Higgs phase.\n117\nVIII On the Coulomb Branch of N = 2 Gauge Theories\nTheories with N = 2 supersymmetry have an adjoint-valued scalar field and consequently a Coulomb\nbranch where the gauge symmetry is broken to the maximal abelian subgroup. For large values of the\nVEVs the theory is weakly-coupled and constrained instanton methods should be reliable. Moreover\ncertain holomorphic quantities, and in particular the prepotential described below, are protected against\nquantum corrections (beyond one-loop) and leading-order semi-classical methods should be exact. On\nthe Coulomb branch of an N = 2 theory there is a completely different approach to calculating the\nprepotential based on the theory of Seiberg and Witten [68, 77]. This remarkable theory predicts in\na rather implicit way the exact form of the prepotential which can then be expanded in the semi-\nclassical regime yielding the sum of a tree-level and one-loop contribution plus a series of instanton\nterms of arbitrary charge. In general closed-form expressions for higher instanton numbers are not\nknown, however what has been established are recursion relations which give the higher instanton\ncoefficients, in terms of those of lower instanton number. The situation gives us an unprecedented\nlaboratory for testing semi-classical instanton methods and all that entails: imaginary-time formalism,\nEuclidean path integral, etc. Actually the result cuts both ways: not only can we quantitatively test\nsemi-classical instanton methods in gauge theory, but, in addition, we can subject the ingenious theory\nof Seiberg Witten to stringent tests.56\nAfter introducing the notion of the low-energy effective action and the prepotential, we then go on\nto show how the instanton contributions at each instanton number are the centred instanton partition\nfunction introduced in \u00a7VI.5. We then go on to describe the explicit evaluation of this partition function\nfor the particular case of gauge group SU(2) with NF flavours of hypermultiplets in the fundamental\nrepresentation for instanton number k = 1 and k = 2. This calculation relies on the fact that the gauge\ngroup SU(2) is also Sp(1) and the ADHM construction based on Sp(N), for N = 1, is more economical\nthan that for SU(N), for N = 2. We then present the one-instanton calculation for general unitary\ngroups. The results we obtain are in precise agreement with Seiberg-Witten theory for any number of\nflavours. Nevertheless, the cases with NF = 2N are rather special since there are non-trivial dictionary\nissues to resolve.\nWe shall conclude this overture with a brief guide to literature which studied instanton effects in\nSeiberg-Witten models. First instanton tests of pure N = 2 supersymmetric SU(2) theories were per-\nformed in [54] at a one-instanton level and in [25] at a two-instanton level. Two-instanton contributions\nto the prepotential in SU(2) theories with NF fundamental hypermultiplets were calculated in [48,61,78]\nand the general expression for the k-instanton contribution to the prepotential as an integral over the\nADHM moduli space was derived in [48]. The relation of Matone [80] between the prepotential and the\ncondensate u2 in SU(2) was tested at a two-instanton level in [81] and derived to all orders in instan-\ntons in [82]. SU(N) gauge theories with and without matter fields were studied at one-instanton level\nin [20,83,84]. In all these cases exact results of Seiberg-Witten and their generalizations [85\u201390] for the\nlow-energy effective action were reproduced exactly for NF < 2N . The case of NF = 2N was considered\n56We take it as unreasonably perverse that the instanton calculus and Seiberg-Witten theory could both be wrong\nwhile being consistent with one another. In any case there are other tests of Seiberg-Witten theory based, for example,\non the spectrum of BPS states [79].\n118\nin [20,91] where it was pointed out that the mismatch between instanton calculations and the proposed\nexact solutions for NF = 2N arises due to a finite (perturbative and non-perturbative) renormalization\nof the coupling constant of the low-energy effective theory. This effect has to be incorporated into\nexact solutions which then agree with instanton results. For a recent careful treatment of these issues\nsee [92]. In addition to these effects, explicit instanton calculations are also necessary in order to fix the\ndictionary between the quantum moduli used in constructing exact solutions and the gauge-invariant\nVEVs un, see [20, 58, 61, 84, 91\u201394] for more detail. A completely new technique for evaluating the in-\nstanton contributions to the prepotential has been pioneered in [95,96] leading to the first calculations\nof instanton effects for all instanton number (beyond the large-N calculations reported in Chapters VII\nand IX) and the first test of Seiberg-Witten theory to all orders in the instanton expansion. We will\nbriefly describe this new formalism in \u00a7XI.2.\nVIII.1 Seiberg-Witten theory and the prepotential\nTheories with N = 2 supersymmetry and gauge group SU(N) on the Coulomb branch have an N \u2212 1\ncomplex dimensional vacuum moduli space parameterized by the VEVs (4.63) for the complex scalar\nfield \u03c6. At a generic point on this classical moduli space the gauge group is broken to its maximal\nabelian subgroup U(1)N\u22121 \u2282 SU(N) and the theory is in a Coulomb phase. In these circumstances it is\npossible to describe the long-distance behaviour of the theory in terms of a low-energy effective action.\nThis can be written in terms of abelian N = 1 superfields57 W\u03b1u = (Amu, \u03bbu) and \u03a6u = (\u03c6u, \u03c8u):\nSeff =\n1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\nd4x Im\n{\n1\n2\n\u03c4uv(\u03a6)W\n\u03b1\nuW\u03b1v\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b82\n+ \u03a6Du(\u03a6) \u03a6\n\u2020\nu\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b82\u03b8\u00af2\n}\n. (8.1)\nwhere the VEVs of the scalar components of \u03a6u are identified with g\u03c6\n0\nu\/\n\u221a\n2 of the field of the microscopic\ntheory. This low-energy effective action is uniquely determined by the holomorphic prepotential F(\u03a6)\n[68] as\n\u03a6Du \u2261 \u2202F\n\u2202\u03a6u\n, \u03c4uv \u2261 \u2202\n2F\n\u2202\u03a6u\u2202\u03a6v\n. (8.2)\nEquation (8.1) implies that the matrix of complexified coupling constants of the low-energy U(1)N\u22121\ntheory has components \u03c4uv that depend on the scalar VEVs.\nThe electric-magnetic duality of the U(1)N\u22121 theory, uncovered by Seiberg and Witten [68, 77],\nidentifies \u03a6Du with the magnetic dual of the original (electric) matter superfield \u03a6u. The vacuum\nexpectation values of the scalar component of \u03a6Du are g\u03c6\n0\nDu\/\n\u221a\n2, with\n\u2211N\nu=1 \u03c6\n0\nDu = 0, which provide an\nalternative parameterization of the vacuum moduli space. Both parameterizations, {\u03c60u} and {\u03c60Du},\nare not valid globally on the moduli space. Such a global parameterization is provided [68, 77] by the\ngauge-invariant condensates {un} n = 2, . . . , N :\nun = 2\n\u2212n\/2gn \u3008trN \u03c6n\u3009 . (8.3)\nOn a patch of the moduli space where {\u03c60u} are a local coordinate system we have \u03c60u = \u03c60u(un) while on\nthe patch where the dual variables {\u03c60Du} are a local coordinate system we have \u03c60Du = \u03c60Du(un). The\n57For each of these superfields we have the traceless condition\n\u2211N\nu=1 W\u03b1u =\n\u2211N\nu=1 \u03a6u = 0.\n119\nanalysis of Seiberg and Witten [68, 77], and its generalizations, explicitly determine these functions in\nterms of an auxiliary Riemann surface defined by a family of hyper-elliptic curves.\nThe effective action specifies the long-range behaviour, compared with the scale 1\/(g\u03c60), of a series\nof correlation functions. In particular, we will focus on a four-point anti-chiral fermion correlator which\ninvolves the fourth derivative of the prepotential.

(8.5)\nThe restrictions imposed by holomorphy, renormalization group invariance and the anomaly imply\nthat the prepotential has a weak coupling expansion consisting of perturbative piece that is one-loop\nexact and a sum over instanton contributions which are exact to leading order in the semi-classical\nexpansion.

(8.7)\nIn general, the coefficients Fk depend on the VEVs and hypermultiplet masses.\nThe theory of Seiberg and Witten, extended from the original setting for SU(2) [68], to SU(N),\nN > 2, in Refs. [85\u201389], determines the exact form of the prepotential and in particular the k-instanton\ncoefficients Fk. The construction involves an auxiliary algebraic curve, or Riemann surface, the Seiberg-\nWitten curve.58 Once the curve has been identified, the coefficients can, in principle, be extracted.\nIn particular, explicit expression for low instanton number have been found in this way [83, 90]. For\narbitrary instanton number, explicit expressions are hard to obtain, however, recursion relations have\nbeen established that relate instanton contributions at charge k to those of lower charge [80, 97\u2013100].\nThese recursion relations are only valid in the asymptotically-free theories with NF < 2N . The finite\ntheory with NF = 2N is rather special since there are various re-definitions of the physical quantities\nthat have to be taken into account: see Ref. [92].\n58In a nut-shell, the matrix of coupling \u03c4uv is identified with the period matrix of the curve in a suitable basis.\n120\nHere, we use the notation of [90] to write down the k = 1 and k = 2 contributions for NF < 2N :\nF1 =\nN\u2211\nu=1\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu) , (8.8a)\nF2 =\nN\u2211\nu,v=1\n(u 6=v)\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu)Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n(\u03c60u \u2212 \u03c60v)2\n+ 1\n4\nN\u2211\nu=1\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n\u22022Su(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n\u2202(\u03c60u)\n2\n, (8.8b)\nwhere we have used the function\nSu(x) \u2261\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n(x\u2212 \u03c60v)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + x) . (8.9)\nVIII.2 Extracting the prepotential from instantons\nThere are two distinct\u2014but ultimately equivalent\u2014ways of determining the instanton contributions\nto the prepotential. The first involves calculating the leading semi-classical contribution to Green\u2019s\nfunctions whose long-distance limit can be matched with the low-energy effective action (8.1). Here,\nwe will concentrate on the four-point anti-chiral fermion correlator (8.4) which involves the fourth\nderivative of the prepotential. However, other correlators which we do not consider explicitly determine\nthe second derivative of the prepotential in an analogous way. The second approach involves calculating\nthe instanton contribution to the condensate u2 defined in (8.3) and then relating this to the prepotential\nby use of a renormalization group equation which yields the derivative of the prepotential with respect\nto log \u039b (for NF < 2N) [80,101\u2013103]. Alternatively, we will take the view that the instanton calculation\nof the condensate provides an independent way to establish the renormalization group relation.\nFor the first approach we turn our focus to the instanton contributions to the four-point anti-chiral\nfermion correlator (8.4). The first point to make is that since there are non-trivial scalar VEVs the\ninstantons are constrained as described in \u00a7IV.4.1. It will transpire that the integral over the 4-vector\nX in (8.4) arises in the instanton context from the integral over the centre of the instanton (2.82).\nConsequently, in order to extract the long-distance behaviour of the correlator we should insert the\ncorresponding behaviour of the anti-chiral fermions \u03bb\u00afA = (\u03bb\u00af, \u03c8\u00af) far from the core of the constrained\ninstanton. Recall from our discussion in \u00a7IV.4.1, that in the tail of the constrained instanton fields decay\nexponentially except for the components which remain massless after the Higgs mechanism. These are\nthe fields valued in the U(1)N\u22121 subgroup picked out by the VEV \u03c60; in other words the diagonal\nelements of the N \u00d7 N matrices \u03bb\u00afA. It is precisely these components of the anti-chiral fermions that\nwe need in order calculate the long-distance behaviour of the correlator. This is fortunate because, as\nwe argued in \u00a7IV.4.1, to leading order in the semi-classical expansion these massless components are\nsimply given by their ADHM expressions. Moreover, we will only need the components of the anti-\nchiral fermions that depend on the four supersymmetric Grassmann collective coordinates \u03beA (4.43),\nsince these are the only Grassmann variables whose integrals are not saturated by the instanton effective\naction (6.84). It will turn out that each insertion of \u03bb\u00afA is then linear in \u03be\nB and therefore the insertion\nof the four anti-chiral fermions precisely saturates the integrals over the four Grassmann variables\n121\nassociated to the unlifted supersymmetric zero modes. In principle, we can extract the terms that we\nneed from the solution for the anti-chiral fermions in (4.62) (with \u03c8\u00afA given in (C.38) and (C.39a)-\n(C.39c)). However, it more straightforward to use the sweeping-out procedure described in \u00a7IV.3. The\nsupersymmetry transformation (4.23c) (re-scaled by g1\/2) in the super-instanton background gives the\nrequired dependence on \u03beA:\n\u03bb\u00afA = \u2212ig1\/2\u03a3\u00afaAB \/\u00afD\u03c6a\u03beB = \u2212g1\/2 \/\u00afD\u03c6\u2020\u03beA , (8.10)\nwhere in the latter expression we used the relations (4.20). The expression for the anti-holomorphic\ncomponent of the scalar field is given in (6.66) (it is important to remember that in an instanton\nbackground \u03c6\u2020 is not the conjugate of \u03c6). We then expand the diagonal components of \/\u00afD\u03c6\u2020 (these are\nthe massless components) for large distances from the instanton core using the asymptotic formulae in\n\u00a7II.4.3:\n( \/\u00afD\u03c6\u2020)uu = \u2212 \/\u00af\u2202 1\n(x\u2212X)2wu\u03b1\u02d9\n{\n\u03c60\u2020u 1[k]\u00d7[k] +L\n\u22121\n(\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\u03c60\u2020w\u03b2\u02d9 \u2212 14\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nKfK\u02dcf\n)}\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9u . (8.11)\nPlugging this into (8.10), and using the form of the instanton effective action (6.84), we are able to\nestablish the following simple relation between the long-distance behaviour of the anti-chiral fermion\nand the instanton effective action:59\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9Au = 2\n\u221a\ng S\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1(x,X)\u01ebAB\u03be\nA\n\u03b1\n\u2202S\u02dc\n\u2202\u03c60u\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (8.12)\nThe ellipsis represent terms depending on other Grassmann collective coordinate which will not be\nrequired to determine the long-range behaviour of the correlator in question.\nThe k-instanton contribution to the correlation function (8.4) is evaluated in the usual way by\nmaking insertions of the long-distance component (8.12) into the collective coordinate integral:\u2329\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9u1(x1)\u03bb\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\nu2(x2)\u03c8\u00af\n\u03b3\u02d9\nu3(x3)\u03c8\u00af\n\u03b4\u02d9\nu4(x4)\n\u232a\nk\n=\n(\n\u00b5\ng\n)k(2N\u2212NF )\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF ) e\u2212S\u02dc \u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9u1(x\n(1))\u03bb\u00af\u03b2\u02d9u2(x\n(2))\u03c8\u00af\u03b3\u02d9u3(x\n(3))\u03c8\u00af\u03b4\u02d9u4(x\n(4)) .\n(8.13)\nHere, \u03c9(N=2,NF ) is the supersymmetric volume form on the instanton moduli space in a theory with NF\nhypermultiplets defined in (5.55) and (6.59). The instanton effective action S\u02dc is precisely (6.84) along\nwith the hypermultiplet mass term (6.87). Following [48, 82], we substitute the expression (8.12) into\nthe right-hand side and perform the integrals over the four supersymmetric Grassmann variables \u03beA.\nThis leaves \u2329\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9(x(1))\u03bb\u00af\u03b2\u02d9(x(2))\u03c8\u00af\u03b3\u02d9(x(3))\u03c8\u00af\u03b4\u02d9(x4)\n\u232a\nk\n=\n1\n4\u03c02\ng2\n(\n\u00b5\ng\n)k(2N\u2212NF )\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u22024\n\u2202\u03c60u1\u2202\u03c6\n0\nu2\u2202\u03c6\n0\nu3\u2202\u03c6\n0\nu4\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF ) e\u2212S\u02dc\n\u00d7\n\u222b\nd4X S\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1(x(1), X)S\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1(x\n(2), X)S\u00af\u03b3\u02d9\u03b3(x(3), X)S\u00af\u03b4\u02d9\u03b3(x\n(4), X) .\n(8.14)\n59Here, \u03bb\u00afu \u2261 (\u03bb\u00af)uu the diagonal elements of \u03bb\u00af.\n122\nThe integral over the centred moduli space M\u0302k is precisely the centred instanton partition function\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk defined in (6.103). Note in (8.14) the linearity of S\u02dc in \u03c6\n0\nu, apparent in (6.84), has been used\nto pull the \u03c60u derivatives outside the collective coordinate integral.\nComparing the semi-classical expression (8.14) with its exact counterpart (8.4), we deduce the\nfollowing expression for the k-instanton expansion coefficient of the prepotential in (8.6):\nFk = g\u2212k(2N\u2212NF )+2Z\u0302(N=2,NF )k . (8.15)\nOne might have thought that we could add to this relation any function whose fourth derivative with\nrespect to the VEVs vanishes. Actually, by considering other correlators, one can establish (8.15) up\nto functions whose second derivative with respect to the VEVs vanishes. However, since there are no\npossible linear functions of the VEVs, (8.15) must be true up to an undetermined constant which does\nnot affect the physics because the low-energy effective action only depends on derivatives of F . Note\nthat in order to write the instanton contributions in the form (8.6) we have substituted the expression\nfor the \u039b-parameter of the theory in terms of the running coupling:\n\u039b2N\u2212NF\n(NF )\n\u2261 \u00b52N\u2212NF e2\u03c0i\u03c4 . (8.16)\nFor the special case when Nf = 2N , where the \u03b2-function vanishes, the factor \u039b\n2N\u2212NF\n(NF )\nshould be\nreplaced by q = e2i\u03c0\u03c4 .\nThe other way to calculate the instanton expansion of the prepotential is to use the renormalization\ngroup equation for the prepotential first established by Matone in the context of pure SU(2) theory [80]\nand then generalized to SU(N) in Refs. [101\u2013103]. Rather than write down the relevant equation we\nshall proceed to prove a version of the renormalization group equation using the instanton calculus,\ngeneralizing the SU(2) calculation of [82]. One may then check that our instanton version is consistent\nwith those in the literature cited above. Our relation will also be valid in the finite theory where\nNF = 2N . The approach is rather different from that just follows. Instead of calculating the instanton\ncontribution to the long-range behaviour of a correlator, one calculates the instanton contributions to\nthe condensate u2.\nTo begin, we establish the form of the insertion trN \u03c6\n2 in the constrained instanton background.\nJust as in the calculation of the gluino condensate in the N = 1 theories in the Higgs phase described\nin \u00a7VII.2.2 and \u00a7VII.3.2, to leading order we may replace the insertion by its value in the unconstrained\nADHM instanton background. This is because any error incurred is necessarily of a higher order in\ng. Just as for the 4-point anti-chiral fermion correlator (8.4), the insertion must saturate the integrals\nover the four supersymmetric Grassmann variables \u03beA. Since, as is evident from (4.64), the scalar\nfield is quadratic in the Grassmann collective coordinates so the composite trN \u03c6\n2 is indeed quartic in\nthe Grassmann collective coordinates. The dependence on \u03beA may be obtained by the sweeping out\nprocedure using the supersymmetry transformation (4.23d):\n\u03c6a = \u221212g\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03beA\u03c3mn\u03beBFmn + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (8.17)\nTherefore, using (4.20), \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u2212 i\u03c62, and the identity\n\u03be\u03c3mn\u03b7 \u03be\u03c3pq\u03b7 = \u221218(\u03be\u03be)(\u03b7\u03b7) , (8.18)\n123\nfor arbitrary spinors \u03be and \u03b7, we have\n1\n2\ng2trN \u03c6\n2(x) = 1\n2\ng4(\u03be1\u03be1)(\u03be2\u03be2)trN F\n2\nmn(x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (8.19)\nWe now insert (8.19) into the collective coordinate integral. Separating out the variables {X, \u03beA} as in\n(6.102) one can then trivially integrate over the Grassmann variables \u03beA. The integral over the 4-vector\nX is also trivial because by translational symmetry it may be traded for an integral over the insertion\npoint x yielding\n\u222b\nd4x trNF\n2\nmn(x) which is the integral that gives the instanton charge (2.2). Hence, the\nk-instanton contribution to the condensate is\nu2\n\u2223\u2223\nk\n= k\u039b\nk(2N\u2212NF )\n(NF )\ng\u2212k(2N\u2212NF )+2 Z\u0302(N=2,NF )k . (8.20)\nNotice that the instanton contribution to the condensate u2 is proportional to the centred instanton\npartition function just as for the expression for the gluino condensate (7.25) in the N = 1 theory. Of\ncourse in the N = 2 theory the condensate receives contributions from all instanton numbers whereas\none can easily show that in the N = 1 theory the centred instanton partition function vanishes for\nk > 1.\nComparing (8.20) with our formula for the prepotential (8.24) we obtain a version of the renor-\nmalization group equation in the form of Ref. [82]. The result is most easy to state in terms of the\nk-instanton contribution:\nu2\n\u2223\u2223\nk\n= k\u039bk(2N\u2212NF )Fk . (8.21)\nThis expression relates only the non-perturbative contributions to both quantities. The rest, however,\nis easy to determine via direct perturbative calculation. In addition to instantons, the prepotential\nreceives only 1-loop perturbative contributions, while u2 receives no perturbative corrections to its\nclassical value. It is remarkable that we were able to derive (8.21) using instanton calculus, but without\nactually having to integrate over the instanton moduli space. Note that the result is equally valid in\nthe finite theory NF = 2N on replacing \u039b\n2N\u2212NF \u2192 e2\u03c0i\u03c4 and it is also valid for arbitrary hypermultiplet\nmasses.\nAt this point we find it useful to perform various re-scalings of the variables by powers of the coupling\ng in order that there are is no explicit g dependence in Z\u0302k. The required re-scalings are\n\u03c60 \u2192 g\u22121\u03c60 , a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 ga\u03b1\u02d9 , MA \u2192 g1\/2MA , K \u2192 g1\/2K , K\u02dc \u2192 g1\/2K\u02dc . (8.22)\nUnder these re-scalings, the centred instanton partition function scales as\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk \u2192 gk(2N\u2212NF )+2Z\u0302(N=2,NF )k . (8.23)\nIn particular there is no g dependence in the re-scaled instanton effective action action and the re-scaled\nversion of (8.15) is simply\nFk = Z\u0302(N=2,NF )k , (8.24)\nwhere all g dependence has disappeared (as it should).\n124\nVIII.3 Gauge group SU(2)\nIn this section, we specialize to gauge group SU(2) and compute the one and two instanton contributions\nto the prepotential in order to compare with the exact theory of Seiberg and Witten. For SU(2), there\nis a single VEV \u03c60 \u2261 \u03c601\/2 = \u2212\u03c602\/2. The predictions for the one- and two-instanton coefficients are\nobtained from (8.8a) by setting N = 2.\nSince the gauge group SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1) one can proceed with either of the two formalisms;\nhowever, as described in \u00a7VI.2, the ADHM construction for Sp(1) is more economical in the sense that\nfor a given k their are fewer ADHM variables and constraints compared with the SU(2) formalism.\nHence, the Sp(1) formalism is better suited for a direct calculation of the prepotential.\nAlmost all of the formulae that we established in the SU(N) instanton calculus case carry over to\nSp(1) by simply imposing the extra restrictions (6.32) and (6.33) on a\u03b1\u02d9 and MA, respectively. Recall,\nonce we have replaced the gauge index u = 1, 2 by a spinor index \u03b1 = 1, 2, the ADHM variables w\u03b1\u02d9ui\nbecome quaternions w\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9i. From (6.36)\na =\n(\nw\na\u2032\n)\n, (8.25)\nwhere w is a k-vector of quaternions and a\u2032 is a k\u00d7k symmetric matrix whose elements are quaternions.\nIn (8.25) and in much of the following the quaternion indices are understood. Products of quaternions\nare defined as 2\u00d7 2 matrix multiplication. We also define the quaternion inner product\nx \u00b7 y = 1\n4\ntr2(x\u00afy + y\u00afx) , |x|2 \u2261 x \u00b7 x = xnxn . (8.26)\nFor the Grassmann collective coordinates\nMA =\n(\n\u00b5A\nM\u2032A\n)\n, (8.27)\nfor A = 1, 2, where \u00b5A and M\u2032A are Weyl spinor-valued k-vectors and k \u00d7 k symmetric matrices,\nrespectively.\nThe collective coordinate integral will involve the volume form on the instanton moduli space which\nis given by an obvious translation of the general SU(N) formula (5.55):\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N=2) =\nC(N=2)k\nVolO(k)\n\u222b k\u220f\ni=1\nd4wi\n\u220f\ni\u2264j\nd4a\u2032ij\n{ 2\u220f\nA=1\nk\u220f\ni=1\nd2\u00b5Ai\nk\u220f\ni\u2264j=1\nd2MAij\n}\n\u00d7 \u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u2223\u22121 k\u220f\ni<j=1\n{ 3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n2\ntrk \u03c4\nc\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9((a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9)ij \u2212 (a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9)ji)\n) 2\u220f\nA=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\n(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9)ij \u2212 (M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9)ji\n)}\n.\n(8.28)\nIn this expression, integrals over a quaternion w are defined as\n\u222b\nd4w \u2261 \u222b dw1 dw2 dw3 dw4. Note in\nthe one-instanton sector the \u03b4-functions are absent (unlike the SU(2) formalism). In this formalism L\nis now a linear operator on the space of k \u00d7 k antisymmetric matrices but still defined as in (2.125).\nFinally, the normalization constant is fixed by using clustering and comparison with the one-instanton\ncollective coordinate integral in [2]:\nC(N=2)k = 2\n5k\u2212k2\u03c0\u22124k . (8.29)\n125\nThe leading order expression for the instanton effective action of the N = 2 theory with NF funda-\nmental hypermultiplets can be read of the expression in the SU(N) theory (6.84). In addition, we add\nthe mass terms (6.87). The collective coordinate integral also includes integrals over the hypermultiplet\ncollective coordinates {K, K\u02dc} in (6.58). Consider the complete expression for the collective coordinate\nintegral in the chiral limit, mf = 0. In this limit, for fixed flavor index f , the Grassmann measure (6.58)\nis obviously even or odd under the discrete symmetry\nKif \u2194 K\u02dcfi , (8.30)\ndepending on whether k itself is even or odd. On the other hand, the instanton effective action (6.84)\n(without the mass terms) is always even under this symmetry. Therefore, for NF > 0, only the even-\ninstanton sectors k = 0, 2, . . . can contribute in the chiral limit60 (recall that when NF = 0 all instanton\nnumbers contribute). This selection rule was already noted by Seiberg and Witten in Sec. 3 of [77] so it\nis satisfying to see it arising naturally in the instanton calculus. Of course it is violated once the masses\nare non-zero, since KifK\u02dcfi is odd under the symmetry.\nVIII.3.1 One instanton\nRecall that in order to calculate instanton contributions to the prepotential we have to calculate the\ncentred instanton partition function (8.24). We begin with the one-instanton case. In ADHM language,\nthe bosonic and fermionic parameters of a single N = 2 super-instanton are contained in three 2 \u00d7 1\nmatrices of unconstrained parameters:\na =\n(\nw\n\u2212X\n)\n, MA =\n(\n\u00b5A\n\u22124i\u03beA\n)\n. (8.31)\nIn addition, there are 2NF Grassmann variables {Kf , K\u02dcf} which parameterize the fundamental zero\nmodes. The centred-instanton volume form is extracted from (8.28):\u222b\nM\u03021\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF ) =\n23\n\u03c04+2NF\n\u222b\nd4w\n2\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u00b5A\nNF\u220f\nf=1\ndKf dK\u02dcf , (8.32)\nwhere the instanton effective action for k = 1 is easily deduce from (6.84) and (6.87):\nS\u02dc = 8\u03c02|w|2|\u03c60|2 \u2212 2i\u03c02\u00b5A\u03c60\u2020\u00b5A + \u03c02\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nmfKfK\u02dcf . (8.33)\nNotice that the only dependence on Kf and K\u02dcf comes exclusively from the mass term at the one-\ninstanton level. The corresponding Grassmann integrations are easily saturated by bringing down\nappropriate powers of this term from the exponent. As expected from the discrete symmetry (8.30),\nthe result is non-zero only when all the mf are non-vanishing. The remaining integrals are easily\nperformed, yielding\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\n1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nN=2\n=\n2\n(\u03c60)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\nmf . (8.34)\n60The absence of a one-instanton contribution is quite easy to see since {Kf , K\u02dcf} completely decouple from the instanton\neffective action (6.84) and consequently their integrals remain unsaturated.\n126\nUsing (8.24), this gives F1 which is in agreement with (8.8a) for NF < 4, up to irrelevant VEV-\nindependent constants for the cases NF = 2, 3.\nVIII.3.2 Two instantons\nNext we turn to the more calculationally intensive 2-instanton contribution. The parameters of the\nk = 2 ADHM super-instanton are contained in the following 3\u00d7 2 matrices:\na =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed w1 w2\u2212X + a3 a1\na1 \u2212X \u2212 a3\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , MA =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u00b5A1 \u00b5A2\u22124i\u03beA +M\u2032A3 M\u2032A1\nM\u2032A1 \u22124i\u03beA \u2212M\u2032A3\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (8.35)\nEach element of a is a quaternion and ofMA a Weyl spinor. In addition, there are now 4NF fundamental\nzero modes parameterized by the Grassmann numbers Kif and K\u02dcfi. We also define the following\nfrequently occurring combinations of these collective coordinates:\nL = |w1|2 + |w2|2 , H = |w1|2 + |w2|2 + 4|a1|2 + 4|a3|2 ,\n\u2126 = w1w\u00af2 \u2212 w2w\u00af1 , \u03c9 = 12\u03c60tr2\n(\nw\u00af2\u03c4\n3w1 \u2212 w\u00af1\u03c4 3w2\n)\n,\nY = \u2212\u00b5A1 \u00b52A \u2212 2M\u2032A3 M\u20321A , Z =\nNF\u2211\nf=1\n(K1fK\u02dcf2 \u2212K2fK\u02dcf1) . (8.36)\nFor k = 2 L is just multiplication by the quantity H . In terms of these variables the instanton effective\naction (6.84) (with the mass term (6.87) and re-scalings (8.22)) is written\nS\u02dc = 8\u03c02L|\u03c60|2 \u2212 2\u03c02i\u03c60\u2020(\u00b5A1 \u00b51A \u2212 \u00b5A2 \u00b52A)\n\u2212 8\u03c0\n2\nH\n(\n\u03c9\u00af \u2212 1\n8\nZ\n)(\n\u03c9 \u2212 i\n2\nY\n)\n+ \u03c02\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nmf\n(K1f K\u02dcf1 +K2fK\u02dcf2) . (8.37)\nWe can now proceed to evaluate the centred instanton partition function. To start with, we can\nexplicitly solve the bosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints. This is conveniently done by eliminating\nthe off-diagonal elements a1 and M\u2032A1 , as follows:\na1 =\n1\n4|a3|2 a3(w\u00af2w1 \u2212 w\u00af1w2) , M\n\u2032A\n1 =\n1\n2|a3|2 a3\n(\n2a\u00af1M\u2032A3 + w\u00af2\u00b5A1 \u2212 w\u00af1\u00b5A2\n)\n, . (8.38)\nWe can now explicitly integrate out the \u03b4-functions in the expression for the centred k = 2 instanton\nvolume form (8.28):\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N=2) =\nC(N=2)2\n210\n\u222b\nd4a\u20321 d\n4w1 d\n4w2\n{ 2\u220f\nA=1\nd2M\u2032A3 d2\u00b5A1 d2\u00b5A2\n} \u2223\u2223|a3|2 \u2212 |a1|2\u2223\u2223\nH\n. (8.39)\nThe bosonic parts of the 2-instanton collective coordinate integral was originally derived in Refs. [8,\n104, 105] by directly changing variables in the path integral.\n127\nWe now have a series of integrals to perform. First of all, performing the Grassmann integrals over\nthe parameters of the adjoint zero modes gives [48]\u222b { 2\u220f\nA=1\nd2M\u2032A3 d2\u00b5A1 d2\u00b5A2\n}\nexp\n{\n2\u03c02i\n(\n\u03c60\u2020(\u00b5A1 \u00b51A \u2212 \u00b5A2 \u00b52A) +\nY\nH\n(\n\u03c9\u00af \u2212 1\n8\nZ\n))}\n= \u2212\n(\n16\u03c06(\u03c9\u00af \u2212 1\n8\nZ)\n|a3|2H\n)2 {\n2\u22128(\u03c60\u2020)4|\u2126|2 + L\n8H\n(\u03c60)\u20202(\u03c9\u00af \u2212 1\n8\nZ)\u03c9\u00af\n+ 1\n4\nH\u22122(\u03c9\u00af \u2212 1\n8\nZ)2\n(\n1\n4\n(\u03c60\u2020)2(L2 \u2212 |\u2126|2) + \u03c9\u00af2)} .\n(8.40)\nThis is the generalization to NF > 0 of the Yukawa determinant given in Eq. (8.13) of [25]. The next\nstep is to integrate over the Grassmann collective coordinates {K, K\u02dc} using the identity\u222b\nd2NFK d2NF K\u02dcG(Z) exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03c02\nNF\u2211\nf=1\nmf\n(K1f K\u02dcf1 +K2f K\u02dcf2))\n=\nNF\u2211\nl=0\nM\n(NF )\nNF\u2212l\n\u03c04l\n\u22022lG\n\u2202Z2l\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nZ=0\n,\n(8.41)\nwhere\nM\n(NF )\nl\ndef\n=\nNF\u2211\nf1<f2<\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7<fl=1\nm2f1m\n2\nf2\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7m2fl (M\n(NF )\n0 = 1 , M\n(NF )\nl = 0 l < 0) . (8.42)\nFinally we turn to the remaining integration over the bosonic moduli. Following [25], it is convenient\nto change variables in the bosonic measure from {a3, w1, w2} to the new set {H,L,\u2126} defined in (8.36).\nThe relevant Jacobians are \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd4a3\n\u2223\u2223|a3|2 \u2212 |a1|2\u2223\u2223\n|a3|4 \u2212\u2192\n\u03c02\n2\n\u222b \u221e\nL+2|\u2126|\ndH , (8.43a)\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd4w1 d\n4w2 \u2212\u2192 \u03c0\n3\n8\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndL\n\u222b\n|\u2126|\u2264L\nd3\u2126 . (8.43b)\nThe numerator and denominator in the left-hand side of (8.43a) are supplied by (8.39) and (8.40),\nrespectively. In addition, we introduce re-scaled variables \u2126 = L\u2126\u2032, H = LH \u2032, and \u03c9 = L\u03c9\u2032. The\nintegral over L is now trivial. Finally we switch to spherical polar coordinates,\u222b\nd3\u2126\u2032 \u2212\u2192 2\u03c0\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\nd(cos \u03b8)\n\u222b 1\n0\n|\u2126\u2032|2d|\u2126\u2032| , (8.44)\nwhere the polar angle is defined by |\u03c9\u2032| = 1\n2\n|\u2126\u2032||\u03c60| cos \u03b8. This leaves an ordinary 3-dimensional integral\nover the remaining variablesH, cos \u03b8 and |\u2126\u2032| which is the precise analog of Eq. (8.19) in [25]. Performing\nthis integral with the help of a standard symbolic manipulation routine gives results which can be\nsummed up by the formula\nFk\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nN=2,NF\n=\n5\n(\u03c60)6\nM\n(NF )\nNF\n\u2212 3\n4(\u03c60)4\nM\n(NF )\nNF\u22121\n1\n16(\u03c60)2\nM\n(NF )\nNF\u22122 \u2212\n5\n2633\nM\n(NF )\nNF\u22123 +\n7(\u03c60)2\n2835\nM\n(NF )\nNF\u22124 , (8.45)\n128\nwhere the coefficients M\n(NF )\nl are defined in (8.42). For NF < 4 these expressions are identical to the\npredictions from the Seiberg-Witten curve (8.8b), up to a physically unimportant additive constant in\nthe case NF = 3.\nThe situation in the NF = 4 theory is rather more subtle. To our knowledge the two-instanton\nprediction from Seiberg-Witten theory with arbitrary hypermultiplet masses has not been determined\nin the literature. However, in the massless case ones expects that the prepotential is classically exact:\nin other words given by the first term in (8.7). The result (8.45) for NF = 4 with vanishes masses\nF2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nNF=4,mf=0\n=\n7(\u03c60)2\n2835\n(8.46)\nis obviously in contradiction to this. The resolution of this discrepancy is explained in Refs. [48, 91].\nThe point is that the Seiberg-Witten curve is parameterized by an effective coupling \u03c4eff rather than\nby the microscopic coupling \u03c4 . The two definitions differ by an infinite series of even-charge instanton\ncorrections:\n\u03c4eff = \u03c4 +\n\u2211\nk=2,4,...\ncke\n2\u03c0ik\u03c4 . (8.47)\nThe two-instanton computation above shows that\nc2 =\n1\ni\u03c0\n\u00b7 7\n2735\n. (8.48)\nVIII.4 One instanton prepotential in SU(N)\nIn this section we perform, following [20], the explicit evaluation of the centred instanton partition\nfunction for k = 1 in an theory with arbitrary gauge group SU(N). It is best to start from the\nlinearized formulation described in \u00a7VI.5. The instanton effective action for k = 1 is, from (6.96) (with\nfactors of g removed by the re-scalings (8.22)):\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02\n{ \u2223\u2223wu\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7+ \u03c60wu\u03b1\u02d9\u2223\u22232 + i2 \u00b5\u00afAu (\u00b5uA\u03c7\u2217 + \u03c60\u2217u \u00b5uA) + 14 NF\u2211\nf=1\nKfK\u02dcf (\u03c7\u2212mf )\n}\n+ S\u02dcL.m. , (8.49)\nwhere the Lagrange multiplier terms for the ADHM constraints are\nS\u02dcL.m. = \u22124i\u03c02\n{\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\n(\n\u00b5\u00afAuwu\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00afu\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5\nA\nu\n)\n+ ~D \u00b7 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\u03b2\u02d9uwu\u03b1\u02d9\n}\n.

(8.60)\nWe are now in a position to integrate out the Lagrange multipliers ~D.

(8.61)\nFinally, it only remains to integrate over \u03c7:\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk = \u2212\u03c0\u22121\n\u222b\nd2\u03c7\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03c7\u22172\nf1(\u03c7, \u03c7\n\u2217)f2(\u03c7) , (8.62)\n130\nwhere we have defined the two quantities\nf1(\u03c7, \u03c7\n\u2217) =\nN\u2211\nu=1\n\u03b1\u2217u\n\u03b1u\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n\u03b1\u22172v\n|\u03b1v|4 \u2212 |\u03b1u|4 , f2(\u03c7) =\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf \u2212 \u03c7) . (8.63)\nThe resulting integral over the \u03c7-plane can be evaluated by Stoke\u2019s Theorem. There are two kinds of\nboundary to consider: on the sphere at infinity and around the singularities of the integrand. First the\nsingularities. Contrary to appearances the integrand is completely regular at |\u03b1u|2 \u2212 |\u03b1v|2 due to the\ncancellation between the uth and vth terms in the sum. However, there are N singularities at \u03b1u = 0,\ni.e. \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c60u, following from the fact that for z = x+ iy\n\u2202\n\u2202z\u2217\n1\nz\n= \u03c0\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y) . (8.64)\nIntroducing polar coordinates in the vicinity of the point \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c60u, \u03b1u = rei\u03b8, we take a boundary in\nthe form of a small circle of radius r \u2192 0. The resulting contribution is then\nlim\nr\u21920\n1\n4\u03c0\n(\n2 + r\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n) \u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 e2i\u03b8f1(r, \u03b8)f2(re\ni\u03b8) . (8.65)\nApplying this formula in the vicinity of \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c60u we find a contribution to the centred instanton\npartition function of\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n(\u03c60u \u2212 \u03c60v)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nu) . (8.66)\nWe can determine the contribution from the sphere at infinity by once again introducing polar\ncoordinates. Then in a similar fashion to (8.65) the contribution is\n\u2212 lim\nr\u2192\u221e\n1\n4\u03c0\n(\n2 + r\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n)\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 e2i\u03b8f1(r, \u03b8)f2(re\ni\u03b8) . (8.67)\nIt is easy to establish the following asymptotic forms for large r\nf1(r, \u03b8) \u223c\ne\u22122iN\u03b8\nr2(N\u22121)\n, f2(re\ni\u03b8) \u223c eiNF \u03b8rNF . (8.68)\nThis means that the contribution from the sphere at infinity is only non-vanishing when NF \u2265 2(N\u22121),\ni.e. in the three cases NF = 2N \u22122, 2N \u22121, 2N . Taking into account the selection rule arising from the\nintegration over \u03b8, there are only two relevant terms in the asymptotic expansion of f1(r, \u03b8), namely\nf1(r, \u03b8) \u223c \u03b11\ne\u22122iN\u03b8\nr2(N\u22121)\n+ \u03b12\ne\u22122i(N+1)\u03b8\nr2N\nN\u2211\nu=1\n(\u03c60u)\n2 (8.69)\nwhere we have defined the two constants\n\u03b11 = 2\n3\u22122N\n(\n2N \u2212 3\nN \u2212 1\n)\n, \u03b12 = 2\n\u22122N\n(\n2N\nN \u2212 1\n)\n. (8.70)\n131\nAll other terms are either sub-leading in 1\/r or have the wrong \u03b8 dependence (taking account of the\nfact that f2 is a polynomial in e\ni\u03b8 along with the factor of e2i\u03b8 in (8.67)). Hence, the contribution to\nthe centred instanton partition function from the sphere at infinity is\nS(NF )k=1 = \u2212\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n0 NF < 2N \u2212 2 ,\n\u03b11 NF = 2N \u2212 2 ,\n\u03b11\n\u2211N\nf=1mf NF = 2N \u2212 1 ,\n\u03b11\n\u2211NF\nf,f \u2032=1\n(f<f \u2032)\nmfmf \u2032 + \u03b12\n\u2211N\nu=1(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n2 NF = 2N .\n(8.71)\nAll-in-all, the k = 1 contribution to the centred partition function, and hence the coefficient F1 of the\nprepotential, is the sum of (8.66) and (8.71):\nF1 \u2261 Z\u0302(N=2,NF )k =\nN\u2211\nu=1\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n(\u03c60v \u2212 \u03c60u)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nu) + S(NF )1 . (8.72)\nThis calculation illustrates the complexity of integrating over the instanton moduli space even at\nthe one instanton level. However, if one follows the method in detail an interesting intuitive picture\nemerges. First recall that the final integral over \u03c7 was evaluated by using Stoke\u2019s Theorem: there are\nonly contributions from an isolated set of N points along with a contribution from the sphere at infinity.\nWe now show that these contributions arise at the critical points of the instanton effective action (8.49).\nThe latter correspond to the vanishing\nw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7 + \u03c6\n0w\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 . (8.73)\nSo there is a branch consisting of N solutions, labelled by u, where\n\u03c7 = \u2212\u03c60u , wv\u03b1\u02d9 \u221d \u03b4uv , (8.74)\ni.e. precisely at the positions of the isolated contributions to the instanton effective action. However, it\nis apparent that these are critical points of S\u02dc only on a branch where the instanton has non-zero scale\nsize: \u03c12 = 1\n2\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 > 0. There is another branch of solutions when \u03c1 = 0, i.e. w\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 where physically\nthe instanton has shrunk to zero size. This second branch is associated with the contribution from\nthe integral over the sphere at infinity in \u03c7-space. To see this notice that when \u03c7 is eliminated via its\n\u201cequation-of-motion\u201d one has \u03c7 \u223c \u03c1\u22121: so \u03c1 \u2192 0 does indeed correspond to the circle at infinity in\n\u03c7-space. These observations are intended as anecdotal evidence in favour of some kind of localization\non the moduli space of instantons. This is subject that we will pursue in earnest in \u00a7XI.2.\n132\nIX Conformal Gauge Theories at Large N\nInstanton calculations are only reliable at weak coupling which can be achieved in a Higgs or Coulomb\nphase, giving rise to the applications reported in Chapters X.1 and VII. However, theories can be\nweakly-coupled without invoking the Higgs mechanism if they are finite, or conformal. In this case the\ngauge coupling does not run with scale and weak coupling prevails for small g. The two main examples\nthat we discuss here are the N = 4 theory and the N = 2 theory with NF = 2N hypermultiplets\nin the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We shall see that these two examples have\nsome interesting features in common and, in particular, the calculation of instanton effects in both\ncases considerably simplify in the large N limit (see Refs. [21, 106, 107]). The most striking feature\nof this limit is that the instanton measure concentrates on a subspace of the moduli space, which,\nin the N = 4 case, is essentially AdS5 \u00d7 S5. Of course this phenomenon is directly related to the\nAdS\/CFT correspondence, which we discuss in \u00a7IX.3. The approach of Refs. [21,106,107] that we will\ndescribe has been generalized to other finite gauge theories. Ref. [108] considered the N = 4 theory\nwith gauge groups Sp(N) and SO(N); Refs. [109,110] considered finite N = 2 gauge theories with gauge\ngroup Sp(N); and Ref. [111] considered finite N = 2 theories with product gauge group SU(N)k and\nhypermultiplets in bi-fundamental representations of the gauge group\u2014the \u201cquiver\u201d models.\nThe main common feature of finite gauge theories is the fact, discussed in \u00a7IV.3, that the super-\nsymmetric instanton with the full set of fermion zero modes turned on is not an exact solution of the\nequations-of-motion. Put another way, most of the fermion zero modes that appear at linear order\naround the instanton background are lifted by Yukawa interactions as evidenced by the leading order\nexpression for the instanton effective action (5.25) or (6.84) (with \u03c60a = 0 in the present context). In\nboth cases, this effective action involves a quadrilinear coupling of the Grassmann collective coordinates.\nOf course, in both cases, the supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes are protected by symme-\ntries and remain unlifted by the instanton action. The pattern of lifting dictated by the Grassmann\nquadrilinear implies that instantons of all charges k will contribute to a class of correlation functions\nwhose insertions evaluated in the instanton background are responsible for saturating the integrals over\na finite number of unlifted modes. In both cases, the number of unlifted fermion modes is sixteen.\nThis is directly the number of supersymmetric and superconformal modes in the N = 4 theory while in\nthe N = 2 theory it includes the supersymmetric and superconformal modes\u2014numbering eight\u2014along\nwith eight additional fundamental fermion zero modes.\nThe aim of this section is show how instanton contributions to these kinds of correlation functions\ncan be calculated in the large-N limit. They will turn out to have remarkable properties. The only\ndependence on the instanton charge appears in an overall numerical pre-factor:\u2329O1(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 On(x(n))\u232ainst. N\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 ( \u221e\u2211\nk=1\nknck e\n2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n)\nf(x(1), . . . , x(n)) , (9.1)\nfor some function f and coefficients ck independent of the correlator in question. At first sight, the\nlimit (9.1) looks absurd. How could it be that the only dependence on the instanton number k is\nvia an overall multiplicative factor? The reason for the simple dependence on k rests on certain very\nspecial properties of the large-N limit of the instanton calculus. Intuitively what happens in the large-\n133\nN limit is that integral over the k-instanton moduli space is dominated by configurations of k single\ninstantons occupying k commuting SU(2) subgroups of the gauge group which are therefore totally\nnon-interacting. In this sense the dominant configurations are dilute-gas-like. But, contrary to the\ndilute gas, the dominant configuration also has all the instantons lying at the same spacetime point\nXn and having the same scale size \u03c1. This accounts for the fact that the functional dependence on the\ninsertion points is the same for all instanton number. We will show that the k-dependent numerical\nfactors ck are related to interesting matrix integrals; namely, the partition functions of dimensionally\nreduced gauge theories.\nIn addition, when taking the large-N limit, it is convenient to introduce auxiliary bosonic collective\ncoordinates to bi-linearize the Grassmann quadrilinear in the instanton effective action. In the large-\nN limit these additional variables are confined to a sphere: S5 for N = 4 theory [21] and S1 for\nN = 2 [107]. The appearance of these auxiliary collective coordinate is especially interesting in the\nlight of the AdS\/CFT correspondence [112, 113] relating the N = 4 theory to Type IIB string theory\non AdS5 \u00d7 S5 as discussed in \u00a7IX.3.\nIX.1 The collective coordinate integrals at large N\nWe begin our analysis by establishing an expression for the instanton partition function in the large-N\nlimit. There are two relevant cases: N = 4 and N = 2 with NF = 2N hypermultiplets. The expressions\nfor the collective coordinate integral (5.14) is obtained from (5.55), with S\u02dc equal to (5.25), in the N = 4\ntheory and (6.84), for the N = 2 case.61 Since we are interested in pursuing a large-N limit, we can use\nthe results described in \u00a7VI.1 to resolve the ADHM constraints and therefore use the explicit version\nfor the supersymmetric volume form in (6.29). Note that the requirement N \u2265 2k will certainly be met\nin the large-N limit (for fixed k). Since we are working in a non-abelian Coulomb phase all the VEV\nvanish and the gauge symmetry remains unbroken. In this case, we can immediately integrate over the\ngauge orientation of the instanton:\n\u222b\nd4k(N\u2212k)U = 1.\nThe key to taking a large-N limit is to bi-linearize the Grassmann quadrilinear effective action (5.26)\nor (6.84), by introducing some auxiliary variables. This kind of transformation is a well-known tool for\nanalyzing the large-N limit of field theories with four-fermion interactions, like the Gross-Neveu and\nThirring models [114]. In fact we have already introduced the necessary auxiliary variables in the form\nof the k \u00d7 k matrices \u03c7a in \u00a7VI.5. In particularly the linearized instanton effective actions (6.91) and\n(6.96) involve only Grassmann bilinears.\n61The VEVs are to set to zero in both cases to preserve conformal invariance in the present applications.\n134\nIn the N = 2 theory the identity we use is\n\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22121 exp {i\u03c02\n2\nNF\u2211\nf=1\ntrkKfK\u02dcfL\u22121M\u00afAMA\n}\n= 22k\n2\n\u03c0k\n2\n\u222b\nd2k\n2\n\u03c7 exp\n{\n\u2212 4\u03c02(trk \u03c7aL\u03c7a + i2trk M\u00afAMA\u03c7\u2020 + 14 NF\u2211\nf=1\ntrkKfK\u02dcf\u03c7\n)}\n,\n(9.2)\nwhilst in the N = 4 case\u2223\u2223detk2L\u2223\u2223\u22123 exp{\u03c02\n2\n\u01ebABCDtrk\n(M\u00afAMBL\u22121M\u00afCMD)}\n= 26k\n2\n\u03c03k\n2\n\u222b\nd6k\n2\n\u03c7 exp\n{\n\u2212 4\u03c02(trk \u03c7aL\u03c7a + 12\u03a3\u00afaABtrk M\u00afAMB\u03c7a)} . (9.3)\nNotice in both cases that the appropriate factor of |detk2L| is already present in the supersymmetric\nvolume form on Mk (5.55) (or (6.29)).\nIX.1.1 The N = 4 case\nBefore we proceed, and with the large-N limit in mind, it is useful to re-scale\n\u03c7a \u2192\n\u221a\nN\n2\u03c0\n\u03c7a . (9.4)\nIt is also convenient to define\n\u03c7AB =\n1\u221a\n8\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03c7a , \u03c7a = \u2212 1\u221a2\u03a3ABa \u03c7AB (9.5)\nwhich satisfies a pseudo-reality condition following from the Hermiticity of \u03c7a:\n\u03c7\u2020AB =\n1\n2\n\u01ebABCD\u03c7CD , (9.6)\nwhere \u2020 only acts on the instanton indices rather than the SU(4) R-symmetry indices.\nAfter integrating over the gauge orientation and using the identity (9.3), the instanton partition\nfunction is\nZ\n(N=4)\nk =\n23k\n2\nN3k\n2\nC(N=4)k Ak\n\u03c03k2VolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k\n2\na\u2032 dk\n2\nW 0 d6k\n2\n\u03c7\n4\u220f\nA=1\n{\ndk(N\u22122k)\u03bdA dk(N\u22122k)\u03bd\u00afA d2k\n2\n\u03b6A d2k\n2M\u2032A\n}\n\u00d7 \u2223\u2223det2kW \u2223\u2223N\u22122k e\u2212Ntrk \u03c7aL\u03c7a+\u221a8N\u03c0trk M\u00afAMB\u03c7AB .\n(9.7)\nIn this expression, and in the following, W is the 2k \u00d7 2k matrix defined in (6.1), where the ADHM\nconstraints (6.3) are imposed; hence,\nW = 1\n2\nW 01[2]\u00d7[2] \u2212 2a\u2032ma\u2032n\u03c3\u00afmn .

One might think\nthat it is rather premature to integrate out the Grassmann variables {\u03bd\u00afA, \u03bdA} since they could be\nsaturated by insertions made into the functional integral. This is possible, but we shall find later a very\nsimple prescription for including this kind of dependence when working at large N .\nAfter integrating out the subset of Grassmann variables as above, we can collect together all the\nnon-constant terms in the collective coordinate integral which are raised to the power N as exp\u2212N\u0393.\nThe large-N \u201ceffective action\u201d is62\n\u0393 = \u2212 log det2kW \u2212 log det4k\u03c7+ trk \u03c7aL\u03c7a .

The remaining components W\nc, c = 1, 2, 3, are eliminated in favor of the a\u2032n\nvia the ADHM constraints (6.3). The action is invariant under the U(k) symmetry (2.64) which acts\nby adjoint action on all the variables.\nWith N factored out of the exponent, the measure is in a form which is amenable to a saddle-point\ntreatment as N \u2192\u221e. The critical points of \u0393 satisfy the equations\n\u01ebABCD (L \u00b7 \u03c7AB)\u03c7CE = 12\u03b4DE 1[k]\u00d7[k] , (9.11a)\n\u03c7a\u03c7a =\n1\n2\n(W\u22121)0 , (9.11b)\n[\u03c7a, [\u03c7a, a\n\u2032\nn]] = tr2(\u03c4\nc\u03c3\u00afnm)[(W\n\u22121)c, a\u2032m] . (9.11c)\nThese are obtained by varying \u0393 with respect to the matrix elements of \u03c7, W 0 and a\u2032n, respectively, and\nrewriting \u201clog det\u201d as \u201ctr log.\u201d We have defined the k \u00d7 k matrices\n(W\u22121)0 = tr2W\u22121 , (W\u22121)c = tr2 (\u03c4 cW\u22121) . (9.12)\nThe general solution to these coupled saddle-point equations is easily found. It has the simple\nproperty that all the quantities are diagonal in instanton indices:\nW 0 = diag\n(\n2\u03c121, . . . , 2\u03c1\n2\nk\n)\n, (9.13a)\n\u03c7a = diag\n(\n\u03c1\u221211 \u2126\u02c6\n1\na, . . . , \u03c1\n\u22121\nk \u2126\u02c6\nk\na\n)\n, (9.13b)\na\u2032n = diag\n(\u2212X1n, . . . ,\u2212Xkn) , (9.13c)\nup to adjoint action by the U(k) auxiliary symmetry. For quantities \u2126\u02c6ia parameterize k unit six-vectors,\nor points in S5,\n\u2126\u02c6ia\u2126\u02c6\ni\na = 1 (no sum on i) , (9.14)\n62In the following we translate back and forth as convenient between the antisymmetric tensor representation \u03c7AB and\nthe SO(6)R vector representation \u03c7a, a = 1, . . . , 6 (9.5).\n136\nwhere the radius of the ith S5 factor is \u03c1\u22121i .\nA simple picture of this leading-order saddle-point solution emerges: it can be thought of as k\nindependent copies of a large-N one-instanton saddle-point solution, where the ith large-N instanton\nis parameterized by the triple {X in, \u03c1i, \u2126\u02c6ia}. Additional insight into this solution emerges from consid-\nering the SU(2) generators (T ci )uv describing the embedding of the i\nth instanton inside SU(N). From\nEqs. (2.103), (6.2) and (9.13a) one derives the commutation relations\n[T ai , T\nb\nj ] = 2i\u03b4ij \u01ebabc T\nc\ni (9.15)\nso that at the saddle-point, thanks to the Kronecker-\u03b4, the k individual instantons lie in k mutually\ncommuting SU(2) subgroups. Actually this feature follows intuitively from large-N statistics alone,63\nand has nothing to do with either the existence of supersymmetry or with the details of the ADHM\nconstruction. Another important property is that the effective action (9.10) evaluated on these saddle-\npoint solutions is zero; hence there is no exponential dependence on N in the final result. Finally\nwe should make the technical point that, thanks to the diagonal structure of these solutions, they\nare automatically consistent with the triangle inequalities on the bosonic bi-linear W discussed in the\nparagraph following Eq. (2.84); hence we never need to specify more explicitly the integration limits on\nthe W variables.\nThe saddle-point solution depends on the moduli of each of the k large-N instantons. However, not\nall these 10k parameters are the genuine moduli, or flat directions of \u0393, because, as we shall see, they\nare \u201clifted\u201d by terms beyond quadratic order in the expansion of \u0393. In fact the only genuine moduli\nare the 10 overall large-N coordinates. The correct large-N behaviour is obtained [21] by expanding \u0393\naround the maximally degenerate saddle-point solution\nW 0 = 2\u03c12 1[k]\u00d7[k], \u03c7a = \u03c1\n\u22121\u2126\u02c6a 1[k]\u00d7[k], a\u2032n = \u2212Xn 1[k]\u00d7[k] , (9.16)\nwhich corresponds to the k large-N instantons living at a common point {Xn, \u2126\u02c6a, \u03c1}. (From the ADHM\nconstraint (6.3) it follows that the remaining components of W vanish: W c = 0 for c = 1, 2, 3.)\nThis degenerate solution, unlike Eqs. (9.13a)-(9.13c), is invariant under the residual U(k). With the\ninstantons sitting on top of one another, it looks like the complete opposite of the dilute instanton\ngas limit; however the instantons still live in k mutually commuting SU(2) subgroups of SU(N) as per\nEq. (9.15), which is a dilute-gas-like feature.\nIn order to expand about this special solution, one first needs to factor out the integrals over the\nparameters {Xn, \u03c1, \u2126\u02c6a}. This is done in the following way: for each k \u00d7 k matrix, we introduce a basis\nof traceless Hermitian matrices T\u02c6 r, r = 1, . . . , k2 \u2212 1, normalized by trk T\u02c6 rT\u02c6 s = \u03b4rs. For each k \u00d7 k\nmatrix v we separate out the \u201cscalar\u201d component v0 by taking\nv = v01[k]\u00d7[k] + v\u02c6\nrT\u02c6 r . (9.17)\nThe change of variables from the {T r} basis used in (9.7) to {1[k]\u00d7[k], T\u02c6 r} involves a Jacobian\u222b\ndk\n2\nv = k\u00b11\/2\n\u222b\ndv0 d\nk2\u22121v\u02c6, (9.18)\n63Consider the analogous problem of k randomly oriented vectors in RN in the limit N \u2192\u221e; clearly the dot products\nof these vectors tend to zero simply due to statistics.\n137\nwhere \u00b11 refers to c-number and Grassmann quantities, respectively. For the moment we continue to\nfocus on the bosonic variables, which are decomposed as follows:\na\u2032n = \u2212Xn1[k]\u00d7[k] + a\u02c6\u2032n , (9.19a)\n\u03c7a = \u03c1\n\u22121\u2126\u02c6a1[k]\u00d7[k] + \u03c7\u02c6a . (9.19b)\nBy definition the traceless matrix variables a\u02c6\u2032n and \u03c7\u02c6a are the fluctuating fields.\nInserting Eqs. (9.19a)-(9.19b) into Eq. (9.10) and Taylor expanding is a tedious though straightfor-\nward exercise. It is necessary to expand to fourth order in the fluctuating fields around the solution\nparameterized by the ten exact moduli. The expansion of the determinant terms in (9.10) is facilitated\nby first writing \u201clog det\u201d as \u201ctr log\u201d and then expanding the logarithm:\ntr2kW = 2k log \u03c1\n2 +\n1\n\u03c12\ntrk(\u03b4W\n0)\u2212 1\n4\u03c14\ntrk(\u03b4W\n0)2\n+\n1\n12\u03c16\ntrk(\u03b4W\n0)3 \u2212 1\n32\u03c18\ntrk(\u03b4W\n0)4 +\n1\n2\u03c14\ntrk\n[\na\u02c6\u2032n, a\u02c6\n\u2032\nm\n]2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(9.20)\nand\ntr4k log\u03c7 = \u22122k log(8\u03c12)\u2212 25\u03c12tr4k\n(\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n)2\n+\n29\u03c13\n3\ntr4k\n(\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n)3 \u2212 210\u03c14tr4k (\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6)4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (9.21)\nIn these expansions we have dropped fifth- and higher-order terms in the fluctuating fields. Here we are\nanticipating the fact that these terms are not needed at leading order in 1\/N . To see this we can re-scale\nthe integration variables in a standard way which shows that the fluctuations around the maximally\ndegenerate saddle point are of order N\u22121\/4. The higher order terms in the exponent therefore yield\nsubleading contributions in the 1\/N expansion. In particular, this is true for the diagonal components\nof a\u02c6\u2032n and \u03c7\u02c6a which correspond to the moduli of the generic saddle-point solution discussed earlier in\nthis Section. This shows that our large-N expansion around the maximally degenerate saddle-point\nis self-consistent. In Eq. (9.21), and in subsequent equations, we move back and forth as convenient\nbetween the 6-vector and the antisymmetric tensor representations of \u2126\u02c6 and \u03c7 using Eq. (9.5). In\nparticular, the SO(6) orthonormality condition \u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u2126\u02c6 = 1 becomes, in 4\u00d7 4 matrix language,\n\u2126\u02c6\u2126\u02c6\u2217 = \u22121\n8\n1[4]\u00d7[4] , or \u2126\u02c6\n\u22121 = \u22128\u2126\u02c6\u2217 , (9.22)\nwhich has been implemented in Eq. (9.21).\nNext we need a systematic method for re-expressing the traces over 4k \u00d7 4k matrices in Eq. (9.21)\nas traces over k \u00d7 k matrices. We will exploit the following \u201cmoves\u201d:64\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6 = \u2212\u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u2126\u02c6\u2212 1\n4\n(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)1[4]\u00d7[4] , (9.23a)\ntr4E\n\u2020F = tr4 F \u2020E = \u221212(E \u00b7 F ) , (9.23b)\ntr4E\n\u2020FG\u2020H = 1\n16\n(\nEaFaGbHb \u2212EaFbGaHb + EaFbGbHa\n)\n. (9.23c)\n64In the following, we should emphasize that \u2020 only acts on instanton indices, as per the reality condition (9.6), and\nnot on SU(4) matrix indices.\n138\nOn the left-hand sides of Eq. (9.23b)-(9.23c), the 4k \u00d7 4k matrices {E,F,G,H} are assumed to be\nantisymmetric in SU(4)R indices and subject to the usual conditions (9.6)-(9.5); the identity (9.23a)\nfollows from a double application of Eq. (9.6). Using Eqs. (9.22)-(9.23c) in an iterative fashion, it is\nthen easy to derive the following trace identities:\ntr4k\n(\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n)2\n= \u2212tr4k \u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u2126\u02c6\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\u2212 14trk\n(\n\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6 tr4(\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6)\n)\n=\n1\n23\ntrk\n(\n\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)2 \u2212 1\n24\ntrk \u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6 , (9.24a)\ntr4k\n(\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n)3\n= 1\n8\ntr4k(\u03c7\u02c6\n\u2020\u03c7\u02c6\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6) + 1\n64\ntrk (\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)2\u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6\u2212 132trk (\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)3\n= \u2212 1\n25\ntrk\n(\n\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)3 + 3\n27\ntrk \u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6 \u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6 , (9.24b)\ntr4k\n(\n\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n)4\n= tr4k\n(\n1\n64\n\u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u03c7\u02c6\u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u03c7\u02c6\u2212 1\n32\n\u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u03c7\u02c6(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\n\u2212 1\n32\n(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6\u03c7\u02c6\u2020\u03c7\u02c6 + 1\n16\n(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)\u2126\u02c6\u2217\u03c7\u02c6)\n=\n1\n27\ntrk\n(\n\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)4 \u2212 1\n27\ntrk\n(\n\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)2\u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6+ 1\n29\ntrk\n(\n\u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)2 \u2212 1\n210\ntrk \u03c7\u02c6a\u03c7\u02c6b\u03c7\u02c6a\u03c7\u02c6b . (9.24c)\nAs before, on the left-hand side of these formulae, 4k \u00d7 4k matrix multiplication is implied, whereas\non the right-hand side, all SO(6) indices are saturated in standard 6-vector inner products, leaving the\ntraces over k \u00d7 k matrices.\nFrom Eqs.

(9.26c)\nNotice that only k2 fluctuations, denoted \u03d5, are actually lifted at quadratic order. This, in turn, implies\nthat certain terms in \u0393(3) and \u0393(4) are subleading, and can be omitted. Specifically, the omitted terms\nin the final rewrites in Eqs. (9.26b)-(9.26c) contain, respectively, two or more, and one or more, factors\nof the quadratically lifted \u03d5 modes, and consequently are suppressed in 1\/N (as a simple re-scaling\nargument again confirms).\nNow let us perform the elementary Gaussian integration over the \u03d5\u2019s. Changing integration variables\n139\nin Eq. (9.7) from dk\n2\nW 0 to dk\n2\n\u03d5 using Eq. (9.26a), one finds:\u222b\ndk\n2\nW 0 e\u2212N(\u0393\n(2)+\u0393(3)) =\n(4\u03c0\u03c14\nN\n)k2\/2\ne\u2212N\u0393\n(4)\u2032\n(9.27)\nwhere the new induced quartic coupling reads\n\u0393(4)\u2032 = \u2212\u03c14trk\n(\n\u03c7\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6\u2212 4(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6)2)2 . (9.28)\nCombining \u0393(4)\u2032 with the original quartic coupling (9.26c) gives for the effective bosonic small-fluctuations\naction:\n\u0393b = \u22121\n2\ntrk\n(\n\u03c1\u22124[a\u02c6\u2032n, a\u02c6\n\u2032\nm]\n2 + 2[\u03c7\u02c6a, a\u02c6\n\u2032\nn]\n2 + \u03c14[\u03c7\u02c6a, \u03c7\u02c6b]\n2\n)\n. (9.29)\nRemarkably, all dependence on the unit vector \u2126\u02c6a has canceled out.\nNotice that apart from the absence of derivative terms, the expression (9.29) looks like a Yang-Mills\nfield strength for the gauge group SU(k)! We can make this explicit by introducing a ten-dimensional\nvector field AM ,\nAM = N\n1\/4\n(\n\u03c1\u22121a\u02c6\u2032n, \u03c1\u03c7\u02c6a\n)\n, M = 1, . . . , 10 , (9.30)\nin terms of which\nN\u0393b(AM) = \u22121\n2\ntrk [AM , AN ]\n2 . (9.31)\nWe recognize this as precisely the action of ten-dimensional SU(k) gauge theory, reduced to 0 dimensions,\ni.e. with all derivatives set to zero.\nNow let us turn to the Grassmann collective coordinates. Since N = 4 supersymmetry in four\ndimensions descends from N = 1 supersymmetry in ten dimensions, and since all our saddle-point\nmanipulations commute with supersymmetry, we expect to find the N = 1 supersymmetric completion\nof the ten-dimensional dimensionally-reduced action (9.31), namely\nN\u0393f(AM ,\u03a8) = \u2212itrk \u03a8\u00af\u0393M [AM ,\u03a8] , (9.32)\nwhere \u03a8 is a ten-dimensional Majorana-Weyl spinor, and \u0393M is an element of the ten-dimensional\nClifford algebra. To see how this comes about, we first separate out from the fermionic collective\ncoordinates the exact zero modes, in analogy to Eqs. (9.19a)-(9.19b):\nM\u2032A\u03b1 = \u22124i\u03beA\u03b1 1[k]\u00d7[k] \u2212 4ia\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A + M\u02c6\u2032A\u03b1 , (9.33a)\n\u03b6 \u03b1\u02d9A = \u22124i\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A1[k]\u00d7[k] + \u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9A . (9.33b)\nHere, \u03beA\u03b1 and \u03b7\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9A are the supersymmetric and superconformal fermion modes (4.43)-(4.46). Expanding\nthe remaining part of the fermion coupling in the exponent of (9.3) around the special solution (9.16)\nand using the relations (6.3) and (9.26a), we find\nN\u0393f =\n(\n8\u03c02N\n)1\/2\ntrk\n[(\n\u03d5\u2212 2\u03c1(\u2126\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03c7\u02c6))\u03c1\u2126\u02c6AB \u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9A\u03b6\u02c6B\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03c1\u22121\u2126\u02c6AB[a\u02c6\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9,M\u02c6\u2032\u03b1A]\u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9B\n+ \u03c7\u02c6AB\n(\n\u03c12\u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9A\u03b6\u02c6B\u03b1\u02d9 + M\u02c6\u2032\u03b1AM\u02c6\u2032B\u03b1\n)]\n.\n(9.34)\n140\nIf we now define the ten-dimensional Majorana-Weyl fermion field \u03a8\n\u03a8 =\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n2\nN1\/8\n[\n\u03c1\u22121\/2\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u2297\n(\n1\n0\n)\nM\u02c6\u2032A\u03b1 + \u03c11\/2\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u2297\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9A\n]\n, (9.35)\nand the \u0393M matrices according to Eq. (9.36) below, we do in fact recover the simple form (9.32).\nIn moving from Eq. (9.34) to Eq. (9.32) we have dropped the term depending on \u03d5; since \u03d5 is a\nquadratically lifted bosonic mode its contribution is suppressed in large N compared to the other\ncouplings in Eq. (9.34), as a simple re-scaling argument confirms. The representation of the SO(10)\n\u0393-matrices is constructed via the decomposition SO(10) \u2283 SO(6)\u00d7 SO(4) in the following way. Firstly,\nWe define an SO(6) rotation matrix R, RRT = 1, such that \u2126\u02c6\u2032a = Rab\u2126\u02c6b lies entirely along, say, the\nfirst direction, i.e. \u2126\u02c6\u2032a \u221d \u03b4a1. In the new basis, we have a representation of the SO(6) Clifford algebra\n\u0393\u2032a = Rab\u0393b. In the rotated basis, we can construct a representation of the SO(10) Clifford algebra as\nfollows:\n\u0393\u2032M =\n{\n\u0393\u20321 \u2297 \u03b3n , \u0393\u2032a \u2297\n(\n\u03b4a1\u03b35 + (1\u2212 \u03b4a1)1[4]\u00d7[4]\n)}\n, (9.36)\nwhere n = 1, . . . , 4 and a = 1, . . . , 6. The representation of the SO(10) Clifford algebra that we need is\nthen found by un-doing the rotation on the six-dimensional subspace:\n\u0393M =\n{\n\u0393\u20321 \u2297 \u03b3n , (R\u22121)ab\u0393\u2032b \u2297\n(\n\u03b4b1\u03b35 + (1\u2212 \u03b4b1)1[4]\u00d7[4]\n)}\n. (9.37)\nOne can then verify that (9.35) is Majorana-Weyl with respect to this basis. Note that unlike the\nbosonic sector, the \u2126\u02c6a dependence of the fermionic action does not actually disappear; it is simply\nsubsumed into the representation of the SO(10) \u0393-matrices.\nFinally our effective large-N k-instanton partition function has the form\nZ\n(N=4)\nk\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192\n\u221a\nN\nk3217k2\/2\u2212k\/2+25\u03c09k2\/2+9VolU(k)\n\u222b\n\u03c1\u22125d\u03c1 d4X d5\u2126\u02c6\n4\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beAd2\u03b7\u00afA \u00b7 Z\u0302(d=10)SU(k) , (9.38)\nwhere Z\u0302(d=10)SU(k) is the partition function of anN = 1 supersymmetric SU(k) gauge theory in ten dimensions\ndimensionally reduced to zero dimensions:\nZ\u0302\n(d=10)\nSU(k) =\n\u222b\nSU(k)\nd10Ad16\u03a8 e\u2212S(A\u00b5,\u03a8) ,\nS(AM ,\u03a8) = N(\u0393b + \u0393f) = \u22121\n2\ntrk [AM , AN ]\n2 \u2212 itrk \u03a8\u00af\u0393M [AM ,\u03a8] .\n(9.39)\nNotice that the rest of the measure, up to numerical factors, is independent of the instanton number k.\nWhen integrating expressions which are independent of the SU(k) degrees-of-freedom, Z\u0302(d=10)SU(k) is simply\nan overall constant factor. A calculation of Ref. [115] revealed that Z\u0302(d=10)SU(k) is proportional to\n\u2211\nd|k d\n\u22122,\na sum over the positive integer divisors d of k. However, the constant of proportionality was fixed\ndefinitively in Ref. [116] to give65\nZ\u0302\n(d=10)\nSU(k) =\n217k\n2\/2+k\/2\u22129\u03c05k\n2+k\/2\u22127\/2k\u22121\/2\u220fk\u22121\ni=1 i!\n\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n. (9.40)\n65In comparing to Ref. [116], it is important to note that our convention for the normalization of the generators is\ntrkT\u02c6\nrT\u02c6 s = \u03b4rs, rather than 12\u03b4\nrs in Ref. [116].\n141\nIn summary, the effective large-N , semi-classically leading-order, collective coordinate measure has\nthe following simple form [21]:\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4Z(N=4)k\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192\n\u221a\nN\n233\u03c027\/2\nk\u22127\/2e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n{\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n}\u222b d4X d\u03c1\n\u03c15\nd5\u2126\u02c6\n4\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beAd2\u03b7\u00afA . (9.41)\nIX.1.2 The N = 2 case\nWe now follow essentially the same steps to deduce a form for the large-N collective coordinates integral\nin the finite N = 2 theory following Ref. [107]. In view of the large-N limit to come, we first re-scale\n\u03c7\u2192\n\u221a\nN\n2\u03c0\n\u03c7 . (9.42)\nPerforming the integration over the \u03bdA\u2019s and \u03bd\u00afA\u2019s gives\u222b \u220f\nA=1,2\ndk(N\u22122k)\u03bdA dk(N\u22122k)\u03bd\u00afA exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u221a\nN\u03c0trk \u03c7\n\u2020\u03bd\u00afA\u03bdA\n]\n=\n(\nN\u03c02\n)k(N\u22122k) \u2223\u2223detk\u03c7\u2020\u2223\u22232(N\u22122k) . (9.43)\nSimilarly, integrating out the matter Grassmann collective coordinates\u222b\nd2kNK d2kNK\u02dc exp\n[\u221aN\n4\n\u03c0\nNF=2N\u2211\nf=1\ntrkKfK\u02dcf\u03c7\n]\n=\n(N\u03c02\n4\n)kN \u2223\u2223detk\u03c7\u2223\u22232N . (9.44)\nOnce again, we collect all the terms to the power N to give the large-N \u201ceffective action\u201d\n\u0393 = \u2212 log det2kW \u2212 2 log detk\u03c7\u03c7\u2020 + trk \u03c7aL\u03c7a . (9.45)\nWe now turn to the solution of the large-N saddle-point equations. These are the coupled Euler-\nLagrange equations that come from extremizing \u0393 with respect to {a\u2032n,W 0, \u03c7a}. The analysis of these\ncoupled equations is virtually identical to the N = 4 case in \u00a7IX.1.1; hence we suppress the calculational\ndetails. In particular, the dominant configuration is the maximally degenerate solution (9.16)\nwhere now \u2126\u02c6a is a unit 2-vector. It is convenient to parameterize \u2126\u02c6a by the phase angle \u03c6:\n\u2126\u02c61 + i\u2126\u02c62 = e\ni\u03c6 . (9.46)\nThe next stage of the analysis is to expand the effective action in the fluctuations out to sufficient\norder to ensure the convergence of the integrals over the fluctuations. Fortunately, the analysis need\nnot be repeated because our effective action (9.45) is, up to a constant, simply the N = 4 effective\naction (9.10) with the replacements \u03c712 \u2192 \u03c7\/\n\u221a\n8, \u03c734 \u2192 \u03c7\u2020\/\n\u221a\n8 and all other components of \u03c7AB set to\nzero. The fluctuations in W 0 are integrated out at Gaussian order to leave integrals over the remaining\nfluctuations in a\u02c6\u2032n and \u03c7\u02c6a, the traceless parts, that are lifted at quartic order; the terms beyond quartic\n142\norder are then formally suppressed by (fractional) powers of 1\/N , and may be dropped. The \u201caction\u201d\nfor these quartic fluctuations is precisely the action for six-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, as in (9.30)\nand (9.31) but where the indices M = 1, . . . , 6.\nNot surprisingly the coupling to the Grassmann collective coordinates completes the six-dimensional\ntheory to a supersymmetric gauge theory in six dimensions dimensionally reduced to 0 dimensions. The\nsix-dimensional theory has eight independent supersymmetries and is therefore an N = (1, 0) theory in\nsix dimensions. The eight component fermion field of the N = (1, 0) theory has components\n\u03a8 =\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n2\nN1\/8e\u2212i\u03c6\/2\n(\n\u03c1\u22121\/2M\u02c6\u2032A\u03b1 , \u03c11\/2\u03b6\u02c6 \u03b1\u02d9A\n)\n, (9.47)\nFollowing the same steps as in the N = 4 theory, the effective large-N k-instanton measure, for the\nleading order semi-classical approximation of the functional integral, has the form\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4Z\n(N=2,NF=2N)\nk\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192\nN1\/2e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\nk29k2\/2\u2212k\/2+12 \u03c05k2\/2+4VolU(k)\n\u222b\n\u03c1\u22125d\u03c1 d4X d\u03c6 e4i\u03c6\n2\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beAd2\u03b7\u00afA \u00b7 Z\u0302(d=6)SU(k) ,\n(9.48)\nwhere Z\u02c6k is the partition function of the N = (1, 0) supersymmetric SU(k) gauge theory in six dimen-\nsions dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions:\nZ\u0302\n(d=6)\nSU(k) =\n\u222b\nSU(k)\nd6Ad8\u03a8 e\u2212S(A\u00b5,\u03a8) ,\nS(AM ,\u03a8) = N(\u0393b + \u0393f) = \u22121\n2\ntrk [AM , AN ]\n2 \u2212 itrk \u03a8\u00af\u0393M [AM ,\u03a8] .\n(9.49)\nWhen integrating expressions which are independent of the SU(k) degrees-of-freedom, Z\u0302(d=6)SU(k) is simply\nan overall constant factor that was evaluated in [116]. In our notation66\nZ\u02c6\n(d=6)\nSU(k) =\n(\u221a\n2\u03c0\n)6(k2\u22121)(\u221a\n2\n)(8\u22126)(k2\u22121) \u00b7 2k(k+1)\/2\u03c0(k\u22121)\/2\n2\n\u221a\nk\n\u220fk\u22121\ni=1 i!\n\u00b7 1\nk2\n. (9.50)\nIn summary, the effective large-N collective coordinate measure has the following simple form [107]:\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4Z\n(N=2,NF=2N)\nk\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192\n\u221a\nN\n217\u03c015\/2\nk\u22127\/2e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u222b\nd4X d\u03c1\n\u03c15\nd\u03c6 e4i\u03c6\n2\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beAd2\u03b7\u00afA . (9.51)\nThis has a remarkable similarity to the form of the N = 4 measure (9.41). Apart from the differences\nin the overall numerical factors, the integral over S5 is replaced by S1 and the N = 4 measure involves,\nin addition, the factor\n\u2211\nd|k d\n\u22122, the sum over the integer divisors of k. Notice that the\n\u221a\nN dependence\nand factor of k\u22127\/2 is the same in both cases.\n66We have written the result in a way which allows an easy comparison with [116]. The factors of\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 and\n\u221a\n2 arise,\nrespectively, from the difference in the definition of the bosonic integrals and the normalization of the generators: we\nhave trk T\nrT s = \u03b4rs rather than 12\u03b4\nrs. The remaining factors are the result of [116].\n143\nThe appearance of the e4i\u03c6 phase in (9.51) implies a selection rule in order that correlation functions\nare non-vanishing. This is a relic of fermion zero mode counting. From (9.2), we see each insertion of an\nadjoint fermion Grassmann collective coordinate (other than those associated to broken supersymmetry\nand superconformal invariance which drop out from the couplings in (9.2)) implies an insertion of ei\u03c6\/2\nand each insertion of a fundamental fermion Grassmann collective coordinate implies an insertion of\ne\u2212i\u03c6\/2. The selection rule implies that the difference between the latter and former is 8. Therefore\nthe simplest kind of non-vanishing correlation functions would involve insertions that saturate the 8\nintegrals over \u03beA and \u03b7\u00afA and, in addition, integrals over 8 of the fundamental fermion Grassmann\ncollective coordinates {K, K\u02dc}.\nIX.2 Large-N correlation functions\nHaving established the form for the collective coordinate integral in the large-N limit, we can now\ncalculate correlation functions of various composite operators. We are primarily interested in those\ncorrelators that receive contributions from all instanton numbers. From the form of the integrals (9.38)\nand (9.48), we can now identify those these as the ones for which the leading order (in 1\/N) expression\nfor the insertion is independent of the SU(k) variables. Hence the only non-trivial dependence is on\n{Xn, \u03c1, \u2126\u02c6a} and {\u03beA, \u03b7\u00afA}.67 In this case, we can use the reduced form of the integrals (9.41) and (9.51).\nFor these special correlation functions the only dependence on the instanton charge will be through an\noverall multiplicative factor as advertised in (9.1).\nBefore considering specific insertions, we can make some useful general statements. At leading order\nin 1\/N , we can replace each operator insertion with its classical k-instanton saddle-point value. Since\nthe saddle-point solution (9.16) is relatively simple, this observation greatly streamlines the form of the\noperator insertions. We will restrict our attention to operators consisting of a single trace on the gauge\ngroup index of a product of adjoint scalars, fermions and field strengths. Each of these three adjoint\nquantities is of the type U\u00afXU where U is the ADHM quantity defined in (2.47) and X is some matrix\nof ADHM variables; consequently the insertions have the form\nO(x) = trN\n[\nU\u00afX1UU\u00afX2U \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 U\u00afXpU\n]\n= trN+2k\n[PX1PX2P \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7PXp] , (9.52)\nwhere P = UU\u00af is the projection operator (2.51). It is easily checked that at the saddle-point, the\nbosonic ADHM quantities f , a\u2032n, L and P collapse to\nf \u2192 1\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12 1[k]\u00d7[k] , a\n\u2032\nn \u2192 \u2212Xn1[k]\u00d7[k] , L \u2192 2\u03c12 ,\nP = 1\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12\n(\n((x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)1[N]\u00d7[N] \u2212 w\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212w\u03b1\u02d9(x\u00af\u2212 X\u00af)\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\n\u2212(x\u2212X)\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u03c121[2k]\u00d7[2k]\n)\n.\n(9.53)\nOne can verify that deviations from these saddle-point values are suppressed by powers of N\u22121\/4.\nThe analogous replacement prescription for the fermionic ADHM quantities is, in general, somewhat\ntrickier. Recall the expansions (9.33a) for the Grassmann collective coordinates. In analogy with the\n67We will describe how dependence on \u2126\u02c6a in the insertion arises in due course.\n144\nbosonic quantities (9.16)-(9.53), it is useful to think of the unlifted variables \u03beA and \u03b7\u00afA themselves as\nthe arising from a saddle-point evaluation:\nM\u2032A\u03b1 \u2192 \u22124i\u03beA\u03b1 1[k]\u00d7[k] , \u03b6 \u03b1\u02d9A \u2192 \u22124i\u03b7\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A1[k]\u00d7[k] . (9.54)\nIndeed, the scaling (9.35) implies that the remaining variables denoted M\u02c6\u2032A and \u03b6\u02c6A in (9.33a) are\nsubleading compared to \u03beA and \u03b7\u00afA by a factor of N\u22121\/8. There remain the modes \u03bdA and \u03bd\u00afA, which are\ndistinct from the others in that they carry an SU(N) index u. From their coupling to \u03c7a in Eq. (9.9),\none sees that each \u03bd\u00afA\u03bdB pair in an insertion, for a fixed, un-summed value of the index u, costs a factor\nof N1\/2; however, summing on u (as required by gauge invariance) then turns this N\u22121\/2 suppression\ninto an N1\/2 enhancement. In other words, \u03bdA and \u03bd\u00afA factors in the insertions should each be thought\nof as being enhanced by N1\/4. The large-N rule of thumb for choosing Grassmann collective coordinates\nin correlators is now clear: the insertions should saturate as many of the {\u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA} integrals as possible,\nwith the proviso that the integrals over the {\u03beA, \u03b7\u00afA} must be saturated.\nNotice in order to consider insertions of {\u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA} and {K, K\u02dc} we must return to return to the\ncollective coordinates before these variables have been integrated out. We take the N = 4 case first\nand show, to leading order in 1\/N , the gauge invariant combination \u03bd\u00afA\u03bdB in the effective integration\nmeasure (9.41) is replaced by\n\u03bd\u00afA\u03bdB \u2192 \u2212\u03c1N\n1\/2\n\u03c0\n\u03a3ABa \u2126\u02c6a1[k]\u00d7[k] , (9.55)\nwhere the N1\/2 dependence has already been noted. To this end, consider a general insertion with a\nstring of such combinations \u03bd\u00afA1\u03bdB1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03bd\u00afAp\u03bdBp . We must insert this expression into the measure\nbefore the \u03bd integrals have been performed. Then performing the \u03bd integrals as in (9.9) in the presence of\nthe insertion leads to a modified expression involving factors of \u03c7\u22121 which can be derived by considering\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7tA1B1\n\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u2202\n\u2202\u03c7tApBp\n\u2223\u2223det4k\u03c7\u2223\u2223N\u22122k\n= Np\n\u2223\u2223det4k\u03c7\u2223\u2223N\u22122k(\u03c7\u22121)B1A1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 (\u03c7\u22121)BpAp + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (9.56)\nwhere t (transpose) acts on instanton indices and the ellipsis represent terms of lower order in 1\/N . This\nshows that, after performing the \u03bd integrals, a term of the form \u03bd\u00afA\u03bdB is replaced by\u2212(\u221aN\/\u221a8\u03c0)(\u03c7\u22121)BA,\nto leading order. Now we replace \u03c7 with its saddle-point value (9.16) and use (9.5) to give (9.55). The\nreplacement elucidates the mysterious appearance of the variables \u2126\u02c6a.\nIn the N = 2 theory, examination of Eq. (9.2) yields a similar replacement\n\u03bd\u00afA\u03bdB \u2212\u2192 g\u03c1\n\u221a\n2iN\n\u03c0\n\u01ebABei\u03c61[k]\u00d7[k] . (9.57)\nThis leaves the matter Grassmann collective coordinates {K, K\u02dc}. Again after examining (9.2), for each\nflavour f = 1, . . . , 2N , we have the replacement\nKf K\u02dcf \u2212\u2192 \u03c1\n\u221a\n2i\n\u03c0\n\u221a\nN\ne\u2212i\u03c61[k]\u00d7[k] . (9.58)\n145\nWe now consider some examples. First of all, in the N = 4 theory there are a class of correlation\nfunctions of type described above motivated by the AdS\/CFT correspondence (discussed in \u00a7IX.3). The\nsimplest involves the 16-point correlation function of the fermionic composite operator\n\u039bA = g2 \u03c3mntrN Fmn \u03bb\nA . (9.59)\nSince, to leading order in g, each insertion is linear in Grassmann collective coordinates, we only need the\ndependence on the collective coordinates {\u03beA, \u03b7\u00afA}, since the other Grassmann coordinates must be lifted\nby the instanton effective action. In this case to find the dependence, we can use the supersymmetric\nsweeping out procedure defined in \u00a7IV.3 with the x-dependent variation parameter (4.44) giving68\n\u039bA = ig5\/2\u03c3mn\u03c3kl\u03be\nA(x) trN FmnFkl + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . = \u2212 i4g5\/2\u03beA(x) trN F 2mn + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (9.60)\nThe ellipsis represent the dependence on the other Grassmann collective coordinates that are not needed.\nNext we can use the identity (C.6) and finally insert the saddle-point expression for f in Eq. (9.53):\n\u039bA = 24ikg1\/2\u03beA(x)\n\u03c14(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (9.61)\nThen using Eqs. (9.41) and (9.61), the large-N k-instanton contribution to the 16-point correlator is\nprecisely [21]\n\u2329\n\u039bA1\u03b11 (x\n(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u039bA16\u03b116 (x(16))\n\u232a\ninst\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 3\n16215g8\n\u221a\nN\n\u03c027\/2\n{ \u221e\u2211\nk=1\nk25\/2e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n}\n\u00d7\n\u222b\nd4Xd\u03c1\n\u03c15\n4\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beA d2\u03b7\u00afA\n16\u220f\nl=1\n\u03beAl\u03b1l (x\n(l))\u03c14(\n(x(l) \u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4 .\n(9.62)\nFor application to the AdS\/CFT correspondence it is unnecessary to perform the remaining integrals.\nThe correlator (9.62) has the distinguishing property that the functional dependence on the insertion\npoints given by the integral term can be reproduced by a single instanton calculation with gauge\ngroup SU(2). The reason is clear: only the dependence of the insertions on the supersymmetric and\nsuperconformal Grassmann coordinates was required. In particular the saddle-point evaluation of the\nrelevant part of the insertion (9.61) is identical to the single instanton in SU(2). So at large N the\ndependence on k and N only appears in an overall multiplicative factor. In fact there is a whole family\nof related correlators considered in Ref. [117] for which the same property holds and a calculation for a\nsingle instanton in SU(2) is sufficient to obtain the functional dependence on the insertion points. We\nhave now explained the puzzle of why the analysis of Ref. [117] involving a single instanton in SU(2)\nwas able to capture effects that ultimately, via the AdS\/CFT correspondence should have been valid\nat large-N only.\nThere are more general correlation functions involving insertions with non-trivial SO(6)R-transformation\nproperties for which a calculation in SU(2) would not suffice. For example consider the insertion of the\ncomposite field\nOa1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap(x) = trN\n[\n\u03c6a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6apF 2mn\n]\n, (9.63)\n68The extra factor of g1\/2 follows form the re-scaling (4.42).\n146\nwhose form is motivated by the AdS\/CFT correspondence. We now consider this evaluated at the saddle\npoint. In general, O depends on the Grassmann variables {\u00b5A, \u00b5\u00afA}, as well as the supersymmetric and\nsuperconformal variables. The resulting expressions are rather cumbersome so we will assume that the\nintegrals over the supersymmetric and superconformal variables are saturated by other insertions, for\nexample, by sixteen insertions of \u039bA. In this case we only need the dependence of O on the {\u03bdA, \u03bd\u00afA}:\nOa1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap(x) \u223c\n\u03c14(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)p+4 \u03a3\u00afa1A1B1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03a3\u00afapApBptrk[\u03bd\u00afA1\u03bdB1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03bd\u00afAp\u03bdBp] . (9.64)\nAt leading order in 1\/N we need use the replacement (9.55) to obtain\nOa1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap(x) \u223c kNp\/2\n\u03c14+p(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)p+4 \u2126\u02c6a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2126\u02c6ap . (9.65)\nIn this case, we see that the insertion depends explicitly on the S5 coordinate \u2126\u02c6a.\nIn the N = 2 theory, a simple correlator involves 8 insertions of \u039bA, as in (9.59) where now A = 1, 2,\nand 4 insertions of the gauge-invariant operator\nQf (x) = g\n2trN \u03c7f \u03c7\u02dcf , (9.66)\nwhich is quadratic in the matter Grassmann collective coordinates. Evaluating this on the saddle-point\nsolution using the expression (6.53) along with the leading-order replacement (9.58), we have\nQf(x) =\ngk\n\u221a\n8i\n\u03c0\n\u221a\nN\n\u03c12(\n(x\u2212X)2 + \u03c12)3 e\u2212i\u03c6 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (9.67)\nNotice that the 4 insertions of Qf involve a factor of e\n\u22124i\u03c6 which cancels the factor of e4i\u03c6 in Eq. (9.51),\nso the integral over \u03c6 yields the constant 2\u03c0. Hence,\n\u2329\n\u039bA1\u03b11 (x\n(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u039bA8\u03b18 (x(8))Qf1(x(9))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7Qf4(x(12))\n\u232a\ninst\nN\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2192 3\n8214g8\n\u03c021\/2N3\/2\n{ \u221e\u2211\nk=1\nk17\/2e2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n}\n\u00d7\n\u222b\nd4Xd\u03c1\n\u03c15\n2\u220f\nA=1\nd2\u03beA d2\u03b7\u00afA\n8\u220f\nl=1\n\u03beAl\u03b1l (x\n(l))\u03c14(\n(x(l) \u2212X)2 + \u03c12)4\n4\u220f\nl=1\n\u03c12(\n(x(l+8) \u2212X)2 + \u03c12)3 .\n(9.68)\nIX.3 Instantons and the AdS\/CFT correspondence\nThe formalism that we have used to calculate the instanton contributions to certain correlation functions\nat leading order in 1\/N is particularly interesting in light of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. The\nbasic example of the AdS\/CFT correspondence, due to Maldacena [112] (see also the comprehensive\nreview [113]), states that the N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is equivalent to Type IIB string\ntheory on an AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background. In particular, the gauge coupling g and vacuum angle \u03b8 of the\nfour-dimensional theory are given in terms of the string parameters by\ng =\n\u221a\n4\u03c0gst =\n\u221a\n4\u03c0e\u03c6 , \u03b8 = 2\u03c0C(0) . (9.69)\n147\nHere, gst is the string coupling while \u03c6 and C\n(0) are the expectation values of the dilaton and Ramond-\nRamond scalar, respectively, of Type IIB string theory. Also N appears explicitly, through the relation\nL2\n\u03b1\u2032\n=\n\u221a\ng2N (9.70)\nwhere (\u03b1\u2032)\u22121 is the string tension and L is the radius of both the AdS5 and S5 factors of the background.\nIX.3.1 The instanton collective coordinate integral\nEven before we consider application of the AdS\/CFT correspondence to correlation functions, and how\nit applies to instantons, we can already see in the form of the effective large-N collective coordinate\nintegral (9.41) a remarkable relation to AdS5 \u00d7 S5. The c-number integrals are precisely the volume\nform on this space, where the AdS5 part has the metric\nds2 = \u03c1\u22122(dX2n + d\u03c1\n2) (9.71)\nso that \u03c1 is the radial variable. This fact alone strongly suggests that Yang-Mills instantons are identified\nin the large-N limit with D-instantons in the Type IIB string theory. Some relevant aspects of D-branes\nin Type II string theory are summarized in \u00a7X.3. In particular, the contribution of k D-instantons to\nlow energy correlators is governed by the U(k) matrix integral (10.52). For the most part, the SU(k)\npart of the integral can be factored off as an overall numerical constant; hence,\nZk \u223c\ne\u22122\u03c0k(e\n\u2212\u03c6+iC(0))\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd10X d16\u0398 \u00b7 Z\u02c6k , (9.72)\nwhere Z\u02c6k is the same SU(k) matrix integral that we defined in (9.49) and XM and \u0398 are the abelian\ncomponents of the fields. This D-instanton collective coordinate integral is appropriate to the case of\nflat ten-dimensional space. However, the results of Banks and Green [118] imply that since AdS5\u00d7S5 is\nconformally flat a similar expression should apply to this background with the bosonic abelian integrals\nreplaced by the appropriate volume form of AdS5 \u00d7 S5. Being careful with the pre-factor, one has the\nD-instanton collective coordinate integral [21, 117]\nZk\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nAdS5\u00d7S5\n\u223c (\u03b1\u2032)\u22121(ke\u03c6)\u22127\/2 e\u22122\u03c0k(e\n\u2212\u03c6+iC(0))\n\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n\u222b\nd\u03c1 d4X\n\u03c15\nd5\u2126\u02c6 d16\u0398 . (9.73)\nUsing the relation between the couplings of the string theory and the gauge theory in (9.69) this is\nprecisely the leading order collective coordinate integral in the large-N limit of the N = 4 instanton\ncalculus (9.41).69 This equivalence of the large-N Yang-Mills instanton measure and the D-instanton\nmeasure on AdS5\u00d7S5 is rather stunning evidence for the AdS\/CFT correspondence. It is very satisfying\nthat instantons at largeN seem to probe the AdS5\u00d7S5 geometry directly. Although, as discussed below,\nthis relation implies the existence of an as yet un-proved non-renormalization theorem for a certain class\n69There appears to be a mismatch of g8, however, this is due to our normalization of the Grassmann collective co-\nordinates. Re-scaling the supersymmetric and superconformal collective coordinates, \u03beA and \u03b7\u00afA, by g1\/2 produces the\nmissing factor of g8.\n148\nof correlation functions (like those discussed in \u00a7IX.2) protecting them against perturbative corrections\nin g2N . In what follows, we shall make this correspondence between large-N instanton and D-instanton\neffects even more convincing by considering these correlation functions.\nIn \u00a7X.3 we will establish a relation between Yang-Mills instantons and D-instantons which is ap-\nparently rather different from that we have just described. We will show in \u00a7X.3 how k D-instantons\nin the presence of N D3-branes are precisely identified with k Yang-Mills instantons in U(N) gauge\ntheory describing the collective dynamics of the D3-branes. This is true in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 for fixed\ngst (in other words fixed coupling g on the D3-branes) in which bulk supergravity modes decouple\nfrom the world-volume theory of the D3-branes. The question is how this description in terms of D-\ninstantons moving in the background of D3-branes relates to the description of D-instantons moving in\nthe AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background (but with no D3-branes) established above? The answer is interesting be-\ncause it illuminates some basic features of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. In the limit of large N (with\ng2N large and small g) the background of D3-branes is replaced by its near-horizon geometry, namely\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5. In a certain sense the D3-branes disappear to be replaced by non-trivial geometry. We can\nsee this happening explicitly with the D-instanton\/D3-brane system. The presence of the D3-branes in\nthe D-instanton matrix theory is signaled by the fundamental hypermultiplet variables {w\u03b1\u02d9, \u00b5A}, and\ntheir conjugates, describing open strings stretched between the D-instantons and D3-branes. At large\nN , these degrees-of-freedom can be integrated out in the way described in \u00a7IX.1 to yield an effective\ncollective coordinate integral (9.38) which exhibits the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 geometry explicitly. So the analogue\nof taking the near horizon geometry is the process of integrating out the degrees-of-freedom of open\nstrings stretched between the D-instantons and D3-branes and taking the large-N limit. The remaining\npuzzle is that this should be done at weak coupling, i.e. small g2N , whereas the dual supergravity re-\ngion of the AdS\/CFT correspondence is valid at large g2N . Yet again, this strongly suggests that some\nnon-renormalization theorem in g2N is a work: something we shall comment on in the next section.\nIX.3.2 Correlation functions\nA more precise statement of the AdS\/CFT correspondence was presented in Refs. [119,120]. The N = 4\ngauge theory is to be thought of living on the four-dimensional boundary of AdS5. In particular, each\nchiral primary operator O in the boundary conformal field theory is identified with a particular Kaluza-\nKlein mode of the supergravity fields which we denote as \u03a6O. In general it is not known how to solve\nstring theory on an AdS background. However, the AdS\/CFT correspondence is still useful because\nin a certain limit we can approximate the full string theory by its supergravity low-energy limit. This\nrequires weak coupling (small g) but, in addition, the length scale L must be large compared with the\nstring length scale\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032. This latter requirement is met when the \u2019t Hooft coupling g2N of the gauge\ntheory is large and conventional perturbation theory breaks down. In this limit [119,120], the generating\nfunction for the correlation functions of O is then given in terms of the supergravity action SIIB[\u03c6O]\naccording to \u2329\nexp\n\u222b\nd4x JO(x)O(x)\n\u232a\n= exp\u2212SIIB [\u03a6O; J ] . (9.74)\n149\nThe IIB action on the right-hand side of the equation is evaluated on a configuration which solves the\nclassical field equations subject to the condition \u03a6O(x) = JO(x) on the four-dimensional boundary.\nIn most applications considered so far, the relation (9.74) has primarily been applied at the level of\nclassical supergravity, which corresponds to N \u2192\u221e, with g2N fixed and large, in the boundary theory\n[119\u2013132]. However, the full equivalence of IIB superstrings on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 and N = 4 supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory conjectured in [112] suggests that (9.74) should hold more generally, with quantum\nand stringy corrections to the classical supergravity action corresponding to g2 and 1\/(g2N) corrections\nin the N = 4 theory, respectively. The particular comparison that concerns us here is between Yang-\nMills instanton contributions to the correlators of O generated by the left-hand side of (9.74) and\nD-instanton corrections to the IIB effective action on the right-hand side.\nLet us describe these D-instanton effects in more detail. Before we look at some specific correlators,\nlet us consider in more detail the effects of D-instantons in the string theory [118] (closely following the\nmore detailed treatment in [117]). In [133], Green and Gutperle conjectured an exact form for certain\nnon-perturbative (in gst) corrections to certain terms in the Type IIB supergravity effective action.\nIn the present application, where the string theory is compactified on AdS5 \u00d7 S5, it is important for\nthe overall consistency of the Banks-Green prediction that the non-perturbative terms in the effective\naction do not alter the AdS5 \u00d7 S5 background, since the latter is conformally flat [118]. In particular,\nat leading order beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term in the derivative expansion, the IIB effective action\nis expected to contain a totally antisymmetric 16-dilatino effective vertex of the form [134,135]\n(\u03b1\u2032)\u22121\n\u222b\nd10x\n\u221a\ndetg e\u2212\u03c6\/2 f16(\u03c4, \u03c4\u00af) \u039b16 +H.c. (9.75)\nHere \u039b is a complex chiral SO(9, 1) spinor, and f16 is a certain weight (12,\u221212) modular form under\nSL(2,Z). At the same order in the derivative expansion there are other terms related to (9.75) by\nsupersymmetry and involving other modular forms [134\u2013136] and, in particular, fn(\u03c4, \u03c4\u00af ), with n = 4\nand 8. The modular symmetry is precisely S-duality of the Type IIB superstring, and although this\ndoes not completely determine the modular forms fn, for the n = 4 term, Green and Gutperle [133]\nmade the following conjecture, later proved in Ref. [137] and generalized to n 6= 4 in [135,136]:\nfn(\u03c4, \u03c4\u00af) = (Im\u03c4)\n3\/2\n\u2211\n(p,q)6=(0,0)\n(p + q\u03c4\u00af)n\u221211\/2(p+ q\u03c4)\u2212n+5\/2. (9.76)\nThese rather arcane expressions turn out to have the right modular properties, i.e. weight (n\u22124,\u2212n+4),\nand also have very suggestive weak coupling expansions [133\u2013135,138]:\ne\u2212\u03c6\/2fn = 32\u03c02\u03b6(3)g\u22124 \u2212 2\u03c0\n2\n3(9\u2212 2n)(7\u2212 2n) +\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\nGk,n , (9.77)\nwhere\nGk,n =\n(\n8\u03c02k\ng2\n)n\u22127\/2 {\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n}[\ne\u2212(8\u03c0\n2\/g2\u2212i\u03b8)k\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\nc4\u2212n,j\u2212n+4\n(\ng2\n8\u03c02k\n)j\n+ e\u2212(8\u03c0\n2\/g2+i\u03b8)k\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\ncn\u22124,j+n\u22124\n(\ng2\n8\u03c02k\n)j+2n\u22128 ] (9.78)\n150\nand the numerical coefficients are\ncn,r =\n(\u22121)n\u221a8\u03c0 \u0393(3\/2)\u0393(r \u2212 1\/2)\n2r\u0393(r \u2212 n + 1)\u0393(n+ 3\/2)\u0393(\u2212r \u2212 1\/2) . (9.79)\nAs previously, the summation over d in (9.78) runs over the integral divisors of k. Notice that, having\ntaken into account the conjectured correspondence (9.69) to the couplings of four-dimensional Yang-\nMills theory, the series (9.77) has the structure of a semi-classical expansion: the first two terms\ncorrespond to the tree and one-loop pieces, while the sum on k is interpretable as a sum on Yang-\nMills instanton number, the first and second terms in the square bracket being instantons and anti-\ninstantons, respectively (as dictated by the \u03b8 dependence). Each of these terms includes a perturbative\nexpansion around the instantons, although notice that the leading order anti-instanton contributions\nare suppressed by a factor of g4n\u221216 (so not suppressed for n = 4) relative to the leading order instanton\ncontributions.\nLet us focus on the leading semi-classical contributions to the fn; by this we mean, for each value of\nthe topological number k, the leading-order contribution in g2. For f16 and f8 the leading semi-classical\ncontributions come from instantons only and have the form\ne\u2212\u03c6\/2fn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nk-instanton\n= const \u00b7\n(\nk\ng2\n)n\u22127\/2\ne2\u03c0ik\u03c4\n\u2211\nd|k\n1\nd2\n, (9.80)\nneglecting g2 corrections. For the special case of f4 there is an identical anti-instanton contribution\nwith i\u03c4 \u2192 \u2212i\u03c4\u00af . Comparing with (9.73), we see that the terms in the square bracket in (9.78), which\nare non-perturbative in the string coupling, are interpreted as being due to D-instantons.\nFrom the effective vertex (9.75) one can construct Green\u2019s functions G16(x\n(1), . . . , x(16)) for sixteen\ndilatinos \u039b(x(l)), 1 \u2264 l \u2264 16, which live on the boundary of AdS5:\nG16 = \u3008\u039b(x(1))\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u039b(x(16))\u3009 \u223c (\u03b1\u2032)\u22121 e\u2212\u03c6\/2 f16 t16\n\u222b\nd4X d\u03c1\n\u03c15\n16\u220f\nl=1\nKF7\/2(X, \u03c1; x\n(l), 0) (9.81)\nsuppressing spinor indices. Here KF7\/2 is the bulk-to-boundary propagator for a spin-\n1\n2\nDirac fermion of\nmass m = \u22123\n2\nL\u22121 and scaling dimension \u2206 = 7\n2\n[119, 120, 123,139]:\nKF7\/2(X, \u03c1; x, 0) = K4(X, \u03c1; x, 0)\n(\n\u03c11\/2\u03b35 \u2212 \u03c1\u22121\/2(x\u2212X)n\u03b3n\n)\n(9.82)\nwith\nK4(X, \u03c1; x, 0) =\n\u03c14(\n\u03c12 + (x\u2212X)2)4 . (9.83)\nIn these expressions the x(l) are four-dimensional spacetime coordinates for the boundary of AdS5 while\n\u03c1 is the fifth, radial, coordinate. The quantity t16 in Eq. (9.81) is (in the notation of Ref. [117]) a\n16-index antisymmetric invariant tensor which enforces Fermi statistics and ensures, inter alia, that\nprecisely 8 factors of \u03c11\/2\u03b35 and 8 factors of \u03c1\n\u22121\/2\u03b3n are picked out in the product over KF7\/2. It is not\ndifficult to see that the form of (9.81) matches precisely the large-N instanton contribution to the 16-\npoint correlator in the gauge theory (9.62). In particular, the dilatino corresponds, on the field theory\n151\nside, to the fermionic composite operator defined in (9.59) [117]. This shows that not only does the\nform of the D-instanton collective coordinate integral match the large-N instanton collective coordinate\nintegral, but, in addition, the various bulk-to-boundary propagators on the supergravity side arise in\nthe field theory as operator insertions evaluated in the large-N instanton background. In the case of\nG16, and related correlators, because of the nature of the saddle-point solution, the insertions have the\nform of k times the same insertion in the theory with gauge group SU(2) at the one-instanton level\n(precisely the case considered in [117]).\nOf course this equivalence between D-instanton and Yang-Mills instanton effects in correlation func-\ntions extends to the other cases, G8 and G4, related by supersymmetry. Note that there is no explicit\ndependence in these expressions on the coordinates on S5; in particular, the propagator does not depend\non them. This is because G16, G8 and G4 are correlators of operators whose supergravity associates are\nconstant on S5. Generalizations involving non-trivial dependence on S5 are possible [21].\nAs emphasized above, the comparison between the Yang-Mills and supergravity descriptions can\nbe quantitative if and only if there exists a non-renormalization theorem that allows one to relate\nthe small g2N to the large g2N behaviour of chiral correlators such as Gn, as has been suggested in\nRefs. [140]. In the absence of such a theorem the best one can hope for is that qualitative features of\nthe agreement persist beyond leading order while the exact numerical factor in each instanton sector\ndoes not, in analogy with the mismatch in the numerical pre-factor between weak and strong coupling\nresults for black-hole entropy [120]. In our view, however, our results provide strong evidence in favor\nof such a non-renormalization theorem for the correlators Gn, for the following reason. Consider the\nplanar diagram corrections to the leading semi-classical (i.e. g2N \u2192 0) result for, say, G16, Eq. (9.62).\nIn principle, these would not only modify the above result by an infinite series in g2N, but also, at\neach order in this expansion, and independently for each value of k, they would produce a different\nfunction of spacetime. The fact that the leading semi-classical form for G16 that we obtain is not\nonly k-independent, but already reproduces the spacetime dependence of the D-instanton\/supergravity\nprediction exactly, strongly suggests that such diagrammatic corrections (planar and otherwise) must\nvanish. (Note there are necessary subleading corrections, both in 1\/N and in g2, to our leading semi-\nclassical results.) By evaluating the possible form of non-perturbative corrections on the string theory\nside of the correspondence, it has been argued that the non-renormalization theorem is rather natural\n[141]; however, there is still no purely field theoretic proof.\nIt is interesting to generalize the relation of large-N instantons in other conformal gauge theories\nto the D-instantons via the more general AdS\/CFT correspondences. This has been done for the finite\nN = 2 theories with product gauge group SU(N)k in [111], the N = 4 Sp(N) and SO(N) theories\nin [108] and for the finite N = 2 Sp(N) theories in [109, 110].\nThe finite N = 2 theory with gauge group SU(N) and 2N fundamental hypermultiplets has not yet\nbeen discussed in this respect. However, it is not difficult to find a set-up which can be used to discuss\nthis case. Here we sketch the details. The idea is to consider the finite N = 2 theory with product\ngauge group SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) and matter in bi-fundamental representations of the gauge group. This\ntheory can be realized, as explained in \u00a7X.2.5, on the world-volume of N D3-branes lying transverse to\n152\nthe orbifold R2 \u00d7 (R4\/Z2), where Z2 acts by inversion. The near horizon geometry of the D3-branes is\nAdS5 \u00d7 S5\/Z2, where Z2 acts on S5, realized as x2a = 1 by taking x3, x4, x5, x6 \u2192 \u2212x3,\u2212x4,\u2212x5,\u2212x6,\nleaving x1 and x2 fixed. So the AdS\/CFT correspondence in this case involves Type IIB string theory\non the AdS5 \u00d7 S5\/Z2 background. Notice that the Z2 leaves an S1 \u2282 S5 fixed and so in this case the\ndual geometry is not smooth. Now consider instanton effects in one of the SU(N) gauge group factors.\nAt leading order in such an instanton background, the adjoint-valued fields of the other gauge remain\nzero and so the instanton effects in question are identical to the SU(N) theory with 2N hypermultiplets\n(the latter arising from the bi-fundamental hypermultiplets of the original theory). On the string theory\nside, these instanton effects of charge k will be related to k fractional D-instantons. These fractional D-\ninstantons are to be though of as D-strings which are wrapped around the non-trivial S2 of the smooth\nresolution of the orbifold R4\/Z2 in the limit that the S\n2 cycle collapses. In the near-horizon geometry\nthese fractional instantons are consequently stuck at the orbifold singularity of S1 \u2282 S5\/Z2. So the\nfractional D-instanton collective coordinate integral involves an integral over the six dimensional space\nAdS5 \u00d7 S1 rather than ten-dimensions. Furthermore, this measure includes, in analogy with (9.72),\na partition function of six-dimensional SU(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions.\nThis is precisely what is seen in the large-N instanton collective coordinate integral (9.51). It would be\ninteresting to extend the analysis to particular correlation functions in order to place the relationship\non the same footing as the N = 4 case.\n153\nX Instantons as Solitons in Higher Dimensions and String\nTheory\nInstantons are classical solutions of Euclidean gauge theories in four-dimensional spacetime with finite\naction. They are consequently localized in spacetime rather than space. However, it will turn out to be\nrewarding to think about instantons in gauge theories in dimensions greater than four. In these other\ncontexts, if the higher-dimensional theories are defined in Minkowski space then the instanton solutions\nhave an interpretation as solitons. For example, consider five-dimensional gauge theories. We can\neasily take an instanton solution of four-dimensional gauge theory and embed it in the five-dimensional\ntheory, by identifying the coordinates xn, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, on which the instanton solution depends, with\nthe Euclidean subspace of the five-dimensional Minkowski space70 coordinates yN , N = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with\nyn \u2261 xn, n = 1, 2, 3, 4. The resulting solution of the five-dimensional Yang-Mills equations is then\nindependent of the time coordinate y0. The solution, which had finite action in four dimensions, now\nhas finite energy in five dimensions and so is interpreted as a lump localized in space but evolving\nin time. In other words, the instanton is a particle-like soliton in five dimensions. Adding an extra\ndimension yields a much richer system: instantons in four-dimensional gauge theories have no dynamics,\nbut when lifted to five dimensions they can move in the four dimensional space and have complicated\ndynamics.\nWe can continue this process of embedding instantons in gauge theories of even higher dimension. In\nsix dimensions, the embedded instanton solutions are independent of two coordinates and so, thinking\nof one of them as a time direction, means the solution is extended in a single space direction; in\nother words, it is a string-like \u201cdefect\u201d. In seven dimensions, one gets a membrane and so on. Let us\nintroduce some modern terminology, arising originally in the context of supergravity and string theory,\nwhich affords us a certain brevity in talking about these more exotic possibilities. Consider gauge\ntheories in D-dimensional Minkowski space. An instanton embedded in this theory will be independent\nof D \u2212 4 coordinates (one being the time). This means that the solution will be extended in D \u2212 5\nspatial dimensions. Such a configuration is called a \u201c(D \u2212 5)-brane\u201d. The case with D = 4, describes\na solution which is localized in both space and time dimensions and this is precisely the situation for\nthe original instanton of four-dimensional gauge theory. This case is therefore a \u201c(\u22121)-brane\u201d. For\nD = 5, the solution is localized in space, but not time, and so the instanton lump-like soliton of five-\ndimensional gauge theory is a 0-brane. It may seem strange to think about instanton solutions in higher\ndimensional gauge theories but one of the major lessons of string theory and its generalizations is that\nit is compulsory to think in arbitrary numbers of dimensions and there are big advantages in doing so.\nWe will show how the instanton moduli space plays an important ro\u02c6le in describing the dynamics of\ninstanton-branes in higher-dimensional gauge theories. In \u00a7X.1.1 we begin by discussing the case of the\npure gauge instanton. Supersymmetric generalizations will be considered in \u00a7X.2. It is worth pointing\nout that much of the analysis for instantons is very closely related to the problem of describing the\nsemi-classical behaviour of monopoles in supersymmetric gauge theories described in Refs. [142\u2013144],\nand references therein. In particular the description of instanton lumps in five-dimensional gauge\n70In Minkowski space we choose a metric \u03b7MN = diag(\u22121, 1, . . . , 1).\n154\ntheory with either 4 or 8 supercharges (corresponding to N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetry in four\ndimensions) is closely related to the description of monopoles in four-dimensional gauge theories, with\nN = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetry, respectively, since both involve a quantum mechanical \u03c3-model\non the appropriate moduli space. In both cases, the instanton and monopole moduli space are both\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler spaces and so the structure of the \u03c3-models is identical. The main difference is that the\n\u03c3-model in the instanton case admits a straightforward linear realization via the ADHM hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient construction while in the monopole case the analogous quotient construction based on Nahm\u2019s\nequations is somewhat more complicated.\nAfter we have described the dynamics of instanton branes, we will, in \u00a7X.3 describe how such\nobjects appear naturally in string theory. In this context they correspond to D-branes dissolved within\nother higher-dimensional D-branes. We will show how solving for the low energy dynamics of these\nconfigurations of D-branes actually leads directly to the instanton calculus. Not only is the ADHM\nconstruction obtained directly, but also the leading order expression for the collective coordinate integral\nfor the N = 4 and N = 2 supersymmetric theories. We also briefly describe how the actual profile of\nthe instanton can be obtained by using a suitable probe brane.\nX.1 Non-supersymmetric instanton branes\nWe begin with the case of pure gauge theory. The key idea, which originated with Manton [145] and\nwas elaborated by Ward in the context of a 2 + 1-dimensional model [146], is that the dynamics of\nslowly moving solitons can be approximated by assuming that the evolution is adiabatic in the moduli\nspace of classical solutions. In many cases involving lumps the time evolution of the system is governed\nby the geodesic motion on the moduli space with respect to the Levi-Civita connection induced by the\nmetric that arises as the inner-product of the zero modes (2.32). The intuitive idea that lies behind\nthis approximation is that, for sufficiently low velocities, the non-zero modes of the fields are only very\nweakly excited and therefore it is consistent to ignore these modes to leading order.\nIn our case we start with D > 4-dimensional gauge theory in Minkowski space with coordinates yM ,\nM = 0, 1, . . . , D \u2212 1 having the conventional action71\nS =\n1\n2g2D\n\u222b\ndDyTrN FMNF\nMN . (10.1)\nHere, gD is the gauge coupling in D dimensions which has dimensions of [L]\n(D\u22124)\/2.\nWe now consider how to embed an instanton in the D-dimensional theory. To this end, we decom-\npose D-dimensional Minkowski space into D \u2212 4-dimensional Minkowski space and four-dimensional\nEuclidean space, by taking yM = (\u03bea, xm), a = 0, . . . , p, where p = D \u2212 5, and m = 1, 2, 3, 4. We now\nembed the instanton solution in the subspace xm by taking\nAM(y) = (0, Am(x;X)) , (10.2)\n71In this and following sections, we will choose a normalization for the fields where the coupling constant appears\noutside the action. So the field strength, for instance, has no factor of g in front of the commutator: FMN = \u2202MAN \u2212\n\u2202NAM + [AM , AN ].\n155\nwhere Am(x;X) is the instanton solution constructed in \u00a7II (with coupling g set to 1). Recall that X\u00b5\ndenote the collective coordinates of Mk. This ansatz obviously satisfies the equations-of-motion of the\nD-dimensional theory and represents an object extended in p = D\u2212 5-space dimensions, i.e. a p-brane.\nX.1.1 The moduli space approximation\nManton\u2019s moduli space approximation amounts to modelling the dynamics of the p-brane by allowing\ndependence on the transverse coordinates \u03bea (so including time \u03be0) to enter implicitly through the\ncollective coordinates. Of course, the original classical solution with \u03bea-dependent collective coordinates\nAN (0, x;X(\u03be)) does not satisfy the classical equations-of-motion. The idea is that for sufficiently slowly\nvarying X\u00b5(\u03be) it is almost a solution. The point can be illustrated with the position coordinates of\nthe centre of the instanton Xn. In this case we know the exact solution for motion in time t \u2261 \u03be0\nwith constant velocity because we can Lorentz-boost the static solution. The boosted solution only\napproximates AN (0, x;Xn = vnt) if the velocity |v| \u226a 1.\nThe moduli space approximation is an expansion in powers of \u03bea derivatives. In order to find\nthe leading order effective dynamics we have to substitute the instanton solution with \u03bea-dependent\ncollective coordinates into the action. This then yields an effective action for the collective coordinates\nnow interpreted as fields on the p + 1-dimensional world-volume of the p-brane: X\u00b5(\u03be). In order\nthat the effective action is at least quadratic order in the \u03bea derivatives, we must ensure that the\nequations-of-motion are satisfied to linear order in the \u03bea derivatives. In components (Aa, An), the\nequations-of-motion, DNFMN = 0, are\nDmFmn +Da(\u2202aAn \u2212DnAa) = 0 , (10.3a)\nDn(DnAa \u2212 \u2202aAn) +DbFab = 0 . (10.3b)\nNow we substitute in the \u03be-dependent instanton solution An = An(x;X(\u03be)). To linear order in \u03be\na we\ncan ignore the second term in (10.3a) and the second term in (10.3b); this leaves\n( \u2202An\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 \u2212DnAa\n)\n= 0 , (10.4)\nfor Aa. Notice that this equation is very similar to the background gauge condition for an instanton\nzero mode (2.31). Indeed, if we take72\nAa = \u2126\u00b5\u2202aX\n\u00b5 , (10.5)\nwhere \u2126\u00b5 is the compensating gauge transformation associated to the collective coordinate X\n\u00b5, then\n(10.4) is satisfied by virtue of (2.31). Since Aa is linear in \u2202aX\n\u00b5, it is then trivial to see that the ansatz\nAN =\n(\n\u2126\u00b5\u2202aX\n\u00b5(\u03be), An(x;X(\u03be))\n)\n, (10.6)\nsatisfies the equations-of-motion (10.3a)-(10.3b) to linear order in \u03bea-derivatives. In making this ansatz,\nwe have fixed the gauge symmetry of the theory in a rather unconventional way. We are working in the\n72The following discussion and its supersymmetric generalization is motivated by the treatment of the analogous\nmonopole problem in Refs. [142, 144].\n156\ngauge where A0 = \u2126\u00b5\u22020X\n\u00b5. Of course we could always return to a more familiar gauge, say A0 = 0, by\nperforming a gauge transformation on the ansatz.\nSince the \u03bea-dependent expression (10.6) is only an solution of the equations-of-motion to linear\norder in \u03bea derivatives, it will now contribute non-trivially to the action at quadratic order:\nS(2) =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be d4x trN \u03b4\u00b5An(x;X(\u03be))\u2202\naX\u00b5(\u03be) \u03b4\u03bdAn(x;X(\u03be))\u2202aX\n\u03bd(\u03be)\n= \u2212 1\n2g2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be g\u00b5\u03bd(X)\u2202\naX\u00b5\u2202aX\n\u03bd ,\n(10.7)\nwhere g\u00b5\u03bd(X) is the metric tensor on the instanton moduli space defined in (2.32).\nThe effective collective coordinate dynamics embodied in (10.7) has the form of a \u03c3-model in p+1-\ndimensions whose target space is the moduli space Mk. The classical collective coordinate dynamics\nfollows from the equation-of-motion\n\u2202a\u2202aX\n\u00b5 + 1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bd\n\u2202g\u03c1\u03c3\n\u2202X\u03bd\n\u2202aX\u03c1\u2202aX\n\u03c3 = 0 . (10.8)\nFor the case with D = 5, where the instanton is a lump in five dimensions, this is simply the equation\nfor geodesics in Mk.\nX.2 Supersymmetric instanton branes\nIn this section, we will investigate how the description of instanton-branes extends to the supersym-\nmetric theories. Necessarily the theories must have extended supersymmetry from the four-dimensional\nperspective, because the N = 1 theory cannot be obtained by dimensional reduction from higher di-\nmensions. Since theories with the same number of supercharges are related by dimensional reduction,\nwe loose no loss of generality by considering the theories in their maximal dimension: D = 10 for the\ntheory having 16 supersymmetries (N = 4 in D = 4) and D = 6 for the theory having 8 supersymme-\ntries (N = 2 in D = 4). In the last section we have shown how the moduli space approximation involves\na p + 1 = D \u2212 4-dimensional \u03c3-model with Mk as target. In the supersymmetric case, we expect the\nmoduli space approximation to lead to a supersymmetric \u03c3-model with the appropriate number of su-\npersymmetries. Since an instanton breaks half the supersymmetries of the parent theory (see \u00a7IV.2.3),\nwe expect this \u03c3-model to manifest half the supersymmetries; i.e. have 8 supercharges, in the p = 5\ncase, and 4 supercharges in the p = 1 case. Furthermore, the supersymmetry in both cases is chiral,\nbeing N = (0, 1) in six spacetime dimensions and N = (0, 4) in two spacetime dimensions, respectively.\nIt is a well-established fact that \u03c3-models with the relevant kinds of supersymmetry only exist in these\ndimensions if the target space is hyper-ka\u00a8hler [147\u2013149]. In some respects, the very fact that instantons\ncan be embedded as branes in the higher-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories \u201cproves\u201d that the\ninstanton moduli space Mk has to be hyper-Ka\u00a8hler.\nWhat is interesting about these \u03c3-models is that on Wick rotation and complete dimensional reduc-\ntion to zero dimensions their partition functions reproduce the leading-order semi-classical expression\n157\nfor the collective coordinate integral of the instanton calculus. This includes both the volume form on\nthe instanton moduli space as well as the non-trivial instanton effective action. In fact the \u03c3-models\nhave both a non-linear realization, where the target space is directly Mk, but also, importantly, a linear\nrealization. In this second formulation there is an auxiliary supermultiplet involving a non-dynamical\nU(k) gauge field. It turns out that this linear formulation is directly related to the ADHM construc-\ntion, where the bosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints arise from integrating out Lagrange multiplier\nfields. However, there is more. When one dimensionally reduces these \u03c3-models there are certain kinds\nof deformation which can be added in form of very special potentials [143, 150, 151]. These potentials\nnaturally arise in the instanton calculus when one moves onto the Coulomb branch of the original theory\nand correspond to the adjoint-valued VEVs described in \u00a7V.2. In the 2-dimensional \u03c3-model example,\nwe also have the freedom to add other fields to the \u03c3-model which correspond in the N = 2 instanton\ncalculus to the Grassmann collective coordinates of hypermultiplet matter fields. We will subsequently\nshow how these \u03c3-models arise very naturally in the context of D-branes in string theory.\nX.2.1 Action, supersymmetry and equations-of-motion\nThe actions of the D = 6 and D = 10 theories with 8 and 16 supercharges, respectively, can both be\nwritten as\nS =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndDy trN\n{\n1\n2\nFMNF\nMN \u2212 i\u03a8\u00af\u0393MDM\u03a8\n}\n. (10.9)\nThe theory is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations\n\u03b4AN = \u2212\u039e\u00af \u0393N\u03a8 , (10.10a)\n\u03b4\u03a8 = i\u0393MN\u039eFMN . (10.10b)\nAs in the purely bosonic case, yM = (\u03bea, xm), where \u03be\na, a = 0, 1, . . . , p, are p + 1 = D \u2212 4-dimensional\nMinkowski space coordinates and xm, m = 1, 2, 3, 4, are four-dimensional Euclidean coordinates.\nThe spectrum of fields in both case consists of a gauge field AN = (Aa, An), with a = 0, 1 in D = 6\nand a = 0, 1, . . . , 5 in D = 10, and the minimal spinor \u03a8. (Our conventions for spinors are described in\nAppendix A.) In D = 6 this is a Weyl, while in D = 10 it is a Majorana-Weyl, spinor. In both cases,\nit is convenient to represent the \u0393-matrices using a tensor product notation that reflects the subgroups\nof the Lorentz group, SO(4)\u00d7 SO(1, 1) and SO(4)\u00d7 SO(5, 1), respectively:\n\u0393N =\n{\n\u0393a \u2297 \u03b35, 1\u2297 \u03b3n\n}\n, (10.11)\nwhere \u03b3n are the SO(4) \u03b3-matrices, (A.7), and \u0393a are the SO(1, 1) and SO(5, 1) \u0393-matrices, in the two\ncases, respectively. In both cases we write\n\u0393a =\n(\n0 \u03a3a\n\u03a3\u00afa 0\n)\n, (10.12)\nwhere, for SO(1, 1), \u03a3a = (1, 1) and \u03a3\u00afa = (\u22121, 1) and for SO(5, 1) the \u03a3-matrices are defined in (A.19).\n158\nIn both D = 6 and 10, in the tensor product notation (10.11), a Weyl spinor can be written\n\u03a8 =\n(\n1\n0\n)\n\u2297\n(\n1\n0\n)\n\u03bb\u03b1 +\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u2297\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , (10.13)\nwhere the \u03b1 and \u03b1\u02d9 are four-dimensional Euclidean space spinor indices. In the D = 6 case, \u03a8 is a\npseudo-real spinor and \u03bb\u03b1\u02d9 and \u03bb\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 are independent complex quantities. It is convenient in this case,\nto introduce the notion of a two-component symplectic real spinor (see Appendix A). In terms of the\ncomponent spinors, we define \u03bbA\u03b1\u02d9 and \u03bb\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA, A = 1, 2, via\n\u03bb1\u03b1 =\n1\u221a\n2\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2(\u03bb\u03b2)\n\u2020 , \u03bb2\u03b1 =\n1\u221a\n2\n\u03bb\u03b1 , \u03bb\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\n1 =\n1\u221a\n2\n\u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , \u03bb\u00af\u03b1\u02d92 = \u2212 1\u221a2\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9(\u03bb\u00af\u03b2\u02d9)\u2020 . (10.14)\nThe reason for choosing these definitions will emerge shortly. To accompany the two-component spinors\nwe also define the \u03a3-matrices\n\u03a3ABa = \u03a3a\u01eb\nAB , \u03a3\u00afaAB = \u03a3\u00afa\u01ebAB . (10.15)\nBy virtue of (10.14), the two-component spinors satisfy the pseudo-reality conditions\n(\u03bbA)\u2020 = \u03a3\u00af0AB\u03bb\nB , (\u03bb\u00afA)\n\u2020 = \u03a30AB\u03bb\u00afB . (10.16)\nIn the D = 10 case, \u03a8 is subjected to a Majorana spinor condition, which means in terms of the\ncomponent spinors, \u03bbA and \u03bb\u00afA, A = 1, 2, 3, 4, that\n(\u03bbA)\u2020 = \u03a3\u00af0AB\u03bb\nB , (\u03bb\u00afA)\n\u2020 = \u03a30AB\u03bb\u00afB . (10.17)\nNotice that this is identical in notion to the reality condition for the symplectic real spinor in D = 6\ncase (10.16) (and explains our choice of definition).\nIn terms of the spinors \u03bb and \u03bb\u00af, the action (10.9) is\nS =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndDy trN\n{\n1\n2\nFMNF\nMN + 2Dn\u03bb\u00afA\u03c3\u00afn\u03bbA \u2212 i\u03bb\u00afA\u03a3aABDa\u03bb\u00afB \u2212 i\u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaABDa\u03bbB\n}\n. (10.18)\nOur definitions have been chosen so that for \u03be-independent field configurations, the Lagrangian density\nis identical to minus that in (4.13) with the relation Aa = i\u03c6a and with the metric on the a-indices\nchanged from a Euclidean to Minkowski signature. The subgroups of the Lorentz group, SO(1, 1) and\nSO(5, 1), respectively, are identified, after the signature change, with part of the R-symmetry group of\nthe four-dimensional theory, namely SO(2) and SO(6), respectively. The other difference is the reality\ncondition on the spinors: compare (10.16) or (10.17) with the situation in the four-dimensional context\nwhere the spinors \u03bbA and \u03bb\u00afA are independently real.\nThe equations-of-motion which follow form (10.18) are\nDmFmn +DaFan = 2\u03c3\u00afn{\u03bbA, \u03bb\u00afA} , (10.19a)\n\/\u00afD\u03bbA = \u2212i\u03a3aABDa\u03bb\u00afB , (10.19b)\n\/D\u03bb\u00afA = \u2212i\u03a3\u00afaABDa\u03bbB , (10.19c)\nDnFna +DbFab = i\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bbA\u03bbB + i\u03a3ABa \u03bb\u00afA\u03bb\u00afB . (10.19d)\n159\nX.2.2 The moduli space approximation\nThe case of pure gauge theory the effective moduli space dynamics involved an expansion in \u03bea deriva-\ntives. When there are fermion fields are involved, we also allow the associated Grassmann collective\ncoordinates to depend on \u03bea. The moduli space approximation is then an expansion in n = n\u2202 +\n1\n2\nnf :\nthe number of \u03bea derivative plus half the number of Grassmann collective coordinates. The lowest\nnon-trivial term in the effective action are those terms of order n = 2 and in order to derive them we\nmust solve the equations-of-motions up to order n = 1.73\nThe equations to order n = 0 are solved, as in \u00a7X.1, by embedding the instanton solution as\nAN = (0, An(x;X(\u03be))). At the next order, n =\n1\n2\n, the fermions \u03bbA satisfy the covariant Weyl equation\n(4.24a) with the solution \u03bbA = \u039b(MA), where MA are the Grassmann collective coordinates. In order\nto extend the notion of the moduli space approximation to the supersymmetric theories we should also\nallow the Grassmann collective coordinates MA to depend on \u03bea.\nAt order n = 1, we have the following equation (generalizing (10.4))):\nDn\n( \u2202An\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 \u2212DnAa\n)\n= \u2212i\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bbA\u03bbB . (10.20)\nAs in the case of pure gauge theory, we can use the background gauge condition on the zero modes of\nAn to solve these equations for Aa. The new ingredient is the presence of the source bi-linear in fermion\nzero modes on the right-hand side. However, as the equation is linear in Aa we can take the linear\ncombination\nAa(x;X(\u03be),MA(\u03be)) = \u2126\u00b5(x;X(\u03be))\u2202aX\u00b5(\u03be) + i\u03c6a(x;X(\u03be),MA(\u03be)) , (10.21)\nwhere the Hermitian field \u03c6a satisfies\nD2\u03c6a = \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03bbA\u03bbB . (10.22)\nFortunately, we have already solved the covariant Laplace equation in the ADHM background a bi-\nfermion source (see \u00a7IV.3 and Appendix C Eq. (C.25)).\nX.2.3 The effective action\nWe now substitute our solution into the action of the theory and extract the terms of order n = 2. At\nthis order, the terms which contribute to the effective action are\nS(2) =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndDy trN\n{\nFnaF\nna \u2212 i\u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaABDa\u03bbB\n}\n. (10.23)\nWe now evaluate this expression. First of all, we have\nFna = DnAa \u2212 \u2202aAn = iDn\u03c6a \u2212 \u03b4\u00b5An\u2202aX\u00b5 (10.24)\n73Note that the possible cross-terms between fields of lower order, n = 0 and n = 1\/2, and fields of higher order,\nn = 3\/2 and n = 2, which potentially could contribute to the effective action at orders \u2264 2, actually vanish by the\nequations-of-motion.\n160\nand, writing \u03bbB = \u039b(MB),\n\u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaABDa\u03bbB = \u03bb\u03b1A\u03a3\u00afaAB\n{\n\u039b\u03b1(\u2202aMB) + \u2202\u03bb\nB\n\u03b1\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 \u2212 \u039b\u03b1\n(\u2202MB\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 + [Aa, \u03bb\nB]\n}\n= \u03bb\u03b1A\u03a3\u00afaAB\n{\n\u039b\u03b1(\u2202aMB) +\n( \u2202\u03bbB\u03b1\n\u2202X\u00b5\n+ [\u2126\u00b5, \u03bb\nB\n\u03b1 ]\u2212 \u039b\u03b1\n(\u2202MB\n\u2202X\u00b5\n))\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 + i[\u03c6a, \u03bb\nB\n\u03b1 ]\n}\n.\n(10.25)\nConsequently, using the gauge condition (2.24), the action (10.23) becomes\nS(2) =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndDy trN\n{\n\u03b4\u00b5An\u2202\naX\u00b5\u03b4\u03bdAn\u2202aX\n\u03bd \u2212 i\u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaAB\u039b(\u2202aMB)\n\u2212 i\u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaAB\n( \u2202\u03bbB\n\u2202X\u00b5\n+ [\u2126\u00b5, \u03bb\nB]\u2212 \u039b(\u2202MB\n\u2202X\u00b5\n))\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 \u2212Dn\u03c6aDn\u03c6a + \u03bbA\u03a3\u00afaAB[\u03c6a, \u03bbB]\n}\n.\n(10.26)\nThe first two terms can be evaluated using the inner-product formulae (2.32) and (4.37). The third\nterm can be evaluated using the identity (C.51) established in Appendix C:\n\u2202\u03bbA\n\u2202X\u00b5\n+ [\u2126\u00b5, \u03bb\nA] = \/D \u00af\u033aA\u00b5 + \u039b\n(\u2202MA\n\u2202X\u00b5\n)\n, (10.27)\nwhere\n\u00af\u033a\u03b1\u02d9A\u00b5 =\n1\n4\nU\u00af\n\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\nfM\u00afAU . (10.28)\nTherefore the third term in (10.26) involves the integral\u222b\nd4x trN \u03bb\nA \/D \u00af\u033aB\u00b5 . (10.29)\nWe can now use the fact that \/\u00afD\u03bbA = 0 to write this as\u222b\nd4x \u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n(\ntrN \u03bb\n\u03b1A \u00af\u033a\u03b1\u02d9B\n)\n. (10.30)\nUsing the asymptotic formulae in \u00a7II.4.3, one sees that the surface term at infinity vanishes and so\nthere is no contribution from the third term in (10.26). The final two terms (10.26) can be evaluated\nfollowing an identical analysis to the construction of the instanton effective action in \u00a7V.2. Notice that\nthis term vanishes in the p = 1 case.74\nPutting everything together we have\nS(2) =\n1\ng2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be trk\n{\n\u2212 1\n2\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X)\u2202\naX\u00b5\u2202aX\n\u03bd \u2212 2i\u03c02\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afA\u2202a\u00b5B \u2212 i\u03c02\u03a3\u00afaABM\u2032A\u2202aM\u2032B\n+ 1\n2\n\u03c02\u01ebABCDM\u00afAMBL\u22121M\u00afCMD\n}\n.\n(10.31)\nThis expression is somewhat schizophrenic because the bosonic fields X\u00b5 are the intrinsic coordinates\nwhile the fermionic fields MA are the ADHM variables, subject to the fermionic ADHM constraints.\nIn order to unify things we can procedure in two alternative ways, either writing everything in terms\n74Note the fact that we are in Minkowski space does not affect the result since\n(\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03a3\u00afaCD\n)\nMink\n=\n(\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u03a3\u00afaCD\n)\nEucl\n=\n2\u01ebABCD.\n161\nof intrinsic variables to Mk or in terms of the ADHM variables with the ADHM constraints explicitly\nimposed. Both viewpoints are worth developing.\nFirst the intrinsic expression. In \u00a7IV.2.2, we introduced \u03c8iA, i = 1, . . . , 2kN , the intrinsic Grassmann-\nvalued symplectic tangent vectors to Mk. In (10.31), the terms quadratic in the fermions are written\nin terms of the intrinsic objects \u03c8A as\ni\u03c02\u03a3\u00afaAB\n(\n2\u00b5\u00afA\u2202a\u00b5\nB +M\u2032A\u2202aM\u2032B\n)\n= 4\u03a3\u00afaAB\u2126\u02dc\n(\nM(\u03c8A, X),M(\u2202a\u03c8B, X) + \u2202M\nB\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5\n)\n(10.32)\nusing the linearity of MA on \u03c8A. The first term can be written in terms of the intrinsic symplectic\nmatrix \u2126ij(X) defined in (4.39). The relevant geometrical quantity corresponding to the second term\nis the symplectic spin connection on Mk. In Appendix B we explain in the context of the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler\nquotient construction how the connection \u2207 on the quotient space is inherited from the connection \u2207\u02dc on\nthe mother space M\u02dc by orthogonal projection to H. In a completely analogous way the spin connection\nfor symplectic tangent vectors on Mk is obtained from that of M\u02dc by projection via the fermionic ADHM\nconstraints. So since MA are subject to the fermionic ADHM constraints\n\u2126\u02dc(MA,\u2207XMB) = \u2126\u02dc(MA, \u2207\u02dcXMB) . (10.33)\nThen since M\u02dc is flat, we can identify the second term in (10.32) with\n4\u03a3\u00afaAB\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\niA \u03c9\u00b5\nj\nk\u2202aX\n\u00b5\u03c8kB , (10.34)\nwhere \u03c9\u00b5\ni\nj are the elements of the symplectic spin connection.\nThe final term, as we have explained in \u00a7V.2, involves a coupling to the symplectic curvature of Mk.\nWriting all the terms using in the intrinsic variables X\u00b5 and \u03c8iA, we have\nS(2) = \u2212 1\n2g2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be\n{\ng\u00b5\u03bd(X)\u2202\naX\u00b5\u2202aX\n\u00b5 + i\n2\n\u03a3\u00afaAB\u2126ij(X)\u03c8\niA(\u2202a\u03b4\nj\nk + \u03c9\u00b5\nj\nk\u2202aX\n\u00b5)\u03c8kB\n+ 1\n48\nRijkl(X)\u01ebABCD\u03c8\niA\u03c8jB\u03c8kC\u03c8lD\n} (10.35)\nIn both cases p = 1, 5, this is the action of a non-linear \u03c3-model with Mk as target with, as we shall show\nin \u00a7X.2.4, N = (0, 4) or N = (0, 1) supersymmetry, respectively. For references on two-dimensional\nN = (0, 4) theories see [148, 149], while for six-dimensional N = (0, 1) theories see [153, 154] and\nreferences therein.\nWe now follow the opposite philosophy and attempt to write the effective action (10.31) entirely in\nterms of the ADHM variables a\u03b1\u02d9 and MA. In this form, the bosonic, as well as the fermionic, ADHM\nconstraints are now implicit. We claim that the correct expression is\nS(2) =\n\u03c02\ng2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be trk\n{\n\u2212 4\u2202aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2202aw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 4\u2202aa\u2032n\u2202aa\u2032n \u2212 2i\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afA\u2202a\u00b5B \u2212 i\u03a3\u00afaABM\u2032\u03b1A\u2202aM\u2032B\u03b1\n+ 1\n4\n[\n\u03a3\u00afaABM\u00afAMB + 2i(a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2202aa\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u2202aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9)\n]\nL\n\u22121[\u03a3\u00afaCDM\u00afCMD + 2i(a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9\u2202aa\u03b2\u02d9 \u2212 \u2202aa\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b2\u02d9)]} . (10.36)\nWe must show that this reduces to (10.31) when we substitute a\u03b1\u02d9 = a\u03b1\u02d9(X). Firstly, we have to recall\nthe expression (2.117) for the metric on the quotient space in terms of the ADHM variables a\u03b1\u02d9(X). This\n162\naccounts for the first two terms in (10.36). Most of the fermionic terms in (10.36) are already present in\n(10.31) in particular the fermion quadrilinear term is equal to that in (10.31) by the \u03a3-matrix identity\n(A.20). We seem to have the additional terms dependent on a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2202aa\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u2202aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9, however this vanishes\nwhen we substitute a\u03b1\u02d9(X\n\u00b5) since\na\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u2202aa\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u2202aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 a\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\na\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\n\u2212 \u2202a\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\na\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n\u2202aX\n\u00b5 = 0 , (10.37)\nby virtue of the constraint (2.114).\nThe form (10.36) is motivated by the fact that one can introduce a non-dynamical U(k) (Hermitian)\ngauge field \u03c7a coupled to the fields via the covariant derivatives\nDaw\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2202aw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 iw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a , Daw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = \u2202aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 + i\u03c7aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , Daa\u2032n = \u2202aa\u2032n + i[\u03c7a, a\u2032n] ,\nDa\u00b5A = \u2202a\u00b5A \u2212 i\u00b5A\u03c7a , Da\u00b5\u00afA = \u2202a\u00b5\u00afA + i\u03c7a\u00b5\u00afA , DaM\u2032A = \u2202aM\u2032A + i[\u03c7a,M\u2032A] .\n(10.38)\nThe action (10.36) can then be written in the form of a gauge linear \u03c3-model\nS(2) = \u22124\u03c0\n2\ng2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be trk\n{\nDaw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9Daw\u03b1\u02d9 +Daa\u2032nDaa\u2032n + i2\u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afADa\u00b5B + i4\u03a3\u00afaABM\u2032ADaM\u2032B\n}\n. (10.39)\nRemember that the bosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints are imposed implicitly. This can be\nachieved directly by introducing, as in \u00a7VI.5, bosonic and fermionic Lagrange multipliers in the form\nof k \u00d7 k Hermitian matrix fields, ~D and \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A, respectively:\nSL.m. =\n4\u03c02i\ng2D\n\u222b\ndp+1\u03be trk\n{\n~D \u00b7 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9a\u00af\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 + \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA)\n}\n. (10.40)\nThe non-dynamical gauge field, along with the Lagrange multipliers then form a vector multiplet\n{\u03c7a, ~D, \u03c8\u00afA} of the supersymmetry appropriate to the p = 1 and p = 5 cases.\nX.2.4 Supersymmetry\nJust as the supersymmetry of the parent theory is inherited by the collective coordinates of instanton,\nwe expect the same to be true for the instanton branes. The only difference now is that the collective\ncoordinates are now fields and so the supersymmetry transformations will involve \u03bea derivatives.\nFrom (10.10a)-(10.10b), one finds\n\u03b4Am = i\u03be\nA\u03c3m\u03bb\u00afA + i\u03be\u00afA\u03c3\u00afm\u03bb\nA , (10.41a)\n\u03b4\u03bbA = i\u03a3abAB\u03be\nBFab + i\u03c3mn\u03be\nAFmn + \u03a3\naAB\u03c3m\u03be\u00afBFam . (10.41b)\nThese transformations are closely related to (4.23a) and (4.23b), respectively. (Indeed, by removing \u03bea\nderivatives and replacing Aa by i\u03c6a they are identical.) Now we let Am and \u03bb\nA take their ADHM values\nwith \u03bea-dependent collective coordinates and Aa as in (10.21). The variations lift to variations of the\ncollective coordinates in an almost identical way to those derived in \u00a7IV.5. The only difference, is an\nextra contribution from the final term in the variation of \u03bbA. Using (10.21), this term is\n\u2212i\u03a3aAB \/D\u03c6a\u03be\u00afB + \u03a3aAB\n(\n\u2202aAn \u2212 \u2126\u00b5\u2202aX\u00b5\n)\n\u03c3n\u03be\u00af\nA . (10.42)\n163\nThe first term, here, is identical to the final term in (4.23b) and so is already accounted by the analysis\nin \u00a7IV.5. It is the second term which is new.

(10.44)\nSo there is an extra \u03bea-derivative term, relative to (4.70), in the transformation of the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates:\n\u03b4MA = \u22124i\u03beA\u03b1 b\u03b1 + 2i\u03a3aABCa\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B + 2\u03a3aAB\u2202aa\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B ,\n\u03b4M\u00afA = \u22124i\u03be\u03b1Ab\u00af\u03b1 + 2i\u03a3aAB \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9BC\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a + 2\u03a3aAB\u2202aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B .\n(10.45)\nThese transformations are symmetries of the effective action (10.31). In counting the number of super-\nsymmetries, we do not include the trivial shifts of the fermions generated by \u03beA and this means that the\neffective theory of the instanton branes has half the number of supersymmetries of the parent theory:\nso 8 for the six-dimensional (p = 5) theory and 4 for the two-dimensional (p = 1) theory. In both cases\nthe supersymmetries are all anti-chiral the hence, using the usual convention, are denoted as N = (0, 1)\nand N = (0, 4), for p = 5 and p = 1, respectively.\nX.2.5 Relation to the instanton calculus\nThe instanton calculus for N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetry can be obtained as a particular limit of\nthe \u03c3-model described above. This limit involves performing a Wick rotation of the p + 1-dimensional\nworld-volume of the brane and then a dimensional reduction to zero dimensions. In this limit, the\nfield theory reduces to a matrix theory and the only part of the \u201cdynamics\u201d that remains, in the case\nwith p = 5 (8 supercharges) is the four-fermion coupling in (10.35). This four-fermion coupling then\nreproduces the quadrilinear coupling of the Grassmann collective coordinates described in \u00a7V.2. On\ntop of this, the collective coordinate integral of the instanton calculus is obtained directly from the\nWick rotated partition function of the dimensionally reduced \u03c3-model. This is most easily seen in the\ngauged linear \u03c3-model description of Eq. (10.39). On dimensional reduction the partition function of\nthe \u03c3 simply gives the instanton partition in the linearized version constructed in \u00a7VI.5. One can see\nthat the auxiliary variables {\u03c7a, ~D, \u03c8\u00afA} introduced in \u00a7VI.5 arise from the dimensional reduction of the\nfields of the vector multiplet of the \u03c3-model.\nIt is interesting to ask whether the constrained instanton formalism describing the Coulomb branch\nof the N = 2 and N = 4 theories can be re-produced in this way. To answer this question, we use\nthe fact that for our six-dimensional \u03c3-model with 8 supercharges, relevant to the N = 4 case, it\nis possible when dimensionally reducing to add a potential which do not break supersymmetry [150].\nThis potential term has the form of the inner product of a tri-holomorphic Killing vector field on the\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler target space. In fact the most general type of potential for an 8 supercharge \u03c3-model in\n6\u2212 l-dimensions involves the sum of the inner-products of l commuting tri-holomorphic Killing vector\n164\nfields [143,151]. At the level of the non-linear \u03c3-model the introduction of this potential can be described\nby non-trivial dimensional reduction of the Scherk-Schwarz kind [152]. At the level of the linear \u03c3-model\nwe can describe it as gauging an additional U(1)l symmetry, over and above U(k), corresponding to the\naction of the tri-holomorphic Killing vector fields, and then giving VEVs to the l components of the\nsix-dimensional gauge field \u03c7a that lie in the dimensionally reduced directions.\nIn the present setting of the instanton calculus, Mk admits a SU(N) tri-holomorphic action cor-\nresponding to global gauge transformation in the original SU(N) gauge theory. The action of these\ntransformations on the bosonic ADHM variables was described in \u00a7II.4.3. Under global gauge transfor-\nmations a\u2032n and M\u2032A are invariant, but\nw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 Uw\u03b1\u02d9 , \u00b5A \u2192 U\u00b5A . (10.46)\nCommuting actions can be obtained by considering global gauge transformations in the Cartan subgroup\nU(1)N\u22121 \u2282 SU(N) generated by diagonal matrices. We now gauge this symmetry and reduce to zero\ndimensions. This amounts to replacing the covariant derivatives in (10.39) by\nDaw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 \u2212iw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a \u2212 i\u03c60aw\u03b1\u02d9 , Daw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 i\u03c7aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 + iw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60a , Daa\u2032n \u2192 \u2212i[a\u2032n, \u03c7a] ,\nDa\u00b5A \u2192 \u2212i\u00b5A\u03c7a \u2212 i\u03c60a\u00b5A , Da\u00b5\u00afA \u2192 i\u03c7a\u00b5\u00afA + i\u00b5\u00afA\u03c60a , DaM\u2032A \u2192 \u2212i[M\u2032A, \u03c7a] .\n(10.47)\nwhere \u03c60a are six diagonal N \u00d7N matrices. It is easy to see that after integrating out the gauge field \u03c7a\none is left with the instanton effective action describing constrained instantons on the Coulomb branch\nof N = 4 gauge theory (6.94).\nIn a similar way, the constrained instanton calculus of the N = 2 theory can be obtained by gauging\nthe same U(1)N\u22121 symmetry and dimensionally reducing to zero dimensions the two-dimensional \u03c3-\nmodel with N = (0, 4) supersymmetry. In this case, there is another kind of generalization which plays\na ro\u02c6le in the instanton calculus. Since the N = (0, 4) supersymmetry is purely chiral it is possible\nto fermions of the opposite chirality which are singlet under the supersymmetry. This is precisely\nwhat is required to describe the instanton calculus when the N = 2 gauge theory involves additional\nmatter hypermultiplets. As described in \u00a7VI.3.2, instantons have additional fermion zero modes and\nthere are new Grassmann collective coordinates {Kf , K\u02dcf}. Consequently the \u03c3-model describing the\ncollective coordinate dynamics will have additional fermionic fields describing the fluctuations of the\nhypermultiplet Grassmann collective coordinates. These are incorporated in the two-dimensional \u03c3-\nmodel dynamics in precisely the same way as in description of monopole dynamics in an N = 2 theory\nwith hypermultiplets described in [144] (although in this reference the \u03c3-model is in one dimension,\ni.e., is a quantum mechanical system).\nX.3 Instantons and string theory\nThe most remarkable and unexpected developments of the instanton calculus has come with the real-\nization that the ADHM formalism arises naturally in the context of string theory. The point is that\nsupersymmetric instanton branes, as previously described in \u00a7X.2, arise when D-branes are \u201cabsorbed\u201d,\n165\nin a way to be made precise, on other D-branes. In certain respects, the string theory point-of-view\nprovides an \u201cexplanation\u201d for the rather mysterious ADHM construction in the sense that the ADHM\nvariables, constraints and the internal U(k) symmetry have a simple interpretation in terms of a con-\nventional (but auxiliary) gauge theory with gauge group U(k) (see Refs. [155\u2013157]). Moreover, the\nconnection is very explicit: not only can the ADHM gauge potential be derived [158] but the \u03c3-model\ndescribing the dynamics of instanton branes is obtained in a direct way [21]. Both are obtained in a\ncertain decoupling limit where stringy effects can be neglected. In this way one \u201cderives\u201d the leading-\norder semi-classical expression for the collective coordinate integral of the original gauge theory. Some\naspects of the relation between Yang-Mills and D-instantons, particularly for k = 1, are also discussed\nin Refs. [159, 160].\nX.3.1 The N = 4 instanton calculus\nWe begin by describing how the N = 4 instanton calculus can be recovered from string theory. The\nbasic idea is that the N = 4 theory with gauge group U(N) arises as the collective dynamics of N\nD3-branes in Type IIB string theory and, according to [156, 156], D-instantons located on the D3-\nbranes are equivalent to Yang-Mills instantons in the collective coordinate world-volume gauge theory.\nMore generally, Dp-branes located on a stack of D(p + 4)-branes appear as instanton p-branes in the\nworld-volume theory of the higher-dimensional branes. So our attention will focus a general system of\nk Dp-branes and N D(p+ 4)-branes.\nWe begin by briefly reviewing some basic facts about D-branes in Type II string theory [161]. There\nare two distinct ways to think of a Dp-brane. Firstly, it can be viewed as a brane-like soliton of the Type\nII supergravity in ten dimensions, the low energy limit of the string theory. In this respect, we expect\nthat in an appropriate limit its behaviour should be captured by a generalization of Manton\u2019s moduli\nspace dynamics: in this case some (p+1)-dimensional field theory on the world volume. Secondly, a Dp-\nbrane can be described as a p-dimensional hyper-plane on which open strings can end. The connection\nbetween these two points-of-view is that the massless states in the open string spectrum in the presence\nof the Dp-brane give rise to massless fields which propagate on the p + 1-dimensional world volume of\nthe D-brane and these massless modes are identified with the collective coordinates of the moduli space\napproximation.\nSpecifically, the massless modes or collective coordinates of a single Dp-brane come from a simple\ndimensional reduction to p + 1 dimensions of a U(1) vector multiplet of N = 1 supersymmetry in\nten dimensions. This supersymmetric theory, which has 16 supercharges, consequently describes the\nmoduli space dynamics of the D-brane. The action is (10.9) with D = 10 dimensionally reduced to\np + 1 dimensions. After dimensional reduction, the ten-dimensional gauge field AN , N = 0, 1, 2, . . .9,\nyields a p + 1 dimensional gauge field An, n = 0, . . . , p and 9 \u2212 p scalars \u03c6a, a = 1, . . . , 9 \u2212 p. In\nthe collective coordinate interpretation, the scalars specify the location of the D-brane in the 9 \u2212 p\ndimensions transverse to its world volume. The d = 10 multiplet also includes a Majorana-Weyl\nfermion \u03a8. The sixteen independent components of \u03a8 correspond to the sixteen fermion zero modes of\nthe D-brane. This number reflects the fact that the D-brane is a BPS configuration which breaks half\n166\nof the 32 supersymmetries of the Type II theory.\nRemarkably, the collective dynamics of a system of N parallel Dp-branes is obtained by simply\n\u201cnon-abelianizing\u201d the U(1) gauge group thereby replacing it with U(N). At low energies, the adjoint-\nvalued scalar fields can acquire VEVs breaking the gauge group to U(1)N describing a configuration\nof Dp-branes separated in the transverse directions. However, when two or more D-branes coincide,\nadditional states corresponding to open strings stretched between the two branes become massless\nleading to enhanced gauge symmetry [163]. In the maximal case, where all N Dp-branes coincide, the\nunbroken gauge group is U(N). The low-energy effective action for the world-volume theory can be\nobtained from dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theory (10.9) (with D = 10)\nwith gauge group U(N). Dimensional reduction to p + 1 dimensions proceeds by setting all spacetime\nderivatives in the reduced directions to zero. As in the case of a single Dp-brane, the ten-dimensional\ngauge field yields a p+ 1-dimensional, but now U(N)-valued, gauge field and 9\u2212 p real adjoint scalars.\nConfigurations with some or all of the D-branes separated in spacetime corresponds to the Coulomb\nbranch of the world-volume gauge theory. In terms of string theory parameters, the Yang-Mills coupling\nconstant in p + 1 dimensions is identified as\ng2p+1 = 2(2\u03c0)\np\u22122gst\u03b1\u2032(p\u22123)\/2 , (10.48)\nwhere gst is the string coupling constant, \u03b1\n\u2032 is the inverse string tension.\nIn the case of N parallel D3-branes, the low-energy effective theory on the brane world-volume\nis four-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N) and coupling\nconstant g2 = 4\u03c0gst. In this case we can also introduce a world-volume vacuum angle \u03b8 = 2\u03c0C\n(0) where\nC(0) is the VEV of the Ramond-Ramond scalar of the IIB theory. In general, the four-dimensional fields\nwhich propagate on the brane also have couplings to the ten-dimensional graviton and the other bulk\nclosed string modes. To decouple the four-dimensional theory from these bulk modes it is necessary to\ntake the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 with with g (i.e. gst) held fixed and small. This gives a weakly coupled gauge\ntheory on the D3-brane.\nA D-instanton (or D(\u22121)-brane) corresponds to the extreme case where the dimensional reduction\nis complete and the world-volume is a single point in Euclidean spacetime.75 Correspondingly, rather\nthan having finite mass or tension, a single D-instanton has finite action\n2\u03c0(g\u22121st \u2212 iC(0)) \u2261 \u22122\u03c0i\u03c4 , (10.49)\nusing the relations (10.48). Hence, a D-instanton carries the same action as a Yang-Mills instanton in the\nworld volume gauge theory of N D3-branes described above. From our discussion above, the collective\ncoordinates of a charge-k D-instanton correspond to a U(k) vector multiplet of ten-dimensional N = 1\nsupersymmetric gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero spacetime dimensions. As we dimensionally\nreduce to zero dimensions, the fields become both c-number and Grassmann matrix degrees-of-freedom.\nIn addition to a constant part equal to \u22122\u03c0ik\u03c4 , the action of a charge-k D-instanton also depends on\nthe collective coordinates via the (Wick rotated) dimensional reduction of (10.9) (with D = 10):\nS = \u2212 1\n2g20\ntrk [AM , AN ]\n2 +\ni\ng20\ntrk \u03a8\u00af\u0393M [AM ,\u03a8] . (10.50)\n75So before dimensional reduction, we must Wick rotate the D = 10 action (10.9) to Euclidean space.\n167\nIn addition to the manifest SO(10) symmetry under ten-dimensional rotations, the action is trivially\ninvariant under translations of the form AM \u2192 AM + xM1[k]\u00d7[k]. Hence k\u22121trk AM , which corresponds\nto the abelian factor of the U(k) gauge group, is identified with the position of the centre of the charge\nk D-instanton in R10.\nThe action (10.50) inherits the supersymmetries (10.10a)-(10.10b) along with linear shifts in the\nGrassmann collective coordinates:\n\u03b4AM = \u2212\u039e\u00af\u0393M\u03a8 ,\n\u03b4\u03a8 = i\u0393MN\u039e[AM , AN ] + 1[k]\u00d7[k] \u03b5 .\n(10.51)\nThe sixteen components of the Majorana-Weyl SO(10) spinor \u03b5 correspond to the sixteen zero modes\nof the D-instanton configuration generated by the action of the D = 10 supercharges. Like the bosonic\ntranslation modes, these modes live in the abelian factor of the corresponding U(k) field, k\u22121trk\u03a8. In\ncontrast, the Majorana-Weyl spinor \u039e parameterizes the sixteen supersymmetries left unbroken by the\nD-instanton.\nIn ordinary field theory, as we have seen, instantons yield non-perturbative corrections to correlation\nfunctions via their saddle-point contribution to the Euclidean path integral. In the semi-classical limit,\nthe path-integral in each topological sector reduces to an ordinary integral over the instanton moduli\nspace (5.14). The extent to which similar ideas apply to D-instantons is less clear, in part because\nstring theory lacks a second-quantized formalism analogous to the path integral. Despite this, there is\nconsiderable evidence that D-instanton contributions to string theory amplitudes also reduce to integrals\nover collective coordinates at weak string coupling [133]. In this case the relevant collective coordinates\nare the components the ten-dimensional U(k) gauge field AM and their superpartners \u03a8 which in the\ndimensional reduction end up as matrices. According to Green and Gutperle [133, 138, 164, 165], the\ncharge-k D-instanton contributions to the low-energy correlators of the IIB theory are consequently\ngoverned by the partition function\nZk =\ne\u22122\u03c0k(e\n\u2212\u03c6+iC(0))\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd10Ad16\u03a8 e\u2212S . (10.52)\nThis partition function can be thought of as the collective coordinate integration measure for k D-\ninstantons. In particular, the leading-order semi-classical contribution of k D-instantons to the correla-\ntors of the low-energy supergravity fields is obtained by inserting into (10.52) the classical value of each\nfield. The collective coordinate action (10.50) does not depend on the U(1) components of the fields AM\nand \u03a8. Hence, to obtain a non-zero answer, the inserted fields must, at the very least, involve a product\nof at least sixteen fermions to saturate the corresponding Grassmann integrations. As in field theory\ninstanton calculations, the resulting amplitudes can be interpreted in terms of an instanton-induced\nvertex in the low-energy effective action. The spacetime position of the D-instanton, XM = k\n\u22121trkAN ,\nis interpreted as the location of the vertex. In particular, the work of Green and Gutperle [133] has\nfocused on a term of the form R4 in the IIB effective action (here R is the ten-dimensional curvature\ntensor) and its supersymmetric completion.\nSo far we have only considered D-instantons in the IIB theory in a flat ten-dimensional background\nand in the absence of other branes. In order to make contact with four-dimensional gauge theory we need\n168\nto understand how these ideas apply to D-instantons in the presence of D3-branes. In particular we wish\nto determine how the D-instanton collective coordinate integral (10.52) is modified by the introduction\nof N parallel D3-branes. Conversely, in the absence of D-instantons, the theory on the four-dimensional\nworld volume of the D3-branes is N = 4 Yang-Mills with gauge group U(N). Hence a related question\nis how the D-instantons appear from the point-of-view of the four-dimensional world-volume theory of\nthe D3 branes. In fact, the brane configuration considered here is a special case of a system which has\nbeen studied intensively involving k Dp-branes in the presence of N D(p + 4)-branes, with all branes\nparallel. As we will review below, the lower-dimensional branes corresponds to Yang-Mills instantons\nin the world-volume gauge theory of the higher-dimensional branes [156]. We begin by reviewing the\nmaximal case p = 5, which was first considered (in the context of Type I string theory) by Witten [155].\nThe cases with p < 5 then follow by straightforward dimensional reduction.\nWe start by considering a theory of k parallel D5-branes (in Type IIB string theory) in isolation. As\nabove, the world-volume theory is obtained by dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional N = 1 Yang-\nMills theory with gauge group U(k). The resulting theory in six dimensions has two Weyl supercharges\nof opposite chirality and, therefore, conventionally has N = (1, 1) supersymmetry.76 After dimensional\nreduction, the SO(10) Lorentz group of the Minkowski theory in ten dimensions is broken to H =\nSO(5, 1) \u00d7 SO(4). The SO(5, 1) factor is the Lorentz group of the six-dimensional theory while the\nSO(4) is an R-symmetry. The ten-dimensional gauge field AM splits up into an adjoint scalar in the\nvector representation of SO(4) and a six dimensional gauge field. Explicitly we set\nAM = i\n(\n\u03c7a,\n1\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\na\u2032n\n)\n, a = 1, . . . , 6; n = 1, . . . , 4 . (10.53)\nSince, in our conventions, AM is anti-Hermitian, both a\n\u2032\nn and \u03c7a are Hermitian. The factor of (2\u03c0\u03b1\n\u2032)\u22121\nhas been inserted so that a\u2032n will subsequently be identified with the quantity of the same name in the\ninstanton calculus.\nIn order to describe the fermion content of the theory consider the covering group of H , H\u00af =\nSU(4)\u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R. We introduce spinor indices A = 1, 2, 3, 4 and \u03b1, \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2 corresponding to\neach factor. As mentioned above, a ten-dimensional Majorana-Weyl spinor is decomposed under H\u00af as\n16\u2192 (4, 2, 1)\u2295 (4\u00af, 1, 2) , (10.54)\nso contains two Weyl spinors of opposite chirality in six dimensions. With the representation of the\nten-dimensional Clifford algebra as in (10.11) a Majorana-Weyl fermion, as in (10.13), can be written\n\u03a8 =\n1\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n(\n1\n0\n)\n\u2297\n(\n1\n0\n)\nM\u2032A\u03b1 +\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u2297\n(\n0\n1\n)\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A , (10.55)\nAltogether, the fields (\u03c7a, a\n\u2032\nn,M\u2032A\u03b1 , \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A) form a vector multiplet of N = (1, 1) supersymmetry in six\ndimensions. In terms of an N = (0, 1) subalgebra, the N = (1, 1) vector multiplet splits up into an\nN = (0, 1) vector multiplet containing {\u03c7a, \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A} and an adjoint hypermultiplet containing {a\u2032n,M\u2032A\u03b1 }.\nThe action of the N = (1, 1) theory is deduced from (10.18) (with gD \u2192 g6):\nS =\n1\ng26\n(\nSgauge +\n1\n4\u03c02\u03b1\u20322\nS\n(a)\nmatter\n)\n\u2261 4\u03c0\n2\ng2p+5\n(\n4\u03c02\u03b1\u20322Sgauge + S\n(a)\nmatter\n)\n, (10.56)\n76Some convenient facts about six-dimensional supersymmetry are reviewed in [166].

(10.58)\nHere, the covariant derivatives are for adjoint-valued fields: Daa\u2032n = \u2202aa\u2032n + i[\u03c7a, a\u2032n], etc. For later\nconvenience we have introduced a real anti-self dual auxiliary field for the vector multiplet, Dmn =\n\u2212\u2217Dmn), transforming in the adjoint of SU(2)R. Since Dmn is anti-self-dual we can write\nDmn = tr2(~\u03c4\u03c3\u00afmn) \u00b7 ~D , (10.59)\nwhich defines the 3-vector ~D. We have also used the relation g2p+5 = (2\u03c0)\n4\u03b1\u20322g2p+1.\nFollowing [156], the next step is to introduce N D9-branes of the Type IIB theory whose world-\nvolume fills the ten-dimensional spacetime.77 These will give rise on dimensional reduction to the N\nD3-branes in the p = \u22121 case on which we will eventually focus. The world volume theory of the\nD9-branes in isolation (i.e. in the absence of the D5-branes) is simply ten-dimensional U(N) N = 1\nsupersymmetric gauge theory. As explained by Douglas [156], the effective action for this system\ncontains a coupling between the 2-form field strength F of the world-volume gauge field and a 6-form\nfield C(6) which comes from the Ramond-Ramond sector of the Type IIB theory. This coupling has the\nform, \u222b\nC(6) \u2227 F \u2227 F, (10.60)\nwhere the integration is over the ten-dimensional world-volume of the D9-branes. The same six-form\nfield C(6) also couples minimally to the Ramond-Ramond charge carried by D5-branes. Hence a con-\nfiguration of the U(N) gauge fields with non-zero second Chern class, F \u2227 F , acts as a source for\nD5-brane charge. More concretely, if the D9-brane gauge field is chosen to be independent of six of\nthe world-volume dimensions and an ordinary Yang-Mills instanton is embedded in the remaining four\ndimensions, then the resulting configuration has the same charge density as a single D5-brane. Both\nobjects are also BPS saturated and therefore they also have the same tension. Further confirmation of\nthe identification of D5-branes on a D9-brane as instantons was found in [156] where the gauge-field\nbackground due to a Type I D5-brane was shown to be self-dual via its coupling to the world-volume\nof a D1-brane probe.\nAs described above, D5-branes appear as BPS saturated instanton configurations on the D9-brane\nwhich break half of the supersymmetries of the world-volume theory. Conversely, the presence of D9-\nbranes also breaks half the supersymmetries of the D5-brane world-volume theory described by the\naction (10.56). Specifically, the N = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the six-dimensional theory is broken\ndown to the N = (0, 1) subalgebra described above equation (10.56). To explain how this happens we\nrecall that open strings stretched between branes give rise to fields which propagate on the D-brane\n77In fact a IIB background with non-vanishing D9-brane charge suffers from inconsistencies at the quantum level. This\nis not relevant here because the D9-branes in question are just a starting point for a classical dimensional reduction.\n170\nworld-volume. So far we have only included the adjoint representation fields which arise from strings\nstretching between pairs of D5-branes. As our configuration now includes both D5- and D9-branes there\nis the additional possibility of states corresponding to strings with one end on each of the two different\ntypes of brane. As the D5-brane and D9-brane ends of the string carry U(k) and U(N) Chan-Paton\nindices respectively, the resulting states transform in the (k,N) representation of U(k)\u00d7 U(N).\nIn fact the additional degrees-of-freedom transform as hypermultiplets of N = (0, 1) supersymmetry\nin six dimensions [155]. As these hypermultiplets cannot be combined to form multiplets of N = (1, 1)\nsupersymmetry, the residual supersymmetry of the six dimensional theory is N = (0, 1) as claimed\nabove. Each hypermultiplet contains two complex scalars wui\u03b1\u02d9, \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2. Here, as previously, i and u are\nfundamental representation indices of U(k) and U(N) respectively. The fact that hypermultiplet scalars\ntransform as doublets of the SU(2) R-symmetry is familiar from N = 2 theories in four dimensions.\nEach hypermultiplet also contains a pair of complex Weyl spinors, \u00b5Aui and \u00b5\u00af\nA\niu. The six-dimensional\naction for the hypermultiplets can be deduced from the action (10.58) of the {a\u2032n,MA} hypermultiplet:\n4\u03c02\ng2p+5\nS\n(f)\nmatter =\n4\u03c02\ng2p+5\n\u222b\nd6\u03be trk\n{\n\u2212Daw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9Daw\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 i2 \u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afADa\u00b5B \u2212 i\n(\n\u00b5\u00afAw\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5\nA\n)\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A + i ~D \u00b7 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9w\u00af\u03b2\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9\n}\n.\n(10.61)\nThe scalar and fermion kinetic terms in the above action include the fundamental representation co-\nvariant derivative, Daw = \u2202aw \u2212 iw\u03c7a, etc. The remaining two terms in (10.61) are the fundamental\nrepresentation versions of the Yukawa coupling and D-terms which appear in (10.58). The complete\naction of the six-dimensional theory is then the amalgam of (10.57), (10.58) and (10.61):\nS =\n4\u03c02\ng2p+5\n(\n4\u03c02\u03b1\u20322Sgauge + S\n(a)\nmatter + S\n(f)\nmatter\n)\n.

(10.65)\nThe reader will have noticed that we have chosen our notation so that each hypermultiplet field has\na counterpart, denoted by the same letter, in the N = 4 instanton calculus. In particular the various\nindices on these fields correspond with those on the corresponding ADHM variable. The physical reason\nfor this correspondence is simple: the six-dimensional fields are the collective coordinates of the D5-\nbranes. As the D5-branes are equivalent to Yang-Mills instantons, the vacuum moduli space of the U(k)\ngauge theory on the D5-branes should coincide with the N = 4 supersymmetric k-instanton moduli\nspace described by the ADHM construction. As the only scalar fields in the six-dimensional theory lie in\nN = (0, 1) hypermultiplets, the relevant vacuum moduli space is conventionally referred to as a Higgs\nbranch. Precisely how the proposed equivalence arises was explained in [155]. The Higgs branch is\ndescribed by the vanishing of the D-term. The D-term equation-of-motion which follows from varying\nthe action is\n\u03b1\u20322 ~D =\ni\n16\u03c02\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n(\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (10.66)\nSo the condition for a supersymmetric vacuum, ~D = 0, is equivalent to the ADHM constraints (2.65).\nSince global U(k) gauge transformations relate equivalent vacua, we see that the Higgs branch of theory\nyields precisely the ADHM construction of the instanton moduli space Mk in the form of a hyper-\nKa\u00a8hler quotient. This is a particular example of the more general fact that the Higgs branch of a\ngauge theory with 8 supercharges is a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient (for example see Refs. [147,167,168]). The\ngeneral construction involves a gauge group G and hypermultiplets transforming in some representation\nof G. The canonical kinetic terms of the hypermultiplet scalars z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 defines the metric on the mother\nspace (B.35) and the gauge group action defines the vector fields Xr in (B.37). The auxiliary fields ~D\nare the moment maps (B.39). Setting ~D = 0 and dividing by global gauge transformations gives the\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction.78\nAt a generic point on the Higgs branch, the U(k) gauge symmetry is completely broken and at low\nenergies the vector multiplet can be integrated out leading to a six-dimensional N = (0, 1) supersym-\nmetric \u03c3-model with Mk as target space. At leading order, the low-energy effective action is obtained\n78Note the \u03b6c in (B.39) are precisely Fayet-Illiopolos terms for any abelian factors of G.\n172\nby simply removing Sgauge, the kinetic terms of the vector multiplet, from the action (10.62). In this\nlimit, the vector multiplet fields {\u03c7a, ~D, \u03c8\u00afA} become auxiliary and the resulting theory is precisely the\nlinear \u03c3-model describing the moduli space dynamics of instanton branes in ten-dimensional N = 1\ngauge theory constructed in \u00a7X.2. Note in this low-energy limit, ~D and \u03c8\u00afA become the Lagrange mul-\ntipliers (10.40) for the c-number and Grassmann ADHM constraints, (2.65) and (4.34), respectively, as\n. Moreover, \u03c7a is the auxiliary U(k) gauge field in the linear action (10.39) (also, up to a re-scaling, the\nauxiliary variables that we used to bi-linearize the action in \u00a7X.2.3). At higher energies, or for small\nVEVs, where non-abelian subgroups are restored, the stringy corrections involving the kinetic terms for\nthe vector multiplet become increasingly important and the simple moduli space picture breaks down.\nStarting from the configuration of D5- and D9-branes described above, the general case of parallel Dp\nand D(p+4)-branes with p < 5 can be obtained by dimensional reduction on the brane world-volumes.\nIn this case the vacuum structure of the gauge theory describing the brane configuration is richer. The\nreason is that on dimensional reduction 5\u2212 p of the components of the gauge field \u03c7a\u02c6, a\u02c6 = p+1, . . . , 5,\nbecome adjoint scalars and can develop VEVs. These scalars describe the freedom for the Dp-branes\nto move off into the 5 \u2212 p dimensions transverse to both the Dp and D(p + 4)-branes. In addition to\nthe ADHM constraints (2.65), the classical equations for a supersymmetric vacuum now include\n[\u03c7a\u02c6, \u03c7b\u02c6] = w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a\u02c6 = [a\n\u2032\nn, \u03c7a\u02c6] = 0 . (10.67)\nThe classical vacuum moduli space consists of distinct branches. First of all, there is a Coulomb\nbranch where \u03c7a\u02c6 and a\n\u2032\nn are diagonal with w\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 and on which the gauge group is broken to U(1)\nk.\nThis corresponds to situation where the Dp-branes are located (generically) in the bulk away from\nthe D(p + 4)-branes. The diagonal elements of \u03c7a\u02c6 give the positions of the k Dp-brane transverse to\nthe D(p + 4)-branes while the diagonal elements of a\u2032n gives the positions of the Dp-branes along the\nworld-volume of the D(p+ 4)-branes. When a given element (\u03c7a)ii goes to zero, the corresponding Dp-\nbrane touches the world-volume of the D3-branes. In this case, it is clear from (10.67) that it is then\npossible for wui\u03b1\u02d9 (for the given value of i) to become non-vanishing. The Dp-brane is then \u201cabsorbed\u201d\nonto the D(p + 4)-branes. On this new branch of the vacuum moduli space the Dp-brane becomes a\ngenuine Yang-Mills instanton with a non-zero scale size \u03c12i =\n1\n2\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iuwui\u03b1\u02d9 (no sum on i). Other kinds of\n\u201cmixed\u201d branches arise when more of the k Dp-branes are absorbed into the D(p+4)-branes. The Higgs\nbranch described the situation where all the Dp-branes have been absorbed into the D(p + 4)-branes\nand so \u03c7a\u02c6 = 0. Notice that the vacuum moduli space for on the Higgs branch with p < 5 continues\nto be the instanton moduli space Mk. In the reverse sense, when an instanton shrinks down to zero\nsize, i.e. becomes an ideal instanton in the gauge theory on the world-volume of the D(p+4)-branes, it\nbecomes a Dp-brane which can move off into the bulk. These transitions move through the points where\nthe different branches of the vacuum moduli space touch. As long as p > 1, so that the world-volume\ntheory on the Dp-branes is more than two-dimensional, we expect the qualitative picture of distinct\nbranches to be valid, at least semi-classically. However, the points at which the different branches touch\ncorrespond to situations where a non-abelian subgroup of the gauge group is restored. The theory\nhere will be strongly coupled and so we expect the moduli space description to break down. These\nare regimes where we cannot ignore the kinetic terms of the vector multiplet and stringy corrections\nare expected to be important. The situations with p \u2264 1 are rather different since there can be no\nsymmetry breaking in this case. However, the picture of the low-energy dynamics being described by\n173\n\u03c3-models on the appropriate moduli spaces is still expected to be valid.\nIn particular the case of D0\/D4-branes in the Type IIA theory has been studied extensively because\nof its application as a light-cone matrix model of the N = (2, 0) theory in six dimensions [169]. In\nthis case, the D0-branes correspond to solitons in the 4 + 1 dimensional gauge theory on the D4-brane\nworld-volume. These solitons are just four-dimensional Yang-Mills instantons thought of as static finite-\nenergy configurations in five dimensions. At weak coupling, we expect the dynamics of these solitons to\nbe correctly described by supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the instanton moduli space. Hence,\nit is not surprising that precisely this quantum mechanical system is obtained in [169] by dimensionally\nreducing the six-dimensional N = (0, 1) theory described above down to a single time dimension. On\nadding another world-volume dimension, we obtain the D1\/D5 system discussed by Witten in [170].\nThe D1-branes are now strings in a six dimensional Yang-Mills theory and, in the decoupling limit,\ntheir world-sheet dynamics is described by a two-dimensional N = (4, 4) non-linear \u03c3-model with the\nADHM moduli space as the target manifold. This \u03c3-model has kinetic terms for the coordinates on\nthe target and their superpartners and as usual the supersymmetric completion of the action involves\na four-fermion term which couples to the Riemann tensor of the target. If we reduce this action back\nto one dimension by discarding spatial derivatives we obtain the quantum mechanics of [169].\nIn order to arrive at a description of D-instantons in the presence of D3-branes we must dimensionally\nreduce the world-volume theory of the D5-branes all the way to zero dimensions. However, in order\nto recover the instanton calculus, we must first perform a Wick rotation in the world-volume of the\nD5-branes. Vector quantities, including the \u03a3-matrices, in Minkowski space va = (v0, ~v), a = 0, . . . , 5,\nbecome va = (~v, iv\n0), a = 1, . . . , 6 and the Euclidean action is SEucl = \u2212iSMink. After dimensional\nreduction, the symmetry group U(k) \u00d7 U(N) \u00d7 H\u00af of the six-dimensional system now has a simple\ninterpretation: U(k) is the auxiliary symmetry of the ADHM construction, U(N) is the gauge group\nof the D3-brane theory, SU(4) is the R-symmetry group of the N = 4 supersymmetry algebra and\nSO(4) = SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R is the four-dimensional Lorentz group.\nWe will now write down the collective-coordinate integral which determines the leading semi-classical\ncontribution of k D-instantons to correlation functions of the low-energy fields of the IIB theory in\nthe presence of N D3-branes. From the above discussion, the appropriate generalization of (10.52), is\nobtained by Wick rotating and then dimensionally reducing the partition function of the six-dimensional\ntheory. The resulting matrix theory has a partition function79\nZk =\n1\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd6\u03c7 d8\u03bb d3D d4a\u2032 d8M\u2032 d2w d2w\u00af d4\u00b5 d4\u00b5\u00af e\u2212S , (10.68)\nwhere the action is deduced from (10.57), (10.58) and (10.61) reduced to zero dimensions:\nS =\n4\u03c02\ng2\n(\n4\u03c02\u03b1\u20322SG + SK + SD\n)\n, (10.69)\n79In this section, we shall not keep a careful track of the overall normalization of the partition function which, of course,\nis important for calculating physical quantities.\n174\nwhere g \u2261 g4 and\nSG = trk\n{\n1\n2\n[\u03c7a, \u03c7b]\n2 \u2212 \u03a3ABa \u03c8\u00afA[\u03c7a, \u03c8\u00afB]\u2212 12D2mn\n}\n, (10.70a)\nSK = trk\n{\n\u2212 [\u03c7a, a\u2032n]2 + \u03c7aw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a \u2212 14 \u03a3\u00afaABM\u2032\u03b1A[\u03c7a,M\u2032B\u03b1 ] + 12 \u03a3\u00afaAB\u00b5\u00afA\u00b5B\u03c7a\n}\n, (10.70b)\nSD = trk\n{\n\u2212 i ~D \u00b7 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n(\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9w\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\n\u2032\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n+ i\n(\n\u00b5\u00afAw\u03b1\u02d9 + w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5\nA + [M\u2032A, a\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9]\n)\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A\n}\n. (10.70c)\nNote that SG arises from the dimensional reduction of Sgauge and SK + SD comes from the dimensional\nreduction of S\n(a)\nmatter + S\n(f)\nmatter. Specifically, SK contains the six-dimensional gauge couplings of the\nhypermultiplets while SD contains the Yukawa couplings and D-terms.\nSemi-classical correlation functions of the light fields can be calculated by replacing each field with\nits value in the D-instanton background and performing the collective coordinate integrations with\nmeasure (10.68). In the case of the low-energy gauge fields on the D3-brane, the relevant classical\nconfiguration is simply the charge-k Yang-Mills instanton specified by the ADHM data which appears\nexplicitly in the action (10.70a)-(10.70c). Note that the collective coordinate integral (10.68) depends\nexplicitly on the string length-scale \u03b1\u2032 only via the zero dimensional remnant of the kinetic terms of\nthe vector multiplet. As a consequence correlation functions which include fields inserted at distinct\nspacetime points x(i) and x(j) will have a non-trivial expansion in powers of\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032\/|x(i) \u2212 x(j)|. In order\nto decouple the world-volume gauge theory from gravity we must take the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 keeping the\nfour-dimensional coupling g fixed. In this limit, the coupling of SK+SD is held fixed while the remnant\nof the kinetic term of the vector multiplet, SG, decouples from the action. In this limit, the collective\ncoordinate integral (10.68) becomes\nZk =\n1\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd6\u03c7d8\u03bbd3Dd4a\u2032 d8M\u2032 d4w d4\u00b5 d4\u00b5\u00af exp (\u2212SK \u2212 SD) . (10.71)\nWe can now make contact with the N = 4 instanton calculus. Note that SK can be written more\ncompactly as\nSK =\n4\u03c02\ng2\ntrk \u03c7aL\u03c7a +\n2\u03c02\ng2\n\u03a3\u00afaABtrk M\u00afAMB\u03c7a . (10.72)\nWe now recognize the partition function (10.71) as being the instanton partition function in its linearized\nform (6.90) with SK + SD being the instanton effective action S\u02dc in (6.91).\nWe have therefore recovered the leading-order semi-classical expression for the collective coordinate\nintegral for instantons in the N = 4 supersymmetric theory. In addition the action SK+SD is invariant\nunder eight supercharges which are inherited from the N = (0, 1) theory in six dimensions. One can\ncheck that after Wick rotation and dimensional reduction, the supersymmetry transformations (10.64a)\nand (10.65) (up to appropriate re-scaling by g) match the collective coordinate supersymmetries of the\nN = 4 ADHM instanton calculus written down in (4.68) and (4.70), or (6.95a)-(6.95d). There are also\neight additional fermionic symmetries, corresponding to \u03beA in (4.70), which only appear after taking\nthe decoupling limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. These correspond to the half of the superconformal transformations of the\nN = 4 theory which leave the instanton invariant.\nOne can ask how constrained instantons appear in this context. Constrained instantons arise\nwhen the N = 4 theory is on its Coulomb branch realized by separating the N D3-branes in the\n175\nsix-dimensional transverse space. This obviously changes the lengths of string stretched between the\nD-instantons and D3-branes and has the effect of adding mass terms for the fundamental hypermulti-\nplet fields. At the level of the matrix theory action (10.47) the relevant effect can be introduced by the\nreplacements (6.93). Taking the decoupling limit and integrating out the vector multiplet one recovers\nthe instanton effective action (5.25) for N = 4 constrained instantons.\nX.3.2 Probing the stringy instanton\nWe have seen in the preceding section that many of the features of the instanton calculus are reproduced\nby considering the dynamics of Dp-branes lying inside D(p+4)-branes. It is interesting to ask whether\nthe actual ADHM form for the gauge potential (2.49) can be obtained in this string theory context.\nThe answer is affirmative once an appropriate probe is identified. The concept of a probe which is able\nto \u201cfeel\u201d the instanton background was first described by Witten [158] in the context of Type I string\ntheory. The idea was generalized to the Type II theories needed for the present discussion by Douglas\nin [156]. The appropriate probe turns out to be a D-brane as well. In the context of the D5\/D9-brane\nsystem described in the last section, the probe is a single D1-brane (or D-string) whose world-volume\nlies parallel to the other branes. The D-string \u201cfeels\u201d the D5\/D9-brane background since the fields of\nthe D-string world-sheet theory include a subset that arise from open strings stretched between the\nD-string and the other higher-dimensional branes. The whole configuration is like a Russian doll: the\nD5\/D9 and D1\/D5 sub-systems are both examples of our general Dp\/D(p + 4) system described in\n\u00a7X.3.1. In the composite system, the ADHM variables appear both as fields of the D5-branes and as\ncouplings of the world-sheet theory of the D-string. The conditions for the resulting world-sheet theory\nto be N = (0, 4) supersymmetric are precisely the ADHM constraints (2.65).\nIn more detail, we now analyse the dynamics of a D-string in the background of k D5-branes and\nN D9-branes. The system breaks the ten-dimensional Lorentz group to SO(1, 1) \u00d7 SO(4)1 \u00d7 SO(4)2.\nHere, SO(4)1 describes the directions transverse to the D5-branes denoted by vector index n = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nFrom earlier, SO(4)1 \u2243 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R, where the latter correspond to the spinor indices \u03b1 and\n\u03b1\u02d9. The other factors SO(1, 1)\u00d7 SO(4)2 are a subgroup SO(5, 1), the Lorentz group of the D5-branes\u2019\nworld-volume. We will denote the corresponding spinor indices of SO(4)2 \u2243 SU(2)A\u00d7 SU(2)B by \u03b4 and\n\u03b4\u02d9, respectively. Under the decomposition SO(5, 1) \u2283 SO(1, 1)\u00d7 SO(4)2\n4\u2192 (2, 1)1 + (1, 2)\u22121 , 4\u00af\u2192 (2, 1)\u22121 + (1, 2)1 , 6\u2192 (2, 2)0 + (1, 1)2 + (1, 1)\u22122 . (10.73)\nHere, the subscripts indicate the SO(1, 1) chirality.\nLet us ignore, for the moment, the presence of the D9-branes. The D-string\/D5-brane system is an\nexample of the Dp\/D(p+ 4)-brane system studied in the last section. Recall that the D-string world-\nsheet theory can best be derived as the dimensional reduction of the D5\/D9-brane system, with one\nD5-brane and k D9-branes. Obviously, we will have to use a different notation to describe the fields\nof the D-string theory as well as re-assigning indices appropriately. The action of the theory is the\ndimensional reduction to two dimensions of (10.62) with the following replacements. Firstly, there is a\n176\nU(1) gauge field and fermions\n\u03c7a \u2192 (A\u00b1, xn) , \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A \u2192 (\u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1, \u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9) (10.74)\nwhere A\u00b1 are the light-cone components of the two-dimensional abelian gauge field. Note that xn\ndenotes, in this context, a field in the world-sheet theory rather than a spacetime coordinate. Since the\nworld-sheet theory is abelian the adjoint hypermultiplet previously denoted {a\u2032n,M\u2032A\u03b1 } decouples and\nwe can safely ignore it. Finally, the fundamental hypermultiplets describing string stretched between\nthe D-string and D5-branes are described by the replacements\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 \u2192 \u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9 , \u00b5A \u2192 (\u03b8\u03b1i , \u03b8\u03b1\u02d9i ) , w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iu \u2192 \u03c6\u00af\u03b4\u02d9i , \u00b5\u00afA \u2192 (\u03b8\u00af\u03b1i , \u03b8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9i ) . (10.75)\nThe world-sheet theory describing the D-string in the presence of the D5-branes has conventional kinetic\nterms along with a potential80\nLpot = \u2212\u03c6\u00af\u03b4\u02d9i\u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9xnxn +\n3\u2211\nc=1\n(\n\u03c4 c\u03b4\u02d9 \u01eb\u02d9 \u03c6\u00af\n\u01eb\u02d9\ni \u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9\n)2\n. (10.76)\nHere, the second term comes from the D-terms which can be viewed as the ADHM constraint for the\nD-string viewed as a single instanton inside the U(k) gauge theory on the D5-branes. There are also\nYukawa couplings\nLYuk = \u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\ni x\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni + \u03b8\u00afi\u03b1\u02d9x\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u03b8i\u03b1 +\n(\n\u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1\u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\ni + \u03b6\u00af\n\u03b4\u02d9\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni\n)\n\u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9 +\n(\n\u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1\u03b8\n\u03b1\ni + \u03b6\u00af\n\u03b4\u02d9\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni\n)\n\u03c6\u00afi\u03b4\u02d9 . (10.77)\nThe first two terms are the fermionic ADHM constraints for the Grassmann collective coordinates of\nthe single U(k) instanton.\nAt the moment we have assumed all the D5-branes are coincident. In reality the D5-branes will be\nseparated (in addition to being \u201cthickened out\u201d) in a way described by the ADHM matrices a\u2032n. By\ntranslational symmetry, the effect can be introduced into the world-sheet theory by replacing xn by the\nmatrix quantity\nxn \u2212\u2192 xn1[k]\u00d7[k] + a\u2032n . (10.78)\nIn this way the ADHM variables a\u2032n appear as couplings in the world-sheet theory.\nNow we must consider the effect of the D9-branes. First of all, there are new fields in the world-sheet\ntheory describing open strings stretched between the D-string and the D9-branes. Since there are no\nadditional moduli and the new fields are fermionic, \u01ebu and \u01eb\u00afu. The second effect of the D9-branes is\nthat in the configuration we are interested in, they absorb the D5-branes and the latter thicken out in\na way parameterized by the ADHM variables w\u03b1\u02d9. These variables will, like a\n\u2032\nn, appear as couplings in\nthe world-sheet theory. Taking into account the D9-branes leads to a modified potential which has a\nvery suggestive form:\nLpot = \u2212\u03c6\u00af\u03b4\u02d9i \u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03bbi \u2206\u03bbj\u03b1\u02d9\u03c6j\u03b4\u02d9 +\n3\u2211\nc=1\n(\n\u03c4 c\u03b4\u02d9 \u01eb\u02d9 \u03c6\u00af\n\u01eb\u02d9\ni \u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9\n)2\n. (10.79)\n80In the following expressions we do not keep careful track of the coupling constants and normalizations.\n177\nHere, \u2206 and \u2206\u00af are the ADHM quantities introduced in \u00a7II.4 (with the canonical choice (2.57)) but\nwhere now xn is viewed as a field rather than as a spacetime coordinate. Note (10.79) subsumes (10.76).\nThe Yukawa coupling have a similarly suggestive form:\nLYuk = \u03a5\u00af\n\u03bb\u2206\u03bbi\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni + \u03b8\u00afi\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\ni \u03a5\u03bb +\n(\n\u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1\u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\ni + \u03b6\u00af\n\u03b4\u02d9\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni\n)\n\u03c6i\u03b4\u02d9 +\n(\n\u03b6\u00af \u03b4\u02d9\u03b1\u03b8\n\u03b1\ni + \u03b6\u00af\n\u03b4\u02d9\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b8\n\u03b1\u02d9\ni\n)\n\u03c6\u00afi\u03b4\u02d9 , (10.80)\nwhere we have defined the composites81\n\u03a5\u03bb =\n(\n\u01ebu\n\u03b8i\u03b1\n)\n, \u03a5\u00af\u03bb =\n(\n\u01eb\u00afu \u03b8\u00af\n\u03b1\ni\n)\n. (10.81)\nNote (10.80) subsumes (10.77).\nAs is often the case, the conditions that the world-sheet theory is N = (0, 4) invariant is identical\nto the equations-of-motion in the target space: in this case the D-flatness conditions in the D5-brane\ntheory. In other words, as argued in [158], the conditions for extended N = (0, 4) supersymmetry are\nthe ADHM constraints (2.65) on {w\u03b1\u02d9, a\u2032n} viewed as coupling in the world-sheet theory.\nFor generic ADHM data, the potential (10.79) gives a mass to the fields \u03c6. These fields can then\nbe integrated out leading to a (gauged) \u03c3-model. At the classical level, we can simply set \u03c6 = 0. The\nfields xn are massless and the resulting \u03c3-model involves the flat metric on R\n4. The fermionic sector is\nmore interesting. The first two Yukawa couplings in (10.80) give masses to \u03b8\u03b1\u02d9i , \u03b8\u00afi\u03b1\u02d9 and a 2k-dimensional\nsubspace of both \u03a5\u03bb and \u03a5\u00af\n\u03bb. What we are interested in are the remaining massless fermionic degrees-of-\nfreedom. To order to identify these modes we need bases for the null spaces of \u2206 and \u2206\u00af. But these are\nprovided by the ADHM quantities U\u00af and U , respectively, as is apparent in (2.47). Hence, the massless\nmodes {\u03c1u, \u03c1\u00afu} are picked out by\n\u03a5\u03bb = U\u03bbu\u03c1u , \u03a5\u00af\n\u03bb = \u03c1\u00afuU\u00af\n\u03bb\nu . (10.82)\nThe kinetic term for the massless modes then follows by substitution into the kinetic term for \u03a5:\n\u03a5\u00af\u03bb\u2202\u2212\u03a5\u03bb \u2212\u2192 \u03c1\u00afu\n(\n\u03b4uv\u2202\u2212 + (\u2202\u2212xn)(An)uv\n)\n\u03c1v , (10.83)\nwith\n(An)uv(x) = U\u00af\n\u03bb\nu\n\u2202U\u03bbv\n\u2202xn\n. (10.84)\nThis is precisely the ADHM expression for the gauge potential (2.49) as a function of the field xn (with\ng \u2192 1). Of course the expression that we have derived for the gauge potential is only valid in the\nclassical limit and there will be stringy corrections to the instanton profile on a scale set by\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032.\nX.3.3 The N = 2 instanton calculus\nThere are a number of ways to obtain four-dimensional N = 2 theories as the collective dynamics of\nbranes in string theory. The first observation is that the N = 2 theory has 8 supercharges and may be\n81Recall, from \u00a7II.4, \u03bb is the ADHM composite index u+ i\u03b1.\n178\nobtained from the dimensional reduction of a six-dimensional theory with N = (0, 1) supersymmetry.\nJust as in the case of the N = 4 theory it is useful to realize the N = 2 theory in its maximal dimension.\nIn this case, an instanton will be a 1-brane soliton as described in \u00a7X.2.\nOne way to realize the six-dimensional theory is to consider the collective dynamics of D5-branes\nembedded in a spacetime where the four transverse dimensions are orbifold R4\/Z2. The collective dy-\nnamics of the D5-branes can be deduced in the following way [171\u2013173]. First of all, suppose we start\nwith a set of N\u02dc parallel D5-branes in flat ten-dimensional Minkowski space. From the discussion in\n\u00a7X.3.1, the world-volume theory is simply the dimensional reduction to six of N = 1 supersymmetric\nU(N\u02dc) gauge theory in ten dimensions. This theory has 16 supercharges, i.e. has N = (1, 1) supersym-\nmetry in six dimensions. The theory has an SU(2)A\u00d7SU(2)B R-symmetry which occurs because of the\nSO(4) rotational symmetry of the transverse space. Now we replace the transverse space with the orb-\nifold R4\/Z2, where the Z2 is chosen to act as the centre of SU(2)A. The resulting world-volume theory\nof the D5-branes is deduced by a process of projection in the following way. Notice that the \u03c3R = Z2\nacts on the fields via their R-symmetry indices. The next part of the procedure involves embedding\nthe Z2 group action as \u03c3U(N\u02dc) in the gauge group. There are different ways to do this. However, up to\nconjugation we can take\n\u03c3U(N\u02dc) =\n(\n1[N]\u00d7[N] 0\n0 \u22121[M]\u00d7[M]\n)\n, (10.85)\nwith N\u02dc = N + M . The resulting theory is then obtained by taking the fields and action of the\noriginal N = (1, 1) theory and projecting out by hand all the fields which are not invariant under\nthe simultaneous transformation by \u03c3R\u03c3U(N). The resulting theory has gauge group U(N) \u00d7 U(M),\nthe supersymmetry is reduced to N = (0, 1) and there are two hypermultiplets in the bi-fundamental\nrepresentation of the gauge group, i.e. each having fields in the (N ,M\u00af) + (N\u00af ,M).\nNow we consider instantons. In the six-dimensional theory the instantons correspond to D1-branes\nlying inside the D5-brane, the same situation as in \u00a7X.3.1, but now lying transverse to the orbifold\nrather than R4. The collective dynamics of the D1-branes in this configuration can be deduced from\nthe Dp\/D(p+ 4)-brane system discussed in \u00a7X.3.1 (with N\u02dc D(p + 4)-branes) and then performing the\nsame kind of projection on the D1-brane world-sheet theory that we did for the D5-brane world-volume\ntheory above. Firstly, one embeds Z2 both in the R-symmetry group and in the gauge group, but now\nthe gauge group is pertains to the D1-branes. Firstly the R-symmetry. In terms of the variables of the\ninstanton calculus, the Z2 is embedded as \u03c3R in the group SO(6) \u2243 SU(4) that arose from the world-\nvolume Lorentz symmetry of the D5-branes in the D5\/D9-brane system. On dimensional reduction to\nthe D1\/D5-brane system SO(6) is broken to SO(1, 1)\u00d7 SU(2)A \u00d7 SU(2)B and \u03c3R acts as the centre of\nSU(2)A. For instance, \u03c7a which transforms in the vector of SO(6), breaks up into\n\u03c3R(\u03c7a) =\n{\n\u03c7a a = 0, 1\n\u2212\u03c7a a = 2, 3, 4, 5 .\n(10.86)\nHere, the invariant components are the two-dimensional U(k) gauge field on the D1-brane world-sheet.\nFor spinor quantities like \u03c8\u00afA and M\u2032A, we have\n\u03c3R(\u03c8\u00afA) =\n{\n\u03c8\u00afA A = 1, 2\n\u2212\u03c8\u00afA A = 3, 4 ,\n\u03c3R(M\u2032A) =\n{\nM\u2032A A = 1, 2\n\u2212M\u2032A A = 3, 4 (10.87)\n179\nand similarly for \u00b5A and \u00b5\u00afA. The embedding Z2 in the U(k) gauge group of the D1-brane world-volume\ntheory determines the instanton charge of the configuration. For instance\n\u03c3U(k) =\n(\n1[k1]\u00d7[k1] 0\n0 \u22121[k2]\u00d7[k2]\n)\n, (10.88)\nwith k = k1 + k2 describes an instanton configuration with charges k1 and k2 with respect to the U(N)\nand U(M) factors of the gauge group. In order to have an instanton which lives solely in the U(N)\nfactor we must set k2 = 0 so that k1 \u2261 k and in this case \u03c3U(k) = 1[k]\u00d7[k]. From the point-of-view of this\ninstanton configuration the U(M) gauge group plays the ro\u02c6le of a spectator since, to leading order, the\nU(M)-adjoint fields are zero and the U(M) symmetry is effectively a global symmetry. Consequently on\ndimensional reduction of the D5-branes to four dimensions, the resulting theory is effectively an N = 2\ntheory with NF = 2M fundamental hypermultiplets.\n82\nThe world-volume theory on the D1-branes is then obtained from the action of the D5-branes in\nthe D5\/D9-brane system, that is (10.56), dimensionally reduced to two dimensions and by removing by\nhand any fields that are not invariant under a simultaneous transformation \u03c3R\u03c3U(k)\u03c3U(N\u02dc). The latter\ntransformation has to be included because the fundamental hypermultiplets carry U(N\u02dc) gauge indices.\nIn our case, recall that \u03c3U(k) = 1[k]\u00d7[k]. The fields that remain are the following. Firstly, from (10.86),\nonly the components \u03c7a, a = 0, 1 remain. This is a U(k) gauge field in two dimensions. For the other\nadjoint-valued fields, the bosonic quantities a\u2032n survive, since these are invariant under \u03c3R. For the\nfermions only the components \u03c8\u00afA andM\u2032A, with A = 1, 2 remain. The situation is slightly more subtle\nfor the fundamental hypermultiplets. Each index u\u02dc can now run over N +M values which split into\ntwo set: u = 1, . . . , N and u\u2032 = 1, . . . ,M . Then, for example,\n\u03c3U(N\u02dc)(wui\u03b1\u02d9) = wui\u03b1\u02d9 , \u03c3U(N\u02dc)(wu\u2032i\u03b1\u02d9) = \u2212wu\u2032i\u03b1\u02d9 (10.89)\nand similarly for the other hypermultiplet fields. Therefore, the fields wui\u03b1\u02d9 survive along with \u00b5\nA\nui and\n\u00b5\u00afAiu, for A = 1, 2. However, in addition the fermionic fields \u00b5\nA\nu\u2032i and \u00b5\nA\niu\u2032 , with A = 3, 4, are odd with\nrespect to both \u03c3R and \u03c3U(N\u02dc) and so survive.\nWe now show that on dimensional reduction to zero dimensions and in the decoupling limit, the\npartition function of the resulting matrix theory is the leading order expression for the collective coor-\ndinate integral of the N = 2 theory with NF = 2M hypermultiplets. The details are almost identical\nto the N = 4 case described in \u00a7X.3.1. In particular, as previously, in the decoupling limit, the ~D\nand \u03c8\u00afA (A = 1, 2) become Lagrange multipliers for the bosonic and fermionic ADHM constraints. The\nmain difference is that the the dimensionally reduced (Wick rotated) action (10.72) is subject to the\nprojection described above yielding83\nSK =\n4\u03c02\ng2\n{\ntrk \u03c7aL\u03c7a\u2212 12(\u03c71\u2212 i\u03c72)\n(M\u00af1uM2u\u2212M\u00af2uM1u)\u2212 12(\u03c71+ i\u03c72)(M\u00af3u\u2032M4u\u2032\u2212M\u00af4u\u2032M3u\u2032)} . (10.90)\nIn this expression a sum over a = 1, 2 is implied. The integral over \u03c7a yields the factor of |detk2L|\u22121 in\n(5.55) for N = 2. While the action becomes\nS\u02dc = \u2212\u03c0\n2\ng2\ntrk\n(M\u00af1uM2u \u2212 M\u00af2uM2u)L\u22121(M\u00af3u\u2032M4u\u2032 \u2212 M\u00af4u\u2032M3u\u2032) . (10.91)\n82Note only NF even theories can be obtained in this way.\n83It is useful to recall that in Euclidean space \u03a3\u00af1 = \u03b7\n3 and \u03a3\u00af2 = i\u03b7\u00af\n3.\n180\nThis is precisely equal to (6.84) after a suitable re-scaling by g, with the VEVs set to zero and with the\nrelations\nKf = (M\u00af3u\u2032,M\u00af4u\u2032) , K\u02dcf = i(M3u\u2032,\u2212M4u\u2032) , (10.92)\nwhere f = 1, . . . , NF = 2M . Just as in the N = 4 case, the instanton effective action on the Coulomb\nbranch of the N = 2 theory can easily be obtained by separating the D5-branes in the two dimensions\ntransverse to their world-volume orthogonal to the orbifold.\nX.3.4 Mass couplings and soft supersymmetry breaking\nIn \u00a7VI.3, we described how the instanton calculus was modified when mass terms were added to the\nfield theory breaking supersymmetry successively from N = 4, through N = 2 and N = 1 to N =\n0. Using the response of the instanton to field theory masses, we were able to relate in \u00a7V.4 the\ncollective coordinate integrals with different numbers of supersymmetries by a process of decoupling\nand renormalization group matching. In this section, we describe how the effects of mass terms may be\nrealized in the brane description.\nFirst of all, let us establish at the level of the N = 4 field theory, the form of the mass deformation.\nIt is useful at this stage to introduce the language of N = 1 superfields. The N = 4 theory consists of\nan N = 1 vector multiplet along with three adjoint-valued chiral multiplets \u03a6i = {\u03d5i\/\n\u221a\n2, \u03bbi}, i = 1, 2, 3.\nThe relation between these fields and the fields that we introduced in \u00a7IV.1 can be chosen as\n\u03d51 = i\u03c65 + \u03c66 , \u03d52 = i\u03c63 + \u03c64 , \u03d53 = i\u03c61 + \u03c62 (10.93)\nand\n\u03bbi = \u03bb\nA , \u03bb\u00afi = \u03bb\u00afA A = i = 1, 2, 3 . (10.94)\nWith this choice the vector multiplet contains {Am, \u03bb \u2261 \u03bb4}.\nIn terms of N = 1 superfields the action of the N = 4 theory (in Minkowski space) can be written\nS =\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\ng2\n8\u03c0\nIm \u03c4W \u03b1W\u03b1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b82\n+ 2\u03a6\u2020i e\nV\u03a6i\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b82\u03b8\u00af2\n+ 2\n3\n\u01ebijk\u03a6i\u03a6j\u03a6k\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b82\n+ 2\n3\n\u01ebijk\u03a6\n\u2020\ni\u03a6\n\u2020\nj\u03a6\n\u2020\nk\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b8\u00af2\n}\n.

(10.96)\nIn terms of component fields (in Euclidean space)\nSmass =\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\nmi\u01ebijk\u03d5i\u03d5\n\u2020\nj\u03d5\n\u2020\nk \u2212m\u2217i \u01ebijk\u03d5\u2020i\u03d5j\u03d5k + |mi|2|\u03d5i|2 +mi\u03bbi\u03bbi +m\u2217i \u03bb\u00afi\u03bb\u00afi\n}\n. (10.97)\nIt is interesting to establish the SO(6) R-symmetry properties of the mass terms above. In general a\nmass term for the fermions can be written\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\nmAB\u03bb\nA\u03bbB +mAB\u03bb\u00afA\u03bb\u00afB\n}\n(10.98)\n181\nwhere the symmetric matrix mAB (m\nAB \u2261 m\u2217AB) transforms in the 1\u00af0 (10) of SO(6). The mass matrix\ncan be chosen to be diagonal: mAB = diag(m1, m2, m3, m4). In order to preserve at least N = 1\nsupersymmetry, at least one of the mass eigenvalues must vanish. Choosing m4 = 0 gives the fermion\nmass terms in (10.97). The mass matrix can also be written as a anti-symmetric rank-3 tensor Tabc of\nSO(6). The relation between the two bases is provided by the \u03a3-matrices:\nTabc \u223c mAB\n(\n\u03a3[a\u03a3\u00afb\u03a3c]\n)AB\n+mAB\n(\n\u03a3\u00af[a\u03a3b\u03a3\u00afc]\n)\nAB\n. (10.99)\nWith some choice of normalization, the tensor T is associated to the following cubic coupling of the\nscalar fields:\nTabctrN \u03c6a\u03c6b\u03c6c = \u01ebijktrN\n{\nmi\u03d5i\u03d5\n\u2020\nj\u03d5\n\u2020\nk \u2212m\u2217i \u03d5\u2020i\u03d5j\u03d5k +m4\u03d5i\u03d5j\u03d5k \u2212m\u22174\u03d5\u2020i\u03d5\u2020j\u03d5\u2020k\n}\n. (10.100)\nWhenm4 = 0, this is precisely the bosonic part linear in the masses of the N = 1 preserving deformation\nin (10.97).\nThe question before us is how to introduce the mass deformation when the N = 4 theory is realized\nas the the collective dynamics of N coincident D3-branes in Type IIB string theory? A Dp-brane\ncarries charge which couples directly to the Ramond-Ramond p + 1-form potential C(p+1). However,\nDp-branes also couple to other background fields in the string theory. The most general couplings of\nthe Ramond-Ramond potentials to a collection of Dp-branes occurs through the Chern-Simons action\nwhose form, in the case of multiple branes, was established by Myers [174]. In particular, D3-branes\ncan carry D5-brane dipole moment which is induced by a coupling to the C(6) potential of the form84\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\n\u03c6a\u03c6bC\n(6)\n0123ab(\u03c6)\n}\n. (10.101)\nConsider the case where the associated 7-form field strength F (7) = dC(6) is constant. Then the coupling\nabove is simply equal to\n1\n3g2\n\u222b\nd4xF\n(7)\n0123abctrN \u03c6a\u03c6b\u03c6c =\n1\n3g2\n\u222b\nd4x\n( \u22176 F (3))abctrN \u03c6a\u03c6b\u03c6c , (10.102)\nusing F (7) = \u2217F (3). Here, \u22176 is Hodge duality in the six-dimensional transverse space. Comparison with\nthe mass deformation (10.97) shows that the background Ramond-Ramond field produces the bosonic\nterms linear in the masses if ( \u22176 F (3))abc = 6Tabc (10.103)\nand T is the tensor defined in (10.99).\nIn this way we have reproduced the bosonic mass coupling (10.97) using a suitable background\nRamond-Ramond potential. However, as one would expect due to supersymmetry, the background field\nalso couples to the fermions. The analogous example of D0-branes coupling to C(3) has been investigated\nin [175]. By using T-duality we can extract the analogous coupling for D3-branes. The result is most\neasily written by recalling that the fermionic fields on D3-branes can be obtained by a dimensional\nreduction of a ten-dimensional Majorana-Weyl spinor. Using the representation of the Clifford algebra\n84In the following 0123 refers to the world-volume directions.\n182\nas in (10.11) and the decomposition of \u03a8 in terms of {\u03bbA, \u03bb\u00afA} in (10.13), the coupling to the background\nC(6) potential can be written in the form\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4xF\n(7)\n0123abctrN \u03a8\u00af\u0393a\u0393b\u0393c\u03a8 . (10.104)\nUsing (10.99) and (10.103) this can be written as\n1\ng2\n\u222b\nd4x trN\n{\nmAB\u03bb\nA\u03bbB +mAB\u03bb\u00afA\u03bb\u00afB\n}\n, (10.105)\nprecisely the fermion mass coupling in (10.97).\nNow that we have established how to introduce the mass coupling in the world-volume theory of the\nD3-branes, we can now consider the effect of the same background field in the D-instanton theory. Recall\nthat the relevant effect for the D3-branes could be described as a D5-brane dipole moment coupling\nto C(6). But non-trivial C(6) also implies a non-trivial C(2) background since dC(2) = \u2217dC(6). A D-\ninstanton will carry D1-dipole moment and so a coupling to the C(2) background field. The couplings\ncan be deduced from the D3-C(6) coupling established above by successive T-dualities reducing the\nD3-branes to D-instantons. The leads to the following couplings in the D-instanton action:\n1\n3g20\nF\n(3)\nabctrk \u03c7a\u03c7b\u03c7c +\n1\ng20\nF\n(3)\nabctrk \u03a8\u00af\u0393a\u0393b\u0393c\u03a8 , (10.106)\nwhere \u03a8 is the 16-component fermion defined in (10.55) and \u0393a are components of the ten-dimensional\n\u0393-matrices (10.11) in the six-dimensional space transverse to the D3-branes. The field strength can be\ndeduced by taking the dual of (10.103):\nF (3) = 6T\u02dc , (10.107)\nwhere T\u02dc is equal to the form of T with mAB replaced by \u2212mAB . The couplings (10.106) are then simply\n\u03c02\ng2\ntrk\n{\n\u2212mABM\u2032AM\u2032B + (4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032)2\n(\n2T\u02dcabc\u03c7a\u03c7b\u03c7c +m\nAB\u03c8\u00afA\u03c8\u00afB\n)}\n. (10.108)\nNotice that the couplings involving the vector multiplet {\u03c7a, \u03c8\u00afA} do not survive in the decoupling limit\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 (fixed g). In this limit, the only surviving term is the mass coupling forM\u2032A which is identical\nto that in (6.89) (after the re-scaling MA \u2192 g1\/2MA). In order to completely reproduce (6.89), the\nhypermultiplet fermions {\u00b5A, \u00b5\u00afA}, arising from open string stretched between the D-instantons and D3-\nbranes must also couple to C(2) in an analogous way dictated by their SO(6) transformation properties.\n183\nXI Further Directions\nWhat we have said in the preceding Chapters is far from the end of the story of the calculus of many\ninstantons. There are two main developments that we turn to in this final Chapter. The first involves\nthe fate of instantons in a rather esoteric generalization of the underlying gauge theory, or rather on\nthe spacetime on which it is defined. The idea is to define the theory on a non-commutative version of\nR4. This non-commutative space is characterized by the fact that the spacetime position coordinates\nxm no longer commute. The motivation for consider such a generalization comes from string theory.\nWe have already described how gauge theories can arise as the collective dynamics of D-branes in string\ntheory and turning on certain background fields can make the resulting world-volume non-commutative.\nWhat is remarkable is that the non-commutativity of spacetime does little violence to instantons. In\nparticular the moduli space is still a commutative space. In fact it is a very simple deformation of Mk\nobtained by taking non-zero central terms for the U(1) \u2282 U(k) factor in the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient\nconstruction. In particular the deformed space, which we denote M\n(\u03b6)\nk is still hyper-Ka\u00a8hler and rather\nremarkably it is a smooth resolution of the original space: instantons can no longer shrink down to zero\nsize due to the non-commutativity. In addition, instantons now become non-trivial in theories with an\nabelian gauge group like QED.\nThe second development we describe in \u00a7XI.2 is a new way to calculate instanton effects beyond\na single instanton, or two for SU(2), when scalar fields have VEVs. As we have seen, one must use\nthe constrained instanton formalism of Affleck. To leading order in the semi-classical approximation,\nwe have seen that the effect of the VEVs is to turn on a non-trivial instanton effective action which\nacts as a potential on the instanton moduli space. We will show in the context of the calculation of\nthe prepotential in N = 2 theories that the resulting integrals over the instanton moduli space have\nthe remarkable property that they localize around the critical points of the instanton effective action.\nThis is guaranteed by the existence of a nilpotent fermionic symmetry, or BRST operator [176]. In fact\nthe critical points correspond to configurations where all the instantons shrink down to zero size. The\nsingular nature of this configuration may be regularized by making the spacetime non-commutative\nsince this removes the singularities of the instanton moduli space. Using this technology we will be\nable to rather swiftly, following [95], re-derive the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential in\nSU(N) that we calculated in \u00a7VIII.4 and then extend the method to two instantons. Very recently this\ntechnique of localization has for the first time enabled a calculation of instanton effects to all orders\nin the instanton charge for finite N [96]. The relevant theory is the N = 4 theory softly broken to\nN = 2 by giving mass m to two of the three adjoint-valued chiral multiplets and the physical quantity\nthat can be calculated to all orders in the instanton expansion are the O(m4) terms in the prepotential.\nClearly the new technique of localization looks very promising and we refer the reader to [95, 96] for\nmore details.\n184\nXI.1 Non-commutative gauge theories and instantons\nIt is not at all obvious but the rather bizarre generalization of gauge theories defined on a non-\ncommutative background spacetime has a rather pleasant and simple effect on instantons. Non-\ncommutativity is also of special interest in the framework of string theory and D-branes [177\u2013180]\n(see Ref. [181] for a review). Here we will briefly examine non-commutativity from the instanton per-\nspective.\nWe have already seen in \u00a7II.6 that the moduli space Mk of instantons in ordinary commutative gauge\ntheories fails to be a smooth manifold due to conical singularities arising when the auxiliary symmetry\ngroup U(k) does not act freely. Physically these are points where individual instantons shrink to zero\nsize, i.e. wiu\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 for a given i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. There is a natural way to resolve, or blow up, the\nsingularities of Mk \u2192 M(\u03b6)k preserving the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler structure described by Nakajima [182, 183].\nThe important observation is that the quotient group U(k) has an abelian factor and, as we explain\nin Appendix B, one has the freedom to add to each of the three moment maps a constant term in\nthe Lie algebra of any abelian factor. In the context of the ADHM construction this freedom involves\nmodifying the ADHM constraints (2.59a) by adding a term proportional to the identity k \u00d7 k matrix\nto the right-hand side as in (2.70):\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 = ~\u03b6(+)1[k]\u00d7[k] . (11.1)\nNow consider the clustering limit in which the ith instanton is well separated from the remaining. In\nthis limit, the effective ADHM constraints of the single instanton are modified from (2.102) to\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9iuwui\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03c1\n2\ni \u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9 +\n1\n2\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 \u00b7 \u03b6(+) , (11.2)\nwhere we recall that \u03c1i is a measure of the size of the instanton. Without-loss-of-generality, suppose\n~\u03b6(+) \u221d= (0, 0, 1), then it is easy to see that\n\u03c12i \u2265 12 |~\u03b6(+)| . (11.3)\nTherefore in the presence of the central term, an instanton can no longer shrink to zero size and the\nsingularity in the instanton moduli space corresponding to that process is smoothed out. For instance,\nthe U(1) \u2282 U(k) corresponding to phase rotation of wui\u03b1\u02d9 for fixed i, no longer a fixed point. In fact,\none can show that the whole of the auxiliary group U(k) no longer has any fixed points on M\n(\u03b6)\nk .\nThe question is what physical effect can introduce the central term in the ADHM constraints.\nRemarkably, we will see that precisely this smoothed instanton moduli space M\n(\u03b6)\nk , defined by (11.1),\narises in the ADHM construction of instantons in gauge theories formulated on a spacetime with non-\ncommuting coordinates [184]:\n[xm, xn] = i\u03b8mn . (11.4)\nThe 3-vector ~\u03b6(+) is precisely the anti-self-dual projection of the non-commutativity parameter \u03b8mn. We\nalso define the self-dual projection which appears in the ADHM constraints of anti-instantons:\n\u03b6c\n(+)\n\u2261 \u03b7\u00afcmn\u03b8mn , \u03b6c(\u2212) \u2261 \u03b7cmn\u03b8mn , c = 1, 2, 3 . (11.5)\nwhere \u03b7cmn and \u03b7\u00af\nc\nmn are \u2019t Hooft \u03b7-symbols (see Appendix A).\n185\nIt is quite remarkable that non-commutative instantons are non-trivial even for an abelian U(1)\ngauge group. In this case, the deformed instanton moduli space M\n(\u03b6)\nk is simply a resolution of the\nspace Symk R4.85 In fact, the case of an abelian gauge group, considered by Nekrasov and Schwarz in\nRef. [184], provided the first examples of explicit non-commutative instanton configurations. Various\naspects of the ADHM construction on non-commutative spaces were further developed and clarified in\nRefs. [185\u2013191]. Explicit examples of instanton solutions in U(N) gauge theories with space-space as\nwell as space-time non-commutativity were constructed and analysed in [190]. In general, for |~\u03b6| > 0, the\nmoduli spaces of these solutions contain no singularities. However, for semi-classical functional integral\napplications it is important to ensure that the instanton gauge field itself is also non-singular\u2014or to be\nmore precise is gauge equivalent to a non-singular configuration\u2014for all values of the argument [190].\nThe supersymmetric collective-coordinate measure for non-commutative instantons was constructed\nand the one-instanton partition function calculated in Ref. [176]. Based on these results, instanton\ncontributions to the prepotential of the non-commutative N = 2 pure gauge theory were determined\nin [192] and found to be equivalent to the corresponding commutative contributions confirming the\nhypothesis that the non-commutative version of the theory is described by the same Seiberg-Witten\ncurve [192, 193].\nXI.1.1 ADHM construction on non-commutative R4\nWe will work in flat Euclidean spacetime R4 with non-commutative coordinates xm which satisfy the\ncommutation relations (11.4) where \u03b8mn is an antisymmetric real constant matrix. Using Euclidean\nspacetime rotations, \u03b8mn can be always brought to the form\n\u03b8mn =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 \u03b812 0 0\n\u2212\u03b812 0 0 0\n0 0 0 \u03b834\n0 0 \u2212\u03b834 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (11.6)\nIn terms of complex coordinates\nz1 = x2 + ix1 , z\u00af1 = x2 \u2212 ix1 ,\nz2 = x4 + ix3 , z\u00af2 = x4 \u2212 ix3 ,\n(11.7)\nthe commutation relations (11.4) take the form\n[z1, z\u00af1] = \u22122\u03b812 , [zi, zj ] = 0 ,\n[z2, z\u00af2] = \u22122\u03b834 , [zi, z\u00afj 6=i] = 0 ,\n(11.8)\nwhere i, j = 1, 2. Besides the usual commutative case, there are two important cases to consider:\n1. When either \u03b812 or \u03b834 vanishes, the matrix \u03b8mn is of rank-two. This case corresponds to the direct\nproduct of the ordinary commutative 2-dimensional space with the non-commutative 2-dimensional\n85This is the k-fold symmetric product of R4 which arises from solving the ADHM constraints (2.65) for N = 1. The\nsolution is wi\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 and a\n\u2032\nn = \u2212diag(X1n, . . . , Xkn), X i \u2208 R4, which fixes all the U(k) symmetry apart from permutations\nof the positions X in. Modding out by the permutations gives the k-fold symmetric product of R\n4. This space is singular\nwhenever two, or more, of the point-like instantons come together, since then the group of permutations does not act\nfreely.\n186\nspace, R2NC \u00d7R2. For definiteness we set here \u03b834 = 0 and introduce the notation \u03b812 \u2261 \u2212\u03b6\/2 in such a\nway that\n[z1, z\u00af1] = \u2212\u03b6 , [z2, z\u00af2] = 0 , [zi, zj ] = 0 . (11.9)\nPhysical applications of this situation involve gauge theories defined on a background with non-commutative\nspace but commutative time.\n2. A rank-four matrix \u03b8mn (with \u03b812 6= 0 and \u03b834 6= 0) generates the non-commutative Euclidean\nspacetime R4NC = R\n2\nNC \u00d7 R2NC. The corresponding world-volume gauge theory has non-commutative\n(Euclidean) time. Since both components of \u03b8 are non-vanishing, they can be made equal, \u03b812 = \u03b834 \u2261\n\u2212\u03b6\/4, with appropriate re-scalings of the four coordinates xm and, if necessary, a parity transformation.\nEquations (11.8) become\n[zi, z\u00afj] = \u2212\u03b6\n2\n\u03b4ij , [zi, zj ] = 0 . (11.10)\nIn fact, the conditions \u03b812 = \u00b1\u03b834 corresponds to (anti-)self-duality: 12\u01ebmnkl\u03b8kl = \u00b1\u03b8mn.\nA Hilbert space representation for the non-commutative geometry (11.9) or (11.10) can be easily\nconstructed by using complex variables (11.7) and realizing z and z\u00af as creation and annihilation oper-\nators in the Fock space for simple harmonic oscillators (SHO). The fields in a non-commutative gauge\ntheory are described by functions of z1, z\u00af1, z2, z\u00af2. In the case of R\n2\nNC \u00d7R2, the arguments z2 and z\u00af2 are\nordinary c-number coordinates, while z1 and z\u00af1 are the creation and annihilation operators of a single\nSHO:\nz1 |n\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n\u221a\nn+ 1 |n\u3009 , z\u00af1 |n\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n\u221a\nn |n\u2212 1\u3009 . (11.11)\nThe non-commutative spacetime R4NC = R\n2\nNC\u00d7R2NC requires two oscillators. The SHO Fock space H is\nspanned by the basis |n1, n2\u3009 with n1, n2 \u2265 0:\nz1 |n1, n2\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n2\n\u221a\nn1 + 1 |n1 + 1, n2\u3009 , z2 |n1, n2\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n2\n\u221a\nn2 + 1 |n1, n2 + 1\u3009 ,\nz\u00af1 |n1, n2\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n2\n\u221a\nn1 |n1 \u2212 1, n2\u3009 , z\u00af2 |n1, n2\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6\n2\n\u221a\nn2 |n1, n2 \u2212 1\u3009 .\n(11.12)\nThe integral on R4NC is defined by the operator trace,\u222b\nd4x \u2217 = (2\u03c0)2\n\u221a\ndet \u03b8 Tr \u2217 =\n(\u03b6\u03c0\n2\n)2\nTr \u2217 . (11.13)\nThe ADHM construction of the instanton now proceeds exactly as in Section \u00a7II.4 but one has to\nkeep an eye on the ordering of operators. We assume the canonical form (2.57), (2.58) for the ADHM\nmatrices and analyse the requirements imposed by the factorization condition (2.50). They amount to\nthe modified ADHM constraints (cf . (2.65))\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 = ~\u03b6(+)1[k]\u00d7[k] . (11.14)\nThe three conditions (11.14) are the modified ADHM constraints for the instanton. When ~\u03b6(+) = 0\nEqs. (11.14) give the standard commutative ADHM constraints (2.59a). When non-commutativity is\npresent, the constraints are modified by the anti-self-dual component of \u03b8. Thus, the ADHM constraints\n187\nfor the instanton in a self-dual-\u03b8 background on R4NC are equal to those of commutative R\n4. However,\nthe constraints for the instanton in non-commutative space R2NC\u00d7R2 are always modified since \u03b8 cannot\nbe self-dual. The constraints are\n\u03c4 c \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 = \u03b4\nc3\u03b61[k]\u00d7[k] . (11.15)\nThe constraints for an anti-instanton follow from solving the same factorization condition (2.50) with\nthe matrix \u2206 = a+ bx\u00af. In this case the ADHM constraints are modified by the self-dual component of\n\u03b8:\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 = ~\u03b6(\u2212)1[k]\u00d7[k] . (11.16)\nThe explicit one-instanton and one-anti-instanton solutions for U(N) gauge theory were constructed\nin [190] for space-space, R2NC \u00d7 R2, and spacetime, R4NC, non-commutativity by resolving the corre-\nsponding (modified) ADHM constraints and solving the completeness relation (2.51). As always, one\nhas to distinguish between two types of singularities: the singularities of the instanton field Am(x) as\nthe function of the argument, and the singularities arising for certain values of the collective coordinates\ninterpreted as singularities on the moduli space. Instanton configurations can be determined in singular\nor regular gauges; in singular gauge all the singularities of instanton configurations as functions of xm\nare simply gauge artifacts and can be gauged away.\nInstantons with space-space non-commutativity arise from (11.15) where \u03b6 6= 0 and their moduli\nspace contains no singularities. Instantons with spacetime non-commutativity contain no singularities\non the moduli space unless the the self-duality of \u03b8 coincides with the self-duality of the instanton\nfield-strength such that the ADHM constraints (11.14) and (11.16) collapse to (2.59a).\nXI.1.2 The prepotential of non-commutative N = 2 gauge theory\nWe can now consider the N = 2 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory formulated in non-commutative\nspace. On the Coulomb branch, the gauge group is broken to U(1)c \u00d7 U(1)N\u22121, where U(1)c is the\noverall U(1) factor of the non-commutative U(N) gauge group which decouples in the infrared due to\nthe infra-red\/ultra-violet mixing as explained in Ref. [192]. Our goal is to determine the low-energy\ndynamics of the U(1)N\u22121 factor.\nIn a similar way to the ordinary commutative case reviewed in \u00a7VIII, the corresponding low-energy\neffective action is determined by the Seiberg-Witten prepotential F as explained in Refs. [192,193]. In\nparticular, note there are no commutative \u201cstar-products\u201d in the low energy effective action since we\nare concerned only with the leading-order terms in the derivative expansion of the effective action. As\nin the commutative theory, instantons and anti-instantons contribute to various correlation functions.\nBy considering the instanton contributions to these correlation functions one can relate the instanton\ncoefficients of the prepotential to the centred instanton partition function. We shall assume that the\nre-scalings (8.22) have been performed and so the relation is identical to (8.24). Although we did\nnot consider the anti-instanton contributions in Chapter VIII, one can easily derive an anti-instanton\n188\nversion of (8.24) which involves the complex conjugate of the prepotential. Summarizing, we have for\nk > 0\nFk = Z\u0302(N=2,NF )+k , F\u2217k = Z\u0302(N=2,NF )\u2212k . (11.17)\nHere, Z\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\n\u00b1k are the instanton and anti-instanton centred instanton partition functions of the non-\ncommutative theory and defined as integrals over the moduli spaces M\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n\u00b1k:\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\n\u00b1k =\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n\u00b1k\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF )e\u2212S\u02dc , (11.18)\nwhere, the supersymmetric volume form over the resolved centred instanton moduli space is explicitly\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n\u00b1k\n\u03c9\n(N ) = 2N\u22122\u03c02(N\u22121)\nC(N )k\nVolU(k)\n\u222b\nd4k(N+k)\u22124a\u02c6\nN\u220f\nA=1\nd2k(N+k)\u22122M\u02c6A \u2223\u2223detk2 L\u2223\u22231\u2212N\n\u00d7\nk2\u220f\nr=1\n{ 3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n2\ntrk T\nr(\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9a\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u03b6c(\u00b1)1[k]\u00d7[k])\n) N\u220f\nA=1\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\ntrk T\nr(M\u00afAa\u03b1\u02d9 + a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MA)\n)}\n.\n(11.19)\nThe expression is identical to the expression for the supersymmetric volume form of M\u0302k defined in\n\u00a7VI.5 apart from the fact that the bosonic ADHM constraints are modified appropriately to include the\ncentral terms.\nFrom (11.19) we conclude that the centred instanton partition function can only depend on ~\u03b6(+)\nwhile the centred anti-instanton function can only depend on ~\u03b6(\u2212). Given (11.17), the aforementioned\ndependences are very restrictive: the prepotential cannot depend on ~\u03b6 and therefore should be identical\nto that in the commutative theory. This was the hypothesis that was made in Ref. [192] for the theory\nwith no hypermultiplets. In the next section, we will develop a localization formalism in which we\ncan prove rigorously that the centred (anti-)instanton partition function cannot depend smoothly on\n~\u03b6(\u00b1). There are possible discontinuities when ~\u03b6(\u00b1) = 0, since at this points the (anti-)instanton moduli\nspace becomes singular and the localization formalism breaks down. However, we can already test\nthis hypothesis at the one-instanton level by re-doing the calculation of \u00a7VIII.4 in the context of the\nnon-commutative theory. It is simple to establish the modifications that arise from including the non-\ncommutativity parameter ~\u03b6. The instanton effective action (8.49) has the additional coupling\n4\u03c02i ~D \u00b7 ~\u03b6(+) . (11.20)\nThis modifies the ~D integral in (8.61)\u222b\nd3D\n~D2\ne\u22124\u03c0\n2i ~D\u00b7~\u03b6(+)\nN\u220f\nu=1\n\u03b1\u22172u\n|\u03b1u|4 + ~D2\n. (11.21)\nThe angular integrals over ~D = (| ~D|, \u03b8, \u03c6) are now non-trivial:\u222b\nd(cos \u03b8)d\u03b8e\u22124\u03c0\n2i ~D\u00b7~\u03b6(+) =\nsin(4\u03c02| ~D||~\u03b6(+)|)\n\u03c0| ~D||~\u03b6(+)|\n. (11.22)\nWe then extend the integral over | ~D| from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e and perform it by standard contour integration\nyielding\n1\n2|~\u03b6(+)|\n( N\u220f\nu=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n\u03b12u\n\u2212\nN\u2211\nu=1\n1\n\u03b12u\ne\u22124\u03c0\n2|~\u03b6(+)|\u03b12u\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n\u03b1\u22172v\n|\u03b1v|4 \u2212 |\u03b1u|4\n)\n. (11.23)\n189\ncompared with the right-hand side of (8.61). The behaviour of the modified integrand in the vicinity\nof one of the N singularities \u03c7 = \u2212\u03c60u, i.e. \u03b1u = 0, is\n2\u03c02\n\u03b1\u2217u\n\u03b1u\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n\u03b1\u22172v\n|\u03b1v|4 \u2212 |\u03b1u|4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (11.24)\nand so unmodified from the commutative calculation. The contribution to the centred instanton par-\ntition function from the N singularities is therefore unchanged from (8.66). However, the contribution\nfrom the sphere at infinity in \u03c7-space is modified since in the non-commutative case the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the integrand is changed. In fact contrary to (8.68) we now have\nf1(r, \u03b8) \u223c\ne\u22122iN\u03b8\nr2N\n(11.25)\nand consequently the contribution from the sphere at infinity vanishes because either the integrand\nf1(r, \u03b8)f2(re\ni\u03b8) falls off too fast, for NF < 2N , or due to a vanishing angular integral, for NF = 2N .\nHence, in the non-commutative theory the result for the one-instanton coefficient of the prepotential is\nFnc1 =\nN\u2211\nu=1\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n(\u03c60v \u2212 \u03c60u)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nu) . (11.26)\ncompared with (8.72) in the commutative case.\nNotice that the additional contribution denoted S(NF )1 which we identified as arising form the vicinity\nof the singularity on the instanton moduli space, is missing from the non-commutative result, as might\nhave been expected since the singularity of M\u03021 has been resolved. At the one-instanton level, we see\nthat the commutative and non-commutative results are equivalent up to an unimportant constant for\nNF < 2N . This is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that commutative and non-commutative\ntheories have the same SU(N) low-energy effective action. However, the finite theory with NF = 2N\ndoes have the apparently physically significant difference due to the term proportional to\n\u2211N\nu=1(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n2 that\narises in the commutative theory (8.72) but which is missing from (11.26). This difference, however,\nis not physically relevant since it can be explained by a re-definition of the coupling between the\ncommutative and non-commutative theories. This follows from the expression for the prepotential in\n(8.7). If the coupling in the non-commutative theory is related to that in the commutative theory by a\nseries of instanton couplings:\n\u03c4nc = \u03c4 +\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\ncke\n2\u03c0ik\u03c4 , (11.27)\nthen SU(N) part of the the low-energy of the non-commutative theory is equal to that of the commu-\ntative theory. At the one-instanton level we have\nc1 =\n\u03b12\n\u03c0i\n(11.28)\nand \u03b12 is the coefficient in (8.70). Matching the non-commutative and commutative theories requires\nfor higher instanton number a relation of the form\nFnck = Fk \u2212 2\u03c0idk\nN\u2211\nu=1\n(\u03c60u)\n2 , (11.29)\n190\nup to irrelevant (mass-dependent) constants, where dk are determined in terms of the ck. It is difficult to\nprove this relation rigorously. However, in the next section we prove that Fnck cannot depend smoothly\non ~\u03b6(+), hence, the difference Fnck \u2212 Fk cannot depend on ~\u03b6(+). Then assuming that the contribution\nto the difference arises from the sphere at infinity in \u03c7-space,86 generalizing the situation at the one-\ninstanton level, the result can be argued to be polynomial in the masses and VEVs. Given that the\nprepotential has mass-dimension 2, this leaves (11.29) as the only possible VEV dependence.\nIt should not have escaped the readers notice that something unexpected happens in the finite theory\nwhen the non-commutativity parameters are chosen so that either ~\u03b6(+) = 0 or ~\u03b6(\u2212) = 0. In the former\ncase, the instantons are those of the non-commutative theory, described by the smooth moduli space\nM\n(\u03b6)\n1 , while the anti-instantons are conventional commutative ones, described by the singular space M1.\nIn this case, even at the one-instanton level (11.17) is violated since the anti-instantons receive the\ncontribution S((NF=2N)1 from the singularity on the instanton moduli space, while the anti-instantons do\nnot; hence\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\n+1 6=\n(\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\n\u22121\n)\u2217\n. (11.30)\nIn addition, a re-definition of the form (11.27) cannot reconcile the commutative and non-commutative\ntheories. It is not clear how one should describe what is really happening at these points in the non-\ncommutativity parameter space and whether the resulting behaviour of the low-energy effective action\nis physically acceptable.\nXI.2 Calculating the prepotential by localization\nThe major applications of the many instanton calculus that we have hitherto reported (the two-instanton\ncontribution to the SU(2) prepotential in \u00a7VIII.3.1 excepted) have involved a large-N limit. Clearly\none would like techniques to calculate instanton effects for any N and k. The problem is obvious: the\nintegrals over the instanton moduli space are just too complicated to be done by brute force beyond\ninstanton number one (or two in the special case of gauge group SU(2)). Even the integral over the\none-instanton moduli space required to obtain the first instanton coefficient of the prepotential with\nSU(N) gauge group, undertaken in \u00a7VIII.4 was far from elementary.\nHowever there is hope: there is interesting mathematical structure underlying the integrals over the\ninstanton moduli space that define the instanton partition function and hence the instanton coefficients\nof the prepotential. They are related to integrals that give topological invariants; for example, in the\nN = 4 case the integral is precisely the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern integral that\u2014at least on a compact\nmanifold\u2014gives the Euler characteristic.87 When the theory is on the Coulomb branch instantons are\nconstrained and there is a non-trivial potential on the instanton moduli space caused by the non-trivial\ninstanton effective action. This acts as a Morse potential and the integrals localize around various\nsubspaces of the instanton moduli space around which the quadratic approximation is exact. This kind\nof localization is a generalization of the Duistermaat-Heckman Integration Formula that arises in various\n86This should follow from the localization technology developed in the next section.\n87We do not discuss the mass-deformed N = 4 to N = 2 theory in this review: see [176].\n191\nsupersymmetric contexts (see, for example, [194\u2013198] and references therein). The obvious problem to\nusing this theory is the fact that the instanton moduli space is non-compact and has singularities when\ninstantons shrink to zero size. The problem with the singularities can be be alleviated by considering\nthe resolution of the instanton moduli space M\n(\u03b6)\nk relevant to a non-commutative theory as described\nin \u00a7XI.1. It will turn out that the integrals over the instanton moduli space in the non-commutative\nversion of the theory on the Higgs or Coulomb branch is amenable to a form of localization. This will\nallow us to calculate the two-instanton contribution to the prepotential in an SU(N) (or rather U(N)\nsince in the non-commutative version the additional abelian factor is inevitably included) theory. In\nfact the localization method greatly simplifies the integrals even at the k > 2 level and we expect that\nfurther progress may be possible.\nIn retrospect it should not be a surprise that the instanton partition function localizes in the non-\ncommutative theory. We will show that the subspaces of M\u0302\n(\u03b6)\nk on which the instanton partition function\nlocalizes correspond to products of (non-commutative) U(1) moduli spaces M\u0302\n(\u03b6)\nk\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n. In fact the lo-\ncalization submanifolds are associated to each partition of k \u2192 k1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + kN , ku \u2265 0, and have the\nform\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\nk \u2212\u2192\n\u22c3\npartitions\nk1,...,kN\nM\n(\u03b6)\nk1\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7M(\u03b6)kN\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\nR4\n, (11.31)\nwhere the quotient is by the overall centre of the instanton. This is a manifestation of the fact that in the\nnon-commutative theory there are exact\u2014no longer constrained\u2014instanton solutions on the Coulomb\nbranch. The reason is that the non-commutativity prevents instantons shrinking to zero size and there\nare now stable solutions of infinite size and the consequences of Derrick\u2019s theorem are avoided. The fact\nthat these solutions are exact even in the presence of a VEV follows because the non-trivial fields only\ntake values in the U(1)N subgroup of the U(N) gauge group and so these fields commute with the VEVs.\nThe partitions correspond to the instanton charge ku in each of the N U(1) subgroups. It is then an\nissue as how one can relate the prepotential in the non-commutative theory to that in the commutative\ntheory. We have already argued in \u00a7XI.1.2 that they must essentially be the same. Our calculations\nat the one- and two-instanton level confirm this hypothesis, up to an interesting re-parameterization of\nthe coupling in the theory with NF = 2N .\nBefore proceeding with the more convenient formalism (from the point-of-view of performing actual\ncomputations) based on the linearized instanton partition function constructed in \u00a7VI.5, it is useful to\nconsider the problem in terms of the intrinsic geometry of Mk. We first note in the N = 2 theory,\nthe number of Grassmann collective coordinates (we consider only the case NF = 0 for the moment)\nequals the dimension of Mk; namely, 4kN . We have already seen in \u00a7IV.2.2 that the Grassmann\ncollective coordinates \u03c8A, for each species A, can be thought of as the components of Grassmann-\nvalued symplectic tangent vectors to Mk. In the N = 2 case, there is also an isomorphism between\nthem and the symplectic basis of one forms\n\u03c8iA \u2194 hi\u03b1\u02d9 , \u03b1\u02d9 \u2261 A . (11.32)\nHere, the one forms hi\u03b1\u02d9 manifest the Sp(n)\u00d7SU(2) structure of the (co-)tangent space of TMk and are\nrelated to the inverse Vielbeins via hi\u03b1\u02d9 = hi\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5dX\n\u00b5 (see Appendix B). Note that the isomorphism (11.32)\n192\npreserves the structure of differential calculus: both Grassmann variables and one forms anti-commute.\nIn addition, the N = 2 supersymmetric volume form on Mk (5.15) can be re-interpreted in terms of\ndifferential forms:\u222b\nMk\n\u03c9\n(N=2)F(X,\u03c8iA) = \u03c0\u22122kN\n\u222b\nMk\n{ 2kN\u2227\ni=1\n2\u2227\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\nhi\u03b1\u02d9\n}{ 2kN\u220f\ni=1\n2\u220f\nA=1\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c8iA\n}\nF(X,\u03c8iA)\n= \u03c0\u22122kN\n\u222b\nMk\nF(X, hi\u03b1\u02d9) (\u03b1\u02d9 = A) ,\n(11.33)\nwhere the function F is expanded in wedge powers of the forms hi\u03b1\u02d9 until a top form is obtained which\ncan then be integrated .\nUsing the isomorphism between the Grassmann collective coordinates and one forms, the instanton\neffective action (5.42) for N = 2 (so the final curvature coupling is absent) can be written succinctly as\nthe inhomogeneous differential form\nS\u02dc = \u22121\n4\ndV\n(\nV \u2020\u00b5dX\n\u00b5\n)\n. (11.34)\nHere, V and V \u2020 are the (anti-)holomorphic components (defined as in (4.20)) of the (commuting) tri-\nholomorphic vector fields on Mk denoted Va, a = 1, 2, introduced in \u00a7V.2.1, associated to the VEVs.\nThe other quantity in (11.34) is an equivariant exterior derivative88\ndV \u2261 d\u2212 2\u0131V . (11.35)\nOne can easily verify that\nd2V = 2LV , (11.36)\nthe Lie derivative with respect to V . Hence, dV is nilpotent on SU(N)-invariant differential forms. The\ncentred instanton partition function can then be written in form notation as\nZ\u0302\n(N=2)\nk = \u03c0\n\u22122kN\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\n4\ndV (V\n\u2020\n\u00b5dX\n\u00b5)\n)\n, (11.37)\nwhich means that the terms must be pulled down from the instanton effective action in order to make\na top form on the centred moduli space M\u0302k (of degree 4kN \u2212 4).\nThe final form (11.37) is precisely the kind that can localize. To see this consider the more general\nintegral\nZ\u0302\n(N=2)\nk (\u03bb) = \u03c0\n\u22122kN\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\nexp\n(\n\u2212 \u03bb\u22121dV (V \u2020\u00b5dX\u00b5)\n)\n. (11.38)\nWe then have\n\u2202Z\u0302(N=2)k (\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03bb\n= \u03c0\u22122kN\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03bb\u22122dV\n{\nV \u2020\u00b5dX\n\u00b5 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03bb\u22121dV (V \u2020\u00b5dX\u00b5)\n)}\n(11.39)\nusing the fact that d2V is nilpotent on SU(N)-invariant quantities. But since the volume form is SU(N)\ninvariant the integral\u2014under favourable conditions\u2014vanishes and so Z\u0302(N=2)k (\u03bb) is independent of \u03bb.\n88Here, \u0131V implies contraction with the vector V .\n193\nHence, it can be evaluated in the limit \u03bb \u2192 0 where the integral is dominated by the saddle-point\napproximation around the critical points of the vector field Va. In the present case, the fixed-point set\nhas been identified in \u00a7V.2.2 with the configurations where all the instantons have shrunk to zero size.\nThe potential problem is that the theory of localization is most easy to apply to situations involving\ncompact spaces without boundary. In the case at hand, the instanton moduli space is obviously not\ncompact and has conical singularities when instanton shrink to zero sized. As we have already intimated,\nthe way to alleviate the problems caused by the singularities is to consider the analogous problem in\nthe theory defined on a non-commutative spacetime. As explained in \u00a7XI.1, the deformed instanton\nmoduli space M\n(\u03b6)\nk is then a smooth resolution of Mk: instantons can no longer shrink to zero size and\nthe corresponding canonical singularities are smoothed over. In this case, as we shall find below, the\ntechnique of localization can be used to considerably simplify the computation of the centred instanton\npartition function. In particular the critical-point sets become smooth manifolds of a very suggestive\nform.\nThe problem with formulating localization in terms of the intrinsic geometry of the instanton moduli\nspace is that, due to the presence of the ADHM constraints, we do not have an explicit description of\nthe intrinsic geometry. It will prove much more convenient to work in terms of the linearized formalism\ndescribed in \u00a7VI.5. It will also prove easier to formulate the theory of localization in terms of Grassmann\nvariables instead of differential forms. The expression for the centred instanton partition is (6.103).89\nIn the language of Grassmann variables, the translation of the covariant derivative is a fermionic\nsymmetry Q, or BRST operator, which is nilpotent\u2014at least up to symmetries. The fermionic sym-\nmetry that we need to prove the localization properties of the integrals is defined by picking out a\nparticular supersymmetry transformation. These latter symmetries, acting on the variables of the lin-\nearized formulation, are given in (10.64b) and (6.85). From the supersymmetry transformations we can\ndefine corresponding supercharges via \u03b4 = \u03be\u03b1\u02d9AQ\n\u03b1\u02d9A. The fermionic symmetry that has the appropriate\nproperties is then defined as the combination90\nQ = \u01eb\u03b1\u02d9AQ\u03b1\u02d9A . (11.40)\nNotice that the definition of Q mixes up spacetime and R-symmetry indices as is characteristic of\n89We also perform the re-scaling (8.22) so that there are no factors of g in the instanton effective action (6.96).\n90Note that a BRST-type operator was first constructed in the context of theN = 2 instanton calculus in Refs. [199\u2013201].\n(In particular, the latter reference is most closely related to the approach that we adopt in this paper.) In particular,\nthese references emphasize the relation with the topologically twisted version of the original gauge theory. However,\nthese references did not go on to use the existence of Q to develop a calculational technique based on localization. A\nnilpotent fermionic symmetry was also constructed in the context of the N = 4 instanton calculus in Ref. [176] where\nlocalization was first proposed as a method to calculate, in this case the N = 4, instanton partition function. It was\nthen shown in [199] that the Q operator in the N = 2 theory could be obtained by the orbifolding procedure described\nin \u00a7X.3.3 in the present article. Some recent papers [202] have also considered the Q-operator and the N = 2 instanton\ncalculus, although they use the equivalent language of differential forms described above. These references then go some\nway toward interpreting Fk as a topological intersection number.\n194\ntopological twisting.

(11.41e)\nIt is straightforward to show that Q is nilpotent up to an infinitesimal U(k) \u00d7 SU(N) transformation\ngenerated by \u03c7 and \u03c6. For example,\nQ2 w\u03b1\u02d9 = 2i(w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7+ \u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9) . (11.42)\nIn terms of Q, the instanton effective action (6.96) assumes the form\nS\u02dc = Q\u039e + \u0393 , (11.43)\nwith\n\u039e = 4\u03c02trk\n{\n1\n2\n\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9Aw\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u00b5A\u03c7\u2020 + \u03c60\u2020\u00b5A\n)\n+ 1\n4\n\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9Aa\u00af\n\u2032\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1[M\u2032A\u03b1 , \u03c7\u2020] + \u03b4A\u03b1\u02d9\u03c8\u00af\u03b2\u02d9A\n(\na\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a\u03b2\u02d9 \u2212 12~\u03b6(+) \u00b7 ~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n)}\n(11.44)\nand\n\u0393 = \u2212\u03c02\nNF\u2211\nf=1\ntrk\n(\n(mf \u2212 \u03c7)KfK\u02dcf\n)\n. (11.45)\nNote that Q\u0393 = 0 so that the instanton effective action is \u201cQ-closed\u201d: Q S\u02dc = 0. Notice in (11.44), to\nanticipate what follows, we have allowed for a non-trivial non-commutativity parameter ~\u03b6(+).\nNotice that both the action S\u02dc and the integration measure \u03c9(N=2,NF ) areQ-invariant. The localization\nargument argument proceeds as before. Consider the general integral\nZ\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk (\u03bb) =\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF ) exp\n(\u2212 \u03bb\u22121Q\u039e\u2212 \u0393) . (11.46)\nWe then have\n\u2202Z\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk (\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03bb\n= \u03bb\u22122\n\u222b\nM\u0302k\n\u03c9\n(N=2,NF )Q\n{\n\u039e exp\n(\u2212 \u03bb\u22121Q\u039e\u2212 \u0393)} , (11.47)\nusing the fact that Q2 \u039e = Q\u0393 = 0. Since the volume form is Q-invariant the right-hand side of (11.47)\nvanishes. Consequently, Z\u0302\n(N=2,NF )\nk (\u03bb) is independent of \u03bb and can, therefore, be evaluated in the limit\n\u03bb\u2192 0 where the integral is dominated by the critical points of Q\u039e. Since the result is independent of \u03bb,\nunder favourable circumstances\u2014which will be shown to hold in the present application\u2014the Gaussian\napproximation is exact.\nNote that the quantity \u039e depends on ~\u03b6(+) and the anti-holomorphic components of the VEV. Hence,\nthe derivative of the instanton effective action with respect to either ~\u03b6(+) or \u03c6\n0\u2020 is Q-exact and so the\ninstanton partition function cannot depend on these parameters. On the contrary, the holomorphic\ncomponents of the VEVs enter through the action of Q itself, while the hypermultiplet masses enter\n195\nthrough \u0393, and so the centred instanton partition function can depend on these parameters. In particu-\nlar, from what we have said above, we have proved that the centred instanton partition function cannot\ndepend smoothly on the non-commutativity parameter ~\u03b6(+). Of course, there will be a discontinuity\nwhen ~\u03b6(+) = 0 when singularities appear on the instanton moduli space and the localization argument\nbreaks down.\nFollowing the logic of localization we should investigate the critical points of Q\u039e. For the moment\nwe suppose ~\u03b6(+) = 0. The terms to minimize are, from (10.39),\u2223\u2223w\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a + \u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9\u2223\u22232 \u2212 [\u03c7a, a\u2032n]2 . (11.48)\nNotice that this is positive semi-definite and the critical points are simply the zeros. Hence\nw\u03b1\u02d9\u03c7a + \u03c6aw\u03b1\u02d9 = [\u03c7a, a\n\u2032\nn] = 0 . (11.49)\nNotice that these equations are identical to those in (5.43). Hence we can identify the critical-points of\nQ\u039e which the fixed points of the tri-holomorphic vector fields generated by the VEVs. The fixed-point\nset corresponds to the singular subspace Symk R4 where all the instanton have shrunk down to zero size\nand the resulting gauge potential is pure gauge.\nIn order to avoid the singular nature of point-like instantons, Ref. [95] suggested a regularization\nbased on the smooth resolution of the instanton moduli space first described in purely geometrical\nterms without reference to the gauge theory by Nakajima in Ref. [182]. Of course, as discussed in\n\u00a7XI.1, subsequently it was realized that this smooth resolution of the instanton moduli space M(\u03b6)k\narises naturally when the theory is defined on a non-commutative spacetime [184]. What happens is\nthat the existence of the central term in the ADHM constraints (11.1) prevents instantons shrinking to\nzero size. The solutions are associated to the partitions (5.44) and have the form (5.46). The ADHM\nconstraints within the uth block are now the ADHM constraints are now those of a non-commutative\ngauge theory with a U(1) gauge group. Taking the trace of the ADHM constraints within the block we\nhave\n~\u03c4 \u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\nku\u2211\ni=ku\u22121+1\nw\u00af\u03b2\u02d9iuwui\u03b1\u02d9 = ku\n~\u03b6(+) . (11.50)\nNow, in contrast to (5.47), in the presence of the central term, wui\u03b1\u02d9 must be non-trivial. The critical-\npoint set associated to the partition (5.44) is consequently a product of non-commutative U(1) instanton\nmoduli spaces:\nM\n(\u03b6)\nk1\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7M(\u03b6)kN\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\nR4\n. (11.51)\nRecall from the discussion in \u00a7XI.1 that M(\u03b6)k\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\nis a smooth resolution of the symmetric product\nSymkR4.\nIn fact in the non-commutative theory the consequences of Derrick\u2019s Theorem are avoided and there\nare now exact non-singular solutions to the equations-of-motion even in the presence of VEVs. These\nexact solutions were called \u201ctopicons\u201d in [96] since they have a contribution to the action which is\nlocalized and, unlike an instanton, they have no size modulus. Actually there are N flavours of topicon,\n196\nassociated the N block in (5.44), obtained by embedding the spacetime non-commutative U(1) instanton\nsolutions in each of N unbroken abelian factors of the gauge group. So the following picture emerges.\nFor instanton charge k, the exact instanton solutions come as a disjoint union of spaces associated to\nthe inequivalent partitions (5.44) where each ku corresponds to each of N U(1) subgroups picked out\nby the VEV. Hence, the space of exact solutions, or \u201cmoduli space of topicons\u201d, lying within the larger\ninstanton moduli space is of the form\nM\u0302k\nresolve\u2212\u2192 M\u0302(\u03b6)k\nexact\u2283 M\u0302(\u03b6)k\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\ntopicon\n=\n\u22c3\npartitions\nk1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+kN\nM\n(\u03b6)\nk1\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7M(\u03b6)kN\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\nR4\n. (11.52)\nXI.2.1 One instanton\nWe will now begin using localization to evaluate the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential of\nthe N = 2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with NF hypermultiplets. The instanton effective\naction (6.96) has N critical points, labelled by v \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N}, at which (5.46)\n\u03c7a = \u2212(\u03c60a)v , wu\u03b1\u02d9 \u221d \u03b4uv . (11.53)\nNote that a\u2032n = 0 in the one-instanton sector. Without-loss-of-generality, we choose our non-commutativity\nparameters\n\u03b61\n(+)\n= \u03b62\n(+)\n= 0 , \u03b63\n(+)\n\u2261 \u03b6 > 0 . (11.54)\nIn this case the ADHM constraints (11.1) are solved on the critical submanifold with\nwu\u03b1\u02d9 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6ei\u03b8\u03b4uv\u03b4\u03b1\u02d91 , (11.55)\nfor an arbitrary phase angle \u03b8. The integrals over wv\u03b1\u02d9 are then partially annulled by the three \u03b4-\nfunctions in (3.17) that impose the ADHM constraints, leaving a trivial integral over the phase angle\n\u03b8: \u222b\nd2wv d\n2w\u00afv\n3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\n1\n2\n\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9(w\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\nvwv\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b4c3)\n)\n= 8\u03c0\u03b6\u22121 . (11.56)\nCorrespondingly, the \u03b4-functions for the Grassmann ADHM constraints saturate the integrals over\n{\u00b5Av , \u00b5\u00afAv }: \u222b\nd\u00b5Av d\u00b5\u00af\nA\nv\n2\u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1\n\u03b4\n(\nw\u00afv\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5\nA\nv + wv\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5\u00af\nA\nv\n)\n= \u03b6 , (11.57)\nfor each A = 1, 2. The remaining variables, {wu\u03b1\u02d9, \u00b5Au , \u00b5\u00afAu }, u 6= v, as well as {Kif , K\u02dcfi}, are all treated\nas Gaussian fluctuations around the critical point. To this order, the instanton effective action (6.96) is\nS\u02dc = 4\u03c02\n{\n\u03b6\u03c72a +\nN\u2211\nu=1\n( 6=v)\n(\n(\u03c6a)\n2\nvu\n\u2223\u2223wu\u03b1\u02d9\u2223\u22232 + i2\u03c60\u2020vu\u00b5\u00afAu\u00b5uA)\u2212 14 NF\u2211\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nv)KfK\u02dcf\n}\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (11.58)\nwhere (\u03c60a)uv \u2261 (\u03c60a)u \u2212 (\u03c60a)v. The integrals are easily done. Note that the integral over \u03c7a yields a\nfactor of \u03b6\u22121 which cancels against the factors of \u03b6 arising from (11.56) and (11.57) so the final result is,\n197\nas expected, independent of \u03b6 . Summing over the N critical-point sets gives the centred one-instanton\npartition function\nFnc1 \u2261 Z\u0302(N=2,NF )1 =\nN\u2211\nv=1\n{ N\u220f\nu=1\n( 6=v)\n1\n(\u03c60v \u2212 \u03c60u)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nv)\n}\n. (11.59)\nNotice that the resulting expression is holomorphic in the VEVs and independent of \u03b6 as required.\nThe result should be compared with the brute-force calculation of the one-instanton contribution in\n(8.72). The expression is entirely consistent with (11.59) for NF < 2N .\n91 We can also compare (11.59)\nwith the predictions of Seiberg-Witten theory written down in (8.8a). The expression agree for all for\nNF < 2N . Recall that the Seiberg-Witten predictions as written are only valid for NF < 2N ; however,\nour expression (11.59) is simply the obviously extrapolation of (8.8a) to NF = 2N .\nThe case with NF = 2N , which corresponds to the finite theory, is rather special. Notice that the\nexpression in the non-commutative theory misses the contribution S(NF=2N)1 of (8.72) which is quadratic\nin the VEVs. We have already identified this term as arising from the singularity of the one-instanton\nmoduli space M\u03021. However, we have already argued at the end of \u00a7XI.1.2 that the mismatch is not\nphysically relevant since it can be accommodated by a non-trivial mapping between the couplings of\nthe commutative and non-commutative theories.\nXI.2.2 Two instantons\nWe now turn to the situation for k = 2. There are two kinds critical-point corresponding to two topicons\nof the same, or of different, flavour, respectively. We now evaluate these two contribution separately.\nAs in the one-instanton sector we choose the non-commutativity parameters as in (11.54).\nTwo topicons of different flavour\nFor two topicons of the different flavour, the ADHM constraints are solved with\nwui\u03b1\u02d9 =\n\u221a\n\u03b6ei\u03b8i\u03b4uui\u03b4\u03b1\u02d91 , a\n\u2032\nn =\n(\nYn 0\n0 \u2212Yn\n)\n. (11.60)\nThe two phase angles \u03b8i, i = 1, 2, are not genuine moduli since they can be separately rotated by\ntransformations in the U(2) auxiliary group. The variables Yn are the genuine moduli representing the\nrelative positions of the two topicons. The corresponding solution of the fermionic ADHM constraints\n(4.34) on the critical-point set is\n\u00b5A = \u00b5\u00afA = 0 , M\u2032A\u03b1 =\n(\n\u03c1A\u03b1 0\n0 \u2212\u03c1A\u03b1\n)\n, (11.61)\nwhere \u03c1A\u03b1 are the superpartners of Yn. Notice in this case the critical-point set is non-compact since the\nseparation Yn \u2208 R4. The issue of whether the integral over Yn converges is rather delicate. By explicit\ncalculation we shall find that the integral is indeed convergent.\n91The constant factor S(NF )1 for NF = 2N \u2212 2 and 2N \u2212 1 does not affect the low energy effective action which depends\nonly on derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the VEVs.\n198\nWe now proceed to evaluate the contribution to the centred instanton partition function from the\ncritical-point set. First we expand around the critical values (11.60) and (11.61). It is convenient to\nuse the following notation for the fluctuations\n\u03b4a\u2032n =\n(\n0 Zn\nZ\u2217n 0\n)\n, \u03b4M\u2032A\u03b1 =\n(\n0 \u03c3A\u03b1\n\u03b5A\u03b1 0\n)\n(11.62)\nand to make the shift\n\u03c7a \u2192 \u03c7a \u2212\n(\n(\u03c60a)u1 0\n0 (\u03c60a)u2\n)\n, (11.63)\nso that \u03c7a = 0 on the critical submanifold. We then integrate over the Lagrange multipliers ~D and \u03c8\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\nA\nwhich impose the ADHM constraints (2.65) and (4.34). The diagonal components of the constraints (in\ni, j indices) are the ADHM constraints of the two single U(1) instantons. The off-diagonal components\nvanish on the critical-point set and must therefore be expanded to linear order in the fluctuations. For\nthe bosonic variables we have\u221a\n\u03b6e\u2212i\u03b81(wu12)2 +\n\u221a\n\u03b6ei\u03b82(wu21)\n\u2217\n2 + 4i\u03b7\u00af\n1\nmnYmZn = 0 , (11.64a)\n\u2212i\n\u221a\n\u03b6e\u2212i\u03b81(wu12)2 + i\n\u221a\n\u03b6ei\u03b82(wu21)\n\u2217\n2 + 4i\u03b7\u00af\n2\nmnYmZn = 0 , (11.64b)\u221a\n\u03b6e\u2212i\u03b81(wu12)1 +\n\u221a\n\u03b6ei\u03b82(wu21)\n\u2217\n1 + 4i\u03b7\u00af\n3\nmnYmZn = 0 , (11.64c)\nwhere \u03b7\u00afcmn =\n1\n2i\ntr2(\u03c4\nc\u03c3\u00afm\u03c3n) are \u2019t Hooft\u2019s \u03b7-symbols defined in Appendix A.

It is convenient to define\n(wu12)1 = e\ni\u03b81(\u03be + \u03bb) , (wu21)\n\u2217\n1 = e\n\u2212i\u03b82(\u2212\u03be + \u03bb) , (11.66)\nso that the fluctuations \u03be drops out from (11.64c). We can use (11.64a)-(11.64c) to solve for (wu12)2,\n(wu21)2 and \u03bb, and (11.65a)-(11.65d) to solve for \u00b5\nA\n1u2 , \u00b5\nA\n2u1 , \u00b5\u00af\nA\nu12 and \u00b5\u00af\nA\nu21. We then use the U(2)\nsymmetry to fix (i) the fluctuation Zn to be orthogonal to Yn, ZnYn = 0; and (ii) \u03b8i = 0.

(11.83)\nFinally all that remains is to integrate over the relative position of the instantons. As promised the\nintegral is convergent: \u222b\nd4Y\n\u03b62\n(\u03b6 + 4Y 2)4\n=\n\u03c02\n96\n. (11.84)\nPutting all the pieces together with the correct numerical factors gives the final contribution of the\ncritical-point set to the centred instanton partition function\n2\n(\u03c60u1u2)\n6\n2\u220f\ni=1\nN\u220f\nu=1\n( 6=u1,u2)\n1\n(\u03c60uui)\n2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + \u03c6\n0\nu1\n)(mf + \u03c6\n0\nu2\n) . (11.85)\nNotice that the result is holomorphic in the VEVs as required. Summing over the 1\n2\nN(N \u2212 1) critical-\npoints for topicons of different flavours, we have the following contribution\nN\u2211\nu,v=1\n(u 6=v)\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu)Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n(\u03c60u \u2212 \u03c60v)2\n, (11.86)\n201\nwhere we have written the answer in terms of the functions\nSu(x) \u2261\nN\u220f\nv=1\n( 6=u)\n1\n(x\u2212 \u03c60v)2\nNF\u220f\nf=1\n(mf + x) (11.87)\ndefined in [90].\nTwo topicons of the same flavour\nThere are N critical-points of this type, describing two topicons of the same flavour: u1 = u2 \u2261 v \u2208\n{1, . . . , N}. On the critical submanifold {wvi\u03b1\u02d9, a\u2032n} and {\u00b5Avi, \u00b5\u00afAiv,M\u2032A\u03b1 } satisfy the ADHM constraints,\n(11.1) and (4.34), respectively, of two instantons in a non-commutative U(1) theory. The remaining\nvariables all vanish and are treated as fluctuations around the critical-point set.\nAs previously, it is convenient to shift the auxiliary variable \u03c7a by its critical-point value:\n\u03c7a \u2192 \u03c7a \u2212 (\u03c60a)v1[2]\u00d7[2] . (11.88)\nWe now expand in the fluctuations {wui\u03b1\u02d9, \u00b5Aui, \u00b5\u00afAiu}, for u 6= v, as well as {Kif , K\u02dcfi}. Since all the\ncomponents of the ADHM constraints are non-trivial at leading order the fluctuations decouple from\nthe \u03b4-functions in (3.17) and (5.53) which impose the constraints. The fluctuation integrals only involve\nthe integrand exp\u2212S\u02dc, where S\u02dc is expanded to Gaussian order around the critical-point set. However,\nit is important, as we shall see below, to leave \u03c7a arbitrary rather than set it to its critical-point value;\nnamely, \u03c7a = 0, after the shift (11.88). The fluctuation integrals produce the non-trivial factor\nN\u220f\nu=1\n( 6=v)\n1(\ndet2(\u03c7 + \u03c60uv1[2]\u00d7[2])\n)2 NF\u220f\nf=1\ndet2\n(\n(mf +\n\u221a\n2\u03c60v)1[2]\u00d7[2] \u2212 \u03c7\n)\n= Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv \u2212 \u03bb1)Sv(\u03c60v \u2212 \u03bb2) . (11.89)\nHere, \u03bbi, i = 1, 2, are the eigenvalues of the 2\u00d7 2 matrix \u03c7 and Su(x) was defined in (11.87).\nThe remaining integrals involve the supersymmetric volume integral on M\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n, into which we\ninsert the integrand (11.89) which depends non-trivially on \u03c7. Now by itself\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2) = 0. This\nis clear from the linearized form of the instanton effective action (6.96) with N = 1 and NF = 0:\nintegrals over the Grassmann collective coordinates pull down two elements of the matrix \u03c7\u2020 from the\naction and since there are no compensating factors of \u03c7 the resulting integrals over the phases of the\nelements of \u03c7 will integrate to zero. This is why we left \u03c7 arbitrary in (11.89) since after expanding in\npowers of the eigenvalues \u03bbi it is potentially the quadratic terms that will give a non-zero result when\ninserted into\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2). To quadratic order (11.89) is\n1\n2\nSv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u22022Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u2202(\u03c60v)\n2\n(\u03bb21 + \u03bb\n2\n2) +\n\u2202Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u2202\u03c60v\n\u2202Sv(\u03c6v)\n\u2202\u03c60v\n\u03bb1\u03bb2 . (11.90)\nSo the contribution from this critical-point set is of the form\nI1Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u22022Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u2202(\u03c60v)\n2\n+ I2\n\u2202Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u2202\u03c60v\n\u2202Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n\u2202\u03c60v\n}\n, (11.91)\n202\nwhere the VEV-independent constants I1,2 are given by the following integrals\nI1 =\n1\n2\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2) (\u03bb21 + \u03bb\n2\n2) \u2261\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2)\n(\n1\n2\n(tr2\u03c7)\n2 \u2212 det2\u03c7\n)\n,\nI2 =\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2) \u03bb1\u03bb2 \u2261\n\u222b\nM\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\n\u03c9\n(N=2) det2\u03c7 .\n(11.92)\nWe remark that (11.91) is holomorphic in the VEVs as required.\nThe moduli space M\u0302\n(\u03b6)\n2\n\u2223\u2223\nN=1\nis the Eguchi-Hanson manifold [186], a well-known four-dimensional\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler space [203]. So after all the Grassmann variables and \u03c7a have been integrated out, we\ncan write I1,2 as integrals over the Eguchi-Hanson space of a suitable integrand. The following results\nwere proved in the Appendix of [95]:\nI1 =\n1\n4\n, I2 = 0 . (11.93)\nHence the final result for the contributions from theN critical points of this type to the centred instanton\npartition function is\n1\n4\nN\u2211\nu=1\nSu(\u03c6u)\n\u22022Su(\u03c6u)\n\u2202(\u03c60u)\n2\n. (11.94)\nFinally, summing (11.94) and (11.86) we have the centred two-instanton partition function\nFnc2 \u2261 Z\u03022 =\nN\u2211\nu,v=1\n(u 6=v)\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu)Sv(\u03c6\n0\nv)\n(\u03c60u \u2212 \u03c60v)2\n+ 1\n4\nN\u2211\nu=1\nSu(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n\u22022Su(\u03c6\n0\nu)\n\u2202(\u03c60u)\n2\n. (11.95)\nFor N < 2NF it is astonishing to find exact agreement with the prediction from Seiberg-Witten theory\n(8.8b). As in the one-instanton sector, our expression (11.95) with NF = 2N is simply the extrapolation\nof the formula (8.8b). We can also compare (11.95) with the explicit brute-force integration over the\ninstanton moduli space for gauge group SU(2) that we reviewed in \u00a7VIII.3.1. The agreement is exact\nfor NF < 4. As in the one-instanton sector the case with NF = 4 is rather special since we expect\nthe non-trivial matching of the coupling constants of the commutative and non-commutative theories\ndisplayed in (11.27). At the two-instanton level this matching implies\nF2 = Fnc2 + 2\u03c0ic1Fnc1 + i\u03c0c2\nN\u2211\nu=1\n(\u03c60u)\n2 , (11.96)\nmodulo constants. Since we have already determined c1 in (11.28) this matching condition is non-trivial\neven for gauge group SU(2) since the coefficients depend non-trivially on the masses and the VEVs.\nUsing (11.59), (11.95) (for N = 2) and (8.45), all with NF = 4, one finds complete consistency with\nc2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nSU(2)\n=\n1\n23\u03c0i\n(\n1 +\n7\n2435\n\u2212 13\n24\n)\n. (11.97)\nThe question is whether the localization technique can be extended beyond two instantons? In fact\nit already has in the context of the N = 4 theory softly broken to N = 2 by mass terms as described\n203\nin Ref. [96]. In this reference the leading-order terms in the mass expansion of the prepotential were\ncalculated to all orders in the instanton charge and were shown to agree with the predictions of Seiberg-\nWitten theory. It is clear that this subject is moving quickly and it seems possible that one might be\nable to provide a completely self-contained instanton proof of Seiberg-Witten theory.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Massimo Bianchi, Chong-Sun Chu, Ed Corrigan, Francesco Fucito, Michael\nGreen, Prem Kumar, Werner Nahm, Hugh Osborn, Misha Shifman, Gabriele Travaglini, Arkady Vain-\nshtein and Stefan Vandoren for a wide variety of discussions on the instanton calculus and related\nsubjects.\n204\nAppendix A: Spinors in Diverse Dimensions\nIn this appendix we define our conventions for spinors in various dimensions.

A Dirac spinor is\n\u03c8 =\n(\n\u03c8\u03b1\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n)\n. (A.12)\nIn Euclidean space the Weyl spinors are pseudo real and so \u03c8\u03b1 and \u03c8\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9 are independent quantities. In\nMinkowski space the Weyl spinors are complex and one can define a four-component Majorana spinor\nof the form (A.12) with\n\u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = (\u03c8\u03b1)\n\u2020 , \u03b1\u02d9 = \u03b1 . (A.13)\nIn this notation, the \u03c3-matrices have indices \u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 and \u03c3\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\nn . In both Minkowski and Euclidean space,\nthe indices are raised and lowered with the anti-symmetric tensor \u01eb:\n\u01eb21 = \u01eb\n12 = 1 , \u01eb12 = \u01eb\n21 = \u22121 , \u01eb11 = \u01eb22 = 0 . (A.14)\nIn addition, we use the summation conventions:\n\u03c8\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c8\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c8\u00af\u03c6\u00af = \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c6\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 . (A.15)\nIn six-dimensional Euclidean space we take\n\u0393a =\n(\n0 \u03a3a\n\u03a3\u00afa 0\n)\n, (A.16)\nwhere the \u03a3-matrices are defined as\n\u03a3a =\n(\n\u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3, \u03b72, i\u03b7\u00af2, \u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1\n)\n,\n\u03a3\u00afa =\n(\u2212 \u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3,\u2212\u03b72, i\u03b7\u00af2,\u2212\u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1) , (A.17)\nand in their turn, the 4\u00d7 4-dimensional matrices \u03b7c and \u03b7\u00afc, c = 1, 2, 3, are \u2019t Hooft\u2019s eta symbols [2]:\n\u03b7\u00afcAB = \u03b7\nc\nAB = \u01ebcAB A,B \u2208 {1, 2, 3},\n\u03b7\u00afc4A = \u03b7\nc\nA4 = \u03b4cA, (A.18)\n\u03b7cAB = \u2212\u03b7cBA, \u03b7\u00afcAB = \u2212\u03b7\u00afcBA.\n206\nIn six-dimensional Minkowski space we can take (A.16) with\n\u03a3a =\n(\ni\u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3, \u03b72, i\u03b72, \u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1\n)\n,\n\u03a3\u00afa =\n(\u2212 i\u03b73, i\u03b7\u00af3,\u2212\u03b72, i\u03b7\u00af2,\u2212\u03b71, i\u03b7\u00af1) , (A.19)\nwith a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nThe following properties of the \u03a3-matrices are valid both in Euclidean and Minkowski space:\n\u03a3aAB\u03a3aCD = \u03a3\u00afaAB\u03a3\u00afaCD = 2\u01ebABCD\n\u03a3aAB\u03a3\u00afaCD = \u22122\u03b4AC\u03b4BD + 2\u03b4AD\u03b4BC .\n(A.20)\nA positive (negative) chirality Weyl spinor is written \u03c8A (\u03c8A), A = 1, 2, 3, 4. For consistency the\n\u03a3-matrices have indices \u03a3ABa and \u03a3\u00afaAB. In Euclidean space the Weyl spinors are complex while in\nMinkowski space they are pseudo-real. In the latter case when there are an even number of such\nspinors we can introduce the concept of a \u201csymplectic-real spinor\u201d \u03c8Ai , i = 1, . . . , 2p, satisfying the\npseudo-reality condition\n\u03c8Ai = i\u2126ij \u03b7\u00af\n1\nAB(\u03c8\nB\nj )\n\u2217 , (A.21)\nwhere \u2126ij is a (symplectic) matrix with \u2126\u2126\n\u2217 = \u22121[2p]\u00d7[2p].\nWe can easily build up a representation of Clifford algebras in higher dimensions from those in lower\ndimensions. Suppose, we have Clifford algebras in p and q dimensions with Euclidean space generators\n\u0393\n(p)\nn , n = 1, . . . , p, and \u0393\n(q)\na , a = 1, . . . , q. A representation of the Clifford algebra in p + q dimensions\ncan then be constructed by taking the products\n\u0393N =\n{\n\u0393(p)n \u2297 1,\u0393(p)p+1 \u2297 \u0393(q)a\n}\n, N = 1, . . . , p+ q . (A.22)\n207\nAppendix B: Complex Geometry and the Quotient Construction\nOur intention in this appendix is to introduce some basic properties of complex manifolds93 and\ndescribe the \u201cquotient construction\u201d.\nA complex manifold M admits a complex structure I, a linear map of the tangent space to itself,\nsatisfying I2 = \u22121, which is integrable. This latter property means that the torsion, or Neijenhuis\ntensor, vanishes, so for any two vectors X and Y\n[IX, IY ]\u2212 [X, Y ]\u2212 I[X, IY ]\u2212 I[IX, Y ] = 0 . (B.1)\nNecessarily M must be of even dimension, 2n. A Hermitian metric g on M is invariant under I, so\ng(IX, IY ) = g(X, Y ) , (B.2)\nfor any two tangent vectors X and Y . The fundamental 2-form \u03c9 is defined by\n\u03c9(X, Y ) = g(IX, Y ) . (B.3)\n(Notice that \u03c9 is anti-symmetric as a consequence of (B.2) and I2 = \u22121.) We will denote (real) local\ncoordinates on M by x\u00b5, \u00b5 = 1, . . . , 2n; however, a complex manifold always admits local holomorphic\ncoordinates (zi, z\u00afi), i = 1, . . . , n, for which\nI =\n(\ni\u03b4i j 0\n0 \u2212i\u03b4ij\n)\n. (B.4)\nIn this basis, the Hermitian metric and fundamental 2-form are\ng = gijdz\ni dz\u00afj , \u03c9 = igijdz\ni \u2227 dz\u00afj . (B.5)\nA Ka\u00a8hler manifold is one for which the fundamental 2-form is closed, in which case the latter is\ncalled the Ka\u00a8hler form. The closure of the Ka\u00a8hler form implies (and follows from) the complex structure\nI is covariantly constant\n\u2207\u00b5I = 0 , (B.6)\nwith respect to the Levi-Civita connection associated to g. In addition, in holomorphic coordinates,\nthe metric is given in terms of a Ka\u00a8hler potential K by\ngij =\n\u2202\n\u2202zi\n\u2202\n\u2202z\u00afj\nK . (B.7)\nAnother way to characterize a Ka\u00a8hler manifold is via its holonomy group. Generically, on a manifold of\ndimension 2n this would be O(2n); however, since parallel transport with the connection \u2207\u00b5 respects\nthe holomorphic structure (does not mix holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices) the holonomy of a\nKa\u00a8hler manifold is contained in the subgroup U(n) \u2282 O(2n).\n93We will use the term \u201cmanifold\u201d loosely to encompass spaces which are generically smooth but may have certain\nsingularities.\n208\nWe now proceed to define a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold. Such a space M admits three independent\ncomplex structures I(c), c = 1, 2, 3, (which we often represent as a three-vector ~I), satisfying the\nalgebra\nI\n(c)\nI\n(d) = \u2212\u03b4cd + \u01ebcdeI(e) , (B.8)\nwhich are covariantly constant with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of a metric g which is Hermi-\ntian (B.2) with respect to each of the ~I. There are three Ka\u00a8hler forms ~\u03c9 each related to the metric as in\n(B.3). The space M is necessarily 4n dimensional. As before, we will take x\u00b5, \u00b5 = 1, . . . , 4n, to be a set\nof real local coordinates for M. There are holomorphic coordinates with respect to each of the complex\nstructures, but generally there are no local coordinates which simultaneously represent the action of all\nthe ~I; consequently we will have to work in terms of non-coordinate bases. The tangent space TM of a\nhyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold admits the following Sp(n)\u00d7 SU(2) description. There is a vielbein hi\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5 and an\ninverse hi\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5. The composite index i\u03b1\u02d9, i = 1, . . . , 2n and \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2, manifests the fact that the vielbein\npicks out an Sp(n)\u00d7 SU(2) structure in TM.94 The metric takes the form\ng = hi\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5h\nj\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03bd\u2126ij\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9dx\n\u00b5 dx\u03bd . (B.9)\nHere, \u2126ij, i = 1, . . . , 2n, is an Sp(n) 2-form. The index \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2 is an SU(2) spinor index which can be\nraised and lowered in the usual way by the \u01eb tensor associated to SU(2) spinors (see Appendix A). The\ncomplex structures act on the SU(2) indices of the vielbeins in a simple way:\n(I(c) \u00b7 h)i\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5 = \u2212i~\u03c4 c\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9hi\u03b2\u02d9\u00b5 , (B.10)\nwhere \u03c4 c are the three Pauli matrices. Notice that the three complex structures can be rotated as a\nthree-vector under action of the SU(2), although this action is not generally an isometry of M. The\nthree Ka\u00a8hler forms corresponding to the three complex structures are\n~\u03c9 = i\u2126ij\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9~\u03c4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b3\u02d9h\ni\u03b2\u02d9\n\u00b5h\nj\u03b3\u02d9\n\u03bddx\n\u00b5 \u2227 dx\u03bd . (B.11)\nOn a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold, since the tangent space admits an Sp(n) \u00d7 SU(2) structure, one can\ndefine the notion of symplectic tangent vectors. These are quantities, likeMi, which carry Sp(n) indices\nonly and which have a symplectic inner product\n\u2126(M,N ) = \u2126ijMiN j . (B.12)\nFor a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold the SU(2) part of the spin connection \u03c9\u00b5\ni\u03b1\u02d9\nj\u03b2\u02d9 (not to be confused with the\nKa\u00a8hler forms) vanishes. This means\n\u03c9\u00b5\ni\u03b1\u02d9\nj\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03c9\u00b5\ni\nj\u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9 . (B.13)\nThe tensor \u2126ij is covariantly constant with respect to the Sp(n) part of the connection. Similarly, the\nonly non-vanishing components of the Riemann tensor are\nRi\u03b1\u02d9 j\u03b2\u02d9 k\u03b3\u02d9 l\u03b4\u02d9 = Rijkl\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b3\u02d9\u03b4\u02d9 . (B.14)\nThis is a symptom of the fact that the holonomy group of a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler manifold is restricted to\nSp(n) \u2282 U(2n) \u2282 O(4n). The Sp(n) curvature Rijkl is a totally symmetric tensor in all its indices.\n94The group Sp(n), which has rank n, is often denoted as USp(2n).\n209\nAfter the brief introduction to complex geometry and, in particular, hyper-Ka\u00a8hler spaces, let us now\nturn to a way of constructing such spaces known as the quotient construction. We begin, initially, with\nthe simpler Ka\u00a8hler case. The quotient construction is a way of constructing a Ka\u00a8hler manifold M in\nterms of some larger dimensional Ka\u00a8hler manifold, the \u201cmother\u201d space, M\u02dc which admits some group of\nisometries G which preserves both the metric and complex structure. We will be interested in the case\nwhen G is some compact Lie group and we will denote the Hermitian generators T r, r = 1, . . . , dimG.95\nEach generator T r of G defines a vector field Xr over M\u02dc in the usual way. Since the group action\npreserves the metric and complex structure the Lie derivatives LXr I\u02dc = LXr g\u02dc = 0. This implies that Xr\nis a holomorphic Killing vector . The two conditions imply a third; namely, LXr\u03c9\u02dc = 0. Since\nLXr \u03c9\u02dc = \u0131Xrd\u03c9\u02dc + d(\u0131Xr \u03c9\u02dc) \u2261 d(\u0131Xr \u03c9\u02dc) , (B.15)\nthere exits a Hamiltonian function \u00b5Xr where d\u00b5Xr = \u0131Xr \u03c9\u02dc.\n96 In fact this only defines \u00b5Xr up to\na constant which can be fixed, up to the abelian factors in G, by requiring that \u00b5X is equivariant :\nX\u00b5Y = \u00b5[X,Y ]. In this case, the Hamiltonians are known as moment maps . As T r varies in the Lie\nalgebra of G we can define the function \u00b5 from M\u02dc to the Lie algebra\n\u00b5 =\ndimG\u2211\nr=1\n\u00b5XrT r . (B.16)\nThe Ka\u00a8hler quotient is then\nM = \u00b5\u22121(0)\/G , (B.17)\nin other words the quotient of the subspace N \u2282 M\u02dc on which the moment map vanishes, the so-called\nlevel set , by the group G. The daughter M is of dimension\ndimM = dim M\u02dc\u2212 2 dimG (B.18)\nand inherits a complex structure, metric and connection from M\u02dc. In order for the quotient to be well\ndefined, we require that G, at least generically, acts freely on M\u02dc. There may be points at which the\naction fails to be free, in which case there will be orbifold-type singularities in the quotient. Since,\ng\u02dc(I\u02dcXr, Xs) = \u03c9\u02dc(Xr, Xs) = \u2212\u3008Xr, d\u00b5Xs\u3009 = \u2212\u00b5[Xr,Xs] = 0 , (B.19)\nusing the equivariance property, a basis for the vectors in the tangent space normal to the level set is\ngiven by I\u02dcXr, r = 1, . . . , dimG.\nBefore we discuss the induced metric, complex structure and connection, let us say a little more\nabout the G-quotient part of the construction. It is useful to think of N as a principal G-bundle over\nthe quotient M = N\/G. Hence there is a projection p : N \u2192 M. The G-action picks out a subspace\nof V \u2282 TN called the vertical space spanned by the vector fields Xr. The tangent space TM is then\nidentified with the quotient vector space TN\/V. Let the horizontal space, H \u2282 TN be the subspace of\nvectors orthogonal to V, i.e. g\u02dc(X,Xr) = 0 for all r, so that\nTN = H \u2295 V . (B.20)\n95We will take an inner product on the Lie algebra of G with TrT rT s = \u03b4rs in some matrix representation.\n96This reasoning assumes that the first cohomology group H1(M\u02dc,R) is trivial.\n210\nA tangent vector X \u2208 TM has a unique horizontal lift to H (which by a slight abuse of notation we\ndenote with the same letter). From these definition it follows that a vector X \u2208 H \u2282 TM\u02dc satisfies\ng\u02dc(X, I\u02dcXr) = g\u02dc(X,Xr) = 0 . (B.21)\nThe complex structure I\u02dc in the mother space naturally induces one in the daughter. To see this it is\nenough to notice from (B.21) that I\u02dc preserves H. Consequently, the lift of I is simply equal to I\u02dc acting\non H and the integrability condition (B.1) is automatically satisfied. The induced Riemannian metric\non M is obtained in a analogous way. For two vectors X, Y \u2208 TM (with lifts to H denoted by the same\nletter), g(X, Y ) = g\u02dc(X, Y ). Finally a Levi-Civita connection \u2207\u02dc on M\u02dc induces such a connection \u2207 on\nthe daughter in the following way. First of all, the projection of the connection \u2207\u02dc to the tangent space\nTN \u2282 TM\u02dc defines a connection on N. It is easy to prove that the connection on N is of Levi-Civita\ntype. This is then identified with the pull-back of the Levi-Civita connection \u2207 on M to N, under the\nprojection p.\nOf particular importance for the instanton calculus is the volume form induced on the daughter\nspace (in the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler case discussed below). It will be convenient for applications to the instanton\ncalculus to define a volume form which, using physicists\u2019 language, is not gauge fixed. This means a\nG-invariant volume form \u03c9 on the level set N divided by the volume of the G-orbit at that point. A\nbone-fide volume form on M could then be obtained by a gauge fixing procedure, but we shall not\nnecessarily need to perform this operation. From what we have said above, it is straightforward to see\nthat the volume form we are after is\u222b\nM\n\u03c9\ndef\n=\n\u222b\nM\u02dc\n\u03c9\u02dc\nJ(x)\nVolG(x)\ndimG\u220f\nr=1\n\u03b4(\u00b5Xr) . (B.22)\nHere, \u03c9\u02dc is the canonical volume form on M, VolG(x) is the volume of the G-orbit through a point\nx \u2208 M\u02dc and J(x) is a Jacobian factor that arises when the integral over M\u02dc is restricted to N by the\nexplicit \u03b4-functions. Geometrically, J(x) is the square root of the determinant of the matrix of inner\nproducts of the normal vectors to the level set. Since a basis of such vectors is provided by I\u02dcXr, the\nJacobian is simply\nJ(x) =\n\u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u22231\/2 , (B.23)\nwhere L is the dimG\u00d7 dimG matrix of inner products with elements\nLrs \u2261 g\u02dc(I\u02dcXr, I\u02dcXs) = g\u02dc(Xr, Xs) , (B.24)\nSince G generically acts freely on M\u02dc, each orbit is, up to a scale factor, a copy of G itself. Hence, the\nvolume of the orbit through a point on the level set is\nVolG(x) =\n\u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u22231\/2 VolG , (B.25)\nHere, VolG a constant, the volume of the group in some canonical normalization. Notice that the\nfactors of the determinant of L cancel to leave\u222b\nM\n\u03c9 =\n1\nVolG\n\u222b\nM\u02dc\n\u03c9\u02dc\ndimG\u220f\nr=1\n\u03b4(\u00b5Xr) . (B.26)\n211\nThe hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction is an obvious generalization of the Ka\u00a8hler quotient con-\nstruction described above. One starts with a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space M\u02dc admitting a group action G which\npreserves the metric and three complex structures. The isometries correspond to vector fields which\nare tri-holomorphic Killing vectors, that is (i) holomorphic with respect to each of the three complex\nstructures LX\u03c9\u02dc(c) = 0 and (ii) preserving the metric LX g\u02dc = 0. Associated to each complex structure\nand Ka\u00a8hler form there is a moment map, defined as in the Ka\u00a8hler case above, which we can assembled\ninto the triplet ~\u00b5. In an identical way to the Ka\u00a8hler case, one can prove that the quotient\nM = ~\u00b5\u22121(0)\/G (B.27)\nis a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler space of dimension dim M\u02dc \u2212 4 dimG. In the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler case, a basis of vectors\nnormal to the level set is provided by the 3 dimG vectors I\u02dc\n(c)\nXr. As in the, Ka\u00a8hler case a natural\nmetric g(X, Y ) is induced on M by taking g\u02dc(X, Y ), with X and Y (denoted by the same symbol) being\nthe unique lifts of X and Y to H. The local condition for a vector X \u2208 TM\u02dc to be in H is\ng\u02dc(X, I\u02dc\n(c)\nXr) = g\u02dc(X,Xr) = 0 , (B.28)\ngeneralizing (B.21). In the SU(2)\u00d7 Sp(n) basis this condition is X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9X j\u02dc\u03b3\u02d9r ~\u03c4 \u03b2\u02d9 \u03b3\u02d9 = X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9X j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9r = 0,\nor equivalently\nX i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX\nj\u03b2\u02d9\nr = 0 . (B.29)\nThe fact that the SU(2) indices of the tangent vector are un-summed, allows us to identify symplectic\ntangent vectors to the quotient space. Their lifts are simply symplectic tangent vectors of M\u02dc subject\nto the projection (B.29):\nMi\u02dc\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dcX j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9r = 0 . (B.30)\nOf particular importance to the instanton calculus is the volume form on the quotient space, gener-\nalizing the expression (B.26) in the Ka\u00a8hler case. The Jacobian factor is, as before, the determinant of\nthe matrix of inner products of the basis vectors I\u02dc\n(c)\nXr normal to the level set. We have,\ng\u02dc(I\u02dc\n(c)\nXr, I\u02dc\n(d)\nXs) = \u03b4\ncdg\u02dc(Xr, Xs)\u2212 \u01ebcdeg\u02dc(Xr, I\u02dc(e)Xs) =\n{\ng\u02dc(Xr, Xs) c = d ,\n0 c 6= d , (B.31)\nwhere we have used (B.19). This means that\nJ(x) =\n\u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u22233\/2 , (B.32)\nwhere the matrix L is defined in (B.24). As previously the volume of the gauge orbit through a point\nof the level set is (B.25). Hence the G-invariant volume form is\u222b\nM\n\u03c9 =\n1\nVolG\n\u222b\nM\u02dc\n\u03c9\u02dc\n\u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u2223 dimG\u220f\nr=1\n3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4(\u00b5(c)Xr) . (B.33)\nNote the factor of |detL| as compared with the case of the Ka\u00a8hler quotient (B.26).\nAs an example of hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient construction which is directly relevant to the ADHM con-\nstruction, let us start from flat Euclidean space M\u02dc = R4n. In this case there are local coordinates z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\nfor which the one forms hi\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 = dz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9. The symplectic matrix is simply\n\u2126\u02dc =\n(\n0 1[n]\u00d7[n]\n\u22121[n]\u00d7[n] 0\n)\n. (B.34)\n212\nand the flat metric is\ng\u02dc = 4\u03c02\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9dz\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 dz j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 . (B.35)\nIn this case, there exists a hyper-Ka\u00a8hler potential\n\u03c7 = \u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9z\ni\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9z j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 . (B.36)\nWe now consider the hyper-Ka\u00a8hler quotient of R4n by some compact group G of tri-holomorphic\nisometries. The most general isometries of this type are generated by the vector fields\nXr = iT\nr\ni\u02dc j\u02dc\nz j\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202\n\u2202z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\n, (B.37)\nwhere T r generators in some 2n-dimensional representation of G which satisfies\n(\u2126\u02dcT r)t = \u2126\u02dcT r . (B.38)\nThe moment maps are\n~\u00b5Xr = \u2212 i\n2\nz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(\u2126\u02dcT r)\u02dci j\u02dcz\nj\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b3\u02d9~\u03c4\n\u03b3\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9 \u2212 ~\u03b6r , (B.39)\nwhere\n\u2211 ~\u03b6rT r, are arbitrary constant elements in the abelian component of the Lie algebra of G.\nThe (gauge un-fixed) volume form on the quotient follows from the general formula (B.33):\u222b\nM\n\u03c9 =\n1\nVolG\n\u222b { \u220f\n\u03b1\u02d9=1,2\n2n\u220f\ni\u02dc=1\ndz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\n} \u2223\u2223detL\u2223\u2223 dimG\u220f\nr=1\n3\u220f\nc=1\n\u03b4\n(\ni\n2\nz i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(\u2126\u02dcT r )\u02dci j\u02dcz\nj\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b3\u02d9\u03c4\nc\u03b3\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9 \u2212 ~\u03b6r\u00b5(c)Xr\n)\n, (B.40)\nwhere, as previously,\nLrs = g\u02dc(Xr, Xs) = \u2212\u2126\u02dci\u02dc j\u02dc\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9T ri\u02dc k\u02dczk\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9T sj\u02dc l\u02dcz l\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 . (B.41)\nFor this example, we now discuss more concretely the connection on the quotient and find an\nexplicit expression for the Riemann tensor. First the connection. As we have explained previously, the\nprescription is simple: lift tangent vectors to M to H (denoted by the same symbol). The Levi-Civita\nconnection is then obtained by projection to H from that on M\u02dc. Locally, the tangent space of the\nhorizontal subspace consists of vectors X that are orthogonal to the 4 dimG vectors {Xr, I\u02dc(c)Xr}, the\nconditions (B.28); hence, for two vectors X, Y \u2208 TM(\u2243 H)\n\u2207XY =\n(\u2207\u02dcXY )\u2016 = \u2207\u02dcXY \u2212 (\u2207\u02dcXY )\u22a5 , (B.42)\nwhere (\u2207\u02dcXY )\u22a5 =\u2211\nrs\nL\n\u22121\nrs\n{\ng\u02dc(\u2207\u02dcXY,Xs)Xr +\n3\u2211\nc=1\ng(\u2207\u02dcXY, I\u02dc(c)Xs)I\u02dc(c)Xr\n}\n. (B.43)\nWe can make the inner product more explicit by using (\u2207\u02dcXY )i\u03b1\u02d9 = X j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\u2202Y i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9\/\u2202z j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9 and the expression\nfor Xr in (B.37)\ng\u02dc(\u2207\u02dcXY,Xr) = \u2212iX i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(\u2126\u02dcT r )\u02dci j\u02dcY j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b2\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9 ,\ng\u02dc(\u2207\u02dcXY, I\u02dc(c)Xr) = \u2212X i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9(\u2126\u02dcT r )\u02dci j\u02dcY j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b2\u02d9\u03b3\u02d9\u03c4 c\u03b3\u02d9 \u03b1\u02d9 .\n(B.44)\n213\nIn deriving these expressions we used the facts g\u02dc(Y,Xr) = g\u02dc(Y, I\n(c)Xr) = 0 and, from (B.38), \u2126\u02dcT\nr is a\nsymmetric matrix.\nThe Riemann tensor of M can be expressed using the standard formula in terms of the lifts\nW,X, Y, Z \u2208 H:\nR(X, Y,W,Z) = g\u02dc\n(\nW, \u2207\u02dcX(\u2207\u02dcY Z)\u2016 \u2212 \u2207\u02dcY (\u2207\u02dcXZ)\u2016 \u2212 \u2207\u02dc[X,Y ]\u2016Z\n)\n= g\u02dc\n(\nW, \u2207\u02dcX(\u2207\u02dcYZ)\u2016 \u2212 \u2207\u02dcY (\u2207\u02dcXZ)\u2016 \u2212 \u2207\u02dcZ(\u2207\u02dcXY )\u2016 + \u2207\u02dcZ(\u2207\u02dcYX)\u2016 \u2212 [Z, [X, Y ]]\n)\n.\n(B.45)\nNotice that some of the projections are unnecessary here, since W \u2208 H and [Z,K] \u2208 V for any K \u2208 V.\nUsing the fact that g\u02dc(W, \u2207\u02dcX(\u2207\u02dcY Z)\u22a5) = \u2212g\u02dc(\u2207\u02dcXW, (\u2207\u02dcY Z)\u22a5) we can write (B.45) as\nR(X, Y,W,Z) =R\u02dc(X, Y,W,Z) + g\u02dc\n(\n(\u2207\u02dcXZ)\u22a5, (\u2207\u02dcYW )\u22a5\n)\u2212 g\u02dc((\u2207\u02dcXW )\u22a5, (\u2207\u02dcYZ)\u22a5)\n\u2212 g\u02dc((\u2207\u02dcXY )\u22a5, (\u2207\u02dcWZ)\u22a5)+ g\u02dc((\u2207\u02dcYX)\u22a5, (\u2207\u02dcWZ)\u22a5) , (B.46)\nwhere R\u02dc is the Riemann tensor of M\u02dc. In the example relevant to the ADHM construction this vanishes\nsince the mother space is flat.\nWe now extract the components of the Riemann tensor in the z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9 basis by choosing X = \u2202\/\u2202z i\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9,\nY = \u2202\/\u2202z j\u02dc\u03b2\u02d9, W = \u2202\/\u2202zk\u02dc\u03b3\u02d9 and Z = \u2202\/\u2202z l\u02dc\u03b4\u02d9. One finds\nRi\u02dc\u03b1\u02d9,\u02dcj\u03b2\u02d9,k\u02dc\u03b3\u02d9,\u02dcl\u03b4\u02d9\n= 2\u01eb\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\u01eb\u03b3\u02d9\u03b4\u02d9\n\u2211\nrs\n{\n(\u2126\u02dcT r)\u02dci j\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)k\u02dc l\u02dc + (\u2126\u02dcT\nr )\u02dci l\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)\u02dcj k\u02dc + (\u2126\u02dcT\nr)\u02dci k\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)\u02dcj l\u02dc\n}\n. (B.47)\nThis forms reflects the decomposition of the Riemann tensor in (B.14) and so we can extract the\nsymplectic curvature of the quotient:\nRi\u02dc j\u02dc k\u02dc l\u02dc = 2\n\u2211\nrs\n{\n(\u2126\u02dcT r )\u02dci j\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)k\u02dc l\u02dc + (\u2126\u02dcT\nr )\u02dci l\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)\u02dcj k\u02dc + (\u2126\u02dcT\nr)\u02dci k\u02dcL\n\u22121\nrs (\u2126\u02dcT\ns)\u02dcj l\u02dc\n}\n. (B.48)\nSince, from Eq. (B.38), \u2126\u02dcT r is a symmetric matrix, it is apparent that the symplectic curvature is\ntotally symmetric in all its indices.\n214\nAppendix C: ADHM Algebra\nIn this appendix, we collect together most the pieces of ADHM algebra that we need in the text.\nPerforming ADHM algebra is rather an art, requiring a good deal of chicanery and experience. The\nADHM constraints and identities (2.50), (2.55), (2.61), (4.30) and (4.31b):\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u03b2\u02d9 = \u03b4\n\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b2\u02d9f\n\u22121 , \u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u00af\u03b1 = b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 , b\u00af\u03b1b\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b21[k]\u00d7[k]\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9M+ M\u00af\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 = 0 , M\u00afb\u03b1 = b\u00af\u03b1M (C.1)\nare used pervasively. The following differentiation formulae which are proved using the definitions (2.50)\nand (2.51), are particularly useful:\n\u2202nf = \u2212f\u2202n(12\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u03b1\u02d9)f =\n{\n\u2212f\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\n\u2212f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9f\n(C.2a)\n\u0003f = \u22124f b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f , (C.2b)\n\u2202nP = \u2212\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n b\u00af\u03b1P \u2212 Pb\u03b1\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , (C.2c)\n\u0003P = \u22124{P, b\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b1}+ 4\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 . (C.2d)\nTo complete this compendium of differentiation formulae, using the expression for the gauge potential\n(2.49) and the ADHM identity (2.47) along with (C.1), for any J (x), we have\nDn(U\u00afJU) = \u2202n(U\u00afJU) + [An, U\u00afJU ]\n= U\u00af \u2202nJ U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9JU \u2212 U\u00afJ\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n b\u00af\u03b1U , (C.3a)\nD2(U\u00afJU) = \u22124U\u00af{b\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b1,J}U + 4U\u00afb\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9J\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1U\n+ U\u00af\u22022JU \u2212 2U\u00afb\u03b1f\u03c3n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2202nJU \u2212 2U\u00af\u2202nJ\u2206\u03b1\u02d9\u03c3\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1n f b\u00af\u03b1U . (C.3b)\nFinally, there are various other tricks that we will explain in situ; however, there are particularly\nuseful ones involving quantities of the form\nJ =\n(\nB[N]\u00d7[N] 0[N]\u00d7[2k]\n0[2k]\u00d7[N] C[k]\u00d7[k]1[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\n. (C.4)\nThe pair of identities is\n\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9JU = (a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9J \u2212 Ca\u03b1\u02d9)U , U\u00afJ\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 = U\u00af(J a\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u03b1\u02d9C) . (C.5)\nThe first of these is proved by expanding \u2206\u00af = a\u00af+ x\u00afb\u00af, as in (2.45). Then with b\u00af assuming the canonical\nform (2.57) we can commute x\u00afb\u00af it through J , picking out the component C, and then use to (2.47) to\nre-write x\u00afb\u00afU = \u2212a\u00afU . The other identity is proved in a similar way.\nNote that where possible we suppress indices. However, in most situations the spinor indices \u03b1 and\n\u03b1\u02d9 need to be written explicitly because they are often not contracted in an obvious way.\nOsborn\u2019s formula\n215\nThis identity reads [8]\ntrN F\n2\nmn = \u2212g\u22122\u00032 trk log f .

(C.7)\nNow the right-hand side. Firstly,\n\u0003 trk log f = trk\n(\nf\u22121\u0003f \u2212 f\u22121 \u2202nf f\u22121 \u2202nf\n)\n= \u22122trk\n(\nb\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f + 2f\n)\n,\n(C.8)\nusing the differentiation formulae (C.2a) and (C.2b) along with the expression for P in (2.51). Then\nemploying the differentiation formulae (C.2a)-(C.2d) once again\n\u00032 trk log f = 8trk\n(\nb\u00af\u03b1{P, b\u03b2f b\u00af\u03b2}b\u03b1f \u2212 b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b2Pb\u03b2f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1f\n\u2212 b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b2Pb\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b2f \u2212 b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b2f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b2\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\n+ b\u00af+\u03b1Pb\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b2Pb\u03b2f + 2f b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f\n)\n.\n(C.9)\nThen using the ADHM identity (2.55), the definition of P in (2.51) along with (2.61), this becomes\n\u00032 trk log f = 16trk\n(\nb\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b2f b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f + b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1f b\u00af\u03b2Pb\u03b2f\n)\n, (C.10)\nprecisely \u2212g2 times (C.7).\nZero modes\nWe prove that the quantity\n\u039b\u03b1(C) \u2261 U\u00afCf b\u00af\u03b1U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1fC\u00afU (C.11)\nsatisfies the zero mode condition\nD\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1\u039b\u03b1(C) = 0 .

From the final rewrite in Eq. (C.24), the desired result (C.22) follows by inspection upon anti-\nsymmetrization in C and C \u2032.\nCovariant Laplace equation with bi-fermion source\nWe now prove that for an adjoint-valued scalar field the solution of the covariant Laplace equation\nwith a bi-fermion source:\nD2\u03c6 = \u039b(C)\u039b(C \u2032) (C.25)\nand boundary condition limx\u2192\u221e \u03c6(x) = \u03c60, is\n\u03c6 = \u22121\n4\nU\u00afCfC\u00af \u2032U + U\u00af\n(\n\u03c60 0\n0 \u03d51[2]\u00d7[2]\n)\nU , (C.26)\nwhere\n\u03d5 = L\u22121\n(\nw\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9 +\n1\n4\nC\u00afC \u2032\n)\n. (C.27)\nis a k \u00d7 k matrix.\nFirst of all, using the asymptotic formulae (2.105) it is easy to see that (C.26) has the correct\nboundary condition at infinity. Next we employ the differentiation formula (C.3b) with J = 1\n4\nCfC\u00af \u2032\nand compare with\n\u039b(C)\u039b(C \u2032) = \u2212U\u00afCf b\u00af\u03b1PC \u2032f b\u00af\u03b1U + U\u00afCf b\u00af\u03b1Pb\u03b1fC\u00af \u2032U\n+ U\u00afb\u03b1fC\u00afPC \u2032f b\u00af\u03b1U \u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1fC\u00afPb\u03b1fC\u00af \u2032U .\n(C.28)\nUsing the differentiation formula (C.2b) we find that the 3rd term in (C.3b) matches the 2nd term in\n(C.28). Then writing P = 1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 in the 1st and 4th terms of (C.28) and using Eqs. (C.14) and\n(C.15), \u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9C = \u2212C\u00af\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 and b\u00af\u03b1C = C\u00afb\u03b1, and the differentiation formula (C.2a), we find that these terms\nmatch the 1st, 4th and 5th terms in (C.3b). This leaves the 3nd term in (C.28) which matches the 2rd\nterm in (C.3b) apart from the fact that P is replaced by P \u2212 1. Hence\nD2(1\n4\nU\u00afCfC\u00af \u2032U) = \u039b(C)\u039b(C \u2032)\u2212 U\u00afb\u03b1fC\u00afC \u2032f b\u00af\u03b1U .

Putting this together with (C.29) we have solved (C.25) if\nL\u03d5 = w\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03c60w\u03b1\u02d9 +\n1\n4\nC\u00afC \u2032 .

(C.34)\nHere, \u03c6a is the solution to (C.25) given in (C.26). The collective coordinate matrix NA (which will be\nseen to depend in a nontrivial way on the original collective coordinates {a,MA}) is subject to the\nusual zero mode conditions (4.31a)-(4.31b).\nWe now solve (C.34) for \u03c8\u00af\u03b1\u02d9A and NA.

By inspection, we confirm the ansa\u00a8tze (C.38), where the Grassmann zero mode matrix has\n220\nthe form\nNA = \u2212\u03a3\u00afaAB\n[ (\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\nMB \u2212MB\u03d5a\n]\n+ 2\n(\n0 0\n0 G\u03b1\u02d9A\n)\na\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 2a\u03b1\u02d9G\u03b1\u02d9A . (C.44)\nUp till this point we have yet to solve for G\u03b1\u02d9A. This is accomplished by inserting NA into the fermionic\nconstraints (4.31a)-(4.31b). One finds that Eq. (4.31b) is satisfied automatically by the expression\n(C.44). In contrast, Eq. (4.31a) amounts to 2k2 independent real linear constraints, which is precisely\nthe number required to fix the anti-Hermitian k \u00d7 k matrices G\u03b1\u02d9A completely (the explicit form for G\u03b1\u02d9A\nis not required).\nSupersymmetry transformations of the fermion zero modes\nFrom the supersymmetry transformation of the fermion zero modes\n\u03b4\u039b(MA) = \u2212i\u03a3ABa ( \/D\u03c6a)\u03be\u00afB , (C.45)\nand the expression (4.64) for \u03c6a in the instanton background, we now extract the transformation of the\nGrassmann collective coordinates\n\u03b4MA = 2i\u03a3ABa Ca\u03b1\u02d9\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9B , \u03b4M\u00afA = 2i\u03a3ABa \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9BC\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a , (C.46)\nwhere\nCa\u03b1\u02d9 =\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\na\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212 a\u03b1\u02d9\u03d5a , C\u00af\u03b1\u02d9a = a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\n\u2212 \u03d5aa\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 . (C.47)\nThe proof begins by expressing \u03b4\u03bb in terms of a variation of the c-number collective coordinates, as\nin (4.68), and a variation of the Grassmann collective coordinates that must be determined. Up to a\ngauge transformation, one finds\n\u03b4\u039b\u03b1(MA) = \u039b\u03b1(\u03b4M\u2032A) + i\u03be\u03b1\u02d9BU\u00af\n{\n\u2212MBf\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MAf b\u00af\u03b1 \u2212Mf b\u00af\u03b1\u2206\u03b1\u02d9fM\u00afB +MBf\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1fM\u00afA\n+ b\u03b1fM\u00afA\u2206\u03b1\u02d9fM\u00afB +MAfM\u00afB\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1 + b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MBfM\u00afA\n}\nU .\n(C.48)\nIn order to derive this we used\n\u03b4a\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03be\u03b1\u02d9AMA , \u03b4a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 = i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9AM\u00afA ,\n\u03b4U\u00af = \u2212(U\u00af\u03b4U)U\u00af \u2212 U\u00af\u03b4a\u03b1\u02d9f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9 , \u03b4U = U(U\u00af\u03b4U)\u2212\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f\u03b4a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9U ,\n\u03b4f = \u22121\n2\nf\n(\n\u03b4a\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2206\u03b1\u02d9 + \u2206\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b4a\u03b1\u02d9\n)\nf .\n(C.49)\nNotice that only the last term in (C.48) depends on the variation of the Grassmann collective coordi-\nnates.\nFrom the supersymmetry transformation rule, the right-hand side of (C.48) must be equated with\nthe right-hand side of (C.45) where \u03c6a assumes its value in the instanton background as in (4.64). Using\nthe derivative identity (C.3a) and properties of the \u03a3-matrices, one finds\n\u2212i\u03a3ABa \/D\u03c6a\u03be\u00afB =\u2212 i\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9BU\u00af\n{\nMAf\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1fM\u00afB + b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MAfM\u00afB +MAfM\u00afB\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1\n\u2212MBf\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9b\u03b1fM\u00afA \u2212 b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9MBfM\u00afA \u2212MBfM\u00afA\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1\n\u2212 2i\u03a3ABa b\u03b1f\u2206\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\n\u2212 2i\u03a3ABa\n(\n\u03c60a 0\n0 \u03d5a\n)\n\u2206\u03b1\u02d9f b\u00af\u03b1\n}\nU .\n(C.50)\n221\nOne can verify using the fermionic ADHM constraints (4.34) that the first six terms in the above are\nequal to the first six terms in (C.48). This means that the variation \u039b\u03b1(\u03b4MA) is then equated with\nthe final two terms in (C.50). These terms are not quite in the right form due to the presence of the\nx-dependent \u2206 and \u2206\u00af terms. However, this can easily be removed by using the tricks (C.5). When this\nhas been done one extracts the variations of the Grassmann collective coordinates given in (4.70).\nVariation of the fermion zero modes\nWe now prove that under a variation by a collective coordinate X\u00b5\n\u2202\u039b(M)\n\u2202X\u00b5\n+ [\u2126\u00b5,\u039b(M)] = \/D \u00af\u033a\u00b5 + \u039b\n(\n\u2202M\/\u2202X\u00b5), (C.51)\nwhere\n\u00af\u033a\u03b1\u02d9\u00b5 =\n1\n4\nU\u00af\n\u2202a\u03b1\u02d9\n\u2202X\u00b5\nfM\u00afU .
