Alcohol \nabuse and dependence have been recognised as significant health issues for many years. \nIrresponsible and excessive consumption can produce damaging health consequences at \ngreat cost to the individual, their family and society (Ford, Hawkes & Elliott, 2008).  \nThe growth of excessive alcohol consumption, where drinking large quantities \nbecomes an end in itself, is a worrying trend. This type of alcohol consumption is often \nassociated with outbreaks of antisocial behaviour among young people and can have \nserious and damaging health consequences for those who allow their drinking to excess \nto continue over extended periods of time (Wyllie, Millard & Zhang, 1996; Richardson & \nBudd, 2003; Matthews, Shepherd & Sivarajasingham, 2006). Although drunkenness \noccurs across all age groups, it is most commonplace among young people in their mid to \nlate teens (Alcohol Concern, 2003). \nHow to tackle this social problem has posed a major challenge to government. \nEmpirical research has identified a range of potential influences on the onset of youth \ndrinking including parents and peer groups (Adlaf & Kohn, 1989; Houghton & Roche, \n2001; Smart, 1988). Other evidence identified alcohol advertising as an important factor. \nThere is certainly empirical evidence in support of the alleged influences of alcohol \nadvertising (Aitken, Eadie, Leathar, McNeill, & Scott 1988; Aitken, 1989; Young, 2003). \nExposure to televised advertising could raise brand awareness and the latter in turn was \nlinked to future drinking (Lipsitz, Brake, Vincent & Winters, 1993).  \nChildren themselves have been found to believe that alcohol advertising can cause \nalcohol consumption (Lieberman & Orlandi, 1987; Wyllie et al., 1989, 1998). Through \nraising young people\u2019s awareness and familiarity with alcohol, advertising is a \ncontributor towards their decision eventually to take up drinking (Hastings, Anderson, \nCooke & Gordon, 2005). Liking of alcohol advertisements has been significantly linked \nto drinking alcohol among young adults in multi-variate statistical tests that took into \naccount other potential causal factors such as parent and peer variables (Wyllie et al., \n1998).  \n 4 \nEvidence that has linked alcohol consumption among young directly to advertising \nexposure has derived from surveys (Atkin, Neuendorf & McDermott, 1983; Connolly, \nCasswell, Zhang & Silva, 1994; Robinson, Chen & Killen, 1998; Wyllie, Zhang & \nCasswell, 1998) and experiments (e.g., McCarty & Ewing, 1983; Kohn & Smart, 1984; \nSobell et al., 1986; Lipsitz, Brake, Vincent and Winters, 1993). Surveys can be further \ndivided into those that have obtained data from respondents at one point in time (e.g., \nUnger, Schuster, Zogg, Dent & Stacy, 2003) versus those that have obtained data from \nthe same respondents on more than one occasion (e.g., Stacey, Zogg, Unger & Dent, \n2004; Ellickson, et al., 2005). \n   Most of the research that has attempted to demonstrate relationships between \nalcohol advertising exposure and consumption has been conducted in the \u2018field\u2019 among \nlarge samples of young people and has been dependent upon their self-reports about their \nbehaviour. Such studies use survey methodology to determine whether reported exposure \nto alcohol advertising is correlated with or predictive of alcohol consumption.  \nSome experimental studies conducted in laboratory conditions  have indicated that \nshowing televised alcohol advertisements to individuals can raise their short-term interest \nin alcohol consumption as tested virtually immediately after advertising exposure, when \nalcohol is made available, compared to matched individuals who were not exposed to any \nalcohol advertising (e.g., Kohn & Smart, 1984). Others failed to reproduce similar \nfindings (e.g., Kohn & Smart, 1987; Sobell et al., 1986). None of these investigations \nrevealed anything about the role advertising might play in the genesis of alcohol \nconsumption in individuals. Exposure to televised alcohol advertising has also been \nfound to produce a decrease in the confidence of heavy drinkers that they could resist \ndrinking heavily again in the future (Sobell, Sobell, Toneatto, & Leo, 1993). \nSome cross-sectional surveys have reported significant statistical associations \nbetween reported alcohol advertising exposure and alcohol consumption (Atkin & Block, \n1984; Atkin, Neuendorf & McDermott, 1983; Robinson et al., 1998) or between liking of \nalcohol adverts and alcohol consumption (Wyllie et al., 1998). Longitudinal surveys have \nalso indicated links between self-reports of advertising exposure and alcohol \nconsumption among young people (Connolly et al., 1994; Ellickson et al., 2005).  \n 5 \nLongitudinal survey research conducted in New Zealand reported that the more \nmale teenagers were able to recall beer advertisements at the age of 15 years, the more \nthey drank at 18 years. This finding occurred only for beer drinking and not for \nconsumption of wine or spirits. The advertising recall effect only had a modest effect \neven in the case of beer drinking (Connolly, Casswell, Zhang & Silva, 1994). This \nfinding was reinforced in further longitudinal research that followed through 18 year olds \nuntil the age of 21 years which found that earlier liking of televised alcohol \nadvertisements and associated brand allegiance were associated with greater volume of \nbeer consumption later on (Casswell & Zhang, 1998). The reasons why beer advertising \nproved to be most potent in this research is not fully explained. There may have been \ndifferences in the extent to which beer advertising campaigns were run in the major mass \nmedia as compared to campaigns for other alcohol products. There may have been \ndifferences in production treatments that rendered beer advertisements more attention-\ngrabbing. Focus group interviews with children and teenagers have indicated that they \noften display liking of beer advertisements (Nash, 2002). Of course, liking of alcohol \nadvertisements or even associations between liking and reported liking or consumption of \nalcohol products even in large-scale surveys do not demonstrate causal relationships \nbetween advertising and consumption (Young, 2003).     \nResearch among Californian teenagers indicated that liking of advertisements, \nbrand recall and receptivity to alcohol marketing predicted alcohol use. The findings \nsuggested that exposure to alcohol advertising could produce favourable opinions about \nalcohol among young people and that this may in turn increase their likelihood of future \nconsumption (Unger, Schuster, Zogg, Dent & Stacy, 2003). A further US study of 13 to \n14 year-olds found that increased exposure to alcohol advertisements on television in the \nfirst year of the study was associated with greater likelihood of consuming beer or wine a \nyear later (Stacy, Zogg, Unger & Dent, 2004). \nResearch conducted over time among over 3,000 American youth aged 12 to 15 \nyears in which they were asked questions designed to track their alcohol consumption \nbehaviour, exposure to different kinds of alcohol advertising and other social factors \nlinked to drinking. Research with US 13 to 15 year-olds who were questioned three times \nover three years reported that for drinkers and non-drinkers in year 1, greater exposure to \n 6 \nalcohol advertising in year 2 made it more likely that teenagers would drink alcohol in \nyear 3 (Ellickson, et al., 2005). \nThis paper reports a new survey-based study of antecedents of alcohol drinking \nbehaviour among young people in central-east England. Data were obtained about \nalcohol consumption, exposure to alcohol advertising and family and peer group drinking \nhabits and attitudes towards alcohol. A wider range of alcohol-related consumption and \nalcohol advertising exposure behaviours was examined in this study than in most other \npublished surveys that have investigated relationships between these classes of variables. \nAlthough, this research cannot demonstrate cause-effect relationships in any direct sense, \nit does attempt to show the strength of associative links specifically between reported \nexposure to alcohol advertising in different media and reported alcohol consumption, in \nthe presence of simultaneous statistical controls for other social factors, such as parental \nand peer group influences.  \nIn addition to measuring self-reports of overall alcohol consumption and advertising \nexposure, respondents were questioned about their consumption of specific categories of \nalcoholic beverage (beers, cider, designer drinks, spirits, wines) and exposure to \nadvertising for brands representing each of those beverage types. In view of the \nconflicting evidence from earlier research, a number of research questions were \nconstructed rather than hypotheses about relationships between reported exposure to \nalcohol advertising and alcohol consumption. \nRQ1. Is greater reported exposure to alcohol advertising significantly related to \nreported frequency of alcohol consumption? There is previous evidence that affirms this \nlink (e.g., Lipsitz, Brake, Vincent & Winters, 1993; Stacey, et al., 2004) and disconfirms \nit (e.g., Strickland, 1981, 1982, 1983).  \nRQ2. Does reported exposure to alcohol advertising predict frequency of alcohol \nconsumption in the presence of controls for family and peer group variables? Research \namong teenagers in the United States has indicated that early exposure to alcohol \nadvertising predicted likelihood of alcohol consumption one or two years later, even \nwhen social factors such as parental and peer group drinking were statistically controlled \n(Ellickson et al., 2005). Research with college students, however, found no evidence that \n 7 \nexposure to televised advertising for alcohol produced increased interest in drinking beer \nimmediately afterwards (Sobell et al., 1986). \nRQ3. Are certain forms of media advertising of alcohol more powerfully related \nto alcohol consumption than others? Most studies of the impact of alcohol advertising \nhave focused on television advertising. One study, however, found that magazine \nadvertising and point-of-sale advertising displayed stronger relationships with alcohol \nconsumption propensity a year or two later than did other forms of advertising (Ellickson, \net al., 2005).  \nRQ4. Is consumption of some types of alcoholic beverage more significantly \nrelated to alcohol advertising exposure than others? Not all alcohol advertising impact \nstudies have differentiated between different types of alcoholic drink, but in those that \nhave, differences have emerged between types of product in terms of strength of \nrelationships between reported advertising exposure and alcohol consumption. Hence, \nbeer and wine consumption were found to be greater among US teenagers who reported \ngreater advertising exposure for these products, while this result did not emerge for other \ntypes of alcoholic drink (Stacey et al., 2004).    \nRQ5. Is alcohol consumption predicted similarly or differently by alcohol \nadvertising exposure among males and females? Both young women and young men \nhave been found to display greater interest in drinking alcohol after exposure to alcohol \nadvertising under controlled exposure conditions (Kohn & Smart, 1984; 1987). It is \nunclear, however, whether such effects are anything more than short-term and that they \nwear off soon after advertising exposure has taken place. Given continued concern about \nthe prevalence of alcohol consumption, including excessive consumption, among young \nwomen (Gill, Donaghy, Guise & Warner, 2007; MacRae, 2007), it is important to \nseparate the genders in examining relationships between alcohol consumption and \nreported exposure to alcohol advertising.       \n \nMethodology \nA self-completion questionnaire survey was conducted with young people aged 17 to 21 \nyears. Respondents were recruited from among university and further education college \npopulations in Leicester, UK. Respondents were volunteers accessed via class tutors. \n 8 \nMost questionnaires were completed at the end of class sessions, while some were \nreturned by respondents in their own time to an address provided. A researcher explained \nto respondents the purpose of the survey and gave clear assurances that all questionnaires \nwould be completed anonymously. Data could not therefore be traced back to specific \nrespondents. In consequence, respondents were invited to be as honest as possible in \ngiving their answers. \n  \nSample details \nThe total sample of 298 respondents comprised 169 university students and 129 \nsecondary school students of whom 60% were female and 40% were male.  The age \nrange was 17 to 23 years, with the following age breakdown: 17 years (10%), 18 years \n(29%), 19 years (34%), 20 years (15%) and 21+ years (12%). The sample comprised \nmainly white British students (41%). The second most prevalent ethnic group comprised \nstudents of Indian descent (28%), Black African (6%), Pakistani\/Bangladeshi (6%), Other \nAsian (6%), Other white (6%), other (7%).   \n \nThe Questionnaire \nYoung people\u2019s alcohol consumption was measured via a self-completion questionnaire \nsurvey which explored three principal areas: respondents\u2019 own consumption of alcoholic \nbeverages; reports of the alcohol consumption habits of people known to them; and \nreported exposure to advertising for alcoholic drinks.  \nThe measure of general consumption of alcohol comprised a self-report of how \nmany occasions they had had any alcoholic beverages to drink \u2018during past 30 days\u2019. \nResponses were given to a seven-point scale ranging from \u2018never\u2019 to \u201840+ times\u2019.  \nIn relation to different types of alcoholic drink, respondents were presented with a \nlist of alcohol brand names, covering beers, coders, spirits, wines and alcopops, and were \nasked to indicate in each case how often they had drunk it. A four-point scale was \nprovided: \u2018never\u2019, \u2018once or twice\u2019, \u2018a few times\u2019, \u2018a lot\u2019. Scores were aggregated across \nlisted brands in each drinks category to produce a single consumption score for each type \nof alcoholic drink.  \n 9 \nA further section of the questionnaire contained questions about media consumption \nand reported exposure to alcohol advertising. Respondents were asked to estimate the \nnumber of hours per week they watched television, which TV channels or services they \ncould receive and how often they watched TV after 9pm. Another question probed \nfrequencies of watching a number of different TV channels. Respondents were also asked \nhow often in the past six months they had been to the cinema. Finally, respondents were \ngiven a list of alcohol brands and asked them how often in the past six months they had \nseen advertising for any of these brands on television, at the cinema or in magazines. A \nfour-point frequency scale was used throughout: \u2018never\u2019, \u2018once or twice\u2019, \u20183-6 times\u2019 and \n\u20187+ times\u2019. The latter frequency scale was adopted to provide a standardized that could be \napplied to all three media. Given that cinema attendance was expected to be relatively \ninfrequent compared to television viewing, this measure was deemed appropriate for \nreported exposure to advertising in a cinema context. Pilot tests had indicated that \nrespondents similar to those used in the main survey expressed no difficulty with this \nquestion. Nevertheless, it must be seen as providing a very general indication of alcohol \nbrand advertising exposure.  \nA further set of questions explored with respondents the presence in their lives of \nother people who drank alcohol. Initial questions asked respondents to indicate the \nfrequency with which their father\/male guardian, mother\/female guardian and best friend \ndrink alcohol (\u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018only very occasionally\u2019, \u2018every week\u2019, \u2018every day\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t \nknow\u2019, \u2018do not have father\/mother\/guardian\/best friend\u2019). \nRespondents were then asked how often (\u2018never\u2019, \u2018once or twice\u2019, \u2018a few times\u2019, \n\u2018many times\u2019) their parents\/guardians had given them alcohol to drink at home. The same \nresponse scale was then used by respondents to estimate how often they had seen their \nparents\/guardian drunk after having had too much alcohol to drink.  \nThe social side of drinking was explored through questions that asked respondents \nhow often they met with friends in bars or clubs where alcohol is served, how many of \ntheir friends drink alcohol, and how many of their friends get drunk at least once a week. \nThey were also asked whether their parents or guardians know where they spend their \nSaturday nights and what parents reaction would be if they got drunk (\u2018would not allow \nit\u2019, \u2018would discourage it\u2019, \u2018would not mind\u2019, \u2018would approve of it\u2019). \n 10 \nPersonal details were also collected from respondents that included their gender, \nage, religion and ethnic group. \n \nResults \nDescriptive statistics about alcohol consumption are presented initially followed by the \nresults of series of analyses designed to identify predictors of frequency of alcohol \nconsumption and consumption of different types of alcohol.  \n \nConsumption of Alcohol Drinks \nIn the past month, one in three (34%) said they had drunk no alcohol, while 16% said \nthey had drunk 10 to 19 times in the last one month and only 8% said they had had \nalcohol 40+ times.  \nAgain, during the month leading up to the survey, 60% of respondents had \nreportedly consumed spirits, 46% spirits, 37% beer, 35% alcopops, and 21% cider.  \nFemales were more likely than males to have reportedly drunk spirits (57% versus 39%), \nwine (56% versus 35%), and alcopop (40% versus 31%). Males were more likely thane \nfemales to have drunk beer (40% versus 35%) and cider (29% versus 17%).   \n \nPredictors of Alcohol Consumption  \nIn order to identify potential factors that determine the drinking profile of respondents a \nseries of multiple regression analyses was conducted over data from the total sample. In \naddition, two further series of multiple regression analysis were conducted among male \nand female respondents. These analyses were computed in relation to [1] general alcohol \nconsumption and [2] consumption of beers, cider, spirits, wine and alcopops.   \n \n[1] General Alcohol Consumption  \nAnalyses of the overall alcohol consumption among respondents in the past month was \nthe key dependent variable measured on a seven-point scale (1 = \u2018never\u2019 and 7 = 40+ \ntimes). Predictor variables comprised demographic variables (gender and age); family-\nrelated variables (reported consumption of alcohol by father\/male guardian, \nmother\/female guardian, whether respondents were given alcohol by their parents, \nfrequency of seeing parents drunk, parents knowing respondent\u2019s whereabouts on \n 11 \nSaturday nights, parents\u2019 likely reaction to respondent getting drunk); peer group \nvariables (amount of alcohol consumption by best friend, number of friends who drink, \nfrequency of meeting friends in places where alcohol is served);  media consumption \nvariables (amount of TV viewing, TV viewing after 9pm);  and alcohol advertising \nexposure (on TV, at cinema and in magazines). All predictor variables were entered \ntogether. \nFor reported alcohol consumption over the \u2018last month\u2019, 64% of the variance was \naccounted for by the predictor variables (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.64), 68% of the \nvariance was accounted for by the predictor variables for the male respondents only \n(Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.68) and 62% for the female respondents (Adjusted \nMultiple R Square = 0.62).  \nTable 1: Predictors of Alcohol Consumption in Last Month \n \nPredictors  Beta T P < \nGender -.009 -.23 .82 \nAge .011 .28 .78 \nFather\/male guardian alcohol consumption  .001 .02 .98 \nMother\/ female guardian alcohol consumption .023 .42 .68 \nBest friend alcohol consumption  .059 1.25 .21 \nAlcohol given by parents\/guardians at home .307 4.72 .000 \nSeeing parents\/guardians drunk  .031 .62 .54 \nMeeting friends where alcohol is served .376 6.05 .000 \nNumber of friends who drink alcohol -.025 -.39 .70 \nNumber of friends getting drunk once a week .133 2.38 .02 \nParents\/ guardians knowing where Saturdays \nnights are spent \n.014 .34 .74 \nParents\u2019\/ Guardians\u2019 anticipated reaction to \ngetting drunk  \n.038 .92 .36 \nAmount of TV watching  .027 .56 .58 \nTV watching after 9pm  -.014 -.29 .77 \nAlcohol advertising on TV  .026 .57 .57 \nAlcohol advertising at the cinema .048 1.16 .25 \nAlcohol advertising in magazines  .022 .49 .63 \n \nRespondents\u2019 alcohol consumption was predicted by the increased frequency of \nbeing given alcohol by their parents, as well as by the greater number of friends who \nwould reportedly get drunk once a week (see Table 1). Separate analyses among males \nand females showed that having a greater number of friends who reportedly get drunk \n 12 \neach week was a significant predictor among male respondents only (Beta, 0.27, t = 2.74, \np<0.007).   \n \n[2] Type of Alcohol Consumption  \nA further series of multiple regression analyses was run to reveal predictors of the \nfrequency of the consumption of a number of distinct alcoholic beverage types. The \ncriterion for the selection of the brands included in the questionnaire was the volume of \nTV, cinema and print advertising for each brand in the UK from 2004 to 2006. The \nfrequency of reported consumption of each advertised brand was measured with a four-\npoint scale ranging from \u2018never\u2019 and to \u2018a lot\u2019. The predictor variables were the same as \nthose used in the excessive alcohol consumption analyses. \n \nPredictors of Beer and Alcopop Drinking \nIn the consumption of advertised brands for the various types of alcohol, it emerged that \nthe most statistically significant multiple regression analyses were for the consumption of \nbeer and alcopops (F (32, 264) = 23.37, p<0.001 and F (32, 324) = 22.3, p<0.001 \nrespectively). The overall percentages of variance accounted for by the predictor \nvariables were 73% for both beer and alcopop brands (Adjusted Multiple R Square = \n0.73). However, although the consumption of alcopop produced a statistically significant \nregression analysis for the two genders separately as well (Adjusted Multiple R Square = \n0.75 for the male respondents and Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.70 for the female \nrespondents), the respective analysis for the consumption of beer proved considerably \nmore significant for the males (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.82 for the male \nrespondents and Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.57 for the female respondents). \nIt emerged that the heavier consumption of beer and alcopop advertised brands was \npredicted by the increased frequency of buying alcohol when visiting a store. In the case \nof beer brands, heavier reported consumption was also predicted by the more frequent \npurchase of alcohol from a store during the \u2018last month\u2019. Moreover, in both cases, the \nheavier consumption was significantly related to the greater number of alcoholic drinks \nrespondents said they need to consume to get drunk. For the heavier overall consumption \nof the beer brands, the most significant predictor was the greater consumption of beer in \n 13 \nthe \u2018last 30 days\u2019, together with the lighter consumption of spirits, alcopops and cider in \nthe \u2018last 30 days\u2019. Another predictor of overall beer drinking was the older the age at \nwhich respondents had cider for the first time. The younger age at which respondents \nreportedly got drunk for the first time was also predicted by greater consumption of beer \nbrands (Table 2).  \nTable 2: Predictors of Consumption of Most Advertised Beer Brands in 2004-2006 \n \nPredictors  Beta T p < \nGender -.070 -1.71 .090 \nAge .028 .80 .43 \nAlcohol purchase when visiting a store .226 3.19 .002 \nDrank beer for the first time  .006 .13 .90 \nDrank cider for the first time  .128 2.82 .005 \nDrank wine for the first time  .010 .20 .84 \nDrank spirits for the first time  .018 .29 .77 \nDrank alcopop for the first time .004 .08 .94 \nGot drunk for the first time  -.174 -2.77 .006 \nBeer consumption\/ Last 30 days .631 11.25 .000 \nCider consumption\/ Last 30 days -.155 -3.20 .002 \nWine consumption\/ Last 30 days .020 .41 .68 \nSpirits consumption\/ Last 30 days -.194 -3.004 .003 \nAlcopop consumption\/ Last 30 days -.106 -2.55 .01 \nAlcohol purchase \/last 30 days .123 2.52 .01 \nFive or more drinks in a row\/last 30 days .017 .24 .81 \nNumber of drinks needed to get drunk .172 2.71 .007 \nFather\/male guardian alcohol consumption  .030 .66 .51 \nMother\/Female guardian alcohol consumption .048 .97 .34 \nBest friend alcohol consumption  -.008 -.18 .85 \nGiven alcohol by parents\/guardians .089 1.43 .16 \nSeen parents\/guardians drunk -.030 -.65 .52 \nMeet friends where alcohol is served .093 1.49 .14 \nNumber of friends who drink alcohol .005 .08 .94 \nNumber of friends who get drunk once a week -.091 -1.68 .10 \nParents\/ guardians knowing where Saturdays \nnights are spent \n-.047 -1.29 .20 \nParents\u2019\/ Guardians\u2019 anticipated reaction to \ngetting drunk  \n.054 1.45 .15 \nTV watching .004 .10 .92 \nTV watching after 9pm -.002 -.04 .97 \nBeer advertising on TV  .014 .36 .72 \nBeer advertising at the Cinema .020 .57 .57 \nBeer advertising in Magazines .000 .008 .99 \n \n 14 \nInterestingly, the heavier overall consumption of the advertised alcopop brands was \npredicted by the older the age at which respondents tried alcopop for the first time and by \nthe heavier reported consumption of alcopop over the \u2018last 30 days\u2019. It appears that \nstudents who prefer alcopop are less likely to drink beer as the increased frequency of \nconsuming alcopop brands was also predicted by the lighter consumption of beer in the \n\u2018last 30 days\u2019. A greater likelihood to binge drink was an additional predictor of heavier \nconsumption of the advertised alcopop brands.  \nThese three predictors proved significant in the separate gender analyses for both \nmale and female respondents. In addition, female respondents who preferred alcopops \nwere less likely to drink beer as the increased frequency of consuming alcopop brands \nwas also predicted by the lighter consumption of beer in the \u2018last 30 days\u2019 (Beta, -0.095, t \n= -1.50, p< 0.1). Female respondents who reported a preference for alcopop brands were \nmore likely to need more drinks to get drunk (Beta, 0.22, t = 2.54, p< 0.01), while they \nalso watched more TV after 9pm (Beta, 0.16, t = 2.12, p< 0.04).  \nAlcopop was one of the two types of beverage, along with cider, the heavier \nconsumption of which was predicted by the increased frequency of seeing advertisements \nof the same type on television. However, it emerged that the specific predictor variable \nwas significant only among the male respondents (Beta, 0.21, t =3.05, p< 0.003). Another \nsignificant predictor for the consumption of alcopop brands that re-emerged in the gender \nanalysis, but only for the male group, was the increased frequency of buying alcohol \nwhen visiting a store (Beta, 0.4, t = 3.25, p< 0.002) (Table 3).  \n 15 \nTable 3: Predictors of Consumption of Most Advertised Alcopop Brands in 2004-\n2006 \n \nPredictors  Beta t p < \nGender .060 1.48 .14 \nAge -.071 -1.95 .05 \nAlcohol purchase when visiting a store .264 3.74 .000 \nDrank beer for the first time  -.079 -1.57 .12 \nDrank cider for the first time  .009 .19 .85 \nDrank wine for the first time  -.015 -.29 .78 \nDrank spirits for the first time  .024 .386 .70 \nDrank alcopop for the first time .137 2.71 .007 \nGot drunk for the first time  .061 .10 .32 \nBeer consumption\/ Last 30 days -.121 -2.22 .03 \nCider consumption\/ Last 30 days -.042 -.87 .39 \nWine consumption\/ Last 30 days -.027 -.55 .58 \nSpirits consumption\/ Last 30 days -.077 -1.18 .24 \nAlcopop consumption\/ Last 30 days .197 4.67 .000 \nAlcohol purchase \/last 30 days .050 .10 .32 \nFive or more drinks in a row\/last 30 days .168 2.42 .02 \nNumber of drinks needed to get drunk .191 2.99 .003 \nFather\/male guardian alcohol consumption  .029 .63 .53 \nMother\/Female guardian alcohol consumption -.009 -.17 .86 \nBest friend alcohol consumption  .009 .20 .84 \nGiven alcohol by parents\/guardians .089 1.41 .16 \nSeen parents\/guardians drunk .017 .38 .71 \nMeet friends where alcohol is served .000 .008 .99 \nNumber of friends who drink alcohol .120 1.94 .05 \nNumber of friends who get drunk once a week -.026 -.47 .64 \nParents\/ guardians knowing where Saturdays \nnights are spent \n-.032 -.85 .40 \nParents\u2019\/ Guardians\u2019 anticipated reaction to \ngetting drunk  \n.033 .89 .38 \nTV watching -.010 -.22 .83 \nTV watching after 9pm .115 2.55 .02 \nAlcopop  advertising on TV  .095 2.29 .02 \nAlcopop advertising at the Cinema -.006 -.17 .87 \nAlcopop advertising in Magazines -.035 -.83 .41 \n \nPredictors of Spirits Drinking \nThe multiple regression analysis for the consumption of advertised spirits brands was \nsignificant (F (32, 266) = 19.7, p<0.001) with 69% of the overall variance accounted for \nby the predictor variables (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.69). In the separate gender \nanalysis, the predictor variables accounted for 77% of the variance in this variable in the \nmale sample well (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.77) and for 60% of the variance for \n 16 \nthe female sample (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0. 60), revealing another significant \ndiscrepancy between the two genders. \nSimilar to beer and alcopop brands, the heavier consumption of spirits was \npredicted by the more frequent purchase of alcohol when visiting a store generally and in \nthe \u2018last month\u2019 (Beta = 0.21, t = 2.73, p < 0.007). However, the purchase of alcohol \nwhen visiting a store was a significant predictor only for the heavier consumption of \nspirits brands by male respondents, as the regression analysis computed for the two \ngenders demonstrated (Beta, 0.49, t = 4.00, p< 0.001). This predictor did not emerge \namong female respondents. \nRespondents who reportedly consumed more spirits brands were also those saying \nthey needed more alcoholic drinks to get drunk (Beta = 0.28, t = 4.02, p < 0.001). This \nfinding could be explained by the fact that, as noted earlier, respondents who had \nconsumed spirits the last time they drank alcohol, consumed them in smaller quantities \nthan other beverage types. The heavier consumption of wine in the last month was \nanother predictor of the more frequent consumption of spirits brands (Beta = 0.13, t = \n2.51, p < 0.01). Although the specific predictor re-emerged in the analysis conducted for \nboth the male and female respondents, it was found to be more significant among the \nmale respondents (Beta, 1.0, t = 2.64, p< 0.01) than for the female respondents (Beta = \n0.10, t = 1.27, p < 0.02).   \n \nPredictors of Cider Drinking \nA somewhat weaker multiple regression analysis emerged for the consumption of cider \n(F (32, 267) = 12.4, p< 0.001) where the selected predictor variables explained 60% of \nthe variance in the specific variable (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.60). A similar \nfinding was also reflected in the gender analysis with the selected predictor variables \nexplaining 63% of the variance in the male group (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 0.63) \nand only 50% in the female group (Adjusted Multiple R Square = 50). Cider was the \nsecond type of beverage the heavier consumption of which was predicted by the \nincreasing exposure to TV advertising, but the connection of the two variables was \nsignificant only for the female respondents (Beta, 0.27, t = 3.75, p< 0.000). However, \n 17 \nbecause only one cider brand \u2013 Strongbow - was featured in the analysis, the findings \nshould be treated with caution.  \n \nPredictors of Wine Drinking \nThe regression analysis for the consumption of the most advertised brands of wine was \nstatistically the weakest among the five types of beverage (F (32, 267) = 3.63). In this \ncase, the predictor variables accounted for only 24% of the variance in this variable. A \nmuch weaker regression analysis emerged in the analysis conducted for the two genders \nas well. Hence, the predictor variables accounted for only 33%% of the variance in the \nmale group and 10% in the female group. \nThe heavier consumption of the most advertised wine brands was mostly predicted \nby the younger age at which respondents reportedly first got drunk (Beta = -0.20, t = -\n2.02, p 0.04), the more drinks they said they needed to consume to get drunk (Beta = \n0.37, t = 3.48, p < 0.001), the more frequent purchase of any alcoholic beverages during \nthe \u2018last month\u2019 (Beta = 0.25, t = 3.00, p < 0.003), and the more their father\/male \nguardian drank (Beta = 0.16, t = 2.09, p < 0.02). Parental influence was evident in the \nconsumption of wine specifically among the female respondents with the heavier \nreported consumption by the father or male guardian being another predictor for this \nvariable (Beta, 0.23, t = 2.12, p< 0.04).  \n 18 \n  \nDiscussion \nA survey was reported of young people\u2019s alcohol consumption that examined the \nsignificance of alcohol advertising exposure, alongside family and peer group factors, as \npredictors of reported consumption. Consumption was measured here in terms of self-\nreported frequencies of drinking alcohol in general and consumption of different types of \nalcoholic beverage (beer, cider, wine, spirits and alcopops). Five research questions were \naddressed by this investigation. \nRQ1 asked if greater reported exposure to alcohol advertising was significant \nrelated to reported frequency or amount of alcohol consumption. Following on from this \nRQ2 asked whether reported exposure to alcohol advertising predicted alcohol \nconsumption in the presence of controls for family and peer group factors. Previous \nresearch had indicated that exposure to alcohol advertising is associated with young \npersons\u2019 consumption of alcohol (Atkin & Block, 1984; Ellickson et al., 2005).  \nIn relation to the overall amount of reported drinking of alcohol, there was no \nevidence here that exposure to alcohol advertising was an important predictor variable. \nInstead, parental and peer group influences emerged as more significant. Parental \ndrinking (especially by the male parent or guardian) and having friends who drink and \nspending time drinking with friends were the most important factors that underpinned \nhow often the young people in this sample reported consumption of alcohol. This pattern \nwas true regardless of whether they were asked about how often they drank during their \nlifetime, over the previous 12 months or over the previous 30 days. \nRQ3 asked whether the potency of alcohol advertising to influence alcohol \nconsumption varied between media. Researchers have previously reported that young \npeople often display a strong liking for alcohol advertising, and especially that which \nappears on television (Aitken et al., 1988; Wyllie et al., 1998). Data produced here \nindicated that there are differences in the potential effects of advertising between cinema, \nmagazine and television advertising but that these occurred in relation to reported \nconsumption of specific types of alcoholic beverage rather than in relation to overall \nreported consumption of alcohol. Only TV advertising emerged as a significant predictor \nand then only in relation to reported consumption of cider and alcopops. \n 19 \nRQ4 asked whether alcohol advertising effects varied between different types of \nalcoholic beverage. Previous research found that reported exposure to television alcohol \nadvertising was significantly related to teenagers\u2019 reported consumption of beer and wine \n(Stacy et al., 2004). Elsewhere, a modest effect of alcohol advertising recall was fond in \nrelation to beer drinking among teenagers (Connolly et al., 1994).  To address this \nquestion, a series of analyses examined predictors of reported consumption of five \ndifferent types of alcohol (beer, cider, wine, spirits and alcopop), based on respondents\u2019 \nreported consumption of the most advertised brands (per beverage type) during 2004-\n2006. At the outset all these types of alcoholic beverage were aggregated to produce an \noverall measure of alcohol consumption. The extent to which specific types of alcoholic \nbeverage \u2013 especially beer, cider and spirits \u2013 had been recently consumed was, not \nsurprisingly, the major predictor of this measure of general alcohol consumption. None of \nthe advertising measures predicted overall alcohol consumption, but there was a point-of-\nsale factor. Respondents who said that they regularly purchased alcohol when visiting a \nshop were more regular consumers of the mot advertised alcohol brands. \nAs noted above, reported consumption of only two types of alcoholic beverage \u2013 \ncider and alcopop \u2013 was predicted by exposure to any form of alcohol advertising. There \nwere no significant advertising predictors of reported consumption of the most advertised \nbrands of beer, wine or spirits. In the case of coder and alcopop drinks, exposure to \ntelevised advertising of these drinks predicted frequency of consumption of their most \nadvertised brands. In addition, reported frequencies of consumption of the most \nadvertised brands of cider and alcopop and also of spirits were also predicted by a point-\nof-sale influence (regularity of make alcohol purchases when visiting a shop). \nRQ5 asked whether there were any differences in relationships between reported \nalcohol consumption and advertising exposure between male and female respondents. \nBoys have previously been found to exhibit stronger dependence than girls on advertising \nfor information about alcohol (Wyllie et al., 1998). A series of separate multiple \nregression analyses for each gender addressed this question. A gender difference emerged \nin the case of alcopops where for male respondents only, reported exposure to televised \nadvertising for these drinks predicted their consumption.   \n 20 \nThis research has indicated therefore that a range of factors in a young person\u2019s \nenvironment are linked to their consumption of alcohol. Alcohol advertising on television \n(though not in any other media) and point-of-sale attention to alcohol are among the key \npredictors. What this research has also shown, however, is that in identifying possible \ninfluences of alcohol advertising, it is important to differentiate between different types \nof alcohol consumption. It is not alcohol consumption per se that is affected by \nadvertising, but specific types of alcohol consumption.  \n \nReferences \nAdlaf, E. M., & Kohn, P. M.
