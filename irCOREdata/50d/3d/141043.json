This is \nparticularly true for bearing defect diagnosis and seal rubbing [1-5]. The main drawback \nwith the application of the AE technique is the attenuation of the signal and as such the \nAE sensor has to be close to its source. However, it is often practical to place the AE \nsensor on the non-rotating member of the machine, such as the bearing or gear casing. \nTherefore, the AE signal originating from the defective component will suffer severe \nattenuation before reaching the sensor. Typical frequencies associated with AE activity \nrange from 20 kHz to 1MHz.  \n \nWhilst vibration analysis on gear fault diagnosis is well established, the application of \nAE to this field is still in its infancy. In addition, there are limited publications on \napplication of AE to gear fault diagnosis. Siores et al [6] explored several AE analysis \ntechniques in an attempt to correlate all possible failure modes of a gearbox during its \nuseful life. Failures such as excessive backlash, shaft misalignment, tooth breakage, \nscuffing and a worn tooth were seeded during tests. Siores correlated the various seeded \nfailure modes of the gearbox with the AE amplitude, r.m.s. standard deviation and \nduration. It was concluded that the AE results could be correlated to various defect \nconditions. Sentoku [7] correlated tooth surface damage such as pitting to AE activity. \nAn AE sensor was mounted on the gear wheel and the AE signature was transmitted \nfrom the sensor to data acquisition card across a mercury slip ring. It was concluded that \nAE amplitude and energy increased with increased pitting.  \n 3\nSingh et al [8] assessed the transmissibility of AE\u2019s within a gearbox. The tests were \nperformed with different torque levels using lead pencil breaks to simulate AE activity \nin the gearbox. This technique is known as the Nielsen source test. Various AE \ntransmission paths were examined. One AE sensor was placed on the gear wheel to \nmeasure the initial strength of the signature and second sensor was mounted on the \nbearing pedestal to capture the transmitted signal. It was observed that greater \nattenuation was experienced for lighter loads though attenuation remained rather \nconstant at the high load conditions. Singh et al concluded that the attenuation across \nthe gearbox was an accumulation of losses across each individual interfaces within the \ntransmission path and the optimum path of propagation will be the one with the smallest \ncumulative loss. \n \nIn a separate study, Singh et al [9] studied the feasibility of AE for gear fault diagnosis. \nIn one test a simulated pit was introduced on the pitch line of a gear tooth using an \nElectrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process. An AE sensor and an accelerometer for \ncomparative purposes were employed in both test cases. It was important to note that \nboth the accelerometer and AE sensor were placed on the gearbox casing. It was \nobserved that the AE amplitude increased with increased rotational speed and increased \nAE activity was observed with increased pitting. In a second test, periodically occurring \npeaks were observed when natural pitting started to appear after half an hour of \noperation. These AE activities increased as the pitting spread over more teeth. Singh et \nal concluded that AE could provide earlier detection over vibration monitoring for \npitting of gears, but noted it could not be applicable at extremely high speeds or for \nunloaded gear conditions. \n 4\nTandon et al. [10] performed an experiment to correlate AE parameters, such as peak \namplitude, ringdown count and energy with gear defect size. Simulated pits on the \npitch-line with constant depth (500\u00b5m) and varying diameters from 250 to 2200\u00b5m \nwere introduced using spark erosion technique. Tandon et al observed that the \nmonitored AE parameters increased with defect size (pit diameter) and load. Tandon et \nal also concluded that AE has a better detection capability over vibration since it was \nable to detect smaller pit sizes. \n \nAl-Balushi et al [11] explored and compared the energy-based methods to the statistical \nmethods (such as Kurtosis, Crest Factor etc) for diagnosis of a gear defect. Using the \nenergy indexes, Al-Balushi et al was able to relate the square root of energy index, \ncumulative energy index and cumulative square root of energy index to broken tooth \nand pitting conditions. The energy-based method was further applied on the vibration \ndata collected from a helicopter intermediate gearbox. Al-Balushi suggested that the \nproposed technique was applicable and effective in detection of incipient fault on \nhelicopter gearboxes.  \n \nToutountzakis et al [12] presented some interesting observations during the gear defect \ndiagnosis testing. The test was performed on a back-to-back gearbox with a spur gear \nset of 49 and 65 teeth, using a variable speed controller to alter the rotational speed of \nthe motor. The AE sensor used was placed on the pinion and a silver contact air-cooled \nslip ring was employed to transmit the AE signal for further processing. During the test, \nthe rotational speed was varied from 600 rpm to 1800 rpm, and observations of AE \n 5\nactivity due to misalignment and natural pitting were observed. Toutountzakis et al \nconcluded that AE technique demonstrated the potential for gear fault diagnosis. \n \nAlthough the development of AE in gear diagnosis is in its infancy, the papers reviewed \nhave illustrated the potential and viability of AE becoming a useful diagnostic tool in \ncondition monitoring of gears. However, more detailed investigations are required to \nensure this technique is robust and applicable for operational gearboxes. The purpose of \nthis investigation was to validate the AE technique and determine an effective AE \nindicator for gear defect detection. \n \nExperimental set-up \n \nThe test-rig employed for this investigation consisted of two identical oil-bath \nlubricated gearboxes, connected in a back-to-back arrangement, see figure 1. The gear \nset employed were made of 045M15 steel without any heat treatment. The gears (49 and \n65 teeth) had a module of 3 mm, a pressure angle of 20\u00b0, and a surface roughness of \nbetween 2-3 \u00b5m. Each gearbox had four identical ball bearings. A simple mechanism \nthat permitted a pair of coupling flanges to be rotated relative to each other, and locked \nin position, was employed to apply torque to the gears. The effect of this process was to \ntwist the shafts and lock in the torque within the loop of the back-to-back gearbox. \nThree torque values were used for the experiment: 0 Nm, 55 Nm and 110 Nm. The \ncontact ratio of the gear was 1.77. The motors used to drive the gearbox were single \nspeed motors (1.1 KW and 0.55 KW) with a running speed of 745 and 1460 rpm \nrespectively. The lubricant employed was an EP SAE 80W-90, GL-4 API multi-grade \n 6\ngearbox oil, so as to keep natural pitting and wear to a minimum level during the seeded \nfault tests. \n \n \nFigure 1 Test-rig gearboxes in back-to-back arrangement \n \nSensors and Acquisition Systems \n \nThe AE sensors used for this experiment were broadband type sensors with a relative \nflat response in the region between 100 KHz to 1MHz (Model: WD, \u2018Physical \nAcoustics Corporation\u2019). One sensor was placed on pinion (49 teeth) and the other on \nthe bearing casing (figure 2) of the pinion shaft. The cable connecting the sensor placed \non the pinion with the pre-amplifier was fed into the shaft and connected to a slip ring, \nsee figure 3. This arrangement allowed the AE sensor to be placed as close as possible \nto the gear teeth. Both sensors were held in place with mechanical fixtures. A PH-12 \nslip rig manufactured by \u2018IDM Electronics Ltd\u2019 was employed. The slip ring used silver \n 7\ncontacts and could accommodate up to 12 channels. The slip ring had an air intake \nwhere pressurised air was fed for cooling purposes at a rate of 1.4kg\/cm2 (figure 3). The \noutput signal from the AE sensors was pre-amplified at either 40 or 20dB. The signal \noutput from the pre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial cable) directly to a \ncommercial data acquisition card where a sampling rate of 10MHz was used during the \ntests. Prior to the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), the card employed anti-aliasing \nfilters that can be controlled directly in software.  \n \nFigure 2 AE sensors located on the pinion and bearing casing. \nSensor \non Gear \nSensor on \nBearing \n 8\n \nFigure 3 Slip ring coupled with cool compressed air supply. \n \nTest Procedures \n \nThe gearbox was run-in for more than 15 hours before the actual experiment was carried \nout. Prior to the start of the test, attenuation test on the gearbox components was \nundertaken in order to understand the characteristics of the test-rig.  \n \nThe test started at a rotational speed of 745 rpm with a seeded large addendum defect \n(extended from the pitch-line) measuring 12 mm along the face width by 3 mm from \npitch-line to tooth tip (see figure 4). The seeded defect was introduced on the tooth flank \nof the pinion wheel using an engraving machine. The gearbox was run for 30 minutes \nprior to acquiring AE data for the no load condition. The gearbox was then shut down to \nadjust to the next torque level (55 Nm). After another 30 minutes of continuous running, \nthe AE data for this load condition was acquired.  This procedure was repeated for the \nCool Air \nSupply \n 9\nload condition of 110 Nm. These procedures were repeated at a higher rotational speed \nof 1460 rpm. \n \nBased on the sampling rate of 10 MHz, the acquisition time available for recording was \n0.0256 seconds which represented 0.32 (16 teeth) and 0.62 (30 teeth) revolutions of the \npinion at 745 and 1460 rpm respectively. By employing a trigger mechanism, only AE \ndata from the portion of the pinion gear wheel where the defect was located was \nacquired. The trigger system was set such that the defective gear tooth was at the mid \npoint of the acquisition window (0.0256 seconds), see figure 5. \n \nThe AE parameters chosen for the gear defect diagnosis were; root mean square (r.m.s), \nenergy and crest factor. The r.m.s. and energy are the most common AE parameters \nusually employed for diagnosis; whereas the crest factor was employed to measure the \n\u2018spikiness\u2019 of the AE signal which was expected to vary for these tests. \n \n \nFigure 4 Seeded large addendum defect. \nSeeded \nDefect \n 10\n 1    2   3   4   5    6    7   8   9   10  11 12 13 14  15  16  (Teeth Number)\n       A     B        C     D         E \nGear Teeth \nDefective Tooth\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5  Sectioning of gear teeth for analysis. \n \nAttenuation Test \n \nA 0.5 mm diameter and 3 mm length 2H lead pencil was broken at different positions in \norder to establish the attenuation of the AE signal. This technique is known as the \nNielsen source test. Figure 6 presents the schematic diagram for the attenuation test \ndisplaying the different simulation positions and different interfaces the AE signatures \nwould have to propagate across. Table 1 shows the relative attenuation values.  The \nreference signal employed for the attenuation calculations was the AE response from a \nlead break next to the AE sensor on the pinion gear. Five pencil breaks were acquired \nfrom each position and averaged. \n \nThe greatest attenuation of simulated AE signatures was observed on the bearing. This \nwas expected due to the number of interfaces the AE signature would need to propagate \nacross. The position of the balls in the bearing can affect the transmissibility of the AE \nsignal. If a ball is in the loaded zone while the AE waves were travelling through, better \ntransmissibility can be expected. Relatively high attenuation was also observed for lead \n 11\nbreaks on the wheel (big gear). This was expected as the wheel is furthest away from \nthe sensor; however, the attenuation values of lead breaks on the pinion and shaft were \nsimilar. It was expected that the attenuation would be greater on the shaft due to the \ninterface between the shaft and the pinion gear but this was not the case. This is \nattributed to experimental errors and the close proximity at both locations. \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Schematic diagram for the attenuation test displaying different \ninterfaces. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPencil \nbreaking \nlocations \nWheel \nPinion\nX\u2019 X\u2019 \nBearingShaft\n AE Sensor \n AE Sensor \n 12\nInterface Average Amplitude Relative Attenuation (dB) \nBearing 0.093 -34.64 \nWheel 0.257 -25.90 \nPinion 1.829 -8.86 \nShaft 2.120 -7.58 \n   \nReference Position 5.074 0 \nTable 1 Relative attenuation values \n \nResults of operational background noise \n \nThe application of AE to gear diagnostics is considered to be relatively new. Although \nthere are many AE analysis techniques available, selection of a robust technique is of \nparamount importance if AE is to gain acceptability as a diagnostic tool.  \n \nFigure 7 displays a typical AE signature with corresponding frequency spectrum \nassociated with operational noise. It clearly shows 16 meshing teeth that included the \ndefective tooth. This is the first known published document that presents the gear \nmeshing AE transient response in the time domain. The frequency range of the AE \nsignals associated with these tests ranged from 75 kHz to 350 kHz. Figures 8 and 9 \nillustrate the time domain signatures for the load and speed cases considered. The gear \nmesh frequency can also be calculated from the time domain AE signal by inversing the \nperiodic time between two subsequent AE burst. It must be noted that at 1460rpm the \nAE bursts associated with the gear mesh was not as clearly visible as at 745rpm. This \n 13\nwas principally due to the limit of sampling frequency on the acquisition system.  At a \nfaster sampling rate it would be expected that the AE bursts associated with the gear \nmesh at 1460rpm will be clearly visible. \n \nFor analysis of AE data obtained from these experiments, r.m.s and energy were not \nonly employed to provide a comparison to other published work but principally because \nof the simplicity and proven robustness of these parameters for machine health \ndiagnosis. In addition, the calculation of crest factor on the same AE data allowed the \nauthors to understand some of the characteristics of the AE signatures. \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\nTime (seconds)\nV\nol\nts\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nx 10\n5\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\nFrequency (Hz)\nV\nol\nts\n \n \nFigure 7 Time and frequency domain of an AE signature showing clearly the \nAE transient response associated with gear meshing of 16 teeth for \nthe rotational speed of 745 rpm (pre-amplification 40dB, 110Nm) \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) (4) (5) \n(6) (7) (8) \n(9) (10) \n(11) \n(12) \n(13) (14) (15) (16) \nAE transient bursts \nassociated with gear \nmesh \n 14\nFigure 8  Raw AE signal for large addendum defect for (a) no load, (b) 55 Nm \nload and (c) 110 Nm load at 745 rpm (pre-amplification 40dB)  \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-5\n0\n5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-5\n0\n5\nTime (seconds)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n \nFigure 9 Raw AE signal for large addendum defect for (a) no load, (b) 55 Nm \nload and (c) 110 Nm load at 1460 rpm (pre-amplification 40dB) \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-5\n0\n5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nTime (seconds)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (V\n)\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\n 15\nResults of defect simulations \n \nFor the rotational speeds of 745 and 1460 rpm, the recorded AE time waveform was \ndivided into five and ten different regions respectively, with each region representing 3-\nteeth, figure 5 illustrated the case of 745 rpm. The r.m.s. value of each region was \ncomputed and plotted against the three loading conditions. It was thought that this \nmethod of grouping the data would enhance the possibilities of detecting the seeded \ndefect particularly as the defect has been seeded in the centre of the acquisition window. \nA total of 50 data sets, each equivalent to a time frame encompassing sixteen teeth, \nwere acquired and averaged in each region. The averaging could be accomplished due \nto the optical triggering system employed ensuring that the acquisition system always \nstarted at the same rotational position of the gears. \n \nFor the seeded defect simulation at 745 rpm, the r.m.s. values remained random for the \nthree loading conditions, see figure 10, as no definite trend was observed. The centre \nregion \u20183\u2019, where the seeded defect was introduced, did not exhibit the highest r.m.s. \nvalue as expected. Similar observations were made for the rotational speed of 1460 rpm, \nthe highest r.m.s. value did not occur at the seeded fault region (region \u20185\u2019), see figure \n11.  \n \n 16\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n1 2 3 4 5\nRegion\nr.m\n.s\n.

(10 regions) \n 17\nIn order to confirm the authenticity of these results the recorded AE data was split \nfurther into regions representing 2-teeth and 1-tooth for the rotational speed of 745 and \n1460 rpm respectively. The r.m.s. value of each region was computed and plotted \nagainst the three load conditions for the defect condition, see figures 12 to 15. For the 2-\nteeth analysis, figures 12 and 13, it was observed that the maximum r.m.s. values did \nnot occur at regions \u20184\u2019 and \u20188\u2019 for 745 and 1460 rpm respectively. From figures 14 and \n15, similar observations were noted, the r.m.s. values at the seeded fault tooth, regions \n\u20188\u2019 and \u201815\u2019 (based on a single tooth demarcation for 745 and 1460 rpm respectively), \nwere not the highest values. The inconsistency between the single tooth, 2-teeth and 3-\nteeth analysis for both speed conditions revealed that this technique was inconsistent for \ndefect identification. The results would have been conclusive had the r.m.s. levels for \nthe defective tooth being higher than other regions within the acquisition window. For \nthe same test condition, AE energy exhibited similar observations see figures 16 to 21. \n \nThe raw AE signals from defect conditions are displayed in figures 8 and 9. This shows \nthe non-consistent observation of AE burst in relation to the defect position. The biggest \nburst of the AE signal did not always occur in the centre region of the window where \nthe seed fault was located even though the defect was comparatively large. Hence, it \nwas not possible to detect the seeded defect using the AE indicators of r.m.s. and \nenergy. This contradicts the work of a few researchers [6, 9, 10] that claimed AE \nindicators could clearly identify a simulated pit defect. \n \nSome interesting observations were noted from figures 10 to 15. Firstly, at 745 rpm for \nthe 1-, 2- and 3- teeth analysis, the r.m.s. values for the three load conditions varied \n 18\nfrom 0.1 to 0.6 volts whilst at the higher speed, r.m.s. values varied from 0.1 to 1.8 \nvolts. Secondly, it was noted that the r.m.s. values for the unloaded conditions at both \nspeeds are similar. In general, the r.m.s. values increased with increasing load \nconditions. It was observed that the loaded conditions at 745 rpm had similar r.m.s. \nvalues whereas at 1460 rpm the r.m.s. values were distinctly different. Average r.m.s. \nand energy values for all the test conditions were calculated and plotted in figures 22 \nand 23, reiterating observations between r.m.s., load and speed. \n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nRegion\nr.m\n.s\n.

The \ncrest factor was computed per data file and averaged over fifty data files per simulation. \nThe crest factor for the defect conditions under the various load and speed combinations \ncan be seen in figure 24. It was observed that the crest factor decreased with increased \nload for both speed conditions. The crest factors at 745 rpm were always higher than \nthose of 1460 rpm for the corresponding load conditions. In order to understand these \nobservations, the peak amplitude values for the same test conditions were computed and \nplotted in figure 25. For both speed conditions, the peak amplitude increased with \nincreased load except for 110 Nm at 745 rpm. \n 25\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\n18.00\n600 1200 1800\nRotational Speed (rpm)\nC\nre\nst\n F\nac\nto\nr\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \nFigure 24 Crest factors for the six test conditions. \n \n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n4.00\n5.00\n6.00\n7.00\n8.00\n9.00\n600 1200 1800\nRotational Speed (rpm)\nPe\nak\n A\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (v\n)\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \nFigure 25 Peak Amplitudes for the six test conditions. \n \n 26\nFrom figures 22 and 24, it was observed that crest factor decreased with increasing load \nwhile r.m.s values increased with increasing load at 745 and 1460 rpm. Table 2 provides \nthe detailed changes in r.m.s values and peak amplitude at 745 rpm. From 0 to 55 Nm \nload, the r.m.s value increased more than the peak amplitude which gave an overall \ndecrease in crest factor. From 55 to 110 Nm load, the peak amplitude decreased much \nmore than the increase in r.m.s. which provide an overall effect of reducing the crest \nfactor. However, as the load was increased from 55 to 110 Nm, only a slight increase in \nr.m.s. was observed with a reduction in peak amplitude. The exact reason for this was \nunclear at this stage of the investigation. It was expected that the peak amplitude and \nr.m.s. would increase with increasing load. \n \n Peak Amplitude (v) % change r.m.s.

For this condition to exist, the peak \namplitudes must either be constant, decrease or increase to a lesser extent than r.m.s. \nvalues. From table 3, it became apparent that r.m.s. values increased more than the peak \namplitudes when the load was increased incrementally to 110 Nm.  \n \n 27\n Peak Amplitude (v) % change r.m.s.

This increase \nin r.m.s. was interpreted as a direct consequence of the increased area for frictional \ncontact as an increase in load will result in greater contact between meshing teeth. \n \nAE Observations from the bearing housing \n \nWhilst AE signatures recorded on the pinion was triggered when the defect was in the \n\u2018gear mesh window\u2019, the AE sensor on the bearing casing was synchronised with the \nAE sensor on the pinion. As such, when the data acquisition system was triggered, both \nAE sensors captured data simultaneously. \n \nDuring the test, it was noted that the AE bursts relating to the gear mesh, as detected on \nthe sensor fixed onto the pinion, were also observed from the sensor on the bearing \ncasing, see figures 26 and 27. However, continuous observations of the AE sensor on \nthe bearing casing showed intermediate loss of the AE bursts associated with the gear \nmesh. The reason for this is attributed to the position of the bearing ball\/roller elements \n 28\nduring rotation. It is postulated that when the ball\/roller is at bottom dead centre, i.e. \ndirectly in the load path, the transmission of the AE bursts to the sensor on the bearing \ncasing was most favourable and only under this circumstance. As the relative \nattenuation ranged from 44dB to 26dB (depending on the particular gear mesh AE \nburst, see figure 26), in addition to the high probability of loss of transmission path \nthrough the bearing, see figures 27 and 28, the authors see identifying gear defects and \nmonitoring gear deterioration from the bearing casing as fraught with difficulties, again \ncontrary to other investigators [6, 9, 11].  \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.06\n-0.04\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\nSensor on gear \nSensor on bearing case \n \nFigure 26 AE bursts detected on pinion sensor were observed on bearing \ncasing sensor, speed 745 rpm and load 55 Nm (pre-amplification \n40dB) \n \n \n26dB attenuation 44dB attenuation\n 29\n \n \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nV\nol\nts\n \nFigure 27 Loss of transmission path at particular gear mesh positions observed \non bearing casing sensor, at speed 745 rpm and load 55Nm (pre-\namplification 20dB) \nLoss of transmission through bearing \n 30\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\nTime (seconds)\nV\nol\nts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nV\nol\nts\n Sensor on gear\nSensor on bearing case \n \nFigure 28 AE bursts detected on pinion sensor were observed on bearing \ncasing sensor, speed 1460 rpm and load 0 Nm (pre-amplification \n20dB) \nDiscussions \n \nThe relationship between AE peak amplitude and r.m.s. with load was evident. \nIncreasing the load resulted in an increase in AE r.m.s. and peak amplitude. However, \nthe results of AE r.m.s and energy presented thus far were considered unsatisfactory in \nidentifying the defect location. This resulted in additional tests to explain the \ndiscrepancies, particularly as other authors had supported the applicability of these \nparameters to gear defect detection. The objective of the new test was to establish if \noperating conditions such as the oil temperature influenced AE levels. Whilst this would \nnot directly enhance fault identification, it would provide important information on \nwhat influences AE activity within the gearbox. These new tests were carried out using \nLoss of transmission through bearing \n 31\nthe same test set-up, but in this instance the AE r.m.s. and energy data were monitored \nand recorded continuously while oil temperature in the gearbox was also measured at \nfifteen minute intervals. \n \nContinuous AE energy and r.m.s values were calculated in real time by the Analog to \nDigital Converter (ADC) controlling software. This software employed a hardware \naccelerator to perform calculations in real time. The hardware accelerator takes each \nvalue from the ADC and squares it. These results are added into an accumulator for a \nprogrammable time interval set by the user, 100 ms in this instance. The accumulator is \ncleared at the start of the time interval, and the accumulator value will only be stored at \nthe end of the time interval. The r.m.s is then calculated by taking the square root of the \nsum of the accumulated squared ADC readings. The energy value computed was \nequivalent to the area under the time waveform and is measured in Atto-Joules. The \ntime interval for acquisition was also set at 100 ms.  \n \nThese additional tests were run at three load conditions until the AE r.m.s., AE energy \nand oil temperatures stabilised. The tests were terminated when the AE parameters and \noil temperatures remain stable for one hour. Stabilisation at the oil temperatures was \nachieved when the temperature remained within 0.20C for the duration of one hour. \n \nFigures 29 and 30 illustrates that the gearbox system only reached a stabilised \ntemperature after at least 5 hours of continuous running for both speed conditions. The \nstarting point for all three test conditions investigated was dependent on the ambient \ntemperature prior to testing. A smoothening technique was applied to the continuous AE \n 32\ndata using moving average of 255 points. From figures 31 to 34, it was noted that the \nAE r.m.s. and energy levels varied with time as the gear box reached a stabilised \ntemperature. This implied that depending on what time the AE data was collected for a \ngiven speed and load condition, the variation in AE activity r.m.s could be as much as \n33% (55Nm) and 60% (110Nm) for 745 rpm, and, 125% (55Nm) and 48% (110Nm) at \n1460 rpm. The variation for energy ranged from 140% (55Nm) and 107% (110Nm) for \n745 rpm, and, 300% (55Nm) and 113% (110Nm) at 1460 rpm. These values were \ncalculated based on the variation between the minimum and maximum AE values \n(energy, r.m.s) for each test condition. For these particular tests the point at which the \ndata was captured is highlighted in figures 31 to 34. Thus, the AE signal captured \nduring seeded defect tests were \u2018snapshots\u2019 that are largely influenced by load and oil \ntemperature. As \u2018snapshots\u2019 only provide information at an instance in time, the \nrepeatability of the derived AE parameters will be subjected to considerable variation. \nThe influence of load and oil temperature on AE activity is directly linked to the oil film \nthickness between the meshing gears. The oil film thickness will influence the rate of \nwear and asperity deformation, both of which generate the AE activity.  \n \nFurthermore, it is postulated the AE r.m.s values for 55Nm and 110Nm fluctuated as a \nfunction of increasing oil temperature (figures 31 to 34) because the gear teeth surfaces \nattempted to strike a balance between increasing lubricant temperature and decreasing \nsurface roughness (these tests were started from \u2018cold conditions\u2019 and the gears were \nnot run-in). These two factors have opposing effects on the AE levels; the former \nincreases AE levels as oil film thickness reduces and asperity contact increases. The \nlatter reduces the AE levels as the gear teeth surfaces smoothen. Clearly, the initial \n 33\nlubricant temperature and surface roughness of the meshing gear teeth surface will \ndetermine the starting level of AE but the running\/operating AE levels during \ntemperature changing periods will reflect the balance described above and will be a \nfunction of operating time and rotational speed.  \n \nThe complications of the effect of oil temperature on AE activity have far reaching \nconsequences, particularly as most of the published work to date have not take \ncognisance of this effect. The authors of this paper believe it is fundamentally flawed to \ncompare AE activity from defect free and\/or simulated defect conditions under varying \nloads without accounting for the influence of oil temperature. Whilst researchers [6, 9, \n10] have stated that AE indicators such as r.m.s. and energy increased with increasing \nload and speed, none have taken cognisance of the effect of temperature on AE activity. \nClearly measuring the load and speed will cause a change in lubricant temperature. The \nauthors believe that the lubricant temperature is an influential factor in the AE \ngeneration, in addition to the rotational speed and load. This implies that whilst other \nresearchers have stipulated the effect of load\/speed on AE activity, the time of data \nacquisition, in effect the temperature of the lubricant, will determine what values of \nr.m.s. are obtained. If as observed in this paper, the AE parameters continually change \nfor several hours, the data presented by other researchers are subjected to environmental \nconditions. Even if attempts were undertaken to collect AE data at specified times, the \neffect of ambient temperature, which will influence the temperature at which the data is \ncollected, could present inconsistencies or repeatability issues. Developing AE as a \nrobust diagnosis tool without taking cognisance of the temperature influence will \nsubject to error.   \n 34\n \nTemperature variations do not have a direct influence in this particular study, where \ncomparative AE signatures associated with each tooth have been analysed. This is \nbecause at the time of data acquisition all teeth will experience the same lubricant \ntemperature. However, the influence of temperature on AE levels has not been \npreviously assessed in the context of gearbox diagnosis with AE. The effect of oil \ntemperature variation on generation of AE activity is currently under investigation and \nwill be the subject of a future publication. It may be worth stating that the influence of \noil temperature on AE activity for the higher rotational speed (1460 rpm) showed \nrelatively greater variations than that at 745 rpm. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nTime (hours)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (D\neg\nre\ne \nC\n)\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \nFigure 29 Oil temperatures monitoring with no-load, 55 Nm-load and 110 Nm-\nload conditions at 745 rpm. \n 35\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nTime (hours)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (D\neg\nre\ne \nC\n)\n0 Nm\n55 Nm\n110 Nm\n \nFigure 30 Oil temperatures monitoring with no-load, 55 Nm-load and 110 Nm-\nload conditions at 1460 rpm. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000\nTime (s)\nr.m\n.s\n.

Therefore \nthe authors argue that defect identification of seeded defects of this nature cannot be \naccomplished with the AE technique. This statement will hold true if the seeded defect \ninvolved the removal of material from the surface. However, other authors [6, 9, 10] \nhave claimed success and it is argued that the more likely reason for this is as follows: It \nis highly possible that in the process of material removal from the gear face \u2018mounds\u2019 or \n\u2018protrusions\u2019 will be formed at the boundaries of the seeded defect, see figure 35. These \nare created due to the displacement of material from the region of material removal. The \nAcquisition time for the test \n0 Nm \n55 Nm \n110 Nm \n 38\nauthors postulate that it is these \u2018protrusions\u2019 that was responsible for AE activity. \nHowever, this activity will only last until the \u2018protrusions\u2019 are flattened during the \noperation of the gear, see figure 36. In the later instance, AE will be generated by \nasperity contacts. \n \n \nFigure 35 Mounds or Protrusions of the gear surfaces in contact during \nrotation. \n \nFigure 36  Flattened protrusions of gear surfaces \n \nThe wear or pitting process of gears involves initiation of micro-cracks, crack growth \nand the removal of tiny particles from the gear surface which will emit AE. \nFlattening of \n\u2018protrusions\u2019 \nTooth surface \nof gear 1 \nTooth surface \nof gear 2 \nSeeded Defect \nSource of AE activity: \ncontact of asperity and \nprotrusion \nTooth surface \nof gear 1 \nTooth surface \nof gear 2 \n 39\nFurthermore, the removed wear particles or debris trapped between mating gear surfaces \nwill create third-body abrasions. This condition will further enhance generation of AE \nsignatures. For a better assessment on the detection capability of AE, it is recommended \nto perform the experiment in a condition which natural pitting or wear is allowed (i.e. \ngear fatigue test) rather than seeded defect test.  AE parameters such as r.m.s. and \nenergy can be used to monitor the gear fatigue process, though natural defects will \npossibly only generate AE transients for relatively short time periods superimposed on \nrandom operational noise. Due consideration must be given to this in developing a \ndiagnostics tool to relate gear wear to AE activity. This diagnostic approach is currently \nunder investigation. \n \nConclusion  \n \nThis paper has demonstrated that artificially seeded gear defect detection with AE is \nfraught with difficulties. Experiments to identify seeded defect identification with AE \nr.m.s. and energy were not satisfactory. The influence of oil temperature on AE activity \nhas been presented. This work is part of an ongoing program which aims to further \ninvestigate some of the drawbacks detailed. \n \nReferences \n \n1. Mba, D. and Bannister, R.H. (1999).
