So far\nvarious thin film preparation methods have been explored in\nmany different laboratories, such as pulsed laser deposition,5\ncoevaporation,6 Mg diffusion,7 and molecular beam epitaxy\ngrowth8 with various substrates. A serious common problem\nencountered with MgB2 thin film fabrication is the high post-\ndeposition annealing temperature employed for producing\nhigh Tc superconducting thin films, normally in between 600\nand 950 \u00b0C. Such a high annealing temperature is not desir-\nable for superconductor device fabrication, as high Mg vola-\ntility at temperatures above 600 \u00b0C may lead to possible\nMgB2 phase decomposition and Mg deficiency in the thin\nfilms.9 In fact, compared to a well defined and reproducible\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc for bulk MgB2\nsamples prepared under high pressure with grain size ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 10 mm, the reported Tc values for thin film\nsamples vary from one group to another. It is worth noting\nhere that the most important factors influencing the Tc value\nof polycrystalline thin films might be related to the deposi-\ntion and annealing conditions but independent of the sub-\nstrate materials.

Redistribution subject tproach is of importance for practical applications,\nparticularly an approach with potential for multiple layered\nJosephson junction fabrication.\nHere we describe a MgB2 thin film preparation approach\nusing 80 keV 11B ion implantation into 99% pure commer-\ncial Mg ribbon from Aldrich. The implantation was carried\nout on a versatile 200 kV Danfysik implanter. During the\nimplantation process the estimate Mg target temperature was\nabout 200 \u00b0C with 11B ion beam current about 2 mA. The\nbeam was scanned uniformly over a 200 mm3200 mm area.\nThe total implantation time is about 16 h for an implantation\ndose up to 1018 ions\/cm2. The as implanted samples were\nfollowed by various thermal annealing steps at 500 \u00b0C either\nin flowing Ar or vacuum atmosphere. The formation of\nMgB2 nanocrystalline phase has been examined by cross-\nsectional transmission electron microscope ~XTEM! and Cu\nKa x-ray diffraction ~XRD! measurements and with depth\nchemical composition profiles obtained from 1.5 MeV 4He\nRutherford backscattering spectroscopy ~RBS!. Supercon-\nducting phase transitions were observed by temperature de-\npendent dc magnetization measurement using a Quantum\nDesign MPMS superconducting quantum interference device\n~SQUID! magnetometer with 105\/4p A\/m dc field applied in\nparallel to the ribbon plane for temperatures down to 5 K.\nThe typical dimensions of the Mg ribbon used for XRD,\nRBS, and magnetization measurements are 0.3 mm33 mm\n310 mm. Samples for XTEM observation were prepared by\nAr ion milling at room temperature with the 11B implanted\nMg ribbon sandwiched by Si wafers.\nThe elemental depth profiles were extracted from the\nRBS spectra using Datafurnace code.10 A multiple scattering\ncorrection has been introduced on the Mg signal to ensure a\ncorrect subtraction of the background to the 11B signal, using\nthe procedure developed recently by Barradas, Jeynes, and\nJackson.11 To wield Occam\u2019s razor effectively during the fit-\nting we link the Mg matrix signal with the low sensitivity\nsignals from the light elements by allowing B and O to be\u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n237Appl.

For simplicity of data presentation, only spectra\nfrom one detector are shown here. Fitted partial spectra are\nincluded only for the annealed sample. All commercial Mg\nribbon is oxidized at the surface, but the development of\nfurther oxidation following the thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C\nis dependent on the 11B implantation process. The spectra\nfrom the 11B implanted and annealed sample show only\nslight further oxidation but no significant changes in the 11B\nprofile. In contrast, the spectra from the annealed virgin Mg\nribbon show considerable further oxidation after thermal an-\nnealing at 500 \u00b0C, indicating that the 11B implant acts as a\nvery effective diffusion barrier to oxygen.\nThe elemental depth profiles obtained for the as im-\nplanted sample are shown in Fig. 2. The depth scale is cal-\nculated using linear mixtures of the Mg, MgO, and MgB2\nbulk densities ~1.73, 3.58, and 2.63 g\/cm3, respectively!.\nThere is a region where there is very little free Mg, showing\nthat there is enough B implant to form an almost continuous\nFIG. 1.

Changes in relative diffraction intensi-\nties from standard powder diffraction pattern are due to the\ntextures of the ribbons. One prominent effect of 11B ion im-\nplantation and following thermal annealing to the Mg target\nribbon is the significant change in the preferential texture of\nthe Mg host, due to irradiation damage and regrowth after-\nwards.\nFrom the available Mg\u2013B binary phase diagram,9 the\nmost likely phase that could be formed in the Mg\/B zone\nshould be MgB2 . Direct evidence for the MgB2 phase for-\nmation has been observed from XTEM. The 11B irradiation\ndamage effect to Mg host is clearly shown in Fig. 3~a!. Fig-\nure 3~b! shows the sample after thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C\nfor 15 min, nearly all irradiation damaged Mg has been re-\ncrystallized and MgB2 grains are observed, as indicated by\nthe arrow. The maximum dimension of the MgB2 grain is\nless than 5 nm. All observable MgB2 grains are isolated from\neach other. Figure 3~c! shows the selected area electron dif-\nfraction pattern from the MgB2 grains.\nAll these experimental facts suggest that Mg\/B mixture\nin the as-implanted sample is more or less still in badly dis-\nordered state or even amorphous state. Further growth of\nMgB2 grains can be achieved by a thermal annealing step at\n500 \u00b0C. In fact, weak evidence from XRD for the proper\ngrowth of MgB2 has been observed in a sample annealed at\n500 \u00b0C for 60 min in flowing Ar atmosphere.\nFor all as-implanted samples, it is hard to confirm a well\ndefined superconducting phase transition at temperature\nabove 5 K from dc magnetization measurement, though\nsome of them do show very weak transition steps at various\ntemperatures. Annealing at 500 \u00b0C for 15 min only, a weak\nbut well defined superconducting phase transition has been\nobserved from the dc magnetization measurement. The 11 K\nTc value is considerably lower than the 39 K reported for the\nbulk material. However, further increase in annealing time at\n500 \u00b0C improves the Tc value. A much stronger diamagnetic\nsignal has been observed in samples annealed at 500 \u00b0C for a\nlonger period, e.g., 30 and 60 min, respectively, as shown in\nFig. 4. The XRD patterns for these annealed samples do not\nshow any direct evidence for the formation of MgB2 , an\nindication of very small grain size of MgB2 which is beyond\nthe detection limit of the XRD technique.\nAs all our MgB2 thin films are embedded inside Mg\nribbon with surface layers of MgO, it is worth noting here\nthat special care must be paid to the extraction of the mag-\nnetization signal of MgB2 phase from measured total mag-\nnetization data. Pure bulk Mg is a simple paramagnetic\nmetal, however, diamagnetic behavior has been observed in\nall 11B implanted samples. Such a diamagnetic behavior is\neven enhanced in those 11B implanted samples following\nthermal annealing. As the implanted samples had been sub-\njected to a moderate in situ beam heating during the implan-\ntation process, this diamagnetic behavior might be related to\nthe growth and recrystallization of MgO and formation of\nnanocrystalline Mg particles, as they can exhibit diamagnetic\nbehaviors at low temperature.14 Such a diamagnetic contri-\nbution to the total magnetization from 11B implanted MgDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130. Redistribution subject tribbons might also be the reason for the anomalous high\ntransition temperatures reported in MgB2 previously.15\nThe dependence described earlier of the evolution of the\nsuperconducting phase transition temperature Tc value with\nthe annealing condition clearly shows that the suppressed Tc\nin most of the thin film samples might be related to the small\ngrain size. An extended annealing at low temperature and\noxygen free atmosphere seem necessary to grow big and\ndense MgB2 grains for high Tc transition. This is consistent\nwith high postdeposition annealing temperature reported be-\nfore for the formation of high Tc superconducting phase.\nActually a recent publication on the low temperature synthe-\nsis of superconducting MgB2 reported a 48 h annealing at\n500 \u00b0C for a bulk superconducting sample,16 though the two\nstage transitions observed there had been explained as weak\nlink behavior associated with the grain boundaries.\n1 J.
