INTRODUCTION\nTHE cellular network has been developed and evolvedwell for offering on-demand services to mobile users,\nsuch as voice, short message and Internet access. Nevertheless,\nusers\u2019 growing demands for bandwidth-intensive multimedia\nservices make it more attractive to offer multimedia-on-demand\n(MoD) services to mobile users, such as video-on-demand and\nmusic-on-demand. In the on-demand service mode, a user\nwill place a request for a service directly through the network.\nThe service is then delivered to this user according to the\nuser preference as well as the resource availability and service\nrequirements.\nManuscript received April 6, 2006; revised July 13, 2006.

Hence, a traffic increase implies additional consumption\nof the network resources. In recent years, there has been great\ninterest in utilizing multicast technology in both wired and wire-\nless networks due to its cost-effective transmission [1]\u2013[10].\nUnlike unicast, in multicast, only one copy of data is transmitted\nfrom the source to the multiple recipients in the multicast group.\nTherefore, this leads to less resource consumption in compar-\nison to unicast.\nRecent standardization efforts in wireless networks, such as\nMBMS [11], aim to support multicast in 3G mobile networks\nand the standardization effort of Digital Video Broadcasting\ntransmission system for Handheld terminal (DVB-H) gives an-\nother possibility for utilizing multicast in broadcasting networks\nto handheld devices [12]. In addition, effective cooperation be-\ntween cellular and broadcasting networks enables the cost-ef-\nfective provisioning of on-demand services [13]. In this cooper-\nating system, the 3G networks is used to offer a return channel\nto collect user requests for services, and the DVB network of-\nfers efficient service delivery to users by using multicasting or\nbroadcasting delivery methods. In our previous work, we pro-\nposed an interworking architecture encompassing MBMS and\nDVB networks [14]. Relevant functional entities have also been\ndefined, together with the interfaces, signaling flows and in-\nformation primitives. Although, a lot of conceptual work has\nbeen contributed to achieve efficient multicast-based MoD ser-\nvice provisioning over wireless networks, these efforts have just\nbeen focused on devising effective architecture. In [15], some\ncarousels algorithms have been proposed as a way of data sched-\nuling and delivery in a broadcast system, such as DVB, but they\nare not for on-demand services. The effective algorithms for\nthe optimal on-demand service delivery over wireless networks\nhave not yet been fully investigated.\nIn the research community for wired networks, various\nmethods have been developed to achieve efficient multi-\ncast-based MoD service delivery [1]\u2013[8]. The basic idea is\nto aggregate the requests for a given content arriving over a\ncertain period of time as a group and then serve this group\nwith a single multicast stream. Therefore, such multicast based\nMoD is also called group-based MoD (GMoD). A drawback of\nthe GMoD service model is that a service request may have to\nwait for more requests for the same content to arrive in order\nto share the data stream. A concern is that a user may defect\nif the service set-up delay is kept too long (i.e., renege), and\nhence is lost, constituting a decrease in the revenue and service\nquality. Some aggregation approaches have been proposed\nrecently for making the existing GMoD systems more efficient\n0018-9316\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

System model of the GMoD provisioning.\nand more timely, such as the batching method [1]\u2013[4], the\npiggybacking method [5], and the patching method [6]. These\ntechniques are complementary, and hence can be combined\ninto hybrid strategy to further improve efficiency [7], [8]. Out\nof these methods, the batching method is more computationally\nefficient, and avoids additional resource requirement, such as\nbuffer capacity in the mobile terminals. Therefore, the study\nin this paper focuses on the batching method and attempts to\noptimize this method in a dynamic wireless environment.\nThe two basic batching methods in wireline networks are\nknown as timeout-based batching and size-based batching [1],\ndepending on whether the users are batched for a fixed period of\ntime, or are batched until a sufficient number of requests are col-\nlected. These two basic batching schemes constitute the foun-\ndation for the later extended schemes. For instance, two hy-\nbrid methods have been proposed by Chan [2], namely, com-\nbined-for-profit batching and combined-for-loss batching. Fur-\nthermore, the timeout-based batching scheme has been anal-\nysed from a business perspective in [3]. In both [2] and [3],\nanalytical models were derived for performance evaluation of\nthe timeout-based batching scheme. However, they consider in-\nfinite network resource and study a single content [2], or, the\nuser\u2019s reneging behavior is not considered [3]. Obviously, it is\nsuitable neither for the resource-limited wireless environment,\nnor for practical implementation. In [4], a new batching method,\ncalled delay-aware broadcasting is proposed, making use of the\nexact delay tolerance of each user. This is however difficult to\nimplement due to the difficulty of knowing the user\u2019s true delay\npreference.\nThis paper enhances the traditional analysis models of\nthe basic timeout-based batching scheme by considering the\nblocking probability caused by the limited wireless resource,\nand furthermore we consider multiple contents and the behavior\nof user reneging. Based on these studies, an analytical model is\nderived to study the performance of the timeout-based batching\nscheme. Moreover, we propose a novel optimal timeout-based\nbatching scheme to maximize the percentage of served users\nwith respect to the total users, adaptive to the available re-\nsources and traffic loads in the system. Streaming real-time\napplication is considered in this work as it is envisioned as an\nideal driver for the next generation mobile systems [16].\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, the system model\nand four traditional batching schemes are introduced in\nSection II. In Section III, a theoretical model of the basic\ntimeout-based scheme is presented by considering the blocking\nprobability, reneging probability, user satisfaction ratio and mul-\ntiple contents. Based on this model, our optimal timeout-based\nscheme is proposed. The simulation results are presented and\ndiscussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this\npaper.\nII. REVIEW ON BATCHING SCHEMES\nA. System Model\nThe system model of the GMoD provisioning is illustrated in\nFig. 1.\nThe system provides a set of multimedia contents,\n(e.g., movies, news, music, etc). Each of\nthese contents may have a different popularity and duration.\nAs shown in Fig 1, the request arrival rate of content is\n, , where is the arrival rate of all the users\u2019\nrequests, and is the probability of a request choosing content\n. When the system receives a first user request for a particular\ncontent, it waits for a batching period to collect more requests\nfor the same content, in order to optimize the efficiency of\nresource utilization. Two batching parameters, namely the\nbatching time and the batching size are used to specify\nthe duration of the batching. All the user requests for the same\ncontent are held in a particular batching queue. A drawback\nof the batching is that since users would suffer a delay for the\nservice set-up, some of them may defect if the service latency\nis kept too long (i.e., renege), and hence are lost. Keeping the\nreneging probability low without requiring excessive network\nresources is a great challenge for efficient GMoD service\nprovisioning. After batching ends, some requests will still stay\nin the batching queue, whilst some are lost due to reneging.\nWe use to denote the number of remaining requests for the\ncontent in unit time, which is also called the throughput of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Furthermore, after batching, the system sends a\nresource request for serving the content on behalf of all the\nremaining user requests in the batching queue. This resource\nrequest competes with other resource requests for a limited\nmulticast resource pool containing all the multicast channels\nin a wireless cell. The arrival rate of the resource request for\ncontent is denoted as . If there is a free multicast channel\navailable, the batch of users that sends the resource request is\nserved simultaneously. Otherwise, the batch of users is lost\nfrom the system without being served. The system model will\nbe further explained with a mathematical model in Section III.\nB. Traditional Schemes\nFour batching schemes were proposed in [1], [2]. They are\ntwo basic schemes (timeout-based, size-based) and two hybrid\nschemes (combined-for-profit, combined-for-loss). In these\nschemes, the requests for the same content are batched for a\nspecific batching duration, and then are served with a single\nmulticast stream. This batching duration can be identified by\nthe period of user\u2019s waiting time in the batch (timeout-based\nscheme), the number of users\u2019 requests in the batch (sized-based\nscheme), or by both waiting time and number of requests (hy-\nbrid schemes). In either of these schemes, the batching duration\ncan cause users reneging from their request or the batch due to\nthe delay in content delivery. These four batching schemes are\ndescribed below briefly.\nTimeout-based: batching duration is identified by the period\nof the first user\u2019s waiting time referred to as the batching time\nin order to guarantee the maximum service delay. Requests are\nbatched until the batching time is reached. The timer is set when\na user agrees to wait minutes and the subsequent users for the\nsame content join the waiting line.\nSize-based: batching duration is identified by the number of\nusers referred to as the batching size in order to guarantee\nthe number of users served as a batch. Requests are batched until\nthe batching size threshold is reached. Hence, the user\u2019s waiting\ntime depends on the rate of request arrivals.\nCombined-for-profit \/ loss: batching duration is identified by\nboth of and . In the combined-for-profit scheme, requests\nare batched until both users are collected and the first user\nin the batch waits no less than time. This scheme aims to\nmaximize the \u201cprofit\u201d (e.g., the number of served users). In the\ncombined-for-loss scheme, requests are batched until either\nnumber of users is collected or the first user in the batch has\nwaited time units. This scheme aims to minimize the service\ndelay, thus the reneging probability.\nIII. ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION\nThree metrics of the performance in the basic timeout-based\nscheme will be formulated. They are the reneging probability\n, blocking probability and satisfaction ratio , where\n, and are, respectively, the ratio of the number of\nreneged users due to the delayed service set-up, blocked users\ndue to the insufficient resources and served users, with respect\nto the total number of users in the system. Obviously,\n. Important notations used in this paper are\nsummarized in Table I.\nTABLE I\nIMPORTANT NOTATIONS USED\nA. Analytical Model\nUsers are able to request independent contents according\nto a certain probability. Let be the probability that a request\nchooses content , and let without loss of\ngenerality.\nThe arrivals of users\u2019 requests are assumed to be Poisson\nprocess with a rate of . And each arrival of Poisson can\nselect one of the contents. Therefore, the Poisson can\nbe decomposed into independent Poisson processes: Poisson\n, Poisson and Poisson , each modeling the ar-\nrival of requests for content .\nEach user is willing to wait for a period of time to view\nthe desired content.

The probability of choosing\nthe th content is given by:\n(11)\nwhere, is the parameter that determines the shape of the distri-\nbution. A small corresponds to a more severe discrimination\nof requests among contents and indicates that some contents are\ndesired more frequently than the others. As in [3], is\nassumed in this work.\nTable II shows the default parameter values used in the anal-\nysis and simulation unless otherwise stated.\nB. Simulation Model\nA simulator was constructed using OPNET [19] to jus-\ntify the derived analytical model and evaluate the proposed\noptimal timeout-based batching scheme by comparing with\nfour conventional batching schemes, namely, two traditional\nbasic schemes (timeout-based, size-based) and two traditional\nhybrid schemes (combined-for-profit, combined-for-loss). The\nassumption in the analytical model is adopted by the simulation\nmodel unless otherwise stated. This simulator consists of a\nwireless cell (e.g., DVB cell) with limited available multicast\nradio channels. Users are uniformly distributed in the cell.\nEach user randomly sends a request for a particular content at\nany one time. The duration of the content is determined based\non an Exponential distribution. We consider a mixed traffic\nscenario where the GMoD service and the other services (e.g.,\nTV broadcasting and datacasting) share and compete for a\ncommon and limited resource pool. As a result, the network\nresource available for the GMoD service fluctuates over time,\nas denoted by C multicast channels.\nC. Analytical Results\nBoth the results obtained from computer simulations and\nanalytical model are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the\nperformance depends highly on the selection of batching time\n.

Therefore, we set as\na priority constraint to . In our optimal batching scheme,\nthe is optimized to maximize the satisfaction ratio subject\nto constraints of the maximum (5%) and (30%).\nIV. EVALUATION OF OPTIMAL TIMEOUT-BASED SCHEME\nA. Algorithm Parameters\nWe evaluate the proposed optimal timeout-based batching\nscheme by simulation. In the simulation, the optimal batching\ntime adapts to the time varying resource availability and re-\nquest arrival rate. Two experiments are performed with respect\nto different values of the user\u2019s mean waiting time (i.e., 10\nminutes and 3 minutes). The mapping tables with different\nare presented in Table III and Table IV respectively. Each map-\nping table contains the mapping of number of available channels\nand request arrival rate to the optimal batching time . As a\nresult, if the number of available channels is low, the batching\ntime is set as long as possible to improve resource utilization\nby merging enough users in a group. Otherwise, the system\nwill shorten the batching time in order to avoid too many users\nreneging from the batch. In contrast, given a certain number of\navailable channels , the batching time does not change much\nfor a wide range of . In addition, comparing Table III and\nTable IV, it can be seen that a smaller is applied to a smaller\n, under the same conditions. Furthermore, for a smaller , more\navailable channels are required so as to meet the constraint re-\nquirements of and at the same time.\nIn the traditional batching schemes (i.e., the basic and hy-\nbrid schemes), the resource constraint is not considered. Their\nbatching parameters, namely batching time and batching size\n, are chosen from its respective constituent batching schemes\n(i.e., in the basic timeout-based scheme and in the basic\nsize-based scheme) \u201coptimized\u201d independently for a target ar-\nrival rate and remain constant for other rates [2]. Therefore,\nwe can characterize these traditional schemes as static resource\nmanagement [21] in the sense that their batching parameters do\nnot adapt to the variation of actual system status, such as the re-\nsource availability.\nWe evaluate the traditional schemes in a scenario where the\ncell capacity is limited, and moreover, the available resources\nare time-varying. The batching parameters of traditional\nschemes are configured based on the target user request arrival\nrate and the heaviest load of background traffic in the cell, as\nthe methodology employed by the static resource allocation\n[22] in traditional cellular networks.\nB.

This is because the\noptimal scheme chooses the most appropriate batching time for\neach so as to maximize . In contrast, in traditional schemes,\nthe batching parameters are dimensioned for the worst case\n(i.e., smallest ). These parameters result in a longer batching\nduration, which is not appropriate for non-worst case . In\naddition, it can be seen that mainly depends on . This\nis because is so small that the is dominant over the\nto determine the .\nFig. 7(b) shows that the optimal scheme improves as\ngets larger by choosing shorter batching time. However,\nthe traditional schemes use the same batching parameters (i.e.,\nbatching time and batching size) as varies. Hence, the user\u2019s\nwaiting time and thereby keeps constant in relation to .\nIn other words, it is not optimized and improved with respect\nto . In addition, it can be seen that for all investigated values\nof , the combined-for-loss scheme outperforms the other tra-\nditional schemes in reducing , especially, at the worst case\n(i.e., ), it outperforms the optimal scheme\nin terms of . This is because of the extra consideration of\nthe batching size that is used together with the batching time to\nlimit the batching duration in the combined-for-loss scheme.\nAs a result, the batching duration is reduced compared to the\nother schemes.\nFig. 7(c) shows that although the two basic schemes and the\ncombined-for-profit scheme give lower than the optimal\nscheme, the optimal scheme still keeps under 0.05 for all\ninvestigated . In addition, it can be observed that the curve of\nthe optimal scheme shows two peaks at and . As\nseen in Table III, these peaks appear when the optimal batching\ntime changes.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper studied five batching schemes including four tra-\nditional schemes and one proposed novel approach to enable\nthe resource efficient MoD service delivery in resource-lim-\nited wireless networks. We derived an analytical model for the\nperformance evaluation of basic timeout-based scheme consid-\nering some practical wireless resource constraints. We found\nthat there is a tradeoff between the blocking probability and the\nreneging probability. Also we found that there exists an optimal\nbatching time that can strike this balance. Furthermore it was\nfound that the change of request arrival rate has no much im-\npact on the system performance, such as the satisfaction ratio,\nblocking and reneging probability, especially when the request\narrival rate is high. On the other hand, the change of available\nresources gives different optimal batching time.\nAn optimal timeout-based scheme was proposed based on\nthis analytical model to maximize the satisfaction ratio. In this\napproach, the batching duration time adapts to a certain system\nstatus characterized by service quality constraints, traffic infor-\nmation, user profile and resource availability. Simulation re-\nsults showed improved performance using the proposed optimal\nscheme when the system status varies. In addition, we re-evalu-\nated the traditional batching schemes, but this time with wireless\nresource limitation also being considered. Our results show that\nto maximize the satisfaction ratio, when the request arrival rate\nchanges, the basic timeout-based scheme outperforms the other\ntraditional schemes, while the combined-for-loss is better than\nthe other traditional schemes as the available resource changes.\nThe proposed optimal scheme provides a superior solution to\nservice providers or network operators to offer multicast-based\nMoD service over resource-limited wireless networks. Further-\nmore, under varying resource limitations, service providers\nand network operators can still get superior performance by\nadapting the batching time to the changes accordingly so as\nto make an optimal balance between blocking users and users\nreneging, in other words, between profitability and quality of\nservice.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work reported in this paper has formed a part of the IoN\nWork Area of the Core 3 Research Programme of the Virtual\nCenter of Excellence in Mobile & Personal Communications,\nMobile VCE, www.mobilevce.com, whose funding support, in-\ncluding that of EPSRC, is gratefully acknowledged.
