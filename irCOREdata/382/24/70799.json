We argue that this is entirely appropriate for applied \nethnography that is conducted in pursuit of explicit design goals. In this paper, we \nexplore the relationship between pure and applied ethnography, and their use in \ncognitive and social research. We also discuss how the outcomes of applied \nethnography can be applied to i) the design of a computer-based design support tool \nand ii) the development of controlled experimental studies that retain sufficient \necological validity to capture realistic design expertise. We additionally argue that \nobjectivity in empirical studies of design can be obtained only by triangulating \nobservations across methodologies that embrace both ethnographic and laboratory-\nbased traditions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 3 \n \nKeywords: Engineering Design; Ethnography; Design Support; Expertise; \nDesign Re-Use; Design Rationale \n \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 4 \nThe use of ethnographic methods in design research has proliferated in recent years\n1-4\n \nsince the seminal research of Suchman\n5\n and Lave\n6\n which affirmed the importance of \nstudying real-world problem-solving and planning behaviours as situated practices. It \noften appears, however, that there is only a limited overlap between the approaches \ntaken by design researchers employing what they term ethnographic methods and the \nethnographic techniques that have formed the basis of much traditional \nanthropological and sociological research. In this paper we argue that this disparity is \nan inevitable consequence of the purposes for which ethnographic methods are being \nused. For example, the pursuit of a relatively pure form of ethnography would seem \nentirely appropriate in anthropological or sociological studies in which the focus is \nthat of gaining insights into previously unexplored cultures or undocumented social \npractices. In design contexts, however, it is apparent that the goals of research tend to \nbe more applied in nature, such as attempting to understand design behaviours in \norder to make design productivity more effective (e.g., through computer-based \nsupport or changes to existing organisational practices). It is these variations in \npurpose which we believe motivate ethnographic studies of design to differ - at times \nquite markedly - from more traditional ethnographies. \n In the remainder of this paper, we first briefly review the characteristics of \npure ethnography as espoused by those using the method in anthropological and \nsociological research, and discuss how applied ethnography borrows from some of \nthese characteristics whilst deliberately challenging others. The arguments that we \nmake in this section build upon points we have made elsewhere (see Ball & \nOrmerod\n7\n) where we introduce  the possibility of developing  a \u2018cognitive \nethnography\u2019 of design. In subsequent sections of the paper we describe how we have \nemployed ethnographic methods in two contexts: first in studying the processes of \ndesign re-use in a major aeronautics company in order to inform the development of a \ndesign-support tool, and second, in collecting materials for subsequent cognitive \nexperimental research into design expertise in a major software development \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 5 \ncompany. The focus of this paper is methodological rather than empirical, so we do \nnot offer lengthy descriptions of ethnographic data and their interpretation, instead \nchoosing to focus upon the potential strengths of a clearly specified applied \nethnographic method. \n \n1.  \u2018Pure\u2019 ethnography versus \u2018applied\u2019 ethnography \nThere is no doubt that ethnography has the potential to play a valuable role in design \nresearch. First, the complex, ongoing and multi-faceted nature of commercial design \nprojects excludes the use of experimental research methods since such factors do not \nreadily lend themselves to experimental control. Second, the fact that much real-world \ndesign is situated within  a rich and dynamic social context not only adds new \ncomplexities to any attempt to achieve experimental rigour, but also obviates the use \nof non-experimental techniques such as verbal protocol analysis (Ericsson & Simon\n8\n) \nwhich are solely geared toward understanding individual behaviours in socially-\nimpoverished contexts. Third, the observation (e.g., Boden\n9\n) that much important \ndecision making and negotiation within organisations takes place through incidental \nmeetings outside of the nominal work area (e.g., in canteens, corridors and doorways) \nmeans that any empirical technique should have some capacity to track such ad hoc \nencounters as well as the more standard, scheduled interactions. \n The importance of ethnography as an emerging method in design research is \nclearly attested to by the burgeoning number of published studies purporting to have \nused ethnographic methods. We have, however, argued elsewhere (see Ball & \nOrmerod\n7\n) that such studies are often using a methodology that is distinct from the \nkinds of ethnography employed in traditional anthropological and sociological \nresearch, whilst still retaining some of the key features of such ethnographies. In \nsupport of this view, we have proposed that ethnography may best be understood as a \nradial category which exhibits prototype effects (see Lakoff\n10\n). Radial categories \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 6 \nencompass a central, prototypical case as well as a number of variations from this \nprototype. The prototypical case can then be viewed as a template against which one \nmay examine other instances in order to assess their goodness-of-fit to the prototype. \nUnder this conceptualisation it is possible for a case of ethnography to differ from the \nprototype in terms of qualitative or quantitative omissions in relation to one or more \nattributes of the prototype. \n Our starting point for defining a prototypical case of ethnography has involved \nsystematically examining the relatively pure forms of ethnography as espoused in \nstandard textbooks and anthropological monographs\n11-12\n as well as research papers \ndiscussing this method.\n13-16\n From this literature review we have found that there \nappear to be ten consistently occurring features which exemplify a prototypical \nethnography (see Table 1). Note that the category is radial in the sense that we would \nnot expect every instance of an ethnography to conform precisely to these listed \nfeatures but simply to retain the flavour of a majority of them. Such prototypical \nethnographic methods are very closely identified with those of traditional \nanthropologists whose goal is primarily that of developing a personalised \nunderstanding of the rituals and customs of a society, culture or organisation for the \nadvancement of knowledge per se. In such pure ethnographies the levels of \nsubjectivity, reflexivity and self-reflection are high, observational openness and \nindependence are paramount, and the intensity is extreme (some anthropological \nethnographies last many years). \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 about here \n----------------------------------------- \n What is noticeable, however, when one examines existing design research \nwhich has purported to use ethnographic techniques, is that almost all such studies \nviolate a significant subset of the characteristics of a prototypical ethnography, either \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 7 \nby omission or by satisfying certain characteristics to only a weak degree. Two \nexamples of published research which claim to be using ethnographic techniques may \nserve to illustrate such contraventions to traditional ethnography: Bucciarelli\u2019s\n17\n \n\u2018ethnographic perspective on engineering design\u2019 and Lloyd and Deasley\u2019s\n4\n \n\u2018ethnographic description of design networks\u2019. \n  Bucciarelli\u2019s research is based around studies of two engineering firms. One \ncompany was involved in making photovoltaic modules for the conversion of solar \nradiation into electricity, and the other was engaged in the production of X-ray \nequipment for a variety of purposes including medical diagnostics, the quality control \nof materials production, and baggage inspection. Data collection was exclusively by \nmeans of field notes. Comparing Bucciarelli's research with the characteristics of a \ntraditional ethnography illuminates a number of interesting counterpoints. To begin \nwith, Bucciarelli gives no indication of the duration of his two studies - although one \ngets the impression that neither were especially lengthy. Indeed the most detailed \naspect of his data which he discusses (relating to the nature of design discourse) \npertain to observations deriving from three project meetings. As such, the research \nseems to violate the intensity of a traditional ethnography. In addition, whilst \nBucciarelli claims a high degree of openness in his data collection - which is indeed \nmarked by a strong inclusiveness in terms of the breadth of players who are viewed as \nrelevant to the design process and the  variety of activities observed -  it is evident that \nhe has entered his ethnography with some very strong pre-conceptions of what design \nis and what it is not.. For example, he is up-front with the views that \u2018designing is \nmore than a cognitive process . . . Design, even though done by engineers is not a \nmechanical process . . . design is not rational in the managerial or economist\u2019s sense\u2019  \n(pp 5-6). Instead, in entering his ethnographic analysis with the clear mind-set \u2018that \ndesign is a social process\u2019 (p 6) he appears to be explicitly contravening the \nethnographic principal of independence from prior theory.  Finally, there is no \nobvious evidence to suggest that Bucciarelli achieved the true status of a participant \nobserver within the design process, which questions the quality of his locatedness \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 8 \nwithin the community of practitioners he studied as well as the mutuality he achieved \nwith his observees.   \n In spite of its apparent divergence from a traditional form of ethnography, \nBucciarelli\u2019s ethnography of design still allowed for the construction of a vivid, multi-\nlayered picture of the commercial design process which is illuminated by the \nidentification of three intriguing themes. First, the concept of \u2018object worlds\u2019 is \ninvoked to describe the different design spaces (mechanical, geometric, \nelectromagnetic,  managerial etc.) and associated symbol systems that are allied to the \nvarious stakeholders in the design situation. Second, the concept of \u2018specifications \nand constraints\u2019 is used to discuss the types of facts and laws that rule over the \ndesigner\u2019s practices and limit their development of design solutions. Third, the notion \nthat design discourse is developed into an account of the importance of negotiation \nfrom different viewpoints during the design and production of artefacts.   \n The theme of negotiation is also of paramount importance to Lloyd and \nDeasley\n4\n in relation to their three-month ethnographic study of social processes in an \naerospace design team pursuing a 10-year project. Data collection was by means of \nfield notes (since Ministry of Defence regulations prevented audio recording) and \ninvolved interviews, analysis of formal documentation, and direct observations of the \nactivity of the electronic design engineers (this latter phase of activity absorbed three \nweeks of the full study period). Like Bucciarelli\u2019s study, the intensity of Lloyd and \nDeasley\u2019s ethnography is rather less than that of a traditional ethnography. In addition, \nthe reality of their participant observer status is questionable, and their a priori focus \non understanding social networks of negotiation in design teams means that their \nstudy was in breach of a full degree of openness and independence. Again, though, the \nvalue of the work is readily manifest in the interesting findings that it produced. For \nexample, there was good evidence that informal social structures were determining \nthe effectiveness of work activity. In addition, the use of subtle role-playing in \nproblem-solving was identified as an important aspect of the design process. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 9 \n The only ethnographic study of design that we have come across which does \nnot violate the feature of a prototypical ethnography is Woolgar\u2019s\n18\n company-based \nexploration of the processes underpinning the design and production of a new range of \nmicro-computers, which is robust on all ten features and reads as a true ethnography \nin terms of its narrative richness, socio-cultural locatedness, and epistemological \nrelativism. In our view, the observation that most ethnographies of design diverge \nfrom a central case is not something which should be seen as making the research \ndeficient in some way. Indeed, we would argue that systematic differences from the \nfeature list shown in Table 1 are both a necessity and a strength of ethnographic \nstudies of design for both practical and theoretical reasons. To support this view, we \ninvoke the idea that the principal factor that motivates ethnographies of design to \ndiffer from a central prototype is that they are purposive in ways that traditional \nethnographies are not. In particular, almost all ethnographic studies of design that we \nare familiar with seem to be motivated toward the pursuit of applied goals such as \nthose of providing support to aspects of design cognition (e.g., through technology-\nbased assistance) or improvements to the social milieu of design teams (e.g., through \norganisational changes and interventions). \n \n2. The characteristics of applied ethnography \nThe way in which such applied goals lead to the violation of the characteristics of a \nprototypical ethnography are subtle and multi-faceted, and we therefore only \nsummarise three key contraventions here to illustrate our basic argument. \n First, the often extreme intensity of traditional ethnographic data collection is \nunlikely to be cost-effective - and may even be impossible - for most design-research \nprojects. Pursuing applied objectives typically brings with it the need to understand \nskilled behaviours within short time frames in order to effect improvements as quickly \nas possible. This factor, coupled with the inevitable limitations that are placed on \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 10 \naccessing designers owing to management perceptions that work is being interrupted, \nmeans that observational intensity will tend to be diluted in favour of temporal \nspecificity, whereby the researcher samples snap-shots of ongoing behaviour over \nshort-term company visits of days, weeks, or at  most a few months. \n Second, the high degree of independence of traditional ethnographic data \nacquisition and analysis seems inappropriate in applied contexts. Whilst traditional \nethnographies strive to remain unencumbered by existing theoretical frameworks and \nclassificatory systems, applied ethnographies often require a strong element of \nhypothesis testing and theory-driven observation. For example, the specification of a \nnew technological system or the revision of existing work practices are both \nendeavours that come laden with (often implicit)  hypotheses that require testing. Note \nthat the need for applied ethnographies to be at least partly theory driven does not \nexclude some role for genuine openness  in their research. Indeed, the applied \nethnographer\u2019s sensitivity to adventitious findings or unexpected observations is a \nvaluable resource for generating novel research hypotheses. In this way, applied \nethnography retains a degree of independence which makes it distinct from many \nother forms of empirical analysis.  \n Third, the personalisation associated with traditional ethnographies, which \ntypically revolve around first-person story-telling in relation to people\u2019s historical and \ncultural endowments, presents a potentially severe problem in applied research owing \nto the clear lack of verifiability of the outcomes of the analysis. It is important to note, \nfor example, that systems development work in design contexts is inevitably \nexpensive for sponsors, who will quite legitimately be keen to know that the findings \nderiving from empirical analyses are firmly grounded in relatively objective data. This \nstrong emphasis on verifiability is central to an applied ethnography that can allow for \nthe replication of findings by other observers as well as the validation of results \nthrough a process of methodological triangulation. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 11 \n One key characteristic of this concept of applied ethnography that we have \ndeveloped so far is that it has no specific allegiance to any overarching \nepistemological framework for interpreting and explaining human behaviours and \npractices. It is possible, however, to add such explanatory frameworks (e.g., those \nderiving from cognitive science or social psychology) to the concept of applied \nethnography in such a way as to produce fields of enquiry that fall within the remit of, \nfor example, an \u2018applied cognitive ethnography\u2019 or an \u2018applied social ethnography\u2019. \nIndeed, much of our own ethnographic research on design, whilst being motivated \ntoward applied goals such as the  computer-based support of information storage and \nretrieval, is also firmly located within a cognitive-science tradition. As such, the focus \nof our research is typically that of understanding aspects of process, structure and \nrepresentation that are inherently mental in nature. \n Whilst the interpretative frame of reference for an applied cognitive \nethnography would relate to the fine-grained explanation of cognitive phenomena \nwith recourse to information-processing constructs, that for an applied social \nethnography might well relate to the explanation of phenomena in terms of processes \nof social construction. Taking these arguments a step further, we see no reason why a \ncognitive scientist could not use ethnographic methods in non-applied research aimed \nat the advancement of a basic understanding of cognitive phenomena, thereby simply \nundertaking a \u2018cognitive ethnography\u2019. In making these observations, however, we are \nnot aiming to promulgate a whole set of new terminology for describing different \nforms of ethnography but are rather attempting to illustrate the ways in which \nethnographies of design may not only diverge form a prototypical ethnography but \nmay also exhibit distinctive flavours because of differences of purpose and theoretical \ngrounding. Our key argument is that it is typically the applied goals of design \nethnographies that drive their divergence from a prototypical case. \n \n3. The use of applied ethnography in specifying a design support tool \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 12 \nIn this section we illustrate the value of applying ethnography in design research with \nreference to a three-year research project  that we are currently pursuing which is \naimed at supporting design \u2018re-use\u2019 in innovative engineering contexts through \nintelligent, computer-based support. Re-use refers to the process by which previously \nencountered design information (e.g., that relating to performance criteria, solution \noptions, evaluative critiques and the like) is re-invoked by designers when they are \ntackling a current problem. Existing empirical evidence\n19-21\n suggests that previous \ndesign concepts do frequently get re-used in relation to routine design tasks that are \ncharacterised by well-defined design problems where known solutions can be re-\napplied. To date, however, little is known about the nature and extent of information \nre-use in more innovative design situations of the kind that prevail in the conceptual \nphases of much design work. Designers often tell us that re-use plays only a minimal \nrole in their innovative design work. However, it remains possible that the adaptation \nof previous design information could make cost-effective use of design effort during \ninnovative design activity (e.g., through the encoding and later retrieval of innovative \ndesign ideas that were not technologically feasible at time of generation but that gain \napplicability over time).  \n Such inadequacies in our understanding of re-use activities in innovative \ndesign contexts make it difficult to know how best to go about facilitating or \nenhancing information re-use through technological support. This lack of knowledge \nformed the starting point for the development of the computer-based system for \nindexing re-use information which we commenced two years ago. This system, called \nDESPERADO (DESign Process Encoding and Retrieval by Agent Designated Objects \n- Ormerod et al.\n22\n), has involved two parallel research strands. First, on the empirical \nside, we have been using ethnographic methods to investigate the re-use practices of \ndesign teams working on conceptual design tasks in large scale commercial design \nsettings. Second, on the computational side, we have been applying ideas from object-\noriented programming  in the development of DESPERADO\u2019s underlying \nfunctionality. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 13 \n The inherently applied objectives of our empirical work readily illustrate the \nway in which our ethnography had to deviate from a pure form of traditional \nethnography. For example, since we knew that we would have to begin the \nspecification and prototyping of DESPERADO in the second year of the project it was \nquite clear that the intensity of a traditional ethnography would have to be sacrificed \nin favour of a high degree of observational specificity. In addition, there were two key \nfactors which impacted upon the need for our ethnography to have a strong element of \nverifiability. First, the fact that DESPERADO had to meet the needs of end-users \nmeant that we had to develop a well-specified and testable account of design re-use \nthat captured both generalities across different companies and contexts as well as \nteam-specific practices within such companies and contexts. Second, we needed to be \nable to assure our sponsors - and our intended users of DESPERADO - that we had \nrobust theoretical grounds on which to develop the system. Finally, the purposive \nnature our data collection (i.e., the goal of the empirical work was to elicit \nrequirements for the development of DESPERADO) meant that it was necessary to \nhave some notion of the kinds of data that we needed to obtain prior to the actual \ncommencement of our studies. Specifying the type of data that one is aiming to collect \nin a priori manner clearly compromises the independence of an ethnography, and, to \nsome extent, its openness and richness. \n There were, in fact, three particular considerations that dictated the scope of \nour ethnographic data collection and analysis. First, we needed to identify the \nprimitive units  of re-use in terms of the basic kinds of information that get re-invoked \nand adapted during design. Such an understanding was an essential aspect of the \nrequirements specification for DESPERADO since the system would need to base its \nfunctioning around these primitive elements of re-use  - or what we subsequently refer \nto as design \u2018episodes\u2019. Second, we needed to explore the process of natural re-use in \norder to gain insights into designers\u2019 strategies for encoding information for \nsubsequent re-use and for retrieving information for current re-use. This knowledge \nwas important for informing the specification of DESPERADO\u2019s system-initiated \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 14 \nencoding and retrieval functioning. Third, we needed to acquire an understanding of \nthe situated nature of re-use practices such as the antecedents and sequelae of re-use. \nIn this respect, evidence for sub-optimal re-use practices (e.g.,  tendencies to fix \nrigidly on single solution options) would clarify the way in which DESPERADO \nmight operate so as to optimise design activity. \n \n3.1. Collecting the data  to inform system development \nIn order to collect data that addressed our themes of interest we conducted short \nethnographic studies in our four end user companies - which were all major \ninternational leaders in the respective fields of telecommunications, computer \nsystems, industrial design  and aerospace. Because of space considerations we will  \nlimit our discussion in this section to the study undertaken in the aerospace company, \nsince the data from this study revealed some of the best illustrative examples of \ngeneric findings that informed the design specification for of DESPERADO. \n Prior to the study we held several short meetings over a six-month period with \nthe managers and selected members of the design team. This phase enabled us to set \nup the study and to negotiate when, and under which terms, our researcher could \nobserve the design group. In addition, these meetings proved extremely useful in \nfacilitating the early capture of basic background information that allowed us to gain \nfamiliarity with the design domain of the end-user group. \n Our researcher spent a consecutive two-week period with the aerospace design \ngroup in the role of a participant observer, in that whilst she did not contribute directly \nto the design work she was frequently involved in design discussions - often offering \nopinions and informal assessments of design ideas. The researcher was given a desk \nin the main design room of the team which was a large open-plan office with limited \nphysical divisions between desks. She was allowed to observe the work of individual \ndesigners and was permitted to sit in on team meetings and design-review discussions. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 15 \nThe researcher also conducted several informal and unstructured interviews with \ndesign team members on a primarily one-to-one basis. Data collection consisted \nexclusively of field notes that detailed the activities and behaviours observed by the \nresearcher as well as the key content of verbal communications. These observational \ndata were supplemented with notes detailing the researcher\u2019s comments upon, and \nfeelings toward, the events and situations that were experienced.  \n \n3.2. Using the data to inform the development of DESPERADO \nAs stated above, we set out to address three key issues; namely, the primitive units of \ndesign re-use, the process of re-use, and situating re-use in ongoing design practices. \nOur ethnographic observations have had profound effects upon the design of \nDESPERADO in each of these areas, which we briefly describe below. \n In attempting to specify the nature and size of re-use primitives our design of \nDESPERADO was initially guided by the Questions, Options and Criteria (QOC) \nformalism for capturing design rationale developed by MacLean, Young, Bellotti and \nMoran\n23\n. Questions  describe key design issues, Options  describe possible solutions \nto design problems, and Criteria describe approaches to assessing options. However, \nit rapidly transpired from inspection of the ethnographic transcripts that designers do \nnot segment questions, criteria and options in ongoing work.  Instead, they are worked \nupon in parallel, in what we have described as a focus constellation. This is in some \nrespects fortuitous, since shifts in question focus, which signal the boundaries of a \nfocus constellation, appear from the data to be a seemingly natural transition point \nbetween episodes. Thus, we took the data from the aerospace company and sectioned \nit into 50 episodes that we have subsequently used to \u2018seed\u2019 the DESPERADO \ndatabase for company trials of the system. These episodes, with few exceptions, offer \nre-use information based around the pursuit of a focus constellation by one or more \ndesigners at a point in time. Segmenting design episodes by focus constellation \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 16 \naffords considerable advantages since DESPERADO is now able to support \nstructured, goal-oriented shifts in activity which we have elsewhere argued (Ball & \nOrmerod\n24\n) are a hallmark of design expertise. Furthermore, we make explicit the \nelicitation of design rationale (e.g., MacLean et al\n23\n) through the encoding of a focus \nconstellation. \n Analyses of the ethnographic data have produced insights into the processes \nunderlying design re-use. Most strikingly, we have seen little evidence of systematic \nencoding or retrieval practices based around external repositories, though there is \nmuch evidence of unsystematic storage (and consequent failure to retrieve). Instead, \ninformation re-use arises primarily from individuals recalling information from \nmemory.  This observation has led us to alter our views on encoding in \nDESPERADO. Our initial conception, of encoding as a task to be removed from \ndesigners where possible, has been replaced by a view of encoding as integral to \ndelivering both indexing for re-use and the construction of a design rationale. Thus, \ninstead of attempting to embody inappropriate natural encoding practices, we have \nrefined the DESPERADO interface to make explicit the designer\u2019s encoding role, and \nto support encoding though interface features (e.g., system prompts, defaults and \nprocedurally-oriented displays). This change is justifiable on the grounds that, whilst \ndesigners may be reluctant to undertake encoding activity in an unsupported \nenvironment where the purpose of encoding is not explicit, the added value gained \nfrom achieving both indexing and design rationale is sufficiently compelling to \nundertake the task within a supportive environment. \n Perhaps the most striking influence of our ethnographic analysis was upon our \nunderstanding of situating re-use within design practices. Prior to our ethnographic \nstudies, we had conducted a large body of studies using the traditional protocol \nanalytic methods of cognitive psychology, to explore the nature of design expertise \n(e.g., Ball Evans, Dennis & Ormerod\n25\n; Ball, Maskill & Ormerod\n26\n).  A general \nconclusion from these studies was that even highly skilled designers, when working \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 17 \nindividually on both small- and large-scale design problems, can be seen to exhibit \n\u2018satisficing\u2019 behaviours. However, fine-grained analyses of our ethnographic data \nhave revealed unexpected re-use strategies in team design. The results are particularly \nstriking in that they contrast so markedly with our previous studies of individual \ndesign activity. In particular, specific team members (e.g., the project manager) bring \nto bear strategies aimed directly at avoiding premature commitment to single solution \noptions. This finding has led to a reconceptualisation of the role of DESPERADO. \nOur previous view of the system acting as a passive \u2018servant\u2019 in support of the tasks \nof encoding and retrieval of design re-use information has been replaced by a view of \nDESPERADO as an active \u2018surrogate manager\u2019 that oversees episode traversal during \nunmanaged design activity, and prompts designers to retrieve previous episodes when \nthere is a danger of satisficing behaviour emerging in individual design work. \n  \n4. Using applied ethnography in supporting naturalistic experimentation \nSo far in this paper we have discussed how ethnography can be modified in pursuit of \npurposive goals that underlie design activity. Whilst applied ethnography differs from \na radial category of pure ethnography, both approaches remain faithful to a non-\ninterventionist research tradition. Most cognitive psychology, on the other hand, is of \nan interventionist nature, gaining its strength from the systematic manipulation and \ncontrol of variables that might affect performance. Examples of the successful use of \nan interventionist experimental methodology to explore natural practices and \nexpertise in design are few and far between. This is hardly surprising given the \ncomplexity of the domain, and the obvious difficulties associated with attempting the \nrigorous control of the majority of factors that might affect design in pursuit of the \nexploration of a limited subset. Attempts to use experimental methods to explore \ndesign immediately confront the problem of ecological validity (e.g., Neisser\n27\n); put \nsuccinctly, the methods used to study performance in any domain must maintain a \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 18 \nsufficient degree of authenticity that the researcher can have confidence in the \ngeneralisation of their findings beyond the controlled conditions of the laboratory. \n In the face of the problem of ecological validity, one might question whether \ncontrolled experimentation has any role to play in design research. We suggest that it \ndoes. This role is perhaps best illustrated in the use of controlled experimentation for \nfunctionality and usability testing of products and prototypes (e.g., Lansdale & \nOrmerod\n28\n). The big pay off from controlled experimentation is that it offers a high \ndegree of objectivity in observation and interpretation. When one needs assurance (as \nin the case of testing whether a product, component or process satisfies a requirements \nspecification), then controlled experimentation meets this need. Similar requirements \nfor objective assurance face the researcher in developing theories of design expertise, \naccounts of optimal design practice, or tools and methods for supporting design.  \n Although ethnographic methods provide rich and naturalistic data for \necologically valid research, they face the inevitable criticism that observations are \nopen to subjective sampling and interpretation. Ethnographers might raise a number \nof arguments against this criticism, for example by pointing to the skilled nature of \nethnography, the potential for achieving validation through intensive observation, and \npossibly even the false assumptions that underlie claims of objectivity in controlled \nexperimentation. Rather than try to defend ethnography from this criticism, we see a \ndifferent resolution to the problem of introducing objectivity into design research. We \nsuggest that this can best achieved through a process of triangulation  across research \nmethodologies. Triangulation, that is, the support of an observation or interpretation \nby providing converging evidence from a number of different sources, has been \nsuggested as an important component of the ethnographic method. However, typically \nthe different sources of evidence come from within the same ethnographic study and \nrely upon the same methodology for their capture. To achieve an acceptable degree of \nresearch objectivity, we argue that triangulation must be based upon convergence \nacross different research methodologies. This is made possible in our research \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 19 \nbecause applied ethnography plays a unique role in enhancing the ecological validity \nof controlled experimentation in design research. Thus, outcomes from studies \ninvolving ethnographic and laboratory-based methods can be triangulated whilst \nmaintaining ecological validity of the research. \n \n4.1 Sorting - an experimental method that benefits from ethnography \nOne experimental technique that has been used to some effect in exploring design \nexpertise, but that suffers from problems of low ecological validity, is the sort method \n(e.g., Hoffman, Shadbolt, Burton & Klein\n29\n). In this method, participants are given \nsets of cards that contain descriptions pertaining to different aspects of a domain, and \nare required to sort these into categories according to one or more dimensions that \nappear important or significant to the participant. The method originates in \nexperimental research into human memory and the mental representation of \nconceptual categories (e.g., Rosch\n30\n). The rationale of the method is that, by \nexamining the nature of the sorts produced by participants (notably the dimensions \nused to define categories, the assignment of domain objects to different categories, \nand the order in which category dimensions are produced), one can infer participants\u2019 \nmental representations of conceptual knowledge. In applied research, one typically \nmakes this inference on the basis of studying expert\/novice differences in sorting \nperformance. For example, Davies, Gilmore and Green\n31 \nused a sort method to \nexplore the naturalness of different computer program descriptions. They found that \nsorts produced by expert programmers reflected functional rather than object-oriented \ngroups, a finding that runs counter to the assumed naturalness of object-oriented \ndescriptions of programming concepts.  \n It has been suggested by some authors (e.g., Burton, Shadbolt, Rugg, & \nHedgecock\n32\n) that the sort method provides an equally informative but more cost-\neffective method for eliciting accounts of expertise, for example in the development \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 20 \nof expert systems, than traditional observational methods such as the analysis of \nverbal protocols. However, the sort method is not without its problems. In much of \nthe early psychological research into conceptual categories, there was an assumption \nthat what was being elicited through a sort method reflected relatively static \nconceptual representations. This is certainly the assumption that underlies the use of \nthe sort method by applied researchers (e.g., Adelson\n33\n; McKeithen et al\n34\n). However, \nthis view of static conceptual representations has been challenged by Barsalou\u2019s\n35 \ndescription of goal-directed categories. In this view, categories and their members are \nnot fixed, but are determined by the task faced by the individual at any one time. If \nthis view is correct, then an assumption that one can use a sort method to elicit static \nrepresentations of conceptual knowledge about design is unfounded. \n One particular problem facing the use of the sort method in design research \nconcerns the nature of the items to be sorted. In traditional sort tasks, the items consist \nof object descriptions, often varying in familiarity, representativeness, or \nprototypicality. In applied research, they may contain descriptions of domain objects \nor terminology (e.g., programs - Davies et al.\n31\n; programming commands and syntax - \nMcKeithen et al.\n34\n; photographs of archaeological shards - Burton et al.\n32\n). However, \nit is in the selection of items for sorting that the method can lose ecological validity. \nFor example, if concepts are goal-directed as Barsalou\n35 \nsuggests, then the sorts that \ndesigners produce are likely to be a function of the items they are given to sort. \nSpecifically, designers are likely to treat items that are presented as representative of \ndomain terminology in qualitatively different ways than items that contain the \ninformation that they themselves have developed or been involved with. To date, we \nare unaware of any studies employing the sort method that have used items produced \nby the study participants themselves. This is not surprising given the difficulty of \ncollecting such items. However, as we have argued in the previous section, applied \nethnography can elicit design episodes, that provide ecologically valid materials for a \nstudy employing the sort method to explore design expertise. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 21 \n \n4.2. Combining ethnography and experimentation: An example  \nWe have recently undertaken a study which combined applied ethnography with the \nuse of a sort method. The aim of the study was to investigate whether natural \ncategories that expert designers use to classify design information can be identified. \nThese categories could then form the basis for a notation for encoding design \ninformation within DESPERADO. Lack of space precludes a detailed description of \nthe study. However, a brief description of the study illustrates the combination of \napplied ethnography with controlled experimentation.  \n The study took place at a major manufacturer of personal computers (PCs), \nand involved two phases. In the first phase, our researcher spent two weeks \nconducting an applied ethnographic study of design practices within the company\u2019s \nsoftware development team, which had twelve full-time members. The researcher \nfollowed the same approach to that described in the previous section, collecting a \nmixture of field notes, taped interviews and meetings, texts and other company \ndocumentation, whilst noting personal observations and commentary. At the end of \nthis period, in addition to studying descriptions of design practices from the \nethnographic observations made by the researcher, we selected from the data a set of \nthirty design episodes to serve as the basis for the sort study. The episode set was \nchosen to reflect the different types of design information that were evident in the \nethnographic data (see Table 2 for examples). \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 about here \n----------------------------------------- \n Participants carried out the sorts individually, in their own office. Each \nparticipant reviewed a set of sort instructions that included an example sort. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 22 \nParticipants were then given a packet of 30 cards, each card displaying one design \nepisode. Participants were asked to sort the episodes into natural categories segregated \nby a dimension of their own choosing, and that captured a view of the episodes that \nwas deemed important or relevant to their own design activities. They were told to use \nas many or as few categories as they found necessary to represent each grouping. Each \nparticipant completed two sorts, and the dimensions used to differentiate categories \nand the cards assigned to each category were recorded. The resulting data were \nanalysed using cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling techniques (Ormerod, \nBall and Rummer\n36\n), but here we report only a sample of observations.  \n A number of interesting findings emerge from the analyses. To enable us to \ndetect common patterns in sorting behaviour, the dimensions were summarised and \ncompared for semantic similarity. Table 3 outlines the kinds of dimension produced \nby the designers. It is notable that, of the 17 sorts generated (one designer was only \nprepared to undertake a single sort), 15 are captured by just four dimensions. What is \ninteresting is how some of these dimensions, and more specifically the categories \ngenerated within them, corroborate the observations made by Bucciarelli\n17 \nin his \nethnographic analysis of design. Notably, the dimension \u2018relevant to specific \ngroup\/role\u2019 corresponds with his notion of object worlds, the dimension \u2018design \nprocess\/stage\u2019 corresponds with his notion of the importance of specification and \nconstraint, and the dimension \u2018episode content type\u2019 corresponds to his notion of the \nrole played by different types of negotiation. Thus, the sort study is able to verify the \nobservations that emerge from this ethnographic study. \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 about here \n----------------------------------------- \n The average number of categories produced in each sort was 5.8 (standard \ndeviation = 2.3). Much of the variability comes from a single designer, who produced \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 23 \n10 categories in his first sort, and 11 categories in his second sort. Examples of \ncategories produced are shown in Table 3. In the absence of presenting full statistical \nanalyses, it is inappropriate to comment upon the clustering of cards in each category \nacross designers and consistency of designer\u2019s sorts beyond a few broad observations. \nHowever, it is apparent that designers were highly consistent in their category \nassignments under the dimensions of  \u2018relevant to specific group\/role\u2019 and \u2018product\u2019, \nbut much less so under more evaluative dimensions such as \u2018episode content type\u2019 and \n\u2018design process\/stage\u2019. This is not surprising when one considers the nature of these \ndimensions, the former delineating category membership on the basis of recognisable \nfunction, component or product names, the latter influencing category membership by \nfactors such as the perceived usefulness, importance and priority of design \ninformation.  \n What is particularly clear is that the role played by each designer in the \nsoftware development team had a strong influence on their categorisation \nperformance. Three of the designers played a senior or managerial role in the team, \nand their sorts had rather different priorities than the programmers in the team. For \ninstance, the programmers tended to produce more marked or \u2018critical\u2019 evaluative \ncategories (e.g., \u201conly relevant to specific participants\u201d; \u201ctrivial information\u201d; \u201ctoo \ndetailed to be worth inspecting closely\u201d; \u201cexcellent program structure\u201d), the managers \ntended to produce more open evaluative categories (e.g., \u201cdetailed decision-making\u201d; \n\u201chigh-level discussion\u201d; \u201cexternal influences\u201d; \u201ccommon building blocks\u201d). \nDifferences in sort performance between the various specialist roles within the design \nteam, and the implication that the same design information is evaluated under \ndifferent metrics across roles, corroborate our observations from the ethnographic \nstudy that design re-use may differ in individual and team contexts. \n \n5. Conclusions \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 24 \nIn this paper we have discussed how the method of ethnography can, and perhaps \neven should, be adapted for the study of realistic design activities. Applied \nethnography differs from a prototypical case of pure ethnography in three principal \nways that are associated with its inherent purposiveness: through differences in \nintensity of observation, in being less independent of prior theory, and in requiring a \ndegree of verifiability or objectivity in interpretation. We have illustrated how using \nan applied ethnographic technique enabled us to gain important insights into the \nnature of team design practices that were not possible with more conventional \nprotocol analysis techniques. We were able to sample sufficient data over only a two-\nweek period to make a major contribution to revising the specification of a design re-\nuse support tool in some important ways. We have also shown how combining the \noutcomes of applied ethnography with a traditional cognitive method such as the card \nsort enabled us to verify in a more objective fashion the observations made in \nprevious ethnographic studies. \n We argue that it is imperative that the differences between applied \nethnography, as exemplified in the examples above and practised by other design \nresearchers, and a traditional form of pure ethnography, as espoused by researchers \nfrom an anthropological tradition, be clearly stated. Design research that adopts \naspects of ethnography without clarifying the exact nature of the adoption runs a \nnumber of risks. For example, researchers may find that ethnography falls down on \ngrounds of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Also, they may fail to recognise the \nimportance of achieving a high degree of verifiability and objectivity where \nethnography is conducted in pursuit of meeting design goals and objectives. \nFurthermore, a failure to clarify the precise nature of applied ethnography may mean \nthat design researchers are faced with what may turn out in the end to be unnecessary \nand uninformative critiques based upon the assumptions of pure ethnography.  \n \n \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 25 \n \n \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 26 \nReferences \n \n1 Anderson, R J \u2018Representations and requirements: The value of ethnography in \nsystem design\u2019 Human-Computer Interaction  Vol 9.

Situatedness Data are collected by a participant observer who is \nlocated within the everyday context of interest (e.g., a \ncommunity of practitioners). \n2. Richness The observer studies behaviour in all of its various \nmanifestations such that data are gathered from a wide \nrange of sources including interviews, team \ndiscussions, incidental conversations, documents, and \nnon-verbal interactions. \n3. Participant Autonomy The observees are not required to comply in any rigid, \npre-determined study arrangements.  \n4. Openness The observer remains open to the discovery of novel \nor unexpected issues that may come to light as a study \nprogresses. \n5. Personalisation The observer makes a note of their own feelings in \nrelation to situations encountered during data \ncollection and analysis. \n6. Reflexivity The observer adopts a reflective and empathetic stance \nin striving toward an understanding of the observee\u2019s \npoint of view; the observer taking account of, rather \nthan striving to eliminate, their own effects upon the \nbehaviour of the observees. \n7. Self-reflection The observer acknowledges that any interpretative act \nis influenced by the tradition to which they themselves \nbelong. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 31 \n8. Intensity Observations are intensive and long-term so as to \nenable the observer to become immersed in the \nongoing culture of the observee's environment.  \n9. Independence The observer aims not to be constrained by any pre-\ndetermined goal-set, mind-set or theory. \n10. Historicism The observer aims to connect observations to a \nbackdrop of historical and cultural contingencies. \nApplying ethnography in engineering design \n 32 \nTable 2.
