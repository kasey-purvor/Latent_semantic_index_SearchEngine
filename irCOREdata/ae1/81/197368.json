This study challenges some \npast speculations about online relationships, and argues that future research \nmust consider demographic details more when examining interactions on the \nInternet. \n \n \n 2 \n1. Introduction \nInterest in the development of online relationships is becoming increasingly \npopular. One of the ongoing debates is whether Internet relationships are impersonal \nand hostile, or whether in fact the Internet offers opportunities for the development of \nhighly intimate interactions. Given that some theorists have argued that physical and \nnonverbal cues are a necessary channel for communicating emotional intimacy (e.g., \nAltman & Taylor, 1973), researchers have questioned how intimacy can be achieved \nin online settings where these cues are absent. While some theorists have claimed that \nonline friendships and romances can be formed in online settings (e.g., Parks & \nFloyd, 1996; Parks & Roberts, 1998), others contend that Internet relationships are \nimpersonal and can lead to uninhibited behavior, such as flaming (Rice & Love, \n1987).  \nThis present study examines interpersonal interactions experienced in chat \nrooms. It seeks to gain further understanding of these interactions. In particular, this \ncurrent study is interested in two aspects of computer mediated communication. \nFirstly, whether emotional support is available in chat rooms. Secondly, how open \nand honest participants are in chat rooms. \n \n1.1 Emotional support or a cause of depression? \nTheorists are divided in opinion as to whether the Internet causes depression \nor is a source of emotional support. Kraut, Patterson, Lundmark, Kiesler, \nMukopadhyay and Scherlis (1998) conducted a longitudinal study, where 73 \nhouseholds (169 individuals) were given free equipment to access the Internet. \nAnalysis of pre and post measures revealed that greater Internet use was associated \nwith increases in depression scores and loneliness. Moreover, initial depression and \n 3 \nloneliness did not predict subsequent Internet use. Hence, these researchers concluded \nthat the Internet is a causal factor in depression. Contrary to these findings \nMcConatha, McConatha and Dermigny (1994) reported in their study of 14 nursing \nhome residents that after using the online services for six months, the participants \nwere less depressed. Bier, Sherblom, and Gollo (1996) revealed similar results in their \nstudy that examined the impact of the Internet on lower income families. Although a \nquantitative measure of depression was not employed, it was clear that the \nparticipants' sense of social and psychological well-being had increased during the \nexperiment. In fact so much so, that when it came time for the participants to return \nthe computer equipment many refused, stating that this would mean the loss of their \nnewly formed identities, friends and communities.  \nA limitation of all of the above studies is that they have not accounted for the \ndifferent modes of communication available on the Internet (e.g., synchronous \ncommunication such as chat rooms, and asynchronous such as emails and \nnewsgroups). In the absence of this recognition, we cannot confidently draw a \nconclusion from any of these studies. This present study attempts to redress this \nproblem. Although it does not attempt to investigate availability of emotional support \nin all forms of communication online, it does examine emotional support in chat \nrooms. \n \n1.2 Open and honest or deceptive liars? \nSome theories, such as 'the social presence theory' and\/or 'the social context \ncues theory', argue that as social presence declines, and with an absence of social \ncues, relationships become less personal and intimate. In contrast, it has been argued \n 4 \nthat this anonymity allows some people in chat rooms to disclose more than they \nwould in face to face relationships (e.g., Whitty & Gavin, 2000, in press).  \nThe Internet has been described as a playground where people like to try on \ndifferent personalities (Rheingold, 1993). Lea and Spears (1995) report that within \nMUDS (Multi User Dungeons) gender switching often occurs. These theorists argue \nthat women often disguise themselves as men to experiment with power associated \nwith neutral or male identities. Moreover, they swap genders to avert unwanted \nattention from men. In contrast, these theorists believe that men pretend to be women \nin order to experience the type of behaviors often shown to women. \nWhitty and Gavin (2001) found in their research that telling 'white lies' \nprovided men with a space to feel safe to be more open about themselves. In other \nwords, the 'white lies' ensured these respondents anonymity, which in turn allowed \nthem to be freer to express more intimate or 'secret' details about themselves. \nParadoxically, the women in this study were more likely to lie or withhold details \nabout themselves (such as where they lived), for safety reasons. These women were \nmore concerned about being harassed. \n This present study examines further whether people are open and honest about \nthemselves in chat rooms. Participants in this study were asked how open they are \nabout themselves, whether they lie about their age, gender, where they lived, \neducation, occupation and income, and moreover, if they did lie why were they \nmotivated to do so. \n \n1.3 Aims of the study \nAspects unique to chat rooms were accounted for when devising the survey for \nthis study. For instance, it is noteworthy that chat rooms participants can be \n 5 \ncompletely anonymous. They can select their own screen name that will not reveal \ntheir true identities or gender. Furthermore, they do not need to disclose their email \naddress. Communication occurs in real time where individuals are free to roam from \nroom to room and chat with whomever they please.  \nThe main aims of this research were twofold. Firstly, to investigate whether \nchat rooms provide a space where emotional support is available. The second aim was \nto examine openness and dishonesty in chat rooms.  \nRather than simply comparing online and offline experiences, other variables \nsuch as age, gender, hours spent per week in a chat room and experienced users were \nconsidered. While some researchers (e.g., Parks & Floyd, 1996; Parks & Roberts, \n1998) have considered demographics such as length of time using the Internet, age, \ngender and marital status, there is still a paucity of research available on the different \ngroups of people who access the Internet and their motivations for doing so. Gender \ndifferences were deemed important to consider given that past studies have already \nidentified gender differences in dishonesty in chat rooms (e.g, Whitty & Gavin, in \npress). Age differences were also taken into account, given that while past studies \nhave drawn conclusions about available emotional support on the Internet focusing on \ndiscrete age groups (e.g., McConatha et al\u2019s research on nursing home residents) few \nstudies have explicitly investigated age differences. The amount of time and \nexperience using chat rooms also should be considered, since it might be that regular \nusers are more likely to use the Internet for different purposes than irregular ones.  \n \n 6 \n2. Method \n \n2.1 Participants and procedure \nOne hundred and eighty first year social psychology students from the \nUniversity of Western Sydney were requested to distribute surveys devised by this \nresearcher to one male and one female (all of the surveys were administered face to \nface, rather than online). They were given two months to find two respondents. \nStudents were not penalized if they did not distribute the surveys, nor were they given \ncredit for the task. Furthermore, to ensure that students did not feel coerced into \nobtaining respondents, they handed in their surveys in a locked box located in one of \nthe buildings at the university. This procedure was implemented so that students \nwould not feel uncomfortable if they did not hand in a survey in class. Moreover, \nthere would be little motivation to fudge the survey by filling the survey in \nthemselves. \nOnly respondents who use chat rooms were invited to complete the survey. In \ntotal, 320 surveys were returned, with 160 women and 160 men completing the \nsurvey. The sample ranged from 17-55 years with a mean age of 21.3 years (SD = \n6.13). They were all Australian residents. \nIn considering the highest level of education achieved by this sample, 0.6% \nhad achieved primary school level, 8.1% high school level, 13.8% school certificate \nlevel, 51.2% had completed the higher school certificate (year 12), 8.8% had obtained \na certificate, 8.4% a diploma, 7.5% a degree, and 1.6% postgraduate qualifications. \nAccording to educational statistics put together by the Australian Bureau of Statistics \n(1998) this sample can be considered a reasonably good representation of the \neducational levels achieved by the Australian population. \n 7 \n Participants' relationship status was also obtained. It was found that 87.4% of \nthe respondents were single, 6.6% were married, 3.4% were de-facto, 1.3% were \nseparated, and 1.3% were divorced. \n The numbers of hours per week and the length of time respondents have used \nchat rooms was acquired. It was found that 52.2% of the respondents spend on \naverage at least 2 hours per week in a chat room, 22.5% spend 3-5 hours, 13.8% \nspend 6-10 hours, 5.6% spend 11-15 hours, 2.5% spend 16-20 hours and 3.4% spend \n21+ hours. Moreover, it was found that 9.7% had been using chat rooms for less than \na month, 9.4% had been using them for 1-2 months, 17.5% had been using them for 2-\n6 months, and 63.4% had been using them for over 6 months. \n \n2.2 Instrument \nThe 'Chat Room Survey' was constructed, which asked respondents about how \nopen, supportive and honest they are in chat rooms.1 The first section of the survey \nasked for demographic details. Following this, respondents were asked to rate their \nanswers on a likert scale: 1 = never, 2 = a little, 3 = sometimes, 4 = most of the time, \nand 5 = always. More specifically, they were asked whether they received or gave \nemotional support in chat rooms; how open they were in chat rooms compared to \noffline conversations; whether they lied in chat rooms, and what they lied about; and \nfinally they were asked questions concerning what their reasons were for lying. \n \n3. Results \n \nSeveral analyses were conducted examining the predictor variables: age, \ngender, 'hours per week' (the amount of hours per week respondents typically spend in \n                                                \n1 see author for copy of survey \n 8 \nchat rooms) and 'experience' (the length of time respondents have used chat rooms). \nBecause age was slightly skewed toward the younger individuals it was divided into \ntwo categories: 17-20 years (65% of participants) and 21-55 years (35% participants). \nIn addition, the predictor variables hours per week and experience were slightly \nskewed. Therefore the categories for hours per week included: 0-2 hours (52% of \nparticipants), 3-10 hours (36% of participants), and 11-21+ hours (12% of \nparticipants). The categories for experience included: 0-2 months (19% of \nparticipants), 2-6 months (18% of participants), and over 6 months (63% of \nparticipants). \n \n3.1 Emotional support \n \n Interestingly, 63% of the participants reported that they received at least some \nemotional support in chat rooms. An analysis of variance was conducted to \ninvestigate gender, age, hours per week, and experience differences in receiving \nemotional support. There was a statistically significant main effect for age [F(1,313) = \n7.68, p = 0.01], and hours per week [F(2, 313) = 17.60, p = 0.00]. The 21-55 year olds \nscored higher on receiving emotional support (M = 2.36, SD = 1.20) than the 17-20 \nyear olds (M = 2.07, SD = 1.12). Those who spend 11-21+ hours in chat rooms scored \nhigher on receiving emotionally support (M = 2.86, SD = 1.29) than those who spend \n0-2 hours (M = 1.82, SD = 0.98). \n An analysis of variance was conducted to investigate gender, age, hours per \nweek, and experience differences in giving emotional support. There was a \nstatistically significant main effect for gender [F(1,313) = 10.48, p = 0.001], hours per \nweek [F(2,313) = 15.22, p = 0.000], and experience [F(2,313) = 4.61, p = 0.011]. \nWomen scored higher on giving emotional support (M = 2.79, SD = 1.12) than men \n(M = 2.4, SD = 1.23). Those who spend 11-21+ hours in chat rooms scored higher on \n 9 \ngiving emotional support (M = 3.35, SD = 1.09) than those who spend 0-2 hours (M = \n2.27, SD = 1.09). Moreover, the more experienced users of 6 months or more scored \nhigher on giving emotional support (M = 2.77, SD = 1.18) than those who had been \nusing chat rooms for a relatively short amount of time (M = 2.36, SD = 1.19). \n \n3.2 Openness \nAn analysis of variance was conducted to investigate gender, age, hours per \nweek, and experience differences in how open people are about themselves in chat \nrooms. There was a statistically significant main effect for hours per week [F(2, 313) \n= 12.37, p = 0.00]. Those who spend 11-21+ hours in chat rooms scored higher on \nopenness (M = 3.11, SD = 1.26) than those who spend 0-2 hours (M = 2.37, SD = \n1.26). \n \n \n3.3 Dishonesty \n \n An analysis of variance was conducted to investigate gender, age, hours per \nweek, and experienced differences in whether people lie in chat rooms. There was a \nstatistically significant main effect for gender [F(1,313) = 5.40, p = 0.021], and hours \nper week [F(2,313) = 3.14, p = 0.045]. It was found that men (M = 3.09, SD = 1.16) \nlie more than women (M = 2.81, SD = 1.11), and that people who use chat rooms for \n0-2 hours per week (M = 3.06, SD = 1.23), were more likely to lie than those who use \nchat rooms for 11-21 hours per week (M = 2.49, SD = 1.17). \n An analysis of variance was conducted to investigate gender, age, hours per \nweek, and experience differences in whether people lie for safety reasons. There was \na statistically significant main effect for gender [F(1,313) = 4.94, p = 0.027], and age \n[F(1,313) = 7.26, p = 0.007]. It was found that women (M = 2.79, SD = 1.35) scored \n 10 \nhigher than men (M = 2.38, SD = 1.30), and that the 17-20 year olds (M = 2.76, SD = \n1.35) scored higher than the 21-55 year olds (M = 2.27, SD = 1.26). \n An analysis of variance was conducted to investigate gender, age, hours per \nweek, and experience differences in whether people withheld information so that \nothers would not discover their identity. There was a statistically significant age by \ngender effect [F(1,313) = 6.03, p = 0.015). Younger women (M = 3.00, SD = 1.33), \nscored higher than the older women (M = 2.25, SD = 1.26). \n Given that the distributions for the dependent variables lying about age, \ngender, where one lives, occupation, education and income were heavily skewed, it \nwas decided to re-code these dependent variables into two categories: 1 = did not lied; \n2 = lied. Logistic regressions were performed (using backward Wald), to investigate \ngender, age, hours per week, and experience differences in what people lied about in \nchat rooms. The significant differences are shown in Table 1. \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \n  Given that the distributions for lying to make occupation, education and \nincome sound better were heavily skewed, it was decided to re-code these dependent \nvariables into two categories: 1 = did not lied; 2 = lied. Logistic regressions were \nperformed (using backward Wald), to investigate gender, age, hours per week, and \nexperience differences. The significant differences are shown in Table 2. \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \n \nOverall, a number of significant differences were revealed. Table 3 below \npresents a summary of all the results. \nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE \n   \n 11 \n4. Discussion \n \n This current research highlights some important differences in interpersonal \ninteractions in chat rooms. It demonstrates that we do need to consider age, gender, \ntime spent in chat rooms and experience differences when investigating the formation \nof online relationships. \nSixty-three percent of respondents received some emotional support from chat \nrooms. Although this still does not adequately cast light on whether the Internet can \ncause depression, it does impart that people believe they receive some type of support \nin chat rooms. This supports the notion that the Internet does offer opportunities for \nthe development of intimate relationships. More importantly, this study found that it is \nunlikely that intimate relationships are formed instantly, but that rather, with time, \nemotional support is given and received in chat rooms. This study also found that the \nmore time people spend in chat rooms the more open they are about themselves. \nOverall, these results suggest that the development of trust, as in offline relationships, \nis gradual in chat rooms. As in traditional face-to-face relationships, in chat rooms, \none needs to spend time becoming familiar with another before they start to disclose \npersonal information about themselves.  \nAnother interesting result was that individuals aged 21-55 years are more \nlikely to receive emotional support than younger people aged 17-20 years. Although \nfuture research needs to consider more discrete age categories, these results suggest \nthat we need to consider age differences when investigating the types and quality of \ninteractions developed in chat rooms.  \nTheorists, such as Stone (1995), have proposed that the Internet offers \nopportunities for people to break away from traditional stereotypical roles. This study \nfound little support for this notion. For example, the women in this study took up the \n 12 \ntraditional role of provider of emotional social support. Research on traditional \nrelationships has found that women tend to be more nurturing and emotionally sharing \nin relationships than men are in relationships (Wright, 1989). It appears that it is not \nso easy to escape traditional gender roles. \n Noticeably, this study revealed that people who spend the least amount of time \nin chat rooms per week are more likely to tell lies. This could be for two reasons. \nFirstly, it may be that these participants do not intend to use chat rooms as a regular \nform of communication, and instead use them for light entertainment where they can \nexperiment with different roles and schemas. Alternatively, due to lack of familiarity \nwith this mode of communication, these people may not feel comfortable to disclose; \nhowever, with more exposure to chat rooms these individuals might begin to be more \nhonest and open about themselves. \nIn line with Whitty and Gavin's (2001) research, this study found that men lie \nin public chat rooms more than women do. The men in this current study lied more \nthan women about their gender, occupation, education and income. It was also found \nthat men more than women try to make their occupation, education, and income \nsound better than it actually is.  \nLea and Spears (1995) found that gender switching often occurs with MUDS; \nhence, it is not remarkable to find that this also occurs in chat rooms. It is however, \nnoteworthy that men swap gender more than women do. It may be that case that \npretending to be a woman has its benefits, such as being more accepted to discuss \nemotional matters, which is usually a topic of conversation for women. Masquerading \nas a woman might also create more opportunities for a man in a chat room to have \nother women chat with him (ironically, however, these apparent women might also be \nmen).  \n 13 \nThe reason why men lie more about their occupation, education and income, \ncan be explained by traditional theories of romantic relationships. Psychologists have \nargued that women have a sexual preference for men who are more intelligent, \nambitious and have higher socio-economic status (Wright, 1999). Research carried \nout on ads placed in lonely hearts columns show that men are more likely than women \nto emphasize their own educational and occupational status (e.g., Koestner & \nWheeler, 1988). Thus, it may be that men lie in chat rooms about these aspects to \nappear more sexually attractive to women. Future research might also consider if \nwomen lie more than men about their physical appearance, since past research has \nalso found that men traditionally prefer women who are physically attractive.  \n Congruous with past research (e.g., Whitty & Gavin, 2001), this current study \nfound that women lied more than men for safety reasons. Younger people also lied \nmore than older people for safety reasons. In addition, younger women withheld \ninformation so that other will not discover their identity more than the older women \ndid. Although chat room relationships can be completely anonymous, where one \ncould argue is a safe place, it seems that some women and younger people do not \nperceive it to be safe. This is probably because they bring their understandings of face \nto face relationships to their interactions in chat rooms, and for this reason are more \ntimid and fearful of chat room interactions. Another explanation might be that these \nwomen and younger participants are frequently asked personal details, and that if \nanswered truthfully might divulge enough information to be tracked down. Rather \nthan terminate a potentially good relationship, these respondents might opt to lie \nabout such details. As Brail (1996) has commented \u201cOnline harassment is a tough \nissue. Finding the fine line between censorship and safety and creating a better \nenvironment for women in cyberspace, are complex tasks\u201d (p.141). \n 14 \nTo conclude, this current research challenges the argument that only shallow \nand meaningless relationships are developed online. Rather, it is argued here that \nemotional support is available in chat rooms. This current study also stresses the \nimportance of examining variables such as age, gender, time spent in chat rooms, and \nexperience, rather than simply comparing online and offline interactions. Moreover, \nwhile some argue that the Internet provides an opportunity for participants to escape \ntraditional gender roles, this study found, on the contrary, that traditional gender roles \nare often replicated online. \n \n 15 \n References \n \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics.
