It is our great hidden problem - little discussed because of the shame which surrounds \nit.  Some 16% of all adults have a diagnosable condition of clinical depression or anxiety \ndisorder.1  Yet only a quarter of these are in treatment. \nThis is a huge problem involving massive suffering and major economic cost.  So \nwhy is there so much untreated illness?  The main reason is simple.  The majority of \npatients with these problems who present in GP surgeries are only offered medication and \nit is what the majority of patients in treatment are receiving.2  But the majority of those \nwho go to the doctor with these problems would prefer psychological therapy.  This \nemerges clearly from every survey of patient preferences.3  The evidence also shows that \nthe majority of those who prefer psychological therapy choose not to get treated at all \nrather than go on medication.  So we have massive under-treatment due to the poor \navailability of psychological therapy.  \nThis would not matter much if psychological treatment was an inferior treatment.  \nBut hundreds of clinical trials for depression and anxiety disorders show that modern \nevidence-based treatments, especially cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are as \neffective as drugs in the short run, and more effective at preventing relapse (unless drugs \ncontinue to be taken indefinitely).  For these reasons NICE Guidelines say that, unless \ntheir condition is very recent, all these patients should be offered the choice of CBT.4  \nCBT is a talking therapy in which patients are given tools to control their feelings \nincluding the ability to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, and to cultivate positive \nthinking and action.  Normally treatment does not involve more than 16 sessions.  In \nsome cases NICE also recommend other therapies. \nBut unfortunately the Guidelines are simply not implemented, due to lack of \ntherapists within the NHS.  This is the clearest breach of any of the NICE Guidelines for \nany illness affecting large numbers of people.  It also represents the greatest gap between \nbest practice and actual practice anywhere in the NHS and it affects millions. \nThat it continues is wrong in medical terms.  But it is also a major economic issue \n\u2013 which is what this article is about.  Depression and anxiety make it much more difficult \nfor a person to work.  There is thus a substantial loss of output.  There is also a major cost \nto the Exchequer since about one million people are on incapacity benefits due to \ndepression or anxiety disorders and it costs the Exchequer \u00a3750 for each month that \nsomeone is on these benefits rather than working. \n These economic costs add weight to the humanitarian argument for implementing \nthe NICE Guidelines.  Because of them, there is now major government interest in \nproposals to implement the Guidelines by a major expansion of psychological therapy \nwithin the NHS.  In its 2005 Election Manifesto the Labour Party committed itself to \nsuch a major expansion.  But the scale and speed with which it happens depends in part \non the strength of the economic case for doing it. \n                                                 \n1 ONS Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Under 1% have psychotic disorders, which are not covered by this \npaper. \n2 See ONS Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. \n3 For a survey of the studies see van Schaik et al. (2004). See also Chilvers et al (2001). \n4 The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have produced separate guidelines for \neach of the main conditions, see their website. \n  2 \n This case rests on the standard comparison of costs and benefits.  The cost of \nproviding a standard course of CBT is \u00a3750, which provides for roughly 10 meetings \u2013 a \nreasonable average which allows for the usual drop-outs and a range of durations of \ntreatment.5  To estimate the benefits, we draw not on one particular experiment but on a \nwide range of evidence from Britain and elsewhere (and not on one particular \nexperiment). \n The question is: What would be the impact of implementing the NICE Guidelines \nfor a representative sample of people who have depression and\/or anxiety disorders?  To \nanswer it, we address in sequence the following questions: \n \n1.      If people are treated for a disorder, what percentage are cured (above natural \nrecovery)? \n 2.      If people are cured, how much more work do they do? \n3.      As a result, how much benefit accrues to society as a whole (including the \npatient) and to the Exchequer? \n \nWe then compare these benefits with the cost.  Our conclusions are that the benefits to \nthe economy will exceed the costs, and that the savings to the Exchequer will exceed the \nExchequer costs, possibly within two years of the treatment and certainly within five. \n \n \n1.  The Effects of Treatment on Health \n \nFor purposes of the analysis, we focus on the effect of taking into treatment a \nrepresentative sample of patients who would otherwise have no treatment.6  We begin \nwith the impact on their health. \nAs Table 1 shows, some 82% of those who begin treatment will persevere with it \nand of these 61% will recover within 4 months (ie they will cease to be diagnosed as a \n\u2018case\u2019 of the disorder).  But some sufferers would recover in any event, so that the net \neffect of treatment on recovery is that shown in column (4) of the table. \nThis table is based on judgment and reflects hundreds of clinical trials.  It is \nsometimes alleged that, when therapies are used in the \u2018field\u2019, the success rates are lower \nthan in the clinical trials.  This is not necessarily the case.7  But, to be on the safe side, we \nuse success rates in Table 1 that are well below those obtained in the most successful \n                                                 \n5 Curtis and Netten (2006) give a \u00a366 cost per session, but the NICE Guidelines for PTSD gives an \u00a382 cost \nper session.  We envisage that some sessions would use computerised CBT or less intensive methods than \none-to-one face-to-face one-hour sessions, thus reducing the cost.  Our estimate also allows for the \namortised cost of CBT training. \n6 The weights given to the different conditions are shown in Annex 2. \n7 The following five articles report field results of CBT where success rates were comparable with standard \nclinical trials.  (Clinical trals are generally confined to patients with only one condition which in the field \nmany patients have multiple conditions.) The results cover social phobia, anxiety and depression, \nagoraphobia, panic disorder and PTSD.  See Lincoln et al (2003), Persons et al (2005), Hahlweg  et al \n(2001), Wade et al (1998) and Gillespie et al (2002). \n  3 \nclinical trials.8  The assumptions made were endorsed at a one-day conference of leading \nexperts held at the Department of Health in May 2006. \nThe table highlights the power of CBT, compared with no treatment.  For both \ndepression and anxiety disorders it is at least as effective as drugs during the treatment \nphase, but it is more effective than drugs in preventing relapse unless drugs are taken \ncontinuously9.  Figure 1 illustrates this point.10 \nThus the effect of treatment involves not simply whether the person recovers but \nhow long he is well rather than ill, as a result of the treatment.  This is examined in the \nfirst two columns of Table 2.  Here we allow for two important points: that natural \nrecovery goes on beyond 4 months, while at the same time some cured patients relapse \ninto illness.  The conclusion is that, in the 2 years after treatment ends, a treated patient \nwill spend 6.5 months extra being well. In the longer period of 5 years, he will spend 13.1 \nmonths extra being well. \nThus there are substantial gains in healthy life, which relieves suffering.  But what \nis the effect of this extra health upon employment? \n \n \n2.  Effect of Health upon Employment  \n \nTo find the effect of health on employment, there are two possible sources of evidence:  \ncross-sectional and longitudinal.  We use both kinds, beginning with cross-sectional.   \nTable 3 is from the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey.  As it shows, 51% of the \nmentally ill group are in employment, compared with 74% of those who are well \u2013 a \ndifference of 23 percentage points.  It would be unreasonable to assume that, if the same \nindividual moves from mental illness to health, his probability of employment changes by \nthe full difference of 23 percentage points; for there may be other reasons for his non-\nemployment which continue to operate when his mental illness is cured.  We therefore \nassume that the actual change will be 60% of the simple difference \u2013 that is 14 percentage \npoints.11  \n We can now revert to Table 2 to find the overall effect of treatment on \nemployment.  This is shown in Columns (4) and (5).  The implication is that, following \ntreatment, a person can expect on average to work 0.99 extra months in the following two \nyears.  If we consider the whole period of five years, the expected effect is roughly twice \nas large. \n These effects come about in two ways:  A mentally ill person with a job may risk \nlosing it; timely treatment can prevent this; equally, those who are out of work due to \nmental illness become more likely to work if they recover from their illness. \n                                                 \n8 These are summarised by Pilling and Clark in Annexes A1 and A2 of Department of Health, An Outline \nBusiness Case for the National Roll-Out of Local Psychological Therapy Services. \n9 This means that if we simply replaced ongoing drug treatment by one-off CBT there would be little \npredictable change in health outcomes, nor in cost.  That is one reason why our analysis focuses on getting \nmore people treated. But the main reason for this is that we want more people to be treated. \n10 This figure is based on quite small sample numbers.  For the first 16 months the profiles are very similar \nto those in the larger samples studied by Paykel et al. (1999). \n11 This is a conservative assumption, for it does not allow for employment support of the kind envisaged in \ngovernment proposals. This support would of course also add to the cost. \n  4 \nIn addition, even if they do not lose their job, mentally ill workers are more likely \nto take time off sick, which imposes a significant economic cost.  As Table 4 shows, \nworkers who are mentally ill take more days off sick than workers who are well.  The \ndifference is 20 days per year.  We can again assume that, if a once-sick person is well, \nhis absence is reduced by 60% of this figure, that is 12 days a year. \nSo what is the overall effect of treatment on work, via its effect on absenteeism?  \nTreatment raises healthy months by 27% (= 6.5\/24).  Half the treated population is \nemployed.  And over a two year period they work an extra 24 days, equivalent to 1.2 \nmonths of work.  So the total increase in work per person treated is 0.15 months (= 1.2 x \n.27 x .5).  This represents a significant addition to the extra 0.99 months of employment \nrecorded earlier. \n \n \n3.  Longitudinal Evidence \n \nAll of these estimates are based on cross-sectional evidence.  What confidence can we \nhave that we would get the same effects if we treated someone and followed his progress \nlongitudinally?  There are a number of longitudinal studies which we can compare with \nour own assumptions.12   \nFor these purposes it is convenient to first summarise our assumptions, as follows.  \nFor people who are previously ill and receive treatment, we assume the following \nchanges (for the two-year period after treatment): \n \n Employment rate increased by 4 percentage points (= 0.99\/24)  \n Absenteeism reduced by 3 days per year per worker (= 12 x 6.5\/24). \n \nHow do these estimates compare with the longitudinal evidence, most of which \ncomes from the US.13  Two random assignment trials have traced the impact of treatment \non employment.  In one trial depressed patients were given enhanced mental health \ntreatment,14 and compared with controls who received treatment as usual (Wells et al, \n2000).  The effect of enhanced treatment was to raise the employment rates 12 months \nlater by 5 percentage points \u2013 similar to our own estimates. \nIn another random control trial patients with general anxiety disorder and\/or panic \ndisorder were given \u201ccollaborative mental health care\u201d and compared with treatment as \nusual (Rollman et al, 2005).15  The effect of the special treatment was to raise the \n                                                 \n12 None of the enhanced interventions studied is more substantial than the intervention we are proposing. \n13 This is a conservative assumption for it does not allow for employment support of the kind envisaged in \ngovernment proposals. This support would of course also add to the cost. \n14 \u201cMatched clinics were randomized to usual care (mailing of practice guidelines) or to 1 of 2 Quality \nImprovement programs that involved institutional commitment to Quality Improvement, training local \nexperts and nurse specialists to provide clinician and patient education, identification of a pool of \npotentially depressed patients, and either nurses for medication follow-up or access to trained \npsychotherapists.\u201d \n15 \u201cPatients were randomly assigned to a telephone-based care management intervention or to notification \nalone of the anxiety disorder to patients and their physicians. The intervention involved non-mental health \nprofessionals who provided patients with psychoeducation, assessed preferences for guideline-based care, \n  5 \nemployment rate 12 months later by 15 percentage points, and to reduce the absenteeism \nrate 12 months later by the equivalent of 31 days a year \u2013 both much bigger impacts than \nwe have allowed for. \nA small British study by David Clark also found absenteeism effects greater than \nwe have allowed for.  At the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma in Camberwell, \npatients were asked to fill in an employment questionnaire before and after CBT \ntreatment.  122 patients completed the questionnaire.  One question was \u201cHow many days \nhave you had off sick in the last month?\u201d  Among those employed the average days per \nmonth off sick after treatment were 1.6 less than before treatment \u2013 an annual rate of 19 \ndays. \nThe treatment effects discussed above combine the effect of treatment on health \nand the effect of health on employment.  One further US study enables us to study the \nsecond of these links in the chain: from health to employment.  This study covered people \ntreated for depression with anti-depressants, and compared for the next two years the \nemployment rate of those cured with those not cured (Simon et al, 2000).  The difference \nwas 15 percentage points - close to our assumption of 14 points.  (That causality runs \nmainly from health to employment, and not vice versa, is shown by timing effects (Mintz \net al, 1992)).16  The study also found that becoming healthy reduces a worker\u2019s \nabsenteeism by 12 days a year \u2013 exactly the same as the figure we assume. \nSo our assumptions about the employment effects of treatment appear quite \nreasonable in the light of the longitudinal evidence.  Note that we are not claiming huge \neffects.  We are saying that people who are treated are in consequence 4 percentage \npoints more likely to be in work over the next two years.  Clearly, if a person is cured of a \nchronic illness the effects last longer than this, and are thus greater.  But we want to be \nconservative and ignore these longer term effects. (For one thing we are interested in the \nimmediate savings to the Treasury.)  We thus focus on employment effects which are \nquite small but, as we shall see, remarkably valuable relative to the cost. \n \n \n4.  Valuing the Benefits \n \nOutput effects \n \nSo what is the value of these benefits in employment?  We assume (in line with DWP \npractice) that a previously disabled person who works earns on average an annual wage \nof \u00a312,000 \u2013 or \u00a31,000 a month.  (This is a conservative assumption since the Labour \nForce Survey shows that employees who report \u2018depression, bad nerves or anxiety\u2019 earn \non average \u00a318,200 a year.)  Thus the extra GDP produced by treating one person is \n\u00a31,100, the extra earnings from 1.1 extra months of work.  This compares with the \ntreatment cost of \u00a3750 (see Table 5). \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \nmonitored treatment responses, and informed physicians of their patients\u2019 care preferences and progress via \nan electronic medical record system under the direction of study investigators.\u201d \n16  This meta-study looked at 8 studies (using different treatments) which gave data on the timing of \nchanges in health and in employment. \n  6 \nSavings to the NHS \n \nThere are also economic savings through reduced uses of resources within the NHS \u2013 \nboth on the physical health side and the mental health side.  On the physical side there are \nat present many unnecessary referrals to the acute sector for conditions that are not \n\u201cmedically explicable\u201d \u2013 sometimes estimated as half of all referrals to the acute sector \n(Nimnuan et al, 2001).  In the USA it has been found that people suffering from anxiety \ncost roughly $350 a year more than other people in terms of non-psychiatric medical \ncosts (Greenberg et al, 1993, 2000).  If the position was similar in Britain for all \nconditions, the savings per person treated would be roughly \u00a3100 (within the first two \nyears). \nThere would also be important NHS savings on the mental health side \u2013 reduced \nreferrals to the secondary sector and inpatient admissions, fewer visits to GPs and \ncounselling sessions, and less medication.  In one study, referrals to secondary mental \nhealth services fell by almost 80% when GPs could refer patients to a CCBT clinic \nnearby, and they returned to their original level when the facility was withdrawn.17   \nOur knowledge in this whole area is weak.  But we include in Table 5 the guess \nthat the overall savings to the NHS per person treated is \u00a3300 over a two year period \u2013 \nincluding both physical and mental health services. \n \nReduced suffering \n \nFinally, we must of course value the reduction in suffering, which we can measure by the \nchange in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).  We assume that the change in QALYs \nfor each additional year of mental health is 0.2 QALYs.18  The expected gain in healthy \nlife per person treated is 0.55 years in the subsequent two years \u2013 a gain of 0.11 QALYs.  \nIf we value a QALY at \u00a330,000, as implied in much NICE discourse, this implies gains in \nQALYs worth \u00a33,300 per person treated.  On this basis the total gains to society per \nperson treated are \u00a34,700 \u2013 far exceeding the cost (see Table 5). \n \nSavings to the Exchequer \n \nA quite different issue is the gains to the Exchequer.  These include: \n \n(a) the fiscal impact of increased employment, through reduced \nbenefit  payments and increased tax receipts, and \n(b) the savings in NHS costs. \n \n                                                 \n17 Information from Isaac Marks \u2013 see Marks et al (2003). \n18 According to the standard method of calculating QALYs, a person who is otherwise healthy but on the \ndimension of anxiety\/depression reports \u2018some problems, moderately anxious or depressed\u2019 is given a \nQALY of 0.794 compared with 1.000 for someone who is completely healthy.  This yields a QALY deficit \nof roughly 0.2.  However, many people who suffer from anxiety\/depression also suffer on one of the 2 \nother Euroqual dimensions of illness (mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain\/discomfort) \u2013 in which \ncase the marginal impact of moderately anxious or depressed is roughly 0.1.  However we know that many \nof those other symptoms are due to mental illness, so we use the figure of 0.2.  The figure is also consistent \nwith the findings of Revicki et al (1998). \n  7 \nAs we have noted, there are two main ways in which therapy can affect the numbers in \nemployment and on IB.  It can affect the flow of people out of employment and onto IB, \nand the flow of people out of IB and into employment.  The net effect of these two effects \ncan be seen in the total stocks of people in employment and on IB. \nIn Table 3 we can see how profound the impact is.  It shows what proportion of \nthe mentally ill are on Incapacity Benefits or Income Support, as compared with those not \nmentally ill.  The difference is 30 percentage points.  As before, we assume that if a \nperson ceases to be ill the effect on his propensity to be on IB\/IS is 60 per cent of that \u2013 \nthat is 18 percentage points.  So if a person is treated and spends 6.5 fewer months being \nill, he will on average spend 1.17 fewer months on IB. \nIn line with DWP figures, we assume that the benefits paid per disabled person \nare \u00a36,000 per year (including incapacity benefit, income support, housing benefit and \ncouncil tax benefit), and that a person earning \u00a312,000 a year generates \u00a33,000 a year \nextra in NI, Income Tax and consumption taxes.  This makes a cost per person on benefit \nof \u00a39,000 a year \u2013 or \u00a3750 a month. \nThus the gains to the Exchequer when an extra person is treated are \u00a3900 in \nfinancial savings, plus NHS savings on top of that.  This is well above the cost of \u00a3750. \nAnd it only covers the first two years. \n \nLonger-term effects on IB \n \nHowever, when a person is cured of a chronic illness, the effects last longer than two \nyears.  These longer-term gains are more speculative but highly relevant.  The figures in \nTable 2 imply that the savings on IB over 5 years will be at least double what they are \nover 2 years.  Thus even if our estimates of the employment effects of better health \nwere reduced by a half, the programme would still pay for itself over 5 years. \nThe government is of course interested in aggregate effects as well as effects per \nperson treated.  How far will the programme contribute to the objective of reducing the \nnumbers on incapacity benefits by 1 million by 2016?  It appears that the Pathways to \nWork interviews and return to work bonuses have made little difference to the number of \nmentally ill people leaving IB.19  This shows the enormous importance of providing \npsychological therapies which can produce lasting changes in people and can also help to \nprevent them coming on to IB.   \nThe programme proposed in the LSE Depression Report envisaged a build up \nover a 6-year period, beginning in 2008\/9 and reaching full-scale operation in 2013\/4.20  \nBy that year 800,000 people would be receiving therapy each year.  This corresponds to \nabout one quarter of those who present at GP surgeries each year with mental health \nproblems.  It is also consistent with more detailed estimates based on the Psychiatric \nMorbidity Survey (Boardman and Parsonage, 2007).  Current Department of Health \nproposals for the Comprehensive Spending Review also reflect similar thinking.  They \nenvisage a local psychological therapy service in every Primary Care Trust area, to which \nGPs could refer their patients or patients could refer themselves.  The service would \ninclude some 30-60 therapists, the majority of whom would have had at least one year\u2019s \n                                                 \n19 DWP Research Report No 354, p53.

The team would have a physical centre but most of \nthe care would be done on an outreach basis, for example in GP surgeries.  \nIn Table 6 we estimate how such a programme would impact on the number on \nIB.  The calculations are done on the assumption that all those treated receive standard \ntreatment (costing around \u00a3750), leading to employment effects of the kind experienced \nin the past.  This is not quite right.  First, some will receive less intensive treatment (for \nless severe conditions).  But, second, the new service will be much more employment-\noriented than in the past.  \nAssuming these two differences cancel out the proposed programme will reduce \nthe numbers of mentally ill people on incapacity benefits by 160,000 by 2016.  This is \nless than proportional to the share of mentally ill people in the IB total.  But, even so, it \nwill in that year save the Exchequer \u00a31.4 billion a year \u2013 not bad for a programme costing \n\u00a30.4 billion a year.  \n \n \n5.  Conclusion \n \nOur analysis relates to the expected benefits from a standard treatment costing \u00a3750 per \npatient treated.  We mainly look at benefits per patient over the first two years after \ntreatment ends. \n \n1. The extra GDP produced over those two years is likely to be around \u00a31,200, and \nsociety will also gain from NHS savings of perhaps \u00a3300 and reduced suffering \nvalued (on NICE criteria) at around \u00a33,300.  These gains far exceed the cost of \u00a3750. \n \n2. The gain to the Exchequer is likely to be around \u00a3900 plus the NHS savings of \nperhaps \u00a3300.  Thus the cost is fully repaid. \n \nIf, instead, we look at longer-term gains we find the following. \n \n3. Even if we halve our assumptions about the effect of improved mental health on \nemployment, the treatment will pay for itself. \n \n4. By 2016 the new service would have reduced numbers on IB by 160,000, thus \nsaving \u00a31.4 billion a year to the Exchequer.  The cost of the service will by then \nbe \u00a30.4 billion a year. \n \nThe fundamental reason for the excess of benefit over cost is the high cost of a person on \nIB (\u00a3750 a month) and the low cost of treatment per person (a one-off \u00a3750).  \n  9 \nTable 1 \nEffectiveness of CBT in first 4 months (%) \n \n Retention rate Recovery rate \nNatural \nrecovery rate \nChange in per cent \nwho recover \n  (1) (2) (3) (4) \nDepression 80 60 30 24 \nPhobia 85 70 5 55 \nObsessive-compulsive disorder 80 55 5 40 \nPanic disorder 90 75 5 63 \nGeneral anxiety disorder 80 50 20 24 \nPost-traumatic stress 85 75 20 47 \nWeighted average 82 61 22 32 \nSource: See Annex 2 \n \nTable 2 \nImpact on health and employment per person treated  \n \n \n \nExtra months healthy Extra months of \nemployment per extra \nmonth of health \nExtra months of \nemployment \n In first \n2 years \n(1) \nIn first  \n5 years \n(2) \n \n \n(3) \nIn first \n2 years \n(4) \nIn first  \n5 years \n(5) \nDepression \nPhobia \nObsessive-compulsive disorder \nPanic disorder \nGeneral anxiety disorder \nPost-traumatic stress \n4.63 \n12.46 \n9.02 \n14.21 \n4.50 \n8.76 \n9.55 \n27.93 \n20.22 \n31.85 \n7.62 \n14.85 \n0.14 \n0.24 \n0.17 \n0.14 \n0.08 \n0.14 \n0.65 \n3.03 \n1.55 \n2.04 \n0.38 \n1.22 \n1.33 \n6.80 \n3.47 \n4.57 \n0.67 \n2.08 \nWeighted average 6.49 13.08 0.14 0.99 2.05 \nSource:  See Annex 2 \n  10 \nTable 3 \nEmployment and IB rates for people aged 16-64 (%) \n \n \nFull-time \nwork \nPart-time \nwork \n \nUnemployed \n \nInactive \n \n \nTotal \n% who are \non IB and \n\/ or IS \nNo mental disorder 55 19 3 23 100   8 \nDepression 36 14 4 45 100  42 \nPhobia 22 11 6 61 100  54 \nObsessive-compulsive 22 23 3 52 100  42 \nPanic disorder 30 20 5 45 100  35 \nGeneral anxiety 42 18 4 36 100  24 \nPost-traumatic stress 36 14 4 45 100  42 \nWeighted average 35 16 4 45 100      38 \nSource :  See Annex 2 \n \n \nTable 4 \nWorking days lost due to sickness absence \u2013 average per year per worker \n \nNo mental disorder 5 \nDepression 24 \nPhobia 52 \nObsessive-compulsive 34 \nPanic disorder 39 \nGeneral anxiety 14 \nPost-traumatic stress  24 \nWeighted average 25 \n Source:  See Annex 2 \n \n  11 \nTable 5 \nAverage costs and benefits per person treated (\u00a3) \n(includes only benefits in first 2 years) \n \nCosts 750  \nBenefits to society  \nExtra output 1,100  \nMedical costs saved 300 ? \nExtra QALYs 3,300  \nTotal 4,700 ? \nBenefits to Exchequer  \nIB\/IS\/HB\/CT + Taxes 900  \nMedical costs saved 300 ? \nTotal 1,200 ? \n                                      Source:  See Annex 2 \n \n \nTable 6 \nCumulative reductions in IB\/IS and associated savings: selected years \n \nYear Number \ntreated in \nyear \nCumulative \nnumbers cured \n(and not relapsed \nby end year) \nReduced \nnumbers on \nIB\/IS \nAnnual \nsavings to \nExchequer* \n(\u00a3 billion) \n2010\/11 320k 140k 25k 0.23\n2013\/14 800k 550k 100k 0.88\n2016\/17 800k 850k 160k 1.43\n               Source:  See Annex 2  * Excludes NHS savings \n \n \n  12 \nFigure 1 \n \n \nSource: Fava et al (2004). \n  13 \nAnnex 1 \nContribution of Mental Illness to Misery \n \nThe first sentence in this article can be illustrated from the following analysis of the \nNational Child Development Study.  Participants were interviewed as adults at age 41 (in \n1999) and at age 46 (in 2004).  They were asked about their income and about how \nsatisfied they were with their lives.  They were also given a 24-item test for mental illness \n(described as a test of psychological malaise). \nTo assess the effect of mental illness on life satisfaction, we take life satisfaction \nin 2004 and see how this is affected by mental illness in 1999 (in order to reduce the \nproblem that the question on life satisfaction may be tautologically similar to some of the \nquestions on mental illness).  We also introduce as another explanatory variable the \ncurrent level of income. \nIn both cases the explanatory factors are expressed as dummy variables.  The \nmental illness variable is a dummy which includes only the worst quarter on the tests of \npsychological malaise.  The poverty variable is a dummy which includes only the lowest \nquarter on the income question.  The resulting regression is (with t \u2013 statistics) \n \nLife satisfaction = -0.84 Mentally ill \u2013 0.60 Poor \n          (9.4)  (6.4) \n \nThe effect of being mentally ill is in this analysis more than that of being poor.  Needless \nto say, the analysis is purely illustrative. \n \n  14 \nAnnex 2 \n \nMix of conditions assumed (%) \nDepression: 45;  Phobia: 5;   Obsessive compulsive disorder : 5; \nPanic Disorder: 5;  General anxiety disorder: 30;  Post-traumatic stress disorder: 10. \nThese weights are used in all analyses. \n \nBased on ONS, Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, Table 2.7, with an allowance for \nPTSD which is not identified in the PMS but may affect 3.4% of the population.  \nSome judgment is exercised. Throughout the analysis the only data used on phobia \nare for social phobia and agoraphobia.  \n \nTable 1 \n Based on data in NICE guidelines. Recovery rates denote proportion recovered by \nend of 4 months among those who were retained. Recovery means loss of specified \ndiagnosis or reliable and   clinically significant change (when the former is not \navailable).  \n \ncol (4) = col (1) x (col (2) \u2013 col (3)) \n \nTable 2  \n Cols (1) + (2) \n All except depression \nAssume natural recovery rate per 4 months for all people not recovered by \nthe end of the treatment period is one half of the rates shown in Table 1 for \nrecovery rates during the period. (This is because natural recovery rates are \nhigher soon after the onset of illness.  See Bruce et al in American Journal of \nPsychiatry, June 2005.) \n \n \n \n Depression \n We assume that, if untreated, depression lasts 9 months. After recovery, \nsubsequent health is as shown in Figure 1, with subsequent natural recovery \noccurring again after 9 months. \n \n Col (3) \n The Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2000, shows the employment rates (Ni) of people \nwith each disorder i and with no disorder (No) \u2013 see Table 3. We assume that, for \npeople who had disorder i and now do not, the employment rate increases by 0.6 (No \n- Ni).  \n \n Cols (4) and (5) \n \n Cols (1) and (2) multiplied by Col (3) \u2013 except in the bottom row. \n \n  15 \nTable 3 \n Psychiatric Morbidity Survey.  PTSD is equated to depression \n \nTable 4 \n See Table 3. \n \nTable 5 \n  See text.  Output gains allow for increased employment and reduced absenteeism. \nHere again we use the coefficient of 0.6. The estimates of months off IB are based \non extra months healthy times 0.6 times the difference between IB and \/ or IS rates \nfor \u2018ill\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 people.21  The estimates of extra taxes are based on extra \nmonths in work. \n \nTable 6 \n See above assumptions.  Note that the programme is assumed to begin in 2008\/9 \n \n                                                 \n21 This is slightly more than extra months in work times the proportion of mentally-ill inactive people on IB \nand \/ or IS.  This is because some people are off IB without being in work. \n  16 \nReferences \n \nBailey, W. C., Richards, J. M., Brooks, C. M., Soong, S. J., Windsor, R. A. and Manzella, \nB. A.
