For instance, in laboratory studies, fish with a high cortisol 25 \nresponse show a greater propensity for stress induced anorexia. Some authors have, however, 26 \ncommented that controlled studies encompassing relatively small groups of fish hold little or 27 \nno relevance to practical aquaculture. This notion may be flawed, since understanding the 28 \nmechanisms behind the behaviour of individuals is a proviso to predict behaviour in groups 29 \neven with the caveat that some behaviors may be modified by group size. As an example, 30 \noptimal feeding regimes should be easier to predict in a population consisting of individuals 31 \nwhose appetite is relatively less affected by external stressors. In a fluctuating and potentially 32 \nstressful environment, such a population should also generate less feed waste, if kept on fixed 33 \nrations. In the present experiment, we tested this hypothesis by monitoring feed waste and 34 \nfeed conversion efficiency in lines of rainbow trout selected for a low (LR) or high (HR) 35 \ncortisol response to stress. The study was carried out after fish had been transported between 36 \nrearing sites in the United Kingdom and Norway. There was significantly more feed waste 37 \nfrom rearing units containing HR fish, and these fish also showed lower feed efficiency 38 \n(growth per unit feed consumed). The difference in feed waste became more apparent with 39 \nincreasing time after transport, as rations increased. Simultaneously, size was more variable 40 \nand growth was slower in HR rearing units. These results suggest that there are several 41 \npotential benefits of selection for low stress responsiveness in aquaculture.  42 \n 43 \n 44 \n 45 \n 46 \n1. Introduction 47 \nIntensive aquaculture of salmonid fish is a relatively new innovation, compared to the 48 \ncultivation of most other animals. The process of domestication has only just begun in 49 \nsalmonids, and considerable effort is devoted to selecting for and estimating the heritability 50 \nof economically important traits in these fish, such as growth rate, size at maturity, muscle 51 \ncomposition, and disease resistance (see e.g. Gjerde, 1993; Gj\u00f8en and Bentsen 1997; 52 \nGjedrem, 2000; Midtlyng et al., 2002).  53 \nFish under intensive culture conditions are exposed to a regime of both acute and 54 \nchronic stressors, which have adverse effects on growth, immunocompetence, and flesh 55 \nquality, among other things (Barton et al., 1987; Barton and Iwama, 1991; Balm, 1997; 56 \nSigholt et al., 1997; Schreck et al., 2001; Pottinger, 2001). As in other vertebrates, the blood 57 \nconcentration of corticosteroid hormones is used as an index of stress in fish, and elevated 58 \nlevels of these hormones arise from activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) 59 \naxis (Wendelaar-Bonga, 1997). The main corticosteroid in teleosts is cortisol (Kime, 1987), 60 \nand this steroid is a causal factor in many of the deleterious effects of stress (Barton et al., 61 \n1987; Barton and Iwama, 1991; Harris and Bird, 2000; Pankhurst and Van der Kraak, 2000; 62 \nSchreck et al., 2001; Bernier et al., 2004).  63 \nIn rainbow trout the magnitude of the cortisol response to stress is an individual 64 \ncharacteristic which is stable over time, with a moderate to high degree of heritability 65 \n(Pottinger et al., 1992, 1994; Fevolden et al., 1999). Thus, post-stress cortisol levels provide 66 \na trait of functional significance upon which selection pressure can be directed, and lines of 67 \nhigh- (HR) and low-responsive (LR) trout have been established at the Windermere 68 \nlaboratory of the UK Natural Environment Research Council, Centre for Ecology and 69 \nHydrology (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999).  70 \nSelection for cortisol responsiveness is associated with a range of behavioural 71 \ndifferences between the HR and LR trout lines (reviewed by \u00d8verli et al., 2005). Specifically, 72 \nLR fish show a tendency to become socially dominant (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001), a rapid 73 \nrecovery of food intake after transfer to a novel environment (\u00d8verli et al., 2002), and a 74 \nreduced locomotor response in a territorial intrusion test (\u00d8verli et al., 2002). Experiments 75 \nwith non-selected aquaculture populations of rainbow trout later showed that large variation 76 \nin the cortisol response to stress also exists in such populations, and cortisol responsiveness 77 \npredicts behaviour in a number of situations (\u00d8verli et al., 2004, 2006).  78 \n The above associations between individual variation in stress responsiveness and 79 \nbehaviour have all been revealed in laboratory studies encompassing relatively low numbers 80 \nof fish. There seems to be a strong notion, at least in some research milieus, that tightly 81 \ncontrolled small-scale studies hold little or no relevance to practical aquaculture. We will 82 \nargue, however, that proper understanding of mechanisms behind the behaviour of individual 83 \nfish is a proviso to comprehend behaviour in groups. The latter a viewpoint is supported by 84 \nrecent work on the relative growth of the HR and LR selected fish over several years and two 85 \ngenerations at near-production scale (Pottinger, 2006). In this study, the performance of the 86 \ntwo lines in co-culture was found to be consistent with what might be predicted on the basis 87 \nof the relative competitiveness\/aggressiveness of the fish in smaller scale studies.  88 \n While the conclusions are so far equivocal with regard to the value of directly 89 \nexploiting the LR line, several potential benefits of selection for reduced stress 90 \nresponsiveness in aquaculture can be nonetheless be identified. For instance, the amount of 91 \nfeed waste from a rearing unit, and the efficiency with which feed is transformed to somatic 92 \ngrowth, are economically and environmentally important factors that may be affected by 93 \nstress responsiveness. Optimal feeding regimes should be easier to predict in a population 94 \nconsisting of individuals whose appetite is less affected by external stressors. In a fluctuating 95 \nand potentially stressful environment, such a population should also generate less feed waste, 96 \nif kept on fixed rations. 97 \n Transport of live fish is a common procedure in aquaculture and fisheries 98 \nmanagement that exposes fish to multiple stressors, which may in turn cause production loss 99 \n(see e.g. Iversen et al., 2005, and references therein). It is likely that an effect of heritable 100 \nvariation in stress responsiveness on feed utilisation would be particularly evident following 101 \nexposure to a stressful procedure such as transport.  To test this hypothesis, we monitored 102 \nfeed waste, growth, and conversion efficiency in HR and LR trout rearing units during twelve 103 \ndays after fish had been transported between the original rearing site (Windermere, UK) and 104 \na research station in Norway.  105 \n 106 \n2. Material and methods 107 \nExperimental fish and procedures: The selection procedure yielding the HR and LR trout 108 \nlines and the effect of the breeding program on cortisol responsiveness has been described in 109 \ndetail elsewhere (Pottinger and Carrick 1999, 2001), and will only be briefly reviewed here. 110 \nThe parental generation of the HR and LR trout lines was established in 1996 by repeated 111 \nstress testing (3h confinement in 50 L water in groups of 6-7 individuals once monthly) of 112 \npassive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged 2-year-old rainbow trout. The mean post-stress 113 \nplasma cortisol content across five episodes of confinement was calculated for each fish, and 114 \nindividuals were ranked accordingly. Between testing, fish were kept in groups of 25 in 1500 115 \nL holding tanks, and the four most high-responding (HR) and the four most low-responding 116 \n(LR) fish in each tank were removed from their home tank, segregated by sex, and kept 117 \nseparate in 4 tanks based on group (HR, LR) and sex until maturation.  118 \n The 1st generation offspring (F1) consisted of 15 HR and 14 LR families each 119 \nresulting from a unique male-female crossing. A highly significant regression of mid-parent 120 \ncortisol response on progeny response was seen (estimated r2 [h2] value = 0.41), and the six 121 \nLR families with the lowest mean cortisol response and the six HR families with the highest 122 \nmean cortisol response were identified and used for further work (Pottinger and Carrick, 123 \n1999). In the current experiment, 150 PIT-tagged fish from the third generation of offspring 124 \nfrom each population (weight HR: 493\u00b112 g, LR: 477\u00b19 g, mean \u00b1 SE) were starved for 5 125 \ndays and loaded on a tank truck equipped to keep water fully oxygenated during transport 126 \n(Donslund Special Transport, Hejnsvig, Denmark, http:\/\/www.donslund.dk). Water 127 \ntemperature was 14\u00baC at departure from Windermere, increasing to 18\u00baC during transport. On 128 \narrival at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research marine research station (Solbergstrand, 129 \nAkershus county, Norway) two days later, all fish except 12 HR and 12 LR individuals used 130 \nfor another study were again weighed and distributed in 3 HR and 3 LR rearing units (tank 131 \nvolume 0.9 m3,  water flow 30 l \/ min, 15-17\u00baC). HR and LR fish were not separated during 132 \nthe transport, but were sorted upon arrival based on PIT-tag readings. No mortalities 133 \noccurred during the transfer. 134 \n Three days after arrival, a feeding regime was initiated in which all rearing units were 135 \nhand fed a ration corresponding to 0.5% of the biomass (B.M.) present in that tank 136 \n(Skretting, Standard Expanded 60). Feed was distributed once daily over a 20 min period. 137 \nAfter three days, rations were increased to 1% B.M. \/ day, and after another 3 days to 2% 138 \nB.M. \/ day. All rearing units were equipped with PVC grid pellet traps at the water outlet, 139 \nand uneaten pellets were collected and counted each day 15 min after termination of feeding. 140 \nAt this point in time, it was visually confirmed that all food had either been consumed or 141 \ntrapped. Quantification of uneaten food was stopped after 6 days of feeding at the 2% level, 142 \ni.e. 12 days after feeding was initiated. At this point, all fish were again weighed and growth 143 \nrates were calculated. 144 \n Data analysis: The feed waste from each rearing unit during the course of the 145 \nexperiment was recorded daily. Mean values for the amount of accumulated feed waste 146 \nreleased by HR (n=3) and LR (n=3) rearing units were then expressed as a regression over 147 \ntime. The rate of increase in accumulated feed waste was compared between HR and LR 148 \nlines using the method suggested by Armitage (1980) to test whether the regression slopes 149 \nwere different (using the t-statistics), and whether the lines were significantly separated 150 \n(using the t-statistics for adjusted constants). The latter test corresponds to a co-variance 151 \nanalysis using lineage (HR, LR) as independent variable, accumulated feed waste as 152 \ndependent variable, and time (days of feeding) as co-variate. Total feed waste from the two 153 \npopulations during the whole experiment was also calculated as the percentage of the food 154 \ndelivered to each tank, and compared using two-sided t-test. Two-sided t-tests were also used 155 \nto compare biomass, size variation (coefficient of variance, CV), growth rates, and feed 156 \nefficiency ratio (FER = growth \/ feed consumed) between the two lines. Relationships 157 \nbetween relevant variables (see the results section) were tested using Pearsson correlation. 158 \n 159 \n3. Results 160 \nFish size, growth rates, and feed efficiency: In the following, data are reported as mean \u00b1 161 \nS.E.M., and p values are the result of two-sided t-test unless otherwise stated. There was no 162 \nsignificant difference in average fish size between the two populations prior to transport (HR: 163 \n493\u00b112 g, LR: 477\u00b19 g, p=0.25), or upon arrival in Norway (HR: 456\u00b112 g, LR: 442\u00b19 g, 164 \np=0.44). There was a trend towards larger CV's for initial size in HR than LR rearing units 165 \n(HR: 26.6\u00b11.9, LR: 23.2\u00b10.6, p=0.16). Growth rates during the feeding experiment were, on 166 \naverage, higher in the LR than in the HR rearing units (HR: 2.1\u00b10.1 % B.W. \/ day, LR: 167 \n2.6\u00b10.05 % B.W. \/ day, p=0.02). This difference was not fully explained by higher feed 168 \nwaste in HR rearing units (see below), because there was also a significant difference in feed 169 \nefficiency (growth\/feed consumed) between the two populations (FCR HR: 1.53\u00b10.1, 170 \nLR:1.86\u00b10.04, p=0.03).  171 \n Feed waste: Accumulation of feed waste under the three different feeding regimes is 172 \nshown in figure 1. Data for the two populations were distributed along two separate 173 \nregression lines under all three feeding regimes, with significant differences between mean y 174 \nin all cases, and slopes significantly different at the 1.0% and 2.0% feeding regimes, but not 175 \nunder the initial 0.5% regime. Hence, feed waste accumulated more rapidly from HR rearing 176 \nunits in the final stages of the experiment, when rations were higher. Total feed waste during 177 \nthe whole experiment was also calculated in relative terms (percentage of distributed feed 178 \nlost) and compared between populations by unpaired t-test (figure 2). Despite the relatively 179 \nlow number of rearing units, total feed waste was also significantly higher from the HR 180 \nrearing units (p=0.03).  181 \n Relationship between size variation and feed waste: The fact that the cumulative 182 \ndifference in feed waste between the two lines increased with time after transport suggests 183 \nthat stress induced reductions in feed intake were not the only factor underlying the greater 184 \nfeed waste from the HR rearing units. As noted above, there was a trend towards a larger 185 \nvariation in fish size in the HR rearing units. We therefore analysed whether there was a 186 \ncorrelation between initial size variation and total feed waste from the different rearing units. 187 \nThere was a strong trend towards such a relationship in pooled data from HR and LR rearing 188 \nunits (p=0.08, figure 3). 189 \n 190 \nDiscussion 191 \nThese data demonstrate conclusively that during a 12 day period after transport between two 192 \nrearing sites, feed waste from rearing units holding LR fish was lower than that from units 193 \ncontaining HR fish. This observation is consistent with an earlier study, in which it was 194 \ndemonstrated that LR fish tend to resume feed intake more rapidly than HR fish in a new 195 \nenvironment (\u00d8verli et al., 2002). Furthermore, in the present study LR fish yielded more 196 \ngrowth from each unit of food they consumed. Previous studies carried out at the original 197 \nWindermere rearing site found no significant difference in growth between the lines when 198 \nthey were reared in separate tanks (Pottinger, 2006). Hence, at present it is not known if LR 199 \nand HR fish also utilize feed resources differently under more undisturbed and stable 200 \nconditions. It should be noted, however, that in the present study the difference in feed waste 201 \nbetween the two lines appeared to increase with time after transport. This may be a 202 \nconsequence of the fact that rations were increased with time, or indicate that different feed 203 \nutilisation is a permanent characteristic of the HR and LR rainbow trout lines. The latter 204 \nexplanation may seem the less likely, since in a previous study no significant difference in 205 \ngrowth was detected over time between HR and LR lines held separately for longer periods 206 \nof time (Pottinger, 2006). An alternative explanation for this discrepancy could be that 207 \ndivergence in trait characters has been amplified in the subsequent generation of HR and LR 208 \nfish that was utilised in the present study.    209 \n In salmonids, appetite inhibition is a prominent behavioural response to stress and 210 \naversive experience, which is in part mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones that are 211 \nalso involved in control of the physiological stress response (\u00d8verli et al., 1998; Bernier and 212 \nPeter, 2001; Carr, 2002; Bernier et al., 2004). It is, however, not immediately clear that 213 \nincreased feed waste from the HR rearing units depends only on stress induced anorexia in 214 \nthese fish. Stress responsiveness is also linked to aggressive behaviour and social dominance 215 \n(Pottinger and Carrick, 2001; \u00d8verli et al., 2004, 2005; Schjolden et al., 2005), and may 216 \nthereby affect the structure of social hierarchies. Social interactions are in turn an important 217 \nfactor in the distribution and utilisation of feed resources (e.g. Jobling and Wandsvik, 1983; 218 \nMcCarthy et al., 1992). In the present experiment, there was no initial difference in mean 219 \nbody weight between HR and LR fish. On the other hand, HR fish were somewhat more 220 \nheterogeneous in size at the beginning of the experiment. Furthermore, the data suggested a 221 \npositive relationship between initial variance in body weight and feed waste resulting from a 222 \nrearing unit (c.f. figure 3).  223 \n In light of the above, it would appear that homogenous populations generate less feed 224 \nwaste. It should, however, be noted that the number of rearing units in this experiment was 225 \ntoo low to reveal whether there also was such a relationship within each population. Hence, 226 \nthese data only demonstrate that there was some correspondence between the magnitude of 227 \nthe difference in feed waste and enhanced size heterogeneity in the HR population, and does 228 \nnot constitute proof of a cause-effect relationship. The correlation should nevertheless be 229 \ntaken in concern to remind us that there are several plausible backgrounds for the association 230 \nbetween increased feed waste and high stress responsiveness.  231 \n  It should also be kept in mind that these measurements were made in a period 232 \nfollowing transport and starvation. Compensatory growth in salmonid fish appears to involve 233 \nboth increased feed intake and improved feed efficiency (Miglavs and Jobling, 1989; Jobling 234 \nand Koskela, 1996, Boujard et al., 2000). Hence, our results are in line with recent reports 235 \ndemonstrating that feed conversion efficiency may have a substantial genetic component 236 \n(Thodesen et al., 2001; Silverstein et al., 2005; Mambrini et al., 2006). 237 \n  In summary, the present study suggests that both improved FCR and reduced feed 238 \nwaste are among the potential benefits selection for stress responsiveness could have on the 239 \nproduction of salmonid fish in aquaculture. It should be kept in mind, however, that the present 240 \nstudy was carried out after a significant transport stressor, coupled with exposure to a wholly 241 \nnovel environment. In this situation, the results clearly showed that LR fish were able to regain 242 \ngrowth more rapidly after transport than HR fish. A reduction in the adverse effects on 243 \nperformance induced by the imposition of unavoidable stressors is likely to be among the 244 \npotential benefits selection for stress responsiveness offers for the production of salmonid fish 245 \nin aquaculture. Finally, it should be noted that there was close correspondence between the 246 \nactual results obtained under conditions of intensive group rearing and the predictions made 247 \nfrom previous, small-scale laboratory research. This observation underlines the importance of a 248 \nfunctional interface between applied research and fundamental studies on the biology of 249 \nspecies currently undergoing domestication.    250 \n 251 \nAcknowledgements 252 \nThis study was supported by the Norwegian Research Council and institutional funds from the 253 \nNorwegian University of Life Science.
