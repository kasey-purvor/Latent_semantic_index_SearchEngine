Design: Retrospective study of population-wide, patient level data using ordinary least squares regression to investigate the statistical relation between waiting times and patients\u2019 socioeconomic status. Setting: English NHS from 1997 to 2007. Participants: 427 277 patients who had elective knee replacement, 406 253 who had elective hip replacement, and 2 568 318 who had elective cataract repair.
