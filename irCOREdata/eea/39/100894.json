The oxidation of carbon\nmonoxide on Pt\u0005100\u0006, which follows a Langmuir-\nHinshelwood mechanism,5 is a well researched process that\nfalls in this category.6\nThe clean Pt\u0005100\u0006 surface can be prepared in a meta-\nstable ideal bulk-terminated \u00011\u00011\u0002 structure at 300 K. On\nheating above 500 K the surface restructures to a more stable\narrangement, in which the top layer adopts a quasihexagonal\nstructure and the second layer retains the square array of the\n\u0005100\u0006 surface. This phase is referred to as Pt\u0005100\u0006-hex.7 The\nenergy difference between the two clean solid surfaces has\nbeen measured calorimetrically and found to be 20 kJ\/mol\nof surface platinum atoms \u0001and equivalent to 0.21 eV per\n1\u00011 area\u0002.8 This procedure relies on the fact that adsorption\nof several gases can induce or lift the surface reconstruction,\nthereby allowing the construction of thermodynamic cycles\nthat provide a direct measurement of the heat of reconstruc-\ntion.\nAt surface temperatures above 380 K adsorption of CO\non Pt\u0005100\u0006-hex leads to a lifting of the reconstruction.9\u201311\nThe rate of transformation to the 1\u00011 phase follows a non-\nlinear growth power law in terms of the local coverage of\nCO on the hex phase, \u0002CO\nhex\n.\n9\u201311 The rate of 1\u00011 island\ngrowth is given by rg\u0001\u0002\u0002=k\u0001\u0002CO\nhex\u00024.17, where k is the rate con-\nstant, and shows no dependence on substrate temperature.\nThis strong nonlinearity results in a flux-dependent sticking\nprobability for CO.12 The growth rate was also shown to be\nindependent of the exposure history and of the coverage of\nthe 1\u00011 phase, \u00021\u00011.\n10 Thiel et al.13 have shown that the\nsurface phase transformation leads to the formation of CO-\ndense islands on the 1\u00011 phase, with a CO coverage of\nabout 0.5 ML \u0001where 1 ML corresponds to the Pt atom den-a\u0002Electronic mail: r.hoyle@surrey.ac.uk\nTHE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 127, 164711 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-9606\/2007\/127\u000216\u0001\/164711\/14\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics127, 164711-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Since the nonlinear growth\nrate of the 1\u00011 phase is negligible at a very low coverage of\nCO on the Pt\u0005100\u0006-hex phase \u0001i.e., \u0002CO\nhex\u00030.02 ML\u0002 and in-\nteractions between molecules can be ignored, the rate of\ndesorption of CO from the hex phase was modeled by\nrd\u0001\u0002\u0002=\u0004\u0002CO\nhexe\u2212E\/RT, where E is the desorption energy. Isother-\nmal desorption measurements found E=105 kJ\/mol of CO,\nwhile \u0004=3.7\u00011012 s\u22121.14 The adsorption heat for CO on the\n1\u00011 phase is much larger \u0003E=\u2212225 kJ\/mol of CO \u0001Ref.\n13\u0002\u0004, indicating that the difference in adsorption energetics is\nthe driving force for the CO-induced lifting of the hex recon-\nstruction. Furthermore, the energy gained in converting\nPt\u0005100\u0006-hex with 0.5 ML of CO to Pt\u0005100\u0006-1\u00011 with 0.5\nML of CO is 27 kJ\/mol of surface Pt atoms. Low energy\nelectron diffraction \u0001LEED\u0002 intensity measurements have de-\ntermined the activation barrier for the conversion of the clean\nsurface from 1\u00011 to hex to be 115 kJ\/mol of surface plati-\nnum atoms.13\nFollowing Yeo et al.,8 we reproduce their schematic po-\ntential energy diagram \u0001Fig. 1\u0002 relating the clean surface\nphases and the two CO-covered surface phases. The integral\nheats of adsorption shown here are 105 and 85 kJ\/mol of\nsurface platinum atoms for the 1\u00011 and hex surfaces, re-\nspectively. The activation barrier for diffusion\/trapping of\nCO from the hex to the 1\u00011 phase is unknown but it is\nbelieved to be very small and taken as zero in our modeling\nsince it proceeds even at 100 K. The activation energy for\nCO migration\/untrapping from 1\u00011 to hex is, however,\ntaken to be the difference between the CO desorption ener-\ngies from each. We use the value E=154 kJ\/mol \u0001at \u0002=0\u0002\nadopted by Hopkinson and King11 for the desorption energy\nfrom the 1\u00011 phase, and so the activation energy for CO\nuntrapping is 49 kJ mol\u22121.\nWe are going to concentrate now on modeling what is\nobserved during the oxidation of CO on Pt\u0005100\u0006. In a recent\nletter,15 we summarized numerical simulation results from\nthe first faithful reaction-diffusion model to describe pattern\nformation in this system on experimentally realistic length\nand time scales. In this article, we focus on the derivation of\nthe reaction-diffusion equations that define our model and\npresent the results of numerical integrations and comparison\nwith experiments in detail.\nAt pressures where global coupling of the surface\nthrough the gas phase is important the flux-dependent CO\nsticking probability maintains an in-phase behavior in the\nmacroscopic properties across the whole crystal surface.9\u201311\nThis manifests itself as regular and irregular self-maintaining\noscillations of integral properties such as the rate of reaction\nand work function changes across the whole crystal\nsurface.1,16\u201318 However, in certain pressure regimes, spatial\nstructure and self-organization have been observed by vari-\nous surface imaging techniques to accompany the oscilla-\ntions in the macroscopic reaction rate.2\u20134,19 This typically\ntakes the form of continuously varying patches of predomi-\nnantly oxygen- and CO-covered surface whose arrangement\nchanges in time through the passage of traveling reaction\nwaves. These waves are of two types: relatively slow-\nmoving CO fronts, at which the 1\u00011 to hex phase relaxation\noccurs, and faster oxygen fronts not accompanied by phase\nchange.\nTo be able to build a macroscopic account of the spa-\ntiotemporal behavior of this reactive system, all the informa-\ntion available at the microscopic level is required. This in-\ncludes the above description of adsorption of CO at the two\nclean phases of Pt\u0005100\u0006, information on the dissociative ad-\nsorption of O2 at the surface and the other microscopic\nevents that take place, as summarized by the following reac-\ntion scheme:\nCOgas + Pt\u0005100\u0006hex\u21d4\nk1,k2\nCOhex, \u00011\u0002\nCOgas + Pt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002\u21d4\nk1,k3\nCO1\u00011, \u00012\u0002\nCOhex + Pt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002\u21d4\nk4,k5\nCO1\u00011 + Pt\u0005100\u0006hex, \u00013\u0002\n1\n2O2gas + Pt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002\u2014\u2014\u2192\nk6\nO1\u00011, \u00014\u0002\nnCOhex + mPt\u0005100\u0006hex\u2014\u2014\u2192\nk8\nnCO1\u00011\n+ mPt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002 , \u00015\u0002\nPt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002\u2014\u2014\u2192\nk9\nPt\u0005100\u0006hex. \u00016\u0002\nFinally, the reactive step is given by\nCO1\u00011 + O1\u00011\u2014\u2014\u2192\nk7\nCO2gas + 2Pt\u0005100\u0006\u00011\u0001 1\u0002 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere surface chemisorbed species are denoted by the sub-\nscripts hex and 1\u00011 and the gaseous species by gas.\nThe adsorption probability of O2 on the Pt\u0005100\u0006-hex\nphase is less than 0.001 and is taken to be negligible in our\nFIG. 1.

Desorption of CO takes place in the\ntemperature range of interest \u0001450\u2013530 K\u0002, while oxygen\ndesorption can be neglected under these conditions.16\nThe rates of migration of CO from the hex phase onto\nthe 1\u00011 phase \u0001trapping\u0002 and that of the reverse process\n\u0001untrapping\u0002, both described by Eq. \u00013\u0002, depend on the rela-\ntive length of the boundary between the hex and 1\u00011 areas,\nB. The parameter B has been modeled by fitting a set of\ndifferential equations describing the interaction of CO with\nboth phases of Pt\u0005100\u0006 and was found to be a constant, in-\ndependent of coverage, for a wide range of CO fluxes.11,12 In\naccordance with this model, we choose B to be 1. The con-\nstancy of B suggests a highly anisotropic 1\u00011 island\ngrowth,11,12 which is supported by more recent scanning tun-\nneling microscopy experiments by Borg et al.23 who found\nmuch faster growth along the \u000301\u00af1\u0004 direction than along the\n\u0003011\u0004 direction at 300 K for an initial Pt\u0005100\u0006-hex surface\nrotated by 0.7\u00b0.\nThe growth of 1\u00011 islands does not occur by the accre-\ntion of individual CO molecules as they diffuse to the island\nboundaries:9\u201311 instead, four CO molecules on the hex phase\nare involved in the concerted conversion of a patch of hex to\n1\u00011 during the nucleation and growth of the 1\u00011 islands.\nSince the 1\u00011 phase forms as 0.5 ML dense CO islands, this\nimplies that the minimum number of surface Pt atoms in-\nvolved in surface restructuring is eight \u0001i.e., m\u00058\u0002.\nData available from experimental studies and used in our\nmodel are shown in Table I. We use the same parameters as\nGruyters et al.,21 who, in turn, adopted many of them from\nHopkinson and King.11 The coverage-dependent sticking\nprobabilities of CO and oxygen on the 1\u00011 phase are\nadapted from experimental data as in Ref. 24. We use the\nsticking probability of oxygen on \u201cfreed\u201d sites, recently\nmade available by CO desorption or CO2 formation21 for\nSO2\n1\u00011\n.\nKINETIC RATE EQUATIONS\nThe kinetic rate equations describing the reaction\nscheme given in Eqs. \u00011\u0002\u2013\u00017\u0002 take standard chemical kinetic\nforms based on the model of Gruyters et al.,21 except that we\nexplicitly consider the fraction of sites available to adsorp-\ntion, trapping, and untrapping processes, and that we ignore\nthe distinction between free and freed sites as this does not\nseem to be important in our model. Furthermore, our revised\nmodel explicitly couples the phase transition with surface\ndiffusion, thereby allowing the development of a spatially\nextended model, and takes into account the detailed experi-\nmental evidence regarding the reaction kinetics.\nWe write \u0002hex and \u00021\u00011 for the coverages of hex and 1\n\u00011 phase, respectively \u0001i.e., the fractions of the surface in\neach of these phases\u0002, and we, therefore, have \u0002hex+\u00021\u00011\n=1. We then write \u0002CO\nhex\n, \u0002CO\n1\u00011\n, and \u0002O\n1\u00011 for the local adsor-\nbate coverages on the hex \u0001i.e., \u0002hex\u0002 and 1\u00011 \u0001i.e., \u00021\u00011\u0002\nphases. Finally, we denote by \u0002e\nhex and \u0002e\n1\u00011 the local cover-\nages of empty sites on the hex and 1\u00011 phases, respectively,\nsuch that the local coverages satisfy\n\u0002CO\nhex + \u0002e\nhex\n= 1,\n\u00018\u0002\n\u0002CO\n1\u00011 + \u0002O\n1\u00011 + \u0002e\n1\u00011\n= 1.\nThe rate equations15 are given by\nTABLE I.

We discuss the derivation of these new terms\nin detail in the following section.\nGas global coupling can easily be introduced to account\nfor variations in the partial pressures of CO and O2, which\nresult from inflow and outflow of reactants as well as reac-\ntion. However, since gas global coupling was found to be\ninsignificant in the very low pressure range that we consider,\nas shown by experiment,1,4,18,19 we have chosen not to in-\nclude it in our model and have considered the partial pres-\nsures to be fixed, independent of time. We note, however,\nthat at intermediate pressures, long-range coupling through\nthe gas phase is necessary for global rate oscillations on\nPt\u0005100\u0006 \u0001Ref. 19\u0002 and at low pressures on Pt\u0005110\u0006 single crys-\ntals and polycrystalline platinum foils.26,27 Lele and\nLauterbach19 found for Pt\u0005100\u0006 that the nonlinear phenomena\ninvolved at the low pressures investigated in our study are\nmarkedly different from those operating at intermediate pres-\nsures, where they concluded that the phase transition may no\nlonger be the driving force for rate oscillations. They sug-\ngested instead a mechanism involving the formation of sub-\nsurface oxygen under these higher pressure conditions. The\nimportance of subsurface oxygen in pattern formation at in-\ntermediate pressures has been confirmed by recent ellipsomi-\ncroscopy for surface imaging experiments.25\nMESOSCOPIC MODEL\nA detailed explanation of the surface density modifica-\ntion and diffusion terms introduced in our model are given in\nthe following subsections. Our aim is to perform a numerical\nintegration in space and time of Eqs. \u00019\u0002\u2013\u000112\u0002, leading to a\nspatiotemporal description of the reactive process. In order to\ninclude diffusion, we divide the surface domain of integra-\ntion into a grid of cells, as shown in Fig. 2, each containing\nFIG. 2. The division of the surface into cells. Left: 1D cell model. Right: 2D\nmodel.\n164711-4 Anghel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 127, 164711 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The cell size is intermediate be-\ntween that of incipient hex and 1\u00011 phase patches and the\nmuch longer scale on which pattern formation occurs. We\nrefer to models involving diffusion between cells along the x\naxis only as one dimensional \u00011D\u0002, while those permitting\ndiffusion along both x and y axes are two dimensional \u00012D\u0002,\nwhere x and y refer to the dimensions in the cell length and\nwidth directions, respectively.\nThe 1D integrations are performed on a ribbon of area\nA=L\tx\ty=3600 \nm2, where L=100, while the 2D integra-\ntions are performed on a domain of length L\tx and width\nL\ty, with area A=L2\tx\ty=3.6\u0001105 \nm2. The domain is\ntaken to be spatially periodic in the x direction in the 1D\ncase, and in both x and y directions in the 2D case: in other\nwords, there is a repeat of the domain and the surface pat-\nterns within it at each boundary. The numerical integration\nuses Adams-Bashforth time stepping and second-order spa-\ntial finite differences. The same-phase diffusion leads to spa-\ntial coupling between cells and is derived below for the case\nwhere \tx and \ty are equal.\nSurface density changes at phase change\nThe adsorbate-induced hex to 1\u00011 phase change de-\nscribed by Eq. \u000112\u0002 for c\u0001\u0002\u0002\u00051 leads to a change in the\ndensity of surface sites and, hence, to a change in the fraction\nof sites occupied by CO in each of the two phases. Equations\n\u00019\u0002\u2013\u000111\u0002 include terms that take this into account. At phase\nchange on a crystal of area A, in a short time interval \tt, an\narea A\t\u00021\u00011 of 1\u00011 surface is created and a corresponding\narea, A\u0001\u2212\t\u0002hex\u0002=A\t\u00021\u00011, of hex surface is destroyed. The\narea taken up by CO on the destroyed hex surface was\nA\u0002CO\nhex\u0001\u2212\t\u0002hex\u0002=A\u0002CO\nhex\t\u00021\u00011. This is lost in the surface restruc-\nturing, so the change in the area covered by CO on hex phase\nis \t\u0001A\u0002CO\nhex\u0002hex\u0002=\u2212A\u0002CO\nhex\t\u00021\u00011. Therefore, from the phase\nchange alone we have\n\u0005\u0001\u0002CO\nhex\u0002hex\u0002\n\u0005t\n= \u2212 \u0002CO\nhex\u0005\u00021\u00011\n\u0005t\n. \u000114\u0002\nThe additional area occupied by the CO on the 1\u00011\nphase \u0001assuming that all displaced CO from the destroyed\nhex patch ends up on the 1\u00011 phase\u0002 is\nA\u0002CO\nhex\t\u00021\u00011a1\u00011 \/ahex, where a1\u00011 is the area occupied by a\n1\u00011 site and ahex is the area occupied by a hex site. We take\na1\u00011 \/ahex to be about 1.25, since about 20% of atoms are\ndisplaced during the phase change28 and 1\/0.8=1.25. Hence,\nfrom the phase change alone, we have\n\u0005\u0001\u0002CO\n1\u00011\u00021\u00011\u0002\n\u0005t\n= 1.25\u0002COhex\n\u0005\u00021\u00011\n\u0005t\n. \u000115\u0002\nThe process is reversed during the relaxation of the 1\n\u00011 surface to hex phase, described by Eq. \u000112\u0002, when c\u0001\u0002\u0002\n\u00071 and \u0005\u00021\u00011 \/\u0005t is negative.

The min function is used to ensure that the term\nis only effective when \u0005\u00021\u00011 \/\u0005t is negative.\nSame-phase diffusion\nCarbon monoxide can diffuse on both hex and 1\u00011 sur-\nfaces, whereas oxygen is relatively immobile at the tempera-\ntures used in our model. The dominant contribution from CO\ndiffusion will come from molecules moving from one hex\nsite to another nearby hex site or from a 1\u00011 site to another\n1\u00011 site. This is because hex and 1\u00011 sites are only close\nenough together for diffusion to occur between them at the\nboundaries of patches, and most sites lie in the interior of a\npatch rather than on the boundary \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002.\nHence, for diffusion on the hex phase, a CO molecule\nmust be untrapped at one hex site and retrapped at another\nhex site nearby. Most of the CO that is untrapped will be\nretrapped in the same cell, but let us say that a certain pro-\nportion \u000b migrates between cells. \u0001In what follows, we con-\nsider the 2D model; the 1D case is analogous.\u0002 The rate of\nuntrapping in the donor cell \u0001i , j\u0002 will be proportional to the\ndensity of CO on the hex phase there, \u0002CO\u0001i,j\u0002\nhex\n, and the rate of\nretrapping in the nearest neighbor \u0001up, down, left, and right\u0002\ncells \u0001nn\u0002 will be proportional to the density of empty sites\non the hex phase there, 1\u2212\u0002CO\u0001nn\u0002\nhex\n. In a short time interval \tt,\nthe net change in CO coverage on the hex phase in cell \u0001i , j\u0002\nowing to diffusion alone is given by\n\t\u0001\u0002CO\nhex\u0002hex\u0002\u0001i,j\u0002 = \u2212 k\u000b\u0002CO\u0001i,j\u0002\nhex \t\n\u0001nn\u0002\n\u0002e\u0001nn\u0002\nhex \tt\n+ k\u000b\u0002e\u0001i,j\u0002\nhex \t\n\u0001nn\u0002\n\u0002CO\u0001nn\u0002\nhex \tt , \u000121\u0002\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality that is related to the\nspeed of unhindered CO migration on the hex phase.

A number of surface defects \u0001inhomoge-\nneities\u0002 of dimension \tx\ty=36 \nm2 were mimicked in the\n1D model by choosing the initial coverage conditions in cer-\ntain cells to differ from those of the rest of the surface \u0001see\nTable II\u0002 in order to model the effect of local differences in\ntopography and sticking probablities. One could also model\ndefects by, for example, modifying the sticking probabilities\npermanently in certain locations, but we would not expect\nthis to alter the types and speeds of fronts observed that are\nour focus in this study, as these are determined by the prop-\nerties of the rate equations on the bulk surface\u2014the defects\nsimply start them off. On the other hand, one would expect\nto see successive waves of fronts emerging from such per-\nsistent defects. As it is not clear exactly how to mimic de-\nfects we decided to choose a method that has the least impact\non the long-term results.\nA systematic exploration of the behavior of the system\nas a function of partial pressures was performed at a fixed\nsurface temperature of 480 K. For the simulations summa-\nrized in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002, the integration time was 1000 s, while\nthose described in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002 were continued for up to 4000 s\nin order to determine whether long-period oscillations were\npresent.\nThe presence of initial surface inhomogeneities was\nfound to affect the behavior of the system crucially and,\nunder certain conditions of reactant partial pressures, to lead\nto the formation of traveling waves. In experiments, the tem-\nporal variation of the reaction rate was found to parallel that\nof the work function, \f\r. The latter has, therefore, been used\nto monitor the occurrence of oscillatory behavior, as mea-\nsured by a Kelvin probe.1,16,18 The experimental parameter\nrange for sustained temporal oscillations was mapped by\nEiswirth et al.1 by varying the partial pressures of O2 and CO\n\u0001pO2 and pCO\u0002 at a constant surface temperature of 480 K.\nThree distinct regions of phase space were found in their\nstudy and are summarized in Fig. 4, alongside those obtained\nby our model. Maximum amplitudes were established under\nexperimental conditions whenever the CO pressure was ad-\njusted in such a way that the CO coverage in a CO atmo-\nsphere alone would be around \u0002CO=0.5. Furthermore, a de-\ncrease in pCO and temperature was found to be associated\nwith an increase in the oscillation period.18 Oscillations were\nnever found below pCO=3\u000110\u22126 Torr \u0001Ref. 1\u0002 at the range\nof surface temperatures investigated and were found to be\nmainly irregular in nature, with few regions exhibiting regu-\nlar oscillatory behavior.4,17\u201319 The irregularity of the oscilla-\ntions suggests that they are not in phase across the whole\nsurface and might signal the presence of traveling waves or\nother spatial patterns.\nThe results of our model simulations also divide the pa-\nrameter space of reactant partial pressures \u0001pO2 and pCO\u0002 into\nthree regions defined by solid lines in Fig. 4, which can be\nthought of roughly as low CO-coverage states \u0001region \u000e\u0002,\nTABLE II.

Below, we discuss the types of solution to be\nfound in each region \u0001illustrated in Figs. 5\u201310\u0002, characteriz-\ning them by the total carbon monoxide and oxygen cover-\nages of the surface, \u00021\u00011\u0002CO\n1\u00011+\u0002hex\u0002CO\nhex and \u00021\u00011\u0002O\n1\u00011\n, respec-\ntively.\nRegion \u000e, where pCO is low, corresponds to solutions\nthat evolve steadily to surfaces with low 1\u00011 and low total\nCO coverages. The final low CO state in Fig. 5 \u0001total CO\ncoverage of 0.19 at t=2999 s\u0002 also has comparatively low\n1\u00011 coverage \u00010.51\u0002 and very low total oxygen coverage\n\u00011.3\u000110\u22124\u0002.\nRegion \u0010, corresponding to high values of pCO to the\nright of region \u0011, is characterized by homogeneously high\n1\u00011 coverages, with very low total oxygen coverages and\ncomparatively high total CO coverages. For example, the\nsimulation shown in Fig. 6 has typical values of 0.93, 0.38,\nand 7.0\u000110\u22125 for the 1\u00011, total CO, and total oxygen cov-\nerages, respectively, at time t=999 s. These high CO solu-\ntions typically approach their final coverages much more\nrapidly than the low CO states in region \u000e.\nRegion \u0011 contains regular surface oscillations \u0001Fig. 7\u0002; it\nis V shaped and tilted toward higher values of pCO. The\nrange of oscillation periods was roughly 80\u20132700 s, with\nshorter periods in the midrange of pCO and for higher values\nof pO2. It is not obvious how to distinguish between very\nlong-period oscillations \u0001that might not be easy to observe\nexperimentally\u0002 and steady evolution. In Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002, we as-\nsumed that any solution that had not repeated within 1000 s\nwas steady, and in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, we compared 1000 and 3000 s\ncutoffs. As can be seen in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, a lower threshold for the\nperiod pushes the triple point between regions \u000e, \u0010, and \u0011\ntoward higher values of the two reactant partial pressures,\nimproving the match with experimental data.1 This could be\nexplained if very long-period oscillations were hard to ob-\nserve experimentally. On the other hand, longer integration\ntimes lead to a clear distinction between regions \u000e and \u0010\nbelow region \u0011 \u0003shown as a dotted-dashed line in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004\nas in experiment. This is replaced by a transition via\nmedium-CO solutions when simulations are run only for\n1000 s \u0003solid line in Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004.\nWe saw two types of propagating front in our simula-\ntions, which we denote as CO and oxygen-CO. The CO\nfronts are found for the full range of partial pressures, pro-\nvoked early on by low \u00021\u00011, \u0002O\n1\u00011\n, \u0002CO\nhex\n, and medium\/high\n\u0002CO\n1\u00011 defects in surfaces where \u00021\u00011 was initially high. Since\nthe CO fronts move quite slowly, we had to use finer 200\n\u0001200 or 200\u00011 grids in order to measure their progress\nwith sufficient accuracy that we could capture their speeds to\nwithin 10%. For low pCO and pO2 of 3.5\u000110\n\u22125 mbar and\nabove in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, we have a CO front, followed by small-\namplitude oscillations. The period of the ensuing oscillations\nis longer for lower pO2 and lower pCO \u0001in agreement with\nexperiment18\u0002. We also performed simulations using bulk ini-\ntial conditions \u00021\u00011=0.7, \u0002O\n1\u00011\n=0.95, and \u0002CO1\u00011=\u0002COhex=0.01,\nwith defects of \u00021\u00011=\u0002O\n1\u00011\n=\u0002CO\nhex\n=0.01 and \u0002CO\n1\u00011\n=0.45, and\nfound a range of CO front speeds from 0.13 to 14 \nm s\u22121\ncompared with 2\u201350 \nm s\u22121 experimentally.2,4,19 For the ex-\nample in Fig. 8, the speed is approximately 0.3 \nm s\u22121. We\nsee that the surface initially has high 1\u00011 and total oxygen\ncoverages, with an insignificant total coverage of CO. The\ndefects provoke waves of CO, at quite modest coverage,\nwhich spread out and displace the oxygen ahead. Phase re-\nlaxation takes place at the leading edge of the front, so the\nsurface is predominantly in the hex phase behind it. Once the\nfront has passed, there are low-amplitude oscillations in the\ncoverages behind it, with the total CO coverage remaining\nlow and the total oxygen coverage negligible. For high pO2\nand low pCO in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, the CO fronts travel until they meet\nanother such front but as we approach pO2 =3.5\n\u000110\u22125 mbar, they become localized close to the original de-\nFIG. 5. \u0001Color\u0002 Steady evolution to a low CO state at pO2 =3\u000110\n\u22125 mbar and pCO=1\u000110\u22126 mbar with the same initial conditions as for Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002.

For the initial conditions used in\nFig. 8, higher pCO and lower pO2 lead to lower total oxygen\ncoverage ahead of the front and higher \u00021\u00011 and total CO\ncoverages behind it, so the phase relaxation is less marked\n\u0001though, there is still a pronounced dip in 1\u00011 coverage at\nthe leading edge of the front, even when it recovers behind\u0002\nand the CO fronts move faster, supporting the argument4,19\nthat the relatively slow speed of CO waves arises from the\nphase transition at the front.\nOxygen-CO fronts are also triggered by defects and con-\nsist of a wave of CO following closely on the heels of an\noxygen wave. They are found on the lefthand side of region\n\u0011 at high pO2. When pO2 is lower, they can occur for values\nof pCO on either side of region \u0011 and also on the border\nbetween regions \u000e and \u0010, depending on the initial condi-\ntions. In region \u0011, the fronts are followed by oscillations. The\nwave speed and oscillation period are correlated: where the\noscillations are faster or slower, so are the preceding waves.\nIn our simulations, both CO and oxygen-CO fronts often\ncoexist with oscillations, so the overall reaction rate or work\nfunction oscillations will appear irregular, as is typically\nobserved.4,17\u201319 Figures 10\u0001d\u0002\u201310\u0001f\u0002 show an oxygen front\n\u0001triggered by the defect in cell 1\u0002 at the sides of the domain,\nmoving into an initial solution with high 1\u00011, medium total\nCO, and very low total oxygen coverages. The reaction wave\nremoves the adsorbed CO, and there is some phase relax-\nation at the front so the 1\u00011 coverage falls. A wave of CO\nfollows a few seconds later \u0003Figs. 10\u0001g\u0002\u201310\u0001i\u0002\u0004, removing the\noxygen in turn. After the two consecutive waves have\npassed, the surface recovers to its initial state. Similar com-\nbinations of oxygen and CO fronts have been observed in\nexperiment \u0003see Fig. 6 of Ref. 4 \u0001which also appears as Fig.\n3 of Ref. 19\u0002\u0004. During phase relaxation the 1\u00011 coverage\ndoes not fall as far as for the CO fronts discussed above, so\nthe speed of the simulated oxygen-CO fronts is higher4,19 in\nthe range of 13\u201390 \nm s\u22121. The oxygen front shown in Fig.\n10 is moving at approximately 37 \nm s\u22121 and the speed of\nthe subsequent CO front is about 36 \nm s\u22121. In comparison,\nLauterbach and Rotermund4 measured CO front speeds be-\ntween 2 and 26 \nm s\u22121 and oxygen front speeds between 50\nand 240 \nm s\u22121, though they were working at slightly higher\npartial pressures than we have used.\nComparing Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002 shows the importance of\ninitial conditions. Hysteresis appears to be present in the\nsimulations in that the bulk initial conditions influence the\nstate of the surface at long times and can shift the boundaries\nbetween regions \u000e, \u0010, and \u0011, with low initial CO coverage\nmoving them toward higher pCO and vice versa. Experimen-\ntally, pCO was repeatedly increased and decreased in order to\nconfirm the extent of region C: this led to large error bars on\nthe position of the boundaries \u0001not shown in Fig. 4\u0002, suggest-\ning that the history of the partial pressures and surface state\nis indeed important. We found that the choice of defect initial\nconditions typically determines the initial transient behavior,\nfor instance, provoking front propagation \u0001Fig. 8\u0002.

The long-term 1\u00011 coverage is\nchanged from fairly uniformly low to a profile that varies\nbetween low and medium across the surface. We did not find\nany other persistent effects of defects \u0001though, neither did we\ncarry out an exhaustive search\u0002 and hypothesize that in this\ncase, proximity to the region \u000e \/\u0010 border may be important.\nWe now compare the results of our model with experi-\nment. Eiswirth et al.1 found two nonoscillating regions, A\nand B and an intermediate region where oscillations in the\nwork function were observed. The existence region for self-\nsustaining work function oscillations, labeled as C is V\nshaped with a tilt toward higher CO pressures, in agreement\nwith our model region \u0011. However, the experimental region\nis shifted to higher pCO pressures compared to our model.\nThis might arise from a difference in the way the partial\npressures were set: while the values of pCO and pO2 are fixed\nthroughout each of our simulations, the experimental\nprotocol1 involved setting pO2 to a constant value and ini-\ntially increasing pCO in steps. The position of the experimen-\ntal region was then determined in both directions by repeat-\nedly increasing and decreasing pCO. The error bars in pCO for\nthe boundary position were large. Taking into account the\ninitial stepwise increase, it is likely that the average value of\npCO over a single run was lower than the final value used in\nplotting the experimental region and perhaps, this is impor-\ntant. If the experimental region were plotted using this lower\naverage pCO value, it would be shifted toward lower pCO,\npossibly closer to our model region \u0011. The triple point be-\ntween the three regions is also at lower pO2 in our model,\ncompared to experiment, if we use a 3000 s cutoff to distin-\nguish between steady and oscillatory solutions. Adopting a\nlower period cutoff for distinguishing between oscillatory\nand steady structures corrects this \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004, but at the ex-\npense of designating some solutions we know to be periodic\nas steady. However, it seems likely that very long-period\noscillations would be hard to observe experimentally as they\nwould be vulnerable to disruption by small fluctuations in\nexperimental conditions. Although, we stated when introduc-\ning the kinetic rate equations that adopting over the whole\n1\u00011 surface the \u0001higher\u0002 oxygen sticking probability for\nfreed rather than \u201cfree\u201d sites makes little difference in our\nmodel, it is likely to be a reason for the shift of the triple\npoint to lower pO2 since this is very sensitive to small\nFIG. 9. \u0001Color\u0002 Oxygen front followed by CO front followed by steady evolution to low CO state at pO2 =2\u000110\n\u22125 mbar and pCO=1\u000110\u22126 mbar with the\nsame initial conditions as for Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002.

Finally, the presence of a traveling wave component\nin many of our oscillatory solutions fits with the experimen-\ntal observation that work function oscillations are typically\nirregular.4,17\u201319\nFor experimental region A, where the CO pressure is\nvery low, the work function was found to be constant and\nhigh, which was interpreted in terms of excess oxygen being\npresent on the surface. This region matches well with the\nresults within region \u000e from our model, where solutions\nshow high total oxygen coverage \u0001e.g., before the passing of\nthe CO front in Fig. 8\u0002 and\/or relatively low coverage of\nchemisorbed CO that does not hinder uptake of oxygen at the\nsurface. For region B, the work function was found to be low\nand constant. This has been interpreted in terms of a high CO\ncoverage that inhibits O2 adsorption, again in agreement with\nregion \u0010 in our theory model.\nIn experiments, the periods for self-sustaining oscilla-\ntions with amplitudes in \f\r between 100 and 300 mV\nranged typically between 1 and 4 min at temperatures around\n500 K, while at lower temperatures, periods of up to 10 min\nand longer were observed. Faster oscillations, with periods\nas short as a few seconds, were found at small amplitudes.18\nOur model also finds a wide range of oscillation periods\nwithin the mapped region \u0011, from 80 s to 45 min, with the\nfastest oscillations being found in the midrange of pCO and\nfor higher pO2. The oscillations in our simulations appear to\nbe of somewhat longer period than those observed experi-\nmentally, though the partial pressures we used were typically\nsomewhat lower, which may account for the difference. In\nthe next section, we discuss our 2D simulations and compare\nthe carbon monoxide and oxygen-CO fronts we see with\nthose observed experimentally during pattern formation.\nRESULTS: 2D MODEL\nA two-dimensional CO front is shown in Fig. 12 for the\nsame partial pressures as the 1D case illustrated in Fig. 8.\nReaction fronts can be seen propagating outwards from de-\nfects at an initial speed of approximately 0.24 \nm s\u22121. Ini-\ntially, the fronts are approximately circular, but they become\ndistorted as they interact. Ahead of the wave, the surface is\npredominantly covered by oxygen on 1\u00011 phase, while be-\nhind it, the surface is in hex phase with no adsorbed oxygen\nand a modest coverage of CO. We would expect oscillations\nat low 1\u00011 and CO coverages in the wake of the front, as in\nthe 1D case. The initial wave speed is 0.24 \nm s\u22121, which is\na little slower than for the 1D case. This is possibly due to\nthe curved shape of the 2D front and the influence of other\nnearby fronts.\nIn order to investigate the structure of two-dimensional\noxygen-CO fronts, we present a series of snapshots \u0001Fig. 13\u0002\nof the 1\u00011, total CO, and total oxygen coverages between\nFIG. 11. \u0001Color\u0002 The effect of changing \u00021\u00011 from \u0001a\u0002 0.834 to \u0001b\u0002 0.01 in\ncell 1 is long lasting at pO2 =1\u000110\n\u22125 mbar and pCO=6\u000110\u22127 mbar with the\nsame remaining initial conditions as for Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002.

By t=100 s,\nlevels of CO and 1\u00011 are recovering. Although phase\nchange occurs during the passage of the combined\noxygen-CO front, it is not as dramatic and sharply defined\nspatially as in the case of the simple CO front.\nIt was difficult to make an accurate estimate of the\noxygen-CO front speeds owing to the presence of the back-\nground oscillations and the complexity of the patterns pro-\nduced by the interacting defects. Comparing oxygen cover-\nage patterns at times t=86 and 87 s, the initial oxygen wave\nappears to be traveling quite fast: between about 250 and\n300 \nm s\u22121. The subsequent CO front seems to be moving\nmore slowly, with its speed being estimated at between 10\nand 20 \nm s\u22121. It is interesting to note that the oxygen wave\nspeed is much faster than in the corresponding one-\ndimensional case \u0001Fig. 10\u0002. The curvature of the two-\ndimensional front and the influences of other defects \u0001which\nare different in the two situations\u0002 might account for this\ndifference. It appears from Fig. 13 that the residual effect of\nthe defects at cells \u00019,61\u0002 and \u000196,46\u0002 may also be important.\nWe now compare our two-dimensional simulations with\nexperiment. There are comparatively few experimental stud-\nies showing pattern formation during CO oxidation on\nPt\u0005100\u0006, in contrast with the case of a Pt\u0005110\u0006 surface, where\nrotating spirals and pulsating target patterns, the two-\ndimensional equivalents of traveling waves, are commonly\nobserved. This difference in behavior is attributed to the dif-\nference in kinetics of the phase transitions and the fact that\nfor Pt\u0005100\u0006, the adsorption probability of oxygen on the hex\nphase is about 100 times less than that on the 1\u00011 phase,\nwhile for Pt\u0005110\u0006, the difference is only about a factor of 2.19\nWhere two-dimensional patterns have been observed on\nPt\u0005100\u0006, they are usually much more irregular than the spi-\nrals and targets typical of oscillatory systems in general.\nContinuously varying spatial pattern formation has been\nseen on Pt\u0005100\u0006 at temperatures of 480\u2013500 K and partial\npressures pO2 in the range of \u00015\u20139\u0002\u000110\n\u22125 mbar and pCO in\nthe range of \u00015\u20138\u0002\u000110\u22126 mbar using LEED.2 The surface\nwas covered in irregular patches of adsorbed oxygen and CO\nwhose arrangement changed in time through wave propaga-\ntion. Typically, a CO island of a few microns across would\nbe nucleated and then expand with constant velocity into the\noxygen-covered surface. The CO island would then rapidly\nchange to a high-oxygen state, which would finally shrink, in\nturn, as neighboring CO patches invaded. Oxygen waves\nwere also seen. The CO and oxygen wave fronts moved with\nspeeds in the range of \u00010.5\u20133\u0002 mm min\u22121 \u00018.3\u201350 \nm s\u22121\u0002.\nSubsequent photoemission electron microscopy \u0001PEEM\u0002\nexperiments also imaged dynamic spatiotemporal pattern for-\nmation during CO oxidation on Pt\u0005100\u0006. The first investiga-\ntion of this type in the parameter regime for sustained\noscillations3 \u0001380\u2013530 K and pCO and pO2 up to several\ntimes 10\u22124 mbar\u0002 found rapidly changing patterns where ar-\neas of high-oxygen coverage formed spontaneously at ran-\ndom locations and propagated in irregular waves across the\nsurface, finally diminishing after about 40 s. The velocity of\nthe oxygen fronts was measured at \n100 \nm s\u22121 at a surface\ntemperature of 480 K and partial pressures pO2 =2.85\n\u000110\u22124 mbar and pCO=2.0\u000110\u22125 mbar. Less frequently ob-\nserved but nevertheless present were slower moving and\nfairly isotropic trigger waves of oxygen islands originating\nfrom a few nucleation centers and growing in roughly circu-\nlar patterns on a time scale of several minutes. The oscilla-\ntions associated with these circular patterns were of large\namplitude and fairly regular periodicity.\nPEEM studies by Lauterbach and Rotermund4 \u0001also re-\ncently reviewed and summarized in Ref. 19\u0002 at temperatures\nbetween 420 and 540 K, with fixed pO2 =4\u000110\n\u22124 mbar and\nvariable CO partial pressure of a few times 10\u22125 mbar, found\nboth CO and oxygen fronts. At T=475 K and pCO=1.8\n\u000110\u22125 mbar, for example, a CO island nucleated on an\noxygen-covered surface and spread in a fairly isotropic man-\nner, before itself being consumed by a faster-moving oxygen\nfront coming in from behind. In contrast, at T=475 K and\npCO=3.6\u000110\u22125 mbar, many smaller irregular patches could\nbe seen. Oxygen fronts advanced into CO-covered areas, fol-\nlowed immediately by new CO fronts. The speeds of oxygen\nfronts lie in the range of 50\u2013240 \nm s\u22121, while CO fronts\nwere much slower at 2\u201326 \nm s\u22121. The difference was\nattributed19 to the fact that the coverage at the reaction inter-\nface of CO fronts was low enough to initiate the 1\u00011 to hex\nphase transition, while for oxygen fronts, this was not the\ncase.\nComparing our simulations with these experimental\nfindings, the CO fronts in our model correspond closely to\nthose observed in the early LEED study2 and in the PEEM\nexperiments of Lauterbach and Rotermund.4 The experimen-\ntal wave speeds are an order of magnitude greater than we\nfound for our model, but in both cases, one or both of the\nreactant partial pressures were higher than those for which\nwe found simple CO fronts. In agreement with Refs. 4 and\n19, we find that the slow speed of propagation corresponds to\nthe surface undergoing phase change at the front. Lauterbach\nand Rotermund4 suggest that the 1\u00011 coverage dips at the\nleading edge of the front and recovers behind it. This is\nsimilar to what we see at higher pCO, while for low values,\nthe surface remains in the hex phase behind the front.\nThe combined oxygen-CO fronts we see somewhat re-\nsemble the patterns seen by Lauterbach and Rotermund,4 cre-\nated by consecutive waves of oxygen and CO, though the\nexperimental pressures are an order of magnitude higher than\nwe used in our calculations, so the results are not directly\ncomparable. The temperature and partial pressures we chose\nare closest to those of the early LEED experiments,2 where\nboth oxygen and CO waves were observed, though at low\nresolution and so with less detail than in the later studies.\nOur simulated reaction waves travel at speeds that are in\nbroad agreement with those seen in the experiments of Lau-\nterbach and Rotermund, and in keeping with the argument\nof Lele and Lauterbach19 for faster oxygen than CO\nfronts, we find that the phase change is more gradual and of\nlower amplitude for oxygen-CO fronts compared with the\nslower-moving simple CO fronts \u0001see the 1D results in\nFigs. 8 and 10\u0002.\n164711-13 Pattern formation during the catalytic oxidation of CO on Pt\u0003100\u0004 J.

It splits the\n\u0001pO2 and pCO\u0002 parameter space, according to the type of pat-\ntern observed, into regions of very similar shape to those\nmapped out experimentally. Given the complexity of the de-\ntailed reaction dynamics included in the model, we were\npleased by the closeness of the match. It certainly suggests\nthat our mesoscopic modeling approach, where spatial infor-\nmation is determined on a scale intermediate between the\nmicroscopic spacing of the platinum atoms and the macro-\nscopic length scale of pattern formation, captures the charac-\nter of these surface patterns accurately. Compared with mi-\ncroscopic \u0001lattice gas\u0002 simulations, our method is faster and\nrequires less computational effort over larger areas of surface\nand so is efficient for the investigation of patterns that typi-\ncally occur at scales much longer than the adsorption site\nspacing.\nThe experimental region exhibiting self-sustaining oscil-\nlations is slightly shifted toward higher pO2 and pCO partial\npressures compared with the results of our model. The move\nto lower pO2 in our simulations can be explained by the fact\nthat we use the slightly higher oxygen sticking probability\nfor freed \u0001as opposed to free\u0002 sites over the whole 1\u00011\nphase and by the difficulty of determining cutoffs to distin-\nguish between stationary and oscillatory behaviors. The shift\nto a lower pCO might be explained by the fact that pCO was\nincreased stepwise in the experiments and then was iterated\nabout its final value, giving a lower average value over the\ncourse of the pattern evolution compared to our simulations\nwhere the target pCO was fixed from the beginning. If the\nexperimental region had been plotted using this lower aver-\nage value of pCO, it would be shifted toward lower values of\npCO and so might lie closer to the oscillatory region deter-\nmined from the simulations.\nThe passing of successive waves of adsorbed oxygen\nand carbon monoxide is characteristic of the continuously\nvarying spatial pattern formation seen in the experiment.2\u20134\nOur simulations reproduce this aspect of the reaction well:\nwe see two types of traveling wave \u0001CO and oxygen-CO\u0002\nthat correspond reasonably closely in terms of speed and\nextent of phase change to experimentally observed CO and\noxygen fronts. The mesoscopic approach that we have found\nsuccessful here in modeling the oxidation of CO on Pt\u0005100\u0006\ncan be adapted to other surface reactions where there is spa-\ntial organization on scales that are long compared with the\nspacing between surface atoms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust.\n1 M.
