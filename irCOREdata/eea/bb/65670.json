Stroke is an emerging problem in sub-Saharan Africa, about which\nlittle is known since most research to date has been based on retrospective,\nhospital-based studies. This anthropological work, designed to complement a\nlarge community-based project on stroke incidence, focuses on local under-\nstandings and treatment-seeking behaviours in urban (Dar-es-Salaam) and\nrural (Hai) areas of Tanzania. Semi-structured interviews (n=80) were\nconducted with 20 stroke patients, 20 relatives of stroke patients, ten\ntraditional healers, and 30 other local residents. In contrast to common\nexpectations, and literature that finds witchcraft beliefs to be most common\nin rural areas, stroke in urban Dar was widely believed to emanate from\nsupernatural causes (demons and witchcraft), while in rural Hai, explanations\ndrew mostly on \u2018natural\u2019 causes (hypertension, fatty foods, stress). These\ndifferent beliefs and explanatory models fed into treatment-seeking behav-\niours. The first option in Hai was hospital treatment, while in Dar-es-Salaam,\nwhere belief in demons led to hospital avoidance, it was traditional healers.\nIn both sites, multiple treatment options (serially or simultaneously) were the\nnorm. Analysis of patient and carer narratives suggested that causation\nbeliefs outweighed other factors, such as cost and distance, in shaping\neffective treatment. Three policy implications are drawn. First, as other\nstudies have also shown, it is important to engage with, rather than dismiss,\nlocal explanations and interpretations of stroke. Stroke awareness messages\nneed to take into account the geographical and belief systems differences.\nDeveloping an understanding of explanatory models that recognizes that\nlocal beliefs arise from dynamic processes of social interaction will be critical\nto designing effective interventions. Second, there is a clear role for multiple\nhealing systems with possibility of cross-reference in the case of a chronic,\ndisabling condition like stroke, since biomedical treatment cannot offer a\n\u2018quick fix\u2019 while traditional healers can help people come to terms with their\n35\ncondition. Third, issues of communication between health services and their\npatients are particularly critical.\nIntroduction and theoretical framework\nCerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death worldwide (Murray &\nLopez, 1997), with stroke accounting for 9\u00b76% of deaths globally (WHO, 2002).\nStroke is currently the dominant type of cardiovascular disease in China, South-east\nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While cardiovascular diseases are not generally\nconsidered a major public health problem in developing countries (Reedy, 2004),\navailable evidence suggests that stroke is an emerging problem in SSA (Walker et al.,\n2000; SASPI Project Team, 2004a, b; Connor et al., 2007). To date, however, no\npopulation-based stroke incidence studies have been published and little is known of\nmortality and morbidity outcomes of stroke in SSA (Walker et al., 2000; Connor\net al., 2007). The majority of existing stroke studies are subject to a number of\nlimitations: most are retrospective and based on hospital records, often, for example,\nsimply reporting in-hospital mortality (Connor et al., 2007).\nLocal beliefs and understandings surrounding stroke in SSA are poorly under-\nstood. A thorough literature search yielded only two published studies on this subject\nin SSA. Hundt et al. (2004) investigated lay conceptualizations of stroke-like\nsymptoms and impact on health-seeking behaviour, as part of a prevalence study in\na rural population (w60,000) of South Africa. They reported that stroke-like\nsymptoms were considered both a physical and a social condition. Plural healing\nusing clinical and social means (visiting doctors, healers, prophets and churches) was\ncommon. As this was a cross-sectional study, information on treatment seeking at the\ntime of stroke affliction relied on recall from some years previously, and the sample\nmight under-represent those with severe strokes who did not survive in the longer\nterm. Bham & Ross (2005) appraised cultural beliefs and practices of South African\nIndian Muslims, concluding that faith and religion featured strongly with regards\nto stroke aetiology; both traditional and Western medicine were used for treating\nstroke, though Western health care treatment was regarded as culturally inappropri-\nate. They interviewed both care-givers and traditional healers, but not stroke patients\nthemselves.\nMedical pluralism based on multiple illness theories and religious ideologies is a\ncommon feature of treatment seeking in SSA. For example Beckerleg (1994) found\nthat the Swahili of Coastal Kenya employ several treatment options such as hospital,\nself- and healer-administered traditional medicine and religious-based healing.\nMedical pluralism results from beliefs that illness is a product of both natural and\nsupernatural causes, and a desperate search for a cure. For example, among the Luo\nin Kenya, malaria and dysentery are held to arise from natural or environmental\ncauses, and may be treated using modern medical treatment, while other illnesses are\nbelieved to emanate from witchcraft or from breaching particular taboos and are\nthereby not amenable to treatment from Western medicine (Sindiga, 1995). Similar\nfindings have been reported for a large number of other African populations\n(Nyamwaya, 1981; Ingstad, 1990; Beckerleg, 1994; Castle, 1994; Mabilia, 2000;\nKusimba et al., 2003; Mshana et al., 2006). The attribution of illness to both natural\n36 G. Mshana et al.\nand supernatural causes has led to differing opinions as to whether African illness\naetiologies and treatments are primarily characterized by \u2018supernatural\u2019 explanations,\ne.g. witchcraft and spirits, or \u2018natural\u2019 explanations, such as theories of contagion\n(Green, 1999).\nResearch on access to health care in SSA often uses an economic framework,\nexamining the accessibility of health services by local people, the great majority of\nwhom are very poor. In Tanzania, structural adjustment programmes (SAPs)\nintroduced in the mid-80s saw the introduction of user fees in public health services.\nThis led to a widespread concern that health services would be inaccessible to people\nwho could not afford to pay (Narayan, 1997). In Tanzania, studies report that access\nto health care is also strongly influenced by cultural knowledge and interpretation\nof disease symptoms (Comoro et al., 2003; Kamat, 2006), structural and gender\nconstraints (Green, 2000; Kamat, 2006) and trust in providers (Tibandebage &\nMackintosh, 2005).\nThe present study explores beliefs regarding the causes of stroke and their impact\non treatment-seeking behaviours in rural and urban settings within Tanzania. Its\ntheoretical framework focuses on explanatory models whereby causation beliefs are\nheld to influence how people make sense of, and respond to, an illness. Explanatory\nmodels are sets of beliefs that \u2018contain any or all aspects of five issues: aetiology;\nonset of symptoms; pathophysiology; course of sickness (severity and type of sick\nrole); and treatment\u2019 (Kleinman, 1980). Held by individuals, they simultaneously\ncreate order and meaning, help purposive action, and produce the conditions required\nfor their own perpetuation or revision (Kleinman, 1980). Explanatory models are\ndiverse even within the same community and are likely to alter over time in response\nto particular medical experiences (Kleinman, 1980, pp. 106\u2013111). Therefore, an illness\nor disease experience may be interpreted within a range of cultural or religious\nframeworks leading to different courses of remedy seeking for individuals or\ncommunities. For example, in predominantly Islamic communities, reproductive\nhealth is largely framed within a range of understandings of Islamic dictates;\nunderstandings which vary from community to community (Inhorn & Sargent, 2006).\nA wide range of studies and analyses on illnesses such as diabetes (Poss & Jezewski,\n2002), AIDS (Baer et al., 2004) and cancer (Dein, 2004) have been framed within the\nexplanatory models framework.\nDrawing on anthropological theory and methods, this present study appraises how\nindividuals draw upon a range of resources (culture, religion, education, extended\nfamily, social networks, exposure to public health messages, and perceived treatment\nefficacy) when attempting to make sense of stroke, its causation and burden. The\nresearch was designed to complement an epidemiological study: the Tanzania Stroke\nIncidence Project (TSIP) \u2013 a three-year prospective study assessing stroke incidence,\nrisk factors and outcomes in the Dar-es-Salaam and Hai study populations of the\nAdult Morbidity and Mortality Project (AMMP) (Walker et al., 2000). Case detection\nproceeds when one of the local TSIP enumerators reports that someone is suspected\nof having suffered a stroke. A field supervisor then arranges for transport and\nadmission to hospital, while the research physician coordinates investigations (electro-\ncardiogram (ECG), computerised tomography (CT) head scan, blood tests) and\nfollow-up after discharge. The project meets the costs of transport, hospital stay, tests\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 37\nand treatment, along with one year of secondary prevention treatment of stroke such\nas hypertension treatment. Despite these incentives to minimize both an \u2018economic\nbarrier\u2019 and a \u2018distance barrier\u2019, people in Dar-es-Salaam were reluctant participants\nin this project. Feedback from a workshop conducted with TSIP stakeholders\n(community members, traditional healers, health workers, project staff) suggested that\nstroke patients in Dar-es-Salaam were reluctant to be admitted to hospital, due to a\nwidespread belief that stroke is caused by witchcraft. The anthropological study was\ncommissioned to further explore these issues.\nStudy sites\nFieldwork for this anthropological study was conducted for one month at each site\n(Dar, September 2004; Hai, March 2005).\nDar-es-Salaam is the commercial capital of Tanzania, located on the Indian Ocean\ncoast. Main economic activities are commerce, including all forms of trading, both\nlarge- and small-scale, formal employment in the government or private sectors, and\nfishing. In Ilala and Temeke districts where this study was conducted, the population\nis of mixed ethnicity, originating from other parts of Tanzania despite being originally\noccupied by the Zaramo ethnic group. Seventy per cent of residents in the\nDar-es-Salaam AMMP project area are Muslims while Christians make up the\nremaining 30% (Indepth Network, 2002).\nHai district is located in Kilimanjaro region, north-east Tanzania. It spans the\nslopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the dry plains on the leeward side of the mountain.\nIts main highway goes from Arusha town (tourist centre and headquarters of the East\nAfrican Community) to Moshi town and Dar-es-Salaam. The main ethnic group is\nChagga, though there are also small pockets of Pare and Maasai. In the Hai AMMP\nsite, the majority are Christians (79%) while the remaining 21% are Muslims (Indepth\nNetwork, 2002). The main economic activities are small-scale and subsistence farming\n(bananas, maize, beans, coffee) and medium-scale flower farming for export. Cattle-\nkeeping is also common, especially among the Maasai. Though considered rural, Hai\nhas a well developed education and medical infrastructure relative to other rural\nareas: the district has many primary and secondary schools and hospitals (e.g.\nMachame hospital, a large private institution established by the Lutheran church over\n100 years ago). There are also many retired teachers, civil servants and company\nemployees who returned to their villages at the end of their paid working lives.\nWhile the inclusion of these two sites might provide an opportunity to examine\nrural\/urban differences related to stroke perception and treatment, there are clearly\nconfounding factors operating: social, historical and cultural differences. In particular,\nthe religious beliefs and practices framing experiences of health, illness and well-being\nmean that a straightforward rural\/urban comparison is not possible.\nMethods\nThe qualitative research design relied primarily on in-depth interviews using a\nsemi-structured guide on topics such as respondents\u2019 educational background, beliefs\n38 G. Mshana et al.\nabout causes of ill health in general and stroke in particular, and stroke-related\ntreatment-seeking behaviours. Semi-structured interviews allow maximum flexibility of\ncoverage and capture the richness of the themes articulated by respondents (Drever,\n1995).\nA combination of sampling methods was used, both purposive and random, to\ncapture variation in respondents\u2019 characteristics along the following dimensions: study\nsite (40 from Dar, 40 from Hai); gender (40 men and 40 women); and experience of\nstroke (20 patients, 20 relatives, 10 traditional healers, 30 other local residents). The\npatients were identified from data gathered by TSIP physicians and field enumerators\n\u2013 they were selected after consideration of their physical state, since stroke-related\nspeech impairment and brain damage could make a meaningful interview difficult.\nRelatives were selected from patients\u2019 households, having asked who had been closely\ninvolved in managing the illness and made observations confirming such reports.\nHealers were randomly selected from a list of 30 traditional healers provided by the\nTSIP community enumerators. Other lay people, who were not part of TSIP, were\nrandomly selected from village or mtaa registration lists (mtaa is the Swahili word for\nstreet).\nThe sampling procedure is subject to certain limitations. Stroke patients were\nrecruited from a pool of individuals about whom TSIP staff had become aware\nthrough the reporting network. As a result, those who sought only traditional\ntreatments, or no treatment, for stroke were more likely to have been missed than\nthose seeking treatment at hospital (all health facilities to which stroke patients might\nbe admitted are checked on a regular basis). The risk of under-estimation is relatively\nsmall, however, since TSIP enumerators are local people, based in villages, likely to\npick up most cases of people with stroke-like symptoms, even if they have not sought\nformal treatment.\nInterviews were conducted at suitable locations, mostly at the respondents\u2019 home,\nfor the convenience of participants and to ensure confidentiality. They were preceded\nby rapport building through general conversation (for example, about weather and\nsports) and conducted in Swahili by same-sex interviewers, taking between 1Y and\n2 hours and tape-recorded. Ethical approval was obtained from the Tanzanian\nMedical Research Coordination Committee and informed consent (signed or thumb\nprinted) was obtained from all respondents before commencing interviews.\nMultistage data analysis was employed. Data transcripts (of Swahili interviews\ninto English) were reviewed and summarized in chart form. Emerging themes were\nthen identified, using the principle of grounded theory whereby theoretical under-\nstanding emanates from data (Glasser & Strauss, 1967). Data were examined again in\nlight of hypotheses emerging in this first stage of analysis. Validation was sought by\nshifting between emic and etic perspectives (Miles & Huberman, 1994); where cases\nwere discrepant with ongoing hypotheses, they served to re-appraise explanatory\nmodels (Bernard, 1995).\nResults\nThis section begins by presenting socio-demographic characteristics of the respond-\nents, a typology of healers interviewed and an overview of local terms used for stroke,\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 39\nbefore discussing in-depth findings on causal explanations of stroke in the two field\nsites and how these relate to treatment-seeking behaviour and decision-making (see\nFig. 1).\nSocio-demographic characteristics (see Table 1)\nThe majority of respondents (70%) had just primary school education. Smaller\nnumbers had secondary school education (20%) or no formal schooling at all (10%).\nExcluding the traditional healers, the majority of respondents (80%) were housewives,\ncasual labourers, farmers, retirees or self-employed in small businesses such as selling\nfood and hair salons. The remaining 20% were employees (such as teachers and\nsoldiers) and students.\nTypology of healers\nThe term \u2018traditional healer\u2019 is used here to refer to the four categories of healers\ninterviewed. One healer self-identified as a herbalist and reported only using\ntreatments made from plant roots and leaves. Two healers said they treated through\npossession of spirits known as maruhani. When a patient goes to them, they invoke\nthe spirits and are then able to ascertain the cause and appropriate mode of\ntreatment. They said it is the maruhani who treat people through them because if not\npossessed, they are not able to treat. A 54-year-old female healer in Dar said:\nThey [maruhani] come in my head . the maruhani come into my head, they treat in their way\n. they tell you . make you dream that this ill person will be treated using so and so medicine,\n[the maruhani tell you] go to the shop and ask for so and so medicine . the shops selling Arabic\nmedicine.\nA third group of five healers use a form of divination known in Swahili as kupiga\nbao or ramli to tell the cause of an illness and thereafter treat their patients using\nmedicine from plant and animal products. The fourth group, consisting of two\nhealers, treat their patients using verses from the Koran in combination with plant\nand animal products. Respondents referred to traditional healers as mganga [sing.]\nwaganga [pl.] (healers or doctors), mganga\/waganga wa kienyeji (local healers\/doctors)\nand fundi or mtaalam (expert). Respondents did not make a clear distinction between\nthe different types of healers.\nTerms used for stroke\nThe Swahili word for stroke \u2013 kiharusi \u2013 is generally recognized by the lay\npopulation. This specific noun has no other meaning in Swahili. It was the main term\nfor stroke in Dar-es-Salaam, though in Hai, stroke is more commonly referred to as\nparalaizi (paralysis) or presha (pressure), due to people associating stroke with partial\nbody paralysis and hypertension. Partly due to TSIP, patients and relatives were\nfamiliar with stroke as a condition and could talk of specific symptoms and outcomes\nsuch as sudden loss of conscious, body weakness and partial paralysis. The experience\nof going to hospital through TSIP and interaction with doctors and other health\nworkers may have contributed to raising stroke awareness among patients and their\n40 G.

In Dar-es-Salaam, stroke was widely understood to be caused by\n\u2018demons\u2019, in complete contrast to rural Hai (demons were mentioned by 26 Dar and\nfour Hai respondents).\nRespondents in Dar-es-salaam used Swahili terms such as upepo mbaya (literarily\nmeaning bad wind), mdudu (insect) and mnyama (animal) when referring to the\ndemons causing stroke. A 65-year-old man explained:\nStroke cause is similar to convulsions . we say it is mdudu (insect) ... we say it is an animal .\nmeaning it is a bad devil (shetani mbaya) or in other formal language it is a demon . when it\nattacks you, it either stays in all your body parts, legs and arms or in one part of your body.\nSome respondents referred to the demons as shetani (devil, evil spirit) and jini\n(derived from Arabic word for demon \u2018jinn\u2019).\nSuch demons intentionally attack a person, in association with witchcraft, or strike\naccidentally. For example, a 42-year-old female patient reported:\nThe demon just comes . it just attacks you. It attacked me [at night] and when I woke up next\nmorning my arm and leg were heavy . I felt numb . you can see my eye . this whole part\nbecame numb.\nTable 1.

Mshana et al.\nThis causal explanation seems to be reinforced, or even imposed, by all groups of\ntraditional healers who all associated cause of stroke with human agency through\nsending the demons to attack others. One healer said:\nYou say stroke, paralysis illness . if you go with our expertise we traditional people will tell you\nthat stroke is caused by a sent demon . that is the way we understand it.\nIn these cases, people should first seek treatment for removing the demon.\nThere is a common belief in Dar-es-Salaam that stroke attacks happen in toilets\nand on pathways. This was not substantiated in interviews with the ten patients in\nDar. There was only one attack in the toilet \u2013 two while sleeping in bed at night, five\nwhile sitting at home, one in a commuter bus, and one during a meeting. For Hai,\nno such belief was reported and, of the ten stroke patients interviewed, three had\nattacks while sitting at home, one while washing dishes, one while taking a bath, one\nwhile coming back from the toilet, one in a bus on his way to work, one in a\nclassroom while teaching, one while walking on the road, and one while farming.\nSome respondents reported that the belief that most strokes happen in toilets\nresonates with local interpretations of Islamic teaching, which incorporates aspects of\ntraditional magico-religious beliefs with demons assigned specific locations. People are\ntaught to utter a special prayer when entering and leaving toilets in order to avoid\nbeing attacked by such demons.\nIn cases of stroke attacks inside or nearby toilets, it was said that sufferers should\nbe smeared with faeces and urine. One woman reported that, when she had her\nstroke, she urinated on her clothes and her neighbour made her drink urine and\nsmeared her with faeces: since demons that cause stroke don\u2019t like dirt, they would\nrelease someone smeared by faeces from the toilet.\n(b) Witchcraft. Many Dar-es-Salaam respondents thought that stroke was caused\nby witchcraft (kulogwa). Witchcraft allegations involving stroke were mainly associ-\nated with conflict and jealousy within the community \u2013 conflict for land (between\nneighbours) or jealousy related to social advancement (e.g. taking children to school).\nAn 80-year-old female stroke patient said:\nI do business and was getting some good money. I decided to demolish the mud houses and build\ncement block ones . I thought they would help my children when I die . they will get\nsomewhere to stay . the decision let me down . Eeh ... they suddenly gave me stroke . I was\njust sitting and saw an animal coming to me . and it attacked me.\nIn rural Hai, the mention of witchcraft was uncommon. Only a few respondents,\nmostly traditional healers, believed stroke was caused by witchcraft; in villages at\nlarge few people were thought to believe this. This is probably partly due to the\ndominance of Christianity in the area, and a long historical missionary presence, with\nmany schools and hospitals built by the Lutheran and Catholic churches. One\n75-year-old male respondent illustrated this by saying:\nThere are people who believe [that stroke is caused by witchcraft] ... but very few Christians ...\nIt\u2019s just these days that it is coming up among Christians ... eeh these days it is coming up ... and\nit is caused by people who have interacted with other people. You know in the past those things\nwere not here ... but interaction, people go out ... For example my father never knew about\nwitchcraft ... or feeling jealousy for anybody.\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 43\nIn both Dar-es-Salaam and Hai, traditional healers perpetuate beliefs that stroke\nis caused by witchcraft and related demons, with appraisal of causes through\ndivination and possession. All study respondents who reported visiting a traditional\nhealer were told this. Even where traditional healers recognize a \u2018natural\u2019 affliction,\nthe explanation offered is that witchcraft precipitated its actual manifestations (cf.\nEvans Pritchard\u2019s writings on witchcraft among the Azande, re-published 1976). For\nexample, one traditional healer [using Koranic verses] agreed that his patient was\nsuffering from stroke, but said this had been \u2018caused\u2019 by stepping over a charm placed\nacross the road by jealous people who wanted to harm her.\n(c) \u2018Pressure\u2019 (hypertension). In Hai, stroke was widely understood to be caused\nby high blood pressure (hypertension), a view which arose largely through interactions\nwith health practitioners (doctors, nurses and village health workers) who told\npatients that stroke was caused by hypertension and should be controlled by\nmedication and dietary salt reduction. In Dar-es-Salaam, by contrast, only a handful\nof respondents reported that high blood pressure causes stroke \u2013 a consequence of\nreduced contact with health professionals or to dominance of other belief systems.\n(d) Stress. Many more respondents mentioned stress in Hai, compared with\nDar-es-Salaam (24 vs 8). They said life had become difficult and people tended to\nthink and worry a lot, about many things such as how they would feed their families\nor pay their children\u2019s school fees. A typical statement was made by a 72-year-old\nmale stroke patient in Hai:\nFor example, in my case, right from the beginning I was getting very upset very often. You are\nanxious about what your children will do, for example school children, fees . you only have two\nthousand and six hundred [shillings]. Like me, I have four children and they each need two\nthousand six hundred shillings. I only have two tins of beans. I was thinking and had no help\nI started being stressed . just stressed.\n(e) Fatty foods. Another common belief in Hai \u2013 less common in Dar \u2013 is that\nstroke results from eating food cooked with a lot of oil or containing a lot of fat. In\nparticular, usage of the cooking oil available in local shops, marketed to emulate\nmodern lifestyles, was associated with increased incidence of stroke. A 75-year-old\nDar man stated:\nThis illness is caused by these reasons . either eating certain things . this cooking oil which\nhas been brought to the shops is bad . it is not good . I do not take it . very bad . I have\nforbidden them [his family members] to buy it . I just buy coconuts [for cooking].\n(f) Other causes. In both sites, stroke was also said to be the expression of \u2018God\u2019s\nwill\u2019. A few Hai respondents mentioned that stroke resulted from angry ancestral\nspirits. Only one Dar respondent reported that stroke could be inherited, though\nseveral respondents knew that other relatives had also suffered a stroke attack.\nTreatment-seeking behaviours\nFacilities within study sites and costs. There are 75 health facilities in Hai (of which\n26 are public) and 113 health facilities in Temeke (of which 23 are public). Public\n44 G. Mshana et al.\nhealth facilities are preferred by the majority of residents as they are perceived to be\ncheap. The consultation fee at public health facilities is 1000 shillings (1US$ is\nequivalent to 1200 Tanzanian shillings). A national health insurance programme is\noperational in Tanzania whereby a family pays 10,000 shillings annually for\nconsultation and drug costs. Few families are enrolled in this programme as they\ncannot afford to pay the money upfront in lump sum. In addition, respondents talked\nof erratic drug supply at public facilities resulting in them buying medicines instead\nfrom local shops. Health facilities in both sites are accessible throughout the year via\na modest road network though respondents complained of high costs for hiring a\nvehicle to transport a patient to hospital. This may range between 2000 shillings in\nurban Dar up to 50,000 shillings in remote rural Hai. There is no huge cost difference\nbetween traditional healers and hospital services. Consulting a healer may cost\nbetween 2000 and 20,000 shillings depending on the type and duration of treatment.\nTraditional healers are generally perceived as cheaper since they usually allow\npayment in instalments or after treatment. Faith healers do not charge for the healing\nservices though healed people may give a small amount of money as a thanks-giving\noffering.\nTreatment patterns (see Fig. 1). In Dar-es-Salaam, the first resort for stroke is\ntraditional medicine (six out of ten interviewed patients) administered by traditional\nhealers. Medicines are taken orally, inhaled or massaged on the paralysed body parts,\nat the healer\u2019s or sufferer\u2019s home. Hospital treatment is the second most common\ntreatment option (two out of ten interviewed patients). Combined traditional and\n\u2018modern\u2019 options are also evident. A 70-year-old male patient in Dar illustrated how\ntraditional medicine is preferred in the first instance by saying:\n. [after the stroke] I was taken home . then they looked for an expert [healer] . he came and\nstarted applying his medicine until I regained consciousness . after I regained consciousness I\nwas taken to my second house . and another healer was brought and he treated me . I started\nwalking, sit up slowly . then Juma came [TSIP enumerator] looking for stroke patients . the\nfirst day he came in the morning . they came three of them . and told me we have come to\ntake you to hospital . I refused, I totally refused, and they left . the second time they came\nand left . the third time they found me seated inside . and I told them come for me . I agreed\nas I had finished traditional matters . they said they will come on Monday . they came the\nnext Monday and took me to hospital.\nIn Hai, the majority of stroke patients seek hospital treatment (seven out of ten\ninterviewed patients): typically, this involves a nearby local clinic, but if the condition\ndoes not improve, a larger district or mission hospital.\nFaith-based healing is another common option for stroke treatment in Hai and,\nto a lesser extent, in Dar-es-Salaam (two interviewed patients in Hai, none in Dar).\nFaith-based healing is mostly offered through Christian churches, though in Dar-es-\nSalaam, a Muslim faith healer did pray for stroke patients; people (with any illness)\nwere taken to his home and prayed for, free of charge. The line between \u2018traditional\u2019\nand \u2018faith-based\u2019 healing in Dar may be blurred, since Koranic verses are sometimes\nused to exorcise demons.\nA stroke patient may be prayed for immediately after suffering a stroke, or after\nreturning home from a hospital. The prayers are made by church members, during the\nillness episode or recovery, to seek a cure. Respondents stated, for example, that\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 45\nprayers made the hospital drugs effective: as one Hai respondent said, \u2018God works\nthrough the pills by making them effective.\u2019\nIn both sites, a combination of treatments was common, serially or simul-\ntaneously, inspired by a deep desire to get better by any means possible, and a need\nfor hope in the efficacy of at least one of a range of options. Religious orientation per\nse did not appear to determine the treatment option sought. Some Christian\nrespondents consulted traditional healers and offered sacrifices to ancestors as in the\nfollowing example of a 44-year-old Hai stroke patient. She said:\nYou know I then had a stroke ... my mouth went to one side and I went to the clinic ... at the\nclinic they told me that this is a strange illness therefore you must go to a bigger hospital ... I\nleft and went to Kibosho [hospital]. I was treated at Kibosho until a [TSIP] doctor came and took\nme to KCMC. I stayed at KCMC and they took tests and they said that they did not see anything\nwrong in their tests ... I went back home and my condition became worse ... then I asked for\nmoney [from relatives] and went to buy a goat for offering sacrifice to ancestral spirits ... the goat\nwas slaughtered and I continued getting relief ... then I went to a traditional healer at Kibosho\nwho gave me medicine which I used ... then I got relief up to now.\nThere were mixed feeling from the patients who received treatment from\ntraditional healers. Some expressed relief after treatment while others said they did\nnot feel any better. For those who expressed relief, traditional medicine might have\nhad a psychological effect of making them feel better. It may also be due to the\nnatural course of the illness. A 59-year-old male patient in Dar reported:\nWhen I had it [stroke] I did not have the strength to sit up . I only used traditional medicine\n. one man [healer] was called to come and treat me using traditional medicine . he lives nearby\n. all my relatives came to help me . I was not conscious at that time . therefore he helped\nme using traditional medicine . I got relief from that situation . he gave me oral medicine until\nI regained consciousness . I was able to tell who is who.\nReasons for choice of treatment course\nIn Dar, the fear of injections at hospital appears to be a major factor deterring\nstroke patients from accessing the formal health system. It is commonly thought that\na stroke patient may die following an injection, because demons feeding on blood\ngain entrance to the victim\u2019s body. There is not complete consensus on this issue\namong traditional healers in Dar (four of whom took this view, while one disagreed),\nyet patients commonly associated hospitals with injections and specified that hospital\ntreatment should wait until a traditional healer had made demons leave.\nConversely, Hai people typically sought hospital treatment in line with their beliefs\nin \u2018natural\u2019 causation, pursuing other treatment options when outcome was not\nsatisfactory. This decision is influenced by what patients and relatives hear from the\ndoctors. Several patients who had been discharged from hospital following a range of\ntests (blood tests, chest X-ray and a CT scan) reported that doctors had told them\nthere were \u2018no problems with their tests\u2019. They interpreted this to mean that doctors\ncould not see what was wrong with them, and as they continued feeling ill, they then\npursued other available options for healing. A 44-year-old female respondent in Hai\ntalked of such an experience:\nI went to KCMC [Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre], when I reached there I was admitted\nfor that night ... the next day I was taken for X-ray ... I was taken for a head X-ray and chest\n46 G. Mshana et al.\nX-ray ... They also took other tests such as [blood] pressure and the other test for the whole body\n... then after giving out blood they told me that they do not see any problem with my tests.\nLater in the interview she continued by saying:\n. at KCMC I was not given any drugs . when I came back I went back again to a traditional\nhealer . Eee, because I said to myself if the doctor has taken tests and saw that there is nothing.\nIn some cases, where prayers over the long-term had brought no relief, patients\nresorted to switching church in search for a cure. A 48-year-old Hai respondent\ndescribed how her husband moved from one church to another in search for a cure:\nFirst of all this person [her husband] had this paralysis illness . it is a recent illness as before\nthat he had an illness of nose bleeding . he got cured from that illness . then he was losing\nconsciousness . they say it is an illness of demons . he went to Lutheran church and was\nbaptized . then he left and went to Pentecostal church . and he is still with Pentecostal up to\nnow but they have not helped him, he is not cured, but he continues to pray to his God.\nTreatment decision-making\nRelatives are heavily involved in the process of decision-making, particularly for\nthe first treatment option when a patient may be too incapacitated to take a decision\nindependently. In their interviews, all but one stroke patient reported that spouses,\nbrothers, sisters or children had been the ones deciding how and where their stroke\nepisodes should be treated. The exception was a woman living in a rented house with\nother tenants, abandoned by her relatives after she became ill, divorced from her\nhusband and without children; she and her neighbours decided she should go to\nhospital.\nDiscussion\nIn common with other stroke studies in SSA (Hundt et al., 2004; Bham & Ross,\n2005), causal explanations for stroke in Tanzania range from the \u2018natural\u2019 to the\n\u2018supernatural\u2019, with several respondents holding multiple causal beliefs simul-\ntaneously. Despite some overlap, there were substantial differences between respond-\nents interviewed in Hai and Dar-es-Salaam. In rural predominantly Christian Hai,\nexplanations were predominantly within the \u2018natural\u2019 model, with hypertension, diet\nand stress the leading causes cited. In urban predominantly Muslim Dar, stroke was\nmore widely attributed to supernatural factors, such as demons and witchcraft.\nA range of treatments were tried by stroke sufferers, with clear differences between\nsites. In Dar, traditional medicine was a first resort, and hospital treatment the second\nline; in Hai, hospital treatment was preferred on the whole. Avoidance of hospital in\nDar was linked to the belief that injections can be fatal to someone who has just had\na stroke (necessitating prior visit with a traditional healer who could \u2018remove\u2019 demons\nfrom the body). Such belief has been reported in South Africa (Hundt et al., 2004;\nSASPI Team, 2004a) and elswhere in Tanzania in a coastal region close to Dar where\nmothers, believing that certain forms of childhood malaria (degedege) were caused by\nevil spirits, had refused injections for fear they would prove fatal (Comoro et al.,\n2003).\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 47\nThe belief in demons causing illnesses is also reported among the costal Swahili\nof Kenya (Beckerleg, 1994). Local Islamic interpretations such as the residence of\nstroke-causing demons in toilets may be an example of how local Islamic interpre-\ntations are formulated to deal with new health technologies and challenges (Inhorn &\nSargent 2006). It is unsurprising to find that non-medical explanations are readily\nelicited in the case of stroke. Unlike many other conditions affecting adults, stroke is\nan affliction that characteristically occurs very suddenly, in a person with no\npreceding illness or worrying signs, with very severe sequelae, usually paralysis of one\nside of the body. More than most conditions, there may be a sense that the victim\nhas been \u2018struck\u2019 by some malevolent power.\nIt is notable that most stroke patients involved in this study employed several\ntreatment options, either serially or simultaneously. This finding is common to other\nresearch on stroke-related beliefs and treatment-seeking behaviours in South Africa,\nfor example, where plural healing systems involve traditional and Western medicine\nfor treatment of stroke-like symptoms \u2013 visiting doctors, healers, prophets and\nchurches \u2013 to deal with different aspects of their physical, mental and social well-being\n(cf. Hundt et al., 2004; Bham & Ross, 2005).\nIt is interesting, however, that beliefs in supernatural causes were more common\nin urban Dar than in the rural district of Hai; this contrasts with other reports that\nwitchcraft beliefs are more common in rural areas (Tanner, 1956; Mesaki, 1994). The\ncomparison between sites, however, is far from straightforward since there are\nimportant cultural and historical differences between the two populations. In\nparticular, the early influence of missionaries and the establishment of particular\nforms of Christianity among the Chagga have discouraged people in rural Hai from\nengaging with beliefs and practices associated with witchcraft.\nFrom this study, it is clear that health beliefs play an important role in people\u2019s\nattempts to make sense of stroke and decide on the course of treatment. Even though\nthe TSIP paid for transport, tests and treatment costs to a major referral hospital\nabout 10 km away (Muhimbili), many people in Dar-es-Salaam preferred to seek\ntraditional treatment, at least in the first instance. Clearly, health beliefs are not the\nonly factor when people make sense of an illness or when deciding on treatment\noptions, but this study demonstrates that these are very important, outweighing\ncost\/distance factors in many cases.\nInteractions with significant others, particularly healers (both health service staff\nand traditional healers), play an important role in treatment seeking. For example, the\nsecond treatment option taken by patients in Hai is influenced by their encounters\nwith medical practitioners. What doctors communicate to patients, and how patients\ninterpret what they say, alters the patient\u2019s explanatory models for stroke. In turn,\nthis influences what treatment option is taken next, especially when doctors appear\ndismissive of symptoms as \u2018normal\u2019. In particular, patients who are told that doctors\nfind \u2018no problems\u2019 with results of hospital tests may interpret this to mean that\ndoctors cannot see what is afflicting them; patients then opt for other treatment\noptions, such as visiting traditional healers.\nThe extended family and close friends are also important in influencing the type\nof treatment a stroke patient receives. The first treatment option, in particular, is\nlargely determined by relatives, due to the incapacity of the patient, while subsequent\n48 G. Mshana et al.\ndecisions may be taken with more personal involvement. It is because stroke can lead\nto sudden incapacity that families are likely to be involved in treatment decisions \u2013\nwith other adult illnesses in rural Tanzania, it has been noted that while extended\nfamilies influence decisions related to healing and access to health services, individual\nadults still made their own decisions regarding treatment option (Green, 2000). In the\ncase of stroke, the substantial involvement of relatives in decision-making leads to\ninteresting negotiations between explanatory models of different family members.\nPolicy implications\nAlthough based on a limited sample, the rich narratives provided by the participants\nin this study illustrate clearly some of the challenges inherent in stroke management\nin these parts of Tanzania, where different belief systems and forms of practice\nconfront one another. These findings highlight three important policy issues.\nFirst, as other studies have demonstrated, (e.g. Hundt et al., 2004; Bham & Ross,\n2005) it is important to engage with, rather than dismiss, local explanations and\ninterpretations related to stroke. The experience of the larger-scale TSIP, combined\nwith the qualitative findings presented here, shows that beliefs of stroke causation are\ncentral to the ways in which people respond to the condition and seek treatment.\nIndeed, removing cost and distance barriers did not result in people abandoning\ntraditional explanations and treatment options. Explanations featuring the supernatu-\nral make sense in cases where illness appears suddenly, has no obvious cause, and\ndoes not readily respond to biomedical treatment. Stroke awareness programmes need\nto take into account religious, historical and socio-cultural differences when designing\nappropriate health education messages. Developing a detailed understanding of local\nbeliefs, within a model that recognizes that beliefs are not uniform and rigid but\nconstructed through dynamic social interactions, will be critical to designing effective\nand \u2018culturally-compelling\u2019 interventions (Willms et al., 2001; Panter-Brick et al.,\n2006).\nSecond, there is a clear role for multiple healing systems to be involved in the\ntreatment of stroke. This may be achieved through establishment of cross-referral\nsystems between traditional and faith healers on one side and \u2018modern\u2019 health care\nservices on the other side. Treatment within biomedical systems focuses largely on\nrehabilitation, management of disability (e.g. physiotherapy) and prevention of\nfurther attacks (e.g. treating hypertension). For many patients, loss of function is\npermanent. In this context, traditional and faith healers can play critical roles. They\nmay help someone come to terms with what has happened to them, and make sense\nof their situation. Some respondents wanted to believe that recovery was possible, and\nused faith healing after exhausting biomedical options in order to face the future with\nhope, rather than dread.\nThird, communication between health professionals, patients and relatives is\ncritical. Two messages in particular are poorly communicated. Many people may\nabandon biomedical treatment because they do not see themselves being \u2018cured\u2019: it is\nessential to explain, from the outset, the limitations of treatment versus rehabilitation\nand prevention. Test results are also miscommunicated: where verdicts are phrased as\nPerceptions of stroke in Tanzania 49\n\u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018no problem with the tests\u2019, patients may think doctors dismiss their\ncondition as trivial or non-existent; because this conflicts with their experience of\nserious functional losses, they feel demoralized and abandon hospital treatment.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank all study participants in Dar-es-Salaam and Hai for their valuable\ntime and information.
