F. M. AL-OMARI1 and S. A. GOURLEY2\n1Faculty of Engineering Technology, PO Box 15008, Al-Balqa Applied University, Amman 11134, Jordan\n2Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, UK\ne-mail: s.gourley@surrey.ac.uk\n(Received 14 January 2004; revised 26 August 2004)\nWe propose a delay di\ufb00erential equation model for a single species with stage-structure\nin which the maturation delay is modelled as a distribution, to allow for the possibility\nthat individuals may take di\ufb00erent amounts of time to mature. General birth and death\nrate functions are used. We \ufb01nd that the dynamics of the model depends largely on the\nqualitative form of the birth function, which depends on the total number of adults. If it\nis monotonic increasing and a non-zero equilibrium exists, then the equilibrium is globally\nstable for all maturation delay distributions with compact support. For the case of a \ufb01nite\nspatial domain with impermeable boundaries, a reaction-di\ufb00usion extension of the model\nis rigorously derived using an approach based on the von Foerster di\ufb00usion equation. The\nresulting reaction-di\ufb00usion system is nonlocal. The dynamics of the reaction-di\ufb00usion system\nagain depends largely on the qualitative form of the birth function. If the latter is non-\nmonotone with a single hump, then the dynamics depends largely on whether the equilibrium\nis to the left or right of the hump, with oscillatory dynamics a possibility if it is su\ufb03ciently\nfar to the right.\n1 Introduction\nThe following system for a single species population was proposed by Aiello & Freedman\n[1]:\nu\u2032i(t)= \u03b1um(t) \u2212 \u03b3ui(t) \u2212 \u03b1 e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4um(t \u2212 \u03c4),\nu\u2032m(t)= \u03b1 e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4um(t \u2212 \u03c4) \u2212 \u03b2u2m(t),\n(1.1)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and the delay \u03c4 are positive constants. In this system, ui and um denote\nthe numbers of immature (juvenile) and mature (adult) members of the population\nrespectively, and the delay \u03c4 is the time taken from birth to maturity. System (1.1)\nprovides an alternative, and arguably more realistic, model for a single population than\nthe well known logistic equation u\u2032 = u(1 \u2212 u) by recognising that individuals cannot\nreproduce right from birth but only after they have become mature, which takes time \u03c4.\nIt is assumed that the birth rate at any time is proportional to the number of adults at\nthat time, so that the birth rate at time t is \u03b1um(t). The \ufb01rst term in the right hand side of\nthe second equation of (1.1) represents the rate of recruitment into the adult population.\n38 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nThis rate is essentially the birth rate \u03c4 time units ago, discounted by the factor e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 which\naccounts for mortality during the juvenile phase. The parameter \u03b3 measures the juvenile\ndeath rate while \u03b2 measures the adult death rate. As shown in Aiello & Freedman [1], all\nsolutions of (1.1), other than the trivial solution, converge to the equilibrium solution\n(ui, um) \u2261\n(\n\u03b12\n\u03b2\u03b3\ne\u2212\u03b3\u03c4(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4) , \u03b1\n\u03b2\ne\u2212\u03b3\u03c4\n)\n.\nAiello and Freedman assume that the maturation delay \u03c4 is known exactly and that all\nindividuals take this amount of time to mature. The aims of the present paper are threefold.\nFirst, we aim to modify (1.1) to allow for the fact that the time from birth to maturity may\nbe rather imperfectly known, or it might vary from individual to individual. Secondly,\nwe shall allow a more general birthrate function and a more general deathrate for the\nmatures. Thirdly, we shall consider how to incorporate spatial e\ufb00ects into the resulting\nsystem of equations, and we shall show that these result in a nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion\nsystem which we shall analyse using comparison principles.\nWe will still assume that the birth rate at any time is related to the number of adults\nat that time, but the birth rate in this paper will be b(um(t)) rather than \u03b1um(t), where\nb(\u00b7) is called the births function and satis\ufb01es certain assumptions. Two cases of particular\ninterest are the case when b(um) is increasing for all um > 0, and the case when b(um)\nqualitatively resembles Pume\n\u2212Aum which is particularly relevant in modelling populations\nwhich cannot reproduce if two many individuals are present. We shall leave the death\nrate for the immatures as \u03b3ui(t), but for the matures we shall replace \u03b2u\n2\nm(t) by a more\ngeneral death rate function d(um(t)) satisfying certain assumptions.\nReplacing \u03b1um(t) by b(um(t)) has the consequence that the adult recruitment term\nin (1.1) becomes e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4b(um(t\u2212 \u03c4)), but we now want to address the point about uncertainty\nin the maturation delay. We propose to replace e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4b(um(t \u2212 \u03c4)) by a distributed delay\nterm allowing for a distribution of maturation times, weighted by a probability density\nfunction (the function f appearing below). We shall assume that at time t the number\nthat become mature, per unit time, is\u222b \u221e\n0\nb(um(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds.\nThe term b(um(t\u2212 s)) is the birth rate at time t\u2212 s, assuming that the birth rate at a given\ntime is a function of the number of mature adults around at that time. The quantity f(s) ds,\nwith ds in\ufb01nitesimal, is the probability that an individual member takes an amount of time\nbetween s and s+ ds to mature, and e\u2212\u03b3s is the probability of an individual born at time\nt\u2212s still being alive at time t. Individuals becoming mature at time t could have been born\nat any time prior to this, and the integral totals up the contributions from all previous\ntimes. Therefore, in the absence of any spatial e\ufb00ects the model (1.1) is generalised to\nu\u2032i(t)= b(um(t)) \u2212 \u03b3ui(t) \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nb(um(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds,\nu\u2032m(t)=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nb(um(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(um(t)),\n(1.2)\nwhere\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nf(s) ds=1 and f\u0001 0, because f is a probability density function. System (1.1)\nis a particular case of system (1.2). It arises when we take f(s)= \u03b4(s \u2212 \u03c4), where \u03b4 is the\nDirac delta function, b(um)= \u03b1um and d(um)= \u03b2u\n2\nm.\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 39\n2 Positivity\nWe will prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 In system (1.2), assume that b(0)= 0 and b(um)> 0 when um > 0. Assume also\nthat d(0)= 0. Let \u03c6 denote the initial data for um, so that um(t)=\u03c6(t) for all t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0]. Let\n\u03c6 be continuous and satisfy \u03c6(t)\u0001 0 for all t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0), and \u03c6(0)> 0. Then um(t), ui(t)> 0\nfor all t> 0.\nProof We \ufb01rst show that um(t)> 0 for all t \u2208 (0,\u221e). Assume, for contradiction, that there\nexists a \ufb01rst time t0 > 0 such that um(t0)= 0. Then um(t)> 0 for t \u2208 [0, t0) and\nu\u2032m(t0) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nb(um(t0 \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds\n=\n\u222b t0\n0\nb(um(t0 \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds+\n\u222b \u221e\nt0\nb(um(t0 \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds\n=\n\u222b t0\n0\nb(um(t0 \u2212 s))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n> 0\nf(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds+\n\u222b \u221e\nt0\nb(\u03c6(t0 \u2212 s))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u0001 0\nf(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds\n> 0.\nThus, u\u2032m(t0)> 0. This is a contradiction since it implies um(t) must be negative for t just\nbefore t0, which contradicts the choice of t0.\nProving that ui(t)> 0 for t> 0 is a little more di\ufb03cult. We shall \ufb01rst calculate the total\nnumber of individuals that are immature at time t=0 (i.e. the initial condition for ui).\nThis will be composed of all individuals born at times s< 0 who are still alive at t=0\nand have not yet matured by this time. For s \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0] the birth rate of immatures ui(s)\nis b(\u03c6(s)). So, for a typical s< 0, the number of births between times s and s + ds is\nb(\u03c6(s)) ds, for small ds. The number of these individuals still alive at time t=0 will be\nb(\u03c6(s))e\u2212\u03b3(0\u2212s)ds or b(\u03c6(s))e\u03b3sds. However, some of them may have already matured and\nwe need to remove these from the count. Now, since f(\u03be) d\u03be is the probability of becoming\nmature between age \u03be and \u03be + d\u03be (for d\u03be small), the probability of an individual born at\na particular time s< 0 having become mature before time t=0 will be\n\u222b \u2212s\n0\nf(\u03be) d\u03be (recall\ns< 0). Therefore, the fraction of the surviving individuals born at time s< 0 that are still\nimmature at time t=0 is 1 \u2212 \u222b \u2212s0 f(\u03be) d\u03be, or \u222b \u221e\u2212s f(\u03be) d\u03be. So, (\u222b \u221e\u2212s f(\u03be) d\u03be)b(\u03c6(s))e\u03b3s ds is the\nnumber of those born at time s< 0 that are still alive and still immature at time t=0. To\ntotal up the births from all negative times we integrate over s, obtaining\nui(0)=\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\n(\u222b \u221e\n\u2212s\nf(\u03be) d\u03be\n)\nb(\u03c6(s))e\u03b3s ds. (2.1)\nIn system (1.2) the initial conditions for ui and um are not independent of each other. The\ninitial value for ui is related to the initial data for um through expression (2.1). We will\nnow prove that the solution ui(t) of the \ufb01rst equation of system (1.2), subject to the initial\ncondition (2.1), is strictly positive for all t> 0. In fact, we shall do this by showing that\n40 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nthe solution is given explicitly by\nui(t)=\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\n(\u222b \u221e\nt\u2212s\nf(\u03be) d\u03be\n)\nb(um(s))e\n\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s) ds, (2.2)\nwhich is strictly positive, since we have already shown um(t) is positive.\nObviously ui(t) given by (2.2) satis\ufb01es the initial condition (2.1). We need to show\nthat (2.2) satis\ufb01es the di\ufb00erential equation for ui, the \ufb01rst equation of system (1.2). But\ndui\ndt\n=\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\n{(\u222b \u221e\nt\u2212s\nf(\u03be) d\u03be\n)(\u2212\u03b3b(um(s))e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s))\u2212 f(t \u2212 s)b(um(s))e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s)\n}\nds\n+\n(\u222b \u221e\n0\nf(\u03be) d\u03be\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=1\nb(um(t))\n= \u2212\u03b3ui(t) + b(um(t)) \u2212\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\nf(t \u2212 s)b(um(s))e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s) ds\n= \u2212\u03b3ui(t) + b(um(t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nf(s)b(um(t \u2212 s))e\u2212\u03b3s ds,\nso that the di\ufb00erential equation is satis\ufb01ed. \u0001\n3 Monotone birth functions\nThis section considers the case when the birth function b(um) in system (1.2) is increasing\nfor all um > 0. We will assume that the kernel f(s) has compact support, that is, f(s)= 0\nfor s\u0001 \u03c4 for some \u03c4> 0. This implies that no individual ever takes longer than \u03c4 units of\ntime to become mature. We still assume the kernel is normalised (see (A1) below).\nWhere we are interested in monotone birth functions, our assumptions may be summed\nup as:\n(A1) :\nThe kernel f satis\ufb01es f(s)= 0 for all s\u0001 \u03c4, for some \u03c4> 0, and\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s) ds=1. Also, b(0)= 0 and b(um) is strictly increasing for\nall um > 0, and d(0)= 0. Moreover, (3.1) has a root u\u02c6m > 0 with\nb(um)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds> d(um) when 0<um < u\u02c6m and b(um)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s\nds< d(um) when um > u\u02c6m.\nSince b(0)= d(0)= 0, (ui, um)= (0, 0) is an equilibrium of (1.2). The um component u\u02c6m of\nany other equilibrium has to satisfy\nb(u\u02c6m)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds= d(u\u02c6m). (3.1)\nExistence of a root u\u02c6m > 0 of (3.1) holds under (A1). In this case the ui component u\u02c6i of\nthe equilibrium is given by\nu\u02c6i =\nb(u\u02c6m)\n\u03b3\n(\n1 \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\n> 0. (3.2)\nWe will prove the following theorem.\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 41\nTheorem 2 Let (A1) hold, and assume that um(t)\u0001 0 for \u2212\u03c4\u0002 t< 0 and um(0)> 0. Then\num(t) \u2192 u\u02c6m and ui(t) \u2192 u\u02c6i as t \u2192 \u221e, where u\u02c6m and u\u02c6i are given by (3.1) and (3.2),\nrespectively.\nRemark For ecological realism ui(0) should be given by (2.1). However Theorem 2 can be\nproved without any restriction on ui(0).\nProof The proof is in several stages. We \ufb01rst prove that the solution um(t) of\nu\u2032m(t)=\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(um(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(um(t)) (3.3)\nsatis\ufb01es um(t) \u2192 u\u02c6m and will \ufb01rst consider the case in which um(t) is eventually monotone\n(i.e. monotone for all t su\ufb03ciently large). It is easy to see that um(t) cannot be eventually\nmonotonic increasing and go to +\u221e since otherwise (3.3) yields, for all t su\ufb03ciently large,\nu\u2032m(t)=\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(um(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(um(t))\u0002 b(um(t))\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(um(t))< 0.\nThus if um(t) is eventually monotonic increasing then it must tend to a limit. If um(t) is\neventually monotonic decreasing then, by positivity of solutions, um(t) must approach a\nlimit but in principle the limit could be zero and this is what we must rule out next.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that um(t) \u2192 0 and let t0 be su\ufb03ciently large that, for all t\u0001 t0,\num(t)< u\u02c6m. Let\n\u00b5= min\nt\u2208[t0 ,t0+\u03c4]\num(t).\nThen \u00b5< u\u02c6m and, by Theorem 1, \u00b5> 0. To obtain a contradiction it su\ufb03ces to show that\num(t)>\u00b5 for all t\u0001 t0 + \u03c4. If the latter were false then there would exist a t\u2217\u0001 t0 + \u03c4 such\nthat um(t\n\u2217)= \u00b5, um(t)\u0001 \u00b5 for all t \u2208 [t\u2217 \u2212 \u03c4, t\u2217] and u\u2032m(t\u2217)\u0002 0. But then (3.3) gives\nu\u2032m(t\u2217)=\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(um(t\n\u2217 \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(\u00b5)\u0001 b(\u00b5)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(\u00b5)> 0\nsince \u00b5< u\u02c6m. Thus um(t) cannot approach zero. As a result of what has been ruled out\nabove, we must now conclude that any eventually monotone solution approaches a non-\nzero limit, say u\u00afm. This limit must be an equilibrium of (3.3) and so, since u\u00afm > 0, we must\nhave u\u00afm = u\u02c6m.\nWe now consider the case when um(t) is not eventually monotonic. Of the various\npossibilities which then arise, it will be su\ufb03cient for us to consider the case when the\ngraph of um(t) has an in\ufb01nite sequence of maxima greater than u\u02c6m (other cases can be\ndealt with similarly). So, there exists a sequence of times {tj}, j=1, 2, . . . such that tj \u2192 \u221e\nas j \u2192 \u221e, t1\u0001 2\u03c4, um(tj)> u\u02c6m, u\u2032m(tj)= 0 and u\u2032\u2032m(tj)< 0.\nWe claim that sup t\u0001 t1um(t)= um(tk), for some integer k. For if not, then there exists a\nsubsequence, still denoted {tj}, such that um(tj)>um(t) for 2\u03c4< t< tj , tj \u2192 \u221e as j \u2192 \u221e.\nThis is because, if our claim is not true, then beyond every local maximum of um(t) there\nmust be another that is even higher. The subsequence is generated by including each\n42 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nmaximum that is higher than every maximum before it. Then, from (3.3),\nu\u2032m(tj)<b(um(tj))\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds \u2212 d(um(tj))< 0,\nsince um(tj)> u\u02c6m. This is a contradiction since u\n\u2032\nm(tj)= 0.\nNow let s1 = tk . By the same arguments applied to the interval t\u0001 tk+1 we can \ufb01nd\na tl (l > k) such that sup t\u0001 tk+1um(t)= um(tl). Let s2 = tl . We can continue this process to\n\ufb01nd tn (n> l) such that sup t\u0001 tl+1um(t)= um(tn). Similarly, we de\ufb01ne s3, s4, . . . , the sequence\n{sj} having the property that sj < sj+1, sj \u2192 \u221e as j \u2192 \u221e and um(sj)>um(t) for all t> sj\n(in particular um(sj)>um(sj+1)). Also, u\n\u2032\nm(sj)= 0 and each um(sj)> u\u02c6m. These observations\nimply that \u03b1j : = um(sj) approaches a limit \u03b1 as j \u2192 \u221e, with \u03b1\u0001 u\u02c6m, and we have to show\nthat \u03b1= u\u02c6m.\nFrom the sequence {sj} choose a subsequence, again denoted {sj}, such that sj \u2212\u03c4\u0001 sj\u22121.\nFrom (3.3) evaluated at t= sj , and the fact that um(t)\u0002 um(sj\u22121) for t\u0001 sj\u22121, we have\nd(\u03b1j) =\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(um(sj \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n\u0002 b(\u03b1j\u22121)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds.\nLetting j \u2192 \u221e gives d(\u03b1)\u0002 b(\u03b1) \u222b \u03c40 f(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds which, from the hypotheses of the the-\norem, implies \u03b1\u0002 u\u02c6m. Together with \u03b1\u0001 u\u02c6m, this implies \u03b1= u\u02c6m. We have shown that\nlimt\u2192\u221e um(t)= u\u02c6m.\nTo complete the proof we need to show that limt\u2192\u221e ui(t)= u\u02c6i. This is straightforward.\nIn view of the assumption of f(s) having compact support, the \ufb01rst equation of (1.2), as\nt \u2192 \u221e, becomes\nu\u2032i(t)=\u2212\u03b3ui(t) + b(u\u02c6m)\n(\n1 \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\nand therefore ui(t) \u2192 u\u02c6i, given by (3.2).\nThis argument can be made rigorous by using the theory of asymptotically autonomous\ndi\ufb00erential equations (see, for example, Mischaikow et al. [4]). \u0001\n4 The e\ufb00ect of di\ufb00usion\nIn this section we study the e\ufb00ect of adding di\ufb00usion terms to system (1.2) to model\nthe situation when individuals can drift around. We shall take the di\ufb00usion to be of the\nsimplest reasonable kind for models in continuous space which is Fickian di\ufb00usion. In this\nrepresentation of di\ufb00usion the individuals are performing a random walk and, for a model\nwithout delay, the di\ufb00usion would be modelled by adding Laplacian terms to the right\nhand sides of the equations to obtain a reaction-di\ufb00usion system. When delays are present\nthe situation is a little more complicated because the individuals may have moved during\nthe period of the time delay (the maturation delay, in our case). In consequence, the time\ndelay terms in the resulting system assume a somewhat more complicated appearance. In\na \ufb01nite N dimensional spatial domain \u2126 with impermeable boundaries, we shall argue that\nif Di and Dm denote the di\ufb00usivities of the immature and mature members respectively,\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 43\nthen an appropriate reaction di\ufb00usion extension of system (1.2) is\n\u2202ui(x, t)\n\u2202t\n= Di\u2206ui(x, t) + b(um(x, t)) \u2212 \u03b3ui(x, t) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds,\n\u2202um(x, t)\n\u2202t\n= Dm\u2206um(x, t) +\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds \u2212 d(um(x, t)), (4.1)\nfor x \u2208 \u2126 \u2282 RN , t> 0, subject to the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions\nn \u00b7 \u2207ui = n \u00b7 \u2207um =0 on \u2202\u2126\nwhere n is an outward pointing normal to \u2202\u2126. The initial conditions for (4.1) are\nui(x, 0)= u\n0\ni (x), um(x, s)= u\n0\nm(x, s), (x, s) \u2208 \u2126 \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] (4.2)\nwhere u0i and u\n0\nm are prescribed. In system (4.1), G(x, y, t) is the solution, subject to\nhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, of\n\u2202G\n\u2202t\n=Di\u2206xG, G(x, y, 0)= \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\nwhere \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function, and where \u2206x means the Laplacian computed with\nrespect to the \ufb01rst argument of G(x, y, t) (recall that x is a vector in RN here), and y \u2208 RN\nis for these purposes a parameter. It is easy to see that\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, t) dx=\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, t) dy=1\nfor all t\u0001 0. Note also that the second equation of (4.1) involves both of the two\ndi\ufb00usivities Di and Dm since the kernel G involves Di.\nLet us now derive the term with the double integral (the adult recruitment term) in the\nright hand side of the second equation of (4.1), assuming that the birth rate at a particular\nlocation and time is some function of the number of adults at that point in space at that\ntime. Let u(x, t, a) be the density of individuals of age a at location x \u2208 \u2126 at time t. Fix s> 0.\nAt (x, t) we want to calculate the rate of adult recruitment, i.e. the rate at which individuals\nare just reaching maturity. Of all the individuals just reaching maturity, some will have\ntaken time s to mature (more precisely, an amount of time between s and s+ ds with ds\nin\ufb01nitesimal). Let us look at these individuals \ufb01rst. They will have been born at various\nlocations in \u2126 and will have drifted around, being at point x on becoming mature. During\ntheir juvenile phase let us assume they evolved according to the von Foerster type equation\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202a\n=Di\u2206u \u2212 \u03b3u, x \u2208 \u2126, 0<a< s\nwith homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and subject to\nu(x, t, 0)= b(um(x, t))\nwhere b is the birth function. Our aim at this stage is to \ufb01nd an expression for u(x, t, s)\nin terms of um.\n44 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nLet v(x, r, a)= u(x, a+ r, a). Then\n\u2202v\n\u2202a\n=\n[\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202a\n]\nt= a+r\n= [Di\u2206u \u2212 \u03b3u]t= a+r\n= Di\u2206u(x, a+ r, a) \u2212 \u03b3u(x, a+ r, a)\nso that\n\u2202v\n\u2202a\n=Di\u2206v \u2212 \u03b3v, x \u2208 \u2126, a> 0 (4.3)\nwith\nv(x, r, 0)= b(um(x, r)). (4.4)\nThe solution of (4.3) subject to (4.4) is\nv(x, r, a)= e\u2212\u03b3a\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, a)b(um(y, r)) dy\nwhere the kernel G is the function described above. Hence\nu(x, t, s)= e\u2212\u03b3s\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)b(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy.\nThe above quantity gives us the rate, at (x, t), at which individuals are becoming mature\nhaving taken time s to mature. The total rate, at (x, t), at which individuals become mature\nis \u222b \u03c4\n0\nu(x, t, s)f(s) ds\nor \u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds.\nReaction-di\ufb00usion systems with delay have been of interest to investigators for around\ntwenty years now. Systems similar to (4.1), but without the integral with respect to y,\nwere studied by Yamada [6, 7]. Reaction-di\ufb00usion systems which have both delay and\nnonlocal spatial e\ufb00ects are more recent. The results we shall prove in this paper utilise\ncomparison principles due to Martin & Smith [3] which have been developed in abstract\nsettings that allow both time delay and spatial integration.\nIn the rest of this section, we prove theorems on the dynamics of system (4.1), considering\nseparately the cases when the birth function is always increasing, and the case of a birth\nfunction b(um) that qualitatively resembles Pume\n\u2212Aum with A, P positive parameters. This\nparticular case is of some importance in modelling certain insect populations [2]. We will\nrestrict attention to kernels f(s) with compact support.\n4.1 Monotone birth functions\nWe will prove Theorem 3. Note that in the theorem there are no restrictions on the initial\ndata for ui. However, one can infer, using considerations similar to those that led to the\nexpression for ui(0) in \u00a7 2, that for biological realism the initial data for ui has to be related\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 45\nto that for um by\nu0i (x)=\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\n\u222b\n\u2126\n{\u222b \u03c4\n\u2212s\nf(\u03be) d\u03be\n}\nb\n(\nu0m(y, s)\n)\ne\u03b3sG(x, y,\u2212s) dy ds\nalthough this is not necessary for Theorem 3 to hold.\nTheorem 3 Let (A1) hold, and let the initial data for system (4.1) satisfy u0m(x, s)\u0001 0 for\nall (x, s) \u2208 \u2126 \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] with u0m(x, 0)\u0001 0. Then the solution of (4.1), (4.2) satis\ufb01es\n(ui(x, t), um(x, t)) \u2192 (u\u02c6i, u\u02c6m)\nas t \u2192 \u221e, uniformly for x \u2208 \u2126, where u\u02c6i and u\u02c6m are given by (3.2) and (3.1).\nProof We shall \ufb01rst show that um(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6m. The second equation of (4.1) involves um\nonly. Note also that the kernel G in (4.1) is non-negative, as it is de\ufb01ned as the solution of\nthe heat equation with non-negative initial data. In view of these facts, and the fact that\nb(um) is increasing, a comparison principle holds for the second equation of (4.1). More\nprecisely, if u(x, t) and w(x, t) are two functions satisfying the homogeneous Neumann\nboundary conditions, the inequality\n\u2202u(x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2212 Dm\u2206u(x, t) + d(u(x, t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(u(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds\n\u0002 \u2202w(x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2212 Dm\u2206w(x, t) + d(w(x, t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(w(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds\n(4.5)\nfor t> 0, x \u2208 \u2126, and the inequality u(x, s)\u0002w(x, s) for (x, s) \u2208 \u2126 \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c4, 0], then\nu(x, t)\u0002w(x, t) in \u2126 \u00d7 (0,\u221e).\nThis result follows from the work of Martin & Smith [3]. The requirement that u and w\nshould satisfy the homogeneous Neumann boundary requirements can in fact be relaxed\nbut this fact is not helpful for our purposes here. By taking u(x, t) to be um(x, t), the\nsolution of the second equation of (4.1) subject to (4.2), and w(x, t) independent of x and\nequal to w(t) where\nw\u2032(t)=\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(w(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds \u2212 d(w(t)),\nw(s)= max\nx\u2208\u2126\num(x, s), s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0],\nwe have um(x, t)\u0002w(t) in \u2126 \u00d7 (0,\u221e). But the limiting behaviour of w(t) is known from\nTheorem 2. Thus\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nmax\nx\u2208\u2126\num(x, t)\u0002 lim\nt\u2192\u221ew(t)= u\u02c6m. (4.6)\nIf we can also show that\nlim inf\nt\u2192\u221e minx\u2208\u2126\num(x, t)\u0001 u\u02c6m, (4.7)\n46 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nthen we will have established that um(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6m uniformly in x. Proving (4.7) is similar to\nproving (4.6), but in the comparison principle we now take w(x, t) as the solution um(x, t)\nof the second equation of (4.1) subject to (4.2), and u(x, t) independent of x and equal to\nu(t), the solution of\nu\u2032(t)=\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(u(t \u2212 s))f(s)e\u2212s\u03b3 ds \u2212 d(u(t)), t > 0,\nu(s)= min\nx\u2208\u2126\num(x, s), s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0].\n(4.8)\nAgain we invoke Theorem 2 to deduce the limiting behaviour of u(t), and (4.7) follows\nimmediately. The only possible problem here is that the minimum in (4.8) could be zero\nfor all s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] without violating the assumptions on the initial data stated in the\nTheorem (if this were the case then u(t) would be zero). However, our assumptions on u0m\nand the strong maximum principle imply that um(x, t)> 0 for all t> 0, x \u2208 \u2126. By changing\nthe origin of time to a value t0 such that um(x, t)> 0 for all t \u2208 [t0 \u2212 \u03c4, t0] and modifying\nthe comparison principle and (4.8) accordingly, we are assured of a comparison function\nu(t) which tends to u\u02c6m as t \u2192 \u221e. We have proved that um(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6m as t \u2192 \u221e.\nIt remains to prove that ui(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6i as t \u2192 \u221e. Since um(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6m,\nb(um(x, t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds \u2192 b(u\u02c6m)\n(\n1 \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\nas t \u2192 \u221e, and therefore also\nb(um(x, t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds \u2192 \u03b3u\u02c6i (4.9)\nusing (3.2), and recalling that f(s) has compact support here. Furthermore, the convergence\nin (4.9) is uniform in x. Thus, letting \u03b5> 0 be arbitrary, there exists t1 > 0 such that, for\nall t\u0001 t1 and all x \u2208 \u2126,\nb(um(x, t)) \u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)f(s)e\u2212\u03b3sb(um(y, t \u2212 s)) dy ds\u0002 \u03b3u\u02c6i + \u03b5. (4.10)\nThen, for all t\u0001 t1 and all x \u2208 \u2126,\n\u2202ui(x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u0002Di\u2206ui(x, t) \u2212 \u03b3ui(x, t) + \u03b3u\u02c6i + \u03b5.\nBy comparison, ui(x, t) is bounded above by the solution u\u02dci(x, t) of the linear reaction-\ndi\ufb00usion equation\n\u2202u\u02dci(x, t)\n\u2202t\n=Di\u2206u\u02dci(x, t) \u2212 \u03b3u\u02dci(x, t) + \u03b3u\u02c6i + \u03b5, t > t1,\non homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, satisfying u\u02dci(x, t1)= ui(x, t1) for each\nx \u2208 \u2126. Thus,\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nmax\nx\u2208\u2126\nui(x, t)\u0002 u\u02c6i + \u03b5\/\u03b3.\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 47\nThis result holds for all \u03b5> 0, and therefore it holds also when \u03b5=0. In a similar way, we\ncan show that\nlim inf\nt\u2192\u221e minx\u2208\u2126\nui(x, t)\u0001 u\u02c6i.\nWe deduce that ui(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6i as t \u2192 \u221e, uniformly in x. \u0001\n4.2 Non-monotone birth functions\nThe purpose of this section is to address the case when b(um) qualitatively resembles\nPume\n\u2212Aum (though we do not restrict to this speci\ufb01c example). We shall \ufb01nd in this\ncase that if u\u02c6m exists and is in the interval of um for which b(um) is increasing then\nglobal convergence to u\u02c6m follows. If u\u02c6m exceeds the value of um at which b(um) attains\nits maximum then the situation is much more delicate. This case will be studied using\nlinearised analysis. Our main assumptions for non-monotone b(um) are as follows.\n(A2) :\nThe kernel f satis\ufb01es f(s)= 0 for all s\u0001 \u03c4, for some \u03c4> 0, and\u222b \u03c4\n0 f(s) ds=1. Also, b(0)= 0, b(um)> 0 when um > 0, b(um) is di\ufb00er-\nentiable and strictly increasing up to some value umaxm and strictly de-\ncreasing for all um >u\nmax\nm . The death function d(um) is di\ufb00erentiable,\nstrictly increasing for all um > 0 and satis\ufb01es d(0)= 0.

Let the initial data for system (4.1)\nsatisfy u0m(x, s)\u0001 0 for all (x, s) \u2208 \u2126 \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] with u0m(x, 0)\u0001 0. Then the solution of (4.1),\n(4.2) satis\ufb01es\n(ui(x, t), um(x, t)) \u2192 (u\u02c6i, u\u02c6m)\nas t \u2192 \u221e, uniformly for x \u2208 \u2126, where u\u02c6i and u\u02c6m are given by (3.2) and (3.1).\nProof From the equation for um in (4.1),\n\u2202um(x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2212 Dm\u2206um(x, t) + d(um(x, t))\u0002 b(umaxm )\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\nin \u2126 \u00d7 (0,\u221e).

Therefore\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nmax\nx\u2208\u2126\num(x, t)\u0002 d\n\u22121\n(\nb\n(\numaxm\n) \u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\n.\nGraphical arguments, keeping in mind the assumption u\u02c6m < u\nmax\nm , can be used to show\nthat\nd\u22121\n(\nb\n(\numaxm\n) \u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\n<umaxm .\nLet \u03b5> 0 be su\ufb03ciently small that\nd\u22121\n(\nb\n(\numaxm\n) \u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\n+ \u03b5< umaxm .\nThere exists T > 0 such that, for all t\u0001T and all x \u2208 \u2126,\num(x, t)\u0002 d\n\u22121\n(\nb\n(\numaxm\n) \u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds\n)\n+ \u03b5.\nThen for all t\u0001T , um(x, t)\u0002 umaxm , and for all t\u0001T + \u03c4 there is no longer any record\nof um(x, t) ever having assumed values above u\nmax\nm . The proof that um(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6m now\nproceeds as if the birth function b(um) were increasing for all um, and so the result follows\nfrom Theorem 3. The proof that ui(x, t) \u2192 u\u02c6i is the same as for Theorem 3. \u0001\nIn the rest of this section we shall examine the case when u\u02c6m > u\nmax\nm . This case is much\nharder to study and so we shall con\ufb01ne ourselves to some linearised analysis in order\nto gain some insight into parameter regimes in which u\u02c6m might cease to be a stable\nequilibrium of the second equation of (4.1).\nWe shall assume (A2) holds, and that u\u02c6m > u\nmax\nm . Let (\u00b5k, \u03c6k(x)), k=0, 1, 2, . . . , be the\neigenvalues and (normalised) eigenfunctions of \u2212\u2206 on \u2126 with homogeneous Neumann\nboundary conditions. Then it is easy to see that\nG(x, y, t)=\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\ne\u2212Di\u00b5kt\u03c6k(x)\u03c6k(y)\nand that \u222b\n\u2126\nG(x, y, s)\u03c6k(y) dy= e\n\u2212Di\u00b5ks\u03c6k(x).\nNow let um(x, t)= u\u02c6m + v(x, t) where v is small. Substituting into the second equation\nof (4.1) and linearising, yields a linear equation for v(x, t) which has solutions of the form\nv= e\u03c3t\u03c6k(x) whenever\n\u03c3=\u2212Dm\u00b5k + b\u2032(u\u02c6m)\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212(\u03b3+\u03c3+Di\u00b5k)s ds \u2212 d\u2032(u\u02c6m). (4.11)\nWe will analyse (4.11) under assumption (A2) with u\u02c6m > u\nmax\nm . These assumptions force\nb\u2032(u\u02c6m)< 0. The structure of (4.11) enables us to apply a simple technique that leads an\neasily veri\ufb01able su\ufb03cient condition for all the roots \u03c3 of (4.11) to satisfy Re \u03c3 < 0 for\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 49\nall k=0, 1, 2, . . . (i.e. for the equilibrium u\u02c6m of the second equation of (4.1) to be linearly\nstable to arbitrary small perturbations). We assume there exists a root \u03c3\u2217 of (4.11) with\nRe \u03c3\u2217\u0001 0 and proceed towards a contradiction. If such a root exists, then\n|\u03c3\u2217 + Dm\u00b5k + d\u2032(u\u02c6m)| \u0002 |b\u2032(u\u02c6m)|\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212(\u03b3+Di\u00b5k)se\u2212(Re \u03c3\u2217)s ds\n\u0002 |b\u2032(u\u02c6m)|\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212(\u03b3+Di\u00b5k)s ds\nand it is easily seen that a contradiction is reached if\n|b\u2032(u\u02c6m)|\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212(\u03b3+Di\u00b5k)s ds<Dm\u00b5k + d\u2032(u\u02c6m). (4.12)\nThus, if (4.12) holds for all k=0, 1, 2, . . . , then u\u02c6m is linearly stable to arbitrary small\nperturbations. But the eigenvalues \u00b5k of \u2212\u2206 on homogeneous Neumann boundary con-\nditions satisfy 0= \u00b50 <\u00b51 <\u00b52 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7. Thus it is enough to require (4.12) to hold for k=0.\nWe have proved.\nTheorem 5 Let assumption (A2) hold, with u\u02c6m > u\nmax\nm , and assume further that\n|b\u2032(u\u02c6m)|\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nf(s)e\u2212\u03b3s ds< d\u2032(u\u02c6m). (4.13)\nThen the equilibrium u\u02c6m of the second equation of (4.1) is linearly stable to arbitrary small\nperturbations.\nOne situation in which (4.13) will hold is if u\u02c6m is not much larger than u\nmax\nm , since\nthen |b\u2032(u\u02c6m)| will be close to zero. Another situation in which (4.13) holds is if there is\nsigni\ufb01cant juvenile mortality (large \u03b3), but one must remember that the feasibility of the\nequilibrium u\u02c6m (i.e. strict positivity of u\u02c6m) depends on \u03b3. We can show that u\u02c6m decreases as\n\u03b3 increases, and that u\u02c6m may lose feasibility at a \ufb01nite value of \u03b3, or may remain feasible\nfor all \u03b3 (e.g. if the birth function is linear and the death function quadratic at small um,\nas in (1.1)). Naturally, the question arises as to whether u\u02c6m might lose stability while still\nfeasible, leading to new dynamical behaviour in the model. To investigate this possibility,\nlet us choose f(s)= \u03b4(s\u2212 \u03c4) (the choice appropriate for situations in which all individuals\ntake time \u03c4 to become mature), and b(um)=Pume\n\u2212Aum , d(um)= dmum with P , A and dm\npositive constants. In this case, u\u02c6m is given explicitly by\nu\u02c6m =\n1\nA\nln\n(\nPe\u2212\u03b3\u03c4\ndm\n)\nand is feasible only for Pe\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 > dm, i.e. only up to a \ufb01nite value of the juvenile mortality\nparameter \u03b3.\n50 J. F. M. Al-Omari and S. A. Gourley\nFor simplicity, we shall look at the eigenvalue equation (4.11) corresponding to spatially\nuniform perturbations (i.e. we take k=0), then\n\u03c3 + dm = dme\n\u2212\u03c3\u03c4\n(\n1 \u2212 ln\n(\nPe\u2212\u03b3\u03c4\ndm\n))\n. (4.14)\nWe are thus e\ufb00ectively studying the dynamics of the equation\nu\u2032m(t)= e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4Pum(t \u2212 \u03c4)e\u2212Aum(t\u2212\u03c4) \u2212 dmum(t), (4.15)\na slightly di\ufb00erent version of which was considered in Gurney et al. [2] as a model of\nthe Australian sheep-blow\ufb02y lucilia cuprina. The quantity P is the maximum rate of egg\nlaying per adult \ufb02y. Adult blow\ufb02ies live 2 to 3 weeks and typically during this time lay 2\nor 3 batches of eggs containing around 200 eggs per batch. This leads to a value P \u2248 28.6\neggs per adult per day. The maturation delay \u03c4 for blow\ufb02ies in Australia is typically about\n14 days. The parameter dm (adult mortality) is about 0.057. The parameter \u03b3 measures\njuvenile mortality (mortality during the larval and pupa stages); its value is rather more\ndi\ufb03cult to estimate but we have taken a value \u03b3 \u2248 0.05 which implies a through-stage\n(egg to adult) survival probability of about 0.5. With these values for the parameters,\nthe eigenvalue equation (4.14) has a pair of complex conjugate roots 0.029\u00b1 0.149i. These\neigenvalues predict a slowly growing oscillatory solution of the linearised equations and\nthus we are led to expect a \ufb01nite amplitude limit cycle of the nonlinear equation of period\napproximately 42.2 days. This is in good agreement with the dynamics of laboratory\npopulations as reported in Gurney et al. [2].\n5 Discussion\nWe have proposed a simple model for a single species population incorporating stage\nstructure and, in our opinion, a suitable means of dealing with situations in which the\nmaturation time is not always the same for all individuals. If the birth function b(um)\nis always increasing in um and a positive equilibrium exists in ecologically reasonable\ncircumstances (by which we mean, essentially, that adult recruitment outnumbers deaths\nat low densities while the opposite is true at high densities) then, regardless of the\nprobability distribution function f(s) representing the likelihood of taking time s to\nmature, the asymptotic behaviour of the model is to an equilibrium population depending\non the distribution f(s).\nWe have also developed a reaction-di\ufb00usion extension of our model for the case of a\n\ufb01nite spatial domain with impermeable boundaries, and shown that as t \u2192 \u221e this model\nexhibits the dynamics described above if b(um) is increasing for all um > 0. The case of\na birth function b(um) qualitatively resembling Pume\n\u2212Aum is relevant for modelling some\ninsect populations, in which the birth rate is approximately proportional to the number\nof adults if the number of adults is small, but is e\ufb00ectively zero if there are many adults\nsince the adults may then have to devote so much energy to \ufb01nding enough food for\ntheir own survival that reproduction does not happen. See, for example, Gurney et al. [2]\nwhere this point is discussed in relation to populations of blow\ufb02ies. Such a non-monotone\nbirth function with a single hump e\ufb00ectively partitions parameter space into two zones.\nA nonlocal reaction-di\ufb00usion model 51\nThe \ufb01rst of these is for parameter values which have u\u02c6m < u\nmax\nm , so that the equilibrium\nis in the interval of values of um in which b(um) is increasing. In this case the interval\n[0, umaxm ] attracts the solutions and the long time dynamics is the same as if b(um) were\nincreasing for all um > 0. If u\u02c6m > u\nmax\nm then the outcome depends more sensitively on the\nprecise parameter values. If u\u02c6m is not too much bigger than u\nmax\nm (in a sense made precise\nby inequality (4.13)) then linear analysis predicts that solutions will still to tend to u\u02c6m, but\noscillatory dynamics are a possibility for larger u\u02c6m.\nReferences\n[1] Aiello, W.
