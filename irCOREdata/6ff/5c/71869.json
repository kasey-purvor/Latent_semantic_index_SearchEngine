These theoretical practices are also deeply intertwined in his \u201cabsolute \nhistoricism\u201d. This argument is useful not only because Gramsci regularly explores \ngeographical themes but also because \u2018bending the stick in the other direction\u2019 \nenriches our understanding of his overall approach. I do not claim that Gramsci was \na geographer manqu\u00e9 or was more a geographer than historian. These are \ndisciplinary questions inappropriate to the pre-disciplinary traditions of Italian \nphilosophy and historical materialism and to the political agenda of Italian state \nformation. Conversely, while it is certainly appropriate to consider, like Said (2001),1 \nthe import of Gramsci\u2019s familiar spatial metaphors, it would be misleading to focus \nexclusively on these here. For this would divert attention from Gramsci\u2019s less \nobvious but more significant analyses of the inherent spatiality as well as temporality \nof social relations. This approach had significant practical as well as theoretical \nimplications and is my primary focus here. \n \nSpatializing the Philosophy of Praxis \n \nGramsci writes that, while everyone is an intellectual, not everyone is an intellectual \nby social function (1971: 9). One might add that, while everyone has a practical \nsense of place, space, and scale, not everyone is a geographer by social function. \nThis certainly holds for Gramsci himself. He was a deeply spatial thinker but he did \nnot explicitly prioritize spatial thinking. This may explain both why Gramsci \u2018did not \nfully and explicitly develop his geographical insights\u2019 (Morera 1990: 89) and why the \ninherently spatial nature of his thought has been neglected. But he did take \ngeography seriously in various ways. He studied it alongside his major subject of \nphilology at Turin University (passing his geography exam in 1912). He \nrecommended its teaching in primary schools together with reading, writing, sums, \nand history; and that a potential textbook for party education contain a \u2018critical-\nhistorical-bibliographical examination of the regional situations (meaning by region a \ndifferentiated geo-economic organism) (Gramsci 1985: 691). He continued to explore \n 1\ngeology, geography, and geo-politics after leaving university and also taught history \nand geography in prison following his arrest (Hoare and Smith 1971: CD189, 171; \nGramsci 1985: 325, 272). He noted the mass popularity of geographical novels \n(1985: 590, 617ff); and recommended that Touring Clubs promote national culture by \ncombining geography with sport (1995: 288). He reflected on the geo-political and \ngeo-economic implications of the International Conferences in the 1920s for Italy, \nEurope, internationalism, and future world politics. And, more generally, he often \napproached political problems not only in terms of \u2018structural\u2019 factors but also in \nregional terms (cf. Morera 1990: 149), \n \nThese interests reflect his experiences as a Sardinian in the most exploited and \noppressed part of the Mezzogiorno (Southern Italy) and his movement to Turin, the \ncapital city of Piedmont and the North\u2019s industrial centre. They also derive from his \nreflections on more general influences in Italian economic, political, and cultural \ndevelopment. These include the Vatican\u2019s role as a cosmopolitan mini-state situated \nat the heart of Italy supported by a traditional intellectual elite with a long-established \nsupranational orientation managing for the leaders of Europe; the long-running \ndebate on the Southern Question in Italy (especially following the 1870s); the \nspatiality of the Risorgimento and the flawed nature of an Italian unification process \ndominated by the Piedmontese state; the continuing economic and social problems \nposed by uneven development, dependent development, and, indeed, internal \ncolonialism in Italy; the communists\u2019 political problems in breaking the class alliance \nbetween northern capital and the southern agricultural landowning class and in \nbuilding an alliance between the northern workers and southern peasants; the \nchanging nature and forms of imperialism (including the obstacles, challenges, and \nopportunities involved in the diffusion of Americanism and Fordism in Europe); and \nthe problems for the wider communist movement posed by the Soviet Union\u2019s \ninternational isolation.  \n \nGramsci\u2019s university training in philology under Umberto Bartoli also stimulated his \nspatial sensibilities. He followed the latter\u2019s new approach to linguistics as an \nhistorical science concerned with the social regularities of language (Gramsci 1985: \n174, 551). Bartoli developed a \u201cspatial\u201d analysis of language that sought to trace \n\u201chow a dominant speech community exerted prestige over contiguous, subordinate \n 2\ncommunities: the city over the surrounding countryside, the \u2018standard\u2019 language over \nthe dialect, the dominant socio-cultural group over the subordinate one\u201d (Forgacs \nand Nowell-Smith 1985: 000). He also charted the continuing flow of innovations \nfrom the prestigious langue to the receiving one, such earlier linguistic forms would \nbe found in a peripheral rather than central area, an isolated rather than an \naccessible area, a larger rather than a smaller area\u201d (Brandist 1996: 94-5). Gramsci \ninflected Bartoli\u2019s analysis in a strongly materialist direction and highlighted its \npractical implications. For he saw the problem of revolution as closely tied to the \nunification of the people \u2013 something that had to pass through the medium of \nlanguage if a coherent collective will was to emerge that could unify different classes, \nstrata, and groups (cf. Helsloot 1989: 561). The resulting complexities are evident \nfrom Gramsci\u2019s analyses of how language use is stratified (e.g., how countryfolk ape \nurban manners, how subaltern groups imitate the upper classes, how peasants \nspeak when they move to the cities, etc.) (1975: 2342). In short, there is a strong \nsense of spatiality in Gramsci\u2019s work on language as a medium of hegemony (Lo \nPiparo 1979, Ives 2004), \n \nThese influences suggest, as remarked earlier, that there is more to Gramsci as a \nspatial theorist than his use of spatial metaphors (on which, see box one). The latter \nhave certainly been influential in the reception of his work but we should also \nconsider his interest in the actual rather than metaphorical spatiality of social \nrelations and practices, in their spatial conditioning, and in their relevance to spatial \nissues. For Gramsci was not only sensitive to the historical specificity of all social \nrelations (Morera 1990: 85) but also to their distinctive location in place, space, and \nscale. Indeed these two are clearly interconnected. Thus I now consider how \nGramsci integrates place, space, and scale in his philosophy of praxis. However, \nbecause he does this in a largely pre-theoretical manner, these concepts must be \ndefined before illustrating their significance for Gramsci\u2019s theory and practice. \n \n___________________ \nBox One about here \n                                                 __________________ \n \n 3\nPlace (or locale) refers to a more or less bounded site of face-to-face relationships \nand\/or other direct interactions among relevant social forces. As such, it can be more \nor less extensive depending on whether such interactions require the co-presence of \nnamed individuals or representative individuals or can be mediated through \ndelegates from relevant organizations or movements. It is generally closely tied to \neveryday life, has temporal depth, and is bound up with collective memory and social \nidentity. Its boundaries serve both to contain and to connect: they provide a \nstrategically selective social and institutional setting for direct interactions and also \nstructure possible connections to other places and spaces on a range of scales. The \nnaming, delimitation, and meaning of places are always contested and changeable \nand the coordinates of any given physical space can be connected to a multiplicity of \nplaces with different identities, spatio-temporal boundaries, and social significance. \nGramsci was sensitive to all of these aspects. The importance of place is stressed in \nhis reflections on folklore, common sense, popular culture, and political practice. It is \nalso illustrated in his discussion of built forms (schools, churches, architecture) and \neven street names (references). Gramsci also noted the contestability of places, their \nintertwining with other places, and their links to memory, identity, and temporality \n(Gramsci 1971: 00-00; 1978: 00-00). Thus Gramsci was interested in folklore \nbecause it was characteristic of the subaltern and provincial classes and opposed to \nofficial conceptions of the world \u2013 it was one way in which subaltern classes \nrationalized and survived in the world (Landy 1994: 175). Likewise, he explored the \nsocial origins of intellectuals in relation to their roots in specific places and spaces \nrather than in a-spatial class terms. For example, he distinguished between the \nsocial functions of northern (industrial, technical) and southern (rural, organic) \nintellectuals in building different types of hegemony (1978: 454-5); and observed that \ntraditional Italian intellectuals had historically played a cosmopolitan rather than \nnational role (1985 205). In other situations, intellectuals and political parties could \nalso be the relays of ideas \u2018borrowed from other national sources\u2019 rather than \ndevelop an authentic and inclusive national-popular culture (1985 205). Gramsci also \nargued the social bases of economic policies and strategies -- laissez-faire, laissez-\npasser could not be rooted in agriculture but only in commerce and strong industry. \nAnd his analysis of the Southern Question (see below) attaches great significance to \nthe rootedness (or otherwise) of social classes and political and intellectual forces in \nspecific places, spaces, and scales.  \n 4\n Space comprises the socially produced grids and horizons of social life. It offers a \nwhole series of strategically selective possibilities to develop social relations that \nstretch over space and time. Gramsci considers space from several viewpoints: (a) \nthe territorialization of political power and processes of state formation, (b) the spatial \ndivision of labour between town and countryside, between north and south, and \nbetween different regional and national economies, and (c) spatial imaginaries and \nthe representation of space. Gramsci did not believe that space exists in itself, \nindependently of the specific social relations that construct it, reproduce it, and occur \nwithin it. As a profoundly relational and practical thinker, he was never tempted by \nsuch spatial fetishism. Nor did he accept the geographical determinism common in \nthe nineteenth century \u201cscientific\u201d field and still reflected in folklore and common \nsense \u2013 a determinism that regards the physical and\/or human environment as the \nmost important determinant of social relations and their historical development. This \nwould have been anathema to Gramsci\u2019s philosophy of praxis too.2 Instead he \ntreated space like history, that is, in relational terms. For example, he regarded \nhistorical grammar (philology) comparatively, refusing to confine its development \nwithin national boundaries (Ives 1998: 45). He also argued 'that history is always \n\"world history\" and that particular histories exist only within the frame of world \nhistory\" (Gramsci 1985: 181). This is directly comparable to his view that national \nstates are not self-closed \u2018power containers\u2019 but should be studied in terms of their \ncomplex interconnections with states and political forces on other scales. Indeed he \nbrings both the temporal and spatial perspectives together in an early form of \n\u2018geographical historical materialism\u2019 (cf. Harvey 1982). \n \nScale comprises the nested (and sometimes not so nested) hierarchy of bounded \nspaces of differing size, e.g., local, regional, national, global. Scale is the product of \nsocial struggles for power and control. Gramsci was extremely sensitive to issues of \nscale, scalar hierarchies of economic and political power, and their territorial and \nnon-territorial expressions. Thus he conducted national analyses from an \ninternational viewpoint (e.g, the European bourgeoisie aimed to become the leading, \ndominant class throughout the Continent); he located the Italian revolution in a \nEuropean context, focusing on Piedmont's attempt to emulate the French \nbourgeoisie's catalytic role in Europe and to help shape a European historical bloc. \n 5\nHe also analyzed hegemonic relations at the local level, noting, for example, how the \nurban bloc around Paris dominated other French cities; how Giolitti attempted to \nform an urban bloc between the northern bourgeoisie and proletariat that could \nexercise hegemony over the southern Italian rural bloc; and how the modern \nautomobile city of Turin was a healthy and productive but the heavy industrial cities \nof Lombardy were corrupted by clientelism (Gramsci 1977: 150-3; Portelli 1973: 83-\n4; Levy 1999: 192). Arguments about different scales of economic, political, \nintellectual, and cultural organization were also central to his other analyses of \nhistorical blocs and, indeed, for individual identity formation. In the latter regard, for \nexample, he noted that Pirandello identified himself as local, national, and European \nand could only become an Italian and national writer because he had \ndeprovincialized himself and become European (1985: 000). Indeed, far from \naffirming that there is a simple \u2018nested hierarchy\u2019 of scales from the local to the \nglobal with distinct sets of economic, political, and social relations on each scale, \nGramsci he was especially sensitive to the ways in which tangled hierarchies of \nscale acted as a source of economic, political, and socio-economic instability.  \n \nScale dominance is 'the power which organizations at certain spatial scales are able \nto exercise over organizations at other, higher or lower scales' (Collinge 1999: 568). \nIt can derive from the general relationship among different scales considered as \nstrategically selective terrains of power and domination and\/or from the features \ncharacteristics, capacities, and activities of organizations located at different scales. \nOne or more scales can gain special socio-political significance by playing the \ndominant role in the scale division of labour among different social institutions. In \nturn, nodal scales are non-dominant overall but nonetheless serve as the primary \nloci for delivering certain activities in a given spatio-temporal order or matrix \n(Collinge 1999: 569). Finally, subaltern scales are marginal or peripheral but may \nalso become sites of resistance.  \n \nGramsci operates implicitly with such distinctions in analyzing historical and \ncontemporary patterns of domination. For example, he can be interpreted as arguing \nthat, within the nested (or, better, tangled hierarchy) of scales in Italian state- and \nnation-building, the national level was nodal rather than dominant. In a period when \nthe primacy of the national scale \u2013 economically, politically, socio-culturally \u2013 was \n 6\nincreasingly taken for granted, at least in the advanced capitalist societies of the \n\u2018West\u2019. For Gramsci lived in a conjuncture when, Italia fatta, bisogna fare gli Italiani \n(Italy being made, we must make the Italians). In short, whatever the general \nimportance of the national scale in the international state system, Italy was weakly \nintegrated domestically and the national scale had not yet become dominant over \nlocal and regional scales.  \n \nNor was Gramsci unaware of the international weakness of the Italian state and the \ninfluence of external factors on its development. For example, the Vatican was not \njust a local religious institution but a source of Italy\u2019s place in the larger world, with \nCatholicism functioning as a worldwide hegemonic institution, as an imperialistic \nspirit\" (1995: 220-1; cf. Saunders 1998: 181). He was therefore disinclined to regard \nthe national state as the basic unit of international relations. He also recognized the \ndistinction between dominant and nodal scales on a continental as opposed to the \nworld scale. Concerning European and World politics, for example, he wrote: \n \nThese two are not the same thing. In a duel between Berlin and Paris or \nbetween Paris and Rome, the winner is not master of the world. Europe has \nlost its importance and world politics depends more on London, Washington, \nMoscow, Tokyo than it does on the Continent. (1995: 374). \n \nThus his analyses of struggles for national hegemony were not confined to the \nnational but closely examined the articulation and, indeed, interpenetration, of the \nlocal, regional, national, and supranational scales. Moreover, Gramsci often \ncommented on the \u2018strategic selectivities\u2019 associated with the dissociation of scales \nacross different institutional orders and\/or the possibilities of scale jumping (e.g., the \nhistory of Italian intellectuals, the disjunction between the increasing formation of the \nworld market and the continued survival of national states). Likewise, he predicted \nthat the diffusion of both Americanism and Fordism (so that they were mutually \nsupportive) could transform economic, political, and socio-cultural relations in \nEurope. He also identified and elaborated the need for new forms of interscalar \narticulation to form a new historic bloc and mobilize multiple social forces (e.g., in \norder to resolve the Southern Question or to enable the Soviet Union to break out of \n 7\nthe isolation produced by Stalin\u2019s policy of \u2018socialism in one country\u2019). And, reflecting \nin particular on the experience of the Italian intellectuals, he notes that: \n \nSince every national complex is an often heterogeneous combination of \nelements, it may happen that its intellectuals, because of their \ncosmopolitanism, do not coincide with the national content, but with a content \nborrowed from other national complexes or even with a content that is abstract \nand cosmopolitan (1985: 205). \n \nGramsci\u2019s interests in place, space, and scale are combined in investigations on a \nwide range of topics. I cannot examine them all below but they include: (a) the social \nconstitution of categories such as \u2018North-South\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019, their reflection \nof the viewpoint European cultured classes, their ideological representation of \ndifferences between civilizations, and their material significance in practical life \n(Gramsci 1971: 810); (b) the strategic selectivities associated with the dissociation of \nscales across different institutional orders and\/or the possibilities of scale jumping, \ne.g., the cosmopolitanism and external orientation of traditional intellectuals in Italy \nfrom Imperial Rome to the contemporary Catholic Church based in Rome and their \nimpact of Italian and European politics; (c) the medieval communes and their \neconomic-corporate urban regimes; (d) relationships between town\/city and \ncountryside and their geographical modalities in different countries; (e) the tangled \nhierarchy of scales as a source of economic, political, and socio-economic instability \n(e.g., Piedmont); (f) new forms of interscalar articulation to form a new historic bloc \nand mobilize multiple social forces (e.g., in order to resolve the Southern Question); \n(g) the reconstruction of scale in response to the crisis of liberalism, dependent \ndevelopment and internal colonialism, and the rise of Americanism and Fordism; (h)  \nimperialism and imperialist rivalries within the context of a hierarchy of advanced \ncapitalist, semi-advanced, and peripheral capitalist states (e.g., England and \nGermany, France and Czechoslovakia, and Italy respectively (Ghosh 2001: 3-4); and \n(j) the possibility of revolution in advanced capitalist states (the \u2019West\u2019) following the \nRussian Revolution (in the \u2019East\u2019). More generally, Gramsci was interested in the \nrelative coherence of different scales of economic and political organization and their \nsocial and cultural presuppositions. For example, in a familiar argument in Marxist \nanalyses of the world market and imperialism, Gramsci remarks that: \n 8\n One of the fundamental contradictions is this: that whereas economic life has \ninternationalism, or better still cosmopolitanism, as a necessary premiss, \nstate life has developed ever more in the direction of \u2018nationalism\u2019, of \u2018self-\nsufficiency\u2019 and so on (1995:  353). \n \nGramsci and the Southern Question \n \nThe Southern Question was posed in many ways as a central problem in Italian \nstate- and nation-building. Gramsci analyses these twin processes in terms of the \n\u2018passive revolution\u2019 that occurred as the Italian northern bourgeoisie sought to \nunify the peninsular in the face of a heterogeneous and divided population and \nvast regional disparities (Davis 1982; Morera 1990: 149). Italy\u2019s weak economic, \npolitical, and social integration and the lack of dominance of the national scale \ninform Gramsci\u2019s early political writings, the \u2018Lyons Theses\u2019 (co-authored with \nTogliatti), and his incomplete essay on \u2018Some Aspects of the Southern Question\u2019 \n(1926). These discuss three issues: (a) the complex, multi-layered economic and \npolitical subordination of secondary centres of accumulation to the north and their \nimplications for class alliances; (b) the resulting complexities of class formation \nand regional disparities structures that block a Jacobin road to national unification; \nand (c) the problems this poses for the leading role of the proletariat, which is \u2018a \nminority of the working population and geographically distributed in such a \nmanner, that it cannot presume to lead a victorious struggle for power unless it \nhas previously resolved very precisely the problem of its relations with the peasant \nclass\u2019 (1977:  329). Thus, in their Lyons Theses, Gramsci and Togliatti write: \n \nIndustrialism, which is the essential part of capitalism, is very weak in Italy. Its \npossibilities for development are limited, both because of the geographical \nsituation and because of the lack of raw materials. It therefore does not \nsucceed in absorbing the majority of the Italian population (4 million industrial \nworkers exist side by side with 3\u00bd million agricultural workers and 4 million \npeasants). To industrialism, there is counterposed an agriculture which \nnaturally presents itself as the basis of the country\u2019s economy. The extremely \n 9\nvaried conditions of the terrain, and the resulting differences in cultivation and \nin systems of tenancy, however, cause a high degree of differentiation among \nthe rural strata, with a prevalence of poor strata, nearer to the conditions of the \nproletariat and more liable to be influenced by it and accept its leadership. \nBetween the industrial and agrarian classes, there lies a fairly extensive urban \npetty bourgeoisie, which is of very great significance. It consists mainly of \nartisans, professional men and State employees (1978: 343). \n \nGramsci takes this theme up again in his essay on the Southern Question. He claims \nthat the capacity of the Italian proletariat, which is a minority class and \ngeographically concentrated in the north, to become the leading (dirigente) and \ndominant class depends on its capacity to form class alliances, mobilizing in \nparticular the real consent and active support of the broad peasant masses (1978; \n1977: 328-9). But he adds the peasant question is historically determined in Italy; it is \nnot the \u201cpeasant and agrarian question in general\u201d. In Italy the peasant question, \nthrough the specific Italian tradition, and the specific development of Italian history, \nhas taken two typical and particular forms \u2013 the Vatican and Southern Questions \n(1978: 443; cf. 1977: 328-9). \n \nThis argument, his earlier analyses, and his Prison Notebooks all involve a deeply \nspatialized rather than a-spatial analysis of classes, social categories, and political \nforces. Gramsci identified five forces crucial forces in postwar Italy: (1) the northern \nurban force; (2) the southern rural force; (3) the northern\/central rural force; (4) the \nrural force of Sicily; and (5) the rural force of Sardinia. And, on this basis, he \nanalyzed the inter-regional relations on the analogy of a train whose engine would be \nthe northern urban force (cf. Morera 1990: 89). The key question then becomes \nwhich other forces should be mobilized by this locomotive to effect a rapid and \nsuccessful path to communism. Accordingly he recommended that the communist \nparty promote a hegemonic alliance of the proletariat with the peasantry and petty-\nbourgeois intellectuals and lead them in a war of position before the final military-\npolitical resolution of the conflict. This would dissolve the defensive alliance between \nnorthern industrialists and southern landowners, which also benefited from rural and \nurban petty-bourgeois support.  \n \n 10\nGramsci on Americanism and Fordism \n \nGramsci\u2019s vernacular materialism significantly frames his views on economic issues. \nRejecting classical and vulgar political economy as well economic liberalism and \neconomistic Marxism, he emphasized the broad historical location and specific \nspatio-temporal specificities of economic organization and economic regularities. \nThis is why he substituted the notion of mercato determinato (definite forms of \norganizing and regulating market relations with associated laws of tendency) for \ntranshistorical economic analysis based on the actions of rational economic man. \nThus he explored dependent development in the Mezzogiorno and the general \ntendency towards internal colonialism in Italy; the interrelations between different \neconomic places and spaces, including geographical variations in relationships \nbetween town and country and how different parties aimed to remodel this \nrelationship (Gramsci 1971 269); and the interconnection, articulation, and real or \npotential tensions between local, regional, national, international and transnational \neconomies. He was well-attuned to the spatial division of labour, the importance of \nscale in an emerging world market, and the conflict between place and space. And \nhe analyzed the class relations that follow from the spatiality of economic \norganization. In short, as Morera, an acute interpreter of Gramsci\u2019s \u2018absolute \nhistoricism\u2019, argues \u2018Gramsci not only rejected sociology for abstracting from time \nconditions, but also from space. That is, from the geographical conditions of social \nprocesses\u2019 (Morera 1990: 89).  \n \nTurning to international economic relations, he attacked liberalism for taking the \nnation-state as its horizon of economic policy-making and assuming that the world \neconomy could safely be left to market regulation (Vacca 1997: 160). Gramsci \nremarked upon the growing contradiction between cosmopolitanism in the world \nmarket and the nationalism of political life \u2013 which has to be the starting point for any \nmove to internationalism in the revolutionary socialist movement. Gramsci was \ninterested in the dynamics of uneven and combined development in an emerging \nglobal capitalism. His notes on Americanism and Fordism explored how the centre of \neconomic dynamism was moving from old Europe to the United States and was \nprompting Europe to adapt. He did not adopt a narrowly economically-determinist \nview of American economic progress \u2013 let alone a simplistic technological \n 11\ndeterminism. Instead he examined the specific historical and material conditions that \nhad enabled a new techno-economic paradigm to develop there, including the \nestablishment of an economia programmatica at the level of the enterprise, the \nfactory town, and the wider society. The originality and significance of Fordism as \naccumulation regime, mode of regulation, and way of life hindered its diffusion to \nEurope because this required more than the export of technical means of production \nand a technical division of labour. Nonetheless, to the extent that it did spread to \nEurope, it also facilitated the hegemony of American imperialism.   \n \nIn contrast to the Comintern, Gramsci emphasized the shift in the centre of economic \ngravity from Europe to the USA, which had developed a more rationally organized \neconomy. If workers could take the lead in adopting this model, it could become the \nbasis for working class to guide world historical development (Vacca 1999: 9; Baratta \n1997). But he also asked prophetically whether the centre of gravity might shift \nagain, this time from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  \n \nThe largest masses of the world\u2019s population are in the Pacific. If China and \nIndia were to become modern nations with great volumes of industrial \nproduction, their consequent detachment from a dependency on Europe would \nin fact rupture the current equilibrium: transformation of the American continent, \nshift in the axis of American life from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboard, etc. \n(1971: 326) \n \nGramsci on Territoriality and the State  \n \nGramsci did not naturalize or fetishize national territory as the pre-given or pre-\ndestined basis of state formation \u2013 and could not have done, indeed, given the \nhistorical problems of nation formation that he recognized and that he also struggled \nto overcome. The territorialization of political power is a crucial first material step in \nnational state formation and nation building..3 It is unsurprising, then, that Gramsci \nstudied the problems of the transition from medieval communes to absolutism and \nthence to a bourgeois liberal democratic state (e.g., Italy vs the Netherlands) and the \nneed to break out of the economic-corporate phase with its political fragmentation. \n\u201cThe chief defect of previous Italian history was not class oppression but the \n 12\nabsence of definite class formation, due to the fact that \u2018in Italy political, territorial \nand national unity enjoy a scanty tradition (or perhaps no tradition at all)\u2019 (Gramsci \n1971 274). Gramsci was also aware that territorial unity did not itself ensure political \nunity. This is apparent in his contrast between Bodin and Machiavelli:  \n \nBodin lays the foundations of political science in France on a terrain which is \nfar more advanced and complex than that which Italy offered to Machiavelli. \nFor Bodin the question is not that of founding the territorially united (national) \nState \u2013 i.e., of going back to the time of Louis XI \u2013 but of balancing the \nconflicting social forces within this already strong and well-implanted State. \nBodin is interested in the moment of consent, not in the moment of force \n(Gramsci 1971: 344) \n \nSecuring political unity also requires the institutional integration of the state through \nappropriate state forms, its embedding in the wider ensemble of societal relations, \nand its capacity to engage in relatively unified action through appropriate state and \nnational-popular projects. As symptoms of a failed national unification project in Italy, \nhe regularly cited the Vatican and Southern Questions and the passive revolution \nthat occurred under the domination of Piedmont and the Moderate Party. And, in one \nof his most famous comparisons in state theory, he claims that: \n \n\u2018In the East the state was everything, civil society was primordial and \ngelatinous; in the West, there was a proper relation between state and civil \nsociety, and when the state trembled a sturdy structure of civil society was at \nonce revealed\u2019 (1971: 000). \n \nThis approach raised crucial issues concerning passive revolution, hegemony, and \nthe historical bloc. Gramsci provides many other examples of problems in the \nmechanisms in and through which political unity is created and identifies an \nenormous variability in its forms \u2013 ranging from sheer coercion through force-fraud-\ncorruption and passive revolution to an inclusive hegemony. Nor did he see this \nmainly as a question of public administration or reform of the state apparatus \u2013 it was \ndeeply related to the social bases of the state. He therefore introduced a rich \nconceptual instrumentarium for analyzing class relations: ruling class, governing \n 13\nclass, governing party, class in charge of the state, the political class, functionaries \nas an intermediary stratum with the task of linking people and state, subaltern \nclasses, class alliance, class compromise, and so forth.  \n \nMoreover, in developing his analyses, he did not regard classes as disembedded, \nfree-floating entities but noted the impact of their spatial as well as social roots. This \nin turn implies the spatiality as well as the historicity of the state as a social relation.  \n \nThe chief defect of Italian intellectuals was not that they formed a powerful and \nresilient \u2018\u2018cultural hegemony\u2019\u2019, but that, because they were cosmopolitan rather \nthan national, no authentic hegemony had ever been realised. Like the artificial \nor perverted state hegemony of Piedmont, the cultural tradition deriving from \nthe Renaissance humanists could provide only a weak and eccentric form of \nhegemony, because it was not national\u2019 (Ghosh 2001: 36). \n \nGramsci and International Relations  \n \nAlthough Gramsci regrets the failure of the Italian nation-state compared with \nFrance\u2019s successful Jacobin state-building project, he is well aware that even this \ntook decades to accomplish and that contemporary nation-states were being forged \nin a much changed and deeply contested international context. For example, he \nsuggests that, whereas Versailles re-established the prerogatives of nation-states, \nthe Bolshevik world revolution project aimed at an eventual society of nations. After \nVersailles, the nation could no longer remain, if it ever had fully been, the dominant \nhorizon of state life. Thus it was crucial to analyze how the internal balance of forces \nwas overdetermined by international forces and a country\u2019s geo-political position and \nto assess whether and how the latter balance modifies domestic forces, reinforcing \nor breaking progressive and revolutionary movements (Gramsci 1971: 304). He \ntherefore deemed it \u2018necessary to take into account the fact that international \nrelations intertwine with these internal relations of nation-states, creating new, \nunique and historically concrete combinations\u2019 (1971: 406). He also noted that \nwinning international hegemony was partly an educational relationship, affecting \ncomplexes of national and continental civilizations (1971: 666). This applied not only \n 14\nto Americanism and Fordism but also to the role of the international communist \nmovement and its involvement in united front activities. \n \nWhen exploring the international dimensions of economic, political, and socio-\ncultural relations, Gramsci did not assume that the basic units of international \nrelations were national economies, national states, or nationally-constituted civil \nsocieties. Thus he saw the Vatican not just as a local religious institution but, as a \nform of religious imperialism, a worldwide hegemonic institution (Gramsci 1985: 220-\n1; Saunders 1998: 181). More generally, he explored the mutual implications of \nnested scales of economic and political organization, their social and cultural \npresuppositions, and the consequences of the dissociation of the dominant scales of \neconomic and political life. This made him sensitive to the complexities of interscalar \nrelations and he never assumed that they were ordered in a simple nested hierarchy.  \n \nGramsci\u2019s approach to international relations is interesting for six reasons. First, in \nwhereas Marx mainly developed an abstract-simple analysis of the capitalist mode of \nproduction, Gramsci took this analysis for granted and focused instead on concrete \nconjunctures in emerging and developed capitalist social formations in a world \nshaped by imperialism and the Bolshevik Revolution. Second, Gramsci integrated \nhis analysis of base and superstructure with concrete political analyses. This was a \nkey element in his concept of historical bloc and his systematic concern with the role \nof intellectuals in mediating these relations (see, for example, Portelli 1972). This \nanalysis extended beyond the national scale to the international (e.g., his analyses of \nAmericanism and Fordism and its diffusion in Europe or his concern with the \nBolshevik Revolution\u2019s failure to spread from the \u2018East\u2019 to the \u2018West\u2019). Third, in \nopposing economism both theoretically and politically, Gramsci showed the role of \npolitical and civil society in constituting and reproducing economic relations on \nscales up to and including the international. Fourth, in contrast to (neo-)realism in \nmore recent international relations theory, Gramsci did not fetishize the nation-state \nas the basic unit or scale of analysis. Indeed his work could be interpreted as a \nprotracted reflection on \u2018the failure of the Italian state to constitute itself as a national \nstate \u2013 a failure that reflects the laborious emergence of a modern Italian nation, \nimpeded by a balance of internal and international forces\u2019 (1985: 335).  \n \n 15\nFifth, writing during and after the Great War with its inter-imperialist rivalries and \nopen hostility between the capitalist bloc and the fledgling Soviet Union, Gramsci \nwas especially concerned with two issues: (a) the international as well as national \nand regional context of the defeat of the working class movement and the rise of \nfascism; and (b) the spread of Americanism and Fordism as the basis for \nmodernization in Italy and Europe more generally. Thus, in contrast to the \nComintern, Gramsci emphasized the shift in the centre of economic gravity from \nEurope to the USA, which had developed a more rationally organized economy, \nwhich could in turn become the basis for working class to guide world historical \ndevelopment (Vacca 2000: 9; Baratta 1997). Sixth, he was strongly interested in \ninternational relations and studied work on geo-politics and demo-politics (which \nwould now be called bio-politics) to better understand the political implications of the \ninternational balance of forces.  \n \nIn this context, and in contrast to the methodological nationalism that still affects \nmuch thinking on international relations, Gramsci did not draw a rigid distinction \nbetween the national and the international but explored issues of interscalar \narticulation and reciprocal influence in a more complex and dialectical manner.  \n \n\u2018Do international relations precede or follow (logically) fundamental social \nrelations? There can be no doubt that they follow. Any organic innovation in \nthe social structure, through its technical-military expressions, modifies \norganically absolute and relative relations in the international field too. Even \nthe geographical position of a national State does not precede but follows \n(logically) structural changes, although it also reacts back upon them to a \ncertain extent (to the extent precisely to which superstructures react upon \nthe structure, politics on economics, etc.). However, international relations \nreact both passively and actively on political relations (of hegemony among \nthe parties)\u2019 (1971: 398) \n.  \nGramsci explores the links between economic, political, and international strategy in \nhis analysis of the inter-linkage between domestic class alliances and foreign \neconomic policy. Italy\u2019s ruling class had to choose between rural democracy based \non \u2018an alliance with the Southern peasants, a policy of free trade, universal suffrage, \n 16\nadministrative decentralization and low prices for industrial products\u2019; or \u2018a \ncapitalist\/worker industrial bloc, without universal suffrage, with tariff barriers, with \nthe maintenance of a highly centralized State (the expression of bourgeois dominion \nover the peasants, especially in the South and the Islands), and with a reformist \npolicy on wages and trade\u2013union freedoms\u2019 (1978: 607). As Gramsci then \nimmediately added, it was no accident that the ruling class chose the latter solution.  \n \nConclusions  \n \nGramsci not only emphasized the historical specificity of all social relations but was \nalso less explicitly attuned to their distinctive location in place, space, and scale. \nThus almost all of his crucial concepts are sensitive to issues of place, space, and \nscale as well as to issues of periodization, historical structures, specific conjunctures, \nand social dynamics. Whether we consider the relations of production, the \ndetermined market (mercato determinato), the contrast between the dynamism of \nAmericanism and Fordism and the relative stagnation of European and Soviet \nplanned economies, the forms of class relations (economically, politically, \nintellectually), the territoriality of state formation and the relative strengths or \nweakness of specific states (considered both in terms of political and civil society), \nthe spatial roots of intellectuals and their different functions in economic, political, \nand moral organization, the nature of political alliances, the appropriate forms of \neconomic-corporate, political, and military strategy, etc., Gramsci emerges as a \nspatial thinker as much as he does as an historical thinker. This is rooted in his \nprofoundly historicist concern with the spatio-temporality of all social relations. In \naddition, Gramsci\u2019s analysis of strategy was objectively as well as metaphorically \nsensitive to temporality and spatiality. Not only did Gramsci emphasize the \ninterweaving of different temporalities into complex conjunctures and situations and \nsearch for the openings between a path-dependent present and possible futures. But \nhe also regarded strategy as inherently spatial. He was always aware of the need to \nmobilize in and across specific places, spaces, and scales, each with their own \ndistinctive determinations and strategic selectivities. At stake in both cases is the \ntransformation of spatio-temporal horizons of action and the interweaving of different \ntemporalities and spatialities. It is only in this context that his notions of war of \nposition and war of manoeuvre make sense. For Gramsci\u2019s interest in place, space, \n 17\nand scale was not merely academic but had to do with his analysis of revolutionary \nconjunctures. Thus he argues that a collective will must be formed \u2018with the degree \nnecessary and sufficient to achieve an action which is co-ordinated and \nsimultaneous in the time and the geographical space in which the historical event \ntakes place\u2019 (1971 426-7). In short, his comments on the political failures of left \nstrategy are also spatially as well as historically attuned. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBrandist, C.

Indeed, as \nPandolfi notes, his 'vision of territory differed from the dangerous and arrogant \ncategorizations of some proponents of the Southern Question, and he was careful to \ndissociate himself from their essentialism. Such geographical determinisms \u2026 only \nlegitimated the authoritarian and imperialistic stances of the North. Rather, \nterritoriality was a political perimeter; it referred to a peripheral place subject to \nimperial and strategic domination by the center' (1998: 286). \n3 Gramsci notes how Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n, a Swedish sociologist, sought to \u2018construct a \nscience of the state and of politics on a new basis, taking as his starting point the \nterritorial unit as organised politically (development of the geographical sciences\u2014\nphysical geography, anthropography, geo-politics) and the mass of human beings \nliving in society on that territory (geo-politics and demopolitics)\u2019 (1995: 325). \n \n"}
