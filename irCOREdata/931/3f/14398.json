It discusses the findings of several of the keynote\nspeakers and presenters within the context of the relationship between technology, practice and\ninnovation. It references the papers presented in the technology infrastructure and new technology\nstrands of the conference to examine whether educational technology currently has an appropriate\nbalance between innovation and good practice. It then presents a case study of application in prac-\ntice through some of the development activities that a national funding body, the JISC, has put into\nplace. Finally, it draws conclusions about how well the learning technology community is achieving\nappropriate balance between innovation and technology.\nThis discussion piece reflects on the papers presented at ALT-C 2004 that were\nunder the \u2018technical infrastructure\u2019 and \u2018new technology\u2019 strands of the conference.\nThe theme of the conference focused on looking forward to the future: \u2018learning tech-\nnologies for the next decade\u2019, with a bridging subclause that connected two seemingly\ncontradictory or conflicting terms \u2018blue skies and pragmatism\u2019. There are a highly\ncomplex set of relationships between \u2018innovative\u2019, \u2018risky\u2019 or \u2018blue skies\u2019 technology\nand its effective use in supporting practitioners or \u2018pragmatism\u2019. It may seem a chal-\nlenging question to ask at a conference that is focused on technology, but from the\nopening keynote we were asked indirectly to focus upon the question: \u2018why innovate?\u2019\n(Kumar, 2004). Kumar reached the conclusion that we should not simply innovate\nfor the sake of it but in order to offer an improved or even an extended and better\nexperience: \u2018Technology doesn\u2019t just allow students to answers questions more\nquickly, but to ask new questions\u2019 (Kumar, 2004). This sets the tone for some of the\nmost fascinating discussions of the conference, such as: What should be the relation-\nship between technology and practice? Should technology stimulate innovation in\npractice or should technology support practice? Or is it able to do both? At what point\n*Joint Information Systems Committee, King\u2019s College London, Strand Bridge House, 138\u2013142\nThe Strand, London, WC2R 1HH. Email: s.porter@jisc.ac.uk\n232 S. Porter\nshould innovation become \u2018embedded\u2019 into practice and how can this be achieved?\nThis discussion piece will reflect on the extent to which these questions were\naddressed in the papers at the conference.\nIn the opening session of the conference I was asked to give a brief overview of what\nI saw as the key issues for \u2018my\u2019 conference themes\u2014\u2018Technical infrastructure\u2019 and\n\u2018New technology\u2019. In order to further explore these relationships during the apparently\nmost technically-focused sessions of the conference, I focused upon the complex rela-\ntionship between people and technology and posed three questions that I hoped we\nwould be in a better position to answer by the closing session at the end of the confer-\nence. The three questions were: \n\u25cf Is technology changing practice?\n\u25cf Is it improving the student learning experience?\n\u25cf Do we have the balance right between technology and practice?\nTo illustrate the tension and compromise that is inherent in the final question, I\nused a simple diagram; a vertical axis labelled technology, a horizontal axis labelled\npractice, and a dotted line that mapped a diagonal line between the two that was\nlabelled \u2018innovation\u2019. The implication of the diagram was that in continuing to move\nforward with both technology and practice, we should innovate in both areas, while\nalso attempting to maintain a balance between innovation in practice and innovation\nin technology. Technology should not dominate this progress, but neither should we\nassume that practice will not change over time; both should co-evolve.\nDuring many of the sessions in both the technology and technical infrastructure\nstrands, I attempted to pursue the issue of the relationship between innovation, tech-\nnology and practice. It was fascinating to discover that, in drawing their conclusions,\nmany of the speakers focused upon the intersection and tension between two or all\nthree of these themes. Through the sessions, we began also to illuminate and, to some\nextent, to address the questions that I posed in the opening session.\nIs technology changing practice?\nThere were numerous examples given during the papers of how technology is influ-\nencing practice, for example Keefe\u2019s (2004) paper on the way in which mobile tech-\nnology offers potential for more personalised learning. However, this was tempered\nwith the realisation that there was a need for practitioners to evolve their own practice\nthrough engaging in experimentation and that practitioners need to go through their\nown cycle of evolution to change the way they work. As Gunn (2004) pointed out\n\u2018However many examples of good practice there are, people need to learn from their\nown process of trial and error\u2019.\nIt was also acknowledged that in some cases engagement with technologies will\nactually result in practitioners finding a solution to problem, precisely because they\nwant to try something new. The conference papers included many examples of how\ntechnology is changing practice; for example, Keefe\u2019s (2004) paper on mobile tech-\nnologies demonstrated that they enabled a more \u2018populist and personal approach\u2019 to\nRelationship between technology and practice 233\nlearning. This suggests, therefore, that there is evidence that technology is changing\npractice, but that the relationship between the two is complex and interdependent.\nIs technology improving the student learning experience?\nReference to the learning experiences of students was not the main focus of many of\nthe presentations I attended. However, several presentations referred to a general\nimprovement in the student experience, although not specifically their learning\nexperience. A good example of this improvement is the way in which technology can\nbe used to encourage teachers and students to be more reflective (e.g. through appro-\npriate use of discussion forums or e-portfolios). In his fascinating and engaging\nsession on personal development planning, Rowsell drew upon his own experience to\ndescribe how art students improved their practice as learners by encouraging more\nreflection; by using SMS technology, or \u2018moblogs\u2019 (mobile logs), to build up journals,\nthus reflecting on their practice. He concluded that: \u2018technology can make you a\nbetter teacher and a more reflective learner\u2019 (Rowsell, 2004).\nThere were other issues that focused on the relationship between technology and\nthe student or practitioner experience. There was a theme across several sessions\nsuggesting that technology could improve interaction by providing enhanced forms of\ncommunication. McCabe referred to using technology to act as an \u2018intermediary\nbetween student and tutor\u2019. Heins referred to the fact that learners and teachers want\ntechnology that can afford the same kind of serendipitous communications that we\nexperience in face-to-face settings\u2014these are sometimes termed \u2018water cooler encoun-\nters\u2019 (Herbsleb et al., 2002). However, there were also indications in some of the papers\nthat communications tools have not yet evolved enough to offer the richness of commu-\nnication that is required, suggesting that the way we currently use communication tools\nhas not evolved enough. Flanagan et al. (2004) suggested that tools are used for\n\u2018connecting not communicating\u2019\u2014the implication being that current technologies\nallow people to share information, and not the more complex levels of communication\nthat are possible in face-to-face interactions. However, there were examples given of\nhow technology could improve the student experience; for example, through the use\nof interactive classrooms as a means of engaging learners (McCabe & Lucas, 2004).\nDo we have the balance right between technology and practice?\nInterestingly, the sessions I attended did not generally address the question of\nwhether the balance between technology and practice is right. What emerged instead\nwas the close relationship between changes in technology and changes in practice.\nA number of presentations drew conclusions about the systemic use of technologies,\nreflecting on questions such as how can institutions and practitioners move from a\nsituation where technology is being used in a marginal way for experimentation to\nconsistent and widespread usage? Examples were given of where technology is now\nbeing used to support some of the core functions of institutions; virtual learning\nenvironments are the obvious example and, in fact, in contrast to presentations at\n234 S. Porter\nprevious ALT-C conferences, few presentations focused on their actual implementa-\ntion, which suggests that these technologies have now become so mainstream that\nthey are not worthy of much comment. Other presentations looked in some detail at\nspecific examples of technology becoming an integral part of learning, teaching and\nadministrative processes. Fitzgerald (2004), for example, examined how electronic\nsubmission of coursework is now a standard part of the processes of learning and\nteaching. This change has challenged a lot of current processes in ways that had not\npreviously been predicted. Although there is lot of enthusiasm from students and staff\nto use the new systems because they are perceived as being more efficient and effec-\ntive, these innovations (in both technology and practice) will ultimately lead to signif-\nicant changes to university systems and processes. This suggests that the introduction\nand use of a technology will always force new processes and practices and that the two\nthings (technology and practice\/processes) cannot be separated.\nThe ALT-C audience is largely made up of those who are trying to engage practi-\ncally with new technologies and processes and those who are concerned with support-\ning effective change. Several of the presentations reached thoughtful conclusions\nabout how to best manage the implementation of innovative technologies and shared\nsome good advice with their peers. One issue that was raised was that of scalability\u2014\ninnovations that are highly successful in small groups may not be effective when they\nare rolled out to large groups; the conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we\nneed to consider \u2018scaling up\u2019 issues when creating a plan for the introduction of a\ntechnology. Issues of scale may be affected by either the limitations of technology per\nse or by associated human and organisational issues. A further, slightly controversial,\npoint made was that practitioners may think that innovative technologies lose their\n\u2018fun\u2019 when they move from small-scale to large-scale implementation. To some extent\nthis suggests that one of the enablers for practitioners looking at the use of new tech-\nnologies is its \u2018novelty factor\u2019 rather than the improvement in quality or enhancement\nof the student learning experience that might result. However, this is perhaps more a\nquestion of the level of saturation of the technology within the learning process rather\nthan whether the technology is scaled up to widespread use. So a technology may still\nbe considered exciting if it is used by many students, but its use becomes mundane\nand routine when it is used across all aspects of a student\u2019s course.\nSome papers also pointed out that funding allocations and cost models will also\naffect the uptake of technologies. Planners should also be aware that some technolo-\ngies are both cost-effective and readily available\u2014in particular, technologies such as\nmobile phones, where there is almost 100% ownership by the student population\n(Traxler, 2004). Availability will affect how readily a solution based on that technol-\nogy can be rolled out.\nA further, more theoretical, theme that appeared in a number of sessions, related\nto the technological philosophy that underpins many of the current technologies. The\npoint was made several times that few technologies were designed explicitly for\neducational use. Examples include computers, telephones and Personal Digital Assis-\ntants. One of the most widely deployed \u2018educational\u2019 technologies, the Virtual Learn-\ning Environment or Learning Management System, is in reality little more than a\nRelationship between technology and practice 235\nslightly adapted content management system, where the educational use is \u2018bolted\non\u2019. This suggests that the technologies that are being promoted for use in education\nactually have a business rather than an educational focus. There was some debate in\nthe discussion session at the end of the conference about whether such adaptation of\ntechnology for a different purpose is necessarily a problem. Some felt that the funda-\nmental business philosophy that underpins some technologies, where the main driver\nis to increase information retention rather than understanding, might conflict with\nmore philosophical and moral educational ideals. However, the overall impression\ngained from the conference presentations was that people are adapting technology to\ndo what they want it to: interactive classroom technologies, for example, were not\ndesigned for educational use but are supremely well-suited to engaging learners in\nactive discourse and reflection. Jones (2004) spoke of \u2018technology appropriation\u2019, and\nthis supported the slightly subversive tone that represented the overall trend: educa-\ntionalists are using their knowledge and experience to get technology to do what they\nthink is appropriate.\nThere were also a number of papers that questioned the technical and philosophi-\ncal concepts that underpin some of the most widely used technologies. Presentations\nsuch as the Multi-user Online Dynamic Environment for Learning paper questioned\ncurrent technologies and underlying models upon which they depend (Brenton,\n2004). Other papers focused on practical issues, for example on how we adapt and\ndevelop current systems, and explored some of the current trends in technology that\nare receiving a lot of recognition at present. Morrison (2004) spoke of the service-\noriented approach to systems integration and information transfer that he suggested\nmight be the \u2018next big thing\u2019, a fact that is of central relevance to the current Joint\nInformation Systems Committee (JISC) e-Framework programme. Morrison\nsupported adoption of an approach based on a more flexible component-based\nsystem, rather than implementation of a complete, all in one, e-learning system.\nHowever, he did pose an important question about the timing of these developments,\nasking whether is it too soon or too late to begin to promote this approach, when\nmany universities are already committed to large, off-the-shelf systems.\nMany presentations acknowledged the fact that innovation is difficult and that\nintroducing a new technology to an organisation can cause many problems. A \u2018blue\nskies\u2019 technology cannot be easily introduced into existing closed and protected IT\nsystems that are prevalent in most institutions; there is an inherent resistance to such\nimplementation and support for technologies that are perceived to be untested and\npotentially risky. This is completely understandable; IT support services are put\nunder increasing pressure to provide streamlined, efficient and reliable services; many\nsupport services have to meet strict targets for service support. New technologies that\nstress these systems (or stress the staff who have to support their use) introduce addi-\ntional risk into an already overburdened organisational system. Many universities do\nnot have capacity to pay for the increased level of support needed to cope with this\nrisk. This leads to the conclusion that institutions may stifle innovation\u2014because\nthey do not have sufficient financial or human resources to support innovation. There\nis also the possibility that in some cases an institution (or some of the stakeholders\n236 S. Porter\nwithin the institution) may not wish to innovate; as it was put more bluntly in one\npresentation, \u2018innovation stops as soon as the administrators get involved\u2019 (Elliott,\n2004)\u2014although some might argue that this is an extreme and contestable statement.\nAny innovation that is to prove its value to practitioners has to move from being\ninnovative to becoming embedded into practice and into organisational processes.\nThis can be summarised as a cycle of adoption for innovation: \u2018From innovation to\nnormalisation\u2019. Several presentations referred to the iterative development cycle that\ntends to be followed during successful innovation. This was captured in some of the\nsessions in terms of the \u2018cycle of adoption\u2019 for technology. Several presenters referred\nto the fact that innovation occurs at many points in this cycle; and that it tends to be\ndriven by a specific problem that needs to be addressed, as well as the people (prac-\ntitioners, managers or support staff) who are willing to try something new to address\nthe problem.\nThere seems to be a further relationship between successful innovation and\nincreased use of technology leading to more embedded or systemic usage. In his\npresentation, Keefe (2004) highlighted that, for an innovative technology to be taken\nup to the point it needs to become embedded or systemic, the concept behind the\ninnovation needs to be proven. So it appears from the experiences recounted that the\nmore cutting edge or \u2018blue skies\u2019 technologies make demands on organisational\nsystems and processes, on cultural norms and practices, and on learning and teaching\npractices.\nThe conference sessions supported the well-elaborated discussion about how best\nto introduce change into an organisation. The importance of recognising the need for\nchange was echoed through many presentations. It was widely recognised that the\nintroduction of new and innovative technologies (and supporting processes) will\nrequire both planned and unplanned changes to occur. These changes will often need\nto take place in locations within the university system that are seemingly remote from\nthe technology; this makes the change requirements more difficult to predict. These\nthemes were further elaborated and explored during the open discussion session on\nthe final day of the conference, at which I drew together some of these conclusions.\nMany of the delegates at the conference are actively engaged in trying to move\ninnovative, experimental use of technology towards a state of being pervasive or\nsystemic. Participants identified some of the barriers to this change, focusing partic-\nularly on the problem of the lack of high-level support for innovatives and technology\nimplementation within institutions.\nKeefe (2004) drew upon his experience working for the University for Industry in\nsetting up the LearnDirect service, which has several million learners. His conclusion\nwas that the education sector is not generally good at making business cases and\nthinking through the implications of making a change, and that we could learn a lot\nfrom business environments or more delivery focused organisations such as LearnDi-\nrect in addressing difficult questions about why change is needed and what benefit it\nwill bring. Benefits may not necessarily be financial, but could be about an overall\nimprovement in quality, or increased student retention or satisfaction; whatever the\nbenefits, institutions need to be clearer about why they think a change is needed. This\nRelationship between technology and practice 237\nis particularly important when investment and support are needed from the senior\nmanagement; which is problematic given that senior management were frequently\ncited in the papers as being inherently conservative and change-averse.\nWe need also to be aware of what we may lose when introducing change\u2014not all\nchange is positive\u2014and this should be included in an analysis of the implications of\nintroducing new technologies into an institutional or organisational environment, and\nany business case for the introduction of new technologies should look at potential\nnegative as well as positive impacts. Senior managers are more likely to be influenced\nby a balanced argument than an unrealistically positive view.\nKeefe\u2019s points were contradicted to some extent in Morrison\u2019s presentation, where\nthere was a recognition that, internationally, some universities are becoming more\ncorporate, in part because they are responding to government imperatives for a more\nmarket-driven education system (Morrison referred to James Cornford\u2019s (2000)\npaper on the \u2018Virtual University\u2019).\nA further negative implication is that we may lose something when technology\nbecomes systemic. In the closing session, Sloep (2004) talked about the \u2018dullifying\u2019\nthat might be implied when technology becomes systemic; and warned that the sense\nof ownership and personalisation may be lost. This reiterates the point made earlier\nthat the motivational drive to using technology may be less effective if the technology\nis used across all aspects of the learning experiences. Thus, the introduction of any\nnew technology needs to consider the student experience as a whole, rather than\nfocusing upon discrete chunks of learning, and should attempt to create a balanced\npicture.\nA case study of application in practice\u2014the JISC approach\nIn light of the above review of the technological-related papers at the conference, this\nsection provides a summary of some of the ways in which one national funding body\nin this area, the JISC, is attempting to address many of the issues highlighted in the\nconference papers.\nFor the past 10 years, the JISC has stimulated innovations in both technology and\npractice. In the early 1990s, the JISC funded early experiments with Virtual Learning\nEnvironments, such as Colloquia and COSE, which are still considered to offer richer\nand more flexible environments for learning and communication than many widely\ndeployed learning environment systems. In parallel, the Electronic Libraries (or eLib)\nprogramme made significant strides in developing our understanding of digital librar-\nies. Many of the projects funded have gone on to form part of the (at the time) nascent\ninstitutional digital library, while others contributed to services that are still running,\nsuch as the Ariadne e-journal.\nThese early JISC programmes, which focused on innovation in technology, were\nfollowed by projects that considered both the technical and organisational\/cultural\nissues. For example, the Managed Learning Environment programme worked with\ninstitutions to explore the issues of integrating institutional systems and processes in\norder to support improved learning and teaching processes. What emerged was that\n238 S. Porter\nthe main barriers to integration were not technical but were, once again, cultural and\norganisational. The message from the Managed Learning Environment programme\nwas that change needs to be both top-down and bottom-up if it is to succeed and, as\nhas been iterated numerous times, change needs to be closely tied to institutional\nstrategy and imperatives\u2014even if, at times, the strategies need to be written and the\nimperatives identified by those attempting to achieve the change rather than senior\nmanagers.\nThese examples outline some of the approaches that the JISC has taken in order to\nstimulate innovation in both technological advances and in organisational and social\npractices. One of the desired outcomes is to help organisations make the most effective\nuse of technology that is appropriate to their own institutional goals. Activities like the\nManaged Learning Environment programme, which directly engage stakeholders at\nall levels within institutions in developing a strategic and integrated approach to the\nuse of technology to support learning and teaching and, to some extent, improved\nadministrative processes, help to achieve this goal. On one level, such programmes\nhelp institutions to develop and create a more knowledgeable workforce that is expe-\nrienced with planning and implementing innovations within a formal project manage-\nment structure, and ultimately to increase the capacity of the UK education sector to\nmanage innovation more effectively. On another level, the programmes provide\ndemonstrations of what can be achieved within an institution, if resources are made\navailable and if support and advice is provided. The programmes can provide exemplars\nof good practice or, at the very least, provide evidence of the problems encountered\nwhen trying to take a systemic approach to a particular technology.\nHowever, the JISC is aware of the limitations of its funding and that there will\nalways be a situation where some institutions will be more directly engaged in its\nactivities than others. In order to ensure that the \u2018sum of the whole is greater than the\nparts\u2019, programmes focus on specific themes, such as re-using learning objects or\nregional partnerships. This means that at times there may not always be a direct align-\nment with what is happening within institutions. The JISC is exploring different\napproaches to addressing this problem. We have already begun to address this issue\nthrough funding programmes such as the e-learning programme, which has several\ndifferent strands of activity, ranging from pedagogy and e-learning through to inno-\nvative technologies, in order to provide a range of possible points of interaction with\ndifferent groups. The programme also used an expert consultation group (derived\nfrom across the community), along with an actively edited web site that synthesised\nthe conclusions emerging from each of the strands into a coherent whole. Instead of\nfunding lengthy programmes of a single set of projects, the approach has been to fund\nshort-term projects in sets of cycles, where outcomes can be captured early and\nshared\u2014for example, through the \u2018Effective Practice in e-Learning\u2019 publication that\nwas published in 2004.\nWe want to develop these approaches further, looking at a range of methods to\nbetter engage the education community in the JISC\u2019s activity, so that our\nprogrammes can be more closely aligned with the most urgent priorities, as well as\npredicting the issues that will become important over the next five years.\nRelationship between technology and practice 239\nIn particular, the next year will focus on the issue of community engagement with\nJISC programmes through the development of the e-Framework. The primary goal\nof the initiative is to produce an evolving and sustainable, open standards-based\nservice-oriented technical framework to support the education and research commu-\nnities. Although the e-Framework can be conceived as a largely technical develop-\nment, the most important strand of activity that is being developed at present is the\nconcept of domain and reference models. The intention is to capture in a consistent\nformat the processes and functions that are commonly present in education and\nresearch, and use these to determine the activities that should be funded. The e-\nFramework is being designed to support research processes and administrative\nprocesses as well as learning and teaching, so the intention is that the mapping that\nwill be done will help to identify where there are common processes across the\ndomains and ensure that resources are being used effectively to share practices.\nThe ultimate goal is to better engage the community in prioritising the activities that\nthe JISC committees choose to fund; we hope that appropriate models for community\nengagement can help us to achieve this, and to help close the gap between innovation\nin technology and in practice.\nConclusions\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from the presentations and the final discussion\nsession at the conference is that, although the papers were in theory focused upon the\nmost ground-breaking and innovative uses of technology in education, the crux\npoints in most sessions were issues of organisational and cultural change. The most\nlively discussion topic in the closing session was around the subject of how we can\nachieve large-scale uptake of successful innovations within our organisations. The\nlearning technology community is already very sensitive to issues of organisation and\nculture, and is expert in bridging the gap between the technology and the practitioner.\nHowever, are we perhaps less expert in \u2018selling\u2019 our message? What are the benefits\nthat can be brought about by the introduction of changes in technology and practice?\nWhat are the risks and the costs? We need to get past these hurdles if we are to see\nsignificant adoption of learning technology in our institutions.\nDo we then have the balance right between innovation in technology and practice?\nThe conclusion here seemed to be that we cannot separate out innovation in technol-\nogy from innovation in practice, but, as a community, we need to become better at\nstimulating the right kind of innovation in both technology and practice.\nReferences\nBrenton, S.
