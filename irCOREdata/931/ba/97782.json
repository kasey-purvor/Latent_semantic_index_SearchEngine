In recent decades, seven out of twelve ice shelves\naround the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have either retreated\nsignificantly or have been almost entirely lost. At least some\nof these retreats have been shown to be unusual within the\ncontext of the Holocene and have been widely attributed to\nrecent atmospheric and oceanic changes. To date, measure-\nments of the area of ice shelves on the AP have either been\napproximated, or calculated for individual shelves over dis-\nsimilar time intervals. Here we present a new dataset contain-\ning up-to-date and consistent area calculations for each of the\ntwelve ice shelves on the AP over the past five decades. The\nresults reveal an overall reduction in total ice-shelf area by\nover 28 000 km2 since the beginning of the period. Individ-\nual ice shelves show different rates of retreat, ranging from\nslow but progressive retreat to abrupt collapse. We discuss\nthe pertinent features of each ice shelf and also broad spa-\ntial and temporal patterns in the timing and rate of retreat.\nWe believe that an understanding of this diversity and what it\nimplies about the underlying dynamics and control will pro-\nvide the best foundation for developing a reliable predictive\nskill for ice-shelf change.\n1 Introduction\nThe changing position of the margin of the Antarctic ice\nsheet, both floating and grounded, is currently being mapped\nas part of the USGS Coastal-change and Glaciological Maps\nof Antarctica programme (Williams and Ferrigno, 1998). As\npart of this programme, a comprehensive time-series of ice-\nfront changes around the Antarctic Peninsula was compiled\nfrom sources dating from 1940 to 2002 (Cook et al., 2005).\nThe time-series further reveal changes in glacier, ice shelf\nCorrespondence to: A. J. Cook\n(acook@bas.ac.uk)\nand other ice fronts and is published as hardcopy maps with\ndetailed accompanying reports (Ferrigno et al., 2006; Fer-\nrigno et al., 2008) and digital data (Scientific Committee\non Antarctic Research, 2005). The main trends observed in\nthe fronts of marine and tidewater glaciers of the Antarctic\nPeninsula have already been discussed elsewhere (Cook et\nal., 2005), but the changes in ice shelf fronts were excluded\nfrom that study and are brought up to date and described here.\nThe retreat of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula over\nthe past century has been widely documented and attributed\nto atmospheric warming (e.g., Vaughan and Doake, 1996;\nDoake and Vaughan, 1991a; Mercer, 1978; Rott et al., 1998;\nSkvarca et al., 1999) and several specific mechanisms have\nbeen suggested to explain particular phases of retreat and col-\nlapse (Scambos et al., 2000; Doake et al., 1998; MacAyeal\net al., 2003; Vieli et al., 2006). The role of atmospheric\nwarming as the primary driver of ice-shelf retreat is not, how-\never, a view that is universally accepted, with some evidence\nthat ice-shelf thinning may, in part, be the result of oceano-\ngraphic change which may \u201cpre-condition\u201d ice shelves to re-\ntreat (Shepherd et al., 2003). Thus the question remains as to\nwhether future ice-shelf change, not just around the Antarc-\ntic Peninsula, will be dominated by oceanographic or atmo-\nspheric drivers of change.\nGreater clarity has, however, been achieved with regard\nto another important question regarding ice-shelf retreat. It\nhas now been demonstrated quite clearly, that the loss of\nfloating ice shelves and ice in fjords can cause profound\nacceleration and thinning of the tributary glaciers flowing\nfrom the Antarctic Peninsula plateau (Rignot et al., 2004,\n2005; Rott et al., 2002; Scambos et al., 2003; Pritchard and\nVaughan, 2007; De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; Hulbe et al.,\n2008; Pritchard et al., 2009). Although rates of acceleration\nwill probably not persist indefinitely, it implies, and will al-\nmost certainly continue to imply, a contribution to sea-level\nrise. Although the effects of ice-shelf retreat on the tributary\nglaciers will not be extensively discussed in this paper, this is\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n78 A.

These data have\nbeen collected using a consistent methodology to give reli-\nable areas of each ice shelf over the past five decades. We\npresent an analysis of the changes and discuss the trends ob-\nserved.\n2 Method\nThe methods used in compiling the coastal-change database\nare described in detail elsewhere (Cook et al., 2005). In sum-\nmary, historical data sources, including early maps, aerial\nphotographs and satellite images, were used to map ice fronts\nonto a common reference, using ArcGIS. The quantity of\nsource material available varied considerably across the AP.\nIn some regions, photography coverage and satellite im-\nages allowed more than one coastline position to be mapped\nwithin each decade, whilst in other regions there was little or\nno coverage in some decades, and this implied large gaps be-\ntween recorded positions. The quality of the source material\n1http:\/\/www.polarview.org\/\nalso varied, so for this reason, each coastline digitised was\nassigned a reliability rating (Ferrigno et al., 2006). For the\npurpose of measuring how the ice shelves have changed in\narea over the last 50 years, one ice front position was chosen\nfor each decade. This coastline was chosen according to the\nfollowing scheme:\n\u2013 As close to mid-decade as possible.\n\u2013 Where this was not possible, a coastline at either the\nstart or end of the decade, depending on which has the\nmost complete, reliable ice front or most representative\nline.\n\u2013 Where there was no coastline available within the\ndecade, a coastline at the end of the previous decade\nas an approximate position.\n\u2013 Where none of the above information was available, the\ndecade remained blank.\nIt should be noted that the coastline chosen could have oc-\ncurred prior to or following a major ice-shelf collapse event\nand it has not been selected specifically to reflect these\nevents.\nThe resulting areas therefore represent the area of the ice\nshelf on a particular year, and do not represent an average po-\nsition for the decade. Accuracies cannot be assigned to each\narea value as the variation within each decade is not quan-\ntifiable using our data. The reliability rating attached to each\ncoastline indicates the likely errors in the positioning of the\nice front and should be taken into account when assessing the\naccuracy of the areas (Table 2). Since 87% of all coastlines\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 79\n(a) (b)\nFig. 1. (a) Location of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula (b) Contours of interpolated mean annual temperature in 2000 A.D., as\ncompiled by Morris and Vaughan (2003).\nare reliable to within 150 m, and because area accuracies de-\npend not only on variations in the width but also the length\nof the coastline, the areas are rounded to 1 km2 precision.\nUsing ArcGIS, the coastlines were joined to the grounding\nlines describing each ice shelf (obtained from the Antarctic\nDigital Database SCAR, 2005) to create a single polygon for\neach ice shelf, in each decade. The area of each polygon\nwas then measured, using a Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area\nprojection.\n3 Results\nOn the AP, the total area of ice shelf lost (from the earliest\navailable records to the present) is 28 117 km2 (Table 3). This\nis a total of 18% of the original area of floating ice (where\nthe \u201coriginal area\u201d is based on the earliest available areas for\neach ice shelf). Despite the episodic nature of the retreat\nof individual ice shelves, on the decadal timescale there has\nbeen a steady decline in total area of the Antarctic Penin-\nsula ice shelves that began in the 1970s and continued to the\npresent (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2. Total area of floating ice on the Antarctic Peninsula over the\npast 5 decades.\nThe largest change in ice lost from all ice shelves\ncombined, occurred between the 1970s and 1980s (from\n1621 km2 ice gain in the previous decade, to 9823 km2 ice\nloss), with a slight decline in ice loss since the 1980s from\n7640 km2 to 5461 km2 lost within the present decade (Fig. 3).\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010\n80 A.

Of the twelve ice shelves, three have shown signifi-\ncant retreat (Larsen B, Mu\u00a8ller and Wilkins) and four of them\nhave shown total disintegration (Jones, Wordie, Prince Gus-\ntav, Larsen A) within the last half-century (Table 2). The\ndefinition of significant retreat we use here is where less than\n70% of the original ice shelf area remains; total disintegra-\ntion is where 10% or less of the original area remains.\nFive of the ice shelves (George VI, Bach, Stange, Larsen C\nand Larsen D) have more than 90% of their original area re-\nmaining and are showing no steady retreat. Larsen D is the\nonly ice shelf to have shown overall advance over this time\nperiod. The largest ice shelf, Larsen C, is still the largest\ncontributor to the overall remaining ice-shelf area, and is cur-\nrently at approximately 90% of its original area and shows no\nsignificant areal change.\nIt has been proposed that the thermal limit of viability\nfor ice shelves on the AP is north of the \u22129 \u25e6C isotherm\n(Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Morris and Vaughan, 2003) and\nour results largely corroborate this theory as all five unchang-\ning ice shelves lie south of the \u22129 \u25e6C isotherm (in 2000)\nFig. 3. Total amount of floating ice lost between each decade\n(see Fig. 1b). As the following descriptions indicate, the\nice shelves that have retreated have generally followed a pat-\ntern that suggests a southerly migration of a climatic limit.\nThe Wilkins Ice Shelf is the latest and southernmost ice shelf\nto begin collapse, suggesting that the thermal boundary has\ncontinued to move southwards and may soon threaten the\ncurrently stable ice shelves on the southwest AP.\n4 Description of change on individual ice shelves\nDespite the overall trend of retreat of ice shelves around the\nAP, individual ice shelves have shown considerable differ-\nences in the timing and course of their retreat. Our expecta-\ntion is that these variations result from the particular charac-\nteristics of both the local forcing experienced by individual\nice shelves and their internal dynamics and specifics of their\nmass balance. Indeed, the ice shelves of the AP are diverse\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G.

It is also\nclear that changes such as thinning, increases in tributary\nflow and rheological weakening must be considered along-\nside ice front retreat if we are to correctly interpret the type\nof collapse shown by individual ice shelves.\nSo while the changes seen in each ice shelf may be broadly\ninterpreted through discussion of these factors, as is under-\ntaken below, it is clear that a formal sensitivity analysis us-\ning models that can take account of differences in mass bal-\nance sensitivity and ice rheology, similar to those performed\nfor Larsen B (Vieli et al., 2007), are the most powerful tool\navailable in understanding the detailed aspects of the course\nof change. Similarly, the \u201cstructural glaciology\u201d approach\nbased on a detailed examination of individual retreat events\n(Glasser and Scambos, 2008; Braun and Humbert, 2009) can\nprovide greater insight into particular retreat events than can\nbe presented here.\nThe description of each ice shelf that follows provides a\ndiscussion of the changes in areas measured for this study,\nand an overview of published research that has discussed\nprocesses important during retreat. It should be noted that\nthe areas calculated here may differ from those that appeared\nin earlier studies (i.e. those listed in Table 1) for several rea-\nsons: interpretations of grounding line positions may differ,\nas may the images from which the ice front positions were\nmeasured; the methods and accuracy of digitising is not con-\nsistent between studies and neither is the approach to whether\ninternal ice rises and rumples should be included in the area\nof the ice shelf. The map projection on which the areas were\ncalculated can also make a significant difference.\n4.1 West coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, north to\nsouth\n4.1.1 Mu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.1)\nMu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf (67\u25e614\u2032 S and 66\u25e652\u2032 W) is one of the small-\nest remaining ice shelves, currently covering 40 km2. It is\nthe northernmost ice shelf on the western side of the AP and\ndrains an area of the Arrowsmith Peninsula. Two glaciers\nfeed the ice shelf (Bruckner and Antevs), which is pinned on\nHumphreys Island. Aerial photography from 1947 revealed\na significant advance beyond the island until 1956 (Ward,\n1995), after which retreat began and by 1963 it was almost\nback to its 1947 position. A second period of ice front ad-\nvance of 4 km2 took place between 1974 and 1986. This was\nfollowed by retreat until 1996, after which it has been rela-\ntively stable. It is currently at approximately 50% of its size\nin 1957, although a lack of ground surveying makes interpre-\ntation of the grounding line difficult.\nA longer historic context for Mu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf, obtained\nfrom marine sediment cores, shows that advance took place\nca. 400 years ago (Domack et al., 1995). Although this cor-\nrelates with the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA), climatic\nconditions across Antarctica were variable and this period\nwas one of warmer temperatures along the AP. Domack et\nal. (1995) concluded that the advance at this time was prob-\nably linked to colder circumpolar deep water (CDW) filling\nthe fjord than at present. The warm CDW that is currently\nwithin the fjord may be contributing to the rapid undermelt\nof the ice-shelf system observed in recent years. However,\nwith 50% of the ice shelf remaining and little change in area\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010\n82 A. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves\nFig. 4.1. Mu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf\nsince the 1990s, the question remains, why does so much of\nMu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf remain today, when neighbouring Jones Ice\nShelf (Fig. 1a) is entirely gone? Swithinbank (1986) sug-\ngested that without the protection afforded by the fjord em-\nbayment Mu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf probably would not exist under\npresent climatic conditions. This could offer some of the\nanswer, but it might also be wise to question how much of\nthe remaining portion of Mu\u00a8ller Ice Shelf is actually floating.\nThe photograph shown in Fig. 4.1 seems to show that only\nthe western ice front as a clear calving front and it is possible\nthat east of Humphreys Island, the ice is more ice plain than\nice shelf. However, with water depths immediately adjacent\nto the ice shelf reaching over 600 m (Domack et al., 1995)\nthis would seem to imply a surprising bed topography.\n4.1.2 Jones Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.2)\n(For a description of the full coastal-change time series for\nJones Ice Shelf see Ferrigno, et al., 2006, p. 8; Fox and\nVaughan, 2005). Jones Ice Shelf (67\u25e630\u2032 S and 66\u25e655\u2032 W)\nfilled Jones Channel between Bigourdan Fjord and Bour-\ngeois Fjord, and was fed mainly by the 10-km long Heim\nGlacier on Arrowsmith Peninsula. Although substantially\nsmaller than most (29 km2 in 1947), it has shown a similar\npattern of retreat to other ice shelves on the Antarctic Penin-\nsula. Including records prior to the 1950s, the imagery re-\nveals there was a slight increase in area between 1947 and\n1978, since when it began a rapid retreat, culminating in\ncomplete disappearance by 2003. Blaicklock Island and the\nArrowsmith Peninsula are now separated by open water in\nJones Channel.\nHowever, despite being less than ten kilometres apart and\nunder similar climate forcing, the east and west portions of\nthe ice shelf behaved differently, with most of the early ad-\nvance and subsequent retreat occurring on the eastern ice\nfront. The western front was stable until the early 1990s,\nafter which it too retreated, disconnecting from Blaicklock\nIsland sometime between December 1998 and January 2001.\nThe difference in response between the two ice fronts was\nexamined by Fox and Vaughan (2005). Their conclusion was\nthat the response of the east and west fronts of the ice shelf\nwere controlled by the configuration of the fjord in which\nthe ice shelf lay. They also concluded that the western and\neastern portions of Jones Ice Shelf lie in convergent and di-\nvergent embayments respectively, and therefore had different\nstrain rate regimes, which affected the retreat rates. This sup-\nports modelling studies (Doake et al., 1998) which compared\ncontrasting ice flow regimes in the Larsen B Ice Shelf prior\nto its collapse. The course of retreat therefore, appears to be\ncontrolled not only by climatic events but also, in this case,\nthe geometry of the embayment and the presence of a small\nice rise that acted as a pinning point on the western side (Fox\nand Vaughan, 2005).\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA.

Jones Ice Shelf\nIce-shelf thickness does not appear to have had a strong\ninfluence on the progress of the retreat (Fox and Vaughan,\n2005). There is, however, insufficient evidence to determine\nwhether surface-melting may be related to specific retreat\nevents (Scambos et al., 2000).\n4.1.3 Wordie Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.3)\n(For a description of the full coastal-change time series for\nWordie Ice Shelf see Ferrigno, et al., 2006, 8).

Understanding\nthe cause and mechanism of collapse has yielded important\nclues as to the behaviour of ice shelves as they undergo pro-\ngressive ice front retreat.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010\n84 A. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves\nDuring the British Graham Land Expedition (1934\u20131937),\nthe early explorers identified approximately ten ice rises or\nice rumples. The ice shelf was then interpreted as a relict\nfeature and because of poor surface conditions it was sug-\ngested that it would not survive for long (Fleming, 1940).\nDoake and Vaughan (1991b) suggested that the break-\nup was triggered by the warming trend in mean annual air\ntemperatures in this region since the early 1970s, which in-\ncreased ablation and the amount of melt-water. In particular\nthey briefly suggested that an increased prevalence of melt-\nwater could either reduce fracture toughness of the ice shelf,\nor increase water pressure at the base of crevasses and al-\nlow them to grow into rifts; either of these processes, they\nsuggested, could have increased the calving rate and caused\nthe ice shelf to retreat. They also suggested that the major\nice rises appeared to have played a significant role in con-\ntrolling the retreat of Wordie Ice Shelf. The earlier ice front\nretreat was punctuated by periods of stasis when the ice was\npinned on the ice rises (Vaughan, 1993), and the retreat be-\ntween periods of stasis was rapid. The ice rises also appear\nto have acted as wedges, contributing to weakening of the\nice shelf and hastening the break-up. As the shelf ice flowed\npast them, the ice rises caused splitting of the ice shelf up-\nstream, and created broken wakes downstream, introducing\nweakness (see oblique aerial photograph in Fig. 4.3). The in-\ncreasing stresses caused by the separation around the ice rise\nas the ice shelf accelerated eventually became sufficient for\nfracture. Fracture, in the form of surface crevasses or rifts\nextending to the bottom of the ice shelf, appeared prior to re-\ntreat of the ice front, but whether this was a cause or effect of\nthe collapse remains unclear.\nWordie Ice Shelf was fed by a number of tributary glaciers\nwhich join to make three main input units. As the fracture\nprocesses weakened the interior of the ice shelf, and after the\nice front had retreated past a critical point, the outlet glaciers\nappeared to punch through the remaining ice shelf because of\nthe reduced restraint on them (Vaughan et al., 1993). How-\never, the break-up of the ice shelf was not initiated by surging\nactivity on the input glaciers.\nVaughan (1993) also concluded that there were no changes\nin the relative dominance of the tributary glaciers (between\n8 to 20 km upstream) following the ice-shelf collapse and\ntherefore the ice shelf provided no significant restraint on the\ninland glaciers. Given recent work, however, this conclusion\nis now in doubt. The impact of the loss of the ice shelf has\nbeen observed upstream on Fleming Glacier (Rignot et al.,\n2005). Satellite radar interferometry data from 1995 to 2004\nand airborne ice thickness data from 2002 reveal that 50 km\nfrom its ice front, Fleming Glacier flows 50 percent faster\nthan it did in 1974, prior to the main collapse of the Wordie\nIce Shelf. Rignot et al. (2005) conclude that the glaciers ac-\ncelerated following ice-shelf removal and have been thinning\nand losing mass to the ocean over the last decade.\n4.1.4 George VI Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.4)\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf on the west coast\nof the AP, covering a total area of \u223c 24000 km2. It is unusual\nin two respects, as discussed in Smith et al., 2007. Firstly,\nit has two ice fronts that are almost 500 km apart and expe-\nrience quite different climatic conditions. Secondly, it is an\nice shelf that is constrained within a narrow channel (25 km\nwide in the north, widening to over 70 km in the south) and\nloses most of its mass to melting (both surface melt-pools and\nbasal melting), rather than changes in ice-dynamics brought\nabout by a changing calving rate (Roberts et al., 2005).This\nsuggests that this ice shelf may be more sensitive to changes\nin ocean conditions, and less sensitive than its neighbours to\natmospheric change (Doake and Vaughan, 1991b).\nBoth the north and south ice fronts have shown retreat in\nrecent decades but the overall area has not shown significant\nchange, currently at 92% of its original size (in 1947). Al-\nthough the relative change is small, it has been argued that\nit may be in its first stage of disintegration (Luchitta and\nRosanova, 1998).\nThe northern front (at 70\u25e6 S, 68\u25e645\u2032 W) showed a short pe-\nriod of advance between 1947 and 1960, followed by a major\nphase of ice-shelf retreat until 1980, then slower but contin-\nual retreat through to the present day. A total of 610 km2 of\nice has been lost since 1947. It is thought that calving occurs\nalong rifts and fissures which penetrate the entire depth of\nthe ice shelf (approximately 100 m at the northern ice front)\n(Potter and Paren, 1985). Conversely, it is thought that calv-\ning here has, at least in the past, been affected by the occur-\nrence of perennial and on occasion, semi-permanent sea-ice,\nwhich may prevent calving of ice when cracks form near the\nedge, and holds large icebergs within the channel for years.\nModelling studies of Humbert (2007) showed that the stress\nregime along the northern ice front is very different from the\none at the southern end. Doake (1982) commented that it\nwas difficult to locate the true ice shelf front in images be-\ncause of the fragmented shelf. Indeed, interpretations of the\nice front from imagery in 1974 in this study differ from those\nby Luchitta (1998).\nThe southern front (at 73\u25e6 S, 72\u25e610\u2032 W) has shown a reg-\nular rate of retreat since 1947, although retreat has slowed\nsince the 1990s. It has lost a total of 1330 km2 since 1947,\nmore than twice the area of that lost from the northern front.\nIt also appears to have begun retreating earlier, without any\nsignificant re-advance. Here the ice shelf is significantly\nthicker (a maximum of 600 m) and wider (over 70 km) than at\nthe northern front (Smith et al., 2007). There is little sea-ice\nbuild-up within the Ronne Entrance which also differs from\nthe northern end of George VI Sound.\nAn unusual abundance of annual melt ponds on parts of\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf has been known, at least since the 1960s\n(Wager, 1972). In recent decades, every summer much of the\nsouthern part of the ice shelf has been covered in melt-ponds\nthat tend to recur on the same area of ice each year. This is\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 85\nFig. 4.4.

Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves\nclear evidence that the presence of persistent melt does not\nnecessarily condemn an ice shelf to rapid retreat, and cannot\nbe considered the sole factor in causing ice-shelf retreat. Ex-\ntensive surface melting in the summer season may be trig-\ngered by loose sedimentary rock particles that are blown\nonto the ice surface from the surrounding mountains (Wager,\n1972; Ridley, 1993). There is one major factor, however, that\nis likely to be responsible both for the persistence of melt-\nponding on George VI Ice Shelf and its continued survival.\nMost of the ice in George VI Ice Shelf derives from glaciers\nfeeding it from the Antarctic Peninsula in the east. Most of\nthis ice flows towards Alexander Island to the west (Pearson\nand Rose, 1983), creating strong uniaxial compression over\nlarge portions of the ice shelf. Being in compression means\nthat there are few crevasses in the ice shelf, and these, and\nany other routes by which water can drain down out of the\nice shelf, are quickly closed. Melt water thus tends to remain\nat the surface of this ice shelf much longer than is normal. In\nthe absence of extensional strain, surface ponding appears to\nbe insufficient to cause fracturing.\nThe overall pattern of retreat of both ice fronts coincides\nwith the well-documented atmospheric warming across the\nAP, but since the southern ice front retreat preceded retreat at\nthe northern ice front, it cannot be interpreted simply as a re-\nsult of the southern migration of a key mean annual isotherm\n(Smith et al., 2007). It is likely that the southern ice front is\nalso responding to other forcing mechanisms and feedbacks\n(e.g. changes in sea-ice extent or oceanography). One theory\nis that the mass balance of the ice shelf is strongly influenced\nby high basal melt rates associated with intrusions of warm\nUpper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) (Shepherd et al.,\n2003; Payne et al., 2004) and therefore its stability is sensi-\ntive to changes in ocean circulation. The thinning of float-\ning glaciers in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) region\nhas been attributed to heat contained within the CDW flow-\ning towards the continent via a submarine glacial trough and\ndriving basal melting (Walker et al., 2007). In order to assess\nwhether George VI Ice Shelf has entered a phase of rapid re-\ntreat and whether this is largely driven by atmospheric warm-\ning, basal melting, or both, requires further work (Smith et\nal., 2007).\n4.1.5 Wilkins Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.5)\n(For a description of a coastal-change time series for Wilkins\nIce Shelf over the past 15 years, see Braun, et al., 2009).\nWilkins Ice Shelf (70\u25e620\u2032 S, 72\u25e620\u2032 W) is the largest ice\nshelf on West Antarctica currently undergoing significant\nbreak-up. There is little data available between 1947 and\nmid-1980s, but the earliest retreat was noted by Braun et\nal. (2009) to have occurred in 1991. As with the Larsen A\nand Larsen B Ice Shelves (see 4.2.2), the retreat events were\ncharacterized by episodic calving of many small elongated\nicebergs. A break-up event was observed in 1998 (Scambos\net al., 2000) but much of the ice remained until March, and\nFig. 4.5. Wilkins Ice Shelf\nagain in July, 2008, when dramatic calving occurred. The\nice shelf was then only supported by a single strip of ice just\n1 km wide, strung between Latady and Charcot islands. This\nstrip gave way in April 2009, reducing the overall area to\n5434 km2, less than two thirds of the original area. This num-\nber is that measured for this study and at that particular time\nfor an ice shelf that is constantly evolving: other studies have\ngiven a more detailed description of the area changes that\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 87\nhave occurred over the past few years (e.g. Braun and Hum-\nbert (2009), Humbert and Braun (2008), Braun et al. (2009)\nand Scambos et al., 2009).\nWilkins Ice Shelf has an unusual mass balance regime and\ndiffers in many ways from its neighbours, Wordie Ice Shelf\nand George VI Ice Shelf, which are fed by glaciers. It is un-\nusually stagnant with interior flow rates of 30\u201390 ma\u22121, com-\npared to Wordie (typically, 200\u20132000 ma\u22121) and George VI\n(typically, < 200 ma\u22121) (Vaughan et al., 1993). The catch-\nment area is approximately 16 900 km2, which is an unusu-\nally low proportion of grounded ice sustaining the ice shelf,\ncompared with Wordie Ice Shelf and George VI Ice Shelf.\nIn this respect it may be similar to Larsen A Ice Shelf in be-\ning sustained largely by in situ accumulation. Vaughan et\nal. (1993) also found that in the middle of the ice shelf the\nsurface was low, but there is a topographic bulge along the\nshelf\u2019s western margins, where most of the accumulation ap-\npeared to occur. Abundant melt-ponding and the observation\nthat the ice shelf was unusually thin and parts may be brine-\nsoaked to sea-level (Vaughan et al., 1993; Swithinbank and\nLuchitta, 1986), suggested that the shelf may be subject to\nrapid break-up (Lucchitta and Rosanova, 1998). Vaughan et\nal. (1993) however, stated that Wilkins Ice Shelf front was\nlikely to decay by normal calving processes and unlikely to\nundergo sudden disintegration (as seen in the Wordie Ice\nShelf), at least until the calving front decoupled from the\nfringing islands. They speculated that if the climatic limit\ncontinued to move south at the same rate, within 30 years the\nWilkins Ice Shelf may no longer be viable.\nAnalysis of the recent break-up suggested that surface or\nnear-surface melt-water was the main pre-condition for disin-\ntegration, and that the opening of crevasses by the pressure of\nincreasing volumes of melt-water, so-called hydro-fracture,\nwas an important mechanism (Scambos et al., 2009). In parts\nof the ice shelf where extensional stresses were already high,\nhydro-fracture would have favoured the opening of crevasses\nuntil they eventually became rifts. Scambos et al. noted that\nthe break-ups were characterized by repeated rapid fracturing\nthat created narrow parallel blocks at the ice-edge, where ice-\nfront bending stresses induced by buoyancy forces were re-\nsponsible for fracture formation. Braun et al. (2009) showed\nthat stresses in Wilkins Ice Shelf changed with each major\ndisintegration event, resulting in lengthening of rifts imme-\ndiately following the events. These changes in stress dis-\ntribution, together with widespread brine infiltration, led to\nthe May 2008 disintegration event (Scambos et al., 2009).\nIt has also been inferred that compressive stress along the\nnarrow ice bridge between Charcot and Latady Islands in-\ncreased as this region narrowed. Near-surface melt-water is\neffective at driving fracture extension and it has been con-\ncluded that most disintegration events will occur during or\njust after an extensive melt season. The two break-ups that\noccurred during Autumn\/Winter seasons, however, showed\nthat melt ponds played no role in these particular break-up\nprocesses (Braun and Humbert, 2009). The fact that Wilkins\nIce Shelf experienced two break-up events under two widely\ncontrasting surface conditions reveals that there is more than\none mechanism at play in its disintegration. Prediction of\nwhere and when the next step in the break-up might occur\nis impossible due to this highly complex pattern of fractur-\ning, and close observation of subsequent events by satellite is\nkey to examining the causes and triggers of break-up events\n(Humbert and Braun, 2008). Latest research (carried out in\nFebruary 2009) suggests that about 3100 km2 at the northern\nWilkins Ice Shelf are endangered, but that there is no visible\nsignature that the remaining 8000 km2 are at risk (Braun et\nal., 2009).\nIn addition to climatic forcing (i.e. the migration south-\nwards of the thermal limit of viability), the Wilkins Ice Shelf\nis subject to the same oceanic forcing mechanism as George\nVI Ice Shelf as it receives the same warm-water influx of\nthe UCDW current. The major decrease in sea-ice extent\nobserved in the Bellinghausen Sea from 1988 through 1991\nmay also have affected the ice-shelf margin, although this\nremains to be explored (Lucchitta and Rosanova, 1998).\n4.1.6 Other ice shelves on west Antarctic Peninsula\n(Fig. 4.6 and 4.7)\nThere are two other substantial ice shelves located on the\nwestern side of the Antarctic Peninsula: Bach Ice Shelf, lo-\ncated between Beethoven Peninsula and Monteverdi Penin-\nsula, at the southern end of Alexander Island, and Stange\nIce Shelf, west of Spaatz Island. There are also a number of\nsmall un-named ice shelves close to the Wilkins Ice Shelf, on\nBeethoven Peninsula, which are not discussed in this report.\nAlthough Bach Ice Shelf and Stange Ice Shelf are named\nand are considerably larger than other ice shelves on the\nAP (namely: Jones, Mu\u00a8ller, Wordie, Prince Gustav and\nLarsen A), there has to date been very little discussion about\neither. There has been much greater interest paid to their\nneighbours, Wilkins Ice Shelf and George VI Ice Shelf.\nThey should be considered, however in studies of ice-shelf\nbehaviour in this region, as they both display relative stabil-\nity in an area that may be subject to both atmospheric and\noceanic forcing. Bach Ice Shelf (72\u25e6 S, 72\u25e620\u2032 W) lies be-\ntween Wilkins Ice Shelf and George VI Ice Shelf southern\nice front, both of which have shown significant retreat in re-\ncent years. Its area was 4800 km2 in 1947 and since then\nit has lost only 300 km2, showing a cycle of steady growth\nand intermittent calving retreat during this period. Stange\nIce Shelf (73\u25e6 S, 76\u25e640\u2032 W), situated to the west of George\nVI Ice Shelf, also shows no signs of retreat. At 8300 km2\nin 1970s (there are no reliable records of the ice front po-\nsition prior to 1973), it is currently at 8000 km2, or 96% of\nits original size. It can be concluded that both Stange and\nBach Ice Shelves show stable ice-shelf behaviour.

Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 89\nFig. 4.8. Prince Gustav Ice Shelf\nThere is some evidence that Prince Gustav Ice Shelf was\nalready retreating prior to 1957, the first position recorded\nfor this study. Historical accounts as far back as 1843 sug-\ngest that the ice shelf had been retreating for most of this\nperiod (Cooper, 1997). A study by Reece (1949), based on\nexpedition reports, showed that in 1945 the southern ice front\nstretched from James Ross Island as far south as Robertson\nIsland. He concluded that at this time the ice was continu-\nous with Larsen Ice Shelf. He discussed the difference in the\ntypes of ice observed in the Prince Gustav Channel: \u201c(The\nice to the north of Sjo\u00a8gren Glacier) is land-fast sea ice, which\npersists for more than one season due to the presence of is-\nlands; that in the south is shelf ice of the same type and origin\nas the Larsen Ice Shelf but perhaps less thick. This is mainly\ndue to the presence of shoals although islands are also there.\u201d\nThere is evidence to suggest that the ice shelf became sepa-\nrated from Larsen Ice Shelf sometime in the late 1940s (Fran-\ncis, 1947), retreating to Cape Longing. Since then there was\na rapid retreat from 1957 to 1961, followed by a more steady\nretreat until the collapse in 1995.\nAs with Jones Ice Shelf, the response of the ice fronts at\neach side of the channel differed considerably. The northern\nice front was relatively stable until the early 1990s, but the\nsouthern ice front has shown a slow progressive retreat since\nthe earliest records. The mechanisms underlying the retreat\nwere discussed by Cooper (1997). The ice of the Prince Gus-\ntav Channel has two components: glacier tongues (flowing\ninto the northern part of Prince Gustav Ice Shelf) and ice de-\nrived from in situ accumulation (south of Sjo\u00a8gren Glacier).\nThe different geometries may also explain the differing sta-\nbility of the northern and southern margins: in the north, the\nland margins are convergent and the ice margin is pinned at\nthe narrows between Cape Obelisk and the opposite shore;\nin the south the land margins are broadly divergent, allowing\nthe ice to retreat steadily along a featureless coast (Cooper,\n1997). The geometry of the southern coast has changed due\nto the significant retreat of Sjo\u00a8gren Glacier, making it un-\nlikely that the ice shelf will reform.\nOne study of sub-ice-shelf sediments has demonstrated\nthat Prince Gustav Ice Shelf varied in extent in response to\nnatural Holocene climate forcing (Pudsey and Evans, 2001).\nThis study concluded that ice shelves in this region are sen-\nsitive indicators of regional climate change, but without nec-\nessarily implying that recent decay is due to human-induced\nclimate change (Pudsey and Evans, 2001).\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010\n90 A.

For Larsen\nB see Ferrigno et al., 2008, 8. For a detailed analysis of\nLarsen Ice Shelf changes in extent between 1840 and 1960,\nsee Karstkarel, 2005). Close to the Prince Gustav Ice Shelf,\nthe Larsen A Ice Shelf (64\u25e640\u2032 S, 60\u25e6 W) has also disap-\npeared. Larsen A Ice Shelf extended from Cape Longing\nto Robertson Island and merged with Larsen B Ice Shelf to\nthe south at Seal Nunataks. At 4000 km2 in 1961, Larsen A\nremained relatively stable until the 1980s, when it began to\nretreat in steps, culminating in January and February 1995\nin a major collapse. During this period, almost 2000 km2 of\nice shelf were lost within a few weeks, breaking up into thou-\nsands of icebergs producing a plume 200 km into the Weddell\nSea. This breakup was the most spectacular event of ice-shelf\nretreat along both coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula until that\ntime, and was the first collapse that was properly observed\n(Rott et al., 1996, 1998). The ice within Larsen Inlet (be-\ntween Cape Longing and Sobral Peninsula) also continued to\nretreat after it became disconnected from Larsen A Ice Shelf,\nsuffering major retreat during the period 1987 to 1989, and\nvery little ice remains. What does remain is a small promon-\ntory held together by Seal Nunataks, which may or may not\nbe floating.\nThe same form of collapse occurred on an even larger scale\nin 2002 with the break-up of Larsen B Ice Shelf. Larsen B\n(65\u25e630\u2032 S, 61\u25e6 W) is the ice shelf south of Larsen A, extend-\ning from Robertson Island in the north to Jason Peninsula\nin the south. In 1963, it was 12 000 km2 but now has only\n20% of its area remaining (2400 km2). Most of the remain-\ning ice is held in Scar Inlet, between Cape Disappointment\nand Jason Peninsula. Unlike Larsen A, Larsen B contin-\nued to advance until the early 1990s. A large tabular ice-\nberg (\u223c 1700 km2) and smaller icebergs calved in 1995, after\nwhich it followed a similar pattern of retreat to its neighbour\nLarsen A (Scambos et al., 2000). It culminated in a dramatic\nfragmentation of approximately 3250 km2 within only a few\ndays in February 2002. This was the first ice shelf for which\ngood data was collected prior to retreat, assisting with under-\nstanding the controls of the dynamics of ice shelves.\nThe potential mechanisms leading to the disintegration of\nthese ice shelves have been widely discussed. The underly-\ning cause appears to be rising atmospheric temperatures in\nthe region (Rott et al., 2002, 1998; Vaughan et al., 2001;\nSkvarca et al., 1998; Domack et al., 2005), but while this\nmay be the principal driver, it does not explain the mecha-\nnism behind dramatic collapse rather than normal progres-\nsive retreat.\n2There are four glaciological distinct sections of the feature\nthat is formally named \u201cLarsen Ice Shelf\u201d, these have been termed\nLarsen A, Larsen B, Larsen C and Larsen D following nomenclature\nproposed by Vaughan and Doake, 1996. See Fig. 1a.\nBoth ice shelves were observed to have significant melt-\nwater accumulation, both immediately prior to and in pre-\nceding melt-seasons. One theory is that the build-up of sur-\nface melt-water causes initial fragmentation of the ice shelf\nby downward propagation of water through crevasses (Scam-\nbos et al., 2000, 2008; van der Veen, 2007; van den Broeke,\n2005). The rapid disintegration of the rifted shelves into\nthousands of small fragments could be explained by a sec-\nondary process proposed by MacAyeal et al. (2003). This\ninvolves energy being released when narrow ice-shelf frag-\nments capsize in a coherent manner, which then initiate fur-\nther fragmentation in a \u201cdomino\u201d effect. This mechanism\ncould also help explain the time delay between previous sea-\nsons of greatest melt-water build-up and the season of rapid\ncollapse. The pre-break-up surface texture and ice thick-\nness, which are related to the glacier source areas, are also\ncritical in determining the speed of ice-shelf disintegration\n(MacAyeal et al., 2003).\nAnother theory, supported by numerical modelling of the\nchanging stress regime during the collapse of Larsen A\n(Doake et al., 1999), suggests that the geometry of the ice\nfront could be extremely significant in initiating disintegra-\ntion. The theory holds that an ice front may be kept stable\nonly so long as there remains an arch of horizontal uniaxial\ncompression that bridges the pinning points on the ice front.\nThe arch of compression in the ice shelf are similar to the\nvertical-plane forces that maintain the arch of a stone bridge;\nhere the lower stones are held in compression, but if too many\nstones fall away from the underside and the arch is breached\nthe bridge will inevitably collapse. Similarly, in an ice shelf,\nso long as the second principal stress (perpendicular to the\nice front) is compressive the ice front can remain stable, but\nwhen calving causes the geometry to bow inwards and re-\nmoves sufficient ice from this compressive arch (Doake et al.,\n1998; Rack et al., 2000), the ice shelf front could become po-\ntentially unstable. Under these conditions irreversible retreat\nwill occur, possibly catastrophically (Doake et al., 1998). On\nLarsen B Ice Shelf, large rifts, almost parallel to the ice front,\nformed lines of weakness along which calving occurred in\nthe years prior to collapse (Skvarca, 1993). These transverse\ncompression fractures differ from the linear fractures that ap-\npeared in Wilkins Ice Shelf prior to collapse, suggesting there\nis a difference in calving mechanisms.\nAnother hypothesis has been used to suggest that the ice\nshelves may have become susceptible to crevasse-fracture\nthrough a sustained ice thinning (Shepherd et al., 2003).\nSatellite altimetry has shown that Larsen B Ice Shelf low-\nered by up to 0.17\u00b1 0.11 ma\u22121 between 1992 and 2001,\nwhich could be explained not only by increased summer\nmelt-water changing the near surface density structure, but\nthe loss of basal ice through melting (Shepherd et al.,\n2003). This suggests that enhanced ocean-driven melting\ncould provide a link between regional climate warming and\nsuccessive disintegration of these sections of the Larsen Ice\nShelf. Oceanographic observations in this region are limited,\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G.

Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves\nhowever, and another study has shown that regional ocean\nwarming may not have had a major impact on basal melt rates\n(Nicholls et al., 2004).\nOther changes in the ice-shelf dynamics prior to their col-\nlapse have also been detected, such as an acceleration in ice-\nshelf flow of up to 50%, revealed through observations using\nsatellite radar interferometry for the Larsen B Ice Shelf (Rig-\nnot et al., 2004; Vieli et al., 2006; Skvarca et al., 2003). It has\nbeen speculated that the ice-shelf acceleration is explained\nby the retreat of the ice front but also by further rheologi-\ncal weakening of the shear margins, and not by the observed\nthinning or the acceleration of tributary glaciers (which ap-\npear to be an effect, not a cause of ice-shelf acceleration)\n(Vieli et al., 2007; Khazendar et al., 2007). Ice surface fea-\ntures were examined by Glasser and Scambos (2008), who\nconcluded that structural glaciological discontinuities played\na large part in the break-up of the Larsen B Ice Shelf be-\ncause they rendered the ice shelf mechanically weak prior to\nits collapse. Large open-rift systems, which were not present\nmore than \u223c 20 years ago, became more pronounced in the\nyears preceding break-up, possibly as a result of ice-shelf\nfront retreat during 1998\u20132000 which removed the strongest\nportions of shelf ice (Glasser and Scambos, 2008).\nThese changes indicate that the Larsen A and Larsen B\nice shelves reacted to the changing climate significantly be-\nfore their collapse. The causes of these pre-collapse changes\nand their link to the changing climate, however, are still\npoorly understood. It is accepted that rapid regional warming\nhas been occurring on the Antarctic Peninsula over the last\n50 years, at a rate of 3.7\u00b1 1.6\u25e6C per century (Vaughan et al.,\n2003). The steady retreat and collapse of the northern Larsen\nIce Shelf coincided with this warming trend on the east coast\n(Skvarca et al., 1998). In 2006, the first direct evidence link-\ning human activity to the collapse of Larsen ice shelves was\nreported (Marshall et al., 2006). That study showed that the\nSouthern Hemisphere Annular Mode has been enhanced by\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and has had a profound effect on\nAP summer temperatures by causing warm Fo\u00a8hn winds to\nblow off the Antarctic Peninsula. If warming continues, the\nLarsen C may soon display a similar pattern of retreat.\n4.2.3 Larsen C Ice Shelf (Fig. 4.11)\nLarsen C Ice Shelf (67\u25e630\u2032 S, 62\u25e630\u2032 W) is the largest ice\nshelf on the AP, currently at just under 51,000 km2. It ex-\ntends from Jason Peninsula in the north to Gipps Ice Rise in\nthe south, where it merges with Larsen D Ice Shelf. To date,\nthis ice shelf has not shown evidence of climate driven re-\ntreat, as the variations in the ice front follow normal ice-shelf\nfluctuation patterns.\nThere has been relatively little discussion about Larsen\nC Ice Shelf compared with its neighbours, Larsen A and\nB. Skvarca (1994) described changes in the ice-shelf mar-\ngins and surface-ice features along the Larsen Ice Shelf from\nCape Longing as far south as Ewing Island. He noted ad-\nvance along the area \u223c 70 km southeast of Jason Peninsula\nsince 1975, observing that the ice shelf is sustained by snow\naccumulation as there is no significant glacier input from Ja-\nson Peninsula. For the majority of the Larsen C ice front, to\nGipps Ice Rise, there was major change between 1975 and\n1988. The ice shelf is heavily rifted and crevassed, strongly\ninfluenced by the inflow of land ice, mainly through Cabinet,\nMill, Whirlwind and Mobiloil Inlets. A section broke off the\nnorthernmost part, shortly after being hit by an iceberg in\n1976, but the major change occurred in 1986 by the calving\nof two giant icebergs. The larger berg was \u223c 6520 km2 in\narea and the smaller one \u223c 1260 km2 (Skvarca, 1994). In to-\ntal the area of ice lost from Larsen C between 1975 and 1988\nwas 7800 km2. Since then there have been no further large\ncalving events and the ice front has been slowly advancing. It\nis currently at 90% of its original size (in 1963) and appears\nto remain stable.\nPrior to the calving event in 1986, the ice shelf floated free\nto the north of Gipps Ice Rise. The rise acted as a constrain-\ning point causing chasms and inlets to form parallel to the\nice front, which formed lines of weakness where the calving\ntook place (Skvarca, 1994). It is thought that this was not\nclimate-driven retreat but part of the natural process of ice\nshelf mass balance regulation. If the same atmospheric and\noceanic forces are at play which caused its neighbours to col-\nlapse, however, Larsen C Ice Shelf is also expected to retreat.\nThe timescale and possible mechanism are as yet uncertain.\nUsing satellite radar measurements from 1992 and 2001,\nShepherd et al. (2003) found that the northernmost sections\nof Larsen C displayed the greatest decrease in surface el-\nevation, 0.27\u00b1 0.11 ma\u22121. Towards the southern tip how-\never, the ice shelf thickened where ice is discharged from\nPalmer Land. The mean rate of elevation change of Larsen C\nwas 0.08\u00b1 0.04 ma\u22121. There is evidence that nearby Wed-\ndell Deep Waters (WDW) have warmed (Robertson et al.,\n2002), and in 2002 oceanographic measurements showed\nlarge quantities of Modified Weddell Deep Waters (MWDW)\npresent in front of the northern Larsen C (Nicholls et al.,\n2004). The study by Shepherd et al. (2003) stated that al-\nthough basal melt rates are uncertain, enhanced ocean melt-\ning has been and is thinning the Larsen Ice Shelf. They pre-\ndicted that if basal melting continues at the estimated rate of\n0.78 ma\u22121, Larsen C will approach the thickness of Larsen\nB at the time of its collapse in around 100 years, or more\nrapidly with a warming ocean (Shepherd et al., 2003).\nConversely, other research indicates that it is unlikely that\ntemperature changes of the deep Weddell Sea are having\na major impact on melt rates at the base of Larsen C Ice\nShelf (Nicholls et al., 2004). Observations show that al-\nthough MWDW is present at the ice front, the Ice Shelf\nWater is not derived from this directly, but from MWDW\npre-conditioned by winter cooling and by salinification from\nsea-ice production. This suggests that there is no clear\nsource of warm water for increased basal melting, since the\npre-conditioned MWDW is cooled to the surface freezing\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 93\nFig. 4.11. Larsen C Ice Shelf\ntemperature. Recent modelling suggests there are regions of\nbasal freezing (Holland et al., 2009) and this supports the\nprevalence of cold MWDW beneath Larsen Ice Shelf. There\nis an urgent need for more data before further conclusions\ncan be drawn (Nicholls et al., 2004).\n4.2.4 Larsen D (Fig. 4.12)\nLarsen D Ice Shelf is a unique ice shelf on the AP, as it\nhas advanced over the past 50 years, although this has been\nsmall relative to the retreats of the other ice shelves. The\nice shelf extends from Gipps Ice Rise (68\u25e645\u2032 S, 60\u25e645\u2032 W)\nsouthwards to Smith Peninsula (74\u25e630\u2032 S, 61\u25e6 W). The first\nice front position for this study was mapped from oblique\naerial photographs taken in 1966 and the area calculated at\n21 700 km2. The most recent calculation was 22 600 km2.\nWithin that time there have been small fluctuations but it can\nbe concluded that Larsen D is generally stable. This ice shelf\nis the furthest from the thermal limit of viability and so it ap-\npears unlikely that it will show signs of change until this limit\nis driven southwards. The Larsen D has been barely men-\ntioned in reports of AP ice shelves. Skvarca (1994) observed\nice margin changes between Gipps Ice Rise and Ewing Island\nand noted a steady advance between 1975 and 1988. In the\nsame period, the surrounding area of fast-ice receded. Fast-\nice exists along the whole front of the Larsen D Ice Shelf. It\nmakes ice front interpretation difficult as the semi-permanent\nsea-ice is of varying thicknesses and almost indistinguishable\nfrom shelf ice on some satellite images. For this study, it was\nimportant to select a consistent ice front between images to\naccurately represent the real position for each decade. Al-\nthough more difficult to interpret than other ice shelves, the\nresults accurately describe the small variations that occurred\nin this area.\n5 Discussion\nAtmospheric warming on the Antarctic Peninsula over the\npast 50 years has been widely documented (King and Ha-\nrangozo, 1998; King, 1994; Harangozo et al., 1994; Skvarca\net al., 1998; Vaughan et al., 2003; Morris and Vaughan, 2003;\nMarshall et al., 2006). At a rate of 3.7\u00b1 1.6 \u25e6C (century)\u22121\nthis is significantly higher than the global mean (0.6\u00b1 0.2 \u25e6C\nduring the 20th Century) and also the rest of the Antarc-\ntic continent (Vaughan et al., 2003). The ultimate cause\nof the atmospheric changes remains to be determined but\nthere is emerging evidence that it can be linked to human\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010\n94 A. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves\nFig. 4.12. Larsen D Ice Shelf\nactivity (Marshall et al., 2006). However, the key point in\nthis warming, is perhaps, that while AP warming is strongest\nin the winter months, warming in the summer is also statis-\ntically significant and has been sufficient to cause a substan-\ntial increase in surface melt-water production on several ice\nshelves (Vaughan, 2006), and the pattern of this increased\navailability of melt-water appears to be linked with the pat-\ntern and sequence of ice-shelf retreat.\nA map showing interpolated mean annual temperature\nacross the AP shows a contrast (3\u20135 \u25e6C) between the east\nand west coast and also reveals that the limit of ice shelves\nclosely follows the \u22129 \u25e6C isotherm (Morris and Vaughan,\n2003) (see Fig. 1b). The limit of ice shelves that have re-\ntreated in the last 100 years is bounded by the \u22129 \u25e6C and\n\u22125 \u25e6C isotherms, suggesting that the retreat of ice shelves in\nthe AP region is consistent with a warming of around \u223c 4\u25e6C\n(Morris and Vaughan, 2003). The retreat of ice shelves on the\nAntarctic Peninsula over the past century is now widely at-\ntributed to atmospheric warming (e.g., Vaughan and Doake,\n1996; Doake and Vaughan, 1991a; Mercer, 1978; Rott et al.,\n1998; Skvarca et al., 1999).\nOne ice front does not appear to fit within the pattern of\nice-shelf retreat being directly related to atmospheric warm-\ning. Prior to this study, fluctuations in the position of the\nsouthern ice front of George VI Ice Shelf have not been dis-\ncussed in the literature. Although the ice shelf has changed\nlittle overall, the southern front has shown retreat since the\n1950s and yet it lies south of the predicted limit of via-\nbility. Because few ice-front positions were available, this\nice shelf was not included in earlier studies that sought to\nestablish a connection between the known pattern of at-\nmospheric temperatures with ice-shelf changes through dis-\ncussion of a southerly-migrating \u201climit of viability\u201d for ice\nshelves (Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Morris and Vaughan,\n2003). The map presented by Morris and Vaughan was de-\nrived by a multivariate regression technique in which the\nmean residuals were approximately two degrees. It shows\nthat the mean annual temperature in the area around the\nsouthern ice front of George VI Ice Shelf is\u221210 \u25e6C (Fig. 1b).\nThis is slightly cooler than the \u22129 \u25e6C mean annual tempera-\nture that was identified as the limit of viability for ice shelves,\nwhich lies to the north. Certainly, this new information re-\nquires a reassessment, or at least adjustment, of the hypoth-\nesised \u22129 \u25e6C isotherm as the limit of viability. The gradient\nof isotherms is shallower on the west coast and therefore the\nisotherm locations could be less precise in this region. To in-\nvestigate whether the concept of a thermal limit of viability\nof ice shelves can survive the introduction of this new data,\nwe must either: determine the distribution of mean annual air\ntemperature in greater detail; allow that the limit can only be\nidentified in approximate terms (existing in the region of \u22129\nto\u221210 \u25e6C); or investigate whether a more refined description\nof the limit of viability is required. The concept of retreat\nbeing driven solely, and unambiguously, by the migration of\na limit of viability based on atmospheric temperatures may\nbe challenged by this increasing quality of data on ice-shelf\nretreat, so in future we must take into account other factors\nsuch as changes in ocean conditions, or refine the concept of\nthe limit of viability based on air temperatures to include the\nnumber of Positive Degree Days (PDD).\nWhether or not the strict concept of a limit of viability is\nproved simplistic, the general pattern of ice-shelf retreat still\nappears to show a connection increasing atmospheric temper-\nature, and production of melt-water. But within this pattern,\nthe specific behaviour of the ice shelves in their response to\nthe warming climate has, as detailed above, varied consid-\nerably, from slow, steady retreat by calving to rapid disin-\ntegration. It appears that many processes are significant in\nmodifying the style and rate of retreat.\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 77\u201398, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/77\/2010\/\nA. J. Cook and D. G. Vaughan: Overview of areal changes of the ice shelves 95\nIce-shelf dynamics and other forcing mechanisms have\nbeen suggested to explain particular phases of retreat and col-\nlapse. The geometry of the embayment in which an ice shelf\nsits, has been shown to have had an effect in controlling the\nresponse of different sides of an ice shelf within a channel\n(e.g. Jones Ice Shelf and Prince Gustav Ice Shelf). The ge-\nometry of the ice front itself could also promote disintegra-\ntion: some ice front configurations may lead to a \u201ccompres-\nsive arch\u201d that leads to stabilization of the ice front position,\nbut if this arch is breached rapid retreat may follow; a mech-\nanism that may have been significant on Larsen B Ice Shelf.\nThe presence of pinning points can also affect the course of\nretreat. This was seen in the Wordie Ice Shelf, where ma-\njor ice rises acted as wedges and contributed to weakening,\nhastening break-up. Conversely, pinning points appear also\nto have acted to support an ice shelf, as in the case of Jones\nIce Shelf, where a small ice rise delayed the retreat of the\nwestern side.\nNot only the stress regime, but also the mass balance\nregime strongly affects the behaviour of the ice shelf. Where\nshelf ice is not fed by grounded ice, it relies on in-situ accu-\nmulation and appears to be more susceptible to rapid break-\nup through surface melting and thinning (e.g. Wilkins Ice\nShelf). The early suggestion that the presence of surface\nmelt-water, or the changed temperature structure this might\ncause, could cause retreat by reducing the fracture toughness\nof the ice (Doake and Vaughan, 1991b), has rarely been men-\ntioned since, but has not been fully discounted. Whereas,\nthe role of melt-water in opening crevasses has been widely\ndiscussed and substantially developed. It is thus now well\nestablished that surface melt-water can be both an instigator\nand indicator of imminent ice-shelf collapse (e.g. Larsen A,\nLarsen B and Wilkins Ice Shelves), although in the case of\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf, which is under uniaxial compression\nthe ice shelf appears to have survived for many decades de-\nspite the presence of large melt ponds. Only the currently\nretreating ice shelves (Larsen B and Wilkins) and the north-\nernmost portion of Larsen C Ice Shelf, have the firn char-\nacteristics and melt season length associated with imminent\nbreak-up (Scambos et al., 2003). The melting may be caused\nby atmospheric warming, but the mechanism for break-up is\ndescribed as being a vertical propagation of water through\ncrevasses causing initial fragmentation of the ice shelf (van\nder Veen, 2007; Scambos et al., 2008). A \u201cdomino effect\u201d\nmay also occur as the rifted ice blocks topple, causing mass\ndisintegration (e.g. Larsen B Ice Shelf) (MacAyeal et al.,\n2003). The melt pools observed on the surface of the Larsen\nC Ice Shelf currently lie to the north of the position of the\n\u22129 \u25e6C isotherm and may be the precursor to collapse in this\nregion, but without knowing the rate of southwards migration\nof the limit of viability the timescale is difficult to predict.\nThe surface texture, ice thickness and ice velocity also\nplay an important part in determining the behaviour of an\nice shelf undergoing retreat. It is also possible that rheolog-\nical weakening of the shear margins can cause an increase\nin the ice flow rates (e.g., Larsen B), and the development\nof rifts and the rupturing of sutures between flow units can\nprecondition an ice shelf to collapse (Glasser and Scambos,\n2008).\nFinally, there appears to be evidence of ice-shelf thinning\ncaused by ocean-driven basal melting (Shepherd et al., 2003),\nwhich could pre-condition ice shelves to retreat. Indeed,\nthere is an undoubted ocean influence on ice shelves; for ex-\nample due to warm intrusions of Upper Circumpolar Deep\nWater currents (southern George VI ice front and Mu\u00a8ller Ice\nShelf) and Modified Weddell Deep Waters (Larsen B and\nLarsen C Ice Shelves). Furthermore, recent modelling has\nsuggested that the basal melt of ice shelves would increase\nquadratically in response to ocean warming (Holland et al.,\n2008). However, there is as yet insufficient data to deter-\nmine whether there are changes in Southern Ocean circula-\ntion sufficient to have contributed to retreat of AP ice shelves.\nFurther oceanographic observations are needed to determine\nthe extent to which ocean temperature and circulation change\nmay impact on the ice shelves.\n6 Conclusions\nIce-shelf retreat may be an icon of climate change science,\nbut not all ice-shelf retreats are the same. There are a variety\nof responses: protracted retreat, rapid collapse and possibly\nstaged-collapse. The rate of retreat does not simply appear to\nbe related to the rate of change of climate, but it is modulated\nby the ice-shelf configuration and conditions of mass bal-\nance. It is not clear exactly which processes dominate in each\ncase or why. There are speculations, but very little defini-\ntive interpretation because most ice shelves can be subject to\nseveral different forces. The foregoing discussion suggests\nthat the theory of a thermal air temperature limit of viability\nseems to work in broad terms but may only be sufficient to\nexplain or predict the general pattern of change. It is almost\ncertainly insufficient to give a more precise predictive capac-\nity for any individual ice shelf. The prediction by Vaughan\net al. (1993) that Wilkins Ice Shelf would collapse in thirty\nyears was arguably 50% wrong, in that much of this ice shelf\nhas already been lost. However, it is questionable whether\nthat ad hoc prediction could be much improved today. The\nbasis for prediction continues to be based on observing the\nbroad patterns and expecting them to continue, rather than on\nfundamental understanding or improvements in modelling.\nThe ice-shelf dynamics we have discussed above (including\nice-shelf geometry, pinning points and pressure zones; sur-\nface melt and texture; mass balance, ice source, thickness\nand velocity) and external forces such as atmospheric and\nocean temperature and sea-ice extent, impact the timing and\nstyle of collapse\/retreat. We must undertake many more de-\ntailed modelling studies and careful sensitivity tests such as\nthose undertaken by Vieli et al. (2007), before we can build\nan effective predictive model.
