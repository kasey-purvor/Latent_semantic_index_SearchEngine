The effect of fluctuations on the conductivity of ion channels is\ninvestigated. It is shown that modulation of the potential barrier at the selectivity site\ndue to electrostatic amplification of charge fluctuations at the channel mouth exerts a\nleading-order effect on the channel conductivity. A Brownian dynamical model of ion\nmotion in a channel is derived that takes into account both fluctuations at the channel\nmouth and vibrational modes of the wall. The charge fluctuations are modeled as a shot\nnoise flipping the height of the potential barrier. The wall fluctuations are introduced\nas a slow vibrational mode of the protein motion that modulates ion conductance both\nstochastically and periodically. The model is used to estimate the contribution to\nthe conductivity of ion channels coming from the electrostatic amplification of charge\nfluctuations.\n1. Introduction\nIon transport through the channels in cellular membranes underlies all electrical\nsignal transduction and processing by living organisms. Accordingly ion channels,\nbeing natural nanotubes, control a vast range of biological functions in health and\ndisease. The understanding of their structure-properties relationship is the subject\nof intensive, ever-growing, fundamental and applied research in biology, physics, and\nnanotechnology [1, 2]. A central problem in studies of ion permeation through biological\nmembrane channels is to understand how channels can be both highly selective between\nalike ions and yet still conduct millions of ions per second [3]. Indeed, selectivity between\nions of the same charge implies that there exists a deep potential well for conducting\ntype ions at the selectivity site of the channel. On the other hand such channels can\npass up to 108 ions per second [4] corresponding to almost free diffusion.\nSignificant progress has been made towards an understanding of this problem over\nthe last few decades. In particular, the molecular structure of the KcsA potassium\nPublished in J. Stat. Mech. P01010 (2009).\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 2\nchannel [5] that discriminates between Na+ and K+ was determined by crystallographic\nanalysis. Furthermore, by detecting the size of the structural fluctuations [6] and\nconformational changes [7], it has become possible to provide the experimental\ninformation needed for molecular modeling of the dynamical features of the observed\nselectivity and gating [8, 9]. In particular, the minimum radius of the selectivity filter\nin KcsA is \u223c0.85A\u02da, which is to be compared with 1.33A\u02da for the ionic radius of K+,\nsuggesting that flexibility of the filter is coupled to ionic translocation [10]. It has\ntherefore become apparent that fluctuations in the channel walls play a fundamental\nrole in maintaining high conductivity in highly selective channels (see also Elber [11]).\nAnother important source of modulation of the electrostatic potential identified in\nearlier research [12, 13] relates to the interaction of the ion in the channel with charge\nfluctuations in the bath solutions. The effect of current fluctuations and noise on the\nchannel entrance rates and on the channel conductivity was also considered in [14, 15].\nIt becomes clear that fluctuations of the electrostatic potential within ion channels\ninduced by various sources may provide a key to the solution of the central problems\nof permeation and selectivity. Models of such fluctuations have thus a central topic of\nresearch on the permeability of ion channels. It is important to note that dynamical\nmodels of ion motion in the channel can also provide a link between studies of the\npermeability of open channels and channels gating. Notwithstanding recent advances,\ntheoretical modeling of the dynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy. In\nparticular, little is yet known about the relative importance of the different dynamical\nmechanisms and sources of fluctuations in the ion channels.\nIn our earlier work we have started to develop a dynamical model [16, 17, 18,\n19, 20, 21] of ionic conductivity through open channels. It takes into account the\ncoupling of ion motion to vibrations of the wall [16, 17] and to charge fluctuations\nat the channel mouth [19, 20]. Our goal is to derive a self-consistent model that\nallows for analytical estimation of the potential barrier at the selectivity site and for\nthe effects of fluctuations on the conductivity of the channels. The starting point of our\napproach is a self-consistent quasi-analytical solution of the Poisson and Nernst-Planck\nequations in the channel, and in the bulk [21], allowing for accurate estimation of the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of ion channels [22] (see also [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]). The\nelectrostatic channel potentials resulting from these estimates can be further used to\nestimate the relative contribution to the channel conductivity from the different sources\nof fluctuations.\nIn this paper we introduce a model of ion permeation that takes into account the\ndynamical effect of the charge fluctuations through the resultant shot noise, and we\ndemonstrate that the latter has a leading-order effect on the transition probabilities.\nWe show that charge fluctuations at the channel mouth can be modeled as a flipping of\nthe electrostatic potential at the selectivity site, which fluctuates between two maximum\nvalues at a rate corresponding to the random arrivals of ions at the channel mouth. The\ntheoretical framework developed will allow us in the future to include into the model\nthe modulation of the potential at the selectivity site due to hydration effects inside the\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 3\nchannel.\nA model of 3D Brownian dynamics simulation of ions in the bulk and inside the\nchannel is described in Sec. 2. Using results of the 3D simulations in the bulk we present\nin Sec. 3 a reduced model of an ion moving in the channel and interacting with the wall\nvibrational modes and with charge fluctuations at the channel entrance. The model uses\nthe channel potential derived from a self-consistent solution of the Poisson equation and\nthe flipping rates of the potential barrier obtained from simulations of Brownian motion\nof ions in the bulk. In Sec. 4, we estimate analytically the mean first passage time of\nthe channel. These estimates are based on the assumption that barrier-crossing and\nbarrier-fluctuations are correlated for a general form of the potential barrier [28]. The\nmean first passage time is calculated as a weighted sum of the escape time \u03c4\u2212 over\nthe low barrier \u2206E0, and the escape time \u03c4+ over the high barrier \u2206E1. The results\nare compared with single-channel data in Sec. 5. Conclusions are drawn and future\ndirections of research are outlined in Sec. 6.\n2. Brownian dynamics simulations in the bulk and inside the channel\nWe consider the following Brownian dynamical model of the ion permeation (see sketch\nin the Fig. 1 (left)). The system is comprised of three compartments of equal size.\nThe middle block represents the protein, through which there is a cylindrical hole\napproximating the open channel. To model the ion\u2019s coupling to the vibrational modes\nof the channel, we introduce a moving segment of the protein wall that is elastically\nbound to the wall. The moving segment is charged and represents the selectivity site.\nThe dynamics of the ions in the bath and channel, and of the moving segment, are\nmodeled using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, see eqs. (2)-(5) coupled to the\nPoisson equation (1).\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b5(~r)\u2207\u03c6(~r)) = \u03c1(~r), (1)\nmi~\u00a8xi +mi\u03b3i~\u02d9xi = ~FC,i + ~Fsr,i + ~FH,i +\n\u221a\n2mi\u03b3ikBT ~\u03bei(t), (2)\nmj~\u00a8xj +mj\u03b3j~\u02d9xj = ~FC,j + ~Fsr,j + ~FH,j +\n\u221a\n2mj\u03b3jkBT ~\u03bej(t), (3)\nmx\u00a8+m\u03b3x\u02d9 = FC + Fch + Fiw,i sin(\u03b2) +\n\u221a\n2m\u03b3kBT\u03be(t), (4)\nM\u03b4R\u00a8 +M\u0393\u03b4R\u02d9 +K\u03b4R = Fiw,M cos(\u03b2) +\n\u221a\n2M\u0393kBT\u03bd(t) (5)\nHere ~rij = ~xi \u2212 ~xj , rij = |~rij|; and mi, ~xi and qi, mi\u03b3i and\n\u221a\n2mi\u03b3ikBT ~\u03bei(t) are the\nmass, position, charge, friction coefficient and the stochastic force of or on the ith ion.\nThe distance between ions i and j is rij . For simplicity, we restrict the analysis to two\ntypes of ion: the index i will correspond to Na+, while index j corresponds to Cl\u2212.\nThe motion of the charged residual of mass M at the selectivity site is characterized by\nthe displacement \u03b4R in the vertical direction from the equilibrium position R and an\nelastic force \u221d K\u03b4R.

Coupling between\nthe motion of the ion in the channel and the normal mode of the wall oscillations is\naccounted for by the term Fiw corresponding to the Coulomb interaction between ion\nand charge at the selectivity site. Retaining only the axial component of the force for\nthe ion motion in the channel, and the radial component of Fiw for the oscillating wall,\nwe have\nFiw,i =\nQqj\n4\u03c0\u01eb\u01eb0d2\nz\nd\n, Fiw,M =\nQqj\n4\u03c0\u01eb\u01eb0d2\n\u03b4R\nd\n.\nHere d =\n\u221a\n((R + \u03b4R)2 + z2), z = x \u2212 xss where x is the coordinate of the ion in the\nchannel, measured along the channel axis, and xss is the location of the selectivity site.\nAn additional coupling of the ion motion to fluctuations of the channel wall is effected\nvia modulation of the channel potential by the moving wall. This is taken into account\nthrough the term Fch in eq. (4). The ions in the bulk (see eqs. (2), (3)) do not feel the\nchannel potential. Instead, their motion is governed by the Coulomb interaction FC , by\nthe short-range interaction Fsr, and by hydration forces FH [3]\n~FC,i =\n\u2211N\nj=1\nqiqj\n4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b50r\n2\nij\n~rij\nrij\n, ~Fsr,i =\n\u2211N\nj=1\n9U0R\n9\nc\nr10ij\n~rij\nrij\n,\n~FH,i =\n\u2211N\nj=1AU0 exp\n(\nRij\u2212rij\nae\n)\nsin\n(\n2\u03c0\nRij\u2212rij\naw\n\u2212 \u03b1\n)]\n~rij\nrij\n,\nwhere A =\n\u221a\n1 + ( aw\n2\u03c0ae\n)2 and \u03b1 = arctan( aw\n2\u03c0ae\n).\nThe effect of the surroundings is taken into account by the average frictional force\nwith friction coefficient mi\u03b3i and a stochastic force\n\u221a\n2mi\u03b3ikBT ~\u03bei(t).

Fch is\nthe dielectric force in the channel, obtained by solving Poisson\u2019s equation numerically\nusing finite volume methods (FVM) [30]. We use the Langevin equation to model\nthe collective motion of the atoms forming the channel protein\u2019s charged ring located\nat the selectivity filter. In this way, our analysis is based on the assumption that\nthe movement of structural domains of the channel protein may be described as the\nmotions of independent, elastically-bound Brownian particles [31]. We have included\nthe damping term M\u0393\u03b4R\u02d9 and the corresponding random force\n\u221a\n2M\u0393kBT\u03bd(t), whose\namplitude is related to the damping constant via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nThe function \u03bd(t) is a Gaussian white noise. Q is the total fixed charge on the flexible\nring interacting with an ion of charge qj on the channel axis z. R is the channel radius,\n\u03b4R is a small variation of the channel radius and K is the elastic constant of the channel\nprotein. In the particular case of the Gramicidin A (GA) channel, the value of the\nelastic constant is estimated by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of\nthe backbone forming its central part, together with the single ion potential of a Na+\nion as it traverses the channel. Using data from [32], we obtain an elastic constant\nof \u223c 1.66 N\/m for a maximum RMSD of 1 A\u02da. The GA channel molecular weight M\nis about 4kDa = 6.64 \u00d7 10\u221224 kg [33]. The diffusion constant of the protein in the\nmembrane is between 10\u221214 and 10\u221216 m2\/s [34].\nThe parameters of the ion-ion interaction are presented in Table. 1.

Right: The arrival time distribution for\npositives(solid line) and negative(dashed line) for cylindrical channel of radius r=6A\u02da\n3. Reduced model for ion channel conduction\nTo derive the reduced model we note that Eqs. (1)-(5) correspond to a many-body\nproblem with widely-varying timescales, ranging from ps (ion fluctuations) to \u00b5s (wall\nvibrations). We further assume that the channel is occupied most of the time by only\none ion, and that the transition rate of ions through the channel is mainly determined\nby escape over the potential barrier at the selectivity site. Thus the effect of the many-\nbody ion dynamics in the bulk on the ion motion in the channel is twofold: (i) delivery\nof ions to the channel mouth and (ii) modulation of the channel potential by the charge\nfluctuations at the channel mouth. Under these physiologically plausible assumptions\none can separate the ion motion in the channel from the many-body ion dynamics in\nthe bulk. The resulting equations of ion dynamics in the channel coupled to the wall\nfluctuations can be written as follows\nm\u03b3x\u02d9 = \u2212dV (x, t)\ndx\n+\n\u221a\n2m\u03b3kBT \u03be(t), (6)\nM\u03b4R\u00a8 +M\u0393\u03b4R\u02d9 +K\u03b4R = Fiw,M cos(\u03b2) +\n\u221a\n2M\u0393kBT\u03bd(t). (7)\nNote that the reduced motion of the conducting ion is overdamped, whereas the wall\nfluctuations are damped. The damped vibrational mode models the relatively slow (on\na time scale of ns) motion of the protein of the channel walls that was suggested [35, 12]\nto be essential for the ion transport process.\nThe potential V (x, t) in our approximation is made up of three main contributions:\n(i) the potential of Coulomb interaction with ions in the bulk solution VC ; (ii) the\nelectrostatic potential induced by interaction with the channel protein Vch; (iii) the\npotential of Coulomb interaction with the wall charge at the selectivity site. By an\naveraging procedure, the effect of multi-ion motion in the bulk solutions is reduced to\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 7\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\u22122\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nt, ns\nC\nha\nrg\ne,\n e\n0 20 40 60 80\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nE\n, k\nB\nT\nx, A\n\u2206 E0\n\u2206 E1\nFigure 3.

(right) The\npotential energy profiles as a function of the position of the ion when: the first ion is\nfixed at the channel mouth (dashed line) and the second is moving along the channel\naxis. The solid line corresponds to the potential energy on a single ion moving on\nthe channel axis, and the potential energy of the passive channel (dotted line). The\nvertical dashed lines show the channel entrance and exit. The height of the potential\nenergy barrier seen by a single ion at the selectivity site as it moves from left hand\nto right hand of the channel is denoted \u2206E0. In the presence of a second ion at the\nchannel\u2019s left mouth this barrier is reduced to \u2206E1.\nthe Coulomb interaction with ions arriving at the channel mouth. The later process can\nbe viewed as a stochastic Poisson process or as shot noise that modulates the potential\nbarrier for the conducting ion at the selectivity site. Our goal is to estimate analytically\nthe effect of this potential modulation on the channel conductivity, as will be discussed\nin detail in the next section.\nTo quantify the effect of multi-ion motion in the bulk on the conducting ion at the\nselectivity site, we have simulated the ion\u2019s Brownian dynamics. The resulting ion-ion\ndistributions in the bulk are shown in Fig. 2 (left). We emphasize that these distributions\nare very close to those obtained earlier in both BD simulations [3] and experiments [36].\nThe arrival time distributions for Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions at the channel mouth (defined as\na cylindrical section of radius R and length R) obtained in our simulations is shown in\nFig. 2 (right). Note that these distributions are exponential for both Cl\u2212 and Na+ with\nmean arrival times \u03c4\u2212 = 471 ps and \u03c4+ = 365 ps respectively. These estimates are in\nagreement with the theoretical estimates in [37]\n\u03c4arrival =\n1\n2\u03c0cDR\n(8)\nwhere c is the ion concentration.\nThe time evolution of the charge in the channel mouth is shown in Fig. 3 (left). It\ncan be seen that the charge at the channel mouth is a Poisson process with the three\nmain states being +1e, 0, and \u22121e. As a first approximation it is convenient to divide\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 8\nthe states of the channel potential affected by the charge fluctuations into two effective\nstates: (i) a state of high conductivity, corresponding to +1e; and (ii) two states of low\nconductivity, corresponding to 0 or \u22121e at the channel mouth. In this approximation\nthe effect of having three states of the potential is taken into account by asymmetry of\nthe transition rates between the two effective states. The corresponding transition rates\ncan be estimated as \u03b1\u00b1 = 1\/ \u3008T\u00b1\u3009, where \u3008T\u00b1\u3009 are mean residence time of two effective\nstates, giving (\u03b1+)\u22121 = 0.22 ns and (\u03b1\u2212)\u22121 = 0.38 ns. The occupation probabilities of\nthese two states are 0.36 and 0.64 respectively. The effect of the wall oscillations on the\nchannel potential was estimated earlier [20] and for simplicity the wall will be assumed\nrigid in the rest of the paper.\nTo estimate the effect of charge fluctuations on the value of the channel potential\nwe solve the Poisson equation for various positions of the conducting ion along the\nchannel axis in two cases: (i) when there are no other ions at the channel entrances;\n(ii) when there is one positive ion at the left entrance to the channel. The results of\nthese calculations are shown in Figure. 3(right). The low-conductivity effective state\nof the channel is shown by the blue solid line and corresponds to the potential barrier\n\u2248 1kBT at the selectivity site. The high conducting state is shown by the dashed line\nand corresponds to a potential barrier height \u2248 0.2kBT , i.e. practically no barrier state.\nIt can be seen that the charge fluctuations are enhanced in channels of low dielectric\nconstant, resulting in strong modulation of the potential barrier at the selectivity site [20]\n(see also [38]).\n0 30 45 60 90\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nE,\n k\nBT\nx, A\nE0\n\u2212\nE1\n\u2212\nE1\n+\nE0\n+\n\u03b1\u2212\nx0 x1\n\u03b1+\nFigure 4. Approximation of the fluctuating potential.\nIt is therefore possible to build a simple model capable of coupling the motion of\nions in the channel to the bath solution.

The charge fluctuations at the channel mouth thus result in flipping of the\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 9\npotential.

(6) and the\nmodel described by Zu\u00a8rcher [28] whose barrier fluctuation is controlled by a dichotomic\nnoise of zero mean and exponential correlation. An approximation of the fluctuating\npotential is sketched in Figure. 4. The similarity of the two problems suggests that there\nis some possibility of semi-analytical estimations of the effect of the charge fluctuations.\n4. Estimation of the mean channel crossing time\nWe are interested in the transition of a particle initially trapped at the channel selectivity\nfilter. This corresponds to the motion of the ion across the interval [x0, x1]. The\napproximate potential in this interval is given by (9). We are interested at the\nunidirectional current, so there is no backward flow of ions. We assume that on average,\nthe channel is always occupied by a single Na+ ion. This arises from the fact that, when\nan ion is sitting in the middle of the channel, it is almost impossible for a second ion to\nenter the channel due to the height of the barrier at the left entrance of the channel, as\ncan be seem from Figure. 4.\nAs a first approximation, we assume that the mean first passage time (MFPT) is\nonly determined by escape. Therefore the MFPT for the channel is expected to be a\nfunction of the two times \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2212 corresponding to the escape times from the potential\nminimum in two effective states of the potential. Our derivation follows very closely the\nearlier discussion by Zu\u00a8rcher [28] with the difference that, here, we are interested in the\nasymmetric case with two transition rates.\nAssuming no back-flow, the quantities \u03c4\u00b1(x) are defined [39] by:\n\u22121\nm\u03b3\ndV+\ndx\nd\u03c4+\ndx\n+\nkBT\nm\u03b3\nd2\u03c4+\ndx2\n\u2212 \u03b1+\u03c4+ + \u03b1\u2212\u03c4\u2212 = \u2212p+, (10)\n\u22121\nm\u03b3\ndV\u2212\ndx\nd\u03c4\u2212\ndx\n+\nkBT\nm\u03b3\nd2\u03c4\u2212\ndx2\n\u2212 \u03b1\u2212\u03c4\u2212 + \u03b1+\u03c4+ = \u2212p\u2212, (11)\nThe potential jumps between positive and negative values, with respective rates \u03b1+ and\n\u03b1\u2212. p\u00b1 are the occupation probabilities of these states.

(29)\nThe effect of shot noise on ion channel conduction is related to the arrival of ions at\nthe channel\u2019s mouth. We calculated the channel MFPT as a function of the two flipping\nrates. Since the channel has a high affinity for the ions and therefore slows them down,\nwe have used a smaller ion diffusion coefficient inside the channel equal to 1.33\u00d7 10\u221210\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 12\nm2s\u22121. The results of the calculations are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. It is clear from Fig. 5\nthat the particle takes longer to cross \u2206E0 as compared to \u2206E1. There is a fast drop\nin MFPT as the flipping rate \u03b1+ increase. The current I = e\/\u03c4 is also presented as\nfunction of \u03b1+. A more general view of the dependance of the MFPT and the current\non the two rates is shown in Fig. 6. We emphasize that the transition rates obtained are\nessentially non-equilibrium. In particular, a current saturation effect can be observed\nas \u03b1+ increases for a wide range of parameters. This is in accord with experimental the\nobservation [33] of current saturation at high concentrations.\n5. Comparison with experiment\n6. Conclusion\nIn summary, we have introduced a Brownian dynamical model of ionic transitions\nthrough a channel, taking into account charge fluctuations at the channel mouth and the\nfluctuations of the channel walls. The statistical properties of the charge fluctuations\nwere reconstructed from 3D Brownian dynamics simulations of multi-ion motion in\nthe bulk solution. It was shown that distributions of ion arrival times at the channel\nmouth are exponential. It was further shown that these charge fluctuations strongly\nmodulate the potential barrier for the conducting ion at the selectivity site due to\namplification of electrostatic interactions in long narrow channels of low dielectric\nconstant. These findings have allowed us to model the mean ion transition time\nthrough the channel as an ionic escape from the potential well at the selectivity site\ninduced by thermal fluctuations and by modulation of the height of the barrier by\nstochastic Poisson processes. The proposed model is a Brownian dynamical model\nof a \u201cknock-on\u201d mechanism [40, 41]. It allows for analytic estimation of transition\nprobabilities in the presence of charge fluctuations, i.e. it allows for analytic estimation\nof correlations between bulk concentrations and ion currents in charged narrow channels.\nIn particular, it demonstrates the effect of current saturation due to ion concentrations\nin the bath. The model is of an essentially non-equilibrium character. This last point is\nworth emphasizing because traditional approaches assume equilibrium rates of hopping\nbetween the sites.\nThe model takes account of the wall fluctuations. This latter feature is very\nimportant e.g. for an analysis of the tightly correlated motion at the selectivity site, of\nthe type discovered in KcsA [42]. Our model allows for analytic estimation of transition\nrates in the presence of oscillations of channel walls, using our earlier results [43]\non escape from periodically driven potentials based on application of the logarithmic\nsusceptibility [44], as will be discussed in detail elsewhere. Such an escape process,\nassisted by the periodic modulation of the potential barrier by the wall oscillations,\ncan result on its own in selectivity between alike ions due to the difference in their\ndiffusion coefficients [45, 46]. However, ultimately the selectivity of the channel has to\nbe incorporated into the model by taking into account the effects of hydration [47] (see\nCharge fluctuations and their effect on conduction in biological ion channels 13\nalso [20] for a discussion of how hydration effect can be incorporated in our model). It is\nalso worth mentioning that a model taking into account wall fluctuations may account\nfor dissipation of energy in the channel, for self-induced acceleration of the transition\nrate of the ion through the channel, and for coupling of the ion motion to the channel\ngating mechanics. Indeed, in this model, part of the energy induced by a very strong\nCoulomb interaction between the charged site at the channel wall and the moving ion is\nstored as the energy of vibrational modes. The latter energy is only partially dissipated\nby the protein phonon modes. The remaining energy can now be used to modulate\nthe potential barrier for the moving ion in a self-consistent manner to accelerate its\ntransition through the channel. It can also be used to assist the conformational changes\nthat lead to channel gating.\nThe work in progress contains a plethora of unsolved problems. The immediate\nextension of the proposed model will be to include more then two levels for the potential\nat the selectivity site, taking into account positive and negative (or zero) charge at each\nmouth of the channel. The model can be further refined by including estimates of the\nreturn times corresponding to a return of the ion in the channel to the initial bulk\nsolution.\nFollowing the discussion above, we formulate the following general unsolved\nproblems in ion channels:\n(i) The role of the membrane fluctuations.\n(ii) The role of the hydration potential.\n(iii) The role of additional binding sites outside the selectivity filter.\n(iv) The energetics of the ion transition including energy relaxation due to the coupling\nto the protein phonon modes (wall oscillations).\n(v) The coupling of the ion-wall interaction to the gating mechanism.\nWe believe that they can all be be tackled by extending the model introduced in this\npaper. In each case, noise and dynamical effects seem to play a crucial role that is only\njust starting to be elucidated.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK) for\nfinancial support, and to A.
