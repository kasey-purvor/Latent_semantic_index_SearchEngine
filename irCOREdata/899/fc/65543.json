Introduction \nAn intense debate has been taking place in recent years about the extent to which \nfirms\u2019 investment is constrained by the availability of finance, and more specifically, \nabout whether a positive and statistically significant relationship between investment \nand cash flow can be seen as an indicator of financial constraints (see Schiantarelli, \n1995; Hubbard, 1998; and Bond and Van Reenen, 2005, for surveys).  \nThe debate has been almost entirely based on data from firms quoted on the \nstock market. Yet, financial constraints on quoted firms are likely to be relatively \nweak, as these firms are typically large, long-established, financially healthy \ncompanies with good credit ratings. A sharper test of the effects of financial \nconstraints on investment would be obtained from a sample that included a large \nnumber of unquoted firms, which are more likely to be characterized by adverse \nfinancial attributes such as poor solvency, a short track record, and low real assets \ncompared to quoted firms. \nAccordingly, in the present study, we attempt to shed further light on the \ndebate by using, for the first time, a large panel of financial data on UK firms, over 99 \npercent of which are not quoted on the stock market. Specifically, we estimate, both \nseparately and jointly, the effects of \u201cinternal\u201d financial constraints (availability of \ninternal funds) and \u201cexternal\u201d financial constraints (access to external finance) on \nfirms\u2019 investment. Using firms\u2019 cash flow and coverage ratio as measures of the \nformer, and firms\u2019 size and age as proxies for the latter, we find that the sensitivity of \ninvestment to cash flow responds differently according to the type of constraint. The \nsensitivity is particularly large when external constraints are strong and internal \nconstraints are weak. This suggests that investment by successful young, small firms \nmay be significantly constrained by access to external finance, which has long been a \nmatter of policy concern. \nThe remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2, we provide an \neconomic background for our analysis. Section 3 contains a description of our data \nset, together with some summary statistics. Section 4 illustrates our baseline \nspecification and our estimation methodology. Section 5 presents our main results and \nrobustness tests, and Section 6 concludes. \n \n \n \n 3\n2. Economic background \nThe debate on whether high sensitivities of investment to cash flow can be interpreted \nas indicators of financial constraints started with Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen\u2019s \n(FHP hereafter) 1988 pioneering paper, according to which firms with low dividend \npayout ratios (i.e. firms that are more likely to face financial constraints) display a \nhigh sensitivity of investment to cash flow. A number of papers followed, focusing \nnot only on firms\u2019 investment behavior, but also on their inventory investment \n(Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998; Kashyap et al., 1994; Guariglia, 1999, 2000; Benito, \n2005), their R&D investment (Bond et al., 1999; Carpenter and Petersen, 2002b), \ntheir employment decisions (Nickell and Nicolitsas, 1999; Sharpe, 1994); and more in \ngeneral their growth (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002a). These studies generally \nsupported FHP\u2019s (1988) main conclusion. \nA significant challenge to FHP\u2019s (1988) work came with Kaplan and Zingales \n(hereafter KZ, 1997). Instead of using the dividend payout ratio as an indicator of \nfinancial constraints, these authors used other criteria, reclassifying FHP\u2019s low-\ndividend sub-sample of firms on the basis of information contained in the firms\u2019 \nannual reports as well as managements\u2019 statements on liquidity. They found that \ninvestment at firms that appeared less financially constrained by these criteria was \nmore, rather than less, sensitive to cash flow than investment at other firms. They \ntherefore concluded that higher sensitivities of investment to cash flow cannot be \ninterpreted as evidence that firms are more financially constrained. A heated debate \nfollowed (Cleary, 1999; FHP, 2000; KZ, 2000; Allayannis and Mozumdar, 2004; \nCleary et al., 2007).  \nThe different conclusions reached by these two groups of authors can be explained \nby the different ways in which they measured financial constraints. On the one hand, \nmost studies that have found results in line with those of FHP (1988) defined financial \nconstraints using criteria such as firms\u2019 size, age, dividend payout ratio, or \ninformation on whether they have a bond rating and\/or access to commercial paper. \nThese criteria can be seen as proxies of the extent to which firms are susceptible to the \neffects of information asymmetries, which translate themselves in difficulties in \nobtaining external funds (i.e. as proxies for the degree of external financial constraints \nfaced by the firms). Smaller and younger firms are particularly susceptible to \ninformation asymmetry effects, since little public information is available for them, \nand it is more difficult for financial institutions to gather this information. Obtaining \n 4\nexternal finance is therefore likely to be particularly costly for these firms (Bernanke \net al., 1996). Similarly, when seeking for external finance, firms with a low dividend-\npayout ratio are also likely to be subject to moral hazard and adverse selection \nproblems. In an asymmetric information setting, dividends are in fact used by firms to \nconvey information to shareholders, and more in general, to the outside world. Firms \nthat pay high dividends signal that they have good long-term prospects, while the \nopposite holds for low-dividend paying firms (Bhattacharya, 1979; John and \nWilliams, 1985; Miller and Rock, 1985). Once again, obtaining external finance will \nbe more difficult for the latter. Finally, variables such as access to the commercial \npaper market and bond rating are used because firms must reach a minimum size, \ncollateral level, and age before the additional risk associated with information \nasymmetries is low enough to make bond issuance feasible or to obtain access to the \ncommercial paper market (Calomiris et al., 1995). \nOn the other hand, the majority of studies that have found results in line with KZ \n(1997), classified firms or observations on the basis of indicators related to the level \nof internally generated funds available to them, which can be seen as a proxy for the \ndegree of internal financial constraints that they face. In particular, KZ (1997) based \ntheir sample separation criteria essentially on variables related to firms\u2019 liquidity \n(which is obviously strongly correlated with the level of internal funds available to \nfirms). Similarly, Cleary (1999) used a number of variables strongly related to firms\u2019 \ninternal funds (e.g. the current ratio, the coverage ratio etc.) to construct an index of \nfirms\u2019 financial strength1. \nThese considerations strongly suggest that internal and external financial \nconstraints have different effects on the investment-cash flow relationship. One of the \ncontributions of this paper is to investigate this issue more in depth. It has to be noted, \nhowever, that the concepts of internal and external financial constraints may be \nrelated. A firm with greater internal cash flow may in fact find it easier to obtain \nexternal finance, as it will be perceived as less risky by lenders, considering that a \nhigh internal cash flow can be seen as evidence of the firm\u2019s managers\u2019 commitment \n                                                 \n1Exceptions are Kadapakkam et al. (1998) and Cleary (2006) who estimated investment equations for a \nnumber of developed countries, and found that the sensitivities of investment to cash flow are often \nhigher for larger firms and firms with higher dividend payout ratios. Yet, as discussed in Islam and \nMozumdar (2002), their results are likely to be driven by insufficient cross-sectional heterogeneity in \nwithin-country samples. \n 5\nto their investment projects (Leland and Pyle, 1977). Conversely, firms that are \ninternally financially constrained will find it more difficult to obtain external finance. \nThe work of Cleary et al. (2007) is most clearly related to ours in that it also \nattempts to distinguish (both theoretically and empirically) between the effects of \ninternal and external financial constraints on the sensitivity of investment to cash \nflow. Specifically, Cleary et al. (2007) construct a model showing that this sensitivity \nis determined by the interactions between a cost and a revenue effect. On the one \nhand, the cost effect arises because, assuming that internal funds are high but \ninsufficient to finance all of the firm\u2019s investment requirements, higher levels of \ninvestment are typically associated with higher borrowing, higher repayment costs, \nand, consequently, a higher risk of default. This effect suggests a positive relationship \nbetween cash flow and investment: a drop in cash flow leads to a drop in investment, \nas this strategy allows the firm to avoid the higher borrowing, higher repayment costs, \nand resulting higher risk of default that would follow from keeping investment \nconstant or from increasing it. On the other hand, a revenue effect arises because a \nhigher level of investment generates higher revenue, which lowers the firm\u2019s risk of \ndefault. This effect suggests a negative relationship between cash flow and \ninvestment. In this case, a drop in cash flow leads to higher investment, as this \nstrategy improves the firm\u2019s ability to repay its debt, avoiding bankruptcy, and \nincreases the lender\u2019s payoff in case of default. \nBecause both cost and revenue effects operate in the economy, and because the \ntwo effects lead to different predictions about the sensitivity of investment to cash \nflow, the exact relationship between these two variables depends on which of the two \neffects prevails. If the cost effect dominates, then one should observe a positive link \nbetween investment and cash flow, whereas if the revenue effect dominates, a \nnegative link should be observed. According to Cleary et al. (2007), the latter scenario \ntakes place for firms characterized by negative (or particularly low) internal funds. \nFor these firms, a large share of any loan would have to be used to pay existing debts \nor cover fixed costs, i.e. to try and make cash flow positive. Therefore, in the presence \nof a falling cash flow, these firms would have to increase their investment, in order to \ngenerate sufficient revenue to achieve this goal. \nThe model\u2019s predictions are therefore as follows. If firms are classified on the \nbasis of their internal funds (i.e. on the basis of their cash flow, or more in general, of \nthe degree of internal financial constraints that they face), then the relationship \n 6\nbetween investment and cash flow should be U-shaped, with firms characterized by \nnegative (or particularly low) cash flow displaying negative investment-cash flow \nsensitivities. If on the other hand, firms are classified on the basis of indicators of the \ncapital market imperfections that they face, such as size, age, or bond rating (i.e. \nindicators of asymmetric information, or more in general, of the degree of external \nfinancial constraints that they face), then the relationship between investment and \ncash flow could be positive or negative depending on whether the cost or the revenue \neffect dominates. The former effect is more likely to dominate if the negative cash \nflow observations are few or totally absent from the sample. The model also predicts \nthat when the relationship between investment and cash flow is positive, increased \ninformational asymmetry strengthens the investment-cash flow sensitivity. Cleary et \nal. (2007) test their model using data for US quoted firms drawn from Compustat and \nfind strong empirical support for it. \nOur work differs from Cleary et al. (2007)\u2019s in four important ways. First, and \nmost importantly, while their sample is confined to quoted firms (in the United \nStates), which are unlikely to display a wide enough range of financial constraints, \nours mainly includes unquoted firms. This is important considering that Cleary et al. \n(2007) themselves state that \u201cit is difficult to find good proxies for capital market \nimperfections that vary enough across observations in the sample (especially with \nCompustat data, where all firms are publicly traded).\u201d (p. 31). \nSecond, our paper is based on a sample from the United Kingdom. The relative \nlack of corporate bond and commercial paper markets, the relative thin and highly \nregulated banking and equity markets, and the relatively small amount of venture \ncapital financing, seem to make the idea of financial constraints that affect firm \nbehavior more plausible in a European context than in the US. \nThird, we provide a richer analysis of the effects of internal and external \nconstraints: our analysis provides estimates not only of the individual effects that \ninternal and external financial constraints have on the sensitivities of firms\u2019 \ninvestment to cash flow, but also of the effects of various combinations of these two \ntypes of constraints, trying to identify those combinations leading to higher \nsensitivities.  \n 7\nFinally, instead of using a Q model framework to estimate our investment \nregressions, we use error-correction specifications2. The main advantage of using an \nerror-correction model (ECM) is that it leads to a more flexible specification than the \nQ approach, which is consequently less likely to suffer from mis-specification \nproblems. In particular, contrary to the Q model, the ECM specification maintains the \nlong-run properties of value-maximising investment models, but does not impose the \nrestrictions on short-run dynamics associated with particular adjustment cost \nspecifications. Moreover, using the ECM specification allows us to by-pass to a \ncertain extent the criticism according to which cash flow might be an important \ndeterminant of investment, simply because it accounts for investment opportunities, \nwhich are poorly measured by Tobin\u2019s Q (Cummins et al., 2006). \n \n3. Main features of the data and summary statistics \n3.1 The data set \nWe construct our data set from the profit and loss and balance sheet data gathered by \nBureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing in the Financial Analysis Made Easy (FAME) \ndatabase. This provides information on companies for the period 1993-2003. Over 99 \npercent of the firms in the data set are not traded on the stock market. The firms in our \ndata set operate in a wide range of industrial sectors, namely agriculture, forestry and \nmining; manufacturing; construction; retail and wholesale; hotels and restaurants; and \nbusiness and other services3. Having access to firms operating in sectors other than \nmanufacturing is beneficial for us, considering that the majority of studies that looked \nat the effects of financial constraints on firms\u2019 activities have focused essentially on \nthe manufacturing sector. Yet, as explained in Bernanke et al. (1996), the share of \nsales by \u201csmall\u201d firms is generally greater in other sectors.  \nWe measure investment (I) as the purchase of fixed tangible assets by the firm. \nCash flow (CF) is obtained as the sum of the firm\u2019s after-tax profits and depreciation. \nOur measure of the replacement value of capital stock (K) is calculated using the \nstandard perpetual inventory formula (Blundell et al., 1992). In particular, we use \ntangible fixed assets as the historic value of the capital stock. We assume that \nreplacement cost and historic cost are the same in the first year of data for each firm. \n                                                 \n2 Given that our panel includes mainly unquoted firms, it would be impossible to estimate a Q model, \nas Tobin\u2019s Q, which is defined as the market value of the firm over the replacement value of its capital \nstock, cannot be calculated for unquoted firms. \n 8\nWe then apply the perpetual inventory formula as follows: Kt+1 = Kt *(1-\u03b4)*(pt+1 \/pt )+ \nIt, where t indexes time; \u03b4 represents the depreciation rate, which we assume to be \nconstant and equal to 5.5 percent for all firms; and pt is the price of investment goods, \nwhich we proxy with the implicit deflator for gross fixed capital formation. \nWe exclude companies that changed the date of their accounting year-end by \nmore than a few weeks, so that the data refer to 12 month accounting periods. Firms \nthat do not have complete records on investment, cash flow, or sales are also dropped, \nas well as firms with less than 3 years of continuous observations. Finally, to control \nfor the potential influence of outliers, we exclude observations in the 1 percent tails \nfor each of the regression variables. These cut-offs are aimed at eliminating \nobservations reflecting particularly large mergers, extraordinary firm shocks, or \ncoding errors. These types of rules are common in the literature and we employ them \nto ensure comparability with previous work (Bond et al., 2003; Cummins et al., 2006). \nThe data sets that we use in estimation include a total of 39270 annual \nobservations on 7534 companies, when we only focus on the manufacturing sector; \nand 124590 annual observations on 24184 companies, when we focus on our broader \nrange of industries. Both samples cover the years 1996-2003 and have an unbalanced \nstructure, with the number of years of observations on each firm varying between 3 \nand 84. By allowing for both entry and exit, the use of an unbalanced panel partially \nmitigates potential selection and survivor bias. \n \n3.2 Sample separation criteria \nWe use the level of the cash flow to beginning-of-period capital stock ratio available \nto firms as a proxy for the degree of internal financial constraints that they face, and \nthe firms\u2019 size as a proxy for the degree of external financial constraints that they \nface. It is sensible to use cash flow as a proxy for internal funds for two main reasons. \nFirst, cash flow can take negative values. This is particularly important as according \nto Cleary et al.\u2019s (2007) model, it is for those firms whose internal funds are \nsufficiently negative, that a negative relationship between investment and internal \n                                                                                                                                            \n3 Following Cleary et al. (2007), we exclude firms operating in regulated or financial sectors.  \n4 See Appendix 1 in Guariglia (2007) for more information on the structure of our panel and more \ncomplete definitions of all variables used. Also note that because our model includes variables lagged \nup to two times and is estimated in first-differences, the first three cross-sections of the data cannot be \nused in estimation: for this reason, although our original data set covers the period 1993-2003, the data \nset actually used in estimation only covers the years 1996-2003. \n 9\nfunds is more likely to be observed. Second, cash flow has been widely used in the \ninvestment literature as a measure of internal funds (see Schiantarelli, 1995; Hubbard \net al., 1998, and Bond and Van Reenen, 2005). Yet, cash flow is not a perfect measure \nof internal funds because it is a flow variable, which does not include the stock of \nfunds accumulated in the past. One can, however, claim that since cash flow is the \nmain source of variation in internal funds, firms with negative cash flow are likely to \nhave a low or negative level of internal funds (Cleary et al., 2007). \nWe first test whether cash flow has a differential impact on the investment of \nfirms with different degrees of internal financial constraints. For this purpose, as in \nCleary et al. (2007), we initially split firms on the basis of their cash flow to \nbeginning-of-period capital stock ratio. We therefore construct the following dummy \nvariables: \ni. NEGCFit, which is equal to 1 if firm i has a negative cash flow to capital \nratio at time t, and equal to 0, otherwise; \nii. MEDCFit, which is equal to 1 if firm i has a positive cash flow to capital \nratio in year t, which falls below the 75th percentile of the distribution of the \ncorresponding ratios of all the firms operating in the same industry as firm i \nin that particular year, and equal to 0, otherwise; \niii. HIGHCFit, which is equal to 1 if firm i displays a positive cash flow to \ncapital ratio in year t, which falls above the 75th percentile of the distribution \nof the corresponding ratios of all the firms operating in the same industry as \nfirm i in that particular year, and equal to 0, otherwise.  \nWe use these dummies in our investment regressions as interactions on the cash flow \nterm. In this way, we allow firms to transit between classes5. \nTo check robustness, we also use firms\u2019 financial status dummies defined in a \nsimilar way as above, but based on their coverage ratio (NEGCOVit; MEDCOVit, \nHIGHCOVit). The coverage ratio is defined as the ratio between firms\u2019 total profits \nbefore tax and before interest and their total interest payments, and indicates the \navailability of internal funds that firms can use to finance their real activities. As the \ncoverage ratio has been widely used in the literature on the effects of financial \nconstraints on firms\u2019 activities (see Carpenter et al., 1998; Guariglia, 1999, 2000; and \n                                                 \n5 For this reason, our empirical analysis will focus on firm-years rather than simply firms. See Kaplan \nand Zingales (1997) and Guariglia (2000) for a similar approach. The equations that we estimate are \ndescribed in detail in Section 4.1. \n 10\nWhited, 1992), we use this variable as our second measure of firms\u2019 internal funds, \ninstead of the net liquidity to capital ratio, which was used by Cleary et al. (2007). \nWe then investigate whether cash flow has a different impact on the \ninvestment of firms facing different degrees of external financial constraints. For this \npurpose, we first partition firms on the basis of their size, measured by their total real \nassets. Smaller firms are likely to face more severe problems of asymmetric \ninformation as they are more likely to suffer from idiosyncratic risk, and to have \nlower collateral values in relation to their liabilities, as well as higher bankruptcy \ncosts, and short track records (Schiantarelli, 1995). Each year, we consider a firm\u2019s \nsize in comparison with the situation of other firms in the industry in which that firm \noperates. We define as small firm-years (SMALLit=1) within an industry, those firms \nwhose real assets in year t are in the lowest quartiles of the distribution of the assets of \nall the firms in that particular industry and year. Similarly, we define as medium-sized \nfirm-years (MEDIUMit=1) within an industry, those firms whose real assets in year t \nfall in the second and third quartiles of the distribution. Finally, large firm-years \n(LARGEit=1) are those firm-years with assets in the highest quartile of the \ndistribution.  \nTo check robustness, we also define the degree of asymmetric information \nfaced by our firms in capital markets on the basis of their age, which is defined as the \ntime elapsed since the incorporation date of the company. Younger firms are more \nlikely to face problems of asymmetric information, as their short track record makes it \nmore difficult to judge their quality. We consider as young firm-years (YOUNGit=1) \nwithin an industry, those firms whose age in year t falls in the lowest quartiles of the \ndistribution of the ages of all the firms in that particular industry and year. Similarly, \nwe define as middle-aged firm-years (MIDDLEAGEDit=1) within an industry, those \nfirms whose age in year t is in the second and third quartiles of the distribution. \nFinally, old firm-years (OLDit=1) are those with age in the highest quartile of the \ndistribution6.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6 All our results were generally robust to using different cut-off points both for the internal and the \nexternal financing constraints. Note that all our dummy variables were defined on the full sample, \nwhich is not the sample actually used in estimation for the reasons documented in footnote 4. \n 11\n3.3 Summary statistics \nTable 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the variables used in our \nregressions. Panel A refers to the manufacturing sector only, whereas Panel B refers \nto our broader sample including a wide range of other industrial sectors. In both \npanels of the Table, column (1) refers to the full sample, columns (2) to (4), to the \nsub-samples based on the cash flow to capital ratio, and columns (5) to (7), to the sub-\nsamples based on firms\u2019 size7. \n We can see from both panels of the Table, that when firm-years (indexed by \nit) are classified on the basis of their cash flow to capital ratio (CFit\/Ki(t-1)), sales \ngrowth (\u2206sit) tends to rise monotonically as we move from firm-years with negative \ncash flow to firm-years with high cash flow. The same happens to the investment to \ncapital ratio (Iit \/Ki(t-1)) when we focus on the manufacturing sector (Panel A). \nFurthermore, both for the manufacturing sector and our broader sample, assets tend to \nbe highest for those firm-years in the middle category. When firm-years are divided \non the basis of their assets, it is the smallest firm-years which tend to have the highest \ninvestment to capital ratios, as well as the highest cash flow to capital ratios.  \n Table 2 illustrates the behavior of investment to capital ratios for different \npercentiles of the cash flow to capital ratio. Columns (1) and (2) refer to the \nmanufacturing sector and columns (3) and (4), to our broader sample. In both cases, \nwe can see that the investment-cash flow relationship is U-shaped: the investment to \ncapital ratios reach a minimum when the cash flow to capital ratio is around 0, and \nthen increase both when cash flow becomes negative, and when it rises above 0.  \n It is noteworthy that the percentage of firm-years with negative cash flow is \n12.9 percent in our manufacturing sector sample, and 12.7 percent in our broader \nsample. For small firm-years, the corresponding percentages are 14.5 percent in the \nmanufacturing sector, and 13.5 percent in our broader sample. For medium-sized \nfirm-years, they are 12.7 percent in the manufacturing sector, and 12.8 percent in our \nbroader sample; and for large firm-years 12.6 percent in the manufacturing sector, and \n12.4 percent in our broader sample. It appears therefore that the splits of firm-years on \nthe basis of the cash flow to capital ratio and real assets are not strongly correlated, as \na similar percentage of firms with negative cash flow can be found among the small, \nmedium, and large firm-years, and as real assets do not grow monotonically with cash \n 12\nflow. Dividing firm-years on the basis of their cash flow to capital ratio and on the \nbasis of their assets, will therefore not necessarily lead to equal patterns of the \ninvestment-cash flow sensitivities for financially constrained and unconstrained firm-\nyears. In the section that follows, we will provide formal tests of how the sensitivities \nchange with the degree of internal and external financial constraints faced by firms. \n \n4. Baseline specification and estimation methodology \n4.1 Baseline specification \nWe initially estimate the following error-correction specification (see Bond et al., \n2003; Bond and Lombardi, 2006; and Bloom et al., 2007, for a similar specification): \n \nIit \/Ki(t-1) = a0 + a1Ii(t-1)\/Ki(t-2) + a2\u2206sit + a3\u2206si(t-1) + a4(ki(t-2)-si(t-2)) +  \n+a5 CFit \/Ki(t-1) + vi + vt + vjt + eit     (1) \n \nwhere I is the firm\u2019s investment; K, the replacement value of its capital stock, and k, \nits logarithm; s, the logarithm of real sales; and CF, the firm\u2019s cash flow. The \nsubscript i indexes firms; j, industries; and t, time, where t=1996-20038. \nError-correction behavior enters the empirical framework because of \nadjustment costs. In their presence the firm will not immediately adjust its capital \nstock (k) to the target level (s), which is assumed to be a function of sales. We specify \na dynamic adjustment mechanism between k and s (the details of which are contained \nin Appendix 3 in Guariglia, 2007). To be consistent with error-correction behavior, \nthe coefficient associated with the term (ki(t-2)-si(t-2)) should be negative: if capital is \nlower (higher) than its desired level, future investment should be higher (lower).  \nThe error term in Equation (1) is made up of four components: vi, which is a \nfirm-specific component; vt, a time-specific component accounting for possible \nbusiness cycle effects; vjt, a time-specific component which varies across industries, \naccounting for industry-specific shifts in investment demand or expectations \n                                                                                                                                            \n7 Summary statistics for the sub-samples based on the coverage ratio and on firms\u2019 age are reported in \nTable A1 in Appendix 2 in Guariglia (2007).  \n8 In our manufacturing sample, firms are allocated to one of the following sectors: metals and metal \ngoods; other minerals, and mineral products; chemicals and man made fibres; mechanical engineering; \nelectrical and instrument engineering; motor vehicles and parts, other transport equipment; food, drink, \nand tobacco; textiles, clothing, leather, and footwear; and others (Blundell et al., 1992). In our broader \nsample, firms are allocated to the following groups: agriculture, forestry, and mining; manufacturing; \n 13\n(Carpenter and Petersen, 2002a); and eit, an idiosyncratic component. We control for \nvi by estimating our equations in first-differences, for vt by including time dummies, \nand for vjt by including industry dummies interacted with time dummies in all our \nspecifications.  \nWhen focusing on the differential impact of cash flow on the investment of \ndifferent categories of firms, instead of estimating our investment equations on \nseparate sub-samples of firms as in Cleary et al. (2007), we interact the cash flow \nvariable in all our specifications with dummy variables indicating the degree of \ninternal and external financial constraints faced by the firm. This approach allows us \nto avoid problems of endogenous sample selection; to gain degrees of freedom; and to \ntake into consideration the fact that firms can transit between groups. We estimate \nequations of the type: \n \nIit \/Ki(t-1) = a0 + a1Ii(t-1)\/Ki(t-2) + a2\u2206sit + a3\u2206si(t-1) + a4(ki(t-2)-si(t-2)) +  \n+a51 [CFit \/Ki(t-1)*CATEGORY1it] + a52 [CFit \/Ki(t-1)*CATEGORY2it] +  \na53 [CFit \/Ki(t-1)*CATEGORY3it] + vi + vt + vjt + eit,   (2) \n \nwhere CATEGORY1it, CATEGORY2it, and CATEGORY3it refer in turn to the dummy \nvariables based on the firms\u2019 cash flow to capital ratio (NEGCFit, MEDCFit, \nHIGHCFit); to those based on their coverage ratio (NEGCOVit, MEDCOVit; \nHIGHCOVit); on their size (SMALLit, MEDIUMit; LARGEit); and on their age \n(YOUNGit, MIDDLEAGEDit, OLDit).  \n \n4.2 Estimation methodology \nWe estimate Equations (1) and (2) using the first-difference Generalized Method of \nMoments (GMM) estimator developed by Arellano and Bond (1991). This technique \ntakes unobserved firm heterogeneity into account by estimating the equation in first-\ndifferences, and controls for possible endogeneity problems by using the model \nvariables lagged two or more periods as instruments9.  \n                                                                                                                                            \nconstruction; retail and wholesale; hotels and restaurants; business services; others (which include \neducation, health, social work, repairs entertaining, and renting). \n9 Our results were generally robust to using OLS, the within-groups estimator, and the system-GMM \nestimator developed in Blundell and Bond (1998), as well as to interacting all the regressors with the \nCATEGORY dummies, and to including two of the CATEGORY dummies in addition to the interaction \nterms. These estimates are not reported for brevity, but are available from the authors upon request. \n 14\nIn order to evaluate whether our model is correctly specified, we use two \ncriteria: the Sargan test (also known as J test) and the test for second-order serial \ncorrelation of the residuals in the differenced equation (m2). If the model is correctly \nspecified, the variables in the instrument set should be uncorrelated with the error \nterm in Equations (1) and (2). The J statistic tests overidentifying restrictions. Under \nthe null of instrument validity, it is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square with \ndegrees of freedom equal to the number of instruments less the number of parameters. \nThe m2 test is asymptotically distributed as a standard normal under the null of no \nsecond-order serial correlation of the differenced residuals, and provides a further \ncheck on the specification of the model and on the legitimacy of variables dated t-2 as \ninstruments in the differenced equation10. \n \n5. Empirical results \n5.1 Investment equations without interactions \nTable 3 presents the estimates of Equation (1). Column (1) refers to the full \nmanufacturing sector sample. As expected the error-correction term attracts a negative \nsign, and the sales growth terms are both positive and statistically significant. The \npositive and precisely determined coefficient associated with the cash flow to capital \nratio suggests that the cost effect prevails over the revenue effect: a drop in cash flow \nis associated with a drop in investment, possibly to avoid the higher borrowing, higher \nrepayment costs, and resulting higher risk of default that would follow if investment \nwere to be kept unchanged or increased. The point estimate (0.055) indicates that the \nelasticity of investment with respect to cash flow, evaluated at sample means, is \n0.121. A 10 percent increase in cash flow leads therefore to a 1.21 percent increase in \ninvestment. Neither the Sargan test, nor the m2 test for second-order autocorrelation \nof the differenced residuals indicate problems with the specification of the model or \nthe choice of the instruments. \nColumn (2) reports the full sample estimates, for our broader sample. Once \nagain, the coefficient associated with cash flow (0.038) is positive and precisely \ndetermined. Compared to the manufacturing sector, however, cash flow has a weaker \neffect on firms\u2019 investment: the elasticity of investment with respect to cash flow is \n                                                 \n10 If the undifferenced error terms are i.i.d., then the differenced residuals should display first-order, but \nnot second-order serial correlation. Note that neither the J test nor the m2 test allow us to discriminate \nbetween bad instruments and model specification.  \n 15\nnow 0.107, compared to 0.121 for the manufacturing sector. This might be explained \nby the fact that agency costs are more substantive for manufacturing firms, as their \nassets are \u201cmore specialized\u201d and can less readily \u201cserve as collateral\u201d (Schaller, \n1993). \nIn columns (3) and (4), we present the estimates of similar equations on \nsamples, which exclude observations with negative cash flow to capital ratio. For the \nmanufacturing sector (column 3), the coefficient associated with the cash flow \nvariable is now 0.085, whereas the corresponding coefficient for our broader sample \nis 0.043 (column 4). Both coefficients are precisely determined, and larger than those \nreported in columns (1) and (2), although for our broader sample, the difference in the \ncoefficients is rather small. This finding suggests that the observations with negative \ncash flow have lower (and possibly negative) investment-cash flow sensitivities than \nthe other observations (see Allayannis and Mozumdar, 2004, for a similar finding). \nNext, we will evaluate how exactly the investment-cash flow sensitivities \ndiffer across various sub-groups of firm-years. \n \n5.2 Investment equations with interactions based on the degree of internal \nfinancial constraints faced by firms  \nTable 4 presents the estimates of Equation (2), where the interaction terms are based \non the cash flow to capital ratio (columns 1 and 2, respectively for the manufacturing \nsector and our broader sample), and on the coverage ratio (columns 3 and 4, \nrespectively for the manufacturing sector and our broader sample). Focusing on \ncolumns (1) and (2), we can see that the coefficient associated with cash flow is \nnegative for firm-years with negative cash flow. Column (1) suggests that a 10 \npercent increase in cash flow is associated with a 4.23 percent drop in investment. The \ncorresponding figure for column (2) is 1.69 percent. These figures indicate that for \nfirms with negative cash flow, the revenue effect prevails over the cost effect. For \nthese firms, a large share of any loan would have to be used to pay existing debts or \ncover fixed costs, i.e. to try and make cash flow positive. Therefore, in the presence of \na falling cash flow, these firms would have to increase their investment, in order to \ngenerate sufficient revenue to achieve this goal. \nColumns (1) and (2) also suggest that cash flow does not have a precisely \ndetermined effect on the investment of those firm-years characterized by a moderate \nlevel of cash flow to capital. On the other hand, it plays a positive and significant \n 16\neffect on the investment of firm-years with high cash flow, for which the cost effect is \nlikely to prevail over the revenue effect. For these firm-years, focusing on the \nmanufacturing sector, a 10 percent rise in cash flow is associated with a 2.89 percent \nrise in investment. The corresponding figure for our broader sample is 2.83 percent. \nThese results are in line with the findings in Cleary et al. (2007), who find a U-shaped \ninvestment-cash flow relationship, and with those in KZ (1997), according to which \nthe sensitivity of investment to cash flow is highest for the least financially \nconstrained firms.  \n When the coverage ratio is used to differentiate the effects of cash flow on \nfirms\u2019 investment, we obtain similar results as above for the manufacturing sector \n(column 3). Yet, when our broader sample is considered (column 4), cash flow \nattracts a positive and significant coefficient both for firm-years with middle-sized \nand high coverage ratio. \nTable 4 also reports p-values associated with \u03c72 tests aimed at assessing \nwhether the impact of cash flow of investment is equal across various categories of \nfirms-years. The results suggest that the hypothesis is always rejected when firm-\nyears with negative cash flow\/coverage ratio (which exhibit negative sensitivities) are \ncompared with firm-years with high cash flow\/coverage ratio (which exhibit positive \nsensitivities). The hypothesis is also rejected when firm-years with negative coverage \nratio are compared with firm-years with medium-sized coverage ratio, and when \nmanufacturing firm-years with medium-sized cash flow\/coverage ratio are compared \nwith manufacturing firm-years with high cash flow\/coverage ratio. \n \n5.3 Investment equations with interactions based on the degree of external \nfinancial constraints faced by firms \nTable 5 presents the results of the estimates of Equation (2) when firm-years are \ndifferentiated into small, medium, and large (columns 1 and 2, respectively for the \nmanufacturing sector and our broader sample) and into young, middle-aged, and old \n(columns 3 and 4, respectively for the manufacturing sector and our broader sample), \ni.e. on the basis of the degree of external financial constraints that they face.  \nIn column (1), both small and medium-sized firm-years display a positive and \nprecisely determined sensitivity of investment to cash flow, larger for the former \n(0.10) than for the latter (0.05). The elasticities evaluated at sample means suggest \n 17\nthat a 10 percent rise in cash flow is associated with a 2.82 percent rise in investment \nfor small firms, and a 1.10 percent rise for medium-sized firms. A similar pattern can \nbe observed in column (2), where the coefficients are respectively 0.08 and 0.03 for \nsmall and medium-sized firm-years, indicating that a 10 percent rise in cash flow \nleads to a 2.52 percent rise in investment for small firms, and to a 0.84 percent rise for \nmedium-sized firm-years. For large firm-years, the coefficient associated with cash \nflow is poorly determined in both columns. These findings show that the cost effect \nprevails for small and medium-sized firm-years, and that the former are more \nsensitive to asymmetric information issues than latter. For large firm-years, on the \nother hand, a drop in cash flow has no effect on investment, possibly because it is \nalways possible for them to obtain financing through bank loans or the equity market. \n When firm-years are split on the basis of their age (columns 3 and 4), the \ncoefficients associated with cash flow are once again only significant for the youngest \nand middle-aged firm years, and generally larger for the former.  \nTable 5 also reports p-values associated with \u03c72 tests aimed at assessing \nwhether the impact of cash flow of investment is equal across various categories of \nfirms-years. As expected, the results suggest that the hypothesis is always rejected \nwhen small\/young firm-years are compared with large\/old firm-years. It is rejected in \nthree cases out of four when middle-sized\/middle-aged firm-years are compared with \nlarge\/old firm-years, and except in one case, cannot be rejected when small\/young \nfirm-years are compared with middle-sized\/middle aged firm-years. \nIt appears therefore that, although also significant for middle-sized and \nmiddle-aged firm-years, the sensitivity of investment to cash flow is larger for the \nsmallest and youngest firm-years, which are more prone to facing asymmetric \ninformation problems. The estimates in this Table are in line with the findings in FHP \n(1988), according to which firms more likely to face financial constraints exhibit \nhigher sensitivities of investment to cash flow11.  \nThese findings have significant policy implications: the fact that smaller and \nyounger firms exhibit a higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow suggests that in \norder to make the small business community thrive, policies aimed at making the \n                                                 \n11 The fact that in this Table the investment-cash flow sensitivities are never negative and precisely \ndetermined can be explained by considering that the percentage of firms with negative cash flow is \nrelatively small in all sub-groups of firms.  \n 18\naccess to finance easier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are likely to \nbe particularly effective. \nOur results so far suggest that the different conclusions reached by FHP \n(1988) and KZ (1997) about whether higher sensitivities of investment to cash flow \ncan be interpreted as evidence that firms are more financially constrained, are \nprobably due to the to the different criteria used in their studies to partition their \nsample. We next analyze the sensitivities of investment to cash flow when the sample \nis split on the basis of combinations of various degrees of internal and external \nfinancial constraints. \n \n5.5 Investment equations with interactions based on various combinations of \ninternal and external financial constraints faced by firms \nColumns (1) and (2) of Table 6 present the results of the estimation of Equation (1) \nwhen the effects of cash flow on investment are differentiated across firm-years \nfacing various combinations of internal and external financial constraints, i.e. small, \nmedium, and large firm-years with negative cash flow; small, medium, and large \nfirm-years with medium cash flow; and small, medium, and large firm-years with \nhigh cash flow. \n Column (1) reports the estimates for the manufacturing sector. It appears that \ncash flow attracts a positive and statistically significant effect only for those small and \nmedium-sized firm-years with relatively high cash flow. The coefficient for the \nformer (0.14) is higher than that for the latter (0.09), and higher than the \ncorresponding coefficient on cash flow for small firm-years reported in column (1) of \nTable 5 (0.10). The elasticities evaluated at sample means suggest that a 10 percent \nrise in cash flow is associated with a 6.81 percent rise in investment for small firms \nwith high cash flow, and with a 3.82 percent rise for medium-sized firms with high \ncash flow. These are sizeable effects. The J and m2 tests do not indicate problems \nwith the specification of the model and\/or the instruments chosen.  \n Column (2) reports the estimates for our broader sample. Once again, it is the \nsmall firm-years with relatively high cash flow that display the highest sensitivity of \ninvestment to cash flow (0.07). For these firms a 10 percent increase in cash flow is \nassociated with a 4.53 rise in investment. As in column (1), cash flow attracts a \npositive and significant coefficient also for the medium-sized firm-years with \nrelatively high cash flow. This coefficient (0.04) is however smaller than that for \n 19\nsmall firm-years, and indicates that a 10 percent rise in cash flow is followed by a \n2.51 percent rise in investment. Finally, in this specification, we can also observe a \nnegative and significant coefficient for medium-sized firm-years with negative cash \nflow. \n Columns (3) and (4) of Table 6 presents robustness tests in which cash flow \nand size are respectively replaced with the coverage ratio and age as sample \nseparation criteria. Column (3) presents estimates for the manufacturing sector. Like \nin column (1), it is only those young and middle-aged firm-years with relatively high \ncoverage ratio that display positive and significant sensitivities of investment to cash \nflow. The sensitivities amount to 0.16 and 0.09 respectively for the two types of firm-\nyears. Column (4) refers to our broader sample. The results are similar to those \nreported in column (2). \nWe also perform tests aimed at assessing whether the impact of cash flow on \ninvestment is equal across various categories of firms-years. The results, which we do \nnot report for brevity, suggest that the hypothesis is always rejected when medium-\nsized\/middle aged firm-years with negative cash flow\/coverage ratio (which exhibit \nnegative sensitivities) are compared with small\/young and middle-sized\/middle-aged \nfirms with high cash flow\/coverage ratio (which show positive sensitivities). It is also \nrejected when the comparison is performed with large\/old firm-years with high cash \nflow (which also display positive sensitivities). The hypothesis is rejected in the \nmajority of cases when small\/young and medium-sized\/middle aged firm-years with \nhigh cash flow\/coverage ratio are compared with large\/old firm-years with high cash \nflow\/coverage ratio, as the former typically exhibit positive sensitivities, while the \nlatter show insignificant sensitivities.  \nThe results in Table 6 can be interpreted as follows. External and internal \nfinancial constraints often have opposite effects on the sensitivities of investment to \ncash flow. For internally financially constrained firms, the revenue effect is likely to \nprevail, leading to a negative sensitivity of investment to cash flow. On the other \nhand, for those externally financially constrained firms, which are not internally \nconstrained, the cost effect is likely to prevail, leading to a positive sensitivity. Thus, \nwhen the two types of constraints are combined, the sensitivities are the highest for \nthose firm-years for which the cost effect dominates, i.e. for those which are \nunconstrained internally (having high cash flow and\/or coverage ratios), and \nconstrained externally (being small\/medium-sized and\/or young\/middle-aged).  \n 20\nThe fact that investment at firm-years which are constrained both internally \nand externally (being small\/medium-sized or young\/middle-aged and having a \nnegative cash flow\/coverage ratio) does not seem to be affected by cash flow can be \nexplained by considering that a negative cash flow\/coverage ratio leads to a negative \nsensitivity (given the prevalence of the revenue effect), whereas being small\/medium-\nsized or young\/middle-aged leads to a positive sensitivity (given the prevalence of the \ncost effect). These two contrasting effects might be offsetting each other, leading to a \npoorly determined coefficient for small\/young and middle-sized\/middle-aged firm-\nyears with negative cash-flow\/coverage ratios. For small\/young firm-years with \nnegative cash flow\/coverage ratio, this result could also be explained by considering \nthat these firm-years are particularly likely to be financially distressed. They might \ntherefore have reached the minimum level of investment necessary to carry on \nproduction: further reductions in investment would therefore be impossible, even in \nresponse to declines in cash flow. Financially distressed firms might also be required \nby their creditors to use their cash flow to meet interest payments and\/or improve the \nliquidity of their balance sheet (Fazzari et al., 2000; Allayannis and Monumbar, 2004; \nCleary et al., 2007).  \nInvestment at firm-years with medium-sized cash flow does not seem to be \naffected by changes in cash flow, whatever the degree of external financial constraints \nfaced by the firms. As before, for small\/medium-sized and young\/middle-aged firm-\nyears, this can be explained by considering that these firms might be experiencing \nboth a cost effect, driven by the external dimension of their financial constraints (i.e. \ntheir small\/medium size\/age), and a revenue effect, driven by the internal dimension \n(i.e. the medium-sized cash flow\/coverage ratio), whereby the two offset each other. \nFinally, large\/old firm-years always exhibit insignificant sensitivities, probably \nbecause they do not suffer from financial constraints: even if they are internally \nconstrained, they are always able to access external funds. \nIn the light of these results, in order to make an economy thrive in the short-\nrun, public policies should endeavour to make access to finance easier especially for \nthose SMEs characterized by relatively high levels of internal funds. It is in fact those \nSMEs that will convert this additional finance into additional investment. Funding \nlow cash flow\/coverage ratio SMEs could be beneficial in the medium-run, as these \nfirms could initially use the additional funding for debt repayment rather than \ninvestment, which could provide a platform for greater future investment. \n 21\n \n6. Conclusions \nIn this paper, we have used a panel of mainly unquoted UK firms, operating in a \nbroad range of industrial sectors, to test whether internal and external financial \nconstraints faced by firms have different effects on their sensitivity of investment to \ncash flow. Using data on unquoted firms has provided us with a unique opportunity to \nconstruct measures of financial constraints displaying a wide degree of variation \nacross observations. Instead of using the traditional Q-model of investment in \nestimation, we have used an error-correction specification, which has permitted us to \nby-pass to a certain extent the criticism according to which cash flow might affect \ninvestment, simply because it accounts for investment opportunities, not properly \nmeasured by Q. Furthermore, in addition to analyzing how the sensitivities of \ninvestment to cash flow differ at firms facing different degrees of internal financial \nconstraints on the one hand, and different degrees of external financial constraints, on \nthe other, we have also focused on the effects of various combinations of internal and \nexternal financial constraints on the sensitivities, trying to identify the combinations \nleading to the highest sensitivities. \nAccording to our results, which were generally robust to considering only the \nmanufacturing sector or a broader range of industries, when the sample is split on the \nbasis of the level of internal funds available to the firms, the relationship between \ninvestment and cash flow is U-shaped. On the other hand, the sensitivity of \ninvestment to cash flow tends to increase monotonically with the degree of external \nfinancial constraints faced by firms. These findings suggest that the different \nconclusions reached by FHP (1988) and KZ (1997) about whether higher sensitivities \nof investment to cash flow can be interpreted as evidence that firms are more \nfinancially constrained, are probably due to the different criteria used in their studies \nto partition their sample. Finally, combining the internal with the external financial \nconstraints, we find that the sensitivities are the highest for those externally \nfinancially constrained firms that have a relatively high level of internal funds.  \nAlthough our paper provides a reconciliation for the contradictory findings in \nFHP (1988) and KZ (1999), it does not deal with the other challenges that have been \naddressed in the literature to the hypothesis that a significant coefficient on cash flow \nin an investment reduced form regression can be seen as an indication of the existence \nof financial constraints. Authors such as Alti (2003) and Boyle and Guthrie (2003), \n 22\nfor instance, construct theoretical models respectively showing that unconstrained \nfirms can plausibly exhibit the sensitivities documented in the literature, and that \nfirms facing (by construction) identical constraints can nevertheless exhibit different \nsensitivities due to differences in investment flexibility. The question of whether high \nsensitivities of investment to cash flow can be seen as indicators of financial \nconstraints remains therefore a controversial question, which will undoubtedly \ngenerate future research.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nI wish to thank two anonymous referees, M.
