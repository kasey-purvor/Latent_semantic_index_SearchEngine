As this research demonstrates the importance of appearance and gaze in Brixton, it becomes apparent that in this context at least ethnic and racial labels are often pseudonyms for colour. Skin-colour, not ethnicity or heritage, is often the mark of difference.","cites":null},{"id":17342446,"title":"Lambeth Education Statistics London: London Research Centre London Research Centre","authors":[],"date":"1997","doi":"10.11129\/detail.9783034615143.74","raw":"London Research Centre (1997-8) Lambeth Education Statistics London: London Research Centre London Research Centre (1999) Lambeth Social Statistics London: London Research Centre Metropolitan Police (1998) Crime and Disorder Review.
