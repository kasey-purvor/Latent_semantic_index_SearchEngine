Therefore, the expression of genetic\ninformation can be highly dependent on, and regulated by, nutri-\nents, micronutrients, and phytochemicals found in food. The study\nof how genes and gene products interact with dietary chemicals to\nalter phenotype and, conversely, how genes and their products\nmetabolise nutrients is called nutritional genomics or \u2018nutrige-\nnomics\u2019. Unbalanced diets alter gene\u2013nutrient interactions,\n\u2020 This document is an outgrowth of the Bruce Ames International Symposium on Nutritional Genomics held at the University of California, Davis, CA on 22\u201324 October 2004.\nThe statements and opinions expressed are those of symposium participants and others who are contributing to nutrigenomics or related research fields. The present paper is\nintended to stimulate discussion about the interplay of nutrition and genetics and the potential of nutrigenomics to improve global health.\n* Corresponding author: Dr Jim Kaput, fax \u00fe1 312 829 3357 email jkaput@uic.edu\nAbbreviations: NuGO, European Nutrigenomics Organization; PROGENI, Program for Genetic Interaction; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2005), 94, 623\u2013632 DOI: 10.1079\/BJN20051585\nq The Authors 2005\nthereby increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases. Differ-\nences in allele frequencies and DNA haplotype blocks within and\nbetween human subpopulations, together with the chemical\ncomplexity of food, make the study of nutrient\u2013gene interactions\nhighly complex. Genetic variation and numerous environmental\ninfluences put the study of these interactions beyond the scope\nand expertise of any one researcher, institute or programme.\nAdditionally, systems biology approaches are necessary for ana-\nlysing gene\u2013environment interactions but they require disci-\npline-specific expertise and are expensive. Hence, there is\nconsiderable justification for global sharing of knowledge. In the\npresent paper we provide an overview of the field of nutritional\ngenomics and specific recommendations regarding needs and\nrequirements for methodological advances and comprehensive\nanalyses of nutrient\u2013genotype interactions in populations\nthroughout the world. The need for well-designed experiments\nin model organisms and cell cultures is also discussed. The objec-\ntive of the present paper is to initiate communication and collab-\noration among nutrigenomic researchers and stakeholders around\nthe world. By sharing ideas, best practices, and datasets, we hope\nto identify synergies and create those breakthroughs needed to\ndevelop more effective nutritional interventions and genome-\nbased dietary recommendations. Ultimately, an international con-\nsortium will probably be necessary. We suggest a roadmap for\nachieving this objective. This effort requires participation of\npopulations in many geographically distinct areas of the world.\nWe believe that developing collaborations and exchanging infor-\nmation will have a significant, positive impact on health and\nreduce health disparities in developed and developing countries.\nBackground\nThe shifting balance between health and disease states involves\nthe complex interplay of genes and the environment, which\nincludes diet. Most scientists acknowledge the importance of\nenvironmental influences on the expression of genetic infor-\nmation, yet many human, animal, and cell-culture studies over-\nlook their influences in their experimental designs (Kaput,\n2004). At least two factors contribute to the genome-centric\nview of current experimental strategies. First, in a 2001 report\nsummarising genes known to cause disease, 97 % of 923 genes\nexamined were found to be solely responsible for aberrant pheno-\ntypes (Jimenez-Sanchez et al. 2001). Advances in our understand-\ning of the molecular mechanisms of monogenic diseases have led\nto the implicit, if not explicit, belief that mutations are respon-\nsible. However, even these monogenic diseases can vary in the\nage of onset and in severity, demonstrating that other genetic or\nenvironmental factors influence the expression of the causative\ngene or its mutation. The second factor that contributes to gene-\ncentred research is the tremendous chemical complexity of\nfood. The simplest plant- and animal-derived foods contain hun-\ndreds of chemical constituents, some of which are sources of\nenergy (for example, glucose or certain fatty acids), while\nothers serve as essential nutrients or regulators of cell functions\n(for example, certain fatty acids and phyto-oestrogens such as\ngenistein). Consequently, diet is often overlooked as an important\nvariable in experimental design even though dietary constituents\ncan alter gene expression and\/or gene structure. Two well-docu-\nmented examples of how nutrient\u2013gene interactions can affect\ngene expression are provided by hyperforin and genistein. Hyper-\nforin, the active ingredient in St John\u2019s wort, binds to the ligand\nbinding site of the pregnane X receptor (Watkins et al. 2003) and\ninduces transcription of reporter genes in cell-culture systems\n(Tirona et al. 2004; for a review, see Rebbeck et al. 2004). Gen-\nistein, an isoflavone found in soya beans and other plants, binds to\nthe active site of oestrogen receptor b (Pike et al. 1999) and\ninduces oestrogen-specific gene expression in uteri of rats fed\ngenistein-supplemented food (Naciff et al. 2002). Recent reviews\ndiscuss these and other molecular processes directly affected by\nnutrients and show that nutrient\u2013gene interactions affect health\n(Jacobs & Lewis, 2002; Francis et al. 2003; Gillies, 2003;\nDavis & Milner, 2004; Kaput & Rodriguez, 2004; Simopoulos\n& Ordovas, 2004). Diet\u2013gene interactions are complex and are\nlikely to require large populations for adequate statistical\npower. Resolving experimental design issues that originate from\ncomplexities of gene\u2013environment interactions will probably\nrequire pooling of information from several population groups.\nSuperimposed are technical challenges of clinical data collec-\ntion from individuals of diverse cultures and ecosystems along\nwith the expense of complex phenotypic assessments and geno-\ntype analyses. Nutritional genomics requires a systems biology\napproach, with the methods and technical skills ranging from gen-\notyping (especially single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) anal-\nysis), nutritional epidemiology, microarray analysis, proteomics,\nmetabolomics, bioinformatics, pathology, and diverse clinical\nassessments, in models ranging from cell culture to experimental\nanimals and human populations. Significant numbers of investi-\ngators are developing nutrigenomics programmes in various\ncountries, and each of them will probably face similar problems\nin developing and adapting cutting-edge technologies for high-\ndimensional research efforts. The strategic and technical chal-\nlenges of nutritional genomics justify the sharing of resources\nand knowledge to avoid duplication in developing experimental\ntools, software programs, and computational models.\nNutrition and human genetic diversity\nAlthough there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the\ninfluence of some food constituents on gene activity, nutrige-\nnomics must address how individual genomes respond to the\ncomplex nutrient and chemical mixtures that comprise foods.\nThe sequencing of the human genome laid the foundation for\none of the most significant scientific contributions to humankind\n\u2013 an evidence-based understanding that while human individuals\nare genetically similar, each retains a unique genetic identity\nunderlying the wide array of biochemical, physiological, and mor-\nphological phenotypes in human populations. However, genetic\nvariation produces a continuum for each human trait, thus chal-\nlenging dichotomous social groupings based solely on external\nphenotypes (Keita et al. 2004; Parra et al. 2004). Variation\namong individuals from Africa, Asia, and Europe ranges from\n10 % (analyses of simple tandem repeats) to 14 % (analyses of\nAlu insertion polymorphisms). However, about 86\u201390 % of gen-\netic variation in our species is shared by ancestral groups (Jorde &\nWooding, 2004).\nGenetic variation in populations confounds molecular epide-\nmiology studies that seek to analyse gene\u2013disease or nutrient\u2013\ngene associations. For example, of the 603 gene\u2013disease associ-\nations reported up to 2002, only six have been replicated more\nthan three times (Hirschhorn et al. 2002). Meta-analyses of\ntwenty-five different reported associations (data from 301 pub-\nlished studies) showed statistically significant replication for\nJ. Kaput et al.624\neight gene associations (Lohmueller et al. 2003). Similarly, non-\nreplicated results associating diet with candidate gene variants are\nthe norm (for reviews, see Loktionov et al. 2000; Loktionov,\n2003; Corella & Ordovas, 2004; Ordovas, 2004; Ordovas & Cor-\nella, 2004). In addition to population stratification, other confoun-\nders include sample sizes lacking statistical power,\ninappropriately matched controls, overinterpretation of data\n(Lander & Kruglyak, 1995; Risch, 1997; Cardon & Bell, 2001),\nand the influence of other environmental factors (see later;\np. 629 of proof). There is a growing awareness that epistasis\n(i.e. gene on gene interactions) (Hartman et al. 2001; Moore,\n2003; Carlborg & Haley, 2004), genotype\u2013environment inter-\nactions particularly those involving diet (for reviews, see van\nOmmen & Stierum, 2002; Corella & Ordovas, 2004; Kaput &\nRodriguez, 2004; Ordovas, 2004), and health status (for example,\nStoehr et al. 2000; Lan et al. 2003) may alter associations of SNP\nor sets of SNP with disease processes. A lack of consistency in\nmethods of estimating food composition often precludes compari-\nsons between populations. For example, estimates of dietary fibre\ncontents differ if they are defined and analysed as NSP, or accord-\ning to one of the more recent definitions (for example, Ferguson\n& Harris, 2003; Devries, 2004). The combinations of study design\nissues, complex and interacting molecular processes, and diverse\nenvironmental influences demand a re-evaluation of how biome-\ndical research is conducted.\nGoals and objectives of nutritional genomics research\nThe purpose here is to stimulate communication and collaboration\namong nutrigenomic researchers and stakeholders throughout the\nworld. Stakeholders include representatives from academia,\nindustry, government, and public interest groups. To help identify\nsynergies and create the breakthroughs needed to develop more\neffective nutritional interventions and genome-based dietary rec-\nommendations, we are proposing discussions that will lead to\nsharing ideas, datasets, research results, reagents, samples, and\nbest practices for conducting nutritional genomics research\nunder high scientific standards and in an ethical, socially respon-\nsible, and culturally sensitive manner. The needs that have\nbeen identified for nutritional genomics research are presented\n(Muller & Kersten, 2003; Kaput, 2004; Ordovas & Corella,\n2004).\nData federation\nDevelopment of a scalable database with semantic interoperabil-\nity that will allow sharing anonymised genetic, phenotypic, diet-\nary, nutritional status, and other environmental and cultural\ninformation must have the highest priority. Semantic interoper-\nability will require agreements between independent database\ndevelopers that all systems share common \u2018meanings\u2019 of data\nelements in a way that define a common ontology, mechanisms\nto share common data elements, and a means to \u2018harmonise\u2019 defi-\nnitional disagreements. Several biobanks have developed such\nsystems.\nLarger study populations are needed\nThe statistical power of association studies needs to be increased\nwith common phenotypic measurements and combining results\nfrom many studies. This can be a two-edged sword; in order to\ndetect the subtle effects of gene variants, large numbers of\nstudy participants will be required. However, as the number of\nindividuals in a study increases, the greater the likelihood that\nvariance may be due to differences in environment and population\nstratification. Stratification occurs when individuals within\nthe study population have different genetic architectures, which\narise from their ancestral lineage (for example, African v. Asian\nancestries). Analyses of genetic variance in human populations\nshow a greater variation within populations than between popu-\nlations (for a review, see Jorde & Wooding, 2004). Hence, com-\nbining data from multiple ancestral groups may reveal common\ngenotypes and responses to diet. Stratification may be a confoun-\nder in standard statistical analyses because allele frequencies may\ndiffer between populations (Reich & Goldstein, 2001; Freedman\net al. 2004). Genomic controls, such as analysing mitochondrial\nDNA, Y chromosome, or autosomal (Jorgenson et al. 2005;\nTang et al. 2005) markers in participants, provide a measure of\npopulation stratification. Dimensionality reduction algorithms\nmay identify clustering due to ancestral origins and associations\nwith groups of SNP and dietary composition.\nImproving analyses and consistency of phenotypes\nEarly molecular epidemiology studies attempted to link one SNP\nin a gene to a disease state such as cancer. However, variations in\ndifferent molecular pathways may produce the same phenotype or\ndisease. For example, type 2 diabetes mellitus is currently treated\nby changing diet or exercise habits and\/or by drugs that target\ninsulin secretion from the pancreas, glucose production by the\nliver, glucose absorption by the intestine, or insulin resistance\nby PPAR-targeted drugs in peripheral tissues (American Diabetes\nAssociation, 2005). Patients respond differently to these treat-\nments or their combinations. Molecular epidemiologists include\ndisease markers such as insulin, glucose, and\/or HDL-cholesterol\nconcentrations (rather than diabetes or atherosclerosis alone) to\nidentify \u2018subphenotypes\u2019 of disease. Clinical studies should\ninclude repeated sampling and analyses that assess phenotypes\nmore accurately (Pereira et al. 2004). Since the molecular basis\nfor many diseases is lacking, the greater the number of accurate\nclinical measurements analysed, the more powerful the study.\nSince DNA samples may be shared across studies, common phe-\nnotypes for multiple diseases may be developed and measured\nthat would facilitate measurements across studies. For example,\nserum HDL-cholesterol measurements could also be taken in\nbreast or colon cancer studies.\nCapturing and assessing accurate food intakes\nFood surveys and dietary histories are often inaccurate because of\ndifferences in ability to recall specifics (type and amounts) of\nfood intakes and differences in dietary assessment methods (for\nexample, self-administered v. interviewed; food-frequency ques-\ntionnaires v. diet diaries), and variations in their definitions and\nanalyses. A major emphasis of this international effort will there-\nfore focus on standardising and improving dietary assessment\nmethodologies. Surveys will also have to capture self-described\naffiliations to religions, cultures, customs, or ethnic groups\nbecause of possible food restrictions and preferences. Confir-\nmation of food intakes might also be accomplished by measuring\nplasma micronutrient concentrations, assuming funds were avail-\nable. In addition to accurate food intake information, databases\nThe case for international alliances 625\nare needed on the macro- and micronutrient content of local\nfoods, a challenge for the diverse cultures and diets throughout\nthe world. The FAO of the UN (Food and Agriculture Organiz-\nation, 2005) and various national governments have compiled\nfood composition tables for many countries worldwide, but data\nmust often be extracted from unlinked flat files or from publi-\ncations. A relational database of food composition must be devel-\noped through international collaborations.\nGenomic controls\nMore diverse genetic analyses, that include not only genetic variants\nin nuclear DNA, but also analyses of mitochondrial DNA are needed.\nWhen high throughput methods are further developed, chromosome\nstructure and DNA methylation analyses will also be needed.\nEthical and culturally sensitive recruitment\nEthical and culturally sensitive recruitment of study participants\nfrom diverse cultures (International HapMap Consortium, 2004)\nis needed. Some racial and ethnic populations and the poor\nsuffer disproportionately from chronic diseases and are likely\nstarting populations for nutrigenomic research. However, some\ncultures and populations may be sceptical of molecular and gen-\netics disease research efforts, particularly because of colonial his-\ntories. Addressing the legitimate concerns of these populations\nwill require the input of representatives from diverse communities\nand cultures to develop standards of collaboration and communi-\ncation with study participants. To our knowledge, there are no\nprecedents that allow for data sharing across national borders\nyet protect individuals\u2019 biological information (Austin et al.\n2003; Maschke & Murray, 2004). Hence, among the first tasks\nof the international effort will be to develop protocols for five cat-\negories of ethical, legal, and social issues: study sponsorship and\nbenefit sharing, public engagement, consent, and data protection\n(see Austin et al. 2003). The participation of the international\nnutrigenomic research community in addressing these issues\nmay help facilitate development of regional, national, and inter-\nnational policies for such research. Such efforts are scientifically\njustified because comparative analyses among various ancestral\npopulations with different macro- and micronutrient intake\nlevels may be the critical approach to identify gene\u2013nutrient\ninteractions involved in health and disease. Results from compar-\ning physiological and molecular responses between inbred strains\nof experimental animals fed different defined, reproducible diets\nidentify gene\u2013gene interactions and gene\u2013environment inter-\nactions (for example, Park et al. 1997; Kaput et al. 2004) that\ncannot be revealed in homogeneous or genetically similar popu-\nlations. Comparative analyses of different ancestral groups may\ntherefore reveal common as well as population-specific nutri-\nent\u2013gene interactions (Tai & Tan, 2004).\nCapturing the range of environmental variables\nCapturing the range of environmental variables affecting expression\nof genetic information is an essential component of comprehensive\ngene\u2013environment experiments and analyses. Although our pri-\nmary focus is on nutrient\u2013gene interactions, expression of genetic\ninformation is influenced by numerous environmental factors. For\nexample, cytokine levels are unusually sensitive to environmental\nchanges and serve as good markers of environmental influences\nthat may alter protein and RNA expression. Some examples of\nnon-nutrient environmental factors are:\n1. Overall sleep time and sleep continuity (for example, Red-\nwine et al. 2000; Irwin, 2002);\n2. O2 tension (Prabhakar & Peng, 2004), which is related to\naltitude;\n3. Over-the-counter drugs, for example, non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (Serhan et al. 2000);\n4. Water intake relative to tea (Tomita et al. 2002) and other\nbeverages;\n5. Physical activity, including genetic fitness to activity\n(Nieman et al. 2003a,b, 2004; Gleeson et al. 2004);\n6. Psychological factors such as stress (Irwin et al. 2003);\n7. Exposure to allergens and pollutants (for example, Pandya\net al. 2002);\n8. Circadian rhythm and seasonal changes (Albrecht & Eichele,\n2003);\n9. Balance between energy intake and expenditure (for a\nreview, see Seeley et al. 2004).\nEach added variable may increase the need for larger popu-\nlations since small studies may be unable to discriminate between\nall environmental effects. However, meta-analyses may be poss-\nible if studies record similar data elements for their populations.\nAlthough developing appropriate environmental survey instru-\nments is challenging, a set of guidelines and suggestions would\nfacilitate the development of common data elements for nutrige-\nnomics studies.\nInteractions between academia and industry\nIn the spirit of creating a truly integrated research initiative in\nnutrigenomics, the interaction of partners from agriculture, food\nprocessing, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries with\nacademic centres would accelerate technology development and\ndissemination of nutrigenomic information to the public.\nExamples include the development of new crop varieties with\nenhanced nutritional value, novel food formulations and dietary\nsupplements that promote health and prevent disease, and the\ndevelopment of chip-based diagnostic tests for monitoring\ngenome-specific dietary interventions. An excellent model for\nthis type of interaction is the recently awarded Freedom to\nDiscover grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company to the Pro-\ngram in International Nutrition at the University of California\n(Davis, 2005). The goal of this grant is to explore the implications\nand applications of nutrigenomics and other \u2018omics\u2019 technologies\nin developing countries. Establishing productive and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with industry for societal benefits and\nthe greater good is a goal shared by the members of the nutrige-\nnomics research community. Addressing the issue of revenue\nsharing among stakeholders, particularly study participants, will\nbe a high priority for the international nutrigenomics network.\nOne of many possible concepts is to develop novel agreements\nthat ensure revenue sharing with participants or communities\n(Austin et al. 2003; Maschke & Murray, 2004) and, perhaps\nmore importantly, investments for economic development in\ndeveloping countries (Sachs, 2005).\nIntegration of nutrigenomics research\nNutrigenomic research depends upon robust and reliable methods\nfor discovering candidate genes for association analyses, and\nJ. Kaput et al.626\nresults of epidemiological associations that must be understood at\nthe molecular level. Reliable model systems are essential for the\ndevelopment of an effective and successful international nutrige-\nnomics effort. Examples of model systems that can provide valu-\nable insights into molecular mechanisms underlying nutritional\ngenomics research are now described.\nCell culture\nNutrient interactions have been analysed in model systems\nsuch as glucose deprivation (a model of energy restriction) in\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae (for example, Lin et al. 2002; Lin &\nGuarente, 2003) to human cells exposed to purified phytochem-\nicals (for example, Pianetti et al. 2002) or micronutrients (for\nexample, folate (Kimura et al. 2004). Although genetic variation\nis not typically analysed in such studies, cells in culture allow the\ndissection of molecular pathways influenced by dietary chemicals.\nIdentifying diet-regulated or diet-influenced genes (and their pro-\nducts) using cell cultures allows for the analyses of gene variants\nin human or animal studies.\nAnimal models\nCell cultures do not have livers, microflora in an alimentary tract,\nnor the full metabolic repertoire of their complementary in vivo\ncounterparts. That is, metabolism and regulation of nutrient and\nbioactive components of food are often affected by metabolism\nand products in other organs. Animal studies are often necessary\nto verify the results from cell-culture experiments. A distinct\nadvantage of using animal models is the array of genetically\ndefined mouse strains, the result of a 100-year effort to produce\nand characterise inbred strains for biomedical research (Jackson\nLaboratory, 2005). Laboratory animals are excellent models for\nbiomedical research. Comparative genomic analyses (for\nexample, Linder, 2001) have demonstrated that mice and rats\nshare genes and diseases that are similar in other mammals.\nFor example, 99 % of mouse genes have human homologues\n(Waterston et al. 2002) and obesity-induced diabetes occurs in\nmice (for example, Hribal et al. 2002; Rossmeisl et al. 2003)\nand dogs (Fleeman & Rand, 2001). Molecular responses to\ndietary chemicals can be analysed or compared in strains of\nknown genotypes with differing susceptibility to diet-induced\ndisease, enabling previously unsuspected contributors to the dis-\nease process to be identified (for example, Park et al. 1997;\nKaput et al. 2004). Breeding strategies permit identification of\nepistatic interactions likely to influence gene\u2013disease (Reifsnyder\net al. 2000; Cheverud et al. 2004) and nutrient\u2013gene interactions\n(for example, Cooney et al. 2002). Defined diets, which are repro-\nducible, are critical for diet\u2013gene studies in experimental animals\n(for example, Park et al. 1997; Kaput et al. 2004).\nStudies in humans subjects\nUltimately, candidate genes from cell-culture systems or labora-\ntory animals must be verified in human subjects. The two most\ncommon methods are large-scale molecular epidemiological\nstudies and dietary cross-over trials. Ordovas & Corella (2004)\ncritically reviewed the methodology and progress of molecular\nnutrigenomic epidemiological studies. Although such studies do\nnot prove causality, they provide statistical associations between\ngene variants and disease, subphenotypes of disease, or changes\nin physiology caused by diet. Since statistical association studies\nare based on the analysis of groups or populations, the presence or\nabsence of a particular SNP in an individual may or may not be\nlinked to disease or response to diet. As mentioned previously,\ndietary surveys or histories fail to accurately determine food\nintake. Nevertheless, such association studies provide valuable\ninformation linking genotype to phenotype. It is likely that\npanels of SNP in different genes will be needed to improve the\nprobability that a set of gene variants is associated with a physio-\nlogical process or disease. Randomised double-blind (where poss-\nible) cross-over studies may be of value to confirm the validity of\nnutrigenomics findings reported in genetic epidemiological\nstudies (for example, Dreon et al. 1999).\nModels of scientific consortia\nInterdisciplinary research is being fostered within institutions (Cech\n& Rubin, 2004) and through national and international collabor-\nations. Four of these multi-institutional and national initiatives are\nexamples of collaborative efforts for nutritional genomics research.\nThe Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base,\nalso known as PharmGKB, developed by Stanford University, is\nfunded by the National Institutes of Health and is part of a nation-\nwide collaborative research consortium called the Pharmacoge-\nnetics Research Network (National Institute of General Medical\nServices, 2005; Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowl-\nedge Base, 2005). PharmGKB is building a knowledge base with\naccurate and detailed definitions of genotypes and phenotypes\ninvolved in individual responses to different medications. Data are\ngenerated by the US National Institutes of Health-funded projects in\ntwelve individual laboratories.\nA second collaborative project is the Program for Genetic Inter-\naction (PROGENI; Program for Genetic Interaction, 2005). PRO-\nGENI is the Administrative and Data Coordinating Center for the\n\u2018Interaction of Genes and Environment in Shaping Risk Factors\nfor Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders\u2019 Study. Five separate\nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-funded studies at differ-\nent locations (GET READI, GeneSTAR, GOLDN, GenSALT and\nHAPI Heart) are coordinated through PROGENI, which also\npools data from the centres. Communication between subcommit-\ntees are maintained and core issues shared by all studies are\naddressed through the coordinating activities of the Center. The\nsubcommittees include Recruitment, Protection of Human Sub-\njects\/Data Sharing, Phenotyping, Laboratory\/DNA, Analysis and\nan overarching Steering Committee. A Data Safety Management\nBoard, which is independent of and external to the Center, was\nformed to critique protocols, oversee recruitment goals and\nstudy progress. Biannual analysis workshops are held to bring\ntogether statisticians, and experts in analytic techniques foster\ncross-study collaboration and sharing of methods, tools, and\nsoftware.\nScientists from twenty-two organisations in the European\nUnion have formed the European Nutrigenomics Organization\n(NuGO; www.nugo.org). Approximately 650 scientists belong\nto this organisation with the key objective of development and\npromotion of mechanistic nutrition and health research through\nthe application of \u2018omics\u2019 technologies. This is achieved through\nthe development of joint research programmes and stimulation of\nfacility sharing, facilitating education, communication, commer-\ncialisation, and dissemination of information. Development, data\nwarehousing, and exploitation of nutrition- and health-related\nThe case for international alliances 627\nbioinformatics for European nutrition and nutrigenomics\nresearchers and communities are key issues. The formation of\nNuGO is funded by the European Union. NuGO is fostering col-\nlaborations among members through targeted funding and an\ninteractive website, which hosts discussion groups on subjects\nrelated to nutrigenomics research methods and results.\nA fourth model of a collaborative project is the International\nHapMap project (International HapMap Consortium, 2003, 2004),\nwhich is analysing SNP patterns (haplotypes) of human genetic\nvariations within chromosomal regions. Each haplotype block\nwill be tagged or identified by one or more SNP. A use for this\nresource will be association studies; candidate disease genes are\nfound within haplotype blocks more frequently associated with sub-\nphenotypes of disease (for example, insulin levels or HDL-choles-\nterol concentrations, etc) in individuals with symptoms compared\nwith individuals who are symptom-free. The HapMap Consortium\nconsists of committees dealing with: ethical, legal, and social\nissues; population studies; community engagement and public con-\nsultation; sample collection; genotyping and SNP analysis; SNP dis-\ncovery; scientific management and methods; initial planning\n(International HapMap Consortium, 2004).\nThere are significant differences between these model colla-\nborative projects and nutrigenomics research. Nutrigenomics\nwill require nutritional, cultural, and other environmental data\nthat may influence nutrient\u2013gene interactions. Populations\nlinked to those variables also need to be identified. For example,\nfood intake and activity levels in urban areas may be significantly\ndifferent from those in rural areas. Macro- and micronutrient\nintake levels may vary widely in rural populations because of cus-\ntoms and seasonal availability of different foods. Furthermore,\nallele frequencies may differ between rural and urban populations\nwithin the same country. Although it has been argued that SNP\nassociated with nutrient intakes have low penetrance and are unli-\nkely to be predictive of disease susceptibility (Haga et al. 2003),\nothers contend that combinations of SNP in multiple disease-\nlinked genes will be predictive of a range of susceptibility to\nchronic diseases (for example, Kaput, 2004). Nutrigenomic\nstudies will eventually resolve these conflicts. Nevertheless, the\nidentification of populations and the possibility of discovering\ndisease susceptibilities linked to genes, environment, and their\ninteractions bring into question ethical issues not faced by the\nHapMap project, which seeks mainly to catalogue variations\nrather than to link them with disease susceptibilities. It is our\nview that these ethical issues can be resolved with appropriate\nparticipation of individuals from different ethnicities and cultures\nin conjunction with scientists and ethicists associated with this\nnutrigenomics effort.\nRoadmap\nUltimately, an international consortium will be necessary to effec-\ntively harness the power of a large collaborative network of nutri-\ntional genomics researchers with expertise, samples from\npopulations, experimental models, data, resources, and knowledge\nof environment\u2013gene interactions that affect health. Nutrige-\nnomic initiatives are underway at many institutions and\ncompanies throughout the world, many with disease- or nutri-\nent-specific foci. Hence, we recognise that additional stages of\ncommunication and coordination are necessary for forming the\nworking consortium that harmonises plans and objectives to\navoid unnecessary replication of efforts.\nThe steps (Fig. 1) for developing an international effort for\nnutritional genomics are the identification of researchers and\ngroups who define needs and resources at the local, national,\nand regional efforts. NuGO is an example of a regional organis-\nation that may be emulated by national (for example, USA or\nCanada) or regional efforts (North America or Africa or Asia).\nInterested individuals from these organisations or laboratories\nwould then be organised into committees similar to those devel-\noped for the International HapMap Project. Parallel to this func-\ntional grouping, regional nutrigenomics societies can be\nfounded to functionally stimulate and disseminate the science of\nnutrigenomics. No barriers are foreseen in collaborating with\nother national, regional, or international consortia focusing on\nparallel scientific efforts. An international nutrigenomics consor-\ntium would be a natural outgrowth of the coordinating group.\nThe resulting organisation would then hone goals, seek research\nfunding, develop research projects, educational tools and work-\nshops, coordinate activities such as conference foci and dates,\nand develop common data warehousing (Fig. 1).\nThose of us involved with the development of the Pharmacoge-\nnetics Research Network (R. K.) or of NuGO (B. vO.) emphasise\nthe complexity of establishing strategic alliances at national\n(USA) or regional (European) levels. These organisations required\napproximately 4 years to develop and formalise, with significant\namounts of funding either from the US National Institutes of\nHealth or from the European Union, before reaching their current\nproductive state. International collaborations or the formation of a\nnutrigenomics consortium will require time and funding. Some of\nthe steps that may be necessary are summarised in Fig. 1.\nConclusion\nNutritional genomics is a multi-disciplinary approach for the com-\nprehensive investigation of the influence of diet and individual gen-\netic variation as risk factors for chronic disease. We understand that\ncertain genotypes are more severely affected by specific dietary fac-\ntors than others (no genotype is free from the deleterious effects of\ninadequate diet). Partnerships with academia, industry, and govern-\nment offer hope for identifying and characterising diet-regulated or\nFig. 1. Roadmap to an international nutrigenomics consortium.

Such knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient, to address\nhealth disparities among all racial and ethnic populations through-\nout the world. Social, economic and cultural factors are critical in\nselecting foods and designing studies to identify causative genes\nand interacting environmental factors. A comprehensive nutritional\ngenomics approach will yield short- and long-term benefits to\nhuman health by: (i) revealing novel nutrient\u2013gene interactions;\n(ii) developing new diagnostic tests for adverse responses to diets;\n(iii) identifying specific populations with special nutrient needs;\n(iv) improving the consistency of current definitions and method-\nology related to dietary assessment; (v) providing the information\nfor developing more nutritious plant and animal foods and food for-\nmulations that promote health and prevent, mitigate, or cure disease.\nAchieving these goals will require extensive dialogue between\nscientists and the public about the nutritional needs of the individual\nv. groups, local food availability and customs, analysis and under-\nstanding of genetic differences between individuals and popu-\nlations, and serious commitment of funds from the public and\nprivate sectors. Nutritional genomics researchers are seeking\ncollaborations of scientists, scholars, and policy makers to\nmaximise the collective impact on global poverty and health by\nadvancing our knowledge of how genetics and nutrition can\npromote health or cause disease.\nAcknowledgements\nMany of the authors of the present paper have already contributed\nsignificantly to the field of nutrigenomics, our current understand-\ning of nutrient\u2013gene interactions, and\/or the effects of diet on\nhealth.
