Thixoforming involves processing metallic alloys in the semi-solid state. The process \nrequires the microstructure to be spheroidal when part-solid and part-liquid i.e. to consist of solid \nspheroids surrounded by liquid. The aim of this work was to investigate whether powder \ncompacts can be used as feedstock for thixoforming and whether the consolidating pressure in \nthe thixoformer can be used to remove porosity from the compact. The powder compacts were \nmade from stellite 6 and stellite 21 alloys, cobalt-based alloys widely used for e.g. \nmanufacturing prostheses. Isothermal heat treatments of small samples in the consolidated state \nshowed the optimum thixoforming temperature to be in the range 1340\u02daC-1350\u02daC for both \nmaterials. The alloys were thixoformed into graphite dies and flowed easily to fill the die. \nPorosity in the thixoformed components was lower than in the starting material. Hardness values \nat various positions along the radius of the thixoformed demonstrator component were above the \nspecification for both alloys.  \nKeywords: Thixoforming; semi-solid processing; stellite; powders. \nPACS: 62.20 Fe \nINTRODUCTION \nThe shaping of an alloy in the semi-solid, rather than fully liquid state as in casting, \nor in the fully solid state as in forging, offers many advantages. These include energy \nsavings, reduced die wear and a fine and homogeneous microstructure. Semi-solid \nprocessing utilizes the thixotropic behaviour of alloys in the semi-solid state; provided \nthe microstructure consists of solid spheroids in a liquid matrix it will flow when \nsheared but thicken up again when allowed to stand [1]. Many aluminium and \nmagnesium alloy components are now manufactured commercially by semi-solid \nprocessing. The challenge is to extend the application of the process to a wider range \nof materials including those which require higher temperature treatment and oxidize \nduring reheating, such as the stellites. These are Co-Cr-based alloys which have \nexcellent resistance to many forms of mechanical and chemical degradation over a \nwide temperature range [2]. They are used for a range of applications including power \ngeneration, automotive, aerospace and medical (eg. for prostheses). However, forming \nthese materials into shape (including machining) is difficult because they are hard. \nComponents are generally produced by casting or powder metallurgy. Here we set out \nto investigate whether consolidated and sintered billets can be shaped by \nthixoforming. Previous work using powder based thixoforming feedstock routes has \nconcentrated on Al-based systems eg. 2124Al+SiCp composites from cold compacted \nmechanically alloyed powder [3] and densified hypereutectic Al-Si [4]. Co-Cr alloys \nhave previously been processed by thixoforming using sprayformed feedstock and \nmaterial produced using a deformation\/recrystallisation(RAP) route [5,6] but this \nstudy represents the first using Co-Cr alloy thixoformable feedstock produced from \npowder. \nMATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  \nThe material was produced by spray atomizing followed by consolidation and \nsintering. The powder particle size is <45\u03bcm. Cylindrical slugs (32mm\u03a6x 40mm) of \nstellite 6 (S6) and stellite 21 (S21) alloy were supplied by Deloro Stellite. The melting \nrange for stellite 6 is 1282-1393\u02daC and for stellite 21, 1338-1366\u02daC. The nominal \ncompositions are given in Table 1. Stellite 6 has a high C content and exhibits \nexcellent wear resistance. Stellite 21 has less C and additions of Mo to promote the \nformation of Mo carbides. This leaves more Cr in solution [2], and the material is \nmore suited to applications where corrosion resistance is important. \n \n C Cr Fe Mn Mo Si W Ni Co \nS6 1.15 27.8 3 1 max 1 max 1.15 4.5 - Bal. \nS21 0.25 28 2 max 1 max 5.5 2 max - 2.5 Bal. \nTable 1. Nominal chemical compositions of stellite 6 and stellite 21 (all compositions \nare in wt% unless otherwise stated). \n \n Isothermal heat treatments of the samples were carried out in a vertical tube \nfurnace in air. Samples were held isothermally for 5 minutes and quenched into water. \nThe samples were polished to 0.25\u03bcm colloidal silica and examined optically and with \nimage analysis. Thixoforming was carried out using the 100kN servo-hydraulic \nthixoforming press at the University of Sheffield with an injection velocity of \n500mms-1. The dies were machined in-house from graphite. Reheating to the required \ntemperature was accomplished using induction heating under a shielding atmosphere \nof either nitrogen or argon to avoid excessive oxidation of the surface of the samples \nduring heating to the semi-solid state. The reheating time was ~ 6 minutes. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nMicrostructure of Starting Material and Isothermal Heat Treatments \n \n   The as-received microstructures of S6 and S21 are given in Fig. 1. The porosity \nlevels found using image analysis were ~1 area% for S6 and ~7 area% for the S21. \nBoth microstructures consisted of a primary Co-rich matrix phase (fcc at the \nthixoforming temperature) plus carbide phases which typically consist of M6C, M23C6 \nand\/or M7C3 carbides [7].  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 1.  a) Stellite 6 and b) Stellite 21 in the as-received condition, showing \ndiffering porosity levels. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2. Optical micrographs of the S6 alloy isothermally heat treated for 5 minutes at a) 1330\u02daC, b) \n1340\u02daC, c) 1350\u02daC, d) 1360\u02daC. \n \n  Candidate thixoforming temperatures for the two alloys were 1330-1360\u02daC for S6 \nand 1345-1355\u02daC for S21. Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of S6 at various holding \ntemperatures. At 1330\u02daC, no liquid was present after 5 mins. At 1340\u02daC and above, \nliquid was present and the microstructure evolved to give discrete spheroids \nsurrounded by liquid; the required microstructure for thixoforming. 1340\u02daC was \nselected as the thixoforming temperature as it is generally good practice to thixoform \nat as low a thixoforming temperature as possible whilst still obtaining die filling; this \nminimizes shrinkage effects and die wear. For S21, all the heat treatment temperatures \nproduced spheroidal solid particles with contiguous liquid but there was less liquid \na \n200\u03bcm 50\u03bcm \nb \n100\u03bcm \nc \n200\u03bcm \nd \n200\u03bcm 200\u03bcm \na b \n100\u03bcm \nc \npresent than in the S6 samples. This arises because of the reduced carbon content and \ntherefore the reduced amount of eutectic (which forms liquid). A thixoforming \ntemperature of 1350\u02daC was selected for this alloy. \n \nHeating Schedule Trials and Thixoforming \n \n   For the S6 alloy, a simple disc shaped die cavity was used with changes in section \nand sharp corners to indicate the ability of the semi-solid material to fill the die. The \ndie machining marks were reproduced in the outer ring of the component as shown in \nFig. 3, indicating the potential to produce complex shapes using this technique. There \nwas oxide present on the surface despite the use of cover gas. In industrial practice, \ntechniques have been established to remove this by skimming the surface as the \nmaterial enters the die.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 3. a) Appearance of three of the S6 thixoformed components and b) Image of the outer ring of \nthe component showing that the machining marks on the die surface have been reproduced. \n \n   The microstructures in the thixoformed component at the centre, mid-radius and \nedge of the component are shown in Fig. 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 4. Unetched optical microstructures of \nthe S6 thixoformed demonstrator component at a) \nthe edge, b) mid-radius and c) centre positions \nrespectively.  There is a variation in liquid \nbetween the centre and edge, and evidence of \nmuch reduced porosity relative to the feedstock \nmaterial. \n \n \nMore liquid is evident at the edge. This arises from the non-uniform microstructure in \nthe partially remelted slug prior to thixoforming. The heating schedule could be \na b \na \n100\u03bcm \nb \n100\u03bcm \nrefined to reduce this variation and hence inhomogeneities in the final component. The \ncarbides present in the starting material (Fig. 1) may have reprecipitated but in a form \ntoo fine to be resolvable with optical microscopy at these magnifications. The \nthixoforming has not had a deleterious effect on the hardness as will be shown later. \nThe porosity level in the thixoformed component taken at five positions along the \nsample radius and determined by image analysis was approximately 0.2 area%. This \nindicated that thixoforming was effective in virtually eliminating the porosity present \nin the feedstock material. \n  For S21, a star-shaped component with several protrusions, sharp corners and \nchanges in section was produced. The microstructure was more uniform than for the \nS6 demonstrator (Fig. 5).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 5.

Appearance of the S21 thixoformed \ncomponent. \n \nThis was due to the relative uniformity of \nthe microstructure in the slug prior to \nforming as shown in Fig 5. The component \nis shown in Fig. 6. The porosity levels in the \nthixoformed component were ~1.75 area% \nat the edge, 0.75 area% at the mid-radius \nposition and between 1 and 7 area% at the \ncentre. The relatively high levels were \nassociated with regions where the material had not flowed laterally.

Hardness values in the thixoformed S6 \nmaterial ranged between 43-46 Rc. This compares with a specification value of 39-43 \nRc. For S21, the range was 38-41Rc compared with a specification of 30-35 Rc.   \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n   Thixoformable feedstock can be produced from atomized and consolidated powders \nof the high temperature Co-Cr alloys Stellite 6 and Stellite 21. Thixoforming \ntemperatures were 1340\u02daC for S6 and 1350\u02daC for S21. Demonstrator components were \nproduced using graphite dies and heating to the semi-solid state in ~ 6 minutes. The \nmicrostructures exhibited variations in the liquid content from the centre of the \ncomponent to the edge. Porosity in the S6 components was approximately 0.2 area%, \nindicating that thixoforming had been effective in virtually eliminating the porosity \npresent in the sintered feedstock. Porosity in the S21 thixoformed component was \ngreater, but only in regions where lateral flow of the semi-solid slurry had not \noccurred. The hardness values taken at various locations in the components were 43-\n46 Rc for the S6 alloy and 38-41 Rc for the S21 alloy. These values are above the \nspecification for this alloy. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n   Thanks are due to Deloro Stellite for the provision of material, to Dr Danie de Wet \nand Dr Jim Wu of Deloro Stellite for their support and helpful discussions, and to the \nDepartment of Engineering Materials at the University of Sheffield for the provision \nof laboratory facilities. \nREFERENCES \n1.
