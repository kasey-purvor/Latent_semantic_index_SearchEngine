Its characteristic features are identified and discussed on the basis of linear\nresponse theory and the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In common with conventional\nSR (in bistable systems), sharp increases in the response to a weak periodic force, and\nin the signal\/noise ratio, occur with increasing intensity of external noise (temperature)\nwithin a certain range. Unlike conventional SR, however, the dependence of the response\non frequency is strongly resonant.\nICP Numbers: 0540, 0250, 0690\n1Permanent address: Institute of Semiconductors, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev, Ukraine.\n1\nThe physical mechanism underlying stochastic resonance (SR) [1-3], in which a weak peri-\nodic signal can be optimally amplified by the introduction of external noise of appropriate\nintensity, is usually assumed to involve fluctuational transitions between the coexisting\nattractors of systems with double-well (or multi-well) static potentials. We shall refer to\nphenomena arising through this mechanism as conventional SR. Numerous examples have\nbeen found [4] in physics, engineering and biology, as well as in geophysics [2, 3]. The\ntheory of conventional SR has been developed both in terms of Fokker-Planck approxi-\nmations [5-9] and also through the application of linear response theory (LRT) and the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem [10, 11].\nRecently, it has become apparent that SR is actually a much more general phenomenon\nthan had previously been supposed. In particular, it has been shown [12] that significant\nstochastic enhancements of weak periodic signals can also occur, under appropriate con-\nditions, in underdamped monostable systems. The most pronounced enhancements oc-\ncurred for a system having an extremum in the dependence of its eigenfrequency upon en-\nergy \u03c9(E), as sketched in Fig 1. They were observed when the frequency \u2126 of the periodic\nforce applied to the system (the signal) was close to the extremal frequency \u03c9m = \u03c9(Em)\nat which the dispersion [d\u03c9(E)\/dE]E=Em was equal to zero, and the phenomenon was\nconsequently referred to as zero-dispersion stochastic resonance (ZDSR). In this Letter\nwe identify and discuss the characteristic features of ZDSR, the ways in which it differs\nfrom conventional SR and, in particular, the extent to which noise-induced enhancements\nof the signal\/noise ratio may be anticipated. We first consider the phenomenon in relation\nto a general one-dimensional underdamped oscillator with coordinate q(t),\nq\u00a8 + 2\u0393q\u02d9 +\ndU(q)\ndq\n= f(t) + A cos \u2126t (1)\n\u0393\u001c 1, \u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0\n\u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 4\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032)\nwhere f(t) is white Gaussian noise of zero mean and intensity T , \u0393 is the damping constant\nwhich is assumed small, and A cos \u2126t is the weak periodic signal whose enhancement will\noccur under SR conditions. The only restriction placed on the potential U(q) at this stage\nis that it should be such that \u03c9(E) will possess at least one extremum, as discussed above.\nAfter discussing ZDSR in quite general terms, applicable to any oscillator of this type,\nwe will consider in detail a particular archetypal example of such a system, the tilted\nsingle-well Duffing oscillator.\nThe physical origins of ZDSR can be understood qualitatively in terms of two distinct\nbut linked considerations. First, it is possible for the response to the periodic force to\nbecome substantial, even at a frequency \u2126 ' \u03c9m different from the oscillator\u2019s natural\n(E \u2192 0) frequency \u03c90, if the system is \u201ctuned\u201d by the introduction of external noise\nof appropriate intensity T (or equivalently by raising the temperature) such that the\nprobability \u221d e\u2212Em\/T of its reaching energy Em becomes significant. The response may\ntherefore be expected to increase rapidly with increasing T . Secondly, and of central\nimportance for this Letter, the lack of dispersion near \u03c9m means that fluctuations in\nthe energy of the system will exert only a minimal disruptive influence on the resonance\n(because the resonant frequency is then virtually energy-independent).\n2\n<Jm - -- - -- - ---__.-'!~ I _, __ _ \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nFig. 1 \nw \n3 - -\u00b7\"'\"\" --1 \n~-----____JI \nE \nFigure 1: Sketch to illustrate the variation of eigenfrequency \u03c9(E) with energy E typical of\nthe class of oscillators considered. The eigenfrequency has a minimum value \u03c9m \u2261 \u03c9(Em)\nat energy Em. The inset shows a zero-dispersion spectral peak (the sharp spike) appearing\nin the fluctuation spectrum of the system (1), (11) with B = 2, 2\u0393 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123, T =\n0.485 measured in the absence of the periodic force (A = 0) using an electronic analogue\nsimulator [19].\nProvided that the periodic force is weak, a quantitative description of SR in quasi-\nthermal equilibrium systems can be developed on the basis of LRT and the fluctuation\ndissipation theorem [10-12]. We suppose that the ensemble-averaged response of the\nsystem to a weak periodic force A cos \u2126t can be characterized by a susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126), so\nthat\n\u3008q(t)\u3009 = ARe[\u03c7(\u2126)e\u2212i\u2126t] (2)\nwhere \u03c7(\u2126) can [13] in turn be expressed in terms of the fluctuation dissipation theorem\n[14],\nRe\u03c7(\u2126) =\n2\nT\nP\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03c91[\u03c9\n2\n1\/(\u03c9\n2\n1 \u2212 \u21262)]Q0(\u03c91) (3)\nIm\u03c7(\u2126) = (pi\u2126\/T )Q0(\u2126) (4)\nHere, P implies the Cauchy principal part and\nQ0(\u03c9) \u2261 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndte\u2212i\u03c9t\u3008q(t)q(0)\u3009 (5)\n3\nis the spectral density of the fluctuations (SDF) of the system in the absence of the periodic\nforce. It has been suggested [12, 15] that SR-like phenomena are to be anticipated in any\nphysical system where Q0(\u03c9) possesses one or more sharp peaks that increase rapidly with\nincreasing T . Accordingly, we suppose that Q0(\u03c9) has a high, narrow, maximum at some\nfrequency \u03c9m. (If the potential resembles that sketched in Fig 1, \u03c9m will correspond, as\nabove, to the extremal frequency at E = Em.) Thus we can write\nQ0(\u03c9) = Qpeak(\u03c9) +Qfar(\u03c9) (6)\nwhere Qpeak(\u03c9) has a maximum of magnitude Qm at \u03c9m whose width \u2206\u03c9 \u001c \u03c9m. We\nsuppose Qfar(\u03c9) to be negligible at \u03c9m, but that it may still be substantial at frequencies\nsituated far from \u03c9m in comparison to \u2206\u03c9. If the signal frequency \u2126 ' \u03c9m, the contri-\nbutions to Re [\u03c7(\u2126)], i.e. to the integral in (3), from frequencies close to \u03c9m (i.e. for\n|\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9m| <\u223c \u2206\u03c9) and those far from it are respectively\nFclose \u223c 1\nT\n\u03c9m\ndQ\nd\u03c9\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2126'\u03c9m\n\u2206\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9mQm\nT\n(7)\nFfar \u223c 1\nT\n\u03c92f\n|\u03c92f \u2212 \u03c92m|\nSf (8)\nwhere Sf =\n\u222b\nd\u03c9Qfar(\u03c9) is the area under the far part of the SDF Qfar(\u03c9), and \u03c9f lies\nwithin the range of the maximum of Qfar(\u03c9). If Qfar(\u03c9) has several well-defined maxima,\nFfar should be a sum of analogous terms for each maximum.\nIt can be seen from (7), (8) that the contribution to the real part of the susceptibility\nfrom frequencies close to \u03c9m does not depend on the width \u2206\u03c9 of the peak Qpeak(\u03c9)\nand that, if the maximum Qm of this peak is high enough, then this contribution will\ndominate. Correspondingly, given (4) that Im [\u03c7(\u2126 ' \u03c9m)] \u223c Qm\u03c9m\/T , the absolute\nmagnitude of the response at \u2126 ' \u03c9m is given by\n|\u03c7(\u2126)| =\n\u221a\n[Re{\u03c7(\u2126)}]2 + [Im{\u03c7(\u2126)}]2 \u223c Qm\u03c9m\nT\n(9)\nIf Qm increases rapidly with T , then the response of the system to a weak periodic force\nA cos \u2126t of frequency \u2126 close to \u03c9m will also increase rapidly with T . Within the linear\nresponse regime, where the signal\/noise ratio [10, 11] is given by\nR =\n1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2\/Q0(\u2126) (10)\nit is clearly possible for R to rise with increasing T provided only that the increase in\n|\u03c7(\u2126)|2 with T is sufficiently rapid (i.e. faster than that of Q0(\u2126)). In the present case,\nwhere we assume that the height Qm of the narrow peak in the SDF at \u03c9m increases very\nrapidly with T , (9) and (10) clearly demonstrate that stochastic resonance in R is to be\nexpected.\nThus, in the LRT picture, the occurrence of ZDSR stems from the extremely narrow\nzero dispersion peaks (ZDPs) [16] that arise in the spectral density of the fluctuations of\nthe noise-driven underdamped oscillator (in the absence of the periodic force) whenever\nthe form of \u03c9(E) has an extremum. For the sake of definiteness, we now consider a\nparticular system of this type, namely the tilted single-well Duffing oscillator, for which\nthe potential function is\n4\n0 0 \n0 L{) \nFig. 2 \nl r\u00b7 \n~\n \n\u00b7~1 \n.\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n \n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n \nI \nFigure 2: The signal\/noise ratio R for the system (1) (11), calculated from (3)-(5) and\n(10) for different values of \u0393 where Q0(\u03c9) in the absence of the periodic force (A = 0)\nwas obtained on the basis of the method given in [17]. The value of \u2126 has been chosen\nin each case to correspond to the maximum of the ZDP. The curves plot R as a function\nof noise intensity T for: (a) 2\u0393 = 10\u22124, \u2126 = 1.794; (b) 2\u0393 = 10\u22123, \u2126 = 1.798; (c) 2\u0393 =\n10\u22122, \u2126 = 1.816; (d) 2\u0393 = 10\u22121, \u2126 = 1.846.\nU(q) =\n1\n2\nq2 +\n1\n4\nq4 +Bq (11)\nIn the absence of damping, and with no noise or periodic force, the dependence of the\nfrequency \u03c9(E) of conservative vibrations on the energy E = 1\n2\nq\u02d92 + U(q) possesses a\nminimum [17], of the form sketched in Fig 1, provided that the modulus of the tilt\nparameter |B| > 8\/(7) 32 ' 0.43. Correspondingly, a ZDP may be expected to arise at\nthe extremal frequency \u03c9m in the fluctuation spectrum of the underdamped oscillator (1),\n(11) with A = 0, provided that the noise intensity exceeds some critical value, Tc \u001c Em\n[18]. For small enough \u0393 the shape of the ZDP is universal, its width \u2206\u03c9 \u221d \u0393 12 and its\nmagnitude [16, 18] is\nQZDP (\u2126) = CsS(\n\u2126\u2212 \u03c9m\n\u2206\u03c9sgn[d2\u03c9(Em)\/dE2]\n) (12)\nwhere S is a universal function and the scaling factor Cs \u221d \u0393\u2212 14 exp(\u2212Em\/T ). The ZDP\nfor (1), (11) has recently been observed [19] in analogue electronic experiments (see Fig 1\ninset) and found to rise extremely rapidly (exponentially) with increasing T , in excellent\nagreement with the theoretical predictions [16, 18].\n5\n0 \n\u2022\n \n.\n.\n-\n-\n~\n \nI I \nLO \u2022 \n0 0 0 0 0 \n~\n \nCX) \u2022 \n.\n.\n-\n-a\n \n0 \n_\n_\n.L\n. \nCX) \u2022 \n.\n.\n-\n-\n(() \n\"\"\" \no\n\u00b7\n \n.\n ..\n-\n-\n0 \n0 0 0 \nFig. 3 \n~\n \n.0\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n_\n, \n0 0 \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \n' \nN\n \n~\n \n0 \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n_\n, \n~\n \n~\n \nFigure 3: Demonstration of the sensitivity of ZDSR to small changes in the frequency \u2126\nof the periodic force.

The inset plots the SR magnitude parameter M directly as a function of \u2126 for 2\u0393\n= 10\u22124.\nIt is evident, therefore, that the system (1), (11) with |B| > 0.43 meets all the condi-\ntions required for the occurrence of ZDSR: in particular, an increase of R with increasing\nT , as well as of |\u03c7(\u2126)|, is to be anticipated. In order to provide a quantitative descrip-\ntion on the basis of (3)-(5) and (10), all that we need is the fluctuation spectrum Q0(\u03c9)\nof the system in the absence of the periodic force (A = 0), which can readily be found\nnumerically using the method given in [17].\nSome results of such calculations are shown in Figs 2-4. Figs 2 plots the signal\/noise\nratio R as a function of noise intensity T for different values of the damping constant \u0393.\nIt is immediately evident that, for large \u0393 as in curve (d), R decreases monotonically with\nincreasing T . For smaller \u0393 where the ZDP is more pronounced through Cs in (12), on the\nother hand, there is a range of T for which R increases markedly with increasing T , i.e. a\nstrong manifestation of the ZDSR phenomenon is seen for R, not just for the response as\nobserved [12] previously. The general shape of R(T ), with a rapid rise followed by a slower\ndecrease as T is increased, is similar to that seen in conventional SR [1, 4, 5]. It is clear\nthat the magnitude of the ZDSR increase of R rises as \u0393 becomes smaller (\u221d \u0393\u2212 14 ), just\nas expected on the basis of the simple arguments presented above. It may conveniently\nbe characterized in terms of the ratio of the local maximum and local minimum values of\nR(T ),\nM = ln(Rmax\/Rmin) (13)\n6\n0 N \nI\n~\n \nl \n0 \n0 \nFig. 4 \nN\n \nCX) \u2022 \n0 CX) \u2022 \nCX) \n\"' \u2022 \nFigure 4: Illustration of the strongly resonant behaviour characteristic of ZDSR. The\ncalculated response |\u03c7| for the system (1), (11) is plotted directly as a function of the\nfrequency \u2126 of the periodic force with 2\u0393 = 10\u22124 for three different noise intensities: (a)\nT = 0.8; (b) T = 0.4; (c) T = 0.2. Note the highly expanded abscissa scale.\nwhere we set M = 0 when, as e.g. in curve (d), R(T ) is monotonic.\nIt is interesting to compare ZDSR with conventional SR. One of the most marked\ndifferences is that ZDSR is a strongly resonant phenomenon. Unless the frequency \u2126 of\nthe periodic force is very close to \u03c9m, M = 0 i.e. ZDSR does not manifest itself for R. Fig\n3 shows the effect of small changes in \u2126 for 2\u0393 = 10\u22124 and it is evident that a change of\n\u00b1 0.6% in \u2126 is enough to eliminate the phenomenon completely; the inset shows how the\nparameter M varies with \u2126. The modulus of the susceptibility |\u03c7|, which determines the\nresponse amplitude through (2), is plotted against \u2126 (with a highly expanded abscissa\nscale) for three values of T in Fig 4, demonstrating the resonant character of ZDSR\nexplicitly. This behaviour is in striking contrast to that seen in conventional SR, where\nthe response decreases slowly and monotonically with increasing \u2126 [5]. For the particular\nsystem (1), (11) and values of \u0393 considered in the present work, the maximum value of\nthe signal\/noise enhancement parameter, M = 0.86 for 2\u0393 = 10\u22124, was considerably less\nthan the best results (M ' 2.8) achieved in conventional SR [4]; but there is, of course,\nno limit in principle to the magnitude of M attainable in ZDSR by making \u0393 smaller.\nIn conclusion we would emphasize that the phenomenon of ZDSR, whose characteris-\ntic features are discussed above, is in no way confined to the particular model (1), (11)\nconsidered. Rather, ZDSR is a quite general phenomenon to be anticipated in all under-\ndamped oscillators for which the dependence of eigenfrequency on energy possesses one\nor more extrema [16, 18] including, for example, superconducting quantum interference\ndevices (SQUIDs) [20].\n7\nWe freely and warmly acknowledge our substantial indebtedness to Mark Dykman\nwhose highly original perception of SR provided us with the tools needed to develop this\nwork.
