INTRODUCTION\nTo date, many regions of highly deformed or superde-\nformed nuclei have been established throughout the nuclear\nchart [1]. These collective rotational bands are based upon\nthe occupation of so-called intruder orbit configurations. The\nintruder orbits have a large component of nuclear spin on the\nintrinsic body-fixed rotational axis of the nucleus and their\nexcitation energy, relative to the Fermi level, decreases rap-\nidly with increasing deformation and\/or rotational frequency.\nAs these intruder orbits descend toward the Fermi surface\nthey help create shell gaps. The extra stability of these gaps\nis known to contribute to the stabilization of axially symmet-\nric superdeformed nuclear shapes [2].\nOne of the successes of nuclear theory has been its ability\nto explain why a nucleus can assume a variety of shapes and\neven to predict where in the nuclear chart these different\nshapes would occur. Most of these shapes have predomi-\nnantly been axially symmetric in nature, although this is not\nalways the case. For example, recent evidence has been pro-\nposed that triaxial superdeformed (TSD) bands are based on\nthe development of single-particle triaxial shell gaps in non-\naxially-deformed nuclei [3]. The localization of these shell\ngaps through experimental evidence, therefore, provides im-\nportant information about the deformation driving intruder\norbitals.\nIn the past, establishing the presence of triaxial structures\nhas proved experimentally difficult. In spite of this, nuclear\ntriaxiality has been invoked to describe various phenomena,\nfor example, anomalous signature splittings [4] and inver-\nsions [5] and chiral twin bands [6,7]. A triaxial nucleus has\nmoments of inertia that differ about all three of the intrinsic\nbody-fixed axes. Such triaxial shapes allow a phenomenon\nknown as the wobbling mode to occur [8]. In this wobbling\nmode, the resulting rotational bands have the same basic ro-\ntational structure as regular collective rotational bands about\nthe axis with the largest moment of inertia. However, wob-\nbling bands have additional quanta of rotation about the\nother body-fixed axes. The main theoretical difficulties have\nbeen in predicting the exact locations of these shell gaps. In\n1985 triaxial superdeformed bands were postulated in Ref.\n[9] and later discovered in 71\n163Lu [10]. Direct evidence that\nthese bands in 71\n163Lu were indeed triaxial resulted from the\nobservation of the wobbling mode [10]. In this case the prop-\nerties of the electromagnetic transitions associated with the\nwobbling mode were in agreement with theoretical values\nbased on the particle-rotor model [10].\n*Present address: Department of Physics, United States Naval\nAcademy, Annapolis, MD 21402, USA.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 054314 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/70(5)\/054314(8)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 054314-1\nIn an attempt to understand the triaxial superdeformed\nbands in the Lu nuclei, Schnack-Petersen et al. [3] carried\nout a series of ULTIMATE CRANKER calculations [11\u201313].\nThese authors concluded that the N=94 shell gap was re-\nsponsible for stabilizing the triaxial structures in the mass\n160 region. However, the calculations suggested that the tri-\naxial shapes in 71\n163Lu are not unique and that similar struc-\ntures are likely to occur in other nuclei in the A<165 region.\nTo date, TSD bands have been established in the (odd-Z) Lu\nisotopes 161Lu, 162Lu [14], 163Lu [3,10,15\u201317], 164Lu [18],\n165Lu [3,19,20], and 167Lu [21,22]. Attempts to find TSD\nbands in the even-Z nuclei have, however, had mixed results.\nThe predicted bands in 164Hf and 166Hf have not been dis-\ncovered, but candidate TSD bands were found in the heavier\nmass nuclei 168Hf [23], 170Hf [24], and 174Hf [25]; however,\nno evidence for the wobbling mode has been established,\nthus far.\nIn this work we present the first evidence for highly de-\nformed bands in an even-Z, odd-A hafnium nucleus, 175Hf103.\nTransitions observed in the new bands have regular g ray\nenergy spacings of <59 keV and these bands are linked into\nthe known lower-spin level scheme yielding firm spin and\nparity assignments up to spin 123\/2. One of these new bands\nis isospectral to the candidate triaxial superdeformed band 1\nin 174Hf [25]. In order to understand these bands, a series of\ntheoretical calculations have been performed based on the\nULTIMATE CRANKER code. These calculations predict the ex-\nistence of triaxial superdeformed shell gaps with g\u00f815\u00b0 for\nN=100 and 106 which survive to high spin [25]. However,\nbecause the new bands are firmly linked into the known\n175Hf level scheme, the present data show discrepancies\nwhen compared with the theoretical results which may not\nhave been evident without this additional information. These\ndiscrepancies, and the nonobservation of wobbling bands,\nsuggest that the newly identified highly deformed bands in\nthe Hf nuclei (170Hf [24], 168Hf [23], and 174Hf [25]) may not\nbe based on triaxial-deformed states like those of the Lu\nisotopes in the slightly lighter mass 160 region.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nHigh-spin states in 175Hf were populated with the\n130Tes48Ca,3nd reaction at a beam energy of 194 MeV. A\nthin <0.5-mg\/cm2 target of enriched 130Te deposited on a\n<0.2-mg\/cm2 Au backing was used with the beam entering\nthrough the gold layer. The 48Ca beam was provided by the\nAtlas facility at the Argonne National Laboratory and the g\nrays were detected with the 101 Compton suppressed Ge\ndetectors of the Gammasphere array [26]. The primary aim\nof the experiment was the observation of rotational levels\nabove high-K isomers in 175Hf and therefore the trigger con-\ndition required the presence of three or more suppressed de-\ntectors in prompt coincidence. In approximately one day of\nbeam time <5.53108 events of multiplicity \u00f83 were re-\ncorded. The data were sorted into a four-dimensional (4D)\nenergy cube and analyzed using the RADWARE package [27].\nGated 2D matrices were also created to obtain cleaner sub-\nsets of the data with coincidence gates placed on either high-\nor low-K transitions.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe low-spin structure of 175Hf, including several high-K\nbands, is well established [28\u201331]. (K is the projection of the\nintrinsic nuclear spin onto the nuclear symmetry axis.) In\ntheir analysis with the Tessa3 array, Gj\u00f8rup et al. [29] found\nevidence for two regular rotational bands which they were\nunable to assign to a specific Hf isotope. In the present work,\nthe same reaction as Gj\u00f8rup et al. [29] has been employed;\nhowever, the use of the Gammasphere spectrometer has re-\nsulted in a data set with much higher statistics. Analysis of\nthis data set has allowed these rotational bands to be fully\nestablished and linked into the known level scheme of 175Hf.\nFigure 1 presents the 175Hf partial level scheme associated\nwith these bands.\nFigure 2(a) is a result of a sum of double-coincidence\ngates taken from the 4D cube, containing the five lowest\nclean transitions from band 1 (658, 717, 776, 895, and\n953 keV) with either the 365- or 448-keV transitions from\nthe 7\/2+ f633g band. The spectrum shows the two sequences\nof collective transitions, band 1 (filled circles) and band 2\n(open circles), and the 7\/2+ f633g band (open triangles) up to\nspin 41\/2\" and the 1\/2\u2212 f521g band (filled squares) up to\nspin 43\/2\". Figure 2(b) is a sum of double gates from the 4D\ncube gated on the five lowest clean transitions from band 1\nwith the 221-keV g ray which depopulates the\nKp=23\/2\u2212 band (down triangles) (see Fig. 1). Transitions in\nthis high-K band are also fed by the decay of these new\nbands up to a maximum spin of 41\/2\". The high-spin exten-\nsion of the Kp=23\/2\u2212 band is the subject of a forthcoming\narticle [28]. The inset to Fig. 2(b) provides a high-energy\nspectrum of the top of band 2, from a sum of triple gates\nfrom the 4D cube (one of 658-, 717-, 775-, 894-, and\n952-keV g rays with two g rays from the 863-, 915-, 968-,\n1025-, 1084- and 1144-keV transitions). Both Figs. 2(a) and\n2(b) display a number of additional transitions which result\nfrom the decay of these bands. These g rays have been iden-\ntified in this work as linking transitions from band 1 to (i) the\n1\/2\u2212 f521g band, (ii) the 7\/2+ f633g band, and (iii) the Kp\n=23\/2\u2212 band, (see Fig. 1). Figures 3(a) and 3(b) present\nsums of triple-gated spectra which demonstrate the coinci-\ndence relations of the new g rays connecting bands 1 and 2.\nThese triple gates are formed from the (717-, 776-,\n836-keV gates) with the (895-, 953-, 1008-keV gates) and\neither the 812-keV [Fig. 3(a)] or the 819-keV [Fig. 3(b)]\ntransitions, respectively. The absence of the 1051-keV g ray\nfrom Fig. 3(a) demonstrates that the 812- and 1051-keV\ng rays are not in coincidence with each other and take\nmutually exclusive decay routes. Similarly, in Fig. 3(b), the\n1058-keV g ray is absent which demonstrates that it is not in\nmutual coincidence with the 819-keV transition. These rela-\ntions and g-ray intensities were used to construct the partial\nlevel scheme for 175Hf (see Fig. 1).\nThe multipolarity of the transitions was obtained, where\npossible, using the method of directional correlation of ori-\nented states (DCO) [32]. DCO ratios sRDCOd were calculated\nfrom\nD. T. SCHOLES et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 054314 (2004)\n054314-2\nFIG. 1.

These DCO ratios were then\nused to deduce the spins of the states. A DCO ratio of 1.0 in\nan E2-gated spectrum was interpreted as indicating that the\nunknown transition was of stretched E2 character, whereas a\nratio of 0.5 was taken to correspond to a stretched DI=1\ntransition. These values were checked by measuring DCO\nratios for some known transitions in the normal deformed\n7\/2+ f633g band in 175Hf. Table I gives the energies, inten-\nsities, DCO ratios, and assignments for bands 1 and 2 along\nwith some established transitions [29].\nFor bands 1 and 2, the DCO ratios were measured from\ngates within the bands and assume that the 717-keV g ray is\nan E2 transition, which is likely given its position in the\nregular spacing of the energy levels. Under this assumption,\nthe DCO analysis of the new g rays shows that most are\nconsistent with the behavior expected for E2 transitions. In\ncontrast, the 1170- and 1194-keV transitions, which are in-\nvolved in the decay of band 1 to the 7\/2+ f633g band through\nsome intermediate states in the 1\/2\u2212 f521g band, have DCO\nratios which suggest they are dipole in nature and are con-\nsistent with stretched-E1 transitions. These transitions fix the\nspin and parity of the 3726-keV state in band 1 to be 31\/2\u2212.\nIn agreement, two-state mixing is observed between the 1\/2\u2212\nf521g band and band 1 (see below), which is consistent with\nthe DCO analysis in fixing the negative parity of band 1 to\nbe the same as that of the 1\/2\u2212 f521g band.\nThe spin and parity assignments for band 2 were deduced\nin a similar manner. The DCO ratios for the 812- and\n819-keV transitions reveal that they are stretched-E2 transi-\ntions. This fixes the parity of band 2 to be negative and the\n12 681-keV state to be 79\/2\u2212. This assignment is consistent\nwith the fact that the 79\/2\u2212 state in band 1 is established to\nbe only 7 keV different in excitation energy from that of a\n79\/2\u2212 state in band 2 (see Fig. 1). These states mix (with a\nweak interaction strength of <2.5 keV) and this reveals that\nthe spin and parity for bands 1 and 2 must be identical at the\n79\/2\u2212 level. In summary, this DCO analysis has allowed the\nspins and parties of the so-called TSD bands to be firmly\nestablished for the first time in the hafnium nuclei.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe mid-shell-mass 170\u2013180 nuclei are well known for\ntheir multiquasiparticle excitations based on high-K orbitals\n[33]. At low to moderate spins, these high-K states are built\nupon prolate-deformed configurations with axial symmetry.\nAt higher spins, recent calculations have shown that the in-\ntruder i13\/2 proton orbit, and the j15\/2 neutron orbit originating\nfrom above the N=126 shell gap, may become occupied in,\nfor example, 174Hf [25]. The occupation of such orbitals is\nexpected to produce nuclear states with considerable defor-\nmation. At these high spins, the calculations also suggest that\nthe hafnium nuclei become susceptible to triaxial deforma-\ntion. Recently, evidence has been presented for several de-\nformed rotational bands based on such nonaxial nuclear\nshapes in 168Hf [23], 170Hf [24], and 174Hf [25]. Unfortu-\nnately, unambiguous spins and parities could not be assigned\nto these bands because they were not linked into the known\nlower-spin level schemes. As such, comparisons with theo-\nretical calculations to assign underlying single-particle con-\nfigurations have been difficult.\nFIG. 2. Double-gated spectra from the 4D cube.

This reference term\nremoves the collective contribution to the excitation energy.\nFigure 4 indicates that the new band 2 (open circles) in\n175Hf is yrast at high spin and thereby dominates the popu-\nlation intensity at this point. Band 2 has a large slope because\nof its large aligned angular momentum (see below). No other\nbands compete for this decay intensity until spin <79\/2\"\nwhere band 2 (open circles) is crossed by band 1 (closed\ncircles) which becomes more yrast (see Fig. 4). Until this\npoint, the large in-band BsE2d decay strength in band 2\ndominates the competition for electromagnetic decays. How-\never, the chance degeneracy of the 79\/2\u2212 state in band 2 with\nthat of band 1 provides an alternative decay path, at which\npoint, the population intensity passes over to band 1. The\nlarge in-band BsE2d strength of the transitions in band 1 then\ncarries the decay intensity until another chance degeneracy\noccurs with band 1 and the extension to the 1\/2\u2212 f521g band\n(squares) at spin 43\/2\" in Fig. 4. Notice how the open\nsquares of this band fall below those of band 1 (filled circles)\nbelow spin 43\/2. The new 43\/2\" state at 5195 keV is per-\nturbed in energy due to mixing with the 43\/2\" state in band\n1 at 5171 keV. The strength of this mixing was estimated to\nbe <10 keV from the sizable perturbation in Js2d value for\nband 1 at \"v<0.25 MeV in Fig. 7(b). This perturbation is\nalso evident in the alignment plot for band 1 at\n\"v<0.3 MeV in Fig. 5.\nThe aligned angular momentum ix (or alignment) for the\nnew band 1 (filled circles, K=0.5) and band 2 (open circles,\nK=0.5) in 175Hf is presented in Fig. 5. In the figure, the\nalignment of these new bands is compared with that of the\nnormal deformed 5\/2\u2212 f512g (diamonds) and 1\/2\u2212 f521g\n(squares) bands in 175Hf [28\u201331]. The other TSD bands in\nthe hafnium nuclei are not shown because the spins of these\nbands are not established.\nThe two bands based on the one-quasiparticle 5 \/2\u2212 f512g\nand 1\/2\u2212 f521g configurations in 175Hf are both affected by\nthe first i13\/2 band crossing at a rotational frequency of\n<0.35 MeV. This crossing introduces an alignment gain of\napproximately 7\" in these bands, above which they are as-\nsociated with three-quasiparticle configurations. In the 1\/2\u2212\nf521g bands, the +1\/2 signature (filled squares) shows a\nsharper crossing than the \u22121\/2 signature (open squares).\nThis high-spin extension of the +1\/2 band structure was only\nidentified from the decay of the new band 1 in this work and\nmay be associated with a different intrinsic configuration in\nthe region of the i13\/2 neutron band crossing. Above this i13\/2\ncrossing, the 5\/2\u2212 f512g bands continue and are crossed once\nmore by a five-quasiparticle configuration at a higher rota-\ntional frequency of <0.5 MeV. In comparison, the initial\nlow-spin apparent alignment of band 1 six<10\"d in 175Hf is\nlarger than that of the 1\/2\u2212f521g and 5\/2\u2212f512g one-\nquasiparticle bands in 175Hf six<0\"d. This initial alignment\nof band 1 in 175Hf is sufficiently large that it may result from\na five-quasiparticle configuration. Based on the available or-\nbits around the Fermi surface, for a larger deformation\nse2.0.3d than that of the normal-deformed bands, the\nmost likely low-spin configuration for band 1 in 175Hf is\nnsh9\/2dsi13\/2d2psi13\/2d2. At a higher rotational frequency\naround 0.5 MeV, band 1 shows the start of a sharp upbend\nsDix<10\"d where it is crossed by band 2. Such a large align-\nment gain is likely the result of a crossing involving a high-\nj orbit such as a j15\/2 neutron. In this case, band 2 would be\nbased on a higher-order seven-quasiparticle structure. The\nmost likely orbitals around the Fermi surface suggest that\nband 2 is based upon the nsh9\/2dsi13\/2d2sj15\/2d2psi13\/2d2 con-\nfiguration. Since band 2 in 175Hf is isospectral to the candi-\ndate triaxial superdeformed band 1 in 174Hf [25], then a simi-\nlar configuration (less the additional h9\/2 neutron) may well\nbe responsible for this band in 174Hf. This likely revises the\nspin assignments and interpretations made for the TSD bands\nin 174Hf [25,34].\nIn order to assess the possible triaxial nature of the new\nbands in 175Hf, a series of potential energy surface (PES)\ncalculations have been performed using the ULTIMATE\nCRANKER code [11\u201313,16]. Figure 6 shows the results of a\nPES calculation at I=99\/2 \", with parity and signature\nFIG. 4.

The calculation predicts several minima in\nthe potential energy surface, all of which have large defor-\nmations as a consequence of the intruder orbital occupation.\nUsing the labeling convention in Ref. [25], minimum IA in\nFig. 6 occurs at s\u00ab2 ,gd<s0.35,5\u00b0d and is the deepest at low\nspin. Minimum II lies <200 keV above minimum I at a\nlarger deformation and with considerable triaxiality, s\u00ab2 ,gd\n<s0.43,35\u00b0d. The third, more shallow minimum III occurs\nat s\u00ab2 ,gd<s0.50,\u221215\u00b0d with some triaxiality and a larger\ndeformation. In this example calculation, any possible tri-\naxial superdeformed band would be expected to be built\nupon minimum II in the potential energy surface in 175Hf. At\nhigh spin these calculations indicate that the lowest-energy\nstructure in this minimum has a configuration based upon the\npfsi13\/2d2 , sh9\/2d2g ,nfsj15\/2d , si13\/2d2g orbitals. It should be\nnoted though that in this high-spin region the alignment of a\npair of low-V, high-j quasiparticles may be overestimated\ndue to insufficient quenching of pairing in the calculations.\nUnfortunately, the ULTIMATE CRANKER calculations, which\nwere successfully employed in the lighter mass 160 region,\ndo not provide unique solutions for the configurations of the\nnew bands in 175Hf, since they do not predict the correct\nexperimental deformation.\nThe deformation and configurations of these bands have\nbeen interpreted by considering the behavior of the dynamic\nmoments of inertia [25]. Although the spin assignments for\nthe other candidate TSD bands in 168Hf [23], 170Hf [24], and\n174Hf [23] may need revising, the dynamic moments of iner-\ntia are not affected by these changes. Figure 7 demonstrates\nthat the dynamic moments of inertia Js2d for bands 1 and 2 in\n175Hf observed in this work are large and are similar to those\nof the so-called TSD bands in 168Hf [23], 170Hf [24], and\n174Hf [25].\nAll of the bands shown in Fig. 7(a) display a decreasing\nvalue of Js2d with increasing rotational frequency. This is in\ncontrast to the behavior of band 1 and that of the TSD bands\nin the Lu isotopes, 163Lu [3] and 164Lu [18] shown in Fig.\n7(b). These bands show an increase in Js2d with increasing\nfrequency. These observations show that there appear to be\ntwo classes of superdeformed bands in 175Hf based on their\ndeformation. The new band 1 in 175Hf is similar to the tri-\naxial superdeformed bands in the Lu nuclei, whereas band 2,\nand the other so-called TSD bands in 168Hf [23], 170Hf [24],\nand 174Hf [23], behave differently and are based on a larger\ndeformation.\nIn order to test these ideas, experimental deformations\nhave been extracted from the lifetimes of the states in bands\n1 and 2. This method was used to confirm the deformed\nnature of the bands in 174Hf and 168Hf with values of Qt\n<13.5 e b [34] and Qt=11.4\n\u22121.2\n+1.1 e b [23], respectively. Pre-\nliminary measurements for the quadrupole moments for the\nnew bands in 175Hf [34] suggest that band 1 has Qt<9 e b\nand band 2 has Qt<13 e b. These experimental deformation\nmeasurements are consistent with the suggestion that band 2\nis involved in a band crossing with band 1 where the addi-\ntional two intruder orbitals lead to the larger deformation of\nband 2. However, the values predicted from the ULTIMATE\nCRANKER calculations are much smaller than those experi-\nmentally extracted for band 2 [34]. This discrepancy, in ad-\ndition to the fact that multiple wobbling bands (one signature\nof triaxiality [8]) were not observed in this work, casts doubt\non the interpretation that these bands in the hafnium nuclei\nare built upon triaxial shapes.\nIn the absence of a detailed explanation for the high de-\nformation of band 2 in 175Hf, and by implication also in other\nhafnium isotopes, it is appropriate to draw attention to the\nprediction of \u201cgiant backbending\u201d in this region by Hilton\nand Mang [35], reproduced by Xu et al. [36]. The effect\narises from the high-spin favoring of highly aligned collec-\ntive oblate states. Figure 6 reveals that there may be some\nFIG. 6.

How-\never, at present, we have no clear evidence to support such\nan interpretation.\nV. SUMMARY\nEvidence is presented for two new highly deformed or\nsuperdeformed bands in 175Hf. These sequences are similar\nto those observed in the neighboring isotopes 168Hf, 170Hf,\nand 174Hf. However, because the newly established bands in\n175Hf have been linked into the known level scheme, definite\nspin assignments have been made for the first time in this\nregion. In this work, these highly deformed bands have been\ngrouped into two classes based on their deformation. The\nlower deformation band 1 is similar to the triaxial superde-\nformed bands observed in the Lu nuclei, while band 2 has a\nhigher deformation and is more like the candidate triaxial\nsuperdeformed bands observed in the neighboring hafnium\nisotopes. However, in the present work, no information was\ngained in 175Hf which could be used to reinforce the ideas\nthat the known candidate triaxial superdeformed bands in the\nHf region are indeed triaxial.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSpecial thanks to D.
