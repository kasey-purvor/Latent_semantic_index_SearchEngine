Introduction \nThe ability to shift spatial attention is fundamental for effective interactions with the world. \nThe importance of spatial attention is particularly evident in patients suffering from right \nbrain damage and symptoms of spatial neglect. A key characteristic in many of these patients \nis the automatic orienting of attention towards visual stimuli located on the ipsilesional side \n(D'Erme, Robertson et al., 1992; Gainotti, D'Erme et al., 1991) and the consecutive \ndifficulties in disengaging and reorienting attention from these stimuli (Posner, Walker et al., \n1984). Spatial neglect can therefore lead to bizarre behaviors such as bumping into objects \nplaced on the left, ignoring people situated on the left or eating only the right side of a dish. \nIntriguingly, the disorder of spatial neglect is not restricted to physical space, but also affects \nthe generation and\/or exploration of mental images (Bisiach and Luzzatti, 1978). Thus, when \nneglect patients describe familiar places, maps or other geographical facts from memory, they \nmay fail to name left-sided, but not right-sided landmarks of the imagined spatial layout (e.g., \nBartolomeo, D'Erme et al., 1994; Meador, Loring et al., 1987; Rode, Rossetti et al., 2004). \n \nIn a putatively independent line of research, cognitive psychologists are concerned with how \nnumbers are mentally represented and processed. Results of psychophysical experiments (e.g., \nDehaene, Bossini et al., 1993; Moyer and Landauer, 1967; Restle, 1970) suggest that \nnumerical magnitudes are represented on an analogue, oriented \u201cmental number line\u201d, with \nsmall numbers placed on the left, and larger numbers on the right side of space. Zorzi, Priftis \net al., (2002) tested this account of a mental number line in patients with left spatial neglect. \nThey reasoned that, if the numbers are spatially represented on a mental number line, then \nneglect patients who bisect physical lines to the right of the true center, should show a similar \nrightward bias for mental number lines. In support of this proposition, when asked to identify \nthe middle between two numbers (e.g. 1 & 9), neglect patients systematically placed the \n  4 \nbisection to the right of true centre (e.g. 6 or 7). These findings are an impressive \ndemonstration of the close interaction between spatial and numerical processing and are in \nline with research showing that space and numbers are intricately linked in the brain\u2019s \norganization - with the parietal lobes playing a crucial role in this association (see de Hevia, \nVallar et al., 2008; Hubbard, Piazza et al., 2005; Wood and Fischer, 2008; Sandrini and \nRusconi, In Press). Indeed, it has been suggested that the parietal circuits involved in shifting \nattention in the external world are homologous to those that shift the spotlight of attention \nalong mental representations such as the number line (e.g., Dehaene, Piazza et al., 2003; \nFischer, Castel et al., 2003; Hubbard, Piazza et al., 2005). \n \nThe current study further examined the relation between spatial disorder and number \nprocessing in neglect patients using an ensemble of novel tasks. To date, many studies that \nhave explored attention along the mental number line have used bisection tasks, which \npotentially are analogous to physical line bisection tasks (see Umilt\u00e0, Priftis et al., 2009). \nBesides a rightward bias in line bisection tasks, neglect patients also show a \u201cmagnetic \nattraction\u201d towards right-sided visual stimuli (De Renzi, Gentilini et al., 1989) and select \nitems from that side from a range of available response alternatives (Campbell and Oxbury, \n1976; Costa, Vaughan et al., 1969). For an array of horizontally arranged stimuli, neglect \npatients begin by naming objects on the right, whereas controls name objects on the left \n(Gainotti, D'Erme et al., 1991). Starting position is thought to be a particularly sensitive \nmeasure of visuo-spatial neglect (Azouvi, Samuel et al., 2002) and may detect residual \nimpairment after apparent recovery from neglect (Campbell and Oxbury, 1976; Mattingley, \nBradshaw et al., 1994). One specific aim of this study was to assess whether the distinctive \nfeatures of an initial rightward orientation and selection bias in visuo-motor space can also be \nfound in number space using a variety of tasks that allowed patients to select their response \n  5 \nfrom a range of correct response alternatives. The tasks were designed to involve every-day \nnumerical decision behavior without placing a high load on working memory (in contrast to \nthe abstract randomization procedure used by Loetscher and Brugger, 2009). They were \nexpected to provide further insight into systematic biases in numerical choice pertaining to the \npresence of hemispatial neglect. \n \nThe first task required participants to generate spontaneously a number between 1,000 and \n10,000 (Kubovy, 1977). This apparently simple task is potentially informative because a \nresponse is highly underspecified (i.e. there is a large range to sample from) and thus offers \nopportunities for schemata and representations to influence response selection (Scott, Barnard \net al., 2001). If numbers on the right side of the mental number line are more salient than \nthose on the left side, a rightward bias should be observed. Second, a \u2018Lotto\u2019 task was \nadministered, similar to an actual game highly popular in Switzerland. The Lotto task was \nadministered in two forms: one provided a physical record sheet, the other required use of a \nmental representation of the number range on this sheet. While a rightward bias was predicted \nfor both versions, dissociations were considered possible in some patients; such dissociations \nbetween physical and representational forms of neglect were previously described (Doricchi, \nGuariglia et al., 2005). Finally, a more traditional mental number line bisection task was \nadministered. The relationship between the biases across the different tasks was assessed \nusing a series of correlations. If asymmetries in the mental exploration of numbers are \nconsistent within individuals, a correlation should be observed between the tasks. Given that \nphysical and mental forms of neglect are dissociated in some individuals (Doricchi, Guariglia \net al., 2005), the correlation between the tasks that tap these functions may show little or no \ncorrelation. \n \n  6 \n2. Methods: \n2.1 Participants: \nTwenty patients (17 men) with left spatial neglect after a right hemisphere lesion and 17 \ncontrol patients (12 men) without spatial neglect after a right hemisphere lesion participated in \nthis study. The presence of spatial neglect was assessed by a series of paper and pencil tests, \nwhich included a line bisection task, a cancellation task, figure copying, reading and a figural \nfluency task (see Loetscher and Brugger, 2009, for task details and cut-off criteria). Inclusion \ncriteria for the neglect group were symptoms of left-sided neglect in at least two of these tests, \nwhereas the control group generally showed no neglect behavior in any task. The neglect \ngroup (mean age = 65 years, S.D. = 11) was older than the control group (mean age = 54 \nyears, S.D. = 11; t(35) = 3.0, p < .01). Importantly, however, the two groups did not differ in \nrespect to lesion etiology, days since incident, presence of visual field defects, years of \neducation and handedness (p > .2 in all cases). Testing was performed in accordance with the \nethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided \nwritten informed consent prior to participation. \n \n2.2 Numerical Tasks \nThree numerical tasks were administered to the patients. There was a time gap of at least 5 \nminutes between any two numerical tasks to avoid possible carry-over effects. During this \ntime the patients performed either paper and pencil neglect tasks or other neuropsychological \ntests. \n \n2.2.1 Number Generation Task: \nIn the number generation task participants spontaneously named the first number between \n1,000 and 10,000 that came to mind. The question was repeated using exactly the same \n  7 \nwording in case participants asked for clarification or if they produced a number outside the \ngiven range. The oral response was recorded by the experimenter.  \n \n2.2.2 Lottery Task: \nFor this experiment we adapted the Swiss Lotto game, which is very popular in Switzerland. \nIn the original game, participants pick six numbers from a set of 45 (i.e. from numbers \nranging from 1 to 45) by marking them on a lottery ticket. Six winning numbers are drawn by \na random number generator and the lucky participants, whose chosen numbers are drawn, \nreceive a monetary jackpot prize.  \n \nIn our adapted lottery game there were two conditions. In the imaginary condition, \nparticipants spontaneously named six numbers from a set of 45, which might be drawn the \nfollowing weekend. Importantly, before the participants were asked to generate the numbers, \nit was stressed that they should try to choose numbers randomly and not to pick significant \nnumbers like birthdays, anniversaries, street or house numbers as they might would do when \nplaying real lotto (see Heinze and Riedwyl, 1998). Furthermore, familiarity with the game \nwas assessed for each participant (e.g., whether the rules of the game are known by heart, how \nregularly they play). Oral responses were recorded by the experimenter. For each participant \nan imaginary lottery index was calculated as \n. The index scores \ncould range from -100 to +100. A negative imaginary lottery score indicates a bias towards \nthe selection of smaller numbers, whereas a positive score denotes a bias towards larger \nnumbers. Thus, a score of +100 indicates that all selected numbers were larger than the \nmiddle number (23). \n  8 \n \nIn the physical lottery condition, which took place roughly 40 minutes after the imaginary \ntask, a real lottery ticket was presented to the participants. On the original Swiss Lotto ticket, \nthe numbers are arranged on a 8 (rows) by 6 (columns) grid, starting with \u201c1\u201d on the top-left \ncorner and the following numbers ordered by their ordinal rank in reading direction, from left \nto right and from top to bottom. Since there are only 45 numbers, the bottom-right corner of \nthe grid is empty in the original ticket. We therefore changed the position of some numbers on \nthe bottom row so that they were arranged symmetrically around the midline of our \nexperimental ticket. This ticket was placed alongside the patient\u2019s midsagittal plane and they \nwere asked to choose six numbers, which might be drawn next weekend. Again, participants \nwere encouraged to pick numbers randomly and not to choose significant numbers as they \nmight do in a real lottery game. They were told that they did not need to remember any of the \npreviously orally generated numbers since this task would have no direct reference to the \nimaginary Lotto task. Like the imaginary lottery index, a physical lottery index was calculated \nfor each participant as \n. A negative physical \nlottery index indicates a bias to the leftward columns; a positive score denotes a rightward \nbias on the graphic lottery ticket. Thus, a score of +100 indicates that all marked numbers laid \non the right side (columns 4 to 6) of the lottery ticket. \n \n2.2.3 Number line bisection task \nA number line bisection task was administered to a subgroup of the participants (same task as \nin Loetscher, Bockisch et al., 2008, inclusion of this task was decided rather late in the study). \nNine of the neglect patients performed the number bisection task, in which eleven ascending \n  9 \n(e.g. 1\u20137) and eleven descending (e.g. 7-1) one-digit number pairs were read to the patients, \nand they then had to guess the mid-number of the given interval. The selection of one-digit \nstimuli was based on the findings in Zamarian, Egger et al., (2007). For each participant, the \nmean deviation of the true midpoint was calculated, with negative values indicating leftward \nbisections towards smaller numbers and positive values indicating rightward bisections \ntowards larger numbers. \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Number Generation Task \nOne participant was excluded from analysis, because he was unable to respond with a number \nin the correct range. The distribution of responses was remarkably similar for the neglect and \ncontrol group, showing a preference for numbers in the lowest, middle, and uppermost \nquintiles of the numerical intervals (see top panel Figure 1). The magnitude of the generated \nnumber did not differ significantly between the neglect (x\u00af = 5278, SD = 3205) and control \ngroup (x\u00af = 6328, SD = 3280, U = 131, p > .32). \n \n3.2 Lotto Task \nFamiliarity and knowledge of Lotto rules did not differ between the neglect and control group \n(p > .25 in both cases). Examination of the mean deviation for the imaginary Lotto task \nrevealed a similar leftward bias for both groups (neglect: x\u00af = -16.3, SD = 52.1; control: x\u00af = -\n22.7, SD = 29.4; U = 159.5, p > .75). Four out of the 20 neglect patients picked more large \nthan small numbers, whereas none of the 17 control patients did so (see mid panel Figure 1 \nfor the distribution of the indices). Bayesian inferential statistics (see, Crawford and \nGarthwaite, (2007) confirmed that the larger-number bias in these four patients was \nsignificantly different to the controls (Bayesian p < .042, one tailed). There was a positive \n  10 \ncorrelation between the magnitude of the generated number between 1,000 and 10,000 and the \nimaginary Lotto index in the neglect- (Spearman\u2019s rho = .49; p < .04), but not the control-\ngroup (Spearman\u2019s rho = -.06; p > .8). Thus, neglect patients who picked larger numbers in \nthe imaginary Lotto task, also generated higher 4-digit numbers.  \n \nIn the physical lottery task, neglect patients marked significantly more numbers placed on the \nright-hand side of the lottery ticked than did the control patients (neglect: x\u00af = 66.7, SD = 46.4; \ncontrol: x\u00af = 19.6, SD = 33.5; U = 96, p < .03, see bottom panel Figure 1 for distribution of \nindices). The magnitude of this right-side bias for the physical Lotto task was not related to \nthe bias for the imaginary Lotto task for the neglect- (Spearman\u2019s rho = .19; p > .42) or the \ncontrol-patients (Spearman\u2019s rho = .03; p > .91). \n \n3.3 Number line bisection task \nAs a group, the nine neglect patients did not show a rightward bias when bisecting numerical \nintervals (range from -.27 to .44, x\u00af = .08, SD = .22, z = 1.1, p > .26). There were, however, \nstrong correlations between the deviations in the number line bisections tasks and the \nmagnitude of the generated 4-digit number (Spearman\u2019s rho = .77; p < .02) and the imaginary \nLotto task (Spearman\u2019s rho = .69; p < .04). \n \n4. Discussion \nOne of the most distinctive features of spatial neglect in visuo-motor space is an initial \norienting bias towards the right side of a stimulus array and then a selection bias for stimuli \nfrom that side (Azouvi, Samuel et al., 2002). The present study examined whether this bias is \nalso evident in representational number space. In a left-to-right oriented representation of \nnumbers, selection biases would be reflected in an affinity for the spontaneous selection of \n  11 \nlarger numbers from a given numerical interval. Compared to 17 control patients, however, \nthe group of 20 patients with neglect neither picked larger numbers when choosing a number \nbetween 1,000 and 10,000 nor when playing an imaginary lottery game. In these tasks, \ntherefore, there was no indication of a general rightward bias in number space when \nspontaneously selecting from an array of small and large number response alternatives. \nConversely, when filling out a physical lottery ticket, the patients showed a bias towards \npicking numbers placed on the right-hand side of the ticket. \n \nFrom these results, one might conclude that one of the most sensitive clinical measures of \nvisual neglect \u2013 an initial rightward orienting bias \u2013 does not extend to the mental \nrepresentation of numbers. Thus, while the very first selection from an array of horizontally \narranged visual objects is typically from the right side (Azouvi, Samuel et al., 2002), this \ninitial attraction towards right-sided (i.e. larger) numbers is absent. The very first \nspontaneously selected number from an array of response alternatives is as often a small (left-\nsided) as it as a large (right-sided) number (see top panel Figure 1). This finding is in line \nwith research reported by Bartolomeo, D'Erme et al., (1994), who also failed to find an initial \nrightward orientation in representational space when patients described geographical maps \nfrom memory. Together these studies suggest that initial explorations with the mind\u2019s eye are \nnot magnetically attracted towards the ipsilesional side of mental representations. \n \nSpatial neglect is a heterogeneous disorder with a multitude of manifestations (see Adair and \nBarrett, 2008). Consequently, group comparisons may well fail to reveal the whole story in \nthe pattern of data. Indeed, for the neglect patients, there was a positive correlation between \nthe biases for the imaginary Lotto, number generation and number bisection tasks. Thus, \nindividuals who selected numbers to the left for the imaginary Lotto task, selected leftward \n  12 \nnumbers in the number generation task and also bisected numerical intervals to the left (and \nvice versa for individuals who selected to the right). These correlations demonstrate that \nasymmetries in the exploration along the mental number line are consistent within individuals \nacross the different tasks. Individuals with a rightward bias for all three tasks appear to show \nthe signs of representational neglect, with an inattention to the left side of number space \n(Zorzi, Priftis et al., 2002). In contrast, individuals with a leftward bias for all three tasks may \nbe performing like the controls, with a propensity for selecting smaller numbers. These \npatients thus showed a dissociation between physical and representational neglect, supporting \na previous conjecture that these two forms of neglect can be dissociated (Doricchi, Guariglia \net al., 2005). \n \nIn the imaginary lottery task, 4 out of the 20 neglect patients picked more large than small \nnumbers, whereas none of the 17 controls did so. Bayesian inferential statistics (Crawford and \nGarthwaite, 2007) confirmed that these patients can be considered to suffer from neglect in \nnumber space. The incidence of 20% (4 out of 20) of patients suffering from neglect in \nphysical and representational space lies in the spectrum reported by other investigators using \nnon-numerical tasks, which range from 6% (Bourlon, Pradat-Diehl et al., 2008) to around \n30% (Bartolomeo, Bachoud-Levi et al., 2005; Bartolomeo, D'Erme et al., 1994). While our \ndata on the incidence of neglect in number space is in line with those of previous studies on \nthe incidence of neglect for imagined space, it stands in contrast to the numerous articles \nreporting reliable rightward biases in mental number line bisection tasks (see Umilt\u00e0, Priftis et \nal., 2009). The many single-case and small-group studies, however, may not serve as a \nreliable basis for estimating the incidence of neglect in number space in stroke populations. \nOther studies do not report individual bisection data and do thus not allow inferences about \nincidence rates (e.g., Zorzi, Priftis et al., 2006). As of now, only two studies applied the \n  13 \nmental bisection task to more than 10 patients suffering from neglect. In these studies a \nreliable rightward deviation was found in 27% (3 out of 11 patients, Doricchi, Guariglia et al., \n2005) and 45% (10 out of 22 patients, see table S5 in Doricchi, Merola et al., in press). Thus, \nin these relatively large patient samples, neglect in number space was found in fewer than half \nof the patients. \n \nEven for visual-spatial neglect, the reported rate of occurrence after stroke varies from 12% to \n100% (see Bowen, McKenna et al., 1999). With particular reference to the present study, a \nnumber of factors may affect estimated incidence rates of neglect in number space. In \nparticular, tasks requiring more explicit orienting along the mental number line may more \noften document the presence of neglect. Furthermore, an increased salience of numbers used \nmore frequently in everyday language (see Dehaene and Mehler, 1992) might have affected \nthe choices in the number generation tasks. Despite this, the results of our multi-task \nexperiment suggest that neglect in number space may be less prevalent than currently \nassumed. In fact, along with the studies by Doricchi and collaborators (Doricchi, Guariglia et \nal., 2005; Doricchi, Merola et al., in press) the present study questions the idea that a \nrightward bias in number space is found in a majority of patients suffering form visual-spatial \nneglect. Future prospective studies assessing larger, consecutive samples of patients are \nneeded to shed more light on this issue.  \n \nTo conclude, the results of the current study confirm previous research showing that, while \nvisual exploration of and motor interactions with the real world are severely impaired in \nneglect, spatial exploration with the mind\u2019s eye may not be affected to a comparable extent \n(e.g., Bartolomeo, Bachoud-Levi et al., 2005; Bartolomeo, D'Erme et al., 1994; Bourlon, \nPradat-Diehl et al., 2008; Halsband, Gruhn et al., 1985). This imbalance in the frequencies of \n  14 \nvisuo-motor and representational neglect supports the notion that neglect is predominantly a \ndisorder of exogenous, stimulus-driven allocation of attention with relatively preserved \nendogenous, strategy-driven orienting capacities (Bartolomeo and Chokron, 2002; Natale, \nPosteraro et al., 2005; Sieroff, Decaix et al., 2007; Bourlon, Pradat-Diehl et al., 2008). \n  15 \nReferences: \nADAIR JC AND BARRETT AM.
