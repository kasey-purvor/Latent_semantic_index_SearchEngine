While aggregation is the merging of\ncon\u0087icting individual opinions into a social outcome, deliberation involves\nthe discussion of these opinions and their possible transformation by the\nindividuals deliberating. Jon Elster summarizes the di\u00a4erence between the\ntwo approaches as follows:\n\u0091The core of the [deliberative approach] ... is that rather than\naggregating or \u0085ltering preferences, the political system should\nbe set up with a view to changing them by public debate and\nconfrontation ... [T]here would [then] not be any need for an\naggregation mechanism, since a rational discussion would tend\nto produce unanimous preferences.\u00921\nThe contrast between the two approaches is probably overstated. More\nplausibly, they are complementary, not contradictory. In many real-world\ncollective decisions, aggregation is preceded by some form of group commu-\nnication \u0096in the best case, by the kind of reasoned deliberation envisaged by\ndeliberative democrats.2 Nonetheless, social choice theory, our best formal\ntheory of collective decision-making, has focused mostly on aggregation and\nsaid little about pre-decision communication. Game theorists have recently\ngiven more attention to communication, investigating for example the incen-\ntives for and against truth-telling in deliberative settings,3 but we still lack a\nsocial-choice-theoretic model of the transformation of opinion under various\nforms of group communication. The aim of this paper is to contribute to\n\u0085lling this gap in the literature.\n1See Elster (1986, p. 112). On deliberative democracy, see, e.g., Cohen (1989), Dryzek\n(1990, 2000), Fishkin (1991), Gutman and Thompson (1996), Bohman and Rehg (1997).\n2E.g., Miller (1992), Knight and Johnson (1994), Dryzek and List (2003).\n3E.g., Austen-Smith and Feddersen (2006), Calvert (2006), Landa and Meirowitz\n(2006), Hafer and Landa (forthcoming).\n2\nI model opinions as judgments \u0096 acceptance or rejection \u0096 on certain\npropositions, drawing on the theory of judgment aggregation.4 The proposi-\ntions may be logically interconnected, so that the judgments on some propo-\nsitions constrain those that can rationally be held on others. This way of\nmodelling opinions is very general: As illustrated below, it can represent\nnot only beliefs but also preferences. While the theory of judgment ag-\ngregation focuses on judgment aggregation functions, I here analyze what I\ncall judgment transformation functions. A judgment transformation func-\ntion maps each admissible pro\u0085le of individual sets of judgments on the\ngiven propositions not to a collective set of judgments on them \u0096 as an\naggregation function does \u0096but to another, possibly revised pro\u0085le of in-\ndividual sets of judgments. The input pro\u0085le represents the individuals\u0092\npre-communication judgments, the output pro\u0085le their post-communication\njudgments. The process may or may not lead to consensus. The concept\nof a judgment transformation function is very \u0087exible, with di\u00a4erent such\nfunctions representing very di\u00a4erent communication processes. Some may\nsatisfy conditions of good democratic deliberation, while others may capture\nindoctrination or the blind mimicking of some charismatic leader.\nUsing the new model, I prove a baseline impossibility theorem. When\nthe propositions under consideration are logically connected with each other,\nany judgment transformation function satisfying some initially plausible con-\nditions must be maximally conservative: It must be the identity function,\nunder which nobody ever changes his or her judgment on anything. The\n4 Inspired by the \u0091doctrinal\u0092 and \u0091discursive\u0092 paradoxes (Kornhauser and Sager 1986,\nPettit 2001), judgment aggregation was formalized by List and Pettit (2002, 2004), com-\nbining Arrow\u0092s (1951\/1963) axiomatic approach to social choice theory with a logical\nrepresentation of propositions. Further results and model extensions were provided by\nList (2003, 2004), Pauly and van Hees (2006), Dietrich (2006, 2007), Nehring and Puppe\n(2008), van Hees (2007), Dietrich and List (2007a,b,c, 2008), Dokow and Holzman (forth-\ncoming, 2006) and Pigozzi (2006). Judgment aggregation theory is closely related to ab-\nstract aggregation theory, e.g., Wilson (1975), Rubinstein and Fishburn (1986), Nehring\nand Puppe (2002), and to the theory of belief merging (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 2002).\n3\ntheorem\u0092s conditions thus imply the strongest version of what Gerry Mackie\nhas called the \u0091unchanging minds hypothesis\u0092:\n\u0091[P]ublic deliberation on a pending item seldom seems to change\nanyone\u0092s mind.\u00925\nThe conditions, informally stated, are the following:\n(1) Any pro\u0085le of rational individual judgment sets is admissible as input\nto the communication.\n(2) The output of the communication is also a pro\u0085le of rational individual\njudgment sets.\n(3) If there is unanimity on every proposition before communication (not\njust on a single proposition), this is preserved after communication.\n(4) The individuals do not always ignore their pre-communication judg-\nments in forming their post-communication judgments.\n(5) The communication focuses on one proposition at a time, which in\nturn can be shown to be necessary for protecting the communicative\nprocess against strategic manipulability.6\nSince only a degenerate communicative process without any opinion change\nsatis\u0085es these \u0085ve conditions together, which would rule out e\u00a4ective group\ndeliberation as envisaged by deliberative democrats, I consider relaxing some\nof them. The signi\u0085cance of the new theorem, I suggest, lies not in estab-\nlishing the impossibility of deliberative democracy, but rather in showing\nwhich conditions can and cannot be met if group communication is to be\ne\u00a4ective. If any one of the \u0085ve conditions is dropped, the theorem\u0092s nega-\ntive conclusion no longer follows. So the result provides a map of the logical\n5See Mackie (2006, p. 279).\n6Below I distinguish a weaker and a stronger version of this condition.\n4\nspace of possible communication processes and thereby shows us what, from\na \u0091bird\u0092s eye\u0092perspective, the functional relations between the inputs and\noutputs of e\u00a4ective deliberative processes can and cannot look like.\nWhat, then, are the most plausible escape routes from the impossibility?\nI argue that, except in special cases, the \u0085rst four conditions are hard to\ngive up, but the \u0085fth \u0096 the focus on a single proposition at a time \u0096 is a\nplausible candidate for relaxation. Thus e\u00a4ective group communication as\nenvisaged by deliberative democrats requires some kind of \u0091holism\u0092: The\nobjects of judgment transformation cannot generally be single propositions\nin isolation, but must be larger \u0091webs\u0092of interconnected propositions. This\nechoes the Duhem-Quine thesis on holism in science, according to which\none cannot empirically test a single proposition in isolation, but only in\nconjunction with a larger web of related propositions.7\nThe present conclusion re\u0085nes Mackie\u0092s suggestion that the network\nstructure of opinions a\u00a4ects whether or not deliberation can change minds:\n\u0091[D]ue to the network, the e\u00a4ects of deliberative persuasion are typically la-\ntent, indirect, delayed, or disguised.\u00928 My result shows that the unchanging\nminds hypothesis is true when communication is restricted to one proposi-\ntion at a time,9 but false when communication is su\u00a2 ciently holistic. The\nprice of this holism is strategic manipulability of the communication process,\nby providing incentives for strategic misrepresentation of individual judg-\nments.\nIt may be tempting to think that the holistic property of judgment trans-\nformation is just a trivial consequence of the presence of logical connections\nbetween propositions. To see that this is not the case, notice that rational\nopinion change without holism is entirely possible if one of the other four\nconditions of the theorem is suitably relaxed. Even a process as non-holistic\n7See Quine (1951).\n8Mackie (2006, p. 279) says: \u0091The network structure of attitudes explains why the\nunchanging minds hypothesis seems to be true, and why it is false.\u0092\n9 In the presence of logical connections between propositions.\n5\nas deference to the majority on each proposition, for instance, can lead to\nperfectly rational post-communication judgments if the theorem\u0092s \u0085rst con-\ndition \u0096specifying the domain of admissible inputs to the communication\n\u0096is appropriately adjusted, as shown below. The theorem\u0092s conclusion is a\ngenuinely joint implication of its \u0085ve conditions.\nAfter a discussion of the impossibility result, I give some examples of\nfeasible judgment transformation functions that do allow opinion change,\ndistinguishing between those that generate consensus and those that gen-\nerate something less than consensus. Among the latter are transformation\nfunctions that o\u00a4er a new theoretical explanation of the much discussed\nphenomenon of deliberation-induced \u0091meta-agreement\u0092.10 This phenomenon\nis relevant to democratic decision-making because it helps to avoid some of\nthe notorious paradoxes of aggregation. Thus the paper contributes new\npositive results in addition to its new theoretical model and impossibility\ntheorem. I conclude with a brief discussion of how the present work is related\nto game-theoretic works on communication.11\n10The concept of \u0091meta-agreement\u0092was introduced in List (2002). See also note 2 and\nempirical evidence in List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean (2000\/2006).\n11 Important related works include Lehrer and Wagner\u0092s (1981) model of rational consen-\nsus, which can be seen as a probabilistic analogue of the judgment transformation model\n(where opinions are represented not by binary judgments, but by subjective probability\nassignments), and the theory of conciliation and consensus in belief merging (Konieczny\n2004; Gauwin, Konieczny and Marquis 2005), whose key concept \u0096a conciliation operator\n\u0096is related to the present concept of a judgment transformation function. The theory of\nindividual belief revision \u0096either in a Bayesian tradition or in the Alchourr\u00f3n-G\u00e4rdenfors-\nMakinson framework (1985) \u0096addresses a somewhat di\u00a4erent question from the present\none. It focuses on individual belief change in response to new information rather than\nthe transformation of opinions in group communication. (The latter may be only partly\ninformation-driven and sometimes not information-driven at all.)\n6\n2 Opinions as judgments on propositions\nHow can the opinions held by a group of individuals at a given time be\nmodelled? In this section, I explain how to model them as judgments on\npropositions expressed in logic.12 I turn to their aggregation and transfor-\nmation subsequently.\nThe ingredients of the model are the following. There is a group of indi-\nviduals.13 The set of propositions considered by them is called the agenda.\nPropositions are represented by sentences, generally denoted \u0091p\u0092, \u0091q\u0092; \u0091r\u0092, ...,\nfrom propositional logic or a more general language.14 Propositional logic\ncan express atomic propositions, without logical connectives, such as \u0091a\u0092,\n\u0091b\u0092, \u0091c\u0092, ..., and compound propositions, with the logical connectives \u0091not\u0092,\n\u0091and\u0092, \u0091or\u0092, \u0091if-then\u0092and \u0091if and only if\u0092, such as \u0091a and b\u0092and \u0091if a or b, then\nnot c\u0092. As is standard in logic, one can distinguish between consistent and\ninconsistent sets of propositions.15\nEach individual\u0092s opinions at a given time are represented by a judgment\nset : the set of all those propositions in the agenda that the individual ac-\ncepts.16 On the standard interpretation, to accept proposition \u0091p\u0092means to\nbelieve \u0091p\u0092; thus judgments are binary cognitive attitudes. Alternatively, to\naccept \u0091p\u0092could mean to desire \u0091p\u0092; judgments would then be binary emo-\ntive attitudes. A judgment set is called consistent if it is a consistent set\n12This follows List and Pettit (2002, 2004) and the generalization in Dietrich (2007).\n13The group is \u0085nite, and individuals are labelled 1; 2; :::; n.\n14Formally, the agenda is a subset X of the logic, where (i) X is closed under negation\n(if \u0091p\u0092is in X, then so is \u0091not p\u0092), (ii) \u0091not not p\u0092is identi\u0085ed with \u0091p\u0092, and (iii) X contains\nno tautological or contradictory propositions. Instead of propositional logic, any logic\nwith some minimal properties can be used, including expressively richer logics such as\npredicate, modal, deontic and conditional logics (Dietrich 2007).\n15 In propositional logic, a set of propositions is consistent if all its members can be\nsimultaneously true, and inconsistent otherwise. E.g., f\u0091a\u0092, \u0091a or b\u0092g is a consistent set,\nwhereas f\u0091a\u0092, \u0091not a\u0092g and f\u0091a\u0092, \u0091if a then b\u0092, \u0091not b\u0092g are not. More generally, consistency\nis de\u0085nable in terms of a more basic notion of logical entailment (Dietrich 2007).\n16Formally, individual i\u0092s judgment set is a subset Ji of the agenda X.\n7\nof propositions and complete if it contains a member of each proposition-\nnegation pair in the agenda. A combination of judgment sets across all the\nindividuals in the group is called a pro\u0085le.17\nLet me give some examples of agendas of propositions on which groups\nof individuals may make judgments and to which the theorems presented\nbelow apply:\nExample 1: Climate change. A panel of experts deliberates about\nclimate change. The agenda on which the experts make judgments contains\nthe following propositions and their negations: \u0091Global CO2 emissions are\nabove 30000 million metric tons of carbon per annum\u0092(\u0091a\u0092); \u0091If global CO2\nemissions are above this threshold, then the global temperature will increase\nby at least 1.5oC by 2030\u0092 (\u0091if a then b\u0092); \u0091The global temperature will\nincrease by at least 1.5oC by 2030\u0092(\u0091b\u0092).18\nExample 2: A tenure case. A university committee deliberates about\nwhether to grant tenure to a junior academic. The agenda on which the\ncommittee members make judgments contains the following propositions\nand their negations: \u0091The candidate is excellent at teaching\u0092 (\u0091a\u0092); \u0091The\ncandidate is excellent at research\u0092 (\u0091b\u0092); \u0091Excellence at both teaching and\nresearch is necessary and su\u00a2 cient for tenure\u0092(\u0091c if and only if (a and b)\u0092);\n\u0091The candidate should be given tenure\u0092(\u0091c\u0092).19\nExample 3: Ranking candidates or policy options. A political\ndecision-making body (e.g., a legislature, committee or electorate) deliber-\nates about how to rank three or more candidates or policy options in an\norder of social preference. The agenda on which the individuals make judg-\nments contains all propositions of the form \u0091x is preferable to y\u0092and their\nnegations, where x and y are distinct candidates or options from some set of\n17Formally, a pro\u0085le is an n-tuple (J1; J2; :::; Jn).\n18Variants of this example appear across the literature on judgment aggregation.\n19This example is due to Bovens and Rabinowicz (2006).\n8\navailable ones and \u0091is preferable to\u0092is a binary relation, with the rationality\nconstraints on preferences built into the (predicate) logic.20\nExample 4: Group membership. A club, society or association de-\nliberates about which candidates from a list of three or more available ones\nshould be granted membership, subject to the constraint that some, but not\nall, candidates should be granted membership. The agenda on which the in-\ndividuals make judgments contains all propositions of the form \u0091candidate j\nshould be granted membership\u0092and their negations, where j is any available\ncandidate and the mentioned constraint is built into the logic.21\nEach of these agendas exhibits certain logical connections between propo-\nsitions. By contrast, \u0091trivial\u0092agendas such as those containing only a single\nproposition-negation pair are not typical in complex decision-making set-\ntings. To set them aside, I assume throughout the paper that the agenda is\nat least minimally complex in a sense satis\u0085ed in all the examples but whose\ntechnical details are not central for the exposition.22\n20For details, see Dietrich and List (2007a), drawing on List and Pettit (2004).\n21The conjunction of the propositions in quotes is stipulated to be false and their dis-\njunction to be true. The example is due to Kasher and Rubinstein (1997).\n22Formally, I assume that (i) the agenda has an inconsistent subset of three or more\npropositions that becomes consistent upon removing any one of its members, and (ii) it is\nnot (nor isomorphic to) a set of propositions whose only logical connectives are \u0091not\u0092and \u0091if\nand only if\u0092. Property (ii) is a variant of non-a\u00a2 neness (Dokow and Holzman forthcoming)\nand even-number negatability (Dietrich and List 2007a). Properties (i) and (ii) are met in\nexamples 1 to 4. E.g., the agenda containing \u0091a\u0092, \u0091if a then b\u0092, \u0091b\u0092and negations (example 1)\nsatis\u0085es (i) because its three-member inconsistent subset f\u0091a\u0092;\u0091if a then b\u0092;\u0091not b\u0092g becomes\nconsistent if any one proposition is removed; it obviously satis\u0085es (ii). In examples 2\nto 4, a further property is met, which I assume only where explicitly stated: (iii) any\nproposition in the agenda can be deduced from any other proposition in it via a sequence\nof pairwise conditional entailments. Property (iii) has been introduced under the name\ntotal blockedness by Nehring and Puppe (2002).\n9\nFigure 1: Judgment aggregation\n3 The aggregation of judgments\nBefore I can formally analyze the problem of judgment transformation, it\nis necessary to recapitulate the problem of judgment aggregation: How can\neach pro\u0085le of individual judgment sets on a given agenda be aggregated into\na collective judgment set? This problem arises, for example, in referenda\ninvolving multiple propositions, in legislatures or committees deciding what\nfactual and normative propositions to accept in legislation, in multi-member\ncourts resolving cases on the basis of several premises, and in expert panels\nseeking to merge several scienti\u0085c viewpoints into a collective viewpoint.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, an aggregation function is a function that\nmaps each pro\u0085le of individual judgment sets in some domain to a collec-\ntive judgment set.23 Examples of aggregation functions are majority voting,\nwhere each proposition is collectively accepted if and only if it is accepted\nby a majority of individuals; supermajority or unanimity rules, where each\nproposition is collectively accepted if and only if it is accepted by a certain\nquali\u0085ed majority of individuals, for example, two thirds, three quarters,\n23While a judgment aggregation function, as de\u0085ned in List and Pettit (2002), goes back\nto Arrovian social choice theory, a related concept is that of a merging operator in belief\nmerging (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 2002). Parallels are discussed in Pigozzi (2006).\n10\nor all of them; and dictatorships, where the collective judgment set is al-\nways the individual judgment set of the same antecedently \u0085xed individual,\nthe \u0091Arrovian\u0092dictator, named after Kenneth Arrow\u0092s classic impossibility\ntheorem.24 Many other aggregation functions have been proposed.\nAlthough the possibilities seem abundant, it is surprisingly di\u00a2 cult to\n\u0085nd an aggregation function that guarantees consistent collective judgment\nsets. Notoriously, majority voting can produce inconsistent collective judg-\nment sets even when all individual judgment sets are consistent.25 Consider\nthe climate change example above (example 1), and suppose there are three\nexperts on the panel, with opinions as shown in Table 1. The \u0085rst expert\njudges that \u0091a\u0092, \u0091if a then b\u0092and \u0091b\u0092; the second judges that \u0091a\u0092, but \u0091not (if\na then b)\u0092and \u0091not b\u0092; and the third judges that \u0091if a then b\u0092, but \u0091not a\u0092\nand \u0091not b\u0092. Clearly, each expert holds an individually consistent judgment\nset. Yet, the majority judgments are inconsistent: Majorities accept \u0091a\u0092, \u0091if\na then b\u0092 and \u0091not b\u0092, an inconsistent set of propositions in the standard\nsense of logic. The same problem can arise in each of the other examples\ngiven above.\n\u0091a\u0092 \u0091if a then b\u0092 \u0091b\u0092\nIndividual 1 True True True\nIndividual 2 True False False\nIndividual 3 False True False\nMajority True True False\nTable 1: A pro\u0085le of individual judgment sets\nCan we \u0085nd aggregation funtions that are immune to this problem? The\nrecent literature on judgment aggregation has explored this question in great\n24See Arrow (1951\/1963). Note that Arrow\u0092s theorem itself concerns preference aggre-\ngation, not judgment aggregation. The relationship between preference and judgment\naggregation is discussed in List and Pettit (2004) and Dietrich and List (2007a).\n25This is the discursive paradox (Pettit 2001, extending Kornhauser and Sager 1986),\nwhich generalizes Condorcet\u0092s paradox of majority voting (List and Pettit 2004).\n11\ngenerality. One of its generic \u0085ndings is that there exist no democratically\nappealing aggregation functions satisfying the following conditions:\nUniversal domain. The aggregation function accepts as admissible input\nany possible pro\u0085le of consistent and complete individual judgment sets.\nCollective rationality. The aggregation function produces as output a\nconsistent and complete collective judgment set.\nConsensus preservation. If all individuals hold the same judgment set,\nthis is also the collective judgment set.\nIndependence\/systematicity. The collective judgment on any proposi-\ntion \u0091p\u0092 on the agenda depends only on individual judgments on \u0091p\u0092 [and\nthe pattern of dependence is the same across propositions]. (Independence\nomits, and systematicity includes, the neutrality clause in square brackets.)\nTheorem 1 Any aggregation function satisfying universal domain, collec-\ntive rationality, consensus preservation and independence\/systematicity is a\ndictatorship of one individual.26 (Whether the result requires independence\nor systematicity depends on how the minimal complexity of the agenda is\nde\u0085ned.27)\nA lot could be said about how to interpret this theorem, which gener-\nalizes Arrow\u0092s original impossibility theorem.28 To avoid the dictatorship\n26This theorem was proved by Dietrich and List (2007a) and Dokow and Holzman\n(forthcoming), building on earlier results by List and Pettit (2002), Nehring and Puppe\n(2002), Pauly and van Hees (2006), Dietrich (2006).\n27 If the agenda meets only properties (i) and (ii), systematicity is needed for the result;\nif it also meets property (iii), independence is enough.\n28This is because Theorem 1 also applies to the special case of preference aggregation,\nrepresentable in the judgment aggregation model, as in the case of ranking candidates or\noptions in example 3 above. Explicit derivations of Arrow\u0092s theorem (1951\/1963) as a\ncorollary of Theorem 1 are given in Dietrich and List (2007a) and Dokow and Holzman\n(forthcoming). For earlier derivations of Arrow-like results from judgment and abstract\naggregation results, see Wilson (1975), List and Pettit (2004) and Nehring (2003).\n12\nconclusion, we must relax one of universal domain, collective rationality,\nconsensus preservation or independence\/systematicity. Given the present\nfocus on group communication, however, I set these issues aside for the mo-\nment and return to analogous issues when I present the new theorem on the\ntransformation of judgments.\n4 The transformation of judgments\nTo model the transformation of judgments, I introduce the new concept of a\njudgment transformation function. As illustrated in Figure 2, this is de\u0085ned\nas a function that maps each pro\u0085le of individual judgment sets in some\ndomain to a pro\u0085le of individual judgment sets in some co-domain, possibly\nthe same as the domain.29 The input pro\u0085le represents the individuals\u0092\njudgments before communication, the output pro\u0085le their judgments after\ncommunication. The output judgments may or may not di\u00a4er from the\ninput judgments, and the transformation may or may not lead to consensus.\nA simple example of a transformation function is deference to the ma-\njority, where, after communication, each individual accepts all those propo-\nsitions that a majority accepts before communication. But just as majority\nvoting as an aggregation function fails to guarantee consistent collective\njudgments, so deference to the majority as a transformation function fails\nto guarantee consistent output judgments.30 If each expert in the climate\nchange example were to defer to the majority judgments in Table 1, for in-\nstance, the resulting post-communication judgments would be inconsistent.\nAn alternative to deference to the majority is deference to a supermajor-\nity or unanimity : Here each individual accepts all those propositions after\n29Just as a judgment aggregation function is related to a belief merging operator, so\na judgment transformation function is related to a belief conciliation operator (Gauwin,\nKonieczny and Marquis 2006). Pigozzi\u0092s (2006) insights on the parellels between judgment\naggregation and belief merging apply, mutatis mutandis, to revision too.\n30For a critique of deference to a majority, see Pettit (2006).\n13\nFigure 2: Judgment transformation\ncommunication that a certain quali\u0085ed majority \u0096perhaps everyone \u0096ac-\ncepts before communication. If the supermajority threshold is su\u00a2 ciently\nlarge, such a transformation function performs better than deference to a\nmajority at securing consistency. If the propositions are as in the climate\nchange example, for instance, any threshold greater than two thirds guaran-\ntees consistent output judgments.31 But such a transformation function has\nproblems of its own. First, the individuals\u0092post-communication judgments\nwill be incomplete on all those issues on which there is no supermajority\nconsensus; and second, they may violate deductive closure: An individual\nmay come to accept \u0091a\u0092and \u0091if a then b\u0092, because each receives the required\nsupermajority support, and yet fail to accept \u0091b\u0092, because there is no super-\nmajority consensus on \u0091b\u0092. Moreover, it is hard to solve these two problems\ntogether. Only a unanimity threshold can generally prevent violations of de-\nductive closure,32 but it also ampli\u0085es the incompleteness problem, because\nit permits the acceptance of only those propositions on which there is total\nagreement.\n31To make this distinct from unanimity deference, the group size must be greater than\nthree. For a discussion of deference to a supermajority, see List (2006b).\n32For a proof, see Dietrich and List (2007b).\n14\nOther examples of transformation functions are opinion leader functions,\nwhere each individual adopts as his or her output judgment set the input\njudgment set of an antecedently \u0085xed individual, called the individual\u0092s opin-\nion leader. The opinion leader may di\u00a4er for di\u00a4erent individuals or be the\nsame across individuals. In the latter case, the opinion leader function is the\ncommunicative analogue of a dictatorial aggregation function. An opinion\nleader function may represent not only the presence of one or several par-\nticularly persuasive individuals but also the e\u00a4ects of indoctrination, pro-\npaganda or, if di\u00a4erent individuals cluster around di\u00a4erent opinion leaders,\ngroup fragmentation. Finally, an entirely degenerate transformation func-\ntion is the identity function, where the output pro\u0085le is always the same as\nthe input pro\u0085le: Nobody ever changes his or her judgments.\nNone of these examples of judgment tranformation functions appear to\nbe particularly \u0091deliberative\u0092. This is not accidental. Just as many (in fact,\nmost) possible aggregation functions do not qualify as \u0091democratic\u0092\u0096think\nof Arrovian dictatorships as the most extreme examples \u0096so many (again,\nmost) transformation functions are far from \u0091deliberative\u0092 in the sense of\nthe normative literature on deliberative democracy. The main purpose of\nde\u0085ning judgment transformation functions in such general terms is to have\na \u0087exible concept available which allows us to represent a large spectrum\nof possible communication processes, ranging from degenerate ones without\nany opinion change and ones involving indoctrination to deliberation. Below\nI introduce some other, arguably more compelling judgment transformation\nfunctions. In particular, I discuss the class of so-called constrained min-\nimal revision functions, which may be of some relevance for theoretically\nexplaining the empirically observed phenomenon of deliberation-induced\n\u0091meta-agreement\u0092. Generally, a transformation function may depend on the\nindividuals, their context and the agenda of propositions under considera-\ntion.\nJust as the theory of judgment aggregation seeks to characterize the log-\n15\nical space of possible aggregation functions satisfying various conditions, so\nI now want to explore the logical space of possible transformation functions\nsatisfying certain conditions. This exercise is illuminating from two perspec-\ntives. From a normative perspective, deliberative democrats have proposed\na number of desiderata that a group communication process should meet\nin order to count as properly \u0091deliberative\u0092. Habermas\u0092s conditions on an\n\u0091ideal speech situation\u0092 are well-known desiderata of this kind. I do not\nanalyze Habermas\u0092s own conditions here, but by formalizing such desider-\nata as conditions on a transformation function \u0096e.g., as conditions on its\ninputs, outputs or the relationship between inputs and outputs \u0096we may\nask whether they can be met together and what a transformation function\nlooks like that meets them all. From a positive perspective, several e\u00a4ects of\ngroup communication on individual opinions are empirically known, rang-\ning from \u0091meta-agreement\u0092to \u0091group polarization\u0092.33 By formally describing\nsuch e\u00a4ects as properties of the underlying transformation function, we may\ninvestigate what transformation functions explain those empirically observed\ne\u00a4ects. While my model is consistent with either of these interpretations \u0096\nnormative or positive \u0096the results provable in it must obviously be viewed\ndi\u00a4erently depending on whether the conditions on a transformation func-\ntion are interpreted normatively or positively.\n5 An impossibility result\nLet me introduce \u0085ve conditions on a transformation function.34 Although\neach condition can be made plausible, I do not suggest that they are all\nequally compelling; indeed, I relax some of them below. However, they are\n33For evidence of these two kinds of e\u00a4ects, see List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean\n(2000\/2006) and Sunstein (2002), respectively.\n34As will be apparent, four of these conditions have analogues in the context of aggre-\ngation; one condition, miminal relevance, has no established counterpart in the literature\non aggregation.\n16\nuseful for analyzing the logical space of possible transformation functions.\nUniversal domain. The transformation function accepts as admissible\ninput any possible pro\u0085le of consistent and complete individual judgment\nsets.\nUniversal domain requires the transformation function to cope with con-\nditions of pluralism on the input side, subject to the constraint of full indi-\nvidual rationality. A more demanding input condition would require it to\ncope also with less than fully rational individual judgments; but the theorem\nbelow shows that even the present requirement is far from undemanding.35\nRational co-domain. The transformation function produces as output a\npro\u0085le of consistent and complete individual judgment sets.\nRational co-domain requires the transformation function to generate out-\nputs that also meet the constraint of full individual rationality. Later I\nconsider a weaker variant of this requirement.\nConsensus preservation. The transformation function maps any unani-\nmous pro\u0085le to itself.\nConsensus preservation requires that, if all individuals agree on all propo-\nsitions on the agenda before communication, this all-way consensus be pre-\nserved after communication. This is distinct from either of the following,\narguably less plausible conditions. The \u0085rst is consensus generation, the\nrequirement that the transformation function map every pro\u0085le to a unan-\nimous pro\u0085le, as captured by Elster\u0092s quote above. Although endorsed by\nmany deliberative democrats, especially those of a Habermasian orientation,\n35The present model certainly allows us to study, for example, transformation functions\nthat map pro\u0085les of less than fully rational individual judgment sets into pro\u0085les of fully\nrational ones. Indeed, a frequently mentioned goal of deliberation is to correct rationality\nviolations in individual judgments.\n17\nthis requirement seems unduly demanding and empirically unrealistic. The\nsecond condition from which consensus preservation is distinct is proposition-\nwise unanimity preservation, the requirement that if all individuals agree on\na particular proposition \u0091p\u0092before deliberation, without necessarily agreeing\non anything else, this unanimity on \u0091p\u0092be preserved after deliberation. This\nrequires that even an incompletely theorized agreement on \u0091p\u0092be preserved\nin communication, even if di\u00a4erent individuals agree on \u0091p\u0092for incompatible\nreasons. Such a requirement is neither normatively compelling nor empir-\nically realistic.36 For example, upon noticing that you and I support \u0091p\u0092\nfor incompatible reasons, we may each decide to give up our belief in \u0091p\u0092.\nBy contrast, consensus preservation is the much milder requirement that an\nall-way consensus on everything \u0096in those rare cases in which it occurs \u0096be\nstable under communication.\nTo state the next condition, call two pro\u0085les variants for a given indi-\nvidual if they coincide for all individuals except the given one.\nMinimal relevance. For each individual, there exists at least one admissi-\nble pair of variant input pro\u0085les for which the individual\u0092s output judgment\nsets di\u00a4er.\nMinimal relevance requires that individuals do not always ignore their\npre-communication judgments. This is a very mild requirement: It only\nrules out that an individual\u0092s pre-communication judgments never make\nany di\u00a4erence to his or her post-communication judgments. It does not\nrequire those pre-communication judgments to make a di\u00a4erence more than\nonce, nor does it say anything about how they should make a di\u00a4erence.\nConsistently with minimal relevance, the individual\u0092s post-communication\njudgments could even respond negatively to his or her pre-communication\njudgments.\n36On incompletely theorized agreements, see Sunstein (1994) and, in the context of judg-\nment aggregation, List (2006a). For critiques of propositionwise unanimity preservation,\nsee Bradley (2007), Mongin (2005) and Nehring (2005).\n18\nIndependence\/systematicity. Each individual\u0092s output judgment on any\nproposition on the agenda depends only on the input judgments on that\nproposition across the group [and the pattern of dependence is the same\nacross propositions]. (Again, independence omits, and systematicity in-\ncludes, the neutrality clause in square brackets.)\nIndependence is a requirement of \u0091local\u0092 as opposed to \u0091holistic\u0092 com-\nmunication: The post-communication judgments on any proposition should\nbe determined by pre-communication judgments on that proposition and\nshould not depend on pre-communication judgments on other propositions.\nSystematicity adds to this a neutrality requirement across propositions. In\nthe climate change example, independence requires, for instance, that in-\ndividuals\u0092post-communication judgments on whether emissions above the\nrelevant threshold would lead to the speci\u0085ed temperature increase (\u0091if a\nthen b\u0092) depend only on pre-communication judgments on this proposition\nand not on pre-communication judgments on, say, whether emissions are in\nfact above the threshold (\u0091a\u0092). In the group membership example, to give\nanother illustration, independence requires that post-communication judg-\nments on whether a particular candidate should be granted membership\ndepend only on pre-communication judgments regarding this candidate, not\non pre-communication judgments regarding other candidates.\nWhether one considers independence plausible seems to depend, from\na normative perspective, on whether a focus on one proposition at a time\nis deemed desirable in group communication and, from a positive one, on\nwhether real-world communication processes display such a focus. However,\nthe most compelling justi\u0085cation of independence is that it is a necessary\ncondition for strategy-proofness. A communication process is strategy-proof\nif truthful expression of judgments is a weakly dominant strategy for every\nparticipant. Under su\u00a2 ciently permissive assumptions about individual in-\ncentives, the requirement of strategy-proofness is met if and only if the\ntransformation function satis\u0085es independence and another condition called\n19\nmonotonicity.37 If one considers strategy-proofness desirable, as many de-\nliberative democrats do, one may therefore have to endorse independence\ntoo.38 Moreover, independence also prevents various forms of agenda ma-\nnipulability, in which an agenda setter can manipulate the judgments on\nsome propositions by including others in the agenda or excluding them from\nit.39\nAlthough these \u0085ve requirements on group communication may seem\ninitially plausible, I now show that only a maximally conservative commu-\nnication process can meet them all. Although the proof turns out to be\nremarkably simple ex post, the result is nonetheless surprising ex ante. Re-\ncall that the identity function is the transformation function that maps every\npro\u0085le to itself.\nTheorem 2 The only transformation function satisfying universal domain,\nrational co-domain, consensus preservation, minimal relevance and indepen-\ndence\/systematicity is the identity function. (As before, whether the result\nrequires independence or systematicity depends on how the minimal com-\nplexity of the agenda is de\u0085ned.40)\n37This follows from related results on aggregation (Dietrich and List 2007c, Nehring and\nPuppe 2002). Monotonicity requires that any individual\u0092s post-communication acceptance\nof a given proposition should not be reversed if the pre-communication pro\u0085le changes\nsuch that one additional individual supports the proposition in question and all other\nindividuals\u0092judgments remain the same.\n38 Independence (with monotonicity) is also equivalent to non-manipulability (Dietrich\nand List 2007c). A transformation function is non-manipulable if there exist no pro-\n\u0085le, individuals i; j, and proposition \u0091p\u0092on the agenda such that i can manipulate j on\n\u0091p\u0092, i.e., (i) if i expresses his\/her pre-communication judgment set truthfully, then j\u0092s\npost-communication judgment on \u0091p\u0092disagrees with i\u0092s pre-communication judgment on\n\u0091p\u0092; and (ii) if i misrepresents his\/her pre-communication judgment set, then j\u0092s post-\ncommunication judgment on \u0091p\u0092agrees with i\u0092s pre-communication judgment on \u0091p\u0092. (The\ncase i = j rules out self-manipulation.)\n39Variants of this point have been established by List (2004) and Dietrich (2006) in the\ncontext of judgment aggregation, but carry over to judgment transformation.\n40Again, if the agenda meets only properties (i) and (ii), systematicity is needed for the\n20\nProof. Consider any transformation function satisfying the conditions\nof Theorem 2. Notice that this transformation function can be decomposed\ninto n separate functions, where the i-th such function maps each pro\u0085le of\nindividual judgment sets in the domain of the transformation function to\nindividual i\u0092s output judgment set. Formally, each of these n functions \u0096\nbeing a mapping from pro\u0085les of judgment sets to single judgment sets \u0096is\nan aggregation function. Its interpretation is obviously di\u00a4erent from the\nstandard one: It is not the group that faces an interpersonal aggregation\nproblem here, but each individual who faces an intrapersonal one, namely\nthe problem of how to reconcile the judgments of the other individuals with\nhis or her own judgments. Since the underlying transformation function\nsatis\u0085es universal domain, rational co-domain, consensus preservation and\nindependence\/systematicity \u0096the condition of minimal relevance is not yet\nused \u0096each induced aggregation function satis\u0085es universal domain, collec-\ntive rationality (here meaning rationality of the output judgment sets), con-\nsensus preservation and independence\/systematicity. By Theorem 1 above,\nit is therefore a dictatorship of one individual.41 This already shows that\nthe underlying transformation function must be an opinion leader function,\nwhere each individual adopts as his or her output judgment set the in-\nput judgment set of some antecedently \u0085xed individual, his or her opinion\nleader (the dictator in the terminology of the induced aggregation function).\nCould any individual\u0092s opinion leader be distinct from the individual him-\nor herself? Now the condition of minimal relevance comes into play. If\nany individual had another individual as his or her opinion leader, minimal\nrelevance would be violated contrary to the proof\u0092s assumption: The indi-\nvidual\u0092s output judgment set would be invariant under any changes of his or\nher input judgment set. Each individual must therefore be his or her own\nopinion leader. Consequently, the transformation function is the identity\nresult; if it also meets property (iii), independence is enough.\n41The quali\u0085cations regarding independence and systematicity in Theorem 1 (note 27)\napply here too and thus carry over to Theorem 2.\n21\nfunction. This completes the proof.\nTheorem 2 is an impossibility result, showing that \u0091e\u00a4ective\u0092group com-\nmunication is impossible under the given \u0085ve conditions. In particular, they\nimply the \u0091unchanging minds hypothesis\u0092: Under them, there is no opinion\nchange in communication. In consequence, the result casts doubt on these\nconditions.\nFrom a normative perspective, one does not want to impose conditions\non group communication that are so restrictive as to be met only by a de-\ngenerate communication process in which nobody ever changes his or her\njudgments. This would be against the spirit of the normative literature on\ndeliberative democracy. Further, Theorem 2 implies that the \u0085ve introduced\nconditions are inconsistent with the further condition of consensus gener-\nation discussed above, which is implicit in many writings on deliberative\ndemocracy, as illustrated by Elster\u0092s opening quote. If one did expect com-\nmunication to produce consensus, one could not also expect it to meet the\n\u0085ve introduced conditions.\nFrom an empirical perspective, although \u0091it is frequently observed\u0092, as\nMackie notes, \u0091that public deliberation on a pending item seldom seems to\nchange anyone\u0092s mind\u0092,42 group communication does not always exhibit the\nextreme conservatism implied by the theorem. There is plenty of empirical\nevidence that opinions do change in deliberative settings.43 Let me therefore\ngo through the conditions one by one and consider relaxing them.\n6 Mapping out the possibilities\n6.1 Relaxing universal domain\nUniversal domain requires the transformation function to cope with any\nlevel of pluralism in its input, subject only to the constraint of individual\n42See Mackie (2006, p. 279), as quoted above.\n43See, among many contributions, Luskin, Fishkin and Jowell (2002).\n22\nrationality. What happens if this is weakened to the requirement that it\nshould cope only with those input pro\u0085les that exhibit a certain amount\nof cohesion among the individuals? Then there exist transformation func-\ntions other than the identity function that satisfy all the other conditions.\nAn example is deference to the majority, which guarantees consistent post-\ncommunication judgments provided no pro\u0085les are deemed admissible in\nwhich distinct majorities support mutually inconsistent propositions. Could\npre-communication judgments exhibit this amount of cohesion?\nSuppose, for example, that even before communication the individuals\nagree on some cognitive or ideological dimension in terms of which to think\nabout the propositions on the agenda \u0096a \u0091meta-agreement\u0092\u0096and that, in\nconsequence, the individuals can be aligned from left to right on that dimen-\nsion such that, for each proposition on the agenda, the individuals accepting\nthe proposition are either all to the left, or all to the right, of those rejecting\nit.44 Deference to the majority is then guaranteed to yield consistent and\n\u0096absent ties \u0096complete post-communication judgments. Consider, for ex-\nample, the individual judgments over the agenda containing \u0092a\u0092, \u0091if a then b\u0092\nand \u0092b\u0092, as shown in Table 2, where the required left-right alignment of the\nindividuals \u0096here from 1 to 5 \u0096holds.\nInd. 1 Ind. 2 Ind. 3 Ind. 4 Ind. 5\n\u0091a\u0092 True False False False False\n\u0091if a then b\u0092 False True True True True\n\u0091b\u0092 False False False True True\nTable 2: Unidimensionally aligned judgments\nNotice that the majority judgments in Table 2 coincide with the judg-\nments of the median individual relative to the left-right alignment, here in-\ndividual 3. Generally, given any pro\u0085le of the form described, no proposition\ncan be supported by a majority unless it is also supported by the median in-\n44For a formal treatment of this kind of \u0091meta-agreement\u0092, see List (2002, 2003).\n23\nFigure 3: Single-peaked ranking judgments\ndividual. So, by deferring to the majority, individuals inherit the consistent\njudgments of the median individual.45 In this way, communication moves\nindividual opinions in a centrist direction.\nAnother type of cohesion su\u00a2 cient for consistent majority judgments ap-\nplies to ranking judgments, as in example 3 above. Note that an individual\u0092s\nset of ranking judgments can be viewed as expressing a ranking of the given\noptions (or candidates) from most to least preferable. Let some left-right\nordering of these options be given; this could order them from most socialist\nto most capitalist, from most secular to most religious, from most urban to\nmost rural, or in any other way. An individual\u0092s set of ranking judgments is\ncalled single-peaked relative to that left-right ordering if the individual has\na most highly ranked option somewhere on the ordering with a decreasing\nranking as options get more distant from it in either direction. This is il-\nlustrated by the two rankings in Figure 3 of the options x, y, z, v, w from\nmost (1st) to least (5th) preferable. A pro\u0085le (across individuals) is called\nsingle-peaked if there exists a left-right ordering of the options relative to\nwhich all individuals\u0092 ranking judgment sets are single-peaked. A classic\nresult by Duncan Black shows that, for any single-peaked pro\u0085le of ranking\n45Assuming full rationality of that individual, in accordance with universal domain.\n24\njudgments, the resulting majority judgments are consistent.46 Consequently,\nif pre-communication ranking judgments are single-peaked, individuals can\nform consistent post-communication judgments by deferring to the majority.\nDoes such pre-communication cohesion provide a plausible escape route\nfrom the impossibility result on judgment transformation? Although pre-\ncommunication pro\u0085les may sometimes exhibit the required amount of co-\nhesion, this cannot generally be assumed to be the case. Often the aim\nof communication is precisely to deal with pluralism. While consensus,\nor some other form of cohesion, may ideally be the output of communi-\ncation, requiring it as its input appears to miss the point of communication.\nNonetheless, one possible interpretation of the impossibility result is that, if\nrational co-domain, consensus preservation, minimal relevance and indepen-\ndence\/systematicity are required, then non-degenerate judgment transfor-\nmation is possible only if individuals enter the process with su\u00a2 cient initial\ncohesion.\n6.2 Relaxing rational co-domain\nRational co-domain requires the individuals\u0092 output judgment sets to be\nboth consistent and complete. Suppose this is weakened to the require-\nment that output judgment sets be merely consistent and deductively closed,\nwhere deductive closure means that individuals accept the implications of\nother accepted propositions, at least when they are also included in the\nagenda. Deductive closure is much less demanding than completeness,47 as\nit is satis\u0085ed, for example, even by an empty judgment set. Requiring de-\nductive closure, particularly in a deliberative setting, is plausible48 because\na frequently stated aim of proper deliberation is not just to lead people to\nform considered judgments on the propositions on the agenda but also to\n46See Black (1948). Single-peakedness is one particular su\u00a2 cient condition for consistent\nmajority ranking judgments. A more general condition is value-restriction (Sen 1966).\n47 In the presence of consistency.\n48At least when con\u0085ned to propositions on the agenda, as assumed here.\n25\nmake them aware of the implications of their judgments.\nWhat happens if rational co-domain is relaxed in this way? Unfortu-\nnately, it does not open up a compelling escape route from the impossibil-\nity result. Any transformation function satisfying the weakened co-domain\ncondition together with the other conditions \u0096universal domain, consensus\npreservation, minimal relevance, independence\/systematicity \u0096is of the fol-\nlowing form. For each individual, there exists a \u0085xed subset of individuals in\nwhich he or she is included \u0096his or her peer group (in the limiting case, this\ncould be the singleton set containing only the individual him- or herself) \u0096\nsuch that the individual\u0092s output judgment set is always the intersection of\nthe input judgment sets among the individual\u0092s peers.49 Arguably, such a\ntransformation function is no better, and possibly worse, than the identity\nfunction: It has the property that each individual\u0092s output judgment set is\nalways a subset of his or her input judgment set. At best an individual\u0092s\njudgment set remains unchanged after communication, at worst it shrinks.\nHow much it shrinks depends on the size of the individual\u0092s peer group and\nthe amount of disagreement among the peers. Such a transformation func-\ntion perhaps instantiates the combination of a conservative and a sceptical\nattitude: An individual never comes to accept a proposition he or she did\nnot accept in the \u0085rst place and never continues to accept a proposition\nunless everyone in his or her peer group agrees with it.\n6.3 Relaxing consensus preservation\nConsensus preservation is the requirement that the transformation function\nmap any unanimous pro\u0085le to itself. Relaxing this requirement is not a\nvery promising route. First, the requirement is already very mild, as argued\n49This follows from a result on judgment aggregation without full rationality (Diet-\nrich and List 2008, generalizing G\u00e4rdenfors 2006; see also Dokow and Holzman 2006).\nIt still holds if the transformation function admits as input any pro\u0085le of consistent\nand deductively closed judgment sets (not requiring completeness); a weakened indepen-\ndence\/systematicity condition su\u00a2 ces for the result.\n26\nabove. But, secondly, even if one were prepared to drop it, this would not\nlead very far: Under slightly stronger assumptions about how the proposi-\ntions on the agenda are interconnected, Theorem 2 continues to hold even\nwithout consensus preservation.50 I therefore set this route aside here.\n6.4 Relaxing minimal relevance\nMinimal relevance rules out that an individual\u0092s pre-communication judg-\nment set never makes any di\u00a4erence to his or her post-communication judg-\nment set. As in the case of consensus preservation, relaxing minimal rele-\nvance does not lead to a strong escape route from the impossibility theorem.\nNot only is minimal relevance a mild requirement, but, as shown in the proof\nof Theorem 2, its relaxation makes possible only a very restrictive class of\ntransformation functions, namely that of opinion leader functions. Under\nan opinion leader function, each individual adopts as his or her output judg-\nment set the input judgment set of an antecedently \u0085xed individual, the\nindividual\u0092s opinion leader. As noted, an opinion leader function is analo-\ngous to a dictatorial aggregation function except that di\u00a4erent individuals\nmay defer to di\u00a4erent opinion leaders. Obviously, such a transformation\nfunction is plausible at most in special circumstances, for example when\nindividuals have reasons to think that their opinion leaders have a special\nexpertise on the agenda of propositions under consideration.\n6.5 Relaxing independence\/systematicity\nIndependence requires the transformation function to determine each out-\nput judgment on any proposition solely on the basis of the individuals\u0092input\njudgments on that proposition, with systematicity requiring in addition that\n50 If systematicity is required, the relevant agenda assumption is the conjunction of (i),\n(ii) and a property called asymmetry ; this follows from a result by Dietrich (2007). If only\nindependence is required, the relevant agenda assumption is atomic closure or atomicity ;\nthis follows from results by Pauly and van Hees (2006) and Dietrich (2006).\n27\nthe pattern of dependence be the same across propositions. As noted above,\nthis can be viewed as a constraint of \u0091local\u0092deliberation, requiring the con-\nsideration of one proposition at a time. Given the limited appeal of the\nprevious escape routes from the impossibility result, it seems natural to\nrelax independence.\nIf we give it up, one possibility is for each individual to designate some\npropositions on the agenda as \u0091premises\u0092 and others as \u0091conclusions\u0092 and\nto generate his or her post-communication judgments by deferring to the\npre-communication majority judgment on each premise and then deriving\nthe judgments on other propositions from these majority judgments on the\npremises. If the premises are chosen as a \u0091logical basis\u0092for the entire agenda\n\u0096that is, they are mutually independent and any assignment of truth-values\nto them settles the truth-values of all other propositions \u0096the resulting trans-\nformation function guarantees consistent and complete post-communication\njudgments and satis\u0085es all the other conditions introduced above. The choice\nof premises and conclusions need not be the same across individuals.\nWhile the present class of transformation functions is the judgment-\ntransformation analogue of the \u0091premise-based procedures\u0092in the context of\naggregation, a more general class of transformation functions draws on the\n\u0091sequential priority procedures\u0092of aggregation.51 Here each individual deter-\nmines a particular order of priority among the propositions on the agenda,\ninterpreting earlier propositions in that order as epistemically (or otherwise)\nprior to later ones. The individual then considers the propositions one-by-\none in the chosen order and forms his or her post-communication judgment\non each proposition as follows. If the pre-communication majority judgment\non the proposition is consistent with the judgments the individual has made\non propositions considered earlier, then he or she defers to that majority\njudgment; but if it is inconsistent with those earlier judgments, then he or\nshe accepts the implications of those earlier judgments. In the case of Table\n51On these two kinds of procedures of aggregation, see Pettit (2001) and List (2004),\nrespectively.\n28\n1, for example, an individual may consider the propositions in the order \u0091a\u0092,\n\u0091if a then b\u0092, \u0091b\u0092 (with negations interspersed) and then accept \u0091a\u0092and \u0091if\na then b\u0092by deferring to the pre-communication majority judgments while\naccepting \u0092b\u0092by logical inference. The output pro\u0085le under such a trans-\nformation function is sensitive to each individual\u0092s chosen order of priority\namong the propositions. This property of the transformation function can\nbe seen as a virtue or as a vice, depending on one\u0092s perspective. On the one\nhand, it takes into account the fact that di\u00a4erent propositions may have a\ndi\u00a4erent status.52 But on the other hand, it makes individuals manipulable\nby a cunning Rikerian \u0091heresthetician\u0092who leads them to consider propo-\nsitions in a strategically adjusted order.53 In the next section, I discuss a\nthird and arguably particularly interesting class of transformation functions\nthat becomes possible once independence\/systematicity is dropped.\nWhat is the cost of violating independence? As already noted, a trans-\nformation function violating it may be susceptible to strategic agenda set-\nting as well as provide incentives for strategic misrepresentation of pre-\ncommunication judgments. To illustrate the latter, consider the climate\nchange example with individual judgments as shown in Table 1 above, and\nsuppose the experts form their post-communication judgments in the se-\nquential manner just described, considering the propositions in the order\n\u0091a\u0092, \u0091if a then b\u0092, \u0091b\u0092. Suppose, further, that the second expert, who does not\naccept that there will be the speci\u0085ed temperature increase (proposition \u0091b\u0092),\ndoes not want his or her colleagues to accept that proposition either. Under\nthe sequential transformation function, he or she may lead them to accept\n\u0091not b\u0092by misrepresenting his or her judgment on \u0091a\u0092, strategically express-\ning the view that \u0091not a\u0092. Such possibilities of strategic manipulation arise\nas soon as the transformation function violates independence.54 The impos-\nsibility theorem presented can therefore be seen as describing a dilemma be-\n52E.g., Pettit (2001) and Chapman (2002).\n53See Riker (1986) and List (2004).\n54See notes 37 and 38.\n29\ntween two problems of a group communication process: \u0091unchanging minds\u0092\non the one hand and strategic manipulability on the other.\n7 Away from consensus\nWhile proponents of deliberative democracy sometimes expect group com-\nmunication to bring about consensus, there is very little empirical evidence\nof this e\u00a4ect.55 It is also unclear whether achieving consensus is always nor-\nmatively desirable. Moreover, if we do require transformation functions to\nsatisfy consensus generation, then the problem of judgment transformation\nformally collapses into that of judgment aggregation, and the only remaining\ntransformation functions satisfying universal domain, rational co-domain,\nconsensus preservation and independence\/systematicity \u0096dropping minimal\nrelevance \u0096are those opinion leader functions in which all individuals defer\nto the same opinion leader, the equivalent of an Arrovian dictator. This\nis particularly ironic in so far as the possibility of a deliberation-induced\nconsensus is often proposed as a solution to, not a variant of, the notorious\nproblem of aggregation.\nCould group communication bring about something less than consensus\nthat is still helpful for democratic decision-making \u0096 for example, by fa-\ncilitating the consistent aggregation of post-communication judgments? A\nrecent literature suggests that the kind of group communication envisaged\nby deliberative democrats may have this e\u00a4ect, at least under favourable\nconditions.56 Recall the earlier discussion of the possibility that individu-\nals agree on some cognitive or ideological dimension in terms of which to\nthink about the relevant propositions or, in the case of ranking judgments,\n55For evidence from deliberative polls, see List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean\n(2000\/2006).\n56See notes 2 and 10. William Riker (1982, p. 128) conceded that \u0091[i]f, by reason of\ndiscussion, debate, civic education, and political socialization, voters have a common view\nof the political dimension ..., then a transitive outcome is guaranteed.\u0092\n30\nthe candidates or policy options. While such \u0091meta-agreement\u0092may be too\ndemanding as a pre-condition for communication, it can more plausibly be\nexpected as its outcome. In an empirical study using data from James\nFishkin\u0092s deliberative polls, such an e\u00a4ect has been identi\u0085ed.57 Groups of\nbetween 150 and 350 randomly sampled participants were interviewed on\ntheir ranking judgments over multiple policy options both before and after\na period of group deliberation. Deliberation increased the proximity of these\nranking judgments to single-peakedness, as de\u0085ned above \u0096a deliberation-\ninduced movement towards \u0091meta-agreement\u0092.\nCan we \u0085nd an empirically plausible class of transformation functions\nto explain this e\u00a4ect? Let me introduce the class of constrained minimal\nrevision functions. Under such a function, the transformation of judgments\ntakes place in two stages. An input pro\u0085le is given. At the \u0085rst stage, the\ngroup identi\u0085es a particular set of judgment sets that are deemed admissible\nas output judgment sets conditional on the given input pro\u0085le. Formally,\nthis can be modelled as the application of a focusing function, which maps\nthe input pro\u0085le to a set of admissible output judgment sets. The latter set\nshould ideally have the property that any pro\u0085le constructible from it leads\nto consistent majority judgments. At the second stage, each individual\nselects an output judgment set from the identi\u0085ed set of admissible ones.\nFormally, this can be modelled as the application of a minimal judgment\nrevision policy, under which each individual chooses an output judgment set\nfrom the set of admissible ones that is as close as possible to his or her input\njudgment set, relative to some distance metric over judgment sets.58 This\n\u0085xes the output pro\u0085le and thereby completes the de\u0085nition.\nInformally, the \u0085rst stage involves the identi\u0085cation of the opinions that\ncan \u0091reasonably\u0092be held after group communication given the opinions be-\nfore communication; and the second stage involves a change of individual\nopinions such that each individual ends up holding one of the \u0091reasonable\u0092\n57See List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean (2000\/2006).\n58On the notion of minimal revision, see, e.g., Schulte (2005).\n31\nones. Whether an individual\u0092s post-communication opinion coincides with\nhis or her pre-communication opinion depends on whether it was already\namong the ones identi\u0085ed as \u0091reasonable\u0092during the \u0085rst stage of the process.\nCrucially, two ingredients of this de\u0085nition allow a number of di\u00a4er-\nent speci\u0085cations: the group\u0092s focusing function at the \u0085rst stage, and each\nindividual\u0092s distance metric over judgment sets at the second. Thus the\nde\u0085nition speci\u0085es an entire class of transformation functions, one for each\npossible speci\u0085cation of these two ingredients.\nTo illustrate how a constrained minimal revision function can bring\nabout a \u0091meta-agreement\u0092, suppose again a group deliberates about how\nto rank three or more policy options in an order of social preference (exam-\nple 3), as in the deliberative polls studied empirically. The following con-\nstrained minimal revision function generates single-peaked output pro\u0085les.\nFor a given pre-communication pro\u0085le, it is \u0085rst determined which left-right\nordering of the options renders a maximal number of individuals\u0092ranking\njudgment sets single-peaked, as de\u0085ned above.59 Now a ranking judgment\nset is deemed admissible if and only if it is single-peaked relative to the\nidenti\u0085ed left-right ordering. This speci\u0085es the group\u0092s focusing function\nand completes the \u0085rst stage. Each individual then minimally revises his or\nher ranking judgment set so as to adopt one of the admissible ones; here an\nindividual\u0092s distance metric could be the Hamming distance, whereby the\ndistance between any two judgment sets is the number of propositions on the\nagenda on which these judgment sets disagree.60 This determines the post-\ncommunication pro\u0085le and completes the second stage. By construction,\nthis transformation function guarantees a single-peaked output pro\u0085le.\nFurther empirical research is needed to test whether a suitable con-\n59 In List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean (2000\/2006), such a left-right ordering is called\na largest structuring dimension.\n60The Hamming distance has been applied to judgment aggregation by Pigozzi (2006).\nIn the case of ranking judgment sets it captures the so-called Kemeny distance between\nthe underlying preference rankings.\n32\nstrained minimal revision function can explain the precise patterns of\ndeliberation-induced opinion change observed in deliberative polls and other\nexperiments. To the best of my knowledge, however, the present approach is\nthe \u0085rst attempt to model a deliberation-induced \u0091meta-agreement\u0092formally.\nFrom a normative perspective, further questions need to be asked on\nwhether a suitable constrained minimal revision function captures the re-\nquirements of a good communication process as discussed in the literature\non deliberative democracy. A constrained minimal revision function satis\u0085es\nuniversal domain, rational co-domain, consensus preservation and minimal\nrelevance, while violating independence\/systematicity, but does it also sat-\nisfy some other desiderata of properly \u0091deliberative\u0092communication?\nObviously, it does not generally satisfy consensus generation, unless the\nfocusing function always picks out only one admissible output judgment\nset for each input pro\u0085le. What about some other conditions? As already\nillustrated, a constrained minimal revision function may satisfy cohesion\ngeneration, where a pro\u0085le is de\u0085ned to be cohesive if it generates consis-\ntent majority judgments. Cohesion generation is a particularly appealing\ncondition when the communication process precedes a majority decision.\nAnother condition is stability under repeated rounds of communication,\nthe requirement that the transformation function map any output pro\u0085le\n(that is, any pro\u0085le in the function\u0092s range) to itself, or equivalently, that\nrepeated applications of the function lead to the same output as a single\napplication.61 A constrained minimal revision function satis\u0085es this condi-\ntion so long as the group\u0092s focusing function and the individuals\u0092distance\n61Any transformation function satisfying both consensus preservation and consensus\ngeneration also satis\u0085es this condition, because its \u0085rst application leads to a unanimous\npro\u0085le and subsequent applications preserve this unanimity. By contrast, suppose the\nmembers of a group sit around a circular table and each individual defers to his or her\nneighbour on the right in forming his or her post-communication judgments. This trans-\nformation function \u0096a special kind of opinion leader function \u0096violates the stability con-\ndition, as each round of transformation yields a further permutation of the given pro\u0085le\nacross individuals.\n33\nmetrics are su\u00a2 ciently well-behaved.62 Whether stability under repeated\nrounds of communication is a plausible requirement depends on how the\njudgment transformation function is interpreted. If it is meant to capture\nopinion change in a single round of group communication, then there is\nno reason to expect subsequent rounds of communication to leave opinions\n\u0085xed. But if it is meant to capture a complete communication process up\nto the point of \u0091re\u0087ective equilibrium\u0092,63 then the stability condition is very\nplausible, arguably more so than consensus generation.\n8 Conclusion\nI have formalized the problem of judgment transformation and proved a\nbaseline impossibility result. My approach opens up a new way of analyzing\ngroup communication processes axiomatically, which allows us to determine\nwhich combinations of conditions on such processes are compatible with\ne\u00a4ective opinion change and which are not. Among the \u0085ve basic condi-\ntions introduced, the \u0085rst four, I have argued, can be relaxed only in special\ncases. The most plausible candidate for relaxation \u0096under both normative\nand positive interpretations of the model \u0096 is the \u0085fth condition: indepen-\ndence\/systematicity.\nThis observation suggests that e\u00a4ective group communication processes\nas envisaged by deliberative democrats must exhibit a certain kind of holism:\nThe objects of judgment transformation cannot generally be single proposi-\ntions in isolation, but must be larger \u0091webs\u0092of interconnected propositions.\nAs noted, this holistic property of group communication is analogous to\nthe holistic property of theory testing in science. In empirical science, too,\n62The focusing function must have the property that it maps any output pro\u0085le con-\nstructed from any set of judgment sets in its range to a new set of judgment sets that still\ncontains all the judgment sets in the given output pro\u0085le. The distance metric must have\nthe standard property that the distance of any judgment set from itself is uniquely zero.\n63E.g., Rawls (1971).\n34\nwe cannot generally adjudicate single propositions in isolation, but only in\nconjunction with other logically connected propositions.\nAt one level, this is perhaps an unsurprising result. However, the cost of\nthis holism in communication, as I have pointed out, is strategic manipula-\nbility: Individuals may be able to in\u0087uence post-communication judgments\non some propositions in a preferred manner by misrepresenting their pre-\ncommunication judgments on others. The communicative process may also\nbe open to agenda manipulation. Thus we are faced with a trade-o\u00a4between\ntwo problematic features of group communication: \u0091unchanging minds\u0092on\nthe one hand and strategic manipulability on the other. This trade-o\u00a4,\nI think, is quite fundamental: Under a broad range of conditions, group\ncommunication processes either fail to be properly deliberative or violate\nstrategy-proofness. We cannot generally have both: e\u00a4ective communication\nthat changes minds and strategy-proofness.\nLet me conclude with some remarks about how the present approach\nis related to game-theoretic approaches to studying group communication.\nWhile game-theoretic approaches seek to come up with a behavioural the-\nory of group communication, analyzing individuals\u0092 incentives in commu-\nnicative processes and predicting their behaviour on this basis,64 the goal of\nthe present approach is to map out the logical space of possible functional\nrelations between pre- and post-communication judgments. The present ap-\nproach is thus more akin to social choice theory in the tradition of Arrow\nthan to game theory, and the relationship between the two approaches is\nsimilar to that between social choice theory and the theory of mechanism\ndesign, which has recently received a lot of attention following the award\nof the 2007 Nobel Prizes in Economics.65 The former investigates possi-\nble functional relations between individual inputs and social outputs and\nthe latter investigates the various mechanisms available (or unavailable) for\nimplementing these functional relations under certain incentive constraints.\n64See note 3.\n65See the survey article by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2007).\n35\nTherefore I see the present approach as complementary to game-theoretic\napproaches, not as competitive.\nIn addition, there are important bridges between the two approaches.\nSince the condition of independence can be motivated game-theoretically \u0096\nas a requirement for the incentive-compatibility of truthfulness \u0096my con-\nclusion that realistic group communication processes are likely to violate\nit reinforces a central game-theoretic question about group communication:\nHow can we design communication processes that induce participants to\nreveal their judgments truthfully? Broadly, there are at least two ways to\ntackle this question. One may either go along the mechanism-design route\nand ask what communication processes ensure truthfulness by eliminating\nopportunities to bene\u0085t from strategic misrepresentation. Or one may go\nalong a psychological route and ask under what conditions individuals are\ntruthful even in the presence of strategic opportunities. Which of these\nroutes \u0096or which combination of them \u0096is most promising remains a ques-\ntion for future research.\n9 References\nAlchourr\u00f3n, C. E., P. G\u00e4rdenfors and D.
