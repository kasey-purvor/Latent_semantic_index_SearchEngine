Analytic theory and analog and digital experiments show that the system dynamics\nduring escape exhibit a symmetry-breaking transition as the width of the fluctuational spectral peak is\nvaried. For double-well potentials, even a small asymmetry may result in a parametrically large difference\nof the activation energies for escape from different wells.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.\u2013a, 05.60.Cd, 73.50.Jt, 73.50.TdThe problem of diffusion and activated escape in sys-\ntems away from thermal equilibrium is attracting increas-\ning attention in diverse contexts, from crystal growth [1]\nto switching of current in microstructures [2], modes in\nlasers [3], and biological systems [4]. In many cases the\nsystem of interest is nonequilibrium because it is driven\nby nonthermal noise. Such noise can give rise to new and\ninteresting phenomena, e.g., the onset of directed diffusion\nin a spatially periodic potential (ratchet) [5], in which case\nthe diffusion rate and direction depend on the shape of the\nnoise power spectrum F\u0001v\u0002 [6,7].\nOne would expect the escape probabilities to be deter-\nmined by F\u0001v\u0002 for v & t21r ,vy where tr and vy are the\ncharacteristic relaxation time and vibrational frequency of\nthe system. However, the situation is more complicated in\nthe important case of quasimonochromatic noise (QMN)\nwhere F\u0001v\u0002 has a peak at a comparatively high frequency\nv0 \u00bf t21r ,vy [8\u201310]. Here, the optimal fluctuation for\nescape may correspond to \u201cfluctuational preparation of the\nbarrier,\u201d analogous to phonon-induced barrier preparation\nin solids [11]. The system is forced by the noise to fluc-\ntuate at frequency \u0003v0. As the amplitude of such random\nvibrations increases, the shape of the effective potential for\ntheir center of motion qc alters, as illustrated for the case\nof a bistable potential in Fig. 1. For a large enough am-\nplitude, the initially occupied metastable potential well for\nqc may disappear, so that the system then escapes from\nit. Such an adiabatic escape scenario, during which the\nsystem is most likely to move along an oscillating path,\nwas predicted [8] and observed [9] for the case where the\nhalf-width of the peak in the noise spectrum G \u00f8 t21r . Re-\ncent numerical analysis indicates [10] that, as G increases\nto \u0004t21r , the most probable escape path (MPEP) becomes\nsmooth.\nIn this Letter we show that the transition with changing\nnoise spectrum between different types of MPEPs, and thus\nbetween escape scenarios, is a symmetry-breaking transi-\ntion. The symmetry is broken in time: it corresponds to\nthe onset of fast oscillations of the MPEP, with an arbitrary\ninitial phase, to leading order. We find the location of this0031-9007\u000600\u000684(24)\u00065470(4)$15.00transition and show that, at the transition, the activation en-\nergy of escape displays a nonanalytic dependence on the\nnoise color parameter.\nThe second effect that we discuss occurs when there is\nan asymmetry in the potential. Even a small asymmetry\nmay lead to a parametrically large difference in the activa-\ntion energies of interwell transitions in opposite directions,\ngiving rise to a dc current in a periodic potential or to strong\neffective localization in one of the wells of a double-well\npotential.\nWe will consider such effects for an overdamped system\nfluctuating in a double-well potential U\u0001q\u0002 (cf. Fig. 1),\nwith equation of motion\n\u0001q \u0002 2U 0\u0001q\u0002 1 f\u0001t\u0002 . (1)\nHere, f\u0001t\u0002 is a quasimonochromatic noise. An example of\nQMN is provided by Brownian motion of an underdamped\nharmonic oscillator, which is described by the equation\nFIG. 1.

For small G\u0006v0, the\npower spectrum F\u0001v\u0002 of the noise f\u0001t\u0002 has a narrow\nLorentzian peak at v0, of half-width G. The probability\ndensity of realizations of f\u0001t\u0002 is ~ exp\u00012R0\tf\n\u0006D\u02dc\u0002 [12],\nwith\nR0\tf\n \u0002 14\nZ `\n2`\ndt \tM\u02c6f\u0001t\u0002\n2. (3)\nThe probabilities Wnm of fluctuational transitions be-\ntween the potential wells n \u0002 1, 2 of U\u0001q\u0002 can be obtained\n[8,13] (see also [14]) using Feynman\u2019s idea [12] that the\ntrajectory of the system q\u0001t\u0002 is uniquely determined by\nthe force f\u0001t\u0002. Different realizations of f\u0001t\u0002 can lead to\na transition, but for small noise intensity D\u02dc, their proba-\nbility densities are exponentially different. To logarithmic\naccuracy, Wnm is determined by the probability density of\nthe most probable realization, i.e., the one that minimizes\nR0\tf\n subject to the constraint (1). In such an optimal\nfluctuation, the system is driven along an instantonlike op-\ntimal path q\u0001t\u0002 from the bottom qn of the nth well, which\nis occupied for t ! 2`, to the top of the potential barrier\nqb between the wells for t ! `, and the driving optimal\nforce f\u0001t\u0002 ! 0 for t ! 6` [8]. The optimal trajectories\nq\u0001t\u0002, f\u0001t\u0002 provide a minimum to the functional\nR\tf, q\n \u0002 R0\tf\n 1\nZ `\n2`\ndt l\u0001t\u0002 \t \u0001q 1 U 0 2 f\u0001t\u0002\n ,\n(4)\nwhere l\u0001t\u0002 is a Lagrange multiplier. The escape rate\nW ~ exp\u00012R\u0006D\u02dc\u0002, R \u0002 minR\tf, q\n . (5)\nWe will investigate QMN-activated escape in the\nmost interesting case where Gtr can be arbitrary, but\nthe characteristic noise frequency v0 \u00bf G, 1\u0006tr [tr \u0002\nmaxn\t1\u0006U 00\u0001qn\u0002\n is the relaxation time of the system]. In\nthis case the Euler equations for the functional (4) can\nbe analyzed [8] using a standard averaging method. The\nmotion of the system is a superposition of fast vibrations\nat frequency v0 and slow motion of the vibration center\nqc,\nq\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 qc\u0001t\u0002 1\nX\na\u00026\nqa exp\u0001iav0t\u0002 . (6)\nThe two motions are mixed by the nonlinearity of the po-\ntential U\u0001q\u0002. The time evolution of qc and of q1 \u0002 q\u00012\noccurs on the scale 1\u0006G, tr and is determined by the time-\naveraged potential V \u0001qc, q1, q2\u0002,\nV \u0002\n1\n2p\nZ 2p\n0\ndfU\u0001qc 1 q1eif 1 q2e2if\u0002 . (7)To lowest order in G\u0006v0, 1\u0006v0tr , the variational prob-\nlem (4) can be reduced [15] to a much simpler one, R \u0002\nminR\u00af\tqc, q6\n, with\nR\u00af\tqc, q6\n \u0002 12 v\n4\n0\nZ\ndt L\u0001 \u0001qc, qc; \u0001q6, q6\u0002 ,\nL \u0002\n1\n2\n\u0001 \u0001qc 1 V 0c\u0002\n2 1 4\u0001 \u0001q1 \u0001q2 1 G2q1q2\u0002 ,\n(8)\nwhere V 0c \u0002 \u2260V\u0006\u2260qc. The functional R\u00af takes the form\nof a classical action for a particle with coordinates qc, q6\nand a Lagrangian L. Escape is determined by the extreme\ntrajectory which starts from qc \u0002 qn, q6 \u0002 0 for t ! 2`\nand approaches qc \u0002 qb , q6 \u0002 0 as t ! `.\nFrom (8), the equation for q6 is of the form\n2q\u00a8a 1\n1\n4\n\u0001 \u0001qc 1 V 0c\u0002V\n00\nc,2a 1 G\n2qa \u0002 0, a \u0002 6 ,\n(9)\nwhere V 00c,a \u0002 \u22602V\u0006\u2260qc\u2260qa . The potential V (7) depends\non q1,q2 only in terms of the product q1q2. Therefore\nthe phase argq1 \u0002 2 argq2 is a cyclic variable. From (8),\nR\u00af is minimal for \u0001d\u0006dt\u0002 argq1 \u0002 0, and so by choosing\nthe time origin in (6) one can make q1\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 q2\u0001t\u0002. An-\nother important consequence is that Eq. (9) has a trivial\nsolution q6\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 0. It corresponds to a smooth (nonoscil-\nlating) optimal path q\u0001t\u0002, with\n\u0001qc\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 \u0001q\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 V 0c\u0001qc, 0, 0\u0002 \u0002 U\n0\u0001q\u0002 . (10)\nThe path \u0001q \u0002 U 0\u0001q\u0002 is the well-known solution for the\nMPEP in an overdamped system in thermal equilibrium.\nSuch a system is described by (1) with f\u0001t\u0002 being white\nnoise with a flat power spectrum of height 2kBT . In the\npresent case the solution (10) arises because the noise spec-\ntrum F\u0001v\u0002 has a broad low-frequency plateau, of width\nv0 which is parametrically larger than the relaxation rate\nof the system, and of height 2D\u02dc\u0006v40 . Correspondingly,\nR \u0002 v40DU [DU \u0002 U\u0001qb\u0002 2 U\u0001qn\u0002], and the escape rate\nW ~ exp\u00012v40DU\u0006D\u02dc\u0002.\nThe smooth optimal path (10) provides a minimum to\nthe functional R\u00af if the eigenvalue problem\nZ\ndt0\nX\nj\n\td2R\u00af\u0006dqi\u0001t\u0002dqj\u0001t0\u0002\ncnj\u0001t0\u0002 \u0002 lncni\u0001t\u0002 (11)\nhas only non-negative eigenvalues ln [here, i, j \u0002 c,6,\nand the derivatives are calculated for the path (10),\ncni\u00016`\u0002 \u0002 0].

The smooth path (10) is indeed\nthe optimal escape path in this case.\nAs Gtr decreases, the lowest eigenvalue of (12) l0 may\nbecome equal to zero. This signals instability of the solu-\ntion (10) and defines the critical Gcr where it occurs. For\nstill smaller G the minimum of R\u00af is provided by the solu-\ntion with finite q6. From (6), such a solution oscillates in\ntime, with an arbitrary phase in the approximation (8), i.e.,\nthe time symmetry of the MPEP is spontaneously broken.\nThe activation energy R is a nonanalytic function of G\nfor G \u0002 Gcr . The situation is similar to a second order\nphase transition, with R\u00af and c06\u0001t\u0002 playing the roles of\nthe free energy functional and the soft mode. Indeed, for\nsmall jG 2 Gcr j, one can expand the functional R\u00af\tqc, q6\n\n(8) in deviations dqi \u0002\nP\ncncni of the actual trajectory\nfrom the extreme path (10), with cni being the normal-\nized eigenfunctions of (11) for G \u0002 Gcr . The coefficient\nof jc0j2 in dR\u00af\u0006v40 is 2\u0001G2 2 G2cr \u0002. Therefore c0 plays\nthe role of an order parameter. For G . Gcr the mini-\nmum of R\u00af is reached for c0 \u0002 0. For G , Gcr , it is\nreached for finite jc0j determined by higher-order terms\nin the expansion of R\u00af. The nontrivial part of dR\u00af\u0006v40 ,\nafter appropriate renormalization, takes the familiar form\najc0j4 1 2\u0001G2 2 G2cr \u0002 jc0j2, with a being a G-independent\nconstant. Therefore R\u0006v40 \u0002 DU 2 \u0001G2 2 G2cr \u00022\u0006a for\nG , Gcr , and d2R\u0006dG2 is discontinuous for G \u0002 Gcr .\nAway from Gcr , the prefactor in the escape rate is deter-\nmined by the eigenvalues ln (cf. [16]). It blows up as G\napproaches Gcr .\nWe note an interesting similarity between the above\ntime-symmetry-breaking transition and breaking of\nthe spatial symmetry of the MPEP in two-variable\nwhite-noise-driven systems that was first found and inves-\ntigated by Maier and Stein [17]. As in (8), the Lagrangian\nfor the optimal fluctuational paths analyzed in Ref. [17]\nwas even in one of the variables. In a way, a one-variable\nQMN-driven system provides a natural realization of the\nmodel [17].\nA solution of the variational problem (8) that is quali-\ntatively different from (10) can be obtained in the limit\nof small Gtr [8]. It has the form q6\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 q\u00010\u00021 exp\u00012Gjtj\u0002\nfor jtj\u0006tr \u00bf \u0001Gtr \u000221\u00062, with V 0c\u0001qc, q6\u0002 \u0002 0. This solu-\ntion corresponds to the vibration center qc following the\nincrease of q6 adiabatically and staying at the minimum\nof the average potential V for given q6 until this minimum\nmerges with the barrier top (see Fig. 1). This occurs for\nsome q1 \u0002 q2 \u0002 q\u00010\u00021 such that V\n0\nc \u0002 V\n00\ncc \u0002 0. From (8)\nR \u0002 4v40Gjq\u00010\u00021 j2. (13)\nThe above solution corresponds to the \u201cbarrier prepa-\nration\u201d for the vibration center qc by the slowly varying\nvibration amplitude q6 [8] and gives an activation energy\nproportional to the small parameter G. However, it applies\nonly if the potential minimum of V from which the system5472escapes merges with the barrier top with increasing q6.\nIt is clear from Fig. 1 that, in the case of an asymmetric\ndouble-well potential, this only happens for one of the\nwells. For the other well, the barrier for qc remains fi-\nnite for all q6. Therefore the value of R, although less\nthan v40DU, is not proportional to G. This means that,\neven for a weakly asymmetric potential, activation en-\nergies of escape from different wells are parametrically\ndifferent. Similarly, for a periodic potential of the ratchet\ntype (see [5]), the activation energies for diffusion in oppo-\nsite directions differ, leading to strongly directed diffusion\nfor low noise intensities [15].\nTo test these predictions, we have performed analog\nand digital simulations of a QMN-driven system. The\ntechniques are described in [18]. The activation energies\nwere extracted from measured escape rates as functions of\nnoise intensity. We chose the simplest system: a biased\ndouble-well Duffing oscillator, with potential\nU\u0001q\u0002 \u0002 2\n1\n2\nq2 1\n1\n4\nq4 2 Aq . (14)\nFor A \u0002 0 the two wells are symmetrical.

The critical value Gcr ,\nwhere time symmetry of the MPEP (10) breaks down, can\nbe obtained from Eq. (12) using the explicit form of the\noptimal path (10) qc\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 7 exp\u00012t\u00062\u0002 \u00012 cosht\u000221\u00062 [the\nsigns 7 correspond to escape from the left and right\nwells of U\u0001q\u0002, respectively].

As\nexpected for a symmetry-breaking transition, R \u0002 const\nfor G . 1\u00062, whereas dR ~ \u0001G 2 Gcr \u00022 for small posi-\ntive Gcr 2 G. The data are in excellent agreement with\nthe results (crosses) obtained by solving the Euler equa-\ntions for the reduced functional R\u00af (8). They are also close\nto results (squares) obtained from the Euler equations for\nthe functional R (4) [8] using the numerical method of\nEinchcomb and McKane [10(b)]. At criticality the ex-\ntreme paths of R\u00af, which emanate from \u0001jqcj \u0002 1, q6 \u0002\n0\u0002, are focused at the barrier top q6 \u0002 qc \u0002 0 (see inset\nof Fig. 2), which gives rise to blowing up of the prefac-\ntor in the escape rate. Similar focusing was observed and\ncarefully analyzed at a spatial symmetry-breaking transi-\ntion in a white-noise-driven system [17].\nFor A fi 0 the potential (14) is asymmetric. Break-\ning of the time symmetry of the MPEP occurs in both\nwells, but for different G. For the well at positive q\nin Fig. 1 (well 1), Gcr 2 1\u00062 \u0002 2A\u0006p , to first order\nin A. This well is deeper for A . 0 [clearly, the es-\ncape activation energy R1\u0001A\u0002 \u0002 R2\u00012A\u0002]. This means\nthat the fluctuational barrier preparation in the deeper\nwell starts for larger G. Therefore, unexpectedly, the\nratio r \u0002 R1\u0006R2 is a nonmonotonic function of G.\nVOLUME 84, NUMBER 24 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 12 JUNE 2000FIG. 2.

Inset: Trajectories for the Lagrangian\n(8) that start from qc \u0002 21,q1 \u0002 q2 \u0002 0 for t ! 2` and are\nfocused into the barrier top qc \u0002 q6 \u0002 0 for G \u0002 Gcr .\nFor large G both R1 and R2 are independent of G,\nand r \u0002 const . 1 for A . 0. As G decreases, R1\nstarts decreasing first, and r decreases. However, with\nfurther decrease in G, r starts sharply increasing, as seen\nin Fig. 3. This happens because, for small G, it is only for\nthe shallow well that the barrier of the average potential\nV can disappear, as seen in Fig. 1. Therefore R2 ~ G\nfor small G, and r becomes large; see Fig. 3. It is\nseen from Fig. 1 that the MPEPs in different wells have\nalready become very different even when G has fallen\nonly slightly below Gcr .\nFIG. 3. The ratio of the activation energies of escape r \u0002\nR1\u0006R2 from the wells 1 and 2 of the biased Duffing oscilla-\ntor (14).In conclusion, for bistable systems driven by a quasi-\nmonochromatic noise the activation energies of escape\nfrom different wells are parametrically different, as are\nalso the activation energies for diffusion in opposite di-\nrections in a periodic potential. This allows the use of\nQMN for highly selective species separation. The tran-\nsition from most probable escape along a smooth path, to\nthat along an oscillating path, is a symmetry-breaking tran-\nsition. The second derivative of the activation energy with\nrespect to the bandwidth of the noise is discontinuous at the\ntransition.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions and\ncorrespondence with A.
