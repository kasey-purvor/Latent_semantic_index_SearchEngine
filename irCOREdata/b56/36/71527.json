However, informed consent is for the competent, \nrights-bearing individual: focussing on the individual, it thus neglects social, \neconomic and even political matters; focussing on the competent rights-bearer, it does \nnot serve situations where consent is plainly inappropriate (eg, the young child) or \nwhere coercion can obviously be justified (the criminal). \n \nUsing the British experience of large-scale biobanking, I argue that the focus on \nconsenting individuals distorts our ways of thinking about biobanks and has serious \npractical ramifications. This becomes clear if we contrast the case of adult biobanks \nintended for medical research with two other forms of biobanking. Thus child cohort \nstudies \u2013 vital for sound scientific investigation of the interplay of genetics and \nenvironment in health \u2013 have been very badly funded next to adult studies. On the \nother hand, forensic databases have attracted massive investment, but little debate \u2013 \npartly owing to a sense that here, at least, is a case where consent is not relevant. \n \nContrasting these central types of biobanking, I will suggest that there are powerful \nfactors at work in limiting \u2018ethics\u2019 to individual rights. Projects of this size should \ndirect our attention to more overtly political questions concerning priority setting and \norganisation of medical research. \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn this paper I wish to cast a critical eye at the way in which we \u2013 meaning both \nbioethicists and practitioners \u2013 frame ethical and bioethical discussion. A slow swell \nof protest has been gathering, from many directions, against the idea that protection of \nindividual rights should be the central focus of bioethical concern.1 Nonetheless, \nstandard assumptions, and powerful institutions, continue to equate (bio)ethics with \nthe protection of individual patients or research subjects \u2013 protections most often \nframed in terms of confidentiality and informed consent.2\n \nMy discussion will be particularly concerned with large-scale biobanks, and the \ndifficulties that we have experienced in deciding \u2013 or discovering \u2013 the principles by \nwhich they might be regulated and governed. Part of our difficulty has come from the \nfact that biobanking is in fact highly variegated in form: many different sorts of \nbiobank exist, but those that have attracted the most attention are as yet more intent \nthan reality. Especially in the UK, but also beyond, debate has centred around two \nexamples of large-scale biobanking for medical research which are either \u2013 in the case \nof UK Biobank \u2013 still being planned, or \u2013 the Icelandic database \u2013 only partly \nrealised. One difficulty, then, is that we have spoken more about intended projects \u2013 \n_____________ 50\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nand not exploited the experience we do have with biobanking. The second is that \npublic and policy discourse, and to some extent bioethical reflection, has taken its \norientation from now conventional moral categories of medical research ethics. So we \nhave heard a great deal more about principles focussing on individual rights and \nprotections \u2013 informed consent and confidentiality \u2013 than other principles or ethical \nframeworks. This is surely very odd, given the necessarily collective nature of these \nprojects.3\n \nThis suggests two routes toward greater clarity about the legitimating principles for \nhuman biobanking. First, that we ask whether our dominant focus on individual \nrights, so clearly ill-suited to reflecting on large-scale collaborative research, might \nserve other purposes beyond the protection of individual rights. Second, that we give \nattention to the already existing, and in some cases highly successful, examples of \nbiobanking, and how far individual rights provide a framework for ethical reflection \non these. \n \nI begin by examining how it may be that we have come to identify ethics with a focus \non individual rights, above all informed consent, and the different purposes and \ninterests this focus may serve. I then describe some notable examples of large-scale \nbiobanks, and examine how a focus on individual rights hinders us in appreciating the \nethical issues that they raise. I conclude with the contention that, although some \norganised interests may be motivated to separate (bio)ethics from questions of \nundoubted political significance, a concern with ethics must point us in exactly the \nopposite direction. To focus on individual rights may actually undermine individual \nrights and interests, in ways that benefit some organised interests, because important \nsocial, political and scientific questions are left out of consideration.4\n \nIndividual rights and informed consent \n \nThe main planks of medical research ethics after the second world war are well-\nknown, first and foremost in the form of the World Medical Association\u2019s Declaration \nof Helsinki (1962). Against the horrifying abuses of individuals that were perpetrated \nin Nazi Germany and Japan, and against increasing awareness of serious on-going \nabuses within democracies such as the USA or even Sweden, two ideas were made \ncentral to medical research ethics. The first was the free and voluntary consent of the \nindividual research subject. This coincided, of course, with Western societies\u2019 \nincreasing emphasis upon the informed consent of patients to any medical \ninterventions they might undergo. The second measure was ethical review of research \ntrials via \u2018research ethics committees\u2019 or \u2018institutional review boards.\u2019 Of course, it \nwas not only that \u2018experiments\u2019 were done that no-one in their right mind would \nconsent to, but \u2013 and this fact gets forgotten when we focus on informed consent \nalone \u2013 the research (or so-called research) should never have been conceived of in \nthe first place. To these two key planks of research ethics we should also add \nconfidentiality, carried over from conventional medical ethics. \n \n_____________ 51\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nThe individual rights, to confidentiality but above all to informed consent, have come \nto dominate ethical thought about medical research. This may be an unfair \ngeneralisation so far as academic bioethical reflection is concerned, long since \nadvanced beyond its \u2018four principles\u2019 stages. But so far as a generalisation can be fair, \nI suggest this reasonably applies to the teaching of bioethics, to common perceptions \nof (bio)ethics, and to the avowedly \u2018ethical\u2019 components of policy thinking. Simply \nand crudely: when most people, and most organisations, think of ethics they think of \nethical safeguards for individuals. The background assumption is that research is a \ngood, if not a good in itself; and therefore all that ethics need do is ensure that the \nrights of participants are respected: consent and confidentiality. While research ethics \ncommittees continue to scrutinise research proposals from the point of view of \nscientific soundness and not just individual rights, we still find a natural and \nunfortunate division between \u2018good science\u2019 and \u2018good conduct.\u2019 More than this, \nthese standard mechanisms to protect rights and to ensure that research is well-\nconceived do not answer as to which research is pursued, which avenues ignored, and \nhow research is organised. Not all research, after all, is equally desirable. \n \nIt is a difficult question, why we should have come to think that the ethics of medical \nresearch can be decided in terms of safeguards for individual rights, above all \ninformed consent. I would like to suggest that a diverse range of factors has been at \nwork. Some of these undoubtedly reflect good and valid reasons for insisting on the \nimportance of consent to medical research (although my own view is that consent \nshould not be necessary for every sort of research5). But there are other factors at \nwork here, that suggest that our focus on consent is a little too convenient: that it may \nfit too neatly with some common habits of Western thought, that such a focus may in \nfact serve organised interests which can work against the public good and even the \ngood of individual research subjects. We can view informed consent as a powerful \ncase study of how any principle \u2013 however valid it may be \u2013 is always more \ncomplicated and ambivalent in its practice than we might like to think. \n \nThe difficulty of this question \u2013 why we should so often focus on informed consent \u2013 \nis only enhanced when we remember some obvious and well-known difficulties that \nattend it. Allow me to mention only a few.6\n \n\u2022 As study upon study has shown, the \u2018informed\u2019 aspect of informed consent \nproves to be rather fleeting. People persistently ignore, forget, misunderstand \nthe information that researchers provide them with; quite often they forget that \nthey have consented to a research project at all. There is the further question as \nto whether the promises and information that potential research subjects are \ngiven are actually accurate, which points us to the need for institutional \noversight of this, and other, aspects of how any research project is conducted. \nIt seems, indeed, that many research ethics committees have come to see their \nmost substantive \u2018ethical\u2019 task as ensuring the accuracy of informed consent \nforms. \n_____________ 52\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \n\u2022 Informed consent is irrelevant to many groups of (potential) research subjects. \nIt is impossible with infants and problematic with older children. It is also \npretty much useless for the retarded, the senile, the demented and for some \ntypes of mental illness.7 Indeed, as evidence for my claim that informed \nconsent tends to orient our thinking and practice, sometimes harmfully, we \nmight recall the well-known problem of non-research that arises here. The \neffects of many drugs on children are simply not researched or documented, \nvastly increasing the risk when they are thought necessary to treat a child. \nInstead of organised research, then, we have a plethora of unorganised, \nunreported and unsynthesised experiments on people who are incompetent to \nconsent. \n \n\u2022 When we focus upon individual consent to research, we also neglect the \nimportance of statutory research, that poses few risks to individuals but is \nessential to the running and improvement of collective health provision. \nExamples include: audits of medical practitioners, teams and organisations; \nmonitoring for cost-effectiveness; research concerning public health and \nepidemiology; follow-up of medical interventions for side-effects and \nefficacy; monitoring of notifiable diseases; and the keeping of disease \nregisters. These have usually not been subject to informed consent and their \nvalue would be undermined if they were, in terms of not only incompleteness \nbut also probable selectivity in opting out.8 One way such research has been \ndefended from the requirement of informed consent is by the anonymisation of \nsubjects\u2019 samples and\/or information; but this is not always possible or \ndesirable. \n \n\u2022 Informed consent is about individuals, and one of its purposes is to empower \nindividuals against organised and expert researchers. However, it can actually \nobscure this power relationship. Requiring consent will not, by itself, alter the \nfact that uncoordinated individuals are always subject to the power of \norganised groups or institutions. This fact may not be problematic so long as \nwe can reasonably take the benefits and organisation of research for granted. \nBut for many reasons this is not something we should do. One important \nadvance in the organisation of medical research occurred with the advent of \nHIV\/AIDS. As we know, this disease was very badly researched to begin with, \nlargely because of prejudice against the groups who were worst affected. One \nresponse was political organisation among some of those groups, to lobby for \nand even fund the necessary research. As became clear, not all the institutions \ninvolved in medical research are operating in the public interest; indeed, we \nshould be well aware that no organisation can be trusted reliably to serve that \ninterest without active public scrutiny. \n \nAll these well-known difficulties only sharpen the question: why should informed \nconsent have become so definitive of medical and research ethics \u2013 not just in \n(philosophical) bioethics but above all in how ethics is understood by practitioners, \npolicy-makers and their institutions? \n \nIn the philosophical context, consent has a natural fit with certain framing assumption \nof much ethical theory. Key among these is our customary focus on individual duties, \n_____________ 53\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nindividual rights, and respect for the choosing subject via the elusive, multivalent \nnotion of autonomy. This relates to a tendency to focus on the competent, rights-\nbearing adult, wrongly seen as independent rather than interdependent. Furthermore, \nit is connected with a view of ethics that is separated from politics by a focus on \nindividual decision-making \u2013 and exhibits a corresponding tendency to ignore how \ncontexts of choice are formed, especially how institutions structure, enable and \ndisable our choices. That is to say, some framing assumptions of philosophical ethics \nfit rather neatly \u2013 too neatly \u2013 with a focus on consent and other individual rights such \nas confidentiality. To put the point mildly, this makes it more difficult to frame \ndiscussion of issues that arise in collective action and decision-making \u2013 not least, in \nmy context here, how medical research is organised and prioritised. However \u2013 this \npoint is essentially to do with academic theorising, and has less explanatory power \nwhen it comes to practitioners\u2019 and policy discourse, not to mention that of lay \npeople. \n \nSo far as lay people are concerned: None of my contentions here are meant to dispute \nhow important are the protections and guarantees that informed consent provides to \nthe subject of both treatment and research. The openness and choice signalled by \ninformed consent procedures provide some protection for the subject\u2019s basic interests, \nand perhaps some opportunity to choose in the light of h\/er own values. For parents, \nproxy consent provides a means to protect their child(ren) in the face of organisations \nthat are not always trusted. The provision of information makes for openness, which is \nat least a precondition in ensuring fairness as well as protection of interests. \n \nSome have argued that there is more to the story that this, and here we enter more \nambiguous territory. One can see the practical emphasis on informed consent as fitting \nwith a certain sort of self-conception. Investigation of what research subjects say \u2013 \nand of what people who refuse to participate in research also say \u2013 suggests that \ninformed consent supports an image of the \u2018responsible subject.\u20199 That is, it enables \npeople to see themselves as moral and responsible, choosing in the light of a moral \nimperative to participate in research. This is true even of those who refuse to \nparticipate: it is only that they find that possible risks weigh more heavily than the \nduty to assist research. In short, informed consent fits well with our ideas of what it is \nto be a responsible person \u2013 and who does not want to see h\/erself as responsible? \n \nThis suggests that informed consent is serving, not the interests, but rather the self-\nimage of actual and potential research subjects. In itself, this may not sound \nparticularly sinister. Protecting autonomy is protecting the right to choose in the light \nof one\u2019s values; and we have good reason to hope that people will number social \nresponsibility amongst those values. If mechanisms of informed consent encourage \nthis, then this is only a sign that our \u2018autonomy\u2019 is necessarily limited by the \ninstitutions in which we act and think \u2013 and rightly so, insofar as those institutions are \njust. \n_____________ 54\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nThis raises the question, of course, as to how just those institutions and their divisions \nof responsibility may be. Part of seeing oneself as responsible is accepting \nresponsibility; and it may be that subjects of research are finding themselves \naccepting more responsibility than they ought. Many have noticed that informed \nconsent procedures can involve an imposition of responsibility upon the subject, as \nco-decider, co-responsible for the project \u2013 someone who becomes \u2018concerned\u2019 in \nboth senses, participating and anxious. Neo-Foucauldians such as Nikolas Rose have \nanalysed modern Western societies in terms of \u2018responsibilisation.\u2019 Thus Rose claims, \n\u2018individuals are not merely \u201cfree to choose,\u201d but obliged to be free, to understand and \nenact their lives in terms of choice.\u201910 As a simple example, we might notice how \nmany Western governments have preferred to target health interventions at \nindividuals, rather than regulating the activities of commercial organisations. In the \nUK, childhood obesity has become a source of great concern, not to say moral panic. \nThus far the response has been to emphasise parental responsibilities, and not (for \nexample) to regulate the marketing of energy-dense foods by private enterprise. \n \nIn the context of genetics, an emphasis on individual responsibility has often been \nseen as a guarantee against the bad old eugenics. This has been very clear in the case \nof genetic counselling, for instance, in advising couples concerning the possible \ntransmission of genetic disorders to any children they may have. The professional \nethos of genetic counselling has centred on non-directiveness \u2013 a purported refusal to \nimpose medical or state values upon the subject (in direct contrast not only to \neugenics but also to the conventional value-laden-ness of medical care).11 But this \ndistancing of the state \u2013 or rather, of health care practitioners who may be funded by \nthe state \u2013 from individual choice has a potentially invidious aspect. It can be, indeed \nsometimes is, experienced as a handing-over of responsibility to the parents, \nconstituting a refusal to help, to share responsibility for what can be immensely \ndifficult decisions.12\n \nReturning to the context of medical research, this immediately suggests one reason \nwhy many subjects show so little recall of information about the project, and indeed \nmay show very little interest in even \u201creading the form.\u201d What you don\u2019t know about \ncan\u2019t be an object of your responsibility \u2013 or so we commonly tell ourselves. Not \nknowing can operate as a way of refusing a (dimly perceived) imposition of \nresponsibility. \n \nConsent procedures not only impose responsibility, for better or for worse. They can \nand do impose risks and costs on subjects.13 Informed consent procedures usually \nmake clear that research subjects will not share in any profits or gains that stem from \nthe research. Whatever its motivation, this clarification effectively functions as a \nrenunciation of any possible entitlement to a share in profits or benefits. Thus \ninformed consent forms become a contract clarifying future rights \u2013 or lack thereof. \nSometimes consent forms will even disavow the researcher\u2019s liability should certain \nrisks to the subject materialise \u2013 a provision that is certainly against the subject\u2019s \ninterest and unquestionably to the benefit of the researcher\u2019s host institution. In either \ncase, as one writer puts it, \u2018the consent becomes a waiver\u201914 \u2013 with regard to future \nrisks to the subject, and future benefits to the researching institution. \n_____________ 55\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nThese darker aspects of informed consent are increasingly well-recognised, in the \nbioethical literature at least. Another problem is simpler, cruder and larger than all of \nthe above. A focus on informed consent is also highly convenient for researchers and \ntheir institutions, and above all commercial enterprises. The reason is simple: insofar \nas individual rights delimit the domain of ethics, they shield other substantive issues \nfrom critical scrutiny. Not the least of these is the most important factor distorting \npriorities for medical research in the world today: the transnational pharmaceutical \nindustry, operating in a context of gross global injustice and often in the context of \ninadequate or ill-conceived national health care frameworks. Pursuing a pill for every \nlucrative ill, this is an industry more concerned with marketing than research, more \nconcerned with markets than needs, more concerned to market treatments than to \nprevent ill-health. The industry naturally promotes a reductive, individualistic and \nremedial approach to health, one that governments, researchers and health \norganisations have too often fallen in with. In the face of this enormous problem, \ninformed consent, or other individual rights, are no answer at all \u2013 worse, such a focus \nconstitutes an obstacle to perceiving the problem at all. Too often, it seems that to talk \nabout such large and overwhelming factors is to stop talking ethics and to start talking \nsomething less respectable \u2013 that is, politics, something which (it may be implied) \nneither researchers or bioethicists should concern themselves with.  \n \nA second problem is related. If ethics is about consent or confidentiality, then ethics is \nno longer concerned with the scientific validity of research, gauging the likely \nbenefits of research, and establishing priorities among well-grounded research \npossibilities. Evidently research ethics committees play an important role in \naddressing such issues at the micro level. Apart from the signal fact that this still \nleaves the macro level unaddressed, there remains the problem that \u2018science\u2019 and \n\u2018ethics\u2019 can too easily come apart. If such committees see their ethical task as \nprotecting individual rights, and their scientific task as scrutinising the validity and \nworkability of proposals, then at least two results ensue. The fact that scientific \nvalidity is a moral demand tends to drop from sight: yet validity matters so much \nbecause we want effective health interventions. Second, the extent to which a research \nproposal is worthwhile comes back to the narrower question of whether it should be \nable to properly investigate its leading hypothesis. The narrowing of ethics to \nindividual rights can thus operate to support technocracy,15 distancing assessment and \ndecision-making from the perspectives and concerns of non-experts, and leaving \n\u2018ethics\u2019 unable to challenge commercialism or other distorting factors in priority-\nsetting for medical research. The questions of whose health and whose interests will \nbe served by research are too rarely asked, and need not be answered. \n \nIn short, while there are certainly good reasons for valuing informed consent, there are \nalso several bad reasons why we may be led to over-emphasise it \u2013 reasons that have \nnothing to do with protecting research subjects and which divert our attention from \nthe plain collective duty to choose our research priorities wisely. \n \n_____________ 56\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nBiobanking as a case study \n \nI turn now to the case of large-scale biobanking. Biobanking involves the storage of \n(i) tissue samples and\/or genetic information and (ii) personal information, such as \nhealth care data (disease histories, treatments received), lifestyle information \n(nutrition, exercise, wealth, family background) and sometimes genealogy, or certain \nother sorts of identifying data. \n \nBiobanking is not a new phenomenon, but it has taken on a much greater significance \nwith the emergence of research into genetics and the first practical applications of \ngenetic knowledge. In fact, two of the most important applications of genetic \nknowledge have not been medical at all. As we know, we are still a very long way \nfrom decoding all but the most simple health information from a person\u2019s genetic \nmake-up (that is, chromosomal abnormalities and single gene disorders). What we can \ndo is to use genetic samples to identify individuals and to identify basic genealogical \nlinkages. At present, then, the most significant uses of genetic information are \nforensic investigation and paternity (or maternity) testing. Biobanking can then take \ntwo main forms: either to exploit these existing abilities, or as a basis for research to \nincrease our understanding of the human genome and how its tiny variations between \nindividuals might affect our bodily make-up and our health. \n \nExploiting existing abilities, and correspondingly the most well-established of \nbiobanks, are forensic biobanks. The UK\u2019s National DNA Database is the largest in \nthe world, with genetic profiles from just over three million people16 \u2013 it has doubled \nin size since 2002 and we are told to expect a similar rate of increase for the \nforeseeable future. When DNA samples can be extracted from traces left at crime \nscenes, they can be processed and the resulting \u2018profile\u2019 compared with the millions \non record. Sometimes a match will occur, which can be invaluable in linking different \ncrimes or in identifying a culprit. Sometimes too a sample can be taken from a suspect \nand shown not to match DNA that can be reliably identified with the crime: so \nsuspects can be shown to be innocent, not just guilty. The UK also has a large \ndatabase for paternity testing, so that financial responsibilities for childcare can be \nallocated to the biological father, where partnerships have broken up. This is much \nsmaller, and I will leave it aside here. \n \nOf course, these sorts of biobank can also be used for various forms of research, \nhowever unclear the ethics of this might be. The greatest interest here has naturally \nbeen in deriving phenotypic information from a genetic sample, so as to aid \nidentification of the person who has left traces at a crime scene \u2013 thus information \nabout quantitative traits such as height; hair, skin and eye colour; or even facial \ncharacteristics. This research is still in its infancy, and other possible discoveries such \nas correlations between genetic make-up and behavioural traits (the \u2018criminal gene\u2019?) \nare, for the moment, no more than science-fiction. \n \n_____________ 57\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nThe other forms of biobanking are principally concerned to increase our knowledge of \nhow genetic variation influences body and health. One older form of biobanking, \nwhich I will not be concerned with here, is simply the storage of human tissues from \npeople suffering from particular disorders. This has been going on for a long time, \nbecause there are many properties of tissues that are more immediately and obviously \nrelevant to health than DNA. These banks tend to be relatively small, spread out \nacross the health service and private companies, and are often not documented, many \nbeing built up by individual researchers in the course of their careers. These disease-\nspecific banks, apart from not being principally concerned with genetic research, are \nalso close to conventional medical research in that it is samples and data from the \nunwell that are used. Often the data will be gathered post-mortem, which also means \nit can effectively be anonymised and does not raise so many issues of individual \nrights. (However, it can raise profound concerns about parental rights, as we saw in \nthe UK\u2019s Alder Hey scandal, when organs from dead children were taken for research \nwithout parents\u2019 understanding.) \n \nNeither the involvement of the unwell, nor even the deceased, apply to the two forms \nof biobanking which I would like to consider alongside the forensic case. In these \ncases, samples and information are taken from many people, most of whom are not \nsuffering any particular disease or disorder. The information, and perhaps samples \ntoo, are taken on an on-going basis. \n \nThe examples that have attracted the most attention, perhaps because of their sheer \nscale and novelty, are the large-scale biobanks for adult medical research. The most \nwell-known, and the furthest along the path to being realised, is the Icelandic genetic \ndatabase. This is a complicated arrangement, which was originally supposed to be \nmade up of three different databases, and has several distinctive features: \n \n\u2022 Samples and genetic information, and genealogical information are being \nentered onto two separate but linked databases. Originally a further database \nof health care data was conceived, the Health Sector Database, but it now \nappears unlikely that this will be created. \n \n\u2022 The whole population is included in the genealogical database (around \n290,000 people in 2004); consent is not involved as this uses existing public \ndata. The database of genetic samples is gathered on the basis of informed \nconsent. The Health Sector Database was enormously controversial because it \npresumed consent \u2013 that is, health data was to be gathered automatically, \nexcept from those who specifically opted out.17 \n \n\u2022 The resulting database is under exclusive licence to a commercial enterprise, \ndeCode genetics. \n \nThese last two aspects have made the Icelandic database especially controversial, in \nthat informed consent was to have been waived for health data collection, and that the \nresearch agenda is being shaped by a private company \u2013 which is, of course, hoping to \nprofit from any findings. \n_____________ 58\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nAlmost as well-known is UK Biobank, a major initiative currently in its pilot stages.18 \nThis is supported by the UK government, the Medical Research Council, and the \nWellcome Trust (the world\u2019s largest medical research charity) at a projected cost of \n\u00a360 million (and many suggest this will represent only the initial costs). It will gather \nsamples and data from half-a-million people, aged 40-69 \u2013 most of whom will be \nhealthy but many of whom will develop some of the major diseases of Western \nsocieties \u2013 heart disease, cancer and so on \u2013 in the next decades. Consent will be \nasked, and there will be no exclusive licence to a commercial enterprise, though \nprivate companies will have access to the biobank, on terms yet to be established.  \n \nFinally, I want to mention a third type of research biobank, smaller and better \nestablished than the large-scale adult databases just mentioned. Various child-cohort \nstudies exist around the world. The UK has two important examples. In Bristol, there \nis the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC, otherwise known \nas the \u2018Children of the 90s\u2019 study. This includes information about 14,000 children \nborn in the early nineties, as well as their mothers and fathers. Biological samples, \nmedical information and lifestyle information are gathered on a regular basis from all \nthe children. By stark contrast with UK Biobank, this project has been funded on a \nshoe-string, by small, discontinuous grants from the various UK funding bodies. \nThere is also the North Cumbria Community Genetics Project, which is more \nnarrowly directed toward genetic studies, with samples from about 5,000 children and \ntheir mothers. \n \nThe scale of the Iceland database and UK Biobank can only partly explain the \nattention they have received. After all, the UK\u2019s National DNA Database is far larger \nthan both combined, and much longer established; this is true of forensic biobanks in \nother countries too.19 The child cohort studies are also much better established, \nhaving been up and working for over a decade. I would like to suggest that the greater \nattention devoted to these new, largely speculative projects has arisen not only \nbecause of their scale but because they are more congenial to our framing assumptions \nabout ethics. Although the large adult biobanks unquestionably pose difficulties for \nour established ethical framework for medical research, they are by no means as \nproblematic as the forensic and child cohort cases, because informed consent remains \nan important and relevant issue.20 (So too confidentiality, but this is a concern for all \nmy examples.) Nonetheless, consent serves us badly as a point of orientation for the \nadult medical banks, as well as being nigh-on useless in the child and forensic cases. \nThe larger, better-established forensic databases can help us meet this difficulty, \nbecause in these cases it is self-evident that not consent but public policy principles \n(such as institutional oversight) and competing political priorities (eg, crime detection, \nlimiting state surveillance) must provide the framework for our thinking. Here we can \nno longer maintain artificial divides between the ethical and the political, between \nindividual rights and public goods \n \nWhy are individual rights, to consent or confidentiality, inadequate to the new large-\nscale research biobanks, like Iceland\u2019s or UK Biobank? I suggest the answer is \nrelatively straightforward. They transcend our usual examples of medical research in \nthree important respects: (1) These projects are prospective and open-ended by their \nvery nature, and necessarily are very broad and indeterminate in their research \npurposes; (2) Most of the research subjects will not be ill; in many respects, moreover, \n_____________ 59\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nit would be better to begin with children rather than adults; (3) Their sheer scale \nmeans that they evade our standard mechanism for ensuring that individuals \nparticipate in well-designed research, the research ethics committee. I will comment \non the first and second points in turn; the question of how well-conceived the research \nbiobanks arises as an important issue for both. \n \nWith regard to the prospective nature of the studies: The biobanks require an on-going \ncontribution from the research subject. If not samples, then at least health information \nand possibly lifestyle data should be entered into the bank over an indefinite period of \ntime \u2013 ideally, until death, or, rather, post-mortem. This has, in turn, two important \nimplications. First, complete anonymisation of data is impossible, as this would \nprevent new data being linked to the old, and to the tissue sample or genetic \ninformation. The best we can do is to code data, and entrust linkages to a secure \nbureau or trustee. (As the forensic databases remind us, genetic information is in \nprinciple never securely anonymous.) This means that there are always risks to \nsubjects in terms of breaches of confidentiality, and there are many interested parties \nsuch as insurance companies, employers and even state agencies who might use such \ninformation against subjects\u2019 interests. Of course, these risks are likely to increase \nover time, to the extent that we become better able to interpret individual genetic \nvariations. \n \nSecond, and more important from the point of view of consent: it is necessarily \nimpossible to inform research subjects about the nature of the research that will be \nconducted with the biobank. As our knowledge increases, we can hope to investigate \nmuch more with the information banked, but what that \u2018much more\u2019 will be no one \ncan say. However \u2013 and this point is by no means incidental \u2013 this is not just a \nproblem of inevitable ignorance on the part of scientists and subjects. (After all, there \nwill always be ignorance about the future outcome of any meaningful research study.) \nIt also relates to an on-going problem of overstatement regarding the projected uses \nand findings of the biobanks. We are being promised all sorts of knowledge and \nbenefits, yet these promises are often vaguely articulated and, on examination, frankly \nimplausible. \n \nThis implausibility begins with the major practical issue for any study of such a scale: \nhow to obtain and process sufficiently detailed and accurate information concerning \nthe lives, health and changes in physical condition of the research subjects. Though \nsome lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, are fairly easy to record, \nothers, such as diet, alcohol intake and physical activity are more complex and \nproblematic (self-reporting is notoriously unreliable), so too psychosocial variables. \nSimilarly, medical information is extremely difficult to gather and codify except in \ncategories that will often be too wide for meaningful comparison. Measurements of \nsimple physical variables such as blood pressure need to be repeated if research \nsubjects are to be compared informatively, while repeated measurements of more \ncomplex variables \u2013 anything from glucose levels to cholesterol to blood cell counts \u2013 \nwill be extremely costly on such a scale. Thus greater understanding of the \nconnections between genetic variations and disease susceptibility is only likely to \narrive in the most crude and unhelpful forms. Smokers with these genetics variants \nand a diet including meat (Which meats? Eaten how often? And with what?) have \u2013 \non average \u2013 an x% higher risk of heart disease.  \n_____________ 60\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \n \nAt least some of these issues can be overcome with sufficient resources. Behind them, \nhowever, stands the well-known yet neglected fact that the diseases most often \nmentioned in connection with the medical biobanks are diseases of Western societies \n\u2013 that is, diseases whose causation can only have a slight basis in genetic variations, \nand are overwhelmingly related to socio-economic, environmental and lifestyle \nfactors.21\n \nThese obvious scientific difficulties have not discouraged highly speculative \nsuggestions about the findings and technologies that might result from biobank \nresearch. Two in particular recur in the literature. We are promised \npharmacogenomics \u2013 drugs \u2018tailored to each individual\u2019s genetic constitution\u2019 \u2013 and \npopulation genetic screening \u2013 the possibility of screening for susceptibility to various \ndiseases, with the promise that preventative measures can then be tailored to \nindividuals. Both seem unlikely to materialise and unlikely to generate significant \nbenefits if they do. Consider population screening: we may find out that some \nindividuals have a higher risk of some sort of heart disease should they fail to exercise \nregularly as compared to others. The obvious preventative measure is regular exercise \n\u2013 something which we should all undertake anyhow. More speculative measures \ninclude drugs that will have a prophylactic effect \u2013 \u2018pills for the healthy ill,\u2019 as they \nhave been ironically christened \u2013 with the attendant costs of testing and the risks of \nany pharmaceutical intervention. None of this looks likely to represent good value for \nmoney from a public health perspective.22\n \nSo far as pharmacogenomics is concerned: there may be some basis for expecting \nsome useful tests for some particular (classes of) drug, but the overall benefits are \nlikely to be relatively slight. So far as the cost-benefit ratio of any test that does \nemerge is concerned, the issues here are twofold. First, most adverse drug reactions \narise from dosage problems, interactions with other drugs or environmental factors, or \nphysiological problems such as impaired liver or kidney function. Second, many \nproblems of intolerance or non-response to drugs will therefore not be predicted by \ngenetic tests, which in any case are likely to yield only probabilistic information, so \nthat the need for careful monitoring of a patient\u2019s drug response will not be \ndiminished. Both of these difficulties would apply even if it proved relatively \nstraightforward to identify pertinent genetic variations and turn them into a cheap, \nreliable test.23\n \nClearly much more might be said with regard to these difficulties, but the broad \nproblems with both sets of promises are easy to see. I mention them here for two \nreasons. First, as regards the \u2018informed\u2019 part of consent, they suggest that subjects are \nliable to be misled about the broad terms of the biobanks they join.24 Second, they \npoint us to issues that go much beyond those individuals \u2013 above all, to the question \nof whether these projects are scientifically well-justified and reasonable value for \nmoney, as against the many other ways we might invest in health and health research. \nIt is interesting, moreover, that the biobanks\u2019 ambitions are notably congenial to \npharmaceutical companies (in terms of markets for genetic tests and prophylactic and \nremedial drugs), despite the fact that most large-scale medical biobanks are heavily \nreliant on public funding. It seems that a reductive, individualistic and medicalised \napproach to health is dominating our thinking about genetic research \u2013 despite the fact \n_____________ 61\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nthat this research is essentially collective in nature, despite the fact that genetics might \njust as well remind us how much human beings have in common and how greatly \nvariations between people must be attributed to non-genetic factors. \n \nTo turn, now, to a second important respect in which large-scale medical biobanking \ndiffers from conventional medical research: Most of the participants will not be \nsuffering any particular illness. This is advantageous from the point of view of \nconsent, both so far as adult subjects and parents of child subjects are concerned: not \nexperiencing the strain of illness and not needing to be grateful for present health care, \npeople are more able to attend to the research proposal and less likely to feel \npressured into participating. The disadvantage of this, however, is that research \nsubjects are much less likely to take an active interest in the research being done \u2013 \nthat is, to feel responsible for ensuring research is done that reflects their interests. \nOver the past two decades, we have increasingly seen patient groups forming (albeit \nsometimes with the connivance of pharmaceutical companies), who have lobbied for \nresearch into their conditions: I have already mentioned the crucial role of patient \nactivism, and more broadly gay activism, in HIV\/AIDS research. We surely cannot \nexpect participants in UK Biobank to take to the streets to ensure that this resource is \nused for the public interest; at most, there may be a tendency for subjects to withdraw \ntheir participation if it becomes clear that a biobank is not being used for ends they \ncan endorse.25\n \nIn addition to being mostly well, there is a case for thinking children would make \nmore suitable subjects, so long as we want to give due weight to environmental \nfactors. In particular, if we want to know about the explosion of allergies, asthma and \nfood intolerances, or about conditions that promise premature death such as diabetes \nand obesity, then we need to know an awful lot about the details of childhood \ndevelopment, including development during pregnancy.26 As with the common causes \nof mortality mentioned in connection with the adult biobanks, these are obviously not \ndisorders with a substantial genetic basis. Furthermore, the findings of such studies \nare unlikely to point to pharmaceutical interventions. Most probably such \ninterventions will consist in broad public health measures, likely to be lower in risk, \ncheaper per person and more beneficial to everyone \u2013 apart, one is tempted to add, \nfrom those with an interest in selling more medical drugs or tests. \n \nIt is quite clear that informed consent is barely relevant to justifying child-cohort \nstudies, and it is at least arguable that our preoccupation with consent has undermined \nthem \u2013 making child research appear much more problematic than need be. (I have \nalready mentioned how badly funded such projects have tended to be; the disparity in \nfunding between these and UK Biobank is especially notable.) If such projects are to \nbe justified, consent must of course play a role \u2013 to start with, parental consent, and \nlater and increasingly, the children\u2019s consent. Here consent is operating not so much \nto protect children\u2019s interests, which must be an important duty on the part of those \ndesigning and managing the study, but rather to ensure trust and to promote fuller \nparticipation. (The sort of detailed information required about subjects cannot, after \nall, be discovered without the willing involvement of parent as well as child.) But \nbeyond consent, and still more important, is scrutiny of the research undertaken using \nthe data \u2013 whether it is well-conceived and likely to yield meaningful knowledge and \nbenefits. The crucial question must be the soundness of the project in toto \u2013 whether it \n_____________ 62\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nreally brings together data of the detail and quality needed to investigate lifestyle-\nenvironment-health interactions (with the possibility of investigating genetic factors \nwhere this seems likely to be fruitful), whether it is really likely to yield cost-effective \nmeasures to improve health. \n \nIt is useful, too, to remember the forensic databases, where genetic knowledge is \nbeing exploited for non-health purposes. Here, no one talks about consent, which \nwould render the collections barely useful; samples are usually taken on a statutory \nbasis. What has been important in justifying such databases is not individual rights but \nthe public interest in detecting the culprits of violent crimes. Especially the \nassociation of DNA samples with sexual offences has made this justification \noverwhelmingly persuasive to the public. This does not mean that many critical points \nshould not be made about forensic databases.27 Here we lack not only the limited \nprotections afforded by consent procedures but also the other well-developed checks \nof medical and research ethics \u2013 above all concerning confidentiality, scrutiny of \nresearch proposals and institutional oversight. These databases represent a huge \ngrowth in potential state power. Costs (as benefits) to individuals can be very severe, \nand abuses or infringements of individual rights are easy to imagine. Here, again, one \nmay fear that a seductive \u2018genetic fix\u2019 is at work: some worry that genetics is \ndiverting attention from careful forensic work; in any case, such a database is hardly \npreventative of crime and its overwhelmingly social causes (although we might hope \nthat the databases will develop some deterrent effects).  \n \nNonetheless, there is widespread recognition that we should think about forensic \ndatabases in political terms such as the public interest, the extent of state power, and \nchecks and balances such as (presently lacking) institutional oversight mechanisms to \nregulate access and usage. Much less is said about the forensic banks: this is partly \nbecause it is much more difficult to investigate their workings, and partly because \nthey fall less than squarely within the conventional domain of bioethics. But I have \nalso pointed to a less welcome explanation: might this neglect not also reflect the \nindubitable fact that they raise significant political questions \u2013 questions which \nexpose the narrowness of \u2018ethics\u2019 as it is commonly understood? So long as we do pay \nattention to the forensic banks, however, we will have no doubt that large-scale \nbiobanking raises important policy and political issues, issues which cannot be dealt \nwith by focussing on individual rights. Not the least of these \u2013 as in the forensic case, \nas in the justification of studies on children who cannot meaningfully consent \u2013 will \nbe whether the banks represent a worthwhile priority, liable to generate knowledge \nand benefits on a scale commensurate with the investment they demand. \n_____________ 63\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \nConclusion \n \nMost bioethical writing on biobanking recognises some of the limitations of a \nframework based on individual rights, and there have been repeated calls for other \nprinciples to frame the issues. Some candidates that have been offered include \nsolidarity, altruism (the \u2018gift relationship\u2019), benefit-sharing and \u2018governance.\u2019 These \nconcepts have made some impact on public and policy discourse, but have often been \ntaken up in a frankly instrumental way \u2013 \u2018gift\u2019 being a well-documented example, \nwhereby subjects get moral credit and nothing else in return for their participation.28\n \nThe first part of my discussion argued that informed consent is an ideal whose \npractice has turned out to be more complicated and ambivalent than one would wish. \nThis is no more than one might expect when an ideal is pulled into practice: situated \namid competing interests and diverse institutional imperatives, deployed in contexts \nwhich were quite unthought of when it was originally coined. We might suspect that \nother general principles are liable to meet similar fates: a duty to participate in \ncollective research, a notion of altruistic donation, the imperative for just sharing of \nbenefits, and the importance of institutional regulatory mechanisms \u2013 these are all \nideas with clear validity, but their limits are not difficult to see. Moreover, none of \nthem really highlight the central questions that biobanks pose: How well-conceived is \nthis line of research? What will its benefits be? Why this research and not something \nelse? How are we organising and funding research? Nor do they help us uncover the \npresuppositions we may be making about the nature of health and ill-health: I have \nonly alluded to a few of the problems involved in conceiving of health in individual, \ngenetic, and medicalised terms. No one can believe that this is anything like the whole \nstory about health, but as an unexamined assumption it is surely a powerful factor in \nkeeping (bio)ethics away from political and economic factors. \n \nBe that as it may, the more immediate motivation for my argument here has been the \nfear that the new large-scale medical biobanks will prove wrong-headed ventures, \nwhich will generate relatively little basic knowledge and few useful applications. \nCertainly, they seem unlikely to take us much closer to key sources of chronic ill-\nhealth, nor to generate population-wide measures that tackle common causes of \npremature death. We may end up thinking of UK Biobank as the Millennium Dome of \nBritish medical research, a glamorous white elephant, expensive but of little use. \nHowever much UK Biobank may not infringe individual rights, it has been too large \nto be caught by less commonly mentioned research safeguards such as scientific peer \nreview. This assessment may be overly pessimistic. But I think my central argument \nwill still stand: that \u2018ethics\u2019 must engage important questions about what is being \nresearched and why, about our priorities for publicly funded research, about how \nresearch is organised and funded. Informed consent is much too close up for us, or \nresearch subjects, to see this question: its limitations should remind us of the huge \npower differentials between individual research subject and researching organisations. \nLikewise, the net of research ethics committees and scientific peer review is also too \nclose to catch such issues, which concern the aggregate picture. Yet the worse reasons \nfor the enduring popularity of informed consent may remind us that there are powerful \nfactors at work in keeping \u2018ethics\u2019 away from these questions. \n_____________ 64\n \nGenomics, Society and Policy, Vol.1 No.2 (2005) ISSN: 1746-5354 \n\u00a9 CESAGen, Lancaster University, UK. www.gspjournal.com  \n            Genomics, Society and Policy \n            2005, Vol.1, No.2, pp.50\u201366. \n_____________ 65\n                                                                                                                                            \n* A version of this paper was originally presented as part of a British Council Sino-UK Bioethics \nWorkshop \u201cEthics and Life Sciences\u201d in Beijing, 19-20 October 2004, and at related lectures in \nChongqing.

However, European statements on biobanking also \ntend to focus very narrowly on individual rights. See: Nationaler Ethikrat [German National Ethics \nAdvisory Board]. 2004.

An \ninteresting issue, just coming into sight, is the question of what information should be provided to \nsubjects about the progress and interim findings of their studies. \n7  Different problems arise with regard to the position of criminals and soldiers, who (are judged to) \nhave forfeited certain rights. While there has been widespread recognition that trials should not be \nconducted on prisoners, the position of soldiers has remained deeply problematic. \n8  This is not to deny that statistical methods will sometimes be able to compensate for incomplete \nsamples or bias in selection, depending on the investigators\u2019 purpose, situation and possession of \nrelevant background knowledge. \n9  See: E.

In Corrigan and Tutton, op cit (n. 9): 172. \nParticularly notable in our context is the regulatory framework for UK Biobank, where the Ethics and \nGovernance Council and Science Committee form two quite separate entities, with different forms of \n\u2018expertise\u2019 being deemed appropriate to each. \n16  NDNAD\u2019s Fact Sheet of March 2005 claims \u2018NDNAD now holds around 2.9 million DNA profiles \nfrom individuals and 237,500 profiles from crime scenes\u2019 (at www.forensic.gov.uk). \n17  As an aside, it may be worth noting that this opt-out provision would undermine the statutory health \ncare research that the health sector database would also have been used for. An opt-out rate of around \n10% was expected, one that would probably be much greater in specific sub-groups such as the \nmentally ill. Thus research on the functioning of the health service as a whole would be compromised \nby introducing this malnourished cousin of informed consent. \n18  See www.ukbiobank.ac.uk.

Yet the sheer statistical difficulty of tracking multiple \ngene associations should caution us against this claim. \n22  See P. Vineis, P. Schulte and A. McMichael.

Both at www.genewatch.org. \n24  UK Biobank\u2019s website promises that the project will \u2018improve our understanding of the biology of \ndisease and develop improved diagnostic tools, prevention strategies and tailor made treatments for \ndisorders that appear in later life\u2019 (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). \n25  There may be some basis for optimism here. Some have suggested that the prospective and \ncollective nature of biobanks might allow us to think of them, not like conventional research projects \nwhere control must reside with the researcher, but rather on the model of \u2018subscription clubs,\u2019 where \nsubjects retain an on-going stake in the project. It is difficult to see how this might work in practice \n(and there is little sign that UK Biobank is thinking in these terms) but we can certainly conceive of \nmechanisms that would permit subjects to be not just informed about, but involved or represented in, \nestablishing the uses made of the biobank. \n26  Likewise, if we want to understand the glaring relation between health and socio-economic class \u2013 \npatently far more important to variations in health than genetic make-up \u2013 then we need to be tracking \nhealth and physical development against environment, nutrition, familial background, and so on. \n27  See: GeneWatch. 2005.
