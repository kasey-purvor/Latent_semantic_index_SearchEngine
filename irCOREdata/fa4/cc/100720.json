INTRODUCTION\nMANY different applications, ranging from dense wave-length-division-multiplexed (WDM) optical communi-\ncations [1] to photonic THz synthesis [2]\u2013[4], require a reliable\nand cost-effective frequency reference source. The most reliable\nsources as frequency reference are atomic or molecular reso-\nnances [5], [6]. They also offer a large number of frequency lines\nin a relatively dense grid [7], [8], However, they are not suitable\nfor integrated systems. Several other solutions have been pro-\nposed to provide a regularly spaced frequency comb, such as\nManuscript received December 22, 2006; revised April 24, 2007.

The fre-\nquency accuracy and stability of these devices compared with\nthe atomic or molecular resonances are limited by the optical\nlength of the resonators and their mechanical stability (sensi-\ntivity to vibration and thermal changes), though they could be\nstabilized by locking them on an atomic or molecular transi-\ntion. Another solution is the use of deep angle modulation of\nan optical source to generate precisely spaced frequency lines\n[11], [12]. Such systems can be reasonably compact and provide\nlines over a 4-THz ( 50-dB bandwidth) span [12]. However, the\npower of each line is small (from 10 W\/line at the seed laser\npeak down to 1 nW\/line 3 THz from the peak) and the number\nof frequency lines and their spacing are limited by the difficulty\nof realizing such modulation at high frequency. Ultra wide fre-\nquency comb generators (30 THz) have also been demonstrated\nby further increasing the comb width using self-phase modula-\ntion in an optical fiber [13]. Other solutions such as an ampli-\nfied fiber loop comb generator [14], [15] or mode-locked semi-\nconductor lasers [16]\u2013[18] can offer hundreds of lines with a\nspacing from 10 to 25 GHz over a band of at least 1 THz with\na stability limited by the thermal stability of the semiconductor\nlaser (master laser in the case of the fiber loop).\nThe principle of the FM laser [19] is an extension of the FM\nmode-locked laser solution and should offer a large number\nof equally spaced frequency lines, spaced by the modulation\nsource frequency, over the gain spectrum of the semiconductor\nlaser, but without the strong intensity-modulated envelope and\nthe critical frequency tuning of a mode-locked laser which is\ndetrimental to some filtering schemes. In this paper, we describe\nsuch a monolithic InP\u2013InGaAsP FM laser optical comb gener-\nator using the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) [20] as the\nrefractive index modulation mechanism. The laser described in\nthis paper provides a few comb lines spaced by 24.4 GHz over a\nnoncontinuous 15-nm wavelength (2 THz) span. It shows stable\nperformance and an almost constant output power of up to 2 mW\n(an average of 20 W\/line, as the number of lines is limited).\nFurthermore, the phase noise generated when heterodyning two\nsuccessive lines was limited by the phase noise of the modu-\nlation source used, and the linewidth of each line created was\nequal to the free-running laser linewidth. The different issues\nrelated to the fabrication of this laser and some of the operation\nlimitations will also be discussed.\nII. PRINCIPLE OF THE FM SOURCE\nFM laser operation occurs when the laser cavity phase is mod-\nulated at a frequency close to the axial frequency [19].

Theoretical spectrum of an FM laser.\nFM laser operation, there is frequency modulation and no in-\ntensity modulation, and the spectrum will comprise a number\nof lines spaced by the modulation frequency depending on the\nfrequency detuning from the axial mode and the amplitude of\nthe modulation. When the modulation frequency is equal to\nthe axial frequency, the laser will transfer to a mode-locked\npulse regime [21]. The FM laser regime is generated by the\nphase modulation which induces coupling between the different\nmodes of the cavity. The resulting spectrum can be described by\nthe following equations:\n(1)\n(2)\nIn these equations, is the amplitude of the optical field,\nis the laser operating frequency, is the modulation fre-\nquency, is the axial mode spacing of the Fabry\u2013Perot cavity,\nis the amplitude of the phase modulation, and is an or-\ndinary Bessel function. Note that these equations represent an\nideal laser with a flat gain spectrum and pure single-mode oper-\nation (the fundamental mode is described as a Dirac function).\nThis perfect theoretical laser will generate a spectrum as shown\nin Fig. 1. To represent a more realistic laser, one can intro-\nduce a Lorentzian function to describe the laser operating-mode\nlinewidth and simulate what will happen if this laser has several\nmodes operating at the same time (free running) by summing\nthe FM spectra of each mode. Considering the approximations\nmentioned above, (1) can be rewritten as\n(3)\nwhere is a Lorentzian function where the mode linewidth\nis , and we have a total number of modes operating in the\nlaser cavity. Note that (2) remains the same. Fig. 2 shows a se-\nlection of lines created by the FM modulation when three modes\nare operating in the cavity. As expected, the lines are broader, as\nthey are a superimposition of the different FM created lines from\neach of the free-running modes. Furthermore, as the spacing of\nFig. 2. Theoretical comb spectrum generated by a multimode laser.\nthe FM comb and the spacing of the free-running laser modes\nare slightly different, the linewidth of each resulting comb line\nwill depend on its distance from the free-running laser modes.\nTherefore, for optimum operation, the FM laser should exhibit\nsingle-mode operation in the free-running mode (i.e., when not\nmodulated).\nIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE LASER\nFig. 3(a) shows a schematic of the three-section laser. The\nlaser was 1.85 mm long ( 25 GHz axial mode spacing) with\n170- m\u2013long modulation and phase sections. The phase sec-\ntion was used to change the axial mode spacing and thus the\nfrequency detuning while the modulation frequency could\nremain constant. Fig. 3(b) shows the epitaxial structure of\nthe material used for the laser. The structure was grown by\nmetal\u2013organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on a semi-in-\nsulating InP substrate. The active region consists of eight\n7-nm-wide compressively strained (1%) InGaAsP Q1.65 wells,\nalternating with seven 14-nm-wide tensile strained (0.5%)\nInGaAsP Q1.3 barriers, sandwiched between two 10-nm-thick\nInGaAsP Q1.3 waveguide layers. On top of the InGaAs contact\nlayer, a 0.5- m InP buffer layer and a final 0.1- m InGaAs\nbuffer layer were grown. They were used to protect the contact\ncap from damage as shallow ion implantation was used to\ngenerate quantum-well intermixing (QWI) as in [22]. For this\nwork, we implanted P ions at 100-keV energy and\n200 C. With this implantation, energy damage was restricted\nto the buffer layer, thus, when it was subsequently removed,\nthe surface quality of the contact cap was intact. The wafer\nwas masked with 600 nm of PECVD SiO during implantation\nin order to protect the gain sections. After implantation, the\nwafer was rapidly thermally processed at 650 C for 90 s,\nwhich created a 35-nm blue-shift of the bandgap in the phase\nand modulator sections. Part of the wafer was then processed\ninto PIN devices, and photocurrent spectra were measured to\nextract the spectral dependence of the material absorption as a\nfunction of reverse bias, as shown in Fig. 4. This measurement\nwas used to calculate the effect of QCSE on refractive index\nby using the Kramers\u2013Kronig relation (Fig. 5). This showed\nthat the refractive index for the wells changes by 0.17 with 2-V\nreverse bias at a wavelength of 1560 nm (Fig. 5). Such an index\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 06:48 from IEEE Xplore.

Refractive index change due to electric field derived from the data of\nFig. 4. The changes quoted are with reference to the zero-field case.\nchange in the 170- m-long modulation section corresponds to\na phase change sufficient to create the desired FM laser effect at\nrad (4)\nwhere is the refractive index change of the MQW,\nis the confinement factor of the guided optical mode within the\nwells, is the length of the modulation section, and is the\noperating wavelength.\nThe fabricated laser was a ridge waveguide design with oxide-\nbridged contacts in order to reduce the capacitance of the mod-\nulation section (shown in Fig. 3). The different sections were\nseparated by an isolation trench through the highly doped top\nlayers. The oxide-bridged contact for the modulation section al-\nlowed a 380-fF measured capacitance and a 20- series resis-\ntance resulting in a maximum 3-dB modulation bandwidth of\n21 GHz. As both phase section and modulation section were in-\ntermixed, the laser threshold remained relatively low at 80 mA\nfor a 1.88-mm-long device. The laser was operated at 200-mA\nbias current, giving a total output of 2 mW (1 mW coupled into\na single-mode fiber).\nThe isolation trenches induce a small reflection ( 4%) of the\npropagating mode creating subcavity effects. If one considers a\ntrench through the top 1.6 m of the structure and a two-section\ndevice, a simulation of the coupled Fabry\u2013Perot cavities created\nwill lead to the calculated transmission function shown in Fig. 6.\nAs one can see, the transmissions spectrum shows regular dips\n(spaced by 2.1 nm corresponding to a 170- m subcavity) which\nwill strongly affect the output spectrum of the laser. It will offer\nthe advantage of limiting the number of modes operating in the\ncavity, thus the laser could potentially have single-mode free-\nrunning operation. However, it will also limit the number of\ncomb lines generated as they will be confined to the spectral\nzones of higher transmission.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nNote that, for all experimental measurements, the laser output\nwas collected using a lensed fiber with antireflection coating\nwhich was spliced to an optical isolator in order to eliminate\nthe unwanted effects on laser operation due to external optical\nfeedback.\nA. Free-Running Laser\nIn order to optimize the comb generator operation prior to\napplying modulation, the laser gain current was adjusted to give\noptimum free-running operation, where the linewidth is at its\nminimum and the laser operates in a single-mode regime. In\norder to measure the linewidth of the laser mode, a self-hetero-\ndyne system was used [23]. The delay was 5 km, offering a mea-\nsurement resolution of 40 kHz, which should be sufficient as a\ntypical semiconductor laser will have a linewidth of the order\nof a few megahertz. The linewidth was measured as a function\nof the gain section current, as shown in Fig. 7. At low bias cur-\nrent, the laser shows the expected linewidth decrease with in-\ncreased current. However, at a certain bias current (174 mA),\nthe linewidth increases sharply to 200 MHz. This was found to\nbe the bias current where the laser starts to operate in a multi-\nmode regime. The operation point was therefore chosen to be\nFig. 8. Experimental system.\njust below this current. At this bias, the laser had an output\npower of 1.2 mW (0.6 mW coupled into a single-mode fiber,\nwith an operating temperature of 20 C) with a linewidth of\n25 MHz. Note that the measured width on the RF spectrum an-\nalyzer is twice the actual linewidth of the laser [23].\nB. Modulated Laser\nFig. 8 shows the different systems used to characterize the FM\nlaser. The output spectrum of the laser was assessed with an op-\ntical spectrum analyzer. Finer spectral studies were also done\nwith the same self-heterodyne system used previously on the\nfree-running laser in order to assess whether each comb line was\nretaining the spectral purity of the free-running laser. The laser\noutput power stability was also studied using a fast photode-\ntector (50-GHz bandwidth) and a sampling oscilloscope which\nwas triggered using a reference output from the frequency gen-\nerator. This allowed residual intensity modulation on the laser\noutput to be studied. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the absorp-\ntion of the modulation section will also change with the voltage,\nthus inducing intensity modulation. Monitoring intensity modu-\nlation also enables the transition to mode-locked operation to be\nobserved [21] when the modulation frequency is exactly equal\nto the axial mode spacing. The stability of the line spacing and\nits relation to the modulation source frequency were assessed\nby heterodyning two adjacent lines and sending the resulting\nsignal to the fast photodetector which was connected to a spec-\ntrum analyzer. Note that the filters were placed at the output of\nthe erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to reduce the am-\nplified spontaneous emission (ASE) level in the resulting spec-\ntrum. The phase noise as a function of the frequency offset was\nthen extracted and compared with the modulation source phase\nnoise.\nFig. 9 shows the output spectrum of the laser with and without\n24.4-GHz modulation. The modulation amplitude was chosen\nto be 2 V peak-to-peak signal with 2-V negative bias, where the\noutput spectrum was showing the highest number of comb lines\ncreated. With no modulation, lasing was on a single longitudinal\nmode. With modulation at frequencies much lower than the axial\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

When\nthe phase was changed in order to detune the laser axial fre-\nquency further from the modulation frequency, the number of\nlines diminished and was closer to the original peak frequency\nas expected for an FM laser. Note that the spectrum is not sym-\nmetric as for the ideal example given previously. This is mainly\ndue to the strong absorption on the short wavelength side of the\nspectrum, as, for this laser, the free-running peak wavelength\nwas in the short-wavelength side of the gain spectrum. Other\nlasers operating with a single free-running peak in the center of\nthe gain spectrum operated with a more symmetric comb spec-\ntrum, though the number of lines was smaller. This absorption\nis unavoidable as the intermixing was chosen to be the best bal-\nance between low absorption and strong index modulation. This\nFig. 10. Comb-lines linewidth measurement.\ntherefore limits the total span of the comb as it reduces the gain\nbandwidth. Furthermore, we believe that the trenches used to\nisolate the different sections, which create a system of coupled\nFabry\u2013Perot subcavities, are responsible for the lack of lines\ncreated at certain points of the spectrum (Fig. 9). The simulation\nresult, shown in Fig. 6 (for a simpler two-section cavity), indi-\ncates that such a cavity design induces higher losses in the cavity\nat frequency spacing determined by the length of the modulation\nsection. Though the real cavity was not simulated, it is reason-\nable to assume that a similar effect of zones of higher losses\nshould occur while the periodicity should not be as obvious.\nTo assess the quality of the created comb lines, their linewidth\nwas measured with the self-heterodyne system described previ-\nously, each line being extracted using a 0.1-nm 3-dB band-\nwidth filter (13 GHz). Fig. 10 shows the linewidth of different\ncomb lines at a given offset from the original free-running laser\nfrequency. As expected, the comb-line linewidth remains the\nsame as the linewidth of the free-running laser for all comb lines.\nThe linewidth was at its optimum for this laser, i.e., 25 MHz.\nAs a laser operating in the FM regime should show no inten-\nsity modulation, to confirm that the device was operating as an\nFM laser, the stability of its output power was measured with a\nfast photodetector both on a spectrum analyzer and on a sam-\npling oscilloscope. Fig. 11 shows the result obtained with the\nsampling oscilloscope at different points of operation. As one\ncan see, at most operation points, the output had almost no in-\ntensity modulation. However, up to 20% intensity modulation\nappears when the modulation frequency is close to the axial fre-\nquency. This was expected as the QCSE only slightly changes\nthe absorption of the modulation section. The spectrum ana-\nlyzer did also show a weak peak at 24.4 GHz when the modu-\nlation frequency was close to the cavity axial frequency, which\nis in agreement with the previous measurement. In theory, the\nlaser should transition to FM mode-locked operation when the\nmodulation frequency is exactly equal to the cavity axial fre-\nquency. When measured at this frequency the laser showed the\nsame behavior as with a small detuning (around 10 kHz), but\nno mode-locked regime was observed. It is likely that, in this\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 06:48 from IEEE Xplore.

Amplitude modulation measurement at different modulation points.\ndevice, the intracavity reflections combined with strong cavity\ndispersion prevented operation in the mode-locked regime.\nThis experiment was repeated with individual filtered comb\nlines in order to assess their intensity stability, and no differ-\nences were seen in the measurements compared with the mea-\nsured intensity modulation of the full output of the laser.\nIn order to confirm FM operation, the comb-line spacing\nshould be measured and its relation to the modulation fre-\nquency demonstrated. For this, we used the heterodyne system\ndescribed previously with 0.1-nm (13-GHz) bandwidth filters\non each branch of the system. This also offers the advantage of\nassessing the relative frequency stability of the line spacing.\nFig. 12 shows the heterodyne result for one given pair of\nlines. For this measurement, the spectrum analyzer span was\n100 kHz and the resolution bandwidth was 1 kHz. The line was\nat the exact frequency of the modulation source and had the\nsame spectral purity, as expected. Thus, as the comb lines were\nspaced by the modulation frequency, we could definitely con-\nclude that the device was operating as an FM laser. Phase-noise\nmeasurements were also made on the heterodyne signal to com-\npare it with the modulation source (Fig. 13). The phase-noise\nspectral density was obtained (estimated) from the RF power\nspectrum adjacent to the heterodyne signal (or the modulation\nsource signal) by normalizing to the peak power in the signal,\non the assumption that the phase noise dominates over ampli-\ntude noise [24]. The noise floor of the spectrum analyser was\naround 125 dBm\/Hz (check powers) or less for all frequency\noffsets, while the peak signal powers were around 10 dBm for\nthe modulation source and 10 dBm for the heterodyne signal,\ngiving noise floors for the phase noise measurements of around\nFig. 12.

Phase-noise measurement of the heterodyne signal from two adjacent\ncomb lines.\n135 and 115 dBc\/Hz, respectively. As can be seen, up to a\nfrequency offset of about 2 MHz, the phase noise is the same\nfor the source and the heterodyne signal; above this frequency\noffset, the noise floor of the spectrum analyzer is reached and no\ncomparison can be made. However, this shows that phase noise\nof 82 dBc\/Hz at 1-kHz offset and 108 dBc\/Hz at 1-MHz\noffset can be achieved.\nAn important issue for the use of this laser as a frequency\nreference is its absolute frequency stability. Typically, a semi-\nconductor laser will show an absolute frequency drift due to\nthe current source instability and thermal drift. The FM laser\nfree-running peak wavelength drift was measured over several\nhours by heterodyning the laser output with the output of a sta-\nbilized DFB laser (on a molecular resonance-acetylene-absolute\nfrequency stability 100 kHz) and observing it on an RF spec-\ntrum analyzer. It was found to be about 200 MHz with an ap-\nproximately linear drift for the duration of the measurement.\nThis indicates that the drift is mainly due to the control elec-\ntronics. Note that this corresponds to a change of the axial fre-\nquency of about 100 kHz. This is small enough to not affect\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In order to obtain a higher absolute\nfrequency stability, the laser will need to be locked on an atomic\nor molecular resonance [25].\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have shown the use of a combination of different fabri-\ncation techniques in the quaternary\/quaternary InGaAsP\u2013InP\nmaterial to realize a monolithic FM laser comb generator. First,\nthe bandgap of part of the wafer was blue shifted using QWI by\nshallow ion implant and rapid thermal processing (RTP). The\n35-nm bandgap shift obtained allowed low signal absorption in\nthe phase and modulation sections of the device. Second, the fab-\nrication of the device was made using oxide-bridge techniques to\nreduce the capacitance of the modulation section to 380 fF. This\nallowed for an efficient reverse bias modulation using QCSE at\n24.4 GHz, which was close to the 3-dB bandwidth of the modu-\nlation section (21 GHz). The optical frequency comb generator\ncould potentially offer 24.4-GHz spaced lines over a spectral\nwidth of 15 nm ( 2 THz). However, the complexity of the cavity,\ndispersion and the losses induced by the material were limiting\nthenumberof linescreatedof thepotential span.Thecreated laser\nlines were exactly spaced by the modulation frequency and the\nresidual intensity modulation was less than 20%. Each line had\nthe same linewidth of 25 MHz as the nonmodulated laser. When\nheterodyned, two adjacent lines gave a high-purity ( 82 dBc\/Hz\nst 1-kHz offset) frequency with phase noise limited by the\nfrequency source. Another limitation for the source is that its ab-\nsolute frequency stability is limited. A 200-MHz drift measured\nover a period of several hours was mainly due to the control elec-\ntronics. We believe that this could be solved by locking the laser\non an atomic or molecular resonance. We have isolated two main\nissues to tackle first in order to improve the performances of the\nmonolithic comb generator. They are the multiple-cavity struc-\nture and the span of the comb. For the first one, we plan to use ion\nimplantation as the section electrical isolation mechanism [26]\nin order to reduce the level of residual reflection. For the second\nissue, the use of distributed bandgap material will be investigated\nin order to increase the gain bandwidth [27] of the laser as well\nas, potentially, the modulation depth [28]. In that case, we believe\nthat such monolithic comb generators could provide a compact\nalternative to fiber-loop techniques with larger comb-line output\npowers than passive phase-modulator techniques.\nREFERENCES\n[1] O.
