Much\neducational technology literature focuses on developers and teachers describing and\nreflecting on their experiences. Few connections are made between these experiential\n\u2018stories\u2019. The data set is fragmented and offers few generalisable lessons. The field\nneeds guidelines about what can be learnt from such single-case reports. The pragmatic\nmeta-analytic studies described in this paper have two common aspects: (1) the cases\nare related in some way, and (2) the data are authentic, that is, the evaluations have\nfollowed a naturalistic approach. We suggest that examining a number of such cases is\nbest done by a mixed-methods approach with an emphasis on qualitative strategies. In\nthe paper, we overview 63 eLearning cases. Three main meta-analytic strategies were\nused: (1) meta-analysis of the perception of usefulness across all cases, (2) meta-\nanalysis of recorded benefits and challenges across all cases, and (3) meta-analysis of\nsmaller groups of cases where the learning design and\/or use of technology are similar.\nThis study indicated that in Hong Kong the basic and non-interactive eLearning\nstrategies are often valued by students, while their perceptions of interactive strategies\nthat are potentially more beneficial fluctuate. One possible explanation relates to the\nlevel of risk that teachers and students are willing to take in venturing into more\ninnovative teaching and learning strategies.\nKeywords: evaluation; meta-analysis; eLearning cases; risk-taking\nSummarising lessons learnt in naturalistic studies\nThere are difficulties with the so-called \u2018scientific research paradigm\u2019 for education\nresearch. These include the complexity of interrelated factors in most educational settings;\nresults from highly controlled scientific research designs not being replicable in real settings\n(Kember 2003); the difficulty of achieving matched groups in education; the \u2018diffusion\neffect\u2019 in controlled experimental designs in the same class or even institution whereby\n\u2018control groups can be contaminated\u2019 (Craven et al. 2001, 643) by the experience aspects of\nthe treatment; and the well known \u2018halo effect\u2019 (Thorndike 1920) whereby students who\nknow they are part of a treatment group perform better just because they think they are\ngetting special treatment.\nThe naturalistic research paradigm thus seems better suited to educational research\n(Alexander and Hedberg 1994; Grasha 1990). Certainly, there is a large body of educational\ntechnology literature that focuses on developers and teachers describing and reflecting on\ntheir experiences with eLearning (Beetham 2005). Innovations are implemented in authentic\neducational settings and the collection of evaluation data is done in non-intrusive ways with\n*Corresponding author. Email: paul.lam@cuhk.edu.hk\n62  P. Lam et al.\nas little influence on the teaching and learning environment as possible. Naturalistic evalu-\nation considers multiple perspectives and accepts that interpretation of interactions is not\nneutral and needs to be situated in a particular context of time and place (Froehlich 1994).\nNaturalistic research studies typically involve a mixed-methods approach with an\nemphasis on qualitative strategies, including observation, interviews, focus groups,\nquestionnaires, narratives, and video- and audio-tape recordings. Qualitative descriptions\n\u2018provide a depth to student behavior that is largely absent from traditional measurement\ntechniques\u2019 (Grasha 1990, 108). In the same vein, Runciman (2002, 146) noted that \u2018uncon-\nstrained by the need to reduce the data to a set of numbers, qualitative research may allow\nphenomena to be studied from more perspectives and in greater depth\u2019. Hammersley (1997)\nnoted that an overemphasis on quantitative methods is not justified in educational research.\nSimilar sentiments are echoed by Oliver and Conole (2003) who advocated the use of multi-\nple models in eLearning evaluation and research in order to avoid an overly narrow view on\nwhat constitutes evidence.\nSecondly, multiple sources of data are often collected in a naturalistic study because\nobtaining accurate representations with qualitative data is often challenging. Qualitative\ndata are often generated by small groups of students whose views may not represent the\nbroader population (Hughes and DuMont 1993). Opinions collected and interpreted can be\neasily influenced by the researchers\u2019 practice (Hague 1993). Triangulation of results\nthrough using multiple evaluation strategies is thus often used to build robust and more\ngeneral interpretations of phenomena (Guba 1981).\nThirdly, naturalistic evaluation studies may differ considerably. Different contexts and\nobjectives for using a particular innovation usually result in a different set of evaluation\nstrategies and instruments. The use of multiple sources of qualitative data makes comparing\nsuch studies even more difficult.\nConceptual framework\nThree terms are central to this paper \u2013 \u2018evaluation\u2019, \u2018pragmatic\u2019 and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. In\neducational evaluation, we propose that the intention is to gather evidence about the effec-\ntiveness of some educational practice or invention. The criteria for \u2018effectiveness\u2019 can vary\nmarkedly \u2013 evidence of \u2018an increase in convenience\u2019 is likely to be different from evidence\nof \u2018an enhancement of student learning\u2019. This is somewhat different from theory-oriented\nresearch where the intention is to develop or confirm specific theoretical constructs or\nmodels. While there is a clear overlap between evaluation studies and more theory-oriented\nresearch, the potential variety in design of evaluation studies brings a \u2018fuzziness\u2019 to the field\nand results in the need for guidelines about what can be learnt from single-case reports and\nwhich led to use of the term \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. We sought analytic strategies that could allow\nus to look across the data from a number of existing studies to reveal new patterns.\nIn this study, our objective was to use the experience that already exists to find sugges-\ntions for practice that might be, to some extent, generalisable to other contexts, even though\ngeneralisability is not always the aim of evaluation and, indeed, is rarely so in single case\nstudies.\nThe study was \u2018pragmatic\u2019 in the sense that we looked for flexible principles that could\nguide our interpretations of existing data sets.\nThe analysis focused on naturalistic studies because its aim is to inform practice. Qual-\nitative data play an important role because of the rich information they contain. We\npropose that generalisability of findings across a number of individual studies is enhanced\nusing the following logic: \nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   63\n\u25cf If a phenomenon is found in several studies, then the phenomenon is more likely to\nbe a general one.\n\u25cf If a simple general trend is not found, the meta-analysis across multiple cases may\nlead to the identification of some critical factors which can differentially affect\nsuccess or failure in different contexts.\nMethodology\nOur meta-analytic study involved small-scale studies undertaken during the e3Learning\n(enrich, extend, evaluate learning; e3L) project, which assisted teachers in using web-\nassisted teaching and learning in Hong Kong universities. It offered a range of design,\ndevelopment and evaluation services, and conducted a wide range of single-case eLearning\nevaluations. For each subproject or case, a team was formed whereby teachers had access\nto educational and technical support. Full details of the design of this project are in James\net al. (2003) and the project website (http:\/\/e3learning.edc.polyu.edu.hk). This paper\ndevelops the preliminary analysis in McNaught and Lam (2005a), involving the full e3L\ndata set and introducing two additional meta-analytic methods to build our understanding\nof the issues operating to affect eLearning in Hong Kong universities.\nA tailor-made evaluation design was adopted for each case in order to serve the best\ninterests of the individual teachers and cases (Lam and McNaught 2004). The customised\napproach resulted in highly individualised evaluation plans, questions and instruments,\ncontrasting sharply with generic evaluation methods where standardised evaluation instru-\nments are used across a range of sites. The process of evaluation consists of several\nstages: \n\u25cf working out the evaluation questions with the teacher;\n\u25cf choosing appropriate strategies to use in answering these questions;\n\u25cf developing an evaluation plan;\n\u25cf collecting data using the strategies selected (likely strategies were surveys, focus-\ngroup meetings, expert review and usability sessions), analysing the data;\n\u25cf reporting the evaluation results to teachers; and\n\u25cf assisting them in making decisions about what to do next.\nThis mechanism provided useful feedback that informed not only the teachers involved\nin each subproject but also other teachers interested in using the strategies (Lam and\nMcNaught 2008). Over a 30-month period, the e3L project supported the web development,\nimplementation and evaluation of 70 subprojects designed to actively assist teaching and\nlearning in courses. Sixty-three of these successfully reached the evaluation stage. The cases\nwere very different in nature; Table 1 shows the range of web-assisted functions involved.\nObviously, each of these cases involved usually more than one web-assisted function. We\nhave described the functions in two ways.\nThe first is the nature of the interactivity involved. Broadly speaking, interactivity can\nbe either between the learner and online materials and tasks, or between people using the\ncommunication functions. Column 1 shows the four classifications we used: \n\u25cf low interactivity, basically accessing static information and information basic to the\ncourse (Low int.);\n\u25cf students interacting with materials and tasks (Ss and \u2018stuff\u2019);\n\u25cf interactions about specific information (Info int.); and\n64  P.

In our e3L cases, the forums were used for: concept\nclarification, peer review, working on set cases, doing team assignments\/projects,\ndebates, socialising\/building community, special topics\/issues\/news, and self-\nreflection (Public).\nWe also classified the web-assisted functions in terms of four broad areas of web\nfunctions: \n\u25cf study management and skills support (Support);\n\u25cf resources\/content for learning (Content);\n\u25cf assessment and feedback to students (Feedback); and\n\u25cf communication between teacher and students (Discussion).\nThese classifications allowed the classification of eLearning strategies followed in the\nsubprojects. Seventeen such strategies were identified, based on both the technology use\nand learning design. For example, \u2018assignment submission\u2019 and \u2018exhibition of assignments\u2019\nwere differentiated since the former are primarily assignment dropboxes while the latter\nrelates to displaying students\u2019 work, often in forums. It should be noted that this classifica-\ntion is pragmatic, since it is linked to web functionality rather than student activity. It is,\ntherefore, different from student-focused classifications; for example Laurillard\u2019s (2002)\nclassifications of media types (attention, inquiry, discussion, practice and production) and\nConole\u2019s (2007) taxonomy of student activity (assimilative, information seeking and\nhandling, modelling, discussion, experiential and productive).\nOur match between these four web functions and the 17 web-assisted functions is shown\nin Table 1. Our 63 websites involved all the 17 web-assisted functions (Column 2), and we\nhad 115 instances of these in action (Column 5).\nTable 2 shows the diversity of the evaluation instruments used. These favoured self-\nreporting strategies such as surveys and focus-group interviews. As mentioned in McNaught\nand Lam (2005b), we had difficulty persuading teachers that data that directly address\nstudents\u2019 performance are desirable. Hong Kong has a culture that equates evaluation to\nusing student satisfaction questionnaires.\nThree main strategies were used to compare and contrast the lessons learnt in our 63\ncases: \n(1) meta-analysis of the perception of usefulness across all cases;\n(2) meta-analysis of recorded benefits and challenges across all cases; and\n(3) selecting cases that have employed similar strategies and doing a meta-analysis of\nsmaller groups of cases.\nPerception of usefulness meta-analysis\nWe used an iterative approach to rating each web-assisted function in the context of the\ncourse in which it was used. In general, the ratings were allocated to each function according\nto the following three criteria: \n(1) Amount of use: The amount of usage recorded concerning that particular function;\nfor example, the number of postings in forums, the number of attempts of quizzes,\nor the frequency of access to a particular resource. This information usually came\nfrom site logs and student surveys.\n66  P.

Judgements of quality involved two reviewers individually\nrating resources or analysing opinions using pre-agreed criteria and negotiating\ndifferences.\n(3) Perception of users: Opinions were collected from either teachers or students\n(informants) concerning the usefulness of the functions in supporting learning,\neither via a survey question or comments made in interviews. Sometimes,\ninformants were asked to rank the functions on a site according to their usefulness\nor when they indicated that they wanted particular functions to stay when the course\nis run again.\nAfter a significant amount of discussion, one score was assigned to each web-assisted\nfunction in each case. We used a 1\u20135 scale, with 1 being \u2018not useful\u2019 and 5 being \u2018very\nuseful\u2019. The interaction between the e3L team was essential here as we were called on by\nour colleagues to justify our decisions for any given case. The judgement involved two\nreviewers reviewing the relevant evidence. There was also, of course, checking between the\nratings given to a function across a variety of different course contexts. In this level of\nanalysis, the perceived usefulness of all the 63 evaluated cases was compared and\ncontrasted.\nMeta-analysis of learning benefits and challenges\nThe second meta-analysis was carried out to identify the general strengths and weaknesses\nof the eLearning strategies, concentrating on the qualitative data. Comments concerning\nbenefits and challenges were usually collected through open-ended questions in surveys,\nfocus-group meetings or teachers\u2019 reflections. In a few cases, students\u2019 performance in\nassignments or examinations was also considered.\nThe meta-analysis method involved the research team going over the evaluation reports\nfor each project and extracting the benefits and challenges mentioned in them.\nMeta-analyses of cases with similar themes\nThe meta-analysis of selected cases permitted a closer look at the eLearning strategies and\nthe factors essential to their success. Through concentrating on the individual eLearning\nstrategies in detail, the analyses were able to provide insights and suggestions concerning\ntheir use and usefulness in more detail than the overall meta-analyses outlined above.\nFindings\nPerception of usefulness: basic content is favoured\nFigure 1 shows a ranking of the measures of perceived usefulness for the 17 web-assisted\nfunctions. This is also shown in Table 3 to compare the ranking with our dual classification\nof the functions. The data indicate that the most appreciated features concentrate on the\nprovision of content; even provision of simple, static content is more highly valued than\ninteractive strategies (four out of the top 10 belong to \u2018low int.\u2019). This is in special contrast\n68  P. Lam et al.\nwith those that require human to human communication (\u2018info int.\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019). The only\nexception may be the use of the \u2018creation and exhibition of multimedia projects\u2019 strategy,\nranked third. This highly creative and student-centred activity made it very successful in\nboth of the instances studied.\nFigure 1. Ranking of perceived usefulness of the various web-assisted functions.It is useful to look at the four \u2018top\u2019 ranked functions: learning tools such as glossaries,\nnotes and PowerPoints, assessment tasks associated with grades, and creation and exhibition\nof multimedia projects. These all have rankings of 3.5 or higher on a five-point scale.\nThe highest ranked function is the provision of learning tools such as glossaries. One\nexplanation is that, in Hong Kong, English is classified as a foreign language, and the\nstandard of English is a matter of concern. It is not surprising that online dictionaries and\nglossaries of technical terms, especially with audio pronunciations or visual material, are\nhighly valued. However, as universities in most western countries now cater for a wide\ninternational student mix, this finding may well be of broader interest.\nThe second ranking goes to notes and PowerPoint resources. Requiring low interactiv-\nity, and often highly didactic, these tools are, however, often treasured by teachers. It\nwould seem that, although researchers advocate uses of the web that are interactive and\nseek to develop students\u2019 critical thinking, problem solving, information literacy,\ncommunication, etc., this will not be valued until the overall curriculum patterns in many\nuniversities change. Content-dominated curricula and a focus on end-of-course formal\nexaminations with predictable patterns year to year are well supported by \u2018notes on the\nweb\u2019. Students, who understandably wish to succeed in the current system, wisely value\nthese resources.\nIn the same vein, graded assessment tasks are valued. Without grades, assessment is less\nvalued; for example, exhibition of assignments and project\/assignment archives get the\nlowest rankings. However, positively, both instances in this group were good quiz\nexemplars, providing useful feedback to students. What is important to Hong Kong students\nis that they get marks for the work they do.

Ranking of perceived usefulness of the various web-assisted functions.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   69\nperform well in other assessments is not popular at all. It is a question of maximising the\nvalue from all time spent studying. Again, language may be a contributing factor: in many\nHong Kong courses, the written materials are in English even when classes are in a hybrid\nEnglish and Chinese mode. Students\u2019 reading speeds in a second language restrict the\namount they wish to read, making them more strategic. Again, however, language\nchallenges now exist in virtually all universities, and so this may have wider relevance.\nThe fourth highly ranked function is the creation and exhibition of multimedia\nprojects. There were two instances of this in our case pool, one in public health and one in\nEnglish. It is heartening that this function was seen to be effective. So, despite the\ncomments made above about the overall didactic nature of higher education in Hong\nKong, if course expectations are clear and oriented towards creative work, students will\nreact accordingly.\nLearning benefits: basic content is not favoured\nDespite content-based eLearning strategies being very highly rated for perceived useful-\nness, the analysis on the level of reported benefits found that communication-rich strategies\nhave great potential.

Lam et al.\nreports in the 63 cases. These remarks were further grouped under the four main types of\neLearning strategies: low interactivity, students and \u2018stuff\u2019, information interactivity, and\npublic (the first column of the table). The numbers in the cells indicate the number of times\na benefit was recorded for a strategy in our cases.\nThere were many comments that the \u2018low interactivity\u2019 content was able to improve\nlearning, ease downloading content, enhance problem-solving and analytical skills through\nthe readings, and even change some of the students\u2019 learning habits so that they are more\nready to review and prepare for lessons. However, comments on these benefits were not as\nstrongly or widely voiced as on more interactive types of content and communication\nstrategies.\nThe interactive \u2018Students and \u201cstuff\u201d\u2019 type of strategies, for example, were considered\nto improve learning through revision and practice. With these strategies, the learning envi-\nronment became more attractive and learning activities more varied. Multimedia materials\nin particular were considered to be excellent tools for students to view and review operational\nprocedures. Self-directed learning was also enhanced; students remarked that they were\nmotivated to learn by the new media.\nThe benefits of the teacher and student communication in the \u2018information interactivity\u2019\nstrategies were also impressive. Students mentioned better learning, increased interest in\nlearning, and better communication with teachers. The benefits were not as strong, perhaps\nbecause there were fewer successfully implemented cases of this type in our study.\nThe benefits of the \u2018public\u2019 strategies were clear. Students learnt through seeing different\npeople\u2019s perspectives, and some through exchanging ideas with people in another culture.\nThe learning environment was considered to be very engaging. Many types of learning skills\nwere related to this by students: e.g. language skills (students had to express themselves\nclearly in communication), critical skills, argumentative skills and analytical skills. Lastly,\nattitudinal changes such as being more willing to cooperate were noted.\nChallenges: basic content is safe\nThe analysis shows great differences among our eLearning strategy types. Table 5 illustrates\nthe challenges mentioned in our cases, grouped under the four main eLearning strategies.\nThe numbers in the cells are the frequencies of the challenges.\nInteractive content and communication strategies were considered to have more chal-\nlenges than the simple non-interactive strategies. While the \u2018low interactivity\u2019 strategies\nmight fail technically (e.g. when downloading was problematic or slow) or in design (e.g.\nassigning too much reading for the students), in general the strategies were safe and\nsuccessful.\nThe interactive \u2018Students and \u201cstuff\u201d\u2019 strategies, however, were demanding in all of the\nfour areas identified. For example, in terms of perception challenges, students could treat\nthe additional learning materials as unimportant and not pay attention to them. Technically\nspeaking, more complicated materials led to problems with correct display on students\u2019\ncomputers, and there were database problems and data loss. The importance of a good inter-\nface for complicated tasks was also prominent. As for the learning content, more complaints\nwere received about quality and quantity, since interactive materials are generally more\ndifficult to create, resulting in fewer being developed and some not reaching high quality\nstandards.

These were demanding in\nterms of teachers\u2019 participation, responsiveness to questions, and the quality of feedback to\nstudents.\n\u2018Public\u2019 eLearning strategies were also difficult. Students lacked motivation to partici-\npate, resisted because they prefer face-to-face discussions, found some communication tools\nnot to be user-friendly, and perceived a lack of teacher participation, especially when clar-\nifications were needed. Tasks need clear and adequate guidelines to lead students through\nthe activities. Even with a very good design, cooperative group work is usually time-\nconsuming.\nThus \u2018benefits and challenges\u2019 analysis indicates that more interactive strategies are also\nconsidered more challenging to teachers and learners. However, they have the potential to\ndeliver more learning benefits than the simpler, non-interactive strategies.\nLessons learnt from groups of similar cases\nThe third type of meta-analysis focuses on studies of cases using similar strategies. Four\nsuch analyses have been done, focusing on the challenging, interactive strategies. This\nallows the formulation of a list of the factors influencing the success of specific strategies\nacross multiple contexts.\nLam and McNaught (2006a) examined three media-rich cases (a \u2018Students and \u201cstuff\u201d\u2019\nstrategy). The paper reports on the design and evaluation of the online courses and explores\nwhether media-rich experiences can enrich learning at the full range of knowledge types and\nlevels of cognitive reasoning outlined in the Revised Bloom\u2019s taxonomy (Anderson and\nKrathwohl 2001). There was qualified support for benefits to student learning. The study\nalso highlighted factors that influence success: attention to the quality and design of the\nmedia, considering student motivation, and focusing on feedback on learning during the\ncourse. Media and learning design thus are inextricably intertwined.\nMcNaught et al. (forthcoming) also studied more complex developments of the \u2018Students\nand \u201cstuff\u201d\u2019 type. It is rare to see failures in eLearning projects reported in the literature.\nThe e3L cases that were not completed were examined to see why these were unsuccessful.\nThe cases were: two sites with large numbers of high-quality video clips; two sites with flash\nanimations that had to be scientifically very accurate; one detailed factory simulation; one\nrole-play CD-Rom; and one portfolio system. Many challenges were uncovered. Each of the\ndifferent stages (planning and development, implementation, dissemination, and evaluation)\nis critical and we analysed the challenges in each of these stages. Some challenges related\nto human factors \u2013 personal (e.g., workload) and interpersonal factors (mostly communica-\ntion issues between teachers and development teams). These challenges can be compounded\nby external factors such as technological infrastructure, university policy and support, and\nthe teaching and learning culture as a whole. One can view the development process as an\nintersection of a large number of factors that need to intersect in a mutual comfort zone.\nSadly, this synergy does not always occur.\nThe third study addressed \u2018public\u2019 eLearning strategies, involving 13 reasonably active\neducational online forums (McNaught, Cheng, and Lam 2006). Data included student and\nteacher surveys, student focus groups, analysis of forum postings and examination of forum\nlog data. Structured forums with a defined purpose generally had a higher quantity and\nquality of postings than free forums; student-centred fora (involving more student\u2013student\ncommunication) were also of higher quality than discussions where communication was\nmostly from teacher to student. Further, analysing evaluation feedback from students and\nteachers identified three key factors that tend to affect forum success \u2013 ease of use, clear\n76  P. Lam et al.\nfacilitation and motivation to engage. The centrality of the role of the teacher was\nconfirmed.\nLastly, Lam and McNaught (2006b) examined web-enabled communication in six cases\ninvolving peer- and group-assessment activities. These cases involved three web strategies\n\u2013 e-resources (using the web to deliver materials for discussion), e-display (displaying work\nfor peers to critique) and e-communication (students discussing online). The data generally\nconfirm that web-enabled peer- and group-assessment activities can produce positive\nresults. However, these assessment activities need careful planning, as several factors affect\noutcomes. For example, the e-display function is not as popular as e-resources (in line with\nthe first meta-analysis discussed above). Here, this was due to technical challenges: students\nwill only upload work if it is easy to do so. Regarding e-communication, the importance of\ngroup dynamics and participation was highlighted. The skills needed to work effectively\nonline are not the same as basic IT competency skills. In our cases both teachers and\nstudents were relative novices in online learning, since even students who have spent\nconsiderable time online may not be experienced in formal online learning situations.\nDiscussion\nTable 6 summarises the main observations from the meta-analyses. Web functions that are\nbasic and non-interactive, contrary to expectations, were perceived as more useful strategies\nthan interactive ones. However, non-interactive strategies supported improvement in basic\nlevels of knowledge, skills and attitudes, whereas other strategies were associated with\nlearning at the higher levels. So, why would the pedagogically less beneficial strategies be\nmore welcome?\nHigh-risk, high-return\nOne explanation, highlighted in Table 6, concerns the high level of investment and risk\nteachers and students take in carrying out interactive strategies. As noted elsewhere, skills\nare needed in developing (Falconer 2007) and implementing online strategies (Moule 2007).\nTable 6.

Expected learning benefits were broadly confirmed in successful appli-\ncations of these strategies, but various factors affect these outcomes such as the quality of\nthe materials (particularly for multimedia), the design of activities, the readiness of teachers\nand students to participate and the support available.\nUsing a meta-analytic approach\nThe findings reveal that greater understanding can be achieved through comparing and\ncontrasting naturalistic studies of eLearning use. Quantitative data may not always be\ndirectly comparable, as instruments and data vary. Qualitative data, on the other hand,\nyielded categories of description that could be analysed.\nPragmatic meta-analysis can also support generalisation across cases in terms of over-\nall usage patterns, what works well and what does not (challenges), the strengths and\nweaknesses of a certain innovation and strategy, and factors influencing outcomes. This\nmakes use of the many isolated and fragmented naturalistic studies that exist, and may\nhelp practitioners become better informed about the designs of innovations and eLearning\nstrategies.\nThere are obvious limitations to this approach. As mentioned above, our naturalistic\neLearning studies were heavily biased towards perception data rather than data on actual\nperformance. Oliver and Conole (2003) called these \u201cproxies for performance\u201d and there is\na tendency \u201cto measure what is easily measured\u201d (389). Generalisability of meta-analysis of\nthis kind depends on both the quality and quantity of the individual studies available.\nIt is also interesting to note that pragmatic meta-analysis is not restricted to the study of\ncompleted or successful cases. As illustrated by our study of the seven incomplete cases,\nless satisfactory experiences can be very revealing.\nConclusion\nWe have suggested three pragmatic strategies for meta-analyses of naturalistic evaluations.\nNaturalistic eLearning studies vary in the evaluation techniques used, but the meta-analyses\ndescribed in this paper can integrate findings and insights from studies with quite different\ndesigns.\nThis study indicates that basic and non-interactive eLearning strategies are often most\nwelcome, while perceptions of more beneficial interactive strategies can fluctuate. This\nreflects that interactive strategies require support, and skills in development and implemen-\ntation. It is a high-risk, high-return approach, and it seems that few teachers are currently\nwilling to take this risk. However, several factors can interfere with these complex strategies.\nThere are lessons for teachers embarking on an eLearning project, staff who support the use\nof technology in universities \u2013 both in terms of technical support and educational design \u2013\nand those responsible for developing institutional policy about the effective use of technol-\nogy in teaching and learning.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding from the University Grants Committee in Hong Kong is gratefully acknowledged, as is the\ncollaborative support of colleagues in our three universities.
