Workers involved in former gasholders 3 \ndecommissioning are potentially exposed to relevant concentrations of volatile and semi-4 \nvolatile hydrocarbons upon opening up derelict tanks and during tar excavation\/removal. 5 \nWhile information on contaminated sites air-quality and its implications on medium-long 6 \nterm exposure is available, acute exposure issues associated with the execution of critical 7 \ntasks are less understood. Calculations indicated that the concentration of a given 8 \ncontaminant in the gasholder vapour phase only depends on the coal tar composition, 9 \nbeing only barely affected by the presence of water in the gasholder and the tar 10 \nvolume\/void space ratio. Fugacity modelling suggested that risk-critical compounds such 11 \nas benzene, naphthalene and other monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 12 \nmay gather in the gasholder air phase at significant concentrations. Gasholder emissions 13 \nwere measured on-site and compared with the workplace exposure limits (WELs) 14 \ncurrently in use in UK. While levels for most of the toxic compounds were far lower than 15 \nWELs, benzene air-concentrations where found to be above the accepted threshold. In 16 \naddition due to the long exposure periods involved in gasholder decommissioning and the 17 \nsignificant contribution given by naphthalene to the total coal tar vapour concentration, 18 \nthe adoption of a WEL for naphthalene may need to be considered to support operators in 19 \npreventing human health risk at the workplace. The Level I fugacity approach used in this 20 \nstudy demonstrated its suitability for applications to sealed environments such as 21 \ngasholders and its further refining could provide a useful tool for land remediation risk 22 \nassessors. 23 \n24 \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION 1 \nManufactured Gasworks plants (MGP) were using underground structures, such as 2 \nredundant former gasholders, to collect and store coal tar, a valuable by-product of coal 3 \ngasification (Hatheway, 2006). However the conversion to natural gas in the 1960s and 4 \nthe subsequent decommissioning of the gasworks sites have left numerous underground 5 \nstructures many of which were backfilled and contain coal tar contaminants. Coal tars are 6 \ndense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) containing hundreds of hydrocarbons 7 \nincluding monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as BTEX compounds (Benzene, 8 \ntoluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 9 \nsuch as naphthalene and benzo[a]pyrene (Kueper et al, 2003). The relatively high density 10 \nand high viscosity of coal tars imply that they may persist in the environment acting as a 11 \nsource of contamination for soils, sediments, surface and groundwater. In addition coal 12 \ntars have been identified as posing a threat to human health due to their toxic, mutagenic 13 \nand carcinogenic characteristics (Brown et al., 2006; Kueper, 2003). Due to the constant 14 \nneed of new land for housing, brownfield remediation has been a fast growing part of the 15 \nUK environmental industry in recent years. Recently, remediation activities have been 16 \ninitiated on various former gasworks sites. Under both the Health and Safety at Work Act 17 \n(1974) and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (2002), remediation 18 \ncompanies are required to ensure that risks to workers\u2019 health are reduced as much as 19 \nreasonably possible. Previous exposure assessments at MGP remediation sites have not 20 \nshown excessive concentrations of risk-critical compounds within the workplace. 21 \nHowever, peak concentrations on shorter periods of time have been reported to occur 22 \nduring critical tasks in the proximity of heavily contaminated sites (Foster, 2006; Lingle 23 \net al 2006). In addition, as former gasworks are often frequently located in the vicinity of 24 \nresidential and public places impacts on external receptors need to be considered.  25 \nThe aim of the present study is to investigate the dependences between the level 26 \nof risk-critical compounds found at the workplace, their concentration within the coal tar 27 \nand the gasholder specificities. A fugacity approach was used to predict to which extent 28 \ncoal tar constituents migrate into the vapour phase. To validate the fugacity model, a coal 29 \ntar sample collected from an in-filled gasholder under remediation was characterized and 30 \nused to set laboratory scale microcosms simulating the gasholder characteristics. On-site 31 \n 4 \nmeasurements of tank emissions were carried out and the results were compared with the 1 \nworkplace exposure limits (WELs) currently used in the UK.  2 \n 3 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 4 \nField site and sampling  5 \nCoal tar was collected from an underground tank used initially as gasholder and then 6 \nconverted into a tar storage facility. The gasholder has a diameter of approximately 9 7 \nmetres and a depth of 4 metres. Its content was a highly viscous semi-solid tarry sludge 8 \nwith an significant amount of trapped mineral debris. Before remediation of the tank was 9 \nundertaken, a bulk 5 kg tar sample was collected to analyse the hydrocarbon content of 10 \nthe tar matrix and its vapours. The sample was stored one week at 4\u00b0C prior to analyses. 11 \nVOC emissions were sampled during the third day of remediating the gasholder. 12 \nExcavation was still on going and a considerable amount of DNAPL\/sludge was present 13 \nin the tank. Emissions were sampled (i) inside the gasholder (3 metre depth), (ii) at 10 14 \nmetres from the border and (iii) off-site (background level). During sampling, 15 \nengineering activities were interrupted to minimise emission contribution from vehicle 16 \nexhausts. Samples were collected using standard stainless-steel sorbent cartridges, 17 \ncontaining dual packing comprising 50% Tenax TA and 50% Carbotrap (Markes 18 \nInternational Ltd, UK). Air was drawn through the sorbent cartridges using a portable 19 \nbattery-powered FLEC pump at a controlled flow rate of 50 ml min\n-1\n for 10 minutes. 20 \n 21 \nChemical analyses 22 \nDuplicate tar samples (5 \u00b1 0.05 g) were chemically dried with 5 g of anhydrous sodium 23 \nsulphate. Extraction procedure and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis 24 \nconditions have been previously described (Coulon and Delille, 2006).  25 \nCaptured volatiles were analysed using an AutoSystem XL gas chromatograph equipped 26 \nwith an ATD 400 thermal desorption system and TurboMass mass spectrometer (Perkin 27 \nElmer, Wellesley, MA). Cartridges were desorbed by purging for 2 min at ambient 28 \ntemperature then for 5 min at 300\u00baC. Volatiles purged from the cartridge were captured 29 \non a cold trap which was initially maintained at 30\u00baC. The trap was then heated to 320 \u00baC 30 \nand maintained at that temperature for 5 minutes whilst the effluent was transferred to 31 \n 5 \nthe gas chromatograph via a heated (180 \u00baC) transfer line coupled directly to a Zebron 1 \nZB624 wall-coated open tubular column (dimensions 30m\u00d70.4mm\u00d70.25mm ID) 2 \n(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The gas chromatograph oven was maintained at 50 \u00baC for 3 \n4 min following injection and the temperature was then raised at 10 \u00baC.min\n-1\n to 220 \u00baC 4 \nand held at this temperature for 9 min. The mass spectrometer was operated using the 5 \nfull scan mode (range m\/z 33 to 350). The resulting mass spectra were combined to form 6 \na total ion chromatogram (TIC) by the GCMS integral software (TuboMass version 4.1). 7 \n 8 \nConceptual model definition 9 \nA site conceptual model has been developed to identify sources, pathways and receptors 10 \nto be considered in the risk assessment. Four phases may be found within the gasholder, 11 \nnot all of them are necessarily present and volumes vary across a wide range of scenarios: 12 \n(1) fill material composed of soil or sediment saturated with tar, (2) DNAPL (coal tar) 13 \nmay be found at different densities and viscosities. (3) Water may have reached the tank 14 \nfrom rainfall or condensation or been originally present as aqueous liquors or emulsions. 15 \n(4) Vapour phase occupying the void space. The relative volumes of the four phases of 16 \nthe gasholder investigated were as follows: fill material 90 m\n3\n, DNAPL 60 m\n3\n, water 35 17 \nm\n3\n, void space 65 m\n3\n. Since the risk assessment addresses occupational human health and 18 \nsafety issues, the considered receptors are the workers (healthy subjects between 16 and 19 \n60 years) involved with on-site remediation. \u201cWorkplace\u201d is defined as the area where 20 \nremedial activities (lid removal, digging, loading\/piling) are being undertaken i.e. from 21 \nthe tank border to 10-20 m distance. Workers may be exposed to contaminants through (i) 22 \nsoil ingestion (ii) inhalation of contaminants present in the gaseous phase or adsorbed 23 \nonto fine particles (iii) dermal contact after deposition of soil particles on the cutaneous 24 \nsurface (Dor, 2005). In this assessment, only the inhalation pathway has been considered.  25 \n 26 \nLevel 1 fugacity calculation 27 \nThe characteristics of the coal tar sludge were used to parameterise a level I fugacity 28 \nmodel representative of the gasholder environment. The distribution of the contaminants 29 \nwithin the different phases was then modelled under different scenarios. It has been 30 \nassumed a sealed gasholder containing four compartments: air (vapour phase), water, 31 \n 6 \nDNAPL and soil (fill material). The total mass of contaminant in the tank (M, mol) is 1 \ngiven by:   2 \nM = VAirCAir + VWaterCWater + VDNAPLCDNAPL + VSoilCSoil    (1) 3 \nwhere V represents volume of each compartment (m\n3\n), and C represents the 4 \nconcentrations of contaminant in each compartment (mol m\n-3\n). The relationship between 5 \nCNAPL, CAir, CWater, CSoil can be expressed in terms of partition coefficients characterising 6 \nthe behaviour of the contaminant within the system. For example, the partition coefficient 7 \nrelating the DNAPL and water concentrations is given by: 8 \nCDNAPL  \/ CWater = KDNAPL\/Water        (2) 9 \nThus, the total mass of contaminant inside the tank can be expressed as follows: 10 \nM = VAir[KAir\/WaterCWater] + VWater[KWater\/DNAPLCDNAPL,KWater\/AirCAir] + 11 \nVDNAPL[KDNAPL\/SoilCSoil,KDNAPL\/WaterCWater] + VSoil[KSoil\/DNAPLCDNAPL]  (3) 12 \nUnder the Fugacity approach, the concentration term, C, is replaced with the fugacity 13 \nterm Zf (Eq.4) where Z describes the relationship between chemical concentration and 14 \nfugacity (f) (Mackay, 2001). The fugacity capacity constants used in the model are shown 15 \nin table 1. 16 \nC = Zf           (4) 17 \nIn-filled gasholders are sealed environments where each environmental compartment 18 \nconsidered is expected to be in equilibrium with each other. Thus, fugacity values of each 19 \ncompartment are considered as equal (Eq. 5) 20 \n fDNAPL = fS = fA = fW         (5) 21 \nand the equation 3 may be rewritten as: 22 \nM = f[VAirZAir + VWaterZWater +VDNAPLZDNAPL+ VSoilZSoil] = f \u03a3ViZi   (6) 23 \nThe mass of coal tar, soil and water were calculated using literature-derived densities: 24 \ncoal tar was assumed to have an average bulk density of 1.1 g cm\n-3\n (Lee et al., 1992); soil 25 \nwas assumed as 2.4 g cm\n-3\n (Nieman, 2003) and water 1 g cm\n-3\n. The percent of organic 26 \ncarbon of soil was estimated as 0.5% (Nieman, 2003). Thirteen different compounds were 27 \nmodelled (BTEX, styrene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, 28 \n 7 \nacenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene). Due to their physicochemical 1 \nproperties (e.g. Henry\u2019s law constant, high Kow and Koc), concentrations of PAHs with 4 2 \nor more rings were neglected in the air phase as they were expected to be insignificant. 3 \n 4 \nMicrocosms experiment 5 \nDuplicate microcosms were established in sterile 250 ml vial bottles where volumetric 6 \nratio between each phase was maintained as those found on-site: tar sludge (10%), water 7 \n(7%) and air (83%). The sealed void space was created on the top of the bottle using 8 \nTeflon foil normally used for VOC sampling bags. VOC samples were collected at T0 9 \n(immediately after preparing the experiment) and after 21 days (T21). Between the two 10 \nsamplings, the microcosms were stored under a fume hood cabinet in darkness at 20\u02daC.  11 \n 12 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION 13 \nCharacterisation of the total petroleum hydrocarbons from the tar sample showed 14 \npredominance of aromatic compounds with respect to aliphatic compounds confirming 15 \nthe coal-based nature of the tar. Concentration and relative abundance of 54 individual 16 \nPAHs have been characterised (Table 2). The total PAH concentration was estimated to 17 \nbe 49261 \uf0b1 865 (\uf0b1 SD) mg kg-1. The prevalence of lighter PAHs was clearly observed; 2 18 \nand 3 rings PAHs represented together more than 80% of the total PAHs, and the latter 19 \naccounted for half of the 16 USEPA PAHs. Four rings PAHs represented about 8% 20 \nfollowed by 5 and 6 rings PAHs at 6% and 3%, respectively. The sum of the 16 USEPA 21 \nPAHs represented two third (63.6%) of the total PAHs. By far, naphthalene (12448 mg 22 \nkg\n-1\n) and phenanthrene (10069 mg kg\n-1\n) were the most abundant compounds representing 23 \n25% and 20%, respectively of the total PAHs. Other 16 USEPA PAHs, such as 24 \nacenaphthylene, anthracene, pyrene and benzo[k]fluoranthene were found at relatively 25 \nhigh concentrations (> 1300 mg kg\n-1\n). Benzo[a]pyrene, often used as a reference for 26 \nhuman health risk driver in contaminated soil, is present in smaller amounts (517 mg kg\n-\n27 \n1\n). Concentrations of dibenzothiophenes, especially of the mono-alkylated species (5,267 28 \nmg kg\n-1\n, >10%), are higher than the levels reported in the literature (Brown et al, 1999 29 \nand 2006; Lee et al, 1992). The abundance of lighter PAHs such as naphthalenes and 30 \nphenanthrene\/anthracene suggested unweathered characteristics of the coal tar sample. 31 \n 8 \nThis observation is supported by results of previous studies (Brown et al, 2006; Haeseler, 1 \n1999 et al; Sauer et al, 2003) demonstrating that gasholders being sealed environments, 2 \nhamper weathering processes of the contaminants. 3 \nThe total VOC concentration representing the sum of 49 volatile\/semivolatile 4 \norganic compounds was estimated to be 3452 mg m\n-3\n. Concentrations of the most 5 \ndominant compounds are shown in Table 3 (T0 initial characterisation). These 6 \ncompounds are also expected to be a source of concern in the workplace. As predicted 7 \nfrom the PAH characterisation, high concentrations of naphthalene were observed (above 8 \n150 mg m\n-3\n). Alkylated monocyclic aromatic compounds and BTEX were also found in 9 \nrelatively high amounts and BTEX represented more than 20% of the total VOC mixture, 10 \nwith benzene being determined at an elevated concentration of 88 mg m\n-3\n. Benzene is 11 \nrecognised as a carcinogenic compound on the basis of human exposure and naphthalene 12 \nis regarded as a possible carcinogen (category 3 carcinogen in CHIP regulations; HSE, 13 \n2005). Alkylated monocyclic aromatics such as toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, 14 \ntrimethylbenzenes are classified as toxic and harmful by the UK (CHIP) and EU health 15 \nand safety regulations (HSE, 2005). In addition, nitrogenated compounds were found at 16 \nhigh concentrations (e.g. propiolonitrile 363.4 mg m\n-3\n, benzonitrile 285.6 mg m\n-3\n). 17 \nAnalyses also identified high concentrations of dimethyl sulphide (250 mg m\n-3\n), 18 \nthiocyanic acid (122.1 mg m\n-3\n) and halogenated hydrocarbons (difluorochloromethane, 19 \nchloromethane). The current UK WEL is as low as 5 mg m\n-3\n for cyanides, 43 mg m\n-3\n 20 \ndifluorochloromethane and 105 mg m\n-3\n for chloromethane. Thus these compounds may 21 \nfurther increase the hazardous potential of the coal tar emissions from the gasholder.  22 \nVOC and SVOC measured inside the gasholder, at the workplace and on a 23 \nbackground semi-rural environment are shown in Table 4. When WELs were available 24 \nthey were displayed together in the table (HSE, 2005). Background concentrations of 25 \nrisk-critical compounds such as BTEX were < 0.1 or not detected. Gasholder 26 \nmeasurements showed high concentrations of benzene, other monocyclic aromatic 27 \nhydrocarbons and naphthalene. About the same relative proportion between these 28 \ncompounds was found in the workplace measurements. Benzene, toluene and 29 \nnaphthalene showed concentrations in the workplace of respectively 6.9, 5.2 and 7.7 mg 30 \nm\n-3\n. The benzene concentration is two fold higher than the WEL set by HSE. With the 31 \n 9 \nintroduction of the EH40\/2005 WELs list (HSE, 2005), naphthalene is no longer assigned 1 \na WEL value (previous WEL was 53 and 80 mg m\n-3\n for long and short term exposure, 2 \nrespectively). Naphthalene is a possible carcinogen and its concentration in the workplace 3 \nshould be kept as low as reasonably practicable. However, due to the long exposure 4 \nperiods involved in gasholder decommissioning and the significant contribution given by 5 \nnaphthalene to the total coal tar vapour concentration, the adoption of a WEL for 6 \nnaphthalene may need to be considered to support operators in preventing human health 7 \nrisk in the workplace. 8 \nLab-scale microcosm analysis and fugacity level I calculations were used to 9 \npredict the partitioning behaviour of the organic compounds from the coal tar. The 10 \npresence and residual concentration of PAHs contributing more than 0.5% of the total 11 \nPAH concentration in water after 21 days of experiment are shown in Table 5. A clear 12 \nprevalence of 2 and 3 ring-PAHs was observed. This finding was predictable as the 2 and 13 \n3 ring-PAHs have lower molecular weight and higher solubility than the >3-rings PAHs. 14 \nNaphthalenes and indene together accounted for approximately 70% of the mixture of 15 \nconsidered compounds. Theoretical concentrations of 14 PAHs in water calculated 16 \nthrough the fugacity approach were compared with the experimental data as shown in 17 \nFigure 1. A good correlation between the calculated and the experimental results for the 18 \n14 selected PAHs was observed except for naphthalene where the calculated 19 \nconcentration (3200 mg m\n-3\n) was twice as high as the experimental one (1550 mg m\n-3\n) 20 \n(data not shown in Figure 1). This may be due to volatilization of naphthalene from the 21 \nwater during the sampling procedures.  22 \nThe microcosm air phase characterisation after 21 days of experiment is shown in 23 \nTable 3. Overall, higher VOC\/SVOC concentrations were observed in the air phase. 24 \nParticularly, naphthalene and BTEX concentrations have increased by at least 2 times. 25 \nThis is probably due to the fact that the three week time period allowed coal tar vapours 26 \nto gather at higher amounts within the microcosm air phase. The expected concentration 27 \nof naphthalene and BTEX in the air phase according to the fugacity calculation also 28 \nshowed a good correlation with the experimental data (Table 3). Thus, it was found 29 \nappropriate to attempt quantifying the concentration of BTEX in the bulk tar sample by 30 \nusing the same approach. This was done by changing the known factor in the level I 31 \n 10 \nfugacity model and proceeding backwards with the calculation. The results were as 1 \nfollows: benzene 200 mg kg\n-1\n, toluene 800 mg kg\n-1\n, ethylbenzene 2000 mg kg\n-1\n, o-xylene 2 \n1500 mg kg\n-1\n and p-xylene 1900 mg kg\n-1\n. These predicted values are in good agreement 3 \nwith previous studies where BTEX concentration from coal tar within gasholders was 4 \nmonitored (Brown, 2006; Sauer, 2003; Majoub, 2000).  5 \nThree scenarios were modelled to evaluate parameters influencing VOC flux from in-6 \nfilled tanks: (i) tank almost full with tar (S1); ii) tank almost empty (S2) and (iii) tank 7 \nwith a profile similar to the investigated gasholder. The air phase concentrations of 8 \nBTEX and naphthalene vary only slightly between the three different scenarios 9 \nconsidered (data not shown). Average concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were 10 \nestimated to be 360 mg m\n-3\n and the total average BTEX concentration was approximately 11 \n325 mg m\n-3\n. Due to their low fugacity in the DNAPL phase, concentrations of 12 \nacenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene did not exceed 1.5 13 \nmg m\n-3\n.\n \nThis finding suggested that the concentration of contaminant (CVP) in the air 14 \nphase was dependent and directly proportional to its concentration in the coal tar (CTAR), 15 \nthe source term. Consequently, the following equation was deducted:  16 \nCVP = K*CTAR  17 \nwhere K represented the constant relating CVP and CTAR. As shown in Table 6, K value 18 \ndecreased with the molecular weight (MW) of the considered compounds. If the coal tar 19 \nfingerprint characterisation can be determined before the remediation activities start, 20 \ndetermination of K values may provide a valuable tool when predicting vapour emission 21 \nconcentrations from in-filled tanks. The application of these results to real structures can 22 \nsupport the risk assessment process applicable to the remediation of former MGP. 23 \nFollowing the lid removal, operations may need to be stopped to permit the contaminant 24 \nconcentrations in the workplace to drop down to safe levels. By using the fugacity 25 \napproach, remediation engineers can also predict if such measures will be needed and the 26 \nduration of any such interruption period during the remediation activities. 27 \n 28 \nCONCLUSION 29 \nIn-filled tank remediation activities may be a cause of concern due to the exposure of 30 \nworkers to the risk-critical compounds present in the coal tar mixture. VOCs and SVOCs 31 \n 11 \nmay gather at significant amounts within the tank air phase and contribute to acute 1 \nexposure levels, especially immediately following the lid removal. The fugacity approach 2 \nproved to be a promising tool to predict the concentration of contaminants within the 3 \ngasholder air phase. This mainly depends on the coal tar composition regardless the 4 \npresence of water within the tank or the different volumetric proportions between 5 \ncompartments. Risk of not complying with regulatory workplace exposure limits are 6 \nmainly linked with the presence of benzene. Due to its carcinogenic profile, values for 7 \nbenzene are set very low and, as observed in the site-specific exposure assessment, may 8 \nbe exceeded for critical tasks involving proximity to heavily contaminated structures such 9 \nas gasholders. Naphthalene was found to be the most abundant contaminant in the 10 \nworkplace environment. Protracted exposure to naphthalene vapours should be 11 \nconsidered due to its suspected carcinogenic nature. 12 \n 13 \nAcknowledgements 14 \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of NationalGrid in this project.
