Introduction\nNumerous researchers using data from the postwar 1971 floating\nperiod have replicated the forward premium puzzle, which is that the\nforward premium is inversely related to future exchange rate changes\nor the excess return, as initially documented by Fama (1984).1 In an\nimportant insight, Lyons (2001) provided a further reason to explain\nthe forward premium puzzle. Lyons pointed out that the forward bias\nwill not attract speculative funds until this trading strategy is\nexpected to generate an excess return per unit of risk that exceeds\nthat of other trading strategies. As a consequence, there is a band of\ninaction in which the forward bias will persist until the bias is\nsufficiently large to attract speculative funds.2\nRecently, Sarno et al. (2006) have reported estimates of nonlinear\nmodels for the recent floating period that capture this band of\ninaction. Their empirical results provide support for the Lyons\nhypothesis. Given this, it seems worthwhile to provide further\nempirical evidence on this hypothesis using data for a different time\nperiod when trading conditions were radically different and there\nwere apparently large departures from covered interest arbitrage.\nThis period is the interwar floating period.In order for the forward exchange rate to provide an unbiased\npredictor of the future spot rate it is necessary that both covered and\nuncovered interest parity hold. In postwar data this is found to be the\ncase for covered interest arbitrage, up to small fractions, in studies\nemploying high quality data (see e.g. Taylor, 1987, 1989; Akram et al.,\n2008). However, this does not appear to be the case for periods of the\ninterwar float.\nIn a recent paper, Peel and Taylor (2002) present a study of\ncovered interest arbitrage in the interwar foreign exchange market of\nthe 1920s. In particular, employingweekly data on spot, forward rates\nand interest rates, they provide evidence on a conjecture primarily\ndue to Keynes (1922, 1923) and given further emphasis by Einzig\n(1937, 1961, 1962). What may be termed the Keynes\u2013Einzig\nconjecture has two components. First, that covered arbitrage between\nthe major financial centres in the interwar period was only triggered\nonce the deviation from covered parity exceeded about 1\n2\n% (that is, fifty\nbasis points) on an annualized basis. Second, that evenwhen arbitrage\nwas triggered, deviations were arbitraged away only slowly because\nof the less than perfect elasticity of supply of arbitrage funds. For\ninstance, Einzig writes \u201cDeviations of a lasting nature were liable\nto arise, however, among other reasons, because the liquid capital\navailable for arbitrage was not unlimited and at times it was not large\nenough to bring about readjustment\u201d (Einzig, 1962, p. 275).\nPeel and Taylor (2002) report empirical results consistent with the\nKeynes\u2013Einzig conjecture. Given that arbitrage only occurred when\ndeviations from covered interest arbitrage were sufficiently large it\nfollows a fortiori that the uncovered arbitrage will not hold so that the\nforward rate will not be an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate\nFig. 1. Deviations from covered interest parity (cip) in the interwar period.\n56 I. Paya et al. \/ Economics Letters 108 (2010) 55\u201357except by chance. Given this point we re-examine the relationship\nbetween excess returns and the forward premium making allowance\nfor deviations from covered interest arbitrage employing weekly data\nfor the period December 1921 until May 1925. The rest of the letter is\nstructured as follows. In Section 2 we set out our model. In Section 3\nwe describe the data, the empirical method and present the results.\nSection 4 is a brief conclusion.\n2. Forward premium puzzle\nA standard regression estimated in the literature to determine the\npredictability of foreign exchange excess returns n periods ahead is\n(e.g. Fama, 1984)\nst + n\u2212ft = \u03b1 + \u03b2 ft\u2212st\u00f0 \u00de + vt + n \u00f01\u00de\nwhere st+n is the logarithm of the spot exchange rate at time t+n, ft\nis the logarithm of the forward rate for horizon n, \u03b1, and \u03b2 are positive\nconstants, and vt+n is an error term that can follow up to an n\u22121\nmoving average error term under the null of efficiency. The ex-post\nexcess return is st+n\u2212 ft, and ft\u2212st is the forward premium. When\nagents are risk-neutral, have rational expectations, and covered and\nuncovered parity hold we would obtain estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b1 that do\nnot differ significantly from zero.\nTheessenceof thehypothesis of Lyons is that limits to arbitrage imply\nthat within a certain band the forward bias does not attract capital and,\nas a consequence, the spot and forward rate may not mover together.\nIn our setting, we modify the Fama specification to endeavour to\ncapture this effect as follows\nst + n\u2212ft = \u03b4 + \u03b8 ft\u2212st\u00f0 \u00dee\u2212\u03bb cipt\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n+ et + n \u00f02\u00de\nwhere \u03b4, \u03b8 and \u03bb are constants, and et+n is the error term. We note\nthat, if \u03bb is zero in the above regression, we obtain the standard Fama\nregression (1), and therefore the Fama regression is nested.3 It is also\npossible to rewrite Eq. (2) as the alternative Fama regression\nst + n\u2212st = \u03b4 + \u03b8e\n\u2212\u03bb cipt\u00f0 \u00de2 + 1\n\u0001 \u0003\nft\u2212st\u00f0 \u00de + et + n \u00f03\u00de\nThe assumption captured by Eq. (2) is that when deviations from\ncovered interest parity are large, inducing speculative flows, the\nforward premium per se, will become a more accurate forecast of\nfuture changes in expected spot rates. Consequently, as deviations\nfrom cip become large in the above regression the coefficient on the\nforward premium becomes smaller, so that the bias of the forward\npremium as a predictor of future changes in spot rates becomes\nsmaller.4 The smooth transition adjustment captures the idea of\nheterogeneous traders with different trading limits.5\nWe also note that if it is assumed that the unobservable\nexpectation of the excess return, Etst+n\u2212 ft, is proportional to\ndeviations from covered interest parity (cip) we obtain the regression\nestimated by Sarno et al. (2006). That assumption would allow us in\nprinciple to solve for a consistent (rational) expectation which would\nbe a complex function solely of the forward premium (see Peel and\nVenetis, 2005). Taking expectations of Eq. (2) generates the implied\nrational expectation in this model. However, no closed form exists for\nestimation purposes and therefore we estimate Eq. (2) directly.3 Similarly, one could write Eq. (2) using a first order approximation and obtain the\nfollowing expression where the Fama regression is more explicitly nested when \u03bb=0 this\nequation\nst + n\u2212ft = \u03b4 + \u03b8\u00f0ft\u2212st\u00de + \u03b1\u00f0ft\u2212st\u00decip2t + et + n\nNote that \u03b1=\u2212\u03bb\u03b8; and therefore when \u03bb=0 this equation becomes Eq. (1).\n4 Note that the transition function in Eq. (2), e\u2212\u03bb(cipt)2, is bounded between 0 and 1.\n5 For full details see Sarno et al. (2006).3. Data and results\nThe UK interest rate, TB3, quoted as an annual percentage is a\nninety-day Treasury bill rate reported for Saturday in the London\nnewspaper The Economist during the period. The US interest rate,\nPBA, quoted on an annual percentage, is for a Saturday quotation on\nthe discount on ninety-day prime bankers' acceptances in New York\nCity, published in Banking andMonetary Statistics, 1914\u20131941 (Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System 1943). These interest rates\nare for similar assets of the same maturity and quoted at the same\npoint in time.\nEinzig (1937) provides weekly quotations for spot and three-\nmonth dollar\u2013sterling forward exchange rates for each Saturday in the\ninterwar period, originally gathered from the weekly circular of the\nAnglo-Portuguese Colonial and Overseas Bank.6 Deviations from\ncovered interest parity on an annual basis, cip, are calculated as follows\ncipt = TB3t\u2212PBAt + 400 4 fpt \u00f04\u00de\nwhere fpt is the forward premium calculated from the Einzig data as\nfpt= ft\u2212st=log(St\u2212(NY3\/100))\u2212 log(St) where St is the dollar\u2013\nsterling spot rate and NY3 is the forward discount over 13 weeks\nquoted in cents. The excess return, for the three-month (or thirteen\nweek) period is calculated as\nst + 13\u2212ft = log\u00f0St + 13\u00de\u2212log\u00f0St\u2212\u00f0NY3= 100\u00de\u00de \u00f05\u00de\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the deviations from covered interest arbitrage.We\nobserve that deviations are persistent and varied between, approx-\nimately, 1.2 and \u22121.3% on an annual basis.\n3.1. Empirical results\nThe use of multi-period overlapping horizons when computing\nreturns induces dependence in the error term structure of regres-\nsions (1) and (2). Moreover, test statistics based on Newey\u2013West\nstandard errors can be seriously biased in small samples. A method\nthat corrects for that bias is the block bootstrap. In particular, we use\nthe moving block bootstrap method where blocks of length l are\nresampled from the residuals 7 so as to preserve the dependence\nstructure of the data. 8 We follow the Politis and White (2004)96 The data is available from the authors upon request.\n7 Where the residuals resampled are those from estimates of the restricted\nregression.\n8 Patton et al. (2008) show that the moving block bootstrap is more accurate than\nthe stationary bootstrap of Politis and Romano (1994).\n9 The procedure we actually use is the correction of the Politis and White (2004)\ndone by Patton et al. (2008).\nTable 1\nStandard Fama regression, 1921\u20131925.\n3-month: st+13\u2212 ft=a+\u03b2( ft\u2212 st)+ \u0002t\na \u03b2 s R2\n0.0174 \u22125.21 0.0255 0.21\n(0.0045) (1.49)\n[0.045]\nNotes: Figures in brackets are the Newey\u2013West standard errors.\ns denotes standard error of the regression.\nFigures in square brackets represent the p\u2212value of the coefficient obtained by Block\nBootstrap simulation.\nBlock length l=15. using Patton et al.

Paya et al. \/ Economics Letters 108 (2010) 55\u201357optimal block length selection procedure to deal with the critical issue\nof determining length l.\nIn Table 1 we report the standard Fama regression results. The\nforward premium has a negative point coefficient of \u22125.21,\nqualitatively similar to results for the postwar floating period and\nthe coefficient is significantly different from zero on the basis of both\nthe Newey\u2013West and bootstrapped standard errors.\nIn Table 2 we report estimates of the nonlinear model (2).10 We\nobserve that, on the basis of the Newey\u2013West or the Politis andWhite\nbootstrapped standard errors, the coefficient for the deviation from\ncovered interest parity is negative and significantly different from\nzero at standard levels of significance.\nFig. 2 depicts the values that the transition function (e\u2212\u03b3cipt\n2\n) takes\nin the sample period depending on the values of cipt. This measures\nthe impact of deviations from covered interest parity on the forward\npremium bias. The function is smooth and symmetric around zero\nand reaches its minimum values when deviations from covered are\nlarge (around 1% and \u22121%). The transition function lies in the range\n[0.08, 0.99] which implies that the coefficient on the forward\npremium, \u03b8e\u2212\u03b3cipt\n2\nin Eq. (2), will lie in the range of [\u22120.60, \u22127.48].\nWhilst the coefficient does not take the value of zero, which could\nreflect the presence of a time-varying risk premium, it does take\nvalues much closer to zero than the one initially implied by the\nstandard Fama regression. It is also worth pointing out that a value\nof\u22120.60 in \u03b8e\u2212\u03b3cipt2 implies a coefficient of 0.40 in (\u03b8e\u2212\u03b3cipt2+1) and a\nstable error correction model in the Fama regression (3). Note that\nthis result is in contrast to the implication of non-cointegration, ceteris\nparibus, which follows from the negative coefficient on the forward\npremium obtained in the linear estimation in Eq. (3).\n4. Conclusion\nRecent empirical work on the floating postwar period has\ndemonstrated that nonlinear models that allow for bands of inaction\ndue to lack of arbitrage funds, the Lyons hypothesis, can provide some\nexplanation of the forward premium puzzle. The Lyons hypothesis\nseems to be particularly relevant to explain the forward premium\npuzzle in the interwar period when deviations from covered interest10 Estimation of Eq. (3) yields identical results.arbitrage were persistent and often large. We examined data for the\ninterwar period for the dollar\u2013sterling exchange rate and found that\nthe degree of bias in the standard Fama regression varies significantly\nwith the deviation from covered interest parity. When deviations are\nlarge, the degree of bias is much smaller than implied by the standard\nFama regression.\nAcknowledgement\nIvan Paya is grateful for the financial support from the Spanish\nMinisterio de Educacion y Ciencia Research Project ECO2008-05721\/\nECON.\nReferences\nAkram, Q.F., Rime, D., Sarno, L., 2008.
