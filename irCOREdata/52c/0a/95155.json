Baurdoux\nUniversiteit Utrecht\nbaurdoux@math.uu.nl\nAbstract\nIn this short note we show that the method introduced by Beibel and\nLerche in [1] for solving certain optimal stopping problems for Brownian\nmotion can be applied as well to some optimal stopping problems involving\nprocesses with one-sided jumps.\nKeywords: Optimal stopping problems, spectrally negative L\u0013evy processes, stable\nprocessses, generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.\n1 Introduction\nIn [1] Beibel and Lerche proposed a method for solving certain optimal stopping\nproblems for a Brownian motion B. They used a change of measure to reduce\nthe optimal stopping problem to the problem of \fnding the maximum of a\n(deterministic) function. One example solved in [1] is\nsup\nfi\nE\n\u0014\nBfi\nfi + 1\n\u0015\n: (1)\nThis problem was \frst solved in ([5], Theorem 1) and, independently, in ([6],\nExample 2). In section 10 of [5] it was suggested that it is of interest to replace\nB in (1) by a stable process of index \u000b 2 (1; 2). In this note we show that in\nsome cases, the method proposed in [1] can be used as well for processes with\none-sided jumps. In particular, for a spectrally negative strictly stable process\nof index \u000b 2 (1; 2) we solve the problem (1) in two ways : \frstly by a change\nof measure similar to the one used in Problem 3 in [1] and secondly by using\nresults from [3] about generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.\n2 Alphabolic boundaries\nDenote by fXtgt\u00150 a spectrally negative strictly stable process of index \u000b 2\n(1; 2) de\fned on (\n; fFtgt\u00150;P), a \fltered probability space which satis\fes the\n1\nusual conditions. We denote by Px the translation of P under which X0 = x:\nWithout loss of generality we assume that the Laplace exponent of X is given\nby  (\u0015) = \u0015\u000b. We refer to Chapter VIII in [2] and Chapter 3 in[4] for further\ndetails about stable processes. Let \f > 0 and de\fne the (\fnite) function\nH(x) =\nZ 1\n0\neux\u0000u\n\u000b\nu\u000b\f\u00001du:\nSuppose h is a function on R such that there exists some x\u0003 satisfying\nx\u0003 = argmax\nx\nh(x)\nH(x)\n: (2)\nDenote by T the set of stopping times with respect to fFtgt\u00150. The aim of this\nsection is to \fnd the optimal stopping time in\nV (x) := sup\nfi2T\nEx\n\"\nh\n\u0000\n(fi + 1)\u00001=\u000bXfi\n\u0001\n(fi + 1)\f\n1ffi<1g\n#\n: (3)\nWe have the following result.\nTheorem 1. Let h be a function on R such that x\u0003 in (2) exists. Suppose\nx < x\u0003. The optimal stopping time in (3) is given by\nfi\u0003 = infft \u0015 0 : Xt = (t+ 1)\n1=\u000bx\u0003g:\nFurthermore\nV (x) =\nh(x\u0003)\nH(x\u0003)\nH(x):\nProof. By changing variables y = u(t+ 1)\u00001=\u000b we \fnd that\nH((t+ 1)\u00001=\u000bXt) =\nZ 1\n0\neu(t+1)\n\u00001=\u000bXt\u0000u\n\u000b\nu\u000b\f\u00001du\n= (t+ 1)\f\nZ 1\n0\neyXt\u0000y\n\u000bt\u0000y\u000by\u000b\f\u00001dy:\nSince feyXt\u0000y\n\u000btgt\u00150 is a martingale, it follows that fMtgt\u00150 de\fned by\nMt =\nH((t+ 1)\u00001=\u000bXt)\nH(x)(t+ 1)\f\nis a mean 1 martingale under Px. Hence for any Px stopping time fi we have\nthat\nEx\n\u0014\nh((fi + 1)\u00001=\u000bXfi )\n(fi + 1)\f\n1ffi<1g\n\u0015\n= Ex\n\u0014\nH(x)\nh((fi + 1)\u00001=\u000bXfi )\nH((fi + 1)\u00001=\u000bXfi )\nMfi1ffi<1g\n\u0015\n\u0014 H(x)\nh(x\u0003)\nH(x\u0003)\nEx[Mfi1ffi<1g]\n\u0014 H(x)\nh(x\u0003)\nH(x\u0003)\n;\n2\nand thus\nfi\u0003 := infft \u0015 0 : (t+ 1)\u00001=\u000bXt = x\n\u0003g\nis the optimal stopping time if we can show that Px(fi\n\u0003 < 1) = 1 and that\nEx[Mfi\u0003 ] = 1. By the law of iterated logarithm for spectrally negative stable\nprocesses (see Theorem 5 (ii) in [2]) we deduce that for any x < x\u0003\nPx(fi\n\u0003 <1) = 1:\nAlso, since H is an increasing function and since (fi\u0003 + 1)\u00001=\u000bXfi\u0003 \u0014 x\n\u0003 we\ndeduce that for x < x\u0003 and any n 2 N\nMfi\u0003^n \u0014\nH(x\u0003)\nH(x)\nunder Px:\nWe use the optional sampling theorem and bounded convergence to conclude\nthat\n1 = lim\nn!1\nEx[Mfi\u0003^n]\n= Ex[Mfi\u0003 ]:\nThis completes the proof.\n3 Generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nLet Z be a spectrally negative L\u0013evy Process de\fned on a \fltered probability\nspace (\n; fFtgt\u00150;P) satisfying the usual conditions. The Laplace exponent  \nof Z is given by\n (\u0015) =\nff2\n2\n\u00152 + a\u0015+\nZ 0\n\u00001\n\u0000\ne\u0015x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0015x1fx\u0015\u00001g\n\u0001\n\u0005(dx); \u0015 \u0015 0:\nAgain we refer to [2] for further details. The Generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess fYtgt\u00150 is the solution to\ndYt = \u0000\u0015Ytdt+ dZt; Y0 = y under Py:\nLet r > 0. In this section we consider optimal stopping problems of the form\nU(y) := sup\nfi2T\nEy[e\n\u0000rfig(Yfi )1ffi<1g]; : (4)\nwhere g belongs to a class of functions which is yet to be speci\fed. Assume that\nff > 0 or a\u0000\nZ 0\n\u00001\nz\u0005(dz) > \u0015y; (5)\nsince otherwise the Generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process never hits points\nb > y with probability one (see Remark 1 in [3]). Clearly (5) is satis\fed when\n3\nZ is of unbounded variation.\nTo simplify we also assume that\nE[log(1 + (\u0000Z1)\n+)] <1: (6)\nDenote\nffi(u) =\n1\n\u0015\nZ u\n0\n (v)\nv\ndv:\nIntroduce for r > 0\nG(x) =\nZ 1\n0\neux\u0000ffi(u)u\u00001+r=\u0015du\nand\nNt = e\n\u0000rtG(Yt): (7)\nTheorem 1 in [3] states that under the assumptions (5) and (6) the process\nfNtgt\u00150 is a martingale for any r > 0. Introduce the locally equivalent measure\nQ by\ndQy\ndPy\n\f\f\f\f\nFt\n=\nNt\nG(y)\n:\nWe see that (4) can be written as\nU(y) = G(y) sup\nfi2T\nEQy\n\u0014\ng(Yfi )\nG(Yfi )\n1ffi<1g\n\u0015\n:\nTheorem 2. Suppose g is a function on R such that g=G attains its maximum\nat y\u0003 and suppose that fZtgt\u00150 is a spectrally negative L\u0013evy process satisfying\n(6) and\nff > 0 or a\u0000\nZ 0\n\u00001\nz\u0005(dz) > \u0015y\u0003:\nThen for any Y0 = y < y\n\u0003 the optimal stopping time in (4) is given by\nff\u0003 = infft \u0015 0 : Yt = y\n\u0003g:\nFurthermore\nU(y) =\ng(y\u0003)\nG(y\u0003)\nG(y):\nProof. Let y < y\u0003. It su\u000eces to prove that ff\u0003 is almost surely \fnite under Py\nand Qy. The \frst statement is contained in Theorem 2 in [3]. The proof of the\nsecond statement is similar to the end of the proof of Theorem 1.\nDenote by Y (\u000b) the generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which has a\nspectrally negative strictly stable process X(\u000b) with index \u000b 2 (1; 2) as driving\nL\u0013evy process and for which \u0015 = 1=\u000b and Y\n(\u000b)\n0 = 0. It is not di\u000ecult to show\n4\nthat e\u0000t=\u000b(X(\u000b)(et \u0000 1)) is equal in distribution to Y\n(\u000b)\nt (they have the same\nLaplace exponent). We deduce that\nsup\nfi\nE\n\"\nX\n(\u000b)\nfi\nfi + 1\n#\n= sup\nfi\nE\nh\ne\u0000fiX(\u000b)(efi \u0000 1)\ni\n= sup\nfi\nE\nh\ne\u0000(1\u0000\u000b\n\u00001)fiY (\u000b)fi\ni\n:\nHence for a spectrally negative strictly stable process we can also solve (1) by\napplying Theorem 2 to the case g(x) = x and r = (\u000b\u0000 1)=\u000b.\nAcknowledgement This note was written during a stay at Heriot-Watt Uni-\nversity, Edinburgh and I would like to express my gratitude for their hospitality\nand support.
