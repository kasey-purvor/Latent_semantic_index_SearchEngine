Introduction: the accumulation of motile cells near surfaces\nSperm and other cells that swim with a single flagellum (or \u2018tail\u2019) are known to\naccumulate \u2018near\u2019 or \u2018at\u2019 surfaces; for example Rothschild (1963) famously observed\nthe \u2018non uniform distribution of sperm in a drop of bull semen\u2019. Motile sperm are\ntypically observed at high concentrations near the upper and lower inner surfaces of\nflattened glass capillary tubes and close to the microscope slide or coverslip in wet\npreparations. In human sperm the effect of gravity has not been observed to have\na significant effect, so that the number of cells accumulating on upper and lower\nsurfaces is typically similar (Winet, Bernstein & Head 1984). The phenomenon has\nlong interested researchers, particularly at the interface of mathematical modelling\nand experimental biology (Winet et al. 1984; Lauga et al. 2006). However despite\na number of studies involving both hydrodynamic modelling and microscopy, the\nphenomenon has not been fully explained.\nFauci &McDonald (1995) used the immersed boundary technique to simulate sperm\naccumulation in a two-dimensional flow regime, equivalent to a swimming sheet\nin three-dimensional flow. Their simulation allowed for fluid\/structure interaction\nbetween the beating tail and fluid, to show gradual movement of a sperm-like swimmer\nwith a circular head towards an elastic solid interface, as well as phase locking between\nnearby cells. The underlying physical mechanisms for the accumulation effect however\nhave not yet been explored in detail using this methodology. Lauga et al. (2006)\nmodelled Escherichia coli as spherical cells with a single helical tail representing the\nflagellar bundle and were able to give fundamental explanations for both the forces\nattracting cells to the boundary and the circular swimming paths that cells follow, by\nanalysing the mobility tensors associated with the cell body and tail respectively. The\nhydrodynamic trapping effect is due to the fact that a cell body moving along and\nvery near an interface will be subject to a torque rotating it towards the surface as it\nmoves forwards. Due to its relatively large size, the effect of the E. coli cell body is\nmore significant than any slender body effects on the flagellum. Trapping mechanisms\nfor bacteria are different from mammalian sperm due to fact that the cell body is\nnot nearly as small relative to the flagellum and that bacteria are in the sub-micron\nscale regime, where electrical effects due to the ionic properties of the surface may be\nimportant over distances of the order of 10\u2013100 nm. Further discussion of trapping\nmechanisms for bacteria is given by Vigeant et al. (2002).\nWoolley (2003) investigated rodent and ram sperm and described two different\nsurface-trapping effects: (a) Cells which roll as they swim exhibit a conical beat\nenvelope, so that when approaching a boundary they enter a configuration in which\none edge of the cone is aligned with the surface such that the central axis, and hence\nthrust vector, points into the surface, as shown in figure 1(a). (b) Cells which exhibit\nplanar beating near surfaces and are such that the plane of flattening of the sperm\nhead is tilted relative to the beat plane, are subject to a \u2018hydrofoil\u2019 effect as shown in\nfigure 1(b). An alternative description of this model is that a lubrication layer exists\nin the space between the cell body and glass surface and that again the propulsive\nforce of the tail is directed at an angle into the surface. Woolley (2003) has presented\nexperimental evidence for this inclination angle in mouse sperm, and noted that\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 291\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. The models proposed by Woolley (2003) for boundary accumulation of (a) cells\nthat roll as they swim, sweeping out a \u2018conical envelope\u2019, and (b) planar beating cells such that\nthe beat plane is inclined to the plane of flattening of the head. Further description is given in\nthe text.\nsuch cells only swim with one particular face against the surface. Surface-trapping\neffects also occur in the sperm of externally fertilizing species such as sea urchin when\nexamined in vitro. Cosson, Huitorel & Gagnon (2003) imaged motile sea urchin sperm\ncells from Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula to show also that an out-of-plane\ncomponent of the beat appears to result in a directional thrust towards the surface.\nTheir three-dimensional model of the sea urchin beat pattern is essentially a pair of\nsuccessive helicoids of opposite polarity.\nIn this study we explore the phenomenon of surface accumulation of cells with\nthe proportions and characteristic beat patterns of human sperm. We investigate\nthe behaviour of both planar and rolling motilities in the vicinity of a surface and\nsimulate the fluid dynamics of the surface accumulation mechanisms proposed by\nWoolley (2003), applied to human sperm.\n2. Fluid dynamical modelling of flagellar cell motility\n2.1. Slender body theory and resistive force theory\nThe landmark paper \u2018Analysis of the swimming of organisms\u2019 (Taylor 1951) gave\nthe first mathematical treatment of the propulsion of a flagellum-like object due to\ntravelling bending waves. Taylor advanced one of the two main principles underlying\nself-propulsion in a purely viscous regime: \u2018resultant force which the fluid exerts on\nthe body must be zero\u2019. Along with the principle of zero resultant torque later used\nby Chwang & Wu (1971), these principles are fundamental to all theoretical studies\nof flagellar motility.\nThe analysis had certain features which are different from sperm swimming: the\norganism was represented as a swimming sheet, propagating small-amplitude bending\nwaves along its length. The small-amplitude assumption is not precisely valid for the\nsperm of most mammalian species but is appropriate for the sperm of the starling\n(Vernon & Woolley 1999) and has been exploited in studies of the effect of viscoelastic\nproperties (see for example Fulford, Katz & Powell 1998; Lauga 2007, the latter being\na substantial direct extension of Taylor\u2019s work). Taylor extended his analysis to the\nthree-dimensional flow around a cylindrical body performing planar small amplitude\nbeating, and produced an experimental model sperm which swam by propagating\nspiral waves (Taylor 1952).\nHancock (1953) coined the term \u2018Stokeslet\u2019 for the singularity solution due to a\npoint force in Stokes flow and used line distributions of Stokeslets and potential\ndipoles with varying strengths to represent the flow due to the finite-amplitude\nbeating of a flagellum \u2013 the basis of slender body theory (SBT) for Stokes flow.\n292 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C. Kirkman-Brown\nSBT is applicable in any situation where a slender body propels fluid or itself in a\nvery-low-Reynolds-number Newtonian regime and allows cell movement and fluid\nflow in a three-dimensional domain to be calculated much more efficiently than by\nsolving the Stokes flow equations directly. Hancock was able to show mathematically\nhow a slender body translating tangential to its axis is subject to approximately half\nof the drag compared with if it translates normal to its axis, a fact which is crucial to\nzero-Reynolds-number fluid dynamics and the functioning of flagella and cilia. This\nis referred to as the \u2018anisotropy ratio\u2019 of a slender body. The local approximation to\nSBT, \u2018resistive force theory\u2019 (RFT) was first developed by Gray & Hancock (1955)\nand used to analyse sinusoidal planar flagellar beating of sea urchin sperm. They\napproximated the force on an element of the flagellum as being proportional to the\nrelative velocity of the segment and the fluid, with different \u2018resistance coefficients\u2019\napplying to motions normal and tangential to the segment axis. Consideration of this\nanisotropy ratio allowed elementary mathematical and intuitive arguments for how\nflagellar wave propagation causes motility. The vast majority of quantitative studies\nof flagellar fluid dynamics have made use of either SBT or RFT, including the present\nstudy.\nAt the same time as the theoretical analysis, Gray (1955) conducted the first\nobservations of flagellar movement, on sperm of the sea-urchin Psammechinus miliaris\nswimming in sea water. Data had not previously been available due to the fact that\nthe flagellum is too small to visualize using conventional bright-field microscopy, and\nits movement is too rapid to be discerned clearly by eye. Gray (1955) solved these\ntechnical problems by employing dark-field microscopy together with stroboscopic\nillumination. At frequencies of 30\u201340 Hz, the flagellum was \u2018frozen\u2019 so that the\nwaveform could be observed. Continous lighting revealed \u2018flagellar envelope\u2019. This\nalternated between resembling an ellipse and a straight line, which led Gray to infer\nthat the cell was rolling with a frequency of around 3 Hz and that the flagellar beat\nenvelope was approximately planar.\nDespite the internal 9 + 2 structure of the flagellum being discovered around the\nsame time, it was not agreed whether the flagellum possessed a mechanism for the\nactive production of bending. By analysing the motion of an elastic beam, combined\nwith a simple RFT model of viscous forces, Machin (1958) showed that the emerging\nwaveforms did not resemble those found by Gray (1955) and others. By introducing\na simple model of active bending proportional to curvature he was able to produce\nwaveforms that gave a much better qualitative agreement with observations. Later\nMachin (1963) used a similar analysis to show that nearby flagella will tend to\nsynchronize. Many studies followed, applying RFT to the analysis of forces and\nbending moments due to observed beating patterns, for example Brokaw (1965, 1970)\nand Rikmenspoel (1965). RFT has also proved very successful in the modelling of\nbeat pattern production by the interaction of internal mechanics and viscous forces\n(examples with further references are Hines & Blum 1978; Brokaw 1985).\nGray (1953) noted that in the case of the cell body being small, helical propulsion\nwould likely be ineffective. This was analysed in more detail by Chwang & Wu\n(1971), who took into account formally the condition of zero net torque and hence\nwere able to model motility due to a rotating helical tail. Genuinely helical waveforms\nof sperm flagella are likely to be relatively rare, with for example the remarkable\nimages of Woolley & Vernon (2001) being observed for sea urchin sperm in medium\nwith viscosity of approximately 4 Pa s. Nevertheless, sperm of many species roll as\nthey swim which can only occur due to the existence of non-planar components of\nthe flagellar beat.\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 293\nPironneau & Katz (1974) used RFT to present insights into optimally energy-\nefficient beating by examining the small-amplitude case. Extensive work (see for\nexample Brokaw 1972; Hines & Blum 1983; Brokaw 1985) was conducted using RFT\nto couple internal mechanics and fluid mechanics to understand the emergence of\noscillatory propulsive waves. Researchers have continued to use RFT to investigate\na number of scientific questions. Examples are (i) Brokaw (2002) in investigating\nbeat pattern emergence in combination with detailed modelling of flagellar internal\nmechanics, (ii) Kinukawa et al. (2005) in finding new interpretations of flagellar beat\ndata and (iii) as reviewed above Lauga et al. (2006) on the trapping of bacteria near\nsurfaces.\nIn the mid-1970s, researchers turned their attention to incorporating boundary\neffects which are important for mammalian sperm both in vitro and in vivo. Katz,\nBlake & Pavieri-Fontana (1975) adapted RFT to modelling slender body motion\nnear and parallel to a surface. They noted that RFT was only strictly valid applied\nto small-amplitude motions and concluded, \u2018. . . our understanding of flagellar and\nciliary movement and function has reached a level where finite-amplitude theories are\nneeded. We hope that they will be forthcoming\u2019. While Hancock was only able to\nmake limited progress by analytical methods, by the 1970s it was possible to calculate\nnumerical solutions of the SBT integral equation for the force distribution on the\nflagellum. There are two basic approaches that have been pursued in such numerical\ncalculations: (a) applying surface-velocity collocation directly to Hancock\u2019s SBT as in\nHigdon (1979a, b) or a variant of it as in Smith, Gaffney & Blake (2007) and Clarke\net al. (2006); (b) working with an approximation of Hancock\u2019s representation based on\n\u2018integrating out\u2019 the local Stokeslet\/dipole contributions, as first pursued by Lighthill\n(1976) and later by for example Johnson (1977, 1980), Dresdner, Katz & Berger\n(1980), Gueron & Liron (1992), Fulford et al. (1998) and Gueron & Levit-Gurevich\n(2001).\nSignificant work had been carried out on perturbation-theory analysis of slender\nbody motion up to the mid-1970s (reviewed in Smith et al. 2007). Shen et al. (1975)\npresented the first study of finite-amplitude swimming of a headless filament, based\non the theory of Cox (1970), which expanded the propulsive velocity in terms of\nthe logarithm of the slenderness ratio. This approach allowed significant progress\nto be made without the requirement for a numerical solution of the SBT integral\nequation. The work on finite-amplitude swimming that followed appears to have\nbeen stimulated by Lighthill\u2019s simple and elegant theorem (Lighthill 1976). This result\nshowed that fluid velocity of a point on the flagellar surface near a centreline point\n\u03be (s0) can be represented as (i) a \u2018local\/Gray\u2013Hancock\u2019 contribution CNfN , due to\nnormal motion of the body and (ii) a \u2018non-local\u2019 contribution given by a line integral\nof Stokeslets greater than \u03b4: = a0\n\u221a\ne\/2 from s0, where a0 is the flagellum radius. It was\nassumed that variations in f (s) are small enough so that f (s) may be taken constant\nover the interval s0 \u2212 \u03b4 < s < s0 + \u03b4.\nFollowing this, Dresdner et al. (1980) considered a theory which extracted the local\nStokeslet\/dipole contributions due to both normal and tangential motions, allowing\nan iterative approach to solving for the unknown force distribution f (s) from an initial\nestimate obtained from RFT. The cell body was modelled as a sphere, using the well-\nknown representation of a Stokeslet\u2013dipole\u2013rotlet combination. The hydrodynamic\ninteractions of the head and tail, which occur due to the no-slip condition on the\nhead surface, were not taken into account, since in mammalian sperm the head\nis sufficiently small so that this approximation is relatively accurate, provided that\ninteractions with plane surfaces do not also occur. This approach was used extensively\n294 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C. Kirkman-Brown\nby Katz and co-workers in the 1980s to investigate the forces, torques and power\nconsumption associated with sperm in a variety of physiological situations (see for\nexample Dresdner & Katz 1981; Baltz, Katz & Cone 1988; Drobnis et al. 1988).\nMore recently Fulford et al. (1998) used the technique to investigate small-amplitude\nflagellar propulsion in a linear viscoelastic fluid. A similar approach adapted to\nStokes flow in the vicinity of a surface has been very successful for the modelling of\nwaveform emergence in cilia (Gueron & Liron 1992, 1993; Liron 2001) in the form\nof the Lighthill\u2013Gueron\u2013Liron (LGL) theorem. The efficiency of the technique has\nproved to be very useful for the modelling of the time-dependent problem of large\narrays of interacting cilia, beating due to the interaction of viscous forces and internal\nmechanics.\nA similar approach to SBT was developed by Johnson (1977), later developed to\ninclude higher order singularities (Johnson 1980). This was applied in Johnson &\nBrokaw (1979) to compare the forces calculated by SBT and RFT. This study proved\nthat RFT provides a good estimate for the force distribution for a headless flagellum\nin the absence of nearby surfaces, even for finite-amplitude motions, provided that\nad hoc increases are made to both resistance coefficients. The presence of a cell body\nhowever meant that a constant correction factor could not be used along the length\nof the flagellum.\nThe first application of the direct surface-velocity collocation numerical solution\ntechnique directly to SBT appears to be that of Liron & Mochon (1976), as reviewed\nin detail in Smith et al. (2007). The slender body was divided into segments, their size\nnot depending upon the radius or geometry of the body, with the force taken constant\non each segment. This discretization led to a matrix equation, with entries comprising\nStokeslet integrals, which may be solved directly for the forces. In this early paper\nthe near-field Stokeslet integrals were not computed precisely, instead being estimated\nfrom the \u2018midpoint\u2019 value of the Stokeslet on each discretization interval. Higdon\n(1979a ,b) used accurate, analytically determined Stokeslet and dipole integrals on\neach segment of the flagellum. An iterative solution approach was employed, but\ndirect solution may be employed equally well. There is a clear analogy between this\ntechnique and the boundary integral method for Stokes flow, and indeed Lighthill\n(1996b) explored in detail how the centreline Stokeslet distribution representation\ncan be derived from a surface Stokeslet distribution. Higdon (1979a, b) modelled\nfinite-amplitude flagellar motions in a way which is both accurate and, as we shall\nexploit in this study, testable post hoc.\nAll of the above works modelled the cell body or sperm head as a sphere, with\ncombinations of Stokeslets, potential dipoles, rotlets and, in certain cases, the image\nsingularities of Blake (1971) and Oseen (1927; see also Higdon 1979a) being used\nto represent the hydrodynamic effect of the head. The boundary integral method for\nStokes flow is a highly versatile technique, allowing the simulation of flows near,\nor driven by, arbitrary-shaped boundaries such as a non-spherical cell body and\na non-planar and non-spherical nearby surface. The technique was first applied by\nPhan-Thien, Tran-Cong & Ramia (1987) who used a double-layer formulation to\nmodel a spheroid cell body propelled by a helical tail. They benchmarked their code\nagainst the results of Higdon (1979b) and found excellent agreement.\nRamia, Tullock & Phan-Thien (1993) developed the technique further to simulate a\nthree-dimensional helical swimming micro-organism near a circular plate, developing\nefficient computational methods for solving the time-dependent tracking problem that\noccurs once the rotational symmetry of the problem is broken by the presence of\na boundary. They were able to show that helical swimming cells near a boundary\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 295\nhave a small propulsive advantage but dissipate more power. Their simulation results\nalso replicated the \u2018circling\u2019 of a rolling cell which occurs when swimming near a\nboundary through the use of their approximate tracking scheme. However they did\nnot address the question of boundary accumulation, and again their beat pattern and\ncell body proportions were closer to those observed in sea urchin sperm and bacteria\nthan mammalian sperm.\nAs discussed above, a number of studies have focused on helical swimming micro-\norganisms. This type of flagellar motility has rarely been reported for spermatozoa,\na notable exception being the images of Woolley & Vernon (2001), induced in sea\nurchin sperm at high viscosity.\nIshijima, Oshio & Mohri (1986) suggested that human sperm cells exhibit \u2018helicoid\u2019\nbeating, which takes the form of a helix modified by a conical envelope, the cross-\nsection of the cone being flattened from a circle to an ellipse with minor:major axis\nratio of 0.2. Either of these forms would provide a rotational component which\nwould explain the rolling observed in motile sperm. It should also be noted that\nWoolley (1977), investigating the three-dimensional nature of rodent sperm flagella,\nargued against the possibility of helical or helix-like beating, arguing instead for a\n\u2018twisted-planar-type\u2019 of beating in these species.\nOne can show using the torque-balance analysis proposed by Chwang & Wu (1971)\nthat sperm of most mammalian species cannot perform \u2018true\u2019 helical beating, with\ncircular cross-section, at a frequency sufficient to give observed swimming velocities,\nand indeed this was discussed by Gray: \u2018The propulsive powers of three-dimensional\nwaves are limited to the extent to which the organism is restrained by external forces\nfrom spinning about its own longitudinal axis\u2019 (Gray 1953). A difficulty with the\npioneering boundary integral study by Phan-Thien et al. (1987) was that the cell sizes\nused to model helically swimming bull sperm had larger volume than those of real\ncells. The internal control mechanism for the production of planar, helicoid and other\nforms of beating is an ongoing subject of enquiry (see for example Woolley & Vernon\n2001; Brokaw 2002).\n2.2. Computational fluid dynamics and fluid\u2013structure interaction\nIn addition to the above studies which used the Newtonian Stokes flow approximation,\nand which generally prescribe the form of the flagellar beat pattern, there has\nbeen growing interest in techniques that allow the modelling of more complex fluid\nproperties such as viscoelasticity; interaction between the fluid, the elastic structure\nof the flagellum, other nearby structures like boundaries or other cells; and the active\nmechanism of bending. The waveform hence becomes an emergent property of the\ncoupled \u2018fluid dynamics\u2013rheology\u2013structure\u2013internal mechanics\u2019 model. As reviewed\nabove, Fauci & McDonald (1995) pioneered this approach by applying the immersed\nboundary method to a two-dimensional model of sperm motility near a boundary and\nto two nearby sperm. More recent work has involved introducing a discrete viscoelastic\nstructure to the two-dimensional domain (Dillon et al. 2007) and combining the\nimmersed-boundary method with the regularized Stokeslet technique (Cortez 2001;\nCortez, Fauci & Medovikov 2005) for the modelling of three-dimensional beating.\n2.3. Sperm cell morphology and inter-\/intra-species heterogeneity\nHuman sperm cells exhibit heterogeneity of length, cell body (\u2018head\u2019) size and\nmorphology and motility characteristics. Typical ranges for sperm cell morphology\nand dimensions are given in Katz et al. (1986). In this study we shall take a \u2018standard\u2019\nhuman sperm to have flagellar length 56 \u03bcm, including an 11 \u03bcm midpiece, flagellar\nwidth 0.25 \u03bcm and head dimensions 4.5 \u00d7 2.8 \u00d7 1.1 \u03bcm. For the boundary element\n296 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C. Kirkman-Brown\nrepresentation of the sperm head used in this study, the non-dimensional volume is\n0.000037L3, where the length scale L=56 \u03bcm.\nFor human sperm, the head volume relative to the flagellar length is approximately\n50 times less than that of sperm of the sea urchin. Since the torque on a rotating body\nscales with the volume \u2013 as can be estimated from, for example, the rotlet strength\ndue to a rotating sphere (Higdon 1979b) \u2013 the torque on a rolling human sperm\nhead will be approximately 50 times smaller than that on a rolling sea urchin sperm\nhead. As discussed above, correctly determining the size of the head and hence the\ntorque for the species under consideration is vital in modelling sperm of a specific\nspecies.\n3. A hybrid boundary integral\/slender body model for sperm motility\n3.1. Fluid mechanics\nThe simplest framework for modelling micro-organism motility which takes into\naccount hydrodynamic interaction of the head and flagellum was that used by\nHigdon (1979a, b). The flagellum was represented by a line distribution of Stokeslets\nand potential dipoles, discretized into segments with constant strengths f q for\nq =1, . . . , Nt . The cell body or head was modelled as a sphere, represented by a\nStokeslet, a dipole and a rotlet, moving with velocity U and angular velocity \u03a9 . The\nno-slip condition on the cell body was satisfied by using Oseen\u2019s image system for a\npoint force (repeated in Higdon 1979a) near a spherical surface. The cell velocity and\nangular velocity, in addition to the flagellum force distribution, form a set of Nt + 2\nvector unknowns. Using the no-slip condition, the prescribed motion of the flagellum\nwith respect to the head at Nt collocation points was equated with the body frame\nfluid velocity field resulting from the unknown force distribution. The conditions of\nzero total force and torque were also applied, resulting in Nt + 2 vector equations.\nThe linear system was then solved iteratively to give the flagellar force distribution\nand cell translational and angular velocities.\nWe shall extend this framework to model human sperm which have non-spherical\nheads and generally accumulate near surfaces. A simple model which (a) includes\nthe drag and torque on a non-spherical head near a plane surface, (b) includes the\nhydrodynamic effect of a non-spherical head on the tail and (c) satisfies the no-slip\ncondition on the cell body and the plane surface is a boundary-integral representation\nof the head combined with a slender body representation of the tail. The latter is\ncapable of excellent accuracy and very high efficiency, the tail being represented\naccurately with just 30\u201360 vector degrees of freedom for the force per unit length, f q\nfor q =1, . . . , Nt . In contrast to the study of Ramia et al. (1993) the no-slip boundary\nis represented using the Stokeslet and image system for Stokes flow in a half-space\ngiven in Blake (1971) which we denote as SHS(x, y). This will be used in both the\nboundary integral representation of the head and the slender body representation of\nthe tail.\nWe shall use a single-layer boundary-integral representation for the head surface\n\u2202H , with traction \u03c6(Xh, t) for Xh \u2208 \u2202H . We use a slender body representation for\nthe tail, with force per unit length f (s, t), where s \u2208 [0, 1] is scaled arclength. The\nvelocity field for points in the fluid x outside of, or on, the surface of the sperm is\ngiven by\nu(x, t) =\n\u222b \u222b\n\u2202H\nS(x, Xh) \u00b7 \u03c6(Xh, t) dXh +\n\u222b 1\n0\nG(x, \u03be (s\u2217, t)) \u00b7 f (s\u2217, t) ds\u2217. (3.1)\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 297\nThe tensor S denotes the appropriate point-force singularity for the domain under\nconsideration, either an infinite fluid or a fluid in the half-space above a plane no-\nslip boundary x3 > 0. The tensor G denotes a force singularity and potential dipole\ncombination to improve the accuracy of the slender body representation. We discuss\nthe latter in more detail in \u00a7 3.4. To implement the single-layer boundary integral we\nuse the Fortran 77 programs given in the section prtcl 3d of BEMLIB, the software\nwhich accompanies Pozrikidis (2002). The geometry of the body is represented by\nquadratic triangles; the traction is discretized so that it takes a constant value \u03c6e\non each element \u2202He. A 32-element mesh of a sphere is shown in figure 3(a), as\nused in benchmarking results in \u00a7 3.5. A deformed spherical mesh, representing a\nhuman sperm head with length 4.5 \u03bcm, width 2.8 \u03bcm and \u2018thickness\u2019 1.1 \u03bcm is\nshown in figure 3(b, c). This mesh was produced by modifying an ellipsoid to give\nthe characteristic shape of a human sperm head \u2013 with a wide but \u2018sharp\u2019 front\nedge corresponding to the acrosome. Comparison with a refined 128-element mesh\nis given in \u00a7 3.4, and excellent agreement is found, so the 32-element mesh is used\nfor all simulation results. The slender body representation we use was described in\nSmith et al. (2007), which we briefly review in \u00a7 3.2. It involves discretizing the force\ndistribution as being piecewise constant, taking the value f q for (q \u22121)\/N < s <q\/N ,\nwhere q =1, . . . , Nt .\nThe point-force Stokeslet singularity for the i-component of the fluid velocity at x\nresulting from a unit point force acting in the j -direction, located at y is\nS\u221eij (x, y) =\n1\n8\u03c0\u03bc\n(\n\u03b4ij\nr\n+\nrirj\nr3\n)\n, (3.2)\nwhere ri = xi \u2212 yi and r2 = r21 + r22 + r23 ; the symbol \u03b4ij denotes the Kronecker tensor.\nNote that this differs from the definition in Higdon (1979a) and Pozrikidis (2002) in\nthe leading factor 1\/(8\u03c0\u03bc). The Stokeslet and image system of Blake (1971) near a\nno-slip surface x3 = 0 are\nSHSij (x, y) =\n1\n8\u03c0\u03bc\n([\n\u03b4ij\nr\n+\nrirj\nr3\n]\n\u2212\n[\n\u03b4ij\nR\n+\nRiRj\nR3\n]\n+2y3(\u03b4j\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b4j3\u03b43k) \u2202\n\u2202Rk\n[\ny3Ri\nR3\n\u2212\n[\n\u03b4i3\nR\n+\nRiR3\nR3\n]])\n. (3.3)\nThe image system is located at (y1, y2, \u2212y3), so that R1 = r1, R2 = r2, R3 = x3 + y3 and\nR2 =R21 +R\n2\n2 +R\n2\n3 . The summation convention is assumed, Latin indices taking values\n1, 2, 3 and the index \u03b1 taking values 1, 2 only. Finally, the infinite-domain potential\ndipole, also a solution of the Stokes flow equations, is\nKij (x, y) = \u2212 1\n4\u03c0\n\u2202\n\u2202rj\n[ ri\nr3\n]\n=\n1\n4\u03c0\n(\n\u2212\u03b4ij\nr3\n+ 3\nrirj\nr5\n)\n. (3.4)\nWe use the infinite-domain potential dipole in all cases, since it is a higher order\nsingularity than the Stokeslet, decaying as O(1\/r3) rather than O(1\/r). The error\nassociated with using this in the domain x3 > 0 is therefore negligible, provided that\nr3 \b y3.\nAs in the work of, for example, Higdon (1979b), Dresdner & Katz (1981) and\nRamia et al.

Hence by rigid body mechanics, with respect to the laboratory,\nthe kinematic velocities of points on the head vkin(Xh) and tail vkin(\u03be ) are respectively\nvkin(Xh) = U + \u03a9 \u2227 (Xh \u2212 X0),\nvkin(\u03be ) = U + \u03a9 \u2227 (\u03be \u2212 X0) + B \u00b7 \u03be\u02d9 \u2032, (3.6)\nthe final term being the velocity of the flagellum centreline with respect to the body\nframe, rotated into laboratory coordinates, and the dot in \u03be\u02d9\n\u2032\ndenoting time derivative.\nThe algorithm calculates the cell velocity U , angular velocity \u03a9 , tractions \u03c6e and\nforces per unit length f q , from the specification of the cell position X0, orientation\nB, flagellum position \u03be and flagellum velocity \u03be\u02d9 . In the equations that follow we shall\nequate surface and fluid velocities with respect to the laboratory frame. We impose\nthese conditions at Nh and Nt collocation points on the head and tail respectively\nand additionally apply force and torque balance over the head and tail.\nApplying vkin(Xh)= u(Xh) and vkin(X t )= u(X t ) to (3.1) we have\n0 =\n\u222b \u222b\n\u2202H\nS(Xh, Xh\u2217) \u00b7 \u03c6(Xh\u2217, t) dXh\u2217 +\n\u222b 1\n0\nG(Xh, \u03be (s\u2217, t)) \u00b7 f (s\u2217, t) ds\u2217\n\u2212 U \u2212 \u03a9 \u2227 (Xh \u2212 X0) for Xh \u2208 \u2202H , (3.7)\nB \u00b7 \u03be\u02d9 \u2032(s, t) =\n\u222b \u222b\n\u2202H\nS(X t\u03b8 (s, t), Xh\u2217) \u00b7 \u03c6(Xh\u2217, t) dXh\u2217\n+\n\u222b 1\n0\nG(X t\u03b8 (s\u2217, t), \u03be (s\u2217, t)) \u00b7 f (s\u2217, t) ds\u2217\n\u2212 U \u2212 \u03a9 \u2227 (\u03be (s, t) \u2212 X0) for 0 < s < 1.

The choice of the azimuthal angle \u03b8 which specifies these points is\nexplained in \u00a7 3.2. To close the system, the force balance equation is\n0 =\n\u222b \u222b\n\u2202H\n\u03c6(Xh\u2217, t) dXh\u2217 +\n\u222b 1\n0\nf (s\u2217, t) ds\u2217, (3.9)\n300 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R.

(3.10)\nEquations (3.7)\u2013(3.10) are discretized as described above; the boundary integrals\nare taken as described in Pozrikidis (2002) the slender body integrals are taken using\n12 point Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature for each sub-interval. We then assemble a matrix\nequation for 3Nh + 3Nt + 6 scalar variables. The boundary integral over an element\n\u2202He evaluated at a collocation point Xh \u2208 \u2202He will be large but finite. Likewise\nthe integral over a flagellum centreline segment Iq evaluated at a collocation point\nX t\u03b8q (sq, t) with sq \u2208 Iq will also be large but finite, although in this case the point\nof evaluation is displaced by a finite amount from the singularity location to the\nflagellum surface.\nIn zero-Reynolds-number flow, swimming behaviour is directly affected by flagellar\nkinematics and cell morphology only. Fluid viscosity \u03bc enters the problem only\nas a multiple of the forces and tractions and without loss of generality is taken\nto be unity throughout this study \u2013 see \u00a7 5 for elaboration of the implications of\nthis.\n3.2. Flagellar cross-sectional shape and the slender body collocation method\nIn order to form (3.8) we need to choose the surface collocation points X t\u03b8i (sq, t).\nWe define the vectors n\u02c6(s, t) and b\u02c6(s, t) to be the unit normal and binormal to the\nflagellum centreline at s. The t dependence is suppressed in this section. For a curved\nslender body with circular cross-section, the surface of the flagellum is given by\nX t\u03b8 (s)= \u03be (s) + a(s)n\u02c6(s) cos(\u03b8) + a(s)b\u02c6(s) sin(\u03b8) for 0<s < 1 and 0<\u03b8 < 2\u03c0, where a(s)\nis the radius at s.\nIf the function a(s) takes the constant value a0, the flagellar surface is a \u2018curved\ncylinder\u2019, whereas if a(s)= a0s(1 \u2212 s), then the flagellar surface is a \u2018curved ellipsoid\u2019,\nas discussed in Smith et al. (2007). Slender body theories since the work of Hancock\n(1953), including those of Higdon (1979a) and Dresdner et al. (1980), have typically\nused the \u2018curved cylinder\u2019 representation for the flagellum, which entails the use of the\npotential-dipole distribution \u2212(a20\/4\u03bc)Kjkf nk (s), where the normal component of the\nforce density is given by f n(s)= [ f (s)\u00b7n\u02c6(s)]n\u02c6(s). This correction reduces the magnitude\nof the \u2018azimuthal variation\u2019 in the velocity field on \u03be (s0)+a0n\u02c6(s0) cos(\u03b8)+a0 b\u02c6(s0) sin(\u03b8)\nfor fixed s0 as the azimuthal angle \u03b8 varies from 0 to 2\u03c0. A limitation of this\nrepresentation, as shown in Smith et al. (2007), is that the \u2018end errors\u2019 associated with\nthe slender body representation extend along a significant length of the flagellum.\nThe velocity field calculated on the surface of the curved cylinder exhibits spurious\nvariations between collocation points towards the ends of the body. Increasing the\nnumber of collocation points does not solve this problem but rather introduces\nspurious oscillations in the force distribution. Hence with this model, the choice of\nthe azimuthal position of the collocation points has a significant effect on both the\ncalculated force distribution f (s) and, when simulating cell migration, the trajectory\nof the cell.\nWe instead employ the \u2018curved ellipsoid\u2019 representation given in Smith et al. (2007),\nwhich was based on the work of Chwang & Wu (1975) and Johnson (1980) although\nimplemented differently. This representation reduces the spurious oscillations in the\ncalculated force distribution and the post hoc calculated fluid velocity between\ncollocation points. If the slender ellipsoid representing the flagellum has foci at\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 301\ns =0 and s =1, with singularities distributed between the foci, then the minor axis\nis a0; the major axis is\n\u221a\na20 + 1\/4; and the eccentricity e=1\/\n\u221a\n4a20 + 1. Noting the\nslightly different definitions of the Stokeslet and potentialdipole, equation (27a) of\nChwang & Wu (1975) suggests the following form for the slender body singularity\ndistribution:\nGjk(x, \u03be (s)) := Sjk(x, \u03be (s)) \u2212 a\n2\n0\n\u03bc\ns(1 \u2212 s)Kjk(x, \u03be (s)). (3.11)\nThis differs from the formula used in Smith et al. (2007), due to a change in the\ndefinition of Kjk , and also because the formula used in the previous study was\nincorrect for the focal length as given \u2013 however the difference contributed an error\nO(a40), which is negligible for the slenderness ratios considered.\nThe collocation points are then specified by the values \u03b8q for each X t\u03b8q (sq)= \u03be (sq) +\na(sq)n\u02c6(sq) cos(\u03b8q) + a(sq)b\u02c6(sq) sin(\u03b8q), where q =1, . . . , Nt , as shown in figure 2(b).\nWhen performing cell tracking, choosing \u03b8q =0 for all q , or choosing \u03b8q =\u03c0 for all\nq , introduces a small bias in the left and right directions respectively. Specifying\n\u2018alternating\u2019 collocation points so that \u03b82m =0 and \u03b82m+1 =\u03c0 for m=1, . . . , (N\nt \u2212 1)\/2\ngreatly reduces bias, producing a value for the cell movement that is intermediate\nbetween the results obtained by one-sided collocation.\n3.3. Computational code\nThe algorithms were programmed in Fortran 90, and additionally Fortran 77 programs\nfrom Pozrikidis (2002) were used. Computations were performed on the University of\nBirmingham Blue BEAR Opteron cluster, using a single core per simulation. It took\napproximately 5 hours of wall time to calculate 200 000 time steps, which generally\ncorresponded to 2000 flagellar beat cycles.\nTo verify the accuracy of the computer code, a number of tests were performed. The\nforce and torque balance algorithm for the slender body was verified by simulating\nthe falling rods problem of Russel et al. (1977). While a precise quantitative match\nto their trajectories was not expected due to the differing implementations of SBT,\na qualitative match to the behaviours of \u2018glancing\u2019, \u2018reversing\u2019 and \u2018colliding\u2019 was\nobtained for the same angles used in their study. The boundary integral code was\nverified by examining convergence of the far-field velocity due to a translating sphere\nnear a boundary with the stresslet far field given by Blake & Chwang (1974). The\nforce on a unit sphere translating near a surface was compared with the asymptotic\ntheory of O\u2019Neill & Stewartson (1967), giving agreement within 0.18% for separation\n0.1A and within 5.4% for separation of 0.05A, where A is the sphere radius. In\nthis study we only consider separation distances that are at least 30% of the head\nthickness, so the latter error would not occur. Additionally, calculations of the head\nand tail residuals were made, as described in \u00a7 3.6.\n3.4. Cell translation and rotation\nTracking cell movement entails calculating the position vector X0(tn+1) and orientation\nmatrix B(tn+1), from X0(tn) and B(tn) at the previous time step. The boundary\nintegral\/slender body algorithm uses X0(tn) and B(tn) together with the flagellar\nkinematic data at time tn to calculate the cell velocity Un := U(tn) and angular\nvelocity \u03a9n :=\u03a9(tn).\nWe calculate the new values of position and orientation, using a technique based on\nthe Heun second-order algorithm for the numerical solution of ordinary differential\n302 D.

We found that the cell translation distance agreed to within\n0.08%, confirming that the temporal discretization is not a significant source of\nerror.\nWe used the same test for the spatial discretization of the \u2018human\u2019 sperm head.\nComparing discretizations of 32 and 128 elements, achieved with the parameters\nndiv = 1 and ndiv = 2, we found that in the infinite domain the cell translation\nresult agreed within 0.04% and initially 0.2L above a no-slip surface within\n0.0025%, confirming that the spatial discretization used is not a significant source of\nerror.\n3.5. Swimming in an infinite domain: comparison with the results\nof Dresdner & Katz (1981)\nWe first present results for comparison with those of Dresdner & Katz (1981), for\ntheir \u2018activated human sperm\u2019 beating model, as depicted in figure 4 and described in\n\u00a7A.2. Their results were calculated using the model given in Dresdner et al. (1980),\nwhich used the Hancock (1953) SBT, modified to be more efficient using the theorem\nof Lighthill (1975). The essence of Lighthill\u2019s theorem is that near-field singularity\ncontributions are integrated to give an RFT-type term, while far-field potential-dipole\nterms are neglected, leaving only far-field Stokeslet integrals. The collocation issues\ndiscussed above are circumvented by evaluating the fluid velocity on the centreline\nrather than the flagellum surface.\nIn this study we shall not make these simplifications but rather solve the problem\nusing surface-velocity collocation directly. For comparison with the results of Dresdner\n& Katz (1981), in this section we use the tail length scale of 45 \u03bcm, the beat frequency\n14 Hz and a spherical head of radius 1.25 \u03bcm with the fluid assumed to be infinite.\nThe flagellum was represented by Nt =60 degrees of freedom.\nWe find that using the \u2018curved ellipsoid\u2019 representation for the tail, with maximum\nradius (0.25\/45)L, over one beat period, the point X0 translates from (0, 0, 0) to\n(\u22120.0564L, 0.0297L, 0.0000L). The cell positions at the beginning, middle and end of\na beat cycle are shown in figure 5. The calculated cell velocity is therefore 40.2 \u03bcm s\u22121.\nThis compares with the larger value of 43 \u03bcm s\u22121 given by Dresdner & Katz (1981).\nThe calculated velocity for our model is not heavily dependent on the choice of\ncollocation points.\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 303\n\u20130.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u20130.4\n\u20130.2\n0\n0.2\nx\/L\ny\/\nL\nFigure 5. Sperm locations and flagellum shapes at the beginning, middle and end of one beat\ncycle. The cell \u2018yaws\u2019 to one side and then returns having progressed forward slightly. The\nsimulation was performed with the \u2018activated\u2019 beating model of Dresdner & Katz (1981) and\nthe \u2018human\u2019 sperm head mesh.\nFor the cylindrical representation, varying the position of the collocation points\nfrom \u03b8q =0 to \u03b8q =\u03c0 for all q results in a change in the prediction of swimming\nspeed of 19%. With a Stokeslet-only representation, the variation being 67% is even\nmore unacceptably large. For the ellipsoidal representation, the change in prediction\nof swimming speed with change in choice of collocation points is 1.4%, showing\nthat the ellipsoidal representation with associated dipole singularities is preferable\nfor robust cell tracking with the surface-velocity collocation approach. The main\ndifferences between our present approach and the work of Dresdner & Katz (1981)\nare (a) that the no-slip condition is now satisfied accurately on the sperm head and\n(b) that the tail forces are calculated directly by surface-velocity collocation, rather\nthan by the iterative scheme described in Dresdner et al. (1980), allowing for greater\nrefinement in the discretization of the force distribution. In the remainder of the\npaper we make the additional refinement of considering a physiologically shaped\nsperm head.\n3.6. Numerical residuals\nTo verify a posteriori the accuracy of each time step, we calculate the fluid velocity at\npoints on the surface of the head and flagellum and compare them to, respectively,\nU + \u03a9 \u2227 (Xh \u2212 X0) and U + \u03a9 \u2227 (X t \u2212 X0) + \u03be\u02d9 , as discussed in Smith et al. (2007).\nTo quantify the accuracy on the head, we employ a scaled residual measure on each\nelement e, denoted re. The residual is given by the difference between the \u2018kinematic\nboundary velocity\u2019 vkin(Xh)= U +\u03a9 \u2227 (Xh \u2212 X0) of the point Xh and the fluid velocity\ncalculated from (3.1) with x = Xh. The element residual function is then scaled with\nrespect to the maximum surface velocity on the element:\nre(Xh)=\n|vkin(Xh) \u2212 u(Xh)|\nmaxx\u2208\u2202He |vkin(x)| . (3.13)\nThe element is parametrized as in Pozrikidis (2002) as 0<\u03be < 1 and 0<\u03b7<\u03be . In\nwhat follows we use (x, y, z) coordinates instead of index notation (x1, x2, x3), and the\nplane surface will be at z=0. Figure 6 shows the residual on various representative\nelements of the head mesh, for example, near the head\/flagellum junction X0 and\nat the front of the cell where the highest curvatures occur. Additionally, figure 6(f)\nshows the residual on element 21, which is one of the 4 elements adjacent to the\nno-slip boundary. The scaled residual on element 21 is less than 3% for Z0\u0002 0.020L,\nbut for Z0 = 0.015L the error reaches 6%.\n304 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C.

Simulation study results\nIn the following sections, we use the hybrid boundary integral\/slender body model\nto investigate aspects of cell migration: the effect of head geometry and a nearby no-\nslip boundary on cell progression, the surface accumulation phenomenon for planar\nbeating cells and finally the surface accumulation phenomenon for three-dimensional\nbeating cells.\n4.1. The effect of head geometry and surface proximity on cell progression\nIt may be speculated that the flattened shape of the human sperm head allows for\nmore rapid progression through liquid. We simulated progression of cells over one\nbeat cycle, which have the same volume but are either spherical or \u2018physiological\u2019\nshape. The physiological head allows more rapid movement for a given beat pattern,\nby a factor of 2.8%. The spatial convergence test for the head mesh discussed in \u00a7 3.4\ndemonstrates that this difference is not a numerical artefact. Analysing the resistance\nmatrix using the BEMLIB routine prtcl3d shows that the resistance to forward\nmotion of the physiological head is actually 2% more than the spherical head, due\nto the fact that its surface area is 30% greater. The resistance to rotation of the\nphysiological head about the body frame z-axis is more than doubled compared with\nthe spherical head, which has the effect of decreasing yawing of the head, resulting in\nincreased overall forward progression.\nThe proximity of the no-slip surface has a negligible effect of less than 0.003%\non progression at a distance of 2.0L, but at a distance of 0.2L, equivalent to\napproximately 12 \u03bcm, the boundary results in approximately a 3.6% increase in\nswimming velocity compared with swimming in an infinite fluid for the \u2018human\u2019\nmesh. Very similar results are observed with the ellipsoid representation for differing\nchoices of collocation points.\n4.2. \u2018Finite distance\u2019 surface accumulation of a planar beating cell\nThe simulation model was used to simulate swimming of a cell initially parallel to,\nand at height Z0 = 1.0L above, the plane boundary z=0. The beat pattern used\nwas again that given by Dresdner & Katz (1981), with a range of values for the\nwavenumber k. Figure 9 shows the trajectories of cells with k=2\u03c0, 3\u03c0 and 4\u03c0. For\nk=2\u03c0, the parameter used by Dresdner & Katz (1981) to simulate \u2018activated human\nsperm\u2019 swimming in semen, the cell turns away from the surface and escapes. For\nk=3\u03c0 and k=4\u03c0, the cell behaves differently: it turns towards the surface and then\naway, performing a series of oscillations which converge to a stable swimming height\nabove the surface. Convergence happens more quickly for k=4\u03c0, with the stable\nswimming height being reached in approximately 80 body lengths.\nFigure 10(a) shows the effect of wavenumbers from k=\u03c0 to k=4\u03c0 on surface\naccumulation behaviour. For k\u0003 2\u03c0, the cell is predicted to escape. For k=2.1\u03c0,\n2.2\u03c0, simulation results are inconclusive: over a period of 400 000 time steps the cell\nexhibits oscillations which grow in size. It appears likely that the cell would escape, but\nit is not possible to demonstrate this conclusively. For k=2.3\u03c0, 2.4\u03c0 the cell exhibits\nconverging oscillations, but a converged trajectory and hence stable value of Z0 was\nnot obtained in the simulation period of 400 000 time steps. For k\u0002 2.5\u03c0 the cell is\npredicted to converge to a constant height Z0 that falls as k is increased. For a cell with\nk=3\u03c0 the accumulation height would be Z0 = 0.31L, corresponding to approximately\n17 \u03bcm for a human sperm cell. In the stable trajectory, the cell is found to be slightly\ntilted away from the surface. Figure 10(b) shows the effect of wavenumber on this\nangle.

We also tested cells\nwith k=2\u03c0 and k=4\u03c0 and obtained similar results to the planar case \u2013 respectively\nescape and accumulation (results not shown). Setting \u03b13 = 0 so that the beat pattern\nis planar, the surface accumulation behaviour still occurs. Swimming is not as rapid\nin the rolling case, since rolling of the cell reduces the apparent wave speed in the\nlaboratory frame \u2013 as discussed by Gray (1953) and Chwang & Wu (1971).\n4.4. \u2018Elliptical helicoid\u2019 beating and head movement\nThe present modelling framework allows the prediction of cell rolling behaviour\nresulting from specifications of the flagellar beat, taking into account the important\neffect of the head geometry, which influences the force and torque balance on the\ncell. Figure 12 shows (a) a montage of cell positions at every half beat cycle and\n(b) the head positions at the beginning, middle and end of a beat cycle. Viewed\nfrom the front, the head rolls clockwise to counterbalance the torque exerted by\nthe anticlockwise-rotating flagellum. The head rolls in synchrony with the plane of\nflattening of the flagellar beat due to the way the flagellar beat is specified, consistent\nwith the observations of Ishijima et al. (1992) and the fact that the flagellum does\nnot rotate with respect to the head in eukaryotic cells, in contrast to bacteria. The\ntrajectory of the point X0 is shown in figure 12(c). This shows that the rate of\nrolling of the cell is not constant, as was the case for a cell with a pure helical beat\nas considered by Higdon (1979b). The non-constant rolling rate occurs because the\nnon-planar component of the beat that generates the roll grows in amplitude as it\npropagates along the tail. The result is two \u2018loops\u2019 per beat cycle, and this simple model\nof three-dimensional movement produces qualitative similarities with the observations\nof Woolley (2003) of the \u2018flagelloid curve\u2019 trajectory of a cell swimming against a\ncoverslip, as shown in figure 12(d, e).\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 309\n(a)\n(b)\n(d)\n(c)\n\u20130.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\ny\/\nL\nz\/\nL\nz\/\nL\n(e)\n(f)\nz\/\nL\nz\/\nL\n\u20130.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\nx\/L\nx\/L\n\u20130.200.2\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\ny\/L\nz\/\nL\n\u20137 \u20136 \u20135 \u20134 \u20133 \u20132 \u20131 0 1\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nx\/L\n\u2013160 \u2013140 \u2013120 \u2013100 \u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0\n0\n0.5\n1.0\nR\/L\n\u2013160 \u2013140 \u2013120 \u2013100 \u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0\nR\/L\nRolling (\u03b13\/\u03b12 = 0.2)\n0\n0.5\n1.0 Planar (\u03b13 = 0)\nFigure 11. \u2018Elliptical helicoid\u2019 flagellar beat pattern, with amplitude parameter \u03b12 = 0.2,\nminor:major axis ratio \u03b13\/\u03b12 = 0.2 and wavenumber k=3\u03c0.

While the current modelling framework does not allow the simulation of\neither the head or flagellum being in very close proximity to z=0, it is possible to\ntest whether the initial stage of such a trajectory may occur. Figure 13(e) shows the\nalignment of such a cell against a surface for initial angle of inclination of 18\u25e6.\nThe second model, based on observations of mouse sperm, holds that if there is a\nsmall angle of inclination between the beat plane and the plane of flattening of the\nhead, a cell may \u2018glide\u2019 along a surface, with the propulsive force of the flagellum\npushing the head towards the surface. This could result in the cell moving forward\nwhile remaining a very small distance from z=0. We tested whether this model could\napply to human sperm, by combining the human sperm head mesh with the Dresdner\n& Katz (1981) planar beat, with k=3\u03c0. Example results are shown in figure 14 for\nan inclination angle of 10\u25e6 and initial height Z0 = 0.05L. The cell quickly lifts off\nthe surface and escapes. We tested angles of up to 12\u25e6 and found that the same\nphenomenon occurs. Even for initial angle of inclination of 0\u25e6, a cell starting at this\nheight is still deflected away sufficiently to escape. We repeated the simulations for\nZ0 initially 0.03L and obtained similar results. Simulating a cell initially closer to the\nsurface is not possible within the current framework.\n5. Discussion\nWe studied the fluid mechanics of human sperm swimming in a Newtonian viscous\nfluid near a no-slip planar boundary, in order to explain and interpret the observations\nof Rothschild (1963), Winet et al. (1984) and Woolley (2003). We formulated a hybrid\nboundary integral\/slender body model of a human sperm, with physiological head\nsize and proportions. We investigated four possible beat patterns: the planar \u2018activated\nhuman\u2019 model proposed by Dresdner & Katz (1981), a simple model of an \u2018elliptical\nhelicoid\u2019 flagellar beat, the corresponding planar degenerate case and finally the\n\u2018activated human\u2019 beat pattern combined with a tilt angle between head and beat\nplane.\nOur simulation results predict that a planar beating model of human sperm\ncell initially one body length away from and oriented parallel to a surface, with\nsufficiently large wavenumber, is \u2018steered\u2019 by the surface to an equilibrium trajectory,\nresulting in surface accumulation. The simulations suggest that the critical value of\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 313\nthe wavenumber is approximately 2.2\u03c0, although simulation results were inconclusive\nin the range 2.0\u03c0\u20132.4\u03c0. The cell initially performs an oscillatory motion with decaying\namplitude, which continues with the cell converging on an equilibrium height at which\nit swims in a stable manner a small angle of inclination away from the surface. The\noscillations occur over relatively long distances, typically tens of body lengths, and\nas such would occur over observation periods of tens of seconds. For a cell with\nwavenumber k=3\u03c0 we predict that the equilibrium height is approximately 17 \u03bcm.\nThe equilibrium height is reduced as the wavenumber is increased, so that a cell\nswimming with a wavenumber of k=4\u03c0 is predicted to swim at approximately 8.5 \u03bcm\nfrom the surface, although the scaling is not linear. These results are consistent with\nthe observations of Winet et al. (1984) who reported the highest cell concentrations at\n10\u201320 \u03bcm from the surface. Stable swimming occurs with a small angle of inclination\naway from the surface of less than 0.5\u25e6. The equilibrium inclination angle varies\nwith wavenumber and decays rapidly approaching the minimal values of k for which\naccumulation occurs.\nCells swimming with lower wavenumbers are predicted to escape from the surface.\nThe mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, but we note that the extrapolated\ninclination angle for cells at the minimal values of k for which accumulation occurs\nis approximately zero, suggesting that the stable swimming configuration degenerates\nbelow such values of k.\n\u2018Finite distance\u2019 surface trapping does not require specialized beating with\nnon-planar components to push the cell towards the surface. Additionally, cells\nexhibiting rolling motility due to elliptical helicoid beating, as has been inferred\nfrom observations of human sperm, exhibited similar accumulation behaviour. The\naccumulation phenomenon was found to depend on initial angle of inclination. If\na cell approaches a surface from a distance of one body length and with a 4\u25e6\u20136\u25e6\nangle of inclination, the cell will be deflected. Similar results were predicted for a\nplanar beating cell. We also found that rolling cells exhibited similar dependence on\nwavenumber, with k=2\u03c0 and k=4\u03c0 producing escape and accumulation respectively.\nSuch surface trapping is a relatively weak effect, which may be consistent with\nthe observations of Winet et al. (1984) and Rothschild (1963) that cells are found\nin a \u2018distribution\u2019 of swimming heights rather than concentrated exclusively near\nthe surface. Variations in wavenumber between cells will lead to variations in\nstable accumulation height, which may also be an important factor in producing\na distribution of heights. For larger angles of inclination, collision with the surface\nis predicted to occur, and further simulation within the present framework is not\npossible. The principle difficulties are that the residuals on the head are unacceptably\nlarge as it approaches the surface, and the slender body theory model additionally will\nbreak down as the condition r3 \b y3 is violated. Nevertheless, our simulations suggest\nthat cells approaching with sufficiently steep angle may align with the \u2018swept conical\nenvelope\u2019 aligned against the surface, as suggested by Woolley (2003) for chinchilla\nsperm.\nWe also investigated the possibility of cells with a small angle of inclination between\nthe head plane of flattening and the beat plane, \u2018gliding\u2019 along a surface at a small\ndistance, as reported in mouse sperm, within the context of the human sperm model.\nSimulations with initial height of 0.03L\u20130.05L, equivalent to approximately 1.5\u20133 \u03bcm,\npredicted that such cells were not able to glide in this manner, and indeed cells initially\nclose to a surface will turn away and escape, with or without there being inclination\nbetween the head and beat plane. Further clarification of the fluid dynamics of such\ngliding motion is necessary, and it is possible that features of the head geometry or\n314 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C. Kirkman-Brown\nsubtle aspects of the flagellar beat in species such as the mouse may explain how\nstable swimming can occur with the head in close proximity to the surface. As noted\nby Woolley (2003), it is also likely that near the surface the flagellar beat would\nbe modified, which may prevent collision. It may also be that case that trapping\noccurs after cells collide with the surface, which we cannot simulate with the present\nframework.\nSwimming at finite height so that the cell is not in contact with the surface,\nbut rather is guided to follow it, may have implications for cell function in certain\nphysiological situations. The variation in wavenumber that occurs with changes in\nviscosity may hence also have an important effect on the swimming height of cells,\nwhich may be relevant considering the effect of in vivo variations in viscosity along\nthe female reproductive tract and during the menstrual cycle.\nThe simulation model was also used to test the cell rolling and head trajectory\nthat would occur due to elliptical helicoid beating. The head is predicted to roll by\napproximately 240\u25e6 during one beat cycle and traces out a path which appears as\nconsisting of three \u2018loops\u2019 viewed from the front, much like that observed in the\nslightly different situation of cells swimming against a coverslip by Woolley (2003).\nElliptical helicoid beating with a conical envelope results in a non-constant torque\nexerted by the flagellum on the fluid during the flagellar beat. The flagellar torque,\nwhich must be balanced by rolling of the entire cell, has two maxima during each\nflagellar beat cycle, which causes two periods of high rolling rate, resulting in the\n\u2018loops\u2019 observed.\nIn a Newtonian model of flagellar propulsion with prescribed beat pattern and\nfrequency, viscosity does not have any effect on the swimming behaviour predicted.\nIt is known from experiments (see for example Ishijima et al. 1986) that viscosity\nhas important effects on beat pattern and frequency; therefore theoretical predictions\nregarding swimming velocity and trajectory in different viscosity liquids must either\nmake use of beat pattern and frequency parameters that are appropriate to the liquid\nin question or alternatively model the internal mechanics of the flagellum and the\nfluid-structure interaction that modifies the flagellum movement (see for example\nDillon et al. 2007).\nOur model does not include the effect of Brownian motion. For sperm cells, which\nhave length of approximately 50 \u03bcm, neither translational nor rotational Brownian\nmotion appears to be important in experiments (unpublished observations). However\nfor Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a bacterium with a micron-sized body and a flagellum\nof less than 10 \u03bcm, Brownian fluctuations appear to govern cell reorientation during\nthe intermittent stops of its flagellum (Armitage & Macnab 1987). This suggests\nthat rotational Brownian motion may significantly perturb such small cells, which in\nturn may destabilize the swimming trajectory if the sensitivity to angle of inclination\nobserved here is inherited by the helical flagellar motility of bacteria.\nSurface accumulation of sperm is, as indicated by Woolley (2003), a complex\nphenomenon which depends on flagellar beat pattern and possibly aspects of head\ngeometry. Our findings are summarized below.\n(i) We predict that planar beating human sperm cells with planar waveform and\nwavenumber k=3\u03c0 perform \u2018finite distance\u2019 surface accumulation; that is they swim\nstably at a distance of approximately 17 \u03bcm from a surface, with approximately 0.4\u25e6\ninclination towards the surface.\n(ii) Specialized non-planar components of the beat pattern are not necessary for\nthis accumulation to occur, although cells performing non-planar \u2018elliptical helicoid\u2019\nflagellar beating behave similarly.\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 315\n(iii) The attraction effect is relatively weak, so that cells initially one body length\naway from the surface and with angle of inclination of up to 2\u25e6 towards the surface\nwill be trapped; however cells swimming with steeper angles of inclination will be\ndeflected or will approach so closely that simulation will no longer be possible.\n(iv) The flagellar wavenumber has a significant effect on the rate of convergence\nof the trajectory and the eventual stable swimming height, with an increase from\nk=3\u03c0 to k=4\u03c0 resulting in an approximate halving of the stable swimming height,\nalthough the relationship is not linear.\n(v) Sperm performing rolling motility with conical flagellar envelope and sufficient\nangle of attack towards the surface may align in the manner reported in chinchilla\nsperm.\n(vi) We predict that human sperm would not be able to perform the \u2018hydrofoil\u2019\nsurface accumulation reported in mouse sperm for separation distances of 0.03\u20130.05\nbody lengths. Consideration of subtle features of the head and flagellum may be\nrequired to explain the effect in murine cells.\n6. Future work\nThe hybrid boundary integral\/slender body model we have presented has provided\ninsight into the fluid mechanics of cell accumulation at and near surfaces. The model\nhas great potential for the exploration of other aspects of sperm motility, for example\nthe accurate calculation of forces and hence bending moments on the flagellum and\ntheir variation due to beat pattern. The model may be adapted to investigate other\ncell types including the sperm of other species, bacteria and a great many types\nof cells which use flagella for motility or feeding (see for example Orme, Blake &\nOtto 2001). The hybrid boundary integral\/slender body framework further may be\ninvaluable in the modelling of systems in which flagella and cilia beat near non-planar\nboundaries, for example the nodal cavity of the embryo (Smith et al. 2007; Smith,\nBlake & Gaffney 2008).\nAt present we have only simulated one isolated cell near a surface. As discussed in\nLighthill (1996a), the velocity field around a free-swimming cell decays as a stresslet,\nwith O(1\/r2). In the presence of a surface, which will induce a leading-order image\nstresslet, this will become O(1\/r3), implying that the hydrodynamic effect of a motile\ncell close to a surface is relatively short-range. Nevertheless, in both the early stages\nof in vivo migration and in laboratory tests, cells will occur in high concentrations \u2013\nfor example in a wet preparation of undiluted semen, cells will be at such high\nconcentrations that apparent collisions and crossing of paths will occur frequently,\nand in such situations hydrodynamic interactions will be important. Simulation of\nmultiple cells using the algorithm described in this paper would involve the solution\nat each time step of linear problems with N =3(Nh+Nt +2)Ncells degrees of freedom.\nFor a single cell, the matrix set-up and solution are approximately equally expensive.\nHowever, the cost of matrix set-up is proportional to N2, whereas solving linear\nproblems directly is proportional to N3, and so the use of efficient parallelized\niterative solvers may become necessary. However, the O(1\/r3) screening effect would\nmean that relatively few cells would have to be simulated in order to give insight\ninto the likely behaviour of a single cell in a highly concentrated suspension. It is\nalso likely that simplified models which preserve the essential propulsive\/drag effect\nof each cell, the slender body nature of the flagellum and the image systems in the\nboundary may give useful insight into the fundamental mechanics of the accumulation\neffect on individual and multiple cells.\n316 D. J. Smith, E. A. Gaffney, J. R. Blake and J. C. Kirkman-Brown\nAt present, we are working to quantify the three-dimensional beat pattern of\nhuman sperm in the presence of a nearby surface. As indicated by Woolley (2003), it\nis likely that the presence of the surface may suppress the three-dimensional nature\nof the beat to some extent. As such data become available for human sperm, this\nmodel will be used to understand the fluid mechanics of the resulting cell motion.\nThe swimming of sperm in viscoelastic liquids was considered in the initial study of\nFulford et al. (1998) on the effect of elasticity, subject to the assumption of small-\namplitude beating. Cervical mucus has been shown to be viscoelastic (Wolf et al.\n1977), and extension of the slender body modelling technique to investigate linear\nviscoelastic effects with finite amplitude beating will also be a subject for future\nwork.\nDJS acknowledges the MRC for a training fellowship in computational biology\nand the Wellcome Trust for a \u2018Value in People\u2019 fellowship.

The flagellar beat pattern\nA.1. Mathematical framework\nWe discuss below the mathematical details of the specification of the flagellar beat\ncycle. In Dresdner & Katz (1981), the flagellum is defined by a curve\n\u03be \u2032\u20322 = y(\u03be\n\u2032\u2032\n1 , t)\n(\n0 < \u03be \u2032\u20321 < \u03be\nmax\n1\n)\n, (A1)\nwhere \u03bemax1 is determined by specifying a constant total flagellar arclength. The curve\n\u03be \u2032\u2032(\u03be \u2032\u20321 )= (\u03be \u2032\u20321 , \u03be \u2032\u20322 , 0) defines a planar wave. This must then be translated and rotated\nto give the body frame position vector \u03be \u2032(\u03be \u20321)= (\u03be \u20321, \u03be \u20322, 0), which satisfies (a) \u03be\n\u2032(0)= 0\nand (b) that the tangent to \u03be \u2032 at \u03be \u20321 = 0 is (1, 0, 0). This corresponds to the flagellum\njoining the head at the body frame origin, the flagellum being tangential to the head\ncentreline, as shown in figure 2(a). As described in the text, the laboratory frame\nposition vector of the flagellum is given by \u03be = X0 + B \u00b7 \u03be \u2032.\nIn order to discretize the flagellum into collocation points at arclengths sq =(q \u2212\n0.5)\/Nt (q =1, . . . , Nt ) we follow Dresdner & Katz (1981) and consider the arclength\nfunction\ns(\u03be \u2032\u20321 , t) =\n\u222b \u03be \u2032\u20321\n0\n(\n1 +\n[\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n(x, t)\n]2)1\/2\ndx. (A2)\nWe invert this function by Newton\u2019s method to calculate the position vectors of the\ncollocation points \u03be \u2032\u2032(sq, t), corresponding to fixed arclength values. Additionally we\ndistribute quadrature nodes equally along each sub-interval of the flagellum. Since\nthe flagellar patterns considered are periodic, the calculation is carried out for one\nbeat cycle, with t =0, \u03b4t, . . . , T .\nHuman sperm accumulation near surfaces 317\nA.2. Flagellar waveform of Dresdner & Katz (1981) with variable wavenumber\nFor planar beating sperm of various species and in various activation states, Dresdner\n& Katz (1981) used the general parametrization\n\u03be \u2032\u20322 = b(\u03be\n\u2032\u2032\n1 ) sin\n(\n2\u03c0\n[\n\u03be \u2032\u20321\n\u03bb(\u03be \u2032\u20321 )\n\u2212 f t\n])\n. (A3)\nFor human sperm in semen, the amplitude and wavelength were chosen as\nb(\u03be \u2032\u20321 )= 0.1087\u03be \u2032\u20321 + 0.0543 and \u03bb(\u03be \u2032\u20321 )= 1. In this paper we used the following form:\n\u03be \u2032\u20322 = b(\u03be\n\u2032\u2032\n1 ) sin(k\u03be\n\u2032\u2032\n1 \u2212 t), (A4)\nwhere \u03be \u2032\u20321 , \u03be \u2032\u20322 are non-dimensional coordinates, scaled with respect to flagellar length;\nk is angular wavenumber scaled with respect to the inverse of flagellar length; and\nt is non-dimensional time, scaled so that t =2\u03c0 represents one beat cycle. For the\noriginal parameterization of Dresdner & Katz (1981), k=2\u03c0, although in this study\nwe examined values of k from \u03c0 to 4\u03c0. We calculate the velocity components of the\nflagellum collocation points slightly differently from Dresdner & Katz (1981): we use\nnumerical centred differences to take the time derivatives of the points \u03be \u2032(sq, t).\nA.3. Elementary models of elliptical helicoid and planar sinusoid beating\nRikmenspoel (1965) and Ishijima et al. (1986, 1992) argued respectively that bull and\nhuman sperm exhibit an \u2018elliptical helicoid\u2019 beat pattern, that is a beat pattern which\nis a left-handed helix with elliptical cross-section. For human sperm, the major:minor\naxis ratio was given by Ishijima et al. (1986) as 5 : 1. We formulate an elementary\nmodel of this as follows:\n\u03be \u20322 = \u03b12\u03be\n\u2032\n1 cos(k\u03be\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 t), \u03be \u20323 = \u2212\u03b13\u03be \u20321 sin(k\u03be \u20321 \u2212 t), (A5)\nwhere the amplitude parameters are chosen so that \u03b13\/\u03b12 = 0.2, and we have non-\ndimensionalized \u03be \u2032i and t as above. This beat pattern will cause cell rolling, as generally\nobserved in motile human sperm in low viscosity medium, which occurs because of\nthe torques associated with the rotating helicoid. We also formulate a corresponding\nplanar beat pattern by simply setting \u03b13 = 0.\nREFERENCES\nArmitage, J. P. & Macnab, R.
