Scenarios are\nchallenging descriptions of futures that are relevant to a\nstrategic decision and representative of plausible develop-\nments in the external world (De Geus, 1988; Van der\nHeijden, 1996). They are an invaluable tool for managers\nor strategists who want to think through the future\ndimension of decisions and actions. When combined with\noption planning (where all options are put forward on a\nneutral mode) and a clear, structured view of what is\ndesirable, scenarios provide a coherent framework for\nevaluating strategic options (Wack, 1985a, b). They may\nalso emphasise the importance of developing strategic\noptions so that the final choice is robust (ie capable of\nresponding to a variety of changes in uncontrollable\nfactors) (Roy, 1998, 2010; Pomerol, 2001).\nThe literature has proposed several ways of integrating\nscenarios with a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)\nframework (Phillips, 1986; Stewart, 1997, 2005; Wright and\nGoodwin, 1999; Goodwin and Wright, 2001; Belton and\nStewart, 2002; Montibeller et al, 2006). The integrated\nmethodology provides a range of contexts within which to\nsystematically consider the implications of trade-offs\namong multiple objectives. However, there is scope for\nfurther development of the methodology with respect to\ndeveloping scenarios that reflect a larger number of wide-\nranging scenarios in a time-efficient manner (Klayman\nand Schoemaker, 1993; Godet and Roubelat, 1996), and\nMCDA measures that inform within and across scenario\ncomparison of options (Durbach and Stewart, 2003). This\npaper explores the former by suggesting a method for\ndeveloping scenarios using a combinatorial set of key\nuncertainties, each of which may take a small number of\ndifferent levels. It addresses the latter by proposing the\nuse of cost-equivalent regret (Keeney, 1992; Lempert et al,\n2006). The benefits and drawbacks of applying these in\npractice will be investigated through a case study involving\nfood security in Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe paper is organised into three parts. First, the case\nfor the proposed method in light of existing techniques is\nelaborated. This is followed by a practical illustration of\nthe method using food security in Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe paper then concludes with a discussion of findings and\nscope for further development of the method.\nApplications of SP to the evaluation of strategic options\nScenarios can be used to help the decision maker develop a\nbetter understanding of the complex relationships among\nuncertainties, objectives and strategic options, which are\nJournal of the Operational Research Society (2011) 62, 817\u2013829 \u00a9 2011 Operational Research Society Ltd.

They can direct attention to critical issues\nand uncertainties, and help define strategic priorities when\nmultiple objectives exist. Scenarios also provide a platform\nfor creating, testing and refining strategic options. To this\nend, they may highlight potential strengths and weaknesses\nof options, or provide insights on how to increase the\nrobustness of options.\nThe multiple uses of scenarios imply that evaluation\ntechniques that seek to integrate them should be capable of:\nK Incorporating subjective judgments and dealing with\nmultiple, conflicting objectives\u2014Scenarios are a combina-\ntion of analysis and judgment about future possibilities\n(Schoemaker, 1991). An evaluation technique should\ntherefore reflect this, while taking into account the\nexistence of multiple preferences. The literature supports\nthe use of quantitative analysis of how scenarios\nperform under a set of pre-defined strategic options\n(Leemhuis, 1985; Huss and Honton, 1987; Godet and\nRoubelat, 1996; Morgan et al, 1999; Wollenberg et al,\n2000; Chermack, 2004; Stewart, 2005) over flexible\nqualitative descriptions (eg Likert scales).\nK Achieving a diverse set of scenario themes quickly\u2014\nRobustness implies that it is meaningful to consider\nscenarios that cover a diversity of possibilities. The\nscenario narrative is typically developed by developing\nstorylines of how the future might unfold from the\npresent to four end states defined by the upper and\nlower bounds of two key uncertainties (Schwartz and\nOgilvy, 1998). Development of the narrative is itself\ntime-consuming, which is a disadvantage when this is\nonly one constituent of the evaluation process.\nK Within and across scenario comparison\u2014In order to\nprovide insights for the development and selection of a\nrobust option, a scale that allows comparison must be\ndeveloped, accompanied by informative visual displays.\nMCDA and SP for the evaluation of strategic options\nThe combined use of MCDA and SP provides a range of\nadvantages with respect to the above implications. Firstly,\nMCDA is well-equipped to deal with objectives that are\ndifficult to quantify, conflicting and hard to compare.\nScenarios provide a framework for confronting uncer-\ntainty, which MCDA lacks. Secondly, it may provide a\ngood balance between the analytic and intuitive compo-\nnents of decision making, as well as between the roles of\nanalyst and manager (Schoemaker, 1991). Finally, an\nintegration of the methods that allows for within and\nacross case comparison can provide a documented\nrationale for a particular choice, or a shortlist of options\nsupported by an elaboration on the conditions in which\nthey perform best (Roy, 1998; Pomerol, 2001).\nTable 1 summarises the literature that involves integration\nof SP and MCDA to date. It assumes a set of scenarios\nY\u00bc {y1, . . . , ys}; a set of strategic options A\u00bc {a1, . . . , am}\nand a set of criteria (measures by which the achievement of\na particular objective is gauged) C\u00bc {c1, . . . , cn}. An\nMCDA analysis that incorporates scenarios involves\nelicitation of (a) vkir\u2014how an option ak will be perceived\nto perform in a given scenario yr with respect to a criterion\nci (value) and (b) wir\u2014how important a certain criterion ci\nis relative to another criterion cj in scenario yr (weight).\nExamination of Table 1 highlights two areas for further\ndevelopment of the combined methodology. Firstly, SP\nand MCDA interventions have typically involved the use\nof optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely scenarios. Deve-\nloping such scenarios goes against the generally accepted\nview in the scenario literature (Wack, 1985a, b;\nSchoemaker, 1991; Ringland 1998; Schwartz and Ogilvy,\n1998; De Geus, 1999). Several other relevant possibilities\nare undermined due to a dominance of value-laden notions\nor assumptions of likelihood, both of which defeat the\nunderlying philosophy of scenarios. Even so, one main\ndisadvantage of SP is the length of time taken to develop\nscenarios (Mietzner and Reger, 2005). One way to address\nthe time-consuming nature of developing the narrative and\ndifficulty in selecting two uncertainties is to apply a\nMorphological Analysis (MA) approach. This is based\non a combinatorial set of uncertainties, each of which may\ntake a small number (2\u20135) of different levels (Eden and\nAckermann, 1998; Ritchey, 2006).\nSecondly, MCDA measures resulting from each option\u2013\nscenario combination should be compared within and\nacross scenarios (Durbach and Stewart, 2003). Yet, Table 1\nshows that some SP and MCDA interventions have\nemployed the use of weights or probabilities to aggregate\nMCDA measures over all scenarios. This fails to achieve\nproper integration between the methods for two reasons.\nFirstly, it violates a key assumption of SP that every future\nis equally likely (Rosenhead et al, 1972). Secondly,\naggregating MCDA measures runs the risk of diluting\nthe rich information derived from the process. These\ninclude details on the differences between scenarios that\nfavour one option over another, or scenarios which\nparticular options may perform poorly (Dias, 2006).\nSelecting those options with stable performances close to\nthe ideal, or assessing the spread of performances for each\noption in each scenario (Montibeller et al, 2006) provide\nbetter comparison. These can be contrasted with the\nconcept of regret, which compares the performance of an\noption with the maximum achievable performance across\nall strategic options in that scenario (Lempert et al, 2006).\nRegret therefore makes explicit use of the information\nprovided by the decision maker, rather than the possible\nillusion of an ideal world that may never be achievable.\nHowever, the concept of regret has not been applied to SP\nand MCDA interventions.\n818 Journal of the Operational Research Society Vol. 62, No. 5\nTable 1 Summary of MCDA and scenario planning interventions to date\nReference Number of scenarios Approach to scenario construction Method of elicitation Recommendations for applying\nMCDA measure ie Sj(vkir \u0003wir)\nWeights (wir) Values (vkir)\nGoodwin and Wright\n(2001)\n2 \u2018extreme world\u2019\nscenarios; no\nprobabilities\nattached\nExtreme world narratives created\nby putting all negatively and\npositively resolved uncertainties\nin separate scenarios and then\nchecking for internal consistency\nK Compare 0\u2013100 for each\ncriterion ci\nK Assign 100 to the most\nimportant criterion and\ncompare it with the relative\nimportance of other swings on\na 0\u2013100 scale\nK Normalise scores obtained\nK Allocate a score of 100 to the best\nstrategy\u2013scenario combination and\n0 to the worst in terms of its\nperformance under each criterion\nK Allocate scores between 0 and 100\nto represent the improvement in\ncriterion ci that the application of\nstrategy ak may be perceived to\nbring in scenario yr for all yreY\nK Use scenario matrix to establish\ndominance of strategies across\nscenarios\nK Perform sensitivity analysis\nK Evaluate risk by including a risk\ncriterion in the MCDA model\nBelton and Stewart\n(2002)\n2 scenarios Scenario narratives are external\nto the organisation (ie, arise from\nevents outside the organisation\u2019s\ncontrol) and are value-free\nDifferent weights assigned for\neach scenario using approach as\nin Goodwin and Wright (2001)\nBest and worst performances against\neach criterion across all scenarios\ndefine upper and lower limits of the\nvalue scale\nAllocate scores between 0 and 100 to\nrepresent the improvement in\ncriterion ci that the application of\nstrategy ak may be perceived to bring\nin scenario yr\nK Select option that is robust against\nuncertainties (a direct holistic\njudgment)\nK Assign relative weights to\nscenarios and calculate a one-\ndimensional performance value for\neach alternative by multiplying the\nweight of each scenario by MCDA\nmeasure\nK Select option that maximises the\nworst aggregate performance given\nby the sum of all MCDA measures\nover all scenarios.

It also\nproposes the use of cost equivalent regret to facilitate\nwithin and across scenario comparisons. The method will\nthen be applied practically to identify benefits and\nchallenges of the proposed method. For the practical\napplication, a case study will be used. The case study has\nbeen selected as an appropriate research strategy because\nmany uncontrollable variables are involved, and the aim of\nthe research is to explore how the method behaves in a\npractical setting (Yin, 2008). The case study will be based\non the issue of the future of food security in Trinidad and\nTobago. A policy context has been chosen because it\nrepresents a unique but equally critical and relevant\napplication of the SP and MCDA method compared to\ntraditional business applications. This issue also reflects\ncharacteristics of a problem to which the proposed method\nwould be suited, namely:\nK The issue implies the existence of long-term conse-\nquences that are not known deterministically, but for\nwhich provisions must be made in the present to achieve\ncore objectives or mitigate adverse effects.\nK The cost criterion is an important consideration in the\ndecision-making process.\nK Factors affecting the decision are difficult to quantify,\nand involve conflicting objectives.\nIn what follows, the theoretical description of each\nstep is presented together with a rationale for it. This is\nfollowed by the corresponding practical implementation of\neach step.\nStep One\u2014Define the strategic question of interest\nAn appreciation of the context helps define the issue\nand the time frame within which it is to be considered.\nIn 2002, in pursuance of the Vision 2020 development\ngoals, the government of Trinidad and Tobago outlined\nthe promotion and enhancement of agriculture as a pillar\nof the national development and diversification of an\neconomy traditionally based on oil and gas (Vision 2020\nOperational Plan 2007\u20132010).\nThe majority of the country\u2019s agricultural resources have\ntraditionally focused on producing export commodities\nsuch as sugar, cocoa, coffee and citrus. Under favourable\nmarketing arrangements that assured a ready market and\nrelatively stable prices, export agriculture was profitable\n(Sector Policy for Food Production and Marine Resources,\n2001). However, as international trade regulations (eg food\nsafety standards) became increasingly unfavourable, the\ncontribution of agriculture to national GDP showed a\ndeclining trend over time. Local production of staple food\nitems (eg wheat, corn) became increasingly uncompetitive.\nThis meant that average incomes in the agricultural\nsector were the lowest in the country, and the share of\nthe labour force in agriculture, particularly among younger\nage groups, was on the decline. However, the motivation to\npursue agricultural initiatives weakened as steadily increas-\ning oil revenues, post-2002, were used to fuel a high level of\nfood imports. Thus, growth in the oil and gas sectors\nresulted in the majority of arable land being traded off for\ninfrastructure development and manufacturing industries.\nHowever, the unforeseen fall of oil prices in late 2008 and\nthe steady rise of food prices emphasised the significance of\ndeveloping an agricultural sector that could consistently\nprovide nutritionally adequate food to its citizens on a\nsustainable basis. These circumstances provoked the\nquestion of which investments were likely to be the most\nfavourable for the country in terms of food security given\nchanges in the regulatory, economic, technological and\nsocial environment.\nA time frame of 8 years was chosen. This coincided\nwith the election due to take place in 2017. Although\nthe goal of food security does not have to be met by\n2020, significant progress towards the goal must be shown\nby the election year. The current context also stresses\nthe political and economic imperative to make provi-\nsions in the present to mitigate further adverse effects. An\nexpert in the field of agriculture was deemed a suitable\ninterviewee.\nStep 6: Calculate\nRegret as a\nmeasure of\nRobustness \nStep 3: Identify\nCriteria and\nOptions \nStep 2: Identify\nKey\nUncertainties\nand Trends\nStep 1: Define\nthe Strategic\nQuestion of\nInterest\nStep 4: Develop\nScenarios  \nStep 5: Apply the \nMCDA\nFramework to\neach Scenario\nFigure 1 The six steps in the proposed method.\n820 Journal of the Operational Research Society Vol. 62, No. 5\nStep Two\u2014Identify Key Uncertainties and Trends\nKey uncertainties are events whose outcomes are uncertain\nbut will significantly affect the issue of concern\n(Schoemaker, 1995). Trends that can plausibly affect the\nissue under consideration in constructing scenarios were\nalso included since this is consistent with standard\nSP formats (Schoemaker, 1991; Van der Heijden, 1996;\nDe Geus, 1999).\nIn the case study, the traditional approach of brain-\nstorming and then plotting uncertainties on a two-\ndimensional grid to highlight the most uncertain and most\ncritical uncertainties was used. The most critical uncertain-\nties selected for the development of scenarios were:\nK Severity of natural disasters (flood, earthquake, hurri-\ncane, drought)\nK Regulation in supplier countries\nK State of global economy\nK Consumer demand for safe foods\nK Cost of farming inputs (eg fertilizer, pesticide, land)\nTrends expected to continue were:\nK High imports from other countries in the Caribbean\nregion of produce such as bananas and ground\nprovisions.\nK Competition from other sectors (eg manufacturing and\ntourism).\nK Traditional small farming as a means of livelihood in\nrural areas.\nK Population will increase to 1.5 million by 2017.\nStep Three\u2014Identify Criteria and Strategic Options\nIn keeping with the philosophy of MCDA, the criteria\npertinent to end objectives were considered. To derive this,\nseveral iterations of the question \u2018Why is this measure of\nsuccess important?\u2019 were made. The criteria corresponding\nto the objective deemed important in absolute terms\n(ie its achievement did not imply\/aid achievement of some\nother objective) were listed. This mode of questioning\nembodied the spirit of the strategic options development\nand analysis methodology (Eden and Ackermann, 1998).\nFor the case study, the expert defined food security as\nthe ability of the country to consistently provide nutrition-\nally adequate food to its citizens on a sustainable basis.\nThis implied the following key criteria:\nK Quantity of food available\u2014A good proxy for this is the\nbalance of payments account for food (indicates\nwhether net exports exceed net imports). This is\ninfluenced by per capita income, cost of food, consump-\ntion of homegrown foods and the protection of the agro\necosystem for future generations.\nK Quality of food\u2014This refers to the extent to which food\navailable contains basic nutritional value.\nK Cost of implementing strategic option\u2014The importance\nof this criterion is highlighted in the case where two\noptions yield the same quantity and quality of food.\nA set of independent options was obtained by considering\nthe option currently being used as well as the main ones\nunder consideration for the future. The discussion about\noptions with the interviewee yielded the following set of\nstrategic options:\n(A) Reduce cost of farming to subsistence farmers (greater\naccess to loans, subsidies and modern technology).\n(B) Provide basic infrastructure for farming (eg land\ntenure, road access, water access).\n(C) Exclude valuable agricultural land from areas identi-\nfied as development areas, and exclude areas of high\nbiodiversity from being used for agricultural purposes.\n(D) Promote a positive profile of the agricultural sector,\nespecially towards youths.\n(E) Mega-farm production of higher value local commod-\nities. This approach involves using natural means to\ngrow multiple crops on a large scale. It aims to exploit\nniche export markets and increase the competitiveness\nof local alternatives to imported items. This is the\noption currently being pursued most vigorously by the\ngovernment.\nThe \u2018Do-Nothing\u2019 option was not considered because it\nwas felt that it was unrealistic and might destroy key\nimplications of the scenarios for strategy. Owing to budget\nconstraints, only one option could be implemented.\nStep Four\u2014Develop Scenarios\nThe development of scenarios in this paper is supported by\nMorphological Analysis (MA). MA is a method for\nstructuring and analysing multi-dimensional technical,\nsocial and political problem complexes where quantifica-\ntion is difficult (Ritchey, 2006). It is based around\nrepresentations of the objects of interest through sets of\nvariables each of which can take a range of possible states,\nconventionally represented as a table. As a structuring tool,\na key element of MA is checking the consistency (assessing\nrelationships between variables; and that trends are\ncompatible within the time frame (Van der Heijden,\n1996)) of these various states in order to avoid a\ncombinatorial explosion in the number of possible config-\nurations. Similar ideas have been invented independently\nmultiple times in the OR literature\u2014for example in\nstrategic choice approach (Friend, 1989) and in the strategy\ntable of Howard (Howard, 1988).\nMA is well-suited to scenario development for formal\nevaluation for three reasons. Firstly, MA can deal with a\nlarger number of uncertainties that are qualitatively and\nC Ram et al\u2014Use of scenario planning and MCDA 821\nquantitatively defined. Scenarios are best suited for highly\ncomplex, uncertain situations where many factors are\nunquantifiable and virtually every factor is variable, and so\nthere are a large number of variables (Coyle, 2007; Millett,\n1988). Secondly, MA encourages the investigation of\nmultiple combinations of extreme boundary values in an\nefficient manner (Ritchey, 2006). This is very much within\nthe philosophy of SP to provide challenging views of the\nfuture. Thirdly, MA can facilitate the description of\nscenarios to the level of detail that provides the decision\nmaker with enough information for preferences to be\nelicited (Schoemaker, 1991; Stewart and Scott, 1995; Eden\nand Ackerman, 1998). This is achieved through the\ncoherent construction of parameter spaces linked by way\nof logical relationships (Ritchey, 2006).\nThe steps involved in this stage are:\nK Define the limits of each uncertainty and then establish\n2\u20133 intermediate conditions. In determining the limits,\nthe following steps are useful:\nJ Consider the best and worst possible achievement\nlevels for the criteria that can be perceived.\nJ Extend these further but keeping within plausible\nlevels, and try to envisage what uncertainty levels\nmight lead to that situation. These levels define the\nlimits.\nJ Combinations of conditions (one condition from\neach uncertainty) represent different scenarios.\nK Test for consistency\u2014This mode of scenario construc-\ntion assumes that scenarios are merely a snapshot in\ntime. Consequently, testing for consistency was neces-\nsary. The authors support the view that only those\nrelationships which the decision maker is certain about\nshould be included. Therefore, in testing for consistency,\nany well-established relationships among the set of\nuncertainties were noted.\nIn the context of the case study, a spectrum of discrete\nvalues or conditions which the uncertainty can take is\nshown in Table 2. The best case scenario is denoted by\nBBBBB (ie combination of best\/most preferable level of\neach uncertainty) and represents low severity of natural\ndisasters; supportive regulation in supplier countries;\npositive growth in the global economy; high consumer\ndemand for safe foods and low cost of farming inputs.\nSimilarly, the scenario denoted by WBBBB holds all\nconditions as in BBBBB except for the severity of natural\ndisasters, which is high.\nThere are theoretically 108 possible scenario combina-\ntions (2 \u0004 3 \u0004 3 \u0004 2 \u0004 3\u00bc 108). However, Table 3 only\nuses 12 of these combinations. Both sets of swings in\nuncertainties were considered (ie assume all uncertainties at\ntheir best (worst) level and observe a swing of each\nuncertainty in turn to its worst (best) level). Consideration\nof both swings helped achieve some balance to the extent\nthat if a picture dominated by favourable states was\nconsidered, then the trade-offs to be made in bad times\nwould be overlooked. Similarly, sole focus on unfavour-\nable scenarios would not offer a good reference for seizing\nnew opportunities.\nThis approach to reducing the number of scenarios has\ntwo justifications. Firstly, it does not violate the philosophy\nof SP. Scenarios should be relevant to the concerns of the\ndecision maker; describe generically different futures; and\nrepresent states in which the system might exist for some\nlength of time (Schoemaker, 1995). Secondly, the idea of\nusing swings in uncertainties is similar to the use of swing\nweights in the MCDA framework.\nAlthough the scenarios in the proposed method make\nuse of best and worst-case notions, they were merely used\nto broaden the interviewee\u2019s thinking on a range of\nplausible uncertainty levels. The best and worst labels\nhave been used in the paper in an illustrative manner to\nhighlight the pattern in the combinations chosen. The\ninterviewee was shown Table 2, but the scenario was\noutlined to him in a brief narrative format that included\ntrends (see Figure 2) to give a more comprehensive picture.\nStep Five\u2014Apply the MCDA framework to each Scenario\nThis step aims to measure how each strategic option\nperforms under a given scenario.

Firstly, he was asked \u2018Given scenario\nBBBBB, which strategic option do you think will perform\nbest relative to the other options in terms of the extent to\nwhich it will help achieve a desirable level on C1\n(quantity)?\u2019 Options were then ranked, with a value of\n100 being assigned to the option ranked best and 0 to the\noption ranked worst. Values for other options on each\ncriterion were assigned relative to this question of value.\nThis prompted the second question\u2014\u2018How do you think\noption A will perform in scenario BBBBB relative to the\nother options in terms of the extent to which it will help\nachieve a desirable level on C1?\u2019 For example, in scenario\nBBBBB, rank 1 went to option B and rank 5 went to\nstrategy A. B got a score of 100 and A, a score of 0. A value\nof 60 assigned to option C meant that the improvement in\nquantity from using option C over option A was roughly\n60% as attractive as the improvement in quantity from\nusing option B over A.\nResponses to these questions are shown in Table 3, with\nTable 4 providing an added illustration of what the values\ntranslate to on the scale for each criterion.\nEliciting wik involved the use of swing weighting. Swing\nweighting explicitly requires the decision maker to consider\nthe relative value between the most and least preferred\nlevels of two criteria (Goodwin and Wright, 2001). The\nquestion asked to elicit weights was\u2014\u2018If you were in\nscenario A, and one criterion could be moved to its best\nlevel, which would you choose?\u2019 The criterion ranked first\nreceived a score of 100, and the other criteria were given a\nweight relative to this score. Weights were then normalised\n(Table 5).\nThe use of a standard set of weights across scenarios\n(Goodwin and Wright, 2001) was not adopted because it\nwas felt that eliciting swing weights, given a specific\nscenario, was more compatible with examining implica-\ntions of a scenario for strategy (Parnell et al, 1999;\nBelton and Stewart, 2002; Durbach and Stewart, 2003;\nMontibeller et al, 2006). The performance of each strategic\noption under each scenario is shown in Table 6, with the\nbest performance for each scenario highlighted in bold.\nThe direct elicitation approach in this intervention\noffers two main advantages when compared with indirect\nassessment techniques. Firstly, it is consistent with value\nelicitation in other SP and MCDA interventions to date\n(see Table 1). Secondly, it facilitates greater integration\nbetween the methods since it reinforces the concept of\nseparate evaluations under each scenario while encoura-\nging discussion about the impact of future events on\nchoices in a useful and engaging manner (Belton and\nStewart, 2002).\nStep Six\u2014Calculate Regret as a measure of Robustness\nThe regret of a strategic option is defined as the difference\nbetween the performance of an option in some future\nstate of the world, given some performance function, and\nthat of what would be the best-performing option in\nthat same future state (Lempert et al, 2006).

There has been no\n major natural disaster; and regulation in supplier countries is supportive. This is\nsupported by positive growth in the global economy. Consumer demand for safe foods\n is high, and the cost of farming inputs is low.\nFigure 2 Sample scenario narrative for BBBBB.\nTable 4 Estimation of what elicited values translate to on respective criteria scales\nBBBBB WWWWW\nQuantity* (in US$) Quality Cost (in US$) Quantity (in US$) Quality Cost (in US$)\nA \u0005550 million 45% of RDI 330 million \u0005400 million 35% of RDI 250 million\nB 200 million 65% of RDIw 25 million \u0005480 million 27% of RDI 20 million\nC \u0005300 million 85% of RDI 1 million \u0005550 million 50% of RDI 1.5 million\nD \u0005200 million 57% of RDI 3 million \u0005300 million 40% of RDI 2 million\nE 150 million 75% of RDI 1 billion \u0005700 million 25% of RDI 950 million\n*Balance of payments for food=total imports\u0005total exports.

The architecture of the\nset of scenarios, Y, targets a range of these significantly\ndifferent states.\nK The measure explicitly anticipates the emotion of\nregret when evaluating different options in an effort\nto make the consequences of choice more salient.\nThis can serve to induce greater deliberation among\nchoices (Zeelenberg, 1999).\nK It complements the philosophy of the proposed method\nsince it does not employ the use of probabilities, nor\ndoes it recommend the elimination of strategic options\nthrough dominance.\nRegret thus represents the loss in value relative to the best\noption, measured on a scenario specific scale, defined by\nthe joint lower and joint upper levels of performance of the\noptions under that scenario.\nIn order to properly gauge the robustness of an option,\nthe regret values had to be converted to a comparable\nscale. To achieve this, a cost-equivalent model was\nproposed (Keeney, 1992). In the case study, scenario\nBBBBB for example had a cost range of US$949 million\n(US$950 million\u2013US$1 million), and the range of evalua-\ntion units was (100 \u0004 0.319\u00bc 31.9), each evaluation unit\nwas equivalent to US$29.75 million. In other words, the\nmarginal monetary worth for the overall (i.e. US$949m\/\n31.9) scale was US$29.75 million. To achieve a worthiness\nequivalent value for option B under this scenario, the\noverall performance\/evaluation figure was multiplied by\nthe marginal monetary worth coefficient before applying\nthe regret calculation. This procedure was repeated for\neach option\u2013scenario combination, and the results shown\nin Table 7.\nThe worth equivalent regret values for each strategic\noption across each scenario are plotted in Figure 3. The\nmost robust option would ideally have a high frequency of\nlow or zero regrets, and have a low spread of values relative\nto this point.

It can be concluded therefore that this option is\nnot robust. Further examination of regret values under this\noption highlights that this could be due to the heavy\ndependence of its success on supportive regulation in\nsupplier countries. Options B (provide basic infrastructure\nfor farming) and D (promote a positive profile of the\nagricultural sector, especially towards youths) appear more\nworthy candidates. Option B has the lowest overall spread\nof regret values. Option D would perform better if\nmechanisms could be included that minimise its highest\nregret, which occurs in scenario WBBBB, when the severity\nof natural disaster is high. Such a mechanism might include\nthe development of a comprehensive disaster preparedness\nplan. This is particularly interesting as it highlights the\nimportance of building capabilities for food security should\na sudden disruption in food supply occur, which is\nprecisely what has not been pursued in the status quo.\nOne similarity between options B and D that makes them\nmore successful than other options is their orientation\ntowards empowerment and self-sufficiency. These findings\ncan provide a basis for further discussion of options that\nare compatible with this theme. Regret values may then be\nrecalculated, but it must be borne in mind that regret\ndepends on a given set of strategic options, and so the\nregret value may change as new options are added or\nexisting ones deleted (French, 1986).\nA number of assumptions underpin the approach\noutlined here:\n1. There are generally preferred directions of movement\nfor criterion that hold no matter what other criteria\nvalues are (eg higher quality of food) (Keeney and\nRaiffa, 1993).\n2. The set of criteria are preferentially independent\n(Keeney, 1992).\n3. The decision maker is able to provide the judgments\nrequired by the method.\n4.

Examining best\u2013worst (worst\u2013best) swings in uncertain-\nties help provide meaningful information on how\nchanges in the environment affect preferences.\n6. Attribute functions are linear and cost is a signi-\nficant attribute in the value model (Keeney and von\nWinterfeldt, 2007).\nDiscussion\nThe proposed method explores ways to achieve a diverse\nset of scenario themes quickly and facilitate within and\nacross scenario comparison of options, while being able to\nhandle subjective judgments for multiple objectives under\nuncertainty. The implementation of the proposed method\nalso highlights scope for improvement in these areas.\nThe proposed method developed scenarios based on\nswings in extreme possibilities of a set of five uncertainties.\nThe interviewee felt that this approach tried to capture\nmany factors that should be considered in making a\ndecision and helped him to focus on prioritising items to\nachieve ends objectives with limited financial resources.\nThe proposed method of achieving a diverse set of\nscenarios to form a basis for measuring robustness can\nbe contrasted with scenario narratives constructed around\nthe impacts of decisions (Schoemaker, 1991; Stewart and\nScott, 1995); variations of parameters of a system model,\nwhich are mathematically defined (Tietje, 2005); varying\nperspectives of a desirable future (Gordon, 2008); or minor\nvariations to one or more emergent conditions such that\nevaluation in accordance with stakeholder concerns is\npermitted (Karvetski et al, 2010).\nThe interviewee found that the level of detail was\nsufficient for eliciting the required answers, even though\nthe scenario presented was an outline of a future point in\ntime (Schoemaker, 1991), and not a storyline of how the\nfuture might unfold from the present to an end state\n(Van der Heijden, 1996; De Geus, 1999). In making value\nand weight judgments, he was prompted to consider how\nchoosing an option now might plausibly behave in a parti-\ncular scenario with respect to each criterion. He therefore\nacknowledged that in-depth knowledge of both the\ntechnical aspects of the problem and the decision-making\ninstrument were required in providing judgments.\nHe felt that applying the method in a group decision-\nmaking process would have been more useful, as it would\nhave provided a basis for debate and validation of opinions\nwith respect to criteria. However, the repetition of weight\nand value elicitation questions was perceived by the\ninterviewee as time-consuming and inconvenient, especially\nafter about the seventh scenario. One way of addressing\nthis issue is based on adapting the framework of the swing\nweighting method for recalibration of a baseline value\nfunction, following incremental adjustment of the baseline\n(Karvetski et al, 2010). While this may reduce the time and\neffort needed for elicitation, an anchor and adjust strategy\nmay fail to encourage the decision maker to explore\ngenerically different futures that challenge the status quo,\nwhich lies at the heart of SP philosophy. In addition, this\nmethod would not be applicable in cases like the one\npresented here, where scenarios alter not only how the\ndecision maker forms his\/her preferences across criteria,\nbut also how he\/she perceives each option will perform.\nWith respect to within and across scenario comparison\nof options, the interviewee felt that visualisation of regret\nmeasures helped to crystallise the purpose of the exercise.\nHe thought that cost-equivalent measures were also useful\ngiven a circumstance of financial constraints. The main\nadvantage of the illustrative display used in this paper is\nthat it allows the decision maker to see how much better\/\nworse an option performs compared to another. Since a\nsingle MCDA model is created for each scenario\n(Montibeller et al, 2006), within-scenario value functions\nare not commensurable. Comparison of performance\nacross scenarios is therefore facilitated only through the\nuse of cost-equivalent figures. This can be contrasted with\nranking (Karvetski et al, 2010), which does not provide\nsuch visualisation; and box plot displays (Lempert et al,\n2006) with cumulative frequency percentage charts\n(Bertsch, 2008), which provide information concerning\nhow often each performance measure occurs. Stacked bar\ncharts, cobweb diagrams (Karvetski et al, 2010) and value\npaths (Schilling et al, 1983) would also provide practical\ndisplays to identify the most important and sensitive\ncriteria across scenarios; as well as those criteria with the\nlargest potential for relative improvement.\nApplication of the proposed method highlights three\nmain challenges. The first is reducing the demand on\ndecision makers for elicitation of weights and values. The\nsecond relates to extending the method to formally\nincorporate group decision making, which would imply\nconsideration of a range of values and weights that reflect\nmultiple perspectives. The development of a common\nmodel may also be possible, assuming communication\namong stakeholders is desirable (Belton and Stewart,\n2002). Applying the method in a group situation would\ninevitably be very time-consuming and likely to require\nsoftware support (Wollenberg et al, 2000). The third\nchallenge relates to the incorporation of new options that\nmay develop as a result of the evaluation process. Given\nthat direct elicitation was used, including any new options\nto test whether they do improve robustness may necessitate\nthe redefinition of scales (Belton and Stewart, 2002).\nConclusions and directions for further research\nThe main contribution of this paper was to illustrate how a\nmore diverse set of scenarios that copes well with\nqualitative and quantitatively defined variables could be\ndeveloped quickly; and to investigate how regret could be\nC Ram et al\u2014Use of scenario planning and MCDA 827\napplied to MCDA measures facilitate within and across\nscenario comparisons.\nThe structure of the method was influenced by three\nmain assumptions adopted by the authors, but arising from\nexamination of the relevant literature. The first assumption\nis that the combined use of SP and MCDA is beneficial\nwhen considering the evaluation of strategic options. The\nsecond is that scenarios are intended to be challenging\ndescriptions of futures that are relevant to a strategic\ndecision and representative of plausible developments in\nthe external world (Van der Heijden, 1996). However, the\nuse of scenarios for the evaluation of options has often\ninvolved the consideration of optimistic, pessimistic and\nmost-likely scenarios. These are limited in their capacity to\nprovide a representative range of variation that could occur\nand also goes against the generally accepted view in the\nSP literature. The third is that MCDAmeasures should not\nbe aggregated over scenarios through the use of weights or\nprobabilities since it contravenes the philosophies of both\nmethods.\nPractical benefits from applying the method included a\ngreater awareness by the interviewee of interactions among\nkey components of a strategic decision; a purposeful\ndisplay of measures to facilitate comparison of options\nanchored in cost considerations; and an interest in applying\nthe method to a group decision-making process. The\nfindings in this paper are nonetheless tentative. They have\nonly been based on a single case, and more will be needed\nto confirm them. From a theoretical perspective, the\nmethod sought to stimulate investigation of how many\nscenarios are sufficient for use in evaluating options, and\non the level of detail appropriate for using scenarios to\nevaluate strategic options, about which there remains a\nlack of literature and evidence from practice.\nThe paper suggests various directions for further\nresearch. Firstly, there is scope for investigating whether\na more diverse set of scenarios with its increased elicitation\nburden justifies the loss of detail in the traditional narrative\nformat in terms of quality and time taken. This prompts\nquestions on how the demand on decision makers for\nelicitation of weights and values can be reduced, and on\nhow effective best\u2013worst swings are in scenario selection. It\nmay be possible to achieve this by using incomplete\ninformation about preferences with software support.\nSecondly, how this method may be adapted to accom-\nmodate multiple perspectives in an interactive group\ndecision-making process remains an open question.\nThirdly, the use of regret as a meaningful measure of\nrobustness in such interventions also deserves further\nexploration. Finally, this paper has focused on the selection\nof robust options. However, assessments on whether\noptions are flexible (ie option can easily transform to\naccommodate new conditions) (Mingers and Rosenhead,\n2001) and diversified (ie facilitates investment in a range of\ndifferent areas relative to the organisation\u2019s current major\noffering(s)) (Wright and Goodwin, 2009) may improve the\nquality of options entering the evaluation process.\nAcknowledgements\u2014The authors wish to thank the agricultural expert\nfor his willingness to provide information for the case study and for his\nvaluable comments on the method applied.\nReferences\nBelton V and Stewart TJ (2002).
