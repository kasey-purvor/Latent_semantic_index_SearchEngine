During this time the fish remain inactive, cease\nfeeding, and reduce protein synthesis and growth [2,3]. However,\ndormancy in fish is thought to significantly differ from obligatory\nhibernating vertebrates [1,2,3,4,5,6]. This is because the reduction\nin metabolism during winter correlates with the declining water\ntemperature and can be overturned by temperature reversal\n[4,5,6]. Recent studies have found that otoliths from Antarctic\nNotothenioid fish display distinct growth annuli [7,8], demon-\nstrating that they too have seasonal variations in growth. The\ncessation of growth by Notothenioids during winter months\nappears paradoxical, because the Antarctic marine environment is\nconsidered one of the most thermally stable regimes on the planet\n[9] and these fish are often demersal omnivores living in shallow\nproductive waters, where suitable prey are available all year round\n[10,11,12].\nThe Notothenioids include many species that remain in the\ninshore waters of the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic islands\nyear round. This fish group has been overwhelmingly successful in\nthe Southern Ocean and no other oceanic ecosystem is so\ndominated by a single taxonomic group of fish [13]. Previous\nstudies that have tagged and recaptured Notothenioid fish, have\ndemonstrated a 5-fold decline in growth rates from summer to\nwinter months [12,14,15,16]. It is very unlikely that the small\nseasonal change in near-shore Antarctic sea water temperatures is\nthe major factor driving the observed large seasonal change in\ngrowth rates, as this would imply an unrealistic thermal sensitivity\n(a 5-fold change in growth for a seasonal 2uC temperature\nchange). The virtual absence of solar radiation during winter,\ncoupled with expansion of the sea ice, is responsible for producing\namongst the lowest phytoplankton standing stocks anywhere on\nearth and, therefore, the lowest energy transfer through the\nmarine food web [9]. Clarke [17] proposed that this temporal\nvariation in food supply formed the basis of seasonal growth\npatterns in polar invertebrates. However, there is no evidence to\nsuggest that the food supply of Antarctic fish is restricted during\nwinter [10,11,12]. Moreover, the inshore fishes Notothenia coriiceps\nand Harpagifer antarcticus exhibit a reduction in feeding activity and\na mobilisation of lipid reserves when acclimated to a winter\nphotoperiod in the laboratory [12,16,18]. This decline in feeding\noccurred even when food was available in excess of that eaten;\nsuggesting that decrease in growth rate during winter is a product\nof appetite suppression rather than food limitation per se. We\nhypothesised that the reduction in growth observed in Notothe-\nnioid fish during the Antarctic winter occurs due to a seasonal\nswitch in ecological strategy, from one which maximises the\nprocurement of food to another which minimises the energetic cost\nof living.\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1743\nTo test this hypothesis we have examined the behavioural and\nmetabolic strategy of the Antarctic fish Notothenia coriiceps, a\nwidespread omnivorous predator of the Antarctic and sub\nAntarctic inshore waters. Swimming activity, heart rate (fH) and\nmetabolism were recorded by miniaturised electronic devices over\na full annual cycle, as the fish responded to the annual physical\nand biotic fluxes of the Southern Ocean. From this extensive\ndataset, together with seasonal measurements of growth and\nfeeding from wild fish, we show that N. coriiceps employs a\nhibernation\u2013like ecological strategy during winter months. This\nfinding is of profound interest, firstly because this type of ecological\nsurvival strategy has typically been considered to only occur in\nhigher terrestrial vertebrates, and secondly, because these fish\nalready live at the extreme lower thermal limit for physiological\nand metabolic processes.\nResults\nGrowth and feeding\nA total of 118 immature adult N. coriiceps were caught by either\nfyke net or rod and line between Jan 2004 and Feb 2005. Of these,\n21 were recaptured a second time within the year and 4 fish were\nrecaptured more than once (Fig. 1). The highest specific growth\nrates (Gw) were recorded in fish captured and recaptured between\nJanuary\u2013April (the austral summer) than at other times of year\n(Tukey HSD modified for unequal groups, F = 8.6, P,0.05,\nn = 25). The maximum Gw (0.21% bd. wt. d\n21) was measured in a\nfish that was at liberty for 62 days between January and March.\nNine fish that were tagged in the autumn and were recaptured in\nthe early spring, thus the days of liberty only included winter\nmonths, exhibited close to zero or negative Gw. Growth rates in\nthese animals can be considered as representative of winter\nanimals. The Gw of two fish that were at liberty for almost a full\nyear was 0.052 and 0.041% bd. wt. d21and are probably fairly\nrepresentative of yearly field growth rates of N. coriiceps at Rothera.\nIt was necessary to keep the fish fitted with fH dataloggers in sea-\ncages to enable serial sampling throughout the year. Gw was also\ndetermined in these fish on a bimonthly basis and showed a\nseasonal pattern similar to that seen in free-ranging fish (Fig. 1).\nThat is, much higher growth rates in summer compared to winter.\nIn February (summer) the Gw rate was 0.178% bd. wt. d\n21. It\ndeclined rapidly after March (autumn) and reached a minimum of\n20.02% bd. wt. d21 in June (winter). During winter growth rates\nwere negative, hence fish lost body mass. The decline in body mass\ncontinued until October (spring), after which the Gw rapidly\nincreased, peaking at 0.172% bd. wt. d21 in January 2004. The\nGw from June to August was significantly lower than the Gw\nbetween December and February. (Tukey HSD, F2, 10 = 10.8,\nP,0.01). The within group variance was very low during winter\nmonths, when most fish showed negligible or negative growth\nrates, but had increased 10-fold by the summer when growth rate\nwas high. This indicates that net energy gain differed between sea-\ncaged fish; nevertheless, the large summer increase in Gw was still\nsignificant (ANOVA, F 2, 10 = 19.1, P,0.01).\nCapture rates during winter months were very low, but 5 fish\nwere captured in July so allowing gut content analysis. These fish\nshowed significantly (Tukey HSD test with modification for\nunequal n numbers F= 30.12, P,0.01, n= 5 & 9) less food in\nthe gut (8.161.9 mg.g bd. wt.21) than 9 fish captured in January\n(27.263.4 mg.g bd. wt.21). The food in the gut of winter caught\nfish also consisted mainly of digested matter (61.4265.4%), which\ncomposed a much smaller portion (18.1763.2%) of the gut\ncontent of fish caught during summer (F= 24.3, P,0.01, n= 5 &\n9).\nActivity\nFish movement was tracked continuously within a 1 km2 area\nusing a static hydrophone array between March 2004 and March\n2005. Only seven of the original 20 fish implanted with acoustic\ntransmitters confined their complete daily and annual behavioural\nrepertoire within the boundaries of the tracking zone. A sweep\nsearch every 100 m, up to 1 km outside the study area with a boat-\nmounted hydrophone, found 6 individuals 28\u2013543 m outside of\nthe study area. Other tagged individuals may have migrated\nfurther from the study site, but loss of study animals by transmitter\nfault or predation cannot be discounted. Even when fish were\nlocated within the tracking zone the software could not always\ndetermine location. This occurred because the acoustic pulse from\nthe transmitter was not received by all 3 hydrophones in every\ninstance and hence the position could not be triangulated. An in\nability to fix individual fish occurred far more frequently during\nwinter months. Investigation by SCUBA divers suggested fish that\ncould not be fixed were located in crevices or under rocks, thereby\nblocking the transmitter signal.\nFor each of the 4 designated seasons the fish showed a restricted\nhome range, and movements within this area were non-random as\ntested by the Moran statistic (Table 1; X2.0.25, P,0.05, n= 7).\nAll fish showed high site fidelity to a central area of approximately\n5\u201310 m2. However, the relative size of the home range, and the\nvariance in probability distribution for the number of fixes made\nbetween cells, showed significant differences between seasons\n(Fig. 2, Table 1). Fish occupied a relatively large home range\nduring summer months. However, ranges reduced in size during\nautumn and by winter occupied a 6-fold smaller area than during\nthe summer. The mean daily swimming distance was reduced 20-\nfold between summer and winter, and the spatial distribution of N.\ncoriiceps within its home range was concentrated within a much\nsmaller core area during winter (Fig. 2, Table 1). In spring (Sept\u2013\nNov) the home range increased in size but the fish still\nconcentrated a large portion of their activity within a small core\narea (5\u201310 m2). By December this had changed significantly\nFigure 1. The mass specific growth rate (Gw) of free-ranging\nand sea-caged N. coriiceps. A total of 21 immature adult N. coriiceps\n(4 recaptured twice) were tagged, released and then recaptured\nbetween 2nd Jan 2004 and 12th March 2005. The black crosses indicate\nthe date of first and subsequent capture and the average Gw for an\nindividual fish during its days at liberty indicated by the connecting\nblack line. The red line connects calculations of Gw (n = 6) measured\nfrom sea-caged fish every 8 weeks. For clarity the standard error is not\nshown on the graph, which from May to Oct was ,0.003% bd. wt. d21,\nand from Nov to Apr ,0.031% bd. wt. d21).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001743.g001\nHibernation in Antarctic fish\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1743\n(Table 1), and the fish were now spending equal proportions of\ntheir time at more locations throughout their home range. The\nmaximum distance a fish traveled within an hour was also\nsignificantly greater (ANOVA, F 4, 5664 = 54.05, P,0.01) in\nsummer than in other seasons (Table 1).\nHeart rate and metabolism\nPrior to the fish fitted with fH dataloggers being released into\nsea-cages, their fH and oxygen consumption (MO2) were measured\nin the laboratory using a static respirometry chamber. There was a\nstrong linear relationship (r2 = 0.86, n= 559) between fH and MO2\nfor N. coriiceps (Fig. 3). Both fH and MO2 showed similar ranges\nfrom minimum to maximum values in January and July. However,\nthe whole range was displaced to lower values in both measures in\nwinter. Therefore, the ratio of MO2 with fH did not change\nsignificantly between measurements taken in January and July\n(F = 2.54, P = 1.05, number of fish = 6, number of observa-\ntions = 559), and a single overall regression equation (0.148 X\u2013\n0.14, r2 = 0.86) was therefore used to estimate field metabolic rate\nfrom the fH of sea-caged fish throughout the year.\nThe mean fH recorded from fish inhabiting sea-cages during\nFebruary was 25.261.2 min21 and the estimated field MO2 for\nthis month was 3.5960.78 mg O2 100 g\n21 h21 (Fig. 4). Between\nFebruary and April there was a 23% decline in fH and therefore\nMO2. The fall in sea water temperature to the yearly low\n(21.860.02uC) occurred in mid-April, and thus succeeded the\ndecline in N. coriiceps metabolism. Between June and October fH\nshowed little variability and remained around 1160.8 min21 with\na calculated metabolic rate of 1.48 mg O2 100 g\n21 h21.\nConsequently, summer and winter metabolism differed by 58%.\nDuring November and December fH and water temperature\nsteadily increased, however by mid-December water temperatures\nreached the summer maximum of 0.760.02uC whilst fH and MO2\ncontinued to rise through December until February.\nIn a separate, controlled laboratory experiment we measured\nstandard metabolic rate (SMR) and resting fH in starved non-\nswimming N. coriiceps. The difference between summer and winter\nstandard metabolism in these fish was 29% (T 2, 12 = 3.6, P,0.01, ).\nReversing the small difference between summer and winter water\ntemperatures produced no significant change (T 2, 12 =20.4,\nP= 0.64) in fH or MO2 of laboratory fish (Table 2).\nPeriodic arousals\nThe activity of free-ranging fish during summer months varied\nbetween 0 and 38.4 m h21, with no evident circadian rhythm.\nThis contrasted to winter months when the fish were sedentary for\nmuch of the time, but exhibited short bouts (1\u20133 hours) of activity\nwhere rates were similar to summer. These short bouts of activity\nin winter occurred between every 4 to 12 days (Fig. 5A).\nA similar seasonal profile was seen in the fH of fish held in sea-\ncages. In summer fH was very variable and ranged between 12 and\n26 beats min21, and there was no evidence of circadian\nrhythmicity (Fig. 5B). During winter months the fH was less\nvariable and .2-fold slower than during the summer months\n(ANOVA, F 2, 55447 = 584, P,0.01).The low winter fH was\nintermittently elevated every 4\u201312 days for periods lasting a few\nhours. During these periods fH was elevated to rates similar to\nsummer months.\nSCUBA divers visiting winter refuges of fish in which movement\ncould not be detected by acoustic telemetry, found the fish to be\ninitially unresponsive to handling (Fig. 6). After 20 to 60 sec of\nhandling the fish would become active and swim off, albeit\nsluggishly. In summer SCUBA divers could not handle wild N.\ncoriiceps in this way.\nDiscussion\nThe Antarctic marine environment is characterised by continual\nnear-freezing temperatures, and highly seasonal primary produc-\ntivity driven by the lack of light in winter [17]. In these conditions\nthe Antarctic Notothenioid fish have flourished, although the\necological strategy adopted by these fish to endure the Antarctic\nwinter is poorly understood. Data reported here from field\nobservations over an annual cycle illustrate, for the first time, a\ntactic of metabolic suppression that displays many parallels with\nhibernation-like responses from higher vertebrate classes.\nNotothenia coriiceps in this study were exposed to natural\nconditions typical of the Southern Ocean: large seasonal\ndifferences in photoperiod and primary productivity, but little\nvariation in temperature. Free-ranging and sea-caged N. coriiceps in\nour study exhibited a significant winter decrease in activity, fH,\nmetabolism and growth. Previous studies on Antarctic notothe-\nnioids have also demonstrated a winter reduction in growth rates\n[10,11,12,14,15,16]. N. coriiceps is likely to have exhibited a loss of\nmass during winter due to reduced feeding and a reliance on\nendogenous lipid reserves [18]. Prey capture is likely to be\nassociated with foraging activity. There could be many reasons for\nthe reduction in foraging activity, including a reduced ability in a\nvisual predator to capture food in low light conditions in winter.\nIrrespective of the underlying cause, the sedentary behaviour of\nthe fish during winter months partially explains the reduction in\nTable 1.

This was possible because cardiac output (CO) is a robust\nindicator of metabolic rate [20] and Antarctic fish modulate CO\nchiefly by changes in fH [21]. In N. coriiceps the oxygen pulse (MO2:\nfH) did not vary between summer and winter seasons, and therefore,\nconfirmed that for this species fH was a highly reliable indicator of\nmetabolism. Our results demonstrated a 58% suppression in the\ntotal metabolic rate (TMR) from wild N. coriiceps between summer to\nwinter months, and the seasonal difference in water temperature\nwas not responsible for the seasonal shift in fH or MO2. The active\nsuppression of MO2 and fH, irrespective of temperature, is a novel\nobservation in fish and may correspond to the metabolic rate\ndepression at the onset of hibernation of other vertebrates, where\nentry is also independent of body temperature [22].\nThe disparity in standard metabolic rate between the winter\ndormant period and the summer active period was relatively small\n(29%) compared to that of hibernating endotherms [22]. Never-\ntheless, the difference between summer and winter metabolism\noccurred in the absence of thermoregulatory requirements, and\nsuggests an active suppression of physiological processes. Indeed, fH\nwas reduced 2-fold and food processing may have been down-\nregulated in dormant N. coriiceps (as implied by the 3-fold increase in\ndigested matter found in the gut of wintering compared to summer\nfish). Laboratory studies on seasonally acclimated N. coriiceps have\nalso reported a winter depression in muscle and liver enzyme\nactivity [23], and the non-responsiveness of N. coriiceps to human\nhandling when taken from a winter refuge was reflective of the\nreduced sensory and motor capabilities documented in hibernating\nspecies, another energy saving physiological response [25].\nIn this study, although a significant seasonal difference was\nfound in the metabolic rates of laboratory held fish, the change\nfrom summer to winter standard metabolic rates was much less\nthan that recorded in wild N. coriiceps. A possible reason for the lack\nof dormancy behaviour in the laboratory fish may be due to a\ndisturbance effect, which is well documented to interrupt\nhibernation and delay the entry into dormancy of many\nhibernating animals [23]. This may also explain why previous\nstudies that transported N. coriiceps outside Antarctica, where little\nor no seasonal signal was evident, and then acclimated those fish to\nseasonal conditions in the laboratory observed negligible metabolic\nsuppression [18,24].\nThe suppression of standard metabolism and fH during winter\ncorrelated with the cessation of activity. Interestingly, wintering N.\ncoriiceps showed short periodic episodes when both fH and\nbehavioural activity were elevated to summer rates. This\ndemonstrated that during the dormant period N. coriiceps\nFigure 3. The seasonal relationship between heart rate (fH) and\noxygen consumption (MO2) in N. coriiceps.

Fish\nwere collected from sea-cages and immediately placed into a closed\ncircuit respirometer, oxygen consumption and fH were recorded\nsimultaneously.

The\nreason for such arousals is at present unclear, but the necessity of\nN. coriiceps to partake in these energetically expensive arousals\ndraws further parallels with other hibernating groups. Why\nhibernating animals undergo expensive arousals is a subject of\nmuch speculation, and along with the proximal signals remain a\nlong-standing, unresolved question of hibernate research [25].\nIt is considered that the \u2018Zeitgeber\u2019 for most animals to enter\nseasonal hibernation is either environmental temperature or\nphotoperiod [4,5]. Fish have an overt sensitivity to light and the\nseasonal extremes of photoperiod at high latitudes in the absence\nof thermal change make it an obvious environmental cue for N.\ncoriiceps. Polar fish certainly have the ability to anticipate winter\nconditions, e.g. Atlantic wolf fish held in constant darkness\nupregulate antifreeze proteins and blood electrolytes to protect\nthemselves from expected winter ice crystal formation [26]. Most\nhibernators seek constant darkness to assist with entry into\nhibernation and this has recently been shown to stimulate the\nexpression of genes facilitating hibernation in mammals [27].\nConclusions\nHibernation is a complex subject, with animals continually\nbeing described as hibernators that challenge traditional views\nFigure 5.

This, and the ability to anticipate and\ncompensate for marked seasonal effects may have contributed to\nthe success of the Notothenioids in the Southern Ocean. Finally,\nthe ability of N. coriiceps to actively suppress physiological processes\nbeyond what is generally viewed as the extreme lower thermal\nthreshold highlights that the \u2018over-wintering\u2019 Antarctic fish may be\nharbouring further cellular secrets.\nMethods\nStudy site and fish\nThe study was conducted in a 1 km2 inshore area off Rothera\nResearch Station (British Antarctic Survey), Adelaide Island (67u\n349S 68u 089W), Antarctica. Notothenia coriiceps (457628 g, n= 166)\nwere caught by fyke net and only immature adults were selected\nfor the study, in order to avoid factors associated with reproductive\ncycles. Seasonal variation in growth has been shown to have no\ngender dependence and therefore this was not taken into\nconsideration when sampling [10,14]. After capture fish were\ntaken immediately to an aquarium at ambient sea water\ntemperature and photoperiod. All surgical procedures for tag\nattachment were undertaken within an air-cooled room (0uC), and\nthe fish were anaesthetised in MS222 (0.3 g l21), before being\nplaced on an operating table where their gills were irrigated with\naerated seawater containing MS222 (0.1 g l21).\nGrowth and feeding of free-ranging fish\nBetween Jan 2004\u2013Mar 2005 118 N. coriiceps (418613 g) were\ncaught, weighed, their lengths determined, and a numbered T-bar\nanchor tag (FD-64, Floy tag, Seattle, U.S.A.) fitted between the\ndorsal rays. The procedure took less than 2 min and the fish were\nreturned at point of capture. Fish which were subsequently\nrecaptured were measured, weighed and released, following\nweekly net-laying. Specific growth rate (Gw in % body weight\nday21) was calculated using the following equation [14]:\nGW~\nlogWt2{logWt1\u00f0 \u00de\nt2{t1\u00f0 \u00de \u0001 100\nWhere: W=body weight\nt~time\nGut content analysis was undertaken on 5 N. coriiceps (425628 g)\ncaptured by fyke nets in winter months and 9 (489622 g) captured\nduring summer. The fish were weighed and total gut content\nexpressed per mg of total fresh body mass.\nAcoustic tracking\nIn March 2004, 20 N. coriiceps (436628 g), were implanted with\nan acoustic transmitter (VS8, Vemco Ltd, Nova Scotia, Canada),\nwhich emitted a pulse every 15\u201330 s and had an acoustic range of\n250m. The transmitter, which had a battery life of 400 d, was\nsurgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity via a 2 cm incision\nmade behind the left pectoral fin. The muscle was closed using an\ninterrupted stitch with a 5\/0 catgut suture and the skin closed\nusing a non-interrupted stitch with 5\/0 nylon monofilament;\nsurgery took ,12 min. The fish were recovered and kept under\nobservation for 24 h before being released at the point of capture.\nFish position was determined in the field using a purpose built\nstatic hydrophone array, consisting of three fixed acoustic receivers\n(VR2 receiver, Vemco Ltd) with a detection radius of 210 m.\nThese were anchored to the seabed using climbing pitons.\nReceivers were placed 130 m apart and floated 2\u20139 m above\nthe sea-bed, so that each was at the same depth (depth was\naccounted for when fish position was determined). The exact\nlocation in longitude and latitude coordinates of each hydrophone\nwas determined by a hand held GPS system (GPS 76, Garmin,\nU.S.A.), taking the average latitude and longitude measurements\nover a 5 min period at the water surface directly above the\nhydrophone. ARCGIS software used these coordinates to plot\nposition onto a scaled, orthorectified aerial photograph of the\nstudy area (MAGIC, British Antarctic Survey). The position of\neach fish that carried an acoustic transmitter was calculated by\ntriangulation based on the relative position of each hydrophone,\nthe speed of sound through the water and the difference in timing\nof the pulse arriving at each specific hydrophone. Pilot studies\nfound this method to be accurate to ,0.3 m.\nRecording heart rate from fish held in sea-cages\nIn February 2004, miniature electronic micro-controlled data\nloggers (DL), capable of making high resolution recordings of\nECG during free-ranging activity were attached to 6 N. coriiceps\n(589634 g). The DL and housing was neutrally buoyant in water.\nA rubber saddle was permanently secured through the dorsal rays\nof the fish with nylon T-bar tags (FD-64, Floy tag Seattle, U.S.A),\nand the ECG electrodes (0.2 mm, Teflon coated 7-strand stainless\nsteel wire, A\u2013M systems, Connecticut, U.S.A.) were placed\nsubcutaneously using a hypodermic needle a few mm through\nthe septum behind the 4th left gill arch. The saddle and recording\nelectrodes could be quickly attached or detached from the DL.\nThe ECG was analysed in situ by a microprocessor using\nproprietary software that performed waveform analysis to generate\ninter-beat intervals and, thus, instantaneous fH. The logger was\nprimarily used in inter-beat mode but was also programmed to\nrecord two complete ECG waves every 4000 beats, to validate the\nquality of the ECG signal and the veracity of the calculated fH\nFigure 6. SCUBA diver holding a non-responsive hibernating N.\ncoriiceps. The fish was collected from under the Antarctic sea-ice in\nAugust from 18 m depth, temperature 21.8uC.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001743.g006\nHibernation in Antarctic fish\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1743\n(details in 30). The DL also recorded ambient temperature every\nminute to a resolution of 60.3uC. Fish fitted with the DL were\nhoused individually within 4 m3 cages secured to the sea bed.\nThe DL needed to be exchanged every 60 d for battery\nreplacement and data download. To enable DL exchange with\nminimal disturbance to the fish a cylindrical tube 20 cm\nD650 cm L with double threaded end caps was placed in each\npen, in which the fish would naturally seek refuge. The fish would\nalways retreat inside the refuge when a SCUBA diver was in close\nproximity. The diver would open the pen, attach threaded end\ncaps to both ends of the refuge, and remove it from the pen. On\narrival at the water surface the refuge was immediately submerged\ninto a large insulated holding tank containing sea water at ambient\ntemperature then transported to an air temperature controlled\naquarium approximately 100 m away. In the aquarium, each\nrefuge was submerged in light anaesthetic (MS222 0.1 g21) for\n5 min. Once anaesthetized the fish was removed and placed on an\noperating table where its gills where flushed with fresh aerated sea\nwater, to commence recovery. The housing cap was removed and\nthe datalogger quickly exchanged (,2 min). The caps were\nsecured onto the refuge and submerged in a large holding tank.\nThe fish was returned to its original sea cage using the reverse of\nthe collection procedure.\nThe cages had a large mesh size so that smaller prey items could\nenter the sea-cage, but to assist in attracting small invertebrate prey\nitems a bait ball of chopped fish was inserted in the cage every month.\nExtrapolation of field MO2 from fH\nPrior to release into the sea-cages, in January and June 2004 fish\nwere first placed into a cylindrical respirometry chamber (8 cm\nD630 cm L; vol 5 l) for 72 hours. All chambers were immersed\ninto an aerated water bath that was continually flushed with fresh\nsea water at ambient sea temperature. Each chamber was fitted\nwith two submersible pumps (100 l h21, Interpet, UK), one\ncirculated the water around the chamber whilst the other flushed\nthe chamber with aerated water from the water bath. This created\na flow rate of 0.3 cm s21 within the chamber. Water was extracted\nautomatically from each chamber in series, via a rotor valve\n(Omnifit, Birmingham, UK), and injected into a purpose made\nflow cell containing a polarographic oxygen electrode (Strathkel-\nvin, Glasgow, UK). The oxygen concentration from each chamber\nwas sampled at 1 Hz for 15 minutes every two hours and during\nthis period fH was recorded simultaneously by the attached data\nlogger (see above). The relative oxygen depletion was calculated as\na rate constant (only depletion traces with an r2.0.90 were used in\ncalculations). Adjustments were made for the dissolved oxygen in\nseawater at ambient temperature, the volume of the chamber, and\nthe mass of the fish and subsequent water displacement. MO2\nvalues were then converted by the mass exponent for summer\n(0.82) and winter (0.76) immature adult N. coriiceps [22].\nIn a separate respirometry study, N. coriiceps (343623g, n= 6)\ncaught by fyke net in January and July were held in a large circular\ntank held at ambient sea temperature under local photoperiod.\nThe instantaneous ECG and MO2 were recorded in fish after 72 h\nundisturbed rest in a respirometry chamber (as above). After the\nrecordings were made on resting fish the seasonal temperature was\nreversed so that the June external water bath (21.8uC) was\nwarmed to 1uC, and in January lowered to 21.8uC. Recordings of\nfH and MO2 were made 48 h later. Photoperiod was kept as per\nlocal conditions i.e. constant light in January and darkness in June.\nStatistical analysis\nVariance in activity parameters was tested using the F-test\nstatistic and the means compared by multivariate analysis. To test\nthat fish movement within the home range was not random, a\nweighting or connectivity matrix was generated to represent the\nspatial arrangement of each cell. The Moran statistic was\nemployed to determine if data values within a cell were influenced\nby data values of other nearby cells [31]. Seasonality effects or the\neffects of treatment on mean physiological parameters were tested\nusing the Students-paired t-test or Durban Watson statistic for\nserial autocorrelation. To test for seasonal shifts in specific growth\nrate the Tukey HSD test was employed and fish were grouped\ndepending on the season which the initial and subsequent\nmeasurements were recorded. Sometimes this statistic needed to\nbe adjusted for unequal size of groups. All statistics were applied\nusing Statgraphics 5.1 or Minitab 12.0 software and were deemed\nsignificant at P,0.05.\nAcknowledgments\nThe resolute support of the Rothera Research Station SCUBA team, and\nstation staff is gratefully acknowledged.
