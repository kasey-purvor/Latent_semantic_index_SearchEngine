Scholarly treatment of food quality remains incomplete: it \nis either confined to a single product (bread, milk, pasta, wine and so on), to one aspect \n(sanitary integrity, compositional standards, convenience, taste), or to the genesis of national \nlaws to regulate the food business at the turn of the twentieth century (Great Britain 1860, \nGermany 1879 down to Yugoslavia 1930 and Norway 1933). General histories as well as \nencyclopaedias of food and foodways scatter comments on quality among many different \nentries and discrete observations. The resulting impression is that of a protean notion hovering \nacross time and space, always acknowledged as an important factor in everyday lives but still \nawaiting a comprehensive analysis of its many facets as an organizing principle in the social \nfabric. It is therefore timely that a new literature is proposing an inventory that brings these \naccomplishments together in order to take stock of the question of food quality.\n1\n  \nMaybe the elusiveness of \"quality\" derives from the fact that food is both product and \nprocess. It is about exchange: food moves from producers to consumers, from wholesalers to \nretailers, from cooks to customers, and among family members. Circulation requires \ncoordination, and coordination requires codes. All of the contributions in this issue \u2013 from \nGrandi's analysis of the paramount importance of \"freshness\" in the Mantova fish market in \nthe early modern age to Nicolau and Pujol's account of the nutritional propeller causing the \nrise of cow's milk among consumer goods in Catalonia in the early twentieth century \u2013 \nprovide examples of codification. These are processes of classification that order reality and \ninfuse meaning to things as well as actions. Once elaborated, codes guide behavior. Their \nknowledge benefits actors while failure to observe them results in material as well as \nsymbolic disadvantages. But disregard of codes in order to reap some kind of immediate \nbenefit remains a temptation. Hence, our emphasis on institutions as code carriers as well as \ntheir defenders, as collectives that provide resources to complete transactions, on the one \n 2 \nhand, and enforce sanctions, on the other hand, because the threat of (unpunished) frauds puts \norder and regularity in jeopardy.  \nCodes regulating the flow of food, whether explicit or implied, proceed from different \nassumptions, and they often encapsulate divergent expectations among the participants in \nexchange: nutritional features and hedonic value may collide, and so may food safety and \nfood taxation, appearance and contents, convenience and ethical concerns. In any case, \ncoordination means prior negotiation of actors at odds with each other but committed to \nconstruct a stable foundation for their future interactions. Hence our second emphasis: \nconflict. Indeed, the genesis and demise of a product's definition \u2013 its qualification \u2013 tend to \nbe contentious. They are historically situated. Contexts matter. Hierholzer's examination of \nthe elaboration of a product standard in the German chocolate industry at the turn of the \ntwentieth century showcases branch-wide discussions that opposed large companies to small \nfirms because normalization opened some, but closed other paths of industrial development. \nWatts' study of the Parisian meat market in the eighteenth century explains the reason why \nnew medical assumptions about human digestion undermined the traditional hierarchies of \ntaste, transforming the hitherto despised beef into cuts of high repute; the ensuing increase in \ntrade, however, roused worries among French sanitary authorities about zoonotic disease.  \nNorms, standards, values: their intersecting histories lend concreteness to the process of \nproduct identification. They pinpoint the spaces in which human activity turns generic foods \ninto qualified goods. They capture the rhythms in which processes of classification happen. \nThey zoom in on definitions as well as the (anticipated) uses of things. To approach their \nelaboration avoids the pitfalls of technical reductionism while recognizing the importance of \ntechnical characteristics and the processes through which standardization takes place. In short, \nnorms, standards and values frame the conditions necessary for exchange to take place \nbecause they support and are supported by private and public institutions that provide people \nwith rules and orientation for action.  \nHere, then, emerges a research venture to shed light on the conventions that hold society \ntogether and guarantee it the necessary stability for peaceful and orderly, if not necessarily \nequitable, interaction. It contains at least four angles: to unpack the several meanings of \nquality, to set modes of qualification into their specific temporal contexts, to show the \noperations and the institutions needed to implement them, and last but not least, to uncover \nthe ways in which definitions of quality shaped not only routine interaction, but motivated on-\nthe-spot disagreement and led to prolonged formal (legal) argument. The long and the short \nterm are thus intricately linked. Customs and conventions persist in time. Contrapuntally, \n 3 \nthough, times of crises provide historians with the necessary paper trail to reconstruct the \nnorms and practices of food quality. New knowledge (Nicolau and Pujol, Watts) or new \ntechniques (Grandi, Hierholzer) shake up quality conventions and modify product definitions. \nThe late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century debates about national food and drug laws \nindicate that such incidents have quite protracted durations. Indeed, crises illustrate the deep \nhistorical roots of quality perceptions. Even putatively trivial events allow the historian to \ndisentangle the multiple layers, convergence and divergence, in the conceptions of food \nquality and the practices they induced.  \n \nButter vs. margarine: a paradigm of quality definition?  \nTake the case of margarine. In 1967 the French margarine producers sought the \ngovernment's authorization to add vitamins to their product. It seemed a perfectly reasonable \nrequest in 1967. The claimants enlisted historical experience among their arguments to prove \nthe benefits of fortification. Hadn't the British mandated just such additives for public-health \nreasons during the Second World War to bring margarine's nutritional profile up close to \nbutter's natural make-up? The partners of the French in the European Economic Community \nhad made the same case in order to prevent rickets (due to vitamin D deficiency) and \nxerophthalmia (a consequence of vitamin A deficiency). The general trend went toward \nvitamin fortification as a public strategy to prevent disease, and France appeared ever more as \nan exception. Yet it was precisely this sanitary contention that proved the application's \nAchilles heel. Examination requirements included an investigation by the Academy of \nMedicine, a standing committee of experts whose origins date back to the sixteenth century \nwhen royal authorities appointed physicians to evaluate the therapeutic and curative powers of \nwell-water. Their report relied on half a century of legal precedents. Based on a decree dated \nJune 28, 1912 that prohibited the addition of chemical substances to foods, they urged the \ngovernment to reject the petition. Any interference with a foodstuff's natural composition was \nbound to alter its characteristics, the line of reasoning held, and this particular intervention \nwould shift the modified good into the realm of pharmacopoeia. That vitamin D had a bad \nreputation in France, where it had figured on the list of dangerous substances since November \n1948, compounded the case, as did discussions about its effect on the occurrence of infantile \nhypercalcaemia in England. Fortified margarine \u2013 with a tarnished image, to boot \u2013 fell into \nthe category of \"preventative\" or \"dietetic\" foods, both of which would have to be sold in \nclearly labelled packaging at licensed pharmacies. Relegating its commerce to the \napothecary's counter came close to knocking the bottom out the market (just as fortified baby \n 4 \nformula struggled to take off in the face of opposition among paediatricians who feared \nhypervitaminosis). The French consumed roughly 1.2 kg (about three pounds) of margarine \nper head and per year in the late 1960s, while butter consumption was ten times higher. The \nprospect of a per caput consumption reduced to homeopathic doses prompted an about-turn \namong the grumbling margarine producers. They preferred a stable, if small, market to the \nperil of altogether vanishing from the scene.\n2\n  \nThe almost century-old international search for mutually exclusive \u2013 as opposed to the \nintegrated, galenian (\"Let food be thy first medicine\") \u2013 definitions of food and medicine \nshaped considerations on health and on governmental responsibility to limit a population's \nexposure to legally-defined hazardous substances. Product definition, however, did not merely \ncome down to a bundle of sanitary concerns. It immediately raised the question of a good's \nqualification to enter the market. After all, fortification aimed at closing the gap between \nbutter and margarine, between the expensive, genuine article and its cheaper surrogate \n(\"artificial butter\", as it was dubbed). Or, to put the issue in economic terms, to grant that \nmargarine was a substitute for butter. The rivalry had a long history. Margarine, an industrial \ngood, had mimicked the \"natural\", time-honored butter ever since its invention in 1869, \nindeed, it was the first industrial substitute of a food product. A legal recognition of \nsubstitutability was tantamount to lifting it up from the status of an incomplete incarnation of \nbutter, to its full expression with identical uses (and utility). It would have instituted a level \nfield of commercial competition between two equivalent products, not unlike the clash \nbetween the tropical cane and the temperate beet in the sugar market.\n3\n \nThe threat mobilized agricultural interests in Europe and North America throughout the \nlate nineteenth and the twentieth century. Thus in 1882, the short-lived French journal \nL'alimentation publique noted \"a curious detail, to wit, not consumers but agricultural \nsocieties are taking up the fight against deceitful practices which consist in selling as butter a \nproduct containing up to 80 percent margarine.\" Butter fundamentalists of all countries \ncampaigned to establish legal frames in order to segment the market. In their view, the same \nfat content did not remove the spreads' differing attributes stemming from the raw material \n(cow's milk vs. animal blubber and later vegetable oils) and work processes (churning vs. \nhydrogenation), differences which rendered the two products incommensurable and \ncomparison impossible \u2013 in the late nineteenth century as well as in 1967. To allow degrees \n(butter mixed with margarine) rather than to mandate kinds (butter on the one side, margarine \non the other) would have dealt a blow to the butter market. The 1912 discovery of Vitamin A \nin butter tilted the balance in its favor because margarine lacked the micronutrient, at least for \n 5 \nas long as the chemical and pharmaceutical industry strove to produce synthetic varieties with \nwhich to augment foodstuffs (they succeeded in the 1920s). These were momentous events, \nsince they inaugurated a new vocabulary, and then enhanced the legitimacy, of science in \npublic discourse on food and health: butter had been a \"natural\", sometimes even a \"pure\" \nproduct; now it became a nutritious, a wholesome, a protective food.\n4\n  \nIn France agricultural interests have long enjoyed privileged and permanent contacts \nwith government and public servants (and so captured at least part of policy-making), and the \nsituation could easily have persisted. The shake-up, when it came, originated from the outside, \nso to speak. It proceeded on the basis of commercial considerations. Sanitary concerns \nregarding a safe food supply had no role whatsoever when, in the 1990s, the European \nCommission enjoined France to admit fortified margarine in the interests of the free \ncirculation of all goods legally produced in the Union's member states; simultaneously, the \nCommission sent a \"reasoned opinion\" to persuade the Netherlands to open its market to \nunfortified varieties. National regulations functioned as, so the argument went, concealed \ntrade barriers. In all this, the consumer was an implied figure, not an active participant in the \ndecree. The matter came down to providing as large a choice of spreads and kitchen fats as \npossible. The protection of health, the measure assumed, remained in the hands of member \nstates: a product considered safe in one state will be safe for everyone \u2013 at least on the \ncondition of carrying a distinctive mark. Within certain boundaries, and prompted by access \nto information on the product's \"true nature\", the market was free to operate. All that was \nneeded was a label and larger distribution shelves. But note that a hybrid combining butter \nwith a butter alternative (margarine, low-fat spreads) does not exist. Rules and definitions \ninstitute the market.\n5\n  \n \nInstitutions and the definition of quality \nEven when presented in a nutshell, the butter-margarine competition yields several \nhooks on which to attach the search for insights into the meaning of quality. Of course, its \nchanging tides and the appearance of many an alternative to butter merit an ampler historical \nsweep, which might include the curious challenge to lard in the early 1900s by the once \ndiscredited cottonseed-based shortening, or the exploits of lard producers who eventually \nimitated the erstwhile imitation, blurring distinctions of branding through which they had \nearlier \u2013 and often by legal fiat \u2013 tried to eliminate their competitor.6 Even so, it appears \nclearly that product quality cannot be reduced to a food's intrinsic, inherent (one is tempted to \nsay physical) properties. Composition obviously matters, but as the example of milk grading \n 6 \nproves, a product's make-up is itself the result of prior definition. In the 1930s a French \nmanual on milk production stated the unanimous welcome given to regulation but noted that \nproblems began already with the definition of \"quality\": the mere decision on who should be \ninvolved in its elaboration proved highly political, for interests diverged already in the farm \nyard. In Germany, the legitimacy of experts in the definition of food quality was a hotly \ndebated question in the late nineteenth century.\n7\n In that sense, quality is a social construction: \nit includes considerations spanning the production process, the services and the disposal of a \nfood. When a good enters the marketplace, quite a series of technical, sanitary, nutritional, \nlegal definitions, about which many people have thought and argued, obtain prior to its \ncommercialization. When it remains in private circuits where proximity enhances trust, taste \ncriteria may precipitate the willingness to acquire a product. In both cases, food safety is \nassumed to be achieved through institutional or customary measures. This is precisely the task \ninstitutions accomplish when they \"think\" (as Mary Douglas famously asserted\n8\n): whether it \nbe the paediatricians in twentieth-century Catalonia, the Union of German Food-Producers \nand Traders in the nineteenth century, the butcher's guild in eighteenth-century Paris, the \nConduttore dei Laghi (Lakes manager) in seventeenth-century Mantova, or, as the quest for \nalternatives to butter shows, any other kind of interest group, including state administrators, \nthey think by providing direction to individuals and to groups. They enable people to act and \ntheir stability allows for a reasonably certain extrapolation of future conditions in which to \nengage in trade.  \nOur case studies show that institutional actions evolve in a force field where several \ninterests compete with each other. They struggle for the power of definition. In any case, \ninstitutions weigh in. This is not the place to investigate the conditions of collective action. \nSuffice it to note that constituted, legally recognized consumer representation in the food \nmarket appeared only toward the end of the nineteenth century. Notions of entitlement \u2013 or \nmoral economy \u2013 had underpinned and justified earlier food riots and continue to do so, but \nboycotts of goods that appeared to be morally or materially wanting dominated the tactics of \nearly consumers' or buyers' associations. In the legal battle over margarine's status, it was only \nin 1912, after the cost of living had soared for several years, that the French consumers\u201f \nleague, an early if ephemeral champion of a national office of consumer affairs, urged buyers \nto forgo dairy foods so as to curb the zeal of agricultural interest groups for legislation that \nwould make it difficult for butter substitutes (lard, vegetable oils and, of course, margarine) to \nfind their place on grocery shelves. As late as the 1930s, French consumers lacked the clout \n\"to defend their legitimate interests.\" Legal empowerment and public recognition, the two \n 7 \nbuilding blocks next to money in order for an institution or a lobby to be a contender, took a \nlong time coming.\n9\n  \nConflict and compromise are thus built-in features in the definition of quality. This in no \nway diminishes the role of taste and taste hierarchies as stakes in the struggle for the power to \ndefine goods and their social uses. The classifications of fish on the Mantova market, of meat \nin Paris and of chocolate in Germany clearly show the importance of canons of taste. The \ntaste tenets come with the pecuniary requirements of refinement, and their coalescence helped \nto brace the pecking order in society: the whiter the bread and the meat, the better they \nconveyed high status and prestige, not the least because white foods appeared \u2013 as Watts \npoints out \u2013 to require less digestive, physical work. Unsurprisingly, such a view of the world \nassigned the \"coarser\", darker varieties of bread and meat to the cruder stomachs of the plebs. \nSocial judgment hit margarine, too. Its industrial origin caused a variety of trouble. At least \ninitially it suffered from the perception as a poor gustatory and organoleptic imitation of \nbutter, a prejudice that debilitated its claim to full-blown equivalence with butter. The \nindexation of foods in terms of the social order highlights their symbolic quality and the \nharnessing of organoleptic properties to social judgment and classification. Its analysis \ncontributes to an explanation of styles of consumption because it examines the identification \nof foods with their consumers' status precisely because it locates or inscribes consumption in \ncontexts that provide it with meaning to contemporaries as well as historians.\n10\n  \nAbove all, conflict pitted different interest groups (including arbiters of good taste) \nagainst each other, and outcomes depended on their relations of power and capacity for \ninfluence. Degrees, then, are matters of appreciation. Appreciation implies arbitration, and \narbitration inevitably solicits experts. Hence the presence of officials to enforce standards in \nthe food market, whether they be members of guilds, professional associations or public \nadministrations: market places function because of third parties not involved in exchange. \nWhat changed over time was the form and content of expertise. Not that practical knowledge \ndisappeared. Retailers still carry the burden \u2013 and in some cases, the legal responsibility \u2013 of \nquality warranty without direct access to laboratory instruments. Sensory appreciation of \nmerchandise (color, crunch, flavor, odor, texture...) continues to matter until this day when \nhands-on knowledge and connoisseurs' advice influence price-making in many high-end food \nmarkets. The education of veterinarians has dramatically changed since the eighteenth \ncentury, and yet members of the profession continue to control hygiene in the meat-\nproduction chain, from artificial insemination through slaughtering and distribution, with a \ncombination of on-the-ground experience and scientifically tested knowledge.\n11\n  \n 8 \nThe rise of scientific foodstuff analyses and the professionalization of industrial \nchemistry dislocated, but did not obliterate such know-how. The consequence was two-fold. \nNew insights and techniques helped \"norm\" foodstuffs by breaking them down into \ncomponents that allowed quantitative comparisons: macronutrients moved beyond fish, meat, \nchocolate and milk to carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n12\n This gain in scientific knowledge of \nthe human metabolism left no place for the \"flavor principle\" but, as the German chocolate \nindustry learned in the late nineteenth century, much space for discussion on the authentic \ngood. After all, humans consume foods, not nutrients. Purity, in short, had snob appeal before \ntechnical progress and rising disposable incomes transformed cocoa consumption into a rather \nmore trivial experience.\n13\n Or is it ? The dynamics of diffusion require analysis, and Nicolau \nand Pujol move forward in that direction by illustrating the role of nutritional \nrecommendations and medical experts in sustaining the increase in a product's per caput \nconsumption. Why such advice seems to fail in the face of what is now called the obesity \nepidemic is another question. Note that dietary concerns surfaced in the soccer club in \nprovincial Stein am Rhein (Switzerland) during the early 1950s when a physician \nrecommended clear bouillon made from Maggi cubes to restore the players' physical \ncondition because the potion contained salts lost through perspiration. Nothing came of that \nsuggestion, but the inquiry alludes not only to the quite precocious, if fleeting concern with \nnutrition in local sports, but also hints at the importance of collective actors in the diffusion of \ninformation on, and the inculcation (or rejection) of new food habits. At present, whole milk \nconsumption is accused of bearing its share in children's rising body weights. It is by no \nmeans surprising to see New York schools tinkering with their canteens' menus, from which \nAmerica's erstwhile perfect food has disappeared, to be replaced with skimmed milk. With \nuncertain success: does acquired taste trump health, and if so, is indulgence for short-term \nenjoyment going to outwit the quest for longevity?\n14\n  \nThe conundrum goes beyond individual values. It hints at norms, their internalization, \nand the sanctions associated with transgression. The price of fun is a shorter life, statistically \nspeaking. When it comes to food quality, the gamut of penalties for breaking conventions runs \nlarge. Again, institutions \u2013 public and private \u2013 have played a significant role in the \nenforcement of norms. They often combined efforts to monitor behavior in markets and to \nmete out punishment for default.\n15\n The four articles in this issue offer examples of \nsurveillance, but this is clearly an area in which to push research: how did agreements and \ncontracts emerge, how were disputes solved; what were the consequences for dealers and their \ntrade in general; what can we learn about the uses of quality definitions in contested everyday \n 9 \ntransactions? While these are open questions, let's not forget that immediacy distinguished \ncommercial relations in daily provisioning: networks often enhance trust, and long-term \nrelationships between retailers and customers contribute to faith in an economic actor's \nhonesty. This observation holds especially for food purchases, where, for many reasons \nincluding difficulty in preservation and storage, regular spot transactions between \nfishmongers, butchers, cowkeepers, bakers, grocers, etc. prevailed until well into the twentieth \ncentury. Repeat purchases were often based on credit, the attribution of which relied on a \nclient's local reputation. The proverbial corner store was a nodal point in the configuration of \nrelations in the neighborhood. It provided social and economic services in the district, \nintegrating and defining it.\n16\n Yet just as membership in guilds certified to integrity but did not \nprevent free riders from betraying the honor code, so did embeddedness in neighborhood ties \nfail to stop cheating from happening: storekeepers who fell short of living up to quantity, \nquality or price expectations often became targets of crowd attacks. Face-to-face relations did \nnot guarantee utter transparency and regular gentlemanly conduct in the food business.\n17\n  \n \nMarket efficiency vs. consumer safety  \nThe four articles in this issue expose two major axes along which contentions occurred \nand spilled over into more formalized, even legally-binding regulatory activity: they are \nmarket efficiency and public health. The recent European denouement in the on-going \nnational fracas over butter and margarine indicates that the mediation between the two \ndimensions boils down to the question of whether wider supply \u2013 more choice! \u2013 increases the \nconsumer's risk of exposure to baleful effects. It cuts both ways: are cheaper goods less safe? \nDo stricter product specifications exclude poorer consumers from consumption? Food \nmarkets thus represent a particularly striking example of the tension between safety and \nefficiency norms, so much so that these two dimensions at times absorb other parameters (like \ntaste).  \nPublic policies derive directly from these emphases on safety, on the one hand, or on \nopportunity, on the other. Their institutional realisation takes place via product certification or \nconsumer information. Acceptable solutions vary: Americans seem to prefer margarine for \nprecisely the reason invoked by the French to spurn it (margarine seems to have upstaged \nbutter as the \"healthier\" spread among American consumers). Guilds staked their reputation \non product guarantees. Their obligations to, and responsibility for, food safety justified their \nprivileges; in Mantova as well as Paris and elsewhere, an important say in control and the \norganization of the market figured highly among these perquisites. Nowadays good \n 10 \nworkmanship and traditional, locally transmitted craft skills sustain claims for a product's \nunique, typical flavor, that is its achievement of the full expression of an organoleptic \npotential otherwise lost in the industrial maelstrom.\n18\n  \nIndustrialization supplied more homogeneous goods whose fabrication on conveyor \nbelts according to precise standards enhanced human capacity to monitor the processes of \nproduction and the products. It improved market efficiency. Yet, as the example of the \nGerman chocolate industry illustrates, this technological and managerial achievement to \nproduce constant quality came with worries about the imperative to cut production costs. \nCheap ersatz ingredients or additives to mask unsightly aspects had adverse effects. Some \namong them not only affected the goods' organoleptic characteristics, but threatened \nconsumers' health. The behavior of a small number of reckless producers can threaten the \nexistence of their very market since loss of trust in the merchandise may stop consumers from \nbuying them. In the case of food, measures and regulations to preserve the public's health are \nthus often tightly linked with the objective of market efficiency. Not without recalling the \nintricacies of the butter-margarine competition, the case of preservatives shows just how \ncomplicated, and thus contestable, arbitration is. The elimination of chemical stabilizers \ncauses more spoilage, resulting in material losses and inducing a concomitant price hike that \nmay deprive poorer consumers and even lead to social stigmatization. Their negative effects \non consumers' health may not justify general prohibition but rather warrant targeted \nproscription (in canteens and cafeterias, for example). Or would warning labels suffice to \ninform and protect consumers?\n19\n  \nThe argument about the industry's negative effects on taste does not hold everywhere, of \ncourse. In 1906, the French gourmet magazine Cordon bleu welcomed the arrival of perpetual \npastry ovens that baked \"6000 delicious and democratic cakes\" per hour (out went artisanal \nskill as a requisite for culinary achievements). More generally, it is worth remembering that \nthe industrialization of milk conditioning, especially pasteurization and sterilization, did much \nto improve the safety of fluid-milk supplies. The technology also tended to reduce the variety \nof organoleptic characteristics of cheese and butter because it standardizes milk as a raw \nmaterial. It thus removed local peculiarities so important to typical products, but we do well to \nrecollect that it was the creation of centralized, often cooperative butter-making plants that \nenhanced the reputation of certain areas as butter producers: the Bresse region in eastern \nFrance built its success in the interwar years precisely on such an organizational structure.\n20\n  \nSuch convolutions yield other astonishing discoveries that chip away at conventional \nwisdom. Product quality and its definition do not move into a specific direction; there's no \n 11 \nunfolding blueprint. Take freshness. Early-modern Mantova relied on a peculiar system of \nlabelling in its fish market to inform customers: the day's catch remained whole, the day after \ntails got cut off to signal that the product was past its best. Now ponder the lack, by the mid-\ntwentieth century, of a standard for product freshness in the United States. Mandatory liability \nand standardized labelling, among others, were part of the regulatory arsenal early on, and \nwhen German chocolate manufacturers used a quality mark to signal their products' purity, \ntheir approach to consumer confidence almost elevated Italian city governments into policy \nancestors.\n21\n  \nThe tensions between the concerns for hygiene and for smooth commerce in food \nmarkets are a matter of degree, not of absolute, insuperable kind. No competent authority \nwould want provisioning to deliver insalubrious goods that endanger lives but policy-makers \nwill always evaluate the cost of prohibition on the economy. However, extreme conditions \nlike wars impose policies of restriction that diminish general enjoyment of life while \nenhancing the status of ersatz products. Saccharin, for example, which was synthesized in the \nlate 1870s then led an uphill struggle against sugar and the powerful sugar lobbies, made a \ngreat deal of headway during the First World War when battlefields in Europe coincided for \nyears with areas of sugar beet culture. The Second World War compelled Stein am Rhein's \nsoccer club to substitute cheap saccharin for the energy-rich, but expensive sugar in its half-\ntime herbal tea; no mention survives on how this switch affected the game and the players' \nmorale, a crucial question since it pertains to a consumer reaction: did they drink the \nartificially sweetened beverage ? They may have preferred an unsweetened drink or \nsomething altogether different. Whatever the attitude, it is clear that they did not take a \npermanent liking to \"light\" tea. When rationing subsided and prices came down, sugar went \nback into the thirst-quencher.\n22\n  \nHistoriography has it that legal product definitions, assorted with public and industrial \nlaboratories, increased product safety.\n23\n But did they reduce frauds and falsifications; did they \nprevent betrayal of consumer trust? The somewhat whiggish argument implies that the fear of \npenal sanctions (from monetary penalties to imprisonment and the loss of a commercial \nlicence) insured compliance. There are, however, indications that the search for loopholes in \nthe legal framework, as well as the incentives to shirk customary or contractual obligations, \ncontinue to motivate economic actors. American observers were apparently divided over the \ninterpretation of the astonishing number of litigations concerning foodstuffs in the 1930s: had \ndeceptive practices increased or were overactive commercial jurisdictions striving to establish \ntheir legitimacy? In Britain litigation over food quality, especially alleged adulteration, grew \n 12 \nto be a small industry during the second half of the nineteenth century.\n24\n Recent events \u2013 just \nas the search for cheap or healthier butter substitutes since the invention of margarine or the \nuse of maize to extract sucrose as a replacement of beet or cane sugar \u2013 appear to prove the \nboundlessness of human ingenuity to produce profits... and to circumvent rules and \nregulations. Emulation and improvement are the springs of innovation. They also test, and \ntend to disrupt, food quality definitions; hence the continued push toward new regulatory \nmeasures and institutional adjustment. \nTime is a fundamental variable in the elaboration of quality norms and their \nimplementation. The scope of an area where rules apply depends on the extent and the \ncomplexity of bureaucracies. Administrations develop in response to problems or \nopportunities and in correlation to technical capabilities or limitations. Capabilities for \ncommunication certainly enhance efficiency and their ever-increasing speed certainly \ncontributes to the expanding scale of regulatory intervention. And yet, the pertinent level of \nhistorical analysis needs reflection and argument: the Roman empire or commercial networks \nin the Middle Ages may form the relevant context, just as the towns of Grenoble or M\u00fcnster \nor the province of Catalonia may yield more insight into \"quality\" as an organizing principle \nof everyday life than a bird's eye view through the spectrum of the nation-state. Different \nscopes of norms and practices co-exist in time. While efforts were made centrally to impose a \nsingle nomenclature of meat cuts and their quality in France in the second half of the \nnineteenth century and indeed succeeded in this project of normalization, local customs still \nprevail over these norms in the ranking of the different pieces.\n25\n  \n \nTime, space and quality: research venues \nWhat are the engines that move changes in the valuation of a good's attributes? What \naccounts for the multiple forms of quality definitions? How do they coexist? The four papers \nprovide examples and venues for further research. Medical concerns certainly sustained the \ngrowth of milk consumption since the eighteenth century.\n26\n Arguments in its favor changed \nover time, however, and the register switched from its therapeutic to preventative uses. The \nacceptability of beef, too, got a boost when physiologists improved their understanding of \ndigestion. The process of qualification via medical knowledge modified neither product in its \nintrinsic nature. And yet, medical expectations influenced the appreciation of leaner meats in \nthe long run in France (the \"manly\" red, too, lost some of its appeal \u2013 but in the United \nStates), a factor that, combined with changing cooking techniques, sustained the development \ntoward less fatty meat cuts in the French market, where stew went into decline when steak and \n 13 \nroast became standard fare. While the trajectory of dietary advice, the channels through which \nit travels, and its appropriation by individual and collective consumers requires further \nresearch, it is tempting to broach the hypothesis that the medical impulses affected the entire \nsupply chain, starting with consumers and moving back to the producers. Information pushed \nproduction.  \nThe opposite movement, the one which currently excites much commentary, pertains to \ntechnical developments that make claims on product quality. Industrial transformation \nproceeds most efficiently with homogeneous raw materials. Hence the early industrialization \nof flour and oil milling, sugar processing or salting fish, sectors in which standardized \nproducts largely predominate. Heterogeneous inputs slow the mechanization and automation \nof food production because human hands are needed to sort and, in the case of meat and fish \nfor example, to clean. The fabrication of sardine and tuna cans has been particularly labour \nintensive for precisely this reason, and since salaries always appear compressible, these \nindustries hire women to perform the repetitive tasks (men carry out the work in the red-meat \nindustry, poultry remaining in the hands of women). Productivity growth \u2013 and the \nelimination of human labour from the production line \u2013 thus required the standardization of \nraw materials. Regular dimensions enhance their aptitude for industrial transformation on the \nconveyor belt. Long before the efforts to extend the shelf lives of possibly spotless fruit and \nvegetables, requirements for their optimal industrial preservation as tinned foods led to \nresearch and experiments to achieve regular dimensions (to avoid frequent human \nmanipulation of raw material and machinery) and fixed consistencies (to withstand the \napplication of pressure). Botanists and gardeners in early-modern Europe had striven to \nincrease the number of varieties. In the twentieth century standards became a concern in the \nsupply chain, their genesis and implementation aimed to coordinate and smooth food \nprocessing. The European Community, for example, mandated the sizes of commercial apples \nand pears by 1971, an injunction that contributed to the reduction of the number of fruit \nvarieties in the market. While genetic manipulation arouses much interest and debate, the \nearly history of raw-food standardization and its effects on supply remains little-known. Here \nis a paradox to explore: technology may have debilitated taste and reduced choice, but \ncontributed to a supply that was plentiful and sanitary (if sanitized). Technology tilted taste.\n27\n \nPlace matters, and the relation of quality and location of production requires \ninvestigation. Local resources like soil, animal species and plant varieties, fodder and their \nknowledgeable orchestration by local artisans combine, in the minds of many consumers, to \nmake the reputations of a wide variety of products to be marketed beyond the areas of \n 14 \nproduction. Didn't Brillat-Savarin notoriously insist that there were only three regions to \nproduce decent poultry? The equation also holds for raw material. French industrial pasta \nproducers valued durum wheat from the Ukraine and Northern Africa, and they used such \ngeographic references as marketing strategies.\n28\n While the historical literature on terroir \ndesignations and labelling is growing,\n29\n historians could take a cue from geographers and \ntrace a good's itinerary and transformation from the soil or the water to the plate and beyond. \nSuch research would not only establish patterns of provisioning and scrutinize production \nchains (from the social relations of labor to work's impact on the environment, to industrial \norganization, marketing and consumption), but focus on how quality conventions are \nestablished, enter into the trade equation and help determine commercial interaction down to \nthe disposal of food waste. It is an approach that is open to studying the material culture of \nfood, linking geographic inscription and changing forms and uses, relations that warrant \nmapping out over the longer term.\n30\n  \nConventions, legislation and regulation yield important insights into the social \nconstruction of quality. But what if agreements, contracts and law decrees are disregarded? \nThe contingent circumstances of litigation in local courts are likely to offer a window on the \nsocial experience of quality. However much legal action was beyond the reach of many \nconsumers, court cases yield evidence on the everyday understanding \u2013 the codes \u2013 of food \nquality. Research in legal archives as well as trade publications is likely to uncover the \ncreative appropriations of norms, their transformation in quotidian practices. As yet, we have \nlittle idea how such \u201eknowledge\u201f of the practical limits of quality played out and one suspects \nthat a comparative history would show substantially different stories according to national \ntradition and jurisdiction.  \nThe empirical studies in this issue tackle the different aspects of quality and its \ndefinition. They look at product integrity from a variety of angles. They pay attention to \nnorms and practices. They zoom in on institutions but introduce us to the odours and the \nnoises in the market place and in the factory. It seems that there is boundless scope for further \nhistorical work, and that such research is important for an understanding of what, at the \nmoment, are taken-for-granted aspects of our food supply. Historical evidence is often \nparticular, but as studies of the role of freshness in fish markets, of health in the meat trade, of \ncomposition in chocolate production, and nutritional concerns in milk consumption move \nbeyond the specific case to move us closer to an understanding of \"food quality\" in the \norganization of society. And so they provide a basis for theorizing food quality.  \n 15 \nNotes  \n \n1\n Christopher Ritson, Richard Hutchins, \"Supply and food availability,\" in David Marshall (ed.), Food Choice \nand the Consumer (London, 1995), 34.
