Replacing coastal habitats is \nimportant given the high level of ecosystem service they \ncan provide (Costanza et al. 1997) and has become the \nfocus of efforts to develop ecosystem-based management \nand restoration strategies. Particular attention has been \ngiven to the restoration of salt marshes to provide nursery \nhabitats for fishes, nutrient and sediment sinks and coast-\nline protection (Colclough et al. 2005; Moller & Spencer \n2002; Shepherd et al. 2005). Since the early 1990s, restor-\ning tidal inundation to formerly reclaimed land, either \nthrough a breach in current coastal defences or whole \nscale embankment removal (managed realignment) has \nbeen increasingly used throughout Europe as a cost ef-\nfective and sustainable response to biodiversity loss and \nflood management (French 2006). Self-sustaining plant \ncommunities are often a primary goal of such restora-\ntion efforts as they perform many of the biological and \neconomically desirable functions of wetland ecosystems \nand are the most common performance standard (Gopal \n& Mitsch 1995; Moller et al. 1999; Sullivan 2001; van \nAndel 1998; Zedler & Lindig-Cisneros 2000). \nThe successful restoration of plant communities \ndepends on the availability of target species and suit-\nable abiotic conditions (Bakker et al. 1996). Restoring \nhydrological functioning is often assumed to be suffi-\ncient for wetland communities to develop on previously \nreclaimed land (Mauchamp et al. 2002) where regular \ninundation provides the main dispersal agent for the \ndelivery of diaspores to restoration sites. The avail-\nability and dispersal of target species may however, be \na bottleneck for successful re-assembly and despite the \npotential for long-distance transport by tidal water there \nis a predominance for local dispersal in coastal settings \n(Huiskes et al. 1995; Middleton 1999; Sengupta et al. \n2005; Wolters et al. 2005a). Re-colonisation may also be \n2 garbuTT, a. & WolTers, m.\ndelayed by unsuitable hydrological and edaphic condi-\ntions that facilitate plant species establishment (Onain-\ndia et al. 2001). Wetland communities are particularly \nsusceptible to colonisation by invasive plant species as \nthey act as \u2018landscape sinks\u2019 that accumulate materials \nfrom both terrestrial and wetland disturbances (Zedler \n& Kercher 2004). Invading alien species in wetlands \noften form mono-specific stands at the expense of native \nspecies and restoration sites that experience large scale \ndisturbances on implementation are particularly vulner-\nable. Competition for space and the more complete use \nof resources in diverse communities is thought to make \nthem more resistant to invasion than simple communities. \nBy capturing more resources and using them more ef-\nficiently diverse communities leave lower nutrient levels \navailable for invading species. Diverse communities also \nhave a higher probability of containing species that are \nhighly competitive for limited resources and can drive \nout invasive species (Symstad 2000). The ability of a \nrestored community to resist invasion by alien species \nis an important measure of successful restoration (Cairns \n1988; Ewel 1987) and achieving similar species richness \nto that of target communities an important goal. \nThe creation of coastal wetlands is a long-term proc-\ness (Simenstad & Thom 1996) and it can take many years \nfor restored salt marshes to develop plant communities \nsimilar to those in natural habitats (Garbutt et al. 2006; \nWolters et al. 2005b). To date, timescales for ecosystem \nreplacement have been based on spatial comparisons \nbetween restored coastal wetlands of differing ages, often \nless than 20 years old (Morgan & Short 2002). To over-\ncome this, salt marshes that regenerated on abandoned \nland following storm breaches of coastal defences have \nbeen used as natural analogues for salt marsh develop-\nment. Such abandoned reclamations have been used to \nassess sedimentary responses to the breaching of coastal \ndefences (Cundy et al. 2002; French et al. 1999; French \n1999) and to validate models on sedimentary processes \nin natural salt marshes (Allen 2000). They have been \nused to study the effect of time on natural regeneration \nof salt marshes in relation to edaphic factors (Onaindia \net al. 2001) and to provide general information on the \ndesign and management of restoration schemes (Burd \n1992). Wolters et al. (2005b) compared the success of \nsalt marsh restoration schemes based on the richness of \ntarget species of several accidental and deliberate de-\nembankment sites across north-west Europe. However, \nlength of time taken for a regenerated marsh to achieve \nequivalent plant community composition to that of natu-\nral marshes is largely unknown (Havens et al. 2002).\nIn this study we compare the vegetation structure \nand composition of salt marsh restoration sites and \nabandoned reclamations to that of adjacent natural \ncommunities. Our main objectives were to determine \nwhether: (1) the plant community composition of \nnaturally regenerated salt marshes resembles that of \nnatural salt marshes and (2) over what timescale. These \nsites are used as analogues for modern day restoration \nefforts and provide a chronosequence of salt marsh \ndevelopment on formerly embanked agricultural land. \nThe study compares species richness, abundance, sward \nheight, fit of the regenerated marshes to British National \nVegetation Communities (NVC) and similarity to refer-\nence conditions. \nMaterial and Methods\nStudy sites\nThe Essex Estuaries European Marine Site com-\nprises the major estuaries of the Colne, Blackwater, \nCrouch and Roach plus extensive areas of tidal flats in \nsouth-east England, UK. The area is a relatively unde-\nveloped estuary complex with a wide range of typical \nestuarine and marine communities. Most of the salt \nmarshes are backed by earth or concrete embankments. \nThere has been significant erosion in the past as a result \nof coastal squeeze and coastal management (Cooper \net al. 2001) and changes in climatic patterns (van \nder Wal & Pye 2004). The region is regularly used to \ndemonstrate the effectiveness of managed realignment \nboth in the implementation of realignment schemes \nand theoretical modelling (Anon. 2004; Pethick 1998; \nShepherd et al. 2005). \nWe surveyed 14 abandoned reclamations and four \nmanaged realignment sites (all referred to hereafter as \nde-embankment sites) along the Essex coast during \nJuly 2004 (Fig. 1). The embankments of the oldest \nsites were breached during a storm in 1897 and the \nyoungest (by managed realignment) in 2002, giving a \nchronosequence of salt marsh development on former \nagricultural land from 2 - 107 years (Table 1). Data on \nthe time of breach and physical characteristics of the \nsites for the abandoned reclamations were comprehen-\nsively reviewed by Burd (1992). Data on breaching and \nphysical characteristics of the managed realignment \nsites are described in Environment Agency (Anon. \n1999, 2003); Dagely (1995) and Reading et al. (2002). \nThere is no history of livestock grazing or management \nat any of the study sites. \nExperimental design\nSuccessful restoration of plant communities depends \non the availability of target species and the presence \nof favourable environmental conditions that allow the \nspecies to germinate and establish. Target species can \n- The naTural regeneraTion of salT marsh on formerly reclaimed land - 3\ncolonise a restoration site from several sources with \ndispersal from the local species pool being the most \nimportant (Wolters et al. 2005a). In this study the natu-\nral salt marshes adjacent to the de-embankment sites, \nonly separated by the remains of the old embankment \nand connected by the same creek network, were used \nto identify the target species and plant communities. \nAll 18 de-embankment sites surveyed had natural salt \nmarsh directly adjacent allowing for a pair-wise com-\nparison at each site.\nThe marshes of the study region occupy a range \n0.25 - 0.65 m below mean high water tides dominated \nby the Puccinellietum maritimae and Atriplex portu-\nlacoidis salt marsh communities (Boorman 1992). In \norder to characterise the vegetation, five 2-m2 quadrats \nwere located along a 100-m transect placed at the same \nelevation (\u00b1 0.01 m) within the de-embankment site \nas that of the adjacent reference marsh using a laser \ntheodolite. The elevation was selected by determining \nthe range of the natural reference marsh by topographic \nsurvey, then selecting an elevation at random. Elevation \ndiffered between the 18 de-embankment sites. Transects \nwere stratified into five 20-m lengths, with one quadrat \nplaced at random within each 20-m length to avoid any \nperiodicity that might be found in the vegetation (e.g. \ndue to ridges and runnels that reflected old agricultural \nsystems). Transects were placed parallel to the em-\nbankment and were centred on the original breach in \nthe seawall. Where there were several breaches in the \noriginal embankment at a site, transects were centred \non a breach identified at random. Elevation was used \nas a surrogate for tidal inundation to ensure that the \nplant communities within the de-embankment sites and \nreference marshes received equivalent submergence \nfrequencies, and was checked by observing the depth \nand extent of the incoming tide for each site. No dif-\nferences were observed. \nVegetation monitoring\nSpecies presence and an estimate of percentage \ncover by eye were recorded for each quadrat. Ad-\nditional species present along the 100-m transect but \nnot recorded in the five quadrats were also recorded \nby direct searching and given an abundance score us-\ning a subjective five point scale from dominant to rare \n(DAFOR; Kent & Coker 1992). \nThe five quadrats sampling 10% of the total transect \nlength were found to be an effective method of charac-\nterising the vegetation at a given elevation. None of the \ntransects had more than one additional species recorded \noutside the quadrats and where additional species were \npresent they were recorded as \u2018rare\u2019 (representing a \nsingle plant or tussock of vegetation). These data were \nnot used in the analysis.\nFive measurements of vegetation height were taken \nat each quadrat location by placing a hand lightly on \nthe vegetation at the level below which ca. 80% of \nthe vegetation is estimated by eye to be growing (thus \nignoring occasional tall stalks) then reading this height \nwith a ruler after Stewart et al. (2001). \nStatistical analysis\nLinear regression analysis was used to describe \nthe relationship between changes in species richness \nover time in the chronosequence. Where there was a \nsignificant relationship between species richness over \ntime, the time-scale for embanked salt marshes to have \nsimilar species richness to natural marshes (species rich-\nness equivalence) was estimated using the regression \nequation. In addition, the relationship between species \nrichness, site area and the length of time the former \nmarshes were reclaimed were also analysed. A paired \nt-test was used to test for significant differences in spe-\ncies richness and sward height between de-embankment \nsites and their adjacent reference marsh using the mean \nof the five quadrats in each transect.\nThe vegetation of the de-embankment sites and \nreference marshes were compared with all other Brit-\nish Plant Communities as described by the National \nFig. 1.

This \nprovided a measure of the \u2018goodness-of-fit\u2019 of each de-\nembankment community to its adjacent reference marsh. \nIn addition, the similarity between the vegetation of the \nde-embanked sites and reference marshes was quantified \nusing S\u00f8renson\u2019s Index (Kent & Coker 1992). \nA mixed model with Wards test was used to test \nfor differences in species richness, cover and vegeta-\ntion height between the de-embankment and reference \nmarshes with location as a random factor using the mean \nof the five quadrats. Species with very low cover values \n(< 0.5 %) were not included in the analysis. Means for \npercentage fit to the NVC and similarity using S\u00f8ren-\nson\u2019s Index were compared using one-way ANOVA with \nF -test. Models were fitted using the method of residual \nmaximum likelihood (REML) using the statistical pack-\nage Genstat 6. \nTable 1.

For differences between reference and de-embankment marsh for species richness \nper quadrat and sward height a paired t-test was used; levels of significant differences are indicated by asterisks (*P < 0.05; ** P < \n0.01; *** P < 0.001; ns = not significant). \u2020 indicates a managed realignment site. \nResults\nPlant species\nOf the 18 paired sites surveyed, 13 de-embankment \nsites had fewer species than their adjacent reference \nmarsh, three had an equal number and two had more \n(Table 1). 17 halophytes were recorded during the survey \n(Table 2), all typical species of the region.

The 0-50 year \nold sites and 51-100 year old sites had fewer species per \nquadrat than the 101+ year sites and the reference salt \nmarshes (Table 3). There was a weak relationship in the \ndifference in species richness between de-embankment \nsites and reference marshes and the time since the sites \nwere first re-exposed to tidal inundation (Fig. 2).

Taller vegetation was mainly recorded \nwithin the de-embankment sites (Table 1) as a result of \na positive correlation between increasing sward height \nwith the greater abundance of Spartina anglica (R2 = \n65.6%; p < 0.001). \nDiscussion\nWhile it is generally assumed that given enough time, \nsalt marsh vegetation and other functional indicators will \nresemble those of natural marshes (Zedler & Callaway \n1999), we found that after more than 100 years, regener-\nated salt marshes in Essex differed in plant community \ncomposition. The vegetation communities of the regen-\nerated salt marshes within the de-embanked sites were, \nin general, representative of less diverse communities \nor those typical of a lower zone in the natural marshes \nwith a higher tidal influence. Seeds of salt marsh plants \nare predominantly dispersed over short distances and \ncolonisation of de-embankment sites probably occurs \nvia stepping-stones (Wolters et al. 2005a) and the lack \nof continuous ecosystems along the coast can delay the \nre-colonisation process (Onaindia & Amezaga 1999). \nSeed limitation is unlikely to restrict colonisation in the \npresent study however, where natural marshes occurred \nadjacent to every site with connecting creeks. It is per-\nhaps surprising that, given the low levels of plant species \ndiversity found in the salt marsh flora differences were \ndetectable over such long timescales. This suggests that \nthe vegetation communities may be relatively static or \nthat severe disturbances are rare. Seedling recruitment \nin salt marsh communities is generally precluded in \ndense vegetation by competition from adults, but it is \nalso relatively rare in disturbance generated space due \nto high soil salinities (Shumway & Bertness 1992). If the \nvegetation within the de-embankment sites is relatively \nstatic there may be little opportunities for new species \nto colonise. \nThe distribution of plant species on salt marshes \nis a balance between tolerance and competition (Gray \n1985) and it appears that within the de-embankment \nsites this has not yet been achieved. This could be due \nto the greater abundance of Spartina anglica recorded \nwithin the salt marshes of the de-embankment sites. The \nsuccessful establishment and spread of this neoendemic \nthroughout the UK during the last century has been well \ndocumented and was largely due to the species\u2019 rapid \nTable 3.

Spartina anglica was \nfirst recorded in the study region in 1924 (Jermyn 1974) \nand the mudflats or developing salt marsh communities \nof the de-embankment sites would have been highly \nsusceptible to invasion. Spartina anglica can drastically \nalter the sedimentary and drainage characteristics of its \nsurroundings leading to the creation of waterlogged and \nanoxic soils (Doody 1984). In addition, soils undergo \nfundamental changes when reclaimed and subsequently \nre-exposed to tidal inundation by de-embankment (Ha-\nzelden & Boorman 2001) and re-colonisation may be \ndelayed by unsuitable hydrological and edaphic condi-\ntions that facilitate plant species establishment (Onain-\ndia et al. 2001). The water dynamics of the salt marsh \nsub-surface exerts a fundamental control on vegetation \npatterns, determining the potential for aerobic respiration \nand the ability of plant species to tolerate local condi-\ntions (Silvestri et al. 2005). This may account for the \ndifferences in species richness and abundance between \nthe more moisture tolerant, species poor Salicornia euro-\npaea, Spartina anglica, Aster tripolium and Puccinellia \nmaritima communities within the de-embankment sites \nand the dominance of the more moisture sensitive A. \nportulacoides communities in the reference marshes. \nWater dynamics or competition is likely to contribute to \nthe exclusion of Armeria maritima, Plantago maritima \nand Spartina maritima from the de-embankment sites. \nAdditional surveys of the abiotic characteristics of sites \nare required and experimental reciprocal transplants of \n\u2018rare\u2019 species should be undertaken to clarify this.\nThe greater abundance of S. anglica in the de-em-\nbankment sites, and in particularly the younger sites, re-\nflects not only the species\u2019 invasive habit but questions the \nability of the regenerated marshes to \u2018function\u2019 in a way \nthat reflects a reference system. Restoration theory at-\ntempts to set criteria from which success can be measured, \nsuch as composition, sustainability, biotic interactions \nand nutrient retention (Zedler 2001). Globally, Spartina \nspecies are the most widespread invasive genera in salt \nmarshes (Zedler & Adam 2002) and can fundamentally \nalter the composition and structure of invaded marshes \n(Callaway & Josselyn 1992; Spicher & Josselyn 1985). \nDifferences in sward height and cover can also cause \nproblems for wildlife habitat for native species such as \nbreeding birds and insects (Middleton 1999; Zedler & \nCallaway 1999). The greater cover values and strong \nrelationship between sward height and cover suggests \nS. anglica is responsible for the structural differences \nbetween the de-embanked and reference marshes. \nCreated salt marshes should ideally function within \nthe normal variation found in natural marshes, thereby \nretaining key attributes (Atkinson et al. 2004), such as \ndiversity, vegetation structure and ecological processes \n(Ruiz-Jaen & Aide 2005). Experience from current \nrestoration efforts has shown that with relatively little \nmanagement, intertidal mudflats will develop and if \nthe elevation is suitable salt marsh plants will colonise \n(Garbutt et al. 2006). The present study provides further \nevidence that, contrary to recent claims (Hughes & \nParamor 2004), it is possible for salt marshes to develop \non reclaimed land and to persist as recognisable salt \nmarsh communities. However, even after 100 years, salt \nmarshes that regenerated within de-embankment sites \ndiffer in species richness, composition and structure from \nreference communities. This may be a result of differing \nabiotic conditions and higher cover of S. anglica. Ad-\nditional research is required to identify the constraints to \nsalt marsh re-assembly on formerly reclaimed land with \nparticular attention to the abiotic conditions. \nWhether the de-embankment sites are any less valu-\nable for nature conservation or ecosystem function in \ntheir own right should be considered. The sites contain \ntypical salt marsh communities and the most frequent \nvegetation community, the SM13 Puccinellietum mar-\nitimae is wide spread in the region. The Puccinellietum \nmaritimae and Atriplex portulacoidis vegetation units \nof the natural reference marshes are adjacent in the \nzonation sequence within the regions salt marshes and \nboth contained a similar cover of Puccinellia maritima \n(> 30%) through the survey. It may be that from a \nfunctional aspect they are not that different. Similarity \n(S\u00f8rensen\u2019s) between the de-embankment and reference \nmarshes, especially through the middle age class, is \nrelatively high. The similarity between de-embankment \nand reference marshes decreases towards the end of the \nchronosequence, possibly because of more stochastic \nprocesses that lead to the dominance of one or more \nspecies. Even so, typical salt marsh communities are still \npresent. Because salt marshes and estuarine systems are \nsubject to severe disturbance through storm events it may \nbe unrealistic to expect a smooth successional trajectory \nover a specified time period to produce a typical end point. \nThe results presented here should not be interpreted as \nthe inevitable failure of salt marsh creation schemes in \nmatching reference conditions, but as a cautionary note \nthat in fact, restoration efforts may never fully replace \nnatural wetland functions. \n8 garbuTT, a. & WolTers, m.\nAcknowledgements.
