The concern of political scientists and reformers is that the\npresence of communist era elites in the post-Soviet regime, which have retained their\ncore values and recirculated into positions of power, may be a significant obstacle to the\nconsolidation of democracy and a market economy. While the communist system\ndisintegrated with surprising rapidity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is not clear\nwhether the norms internalised by elites operating under the \u2018command-administrative\u2019\nsystem have changed along with the political system or whether the values and\nassumptions of the old pattern of government continue to be influential.\nThere is broad acceptance that there is a pattern of continuity between the old Soviet\nnomenklatura and post-communist ruling elites, but wide disagreement over the scale\nand impact of turnover. Studies of elites in Russia generally analyse how continuity,\ncirculation or turnover of ruling elites affects the prospects for transition by drawing a\nmajor distinction between the reproduction of old elites, which maintain values and may\nbe a factor for stability, continuity and, perhaps, stagnation, and the circulation into\npower of new elites, which can be carriers of democratic and market values by diffusing\nthese values into elite behaviour and society at large. Scholars adopt one of two main\napproaches. First, the elite adaptation thesis claims that the reproduction of the\nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) elites into the new political and economic\narenas amounted to the \u2018privatization of the nomenklatura\u2019.1 The elite adaptation thesis\nsuggests that power at the national level is exercised by an \u2018interlocking directorate\u2019 of\nthe administrative and business elites who have largely been recirculated from the\nnomenklatura and reformulated as the so-called \u2018party of power\u2019.2 It is surmised that\n* Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science; and Birkbeck College,\nUniversity of London, respectively.

It is important to note that the use of the term \u2018nomenklatura\u2019\nto categorize the governing elites of the communist era is not without controversy, as Sovietologists in the 1960s\nand 1970s spent many years debating the parameters and meaning of this term. It is misleading to use the catch-all\n674 Notes and Comments\ninformal networks of power from the communist era adapted during the transition by\na process described by one commentator as \u2018the politicisation of industrialists, and of\nthe \u201cindustrialisation\u201d of politicians\u2019.3\nSecondly, there is an elite competition thesis. One of the most systematic studies of\nRussia\u2019s post-communist elites is by Lane and Ross who analyse the social\nconfigurations and value systems of the Gorbachev-era and Yeltsin-era national elites\nto demonstrate that the Russian transition has been marked by a fragmentation of elite\nvalues. A competitive struggle has ensued, they argue, between a \u2018political class\u2019 of\nsenior administrators and an ascendant \u2018acquisition class\u2019 of members of the\nintelligentsia with the relevant skills to take best advantage of the new conditions of\ntransition.4 While their analysis challenges the assumption made by Higley and Burton\nand transitologists that a \u2018consensually unified elite\u2019 is a precondition for a regime\ntransition, they confirm a conflict along an old\u2013new cleavage and around the issue\ndimensions of democratic governance and privatization.5 This monochromic entity of\n\u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 elites is replicated in a plethora of descriptive and quantitative analyses\nof national and sub-state elites, by Russian and non-Russian authors alike.6 Krysh-\ntanovskaya and White have used national elite socio-biographical data to propose that\nthis simple dichotomy between \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 is better understood as a functional\nbifurcation between \u2018old\u2019 political-administrative elites who are in competition with\n\u2018new\u2019 economic elites.7\nHow appropriate is the old\u2013new cleavage, conceptually and empirically, for\nunderstanding the role of elites in Russia\u2019s transition? The thesis should be verifiable\nboth at the national and sub-national elite levels to be a relevant measure of regime\ntransition. A large-scale time-series cross-regional analysis of sub-national elites\nemploying the socio-biographical profiles of regional assembly deputies (as representa-\ntive of the political elite) in 1990\u201394 challenged the old versus new bifurcation thesis\n(F\u2019note continued)\nterm \u2018nomenklatura\u2019 in determining elite reproduction in the post-communist transition precisely because the\ncategory does not sufficiently differentiate between former elites and lower-level functionaries appointed by the\nparty.\n3 I.

The old versus new\nelite distinction does not, therefore, appear to capture the complex nature of the\n\u2018interlocked\u2019 elite, as at the sub-national level it is overwhelmingly recruited from\nadministrative and economic managerial elites from the communist era that colonized\nthe democratically elected assemblies in order to preserve their grip on local power.8\nT R A N S I T I O N A N D L O C A L E L I T E A U T O N O M Y\nWhat can the study of elites predict for the prospects of post-communist transition in\nRussia? Our research re-evaluates the old\u2013new elite cleavage and explores the factors\nthat affect elite values through a systematic study of one Russian city. The sub-national\nfocus is informed by a desire to break from the fixation with the national level of many\nstudies, largely because the national picture is increasingly constituted by micro-level\nprocesses, particularly from the large urban centres. Our research seeks to correct the\nflawed Sovietological inheritance evident in many Western studies of Russian politics\nthat are often framed by a focus on \u2018high politics\u2019 and Kremlin personalities. This\napproach overlooks the most significant reality of post-Soviet Russian politics \u2013 the\nfragmentation of power following the disintegration of the CPSU and the resulting\ngreater spread of power resources in Russian politics. State-level regulation of elites and\ntheir recruitment patterns was previously one of the primary functions of the CPSU,\nperformed by the Central Committee apparatus in Moscow from the foundation of the\nregime. To counter \u2018localism\u2019 (mestnichestvo) the party periodically rotated its leading\npersonnel around the country. Rotation of elites ended with the collapse of the CPSU.\nThe weakness of the post-communist central state authorities in Russia, combined with\nthe weak development of integrative institutions, notably political parties, and the\nconsolidation of \u2018independents\u2019 in political representation, meant that local elites\nbecame highly static and more autonomous during the 1990s, particularly in their\nrecruitment. The dramatic rise in localism in Russian politics has compounded the\nineffectiveness and fragility of its federal system. Localism is largely a result not only\nof the immobility and autonomy of local elites, but also of the pressures of\ndemocratization as elites are compelled to respond to the demands of their local\nconstituencies. Elite self-interest and pressures from below largely explain why conflicts\nover budgets and other distributive issues permeate centre\u2013regional political struggle in\ncontemporary Russia. Certain Russian republics and regions have been fertile ground\nfor the mobilization of local elites around political economy issues of decentralization\nof political and economic power that have often been cloaked in a rhetoric of competing\nidentities. Regional mobilizations have been most evident in the Urals, Siberia and the\nFar East, where there are strong territorial identities grounded in the particularistic\n\u2018frontier\u2019 experience of settlement in a harsh environment, a political tradition of\nregionalism dating from the late nineteenth century, and a deeply ingrained historical\nresentment against corrupt Moscow-based elites who plunder the wealth of natural\nresources in these regions.9\n8 See James Hughes, \u2018Sub-national Elites and Political Transformation in Russia: A Reply to Krystanovskaya\nand White\u2019, Europe-Asia Studies, 48 (1997), 1017\u201336. This study compared the results of regional elections in\n1990 and 1994 in seven Russian regions.\n9 Distributive issues concerning natural resources also underpins local elite mobilizations in key republics such\nas Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, though in these cases ethnicity is a significant issue dimension.\n676 Notes and Comments\nIt is essential to examine elite behaviour in the urban context because it is here that\ninternational economic changes are felt most and the Westernization of values is likely\nto occur first. An ideal type of marketization assumes that Russian cities would develop\na governing and elite structure which resembles that of Western counterparts with their\nbalance between public bureaucratic politics and private economic power. Just as\nWestern elites are characterized by interlocking membership between these segments\nand recruitment from the highest social strata, so too the trend in post-communist Russia\nmay be to replicate this structural configuration.10 Likewise, one would expect Russian\nelites to exhibit a similar pattern to Western elites in sharing the same values across\nfunctional categories, with distinctions primarily by age cohort.11 We recognize that the\nexposure of Russian cities to the global economy, and the emergence of a private sector\nclosely involved with local administrative elites, makes for a strong likelihood that the\npressures of globalization, and the coalitions of public and private elites that emerge to\ndeal with these issues, will be important factors in understanding the behaviour of\npost-Soviet elites and their adaptation strategies over the longer term.\nE L I T E S I N N O V O S I B I R S K\nOur urban case study of local elites in transition investigates Novosibirsk, capital of\nNovosibirsk Region and the acknowledged territorial capital of Siberia. In analysing the\nstructure and attitudes of post-communist elites we selected Novosibirsk because of its\nstatus as one of the most important regional cities of Russia, for not only is it the\nadministrative, industrial, financial and cultural capital of Siberia, but also it is Russia\u2019s\n\u2018third\u2019 city (after Moscow and St Petersburg) in population size and political and\neconomic importance. As Novosibirsk is an overwhelmingly Russian populated city, its\nselection minimizes the significance of the ethnic factor, as the divisive implication of\nethnicity in some Russian cities would not neatly test the elite adaptation or competition\ntheses. Our city case is also at the centre of one of the areas of significant post-Soviet\nnon-ethnic regionalism. Siberia, Russia\u2019s immense resource periphery that stretches\nfrom the Urals to the Maritime provinces on the Pacific rim, has the most historically\ningrained tradition of autonomist regionalism of all Russia\u2019s regions, originating with\nthe oblastniki (regionalists) of the late nineteenth century.12 This regionalist tradition\nresonated during the post-Soviet transition as antipathy towards \u2018colonial exploitation\u2019\nfrom Moscow became part of the common currency of politics in Siberia\u2019s regions.\nA structural legacy of Soviet central planning left the city with a highly specialized\neconomic structure typical of the Soviet regional city. In the case of Novosibirsk the\nspecialization was in once prestigious but now bankrupt and severely downsized\nmilitary-industrial industries. The city is also a major communications hub\nlinking European Russia with the Pacific. Novosibirsk, consequently, suffered the\neconomic depression characteristic of the experience of most Russian regional cities.\nUnlike other regional cities, however, Novosibirsk has a major skills asset in\nAkademgorodok, one of the greatest concentrations of academic institutes outside of\n10 Evidence for this is suggested by Hughes, \u2018Sub-national Elites and Political Transformation in Russia\u2019.\n11 E. J. Eldersveld, L. Stromberg and W. Derksen, Local Elites in Western Democracies (Boulder, Colo.:\nWestview, 1995).\n12 For Siberian regionalism, see James Hughes, \u2018Regionalism in Russia: The Rise and Fall of Siberian\nAgreement\u2019, Europe-Asia Studies, 47 (1994), 1133\u201361; and \u2018Regionalisme economique en Siberie\u2019, in Marie\nMendras, ed., Russie: le gouvernment des provinces (Paris: FNRS\/CRES, 1997), pp. 105\u201328.\nNotes and Comments 677\nMoscow and St Petersburg. These typical and non-typical characteristics made a detailed\nprofile of the influential elites that govern Novosibirsk a useful means of generalizing\nconditionally about the trends in elites at the sub-state level during Russia\u2019s\npost-communist transition.\nD E F I N I N G T H E P O S T - S O V I E T E L I T E\nWe defined the elite as those persons exercising power and influence as a result of their\nfunctional or occupational status at the top of a range of socially significant hierarchies.\nWe selected the elite by a positional analysis of occupants of leading positions and\nby an appraisal of the networks within which they operate. In this way we aimed\nto uncover the layers of the elite stratum and then analyse it horizontally and vertically.\nA selection based purely on the formal institutions of power ignores the key individuals\nand networks that operate outside the formal decision-making process. Net-\nworks, commonly termed \u2018clans\u2019 in Russia, and usually interlocked with organized\ncrime, play a significant role in politics and business. These informal elites are virtually\nimmune to direct investigation and we did not attempt to do this, believing that such\nan approach would have been too disruptive of our study of elites. Instead we constructed\nour research in such a way that these informally influential persons would emerge\nindirectly.\nUsing positional analysis we identified four key segments of the elite: 1.\nAdministrative: senior administrative officials (governor and deputy governors, mayor\nand deputy mayors, raion administration heads, senior federal officials based locally);\n2. Elected: politicians and heads of political organizations (national and local); 3.\nEconomic: directors and senior managers of state and privatized enterprises, important\nentrepreneurs, directors of banks and financial institutions; 4. Cultural: leading cultural\nfigures and professional intelligentsia. We consolidated the positional membership of\nthe elite by a reputational analysis performed with the assistance of a panel of local\nexperts (academics and journalists) on a group of over a hundred elite members. Once\nthis core elite was identified, we selected others and added them to the list by ascertaining\nfrom the core members during interviews who else was important. This self-\nidentification of the elite was then verified by a continual triangulation of responses. The\nresearch is based on ninety-seven interviews (fifty-three of which were completed by\nBritish researchers and forty-four by local journalists acting as paid assistants) using a\nstandard questionnaire and conducted over two periods of time, April and August\u2013\nSeptember 1997. In cases when core members of the elite refused to be interviewed we\nreplaced them by someone else from the list. They were distributed into our functional\ncategories as follows: administrative elite 24.7 per cent, political elite 10.3 per cent,\neconomic elite 46.4 per cent and cultural-professional elite 18.6 per cent. We decided\nthe cut-off point for the sample on the basis of the rapidly diminishing importance of\nelite members.\nThe research measured the scale of elite continuity in Novosibirsk between the Soviet\nand post-Soviet periods. To demarcate \u2018new\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019 elites we took the 19 August 1991\ncoup as an historical marker for the end of the Soviet regime. We classified anyone in\nan elite position prior to this date as \u2018old\u2019 elite. We recognize that this demarcating point\nis problematic, but we consider other demarcating points such as the regional elections\nin 1990, the USSR elections in 1989, or even the Nineteenth Party Conference in 1988,\nas less viable since they did not result in any significant influx of new non-communist\n678 Notes and Comments\nelites, whereas significant changes in regime-type and personnel began with Yeltsin\u2019s\ncoming to power in August 1991.\nWe asked standardized questions on the respondents\u2019 age, education, career (both\nbefore and after 1991), nationality, political and associational activities to create the\nindependent variables. For the dependent variables, we posed questions to measure\nattitudes to political changes. In the interviews we asked all elites to comment on changes\nin economic-policy decision making in the city over the last year, and since 1991. From\nthese open-ended questions, we also noted the general comments elites made about their\nnetworks to understand how decision making operates and how it had changed during\nthe transition.\nWe developed five hypotheses to test the extent to which the structure and attitudes\nof the Novosibirsk elite follow a particular account of the post-communist transition.\nHypothesis 1: new elites are concentrated in the private sector and old elites occupy\nadministrative and political offices\nHypothesis 2: new elites are more positive towards change and privatisation than old\nelites\nHypothesis 3: age and education affect elite values: older people and the less educated\nare more conservative\nHypothesis 4: different types of elite are reputed to be powerful, thus confirming an open\nelite structure\nHypothesis 5: informal elites will be prominent, having high reputed influence,\ndemonstrating the power of non-public elites.\nB E Y O N D T H E O L D V E R S U S N E W E L I T E C L E A V A G E\nWe tested the hypotheses by running two way tables. Following Goodman we treated\nsnowball samples in the same manner as randomly drawn ones.13 Thus we tested for the\nsignificance of the associations with the chi-square statistic. Because of the small size\nof the some of the cells we also used Fisher\u2019s exact test, though the probabilities were\nnot a great deal different from the chi-squares. We then further tested the hypotheses\nwith a wider range of controls using ordered probit with attitudes to political change as\nthe dependent variables (see Appendix). The analysis compares and contrasts new and\nold elites according to education, prior CPSU status, elite segment, age, and prior and\ncurrent positions. Cross tabulation with the attitudinal variables reveals how the values\nof new and old elites differ on the processes of democratization, marketization and\neconomic performance in addition to the standard sociological variables. In this way,\nwe were able to determine the extent to which progressive innovator new elites act as\na driving force for regime transition and the importance of the inherited old elites,\nembued with outdated Soviet values.\nOld and New Elites: Continuity or Change?\nThe relative size of the segments of the elites provides some initial clues about the\ncharacter of post-communist government.

Their prominence is both a legacy of the\ncommunist system with its overlarge bureaucracy and a normal feature of urban\ngovernance as these elites tend to be prominent in any governing system. More\ninteresting is the size of the economic segment at 46.4 per cent, by far the largest group,\nwhich indicates the extent to which the new private sector elite has been incorporated\ninto the governing elite. These proportions need to be interpreted with some caution.\nTraditionally, economic managerial elites were a key element of the old Soviet elite.\nAlthough some of this new private elite are drawn from the newly privatized industries\nand are former bureaucrats, most of these new private sector actors are new entrants into\nthe elite. Table 1 shows current and prior employment types of the elite and reveals that,\nof the forty-five economic elite members, only 8.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent were\nrespectively politicians or bureaucrats in their previous employment, whereas 76.9 per\ncent had economic jobs in their previous role, a much higher stability in employment\ntype than the other sectors. More strikingly, only two members of the economic elite\nwere members of the administrative and political segment before 1991, while\ntwenty-eight of them are completely new elite members. By implication, just as the new\nelite is concentrated in the economic segment, the elite inherited from the pre-1991\nSoviet era saturates the senior administrative positions of power (see Table 2). This\nsuggests that old elite adaptation strategies have depended on their hegemony over\nadministrative power, which has remained largely undisturbed by democratization.\nAt first sight this would tend to support Hypothesis 1. If so, this would confirm the\nstandard assumption about post-Soviet elites in Russia that an inherited pre-1991\nT A B L E 2 Occupational Segment by New\/Old Elite\nNew elite Old elite Total\n(%) (%) (%)\nAdministrative 4.7 40.8 24.7\nPolitical 9.3 11.1 10.3\nEconomic 62.8 33.3 46.4\nCultural\/Prof 23.2 14.8 18.6\nTotal 100 100 100\n(n) (43) (54) (97)\nNote: \u00012\u000118.01 p \u0002 0.001; Fisher\u2019s exact test (two-sided)\u000119.63,\np\u00020.001.\n680 Notes and Comments\nT A B L E 3 Attitudes to Change by New\/Old Elite\nNew elite Old elite Total\n(%) (%) (%)\nPositive 60.4 44.4 51.5\nNeither for 16.3 25.9 21.6\nnor against\nNegative 23.3 27.8 25.8\nNo response 0.0 1.9 1.0\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0\n(n) (43) (54) (97)\nNotes: \u00012\u00013.2, p\u00010.361; Fisher\u2019s exact test (two-sided)\u0001 3.095,\np\u00010.303.\ncommunist-era elite remains entrenched in senior administrative positions as the \u2018party\nof power\u2019, and that elite turnover has been most marked in the economic sector of society\nwhich has been infused with a new dynamic innovator segment. This analysis appears\nto be reinforced when we analyse the attitudes of the elite to post-1991 changes \u2013\ndemocratization, decentralization and privatization. Those who held elite positions prior\nto 1991 tended to be much more negative towards change than the post-1991 new elite\n(see Table 3). This seems to be a weak confirmation of Hypothesis 2. However, the\nassociations do not reach the conventional significance levels, both for chi-square and\nexact tests, which suggests that the difference is not that strong. Even if the values of\nindifferent and negative are collapsed into one value and cross-tabulated with positive\nattitudes, the probability level only improves to 0.117 for \u00012 which is still outside the\n95 per cent confidence limit.\nWe found a similar set of relationships over attitudes to decentralization, where there\nis almost no difference between the new and old elites. The area where there is a major\ndifference is over attitudes to federal privatization, where the associations are strong and\nhighly significant (see Table 4). The new elite is much more positive towards\nprivatization whereas the old elite tends to be negative. Since old elites are generally\nrecognized as having indulged in rent-seeking during the privatization process, this\nresult is counter-intuitive. The explanation of why the elite differs in these attitudes may\nresult from the different composition of the old and new elites.

We test this idea more rigorously later.\nA much more complicated picture of elite change emerges, however, when we analyse\nthe relationship between attitudes to change and respondents\u2019 personal characteristics.\nWe found that level of education had no marked influence on attitudes. The place of\neducation (whether the elite was educated in Novisibirsk, Moscow or another region)\nwas also not important in explaining attitudes to change. Local socialization, however,\ndid have an impact on attitudes to decentralization, with local elites educated in\nNovosibirsk and Moscow being more sympathetic to greater local autonomy while those\neducated in other regions tended to oppose it. Neither was there a significant relationship\nwith respect to gender. In contrast, there are more marked differences in attitudes to\nchange between the generation cohorts as younger elites are much more positive and\nolder elites are much more negative irrespective of elite segment, with relationships that\nare significant at about the 0.05 level (see Table 5). It is important to note that old\/new\nelite is not synonymous with old\/young in terms of the generation cohorts, thus, a young\nperson in the elite prior to 1991 is classified as old elite.\nTo explore these relationships further we estimated competing ordered probit\nmodels.14 We included the hypothesized variables in different combinations to test the\nhypothesis whether the new\/old elite cleavage is the key factor distinguishing between\nelites (see Table 6). In Model 1, we found that the old\u2013new cleavage is not the key\nvariable explaining differences in elite attitudes to political change when controlling for\nage. The younger elite members are the more likely they are to favour change, and this\napplies to both inherited old elites and the supposed innovator new elites alike. If\nmembership of the old elite was not a factor, the relative position in the old elite was.\nIn Model 2, we found that position in the CPSU apparatus (any appointed position within\nthe party) prior to 1991 is one of the factors that has a significant effect on attitudes to\nchange when controlling for age.15 The political socialization of this part of the old elite,\nas implied by these posts, partially explains current political attitudes.\nT A B L E 5 Attitudes to Change by Age\n\u000239 yrs 40\u201349yrs \u000349yrs Total\n(%) (%) (%) (%)\nPositive 66.7 53.3 33.3 51.0\nNeither\/ 33.3 47.7 66.7 49.0\nnegative\nTotal 100.0 101.0 100.0 100.0\n(n) (24) (45) (27) (96)\nNotes: \u00012\u00015.82, p\u00010.054; Fisher\u2019s exact test (two-sided)\u00015.74, p\u00010.051.\nPercentages do not sum exactly to 100 due to rounding.\n14 See W.

The CPSU\napparatus covers a spectrum of elites, from a narrow functional pole at one end to an ideological pole at the other.\nIf defined narrowly to capture power elites, the apparatchiki would include only the most senior full-time\nfunctionaries of the Central Committee, and regional and local party committees. If defined more broadly\napparatchiki would refer to all those holding an appointed position of ideological and political significance within\nthe CPSU (this would include party secretaries at all levels).

In a similar way, in models not reported here, a\ndummy variable based on membership of the economic segment on its own appears to\npredict attitudes to privatization significant at the 0.05 level, but again age proves to be\nthe powerful variable and reduces the influence and efficiency of the economic segment\nterm. We do not include the economic segment in the final model because it does not\nreach the required level of significance. As a result we cannot explain attitudes to\nprivatization by reference to the economic interests of the different parts of the elites;\nthe sources of attitudes lie in the slowly changing generational transfer of attitudes. As\nin Table 6, in the final Model 3, we include membership of the apparatus. We found that\nvery similar variables predicted attitudes to municipal privatization, with the exception\nthat membership of the apparatus did not have so much influence here, and that\nmembership of local associations was important along with membership of national\nassociations. In fact, with a few variations, we can observe a similar small number of\nfactors that predict elite attitudes to the major changes, with the bulk of the expected\nrelationships being spurious, of the wrong sign or outside the required level of\nsignificance.\nSegmented or Power Elite? The Role of Local Administrative Hegemons\nAfter initial uncertainty in the immediate post-collapse period, the power of the old\nadministrative elite was underpinned by the institutional design of the Yeltsin\npresidential system. Yeltsin\u2019s pyramidal concentration of power in the vertically\norganized administrative hierarchy replicated the clientelistic systemic features of the\nSoviet era by reinforcing the power of patrimonial networks. The structure of the elite\nin Novosibirsk during the time-frame of our study indicates that there were parallel, but\ninterlocked, well-defined political and economic network systems. The authority of the\nformal institutions of political power (regional and city soviets) varies: the regional\nsoviet (and regional politics) was more powerful largely because local administrative\nand business elites colonized it and enhanced its reputed power. Elite networks were\ndominated by the senior administrative elite, however, which was only accountable to\nthe electorate through its two leaders: Governor Vitaly Mukha and Mayor Viktor\nTolokonsky. The governor and mayor perform the roles of two local hegemons presiding\nover their respective administrative branches, which in turn regulate local power.\nOne of the more obvious defining features of the local transition in Russia is the\nconflict between these two levels of power and their respective hegemonic leaders, and\nthe role of the centre in such struggles. At a deeper elite structural level, however, there\nis an apparent division of power between a specific element of the pre-1991 old elite,\nnamely the inherited administrative elite from the CPSU apparatus (apparatchiki) which\nis dispersed in both regional and city administrations, and the new post-1991 innovator\neconomic elite which is concentrated in the privatized business sector.\nThe self-preservation adaptation strategy of the apparatchiki was to abandon the party\nand colonize the post-1991 state institutions, and thereby continue to dominate, if not\nhold a near-monopoly, of administrative power at the regional and city sub-state levels.\nOf twenty-four administrative elite interviewees, the apparatchiki accounted for\nfourteen, and two others were inherited from the pre-1991 state bureaucracy. The\nargument that post-1991 elite change was marked by the inflow of the Soviet-era\neconomic managerial elite (khozyaistvenniki) into the post-communist administrative\nelite was not supported by our study, as only four members of the current administrative\nelite originated from this segment. The marginal scale of the turnover of administrative\n684 Notes and Comments\nelites in Russia\u2019s post-communist transition is demonstrated by the finding that only two\nmembers of the current elite held non-elite positions prior to 1991. Emblematic of the\ntrend in administrative elite recruitment are the careers of the two local hegemons.\nGovernor Mukha was the pre-1991 Novosibirsk Region party secretary, while Mayor\nTolokonsky was deputy chairman of the Planning Commission of the city party\ncommittee. This continuity was reinforced in the December 1999 gubernatorial election\nin Novosibirsk, when Mukha was defeated and replaced by Tolokonsky.\nThe impact of the infusion of innovators into the elite has been felt most dramatically\nin the economic sector. There is a common view that the privatized business elite in\npost-communist Russia is saturated with former Komsomol apparatchiki, who moved\nfrom administration to economic positions during the period of Gorbachev\u2019s\nperestroika.16 This view is not confirmed from our study. In Novosibirsk we interviewed\nforty-five current economic elite members, none of whom were recruited from the\npre-1991 Komsomol apparatus, and only two had formerly been part of the\nadministrative elite. There was some continuity as thirteen of the economic elite\ninterviewees had held similar elite positions prior to 1991. The majority (thirty out of\nforty-five) of our economic elite interviewees had assumed their positions post-1991,\nand most of these (twenty-seven out of thirty) had emerged from non-elite positions in\nthe pre-1991 period. We identify this group as the core of the innovator elite. A\nsignificant number of them (sixteen) were drawn from the cultural-professional\nintelligentsia. Local social capital is an important explanatory factor here, since\nNovosibirsk has a substantial resource of academic institutions in Akademgorodok,\ntogether with the third most important university outside of Moscow and St Petersburg,\nand economists trained at these institutions have a domestic and international reputation.\nSignificantly, a cluster of the innovator economic elite was recruited from the economics\nfaculty of the university and the Institute of Economics at Akademgorodok. This\nrelevant skills capacity may well be unusual, since most regional capitals\u2019 universities\ndo not match the concentration and prestige of Akademgorodok. This factor remains to\nbe tested in other regions.\nReputed Power: A Segmented or Unified Elite?\nBy asking elites to identify and rank the most important persons\/groups in the city, this\nstudy has revealed an open structure to the elites, at least as regards elite perception of\ninfluence in the city (see Table 8). As one would expect, given the levers of power at\nthe disposal of the administrative hegemons, almost without exception the governor, the\nmayor and their deputies were named as occupying the top three positions of influence\nin the city. At the same time, when respondents identified the fourth and fifth positions\nof influence they nominated a wide range of actors, such as key business leaders and\ninfluential pseudo-entrepreneurs from the criminal sector. Few actors outside these top\nfive could attract more than five other mentions as influential. Local power is what counts\nas regards perceived influence, as local politicians operating at the national level in the\nDuma were generally not seen as influential. The results show that the balance of power\namong elites is changing as innovator new elites have emerged and we can expect that\ngiven time they will challenge the hegemonic power of the inherited elites of the\nadministrative sector.\n16 Kryshtanovskaya and White, \u2018From Soviet Nomenklatura\u2019.\nNotes and Comments 685\nT A B L E 8 Persons Cited as being the Most Influential in the City\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th\n(%) (%) (%) (%) (%)\nMukha1 63.9 15.5 5.2 2.1 1.0\nTolokonsky2 25.8 51.5 8.2 3.1 1.0\nKiselev3 0.0 9.3 23.7 6.2 1.0\nGorodetksy4 0.0 8.2 1.0 0.0 2.1\nSychev5 0.0 0.0 5.2 9.3 3.1\nOthers 5.1 9.0 46.4 54.4 50.5\nNo response 5.2 6.2 10.3 24.9 42.3\nTotal 100.0 101.7 100.0 100.0 101.0\n(n) (97) (97) (97) (97) (97)\nNotes: Others had less than five respondents citing them as influential.

The significance of the age factor in\ndetermining elite attitudes suggests that the challenge of building a post-communist\nRussia is reflected in a generational conflict as much as it is a struggle between inherited\nand innovator elites. This is not unlike the kind of elite conflict between \u2018establishment\u2019\nand \u2018newcomer\u2019 and generational cohorts that one would encounter in any modernized\nurban setting. Two main trends in elite recruitment are evident from this study. First,\nelite continuity is concentrated in the administrative sector, where the administrative\nstructures of post-communist Russia have been colonized by elites from the CPSU\napparatus. Secondly, elite change is most apparent in the economic sector, where the\nmove to a market economy has seen the emergence of a completely new innovator elite,\nlargely recruited from the cultural-professional intelligentsia with relevant social\ncapital. While the institutional structures of the CPSU monist regime collapsed rapidly\nin 1990\u201391, the values and operational culture of this regime have persisted during the\ntransition and their residues are compressed in the administrative elite, which has been\nlargely inherited intact from the CPSU apparatus. The adaptation of this old elite\nsegment was eased by Yeltsin\u2019s concentration of state power in a vertically structured\nadministrative hierarchy that operated on a patrimonial principle. A younger, more\ndynamic and skilled innovator elite has emerged in the new world of privatized business,\nwhich is likely over time to increasingly challenge the existing elite structures and\nnetworks since it does not share their values on the transition. Post-communist transition\nhas, therefore, been processed largely within pre-existing power relationships.\nGenerational turnover within the elite will naturally over time erode reform resistance\nand allow new values to filter through into the system by gradual adaptation, or, in the\ncase of a major rejuvenation imposed from above, flood in. The dissonance of values\nbetween age cohorts identified in this study is one of the fundamental determinants of\nthe pace of change in Russia.\n686 Notes and Comments\nAPPENDIX: CODING OF THE VARIABLES\nCHANGE.

It also\ncontrols for some alternative explanations for environmental performance not included\nin the original article. The results suggest that the beneficial effects of neo-corporatism\nfor environmental performance are robust.

The positive results for environmental protection suggest that there may be\nbenefits of neo-corporatist institutions in areas beyond those with which they are\ntraditionally associated.\nEnvironmentalists often suggest that the main neo-corporatist groups (employers and\nunions) have vested interests in \u2018growth politics\u2019 and little concern for the environment.\nFrom this perspective, neo-corporatist groups are problematic because their interests\nfocus too much on economic issues, and the institutional system of corporatist bargaining\nis pathological because it privileges those economic interests over other, i.e.,\nenvironmental, interests, thus undermining environmental protection.\nThere are three main reasons to expect that the environmental critiques of\nneo-corporatism might be untrue. First, the encompassingness of traditional corporatist\ngroups suggests that they may more willing to consider the negative environmental\nexternalities of their decisions, since those externalities fall on their own constituents.\nIn this light, labour and employer associations have a strong organizational interest to\nresolve disputes in an efficient and effective manner, particularly within the broader\nconfines of environmental demands from popularly elected governments, who retain the\nthreat of state regulation.\nSecondly, the authority of peak associations helps to ensure two things that improve\nenvironmental performance. They have the authority and inclination to ensure that there\nis close monitoring and general compliance with environmental laws, lest some firms\ncheat to the detriment of others under their authority. In addition, those actors comprising\nthe associations have a greater ability and incentive to pursue common solutions to\nindustry pollution problems, thus diffusing \u2018best practices\u2019 more readily throughout the\neconomy.2\nThe third argument in favour of consensual corporatist institutions comes when one\nconsiders the performance of the alternatives. While neo-corporatist institutions may\nprovide less than ideal solutions to environmental problems, a competitive, pluralistic\nsystem of interest intermediation (which most environmental critiques of corporatism\ndo advocate) may be worse, exhibiting severe co-ordination and enforcement problems\nin society, even for groups of environmental advocates.\nThe original test validating the environmental benefits of corporatism involved a\ncross-sectional multivariate regression analysis. The dependent variable was a\ncomposite measure of changes in six pollution indicators \u2013 sulphur dioxide emissions,\nnitrogen oxide emissions, per capita municipal waste production, fertilizer use,\nrecycling rates and the percentage of the population connected to wastewater treatment\nfacilities \u2013 between 1970 and 1990. The independent variables in the original article\nincluded several measures of \u2018neo-corporatism\u2019 as well as a variety of alternative\nexplanations for environmental performance found in the literature. The results showed\na robust relationship between neo-corporatism and the environmental performance\nindicator. Here, I attempt to replicate the results using newly available data for a more\ncurrent period (1980\u201395) and European air pollution data from the European\nEnvironmental Agency. I use the same indicators of neo-corporatism though some of\nthe control variables (described below) are updated to reflect the different period.\nThere are at least three reasons why it is valuable to perform such a test. First,\nreplication serves to further the process of building theories. Secondly, since national\n2 David Soskice, \u2018Divergent Production Regimes: Coordinated and Uncoordinated Market Economies in the\n1980s and 1990s\u2019, in H.

Several reasons suggest that\nit would. First, the influence of the European Union (EU) on national environmental\npolicy is argued by many to have created upward policy convergence among its member\ncountries, many of which are included in the study.4 We might thus expect convergent\noutcomes in the more recent period. Secondly, some argue that the period since the end\nof the Cold War has lowered the political salience of environmental issues.5 If policies\nare linked to real outcomes, we would certainly expect more convergence in the 1980\u201395\nperiod. Thirdly, in countries like the United States, the more contemporary period is\nmarked by several innovations since the mid-1980s: the breakthrough on sulphur\ndioxide reduction policies under the Clean Air Act of 1990 (for example, using tradable\n3 Data for air pollution from the European Environmental Agency\u2019s CORNAIR database was obtained from its\nwebsite, www.eea.dk\/frdb.htm. Data are available from 1980. Other data are from OECD, Environmental Data\nCompendium (Paris: OECD, 1997). Differences between EEA and OECD data are not very significant.\n4 David Vogel, Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental Regulation in a Global Economy (Cambridge,\nMass.: Harvard University Press, 1995); Helen Wallace and William Wallace, Policy-Making in the European\nUnion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996). Additionally, public opinion data in EU countries suggests\nconvergence in opinion during the late 1980s. The mean percentage of respondents saying that environmental\nissues are very important became almost unanimously strong among all countries by 1990.\n5 Jahn, \u2018Explaining Performance and Policy Regimes\u2019, p. 107; but see fn. 4 above.\nNotes and Comments 689\npermits) is just one example. Finally, as individual countries approach practical limits\nto pollution reduction in particular areas, the two periods may differ due to the timing\nof particular countries\u2019 efforts. For instance, Sweden may have achieved its major\nprogress in the 1970s and early 1980s, while Ireland shows progress primarily after the\nearly 1980s. If so, we would expect Ireland to perform better relative to Sweden in\n1980\u201395 compared with 1970\u201390.\nThe updated environmental performance scores are reported in Table 1.6 Several\npoints should be noted. There are no data in the 1990s for air emissions in Japan, and\nrecycling figures are available only through 1992. Regression results reported below\nwere estimated with and without Japan in the sample, but this had no effect on the results\nof interest. Secondly, there are no glass recycling data provided for Norway before 1991,\nSweden before 1985 and Spain before 1983. For Spain this presents few problems. (Even\nif one assumed it had a recycling rate in 1980 that was half that in 1983, its overall\nperformance score changes little.) For Norway and Sweden, both neo-corporatist\nsystems, I used only the existing data. This almost certainly understates their overall\nenvironmental performance in the entire period, and thus biases the results against\nfinding a strong effect of neo-corporatism.\nThe 1980\u201395 performance score is closely, but far from perfectly, correlated with the\n1970\u201390 measure (r\u00010.85). The bivariate correlations between the environmental\nperformance scores and three measures of corporatism are also shown in Table 1. The\nfirst is the expert ranking of neo-corporatism, developed by Lijphart and Crepaz (LC\nCorporatism). The second is Gerhard Lehmbruch\u2019s classification of countries based on\ntheir degree of co-operative policy making between labour and employer organizations\nand the state (Concertation).7 The third (SME) is taken from David Soskice\u2019s\nclassification of the industry co-ordination, a concept closely linked to corporatism and\nwhat I suggest may benefit environmental performance. For all three measures the\ncorrelation with the updated environmental performance score is good: 0.71, 0.56, and\n0.86 respectively. (They are close to the coefficients reported in the earlier article.)\nRemoving Japan from the analysis does not alter the results. As a rough first cut, these\nresults suggest that the relationship between corporatism and environmental perform-\nance is not limited to the first twenty years of the environmental era.\nOf course, environmental policy performance is affected by a number of factors. The\noriginal article suggested a number of explanations: population density, per capita\nincome, economic growth, the strength of the environmental movement, economic\nstructural change, and cultural values (such as post-materialism). Here I add another\npotentially important factor \u2013 other macro-economic conditions. The priority of\nenvironmental issues, and hence the level of attention paid to them, is often considered\nto depend on economic conditions reflected in such things as inflation and unemploy-\nment. Survey evidence in Europe suggests that these two specific issues compete with\n6 All indicators are computed based on the 0\u2013100 scale. This contrasts slightly with the original article, but\nis a superior operationalization since it gives equal weight to the recycling measure in the aggregate index. The\nwater treatment variable from the original index was dropped due to missing data for the 1990s.\n7 Arend Lijphart and Markus Crepaz, \u2018Corporatism and Consensus Democracy in Eighteen Countries:\nConceptual and Empirical Linkages\u2019, British Journal of Political Science, 21 (1991), 235\u201356; Gerhard\nLehmbruch, \u2018Concertation and the Structure of Corporatist Networks\u2019, in John Goldthorpe, ed., Order and Conflict\nin Contemporary Capitalism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), pp. 60\u201380.

To control for such conditions\ngenerally, I use the misery index \u2013 the sum of unemployment and inflation.8 There are,\nof course, other possible explanations of environmental performance, but the political\nand background conditions listed here are major challengers to my main hypothesis.9\nTable 1 also shows the bi-variate correlation between the variables discussed above\nand the new environmental performance score. The relevant year or period used to\ncalculate independent variable values is indicated in the table and is consistent (given\nthe updated period) with the analysis in the original article.\nIn order to ensure that these correlations are not spurious, we need to control for\ncompeting explanations in a multivariate analysis. Table 2 presents regression estimates\nusing combinations of all of the control variables just discussed along with one of three\nmeasures of corporatism. Since the main purpose of this article is evaluating the\nempirical veracity corporatism hypothesis, I do not discuss the results for these control\nvariables here. The regression results in the first three columns use the six explanatory\nvariables for which there is data for all seventeen countries.\nFor each measure of corporatism, estimates are both substantively and statistically\nsignificant. Holding other factors constant, going from the most to the least corporatist\ncountry reduces environmental performance by about 140 to about 190 points. This is\nmore substantively significant than estimated effects for any other variable except levels\nof income. All three models pass tests for omitted variable bias and heteroscedasticity,\nand the errors are Gaussian normal. I evaluated a battery of diagnostic and sensitivity\ntests \u2013 such as dropping potentially \u2018influential\u2019 cases, robust (bi-weight) regression,\nextreme bounds analysis, and case-wise deletion. While the list of potential sensitivity\ntests is vast, all of the tests I performed suggest that the findings here for the variables\nof interest \u2013 the various measures of corporatism \u2013 are robust.10\nColumns 4\u20136 in Table 2 report results adding post-materialism and environmental\ngroup membership from the early 1980s. Since including these variables reduces the\nnumber of cases with full data by two (Switzerland and Austria) and adds two additional\nconstraints to the model, I dropped the misery index and service sector employment from\nthe model. The former showed no evidence of systematically affecting the performance;\nthe latter is closely correlated with income (r\u00010.80).11 As the results show, estimates\nfor the corporatist variables are a little smaller, but remain highly significant. Estimates\nfor post-materialism and environmental group strength are not significant statistically.12\nIn summary, the results reported here support the claim that corporatist institutions\nare closely associated with the effectiveness of national environmental performance.\nThe results are robust to different specifications of the dependent variable, including the\n8 Income and growth is from Robert Summers and Alan Heston, \u2018The Penn World Tables: Mark 5\u2019, Quarterly\nJournal of Economics, 106 (1991), 327\u201368.

This is undoubtedly due to the loss of 18 per cent of the\ndegrees of freedom (two cases). Other results (not shown) using various subsets of the control variables included\nin the first article yield coefficients and errors that are similar to these.\nNotes and Comments 691\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n2\nR\neg\nre\nss\nio\nn\nE\nst\nim\nat\nes\nfor\nP\nre\ndi\nct\nor\ns\no\nfE\nnv\nir\non\nm\nen\nta\nlP\ner\nfor\nma\nnc\ne\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\nism\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\nism\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nw\nith\nex\ntr\na\nfa\nct\nor\ns\nLC\nLC\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\nism\nCo\nnc\ner\nta\ntio\nn\nSM\nE\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\nism\nCo\nnc\ner\nta\ntio\nn\nSM\nE\nCo\nrp\nor\nat\nism\n63\n.1\n63\n.4\n14\n0.\n6\n59\n.2\n55\n.0\n13\n2.\n2\n(12\n.0)\n**\n(13\n.5)\n**\n(20\n.0)\n**\n(12\n.7)\n**\n(13\n.2)\n**\n(21\n.8)\n**\nPe\nrc\nap\nita\nin\nco\nm\ne\n0.\n02\n5\n0.\n03\n4\n0.\n01\n4\n0.\n01\n5\n0.\n00\n2\n0.\n00\n8\n(0.\n00\n8)*\n(0.\n01\n0)*\n*\n(0.\n00\n6)\n(0.\n00\n6)*\n(0.\n00\n6)*\n*\n(0.\n00\n5)\nG\nro\nw\nth\n\u0004\n49\n.2\n\u0004\n49\n.0\n\u0004\n49\n.6\n\u0004\n59\n.2\n\u0004\n55\n.3\n\u0004\n51\n.0\n(20\n.8)\n(22\n.7)\n(16\n.6)\n*\n(26\n.2)\n(28\n.3)\n(21\n.0)\n*\nM\nise\nry\nIn\nde\nx\n0.\n83\n0.\n85\n0.\n52\n(2.\n36\n)\n(2.\n60\n)\n(1.\n82\n)\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\nD\nen\nsit\ny\n0.\n29\n0.\n28\n0.\n16\n0.\n36\n0.\n36\n0.\n18\n(0.\n08\n4)*\n(0.\n09\n1)*\n(0.\n07\n1)*\n(0.\n09\n3)*\n*\n(0.\n10\n1)*\n*\n(0.\n08\n3)\nEm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt\n\u0004\n5.\n13\n\u0004\n6.\n34\n\u0004\n3.\n05\n(2.\n24\n)\n(2.\n48\n)*\n(1.\n79\n)\nPo\nst\n-m\nat\ner\nia\nlis\nm\n0.\n57\n0.\n74\n\u0004\n0.\n11\n(0.\n94\n)\n(1.\n01\n)\n(0.\n81\n)\nEn\nvi\nro\nn.\nm\nem\nbe\nrs\nhi\np\n\u0004\n11\n.8\n\u0004\n12\n.1\n\u0004\n1.\n8\n(5.\n0)*\n(5.\n5)\n(4.\n1)\nCo\nns\nta\nnt\n28\n0.\n7\n10\n1.\n2\n21\n5.\n0\n15\n4.\n2\n\u0004\n29\n.8\n12\n0.\n1\n(13\n4.3\n)\n(15\n9.6\n)\n(10\n8.7\n)\n(98\n.1)\n(10\n8.0\n)\n(79\n.3)\nO\nbs\ner\nva\ntio\nns\n17\n17\n17\n15\n15\n15\nR2\n0.\n89\n0.\n87\n0.\n93\n0.\n90\n0.\n88\n0.\n93\nA\ndju\nste\ndR\n2\n0.\n82\n0.\n79\n0.\n89\n0.\n82\n0.\n78\n0.\n88\nF\n13\n.4\n2\n11\n.0\n6\n21\n.9\n8\n11\n.4\n5\n9.\n46\n17\n.7\n9\nN\nor\nm\nal\nity\n3.\n53\n1.\n29\n0.\n98\n0.\n29\n4.\n11\n5.\n35\nCo\nok\nW\nei\nsb\ner\ng\n0.\n07\n0.\n09\n0.\n95\n0.\n36\n2.\n28\n0.\n72\nR\nes\net\n1.\n14\n1.\n02\n0.\n88\n1.\n33\n2.\n14\n0.\n91\nNo\nte\n:S\nta\nnd\nar\nd\ner\nro\nrs\nar\ne\nsh\now\nn\nin\npa\nre\nnt\nhe\nse\ns\nu\nn\nde\nre\nst\nim\nat\nes\n.\n*\nSi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nat\n5\npe\nrc\nen\ntl\nev\nel\n.*\n*\nSi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nat\n1\npe\nrc\nen\ntl\nev\nel\n.\n692 Notes and Comments\nuse of pollution data from more recent years, the inclusion of different and varied control\nvariables, the exclusion of individual cases, differences in how corporatism is\noperatonalized and a battery of other regression diagnostics. As suggested earlier, the\npositive relationship between corporatist institutions and environmental performance is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that such arrangements encourage public policy with a\ngreater eye to aggregate interests.\nIn conclusion let me respond to two potential challenges to these results and those\nin the previous paper.13 The first is that the measures of corporatism used are outdated,\nand that corporatism itself is in decline. First, if the second charge is true, the institutional\nchanges will affect environmental outcomes with some lag; thus, we may not see the\nresults of \u2018de-corporatization\u2019 until years after my dataset ends. Secondly, several recent\nstudies dispute the degree of de facto de-corporatization.14 Indeed, many suggest that\ncorporatism is quite important for success in the \u2018new wave\u2019 of environmental policy\nmaking, which seeks to promote structural economic changes in the direction of \u2018green\nproduction\u2019. In line with this claim, it is important to stress most observed \u2018declines\u2019\nin the number of corporatist institutions (outside, perhaps, of wage bargaining) within\ncountries over time are small relative to the cross-national differences, and that the\nmeaning of such changes is debatable.\nA second criticism is that the results reported here are inconsistent with several recent\ncomparative case studies.15 Three points are appropriate here. One is that there are also\ncase studies stressing the importance of corporatism in environmental policy,\nparticularly in new areas.16 Secondly, many policy case studies focus more on policy\ncreation and less on performance and implementation. Nor do such studies tend to assess\nlong-term performance. (Of course, policy and performance are hard to separate, and\nevaluating where corporatist institutions should and should not matter will require\nfurther research and debate.) Thirdly, just as there are limitations on the ability to test\nspecific mechanisms when looking at aggregate data (as I do here), there are limits to\nthe inferences that can be made on the basis of several case studies in specific\npolicy-making areas in a few countries. At the very least, the discrepancy between the\ntwo levels of analysis may be a fruitful way of generating specific tests.17\n13 A third challenge \u2013 about the type of statistical analysis in this, and the previous, study \u2013 is available in an\nappendix to this Note, available at this Journal\u2019s website.\n14 On corporatist \u2018resilience\u2019 in general, see Siaroff, \u2018Corporatism in 24 Industrial Democracies\u2019.

Do encompassing interest groups exert some influence in obtaining\nadequate compliance or interest among their members? Are there \u2018collective goods\u2019 that corporatist interests\nprovide to their members (i.e., regulated exchange of information or technology) to facilitate efficient compliance?\nIs industry in corporatist systems more willing to share real information with governments in the interest of getting\nmore efficient regulation or standards? Our current research is trying to address these questions.\nNotes and Comments 692a\nM E T H O D O L O G I C A L A P P E N D I X\nI discuss three methodological issues which have been raised about this and my previous\narticle. Some of these criticisms are common (mis)conceptions about statistical analysis.\nAs in other aspects of social science methodology, there is always a grain of truth or\n\u2018technically yes, but \u2026\u2019 when using statistics. Almost all of these comments are relevant\nin research using statistics on \u2018small-n\u2019 datasets, which is not uncommon in comparative\npolitics. Despite the inherent limitations of statistical analysis with such datasets, many\nof the problems with small-n statistical analysis stems from misunderstandings about\nhow to use such data, rather than the inherent limits of the data itself.\nDegrees of Freedom and Omitted Variables\nBecause the main purpose of my article(s) lay in testing particular hypotheses rather than\nexhaustively accounting for all variation in national environmental performance, I have\nbeen interested in showing that the results I obtain are significant (statistically and\nsubstantively) under a variety of conditions. Because of this, some of the models\nreported may be considered \u2018overspecified\u2019, i.e., they contain many \u2018insignificant\u2019\nindependent variables and consequently few degrees of freedom. One reason for taking\nthis approach is that it shows that, even if one controls for a number of credible predictors\nof performance, the coefficient for corporatism (i.e., the independent variable of interest)\nis precisely estimated. If anything, finding \u2018significant results\u2019 despite also including\nextraneous variables in the model improves the credibility of the results.\nIn an earlier draft of this Note, I included a model with twelve cases and eight\nexplanatory variables (i.e., only three degrees of freedom!) where corporatism was\nsignificant. Other, more reasonable (i.e., with more degrees of freedom), model\nestimates mirrored the results of that \u2018ridiculous\u2019 model. Some colleagues suggested\nthat, because there were so few degrees of freedom in the overspecified model, all of\nthe results in the model were meaningless. Yet the fact that the estimates for the\ncorporatism variables remained statistically significant despite the severely limited\ndegrees of freedom available suggests that that particular result is robust.\nAnother reason for \u2018overspecifying\u2019 models is to avoid an \u2018omitted variable bias\u2019. If\na regression model excludes an independent variable that is in truth correlated with the\ndependent variable and is correlated with the independent variable of interest (such as\ncorporatism), the estimate of the variable of interest will be biased.18 This is a potentially\nserious problem, since a biased estimate may change the sign of the estimated effect,\nand hence the substantive interpretation of the independent variable. Though there is no\nbias if the independent variables in question are not correlated, this seldom occurs in\npractice. Omitted variable bias is thus a major potential problem. Erring on the side of\navoiding a biased estimate, even at the expense of inflating the error associated with that\nestimate, often justifies examining \u2018overspecified\u2019 models in small-n analysis, even if\nthe results never make it into publication.\nUnfortunately, such attempts are (apparently) seldom undertaken. Much more typical\nis the case that someone develops a hypothesis (perhaps from a supporting case study\nor two), creates an index and finds a correlation, perhaps with a control or two added\n18 Eric Hanushek and John Jackson, Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences (New York: Wiley, 1977),\npp. 79\u201386.\n692b Notes and Comments\nin separate models for good measure (though the controls are seldom competing political\nhypotheses, but structural features, like income or demography). More appropriate is a\nmethod that identifies competing political explanations and, in essence, controls for all\n(or as many as possible) simultaneously.\nOf course, an \u2018overspecified\u2019 model cannot be used to proclaim that the particular\nmodel as a whole explains a lot of the variation in a particular dependent variable (say,\nby looking at an R2 statistic). With enough variables in the model (even if none of their\neffects are really different from zero), the R2 will be high. But if the results are used to\nexamine the validity of particular parameter estimates, it can enhance our confidence\nin that particular estimate. Where one draws the line is not easy. In most respects the\ntwo approaches (parsimony or avoiding a possible omitted variable problem) trade off.\nFor instance, a significant coefficient in a model with fifteen cases and ten independent\nvariables may become insignificant if we drop one of the other variables in the model.\nSensitivity Tests and Outliers\nRegression results typically are interpreted as being, in some sense typical effects.\nTechnically, however, they are based on mathematical averages, and everyday and\nmathematical uses of \u2018average\u2019 are not the same. If nineteen people have an income of\n$20, and 1 of $500, the \u2018average\u2019 person has $44; the same is true if ten people have\n$40 and ten people have $48 in income. The first example demonstrates how a single\n\u2018influential\u2019 case can distort statistical analysis particularly when the number of cases\nis small.19 Thus, it is generally useful to provide some type of \u2018sensitivity analysis\u2019 to\nestimated coefficients. This is the second critical methodological issue related to this\nNote and to small-n analysis more generally.\nTwo recent cross-national statistical analyses have made extensive use of a number\nof sensitivity tests available to researchers.20 As these studies note, the simplest and most\npopular methods are (1) ensuring the residuals obey the typical Ordinary Least Squares\n(OLS) assumptions (constant variance); (2) alterations in the specification of the model\n(for example, what happens to the estimates of interest when other variables in the model\nare excluded?); (3) sequential exclusion of individual \u2018extreme\u2019 cases to ensure that\nparticular estimates are not wholly responsible for the overall estimated effect. The\nauthors also use other approaches that are variations of non-parametric weighted-re-\ngression techniques, weighting observations based on the size of their errors or their\n\u2018influence\u2019 on the simple regression estimates. (Dropping cases is equivalent to\nassigning them a weight of zero.)\nThough these techniques are advanced, it is interesting that they cast no further light\non either the authors\u2019 results (or the results in my papers). Neither Bernhard\u2019s nor\nGranato et al.\u2019s paper provides us with insight as to the relative importance of any of\nthese tests. Is failure on one of the tests dispositive of the simple regression results? If\n19 A classic debate in comparative political economy over just this issue in small-n analysis is between Peter\nLange and Geoff Garrett and Robert Jackman in the mid-1980s. See Peter Lange and Geoff Garrett, \u2018The Politics\nof Growth in Industrial Democracies, 1974\u20131980\u2019, Journal of Politics, 47 (1987), 244\u201356. A review and update\nof the literature, employing some of the tests mentioned in the text, is Lyle Scruggs, \u2018The Politics of Growth\nRevisited\u2019, Journal of Politics (forthcoming).\n20 James Granato, Ronald Inglehart and David Leblang, \u2018The Effect of Cultural Values on Economic\nDevelopment\u2019, American Journal of Political Science, 40 (1996), 607\u201331; William Bernhard, \u2018A Political\nExplanation of Variations in Central Bank Independence\u2019, American Political Science Review, 92 (1998), 311\u201328.\nGranato et al. notes that they are the most widely used sensitivity tests (pp. 620, 622, fn. 12).\nNotes and Comments 692c\nnot, which tests should we rely on? Granato et al. suggest that the popular method of\ndropping cases is the method they \u2018like the least\u2019, because there is no theoretical reason\nto drop cases and the information therein. Yet the same applies to the use of the\nnon-parametric weighting techniques. Why should we assign weights between zero and\none based on residuals from a model that was presumably correctly specified in the first\nplace?\nWhile it is essential to use various sensitivity tests in small-n analysis, like deciding\nwhere to draw the line between parsimony and omitted variable bias, there is often a\ntrade-off in small-n analysis between a correctly specified theoretical model with\ncoefficients that are less robust in the face of \u2018high tech\u2019 tests and one that is\nparsimonious yet more robust in such tests. Indeed, this is precisely a reason why altering\nthe set of control variables in a model is a test of estimator robustness. These questions\nshould not be taken to suggest that sensitivity tests are useless. In terms of the current\nNote and its predecessor, the results for the corporatism estimates, which are the primary\nfocus of both papers, do not appear to be based on highly influential cases, and are robust\nacross all of these various tests. In short, how the batteries of sensitivity tests should be\nused to evaluate the robustness of results and how these results are interpreted depends\non the particular questions being asked.\nCollinearity among Regressors and Hypothesis Testing in Small-n Analysis\nA third methodological issue from my papers concerns correlation between independent\nvariables or multicollinearity in statistical analysis. Many statistical analyses using small\ndatasets to test competing theories are bound to face this problem. When two variables\nare correlated it is hard to confidently estimate the effect of each variable independently\n(since they technically are not). The impact of multi-collinearity is to inflate standard\nerrors (i.e., increase the confidence interval around an estimated effect), but it does not\nbias the estimates themselves.21 The practical implication is that high correlation\nbetween the measures of a variable of interest (such as corporatism) and other\nexplanatory variables in the model (such as the Misery Index) will, if anything, make\nus less likely to reject the null hypothesis (no effect) on the main variable. For example,\nthe fact that the corporatism estimates in the paper remain statistically significant here\n(and in the first paper) suggests that, despite the inclusion of collinear regressors, the\ncorporatism estimates are still statistically different from zero at typical confidence\nintervals (such as 95 per cent).22\n21 Hanushek and Jackson, Statistical Methods, pp. 86\u201390.\n22 There are a number of methods for diagnosing collinearity problems. All are poor at differentiating severe\nand slight collinearity problems. For instance, in the data used in this Note, service sector size and income are\ncorrelated at 0.80. Most researchers \u2013 including two methodologists I consulted on the issue \u2013 consider that a clear\ncollinearity problem. However, standard diagnostic statistics (variance inflation factors) are contradictory. The\nmain point from the Note and discussion, however, is that the argument is moot, since the corporatism estimate\nof interest is significant with any permutation of the regressors.\n"}
