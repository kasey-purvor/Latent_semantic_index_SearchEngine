As a result\ntheir use as electron sources for field emission based flat\npanel displays has been greatly explored, with the emergence\nof prototype displays.4 While extensive two terminal field\nemission measurements have been performed,2\u20136 consider-\nably fewer three terminal studies7\u201310 have been undertaken\nand those that have been performed have often been from\narrays of nanotubes. In this letter we demonstrate a method\nof examining the gated field emission properties of an indi-\nvidual CNT and a method for establishing the gate transpar-\nency factor and the shielding of the emitter due to the pres-\nence of the gate itself. By performing the measurements in a\nscanning electron microscope \u0001SEM\u0002 with electrodes at-\ntached to manipulators, we are able to investigate individual\nemitters, with a degree of freedom to move the electrodes in\nreal time. Our approach opens the possibility of an effective\nmethod for testing the performance of a range of emitter\nstructures prior to fabricating a prototype device, where the\ncharacteristics of an ensemble of emitters are measured. In\naddition, an ability to test single emitters may lead the way\nto enhance the emission uniformity from CNTs and increase\nthe fraction of nanotubes that are actively emitting.\nMultiwalled carbon nanotubes were synthesized by a\nplasma arc discharge system between two graphite elec-\ntrodes. The subsequent carbon deposit was purified by mi-\ncrofiltering and oxidization at 500\u00b0C to remove any amor-\nphous carbon and carbon particulates, leaving purified CNTs.\nThe CNTs were mixed into a polymer solution of polysty-\nrene, which was dissolved in toluene. An ultrasonic treat-\nment was used to improve the dispersion of the CNTs within\nthe polymer. Vacuum casting methods were then used and\nthe as-cast films were hot pressed to remove any residual\nsolvent. To expose a single CNT the sample was mechani-\ncally broken and the broken edge studied in a Cambridge\nInstruments Stereoscan 250 III scanning electron micro-\nscope. A single CNT with a height of 1.5 \u0001m and a radius of\napproximately 40 nm was found. This emitter was chosen as\na\u0002Electronic mail: r.c.smith@eim.surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/89\u00026\u0001\/063111\/3\/$23.00 89, 06311\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toit was perpendicular in orientation to the substrate. The sur-\nrounding area around the emitter was carefully scanned ap-\nproximately 100 \u0001m in all directions to ensure that there\nwere no CNTs present in all directions from the chosen emit-\nter. This is an important step as neighboring CNTs could\naffect the emission results by field screening,6 and that the\npresence of any other CNTs beneath the gate electrode would\ncomplicate our results.\nTwo piezoelectric micromanipulators were mounted in-\nside the SEM chamber to control the position of both the\nanode and gate electrodes with an accuracy of 40 nm in all\ndirections.11 The anode electrode used was a sharpened tung-\nsten tip with end radius of 5 \u0001m. Further details of the ex-\nperimental setup are described elsewhere.11 The gate elec-\ntrode used was manufactured in a FEI Nova 600 dual beam\nfocused ion beam \u0001FIB\u0002 system to create a freestanding metal\nstructure with a 1 \u0001m hole. A tungsten tip with end radius of\n5 \u0001m was physically bent at the tip and its sidewalls etched\nby 30 keV Ga ions to create a 1.5 \u0001m thin metal film. The\nelectrode was then rotated through 90\u00b0 and a 1 \u0001m hole\netched through by a similar process. The resulting structure\ncan be seen in the inset to Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, where the view is down\nthe inside of the probe so that the 1 \u0001m hole can be clearly\nobserved. The gate and anode electrodes were mounted on\nthe micromanipulators within the SEM and positioned 1 and\n40 \u0001m above the CNT tip, respectively, as shown in Fig.\n1\u0001a\u0002. It is important to note that the large \u000130 \u0001m\u0002 structure\nto the center left of Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 was examined for any CNTs\n\u0001not shown here\u0002, which could possibly interfere with emis-\nsion testing. However, no CNTs were observed in this area\nand we conclude that this feature does not affect our emis-\nsion results. Figure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows a higher magnification SEM\nimage of the gate electrode above the CNT. The gate to CNT\nseparation used was 1 \u0001m and the threshold voltage is de-\nfined for 10 nA of emission current.\nField emission characterization was performed on the\nsetup of Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 using two computer controlled Keithley\n238 high current source meters connected to the substrate\nand gate, and a Keithley 237 high voltage source meter con-\nnected to the anode. The SEM beam current was turned\ndown during testing as to not interfere with emission. Ini-\ntially, the substrate and gate were held at 0 V and the anode\nvoltage ramped from 0 to 500 V, in 25 V steps.

Lett. 89, 063111 \u00022006\u0001limit of 1 \u0001A was employed to reduce the risk of sample\ndamage. The variation of the anode current with anode volt-\nage can be seen in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. At 0 V gate bias \u0001VG\u0002, an emis-\nsion current of 10 nA is reached at an anode voltage, VA, of\n340 V and for a 1 \u0001A emission current, an anode voltage of\n460 V is required. The gate bias was then increased from\n5 to 25 V in 5 V steps, with measurements of the anode cur-\nrent as a function of anode voltage made at each gate volt-\nage. It is apparent from Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 that the maximum current is\nreached at steadily decreasing anode voltages from\n460 to 180 V as the gate voltage is increased. The emission\ncharacteristics of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 were subjected to a Fowler-\nNordheim analysis with resultant plots shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nAssuming a work function of 5 eV, enhancement factors of\n620, 1749, 1773, 1696, 2049, and 1920 are found for gate\nvoltages of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 V, respectively. The\napparent enhancement factor of 620 calculated at 0 V gate\nbias assumes that the whole of the anode field \u0001voltage\u0002 is\ndropped across the vacuum gap and neglects the effects of\nfield screening due to the presence of the metal gate sus-\npended above it. For this reason I-V measurements were per-\nformed with the gate electrode removed, as shown in Fig.\n2\u0001a\u0002 \u0001data marked with a star\u0002. For a current of 10 nA, a\nvoltage of 230 V is required, rising to 313 V for the maxi-\nmum current of 1 \u0001A. It is also important to note that the\nremoval of the gate electrode does not increase the threshold\nfield. If the results seen so far were due to emission from the\ngate electrode, rather than the CNT, then one might expect a\nlarge increase in threshold field by removing the gate. As this\nis clearly not seen here, we are confident that the electron\nsource is the CNT, not the gate. Performing a Fowler-\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Scanning electron microscope image of the experimental setup.\nAnode electrode is seen at the top of the image, 40 \u0001m from the CNT. The\ngate electrode is positioned 1 \u0001m above the CNT tip.

Redistribution subject tofactor of 794. This value of enhancement factor is intrinsic to\nthe nanotube under investigation \u0001depending on the length\nand radius\u0002. Armed with a knowledge of the applied voltage,\nVa, and the enhancement factor, it is possible to calculate the\nlocal threshold field, EL=\u0002Va \/D, where D is the interelec-\ntrode spacing \u000140 \u0001m\u0002. For the case of two terminal mea-\nsurements, the local field for a 10 nA current is 4.57 V\/nm.\nThis is the field that will be required to extract the same\ncurrent for the unbiased three terminal structure. In such a\nsituation, it is possible to introduce a screening factor due to\nthe gate electrode \u00011\u2212\u0003\u0002, such that,\nEa\u0002\u00011 \u2212 \u0003\u0002 = EL, \u00011\u0002\nwhere Ea is the value of Va \/D in the three terminal arrange-\nment. Using the above values and Eq. \u00011\u0002 allows a value of\nthe screening factor, \u0003, of 0.32 to be calculated for the\npresent configuration. In order to examine whether the value\nof the screening term is affected by the magnitude of the\ncurrent, a similar analysis was performed at 1 \u0001A current. In\nthe absence of the gated electrode a voltage of 313 V is\nrequired, rising to 460 V, in the presence of the metal elec-\ntrode. Using the same value of the \u0002 as before \u0001794\u0002 and with\nthe aid of Eq. \u00011\u0002 gives an identical gate screening factor of\n0.32. If this screening of the field was ignored, a naive cal-\nculation of the local field, assuming an applied voltage of\n460 V and an enhancement factor of 620, would overesti-\nmate the local field at 5.27 V\/nm, which is an overestima-\ntion by 15% of the actual local field. This shows that asiz-\nable fraction of the applied electric field is screened by the\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 Anode current against anode voltage for gate biases of 0 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 5\n\u0001\u0002\u0002, 10 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 15 \u0001\u0003tm\u0002, 20 \u0001\u0004\u0002, and 25 V \u0001\u0005\u0002.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 063111 \u00022006\u0001The decrease in the anode voltage required for 10 nA of\ncurrent as the gate bias increases \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004 can be explained\nby the local field experienced by the nanotube now having a\ncontribution from the gate electrode. In such a situation,\nelectrons being emitted by the nanotube are initially attracted\nby the gate electrode and are then accelerated towards the\nanode. This gives rise to the possibility that a fraction of\nelectrons will not reach the anode but will contribute to the\ngate current. Figure 3\u0001a\u0002 shows the variation gate current \u0001IG\u0002\nagainst gate voltage for three values of anode voltage \u00010,\n500, and 1000 V\u0002. It is apparent for the two lowest anode\nvoltages investigated that the gate current never exceeds 2\n\u000410\u221211 A, even for gate voltages of 100 V. Only for an\nanode voltage of 1000 V is there evidence for an increase of\ngate current with gate voltage, due to the onset of emission.\nSuch low values of gate current, in contrast to other studies\nfor arrays of emitters,10 reflect the intrinsic level of emission,\nand the in situ manipulation is a way to characterize this\nintrinsic emission. Figure 3\u0001b\u0002 shows the variation of the\nratio of anode to gate currents as a function of anode voltage\nfor each gate voltage. At low anode voltages the ratio lies\nbetween 0.1 and 100 reflecting the low noise determined\nlevel of current present at such low anode voltages, where\nthe onset of emission has not occurred. For anode voltage in\nexcess of 100 V, the ratio steadily increases for all the gate\nvoltages explored, reaching 106 for VA=250 V.\nPrevious reports on three terminal device structures\ncomprising nanotube,7 nanostructured carbon,8 and\nnanofibers9 \u0001CNFs\u0002 as the electron sources also analyzed\n7\nFIG. 3. \u0001a\u0002 Variation of gate current against gate voltage for three different\nanode voltages: \u0001\u0001\u0002 0, \u0001\u0003\u0002 500, and \u0001\u0004\u0002 1000 V. \u0001b\u0002 Ratio of anode current\nto gate current plotted against anode voltage for gate biases of 0 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 5 \u0001\u0002\u0002,\n10 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 15 \u0001\u0003\u0002, 20 \u0001\u0004\u0002, and 25 V \u0001\u0005\u0002.

Redistribution subject toindividually in a gate well emit 40 nA to the gate electrode at\na gate bias of 40 V, which corresponds to a gate transpar-\nency, defined as the ratio of emission current collected at the\nanode to emission current collected at the gate, of 99%.\nWork on nanostructured carbon8 as electron sources utilized\na transmission electron microscopy grid as the gate elec-\ntrode, placed 55 \u0001m from the cathode which resulted in high\ngate turn on voltages of 220 V; however, a gate transparency\nof only 50% is calculated at maximum emission of 10 \u0001A.\nGuillorn et al.9 reported the use of carbon nanofibers as elec-\ntron sources with a relatively high gate voltage of 85 V re-\nquired for an emission from the CNF of 0.3 \u0001A; however,\nthis corresponds to a high gate transparency of 99%. The\nresults presented in this letter have the following character-\nistics when considering Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001a\u0002: At a gate voltage\nof 25 V the peak anode current of 1 \u0001A \u0001at VA=180 V\u0002 is\nobserved \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. From Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 the corresponding gate\ncurrent is \u000510\u221211 A. This corresponds to a transparency of\n99.99%, which is a more efficient gate structure than seen in\nprevious work.7\u20139 It can also be seen from Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 that\nwhen the structure was examined at higher values of VG and\nVA \u0001100 and 1000 V, respectively\u0002, an emission to the gate\nelectrode of 5\u000410\u221210 A is seen. When considering that the\nmaximum emission current was limited to 1 \u0001A, this corre-\nsponds to a still high gate transparency of 99.95%.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated in situ character-\nization of three terminal field emission from a single CNT.\nWe have shown that the presence of the gate electrode can\nscreen the applied anode field by about 32% and that care\nmust be taken in performing Fowler-Nordheim analysis on\nthe I-V characteristic of such gated structures. Our method of\nmanipulation of electrodes can be used to examine the three\nterminal field emission properties of a range of tip based\nemitters, provided the tip-to-tip lateral separation is suffi-\nciently large. The ability to manipulate the position of anode\nand gate electrodes permits measurement and analysis of in-\ndividual emitters and offers opportunities above those cur-\nrently available for large area testing of arrays of emitters.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership for funding this research.\n1S.
