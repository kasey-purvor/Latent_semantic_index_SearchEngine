Rheumatoid synovitis is characterised\nby complex leukocyte and cytokine networks. The per-\nsistence of inflammation is mediated, in part, by the\nstromal micro-environment, but the underlying causes\nremain unclear [1,2]. Over the last decade there has\nbeen particular interest in antibodies to citrullinated\npeptides and proteins as important aetiological and pre-\ndictive factors in early RA [3-5]. Citrullination of pro-\nteins is a post-translational modification, which can\noccur as a normal part of cell apoptosis [6]. However,\nthis process may induce antibody formation in suscepti-\nble individuals [7], which may predate clinical arthritis\nby several years [8]. Subsequent environmental triggers\nmay enable anti-citrullinated protein\/peptide antibodies\nto enter joints and contribute to a chronic inflammatory\nresponse [9].\nAnti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies\nare highly specific for RA, but are not detectable in all\npatients [10]. This raises the possibility that distinct\nmechanisms exist for the pathogenesis of synovitis in\nanti-CCP positive and negative patients. Indeed, anti-\nCCP positive patients show both environmental and\ngenetic associations not present in anti-CCP negative\nRA. For example, tobacco smoking is a well-recognised\nrisk factor for anti-CCP positive RA especially amongst\nHLA-DRB1 individuals expressing the \u2018shared epitope\u2019\n[11]. Furthermore anti-CCP positive patients have more\nsevere radiological destruction and poorer outcomes\n[12], and synovial pathology appears to differ according\nto anti-CCP status in the established phase of RA [13].\n* Correspondence: k.raza@bham.ac.uk\n1MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, School of Immunity and Infection, The\nUniversity of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nCader et al.

Moreover, there is\nevidence that pathogenic mechanisms in the first few\nmonths may differ from those in longer duration disease\nand that this phase may be more responsive to therapy\n[14,15]. Hence we aimed to establish whether the clini-\ncal phenotypes of anti-CCP positive and negative disease\nwere distinct at the earliest clinically apparent phase of\nRA, within 3 months of symptom onset.\nMethods\nPatients were recruited from the rapid access early\ninflammatory arthritis clinic at Sandwell and West Bir-\nmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. Patients referred to the\nclinic by their General Practitioners were seen within\n2 weeks. Participants were included in the current study\nif they presented within 3 months of the onset of any\nsymptom attributed by the assessing Rheumatologist to\ninflammatory joint disease (pain, stiffness, swelling), had\nclinically apparent synovial swelling at baseline and ful-\nfilled 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria\n(ACR) for RA, either at baseline or during 18 months\nfollow-up [16].\nData were collected on patient demographic variables,\nfulfillment of the ACR criteria, duration of symptoms\nand whether the mode of onset was acute or insidious.\nTender (n = 68) and swollen (n = 66) joint counts were\nperformed. CRP, ESR, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP2\nstatus were measured at baseline. Radiographs were per-\nformed of the hands and feet. Systematic clinical follow-\nup was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.\nThe anti-CCP positive and negative groups were com-\npared, with differences in means assessed using a two-\ntailed unpaired student t-test. Proportions were\ncompared using a chi-squared test. Data analysis was\nperformed using the Statistical Package for Social\nSciences, version 17.0 (SPSS Institute, Chicago, IL,\nUSA). P values < 0.05 were considered significant.\nPatients gave their informed consent prior to inclusion\ninto the programme. The study received ethical approval\nfrom the local research ethics committee.\nResults\nAt the time of this analysis 265 patients with an initial\nsymptom duration of less than 3 months and with com-\npleted follow-up had been recruited to the early synovi-\ntis cohort; of these, 92 patients (34.7%) fulfilled 1987\nACR criteria for RA at some point during follow-up and\nwere included in the present study. Of these 92 patients,\n48 patients had anti-CCP antibodies and 44 patients had\nno anti-CCP antibodies at inclusion. There were an\nadditional 35 patients (13.2%) with persistent unclassi-\nfied arthritis at the end of 18 month follow-up, all of\nwhom were anti-CCP negative. 21 of these patients were\ntreated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs\n(DMARDs); if such agents had not been used, it is pos-\nsible that they may have eventually reached a diagnosis\nof RA.\nThe patient groups were comparable in terms of gen-\nder, age, ethnicity and smoking status (Table 1). In addi-\ntion, patients had similar durations of symptoms and\nmodes of onset. There were no significant differences in\nthe presence or duration of morning stiffness. Moreover,\nthe other 1987 ACR criteria for RA were equally likely\nto be present in the anti-CCP positive and negative\ngroups. This includes the presence of nodules and radi-\nological evidence of erosions, both of which were very\nrare at presentation. The exception, however, was that\nanti-CCP positive patients were significantly more likely\nto be seropositive for rheumatoid factor (83.3% vs.\n11.4%, p < 0.001). The mean number of ACR criteria\npresent at baseline was greater for anti-CCP positive\n(3.73) than for anti-CCP negative patients (3.23) (p =\n0.03). However, this was not significant after repeating\nthe analysis with rheumatoid factor status excluded.\nThere was also a significant difference in the proportion\nof patients meeting at least 4 criteria needed for a diag-\nnosis of RA at baseline (anti-CCP positive, 58.3%; anti-\nCCP negative, 36.4%; p = 0.04). However, there was no\ndifference in the mean time from symptom onset to the\nfulfillment of classification criteria for RA (anti-CCP\npositive, 158 days; anti-CCP negative, 131 days) in those\nwho did not fulfill classification criteria at baseline (Fig-\nure 1). It should be noted that the 1987 ACR criteria\nstipulate that articular symptoms and signs should have\nbeen present for at least 6 weeks; this criterion was\nincluded in the present analysis. 28 patients who even-\ntually fulfilled 1987 ACR criteria for RA (15 anti-CCP\npositive, 13 anti-CCP negative) were seen in clinic\nwithin 6 weeks of the onset of symptoms and hence, by\ndefinition, were unable to fulfill 1987 ACR critera for\nRA at baseline. Of these, 15 patients (8 anti-CCP posi-\ntive, 7 anti-CCP negative) would have met sufficient cri-\nteria needed for diagnosis at baseline, had the 6 week\ncriterion been disregarded.\nThere were no significant differences in the total ten-\nder or swollen joint counts, number of affected joint\nareas or 28-joint score (as used in the DAS28 scoring\nfor RA, data not shown). In addition, inflammatory mar-\nkers were comparable in both groups. Amongst different\njoint regions, a significantly different prevalence of swel-\nling was only seen in the knee joint, with a higher\nCader et al.

This is perhaps surprising\ngiven the emerging consensus that anti-CCP positive\nand negative states represent distinct clinical entities.\nThere is mounting evidence suggesting not only sepa-\nrate molecular mechanisms underlying these two patient\ngroups, but also different genetic and environmental\npredispositions as well as a different clinical progression.\nHowever, consistent with a previous study of patients\npresenting within 2 years of onset, our data provide evi-\ndence that, despite these pathological differences, there\nis a shared clinical phenotype for RA presentation\nregardless of anti-CCP status. Not only do patients with\nanti-CCP positive and negative disease present with\nsimilar distributions of joint disease, but they also have\ncomparable ages of onset and levels of inflammation.\nHowever, anti-CCP positive patients do fulfill\nTable 1 Characteristics of patients with and without anti-CCP antibodie\nanti-CCP positive (n = 48) anti-CCP negative (n = 44) P value\nFemale (n (%)) 28 (58.3%) 22 (50.0%) 0.42*\nAge at inclusion, years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 56.6 \u00b1 15.0 61.5 \u00b1 14.7 0.12**\nEthnicity - Caucasian (n (%)) 38 (79.2%) 39 (88.6%) 0.22*\nSmoking status - Current\/ever smoked (n (%)) 31 (64.6%) 28 (63.6%) 0.92*\nSymptom duration, days (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 49.3 \u00b1 20.2 56.4 \u00b1 22.3 0.12**\nMode of onset (n (%))\nAcute 25 (52.1%) 25 (56.8%) 0.65*\nInsidious 21 (43.8%) 18 (40.9%)\nUnspecified 2 (4.16%) 1 (2.27%)\nMorning Stiffness\nDuration, mins (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 93.3 \u00b1 89.5 123.8 \u00b1 92.8 0.11**\nNo. patients \u226560 mins (n (%)) 28 (58.3%) 32 (72.7%) 0.15*\nSymmetry (n (%)) 35 (72.9%) 33 (75.0%) 0.82*\nHand joint involvement (n (%)) 43 (89.6%) 41 (93.2%) 0.54*\n\u2265 3 joint areas involved (n (%)) 31 (64.6%) 30 (68.2%) 0.63*\nNodules (n (%)) 2 (4.17%) 1 (2.27%) 0.61*\nErosions (n (%)) 1 (2.08%) 2 (4.54%) 0.51*\nRheumatoid factor positive (n (%)) 40 (83.3%) 5 (11.4%) < 0.001*\n1987 ACR criteria for RA\nTotal No. (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 3.73 \u00b1 1.09 3.23 \u00b1 1.14 0.03**\nNo. fulfilling \u2265 4 criteria (n (%)) 28 (58.3%) 16 (36.4%) 0.04*\nTender joint count (max 68) (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 8.33 \u00b1 7.80 9.66 \u00b1 8.90 0.45**\nSwollen joint count (max 66) (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 5.79 \u00b1 4.51 7.07 \u00b1 5.83 0.25**\nESR mm\/hr (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 32.3 \u00b1 20.1 38.7 \u00b1 29.3 0.23**\nCRP mg\/L (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 29.0 \u00b1 27.0 31.4 \u00b1 30.8 0.70**\nStatistical test applied: *Chi-squared test, **Unpaired student t-test\nFigure 1 Cumulative proportion of patients fulfilling 1987 ACR\nclassification criteria for RA over 18 month follow-up period.\nSolid line = anti-CCP antibody positive patients.

This is predominantly due to the fact\nthat anti-CCP positive patients more often express rheu-\nmatoid factor, a well described phenomenon [17]. Con-\nsequently, anti-CCP positive patients were more likely\nto have met at least 4 criteria, thereby fulfilling classifi-\ncation criteria for RA at initial presentation. However\nthere were no significant differences in the proportions\nof patients meeting each of the other six 1987 ACR cri-\nteria when then anti-CCP positive and negative patients\nwere compared.\nThis study has a number of limitations. Firstly, data\nare available to suggest that seropositivity for anti-CCP\nand rheumatoid factor are associated with delayed pre-\nsentation in patients with RA [18,19]. These surprising\nobservations raise the possibility that a subpopulation of\nseropositive individuals were not seen early enough for\ninclusion in our patient cohort. This may have intro-\nduced selection bias. Secondly, the study may have been\nunderpowered to detect more subtle clinical differences\nbetween patient groups. A retrospective power analysis\nwas carried out for each of the variables tested. This\nshowed that the study had an 80% power to detect a dif-\nference in proportions between anti-CCP positive and\nnegative groups of between 0.27 and 0.30 (27 to 30%)\ndepending upon the particular joint area under\nconsideration.\nInterestingly, this study showed an increased likeli-\nhood of knee involvement at presentation in anti-CCP\npositive patients. This finding is consistent with other\nresults of previous studies which have shown that anti-\nCCP positivity is associated with increased progression\nof radiological destruction and that initial knee involve-\nment is also a positive predictor of greater radiological\ndamage [20]. Our data suggest that the previously\nreported adverse outcomes of patients presenting with\nknee involvement may be due to the increased probabil-\nity of anti-CCP seropositivity in such patients.\nConclusions\nIn summary, anti-CCP positive and negative patients\nhave similar baseline clinical presentations. This does\nnot necessarily conflict with current opinion that antibo-\ndies to citrullinated peptides play an essential role in the\npathogenesis of RA. The role of anti-CCP status in pre-\ndicting progression of undifferentiated early arthritis\ninto RA is well established [21,22], as is the association\nwith increased bone destruction. It is possible that the\nshared clinical phenotype reported here may conceal dif-\nferences that are occurring at a pathological level. This\nhighlights the need to further investigate histological\nchanges in early RA, which may demonstrate differences\nin anti-CCP positive and negative patients and have\nimportant therapeutic implications.\nAuthor details\n1MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, School of Immunity and Infection, The\nUniversity of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. 2Department of\nRheumatology, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust,\nBirmingham B18 7QH, UK.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nAll authors were involved in study design and in drafting and revision of the\nmanuscript.
