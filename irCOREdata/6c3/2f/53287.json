These data were formerly\navailable online from the World Data Centre (WDC) for Ge-\nomagnetism at the Danish Meteorological Institute till the\nstart of 2007 and then at the authors\u2019 institute. The post-\nprocessing was the application of a 2-point running mean and\nCorrespondence to: S. Macmillan\n(smac@bgs.ac.uk)\ntransformation to declination, horizontal and vertical intensi-\nties (DHZ) from the original northerly, easterly and vertical\nintensities (XYZ) recorded in the tables of the observatory\nyearbooks. The reason for the post-processing was presum-\nably to make these earlier hourly values compatible with the\nlater values which were hourly mean DHZ values centred\non the half hour (Eskdalemuir yearbooks, 1932 onwards).\nThere is no record of when this post-processing was done.\nThe 1911\u20131917 data were XYZ spot values on the hour (ac-\ncording to yearbook table headings but more on this later)\nand the 1918\u20131931 data were XYZ mean values centred on\nthe hour (Eskdalemuir yearbooks, 1911\u20131931). This post-\nprocessing had the effect of lowering the spectral content for\nhigh frequency studies performed on the hourly value time\nseries. However the significance of this only really came to\nlight with the development of the Inter-Hour Variability in-\ndex in the 2000s.\n2 The discovery\nThe first indication of something unexpected in the early\nEskdalemuir hourly values was from correspondence with\nLeif Svalgaard in 2004 where he presented ratios of the\nnewly defined Inter-Hour Variability indices for the UK ob-\nservatories. The IHV index is the sum of absolute differ-\nences of hourly means (or values) for a geomagnetic com-\nponent from one hour to the next over the six hour interval\naround local midnight. The ratios for the annual means of\nthe IHV indices for the horizontal component as recorded at\nthe UK observatories at Eskdalemuir, Lerwick, Abinger and\nHartland revealed a sharp change in the Eskdalemuir record\nat the end of 1931 (Fig. 1).\nThe creation of the IHV index was motivated by issues\nconcerning the aa index (Svalgaard et al., 2003). The aa\nindex has been critical for inferring long-term changes in\nthe Sun (e.g. Lockwood et al., 1999) as it is the longest\nrunning index of magnetic activity available, dating back\nto 1868. However some records of observatory hourly val-\nues are also very long and this lead to the development and\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n284 S. Macmillan and E. Clarke: Resolving issues concerning Eskdalemuir geomagnetic hourly values\nFig. 1. Ratios of annual means of UK observatory IHV indices\nbased on data available at the Edinburgh WDC before 9 August\n2010. Green is ratio of Eskdalemuir to Abinger, red is ratio of Es-\nkdalemuir to Hartland and blue is ratio of Eskdalemuir to Lerwick.\nanalyses of IHV indices for inferring long-term changes in\nthe Sun and near-Earth space (Svalgaard et al., 2004; Mur-\nsula et al., 2004; Mursula and Martini, 2006; Svalgaard and\nCliver, 2007a, b). The problem with the Eskdalemuir IHV\nseries was known at this stage and attempts were made to\ncorrect it (Martini and Mursula, 2006). Another point to note\nat this stage was that the World Centres were acknowledged\ncollectively for the supply of the hourly values and the indi-\nvidual WDC supplying the data was not identified. This turns\nout to be important. In the meantime the long-term solution\nto the problem seemed to lie with either undoing the post-\nprocessing or redigitising the original hourly value tables in\nthe observatory yearbooks.\n3 Undoing the post-processing\nIn theory, it should be possible to undo such relatively simple\npost-processing by obtaining an initial value from the year-\nbooks and applying it to each series of post-processed data\nusing\nEi+1 = 2E\u2032i\u2212Ei\nwhere Ei is an original hourly value of an element of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field for hour i and E\u2032i is a 2-point averaged\nhourly value of an element of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for\nhour i. Knowledge of E0 (the value at the start of the time\nseries) should be all that is required to regenerate the original\nseries of data. However it turns out that the transforming\nfrom XYZ to DHZ and the limitations of the WDC format\nsignificantly complicates matters. We explain this now in\nmore detail.\nThe digital storage and exchange format that is widely\nused for hourly values is the WDC format, described at\nhttp:\/\/www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk\/catalog\/master.html. This is the\nnatural extension of the way that hourly values were pre-\nsented in the older yearbooks. The use of a baseline value,\none line of data per element per day and 1 nT resolution is\ncommon to both the yearbook tables and the WDC-format\nfiles. The unit for declination of the magnetic field in the\nWDC-format file is tenth arc-minute, and the resolution is 1\ntenth arc-minute.\nThere are 4 options of how the post-processing was done:\n1. The XYZ values were transformed to DHZ, then 2-point\naveraged and rounded to 1 nT.\n2. The XYZ values were transformed to DHZ, rounded to\nnearest 1 tenth arc-minute and 1 nT (the resolution of\nthe WDC format), then 2-point averaged and rounded\nto 1 nT. This option is possible if WDC-format files of\nunaveraged DHZ existed at an intermediate stage.\n3. The XYZ values were 2-point averaged, then trans-\nformed to DHZ and rounded to nearest 1 tenth arc-\nminute and 1 nT.\n4. The XYZ values were 2-point averaged, rounded to\nnearest 1 nT, then transformed to DHZ and rounded\n(again) to nearest 1 tenth arc-minute and 1 nT. This op-\ntion is possible if WDC-format files of averaged XYZ\nexisted at an intermediate stage.\nWithin each of these options are choices for rounding 0.5 to\nthe resolution of the WDC-format files which is 1. Whilst the\ndefault rounding in the IEEE 754-2008 floating point arith-\nmetic standard is to round to even, its implementation is de-\npendent on computer platform and programming language.\nRounding to zero and rounding up are other possibilities.\nAlso unknown is whether the same rounding was applied to\neach component. A further complication is that the Y com-\nponent in the yearbooks assumes west is positive, but it is not\nknown whether this was the case in any intermediate WDC-\nformat files.\nBecause of these uncertainties in the post-processing, and\nalso because any resulting values from attempts to undo the\npost-processing would require comparison with the original\ndata sources, the yearbook tables were scanned and digitised.\nIt should be noted that the original data are the analogue\nmagnetograms and tables of absolute observations and whilst\nthere is a programme underway in BGS to digitise these for\nlong-term preservation, it was not deemed practical to use\nthese to obtain new series of absolute hourly values within a\nreasonable timescale.\n4 Experiences with scanning and digitising yearbook\ntables\nIn support of a study by Martini and Mursula (2006), work\nbegan to redigitise the original hourly values directly from\nthe monthly tables in the Eskdalemuir observatory year-\nbooks. Originally this involved making scanned copies of\nonly the January tables for each year as described in Martini\nAnn. Geophys., 29, 283\u2013288, 2011 www.ann-geophys.net\/29\/283\/2011\/\nS. Macmillan and E. Clarke: Resolving issues concerning Eskdalemuir geomagnetic hourly values 285\nFig. 2. Example of a TIFF file of a monthly table of hourly values scanned from the ESK yearbooks. This illustrates the typical poor quality\nof the original tables.\nand Mursula (2006), however this work continued to com-\nplete the full set of digital images for all months.\nThe yearbooks were located and transported to Edinburgh\n\u2013 some from the BGS archive at Hartland observatory and\nothers from Eskdalemuir. Following tests on and selec-\ntion of scanning hardware and Optical Character Recognition\n(OCR) software, the monthly tables for each component for\n23 years (1932 and 1933 were also done, resulting in a total\nof over 800 tables) were scanned and saved as tagged im-\nage file format (TIFF) files. Some of the yearbooks were in\ndegraded condition and thus the clarity of the tabulated data\nwithin the images obtained was often poor (Fig. 2). Using\nOCR software, attempts were made to extract the data from\nthe TIFF files. However too many errors or unrecognised\ncharacters were obtained for each image and the process was\nabandoned as one that was uneconomical in time and effort.\nThe OCR method was confirmed as too much of a challenge\nin this case, when example files were sent to three differ-\nent specialist companies. They all recommended direct data\nentry rather than OCR. One company was commissioned to\ncarry out the data entry work.\nThe digitised XYZ data were returned in Microsoft Excel\nspreadsheet format, with each table on a single worksheet as\nper its original layout in the yearbook. The tables included\nthe daily averages as well as the averages over each UT hour\nin the month. These averages would prove useful for quality\ncontrol (QC) purposes. The data were transformed into DHZ\nand two-point averaging applied. This enabled comparison\nwith the existing post-processed WDC data. It was clear at\nthis stage that there were many errors in the digitised data\n(e.g. Fig. 3 top and middle panels) and that the data entry\ncompany had not carried out the QC that had been assured.\nFurther work was then required to identify and correct the\ndata entry errors. Firstly the Excel spreadsheets could be\nused to compute daily and monthly UT averages, and com-\npared against the corresponding values entered in the spread-\nsheets. Any errors identified at this stage were corrected.\nSecondly these revised data were then compared again with\nthe post-processed WDC data, as in the previous paragraph,\nand all differences greater than 10 nT identified and cor-\nrected: a task that proved to be very labour intensive. Al-\nthough a large number of smaller errors remained (e.g. Fig. 3\nbottom panel) it was clear that the Eskdalemuir hourly val-\nues from this procedure were a better match to the original\ndata in the yearbooks than the post-processed data available\nfrom the WDC. These data were not released however as it\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/29\/283\/2011\/ Ann. Geophys., 29, 283\u2013288, 2011\n286 S. Macmillan and E.

This task has now been superseded by\nthe discoveries and work carried out in the remainder of this\npaper.\n5 Comparison of WDC holdings\nUntil recently it had been widely assumed that the WDC-\nformat files for Eskdalemuir held at different WDCs con-\ntained the same data. However it was noted in Love et\nal. (2010) that the files held at Edinburgh and Kyoto WDCs\nwere different and that the Kyoto files appeared to contain\nunaveraged XYZ values. A detailed comparison of the files\nwas made by the authors, including monthly plots of differ-\nences, using the 4 options of post-processing listed in Sect. 3.\nIt was found that option 1 with rounding up for 0.5, re-\nsulted in the least differences between the 2 data series, par-\nticularly for Z. Table 1 lists the annual means and standard\ndeviations of the differences in DHZ for this option. Al-\nthough Table 1 shows that the overall differences are not al-\nFig. 4.

For this the monthly plots of differ-\nences, yearbook scans and digitised values were used. For\n1917 it was the July values in Y and Z in the Kyoto files that\nwere wrong. For 1925 it was the January values in Y in the\nKyoto files that were wrong and the December values in Y\nand Z in the Edinburgh files that contained additional errors\nover and above the post-processing.\nFurther checking of the Kyoto files revealed missing\nchunks of data in 1915 and 1921. Again the yearbook scans\nand digitised values were used to complete the files. A final\nquality-control measure was to select one day at random for\neach year from 1911 to 1931 and to check that the values in\nthe WDC-format files agreed with those from the yearbooks.\nThe corrected Kyoto files were transmitted back to Kyoto\nand the post-processed Edinburgh files available online were\nreplaced with the correct files on 9 August 2010.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/29\/283\/2011\/ Ann. Geophys., 29, 283\u2013288, 2011\n288 S. Macmillan and E. Clarke: Resolving issues concerning Eskdalemuir geomagnetic hourly values\n6 Revised IHV indices\nAs further evidence of the reliability of the updated files, we\ncompute IHV indices for a number of observatories and com-\npare ratios of their annual means. In Fig. 4 it can be seen that\nthe revised Eskdalemuir IHV index series no longer shows\na large step at end of 1931 when compared with that from\nNiemegk. In order to investigate the anomalous value for\n1911 we \u201czoom in\u201d and use ratios of monthly means of IHV\nindices. In Fig. 5 we can see there is a step at the end of 1911.\nThis is when the hourly values at Eskdalemuir changed from\nbeing spot values to mean values (as noted by Martini and\nMursula, 2006, the headings of the yearbook tables of hourly\nvalues are not clear in this respect, but a note in the text of\nthe yearbook for 1912 spotted by Love et al., 2010, states that\nthe values are mean values centred on the hour). Changing\nfrom spot to mean values also happens in other observatory\nseries (in Niemegk it happened before the start of the Es-\nkdalemuir series) and whilst an adjustment to the resulting\nIHV series can be estimated for each observatory (Svalgaard\nand Cliver, 2007a), the ultimate remedy may lie in making\nhigh-quality scans of the original magnetograms and year-\nbooks and producing hourly mean values where previously\nonly hourly spot values are available. A programme to do this\nis currently underway for the UK observatories. In the mean-\ntime extra information has been added to the metadata for\nEskdalemuir held at http:\/\/www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk\/. This states\nthat 1911 hourly values are spot values centred on the hour\nand that 1912\u20131931 are mean values centred on the hour.\n7 Conclusions\nThe significance of this work is that Eskdalemuir data are\nwidely used in studies concerning long-term trends in mag-\nnetic field variability and inferred solar variability (for ex-\nample Mursula et al., 2004; Svalgaard and Cliver, 2007b).\nFor that reason inconsistencies and errors in the Eskdalemuir\ntime series need to be identified and carefully corrected. For-\ntunately, because Eskdalemuir is but one of several observa-\ntories used in these studies, the conclusions on solar variabil-\nity are unlikely to need reconsidering. However it was the\ndetailed analyses undertaken in these solar variability studies\nthat brought the problem reported here to light. For this we\nare grateful and we believe that future research using long\nseries of hourly mean values can now be made with high\nconfidence following the extensive analysis described here.\nWork is underway to improve the metadata, including time-\ndependent metadata, held for each observatory at the World\nData Centres.\nAcknowledgements.
