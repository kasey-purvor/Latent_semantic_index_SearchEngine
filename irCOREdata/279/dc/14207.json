Whilst we agree with the concerns of the authors on the problems of\ncommodification and the increasing control of learning technology from a financial or\npredominantly management perspective, we wish to offer a reinterpretation of the\nresearch by taking a stricter analysis of the events described by the authors.\nModels of best practice\nAs we understand, the research follows the design and evaluation of a training course on\nrunning e-courses. The design of the course took into account various 'models' that either\nas embodied in software or as discussed in the literature can be considered to represent\ncurrent knowledge or best practice in order to provide academic legitimacy to the design.\nThe principal models would seem to be: an MLE\/VLE technical framework (aligned to a\ncorporate world), the learning paradigm of communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) and\nthe e-moderating five-stage model (from Salmon, 2000). Anecdotal evidence from the\nevaluation suggests that the participants found the course constraining. This suggested\nthat these 'models' may be useful but are dangerous if such 'reifications' stultify develop-\nment in 'communities of practice'.\nThese set models cover a number of epistemological frameworks. The corporate world is\nframed within the politics and economics of delivery in higher education, the five-stage\nmodel within action research (Salmon, 2000: 24-5) and 'communities of practice' within\nsituated learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991). The evaluation of the course remains\nanecdotal. Our view is that a single framework removes many inconsistencies and offers a\n6!\nChris Tompsett and Graham Alsop On reification: a reinterpretation of designed and emergent practice\nmore positive future for the community of learning technologists. The framework that we\nchoose is 'situated learning'. From this point onwards it is critical that all terminology is\napplied within this framework.\nA single framework\nThe concept of 'community of practice' (Wenger, 1998: 6-7, 47-52, 72-84) is the starting\npoint in Wenger's understanding of society, with meaning (revealed through participative\npractice, ibid.: 51-65); learning and identity are derivative concepts. Reification (ibid.: 55,\n57-62) refers to the collection of processes or devices through which we communicate\nmeaning with others in the community: 'we project ourselves onto the world and, not\nhaving to recognize ourselves in those projections, we attribute to those meanings an\nindependent existence' (ibid.: 58). Organizations and education are only considered in the\nlast two chapters.\nA strict interpretation for 'community of practice' and 'reification' are central to our\nanalysis. Several communities are easily identified from the article written by Lisewski and\nJoyce: the managers of the institution, the providers of the software, the researchers as\nlearning technologists, the researchers running the course, the participants on the course\nand other academics. However, a community is not automatically 'a community of\npractice'. A 'community of practice' requires mutual engagement, shared repertoire and\ncommon enterprise (ibid.: 73). Within this definition there is sufficient evidence that these\ncommunities represent distinct 'communities of practice' (though individuals may belong\nto more than one such community). Let us presume, for the sake of argument, that the\ncommunity of learning technologists can be considered as one 'community of practice'\nand address the concept of reification.\nWhen a 'community of practice' reifies some aspect of a practice, for example a software\nor a design model, then it is not possible to separate the reified model (as published) from\nthe way in which it is used in practice - since 'at the level of meaning, the process and the\nproduct are not distinct' (ibid.: 60). The meaning of a five-stage model, for example, is\nrepresented by its actual use in the community. The authors' research is one part of that\nmeaning. Reification only occurs when the use of a model becomes an equal part of\npractice, 'participation and reification cannot be considered in isolation; they come as a\npair' (ibid.: 62). From Wenger's perspective, the five stages have not yet been reified in the\ncommunity of practice of learning technologists.\nSuch an argument can also be applied to the VLE\/MLE system used. In this case a further\ndistinction can be made. The VLE\/MLE represents a model that would have different\nmeanings, through practice, in each community of practice. In Wenger's model the\ntechnical system is common and acts as a boundary object (ibid.: 106-8). The meaning for\neach community of practice will be different and can act as a point of conflict or\ncoordination (ibid.: 107). Even if the VLE\/MLE model is commodified within the\ncommunity of management, it is not the same as a 'reification' in that community, let alone\nthe same reification in other communities of practice.\nFor Wenger the design of learning is complicated since learning derives from practice\n(ibid.: 214) and, by implication, negotiation. In most educational institutions mutuality\nand learning through practice are difficult to achieve (ibid.: 264-5). The aim is that the\n62\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\ndesign of education does not prevent learning through practice (ibid.: 229, 267). In this\ncase, the learners may have been provided with experience of these models, but the models\nhave become more critical than the practice of e-moderation. To present a fixed structure,\nwhether the structure should support negotiated meaning or not, is to force a separation\nbetween the planned (teaching) and the emergent (learning) (ibid.: 266-7). For Wenger,\nparticipation in learning must include both mutuality and negotiation.\nA reinterpretation\nIn concluding, we would not, from Wenger's perspective, consider the models as described\nby the authors as stultifying. The models used cannot be separated from their use in\npractice and there is little evidence that practice is wide enough to establish reifications of\nhow they should be used. It is only through practice that such objects could ever become\nreified (and only then stultified). The community of education technology practitioners,\nreifies them itself and not the institution to which it belongs:\nOne can attempt to institutionalize a community of practice, but the community of\npractice itself will slip through the cracks and remain distinct from its institutional-\nization. (ibid.: 229)\nIt would be possible to provide more detailed analysis of other issues but this would\nrequire more time and space. One final comment is perhaps required as to the choice of\nWenger's model as a framework for interpretation of the original article. We selected\nWenger's approach as it allows us to describe the wide range of issues that were originally\ndescribed, although activity theory (Nardi, 2001) or action research (McNiff, 1992) would\nalso be possible and both could produce different views. What remains critical is the\napplication of a single framework from the design of the activity through to evaluation and\nanalysis.\nFinally, we return to the assumption above that the community of learning technologists is\na 'community of practice'. The repertoire, points of mutual engagement and shared\nenterprise appear confused if we allow any particular technology to determine the\nrepertoire. No consistent practice is likely to evolve. If we exclude particular technology,\nbut include within the repertoire the methods for understanding learning and the impact of\ntechnology on the learning process we may continue to make progress.\nReferences\nLave, J. and Wenger, E.
