This study argues that this interpretation is misleading. Judicial\nstatistics collected from the mid-nineteenth century suggest that poaching was\nmuch more widespread in the North and Midlands than has previously been\nacknowledged. These industrialising regions largely determined the national trends\nin poaching in the second half of the century which have usually been considered to\nbe characteristics of rural society in the South.TheSouth shared neither the national\npeak in prosecutions of the mid-1870s nor the dramatic decline in prosecutions\nthereafter. It considers a range of possible explanations for these different regional\ntrends. These include a discussion of the potential motivation of so-called \u2018steam\nage poachers\u2019 but also the growing regional specialisation in game preservation\nduring the period and the different opportunities, and obstacles, this presented for\npoaching.\nInterpretations of nineteenth-century poaching\nApart from two important national surveys by Jones and Hopkins1 and a case study of\nsouth-westLancashire byArcher,2 studies of poaching have concentrated on southern and\neastern counties: Sussex,Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Devon, Suffolk andNorfolk.3 Although\nsome have argued that motives were often much more complex than mere survival,4 the\nhistoriography has nevertheless also emphasised a strong causative association between\nthe emergence of poaching on a large scale and the casualisation and degradation of the\nlandless, agrarian labour force in England\u2019s cereal heartlands.5 This line of academic\nargument is integral to a broader radical critique of rural social relations and the loss\nof customary rights post-enclosure that can be traced back to the Hammonds.6 Most of\nthe \u2018popular\u2019 literature on, and in some cases by, poachers of the late-Victorian and early\nEdwardian periods has served to confirm this regional concentration, aswell as stereotypes\nof the offenders\u2019 background, character and primary motivation, and supported the view\nthat large sections of the community condoned or supported their activities. Poachers have\nconsequently acquired a reputation, not as criminals, but as downtrodden, agricultural\nlabourers, or as champions of the poor\u2019s customary and natural rights in the face of what\nwas arguably the most blatant expression of indefensible class privilege, the hated Game\nLaws.7\n188 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nThere are apparently logical and defensible grounds for this historiography. Ill feeling\ngenerated by the extensive preservation of game was widespread and poaching cases\ndominated proceedings at rural petty sessions. Most apprehended offenders in southern\ncounties were also agricultural labourers, andmany poachers themselves often argued that\ndistress was the principal cause of their offending. \u2018Poverty is the mother of invention\u2019\ncommented James Hawker, \u2018poverty made me poach\u2019.8 The fact that between eighty\nand ninety per cent of poaching prosecutions were for the relatively minor offence of\n\u2018trespass in pursuit of game during the day-time\u2019, or day poaching, and could be dealt\nwith summarily, might also suggest that this was often not a serious, premeditated crime\nbut one resorted to casually or out of necessity. One in four convictions in Suffolk during\nthe 1840s were for game offences and even as late as the 1880s poaching constituted\ntwenty-two per cent of cases heard by some rural magistrates in Oxfordshire.9\nExplanations of poaching\u2019s decline from the 1870s have consequently also been framed\nwithin these regional and rural perspectives.10 These stress a widespread reformation of\nmanners, growing respectability and \u2018shifts in popular sentiment\u2019 within southern rural\ncommunities whose members became less tolerant of criminals and criminality per se.\nPoaching allegedly became regarded as an inappropriate, unacceptable and irrational\nactivity.11 Demographic change and specifically the \u2018massive outflow of labourers from\nthe land\u2019 has also been stressed, since out-migration often removed younger and possibly\nmore troublesome elements of the population while improving the prospects of those\nwho remained. Perhaps most significantly, improvements in wages and more regular\nemployment in agricultural districts are viewed as undermining the need to poach\n\u2018for the pot\u2019. Howkins, for example, considered rising standards of living among the\nrural poor to be the \u2018first and most important\u2019 explanation of poaching\u2019s decline while\nJones has pointed to a \u2018calculated social welfare programme\u2019 for the poor including the\nprovision of allotments. Jones has also argued that potential poachers were deterred by\nthe \u2018considerable increases in police numbers\u2019 in rural districts from the 1860s, their use\nof surveillance powers enshrined in the Poaching Prevention Act, and their acceptance\nby the farming community.12 This interpretation is compatible with Gatrell\u2019s wider\nargument about the emergence of a \u2018policeman-state\u2019, which he credits for much of the\ndecline in real and recorded crime in late Victorian England.13 The Ground Game Act of\n1880 is also seen as significant in this context. By granting farmers the \u2018unalienable\u2019 right\nto shoot rabbits and hares on their land, this legislation is credited with recruiting them\nas law enforcers, willing to prosecute or report poachers whom they had often previously\ntolerated as welcome exterminators of furred vermin. It also meant that fewer tenant\nfarmers were themselves prosecuted for game offences.14\nNational and regional trends in poaching\nThese assumptions about the regional concentration of poaching have never been\nsystematically challenged or tested quantitatively. For much of the century such a\nchallenge is not possible since there are no reliable, comparative quantitative data on\nprosecutions, and none that relate to summary proceedings. Occasional official attempts\nto collect statistics occurred particularly in the 1820s and 1840s but these fell short of\nachieving comprehensive or reliable returns.15 From 1858, however, the annual returns\nRural and Urban Poaching 189\nof comprehensive, judicial statistics by the new county and borough police forces,\nrecording the number of cases brought before all the courts, enable a more informed\nanalysis to be undertaken. The reliability and use of such judicial statistics are, of course,\nfrequently challenged. Some have argued that they bore, and bear, little relationship to\n\u2018real\u2019 levels of offending because there is a \u2018dark figure\u2019 of undetected and unrecorded\ncrime. Nevertheless, studies of poaching have relied extensively on local case studies\nof court cases to sustain their arguments about the level, nature and significance of\nthe crime in rural districts and the background and motivations of the poachers. The\nproportion of crime that went undetected may well have changed over time, but there\nis no reason to suggest it differed substantially across the country in ways that would\nundermine regional comparisons. Nor are trends in poaching cases likely to have been the\nconsequence of bureaucratic, procedural and financial aspects of the prosecution process\nsuch as those suggested by Taylor which affected the police\u2019s approach to serious crimes\nlike murder, since prosecutions for day and night poaching were invariably brought by\ngame proprietors and their keepers who had a direct interest in their outcome.16 Gatrell\nhas also convincingly argued that there is a strong case for believing that judicial statistics\nfor theft and violence were an accurate reflection of temporal trends in crime itself during\nthe nineteenth century.17\nStatistics collected after 1858 show that poaching prosecutions in England continued\nto rise throughout the 1860s from around 9,000 in 1860 to just over 11,700 ten years\nlater. After dipping sharply in the early 1870s to just over 8,600, they then resumed their\nupward trend, peaking in 1877 at just under 12,400 cases.18 After that, despite temporary\nreversals, there was a steady national decline, with cases virtually halving over the next\ntwenty-five years (Figure 1). Jones\u2019s view is that this peak in prosecutions in the mid-\n1870s represented an all-time high, despite the bitterness that characterised the notorious\n\u2018poaching wars\u2019 of the late-Georgian and early-Victorian periods. The occasional official\nattempts to collect national figures for these earlier periods indicate that, even in the\ndark decade of the 1840s, prosecutions were running at perhaps only half the level of the\nmid-1870s.19\nDay poaching offences, dealt with summarily at petty sessions, accounted for eighty\nto ninety per cent of poaching cases throughout the period and were consequently the\ndominant influence on overall figures. They were almost entirely responsible for the\nnational peak in the 1870s and the subsequent marked decline (Figure 2). Despite the\nfear and controversy that night poaching aroused and the high-profile coverage which\nthe local and national press gave to serious cases involving assaults on gamekeepers,\nprosecutions for this offence rarely exceeded five per cent of cases in the second half of the\nnineteenth century and the figure declined steadily from the 1860s. A different pattern\nagain is evident for offences under the Poaching Prevention Act of 1862, the only offence\nfor which the police were responsible for initiating proceedings. These fluctuated over\nthe period, with a discernible peak in the late 1870s, but they were at much the same level\nin the 1900s as they had been forty years earlier (Figure 3).\nA regional breakdown of these poaching figures, however, reveals that, far from being\nprimarily a characteristic of agricultural counties, industrialising and mining counties of\nthe North and Midlands accounted for a significant proportion of cases.

Night poaching and poaching prevention act: offences in England, 1862\u20131901.\nRural and Urban Poaching 193\n(1865\u20139), for example, there were around two to three times as many prosecutions for\nday poaching in the West Riding of Yorkshire (3,698), Durham (2,053) and Lancashire\n(2,110) than in Norfolk (1,204), Suffolk (1,378) and Essex (1,386). Over a quarter of\nday poaching cases in England were accounted for by just six counties (West Riding,\nLancashire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Durham and Cheshire). The same counties were\nresponsible for an even higher proportion (thirty-seven per cent) of night poaching and\ncases brought under the Poaching Prevention Act (thirty per cent) during the same\nperiod. Such counties were also the major influence on national trends over the next\nthirty years. The dramatic peak in day prosecutions that occurred in the late 1870s can be\nexplained entirely by reference to a relatively small number of counties in the North and\nMidlands. Between 1872 and 1876 prosecutions for day poaching rose by 167 per cent in\nNorthumberland, 125 per cent in Durham, 114 per cent in Lancashire, ninety-nine per\ncent in theWest Riding of Yorkshire, eighty-three per cent in Northamptonshire, eighty-\ntwo per cent inWarwick, eighty per cent in Derby, seventy-two per cent in Staffordshire,\nsixty-six per cent in Cheshire, sixty-four per cent in Nottinghamshire and fifty-nine\nper cent in Leicestershire. Industrialising counties were also responsible for the equally\ndramatic fall in prosecutions from the late 1870s (Figure 4).20\nBy contrast, prosecutions in the agricultural South and East failed to reflect national\ntrends. During the late 1870s they were consistently lower than they had been a decade\nearlier. Between 1865\u20139 and 1875\u20139, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and\nHuntingdonshire recorded falls in excess of thirty per cent with only three counties\nwitnessing any increases: Oxford (four per cent), Norfolk (one per cent) and Hampshire\n(half per cent). Conversely, when national figures started to fall, prosecutions in these\ncounties actually rose by over a quarter between 1877 and the mid-1880s, reaching a\npeak in 1885 which was twenty-five per cent higher than the early 1860s. Even in the\nmid-1890s prosecutions for day poaching in many south-eastern counties were still little\ndifferent, and in a few cases were actually higher than the mid-1870s. Only after the\nturn of the century did they consistently fall below levels recorded thirty years earlier.\nSouth-western counties fell between these two extremes, exhibiting more modest rises in\nboth the 1870s and 1880s with declines in between these peaks.\nNight poaching exhibited similar regional patterns, although the national peak for\nthis offence occurred during the early 1860s, largely because of exceptional numbers\nof prosecutions in Lancashire and Cheshire during the cotton famine. Offences under\nthe Poaching Prevention Act also declined in the North from as early as the 1860s but\nwere increasingly reported further south by the 1880s. The cumulative impact of these\nchanges meant that total prosecutions for poaching between the late 1870s and late 1890s\nfell by over sixty per cent in Cheshire, Cumberland, Derbyshire, Durham, Lancashire,\nLeicester, Northumberland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Westmorland and Yorkshire and\nby over fifty per cent in Nottinghamshire, but by less than twenty per cent in most\nsouthern counties (Figure 5).\nThis regional differentiation is even more pronounced when population changes are\ntaken into account.On the one hand, prosecution rates clearly demonstratewhat historians\nhave argued was the case earlier in the century: that the crime rate for this offence was\nmuch higher in the southern counties. In increasingly urban counties, where there was\n194\nH\narvey\nO\nsborne\nand\nM\nichaelW\ninstanley\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n1862 1864 1866 1868 1870 1872 1874 1876 1878 1880 1882 1884 1886 1888 1890 1892 1894 1896 1898 1900\nYear\nP\nr\no\ns\ne\nc\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\nNorth South East South West\nFigure 4.

Falling populations in rural areas may have contributed to the marginal\nfall which occurred in absolute numbers of prosecutions over the period, but there was no\nmarked decline in the incidence of poaching among the resident populationwho remained.\n196 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nIt is inconceivable that such marked regional differences and temporal patterns were\ngenerated solely by chance. Their clarity and long-term consistency strongly suggest that\nthey reflected real differences in experiences and that poaching cannot be considered or\nexplained solely, or even primarily, as a crime associated with agricultural districts in\nsouthern and eastern counties.\nThe industrial poacher\nHigh levels of poaching in the North and Midlands cannot be explained by reference\nto agrarian social structures, hiring practices or levels of agricultural workers\u2019 wages.\nFurthermore, northern agricultural workers\u2019 incentives and opportunities to poach were\nconsiderably less than their counterparts further south. Not only were they more likely\nto experience restrictions on their freedom as living-in farm servants, but they enjoyed\nbetter living standards throughout the century.21\nContemporary observers agreed that poachers in these regions were not agricultural\nworkers, but were primarily drawn from the ranks of industrial workers such as weavers,\nframework knitters, potters, colliers, masons andmetal workers, who lived either in towns\nor in the numerous smaller industrial and mining communities which were established\nfrom the late eighteenth century.22 As Archer noted, poaching here was \u2018a rural crime\nin an urbanizing environment\u2019.23 One West Riding farmer observed: \u2018There are very\nfew [agricultural] labourers who are poachers. They are chiefly of another class, colliers\nand manufacturers and masons and delve men and quarry men and hand-spinners \u2013\nthey can make their nets cheap\u2019.24 Articles and biographical sketches of gamekeepers\nin the late-Victorian professional journal, The Gamekeeper, invariably identified the\ngreatest threats to game preservation as occurring on estates close to significant urban\nsettlements or coalfields.25 Colliers were seen as the most innovative, cunning and\ndangerous poachers. One headkeeper recalled that, in his youth on a single-handed\nestate \u2018in the North Country\u2019, he was plagued by poachers and that he still had \u2018sundry\nscars, the relics of bruises and cuts inflicted by that favourite weapon of the collier, his\nclog\u2019.26\nThese contemporary opinions of the northern poachers\u2019 industrial background receive\nsubstantial support from the qualitative evidence collected by Hopkins and Jones, while\nArcher\u2019s quantitative study found that the overwhelming preponderance of poachers\nbrought before the courts in south-west Lancashire estates resided in urban areas,\nparticularly Liverpool.27 Surviving petty sessions records for Kirkham, a small market\ntown to the west of Preston, and Higher Blackburn to the east in the 1860s also confirm\nthis connection with industrial and urban workers.28 The \u2018labourers\u2019 who dominated\nproceedings atKirkhamwere not locals; two thirds gave their place of residence as Preston\nwith the rest scattered throughout the Fylde area. In the area to the east of Blackburn,\n\u2018labourers\u2019 accounted for less than half of the offenders, with the rest drawn from specific\ntrades in textiles, coal mining and a variety of crafts. Over two thirds of those prosecuted\nhere were from the three major industrial settlements in the area: Burnley, Padiham and\nClitheroe.\nThis correlation between poaching and urban or industrial areas in Lancashire is\nreplicated elsewhere in the North and parts of the Midlands. In 1864 the government\nRural and Urban Poaching 197\ncommissioned a survey of all poaching offences brought before petty sessions and higher\ncourts between 1857 and 1863.29 In most cases, the returns supplied precise information\nabout the locations at which the crimes were committed, enabling a remarkably detailed\npicture of their spatial distribution to be constructed. This confirms that areas dominated\nby textiles, heavy industry and mining witnessed significant concentrations of poaching.\nIn Lancashire, for example, poaching was common around St Helens,Wigan, Blackburn,\nBurnley, Haslingden and Chorley. In Cheshire, estates to the south of Stockport and\naround Macclesfield were the prime targets for poachers from these towns. In Cumbria,\nthere were few prosecutions in central Lakeland or the rich agricultural plains to\nthe west of Carlisle but significant clusters close to the industrial towns of the west\ncoast, Carlisle itself, the decaying weaving town of Brampton, and the market towns\nof Penrith, Kendal, Cockermouth and Appleby. Over the border in the West Riding\nof Yorkshire, north to Durham and Northumberland, and south into Derbyshire and\nNottinghamshire, poaching was most common on coalfields, as it was in Somerset (see\nFigure 6).\nClearly, therefore, views of poaching predicated on the assumption that it was primarily\na phenomenon rooted in agricultural communities, largely those located in southern and\neastern England, are, at best, partial, at worst, misleading. Explanations of poaching\u2019s\nincidence, of the marked national peak in prosecutions during the 1870s, and of the\nsubsequent dramatic decline must be sought elsewhere in an understanding of the\nbehaviour of so-called \u2018steam age poachers\u2019.30 Their motivations are clearly integral to\nsuch explanations, but equally significant was the availability of opportunities to poach,\nopportunities which were radically transformed by revolutionary developments in the\nnature and location of game preservation and field sports themselves in the late nineteenth\ncentury.\nThe accessibility of game: regional specialisation in preservation\nThe changing geography of poaching broadly mirrored that of game preservation itself.\nThe numbers of gamekeepers returned in the decennial censuses is a useful surrogate\nmeasure of this. The census of 1851, the first to classify keepers as a separate occupation,\nrecordedmore in Lancashire and theWest Riding of Yorkshire than any other counties.31\nTwenty years later, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Durham, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire\nand Nottingham alone still employed twenty-five per cent of England\u2019s gamekeepers.\nTheir distribution within these counties also suggests that the majority of them were\nemployed on what Hopkins characterised as \u2018closely preserved estates\u2019 adjacent to \u2018fast\ngrowing industrial agglomerations\u2019 rather than in the less sparsely populated agricultural,\ncoastal and moorland regions.32 This reflected the fact that much of the demand for game\nshooting was likely to have been met locally. This \u2018juxtaposition of the game estates to\nthe towns and cities\u2019 was also specifically noted by Archer as a major cause of intensive\ngame conflict in early-Victorian Lancashire.33 It was also widely recognised at the time as\na problem by the increasingly organised gamekeeping profession who regularly referred\nto the problems of trying to preserve game close to centres of population, particularly\nin mining districts.34 A letter to The Times in 1876, referring to a particularly violent\n198\nH\narvey\nO\nsborne\nand\nM\nichaelW\ninstanley\nFigure 6. Poaching offences in central Lancashire, 1857\u201363.\nRural and Urban Poaching 199\nincident which had occurred at Gloddaeth, midway between Conway and Llandudno,\nvividly described the problem which faced such estates:\nIt occupies, therefore, a sort of suburban position with regard to either of these places. The whole\ndistrict teems with sailors, miners, quarrymen, rough mountaineers, and the irregular population\nthat ministers to the wants of the tourist class and in so doing becomes well acquainted with the\ncountry. . . . Is it possible for an owner of an old place to keep up, in such circumstances, the making\nof country life these days?35\nBy the third quarter of the century, however, it is clear that game preservers\nwere increasingly choosing to pursue this aspect of \u2018country life\u2019 in more congenial\nsurroundings, untroubled by the threats posed by industrial and urban expansion.\nWithin Lancashire, for example, the Earl of Sefton, whose estates surrounded Liverpool,\ndeveloped what became the best grouse shooting estate in Lancashire in the remote valley\nand moors of Upper Wyresdale in the north of the county. Much of the Cliftons\u2019 estate\nat Lytham, once prized for its shooting, was laid out as a seaside resort and golf links.\nThe laying down of arable fields to grass over much of the county also undermined\nopportunities for shooting, while the annual influx of wild duck was reduced by the\ndraining of Lancastrian moss land.36 A steel works replaced warreners who were recorded\nas resident in Trafford Park outside Manchester in the 1881 census, after the opening of\ntheManchester ShipCanal in the 1890s. The storywas replicated overmuch of theNorth.\nGame preservation over much of the Staffordshire coalfield, for example, was reported\nto have ceased by the early 1870s.37 Northern estates which continued to produce driven\nshooting on a grand scale, such as Lambton Castle (Durham), Chatsworth (Derbyshire),\nEatonHall (Cheshire), CastleHoward, andStudley Park (NorthYorkshire), were situated\naway from centres of population.\nAs pressure from urban expansion and industrial development grew, established\nlandowners and the new commercial and manufacturing classes often preferred, and\nin some cases were obliged, to pursue their sport in the more congenial environments of\nnew \u2018sporting estates\u2019, ideally situated well away from centres of population, or even in\nthe \u2018big game\u2019 reserves in the imperial vastnesses of Africa and Asia.38 After 1870 the\nexpansion of sporting estates in the North occurred in the remote, sparsely populated\nupland moors of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire and Northumberland, the valleys\nof North Wales and the grouse moors and deer forests of the Scottish Highlands, all\nas yet largely undisturbed by ramblers.39 Here the lack of people was often specifically\nsingled out in sale particulars for estates as a major attraction and new hunting \u2018lodges\u2019\nwith all the modern conveniences were erected for extended stays, not just for the\nowner and his acquaintances but also for wealthy customers who paid for shooting\nrights.\nOver the same period, the pursuit of pheasant shooting became increasingly\nconcentrated in, and associated with, the less heavily populated counties within easy\nreach of London. The capital\u2019s burgeoning commercial success generated the wealth\nto purchase, develop or lease sporting estates which were being developed on land\nwhich was becoming increasingly marginal for cereal production as the agricultural\ndepression deepened. Across a broad swathe of England south of the Wash, particularly\n200 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nin Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Berkshire, Hertfordshire and East Anglia, new\nlandscapes were formed, specifically to provide the conditions for driven shooting on a\ngrand scale.40 It was at this time that East Anglia in particular emerged as England\u2019s\npremier pheasant and partridge shooting region, \u2018a land of game, beyond any others in\nEngland\u2019, where apprentice gamekeeperswere increasingly advised to go \u2018to learn your job\nproperly\u2019. Novel artificial rearing techniques such as the Euston and Elveden hatching\nsystems were named after the East Anglian estates on which they were developed.41\n\u2018Wondrous improvements in our fire-arms\u2019, especially the widespread adoption of the\nbreech-loading shotgun after 1865, facilitated a massive expansion in driven shooting.42\nBy the end of Gladstone\u2019s second ministry, over half a million pheasants were being shot\neach year,most of them, if reports are to be believed, in the South of England.43 On leading\nestates like Elveden, Rendlesham (Suffolk), SixMile Bottom (Cambridgeshire), Holkham\nand Sandringham (Norfolk), escalating numbers of winged and ground game were reared\nand despatched by the great shots of the day, such LordWalsingham, Maharajah Duleep\nSing and the Prince of Wales, in an increasingly competitive annual round of \u2018grande\nbattues\u2019 which only came to an end in 1914.44 On the Benacre Hall estate, near Lowestoft,\nnearly 17,000 head of game were shot in the late 1890s, compared to just 3,400 eighty\nyears earlier. Elveden estate smashed all previous records in the 1885\u20136 season with a\nstaggering 81,877 head. Unlike the remote northern grouse moors, such estates offered\npotentially rich pickings for poachers.\nThis regional restructuring of the game industry is reflected in the census. Between\n1871 and 1911, the number of gamekeepers in Lancashire fell from 544 to 482, in\nCheshire from 366 to 304 and in West Yorkshire from 640 to 602. Only in Cumberland,\nWestmorland and Northumberland, where there was an expansion of upland grouse\nmoors, were there any significant increases in the North. In contrast to the decline\nor stagnation witnessed in increasingly industrial counties, gamekeepers increased by\nover forty per cent in Wales and by even more in Denbighshire, Flint and along the\nWelsh Marches. They nearly doubled in Scotland from just over 3,500 to just under\n6,000, reflecting the substantial expansion of game and stalking estates along the Scottish\nBorders and in the western and central Highlands.45 Even more marked increases were\nrecorded in the counties of South-East England. Norfolk, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, Essex,\nHampshire, Kent, Sussex and Surrey, which had employed twenty-four per cent of\nEngland\u2019s gamekeepers in 1871, increased their share to thirty-six per cent by 1911. Over\nthe same period the numbers employed in Hampshire increased from 529 to 980, in\nKent from 427 to 606, in Norfolk from 648 to 1,202 and in Suffolk from 457 to 913 (see\nFigures 7 and 8).\nThe culture of poaching\nThis restructuring, commercialisation and relocation of game preservation in the late\nnineteenth century clearly undermined opportunities for urban and industrial poaching,\nbut it is not a total explanation of the high incidence of the crime in the North and\nMidlands up to the 1870s; nor is it sufficient to account for the speed with which the\ncrime declined thereafter. An understanding of the motivations of the industrial poacher\nhimself is also required.\nR\nuraland\nU\nrban\nP\noaching\n201\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1851 1871 1891 1911\nCensus Year\nN\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\ns\nCheshire Lancashire York: W.

Percentage change in gamekeepers, 1871\u20131911 (white area=decline).\nThe appeal of poaching for some was doubtlessly akin to that which attracted those\nlegitimately entitled to kill it. They enjoyed the thrill and excitement of the \u2018sport\u2019 and\nthe accompanying interaction and involvement with the countryside and natural world.46\nSuch attitudes were not restricted to rural inhabitants or to southern and eastern England.\nMany of the urban poachers that Archer identified in Lancashire during the early to\nmid-nineteenth century still had country skills and familial links with the countryside.47\nMiners and other northern industrial workers had a long tradition of celebrating poaching\nin songs and oral tradition in much the same way as the shoemakers of Beccles or the\nRural and Urban Poaching 203\nrabbiting craftsmen and sailors of Ipswich.48 Poaching was also integrally linked to other\nsports such as coursing and dog-racing which were both particularly popular in mining\ncommunities.49\n\u2018Legitimate\u2019 field sports of many kinds, including the following of hounds, continued\nto attract a dedicated following of industrial workers late into the century, particularly\nin the North East and parts of the Lake Counties, while whippet keeping remained\npopular among northern miners.50 But the development of a distinctive, urban working-\nclass culture in the closing years of the century undoubtedly undermined the traditional\nappeal of the \u2018great game\u2019 for those born and bred in an urban environment.51 The\ncommercial cultures of spectator and participatory sports, mass leisure activities such as\nthe seaside holiday, and domestically-oriented hobbies in the last quarter of the century\narewell documented.The culture ofmining villages, too,was transformedby co-operative\nsocieties, working men\u2019s halls, clubs, institutes, reading rooms and chapels which served\nto transform the image of the collier from the fun-loving \u2018Bob Cranky\u2019 into the sober\nrespectable stereotype of \u2018Jack Spring\u2019.52\nTwo activities in particular arguably stand out as providing themost direct competition\nto the \u2018sporting\u2019 or recreational appeal of poaching. First, there was the growth of\nalternative outdoor activities, team and individual sports, which offered contact with\nthe natural world and countryside: rambling, cycling, running, dog-racing, angling\nand competitive shooting clubs. Significantly, one of the few occasions when James\nHawker abandoned poaching was when \u2018Riding . . . was all the go\u2019 and his \u2018attention was\ndrawn to cycling\u2019.53 During the 1880s huge crowds attended \u2018park\u2019 or \u2018enclosed\u2019 hare-\ncoursing meetings run by commercial companies on estates like Haydock, Kempton,\nand Gosforth (Newcastle) before they were converted into racecourses. In the mid-\n1880s \u2018rabbit coursing, with a peculiar little breed of whippet\u2019 was also common\nin the Potteries and around Manchester.54 Competitive \u2018harrier\u2019 running clubs with\nlarge working-class memberships emerged from the 1870s, particularly in the poaching\nstrongholds of the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire.55 Equally significant were\nthe competitive mass angling clubs that developed in industrial areas, particularly around\nSheffield.56\nSecond, the late nineteenth century witnessed the growth of \u2018domestic game keeping\u2019:\nthe selective breeding and rearing of \u2018fancy\u2019 fowl (poultry), rabbits, cage-birds and racing\npigeons. Encouraged by the availability of surplus income and cheap grain, these became\nan integral part of working-class life in northern andmidland industrial towns and colliery\nvillages, pursued in sheds, back yards, gardens and allotments.57 Such hobbies not only\nprovided opportunities for continuing involvement with \u2018wild\u2019 creatures, they could be\nfiercely competitive activities, with individuals displaying their prized possessions at\nregular shows, or, in the case of pigeons, entering them in long-distance homing races.\nThey also gave individuals pride and status within their communities, a sense of control\nover their lives and a chance to develop associations and shared interests.58 Popular\nmagazines emerged to cater for their interests, several of them, including Fur and Feather\n(1890), The British Fancier, or Kennel, Poultry, Pigeon & Pet Stock Review (1892) and\nPigeons (1904), published not in London, but in Bradford and Manchester. The growth\nof such pursuits reflected a wider urban cultural transformation in attitudes towards the\n204 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nnatural world, which manifested itself in organisations devoted to the conservation of\nwild life, and the keeping of domesticated birds and small mammals as pets.59\nThe growing contrast between commercial northern-urban and traditional southern-\nrural cultural experiences was never absolute, but such new pursuits appear to be far\nless evident in agricultural districts where work and leisure were still fundamentally\nbound up with the seasonal calendar, and a \u2018hedgerow leisure\u2019 culture undoubtedly\nendured longer. Rural values were far more complex, and probably underwent less\nsusceptible change, than those portrayed by Arch, Ashby and Thompson, themselves\ntangible, and possibly atypical, manifestations of late Victorian rural respectability. Even\nif some in the cereal heartlands gravitated toward established religion and practical\nforms of self-improvement, or were incorporated into the social welfare programmes\nof benevolent landowners and employers, there is no evidence of a lessening of hostility\nto the game laws.60 Indeed, sober, religious and regularly-employed sections of rural\nsociety, trade unionists and Methodist preachers, remained among their fiercest critics\neven if they were the least likely to actually participate in poaching themselves.\nHowkins also has shown just how far differentiation among southern labourers has\nbeen underestimated and how distinctions between rough and respectable remained\nvalid.61 Despite the introduction of compulsory schooling, the formative experiences of\nthe young in such areas were only marginally different from those of earlier generations.62\nThe working and recreational experiences of childhood continued to serve as an\napprenticeship, not just to the ways of the country in general, but to the specific skills of\npoaching.\nThe low incomes in agricultural districts allowed for little of the non-essential spending\nwhich underpinned the commercialisation of leisure elsewhere. East Anglian biographies\nof the time, as well as the later oral histories collected by Ewart Evans, suggest that\ncommercial entertainments, outside the travelling circus or fair, penetrated into rural\nareas relatively late.63 Club sports were rare. Informal recreations involving the natural\nworld continued to dominate. Baldry (Norfolk) and Hawker (Northamptonshire) both\nsuggest that poaching remained a major source of amusement in agricultural areas, in\nwhich the young indulged almost as a rite of passage.64 The fact that there was not a\nsignificant fall in prosecutions in many rural areas, particularly East Anglia, may suggest\nthat a hard core of offenders in these areas were unmoved by moral reformation about\nthem, or that, equally, there were other factors which continued to sustain the rural\npopulation\u2019s propensity to poach.\nThe economics of poaching\nThe relationship between poaching and living standards provides another compelling\nexplanation both of the high level of poaching in industrial areas and of its dramatic\ndecline. Archer, Hopkins and Thompson have followed some contemporary observers in\nrejecting the view that urban poaching was a response to poverty, and maintained that\nit was driven by a thriving commercial market for game which was at its height during\ntimes of prosperity rather than depression.65 This view of poachers as market-conscious\ncriminals, however, runs counter to the accepted interpretation of other nineteenth-\ncentury property crimes and to interpretations of poaching in the South, which stress\nRural and Urban Poaching 205\nthat the poor resorted to poaching to counter the effects of low working-class standards\nof living, depressed wages, and poor employment prospects.66\nThere is much to support Jones\u2019s impressionistic view, derived from literary evidence,\nthat \u2018poaching was a popular response of the urban peasantry to changes in living\nstandards\u2019.67 Although we lack reliable data on both wages and prosecutions before the\n1860s, it is significant that the years when concerns about poaching were at their height \u2013\nthe immediate post-war years after 1815, the mid-1820s, early 1840s and early 1860s \u2013\nwere all years of severe depression in textile and mining districts.\nThe relationship between poaching activity and fluctuations in the industrial labour\nmarket is most clearly evident during and after the 1870s. The early years of the decade\nwitnessed a speculative boom in manufacturing and unparalleled investment in mining\nresulting in an unprecedented period of prosperity for workers. Miners\u2019 wages rose by\nas much as fifty per cent in just three years.68 Witnesses before the Select Committee on\nthe Game Laws in 1872\u20133 credited this prosperity with the marked decline in poaching\nduring the period. Thomas Muirhead, a Manchester game dealer, observed that, \u2018In our\ndistrict colliers used to go in gangs 10 to 12 miles aroundManchester, but you never hear\nof them now . . . They can get much more from raising coals than what they can get in\ntaking game, I should think.\u2019 \u2018Increased employment\u2019 meant that \u2018game is no temptation\nto them now.\u2019 Captain Congreve, Chief Constable of Staffordshire, also remarked that,\n\u2018there are very few men who are in regular work who poach much; there may be a few\nwho occasionally work as colliers who poach, but only a few\u2019.69\nFrom 1874, however, the British industrial economy experienced what was possibly\nits worst depression of the century. Demand collapsed and prices plummeted, resulting\nin massive layoffs, short-time working, cuts in piece rates and widespread, unsuccessful\nindustrial unrest. Mining was particularly badly hit. All the advances of the early 1870s\nwere lost as real earnings fell to levels not seen since the 1840s and the bulk of the colliers\ntaken on during the speculative boom were sacked.70 In the Black Country, real incomes\nfell to almost a quarter of their level in the 1850s. A severe, protracted depression also\nhit the textile districts of Lancashire and Yorkshire with bankruptcies, lay-offs and wage\ncuts peaking in 1877\u20139.71 The Economist described 1879 as a year of \u2018general difficulty,\ndepression and disaster\u2019 in the wool textile industry, the worst \u2018that this generation has\nseen\u2019.72 Here, too, there were lay-offs, unsuccessful strikes, and dramatic declines in union\nmembership. It was the industrial counties affected by this collapse which experienced the\nunprecedented and rapid increase in the number of poaching prosecutions, particularly\nthe coalfields of North-East England, Lancashire, Staffordshire, the East Midlands.73\nConversely, the marked decline in the 1880s coincided with rapid increases in money\nwages in these areas.\nThe problems of low money wages and irregularity of industrial employment before\nthe 1880s had been exacerbated by high meat prices.74 For most of the century, beef\nand mutton were considered to be too expensive to form part of the workers\u2019 basic diet.\nGround game \u2013 rabbit and hare \u2013 was consequently widely reported as being viewed as\nan economical alternative by workers and artisans.75 The police themselves recognised\nthis. \u2018There is nothing that poor people prize more than rabbits; it is the only change of\ndiet they have\u2019, while a hare was \u2018as heavy as a leg of mutton and half the money;\u2019 and\n206 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nthere was also money back on the skin.76 This demand meant that there was a thriving\nurban market for such game, legal or illegal. The Chief Constable of Newcastle, whose\nprevious experience was in Norfolk, felt that it was much easier to dispose of ground\ngame in northern centres.77 Not surprisingly, chief constables also maintained that most\npoaching in the North was related to the taking of ground game, usually with dogs or\nnets, rather than the more complicated business of taking and disposing of winged game.\n\u2018Rabbits and hares are in greater abundance and easily caught; another reason ground\ngame is so much sought for is, that they can sell them without a game licence; there is\nan enormous consumption of them\u2019.78 \u2018To take feathered game requires a much higher\ndegree of skill and organisation, and better materials altogether; it is more dangerous to\ngo out night poaching because men must have guns if they do not have a very extensive\nsystem of nets\u2019.79 The slump of the mid-1870s, therefore, can also be viewed as the last\nmajor food crisis since beef and mutton prices were still high while rabbit and hare prices\nwere also rising significantly, reflecting a shortage of supply in some districts.80\nFrom the mid-1880s, however, the price of alternative meats began to fall in response\nto the influx of cheap chilled and frozen imports, sold through specialist multiples\nand cooperative stores. These both boosted consumption and undermined working-\nclass demand for cheaper ground game.81 Significantly, this import penetration had a\nstrong regional dimension. It was particularly evident in London, and throughout the\nindustrial North and Midlands, but was largely absent in rural areas.82 At the same time,\nthe market for game, ground and winged, also became more specialised and structured,\npossibly reducing the opportunities for small-scale commercial poachers to dispose of\ntheir hauls on the open market. Substantial wholesalers emerged, importing rabbits\nin large quantities from Ireland, Europe and from Australia, or buying directly from\nlandlords who increasingly sold winged and ground game to dealers.83 Furthermore, the\n1880s witnessed the rapid expansion of alternative supplies of domestic and market-bred\npoultry, especially in Lancashire and the West Riding, facilitated by the importation of\ncheap grain.84 These economic developments clearly undermined much of the industrial\nworkers\u2019 previous incentives to poach, whether for subsistence or for commercial\ngain. Unsurprisingly, prosecutions for poaching plummeted precisely in areas of the\ncountry where the late nineteenth-century revolution in food supply and diet was most\nevident.\nThere were no sustained rises in wages or improved employment prospects for\nagricultural workers in the crisis-ridden, low-wage, corn growing regions. During the\n1870s, labourers\u2019 real earnings remained relatively buoyant after the successes of 1870\u2013\n72, and prosecution levels here failed to reflect the national peak of the mid-1870s.\nAs the farming depression deepened in the 1880s, however, and agricultural wages\ndeclined, particularly in the eastern arable counties, prosecutions rose, in some cases\nquite dramatically and to levels similar to, or some cases (Essex, Berkshire, Norfolk and\nSuffolk) in excess of, levels recorded twenty years earlier. Continuing high prices for\nbasic foodstuffs in a less competitive retail environment, and farmers\u2019 reluctance to allow\nlabourers to keep poultry for fear that they would steal grain to feed them, also served to\nsustain the need to poach ground and winged game to supplement a limited diet. Only at\nthe very end of the century, when agricultural workers\u2019 incomes in these counties again\nRural and Urban Poaching 207\nmatched or exceeded those that they had enjoyed in the 1870s, did poaching prosecutions\nshow evidence of sustained decline.85\nConclusion\nIt is clear, therefore, that current explanations of the incidence and decline of poaching\nin the nineteenth century that focus on largely agricultural districts need to be revised\nin the light of these marked regional discrepancies in experience. The crime was much\nmore common in industrial, urban counties of the North and Midlands than has been\npreviously acknowledged. Indeed, it was these counties which both precipitated the peak\nin the 1870s and account for the dramatic subsequent decline in prosecutions. Changes\nin the industrial labour market were clearly a major determinant of these trends, but it\nhas also been suggested here that the illegitimate pursuit of game fulfilled deeper needs\nfor \u2018sport\u2019 or engagement with nature and the countryside, a need which first and second\ngeneration industrial workers could fulfil as long as game estates continued to operate close\nto centres of population and poaching skills and cultures endured. The development of\na recognisably urban working-class culture in the last quarter of the century, therefore,\nmay well have contributed to the declining appeal of poaching.\nIt was not just poachers\u2019 activities, however, that were transformed over the century.\nThe changing regional geography of the crime mirrored a revolution in the nature,\nextent and location of game preservation. As with poaching, game preservation cannot be\nconsidered entirely within the confines of rural society. Much of the investment in game\npreserves, and demand for shooting, came not from owners of agricultural estates, but\nfrom the nouveaux riches.The market for consumption of game was also not just rural but\nurban, and was not confined to food. The capital required to develop and exploit game\nestates, the employment of gamekeepers, the methods of production and the growth of\nsuppliers offering specialist equipment and feedstuffs meant that game itself took on the\nform of an industry.\nThe nature and significance of this transformation have been little appreciated or\nexplored and would merit further investigation. For the poacher it clearly affected access\nto game, while the expansion of artificial rearing of pheasants and partridges meant that\nit was increasingly difficult for both offenders and the wider community to claim that\nthese birds were wild and consequently \u2018fair game\u2019. Strict preservation also heralded a\nrevolution in attitudes to game on the part of the estate owners and sportsmen, which\nin turn increased the number of gamekeepers employed for operating and policing the\nsporting estates. The expansion in the supply of game also influenced its value for both\npoacher and preserver, whether this is construed as amarket price for meat, fur or feather,\nor its importance as a potential source of food. This in turn raises issues related to the\nextent to which the period witnessed a shift between subsistence and market-oriented\npoaching, how the nature of the illegal urban market operated, and ways in which these\nwere affected by the availability of alternative sources of meat and fur.\nAsArcher noted, historians should \u2018bewary of overdrawing distinctions between urban\nand rural crime and criminals\u2019.86 Popular perceptions of the poacher, whether as a villain\nor as a romantic curiosity, whose rural \u2018art\u2019 could be safely incorporated as a novelty into\na \u2018Sports and Pastimes\u2019 exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1893, largely date from the end\n208 Harvey Osborne and Michael Winstanley\nof the century and were part of the period\u2019s construction of \u2018the rural\u2019, the alternative\n\u2018other\u2019 to urban industrialism.87 It was a process whose legacy has largely determined\nhistorians\u2019 assumptions and approaches to the study of the crime which has led to it being\nprimarily associated with agricultural districts in the South and East. This was clearly\nnot the case. Challenging these assumptions about poaching, however, also raises broader\nissues about the way in which studies of the \u2018rural\u2019 and \u2018urban\u2019 have developed along\nseparate lines, rather than concentrating on the porous nature of the urban-rural divide\nthat persisted in many parts of the country.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper has benefited from comments on earlier versions presented to the Agricultural\nHistory Society conference in 2001 and Field Sports conference, Reading University,\n2004; fromProfessors Robert Colls andAlunHowkins, and in particular from the support\nand advice of Dr. John Archer.\n.Notes\n1.
