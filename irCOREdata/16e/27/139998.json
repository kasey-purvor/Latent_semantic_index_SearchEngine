Slow strain rate tests were carried out on \nspecimens coated with electrodeposited cadmium and aluminium-based SermeTel 1140\/962.  \nHydrogen diffusivities were measured using two-cell permeation and galvanostatic charging \nmethods and values of 8.0x10-8 and 1.0x10-9cm2s-1 were obtained for 300M and AerMet100, \nrespectively.  A two-dimensional diffusion model was used to predict the hydrogen distributions \nin the SSR specimens at the time of failure. The superior embrittlement resistance of \nAerMet100 was attributed to reverted austenite forming around martensite laths during \ntempering. \n \n \nKeywords; steel (A), hydrogen permeation (B), galvanostatic (B), hydrogen \nembrittlement (C) \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nWhen high strength steels are protected from corrosion by a sacrificial metallic \ncoating there is an increased risk of failure by hydrogen embrittlement and this can \noccur in two ways.  First, if the coating is applied by electrodeposition a small \nproportion of the plating current produces hydrogen that is reversibly trapped in the \ncoating and then slowly absorbed by the steel. This hydrogen can lead to delayed \nfailure of high strength steel under load and it is the usual practice to bake such \ncomponents for up to 24 hours at 200\u00b0C to remove the hydrogen [1,2].  Failure \nresulting from hydrogen uptake during electroplating is referred to as direct \nembrittlement. \n \nSecond, hydrogen can also be absorbed when a sacrificial coating corrodes in service.  \nIn this case, exposed areas of the steel substrate act as cathodic sites where hydrogen \nis generated by the reduction of water.  If this hydrogen is absorbed in sufficient \nquantities it can also lead to failure of high strength steel and this process is termed \nhydrogen re-embrittlement [3,4]. \n \nThe composition of the sacrificial coating determines the concentration of hydrogen \nproduced at the surface of the exposed steel substrate, with more active metals leading \nto higher hydrogen concentrations.  The structure of the coating is also a factor as a \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 2\ndense layer acts as an effective barrier, whereas a cracked or porous one provides a \nshort circuit path to the steel surface for hydrogen uptake to occur.  The effects of \ncomposition and structure of different sacrificial coatings on direct embrittlement and \nre-embrittlement of high strength steels have been discussed in a previous paper [4]. \n \nThe extent of hydrogen embrittlement generally increases with the tensile strength of \nthe steel [5] but the grain size and the phases present in the microstructure also have \nan important influence by affecting hydrogen trapping and thereby controlling the rate \nof hydrogen uptake [6].  This paper compares the hydrogen embrittlement and re-\nembrittlement of two ultra high strength steels coated with electroplated cadmium and \na non-electrolytic aluminium-based SermeTel 1140\/962 coating.  Slow strain rate \ntensile tests were performed to measure the extent of embrittlement in each \nexperimental condition and the results are discussed in terms of the hydrogen \npermeation rates in the two materials, determined by two electrochemical techniques.  \nFinally, mathematical modeling has been used to relate the uptake of hydrogen in the \ntwo steels to the fractography observed in the tensile tests. \n \n \nMETHODS \n \nMaterials \nThe first steel was 300M (UNS K44220) produced by vacuum arc melting.  It was \ntested in the hardened condition by austenitizing at 870 \u00b0C and oil quenching to room \ntemperature, followed by a double tempering at 315\u00b0C to give a tensile strength of \n2250 MPa.  The second steel was AerMet100 (UNS K92580), which is a high alloy \nsteel containing nickel, cobalt and chromium.  This was heat treated by austenitising \nat 843\u00b0C, oil quenching to room temperature followed by 1 hour at -73\u00b0C to transform \nretained austenite and finally tempered at 485\u00b0C for 5 hours.  The resulting tensile \nstrength was 2100 MPa. The chemical compositions of both alloys are shown in Table \n1. \n  \nThe microstructures of the 300M and AerMet100 steels consisted of lath\/plate \nmartensite with M7C3, M23C6 and \u03b5-carbides distributed within the matrix and at the \nboundaries [7-9].  In 300M, examination in a SEM showed that some retained \naustenite was present at prior austenite grain boundaries.  Retained austenite was also \nvisible in AerMet100 and, in addition, a thin film of reverted austenite had formed at \nlath\/plate boundaries during the final tempering treatment.  In each case, the quantity \nof austenite was too low to be detected by x-ray diffraction.  The same microstructure \nhas been reported in the literature for AerMet100, following similar heat treatments \n[10,11]. The carbides, and the retained and reverted austenite are all known to act as \nstrong hydrogen traps [8,12] and their significance in the microstructure will be \ndiscussed in a later section.  \n \nHydrogen diffusivities \nTwo methods were used to measure the hydrogen diffusion coefficient, D, of the two \nsteels.  The hydrogen permeation technique was suitable for 300M steel but was \ninsufficiently sensitive to measure the lower diffusion coefficient of AerMet100.  \nInstead, a galvanostatic charging technique was adopted, which was satisfactory for \nboth materials. \n   \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 3\nHydrogen permeation technique  The measurements were made using the double \ncell permeation technique of Devanathan and Stachurski [13].  A membrane of the \nsteel, 1mm thick was polished to a 1\u00b5m diamond finish and held between two \nelectrochemical cells with an exposed surface area of 50.3 cm2 on each side.  Both \ncells contained an electrolyte of 0.2 M NaOH solution.  Prior to hydrogen charging, \nthe membrane was depleted of residual hydrogen by holding the exit surface at a \npotential of -0.094 V (SCE) until the current density was lowered to 0.01\u00b5Acm-2.  \nCharging was then carried out on one side only by maintaining the entry surface at a \nconstant potential of -1.250 V (SCE) to promote hydrogen generation and uptake. The \nhydrogen that diffused through the membrane was oxidised and detected on the exit \nside.  After an interval known as the breakthrough time, bt , the oxidation current \ndisplayed a rising transient and eventually reached a steady state value, \u221eJ . \nL\nCDJ o=\u221e             (1) \n \nWhere the D is the hydrogen diffusion coefficient, Co is the constant hydrogen \nconcentration at the charging side of the membrane, and L is the membrane thickness. \nThe aim of the experiment was to measure the hydrogen diffusion coefficient of the \nsteel, which was calculated from the breakthrough time using equation (2) \n.  \nD\nLtb 3.15\n2\n=            (2) \n \nIn this case, the Co value in the charging side of the membrane was not of interest as it \nwas not required to determine D.  Using a potential of -1.250 volts (SCE) and 0.2M \nNaOH electrolyte gave a high rate of hydrogen charging and avoided corrosion on the \nentry side of the steel membrane. \n \nGalvanostatic method  The electrochemical principle of the method has been clearly \nreviewed by Wen et al [14] and its application is reported in several other studies [15-\n17].  The technique involves using a current pulse to cathodically charge a thin sample \nof the material from both sides in a two-electrode cell and record the cell potential \ndifference, E, as a function of time.  The charging current produces a constant flux of \nhydrogen at the electrolyte\/metal interface, x = 0, and the increasing cell voltage that \nis recorded provides a direct measure of the hydrogen activity in the steel at the \ninterface.  Under these experimental conditions the initial and boundary conditions for \na sample of thickness 2L, charged from both sides, are: \n \n C  =  0C    0 \u2264  x \u2264  L ,  t = 0  (3) \n \n \nx\nCD\nd\nd\u2212  = \nzFS\nI   x = 0 ,   t > 0  (4) \n \nx\nC\nd\nd  =  0  x = L ,   t \u2265  0  (5) \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4\nwhere C, t, D and x are the molar hydrogen concentration, diffusion time, hydrogen \ndiffusion coefficient and distance from the metal surface, respectively, and I, S, z and \nF are the charging current, sample area, charge number of the ion reduced in the \nelectrolyte (ie H+) and Faraday\u2019s constant \n \nThe solution of Fick\u2019s second law for one dimensional diffusion can be expressed as \neither error function or trigonometric series.  It can be shown that for very short times, \n(t << L2\/D), the concentration of hydrogen at the interface (as measured by the cell \npotential difference) can be approximated by the first term of the error function series.  \nIn this condition, the potential difference, E, is linearly related to t1\/2, as shown in \nequation (6).  The gradient dE\/dt1\/2 can be obtained from the gradient of the graph of E \nvs t1\/2. \n \n( ) \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= \u03b4\u03c0 d\nd2\nd\nd\n2\/12\/1\nE\nDSFz\nVmI\nt\nE     if \nD\nLt\n2\n<<               (6) \n \nwhere Vm is the molar volume of the steel sample and dE\/d\u03b4 is the change in cell \nvoltage with change in hydrogen concentration. \n \nAt longer times, (t > L2\/D), the surface hydrogen concentration is approximated by \nthe first two terms of the infinite trigonometric series and dE\/dt  is linearly related to \nthe diffusion time, as given in equation (7). \n \n \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u03b4d\nd\nd\nd E\nLSF\nVmI\nt\nE     if  \nD\nLt\n2\n>    (7) \n \nEquations (6) and (7) can be combined to eliminate dE\/d\u03b4 and the diffusion \ncoefficient is then calculated from the gradients dE\/dt1\/2 and dE\/dt  at short and long \ntimes, respectively. \n \n2\n2\/1\n2\/1\nd\nd\nd\nd2\n\u239f\u239f\n\u239f\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n=\nt\nE\nt\nEL\nD\n\u03c0\n    (8) \n \nIn the practical measurements, the 300M steel sample was 2mm thick (ie 2L=2mm) \nwith a charging area of 1.44cm2 and the AerMet100 sample was 1mm thick \n(2L=1mm) with an area of 2.64cm2.  Both were polished to a 1\u00b5m finish with \ndiamond paste and the edges were protected with Lacomit.  In each case, a platinum \ncounter electrode was used and the current density was 1 mAcm-2.  The electrolyte \nwas 0.2M NaOH, with the addition of 1g l-1 of thiourea as a recombination poison to \nensure that hydrogen generated at the surface entered the metal rather than escaping as \nbubbles. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5\nHydrogen embrittlement tests \nThe two high strength steels were machined in the form of tensile specimens, with a \ngauge length of 25 mm and diameter of 2.75 mm.  Some of the tensile specimens \nwere coated with 8 microns of electrodeposited cadmium and others were coated with \nSermeTel 1140\/962 by Sermatech International Inc in Lincoln, UK.  This coating \nconsisted of densely packed aluminium particles in a chromate\/phosphate inorganic \nbinder and was applied as two spray coats, each being cured at 315\u00b0C to give a total \nthickness of 70 microns.  As the process was non-electrolytic it was not expected that \nthese coatings would cause direct embrittlement of the steel substrates. A modified \npolyurethane top-coat was applied to enhance the corrosion resistance and barrier \nproperties of the coating. \n \nThe extent of direct hydrogen embrittlement and re-embrittlement in the coated \nspecimens was assessed by performing slow strain rate (SSR) tests.  Initial tests were \ncarried out in air on uncoated specimens to provide a baseline for comparison.  The \nstrain rate was 9.7 x 10-7 s-1 and four specimens were tested for each experimental \ncondition.  Some of the cadmium plated specimens were tested in the as-plated \ncondition.  (They were stored in liquid nitrogen within 8h of plating to immobilize \nhydrogen in the cadmium and the steel until the test could be carried out).  Other \nplated specimens were tested after being given a de-embrittlement treatment by \nbaking for 24h at 200\u00b0C.  Further tests investigated the effects of corrosion of the \ncadmium coating by surrounding the gauge length of plated and baked specimens \nwith a cell containing 3.5% NaCl solution to simulate service conditions and establish \nrepresentative surface hydrogen concentrations.  In these tests the gauge length was \nscribed to remove the coating and expose the substrate over a width of 1 mm.  Similar \ntests were performed on specimens coated with SermeTel 1140\/962 to measure the re-\nembrittlement caused by corrosion of this aluminium-based coating. \n \nEmbrittlement index  In each case, the time to failure of a coated tensile specimen \n(tc) was recorded and compared with the mean failure time (ta) of uncoated specimens \ntested in air.  The embrittlement index (EI) was calculated as follows;-  \n \nEI  =  1  -  tc\/ta  (9) \n \n \nRESULTS  \n \nHydrogen diffusivities \nA typical transient for 300M from the two-cell permeation technique is shown in \nFigure 1.  The mean breakthrough time for three replicate experiments was 1.9 06.0\u00b1  \nhours and this corresponded to a hydrogen diffusion coefficient of 9.6 3.0\u00b1  x 10-8 \ncm2s-1 from equation (2).  It was evident that AerMet100 had a much lower diffusivity \nas the current transient was very small and the breakthrough time and steady state \ncurrent were difficult to detect (equation (1)).  \n \nThe results of the galvanostatic method for both 300M and AerMet100 are shown in \nFigures 2.  The plot of cell potential difference against time displays a parabolic shape \nfor short charging times, t << L2\/D, followed by a linear region at longer times when t \n>L2\/D.  The corresponding graphs of E vs. t1\/2 and E vs. t are shown in Figures 3 and \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6\n4, respectively and their gradients were used to calculate the hydrogen diffusion \ncoefficients from equation (8).   \n \nThe hydrogen diffusion coefficients for 300M and AerMet100 steels were 8.0x10-8 \nand 1.0x10-9cm2s-1 respectively and the results for the two methods are summarised in \nTable 2. \n \nHydrogen embrittlement testing \nHydrogen embrittlement tests on high strength steel often display a range of times to \nfailure when carried out under apparently identical experimental conditions.  This is \ndue to differences in the number, size and distribution of micro structural flaws within \nthe specimen at which hydrogen accumulates and leads to fracture.  In addition, flaws \nand lack of uniformity in the sacrificial coating will lead to differences in the rate of \nhydrogen uptake by the steel and this too will affect the failure time. In this work, \nWeibull statistics was used to display the probability of each of the four replicate \nspecimens in each group surviving for a specific time before then failing by hydrogen \nembrittlement or re-embrittlement. \n \nWeibull model of failure times  It can be shown that for a Weibull model the \nprobability, Ps, of a specimen not failing within time, t, is given by;- \n \n \nPs  =  1  -  Pf  =  e  -xt                       (10) \n \nWhere Pf  is the probability of failure and x is a shape parameter termed the Weibull \nslope [18-20].  In the present context, x represents the probability per unit time that \nduring time, t, a crack will form in the specimen of sufficient size to cause failure.  \nThe value of x can be obtained from the negative gradient of a graph of ln Ps against t.  \nIn practice, there is a minimum time, ti, for a crack to initiate and the graph is \ndisplaced along the time axis by this amount.  (When Ps = 1, then ln Ps = 0 and t = ti ). \nIn this case, Equation (10) can be modified to include ti . \n \nPs  =  1  -  Pf  =  e \u2013x(t - ti)                              (11) \n \nStudent t-test  In addition to the Weibull model, the Student t-test [21] for small \nsample sizes was used to determine whether a set of failure time data, from the four \nreplicate specimens, was significantly different from other sets of data measured \nunder different experimental conditions, or whether they should be considered to be \npart of the same overall population.  \n \nThe test compared the means of the two data sets, m1 and m2, to calculate the test \nstatistic, t, as follows; \n \n    t   =       (m1 - m2)                                          (12) \n                                                              s\u221a(1\/n1 + 1\/n2) \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 7\nwhere n1 and n2 were the number of failure times in each data set (in this case n1=n2= \n4) and s was found from the standard deviations for the two sets. \n \n \n            s2  =  s12 + s22                                 (13) \n                                                                    2 \n \nThe test statistic was then compared with tabulated values of a t-distribution for a \n95% confidence level with 6 degrees of freedom (n1 + n2 -2).  If the test static was less \nthan the t-distribution then it could be concluded with this confidence level that the \ntwo data sets were part of the same overall population (the null hypothesis). \n \n \nSlow strain rate tests  The slow strain rate test results for 300M and AerMet100 \nspecimens, tested in air and when cadmium coated and exposed to 3.5% NaCl \nsolution, are shown in Figures 5 and 6.  The mean failure times for the four replicate \nspecimens in each condition and the corresponding embrittlement indices are \ncompared in Table 3.  300M displayed much more direct embrittlement than \nAerMet100 and when electroplated with cadmium its embrittlement index, EI, was \n0.54, compared to only 0.05 for AerMet100.  Post-plating baking the cadmium plated \nspecimens at 200\u25cbC was effective in removing hydrogen from the microstructure and \nthe mechanical properties were almost completely recovered to give an EI for 300M \nof 0.04.  Corrosion of the cadmium coating in 3.5% NaCl solution caused significant \nre-embrittlement of 300M and an EI of 0.16.  However, AerMet100 displayed no re-\nembrittlement in 3.5% NaCl solution.  Its lower susceptibility was attributed to the \ndistribution of phases in its microstructure, as discussed in a later section. \n \nThe results for the re-embrittlement tests on the aluminium-based SermeTel 1140\/962 \ncoated specimens are also shown in Figures 5 & 6.  The open circuit potential of \nSermeTel 1140\/962 in 3.5% NaCl solution (-0.76 V (SCE)) was very close to that of \nelectrodeposited cadmium (-0.75 V (SCE)) yet it led to greater re-embrittlement of \n300M, with an EI of 0.27.  The structure of the coating is believed to be an important \nfactor affecting hydrogen uptake, in addition to its electrochemical potential [4].  In \ncontrast, AerMet100 specimens showed no reduction in failure times when tested in \n3.5% NaCl solution.  In fact, there was a small increase in the mean failure time, as \nshown in Table 3, which resulted in a negative value for the calculated embrittlement \nindex.  It is possible that the baking treatment at 315\u00b0C to cure the coating may have \nslightly affected the mechanical properties of the steel.  However, this temperature \nwas well below the tempering temperature of the material (485\u00b0C for 5h) and the \nStudent-t test showed, with a 95% confidence level, that the coated and uncoated \nAerMet100 specimens could not be considered to belong to different statistical \npopulations. \n \nAppearance of the fracture surfaces \nAfter the SSR tests, the fracture surfaces were examined in a scanning electron \nmicroscope.  The different failure modes were carefully mapped across the surfaces \nand are shown schematically for each material in Figures 7 and 8.  The 300M \nspecimens had very little reduction in area due to their high level of embrittlement, \nwhereas the AerMet100 fractures were more ductile and necking had occurred.  In \n300M, a brittle fracture had initiated at a single point at the edge of each specimen and \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 8\npropagated inwards until the stress on the remaining section exceeded the UTS, \nwhereupon it then failed in a ductile manner by microvoid coalescence.  The mean \ndepth of brittle fracture was 1.0mm.  The initial brittle fracture was intergranular, \nsuggesting that the applied stress had been relatively low [22], and this changed to a \ntransgranular cleavage mode as the crack grew in length and the stress increased \n(Figure 9).  In contrast, all the regions of brittle fracture in AerMet100 specimens \nwere transgranular cleavage.  They had initiated from many sites around the \ncircumference but had propagated only a short distance (mean depth of 0.13mm) \nbefore the final ductile failure occurred.     \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nConditions for embrittlement in SSR tests \nFor hydrogen embrittlement failures to occur in SSR tests, two principal conditions \nneed to be met.  The applied stress and the concentration of absorbed hydrogen at the \nspecimen surface must both exceed threshold values for a brittle crack to initiate \n[23,24].  While the stress increased slowly during the SSR test, hydrogen was \ndiffusing into the specimen from the reservoir of hydrogen in the unbaked cadmium \ncoating [25].  Eventually the stress exceeded the threshold value and a brittle crack \ninitiated.  The crack then propagated rapidly towards the centre of the specimen, as \nthe material in this region contained more than the threshold hydrogen concentration.  \nWhen the stress on the remaining cross-section reached the UTS, a ductile overload \nfailure occurred. \n \nClearly, the depth of the brittle region observed on the fracture surface is a measure of \nthe depth to which hydrogen had diffused in that specimen.  Therefore, by \ndetermining this distance it is feasible to model hydrogen diffusion across the section \nand to calculate the corresponding diffusion coefficients [26] which can then be \ncompared with those obtained from the electrochemical measurements.  In practice, \nsome hydrogen would have diffused further than the embrittled region, as the \nconcentration at the crack tip is required to reach the threshold value.  Therefore, the \ndiffusion coefficients assessed from the fracture surfaces should be regarded as \nminimum values.  This model does not preclude any specific crack tip mechanism for \nhydrogen embrittlement [27].  For example, the slip softening mechanism [28] can \nexplain how, in certain circumstances, crack growth can be accompanied by the \nenhanced generation and mobility of dislocations and an observed lowering of the \nstress required for plastic deformation.  However, such crack propagation would still \nrequire absorbed hydrogen to have diffused to sufficient depth below the surface and \nfor a threshold concentration to have been exceeded. \n \nModelling hydrogen uptake by the SSR specimens \nThe case of two-dimensional, radial diffusion in a cylinder has been considered.  The \nrate of hydrogen uptake at the surface, F, is dependent on the hydrogen diffusion \ncoefficient of the steel, D , and the concentration gradient, dC\/dx, according to Fick\u2019s \nfirst law of diffusion [29]. \n \nF = - D dC\/dx                                  (14) \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 9\nBefore the start of the test the residual hydrogen concentration in the specimen, 1C , \nwas assumed to be zero and as soon as hydrogen charging began the surface \nconcentration took on a value, 0C , and remained constant.  These boundary \nconditions, which apply for the case of potentiostatic charging [13] are defined below, \nwhere r is the distance from the centreline of a specimen of radius a. \n \nC = 1C = 0,    0 < r < a,    t = 0         (15) \n \nC = 0C ,    r = a,    t 0\u2265                     (16) \n \nAs the test proceeded, the hydrogen content of the steel increased such that the \nconcentration gradient ( 0C  \u2013 C) was progressively reduced and the rate of hydrogen \nuptake decreased also.  The solution of the diffusion equation for the case of hydrogen \ntransport into a solid cylindrical specimen [29,30], of infinite length, is given in \nequation (17). \n ( ) ( )\n( )\u2211\n\u221e\n=\n\u2212\u2212=\u2212\n\u2212\n1 1\n0\n22\n10\n1 \/\/exp21\nn nn\nnn\nJ\narJaDt\nCC\nCC\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b1\n               (17) \n \nWhere ,......2,1, =nn\u03b1  are roots of ( ) 00 =\u03b1J , the Bessel function of zero order and ( )\u03b11J  is the Bessel function of the first order.  The series is convergent and was \nevaluated for the first 150 Bessel roots.  For the initial condition, 01 =C , the equation \nsimply gives the concentration 0CC .  \n \nMinimum rates of hydrogen uptake \nFigure 10 shows the least depth to which hydrogen could have penetrated into the \ncadmium plated, but unbaked, 300M SSR specimens in the mean failure time of 14.5 \nhours, to explain the observed failures.  The graph represents the hydrogen \nconcentration, C, as a proportion of the surface concentration, Co, across the 2.75mm \ndiameter of the specimen, when charged from both sides.  In evaluating the series in \nequation (17), the hydrogen diffusion coefficient has been adjusted so that hydrogen \njust reached a depth of 1.0mm, which was the mean depth of the embrittled region on \nthe four replicate 300M specimens.  For this condition to be satisfied, the diffusion \ncoefficient would need to be 1 x 10-8 cm2s-1, compared to 8.0 x 10-8 cm2s-1 measured \nusing the galvanostatic method. \n \nSimilar calculations were carried out for AerMet100 such that hydrogen just \npenetrated 0.13mm from the surface; the mean depth of the embrittled region in \ncadmium plated specimens of this alloy, as shown in Figure 11.  In this case, D \nneeded to be 8 x 10-11 cm2s-1, whereas the measured value was 1 x 10-9 cm2s-1.    As \nthe measured diffusion coefficients were the higher values in both steels, it appears \nthat at the time of failure hydrogen had diffused further than the embrittled region, \nindicating that a significant hydrogen concentration was required at the crack tip for \nthe brittle fracture to propagate. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 10\nThreshold hydrogen concentrations \nFigures 12 and 13 show the hydrogen distribution for each alloy that would be \npredicted from its failure time and measured diffusion coefficient.  For 300M (Figure \n12) distributions are shown for a range of times up until failure occurred.  For \nexample, at 10440s hydrogen had just penetrated from each side of the specimen to \nreach the centre (the breakthrough time tb=0.04L2\/D).  At failure (52200s), the \nhydrogen concentration, C\/Co, at a depth of 1.0mm was predicted to be 0.6.  That is to \nsay, the concentration was 0.6 of that at the surface due to hydrogen charging from the \ncadmium coating.  This value represents the threshold hydrogen concentration for \nembrittlement in 300M.   \n \nThe corresponding hydrogen distribution for AerMet100 at the failure time of \n111960s is shown in Figure 13.  At the mean embrittlement depth of 0.13mm, the \nhydrogen concentration is predicted to be 0.4 C\/Co. \n \nComparison of the embrittlement susceptibilities \nThe SSRT results indicate that 300M was the more susceptible of the two alloys to \ndirect hydrogen embrittlement from cadmium plating and re-embrittlement from \nhydrogen generated when the cadmium and aluminium-based sacrificial coatings were \ncorroded.  The hydrogen diffusion coefficient was shown to be approximately 80 \ntimes higher in 300M than in AerMet100 and it appears that the faster rate of \nhydrogen uptake in 300M was a major contributory factor in its greater susceptibility \nin the SSR tests.  Whether AerMet100 would display greater embrittlement if more \ntime was available for hydrogen uptake is an interesting point to consider and this \ncould be investigated by performing tests at a slower strain rate to allow more time for \ndiffusion. \n \nA comparison of the threshold hydrogen concentrations, Cth, required to propagate a \nbrittle crack (Figures 12 and 13) might suggest that AerMet100 was slightly more \nsusceptible than 300M (C\/Co of 0.4 for AerMet100 and 0.6 for 300M).  However, this \ndifference is not thought to be particularly significant.  Both steels have tempered \nmartensite in the microstructure and embrittlement of this phase is expected to be \nsimilar in each case.  In addition, due to the steepness of the hydrogen distribution \nprofile in Figure 13, a small difference in the measured depth of embrittlement in \nAerMet100 would result in a large difference in the predicted C\/Co value.  However, \nthere are features of the microstructure of AerMet100 that explain both its low \nembrittlement susceptibility and the low hydrogen diffusion coefficient. \n \nThe influence of microstructure \nBoth steels consisted of tempered martensite and the marked difference in the two \nhydrogen diffusivities is thought to result from the concentration and distribution of \ntrap sites in their microstructures.  In particular, the presence of retained and reverted \naustenite is an important factor [4].  Figure 14 shows that in 300M retained austenite \nwas present at prior austenite grain boundaries, whereas in AerMet100 the austenite \nwas distributed more widely, on both prior austenite boundaries and martensite lath \nboundaries.  Previous work reported similar microstructures in 300M that had \nreceived equivalent heat treatments to that used in the present study [8,12].  Ritchie et \nal [31] showed that the presence of retained austenite was beneficial in controlling \nhydrogen embrittlement and attributed this to a reduction in the diffusivity of \nhydrogen due to its high solubility in austenite.  In the case of AerMet100, the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 11\naustenite was thought not to have been retained during quenching but to have formed \nby partial reversion of martensite during tempering for 5 hours at 485\u25cbC [32,33].  \nAustenite, is known to have a high hydrogen solubility and low hydrogen diffusivity \n[34] and therefore acts as an effective trap when present in an essentially martensitic \nmicrostructure.  The hydrogen diffusion coefficient of austenitic stainless steel is \nreported [35] to be in the range 1.8-8 x 10-12 cm2s-1 and, although these alloys contain \nchromium and nickel, this indicates the low rate of diffusion that can be expected in \nhigh strength steels when austenite is present.  Similarly, it has been reported that the \napparent diffusivity of duplex stainless steel containing 44% austenite is reduced by \napproximately 400 times in comparison with that of a fully ferritic steel, due to \nhydrogen trapping in the austenite phase [35].  In 300M, austenite retained at prior \naustenite grain boundaries would have trapped some hydrogen but this would have \nprovided limited benefit as the martensite laths within the grains would have remained \nvulnerable to embrittlement.  In AerMet100, however, the presence of a thin (3nm) \nbut essentially continuous envelope of reverted austenite around the martensite laths \nhas been reported [36] and this lowered the risk of embrittlement in the present work \nby acting as a very effective barrier to restrict hydrogen transport and prevent a \ncritical hydrogen concentration being reached in the more susceptible martensite \nphase.  The factors affecting hydrogen uptake and embrittlement have been discussed \nin more detail in a previous paper [4]. \n \nEffect of coating type on hydrogen re-embrittlement \nIt was shown in Table 3 that less re-embrittlement occurred from corrosion of the \ncadmium coating (EI 0.16) than from that of the SermeTel 1140\/962 coating (EI \n0.27), although they had very similar open circuit potentials in 3.5% NaCl solution.  \nGenerally, a more active coating would be expected to cause more hydrogen uptake \nby the steel and a higher level of re-embrittlement.  The influence of coating type on \nhydrogen re-embrittlement has been discussed in detail in a previous paper [4] and the \nstructure of the coating has been shown to have an important effect, in addition to its \nelectrochemical potential.  Etching the coating surfaces in a focused beam of gallium \nions (FIB) and examining the resulting trough in a scanning electron microscope \nrevealed the cadmium to have a dense structure, giving better barrier properties.  In \ncontrast, the SermeTel 1140\/962 coating contained extensive fine pores that are \nthought to have formed during drying of the inorganic binder in the curing treatment.  \nThe pores were mostly closed and, while undesirable, they were less damaging than if \nthey had been through-thickness flaws, which would have left areas of the steel \nsubstrate exposed to act as sites where cathodic hydrogen charging would have \noccurred more readily.  The greater porosity of the SermeTel 1140\/962 resulted in \nmore hydrogen penetrating this coating than passed through the cadmium.  This led to \na higher hydrogen concentration at the SermeTel\/steel interface, with a higher rate of \nhydrogen uptake by the specimen and more re-embrittlement.  In general terms, the \neffect of the coating is to determine the hydrogen concentration at the steel surface \nand the extent of hydrogen uptake and diffusion in the substrate is then the \nconsequence of this concentration. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 12\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n [1]  300M displayed significant direct embrittlement by hydrogen uptake from \nelectrodeposited cadmium coatings and re-embrittlement from the corrosion of both \ncadmium and aluminium-based SermeTel 1140\/962 coatings.  In contrast, AerMet100 \nshowed very little embrittlement in any of these conditions. \n \n[2]  The relative embrittlement susceptibilities of the two steels can be explained by \ntheir different hydrogen diffusivities, which were measured by the galvanic charging \nmethod to be 8.0x10-8 and 1.0x10-9cm2s-1 for 300M and AerMet100, respectively. \n \n[3]  The threshold hydrogen concentrations, Cth, for propagation of brittle cracks in \nthe two steels were estimated to be in the range 0.4-0.6 of the surface concentration \nproduced by unbaked electrodeposited cadmium. \n \n[4]  The greater embrittlement resistance of AerMet100 is attributed to the low rate of \nhydrogen transport in the reverted austenite phase that forms around martensite laths \nin its microstructure during tempering.  The austenite effectively traps absorbed \nhydrogen, preventing it being taken up by the more susceptible martensite phase. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe research described in this paper was supported by Airbus UK.
