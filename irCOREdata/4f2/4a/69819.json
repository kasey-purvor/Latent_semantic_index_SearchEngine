At the time, some felt that such protests could lead to the demise of the courses, and it was\nfar from clear whether Thomas\u2019s reforms would be successful. But, even within this period of uncertainty, the\nDarmstadt Ferienkurse were anything but stagnant.\nIntroduction\nIn 1970 the Darmst\u00e4dter Internationale Ferienkurse f\u00fcr neue Musik took place for the\ntwenty-fifth time. The cultural and institutional landscape of the 1950s, which had led to the\ndevelopment of the misleading notion of the Darmstadt School, was long gone.1 Along with\nit had departed almost every figure associated with that notion, including Pierre Boulez,\nKarel Goeyvaerts, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Henri Pousseur. Of the composers for\nwhom Darmstadt had been key in their rise to prominence, only Karlheinz Stockhausen\nremained as a regular lecturer.2 Since the early 1960s there had been regular criticism of the\ncourses\u2019 content. In 1964 Cornelius Cardew suggested that Darmstadt had \u2018become an\nexcellent Academy, and problems like Notation and Electronic Sound are competently\nhandled in a rather academic way. What has got lost is the vital interest in new and serious\n1 Several Darmstadt-related texts have done much to demonstrate that the idea of the Darmstadt School, especially as\npromulgated in Anglo-American scholarship, is a fundamentally misleading one. Chief among these are Trudu\u2019s La\n\u2018Scuola\u2019 di Darmstadt, Borio\u2019s Musikalische Avantgarde um 1960, and Attinello\u2019s \u2018The Interpretation of Chaos\u2019.\n2 Significantly, Stockhausen only returned to Darmstadt as a regular faculty member in 1966, after Boulez had departed\nfor Bayreuth in 1965.\n255\nexperimental music\u2019.3 By 1966 Wolf-Eberhard von Lewinski was moved to characterize the\ncourses as \u2018a prosaic works convention\u2019.4 Much of this criticism betrayed underlying dis-\nsatisfaction with the direction the Ferienkurse had taken after the death of their founder,\nWolfgang Steinecke, in 1961.5 Ernst Thomas, the former music editor of the Frankfurter\nAllgemeine Zeitung, had been officially appointed director of the Internationales\nMusikinstitut Darmstadt (IMD), and hence also of the Darmstadt Ferienkurse, on 1 October\n1962,6 and it was inevitable that comparisons would be drawn between the two directors.\nWhere Steinecke was already lionized as the visionary founder of Darmstadt, Thomas\u2019s\nquieter, more diffident style quickly led to perceptions of his tenure as that of a caretaker,\npreserving rather than advancing the events of the 1950s.\nIt is in this context that I shall examine some of the institutional problems and personality\nissues that were rife at the Darmstadt Ferienkurse in the early 1970s, and specifically two\nprotests, in 1970 and 1972 respectively, which in their different ways set the future of\nDarmstadt into doubt. What Paul Griffiths calls the previous decade\u2019s \u2018failure of faith\u2019,7\nattributing it somewhat narrowly to an abortive search for a common serial language,8 was by\nnow turning into a wider crisis of belief, which questioned whether the courses could have\nany real validity. I shall show, however, that a great deal of this \u2018failure of faith\u2019 had its origins\nin the internal political wranglings of individuals active in the institutions of New Music in\nWest Germany, with much of the discontent emanating from one source in particular,\nnamely the journalist and music editor Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel.\nAlongside this runs a second strand of inquiry, which reveals that many of the reforms\nnormally associated with the revival of the Ferienkurse under the more colourful Friedrich\nHommel, who succeeded Thomas in 1982, had earlier beginnings under Thomas\u2019s director-\nship. Moreover, many of these reforms were initiated not by Thomas himself, but by his\nnewly created Programmbeirat, or advisory panel. The progressive devolution of power from\nwhat began as Thomas\u2019s \u2018one-man-show\u2019 was the real sign that Darmstadt could start to\nrecover on an institutional level.9 However, by then the general perception of the\nFerienkurse, so heavily damaged by the infighting I shall outline, made it impossible for this\nmajor institutional reform to become apparent until Hommel\u2019s accession. Like Steinecke,\nHommel had a media-friendly image that was in sharp contrast to the widespread perception\n3 Cardew, \u2018New Music Has Found its Feet\u2019.\n4 Lewinski, \u2018Alte und neue Experimente bei Kranichsteinern\u2019; quoted in Kurtz, Stockhausen, 147. Lewinski, it should be\nnoted, is one of the most critical of commentators on Ernst Thomas\u2019s Darmstadt. From 1951 he was active as a\njournalist in Darmstadt, and many had anticipated that it would be he, rather than Thomas, who would take over\nDarmstadt as its second director.\n5 Steinecke was killed in a hit-and-run incident on 23 December 1961.\n6 He had already acted as curator for the 1962 courses, the bulk of which Steinecke had planned before his death.\n7 Griffiths, Thames and Hudson Encyclopaedia of 20th-Century Music, 58.\n8 Whether any such search for a common language ever occurred, except in the most primitive of terms, is itself highly\nquestionable. The rapidity with which many composers abandoned any sort of \u2018strict\u2019 approach to multiple serialism,\nand the degree to which personal variations were integrated into individual serial techniques, largely developing into\nentirely personalized systems with only the most tenuous links to models such as Boulez\u2019s Structure Ia, suggest that, if\na common language had been a goal for some, most had abandoned this goal well before Nono\u2019s formulation of the\n\u2018Darmstadt School\u2019 in 1957 or Cage\u2019s arrival at Darmstadt in 1958, probably between 1954 and 1955.\n9 Klaus Trapp refers to Thomas\u2019s direction as an \u2018Ein-Mann-Betrieb\u2019 (\u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 370).\n256 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nof Thomas as \u2018an administrator rather than a musician who simply wanted everything to run\nsmoothly\u2019.10 While there is certainly truth in such estimations of Thomas, a simplistic\ncharacterization of this kind tends to negate the positive aspects of his reign. Even though\nThomas almost invariably had to be pressurized into making changes, the restructuring of\nDarmstadt that he undertook was an extremely astute one. Moreover, it was precisely these\ninstitutional changes upon which Hommel was later to capitalize.11 In short, if Thomas was\nan administrator rather than a musician, he was a fine administrator, who responded to\nproblems on both institutional and structural levels with imagination and resolve. He was, as\nSellar and Yeatman might have put it,12 a good man but a bad king.\n1970. Student Protest. The Darmstadt Delegation\nThe year 1970 was the twenty-fifth occasion of the Darmstadt Ferienkurse.13 Although Ernst\nThomas had not planned any particular celebratory events, the town of Darmstadt itself, still\nthe courses\u2019 principal benefactor, provided the money for a composition competition. Since\n1952 there had been a performers\u2019 prize, the Kranichsteiner Musikpreis, which had been\nawarded (normally to several recipients) every year until 1962, and since then only in 1967\nand 1969. This, however, was the first time in the courses\u2019 history that a prize for composition\nwas to be awarded. The competition was divided into two sections, each with a first and a\nsecond prize. The first section, with awards of 8000 and 4000 marks, was for an orchestral\npiece, with the optional inclusion of soloists, choir, or tape. The second was for a chamber\nwork (scored for up to six players), a work for unaccompanied choir (up to sixteen voices),\nor an electronic work. The awards for this section were of 6000 and 3000 marks, raising the\ntotal available prize money to the substantial sum of 20,000 marks. The jury had five\nmembers, each of them established regulars at Darmstadt: G\u00fcnther Becker, Heinz Enke,\nAloys Kontarsky, Bruno Maderna, and Otto Tomek. Only Maderna and Becker were recog-\nnized composers; Enke and Tomek were both primarily broadcast journalists.14 Kontarsky,\nof course, was a well-known Darmstadt figure, both as a member of the teaching faculty and\nas the pianist in the Stockhausen Ensemble.\nIn the event, the competition attracted 102 scores from seventy-six composers hailing\nfrom twenty-five different countries. Despite this exceptionally high level of interest, after\nfourteen days of \u2018vague rumours about the awarding or non-awarding\u2019 of the prizes during\nthe Ferienkurse, only one score was selected to receive a prize, and even then only a second\n10 Attinello, \u2018The Interpretation of Chaos\u2019, 6.\n11 Although I do not dwell on this point here, it is worth adding that Thomas\u2019s reorganization of the composition\nfaculty after Stockhausen\u2019s departure following the 1974 courses was also an important factor in Hommel\u2019s success.\nMost of the composers who came to be regarded as leaders in the European New Music scene in the 1980s, and were\nlater intimately linked to Hommel\u2019s Darmstadt, were first invited to the Ferienkurse by Thomas. Foremost among\nthese were Brian Ferneyhough, G\u00e9rard Grisey, Helmut Lachenmann, and Wolfgang Rihm.\n12 Authors of 1066 and All That (1930).\n13 The actual twenty-fifth anniversary of the Ferienkurse, founded in 1946, fell a year later in 1971. Ironically, that year\nwould be the first since Darmstadt\u2019s foundation in which no courses took place.\n14 Enke and Tomek represented the Hessischer Rundfunk (HR) and the S\u00fcdwestfunk (SWF) respectively. Thomas was\nlater criticized for the level of influence he had allowed Tomek to have on his thinking.\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 257\nprize.15 The piece in question was Nicolaus A. Huber\u2019s Versuch \u00fcber Sprache for sixteen solo\nvoices, hammond organ, double bass, and two \u2018obbligato\u2019 loudspeaker channels.16 Wolfgang\nBecker reported the reasons behind the jury\u2019s selection:\nThe extent of the non-musically predetermined interpolations was so consider-\nable that it was impossible to gain a precise idea of the sonic form of the works. As\na consequence, only two scores were admitted to the final judging, and it was\ndecided only after the performance to confer a second prize, as it was impossible\nto award the first prize.17\nDespite this explanation, the implicit message from the jury was that the standard of\nsubmissions was insufficiently high. Indeed, Stockhausen was quoted as stating categorically:\n\u2018There is nobody talented any more.\u201918 Lewinski strengthened this view by defending the\ncourage of the jury\u2019s decision. In his opinion, to have awarded all four available prizes would\nhave meant an unacceptable lowering of standards.19 Worse still for the competition organ-\nizers, Huber\u2019s piece was itself heavily booed at its first performance.20 It is worth wondering\nwhether this display of dissatisfaction represented a reaction to the piece itself, or a protest by\nthe many refused composers represented in the audience. Such disquiet cannot have been\nhelped by Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s report, which suggested that Huber would have been\nawarded the first prize had he not used a text from Karl Marx among the various fragments\nin Versuch \u00fcber Sprache.21 Ernst Thomas refuted this claim, observing that the score did not\nprovide the sources of the material, and that the jury could therefore not have known the\nprovenance of the text.22\nThe problems over the 1970 composition competition came after many years of under-\nlying discontent among the participants. It is perhaps worth mentioning three of the most\n15 \u2018Nach den 14 Tagen mag es der Darmst\u00e4dter Jury leichterfallen, nach dem dunklen Gemunkel \u00fcber die Verleihung\nbeziehungsweise Nichtverleihung der ausgeschriebenen Kompositionspreise zu beteuern, es sei wirklich nicht mehr\nPreisw\u00fcrdiges eingesandt worden\u2019 (Bach, \u2018Laute Mi\u00dft\u00f6ne bei den Darmst\u00e4dter Kursen\u2019).\n16 \u2018In Darmstadt blast ein frischer Wind\u2019, Basler Nachrichten, 16 September 1970.\n17 \u2018La parte degli interventi non musicalmente prestabiliti era cos\u00ec grande che era impossibile farsi un\u2019idea precisa della\nforma sonora delle opere.

The other score admitted to the final judging was by Hans\nDarmstadt. As Darmstadt was a pupil of one of the judges, G\u00fcnther Becker, it may have been deemed inappropriate\nto award a prize to him.\n18 \u2018Keine Talente mehr\u2019 (\u2018Kritik an den Etablierten\u2019, Hessische Allgemeine, 10 September 1970).\n19 Lewinski, \u2018Auch ein nacktes M\u00e4dchen kann die Moderne nicht retten\u2019.\n20 \u2018Gef\u00e4hrdetes Forum der Avantgarde\u2019, Weser-Kurier, 8 September 1970.

This suggestion was strongly denied by Ernst Thomas, who stated that\nOehlschl\u00e4gel had misunderstood a comment made by the mayor, Ludwig Engel, at the official ceremony of the 1970\ncourse. Thomas would find cause to use these words against Oehlschl\u00e4gel only two years later, during the controversy\nof 1972.\n22 \u2018Sie gipfelte in der Verd\u00e4chtigung, die Jury habe Huber nur eine zweite Preis zuerkannt, da seinen Komposition einen\nMarx-Text enthalte, was bis dahin allerdings niemand bemerkt hatte, denn diese Quellenangabe fehlte in der der Jury\nvorliegenden Partitur\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Von der Notwendigkeit\u2019, 9). The published version of the score gives a compre-\nhensive list of the texts used, but even with the Marx citation thus identified, it is extremely difficult to identify exactly\nwhere in the score these interpolations occur, given the degree to which the text has been fragmented.\n258 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nprominent points of contention, although criticism of Darmstadt in the 1960s was hardly\nlimited to these issues alone. First, the charge of academicism, levelled by Lewinski and\nCardew in the remarks quoted at the start of this essay, was common: it had arisen particu-\nlarly in the context of what were perceived as rather dry conferences on notation, form, and\nmusic theatre in 1964, 1965, and 1966 respectively. Second, Thomas\u2019s dismissal of Cage as a\ncharlatan, and the effective bar on his participation that arose from this, was guaranteed to\ninflame tempers among the many West German Cage partisans. Third, in the wake of\nSteinecke\u2019s death, some perceived a struggle for supremacy to have broken out between\nBoulez and Stockhausen (most particularly, although Nono too was said to be involved to a\nlesser extent) for supremacy at Darmstadt.23 Despite this, many of the arguments that\nrevolved around these points were, compared to what followed at the beginning of the 1970s,\nrelatively quiet, or at least were carried on in private.\nThis underlying sense of unease, then, finally reached its zenith towards the end of the\n1970 courses. The participants held two open meetings in the Justus-Liebig-Haus on 1 and 3\nSeptember to discuss the problems facing the Ferienkurse and to put forward proposals to\nErnst Thomas for their solution. Thomas himself declined to attend the meetings.24 One of\nthe more politically active regular Darmstadt participants, Hans G. Helms, opened the\ndebate, acting as chairman throughout. Following him, Stockhausen spoke, giving a pr\u00e9cis of\nthe history of the courses. Later, in his public response to the meeting\u2019s criticism in the 1972\nedition of the Darmst\u00e4dter Beitr\u00e4ge zur Neuen Musik, Ernst Thomas was to quote from\nStockhausen\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \u2018Please, have no illusions that things might have been better earlier:\nthat is simply a utopia! It may look like that, but it was always mediocrity and the average that\nrepresented the present, with a few \u2018\u2018peak\u2019\u2019 performances coming out of it from time to\ntime.\u201925 However, Thomas may actually have been exacerbating the problem by using\nStockhausen\u2019s words to defend himself. As Trapp points out, Stockhausen\u2019s speech at the\nfirst of the open meetings demonstrated, if any demonstration were necessary, that he\nremained the dominant figure at Darmstadt. This was to be precisely the first major criticism\nof many of the participants at that meeting: they wanted a broader fare of music to be\nrepresented.26\nThe second main criticism was directly related to the first. John Deathridge recalled that,\nalthough there was anxiety regarding Stockhausen\u2019s key role in the courses, it was also\nrecognized that he was the only member of the lecturing staff who was really \u2018delivering\u2019.27\nLigeti, for instance, was charged with having given virtually the same lecture several times\nunder different titles.28 If the standard of participants in the 1970 composition competition\n23 Attinello, for instance, supports this view; \u2018The Interpretation of Chaos\u2019, 6.\n24 \u2018Niederrheinsicher Bauernbuddhismus\u2019, Abendzeitung, 9 September 1970.\n25 \u2018Bitte, machen Sie sich keine Illusionen, es sei fr\u00fcher besser gewesen, das ist alles Utopie! Das sieht so aus, aber es ist\nimmer so gewesen, da\u00df die Mediokrit\u00e4t und der Durchschnitt die Gegenwart repr\u00e4sentiert haben, und einige\nSpitzenleistungen ab und zu daraus hervorgangen sind\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Von der Notwendigkeit\u2019, 7).\n26 \u2018Hier wurde bereits deutlich, da\u00df Stockhausen die beherrschende Figur jener Jahre war und genau hier die Kritik\nmanche Teilnehmer ansetzte: man wollte ein breites Spektrum kompositorischer Richtungen erleben\u2019 (Trapp,\n\u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 370).\n27 Interview with the author, 3 December 2001.\n28 See, for instance, Rudolf Frisius\u2019s polemical article \u2018Wer hat die Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse ruiniert?\u2019.\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 259\nhad been found wanting in the eyes of the lecturing faculty, so too the quality of the lecturing\nfaculty fell somewhat short of the expectations of the participants.\nIt is not difficult to understand why there would be dissatisfaction both with Stockhausen\u2019s\ndominance, and with the lack of input from others. To grasp the reasons for Stockhausen\u2019s\npre-eminence, it is necessary to look back over the history of his participation (and tempor-\nary non-participation) during the previous decade. Stockhausen had neither taught at nor\nattended Darmstadt in 1964 and 1965. For many years before this he had been discussing the\nidea of establishing a permanent music university in Cologne, based upon the Darmstadt\nmodel. Only when Hugo Wolfram Schmidt took over direction of the Rheinische\nMusikschule in 1962 did such plans begin to yield concrete results. Stockhausen\u2019s Cologne\nNew Music Courses were given a three-month trial from 1 October 1963, with Pousseur\nteaching composition alongside Stockhausen and with Aloys Kontarsky, Frederic Rzewski,\nand Christoph Caskel on hand as instrumentalists. Thomas was evidently worried, perhaps\nunderstandably, by the competition that might ensue between Cologne and Darmstadt,\nparticularly given that many of Stockhausen\u2019s teaching staff had already taught, or continued\nto teach, at Darmstadt. Thomas therefore felt compelled to ask Stockhausen to choose\nbetween Darmstadt and Cologne. Unsurprisingly, Stockhausen chose his own courses.29\nWhile Thomas still had Boulez as a faculty member, Stockhausen\u2019s absence was palpable\nbut not disastrous. When Boulez decided he would not return in 1966, however, it was\nevident that Ligeti\u2019s courses would not be sufficient to sustain the Ferienkurse, even with\nKagel offering additional seminars focusing on music theatre. Thomas had little choice but to\nreinvite Stockhausen. It was this second period of his attendance that represented the acme of\nStockhausen\u2019s influence on the artistic direction of Darmstadt.\nThe years 1967 and 1968 had been largely dominated by Stockhausen\u2019s two composition\ncourses Ensemble and Musik f\u00fcr ein Haus, and 1969 by courses focusing on Aus den sieben\nTagen. In 1970, although Ligeti had been allocated more course time than Stockhausen, it\nwas again Stockhausen\u2019s six mammoth lectures that were the primary focus for many.30\nAlongside this, Thomas\u2019s composition faculty had seemed distinctly lacklustre since\nStockhausen\u2019s return: Ligeti and G\u00fcnther Becker were the main contributors, with other\nfigures, such as Lukas Foss, Kagel, and Lutos\u0142awski, participating only in subsidiary roles.\nLigeti, Becker, and Kagel were, of course, familiar Darmstadt faces. Foss and Lutos\u0142awski\nwere doubtless the more \u2018exotic\u2019 options, and so, in a situation in which the sameness of\ncontributions was becoming problematic, their relegation to secondary status within the\ncomposition faculty was especially unfortunate. It was therefore unsurprising that the open\nmeetings of 1970 chose to foreground these two related problems: that, while Stockhausen\u2019s\n29 For a fuller description of these events see Kurtz, Stockhausen, 125\u20139.\n30 The lectures were held between 27 August and 2 September under the titles \u2018Micro- and Macro-continuum\u2019,\n\u2018Metacollage and Integration\u2019, \u2018Expansion of the Tempo Scale\u2019, \u2018Feedback\u2019, \u2018Spectral Harmonics\u2019, \u2018Expansion of\nDynamics\u2019, and \u2018Spatial Music\u2019 (\u2018Spectral Harmonics\u2019 and \u2018Expansion of Dynamics\u2019 were separate parts of the same\nlecture). From \u2018Feedback\u2019 onwards these lectures began at eight in the evening and continued late into the night, well\npast midnight in many cases. A brief pr\u00e9cis of the contents of these lectures is given in Stockhausen,Texte, vol. 3:Texte\nzur Musik 1963\u201370, 222\u201330.\n260 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nseminars were unquestionably the highlight of the courses, there really was little else to come\nto Darmstadt for.\nThe third issue raised in the open meetings likewise centred on concerns over the\nconcentration of power; but this time the focus was on the director, who, it was argued,\nretained too much individual control over the courses. The participants felt that they\nthemselves should have some say in the course content. The wordMitbestimmung \u2013 meaning\n\u2018co-determination\u2019, ordinarily in the sense of workers in a factory taking an active part in\ndecisions regarding production \u2013 featured prominently in these discussions.\nIt would be tempting to regard the development of ideas of co-determination as related to\nleft-wing political modes of thinking, bound up with the widespread student protests across\nEurope in the aftermath of the 1968 \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Certainly this is true, but in the West\nGerman context a more specifically relevant and topical exemplar of this post-1968 mindset\nis to be found in the contemporary industrial campaigns of West German journalists. The\nright to co-determination had been established for most industries as early as 1952 in the\n\u2018works constitution law\u2019 (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz), but the law did not fully cover organiza-\ntions active in areas that might be considered political, moral, or philosophical. Thus\njournalists working for the West German publishing houses did not have Mitbestimmung\nrights. By the late 1960s, though, one of the key aims of the Deutscher Journalisten-Verband\n(German Press Organization) had become the extension of such rights to its members.\nSpecifically, and most pertinently in this context, the DJV sought clarity with regard to the\ndivision of competence between publishers and editors, which is to say the demarcation\nof areas of authority and responsibility.31 The importance of this relationship between\njournalists and the Darmstadt administration will become clearer below.\nIt was in this context, then, that concrete proposals were put forward for what the\nparticipants wished to see in future. Friedrich Hommel, Thomas\u2019s successor as music editor\nof the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and later his successor as director of the Ferienkurse,\nsummarized the key requests:\n1 A greater emphasis on the composition seminars and the establishment of a composers\u2019\nforum.\n2 A strengthening of the genuinely international courses and concerts on offer, with\nincreased involvement of the course participants.\n3 A greater consideration of non-European music cultures.\n4 Group teaching for practical improvisation and performance, in cooperation with the\ncomposers\u2019 forum.\n5 Improvement of the facilities for electronic and computer music.\n6 Greater consideration of \u2018fringe areas\u2019 (Grenzgebieten), such as film, music theatre,\nhappenings, radio plays, pop music, and parapsychology.\n7 The incorporation of aspects of research, through experts from the areas of sociology,\ncritical theory, aural psychology and physiology, as well as information theory.\n31 For further details see Humphreys, Media and Media Policy, 105\u20136.\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 261\n8 Better use of the available possibilities for democratization.\n9 Suggestions for the redistribution of the budget, without which many of the proposals\nwould be impossible.32\nHommel failed to point out two further issues raised by the meeting, both of which Klaus\nTrapp mentions. First, that either simultaneous translation of lectures should be offered in\nlanguages other than German, French, and English, or that translated texts of the lectures\nshould be available. Second \u2013 an issue that may have seemed frivolous to Hommel but was of\nunquestionable importance to the participants \u2013 it was requested that the quality of the food\nbe improved.33\nIn order that these proposals could be put forward to Ernst Thomas directly, the meeting\nelected five people as the so-called \u2018Darmstadt Delegation\u2019: the composers Tim Souster and\nNicolaus A. Huber, the artist Mary Bauermeister-Stockhausen, the percussionist Christoph\nCaskel, and the journalist Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel. A further five were elected to act as\ndeputies: the musicologist and journalist Rudolf Frisius, the composers Peter Michael Hamel\nand Junsang Bahk, the radio editor and composer Ernstalbrecht Stiebler, and the student\nMax E. Keller.34 One commentator raises the point that, since Stockhausen himself was one\nof the courses\u2019 strongest defenders, it is curious that his wife, Mary Bauermeister-\nStockhausen, was elected as a member of the delegation.35 It is worth mentioning too that,\ndespite the strongly expressed desire to hear more music from outside Europe, and most\nimportantly from outside Germany, of the delegation only two were non-German: Souster,\nfrom Britain, and Bahk, from Korea. The structure of the delegation, specifically its division\ninto panels of five, is particularly noteworthy. Given that one of the underlying principles of\nthe delegation\u2019s demands was the notion of Mitbestimmung \u2013 the currency of which was, as\nmentioned above, mainly of journalistic origin in late 1960s West Germany \u2013 the model is\nsurely most reminiscent of the structure of the Deutscher Presserat (German Press Council),\nwhich at its foundation in 1956 consisted of five representatives of newspaper publishers, five\nnewspaper journalists, and, after 1957, five representatives from the magazine sector.36 The\nnumber of journalists acting as delegation members \u2013 three (Oehlschl\u00e4gel, Stiebler, and\nFrisius) \u2013 also seems disproportionately high, given that nearly all of the ordinary course\nparticipants were either composers or performers.\nA few days after the second meeting of the participants, Ernst Thomas published his initial\nreply to the criticism in the Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt.37 He begins by questioning the validity of\n32 Hommel, \u2018Neue T\u00f6ne gesucht\u2019, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 9 September 1970.\n33 These additional points are mentioned by Trapp in \u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 370. That the problem with\nfood continues to the present day is attested by Pierre-Yves Artaud (\u2018I have a piece . . .!\u2019) and by the present author,\nwho experienced Darmstadt catering in 2002, 2004, and 2006.\n34 See Trapp, \u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 370.\n35 \u2018Niederrheinischer Bauernbuddhismus\u2019, Abendzeitung, 9 September 1970. Since Stockhausen and Bauermeister\nwere basically estranged by this point (indeed in 1972 Bauermeister gave birth to a child by David Johnson, sometime\nmember of the Stockhausen Ensemble), her presence on the delegation is unlikely to have been anything to do with\nStockhausen\u2019s influence. It is perhaps more noteworthy that Bahk and Souster were pupils of Stockhausen.\n36 Humphreys, Media and Media Policy, 59.\n37 \u2018Experten bestimmen die Ferienkurse\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 8 September 1970.\n262 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nthe delegation, observing that it was elected by less than half the total body of participants:\nthis, he writes, \u2018raises the question of how far [their suggestions] can truly be considered\nrepresentative of general opinion\u2019.38 He goes on to suggest that, far from being new, many of\nthe suggestions being put forward had already been partially realized in earlier years, or had\nbeen discounted on financial grounds. While Thomas declares himself happy to receive\nsuggestions of particular composers or performers as potential lecturers at Darmstadt,\nthe maintenance of standards he considers to be his own ultimate responsibility.\nPreserving continuity from year to year is both necessary and desirable for the develop-\nment of the courses. As mainstays ensuring this continuity Thomas specifically names\nStockhausen and Ligeti as composers, and the violinist Saschko Gawriloff, the cellist Siegfried\nPalm, and Aloys Kontarsky as performers. He also observes that \u2018a broad spectrum of\ninformation can be beneficial, but it can also turn into a fatal pluralism, which causes\nconfusion rather than being instructive\u2019.39 Thomas thus directly states his intention to follow\na specific trajectory, hoping for forward development through the continuity of lecturers,\nrather than by presenting the participants with the wide selection of trends requested by the\ndelegation.\nIn his broadcast on the 1970 courses for Radio Z\u00fcrich, Lewinski suggested that Thomas\nshould now experiment with the structure of the courses, arguing that such an experiment\nwould be better than having \u2018fatigue\u2019 become the primary reason for the courses\u2019 ultimate\ndecay.40 With uncharacteristic optimism, Lewinski goes so far as to suggest the chance of a\nnew beginning, but he is clearly not confident, even assuming that Thomas was willing to\ntake the necessary risks, that it would be enough to secure the successful continuation of the\nFerienkurse.41\n1971. A Well-Deserved Break? The Advisory Panel. New Structures\n\u2018After 25 years in which the Darmstadt Ferienkurse have played a decisive part in the\ndevelopment of New Music, we believe a break is justifiable.\u201942 So began \u2018Information I\u2019, a\nshort press release published by the IMD in January 1971. This missive must have come as a\ngreat surprise to many of those intending to participate at Darmstadt in 1971, not least the\nmembers of the Darmstadt Delegation. The delegation, which had met as recently as October\n1970 in Donaueschingen and had issued a press release of its own, must have felt somewhat\n38 \u2018Es erhebt sich nat\u00fcrlich die Frage, inwieweit es tats\u00e4chlich repr\u00e4sentativ f\u00fcr die Meinungsbildung sein kann\u2019\n(\u2018Experten bestimmen die Ferienkurse\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt).\n39 \u2018Breite Information kann gut sein, aber sie kann auch in einem fatalen Pluralismus ausarten, der mehr Verwirrung\nstiftet als Unterrichtung bietet\u2019 (\u2018Experten bestimmen die Ferienkurse\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt).\n40 \u2018Dennoch sollte Thomas versuchen, mit den Ferienkursen selbst zu experimentieren, neue Formen zu entwickeln[.]\nEs ist immer noch besser, wenn die darmst\u00e4dter [sic] Ferienkurse an einem solchen Experiment zugrunde gehen als\nwenn sie durch Ermattung sterben\u2019 (IMD transcript of Kranichstein 1970, Radio Z\u00fcrich, 6 November 1970).\n41 \u2018Die Chance zu einem Neubeginn ist vorhanden\u2019 (Kranichstein 1970, Radio Z\u00fcrich).\n42 \u2018Nach 25 Jahren, in denen die Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Entwicklung der Neuen\nMusik geleistet haben, glauben wir, eine Pause verantworten zu k\u00f6nnen\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Information I\u2019, IMD, January\n1971).\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 263\nfrustrated by the delay this would cause to their reforms.43 Nonetheless, \u2018Information 1\u2019\npresented a number of the IMD\u2019s own reforms. Two further press releases followed:\n\u2018Information 2\u2019 in June 1971, and \u2018Information 3\u2019 in September 1971. Taken together, these\ndocuments seem to suggest a decisive rethink on the part of the courses\u2019 director.\nHowever, these decisions, for once, had not been made by the director alone. Rather than\ntaking the advice of the Darmstadt Delegation, Ernst Thomas had set up his own body, the\nso-called Programmbeirat, or advisory panel. The institution of this panel was approved by\nthe city of Darmstadt\u2019s director of education and culture, Heinz-Winfried Sabais, who was\nalso at that time acting mayor.44 The members of the advisory panel were Aloys Kontarsky,\nSiegfried Palm, and Christoph Caskel. Kontarsky and Palm were, of course, two of the three\nmainstay performers mentioned by Ernst Thomas in his response to the delegation, whereas\nCaskel was a member of the delegation itself.\nThe most significant piece of information given by the IMD\u2019s first press release in January\n1971 is that the Ferienkurse would henceforth run biennially, starting in 1972 and continuing\nin the even-numbered years. However, the decision to switch to a biennial pattern had clearly\nnot been made by Thomas\u2019s new advisory panel, since its first meeting did not take place until\nMay 1971.45 Neither, in fact, had it been taken by Thomas, but on the civic authority of\nSabais, for reasons that will be explained in more detail below. In compensation for the loss\nof every other year, the length of the courses was to be extended from two weeks to three. The\nfirst press release also promised a new \u2018working studio\u2019 (Arbeitsstudio), which would aim to\nprovide a more collaborative environment for young composers.46 After the first meeting of\nthe advisory panel, this studio was given a more concrete form, with the details provided in\n\u2018Information 2\u2019. This press release contains a \u2018call for pieces\u2019, requesting that scores, tapes,\nand suggestions for collective work be sent to the IMD by 1 March 1972. It also promises that\nthe studios will give the participants the opportunity to talk about their own pieces, analyse\nnew compositions, discuss compositional problems, but \u2018above all to be active as compos-\ners\u2019.47 Although such studios had occasionally taken place at Darmstadt \u2013 most notably those\nled by Nono and Maderna in 1958, Stockhausen\u2019s seminars in 1961, and his two pre-courses\nEnsemble and Musik f\u00fcr ein Haus \u2013 the idea that young composers came to Darmstadt to\npresent their work was one that had never really been formalized. Thus, in many ways, what\nThomas and his advisory panel seemed to be proposing was quite radical for Darmstadt. The\nemphasis was being taken away from the established composers, who had tended to lecture\n43 \u2018F\u00fcr Mitbestimmung bei Ferienkursen\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Echo, 21 October 1970.\n44 Caskel, \u2018Die Arbeit des Programmbeirats\u2019, 411. That Sabais took so great an interest in the changes to the Ferienkurse\nsuggests that the city was also becoming anxious for the proper management of its investment. As the Ferienkurse\nwere one of the city\u2019s great \u2018success stories\u2019, it is little surprise that the civic authorities would take an interest in\nensuring their successful continuance.\n45 Caskel, \u2018Die Arbeit des Programmbeirats\u2019, 411.\n46 \u2018Die wird auch erm\u00f6glichen, ein bereits f\u00fcr 1970 projektiertes Arbeitsstudio junger Komponisten nun in gr\u00f6\u00dferem\nUmfang stattfinden zu lassen: zur Mitarbeit in diesem Studio rufen wir bereits jetzt die jungen Komponisten auf \u2019\n(Thomas, \u2018Information 1\u2019).\n47 \u2018Den Teilnehmer soll die M\u00f6glichkeit geboten werden, \u00fcber eigene Kompositionen zu referieren, neue Kompositio-\nnen zu analysieren, Probleme heutigen Komponierens zu er\u00f6rtern, vor allem aber kompositorisch t\u00e4tig zu sein\u2019\n(Thomas, \u2018Information 2\u2019).\n264 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\non their own work, and transferred to the new work being brought by the participants. This\nchange of focus was confirmed by Thomas\u2019s stated intention that the results of the studio\nwork should, as far as possible, be realized and discussed within the boundaries of the\ncourses, and that the young performers should be working on the scores of the young\ncomposers.48 The third press release, from September 1971, makes this proposal still clearer,\nsuggesting that where possible one of the lecturers would be working with the participants.\nMost important, however, is the statement that this work would then be publicly presented\nin studio concerts, for which \u2018programme suggestions [. . .] are requested from the partici-\npants\u2019.49 Again, until this point, the idea that a young composer might bring a piece to\nDarmstadt and have it played at the end of the courses would have been a fanciful one.\nDespite the flexibility of the Internationales Kammerensemble Darmstadt (IKD), under the\ndirection of Maderna, the programming of concerts was largely set in stone by the time the\ncourses actually took place. In seeming disregard of Thomas\u2019s earlier warnings concerning\nthe dangers of a \u2018fatal pluralism\u2019, \u2018Information 3\u2019 expresses the hope that with these new\nprovisions \u2018a broad spectrum of New Music can be considered\u2019.50 Christoph Caskel reports\nthat the members of the advisory panel themselves were somewhat sceptical of this new\ndevelopment: the real impetus for change came from Ernst Thomas himself. Caskel states\nthat Thomas wanted more dialogue between the participants and the lecturers, and was\nclearly keen to break down the perceived divisions.51 Thomas was also surely aware that, with\nthis shift in emphasis, he was taking a large risk: it was necessary that the standards of both\nyoung performers and composers remain high for Darmstadt to continue. Yet, in answer to\nhis critics, he was also demonstrating clearly that responsibility for programming was now\nshared between the IMD executive and the participants.\nThe second press release also explains the detailed new technical provisions for the\nelectronic studio, which appears by now to have been furnished with some of the most\nup-to-date equipment. Even so, participants were asked to bring certain items with them,\nsuch as synthesizers, ring modulators, and contact microphones. Presumably, despite the\nrebuilt studio, the IMD remained unable to provide sufficient equipment for all the partici-\npants. The considerable improvement in the technical facilities met one key demand of the\nDarmstadt delegation, and the provision of a number of new projectors met another, by\nenabling investigations into the \u2018fringe area\u2019 of film.\nThe new stress on composition within the boundaries of the courses is emphasized by one\nof the most surprising changes announced by \u2018Information 3\u2019. Despite the fiasco of the 1970\ncomposition competition, the Kranichsteiner Musikpreis was to be revived, with two awards\nmade at the conclusion of the Ferienkurse, one for the best performance by a student and one\n48 \u2018Arbeitsergebnisse sollen soweit wie m\u00f6glich noch innerhalb der Kurse realisiert und diskutiert werden, wobei eine\nZusammenarbeit mit jungen Interpreten unter den Teilnehmern angestrebt wird\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Information 2\u2019).\n49 \u2018Vorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr das Studioprogramm von Seiten der Teilnehmer sind erw\u00fcnscht\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Information 3\u2019).\n50 \u2018damit ein breites Spektrum Neuer Musik ber\u00fccksichtigt werden kann\u2019 (Thomas, \u2018Information 3\u2019).\n51 \u2018Wie so etwas aussehen k\u00f6nnte, blieb zu Anfang vage und unumschrieben \u2013 klar wie nur, da\u00df derartige\nKompositionsstudios sich in Richtung auf eine \u2018\u2018dialogischere\u2019\u2019 Vermittlung (so Wolfgang Rihm in einem sp\u00e4teren\nKommentar) entwickeln sollten\u2019 (Caskel, \u2018Die Arbeit des Programmbeirats\u2019, 412).\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 265\nfor the best new composition presented within the studio concerts. The sum available for the\nfirst of this new round of Kranichstein awards was 4000 marks.52\nNot mentioned in the IMD press releases, however, is one of the most significant changes.\nMany of the regular participants at Darmstadt had for several years bemoaned the fact that\nthe courses no longer took place in a single location, which had been the Marienh\u00f6he, a\nprivate school, until 1965. Between 1966 and 1970 the primary location for lectures had been\nthe Justus-Liebig-Haus in the centre of the city. However, many other events had had to be\nscattered across Darmstadt, diminishing the sense of a unified programme and depriving the\nparticipants of opportunities to communicate and intermingle. Social interaction was fur-\nther inhibited by the fact that the participants were housed in various different sites across the\ncity. While the housing situation could not be solved immediately, the advisory panel felt that\na new central location for the courses was vital. The ideal choice would be another school\nbuilding, with halls suitable for lectures and concerts, classrooms suitable for the studio\nwork, and a canteen creating a central meeting point for the participants to eat together. At\nthe suggestion of Wilhelm Schl\u00fcter, who was responsible for the administrative aspects of the\ncourses and the IMD archive, the Georg-B\u00fcchner-Schule was selected. Its proximity to the\nIMD building was a further factor in its favour.53 Indeed, before suggesting it to the panel\nmembers, Schl\u00fcter had made arrangements with the headmaster of the school in anticipation\nof their agreement.54\nThe basis of some of the advisory panel\u2019s changes, and in particular the innovations\nconcerning the composition classes, appears to have been some remarks made by Boulez in\na radio broadcast for the Hessischer Rundfunk. There Boulez expressed the view that\n\u2018Darmstadt must remain, with fewer people, and perhaps lasting longer\u2019. In an article in\nthe Darmst\u00e4dter Beitr\u00e4ge Ernst Thomas not only quotes that phrase,55 but also mentions\nfurther remarks by Boulez, made in an interview in Christ und Welt, to the effect that\ncomposers at Darmstadt should be encouraged to compose less and to think about compos-\nition more. What had been lost, for Boulez, was any rigorous preparation for composition,\n52 Given in the 1972 course plan held at the IMD. There were to be seven recipients of the prize in 1972: for composition,\nGillian Bibby, Hellmut Cromm, and Martin Gelhorn; for performance, Herbert Henck, Suzanne Stephens-Myers,\nGabriele Schumacher, and Yukiko Sugawara.\n53 The Georg-B\u00fcchner-Schule is on the same street as the IMD building, Nieder-Ramst\u00e4dter-Stra\u00dfe. They are also\ndirectly linked on the Darmstadt tram network, with the Georg-B\u00fcchner-Schule at the Jahnstra\u00dfe tram stop and the\nIMD building only two stops away, directly opposite the terminus of the present line 9, B\u00f6llenfalltor. It is hard to\nimagine a more convenient site for the courses, especially given the benefit of the location, midway between the two,\nof the sports hall, where numerous other lectures and performances would take place. The courses remained at the\nGeorg-B\u00fcchner-Schule until 2002.\n54 \u2018Die L\u00f6sung des Problems kam dann, wie so oft, von Wilhelm Schl\u00fcter: Er hatte nicht nur die B\u00fcchner-Schule als in\nvieler Hinsicht ideales Geb\u00e4ude in die engere Wahl einbezogen, sondern auch in k\u00fcrzester Frist eine Besichtigung\nvereinbart; dar\u00fcber hinaus hatte er auch dem Einverst\u00e4ndnis des Schulleiters schon vorgearbeitet!\u2019 (Caskel, \u2018Die\nArbeit des Programmbeirats\u2019, 411\u201312).\n55 \u2018Darmstadt mu\u00df bleiben, vielleicht auf eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Lange, nur mit weniger Leute\u2019 (Boulez, contribution to the\nbroadcast Die etablierteMusik-Avantgarde, Hessischer Rundfunk Second Programme, 9 November 1969; transcript:\nIMD); quoted by Ernst Thomas in \u2018Von der Notwendigkeit\u2019. Boulez was perhaps thinking of a model more akin to\nStockhausen\u2019s Cologne Courses or, indeed, what would become IRCAM.\n266 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nthe lack of which appeared to go hand in hand with the increased attention being paid to\nimprovisation.56\nHowever, there can be no doubt that, whatever the political expediency of the new\nstructures, one of the primary imperatives forcing change at Darmstadt was a fiscal one.\nSabais, newly elected mayor in addition to his responsibility for culture and education, had\nfound serious deficits in the city\u2019s budget. In 1971 these were reported as being in the region\nof 13.3 million marks,57 and by early 1972 they had risen to 16.1 million.58 Indeed, in the first\nnewspaper reports of the Ferienkurse\u2019s switch to a biennial pattern, financial considerations\nare accorded the most importance; the annual cost of the Ferienkurse to the city is quoted as\nbeing in the region of 165,000 marks. Despite the changes, the IMD was to be awarded 45,000\nmarks in each \u2018off \u2019 year in order to allow for improvements in the IMD\u2019s technical provi-\nsions.59 Klaus Trapp makes the point subtly but effectively when he refers to the change to a\ntwo-year pattern as a \u2018decision of the city of Darmstadt\u2019,60 the implication being that Thomas\nfound himself publicly defending a decision that had been presented to him by Sabais as a fait\naccompli. Lewinski seems to suggest, though, that a number of options may have been open\nto the courses\u2019 director: \u2018It looks\u2019, he writes, \u2018as if Ernst Thomas had toyed around with the\nidea of this break, so that finances would not become the single determining factor.\u201961 He is\nless charitable when he continues: \u2018There is nothing to be said against a break, as long as it\nbrings constructive consequences, and does not signal an exodus.\u201962\n1972. The Hausverbot\nThe real reason for the failure of the student protest, and at the same time the reason behind\nthe advisory panel\u2019s comparative success, is, in fact, implicit in Ernst Thomas\u2019s response to\nthe so-called \u2018Darmstadt Delegation\u2019, and specifically in his stated desire to achieve continu-\nity from year to year.63 In short, the rapidly changing make-up of the participants, with more\nthan sixty-five per cent attending each year for the first time,64 meant that any genuine\ncontinuity was practically impossible. As a concession to the 1970 protest, a discussion\nevening was held during the 1972 courses. The evening made it quite clear that, although\n56 This complaint regarding improvisation may be seen as a not-so-veiled criticism both of Stockhausen\u2019sEnsemble and\nMusik f\u00fcr ein Haus courses, and perhaps most especially of Aus den sieben Tagen.\n57 \u2018Ohne \u2018\u2018Trick siebzehn\u2019\u2019 eine bittere Haushalts-Wahrheit\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 23 January 1971.\n58 \u2018Defizit liegt jetzt bei 16 Millionen Mark\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Echo, 14 April 1972.\n59 See, for instance, \u2018Ferienkurse eingeschr\u00e4nkt\u2019, Spandauer Volksblatt, 6 February 1971; \u2018Ferienkurse f\u00fcr neue Musik\nnur noch alle zwei Jahre\u2019, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 6 February 1971.\n60 \u2018Nachdem der 1971 von der Stadt Darmstadt gefa\u00dfte Entschlu\u00df, die Ferienkurse fortan im Zweijahrrhythmus zu\nveranstalten\u2019 (Trapp, \u2018Darmstadt und die 68er-Bewegung, 369).\n61 \u2018Es sieht so aus, als ob Ernst Thomas mit dieser Pause sowieso gelieb\u00e4ugelt hatte, sie sich nicht erst von den Finanzen\ndikterien lie\u00df\u2019 (Lewinski, \u2018Ende der Ferienkurse?\u2019).\n62 \u2018Nichts gegen eine Pause, wenn sie konstruktive Konsequenzen zeitigt, keinen Exodus signalisiert\u2019 (Lewinski, \u2018Ende\nder Ferienkurse?\u2019).\n63 Success is meant here simply in the sense that the Advisory Committee continued in its role until Thomas\u2019s\nretirement in 1981.\n64 In 1972, according to the statistics provided by theDarmst\u00e4dter Beitr\u00e4ge, roughly eighty per cent of participants were\nattending for the first time.\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 267\nmany did wish for debate, many simply wanted to get on with the activities that had brought\nthem to Darmstadt in the first place. During the discussion a participant from Eastern\nEurope reportedly shouted out, \u2018I want to make music!\u2019.65 When the election of the following\nyear\u2019s delegation took place, only thirty participants voted.66 The changes in participation\nfrom year to year, in terms of both numbers and countries represented, created a situation in\nwhich, whatever the levels of dissatisfaction, the discontents could never bank on sufficient\nsupport. Moreover, as was implied by the predominant nationality of the elected members of\nthe Darmstadt Delegation, the objections directed against the structures and ethos of the\ncourses chiefly reflected West German preoccupations and, more particularly, those of West\nGerman journalists. Even though, in the period from 1972 to 1980, between twenty-five and\nthirty per cent of the participants were West German, so many of them must have been\nattending Darmstadt for the first time that only a minority would have been likely to be\ngenuinely sympathetic to the cause of unseating Thomas in favour of an elected committee,\nor even entirely au fait with the precise terms of the debate. Indeed, a substantial proportion\nof the German contingent may have been broadly favourable towards certain of Thomas\u2019s\npositions.67 In this sense, with the exception of flashpoints such as that of 1970, no organized\nprotest against the institution could have any guarantee of success. Conversely, the more or\nless guaranteed presence of the advisory panel from year to year gave the institution a\ncontinuity of ideology and purpose that the protesters were never likely to achieve. It is also\nperhaps worth mentioning a further, somewhat basic but significant disparity between the\nparties: the participants would have had to pay their own way in order to come to Darmstadt\nand protest, while the advisory panel would have been paid for their contribution. 1972,\nhowever, would show what small-scale protest could achieve \u2013 a single but nonetheless\nmortal blow to the perceived authority of the director and the advisory panel, even if it was\nthe bungled handling of this protest by the IMD executive that ultimately did the most to\nachieve this result.\nThe protest of 1972 originated with three journalists whose attendance would certainly\nhave been subsidized, if not fully paid for, by their respective newspaper and broadcasting\ncompanies: Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel, Ernstalbrecht Stiebler, and Rudolf Frisius.68 All were\nmembers or deputies of the previous Darmstadt Delegation, as were the two others involved,\nNicolaus A. Huber and Max E. Keller. The reduction in numbers of the protesting faction\nfrom a voting body of half the Ferienkurse participants to a small coterie of five is clearly\ncrucial, whether it ought to be taken as suggesting widespread, albeit perhaps grudging,\nsupport for the changes instituted by Thomas and the advisory panel or, equally likely,\napathy and disillusionment after the events of 1970. Significantly, all five of the current group\nhad been directly complicit in the 1970 protest. Indeed, if the events of that year can be\n65 Trumpff, \u2018Diskussion \u00fcber die Ferienkurse\u2019.\n66 \u2018Delegations-Dilemma\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 5 August 1972.\n67 This may, for instance, have been the case with Thomas\u2019s refusal to invite Cage. Although the more vocal discussions\nof Cage\u2019s presence in Germany are largely favourable, often uncritically so, there was an equally large proportion of\nfeeling that Cage was indeed the \u2018charlatan\u2019 Thomas had branded him.\n68 As mentioned above, Stiebler was a composer as well as a radio editor at the Hessischer Rundfunk. Frisius,\nmeanwhile, was active as a musicologist in addition to his journalistic writing.\n268 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nconsidered analogous to the activism of a trade union, Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel could aptly be\nviewed as its shop steward.69\nRudolf Frisius, for his part, had already publicized his opinion in an article for the Neue\nMusikzeitung entitled \u2018Who Has Ruined the Darmstadt Ferienkurse?\u2019.70 The \u2018crisis\u2019, in\nFrisius\u2019s opinion, was a \u2018crisis of the system\u2019, and the responsibility for the Darmstadt system,\nit was clear, lay squarely with the director of the Institute.71 Perhaps unfairly, Frisius fails to\nnote the city\u2019s generally parlous financial situation when he comments that the decision of\nthe Darmstadt authorities to decline to fund the courses in 1971 was quite understandable,\nsince their quality had sunk so low.72 He also mentions as a further cause of difficulties at\nDarmstadt the rising wave of factionalism, though without considering the part his own\narticle might have to play in this divisiveness. Stiebler, too, had made a similar, though rather\nless polemical, statement in an interview for the Hessischer Rundfunk, commenting on the\ngeneral \u2018stagnation\u2019 of new music and suggesting that the break in the courses in 1971 had\nbeen dictated by artistic as much as financial problems.73\nBy the time the 1972 courses began, however, it seemed that much of this public squabble\nhad petered out. There had been little further criticism in the press or on the radio, and the\ncourses themselves reached their third week without particular incident. However, on 1\nAugust the Darmst\u00e4dter Echo was the first to report that three journalists \u2013 only Oehlschl\u00e4gel\nis referred to by name \u2013 had been issued with aHausverbot, banning them from attending any\nof the public lectures or concerts, and also forbidding them to enter the Georg-B\u00fcchner-\nSchule.74 The paper reported that the ban had been issued the previous day, 31 July 1971,\n69 Again \u2013 and perhaps still more strongly \u2013 the group of five is reminiscent of the structure of the Deutscher Presserat\nand its own five-member panels.\n70 \u2018Wer hat die Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse ruiniert?\u2019 (1971).\n71 \u2018Die Darmst\u00e4dter Krise ist eine Krise des Systems\u2019 (Frisius, \u2018Wer hat die Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse ruiniert?\u2019).\n72 \u2018Das Niveau ist inzwischen so gesunken, da\u00df [. . .] [es] v\u00f6llig verst\u00e4ndlich [ist], wenn ausgerechnet in diesem Stadium\ndie Stadt Darmstadt, die die Ferienkurse 1971 nicht mehr finanzieren will, zur Subventionierung einer Darmst\u00e4dter\nEnzyklop\u00e4die der Neuen Musik \u00fcberredet will\u2019 (Frisius, \u2018Wer hat die Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse ruiniert?\u2019).\n73 This interview was broadcast onDasMusikjournal, Hessischer Rundfunk, 29 January 1971 (transcript available at the\nIMD). Ernst Thomas himself broadcast a response on the same radio station on 3 February 1971, suggesting that he\ndid not feel it particularly helpful to talk of a general crisis in new music itself (transcript also available at the IMD).\n74 \u2018Hausverbot f\u00fcr Journalisten\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Echo, 1 August 1972. Trudu (La \u2018Scuola\u2019 di Darmstadt, 220) fails to assess\nthe correct sequence of events, presuming that Thomas barred the protesters from the courses and that, in response,\nOehlschl\u00e4gel quite reasonably aired his grievances. Furthermore, Trudu seems to presume that it was Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s\npamphlet that created the need for a discussion evening, so that Thomas could explain himself. On the contrary,\nhowever, Oehlschl\u00e4gel was distributing a pamphlet seen by Thomas as inflammatory in advance of a general meeting,\nwhich Thomas had already planned as a concession to the demands of the Darmstadt Delegation. Thus, in response,\nThomas barred the protesters. Thomas\u2019s actions are, in any case, much more understandable as a reaction than as a\npre-emptive strike of some sort. Trudu\u2019s error is no doubt in part a result of having used a later national press source,\nthe more ostensibly reputableFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, rather than one of the two local newspapers. Unlike the\nDarmst\u00e4dter Echo, the Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung gives no indication of the date of the ban. This mistake is\ncertainly understandable because of the post-war condition of press concentration in West Germany, where many of\nthe local papers, such as the Darmst\u00e4dter Echo, became nothing more than subsidiaries of larger press groups. The\nlocal papers were still marketed as if they were independent organs, but their contents would be conspicuously\nsimilar to other local papers, often with little more than a change of cover sheet. Trudu was perhaps presuming that\nthe first printing of a story would take place on the same day across an entire West German media group. For more\ninformation on press concentration in West Germany see Humphreys,Media andMedia Policy, 74\u201383. According to\nBeal, however, the letters to the pamphlet signatories were dated 30 July 1972. Since the discussion evening also took\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 269\nwith Ernst Thomas commenting that it was in response to \u2018the calumnious activities that\nhave been clearly in evidence since 1970\u2019.75 Oehlschl\u00e4gel is quoted in the same article as\nclaiming that the ban was issued specifically in order to prevent his distribution of a pamphlet\ndetailing the Darmstadt Delegation\u2019s opinion of the continuing flaws in the decision-making\nprocedures, as well as the actual programme of the courses, in advance of the discussion\nmeeting mentioned above.76 Although no copy of this pamphlet appears to have survived,\nthe consensus seems to be that the Melos article entitled \u2018The 1970 Darmstadt Delegation\nConsiders the Results\u2019, credited in that publication to all five members of the Delegation, is\nidentical to it.77\nDespite the ban, it seems clear that the issues outlined by Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s pamphlet still\nreached the discussion evening. At the start of the evening Thomas explained to the partici-\npants the reasons for the issuing of the ban. It seems that the same letter had been sent to each\nof the journalists, as well as to Max Keller. Thomas read an extract of it to the assembled\nparticipants: \u2018You have signed a pamphlet containing direct untruths and spiteful manipu-\nlations of the facts directed against the course director and the advisory panel, by which you\nhave supported attempts to stir up the participants and poison the working atmosphere.\u201978 If\nthe pamphlet was indeed identical to the Melos article, Thomas\u2019s letter comes across as\nextreme in its reaction. The Melos article, in fact, compliments the leadership for having\nbroadened the outlook of the courses to include Kagel, Xenakis, and Wolff in the 1972\nprogramme. Beyond that, its six key demands, paralleling those Gustav Adolf Trumpff\nreports as having featured in the original pamphlet,79 were as follows:\n1 For professional translators, both to increase the number and enhance the experience of\nparticipants from non-German-, non-French-, and non-English-speaking countries.\nplace on 30 July 1972, and none of the signatories was present, these letters must have been hand-delivered to them;\nsee Beal, \u2018Patronage and Reception History\u2019, 257.\n75 \u2018weil sie \u2013 wie der Institutsdirektor am Montag auf Anfrage erkl\u00e4rte \u2013 Auflagen f\u00fcr ihre Zulassung nicht erf\u00fcllten und\n\u2018\u2018die bereits seit 1970 gezeigten verleumderischen Aktivit\u00e4ten\u2019\u2019 nicht unterlie\u00dfen\u2019 (\u2018Hausverbot f\u00fcr Journalisten\u2019,\nDarmst\u00e4dter Echo).\n76 \u2018Demgegen\u00fcber erkl\u00e4rte einer der betroffenen Journalisten, der Deutschlandfunk-Redakteur Reinhard Oehlschl\u00e4gel\n(K\u00f6ln), mit dem Hausverbot solle lediglich verhindert werden, da\u00df den Kursteilnehmern mit einem Flugblatt der\nBericht einer Delegation zur Kenntnis gebracht werde, in dem sowohl die Entscheidungsstruktur als auch die\nmangelnde Aktulit\u00e4t des Programms kritisiert wird\u2019 (\u2018Hausverbot f\u00fcr Journalisten\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Echo).\n77 Oehlschl\u00e4gel and others, \u2018Die Darmst\u00e4dter Delegation von 1970 zieht das Fazit\u2019. In an interview with Amy Beal,\nRudolf Frisius stated that the pamphlet and the article were identical with each other. Antonio Trudu also treats them\nas if they were so.\n78 Given that the content of Thomas\u2019s speech here and the content of the letter acquired by Amy Beal from Ursula\nStiebler are identical, it seems likely that an identical letter was indeed sent to each of the signatories. The complete\nGerman text as given by Beal reads as follows: \u2018Zu unserem Bedauern haben wir festgestellt, da\u00df Sie ein gegen\ndie Kursleitung und den Programmbeirat gerichtetes Unwahrheiten in der Sache und b\u00f6swillige Verdrehungen\nenthaltendes Pamphlet unterzeichnet und damit den Versuch unterst\u00fctzt haben, die Teilnehmer aufzuwiegeln\nund die Arbeitsatmosph\u00e4re zu vergiften. Wir sehen uns daher gen\u00f6tigt, Ihnen ab sofort den Besuch s\u00e4mtlicher\nVeranstaltungen der Ferienkurse, auch der \u00f6ffentlichen, sowie das Betreten der Georg-B\u00fcchner-Schule zu untersa-\ngen\u2019 (see Beal, \u2018Patronage and Reception History\u2019, 257). Klaus Trapp quotes Thomas\u2019s speech; see \u2018Darmstadt und\ndie 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 372. Beal appears to suggest that Thomas held the meeting specifically to explain his decision.\nHowever, this meeting is more likely to have been one of the already planned discussion forums, and Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s\npamphlet was almost certainly being distributed in readiness for this event.\n79 Trumpff, \u2018Diskussion \u00fcber die Ferienkurse\u2019.\n270 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\n2 For a discussion on the new beginning offered by a political music aesthetic.\n3 For a comparative reduction in the number of performances by established composers,\nsuch as Kagel, Xenakis, Ligeti, and Stockhausen.\n4 For an increase in the number of performers.80\n5 For the institution of press conferences, and greater press involvement in Ferienkurse\nactivities.\n6 For the resignation of the current advisory panel and the election of a new one, in the light\nof Thomas\u2019s refusal to allow the Darmstadt Delegation to participate in the decision-\nmaking process.81\nAt the discussion evening, which, owing to the ban on their presence in the Georg-B\u00fcchner-\nSchule, none of the protesters could attend, Aloys Kontarsky, flanked by Caskel and Palm,\nresponded to some of Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s criticisms. Kontarsky argued that lectures by Dahlhaus\nand Brinkmann on the subject of \u2018Political and Aesthetic Criteria for the Critique of\nComposition\u2019, as well as the performance of Nicolaus A. Huber\u2019s Harakiri (1971\u20132), repre-\nsented clear steps in the direction of a discussion on musico-political aesthetics. He also\nretorted that the newly introduced composers\u2019 and performers\u2019 studios, along with the\nstudio concerts at the end of the courses, would allow a much broader spectrum of music to\nbe presented by the actual participants, as well as from the \u2018big name\u2019 composers.82 With\nregard to the question of professional translation, Ligeti and Dahlhaus both warned that, in\ntheir experience, the use of non-musically competent professional translators could result in\nmore confusion than illumination,83 and that, moreover, most of the lecturers had already\ngiven their lectures in several languages, or at least provided a written summary in other\nlanguages.84\nThe last two points of criticism raised by the pamphlet seem to have given Thomas and the\nadvisory panel the impression that much of its agenda was bound up with Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s own\njournalistic concerns. At least, this was quickly adopted as the IMD\u2019s \u2018official line\u2019 against the\ncriticism. The Hausverbot against Stiebler was quickly retracted because he was due to take\npart in a performance of Schnebel\u2019s Atemz\u00fcge on 1 August 1971, and that of Max Keller was\nwithdrawn because he was an active participant in the courses, not a journalist, although the\n80 It is unclear for what purpose more performers were required. Given the state of the studio concerts in the early\n1980s, when student string players would complain of near-physical attack to secure their services, it seems most\nlikely that Oehlschl\u00e4gel is pointing out that, although in theory the studio concerts allow young composers to have\ntheir music performed, there are insufficient student instrumentalists to make a greater number of performances of\nstudent work viable.\n81 The protesters\u2019 third point is particularly anomalous: having only just acknowledged the benefits of including Kagel\nand Xenakis in the Darmstadt faculty, they appear now to criticize them for being too established.\n82 See Trapp, \u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 373.\n83 \u2018Zum anderen warnten Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti und Carl Dahlhaus aus eigenen schlechten Erfahrungen, da\u00df musikalisch nicht\nkompetente Dolmetscher mehr Verwirrung als Nutzen stiften\u2019 (Trumpff, \u2018Diskussion \u00fcber die Ferienkurse\u2019).\n84 \u2018Fast alle Dozenten haben auch in diesem Jahr ihre Kurse und Vortr\u00e4ge mehrsprachig gehalten oder wenigstens ein\nschriftliches fremdsprachiges Res\u00fcmee gegeben\u2019 (Trumpff, \u2018Diskussion \u00fcber die Ferienkurse\u2019). Ligeti, for example,\nhad given his lectures three times, in German, English, and French. Xenakis had taken a show of hands at the\nbeginning of his first lecture to ascertain the most suitable language for his presentation, which, as a result, was given\nin English.\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 271\nintervention of various members of the lecturing staff assisted this conclusion.85 The anti-\njournalistic stance was echoed in Aloys Kontarsky\u2019s response to Oehlschl\u00e4gel, published\nalongside the pamphlet text in Melos. There Kontarsky insisted that the programme was\ndrawn up for the participants, not the press.86 However, it soon became clear that the use of\nthis stance to defend the imposition of theHausverbot had been a damaging misjudgement.87\nTrapp relates that fellow reporters of Oehlschl\u00e4gel, Frisius, and Stiebler quickly began to\ncomplain that the ban represented a restriction of press freedom,88 and Thomas was forced,\nsomewhat embarrassingly, to have to defend himself in public once more.89 Even so, it seems\nlikely that the discontent implied by Oehlschl\u00e4gel\u2019s pamphlet was far from as widespread as\nmight be inferred. The numbers involved in the new elections for a fresh Darmstadt\nDelegation would hardly have been sufficient to form a quorum in any ballot. Furthermore,\nFrisius himself has claimed not only that he did not sign the pamphlet, but also that he saw a\ncopy of it only after the Hausverbot had been issued, Oehlschl\u00e4gel having written it indepen-\ndently.90 As for the mass of the participants, their attitude, arguably just as dangerous for the\ninstitution itself, may well have been, in truth, one of apathy.\nIn an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Friedrich Hommel presents a view of\nevents that seems strongly to endorse the opinion that this particular \u2018scandal\u2019 was a product\nof media spin rather than of general disquiet. Ostensibly, this article represents Hommel\u2019s\nannual review of the Ferienkurse. Yet it is much lengthier than the pieces he had previously\ndelivered for this purpose, and the main thrust deals with an examination of the media\npressure against Ernst Thomas since 1969. Hommel seeks to demonstrate that the bulk of the\npolitical and media activity against the leadership of the Ferienkurse can be traced back\nultimately to Oehlschl\u00e4gel, although he also mentions articles by Frisius and Stiebler, as well\nas a television programme made by Hans G. Helms at the 1970 courses for the Westdeutscher\nRundfunk. He defends Thomas\u2019s view that Darmstadt should be governed on the basis of\nartistic rather than political decisions, even if the artistic decisions would be those of the\ndirector and the advisory panel. He also underlines the irony of the fact that the protests\nprofess the ambition of democratization. Since the dissent had come from only a small\nfaction of the press, their proposals for change could hardly be considered more democratic\nthan the decisions taken by the director of the IMD. Hommel reminds his readers that even\n85 \u2018Den Ausschlu\u00df von Herrn Keller haben wir auf F\u00fcrsprache von Dozenten zur\u00fcckgenommen \u2013 weil er Teilnehmer\nist\u2019 (\u2018Drohen weitere Aussperungen?\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 7 August 1972).\n86 \u2018Wir haben die Programme f\u00fcr die Teilnehmer, nicht f\u00fcr die Presse, aufgestellt\u2019 (Kontarsky, \u2018Antwort\u2019, 361).\n87 Frisius was a university lecturer by profession. In a later exchange of correspondence between himself and Thomas\nhe suggests that, because he was not a professional journalist, he had not acted \u2018improperly\u2019 by describing the\nFerienkurse as he had. Where a journalist would be expected to provide an entirely balanced approach, as a lecturer\nit was entirely reasonable that he had provided a much more personal reaction. This exchange was prompted by\nFrisius\u2019s application to come to the 1974 Ferienkurse. Thomas pronounced himself \u2018entirely astonished\u2019 that Frisius\nwished to return, in a letter dated 6 June 1974 (held at the IMD).\n88 Trapp, \u2018Darmstadt und die 68-er Bewegung\u2019, 372. See, for instance, Ign\u00e9e, \u2018Die Moral von Darmstadt\u2019, and\nJungheinrich, \u2018Kampfsprache der Unfreiheit\u2019.\n89 See the interview \u2018Drohen weitere Aussperrungen?\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 7 August 1972.\n90 See Beal, \u2018Patronage and Reception History\u2019, 256\u20137, nn. 72\u20133. It is worth noting nonetheless that Frisius\u2019s signature\nwas not withdrawn from the version published in Melos a few months later; see Oehlschl\u00e4gel and others, \u2018Die\nDarmst\u00e4dter Delegation von 1970 zieht das Fazit\u2019.\n272 Iddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972\nat Darmstadt\u2019s most politically dynamic moment, namely the 1970 courses, the Darmstadt\nDelegation had been elected by less than half the body of participants. He concludes by\nagreeing with Oehlschl\u00e4gel that the \u2018Darmstadt Affair\u2019, as he terms it, was a scandal, but a\nscandal that merely exposed the dubious practices of a small journalistic clique.91 Hommel\u2019s\narticle, though no doubt intended in part as a defence of Ernst Thomas, had the effect of\nsparking a fresh round of argument, with further vitriol on both sides.92 The damage this\ncontinuing quarrel caused to the already blemished public image of the Ferienkurse was\nconsiderable.\nAs Trudu observes, with this Hausverbot \u2018for Thomas, the door was closed on renewal\nonce and for all\u2019.93 Although it is quite clear that Thomas, Caskel, Kontarsky, and Palm had\nbegun to institute many changes, some of which were certainly in line with the requests of the\nDarmstadt Delegation, it is equally clear that this further public squabble at Darmstadt\ninjured Thomas\u2019s leadership irrevocably. For here the media, which were responsible for the\ncommon perception of Darmstadt, directly challenged Thomas. Not only that, but Thomas\u2019s\nposition was damaged further by the failure of his actions: the Hausverbot itself was clearly\ndisproportionate; it hardly represented the democratic touch that was required. Moreover,\nStiebler and Keller were readmitted after only a day, and Oehlschl\u00e4gel and Frisius attended\nthe public events of the Ferienkurse in defiance of the ban. Ernst Thomas somewhat limply\nclaimed that the fact that further steps were not taken against Frisius and Oehlschl\u00e4gel,\ndespite their continuing presence, was representative of the \u2018liberality\u2019 of the Darmstadt\nleadership.94\nWhatever its motives, the protest of 1972 exposed the impotence of the Darmstadt\nleadership to challenge criticism. Despite an apparently burgeoning institutional restructur-\ning, the inept handling of both this and the previous protest of 1970 created a situation in\nwhich renewal was blocked for the foreseeable future. This is to say that, even were regen-\neration to achieve success on an organizational level, it would no longer be reported as such\nby the media, whose pessimism would continue unabated until the retirement of Ernst\nThomas. Genuine artistic renewal at Darmstadt would now have to wait until the tenure\nof Hommel in the 1980s. While Thomas\u2019s reforms had undoubtedly prepared the ground\nfor his successor, the damage done to his leadership by the crisis of 1972 ensured that he\nwould never be allowed to take due credit for them. The events of the years either side of\nDarmstadt\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary seriously undermined the efficacy of the institutional\n91 Hommel, \u2018Musik nach revolution\u00e4rem Gesamtkonzept?\u2019.\n92 The October\u2013November 1972 issue of the Neue Musikzeitung carries a lengthy article from Rudolf Frisius (\u2018Ein\nmusikalisches Forum verliert sein Format\u2019) that is critical but hardly unfair. However, in the December 1972\u2013\nJanuary 1973 issue Oehlschl\u00e4gel and Hommel are once again in direct conflict, and even Sabais is drawn into the\nargument. The debate had also reached the Swiss press, with an article in the Basel-based National-Zeitung by Max\nKeller (\u2018Seltsame \u2018\u2018Demokratien\u2019\u2019 in Darmstadt\u2019) criticizing Gustav Trumpff \u2019s reporting of events. Trumpff \u2019s reply,\nheavily laced with sarcasm, appears not to have been printed, but a copy of the text, dated 18 August 1972, is available\nin the IMD archive.\n93 \u2018Fu praticamente con quello Hausverbot che la porta del rinnovamento si chiuse definitivamente alle spalle di\nThomas\u2019 (Trudu, La \u2018Scuola\u2019 di Darmstadt, 222).\n94 \u2018Da\u00df wir nicht gegen ihr [Frisius and Oehlschl\u00e4gel] Erscheinen eingeschritten sind, darf man als Zeichen unser\nLiberalit\u00e4t verstehen\u2019 (\u2018Drohen weitere Aussperrungen\u2019, Darmst\u00e4dter Tagblatt, 7 August 1972).\nIddon Trying To Speak: Between Politics and Aesthetics, Darmstadt 1970\u20131972 273\nframework that had supported the post-war avant-garde and, amidst what now seemed like\nthe crumbling edifice of the avant-garde\u2019s chief fortress, all that appeared to remain standing,\nseemingly forgotten in the institutional conflict of the previous three years, was the courses\u2019\ncentral figure, Karlheinz Stockhausen.95\nRadio Broadcasts\nDie etablierte Musik-Avantgarde.

The sort of small-scale protest that was capable of\ndamaging Thomas\u2019s leadership in 1972 had similar ramifications for Stockhausen in 1974, although Stockhausen\nhimself was responsible in part for his own downfall. In response to his expulsion of a Finnish student from his\ncourses in 1974, a small group of leftist composers, Johannes Vetter, Gerhard St\u00e4bler, and J\u00fcrgen L\u00f6sche, issued a\npamphlet that seemed to reflect the general feeling at the 1974 courses that Stockhausen was out of touch and had\noverstayed his welcome.
