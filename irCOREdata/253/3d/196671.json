Doi: 10.1016\/j.ijengsci.2010.05.001Metadata only entryWe study the laminar boundary-layer flow over a general spheroid rotating in otherwise still fluid.

An eccentricity parameter e is used to distinguish particular bodies within the oblate or prolate families and the laminar-flow equations are established for each family with e as a parameter. In each case, setting e = 0 reduces the equations to those already established in the literature for the rotating sphere. We begin by solving the laminar-flow equations at each latitude using a series-solution approximation. A comparison is then made to solutions obtained from an accurate numerical method. The two solutions are found to agree well for a large range of latitudes and eccentricities, and at these locations the series solution is to be preferred due to its simplicity and ease of computation.
