Failures decrease production as well as erode profits. Hence it is \ndesirable to: \n\u2022 deal effectively with each type of failure;  \n\u2022 move towards a more proactive-maintenance approach; \n\u2022 address how to extend the run length between shut-downs i.e., the mean-time \nbetween failures (MTBFs); and \n 2 \n\u2022 harness the cooperation of all those involved in or affected by the maintenance \nfunctions  \nSo consideration is focused on equipment condition, operation standards, reasons for \ndeteriorations, the quality-management approach to improve the output, while \nsimultaneously significantly reducing the overall operational cost. Hence ways are sought \nto install maintenance methodologies that will significantly reduce operational and \nmaintenance costs by focusing on the root cause of failure through creating a sense of \nownership in each of the plant-equipment operators, maintainers and support staff so as to \nencourage \u2018a prevention of problems at source\u2019 attitude. Two compatible processes, \nnamely, reliability-centred maintenance (RCM) and total productive maintenance (TPM) \nare likely to help confront and overcome these challenges. A strategic framework \nmethodology will be developed for developing a cost-effective maintenance plan by \nidentifying:- \n\u2022 what is wanted of the plant\/equipment? \n\u2022 what the plant\/equipment can do? \n\u2022 in which way may it fail to meet the requirement? \n\u2022 what can be done to ensure that the equipment meets expectations in a safe \nand cost effective manner? \n \nPreventive Maintenance (PM) \nIn PM, the system which is highly likely to exhibit a demobilising fault is replaced before \nthat failure is allowed to occur. The most common forms of this policy are scheduled PM \nand condition-based maintenance (CBM). In the former approach, the PM action is \nperformed on the item at a scheduled time regardless of its actual condition. Because the \nschedule is often drawn up on the supplier\u2019s recommendation, but made with either only \nlimited local knowledge of the actual use conditions or from past experience, it is seldom \nan optimal procedure. PM schedules that minimize resource consumption or maximize \navailability can be determined through the use of quantitative decision-models, based on \nfactual information such as time-to-failure distributions, cost of intervention (e.g. for \ninspection, repair or replacement) and consequences of failure. Models for the \noptimization of PM decisions have been published [1-3]. \n \nCondition \u2013 based maintenance (CBM) \nUnder the regime of a scheduled PM policy some components may be over maintained, \nthat is replaced prematurely. However, if the condition of the item can be monitored \ncontinuously or even frequently, PM actions will be implemented only when failure is \njudged to be imminent. This is the basic concept of CBM. Performance-parameter \nanalysis, vibration monitoring, thermography, oil analysis or ferrography are some \ncondition-monitoring techniques that are involved in CBM. Each of these methods will \nreveal a specific type of fault. For example, vibration-monitoring can be employed to \ndetect wear, imbalance, misalignment, loosened assembles or turbulence in plant with \nrotational or reciprocating parts. For optimizing replacement decisions, an operational-\nresearch (OR) models which takes into account the information obtained from \nmonitoring, has been described by Markis and Jardine [4] .A survey of the recent CBM \nmodels can be found in Tsang [5]. \n \n 3 \nTHE CHALLENGE \nProactive maintenance (PM) should reduce the need for reactive maintenance (RM). \nEffective PM activities enable a company to achieve a ratio of more than 80 percent PM \nto less than 20 percent RM. Once the ratio complies with this, other maintenance \npractices become more effective. However, less than 1 percent of those employed in \nindustries in Nigeria understand that PM programmes are effective. \n \nToday\u2019s competitive environment requires that industries sustain full productive \ncapacities while minimizing the required capital investment. From the maintenance \nperspective, this means maximizing equipment reliability (and hence up-time), by \nextending each individual component\u2019s life. This proactive shift requires total quality-\nmaintenance (TQM), that is the planning and implementation of preventive maintenance \ninvolving both operational and maintenance staff. TQM is based on:- \n\u2022 having a maintenance organization and administration \n\u2022 maintenance-management information process \n\u2022 technical documentation \n\u2022 logistics support \n\u2022 measures of effectiveness \n\u2022 work control \n\u2022 multi-skill workforce \n\u2022 maintenance tasks \n\u2022 maintenance and reliability engineering. \n \nAs production systems have had to become more competitive, reducing downtime has \ngrown in importance. In refineries, the maintenance and operation departments are often \namong the largest and each may require about 30 percent of total staffing [6]. \nMaintenance preserves the functions of assets, and affects issues such as product quality, \ncustomer service, economy of operation, compliance with environmental regulations, and \neven the physical appearance of the asset [7]. Routine maintenance is about reducing the \noccurrence of failure and diverting energy expenditures away from activities, which have \nlittle or no effect on the overall operation. \n \nMaintenance policies should be formulated by personnel involved in the production and \nmaint4enance operations. The role of management is to provide the tools to help \noperators make the right decisions and to ensure that those decisions are sensible and \ndefensible. A successful, sustainable maintenance programme will probably only be \ndeveloped by maintenance personnel and the users of the assets working together. \n \nImproving maintenance procedures usually require [7]: \n\u2022 a change of attitude; and \n\u2022 getting maintenance personnel to apply the resulting proposed changes one at \na time, ensuring each time that an improvement occurs. \n \nMaintenance has recently become ever more challenging [8] because: \n\u2022 The conventional wisdom-embracing \u201ceconomics of scale\u201d is losing \nfollowers. An increasing number of organizations have switched to lean \n 4 \nmanufacturing, just-in-time production and\/or six-sigma programmes. These \nhighlight a shift of emphasis from achieving a high volume rate of output to a \nquick response, elimination of waste and defect prevention. Because of  the \nelimination of slack in such ever more demanding environments, then \nbreakdowns, speed loss and erratic process yield will create occasional crises \nfor the timely supply of products and services to customers. Optimizing the \nmaintenance of the production system and the effective development of \nmanpower to perform the maintenance activities are crucial to support these \nemerging operation strategies. \n\u2022 Rapid technological changes \n \nIn the past, companies tended to produce adequate, standard goods and services to satisfy \nthe insatiable demands of customers: these companies were protected from the onslaught \nof outside competition through regulation or the imposition of trade barriers in their home \nmarket. Production runs tended to be long due to technological changes being \nimplemented only poorly and the tolerance of customers who would accept what was \navailable. Most people perceived work merely as a means of earning a living. However, \nespecially in affluent societies, even then personnel tended to want to improve their \nquality-of-life at work. Improvements in available education and increased loyalty in \nprogressive organizations has led to highly successful horizontal management-structures, \nself-managing teams, virtual organizations and strategic alliances: some of these would \nbe appropriate for improving today\u2019s maintenance services in Nigeria. \n \nMAINTENANCE IN NIGERIAN INDUSTRIES \nEffective maintenance ensures that the equipment is capable of doing what it was \ndesigned to do, when required. In Nigerian industries, maintenance is not given a high \npriority and hence plants are often under utilized and run at high costs. The problems are \nthat:- \n\u2022 Not many senior mangers have pertinent knowledge and maintenance experience. \n\u2022 There is no maintenance education course in Nigeria universities \n\u2022 Maintenance budgets are inadequate \n\u2022 Many organizations regard maintenance as a cost centre rather than a business \ncentre. \nThese challenges are difficult to overcome but nevertheless maintenance is often the \nmajor activity, accounting for up to 40% of total costs, in some Nigeria companies. Poor \nmaintenance can result in lost production, poor end-product quality and customer \ndissatisfaction. The following pertinent problems have been identified within Nigeria \nindustries. \n\u2022 Maintenance is not regarded seriously even at local management level \n\u2022 Maintenance lacks a business culture (e.g. undertaken without business plans, \nineffective budget allocation; and unfocused reports produced.) \n\u2022 Maintenance supervisors and team leaders frequently lack management skills. \n\u2022 Maintenance often remains isolated, with little integration with the functions of \nother departments (e.g. production) \n\u2022 Only low levels of planned maintenance are implemented. \n 5 \n\u2022 Recently, however there has been a preoccupation with the introduction of \nadvanced maintenance methods, which fail due to a lack of basic maintenance \nethos existing. \n\u2022 Regular scheduled overhauls (i.e. usually the current practice) are incompatible \nwith achieving recommended maintenance practice as implemented by the worlds \nleading industries. \n \nIn most companies in Nigeria, repairs and replacement only ensue after a breakdown. \nAlso failure data are rarely available. In the traditional general management of \ncompanies, maintenance is regarded as an expense that can easily be reduced in relation \nto overall business costs, particularly in the short term. This is a misguided opinion. \nHowever, to increase the availability and reliability of equipment, more commitment is \nneeded to maintenance. It is now increasingly realised that achieving high-quality \nmaintenance requires prevention at source and a focus on identifying and eliminating the \ncause of equipment deterioration rather than the more traditional approach of either \nletting the equipment fail before repairing it or \u201cfire fighting\u201d in the case of an \nemergency. Maintenance practice improves with the adoption of benchmark standards \narising from the worlds best, and having pertinently trained personnel with commitments \nto continual professional development. \n \nTwo proactive maintenance practices (RCM and TPM) have been identified and their \nimplementation recommended [9]. RCM is a structured, logical process for developing or \noptimizing the maintenance requirements of a physical system to realize its \u201cinherent \nreliability\u201d. This reliability depends on both the equipment\u2019s design, construction and \nhow it is used. RCM is a methodology based on the following precepts; \n\u2022 failure is an unsatisfactory condition; \n\u2022 the consequences of failure determine the priority of the maintenance effort to be \nexpended; \n\u2022 equipment redundancies should be eliminated; \n\u2022 CBM or predictive-maintenance tactics are favoured over traditional fixed-period \nschedules methods; and \n\u2022 where warranted, run-to-failure is accepted. \nThe high-quality approach of prevention at source was translated to the maintenance \nenvironment through the concept of TPM [9]. This results in superior availability, \nreliability and maintainability of the equipment and also in significant improvements in \ncapacity with a substantial reduction in both maintenance costs and total operating cost. \nTPM is focused on applying preventive\/predictive strategies to identify and repair \nequipment before deterioration ensues. \n\u2022 Total productive maintenance (TPM) involves all production personnel in \nappropriate maintenance tasks via the use of self-directed small work groups [10]. \n\u2022 Root-cause analysis (RCA) classifies the problem into associated categories, such \nas people, procedures or hardware, and tries to prevent recurrences of the \nproblem. \n\u2022 Reliability-engineering principles (REPs) are applied to solve problems so leading \nto reductions in the overall cost arising from unreliability. \n \n 6 \nVisser [11] modelled maintenance as a transformation process encapsulated in an \nenterprise system such as shown in figure 1. The way maintenance is performed will \ninfluence the availability of production facilities, the rate of production, quality of end-\nproduct and cost of production, as well as the safety of the operation. These factors in \nturn will determine the profitability of the enterprise.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Input-Output model for an activity \n \nThe four strategic dimensions of maintenance [8] are: \n\u2022 Service-delivery options i.e. the choice between using an in-house capability and \nan outsourced service. \n\u2022 Organization of the maintenance function and the way the task is structured. \n\u2022 Maintenance methodology, i.e. the selection of the preferred maintenance policy \nor policies. \n\u2022 Design of the infrastructure that supports the maintenance function. \n \nUnprecedentedly high business-performance can be achieved if the available skills and \nresources are focussed on a limited set of core competences, i.e. a bundle of skills and \ntechnologies that enable one to provide a particular benefit to customers [12]. Thus, \nmaintenance activities for which the company has neither a strategy nor the special \nexpertise required are prime candidates to be outsourced. Maintenance activities, which \nthe company can typically outsource, include the maintenance and repair of electronic \nand environmental equipment, mobile vehicles and buildings [1]. \n \nThe appropriate maintenance approach can be determined using RCM methodology, \nwhich provides a structure for determining the maintenance requirement of any physical \nasset, with the primary object of reducing the system\u2019s function-cost [7, 1]. Performing a \nsystem\u2019s function failure analysis, for the first time, is labour intensive and time \nconsuming. RCM draws on the operators\u2019 intimate knowledge about the deteriorating \nequipment and requires their resourcefulness to develop innovative, more cost-effective \nways of performing the PM tasks. The collaboration should nurture teamwork spirit \nbetween operational and maintenance personnel, replacing the adversarial relationships \nand disputes arising from the perceived boundaries of responsibilities, which commonly \nEnterprise System \nProduction System \nMaintenance \nprocess \nLabour \nSafety \nMaterials \nSpares \nAvailability \nOutput \nMaintainability \nProfit \nTools \nInformation \nMoney \nExternal  \nservices \n 7 \nexist. Furthermore the learning, deductions and communications arising from RCM \nstudies will enhance the intellectual base of the organisation [8]. \n \nThe optimization of inspection, maintenance and replacement-decisions depends on the \navailability of high-quality pertinent data [8]. E-maintenance, an emerging concept that \nexploits the potential of digital technologies, offers new options to deal with this \nchallenge. An important restraint that inhibits the rapid adoption of e-maintenance is the \nsecurity concern associated with transactions over the internet. Risk management in e-\nmaintenance activities involves a trade-off between production on the one hand and \nfunctionality, performance and ease-of-use on the other [13]. Careful requirement-\nidentification, ensuring a systematic approach with clear aims and goals, is needed when \nperforming a risk analysis [14]. Each study should establish the importance of a well-\nplanned requirement specification and the need to analyze and interpret risk-analyses \nbefore making maintenance decisions. Prioritization within maintenance has become \nincreasingly important in several branches of industry due to the increased competition. \nIn order to maintain at least adequate profit-margins, organizations have to control \nmaintenance costs. However, in doing so, they need to minimize or eliminate risks to \nindividuals, the environment and utilised physical assets. In order to identify faults in \nterms of where they are located in a system and how serious their consequences are, a \nrisk analysis should be a prerequisite to any major operation. This will provide guidance \nas to where maintenance actions should be directed. RCM uses function analysis, in \ncombination with risk analysis, in prioritizing the required maintenance actions [7]. \n \nThrough the 1980s, in the USA and Japan, the developed corporate maintenance \nstrategies involved significant paradigm shifts, such as uptime maintenance, inter-trade \nflexibility within the maintenance workforce, as well as the amalgamation of the roles of \nplant operators and front-line maintenance personnel. This paved the way for the \nintroduction of autonomous maintenance, a key element of TPM [15], which required the \nimplementation of following procedures:- \n\u2022 Cultivating a sense of ownership in the operator by introducing autonomous \nmaintenance, i.e. the operator takes responsibility for the primary care of his\/her \nplant. \n\u2022 Optimizing the operator\u2019s skills and knowledge of his\/her plant in order to \nmaximize operating effectiveness: the operator is thus mobilized to detect early \nsigns of wear, maladjustments, leaks, errant chips or loose parts. He\/she is also \ninvolved in making improvement suggestions to eliminate losses due to the \nbreakdown or sub-optimal performance of the plant. \n\u2022 Using cross-functional teams, consisting of operators, maintainers, engineers and \nmanagers to improve the overall-plant\u2019s performance. \n\u2022 Establishing a schedule of clean-up and preventive maintenance to extend the \nplant\u2019s life-span and maximize its uptime. \n \nRCM is an asset-centred methodology, with a primary focus on making decisions with \nrespect to the type of maintenance tasks to be undertaken. TPM, on the other hand, \nfocuses on people and is an integral component of total quality-management (TQM). The \nmethodology was developed in Japan\u2019s manufacturing industries, initially, with the aim \n 8 \nof eliminating production losses due to machine breakdowns in just-in- time (JIT) \nproduction processes. TPM usually requires changes in employees\u2019 attitudes and their \nstandards of behaviour, which may take a long time to accomplish. Senior managers must \ndemonstrate their commitments to TPM by devoting and allocating sufficient resources to \ncreate and sustain cultural changes, e.g. to provide the necessary training for all involved \npersonnel to achieve autonomous maintenance. \n \nIntroducing the strategic initiatives, such as multi-skill, inter-trade flexibility, \noutsourcing, RCM, TPM, as well as the redesign of work processes and structures, often \nfails to deliver the expected benefits [8]. The main reason for this is that the required \nethos, management behaviour and processes (including pertinent information collating \nand use, training, performance management and rewards) were not in place when the \nparadigm change programmes were implemented. \n \nMAINTENANCE MISSION \nIt is wise to develop a formal mission-statement to help maintenance personnel perform \nwell [16]. \u2018\u2019Maintain\u2019\u2019 means \u201ccause to continue\u201d. Maintenance exists because we have \nphysical assets which deteriorate. The function we wish to preserve must be one the user \nwants it to be. Maintenance affects three distinct sets of customers - the owners of the \nsystem, its users (usually the operators) and society as a whole. Owners are usually \nsatisfied if their system generates a satisfactory financial return on their financial \ninvestment. Users are satisfied if their system continues to operate at the required \nstandard of performance. Society as whole is satisfied if the system does not fail in any \nway that threatens public safety or damages the environment. \n \nThe technology of maintenance is concerned with finding and applying suitable ways of \nmanaging or preventing failure. Failure management includes predictive and preventive \nmaintenance, failure-finding, run-to-failure and necessary one-time changes to the design \nof the system or the way it is operated. Each category includes a host of options, some \nbeing more effective than others. Maintainers not only need to learn what these options \nare, but also have to decide which are worthwhile applying in their own organizations. If \nthey make the right choices, it is possible to improve a system\u2019s performance and \nsimultaneously contain or even reduce the cost of maintenance. If they make wrong \nchoices, new problems arise while existing problems get worse. So the mission statement \nshould stress the need to make the most cost\u2013effective choices from the full array of \noptions. \n \nFailure can affect output, safety, environmental integrity, product quality, customer \nservice, protection and operating cost in addition to incurring repair costs. The severity \nand frequency with which a failure occurs make these consequences dictate the type of \nfailure-management technique that is worthwhile applying. So the mission statement \nshould acknowledge the key role of consequence avoidance on the maintenance \nprocedures employed. The most effective maintainers are those who apply the required \navailable resource \u2013 people, spares and tools \u2013 at minimum cost, but not so cheaply as to \nreduce the long-term functionality of their system. In other words, the lifetime cost of \nownership must be minimized. \n 9 \n \nFinally, the mission statement must recognize that maintenance depends on people \nincluding designers, constructors and operators. Everyone involved should share a \ncommon and correct understanding of what needs to be done, and to be able and willing \nto do whatever is required right first-time, every time. Hence the mission statement \nshould emphasise;  \n\u0001 Preserving the function of the physical system throughout its useful life. \n\u0001 Satisfying the system\u2019s owners and users, as well as ensuring the safety of the \nsociety. \n\u0001 Selecting and applying the most cost\u2013effective techniques for managing the \nconsequences of failure \n\u0001 The active support of all the personnel involved \n \nMAINTENANCE STRATEGY \n \nIt is usually far more difficult to develop and implement a strategy that enables the \nmaintenance enterprise to accomplish a mission than to devise that mission. There arise \nsuch questions as Where do we start? Do we buy a new maintenance-management \nprocess (MMP)? Reorganize? Invest in condition-monitoring equipment? Pull down the \nwhole system and rebuild? The answers lie at the beginning of the mission statement, i.e. \nto preserve the functions of our equipment. It is only when these functions have been \ndefined that it becomes clear what maintenance is trying to achieve and so what is meant \nby \u2018\u2019failed\u2019\u2019 or \u201cfailure\u201d. \n \nOnce the failure causes or failure modes and their effects have been identified, we are in \na position to asses how and which matter: this, in turn, enables us to determine which of \nthe full array of failure-management options should be used. This is termed work \nidentification [16]. When the maintenance requirements have been identified in detail, the \nnext step is to decide what resources (people, tools, energy, materials, etc) are needed to \nundertake each task. Then the following questions should be answered:- \n\u0001 Who is to undertake each task? A multi-skilled maintainer? The operator? A \ncontractor? The training department (if it exists)? The engineering department \n(if the equipment has to be redesigned)? \n\u0001 What spares and tools (including condition-monitoring equipment) are needed \nto complete each task? \nIt is only when the resource requirements are fully understood that we can decide exactly \nwhat is needed to manage the resources in such a way that the tasks are completed \neffectively. Looking at the maintenance requirement, in the context of the function of \neach system (by seeking to understand what it does), transforms the way in which the \nrequirements are perceived. \nThe development and execution of a strategy consists of three steps:- \n\u0001 Formulate a maintenance programme for each component (i.e. work \nidentification). \n 10 \n\u0001 Acquire the resources (i.e. skilled personnel, spares and tools) needed to execute \nthe procedure effectively  \n\u0001 Execute the campaign (i.e. acquire, deploy and operate the systems needed to \nmanage the resources effectively). \nFailure-Management Policies \nThese fall into two categories: \n\u2022 Proactive tasks: these are undertaken soon before a failure is likely to occur, in \norder to prevent the component from failing. Subdivisions of these tasks \ninclude scheduled restoration, scheduled discord and on- condition \nmaintenance. \n\u2022 Default actions: these, e.g. failure- finding redesign and run-to-failure, deal \nwith the failed state and are chosen when it is not possible to identify an \neffective proactive task. \nPlanning the project requires that clear objectives are established, a detailed plan \ncomposed and adequate resources allocated. Preparation entails everyone in the \norganization clearly understanding what the feasible maintenance acts can or cannot \nachieve and what must be done. Selecting the appropriate materials requires \nsystematically defining the function and required performance standard of each \ncomponent, deciding what failures are reasonably likely to occur, assessing the effects \nand consequences of each failure, and selecting a failure-management policy that deals \nappropriately with the consequences. \nRELIABILITY-CENTRED MAINTENANCE (RCM) \nThis is defined as a process used to determine what must be done to ensure that any \nphysical component continues to do whatever it was designed to do under the existing \ncircumstances. It entails asking questions about the asset under review, namely:- \n\u2022 What are the functions and associated performance standards required of the \ncomponent? \n\u2022 In what ways does the component fail to fulfil its functions? \n\u2022 What causes the functional failure? \n\u2022 In what way does each failure matter? \n\u2022 What can be done to predict or prevent each failure? \n\u2022 What happens if a suitable proactive remedial procedure cannot be found? \n \n 11 \nFunctions and performance standards \nIt is only when the function of each component has been defined that it becomes clearer \nas to what the maintenance process is trying to achieve, and also precisely what is meant \nby \u2018failed\u2019. Thus the first step in the RCM process is to define the function of each \ncomponent, together with the associated required standard of performance. The user of \nthe asset is usually well placed to know exactly what contribution each component makes \nto the physical and financial well-being of the organization as a whole, so it is essential \nthat the users are involved in the RCM process from the outset. \nFunctional failures \nThe objectives of the maintenance process are governed by the desired functions and \nassociated performance-expectations of the system. But how does the maintenance \nachieve these objectives? \nFailure is likely to stop any system performing to the standard required by its user. \nHowever before RCM procedures can be applied, a suitable blend of failure-management \ntools is needed to identify which failures are likely to occur. This is achieved by:- \n\u2022 specifying what circumstances amount to a failed state \n\u2022 asking what caused the asset to deteriorate to that failed state? \nFailed states (i.e. operational failures) occur when the system is unable to fulfil its \nfunction to a standard of performance which is acceptable to the user. This definition \nencompasses partial failures, where the system still functions but at an unacceptable level \nof performance. \nFailures \nLikely failures include those that (i) have occurred with the same or similar equipment \noperating under similar conditions, (ii) are currently being prevented by existing \nmaintenance schedules and (iii) have not yet happened but are considered to be real \npossibilities in the context in question. \nMost traditional failures include those caused by (i) deterioration or normal wear-and-\ntear, (ii) human error (on the part of operator or maintainer), and (iii) flaws in the design \nof the system. These probable causes of equipment failure can be identified and dealt \nwith appropriately. It is important to identify the cause of each failure in sufficient detail \nfor a suitable failure-management policy to be devised. \nFailure effects \nThe next step in the RCM process entails listing failure consequences, which describe \nwhat is likely to happen when each failure occurs. In order to support an evaluation of the \nfailure outcomes, these descriptions should include all the pertinent information, such as: \n 12 \n\u2022 What evidence (if any) is there that the failure has occurred? \n\u2022  In what ways (if any) does this failure pose a threat to safety of individuals or \nthe environment? \n\u2022 In what ways (if any) does the failure affect production or the operation of the \nplant\/equipment? \n\u2022 What physical damage (if any) is, or could be, caused by the failure? \n\u2022 What must be done to repair the faulty component? \nFailure consequence \nA detailed analysis of an average medium-sized industrial undertaking is likely to yield \nbetween three and ten thousand possible failure possibilities. Each of these affects the \norganization, but in each case, the consequences are probably different. The RCM \nprocess classifies failure consequences into four groups as follows: \n\u2022 Hidden failures expose the organization to serious consequences. \n\u2022 A failure has an operational consequence if it affects production (i.e. output, \nproduct quality, customer service or operating costs in addition to the direct \ncost of repairs). \n\u2022 A failure has a safety consequence if it results in hurting or killing somebody. \nIt has an environmental consequence if it breaches a corporate, regional, \nnational or international environmental standard. \n\u2022 Non\u2013operational consequence: evident failures that fall into this category \naffect neither safety nor operations, so they involve only the direct cost of the \nrepair \nThe RCM process uses these categories as the basis for devising a strategic framework \nfor maintenance decision-making. By imposing a structural view of the consequences of \neach failure, it focuses attention on the maintenance activities which have greater effects \non the performance of the organization and diverts energy being expended away from \nthose that have little or no effect (or which may even be counterproductive). It also \nencourages the user to think more broadly about innovative ways of managing failure \nrather than to concentrate solely on failure prevention. \nRESTORATION OR REJECTION \nScheduled restoration entails remanufacturing a component or overhauling an assembly \nat, or before, a specified age regardless of its condition at the time. Analogously, a \nscheduled discard entails rejecting an item at, or before, a specified life-limit regardless \nof its condition at the time. Collectively, these two types of tasks are now generally \nknown as preventive (or proactive) maintenance (PM). \n 13 \nOn\u2013condition techniques \nThese rely on the fact that most failures give prior warning that a fault is about to occur \n(e.g. a component\u2019s temperature rises excessively and can be detected by thermography). \nThen action can be taken to reduce or eliminate the consequences that could occur if \nfurther degeneration into functional failure would ensue. This category of tasks includes \nall types of PM condition-based maintenance and condition-monitoring. \nFailure\u2013finding \nThis entails checking hidden functions to find out whether they have failed (as opposed to \nthe on-condition task) which entails checking if something is failing. \nNo scheduled maintenance \nThis involves making no effort to anticipate or prevent failure modes, and so these \nfailures are simply allowed to occur, and then the system is repaired. This default is also \ncalled a run-to-failure (RTF). \nRedesign \nThis entails making an alteration to the structure of the system and possibly to the way it \nis used: it may require changes to hardware, procedures and, if necessary, training. \nRCM TASK-SELECTION  \nThis requires a highly-structured evaluation and policy-selection algorithm for each \nfailure mode. It incorporates precise and easily understood criteria for deciding which ( if \nany) of the proactive tasks is technically feasibly in the present context, and also deciding \nhow often and by whom the actions should be undertaken. It incorporates criteria for \ndeciding whether any task is worth doing, a decision that is governed by how well the \nalgorithm deals with the consequences of the failure. Finally, if a proactive action cannot \nbe identified that is both technically feasible and worth doing, the algorithm should lead \nthe user to the most suitable default action for dealing with the failure. \nThis approach means that proactive tasks are only specified for appropriate failures, \nwhich thereby leads to substantial diminution in routine workloads. If RCM is correctly \napplied to existing maintenance programmes, it reduces the amount of routine work (in \nother words, tasks to be done on a cyclic basis) in each period, usually by 40 to 70%. If \nRCM is used to develop a new maintenance programme, the resulting scheduled \nworkload should be much less than if the programme is developed by traditional \nmethods. Less routine work also means that the remaining tasks are more likely to be \ndone more thoroughly. This, together with the elimination of counter-productive tasks, \nleads to more effective maintenance. \n \n \n 14 \nPlanning \nThe successful application of a RCM procedure depends foremost on meticulous \nplanning and preparation. The key elements of the planning process are as follows: \n\u2022 Define the scope and boundaries of each project \n\u2022 Define, and whenever possible quantify, the objectives of each project (i.e. \ndescribe  the end-state required) \n\u2022 Estimate the period (e.g. for the necessary number of meetings) needed to review \nthe equipment for each productive process. \n\u2022 Identify the project manager and required facilities. \n\u2022 Identify participants (by title and by name) in the maintenance activity. \n\u2022 Plan the desirable training for participants and facilitators. \n\u2022 Plan the management audits associated with the RCM recommendations. \n\u2022 Plan the implementation of the recommendations (i.e. maintenance tasks, design \nchanges, and modifications to the operating procedures). \nREVIEW GROUPS \nMaintenance practices embody the definitions of tasks, functions and missions. A review \nof the maintenance requirements of any system can be undertaken by small teams, which \nshould include the system\u2019s designers, operators and maintainers. The undertaking of this \nsearch and analysis must have the full support of the management and adequate \nresources. The seniority of each group member is less important than the fact that he\/she \nshould have a thorough knowledge of the system under review, i.e. have been trained in \nmaintenance functions.  \nAudit  \nOnce the maintenance review has been completed for each system, senior mangers with \noverall responsibility for the equipment must satisfy themselves that the review is \nthorough, sensible and defensible. This entails deciding whether they agree with the \ndefinitions of function, mission and performance standard required of the considered \nsystem. The identification of failure modes and the description of failures affect the \nassessment of failure consequences and the selection of remedial tasks.  \nImplementation \nOnce the maintenance review has been audited and approved, the final step is to perform \nthe agreed changes, tasks and procedures. These must be communicated in a way, which \nensures that they will be clearly understood and performed safely by the personnel to \n 15 \nwhom they are allocated. The maintenance tasks are then fed into suitable high \u2013 and \nlow-frequency maintenance planning and control procedures, while revised operating \nprocedures are incorporated into standard operating manuals.  \nPlanned PM \nThis involves the repair, replacement, and maintenance of equipment in order to avoid \nunexpected failures during use. The primary objective of planned PM is the minimization \nof the total cost (measured as the cost of production or product quality) of inspection, \nrepair and equipment downtime. It provides a critical service function, without which \nmajor business interruptions could take place. The other component is unplanned (i.e. \nunexpected) maintenance [3]. Planned maintenance can be time-based or condition-based \n[17]. \nThrough continuous improvement, lean manufacturing and lean maintenance one is able \nto target the identification and elimination of waste of resources. The problem of under-\nmaintaining an asset is often addressed through loss-elimination and continual-\nimprovement programmes. The problem of over-maintaining, by comparison, receives \nrelatively little attention. Left unattended, the over-maintaining of systems continues to \nincrease maintenance costs and squander scarce maintenance resources. Industries in \nNigeria have been lax in their approaches to setting PM intervals: for instance \n\u2022 a high percentage of PM costs are incurred on activities with a frequency of 30 \ndays or less. \n\u2022 30 to 40 percent of PM costs are spent on systems with negligible failures. \nCHANGING WORLD OF MAINTENANCE \nRecently, the importance of proper maintenance has changed significantly due to huge \nincreases in the number and variety of plants, equipment and buildings, which need to be \nmaintained. Some of these systems are now of highly-complex design. New maintenance \ntechniques and modern views on maintenance organization and responsibilities have \nevolved [16]. Maintenance workers have had to adapt to new ways of thinking and \nsometimes act as engineers and managers. Simultaneously, the limitations of maintenance \nsystems are becoming increasing apparent, no matter how much they are computerized! \nThese numerous trends have made managers everywhere look for new approaches to \nmaintenance. They want to avoid the false starts and dead ends, which always accompany \nmajor upheavals. Instead, they seek a strategy framework which synthesises the new \ndevelopments into a coherent protocol, so that they can evaluate them sensibly and apply \nthose likely to be of significant value to them and their companies [7]. \nResearch \nApart from growing operational expectations, research is changing our understanding \nabout the working lives of components and associated failures. In particular, it has \nbecome apparent that there is less and less connection between the operating age of an \n 16 \nasset and how likely it is to fail. A growing awareness of \u201cinfant mortality\u201d has led to the \nwidespread belief in the upturned \u2018bathtub\u2019 curves of a component\u2019s effectiveness versus \noperational duration.  \nNew Techniques \nThere has been explosive growth in new maintenance concepts and techniques. The \ndevelopments [16] include: \n\u2022 Decision-support tools, such as hazard-studies, failure modes and effects analyses \n(FMEAs) and expert systems \n\u2022 New maintenance techniques, such as condition monitoring \n\u2022 Designing equipment with a much greater emphasis on reliability and ease of \nmaintainability \n\u2022 A major shift in organizational thinking towards participation, team working and \nflexibility. \nChallenges Facing Maintenance Personnel \nThese nowadays are not only to learn what the new techniques are, but to decide which \nare worthwhile implementing in their own organizations. The challenges facing modern \nmaintenance mangers include [7]: \n\u2022 Selecting the most appropriate techniques to deal with each type of failure in \norder to fulfil all the expectations of the owners and users of the assets, as well as \nsociety as a whole \n\u2022 Implementing the measures in the most cost-effective and enduring fashion \n\u2022 Achieving the active support and co-operation of all the personnel involved. \nCONCLUSIONS \nAs unit fossil-fuel costs rise, effective maintenance procedures have become more \nimportant in industry in order to reduce energy expenditure and so raise profits. \nMaintenance efficiency can affect plant availability, costs, business effectiveness and \nrisk, safety, environmental integrity, energy efficiency, product quality and customer \nservice. Because of the complexity of current equipment, repairing and restoration are \nmore difficult and special multi-skill new tools and techniques are needed. Also \ndowntime becomes more apparent and embarrassing: so in a bid to find ways of \npreventing failure, the concept of PM resulted. Also, as maintenance costs have risen \nsharply relative to other operating costs, maintenance planning and control systems have \nattracted far greater interest. \n 17 \nFocus is not only concentrated on availability but also on the related concept of \nreliability. Improved maintenance procedures such as RCM, TPM, RCFA, and FMEA \nhave been applied to achieve maintenance objectives: the focus is now shifting to \nhighlight those aspects where the inherent design of the system yields probabilities of \nfailure that are unacceptable and so provide some guidance and motivation for improving \nthe effectiveness of the system. \nThe challenges facing maintenance managers today are not in finding methodologies and \napproaches to apply, but in understanding how they coalesce with one another. The \napproach has to be to internalize best practice within the organization, and simply \nbecome the universally accepted as the \u201cway we do things around here\u201d  \nPM activities are primarily condition\u2013based. The condition of a component measured \nwhen the equipment is in operation, should govern its planned and scheduled corrective \nmaintenance (CM). A standard CM procedure should be developed and documented. \nThis should define the need for CM as part of PM. \nREFERENCES \n1. Campbell, J.D. And Jardine, A.K.S.
