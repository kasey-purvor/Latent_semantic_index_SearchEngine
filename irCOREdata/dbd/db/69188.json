Cronin \n\u201cGender in the Making of Commercial Worlds: Creativity, Vitalism and the Practices of \nMarketing\u201d, Feminist Theory, 9 (3): 293-312. \n \n \nAbstract \nIf capitalism is being increasingly understood as performative and processual, and if these \nunderstandings are being folded into capitalism\u2019s production of itself, what place does gender \nhave in performing the commercial world? This article argues that the significance of gender \nas genre or type has been overlooked in the recent literature on the performance of the market \nor market relations. While the role of economic theories and management practices in making \nmarkets has been examined, and the place of women in organisations has been explored, little \nattention has been paid to how gender as a productive process marks the creation and \nmaintenance of market relations. Using material from a recent ethnographic study of the \nadvertising industry, I examine how advertising practitioners incorporate vitalist \nunderstandings of market relations and of knowledge-producing activities into their practices. \nFramed as \u2018creativity\u2019 and \u2018innovation\u2019, these discursive practices perform what practitioners \nunderstand as a reproductive function in commercial life. \n \nKeywords \ncapitalism; commercial autogenesis; reproduction; vitalism; creativity; innovation; market; \nadvertising \n \n \nIn feminist work, there has been a long-established concern with analysing the relationship \nbetween sexual reproduction and social reproduction, for instance in understandings of the \nheterosexual nuclear family as an economic unit of production (and today more as a unit of \nconsumption) (e.g. Hennessy 2000). Such analyses centre on a framing of gender as a form of \nmaking or as a technology (de Lauretis 1989), and most influential in this area has been \nDonna Haraway\u2019s work. She argues that gender can be considered a \u2018grammar\u2019 which \narticulates with other differences (Haraway 1991: 147). Here, gender as kind or type \nperforms; it makes and remakes relationships across a range of bodies, objects, signs, and \nmaterialities. These relationships are often commercial in that the proprietory \u2018marks\u2019 of \ncapital (brands, trademarks) function both to denaturalise kind and type (including gender), \nand also to renaturalise those brands and trademarks through their attachment to reproduction \nand new forms of life such as the trademarked OncoMouse. This is a relationship in which \ncapital\u2019s \u2018syntactical\u2019 marks of \u00a9 and \u2122 signal \u2018the syntax of natural\/social\/technical \nrelationships congealed into property\u2019 in which brand names act as genders, \u2018that is, generic \nmarks that are directional signals on maps of power and knowledge\u2019 (Haraway 1997: 7, 8). As \nFranklin, Lury and Stacey (2000) have demonstrated, gender as type or grammar performs \nacross a range of sites including the local and global, life itself, and materialities such as \ncommodities. \n But while brand names and commodities as genders work upon the discursive fabric \nof contemporary life in striking and protean ways, gender as type, kind and process also \nperforms other complex commercial relationships. This work of gender has been central \u2013 if \nunacknowledged \u2013 in Foucault\u2019s analysis of a \u2018bio-politics of the population\u2019 (Foucault 1990: \n139). While Foucault famously paid scant attention to gender, his conceptualisation of the \nnew discursive framing of people into \u2018populations\u2019 was premised upon the ideal of the \nreproduction of the social or collective body tied to physical reproduction. Power, he argued, \n 1\n\u2018is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale \nphenomenon of population\u2019 (Foucault: 1990: 137). In turn, understandings of people-as-\npopulations were reliant upon ways of classifying and manipulating the resulting data (Rose \n1999). These modes of representing human life (statistics, taxonomies, metrics) offered new \nmeans of governance, potentially rendering people as populations more calculable and \namenable to subjection (and, indeed, also offered new modes of subjectification). These \nmeans of classification formed a kind of grammar which had the capacity to organise. As \nBowker and Star argue, \u2018a \u201cclassification system\u201d is a set of boxes (metaphorical or literal) \ninto which things can be put to then do some kind of work \u2013 bureaucratic or knowledge \nproduction\u2019 (2000: 10). In marketing practices, the classifying processes pivot around myriad \nconceptualisations of people as (a population of) consumers. But whether in marketing or in \nbureaucratic processes, genre and type play a central role, tied as they are to gender as a \nfundamental understanding of the (sexual) reproduction of the (social) body. In the \ndissemination of means of governance through taxonomy and ideas of population, gender as \ngrammatical or syntactical plays a significant role in the division and ordering of the \ncontemporary world. This idea of life and power has been most intensively examined by \nfeminists in the area of health, science and technology, and there has been far less attention \npaid to how gender as genre or kind helps shape the processual or performative character of \nthe commercial and organisational world. \nThis analysis of \u2018life\u2019 in all its forms has recently taken a new focus with debates on \nvitalism (Fraser, Kember & Lury 2005; Kanamori 2005; Lash 2006)1. Here, capitalism is \nunderstood as performative, experimental, adaptive and organised around innovation or \n\u2018planful opportunism\u2019 (Thrift 2005: 9). Capitalism as \u2018a vital intensity\u2019 is thought to engineer \nnew forms of governance through novel means such as organising affective responses (Thrift \n                                                 \n1 See also special issue of Theory, Culture and Society, 2007, 24 (6). \n 2\n2005: 16). Alongside a Deleuzian emphasis on becoming, frameworks such as complexity \ntheory analyse \u2018complex (\u201cvital\u201d) matter\u2019 (Urry 2005: 1). Such systems are often seen as \nautopoietic or self-generative, demonstrating adaptive features as they self-organise through \ntime. Analyses of such systems emphasize \u2018a sense of contingent openness and multiple \nfutures, of the unpredictability of outcomes in time-space\u2019 (Urry 2005: 3).  \nIn parallel to this interest in process and autopoiesis, recent debates on commerce take \nas their starting point an understanding that markets are performed. Markets are not seen as \ngiven structures within which commercial practices take place; markets are understood as \nperformative, made and remade by practitioners\u2019 actions (Callon 1998; MacKenzie 2006; \nMacKenzie and Millo 2003; MacKenzie, Muniesa & Siu 2007). They are processual and the \nperformances that constitute them are often organised through flows or exchanges of \nknowledge (Knorr Cetina & Bruegger 2002a). Such studies challenge conventional economic \nmodels of processes and structures such as price mechanisms by highlighting their \nperformative and contingent production and by integrating an analysis of the interaction of \nthings and people (Knorr Cetina and Preda 2005; Law 2002). Many of these debates focus on \nthe performance of markets in economics and the financial industries.2 They take as a \nparticular concern \u2018how \u201cabstract\u201d or \u201cvirtual\u201d assets are brought into being and made \ntradable\u2019 (MacKenzie 2007: 357). But the insights of such analyses can be usefully imported \ninto other areas of study such as marketing. Thrift (2005) notes that one key feature of \ncontemporary society is a feedback loop in which capitalism processes understandings of \nitself, understandings such as those developed in management theories and in consultancy \nfirms. For Thrift, the development of business schools, management consultants, management \ngurus and the media constitutes the \u2018cultural circuit\u2019 of capitalism (Thrift 2005: 6). This is a \n                                                 \n2 See special issue of Economy and Society, 2007, 36 (3). \n 3\nform of knowledge economy with a driving emphasis on innovation, adaptability and \ncreativity. It is a form of capitalism that has been,  \n \nconjured into existence by the discursive apparatus of the cultural circuit of capital \nwhich, through the continuous production of propositional and prescriptive knowledge, \nhas the power to make its theories and descriptions of the world come alive in new built \nform, new machines and new bodies. \n(Thrift 2005: 11) \n \nThe knowledges that the world of capitalism produces about itself form a recursive, self-\ngenerative network. For example, MacKenzie and Millo (2003) demonstrate how option \npricing theory operates performatively, albeit in ways that are contested and could not be \nconsidered to constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy. In their study, derivatives markets \ngradually altered to fit an emerging theoretical economic model and even participants who \nwere unconvinced by the model were forced to adopt it as more and more participants came to \norient their practices around it.  \nBut in this literature on the performance of markets there is almost no focus on \nmarketing, either as a practical discipline in which most firms engage internally or as a \nspecialist knowledge service which clients buy into (although see Cochoy 1999). Equally \nstriking is the lack of attention paid to the role of social difference in the performance of \ncapitalist knowledge networks or the work of gender as genre or type in processes of \ntaxonomising. My recent study of the outdoor advertising industry in the UK attempts to offer \na corrective to this and open up debates in this area.3 \n                                                 \n3 The research was supported by ESRC grant number RES 000221744. The project involved 28 in-depth \ninterviews of 45-90 minutes with practitioners in a range of London-based media owning companies, media \nagencies, specialist poster agencies, trade associations, research companies and one client company. In addition, \n 4\nOutdoor or \u2018out of home\u2019 advertising is a sub-field of the general advertising industry \nwhich is dominated by broadcast advertising such as television and, increasingly, internet \nadvertising. The outdoor sector trades in space, offering to potential advertisers segments of \ntime on sites such as roadside billboards, panels in pedestrian zones, train and underground \ntrains and buses. Media owners such as J.C.Decaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, CBS Outdoor \n(formerly Viacom), Titan and Primesight own and maintain these poster sites and have \ncontracts with local councils whereby they construct and maintain bus shelters or other \namenities in return for the right to sell advertising space on them. They sell advertising to \nclients via the intermediaries of media agencies or specialist poster companies. To facilitate \nthis task, and to compete with rival companies with similar portfolios of advertising sites, the \nmedia owners commission market research companies to produce data on their sites and on \npotential \u2018target markets\u2019 who will be \u2018hit\u2019 by advertising on those sites. \n In the terms of this analysis, then, \u2018the market\u2019 is constituted by multiple elements: the \nclients that the media owners or media agencies are pitching to; \u2018the consumers\u2019 on the street \nwho are the \u2018target markets\u2019 for outdoor advertising; and the sets of relationships between \nmedia owners, media agencies and client firms. The industry is constituted by a set of \ncarefully maintained commercial relationships and is framed by various forms of calculative \nand promotional action. Central to these relationships is the generation and circulation of \n                                                                                                                                                        \ndata such as briefs, research questionnaires, research project results and PowerPoint presentations was collected \nfrom these companies. The project also involved a two-week ethnography in 2006 with one media owner \nincluding observation of directors\u2019 meetings, brainstorming and creative sessions, construction and presentations \nof pitches, visits to clients and media agencies, staff training, and a range of in-depth interviews with staff. Other \nparts of the project involved a case study of the visual impact of outdoor advertising in Manchester. A more \ndetailed discussion of the empirical data appears elsewhere (Cronin 2008, Cronin forthcoming). This article \nfocuses on one element that emerged from the study \u2013 creativity and its articulation in the industry as vital and \nautogenic. While there was ample evidence in my study of this phenomenon, and vitalist commercial \nunderstandings have been identified by other studies (e.g. Hassoun 2005; Knorr Cetina & Bruegger 2002a), it is \nimportant to stress that this characteristic is but one of a range of commercial articulations, and may not \nnecessarily be present in all commercial sectors. \n \n 5\nvarious types of marketing data. The media owners engage in a continual process of creating \n\u2018pitches\u2019 in PowerPoint presentation form, trading on claims about their ability to produce \n\u2018expert knowledges\u2019 of consumers and advertising sites. These pitches are presented to \nrepresentatives of media agencies or specialist poster agencies and aim to persuade these \nintermediaries that the outdoor medium is appropriate for their clients\u2019 needs and that a media \nowner\u2019s sites \u2013 such as in train stations or on bus shelters \u2013 are most appropriate to target a \nparticular audience. Media agencies then selectively reconstruct the media owners\u2019 \nPowerPoint presentations, cutting and pasting data from a range of sources, and use them to \npitch to potential clients. Within these relations, there is a tension evident between the need \nfor market stability in which market relationships ideally cohere in a recognisable format \nacross time (achieved by a certain predictability in the framing of commercial relationships \nbetween media owners, media agencies and clients) and a requirement for innovation in order \nto secure competitive advantage (and ensure the continued profitable existence of the firm). In \norienting themselves to these duals goals, companies perform both these markets relations \nand a set of conceptualisations of \u2018consumers\u2019 and consumption practices. \n \n \n\u2018Working knowledges\u2019 of gender \n \nIn my study, knowledge practices \u2013 particularly those involving the classification and \nreclassification of consumers \u2013 were central to the everyday working patterns and acted to \nstructure relationships between media owners, media agencies and clients. Gender played a \nkey role in these practices in several inter-related ways. Firstly, I found that as claims to \nknowledge and practices of knowledge exchange are central to this industry, typologies such \nas \u2018female consumers\u2019 \u2013 the group most strongly associated with consumption and purchasing \n 6\ndecisions \u2013 were centrally important. Secondly, these taxonomic practices are used as \n\u2018commercial experiments\u2019 in order to make and maintain commercial relations between the \ndifferent economic actors in the field. As noted above, markets are performed; they involve a \nset of practices that act to constitute market relations and the knowledge practices around \ngender act to stitch these relations together (albeit in provisional and shifting ways). And \nthirdly, gender as type or genre of process is key for generating new classifications and \nproducing new knowledges that are used as promotional leverage or \u2018point of difference\u2019 as \nvarious companies compete for business. This gendered processual form of knowledge \nproduction is then woven into the performance of market relationships between media \nowners, media agencies and clients. As I argue in later sections, such a production of \nclassifications is a form of commercial reproduction framed by the industry as market \ninnovation. This form of reproduction is seen by practitioners as commercial survival through \ncompetition. These three sets of practices combine to perform market relations within the \noutdoor advertising industry. \nAs part of these knowledge practices, consumers are \u2018made up\u2019. Indeed, the figure of \nthe consumer, itself segmented into minutely differentiated social classifications, is a \nrelatively recent invention which was created by commercial enterprises in the nineteenth \ncentury as a means of generating stability and predictability for the market which was plagued \nby vagaries (Cochoy 1999, 2002). By making people \u2018knowable\u2019 and calculable in such \ntaxonomies, models of consumer identity offered new modes of subjectification in a culture \nintensely oriented around consumption (Miller & Rose 1997). In effect, the very \nconceptualisation of the customer who might buy a product, and the typologies of the \nconsumer that were then generated, acted to perform and maintain certain market relations \u2013 \nrelations which sought to ensure the stability of profit-making relationships (Cochoy 2002). In \nmarketing practices (and indeed in academic marketing analyses) gender is one of the most \n 7\ncommon \u2018segmentation variables\u2019 used in surveys (Catterall, Maclaran & Stevens 2000: 6). \nBut on a more fundamental level, the generic typology of \u2018the consumer\u2019 is widely assumed \nto be female (ibid.). This strong association of the consumer with women is well represented \nin academic studies of the development of consumer society (Bowlby 1993; Nava 1991; \nRappaport 2000) and in ethnographic studies of contemporary consumption practices (e.g. \nMiller 1998). But there are tensions within marketing practices about this generic view of the \nconsumer and those firms\u2019 claims about their ability to identify and target very specific \ndemographics or niche markets. This is nowhere more evident than in the outdoor advertising \nsector which, due to the nature of its sites, has the potential to reach a very wide range of \n\u2018target markets\u2019. In its self-promotional activities, the industry attempts to present this \ncharacteristic as an advantage, emphasising that outdoor advertising is one of the few \u2018mass \nmedia\u2019 left in an age of intense media segmentation. As one practitioner described to me, \noutdoor is \u2018one is the last broadcast channels\u2019 which can reach \u201850\/60% of the population \nwithin 2 weeks\u2019. But at the same time, the industry offers various highly specific modes of \nclassifying consumers into very finely calibrated segmentations based on various social \nclassifications, consumption preferences, attitudes and activities. \nWithin this range of classificatory activities, the consumer segment of \u2018the housewife\u2019 \nis alive and well, although there is scepticism in the industry about this classification\u2019s \nconceptual coherence as well as pragmatic concerns about its traction with clients. There also \nexists a slight embarrassment about what practitioners realise must now be seen as an \noutmoded and perhaps offensive classification \u2013 \u2018I can\u2019t believe we still use that term\u2019. In a \npromotional pitch by one media agency on \u2018how to reach housewives with kids\u2019 it is claimed \nthat \u2018housewives with children are a gateway to a range of purchasing decisions\u2019. Part of their \nPowerPoint pitch claims that:  \n \n 8\n\u2022 H\/wives with children travel around but not very far afield \n\u2022 Appear to be seduced by immediate call to action, especially relating to their children \n\u2022 Recognise the importance of OOH [out-of-home] advertising to tell them about new \nproducts and offers \n\u2022 Respond to \u2018price\u2019 advertising for themselves and their children \n \nDespite the range of existing taxonomic marketing tools, and hence the scope of \nsegmentations available to practitioners, it is not surprising that there remains a strong focus \non the figure of \u2018the housewife\u2019 (although these claims now include qualifications about a \nshift from life-long status to lifestage and career trajectory, career breaks and part-time work). \nIf, as Foucault (1990) argued, power is exercised at the level of defining and managing \n\u2018populations\u2019, gender and sexual reproduction must be seen as central to these processes. \nMarketing\u2019s classifications of consumers and attempted commercial management of market \nrelations can be seen as part of this power\u2013knowledge project in which the heterosexual \nnuclear family is (still) seen as the key site of social reproduction and an important force \nwithin economic life, particularly in terms of consumption. Gender is thus central to such \nclassificatory projects although in my study, \u2018the housewife\u2019 was presented less as a \ndeterminate social status than an aggregate of practices: what women with children do and \nhow they do it. Gender is thus characterised by a set of practices that shift according to market \npragmatics (new products launched, perceived shifts in consumption patterns, new \ncompetitors). It is not that bodies marked by gender, age, ethnicity or other social status have \nno place in the world of marketing knowledges, but rather that they are not the starting points \nfor those knowledge practices \u2013 the marketers start from people\u2019s perceived practices (or \nmore precisely, what they can know about these practices) and selectively produce \nknowledges that are transferable and malleable for their specific purposes. \n 9\nFor obvious commercial reasons, the practices that form the focus of classificatory \nactivities tend to be consumption-oriented. For example, media owners may commission \nresearch or interpretations of wider research projects that examine how people commute to \nwork and what they do whilst travelling. One specialist media planning company, for \ninstance, engaged in a research project in which women with children were given a camera, \nasked to photograph their activities on a typical day and then annotate the photographs. The \nresults were selectively used in that company\u2019s promotional materials to emphasise how much \ntime women spent driving their children to school and going to the supermarket, and thus how \nmany times women were exposed to outdoor and \u2018point of sale\u2019 advertising sites. This time \nwas then segmented into various typologies that appeared most commercially saleable such as \n\u2018golden time\u2019 or time just for themselves \u2013 moments of relaxation when women might be \nmost receptive to advertising messages about leisure products such as magazines. \n Gender is of course only one variable that is tracked and only one classification that is \nhighlighted in the industry\u2019s promotional pitches. In addition to commissioned research \nprojects, practitioners use a range of standard marketing databases such as TGI which \ncorrelate acts of purchase with a vast range of typologies such as age, sex, ethnicity \noccupation and with other consumption patterns, for example the purchase of a certain brand \nof car with how many foreign holidays that consumer may take a year. They then bring these \nrather abstract classificatory aggregates to life in PowerPoint presentations with vox pop \u2013\nhighly selective video clips of research subjects articulating saleable soundbites or what they \ncall \u2018nuggets\u2019. This is a strategic and contingent process. One practitioner described the \nprocess of researching for a PowerPoint pitch in which he would use standard industry \ndatabases but would also require a nugget or interesting \u2018hook\u2019 or angle to make the pitch \nappear convincingly attuned to the zeitgeist:  \u2018if you want a real nugget you still have to go \nback on to Google and type in \u201chousewife.pdf\u201d and random research things to try and find \n 10\nthat nugget\u2019. These diverse knowledge production processes generate a set of shifting \nunderstandings that is used by media owners as promotional pitches. But the production of \nclassifications of gender based on women\u2019s consumption practices is only one way in which \ngender is significant in these market practices. \n \n \nInnovation, creativity and point of difference \n \nThe fact that all classifications are seen by practitioners as mutable, contingent, and \nstrategically-oriented, and that their manipulation and circulation is performative of these \nparticular market relationships, marks an important characteristic of this market \u2013 the \nperformance of its own \u2018life\u2019 or the reproduction of its viability as a profitable and relatively \nstable set of market relationships. As I will go on to argue, gender is framed not only as a \nclassification but also as a mode of classifying. As such a classifying device, gender is \nperformed here not just as kind or type (e.g. type of consumer) but as a process, a process of \nmaking difference and generating classifications and classificatory systems. Gender here \nperforms a commercially reproductive process. \nAs companies must compete for business in an industry based on knowledges of \nconsumers and expertise on how to target them using that companies\u2019 particular assets, the \nproduction of commercial \u2018point of difference\u2019 is crucial. The continual production of \nproprietary taxonomic systems, or new ways of understanding consumers, is thus a key \nstructuring element of the performance of these market relationships. On one level, this \nemphasis on change, creativity and innovation mirrors the rhythms of capitalist product \ninnovation. Thus, companies stress the significance of classifications such as \u2018early adopters\u2019 \n(people who first take up new products on the market such as fashions or technologies) and \n 11\n\u2018opinion formers\u2019 (seen as people who influence trends). Indeed, this stress on \u2018newness\u2019 and \ninnovation is stitched into the fabric of the industry on all levels. As one practitioner \ndescribed to me, the corporate \u2018memory\u2019 of the advertising industry is short as commercial \nincentives are focused on change and rebranding, not just of products but of media agencies\u2019 \nand media owners\u2019 claims about means to reach target markets. For instance, when he worked \nin television advertising 7 years previously, the ideal marketing \u2018conversation\u2019 with the \nconsumer was framed in terms of \u2018attentiveness\u2019 whereas it is currently being framed as \n\u2018engagement\u2019. It is not that one conceptualisation is more effective than another in targeting \nconsumers but that the industry\u2019s competitive nature requires constant innovation and \u2018re-\npackaging\u2019 of marketing approaches. This repackaging of very similar ideas often goes \nunnoticed because the average length of time a brand manager at a client firm will stay in that \nfairly junior position is very short. So the brand managers are \u2018looking at the next rung of the \nladder. They\u2019re not going to challenge [repackaged ideas or dubious claims made about data] \nbecause they\u2019ve only got to keep it together for 18 months, maybe less, and they\u2019ll be on the \nnext one\u2019. \nWithin this context of innovation, these strategic knowledge-producing activities are \nneither stable nor framed as long-term but are intended to perform convincingly into the \nmoment and maintain market relations. Elsewhere, I have argued that these knowledge \npractices can be understood as commercial experiments (Cronin forthcoming). Just as \nscientists have created worlds and regimes of truth through scientific experimentation \n(Haraway 1991, 1997), so too do commercial experiments create worlds \u2013 worlds made of \nmarket relationships. These experiments include developing and pitching new modes of \nclassifying consumers (using new database technologies or new qualitative data) which are \n\u2018tested\u2019 according to their level of commercial efficacy, that is, according to their \n 12\nfunctionality in persuading the media owner\u2019s immediate clients (often via media agencies) \nthat they should buy advertising space from them. \nThe commercial worlds that I saw created in the outdoor advertising industry centred \non innovation and creativity and it appears that these characteristics are becoming \nincreasingly significant in the practices of a wide range of other sectors. It has been noted that \ncorporate ideals and discursive practices within such organisations have long been oriented \ntowards an idea of the future (Munro 1998). Now studies have developed an intensified \ninterest in idea of \u2018the possible\u2019 or \u2018the potential\u2019. For instance Lazzarato (2004: 192), \ndrawing on the work of Gabriel Tarde, argues that the operation of firms today often centres \non \u2018the production of \u201cpossibles\u201d\u2019 with a focus on \u2018invention, the ability to organize, to \ncombine, to make happen\u2019. This involves a valuing of the ability to anticipate and \u2018demands \nlearning from uncertainty and mutations\u2019 (Lazzarato 2004: 192). There is seen to be an \nemphasis on people\u2019s potential ability (Sennett 2006), alongside a shift in managerial \nemphasis to the entrepreneurial, to the valuing of initiative and movement, and to forms of \nknowledge production that are \u2018flexible, proactive, and able to deal with uncertainty\u2019 \n(Hinchliffe 2000: 588). Within this shift to movement, futurity, and responsiveness in \nmanagement rhetoric and practice, \u2018history vanishes, with its implied effects and causes, as \nthe more mystical notion of \u201cChange\u201d steps in to replace it\u2019 (Wright cited in Hinchliffe 2000: \n580). \nThis stress on innovation and responsiveness may be perceived as new in some areas of \nmanagement and commercial practice, but it is long established in the advertising and \nmarketing sectors. In its practices of generating constantly evolving images, texts and \nassociations for brands and products, the advertising industry in particular is associated with \ncreativity (Nixon 2003). But within the sector of the industry I was analysing \u2013 traders of \nspace and practitioners of media sales \u2013 that creativity and innovation takes a rather different \n 13\nform. Change, and innovation as the creative management of that change, is central to the \npractices I observed and the ways in which respondents described their work.4 More broadly, \nthe conceptual paradigm of \u2018creation\u2019 and creativity \u2013 the capacity to engage effectively in \nsuch a process of generation or invention \u2013 is tied to the performance of \u2018possibles\u2019, of \npotential commercial futures. Studies have noted how practitioners can relate to the market in \nwhich they operate in what could be seen as vitalist ways. Knorr Cetina and Bruegger (2002a: \n164) argue that in their study of foreign exchange market traders the practices of \n\u2018exteriorization, assemblage and contextualization of \u201cthe market\u201d on screen\u2019 acts to construe \nthe market as an \u2018external \u201clife form\u201d\u2019. The traders talked about the market as a \u2018greater \nbeing\u2019 whilst engaging with \u2018it\u2019 cognitively and emotionally, variously inhabiting that \ncommercial world or reacting to it in an adversarial manner (2002a: 169). Hassoun\u2019s (2005: \n109, 112) study of traders also revealed such understandings where the traders described the \nmarket in human or animal terms - \u2018the market is jumpy\u2019, \u2018it was healthier\u2019 \u2013 and indeed, in \nsexual terms: to \u2018feel up\u2019 or \u2018stroke\u2019 the market, \u2018get the pussy\u2019, \u2018give the market a screw\u2019. \nIntertwining symbolic and material practices, the traders\u2019 modes of understanding the market \nframed and directed their commercial actions. This \u2018commercial vitalism\u2019 was also evident in \nmy study.5 While there are significant differences between financial market traders\u2019 practices \nand traders of space in the advertising industry (most notably the financial traders\u2019 \nengagement with \u2018the screen\u2019 as embodiment of the market), there are important resonances. \nIn my study, market relations are enacted as \u2018vital\u2019 by practitioners in three key ways.  \nFirstly, the market was framed in practitioners\u2019 accounts as unpredictable and difficult \nto manage. Outdoor advertising is generally recognised within the industry as a poor \u2018sales \n                                                 \n4 Indeed, it would be interesting to speculate about the relatively recent emphasis on innovation and \ncreativity observed in organisations\u2019 practices and rhetoric and whether this has been learnt from the long-\nestablished practices in the marketing and advertising sectors. \n \n5 I have developed the concept of \u2018commercial vitalism\u2019 more fully elsewhere (Cronin forthcoming). \n 14\ndriver\u2019, that is, not efficient at creating a positive impact on sales figures. Instead, it is \npromoted as a medium suitable for creating or maintaining \u2018brand awareness\u2019 or changing \npeople\u2019s perceptions about a brand. Due to its purportedly \u2018soft\u2019 role in persuasion, \npractitioners argue that, \u2018it\u2019s very difficult to track effectiveness of how outdoor is changing \npeople\u2019s perception in terms of bottom line sales\u2019 and that \u2018it\u2019s very difficult sometimes to \nisolate the effect of a particular medium within what it\u2019s doing overall to their bottom line \nsales\u2019. This ambiguous effect of advertising on sales is well-recognised within academic \nstudies (Miller 1997; Schudson 2003). Within the industry, this ambiguity is a key factor \nwhich shapes the particular character of the performance of market relations. As one \npractitioner put it, companies would like a calculative \u2018machine\u2019 into which they could input \nsales data and advertising spend and which would then produce verifiable, statistically sound \nanswers to their marketing queries. But the reality is that even complex modelling tools \ncannot separate out the variables sufficiently effectively to make such figures fully reliable for \ncommercial assessment and market prediction.  \nThe indeterminate impact of advertising on sales, combined with the highly competitive \narena in which media owners and media agencies operate, means that commercial practices \nare oriented towards producing good enough pitches of data or ways of understanding \nconsumers and advertising sites which practitioners describe as \u2018convincing\u2019 and \n\u2018compelling\u2019. Indeed, no belief in the validity of the marketing pitches is required, only an \nability to convince other actors in the field of the strategic short-term utility of the data in the \npitch. These are \u2018working knowledges\u2019 whose efficacy is defined by practitioners as a need \nwork into the moment. They need only to convince the next person in the chain of market \nrelationships of their immediate \u2018workability\u2019, and in a more future-oriented sense, of their \nability to create virtual consumers and ultimately facilitate the smooth operation of market \nrelations between media owners, media agencies and clients. As the direct effects of \n 15\nadvertising on sales \u2018up-lift\u2019 are recognised within the field as at best ambiguous, the onus on \nthese pitches\u2019 status as verifiably accurate is lifted. Clients respond to this unpredictability in \na range of ways, and media owners and media agencies must manage those responses. One \npractitioner describes how some clients selectively use research on advertising effects as \nbackup for their intuitive sense of their promotional activities while others experience the \nambiguity of the figures and the unpredictability of the commercial world as far more \nunsettling: \n \nSome clients are quite intuitive and they sort of sense \u2013 they sort of know \u2013 they know \nwhat\u2019s going on and they look for bits of evidence just to help support what they \nalready hold as a belief. Some clients are literally open-minded and don\u2019t know. For the \nopen-minded clients they probably have more anxiety about this because they think, \nshit, we still don\u2019t know so much of what\u2019s going on out there. \n \nThis vital unpredictability is thus seen by all parties as a commercial problem in one sense but \nit is also framed as an opportunity for the production of competitive \u2018point of difference\u2019 for \nthose who can manage it creatively. \n Secondly, the market was framed by practitioners as vital in how the relationships \nbetween media owners, media agencies and clients were seen as organic \u2013 as fragile and \ncontingent, and requiring constant maintenance. In what is seen as very much as \u2018person-to-\nperson industry\u2019, these relationships are key. For instance, I observed how one major media \nagency\u2019s offices were centred around a large well-lit space filled with tables and chairs in the \nstyle of a caf\u00e9. Representatives from media owners would regularly visit their contact person \nat the media agency in this meeting space where they would pitch their latest research project, \ndata or information about their new advertising sites. The media owner\u2019s representative would \n 16\ntalk through a print out of a PowerPoint presentation and then give their media agency contact \na CD containing the full presentation. It was generally acknowledged that the primary \nfunction of these informal meetings was the maintenance and development of the relationship \nbetween the media agency and the media owner. Each meeting relied on having a new angle \nor new material to present, thus integrating the principle of innovation \u2013 often taking the form \nof a flexible and creative relationship to data \u2013 into the very organisation heart of these market \nrelations. The framing and use of research data is fundamentally tied to these relationships as \na practitioner describes: \n \nWhat we\u2019re trying to do with research and learning and the tools and systems is to give \nmore credence to those personal relationships, to give more ammunition effectively to \nsomebody here to be able to convince an agency or a client that outdoor is the right \nroute to go conceptually.  \n \nThe third and related way in which the market was seen by practitioners as vital is in how \ninterventions in the market were understood as needing to be creative. The ideal of creativity \nmanifests itself at the level of producing classifications and modes of targeting, managing \nclient relationships and in terms of innovative ideas for advertising content. This is based on \nhaving \u2018a dynamic strategy to deliver a client\u2019s requirements\u2019 that is creative: \u2018so although it\u2019s \ninitially done on gut feel, you then sort of prop up your argument with relevant information \nand information can be twisted, manipulated in whatever way you need to actually justify \n[your pitch]\u2019. Thus, the market and the effective management of market relations is seen as \nsomething that is reliant on creativity. So when asked about recent attempts by trade bodies to \nintroduce a central database of research data as an industry standard, practitioners reacted \n 17\nwith scepticism and claimed that this would kill off creativity. Creative research and the \nmarket were seen as living things: \n \nIt\u2019s life, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what research is \u2013 it\u2019s like life will find a way, life changes, \neverything\u2019s organic, everything changes all the time\u2026 you can give the same piece of \nresearch to 10 people and they\u2019d all give you a different answer or a different \nopinion\u2026. That\u2019s great because that\u2019s what drives business \u2026.. it\u2019s a liveable, \nbreathable thing. You may as well let it organically grow and change while still trying \nto consolidate, learn and take it forward.   \n \nThis understanding of market relations as an organic, living force frames the production of \ndifference as classifications are animated by the need to \u2018make innovation\u2019. This was seen as \na vital process that is not fully within the control of its creators, but its organic or feral force \ncould be tapped. Industry practitioners understood this as a kind of commercial reproduction \nthat relies on the creative potential of gender as process to make distinctions or generate \ndifference. This produces classifications and new modes of classifying. It also enables the \nproduction of \u2018point of difference\u2019 where companies compete for market share through \npitching various tools for understanding the market. Making market relations and \u2018making \ninnovation\u2019 through gender as process are here tied together in the making of commercial life \nof not just one organisation but of broader market relationships. \n These understandings of consumers and of the operation of the market function \nperformatively; indeed, practitioners need to perform research findings quite literally in order \nfor them to have certain desired commercial effects. On one level, this works through the \ncirculation and feedback loops of the trade press and industry conferences. One practitioner \ndescribed how at conferences the trade press such as Media Week will pick up on a \u2018well \n 18\npackaged statement\u2019 about developments in the media and will circulate it as news. This then \nbecomes part of the fabric of understandings that is woven out of client and practitioner \ndiscursive practices and becomes a self-reinforcing truism: \n \nI think there\u2019s always a sense that clients will think when they hear a quote or they hear \nsome sort of expression or sort of packaged piece of information, they often assume that \nit comes from some sort of very intelligent place and therefore because it sounds \nintelligent and because they\u2019ve heard it before, it\u2019s right (as opposed to questioning the \nlogic of it). \n \nThe practices of the industry contribute to this feedback loop on another more mundane level. \nAs part of the cultural circuit of capital and capitalism\u2019s feedback loop of discursive \nproduction \u2013 of gender, of consumers, of market relations as vital \u2013 these marketing \nknowledge practices create understandings of the world that are virtual but which have \nmaterial effect. Through their recursive circulation, they perform market relations and their \n\u2018soft\u2019 discursive production is folded into the \u2018hard economics\u2019 and bottom line of companies\u2019 \nbalance sheets. \nBut what I wish to explore in more detail here is the gendered quality of this process \nrather than just the gendered nature of specific market classifications. In their study of \nfinancial market traders, Knorr Cetina and Bruegger note the sexualised and violent language \nin which the traders describes their work practices: \u2018\u201cI got shafted\u201d, \u201cI got bent over\u201d, \u201cI got \nblown up\u201d, \u201cI got raped\u201d, \u201cI got stuffed\u201d\/\u201cthe guy stuffed me\u201d, \u201cI got fucked\u201d, \u201cI got \nhammered\u201d, and \u201cI got killed\u201d\u2019 (Knorr Cetina and Bruegger 2002b: 940). Knorr Cetina and \nBruegger emphasise how this language reflects a visceral engagement with the screen as \nmarket, but what is equally striking is its gendered and sexualised character. It is unsurprising \n 19\nthat financial market traders should articulate their work practices in this way as it has been \nestablished that gender is an \u2018organizing principle\u2019 in the managerial workplace (Kerfoot and \nKnights 1993: 660; also see Alvesson and Billing 1997). Many studies have noted the \nmasculine character of corporate ideals, work practices, and workers\u2019 subjective orientation to \nwork-place cultures (e.g. Chalmers 2001). The masculinity of such organisations is \n\u2018technically rational, performance-oriented, highly instrumental, devoid of intimacy yet \npreoccupied with identity, and driven by rarely reflected upon corporate or bureaucratic goals \nthat are presumed inviolable\u2019 (Knights and Kerfoot 2004: 436).  \nThese corporate or bureaucratic goals are currently thought to be shifting in response \nto a perceived need for rapid organisational response and agility, and a parallel need for new \n\u2018fast\u2019 subjectivities. These are \u2018calculating subjects, able to withstand the exigencies of faster \nand faster return\u2019 whose personhood is built upon \u2018potential for innovation and creativity\u2019 \n(Thrift 2000: 676, 688). More broadly, these subjects are thought to require highly developed \ncommunication, inter-personal and self-presentational skills and an ability to work upon \nthemselves as a form of project. But while this enterprising subject may be seen by some as \nentirely new, Ann Gray (2003: 500) argues that \u2018many of the characteristics of this subject are \nshared with those of the ideal feminine subject of modernity\u2019. This subject is engaged in a \nproject of the self that requires aesthetic, corporeal, physical and emotional knowledges and \nskills that women have acquired by \u2018inhabiting femininity\u2019 and engaging with the plethora of \npopular culture forms that offer templates for making and re-making female subjectivities \n(Gray 2003: 500). As an ever-shifting set of gender performances often centred on \nconsumption practices, this is a subject that is literally built from innovation and creativity.                            \nWhile these gendered knowledges and skills may be acquiring new value in \ncontemporary corporate culture as Gray suggests, there is ample evidence that women are not \nnecessarily benefiting from this new development. For instance, Ros Gill\u2019s study of creativity \n 20\nand new media workers shows how the features of and skills required for project-based work \n\u2013 \u2018informality and flexibility \u2013 are the very mechanisms through which inequality is \nreproduced\u2019 (Gill 2002: 86). Indeed, in the gendered performances of creativity that are now \nemphasised in corporate culture, women\u2019s gender performances may not be recognised as \nperformances and may thus go unrewarded (Adkins 2001, 2005).While my analysis \ncomplements this interest in work-place gender performances, my focus is directed at the \ngendering of corporate processes of innovation and creativity.  \n \n \nMaking innovation \u2013 gender as commercial autogenesis  \n \nI am arguing that gender as genre or type is implicated in the very performance of market \nrelations and specifically the knowledge practices that form a feedback loop and materialise \nvirtual understandings. This is a conversation that capitalism seems to be having with itself, \nand gender and genre form key syntactical orientations in these understandings. Various \nclassifications of the female consumer are centrally important to the industry as consumption \nis still so strongly associated with women. On another level, this gendering of the market in \nmy study took the form of an animation by creativity and intuition of the market relations \nbetween media owners, media agencies and clients. But more fundamentally, the very process \nof securing, maintaining and reproducing market relations was itself gendered. This is not just \nan animation of the market \u2013 although there is evidence in my study of practitioner \nunderstandings of market relations as a life-form \u2013 but a form of reproduction. Here the \nreproduction of people as populations of consumers in processes of marketing taxonomy is \nlinked to the reproduction of market relations (as profit-making, relatively stable and to some \nextent amenable to prediction or commercial forecasting). As a means of \u2018sorting things out\u2019 \n 21\n(Bowker and Star 2000) \u2013 whether products or classifications of consumers \u2013 such \ntaxonomising practices make the commercial world more stable and manageable. \nTropes of vitalism and organicism have long been evident in conceptualisations of \nsociety and market relations (Foucault 2000; Gibson-Graham 1996). And as O\u2019Neill and \nGibson-Graham (1999) point out, corporations include a range of ideals of stability and \nprogress in their self-narratives, and are organised by a number of different logics of \nreproduction. The specific logic I have highlighted here is an idea of reproduction as a kind of \nautogenesis, and the performance of this ideal is characterised by a productive recursivity. \nThis ideal of autogenesis organises a future-oriented set of practices and ideals which aim to \nensure the continued life of commerce by \u2018making innovation\u2019 or constituting and \nmaintaining the creative processes whereby market relationships cohere and subsist. \nReproduction is here framed and enacted by practitioners as competitive commercial survival. \nIn this industry, creativity is framed by its practitioners as a vital force that has the capacity to \ncreate \u2018the consumer\u2019 as classification; it understood and acted upon as a force of calculative \npower and of creative potential. This is linked to persuasion \u2013 not just of consumers to buy \ncommodities, but of actors in the market to continue to engage in commercial relationships. \nIn their important work on economics, J.K. Gibson-Graham (1996, 2006) argue that \nwe must not produce an essentialised and universalised idea of \u2018the market\u2019, and should not \nmistake the ideas of a \u2018reproductive dynamics\u2019 that circulate within corporations and within \nacademic analysis as evidence of an ontology or essential \u2018structure\u2019 of capitalism, the \nmarket, or of specific market relations. Indeed, in working towards an ethical stance which \nfacilitates alternatives to capitalism, we must look for contingency and possibility, and we \nmust develop a style of thinking \u2018that tolerates \u201cnot knowing\u201d and allows for contingent \nconnection and the hiddenness of unfolding\u2019 (Gibson-Graham 2006: xxxi). I agree with and \nhope to take part in this intellectual project, but I think it is also important to recognise that \n 22\npractitioners in corporations also share similar thinking styles and orientation (if not the \npolitical ideals). \nI am not suggesting that market relations or capitalism are vital in the sense of having \nsome form of living ontology, or that they have some underlying structure that replicates itself \nacross time and space. I am highlighting how market practitioners\u2019 understandings of the \nmarket and their own practices as vital or enlivened, and specifically as having reproductive \ncapacity, facilitate specific market relationships and offer corporations productive narratives \nor self-representations that enable them to imagine and work into commercial futures. The \nrecursive nature of the circulation of these representations \u2013 representational performances of \ntaxonomies of \u2018the consumer\u2019 and representations of market relations as vital and alive \u2013 \nfunction to make worlds in the manner suggested by Lazzarato\u2019s analysis. \nThese are commercial worlds in which gender functions as genesis or the capacity for \nreproducibility. This capacity for genesis is crucial for the production of difference in the \never-shifting classification of consumers driven by the pressing need for \u2018point of difference\u2019 \nand competitive advantage between firms. In their aim to \u2018make innovation\u2019 and ensure the \nongoing, future-oriented existence of their market relations, the practitioners in my study are \nengaged in projects of making difference through an ideal of pure commerce. This is an ideal \nof commercial autogenesis. The vitalism that is performed in the market relations of the \noutdoor advertising industry, and perhaps in other corporate organisations, is a commercial \n\u2018life\u2019 of creation and creativity made by masculine ideas: a kind of reproduction without \nwomen. As suggested by recent studies of the workplace, these ideals and practical \nmanifestations can be inhabited most successfully by men. This is significant because it \nmatters who has the power to define \u2018life\u2019 just as it matters how we conceptualise society in \norder to develop a politics of hope (Gibson-Graham 2006; Thrift 2008).  \n 23\nBut these are uneven and perhaps unpredictable processes: there are tensions in the \nimplications of these conceptualisations of life. In the commercial world I observed, there is a \nmessy cohabitation of various working concepts and also a valuing of whatever is seen as \nmost creative at the time or what can \u2018make innovation\u2019 in the most commercially productive \nway. From an academic perspective, the tensions offer interesting conceptual challenges. The \ntrope of reproduction or commercial renewal observed in the industry draws on, and perhaps \nreinscribes more firmly, notions of gender as a male\u2013female duality in the manner suggested \nby Gibson-Graham (1996). This may have the effect of framing capitalism as a wholeness or \ntotality in ways that encourage economic deterministic thought. But at the same time, the \nways in which these ideas of vitality or organicism circulate in commercial practices, \ncommercial thinking and academic analyses suggests a more promiscuous scope of what can \ncounts as \u2018life\u2019, as male\/female, as agentic, or even as politically positive.  \nAs well as highlighting the work of such concepts, the study raises issues about \ntensions between representational and vitalist approaches. In the industry, gender as kind or \ntype operates in representational terms to frame classifications or taxonomies of consumers, \nbut simultaneously gender is articulated as generative process and is acted out in terms that \nare more vitalist. These differing understandings are performed in the industry according to a \npragmatic rationale of what can be made to work at that moment and what can perform \ncommercial futures in ways that can be profitably inhabited. For academic analysis, broader \nissues are invoked as well as questions about our investments in those issues. The tension \nbetween representational and vitalist approaches \u2013 at least in relation to this study \u2013 revolves \nin part around questions of referentiality and I am restricted here to merely signalling these as \nsignificant themes for further discussion. As Bell (2007) notes, vitalism as discussed in recent \nacademic debates is defined as self-organising, self-generative and references nothing outside \nitself. It is internally differentiated and differentiating. In contrast, we could say that \n 24\nrepresentational approaches are founded on difference that is in some way \u2018external\u2019 but \nconstitutive: as many feminist accounts have argued, difference is the condition of \nrepresentation. This issue of referentiality raises important questions about the work of gender \nand about the nature of contemporary capitalism, particularly in relation to their apparently \nperformative character. These questions are just beginning to be thought through and as Bell \nargues, it is important not to see the introduction of vitalism to academic discussions as a \nparadigm shift for, \u2018\u201clife\u201d does not replace \u2018performance\u2019 or \u2018the social\u2019\u201d (2007: 117, original \nemphasis). One of the key challenges now is to think about their relationality. \n \nHaraway (1997) shows how gender as genre, type and brand articulates the very idea \nof \u2018life\u2019 tied to capitalist relations of property. This understanding of gender is certainly \nevident in my study of the commercial practices of the outdoor advertising industry. But I \nhave argued that alongside this understanding is a performative articulation of gender as a \ntype of process. This is characterised by innovation and creativity in which the creative power \nof genre or type is enacted in performative practices which organise a reproductive process \nthat at once makes the future and makes money. If some industries are organising (in part) \naround vitalist understandings, we need to ask about the conditions of production of such \nunderstandings and about why such conceptualisations are found useful at this moment in \ncapitalism\u2019s history. And if a key characteristic of contemporary capitalism is its production \nand circulation of multiple knowledges (LiPuma and Lee 2004), alongside new ways in which \ncapitalism is processing understandings of itself (Thrift 2008), then questions are opened up \nabout the relationship of academic and commercial knowledge-producing activities. What \ndoes this mean for conceptualising capitalism, the role of gender in the corporation, and the \npossibilities of thinking as a political practice? \n \n 25\nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank for following for very helpful discussions and comments on earlier \ndrafts of this paper: Lisa Adkins, Maureen McNeil, Lucy Suchman, Elaine Swan. \n \nReferences \n \nAdkins, Lisa (2005) \u2018The new economy, property and personhood\u2019, Theory, Culture and \nSociety, 22(1): 111-130. \n \nAdkins, Lisa (2001) \u2018Cultural feminization: \u201cmoney, sex and power\u201d for women\u2019, Signs: \nJournal of Women in Culture and Society, 26(3): 669-695. \n \nAlvesson, Mats & Yvonne Due Billing (1997) Understanding Gender and Organizations. \nLondon: Sage. \n \nBell, Vikki (2007) Culture and Performance: The Challenge of Ethics, Politics and Feminist \nTheory.
