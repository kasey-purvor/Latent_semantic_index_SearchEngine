There are \nsocial gradients in unemployment and economic inactivity so it was hypothesised that they may \ncontribute to the social gradient in self rated health. \nMethods: Data on employment status, socio-economic position (SEP), and self-rated heath were \nobtained for people of working age (25-59) who had ever worked from a 3% sample of the 2001 \nEnglish census. The age adjusted prevalence differences in not good general health for four \nseparate measures of SEP were compared to the prevalence differences obtained after additional \nadjustment for employment status.   \nResults: Prevalence differences for not good health were reduced by 50% or over when \nadjusting for employment status (for men ranging from 57% to 81%, for women 50% to 74%). \nDiscussion: The social gradient in employment status contributes greatly to the social gradient in \nself-reported health. Understanding why this is the case could be important for tackling social \ninequalities in health.  \n \n158 words   \n \nKeywords: employment, social gradient, health inequalities, work, self reported health.  \n 3 \nBACKGROUND \nHealth varies by employment status, with unemployment and economic inactivity being \nassociated with an increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality.\n1-8\n The social gradients in the \nrisk of unemployment and economic inactivity may contribute to the social gradient in health. So, \nusing census data, this study asks \u201cto what extent does adjusting for employment status reduce \nthe social gradient in self reported health amongst men and women in England\u201d?  \n \n \nMETHODS \nA 3% sample of the 2001 English census was used (the Individual Sample of Anonymised \nRecords).\n9\n The analysis sample was people of working age (25 to 59) excluding full time \nstudents, those living in communal residences (e.g hospitals) and the 1.3% of men and 3.9% of \nwomen who had never worked. We excluded the never worked as there is some evidence, \nparticularly for men, that this group includes many people unable to work due to pre-existing \nhealth conditions.\n10\n The final sample sizes were 349,699 women and 349,181 men. Data on self-\nreported health, employment status, socio-economic position (SEP) and age were extracted. The \ncensus form is available online (http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk\/census2001\/pdfs\/H1.pdf). Self rated \ngeneral health was assessed in the census, for the first time in 2001, by the following question \n\u201cOver the last twelve months would you say your health has on the whole been \u2026 Good? Fairly \ngood? Not good?\u201d. The coding of employment status and four census measures of SEP are given \nin Table 1. Income was not measured in the census.  \n \nAll analysis was conducted using Stata version 10.\n11\n As men and women have different overall \nrates and patterns of employment it was decided a priori to analyse each gender separately. \n \nAs the data is cross-sectional we focused on the prevalence of not good health by SEP. We \nstudied the prevalence difference in not good health to ascertain the contribution of employment \nstatus to the absolute rate of not good health for each SEP group. We fitted generalised linear \n 4 \nmodels with a binomial distribution and an identity link to obtain the prevalence difference. In all \nanalysis the \u201chighest\u201d SEP group is the reference. To judge the extent of inequalities by each \nseparate measure of SEP (Models A in Table 1) and by employment status (Model C) we fitted \nage only adjusted models. To assess the impact of controlling for employment status on the \nseparate age adjusted SEP models we then additionally adjusted for employment status (Models \nB) and calculated the % reduction in prevalence difference in each category using the formula \n(prevalence difference in age adjusted model \u2013 prevalence difference in age and employment \nadjusted model)\/ (prevalence difference in age adjusted model). To assess the overall health \ngradient for the SEP measures (education and housing tenure) with more than two groups we \nalso calculated the slope index of inequality. It can be regarded as a measure of the health \ngradient from the highest to lowest group.\n12\n For employment status (Model C) we additionally \ncontrolled for all measures of SEP (Model D) to assess their attenuating impact.  \n \nRESULTS \nThe majority of men and women were in employment although women\u2019s rate of employment was \nlower (Table 1). For those out of work, economic inactivity was more common than \nunemployment. Overall 7.6% of men and 8% of women reported not good general health. As \nexpected in age only adjusted analysis (Models A) rates of not good health increased with lower \nSEP. In Models B, which additionally controlled for employment status, socio-economic \ndifferences were attenuated by 50% or over (for men ranging from 57% to 81%, for women 50% \nto 74%).  \n \nAs an example, 5.6% of men living in owner occupied housing had not good general health \ncompared to 19.1% of men in social rented housing, an age adjusted difference of 13% points. \nAfter further adjustment for employment status this difference reduced to 2.5% points, a reduction \nof 81%. The slope index of inequality for housing tenure, as an overall measure of SEP, was \nreduced by 81% after controlling for employment status. \n \n 5 \nRates of not good health were higher amongst non-employed groups (Table 1, Model C). \nAdjusting for all measures of SEP (Table 1, Model D) attenuated the differences somewhat for \nthose looking after the family or the home and the unemployed but made little impact for other \ngroups.  \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nOur results suggest that for both men and women employment status attenuates significantly \nSEP differences in not good health. These results suggest that the social gradient in employment \nstatus could be an important contributor to the social gradient in self rated general health. Arber \nusing survey data also reported an important role for non employment in the association between \nsocial class and self rated health.\n13\n Our work extends this to a wider range of socio-economic \nvariables and a more recent, larger and highly representative dataset as well providing a \nquantification of the impact.  \n \nWhy employment status may play such an important role in the relationship between SEP and \nself rated health cannot be ascertained in this cross-sectional study. We can only suggest some \nreasons. The relationship may run from poor health to non-employment to low SEP. In other \nwords health selection may be important. It is notable that the highest rate of not good health was \nin those describing their economic inactivity as being due to permanent sickness and disability. \nHowever, education as a SEP measure may be more robust to health selection as it is mainly \nachieved earlier in adult life.\n14\n  \n \nIf employment status affects, directly or indirectly, self rated health, it is therefore more likely to be \nthrough either poverty or differences in income (employment may better reflect income \ndifferences than our other measures of SEP) or differences in health behaviours (although the \nevidence is more equivocal on this) or through psychosocial mechanisms such as stress.\n5\n Finally, \n 6 \nemployment status may capture very well socio-economic differences across the lifecourse better \nthan any single measure of SEP at one single point of time.\n6\n \n \nIn conclusion our results suggest that it will be important for tackling health inequalities to \nunderstand why the social gradient in employment status seems to contribute so much to the \nsocial gradient in health. \n \n  \n \n 7 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe 2001 SARs are provided through the Cathy Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Research \n(University of Manchester), with the support of the ESRC and JISC.

Further work is needed to understand why this is the case but interventions which \nfind and help people retain work may be important for reducing health inequalities. \n \n 8 \nWhat is known on this subject \nPrevious studies have shown that unemployment and economic inactivity are associated with \nworse morbidity and mortality and that unemployment and economic inactivity are socially \ngraded. \n \nUnemployment and economic inactivity are therefore considered to be potentially very \nimportant social determinants of health which contribute greatly to the social gradient in health \nand to socio-economic health inequalities. \n \nHowever, existing studies have tended to focus specifically on the health of the unemployed \nor inactive, not on the contribution of employment status to the social gradient in health.  \n \n \n \nWhat this study adds \nUsing data on self reported health from the 2001 English Census, this study is the first to \nquantify the effects of employment status on the social gradient and socio-economic \ninequalities in health. \n \nIn keeping with existing research, the study found that regardless of socio-economic position, \npeople experiencing unemployment or economic inactivity have worse self rated than those in \nemployment.   \n \nIn addition, the results demonstrate that employment status contributes greatly to the social \ngradient in self-reported health, with unemployment and economic inactivity contributing up to \n81% of the excess in self reported not good health amongst the lowest socio-economic \ngroups.  \n \n  \n \n 9 \nREFERENCES \n1.
