However, through a review of the published literature we show that Oithona spp. 27 \nbiomass can vary widely both over the year and with latitude. Thus, the present study set out 28 \nto investigate the basin scale variability in biomass, stage structure and reproduction of 29 \nOithona spp. in relation to changes in hydrographic, physico-chemical and biological 30 \nparameters encountered during three cruises conducted between April and November 2002 in 31 \nthe Irminger Sea, North Atlantic. Here we found that Oithona spp. biomass varied 32 \nsignificantly with temperature and with dinoflagellates biomass concentration. On the other 33 \nhand, O. similis egg production rates (EPR) increased with both ciliates and dinoflagellates 34 \nconcentrations, rather than with temperature. The inverse relationship we found between 35 \nOithona spp. naupliar recruitment with Calanus spp. and fish larvae abundance suggests that 36 \npredation pressure may contribute to control the spatial variation in the stage structure and 37 \nbiomass of Oithona spp. and that the nauplii of this genus may serve as a food source for 38 \nother planktonic organisms prior to the spring phytoplankton bloom. 39 \n 3\nIntroduction 40 \nThe biomass and production of Oithona spp. is considered relatively more stable in 41 \nspace and time than that of larger calanoid copepods (Paffenh\u00f6fer, 1993; Nielsen and 42 \nSabatini, 1996; Pag\u00e8s et al., 1996). Such stability has been mainly attributed to continuous 43 \nand steady reproduction rates (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996), low mortality rates (Hirst and 44 \nKi\u00f8rboe, 2002; Eiane and Ohman, 2004), low metabolic rates (Castellani et al., 2005a) and 45 \nthe ability of these small cyclopoids to exploit microbial food webs more efficiently than 46 \ncalanoid copepods (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996). Published data, however, shows that the 47 \nbiomass of cyclopoids can be characterised by large seasonal and spatial fluctuations (Uye 48 \nand Sano, 1998; Hansen et al., 2004). Such contrasting observations raise questions about the 49 \nfactors determining the spatio-temporal variation of Oithona spp. biomass and production. 50 \nChanges in population abundance depend on the balance between birth rate, mortality 51 \nrates and the degree of geographical isolation (Townsend et al., 2004). Body size, food 52 \navailability and temperature are all factors which have shown to be important determinants of 53 \negg production and growth rates in calanoids (White and Roman, 1992; Castellani and 54 \nAltunba\u015f, 2006) but the effect of these variables on the fecundity of cyclopoid copepods is 55 \nless clear due to paucity of data (Bunker and Hirst, 2004). The year round presence of 56 \nOithona spp. (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996; Uye and Sano, 1998; Hansen et al., 2004) makes 57 \nthis genus also a potential food source for fish larvae (Kane, 1984), large calanoid copepods 58 \n(Metz and Schnack-Schiel, 1995) and other planktonic organisms (Hopkins and Torres, 59 \n1989). Although, Oithona spp. has been reported to have relatively low predation mortality 60 \nrates (Eiane and Ohman, 2004), field observations (Ussing, 1938) and modeling studies 61 \n(Carlotti and Slagstad, 1997) have suggested that predation could control the population 62 \ndynamics of this genus. In addition, spatial changes in copepod abundance and productivity 63 \ncan also arise as a result of frontal systems (Nishikawa et al., 1995), advection (Basedow et 64 \nal., 2004) and sampling water masses of different origin (Beaugrand et al., 2002).  65 \nInvestigations on the biology of Oithona spp. in the North Atlantic has been 66 \ntemporally and spatially limited (Bainbridge and Corlett, 1968; Gislason, 2003) and 67 \ndetermination of changes in the life stages composition and biomass of this genus has been 68 \nrestricted to the use of large (\u2265 200 \u03bcm) mesh size nets (Gislason, 2003). Thus, the present 69 \npaper investigates the basin scale variation in population structure, biomass and production of 70 \nOithona spp. at coastal and oceanic stations in the Irminger Sea. In particular we asked the 71 \nfollowing questions: How variable is Oithona spp. stage composition, biomass and production 72 \nspatially and seasonally? What are the factors which may determine such variation? Could 73 \n 4\nOithona spp. represent a food source for other planktonic organisms prior to the 74 \nphytoplankton bloom? 75 \n 76 \nMethod 77 \nPhysical and chemical characterization of the study area 78 \nThe study was carried out during a series of cruises in the Irminger Sea in spring (18th 79 \nApril \u2013 27th May, D262), summer (25th July \u2013 28th August, D264) and winter (6th November \u2013 80 \n18th December, D267) 2002 on RRS Discovery (Fig. 1). At each station, temperature, salinity 81 \nand fluorescence were recorded with a Sea-Bird conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and a 82 \nfluorometer (Wetlabs 117) instrument package mounted on a 24-position (General Oceanics 83 \nModel SBE 32) rosette equipped with 10 liter Teflon coated Niskin bottles. The continuous 84 \nCTD data were calibrated by water collected in discrete Niskin bottle samples on the rosette. 85 \nSamples for inorganic nutrient analyses were drawn directly from Niskin bottles into 86 \npolystyrene coulter counter vials and stored at 4 \u00b0C until analysis, which commenced within 87 \n12 h of sampling. 88 \nNitrate and silicate concentrations were determined using a Skalar Sanplus 89 \nautoanalyser following the methods outlined in Sanders and Jickells (Sanders and Jickells, 90 \n2000). Overall, the precision of the data from individual cruises are estimated to be better than 91 \n\u00b1 0.18 \u03bcmol L-1 for nitrate and \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcmol L-1 for silicate (1% of top standard for nitrate, and 92 \n0.5% for silicate). 93 \n 94 \nMicroplankton composition and chlorophyll-a concentration 95 \nSamples of 100 mL for microplankton identification were immediately fixed with 96 \nLugol\u2019s iodine at a final concentration of 2% (Nielsen and Ki\u00f8rboe, 1994). Half of the bottle 97 \nvolume was settled (Uterm\u00f6hl, 1958) and counted with an inverted microscope (B\u00e5mstedt et 98 \nal., 2002). Microplankton was sized and counted using a Nikon inverted microscope and taxa 99 \nidentified according to Lessard and Swift (Lessard and Swift, 1986) and Burkill et al., 100 \n(Burkill et al., 1993). Cell volume was converted to carbon according to Strathmann 101 \n(Strathmann, 1967) for phytoplankton and using a factor of 0.19 pg C \u03bcm-3 for ciliates (Putt 102 \nand Stoecker, 1989). Chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration, microplankton biomass and 103 \ncommunity structure were determined from samples collected with CTD bottles at different 104 \ndepths (5, 10, 20, 70, 100 and 150 m). Chl concentration was measured fluorometrically with 105 \na Turner Design fluorometer (TD700) by filtering between 100 mL and 1L aliquots onto GF\/F 106 \nfilters that were extracted for 24 hours in the dark in 90 % acetone. 107 \n 5\nCopepod biomass and stage composition 108 \nCopepod biomass was determined at the stations shown in Fig. 1. The number of 109 \nstations sampled, however, varied between cruises and therefore, a total of 39, 29 and 7 110 \nstations were sampled during spring, summer and winter respectively (Fig. 1). At each station 111 \nthe zooplankton was sampled using a 63 \u03bcm bongo net fitted with a back-stop flowmeter 112 \n(General Oceanics) vertically towed from 120 m depth. The samples were immediately 113 \nconcentrated by sieving through an appropriate filter and fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde. 114 \nOithona spp. was enumerated at all stations with a dissecting microscope according to Omori 115 \nand Ikeda (Omori and Ikeda, 1984). About 50 nauplii (NI-NVI) and 50 copepodites (CI-CVI) 116 \nwere sized and staged, for each sample, according to Gibbons and Ogilvie (Gibbons and 117 \nOgilvie, 1933) using a Nikon inverted microscope. A detailed analysis of the spatial 118 \ndistribution of the Oithona spp. stages could be carried out only in spring. Although, sizing of 119 \nthe Oithona spp. specimens was carried out also for the summer and winter samples, an in 120 \ndepth analysis of the stages could not be undertaken for these two cruises due to lack of time. 121 \nOithona spp. abundance was converted to biomass by means of the length-weight regression 122 \nof Sabatini and Ki\u00f8rboe (Sabatini and Ki\u00f8rboe, 1994). The nauplii were not speciated and, 123 \ntherefore, the abundance and biomass of the two Oithona species found in the study area, O. 124 \nsimilis and O. spinirostris, were considered together as Oithona spp. 125 \nWe also used the plankton data collected during the D262 cruise in spring, by the 126 \nMarine Productivity \u201cbroad scale survey\u201d project (courtesy of S. Hays and M. Heath, 127 \nFisheries Research Services, UK) with the ARIES system (Dunn et al., 1993) and the 128 \nOCEAN sampler (Sameoto et al., 2000) at the same stations sampled by the present study. 129 \nBoth samplers were designed to collect a sequential set of discrete plankton net samples 130 \ndelineated by sub-sea pressure intervals during the descent and ascent-legs of an oblique 131 \ntowed deployment. The ARIES used a 200 \u03bcm mesh size filtering net and stored a sequence 132 \nof samples at intervals corresponding to 50 m or 75 m between the sea surface and a 133 \nmaximum of 3000 m depth (i.e. a maximum total of 60 samples per station). The OCEAN 134 \nsampler was equipped with 7 nets of 95 \u03bcm mesh size that were opened and closed in 135 \nsequence on the ascent-leg of each tow from 400 m to the surface, according to a pressure 136 \nschedule corresponding to 100 m depth intervals between 400 m and 100 m, and 25 m 137 \nintervals between 100 m and the surface. Both plankton samplers were fitted with calibrated 138 \nflow meters, and the volumes filtered per net sample was on the order of 10\u201315 m3 for ARIES 139 \nand 1\u20132 m3 for OCEAN sampler.  140 \n 6\nThe ARIES data were used to investigate predation pressure on Oithona spp. studying 141 \nthe relationship between an index of naupliar recruitment for Oithona spp. (i.e. the nauplii to 142 \negg abundance ratio, N\/E thereafter) versus the abundance of large (> 200 \u03bcm) planktonic 143 \norganisms, found in the catch, known to be either omnivores or carnivores (Ruppert and 144 \nBarnes, 1994). Thus, according to this definition the following planktonic organisms were 145 \nidentified, from the ARIES catch, as potential predators on Oithona spp.: the stages CI-CV 146 \ncopepodites and CVI females of Calanus hyperboreus, Calanus finmarchicus, and Calanus 147 \nglacialis, the adult stages of Pareuchaeta spp., the adult stages of Meganyctiphanes 148 \nnorvegica, the adult stages of the euphausid species Thysanoessa longicaudata, T. inermis, T. 149 \nrascii and Euphausia krohnii, total Chaetognatha, Sagitta maxima, Euchronia hamata, total 150 \njellyfish, Pleurobrachia spp., Beroe spp. and fish larvae. The OCEAN sampler data were used 151 \nto investigate the vertical distribution of the nauplii and copepodites of Oithona spp.  152 \n 153 \nEggs per sac, egg production rate, specific egg production rate, the proportion of 154 \nreproducing females and secondary production 155 \nO. similis eggs per sac (ES), egg production rate (EPR), weight-specific egg 156 \nproduction rate (SEPR) and relative abundance of reproducing females (RAF) in the 157 \npopulation were determined at all the stations sampled (Fig. 1). The eggs sacs of O. similis 158 \nwere identified according to Eaton (Eaton, 1971) and from direct observation of the egg sacs 159 \nproduced by the females of this genus during preliminary experiments made in the present 160 \nstudy. At each station thirty egg sacs were dissected and the eggs sized and counted using an 161 \ninverted microscope. Total egg concentration was calculated using both the egg sacs found 162 \nattached and detached from the female body. Egg carbon content was estimated from egg 163 \nvolume assuming a conversion factor of 0.14 pg C \u03bcm-3 (Ki\u00f8rboe et al., 1985). The prosome 164 \nlength of 30 females was also measured in the same way as for the eggs and the length 165 \nconverted to carbon (Sabatini and Ki\u00f8rboe, 1994). At each station, the EPR (eggs female-1 d-1) 166 \nof the population of O. similis were calculated using the egg to female ratio (E\/F) estimated 167 \nfrom the preserved 63 \u03bcm net samples and the egg hatching rate (HR, % d-1) using depth 168 \nintegrated in situ temperature (T, \u02daC) from the linear equation reported by Nielsen et al., 169 \n(Nielsen et al., 2002): 170 \n 171 \nHR = 4.217 + 1.754 T  Eq. 1 172 \n 173 \nThe EPR of O. similis were, therefore, calculated as: 174 \n 7\n 175 \nEPR = (E\/F)*(HR\/100)  Eq. 2 176 \n 177 \nO. similis SEPR (d-1) was then calculated multiplying EPR by the ratio of the eggs 178 \n(Egg C) and the female (Female C) carbon content: 179 \n 180 \nSEPR = (EPR)*(Egg C\/Female C)  Eq. 3 181 \n 182 \nOithona spp. production was then estimated from depth integrated biomass of all the 183 \nstages and with juvenile specific growth rates equal to SEPR (Berggreen et al., 1988). The 184 \nproportion of reproducing females (RAF) in each sample was calculated from the ratio of the 185 \ntotal number of females and pair of egg sacs, assuming that a female produces two egg sacs 186 \nand that the egg sacs stay attached to the female body until the eggs hatch. 187 \n 188 \nResults 189 \nHydrography 190 \nThe study area is situated within the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and it extends from 191 \nthe south-western part of the Iceland shelf (IS) and the Reykjanes Ridge (RR) to the shelf of 192 \nGreenland (Fig. 1A). The surface circulation in the Irminger Sea, illustrated in Fig. 1A, is 193 \nbased on analyses by Pollard et al., (Pollard et al., 2004 and references therein). 194 \nOceanographically the Irminger Sea is a diverse region with influences from the subtropical 195 \nthermocline via the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and from the Arctic via the dense northern 196 \noverflow. It is dominated by the Irminger Current (IC), a branch of the NAC which enters the 197 \nIrminger Sea from the south and moves north and west into the Greenland shelf. Most of the 198 \nIC turns southwards as part of the complex East Greenland Current (EGC) which carries 199 \nwater of Arctic origins along the edge of the Greenland shelf (Fig. 1A).  200 \nThe results of the physical oceanographic analyses on the three research cruises have 201 \nalready been dealt with in detail in Holliday et al., (Holliday et al., 2006). In their study, 202 \nHolliday et al., (Holliday et al. 2006) have identified six zones in the Irminger Sea on the 203 \nbasis of their salinity, temperature, nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration (Table I). 204 \nThese zones correspond to hydrographic features including major currents [i.e. the IC further 205 \nsubdivided into the Southern Irminger Current (SIC) and the North Irminger Current (NIC), 206 \nthe EGC further subdivided into the East Greenland Current-Polar origin (EGC-P) and the 207 \nEast Greenland Current-Atlantic origin (EGC-A)] and regions of slow circulation [i.e. Central 208 \n 8\nIrminger Sea (CIS) and the Reykjanes Ridge (RR)]. The presence of these zones, in the study 209 \narea, gave rise to four main marked fronts (Fig1B-D and Holliday et al., 2006): the Polar 210 \nFront located between the EGC-P and the EGC-A, a front present between the EGC-A and the 211 \nCIS, one between the CIS and the IC (i.e. NIC and SIC) at about 34\u00b0 W and another one 212 \npresent between the IC and the RR zones at about 30\u00b0 W. 213 \n 214 \nPhysico-chemical characteristics and microplankton biomass composition 215 \n The study area was characterized by a gradient in both temperature and salinity 216 \nsummarised in Table I, in relation to the cruises and the zones described by Holliday et al., 217 \n(Holliday et al., 2006). On the Greenland shelf, temperature ranged from 3 \u00b0C to 5.9 \u00b0C in the 218 \nEGC-P and from 6.1 \u00b0C to 8.9 \u00b0C in the EGC-A between spring and summer respectively. In 219 \nthe center of the Irminger Sea (CIS, NIC and SIC) and on the IS values ranged from 6.5 \u00b0C to 220 \n10.6 \u00b0C whereas on the RR zone, temperature reached values between 7.7 \u00b0C and 11 \u00b0C 221 \nbetween spring and summer respectively. Salinity followed a similar trend with a minimum of 222 \n33.95 in the EGC-P and a maximum of 35.18 in the RR in summer. Nutrients were plentiful 223 \nin spring and winter with concentrations up to 14 \u03bcmol L-1 for NO3 and 9 \u03bcmol L-1 for SiO3 224 \nand became depleted only by summer (Table I). In spring Chl concentration was lowest in the 225 \nCIS (0.5 mg Chl m-3) whereas its concentration increased to 0.8 mg Chl m-3 in the frontal zone 226 \nbetween the CIS and the NIC\/SIC. High Chl up to 1.7 mg Chl m-3 was also measured at the 227 \nfrontal areas separating the CIS and the RR. In summer Chl concentration varied from a 228 \nmaximum of 1.3 mg Chl m-3 in the EGC-A to a minimum of 0.8 mg Chl m-3 in the RR. In 229 \nwinter Chl concentrations were quite low ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg Chl m-3. 230 \nSpatial and temporal changes in microplankton biomass and species composition 231 \nduring the present study have already been presented elsewhere (Irigoien et al., 2003, 232 \nCastellani et al., 2005b). In spring the Greenland shelf (EGC-P) was characterized by the 233 \nearly development of a mixed flagellate-diatom bloom (Phaeocystis sp. > 80 % of the 234 \nbiomass). Such bloom resulted from the strong water column stratification due to the density 235 \ngradient induced by fresh, ice melt water within the EGC-P zone (Waniek et al., 2005). At 236 \nthis time the rest of the study area was also dominated by flagellates although here 237 \nconcentrations ranging from 5 mg C m-3 to 17.7 mg C m-3 were much lower than on the 238 \nGreenland shelf. The stations located on the frontal area between the CIS and the NIC\/SIC 239 \nwere characterized by a relatively high biomass of ciliates between 7 mg C m-3 and 44 mg C 240 \nm-3 (Fig. 2). Microplankton biomass as high as 65 mg C m-3  was also measured at the fronts 241 \nseparating the CIS and the RR, although here the community was more diverse and comprised 242 \n 9\nmainly diatoms (Chaetoceros pelagicus), dinoflagellates (Dinophysis acuminata, Gyrodinium 243 \nbritannicum) and ciliates (Strombidium spp.). In summer total microplankton biomass on the 244 \non the Greenland shelf was lower than in spring mainly due to a decrease in the concentration 245 \nof Phaeocystis sp. At this time, however, total microplankton biomass in the NIC, SIC and 246 \nCIS was higher than in spring due to an increase of diatoms and dinoflagellates concentration 247 \n(Fig. 2). On the other hand, ciliates biomass in summer was comparable to that measured in 248 \nspring at most stations with the exception of the Greenland shelf (EGC-P) and the NIC where 249 \nconcentrations where higher in summer. 250 \nIn winter, the sampling of the mesozooplankton could not be carried out within the 251 \nEGC-P, EGC-A, and SIC zones due to bad weather conditions. At this time, total 252 \nmicroplankton biomass ranging from 3.3 mg C m-3 to 8 mg C m-3 was much lower than 253 \nconcentrations measured during the previous two cruises (Fig. 2). Flagellates biomass 254 \naveraging 2.20 mg C m-3 dominated the microplankton, followed by dinoflagellates biomass 255 \naveraging 1.6 mg C m-3 and by ciliates biomass averaging 1.4 mg C m-3, whereas the mean 256 \nbiomass of diatoms had dropped considerably (0.19 mg C m-3) compared to spring and 257 \nsummer. 258 \n 259 \nOithona spp. biomass and stage composition 260 \nOithona similis and Oithona spinirostris were the only Oithona species found in the 261 \nstudy area. Although O. similis was always more numerous than O. spinirostris, the relative 262 \nproportion of these two species varied. The contribution of O. spinirostris to the total Oithona 263 \nspp. was higher in spring on the IS and the RR where it represented 15 - 20 % of the total 264 \ncopepodite abundance compared to 3 - 10 % on the Greenland shelf and at the off-shore 265 \nstations. On the other hand, in summer and winter O. spinirostris represented only 2 - 5 % 266 \nirrespective of location. 267 \nFig. 3 summarises the variation of Oithona spp. biomass measured during each cruise 268 \nwithin the different zones of the Irminger Sea. Throughout the study, the lowest Oithona spp. 269 \nbiomass was consistently observed at the shallowest stations located in the inner part of the 270 \nGreenland shelf (0.08 - 0.7 mg C m-3) within the EGC-P (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3). In spring the 271 \nhighest Oithona spp. biomass of about 1 mg C m-3 was measured on the RR whereas in 272 \nsummer a maximum of 2 mg C m-3 was recorded on the IS (Fig. 3A-B). Overall, the Oithona 273 \nspp. mean biomass (\u00b1 SE) in spring  (0.24 \u00b1 0.027 mg C m-3) was similar to that measured in 274 \nwinter (0.19 \u00b1 0.022 mg C m-3) but significantly lower (ANOVA, F[2,66] = 45.53, p < 0.0001) 275 \nthan in summer (1.14 \u00b1 0.13 mg C m-3). 276 \n 10\nOverall, the proportion of Oithona spp. nauplii and copepodites was significantly higher than 277 \nthat of the adult females which consistently accounted for between 3 % to 4 % of the total 278 \nOithona spp. stages abundance throughout the cruises (Fig. 3 and Table II). On the other 279 \nhand, the relative proportion of adult males and females varied widely both spatially and 280 \nseasonally. Females were always more numerous than males resulting, on average, in a 1:3 281 \nsex ratio.  282 \nThe proportion of nauplii and copepodites also differed between zones and cruises; in 283 \nwinter and spring the abundance of the nauplii was higher than that of the copepodites, 284 \nwhereas naupliar biomass was comparable or lower. In summer, on the other hand, 285 \ncopepodites became the most important component of the Oithona spp. population both in 286 \nterms of abundance and biomass (Fig. 3B and Table II).  287 \nDuring spring the relative biomass of nauplii in the population was lowest in the inner 288 \npart of both the EGC-P and IS shelves whereas it increased progressively offshore towards the 289 \ndeeper stations within the CIS, NIC and SIC zones. As a result, in spring, the relative 290 \nproportion of nauplii in the population of Oithona spp. was positively significantly correlated 291 \nwith depth (df = 35, r = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and salinity (df = 36, r = 0.44, p = 0.006) but not 292 \nwith temperature or with microplankton biomass. In summer, the highest relative biomass of 293 \nnauplii in the Oithona spp. population was measured off the Greenland shelf (EGC-A and 294 \nCIS) whereas the lowest was recorded on the EGC-P and it was inversely correlated with 295 \ntemperature (df = 28, r = - 0.61, p < 0.0001).  296 \nThe relative distribution of life stages of Oithona spp. within each zone during spring 297 \nis shown in Fig.4. The lowest proportion of the early naupliar stages, NI and NII, was 298 \nrecorded within the EGC-P (14 %) and IS (12 %) whereas higher values were measured 299 \nwithin the NIC (19 %), EGC-A (21 %), CIS (33 %) and RR (52 %) zones (Fig. 4A). The 300 \nproportion of adult stages (CVI), on the other hand, decreased from the EGC-P to the RR 301 \n(Fig. 4B). The distribution of the NIII-NVI naupliar stages and of the CI-CV copepodites was 302 \nmore variable and did not seem to follow any clear pattern (Fig. 4B). 303 \nThe ratio between nauplii and total egg concentration (N\/E), used here as an index for 304 \nnaupliar survival, suggests that in spring the lowest naupliar recruitment occurred on the 305 \nEGC-P and IS whereas in summer it was lowest within the NIC, CIS and RR (Fig. 5). Among 306 \nthe planktonic organisms, collected with ARIES by the \u201cbroad scale survey\u201d, Calanus spp. 307 \nCV and CVI females (df = 17, r = - 0.73, p < 0.001) and fish larvae (df = 9, r = - 0.73, p = 308 \n0.017) were significantly negatively correlated with the Oithona spp. N\/E during spring. On 309 \n 11\nthe other hand, no significant correlation was found between the N\/E and the concentration of 310 \npotential predators in summer. 311 \n 312 \nSeasonal and spatial trends in Oithona spp. stages length 313 \nThe variation in the size of the stages for the different cruises is summarized in Table 314 \nIII and for different zones in spring in Table IV. The length of the all the stages was overall 315 \nlonger in spring and winter compared to summer (Table III). Spatially, the size of the NI-NIII 316 \nstages measured in spring was largest in the CIS and smallest in the remaining zones 317 \nresembling the pattern described for the N\/E ratio. Although, the variation in length of the 318 \nolder nauplii (NIV-NVI) and copepodites (CI-CV) was higher, on average, the longest 319 \ncopepods within each stage were found in the EGC, RR and IS (Table IV). The largest 320 \nfemales of O. similis were commonly found on the EGC-P, IS and RR, whereas the smallest 321 \nwere associated with the CIS, NIC and SIC (Fig. 6). Although, female body weight was 322 \noverall inversely related to temperature (df = 53, r = - 0.66, p < 0.001, Fig. 6), during spring, 323 \nthe females sampled on the IS and RR were larger than those sampled in zones characterized 324 \nby similar temperatures (Fig. 6). 325 \n 326 \nSeasonal and spatial trends in eggs per sac, egg production rate, specific egg production 327 \nrate and the proportion of reproducing females 328 \nFig. 7 summarises the variation in eggs per sac (ES), egg production rate (EPR), 329 \nweight-specific egg production rate (SEPR) and the relative abundance of reproducing 330 \nfemales (RAF) in the population within different zones and times of the year. Overall, ES 331 \nvaried from a minimum of 5 eggs sac-1 to a maximum of 20 eggs sac-1. Mean (\u00b1 SE) ES was 332 \nsignificantly higher (ANOVA, F[2,69] = 13.6, p < 0.0001)  in spring (12 \u00b1 0.31 eggs sac-1, n = 333 \n38) compared to summer (10 \u00b1 0.33 eggs sac-1, n = 29) and winter (9 \u00b1 0.30 eggs sac-1, n = 7) 334 \nEPR varied from a minimum of < 1 egg female-1 d-1 to a maximum of 6 eggs female-1 d-1. 335 \nAgain, mean (\u00b1 SE) EPR was significantly higher (ANOVA, F[2,66] = 1.29, p = 0.283) in 336 \nspring (2.18 \u00b1 0.19 eggs female-1 d-1, n = 36) than in summer (1.9 \u00b1 0.12 eggs female-1 d-1, n = 337 \n29 ) and winter (1.63 \u00b1 0.06 eggs female-1 d-1, n = 7). O. similis SEPR varied from 0.017 d-1 to 338 \n0.13 d-1. Although, SEPR was on average higher in summer (0.059 \u00b1 0.004 d-1, n = 36) than in 339 \nspring (0.056 \u00b1 0.004 d-1, n = 29) and winter (0.047 \u00b1 0.002 d-1, n = 7) mean rates were not 340 \nstatistically different from each other (ANOVA, F[2,66] = 0.89 p = 0.416). The RAF values 341 \nmeasured at each station varied from 10 % to 100 per cent. Mean (\u00b1 SE) RAF did not show 342 \n 12\nany significant temporal variations (ANOVA, F[2,69] = 0.11 p =  0.893) with mean values of 343 \n55.3 \u00b1 3.7 %, 54.5 \u00b1 3.2 % and 51.32 \u00b1 2.3 % in spring, summer and winter respectively. 344 \nIn spring the highest ES, EPR and SEPR were measured on the RR, IS and NIC 345 \nwhereas the highest RAF was recorded on the EGC-P and the RR (Fig. 7). In summer, on the 346 \nother hand, the highest ES, EPR, SEPR and RAF were all measured within the EGC-P, EGC-347 \nA, NIC and SIC zones (Fig. 7). In winter ES, EPR, SEPR and RAF were only measured 348 \nwithin the NIC, SIC, CIS and IS and their respective mean values were similar (Fig. 7).  349 \n 350 \nO. similis biomass, eggs per sac, egg production rate, specific egg production rate and 351 \nthe proportion of reproducing females vs field parameters 352 \nThe relationship found between Oithona spp. biomass and O. similis ES, EPR and 353 \nSEPR with body size and different environmental variables is shown in Table V. Stepwise 354 \nmultiple regression analysis indicated that temperature and ln dinoflagellates explained 40 % 355 \nof the total variation in the ln biomass of Oithona spp. (Table V).  356 \nThe mean ES and EPR of the O. similis female population increased significantly with 357 \nbody weight (Fig. 8). However, Fig. 9 shows that if only the egg sacs found attached to 358 \nindividual copepods are considered, the number of eggs per sac decreases for all the females 359 \nthat were heavier than ca. 0.75 \u03bcg C (or longer than ca. 539 \u03bcm). Such decrease in ES seemed 360 \nto be associated chiefly with the females sampled within the shallowest stations on the EGC 361 \nand IS in spring but not with similarly sized females sampled in summer at the EGC stations 362 \nat comparable in situ temperatures (Fig. 9). The largest egg sacs contained the highest number 363 \nof eggs (df = 222, r = 0.82, p < 0.001) but not the largest eggs, as we found no difference in 364 \negg diameter with either the length of the egg sac or the prosome of the female. The reason 365 \nfor the differences in the lower ES and female weight in Fig. 8 compared to Fig. 9 is that Fig. 366 \n8 displays means whereas Fig. 9 shows individual values for female weight and ES. 367 \nMoreover, in Fig. 9 is a subset of the data since here we show only the eggs measured in the 368 \negg sacs that were found attached to females. 369 \nES, EPR, SEPR and RAF were also significantly positively correlated with Chl 370 \nconcentration, microplankton groups and the M:F ratio, whereas no significant correlation 371 \nwas found with either temperature or salinity. Stepwise multiple regression analysis of pooled 372 \ndata indicated that 63 % of the total variability in ES was explained by female body weight 373 \nfollowed by M:F ratio and ciliates carbon in the size range of 20 - 40 \u03bcm in cell diameter 374 \n(Table V). On the other hand, 38 % of the total variability in EPR was explained by female 375 \nbody carbon, dinoflagellates carbon and ciliates carbon in the size range of 20 - 40 \u03bcm in cell 376 \n 13\ndiameter, whereas 36 % of the variability in SEPR was accounted for by dinoflagellates 377 \ncarbon and ciliates carbon in the size range of 20 - 40 \u03bcm (Table V).  378 \n 379 \nProduction 380 \nOithona spp. production (P) in the study area varied from 1.61 \u03bcg C m-3 d-1 to 153 \u03bcg 381 \nC m-3 d-1 (Fig. 10 and Table VI). The seasonal pattern of mean (\u00b1 SE) Oithona spp. 382 \nproduction was similar to that of the biomass with the highest mean total production measured 383 \nin summer (67.02 \u00b1 9.4 \u03bcg C m-3 d-1), lower production being observed in spring (14.2 \u00b1 2.44 384 \n\u03bcg C m-3 d-1) and the lowest in winter (8.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcg C m-3 d-1). In spring the highest 385 \nproduction was measured on the RR whereas there was no clear difference between the other 386 \nareas. In summer the highest production was measured on the SIC, NIC and RR whereas the 387 \nlowest on the EGC-P. In winter the highest productions were measured on the RR and CIS 388 \nand the lowest on the NIC and IS, although, at this time sampling was not undertaken within 389 \nthe other zones. The production of the naupliar stages was comparable to that of the younger 390 \ncopepodite stages both in spring and winter (i.e. 40 % of the total P) and it was always higher 391 \nthan that of the adult female stage (Table VI). 392 \n 393 \nDiscussion 394 \nThe present study investigated the regional variation of Oithona spp. stage structure, 395 \nbiomass and productivity in the Irminger Sea, North Atlantic. Besides a general paucity of 396 \ndata for this oceanic region on an important genus such as Oithona spp., our study was 397 \nmotivated by gaining insights of the factors which may determine the reported temporal and 398 \nspatial stability in biomass and production of these cyclopoids in some areas (Nielsen and 399 \nSabatini, 1996) and high variability in other areas (Uye and Sano, 1998). For this reason the 400 \nsurvey was carried out at different times of the year and over basin scale, in regions with very 401 \ndifferent hydrographic, physico-chemical and biological attributes (Holliday et al., 2006). 402 \n 403 \nEggs per sac, egg production rate, specific egg production rate and the proportion of 404 \nreproducing females 405 \nIn the present study O. similis reproduced during all sampling occasions reaching 406 \npeaks of breeding activity in spring, as indicated by both the production of higher ES, EPR 407 \nand the proportion of reproducing females (RAF) compared to values measured during the 408 \nsummer and winter cruises (Fig. 7). The highest mean EPR, SEPR and RAF were measured 409 \non the Greenland (EGC-P) and Iceland (IS) shelves, the NIC and on the RR where both 410 \n 14\nfemale body carbon and microplankton biomass were also high (Fig. 7). Most of the 411 \nvariability in O. similis ES and EPR was explained by female body weight, followed by 412 \nciliates and dinoflagellates biomass (Table V), whereas the effect of temperature was not 413 \nsignificant over the range considered. Although, copepod reproductive rates increase with 414 \ntemperature under laboratory saturating feeding conditions (Runge, 1984), field studies have 415 \nshown that, in nature, copepods EPR can be food limited and that the effect of temperature on 416 \nfecundity is indirectly mediated by body size (Gislason, 2005; Castellani and Altunba\u015f, 2006). 417 \nNevertheless, using a large compilation of data from the literature (present study, Uye and 418 \nSano, 1998; Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996), over a wide temperature range, the effect of 419 \ntemperature on Oithona spp. SEPR (i.e. EPR standardized for copepods of different body 420 \nweight) becomes discernible (Fig. 11). 421 \nThe significant increase in EPR we found with ciliates and dinoflagellates biomass 422 \n(Table V) suggests that these organisms represent an important food source for the 423 \nreproductive success of O. similis. Such result is consistent with published literature showing 424 \nthat EPR increases with the percentage of ciliates in the diet of this species (Castellani et al., 425 \n2005b). Moreover, the significant positive relationship shown here between ciliate carbon in 426 \nthe size range of 20 - 40 \u03bcm with ES, EPR and SEPR also supports the view that O. similis 427 \nfemales tend to feed selectively on specific ciliates sizes (Castellani et al., 2005b). Although, 428 \nphytoplankton can make up a considerable fraction of the diet of Oithona spp., this copepod 429 \ngenus has been reported to prefer motile to non-motile prey, selecting ciliates preferentially to 430 \ndiatoms of similar shape and size (Atkinson, 1996). Despite finding positive correlations 431 \nbetween ES, EPR and SEPR with Chl and diatoms, these variables were eliminated during the 432 \nstepwise regression procedure. The highest Chl concentrations (i.e. > 3 \u03bcg Chl L-1) were 433 \nmeasured during a bloom of Phaeocystis sp. and, therefore, low EPR even at these high 434 \nphytoplankton concentrations is not surprising as O. similis does not tend to feed on this algal 435 \nspecies (Castellani et al., 2005b). 436 \nIncreases in ES, EPR, SEPR and RAF occurred at the fronts between the EGC-P and 437 \nEGC-A, the CIS and the NIC\/SIC, the CIS and RR and stratified water in the EGC-P, where 438 \nChl, ciliates and dinoflagellates concentrations were particularly high (Fig. 2 and Fig. 7, 439 \nHolliday et al., 2006; Yebra et al., 2006). During a concomitant study in the Irminger Sea in 440 \nsummer, Yebra et al., (Yebra et al., 2006) reported that the higher Chl concentrations up to 441 \n1.6 mg Chl m-3 they measured at the front between the NIC and CIS, (compared to the 0.25 - 442 \n0.5 mg Chl m-3 in the CIS) were associated with a five-fold increase in ciliates potential 443 \nproduction and a nine-fold increase in ciliate biomass. Thus, results from our study, suggests 444 \n 15\nthat the higher phytoplankton concentrations measured at frontal regions were transferred via 445 \nthe microzooplankton up through the food web and resulted in the higher reproductive output 446 \nof O. similis at these sites (Fig. 7).  447 \nThe low EPR, SEPR and RAF measured within the CIS, where microplankton 448 \nconcentration was lower than in the other zones, also suggest that O. similis in the CIS region 449 \nmight have been food limited. This argument is supported by results showing that in the 450 \nIrminger Sea, the energetic cost of reproduction exceeded the energy ingested by O. similis 451 \nfemales (Castellani et al., 2005b). Nielsen and Sabatini (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996) have 452 \nargued that the lack of correlation they found between O. similis SEPR with Chl and 453 \nmicroplankton in the North Sea was due to the fact that Oithona spp. was not food limited. 454 \nThe higher total microplankton and ciliates concentrations measured by Nielsen and Sabatini 455 \n(Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996) in the North Sea compared to those recorded, in the present 456 \nstudy, would support the argument put forward by these authors. Nevertheless, it cannot be 457 \nexcluded that additional food preys, which were not considered here such as copepod nauplii 458 \n(Nakamura and Turner, 1997) and faecal pellets (Gonzalez and Smetacek, 1994) might also 459 \nhave made an important contribution to the diet and reproduction of O. similis.  460 \nFertilisation depends on the encounter rate between mature males and females and, 461 \ntherefore, if the number of males becomes deficient the proportion of females fertilized and 462 \nproducing eggs in the population will decline (Ki\u00f8rboe, 2006). Thus, the significant 463 \nrelationship we found between the sex ratio with the RAF and the ES suggests that the 464 \nproportion of males in the population might also have affected O. similis reproductive rates 465 \nand warrants further investigation. 466 \nThe present study has also shown that, although, the mean ES of the O. similis 467 \npopulation increased with female body carbon (Fig. 8), the egg sacs attached to individual > 468 \n0.75 \u03bcg C from the EGC, in spring, were smaller than those produced by females of similar 469 \nweight exposed to lower temperatures but to a higher ciliates concentrations in summer (Fig. 470 \n9). This observation suggests that either low food concentration\/quality or copepod age were 471 \nthe most likely causes for the smaller ES measured in spring within the EGC zone. Smaller 472 \nES might have been produced, in fact, by older long-lived females (i.e. with lower 473 \nreproductive potential) transported on the Greenland shelf from Arctic regions by the cold 474 \nsouthward flowing EGC-P current. Cyclopoids, however, are characterized by ontogenetic 475 \nvertical distribution with the nauplii closer to the surface and the larger copepodites 476 \npositioned further down in the water column possibly to minimise predation risk (Titelman 477 \nand Fiksen, 2004). Since microzooplankton concentration, in the present study area, decreased 478 \n 16\nwith depth (Wilson, D., University of Liverpool, UK, personal communication), the smaller 479 \nES might have also resulted from larger copepods occupying a position in the water column 480 \nbelow optimal feeding conditions for maximum reproductive output. It cannot also be 481 \nexcluded that females carrying bigger egg sacs may have been preyed upon by visual 482 \npredators more easily than those with smaller ones. Further investigations are required to 483 \nverify whether the presence of O. similis females bearing smaller egg sacs is the result of 484 \nsenescence, food shortage or selective predation. 485 \n 486 \nSpatial and seasonal variations in Oithona biomass and production 487 \nPrevious studies in the Irminger Sea have either focused on larger zooplankton groups 488 \n(Bainbridge and Corlett, 1968) or used 200 \u03bcm mesh size nets (Gislason, 2003) which will 489 \nhave underestimated both the younger stages and the total biomass of smaller but abundant 490 \ncopepod species such as Oithona spp. In this respect, the depth integrated Oithona spp. 491 \nbiomass of 0.028 mg C m-3 in early April and of 0.38 mg C m-3 in June estimated [assuming a 492 \n0.45 carbon to dry weight ratio] by Gislason (Gislason, 2003) in the Irminger Sea using a 200 493 \n\u03bcm mesh size net, are lower than the mean biomass of 0.22 mg C m-3 and of ca. 1 mg C m-3 494 \nwe measured for the same area and time of the year using a 63 \u03bcm mesh size net. At the time 495 \nof our survey, Oithona spp. abundance in the Irminger Sea decreased with depth (Fig. 12 and 496 \nGislason, 2003). Thus, it is possible that the lower Oithona spp. biomass estimates reported 497 \nby Gislason (Gislason, 2003) were due to the sampling methodology adopted by this author 498 \nwho integrated biomass over the whole water column down to a depth of 2500 metres. 499 \nOur results also show that the spatial and seasonal variation in Oithona spp. biomass 500 \nin the Irminger Sea was related to both the hydrographic and the biological characteristics of 501 \nthe zones described by Holliday et al., (Holliday et al., 2006). The lowest Oithona spp. 502 \nbiomass measured at the innermost stations on the Greenland shelf, the EGC-P, was 503 \nassociated with colder and less saline water of Arctic origin. On the other hand, the increase 504 \nin biomass observed between the shelf break (EGC-A) and offshore (CIS, NIC, SIC and RR) 505 \nwas associated with progressively warmer and saltier water of Atlantic origin. Hansen et al., 506 \n(Hansen et al., 2004) have recently shown that low salinity was an important factor limiting 507 \nthe distribution and abundance of O. similis in the Baltic Sea. Although, in the present study, 508 \nOithona spp. biomass was overall positively correlated with salinity, such correlation was 509 \nonly significant for the spring data and salinity was rejected by the step-wise multiple 510 \nregression analysis on pooled data (Table V). Moreover, the lowest salinity of 30.5 measured, 511 \non the Greenland shelf, was much higher than the 7 to 16 reported for the Baltic Sea by 512 \n 17\nHansen et al., (Hansen et al., 2004). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the salinity 513 \nconcentrations encountered in the Irminger Sea, in the present study, did not significantly 514 \naffect the observed variation of Oithona spp. biomass. 515 \nThe five-fold increase in Oithona spp. biomass recorded between the EGC-P and the 516 \nRR and between spring and summer, in the present study, was statistically significant. 517 \nGislason (Gislason, 2003) has shown that in the Irminger Sea in winter and spring, the 518 \nmajority of Oithona spp. are found deeper (i.e.100 m to 400 m) in the water column than in 519 \nsummer, suggesting that this genus undergoes annual vertical migration. Therefore, results, 520 \nfrom the present study, showing that during spring and summer, 95 % of the Oithona spp. 521 \nwere found within the top 60 m of the water column (Fig. 12) is, somehow, at odds with 522 \nfindings by Gislason (Gislason, 2003). It is worth noting, however, that the abundances 523 \nreported by Gislanson (Gislason, 2003) during April and June are about a tenth of those 524 \nmeasured, in the present study, and they will be chiefly represented by larger and older 525 \nOithona spp. stages (because of the 200 \u03bcm mesh size net used by this author) which tend to 526 \nhave a deeper vertical distribution than younger but more abundant stages. 527 \nThe stage structure of the population of Oithona spp. in the Irminger Sea varied 528 \nsignificantly from spring and winter, when it was largely made up by nauplii, to summer 529 \nwhen copepodites predominated. It is reasonable to conclude that the larger 200 \u03bcm mesh size 530 \nnet used by previous studies would have missed the bulk of biomass in the surface strata 531 \nrepresented by nauplii and younger copepodites in spring. This trend would have also been 532 \nexacerbated by the fact that in summer the size of the stages is smaller (Table III). Therefore, 533 \nthe increase in Oithona spp. biomass we measured in summer was probably primarily the 534 \nresult of population growth rather than vertical migration of cyclopoids from deeper strata. 535 \nMultiple regression analysis showed that temperature explained the highest proportion 536 \nof the spatial and temporal variability of Oithona spp. biomass followed by dinoflagellate 537 \nconcentration (Table V). Oithona spp. biomass ranging from 0.7 mg C m-3 at 2.8 \u00b0C to 2 mg 538 \nC m-3 at 11\u00b0C, in the present study, fits the general trend of increasing biomass with 539 \ntemperature reported in the literature. The lowest Oithona spp. biomasses of 0.04 and 0.47 mg 540 \nC m-3 have been reported at ca. 0 \u00b0C for the Southern Ocean (Atkinson, 1998 and references 541 \ntherein). Intermediate Oithona spp. biomass values between 0.9 - 9 mg C m-3 were recorded at 542 \ntemperatures between 7 \u00b0C and 12 \u00b0C, in the North Sea, by Nielsen and Sabatini (Nielsen and 543 \nSabatini, 1996). On the other hand, very high variation in the biomass of O. davisae from 2.2 544 \nmg C m-3 at 9 \u00b0C to 92 mg C m-3 at 28 \u00b0C were measured, over the year, by Uye and Sano 545 \n(Uye and Sano, 1998) in an eutrophic inlet in Fukuyama Harbour. The significant relationship 546 \n 18\nwe found between Oithona spp. biomass and dinoflagellates also suggests that population 547 \ngrowth rates might have been food limited. Interestingly, the increase in Oithona spp. biomass 548 \nwith dinoflagellates, in the present study, is in agreement with results obtained by Head and 549 \nSameoto (Head and Sameoto, 2005) for the Newfoundland and Scotian shelves using the 550 \nContinuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data. Although there was a tendency for Oithona spp. 551 \nbiomass to be higher at the fronts, where microplankton production was higher, the pattern 552 \nwas not as evident as that observed for the reproductive parameters. Such result is, however, 553 \nnot surprising as the signal of the link between food web compartments weakens as it 554 \npropagates up towards higher trophic levels. 555 \n  The present study represents the first attempt to estimate reproduction and 556 \nproductivity of Oithona spp. in the North Atlantic. Therefore, a comparison with the literature 557 \nfor this area is not possible. Nevertheless, Oithona spp. productions ranging from 0.002 to 558 \n0.15 mg C m-3 d-1 found here are lower than estimates between 0.003 and 0.6 mg C m-3 d-1 559 \nestimated for the southern North Sea (M. Sabatini, INIDEP, Argentina, personal 560 \ncommunication) and the maximum production rates of 11 mg C m-3 d-1 reported by Uye and 561 \nSano (Uye and Sano, 1998) for O. davisae at higher temperature and at food saturating 562 \nconditions in Fukuyama Harbor. The significant spatial variation in Oithona spp. biomass and 563 \nproduction we measured in the Irminger Sea contrasts with observations of Nielsen and 564 \nSabatini (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996) who did not observe significant differences between 565 \nshallow (< 50 m) and deeper (100 - 200 m) stations in the North Sea. Our study, however, 566 \nwas conducted over basin scales at depths varying between about 100 m to 3000 m in coastal 567 \nand oceanic conditions. On the other hand, the investigation of Nielsen and Sabatini (Nielsen 568 \nand Sabatini, 1996) took place over a shorter time and within a narrower sampling area 569 \ncharacterized by higher microplankton concentration and by relatively more stable 570 \nenvironmental conditions. Thus, food limitation and\/or higher predation impact, in the present 571 \nstudy, compared to the shallower and more productive area, sampled by Nielsen and Sabatini 572 \n(Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996) in the North Sea, may be among the main reasons for the 573 \nvariability we report in the biomass and productivity of Oithona spp. 574 \nThe present study has also shown that naupliar stages contributed a comparable or 575 \nhigher fraction to both the biomass and production of Oithona spp. than copepodite stages. 576 \nThis observation contrasts with previous studies (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996; Uye and Sano, 577 \n1998) which have assumed the production rate of Oithona spp. nauplii to be negligible. 578 \nNevertheless, the production rates we report here for Oithona spp. nauplii and younger 579 \ncopepodite stages, using adult female SEPR, probably represent a conservative estimate as the 580 \n 19\ngrowth rates of copepod juveniles in situ are considered closer to food saturation rates than 581 \nthe SEPR of adult females (Hirst and Bunker, 2003). 582 \n 583 \nVariation in Oithona spp. length and stage composition 584 \nIn the Irminger Sea, the length and the percentage stage composition of Oithona spp. 585 \nvaried both spatially and seasonally. Spatial and temporal variation in the percentage stage 586 \ncomposition of Oithona spp. is surprising as this genus is considered to have relatively stable 587 \npopulations as a result of continuous reproduction (Nielsen and Sabatini, 1996; Pag\u00e8s et al., 588 \n1996) and reduced mortality rates (Eiane and Ohman, 2004). Nevertheless, the present study 589 \nhas shown that in spring the nauplii represented up to 80 % of the total abundance whereas in 590 \nsummer the population of Oithona spp. was primarily made up of late copepodite stages. The 591 \npattern observed suggests that, overall, the seasonal variation in Oithona spp. stages 592 \ncomposition was probably the result of the natural progression of the life stages initiated by 593 \nthe higher EPR in spring and continued by relatively faster growth rates stimulated by 594 \nincreasing temperatures in summer. On the other hand, spatially, the lowest proportion of NI 595 \nand NII stages was recorded in spring on the EGC-P and IS compared to the EGC-A, CIS and 596 \nNIC zones and it coincided with the lowest N\/E ratio. Since EPR, RAF and microplankton 597 \nconcentration on the EGC-P, IS and RR were higher or similar to those measured within the 598 \nEGC-A, CIS and NIC zones, it is unlikely that the lower naupliar recruitment was caused by 599 \neither low temperature or food limitation. Ussing (Ussing, 1938) speculated that the decrease 600 \nin the abundance of O. similis he measured in the fjord of East Greenland could be due to 601 \npredation pressure by large Calanus spp. Shelf areas in spring are sites of high reproductive 602 \nactivity and recruitment for planktivorous organisms such as fish larvae (Kane, 1984) and 603 \nCalanus spp. (Gislason, 2005). The inverse relationship found between Calanus spp and fish 604 \nlarvae abundance and the Oithona spp. N\/E ratio suggest that predation pressure might have 605 \ncontributed to the lower naupliar recruitment measured on the EGC-P, IS and RR during 606 \nspring (Fig. 5). The high proportion of NI-NII on the RR, however, also suggest that higher 607 \nEPR and higher egg hatching rate (i.e. due to higher temperature), in this region, were 608 \ncompensating for naupliar mortality more than in other areas (Fig. 4).    609 \nThe presence of larger stage sizes we describe for spring and winter compared to 610 \nsummer is similar to trends reported in the literature for calanoid copepods (Deevey, 1960). 611 \nTemperature, food availability (Breteler and Gonzalez, 1988) and selective predation (Warren 612 \net al., 1986) are considered the most important factors determining changes of copepod stages 613 \nlength in situ. In the present investigation, O. similis female length was overall correlated with 614 \n 20\nboth temperature and microplankton biomass. However, the presence of large females of 615 \nsimilar length within the IS, RR and EGC-P, suggests that the copepods sampled in these 616 \nzones might have all originated from colder water masses of Arctic origin and that, therefore, 617 \nhydrographic processes might have been important in determining copepod distribution. 618 \nSurprisingly, the largest NI-NIII naupliar sizes were found in the CIS where phytoplankton 619 \nand ciliate concentration were lowest compared to other zones. Nevertheless, the striking 620 \nsimilarity between the size distribution of the NI-NIII and the N\/E ratio within the zones in 621 \nspring, suggests that predation might have also contributed to determine the pattern in stages 622 \nlength we observed.  623 \nThe spring cruise took place before the start of the phytoplankton bloom. At this time 624 \nC. finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus females had already emerged from diapause and they 625 \nwere actively reproducing on the shelves as indicated by the large number of adults, eggs and 626 \nnauplii found here compared to deeper areas (C. Castellani, personal observation). Although 627 \nC. finmarchicus may begin the spring spawning using its fat reserves, the spring 628 \nphytoplankton bloom is considered important for continued reproduction of this species 629 \n(Gislason, 2003). Since phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, were still relatively low in 630 \nabundance at the time of the spring survey it is possible that microplankton alone was not 631 \nsufficient to sustain Calanus spp. EPR. Based on energy budget considerations, Gislason 632 \n(Gislason, 2005) concluded that during spring the secondary production of C. finmarchicus 633 \naround Iceland was supported by heterotrophic feeding in addition to phytoplankton. 634 \nSimilarly, using a simulation model Carlotti and Slagstad (Carlotti and Slagstad, 1997) found 635 \nthat in the Greenland Sea C. hyperboreus would need to exploit the numerically abundant 636 \nmicrozooplankton and Oithona spp. to sustain its biomass.  637 \nThus, our results stress the role of the early naupliar stages of Oithona spp. as a food 638 \nsource for planktonic predators such as Calanus spp. and fish larvae particularly prior to the 639 \nspring phytoplankton bloom. Certainly, temperature and food availability are important 640 \nparameters determining changes in the natural progression of the life stages of copepods. 641 \nHowever, our findings suggest that future experimental and modeling studies should evaluate 642 \nthe importance of predation on the nauplii in shaping the temporal and spatial pattern in 643 \nabundance, stages composition and biomass not only of Oithona spp but also of other small 644 \ncopepod species. 645 \n 646 \nSummary and conclusions 647 \n 21\nThe present investigation has shown that over a wide hydrographically and 648 \nbiologically diverse scale Oithona spp. population structure, biomass and production are 649 \ncharacterised by both significant spatial and temporal variability. Compared to other oceanic 650 \nregions, the variation in biomass and life stages structure of Oithona spp., in the Irminger Sea 651 \nappeared to be controlled by temperature, food availability and possibly predation pressure. 652 \nOn the other hand, reproductive rates seemed mainly limited by food resources, female size 653 \nand sex ratio. Contrary to other copepod genus, in oceanic oligotrophic regions Oithona spp. 654 \nremains active, feeding and reproducing, during the whole year. Thus, during spring Oithona 655 \nspp. nauplii can represent a considerable proportion of the total zooplankton biomass and 656 \nproduction and may serve as a food source for larger predators such as Calanus spp. and fish 657 \nlarvae particularly prior to the spring phytoplankton bloom. 658 \n 659 \nAcknowledgments 660 \n 661 \nThis study was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NER\/T\/S\/2001\/00140) 662 \nto X.
