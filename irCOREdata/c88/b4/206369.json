Sustainable\nDevelopment, 1980\u201399\nIndra de Soysa and Eric Neumayer\nAbstract While many herald globalization\u2014the increasing interconnectedness\nof national economies\u2014to be associated with rising standards of living across the\nglobe, others fear its effects on sustainability+ Antiglobalization forces and environ-\nmentalists view these developments as a threat to the welfare of future generations\nbecause of profligate and excessive current consumption+ This study is the first to\nestimate the effects of dependence on trade, foreign direct investment ~FDI!, and an\nindex of economic freedom on the World Bank\u2019s measure of sustainability ~the gen-\nuine savings rate!, which measures the rate at which investment in the total stock of\nmanufactured, human, and natural capital exceeds its depreciation+ Contrary to pessi-\nmists\u2019 fears, our indicators of economic openness show positive effects on sustain-\nability, results that are robust to sample size, testing procedure, and several alternative\nspecifications+ The results support those who suggest that distorted economies tend\nto be both inefficient and damaging to future generations+ If increasing trade, FDI,\nand economic freedom are hallmarks of globalization, then worries about its effects\non future well-being are misplaced+\nAlthough many view growing economic interdependence as good for global pros-\nperity, others fear its effects on sustainability+1 The pessimists expect the fierce\ncompetition resulting from market globalization and enhanced economic freedom\nto push countries into unsustainable patterns of resource depletion and economic\nproduction, maximizing current profits at the expense of future welfare+2 Opti-\nmists, including most economists, argue instead that market globalization and eco-\nnomic freedom lead to a more efficient allocation of resources by enhancing the\nEqual authorship+ We are grateful to Erich Weede, Rick Auty, Simon Dietz, Paul Hensel,

examine the effects of openness to trade and foreign direct invest-\nment ~FDI! on an index of economic freedom on national genuine savings ~GS!\nrates ~adjusted net savings!, a broad indicator of ~weak! sustainability with wide\ncoverage spanning a period of twenty years+4 This index is a measure of the rate at\nwhich investment in manufactured, human, and natural capital exceeds its depre-\nciation+5 This measure is based on a widely held precept that sustainable develop-\nment is the ability to maintain ~increase! the aggregate value of manufactured,\nhuman, and natural capital, with natural capital being defined as anything in nature\nproviding value to human beings+6 Atkinson and Hamilton conclude a recent paper\nby suggesting that \u201cit would be interesting in future work to examine the determi-\nnants of the genuine savings rate+\u201d7 This is the first study to test the effects of\nmarket globalization and economic freedom on GS+ We find positive and statisti-\ncally significant effects that are robust toward a whole battery of sensitivity tests\nby way of different estimation techniques, inclusion of different control variables,\nand various subsamples of the data+\nToday, the World Bank and other organizations devoted to development distin-\nguish between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d growth+8 The World Bank\u2019s GS rate is a result of\nthis new thinking+ Because the assumption of this approach is that substitutability\nbetween various forms of capital is high, this measure is admittedly one that cap-\ntures \u201cweak sustainability+\u201d9 In contrast, strong sustainability is the view that all\nnatural capital should be kept intact and that substitutability between forms of\ncapital is not possible+ Strong sustainability arguments in the globalization debate,\nhowever, are less prevalent given the preoccupation of both the right and left with\nthe creation of jobs, economic growth, and concerns over relative economic well-\nbeing+ In fact, strong environmentalism, largely prevalent in developed countries,\nviews sustainable development to be a contradiction in terms+ One popular mea-\nsure of strong sustainability is the concept of ecological footprints ~EF!+ This con-\ncept relates to the amount of environmental resources, defined as the available\narea of land ~habitat!, required for sustaining the current levels of consumption as\nwell as for absorbing waste and pollution resulting from consumption+10 This con-\ncept gives little room for the substitution of environmental resources with manu-\nfactured capital, nor can it adequately account for trade as a substitute for scarcity+\n3+ See World Bank 1992; Pearce and Warford 1993; Neumayer 2002a; and Bhagwati 2004+\n4+ See Atkinson and Hamilton 2003; Hamilton 2001; and World Bank 1997+ The term \u201cgenuine\nsavings\u201d was coined by Kirk Hamilton and subsequently appears as \u201cnet adjusted savings\u201d in

better! water resources at their dis-\nposal than large resource wealthy states such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic\nof Congo, or Angola because human and manufactured capital compensate for nat-\nural resource scarcity+ In this article, we mainly focus on how increasing global-\nization determines a state\u2019s chances for achieving weak sustainability+ We believe\nthat any conception of sustainability must leave at least some room for substitut-\nability ~we do not think that universities should not be built if trees have to be\ndestroyed!+ Also, weak sustainability is a necessary condition for achieving strong\nsustainability+ In addition, we also briefly address the issue of strong sustainability+\nEstimating the effect of globalization and economic freedom on weak sustain-\nability is not just an academic question+ Policymakers at many levels seek to har-\nmonize urgent societal requirements, such as growth of income, employment, and\ngeneral well-being, while ensuring intra- and intergenerational equity+ Many rec-\nognize that current economic accounting does not fully reflect the trade-offs among\nvarious forms of capital+11 For example, economic rents derived from resource\nextraction and tree cutting do not fully represent income, in that part of the rents\nrepresent depreciation of the natural capital stock+ Similarly, economic develop-\nment that comes at the expense of environmental harm may reduce future well-\nbeing+ The green accounting program within economics seeks to value investment\nand depreciation of all forms of capital so that trade-offs among various forms of\ncapital can be better accounted for+ The maintenance of all forms of capital that\nare valuable for production and consumption is regarded as a desirable goal, a\nnotion widely accepted by the pioneers in the profession who seek to measure\nsustainability so as to translate knowledge into policy+12 This article is organized\nas follows: first, we examine arguments about globalization and economic sustain-\nability; next we examine the relevance of GS as an important empirical indicator\nmeasuring the concept of sustainability; then we present our results; and finally\nwe conclude+\nEconomic Openness and Sustainability\nThis study approaches the question of globalization and sustainability from a\nnational perspective by measuring the degree to which states are exposed to, or\nare connected with, the global economic system+ It is standard practice to measure\nglobalization as \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d through trade and FDI penetration+13 Accord-\ning to Mikesell, \u201c@A# comprehensive treatise on sustainable development should\nintegrate the macroeconomics of conventional development with the special con-\n11+ See Dasgupta 2001; and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003+\n12+ Pearce and Warford 1993+\n13+ See Birdsall and Lawrence 1999; and Nye and Donahue 2000+\nEffects of Economic Openness on Sustainable Development 733\ncern of natural resource sustainability and environmental protection+\u201d14 Our study\nattempts to address the concerns of conventional development economists, who\nsee globalization as a source of good because it promotes growth and develop-\nment, and environmental economists, who argue that globalization may promote\nprofligate patterns of production and consumption that comes at the expense of\nenvironmental harm and resource depletion+\nSupporters of globalization argue that greater interdependence between rich and\npoor states and the liberalization of markets from the clutches of profligate gov-\nernments will enhance wealth, increase efficiency, and destroy the barriers against\ninternational environmental cooperation+15 Trade liberalization is seen as promot-\ning economic growth,16 which in turn is regarded as beneficial to sustainability, at\nleast in the long run+17 Similarly, FDI is thought to supply poor countries with\nmarkets, transfer technology and capital, and above all, provide income growth,\nemployment, and poverty reduction+18 The theoretical argument on the beneficial\neffect of income growth on sustainability is that poverty supposedly pollutes and\nthat demand for environmental quality is a normal, if not luxury, good+ Poor peo-\nple degrade the environment by using slash-and-burn agriculture, employing out-\nmoded and inefficient production systems, remaining poor by being dependent on\nnatural resource exports, burning biomass that drives the greenhouse effect, and\nbeing highly dependent on burning fossil fuels for energy, particularly coal+ Demand\nfor and the economy\u2019s capacity to supply strict environmental regulation increases\nwith rising income+19 Empirically, economists have tried to demonstrate the link\nvia the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve ~EKC!+Accordingly, environmen-\ntal quality is expected to worsen with increasing income, but only initially, and\nthen improves after a certain threshold, computed by some to be around $5,000 to\n$8,000 per capita, depending on which pollutant one looks at+20\nIn addition to the income effect, trade and FDI allow the efficient allocation of\nresources across the world, where a country specializes in those activities it has an\nadvantage in so that countries with an abundance of one resource can trade with\nthose that are abundant in another, thereby achieving maximum output for a given\ninput\u2014in other words, movement toward sustainability because waste is mini-\n14+ Mikesell 1992, 141+\n15+ Some scholars estimate the impact of globalization on government spending to assess whether\ngovernments \u201crace to the bottom+\u201d Much evidence seems to suggest that governments adapt to the\nincreasing competition by compensating society with public goods, such as education+ See Adser\u00e0 and\nBoix 2002; Garrett 1998; and Rodrik 1996+\n16+ See Krueger 1998;

trade is also associated with getting prices right and ending\ndistortions, which enhances sustainability+ Governments are likely to subsidize eco-\nnomic activity for political reasons, thereby increasing waste, a policy that is highly\ncostly and becomes increasingly untenable the more exposed a country is to global\nmarkets+22 Economic openness is therefore often taken as a proxy for good eco-\nnomic policies+ Open trading regimes are also more amenable to spreading newer,\nbetter technologies faster than more closed regimes+23 Because environmentally\nfriendly production is likely to be lucrative as people value the environment more,\nsuch production technologies will be adopted faster where the market determines\nthe prices+ The adoption of such technologies across integrated space may lead to\nthe \u201cleveling up\u201d when laggards are forced by the market to standardize+24 Liber-\nals therefore conclude that autarkic policies and government-dominated markets\ncause high environmental damage and low output+ The experience of state plan-\nning exemplified by the former Soviet Union demonstrates that unsustainable man-\nagement of resources, inefficient economic production, and inadequate channels\nfor civil society to affect policies results in bad outcomes for people and the planet+25\nGlobalization critics therefore \u201cfight the wrong enemy+\u201d26\nFinally, while both camps recognize that protecting the global commons requires\nreal international cooperation, with some even calling for a World Environment\nOrganization to rival the World Trade Organization, free traders view the inter-\ndependence among countries as a potent driver of environmental cooperation+27\nCountries more open to trade are more likely to have signed and ratified important\nmultilateral environmental agreements+28 In this light, states that trade more with\neach other potentially have common cause and incentive to cooperate, an age old\nprecept articulated most thoroughly by such philosophers as Immanuel Kant,Mon-\ntesquieu, and the Manchester school+29\nCritics counter these arguments by stating that globalization exploits poor coun-\ntries and constrains the degree to which they are able to achieve sustainability+\nSome highly popularized, anecdotal and journalistic arguments suggest that global-\n21+ Brack 1995+\n22+ See Birdsall and

Antiglobalization activists successfully scuttled\nthe Multilateral Agreement on Investment ~MAI! on the basis that it would allow\ncorporations to destroy the global commons+ Giant corporations are accused of\n\u201cstealing\u201d the patrimony of the poor and the unborn for conspicuous consumption\nby the rich and globalization leads to cost-cutting, not efficient allocation of\nresources, and to downward pressure on environmental and social standards:31\nThe pursuit of high and rising consumption in the North and of development\nin the South have together led to the increasing exploitation of natural resources\nin unsustainable ways, often by TNC investment in resource-extractive indus-\ntries in developing countries+ + + + Policies focusing on liberalization, deregu-\nlation and export orientation respond to the logic of short-term profit\nmaximization and international competition that intensifies the need for cost-\ncutting+ The result is the rapacious exploitation and wasteful use of natural\nresources+32\nSome critics of globalization also assert that increasing trade and specialization\nmay work against efficiency viewed in terms of the dependent nature of most poor\ncountries on the export of primary commodities+ Increased trade may snare the\npoor countries in a \u201cspecialization trap\u201d that locks them into servicing a world\nmarket growing ever more hungry for resources+33 Others have argued that polit-\nical structures within countries favor capital at the expense of resource protection,\nwhich leads to the subsidization of foreign investors at the expense of sustain-\nability+34 More generally, critics of globalization argue that trade agreements bind\ncountries to standardized laws and regulations that will reduce the ability for gov-\nernments and societies to make autonomous decisions by addressing local prob-\nlems with local solutions+Moreover, critics argue that the systemic interdependence\ntakes away agency from governments of less developed countries ~LDCs!+ Greater\nintegration of developing countries in market relations diminishes their capacity\nto act independently, because those countries become locked in dependent rela-\ntions with the rich+ Countries more dependent on trade and investment are expected\nnot to be able to follow sustainable paths of development, because it would be\nagainst the interests of international capital+35\nMany pessimists argue that increasing income alone will not automatically take\ncare of environmental problems, because the level of income of many poor coun-\ntries is so low that increased consumption in rich areas will place too great a bur-\nden on an already overloaded planet, long before the poor get rich+36 In other words,\n30+ Brecher and

the effects of human\nactivity on the ecosystem, leading to collapse+37 Pessimists also contest the notion\nthat poverty pollutes more than wealth on grounds that the rich consume and waste\nmore+ In other words, the luxurious \u201cgreed\u201d of the rich cannot be compared with\nthe survival \u201cneeds\u201d of the poor+ These analysts suggest that increased trade will\naccentuate the profligacy of the already rich+ The rich will expand their consump-\ntion possibilities at the expense of the poor by displacing the environmental costs\non them+38 This proposition relates to what many term the \u201cpollution haven hypoth-\nesis,\u201d whereby polluting industries move from more stringent regulatory environ-\nments to lax ones+\nThe debate between defenders and critics of globalization mirrors older theoret-\nical splits in the social sciences, which pitted dependency0world systems theorists\nagainst liberals and modernization theorists concerning the fundamental nature of\nwhether or not closer contact between rich and poor results in exploitative out-\ncomes such as poverty, the export of pollution, and environmental degradation+39\nDependency theorists challenge the liberal view by arguing that international inter-\ndependence is neocolonialism, a system of exploitation, which leads to distorted\nLDC economies, lowered levels of democracy, and the breakdown of social rela-\ntions+40 They suggest that openness to the world economy leads to the \u201cdecapital-\nization\u201d of poor countries, because of the intensification of inappropriate\nconsumption, lowered domestic savings, and capital repatriation by foreign com-\npanies+41 These theorists also argue that free trade results in uneven development\nand a divided planet within which cooperation required for environmental protec-\ntion may not be forthcoming+42 Their exhortations are generally to find alternative\npaths to free-market capitalism+43 World-systems theory similarly views closer con-\ntact between rich and poor as a barrier against endogenously determined paths of\nprogress+44\nWe contend that the longer-term effects of market globalization and economic\nopenness on sustainability can be judged by examining the effects of trade depen-\ndence, dependence on FDI, and the level of economic freedom on patterns of sav-\nings of physical, human, and natural capital over time+45 This study asks to what\nextent globalization promotes or hinders the achievement of weak sustainability+\nIf globalization represents an extractive, exploitative,

Sustainability\nThere are several operational definitions of sustainable development and methods\nfor calculating measures and indexes of sustainability+46 This study\u2019s definition is\nclose to the sprit of the original, which is \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of\nthe present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their\nown needs+\u201d47 In other words, the steady depletion, or degradation of physical,\nnatural, or human capital without offsetting gains may be deemed unsustainable+\nAs some claim quite simply, savings of all forms of capital is the essence of\nsustainability+48\nUntil quite recently, economists viewed the growth of gross domestic product\n~GDP! as a measure of development+ GDP and the investment required for the\ngrowth of output were thought of as involving merely manufactured and, perhaps,\nhuman capital+ The degradation of natural capital in the process of economic activ-\nity was unaccounted in GDP statistics+ Green accounting processes began as an\nimportant corrective for making GDP reflect the degradation of the natural envi-\nronment as a consequence of economic production+ As a result, the World Bank\nembarked on estimating the \u201cWealth of Nations\u201d to include manufactured, human,\nand natural capital of countries as a first step toward monitoring the progress of\nnations in terms of sustainability+49 The changes in the redefined estimates of wealth,\ntherefore, indicate the sustainability0unsustainability of a development trajectory\nof any given country over time+ Importantly, however, these data also show that\nthe most important component of most nations\u2019 capital stocks is human capital\n~unfortunately, social capital is left out of the calculations because of the complex\nissues surrounding its measurability!+\nOur calculations based on these data reveal that the poorest countries have much\nnatural capital, but a relative lack of human capital+50 These data show that the\npoorest countries have roughly five times more natural capital in total wealth com-\n46+ Neumayer 2004+\n47+ World Commission on Environment and Development 1987, 89+\n48+ Atkinson et

values for total natural capital\ncomposed of cropland, land, pasture, timber, nontimber assets, protected areas, and all subsoil resources\n~minerals!+ Human capital is computed as the value of labor based on education and health, and man-\nufactured capital consists of man-made objects such as buildings, roads, ports etc+ The construction of\nthe data is explained in several studies ~Hamilton and

between\nrich and poor countries in per capita terms is natural wealth+ The share of the\npoorest countries\u2019 per capita natural wealth in the richest countries\u2019 total is roughly\n65 percent, even though they only have 2 percent of the per capita income+ Thus\nwhat the poor lack relative to the rich is not natural capital ~in per capita terms!,\nbut human and manufactured capital+\nThe importance of GS stems from its ability to indicate whether changes in the\ntotal capital stock are beneficial or detrimental to future well-being+ As Dasgupta\nhas written,\nGenuine investment is the social worth of net changes in an economy\u2019s cap-\nital assets+ It is a comprehensive notion, including as it does the social worth\nof net changes in manufactured and human capital, public knowledge, and\nnatural capital+ Thus, ensuring that social well-being is sustainable involves\ntaking care that the economy\u2019s assets are managed well+52\nThe GS rate, or genuine investment rate as Dasgupta prefers to call it, is one effort\nto estimate the sustainability path of nations based on how \u201cwell\u201d they manage\ntheir total capital stock+ How \u201cwell\u201d then is highly dependent on the environmen-\ntal costs based on damage to atmosphere\u2014by carbon dioxide ~CO2!\u2014and depre-\nciation of the natural resource stock ~forest, mineral, and energy stocks!+ While\nresource-wealthy countries, such as oil producers, would naturally have higher\ndepletion, policies governing the decisions to spend on education and other invest-\nments in capital may more than offset the given depletion+ Such countries, however,\nrarely make these forms of investment, which means that their future well-being\nis jeopardized by an unsustainable path of resource extraction+53\nWhile some argue about the exact method of calculating resource depletion and\nsome problematic assumptions surrounding the concept and its measurement,54\nthis study accepts the adequacy of the World Bank\u2019s method for current purposes+\nNaturally, scholars can further test the conflicting theories against better data as\nthey become available+ The multidimensionality of the measure of sustainability\nthat the GS rate presents, however, makes it an attractive choice for addressing\nthe larger issue of how globalization may influence well-being of nations over\ntime+ An additional advantage of this measure of sustainability is that it is widely\navailable in time-series format, is consistent with most orthodox views that see\neconomic activity requiring trade-offs, and is a measure policymakers readily under-\nstand and would be able to respond to meaningfully+55\n51+ The poorest countries are the World Bank\u2019s 2002 list of \u201clow income\u201d

2003+\nEffects of Economic Openness on Sustainable Development 739\nThe basic equation for calculating the GS rate is:\nGS \u0001 ~investment in manufactured capital\u0002 net foreign borrowing\n\u0003 net official transfers\u0002 depreciation of manufactured capital\n\u0003 current education expenditures\n\u0002 net depreciation of natural capital and\ncost of atmospheric pollution! 0 gross national income ~GNI!\nNote that investment in manufactured capital minus foreign borrowing plus net\nofficial transfers minus depreciation of manufactured capital is equal to net national\nsavings+ While the traditional national accounting treats government spending on\neducation as consumption, the adjusted savings treats it as investment+ This is\nregarded as a first approximation to the full value of human capital investment,\nwhich is difficult to measure precisely+ Depreciation of natural capital covers non-\nrenewable resource extraction, such as fossil fuels and minerals, as well as for-\nestry+ Cost of atmospheric pollution is approximated by the damage caused by\ncarbon dioxide emissions+ Detailed definitions of each item are provided in Appen-\ndix 1+ Investment in manufactured capital \u201canchors\u201d the GS rate as it forms the\nstarting point from which items are added and subtracted+Across countries, resource\ndepletion and investment in human capital represent the major correction compo-\nnents to net national savings, with the cost of atmospheric pollution playing a\nsmaller role+With a mean value of 2+88 percent of gross national income, resource\ndepletion is not quite as important on average as educational expenditures at 3+94\npercent+ Still, it is important given that the mean value of net national savings is\n8+87 percent+Also, its standard deviation is quite high ~4+85!, and for some resource-\nintensive countries, the resource depletion component can actually be almost as big\nas, or in many cases even bigger, than net national savings+ Appendix 2 lists each\ncountry\u2019s GS rates and its change, both averaged over the entire period of study+\nStatistical Methods and Data\nThis study employs a pooled, time-series, cross-section ~TSCS! data set+ The data\nare for roughly 135 countries, spanning twenty years+56 The data set is unbalanced\nand contains over 2,000 data points ~an average of about fifteen country-years!+\nThere are no clear models to guide the determinants of GS+ We control for the\nfollowing factors because of their connection to the main globalization variables\nand direct effects on the dependent variable+We account for important factors pre-\ndicting the gross savings rate, so as to control as fully as possible, but parsimoni-\n56+ They are taken from World

determinants of manufactured capital savings that may relate to GS\ndirectly and to our globalization variables+57 Note that fiscal policy variables such\nas government expenditures, tax revenues, and others cannot be included in the\nestimations because income minus private and government consumption expendi-\ntures is equal to investment, and they thus form part of GS+58 Their inclusion would\ntherefore effectively construct a partial identity between the left-hand side and the\nright-hand side of the equation+ The same argument applies to measures of public\ndebt since net foreign borrowing forms part of GS+\nOur measure of dependence on trade is total trade to GDP @~imports\u0003 exports!0\nGDP# +59 FDI dependence is calculated as the ratio of stock to GDP, obtained from\nthe United Nations, which is the most comprehensive data on the activities of multi-\nnational corporations ~MNCs! in poor countries+60 The stock of FDI is accumu-\nlated investment over time, which captures the structural power of MNCs over a\nhost economy to a greater degree than do FDI flows alone+61 Trade and FDI are\nlogged to reduce skewness+\nThe hypothesis of the supporters of globalization is that trade and investment\nopenness lead to \u201cgood\u201d economic, market-oriented policies+ Often, such open-\nness is used as an indirect proxy for such policies+ In addition, we also want to\ntest the impact of an admittedly subjective, but direct measure of good economic\npolicies, namely the Fraser Institute\u2019s index of economic freedom+62 It is made up\nof approximately thirty-five components of objective indicators capturing the extent\nof economic freedom within countries+ The index measures freedom of economic\nactivity according to the following criteria in quintiles since 1980:63\n1+ Size of government based on spending and the level of state ownership of\nenterprises+\n2+ Strength of legal system and sanctity of private property rights+\n3+ Access to sound money+\n4+ Freedom to exchange with foreigners+\n5+ The extent of regulation of economic activity+\n57+ We have largely relied on the World Bank\u2019s research program on savings

missing years for this variable are interpolated+ Because the score on eco-\nnomic freedom changes slowly between the five-year periods measured, the inter-\npolated values should not be problematic+ Strictly speaking, because economic\nfreedom has government size as one of its components, to some extent it also\nsuffers from the problem that its inclusion effectively constructs a partial identity\nbetween the left-hand side and right-hind side of the estimation ~see above!+ For-\ntunately, it is only one out of many components, which should mitigate the problem+\nAlthough openness to trade and FDI figure quite prominently in assessing eco-\nnomic freedom, they are but a small part of the overall measure+ The bivariate\ncorrelations between economic freedom and trade and FDI, nonetheless, are r \u0001\n0+36 and r \u0001 0+33, respectively+ Clearly, the indicator of economic freedom cap-\ntures aspects of open and market-oriented economic policies beyond what trade\nand FDI alone are able to capture+ Using the economic freedom measure as an\nadded factor in the globalization process has additional value in that much argu-\nmentation about globalization\u2019s effects on sustainability reflects fears about grow-\ning economic freedom at the expense of government\u2019s ability to regulate the market\nfor the sake of intergenerational equity+\nThe baseline model controls for level of per capita income because richer coun-\ntries have higher savings rates and supposedly exhibit better environmental stan-\ndards on several dimensions+64 GNI per capita in purchasing power parity is logged\nto account for its skewed distribution+ We also include a squared term to allow for\na diminishing effect of per capita income on sustainability+ In addition to income,\nwe follow others and account for the structure of production by including the per-\ncentage of GDP devoted to agriculture+65 We control for economic growth, because\nit is often thought that higher rates of growth require more intensive use of envi-\nronmental resources+ On the other hand, higher growth may enable increases in\nother forms of capital, such as manufactured and human capital that reduces the\ndirect dependence of people on natural resources+66\nSavings rates might be negatively affected if a country undergoes a financial\ncurrency crisis+ To control for this possibility we include a dummy variable+ This\nis set to 1 if, following Frankel and Rose, the local currency loses at least 25\npercent of its value and the change in the exchange rate exceeds the previous year\u2019s\nchange by at least 10 percent+67 The latter accounts for periods of high inflation+\nThe change in the exchange rate is defined as the change in the natural logarithm\nof the nominal bilateral dollar exchange rate+\nThe models include the degree to which countries are dependent on natural\nresource exports because resource depletion will be higher among these countries+\nAs the early studies of the GS data indicate, energy-rich states in particular tend\n64+ See Bhagwati 1999; Frankel 2003; Loayza, Schmidt-Hebbel, and Serven 2000; Ogaki, Ostry,\nand

literature+68 The resource curse is blamed on\neconomic, political, and social factors, all of which are possible avenues through\nwhich sustainability may be hampered+69 We control for resource dependence in\ntwo ways+ First, we test a discrete variable that takes the value of one if exports of\npetroleum are greater than 50 percent of GDP+ This measure is obtained from an\nindependent source+70 Secondly, we employ continuous measures for fuels and ores\nand mineral exports in total merchandise exports+71\nDemocracy, it is often argued, is good for environmental protection because it\nempowers people and provides channels through which governments can be influ-\nenced by civil society+72 Democracy also enhances international environmental coop-\neration+73 The rise of green movements, nongovernmental organizations, and other\nactivist movements within democracies is seen as proof of this+ Democracy also\nrelates to trade openness, with many arguing that democracy increases open-\nness+74 Moreover, democracy also affects the gross savings rate as politics drive\ntax policies and affect the issue of corruption and rent-seeking behavior+ We use\nthe standard Polity IV ~version 2! data+75 We subtract autocratic values from the\ndemocratic values and add 11 to create a scale from 1 to 21+We construct a dummy\nvariable for regime type by assigning the value 1 if democracy ranges from 16\u201321,\nand 0 if the values are between 1 and 15 ~autocracy!+ This variable correlates per-\nfectly with others who have used the Polity data in a similar manner+76\nIn addition, we include two further measures of governance as control vari-\nables+ One is the political constraints ~polcon! index developed by Henisz+77 He\nhas designed his index as an indicator of the ability of political institutions to\nmake credible commitments to an existing policy regime, which he argues is the\nmost relevant political variable of interest to investors+ Building on a simple spa-\ntial model of political interaction, the index makes use of the structure of govern-\nment in a given country and the political views represented by the different levels\nof government

Clearly, one obvious characteristic of the countries with\nvery low GS rates is that they are mostly natural resource\u2013intensive economies\n~this can also be clearly discerned from Figures 1 to

require that we abandon\nthe conviction that globalization lacks a human face, an assertion that is tanta-\nmount to a false alarm, and embrace the view that it has one+\u201d95 Our estimations\nsupport this view+ We examined the effects of trade, FDI, and economic freedom\non the World Bank\u2019s GS rate, one composite measure of ~weak! sustainability+\nThe logic of the measure is that sustainable development requires keeping net sav-\nings of all forms of capital that we value at least above zero, thus capturing the\ntrade-offs inherent in the accumulation of some forms of capital at the expense of\nothers+ Because even building a school requires the trade-off of land, trees, other\nresources, analyses of sustainable development have often failed to capture such\ndimensions in their operationalization+ Thus the question becomes under what con-\nditions countries transform natural resources, including clean air, into income sus-\ntainably+ Answering this question, our study gauged the effects of trade and FDI\ndependence and degree of economic freedom on the GS rate over a period of twenty\nyears+ Our results are easily summarized+\nTrade, FDI dependence, and economic freedom increase GS+ This runs counter\nto what some dependency and world system theorists have argued in terms of a\ncapitalist world system damaging the well-being of future generations+ This study\nfinds no such effect of globalization+ Countries that are more closely integrated\ninto world markets and that allow a greater degree of economic freedom protect\ntheir future well-being better than isolated countries that tightly restrict the free-\ndom of economic activity+Allegations that globalization induces countries to max-\nimize short-term benefits at the expense of mortgaging the future are therefore\nwithout foundation+\nA few country cases illustrate our main results+ Comparing the world situation\nin the first half of the 1980s to that of the second half of the 1990s, many coun-\ntries opened their economies and increased their GS rate substantially+ For exam-\nple, Chile and Ghana increased their share of trade to GDP by 14 and 64 percentage\npoints, their FDI stock relative to GDP by 30 and 8 percentage points, and their\nIndex of Economic Freedom by 2+4 and 2+8 points, respectively, while at the same\ntime increasing their GS rate by 22 and 9 percentage points, respectively+ Of course,\nnot all countries opened up trade and FDI and allowed more economic freedom\nall at the same rate+ China is a good example+ It increased its trade share by 25\npercentage points and its FDI stock relative to GDP by 21 percentage points, but\nits increase in economic freedom of merely 0+8 points is less impressive+ In the\nsame time span, the country managed to increase its GS rate by 24 percentage\npoints+ Inevitably, there are also some failures, representing exceptions to the gen-\neral trend+ For example, Nicaragua and the Democratic Republic of Congo were\nmuch more open in the late 1990s than in the early 1980s+ They increased their\n95+ Bhagwati 2004, 265 ~italics in original!+\n760 International Organization\ntrade share by 55 and 20 percentage points, their FDI share by 26 and 4 percent-\nage points, and their index of economic freedom by 2 and 0+6 points, respectively+\nYet, their GS rate dropped by 5 and 7 percentage points, respectively+ In future\nresearch, we would like to explore the reasons why some liberalizing countries\nfail to achieve increases in GS+\nAdmittedly, our results only hold for weak sustainability+ However, such sus-\ntainability is a prerequisite for achieving stronger forms of sustainability+ Also,\nwhile we have not been able to demonstrate a positive effect of globalization on\nstrong sustainability, of which ecological footprints represent a crude and con-\ntested measure, we have also not found any negative effect+ Clearly more research\nneeds to be done on the determinants of the GS rate beyond globalization con-\ncerns, so that econometric models might be refined over time+When stronger find-\nings from other variables can be incorporated, we will be able to test further the\npotential spuriousness of the association between trade, FDI, economic freedom,\nand sustainability reported here+\nThis caveat notwithstanding, our results taken together suggest that economic\nglobalization leads to better management of the wealth of nations, a good pros-\npect for the present generation and for those to whom we bequeath the planet+ On\nthe other hand, resource-wealthy countries seem to waste resources, given that\nthey fail to translate extraction of nature\u2019s wealth into sustainability via adequate\ninvestment in manufactured and human capital, presumably because of the well-\ndocumented feature of both economic and political \u201cDutch disease\u201d that often result\nin distorted markets, corruption, mal-governance, and social breakdown+\nMany developing countries have embarked on a policy reform toward eco-\nnomic openness in the last two decades or so+96 Whether this change is prompted\nby the spectacular failure of inward-looking and import-substituting economic pol-\nicies from previous decades97 is a consequence of the process of democratiza-\ntion98 or has other reasons altogether need not concern us here+ What is important\nis that, built on our estimations, the gradual adoption of open economic policies\neven in resource-wealthy regions, such as Africa, is good news for weak\nsustainability+\nAppendix
