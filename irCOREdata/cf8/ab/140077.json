Introduction \n \n1.1. Aim of the paper \nMicro-powder injection moulding (\u03bcPIM) is a developing micromoulding technology which is \nnow being used for the high-volume microfabrication of metal and ceramic components. However, \nunlike high-volume microfabrication processes, such as micro-polymer injection moulding (\u03bcIM) and \nmicro-hot embossing (\u03bcHE), aside from several brief process overviews it has yet to be systematically \nreviewed [1-3]. \n This review, therefore, covers major advances in \u03bcPIM since its early stages in the late nineties \n[4-9], when advances in micro-mould making techniques and dedicated micro-moulding equipment \nraised the possibility of micro-moulding of metals and ceramics. \n The aim of this paper is to review \u03bcPIM as a high-volume micro-manufacturing technique for \nthe production of metal and ceramic \u201cmicro-components\u201d, i.e. components which fall into one or more \nof the following three classes [10,11]: \n\uf0b7 Micro-parts: parts with a maximum size below 10 mm and features in the micron range [3]. \n2 \n \n\uf0b7 Microstructured parts: parts with dimensions between several millimetres and several centimetres \nwith three-dimensional microstructures located on one or more surface area [3,12]. \n\uf0b7 Micro-precision parts: parts of unlimited size, but with tolerances in the micron range or smaller \n[13]. \n \n1.2. Structure of the review \n\u03bcPIM generally follows a specific process chain in which a metal or ceramic powder is mixed \nwith a binder, the mix moulded, the binder removed and the powder then sintered (see Figure 1).  \nThese process steps have been used here as the central structure of the review.  Section 3 discusses \nfeedstock requirements for \u03bcPIM, Section 4 deals with mould-fabrication, Section 5 presents the \ninjection moulding of \u201cgreen compacts\u201d and Section 6 discusses debinding of micro-components.  \nSintering in \u03bcPIM is discussed in Section 7 and Section 8 presents inspection and metrology. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Process chain for \u03bcPIM. \n \nPowder \nBinder \nMixing \nMicro-injection Moulding Feedstock Preparation \nDebinding Sintering Inspection and Metrology \n3 \n \n Three further sections of this review cover: the design of parts for \u03bcPIM (Section 2), initial \nattempts at numerical simulation of the process (section 9) and process variants, such as two-\ncomponent \u03bcPIM (Section 10). \n It should be noted that in some sections of the review, information is adopted from other \ndomains, such as polymer micro-injection moulding (\u03bcIM), conventional injection moulding (IM) and \nconventional powder injection moulding (PIM). This is done where the state of the art in these \ndomains also represents what is currently known about \u03bcPIM.  This is predominantly the case for \n\u03bcPIM as a near-net-shape manufacturing technique and as a technique based on polymer flow.  \nTherefore out of domain information is presented concerning (a) design guidelines, e.g. mould \nfabrication (section 2), (b) processing steps, e.g. moulding and demoulding (section 4) and (c) flow \nproperties, e.g. rheological performance and micro-cavity filling (section 5).   \n \n2. Designing for \u03bcPIM of micro-components \nAs most of the reported work presents individual case studies that are intended for lab-based \nprototyping, no comprehensive design rules have been set yet for designing micro-components for \n\u03bcPIM. It is a common concern among several active groups in \u03bcPIM that design information is poorly \ndocumented and case studies are missing [3]. \nOn the other hand, being a net-shape process, several design guidelines for \u03bcPIM are similar in \nprinciple to other net-shape processes that involve shaping a defined volume of material inside a form. \nIt has therefore been suggested that, as a general design rule for conventional PIM, if a shape can be \nformed from plastic, then PIM is viable. This applies to design criteria of wall thickness, overall \ncomponent size, component weight, and internal cavity shape [14]. This assumption would also be \nvalid on the micro-scale, in the sense that design rules for \u03bcPIM are similar to that of \u03bcIM of \npolymers. \nGeneral design rules and restrictions for \u03bcPIM are essentially similar to those of polymer \u03bcIM, \nsuch as avoidance of closed cavities, undercuts and internal bores. Also design requirements are the \nsame, such as parting lines, gate design and ejectors location. Such generic rules can be found \nelsewhere [15]. \nThe following sections highlight design issues within the \u03bcPIM domain with respect to \nminimum feature dimensions, achievable aspect ratios and shape deformations. \n \n2.1. Mouldable dimensions and achievable aspect ratios \nIncreasing demands for relatively complex miniaturized components put extra requirements on \nmanufacturable geometries such as feature dimension and\/or aspect ratios (AR) - the ratio of feature \ndepth to width. Producing high AR structures by \u03bcPIM is affected by a number of factors, including \npowder size, binder system and mould quality [16]. Table 1 shows dimensions and aspect ratios \n4 \n \nachieved with \u03bcPIM experiments reported in the literature. This is shown in correlation to the category \nof micro-component produced, according to the definition used in Section 1.1. \n \nTable 1.

This is because most experiments are not directed towards producing \nspecific products but rather towards assessing the capabilities of the process itself using an array of \nmicrostructured geometries. In addition, microstructured substrates are relatively easier to produce and \nhandle, since the overall size of the component lies in the millimetre range. \nThe few micro-part examples are usually limited to micro-sized specimens or micro-gears. Gear \nstructures are sometimes classified as micro-precision components, since they require accurate \nalignment with other gears or components. Very little is available in the literature about achievable \ndimensional tolerances by \u03bcPIM, but typical reported tolerances are between \u00b10.2% and \u00b10.5% of \nnominal dimensions [3,40,41]. A recent study suggested that with thorough process optimisation \naccuracies of \u00b10.1% of the nominal dimension of some ceramic components could be reached in \ncertain directions of the final part [17,41]. \nAnother observation from the table is that, regardless of the category of micro-component \nproduced, smaller micro-feature dimensions are achievable for ceramics than for metals. This is \nbecause minimum feature dimensions are related to the feedstock powder size. A general rule for \n\u03bcPIM is that minimum feature sizes should be at least in the order of ten times the mean particle size, \nand if smaller features need to be produced then finer powders need to be used [1]. Since it is possible \nto obtain powder sizes for ceramics that are smaller than those generally achievable for metals, smaller \nfeature sizes for ceramics are achievable (more details about the effect of powder size are given in \nSection 3.2). \nThe table also shows a tendency for higher aspect ratios for metals than for ceramics. This is \npossibly because larger feature sizes for metals offer enough green strength that makes it possible to \nmould\/demould higher aspect ratio features. \nIt has been reported that currently, the maximum AR for \u03bcPIM is 10, where minimum structural \ndetails for metals are 10 \u03bcm and for ceramics 2 \u03bcm [13]. Some other references suggested that typical \nPIM applications with as high AR as 70 have been achieved [42,43]. With respect to minimum \n6 \n \ndimensions, the smallest dimensions that can be achieved are parts with thickness of 25-50 \u03bcm or \nminimum structural details of less than 10 \u03bcm [40,44]. \nMinimum part weight of \u03bcPIM components is decreasing with more miniaturisation achieved \nwith \u03bcPIM. Reported part weight of \u03bcPIM components was as small as 0.25 mg for LIGA-replicated \ngear wheels made of aluminium oxide [18]. For metals components, parts with weights of 7 mg were \nmade by \u03bcPIM of 17-4PH, and parts for human ear-bone replacement had the weight of 5.4 mg [1]. \n\u03bcPIM is relatively limited in terms of minimum feature sizes in the sub-millimetre range. This is \nbecause the particle size of the feedstock used determines the minimum mouldable dimensions. As \nfeature sizes decrease to 0.1 mm, the required particle size falls below 10 \u03bcm and only ceramics and \nstainless steel are available. Below this range, zirconia and alumina are the remaining candidates [44]. \nAs finer powders are currently being developed for metals and ceramics, it is likely that \u03bcPIM will \neventually reach smaller dimensions and higher aspect ratios. \n \n2.2. Mouldable shapes and geometries \n Very little is available in the literature about the relation between component geometry and \nfilling quality in \u03bcPIM. Most of the reported \u03bcPIM experiments focused on test-structures or \nprototypes for specific applications. Examples of the micro-part category include micro-gears of \ndifferent dimensions [19,39,45-47] and micro-dumbbell specimens [39,48]. Examples of micro-\nstructured substrates include nozzle structures [39,46], arrays of cylindrical columns [10,22,23,27,29], \narrays of micro channels [49,50] and microfluidic structures [1,19,26,51,52]. \n A few reported examples, however, aimed at understanding the effect of feature geometry on \nthe part quality in \u03bcPIM. In one experiment it was shown that bar structures are more stable during the \nejection step than round structures [19]. In another experiment, a number of geometries were moulded \nby \u03bcPIM and compared, such as cylinders, vertical bars and horizontal bars. The purpose was to check \nthe effect of feature geometry on achievable aspect ratios with respect to powder size. Several shapes \nwere also investigated with respect to polymer content in the binder for the achievable aspect ratio \n[20]. \nDifferent test geometries were also used to verify a computational approach of a simulation \ntechnique for \u03bcPIM. The test geometries were designed to study different effects that can occur during \ninjection moulding, such as bending bars, stepped cross section, diffusers and spiral shapes [53]. \nAnother \u03bcPIM simulation test implemented four different microfluidic geometries: plain plate, ribbed \nplate, slotted plate and plate with 250 \u03bcm deep channel [42] (more details about simulation of \u03bcPIM \nare given in Section 9). \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n2.3. Shape deformation in \u03bcPIM \n Within the process chain of \u03bcPIM, the three main processes of injection moulding, debinding \nand sintering take place in a high pressure and\/or high temperature environment. Therefore, significant \nvariation in some key parameters, such as volume and warpage, are expected [24]. \n With regards to part volume, dimensions typically decrease by about 2% after moulding, but \nsome reported research indicated the possibility of post-moulding dimensional decrease by \napproximately 6% [24]. Another 15% decrease in dimensions might result after sintering. Debinding \ndoes not affect dimensional shrinkage significantly due to the remaining binder acting as an adhesive \nfor the part structure [24]. \n These changes in dimensions during the process chain affect the overall volume of the produced \npart. Sintering is the most influential step in dimensional variation, which could reach between 14-\n22% [7,29,46] and up to 24% for some commercial feedstocks [39] (more details about sintering are in \nSection 7). Dimensional control in sintering of micro-miniature components is yet to be understood \n[3]. \nWith regards to warpage, an experiment has been reported in the literature were warpage was \nevaluated by measuring the curvature of the part profile [24]. The observed warpage was explained as \na result of residual stress and deformation due to demoulding friction between the microstructures and \nthe mould micro-cavities during demoulding. In another experiment, warpage was used as a \ncomparison factor between the quality of micro-mould inserts produced by \u03bcPIM and those produced \nby micro-milling [26]. \u03bcPIM was shown to produce higher degree of warpage relative to micro-milling \ndue to residual stresses during injection moulding.  It should be noted that warpage could also result \nfrom processing issues, such as uneven flow velocities during injection, or design issues, such as rapid \nchange in cross section [54]. \nDimensional changes are usually associated with densification. This affects not only the overall \ndimensions but also dimensional tolerances that are significant for microstructures [27]. In addition to \ndensification, some experiments suggest that dimensional changes also depend on the structure size, \nwhere shrinkage percent tends to increase when structural sizes reduces to 100 \u03bcm or below [55].  \nIt should also be noted that dimensional variability is affected by processing parameters such as \nholding pressure in the injection moulding step or heating rate in the sintering step [24] (more details \nabout the effect of process parameters are presented in the relevant sections about moulding, \ndebinding and sintering). It has been shown for \u03bcIM of polymers that process parameters affect not \nonly the filling quality of the parts but also the variability in the filling quality [56]. Since \u03bcPIM \ninvolves a relatively complex feedstock and more processing steps compared to \u03bcIM, it is likely that \nprocessing parameters would have more effect on variability in \u03bcPIM, a relationship that has not been \ninvestigated yet within the covered literature. \n \n \n8 \n \n3. Feedstock systems for \u03bcPIM \nA \u00b5PIM feedstock consists of the metal or ceramic in powder form and a binder system. The \npercentage volume of the binder present depends on its properties and those of the powder. Research \nin \u00b5PIM started with using commercially available feedstocks used for conventional PIM, but this \nresulted, in many cases, in defects and in poor shape retention of produced micro-components [1]. \nTherefore modified feedstock systems has been investigated for \u00b5PIM, with special focus on material \ntype, powder size, binder composition, mixing ratios and feedstock characterisation. \n The following sections review feedstock systems for \u00b5PIM in terms of powder material, powder \nloading and particle size, binder systems and feedstock characterisation. \n \n3.1. Material powders processed by \u00b5PIM \nSeveral metals and ceramics have been successfully used for \u03bcPIM. Table 2 presents a summary \nof reported metals and ceramics and their corresponding powder sizes.

Databases are \nusually consulted for failure conditions and relevant design properties to identify composition and \nproperty combinations [14]. \n Stainless steel 316L has been particularly used for microfluidic applications due to high-\ntemperature resistivity and chemical inertness [42]. Tungsten is used for \u03bcPIM for its high density, \nhigh thermal conductivity, high strength and yield point, high melting point and low thermal \nexpansion [40]. \n  Powder composition affects special properties that might be relevant to the component \napplication. Examples include magnetic characteristics, heat conductivity, thermal expansion and \nhardness [47]. Databases and standards for materials suitable for \u00b5PIM is not currently available, \nespecially for relevant properties such as particle size, impurity and agglomeration [3]. \n Ceramic powders, on the other hand, are easier to handle in \u00b5PIM compared to metallic \nmaterials, as the latter are often pyrophoric in the nanopowder size range [1]. In addition, because of \n10 \n \ntheir relatively lower thermal conductivity, ceramic-based feedstocks tend to less prematurely freeze \nduring injection moulding due to lower cooling rate [19]. \n \n3.2. Powder loading and particle size \n The powder content of the feedstock is an important factor in \u03bcPIM processing. Experiments \nsuggested that a polymer content of 50-55% was found to be suitable for good reproduction results, as \nit is a suitable compromise between shape retention and moulding viscosity [19,20,40]. Actual mixing \nratios are dependent on several factors, especially the filling behaviour of the feedstock during \nmoulding. \n Higher powder loading results in better shape retention, enhances sintering and minimizes \nshrinkage. However, beyond a certain powder volume percent, the feedstock will be difficult to mix \nand inhomogeneous, and the high viscosity of the melt would make it unsuitable for moulding [69]. \nLow powder loading, on the other hand, may result in powder-binder separation under high pressure \nduring processing [69], and may cause difficulties with sintering abilities and achievable densities \n[85]. It is usually favourable to maximize powder loading whilst keeping the feedstock viscosity as \nlow as possible [85]. \n In table 2, it is shown that for a particular material, different powder loadings can be used. For \nstainless steel 316L, for example, the powder volume loading has ranged between 50% to 65%. The \nrelatively high powder loading of 65% was achieved by mixing the powder with a wax-based binder \nusing a twin-screw extruder and was successfully used in replicating micro-structures [28]. \nBeside powder loading, and important factor in preparing the feedstock for \u03bcPIM is particle \nsize. Table 2 shows that for each material, several particle sizes have been used for \u00b5PIM. Early \nexperiments have been conducted with commercially available sizes, which are relatively large. \nSpecialized powders of relatively smaller sizes have been prepared and tested on a lab scale. \nThe importance of particle size lies in the fact that several quality parameters are affected by \npowder size either during the process chain or after the final product has been produced [35]. Some \naspects of design and processing controlled by powder size include: \n\uf0b7 Minimum thickness: Minimum feature dimensions should be at least 10-20 times the particle size \n[3,86]. \n\uf0b7 Sharpness of corners: Particle size limits the sharpness of all corners, since the particle radius is \nthe limiting edge radius [86]. \n\uf0b7 Replication accuracy: Particle size distribution has a significant influence on the accuracy of the \nreplicated structures [87]. Recommended ranges for \u00b5PIM are 1-5 \u00b5m for metals and 0.5 or less \nfor ceramics [7,35,40,46].  \n\uf0b7 Surface finish: Smaller powder sizes produce micro-structures with lower roughness values (a \ndetailed discussion about surface properties in \u00b5PIM components is in Section 7) [40,46,88]. \n11 \n \n\uf0b7 Shape deformation: Reported experiments showed that shrinkage of sintered parts is increased \nwith decreasing powder size [28]. \n \nDue to the significant effect of powder size on part quality, current research focuses on \ndeveloping powders with relatively small particle size and narrow distribution using techniques such \nas gas atomisation [1,7,13].  Nanopowder is a current area of investigation for \u00b5PIM [3,40,62], where \nIt is envisaged that developing nanopowders for \u00b5PIM would enable the replication of features below \n10 \u00b5m in size [59]. Smaller particle sizes have the advantages of providing smaller structural details, \ngiving fairly isotropic behaviour and producing better surface finish [62]. \nHowever, as the powder size decreases, other processing challenges are likely to appear. For \nexample, the melt viscosity of the feedstock increases with decreasing powder size until it is likely that \nthe feedstock becomes too viscous to mould [35,69]. In addition, some powders are too reactive to be \nproduced in sizes smaller than 1 \u00b5m (e.g. Ti) [1]. Another concern is the sintering stresses produced, \nas it is suggested that decreasing the particle size by a factor of 100 would increases the sintering \nstresses by the same factor [1,60]. Sintering stresses cause distortion in the component during \ndensification, which could be avoided by longer holding times for the stresses to relax before ramping \nup the temperature again [1]. Fine powders are also likely to lead to difficulties in attaining a high \npacking density because of particle agglomeration. The reduction of the size of the capillary pathways \nbetween particles may also slow down the debinding process [69]. \n Nevertheless, some nanopowders have already been developed and tested successfully on a lab \nscale. Spherical particles of nanopowder of 316L with average diameter of 100 nm are used in \u00b5PIM \nto produce micro-components [62,63]. Ceramic powders of 600 nm and smaller are used for \u00b5PIM \n[7,46,60]. W-Cu nanocomposite powder was also tested with \u03bcPIM [89]. \n Another area of investigation is the feasibility of using hybrid micro\/nano powders for \u03bcPIM. In \none experiment, a bi-modal powder feed stock was formed from micro- and nano particles of copper \nwith D50 of 7.8 \u03bcm and 130 nm, respectively [75]. Increasing the volume fraction of copper nano-\npowder led to a decrease in melt viscosity and an increase in grain growth of sintered parts. On the \nother hand, increasing the volume fraction of nanopowder from 0 to 50% led to a significant \ndeterioration in surface roughness (Ra) from 1-2 \u03bcm up to 3-4 \u03bcm and a decrease in tensile strength \nfrom 250 MPa down to 100-150 MPa. \n \n3.3 Binder systems \n Binder systems give fluidity to the feedstock and shape retention to the green part [83]. They are \nalso important for regulating the viscosity of the feedstock and, hence, ensuring defect-free processing \nduring \u00b5PIM. Binder systems usually consist of a major binder (usually a polymer), a minor binder \nand various processing aids, such as surface modifiers and plasticizers [63]. Surfactants are usually \n12 \n \nadded to binder systems to improve the binder properties such as surface wetting, spreading, \nadsorption and binder strengthening [69]. \n Basic requirements for binder systems include [5,21,31,39,62,85]: a relatively low viscosity to \nensure complete filling of mould micro-cavities, relatively high mechanical stability to ensure safe \ndemoulding, good shape retention and lower shrinkage during debinding and sintering. In addition, the \nbinder has to wet the powder particles completely to avoid agglomeration and shrinkage cavities. \nCommonly used binder systems include: polyolefin\/wax compounds and POM (polyacetal)-\nbased systems. The former has been used extensively (usually with LDPE or HDPE) for subsequent \nthermal debinding [7,10,22,29,29,46], whilst the latter has been used together with catalytic debinding \n[7,13,24,31,32,45,46,90] (debinding methods are discussed in detail in Section 6). Other debinding \nsystems have been used for \u00b5PIM on a smaller scale, such as PAN 250 (a patented binder) [16,29,33], \nPVA-based binders [33] and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate)-based binders [8,33]. Different binder \nsystems have been used in \u03bcPIM to produce all categories of micro-components, i.e. micro-part, \nmicro-structured parts and micro-precision parts. Within the reviewed literature, no specific preference \nfor binder selection is highlighted with respect to the category of component produced. \nSome binders are available commercially, whilst others are prepared on a lab scale. This is \nusually done by mixing powder with the binder system in small batches using a torque rheometer to \nevaluate the homogeneity of the mixture, which is measured by the stability of the mixture versus the \npowder content. Twin-screw compounders are then used to mix the feedstock [22,29]. \n Some research activities aim at developing binder systems with higher mechanical strength and \nstiffness for a better demoulding behaviour and higher achievable aspect ratio [18]. In addition, some \nresearch work focused on modifying binder systems by adding coarse polymeric spherical particles as \nsacrificial \u201cspacers\u201d inside the feedstock to control the porosity of the final sintered micro-component \n[91]. Another challenge under investigation is material homogeneity and its effect on binder\/powder \nseparation during micro-moulding [49]. \n \n3.4. Feedstock characterisation \n Characterising the feedstock is important in determining its applicability to micro-moulding in \nterms of flow behaviour and also the advised process conditions such as melt and mould temperatures. \nSimilar to pure polymers, \u03bcPIM feedstocks usually exhibit pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) flow \nbehaviour, where melt viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate, and the viscosity decreased with \nincreasing temperature [22,31,47,69,79]. \n Capillary rheometers are typically used to characterize the rheological performance of the \nfeedstock [22,31,50,53,61,69]. However, no information on the required sample size is given in the \nliterature.  In some cases, a rotational rheometer was used to examine the viscoelastic properties of \ndifferent binder systems for nanopowders by plotting the storage and loss moduli, G\u2019 and G\u2019\u2019, of \nfeedstocks [62,63]. For conventional PIM, it is recommended that melt viscosity of the feedstock \n13 \n \nshould be <1000 Pa.s for shear rate ranges between 100-1000 s\n-1\n [92]. Lower viscosity values are \nlikely to be desired for \u03bcPIM, since micro-cavities are more challenging to fill before premature \nfreezing takes place. \n Thermal properties of feedstocks are typically evaluated using DSC plots to determine the glass-\ntransition and the melt temperatures, Tg and Tm respectively for the feedstock. Thermogravimetric \ncalorimetry tests using TGA were used to determine the degradation temperature of the feedstock \n[12,22,23,31,47]. In \u03bcPIM, the melt temperatures are usually set safely above Tm and below the \ndegradation temperature, whilst the mould temperature is typically set below the Tg. \n Some other techniques were used to characterize feedstocks for different purposes. Examples \ninclude using laser-flash method to measure thermal diffusivity [29], using Sessile Drop Technique to \nmeasure contact angle and surface tension between the feedstock and mould material [53] and using a \nmelt-flow indexer to measure the melt-flow index (MFI) of the feedstock [35]. \n \n3.5. Outlook \n With regard to the future of \u03bcPIM feedstock systems, developments are expected in a number of \ndirections: \n- New materials are being developed for \u03bcPIM. Alloyed steels and non-oxide ceramic powders with \nmechanical strength and relatively high thermal conductivities are one example [18]. Copper, copper \nalloys and magnetic materials are also potential candidates [19]. \n- Low-viscosity feedstock systems are of particular interest for \u03bcPIM to improve the flow properties \nand, hence, the filling quality of the moulded components [69]. \n- Tailor-made feedstock with sub-micron or nano-range powder sizes would be an important \nimprovement for \u03bcPIM in terms of replication fidelity, dimensional accuracy and surface properties \n[1]. \n- Surface modification of powders is being investigated to produce a more homogeneous feedstock \nmixture and decrease debinding time [93]. \n- Environmentally-friendly binder systems, such as water-soluble binders, are being investigated. \nRecent experiments have demonstrated the use of hydrosoluble binder systems with \u03bcPIM of alumina \n[38]. \n \n4. Micromould manufacturing \nA number of manufacturing routes have been developed for micro-structuring mould inserts for \nmicro-moulding in general. Such manufacturing routes produce micro-structures with different \nproperties and limitations in terms of produced geometry, minimum dimensions, maximum aspect \nratios, resolution, surface roughness and typical insert materials. Table 3 summarizes basic properties \nfor common micro-manufacturing techniques compiled from different sources [94-98]. \n14 \n \nThe techniques shown in table 3 are generally used for producing moulds for different micro-\nmoulding process, such as \u03bcIM and \u03bcHE. They are listed, since no preferable methods have been \nspecifically recommended for \u03bcPIM moulds in the reviewed literature. In addition to common micro-\nmanufacturing methods mentioned in table 3, newly developed techniques for producing micro-\nmoulds have been demonstarted, such as micro-hot-embossing of metallic glasses [99]. \n \nTable 3.

LIGA has also been used a number of times as a possible techniques [7,18-20,28,46,70,90], \nparticularly for its relatively small surface roughness. \nOther techniques, such as micro-cutting processes [7,18-20,28], laser ablation [7,8,18-20,28] \nand \u03bcEDM [1,88] were used to produce mould inserts of steel, nickel or brass and aluminium alloys, \ndepending on the technique. UV photolithography of SU-8 has also been used for \u03bcPIM moulds [63]. \nAs seen from table 3, the category of micro-component produced might affect the selection of \nmould making technique. 2\u00bd-D features are typically common for micro-structured components, such \nas micro-column arrays or microfluidics, and in the literature these were usually replicated from \nmicro-moulds produced by silicon etching or LIGA. For micro-parts, the selection of the mould-\nmaking technique depends on the part geometry, where relatively complex geometries might require \nthe use the 3-D techniques such as micro-milling or \u03bc-EDM. Micro-precision components require \nmoulds that are produced with relatively high dimensional accuracy, where LIGA or etching \ntechniques would be necessary. \nSome modifications to the conventional mould design have been introduced to expand the \ncapabilities of moulds for microfabrication. Examples include the use of Variothermal systems \n15 \n \n[1,19,30,31,36,39,100] for complete filling of microfeatures and the so-called twisting tools [71] that \nare used for producing complex-shaped components. Another example is the integration of ultrasonic \nsensors onto the micromould insert for real-time process diagnosis of \u03bcPIM of ceramic components \n[101]. \nVery little is available in the literature about the effect of the feedstock on the tool tolerances in \na mass-manufacturing environment. This is likely to be a decisive factor when using \u03bcPIM for high-\nvolume production, since most of the primary micro-structuring techniques work with relatively soft \nmaterials [18]. It has been reported that nickel mould inserts could withstand more than five hundred \ninjection moulding cycles, mostly with automated machine operation without detecting wear \nphenomena in the nickel mould inserts [7,18]. A study on the wear behaviour of micro-moulds for \n\u03bcPIM reported that wear-resistance of micro-moulds is dependent on a number of factors, including \nhardness, surface condition, homogeneity of the mould insert material in addition to the characteristics \nof the feedstock [102]. \nRecent experiments have investigated the effect of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on the \nlifetime and replication quality of silicon micro-mould inserts [103-105]. Silicon micro-moulds coated \nwith nitrogen and nickel doped DLC (N:DLC:Ni) showed better replication quality and longer lifetime \nfrom 3-18 times during micro-hot-embossing of PMMA microfluidic features [105]. An improvement \nin lifetime was also witnessed in silicon micro-moulds coated with silicon- and nitrogen-doped DLC \n(Si-N-DLC) during micro-hot-embossing of cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) microfluidic features \n[104]. \nIn one experiment, the wear behaviour of mould inserts made of different steels, nickel and \nbrass was investigated after moulding with metal and ceramic feedstock [106]. It was shown that high \ninjection pressure and velocity during \u03bcPIM typically results in abrasive and\/or erosive wear of the \nmould insert. This is a potential research gap, as the demand for higher abrasion-resistant moulds \nincreases.  \nAnother ongoing development area is the development of tools for multi-material \u03bcPIM that \nallows two materials to be sequentially injected [40]. Automation of the \u03bcPIM process has also been \ninvestigated [107,108], which includes the automation of e.g. sprue separation and demoulding. \n \n5. Micro injection moulding \n Injection moulding is a challenging step in \u03bcPIM, since the quality of the produced \u201cgreen\u201d part \nhas a significant effect on the overall final quality of the part with respect to feature accuracy. A \nconsiderable amount of injection moulding know-how is already available for conventional (macro) \nmoulding of polymers [109,110] and powders [92]. On the micro-scale, injection moulding of \npolymers have also been reviewed in the literature [11,111]. This section aims, therefore, at presenting \nthe main challenges and major advances in the injection moulding stage of \u03bcPIM. \n16 \n \n One challenge in \u03bcPIM is the ability to completely fill micro-scale cavities [23,28], knowing \nthat the feedstock has a relatively high thermal conductivity, which leads to higher risk of premature \nfreezing of the feedstock during injection [1,19]. Another concern in micromoulding of powders is the \nejection (demoulding) of the green part, where micro-features are relatively fragile and might collapse \nor significantly deform during ejection [28]. \n Investigations of micro-moulding of powders focus on achieving the complete filling of the \nmould cavities by avoiding premature freezing or excessive filling. Filling quality in micro-moulding \ndepends on a number of factors, including the geometry of the cavity, the rheology of the feedstock \nand the process conditions. \n When it comes to the micro-component category, filling micro-structured components is \ndifferent from filling micro-parts or micro-precision parts due to the so-called \u201chesitation effect\u201d, \nwhich is also evident for \u03bcIM of polymers [112]. In this effect, the feedstock melt tends to flow more \neasily into mould cavities with relatively lower resistance areas, i.e. areas of greater cross section. \nThus, the melt tends to fill the relatively large substrate completely before entering the micro-\nstructured features (especially high-aspect-ratio structures). This results in premature freezing because \nthe filling time of the substrate is usually greater than the freezing time of the micro-feature. \n Two approaches are usually followed to ensure complete filling in \u03bcPIM: the first is to equip the \nmould with a heating system (known as Variothermal system) that keeps the mould temperature above \nthe Tg of the feedstock to ensure the flow of the melt into all cavities during injection. Upon complete \nfilling, the mould temperature is decreased rapidly to ejection temperature of the part [1,19,31,39]. \nThis approach has proved effective in the complete filling of micro-cavities, although it requires a \nmore sophisticated mould and a longer cycle time. \n The second approach is to optimize the process parameters of the injection moulding machine to \nachieve complete filling. This is usually done by adjusting the pressures and temperatures and\/or \nspeeds of melt flow throughout its path to fill the tiniest cavities in the mould. The common \noptimisation approach that has been reported in the literature is by changing one parameter at a time \nand studying its effect on part quality. \n In one experiment of micromoulding 316L, for example, increasing the mould temperature \nclose to the Tg of the feedstock was shown to be helpful in both replicating micro-features and \npreventing pull-of of features during ejection. Holding pressure, on the other hand, was shown to be \ninsignificant for filling quality [22]. In another experiment, complete filling of features with a 316L \nfeedstock was shown to be dependent on increasing injection pressure, mould temperature and holding \npressure, in addition to vacuum and Variothermal moulding conditions [31]. In a third experiment with \n316L feedstock, increasing both holding pressure and time in addition to mould temperature and \ninjection pressure was effective in mould filling [23]. \n There is a general agreement that an increase in mould temperature is significant in filling \nmicro-structures, since the feedstock viscosity decreases allowing an easier flow inside the tiny mould \n17 \n \ncavities. The discrepancies in determining the effect of other process parameters is typical for \u03bcPIM \nand was previously observed with \u03bcIM of polymers [11]. This is because the complete filling of \nmicro-cavities in polymer \u03bcIM is a factor of several parameters other than process parameters, such as \nthe material rheological properties and the geometry of the cavities [113]. This is likely to be the same \nfor \u03bcPIM, as experiments have already showed that binder composition has an effect on filling quality \nduring \u03bcPIM [33], an issue that needs further investigation. Powder filling is also a significant factor \nin complete mould filling, because the feedstock has a higher thermal conductivity relative to \npolymers. This results in a faster cooling and solidification of the green micro-structures, which makes \nincomplete filling highly likely [30]. \n Another major issue with optimising process conditions is the conventional method of varying \nprocess parameters one at a time, which is commonly used in industry. This approach requires \nrelatively long experimentation runs when many parameters are involved, and it does not take into \nconsideration possible interactions between different processing steps. \n The Design-of-Experiment (DOE) approach has, therefore, introduced as a statistical method for \nprocess optimisation [114] in \u03bcIM. Only recently \u03bcPIM experiments started to implement DOE in \nprocess optimisation [43,82,115]. \n \n6. Debinding \nDebinding is the longest step in the \u03bcPIM process chain, where important debinding parameters \ninclude heating rate, holding temperature and holding time. The boundary conditions on heating rate \nare associated with the a lack of economic feasible in a mass-manufacturing environment at the low \nrates, and high internal pressures potentially leading to cracking at high rates [47]. Three different \nmethods for debinding are currently under investigation [7,13,18,46,85]: \n(1) Debinding by thermal degradation and elimination of the organic components. \n(2) Solvent or catalytic debinding processes commonly used for polyacetal-based systems. \n(3) Debinding by supercritical carbon dioxide. \nThermal debinding is the most commonly used technique with \u03bcPIM, and it is typically used for \nfeedstocks with polyolefin\/wax debinders [46]. Several experiments have implemented the use of \nthermal debinding for \u03bcPIM to produce micro-components from 316L using multi-stage debinding \nschedules [10,12,22,25,29,33,35]. Debinding of stainless steel 17-4PH micro-dumbbells and micro-\ngears was also thermally conducted at 600\u00b0C in N2 environment [35,45]. The main limitation of \nthermal debinding is that it softens the polymer during debinding, which allows for motion that \ncontributes to dimensional variation [14]. \nCatalytic debinding, on the other hand, is based on hydrolysing the polymer into its monomer \ncomponents by acid catalysis, a direct solid-gas transition process that prevents the formation of liquid \nor softened phases, and, thus, prevents deformation of the green part due to gravity or stress relaxation \n18 \n \n[23,24,28,31,100,116-118]. It, therefore, is thought to result in higher dimensional accuracy, tighter \ntolerances and better surface finish relative to thermal debinding [14]. \nCommercial POM-based feedstock is currently available for catalytic debinding, such as the \nCatamold\u2122 family from BASF [119]. Ceramic microstructures were successfully debinded by \ncatalytic debinding of Catamold\u2122 TZP-A [39,90]. The main limitations of catalytic debinding is the \nuse of concentrated chemicals such as nitric acid for polymer hydrolysis and the production of toxic \ngases that, such as formaldehyde, need to be burnt out.  \n Supercritical debinding uses carbon dioxide under supercritical conditions in an autoclave that \nnormally operates at temperatures of more than 60\u00b0C and pressures of approximately 300 bar \n[7,8,120]. The process is still under development and a proper assessment of supercritical debinding in \n\u03bcPIM is not yet possible. Further modifications will be required to obtain an economically viable \nprocess [13]. \n It is known that debinding time is directly related to the square of the compact thickness [92], so \nmicro-components should have relatively shorter debinding time than larger (macro) components. \nHowever, no specific recommendation with this regard has been reported in the reviewed \u03bcPIM \nliterature. \n Different schedules have been reported in the literature for various debinding techniques and \ntypes of feedstock. Relatively fast heating rates during debinding was reported to result in defects such \nas blistering and bloating [26,34] or cracks that might result from pressure build-up and resulting \npressure gradients [78]. On the other hand, increasing heating rates during debinding was shown to \nimprove the surface finish of the component after subsequent sintering, and was shown to decrease the \nformation of oxides during debinding [12]. \n Since a binder system typically consists of different constituents, stepwise debinding is usually \nimplemented to accommodate each binder constituent [92]. It was recommended that for thermal \ndebinding, fast heating rates (10\u00b0C\/min) should be used up to a temperature near the melting point of \nthe binder system. As the binder components start to decompose, relatively slow heating rates \n(0.83\u00b0C\/min) should be used in order to prevent potential defects. Higher heating rates could be \nimplemented again once the pores are opened and channels are provided for the gas to escape [34]. \n Generally speaking, reported heating rates during debinding ranged between <1\u00b0C\/min [12,34] \nup to 7\u00b0C\/min [30,100] for 316L. For ceramics, reported heating rates for debinding ranged between \n2-5\u00b0C\/min for Alumina [78] and up to 10\u00b0C\/min for PZT [33].  \n \n7. Sintering \n Sintering is usually carried out in a conventional sintering furnace, where sintering takes place \nin cycles. The temperature is increased in stages, where a holding time is applied between each stage. \nThe holding time is used for induced stresses to relax before the temperature is ramped up again to \n19 \n \nanother stage and new stresses are induced. This process helps in avoiding distortions of micro-\ncomponents during densification [1]. \n During the final stage of sintering, densification and grain growth occur simultaneously [25,27]. \nDepending on the material systems, grain growth and densification take place via diffusion with \ndifferent sinks and sources for the vacancies [25]. \n Most reported sintering experiments and parameters of \u03bcPIM were conducted for 316L stainless \nsteel components in tube furnaces [22,23,29,33,35]. For ceramics, sintering can take place in air \n[7,13], whilst for metals sintering takes place under reducing N2\/H2 [13], H2 [7,13,51] or vacuum \n[23,29,31,51] atmospheres in order to prevent oxidation. \n Sintered components produced by \u03bcPIM achieve relatively good densities compared to the \ntheoretical densities of their material. For metal parts 95%-97% of the theoretical densities were \nreached, whilst for ceramic parts, 96%-99% of theoretical densities were reached [13,61]. Linear \nshrinkages of sintered parts are ranging from 15-22% depending on the composition of the feedstock \n[7,46,85]. \n In addition to shrinkage and density, sintering affects the surface roughness of the final part, \nsince roughness of sintered components is the highest surface roughness observed throughout the \nprocess chain [24]. Surface properties of sintered components have recently gained increasing \nattention in \u03bcPIM research for a number of reasons: \n- Tolerances of micro parts are decreasing towards the range of surface roughness [63]. \n- Surface forces become dominant at the surface-to-volume ratio encountered in micro parts. Such \nforces (e.g. friction, viscous drag and surface tension) are encountered, in particular, for applications \ninvolving fluid flow, surface reaction, wear and lubrication at the interface [10,12,63]. \n- Some applications of micro-parts have strict requirements on surface roughness that affect friction \nand wear at the interface [63]. \nTable 4 lists achieved surface roughness values for different metal and ceramic materials processed by \n\u03bcPIM. \n \nTable 4. Surface roughness values of sintered metals and ceramics produced by \u03bcPIM.

The best surface qualities \nobtained were Rmax = 2-3 \u03bcm with ultrafine ceramic powders [40]. Lower values of surface finish are \nlikely to be achieved as the \u03bcPIM process develops and feedstock systems with smaller particle sizes \nare introduced [3]. \n The surface roughness of the mould was shown to have a negligible influence on the surface \nquality of sintered components. In one experiment the surface roughness Ra of the mould, the green \nparts and the sintered parts were compared for different sintering conditions. It was shown that whilst \nthe roughness of the green part increased slightly compared to the mould roughness, the surface \nroughness values of the sintered part was orders of magnitude higher than the mould values [10]. \n How sintering conditions affect surface roughness is still under investigation. For example, the \neffect of sintering temperatures and times on the surface roughness of 316L microcomponents was \ninvestigated. Different temperature schedules were proposed and tested to achieve the best surface \nfinish for the features and substrates of a column array structure. It was found that Ra and grain size \nvalues for microstructures increased with increasing sintering temperature and time [10,27] (more \ndetails about surface roughness characterisation are found in Section 8.3). \n In addition to surface roughness, the effect of sintering on other quality parameters is also being \nexamined. For example, densification of micro-features was investigated for a micro-column array, \nwhere it was shown that after sintering, micro-size columns have larger grain size and lower porosity \ncompared to the larger substrate that carried the columns, which indicated that size reduction enhances \ndensification [25]. Other experiments focused on modelling sintering kinetics of micro-structures by \ncomparing different models [25,66]. It was shown that pores were eliminated and grain-growth \nincreased in addition to an increase in densification in the sintered part as the sintering time and \ntemperature increased [10,31]. \n Relevant to densification, the effect of sintering conditions on the formation of \u201cdense layers\u201d in \n\u03bcPIM was presented [27,29,65]. The outmost regions of the moulded micro-rods comprised a dense \n21 \n \nlayer virtually devoid of pores, which increased in thickness as the sintering temperature or time \nincreased. The dense layer was attributed to the use of fine powder size of 3 \u03bcm. The dense layer \ngrowth is formed by the ability of hydrogen to diffuse into the micro-size structures interstitially due \nto its small molecule. Hydrogen then reacts with the oxides that obstruct the formation of metallic \nbonds between the powder particle, and this reaction, hence, facilitates densification [27]. \n Whether the formation of a dense layer is observed for micro-scale structures only is still an \nissue of investigation. The formation of dense layers in micro-scale components was reported by one \nresearch group, and was observed for microstructures of the same general shape (arrays of columns) \nand same feedstock (316L) but different dimensions (column diameters between 60 and 100 \u03bcm) and \naspect ratios (between 2 and 3.18) [27,29,65]. It should be noted that a similar effect has been \nobserved for conventional PIM, where a dense skin layer is formed near the surface of the component \nand was attributed to heat conductivity differences between the surface and the interior of the \ncomponent [121]. For micro-components, however, the proposed cause of dense layers was related to \nthe ability of hydrogen to diffuse into the micro structures, as explained above, rather than differences \nin heat conductivity that were shown to be insignificant for micro-structures [27]. \n The relatively more porous core of the structures was thought to be due to failure of the \nhydrogen gas molecules to displace the internal gas trapped in the pores between the fine powders \nwhich would otherwise give way to the hydrogen molecules to effect densification. Virtually no pores \nexisted in the dense layer because of the shorter transport path that enabled the gas entrapped in the \ninterstices at the surface or immediately beneath the surface to diffuse out easily through the open \nporosity into the atmosphere. \n Several sintering temperatures were used to investigate their effect on dimensional accuracy of \n316L and 17-4PH stainless steel micro-components. Dimensional accuracy was represented by the \ncoefficient of value percent (CV%), which was defined as 100x(standard deviation\/average value). It \nwas shown that as sintering temperature increases from 1050\u00b0C to 1350\u00b0C, CV% is down to \napproximately 0.09% [35]. \n With regard to sintering heating rates, some experiments reported the range of heating rates \nused for e.g. 316L micro-components, which included 5\u00b0C\/min [26,67], 7\u00b0C\/min [30,31,100], \n10\u00b0C\/min [34] and up to 12\u00b0C [67]. Heating rates between 1-5\u00b0C\/min were also used for \u03bcPIM of \nzirconia [90]. Such heating rates are not particularly different from those typically used for sintering \nconventional (macro-) components [122]. \n A few experiments have investigated the effect of sintering heating rates on particular quality \nparameters. For example, it was show that during the \u03bcPIM of 316L, increasing the sintering heating \nrate from 5\u00b0C\/min up to 12\u00b0C\/min resulted in an increase in part shrinkage from approximately 12% \nto 15% and an increase in final density from 92% to 96% of the theoretical density [67,68]. In another \nexperiment with 316L, it was suggested that fast heating rates during sintering will result in a higher \n22 \n \namount of carbon that is kept in the sintered part, because sintering occurs before all of the organic \ncomponents have been removed from the part [31]. \n The effect of sintering heating rates was also investigated for catalytically debinded 316L \ncomponents, where the recommended sintering schedule starts at 600\u00b0C to remove potentially high \namounts of carbon that are left from the debinding process. After a holding time of 1 hour, the \ntemperature was increased to the normal sintering temperature range between 1200\u00b0C to 1300\u00b0C. \n Recent research work focused on applying alternative sintering techniques for micro-\ncomponents, such as spark plasma sintering (SPS) [77]. This technique enables rapid densification of \nmetal and ceramic powder components at low temperatures, which helps in controlling grain growth \nduring sintering. \n Very little is available in the literature about structured methods for optimising sintering process \nconditions for micro-components. The effect of sintering conditions on densification, surface \nproperties and mechanical properties is still in early stages. \n \n8. Inspection and metrology \n Considering the size of micro-components, assessing the quality of the produced parts depends \non the ability to measure relevant properties, such as dimensions, weights, roughness values or \nmechanical properties. Different techniques and instruments have been implemented to inspect micro-\nstructures produced by \u03bcPIM, but the need for specialized equipment for micro-components still \npersists. This section reviews some inspection methods used to assess different properties of powder \nmicro-components. \n \n8.1. Dimensions \nMeasuring dimensions is particularly important in inspecting \u03bcPIM features for evaluating the \nreplication fidelity of green parts and the overall shrinkage of the sintered part. Most reported \nexperiments in the literature were more concerned about the general shape morphology rather than \nmeasuring particular dimensions. This was done by using visual methods, such as light optical \nmicroscopy [24,29] and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [5,10,12,25-27,29,33,39]. \nSome experiments used the same techniques to evaluate shrinkage after sintering [22,29] or \nmeasure selected dimensions [24]. Other techniques, such as laser displacement sensing and digital \nimage analysis, were used to measure dimensions of micro-gears [45]. \n \n8.2. Grain growth \n Since the microstructure of \u03bcPIM components affects mechanical properties, evaluating \ndensification is of interest in quality assessment [27]. Grain size is measured using SEM [10] or \noptical microscopes [31]. A common standard technique to measure grain size is by following ASTM \n112-96 [123] using the outlined intercept procedure [10,25,27]. \n23 \n \nImage analysis software [25,27] is used to measure porosity and identifying dense layers of \n\u03bcPIM components after polishing substructures [27,29]. \n \n8.3. Surface roughness \n As highlighted previously in Section 7, surface properties of \u03bcPIM products are of considerable \nimportance for applications such as microfluidic channels. Different instruments were used to evaluate \nsurface roughness of sintered components. These include non-contact surface profilometers with \nvertical scanning interferometry [10,12], atomic force microscopy (AFM) or confocal laser scanning \nmicroscopy (CLSM) [10]. \n \n8.4. Mechanical properties \nStandard instruments are used to evaluate some mechanical properties, such as using nano-\nindenters to measure Young\u2019s modulus for 316L [31] or Vicker hardness [45]. Some specialized \ninstruments have been developed for measuring mechanical properties of \u03bcPIM components. For \nexample, micro-testing facilities have been developed which was equipped with micro-tensile and \nthree-point-bending testing units [2,67,124].  Also, micro-hardness measurements were made on the \npolished cross-sections of the sintered 316L microfeatures using a micro-hardness tester with a \nVickers indenter [29]. Residual stresses in zirconia specimens produced by \u03bcPIM were measured \nusing a diffractometer [125]. Further studies on investigating mechanical properties of \u03bcPIM \ncomponents could be found in the literature [126,127]. \n \n8.5. Other techniques \nIn addition to the inspection methods highlighted above, some other properties were of interest, \nsuch as part density or tribological behaviour. \nPart densities of metal and ceramic parts were measured using the Archimedes principle using \ndeionized water as the immersion medium [10,27,83], where weights were measured to 0.1 mg [10]. \nDensities of sintered micro-dumbbell specimens were measured using an electronic scale [35]. \nTribological behaviour of micro-moulded 316L was investigated. Typical applications are in \nmoving gears and in micro-moulds made by \u03bcPIM. Ball-on-disk tribometer with dry sliding contact \nwas used to assess Tribological properties [51]. \n \n9. Numerical simulation \n Numerical simulation of \u03bcPIM is gaining increased attention for a number of reasons, including \nthe ability to predict optimized process conditions, to estimate processing cycle time and \nmanufacturing bottlenecks [42] and to identify post-processing properties, such as residual stresses, \nmicrostructures or dimensional deformation. Therefore, ongoing work in simulation of \u03bcPIM focuses \non simulating the whole process chain including moulding, debinding and sintering [40]. \n24 \n \nSome commercial packages, such as MoldFlow\u00ae, have already been used for simulating \u03bcPIM \nof both micro-parts [49,50,70,71,79] and micro-structured components [49,50]. However, \ncommercially available simulation programs for macroscopic modelling seem to fail when it comes to \nthe prediction of the process in microscopic dimensions [53]. A common drawback in most of the \nsimulation tools is the use of single phase models for the description of the feedstock, which does not \nallow for the prediction of, e.g., segregation effects [53]. \nOther limitations of commercial packages include implementing of 2-D modelling rather than 3-\nD, neglecting physical effects, such as surface forces, that are significant on the micro-scale and \nneglecting significantly high-shear effects observed in micro-cavities. These challenges, in addition to \nthe multi-phase nature of the feedstock, require further development of simulation methods. \nA major challenge for commercial simulation packages is the ability to predict powder-binder \nsegregation [128]. Segregation usually happens during the mould-filling stage, and its effect is \namplified during the debinding and sintering stages causing a number of quality issues in the final \ncomponent, such as visual defects, porosity, non-uniform mechanical properties, warpage and cracks \n[128-131]. Since segregation is usually attributed to high shear rate gradient during injection moulding \n[49,128,130], this problem is likely to be more dominant during micro-moulding due to high-shear \nrates associated with flow in micro-scale cavities [132]. \nCommercial simulation packages, such as SIGMASOFT\u00ae [128], are currently being developed \nfor prediction of simulation for conventional PIM. It is, therefore, logical to assume that such packages \nare not adapted for feedstock performance in \u03bcPIM, and that includes prediction of segregation. \n Some research work is currently directed to developing simulation codes and packages suitable \nfor micro-moulding. PIMSolver\u00ae [133], for example, is a package that was used to study \u03bcPIM of \nmicrofluidic substrates. It was shown to slightly over-predicted the filling volume when compared to \nthe experimental result [42,43,115]. \nSome simulation approaches, such as Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), have been \ninvestigated and shown to be able to handle multi-phase systems. The DPD approach describes the \nform-filling process with respect to the interactions on a mesoscopic scale [53]. The finite element \nmethod was implemented to simulate the demoulding process during \u03bcPIM and to predict how \ndemoulding forces could be minimized [134]. A constitutive model was developed to predict \ndensification behaviour of microstructured components, taking into consideration variation in grain \nnumber during grain growth [135]. \nAnother simulation experiment relied on the DOE approach to investigate a number of process \nconditions in \u03bcPIM of 316L: filling time, switch-over point, injection temperature and mould wall \ntemperature [42,43,115]. As the part thickness was reduced, process variability increased, and the \nmould temperature became statistically significant in contributing to over 50% of the total variability \nof individual process related parameters. It was also shown that the difference in melt-front \ntemperature was the highest for the lowest thickness, which increased the possibility of residual \n25 \n \nstresses leading to warpage and cracking. The filling time was the major contributor to the maximum \nshear-rate irrespective of plate thickness [42,43]. The sintering stage in \u03bcPIM has also been simulated \nwith Abaqus\u00ae to estimate shrinkage in 316L specimens [136]. \nWith regard to simulation of feedstock segregation, there is a general agreement that for \nconventional PIM, simulation tools should be based on multiphase flow models in order to take care of \nthe heterogeneous behaviour of the feedstock and, hence, predict segregation [129,130,137-139]. This \nis likely to be required for developing simulation packages for \u03bcPIM, and this is why recent simulation \nattempts for \u03bcPIM relied on multiphase flow [68]. In addition to multiphase conditions, such packages \nshould take into consideration physical effects that are usually neglected in conventional packages but \nare likely to be significant on the micro scale, such as surface tension, wall-slip, capillary forces and \nmicro-scale rheology [140]. \nMore developments are required in simulation of \u03bcPIM, as existing simulations are not \nintegrated and rely on different simulation platforms, length scales, time scales and material data. \nThey are also not tested against experiments over robust range of conditions [3]. Models for debinding \nand sintering are also required in order to be able to accurately simulate all the stages of the process \nchain for \u03bcPIM. \n \n10. Variant Processes \n Variant micromoulding processes are currently being developed \u03bcPIM, were variant processes \nopen up opportunities in functional integration, multi-material components and micro-assembly. Most \nof reported experiments are limited to micro-parts rather than micro-structured components. For \nexample, two-component \u03bcPIM has been achieved by co-injection two different materials \n[17,19,41,58,66,70,80,88]. The process is being developed by adjusting chemical composition and \nparticle size distribution to reach similar shrinkage behaviour. \n A similar approach was used to assemble two components by co-injection moulding of two \nceramics powders (ZrO2 and Al203) [80] and metal (17-4PH) and ceramic (Al2O3) powders [40]. \nSuccessful combination of magnetic and non-magnetic materials has also been achieved [1]. \n Assembling micro-components is also being investigated during the sintering stage [19,21,80]. \nConnection between two 316L stainless steels was achieved during sintering, where two green parts \nwere placed on top of each other and debinded and sintered together [19]. \n Challenges for multi-component \u03bcPIM include, firstly, developing a suitable injection moulding \nprocess for a well defined interface. Secondly, the sintering process needs to be controlled such that it \nis suitable for sintering the two different materials simultaneously [1,141]. \n Another variant process for \u03bcPIM is a process that uses plastic sacrificial cores [28]. It has the \npotential to improve the filling, demoulding and handling, and to produce the tiny parts with three-\ndimensional complex shapes and fine structures [28]. \n26 \n \n In-mould labelling (IML) is another developing variant of \u03bcPIM, by which colour patterns or \nlateral structures could be generated on the surface of the \u03bcPIM component [17]. This is done by \ninserting a pre-fabricated foil insert inside the mould and overmoulding them with the feedstock. \n \n11. Discussion and outlook \n Section 11.1 highlights some of the application areas where \u03bcPIM has already been \nimplemented and the market potential of the process. Section 11.2 presents an overall assessment of \n\u03bcPIM as a microfabrication process of micro-components in terms of its main advantages and \nlimitations. Section 11.3 focuses on particular potential development areas of the process chain shown \nin Figure 1 and suggested research gaps. \n \n11.1 Applications and market potential \n\u03bcPIM has already been used in multiple industrial application areas.  These can be classified \ninto five main groupings, as shown in table 5 [1]: \n \nTable 5. Application areas of \u03bcPIM: Applications that are actually on the market are marked with \nasterisks. \nApplication Examples \nMicromechanical components \nCustom-designed micromechanical \ncompoenets or replacements for plastic parts \nto make use of properties of metals or \nceramics, such as mechanical strength, \ncorrosion resistance or high temperature \nperformance. \nMicro-gearbox and stepped-gear wheel structures \n[2,13,18,24,31,47]. \nMicro-mould inserts [19,26,55,142]. \nElectrodes for micro-EDM [19]. \nDivertors for power applications [73]. \n* Micro-components for cameras [1], e.g. by Taisei \nKogyo (www.taisei-kogyo.com) in Japan. \n* Clock parts, such as operating cams and weights \n[143] produced by e.g. Citizen \n(www.citizenwatch.com). \n* Printer components [143]. \nMicrosystem technologies \nThis market segment is dominated by silicon \ntechnologies, but there seems to be a portion \nof this market available for \u03bcPIM products as \nwell. \nNozzle structures using ceramic materials [13,18]. \nMicro-optical benches for communication systems \n[13,18]. \nOpto-electronic systems [3]. \nData-storage devices [3]. \nCommunication systems [3]. \n* Automotive systems [3], such as airbag components \n[143]. \nMicrofluidics and micro-reaction \ntechnologies \nHigh-temperature gas phase reactors or reactors for \nhighly corrosive media [1]. \nMicrofluidic devices for chemical and medical \napplications, such as micro-mixers and micro-heat \nexchangers [2,19,50,82,144]. \nMedical technology \nThere is request for biocompatible materials \nsuch as ceramics, stainless steel or titanium \nand reliable manufacturing technologies to \nSmall replacement bones [1,3]. \n* Micro-needles for selective nerve simulation [24,31]. \n* Dental instruments and medical biopsy tools \n[3,44,78]. \n27 \n \nproduce complex shaped medical \ncomponents. \nMinimally invasive surgical tools [3,50]. \nBiosensors \n \nThe microstructured surfaces of \u03bcPIM components are \nfunctionalized to react with specific biomolecules [1]. \n \n As can be observed form the table, industrial application areas cover all the categories of the \nmicro-components, i.e. micro-parts, micro-structured components and micro-precision components, \nwhich indicate the wide capabilities of the \u03bcPIM. That table shows also that typical application of \n\u03bcPIM components focus on niche areas were other microfabrication processes are not feasible in terms \nof functional requirements and\/or cost. \n Turning to future market potential, it should be noted that \u03bcPIM is already being used for \ncommercial products, such as those produced by Scholz, who provides solutions for miniaturized \nplastic gear drivers and micro-technology [1] and Kl\u00e4ger Spritzquss GmbH & Co who produces \nceramic components with complete solutions including mould construction and mould making [1]. \n Reports suggest that \u03bcPIM accesses about 10% of the microsystem market, because of its \ncompetitive costs and ability to form complex shapes [3]. \nMarket expansion of \u03bcPIM depends on the existence of applications, where other manufacturing \ntechniques cannot satisfy stringent requirements in terms of dimensions or tolerances within mass-\nmanufacturing or where they cannot do so as cheaply.  \n A potential obstacle to the further expansion of \u03bcPIM components would be the availability of \nspecialized feedstock materials.  Considering that material consumption for micro-components is \ntypically small, a case for investment in new feedstock production requires that low volumes of \nfeedstock sales can return that investment. \n \n11.2. Advantages and limitations of \u03bcPIM for micro-manufacturing \nBelow, a general assessment of the main advantages and limitations of \u03bcPIM is presented, \ndrawing on the detailed information of the previous sections throughout this review.  \n\u03bcPIM has a number of advantages as a micro-manufacturing techniques, which include \n[13,22,23,29,42]: \n\uf0b7 Shape complexity (3-D features relative to 2\u00bd-D features typical to silicon techniques) [3] and \naccurate replication of microstructures [2]. \n\uf0b7 Net-shape or near net-shape forming. PIM in general offers high material utilisation, where \nprobably 97% of the powder is delivered in final components [14,20,35,88]. \n\uf0b7 \u03bcPIM is applicable to several material functional classes. These include materials for magnetic, \nmechanical or electric properties, as well as for high wear resistances [7,10,43,47,57,60,145]. \n\uf0b7 \u03bcPIM increases the range of materials that can be used for microsystem applications, in \ncomparison with other techniques, such as micro cutting, laser ablation, silicon etching or LIGA \n28 \n \ntechnique, which are often limited in respect to processible materials and\/or to series production \n[5,13,19]. \n\uf0b7 \u03bcPIM is cost-effective for mass production relative to other micro-manufacturing techniques, \nsuch as micro-cutting, laser ablation, silicon etching and LIGA [1,2,19,31]. \n\uf0b7 For small series and prototyping, low-pressure PIM (L-PIM) can be implemented, where pressure \nvalues are limited to 0.1 to 1 MPa, and low-viscosity paraffin or wax is used instead of a high-\nviscosity polymeric binder [54,70]. \n\uf0b7 A considerable amount of know-how is already available from established PIM techniques [7,12]. \n \nOn the other hand, \u03bcPIM has also a number of limitations that need to be addressed: \n\uf0b7 Available commercial feedstocks are limited in powders with fine size distribution (particle size \nless than 5 \u03bcm) [19,22,31]. \n\uf0b7 The minimum feature size and surface roughness are limited relative to other micro-fabrication \ntechniques due to powder grain size (more details in following sections) [59]. \n\uf0b7 Relatively high investment costs are usually required, especially for mould fabrication. \n\uf0b7 Shape distortion and shrinkage due to debinding and sintering affect dimensional tolerances [59]. \n\uf0b7 The mechanical properties may suffer from the presence of pores or due to excessive grain \ngrowth during sintering [59]. \n\uf0b7 Cycle time is relatively long due to time consumed for debinding and sintering. \n\uf0b7 When replicating micro-parts, a significant amount of feedstock could be scrapped as the size of \nthe runner system become large relative to the part size. \nSection 11.3 presents a more detailed assessment of the process by presenting a brief evaluation \nof each of the process chain stages and possible areas of improvement. \n \n11.3. Challenges and research gaps \n In spite of the significant developments introduced into the field during the past decade, a \nnumber of challenges in different aspects of the process chain need to be addressed. This would enable \nthe expansion of market applications of \u03bcPIM in producing ceramic and metallic micro-components, \nand it would make transferring production from current manufacturing techniques to \u03bcPIM \nincreasingly economically feasible.  \n  \n11.3.1. Designing for \u03bcPIM. A fundamental requirement for manufacturability by \u03bcPIM is the ability \nto design the required part taking into consideration the advantages and limitations of the process. \nDesigning for \u03bcPIM has not been discussed enough in literature, because the majority of experiments \nfocus on producing relatively simple structures, basically 2\u00bd-D geometries, for prototyping purposes \n29 \n \nor proof of concept. Most of the demonstrated examples belong, therefore, to the category of micro-\nstructured components rather than micro-parts. \n In terms of geometrical limitations, it seems safe to assume that \u03bcPIM follows the same design \nrules for well established conventional injection moulding processes, such as mouldability and \ndemouldability requirements in terms of draft angles, undercuts and uniform cross sections. However, \ndesigning for \u03bcPIM should take into consideration minimum mouldable dimensions and achievable \naspect ratios, which are also limited by the powder size. In addition, sources of dimensional \ndeformation, such as densification and volume shrinkage of sintered parts affect the overall quality of \nthe part. \n The relation of these design considerations to factors including particle size, feedstock rheology \nand processing parameters is yet to be fully understood. Design rules need to be developed for \u03bcPIM \nin order to enable designers and engineers evaluate the feasibility of implementing \u03bcPIM for their \nspecific component. \n \n11.3.2. Feedstock systems. A number of metals and ceramics have successfully been implemented in \n\u03bcPIM. \u03bcPIM experiments were initially conducted using commercial feedstock developed for \nconventional PIM. However, it became apparent that specialized feedstock systems would be \nnecessary for \u03bcPIM due to the physical scale of the process. \n There is a general agreement among researchers that decreasing the particle size is becoming a \nnecessity for successful expansion of the \u03bcPIM technology. Sub-micron powders and nanopowders \nseems a natural option for \u03bcPIM to extend the range of achievable minimum dimensions and \nmaximum aspect ratios. Decreasing the particle size would also allow for better control of surface \nproperties that are a significant consideration on the micro-scale, for example for microfluidic \napplications. \n Decreasing the powder size, on the other hand, would require a compromise between feedstock \ncomposition and flow properties. Tailor-made feedstock for \u03bcPIM should take into consideration the \nrheological performance of the feedstock melt during injection moulding to ensure complete filling of \nmicro-features and, hence, accurate dimensional replication. \n In addition to powder size, the range of available metals and ceramics needs to be expanded \nbeyond the current available selection. Microsystem applications usually require specialized material \nproperties in terms of, for example, biocompatibility or magnetic properties. Such requirements should \nbe considered when developing feedstock for \u03bcPIM. \nSome other issues that need to be investigated with \u03bcPIM feedstock includes powder-binder \nseparation during moulding, and the need for standardized databases of \u03bcPIM material properties, \nwhich can be implemented in numerical simulations [3]. \n \n30 \n \n11.3.3. Mould fabrication. Mould fabrication techniques have developed significantly during the past \nyears through the introduction of novel micro-fabrication technologies. Micro-structured mould inserts \nare already being produced for \u03bcIM and \u03bcHE of polymers on a commercial scale. \n Each micro-fabrication technique has limitations in terms of material, dimensions, roughness \nand aspect ratio, which puts some limitations on the mould manufacturing route for a specific \ncomponent. This has been tackled by adopting hybrid manufacturing routes, where more than one \nmanufacturing method are implemented to produce the mould inserts. \n Variothermal moulds have been successfully implemented in \u03bcPIM to achieve complete filling. \nSpecialized moulds are also being developed for multi-material injection moulding by \u03bcPIM and \nmoulding of geometrically complex shapes. \n Some research areas need further investigation, such as the effect of the surface properties of the \nmould on the surface properties of the sintered component. Another issue is how to assess the life \nexpectancy of the mould insert relative to the feedstock material and the number of cycles in a mass-\nfabrication environment. \n \n11.3.4. Injection moulding. Very little is discussed in the literature about the effect of the injection \nmoulding step on part quality. Reported data are usually specific for a particular \u03bcPIM application and \nthorough understanding of the process is not usually presented. \n The relationship between process parameters and part quality in terms of, for example, \ndimensions, part weight, surface finish, process variability and generation of weld lines is still to be \ninvestigated for \u03bcPIM. In addition, the effect of the feedstock composition, rheological performance \nand process parameters have not been given enough attention in the literature. \n \n11.3.5. Debinding. Several debinding techniques have been developed for different types of feedstock \nsystems. Thermal debinding is widely used for \u03bcPIM applications followed by catalytic debinding. \nThe latter produces more accurate tolerances and shape retention, but it requires specialized ovens \nequipped for handling concentrated acids and toxic gases. \n The relation between debinding parameters\/schedules and part quality needs further \ninvestigation. Relevant issues include the handling of nanoscale pores and particle contamination \nproduced during debinding [3]. \n \n11.3.6. Sintering. Research in sintering \u03bcPIM components has focused on densification, porosity, \ndimensional deformation and surface finish. Models are currently being developed to predict grain-\ngrowth during \u03bcPIM sintering. This included the effect of process conditions on the generation of \ndense layers and the overall surface properties of sintered components. \n31 \n \n Surface roughness values of a few hundred nanometres have been reached in \u03bcPIM. Research \nhas focused on understanding the effect of process condition on sintered part quality, but reliable \nqualitative data are still missing, and this area needs further investigation. \n \n11.3.7. Testing and inspection.  Standard testing and inspection techniques have been used to assess \nthe quality of \u03bcPIM components. Most of the used techniques rely on optical systems, which are \nuseful for visualisation purposes but limited in terms of measurement capabilities. A significant \nchallenge in testing and inspection arises because most measuring systems are not suitable for parts of \nthe size produced by \u03bcPIM, and standard measurement procedures are yet to be defined [37]. \n Reliable quality control of micro-components would require the development of specialized \nequipment to evaluate party quality in terms of dimensions or part weight. Micro-coordinate \nmeasurement machines (\u03bc-CMM), for example, have been used in \u03bcIM of polymers for relatively \naccurate dimensional measurements, and may also be a viable option for \u03bcPIM components. \nThere is a need for automated testing and inspection techniques, and a public repository is \nneeded for the properties of common materials processed by \u03bcPIM techniques [3]. \n \n11.3.8. Simulation. Some simulation experiments have been demonstrated for \u03bcPIM applications.  \nThose using commercial simulation packages show that they tend to over-predict filling in \u03bcPIM. \nSimulation on the micro-scale needs to take into consideration the effect of, for example, surface \nforces, surface-to-volume ratio and other relevant size issues. Powder-binder segregation is also an \nimportant issue that is not fully address in simulation packages for \u03bcPIM. \n Models are currently being developed to account for different stages of the \u03bcPIM process chain. \nThis topic is still being investigated, since no effective model is currently reliable for \u03bcPIM. The lack \nof standardized material properties also presents a challenge for the development of reliable simulation \nprograms that take into consideration multi-phase flow on the micro-scale. \n \n11.3.9. Variant processes. Extending the capabilities of the current \u03bcPIM process beyond its \nlimitations would enable new applications. The increasing complexity of current microsystem \ntechnologies poses more demands in terms of functionality integration, multi-material structures and \n3-D complex geometries. \n Variant processes, already showing success in \u03bcIM, are likely to expand the range of \u03bcPIM \ncapabilities. 2-component moulding, micro-overmoulding, lost-core technology and similar variants \nare examples of potential research areas that would enable combining structural complexity with the \nhigh-volume capabilities of \u03bcPIM. \n \n \n \n32 \n \n12. Conclusion \n This paper aimed at assessing \u03bcPIM as a microfabrication technology taking into consideration \nrecent development and state-of-the-art technology. The reviewed research activities illustrate an \nincreasing implementation of the process in different areas including commercial products. \n A number of challenges, however, need to be addressed in order to improve confidence in the \neconomic feasibility of changing to \u03bcPIM from another manufacturing technology or justifying basing \na new process on \u03bcPIM.  \n Design rules and considerations, feedstock range and particle size, injection moulding control \nand optimisation, debinding and sintering parameters are key areas of investigation. In addition, \nspecialized inspection techniques and reliable simulation models are necessary for quality control \nconsiderations. Finally, expanding the capabilities of \u03bcPIM by investigating variant processes would \nbe important for meeting increasing demands of the microsystems market in terms of functional \nintegration and structural complexity. \n Addressing the above issues in addition to finding new microsystem applications for \u03bcPIM \nwould create a market demand for the technology helping it to evolve into a well-established, high-\nvolume micro-manufacturing method. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Petzoldt F 2008 Micro powder injection moulding \u2013 challenges and opportunities Powder Injection \nMoulding Int. 2 37-42 \n[2] Yin H, Jia C and Qu X 2008 Micro powder injection molding - large scale production technology \nfor micro-sized components.
