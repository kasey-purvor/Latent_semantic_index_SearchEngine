INTRODUCTION\nThe control of energy transfer in macromolecular archi-\ntectures such as organic polymers, chromophore assemblies,\nand dendrimers is a major goal toward possible applications\nin light harvesting. Organic dendrimers1 have shown great\npromise for energy funneling processes as well as several\nother possible applications including light emitting\ndiodes,2\u20135 solid-state organic laser devices,6 new nanocom-\nposite materials7 and artificial light-harvesting systems.8\nThese applications, and the fundamental physics and chem-\nistry behind novel dendritic macromolecular architectures,\nhave motivated the investigation of the mechanisms involved\nin the energy transfer processes in novel organic\ndendrimers.7\u201312 There has been a widespread interest in the\nresearch to mimic the natural photosynthesis process. Natu-\nral photosynthetic systems have been investigated for their\nlight harvesting properties by a variety of methods. Several\nresearch groups have contributed to the vast amount of in-\nformation known about particular natural light harvesting\nsystems that have been shown to harvest absorbed light over\nnanometer distances with very high efficiencies.13\u201316 Organic\ndendrimers are a keen artificial architectural choice for di-\nrected energy transduction due to their well-defined struc-\ntures and synthetic ease. Linear chain polymers are limited in\nthis regard due to their flexibility and strong interchain\ninteractions.17 These interactions may result in a strong fluo-\nrescence quenching at defect sites as well as in the formation\nof excimers, which may trap the energy at a particular site,\ninterrupting the energy transfer process to the core.\nArtificial light harvesting systems such as dendrimers\nhave already shown ~in part! similar qualities as their photo-\nsynthetic counterparts.6,17\u201322 Critical works by Aida,19,21\nMoore,20,22 and Frechet6 have provided the synthetic basis\nfor the development of useful dendritic architectures for ef-\nficient energy transfer. Aida\u2019s dendrimer system ~a poly-\n~aryl!ether! harvests low-energy photons and transfers the\nenergy to an azobenzene core.21 Moore\u2019s system is based on\nphenylacetylene dendrons and shows an energy \u2018\u2018cascade\u2019\u2019\nfrom the dendrons to a lone perylene chromophore at the\nfocal point.20 Frechet has developed the approach of using\nlaser-dye functionalized dendrimers incorporating highly\nfluorescent, soluble chromophores into a well-defined mac-\nromolecular array.6 Nearly quantitative through-space energy\ntransfer from the dendrimer periphery to its core was dem-\nonstrated by this approach with an appropriate choice of\nchromophores. From these studies, and others, it appears that\nan important issue in the efficient energy transfer in organic\ndendrimer architectures in the role of delocalized exciteda!Electronic mail: tgoodson@chem.wayne.edu\nJOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 116, NUMBER 20 22 MAY 2002\n88930021-9606\/2002\/116(20)\/8893\/11\/$19.00 \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

There have also\nbeen reports of more detailed calculations of the linear opti-\ncal properties in dendrimer architectures. Mukamel et al.11\nhas utilized the collective electronic oscillator method to\nconstruct an effective Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian for con-\njugated dendrimers with fractal geometry. For the pheny-\nlacetlylene dendrimer system it was found that the linear\noptical response was dominated by localized excitons be-\nlonging to the periphery. The calculations showed that the\nmolecule might be viewed as a weakly interacting ensemble\nof nearest neighbor, two-level chromophores.11,12\nThe excitation energy transfer rates in dendrimers ~from\ndendrons to the core! may be estimated using either ~or both\nas in this report! steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence\ndata. Kopelman et al.22,27 has demonstrated the correlation\nbetween the molecular geometry and the electronic proper-\nties utilizing a phenylacetylene dendrimer system. The re-\nsults of steady state measurements for this system showed\nthat the energy transfer efficiency increased with the genera-\ntion number. It was also found that excitation transfer to the\ncore decreased for generations higher than the sixth. Fleming\net al.6 have utilized both methods to obtain energy transfer\nrates for the laser-dye system mentioned above.6 The steady-\nstate method may have several difficulties due to the correc-\ntions needed for the excitation spectra. The very large effi-\nciencies reported could be prone to moderate levels of error\nfor this reason, and this method may not be used alone for\nthe calculation of the energy transfer rate. Moore et al. has\ncalculated the energy transfer rates using both steady-state\nspectra and time-resolved fluorescence.20 The singlet\u2013singlet\nenergy transfer efficiency for one of the dendrimer systems\nwas found to be 54% when the corrections for the excitation\nspectra where taken into account. In Moore\u2019s system it was\nalso seen that the energy transfer efficiency decreased with\nincreased generation. This was explained in the context of\nthe Fo\u00a8rster energy transfer theory.\nThere have been several reports that have not only in-\nvestigated the energy transfer parameters, but also the nature\nof intermolecular interaction in dendrimer structures. De-\nSchryver et al. has studied a multichromophore dendrimer\nsystem which suggest the occurrence of intermolecular inter-\nactions among the chromophores within the dendritic\nstructure.28 There results also suggested the presence of ex-\ncimerlike intermolecular quenching and aggregation. Meijer\net al. has investigated a novel multiporphyrin dendrimer sys-\ntem in a glass environment using time-resolved fluorescence\nspectroscopy.29 Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy mea-\nsurements were performed for a range of porphyrin den-\ndrimer system of different spherical sizes. While the first\ngeneration system, again, agreed well with the Fo\u00a8rster-type\nenergy transfer between all porphyrin chromophores in the\ndendrimer, the result with a higher generation dendrimer sug-\ngested that the energy transfer was confined to only the por-\nphyrins contained in one dendron.29 The use of fluorescence\nanisotropy has also been shown to be instrumental in locat-\ning the position of energy transfer in dendrimer solutions.\nThe time scale of this depolarization can be correlated with\nthe excitation energy redistribution rate between the\nbranches as this process is accompanied by the reorientation\nof the transition dipole moment. The fluorescence anisotropy\ndynamics combined with the isotropic time resolved and\nsteady state spectroscopy may yield information about the\ninterchromophore energy transfer character.30\u201334 For ex-\nample, there is a possibility of energy hopping from one\ndonor to another along the dendrimer periphery. This may be\ninferred as an incoherent process and it will have a particular\ntime constant and \u2018\u2018hopping\u2019\u2019 distance that may be reflected\nin the depolarization rate.32 Also, for delocalized excited\nstates the energy transfer may be inferred as a coherent pro-\ncess and will have its own particular parameters that can be\nrelated to the depolarization rate.30,31,33 Finally, for the case\nof no energy migration ~or intermolecular interaction! the\ndepolarization rate should follow the rotational diffusion of\nthe dendrimer molecule in solution, which is relatively long\nfor large molecules.35\nSimilar to the approach often taken in describing the\ndynamics of photosynthetic systems, the coherence of exci-\ntation in dendrimers can be analyzed by the two limiting\ncases of Fo\u00a8rster transfer and that of completely delocalized\nexcitonic states. The bridge between the two limiting cases is\na parameter that describes the interaction energy ~J! divided\nby the homogeneous linewidth G. If dipole\u2013dipole nearest\nneighbor interactions are considered the molecular system\ncan be described by the interacting Hamiltonian given by\nHT5H01Hi1Vex\u2013ph1Hph ,\n~1!\nH01Hi5(\ni\nhv iui&^iu1\n1\n2 (i\u00de j J i j~ ui&^ j u1u j&^iu!,\nwhere ui& and u j& denote electronic states in which molecule\ni ~or j! is excited. The first term in Eq. ~1! corresponds to the\ntransition energies of the molecules. The second term is the\ninteraction term, where interactions can be transferred from\nmolecule i to another molecule j. The third term is the\nexciton\u2013phonon interaction term. The last term is the photon\nHamiltonian. Leegwater31 has considered the extent of delo-\ncalization theoretically by utilizing a Green\u2019s function ap-\nproach as a function of electronic coupling and the homoge-\nneous linewidth. This formalism is approximated in the high\ntemperature limit, which is associated with an extremely\nshort phonon correlation time. In spite of the last limitation\n~high temperature! the analytical results can be used for a\nqualitative description of the energy migration process.\nWhile this model contains interesting aspects of coherence in\naggregated systems, its relationship to the fluorescence depo-\n8894 J.

It has been found that the depolarization\ntime tdep can be described by31\ntdep5\n1\nG\n1\n~12G0T !\n, ~2!\nwhere\nG0T5\n1\nN (k51\nN\nG2\nG2116J2 sin2~2p\/N !sin2~2pk\/N ! .\nIn this equation J is the nearest neighbor interaction, G is the\nhomogeneous linewidth, N is the number of chromophores,\nand G0T is the product of noninteracting Green function and\nT matrix.31 This relatively simple model does not take into\naccount inhomogeneous broadening.31 At the same time for\nsmall dendrimer molecules, which have been synthesized us-\ning very defined synthesis routes,18 we do not expect a large\nstatic chromophore disorder such as that for pigments in\nnatural light harvesting photosynthetic systems.13\u201315 And\nhere, we will use this analytical model to describe qualita-\ntively the fast depolarization of emission in organic dendrim-\ners.\nIn this paper the photophysics of the A-DSB stilbene\ndendrimer system is reported. The steady-state absorption,\nemission, and excitation spectra are given to estimate the\nenergy transfer efficiency in the dendrimer systems. The\nA-DSB systems were originally synthesized for light emit-\nting diode applications,3\u20135 and the detailed measurements of\ntheir electroluminescence efficiencies have already been\nreported.5 The femtosecond isotropic decay of the fluores-\ncence at different wavelengths is provided and is also used to\nestimate the energy transfer rate. The fluorescence decay pro-\nfile is given for the aldehyde dendrons, which are used as\nmodel compounds. The ultrafast fluorescence anisotropy de-\ncay for the different generations of dendrimers is provided.\nThe model compound bis-MSB, which is related to the\nA-DSB core structure is also investigated for a comparison.\nThese measurements are motivated by the quest for further\nunderstanding of the mechanisms involved in energy transfer\nprocesses in dendrimers, the role of delocalization, and the\neffect of intermolecular interactions in dendrimer structures.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe dendrimers and dendron used in this study are\nshown in Fig. 1. The core of the dendrimers consists of a\ncentral nitrogen atom, to which three distyrylbenzene ~DSB!\nunits are connected. G2 dendrons, consisting of meta-linked\nstilbene units, are attached to this core, and t-butyl surface\ngroups confer solubility in a range of organic solvents. The\ndendrimers G0, G2 materials can be readily spin-coated to\nform good quality films, and have been successfully used to\nmake organic light-emitting diodes.5 The degree of branch-\ning ~generation number! determines the size of the molecule\nand provides an innovative way of controlling the charge\nmobility in films.5 In this paper, we focus on the properties\nof the isolated molecules in solution and in particular the\nzero ~G0! and second generation dendrimers ~G2! together\nwith the second generation aldehyde dendrons ~SD2!. This\nselection of materials therefore allows the properties of the\ncore, dendron, and dendrimer to be studied in a systematic\nmanner.\nUV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a\nHewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer and\nthe fluorescence spectra were measured with a Shimadzu RF-\n1501 spectrofluorophotometer. Photoluminescence excitation\nspectra were measured using an Instruments SA Fluoromax\nfluorimeter. Time-resolved polarized fluorescence was stud-\nied by using the femtosecond up-conversion spectroscopy\ntechnique. The upconversion system used in our experiments\nis described in detail elsewhere.36\u201338 Briefly, the sample so-\nlution was excited with a frequency-doubled light from a\nmode-locked Ti-sapphire laser ~Tsunami, Spectra Physics!.\nThis produces pulses of approximately 100 fs duration in a\nwavelength range of 385\u2013430 nm. The polarization of the\nexcitation beam for the anisotropy measurements was con-\ntrolled with a Berek compensator. The sample cuvette was 1\nmm thick and is held in a rotating holder to avoid possible\nphotodegradation and other accumulative effects. The hori-\nzontally polarized fluorescence emitted from the sample was\nup-converted in a nonlinear crystal of b-barium borate using\na pump beam at about 800 nm that was first passed through\na variable delay line. This system acts as an optical gate and\nenables the fluorescence to be resolved temporally with a\ntime resolution of about 200 fs ~pump-excitation 790\/395 nm\ncross correlation function had a FWHM of 190 fs!. Spectral\nresolution was achieved by dispersing the up-converted light\nin a monochromator and detecting it by using a photomulti-\nplier tube ~Hamamatsu R1527P!. The excitation average\npower was kept at this level of below 0.5 milliwatts. In this\nexcitation intensity regime the fluorescence dynamics was\nfound to be independent of the excitation intensity for all\ninvestigated solutions.\nThis up-conversion technique is excellent in providing\ntime-dependent fluorescence data on the femtosecond and\npicosecond time scales. Measurements on the ns time scale\nwere also carried out by time-correlated single photon count-\ning following excitation using an IBH nanosecond flashlamp.\nIn both femtosecond and nanosecond measurements fluores-\nFIG. 1.

The quality of the fit was monitored by values of the\nreduced x2 as well as by inspection of the residuals and\nautocorrelation function.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Steady state absorption and emission spectra\nThe absorption spectra of the G0 and G2 dendrimers\ntogether with the SD2 dendron in chloroform are shown in\nFig. 2. The G2 dendrimer spectrum resembles a superposi-\ntion of the absorptions due to the core and to stilbene. This\nmight be expected because of the meta-arrangement of the\ndendron link ~cross conjugation!. However, the spectra are\nnot exactly a superposition: the absorption maximum of G2\nat 320 nm associated with the stilbene groups in the den-\ndrons is ;20 nm ~2083 cm21, 0.25 eV! to the red of the peak\nobserved for the stilbene in the same solvent. It has been\nsuggested4 that in spite of meta-linking stilbene, there is a\nsmall amount of p-electron delocalization in the dendrons.\nThe absorption spectrum of aldehyde dendrons of the second\ngeneration system ~SD2, shown in Fig. 2! showed the same\nabsorption maximum as that obtained for the amino core\ndendrimer G2, which is also again redshifted relative to the\nabsorption peak of the stilbene molecule. This suggests the\nassignment of the absorption band of G2 at 320 nm to the\nabsorption of dendrons in the dendrimer molecule. The red-\nshift relative to the stilbene absorption peak could be an\nindication of some degree of exciton delocalization beyond\none stilbene unit in the stilbene dendrons dendrimer shell.\nThe absorption maximum in G2 dendrimer associated with\nthe core is very slightly shifted to the red from the A-DSB\nabsorption spectrum in G0.\nThe fluorescence spectra of G0 and G2 in chloroform\nwere found to be similar and independent of excitation wave-\nlength. The result for G2 is presented in Fig. 2 and shows\nthat the emission is entirely from the core of the dendrimer.\nEven when this molecule is excited at the peak of the den-\ndron absorption, no steady state dendron emission is ob-\nserved. This suggests that energy transfer from the dendron\nto the core is very efficient. We have investigated this further\nusing photoluminescence excitation ~PLE! spectroscopy. In a\nsample in which the photoluminescence quantum yield is\nindependent of excitation wavelength, the intensity of lumi-\nnescence will be proportional to the number of photons ab-\nsorbed. The PLE spectra of G0 and G2 are shown in Fig. 3.\nA plot of ~1 \u2013 T) where T is the transmission of the sample is\nshown for comparison. (1 \u2013 T) is a measure of the absorption\nof the sample and proportional to the number of photons\nabsorbed. The fact that the absorption and PLE spectra are\ncoincident across the entire excitation spectrum indicates that\nthe efficiency of energy transfer from the dendron to the core\nis close to 100%.\nB.

A fluorescence risetime is observed at longer wave-\nlengths. Generally, these dynamics could be associated with\neither solvent rearrangement or photoinduced solute confor-\nmational changes.40,41 The aldehyde dendron ~SD2! can be\nhelpful for distinguishing between these possibilities. It was\nmeasured on the same time scale and in the same solvent as\nthe dendrimer, but as can be seen in Fig. 5 ~inset!, does not\nshow fast rise or decay features. We therefore propose con-\nformational changes42 of the excited dendrimer core to be the\norigin of the fluorescence dynamics of G0 shown in Fig. 4.\nNanosecond time-resolved luminescence measurements\nwere carried out at a range of excitation and detection wave-\nlengths for G0 and G2, and the decays were close to mo-\nnoexponential with a time constant of 1.860.2 ns. This value\nis typical of a strongly absorbing organic molecule. The life-\ntime of the dendron SD2 was measured to be 1.360.2 ns.\nThe fluorescence dynamics of SD2 on subnanosecond time\nscale is shown in Fig. 5. It can be described by a two-\nexponential decay law with time constants 116 ps and 1.3 ns.\nThe slowly decaying component is in good agreement with\nthat obtained with nanosecond time-resolved luminescence\nmeasurements. It is established that the fluorescence lifetime\nof trans-stilbene in solution is of the order of 70 ps ~depend-\ning on the solvent! and directed by a trans cis photoisomer-\nization process.43 The appearance of a long-lived component\nin the stilbene dendrons results as compared to the isolated\ntrans-stilbene may indicate the delocalization of excitation\nbeyond one stilbene unit in the stilbene dendron. Such a\npossibility was suggested above on the basis of steady state\nspectral measurements. Delocalization of the excitation\ncould contribute to a significant hindrance to photoisomer-\nization ~conformation! processes thus leading to elongation\nof the fluorescence decay time.37,42,44\nTo probe the intramolecular interaction between stilbene\ndendrons shell and A-DSB core we compared the fluores-\ncence kinetics for the dendrimer with and without stilbene\ndendrons: G0, G2. Chloroform solutions with concentrations\n;531025 M were used in this experiment. The result is\nshown in Fig. 6. The decay curves in the figure ~and also the\ninset! have been normalized in accordance with the peak\nabsorption of the dendrimer cores of G0 and G2 at 420 nm.\nIt is clearly seen from Fig. 6 that the fluorescence dynamics\nof G2 differ from those of G0 when fluorescence is excited at\n385 nm. However, under excitation at 395 nm fluorescence\ndecay curves for G2 and G0 are almost identical ~Fig. 6,\ninset!. Arrows in the absorption spectrum ~shown in Fig. 2!\nlabel both excitation wavelengths 385 and 395 nm. It is\nclearly seen in Fig. 2 that additional absorption appears in\nG2 as compared to G0 when excitation is shifted from 395\nnm to 385 nm. As the absorption peak of G2 at 320 nm is\nassociated with the absorption of stilbene dendrons an appre-\nciable part of the incident light was absorbed by stilbene\ndendrons of the G2 in case of excitation at 385 nm. The\nenergy absorbed by stilbene dendrons at 385 nm could be\ntransferred to the core. Therefore there are two channels for\nthe excitation of the G2 core at 385 nm: direct excitation and\nthe excitation via energy transfer from the dendrons. Thus\nwe can attribute the difference between fluorescence dynam-\nFIG. 4. Fluorescence decay of G0 at different emission wavelengths. Exci-\ntation wavelength was of 395 nm.\nFIG. 5.

The\nresults for lem5480 nm is shown in Fig. 7. An additional\nfast component is clearly seen for G2 as compared to that for\nG0. We also found the relative contribution of the short-lived\ncomponent of G2 relative to that for G0 to increase with the\nemission wavelength decrease from 480 to 450 nm. The fluo-\nrescence spectrum of aldehyde dendrons ~model system for\ndonor! had a maximum at about 415 nm ~shown in Fig. 2!.\nThe additional fast component in the fluorescence dynamics\nof G2 with respect to the G0 dynamics at relatively short\nemission wavelengths can be tentatively attributed to the\nfluorescence of the dendron before energy transfer to the\ncore takes place.\nC. Fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements\nTo gain a further insight into energy transfer ~energy\nmigration! processes in A-DSB dendrimer molecules we in-\nvestigated the fluorescence anisotropy dynamics in G0 and\nG2. Preliminary results on the fluorescence anisotropy in G0\nand G2 have been reported in our previous short\ncommunication.45 Experimental florescence anisotropy R(t)\nwas calculated from the decay curves for the intensities of\nfluorescence polarized parallel Ipar(t) and perpendicularly\nIper(t) to the polarization of the excitation light according to\nthe equation\nR~ t !5\nIpar2GIper\nIpar12GIper\n. ~3!\nThe factor G accounts for the difference in sensitivities for\nthe detection of emission in the perpendicular and parallel\npolarized configurations. This factor was measured using\nperylene in methanol as a reference. In the real experiment\nthe G factor has been found to be essentially unity ~1.02\n60.02!. The results of depolarization measurements in G0\nand G2 are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. The fluorescence anisot-\nropy decays to a small residual value of about 0.06 within\nthe instrument response function duration and remains un-\nchanged during the fluorescence decay time. Fluorescence\nanisotropy profiles are seen to be very similar for G0 and G2\nindicating the fast fluorescence depolarization process is pre-\ndominantly associated with the dendrimer core and not sen-\nsitive to presence of the stilbene dendrons. It is also worth\nnoting that R(t) for G0 was found to be independent of the\nexcitation wavelength in the range 385\u2013430 nm. The last\nobservation is very important with regard to the possible\nexplanation of low fluorescence anisotropy. For example, it\ncan be suggested that low value of fluorescence anisotropy is\nassociated with simultaneous excitation of two different elec-\ntronic transitions with mutually different orientations of di-\npoles followed by the emission from one of them possessing\nlower energy ~relaxed state!. In this situation it is possible to\nfind the excitation wavelength at which the emission will be\ncompletely depolarized as it takes place for simultaneous ex-\ncitation of S2 and S1 transitions in simple molecules.46 Ob-\nviously this is not the case for A-DSB as no appreciable\nexcitation wavelength dependence of the residual anisotropy\nwas observed.\nTo gain a further insight into the physics behind the fast\ndepolarization process we measured the fluorescence anisot-\nFIG. 7.

It is clearly seen that fluores-\ncence anisotropy dynamics of the model system of bis-MSB\nstrongly differs from that of dendrimer. Starting at the initial\nvalue close to 0.4 fluorescence anisotropy decays with the\ntime constant of 82 ps, which agrees with the rotational dif-\nfusion time of bis-MSB molecule. For G0 and G2 it was\ndifficult to see the contribution of overall molecular rotation\nas the fluorescence anisotropy dropped to a very small re-\nsidual value within the time interval of ;200 fs, which is\nmuch shorter than any reasonable time scale of rotational\nmovement. Comparing the anisotropy decay results for G0\nand G2 with those for the model system bis-MSB suggests\nultrafast transition dipole reorientation due to intersegment\ninteractions in these dendrimers.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Energy transfer from stilbene dendrons\nto A-DSB core\nThe PLE results suggest that the efficiency of energy\ntransfer from the dendron to the core of G2 is close to 100%.\nThis result is consistent with PLE measurements on related\ndendrimers based on DSB ~no nitrogen!, DSB anthracene,\nand porphyrin4,18 in which energy transfer was found to take\nplace with efficiency approaching unity.18 The time-resolved\nmeasurements also provide a means of estimating the effi-\nciency of energy transfer. The first step is to estimate the rate\nof energy transfer from dendron to core. To do this we fit the\ndecay curve for G0 using two exponential decay functions\nwith the pre-exponential factors A1 ,A2 and residual ~long-\nlived! fluorescence Ar :\nY o~ t !5A1 expS 2tt1 D1A2 expS 2tt2 D1u~ t !*Ar . ~4!\nHere t1, t2 are decay times and u(t) is a step function. Then\nwe fit the decay curve for G2 using three exponential decay\nfunctions with pre-exponential factors B1 ,B2 ,B3 and re-\nsidual long-lived fluorescence Br :\nY 0~ t !5B1 expS 2tt1 D1B2 expS 2tt2 D\n1B3 expS 2tt3 D1u~ t !*Br . ~5!\nIn the last fit we kept the decay times t1 ,t2 fixed and equal\nto those obtained for G0. As a result of this procedure we\nfound B3 to be negative ~corresponding to additional risetime\ncomponent! and t3 equal to 7.261.0 ps. This observed ad-\nditional risetime in the fluorescence dynamics of G2 deter-\nmines the energy transfer rate constant kET>1\/t3. It is worth\nnoting that additional fast component observed in the emis-\nsion of G2 at 480 nm, which has been assigned to emission\nof stilbene dendrons ~see Fig. 7 and related text!, possesses\nabout the same decay time constant as the risetime at 515\nnm. This indicates the decay of donor ~dendrons! to be es-\nsentially controlled by the energy transfer process to the ac-\nceptor ~A-DSB core!.\nTo estimate the relative contribution of the core fluores-\ncence excited via energy transfer from dendrons relative to\nthat of directly excited core we performed the model calcu-\nlations of the fluorescence dynamics in case of simultaneous\nexcitation of a donor and acceptor. For these model calcula-\ntions we suggested the donor excited state decay to be com-\npletely directed by the energy transfer process. We also as-\nsumed the acceptor decay under direct excitation to be two\nexponential with the second time constant to be very long\n~residual long-lived fluorescence!. This decay function con-\ntains one fast exponential instead of two used in the best fit\nof a real acceptor @Eq. ~4!#. With these simplifications it is\npossible to derive the analytical expression for the time-\ndependent fluorescence intensity using the procedure analo-\ngous to that for excimer emission.47 The relative contribution\nof directly excited acceptors was estimated using the best fit\ndata to experimental decays to be 0.81. This is in reasonable\nagreement with the rough estimation of this ratio from the\ncomparison of the fluorescence intensities ~see Fig. 6 and\nnormalization procedure described above!, which has been\nfound to be 0.73.\nIn a weak coupling limit of Eq. ~1!, when the homoge-\nneous linewidth is much larger than the interchromophore\ninteraction the energy transfer can be described as a hopping\nof excitation. This case is referred to as the Fo\u00a8rster limit.23\nTo evaluate the ability of the theory23 to describe the energy\ntransfer from dendrons to the core in G2, we compare the\ntheoretical and measured energy transfer rates. The Fo\u00a8rster\u2019s\nrate of energy transfer between donor and acceptor separated\nby a distance RDA is given by\nkt~r !5\n1\ntD\nS RFRDAD\n6\n, ~6!\nwhere tD is the fluorescence lifetime of the donor in the\nabsence of acceptor and RF is the Fo\u00a8rster radius, which is the\ncritical distance between the donor and acceptor such that the\nenergy transfer probability equals the emission probability.\nRF can be calculated using the following equation:23\nFIG. 10. Fluorescence anisotropy decay for the model system bis-MSB.\nAnisotropy dynamics of G2 is shown for comparison.\n8899J. Chem.

The over-\nlap integral J(M21 cm3) is given by\nJ5E\n0\n\u2018\nFD~l!\u0095eA~l!\u0095l4\u0095dl , ~8!\nwhere eA(l) is the molar extinction coefficient of the accep-\ntor and FD(l) is the emission spectrum of the donor normal-\nized according to *FA(l)dl51. In our calculations k2 is\ngiven a value of 2\/3, which corresponds to the averaging of\nall possible mutual orientations during energy transfer time.\nThis is a reasonable assumption as the depolarization rate of\nthe acceptor ~G0! is extremely high in our case ~see Figs. 8\nand 9!. The fluorescence quantum yield of SD2 is not accu-\nrately known but it can be roughly estimated to be 0.3 using\nbis-MSB as a reference. Bis-MSB absorption and fluores-\ncence spectra are similar to those for aldehyde dendrons and\nits quantum yield is close to unity.48 The fluorescence spec-\ntrum of aldehyde dendrons ~donor! and the spectral overlap\nwith absorption spectrum of G0 ~acceptor! is shown in Fig.\n11. From this figure it is clearly seen that the overlap of the\ndonor emission and the acceptor absorption is excellent in-\ndicating that probability of donor\u2013acceptor energy transfer\nshould be high. Indeed, the Fo\u00a8rster radius RF calculated in\naccordance with Eq. ~7! was equal to 46 \u00c5. To calculate the\ntheoretical energy transfer rate kt it is necessary to estimate\nthe interchromophore distance RDA . Assuming RDA517 \u00c5\n~the distance between center of the core nitrogen and the\nnearest double bond of a stilbene dendron! an energy transfer\nrate of kt50.331012 s21 is obtained. This transfer rate cor-\nresponds to transfer time of 3.3 ps. This is about two times\nfaster than the energy transfer time estimated from time-\nresolved measurements. However, one should take into ac-\ncount that only the homogeneous line shape should be used\nfor evaluating the overlap integral.23 Using observed absorp-\ntion and emission lines in the calculation of the overlap in-\ntegral can lead to an overestimate of the excitation transfer\nrate. Additionally, the very rough estimation of the yield of\nSD2 could also lead to a discrepancy between calculated and\nexperimental transfer rate. It is worth noting that there is no\nobvious necessity to use other than the Fo\u00a8rster mechanism to\ndescribe the energy transfer in the case of A-DSB dendrimer.\nThe energy transfer efficiency can be estimated using the\nfollowing relationship:\nFET5\nkttD\n11kttD\n. ~9!\nTaking tD to be equal to the measured value of the dendron\nlifetime of 1.3 ns, and 1\/kt equal to 7.2 ps gives a value of\nFET of 99.5%, confirming the high efficiency of energy\ntransfer deduced from steady state measurements.\nB. Interaction between DSB branches\nIt should be noted that the zero-generation unit G0 ~ac-\ntually the dendrimer core! is not a simple DSB segment. It is\na starlike molecule consisting of three DSB segments bonded\nto a central nitrogen atom. The absorption of the G0 is\nshifted to the red by 3969 cm21 ~0.49 eV! as compared to\nthat for DSB. It can be suggested that this shift is due to\neither mesomeric effect from the electron rich nitrogen core\natom and\/or due to some delocalization between the DSB\nunits allowed by nitrogen.5 The dipole\u2013dipole interaction be-\ntween DSB units is also possible. These different interactions\ncould lead to the formation of coherent excitonic states31,49,50\nor hopping-type relaxation of excitations completely local-\nized on one DSB branch ~incoherent interaction51,52!.\nIt may be suggested that the residual fluorescence anisot-\nropy of G0 is nearly zero because of an irreversible relax-\nation to a state with the transition dipole orientated at about\n55\u00b0 ~magic angle! with respect to the initially excited one.\nHowever, this simple two-state model is not reasonably ap-\nplicable to our particular symmetrical geometry. For ex-\nample, in the A-DSB system a more realistic angle of 60\u00b0\n~120\u00b0! and for the case of one irreversible step the fluores-\ncence anisotropy should be negative ~20.05!. However, our\nresults show a positive value close to what is expected for\nthe equilibrium process in a symmetrical molecule with three\nbranches.\nExciton migration via intramolecular excitation transfer\nin molecules or molecular complexes with high degree of\nsymmetry was experimentally investigated in a number of\npublications.51,53\u201356 Using fluorescence depolarization it is\npossible to observe this intramolecular excitation transfer be-\ncause the latter process is accompanied by the reorientation\nof the transition dipole resulting in depolarization of the\nemission. Fast decay of fluorescence anisotropy ~few pico-\nseconds! in an amino-substituted triphenylbenzene deriva-\ntive, ~p-EFTP!, was detected by femtosecond polarized tran-\nsient absorption.51 The fast depolarization was assigned to an\nexciton migration ~hopping, incoherent interaction! between\nthe branches of this threefold symmetry molecule.51 The ex-\ncitation dynamics in several threefold and fourfold symmetry\nbranched molecules was probed by the time-resolved fluo-\nrescence anisotropy.56 Both Fo\u00a8rster-type incoherent energy\nFIG. 11.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nmigration between branches and excitonic-type coherent\ntransport mechanism could be observed depending on mo-\nlecular architecture.56 A general description of fast depolar-\nization in a symmetrical branched molecular system is the\nrelaxation of a superposition of degenerate states with differ-\nent orientations of transition dipoles. An analysis of the fluo-\nrescence anisotropy associated with twofold and threefold\ndegenerate states with different orientation of transition di-\npoles has been discussed by Wynne and Hochstrasser.30 The\ncase of excitonic splitting for dimers,30,49 the role of nuclear\ndegrees of freedom ~vibrations!,50,55 as well as depolarization\nin higher molecular aggregates with static disorder57 were\nalso analyzed. It is a remarkable feature of symmetrical mo-\nlecular systems that they can exhibit an initial anisotropy\nlarger than 0.4, the initial anisotropy observed in a collection\nof randomly oriented single chromophores.30,49 The second\nimportant parameter is the residual anisotropy for the equili-\nbrated system. This parameter is also strongly related to the\ngeometry of the molecular system and should be 0.1 for\nsimple in-plane symmetrical dipoles arrangement30,32,49\u201355\nwhile in three-dimensional structures it can drop to zero30 ~in\nthe absence of overall molecular rotation!.\nIn G0 three distyrylbenzene chromophores are supposed\nto be grouped in a \u2018\u2018propeller\u2019\u2019-like arrangement around the\nnitrogen.58 The angle between transition dipoles of adjacent\nDSB chromophores can be estimated to be ;120\u00b0 provided\nthese dipoles are directed along the direction of the bonds to\nthe nitrogen.58 It is easy to calculate the residual fluorescence\nanisotropy after relaxation between branches just using the\nlaw of additivity of anisotropies.59 This yields a residual an-\nisotropy value 0.1 in this case. It is different than the ob-\nserved value of about 0.06 ~see Figs. 9 and 10!. The reason\nfor this difference could lay in a deviation of the directions\nof DSB transition dipoles from the directions of DSB\u2013\nnitrogen bonds in the plane of the principal axis of the mol-\necule. Such deviations lead to a different value of residual\nanisotropy60 ~an inclination angle relative to the N\u2013C plane\nof about 15.8\u00b0 could lead to the residual anisotropy of 0.06\nobserved in our experiments!. This result suggests the tran-\nsition dipole arrangement in this molecule in solution to\nslightly deviate from planar geometry.\nThe initial dynamics of fluorescence anisotropy is very\nfast, completing within the duration of the instrument re-\nsponse function ~Fig. 9!. Thus, it is difficult to analyze the\nfluorescence anisotropy decay law and deduce the initial an-\nisotropy at a good confidence level. Application of standard\ndeconvolution procedures for difference and isotropic decays\nis complicated by relatively large background noise in the\nvicinity of IRF, which is associated to some extent with the\npresence of the risetime feature in the isotropic decay.32 To\nmake a reasonable estimation of the fluorescence anisotropy\ndecay time we performed impulse reconvolution61 assuming\nsimple one-exponential decay law for anisotropy decay with\ntime constant ta and the residual value of tr . The isotropic\nfluorescence decay function was constructed using best fit\nresults described above. This analysis yielded the anisotropy\ndecay time ta of 5767 ps and the residual anisotropy tr of\n0.05560.003. An initial anisotropy r0 best fit result was of\n0.4260.05. The best fit curves obtained for parallel and per-\npendicularly polarized fluorescence components as well as\nfor raw anisotropy are shown in Fig. 9. The initial anisotropy\nfor a molecule having symmetry higher than C2 can signifi-\ncantly exceed the value 0.4 associated with photoselection of\nan isolated dipole.30,49,50 However, our detection wavelength\nwas redshifted relative to excitation. This implies that we\nwere probing predominantly relaxed states for which the ini-\ntial coherent superposition of the dipoles could be substan-\ntially destroyed. It should also be noted that our estimation of\nr0 has been made on the basis of an oversimplified model of\nmonophasic ~monoexponential! anisotropy decay and infor-\nmation about very initial anisotropy behavior could not be\nsufficiently accurate.\nFluorescence depolarization combined with isotropic\nfluorescence decay and spectroscopic information can be a\nsensitive probe for the nature of energy transfer ~exciton or\nhopping dynamics!.31,32,34 An extremely fast depolarization\nrate could indicate strong interaction between branches in the\ncore. For this reason the weak interaction limit ~Fo\u00a8rster\nlimit!, which was used for interpretation of energy transfer\nbetween dendrons and the core could not be applicable for\ninterbranch energy migration. Our estimation of the Fo\u00a8rster\ntransfer time between DSB branches gave the value of about\n4 ps. To describe qualitatively the interbranch energy migra-\ntion process we used the analytical general expression for the\nanisotropy decay rate kdep in a ring molecular system at high\ntemperature derived in31\nkdep5GS 11 1N (k51N G2G2116J2 sin2S 2pN D sin2S 2pkN D D ,\n~10!\nwhere J is the nearest neighbor interaction, G is the homo-\ngeneous linewidth, N is the number of chromophores, and\nkdep51\/tr is the inverse depolarization time. An inhomoge-\nneous broadening is neglected in the approach.31 For the sys-\ntem with three chromophores the expression ~10! becomes\nkdep5\n6G\n~G2\/J219 ! . ~11!\nThe dependence of depolarization time ta51\/kdep on in-\nterchromophore interaction determined by Eq. ~11! is shown\nin Fig. 12. For the region where the homogeneous linewidth\nis much larger than the interchromophore interaction (G\n@J), the energy transfer can be described as a hopping of\nexcitations. The opposite limit (G!J) is the exciton limit\nwhere the system can be considered as molecular aggregate\nwith its own excitonic energy levels.31\u201334 It is seen from Fig.\n12 that the dependence of the depolarization rate on the in-\nteraction behaves differently in these two regions. The ex-\nperiment on selective excitation of the G0 fluorescence\nshowed no dependence of the fluorescence spectra on the\nexcitation wavelength. This is an indication of predominantly\nhomogeneously broadened transition on the time scale of\nsteady state spectral measurements. However, time-resolved\nexperiments showed the dependence of the fluorescence dy-\nnamics on the emission wavelength in the picosecond time\nrange ~see Fig. 4!.

Additionally, we found no detect-\nable dependence of the fluorescence dynamics on the excita-\ntion wavelength. These results allow us to suggest the homo-\ngeneous linewidth of G0 to be in the range of 1900\u20132900\ncm21. The interaction J can be estimated using Eq. ~11! to be\nabout 600 cm21 ~it is also seen from Fig. 12!.

CONCLUSIONS\nWe have measured the photodynamics of a novel organic\nA-DSB dendrimer and estimated the energy transfer rate\nfrom the stilbene dendrons to the core. Steady state measure-\nments showed the energy transfer efficiency to be approxi-\nmately 99.5%, while time-resolved measurements showed\nthe rate to be approximately 7 ps. Calculations of the energy\ntransfer efficiency and rate from time resolved measurements\nagreed well with the steady state spectra, suggesting that at\nthese lower generations the Fo\u00a8rster model may be suitable in\ndescribing the mechanism of the energy transfer from den-\ndrons to the core. The anisotropy decay of the A-DSB den-\ndrimer system was very fast, decaying to a value of 0.055 in\nabout 100 fs. The fast decay can be attributed to a coherent\ninterchromophore energy transport in the core. The anisot-\nropy results of model compounds related to the A-DSB den-\ndrimer showed the reasonable result of long rotational diffu-\nsion decay and no energy transfer. This suggests that the core\nbranched geometry facilitates the very fast anisotropy decay,\nand may play a large role in the intermolecular interaction in\nthe similar dendrimer systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Re-\nsearch, The American Chemical Society\u2013Petroleum Re-\nsearch Fund for partial funding of this project.
