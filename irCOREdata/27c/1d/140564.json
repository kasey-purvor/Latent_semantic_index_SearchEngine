In this paper, electrohydrodynamic atomization combined with a polymeric\nmicromoulding technique was used to form PZT single element devices using a PZT sol-gel slurry\nwithout an etching process. The PZT single element device was initially designed to work as a\npiezoelectric ultrasonic transducer consisting of a circular or a square of various sizes, which was\nproduced and used to evaluate the process. The resulting PZT device had a homogenous\nmicrostructure. It was observed that the relative permittivity of the circular and square single element\ndevices was especially high at small size due to the fringe effect. The results show that the radius and\nwidth of the PZT single circular and square element devices with a thickness of 15\u00b5m should be\nbigger than 400\u00b5m in order to reduce the fringe effect.\nIntroduction\nPiezoelectric thick films show great potential for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)\napplication such as ultrasonic transducers working in thickness mode. Ultrasonic transducers are\nwidely used today especially in the field of medical imaging systems. The continuous demand of\nhigh-resolution images requires desirable materials, fabrication techniques and design of structures in\ngeneration of ultrasonic transducer. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is a suitable material for ultrasonic\ntransducers because of its high piezoelectric constant, relative permittivity and electromechanical\ncoupling factor [1]. High frequency in the region of 30 - 70 MHz also needs to be obtained for getting\nhigh resolution images [2]. Frequency is in inverse with of PZT film thickness. Therefore, thicknesses\nof 10-100 \u00b5m need to be achieved to meet the high frequency requirement, which represents a\nsignificant technical challenge using thin film fabrication methods such as physical vapour deposition\nand chemical vapour deposition, due to the slow deposition rates and high levels of stress generated\nduring processing which can lead to crack of the film [4]. The use of conventional bulk ceramic\nprocessing with subsequent machining and bonding is wasteful of material and time consuming [4].\nOther thick film fabrication techniques based on sintering of ceramic particles such as screen printing\nare limited by high temperature processing which can easily result in damage to the bottom electrode\nand substrate [5].\nElectrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) is a physical process where an electrified liquid is\ndispersed to fine droplets due to an electrostatic force working on the charged surface of a liquid. The\nelectrical shear stress elongates the liquid meniscus formed at the outlet of a capillary, to the form of a\ncone and\/or a jet which next deforms and disrupts into droplets as a result of the electric and\nmechanical force [6]. This makes it possible to produce fine droplets using a coarse nozzle with a\ndependence on electrohydrodynamic force rather than the nozzle size. The use of suspensions in\nEHDA has shown great potential in recent years and has been introduced to form microstructures in\nbioengineering [7] and chemical engineering [8]. Ink-jet printing (IJP) is commonly used as a\ndeposition method to form ceramic structures [9]. Compared with IJP, EHDA offers two distinct\nadvantages with the use of suspension: a) the size of deposition product is independent of nozzle\ndiameter and b)there is less risk of nozzle blockage.\nIn this work, a PZT composite sol-gel slurry was prepared, which helped to produce PZT films of a\nwide range of thickness with low sintering temperature [10]. For the purpose of this work, EHDA\ntechnique combined with polymeric micromoulding process was employed to deposit PZT single\nelements from the PZT composite sol-gel slurry.\nExperimental details\nMask design. Three 5'' Chromium\/glass photomasks were prepared. One was for bottom electrode\ndeposition, another one was for PZT deposition, and the third one was for top electrode deposition.\nTwo types of PZT thick film element features were designed on the masks. One type of features was a\nseries of circular elements with radius varying from 70\u00b5m to 1000 \u00b5m; another type of features was a\nseries of square elements with width varying from 50 \u00b5m to 1500 \u00b5m. Within these circular and\nsquare elements there were two types of top electrodes: one type had extension pad, and the other\ntype had no extension pad. Using these test features, properties of the PZT thick film single element\ndevices in terms of electrode feature and size were examined.\nPolymeric micromould formation. The fabrication route of PZT single element is shown in Figure 1,\nwhich is photolithography coupled with an EHDA deposition technique. Prior to any deposition the\nSi wafer was cleaned using acetone\/propan-1-ol on a spinner and then dried at 100\u2103 for 3 minutes.\nThe top and bottom electrode were deposited with a layer of Ti\/Pt (8\/100 nm) using RF magnetron\nPZT powder 10 g\nPZT sol 14.2 ml\nSintering aid Cu2O\/PbO 0.069\/0.428 g\nDispersant KR55 0.2 g\nZirconia ball-milling media 100 g\n(2)Pattern of photoreisist\nunver UV light\n(4) Remove photoresist and\nsinter PZT structure\n(3) EHDA deposition of\nPZT structure\n(1) Spin coating of\nAZ9260 Photoresist\nFig. 1, Flow chart illustrating the PZT thick\nfilm element fabrication route using EHDA\ndeposition\nTable 1, Composition of the PZT slurry\nusing in the EHDA deposition process\nsputtering (Nordiko Ltd., Hampshire, UK). The deposition features were prepared by spin coating a\nlayer of AZ1818 photoresist and dried at 115\u2103 for 90 s, then exposed under UV light for 10 s and\nrevealed in the developer (MF-319) for 40 s. Three layers of AZ9260 positive photoresist\n(MicroChemicals GmbH, Ulm, German) were spun onto a 4'' silicon wafer to achieve a polymer film\napproximately 38 \u00b5m thick as polymeric micromould for the EHDA deposition of PZT structure. The\npreparing procedures are as follows: the first layer of photoresist was spun down at 2400 rpm for 60 s,\nand then baked on a hot plate at 100 \u00baC for 160 s; the second and third layers were spun down at 2100\nrpm for 60 s, and then baked at 110 \u00baC for 160 s. The spin coated photoresist was then exposed to UV\nlight on a MA56 mask aligner (SUSS MicroTec. Lithography GmbH, Garching, Germany) at a beam\nintensity of 6.2 mWcm-2 for 403 s. The polymer micromould structures were developed in the\nsolution of diluted AZ400K (1:4 in water) for approximately 8 minutes to obtain the micromould\nfeatures. After being cleaned with distilled water the micromoulds were dried at 100 \u00baC for 120 s\nbefore the EHDA deposition of PZT films.\nEHDA deposition of PZT. The PZT composite sol-gel slurry was prepared from PZT powder (PZ 26,\nFerroperm, Denmark) with a mean particle size of ~0.6 \u00b5m, PZT sol, dispersant KR 55 (Ken-React\nLica 38, KenRich) and Cu2O\/PbO sintering aid. The composition of the PZT slurry is shown in Table\n1. The dispersant was added to stabilize the slurry. The sintering aid helps to increase the density and\npiezoelectric properties of the sintered PZT film. All these components were mixed in a nitrogen\nenvironment and then ball-milled on a roller for 24 h. The PZT sol was prepared from the precursors\nlead acetate, titanium isopropoxide and zirconium propoxide. 3.55 g of titanium (IV) isopropoxide\n(99.99 wt.% purity) was added to 5.39 g of zirconium (IV) propoxide (76 wt.% in 1-propanol) prior to\nthe addition of the solvents 1-propanol (99.7 wt.% purity, 5 ml) and glacial acetic acid (99.8 wt.%\npurity, 10 ml). An excess (9.95 g) of lead (II) acetate trihydrate was then added to the solution and the\nsystem was refluxed at a low heat for 30 minutes. The sol concentration was adjusted to 0.42 M by\nadding 13.2 ml of 1-propanol and 12 ml of acetic acid. The chemical stoichiometric ratio of the metal\nions in the PZT sol was Pb 1.10: Zr 0.48: Ti 0.52.\nThe EHDA deposition device is shown in Figure 2, which consists of an electrohydrodynamic\nneedle, a high voltage power supply, a syringe pump and a computer controlled X-Y movement\nPower\nA\nSyringe pump\nSubstrate\nPlate ground\nelectrode\nNeedle held\nin resin\nAtomization jet\nand spray\nSilicone rubber\ntube\nX-Y Movement\nstage b\nBottom electrode\na\nMould for PZT\ndepositoin\nFig. 3, Optical micrographs showing the\nphotoresist patterned PZT thick film element\nmicromould for EHDA depsotion of PZT structure\nFig. 2, Schematic representation of EHDA deposition\nequipment set-up\nstage. The needle has an inner\/outer diameter of 0.85\/1.3 mm which was connect to a high voltage\npower supply and a syringe pump. The high voltage power supply (Glassman High Voltage Inc., NJ,\nUSA) was used to apply an electric field between the needle and the ground electrode, and a syringe\npump (KD Scientific Inc., MA, USA) was employed to provide the hydrodynamic force to push the\nPZT slurry up to the outlet of the needle. A thin aluminium plate, serving as the ground electrode, was\nplaced directly on the X-Y movement stage and connected to earth potential.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nLength (\u00b5m)\nH\nei\ngh\nt(\n\u00b5m\n)\nDuring the EHDA deposition the patterned photoresist micromould wafer was placed directly on the\naluminium plate ground electrode 1 mm below the needle exit. The PZT film was built up by\nalternately depositing in the X and Y directions on the micromould wafer for 60 layers. After every\ntwo intermediate layer depositions (one X direction scan and one Y direction scan) the PZT film was\ndried at 100 \u00baC for 5 minutes to remove solvent.\nAfter EHDA deposition the structure was sintered at 720 \u00baC for 20 minutes in a muffle furnace in\norder to pyrolyze the PZT film and remove the polymeric mould. The final PZT film structure was\ndipped in acetone for 5 minutes and then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath to remove residual photoresist.\na b\nBottom electrode\nextension pad\nTop\nelectrode\nPZT film\nTop electrode\nextension pad\nFig. 4, Surface profile of PZT film element\nFig. 6, Scanning electron microscope micrographs showing the patterned PZT thick film single element\nafter 60 EHDA deposition layers: a) circular PZT transducer and b) square PZT transducer\nFig. 5, Scanning electron microscope micrograph\nshowing the surface microstructure of the patterned\nPZT thick film element after 60 EHDA deposition\nlayers\nResults and discussion\nFig. 3 shows two typical patterned photoresist element moulds (circle and square) for EHDA\ndeposition of PZT film structure, which was ~38 \u00b5m thick measured by a Surface Profiler (Veeco\nInstruments Incorporation, UK) and presented uniform dimensional profile. Applied voltage and flow\nrate are major factors that affect the characteristics of atomization mode and deposition result. In\norder to obtain a stable jet, the flow rate and the applied voltage were kept constant at 2.2\u00d710-10 m3s-1\nand 5.5 kV during deposition. During the deposition a scan speed of 39 mm s-1 and a distance of 4 mm\nbetween two neighbouring parallel paths of deposition were set to ensure a degree of overlap between\ndeposited PZT films. After 60 layers EHDA deposition a ~15 \u00b5m thick PZT film structure was\nobtained (Fig. 4).\nThe patterned PZT element after sintering is shown in Fig. 5. It was observed that the edge of the PZT\nstructure exhibited deformation, which was caused by the deformation and degradation of the\nphotoresist during the solvent removal processes. Heat treatment was needed to remove the solvent in\nthe deposited material to obtain crack-free PZT film structure. Although the 100 \u00baC used was lower\nthan the AZ9260 photoresist maximum working temperature 110 \u00baC, several heat treatment processes\ncould also cause evaporation of the residual solvent and water and degradation of the photoactive\ncompound [11], which further induced the deformation of the deposited PZT structure.

It was observed that the relative permittivity is much higher with small\nelectrodes (radius or width < 400 \u00b5m) than that with bigger electrodes due to the fringe effect [12].\nThe inter-electrode electric field is not uniform, especially near the electrode edges, where the electric\nfield extends into the space beyond the electrodes, which induces extra relative permittivity. The\nsmaller the electrode size and the bigger the fringe effect. The relative permittivity of these element\ndevices became more consistent and reasonable with electrode radius or width larger than 400\u00b5m. It\nis suggested that electrode radius and width of the PZT thick film element bigger than 400 \u00b5m should\nbe fabricated in order to minimise the fringe effect. It was also observed that the relative permittivity\nobtained from devices with extension pads was higher than that obtained from devices without\nextension pads, which was caused by the extension induced extra electric fringing field and\ncapacitance. Attempts were also made to measure the resonant frequency and acoustic response, but\nwere not successful as planned, which was mainly due to the fact that Si back substrate restrained the\nthickness mode vibration of the PZT film. Further Si back substrate etching process is suggested to\nsolve this problem.\nSummary\nThis paper demonstrated the use of the EHDA technique combined with polymeric micromoulding\nfor depositing a PZT composite sol-gel slurry to form PZT thick film single element without harsh\netching. Circular and square PZT element structures of different sizes were produced. The elements\nwith top electrode extension pad showed higher relative permittivity compared with those without\nelectrode extension. Elements with smaller electrodes (radius or width <400 \u00b5m) had significantly\nhigher relative permittivity than those with bigger electrodes. It is suggested that the radius\/width of\nthe single circular\/square electrode should bigger than 400 \u00b5m for 15\u00b5m thick elements to reduce the\nfringe effect and to obtain reasonable relative permittivity. The piezoelectric constant (d33, f) of the PZT\nelement can be consulted from our previous work [13]. Other properties such as resonant frequency\nand acoustic response of these PZT elements are suggested to be examined after etching Si back\nsubstrate. In this work, the use of EHDA deposition and micromoulding technique provides a new,\neffective and promising manufacturing route for forming piezoelectric microstructures and MEMS\ndevices.\nReferences\n[1] G.
