INTRODUCTION\nThe structure of atomic nuclei is known to be largely\ndominated by the single-particle shell effects. For instance,\nbasic nuclear properties such as binding energies and shapes\ndepend strongly on the underlying shell structure. The study\nof nuclei beyond the valley of stability helps one to under-\nstand the way single-particle energies evolve when one goes\naway from stable nuclei to the neutron and proton drip lines.\nSuch evolutionary studies facilitate more precise predictions\nof the limit of existence of nuclear species. In the case of\nlight nuclei, the rapid change in the location of the neutron\ndrip line between the O and F isotopes is still not understood.\nThe neutron drip line seems to be reached at N=16 in O\nisotopes whereas in the neighboring F isotopes, it has been\nfound to extend up to N=22 [1,2]. Obviously, the under-\nstanding of how shell structure evolves when going from\noxygen to fluorine nuclei would shed light on how the\nnuclear force can facilitate the binding of six neutrons by the\naddition of a single proton as in 31F.\nExcited states in the neutron-rich O isotopes were previ-\nously reported by Catford et al. [3] using transfer reactions.\nThe first excited 2+ state of the N=14 nucleus 22O is\n3190 keV [4,5]. This is almost two times higher than in the\nadjacent N=10 and 12 nuclei and therefore indicates the\npresence of a N=14 (sub)shell closure. This finding is also\nsupported by the BsE2d value deduced from the inelastic\nscattering experiments of Ref. [5]. While the systematics of\nthe first excited 2+ in neon isotopes show the disappearance\nof the N=20 shell closure, a new shell effect at N=16 seems\nto appear [4]. This new N=16 gap in the sd-shell nuclei is\nalso substantiated by neutron separation energies deduced\nfrom mass measurements [6,7].\nExperimental studies using interaction cross-section mea-\nsurements [8] and longitudinal momentum sPid distributions\nafter one-and two-neutron removal [10] are consistent on a\nhalo structure in 23O, although it was shown in Ref. [9] that\nthe one- and two-neutron removal data could be understood\nin the sd-shell model without the need for a halo. In Ref. [8]\na lowering of the s orbital was suggested as giving rise to the\nN=16 magic number in the heaviest oxygen isotopes.\nIn this paper we shall report on experiments probing the\nstructure of N=12\u201316 oxygen isotopes by way of fragmen-\ntation reactions and g-ray spectroscopy. The experimental\ntechnique is described in Sec. II and the results and their\ninterpretation follow in Sec. III.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 034312 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(3)\/034312(10)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 034312-1\nII. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES\nIn order to obtain information on the structure of neutron-\nrich nuclei in the proton sd-shell region, in-beam g-ray spec-\ntroscopy using projectile fragmentation reactions has been\nperformed. Two experiments using the fragmentation of a\nstable 36S beam have been done at GANIL. Both experi-\nments are based on coincidence measurements between the\nprojectilelike fragments and their prompt g decay. A com-\nmon g-detector array has been used in both experiments. It\nconsists of 74 BaF2 detectors placed at a mean distance of\n30 cm from the target and covering nearly 4p. The relatively\nhigh velocity of the produced projectile fragments sv \/c\n.0.35d necessitates a proper Doppler correction of the de-\ntected g-rays energies. The total photo-peak efficiency of the\nBaF2 array was found to be 30% at 1.3 MeV with an average\nfull width at half maximum of 12% after Doppler correction.\nThe energy threshold of the BaF2 detectors has been adjusted\nto a minimum value in order to allow the detection of low-\nenergy g rays down to 100 keV. The produced fragments\nwere selected and identified in the SPEG spectrometer by the\nuse of time of flight, energy loss, and focal-plane position\ninformation.\nIn the first experiment a 77.5 MeV A 36S beam with an\nintensity of about 1 pnA was fragmented on a thin Be foil\ns2.77 mg\/cm2d located at the target place of SPEG, the en-\nergy loss spectrometer at GANIL. The SPEG was tuned to\nthe A \/Z=2.75 mass to charge ratio, that is between 21O and\n22O. As a result, the nuclei 20,21,22,23O were transmitted. Dur-\ning the experiment we observed 7500 23O, 4263103 22O,\n1.73106 21O, and 2303103 20O nuclei. In addition to the\nBaF2 array, four 70% high resolution Ge detectors were used\nat the most backward angles. The overall Ge detector effi-\nciency was 0.12% at 1.3 MeV. In spite of having a low ef-\nficiency, the high resolution of the Ge detectors (,30 keV at\n1.3 MeV after Doppler correction) helped to disentangle\ncomplex spectra just as those obtained for 21O. The BaF2\narray coincidence efficiency exceeded the Ge efficiency by\n1-2 orders of magnitude, especially at high energies. By gat-\ning on high-energy transitions (in the BaF2) sitting on low\nbackground one could identify transitions not seen in the Ge\nspectra. A few transitions in 22O could be observed only in\nthis way. Henceforth we shall refer to this measurement as a\n\u201csingle step fragmentation\u201d (SSF) experiment.\nIn the second experiment, we used a primary beam of 36S\ndelivered by the two GANIL cyclotrons at an energy of\n77.5 MeV A and an intensity of 400 pnA on a carbon target\nof 348 mg\/cm2 thickness placed in the SISSI spectrometer.\nThe produced nuclei were selected through the ALPHA spec-\ntrometer using a 130 mg\/cm2 Al wedge. The magnetic rigid-\nity of the ALPHA spectrometer and the optics of the beam\nline were optimized for the transmission of a cocktail beam\nmainly composed of 24F, 25,26Ne, 27,28Na, and 29,30Mg frag-\nments with energies varying from 54 MeV A to 65 MeV A\n[see Fig. 1(a)]. An \u201cactive\u201d target composed of a plastic scin-\ntillator s103 mg\/cm2d sandwiched by two carbon foils of\n51 mg\/cm2 thickness was used at the same place as the Be\ntarget in the SSF experiment. The plastic scintillator portion\nof this active target was used on an event by event basis to\nidentify the incoming nuclei via their energy loss and time of\nflight [see Fig. 1(a)]. The fragments produced by reactions of\nthe secondary beam in the active target are selected and iden-\ntified at the SPEG focal plane which was optimized for 24O\nacceptance sA \/Z=3d. As shown in Fig. 1(b), neutron-rich\nnuclei with Z ranging from 4 to 10 were also measured. This\nmethod, which has also been applied at RIKEN [11], is\ncalled \u201cdouble step fragmentation\u201d (DSF) method because it\nuses two consecutive fragmentation reactions for the produc-\ntion of the nuclei of interest.\nNoteworthy is the fact that in the case of SSF the 36S\nbeam intensity was limited to 63109 pps in order to keep\nthe singles rate in the individual g-ray detectors \u01422\n3104 s\u22121. This is a critical limitation for this method, as the\nproduction cross sections of interest are of the order of\n,1 mb, or ,10\u22126 of the total cross section. As a conse-\nquence, the g-ray spectroscopy of 24O was beyond reach in\nthe first experiment.\nIn the case of DSF a secondary cocktail beam comprised\nof nuclear species similar to the nuclei of interest was used\nwith an intensity of only 83104 s\u22121. Given such a low sec-\nondary beam intensity, only g-ray spectroscopy of those ex-\notic nuclei produced with relatively high s,0.1 mbd cross\nsections was possible. Nevertheless, 24O was produced with\nalmost a factor 10 higher intensity than it could have been\nproduced with the SSF technique. Another issue that must be\ntaken into account is the g-ray peak\/background ratio. In the\ncase of the SSF method, some of the nuclei of interest are\npopulated through a reaction where more than one nucleus is\nexcited. This is an additional source of background as g rays\nfrom all these nuclei are emitted in coincidence and only\nthose emitted from the fragments that are having the proper\nvelocity, show up as discrete lines in the Doppler corrected\nFIG. 1.

In the case of the DSF method, the nuclei of\ninterest are produced via reactions involving the removal of\nonly a few nucleons, which reduces the sources of back-\nground to the g rays emitted from the quasiprojectile nuclei.\nAnother equally important contribution to the background\ncomes from neutron emission. DSF is less susceptible to this\ntype of background in the measured g-ray spectra, as in this\ncase the process is cooler and so, a smaller number of neu-\ntrons are produced as compared to SSF. Moreover, the raw\ncounting rates of individual g-ray detectors were reduced by\ntwo orders of magnitude compared to the SSF experiment.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nMost of the results that will be presented in this section\nare interpreted in the light of shell-model calculations. These\ncalculations are based upon the full sd shell for A=16 nucle-\nons outside of a closed core of 16O. We use the Universal\nsd-shell (USD) hamiltonian [12,13] which consists of three\nsingle-particle energies for d5\/2, s1\/2, and d3\/2 and 63 two-\nbody matrix elements (TBME)\u2014only the 30 matrix elements\nwith T=1 are needed for neutron configurations of the oxy-\ngen isotopes. The USD single-particle energies are close to\nthose observed in 17O. The USD interaction is a set of TBME\nwhich were obtained from a least-squares fit of 47 linear\ncombinations of TBME to 447 binding energy data in the\nmass region A=16\u201340 as they were known up to 1983. The\nstarting set of TBME was based on the Kuo-Brown renor-\nmalized G matrix [14], and the 16 remaining linear combi-\nnations of TBME were kept at their G matrix values. The\nUSD energy levels for all of the sd-shell nuclei are given in\nRef. [16]. (The levels in this database labeled by an asterisk\nare those used for the least-squares fit.) Of particular impor-\ntance for this work are the constraints placed on the T=1\nmatrix elements by the oxygen data as they were known up\nto about the year 1983\u2014the three single-particle states in\n17O, the ground state binding energies of 18\u201321O, the excita-\ntion energy of the 2+, 4+, and 3+ states in 18O, seven excited\nstates in 19O, and three excited states in 20O (these are the\nstates labeled by asterisk in Ref. [16]). The results we discuss\nfor 21\u201324O are predictions of this USD interaction.\nIn order to understand the results it is useful to define the\neffective single-particle energies (ESPE) for the three neu-\ntron orbits. These are the bare single-particle energies (those\nin 17O) plus the addition of the monopole part of the diago-\nnal TBME with the assumption of closed-shell configura-\ntions for 22O and 24O. The monopole interaction contribution\nis the s2J+1d weighted average of the diagonal TBME mul-\ntiplied by the nsn\u22121d \/2 for the self-interaction in a single\norbit or n1n2 for the interaction between two orbits (n is the\norbit occupancy). The ESPE for the oxygen isotopes with the\nUSD interaction is shown in Fig. 16 of Ref. [17]. The\nd5\/2\u2013s1\/2 gap starts out at 0.8 MeV for 16O and increases to\n4.3 MeV in 22O sN=14d. This gap is large enough to make\n22O a magic nucleus (e.g., the shell gap is much larger than\nthe pairing gap). In addition at N=16 there is a 4.5 MeV gap\nbetween the s1\/2 and d3\/2 orbits which also makes 24O a\nmagic nucleus. In terms of the present data on energy levels,\nthe signature of a magic nucleus is an energy of the first 2+\nstate, which is significantly higher than the neighboring\neven-even nuclei.\nIf one assumes a closed-shell s0p\u22120hd model for 22O, the\ns1\/2 s1pd ESPE is given by the energy difference between\nthe 23O and 22O ground states energies [e\u02dcss1\/2d\n=\u22122.74s12d MeV from experiment], and the d5\/2 s1hd ESPE\nis given by the 22O\u2013 21O energy difference [e\u02dcsd5\/2d\n=\u22126.85s6d MeV from experiment]. Thus from the experi-\nmental ground state binding energies one would estimate\ne\u02dcss1\/2d\u2212 e\u02dcsd5\/2d=4.11s13d MeV for the gap. The USD values\nobtained with a closed-shell configuration are e\u02dcss1\/2d\n=\u22122.47 MeV, e\u02dcsd5\/2d=\u22126.79 MeV, and e\u02dcss1\/2d\u2212 e\u02dcsd5\/2d\n=4.32 MeV (the value given above). In the full sd-shell\ncalculation with USD one gets e\u02dcss1\/2d=\u22122.45 MeV,\ne\u02dcsd5\/2d=\u22127.15 MeV and e\u02dcss1\/2d\u2212 e\u02dcsd5\/2d=4.70 MeV.\nThe large d5\/2\u2212s1\/2 gap at N=14 is an essential new fea-\nture of the USD interaction, which is different from what one\ngets with the G matrix. The ab initio calculations based upon\nthe renormalized G matrix have an ESPE d5\/2\u2212s1\/2 gap at\nN=14 which is only 0.9 MeV, and 22O is not a magic\nnucleus. With the G-matrix hamiltonian the ground state of\n22O is 29% 0p\u22120h, 61% 2p\u22122h, 3% 3p\u22123h, and 7% 4p\n\u22124h, and the 2+ energy is 1.71 MeV. Energies of excited\nstates in 18\u201320O which have a large component with one neu-\ntron in the s1\/2 orbit were important in the determination of\nthe USD matrix elements which are essential for the theoret-\nical extrapolations to 21\u201323O [20]. The two diagonal matrix\nelements ksd5\/2 ,s1\/2d ;J ,T=1uVusd5\/2 ,s1\/2d ;J ,T=1l with J=2\nand 3 are the most important. This is an example of how the\nnuclear shell model with effective two-body matrix elements\ncan be used to relate data on excited states in nuclei near\nstability to the properties of more exotic nuclei\u2014in this case\nout to the neutron drip line.\nA. The oxygen isotope A=20\nAs mentioned earlier the energies of the excited states in\nthis isotope have been used as input to the shell-model cal-\nculations. The data on this isotope have been obtained only\nfrom the SSF experiment. g rays from high-lying excited\nstates of 20O are observed. The g-ray spectrum measured in\nthe Ge detectors is shown in Fig. 2. All the observed transi-\ntions fit well into the level scheme from earlier multinucleon\ntransfer reactions [15] as it can be seen in Fig. 3. Their place-\nment is supported also by the coincidence relationship ob-\nserved in our data using the BaF2 detectors. Some of the\npreviously known states are missing in our case, probably\ndue to a different feeding pattern of the excited states.\nRelative to a 0p\u22120h configuration for 22O, the lowest\nstates in 20O are those expected from the 0p\u22122h configura-\ntion with the two holes in d5\/2 coupled to J=0, 2, and 4. The\nhigher states in 20O are dominated by 1p\u22123h with the one\nparticle in s1\/2 and the three holes in d5\/2 coupled to J=3\/2,\n5 \/2, and 7\/2.\nB.

This\nnucleus has been studied earlier by transfer reactions [3] and\nthe existence of four excited states has been revealed. The\nspin and parity of the ground state has been recently sug-\ngested by Sauvan et al. [19] to be 5\/2+.\nBased on g-ray coincidences from the BaF2 detectors, we\nhave built a level scheme of 21O. The level scheme is com-\npared in Fig. 5 to the previous work of Catford et al. [3] and\nto shell-model calculations [16].\nAs can be seen in Fig. 5, a very good agreement is found\nbetween the proposed level scheme and the one calculated\nwithin the USD shell model [17]. It is also remarkable that\nthe level scheme reported by Catford et al. [3] from inclusive\nmultinucleon transfer reactions performed more than ten\nyears ago is in agreement with our level scheme extracted\nfrom g -g coincidence technique. As an example, Fig. 6\nshows the coincidence relationship between g-ray transitions\nused in the level scheme. It is interesting to note that the\nhighest energy state observed in the fragmentation reactions\nis about 1 MeV higher than the neutron separation energy\nsSn=3.807 MeVd. To prove the existence of this state, we\nshow the coincidence relation observed between the 1.854\nand 3.07 MeV transition in Fig. 6.\nRelative to the dominant closed d5\/2 shell for 22O ground\nstate which will be called 0p\u20130h, the structure of 21O can be\ninterpreted in terms of the 0p-1h 5\/2+ ground state and the\n1p-2h excited states based upon coupling of the s1\/2 (par-\nticle) orbit to the sd5\/2d\u22122 2h states (0+, 2+ and 4+) to give the\n21O excited states 1 \/2+, (3\/2+, 5 \/22+) and (7\/2+, 9 \/2+), re-\nspectively. This accounts for all of the shell-model levels (in\nthe full-space calculation) up to 4.7 MeV and all of the lev-\nels observed in this experiment. The excitation energies of\nthese states are determined by the d5\/2-s1\/2 single-particle\ngap, the 2h interaction energy and the 1p-2h interaction en-\nergy (e.g., the part related to the 1p-1h splitting in 22O). The\nspacing of the 2h states is related to the low-lying state of\n20O, 0+ (g.s.), 2+ s1.64 MeVd and 4+ s3.57 MeVd.\nIn the full sd-shell USD model, the centroid energy of the\n(7\/2+, 9 \/2+) doublet relative to the 5\/2+ ground state of\n4.0 MeV is close to the d5\/2-s1\/2 ESPE gap of 4.3 MeV. Thus\nthe experimental spacing of 4.1 MeV for (7\/2+, 9 \/2+)-5 \/2+\nis a good measure of the the d5\/2-s1\/2 ESPE energy gap. The\nspacing 1\/2+-5 \/2+ is only 1.22 MeV (2.7 MeV lower than\nthe ESPE) due to the pairing interaction in the 2h 0+ con-\nfiguration.\nThe predicted g-decay properties of 20\u201322O are given in\nRef.

[3] as a narrow resonance in their transfer\nreaction, is interesting. It is unbound by 1.1 MeV to an ,\n=4 neutron emission to the 20O ground state. Nevertheless it\nis observed to g decay. In the sd shell this ,=4 transition is\nforbidden, and the g decay puts a limit on the spectroscopic\nfactor which may arise from mixing from the sdg major\nshell. In the USD calculation the g decay is dominated\ns75% d by a moderately strong M1 between the two members\nof the (7\/2+, 9 \/2+) doublet (the weaker 25% decay to the\n5\/2+ ground state would not have been observed in this ex-\nperiment). The calculated lifetime is 57 fs. The single-\nparticle width for an ,=4 decay obtained from a typical\nWoods-Saxon potential is 0.31 keV or a lifetime of\n0.0020 fs. Thus the spectroscopic factor for the ,=4 decay\nof the 9\/2+ state must be less than 0.029. We have used a\nmuch larger 2\"v model space with the WBP interaction [18]\nto include the sdg major shell in the 9\/2+ wave function (the\nJ-scheme matrix dimension is about 33 000). The g9\/2 occu-\npancy comes out to only 0.0002 in this calculation.\nC. The oxygen isotope A=22\nFrom the SSF measurement, we have already reported\ntwo g rays of 3190(15) and 1380s10dkeV [4] corresponding\nto g decay of excited states in 22O. The first one was identi-\nfied to be the 2+\u21920+ transition, whereas the second one was\nfound to correspond to the decay from a higher excited state\nto the 2+ state. However, no spin or parity assignment was\nmade for this state. Recently, Thirolf et al. [5] have con-\nfirmed the energy and measured the electromagnetic matrix\nelement BsE2d for the 2+ state in 22O via inelastic scattering.\nIn the DSF measurement we produced the 22O nucleus by\nfragmentation of 23F, 25Ne, 26Ne, 27Na, and 28Na. The inten-\nsity of the direct feeding of the first 2+ level in 22O has been\nextracted from the data corresponding to the fragmentation\nof different species present in the secondary beam. In the\ncase of the one proton knock-out reactions, the intensity of\nthe feeding of the 2+ state in 22O was found to be 19%, in\ngood agreement with the intensity feeding s15% d given by\nthe spectroscopic factors calculated within the USD shell\nmodel. For other reactions in which more than 2 nucleons\nwere removed from the projectile the feeding intensity re-\nmained nearly constant with an average value of 35%.\nThe BaF2 spectrum of 22O, following the SSF measure-\nment is shown in Fig. 7(a). The same spectrum obtained in\nthe DSF experiment is shown in Fig. 7(b). One can see the\nimprovement of the peak to background ratio obtained by the\nDSF method as discussed in the preceding section.\nThe high resolution spectrum accumulated during the SSF\nexperiment from the Ge detectors is shown in Fig. 8. In\naddition to the two peaks observed in the BaF2 spectra, one\ncan see in this figure a previously unobserved weak g line at\n2354s6d keV. This line is more visible in the Ge spectrum\nwhere the condition that at least one BaF2 detector signal\nwas recorded in coincidence. This spectrum is displayed as\nan inset of Fig. 8. This is an indication that the 2354 keV\ntransition is a member of a relatively long cascade in 22O.\nThis is supported by the fact that the 2354 keV transition is\nfound to be in coincidence with the 2+ to 0+ 3.2 MeV tran-\nsition (see Fig. 9). In addition, this figure shows two other\nweak g lines. The energy of one is 3710(90), which is, within\nthe uncertainties, equal to the sum of the 1384s4d keV and\nthe newly observed 2354s6d keV transitions. These observa-\ntions, together with the weaker intensity of the 2354 keV\ntransition compared to that of the 1383 keV transition,\nstrongly suggest the placement of the 2354 keV transition on\nthe top of a g-ray cascade as shown in the level scheme\nproposed in Fig. 10.

Rela-\ntive to the dominant 0p-0h ground state the excited states in\n22O are 1p-1h with one particle in the s1\/2 or d3\/2 orbits\ncoupled to one hole in the d5\/2 orbit. The lowest of these are\nthe 2+ and 3+ states which are dominated by the s1\/2 orbit.\nThe energies of these states are split by the residual 1p-1h\ninteraction. Relative to the ESPE gap of 4.3 MeV the 2+ state\nis pushed down to 3.4 MeV and the 3+ state is pushed up to\n4.8 MeV. The s2J+1d weighted average of 4.2 MeV is close\nto the ESPE gap. The next states with J=0, 2, and 4 are those\ndominated by 2p\u20132h with two particles in the s1\/2 and two\nholes in the d5\/2.

The obtained g-ray\nspectra from the BaF2 detector array (DSF experiment) are\npresented in Fig. 11. Both the Doppler corrected and raw\nspectra exhibit relatively low statistics despite the large num-\nber of 23O nuclei produced. Furthermore no clear peak is\nobserved in the Doppler corrected spectrum. g rays from\ntargetlike fragments such as 7Li s477 keVd, 10C s3353 keVd,\n11C s2000 keV,4318 keVd, 12C s4439 keVd, 10B s718 keV,\n1021 keVd, 11B s2124 keV,4444 keVd, and 10Be s3368\nkeVd are seen in the raw g-ray spectrum [see Fig. 11(a)].\nThese are indications that there are no 23O transitions with\nenergies higher than 100 keV (the BaF2 detector threshold).\nIn order to better demonstrate that the 23O nucleus does\nnot have any bound excited state, we have performed a\nMonte Carlo simulation of the BaF2 array spectrum obtained\nfrom a 2.7 MeV g ray emitted by a source moving with the\nvelocity of the 23O fragments. Since the one neutron separa-\ntion energy in 23O is 2.7 MeV, no g ray is expected above\nthis value. The lowest value of the feeding intensity of the\nfirst excited state in odd mass nuclei produced in the DSF\nexperiment was found to be of the order of 30%. For this\nsimulation a conservative value of 20% was taken for 23O,\nwhich was experimentally populated mainly through frag-\nmentation reactions, where many particle removal is in-\nvolved. For comparison, the simulated spectrum with Dop-\npler correction is shown in Fig. 11(b) together with that\nobtained from our experiment. This comparison shows con-\nvincingly that if a bound excited state existed in 23O, one\nshould clearly observe a g peak in the measured spectrum.\nThis remains the case even if the direct feeding intensity of\nthis state is as low as 1%.

In this case a\n400 keV transition in 23O would have a 8.8 ns half life,\nwhich means that most of the associated g rays would be\nemitted beyond acceptance of the BaF2 array. Hence we can\npropose a lower limit of about 500 keV for the energy below\nwhich the existence of a bound excited state is possible in\n23O. According to shell-model calculations, such a low en-\nergy for the first excited state in 23O is very unlikely.\nRelative to the 0p-0h model for 22O, the 23O levels are of\n1p-0h and 2p-1h character. Of these only the lowest 1p-0h\ns1\/2 s1\/2+d is predicted to be bound and this agrees with the\npresent experiment. The first excited 5\/2+ state at 2.72 MeV\nis the lowest state and is dominated by 2p-1h configuration.\nThis is predicted to be very near the one-neutron decay\nthreshold, and this experiment indicates that it lies above the\nneutron decay threshold.\nThe predicted 3\/2+, 1p-0h state which is dominated by\nd3\/2 contributions lies at 3.28 MeV and is therefore also un-\nbound to neutron decay. Such high energy for the d3\/2 orbit\nwill mean that all of the isotopes beyond 24O, where one or\nmore nucleons resides on the d3\/2 orbit are unbound. The d3\/2\nmust be sufficiently unbound so that the pairing energy is not\nenough to bind 26O (which has not been observed). Accord-\ning to the USD interaction in the full sd shell 25O is unbound\nto one-neutron decay by 0.77 MeV and 26O is bound to one-\nneutron decay by 1.77 MeV and bound to two-neutron decay\nby 1.00 MeV. 26O would be unbound to two-neutron decay\nif the d3\/2 ESPE for 24O would be at least 0.5 MeV higher or\nthe pairing energy in the d3\/2 would be reduced by at least\n1.0 MeV (or a combination of these).\nE. The oxygen isotope A=24\nVery little is known about this presumably heaviest bound\noxygen isotope. Its lifetime and Sn value s3.7 MeVd are\nknown with large uncertainties only. In the present experi-\nment a relatively high yield of 24O (almost 7000 nuclei) has\nbeen produced mainly by a 2p removal s72% d from 26Ne\nwith the remainder produced via reactions in which more\nthan 2 nucleons were removed from the projectile. The ob-\ntained g-ray spectra in coincidence with the 24O fragments\ndetected at the SPEG focal plane are presented in Fig. 12.\nBoth the raw spectrum (non-Doppler corrected) and the Dop-\npler corrected spectrum are similar to those obtained for 23O.\nThe absence of g peaks in the Doppler corrected spectrum of\n24O is an indication that the first excited state in this nucleus\nis above the neutron decay threshold. Analogous to the 23O\ncase, a simulation has been performed and compared to the\nexperimental result [see Fig. 12(b)]. This simulation assumes\na g transition at 3.7 MeV s2+\u21920+d and a 2+ feeding of 20%.\nSimilar to the case of 23O, a most conservative case has been\nchosen using the highest g-ray energy possible (the neutron\ndecay threshold in 24O being 3.7 MeV [21]). The value of\n20% for the feeding intensity of 2+ in 24O takes into account\ntwo contributions. One contribution comes from the nuclei\nproduced through 2p removal from 26Ne for which a value of\n12% has been deduced using the calculated spectroscopic\nfactors within the USD shell model. The second contribution\nis due to several nucleons removal fragmentation reactions;\nin this case a value of 35% is deduced for the feeding inten-\nsity.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nFrom the study of the excited states in 20\u221224O through\ntheir g decay, an estimate of the size of both N=14 and 16\nneutron gaps could be obtained. In both cases the gaps are\nlarge and hence 22O and 24O are both doubly magic nuclei.\nThe presence of the rather well bound doubly magic nucleus\n24O on the neutron drip line is a unique situation. These\nresults, as well all as other properties observed for\n20,21,22,23,24O, are in excellent agreement with predictions\nmade nearly 20 years ago using the USD effective Hamil-\ntonian. The T=1 part of the USD Hamiltonian, which is\nresponsible for this behavior is essentially different from that\npredicted from the renormalized G matrix and the reason for\nthe difference is not understood.\nIt appears that while the N=16 shell gap turns out to be\nlarger than 3 MeV in the heaviest oxygen isotopes, it is only\nof the order of 1 MeV in the silicon and magnesium iso-\ntopes. This can be accounted for by considering the role of\nthe strong n-p monopole interaction acting between the two\nspin-orbit partners pd5\/2 and nd3\/2 [22]. As the d5\/2 proton\norbital is emptied this interaction is released and the d3\/2\nneutron orbital is shifted towards the fp shell decreasing in\nthe same time the N=20 shell gap and increasing the N\n=16 gap. This evolution of the neutron d3\/2 orbital is com-\nplete in the Oxygen isotopes where the pd5\/2 is empty, mak-\ning the N=16 shell gap relatively larger. Such a large N\n=16 gap in oxygen isotopes is probably the reason why\nheavier isotopes having N=18 and 20 are neutron unbound\n(as the nd3\/2 lies at higher energy than in Mg and Si nuclei).\nFurther studies should be performed to detect the neutron\ndecay of the particle-unbound states of 23,24O or by using\ntransfer reactions in order to firmly establish the energy of\nthe first excited states in these nuclei and consequently de-\ntermine the size of the N=16 gap in oxygen. The determina-\ntion of the size of the N=16 gap in F and Ne is also impor-\ntant in order to complete the study of the single-particle\nevolution and its effect on the drip-line location in this re-\ngion.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe experiment using in-beam g-ray spectroscopy follow-\ning projectile fragmentation benefited from the smooth op-\neration of the accelerator by the GANIL operations team.\nThe use of segmented clover detectors was made possible by\nthe EXOGAM Collaboration.
